abstract: following promising data for metastatic breast cancer in terms of efﬁcacy and safety
proﬁle, third-generation aromatase inhibitors (ai), anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, underwent a full development in early setting. if recent results consistently show the superiority of
these agents over tamoxifen, the therapeutic strategies of ais in adjuvant setting are still debated.
beyond the choice of clinical strategy, the long duration of exposure to ai in adjuvant setting
required a full determination of the long-term toxicity proﬁle of these agents. while all three
ais have either favorable (decreased incidence of hot ﬂashes, gynecologic and thromboembolic
side-effects) or unfavorable (skeletal complications, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, sexual
dysfunction) class adverse events, some variability between ais has been reported in side-effects
as well as gastrointestinal, urogenital, neurologic, and visual disturbances, conﬁrming the lack
of interchangeability between the three ais. the overall therapeutic index of ais appears today
superior to that of tamoxifen with proven improved efﬁcacy and better toxicity proﬁle. this
review will explore the results from the available adjuvant ais trials with a particular emphasis
on safety proﬁles, quality of life, and therapeutic index, helping to deﬁne the present role of ais
in the adjuvant management of postmenopausal patients with breast cancer.

breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with a worldwide yearly estimate
of more than 1.1 million new cases of invasive breast cancer and more than 400,000
deaths per year, in keeping with a high prevalence (more than 4.0 million survivors
up to 5 years following diagnosis) (parkin et al 2005). early mammography screening programs and important therapeutic advances in the treatment of early (ebctcg
2005) and metastatic disease (andré et al 2004) are thought to be the most important
factors explaining this high prevalence.
in general, the treatment for patients with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer
involves removal of the tumor by surgical and/or radiolotherapeutic techniques, followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy. most patients will be treated with endocrine
therapy postoperatively, since the use of adjuvant therapy signiﬁcantly reduces the
risks of tumor recurrence (ebctcg 2005). in addition to endocrine therapies, adjuvant treatment may include chemotherapy, which has also been shown to increase
survival (ebctcg 2005).
when considering breast cancer carcinogenesis and therapeutic targeting, estrogens
and oestrogen receptors are among the most relevant prognostic and predictive factors
(colozza et al 2005). lifetime cumulative exposure to oestrogen and elevated levels of
plasma oestrogen are correlated with the risk of developing breast cancer (ehbccg
2002), and the  xxxg730xxx  (er) is increasingly expressed as normal epithelium
progresses to hyperplasia, hyperplasia with atypia, and ﬁnally ductal carcinoma in situ

(allred et al 2001). therefore, antagonizing oestrogen is a
logical approach to the treatment and prevention of breast
cancer.
over 100 years ago, beatson removed the ovaries of
a premenopausal woman with advanced breast cancer,
achieving a treatment response of 42 months’ duration
and demonstrating, for the ﬁrst time, the value of estrogen
withdrawal in the management of breast cancer (beatson
1896). contemporary endocrine therapy was introduced to
the clinic over 30 years ago. subsequent investigation has,
in the main, concentrated on providing additional endocrine
methods of depriving tumor cells of estrogen stimulation
or targeting the  xxxg730xxx  (er). the selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator (serm), tamoxifen, has been
for many years the standard adjuvant endocrine treatment
for postmenopausal women with er+ve and/or pgr+ve
disease. however, tamoxifen was shown to be associated
with side-effects, sometimes potentially life-threatening,
due to its partial oestrogen agonist activity; these sideeffects include an increased incidence of endometrial cancer
(wysowski et al 2002; ebctcg 2005) and thromboembolic events (fisher et al 1996) with an incidence related to
the drug exposure duration. the facts that many advanced
er+ve tumors fail to respond to tamoxifen, and those
that do respond ultimately acquire tamoxifen resistance,
pleaded in favor of alternative endocrine therapies (ring
and dowsett 2004). all these observations for tamoxifen led
to the search of new anti-hormonal agents with improved
therapeutic ratios.
the ﬁrst two generations of aromatase inhibitors (ais)
were introduced in the treatment of metastatic disease but,
mostly related to an unfavorable therapeutic index compared
to tamoxifen, did not reach the adjuvant setting (segalof et al
1962). more recently, third-generation ais (anastrozole,
letrozole, and exemestane) showed, for postmenopausal
women with advanced disease, superiority over other
hormonal agents, including  xxxd2557xxx  and most
importantly tamoxifen (buzdar et al 2002). these three
endocrine agents were subsequently studied extensively
in early breast cancer. in this article, we will review the
efﬁcacy and safety data of long-term use of ais for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with endocrine
sensitive breast cancer.

mechanism of action and
pharmacology
in postmenopausal women, the ais block the p450 cytochrome enzyme aromatase, responsible for the conversion

190

of androgens to estrogens via a pathway which is the main
source of oestrogen, consequently suppressing oestrogen
levels. in postmenopausal population, estrogens are produced
in the adrenal glands, the skin, the muscles, and the adipose
tissue (miller and dixon 2002). additionally, a majority
of breast tumors demonstrate the presence of intra-tumor
aromatase activity, a likely source of local oestrogen for the
tumor cells (bolufer et al 1992).
in contrast, for premenopausal women, ais induce
an increase in gonadotropin secretion secondary to the
reduced negative feedback of oestrogen to the pituitary. the
consequence is ovarian stimulation and a potential increase
in ovarian size which may result in ovarian cysts, thereby
conﬁrming the absence of indication of ai treatment in
premenopausal patients.
ais were ﬁrst developed as a non-surgical means to
reduce estrogen production in patients with hormoneresponsive tumors. the ﬁrst-generation ai,  xxxd147xxx , an inhibitor of adrenal steroidogenesis, was studied
almost 30 years ago. however, although signiﬁcantly suppressing estrogen production, this agent was non-speciﬁc,
altering as a consequence several intra-adrenal enzyme
pathways, and producing sedative side-effects at the level of
the central nervous system (samojlik et al 1980; perez and
borja 1992) subsequently, so-called ‘second-generation’
ais, such as  xxxd2153xxx  ( xxxd2153xxx ) and
 xxxd2080xxx  (cgs 16,949a), were found to be signiﬁcantly
more potent and better tolerated than  xxxd147xxx .
however, they did not show any beneﬁt over tamoxifen
(wiseman and mctavish 1993).
subsequently, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, research
focused on developing agents with increased potency and
higher selectivity. the identiﬁcation of two different mechanisms of aromatase inhibition led to the development of two
types of third-generation ais. type i aromatase inhibitors
are androgen analogues, which interfere with the substratebinding site of the enzyme and blocking the enzymatic
complex by producing an unbreakable covalent bond between
the inhibitor and the enzyme protein (they are also called
aromatase inactivators). exemestane is the only aromatase
inactivator available as endocrine therapy.
nonsteroidal type ii ais block the electron transfer chain
by the cytochrome p450 prosthetic group of the aromatase
complex, acting as competitive inhibitors reversibly bound
to the active enzymatic site. there are two type ii ais in
clinical practice: anastrozole and letrozole.
secondary to a good biodisponibility, all ais used in the
clinic are given orally, once daily. the time duration needed

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

aromatase inhibitors in treatment of breast cancer

to reach maximal estrogen suppression ranges from 2 to
7 days. the half-lives are quite different between the various ais: respectively 41 and 27 hours for anastrozole and
exemestane but longer for letrozole (96 hours). a likely
consequence is the plasma steady-state drug level of 7 days
achieved for anastrozole and exemestane and of 60 days for
letrozole (buzdar et al 2002).
all three third-generation ais effectively reduce estradiol (e2), estrone (e1), and estrone-sulfate (e1s) plasma
levels. one prospective trial compared the plasma e1, e1s,
and e2 suppression after 6 weeks of treatment with either
anastrozole or letrozole in postmenopausal patients with
advanced disease. letrozole was shown to be a slightly more
potent suppressor of plasma oestrogen levels and total body
aromatization compared to anastrozole (geisler et al 2002).
the clinical signiﬁcance of this observation is so far unclear.
there are to date no direct comparative studies involving
exemestane. additionally, some studies have suggested that
ais have the capability to reduce the production of intratumoral estrogens (buzdar et al 2002).

clinical development of aromatase
inhibitors
advanced breast cancer: rationale
for use in adjuvant setting
the superiority of third-generation ais over  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate in second-line therapy of advanced breast cancer led
to the decision to challenge tamoxifen in ﬁrst-line metastatic
as well as adjuvant settings.
two pivotal, large, randomized trials subsequently
showed anastrozole to significantly improve time-toprogression (ttp) compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal
women with hr+ve advanced breast cancer (10.7 months
vs 6.4 months, p = 0.022) (bonneterre et al 2000, 2001;
nabholtz et al 2000). a further combined analysis at a median
follow-up of 44 months also showed that anastrozole was at
least as effective as tamoxifen in terms of overall survival
(nabholtz et al 2003). tolerability beneﬁts were reported,
with anastrozole having signiﬁcantly fewer thromboembolic
events and a lower incidence of vaginal bleeding compared
to tamoxifen. no difference was observed between the two
treatment in terms of hot ﬂushes, bone fractures, or pain.
in the same setting, letrozole was reported to be superior
to tamoxifen in a large, randomized, double-blind trial with
signiﬁcantly improved response rates and time-to-progression
(9.4 months and 6 months, p = 0.0001) (mouridsen et al
2003). the tolerability proﬁle was also more favorable for

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

letrozole with a decreased incidence of thromboembolic
events. no difference was noted between the therapies in
terms of hot ﬂushes, arthralgias, or bone pain. however,
there was a suggestion that letrozole may slightly increase
the cholesterol plasma levels.
in another randomized phase iii trial, exemestane showed
signiﬁcant improvements compared to tamoxifen in terms
of response rate (46% vs 31%, p  0.05), clinical beneﬁt
(66% vs 49%, p  0.05), and time-to-progression (10 months
vs 6 months, p  0.05) (paridaens et al 2004). the safety
proﬁle was also favorable for exemestane with fewer hot
ﬂushes and a suggestion that the steroidal ai may have no
impact on the bone and lipid metabolisms.
only one randomized open-label phase iiib/iv trial
has compared compared two ais (letrozole vs anastrozole)
in advanced breast cancer previously treated with an antioestrogen (rose et al 2003). the overall response rate
(orr) was signiﬁcantly higher with letrozole (19.1% vs
12.3%, p = 0.013), but there was no difference between the
treatment arms in terms of clinical beneﬁt and ttp. both
agents were well tolerated and there were no signiﬁcant differences in safety proﬁles.

aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant
treatment for breast cancer
results from the ebctcg trialists panel conﬁrmed that,
before the emergence of third-generation ais, adjuvant
tamoxifen for 5 years (only for hormonal receptor-positive
disease) reduced the annual breast cancer death rate by 31%,
irrespective of the use of chemotherapy, age, progesterone
receptor status, or other tumor characteristics (ebctcg
2005). five years’ duration of tamoxifen treatment was
considered optimal, being signiﬁcantly more effective than
10 years’ or 2 years’ and less. moreover, two additional
observations deserved to be mentioned:
1. the risk of recurrence is high in the ﬁrst 5 years after
a diagnosis of breast cancer, but with the highest peak
within 2–3 years of diagnosis, independently of nodal
status (saphner et al 1996). this observation supports
the upfront use of the most powerful new drugs (risk of
early relapse)
2. for er+ve tumors, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0–4 and 5–14, with
2/3 of deaths occuring between years 5 and 15. this
observation is in favor of the potential increased duration of adjuvant endocrine therapies beyond 5 years,
pending improved efﬁcacy and good long-term toxicity
proﬁles. additionally, caution should be exercised when

interpreting overall survival data of adjuvant trials for
endocrine sensitive breast cancers: longer median followups, such as 8–15 years, are needed to fully evaluate
the real impact of new endocrine treatments on overall
survival.
four different strategies were developed with thirdgeneration ais in adjuvant setting (see available results
in table 1):
1. the upfront strategy: as noted above, it appears highly
important for women to receive the most effective adjuvant therapy at the ﬁrst opportunity in order to minimize
the early risk of relapse. various trials compared ais
to tamoxifen for 5 years: anastrozole in the atac trial
(atac trialists’ group 2002, 2003, 2005), letrozole in
the big 1–98 trial (coates et al 2007), and exemestane
in the team trial (data not yet available). anastrozole
and letrozole were shown to be superior to tamoxifen in
terms of disease-free survival, time to recurrence, time to
distant recurrence, and incidence of controlateral breast
cancer. overall survival data are presently inconclusive,
most likely because of short median follow-ups for survival (atac: 68 months and big 1-98: 51 months).
2. the sequential strategy: it could be important to introduce the most effective adjuvant therapy when the
risk of tamoxifen resistance is the highest (after the
2nd year). the big 1-98 trial is the only study with a
4-arm design comparing the 5-year sequence of either
tamoxifen followed by letrozole or the inverse (letrozole
followed by tamoxifen) to either 5 years of tamoxifen
or letrozole. to date, no prospective data are available
comparing upfront ais to a sequence of tamoxifen-ai.
results from the sequential part of the big 1-98 study
with letrozole will be available in the future. these data
are eagerly awaited as this is the only trial comparing
5 years of ai with 2 sequential strategies (tamoxifenletrozole and letrozole-tamoxifen), which will resolve
the conceptual debate ‘sequential tamoxifen-ai versus
upfront ai’.
3. switch strategy: switching to an ai after 2 or 3 years
of tamoxifen for patients presently on tamoxifen (total
of 5 years) has been evaluated with either exemestane:
ies (coombes et al 2004, 2007) or anastrozole: ita trial
(boccardo et al 2005a, b) and abcsg8/arno studies
(jakecz et al 2005a). the switch strategy has frequently
been confounded with the sequential strategy. the
difference between the two approaches lies in the fact
that the switch trials censor patients who have relapsed
during the ﬁrst 2–3 years on tamoxifen, thus selecting a

192

subpopulation of patients with higher endocrine sensitivity
(as we can assume that patients who relapse early might
be the least sensitive to hormonetherapy). sequence trials
include all patients from the onset of adjuvant endocrine
therapy and thus all patients relapsing on tamoxifen during
the ﬁrst 2–3 years of treatment are included as events in
the trial analysis without any selection from the standpoint
of endocrine sensitivity. as a consequence it is fallacious
to use switch trials to reach conclusions on sequential
strategies. switching from tamoxifen to exemestane or
anastrozole was reported to signiﬁcantly improve diseasefree survival and time to distant recurrence compared to
continuing tamoxifen. additionally, improved survival
data are presently emerging with both ais.
4. extended hormonetherapy strategy: the duration of
hormonal treatment in adjuvant situation is an old
question, but remains a fundamental issue. results
from the ebctg analysis (ebctcg 2005) clearly
demonstrated that 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy
was better than shorter durations. however, data from
the national surgical adjuvant breast project (nsabp)
b-14 trial failed to demonstrate a positive impact of
prolonged tamoxifen treatment (10 years vs 5 years).
this was related not only to a worse toxicity proﬁle seen
with prolonged tamoxifen, but also to decreased efﬁcacy,
most likely related to the estrogen agonist effect seen
with long-term use of tamoxifen (fisher et al 2004).
considering the facts that adjuvant tamoxifen induced a
carry-over effect  xxxd1891xxx  and 15 years even when the treatment
was stopped early, and that there is a signiﬁcant incidence of
endocrine-sensitive patients having late relapses after 5–15
years (ebctcg 2005), the third-generation ais were considered good candidates for trying to optimize the duration
of adjuvant therapy while potentially taking advantage of
the sequential approach. this led to two trials, both evaluating the role of introducing an ai after 5 years of adjuvant
tamoxifen: one with letrozole vs placebo, national cancer
institute of canada (ncic) ma 17 (goss et al 2003, 2005)
and the other one with anastrozole abcsg 6a (jakecz
et al 2005b; schmid et al 2003). a third trial involving
exemestane (nsabp b-33) was closed after publication
of the results of the ma17 study (table 1).
the ai prolonged trials with letrozole and anastrozole
demonstrate the beneﬁt of extending hormonal therapy
beyond 5 years of tamoxifen. these results raise the
question of the duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy
beyond 5 years as well as the potential role played in
these trials by the sequencing tamoxifen-ai.

the real questions beyond these all these results are: how
long should we expose the patients to ais in adjuvant setting?
should we go beyond 5 years? should we start ai upfront and
for how long? beyond the decision making of using ais and
how to use them in adjuvant setting remains the choice of ai
to use among the 3 agents available in the clinic. there is no
direct comparison between the molecules in adjuvant setting
and thus the decision to use either agent should be based upon
their respective efﬁcacy and most importantly their respective
toxicity proﬁles with maturity of data and availability of
results in the various reviewed clinical strategies.

toxicity profile of aromatase
inhibitors
it is critically important to prospectively assess the long
term side-effect proﬁle of ais, as these agents have entered
the adjuvant setting while the present recommendation
for the duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy is 5 years.
because of short median exposure to hormone therapy,
safety reports acquired from advanced breast cancer trials
are usually sketchy, underestimating the toxicity proﬁle of
new endocrine agents. at best, they provide some guidance
to prospectively design the assessment of adverse events
in adjuvant studies. getting long-term prospective toxicity

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

information is critical to evaluate the therapeutic index for
new hormone therapy such as ais.
overall, the rate of adverse events (ae) did not differ
with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen in the atac
trial (68 months median follow-up: respectively 93.9% vs
94.6%, p = ns) while the rate of drug-related ae leading to
withdrawal was lower for patients treated with anastrozole
(6.5% vs 8.9%, p = 0.0005) (atac trialists’ group 2005). in
the big 1-98 trial with median follow-up of 51 months, more
ae were observed with letrozole compared to tamoxifen
(93.6% vs 88.4%) (coates et al 2007). no difference in ae
was reported in the ies between exemestane and tamoxifen
(median follow-up: 55 months; respectively 92.5% vs 92.6,
p = ns) (coombes et al 2007).
in the atac trial, the incidence of serious adverse events
(sae) was signiﬁcantly lower with anastrozole vs tamoxifen
(33.3% vs 36%, p = 0.03) while drug-related saes were less
frequently seen with anastrozole (4.7% vs 9.0%, p = 0.0001). lifethreatening sae were reported in similar proportion between
letrozole and tamoxifen in the big 1-98 study (respectively
4.6% vs 3.8%) as were grade 3–4 aes with exemestane versus
tamoxifen in the ies (respectively 18.4% vs 17.6%).
when reviewing all side-effects induced by long-term use
of ais versus tamoxifen, a trend seems to emerge (table 2).

(lipid metabolism, cardiac, cerebrovascular, and others).

class effects of ais, favorable to ais
hot flushes and night sweats
hot ﬂushes are frequently observed in adjuvant studies with
endocrine agents with a usually high incidence, independently
of the type of hormone therapy used, including placebo. consequently, hot ﬂushes were prospectively assessed in the main
adjuvant trials with ais. in the atac study, the rate of hot
ﬂushes was signiﬁcantly lower with anastrozole compared to
tamoxifen (35.7% vs 40.9%, p  0.0001). the big 1–98 study
found also a signiﬁcant improvement in favor of letrozole vs
tamoxifen for hot ﬂushes (respectively 32.8% vs 37.4%, p 
0.001) and night sweats (respectively 14.2% vs 17.0%, p =
0.007). however, when compared to placebo in the ma 17 trial,
patients on letrozole experienced more hot ﬂushes (58% vs 54%,
p = 0.003). in contrast, a higher incidence of hot ﬂushes and
menopausal symptoms was reported with exemestane compared
to tamoxifen in the ies, although without reaching the level of
statistical signiﬁcance (hot ﬂushes: 42.4% vs 39.9%, p = 0.08;
menopausal symptoms:47.8% vs 45.1%, p = 0.06).

gynecologic (table 3)
tamoxifen is known to have an oestrogenic effect on healthy
endometrial tissue with consequences such as endometrial

194

proliferation and thickening. long-term use of tamoxifen has
previously been associated with an increased risk of polyp
formation, vaginal bleeding, and increased incidence of
endometrial cancer (bissett et al 1994; ebctcg 2005,). in
contrast, ais induce uterine atrophy and may decrease tamoxifen-induced changes, secondary to a prior course of therapy.
as expected when compared to tamoxifen, ai therapy
resulted in fewer gynecological aes. in the atac trial,
gynecologic events (including endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial neoplasia, cervical neoplasia, and enlarged uterine
ﬁbroids) were less frequent with anastrozole compared to
tamoxifen (3.0% vs 10.0%; p  0.0001). as well, a lower
incidence of gynecologic saes was reported with exemestane
versus tamoxifen in the ies (5.9% vs 9.0%; p = 0.0002).
when prospectively assessed, vaginal bleeding was signiﬁcantly less frequent with anastrozole than tamoxifen in the
atac study (5.4% vs 10.2%; p  0.0001), as with letrozole in
the big 1–98 trial (3.8% vs 8.3%; p  0.0001) and exemestane
in the ies (4.6% vs 6.5%; p  0.008). the abcsg 8/arno
95 trials reported the combined incidence of vaginal bleeding
and discharge, showing no difference between anastrozole
and tamoxifen (18% vs 17%; p = 0.93). however, these safety
results should be viewed with caution in these combined trials
as adverse events were not prespeciﬁed in the arno 95 study
protocol. interestingly, when letrozole was compared to placebo in the ma17 trial, vaginal bleeding was more frequent in
patients treated with the placebo, conﬁrming the uterine effect
of letrozole (8.0% vs 6.0%; p = 0.005). one consequence of
vaginal bleeding is to mandate further investigations to rule
out endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. in the atac study,
signiﬁcantly fewer patients on anastrozole underwent hysterectomies compared with those treated with tamoxifen (1.3% vs
5.1%; p  0.0001). in the ies, the rate of uterine dilatation and
curettage was signiﬁcantly lower with exemestane compared to
tamoxifen (0.6% vs 1.4%; p = 0.009) and signiﬁcantly fewer
patients treated with exemestane were diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia (0.1% vs 1.0%; p  0.0001) and uterine
polyps/ﬁbroids (1.2% vs 3.2%; p  0.0001) compared to those
on tamoxifen. of note, in this trial, the rate of hysterectomy
was similar between the two treatment groups.
vaginal discharge is usually related to a postmenopausal
deﬁcit in estrogen, vaginal atrophy, and alkalinity. in the
atac trial, fewer patients on anastrozole experienced vaginal
discharge compared to those treated with tamoxifen (3.5%
vs 13.2%; p  0.0001). in addition vaginal moniliasis was

vaginal discharge compared to women treated with exemestane in the ies (3.9% vs 2.8%; p  0.04).
it has been established that the long-term use of
tamoxifen bears an increased risk of endometrial cancer
(ebctcg 2005). results with ais conﬁrm a decreased
risk of endometrial cancer compared to tamoxifen. in the
atac trial, 5 patients were diagnosed with endometrial
cancers compared to 17 on tamoxifen (0.22% vs 0.76%;
p = 0.02). similar results were published with letrozole
vs tamoxifen in the big 1–98 study (16 cases vs 4 cases;
p  0.05). for the switch trials, the incidence of endometrial
cancer in the ies was doubled with tamoxifen compared to
exemestane but did not reached the statistical signiﬁcance
(0.4% vs 0.2%, p = ns) while there was a trend for fewer
endometrial cancers with anastrozole vs tamoxifen in the
abcsg8/arno95 combined studies (p = 0.069). finally,
when compared to placebo in the ma 17 trial, only 4 patients
on letrozole were reported having an endometrial cancer
compared to 11 on placebo (p = 0.12).

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

thromboembolic disease (table 4)
it is known that breast cancer patients may develop thromboembolic complications when physiological antithrombotic systems
are defective or when prothrombotic activities overcome the
normal physiological antithrombotic mechanisms (schmitt et al
1999). venous thromboembolism classically occurs in patients
with clinically overt cancer and may develop at any stage of the
disease (agnelli 1997). treatments such as chemotherapy and
certain endocrine therapies have been shown to further compound
the risk of thromboembolic complications. in breast cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy, the incidence of thrombosis
has been reported to range from 1.3% (stages i-iii) to 17.6%
(stage iv), with the highest risk observed in postmenopausal
patients (levine 1997). tamoxifen has also been associated with
a small but signiﬁcant increased risk of venous thromboembolism, which is further worsened by the addition of chemotherapy.
this increase in thromboembolic disease seen with tamoxifen is
considered to be a consequence of its partial oestrogen receptoragonist activity in certain tissues (schmitt et al 1999).

third-generation ais, however, are potent inhibitors
of oestrogen synthesis and have all been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of thromboembolism compared
with tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women with
breast cancer. both upfront therapy trials (atac and big
1–98) reported signiﬁcant decreases in the rate of thromboembolic complications with the ai compared to tamoxifen (anastrozole: 3% vs 5%, p = 0.0004; letrozole: 2.3%
vs 3.8%, p  0.001). as well, in switch trials (ies and
abcsg 8/arno 95), exemestane induced fewer thromboembolic events compared to tamoxifen (1.2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.004)
and there were fewer thromboses on anastrozole vs tamoxifen
(p = 034), with a trend for fewer embolic events on anastrozole
(p = 0.064). lastly, when comparing letrozole to placebo in the
ma 17 study, there was no signiﬁcant difference in terms of
thromboembolic events between the two patient groups.

class effects of ais, favorable
to tamoxifen
skeletal complications (table 5)
tamoxifen is known to have a positive effect on bone mineral
density in postmenopausal breast cancer patients (powles

196

et al 1996), but to date, tamoxifen has not been evaluated in
a prospective trial in women with osteoporosis.
patients treated in all the adjuvant large-scale randomized
trials with anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane clearly had
an increasing rate of skeletal disorders, particularly osteoporosis and bone fractures, even in trials in which they were
compared to placebo.
in the atac trial, anastrozole was associated with a signiﬁcant increased incidence of fractures compared to tamoxifen (11.0% vs 7.7%, p  0.0001). while the incidences of
hip fractures (fracture type associated with high morbidity
and mortality) and wrist fractures were similar for anastrozole and tamoxifen (respectively, 1.2% vs 1.0%, p = 0.5 and
2.3% vs 2.0%, p = 0.4), the difference was signiﬁcant in favor
of tamoxifen for spinal fractures (1.5% vs 0.9%, p = 0.03)
and all other sites of fractures (7.1% vs 4.6%, p  0.0001).
interestingly, the yearly fracture rate on anastrozole increased
sharply compared to tamoxifen during the ﬁrst 2 years of
therapy before stabilizing, with a relative risk of fracture
remaining constant with longer duration of treatment (atac
trialists’ group 2006). finally at completion of therapy, the
fracture rate reversed back to the lower rate observed with

tamoxifen (locker and eastell 2003). as expected, in the
abcsg/arno trial, there were signiﬁcantly more fractures
in patients switching to anastrozole versus those continuing
on tamoxifen (2.4% vs 1.2%, p = 0.015).
letrozole also bears an increased risk of fractures on the
head-to-head comparison with tamoxifen (8.6% vs 5.8%,
p  0.001) (coates et al 2007). a more detailed analysis of
osteoporosis and bone fractures was published for the ma17
trial exploring the impact of extending treatment with letrozole compared to placebo (goss et al 2005). more patients
receiving letrozole had a new diagnosis of self-reported
osteoporosis (8.1% vs 6.0%, p = 0.003) with a median time
to occurrence of 0.70 years for those receiving letrozole
and 0.52 years for those receiving placebo. of a total of 256
patients who experienced a clinical fracture during the study
period, 137 (5.3%) were taking letrozole and 119 (4.6%) were
on placebo (p = 0.25). the median time to fracture was 1.06
year letrozole and 0.86 year for the placebo.
even if preclinical data suggested that exemestane may yield
a protective effect on bone metabolism, ies reported an increased
incidence of osteoporosis with exemestane compared to tamoxifen (7.3% vs 5.5%, p = 0.01). similarly, bone fractures were more
frequent in the exemestane group compared to the tamoxifen
group (4.3% vs 3.1%, p = 0.03) (coombes et al 2007).
despite these results, there is today no skeletal contraindication to the use of ais in adjuvant setting. however, it is
strongly recommended for patients, in particular for those
with risk factors of osteoporosis, to determine the bone mineral density (bmd) status and the phosphocalcic metabolism,
before initiating an ai therapy (winer et al 2005). in case of
normal upfront bmd, it is advised to proceed with another
test at completion of adjuvant treatment with ai. in case of
upfront osteopenia, another bmd should be performed after
1–2 years on ai therapy. finally, an upfront osteoporotic

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

result should lead to the possible use of bisphosphonates
concomitantly with the ai following promising preliminary
reports showing a positive impact of bisphosphonates on the
prevention of osteoporosis (gnant et al 2004).

arthralgia and musculoskeletal pain (table 5)
in clinical practice, the main symptomatic issue with ais
remains arthralgias and ﬁbromyalgias for which no clear
physiopathological explanation is known and no speciﬁc treatment deﬁned. their assessment in the various adjuvant trials
with ais has been complex, mostly because of a lack of clear
deﬁnition (arthralgia, arthritis, osteoarthritis, myalgia, muscle
cramps, ﬁbromyalgia, bone pain, musculoskeletal pain).
in the atac trial, arthralgia was a predeﬁned adverse
event and was recorded as a grouping of arthralgia, arthritis,
arthrosis, and joint disorders (buzdar et al 2006). signiﬁcantly more patients treated with anastrozole presented with
arthralgia compared to those on tamoxifen (35.6% vs 29.4%,
p  0.0001). the median time to ﬁrst event was 13.9 months
for anastrozole and 17.7 months for tamoxifen. serious events
were noted in similar proportions between the two treatment
groups (10.6% for anastrozole and 10.4% for tamoxifen).
few patients from either group withdrew from treatment
because of arthralgia (13 vs 6). more than 50% of patients
with joint symptoms received treatment for pain management. more than 90% of these patients were managed with
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs alone or in combination with other mild analgesics. as nonpre-speciﬁed adverse
events, muscle cramps were more frequent with tamoxifen
than anastrozole (8% vs 4%, p  0.0001) while carpal tunnel
syndrome was observed more with anastrozole (3% vs 1%,
p  0.0001). in the switch portion of the austrian abcsg 8
trial, bone pain was more frequent with anastrozole compared
to tamoxifen (p = 0.054).

197

nabholtz

arthralgia and myalgia were not prespeciﬁed in the
big 1–98 trial, but were part of an ‘other’ category and
thus could be underestimated. nevertheless, letrozole
induced more arthralgia than tamoxifen (20.0% vs 13.5%,
p  0.001). when looking at the grading according to
the national cancer institute common toxicity criteria
(version 2.0), the great majority of patients with arthralgia
in the letrozole arm suffered grade 1–2 (444 pts of 489,
90.8%) with only 43 cases of grade 3 (8.8%) and 2 cases
of grade 4 (0.4%). there was no signiﬁcant difference in
terms of myalgia between the 2 treatment groups (p = 0.19).
interestingly, the ma 17 trial comparing letrozole to placebo found more patients with myalgias in the letrozole
arm (15% vs 12%, p = 0.004) while bone pain was recorded
in comparable proportion of cases between the 2 arms
(letrozole: 5% vs placebo:6%, p = 0.67). nevertheless,
arthralgias were more frequent with letrozole compared
to placebo (25% vs 21%, p  0.001).
in the switch ies, there was a higher frequency of
arthralgia in the exemestane group compared to tamoxifen
(18.6% vs 11.8%, p  0.0001). the incidence of arthritis was also higher with exemestane (14.1% vs 12.0%,
p  0.03) while osteoarthritis was reported in similar
proportion between the two treatment groups (8.7% vs
7.4%, p = 0.113). carpal tunnel syndrome was more frequent on exemestane versus tamoxifen (2.8% vs 0.0%,
p  0.0001). finally, musculoskeletal pain was observed
in 21% of patients on exemestane versus 16% for those on
tamoxifen (p  0.0001).

sexual dysfunction (table 3)
sexual dysfunction is a frequent event for patients treated
with endocrine therapy, although potentially under-reported
in breast cancer studies. sexual dysfunction was usually
assessed in the various adjuvant trials with ais either as non
predeﬁned adverse events (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia,
loss of libido) or as part of quality of life (qol) modules
(whelan et al 2005; cella et al 2006; fallowﬁeld et al 2006).
secondary to low estrogen levels, vaginal dryness can induce
dyspareunia as well as decreased libido. as expected, vaginal
dryness was more frequently seen with ais compared to
tamoxifen in the atac and ma 17 trials. more patients on
anastrozole than tamoxifen reported dyspareunia (28 vs 9,
p = 0.002) and decreased libido (39 vs 12, p = 0.0001) (cella
et al 2006). quality of life studies in the ma 17 trial showed a
signiﬁcant worsening of the parameters of the sexual domain
with letrozole compared to placebo (whelan et al 2005). as
well, sexual dysfunction was also observed with exemestane

198

in the ies, but without reaching the statistical signiﬁcance
when compared to tamoxifen (fallowﬁeld et al 2006).

side effects specific to given ais
lipid metabolism
postmenopausal women are known to have increased levels
of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and decreased
levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) compared to premenopausal women of the same age, and these
unfavorable changes are considered to be a risk factor for
the development of coronary heart disease (gorodeski 2002).
there is no clear evidence that tamoxifen favorably inﬂuences the lipid metabolism especially when considering the
results from the women’s health initiative study (rossouw
et al 2002). it is, therefore, important to ascertain whether
or not long-term treatment with anastrozole, letrozole, or
exemestane has an impact on the lipid parameters.
anastrozole was ﬁrst assessed in advanced breast cancer studies in a combined analysis of the north american
and tamoxifen or arimidex randomized group efﬁcacy
and tolerability (target) trials. this study on 600 postmenopausal patients concluded that neither anastrozole nor
tamoxifen had a clinically signiﬁcant impact on total cholesterol (dewar et al 2000). other studies in metastatic breast
cancer, consistent with this analysis, showed no signiﬁcant
change in total cholesterol, ldl-c, hdl-c, or triglycerides. furthermore, there was no change in the atherogenic
risk ratios of total cholesterol/hdl-c and ldl-c/hdl-c
(wojtacki et al 2004).
in early breast cancer, a small study evaluated the effects
of anastrozole on lipid proﬁles of 54 postmenopausal women.
anastrozole induced no signiﬁcant change of serum levels
of  xxxg173xxx ,  xxxg175xxx , triglycerides, total
cholesterol, hdl-c, and ldl-c. atherogenic risk ratios
(total cholesterol/hdl-c, ldl-c/hdl-c and  xxxg173xxx / xxxg175xxx ) were stable from baseline to various measurements at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (wojtacki et al
2005). additionally, potential changes in serum lipid proﬁles
were investigated in a neoadjuvant randomized trial (n = 176)
comparing anastrozole or tamoxifen alone or in combination. treatment with either tamoxifen or anastrozole for 12
weeks was associated with a signiﬁcant increase of hdl-c
levels in both groups, whereas total cholesterol decreased in
the tamoxifen group and increased in the anastrozole group,
although not signiﬁcantly (banerjee et al 2005). following
these results with anastrozole on lipid parameters in advanced
breast cancer, serum lipid levels were not prospectively studied in the atac trial. hypercholesterolemia was assessed

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

aromatase inhibitors in treatment of breast cancer

as a nonpre-deﬁned adverse event and results showed an
increased incidence with anastrozole versus tamoxifen in
the ‘completion of 5 years’ treatment analysis’ (9% vs 3%,
p  0.0001) (atac trialists’ group 2006).
the impact of letrozole on lipid composition was initially
measured in a small study of 20 postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer. results showed a signiﬁcant
increase in total cholesterol (p 0.05), ldl-c (p  0.01) and
 xxxg175xxx  levels (p = 0.05) after 16 weeks of treatment. in addition, there was evidence of unfavorable changes
in the atherogenic risk ratios of total cholesterol/hdl-c
(p  0.005), ldl-c/hdl-c (p  0.005) and apolipoprotein
a1/ xxxg175xxx  (p = 0.005) (elisaf et al 2001). consequently, hypercholesterolemia was prospectively studied in
the big 1–98 trial. results showed a signiﬁcantly higher
prevalence for hypercholesterolemia in patients treated with
letrozole versus those receiving tamoxifen (respectively
50.6% vs 24.6%, p  0.001). however, the great majority
(99%) of these cases of hypercholesterolemia were graded
1 or 2 (coates 2007). in contrast, the ma.17 lipid substudy
showed no signiﬁcant changes induced by letrozole on cholesterol (including ldl or hdl fractions) (16% vs 16%,
p = 0.79), triglycerides or lipoprotein over a period of treatment
of 3 years following 5 years of tamoxifen (wasan 2005).
exemestane was ﬁrst evaluated in a 9-week study, in which
plasma changes in advanced breast cancer patients demonstrated a signiﬁcant decrease in total cholesterol (p  0.01),
triglycerides (p = 0.023) and  xxxg173xxx  (p  0.01).
additionally, there was also a signiﬁcant decrease in hdl-c
(p  0.01) and in the  xxxg173xxx / xxxg175xxx 
atherogenic risk ratio (p  0.01) (engan et al 1995).
in contrast, a substudy of an advanced breast cancer phase
ii randomized trial did not ﬁnd the treatment with either
exemestane or tamoxifen to have a signiﬁcant effect on total
cholesterol, hdl-c,  xxxg173xxx , or apolipoprotein
b. however, at week 24, exemestane was associated with a
signiﬁcant increase in triglycerides (p = 0.002) (atalay et al
2004). in the ies, there was no difference in hypercholesterolemia levels between patients on exemestane versus those
treated with continued tamoxifen (7.2% vs 6.0%, p = 0.12)
(coombes et al 2007).
in terms of comparative studies between the ais, an early
breast cancer study compared the effects of adjuvant exemestane and anastrozole on serum lipids in postmenopausal
women (kataja et al 2002). after 12 weeks of treatment,
exemestane and anastrozole had no clinically signiﬁcant
impact on total cholesterol, hdl-c, ldl-c or triglycerides
compared with baseline. anastrozole did, however, show

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

an increase in hdl-c levels whereas exemestane showed a
decreased hdl-c levels. a second small randomized study,
the letrozole, exemestane, and anastrozole pharmacodynamics trial (leap) compared the lipid proﬁles of 90 evaluable
healthy volunteers, receiving either anastrozole (1 mg/day),
letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or exemestane (25 mg/day) once
daily for 24 weeks (mccloskey 2005). results showed no
signiﬁcant changes of lipid parameters for women exposed
to anastrozole. while letrozole induced a signiﬁcant increase
in triglycerides levels without effect on the atherogenic ratios.
exposure to exemestane resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of
the atherogenic ratios ldl-c/hdl-c and  xxxg175xxx /
 xxxg173xxx , compared to anastrozole and letrozole.
the molecular differences between anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, therefore, could not only affect the
selectivity for the aromatase complex with small differences
in plasma oestrogen suppression, but could also play a role
in the small variations in lipid alterations induced by the
third-generation ais. although these differences between the
ais may not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the clinical efﬁcacy, it is
unknown so far whether or not these modiﬁed lipid proﬁles
may translate into a long-term increased risk of cardiovascular (cv) disease.

cardiac adverse events (table 4)
no cardiac safety issues were identiﬁed for any of the ais in
the advanced breast cancer setting. however, the duration of
exposure to the drugs was relatively short and cv events were
not a particular focus of safety analyses in these metastatic
trials (nabholtz and glogorov 2006).
in the last analysis of the atac trial (68 months median
follow-up), the incidence of ischemic cardiac disease was
comparable for patients treated with anastrozole compared
with those on tamoxifen (4.1% vs 3.4%, p = 0.10) (atac
trialists’ group 2005). there was a numerical increase,
although not statistically signiﬁcant, in terms of angina with
anastrozole compared to tamoxifen (71 cases vs 51 cases,
p = 0.07). however, this was not considered to be a safety
concern, as there was no correlation with prolonged treatment, and the majority of events were mild to moderate in
severity. additionally, there was no difference in myocardial
infarctions between anastrozole and tamoxifen at 68 months
(37 cases vs 34 cases, p = 0.7) (atac trialists’ group 2006)
while the number of cv deaths was similar in the two treatment groups (49 vs 46, respectively).
in keeping with these data, no difference in myocardial
infarctions were observed in the abcsg 8/arno 95 trials
for patients switching to anastrozole compared with those

199

nabholtz

continuing tamoxifen (2 cases vs 3 cases). available cv
data from the ita trial are limited to the incidence of cv
disease, which showed no signiﬁcant difference between the
tamoxifen group and the anastrozole group (9.3% and 7.9%,
respectively; p = 0.4) (boccardo et al 2005b).
the recent updated analysis of the big 1–98 trial, at
51 months median follow-up, reported no signiﬁcant difference
in incidence of any grade cardiac events between letrozole
and tamoxifen (5.5% vs 5.0%, p = 0.48) (coates 2007).
however, patients on letrozole experienced a signiﬁcantly
greater incidence of grade 3–5 cardiac events than those on
tamoxifen (74 cases vs 35 cases, p  0.05). these events
consisted mostly of ischiemic heart disease (42 cases vs 21
cases, p  0.05) and cardiac failures (24 cases vs 14 cases).
cardiac deaths were reported in 11 cases on letrozole and 5
on tamoxifen. of particular interest is the fact that there was
no clear evidence of correlation between cardiac deaths and
the statistically signiﬁcant increased number of hypercholesterolemia in the letrozole arm. clearly, these results should
be put in the context of the total number of deaths without
cancer event (letrozole: 60 vs tamoxifen: 48) and the total
number of deaths in the trial (letrozole: 194 vs tamoxifen:211,
p = ns) (coates et al 2007).
cardiovascular data from the ma17 (letrozole arm: 2593
patients and placebo arm: 2394 patients) showed no overall
signiﬁcant difference between letrozole and placebo in terms
of cv disease (respectively 5.8% and 5.6%, p = 0.76), including myocardial infarction and new or worsening angina.
in the ies at 55 months’ median follow-up, there was
no signiﬁcant difference in the overall incidence of cv
events (excluding thromboembolism) between the two
treatment arms (exemestane: 16.5% vs tamoxifen: 15.0%,
p = 0.16) (coombes et al 2007). the incidence of ischiemic
cardiovascular disease was comparable between the 2 arms
(exemestane: 8.0% vs tamoxifen: 6.9%, p = 0.17) and, in
contrast with preliminary reports, there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference in terms of myocardial infarctions
between patients on exemestane and those on tamoxifen
(respectively 31 cases vs 19 cases, p = 0.08). of particular
note is the fact that 22 patients on exemestane (71%) had
a prior history of high blood pressure compared to only 6
patients on tamoxifen. the number of deaths due to cardiac
causes was very low in both arms.

cerebrovascular adverse events (table 4)
consistent with the initial analyses of the atac study,
ischemic cerebrovascular adverse events at 68 months were
signiﬁcantly reduced for patients treated with anastrozole

200

compared with those treated with tamoxifen (62 cases/2% vs
88 cases/3%, p = 0.03). this translated in 14 cerebrovascular
deaths on anatrozole vs 22 on tamoxifen (p = ns).
none of the other adjuvant trials, with letrozole and
exemestane, showed any evidence of decreased cerebrovacular events compared to tamoxifen or placebo. in the
big 1–98 trial, there was no difference in the incidence of
cerebrovascular adverse events/transient ischemic attack
between letrozole and tamoxifen (1.4% vs 1.4%, p = 0.90). a
total of 7 cerebrovascular deaths were reported, 4 on letrozole
and 3 on tamoxifen. as well, the ma 17 showed a similar
rate of cerebrovascular adverse events between letrozole and
placebo (0.7% vs 0.6%, p = ns). lastly, these events occurred
in similar proportion between exemestane and tamoxifen in
the ies (2.5% vs 2.4%, p = 0.89).

other adverse events (table 2)
the gastrointestinal toxicity of ais is usually mild with
no evidence of increased nausea/vomiting compared to
tamoxifen or placebo. however, diarrhea appeared to be
signiﬁcantly more frequent with exemestane compared to
tamoxifen in the ies (4.2% vs 2.2%, p  0.0001) and with
anastrozole in the atac trial (9% vs 7%, p = 0.02). however,
no difference in diarrhea was noted between anastrozole and
tamoxifen in the abcsg 8/arno 95 study and between
letrozole and placebo in the ma 17 trial.
urogenital side-effects were only reported in the atac
trial with a signiﬁcant decreased incidence of urinary
incontinence with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen
(2.0% vs 4.0%, p  0.0001) and less urinary tract infections for patients on the ai versus tamoxifen (8% vs 10%,
p = 0.002).
mild neurologic toxicity was recorded with anastrozole
in the atac study consisting of paresthesia seen more
frequently than with tamoxifen (7% vs 5%, p = 0.0001).
exemestane, as well, induced an increased incidence of
paresthesia compared to tamoxifen in the ies (2.8% vs
1.0%, p  0.0001).
high blood pressure was more frequent with anastrozole vs
tamoxifen in the atac trial (13% vs 11%, p = 0.04) and with
exemestane in the ies (35.8% vs 33.0%, p = 0.05). the ma
17 showed no difference between letrozole and placebo.
in terms of visual disturbances, there was no difference in the atac trial for cataracts (prespeciﬁed ae)
between anastrozole and tamoxifen. visual disturbances
(unspeciﬁed types) were reported to be more frequent with
exemestane vs tamoxifen in the preliminary analysis of ies
at 30.7 months median follow-up (7.4% vs 5.7%, p 0.05)

(coombes et al 2004). however, there was no update on
visual toxicity in the recent publication at median follow-up
of 55 months (coombes et al 2007).

quality of life with of aromatase
inhibitors
when considering the role of new endocrine therapy in
early breast cancer, efﬁcacy and safety with in particular the
impact on quality of life (qol) are today critical for decision
making in the clinic.
in the atac trial, using the validated instrument functional assessment of cancer therapy – breast plus endocrine subscale (fact-b + es) and despite different toxicity
proﬁles recorded at 5 years median follow-up, no difference
between anastrozole and tamoxifen were observed in terms
of trial outcome index (toi) and its physical and functional
components (cella et al 2006). however, after an initial
worsening of the toi at 3 months follow-up, both treatments
showed, compared to baseline, improvements in qol over
the rest of the 5-year period.
the impact on qol of letrozole compared with placebo
after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen was evaluated in the
ma.17 trial, using the validated short form 36-item health
survey (sf-36) and menopause speciﬁc quality of life
(menqol) questionnaires (whelan et al 2005). published
quality-of-life analysis for this study found no global differences between treatment groups in mean change scores
from baseline for the sf-36 physical and mental component
summary scores. on the response analysis, a signiﬁcant difference in favor of placebo was seen between groups for the
bodily pain domain (p = 0.009) and the vasomotor domain
(p = 0.001) (whelan et al 2005).
exemestane was assessed, compared to tamoxifen, in the
ies with the fact-b instrument (fallowﬁeld et al 2006).
there was no signiﬁcant difference between the two treatment drugs in terms of toi and its physical and functional
components over a period of 2 years. additionally, the mean
endocrine subscale scores increased compared to baseline for
both exemestane and tamoxifen.

clinical issues from long-term
toxicity profiles of ais
third-generation ais have produced signiﬁcant improvements in the treatment of early breast cancer for postmenopausal women. these agents have shown superiority over
tamoxifen in both the initial adjuvant and switch settings
and have induced improved outcome compared to placebo
in the extended hormone therapy setting beyond 5 years of

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(1)

tamoxifen. despite no head-to-head trials comparing ais
in adjuvant setting, efﬁcacy data for these agents may be
relatively comparable in the different settings in which they
were studied. however, in terms of safety proﬁles, results of
adjuvant studies suggest that there may be some differences
between these agents, conﬁrming that today ais should not
be considered interchangeable in clinical practice (winer
et al 2005).
the full deﬁnition of long-term safety proﬁles for ais
is related to the maturity of available safety data. the situation is presently improving with reports on anastrozole at 68
months median follow-up and recent publications on letrozole and exemestane with, respectively, median follow-ups
of 51 and 55 months. however, full safety data are required
for all three agents over the full 5-year adjuvant treatment
period before being able to fully determine their respective
risk:beneﬁt ratios.
with this goal in mind, 2 global risk-beneﬁt indices
were calculated for anastrozole in the atac trial, using
the ‘completion of treatment’ analysis data (atac trialists’ group 2006). the ﬁrst index is the validated global
index of the women’s health initiative (gi-whi) based
upon time to randomization to the earliest occurrence of
breast cancer events, death, coronary heart disease, stroke,
pulmonary embolism, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, and hip fracture. results showed that patients treated
with anastrozole had a lower incidence of events compared
to those on tamoxifen (24% vs 27%, hr0.85, 95% ci:
0.77–0.94, p = 0.0014). the second indice is the global
index of disease-free survival and serious adverse events
(gi-dfs-sae) constructed on the following events: time to
recurrence, death, or any serious adverse events observed in
the ‘completion of treatment’ 68 months median follow-up
analysis of the atac study. the global index showed 1453
events (46%) for anastrozole and 1594 (51%) for tamoxifen (hr0.88, 95% ci: 0.82–0.94, p = 0.0004). cumulative
occurrence of events over time conﬁrmed, for both indexes,
a signiﬁcant difference in favor of anastrozole appearing
early, highest during the ﬁrst 2 years of therapy and carried over the full 5 years of treatment (atac trialists’
group 2006).
updated data are needed from the big 1-98 with a full 5
years exposure to letrozole in order to fully evaluate its riskbeneﬁt ratio compared to tamoxifen in the adjuvant upfront
endocrine therapy. while the duration of patient exposure
to exemestane was limited to 2–3 years in the ies, it is
difﬁcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions on the long term toxicity
proﬁle of exemestane. in this regard, mature results from the

201

nabholtz

presently closed adjuvant team study, comparing 5 years
of exemestane to 5 years of tamoxifen as upfront adjuvant
endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women, are eagerly
awaited.

conclusions
third-generation ais are now part of the armamentarium
of endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with
hormone-sensitive breast cancer. ais results are consistently superior of those of tamoxifen. however, the best
therapeutic strategies for ais in adjuvant setting remain
to be conﬁrmed, in particular in terms of the role of the
sequential approach and the duration of therapy beyond 5
years. while all three ais have class adverse events either
favorable (decreased incidence of hot ﬂushes, gynecologic
and thromboembolic side effects) or unfavorable (skeletal
complications, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, sexual dysfunction), some variability between ais has been reported
in side effects such as lipid changes and cardiac events as
well as gastrointestinal, urogenital, neurologic, and visual
disturbances. all these safety data confirm that today
ais should not be considered interchangeable in clinical
practice. first results of overall therapeutic index of ais
suggest superiority over tamoxifen with proven improved
efﬁcacy and better toxicity proﬁle. since there is no direct
comparison between the three available ais in adjuvant
setting, the decision to use one speciﬁc ai should be based
upon their respective efﬁcacy and toxicity proﬁles, maturity
of data and availability of results within the chosen clinical
strategies.
