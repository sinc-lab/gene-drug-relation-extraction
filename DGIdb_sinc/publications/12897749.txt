blockade of ltc4 synthesis caused by additive inhibition of giv-pla2 phosphorylation: effect of salmeterol and pde4 inhibition in human eosinophils.  prior investigations have demonstrated that beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation is ineffective in inhibiting synthesis of eicosanoids in human eosinophils. this effect has been postulated to relate to density or structural differences in the beta(2)-adrenoceptor or its coupled g-protein. however, recent reports indicate that camp-specific pde4 activity in eosinophils is 10-fold that of other inflammatory cells. we postulated that selective blockade of pde4 in eosinophils would unmask the inhibitory effect of beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation and that this inhibition would result from decreased phosphor-ylation of cytosolic group iv-pla(2) (giv-pla(2)).
