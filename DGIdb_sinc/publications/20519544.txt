general anesthetics cause sedation, hypnosis, and immobilization via cns mechanisms that remain incompletely understood; contributions of particular anesthetic targets in specific neural pathways remain largely unexplored. among potential molecular targets for
mediating anesthetic actions, members of the task subgroup [ xxxg1257xxx  ( xxxg1257xxx ) and  xxxg1258xxx  ( xxxg1258xxx )] of background k ⫹ channels are
appealing candidates since they are expressed in cns sites relevant to anesthetic actions and activated by clinically relevant concentrations of inhaled anesthetics. here, we used global and conditional task channel single and double subunit knock-out mice to demonstrate definitively that task channels account for motoneuronal, anesthetic-activated k ⫹ currents and to test their contributions to
sedative, hypnotic, and immobilizing anesthetic actions. in motoneurons from all knock-out mice lines, task-like currents were reduced
and cells were less sensitive to hyperpolarizing effects of halothane and isoflurane. in an immobilization assay, higher concentrations of
both halothane and isoflurane were required to render task knock-out animals unresponsive to a tail pinch; in assays of sedation (loss
of movement) and hypnosis (loss-of-righting reflex), task knock-out mice showed a modest decrease in sensitivity, and only for
halothane. in conditional knock-out mice, with task channel deletion restricted to cholinergic neurons, immobilizing actions of the
inhaled anesthetics and sedative effects of halothane were reduced to the same extent as in global knock-out lines. these data indicate that
task channels in cholinergic neurons are molecular substrates for select actions of inhaled anesthetics; for immobilization, which is
spinally mediated, these data implicate motoneurons as the likely neuronal substrates.

introduction
the neural mechanisms that mediate important clinical actions
of general anesthetics remain uncertain. a prevailing view holds
that contributions of individual molecular or neuronal targets
depend on the particular anesthetic compound and the specific clinical endpoint examined (for review, see rudolph and
antkowiak, 2004; grasshoff et al., 2005; franks, 2008). this
idea follows from the identification of multiple candidate
molecular targets for different anesthetic compounds and the
realization that various actions (e.g., immobilization vs sedation/hypnosis) engage different brain structures (e.g., spinal
vs supraspinal). it implies that understanding the actions of
any anesthetic drug demands information on how specific
targets within defined neural systems can contribute to each
clinically relevant outcome.
the recent availability of genetically modified mice in which
candidate anesthetic targets have been disrupted has begun to
provide crucial evidence linking drug effects measured on a canreceived march 31, 2010; revised april 20, 2010; accepted april 24, 2010.

didate channel in vitro to behavioral actions of the anesthetic in
vivo. for example, immobilizing and hypnotic actions of intravenous anesthetics were attributed to ␤3-containing gabaa receptors and sedative effects to ␤2-containing receptors (jurd et al.,
2003; reynolds et al., 2003) based on examination of mice expressing anesthetic-insensitive gabaa receptor ␤ subunits. in
addition, the identification of anesthetic-activated, neuronal
background k ⫹ currents (nicoll and madison, 1982; franks and
lieb, 1988) and their subsequent association with specific k2p
subunits (patel et al., 1999) has stimulated production and testing of mice with deletions of the cognate channel genes. a role for
 xxxg1256xxx  ( xxxg1256xxx ) was supported by diminished sensitivity of
global knock-out mice to immobilizing and hypnotic effects of
various inhalational anesthetics (heurteaux et al., 2004). likewise, in mice deleted for either  xxxg1257xxx  or  xxxg1258xxx , immobilization required significantly higher concentrations of halothane
(but not isoflurane), whereas a shift in hypnotic sensitivity was
reported only for isoflurane in  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺ mice and for halothane in  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺ mice (linden et al., 2006, 2007; pang et al.,
2009). the reason for agent-specific differences in anesthetic sensitivity observed in global task knock-out mice is not immediately apparent, and the consequences of deleting both task
channel subunits simultaneously was not examined. moreover,
because experiments were performed in mouse models in which
channel function was disrupted in all cells, differences in behavioral sensitivity could not be assigned to anesthetic modulation of
the channels in any particular group of neurons. in fact, a direct
demonstration that task channels mediate anesthetic-activated

7692 • j. neurosci., june 2, 2010 • 30(22):7691–7704

currents in any specific neuronal population implicated in these
anesthetic actions is currently lacking.
in this work, we used single and double task subunit knockout mice to demonstrate directly that  xxxg1257xxx  and/or  xxxg1258xxx 
subunits account for anesthetic-activated background k ⫹ currents in motoneurons (sirois et al., 2000). we further demonstrate that task channels are required for normal sensitivity to
immobilizing effects of halothane and isoflurane and to sedative/
hypnotic effects of halothane. importantly, effects of task channel
deletion on anesthetic-induced immobilization and halothaneevoked sedation were fully recapitulated when task channels
were ablated selectively in cholinergic neurons. thus, task
channel expression in cholinergic neurons, perhaps those in pontine or forebrain nuclei (talley et al., 2001; karschin et al., 2001),
appears to be necessary for normal halothane-induced sedation.
for anesthetic-induced immobilization, which is mediated spinally and associated with decreased motoneuronal excitability
(kendig, 1993; zhou et al., 1997; 1998; rudolph and antkowiak,
2004), somatic motoneurons represent the most likely relevant
cholinergic cell type.

materials and methods
all animal use was in accordance with guidelines approved by the university of virginia animal care and use committee (charlottesville,
va); experiments were performed on genetically modified male and female mice.
task channel knock-out mice. the derivation of global  xxxg1257xxx  and
 xxxg1258xxx  knock-out mice has been described previously (mulkey et al.,
2007; davies et al., 2008), and selective phenotypic characterization of
these and other task knock-out lines has been presented (linden et al.,
2006, 2007, 2008; meuth et al., 2006; mulkey et al., 2007; davies et al.,
2008; pang et al., 2009). for the current work, individual mouse lines
with “floxed” alleles for  xxxg1257xxx  ( xxxg1257xxx  f/f) and  xxxg1258xxx  ( xxxg1258xxx  f/f)
were moved onto a c57bl/6j background by using “speed congenics”
(university of virginia transgenic core); subsequently, the floxed exon 2
of each gene was excised by crossing with a cre-deleter strain, also on a
c57bl/6j background (eiia-cre; jackson laboratories stock #003724),
and the resulting knock-out lines were intercrossed to generate a double
 xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺: xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺ line (task ⫺/⫺). all knock-out lines were
maintained as homozygotes, with the parental c57bl/6j mouse line used
as a control strain.
to achieve cell-specific deletion of task channels with an emphasis
on motoneurons, we obtained multiple mouse lines in which cre recombinase is expressed in motoneurons and a limited number of other cell
populations. these cre-expressing lines were crossed with our congenic
 xxxg1257xxx  f/f:  xxxg1258xxx  f/f double-floxed lines. for the conditional task
channel knock-out studies reported here, we used mice in which an
internal ribosome entry site (ires)-cre cassette was knocked into the
 xxxg440xxx  locus (chat-cre; the jackson laboratory,
stock #006410); in this line, cre expression is directed selectively to
cholinergic neurons, including motoneurons. for various reasons (see
below), other mouse lines that were expected to support selective cremediated recombination in motoneurons were not effective for our purposes; these included another chat-cre line (gensat, gm53) (gong
et al., 2007), isl1-cre (srinivas et al., 2001) (received from dr. j.-p. liu,
university of virginia), olig1-cre, and olig2-cre (lu et al., 2002) [received from dr. c. d. stiles (harvard university, cambridge, ma) and
d. h. rowitch (university of california, san francisco, ca)].
for all global and conditional knock-out lines, a multiplex pcr
was performed with tail dna to verify the presence of floxed or deleted
task channel alleles ( xxxg1257xxx  primers: gaagcccctgcaggcaac, gctcaggctggggcttttg, ggtctgactctgcttggc;
 xxxg1258xxx  primers: gacctaactcctctcttcttcc, caacacacctgcacacagaag, gcaccccaaaatgcttcagc). to identify
cre-expressing mice, a separate pcr was performed using primers
targeting the cre coding region (gcacgttcaccggcatcaac,
cgatgcaacgagtgatgaggttc).

in situ hybridization histochemistry. nonisotopic in situ hybridization
was performed using digoxigenin-labeled crna probes, essentially as
described previously (berg and bayliss, 2007). in brief, mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde and brain sections (30
␮m) were cut on a vibratome, rinsed in sterile pbs, and placed free
floating into prehybridization mixture (0.6 m nacl, 0.1 m tris-cl, ph 7.5,
0.002 m edta, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mg/ml yeast total
rna, 0.05 mg/ml yeast trna, 1⫻ denhardt’s bsa, 50% formamide,
10%  xxxd1860xxx , 0.05 mg/ml oligo(da), 10 ␮m four deoxynucleoside
triphosphates, 0.5 mg/ml herring sperm dna, and 10 mm dtt) at room
temperature for 30 min and then at 37°c for 1 h. mouse  xxxg1257xxx  and
 xxxg1258xxx  (in pcdna3) were linearized with spe1 and stu1, respectively,
to yield templates that encompass only the second (i.e., the deleted) exon
of each gene (mulkey et al., 2007; davies et al., 2008). in vitro transcription was performed on linearized templates using digoxigenin-11-utp
(boehringer mannheim); digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were purified
on probequant g-50 microcolumns (ge healthcare) and added to the
prehybridization solution. sections were incubated at 55– 60°c for
16 –20 h, rinsed through decreasing concentrations of salt solutions,
treated with  xxxg1963xxx  at 37°c, and then subjected to a final highstringency wash (0.1⫻ ssc at 55°c for 60 min; 1⫻ ssc: 150 mm nacl
and 15 mm sodium citrate, ph 7). sections were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:1000;
boehringer mannheim), and the alkaline phosphatase was reacted with
nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate,
4-toluidine salt in colorization buffer (50 mm mgcl2, 100 mm tris, ph
9.5, 100 mm nacl) while protected from light. the reaction was
quenched by rinsing in te buffer (10 mm tris, 1 mm edta, ph 8.5); the
sections were mounted onto gelatin-subbed slides and coverslipped, and
images were obtained on a zeiss axioskop 2 using a pixelfly camera and
iplab software.
chat and  xxxg1258xxx  double-labeling immunohistochemistry. perfusionfixed brain sections (30 ␮m) were obtained as described above and
washed extensively in pbs and 100 mm tris-buffered saline (ts) solutions, blocked for 1 h in 10% horse serum/0.1% triton x-100/ts, and
then incubated overnight at 4°c with goat anti-chat (1:1000; millipore
bioscience research reagents) and rabbit anti- xxxg1258xxx  (1:1000) (berg et
al., 2004; berg and bayliss, 2007). for detection, sections were incubated
(1 h) with cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat antisera (1:1000; jackson
immunoresearch laboratories ) and alexa fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antisera (1:2000; invitrogen). sections were mounted
onto gelatin-subbed slides and coverslipped and images were obtained
on a zeiss axioskop 2 epifluorescent microscope with appropriate filter
sets using a pixelfly camera and iplab software.
brain slices. the preparation of brain slices has been described in detail
previously (sirois et al., 1998, 2000). briefly, neonatal mouse pups of
either sex (6 –12 d postnatal) were deeply anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine: 200/14 mg/kg, i.m.) and decapitated, and transverse brainstem
slices were prepared (300 ␮m) using a microslicer (dsk 1500e,
dosaka) in ice-cold sucrose (260 mm)-substituted ringer’s solution
(aghajanian and rasmussen, 1989) containing kynurenate (1 mm).
slices were incubated for 30 min at 37°c and then at room temperature in normal ringer’s solution containing the following (in mm):
130 nacl, 3 kcl, 2 mgcl2, 2 cacl2, 1.25 nah2po4, 26 nahco3, and
10 glucose; both substituted and normal ringer’s solutions were bubbled with 95% o2/5% co2.
electrophysiology. for electrophysiological recording of motoneurons,
mouse brainstem slices were transferred to a chamber on the stage of a
zeiss axioskop and visualized with infrared differential interference contrast optics; hypoglossal motoneurons were identified by their anatomic
location and their characteristic size and shape. all recordings were performed at room temperature in hepes-based bath solutions containing
the following (in mm): 140 nacl, 3 kcl, 10 hepes, 2 cacl2, 2 mgcl2, and
10 glucose. recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries to a dc resistance ranging from 3 to 5 m⍀ and coated with sylgard
184 (dow corning). for voltage-clamp recordings of task-like currents, pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 120 kch3so3, 4
nacl, 1 mgcl2, 0.5 cacl2, 10 hepes, 10 egta, 3 mgatp, 0.3 gtp-tris,
ph 7.2; we also included 50 ␮m zd7288 (tocris cookson) to block ph-

and anesthetic-sensitive ih in motoneurons. for current-clamp recordings, pipette solutions contained the following (in mm): 17.5 kcl, 122.5
potassium gluconate, 10 hepes, 0.2 egta, 9 nacl, 1 mgcl2, 3 mgatp,
3, 0.3 gtp-tris, ph 7.2. we routinely added 0.5 ␮m tetrodotoxin (ttx;
alomone labs) to the bath solution to block action potentials and, where
noted, a bicuculline/strychnine mixture ( xxxd1891xxx  and 30 ␮m; sigma) was
added to block gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  channels. halothane and
isoflurane were bubbled into bath solutions through calibrated vaporizers (ohmeda, ge healthcare); aqueous concentrations were determined
by gas chromatography from samples collected at the point of solution
entry into the recording chamber (sirois et al., 1998; 2000).
data acquisition and analysis. voltage commands were applied and
currents recorded using pclamp software interfaced with an axopatch
200b amplifier via a digidata 1322a digitizer (all from molecular devices). series resistance was compensated by 60 –75% and continuously
monitored to ensure stability of recordings and adequate compensation.
resting membrane potential was determined directly under current
clamp or calculated from the zero current potential under voltage clamp.
for voltage-clamp recordings, cells were held at ⫺60 mv and a series of
hyperpolarizing voltage steps (⌬ ⫺10 mv, to ⫺130 mv) or a hyperpolarizing ramp voltage was applied (0.2 v/s, from ⫺60 mv to ⫺130 mv);
input conductance was determined from linear analysis of the resultant
current–voltage (i–v) relationships around the resting membrane potential (⫺60 mv to ⫺90 mv). the characteristics of ph- and anestheticsensitive currents were obtained by digital subtraction of i–v curves in
alkalized and acidified baths and in the presence and absence of inhaled
anesthetics; i–v curves were fitted with the goldman–hodgkin–katz
(ghk) current equation of the following form:

analysis of anesthetic action in mice. mice were tested for sensitivity to
hypnotic effects of halothane and isoflurane by using the loss-of-righting
reflex (lorr) assay. mice were placed in a sealed plastic container
through which a constant flow of anesthetic:oxygen gas mixture was
delivered via a calibrated vaporizer and oxygen flow meter; anesthetic
concentration in the chamber was continuously monitored using a calibrated infrared analyzer (capnomac, datex, ge healthcare). after an
extensive equilibration period at each anesthetic concentration (halothane: 40 min; isoflurane: 30 min), mice were tested for their ability to
maintain upright posture (quinlan et al., 1998). immobilization was
assessed by using a mac assay, where mac is the minimum alveolar
concentration of anesthetic at which 50% of animals fail to respond to a
painful stimulus (tail clamp) delivered at supramaximal intensity; animals were considered unresponsive only if there is no obvious major
muscular movement in direct response to the tail clamp (eger et al.,
1965). halothane and isoflurane (in oxygen) were delivered via a vaporizer to mice placed in a nose cone, with concentrations continuously
monitored at the nose cone (capnomac, ge healthcare). rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 36 –38°c using a heating pad.
after the 30 – 40 min equilibration periods at each anesthetic concentration, the tail was clamped for up to 45 s using hemostats; anesthetic
concentration was increased stepwise (⌬ ⫹0.1%) until the animal failed
to respond to the tail clamp. although animals were exposed to anesthetics for 2–3 h in these assays, mac values are known to be stable for ⬎8 h
(eger et al., 1965). for a measure of sedation, we incorporated an infrared
mouse motion detector/data logger (mouse-e-motion, infra-e-motion)
onto a flow-through veterinary anesthesia chamber (surgivet). the data
logging system was set to detect movements of mice placed in this covered chamber on a second-to-second basis, and those values were
summed over 5–10 min epochs for a control period (duration: 10 min)
and then during exposure to anesthetic:oxygen gas mixture; data thus
represent the total number of seconds in an epoch when any movement
took place. anesthetic concentration in the chamber was continuously
monitored (capnomac, ge healthcare).

as a control for effects of task channel deletion on the anesthetic
actions of inhalational agents, we also examined effects of etomidate, an
intravenous anesthetic that has no effect on task channels. bolus injections of etomidate (10 mg/kg) were administered via the tail vein, and
latencies to regain the righting reflex and the paw withdrawal reflex were
used as a measure of sensitivity to hypnotic and immobilizing actions,
respectively (garfield and bukusoglu, 1996).
data acquisition and analysis. results are presented as mean ⫾ sem.
data were analyzed statistically using one-way anova or student’s t
test; post hoc pairwise comparisons used bonferroni’s correction of the t
test. we obtained ec50 values for anesthetic action by averaging the
anesthetic concentration at which the reflex was lost in individual animals or from a logistic fit through grouped data (in excel or prism 3.0);
the values obtained from these two methods were not different. in all
cases, differences in mean values were considered significant if p ⬍ 0.05.

results
we previously described the derivation of global task channel
knock-out mice on a mixed genetic background (mulkey et al.,
2007; davies et al., 2008); for the present work, we primarily used
homozygous task knock-out mouse lines that were maintained
on a c57bl/6j background, with wild-type c57bl/6j mice serving as the control strain. we confirmed a number of cellular and
behavioral effects of anesthetics in mice on both the c57bl/6j
and mixed genetic background. in addition, we generated a new
conditional knock-out line in which task channel deletion was
restricted to cholinergic neurons. for all mouse lines, we verified loss of task expression, examined anesthetic-sensitive
membrane properties in motoneurons, and determined the
consequences of task channel deletion on clinically relevant
anesthetic outcomes.
as with the lines described earlier (mulkey et al., 2007), congenic task channel knock-out mice were viable and displayed
no obvious sensorimotor deficits (data not shown). as expected
based on earlier work from previously described task knockout lines (aller et al., 2005; brickley et al., 2007; mulkey et al.,
2007), we found no evidence for altered expression of other k2p
channel genes in a microarray analysis of brainstem cdna from
either single or double congenic task channel knock-out mice
(data not shown). moreover, a directed quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis revealed no difference in expression of the
anesthetic-sensitive  xxxg1256xxx  ( xxxg1256xxx ) channel in brainstem of
double task knock-out mice (supplemental fig. s1, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
task channel deletion and diminished task-like currents in
motoneurons from task knock-out mice
task channel expression in motoneurons from congenic task
knock-out lines was examined histochemically by nonisotopic in
situ hybridization and functionally by whole-cell, patch-clamp
electrophysiology. as shown in figure 1, strong expression of
both  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  subunits was observed in all pools of
motoneurons examined in control c57bl/6j mice (i.e., facial,
hypoglossal, spinal) (talley et al., 2000; 2001; karschin et al.,
2001; berg et al., 2004); as expected, hybridization signal for the
relevant task channel subunit was diminished in single task
knock-out mice, and there was no detectable expression of either
subunit in motoneurons from double task ⫺/⫺ mice. likewise,
task expression was lost in other brain regions of knock-out
mice where  xxxg1257xxx ,  xxxg1258xxx , or both are typically expressed
(e.g., locus ceruleus, dorsal raphe, striatum; data not shown)
(mulkey et al., 2007).
we performed whole-cell recordings from hypoglossal motoneurons in brainstem slices obtained from control and task

channel knock-out mice. as shown in figure 2 a, we found that motoneurons from
single and double task subunit knockout mice appeared to have normal firing
properties; in response to depolarizing
current pulses, cells from control and
task knock-out mice were able to fire
overshooting action potentials repetitively, with fast and medium afterhyperpolarizations that are typical of these
neurons. however, as shown in figure 2b
(left), motoneurons from task knockout mice were significantly depolarized in
comparison to cells from control mice;

in hypoglossal motoneurons from the
rat, essentially all of the standing outward
current sensitive to ph variations (from
ph 8.4 to ph 5.9) appears to be due to
task channels insofar as the instantaneous i–v relationships of ph-sensitive
currents are well fitted by the ghk equation, with a reversal potential at the potassium equilibrium potential (ek) (talley et
al., 2000). this was not the case in mouse
hypoglossal motoneurons, where multiple channels appear to contribute to the
overall ph-sensitive current; this is most
easily discerned by the lack of a clear
reversal in instantaneous i–vs of ph-sensitive current from mouse motoneurons
(fig. 2c, left). nevertheless, a contribution of task channels was clearly evident figure 1. task channel subunits are deleted from motoneurons in task knockout mice. in situ hybridization was performed using

figure 3. anesthetic-sensitive currents in motoneurons from task knock-out mice. a, representative time series of holding current (ihold; at ⫺60 mv) in individual motoneurons from wild-type
(i) and task knock-out (ii–iv) mice during exposure to acidified (ph 5.9) and alkalized (ph 8.4) bath solutions, the inhalational anesthetic halothane (0.8 mm), and a discriminating concentration
of zn 2⫹ (100 ␮m). b, the halothane-activated current was derived in motoneurons from wild-type (wt) and task knock-out lines (t1ko,  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺; t3ko,  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺; t-ko, task ⫺/⫺) by
digital subtraction of control currents from those measured in the presence of halothane; those values were averaged (⫾sem) and plotted over a range of membrane potentials. the data from
wild-type and single subunit task knock-out mice were fitted with the ghk equation. c, likewise, the current activated by isoflurane was derived in motoneurons by digital subtraction of control
currents from those measured in the presence of 0.5 mm isoflurane, averaged (⫾sem), plotted versus membrane potential, and fitted with ghk equations.

the observation that this current displays instantaneous ghk
rectification and inhibition by extracellular acidification, hallmark properties of task channels (sirois et al., 2000; berg et
al., 2004). thus, we tested here whether wild-type mouse
motoneurons also express a task-like, anesthetic-activated
background k ⫹ current, and we used our knock-out mice to
determine whether such a current can be attributed to task
channels.
as depicted in figure 3a for a representative wild-type motoneuron, bath acidification (from ph 7.3 to ph 5.9) decreased
outward holding current at ⫺60 mv and bath alkalization (to ph
8.4) increased outward current; in the alkalized bath, administration of the inhalational anesthetic halothane (0.8 mm) further
increased the outward current. the ph- and halothane-sensitive
current in this cell was partially inhibited by 100 ␮m zn 2⫹ and
totally eliminated by a second bout of bath acidification. the
voltage-dependent properties of the halothane-sensitive current
were characterized by digital subtraction of instantaneous i–v
curves in the presence and absence of halothane (i.e., the i–v at
ph 8.4 was subtracted from the i–v in halothane at ph 8.4); as
shown in figure 3b, the averaged i–v relationship for this
halothane-activated current was well fitted by the ghk equation
in wild-type mouse motoneurons (n ⫽ 13). these results are
similar to those we reported earlier in rat motoneurons (sirois et
al., 2000; berg et al., 2004).
as described above, the ph-sensitive current was strongly diminished in motoneurons from either  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺ or  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 2); the lower three records of figure 3a show that
the halothane-activated current was also reduced in these cells.
the residual halothane-activated outward current was mediated
by the remaining homomeric task channels in motoneurons
from single task subunit knock-out mice, since the averaged
i–v values of halothane-sensitive current were well fitted by a

ghk equation (fig. 3b) and halothane failed to evoke an outward current in double task ⫺/⫺ knock-out mice. in fact, halothane induced a consistent, albeit small, inward shift in holding
current in motoneurons from double task ⫺/⫺ knock-out mice.
the averaged halothane-activated current in motoneurons from
each of the knock-out lines was significantly reduced (fig. 3b) in
comparison to that from wild-type mice (halothane-activated
current at ⫺60 mv: control, 249.1 ⫾ 29.5 pa;  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺,
52.6 ⫾ 8.3 pa;  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, 94.2 ⫾ 19.8 pa; task ⫺/⫺, ⫺27.4 ⫾
5.4 pa; n ⱖ 8, p ⬍ 0.05).
we obtained essentially identical results with 0.5 mm isoflurane, a different class of inhalational anesthetic (fig. 3c). the
averaged current amplitude was slightly smaller for isoflurane
than for halothane in wild-type motoneurons, but the differences
between wild-type and knock-out lines were highly significant
(isoflurane-activated current at ⫺60 mv: control, 161.7 ⫾ 43.1
pa;  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺, 28.2 ⫾ 4.7 pa;  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, 62.3 ⫾ 10.7 pa;
task ⫺/⫺, ⫺42.3 ⫾ 13.4 pa; n ⱖ 6, p ⬍ 0.05). it is important to
mention that we previously reported that isoflurane differentially modulates rat task (rtask) channel clones expressed
heterologously, with rtask-1 less sensitive to isoflurane than
rtask-3 (berg et al., 2004). however, we found here that
isoflurane is able to activate the mouse  xxxg1257xxx  channel (supplemental fig. s2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), accounting for the ability of isoflurane to
enhance current in  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺ mice, where only homomeric
 xxxg1257xxx  channels should persist.
thus, these data indicate that the k ⫹ current activated by
inhalational anesthetics in mouse motoneurons is indeed due to
task channels; they also predict that anesthetic-induced
changes in excitability that are mediated by task channels will
be absent in task knock-out mice.

reduced anesthetic-evoked membrane hyperpolarization in
task knock-out mice
we performed current-clamp analysis of motoneuronal responses to anesthetics in the absence of blockers of other
anesthetic-sensitive channels (e.g., gabaa, hcn) to assess overall effects of the drugs on membrane potential. as shown in
figure 4a, halothane (0.8 mm) caused a strong membrane hyperpolarization in a representative motoneuron from a wild-type
mouse (approximately ⫺12 mv); halothane evoked smaller hyperpolarizations in motoneurons from  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺ mice (approximately ⫺4 to ⫺5 mv) and actually caused a
slight depolarization in the cell from a double task ⫺/⫺ knockout mice (⬃3 mv). averaged data reveal significantly different
effects on membrane potential between wild-type and task
knock-out lines for halothane (fig. 4b) (control, ⫺8.0 ⫾ 1.1 mv;
 xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺, ⫺2.5 ⫾ 0.3 mv;  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, ⫺3.0 ⫾ 0.6 mv;

0.6 mv; n ⱖ 6, p ⬍ 0.05). these current-clamp results are entirely
consistent with voltage-clamp data where anesthetics activated
smaller outward currents in single task subunit knock-out mice
and an inward current shift in double task ⫺/⫺ knock-out
mice. note also that a bicuculline/strychnine mixture applied
during anesthetic administration had essentially no effect on
membrane potential in motoneurons, regardless of task
genotype (fig. 4 a).
anesthetic-induced immobilization and halothane-evoked
sedation and hypnosis are reduced in task knock-out mice
we examined effects of task channel deletion on three key features of anesthetic action—immobilization, hypnosis, and sedation— using behavioral assays in mice. for immobilization and
hypnosis, respectively, we determined the anesthetic concentration at which half the animals failed to respond to a tail or paw
pinch (mac) or failed to right themselves when placed on their
backs (mac-awake, lorr); for sedation, we adapted an infrared

motion detector system to record effects of anesthetic exposure
on overall activity.
for all task channel knock-out lines, whether single subunit
deletion or double task ⫺/⫺ knock-outs, a significantly higher
concentration of halothane or isoflurane was required to render
mice unresponsive to a tail pinch in comparison with wildtype mice (fig. 5a); anesthetic sensitivity was not different
when compared across the task knock-out lines. the insets
in figure 5a plot averaged values of mac obtained for each of
the genotypes (halothane: c57bl/6j, 0.97 ⫾ 0.01;  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺, 1.10 ⫾ 0.03;  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, 1.16 ⫾ 0.02; task ⫺/⫺, 1.13 ⫾

0.02; task ⫺/⫺, 1.43 ⫾ 0.02; n ⱖ 10, f(3,60) ⫽ 6.7, p ⬍ 0.001).
thus, sensitivity to immobilizing actions of both anesthetics
was reduced by task channel deletion.
compared with wild-type mice, a higher concentration of
halothane was required to interfere with the righting reflex for all
lines of task knock-out mice (fig. 5b); among the different
task knock-out lines, however, there was no difference in ec50
values (halothane: c57bl/6j, 0.70 ⫾ 0.01;  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺, 0.84 ⫾
0.01;  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, 0.83 ⫾ 0.01; task ⫺/⫺, 0.81 ⫾ 0.02; n ⱖ 6, p ⬍
0.05). by contrast, the lorr induced by isoflurane occurred at
the same concentration in all mouse lines (isoflurane: c57bl/6j,
0.81 ⫾ 0.01;  xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺, 0.86 ⫾ 0.01;  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, 0.85 ⫾ 0.01;
task ⫺/⫺, 0.82 ⫾ 0.02; n ⱖ 18). these data indicate that there is
no effect of task channel deletion on isoflurane-induced hypnosis, but a slight decrease in hypnotic sensitivity to halothane in
task knock-out mice.
we also found that task knock-out mice were less sensitive
to sedating actions of halothane. as shown in figure 5c, we
tracked movements as a function of time for mice exposed to
0.6% halothane and 0.7% halothane; whereas wild-type mice
were sedated by ⬃15–20 min into the 0.6% halothane exposure,
task knock-out mice remained active throughout much of the
40 min of exposure to 0.6% halothane and only reached the same
low level of activity after ⬃10 min. of exposure to 0.7% halothane

lazarenko et al. • task knock-out decreases anesthetic sensitivity

(fig. 5c, left). the striking difference in
sedative actions of halothane is even more
apparent in the time integral of these data
(i.e., the total movement time) (fig. 5c,
right); by this measure, all task knockout lines were equally resistant to the sedative actions of halothane. the difference
in activity was caused by the anesthetic
and was not a reflection of some other effect of task channel deletion on overall
activity levels; wild-type and task
knock-out mice had essentially identical
activity levels during the initial control period, and although activity decreased
somewhat over the same time period in
control experiments without exposure
to halothane, the levels were not different across genotypes (fig. 5c, left, filled
symbols). interestingly, mirroring the
agent-specific actions of halothane and
isoflurane on hypnosis, we found no significant difference in effects of isoflurane
on task knock-out mice in this same assay (data not shown). thus, hypnotic and
sedative actions of halothane, but not
isoflurane, appear to be blunted in task
knock-out mice; on the other hand, the
sensitivity to immobilizing actions of both
drugs is reduced in task knock-out lines.
for all assays, there were no differences in
relative anesthetic sensitivity between single subunit task knock-outs and double
task ⫺/⫺ mice.

that task channels are indeed molecular

halothane and for immobilizing effects of
both halothane and isoflurane. however,

discussion
in this work, we used multiple lines of
knock-out mice to demonstrate directly
that task channels account for a prominent motoneuronal ph-sensitive background k ⫹ current that is activated by
halothane and isoflurane. in addition, we
showed that deletion of  xxxg1257xxx  and/or
 xxxg1258xxx  in global knock-out mice is associated with decreased sensitivity to immobilizing actions of both those anesthetic
compounds. a reduction in hypnotic and
sedative effects of halothane, but not
isoflurane, also reliably accompanied
task channel ablation. there were no
differences in immobilizing or hypnotic

thane; immobilizing actions of isoflurane occurred at the same
concentration in both  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  knock-outs (linden
et al., 2006; 2007). the reason for those earlier reports of agentselective effects on immobilization in task knock-out mice are
not clear since, unlike rat  xxxg1257xxx  (berg et al., 2004), we find that
isoflurane can activate the mouse variant of  xxxg1257xxx , and our
motoneuronal recordings demonstrate a decrease in both
halothane- and isoflurane-activated currents in all task knockout mice. thus, our behavioral data are in line with in vitro observations in that we find decreased sensitivity to immobilizing
effects of both halothane and isoflurane in all three task knockout lines ( xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺,  xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺, and task ⫺/⫺), whether on
a congenic c57bl/6j or a mixed genetic background.
it is important to point out that task channel deletion did
not eliminate the immobilizing actions of either anesthetic
(linden et al., 2006; 2007); although the dose–response curve was
shifted to the right, all animals still became immobilized at high
anesthetic concentrations. these residual effects were seen even
in double task knock-outs and must reflect actions on other
anesthetic targets. one such molecular target may be the
anesthetic-activated  xxxg1256xxx  channels (patel et al., 1999); a rightward shift in mac sensitivity was observed in mice deleted for
 xxxg1256xxx  (heurteaux et al., 2004), possibly reflecting removal of
an “excitability brake” provided by  xxxg1256xxx  channels in sensory
nociceptors (alloui et al., 2006). it is also interesting that task
knock-out mice have increased sensitivity to gabaa ligands
(linden et al., 2008), and because gabaa receptors are well known
anesthetic targets (rudolph and antkowiak, 2004; grasshoff et al.,
2005; franks, 2008), enhanced effects of anesthetics on gabaa
receptors could compensate for the loss of task channels in
behavioral assays of anesthetic sensitivity. if this is the case, it
likely involves neuronal targets other than motoneurons, since
we observed only small gabaa-mediated anesthetic effects in
motoneurons, with no differences between wild-type and task
knock-out mice.
motoneurons are the most likely site for task channel
contributions to anesthetic-induced immobilization
our previous work with motoneurons (sirois et al., 1998, 2000),
coupled with the obvious contributions of those cells to motor
reflexes, led us to focus on this cell group as a possible site of
action for immobilizing anesthetic actions mediated by task
channels. to examine this, we used chat-driven cre expression
to limit task gene excision to cholinergic neurons, including
motoneurons. deletion of task channels in those specific cell
groups fully recapitulated effects on immobilization of a complete task knock-out. the obvious shortcoming in this particular mouse model is that motoneurons are not the only
cholinergic neurons that express task channels (talley et al.,
2001; karschin et al., 2001; berg and bayliss, 2007). unfortunately, task gene deletion was not sufficiently restricted or penetrant in four additional lines of mice expected to produce a more
motoneuron-selective cre expression pattern. in any case, although our use of the chat-cre mice does not allow us to formally rule out a contribution from other groups of cholinergic
neurons (e.g., striatal interneurons, basal forebrain cell groups,
sympathetic preganglionic neurons), we do not favor a role for
these other cell groups since either they are not present in the
spinal cord, where anesthetic-induced immobilization is mediated (kendig, 1993; rudolph and antkowiak, 2004), or they have
no obvious link to motor reflex action.
there was not a strict correlation between effects of task
channel deletion on motoneuronal currents in vitro and anes-

thetic sensitivity in vivo. specifically, we found similar shifts in
mac with single subunit and double task ⫺/⫺ knock-out mice
even though cellular responses to anesthetics were more strongly
diminished in double task ⫺/⫺ mice. we suggest that this reflects a limit to the contribution of motoneuronal task channels
to the overall behavioral response and a role for other anesthetic
targets in determining anesthetic sensitivity. this view is supported by previous observations that  xxxg1256xxx  channels also make
a contribution to immobilization by various inhalational anesthetics; for halothane, the effect of  xxxg1256xxx  deletion on mac was
even greater than we found here for task deletion (from 0.89 to
1.32%) (heurteaux et al., 2004). it is also consistent with the
observation that immobilization is ultimately obtained in task
knock-out mice, even if at a higher anesthetic concentration.
motoneuronal background k ⴙ current is mediated by
task channels
our previous work in rat motoneurons implicated task channels based on shared properties of the native motoneuronal
current and recombinant task currents (i.e., similar voltagedependent and kinetic properties) (sirois et al., 2000; 2002; talley
et al., 2000; berg et al., 2004). although attribution of native
currents to task channels based on such shared properties has
been validated in knock-out mice for a number of other central
neurons (e.g., raphe, cerebellar granule, thalamocortical) (aller
et al., 2005; meuth et al., 2006; brickley et al., 2007; mulkey et al.,
2007), that was not the case for glucose-activated k ⫹ currents
initially identified as task-like in orexin neurons (burdakov et
al., 2006; gonzalez et al., 2009; guyon et al., 2009). in this work,
we demonstrate unequivocally that task channels are responsible for the ph- and anesthetic-sensitive background k ⫹ current
in mouse motoneurons. it is also worth noting that our earlier
work suggested a substantial component of motoneuronal
task-like current is due to heteromeric channels (berg et al.,
2004), a result supported here by the finding that the combined
decrease in task-like current in motoneurons with deletion of
 xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  individually was ⬎100% of the total task
current defined by deletion of both subunits simultaneously.
combined with elegant single channel work (kang et al., 2004;
kim et al., 2009) and evidence from other task knock-out
mice (aller et al., 2005), it seems clear that heteromeric conformations of  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  should be anticipated in
sites of coexpression.
task channels contribute to sedative and hypnotic effects
of halothane
we found a consistent difference in hypnotic and sedative effects
of halothane, but not isoflurane, in single subunit and double
 xxxg1257xxx  ⫺/⫺: xxxg1258xxx  ⫺/⫺ knock-out mice whether we examined
mouse strains on a c57bl/6j or on a mixed genetic background.
these data do not agree with results reported for a different
mixed genetic line of  xxxg1257xxx  knock-out mice, for which hypnotic sensitivity to isoflurane was slightly diminished but halothane sensitivity was unchanged (linden et al., 2006). the
reasons for opposite results from these two independently generated lines of  xxxg1257xxx  knock-out mice remain unclear. however,
similar to our results, a more recent paper with a  xxxg1258xxx  knockout mouse line reported a decrease in sensitivity to hypnotic effects of halothane as well as altered sleep structure (pang et al.,
2009). interestingly, a prominent difference in  xxxg1258xxx  knockouts was a slower transition from wake to sleep periods (pang et
al., 2009) that is reminiscent of the delayed halothane-induced
sedation we observed in task knock-out mice. in that other

lazarenko et al. • task knock-out decreases anesthetic sensitivity

work, disrupted halothane-activated theta rhythms were implicated and, because theta activation was sensitive to atropine, disruption of anesthetic action was proposed to involve task
channel interactions with cholinergic signaling (pang et al.,
2009). in this respect, it is intriguing that we found diminished
sensitivity to sedating actions of halothane in mice with task
channel deletion restricted to cholinergic neurons. since hypnotic sensitivity was unaffected in the conditional knock-outs, it
appears that task contributions to halothane-induced hypnosis
involve noncholinergic task-expressing cell neurons (e.g.,
aminergic, thalamocortical) (sirois et al., 2000; washburn et al.,
2002; meuth et al., 2003; 2006).
in conclusion, this work provides strong evidence that task
channel activation in motoneurons contributes to immobilizing
effects of inhaled anesthetics; insofar as the drugs remained capable of causing immobility in these knock-out mice, albeit at
higher concentrations, the work also supports the idea that additional molecular and neuronal targets contribute to this important anesthetic action. similar studies with new cell type-specific
knock-out or knock-in mouse models will be required to validate
other candidate anesthetic targets and localize their central sites
of action.
