abstract
using a combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and inverse-pcr techniques, we amplified, cloned and
sequenced a full-length porcine 5-hydroxytryptamine 1f ( xxxg1112xxx ) receptor complementary dna (cdna) derived from porcine trigeminal
ganglion. sequence analysis revealed 1101 base pairs (bp) encoding an open reading frame of 366 amino acids showing a high similarity
(>90%) with the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor sequences from other species, including human. the recombinant porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor was expressed in
african green monkey kidney cell lines (cos-7 cells) and its ligand binding profile was determined using [3h]5-ht. the affinities of several
agonists (ly334370 (5-(4-fluorobenzoyl)amino-3-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-1h-indole fumarate)>cp122638 (n-methyl-3 [pyrrolidin 2(r)-yl

correlated highly with those described for the recombinant human  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (spearman correlation coefficient; rs = 0.942). nevertheless,
as compared to the human homologue, some triptans (i.e. sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx ) displayed a 10- to 15-fold lower affinity for
the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor. using rt-pcr technique, the expression of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna was observed in cerebral cortex,
trigeminal ganglion and several blood vessels, but not in skeletal muscles. in conclusion, we have cloned and established the amino acid
sequence and ligand binding profile of the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor as well as the distribution of its mrna. this information may be helpful in
exploring the role of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor in physiological processes and diseases, such as migraine. d 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the physiological actions of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) are mediated by multiple types of serotonin
receptors and the characterisation (molecular, pharmacological and operational) of these receptors helps to recognise
their importance as therapeutic targets (hoyer et al., 1994;
saxena, 1995; barnes and sharp, 1999). since the acute
 xxxd2022xxx  agents (ergot alkaloids and triptans) display
high affinity at 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors, it
became apparent that these receptors may be important
targets for  xxxd2022xxx  drugs (adham et al., 1993; leysen

et al., 1996; johnson et al., 1997; saxena and tfelt-hansen,
2000). an important feature of these  xxxd2022xxx  drugs is
cranial vasoconstriction, which is mediated by the 5-ht1b,
rather than the  xxxg1110xxx  or  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (de vries et al.,
1999; razzaque et al., 1999; bouchelet et al., 2000). on the
other hand,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors have been shown to
be primarily involved in  xxxd3263xxx -induced inhibition of neurogenic dural plasma protein extravasation (humphrey, 1991;
moskowitz, 1992; phebus et al., 1997; goadsby, 1999). the
presence of  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors has been shown in
the trigeminal ganglion (bruinvels et al., 1994; waeber and
moskowitz, 1995) and that agonists at these receptors, for
example pnu109291 ([(s)-(-)-1-[2-[4-(4-methoxyphenyl)1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-methyl-isochroman-6-carboxamide])
and ly344864 ([(r)-(+)-n-[3-(n,n-dimethylamino)1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazol-6-yl]-4-fluoro-benzamide]),

respectively, inhibit neurogenic dural inflammation (johnson et al., 1997; phebus et al., 1997; ennis et al., 1998).
moreover, some recent reports also showed the role of 5ht1f receptor in modulating c-fos protein expression and
glutamate release in trigeminal ganglion and trigeminal
nucleus caudalis in rats (mitsikostas et al., 1999; ma,
2001). even though a direct role of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor in
vasoconstriction has recently been ruled out (razzaque et
al., 1999; villalón et al., 1999; bouchelet et al., 2000), it is
conceivable that the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor may indirectly affect
vasomotor activity via the trigeminovascular system.
recently, we have cloned and sequenced the recombinant
porcine 5-ht1b (bhalla et al., 2001) and  xxxg1110xxx  (bhalla et
al., 2000) receptors, which possess a pharmacological profile
very similar to those described for their human homologues.
a notable exception, however, was brl15572, a selective
antagonist at the human  xxxg1110xxx  (price et al., 1997);
brl15572 poorly recognised the recombinant porcine  xxxg1110xxx  receptor (bhalla et al., 2000). in the present study, we
have cloned, sequenced the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (p5-ht1f;
r.c.: 2.1.5ht.01f) and studied its ligand-binding profile and
tissue distribution.

2. methods
2.1. pcr amplification and cloning of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
complementary dna (cdna)
porcine specific  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna was amplified
using a combination of reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr) and inverse-pcr techniques; for
details see bhalla et al. (2000, 2001). cdna was synthesised
from rna, extracted from trigeminal ganglia, obtained
from a pig (yorkshire  landrace, female, 12 kg). the
quality of rna and cdna preparations was checked by
pcr amplification of b-actin (ponte et al., 1984).
as depicted in fig. 1, a pcr product containing a partial
sequence of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna was amplified
using a forward (5v-atggatttcttaaactcatct-3v,
nucleotides 1 – 21) and a reverse (5v-ctaatatcga
catcgtacaag-3; nucleotides 1081– 1101) oligonucleotide primers (fig. 1a, a and b), designed on the basis of
consensus sequence of  xxxg1112xxx  receptors from other species
(amlaiky et al., 1992; adham et al., 1993, 1997; lovenberg
et al., 1993). the amplified pcr products were separated on
1% agarose gel in tbe (100 mm tris, 90 mm boric acid
and 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)) buffer
containing ethidium bromide, visualised under uv light and
photographed. the purified pcr products were then ligated
into the pgemt-easy vector and transformed into competent jm109 cells. four insert positive clones were processed
for isolation of the plasmid dna and sequencing.
since the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers
used in rt-pcr for amplification were based on a consensus
sequence derived from other species, we identified the 5v and

of the full-length porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor and the positions of various
primers used for pcr amplification. (a) unknown full-length porcine 5ht1f receptor cdna with 5v (a) and 3v (b) end primers designed from
known sequence from other species. (b) the amplified full-length product
containing a partial sequence of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor and the 5v and 3v
end sequences derived from other species (hatched rectangles). the partial
sequence of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor was used to design porcine-specific
inverse primers (c) and (d). (c) the inverse-pcr amplified partial genomic
sequence was used to design porcine specific primers (e) and (f ) for
amplifying the full-length porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna. (d) the fulllength amplified product of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna.

3v ends of recombinant porcine cdna by inverse-pcr
(ochman et al., 1988). porcine genomic dna was digested
with bamh1 restriction enzyme, as the cloned  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna did not show any restriction site for bamh1. after
purification, the restricted dna was ligated overnight at 16
c in the presence of t4-dna ligase in order to obtain dna
circles. using inverse primers based on the derived porcine
cdna sequence (5v-gcagctttcgggtcacaataa3vfor 5v end and 5v-ttgccaaggaggaactgaatg3v for 3v end; fig. 1b, c and d), the ligated dna fragments
were subjected to pcr amplification. the pcr products
were separated on a 1% agarose gel, purified, cloned and
sequenced. finally, porcine specific forward (5v-atggatttctcaaactcatct-3v) and reverse (5v-ctaacaccgacacatcgcaca-3v) oligonucleotide primers,
designed from the sequences generated from inverse-pcr
(fig. 1c, e and f), were used to amplify the full-length  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor cdna from the porcine trigeminal ganglion (fig.
1d).
the full-length cdna sequence of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor was derived from at least two independent pcr amplified products and further verified by multiple partial
sequences derived from genomic dna amplified products
(inverse-pcr). in sporadic cases showing nucleotide discrepancy in the sequence, the nucleotide having a clear
majority in clones was preferred for establishing the final
full-length cdna sequence, using the dnaman sequence
analysis program (version 3.2, lynnon biosoft# 1994–
1997). the final sequence was translated as a peptide

sequence and compared with those in the genbank (blast
search at national centre for biotechnology information,
bethesda, md, usa; web site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/blast/). the hydrophobic regions indicating putative
transmembrane domains and sequence homology with
known  xxxg1112xxx  receptors from other species were established.
2.2. transient transfection and radioligand binding assay
the purified full-length pig  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna insert
was subcloned into dephosphorylated eukaryotic expression
vector, pcdna3 (invitrogen, san diego, ca, usa). monkey cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with the
recombinant plasmid and membranes were prepared for
radioligand binding assays using 8.0 nm [3h]5-ht (pauwels
et al., 1996). incubation mixtures consisted of 0.40 ml of cell
membrane preparation (30 – 50 mg of protein), 0.05 ml of

25

[3h]5-ht and 0.05 ml of compounds for inhibition or 10 mm
5-ht to determine non-specific binding. the reaction was
terminated by filtration over a whatman gf/b glass-fibre
filter with ice-cold tris-buffer and the radioactivity on the
filter paper was measured by using a liquid scintillation
counter. data were analysed graphically with inhibition
curves and ic50 values were derived. binding affinity constants (ki values) were calculated according to the equation
ki = ic50/(1 + c/kd), where c is the concentration and kd is
the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand.
radioligand saturation binding curves were analysed by a
non-linear least square curve-fitting programme to determine
equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and maximum binding site density (bmax) values (munson and rodbard, 1980).
control binding experiments were run with non-transfected
cos-7 cells and they did not display detectable specific
[3h]5-ht binding.

2.3. rt-pcr for  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna detection
the expression of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna was studied by
rt-pcr technique in a number of porcine tissues (brain
cortex, cerebellum, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscles,
saphenous vein and mesenteric, coronary and pulmonary
arteries) obtained from four pigs previously used in acute
haemodynamic experiments, as described in detail earlier
(bhalla et al., 2001). the purified total rna samples from
the tissues were reverse transcribed into cdna in the
absence (control reaction to monitor dna contamination)
or the presence of reverse transcriptase enzyme. porcine

nucleotides 410 – 429 base pairs (bp)) and antisense (5vgctttgcgttctcttgtgcc-3v, nucleotides 853 –
872bp) primers were used for the amplification of partial
porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna. the pcr amplified products
were separated on 2% agarose gel by electrophoretic separation, stained with ethidium bromide, visualised under uv
light and photographed.

2.4. materials
all oligonucleotide primers were commercially procured
from life technologies (breda, the netherlands). various
chemicals used in this study were of molecular biology and/

pcr prep and mini-prep dna purification systems were
purchased from promega benelux (leiden, the netherlands). oligotex mrna purification kit was purchased from
qiagen (hilden, germany). amplitaqgold and dye terminator/cycle sequencing ready reaction kit were procured

3. results
3.1. cloning of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna derived from
trigeminal ganglion
using rt-pcr technique, the trigeminal ganglion cdna
yielded a full-length clone of approximately 1150 bp containing a partial sequence of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (see
fig. 1b). the nucleotide sequence showed a high homology
with  xxxg1112xxx  receptors from other species (data not shown).
on the basis of this sequence, porcine specific inverse

primers were designed and used on porcine genomic dna
circles to establish the sequence of 5v and 3v ends of the
porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor by inverse-pcr (fig. 1c). a pcr
product of approximately 1200 bp was amplified, cloned
and sequenced. whereas sequence analysis revealed a single
mismatch in the 5v end and three mismatches in the 3v end
of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor, there were no differences in the rest of
the sequence derived from the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
cdna and genomic dna (fig. 2).

the full-length porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna was finally
amplified by using cdna templates derived from poly(a + )
mrna of porcine trigeminal ganglion and porcine specific
5v end (sense) and 3v end (antisense) primers (fig. 1d) and
agarose gel electrophoresis of rt-pcr products is shown in
fig. 3. the amplification of the porcine b-actin cdna
(approximately 625 bp) ensured that the quality of cdna
samples was adequate for the amplification of other products, while any genomic contamination was ruled out by the

biosoft#) predicted a typical g-protein receptor structure with seven transmembrane domains i – vii (underlined) as well as putative n-glycosylation, protein

absence of any band in the rna samples lacking reverse
transcriptase. the trigeminal ganglion cdna showed a pcr
product band of approximately 1150 bp, which was cloned
into pgemt-easy vector and sequenced. when the
recombinant plasmid was checked by restriction analysis,
it yielded a full-length cloned product with not1, whereas

with ecori used on the basis of a single restriction site in 5ht1f receptors of other species (amlaiky et al., 1992; adham
et al., 1993, 1997; lovenberg et al., 1993), resulted into two
bands of 800 and 300 bp.
sequencing of the recombinant plasmid revealed an open
reading frame of 1101 bp (fig. 4). dnaman analysis

showed that this full-length porcine cdna encoded a 366
amino acid protein (calculated molecular weight: 41.8 kda)
exhibiting the features of a typical g-protein-coupled receptor with predicted seven transmembrane domains and putative n-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites (fig. 4). a
blast search of the nucleotide sequence at genbank
revealed a high resemblance with the sequence of  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors from other species. in fig. 5, the amino acid
sequence of the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor has been compared
with those of the human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan,
guinea pig, mouse and rat. across the species, there was a
90% (rat) to 93% (human) similarity in the overall sequence.
nevertheless, it may be noted that the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
contains several amino acids that are unique: ser4,11, tyr8,
ala22 (n-terminal extracellular region), phe28, ile29 (first
transmembrane domain), gln133 (second intracellular loop),
thr195 (fifth transmembrane domain), ser238, arg239,276
(third intracellular loop) and met345 (seventh transmembrane
domain). further, it may be noted that pro244 (third intracellular loop) and thr333 (seventh transmembrane domain)
were present only in pig and orang-utan (fig. 5).

unpublished) as well as human (wurch et al., 1998 and
unpublished) or porcine (bhalla et al., 2000, 2001) 5-ht1b
and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors. the affinity constants at the porcine
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor showed the highest correlation with those at
the human  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (rs = 0.944; b = 0.815). in contrast, the correlation at the porcine or human 5-ht1b
(rs = 0.287 and 0.329, respectively) and  xxxg1110xxx  (rs = 0.424
and 0.318, respectively) receptors was much weaker. however, it may be noted that, except dihydroergotamine, all
compounds and, in particular, sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and
 xxxd3135xxx , displayed 10- to 15-times less affinity at the
porcine than at the human  xxxg1112xxx  receptors (see table 1).
3.3. expression of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna in porcine tissues
based on the recombinant porcine specific  xxxg1112xxx  receptor sequence, two internal primers were designed and used
on cdna templates prepared from several porcine tissues.
as shown in fig. 7, a single band of pcr amplified product
(approximately 460 bp) representing the presence of  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor mrna was clearly detected in the brain cortex,
trigeminal ganglion and saphenous vein. moderate signals

3.2. ligand binding profile of recombinant porcine  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor
saturation binding studies and scatchard analysis, performed over 10 concentrations of 5-ht, demonstrated that
membranes obtained from monkey cos-7 cells transiently
transfected with the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor showed a single
population of high affinity binding sites for [3h]5-ht. the
equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and maximum receptor density (b max ) for [ 3 h]5-ht were, respectively,
20.8 f 1.9 nm and 7.12 f 1.85 pmol mg 1 of protein
(n = 3 each). no detectable specific [3h]5-ht binding was
observed in nontransfected cell membranes.
the affinity constants (pki values) of 22 serotonergic
compounds (15 putative agonists and 7 putative antagonists)
for the displacement of [3h]5-ht from membranes obtained
from cos-7 cells expressing porcine (present results) and
human (pauwels et al., 1997; john et al., 1999 and pauwels,
unpublished)  xxxg1112xxx  receptor are shown in table 1. among
the compounds tested, the potent and selective  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonist ly334370 (phebus et al., 1997) showed
the highest affinity. the rank order of affinity of the putative
agonists was ly334370>cp122638 = naratriptan = 5ht> xxxd1976xxx >sumatriptan>frovatriptan = avitriptan>dihydroergotamine> xxxd3562xxx >5-carboxamidotryptamine> xxxd3135xxx >alniditan = donitriptan>l694247, while that of
putative antagonists was methiothepin>gr127935>ritanserin> sb224289>brl15572> xxxd2419xxx  =  xxxd2957xxx .
in fig. 6, pki values of the above compounds obtained in
the present experiments with membranes from cells expressing the cloned pig  xxxg1112xxx  receptor have been plotted against
pki values obtained earlier with the same compounds using
membranes from cells expressing the cloned human  xxxg1112xxx 
(pauwels et al., 1997; john et al., 1999 and pauwels,

fig. 6. regression analysis of binding affinity constants (pki values) of 5-ht receptor ligands at the cloned porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (see table 1) with those
reported with cloned  xxxg1112xxx  (human; top panel), 5-ht1b (pig and human; middle panels) and  xxxg1110xxx  (pig and human; lower panels) receptors, using [3h]5-ht
( xxxg1112xxx ) and [3h]gr125743 (5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx ) as ligands (for references, see text). please note that values for some compounds were not available for all
receptors. the spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and the corresponding values of the slope (b), calculated with slidewrite plus for windows# (advanced
graphics software, encinitas, ca, usa), are listed in each panel. the compounds included in the graphs are (1) ly334370, (2) cp122638, (3) naratriptan, (4)
5-ht, (5)  xxxd1976xxx , (6) sumatriptan, (7) dihydroergotamine, (8) frovatriptan, (9) avitriptan, (10)  xxxd3562xxx , (11) 5-carboxamidotryptamine, (12)  xxxd3135xxx ,

were observed in the coronary and pulmonary artery, while
only weak or no signals were noticed in the cerebellum,
mesenteric artery and skeletal muscles. the possibility of
genomic dna and/or pcr contamination was ruled out on

the basis of the absence of any band in negative controls
(autoclaved water and brain cortex rna in the absence of
reverse transcription).

4. discussion
4.1. cloning and sequence analysis

fig. 7. agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr amplified products derived from
cdna obtained from a number of porcine tissue samples. the size of
marker bands is indicated in the left margin. rt, reverse transcriptase
enzyme.

specific primer sequences of the full-length porcine 5ht1f receptor were identified by inverse-pcr on genomic
dna and used for amplification of full-length  xxxg1112xxx  receptor cdna prepared from the porcine trigeminal ganglion.
the nucleotide sequence of 1101 bp dna fragment
revealed an open reading frame of 366 amino acid protein
of the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor displaying a high homology
(90 –93%) with the human and several other mammalian
species. the computer analysis predicted seven transmembrane domains as well as putative n-glycosylation and
phosphorylation sites, similar to those observed in other
species (amlaiky et al., 1992; adham et al., 1993, 1997;
lovenberg et al., 1993).

p. bhalla et al. / european journal of pharmacology 436 (2002) 23–33

a comparison of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor amino acid
sequence with previously characterised recombinant porcine
5-ht1b (bhalla et al., 2001) and  xxxg1110xxx  (bhalla et al., 2000)
receptors showed 48% and 49% homology, respectively.
moreover, analogous to porcine 5-ht1b (ala4, ser15,21 and
arg19) and  xxxg1110xxx  (val8,36, asp10, gly14, thr15, lys27,
pro97 and glu102) receptors, the porcine 5ht1f receptor also
showed some unique amino acids (ser4,11,238, tyr8, phe28,
ile29, gln133, thr195, arg239,276, met345) as compared to
other species. interestingly, pro244 and thr333 were common
to the pig and orang-utan 5ht1f receptor. the encoding
divergent amino acids at the n- (ser4,11, tyr8, phe28, ile29)
and c- (ser238, arg239,276, met345) terminals were also
verified when the genomic dna was used for inverse-pcr
(see fig. 2), thus ruling out the possibility of sequencing
error.
4.2. ligand binding profile
using [3h]5-ht as a radioligand, membranes from cos-7
cells expressing the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor showed a kd
value of 20.8 f 1.9 nm, which agreed with the ki value of
5-ht (17.4 f 5.3 nm; table 1). the present kd value is
somewhat higher than that obtained with the human  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor (kd: 9.2 f 0.99 nm, adham et al., 1993), but is not
dissimilar to that obtained with the guinea pig  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor (kd: 14 f 3 nm, adham et al., 1997). although
in both cases [3h]5-ht was used as radioligand, the guinea
pig receptor was expressed, as in the present investigation,
in cos-7 cells, whereas the human receptor was expressed in
lm(tk ) cells.
overall, the pharmacological profile of the porcine  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor was similar to that of the human homologue and the
affinity constants of serotonergic drugs at the two  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors showed a very high correlation (table 1 and fig.
6). also, ly334370 and cp122638, which are reasonably
selective at the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (waeber and moskowitz,
1995; wainscott et al., 1998), were the two compounds with
the highest affinities at the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor. however, it should be pointed out that generally the compounds
investigated showed a lower affinity at the porcine compared to the human receptor (table 1). this was most
marked for sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx , which
had over 10-fold lower affinity at the porcine receptor. the
lower affinity at the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor may be due to a
single or multiple amino acid differences in its transmembrane domains. indeed, as pointed out above, several amino
acids in the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor are unique (phe28 and
ile29 in the first, thr195 in the fifth and met345 in the seventh
transmembrane domain). in any case,  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonism is not a requirement for  xxxd2022xxx  efficacy (dahlöf
and saxena, 2000), since alniditan and  xxxd3135xxx , which do
not have a particularly high affinity at the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
(table 1), effectively abort migraine attacks (adelman et al.,
2001; diener et al., 2001). moreover, it is still unclear if the
efficacy of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist ly33470 in migraine

31

(goldstein et al., 2001) is due to a selective action on this
receptor (dahlöf and saxena, 2000).
interestingly, like  xxxg1110xxx  (thr342) (weinshank et al.,
1992; harwood et al., 1995; wurch et al., 1997) and nonrodent 5-ht1b (thr355) (adham et al., 1994) receptors, the
porcine (and orang-utan)  xxxg1112xxx  receptor has a polar threonine amino acid at the homologous position within the
seventh transmembrane domain (thr333) (see fig. 5). this
is strikingly different from the human, guinea pig, mouse
and rat  xxxg1112xxx  receptors, which all have a non-polar alanine
residue (ala333) (amlaiky et al., 1992; adham et al., 1993,
1997; lovenberg et al., 1993) or from the rat and mouse 5ht1b receptors, which have a polar asparagine residue
(asn355) (oksenberg et al., 1992). it is known that a single
point mutation of either threonine (5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and 5ht1e) or alanine ( xxxg1112xxx ) to asparagine considerably increases
the affinity of these human receptors for b-adrenoceptors
antagonists (oksenberg et al., 1992; adham et al., 1994).
the presence of thr333 in the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor is in
agreement with its low affinity for the b-adrenoceptor
antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  (ki: >10,000 nm; table 1). however,
despite thr333, the ligand binding profile of the porcine 5ht1f receptor resembles that of the human  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
having an ala333 and not that of the 5-ht1b (thr355) or  xxxg1110xxx  (thr342) receptors. whether or not thr333 in the
porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor is responsible for the lower affinity
of these drugs will be worth investigating.
4.3. tissue distribution of mrna
expression of mrna for  xxxg1112xxx  receptor in the porcine
trigeminal ganglion supports the possible central role of
these receptors in inhibiting dural plasma protein extravasation (johnson et al., 1997; phebus et al., 1997), presumably by a presynaptic action. furthermore, since the mrna
signals were found in other brain tissues (cortex, cerebellum), the  xxxg1112xxx  receptors may function as auto- and/or
heteroreceptor (hoyer et al., 1994; barnes and sharp, 1999).
interestingly, despite the presence of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
mrna in some blood vessels (nilsson et al., 1999; bouchelet et al., 2000 and present results), it is practically ruled
out that this receptor mediates vasoconstriction (shepheard
et al., 1999; bouchelet et al., 2000; cohen and schenck,
2000). in the case of porcine coronary artery, the mrna
signals of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor were detected. earlier reports in
the human coronary artery, also employing the rt-pcr
technique, have either denied (ishida et al., 1999) or
advocated (nilsson et al., 1999) the presence of  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor mrna. even though, we do not have a clear
explanation for the presence of mrna signals in vascular
beds, it may be that these receptors mediate some other
(patho)physiological responses, for example plasma protein
extravasation or mitosis leading to vascular remodelling.
in conclusion, we have cloned the porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
cdna from the trigeminal ganglion by rt-pcr technique.
the ligand binding profile of porcine  xxxg1112xxx  receptor was

32

p. bhalla et al. / european journal of pharmacology 436 (2002) 23–33

consistent with the human  xxxg1112xxx  receptor, although some
triptans exhibited a conspicuously lower affinity for the
porcine receptor. this information may be helpful in exploring the role of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor in physiological processes and
diseases, such as migraine.
