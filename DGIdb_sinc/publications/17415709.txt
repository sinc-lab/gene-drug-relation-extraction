 xxxg380xxx , a coinhibitory molecule, plays a role in immune escape of
tumors. we have shown previously the expression of this molecule
in breast cancer patients and demonstrated its association with
high histological grade, progesterone and  xxxg730xxx  negative status, all of which are known to have direct impact on cell
proliferation. in the present work, we investigated the effect of
proliferation, as measured by ki-67 and mitotic count, on the
induction of  xxxg380xxx . we used h&e stained sections to score for
mitotic count in 69 breast cancer patients. immunohistochemistry
was used to investigate  xxxg380xxx  and ki-67 expression. the relationship between  xxxg380xxx  induction and cell proliferation was further
investigated in primary cultured cells.  xxxg380xxx  expression was
recorded in patients with a high mitotic index (p 5 0.007). there
was a high signiﬁcant correlation between  xxxg380xxx  expression and
the presence of the proliferative marker ki-67 (p < 0.001) indicating the association of proliferation with  xxxg380xxx  induction. furthermore,  xxxg380xxx  was gradually induced in proliferating cells of 8/8
primary cell lines as measured by ki-67 expression. finally,  xxxg380xxx  was downregulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in cells
stimulated with a mitogen conﬁrming the association of proliferation with the induction of  xxxg380xxx . we have shown for the ﬁrst time
a direct association between proliferation and the expression of
 xxxg380xxx  in breast cancer patients. the relationship between  xxxg380xxx 
induction and cell proliferation was also thoroughly investigated
in vitro, in which a strong link between  xxxg380xxx  expression and the
presence of the proliferative ki-67 marker was clearly demonstrated.

about 40% of women still die of breast cancer in spite of the
signiﬁcant advances in traditional, targeted and neo-adjuvant
therapies.1 immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at manipulating
the patient’s immune system to speciﬁcally destroy tumor cells
may represent a major alternative approach for the management
of cancer.2,3 however, the presence of an existing immune tolerance in patients with advanced cancer may limit the clinical effectiveness of such therapeutic strategies.4 several mechanisms have
been attributed to the immune defect seen in breast cancer patients
with advanced disease; where a lower number of blood lymphocytes,5 elevated t regulatory lymphocytes,6 defective dendritic
cells7 and expression of fasl in breast cancer8 were described.
a t lymphocyte inhibitory molecule named  xxxg380xxx  (also called
 xxxg380xxx ) expressed by antigen presenting cells has been shown to
induce t lymphocyte anergy and/or apoptosis after ligation to its
t lymphocytes receptor  xxxg1688xxx .9–12 it has been shown to be directly
involved in the protection of cancer cells from activated t
lymphocytes.13 the expression of this molecule has been described
in several malignancies including ovary, colon, melanoma and
carcinoma of the lung.11 others includes; squamous cell carcinoma
of head and neck,14 gliomas,15 nonsmall cell lung carcinoma,16
esophageal carcinoma,17 renal cell carcinomas,18 where a strong
link between its expression by the cancer cells and the patient clinpublication of the international union against cancer

icopathological status has been demonstrated in some of these
malignancies.16–18 we have recently demonstrated the expression
of  xxxg380xxx  in 50% of patients with inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma of
the breast.19 our ﬁndings indicated that  xxxg380xxx  correlates with
important prognostic factors linked to high-risk patients. the
expression of  xxxg380xxx  was signiﬁcantly associated with a large
histological grade iii (p 5 0.012), negative  xxxg730xxx  (er)
(p 5 0.036) and negative  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) (p 5 0.040).
histological grade of breast tumors combines the details of cell
morphology (nuclear pleomorphism), measurement of differentiation (tubular differentiation) and cellular proliferation (mitotic
index).20 moreover, breast epitheliums that have er and pr negative status exert a high proliferative frequency in comparison with
receptors-positive counterparts.21,22 we have asked in the present
work whether breast cancer cells having high proliferative index
are the ones expressing the  xxxg380xxx  molecule and if this, alone or
in combination, will inﬂuence the histological grade, er and pr
status.
several approaches have been developed to study tumor proliferation including; labeling index, s-phase fraction (spf)
measurement, cytosolic tk assay and ki-67 marker.23 the ki-67
molecule is the most widely used marker for proliferation in
clinical practice.23 it is expressed exclusively in all active phases
of cell cycle and absent in quiescent cells.24 in normal breast,
ki-67 is expressed at very low levels (<3% of cells), whereas in
cancer cells it is expressed at relatively higher levels (from 0
to above than 50%)25 making this marker an excellent tool for
estimating the growth fraction of cancer cells.
in the present study, we investigated the effect of proliferation,
as measured by ki-67 and mitotic count, on the induction of  xxxg380xxx  in breast cancer patients. we further investigated the relationship between  xxxg380xxx  induction and cell proliferation in primary
cultured cells. finally, we provide clear evidence to the association of  xxxg380xxx  expression in tumor cells and cellular proliferation.

(breast conservative surgery or total mastectomy) at king faisal
specialist hospital and research center from 2003 to 2006.
signed informed consent was obtained from all the patients.
following tumor excision, an anatomical pathologist grossly
examined and obtained a representative piece of the tumor tissue
denoted t, and an adjacent normal breast tissue from the same
affected breast; denoted n. normal breast tissues were also
obtained from 2 healthy women undergoing plastic surgery and
designated as bp.
a fraction of all tissues were ﬁxed in formalin and embedded in
parafﬁn for routine histopathological analysis. another fraction,
with an average diameter of 0.5–1 cm, were immersed in cell
culture medium with 10% fetal calf serum and kept at 4°c until
further processing before culture. the rest were prepared for
embedment in optimal cutting temperature (oct) compound
(miles laboratories, elkhart, in), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and preserved at 280°c until processed. frozen blocks were
sectioned 4–6 lm using cryostat (shandon, pittsburgh, pa) and
adhered to superfrost slides (fisherbrand, pittsburgh, pa). after
overnight drying the sections were ﬁxed for 10–20 min in acetone,
wrapped in aluminum foil and then stored at 280°c until the day
of immunostaining.
generation of primary cell lines
tissues obtained from breast cancer patients and new born
baby foreskin were placed in dmem medium (sigma, saint
louis, mo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs)
(cambrex, rockland, me) and kept at 4°c until processed.
tissue were cut into smaller pieces (1–2 mm diameter), placed
in digestion solution (400 iu collagenase, 100 iu hyaluridinase
and 10% serum, all from sigma, saint louis, mo), containing
antibiotics and antimycotics solution (gibco, grand island,
ny) and incubated at 37°c for 6 hr to overnight in an adams
nutator mixer (becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj). the
cells were separated by differential centrifugation at 90g for 2
min. the epithelial cells in the pellet were cultured at 37°c,
5% co2 in 75 cm2 t-ﬂask containing 12 ml of epithelial cell
growth medium composed of medium 199 and ham’s f12
media mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10 lg/ml insulin,
5 lg/ml transferrin, 250 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 6.1 lg/ml
ethanolamine, 14.1 lg/ml o-phosphoethanolamine, 8.8 lg/ml
 xxxd124xxx , 10 ng/ml  xxxg681xxx  (egf),
40 lg/ml fetuin, 100 lg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx  (all from
sigma, saint louis, mo) and 20 mg bovine pitutiary extract
(gibco, grand island, ny). the supernatant containing ﬁbroblasts were centrifuged at 485g for 8 min, resuspended in
ﬁbroblasts growth medium (medium 199 and ham’s f12
mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10–20% fcs) and cultured
at 37°c, 5% co2. skin epithelial cells (keratinocytes) were
cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (k-sfm) (gibco,
grand island, ny).
inhibition and stimulation of cell proliferation assays
it is known that nontransformed (primary) cells can become
quiescent (g0 phase) after serum withdrawal or contact inhibition.26 to measure  xxxg380xxx  level in g0 phase arrested cells,
a foreskin ﬁbroblast cell line (70% conﬂuence) expressing
100%  xxxg380xxx  molecules was cultured for 3–4 days to reach
100% conﬂuence. medium containing 0.5% serum was replaced in cultured cells and left for 2 extra days before  xxxg380xxx  staining. nonarrested proliferating cells in the exponential
phase of cell growth cultured at 20% conﬂuence were used as
a control (stained for  xxxg380xxx  expression after reaching 50%
conﬂuence).
to stimulate cell proliferation, a slow-growing ﬁbroblast cell
line expressing 50% of  xxxg380xxx  molecule was cultured in the presence of egf as a strong mitogen.  xxxg380xxx  was analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry before and after stimulation.

cell cycle
to study the cell cycle, primary foreskin ﬁbroblasts were cultured in ﬁbroblasts growth medium in tissue culture ﬂasks to reach
80–90% conﬂuence (synchronization). cell cycle was investigated
at different time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 36 hr). at each
time point cells were trypsinized, washed in pbs and either ﬁxed
in 80% methanol for cell cycle analysis or stained for  xxxg380xxx  by
facs.
flow cytometry and facs analysis
cells were stained for 60 min on ice with an anti- xxxg380xxx  pe-labeled antibody (ebioscience, san diego, ca). after antibody
staining, cells were washed twice with cold pbs containing 2%
fetal bovine serum, suspended in 300 ll pbs and analyzed using
facs scan (becton-dickinson, immunocytometry systems, san
jose, ca). for cell cycle analysis, cells were suspended in 1 ml
hypotonic staining buffer (0.25 g sodium citrate, 0.75 ml triton3 100, 0.025 g  xxxd3027xxx , 0.005 g  xxxg1963xxx , 250 ml
dho2) and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature
(rt). cell ﬂuorescence was measured using a width-pulse area
signal to discriminate between g2/m cells and cell doublets gating
out the latter. data were analyzed by facs scan using a dna
content frequency deconvolution software.
immunohistochemistry staining of frozen tissue sections
immunohistochemistry for both single and double staining was
carried out as described previously.19 for single staining, the sections were incubated for 15 min in 0.3%  xxxd2298xxx  and 0.1% sodium azide (sigma, saint louis, mo) to block
the activity of endogenous peroxidase. after 2 washes in pbs, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum (dako, denmark) for
30 min followed by the addition of a primary antibody. for  xxxg380xxx 
staining, cells were incubated overnight at 4°c with the  xxxg380xxx 
antibody (mih1 clone, ebioscience, san diego, ca) diluted at
1:50 dilution. for the ki-67 staining, cells were incubated for 1 hr
at rt with ki-67 antibody (ki-67 clone, dako, denmark) diluted
at 1:50 dilution. after washing 3 times in pbs, sections were
stained for 30 min at rt, with labeled polymer (envision1)
horseradish peroxidase (hrp) detection kit (dako, denmark).
after washing 3 times with pbs, red color was developed using
the chromogen 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole (sigma, saint louis,
mo) and the sections were counterstained for 1 min with instant
hematoxylin (shandon, pittsburgh, pa).
for double staining, sections were washed in pbs and blocked
in  xxxd2298xxx  and goat serum as described earlier. the 2
primary antibodies, anti- xxxg380xxx  (mih1 clone, ebioscience, san
diego, ca) at 1:50 dilution and rabbit anti-ki-67 (vectorlabs,
burlingame, ca) at 1:1000 dilution, were added together in 10%
human ab serum (cambrex) and incubated for 2 hr at rt. the
sections were washed 3 times in pbs and incubated for 30 min at
rt with the 2 secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse igg1 linked
to alkaline phosphatase (ap) (southernbiotech, birmingham, al)
diluted at 1:50 and swine anti-rabbit igg linked to hrp (dako,
denmark) diluted at 1:50. after washing 3 times with pbs, substrates were added starting with fast red (dako, denmark) followed with dab (novocastra, newcastle upon tyne, uk) after in
between pbs washing. the slides were counterstained with instant
hematoxylin (shandon, pittsburgh, pa) for 15 sec.
immunocytometry of cell cytospin
cultured cells were attached to superfrost/plus glass slides
(shandon, pittsburgh, pa) using cytofunnels (shandon) with
centrifugation at 800 rpm for 3 min in a cytospin 2 (shandon).
slides were dried overnight, acetone ﬁxed for 15 min and stored
at 280°c until stained. for staining, the cell membrane was
permeablized with 0.5% triton-x (j.t. chemical, phillipsburg,
nj) for 1.5 hr in the presence of 10% goat serum as a blocker.

routine parafﬁn-embedded sections
samples were evaluated by routine immunohistochemistry
method on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded breast cancer tissues
for erand pr status. the er and the pr were stained with the relevant speciﬁc antibodies (novocastra).
immunohistochemistry scoring
the percentages of tumor cells stained positive for  xxxg380xxx 
was quantiﬁed at 5–10 increments by an anatomical pathologist
and the growth fraction of ki-67 was determined by another pathologist without prior knowledge of patient details. ki-67 score
was counted on a minimum of 5 randomly selected 403 high
power ﬁelds containing representative sections of tumor and
calculated as the percentage of positively stained cells to total
cells.
histological grade evaluation
histological grade of breast cancer sections was evaluated
according to scarff-bloom-richardson (sbr) classiﬁcations.27
statistical analysis
statistical analyses were used to determine the association
between the  xxxg380xxx  expression, and ki-67 and other related

patient’s clinicopathological parameters. relationships were
assessed using pearson chi-square (x2) test. the signiﬁcance level
was taken to be 0.05, and all p-values were two-sided. the software package sas 9.1 (sas institute, cary, nc) was used for
these analyses.

results
expression of  xxxg380xxx  correlates with er negative, pr negative
status and high mitotic count
in a previous study we have shown a correlation between  xxxg380xxx  expression and er, pr negative status and high histological
grade in 44 breast cancer patients.19 we extended our study to
include 69 patients and observed very similar patterns of expressions [i.e., er negative status (p 5 0.039), pr negative status (p
5 0.041) and high histological grade (sbr) (p 5 0.050)] (table
i). in invasive breast carcinomas sbr is the average of 3 known
components (tubular differentiation, nuclear pleomorphism and
mitotic index) used to assess the histological grade status of
patients. we independently subjected the 3 sbr components
against  xxxg380xxx  to investigate which component is most contribut-

ing to  xxxg380xxx  expression. a signiﬁcant correlation was recorded
for both nuclear pleomorphism (p 5 0.034) and mitotic index
(p 5 0.007) with the latter being the most signiﬁcant factor associated with  xxxg380xxx . no signiﬁcant association (p 5 0.088) was
recorded for tubular differentiation (table i). it is known that high
mitotic count is an indication of high proliferative tumor cells and
that er and pr-negative breast epitheliums have a high proliferative index. therefore, we tested whether breast cancer patients
having high mitotic index are associated with pr and er negative
status. signiﬁcant correlation was reordered for both er (p <
0.001) and pr (p 5 0.027) negative patients.
the expression of  xxxg380xxx  in breast cancer patients correlates
with cell proliferation as measured by ki-67 marker
the ki-67 is a well known standard marker to measure cell proliferation and is being used in routine clinical laboratories. tumor
tissues from 69 breast cancer patients were stained for ki-67
expression. nuclear cell staining for this molecule was used to
measure the growth fraction in tumor cells with a cut-off point of
20%. we classiﬁed tumor sections into low (0–19%), moderate
(20–39%) and high (40%) ki-67 expressing tumors. there was a
signiﬁcant correlation between  xxxg380xxx  expression and the presence
ki-67 marker (p < 0.001) as shown by anova (fig. 1a). more
importantly there was a linear correlation between  xxxg380xxx  expression and ki-67 expression (p < 0.001) as shown by linear regression analysis (fig. 1b).
to investigate whether tumor cells expressing the  xxxg380xxx  molecule are coexpressing the ki-67 marker, we double-stained sections for both molecules. interestingly, most tumor cells expressing cytoplasmic/membranous  xxxg380xxx  were also stained for nuclear
ki-67 marker. in addition, a low population of  xxxg380xxx -positive tumor cells was negative for ki-67 marker and vice versa. figure 1c
shows a representative stained section of low, moderate and high
expression of both molecules.
we have also conﬁrmed the association between ki-67 expression and other factors related to mitosis. we have found a
high signiﬁcant correlation between ki-67 expression and er
negative status (p < 0.001), pr negative status (p 5 0.011), sbr
(p < 0.001), nuclear pleomorphism (p < 0.001) and mitotic index
(p < 0.001) (table ii).
 xxxg380xxx  is induced in vitro in primary cultures of ﬁbroblasts
and epithelial cells
the contribution of proliferation to  xxxg380xxx  induction, seen in
breast cancer patients, was further investigated in nontransformed
primary cell culture. we tested whether  xxxg380xxx  is inducible in pro-

liferating cells in vitro. therefore, we obtained human normal
breast tissues from plastic surgery patients, normal and tumor tissues from breast cancer patients, and skin tissues from healthy
foreskin donors. primary ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cell lines were
generated from these tissues and  xxxg380xxx  induction was measured
before and after cell line establishment.  xxxg380xxx  was absent or
expressed at very low levels (<5%) in all breast cells before culture, while foreskin cells showed a 10–20% expression. regardless of the tissue origin,  xxxg380xxx  was induced after the ﬁrst passage
in 60–100% of cultured cells in 8/8 primary cell lines (fig. 2). a
slower cell growth was noticed for cell lines having relatively
lower  xxxg380xxx  expression (n breast ep, t breast q).
 xxxg380xxx  is gradually induced in proliferating cells
to investigate whether  xxxg380xxx  is induced in proliferating cells,
normal breast tissue cells were cultured in vitro and double stained
at different time points (day 1, 2, 5 and 10) for the expression of
both  xxxg380xxx  and ki-67.  xxxg380xxx  was gradually induced in cultured
cells (fig. 3a) and this upregulation was in parallel with ki-67
induction (fig. 3b). both  xxxg380xxx  and ki-67 were induced at low

levels (<5%) from day 1 and reached maximum expression (>90%)
by day 10. however, a strongest intensity of  xxxg380xxx  staining was
observed on day 2 of culture and gradually decreased by day 10.

 xxxg380xxx  is downregulated in g0-arrested (quiescent) cells and
upregulated in mitogen stimulated cells
to study the relationship between  xxxg380xxx  and ki-67 expression
we used a robust foreskin ﬁbroblast cell line that can be arrested
in the g0 cell cycle phase without major lose of viability. this
cell line constituvely express  xxxg380xxx . for this, cells were arrested
in the g0 phase after culture for 48 hr at full-conﬂuence in the
presence of 0.5% fcs. cells kept subconﬂuencent in an exponential phase in the presence of 10% fcs was used as a control.
 xxxg380xxx  was signiﬁcantly downregulated in the g0 arrested cells
(3%) compared to 72% expression in the exponential growing
cells (figs. 4a and 4b). to demonstrate if downregulation of
 xxxg380xxx  was accompanied with an absence of proliferation in the
g0 arrested cells, we double-stained cytospined cells for the
expression of both  xxxg380xxx  and ki-67 markers. figure 4c shows a
complete abolishment of  xxxg380xxx  in quiescent cells paralleled with
the absence of ki-67 marker. in contrast, cell kept in the exponential phase coexpressed both markers (fig. 4d).  xxxg380xxx  was restored
in the quiescent cells after reinstate cell proliferation (data not
shown).
finally, a slow-growing ﬁbroblast cell line expressing 50% of
 xxxg380xxx  molecule was cultured in the presence of egf as a strong
mitogen to increase proliferation.  xxxg380xxx  was upregulated to 80%

figure 5 – flow cytometry analysis of  xxxg380xxx  expression during
the different phases of cell cycle. a primary foreskin ﬁbroblast line
was cultured to reach conﬂuence (synchronization). each phase of the
cell cycle was recorded by measuring the dna content using  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining every 8 hr of cell culture.  xxxg380xxx  expression was
measured by staining cells with  xxxg380xxx -pe labeled antibody and quantifying ﬂuorescence by facscan. [color ﬁgure can be viewed in the
online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.]

in these cells conﬁrming the involvement of proliferation in the
induction of this molecule (data not shown).
 xxxg380xxx  is expressed in all cell cycle phases
since proliferation was shown to contribute directly to the
induction of  xxxg380xxx , we investigated which cell cycle phases are
linked to its expression. a ﬁbroblast cell line constituvely
expresses  xxxg380xxx  was synchronized by contact inhibition for 24 hr
to enter cells in the s phase and  xxxg380xxx  expression was four-hourly
measured for 36 hr. cells were able to enter the s phase after
16 hr and cell cycle was completed within 36 hr of culture.  xxxg380xxx 
was equally expressed in the g1, s, g2 and m phases. figure 5
represent the data recorded after 0, 8, 16, 24 hr.
discussion
it has been demonstrated that tumor cells in cancer upregulate
the inhibitory molecule  xxxg380xxx , which confers resistance to
antitumor immunity allowing cancer to escape from host immune
surveillance.13,28 the expression of this molecule has been
described in several malignancies11,14–19 where a strong association between its expression and the patients’ clinicopathological

parameters has been demonstrated.16–19 our previous study
showed a correlation between  xxxg380xxx  expression in breast cancer
patients and high-grade tumors, er negative and pr negative
tumors19 all of which represent high risk prognostic factors.
it is known that high grade tumors are characterized with low
tubular differentiation, high nuclear pleomorphism and high
mitotic count, the later of which is indicative of high proliferative
tumor cells.20 in addition, it is also known that er and pr negative breast epitheliums have a high proliferative index compared
to their positive counterparts.21,22 we hypothesized whether breast
cancer cells expressing the  xxxg380xxx  molecule also exert a high
proliferative index.
we have conﬁrmed our earlier observation of correlation
between  xxxg380xxx  expression and high histological grade, er negative and pr negative status19 in an extended study of 69 breast
cancer patients. we then challenged  xxxg380xxx  expression against
data obtained independently for each of the 3 components (tubular
differentiation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic index) of the
histological grade factor and found a correlation between this
molecule and nuclear pleomorphism and high mitotic index. the
association of both nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic index with
 xxxg380xxx  expression has also been reported in renal cell carcinoma.18 interestingly, we have found that mitotic index was the
most signiﬁcant component associated with  xxxg380xxx  expression
(p 5 0.007). therefore, we tested whether patients having a high
mitotic index (high proliferation) are also associated with er and
pr negative status and found a strong correlation for both factors
(p < 0.001 for er and p 5 0.027 for pr) indicating the importance of proliferation to the negativity status of both factors in
breast cancer in addition to normal breast epitheliums.21,22
in the present study we used the ki-67 marker to measure cell
proliferation. ki-67 is an antigen which is expressed exclusively
in both tumor and normal proliferating cells and absent in resting
cells making this molecule as an excellent marker to determine the
growth fraction of a given cell population.24 this marker has been
found to correlate with other proliferation markers such as mitotic
index, spf and thymidine kinase assays.23,29 in addition, ki-67 is
an appropriate marker for studying cell proliferation in both
patients’ tissues as well as cultured cells. we have used a cut-off
point of 20% and an expression median of 15%, which have been
recommended by others,23 to measure the growth fraction (ki-67
expression) in 69 breast cancer tissues. we have found a signiﬁcant linear correlation between  xxxg380xxx  expression and the presence
of ki-67 marker (p < 0.001). interestingly, most of the tumor cells
stained for  xxxg380xxx  marker were also positive for ki-67 expression.
one of the reasons which may explain the induction of  xxxg380xxx 
molecule in proliferative cells comes from the very recent ﬁnding,
which demonstrated that cord blood stem cells naturally express
the  xxxg380xxx  molecule and its expression was signiﬁcantly contributed to the low immunogenicity of these cells.30 it is also
known that a high rate of proliferation is a fundamental feature of
stem cells. therefore, it is possible that proliferation which is a
characteristic of stem cells induce  xxxg380xxx  to protect stem cells
from pathogenic self reactive t lymphocytes.
possible molecules involved in cell proliferation, which may
contribute to the induction of  xxxg380xxx  molecule have recently been
revealed. it has been shown that selective blocking of the akt molecule, which is a kinase necessary for cell proliferation,31 leads to
reduction of  xxxg380xxx  expression, while activation of the akt function increased  xxxg380xxx  expression.32 these ﬁndings support our
data showing the association of  xxxg380xxx  with cell proliferation.
the expression of  xxxg380xxx  in a small population of nonproliferating tumor cells (lacking ki-67 marker) seen in the present study
could be attributed to the presence of differentiated cells, which
have acquired the  xxxg380xxx  marker before differentiation and continue to express it thereafter. similar phenomenon was observed
in differentiated cells of  xxxg380xxx -positive primary breast cancer cell
(personal communications). on the other hand, the lack of  xxxg380xxx 
expression in some proliferating ki-67-positive tumor cells might

757

 xxxg380xxx  in high proliferating breast cancer cells

explain the involvement of other factors in the induction of  xxxg380xxx 
in addition to proliferation. it is important to mention that the
toll-like receptor-4, activated by factors such as lipopolysaccharide in the microenvironment, has been shown to induce  xxxg380xxx 
expression in tumors.33 regardless of the factors involved in its
induction, the presence of  xxxg380xxx  molecule can prevent the induction of autoimmunity against tissue restricted antigens through its
interaction with the  xxxg1688xxx  molecule expressed by lymphocytes.34
we have also found a strong association between ki-67 expression and other high-risk prognostic factors known to be related to
mitosis [er negative (p < 0.001), pr negative (p 5 0.011), sbr
(p < 0.001), nuclear pleomorphism (p < 0.001) and mitotic index
(p < 0.001)]. extensive work using ki-67 as a prognostic factor
and data from 40 studies involving 11,000 breast cancer patients
showed a strong evidence for the ability of ki-67 to discriminate
between good and bad prognostic groups in node-negative population.25 we and others have shown a strong association between
 xxxg380xxx  expression and bad prognostic factors in several malignancies.16–19,35 in the present study the strong link observed between
 xxxg380xxx  and ki-67 markers suggests that the low patients’ survival,25 seen in highly proliferating tumors, may be the results of
 xxxg380xxx  induction in proliferating tumor cells leading to the inhibition of the immune system10–12,36 and thereby providing more
advantages for the tumors to grow.
to further investigate the contribution of proliferation to the
induction of  xxxg380xxx  seen in breast cancer patients, we ﬁrst checked
whether  xxxg380xxx  can be induced in vitro in primary ﬁbroblasts and
epithelial cell lines obtained from both normal and breast cancer tissues.  xxxg380xxx  was expressed at very low levels (<5%) before cell
culture and its expression was upregulated (up to 100% expression)
in 8/8 primary cell lines. interestingly,  xxxg380xxx  was gradually
induced in cultured cells, and its upregulation was paralleled with
ki-67 induction (fig. 3b). the induction of  xxxg380xxx  molecule in the
current primary cell lines is not dependent on inﬂammatory cyto-

37–39

kines (g-ifn and  xxxg2296xxx ) known to induce  xxxg380xxx .
the similarity in the expression of  xxxg380xxx  in ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cell
cultures, obtained form either normal or tumor tissues, suggests that
 xxxg380xxx  is directly related to proliferation and not tumorgenesis (cell
transformation). similarly, parsa et al. have recently found that
expression of  xxxg380xxx  in human astrocytes was dependent on akt
activation but not on cellular immortalization or transformation.32
a direct effect of proliferation on  xxxg380xxx  expression was further
demonstrated in a primary  xxxg380xxx  expressing cell line arrested in
g0 phase. a complete abolishment of  xxxg380xxx  was recorded in quiescent cells paralleled with a complete downregulation of the ki67 marker in these cells. interestingly, restoring proliferation in
these cells lead to a complete re-induction of the  xxxg380xxx  molecule.
in addition,  xxxg380xxx  was signiﬁcantly upregulated, in a low-proliferating ﬁbroblast cell line, after provision of egf as a strong mitogen known to increase proliferation conﬁrming again the involvement of proliferation in the induction of  xxxg380xxx  molecule. furthermore, we have shown that  xxxg380xxx  induction was not restricted to a
certain phase of the cell cycle.
finally, we have provided evidence to the association between
 xxxg380xxx  expression and proliferation.  xxxg380xxx  induction in proliferative breast cancer cells may contribute to the bad prognosis seen
in high-grade tumors. understanding the mechanisms by which
 xxxg380xxx  is induced in proliferative cells may facilitate in designing
anti-proliferative drugs for breast cancer therapy.
