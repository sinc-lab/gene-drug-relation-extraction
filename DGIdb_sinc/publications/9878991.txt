 xxxd3303xxx  is a nonpeptide  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonist which selectively and insurmountably
inhibits the  xxxg99xxx   xxxg100xxx  subtype
without affecting other receptor systems involved
in cardiovascular regulation.
oral  xxxd3303xxx  dose-dependently reduced blood
pressure (bp) in various animal models of hypertension. in transgenic rats,  xxxd3303xxx  reduced
cardiac hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis.
when administered at dosages of 40 to 160mg
once daily to patients with mild to moderate hypertension,  xxxd3303xxx  significantly reduced systolic
and diastolic bp compared with placebo and was
at least as effective as atenolol 50 or 100mg and
lisinopril 10 to 40mg. one study showed  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/day to be more effective than enalapril 20 mg/day.
in 2 studies that used ambulatory bp monitoring,
once daily  xxxd3303xxx  provided better control of
diastolic bp for the full dosing interval than
losartan potassium 50mg or amlodipine 5 or 10mg.
in a single study in patients with severe hypertension, a  xxxd3303xxx -based regimen had antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of an enalapril-based
regimen.
 xxxd3303xxx  had a tolerability profile similar to that
of placebo in clinical studies.

 xxxd3303xxx 

the peptide hormone  xxxg99xxx  is a primary
effector of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) and
as such has potent pressor activity. ace inhibitors
block the formation of  xxxg99xxx  and are effective in the treatment of hypertension. however, in
addition to blocking the ras they may disrupt bradykinin, tachykinin and prostaglandin biosynthesis
and metabolism.  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists provide more specific blockade of  xxxg99xxx  at the receptor level and are expected to have
an improved tolerability profile compared with
ace inhibitors.  xxxd3303xxx  is an  xxxg99xxx 
receptor antagonist which has been developed for
the treatment of hypertension.
1. pharmacodynamic profile
in vitro studies

•  xxxd3303xxx  has demonstrated selectivity for
the angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  subtype in vitro. the
drug competitively inhibited binding of [ 125i] xxxg99xxx  to at1 receptors in rat lung tissue
[inhibition constant (ki) 3.7 nmol/l] but did not
affect binding of radiolabelled  xxxg99xxx  to
 xxxg101xxx  receptors in isolated rat adrenal medulla (ki
>10 000 nmol/l).[1] notably, the at1-inhibitory
effect of  xxxd3303xxx  was ≈6-fold that of losartan
potassium (ki 3.7 vs 23.7 nmol/l).[1] receptor binding of other peptide (e.g. endothelin) or nonpeptide

animal studies

• in anaesthetised pithed rats, intravenous  xxxd3303xxx  0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg dose-dependently shifted
the  xxxg99xxx  dose-response curve to the right
in a non-parallel manner.[1] the same doses of
 xxxd3303xxx  also dose-dependently attenuated the
pressor response to intravenous  xxxg99xxx 
(0.1 mug/kg) in anaesthetised rats and maintained a
significant inhibitory effect for at least 2 hours.[1]
• orally administered  xxxd3303xxx  significantly and
dose-dependently reduced blood pressure (bp)
in various experimental models of hypertension,
including renovascular hypertensive rats,[1,2] spontaneously hypertensive rats,[2,3] conscious sodiumdepleted cynomolgus monkeys[4] and transgenic
rats.[5]
• orally (0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg/day) or intravenously
(0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg/day) administered  xxxd3303xxx 
caused diuresis and natriuresis in conscious dogs
but did not affect potassium or creatinine excretion.[6]
• nine weeks’ treatment with antihypertensive
(1 and 3 mg/kg/day) or non-antihypertensive (0.1
mg/kg/day) doses of oral  xxxd3303xxx  significantly
reduced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats compared with untreated controls as assessed by heart
weight and cardiac muscle bundle diameter.[7] furthermore, the severe glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria evident in untreated control animals was
not observed in  xxxd3303xxx -treated animals.[8]
volunteer studies

• single oral doses of  xxxd3303xxx  20, 40 and 80mg
dose-dependently inhibited the pressor response
to an  xxxg99xxx  challenge in a randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving
drugs 1998 dec; 56 (6)

 xxxd3303xxx : new drug profile

48 healthy male volunteers.[9] inhibition was near
maximal with the 40mg dose, and at this dose the
drug had an onset and duration of action of 0.3 and
35.4 hours, respectively, suggesting that once daily
treatment is feasible. diuresis and natriuresis increased significantly and dose-dependently in the
first 3 hours after drug administration. aldosterone
and noradrenaline levels were unaffected by  xxxd3303xxx , but compensatory increases in plasma  xxxg99xxx  levels and plasma renin activity occurred.
2. pharmacokinetic profile
• a single oral dose of [14c]-radiolabelled  xxxd3303xxx  40mg was rapidly absorbed by 5 healthy volunteers; peak plasma concentrations (cmax; 44.7 mug/l)
were reached 1 hour (median) [t max] after drug
administration.[10]
• steady-state plasma concentrations were reached
within 7 days in 228 patients with mild to moderate hypertension treated with  xxxd3303xxx  20 to
160 mg/day for 4 weeks.[11]
• the area under the plasma  xxxd3303xxx  concentration-time curve was 491 mug/l • h after a 40mg
oral dose in volunteers; the mean residence time
was 17.0 hours.[10]
• a comparison of the absorption of oral and
intravenous  xxxd3303xxx  in 10 volunteers showed
 xxxd3303xxx  to have an absolute bioavailability of
43%.[10]
•  xxxd3303xxx  undergoes minimal biotransformation. after a radiolabelled 40mg oral dose in healthy
volunteers, 84% of the total radioactivity in plasma
was attributed to unchanged parent compound.[10]
• plasma protein binding of  xxxd3303xxx  was
>99% in 10 healthy male volunteers.[10,12] in rats,
the highest concentration of [14c]-radiolabelled
 xxxd3303xxx  was found in the liver, with lower levels in the blood, renal cortex and myocardium.
little of the drug was distributed to the brain.[12]
• the mean elimination half-life (t1⁄2) of  xxxd3303xxx  was ≈24 hours in 228 patients with mild to
moderate hypertension who received  xxxd3303xxx 
20 to 160 mg/day for 4 weeks.[11]

• virtually all (>98%) of an oral dose of  xxxd3303xxx  40mg was excreted in the faeces in healthy
volunteers;[10,13] the remainder was recovered in
the urine.[10] most (>90%) of an oral or intravenous
 xxxd3303xxx  dose was recovered within 120 hours.[10]
drug interactions

• the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3303xxx  120 mg/day
were not influenced by coadministration of warfarin in 12 healthy male volunteers.[14] in contrast,
trough plasma concentrations of warfarin were
significantly reduced during coadministration of
 xxxd3303xxx , although coagulation parameters were
unaffected.[14]
• in a multiple dose study involving 12 healthy
volunteers,  xxxd3303xxx  caused a variable increase
in digoxin serum levels. plasma digoxin concentrations should therefore be monitored in patients
taking this combination (data on file, glaxo wellcome).
3. therapeutic trials
comparison with placebo

• in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind
study involving 274 patients with mild to moderate
hypertension, 4 weeks’ treatment with  xxxd3303xxx 
40 to 160mg once daily significantly reduced supine diastolic and systolic bp compared with placebo (p < 0.05) [fig. 1] without significantly affecting heart rate.[11] bp reductions achieved with
 xxxd3303xxx  40 and 80 mg/day were close to those
seen with higher dosages. significant reductions in
diastolic bp were reported with all  xxxd3303xxx  dosages within 1 week and were maintained for the
duration of the study. at study end, trough/peak
ratios for diastolic bp were ≥84% with all  xxxd3303xxx  dosages and trough/peak ratios for systolic
bp were ≥66% with  xxxd3303xxx  dosages ≥40 mg/day,
thus confirming the sustained efficacy of the drug
over a 24-hour dosing period.[11]
comparisons with a beta-blocker

•  xxxd3303xxx  (40 to 120 mg/day) and atenolol (50
or 100 mg/day) demonstrated similar antihyperdrugs 1998 dec; 56 (6)

lisinopril). in patients who were observed for ≥39
weeks after dosage titration, trough bp was reduced by 22/17mm hg with  xxxd3303xxx  (n = 221)
and by 19/16mm hg with lisinopril (n = 116). the
addition of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg/day
improved the bp-lowering effects of  xxxd3303xxx 
in patients with low plasma renin activity (<0.8

placebo-controlled study involving 236 patients
with mild to moderate hypertension[15] and after a
longer period of treatment (26 weeks) in 533 patients who also had mild to moderate hypertension.[16] in the latter study, supine diastolic bp was
≤90mm hg and/or reduced by ≥10mm hg from
baseline in 84% of  xxxd3303xxx  compared with 78%
of atenolol recipients at study end (34 and 29% of
patients in each group required concomitant hydrochlorothiazide to achieve bp control).[16]
comparisons with ace inhibitors

•  xxxd3303xxx  40 to 160mg was as effective as
lisinopril 10 to 40mg after once daily administration for ≈1 year in patients with mild to moderate
hypertension treated in a randomised, double-blind
manner.[17] 74% of  xxxd3303xxx  and 72% of lisinopril recipients had diastolic bp <90mm hg at the
end of the 4- to 12-week titration period; 45 and
43% of patients in each treatment group, respectively, achieved bp control with the initial dosage (40 mg/day for  xxxd3303xxx  and 10 mg/day for

•  xxxd3303xxx  was at least as effective as enalapril
in patients with varying degrees of hypertension
who were randomised to either treatment.[18,19] in
440 patients with mild to moderate hypertension,
all dosages of  xxxd3303xxx  (40, 80, 120 and 160mg)
and the one dosage of enalapril studied (20mg)
significantly reduced supine bp compared with
placebo when administered once daily in a doubleblind manner for 12 weeks (p ≤ 0.001).[18] reductions in supine bp at week 12 were significantly
greater with  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/day than with enalapril 20 mg/day (p ≤ 0.03).[18] in patients with
severe hypertension treated in a nonblind manner
for 8 weeks, 27 of 57 (47%) of those who received
a  xxxd3303xxx  80 or 160 mg/day regimen and 9 of
28 (32%) who received an enalapril 20 or 40 mg/day
regimen had supine diastolic bp <90mm hg at
study end (fig. 2).[19] however, 72 and 71% of responders in the respective groups achieved this bp
reduction only after the addition of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day, and 33 and 21% of responders,
respectively, required the addition of both hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine 5 mg/day.[19]

comparison with an  xxxg99xxx 
receptor antagonist

• in a randomised, double-blind study involving
207 patients with mild to moderate hypertension,[20]
treatment with  xxxd3303xxx  40 or 80 mg/day or
losartan potassium 50 mg/day for 6 weeks significantly reduced 24-hour ambulatory bp compared
with placebo. however, both dosages of  xxxd3303xxx  reduced systolic and diastolic bp during the
final 6 hours of the dosing interval significantly
more effectively than losartan potassium (p ≤ 0.05).

comparison with a calcium antagonist

•  xxxd3303xxx  40 to 120 mg/day had efficacy
similar to that of the calcium antagonist amlodipine 5 or 10 mg/day in a placebo-controlled study
involving 185 patients with mild to moderate hypertension.[21] at study end, mean 24-hour ambulatory
bp was reduced by 18/11mm hg in  xxxd3303xxx  recipients and by 16/9mm hg in amlodipine recipients (both p < 0.05 vs placebo). both agents also
significantly reduced daytime and night-time bp
and therefore maintained their antihypertensive
efficacy throughout the dosing interval. however,
 xxxd3303xxx  was more effective than amlodipine at
reducing diastolic bp over the last 4 hours of the
dosing interval (p < 0.05).
4. tolerability
•  xxxd3303xxx  20 to 160 mg/day was as well tolerated as placebo in 274 patients with mild to moderate hypertension treated for 4 weeks; the total

in each group was 30.3 and 30.4%, respectively.[11]
the most common treatment-related adverse events
associated with  xxxd3303xxx  and placebo were headache (1.3 vs 2.2%) and dizziness (1.8 vs 0%).[11]
the majority of adverse events in  xxxd3303xxx  recipients were of mild to moderate severity and their
incidence was not related to dose.
•  xxxd3303xxx  40 to 120 mg/day was as well tolerated as atenolol 50 or 100 mg/day in 2 comparative studies involving a total of 769 patients with
mild to moderate hypertension treated for 12[15] or
26[16] weeks. impotence and fatigue were reported
more often with atenolol (4.0 and 3.4%, respectively) than with  xxxd3303xxx  (1 and 0.8%) in the
latter study.[16]
• no significant between-group differences were
observed in the type, incidence and severity of
adverse events reported in 86 patients with severe
hypertension who received  xxxd3303xxx  (80 or
160mg) or enalapril (20 or 40mg) once daily for
up to 8 weeks.[19] in 440 patients with mild to moderate hypertension treated for 12 weeks, however,
the incidence of treatment-related events was lower
in  xxxd3303xxx  (7.5%) than in enalapril (13.9%) or
placebo (10.5%) recipients.[18]
• the long term tolerability of  xxxd3303xxx  40 to
160 mg/day was better than that of lisinopril 10 to
40 mg/day in a study involving 578 patients with
mild to moderate hypertension treated for ≈1 year
(28 vs 40% of patients in each group reported treatment-related events; p = 0.001) [fig. 3].[17] notably, the incidence of cough was significantly lower
with  xxxd3303xxx  than with lisinopril (3 vs 7%; p =
0.018) [fig. 3] in this study[17] and in a study involving 88 patients with a history of ace inhibitor
cough (16 vs 60%; p = 0.001).[22] in the latter study,
the incidence of cough in  xxxd3303xxx  80mg recipients (16%) was not significantly different from
that in placebo recipients (10%).
