abstract
in a previous study, we showed that the psychoactive drug caffeine alters the expression of the dopamine 2
receptor ( xxxg656xxx ) gene in vitro and in vivo. here, we report that acute administration of antipsychotic and antiparkinsonian drugs also regulate  xxxg656xxx  gene expression in pc12 cells and in the mouse striatum. treatment of
pc12 cells with the atypical antipsychotic and specific 5-ht antagonist clozapine (60 µm) reduced  xxxg656xxx /luciferase
reporter expression by 46% after 24 h. however, male and female mice treated with a clinical dose of clozapine
(10 mg/kg) showed no changes in striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression when assayed by quantitative rt-pcr. treatment of pc12 cells with the specific  xxxg656xxx  agonist anti-parkinsonian drug, bromocriptine mesylate (bcm; 5 µm)
also resulted in decreased  xxxg656xxx /luciferase reporter activity (27%). in contrast to clozapine, a clinical dose of
bcm (16 mg/kg) led to a 21% decrease and a 45% increase in striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression in male and female
mice, respectively, after 24 h. coadministration of clozapine and bcm in pc12 cells resulted in a synergistic
decrease in  xxxg656xxx /luciferase reporter expression (68%), and coadministration of these drugs in vivo led to decreases
in striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression in both male and female mice (45% and 22%, respectively). collectively, these
results indicate that clozapine, bcm, or a combination of these drugs have differential effects on dopamine
receptor gene expression and might also affect striatal physiology in a sexually dimorphic manner.

introduction
the neurotransmitter dopamine is central to the
control of physiological functions in the mammalian
brain, including motor control, mood, and motivation (gingrich and caron, 1993). it is well known
that approx 80% of dopamine found in the brain is
located in the striatum, where it binds to the dopamine
1 and 2 receptors (d1r and  xxxg656xxx ) expressed on gabaergic medium spiny projection neurons (carlsson,
1959; stoof and kebabian, 1984). deficits in striatal
dopaminergic neurotransmission are linked to
numerous diseases, including the long-term neurodegenerative condition, parkinson’s disease (pd),

and the psychiatric disorder schizophrenia (mcgeer
et al., 1988; lewis and lieberman, 2000).
the pathologies underlying these conditions are
not fully understood; however, pd is currently
treated by dopamine replacement therapy, initially
by administering levodopa, which is converted into
dopamine by numerous cell types, including neurons
and glia within the brain. after 5 yr of treatment with
levodopa, 50% of pd patients develop dyskinesia
(fredduzzi et al., 2002). this can be alleviated in some
patients by treatment with the  xxxg656xxx -specific agonist
bromocriptine mesylate (bcm) (kartzinel et al.,
1976). however, bcm has been shown to induce
psychosis in patients (al-semaan et al., 1997).

schizophrenia is initially treated with  xxxg656xxx -specific
antagonists such as haloperidol, which, in most cases,
can successfully manage the negative symptoms of
the disease (ashby and wang, 1996). however, in
later stages of this disease, haloperidol is found to be
less effective in treating recurring psychotic episodes,
and augmentation therapy using antidepressants
such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
fluvoxamine has been used to alleviate the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia (silver, 2003). furthermore, haloperidol might contribute to the development of extrapyramidal side effects and
parkinsonian-like tremor in patients with schizophrenia (ashby and wang, 1996). consequently,
patients are treated with clozapine. clozapine is an
atypical antipsychotic, found to treat schizophrenia
effectively with a low incidence of extrapyramidal
side effects, a therapeutic outcome that might be
explained by the drug’s high and low affinities for
the 5-ht2a and d2 receptors, respectively (ashby
and wang, 1996). furthermore, clozapine has a broad
specificity for muscarinic, adrenergic, histaminergic,
as well as other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors (ashby and wang, 1996; rosenheck et al., 1997).
patient case reports have indicated that clozapine alone can be ineffective in managing symptoms
of schizophrenia (al-semaan, 1996). however, it has
been observed that patients treated with both clozapine and bcm show marked improvements in negative symptoms of schizophrenia. for instance, a
schizophrenic patient who was unresponsive to
clozapine also developed a pituitary adenoma. the
patient, who was then treated with bcm for the adenoma, showed significant improvement of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (al-semaan, 1996).
similarly, dopamine agonist-induced psychosis in
patients suffering from pd or pituitary adenoma can
be successfully treated with low doses of clozapine
(meltzer et al., 1995; al-semaan et al., 1997; svetel
et al., 1997). these observations prompt the need to
determine whether clozapine, bcm, or a combination
of these drugs differentially regulates the expression
of dopamine receptor genes in the brain.
in a previous study, we demonstrated that adenosine receptor drugs, such as caffeine, and 8-(3chlorostyryl) caffeine, dynamically regulate
transcription of the  xxxg656xxx  gene in vitro and in vivo
(stonehouse et al., 2003b). in the present study, we
have investigated whether clozapine, bcm, or a combination of both drugs can alter the activity of a
 xxxg656xxx /luciferase reporter construct in pc12 cells and
expression of  xxxg656xxx  mrna in the mouse striatum. we

found that bcm decreased  xxxg656xxx  reporter activity and
striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression in male mice but
increased striatal  xxxg656xxx  gene expression in female
mice, demonstrating a sexually dimorphic response
to this drug. coadministration of bcm and clozapine produced a significant reduction in  xxxg656xxx /
luciferase expression and striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrnaexpression in both male and female mice. these data indicate that use of bcm, clozapine, and both drugs
together lead to different responses in  xxxg656xxx  gene
expression that also vary between males and females.

materials and methods
a luciferase reporter construct containing the
–1515 to +329 region of the mouse  xxxg656xxx  gene (accession no. u79717) has been described previously
(stonehouse et al., 2003b). this dna fragment was
generated by 30 cycles of pcr amplification on a
thermocycler (perkin elmer, shelton, ct) with  xxxg656xxx 
gene-specific primers, using rat genomic dna as a
template (clontech, palo alto, ca). the pcr product was then subcloned into the pgl3basic vector
(promega, madison, wi). the construct was subjected to automated dna sequencing (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca).
rat pc12 cells were obtained from the american
tissue culture collection and cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (dmem) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5%
fetal calf serum, and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin/
glutamine (gibco brl, carlsbad, ca). cells were
dissociated in 1 × trypsin/edta (gibco brl),
washed in serum-free dmem, and resuspended in
media. for transfection, 6 × 105 pc12 cells were
seeded in each well of a six-well plate (costar, tustin,
ca). twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were
transfected with 1 µg of the promoterless luciferase
reporter vector, pgl3basic (promega) to examine
background luciferase activity, or with 1 µg of  xxxg656xxx 
luciferase reporter construct as described previously
(copertino et al., 1997). in all experiments, cells were
cotransfected with 100 ng of the plasmid pcmvbeta
(clontech) to assess transfection efficiency and to
normalize luciferase activity values to an internal
reference standard of beta-galactosidase activity.
pc12 cells were transiently transfected using
fugene 6 (roche, indianapolis, in) and opti-mem
i media (gibco brl). after 24 h, cells were treated
with clozapine (1–60 µm), bcm (5–50 µm), or both
drugs (10 µm clozapine and 50 µm bcm). after an
additional 24 h, cells were harvested, washed in pbs

(gibco brl), resuspended in 150 µl of 1 × reporter
lysis buffer (promega), and assayed for beta-galactosidase
activity using the fluoreporter kit (molecular
probes, eugene, or) and then for luciferase activity
using a microlumat lb968 luminometer, as described
previously (copertino et al., 1997). the data presented
in fig. 1 (below) were derived from at least three
independent experiments, performed in triplicate.
in acute in vivo studies, three male and three female
cd-1 mice, aged 3–6 mo (harlan sprague dawley,
indianapolis, in), were administered 10 mg/kg
clozapine, 16 mg/kg bcm, or both drugs (dissolved in 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx , sigma, st louis,
mo), each by intraperitoneal (ip) injection. in sham
mice, an appropriate volume of 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx  (10 µl/g of mouse weight) was injected.
twenty-four hours later, all mice, including
untreated naïve controls, were sacrificed and the
striata were dissected.
total rnawas extracted from mouse striata using
trizol reagent (invitrogen). one microgram of rna
was reverse transcribed using random hexamers
and superscript ii reverse transcriptase (invitrogen). pcr was then carried out using either  xxxg656xxx 
(5’-ggtgagtggaaattcagcagg-3’ and 5’tcgatgctgatggcacaca-3’) or  xxxg861xxx  (gap3dh)
gene-specific primers (5’-ggcaagttcaacggcacag-3’ and 5’-tcgctcctggaagatggtg-3’). pcr products were labeled by incorporating
fluorescent dntps using the sybr green pcr
master mix (applied biosystems). quantitation of
fluorescent pcr products was performed using the
geneamp 5700 sequence detector (applied biosystems).  xxxg861xxx 
(gap3dh) pcr products generated after 15–18
cycles were used to normalize quantities of cdna,
allowing quantification of  xxxg656xxx  pcr products generated after 25–28 cycles per sample, respectively.
dopamine 2 receptor ( xxxg656xxx ) and gap3dh expression
levels were derived from at least three independent
experiments, in which nine separate pcr reactions
were performed on each of the cdna samples.

drugs alter the expression of the  xxxg656xxx  gene. therefore, we prepared a luciferase reporter construct containing the 5’ end of the rat  xxxg656xxx  gene and examined
its activity in response to different concentrations of
clozapine, bcm, or a combination of both drugs. the
reporter construct contained 1515 bp of the rat  xxxg656xxx 
promoter sequence and the entire first exon (329 bp)
of the  xxxg656xxx  gene.
to determine whether the activity of this reporter
was affected by clozapine, bcm, or a combination
of both drugs, the  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct was transiently transfected into pc12 cells. twenty-four
hours later, cells were treated with a micromolar
range of drug concentrations. after an additional
24 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase
activity. as shown in fig. 1a, clozapine concentrations of
1 and 10 µm decreased activity by an average 11%; however, a concentration of 60 µm decreased activity of
the  xxxg656xxx  reporter by 46%. next we examined the
effect of bcm on  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct activity. as
shown in fig. 1b, 5, 20, and 50 µm bcm decreased
activity of the  xxxg656xxx  reporter an average of 29%, with
the lowest dose of 5 µm decreasing activity by 27%.
finally, we examined the additive effect of bcm and
clozapine on  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct expression. as
shown in fig. 1c, 50 µm bcm and 10 µm clozapine
decreased expression of the  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct
in pc12 cells. this response was reduced further by
simultaneous administration of 10 µm clozapine and
50 µm bcm. these results indicate that clozapine
and bcm, when coadministered in the low micromolar range, are additive in reducing  xxxg656xxx  promoter
activity.

anti-parkinsonian and antipsychotic drugs
regulate the expression of  xxxg656xxx  mrna
in the mouse striatum
to examine whether anti-parkinsonian and
antipsychotic drugs can regulate striatal expression
of the  xxxg656xxx  gene in vivo, male and female mice were
treated with 10 mg/kg clozapine, 16 mg/kg bcm,
or a combination of both drugs. levels of  xxxg656xxx  mrna
expression in the striatum were examined 24 h later
using quantitative rt-pcr.
as shown in fig. 2a, clozapine produced no
changes in  xxxg656xxx  mrnaexpression in male or female
mice when compared with that in sham-treated
mice as well as naïve controls (data not shown). in
contrast, as shown in fig. 2b, bcm led to a 21%
decrease and 45% increase in striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrna
expression in male and female mice, respectively,
when compared with that in sham-treated mice.

the coadministration of these drugs led to decreases
in striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression of 45% and 22%
in male and female mice, respectively, when compared with that in sham-treated mice, as shown in
fig. 2c. collectively, these results demonstrate that
administration of bcm, or a combination of clozapine and bcm, produces sexually dimorphic patterns
of  xxxg656xxx  gene expression in the mouse striatum.

discussion
this study examined regulation of  xxxg656xxx  gene
expression by anti-parkinsonian and antipsychotic
drugs in pc12 cells. we found that activities of
luciferase reporter constructs driven by the 5’ end
of the rat  xxxg656xxx  gene were decreased by clozapine and
bcm in the low micromolar range; furthermore,
coadministration of both drugs synergistically
reduced reporter construct expression even further
in pc12 cells. in vivo, acute bcm treatment resulted
in a sexually dimorphic response, leading to
increased and decreased striatal  xxxg656xxx  mrnaexpression in female and male mice, respectively. in contrast, clozapine administration did not alter striatal
 xxxg656xxx  gene expression significantly in either male or
female mice. however, coadministration of both
drugs led to significant decreases in striatal  xxxg656xxx  gene
expression in both male and female mice. the
decrease in  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression in male mice and
 xxxg656xxx  reporter construct expression in pc12 cells
caused by bcm was similar in magnitude. similarly,
coadministration of both drugs decreased striatal
 xxxg656xxx , as well as  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct expression
in mice and pc12 cells.

(–1515/+329) luciferase reporter construct. (a) pc12 cells
were treated with 1 and 10 µm clozapine, which
decreased expression of the  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct by
statistically insignificant 11% (p = 0.786) and 12% (p =
0.184), respectively. however, treatment with 60 µm
clozapine decreased  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct by 46% (***;
p ≤ 0.001). (b) treatment of pc12 cells with 5, 20, and
50 µm bcm decreased  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct expression by 27% (***; p ≤ 0.001), 29%, and 32%, respectively. (c) coadministration of 10 µm clozapine and 50
µm bcm to pc12 cells reduced  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct
expression by 68% (***; p ≤ 0.001, post hoc test). error

in an earlier study, we showed that mice treated
acutely with the adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine (50 mg/kg), responded with a 31% decrease
and 94% increase in striatal  xxxg656xxx  gene expression in
male and female mice, respectively (stonehouse
et al., 2003b). the findings presented in this study
indicate that acute treatment with the  xxxg656xxx -specific
agonist, bcm (16 mg/kg), results in a similar sexually dimorphic response in mice, with a 21% decrease
and a 45% increase in striatal  xxxg656xxx  gene expression
in male and female mice, respectively. similar to the
male mouse response, transfected pc12 cells showed
decreased activity of the  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct
when treated with bcm (5 µm). significantly, it has
been shown that  xxxg656xxx  and the adenosine 2a receptor
( xxxg82xxx ) are coexpressed in striatopallidal projection
neurons in the striatum (schiffmann and vanderhaeghen, 1993; aizman et al., 2000) and that these
receptors form functional molecular complexes
(ferre et al., 1991; diaz-cabiale et al., 2001). in addition, blockade of  xxxg82xxx  has been shown to potentiate
 xxxg656xxx  agonist-mediated locomotor activity (fuxe and
ungerstedt, 1974). therefore, these findings indicate
that caffeine and bcm lead to similar responses in
striatal  xxxg656xxx  gene expression.
deficits in striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission are linked to numerous diseases, including the
neurodegenerative condition pd, which is currently
treated by dopamine replacement therapy—in the
first instance by administration of the dopaminomimetic drug levodopa. however, adjunct therapy
with the  xxxg656xxx -specific agonist bcm allows a reduction in the effective dose of levodopa, together with
improvements in tremor, gait, posture, balance,

clozapine (10 mg/kg, ip), bcm (16 mg/kg, ip), or coadministration of both drugs (10 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg, respectively, ip). (a) in male mice, clozapine produced no changes
in  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression (p = 0.959); similarly, in female
mice, clozapine treatment increased  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression by a statistically insignificant 5% (p = 0.646). (b) in
male mice, bcm decreased  xxxg656xxx  mrna expression by 21%
(***; p = 0.001); however, in female mice, bcm increased
 xxxg656xxx  mrna expression by 45% (***; p = 0.001). (c) coadministration of both clozapine and bcm decreased  xxxg656xxx 
gene expression by 45% (***; p ≤ 0.001) and 22% (*; p =
0.037, post hoc test) in male and female mice, respectively.
error bars represent s.e.m. the data presented were derived
from striatal rna obtained from three male and three female
mice per treatment. overall, nine separate pcr reactions
were carried out for each of the rna samples.

rigidity, and manual dexterity (kartzinel et al., 1976).
in addition, levodopa can induce psychosis in
patients suffering from pd; this can be alleviated by
concomitant treatment with low doses of the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine (meltzer et al., 1995;
svetel et al., 1997). similarly, bcm, when used to
treat pituitary adenoma, can also induce psychosis,
which can be treated with low doses of clozapine
while allowing continued bcm therapy (al-semaan
et al., 1997). occasionally, clozapine treatment alone
can be ineffective in managing negative symptoms
of the psychiatric disorder schizophrenia. it has been
observed that schizophrenic patients initially treated
with clozapine, followed by bcm to treat pituitary
adenoma, show marked improvements in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (al-semaan, 1996).
in addition, patients suffering from schizophrenia
might also develop early-onset pd, presenting a difficult therapeutic challenge; clozapine can be used
to treat both conditions without dopamine agonists
(orr et al., 2001).
although previous studies have described the
favorable clinical effects of the individual and concomitant administration of bcm and clozapine, little
attention has been paid to their effects on dopamine
receptor gene expression in the striatum. earlier studies have shown that chronic clozapine exposure
(20 mg/kg) in rats decreases  xxxg656xxx  gene expression
in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens,
both of which are structures within the striatum. this
is in contrast to typical antipsychotic drugs that raise
 xxxg656xxx  expression in the striatum (damask et al., 1996).
the data in the present study suggest that a single
dose of clozapine (10 mg/kg) has no effect on striatal  xxxg656xxx  gene expression in male or female mice;
this difference might be explained by the chronic
nature (14 d exposure) of the earlier study. however,
in pc12 cells transfected with the  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct and then acutely treated with clozapine (60 µm),
reporter construct expression decreased.
to our knowledge, little is known concerning how
drugs that affect the physiology of the striatum alter
gene expression. in our earlier study, we demonstrated that acute administration of the psychoactive,  xxxg82xxx  antagonists, caffeine and 8-(3-chlorostyryl)
caffeine, have sexually dimorphic effects on striatal
 xxxg656xxx  gene expression (stonehouse et al., 2003b). in
the present study, we have shown a similar sexually
dimorphic response of male and female mice to
bcm, a  xxxg656xxx -specific agonist. furthermore, this
sexually dimorphic response is eliminated when
clozapine is coadministered. other studies have

journal of molecular neuroscience

stonehouse and jones
examined changes in gene expression as a result of
drug treatment and have shown that morphine
administration produces differential expression patterns of the immediate early gene, c-fos in the striatum of male and female rats (d’souza et al., 1999).
furthermore, these sexually dimorphic responses
were demonstrated to be influenced by both sex
steroid-dependent and -independent mechanisms
(d’souza et al., 2002).
dopamine 2 receptor ( xxxg656xxx ) agonists such as bcm
and pramipexole recently have been shown to have
neuroprotective effects in parkinsonian models
when used in conjunction with levodopa for the treatment of pd (kitamura et al., 2003). although the
detailed mechanisms of the pathogenesis of pd are
unclear, it has been suggested that levodopa itself
can nonenzymatically induce oxidative damage to
neurons in culture, and this can be prevented by the
 xxxg656xxx  agonist pramipexole (vonvoigtlander et al.,
1998). in addition, bcm and pramipexole are neuroprotective in animal models of pd, and these effects
might arise as a consequence of these drugs having
antioxidant or mitochondrial membrane-potential
stabilization properties (kitamura et al., 2003).
in this study we showed that a wide range of bcm
concentrations (5–50 µm), including the clinical concentration of 20 µm, produced similar levels of suppression of  xxxg656xxx  reporter expression in pc12 cells (an
average of 29%). this level of suppression was similar to that caused by the bcm clinical dose of 16 mg/kg
administered to male mice (21%). the suppression
of  xxxg656xxx  gene expression by bcm might be related to
its antioxidant function; however, further investigation will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis by
examining, for example, the effect of concomitant
administration of clinical and high doses of levodopa
and bcm on  xxxg656xxx  gene expression.
concomitant administration of 50 µm bcm and
10 µm clozapine in pc12 cells synergistically suppressed  xxxg656xxx  reporter construct activity by 68%. a
similar effect was observed in male mice coadministered with clinical doses of 16 mg/kg bcm and
10 mg/kg clozapine, where  xxxg656xxx  gene expression was
suppressed by 45%. if bcm suppresses  xxxg656xxx  gene
expression via its antioxidant properties, it is tenable
that clinical doses of clozapine, which also has been
shown to have antioxidant properties (dalla libera
et al., 1998), augments the antioxidant effect of bcm
and further suppresses  xxxg656xxx  gene expression. future
studies that examine the role of bcm, clozapine,
and the combination of both of these drugs in modulating receptor agonist properties and antioxidant

dopamine drugs and  xxxg656xxx  gene expression
activities might provide additional insights into the
relative contributions of receptor-mediated and
antioxidant effects on  xxxg656xxx  gene regulation.
in summary, we conclude that  xxxg656xxx  gene expression is responsive to a variety of psychoactive,
antipsychotic, and anti-parkinsonian drugs and combinations thereof. these responses are dynamic and
also show gender specificity. therefore, an improved
understanding of how changes in dopamine receptor gene expression by these drugs leads to alterations
in striatal physiology is necessary and will enhance
therapeutic advances in a number of movement and
psychiatric disorders.
