differential regulation of t-cell growth by il-2 and il-15
georgina h. cornish, linda v. sinclair, and doreen a. cantrell

although  xxxg1173xxx  (il-2) and il-15
signal through the common gamma chain
(␥c) and through  xxxg1175xxx  ␤–chain
( xxxg1175xxx ) subunits, they direct distinct
physiologic and immunotherapeutic responses in t cells. the present study
provides some insight into why il-2 and
il-15 differentially regulate t-cell function
by revealing that these cytokines are strikingly distinct in their ability to control
protein synthesis and t-cell mass. il-2
and il-15 are shown to be equivalent

mitogens for antigen-stimulated cd8ⴙ t
cells but not for equivalent growth factors. antigen-primed t cells cannot autonomously maintain amino acid incorporation or de novo protein synthesis
without exogenous cytokine stimulation.
both il-2 and il-15 induce amino acid
uptake and protein synthesis in antigenactivated t cells; however, the il-2 response is strikingly more potent than the
il-15 response. the differential action of
il-2 and il-15 on amino acid uptake and

protein synthesis is explained by temporal differences in signaling induced by
these 2 cytokines. hence, the present
results show that cytokines that are
equivalent mitogens can have different
potency in terms of regulating protein
synthesis and cell growth. (blood. 2006;

introduction
 xxxg1173xxx  (il-2) and il-15 are critical but functionally distinct
regulators of peripheral t-lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. il-2 and il-15 interact with t cells through cytokine receptor
complexes consisting of the common gamma chain (␥c), a common
␤-chain subunit ( xxxg1175xxx ), and a unique ␣-chain subunit that
confers high-affinity cytokine binding.1,2 cd25 is the  xxxg1175xxx 
␣ ( xxxg1175xxx ␣) chain, and il-15 binds with high affinity to the unique
il-15r␣ subunit.3,4 il-2 was the first cytokine shown to drive
mitosis in activated t cells,5 but its mitogenic role can be
supplanted by other ␥c cytokines in vivo.6 nevertheless, il-2 has
essential nonredundant functions in vivo, including the efficient
production of effector cytotoxic t cells, the control of regulatory
t-cell survival,7 the maintenance of tolerance, and the continuance
of t-cell expansion.8-13 il-15 also has unique functions in vivo,
where it has been shown to be crucial for nk-cell development and
vital for the generation and maintenance of cd8⫹ memory t
cells.1,14-16 the different physiologic functions of il-2 and il-15
are reflected by their differential actions as immunotherapeutic
agents.17-20 in particular, compared with il-2, il-15 has been
shown to act as a superior stimulus for the generation of memory
and effector t cells after vaccination or adoptive transfer of
tumor-specific t cells.21 hence, interest in using exogenous il-15
rather than il-2 for immunotherapy has increased.
the different physiologic and immunotherapeutic functions of
il-2 and il-15 are not easy to explain in molecular terms. in
fibroblasts and dendritic cells, there is evidence that il-15r␣
subunits may signal to cell survival factors through pathways not
used by il-2.22,23 however, the immediate biochemical consequences of triggering t cells with il-2 and il-15 result in a
common, indistinguishable biochemical response, a reflection of

signaling through the common ␥c/ xxxg1175xxx  complex.24,25 for example, il-2 and il-15 both activate the janus kinases  xxxg1219xxx  and
 xxxg1221xxx  and the transcription factor  xxxg2216xxx . moreover, cdna
microarray analysis has revealed that immediate t-cell responses to
il-2 and il-15 induce similar gene expression profiles.24 the
commonality of immediate biochemical and transcriptional responses to il-2 and il-15 in t cells should mean that these
cytokines dictate a common biologic outcome. however, the fact
they do not means there are differences in the signaling pathways
triggered by il-2 and il-15, explaining their unique functions. in
this context, one study has documented differential sensitivity of
il-2– and il-15–induced t-cell proliferation to the immunosuppressive agent rapamycin.26 this drug works by regulating the activity
of the  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor), a key regulator of
mrna translation and protein synthesis.27
historically, il-2 was called  xxxg1173xxx  because of its
ability to simultaneously induce cell-cycle progression and increased
cell size.28 however, activated cd8⫹ t cells maintained in the presence
of il-15 are described as small compared with il-2–maintained
cells.29-31 this supports the idea that il-2 and il-15 may differ in their
ability to regulate t-cell growth. in this context, analyses of il-2 and
il-15 signal transduction have focused on their immediate biochemical
and transcriptional programs,24,25,32 not on their effects on cell metabolism and cell growth. the question of how t-cell cytokines regulate
t-cell growth is important because even if different cytokines can induce
a common genetic program, differences in how they modify protein
synthesis, cellular energy, and metabolism influence how this genetic
program is executed. indeed, the terms mitogen and growth factor are
frequently used interchangeably to describe ␥c cytokines, even though
they are not synonymous. a growth factor is a molecule that regulates

differential regulation of t-cell growth

cell metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell mass, whereas a mitogen
controls cell division and proliferation. these are not the same processes, nor are growth and cell division necessarily directly coordinated
in eukaryotic cells.33-35 thus a potent mitogen may not be a potent
growth factor. accordingly, in the present study, the actions of il-2 and
il-15 on protein synthesis and cell growth of antigen-activated t cells
were compared. the results indicate that il-2 and il-15 are strikingly
different growth factors for antigen-activated t cells, reflecting differences in the ability of these 2 cytokines to regulate cellular amino acid
uptake and protein synthesis. the differential regulation of protein
synthesis and t-cell mass by il-2 and il-15 offers insights that could be
key to understanding the unique nonredundant actions of these cytokines.

t cells were washed and fixed in 0.5% pfa for 15 minutes at 37°c, washed
twice in pbs, and permeabilized for 15 minutes in 90% methanol at
⫺20°c. cells were washed twice in pbs and blocked for 10 minutes at
room temperature (rt) in bsa buffer (0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in
pbs). cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of primary anti–phospho-s6
(cell signaling technologies) in bsa buffer for 30 minutes at rt. cells
were washed once with bsa buffer and were incubated with 1 ␮g
fitc-conjugated donkey anti–rabbit igg (jackson immunoresearch) for
30 minutes at rt in the dark. samples were washed in bsa buffer and
analyzed on a facscalibur. pharmacologic stimulation for 30 minutes
with 2 ␮g/ml of the  xxxd2925xxx , phorbol 12.13 dibutyrate (pdbu), was
used to stimulate all available s6 protein in the cell and served as a
positive control.

antigen-activated p14 lcmv cd8⫹ t cells were resuspended in rpmi
1640/10% fcs/50 ␮m ␤me and were seeded in triplicate at 5 ⫻ 104 to
1 ⫻ 105 cells/well in 96-well, flat-bottom microtiter plates. cells were
cultured with medium alone or with different concentrations of cytokines
il-2, il-15, or medium alone. cells were then cultured at 37°c in a 5%
co2-humidified incubator for the indicated time. before harvesting, 1 ␮ci
(0.037 mbq) tritiated [3h]-thymidine (amersham biosciences, amersham,
united kingdom) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for
another 2 hours. cells were harvested using vacuum aspiration onto glass
matrix filters. incorporated radioactivity was quantified with a ␤-microplate
scintillation counter.

spleens and lymph nodes were removed from 2- to 6-month-old p14
lcmv tcr transgenic mice, mashed in cell strainers, and suspended in
rpmi with 10% fcs and 1 ␮m gp33-41 lcmv tcr-specific peptide for
2 days. the lcmv gp33-41 peptide kavynfatm was synthesized and
purified in the cancer research uk protein production laboratory.
thereafter, cells were washed out of peptide and cultured in recombinant
human (rh) il-2 (proleukin; chiron b.v., leiden, the netherlands) or
rhil-15 (peprotech, rocky hill, nj) or left in rpmi 1640/10% fcs
(heat-inactivated)/50 ␮m ␤me as a control. unless otherwise indicated,
cytokine concentrations were 20 ng/ml, and cells were cultured at a density
of 0.25 to 1 ⫻ 106/ml. to inhibit pi3k, the inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  (promega,
madison, wi)37,38 was added to cell cultures at a final concentration
of 10 ␮m.

the rate of amino acid uptake into antigen-stimulated p14 lcmv cd8⫹ t
cells in response to different concentrations of il-2, il-15, or medium alone
was assayed by resuspending antigen-activated cd8⫹ t cells in rpmi

cells/well in 96-well, flat-bottom microtiter plates. cells were then cultured
at 37°c in a 5% co2 humidified incubator for the indicated time. tritiated
[3h]–amino acid mix (amersham biosciences), 2 ␮ci/well (0.074 mbq),
was added to the plates for 6 hours before harvesting by vacuum aspiration

fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc), phycoerythrin (pe), or allophycocyanin
(apc). tricolor (tricol) was obtained from caltag (burlingame, ca).
anti–mouse il-15r␣ antibody was obtained from r&d systems (minneapolis mn), phospho-s6 ribosomal protein (ser235/236) antibody was
obtained from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma), and secondary
anti–goat and anti–rabbit fitc–conjugated antibodies were from jackson
immunoresearch labs (west grove, pa).
samples were stained for surface expression of the following markers
with antibody clonal typing in parentheses: cd25 ( xxxg1175xxx ␣ chain,  xxxd924xxx , 7d4,
3c7), cd62l (l-selectin, lecam-1, ly-22, mel-14), common ␥ chain
(␥c) (4g3), il-15r␣ (r&d systems), cd71 (transferrin receptor, c2f2),
and cd98 (42f, h202-141). for identification of naive p14 tcr transgenic
cd8⫹ t cells in spleen and lymph node and p14 tcr transgenic mouse
blood typing, the following markers were used: thy1.2 (cd90.2, 53-2.1),
cd8a (ly-2, 53-6.7, tricol 5h10), cd4 (l3t4, tricol rm4-5,  xxxd955xxx .5), v␣2
(trc, b20.1), and v␤8 (tcr, f23.1). in most cases, cells were blocked for
30 minutes at 4°c with mouse fc block (cd16/32, fc ␥ iii/ii receptor,
2.4g2). cells were then stained with saturating concentrations of antibody
at 4°c for 20 to 60 minutes at 1 ⫻ 106 cells per sample and were washed
before analysis on a facscalibur (becton dickinson, san jose, ca).
events were collected and stored ungated, and data were analyzed with
cellquest (becton dickinson) software. live cells were gated according to
their forward light scatter (fsc) and side light scatter (ssc) profiles.

to determine amino acid incorporation into cellular protein, antigenstimulated p14 lcmv cd8⫹ t cells were cultured in 20 ng/ml of il-2,
il-15, or medium alone at 106 cells per milliliter for indicated time points.
cells were pulsed for 12 hours before harvest with 5 ␮ci (0.185 mbq)/ml

results
il-2 and il-15 are potent t-cell mitogens but differentially affect
t-cell growth–related size and morphology

experiments to compare the ability of il-2 and il-15 to regulate
growth or cell mass used antigen-activated cd8⫹ t cells from the
p14 tcr transgenic mouse model in which peripheral cd8⫹ t
cells express a v␣2/v␤8.1 tcr specific for the lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (lcmv-gp) peptide gp33-41,
presented by the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i
molecule h-2db.36 the rationale for this choice of model is that
il-2 and il-15 are equivalent mitogens for antigen-primed p14
cd8⫹ t cells in vitro but regulate their differentiation by different
methods. antigen-primed p14 cd8⫹ t cells cultured in the
presence of il-2 differentiate into large cytotoxic effector t cells,
whereas t cells maintained with il-15 develop into small cells with
a phenotype reminiscent of cd8⫹ memory t cells.29,30 splenocytes
were isolated from p14 lcmv mice and were cultured with
gp33-41 (1 ␮m) peptide for 2 days to generate activated cd8⫹ t
lymphoblasts. figure 1a shows il-2 and il-15 induced equivalent
dna synthesis in antigen-primed cd8⫹ t cells and could sustain
exponential division of these cells over 5 to 6 days (figure 1b).
during the early phase of this response, the cell-doubling time of t
cells maintained in il-2 or il-15 was equivalent and resulted in a
200- to 500-fold increase in cell numbers. thereafter, at days 6 to 8,
responses to the 2 cytokines diverged: t cells maintained in il-2
stopped proliferating and declined in number. this decline in cell
numbers resulted from increased apoptosis.39 in contrast, t cells
maintained for a similar time in il-15 slowed in their division rate
but survived for prolonged periods (figure 1b).
during the exponential phase of cell proliferation, cells cultured
in il-2 or il-15 were of a visually distinct size and morphology
(figure 2). antigen-primed t cells proliferating in response to il-2
are large granular blasts, whereas t cells proliferating in il-15 are
smaller and less granular. these differences are easily visible by
light microscopy (figure 2a) and by flow cytometric analysis of
fsc and ssc profiles of il-2– and il-15–cultured t cells (figure
2b). flow cytometric analysis of fsc and ssc profiles estimates
cell size and granularity but cannot distinguish whether cell volume

recombinant mouse icam-1/fc chimera, and were filmed in rpmi 1640 (10% fcs,

a motorized microscope (carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany). cells were visualized

content has changed. the data in figure 2c show the protein
content of t cells maintained in il-2 or il-15. t cells cultured
with il-2 had substantially higher protein content than cells
cultured in il-15.

antigen activation of naive t cells caused the cells to increase in
size. the dramatic size difference between antigen-activated and
primary naive t cells was readily demonstrated by flow cytometric
analysis of fsc and ssc profiles, shown by the comparison of ex
vivo cd8⫹ naive p14 tcr transgenic t cells and t cells stimulated
for 2 days by the lcmv gp33-41 peptide–complexed antigenpresenting cells (figure 3a-b). the size difference between
quiescent cd8⫹ t cells and activated t-cell blasts was further
defined by the 2- to 4-fold increase in cellular protein levels after
resting cd8⫹ t cells were activated (figure 3c).
the size and morphology of antigen-activated t lymphoblasts
were comparable to those of effector t cells cultured in il-2,
whereas t cells cultured long term with il-15 were markedly
smaller (figure 2). hence, il-2 could maintain the size of
antigen-activated t cells, but il-15 could not. the data in figure

il-15 grew smaller over 24 to 72 hours. the first point to note is
that antigen-activated t lymphoblasts cultured in medium alone, in
the absence of exogenous antigen or cytokine stimuli, rapidly
became smaller as judged by reductions in their flow cytometric
fsc and ssc profiles (figure 3d). these changes were seen within
24 to 48 hours of antigen depravation; at later time points, the cells
died. when antigen-activated t cells were cultured with il-2, their
size was maintained (figure 3d). in contrast, antigen-activated t
cells cultured in il-15 lost size and protein content. this was not an
immediate response, as occurred with complete withdrawal of
cytokine; rather, it occurred over 48 to 72 hours (figure 3b). the
first indication that il-15 could not maintain the morphology of
antigen-activated t cells was the similar protein content seen by
comparison of the side scatter profiles of t cells maintained in il-2
or il-15 for 24 hours. differences in the protein content of
antigen-pulsed t cells cultured with il-2 compared with il-15
were slower to emerge, but t cells exposed to il-15 for 48 to 72
hours had reduced fsc and ssc and lower protein content than t
cells maintained for an equivalent time in il-2 (figure 3d).
changes to the morphology and size of antigen-activated t cells
cultured in il-15 were not permanent. they were reversible, as
evidenced by the fact that il-15–maintained t cells switched to a
culture containing il-2 rapidly increased in cell size (figure 3e).

cells stimulated with il-15 (figure 4a). the differences between
il-2 and il-15 in amino acid uptake translated to differences in
protein synthesis. hence, when the ability of these 2 cytokines to
induce the incorporation of tritiated [3h] amino acids into cellular
proteins was compared, the il-2 response markedly exceeded the
il-15 response (figure 4b). differences between il-2 and il-15 in
their ability to regulate cell size were not attributed to differences in

il-2 and il-15 differentially regulate protein synthesis

the ability of il-2, but not il-15, to maintain the protein content of
antigen-activated t cells could be explained if these 2 cytokines
could differentially regulate endogenous amino acid uptake and the
de novo synthesis of protein. initially, the ability of cytokinetreated t cells to incorporate a tritium-labeled amino acid mixture
was used to quantify rates of amino acid uptake. the data in figure
4a show that an antigen-activated t cell could not autonomously
maintain amino acid uptake when cultured in medium alone. il-2
and il-15 were able to induce dose-dependent increases in amino
acid uptake in antigen-activated t cells, but, strikingly, amino acid
uptake in il-2–activated cells was approximately double that of

their abilities to initiate dna synthesis and cell-cycle progression.
hence, il-2 and il-15 were equivalent mitogens (figure 1a), and
the frequency of cells in the proliferative (s and g2) phases of the
cell cycle was comparable in il-2– and il-15–cultured, antigenprimed t cells (23% and 11% vs 23% and 14%, respectively)
(figure 4c).
il-2 and il-15 differentially regulate expression of transferrin
receptor cd71 and amino acid transporter subunit cd98

amino acid uptake in hematopoietic cells is regulated by amino
acid transporter complexes that include cd98 (42f) as a key
component.40-43 therefore, we assessed whether differences in the
ability of il-2 and il-15 to regulate amino acid uptake were
explained by differences in their ability to regulate cd98 expression. in addition, the uptake of amino acids is an energy-dependent
process, and optimal growth responses in cytokine-stimulated
lymphocytes are associated with the up-regulation of transferrin
receptors that deliver iron, a necessary cofactor for a number of
crucial metabolic reactions, to the cell interior. accordingly, we
compared the effect of il-2 and il-15 on the expression of cd71,
the transferrin receptor. the data in figure 5a show that antigenactivated cd8⫹ t cells maintained in il-2 had high levels of
surface cd98 compared with cells cultured with no cytokine
(medium control). similarly, antigen-activated t cells maintained
in il-2 expressed high levels of transferrin receptor (cd71), but
these levels declined rapidly when cells were cultured in medium
alone (figure 5b). the data show that levels of cd98 and
transferrin receptors in t cells maintained in il-15 were reduced
compared with t cells cultured with il-2 (figure 5a-b). the level
of transferrin receptor expression in t cells cultured with il-15 for
24 or 48 hours was also lower than in t cells cultured in the
presence of il-2. t cells cultured in il-15 did not globally
down-regulate all surface receptors: levels of l-selectin (cd62l)
and common ␥ chain cytokine receptor subunit increased over 24 to

role of pi3k in il-2 regulation of protein synthesis
and t-cell growth

cd98 expression in the  xxxg1177xxx –responsive hematopoietic pro–b-cell
line fl5.12 is controlled by the serine kinase akt or protein
kinase b (pkb), which is activated by phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)
triphosphate (ptdins(3,4,5)p3), the lipid product of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (pi3ks).40 moreover, an evolutionarily conserved
pathway for the regulation of cell metabolism and growth by pi3k
is mediated by the  xxxg1377xxx  phospholipid-dependent
kinase 1 (pdk1), which regulates the activity of pkb/akt and the
70-kda  xxxg1987xxx  ( xxxg1989xxx ).44-46 the importance of
pdk1 for the regulation of t-cell size has been explored in
transgenic mouse models. accordingly, t-cell–specific deletion of
pdk1 has an immediate impact on thymocyte growth and results in
reduced cell size in proliferating pre–t cells.46 conversely, expression of a constitutively active membrane-targeted pkb in t cells of
transgenic mice causes an increase in t-cell size.47
we considered the possibility that differences between il-2 and
il-15 in their ability to regulate cd98 expression, amino acid
uptake, and protein synthesis reflected differences between them in
their ability to induce pi3k/pdk1/pkb signaling. to test this
hypothesis, we first assessed whether cd98 expression on t cells is
regulated by pi3k. figure 6a shows cd98 levels are markedly
reduced when il-2–cultured antigen-activated cd8⫹ t cells are
treated with a pharmacologic inhibitor of pi3k  xxxd2523xxx  (ly).
cd71 expression is also reduced in il-2–activated t cells cultured
with  xxxd2523xxx  (figure 6b). the impact of  xxxd2523xxx  on the
ability of il-2 to sustain t-cell growth and cell size was also
examined. the data in figure 6c show the fsc profile of
antigen-activated t cells maintained in il-2 in the presence or
absence of  xxxd2523xxx . il-2–activated t cells treated with  xxxd2523xxx 
are smaller than cells exposed to il-2 alone. the data (figure
6d-e) also show that  xxxd2523xxx  inhibited il-2–induced amino
acid uptake and incorporation into cellular protein. the protein
content of il-2–activated cells was reduced approximately 2- to
3-fold by  xxxd2523xxx  treatment, though it was not reduced to the
lower level of protein present in t cells cultured with no cytokine
(figure 6f). in subsequent experiments, the impact of  xxxd2523xxx 
on il-15–induced protein synthesis was examined. the data show
that  xxxd2523xxx  inhibited il-15–induced cellular amino acid uptake
(figure 6g); cell size was correspondingly reduced (data not
shown). il-2 and il-15 were potent survival factors for antigenprimed cd8⫹ t cells, and in many cells pi3k signals were crucial
regulators of survival responses. il-2– and il-15–cultured t cells
did not die in the presence of  xxxd2523xxx  but persisted as small,
rounded cells (figure 6c).  xxxd2523xxx  thus blocked t-cell growth
but not survival. moreover, the effects of  xxxd2523xxx  were reversible: t cells cultured with il-2 plus  xxxd2523xxx  for 2 days could
regain cell size and proliferate if they were washed free of drug and
were recultured with il-2 (data not shown).

the results in figure 6 show that t-cell size and pi3k-sensitive
pathways in t cells regulate amino acid transporters and uptake.
hence, differences between il-2 and il-15 in their ability to
regulate cell growth could reflect that il-2 and il-15 differ in their
ability to induce or sustain pi3k signaling. the downstream
effector of pi3k in terms of cell growth regulation is the
pdk1/pkb pathway, and a sensitive and quantitative method to
monitor this pathway is to analyze phosphorylation of the ribosomal s6 subunit by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular

staining with specific phospho-s6 antisera.46 s6 phosphorylation is
mediated by  xxxg1989xxx , which requires phosphorylation by pdk1 if it
is to be functional. s6 phosphorylation is also regulated by another
pdk1 substrate, pkb, through tsc-1/2–mediated regulation of
 xxxg1989xxx  function.48 flow cytometric analysis of phospho-s6 thus
examines phosphorylation in the single cells of a downstream
target of pi3k/pdk1/pkb/ xxxg1989xxx  pathways if considerable signal
amplification has occurred.
the results in figure 7a show that ex vivo naive cd8⫹ t cells

dramatically increase phospho-s6 levels after stimulation with
lcmv gp33-41 peptide for 2 days. these high levels of phospho-s6 are lost if cells are removed from antigen and are cultured
in medium alone (figure 7b, top). phospho-s6 levels are maintained when antigen-activated t cells are cultured with il-2
(figure 7b, middle), and this il-2 response is dependent on the
activation of pi3k because the coculture of t cells with il-2 and
the pi3k inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  abrogates phospho-s6 staining
(figure 7c). comparison of il-2 and il-15 regulation of the
phospho-s6 pathway showed an equal ability to sustain s6
phosphorylation at an early 6-hour time point (figure 7b, left).
however, during prolonged exposure to cytokine, only il-2
maintained high levels of phospho-s6, whereas the il-15 response
was more transient (figure 7b). thus, t cells maintained in il-15
for 12 to 24 hours have markedly lower levels of phospho-s6 than
cells maintained in il-2. it should be emphasized that phospho-s6
levels in t cells cultured in il-15 are higher than those seen in cells
cultured in medium alone but are considerably lower than cells
cultured in il-2 (figure 7b).
we considered the possibility that the difference between il-2
and il-15 in terms of their ability to regulate the phosphorylation
of s6 protein reflected that cd8⫹ t cells maintained in il-15 had
lower levels of the substrate s6 protein than cells grown in il-2. to
explore this possibility, we examined the ability of t cells
maintained in il-2 or il-15 to induce s6 phosphorylation in
response to pharmacologic stimulation with the  xxxd2925xxx 
pdbu. the data in figure 7d show that the levels of phospho-s6 in
pdbu-treated cells maintained in il-2 or il-15 are comparable.
hence, t cells maintained in il-15 or il-2 have similar levels of s6
phosphorylation when activated pharmacologically and, thus, similar levels of total s6 protein.

regulation of il-2 and il-15 receptors

differences in the kinetics of il-2 and il-15 induction of
phospho-s6 reveal that il-15 initiates more transient signaling
pathways than il-2 in cd8⫹ t cells. a predominant mechanism
used by t cells to terminate cytokine signaling is to regulate surface
expression of cytokine receptors.5,49,50 the high-affinity binding of
il-2 is mediated by a complex consisting of the common cytokine

cornish et al

receptor ␥ chain (␥c),  xxxg1175xxx  (the  xxxg1175xxx ␤ chain), and cd25 (the
unique  xxxg1175xxx ␣ chain). il-15 interacts with cells by binding to the
unique il-15r␣ subunit, which presents il-15 in trans to ␥c and ␤
( xxxg1175xxx ) subunits present on nearby cells.3,4 il-2 binding to its
receptor triggers receptor internalization and ligand degradation
but simultaneously up-regulates the expression of cd25,51 thereby
preventing receptor down-regulation and allowing activated t cells
to sustain proliferative and growth responses to il-2. in contrast,
exposure to il-15 is reported to down-regulate the expression of
high-affinity il-15 receptors with a resultant loss of il-15
responsiveness.52
to examine the possibility that il-15 down-regulated expression of the il-15r␣ subunit in antigen-primed cd8⫹ mouse t
cells, flow cytometry was used to quantify il-15r and  xxxg1175xxx 
subunits on the surfaces of antigen-activated t cells maintained in
medium alone or in the presence of 20 ng/ml il-2 or il-15.
surface levels of cd25, the unique  xxxg1175xxx ␣ chain, were markedly
up-regulated when antigen-activated cd8⫹ t cells were grown in
il-2 rather than media alone (figure 8a). il-15 was not as potent
as il-2 at maintaining  xxxg1175xxx  levels, but it still stimulated cd25
expression when compared with media alone. activated cd8⫹ t
cells also expressed il-15r␣, but surface levels of this receptor
were not maintained in the presence of il-15 (figure 8b). il-15r␣
chain expression was relatively high in antigen-activated t cells
cultured in media alone or in il-2 but was relatively low in cells
stimulated with il-15. hence, il-2 and il-15 differed in the way
they regulated the expression of their receptors: il-2 triggered a
positive feedback mechanism that up-regulated expression of the
 xxxg1175xxx ␣ subunit, the key receptor subunit for high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx 
expression. conversely, levels of il-15r␣ chain declined in cd8⫹
t cells cultured with il-15.

discussion
il-2 and il-15 are potent mitogens for antigen-stimulated cd8⫹ t
cells but differentially control t-cell differentiation. these 2
cytokines also have a differential impact when used therapeutically

to modify immune responses. the present study provides some
new insights into why il-2 and  xxxg1165xxx  differentially regulate t-cell
function by revealing that these cytokines are strikingly distinct in
their ability to control protein synthesis and t-cell size. il-2 and
il-15 are thus equivalent mitogens for antigen-stimulated cd8⫹ t
cells, but they are not equivalent growth factors. antigen-activated
cd8⫹ t cells are large blastoid cells, but they cannot autonomously
maintain their size and are unable to maintain amino acid incorporation or de novo protein synthesis without exogenous cytokine
stimulation. il-2 and il-15 are able to induce protein synthesis in
antigen-activated t cells, but protein synthesis rates in il-2–
activated cells are approximately 2-fold those in il-15–stimulated
cells. the differential action of il-2 and il-15 on amino acid
uptake and protein synthesis is associated with differences in the
ability of these 2 cytokines to maintain surface levels of the amino
acid transporter subunit cd98. il-2 can induce high levels of
cd98 expression and amino acid uptake in contrast to the relatively
weak effects of il-15. the difference in the ability of il-2 and
il-15 to induce protein synthesis is approximately 2-fold. this may
not seem like a huge difference, but il-2 and il-15 are potent and
equivalent mitogens, and a 2-fold difference in protein synthesis in
rapidly dividing cells quickly translates to a significant difference
in the size of daughter cells and their subsequent progeny.
il-15 can sustain mitosis and t-cell clonal expansion without
maintaining t cells the size of il-2. hence, the level of cell growth
induced by il-2 exceeds that required for mitosis and may be more
relevant to its ability to sustain the synthesis and production of
effector molecules in cytotoxic t cells. the differential effect of
il-2 and il-15 on general protein synthesis may resolve the puzzle
of how il-2 and il-15 differentially direct cd8⫹ t-cell fate,30,31
even though they initially activate common signal transduction
pathways and induce similar patterns of gene transcription.24,25 the
differentiation of effector ctl takes several days. to sustain the
production of cytokines or cytotoxic mediators, effector lymphocytes will have to maintain high rates of cell metabolism for a
prolonged period. a sustained 2-fold difference in protein synthesis
over a period of many hours or days would considerably diminish
the ability of activated t cells to produce and secrete effector
cytokines and chemokines with profound consequences for t-cell
differentiation. the power of il-2 in terms of its ability to induce
protein synthesis could thus explain why it is required for t-cell
expansion to be sustained in vivo even though it is not essential to
initiate t-cell cycle progression.10,28 moreover, it gives some
insight into why this cytokine may have a unique role in vivo as a
regulator of peripheral immune homeostasis.8 in particular, the
potency of il-2 in terms of its ability to drive protein synthesis
could explain why antigen-stimulated t cells fail to secrete effector
cytokines in the absence of il-2 even though they appear to
undergo normal cell division.12
the present data show that the ability of t cells to maintain
protein synthesis is driven by constant signal input because the
removal of cytokine immediately abrogates amino acid uptake and
amino acid incorporation into proteins. the differential actions of
il-2 and il-15 on amino acid uptake and t-cell growth correlates
with the differential kinetics of the pi3k/pdk1 signaling pathway
stimulated by these cytokines. hence, in antigen-activated t cells,
il-2 and il-15 stimulate pi3k/pdk1-mediated signal transduction
pathways that culminate in the phosphorylation of the ribosomal s6
subunit. initially, the il-2 and il-15 responses are equivalent in
magnitude, but there is a significant difference in the prolonged
response to these 2 cytokines. il-2 has the capacity to sustain pi3k
signaling at high levels, whereas il-15 only transiently induces

differential regulation of t-cell growth

high levels of pi3k signaling and, during a sustained response,
gives a low level of s6 phosphorylation. the major difference
between il-2 and il-15 signaling to pkb and  xxxg1989xxx  is thus
temporal and quantitative.
why is il-15 activation of the s6 pathway transient while the
il-2 response is sustained? we would exclude that il-15 upregulates a negative feedback pathway that globally antagonizes
pi3k signals because t cells maintained in il-15 can immediately
up-regulate s6 phosphorylation and increase cell size if re-exposed
to il-2. it is possible that the different kinetics of il-2 and il-15
signaling result from differences in the way these cytokines are
presented to t cells. il-2 binds as a soluble ligand, whereas il-15
is thought to be presented in trans by the il-15r␣ subunit to ␤/␥
subunits on neighboring cells.3,4 the signal strength delivered by
il-15 presented in trans may be lower than that delivered by de
novo binding of il-2 to its trimeric receptor complex. however, an
explanation for the relative transience of the il-15/s6 response
compared with the il-2 sustained response also resides in differences in the way these 2 cytokines can modulate the expression of
their own receptors. il-2 signaling is sustained because il-2
up-regulates the expression of its ␣ subunit, which replenishes
surface levels of high-affinity il-2 receptors that are then available
for occupancy by additional il-2 molecules. hence, during the
sustained response to il-2, new il-2/ xxxg1175xxx  complexes are constantly formed.5,49,51 in contrast, il-15r levels have been shown to
decline during continued exposure to il-15, thus reducing the
number of available il-15rs during sustained exposure to cytokine.52 in this respect, il-15r regulation is reminiscent of  xxxg1183xxx 
signaling whereby  xxxg1183xxx  exposure results in the down-regulation of
il-7r expression as a mechanism to prevent t cells from competing for limited quantities of cytokine once the appropriate cell
response has been stimulated.50
il-2 and il-15 induce different biologic functions in t cells in
which il-2 promotes the differentiation of effector cytotoxic t
lymphocyte (ctl), whereas il-15 promotes memory t-cell development.1,53 in addition, il-15 is increasingly considered to be
superior to il-2 for immunotherapy regarding dose toxicity. are
the different biologic actions of il-2 and il-15 explained by
temporally quantitative differences in signal transduction by these

607

cytokines? data that support this theory include the fact that low
doses of il-2 mimic il-15 and induce the differentiation of
memory t cells rather than effector ctls.29 it is also known that
low doses of il-2 are more valuable immunotherapeutically than
high doses.54 the relevance of these data to the present study is that
low doses of il-2 result in transient signaling because activated t
cells consume (ie, internalize and degrade) il-2 and at low doses
rapidly deplete the cytokine from culture medium, making it
available only transiently to the t-cell population.
in summary, the present study demonstrates that cytokines that
are equivalent mitogens can have different potency for regulating
t-cell growth or protein synthesis. il-2 and il-15 perform very
different actions as inducers of protein synthesis and t-cell growth,
though they are equivalent in their ability to drive t-cell cycle
progression. the differences between il-2 and il- 15 are explained
by temporal differences in signaling that translate into differences
in protein synthesis. in particular, the ability of il-2 to sustain high
levels of pi3k/pdk1 signal transduction allows this cytokine to
sustain t-cell protein synthesis at high levels for a prolonged
period. the differential effects of il-2 and il-15 on t-cell protein
synthesis can promote rational decisions in choosing il-2 rather
than il-15 for immunotherapy. il-2 is useful for short-term
expansion of potent effector t cells but is less valuable for immune
replenishment because it promotes more protein synthesis than
needed for t-cell mitosis. this is beneficial in the short term but it
demands great energy, which may explain why t cells cultured in
il-2 are susceptible to apoptosis. il-15 appears to more closely
match levels of protein synthesis to mitosis and would be the
cytokine of choice for efficient proliferative expansion of t cells.
