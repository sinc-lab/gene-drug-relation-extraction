differential trace amine alterations in individuals receiving acetylenic inhibitors of mao-a ( xxxd1730xxx ) or mao-b (selegiline and  xxxd2850xxx ).  marked, dose-dependent elevations in the urinary excretion of phenylethylamine, para-tyramine, and meta-tyramine were observed in depressed patients treated for three or more weeks with 10, 30, or 60 mg/day of the partially-selective inhibitor of mao-b, selegiline (l-deprenyl). in comparative studies with other, structurally similar acetylenic inhibitors of mao,  xxxd2850xxx , an mao-b > mao-a inhibitor used in doses of 90 mg/day for three or more weeks, produced elevations in these trace amines which were similar to those found with the highest dose of selegiline studied.  xxxd1730xxx , a selective inhibitor of mao-a used in doses of 30 mg/day for three or more weeks (a dose/time regimen previously reported to reduce urinary, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (mhpg) > 80%, indicating a marked inhibitory effect on mao-a in humans in vivo) produced negligible changes in trace amine excretion. in comparison to recent studies of individuals lacking the genes for mao-a, mao-b, or both mao-a and mao-b, the lack of change in trace amine excretion in individuals with a mutation affecting only mao-a is in agreement with the observed lack of effect of  xxxd1730xxx  in the present study. selegiline produced larger changes in trace amines--at least at the higher doses studied--than found in individuals lacking the gene for mao-b, in agreement with other data suggesting a lesser selectivity for mao-b inhibition when selegiline was given in doses higher than 10 mg/day. overall, trace amine elevations in individuals receiving the highest dose of deprenyl or receiving  xxxd2850xxx  were approximately three to five-fold lower than the elevations observed in individuals lacking the genes for both mao-a and mao-b, suggesting that these drug doses yield incomplete inhibition of mao-a and mao-b.
