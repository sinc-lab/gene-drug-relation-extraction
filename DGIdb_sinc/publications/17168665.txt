abstract: the expression and activity of  xxxg765xxx  ( xxxg765xxx ; the sole enzyme capable of the reductive de novo
synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx  from acetyl-coa, malonyl-coa, and  xxxd3210xxx  –
nadph-) is extremely low in nearly all nonmalignant adult tissues, whereas it is significantly up-regulated or activated in
many cancer types, thus creating the potential for a large therapeutic index. since the pioneering observation that inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity by the mycotoxin  xxxd463xxx  preferentially kills cancer cells and retards the growth of tumors in
xenografts models, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the potential of  xxxg765xxx  as a target for antineoplastic intervention. other  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors such as the  xxxd463xxx  derivative c75, the -lactone orlistat, the green tea polyphenol  xxxd2006xxx  (egcg) and other naturally occurring flavonoids (i.e., luteolin, quercetin, and
kaempferol), as well as the antibiotic triclosan, have been identified and have been shown to limit cancer cell growth by
inducing apoptotic cell death. though the exact mode of action of these  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors is under discussion, it has been
revealed that depletion of end-product  xxxd2154xxx , toxic intracellular accumulation of supra-physiological concentrations
of the  xxxg765xxx  substrate malonyl-coa and/or limited membrane synthesis and/or functioning by altered production of
phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid raft-aggregates), can explain, at least in
part, the cytostatic, cytotoxic as well as the apoptotic effects occurring upon pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity
in cancer cells. moreover, several cancer-associated molecular features including nonfunctioning p53, overexpression of
the  xxxg721xxx  ( xxxg682xxx -2) oncogene, and hyperactivation of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k down-stream effector protein kinase b (akt), appear to determine an exacerbated sensitivity to  xxxg765xxx  inhibition-induced cancer cell death. although few of these inhibitors are expected to be “exclusively” selective for  xxxg765xxx , the potential of  xxxg765xxx  as a target for antineoplastic intervention
has eventually been confirmed by rna interference (rnai)-knockdown of  xxxg765xxx . certainly, future studies should definitely elucidate the ultimate biochemical link between  xxxg765xxx  inhibition and cancer cell death. although the combination
of  xxxg765xxx  structural complexity and until recently the lack of x-ray crystallography data of mammalian  xxxg765xxx  created a
significant challenge in the exploitation of  xxxg765xxx  as a valuable target for drug development, it is hoped that the improvement in the selectivity and potency of forthcoming novel  xxxg765xxx -targeted small molecule inhibitors by taking advantage,
for instance, of the recent 4.5 å resolution x-ray crystallographic map of mammalian  xxxg765xxx , will direct the foundation of
a new family of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer history.

i. introduction
i.1.  xxxg765xxx  ( xxxg765xxx ): a novel target for
drug development
de novo synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx  in the cytosol of animal
cells is carried out by the 250- to 270-kd multifunctional,
homodimeric  xxxg765xxx  ( xxxg765xxx ) [1-6].  xxxg765xxx  consists of two identical multifunctional polypeptides, in which
three catalytic domains in the n-terminal section (-ketoacyl

synthase (ks), malonyl/acetyltransferase (mat), and dehydrase (dh)), are separated by a core region of 600 residues
from four c-terminal domains (enoyl reductase (er), ketoacyl reductase (kr), acyl carrier protein (acp) and
thioesterase (te); (fig. (1a,b)).  xxxg765xxx  synthesizes longchain  xxxd2154xxx , mainly palmitate, de novo from the substrates acetyl-coa, malonyl-coa, and nadph through its
six active sites, i.e., mat, ks, kr, dh, er and te:

fig. (1). schematic representation of two models for organization of  xxxg765xxx  enzymatic complex and target sites of chemical  xxxg765xxx 
blockers. a. in the conventional model,  xxxg765xxx  enzymatic complex contains seven separate enzymatic pockets as a head-to-tail dimer with
the ks and mat domains of one monomer working together with the de, er, kr, acp, and te domains of the adjacent monomer. that is,
two  xxxg765xxx  monomers in the homodimeric form of the enzyme are arranged in a fully extended antiparallel orientation allowing functional
interactions across the monomer interface. this conventional model for organization of  xxxg765xxx  is largely based on the observation that the
bifunctional reagent 1,3-dibromopropanone (dbp) is able to cross-link the active site cysteine thiol of the ks domain in one  xxxg765xxx  monomer
with the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of the acp domain in the other monomer [4]. b. a revised model for  xxxg765xxx  organization has
been proposed by asturias et al. [4]. this alternative model predicts that the ks and mat domains of both monomers lie closer to the center
of the  xxxg765xxx  dimer, where they can access the acp of either subunit. maier et al. [5] recently revealed the architecture of mammalian  xxxg765xxx 
at 4.5 å resolution, which fundamentally agrees with the asturias´ revised model and demonstrate that mammalian  xxxg765xxx  is, indeed, an intertwined dimer with a large dimerization interface running through the body of the molecule, perpendicular to the interfaced proposed in the
classical scheme.  xxxg765xxx  blockers: 1:  xxxd463xxx ; 2: c75; 3: egcg and other naturally occurring  xxxd1979xxx  compounds; 4: orlistat and

reduction, to the saturated acyl derivative, which then acts as
a primer for further elongation and reduction cycles to yield
ultimately a  xxxd2832xxx  derivative. the latter is hydrolyzed by
te to free palmitate (fig. (2)).
since the  xxxg765xxx  substrate malonyl-coa, in addition to
functioning as the carbon source for  xxxg765xxx -catalyzed fatty
acid synthesis, is now recognized as an important signaling
molecule involved in metabolic fuel sensing and appetite
control, inhibitors of  xxxg765xxx  activity inducing elevated malonyl-coa levels represent a promising class of reagents for
the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [7-13]. indeed,
some  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors have shown potential for weight reduction in animal models, though their exact mechanism of

action is until under discussion. moreover,  xxxg765xxx  blockade,
either with naturally occurring or semi-synthetic chemical
inhibitors or by rna interference, induces apoptosis in cancer cells, making  xxxg765xxx  a valuable target for the development of anticancer chemotherapeutical agents [14-23]. of
note, in the last year more than 50 papers have been published in the field of tumoral lipogenesis. here, we will
overview our current perspective on the use of  xxxg765xxx  blockers as attractive agents for antineoplastic intervention.

fig. (2). schematic diagram showing enzymatic steps involved in  xxxg765xxx -catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis that leads to
 xxxd2833xxx .  xxxg765xxx  is comprised of six enzymatic domains and an acyl-carrier protein (acp). the steps in fatty acid biosynthesis are as
follows. (i) the mat domain (1) transfers an acetyl group onto the acp. it is then translocated to the active-site cysteine by ks (2). this
position also serves as the loading position for the growing acyl chain in subsequent interactions. (ii) the mat domain (1) then transfers a
second malonyl group to the acp, and the two are condensed (2) into a four-carbon product bound to the enzyme through the thiol group of
the acp. (iii) the kr (3) reduces the ketone at c-3 to an alcohol. (iv) the dh (4) further reduces the alcohol to an alkene. (v) the er (5)
further reduces the alkene bond to an alkane, and the acp-bound chain is translocated back to the active-site cysteine (2). steps ii-iv are then
repeated six times to yield a 16-carbon, fully saturated  xxxd2833xxx  bound to the acp. (vi) the palmitate is released from  xxxg765xxx  by the enzyme’s intrinsic te (6).

energy storage compounds and messenger substances [1423]. furthermore, endogenous synthesized  xxxd2154xxx  act as
post-translational protein modifiers and modulate gene expression. in humans,  xxxg765xxx , the sole enzyme capable of the
reductive de novo synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx  from
acetyl-coa, malonyl-coa, and nadph, is highly expressed
in liver, adipose tissue, and lactating mammary gland [1423]. nevertheless, in adults  xxxg765xxx  has been considered an
enzyme of minor importance since exogenous saturated fatty
acids are abundantly available through diet. that is,  xxxg765xxx 
activity in normal cells and tissues is significantly downregulated and compensated with dietary  xxxd2154xxx . interestingly, extremely high levels of  xxxg765xxx  are expressed in premalignant, invasive and metastatic lesions of many human
epithelial cancers [14-23]. this difference in expression and
activity of fas between normal and tumors cells provides an
attractive approach to cancer therapy having the potential for
a large therapeutic index. indeed, the tumoricidal activity of
chemical fas inhibitors has begun to emerge.
ii.  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors
ii.1.  xxxd463xxx 
 xxxd463xxx  [(2r, 3s), 2-3-epoxy-4-oxo-7, 10-trans, transdodecadienamide], a natural product derived from the fungus
cephalosporum caerulens (fig. (3)), has been known since
the 1960s as a potent non-competitive inhibitor of fasncatalyzed fa synthesis [24, 25].  xxxd463xxx  irreversibly in-

hibits the enzyme  xxxg765xxx  by binding covalently to the active
site cysteine of the ks moiety, which performs the condensation reaction between the elongation fatty acid chain and
each successive acetyl or malonyl residue, causing complete
 xxxg765xxx  inactivation [26].  xxxd463xxx -induced  xxxg765xxx  blockade
leads to selective cytotoxicity of cancer cells in vitro by triggering apoptosis, and it results in significantly delayed disease progression and in increased survival in human cancer
xenografts [14, 27-30]. unfortunately, the clinical relevance
of these results is limited because  xxxd463xxx  is chemically
unstable because harbors a very reactive epoxy group that
may interact also with other proteins and may affect processes other than  xxxg765xxx  activity including palmitoylation (a
posttranslational modification allowing key signaling proteins to attach to the plasma membrane), cholesterol synthesis and/or proteolysis [31-35].
ii.2. c75
a novel  xxxd463xxx -derived synthetic  xxxg765xxx  inhibitor has
recently become available. c75 (trans-4-carboxy-5-octyl-3methylenebutyrolactone) lacks the reactive epoxide present
in  xxxd463xxx  (fig. (3)), enhancing both chemical stability and
specificity [36]. c75 inhibits purified mammalian  xxxg765xxx 
activity with characteristics of a slow-binding inhibitor, and,
similarly to  xxxd463xxx , induces cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in cultured cells by blocking the ks domain of  xxxg765xxx 
[36]. importantly, we recently demonstrated that specific

486 current pharmaceutical biotechnology, 2006, vol. 7, no. 6

depletion of cancer-associated  xxxg765xxx  by rnai causes a loss
of sensitivity to c75, thus confirming that c75-induced cytotoxic damage to cancer cells is closely dependent on its ability to inhibit  xxxg765xxx  enzymatic activity [37, 38]. c75 treatment has been shown to induce significant anti-tumor activity in human breast, endometrial, prostate, ovary and mesothelioma cancer cell lines and xenografts [36, 39-45]. c75
treatment concomitantly inhibited endogenous fatty acid
synthesis in tumor and normal liver but, importantly, no adverse effects were observed on other proliferating cellular
compartments such as bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract,
skin or lymphoid tissues.

fig. (3). structural differences and similarities between  xxxd463xxx  [(2s, 3r) 2,3-epoxy-4-oxo-7e, 10e-dodecadienamide] and
c75 (trans-4-carboxy-5-octyl-3-methylenebutyrolactone). although c75 lacks the highly reactive  xxxd463xxx ´s epoxide moiety, it
retains the 8-carbon lipid tail without the two double bonds [36].

ii.3.  xxxd2006xxx  (egcg) and other
naturally occurring polyphenols
c75 treatment robustly induces rapid and profound
weight loss and loss of adipose mass by affecting food intake
and energy expenditure [46]. this “side-effect” of c75 is due
to its interaction with two targets in lipid metabolism:  xxxg765xxx 
and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt-1), the ratelimiting enzyme for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation [46].
cpt-1 esterifies carnitine to long-chain fatty acyl-coas,
thus permitting their entry into the mitochondria for fatty
acid oxidation and energy production. malonyl-coa, both a
substrate for  xxxg765xxx  and an allosteric inhibitor of cpt-1, prevents the oxidation of newly synthesized  xxxd2154xxx  formed
during de novo fatty acid biogenesis. interestingly, c75 not
only inhibits  xxxg765xxx  but further stimulates cpt-1, even in the
presence of inhibitory levels of malonyl-coa. therefore,
c75 inhibits  xxxg765xxx  while leading to an increase in malonylcoa but preventing malonyl-coa-mediated inhibition of
cpt-1. although this non-physiological alteration of fatty
acid metabolism might be the key to the anorectic and antitumoral effects of c75 [19, 46], it is obvious that searches
for additional antagonists of cancer-associated  xxxg765xxx  with
better selectivity and distinct mechanisms of actions are warranted.
the green tea component egcg has recently been
shown to act, similarly to  xxxd463xxx  and c75, as a potent inhibitor of  xxxg765xxx  activity in chicken liver extracts through a

lupu and menendez

competitive inhibition of nadph for the same binding site
in the ks domain of  xxxg765xxx  [47-49]. interestingly, the high
levels of  xxxg765xxx  activity in cancer cells can be dosedependently inhibited by egcg and this inhibition parallels
decreased endogenous fatty acid synthesis, inhibition of cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis [50-52]. conversely, egcg treatment of non-malignant cells exhibiting
low levels of  xxxg765xxx  activity leads to a decrease in growth
rate but not to induction of apoptosis. these findings establishing egcg as a potent natural inhibitor of  xxxg765xxx  may
provide a molecular basis underlying the inhibitory actions
of green tea against human cancer xenografts. in addition,
egcg-induced  xxxg765xxx  blockade may explain, at least in part,
the correlation between frequent consumption of green tea
(rich in egcg and egcg-related  xxxd1979xxx  catechins)
and the lower incidence and the improved prognosis of several human carcinomas [50-52].
brusselmans et al. recently analyzed the anti-lipogenic
effects of a panel of 18 naturally occurring  xxxd1979xxx 
compounds and showed that luteolin, quercetin and
kaempferol were the most potent inhibitors of lipogenesis
(via blockade of the enzymatic activity of  xxxg765xxx ) in intact
prostate and breast cancer cells followed by apigenin, taxifolin and egcg [53]. moreover, the anti-lipogenic effect of
these compounds was strongly associated with their ability to
arrest growth and induce apoptosis of prostrate and breast
cancer cells, indicating that  xxxg765xxx  inhibition may be at least
one of the mechanisms by which flavonoids exert their anticarcinogenic effects. these findings were in accordance with
recently published data showing that several flavonoids (including luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol) inhibit the activity of purified  xxxg765xxx , with a comparable order or inhibitory
potencies (i.e., luteolin > quercetin > kaempferol) [47, 49].
with regard to the structure-activity relationships of flavonoids, brusselmans et al. concluded that the presence of a c2, 3 double bond, a 4-ketone function, and hydroxyl groups
on positions 5, 7, 3’ and 4’ favor the potential of flavonoids
to inhibit lipid synthesis in intact cells ([53]; fig. (4a,b)).
wang et al. previously demonstrated that the presence of a
galloyl moiety was essential for  xxxg765xxx  inhibition by catechins [47, 49]. in their hands, only egcg and epicatechin3-gallate (ecg), but not epicatechin (ec) or epigallocatechin (egc) inhibited  xxxg765xxx  activity in vitro. in addition,
they also observed that both egcg and ecg showed irreversible slow binding activity, whereas other flavonoids (including quercetin and kaempferol) only showed reversible
fast binding inhibition of  xxxg765xxx , thereby suggesting that
egcg and ecg may inhibit lipogenesis by different mechanisms than other flavonoids.
ii.4. orlistat (xenical™)
the us food and drug administration (fda)-approved
anti-obesity drug orlistat ( xxxd2792xxx ; marketed by
roche as xenical™), an irreversible inhibitor of pancreatic
and gastric lipases, is a recently discovered selective inhibitor of  xxxg765xxx  activity ([54-58]; fig. (5)). unlike  xxxd463xxx 
and c75 that inhibit the ks domain of fas, the -lactone
orlistat elicits its effect inhibiting the te domain of  xxxg765xxx ,
which is responsible for releasing the end-product palmitate
from the acp of the enzyme [54]. specifically, orlistat inhibits  xxxg765xxx  in intact cells with no effect on the abundance

fig. (4). molecular structure of egcg and other naturally occurring  xxxd1979xxx  compounds. a. the molecular structure of flavonoids
consists of two aromatic rings (a ring and b ring), that are linked by a three-carbon bridge. wang et al. [47, 49] were pioneers demonstrating
that the presence of a galloyl moiety was essential for  xxxg765xxx  inhibition by catechins. thus, only egcg and ecg (but not ec or egc) inhibited  xxxg765xxx  activity in vitro. in addition, they also observed that both egcg and ecg showed irreversible slow binding activity, whereas other
flavonoids (including quercetin and kaempferol) only showed reversible fast binding inhibition of  xxxg765xxx . b. an analysis of anti-lipogenic
effects on intact cancer cells of a panel of 18  xxxd1979xxx  compounds performed by brusselmans et al. [53], revealed that luteolin, quercetin,
and kaempferol were the most potent inhibitors of  xxxg765xxx -dependent lipogenesis followed by apigenin, taxifolin, and egcg.

of  xxxg765xxx  but rather acting as a tight-binding irreversible inhibitor of the serine hydrolase activity within the te domain
of  xxxg765xxx . remarkably, orlistat-induced  xxxg765xxx  blockade has
demonstrated potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against cultured prostate, breast, colon, stomach and
ovarian cancer cells, with no effect on normal cells [54-58].
orlistat has also been tested in a xenograft mouse model
with the prostate cancer cell line pc-3 and, when compared
with vehicle injection, orlistat treatment significantly prevented the growth of pc-3 xenograft tumors without outward
signs of toxicity [54].
orlistat possesses poor solubility and extremely low oral
bioavailability and it is obvious that a novel formulation will
be required for treating tumors other than those confined to
the gastrointestinal tract. interestingly, orlistat is one of a
class of compounds containing a reactive -lactone. other
compounds in this class include the natural products ebelactones a and b (fig. (5)), some inhibitors of hmg coa synthase, and panclicin d, a synthetic inhibitor of pancreatic
lipase [54]. giving the relatively broad inhibition profile of
ebelactones a and b against serine hydrolases and the demonstration that synthetic routes are available for creation of
variants of orlistat, a more in-depth evaluation of -lactones
as blockers of the serine hydrolase activity present at the te
domain of  xxxg765xxx  is warranted. a very recent practical, catalytic, asymmetric synthesis of -lactones via a sequential
ketene dimerization/hydrogenation process likewise produced several inhibitors of the te domain of  xxxg765xxx  [59].
the best antagonist, a simple phenyl-substituted cis-lactone, displayed an apparent ki (2.5 ± 0.5 mum) of only
10-fold lower than that of orlistat (0.28 ± 0.06 mum).

otic has also been shown to inhibit mammalian and avian
 xxxg765xxx  activity by inhibiting the er activity of the  xxxg765xxx 
multi-enzyme complex [60, 61]. the ability of triclosan at
various concentrations to inhibit growth and reduce the viability of breast cancer cells in culture has recently been
demonstrated [60, 61]. moreover, it has been shown that, at
biologically relevant dose levels, triclosan treatment suppressed rat mammary carcinogenesis by inhibiting  xxxg765xxx 
[62]. importantly, the inhibition of human  xxxg765xxx  by a different mechanism and at a different active site of  xxxg765xxx  that
those previously described for  xxxd463xxx , c75 and orlistat
supports the proposition that inhibition of any of the enzymatic activities of  xxxg765xxx  may be an effective anti-cancer
therapeutic approach. in fact, the er domain within  xxxg765xxx 
multienzymatic complex could be particularly attractive for
the development of novel  xxxg765xxx  antimetabolites as inhibition at this site will increase the concentration of the enoyl
thiolester intermediate, which strikingly resembles both cm55 [63], a synthetic analogue of  xxxd463xxx , and c75 [60]. if
triclosan-induced accumulation of this ,-unsaturated intermediate further leads to the “side-inhibition” of the ks
domain remains to be elucidated (fig. (6)).
iii. molecular mechanisms underlying
anti-tumoral actions of  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors
the fact that specific blockade of  xxxg765xxx  activity significantly attenuates the growth and proliferation of tumor cells
strongly suggest that cancer-associated fas hyperactivity is
vital for the survival of human cancer cells. however, it has
been unresolved the ultimate mechanism underlying the cytostatic, cytotoxic as well as apoptotic effects that occur
upon  xxxg765xxx  blockade in cancer cells.

ii.5. triclosan
triclosan (2,4,4 -trichloro-2 -hydroxydiphenyl ether;
fig. (6)), has been in use for over 30 years as an antibiotic in
soaps mouthwashes and other oral dentifrices. the mechanism of antibiotic action has been identified as the specific
inhibition of type ii enoyl-reductases (er) [60]. this antibi-

of this enzyme and they tested three derivatives of natural products, each containing a -lactone moiety. these are ebelactones a and b, and
 xxxd2792xxx , which is also known as orlistat and is marketed as xenical®. the -lactone can undergo nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the lactone ring by the active site serine of the esterase, yielding a covalent adduct between enzyme and inhibitor. all three
of the compounds inhibited the te activity of  xxxg765xxx  [54], but only orlistat was selective for  xxxg765xxx  in tumor cells.

fig. (6). triclosan and the enoyl-reductase partial activity of  xxxg765xxx . triclosan, a common antibiotic, functions by inhibiting the enoylreductase (er) enzymes of type ii fasns in susceptible bacteria. kinetic studies by liu et al. [60] showed triclosan to be a slow binding
inhibitor of human  xxxg765xxx  and to inhibit the partial activity of the er domain with ic50 values between 10 and 50 mum. additionally, er is a
particularly attractive target within the multifunctional  xxxg765xxx  polypeptide as inhibition at this site will increase the concentration of the enoyl
thiolester intermediate, which resembles the  xxxd463xxx  analogues cm-55 and c75, previously described as blockers of the ks partial activity
of  xxxg765xxx . specific inhibitors of the human  xxxg765xxx  er activity might trigger, therefore, a “domino” inhibiting-effect against  xxxg765xxx  activity.

effects occur despite the presence of exogenous  xxxd2154xxx  in
the culture medium derived from fetal bovine serum. it has
been possible to rescue the cytotoxic effect of chemical
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors on certain cells in fatty acid-free culture
conditions by the addition of palmitate (the primary endproduct of  xxxg765xxx ) or  xxxd2777xxx  (a fa synthesized from
palmitate), whereas exogenous addition of supra-physiological concentrations of non- xxxg765xxx  related  xxxd2154xxx  (e.g.,
-linolenic, docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic, linolenic or
arachidonic  xxxd2154xxx ) failed to reverse  xxxg765xxx  inhibition’s
effects on cancer cell viability [28, 64]. therefore, is does
appear that for unclear reasons, some cancer cells have an
apparent obligatory requirement for  xxxg765xxx -dependent de
novo fatty acid biogenesis for their proliferation and survival
despite the presence of physiological or even supraphysiological levels of exogenous  xxxd2154xxx  in their microenvironment. from a therapeutic perspective, the fact that
only extremely high levels of exogenous  xxxg765xxx -related fatty
acids were partially effective in reversing chemical  xxxg765xxx 
blockers-induced cytotoxicity in vitro implies that tumor
cells should be sensitive to the inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  regardless
of access to circulating plasma lipids [64].
iii.2. toxic accumulation of the  xxxg765xxx  substrate malonyl-coa
as mentioned before, most cancer cells are not rescued
from endogenous fatty acid synthesis inhibition by the pathway end products. thus, it has been unresolved whether the
cytotoxic effect of fatty acid synthesis inhibition on most
cancer cells results from end product starvation or from some
other biochemical mechanism. if fatty starvation is the sole

responsible for the cytotoxic effects of  xxxg765xxx  inhibition,
then any other fatty synthesis inhibitor of similar potency
should produce similar effects. to test this hypothesis, pizer
et al. [39] compared the effects on cancer cells of inhibition
of acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc), the rate-limiting enzyme
for endogenous fatty acid synthesis, with the effects of
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors. in this study, inhibition of endogenous
fatty acid synthesis at the physiologically regulated step of
carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa using the allosteric inhibitor of acc 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid
(tofa) was not cytotoxic to cancer cells.  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors
induced a rapid increase in intracellular malonyl-coa to
several fold above control levels, whereas acc blockade
significantly reduced intracellular malonyl-coa. simultaneous exposure of cancer cells to acc and  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors
resulted in significantly reduced cytotoxicity and apoptosis.
remarkably, the significant antitumor effect of  xxxg765xxx  inhibition on a human breast cancer xenograft in the setting of
physiological levels of ambient  xxxd2154xxx  was similar to the
in vitro result in serum supplemented culture and was consistent with a cytotoxic mechanism independent of fatty acid
starvation. these findings, altogether, strongly suggest that
fatty acid starvation is not a major source of cytotoxicity to
cancer cells upon  xxxg765xxx  inhibition. rather, high levels of the
substrate, malonyl-coa, resulting specifically from inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity, may mediate cytotoxicity of chemical
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors [39, 41, 65].
chajes et al. [66] recently explored the role of acc in
breast cancer cell survival using an rnai approach. they
showed that specific silencing of either the acc or the
 xxxg765xxx  genes in cancer cells resulted in a major decrease in

490 current pharmaceutical biotechnology, 2006, vol. 7, no. 6

 xxxd2833xxx  synthesis. importantly, depletion of the cellular
pool of  xxxd2833xxx  was associated with induction of apoptosis concomitant with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ros) and mitochondrial impairment. brusselmans et
al. [67], also using rnai technology, observed that silencing
of the acc gene resulted in a similar inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis of
highly lipogenic lncap prostate cancer cells as observed
following  xxxg765xxx  rnai. this discrepancy between the effect
of acc gene silencing by specific rnai and the effect of
the chemical acc inhibitor tofa evokes a nonspecific
pleiotropic effect of this agent, affecting pathways other than
fatty acid synthesis, which, in turn, might counteract the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis occurring upon the
specific blockade of endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis.
these findings indicate that accumulation of malonyl-coa is
not a prerequisite for cytotoxicity induced by inhibition of
tumor-associated lipogenesis and suggest that not only
 xxxg765xxx  but in fact all the key enzymes involved in fatty acid
synthesis may represent potential targets for antineoplastic
intervention [21].
iii.3. inhibition of membrane synthesis and/or functioning
although part of the effects of  xxxg765xxx  blockade in cancer
cell survival and proliferation may be induced by the resulting accumulation of the intermediate metabolite malonylcoa, the fact that similar effects have recently been observed when other lipogenic enzymes (i.e., acc, the enzyme
that provides malonyl-coa for fatty acid synthesis; choline
kinase, the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, etc.) were targeted suggests that lipid synthesis per se may be important for cancer cell biology [21].
in this regard, we must take into account that the primary
physiological function of the de novo fatty acid biogenesis
seems to differ between normal and cancer cells [15, 19]. in
liver and adipose tissue,  xxxg765xxx  produces fat from excess
carbon consumed as carbohydrates, which is ultimately
stored as triglycerides. in cancer cells,  xxxg765xxx  might be expressed and synthesized in coordination with increased demand for fatty acid metabolism and/or membrane synthesis
in response to regulated or unregulated cell proliferation. the
bulk of  xxxg765xxx -driven endogenously synthesized  xxxd2154xxx 
are incorporated into membrane lipids by proliferating tumor
cells and, therefore, inhibition of cancer-associated  xxxg765xxx 
activity may limit membrane synthesis and/or functioning
required for cancer cell growth and division. supporting this
notion, it has recently been demonstrated that cancerassociated  xxxg765xxx  is mainly involved in the production of
phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane
microdomains (lipid raft-aggregates) [68]. raft-aggregates,
which are defined as plasma membrane domains enriched
with glycosphingolipids and cholesterol that render them
insoluble to non-ionic detergents, are implicated in key biological processes including signal transduction, intracellular
trafficking, cell polarization and cell migration. many surface receptors are constitutively or inducibly associated with
lipid rafts, and it has been suggested that rafts function as
platforms regulating the induction of signaling pathways.
importantly, clusters of  xxxg721xxx -coded p185her-2/neu oncoprotein, a key oncogenic transducer in many types of human

lupu and menendez

cancers, co-localize with lipid rafts and the lipid environment in the cell membrane of  xxxg721xxx -overexpressing cancer cells profoundly influences the association properties and
biological function of p185her-2/neu [18, 69]. moreover, lipid
rafts are though to regulate the signaling from egfr ( xxxg682xxx ) presumably by altering its kinase activity and changing
the association state of membrane proteins. therefore, it is
likely that  xxxg765xxx  inhibition will result in major changes in
the synthesis of membrane phospholipids which, in turn,
should impair a correct localization and/or functioning of
members of the  xxxg682xxx   xxxg2198xxx  receptor network at the
cellular membrane of tumor cells [69]. for instance,  xxxg765xxx 
inhibition could induce a shift in the equilibrium between
transport of p185her-2/neu to and from the membrane favoring
an increased p185her-2/neu internalization followed by intracellular degradation. to test this hypothesis, we recently characterized the dual regulatory effects of  xxxg765xxx  blockade on
the expression levels of the cell surface-associated p185her2/neu
and of the glycosphingolipid gm1, a lipid-raft marker
[18]. mcf-7/her2-18 cells, a mcf-7-derived clone stably
overexpressing a human full-length  xxxg721xxx  cdna under
the control of a viral sv40 promoter, exhibited a 50% reduction in p185her-2/neu levels at the cell membrane upon c75induced inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity. interestingly,  xxxg765xxx 
inhibition concomitantly impaired the lipid composition of
cell membrane-associated raft-aggregates as evidenced by a
50% reduction in the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate
(fitc)-labeled cholera toxin b subunit, which specifically
binds gm1 [18]. therefore, the impairment of a correct cellular localization of oncoproteins such as p185her-2/neu through
the modification of lipid composition and functioning of the
cancer cell membrane may also account for fas inhibitionrelated cytotoxicity in tumor cells.
iv. molecular markers for sensitivity to
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors
why inhibition of  xxxg765xxx -catalyzed endogenous fatty acid
biogenesis results in specific apoptotic cell death of cancer
cells remains an area of active investigation. nevertheless,
the activity of a number of pathways appears to modulate the
tumoricidal effects of  xxxg765xxx  inhibition.
iv.1. nonfunctioning p53
 xxxg765xxx  inhibition has been shown to be more effective in
initiating apoptosis in cancer cells with nonfunctioning p53,
whereas tumor cells with intact p53 function tend to exhibit a
cytostatic response [38, 40]. although the first and most extensively studied function described for the tumor suppressor
protein p53 was the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis
after dna damage, important roles for p53 have been recognized in the cellular responses to a variety of nongenotoxic metabolic stresses, including hypoxia, acidosis,
and perturbations of rna and protein synthesis. interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity has recently been shown to produce both cytostatic and cytotoxic
effects modulated by p53 in cancer cells [40]. thus,  xxxg765xxx 
blockade produces rapid, potent inhibition of dna replication and s-phase progression, and induces accumulation of
p53 in colon and breast cancer cells [40]. although these
findings suggest that perturbation of  xxxg765xxx  activity is a
novel cellular signaling belonging on the list of metabolic

 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors in cancer treatment

stresses regulated by p53 in cancer cells, it could be also
argue that dna damage might be occurring, either as a direct effect of chemical  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors on dna molecule,
or as a downstream effect of  xxxg765xxx  inhibition. however,
several other observations argue against  xxxg765xxx  inhibitioninduced dna damage. first, li et al. [40] detected no dna
damage in  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors-treated cancer cells by using the
very sensitive in detecting low levels of dna damage single
cell gel electrophoresis (comet) screening assay. second, as
described above,  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors-induced toxicity in tumor
cells appears to be modulated by alterations in pathway activity and/or substrate levels. finally, the toxic effects of
chemical  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors are largely dependent on their
ability to inhibit  xxxg765xxx  as breast cancer cells became insensitive to c75-induced cytotoxicity when  xxxg765xxx  gene expression was specifically silenced by rnai [37, 38]. these observations together demonstrate that inhibition of fasninhibition-induced accumulation of p53 is not related to direct effects of chemical  xxxg765xxx  blockers on dna, thus confirming the important role for p53 in a non-genotoxic metabolic stress such as blockade of endogenous fa metabolism.
the decision between apoptosis and growth arrest following  xxxg765xxx  inhibition is greatly influenced by the status of
p53. first, loss of p53 function substantially increases the
sensitivity of tumor cells to chemical  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors. a
large, dose-dependent increase in apoptosis was observed in
 xxxg765xxx  inhibited rko colon cancer cells rendered p53mutant by stable transfection with a dominant-negative mutant p53 gene [40]. similarly, mcf-7 breast cancer cells
rendered p53-deficient by constitutive expression of the human papilloma virus 16 e6 gene underwent extensive apoptosis within 24 h after  xxxg765xxx  inhibition [40]. accordingly,
we recently characterized wild-type p53 as a key molecular
component of  xxxg765xxx -related cellular signaling by using
rna interference (rnai)-based approach, a powerful new
tool with which to perform loss-of-function genetic screens.
p53 protein levels remained unchanged in c75-treated mcf7 breast cancer cells transiently transfected with a pool of
sequence-specific double-stranded rna oligonucleotides
targeting p53 gene when compared to p53 up-regulation observed in control cells [38]. importantly, rnai-induced silencing of p53 expression together with c75-induced  xxxg765xxx 
blockade resulted in an enhancement of apoptosis that was
significantly higher than the additive value of the two treatments alone. thus, sirna p53 and c75 combined caused 4
times more apoptotic cell death than c75 alone, and up to 30
times more apoptotic cell death than sirna p53 alone [38].
these results, altogether, indicate that  xxxg765xxx  inhibition triggers p53 protein accumulation, which actively limits the
apoptotic effects upon metabolic stress induced by fas inhibition. strikingly, there was no apparent relationship between the p53 mutational status and sensitivity to chemical
fas inhibitor in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines.
however, the degree of p53 mrna expression was predictive of sensitivity to c75-induced cytotoxicity, with lowtp53 mrna expressing breast cancer cells showing hypersensitivity to fas blockade [38]. these findings strongly
suggest that:
a) p53 is a novel molecular sensor of energy imbalance after
the perturbation of endogenous fatty acid metabolism in
breast cancer cells.

current pharmaceutical biotechnology, 2006, vol. 7, no. 6

491

b) p53 function closely influences the decision between
apoptosis and growth arrest following  xxxg765xxx  blockade;
and
c) pharmacological inhibitors of  xxxg765xxx  activity may be
clinically useful against breast carcinomas exhibiting mutation or aberrant expression of p53.
the recent discovery that the  xxxg765xxx  gene is a conserved
p53 family target from worm to human [70], not only reveals
a functional link between these two proteins throughout the
evolution but further supports the relevance of p53 functioning in the response of tumor cells to  xxxg765xxx  blockade.
iv.2. overexpression of the  xxxg721xxx  ( xxxg682xxx -2) oncogene
 xxxg721xxx  overexpression has also been linked to  xxxg765xxx 
inhibition-induced cytotoxicity [18, 44].  xxxg721xxx  (also
called neu and  xxxg682xxx -2) oncogene codes for the transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx  orphan receptor p185her-2/neu and, at
present, represent one of the most important oncogenes in
the etiology, progression, and chemosensitivity of various
types of human malignancies. using a wide panel of human
breast cancer cell lines we previously described that high
levels of both  xxxg765xxx  protein and  xxxg765xxx  enzymatic activity
positively correlate with  xxxg721xxx  gene amplification and/or
 xxxg721xxx  protein overexpression, whereas low to undetectable levels of  xxxg765xxx  correlates with low to undetectable levels [64]. this molecular connection between  xxxg721xxx  and
 xxxg765xxx  was further confirmed by kumar-sinha et al. [71]. to
focus on genes specifically affected by  xxxg721xxx , they made
use of a human mammary epithelial cell line, h16n2, which
ectopically overexpress  xxxg721xxx . in addition, they examined a panel of breast cancer cell lines recently derived from
patients (e.g., sum149). using dna microarrays, they defined a select set of genes induced by  xxxg721xxx  overexpression and concomitantly repressed by  xxxg721xxx  inhibitors.
one of the  xxxg721xxx -transcriptionally regulated genes they
identified was  xxxg765xxx  [71]. moreover, pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity preferentially induced apoptotic cell
death of breast epithelial cells engineered to overexpress
 xxxg721xxx  relative to matched control vector cells. accordingly, we also observed that normal murine fibroblasts nih3t3 and non-cancerous breast epithelial mcf10a cells engineered to overexpress  xxxg721xxx  similarly exhibited a significant up-regulation of  xxxg765xxx  gene and protein expression,
while pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity preferentially induced apoptotic cell death of  xxxg721xxx -transformed
cells relative to untransformed controls [18, 44].
although these findings strongly suggested that an active
 xxxg765xxx -driven cellular signaling is necessary for her-2/neuenhanced cell survival, it was reasonable to suggest that
growth factor receptors other than  xxxg721xxx  may also regulate  xxxg765xxx  levels in transformed cells and, hence, the degree
of cancer cell sensitivity to  xxxg765xxx  blockers. to evaluate this
possibility and because the function of  xxxg721xxx  is closely
linked to that of its family co-members egfr ( xxxg682xxx -1),  xxxg722xxx  ( xxxg682xxx -3), and her-4 ( xxxg682xxx -4), we characterized the relationship between the cytotoxic effects of the chemical  xxxg765xxx 
blockers  xxxd463xxx  and c75 and the expression levels of the
her-1/-3/-4 in a panel of cancer cell lines naturally or ectopically expressing varying amounts of  xxxg721xxx  [18, 44].
cancer cell lines were arbitrarily defined as “low-sensitive”

492 current pharmaceutical biotechnology, 2006, vol. 7, no. 6

and “highly-sensitivity” on the basis of their ic50 values (i.e.,
the concentration of drugs producing 50% reductions in cell
viability) for  xxxd463xxx  and c75. interestingly, a striking picture emerged when the two groups of breast cancer cells
were plotted against her-1/-2/-3/-4 expression levels. there
was no apparent correlation between the expression of her-1,
her-3, or her-4 with the sensitivity to  xxxd463xxx  and c75.
however, all the breast cancer cell lines exhibiting “lowsensitivity” to chemical  xxxg765xxx  blockers were low-her-2/neuexpressors, while all the breast cancer cell lines exhibiting
“high-sensitivity” were  xxxg721xxx  overexpressors. although
this analysis clearly established that there exists a linear correlation between  xxxg721xxx  expression and the cytotoxic
effects of  xxxg765xxx  blockers, it could be argue that the cytotoxic effects of chemical  xxxg765xxx  blockers correlate, in fact,
with constitutive  xxxg765xxx  expression levels. however, her2/neu-overexpressing bt-474 and mda-mb-453 breast
cancer cell exhibited  xxxd463xxx  and c75 ic50 values comparable to those found in sk-br3 breast cancer cells, a unique
paradigm of  xxxg765xxx -overexpressing breast cancer cells in
which fas enzyme constitutes up to 28%, by weight, of the
cytosolic proteins. these results revealed that the possession
of high levels of  xxxg721xxx  oncogene, rather than  xxxg765xxx 
overexpression, may be a molecular determinant for hypersensitivity to  xxxg765xxx  blockers-induced cytotoxicity in human
breast cancer cells [18, 44]. to conclusively confirm the
selectivity of chemical inhibitors towards  xxxg721xxx  overexpressors compared with low- xxxg721xxx -expressing breast
cancer cells, we analyzed the growth inhibitory effects of
 xxxd463xxx  and c75 following the forced expression of her2/neu oncogene in mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells, which
naturally express very low amounts of both  xxxg721xxx  and
 xxxg765xxx  [72]. in this scenario, we demonstrated that the transfection with the full-length cdna of the human  xxxg721xxx 
oncogene results in an enhancement of  xxxg765xxx  expression
that does not reach the levels of fas in other naturally her2/neu-overexpressing model such as sk-br3 breast cancer
cells [44]. mda-mb-231/her-2 cells were completely inhibited by  xxxg765xxx  blockers in their capacity to form colonies in
soft-agar, whereas pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  activity had no significant effects on the anchorage-independent growth of  xxxg721xxx -negative mda-mb-231 cells.
moreover, tunel staining of c75-treated mda-mb231/her-2 cells revealed a noteworthy increase in the number of cell dying from apoptosis, whereas no major signs of
apoptosis were observed in  xxxg721xxx -negative mda-mb231 breast cancer cells [44]. therefore, the biological consequences of  xxxg765xxx  inhibition on malignant transformation,
cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell survival growth appear to truly depend, at least in part, on the expression levels
of  xxxg721xxx  oncogene [18]. importantly,  xxxg765xxx  expression
has recently been associated with  xxxg721xxx  expression in
clinical specimens from aggressive breast cancers [73].
iv.3. hyperactivation of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k downstream effector protein kinase b (akt)
in view of the experimental data indicating that in human
cancer cells, overexpression of  xxxg765xxx  can be largely attributed to constitutive activation of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k/akt kinase
pathway [16, 19, 23], van de sande et al. examined the activation status of the akt pathway, and whether this activa-

lupu and menendez

tion coincided with increased  xxxg765xxx  expression in clinical
prostate cancer tissues [74]. their data strongly suggested
that high-level expression of  xxxg765xxx  in prostate cancer is
linked to phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of activated akt. moreover, the specific inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  gene
by sirna leads to apoptosis of prostate tumor cells, and
inhibition of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k-kinase pathway synergizes with
 xxxg765xxx  sirna to enhance tumor cell death [75]. these results, altogether, provide a strong rationale for exploring the
therapeutic use of an inhibitor of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k/akt signaling
pathway in conjunction with  xxxg765xxx  blockers to inhibit cancer cell growth. in this regard, we observed that combined
treatment of the  xxxg765xxx  blocker c75 and the anti-mitotic drug
paclitaxel (taxol) inactivated the anti-apoptotic akt
kinase more than either agent alone, as evidenced by a synergistic down-regulation of akt phosphorylation at its activating site ser(473) without affecting akt protein total levels in breast cancer-derived cell lines [37].
in a recent study of human ovarian cancer cells,  xxxg765xxx 
and activated protein kinase b (-akt) expression were
coordinately regulated, suggesting a potential mechanism for
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors-related apoptosis [76]. treatment of human
ovarian cancer cells harboring constitutively active akt
(-akt) with the  xxxg1743xxx ’k inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  abolished akt activity and potentiated apoptosis induced by  xxxg765xxx 
inhibitors,  xxxd463xxx  or c75. furthermore, inhibition of
 xxxg765xxx  activity resulted in the down-regulation of -akt,
which preceded the induction of apoptosis both in vitro and
in vivo. we similarly observed that treatment of sk-br3 human breast cancer cells, which exhibit  xxxg721xxx -driven constitutive hyperactivation of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k/akt transduction
cascade, with the  xxxg1743xxx ’k inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  abolished akt activity and dramatically enhanced apoptosis induced
by  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors such as c75 or orlistat (jam and rl,
unpublished observations). similarly, liu et al. recently reported that  xxxd2523xxx -induced inhibition of the  xxxg1743xxx ’k/akt
pathway synergistically sensitized egfr-overexpressing
mda-mb-468 human breast cancer cells to cerulenininduced apoptosis via activation of caspases, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, including  xxxg2432xxx , ciap-1 and
akt, and possibly, activation of bak in mitochondria [77].
collectively, the above results are consistent with a
working model in which akt activation regulates  xxxg765xxx 
expression, at least in part, whereas  xxxg765xxx  activity modulates akt activation. indeed, the experimental findings indicate that the molecular mechanisms of specific  xxxg765xxx  inhibition appear to provoke down-regulation of the her receptors
  xxxg1743xxx ’k  akt signal transduction pathway, while constitutive activation of akt protects against  xxxg765xxx  inhibitorsinduced cell death.
v. remarks, conclusions and perspectives
studies with chemical inhibitors and, more recently, with
rnai-mediated down-regulation of  xxxg765xxx  expression have
revealed that  xxxg765xxx  inhibition has a dramatic impact on cancer cells. cancer cells stop proliferating and ultimately die, at
least in part, through the process of apoptosis. therefore,
 xxxg765xxx  and the endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway provide a number of avenues of future exploration not only applicable to the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancer but
further to its prevention and treatment.

 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors in cancer treatment

the homodimeric mammalian  xxxg765xxx  is one of the most
complex mutienzymes, in that each 250/270-kd polypeptide
chain carries all seven functional domains required for fatty
acid synthesis, and in which substrates are handed from one
functional domain to the next. the combination of  xxxg765xxx 
structural complexity and until recently the lack of x-ray
crystallography data of mammalian  xxxg765xxx  created a significant challenge in the exploitation of  xxxg765xxx  as a valuable
target for drug development. comparison of the  xxxg765xxx 
monomer and dimer structures suggests that the  xxxg765xxx 
monomers in the dimeric form of the enzyme are not aligned
side by side in a fully extended, antiparallel fashion, as proposed in the conventional model for  xxxg765xxx  organization
(fig. (1a)). indeed, as recently demonstrated, the  xxxg765xxx 
monomers adopt a coiled conformation allowing for a variety of intra- and intermonomer functional domain interactions, with the ks domains located in the central position of
the structure ([4-6]; fig. (1b)). it is hoped that this latest 4.5
å resolution x-ray crystallographic map of mammalian
 xxxg765xxx  will lay a basis for efforts at structure-based drug design with this target. while we expect that the improvement
in the selectivity and potency of forthcoming novel fasntargeted small molecule inhibitors will direct the foundation
of a new family of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer history, several reports from our group describing how fasncatalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis also participates
on the response of cancer cells to chemo-, endocrine-, and
immuno-therapies [37, 42, 72, 78-80], definitely support the
notion of  xxxg765xxx  as an attractive target for chemoprevention
or curative treatment for nearly all human epithelial malignancies.
