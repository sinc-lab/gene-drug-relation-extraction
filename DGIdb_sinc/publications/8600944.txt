glucocorticosteroids (gcs) are beneficial in allergic asthma. gcs therapy results in reduced mrna expression of  xxxd3054xxx  (il-4) and  xxxg1180xxx  in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) but not of ifn-')'.
in vitro studies with blood-derived t cells, however, show inhibition of ali three cytokines by gcs. we
studied the effects of gcs on t cells from bal in vitro, namely tho-, thi-, and th2-like clones; and
we compared bal- with blood-derived clones. dexamethasone (dex) inhibited the  xxxd2676xxx -induced
production of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and ifn-')' in all 20 clones tested. ifn-')' production was inhibited significantly
less than il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx . dex enhanced the ratio ifn-')'/il-4 (mean ± sem: control, 28.7 ± 17.6; with
10- 7 m dex, 55.0 ± 27.5, p < 0.005). interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based
on the effects of gcs on il-2 production and il-2ra expression and proliferation; 1) in low il-2.
producers dex blocked il-2 production and decreased il-2ra expression and proliferation; 2) in high
il-2 producers dex inhibited il-2 production partially and enhanced il-2ra expression and proliferation. anti-il-2 and anti-il-2ra blocked the dex-induced increase in proliferation. high levels of added
il-2 induced the second type of response. in conclusion, the production of il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  by t-cell clones
(derived either from bal or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by dex than that of ifn-')', which
may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma. the differential
effects of dex on the proliferation of high and low il-2 producers in vitro may implicate a selective outgrowth of thi-like t cells in vivo in patients treated with steroids.

patients with allergic asthma show chronic inflammation of
the airways characterized by high numbers of eosinophils
and activated t lymphocytes (1, 2). local t cells play an important role in the regulation of this inflammation through
the production of cytokines. in the bronchoalveolar lavage
(bal) fluid and bronchial biopsies from patients with allergic asthma, increased numbers of t cells can be found expressing mrna for interleukin-2 (il-2), il-4, and  xxxg1180xxx  (3,
4), with a corresponding cytokine production in vitro (5).
the expression of ifn-')' was lower than in healthy persons.
except for il-2, such a pattern of cytokine expression

resembles the t helper-2 (th2) type of cytokine profile of
allergen-specific t-cell clones.
in the treatment of patients with asthma, glucocorticosteroids (gcs) are of proven therapeutic benefit. gcs reduce the airway inflammation as reflected in a reduction of
the number of eosinophils and levels of eosinophilic products
in the bal fluid (6), and of plasma protein leakage into airway lumen (7). part of the anti-inflammatory effect may result from inhibition of 'i-cell activation and cytokine production. treatment with gcs reduced the number of local
t cells expressing the activation markers hla-dr and cd25
(8, 9). and, further, it decreased the expression of mrna
of il-4 or  xxxg1180xxx  (10, 11), whereas it increased the percentage
of ifn-')' mrna-positive cells (10), suggesting a shift from
the th2 to the thl profile.
in vitro experiments with polyclonal t cells from peripheral blood, however, have shown that gcs can inhibit the
production ofil-2 and  xxxg1180xxx  as well as ofifn-')' (12-14). the
effect on the production of il-4 is still controversial, as both
inhibition (15) and stimulation (16) of il-4 production were
reported. in similar studies with clonal t cells, gcs have
been shown to inhibit the production of ifn -')'and il-4 (17).
t cells from the airways differ phenotypically and functionally from blood t cells, suggesting the presence of highly

krouwels, van der heijden, lutter, et al.: two ways in which steroids can induce a thl shift in t cells

differentiated and activated memory t cells in the airways
(18-20). as memory t cells are shown to be less responsive
to gcs than naive t cells (21), airway- and blood-derived
t cells may show different responses to gcs. previously we
have shown that t-cell clones prepared from cells from the
bal (as compared to those from blood) possess phenotypical and functional characteristics of differentiated memory
t cells (22, 23).
to obtain further insight into the effect of gcs on the
functions of airway-derived t cells, we studied the effect of
dexamethasone (dex) on the functions of t-cell clones of
various origins. randomly generated cd4 + t-cell clones
from bal fluid and blood were used, and also allergenspecific t-cell clones from blood. t-cell clones with various
cytokine-production profiles were selected and the effect was
studied of physiological concentrations of dex on anticd3-induced production ofil-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and ifn-)'. in addition, we studied the effect of dex on the proliferation, il-2
production, and  xxxg1175xxx  expression of these clones.

materials and methods
cell culture and reagents
cells were cultured in iscove's modified dulbecco's medium (gibco, paisley, uk) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated pooled human serum (central laboratory of the
netherlands red cross blood transfusion service [clb],
amsterdam, the netherlands), 2 x 10- 5 m ij- xxxd26xxx  (merck, munich, germany), 2 mm na-pyruvate
(merck), penicillin (100 u/ml; gist-brocades, delft, the
netherlands) and streptomycin (100 itg/ml, gibco). all
cultures were incubated at 37°c in humidified air containing
5 % co 2 , the cells were stimulated with appropriate stimuli as indicated. phyto-hemagglutinin (pha, ha-16) was
obtained from wellcome (dartford, uk); mab  xxxd2676xxx 
clbt3/3 was a gift from dr. r. a. w. van lier (clb); mab
 xxxd2676xxx   xxxd2676xxx  was from ortho (raritan, nj); and recombinant human il-2 (rhil-2) was obtained from cetus (emeryville, ca).
other reagents applied in cell cultures were: mab anti-tac
(24), a gift from dr. van lier; mik{j1 (25), a gift from
dr. 1. hakimi (hoffmann-la roche, nutley, nj); polyclonal anti-il-2 (ep-ioo, [26]) from genzyme (emeryville);
sodium-dex from bufa chemicals (castricum, the netherlands); prednisone was from opg (amsterdam, the netherlands); hydrocortisone from sigma (st louis, mo); and
 xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx  diproprionate from the glaxo research
laboratory (greenford, uk).
preparation of t-lymphocyte clones
randomlygenerated t-cellclones were prepared from the bal
and peripheral blood from three healthy subjects and two patients with allergicasthma of moderate severityin a stable phase
of the disease (22). briefly, the macrophages were removed
from the bal cells either by centrifugation on a density gradient or by adherence to culture flasks. peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc) were isolated on a  xxxd3253xxx  density
gradient. then the lymphocytes were cloned by limiting dilution, seeding the cells at a density of 0.3 cell/well. the growthinducing stimuli were pha, feeder cells (irradiated peripheral
blood mononuclear cells), and il-2 (20 vlml, either as lym-

389

focult [biotest, dreiech, germany], or as a supernatant of
con a-stimulated pbmc). thus cd4 +icd45ro+icd45rat-cell clones were obtained. when sufficient cell numbers
were obtained, t-cell clones were frozen until further use.
clones producing a relatively high amount of il-4 and low
amount of ifn-)' after stimulation with  xxxd2676xxx , resulting
in a ratio ifn-)'/il-4 of less than 1, were considered th2like clones. clones which predominantly produced ifn-)'
(ifn-)'/il-4 > 30) were considered thl-like clones. all remaining clones were designated tho clones.
allergen-specific clones were generated from the blood
as described earlier (27,28). three house-dust-mite proteinspecific cd4 + clones (all tho) and one house-dust-mite
major allergen (der p ii)-specific clone (jba2, a th2 clone)
were from atopic individuals; one (der p ii)-specific clone
(pbal, tho) was from a healthy person.
study design
cd4 + clones with a tho, thl, or a th2-like cytokine
production profile, as previously assessed, were selected
(23, 27, 28). the clones were thawed and expanded as described above. four days after stimulation the cells were
washed, seeded again in fresh culture medium without the
growth-inducing stimuli, and kept for another 3 days. this
procedure reduces the state of activation of clones at the end
of this 7-day culture (29). the cells were then collected,
washed, and seeded at 1.0 x 106 cells/ml in anti-cd3coated wells (clbt3/3, coating concentration 0.5 itg/ml).
incubations were performed in 5-fold, in 96-well roundbottom plates (costar, cambridge, ma). occasionally,
coated  xxxd2676xxx  was used as stimulus or rhil-2 (90 u/ml) was
added. dex and other corticosteroids were added together
with the stimulus unless stated otherwise. supernatants were
harvested after the indicated time and stored at - 20°e.
in the il-2 and  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx )-blocking experiments, all antibodies were diluted in culture medium and
clones were incubated with the mabs for 30 min at 37°c before they were seeded.
cytokine assays
cytokine concentrations were measured by elisa. ifn-)'
was measured using mab md2 anti-if'nev as a capture antibody and biotinylated mab mdi anti-if'nvv as a detecting
antibody (30). a supernatant of pha-stimulated pbmc was
used as a standard for the ifn-)' assay; the concentration of
ifn -)' in this supernatant was determined by an independent
elisa (medgenics, brussels, belgium).  xxxg1180xxx  was measured
using mab trfk-5 anti- xxxg1180xxx  (coating concentration 1 itgl
ml) and biotinylated mab7 anti- xxxg1180xxx  (l ug/ml) (31). recombinant hil-5 from genzyme was used as a standard. after
incubation with the second antibody, the procedures for the
ifn-)' and  xxxg1180xxx  elisa were identical: plates were incubated
with streptavidine poly-hrp (clb, 1:10,000 v/v) in pbs
containing 2 % (v/v) cow's milk, and subsequently developed
with tetramethylbenzidine (sigma) and h20 2 • lower limits
of detection: ifn-)', 50 pg/ml;  xxxg1180xxx , 250 pglml. il-4 and  xxxg1173xxx  were measured by elisa (clb and genzyme, respectively); lower limits of detection were: 2 pg/ml (il-4) and 0.2
u/ml (il-2).

assays for cell proliferation and quantitation
proliferation assays were performed parallel to the induction
of cytokine production. cells were incubated at 1 x 106
cells/ml in  xxxd2676xxx -coated wells for 72 h. during the last
4 h the cells were exposed to ph] thymidine (0.2 /lci [=
7.4 kbq/well]). cells were then harvested on glass filters
(packard, downers grove, il) and incorporated radioactivity was determined (topcount, packard). all conditions
were performed in 5-fold, and expressed as mean and sd.
occasionally, cells were counted with the use of a coulter
counter (coulter electronics, hialeah, fl), and with a flow
cytometer (facscan; becton dickinson, mountain view,
ca). in the latter procedure, a known number of fluoresceinisothiocyanate (fitc, 0.015 mg/ml, sigmaj-labeled candida
albicans was added to the clone suspension as a reference.
in the flowcytometer the number of events in the lymphocyte
gate (as judged from forward- and side-scatter) was related
to the number of events in the candida gate (judged from forward scatter and fitc staining intensity) (32).
measurement of the expression of  xxxg1175xxx  alpha,
beta, and gamma chain
cells were washed 3 times in pbs containing 2 % (v/v) bovine  xxxg124xxx  (boseral, organon teknika). cells
were then incubated on ice with either an fitc-iabeled antibody anti-il-2ra-chain (anti-cd25, becton-dickinson),
a phyco-erythrin (pe)-labeled anti- xxxg1175xxx (j-chain (bectondickinson) or an fitc- or pe-iabeled irrelevant isotype control for 30 min. the mab anti- xxxg1175xxx -')' (3b5, a gift from
dr. 1. ritz, boston [33]) was unlabeled; therefore, the cells
were first incubated with unlabeled goat-anti-mouse in order
to saturate mab mouse- xxxd2676xxx  that might still be present
on the  xxxd2676xxx -stimulated cells. the cells were then incubated with the antibody (1:500 diluted) in the presence of
1% (v/v) normal mouse serum and finally the cells were incubated with fitc-iabeled goat-anti-mouse. after three
washes the binding of the antibodies was measured using a
flow cytometer.
statistical analysis
non-parametric tests were used in all calculations. differences between paired groups were evaluated using the wilcoxon signed rank test. in unpaired data the mann-whitneyu test was performed. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

results
corticosteroids inhibit production of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,
and ifn-')' in tho, thl, and th2 clones
in figure 1 the time course of the effect of dex on the
production of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and ifn-')' by bal-derived tho
clones is shown. dex inhibited the production of  xxxg1180xxx  and
ifn-')' at all time points in a dose-dependent fashion. il-4
production was slightly increased by 10- 11 m dex at 24 h.
such a low concentration of dex was only tested in four
clones, two of which repeatedly showed an increase in il-4
production of 5% to 45% at 24 h after stimulation. at later
time points and at higher concentrations of dex a dosedependent inhibition of il-4 production was found. at the
highest concentration tested (10-5 m), dex inhibited the

production of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and ifn-')' to about 20% of the
control. the effects of dex were essentially the same when
dex was added 1 h after the cells were seeded in the anticd3-coated wells, or when the cells were preincubated with
dex for 1 h at 37°c. this indicates that dex did not affect
the signaling through the cd3 molecule.
in 20 clones from bal fluid and blood, the effectof dex
(10-7 m) on the cytokine production was studied. results of
a representative panel of 10 clones are shown in table 1. the
tho, thl, or th2-like cytokine profile of each clone is expressed as the ratio ifn-')'/il-4. inhibition of cytokine production was found in thl clones (27d9, 1207, le3), th2
clones (5b5, jba2), and tho clones (remaining). table 1
shows that inhibition of cytokine production is found in all
groups, distinguished by the origin and nature of the t cells.
in particular, also in clones generated from bal fluid from
allergic asthmatic patients the production of the three
cytokines was inhibited in a similar fashion as in those from
healthy persons. the inhibition of the production of il-4,
 xxxg1180xxx , or ifn-')' by bal clones (n = 10) did not differ significantly from the inhibition found in the randomly generated blood-derived t-cell clones (n = 5)(mann-whitney-u
test, p = 0.81, 0.77, and 0.54, respectively).
the glucocorticosteroids hydrocortisone and  xxxd294xxx  inhibited the production ofil-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and
ifn-')', although they were less potent than dex. for all
three cytokines, the concentration of hydrocortisone inhibiting the cytokine production by 50% (ic50 ) was 14 to 21
times higher than that of dex. the ic50 of  xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx 
diproprionate was 2 to 4 times higher.
the production of il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  is more susceptible to
inhibition by dex than that of ifn-')'
it can be seen from figure 1 that il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  production
were equally inhibited by dex, whereas the production of
ifn-')' was inhibited less. the ic50 of dex was determined
by establishing similar titration curves in five tho clones.
the ranges of the ic50 were: il-4 production, 10- 10 m to
10-9 m;  xxxg1180xxx , 10- 10 m to 10- 8 m; ifn-')', 10- 8 m to 10-7 m.
in all clones the ic50 for ifn-')' was higher than for il-4
or  xxxg1180xxx .
also when all 20 clones were analyzed, the percentage of
inhibition of the production of il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  by 10- 7 m
dex was significantly higher than that of ifn-')' (wilcoxon
test, p < 0.05). as a consequence, the ratio ifn-')'/il-4 increased in the presence of dex (p < 0.005, table 1). the
increase in the ratio ifn-')'/il-4 was found both in clones
from bal and blood. notably, the ratio ifn-')'/il-4 also increased in most th2-like t-cell clones.
dexamethasone either inhibits or stimulates the
 xxxd2676xxx -induced proliferation
in parallel with the cytokine-production assays, we measured the effect of dex on the proliferation of t-cell clones.
a heterogeneous effect of dex on the  xxxd2676xxx -induced
proliferation was found (table 1). in allergen-specific clones
and in th2-like clones, inhibition of proliferation was always
found. most other clones showed inhibition of the ph] thymidine incorporation or no effect. in three clones, two derived from bal (1207 and 3bl) and one from the blood

(ifl), all from healthy subjects, dex significantly enhanced
the  xxxd2676xxx -induced proliferation. using clone 3bl to
study this observation in more detail, we found a dosedependent enhancement of proliferation by dex  xxxd1891xxx - 9 to
10- 5 m (figure 2). essentially the same results were found
at suboptimal concentrations of  xxxd2676xxx , after stimulation
with another coated mab  xxxd2676xxx  ( xxxd2676xxx , at 0.2, 1, and
5 jlg/ml) and when other corticosteroids were added (hydrocortisone, 2.5 x 10- 7 m; prednisone, 10- 7 m;  xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx  diproprionate, 10- 7 m).
the enhancement of the proliferation of clone 3bl was
confirmed by measuring the actual number of cells after
stimulation. seventy hours after stimulation we assessed the
number of cells using either a coulter counter or a flow cytometer in parallel with the assay of ph] thymidine incorporation. after stimulation with  xxxd2676xxx  and  xxxd2676xxx  +
dex, we found the following cell numbers: coulter
counter, 0.5 x 106 cells/ml and 0.75 x 106 cells/ml,
respectively; flow cytometer, 0.27 and 0.6 x 106 cells/ml,
respectively; and ph] thymidine incorporation, 9,032 and
17,105 cpm, respectively.
to study whether a secreted product was involved in the
stimulation of the proliferation of clone 3bl we removed the
supernatants from the cells 24 h after stimulation. the cells
were then washed and seeded again in  xxxd2676xxx -coated wells
in fresh culture medium with dex being added again. in
these wells dex did not enhance the  xxxd2676xxx -induced
proliferation at 70 h (mean and sd of quintuplicates of the
ph] thymidine incorporation: control experiment, 4,757 ±
332; with dex added, 8,676 ± 284; after removal of supernatants, without dex, 4,480 ± 1,183; with dex added,
2,787 ± 1,972). however, when the supernatants were
returned to the cells from which they originated, the proliferation was again enhanced (without dex, 5,620 ± 239; with

dex 7,021 ± 323). this suggested that a soluble factor was
involved in the response.
the enhancement of proliferation by dex is
found only in clones producing large amounts of
il-2, or when exogenous il-2 is added
il-2 is a powerful autocrine growth factor of t cells which,
via the  xxxg1175xxx , regulates t-cell proliferation. to study
the role of il-2 in the modulation of proliferation we measured the il-2 concentration in the supernatants of nine
clones showing inhibition and three clones showing enhancement of proliferation in the presence of dex (figure 3). we
found that the proliferation-enhanced clones all produced
high levels of il-2, which could only partially be inhibited
by dex (ic5o , 0.8-1.4 x 10- 7 m). in contrast, all proliferation-inhibited clones produced less il-2 than 1 v/ml,
which was completely blocked by dex. il-2 production
differed significantly between the two groups, regardless of
the presence of dex (p = 0.01, mann-whitney-v test).
the addition of exogenous rhil-2 (90 v/ml) to three
proliferation-inhibited clones induced enhancement of proliferation by dex (clones 2bl, 4dl, and pbal: ph] thymidine incorporation in the presence of dex, without il-2,

the  xxxd2676xxx -stimulated clones 3bl and 12m did not
influence either the  xxxd2676xxx -induced proliferation or the
enhancement of proliferation by dex. this suggests that in
these clones even in the presence of dex the levels of endogenously produced il-2 sufficed to induce maximal proliferation. after long-term culturing of clone 3bl, the il-2
production upon  xxxd2676xxx  stimulation decreased to 0.2 v/
ml. under these conditions dex inhibited the proliferation of clone 3bl (mean and sd: 16,525 ± 1,968 cpm without dex; 2,035 cpm in the presence of dex). however,

when il-2 was added, dex again enhanced the proliferation
(20,683 ± 815 cpm without dex; 27,865 ± 2,792 cpm in
the presence of dex). when clone 3b1 was stimulated with
pha or phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  acetate (pma), dex strongly inhibited the proliferation. with these stimuli the il-2 production, however, was considerably lower than after stimulation
with  xxxd2676xxx  and was completely blocked by dex. these
results suggest that the enhancement of proliferation critically depended on the presence of il-2, whether endogenously produced or added to the cells.
dexamethasone enhances il-2ra-chain expression in
the presence of il-2
the high-affinity receptor for il-2 ( xxxg1175xxx ) on t cells is composed of at least three chains: a ( xxxd924xxx ), {3 (p75), and -y ( xxxg1176xxx )
(34, 35). the {3- and -y-chains can bind il-2 with intermediate affinity. the expression of the a-chain, however, is believed to control the functional high affinity  xxxg1175xxx . as in the
clones with enhanced proliferation, il-2 production still was
found in the presence of dex; we tested whether the enhanced proliferation might be explained by an increase in
the  xxxg1175xxx  expression. we measured the expression of the
a-chain (cd25) in clones 3b1 and 1f1 (dex-enhanced proliferation) and in clones 4d1 and pba1 (dex-inhibited proliferation). as expected,  xxxd2676xxx  stimulation enhanced the
cd25 expression in each clone (shown in figure 4). the addition of dex to clones 3b1 and 1f1 resulted in enhancement of cd25 expression; mean and range of the mean

to 181%); 1f1, 137% (104 to 168%). a decrease in the mfi
of cd25 expression was found in clones 4d1 and pba1
(resultsoftwoexperiments: 4d1, 26% and44%; pba1, 33%
and 65% of the control). however, when both dex and il-2
were added to clones 4d1 and pba1, enhancement of cd25
expression was found (4d1, 131% and 139%; pba1, 129%
and 112 %). the expression of  xxxg1175xxx {3-chain was low and
mainly found in clones with a high expression of cd25. its
expression was slightly enhanced by  xxxd2676xxx  stimulation;

393

dex did not inhibit the expression of  xxxg1175xxx {3-chain (table
2). the  xxxg1175xxx -y-chain was measured only in clone 3bl. its
expression increased after stimulation with  xxxd2676xxx , which
was not inhibited by dex (table 2).
the stimulation of the proliferation by dex depends on
il-2- xxxg1175xxx  interaction
to study whether enhancement of the proliferation by dex
was induced by the binding of endogenously produced il-2
to the  xxxg1175xxx , we stimulated clone 3b1 in the presence of
blocking antibodies anti-il-2, anti-il-2ra-chain, or antiil-2r{3-chain. the results are shown in figure 5. when
clone 3b1 was stimulated with 5 u il-2/ml the combination
of the three antibodies completely blocked the proliferation
(not shown). when the cells were stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx ,
cell proliferation in the presence of all three antibodies was
inhibited to 70%. this relatively limited inhibition showed
that the antibodies did not exhibit a serious toxic effect on
the cells. this was confirmed by the finding that the proliferation was not inhibited when the same amount of antibodies
was added to clones stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx  in the presence of a high concentration of il-2. dex enhanced the
proliferation of clone 3bl. the antibody anti-il-2 almost
completely inhibited the enhanced proliferation induced by
dex. this was also found for anti-il-2ra, but not for antiil-2r{3; anti- xxxg1175xxx {3, however, was synergistic with anti- xxxg1174xxx  in inhibiting the proliferation in the presence of dex.
the combination of the three antibodies almost completely
inhibited the proliferative response induced by  xxxd2676xxx 
with dex. table 3 shows that essentially the same results
were found in clone 1f1,and in clone 4d1 supplemented with
il-2.

findings in the lungs after gcs therapy and in vitro results
with peripheral blood t cells, we have analyzed the effects
of gcs on t-cell clones from bronchoalveolar lavage and
blood. our findings indicate that: i) gcs inhibit the production of the th2 cytokines il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  more strongly than
that of ifn-'y; and 2) gcs inhibit the proliferation of low
il-2-producing clones and enhance the proliferation of high
il-2 producers. these effects of gcs occurred at concentrations of corticosteroids of 10- 10 to 10- 6 m, which are likely
to occur in vivo after therapy (36-38).
earlier studies were mostly conducted in either pbmc or
a polyclonal t-cell population (12-14). by studying the effect
of dex on tho, thl, and th2-like t-cell clones, we were
able to show that dex affects cytokine production similarly
in all three types of clones. we found inhibition of the
production of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and ifn-'y in all clones tested,
regardless of their origin; i.e., in clones from bal fluid and
blood, and in randomly cloned and allergen-specific clones.
from this we conclude that the inhibition of the production
of these cytokines is a general feature of the effect of steroids
on human memory t cells.
the quantitative response to dex of the production of
th2-related cytokines il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  and that of thl-related
cytokine ifn-'y, however, did show significant differences.
the production ofifn-'y was inhibited to a lesser extent than
that of il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx . consequently, the ratio ifn-'y/1l-4
was significantly higher in supernatants from dex-treated
cells. recently, similar observation was made in peripheral
blood lymphocytes, (t. van der pouw-kraan, personal communication) and in polyclonal memory t cells (39). the in
vivo correlate of these findings may be that glucocorticosteroids preferentially inhibit the production of il-4 and

krouwels, van der heijden, lutter, et al.: two ways in which steroids can induce a thl shift in t cells

araneo suggested that in murine t cells, steroids induce a
shift to the th2 cytokine profile (16). however, schmidt and
colleagues reported inhibition of il-4 production in murine
th2 cells (40). for human t cells, wu and coworkers (15)
showed a reduction of il-4 production and mrna accumulation. more recently, brinkmann and kristofic showed increased il-4 production by high concentrations of dex in
polyclonal cd4 +cd45ro- t cells and inhibition of il-4
production in cd4 +cd45ro+ t cells (39). a slight increase in il-4 production was found by snijdewint and colleagues in human allergen-specific t-cell clones but only at
very low concentrations of steroids (17); at higher concentrations a marked inhibition was observed. our results confirm
the latter findings:  xxxd1891xxx - 11 m, dex enhanced the production of il-4 when tested at 24 h. at later time points and at
higher concentrations of dex, however, the il-4 production
was strongly inhibited in all clones. therefore, differences
between human and murine cells, naive and memory t cells,
or the concentration of the steroids and the time point of
analysis of the cytokine production may determine the results for il-4 production.
we have no information regarding the mechanisms that
may be responsible for the observed differences between the
production of ifn--y and the production of il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx .
gcs exert their effect after binding to a cytosolic  xxxg1601xxx . this complex translocates to the nucleus
where it binds to specific glucocorticoid response elements
in the upstream regulatory region of genes, which either inhibit or stimulate transcription. thus, inhibition by gcs of
the transcription of genes encoding for ifn--y,il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx 
was shown (13, 41). the number of glucocorticoid response
elements and their position relative to the transcriptional site
may be an important determinant of the magnitude of the response to gcs. an important other mechanism may reside
at the level of transcription factors like  xxxg1559xxx  that regulate
transcription of genes encoding for cytokines. gcs affect the
function of transcription factors either directly or by the induction of inhibitory factors such as i-kb (42, 43). this protein strongly inhibits the induction of gene transcription by
 xxxg1559xxx  that is active for several cytokines, including il-4,
 xxxg1180xxx , and ifn--y. also other mediators may be involved in
the cytokine production and gcs may affecttheir levels. one
of the mediators which is reported to inhibit il-4 and enhance ifn--y production is transforming growth factor-dl
(tgf-{31) (44). the production of tgf-{31 by t cells was
shown to be stimulated by dex (45). thus, enhancement of
endogenously produced tgf-{31 may further reduce il-4
production and counteract the inhibition of the production of
ifn --y. recently, it was shown that murine thl cells can produce  xxxd2738xxx  (no), which inhibits cytokine production
by thl but not th2 cells (46). gcs inhibit no production
(47) and may also in this way favor the production of thl
cytokines.
in contrast to the uniform inhibition of the cytokine
production, dex affected the proliferation of the clones of
both bal and blood heterogeneously. in the clones with a
th2-like cytokine profile and in allergen-specific (th2 and
tho) clones, only inhibition of proliferation was found. in
randomly cloned t cells with a thl or thocytokine profile,
we found either no effect, inhibition, or stimulation of the

395

proliferation. such a differential effect of dex may eventually lead to a shift from the th2 to the tho/thl cytokine
profile.
the enhancement of the growth of human t cells by dex
was an unexpected finding and led us to study this phenomenon in more detail. also, these results were observed in
clones independent of their origin. the enhanced proliferation depended critically on the presence of a high concentration of il-2. without addition of exogenous il-2, enhanced
proliferation was found only in clones producing a high
amount of il-2. in these clones il-2 production was inhibited by dex, but, notably, not completely abrogated. in
low il-2 producing clones, enhancement of proliferation by
dex could be induced by the addition of exogenous il-2.
from our results we postulate the following mechanism:
 xxxd2676xxx  activates t cells leading to il-2 production and to
 xxxg1175xxx  expression and proliferation. dex, in conjunction
with  xxxd2676xxx  and il-2, enhances the expression ofil-2rachain, resulting in an increased expression of functional il-2
receptors. subsequently, binding of il-2 to the  xxxg1175xxx  again
results in a stimulatory signal in the t cells leading to enhancement of proliferation. the second stimulatory signal
can only occur if there is either still a substantial il-2 production in spite of the presence of dex or when il-2 is
added. reed earlier showed (48) that exogenous il-2 could
reverse the inhibition by dex of the proliferation of pbmc.
our hypothesis is further supported by a recent study of
wiegers and coworkers (49) with rat splenic lymphocytes.
for polyclonal human cd4 + cells, nijhuis and colleagues
(50) also reported enhancement of proliferation by dex.
this was found only in conditions where cells were maximally activated and high levels of il-2 were produced.
our study shows that dex can upregulate il-2ra-chain.
an important factor in the regulation of il-2ra is the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx . gcs can interfere with  xxxg1559xxx  either through inactivation (51) or by the induction of inhibitory proteins (42, 43); thus, inhibited expression ofil-2ra
might have been expected. however, a stimulating effect of
dex on the expression of (cell surface levels and mrna expression of) il-2ra was already reported for rat and murine
t-cell lines by femandez-ruiz and coworkers (52) and
lamas and colleagues (53). lamas showed that the effect of
dex resided at the level of the il-2ra-chain gene transcription in a gene segment which contains il-2 response elements and which is distinct from the  xxxg1559xxx  binding elements. pimentel and coworkers (54) demonstrated induction
of il-2ra chain by il-2 to occur independent from the induction of  xxxg1559xxx . therefore, dex in combination with
il-2 may increase il-2ra-chain expression independent of
 xxxg1559xxx . on the other hand, boumpass and colleagues (55)
reported inhibition by dex of the il-2ra-chain gene expression in pbmc, though in the presence of suprapharmacological concentrations of dex (10-4 m). inhibition of
il-2ra expression by dex was also shown in pma-blasts
which were stimulated with il-2 (56); however, this effect
was only found when the cells were preincubated overnight
in medium containing dex without stimulus. these conflicting findings probably resulted from differences in the activational and differentiational state of the cells, and in particular
the amount of il-2 present and the basal expression of il-

396

2ra. boumpass and coworkers also suggested that the observed inhibition of il-2ra may be the result of inhibition
ofil-2 production by dex. lamas and colleagues (53) have
shown that basal expression of the il-2ra-chain and the
presence of il-2 are required for dex-induced upregulation. our results are in line with those findings: at the start
of our experiments the t-cell clones expressed a low level of
cd25 and upregulation of cd25 was only found in the presence ofil-2. our results also show for the first time that upregulation of the il-2ra-chain on human t cells by dex
results in enhanced expression of functional il-2 receptors:
dex did not inhibit the expression of the il-2rj3- and
-v-chain, and it enhanced the proliferation of t-cell clones.
from the present study we conclude that glucocorticosteroids can have different effects on the functions of t-cell
clones: first, by inhibiting the production of il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx 
to a greater extent than that of ifn-')'; second, by inhibiting
the proliferation of clones producing a small amount ofil-2
and by enhancing the proliferation of high il-2-producing
clones. these effects are found both in blood- and balderived t-cell clones. as th2-like cells produce only little
il-2, we hypothesize that when memory t cells in vivo are
repeatedly exposed to corticosteroids the two effects may
synergize, resulting in a shift of the cytokine production
profile toward the thl type. indeed, decreased mrna levels
for il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  and increased mrna levels for ifn-')'
were found in bronchoalveolar lavage cells of steroid-treated
asthmatic patients (10). the mechanism we propose may in
part account for the beneficial effects of steroids in il-4- and
 xxxg1180xxx -related diseases such as allergic asthma. a subgroup of
asthmatic patients does not respond to gcs therapy; dex
hardly inhibited the proliferation and il-2 production by
pbmc from these patients (38, 57). bal fluid cells from
such patients showed a much higher percentage of cells that
were il-2 mrna positive than did cells from gcs responsive patients (58). it may be hypothesized that in those
patients very high production of il-2 is not completely
inhibited by gcs treatment, which, in combination with
dex-induced enhanced expression of the il-2ra, results in
a continuing activation of t cells. in such patients, therapy
directed at the prevention of il-2 production and at the
prevention of il-2 mediated effects may diminish disease
symptoms.
