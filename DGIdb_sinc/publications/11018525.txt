abstract  xxxd2096xxx  and fasting are known to regulate several
genes involved in lipid metabolism in a similar way. in this study
measuring several mitochondrial enzyme activities, we demonstrate that, in contrast to  xxxg522xxx  and complex ii,
 xxxg569xxx  oxidase (cox) is a specific target of these two
treatments. in mouse liver organelles, western blot experiments
indicated that mitochondrial levels of  xxxg2360xxx , a mitochondrial t3
receptor, and mitochondrial peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor (mt-ppar), previously described as a dimeric partner
of  xxxg2360xxx  in the organelle, are increased by both  xxxd2096xxx  and
fasting. in addition, in ppark
k-deficient mice, this influence was
abolished for mt-ppar but not for  xxxg2360xxx , whereas the increase in
cox activity was not altered. these data indicate that: (1)
ppark
k is involved in specific regulation of mt-ppar expression
by both treatments; (2)  xxxd2096xxx  and fasting regulate the
mitochondrial levels of  xxxg2360xxx  and thus affect the efficiency of the
direct t3 mitochondrial pathway. ß 2000 federation of european biochemical societies. published by elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
l-oxidation is a major process by which  xxxd2154xxx  are
oxidized. from this reaction, mitochondria produce most of
the energy in animal cells through the oxidative phosphorylation chain containing enzymatic subunits encoded by both
nuclear and mitochondrial genes.
several peroxisome proliferators (pps) such as ¢brate [1]
have been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator activated
receptors (ppars) which are members of the steroid nuclear
receptor superfamily [1,2]. pps are known to activate enzymes
involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism (peroxisomal
and mitochondrial l-oxidation, microsomal g-hydroxylation
and ketone body synthesis) [2^7]. several studies have also
underlined that fasting, like pp exposure, induces l-oxidation
gene expression, probably by increasing fatty acid levels [8,9].
moreover, experiments performed in ppark-de¢cient mice

(ppark3/3) established that this nuclear receptor is needed
for the induction by ¢brate or fasting of several genes involved in lipid oxidation such as acyl-coa oxidase, enoylcoa hydratase and 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase [8^11]. these observations point to a key role for ppark in lipid homeostasis.
like thyroid hormone [12^17], pps regulate mitochondrial
activity [18^20]. they alter mitochondrial morphology and
enzyme composition [21^23]. in addition, they also increase
mitochondrial mrna and rrna levels [18]. today, it has
been proposed that pps, such as feno¢brate, indirectly act
at organelle level through the ppar nuclear pathway.
in addition to the well-known mitochondrial transcription
factor mt-tfa [24], we have previously demonstrated that a
 xxxg2283xxx  ( xxxg2360xxx ) located in the mitochondrial
matrix is a potent mitochondrial transcription factor [16,17].
moreover, we have characterized a 45 kda protein immunologically related to pparq2 (naming it mt-ppar), occurring
in the mitochondrial matrix [25]. interestingly, mt-ppar and
 xxxg2360xxx  have been detected in a common complex which binds to
a dr2 sequence of the mitochondrial d-loop [25].
in the present work, we have studied the in£uence of feno¢brate treatment or fasting on  xxxg2360xxx  and mt-ppar mitochondrial levels in relation to mitochondrial activity. we also
tested the possible involvement of the nuclear receptor ppark
in the regulation of these factors by using liver mitochondria
extracted from control or ppark-de¢cient mice. we report
here that feno¢brate or fasting do not in£uence mt-tfa
amounts but increase mitochondrial levels of  xxxg2360xxx  and mtppar in a similar way. in addition, we found that ppark
is involved in the regulation of mt-ppar expression.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
feno¢brate treatment or fasting were carried out in control
(c57bl/6) or ppark-de¢cient mice on a c57bl/6 background
[10,11]. in the ¢rst experiment, all animals were allowed free access
to food. they were assigned to four groups: a control group (n = 6)
receiving a single intraperitoneal injection of the vehicle used for feno¢brate administration; a treated group (n = 6) receiving a single
intraperitoneal injection of feno¢brate (300 mg/kg); two groups
were constituted in the ppark3/3 mice (n = 6 in each group). as
with the control mice, the ¢rst group received only the vehicle, whereas the second received the feno¢brate treatment previously described.
in a second experiment, using a similar procedure, six control and six
ppark3/3 mice were allowed free access to food and were killed 3 h
following the beginning of the dark, and the remaining two groups

were starved for 30 h. at this stage, all animals were killed between
9 and 11 a.m. and the livers were collected and immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen.
2.2. mitochondria preparations and enzymatic activities
liver mitochondria were prepared by di¡erential centrifugation according to wrutniak et al. [16].  xxxg522xxx ,  xxxg569xxx  oxidase (cox) and succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex ii)
activities were measured according to rochard et al. [26].
2.3. western blot analysis
mitochondrial proteins (50 wg) were electrophoresed through sds^
page gel, transferred to a pdvf membrane and detected by a
chemiluminescent western blot procedure. anti-rhtii, anti-pparq2
and anti-mt-tfa antisera have been described previously [16,17,25].
anti-e2-pdh antiserum was kindly provided by dr c. marsac (inserm, paris). quanti¢cation of signal intensities was carried out with
a phosphorimager (molecular dynamics) and normalized against e2pdh used as invariant.

3. results
3.1. feno¢brate treatment or fasting speci¢cally increased
cox activity
to test the in£uence of feno¢brate or fasting upon mitochondrial activity, we measured several enzymatic activities:
two enzymes encoded by nuclear genes,  xxxg522xxx  (a key
enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle) and succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex ii), and one enzymatic complex encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, cox.
in control or ppark3/3 mice, feno¢brate did not in£uence  xxxg522xxx  and complex ii activities (table 1). on
the other hand, it induced a signi¢cant rise in cox activity in
control animals as well as in mice lacking ppark (table 1).
similar changes in cox activities were induced by fasting in
control or ppark-de¢cient mice (table 1). in addition, as
described for feno¢brate, fasting did not in£uence  xxxg522xxx  or complex ii activities (table 1).

anti-rhtii, anti-pparq2 or anti-e2-pdh antisera. quanti¢cation

tfa, a constitutive transcription factor of the organelle, and
 xxxg2360xxx , a t3-dependent mitochondrial transcription factor. the
amounts of the mitochondrial pparq2-related protein, mtppar [25], were also monitored.
in comparison to control mice, feno¢brate induced an up to
two-fold increase in the levels of  xxxg2360xxx  or mt-ppar (fig. 1). in
addition, whereas the induction of mt-ppar by feno¢brate
was completely abolished in mice lacking ppark, the rise in
amounts of  xxxg2360xxx  was not altered in these animals (fig. 1).
similar results were obtained for the in£uence of fasting
(fig. 2). however, the mitochondrial levels of mt-tfa were
not altered by feno¢brate, fasting or in ppark gene invalidation (fig. 3).
4. discussion

3.2. feno¢brate treatment or fasting increased  xxxg2360xxx  and
mt-ppar mitochondrial levels
the observation that, in contrast to  xxxg522xxx  or
complex ii, cox activity is up-regulated by feno¢brate or
fasting suggests a major in£uence of these treatments on mitochondrial genome expression. to test this possibility, we
studied their in£uence on the mitochondrial amounts of mt-

in the present study, we found that feno¢brate or fasting do
not in£uence  xxxg522xxx  or complex ii activity. on the
other hand, these treatments induced a signi¢cant rise in cox
activity. such a di¡erence could re£ect the genetic origin of
these enzymes. whereas the latter are encoded by nuclear
genes, cox is a multimeric complex involving distinct subunits encoded by nuclear genes and by the mitochondrial genome. therefore, speci¢c regulation of cox activity by feno¢brate or fasting suggests that the two treatments a¡ect

mitochondrial activity essentially by stimulating mitochondrial genome transcription, as already described [18].
in previous studies, we demonstrated the occurrence of
truncated forms of members of the nuclear receptor family
in the mitochondrial matrix [16,25]. we have also established
that  xxxg2360xxx , a t3-binding protein synthesized by the use of an
internal aug occurring in the c-erb  xxxg107xxx  mrna [27] acts as
a t3-dependent transcription factor of the mitochondrial genome [17]. in addition, we demonstrated [25] that it binds to
the mitochondrial d-loop by forming a complex including mtppar, a pparq2-related protein devoid of the carboxy-terminus of the nuclear receptor.
interestingly, we report here that stimulation of organite
activity by feno¢brate or fasting is related to an increase in
mitochondrial amounts of  xxxg2360xxx . as we have shown that  xxxg2360xxx 
overexpression stimulates mitochondrial genome transcription
[17] and cox activity [16], but not  xxxg522xxx  activity,
we suggest that such a mechanism is involved in the in£uence
of the two treatments at mitochondrial level. this possibility
is concordant with the present observation that regulation of
 xxxg2360xxx  expression is not abolished in ppark-de¢cient mice, and
that stimulation of cox activity is not grossly impaired in
these animals. in addition, the observation that mt-tfa is
not in£uenced by feno¢brate or fasting suggests that this constitutive mitochondrial transcription factor is not involved in
the regulation of mitochondrial activity.
another striking result is the observation that, as previously
reported for pparq nuclear receptors [28], mt-ppar
amounts are increased by a feno¢brate treatment. this is concordant with the stimulation of mt-ppar abundance by clo¢brate in rat liver mitochondria already documented [25]. in
contrast to  xxxg2360xxx , this regulation is abrogated in ppark-de¢cient mice, thus suggesting that this nuclear receptor plays a
key role in the regulation of mt-ppar expression. however,
despite the lack of in£uence of ¢brate or fasting on mt-ppar
in ppark-de¢cient mice, stimulation of cox activity is
maintained in knocked-out animals in these conditions.
our data indicate that the rise in cox activity and mitochondrial amounts of  xxxg2360xxx  induced by feno¢brate also occurred in ppark3/3 mice. this is probably an interesting
result clearly establishing that not all ¢brate in£uences are
mediated by the nuclear receptor ppark.
in conclusion, this study clearly suggests that ¢brates and
fasting in£uence mitochondrial activity, and that this action
occurs essentially at the level of the mitochondrial genome.
moreover, their in£uence on the amounts of mitochondrial
regulators, such as  xxxg2360xxx  and mt-ppar, is probably involved
in this regulation. in addition to a recent paper demonstrating
that there is a low reserve of cox activity in vivo [29], this
observation suggests that the in vivo control of respiration by

cox activity could be dependent on mitochondrial genome
encoded subunits.
