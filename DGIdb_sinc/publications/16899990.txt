abstract
we compared detailed efficacy of efonidipine and nifedipine, dihydropyridine analogues, and  xxxd2638xxx  using recombinant t- and l-type ca2+ channels expressed separately in mammalian cells. all these ca2+ channel antagonists
blocked t-type ca2+ channel currents (ica(t)) with distinct
blocking manners: ica(t) was blocked mainly by a tonic manner by nifedipine, by a use-dependent manner by  xxxd2638xxx , and by a combination of both manners by efonidipine.
ic50s of these ca2+ channel antagonists to ica(t) and l-type
ca2+ channel current (ica(l)) were 1.2 mol/l and 0.14 nmol/l
for nifedipine; 0.87 and 1.4 mol/l for  xxxd2638xxx , and
0.35 mol/l and 1.8 nmol/l for efonidipine, respectively.
efonidipine, a dihydropyridine analogue, showed high affinity to t-type ca2+ channel.

introduction

there are two types of functionally active voltage-dependent ca2+ channels, l- and t-type ca2+ channels,
which enable extracellular ca2+ to enter myocytes in human heart. ca2+ influx through the l-type ca2+ channel
plays a crucial role as a trigger of calcium-induced calcium release, which leads to excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes. several studies on structure,
physiology, and pharmacology of the l-type ca2+ channels have been published since the cloning of skeletal
muscle-type cdna [1–5], leading to the developments of
ca2+ channel blockers. because of these achievements,
tremendous numbers of patients with hypertension and/
or angina pectoris can benefit from ca2+ channel blockers. in 1998, cribbs et al. [6] succeeded in cloning cdna
of t-type ca2+ channel from human heart. among three
1 subunits of the t-type ca2+ channel, 1g, 1h and 1i,
northern analysis suggests that the 1i protein is expressed in brain, the 1g protein predominantly in brain
and less abundantly in heart, and the 1h protein abundantly in heart, kidney, and liver [6]. in human heart,
t-type ca2+ channels are thought to be located in pacemaker cells, and to contribute to the formation of pacemaker potential. expression of t-type ca2+ channels was
not detected in normal adult human ventricular myo-

materials and methods
expression of ca2+ channel proteins and cell culture
1h subunit ( xxxg308xxx ) derived from human heart which forms
cardiac t-type ca 2+ channel, was expressed in human embryonic
kidney (hek)-293 (hek- xxxg308xxx ) cells. a detailed profile and
procedure for channel expression were described in a previous
report [6]. briefly, cdna encoding human cardiac 1h subunit

( xxxg308xxx ) was inserted into the transfection vector pcdna3,
and hek-293 cells were transfected with 2 g of it using calcium
phosphate precipitation.
for the experiments on the l-type ca 2+ channel, baby hamster
kidney (bhk) cells and stably expressed cell line of  xxxg346xxx .2a into
the bhk cells (takashi yoshinaga, phd, tsukuba, japan) were
used; the preparation and profile were described previously in
detail [10]. cdnas of rabbit cardiac 1c subunit ( xxxg346xxx .2a) and rabbit skeletal muscular 1a, 2 and  subunits were subcloned into
the transfection vectors pk4kc,  xxxg1677xxx , and pcabe, respectively,
and transfections were stably performed on bhk cells by a modified calcium phosphate precipitation technique, using 5 g each
of them. a stable expression of 1c, 1a, and 2 subunit mrna
in bhk (bhk- xxxg304xxx ) cells was confirmed by northern blot analysis as described by hirano et al. [10].
recombinant hek- xxxg308xxx  and bhk- xxxg304xxx  cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml
streptomycin, in an atmosphere of 95% o2 + 5% co2 at 37 ° c.
this medium was supplemented with 300 g/ml  xxxg418xxx  (neomycin
analogue) for the selection of recombinant hek-293 cells, or
600 g/ml  xxxg418xxx  + 250 nmol/l methotrexate for the selection of
recombinant bhk cells.
whole-cell current recordings
recombinant cells were seeded onto glass-bottom dishes and
incubated in culture medium for 12–48 h before electrophysiological measurements. macroscopic ca 2+ channel currents were
recorded in whole-cell configuration using an epc-8 amplifier
(heka elektronik, lambrecht, germany), at room temperature
(20–23 ° c). patch pipettes were pulled from 75-mm plain capillary tubes (drummond scientific co., broomall, pa., usa) with

cytes [7, 8]. however, expression of t-type ca2+ channels
has been reported in ventricular myocytes of fetal heart
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [8]. moreover, in an animal model, re-expression of the t-type ca2+ channel was
confirmed after post-infarction remodeling [9]. detailed
research in pharmacology of t-type ca2+ channels would
make them a new target for therapeutic strategy for these
pathological conditions of the heart. from the viewpoint
of clinical medicine, it will be vitally important to identify potential t-type ca2+ channel blockers among the
marketed products.
here, we studied pharmacological properties of
t-type ca2+ channels consisting of 1h subunit ( xxxg308xxx ),
which were expressed on mammalian cells. we, therefore, identified the blocking actions of three different
ca2+ blockers on the t-type ca2+ channel in comparison
with those on the expressed cardiac l-type ca2+ channel.

had a resistance of 1.8–3.5 m when the pipette was filled with
the pipette solution. series resistance was compensated electrically, as much as possible, without oscillation (60–75%). capacitance was cancelled by built-in circuitry of the amplifier. current
signals were filtered at 3.3 khz and digitized  xxxd1891xxx  khz using the
itc-16 interface (instrutech corp., port washington, n.y.,
usa), and stored on a 90-mhz intel pentium-based computer using microsoft windows 95 operating system under control of a
data acquisition program, pulse/pulsefit (v. 8.11, heka elektronik). in all experiments, holding potential was maintained at
–100 mv. for the electrophysiological experiment of confirmation of expression (fig. 1), varied depolarizing step pulses were
applied. to investigate the channel availability (steady-state inactivation), conventional double-pulse protocol was applied: 100 ms
of test pulses at –40 mv (ica(t)) or +10 mv (ica(l)) following after
400 ms of prepulses from –100 to +150 mv (increment = 10 mv)
with 10 ms of interval were applied (table 1). for the preliminary
evaluation of effects of ca 2+ channel blockers (fig. 2), a square
pulse of –40 mv for 150 ms duration (ica(t)) or +10 mv for 500 ms
duration (ica(l)) was applied at a frequency of 0.1 hz. for the experiments aimed to identify blocking actions against ica(t) (fig. 3,
table 2), hek- xxxg308xxx  cells were stimulated with square pulses of
–40 mv for 150 ms duration at a frequency of 0.25 hz: cells were
kept at –100 mv without any stimulations for 5 min after application of each chemical, and successive square pulses were applied.
for the construction of dose-response curves (fig. 4), hek- xxxg308xxx 
cells were stimulated with test pulses of –40 mv at 0.1 hz, and
bhk- xxxg304xxx  cells were stimulated with test pulses of +10 mv at
0.1 hz. data were collected 5 min after application of chemicals.
each dataset was fitted by hill’s equation.
the voltage-dependent change of current was appreciated in
the conductance transforms, which are shown in table 1. relative

effects of ca2+ channel blockers
we applied three different ca2+ channel antagonists
on recombinant t- and l-type ca2+ channels. three
chemicals were included:  xxxd2638xxx , which was considered as a selective t-type ca2+ channel blocker [11–13];
16

pharmacology 2006;78:11–20

nifedipine, which was a representative dihydropyridine
analogue known to be a selective blocker of the l-type
ca2+ channel, and efonidipine, which was a member of
dihydropyridines with a blocking action on the t-type
ca2+ channel [14–16]. we applied each of these ca2+
channel antagonists with a very high concentration to
the recombinant t-type (fig. 2a) and l-type ca2+ channels (fig. 2b) as an initial dose. when hek- xxxg308xxx  cells
were stimulated with a square pulse of –40 mv from a
holding potential of –100 mv, a considerable amount of
ica(t) was inhibited by application of 1 mol/l  xxxd2638xxx ,
1 mol/l nifedipine, or 1 mol/l efonidipine (fig. 2a).
ica(l) expressed in bhk cells, which was evoked with a
square pulse of +10 mv, was inhibited by 1 mol/l  xxxd2638xxx , 0.1 nmol/l nifedipine, or 2 nmol/l efonidipine, although the dose of application was somewhat different.
time constants of activation and inactivation were not
varied by these ca2+ antagonists, except for the ica(l) inactivation time constant modified by nifedipine (table 1).
with ca2+ channel antagonists, activation and steadystate curves of ica(t) were significantly shifted to the hyperpolarized direction by 4.6, 4.0 and 6.1 mv for the activation curves, and 3.8, 4.5 and 2.7 mv for the steadystate inactivation curves, by  xxxd2638xxx , nifedipine, and
efonidipine, respectively. similar results were obtained
with these ca2+ channel antagonists in ica(l) (table 1).
these results indicate the abilities of these three ca2+
channel antagonists to inhibit both ica(t) and ica(l), although the efficacy of the blockade varied.
to evaluate the blocking properties of these ca2+ channel antagonists against ica(t), we stimulated the hekcav3.2 cells with a train of square pulses of –40 mv at
0.25 hz. figure 3a shows representative current traces
under the effect of three ca2+ channel antagonists. figure
3b and table 2 illustrate group data for the changes in the
peak ica(t) with or without the effect of these three ca2+
antagonists.  xxxd2638xxx  inhibited ica(t) by a small tonic
block action (17.8%) followed by a successive use-dependent block action (49.2%). on the other hand, nifedipine
inhibited ica(t) mainly by a tonic block action (45.9%),
whereas efonidipine inhibited ica(l) with a combination
of a moderate tonic block action (31.6%) and a use-dependent block action (44.9%).
it is of interest to compare the efficacy of these three
ca2+ antagonists in inhibition of the t- and l-type ca2+
channels. figure 4 illustrates dose-response curves of
 xxxd2638xxx , nifedipine, and efonidipine against ica(t) and
ica(l) evaluated by their tonic blocking actions.  xxxd2638xxx  inhibited ica(t) and ica(l) with ic50s of 0.87 and
1.4 mol/l, respectively. nifedipine inhibited ica(l) with

discussion

achievement of cdna cloning of l-type ca2+ channels has led us to explore the basic channel kinetics and
pharmacological actions of the channels in detail [1–3].
research on the t-type ca2+ channel has trailed that of
the l-type ca2+ channel. accordingly, in 1998, cribbs et
al. [6] succeeded in cdna cloning of the human 1h subunit, which corresponds to a type of cardiac t-type ca2+
channel. however, for the past two decades, many electrophysiological studies in the t-type ca2+ channel have
been activated by use of freshly isolated myocytes. in order to evaluate the t-type ca2+ channel current, either of
these methods has been utilized: subtraction of the currents from ones with much hyperpolarized holding potentials to one with depolarized holding potentials, or
abolishment of the l-type ca2+ channel current by a
purely selective l-type ca2+ channel antagonist. however, it is impossible to separate the accurate t-type ca2+
channel current from the l-type ca2+ channel by the
methods above, because of the following reasons. maximum depolarization voltage of f∞100% for the l-type ca2+
channel current is in the middle of the f∞ curve for the
t-type ca2+ channel current. in addition, there is no
purely selective antagonist on the t-type or the l-type
ca2+ channel. therefore, it is of great advantage to express the t-type and the l-type ca2+ channel in the heterologous system for the pharmacological evaluation of
the antagonist in detail.
 xxxd2638xxx  has been reported as a highly selective
t-type ca2+ channel blocker in previous studies [11–13],
whereas leuranguer et al. [17] reported that  xxxd2638xxx 
equally blocked both the l- and t-type ca2+ channels. in
order to address this controversy, it is important to study
the potential effects of conventional ca2+ channel antagonists upon the t-type ca2+ channel, because they have
been believed to be effective only on the l-type ca2+
channels. hence, we studied the actions of three different
commercially available ca2+ channel antagonists ( xxxd2638xxx , nifedipine, and efonidipine) on t-type ca2+ channel currents using recombinant channels, although  xxxd2638xxx  was withdrawn from the market in 2000 because of
adverse effects [18].  xxxd2638xxx , nifedipine and efonidipine at the same concentration (1 mol/l) were initially
inhibition of t- and l-type ca channels
by ca antagonists

applied to the recombinant t-type ca2+ channel for the
rough estimation of the blocking action (fig. 2). for the
same reason, the same concentration (1 mol/l) of these
three ca2+ channel antagonists was applied to the recombinant l-type ca2+ channel, because both solutions of
1 mol/l nifedipine and efonidipine were so concentrated
that they completely abolished the activation and inactivation phase of the current (data not shown). a lower
concentration of the drugs was used as shown in figure 2,
tables 1 and 2 for the evaluation of the modified kinetics
of the l-type ca2+ channel. these ca2+ channel antagonists did not significantly affect the time courses of activation and inactivation, except the minor changes in inactivation phase under the effect of nifedipine in ica(l).
therefore, we conclude that  xxxd2638xxx  and efonidipine
at the concentrations around ic50 have no significant effect on ca2+ current kinetics of activation and inactivation at these test potentials used (–40 mv for ica(t) and
+10 mv for ica(l)), whereas nifedipine at least accelerated
the inactivation of ica(l) probably favoring its inactivation
state (table 1). similarly to the well-known effect of dhp
block on ica(l), high doses of nifedipine, efonidipine and
 xxxd2638xxx  exert an additional effect on ica(t), which is to
alter the voltage range over which the t-type ca2+ channel operates by shifting toward more negative voltages in
both the steady-state inactivation and activation relations
(table 1).
various blocking actions of ca2+ channel antagonists
against the native l-type ca2+ channel in cardiac myocytes have already been recognized [19, 20]. most investigators report that dihydropyridines such as nifedipine
or  xxxd2737xxx , at concentrations that modify l-type
ca2+ channels, have little effect on t-type ca2+ channel
current. however, there are a few reports about effects of
conventional ca2+ channel antagonists against the t-type
ca2+ channel in cardiac myocytes [14, 15, 21], but not in
recombinant ica(t) in mammalian cells. based on this
background information, identification of the blocking
manner of ca2+ channel antagonist on the t-type ca2+
channel is of great pharmacological interest. actually, the
inhibition of l- and t-type ca2+ channels by efonidipine
is consistent with a previous study performed in xenopus
oocytes, albeit with lower potencies on the l-type ca2+
channel and the  xxxg307xxx -1g channel [16]. the reason for
the discrepancy between mammalian cell and oocyte effects of efonidipine on the ca2+ channels is unclear, although similar potency differences have been reported
for block of other channels [22]. although xenopus oocytes is a well-established method for expression of these
and other channels, a major limitation of this model is

a very low ic50 (0.14 nmol/l) on one hand, and ica(t) with
a moderate ic50 (1.2 mol/l) on the other hand. efonidipine inhibited ica(t) and ica(l) with ic50s of 0.35 mol/l
and 1.8 nmol/l, respectively.

leuranguer et al. [17] in rat cardiac l- and t-type ca2+
current. in contrast, potencies of nifedipine and efonidipine in inhibition of t- and l-type ca2+ channels were
distinct in terms of their selectivity. the ratio of ic50 for
ica(t) over ic50 for ica(l), was as much as 8,500 for nifedipine, and was 190 for efonidipine on their resting
blocking actions. in this study, ic50 values against ica(t)
and ica(l) (fig. 4) were evaluated only by a single electrophysiological protocol where the stimulation frequency
was 0.25 hz with a holding potential of –100 mv, neglecting possible voltage-dependent and/or use-dependent actions of drugs. because  xxxd2638xxx  and efonidipine have
relatively high use-dependent actions on ica(t) (table 2),
we might have underestimated their potencies in blocking ica(t). given that efonidipine, a member of dihydropyridines, has higher affinity to the t-type ca2+ channel
than does nifedipine, the difference may have clinical relevance to patients with hypertension. in most cases of
human therapeutic use, nifedipine increases heart rate by
baroceptor reflexes, indicating a complete compensation,
or even overcompensation, of the inhibitory effects on the
sinus node ca2+ channels. this reflex increase in heart
rate is not advantageous in patients with angina pectoris,
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and so forth [26]. unlike
the case in nifedipine, efonidipine has potent bradycardiac action when given in a therapeutic dose [27]. the
difference between the actions of two dihydropyridines
on the heart rate may be at least partially explained by the
high potency of efonidipine to inhibit  xxxg308xxx -channel,
because a proposed physiological role for cardiac t-type
ca2+ channel is a pacemaker current [28]. while the reported ic50 of nifedipine in blocking ica(l) ranged from
10 –8 to 10 –7 mol/l by experiments using non-recombinant
channel currents [12, 14, 29, 30], ic50 of nifedipine in this
study is rather low (0.14 nmol/l). hofmann et al. [31] indicated that (3h)isradipine bound to l-type ca2+ channels with affinity of 0.2 nmol/l using recombinant 1c-a
subunit on cho cells, which is roughly in agreement
with our result. on the other hand, by use of native t-type
ca2+ channels, early studies using 1–10 mol/l nifedipine
had shown selective block of l-type ca2+ channels with
little block of t-type ca2+ channels, concluding that there
was only a limited number of dihydropyridine subsets
that potentially block ica(t) [12, 14], whereas in this study,
nifedipine inhibits ica(t) with ic50 of 1.2 mol/l. taken
together, it is postulated that differences in experimental
protocols (e.g. stimulation frequency and holding potential), and/or by loss of some functional factors such as
subunit(s) and protein kinase activity, may be credited for
the evaluation of drug efficacy at least in the heterologous

that test substances can accumulate in the oocyte yolk,
resulting in significant variability and error in potency
estimates, even when compared to a positive control substance [22]. stable, mammalian cell lines expressing ion
channels, which are employed in this experiment, are
preferred for the evaluation of pharmacological agents
because they do not share this limitation.
 xxxd2638xxx  inhibited ica(t) mainly by the use-dependent manner, indicating the high affinity of the drug for
the activated and inactivated state of the channel, as
leuranguer et al. [17] and martin et al. [23] reported.
nifedipine inhibited ica(t) only by a tonic block action,
although with an extremely high concentration, contrary
to the case of  xxxd2638xxx , indicating that affinity of nifedipine to the resting state of the t-type ca2+ channel is
higher than that in activated and inactivated states. interestingly, tonic block action of nifedipine in the cardiac
l-type ca2+ channel has already been identified [20].
binding sites of dhp analogue ca2+ channel antagonists
in the l-type ca2+ channel have been detected by photo
affinity-labeling studies. according to the publication by
catterall and striessnig [24], dihydropyridines bind to
the transmembrane and pore region of repeats i, iii, and
iv. among them, the high-affinity binding site is formed
by eight l-type ca2+ channel-specific amino acids and
two conserved amino acids in repeats iii and iv. although the total homology between 1c and 1h is only
around 25%, both channels share 42% homology with
their pore regions in repeats iii and iv [6]. based on the
similarity in blocking action of nifedipine in the  xxxg304xxx 
channel and the  xxxg308xxx  channel, the high sequence homology between the high-affinity binding site of dihydropyridines in  xxxg304xxx  channels, and the corresponding
pore regions in the  xxxg308xxx  channel, it is postulated that
dihydropyridines bind to the pore region of repeats iii
and iv in the  xxxg308xxx  channel.
to determine whether commercially available ca2+
channel antagonists have the ability to block the t-type
ca2+ channel current at their therapeutic dose, blocking
actions of these three ca2+ channel antagonists were
compared by exploring the ic50s against t- and l-type
ca2+ channels (fig. 4).  xxxd2638xxx  inhibits ica(t) with ic50
of 0.87 mol/l, which is approximately similar to the values in previous reports [6, 17, 23, 25], and ica(l) with ic50
of 1.4 mol/l.  xxxd2638xxx  has been considered as a highly
selective t-type ca2+ channel blocker [11–13], however,
our results indicate that the potential of  xxxd2638xxx  in inhibition of the l- and t-type ca2+ channels is approximately identical, at least based on the resting blocking
action of the currents. a similar result was observed by

expression systems, which is one of the limitations of the
pharmacological evaluation of the ion channel current in
recombinant systems.
finally, caution is warranted in generalizing these data
to clinical application. although ic50s of ca2+ channel
antagonists for ica(t) were obtained by use of the human
recombinant 1h channel, ic50s for ica(l) were from the
rabbit recombinant 1c//2 channel. furthermore,
they were obtained by a fixed electrophysiological protocol yielding a tonic blocking action, which is not an equivalent clinical model for dose evaluation. additional investigations are needed to determine the precise selectivity of ca2+ channel antagonists on t- and l-type ca2+
channels in several experimental conditions mimicking
ventricular, atrial, and vascular smooth muscle cells excitation at fast or slow stimulation rates.

in conclusion, we studied effects of commercially
available ca2+ channel blockers against recombinant tand l-type ca2+ channels. we provide information on
three different ca2+ channel antagonists, nifedipine,
efonidipine, and  xxxd2638xxx , in distinct blocking action
of t- and l-type ca2+ channels. particularly efonidipine,
a dhp analogue, shows a high efficacy in blocking the
human t-type ca2+ channel, 1h.
