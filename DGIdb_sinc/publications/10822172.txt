abstract
the effect of the antiandrogen  xxxd2143xxx  on the prostatic  xxxg2417xxx  (vip) receptor/effector system was studied in rats. rats were s.c. injected with a daily dose of  xxxd2143xxx  (15 mg/kg b.w.) or vehicle for 14 days. drug treatment resulted
in histological evidence of gland involution and increased plasma membrane fluidity as estimated by fluorescence spectroscopy.
the number of vip receptors and the stimulatory effect of vip on adenylate cyclase activity in prostatic membranes decreased
in  xxxd2143xxx -treated rats. however, the pattern of  xxxd1742xxx  stimulation of the enzyme activity was not modified by this drug. androgen-receptor blockade by  xxxd2143xxx  also decreased the prostatic levels of ␣s, ␣i1/2, and ␣i3/0 g-protein subunits, as estimated by
an immunological procedure. whereas apoptotic dna fragmentation was evidenced in prostate from 3-day castrated animals, a
heterogeneous electrophoretic pattern was observed after  xxxd2143xxx  treatment. thus, androgen-receptor blockade by  xxxd2143xxx 
results in an important impairment of the components of the vip receptor/effector system in rat prostate as well as in a modification of their coupling extent, which is presumably due to differences observed in plasma membrane fluidity. these results represent a crosstalk in the prostate between two mechanisms of signal transduction involved in cell proliferation.  2000 elsevier

1. introduction
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the
male population and the second most common cause of
cancer death in the western world and the incidence appears to be increasing [1]. since the evidence [2] of the
hormone dependency of this disease, its treatment has
been aimed mainly either at inhibiting androgen secretion or interfering with its action at the prostate gland.
the current endocrine therapy for metastatic prostate
cancer includes surgical or chemical castration, either
alone or in combination with antiandrogen drugs, as
supported by the major regulatory role of androgens on
the proliferation and maintenance of function of prostate cells [3]. androgen ablation induces the cessation

of cell proliferation and the activation of apoptosis in
androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells [4], although
the treatment is only palliative and almost all patients
with advanced prostate carcinoma relapse because of
the development of androgen-independent cells [5].
 xxxd2143xxx  is a powerful and specific nonsteroidal
antiandrogen drug extensively used in the treatment of
advanced prostate cancer [6]. it inhibits responses to
male hormones from both the gonads and the adrenals
by acting at the androgen-receptor level and is essentially devoid of side effects other than those related to
hypoandrogenity [7]. either alone or in combination
with other drugs,  xxxd2143xxx  exerts an inhibitory role on
cell proliferation by preventing androgen action not
only in the prostate [6,7] but also at other levels such as
spermatogenesis [8] or bone formation [9]. interestingly, recent studies using  xxxd2143xxx  have indicated that
the  xxxg183xxx  can be activated through the
 xxxg1836xxx  pathway, as shown with either for-

skolin as direct activator of adenylate cyclase [10] or  xxxd2226xxx  ( xxxg930xxx ) as an
agent that requires previous binding to membrane receptor and stimulation of camp production [11]. the
crosstalk among the androgen pathway and not only the
 xxxg1836xxx  but also the protein kinase c pathways
[12,13], shows the great complexity of the cascade of
molecular events that regulates transcriptional activation through the  xxxg183xxx .
because the puzzle is far from being solved and bearing in mind the importance of the full characterization
of the effects of nonandrogenic therapeutic agents
which can affect the proliferation of prostate carcinoma,
we addressed the issue of the behaviour of the different
components of the receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase
pathway during prostate androgen-receptor blockade.
we chose the  xxxg2417xxx  (vip) receptor/effector system that has been well characterized in
both rat [14,15] and human [16] prostate. vip is a neuropeptide highly expressed in this gland [17]; it possesses a potential role in the invasive capacity of human
prostate cell lines [18] and has been involved in mechanisms of cell proliferation, differentiation, and pathogenesis [19]. we examined the properties of vip receptors and their functional coupling to adenylate cyclase
stimulation, as well as the levels of g-protein subunits,
in the involuting rat prostate during  xxxd2143xxx -induced
 xxxg183xxx  blockade. the occurrence of cell
apoptosis was estimated in parallel from the degree and
pattern of fragmentation of prostate dna.
2. materials and methods

2.3. histochemistry
for histochemistry, the rat ventral prostates were
fixed in 10% formaldehyde, in phosphate buffered saline (pbs) for 4 h at 4⬚c, washed thoroughly, dehydrated with an ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. seven micrometer sections were obtained.
histological aspects were examined in sirius red and
hematoxylin stained sections.
2.4. preparation of prostate plasma membranes
as previously described [20], rat prostate tissue was
homogenized in 25 mm triethanolamine-hcl buffer
(ph 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm pmsf, and
0.5 mm edta. after centrifugation at 600 ⫻ g for 10
minutes at 4⬚c, the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 25,000 ⫻ g for 30 min at
4⬚c. membranes were stored at ⫺80⬚c until use. protein
concentration was measured using bsa as a standard.
2.5. measurement of membrane fluidity
plasma membrane fluidity was estimated by fluorescence spectroscopy, using the fluorescent probe dph,
an all transpolyene system that partitions into the hydrophobic regions of membranes. the sample incubation and the polarization analysis were performed as
previously described [21]. excitation wavelength was
365 nm, and emission was recorded at 418 nm using a
perkin-elmer ls-3b spectrofluorometer. membrane
microviscosity was estimated by means of the relation
␩ ⫽ 2p/(0.46 – p) using the calculated polarization constant p [20].

2.1. materials

2.6. vip binding assay

vip was purchased from peninsula laboratories (st.
helens, uk).  xxxd2143xxx , atp, bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa), phenylmethylsulfonilfluoride (pmsf), 3⬘-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ), 1,6-diphenylhexatriene
(dph), and ethidium bromide were obtained from
sigma (alcobendas, spain). [125i]vip was prepared at a
specific activity of about 250 ci/g [14]. the antisera specific for g-protein subunits (rm/1 for ␣s, as/7 for ␣i1/2,
and ec/2 for ␣i3/0) were obtained from dupont-new
england nuclear (boston, ma, usa).

the experiments were carried out as reported elsewhere [16]. briefly, rat prostate membranes (0.1 mg
protein/ml) were incubated with 45 pm [125i]vip in 0.25
ml 50 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5) containing 1 mg/ml
bacitracin and 1.4% bsa in the absence and presence
of increasing concentrations of unlabelled vip. membrane-bound peptide was separated after 60 min incubation at 15⬚c and the radioactivity determined. nonspecific binding (about 1% of total radioactivity added,
as measured in the presence of 1 ␮m vip) was subtracted from total binding to obtain the specific binding.

2.2. animals and treatment
adult male wistar rats (about 300 g b.w.) were
maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle with water and
purina chow available ad libitum.  xxxd2143xxx  (15 mg/kg
b.w.) was injected daily (s.c.) in a sesame oil-ethanol
(9:1, v/v) vehicle (1 ml/kg b.w.) for 14 days. control
rats were injected with vehicle alone for 14 days (some
of them were castrated after 11 days via a scrotal incision under anaesthesia). rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and the ventral prostate was immediately removed and processed.

2.7. adenylate cyclase assay
the enzyme activity was assayed as previously described [20], with minor changes. membranes were incubated in 0.1 ml 25 mm triethanolamine-hcl buffer
(ph 7.4) containing 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , 5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1 mm
edta, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 10 ␮m gtp, 1.5 mm atp,
and an atp-regenerating system in the absence and
presence of test substances. the reaction was terminated after 10 min at 30⬚c by boiling for 3 min and refrigeration, followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of an alu-

313

mina slurry (0.25 g/ml in triethanolamine-hcl buffer,
ph 7.6). after centrifugation, the supernatant was
taken for the assay of  xxxd1773xxx  [22].
2.8. western blot analysis of g-protein subunits
as reported elsewhere [16], rat prostate membranes
were solubilized in 60 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 6.8)
containing 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromophenol blue,
and 3%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds). proteins were
electrophoresed in a sds-polyacrylamide gel and then
electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. thereafter, g-protein subunits were immunodetected [23] by using the antisera rm/1 (␣s), as/7 (␣1/2),
and ec/2 (␣i3/0).
2.9. agarose gel electrophoresis of apoptotic dna
the procedure was essentially that reported by kyprianou et al. [4]. briefly, dna was extracted from rat
prostate tissue by incubation in lysis buffer (10 ml/g)
with rnase dnase-free solution (10 mg/ml) at 37⬚c for
60 min. samples were deproteinized twice with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extraction. dna was precipitated overnight by 2 vol ice-cold  xxxd102xxx  at
⫺20⬚c. dna was quantified by spectrophotometry at
260 nm, after which aliquots were electrophoresed on a
2% agarose gel. a molecular weight marker (dna
fragments ranging in size fro 36 to 2645 base pairs) was
run in parallel. the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 ␮g/ml) and dna bands were visualized by
uv transillumination and photographed.
2.10 data processing and statistical analysis
data are derived from representative experiments,
each of which was repeated at least three times. numerical results are expressed as the means ⫾ s.e.m. where
appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using
student’s t-test and mann whitney test. binding data
were interpreted according to the method of scatchard
using the ebda program and the ligand nonlinear
curve-fitting program [24].
3. results
fourteeen days of  xxxd2143xxx  treatment resulted in
important morphological changes in the rat ventral
prostate, as assessed by sirius red and hematoxylin
staining of tissue sections (fig. 1). in control rats, prostate alveolar tubules exhibited thicker walls with
greater cells and more digitations as compared with  xxxd2143xxx -treated animals.
the histological changes observed in the involuting
rat prostate during  xxxd2143xxx -induced androgen-receptor blockade were accompanied by modifications in the
plasma membrane fluidity in this gland. the use of a
fluorescence spectroscopy technique indicated that  xxxd2143xxx  treatment led to an increased fluidity as shown

the binding of [125i]vip to rat prostate membranes
was competitively inhibited by increasing doses of the
unlabelled peptide in the two experimental groups considered (fig. 2). however,  xxxd2143xxx -induced androgen
blockade resulted in marked decreases in the extent of
vip binding. the scatchard analysis of the data gave
curvilinear plots (not shown) that were interpreted by a
computer program [24] in terms of two classes of vip
receptors possessing different affinities. table 1 shows
the corresponding stoichiometric parameters: in addition to some changes of the kd values of the high- and
low-affinity sites, the androgenic status determined the
number of vip receptors since the vip binding capacity
of both classes of receptors decreased by about 35%
after  xxxd2143xxx  treatment.
because the vip signalling pathway is functionally
coupled to stimulation of the adenylate cyclase system,

methods). values are means ⫾ s.e.m. of seven separate experiments

we studied the effect of increasing vip doses on this enzyme activity (fig. 3).  xxxd2143xxx  treatment was again
accompanied by decreased responses throughout the
range of vip concentrations tested as compared to control conditions so that the maximal stimulation reached
only about 60% of that in the control group. however,
the use of the diterpene  xxxd1742xxx , which is assumed to
act directly on the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase,
led to almost identical stimulatory patterns in prostate
membranes from both control and  xxxd2143xxx -treated
rats (fig. 4).
some experiments were carried out to explore the
consequences of  xxxd2143xxx  treatment upon prostate

subunits allowed us to identify two species of ␣s with 46

found with antibodies to ␣i1/2 or ␣i3/0 subunits. when
comparing with control rats, androgen-receptor blockade with  xxxd2143xxx  resulted in decreases of about 33%,
37%, and 24% of ␣s, ␣i1/2, and ␣i3/0 levels, respectively.

as expected, rapid castration-induced androgen
deprivation resulted in extensive apoptosis as characterized by typical fragmentation of genomic dna into
nucleosomal oligomers that are multiples of a 180nucleotide base-pair fragment (dna ladder) [4]. fig. 6
shows the apoptotic pattern for dna extracted from
regressing prostate glands of 3-day castrated rats. this
well established pattern was not observed with  xxxd2143xxx  since a diffuse, heterogeneous electrophoretic

vehicle administration, or 3 days after surgical castration. electrophoretic analysis of prostatic dna fragments was carried out as described in methods. the first lane corresponds to a molecular weight
marker with dna fragments ranging in size from 36 to 2645 base
pairs.

the present report shows that the number of vip receptors and the stimulatory effect of vip on adenylate
cyclase activity are markedly decreased in prostate
membranes from rats subjected to androgen-receptor
blockade by  xxxd2143xxx  treatment. the interest in the
use of the pure antiandrogen  xxxd2143xxx  in the palliative
therapy of advanced prostatic cancer [6,7] derives from
the fact that the combined blockade on androgens of
both testicular and adrenal sources achieved using  xxxd2143xxx  in association with castration gives better results
than the suppression of testicular androgens alone or
the treatment with  xxxd2143xxx  alone [25]. this role demands a better knowledge of the biological consequences of the antiandrogen action with a main projection to the routes involved in prostate cell proliferation
and death [8].
the hormonal pathways that regulate cell growth
and involution in the prostate are keys to the pathophysiology of the gland [26]. it is well recognized that
androgens play a main role in both the stimulation of
cell proliferation and the inhibition of the rate of cell
death in normal prostate epithelium and in androgensensitive prostate cancer cells [3,4,27]. in this study, androgen ablation by surgical castration resulted in extensive apoptosis as observed in 3-day castrated rats. this
is a recognized interval for maximal rates of cell loss
and detection of apoptotic parameters in the rat prostate gland because, in the third day alone after castration, the gland loses over 20% of its cells [28]. involution of the prostate gland was also evident during
 xxxd2143xxx  treatment as shown by histochemical studies
on tissue sections. the observation of a diffuse electrophoretic pattern for genomic dna, instead of a typical
dna ladder, after  xxxd2143xxx  treatment may be the consequence of some extent of chemical toxicity resulting
in necrosis that could mask apoptosis detection [29].
furthermore, whereas drugs that inhibit androgenic
steroid action initiate prostate shrinkage via apoptosis
of prostate epithelial cells, most drug regimens do not
appear to be as effective as surgical castration [30].
vip is a member of the complex array of hormones,
neurotransmitters, and growth factors that may participate in the growth and differentiation of the prostate
gland in concert with androgens [14,19]. previous data
indicate that vip stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity can be elicited in normal prostate epithelial cells and
in androgen-responsive (but not in non-responsive)
prostate cancer cells, suggesting the importance of androgen to the expression of vip receptors in this gland
[31]. our results demonstrate that the prostate vip re-

316

l. montalvo et al. / cellular signalling 12 (2000) 311–316

ceptor/adenylate cyclase system is retained during
gland involution after  xxxd2143xxx  treatment. however,
the number of vip receptors and the extent of the adenylate cyclase stimulation by this neuropeptide suffer
important decreases that are presumably related to a
more general decrease of protein synthesis in the prostate during gland regression [32].
present data indicate that the reduced expression of
the vip receptor/effector system is reached by  xxxd2143xxx  blocking of cellular binding of androgens to the
 xxxg183xxx  in the prostate. interestingly,  xxxd2143xxx  treatment did not modify the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by  xxxd1742xxx  (which acts directly
upon the catalytic subunit) but it increased plasma
membrane fluidity as estimated by fluorescence polarization of dph. this perturbation of ordered lipid domains surrounding integral proteins (i.e., membrane
receptors and effectors) may conceivably alter the coupling between the different components of the vip signal transduction system, which is in agreement with
present results. moreover,  xxxd2143xxx  elicited selective
alterations in gs and gi expression in the gland since ␣s
and ␣i1/2 levels decreased whereas those of ␣i3/0 did not
change with the antiandrogen. it is a new observation
on the complex molecular mechanisms of prostate involution, a process with some series of genes that are upor down-regulated [33].
in the present conditions, unlike the clearly apoptotic actions of castration, the effect of  xxxd2143xxx  on
cellular dna is mainly necrotic. in this case, it could be
thought that the decline in vip receptor binding as well
as vip-mediated adenylate cyclase activation may have
been due to more general effect of necrosis on overall
protein synthesis rather than the specific effect of  xxxd2143xxx  on vip receptor/effector. however, this possibility is unlikely because we observed selective modifications of adenylate cyclase (vip vs  xxxd1742xxx 
stimulation) and g-protein subunits (different extents
of impairment for ␣s, ␣i1/2, and ␣i3/0).
present results can be interpreted in terms of a consequence of  xxxg183xxx  blockade but also as a
support for the involvement of the neuropeptide vip
and the camp cascade of signal transduction in prostate cell proliferation. in fact, various previous studies
have shown the relationship of the adenylate cyclase
system with normal and tumour cell growth, although
the exact mechanisms are not fully understood [34,35].
the present observations are evidence of the crosstalk
between two classes of signal transduction pathways as
important as those of androgen receptors and membrane receptors/adenylate cyclase, ultimately affecting
the transcriptional regulation of genes. we have derived information that represents additional knowledge
on the mechanism of action of  xxxd2143xxx  that may serve
for further studies of the regulation of the growth, differentiation and cancer progression as well as of the po-

tential benefits of new drugs assayed for their antiandrogenic properties at the prostate level.
