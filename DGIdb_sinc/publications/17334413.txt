histamine regulates many functions by binding to four histamine g-coupled receptor proteins ( xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx ,  xxxg1080xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx ).
as  xxxg1080xxx  exerts their effects by coupling to gai/o proteins reducing adenosine 30 , 50 -monophosphate (camp) levels (a key
player in the modulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia/damage), we evaluated the role of  xxxg1080xxx  in the regulation of biliary
growth. we posed the following questions: (1) do cholangiocytes express  xxxg1080xxx ? (2) does in vivo administration of (r)-(a)()-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (ramh) ( xxxg1080xxx  agonist), thioperamide maleate ( xxxg1080xxx  antagonist) or histamine, in the
absence/presence of thioperamide maleate, to bile duct ligated (bdl) rats regulate cholangiocyte proliferation? and (3)
does ramh inhibit cholangiocyte proliferation by downregulation of camp-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase
a (pka)/ xxxg1369xxx /2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2)/ets-like gene-1 (elk-1)? the expression of  xxxg1080xxx  was evaluated in
liver sections by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, and by real-time pcr in cholangiocyte rna from
normal and bdl rats. bdl rats (immediately after bdl) were treated daily with ramh, thioperamide maleate or histamine
in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate for 1 week. following in vivo treatment of bdl rats with ramh for 1
week, and in vitro stimulation of bdl cholangiocytes with ramh, we evaluated cholangiocyte proliferation, camp levels
and pka,  xxxg1369xxx /2 and elk-1 phosphorylation. cholangiocytes from normal and bdl rats express  xxxg1080xxx . the expression of
 xxxg1080xxx  mrna increased in bdl compared to normal cholangiocytes. histamine decreased cholangiocyte growth of bdl rats
to a lower extent than that observed in bdl ramh-treated rats; histamine-induced inhibition of cholangiocyte growth
was partly blocked by thioperamide maleate. in bdl rats treated with thioperamide maleate, cholangiocyte hyperplasia
was slightly higher than that of bdl rats. in vitro, ramh inhibited the proliferation of bdl cholangiocytes. ramh inhibition
of cholangiocyte growth was associated with decreased camp levels and pka/ xxxg1369xxx /2/elk-1 phosphorylation. downregulation of camp-dependent pka/ xxxg1369xxx /2/elk-1 phosphorylation (by activation of  xxxg1080xxx ) is important in the inhibition of
cholangiocyte growth in liver diseases.

histamine regulation of cholangiocyte growth
h francis et al

regulation of cholangiocyte growth/loss.2,3,5 although increased camp levels sustain cholangiocyte proliferation,
decreased camp formation results in a reduction of
cholangiocyte hyperplasia.2,3,5
the aminergic peptide histamine is responsible for many
functions in the body such as neurogenic functions, inflammatory responses, allergic responses and gastric secretion.11–13 four g-protein coupled histamine receptors (hrs)
( xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx ,  xxxg1080xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx ) exist.14,15 although  xxxg1078xxx  act via
 xxxg923xxx  mobilizing [ca2 þ ]i,16 the activation of  xxxg1079xxx  is modulated by gas proteins, coupled to adenylyl cyclase.17  xxxg1080xxx 
were first noted as presynaptic autoreceptors on brain histamine neurons, although they were also found in other
cells.18,19 cloning and functional characterization of the
human and rat  xxxg1080xxx  cdna show that this receptor belongs to
the family of g-protein-coupled receptors.20,21 these early
studies demonstrated that  xxxg1080xxx  agonists decrease forskolindependent camp accumulation.21 recently,  xxxg1081xxx  were
cloned.22 this receptor is over 35% homologous to the  xxxg1080xxx 
and appears to have similar functions, such as its ability to
inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp levels (although not as
potently as the  xxxg1080xxx ) in bone marrow cells.22
the rationale for studying the role of  xxxg1080xxx  in the regulation of cholangiocyte growth in bdl rats is first based on the
fact that  xxxg1080xxx  exerts their effects by coupling to gai/o proteins
with inhibition of adenylyl cyclase,21,22 a key factor in the
regulation of cholangiocyte growth.1–3,5 the aims of our
study were to: (i) evaluate the presence of  xxxg1080xxx  protein in bile
ducts from normal and bdl rat liver sections; (ii) study the
expression of  xxxg1080xxx  mrna in purified cholangiocytes from
normal and bdl rats; (iii) determine the in vivo effect of (a)
the  xxxg1080xxx  agonist, (r)-(a)-()-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (ramh),23,24 (b) the h3 hr antagonist, thioperamide maleate25,26 and (c) histamine, in the absence or
presence of thioperamide maleate, on cholangiocyte proliferation in bdl rats; and (iv) to elucidate, in purified bdl
cholangiocytes, the transduction mechanisms by which
ramh regulates the proliferation of these cells.

animal model
male fisher 344 rats (150–175 g) were purchased from
charles river (wilmington, ma, usa). animals were kept in
a temperature-controlled environment (221c) with a 12-h
light–dark cycle. the studies were conducted in: (i) normal
rats treated with nacl (vehicle) or ramh (10 mg/kg body
weight/day)23,24 for 1 week; and (ii) bdl rats that, immediately after bdl,27 were treated for 1 week with daily i.p.
injections of nacl, ramh (10 mg/kg body weight/day),28
thioperamide maleate (5 mg/kg body weight)25,26 or histamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight)15,29 in the absence or presence
of thioperamide maleate for 1 week. the doses of ramh,
thioperamide maleate and histamine used in the present
studies were similar to those used in other studies in
rodents.15,25,26,28,29 liver blocks, serum and cholangiocytes
were obtained at the end of the selected treatments. we
evaluated body and liver weight from the selected groups of
animals. before each procedure, animals were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight ip). in
vitro studies were performed in purified cholangiocytes from
1-week bdl rats stimulated with 0.2% bsa (basal) or ramh
(10 mm). all animals received humane care according to the
criteria outlined in the ‘guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals’ prepared by the national academy of
sciences and published by the national institutes of health
and under local iacuc approval.
purification of cholangiocytes
cholangiocytes were purified by immunoaffinity separation30
utilizing a monoclonal antibody (igm, kindly provided by
dr r faris, brown university, providence, ri, usa) against
an unidentified antigen expressed by all intrahepatic
cholangiocytes.30 cell viability (approximately 97%) was
determined by trypan blue exclusion. purity (98–99%) of
cholangiocytes was assessed by g-gt histochemistry.31
expression of h3 histamine receptors
immunohistochemistry for  xxxg1080xxx  was performed in frozen
sections (6 mm thick; n ¼ 3 per each group of animals) pretreated with cold acetone for 10 min, followed by endogenous
peroxidase quenching for 5 min with methanol-peroxide solution (0.3%  xxxd2298xxx , santoku chemical
industries, tokyo, japan) in 80% methanol (wako, osaka,
japan). after washing with cold 1  phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs), sections were incubated with a specific  xxxg1080xxx 
antibody (c20, goat polyclonal, dilution, 1:100) or non-immune serum (negative control) at 41c overnight. after rinsing with 1  pbs, histofine simple stain max po (nichirei,
tokyo, japan) was added as secondary antibody for 1 h at
room temperature. nuclear counterstaining was performed
by hematoxylin for light micrographs after detecting reactions with vector novared (vector laboratories, inc.,
burlingame, ca, usa).

bdl rats was performed as follows. samples were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (in 1  pbs) for 10 min, followed by tissue
permeabilization in pbst (1  pbs containing 0.2% triton
x-100). nonspecific protein binding was blocked by 5%
normal goat serum. following incubation with a primary
antibody against  xxxg1080xxx  (raised in goat, 1:5; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa) or non-immune goat
serum (negative control), together with an anticytokeratin-19
( xxxg1288xxx ) antibody (raised in mouse, 1:50; vision biosystems
inc., norwell, ma, usa), samples were rinsed with 1  pbs
and subsequently incubated with cy2-conjugated anti-mouse
and cy3-conjugated anti-goat antibodies (both diluted at
1:50, jackson immunochemicals, west grove, pa, usa)
following immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence,
samples were observed either with the light microscope
eclipse e600 (nikon, kawasaki, japan) or an olympus
ix71 inverted confocal microscope.
for immunofluorescence for  xxxg1080xxx  in cholangiocyte
smears from normal and bdl rats, samples were pretreated
with cold acetone for 10 min, followed by blocking of
nonspecific protein binding using normal goat serum.
following incubation with the  xxxg1080xxx  antibody or nonimmune
serum (negative control), samples were rinsed with 1  pbs
and subsequently incubated with alexa 488-conjugated antigoat antibody (dilution, 1:100, molecular probes, eugene,
or, usa) as secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. following immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence, samples were observed either with the light
microscope eclipse e600 (nikon, kawasaki, japan) or
fluorescence microscope dmrxa/hc (leica, tokyo,
japan).
to evaluate the expression of  xxxg1080xxx  mrna in total cholangiocyte rna (0.75 mg) from normal and bdl rats, we
employed the rt2 real-time assay from superarray (frederick, md, usa). rna was extracted utilizing the rneasy mini
kit (qiagen inc., valencia, ca, usa) according to the instructions provided by the vendor. rna was extracted from
normal and bdl cholangiocytes (1  105) and reverse transcribed using the reaction readyt first strand cdna
synthesis kit (superarray, frederick, md, usa). these reactions were then used as templates for the pcr assays. sybr
green pcr master mix was utilized in the experimental assay.
one microliter of previously prepared template was added to
12.5 ml of master mix, 10.5 ml of di water and 1 ml of rt2 pcr
rat primers (superarray, frederick, md, usa) designed
specifically for the messages for  xxxg1080xxx  and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ), the housekeeping
gene.32 the plate was then placed in the real-time thermal
cycler (abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system) and
run on a two-step pcr cycling program for 951c for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles of 951c for 15 s and 601c for 1 min.
a ddct analysis was performed using the normal pooled
cholangiocytes as the control sample. data were expressed
as relative mrna levels7s.e.m. of  xxxg1080xxx  to  xxxg861xxx  ratio
(n ¼ 3).

in vivo studies
evaluation of liver, body weight and liver to body weight ratio,
necrosis, lobular damage, and histamine, transaminase and
bilirubin serum levels and cholangiocyte apoptosis
in the selected groups of animals, we evaluated the changes in
necrosis, lobular morphology (disarrangement of hepatocytes), histamine, transaminases and bilirubin serum levels,
and cholangiocyte apoptosis.
ten randomly selected portal areas, as well as surrounding
lobular areas, were evaluated using light microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections (5 mm thick, 3 sections
evaluated per each group of animal). for quantification of
damage, the following categories were applied: 0, null; 1,
limited to portal area; 2, intermediate; and 3, pan lobular.
liver sections were examined in a coded fashion by light
microscopy with an olympus bx-40 (tokyo, japan) microscope equipped with a camera. histamine serum levels of
normal and bdl rats were evaluated by commercially available eia kits (cayman chemical). to evaluate liver damage,
serum samples from bdl rats, treated with nacl or ramh
for 1 week, were analyzed for transaminases (aspartate
transaminase (ast) and  xxxg941xxx  (alt)) and
direct bilirubin. transaminases and direct bilirubin levels
were measured using a dimensions rxl max* integrated
chemistry system (dade behring inc., deerfield, il, usa).
we evaluated cholangiocyte apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dutp nick end labeling
(tunel) analysis33 in paraffin-embedded liver sections
(5 mm, three slides evaluated for each group) from the selected group of animals. following counterstaining with hematoxylin solution, liver sections were examined by light
microscopy with an olympus bx-40 microscope (tokyo,
japan) equipped with a camera. approximately 100 cells per
slide were counted in a coded fashion in 10 non-overlapping
fields.

evaluation of cholangiocyte proliferation and camp levels
to evaluate the effects of ramh, thioperamide maleate or
histamine (in the absence or presence of thioperamide
maleate) on cholangiocyte proliferation, we measured the
number of proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (pcna)and  xxxg1288xxx -positive cholangiocytes (by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded sections, 5 mm thick, three
slides analyzed per animal, n ¼ 2 animals)34 and g-gt-positive ducts (by histochemistry in frozen sections, 5 mm thick,
three slides analyzed per animal, n ¼ 2 animals)31 in sections
from the selected group of animals. following staining, slides
were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined in a
coded fashion with an eclipse e6000 microscope (nikon,
japan). data were expressed as number of pcna- or ck-19positive cholangiocytes per 100 cholangiocytes. for g-gt
staining, data were expressed as % bile duct volume per each
portal tract examined (10 randomly selected portal areas
were evaluated).

we measured pcna (an index of cell replication)33 protein
expression by immunoblots in protein (10 mg) whole-cell
lysate from brain (positive control) or purified cholangiocytes from bdl rats treated with nacl or ramh for 1 week.
proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence (ecl plus
kit, amersham life science). blots were normalized against
the housekeeping protein, b-actin.35 the intensity of the
bands was determined by scanning video densitometry using
the phospho-imager, storm 860, amersham biosciences
(piscataway, nj, usa) using the imagequant tlv 2003.02.
we measured intracellular basal camp levels (a key regulatory determinant of cellular proliferation including ductal
hyperplasia)5,36,37 in purified cholangiocytes from normal or
bdl rats, which immediately after bdl, were treated with
nacl- or ramh for 1 week. after purification, cholangiocytes were incubated for 1 h at 371c to restore surface

proteins damaged by treatment with proteolytic enzymes.38
in each experiment, 0.5 mm 3- xxxd2388xxx , a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was added. following ethanol
extraction, basal camp levels were measured by radioimmunoassay using commercial kits (amersham) according
to the instructions supplied by the vendor.
evaluation of the phosphorylation of the pka- xxxg1369xxx /2-elk-1
signaling pathway
as ramh did not alter the growth of normal cholangiocytes,
we evaluated the effect of ramh for changes in the phosphorylation of the pka-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2)-ets-like gene-1 (elk-1) signaling
pathway only in bdl cholangiocytes. the expression levels of
phosphorylated pka- xxxg1369xxx /2-elk-1 in cholangiocytes
from nacl and ramh-treated bdl rats were evaluated by

figure 1 immunohistochemistry for  xxxg1080xxx  in paraffin-embedded liver sections from normal and 1-week bdl rats. by immunohistochemistry (scale
bar ¼ 50 mm), there was cytoplasmic and membranous staining for  xxxg1080xxx  in cholangiocytes from normal and bdl rats.  xxxg1080xxx  were also expressed by
hepatocytes from normal and bdl rats. no immunohistochemical reaction was observed when normal or bdl liver sections were incubated with
non-immune serum.

protein expression of total pka- xxxg1369xxx /2-elk-1. proteins
were visualized using chemiluminescence (ecl plus kit,
amersham life science). the intensity of the bands was
determined by scanning video densitometry using the
phospho-imager, storm 860, amersham biosciences using
the imagequant tlv 2003.02.
in vitro studies
to determine if the effects of ramh on cholangiocyte proliferation, camp levels and the phosphorylation of campdependent pka- xxxg1369xxx /2-elk-1 are due to a direct interaction of ramh with  xxxg1080xxx  on cholangiocytes (rather than an
indirect action), purified cholangiocytes from 1 week bdl
rats were treated in vitro with 0.2% bsa (basal) or ramh
(10 mm). cholangiocyte proliferation was evaluated by pcna
protein expression by immunoblotting in cholangiocytes
stimulated at 371c for 3 h with 0.2% bsa (basal) or ramh
(10 mm). the amount of protein loaded was normalized
against b-actin.35 proteins (10 mg) were visualized using
chemiluminescence (ecl plus kit, amersham life science).
the intensity of the bands was determined by scanning video
densitometry using the phospho-imager, storm 860, amersham biosciences using the imagequant tlv 2003.02.
following incubation at 371c for 1 h, intracellular camp
levels (a key player in the regulation of cholangiocyte
hyperplasia)1–3,5 were determined in cells treated at room
temperature for 5 min38,39 with (i) 0.2% bsa or (ii) ramh
(10 mm) in the absence or presence of pertussis toxin (ptx)
(1 mm).40 to determine that ramh has no effect on the gao
activated signaling pathway (phospholipase c/ip3/ca2 þ /
pkca-dependent pathway),41,42 we measured intracellular
ip3 levels in cholangiocytes stimulated at room temperature
for 10 min43 with (i) 0.2% bsa or (ii) ramh (10 mm). intracellular camp and ip3 levels were determined by ria
(amersham) according to directions supplied by the vendor.
we evaluated, by immunoblots, the effects of ramh on
the phosphorylation of pka- xxxg1369xxx /2-elk-1 in protein
(10 mg) from whole-cell lysate from cholangiocytes stimulated with (i) 0.2% bsa or (ii) ramh (10 mm) for 90 min at
371c. after stripping, immunoblots were normalized with
total amounts from each protein. proteins (10 mg) were visualized using chemiluminescence (ecl plus kit, amersham
life science). the intensity of the bands was determined by
scanning video densitometry using the phospho-imager,
storm 860, amersham biosciences using the imagequant
tlv 2003.02.
statistical analysis
all data are expressed as mean7s.e.m. the differences between groups were analyzed by student’s t-test when two
groups were analyzed, or analysis of variance (anova) if
more than two groups were analyzed. a p-value o0.05 was

results
cholangiocytes express h3 histamine receptors
we performed immunohistochemistry (figure 1) and immunofluorescence (figure 2) for  xxxg1080xxx  in liver sections from
normal and bdl rats and present cytoplasmic and membranous staining in cholangiocytes. by immunofluorescence,
 xxxg1080xxx  immunoreactivity was colocalized with the expression
of  xxxg1288xxx  (as a marker of cholangiocytes)39 (figure 2).  xxxg1080xxx 
were also expressed by hepatocytes from normal and bdl
rats (figures 1 and 2). no immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent reaction was observed when liver sections
were incubated with non-immune serum (figures 1 and 2).
by immunofluorescence, we have shown that smears of isolated cholangiocytes from both normal and bdl rats express
 xxxg1080xxx  (figure 3a). by real-time pcr, we found that: (i) normal cholangiocytes express  xxxg1080xxx  mrna (figure 3b) and (ii)
the expression of  xxxg1080xxx  mrna significantly increased in
cholangiocytes from bdl rats (figure 3b).

chronic in vivo administration of ramh decreases
cholangiocyte proliferation
in bdl rats, chronic ramh administration decreased the
number of pcna-positive cholangiocytes in liver sections
compared to liver sections from rats receiving nacl (figure
4). similarly, there was a significant decrease in the number
of  xxxg1288xxx -positive cholangiocytes (figure 5) and g-gt-positive ducts (figure 6) in liver sections compared to liver
sections from nacl-treated bdl rats. similar to ramh,
the administration of histamine to bdl rats significantly
decreased the number of pcna- and  xxxg1288xxx -positive
cholangiocytes (figures 4 and 5) and g-gt-positive ducts
(figure 6) in liver sections compared to liver sections from
bdl rats treated with nacl; however, the decrease in cholangiocyte growth (by histamine administration alone) was
smaller than that observed in bdl rats treated with ramh
(figures 4–6). consistent with the concept that  xxxg1080xxx  regulate
cholangiocyte growth of bdl rats, histamine inhibition of
cholangiocyte growth was partly blocked by thioperamide
maleate (figures 4–6); however, in the bdl rats treated with
histamine þ thioperamide maleate, cholangiocyte growth was
still significantly lower than that of bdl rats (figures 4–6). in
bdl rats treated with thioperamide maleate, cholangiocyte
proliferation and ductal hyperplasia was slightly higher (although not significant) than that of bdl rats (figures 4–6).
pcna protein expression was also decreased in cholangiocytes purified from bdl rats treated with ramh compared
to cholangiocytes from nacl-treated bdl rats (figure 7a).
chronic administration of ramh to normal rats had no
effect on the number of pcna- or  xxxg1288xxx -positive cholangiocytes or g-gt-positive ducts compared to normal rats
receiving nacl (not shown).
consistent with the concept that decreased cholangiocyte
proliferation is associated with reduced camp levels (a key
regulator of cholangiocyte proliferation),1–3,5 in vivo treatment of bdl rats with ramh significantly (po0.05) decreased intracellular camp levels (82.9775.50 fmol/1  105
cells, n ¼ 7) of purified cholangiocytes compared to cholangiocyte camp levels from nacl-treated bdl rats
(111.1078.57 fmol/1  105 cells, n ¼ 7). administration of
ramh to normal rats did not alter camp levels of cholangiocytes compared to cholangiocytes from normal rats
treated with nacl (not shown).

discussion
the findings of our study demonstrate that the activation of
the specific  xxxg1080xxx  on cholangiocytes inhibits biliary proliferation induced by bdl.27 similar to ramh, the administration of histamine to bdl rats significantly decreased
cholangiocyte proliferation compared to bdl rats treated
with nacl; however, the decrease in cholangiocyte growth (by
administration of histamine alone) was smaller than that
observed in bdl rats treated with ramh. histamine inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was partly blocked by
thioperamide maleate. in bdl rats treated with thioperamide
maleate, ductal hyperplasia was slightly higher (although not
significant) than that observed in bdl rats treated with nacl.

in vitro, ramh inhibited the proliferation of bdl cholangiocytes. the in vivo and in vitro ramh-induced
inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was mediated by a campdependent decrease of the phosphorylation of pkaerk1/2-elk-1.
the mechanism by which cholangiopathies develop and
progress towards ductopenia is unclear.45 a major event to be
considered is the impairment of the proliferative response of
cholangiocytes, which involves apoptotic cell death.1,45,46
apoptosis of cholangiocytes in the course of primary biliary
cirrhosis (pbc) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (the two
most common of the cholangiopathies)1,45 has been associated with the local release of mediators by cells of the immune system.47–49 indeed, some of those mediators like nitric
oxide and cytokines have been shown to affect cholangiocyte
biology.50 furthermore, in chronic liver diseases including
pbc there is increased number of mast cells,51 which causes a

local increase of histamine.51 moreover, histamine serum
levels are increased in patients with chronic cholestatic liver
diseases.52 our findings are relevant to these cholangiopathies, as we have demonstrated that histamine, increased
histamine serum levels and activation of  xxxg1080xxx  modulate the
proliferative response of cholangiocytes to cholestasis.
bdl-induced cholangiocyte proliferation is characterized
by increased intrahepatic ductal mass27 compared to normal
rats. in our study, chronic in vivo administration of ramh
to bdl rats decreased the number of bile ducts compared to
nacl-treated bdl rats. in support of our findings, studies
have shown that hr agonists regulate mitosis in other cell
types.53–55 for example, ramh stimulates cell proliferation
and migration in rat oxyntic mucosa.55 conversely, our
present studies demonstrated that ramh inhibits, both in
vivo and in vitro, hyperplastic cholangiocyte proliferation of
bdl rats. this difference between the inhibitory effects of
ramh observed in cholangiocytes and the stimulatory effect
of this  xxxg1080xxx  agonist on rat oxyntic mucosa55 is likely due to
482

the different cell target. in support of this concept, studies
have shown that gastrin induces the growth of normal56 and
neoplastic tissues,57 but inhibits the hyperplastic growth of
bdl cholangiocytes2 and the neoplastic growth of biliary58
and pancreatic59 cancers.
histamine is known to interact with four receptor
subtypes.14,15 thus, we performed a series of experiments to
pinpoint the role of the  xxxg1080xxx  in histamine modulation of
cholangiocyte proliferative response to cholestasis. we
observed that the in vivo administration of ramh to bdl
rats decreased cholangiocyte growth to a higher extent
compared to histamine. these results suggest that endogenous histamine also interacts with other hrs, exerting
an opposite, pro-proliferative effect. in this regard, we have
shown that the activation of  xxxg1078xxx  and  xxxg1079xxx  enhances normal
cholangiocyte growth.60 the findings of our current study
show that when bdl rats are administered with the  xxxg1080xxx 
selective antagonist, thioperamide maleate, the increase of
bile duct mass in reaction to cholestasis is higher (although
not significant) than bdl rats. as  xxxg1080xxx  are also expressed by
hepatocytes, there may indeed be some interactions between
cholangiocytes and hepatocytes to modulate the in vivo effects of  xxxg1080xxx  on cholangiocyte proliferation. however, because we have shown that the inhibition of ramh on
cholangiocyte proliferation occurs in vitro, using a cholangiocyte isolation procedure that excludes hepatocytes, we
demonstrated that the in vivo inhibition of ramh on cholangiocyte growth is a direct effect rather than an effect
mediated by hepatocytes.
we evaluated the effect of chronic administration of
ramh on lobular damage, cholangiocyte apoptosis and
bilirubin and transaminase serum levels and showed that
ramh ameliorates lobular damage and decreases the serum
levels of bilirubin and ast compared to bdl rats treated
with nacl. supporting our present study, earlier studies have
shown that the pro-drug of ramh reduced the necrotic
changes induced by ccl4 treatment and inhibited the increase of plasma ast and alt activities.61 similarly, pretreatment with histamine ameliorated the d-galactosamine/
lipopolysaccharide-induced necrotic and apoptotic changes
in the hepatocytes and inhibited the elevation of serum ast
levels.62
we next: (i) performed in vitro studies to demonstrate that
ramh inhibits cholangiocyte proliferation by directly
interacting with  xxxg1080xxx ; and (ii) evaluated the intracellular
mechanisms by demonstrating that ramh-inhibition of
cholangiocyte growth is associated with changes in the
camp-dependent pka/ xxxg1369xxx /2/elk-1 pathway, which regulates the mitosis of a number of cells including cholangiocytes.5,10,63 camp accumulation is linked to gas stimulation
inducing increased cell proliferation.64 in contrast, when the
gai protein is activated there is a negative regulation of
camp that leads to decreased proliferation via downregulation of pka and the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) pathway.64 previous studies have shown that

increased cholangiocyte growth is closely coupled with
enhanced camp levels,5,39,65 whereas reduced cholangiocyte
proliferation is associated with decreased camp levels.66
maintenance of camp levels by the administration of  xxxd1742xxx  or b1- and b2-adrenergic receptor agonists prevents
the stimulatory effects of cholinergic or adrenergic denervation, respectively, on cholangiocyte apoptosis.34,65 furthermore, upregulation of the camp system (by chronic  xxxd1742xxx 
administration) alone is sufficient to induce cholangiocyte
hyperplasia in normal rats, similar to the bdl rat model.5
our study shows that chronic administration of the  xxxg1080xxx 
agonist, ramh to bdl rats induced a decrease in cholangiocyte camp levels compared to camp levels of cholangiocytes from bdl rats treated with nacl. similarly,
in vitro, ramh induced a decrease in intracellular camp
levels that was abolished by pretreatment with the general
gi-protein inhibitor, ptx,67 demonstrating a gai, pka-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and camp levels. in
support of this concept, recent studies have shown that: (i)
h3 receptor agonists decrease  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp
levels;21 and (ii) stimulation of [35s]gtpg[s] binding
through h3 receptor agonists in cerebral cortical membranes
is prevented by ptx.68

camp-dependent pka regulation of cell growth involves
signaling by the specific map kinase,  xxxg1369xxx /2.69 this effect,
however, is determined by the type of cells involved and can
entail either positive or negative regulation. histamine has
484

been shown to increase  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapkinase activity in vascular smooth muscle70 and, specifically, the  xxxg1078xxx  also induces
an increase in phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in bovine adrenal
chromaffin cells.71 in our study, involvement of camp/pka
in the anti-proliferative effects of histamine (via the  xxxg1080xxx 
agonist) is further supported by our findings that ramh
decreases active site phosphorylation for  xxxg1369xxx /2. to further
elucidate the mechanisms regulating the inhibition of proliferation by ramh, we evaluated the role of elk-1, a
member of the ets-domain family of transcription factors.72
studies in human glioblastoma cells show: (i) protein kinase
b inhibits elk-1 expression by downregulation of the mekerk pathway;73 and (ii) activation and nuclear translocation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 induces activation of elk-1.74 parallel with these
findings,73,74 we demonstrated that the reduction of  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation by ramh results in decreased elk-1 phosphorylation.
in summary, we propose that in cholestatic liver diseases
(eg, after bdl) cholangiocyte proliferation is regulated by a
fine balance between the stimulatory (by activation of  xxxg1078xxx 
and  xxxg1079xxx ) and inhibitory (by activation of  xxxg1080xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx )
effects of endogenous histamine. this study indicates that the
excessive proliferation of cholangiocytes in the course of
cholestatic liver diseases could be counterbalanced by the
selective activation of  xxxg1080xxx , which mediate inhibition of
intrahepatic ductal mass.
