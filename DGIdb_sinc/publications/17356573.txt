the therapeutic effects of chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are well documented, yet the elementary behavioral
processes that are affected by such treatment have not been fully investigated. we report here the effects of chronic fluoxetine
treatment and genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter (sert) on food reinforced behavior in three paradigms: the progressive ratio
operant task, the concurrent choice operant task, and the pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task. we consistently find that chronic
pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of sert result in similar behavioral consequences: reduced operant responding for natural
reward. this is in line with previous studies reporting declines in operant responding for drugs and intracranial self-stimulation with
fluoxetine treatment, suggesting that the effect of sert blockade can be generalized to different reward types. detailed analyses of
behavioral parameters indicate that this reduction in operant responding affect both goal-directed and non-goal-directed behaviors
without affecting the pavlovian cue-triggered excessive operant responding. in addition, both pharmacological and genetic manipulations
reduce locomotor activity in the open field novel environment. our data contrast with the effect of dopamine in increasing operant
responding for natural reward specifically in goal-directed behaviors and in increasing pavlovian cue-triggered excessive operant
responding. serotonin and dopamine have been proposed to serve opposing functions in motivational processes. our data suggest that
their interactions do not result in simple opponency. the fact that pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of sert have similar
behavioral consequences reinforces the utility of the sert null mice for investigation of the mechanisms underlying chronic ssris
treatment.

introduction
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are the most
frequently prescribed antidepressants; they display therapeutic effects when used chronically, but not acutely. the
main site of action of ssris is thought to be the serotonin
transporter (sert), which is responsible for reuptake and
recycling of released serotonin (hirschfeld, 2000; owens,
2004). blockade of sert by ssris and the resultant
elevation in extracellular serotonin levels are thought to
mediate the therapeutic effects of ssris (bergqvist et al,
1999; cryan et al, 2005). yet the underlying neurobiological
mechanisms and elementary behavioral processes associated with ssris’ apparent therapeutic or side effects have
not been fully investigated.

one of the elementary behavioral processes that might be
affected by ssris is motivation, which can be operationally
defined as an animal’s willingness to expend energy to
obtain a reward or avoid punishment. many studies have
investigated the effects of ssris on operant responses in
intracranial self-stimulation (icss) or drug self-administration paradigms. the most consistent finding was that ssris
reduced responding for these reinforcers, or shifted it in
ways that indicated reductions in motivation (carroll et al,
1990; richardson and roberts, 1991; tella, 1995; lee and
kornetsky, 1998; wilson et al, 2000; harrison et al, 2001;
harrison and markou, 2001). however, there are limited
studies that examine the influence of ssris on responding
for natural rewards such as food. studies that use natural
rewards have mostly focused on the role of serotonin in
impulsivity (bizot et al, 1999; joel et al, 2004; winstanley
et al, 2004) rather than on motivation or reinforcement
learning processes.
in addition to sert pharmacologic blockade, mice with a
genetic deletion of the sert have been generated. they
display molecular changes similar to those observed with
chronic ssri treatment, although to a significantly greater
magnitude (bengel et al, 1998; sora et al, 1998; lira et al,

5-ht reduces operant responding for reward
ac sanders et al

2322

2003). studies on the involvement of serotonin in reinforced
behavior in sert-deficient mice are also mainly limited to
the context of drug use. cocaine-induced place preference is
maintained in sert-deficient mice (sora et al, 1998). these
mice are also anxious, hypoactive and less aggressive
(holmes et al, 2002a, b, 2003a, b, c; ansorge et al, 2004).
however, little is known about the effects of sert deletion
on responses for natural reward.
we report here the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment
and genetic deletion of the sert on food-reinforced
behavior in three paradigms: first, the progressive ratio
operant task (pr), which tests the amount of work an
animal is willing to perform for food reward (hodos, 1961);
second, the concurrent food choice operant task, which
allows a more careful analysis of effort expended to obtain a
preferred reward (cousins and salamone, 1994); and third,
the pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task (pit), which
examines the ability of pavlovian conditioned cues that
predict reward to enhance operant responding (wyvell and
berridge, 2000). our results indicate that both fluoxetine
treatment and sert gene deletion reduce operant responding for natural reward as well as a generalized reduction in
motor output.

materials and methods
animals
all animals were group-housed (4–5 /cage) in a temperature- and humidity-controlled (251c) barrier facility, with
lights on/off at 0600/1800 h. all testing was conducted
during the light phase with the exception of wheel running
activity which is tested continuously for 2 weeks. all animal
procedures were approved by the institutional animal care
and use committee at the university of chicago.
sert null mice were generated by insertion of the cre
recombinase cdna and polya into the 50 -utr of sert
genomic dna. the generation and use of this line as a
tissue-specific cre recombinase expression line was described elsewhere (zhuang et al, 2005). insertion of cre
resulted in the complete absence of sert mrna and
protein, which was confirmed by in situ hybridization
and ligand binding autoradiography respectively (not
shown). these mice were originally generated on a 129svj
background, and were subsequently crossed to c57bl6/j
for four generations. all sert null and wild-type (wt)
mice were generated by breeding heterozygotes, thus
permitting the use of littermate controls. the same group
of sert null and wt (n ¼ 12 per genotype, equal number
of males and females) mice were used for progressive ratio
and for the concurrent choice task. a different group
(n ¼ 12 per genotype, equal number of males and females)
was used for the pavlovian to instrumental transfer
task (pit).
the fluoxetine experiments utilized all male c57bl/6j
mice (ordered from the jackson laboratory). a first group
of mice (n ¼ 12 per treatment) was used for the progressive
ratio sated condition. a second independent group (n ¼ 12
per treatment) was used for the progressive ratio fooddeprived condition. a third independent group (n ¼ 12 per
treatment) was used for pit and subsequently for the
concurrent choice task.

the above animal numbers reflect the total number of
animals with which we began the experiment; due to deaths
during the lengthy experiment or failure to learn operant
tasks, the actual numbers as reflected in figure legends may
be slightly different.

drugs
fluoxetine hydrochloride (generously provided by nimh)
was dissolved in dh2o and administered at a dose of 10 mg/
kg, in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. ip injections of
either fluoxetine or 0.9% saline were given after the daily
behavioral sessions, to ensure that chronic rather than acute
drug effects were examined, with the exception of the first
dose, which was administered before the daily behavioral
session.
progressive ratio data collection started at the beginning
of fluoxetine treatment and lasted for 3 weeks. as the same
treatment effect was seen throughout the 3 weeks, all 3
weeks were used in data analysis. for pit, mice had been
treated with daily fluoxetine for 2 weeks before pavlovian
training, which continued throughout the experiment. for
the concurrent choice task, which was conducted after pit
in the same group of animals, mice had been treated with
fluoxetine for 8 weeks before the experiment, which
continued throughout the experiment. body weights were
taken during the progressive ratio sated condition after 3
weeks of fluoxetine treatment. open-field locomotor activity
was measured after completion of progressive ratio experiments (after 3–4 weeks of fluoxetine treatment, as indicated
below).

progressive ratio operant task
the progressive ratio (pr) operant task was conducted in
six mouse operant conditioning chambers with two
retractable levers on either side of the feeder, a house light,
two signal lights above the levers, and a feeder with
photobeam (med associates, st albans, vt). all mice were
maintained at 85–90% of their free-feeding body weight
except during the food-sated testing condition. mice were
given five 45-min sessions per week, and were trained as
follows: 2 days of magazine training in which one pellet was
delivered with a variable interval of 30 s that was
independent of the animal’s responses, followed by fixedratio 1 (fr1) sessions until animals reached criteria of 30
or more lever presses over 2 consecutive days. when all
animals acquired lever pressing on an fr1 schedule,
which took varying lengths of time, a final fr1 session
was given to all animals, and progressive ratio testing
commenced. an inactive lever was used to control for nonspecific activity. food-sated animals were run on a pr3
schedule (increment by three lever presses after each
reward); food-deprived, a pr5 schedule (increment by five
lever presses after each reward). breakpoint was defined
either as the last ratio completed in the 45-min session, or
the last ratio completed before the animal stopped lever
pressing for 5 min (which terminated the session). the two
fluoxetine progressive ratio experiments (food-sated and
food-deprived) therefore each involved two phases: 3 weeks
of baseline progressive ratio sessions, followed by 3 weeks

ac sanders et al

of treated progressive ratio sessions in either food-deprived
or food-sated conditions.

pavlovian to instrumental transfer
these sessions were adapted from the protocol published by
wyvell and berridge (2000). animals were maintained at
85–90% of their free-feeding body weight. animals were
trained with 30-min sessions of variable interval (vi)
schedules, which were increased from vi 10 s (vi10) to
vi30. once the vi30 schedule was reached, baseline
measurements were taken for 2 weeks. two control sessions
were then given before commencement of pavlovian
training sessions. the control sessions consisted of the
normal vi30 session run in the dark, with a light randomly
activated for 30 s, five times during the session. control
sessions were to examine the possibility that any observed
response rate changes during light presentation was to a
non-specific effect of light. mice were then given 10
pavlovian conditioning sessions, with no levers present.
the pavlovian cue was identical to the cue used during the
control sessions and was presented 10 times randomly
distributed in the 30-min session. the cue concluded with
delivery of a food pellet. following the 10 pavlovian sessions
(a total of 100 light-food parings), animals were given two
normal vi30 sessions to restore lever-pressing behavior.
four test sessions were then conducted under extinction
conditions. test sessions contained five 30 s periods of
illumination of the pavlovian light cue which were
randomly distributed in the 30 min session. analysis
consisted of comparison of the press rate during the
2.5 min before the light was illuminated (baseline) relative
to the press rate during the 2.5 min of illumination. data
are presented as enhancement ratio: ‘presses during light/
(presses during baseline + presses during light).’ an enhancement ratio greater than 0.5 indicates lever pressing is
enhanced by the cue.

the concurrent food choice operant task
this behavioral paradigm was adapted from cousins and
salamone, (1994). the concurrent choice task was carried
out following the pit sessions (see above). animals were
trained to lever press as discussed above under pit, and
maintained at 85–90% of their free-feeding body weight.
the task consisted of five 30-min fr 20 (for the fluoxetine
vs saline experiment) or fr 30 (for the sert null vs wt
mice experiment) sessions. during 3 of these sessions (on
alternate days), regular rodent chow was available in the
operant chambers along with the operant levers (‘choice’
condition). the other 2 days were the ‘no choice’ condition,
in which rodent chow was not available, and food could be
obtained only by lever pressing.

open field locomotor activity
each mouse was placed in an acrylic open field chamber
40 cm long  40 cm wide  37 cm high (med associates,
st albans, vt). no background noise was provided and
illumination was set to 20–25 lux. infrared beams recorded
the animal’s location and path (locomotor activity).
animals were placed in the lower right-hand corner of the

open field and their activity was measured for 30 min. data
are presented as total distance traveled during the entire
session. the chambers were cleaned with 90% etoh
between all sessions.

home cage wheel running activity
mice were singly housed each with a 4.5-inch wire mesh
wheel (pets international, ltd). two counterbalanced
magnets (digi-key) were attached to the wheel. the wheel
was situated in the cage such that a magnetic switch closes
(digi-key) at every pass of a magnet. data were collected
using vitalview acquisition software, qa-4 activity input
modules and dp-24 data ports (mini-mitter). data were
collected every 5 min for 2 weeks. the total number of bouts
in 2 weeks, the average revolutions per bout, and the
average wheel running speed were recorded. a bout was
defined as consecutive minutes where the mouse turned the
wheel minimally 2.5 complete revolutions.

data analysis
data were analyzed using statview 5.0.1. independent twotailed student t-test was used when genotype or treatment
was the only grouping variable. anova was used when
additional factors were considered. repeated measures
anova was used when data were collected in multiple
trials.

results
blockade or deletion of sert reduced operant
responding for food reward
we measured the break point in the progressive ratio
operant task, which is considered to be an index of how
hard the animal is willing to work for rewards (hodos,
1961). overall, sert null mice had lower break points,
indicating a reduced motivation to work for reward. this
was true for both food-deprived (genotype effect in repeated
measures anova, figure 1a, f(1,21) ¼ 4.5, po0.05) and
food-sated conditions (figure 1b, f(1,20) ¼ 5.8, po0.05).
similarly, fluoxetine treatment caused a significant
decrease in break point in the progressive ratio operant
task, which was present regardless of feeding state
(treatment effect in repeated measures anova, figure 1c,
f(1,21) ¼ 4.9, po0.05 for food-deprived and figure 1d,
f(1,22) ¼ 6.4, po0.05 for food-sated conditions).
to examine food-motivated behavior in more detail, we
subjected food-deprived animals to the concurrent food
choice operant task, in which animals could lever-press for
a preferred reward, or eat standard rodent chow that was
freely available in the operant chamber. sert null mice
displayed significantly lower operant responding during ‘no
choice’ days (genotype effect in repeated measures anova,
figure 2b, f(1,20) ¼ 4.4, po0.05) as well as a trend toward
lower responding on ‘choice’ days (figure 2a, f(1,20) ¼ 4.0,
p ¼ 0.059). there was a trend toward a reduction in the
percentage of food obtained from lever pressing in sert
null mice (genotype effect in repeated measures anova,
figure 2c, f(1,20) ¼ 4.1, p ¼ 0.056). however, total food
consumption was not significantly different between the two

in repeated measures anova, figure 2e, f(1,20) ¼ 1.8,
p40.1).
fluoxetine treatment did not significantly alter any of the
parameters measured in the concurrent choice task (treatment effect in repeated measures anova, figure 2e, f, g
and h, p40.1 for all). although there was a trend toward
a reduction in total food consumed (treatment effect in
repeated measures anova, figure 2h, f(1,21) ¼ 4.0,
p ¼ 0.06), there was no difference in chow consumption
during choice condition (treatment effect in repeated
measures anova, figure 2j, f(1,21) ¼ 2.8, p40.1).
in addition to unaffected food consumption in the above
experiments, we did not observe changes in body weight in
sert null mice (genotype effect in two-way anova,
figure 3a, f(1,18) ¼ 0.74, p40.3) or after chronic fluoxetine
treatment (treatment effect in unpaired t-test, figure 3b,
t(22) ¼ 1.3, p40.2), further reinforcing the conclusion that
reduced operant responding for food reward was not due to
appetite suppression in the sert null or fluoxetine-treated
mice.

showed a trend toward reduced inactive lever responses
when food-deprived (treatment effect in repeated measures
anova, figure 5c, f(1,21) ¼ 2.8, p ¼ 0.11).
we further investigated the possibility of activity reduction in sert-null and fluoxetine-treated mice by using lowlit (25 lux) open field locomotor activity boxes. sert null
mice displayed significantly reduced locomotor activity in
both food-deprived (genotype effect in unpaired t-tests
figure 6a, t(21) ¼ 3.7, po0.01) and food-sated (figure 6b,
t(21) ¼ 4.5, po0.001) conditions. similarly, fluoxetine
treatment for 3 weeks’ significantly reduced open-field
activity as compared to the saline treatment group
(treatment effect in unpaired t-test, figure 6c, t(22) ¼ 3.6,
po0.01 for the food-deprived condition and figure 6d,
t(22) ¼ 3.5, po0.01 for the food-sated condition).
as locomotor activities in the open field often reflect an
animal’s reactivity to the novel environment, we examined
home cage wheel running activities of sert null and
wt control mice continuously for 2 weeks. there is no
significant difference between genotypes in total number of
bouts (genotype effect in anova, figure 7a, f(1,12) ¼ 1.4,
p40.2), average revolutions per bout (genotype effect in
anova, figure 7b, f(1,12) ¼ 1.4, p40.2) or average wheel
running speed (genotype effect in anova, figure 7c,
f(1,12) ¼ 0.67, p40.4).
to examine further whether a motor impairment might
contribute to the behavioral phenotypes of sert null and
fluoxetine-treated mice, we analyzed the proportion of
progressive ratio responses that had very short interresponse times (irts). this analysis did not reveal any

differences between sert null and wt control mice in the
ratio of responses with irts between 0 and 1 s to total
responses (genotype effect in unpaired t-test, figure 8a,
t(20) ¼ 1.3, p40.2 for food deprived and figure 8b,
t(20) ¼ 0.90, p40.3 for food sated conditions). similarly,
fluoxetine-treatment was not associated with any differences in this parameter (treatment effect in unpaired t-test,
figure 8c, t(21) ¼ 1.7, p40.1 for food-deprived and
figure 8d, t(22) ¼ 0.72, p40.4 for food sated conditions).

discussion
in the present study, we consistently find that chronic
pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of sert
result in similar behavioral consequences: either manipulation reduces operant responding for natural reward.
reduced operant responding for food reward in mice
treated chronically with fluoxetine and in sert null mice is
in line with previous studies reporting declines in respond-

ing for drug, alcohol, and intracranial self-stimulation with
fluoxetine treatment (carroll et al, 1990; hubbell et al, 1991;
richardson and roberts, 1991; lee and kornetsky, 1998;
wilson et al, 2000; baker et al, 2001; glatz et al, 2002),
suggesting that although previous studies examined nonnatural rewards, the effect of fluoxetine can be generalized
to different reward types.
the reduction in operant responding after chronic
pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of sert is
not specific for goal-directed responses. to gain additional
insight into changes seen with sert blockade or deletion,
it is most relevant to compare these data with the
consequences of dopaminergic manipulations. the effects
of such manipulations on motivated behaviors have been
well characterized. blockade of dopaminergic receptors
leads to reduced operant responding for natural reward.

neuropsychopharmacology

5-ht reduces operant responding for reward
ac sanders et al

2327

however, such reduction is more specific for goal-directed
behavior. in the progressive ratio task utilizing natural
reward, dopamine antagonists only reduce operant responding on the active lever, not the inactive one, and only
when animals are food deprived (aberman et al, 1998;
hamill et al, 1999). in the concurrent food choice task, a
similar reduction in responding is only seen in the ‘choice’
condition, not the ‘no choice’ condition (cousins and
salamone, 1994; cousins et al, 1994, 1996; salamone et al,
1995, 2001, 2002; sokolowski and salamone, 1998; aberman
and salamone, 1999; nowend et al, 2001; correa et al, 2002;
ishiwari et al, 2004; mingote et al, 2005), suggesting that the
role of dopamine becomes important when the task requires
the ability to increase effort. similarly, previous work in our
laboratory utilizing genetic repression of  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) expression (which elevates extracellular
dopamine levels) has demonstrated increased operant
responding for food reward in the progressive ratio task
only on the active lever and only when food-deprived
(cagniard et al, 2006). moreover, increased operant
responding for food reward in these mice is seen in the
concurrent food choice task only in the ‘choice’ condition,
not in the ‘no choice’ condition (cagniard et al, 2006). in
direct contrast, chronic pharmacological blockade or
genetic deletion of the sert reduces operant responding
on active as well as inactive levers, it is seen in both fooddeprived and food-sated conditions, and it affects operant
responding in both ‘choice’ and ‘no choice’ conditions.
moreover, we specifically examined the incentive motivational effect of the pavlovian conditioned cue to increase
operant responding in pit. it has been reported that
nucleus accumbens infusion of amphetamine enhances the
incentive motivational effect of the pavlovian conditioned
cue, presumably owing to increases in dopaminergic
activity (wyvell and berridge, 2000). in contrast, we found
that sert blockade or deletion had no effect in the pit task,
suggesting, first that our sert manipulation does not affect
animals’ ability to learn the pavlovian association, and
second, that this manipulation does not specifically affect
the incentive motivational properties of the light cue.
a number of empirical studies and computational models
have suggested that serotonin and dopamine have opposing
functions in motivational processes (cameron and williams, 1995; luciana et al, 1998; gainetdinov et al, 1999;
daw et al, 2002). even though elevated serotonergic activity
appears to reduce operant responding as elevated dopaminergic activity appears to enhance operant responding for
natural rewards, our careful experimental design and data
analyses suggest that the motivational opponency view of
dopamine and serotonin function is oversimplified. dopamine and serotonin obviously affect different behavioral
processes that modulate motivation in different ways. it is
also worth pointing out that in certain paradigms, such as
cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, dopamine and serotonin
may even act synergistically (bubar et al, 2003).
it has been suggested that sert deletion may result in
motor impairment (holmes et al, 2002b). our data suggest
that sert null mice have a generalized reduction in motor
output or a reduction in response vigor in a novel or
challenging environment. in both the open field (a novel
environment) and the operant box (in which lever presses
may yield potential food reward), sert null mice have

significantly lower responses than the wt control mice.
however, in home cage environment, they do not have
lower wheel running activities than their wt controls. the
lower operant responses of sert null mice are not owing to
reduced fast responses. in the progressive ratio operant
task, the proportion of progressive ratio responses that have
very short inter-response times did not differ between sert
null and wt control mice.
another potential confound that could complicate interpretation of our data is appetite. reduced appetite could
potentially explain reduced operant responding for food
reward in sert null and in fluoxetine treated mice.
fluoxetine, like the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, is an
appetite suppressant and can cause clinically significant
weight loss in humans, although it is not currently used
clinically as a weight-loss agent (halford et al, 2005;
ioannides-demos et al, 2005). however, in the concurrent
choice operant task, neither the total food intake nor the
rodent chow intake was significantly affected by sert
deletion or blockade. this contrasts with published studies
using the same paradigm and showed the effect of
fenfluramine in reducing both lever pressing and chow
consumption (salamone et al, 2002). moreover, body weight
was not affected by either manipulation in our study.
therefore, appetite is unlikely to contribute significantly to
the reductions in operant responding we observed.
the present study details for the first time the effects of
both chronic ssri treatment and constitutive sert deletion
on food-reinforced behavior. the fact that pharmacological
blockade and genetic deletion of sert result in similar
changes in almost all the parameters that we examined in
different behavioral tasks reinforces the utility of the sert
null line for investigation of the mechanisms underlying
chronic ssri treatment, despite the complete loss of sert
activity throughout development and adulthood in sert
null mice. the present study also highlights the importance
of understanding the interactions between the serotonin
and dopamine systems in both the study of depression and
the mechanisms that mediate the therapeutic effects of
antidepressants.
