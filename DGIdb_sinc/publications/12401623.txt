complex regional pain syndrome is often treated with
the sympatholytic  xxxd2243xxx  and a local anesthetic
in a bier’s block. the efficacy of this treatment has been
questioned. because local anesthetics inhibit the norepinephrine uptake transporter, we hypothesized that
this variable efficacy results from the local inhibiting
the uptake of  xxxd2243xxx . in this study, we tested this
hypothesis by using a sympathetically innervated
mouse vas deferens preparation. organ bath-mounted
mouse vasa deferentia were electrically stimulated in
the absence and presence of  xxxd2243xxx , prilocaine,
procaine, and cocaine in various combinations. prilocaine (1 mm) induced an immediate inhibition of twitch
response (maximum 100% after 2 min) that fully reversed after washing.  xxxd2243xxx  (3 ␮m) also inhibited twitching by 95% ⫾ 3% in 15 min, but this effect was
only partially reversed after 1 h of washing (33% ⫾ 12%
of control). when prilocaine and  xxxd2243xxx  were

omplex regional pain syndrome is a chronic
pain syndrome characterized by dysfunctional
sympathetic activity (1). current treatment regimens for this condition include surgical or pharmacological sympathectomy (2–5). pharmacological sympathectomy involves blocking the corresponding
sympathetic nerves with specific drugs or regional
anesthesia techniques. iv regional  xxxd2243xxx  bier’s
block (ivrgbb), which was first described in 1974 (2),
is used often.  xxxd2243xxx  is a substrate for the norepinephrine (ne) transporter (net), affording specificity for sympathetic nerves. once taken up by the
net,  xxxd2243xxx  displaces ne from the cell’s releasable stores, providing a chemical sympathectomy (6).

added in combination, a reversal of 80% ⫾ 13% (at 1 h)
was observed. procaine (300 ␮m) produced a transient
increase (152% ⫾ 14%) in response. when co-incubated
with  xxxd2243xxx  (3 ␮m), the twitch was reduced to
24% ⫾ 4% of control and was reversed to 77% ⫾ 7%
after 1 h. cocaine (30 ␮m) inhibited the twitch response
to 53% ⫾ 8%, which was fully reversed by 1 h of washing. when co-incubated with  xxxd2243xxx , the response was reduced to 39% ⫾ 6% of control and was
reversed to 86% ⫾ 10% after 1 h. in all cases, the reversal
produced by the combination was significantly more
intense (p ⬍ 0.05) than that produced by  xxxd2243xxx 
alone. local anesthetics reduce the sympatholytic actions of  xxxd2243xxx , and this may explain the variable
efficacy of  xxxd2243xxx  in the treatment of complex
regional pain syndrome.

 xxxd2243xxx  and a local anesthetic, such as prilocaine, are injected iv; the local anesthetic provides
relief from the discomfort produced by  xxxd2243xxx .
the inclusion of a local anesthetic also allows manipulation of the affected extremity beyond the range
normally tolerated by the patient (7).
the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome
with ivrgbb has been reported to have variable efficacy (8). because the local anesthetic, cocaine, competitively inhibits the uptake of ne (9), we hypothesized
that other local anesthetics may interact with the net
to modify uptake. indeed, we have previously demonstrated significant inhibition of uptake with clinical
concentrations of a range of local anesthetics, including prilocaine (10,11).1 we suggest that the variable
efficacy of ivrgbb results from the local anesthetic

reducing the uptake of  xxxd2243xxx , resulting in a
partial, short-lived sympathectomy.
the primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that local anesthetics impair the uptake of
 xxxd2243xxx  in the mouse vas deferens (mvd), a
sympathetically innervated ex vivo preparation. specifically, our goals were the following.
1. to examine the effects of  xxxd2243xxx  (a sympathomimetic) and local anesthetics alone.
2. to determine whether local anesthetics (amide; prilocaine, ester; procaine; and the known net inhibitor, cocaine) modify the actions of  xxxd2243xxx .

methods
this study was approved by the animal use committee
of the university of ferrara, ferrara, italy. vasa deferentia were taken from male swiss mice (25–30 g),
according to calo’ et al. (12). the tissues were suspended in 5-ml organ baths containing krebs solution
(mg2⫹ free; 2.5 mm cacl2; ph 7.4) bubbled with 95%
oxygen and 5% co2 at 33°c, and a resting tension of
0.3 g was applied.
the mvds were continuously stimulated by two
electrodes with supramaximal voltage (30-v) rectangular pulses of 1-ms duration and 0.05-hz frequency.
electrically evoked contractions were measured isotonically with a strain gauge transducer (basile 7006;
comerio va, italy), and responses were recorded with
a basile recorder (model gemini 7070; comerio va).
after an equilibration period of ⬃60 min, the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (efs) were
stable. in the initial series of experiments, tetrodotoxin
(0.3 ␮m) and  xxxd3000xxx  (1 ␮m) were added to the baths
to confirm the neurogenic nature of the contraction
and the involvement of ␣1 adrenoceptors. prilocaine 1
mm, procaine 300 ␮m, and cocaine 30 ␮m (estimated
from binding studies) (11) were added for 15 min and
then washed at 15-min intervals for up to 75 min to
determine any direct effects and reversibility. in other
experiments,  xxxd2243xxx  (3 and 10 ␮m) was added
for 15 min and then washed at 15-min intervals for up
to 75 min. this extensive washing procedure was used
to ensure removal of local anesthetic and  xxxd2243xxx . finally, local anesthetic and  xxxd2243xxx  combinations (prilocaine 1 mm plus  xxxd2243xxx  3 and 10
␮m; procaine 300 ␮m plus  xxxd2243xxx  3 ␮m; and
cocaine 30 ␮m plus  xxxd2243xxx  3 ␮m) were tested in
the same manner. a time control (no added drug) was
also included in each experiment.
data are presented as the mean percentage of control (baseline) efs-induced twitch (⫾sem) values for n
individual experiments, as described in the figure legends. statistical comparisons were made by student’s
t-test and analysis of variance, as appropriate, and
differences were considered significant when p ⬍ 0.05

results
efs elicited a twitch response that returned to baseline
in ⬍2 s. after a period of washing and stabilizing
(approximately 60 min), a twitch response relatively
constant in amplitude was achieved. this control
(baseline) state continued for ⬎75 min. efs contraction with the variables used (30 v, 1 ms, 0.05 hz) was
clearly neurogenic and mediated by ␣1 adrenoceptors,
because the contraction was fully blocked by tetrodotoxin (0.3 ␮m) and partially reversed by  xxxd3000xxx  (1
␮m) (fig. 1).
prilocaine at 1 mm induced an immediate inhibition
of twitch response that reached a maximum (100%)
after 2 min. this inhibitory effect was rapidly reversible after washing.  xxxd2243xxx  (3 ␮m) also inhibited
baseline efs twitch by 95% ⫾ 3% in 15 min (fig. 2).
however, in contrast to prilocaine, this effect was only
partially reversed after 1 h of washing (33% ⫾ 12% of
control values). when prilocaine and  xxxd2243xxx 
were added in combination at 1 mm and 3 ␮m, respectively (fig. 2), a reversal of 80% ⫾ 13% was observed after 1 h, which was significantly greater (p ⬍
0.05) than the reversal produced by  xxxd2243xxx  (3
␮m) alone. these reversal data are summarized in
figure 3.
increasing the  xxxd2243xxx  concentration to 10 ␮m
inhibited the efs twitch response to 4% ⫾ 3% of
control, and it was reversed to 8% ⫾ 3% after 1 h of
washing. when prilocaine (1 mm) was co-incubated
with  xxxd2243xxx  (10 ␮m), the efs twitch was inhibited to 2% ⫾ 2% of control but reversed to 30% ⫾ 10%
after 1 h of washing (fig. 4). the reversal produced by
the combination was significantly greater (p ⬍ 0.05)
than that produced by  xxxd2243xxx  alone and is suggestive of a competitive interaction between  xxxd2243xxx  and prilocaine.
procaine (300 ␮m) alone facilitated the twitch response to 152% ⫾ 14% of control but returned to
control levels 10 min after the first wash, from which
point the trace remained stable. when co-incubated
with  xxxd2243xxx  (3 ␮m), the efs twitch was reduced
to 24% ⫾ 4% of control and reversed to 77% ⫾ 7% of
control after 1 h of washing. the reversal produced by
the combination was significantly greater (p ⬍ 0.05)
than that produced by  xxxd2243xxx  alone (fig. 5).
reversal data are summarized in figure 3.
cocaine (30 ␮m) inhibited the efs twitch response
to 53% ⫾ 8% of control and was completely reversed
by 1 h of washing. when co-incubated with  xxxd2243xxx  (3 ␮m), the efs twitch was reduced to 39% ⫾ 6%
of control and was reversed to 86% ⫾ 10% after 1 h of
washing. the reversal produced by the combination
was significantly greater (p ⬍ 0.05) than that produced
by  xxxd2243xxx  alone (fig. 6). reversal data are summarized in figure 3.

discussion
we have clearly demonstrated that prilocaine and cocaine inhibit efs twitches of the mvd in a reversible
manner. in contrast, procaine produced a small, transient enhancement of twitches.  xxxd2243xxx , as expected, also reduced this response, confirming its
sympatholytic effect. however, the most important
finding of this study was that, when co-administered
(as would occur in ivrgbb), the local anesthetic reduced the effect of  xxxd2243xxx  and that this could be
partially overcome by increasing the concentration of
 xxxd2243xxx .
these data confirm and extend our previous study
in sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells as a model of
human sympathetic neurons in vitro (11). in this study,
we demonstrated that a range of local anesthetics (including prilocaine, procaine, and cocaine) and unlabeled  xxxd2243xxx  (unpublished data) inhibited the
uptake of [3h]ne, which we used as a surrogate for

[3h] xxxd2243xxx  (which is commercially unavailable), in a concentration-dependent manner. in addition, these same local anesthetics and unlabeled
 xxxd2243xxx  (unpublished data) also inhibited the
binding of the selective net radiolabel [3h]nisoxetine
(13,14). there was a positive correlation between the
inhibition of uptake and binding (r2 ⫽ 0.68; p ⬍ 0.05).
moreover, we have similar data in hek293 cells expressing the recombinant human net (10) (unpublished data).1 these data suggest that local anesthetics
may inhibit the uptake of  xxxd2243xxx  and form the
rationale for performing the present investigation in
the mvd. in our previous studies, there was a competitive inhibition of [3h]ne uptake and displacement
of [3h]nisoxetine binding that we wished to probe
further ex vivo.

combination after one hour of washing was 80% (compared with 33% for  xxxd2243xxx  alone). however,
when the  xxxd2243xxx  concentration in the bath was
increased to 10 ␮m, the reversal was reduced to 30%
(compared with 8% for  xxxd2243xxx  alone). these
data are suggestive of a competitive interaction in that
the reduction of the sympatholytic activity of  xxxd2243xxx  produced by prilocaine could be overcome by
increasing the  xxxd2243xxx  (net substrate) concentration. competitivity for procaine and cocaine were
not formally examined in this investigation, but we
have no reason to suspect any other mode of interaction. despite a presumed competitive interaction, increasing the  xxxd2243xxx  dose in humans would be
unwise because of its poor side-effect profile.

while the amide prilocaine is the most commonly
used local anesthetic in ivrgbb (8), we wanted to test
a representative ester-type local anesthetic (procaine)
and a known inhibitor of net (cocaine). the inhibition of net activity by cocaine is used in nasal surgery
to produce vasoconstriction and hence reduce bleeding (15). the observation that procaine and cocaine
inhibited the actions of  xxxd2243xxx  adds weight to
our working hypothesis that local anesthetics inhibit
the uptake of  xxxd2243xxx .
the degree of twitch depression produced by 30 ␮m
cocaine alone was only ⬃50%, which is in marked
contrast to the inhibition produced by prilocaine
(⬎70%). it is unlikely that the initial reduction in contraction in response to local anesthetic application is
due to net inhibition. it is more likely that this results
from interference with neuronal voltage-sensitive
channels (e.g., na⫹), and cocaine at 30 ␮m may produce a partial inhibition of na⫹ channels. this local
anesthetic produced a smaller twitch inhibition than
prilocaine, but as we have previously demonstrated, it
produces a full inhibition of net activity (11).1
it is worthy of mention that procaine produced a
small, transient increase in twitch amplitude. the
mechanism for this increase in unclear. it is possible
that the increase in twitch amplitude may be due to
inhibition of guanosine triphosphatase activity within
the postsynaptic cell. hageluken et al. (16) reported
that procaine, at the concentration used here, inhibited
 xxxd2247xxx  (gtp) hydrolysis in cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  -differentiated hl-60 cells.
this could potentiate the effects of gq type g proteincoupled receptors, such as ␣1 adrenoceptors, by reducing gtp hydrolysis. interestingly, in this study, tetracaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine were reported to
increase gtp hydrolysis (16).
in summary, we have clearly demonstrated that
local anesthetics inhibit the uptake of  xxxd2243xxx 
and suggest that their coadministration in ivrgbb
might explain the inconsistent clinical reports with
respect to efficacy. clinical studies are required to
compare the ivrgbb in the absence and presence of
local anesthetic, or traditional ivrgbb could be compared with  xxxd2243xxx  in sedated or anesthetized
patients.
