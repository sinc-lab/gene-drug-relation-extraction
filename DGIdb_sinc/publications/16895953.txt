context: small body size at birth is associated with cardiovascular
disease and type 2 diabetes in adult life. this link may be in part
mediated by early-life programming of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (hpaa) function.
objective: our objective was to assess whether haplotypes of the
 xxxg1601xxx  (gr) gene modify this link.
design and participants: we conducted a birth cohort study that
included 437 men and women born in helsinki, finland, during 1924 –
1933, whose birth measurements were recorded.
main outcome measures: we studied how the oral glucose tolerance test and fasting plasma total and free cortisol concentrations
and, in a subset of 162 women, a more detailed hpaa evaluation, are
predicted by body size at birth and haplotypes of the gr locus. we also
measured the haplotype-specific relative mrna expression level for
the haplotype of interest.

s

mall body size at birth is associated with a number
of adverse late-life health outcomes including higher
rates of cardiovascular disease (1, 2) and type 2 diabetes (3,
4). evidence from animal experiments (5, 6) and epidemiological studies (7, 8) has suggested that lifelong programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpaa) by
intrauterine glucocorticoid excess is likely to play a key role
in mediating this association. however, the relationship of
body size and gestational age at birth, commonly used markers of fetal environment in epidemiological studies, with
indicators of adult hpaa function has not been consistent in
all birth cohort studies (9 –12). moreover, animal studies
suggest that the late-life consequences depend largely on the

results: one of the haplotypes was associated with lower birth
weight and length and higher fasting plasma and mean 24-h salivary
cortisol. moreover, this haplotype modified the association of length
at birth with adult phenotypes; in carriers, short length at birth was
associated with increased fasting plasma cortisol, cortisol/corticosteroid-binding globulin ratio, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes [1
cm decrease corresponded to 1.36-fold odds ratio; 95% confidence
interval (ci), 1.09 –1.70; p ⫽ 0.007], and higher 120-min glucose
(5.8%; 95% ci, 2.5–9.1%; p ⫽ 0.0007), but no association was seen in
noncarriers (p for interaction was 0.06, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.01, respectively). the mrna expression level of this haplotype was 93.7% (95%
ci, 90.5–96.8%; p ⫽ 2.2 ⫻ 10⫺4) of the expression level of the other
haplotypes.
conclusions: a common gr haplotype may contribute to and modify
the association of short length at birth with adult glucose tolerance
and hpaa function by a mechanism that affects regulation of gr
expression. (j clin endocrinol metab 91: 4544 – 4551, 2006)

timing and nature of the stimulus and the species involved
(13). because of the significant heritability of type 2 diabetesrelated traits (14) as well as fetal growth (15), it would be
valuable to incorporate both the genetic factors and these
recognized markers of fetal environment in the studies of
glucose regulation; this has so far been largely neglected.
glucocorticoids that are produced in response to signals
from the hpaa have an important role in the regulation of
glucose metabolism and fetal development. glucocorticoids,
including cortisol, mediate their cellular action by complexing with the cytoplasmic  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), which
then translocates to the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor. therefore, gr is an attractive candidate gene to
be involved in the link between hpaa function and early-life
conditions resulting in later-life metabolic diseases.
response to glucocorticoids varies greatly between individuals, which has in part been attributed to variation in the
gr gene, although the exact causative polymorphisms have
not been confirmed. such polymorphisms could influence
the amount of intrauterine glucocorticoid exposure on fetal
growth and, perhaps, glucocorticoid metabolism later in life.

rautanen et al. • gr gene, birth size, and glucose tolerance

the following three polymorphisms in the gr gene locus
have been studied extensively: bcli restriction site and n363s
polymorphisms have been associated with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity (16, 17) and consequently with unfavorable cardiovascular and metabolic profiles, whereas the
er22/23ek seems to show the opposite associations, including lower fasting insulin and serum total and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in elderly subjects (18)
and even lower all-cause mortality (19). the n363s variant
has been associated with increased salivary cortisol responses to psychosocial stress (20) and in several studies with
obesity (16, 21, 22), although these associations have been
questioned by a number of negative reports (23–25). similarly, the bcli polymorphism has been associated with abdominal obesity, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher
cortisol levels (26), but also negative studies have been published (27, 28). bcli has also been associated with a lower
cortisol response to psychosocial stress (20). thus far, none
of these polymorphisms has been associated with type 2
diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (21, 22).
we are unaware of any earlier studies incorporating earlylife factors in assessing the effects of genetic variations in the
gr gene. we have examined within the helsinki birth cohort, with detailed birth measurements available, whether
the relationship of size at birth with adult hpaa function
and glucose tolerance is dependent on different haplotypes
of the gr gene. we focused on the haplotype structure,
instead of individual rare polymorphisms, to consider major
common variation within the gr gene locus.
subjects and methods
the helsinki birth cohort study includes 7086 men and women who
were born as singletons at helsinki university central hospital during
1924 –1933. from this cohort, a total of 473 randomly selected subjects
whose birth records included dates of birth and last menstrual period
and weight and length at birth attended a clinical study, including
anthropometry, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (4), measurement of
serum cortisol and corticosteroid-binding globulin (cbg) concentrations (9), and a blood sample for dna extraction. free cortisol index
(fci) was calculated by the following formula: fci ⫽ [cortisol (␮mol/
liter)/cbg (mg/ml) ⫻ 100]. there were 16 sibling pairs within the study
sample. to ensure that possible associations were attributable to the gr
gene locus, one randomly chosen subject from each sibling pair was
excluded. of these 457 individuals, we were able to assess the gr
haplotype for 437 subjects (163 men and 274 women). of these subjects,
93 (21%) had type 2 diabetes and 123 (28%) impaired glucose tolerance
according to the criteria recommended by the world health organization (29), american diabetes association (30), and international diabetes
federation (global guideline for type 2 diabetes, available at www.
idf.org). the prevalence is similar to that previously described in elderly
finnish people (31). the 24 subjects receiving medication for diabetes
were included in the study but excluded from the analyses of glucose
and insulin concentrations because these may be affected by the
medication.
of these 437 subjects, 162 women had in addition taken part in a more
detailed evaluation of hpaa function consisting of an overnight
0.25-mg dexamethasone test followed by a low-dose (1 ␮g) acth1–24
test (10) and a 24-h collection of salivary cortisol samples in their normal
daily environment at awakening, 15 and 30 min thereafter, and at 1200,
1700, and 2200 h and the following morning (11). this relatively laborintensive protocol allowed us to assess the association of the gr genotype with hpaa function in more detail, although the sample size was
not sufficient for a meaningful analysis of interactive effects with size at
birth. compared with the rest of the women, those who took part in the
more detailed hpaa examination had similar size and gestational age

at birth (all p ⬎ 0.3) and similar height, body mass index (bmi), fasting
cortisol, and cbg concentrations at examination, although they were
slightly younger at the time of the baseline examination (69.3 vs. 70.0 yr,
p ⫽ 0.05).

genotyping
fifteen single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) markers, located in
the gr gene locus on chromosome 5q31, were selected from the public
ensembl human genome browser database (http://www.ensembl.org/
homo sapiens/). the selected snps were evaluated by genotyping 91
individuals with a single-nucleotide primer extension (snupe)-based
method. uninformative markers (minor allele frequency ⬍ 0.05) were
discarded and the rest of the samples were genotyped with six polymorphic snps. pcr assays were performed as described (32), followed
by the allelic discrimination reactions by using the megabace snupe
genotyping kit (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj) as described
(33). all primers were designed by using the primer3 program (http://
www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) and are
available upon request. genotypes followed hardy-weinberg
equilibrium.

haplotype construction
snp rs6188 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs258813
and was therefore excluded. haplotypes were inferred with snphap
software (http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/snphap.
txt/) by using the genotypes of the following five snps: rs6196, rs258813,
rs4986593, rs852984, and rs6195 (fig. 1). haplotypes with confidence
values over 0.9 were accepted in the association analysis.

data analysis
log transformation was used to symmetrize the distributions of glucose, insulin, and salivary cortisol concentrations. where variables were
adjusted, e.g. for age, sex, and bmi, this was done by adding the mean
value of the unadjusted variable to the residuals from a multiple regression analysis with age, sex, and bmi as the predictor variables.
interactions between a binary haplotype and a continuous predictor
were tested by including in a regression analysis both terms and their
product. the product term measures directly the difference in slope of
the outcome variable on the continuous predictor in the two subgroups
defined by the genotype. all analyses were performed with spss version
12.0.1.

expression analysis
because haplotype 3, which was consistently associated with the
phenotypic data, does not include any known amino acid changing
snps, we measured the relative haplotype-3-specific mrna expression
level. dna samples were screened to find three heterozygous individuals for a silent coding snp that tags haplotype 3 (rs6196). rna of these
three heterozygous individuals was extracted from frozen human thymus tissue by trizol (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the extracted rna
was further purified using the rnaeasy total rna isolation kit
(qiagen, chatsworth, ca), followed by dnase (qiagen) treatment
to eliminate genomic dna contamination. first-strand cdna was synthesized from 0.5 ␮g total rna in a 25-␮l reaction volume by rt using
random hexamers (promega, madison, wi) and m-mlv reverse transcriptase (promega). a transcript containing rs6196 in exon 9␣ was pcr
amplified by using 2 ␮l cdna as a template and forward primer in exon
7 (tgaaaaccttactgcttctctcttc) and reverse primer in exon 9
(cgactttctttaaggcaacca). this prevents the amplification of
remaining genomic dna because the two introns are too long to be
amplified by pcr. after the quality check by agarose gel electrophoresis,
rt-pcr products were purified enzymatically with exo-sapit (amersham biosciences) by incubating at 37 c for 60 min and heat inactivated
at 72 c for 15 min. genomic dna of the same individuals was pcr
amplified by using the forward primer in intron 8 (tgagatgttcccactgacca) and the reverse primer shown above. purified products were then sequenced using the forward primers. rt was performed
twice for each three individual rna samples, each cdna sample was
pcr amplified twice, and each rt-pcr product was sequenced twice,

producing finally eight measurements for each individual rna sample.

dummy variables for individual samples were used as covariates (spss
version 12.0.1).
the study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of helsinki university central hospital and the national public health institute, and informed written consent was obtained from each participant.

rautanen et al. • gr gene, birth size, and glucose tolerance

women were 3289 g (1770 –5070 g) and 49.7 cm (43.0 –57.0
cm). haplotype 3 of the gr locus was associated with size at
birth; carriers of this haplotype had lower birth weight and
length at birth compared with noncarriers (table 2). gr
haplotype was unrelated to ponderal index, which is a measure of newborn thinness, and gestational age at birth.
hpaa function

gr gene haplotype 3 was weakly associated with increased fasting serum total cortisol concentrations and free
cortisol index (table 2) but not with cbg concentration.
more detailed assessment of hpaa function performed in
162 women showed that haplotype 3 was associated with
increased morning salivary cortisol (awakening response
and a single measurement next morning) and mean salivary
cortisol concentration during a 24-h follow-up and, by marginal significance, with increased cortisol concentration after
1 ␮g acth1–24 stimulation (table 2). no relationship was
seen with overnight 0.25 mg dexamethasone suppression.
interactive effects with size at birth on hpaa function

table 3 shows that the relationship between gr haplotype
and cortisol concentrations was dependent on length at birth.
because of the small number of haplotype 3 homozygotes
(22), we present combined data for all haplotype 3 carriers.
haplotype 3 was associated with high fasting total and free
cortisol only in subjects who were short at birth. conversely,
short length at birth predicted high cortisol only in carriers
of haplotype 3. in these subjects, a 1-cm decrease in length
at birth corresponded to 15.2 [95% confidence interval (ci),
0.3–30.2] nmol/liter increase in total cortisol, whereas in
noncarriers, no relationship was seen (1 cm corresponding to
⫺1.5; 95% ci, ⫺8.5 to 11.5 nmol/liter change). the p values
for interaction between the effects of length at birth and
haplotype 3 were 0.06 for total cortisol and 0.01 for free
cortisol index.

interactive effects with size at birth on glucose tolerance

within the total study group, gr haplotype was unrelated
to the prevalence of diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or
glucose concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test.
because we have previously shown in this cohort that small
body size at birth predicts impaired/reduced glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes (4), we assessed whether this relationship is different in subjects with different gr haplotypes (table 4). in subjects with gr haplotype 3, 1 cm of
decrease in length at birth was associated with a 1.36-fold
odds ratio (95% ci, 1.09 –1.70; p ⫽ 0.007) for developing
impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes and 5.8% (95%
ci, 2.5–9.1%; p ⫽ 0.0007) higher 120-min glucose at an oral
glucose tolerance test, whereas in noncarriers of this haplotype, there was no association, corresponding odds ratio
being 0.99 (95% ci, 0.85–1.16; p ⫽ 0.9) and change in 120-min
glucose ⫺0.2% (⫺3.2 to 2.8%; p ⫽ 0.9). interaction between
the effects of length at birth and haplotype 3 were significant
for impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes (p ⫽ 0.02)
and 120-min glucose (p ⫽ 0.01). also, higher fasting glucose
concentrations were associated with short length at birth in
haplotype 3 carriers (p ⫽ 0.03) but not in noncarriers (p ⫽ 0.8)
(p for interaction ⫽ 0.07).
allele-specific expression

as calculated from sequencing electropherogram (fig 2),
the average c/t allele peak height ratios were 0.831 (sd,
0.043) for genomic dna and 0.778 (sd, 0.047) for cdna
samples. therefore, the expression level of allele c, which
tags haplotype 3, is 93.7% (95% ci, 90.5–96.8%; p ⫽ 2.2 ⫻
10⫺4) of the expression level of allele t, which refers to the
other haplotypes.
discussion

we found that a common haplotype (haplotype 3) in the
gr gene is associated with short length and low weight at
birth and higher indices of hpaa function in later life. this

finding supports the hypothesis that common variation in
the gr gene may act as a mediator of the relationship between size at birth and adult hpaa function. our findings
were, however, not limited to these direct associations. relationships of short length at birth with adult hpaa function
and impaired glucose regulation were confined to carriers of
haplotype 3, suggesting that these individuals are more susceptible to early-life programming of these adult phenotypes. furthermore, haplotype 3 was associated with reduced expression of the gr gene, supporting a causative role
of this haplotype in explaining these relationships.
the search for genes underlying multifactorial diseases
has been unrewarding. one of the major critiques concerning
the large-scale genetic association studies has been their inability to incorporate environmental factors. the developtable 4. glucose tolerance in 65- to 75-yr-old subjects according

mental origins of health and disease hypothesis proposes
that environmental factors during early life cause lifelong
alterations in the functions of different organs that have large
impact on disease risk, i.e. susceptibility to adult diseases is
programmed during early life (1, 35). attempts have also
been made to explain the association between small size at
birth and adult disease by the genetic hypothesis suggesting
that these phenotypes are merely two independent outcomes
of the same genotype. originally, this hypothesis was presented as the fetal insulin hypothesis, which proposes that
genetic factors determine insulin resistance, which results in
low birth weight (36). in the current study, we propose a
synthesis of these hypotheses suggesting that an individual’s
susceptibility to specific mechanism of programming is affected by his/her genetic make-up.
our present findings add to our previous observations in
the helsinki birth cohort study that have shown interactions
between the effects of body size at birth and certain wellestablished genetic variants on late-life glucose tolerance and
related phenotypes. these variants include pro12ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
␥ (ppar-␥2) (4), k121q polymorphism in plasma cell glycoprotein 1 ( xxxg707xxx ) (37), and the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) (32)
genes. these findings can be interpreted as examples of interactions between genotype and intrauterine environment
with resulting changes in gene expression.
previous studies of gr gene have focused primarily on the
following three polymorphisms: n363s (rs6195), er22/23ek
(two snps in complete linkage disequilibrium, rs6189 and
rs6190), and intronic bcli restriction site polymorphism formerly known as 2.3- and 4.5-kb alleles, but recently identified
to constitute a c to g substitution in intron 2 (17). locations
for these polymorphisms are shown in fig. 1a. instead of
these individual polymorphisms, we chose to study the haplotype structure of the gr gene to encompass a major proportion of common variation in the gene. furthermore, we
excluded very rare polymorphisms because they have potential to explain only a very small fraction of variation in
response to glucocorticoids seen between individuals.
rs6195 (n363s) resides in the haplotype (haplotype 5) that
differs from the most common haplotype only by this one
snp. in our material, rs6195 did not associate with any measured phenotype (data not shown), although the power of the
present study was not sufficient to assess the correlates of this
relatively rare polymorphism. snps rs6189 and rs6190
(er22/23ek) have been reported to be relatively rare (1.6%)
(34). in our pilot genotyping of 91 individuals, they were
monomorphic and were therefore discarded from the current
study. according to a recent comprehensive analysis of haplotype structure of the gr locus by stevens et al. (34), the
haplotype including the er22/23ek polymorphism differs
from our haplotype 4 only by these two snps. although
these researchers used a largely different set of snps in their
haplotype analysis, we were able to match our haplotypes to
theirs (shown in fig. 1b in addition to haplotypes according
to hapmap). our observed haplotype frequencies correspond well to those shown by stevens et al. (34) and hapmap
data (fig. 1b). we did not genotype the bcli polymorphism,
but all carriers of haplotype 2 and haplotype 3 have been

reported to carry also the bcli 4.5-kb allele (34) (see fig. 1b).
we are unaware of any studies assessing the effect of the
noncoding bcli polymorphism on gene expression. it is possible that this polymorphism and haplotype 3 in the present
study may reflect the same causative variant.
the rs6196 (n766n) polymorphism, which tags our haplotype 3, has not been studied as extensively as the above
mentioned three polymorphisms. it has, however, been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in the japanese
population (38). in the study by stevens et al. (34), the haplotype that corresponds to our haplotype 3 was associated
with low post-dexamethasone cortisol. although we did not
observe this association, our results are difficult to compare
because no other assessment of hpaa function was performed in their study (34). as fig. 1 shows, haplotype 3 is the
most diverged one from the most common haplotype 1,
which makes it even more interesting as a risk haplotype.
because haplotype 3 does not include any known coding
nonsynonymous snps, we assumed that its phenotypic effects are most probably based on the altered allele-specific
expression level of gr. indeed, we found that the mrna
expression level of haplotype 3 in human thymus was consistently lower than that of the other haplotypes. the expression level of gr is critical for cell function; a 30 –50%
reduction of gr expression level has been shown to result in
severe neuroendocrine, metabolic, and immunological abnormalities in transgenic mice (39). our findings suggest that
even a lesser reduction in the expression level could play a
role in explaining normal phenotypic variation between individuals. that the association of body size at birth with
adult glucose tolerance and hpaa function was confined to
carriers of haplotype 3 implies an interaction between genotype and intrauterine environment. whether this is explained by a more pronounced haplotype-specific decrease
of gr expression level in individuals who were born small
remains to be confirmed. the haplotype 3 tagging snp
(rs6196) resides in exon 9␣; therefore, our expression studies
exclude the gr-␤ splice variant, which is transcriptionally
inactive but serves as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the
gr-␣ isoform (40).

because the negative feedback mechanism of the hpaa is
dependent on grs, decreased gr expression could lead to
higher cortisol levels as a result of impaired feedback control.
superficially, this may seem to be in contrast with our finding
of no difference in dexamethasone-suppressed cortisol and
a previous finding of augmented dexamethasone suppression (34) associated with haplotype 3. however, the dexamethasone suppression test is mostly an indicator of suppression at the pituitary level because dexamethasone does
not pass freely through the blood-brain barrier (41). reduced
gr expression at the higher levels of the axis such as hypothalamus or hippocampus could as well lead to increased
hpaa activity, although this remains speculative because
specific assessment of negative feedback at these levels is
difficult by any functional hpaa tests. similarly, for obvious
reasons, we were unable to measure the haplotype-3-specific
gr expression in these sites. although we cannot exclude
tissue-specific differences, thymus, which we used, is expected to be as valid as any other tissue, because gr is
ubiquitously expressed. moreover, we found that other measures of hpaa function, such as cortisol after acth stimulation and 24-h salivary cortisol, were higher in haplotype
3 carriers than in noncarriers, indicating hyperactivity of the
hpaa. although the reduced gr expression in peripheral
tissues could be expected to attenuate the effects of such
hyperactivity, glucocorticoids are well known to induce insulin resistance in humans (42, 43), and impaired glucose
tolerance and type 2 diabetes are key features of frank glucocorticoid excess caused by cushing’s disease (44) or pharmacological treatment (43). recent findings have suggested
that normal individual variations in hpaa function are also
associated with differences in glucose tolerance (9, 26, 45, 46),
making variations in hpaa function, whether genetically or
environmentally determined, plausible mechanisms to link
early-life events with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2
diabetes in adult life.
we conclude that a common gr haplotype, which affects
gene expression, modifies the association between short
length at birth and hpaa function and glucose tolerance in
adult life. the success of most large-scale genetic studies on

aiming at understanding the etiology of glucose tolerance
and related traits.
