novel agonists for g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) are
often identified in high-throughput screens based on receptor
coupling to alternative g proteins that mobilize ca2⫹ (e.g.,
g␣15) (for review, see milligan and kostenis, 2006). in such a
screen, the profile of an agonist may differ from how it behaves when the receptor is coupled to its native g protein
(e.g., gi). furthermore, the emax and ec50 values for triggering a response may vary, depending on the signaling pathway and response being measured. if the emax values of a
group of agonists differ within an assay, it is impossible to
compare agonist activity accurately using potency ratios.
to understand how drug-receptor interactions influence
the output of a functional assay, it is useful to consider
different hierarchical levels of analysis of drug action (fig. 1).
on the surface (fig. 1a), the behavior of an agonist in an
assay can be characterized by its ec50 and emax values,
which depend not only on the receptor but on other elements
in the signaling pathway as described. at a deeper level of

rai values for agonists across m1 to m4 muscarinic subtypes
stably transfected in chinese hamster ovary cells. our results
show selectivity of mcn-a-343 [4-i-[3-chlorophenyl]carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammnonium chloride] for the m1 and m4
subtypes and selectivity of pilocarpine for the m1 and m3 subtypes. the other agonists tested lacked marked selectivity
among m1 to m4 receptors. finally, we estimated rai values
from published literature on m1, m2, and m3 muscarinic responses and obtained results consistent with our own studies.
our results show that the rai estimate is a useful receptordependent measure of agonist activity.

analysis (fig. 1b), one can examine the relationship between
the agonist concentration and the activation state of a population of receptors. for instance, at a ligand-gated ion channel, this activation function represents the whole-cell current
or ensemble average. at a gpcr, the corresponding function
is known as the stimulus (furchgott, 1966). the maximal
stimulus is equivalent to observed intrinsic efficacy (epsilon), and
the concentration of agonist eliciting a half-maximal stimulus is equivalent to the observed dissociation constant (kobs).
observed affinity (1/kobs) and intrinsic efficacy are more
invariant than ec50 and emax, yet nonetheless, these parameter are dependent on the g protein, the concentration of
gtp, and other elements that physically interact with the
receptor (ehlert, 2000). it is possible to deduce the stimulus
through the analysis of a downstream response using furchgott’s method of partial receptor inactivation (furchgott,
1966). at an even deeper level of analysis (fig. 1c), one can
consider the microscopic affinity constants of the agonist for
the ground and active states of the receptor (colquhoun,
1998). these parameters are the ultimate determinants of
agonist activity in different assays. it is possible to estimate
these parameters at ligand-gated ion channels, in some instances, through single channel analysis (colquhoun, 1998).

abstract
we measured the intrinsic relative activity (rai) of muscarinic
agonists to detect possible selectivity for receptor subtypes
and signaling pathways. rai is a relative measure of the microscopic affinity constant of an agonist for the active state of a
gpcr expressed relative to that of a standard agonist. first, we
estimated rai values for a panel of agonists acting at the m4
muscarinic receptor coupled to three distinct g-protein pathways: gi inhibition of camp accumulation, gs stimulation of
camp accumulation, and g␣15 stimulation of phosphoinositide
hydrolysis. our results show similar rai values for each agonist,
suggesting that the same active state of the  xxxg450xxx  triggers the activation of the three g proteins. we also estimated

fig. 1. hierarchical levels of analysis of agonist action. the figure summarizes how agonist activity can be estimated at different, internally
consistent levels of analysis. at the most superficial level (a, level 1),
agonist activity is estimated from the ec50 and emax values of the measured response. these parameters depend on how the agonist interacts
with the receptor as well as various elements in the signaling pathway.
the second level of analysis (b) refers to the relationship between the
agonist concentration and the proportion of the receptor population in the
active state (i.e., stimulus). for a gpcr, this relationship depends on the
agonist-receptor interaction as well as the concentration of gtp and
proteins that physically interact with the receptor (e.g., g proteins). at
the ultimate level of analysis (c, level 3), activity is governed by the
affinity of the agonist for ground and active states of the receptor. the
goal of pharmacological analysis is to estimate these purely agonistreceptor-dependent parameters from more superficial measurements,
such as the stimulus and response to an agonist.

at a gpcr, it is impossible to estimate microscopic constants
from the concentration-response curve; however, it is possible to calculate a relative estimate of the microscopic affinity
constant of an agonist for the active state of the receptor.
analysis of the results of a recent modeling study shows that
the product of observed affinity (1/kobs) and intrinsic efficacy
(epsilon) of an agonist expressed relative to that of a standard
agonist [epsilon⬘(1/k⬘obs)] is also equivalent to the corresponding
ratio of microscopic affinity constants for the active state of
the receptor (kb/k⬘b) (ehlert 2008). this ratio is termed, intrinsic relative activity (rai).

in prior work, we showed how to estimate rai from the
concentration-response curves of the two agonists (griffin et al.,
2007). thus, although observed affinity and efficacy are complex functions of microscopic constants, their product yields a
simple constant proportional to the microscopic affinity constant of the agonist for the active state of the receptor.

cell culture. chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells stably expressing the human muscarinic m1 and m4 receptors were obtained from
acadia pharmaceuticals (san diego, ca). the expression levels of
muscarinic receptors in these cells were approximately 0.1 pmol
(cho m4), 0.2 pmol/mg protein (cho m2), 1.2 pmol/mg protein
(cho m3), and 1.3 pmol/mg protein (cho m1). hek-293t cells
stably expressing g␣15 were provided by dr. olivier civelli (university of california, irvine, ca). cho m1 cells were cultured in f-12k.
cho m4 and g␣15 hek-293t cells were cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium with high glucose plus l-glutamine. all
media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillinstreptomycin (100 units/ml), and  xxxg418xxx  (0.4 mg/ml), and cells were
cultured at 37°c with 5% co2. hek-293t g␣15 cells were also
supplemented with  xxxd3041xxx  (0.625 ␮g/ml). a plasmid containing
the human  xxxg450xxx  was obtained from the cdna resource
center (missouri university of science and technology, rolla,
mo). an empty pcdna3.1 vector was obtained from invitrogen
(carlsbad, ca). hek-293t g␣15 cells were transfected with 10 ␮g of
the human m4 vector hek g␣15 m4 or the empty plasmid hek g␣15
null using lipofectamine (5:1 lipofectamine/dna ratio) for 48 h
before experimentation.
camp accumulation. the effects of muscarinic agonists on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation were measured in cho m2
and m4 cells using a modification of the [3h]adenine-prelabeling
method as described by griffin et al. (2007). pertussis toxin treatment was accomplished by first incubating the cells with the toxin
for 16 h before the assay.
phosphoinositide hydrolysis. muscarinic agonist-mediated
stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis was measured in adherent cho cells and suspensions of hek g␣15 cells using a modification of the [3h]inositol-prelabeling method of berridge et al. (1982)
and the extraction method of kendall and hill (1990). a detailed
description of the method used for cell suspension experiments is
described in griffin et al. (2007). confluent cho m1 cell monolayers
cultured in 24-well plates or 100-mm petri dishes were washed in
krb before overnight incubation with [3h]inositol (2 ␮ci/well). on
the morning of the experiment, the 24-well plates were washed
twice with krb. after 15-min incubation with krb (270 ␮l) containing licl (10 mm), agonists (30 ␮l) were added for a subsequent
30-min incubation at 37°c in 5% co2. the reaction was stopped with
5% perchloric acid (200 ␮l), and the samples were placed on ice.

the active state of a gpcr enables one to address several
questions. for example, if different active states are involved
in coupling to different g proteins, the estimate of the agonist
rai value should change depending upon the signaling pathway. in addition, if the agonist exhibits selectivity for different receptor subtypes, its rai value should reflect this selectivity. moreover, because all that is required for estimation of
rai is the agonist concentration-response curve, it should be
possible to address these questions from previously published data. in the present report, we have tested these
postulates in connection with the subtypes of the muscarinic
receptor. using a panel of agonists, we found little difference
in agonist activity for triggering responses through the m4
receptor coupled to gi, gs, or g␣15. upon investigating agonist activity at muscarinic subtypes using rai analysis, we
confirmed the selectivity of mcn-a-343 for m1 and m4 receptors and also identified pilocarpine as an m1- and m3-selective agonist. analysis of data from the literature also yielded
a similar picture. our results show that the rai parameter is
a simple and useful estimate for comparing agonist activity
across assays.

analysis of agonist concentration response curves. emax,
ec50, and hill slope were estimated from agonist concentrationresponse curves by nonlinear regression analysis using prism
(graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca) as described previously
(griffin et al., 2007).
estimation of rai. the rai of test agonist b is defined as the
product of its observed intrinsic efficacy (epsilon) and reciprocal of its kobs
divided by that of standard agonist a as described above in eq. 1. to
avoid confusion, we have rewritten eq. 1 below with subscripts to
observed intrinsic efficacy (epsilon) and observed affinity (k) to denote the
parameters of the standard and test agonists.

global nonlinear regression analysis is done sharing the estimates

logra and logkb are obtained for each test agonist. if the standard agonist is a full agonist, the parameter logka is set as a

the derivation of the rai value and its estimation using either a
null method or the operational model have been described in detail
previously (griffin et al., 2007), and step-by-step instructions for
estimating rai using prism or a spreadsheet have also been described previously (ehlert, 2008). a brief summary of the essential
steps is given below. because the rai value is a relative measure of
agonist activity, we always ran the standard agonist carbachol in
each experiment.

using the operational method described above. in the remainder of
the cases (8 of 19), only the ec50 and emax values of the agonist were

analysis of agonist activity at the m4 muscarinic
receptor signaling through different g proteins. to
investigate how the activity of specific agonists may be modified by the g protein through which the  xxxg450xxx  signals,
we tested a panel of muscarinic agonists for their ability to
elicit responses through  xxxg450xxx  coupling to gi, gs, and
g␣15. the panel of compounds included agonists with varying structure, efficacy, and potency. the standard compound
to which the rai values of the other agonists were normalized was carbachol, selected because of its similar structure
to the endogenous neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. oxo-m
was selected as an example of a highly efficacious muscarinic
agonist (fisher and bartus, 1985). mcn-a-343 was investigated as an example of a subtype-selective agonist. this
compound was originally described as a sympathetic ganglionic stimulant (roszkowski, 1961) and has been shown more
recently to exhibit selectivity for m1 and m4 receptors (lazareno and birdsall, 1993). the enantiomers of aceclidine
(ringdahl et al., 1982) were selected as rigid analogs of
acetylcholine. the racemate has been used as a treatment for
glaucoma (fechner et al., 1975). the partial agonist, pilocarpine, and  xxxd215xxx , the natural alkaloid from betel nuts,
also were tested.

in which the subscripts refer to the parameters of the standard (a)
and test (b) agonists. this calculation is completely valid if the hill
slopes of the agonist concentration-response curves are equal to one
or if the emax values of the agonists are the same, in which case the
rai is equivalent to the potency ratio regardless of the hill slopes. in
six of the studies where the simple calculation (i.e., eq. 14) was used,
the data were from studies on second messenger responses in cell
lines transfected with subtypes of the muscarinic receptor. we have
found that agonists typically exhibit hill slopes close to one in these
types of experiments, suggesting that the simple calculation was
valid in these instances. in the remaining two cases, r-aceclidine in
the rabbit vas deferens (eltze et al., 1993) and mcn-a-343 in guinea
pig right atrium (lambrecht et al., 1993), the emax values of the
agonists were 86 and 59% of the standard agonist, respectively. we
expect the simple calculation of rai to be valid in the case of raceclidine because its emax is close to 100%. if the hill slope of
mcn-a-343 differs from that of carbachol in the right atrium substantially, the simple estimate of rai could be in error by 2- to 3-fold
(see ehlert et al., 1999).
drug and chemicals. drugs and chemicals were obtained from
the following sources: [3h]adenine and [3h]inositol (perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences, waltham, ma); f-12k, dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium, trypsin-edta, and lipofectamine (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca);  xxxg418xxx  (invivogen, san diego, ca);  xxxd215xxx , carbachol, mcn-a-343, and oxotremorine-m (oxo-m), pilocarpine (sigmaaldrich, st. louis, mo). the enantiomers of aceclidine were synthesized and resolved as described by ringdahl et al. (1979).

tor coupled to gi was tested in cho m4 cells by measuring
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx  (10 ␮m)-stimulated camp accumulation (fig. 2, a and b). carbachol, s-aceclidine, and mcn-a343 all produced concentration-response curves with similar
potency and maximal effect. oxo-m was slightly more potent
than carbachol but shared a similar maximal response,
whereas  xxxd215xxx  had a similar potency as carbachol but a
slightly decreased emax. r-aceclidine had a response both
lower in potency and maximal effect compared with carbachol. pilocarpine exhibited an ec50 at least two log units less
potent than carbachol but displayed an increased maximal
effect, although pilocarpine was not tested at higher concentrations. it is possible that pilocarpine causes a nonmuscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of camp accumulation at
high concentrations as has been previously seen with other
agonists [e.g., r-acelidine in cho cells (griffin et al., 2007)].
the emax, ec50, and hill slope of each agonist are summarized in table 1.
 xxxg450xxx -mediated stimulation of camp accumulation. it has been shown that the camp response to
muscarinic agonists in cho m2 and m4 cells is biphasic. low
concentrations of agonist mediate inhibition of camp accumulation, whereas stimulation of camp accumulation occurs
at higher concentrations of agonist (mistry et al., 2005). the
more potent inhibition of camp accumulation is prevented by
pretreatment with pertussis toxin, which unmasks the gsdependent stimulation of camp accumulation. the role of gs

based on the agonist-receptor-g protein interaction.
 xxxg450xxx -mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis
via g␣15. offermanns et al. (2001) have described how g␣15
can couple a wide variety g protein-coupled receptors to
phospholipase c-ß. as a consequence, we investigated the
ability of muscarinic agonists to stimulate the production of
inositol phosphates in hek g␣15 cells transiently transfected with the  xxxg450xxx  (hek g␣15 m4 cells). figure 4a
shows the concentration-response curves of the five agonists
tested in the hek g␣15 m4 cells. carbachol and s-aceclidine
displayed full agonism with similar potency and emax. oxo-m
also behaved as a full agonist but showed increased potency
with its concentration-response curve located over one log
unit to the left of carbachol. mcn-a-343 was as potent as
carbachol at stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis but had
a decreased emax, whereas r-aceclidine exhibited both lower
potency and emax. table 3 lists the emax, ec50, and hill slope
values of agonists for these responses.
in a prior study, we showed that an endogenous  xxxg449xxx  elicits a weak phosphoinositide response in
the hek g␣15 cell (griffin et al., 2007). therefore, muscarinic responses measured in hek g␣15 cells transiently
transfected with the  xxxg450xxx  should represent the sum of
m3 and m4 responses. to quantify the magnitude of the m3
component, we measured agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in hek g␣15 cells transfected with an empty
pcdna3.1 vector (hek g␣15 null, see fig. 4b). in general,
the activities of all of the agonists were much less in these
cells. oxo-m produced a maximal response similar to that of
carbachol but exhibited 10-fold greater potency. s-aceclidine
exhibited similar potency to carbachol but had a lower emax
value. neither mcn-a-343 nor r-aceclidine produced measurable concentration-dependent agonism in the hek g␣15
null cells. control experiments with hek g␣15 m4 cells
treated with pertussis toxin show a lack of contribution of gi/o
signaling to the phosphoinositide hydrolysis measured upon
stimulation by the muscarinic agonists (data not shown).
estimation of agonist rai values for m4 responses
elicited through gi, gs, and g␣15. the rai values of
agonists for eliciting responses through gi (fig. 2), gs (fig.

has been confirmed in small interference rna studies
(michal et al., 2007). we investigated the ability of muscarinic agonists to enhance the camp accumulation elicited by
a low concentration of  xxxd1742xxx  (0.1 ␮m) in cho m4 cells
treated with pertussis toxin (see figs. 3, a and b, and table
2). oxo-m stimulated an increase in camp accumulation
with a maximal effect and potency significantly higher than
those of carbachol, whereas the emax and potency of s-aceclidine were lower than those of carbachol. both mcn-a-343
and r-aceclidine failed to produce substantial concentrationdependent increases in camp accumulation. the potency of
carbachol for inhibiting camp accumulation is more than 1.3
log units higher than that for stimulating camp accumulation in pertussis toxin-treated cells, illustrating the low sensitivity of the cho m4 gs assay. this reduced sensitivity can

(carbachol and oxo-m). the concentration-response curves
from both cell lines were analyzed simultaneously, sharing
the estimates of the m3 parameters between both curves and
using only the hek g␣15 m4 cells for estimation of the m4
parameters. in this manner, the m4 component of the phosphoinositide response in hek g␣15 m4 cells was determined.
further details of the calculations are given under materials
and methods. this analysis enabled us to estimate two rai
values for an agonist: one for the m3 response and one for the
m4 response. this careful analysis ultimately showed that
the estimate of rai value for the m4 component in the hek
g␣15 m4 cells was practically the same as that estimated
assuming that the entire response was elicited by the m4
receptor. presumably, the endogenous m3 response was too
insensitive to influence the m4 response significantly.

r-aceclidine exhibited the lowest rai values. none of the
agonists exhibited a marked difference in activity for eliciting
m4 responses through the three different g proteins. no rai
value was calculated for mcn-a-343 and r-aceclidine in the

comparison of agonist activity across m1 to m4 muscarinic receptors. we used our rai estimates to compare
the activity of agonists across the m1 to m4 subtypes of the
muscarinic receptor. for this analysis, we used data generated from our laboratory in which the test and standard
agonists were assayed in the same experiment to minimize
variation between experiments. most of the rai estimates for
the  xxxg448xxx  were taken from griffin et al. (2007) in which
 xxxg448xxx -mediated inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp accumulation was measured. we ran additional experiments with  xxxd215xxx  and pilocarpine, and the combined
results are given in table 5. the data for the  xxxg449xxx  are
from ehlert et al. (1999). additional data on the  xxxg447xxx 
were obtained and are described below to give a complete
picture of activity across the m1 to m4 subtypes.
our data on agonist-mediated stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cho m1 cells are shown in fig. 6, a and
b. most of the agonists exhibited a similar maximal response,
with the exception of the enantiomers of aceclidine whose
emax values were moderately lower. in addition, most of the
agonists exhibited similar potency with the striking exception of oxo-m, which exhibited approximately 10-fold greater
potency than carbachol. the potency of pilocarpine was approximately one-fourth that of carbachol. these data are
summarized in table 4.
agonist rai values at m1 to m4 muscarinic receptors. a summary of the rai estimates for agonists across m1

estimated using the operational method. for this analysis,
rai values were estimated from phosphoinositide assays in
cho m1 and cho m3 cells and from camp assays on cho
m2 and cho m4 cells in which the inhibition of camp accumulation elicited by  xxxd1742xxx  was measured. oxo-m displayed increased agonist activity relative to carbachol across
the m1 to m4 muscarinic subtypes, with an especially high
rai value of 30 at the  xxxg447xxx  and values of 4.0 to 6.6 at
the other subtypes. s-aceclidine,  xxxd215xxx , and r-aceclidine
exhibited approximately uniform activity at the m1 to m4
subtypes. the former two compounds had activity similar to
carbachol, whereas r-aceclidine exhibited approximately
one-tenth the activity of carbachol. the most selective com-

the operational rai values for oxotremorine-m and carbachol were estimated using eqs. 10 through 13, whereas those for mcn-a-343, s-aceclidine, and r-aceclidine were
estimated using eqs. 8 and 9. in each analysis the concentration-response curve of carbachol was analyzed simultaneously as the standard.

lower activity at the m2 (0.0020) and m3 (0.019) subtypes.
the rai values of mcn-a-343 at the m1 and m4 subtypes
were comparable with those of carbachol. pilocarpine exhibited activity less than carbachol but showed selectivity between the muscarinic subtypes; its rai values for the m1
(0.49) and m3 (0.15) subtypes were much higher than those
for the m2 (0.015) and m4 (0.013) receptors. one way analysis

given agonist at a given receptor subtype. to investigate this
issue, we calculated the rai values of selected agonists for
eliciting responses through m1, m2, and m3 muscarinic receptors. five published studies were used to compare agonist
activity at the  xxxg447xxx  in addition to our own just described. agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was
analyzed from studies by richards and van giersbergen
(1995) (cho m1), schwarz et al. (1993) (cho m1), and mei et
al. (1991) (b82 fibroblasts transfected with the  xxxg447xxx );
agonist-stimulated gtpase activity in cho m1 cells (lazareno and birdsall, 1993) was also analyzed. we also examined the data of eltze et al. (1993) on  xxxg447xxx -mediated
inhibition of electrically stimulated contraction in rabbit vas
deferens. however, there is some question that this response
may be mediated by the  xxxg450xxx  as described under
discussion. four studies on cell lines, three on myocardial
homogenates, and two on the isolated left atrium were selected for comparison of m2 rai values. the studies on cell
lines included experiments on the inhibition of camp accumulation in cho m2 cells by griffin et al. (2007), mistry et
al. (2005), mckinney et al. (1991), and wang and el-fakahany (1993). the studies on inhibition of adenylate cyclase
activity in myocardial homogenates included those of ehlert
(1985), keen and nahorski (1988), and ehlert et al. (1996).
the studies on the isolated, guinea pig left atrium were from
christopoulos and mitchelson (1997) and lambrecht et al.
(1993). rai values for the  xxxg449xxx  were estimated from
studies measuring contraction in the guinea pig ileum and
phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cells and tissues. the data on
phosphoinositide hydrolysis were from ek and nahorski
(1988) (parotid gland and ileum), matsumoto et al. (1994)
(ciliary muscle), and ehlert et al. (1999) (cho m3 cells). the
data on the contractility of the ileum was from ringdahl et al.
(1982), hanin et al. (1966), and ehlert et al. (1999). rai
values were calculated as described under materials and
methods and plotted as scatter plots for comparison in fig. 8.
we have indicated those values that were calculated from the
rabbit vas deferens with an asterisk because this tentative
m1 response may actually be an m4 response. if the emax of
the standard and reference agonist were the same, the rai
would be estimated as the potency ratio (see griffin et al.,
2007).
the greatest variation in rai values was noted at the m2
receptor (standard deviation of log rai ⫽ 0.45; 2.8-fold), the
least variation at the  xxxg449xxx  (standard deviation of log
rai ⫽ 0.14; 1.4-fold), and intermediate variation at the m1
receptor (standard deviation of log rai ⫽ 0.39; 2.5-fold).

differences at the m1 to m3 subtypes. oxo-m had geometric
mean rai values of 15.5, 8.6, and 3.0 at the m1, m2, and m3
subtypes, respectively, suggesting increased activity at the
m1 and m2 receptors relative to m3. mcn-a-343 exhibited the
greatest variation in rai values across subtypes (172-fold)
with a geometric mean of 0.70 at the  xxxg447xxx  and lower
values of 0.0041 and 0.023 at m2 and m3 receptors, respectively. the corresponding rai values for pilocarpine at the
m1 to m3 subtypes are 0.63, 0.012, and 0.19, suggesting
selectivity primarily for m1 and m3 receptors over m2.
assessment of rai values for an agonist within the same
receptor type highlights differences between studies. rai
values for r-aceclidine at the  xxxg447xxx  vary from 0.017 in
the rabbit vas deferens of eltze et al. (1993) to 0.22 in cho
m1 cell data from this study. the variation in rai estimates
at the  xxxg447xxx  is also seen for oxotremorine, with rai
values ranging from 3.2 at the  xxxg447xxx  in murine fibroblasts by mei et al. (1991) to 50 calculated from gtpase
activity in cho m1 cells by lazareno et al. (1993). as shown
in fig. 8, the rai value (6.1) for pilocarpine from lazareno et
al. (1993) was also much higher than that estimated for
pilocarpine in four other studies analyzed (0.49, 0.33, 0.35,
and 0.28), in which phosphoinositide hydrolysis was measured in either cho m1 or b82 m1 cells. oxo-m, mcn-a-343,
s-aceclidine, and  xxxd215xxx  show less variation in rai values
between the m1 studies evaluated.

the rai values for oxo-m at the  xxxg448xxx  vary from 2.7
(ehlert et al., 1996) to 30 (ehlert 1985). these studies both
investigated cardiac adenylate cyclase activity but in different species (rat and rabbit, respectively). the rai values for
mcn-a-343, oxo-m,  xxxd215xxx , r-aceclidine, and pilocarpine
also show greater than a log unit range across m2 studies.
s-aceclidine has the least difference in rai estimates of all
compounds illustrated in fig. 8, with a standard deviation of
log rai values of 0.21. as described above, the variance in
agonist rai values is substantially decreased when surveying m3-based assays.

discussion
the rai value is a relative measure of the microscopic
affinity constant of an agonist for the active state of the
receptor. therefore, if different active states are involved in
the coupling of a gpcr to different g proteins, different rai
values might be expected. a panel of muscarinic agonists,
carbachol, oxo-m, mcn-a-343, s-aceclidine, and r-aceclidine,
were assessed for possible selectivity for different active
states of the  xxxg450xxx  coupling to gi, gs, or g␣15. our data
with the  xxxg450xxx  provide no evidence for different active
states of the  xxxg450xxx . this result may suggest that measurement of m4 activation via g␣15 is an appropriate substitute for estimating agonist activity at the  xxxg450xxx  signaling through gi, but it is conceivable that other novel agonists
may preferentially direct signaling at the  xxxg450xxx 
through one g protein more than another. for example, at
the  xxxg448xxx , it has been shown that mcn-a-343 has
10-fold greater activity when activating  xxxg448xxx  signaling via g␣15 versus gi (griffin et al., 2007). therefore, before

implementation of a cellular screen based on alternative g
protein signaling, it would seem prudent to use rai in conjunction with as many well characterized agonists as possible
to evaluate potential differences in signaling caused by alternative g protein coupling. agonist concentrations required to
increase camp via m4 signaling through gs were much
higher than those required to inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp via m4 signaling through gi, suggesting a possible
physiological irrelevance of the m4 activation via gs. nonetheless, this pathway does provide an additional example of
the use of rai in alternative screening paradigms.

because the rai value is a relative measure of the microscopic affinity constant of an agonist for the active state of
the receptor, its use represents an improvement in prior
characterizations of the m1 to m4 subtypes requiring the two
parameters, ec50 and emax. rai also presents an advantage
over the use of potency ratios because rai can be calculated
in assays in which the agonists elicit different maximal responses. a rank order of agonist activity, based on selectivity
for the active state, is given in table 6. our data on cho m1
cells generally agrees with published data. two moderate
differences are with regard to  xxxd215xxx  and pilocarpine,
which gave a higher level of maximal stimulation (118 and
119%, respectively) than previously shown in studies on the
phosphoinositide response in cho m1 cells by schwarz et al.
(1993) (87 and 66%, respectively) and richards and van
giersbergen (1995) (85 and 76%, respectively).
in this study, mcn-a-343 displayed increased rai values
at the m1 and m4 receptors compared with m2 and m3. this
pattern correlates with previous data indicating selectivity of
mcn-a-343 for both m1 and m4 muscarinic receptors (lazareno et al., 1993). roszkowski (1961) first described the pressor effect of mcn-a-343 in cats and suggested that this response was mediated by activation of a neuronal muscarinic
receptor (m1) in sympathetic ganglia triggering catecholamine release. in the rabbit vas deferens, mcn-a-343 inhibits the contractile response to electrical field stimulation, and
this response is blocked potently by the m1-selective antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  (eltze, 1988). it is conceivable that this
response is mediated by the  xxxg450xxx  because  xxxd2965xxx 
exhibits moderately high affinity for the  xxxg450xxx  (pkd ⫽
7.23) in addition to its high affinity for the  xxxg447xxx 
(pkd ⫽ 7.77) (ehlert et al., 1997). in cell lines, mcn-a-343
exhibits greater potency and maximal effect at stimulating
gtpase activity in cho m4 cells, compared with that observed in cho m1 cells, but exhibits much lower activity at
the m2 and m3 subtypes (lazareno et al., 1993).
pilocarpine exhibited rai values of 0.49, 0.015, 0.21, and
0.01 across m1 to m4 receptors, respectively, indicating selectivity for m1 and m3 receptors compared with m2 and m4.
pilocarpine has previously been shown to exhibit selectivity
for the  xxxg447xxx  based on its activation of gtpase activity
in cho m1 cells (lazareno and birdsall, 1993). more recently, fox et al. (2001) showed that the salivating effect of
pilocarpine is due to its selective stimulation of m1 and m3
receptors present on salivary glands, and gautam et al.
(2004) described how the salivary effect of pilocarpine is
prevented in m1/ xxxg449xxx  double-knockout mice. these
data and those of hammer et al. (1980) and buckley and
burnsock (1986), showing high-affinity binding sites for
 xxxd2965xxx  in the rat submaxillary gland, are consistent
with the expression of both m1 and m3 receptors in this
tissue. our demonstration of the m1 and m3 selectivity of
pilocarpine may explain its utility in sjogren’s syndrome for
the treatment of dry mouth. selectivity of pilocarpine has
also been investigated centrally; bymaster et al. (2003)
showed that seizures were induced in mice by pilocarpine
activation of the  xxxg447xxx .
the final section of this report compared rai values for
selected agonists in 19 previously published studies dating
from hanin et al. (1966) to griffin et al. (2007). if two assays
are based upon the same receptor but provide significantly
different rai values for a compound, it may indicate a differ-

ence in the active state of the g protein-receptor complex
between the two assays or simply variability. it should be
noted that, in evaluating historical data, there is no knowledge of whether the control agonist was tested within the
same experiment as the test agonist and, hence, whether
control for possible interassay variability was adequate.
there is a distinct lack of variation in the estimates of rai by
different investigators for agonist activity at the  xxxg449xxx 
(fig. 7). with the exception of the rai of  xxxd215xxx  in the
ciliary muscle of the rabbit (matsumoto et al., 1994), all
agonists presented very similar rai values across the different studies, which investigated phosphoinositide hydrolysis
in cell lines, glands, and smooth muscle and contraction in
the guinea pig ileum (hanin et al., 1966; ringdahl et al.,
1979; ek and nahorski, 1988; ehlert et al., 1996, 1999).
variability in agonist activity across assays was evident in
the m1 and m2 sets of data. at the  xxxg447xxx , pilocarpine
showed greater than a 20-fold difference between the high
value from lazareno et al. (1993) and the low value from
schwarz et al. (1993). these studies both used cho m1 cells;
however, lazareno et al. (1993) measured gtpase activity,
whereas schwarz et al. (1993) measured phosphoinositide
hydrolysis. the high rai value of pilocarpine in the gtpase
assay might be attributed to a particularly low potency re-

sponse of carbachol, the standard to which other agonists
were compared. rai values for all other agonists, with the
exception of oxo-m, tested in the study of lazareno et al.
(1993) are higher than those calculated from other m1-based
studies, suggesting unusually low activity for carbachol. the
pattern of selectivity that we observed in our studies (fig. 6)
is generally consistent with data from the literature on the
m1 to m3 subtypes (fig. 7). that is, both sets of data show
that oxotremorine, s-aceclidine, r-aceclidine, and  xxxd215xxx 
lack selectivity, whereas mcn-a-343 exhibits selectivity for
m1 relative to m2 and m3, pilocarpine exhibits selectivity for
m1 and m3 relative to m2, and oxo-m exhibits selectivity
for the m1 relative to m3. the data from the literature,
however, do not support an m1 selectivity of oxo-m relative to
m2, perhaps because of variation in rai estimates at the m2
receptor. the rai value calculated for r-aceclidine in the m1
rabbit vas deferens assay (eltze et al., 1993) is more than
10-fold lower than that calculated here in the cho m1 cells.
r-aceclidine is a good substrate for acetylcholinesterase
(pyttel and robinson, 1973). therefore, its activity may be
reduced in the isolated tissue because of cholinesterases but
not in cho m1 cells, which lack these enzymes.
the potency and ability of an agonist to turn on a gpcr
depends on its microscopic affinity constants for ground and
active states of the receptor (colquhoun, 1998; kenakin,
2007; ehlert, 2008). it is currently impossible to determine
each microscopic affinity constant from the kinds of data we
have analyzed; nonetheless, rai does provide a relative estimate of the microscopic affinity constant of the active state of
the receptor. this parameter is completely dependent on the
properties of the agonist and the receptor and is completely
independent of g proteins and other elements in the signaling cascade. if there are multiple active conformations of the
receptor available to the agonist, as well as multiple g proteins or effectors, the rai estimate represents a weighted
average, depending on the receptor conformations selected by
the ligand and attendant effectors (e.g., g proteins). al-

et al. (1993) on the rabbit vas deferens because there is a question whether this response is m1 (as indicated in the figure) or m4.

agonist activity at muscarinic receptor subtypes

though it may seem that the g protein has an influence on
the estimate of rai, g proteins actually provide a window for
detecting different active conformations of the receptor. with
defined experimental systems, it should be possible to estimate rai for specific gpcr-g protein pairs, similar to our
results shown in fig. 4, making rai analysis a powerful tool
for quantifying ligand-directed signaling.

this appendix describes the derivation of eqs. 10 through
13, which were used for the analysis of the concentrationresponse curves in hek g␣15 m4 and hek g␣15 null
cells. these equations are based on the operational model
(black and leff, 1983), which describes the agonist concentration-response curve as a logistic function of the stimulus (s).
