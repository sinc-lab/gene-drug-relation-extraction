the binding of t-[3h]butylbicycloorthobenzoate
([3h]t130b) to crude synaptosornal membranes of the mouse brain (cerebrum
minus cortex) in the presence of dihydroergotoxine, dihydroergosine, dihydroergotamine and y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) was
studied in vitro. [3h)tbob binding was inhibited by all drugs used. the rank order of potency was dihydroergotoxine > gaba
> dihydroergosine > dihydroergotamine.
this suggests that dihydrogenated ergot compounds, especially dihydroergotoxine,
possess appreciable binding activity (comparable to that of benzodiazepines and barbiturates) at the gaba, receptor-associated
cl - ionophore.

1. introduction
the gaba, receptor is an oligomeric allosteric
protein complex containing binding sites for yaminobutyric acid (gaba), benzodiazepines,
 xxxd2947xxx /b‘~~~~turates, as well as the chloride ionophore
(olsen, 1931). ergot compounds are potent drugs at
central dopamine,
serotonin and a-adrenoceptors
(hruska and silbergeld,
19811. the results of several
studies suggest that these drugs might also be active at
gaba, receptors. it has recently been reported that
one of the naturally occurring ergot alkaloids, dihydroergosine, affects the occurrence and latency of convulsions produced by antagonists of gaba, receptors
(peri%? and manev, 1990). similar results have previously been obtained with another ergot compound,
dihydroergotoxine (perieie and manev, 19831. in vitro,
dihydroergosine modulates gaba/bicucuiline
and the
cl- ionophore binding site in a manner that is consistent with the observed effects of this drug in vivo
(peri% and tvrdeid 1990).
although ergot alkaloids are widely used, especially
in geriatric patients, no attempt has been made to
investigate more closely the interaction of these compounds with specific binding sites on the brain gaba,
receptor complex. therefore, the aim of this study was

binding; gaba,

to find out whether dihydrogenated ergot compounds
interact with the binding of t-[~~]bu~lbicycl~rthobenzoate ([“hitbob) (a iigand that binds to the
gaba, receptor-integrated cl- ionophore) to synaptosomal membranes isolated from part of the mouse
brain (cerebrum minus cortex). this brain region was
chosen since our preliminary experiments have shown
the greatest binding activity of ergot drugs in this brain
region.

2. materials and methods
2. i. animals

female cba/hzgr mice from our institute, weighing 20-25 g, were used. they were housed at a constant
temperature (22°c) and under a light cycle of 11 h
light/l3 h darkness (lights on  xxxd2274xxx : 00 a.m.). food and
water were freely available.
2.2. drugs
dihydroergosine methane sulphonate, dihydroergotamine methane sulphonate (ditamin), and dihydroergotoxine methane suiphonate ( xxxd2020xxx ), all from lek.
ljubljana,
yugoslavia, were used. gaba and  xxxd2947xxx  were from sigma, st. louis, mo. [‘hitbob
(specific activity 29.8 ci/mmol) was purchased from
amersham.

btiice \vere killed by cewical dislocation, and a crude
svnaptosomal membrane fraction was prepared as de&bed by tu~~~~~iff et al. ff985f. briefly, the brains
\vere rapidly removed and dissected, the cortex and
cerebellum were discarded. and the rest of the brain
(cerebrum minus cerebral cortex) from four mice was
~~o~~d and ~~rno~e~~z~~
in 30 volumes of ice-cold so
ml\il tris citrate buffer (ph = 7.4). the homogenate
was pelleted at -!oc in b sorvall centrifuge for 10 min
at 17 #x1 x g. l‘he sarnpfes were rehomog~nized and
repeileted under the same conditions five more times.
before the last centrifugation the pellet was washed
once with ice-cold tris citrate buffer containing 500
mm nac!. this procedure enhances the binding of
~-~~~tbqb to its binding sites at the gaba,\ receptor
complex (lawrence et al.. 19xsf. the final pellet was
resuspended in the binding assay buffer (so mm tris
citrate with 500 mm naci, ph = 7.4 at l)y’cj.

the

binding assay was performed according to the
method of lawrence et al. f198sf. briefly, the drugs
(0.05 ml), i mm (final concentration)  xxxd2947xxx  to
define non-specific binding (0.05 ml), and assay buffer
were added to test tubes and pre~n~ubated in duplicate
with 0.3 ml of the synaptosomaf membrane suspension
for 30 min at 25°c. after the prein~ubatio~, binding
was initiated by adding o.qs ml of [“hitbob (final
concentration 4.0 nmf. incubations were terminated 30
min thereafter by filtration of os ml of the incubation
mixture through whatman gf/c filters. the filters
were rapidly rinsed twice with 5 ml of assay buffer,
transferred to counting vials and dried. after addition
of scintillation cocktail (toluene, ppo, popop), radioactivity retained in the filters was counted by liquid
scintillation spectroscopy at 50% efficiency. specific
~~hitbob binding was defined as the difference between binding ‘in the absence of p~crotoxin and was
ho-70% of the total binding.
the binding data were analysed using a computerbased ebda program. ebda calcufates the ks,, :-s.iues (the concentration of drug required to displace
sljci of the iabelled ligand from the receptor sites) and
the slope factor (analogous to the hiti coefficient1
through an iterative curve-fitting progrztm (mcpherson.
1983).

ferent, depending on the amine receptor type affected.
for example, some ergot drugs are the most potent
displacers of [‘hlspiroperidol binding at dopamine receptors, while other ergots are most potent at serotonin receptors or cy-adrenoceptors (hruska and silbergeld, 1981).
our present findings are the first demonstration
that dihydrogenated ergot compounds potently affect
the gaba, receptor-coupled cl- ionophore labelled
with e3h]tbob. it should be emphasized
that
gabaergic facilitating ligands and gaba itself displace bound [ “hitbob with micromolar potencies.
there are, however, differences between the potency
of the three ergot compounds tested to displace
[3h]tbob binding to the gaba,
receptor from
mouse brain membranes. the most potent inhibitor of
[3h]tbob binding was dihydroergotoxine, with its ic,,,
value being even lower than that of gaba, while the
two other ergot compounds, dihydroergosine and dihydroergotamine, were approximately 30 times less potent. however, even the potency of these two ergot
derivates to displace [3h]tbob was only 3-4 times
lower than that recently described for diazepam and
certain barbiturates (van rijn et al., 1990). the ability
of gaba to displace [3h]tbob binding, as judged
from its ic,, value, was similar to that reported by
other authors (lawrence et al., 1985; van rijn et al.,
1990).
the curve-fitting analyses of our binding data did
not show a simple non-cooperative pattern of inhibition of [“h]tbob binding by the ergot compounds
used. while the slope factor for gaba approached 1.
indicating that gaba was bound to a single population of receptors, i.e. low-affinity binding sites which
are coupled to and operate the chloride channel, the
slopes for dihydrogenated ergot compounds were different, although not in the same direction. the slope
factor for dihydroergotoxine was considerably greater
than unity, which is commonly taken as evidence for
positive cooperativity among several binding sites. the
slope factor for dihydroergosine
and dihydroergotamine, lower than 0.5, might suggest negatively cooperative interactions, i.e. the existence of multiple binding sites.
at this time, the pharmacological significance of the
action of dihydrogenated ergot compounds at the henzodiazepine/gaba
receptor-associated
cl- iono-

phore is still not clear. at least one of these compounds, dihydroergosine, appears to have anticonvulsant properties in mice (peris
and mhnev, 1990;
perieid and tvrdeit, 1990), potent anxiolytic effects in
rats and enhancing effects on [‘h]muscimol binding in
the human brain post-mortem (peris
and tvrdeid,
submitted). further experiments are needed to explain
the nature of the effects of these ergot compounds at
the gaba, receptor level.
in conclusion, the present findings indicate that
dihydrogenated ergot drugs have a very high binding
activity at the brain gaba, receptor-associated clionophore labelled with [‘hitbob. the findings of
the present study should be taken into account when
these drugs are used in the clinic.
