1 the characteristic changes seen in asthma are widely regarded as being caused by
local mediator release in the airways, with histamine the first putative mediator in
asthma to be identified.
2 we performed a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled crossover trial of
the effect of 4 weeks treatment with terfenadine 120 mg twice daily in chronic
severe asthma.
3 forty-two subjects (20 male and 22 female) completed the 10 week study.
4 terfenadine had no significant treatment effect on the primary efficacy variables
measured. mean (95% ci) measurements for terfenadine vs placebo treatment
periods were 1.5 vs 1.5 (-0.3, 0.3) 1 for fev1, 259 vs 260 (-42, 40) 1 min-' for
morning pef and 0.8 vs 0.8 (-0.3, 0.3) for global symptom scores.
5 bronchodilator use and sleep disturbance, the secondary efficacy variables
studied, showed an improvement during terfenadine treatment but this only
reached statistical significance for the number of times subjects awoke from sleep
(p

=

0.04).

6 there was a similar frequency of minor adverse effects reported during placebo
(13.6%) and terfenadine (16.7%) treatments.
7 addition of the potent and specific histamine hi-receptor antagonist terfenadine to
maintainance asthma treatment had no significant therapeutic benefit in this group
of chronic severe asthmatics.

introduction

the airway obstruction and associated inflammatory
changes seen in asthma are widely accepted to occur
in response to the local release of mediators from
inflammatory cells in close proximity to the airways
[1]. the first of these mediators identified was histamine, isolated at the beginning of the century [2] and
subsequently found to cause bronchoconstriction in
asthmatics [3]. the role of histamine in allergic
diseases resulted in the successful search for pharmacological antagonists [4]. more potent and specific
histamine hi-receptor antagonists have since been
developed [5] which overcome the dose-limiting
adverse effects, particularly sedation [6].
on the assumption that histamine was a major

mediator in asthma the advent of receptor antagonists
provoked interest in their use as potential therapeutic
agents in this disease. early studies [7] failed to
demonstrate any therapeutic efficacy but the development of antihistamines with increased efficacy in the
asthmatic airways [8] makes reassessment of their role
as therapeutic agents timely. terfenadine is one such
drug, a piperidine antihistamine [9] manufactured by
structural modification of the butyrophenone haloperidol [10]. it is highly specific for the hi-receptor
both in vitro [5] and in vivo [11] with no sedative
effects [12]. we performed a study to assess the
effect of terfenadine in subjects with chronic severe
asthma.

methods

subjects
forty-nine subjects, 21 male and 28 female, with a >2
year history of dyspnoea and wheeze were recruited
for the study. the mean age was 50 (range 25-60)
years and 57% were atopic, defined as a 2 2 mm wheal
response to at least two from a range of common allergens including dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, cat
dander, mixed grass pollens, dog dander and feathers.
the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fevi) was
1.47 (s.d. 0.48) 1, representing 53 (s.d. 17)% of predicted values. all subjects had a .15% increase in
fevy following inhaled 02-adrenoceptor agonist bronchodilator. to allow any effect of additional antihistamine treatment to be detected only subjects with
poorly controlled asthma, defined as .1 episode of
nocturnal asthma per week and/or daytime asthma
symptoms preventing work .1 day per month, were
included. in addition to inhaled p2-adrenoceptor
agonist bronchodilators 94% of subjects were taking
regular inhaled corticosteroids and 41% oral xanthines. with the exception of inhaled bronchodilators,
pre-entry asthma treatment was continued at the same
dose throughout the study period. subjects gave
written informed consent and the study was approved
by the southampton university and hospitals ethics
committee.

measurement of efficacy variables
three primary efficacy variables were assessed throughout the study period. the fevy was measured at the
completion of each phase, i.e. the end of weeks 1, 5, 6
and 10. measurement of fevy was made using a dry
bellows spirometer (vitalograph, buckingham, uk)
with the best of three attempts at each time point used
for analysis. secondly, the peak expiratory flow (pef)
was measured twice daily using a mini wright peak
flow meter (clement clarke international, harlow,
essex, uk). subjects recorded their pef at standard
times in the morning and evening, whenever possible
having avoided bronchodilator use for the preceding
4 h. finally, subjects were asked to grade their symptoms of wheeze, breathlessness, cough and activity
limitation due to asthma on a scale 0-4 for each 24 h
period, thus providing a subjective symptom score.
the secondary efficacy variables assessed were daily
bronchodilator usage, quantified as puffs of aerosol
used over the 24 h period and sleep disturbance. sleep
disturbance was quantified by the number of times
subjects woke due to asthma and the number of minutes of sleep lost overnight.

study design
the study design was that of a double-blind, two
group, two treatment period, crossover trial comparing terfenadine with matched placebo. subjects
were randomly allocated to treatment groups which
determined the order in which the study drugs
were presented. one week prior to each treatment
period subjects received placebo in a single-blind

fashion, the 10-week study being divided into four
phases:
week 1:
run-in, subjects receiving placebo treatment in a single-blind fashion.
weeks 2-5: first active treatment, subjects receiving
terfenadine or matched placebo in a
double-blind fashion.
washout, subjects receiving placebo
week 6:
treatment in a single-blind fashion.
weeks 7-10: second active treatment, subjects receiving terfenadine or matched placebo in a
double-blind fashion.
medications were administered as single tablets containing terfenadine 120 mg or matched placebo taken
twice daily. at the conclusion of each phase any
unused tablets were collected and compliance determined. non-compliance, defined as <50% return,
resulted in withdrawal from the study.
data analyses

for pef, the mean value of the morning and evening
measurements for each phase was calculated and used
for statistical analysis. the symptoms, wheeze, breathlessness, cough and activity limitation were each
graded 0-4 and their mean calculated. this gave a
'global' score of asthma symptoms for each study day
and the mean value for each phase was then used for
statistical analysis. statistical comparisons of fevy,
pef and global symptom scores were made by analysis of variance (anova) taking into account patient,
treatment, period and sequence variables. for each
secondary efficacy variable the daily mean score was
calculated for terfenadine and placebo treatment periods and the level for each treatment period categorised
(table 1). the levels during terfenadine and placebo
treatments were then compared by wilcoxon's signed
rank test. statistical significance was set at the 5%
level. the a priori power calculations for the study,
based on measurement of the fev1 and assuming a
standard deviation of 0.5 1, indicated the study sample
to be sufficient size to detect a 15% change in fev1
with an error level (3) of 0.13.

period and the remaining two during the first treatment
phase. five subjects withdrew for personal reasons and
the remaining two discontinued the trial medication
after developing vomiting and vertigo respectively.
thus analysis is restricted to 42 subjects, 20 male and
22 female, completing all phases of the study. five
patients (two during terfenadine treatment and three
during placebo) required additional asthma treatments
during the study period, all receiving short courses of
oral corticosteroids. measurement of compliance with
treatment other than the study medication was not
undertaken. there were no withdrawals from the study
due to non-compliance with the study medication. the
two treatment groups, placebo followed by terfenadine
and terfenadine followed by placebo, were comparable
in terms of sex ratio, age, lung function measurements
and symptom scores (table 2). there was no difference between run-in and washout periods for the primary efficacy variables nor was there any evidence of
an order effect.
between treatment analysis of the primary efficacy
variables (table 3) showed no significant difference
between placebo and terfenadine treatment phases.
the mean fevy measured after 4 weeks of treatment
was identical for terfenadine and placebo treatments.
similarly, the mean daily global symptom score during
terfenadine and placebo treatment periods was the
same. while there was a minor difference between
morning and evening peak flow measurements, this

673

represents the normal variability seen in asthma.
secondary efficacy variables showed some improvement during terfenadine treatment when compared
with placebo (table 3), although this difference only
reached statistical significance for the number of times
subjects woke from sleep at night (p = 0.04). there
was a similar frequency of adverse effects reported
during placebo (13.6%) and terfenadine treatment
phases (16.7%), the most commonly reported effects
being a dry mouth, fatigue and drowsiness.

discussion
the aim of this study was to assess the role of histamine hi-receptor blockade in subjects with chronic
asthma. to this end we performed a double-blind randomised comparison of the potent and selective hlreceptor antagonist terfenadine with placebo. we did
not find any objective benefit for terfenadine over
placebo. terfenadine was administered at a dose of
240 mg day-' to provide good protection against histamine in the airways [13]. at the time of the study the
dose of 240 mg day-' utilised was felt to be safe,
although there have been subsequent reports of torsade de pointes occurring at lower doses [14]. this
cardiotoxicity has usually occurred in the presence of
predisposing factors now well-recognised, such as
hypokalaemia, or where the hepatic metabolism of terfenadine may be impaired by liver disease or the
concurrent administration of other drugs such as ketoconazole. no major adverse effects occurred during
the study and the frequency of minor adverse effects
was similar for terfenadine and placebo.
all efficacy variables were similar for run-in and
wash-out periods, implying any differences observed
during treatment are likely to result from the effect of
terfenadine rather than confounding variables. active
treatment with terfenadine was primarily assessed by
measurement of airflow (fevy and pef) and scoring
of asthma related symptoms. no primary outcome
measure showed a significant effect for terfenadine
over matched placebo. secondary assessment by sleep
disturbance and bronchodilator use indicated a trend
towards better control during terfenadine, although
this reached statistical significance for only one outcome measure. we feel the objective measurements of
the pef and fevy are the most reliable indicators of a
treatment effect, although the possibility of a type ii
error cannot be excluded. the confidence intervals
between treatments compared with baseline measurements suggests that if this were the case the benefit
from terfenadine is unlikely to exceed 20% for fevy
and 16% for pef. we feel that this, together with the
similarity in mean values for all variables makes it
unlikely terfenadine provides a clinically important
effect in this type of asthmatic subject.
although the role of histamine in asthma has yet to
be clearly defined, there is strong evidence implicating
it during the early bronchoconstrictor response to
inhaled allergen. this comes from the increase in
plasma histamine concentrations coincident with the
development of airflow obstruction [15] and the ability

of hi-receptor antagonists to attenuate the airflow
obstruction [16]. this suggests that hi-receptor blockade could be therapeutically effective against the clinical correlate of acute allergen exposure as seen during
the pollen season. clinical trials have confirmed this,
showing terfenadine [17] and cetirizine [18] to be
effective treatment for grass pollen asthma. despite
hi-receptor blockade providing good control of symptoms the beneficial effects on airflow measurements
were not as impressive.
the contribution of histamine to the late bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled allergen in asthmatic subjects is less established. the initial finding of
increased plasma histamine concentrations [19] has
not been confirmed more recently [20], nor were
coincident changes in urinary histamine metabolites
found [21]. these variable findings are in keeping
with studies of hi-receptor blockade. neither terfenadine [22] or loratadine [23] were found to affect the
late bronchoconstriction significantly, although rafferty [20] found azelastine to provide some protection
in a subgroup of five dual responders. this was initially explained by the additional actions of azelastine
above its hi-receptor antagonism, but the effect has
not been confirmed in a more recent study [24].
in addition to protecting against the bronchoconstrictor effect of inhaled allergen, antihistamines have
been shown to cause bronchodilatation in asthmatic
subjects following single [13] or repeated administra-

tion [25]. it is difficult to explain the absence of a
bronchodilator effect in our study, but may reflect the
type of asthmatic subjects enrolled. over recent years
attention has been focussed on the inflammatory component of the asthma process [26], particularly by
studies using fibreoptic bronchoscopy [27]. accompanying the cellular infiltrate, even in mild asthmatics,
is the deposition of collagen in the epithelial basement
membrane [28]. with time the ability of the asthmatic
airways to change calibre may be limited by collagen
deposition and subsequent fibrosis around the bronchi.
the relatively fixed airway narrowing may limit bronchodilatation, such that maximal airway calibre is
achieved by traditional bronchodilators even in the
presence of ongoing mediator release. alternatively
histamine and mast cells may play a minor role in this
type of asthmatic subject, with other mediators such as
leukotriene d4 released from eosinophils playing the
dominant role.
in conclusion, the results of this study suggest that
the addition of a potent and specific hi-receptor antagonist terfenadine does not confer any therapeutic benefit to the maintainance treatment of chronic severe
asthmatics. thus, it seems unlikely histamine is an
important mediator contributing to airway narrowing
in chronic severe asthma.
we are grateful to marion merrell dow for funding the
