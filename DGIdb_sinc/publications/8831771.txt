in this sar study the bioisosteric potential of diazines in the field of combined antithrombotic
thromboxane a2 synthetase inhibitors and receptor antagonists was investigated. in this
context, two series of (e)- and (z)-omega-[[(aryldiazinylmethylene)amino]oxy]alkanoic acids were
synthesized of which pentanoic acid derivatives with a 2-pyrazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, or 5-pyrimidinyl group were found to exhibit this dual activity, while 4-pyrimidinyl as well as 3-pyridazinyl
analogues showed only receptor antagonistic activity and 2-pyrimidinyl congeners were inactive.
in the series of diazine analogues of  xxxd3115xxx  (1), replacement of the 3-pyridyl group by a
2-pyrazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, or 5-pyrimidinyl moiety led to compounds that inhibit thromboxane
a2 synthetase in gel-filtered human platelets comparable to 1 (ic50 of 0.006, 0.016, and 0.039
µm, respectively, versus 0.007 µm). radioligand-binding studies with [3h]sq 29,548 in washed
human platelets revealed that these diazine analogues block the  xxxg2253xxx  with
an ic50 of 11, 6.0, and 1.5 µm, respectively. this compares well with the ic50 ) 1.7 µm of 1.
finally, testing of inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich
plasma with 2-pyrazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, or 5-pyrimidinyl congeners of  xxxd3115xxx  indicated that
these heteroaromatic moieties may serve as bioisosteric substitutes of a 3-pyridyl group in
dual-acting antiplatelet agents.
one of the metabolic pathways of  xxxd208xxx  is
initiated in human blood platelets by the enzyme
cyclooxygenase leading to the formation of an unstable
cyclic endoperoxide, prostaglandin h2 (pgh2). once
produced inside platelets, pgh2 is converted by the
enzyme thromboxane synthetase ( xxxg2254xxx ) to thromboxane
a2 (txa2),1 a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet-aggregating agent. txa2 migrates to the cell surface and
binds to the txa2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor
(r-receptor2) thereby initiating a cascade of events that
leads to platelet aggregation.
many studies provide evidence that txa2 is involved
in the pathogenesis of thrombotic/vasoocclusive disorders.3 first attempts to interfere with the formation
and pathological action of txa2 led to the development
of compounds inhibiting the key enzyme of txa2 formation, namely  xxxg2254xxx . however, most thromboxane synthetase inhibitors (txsi) proved to be poor antiplatelet
agents due to the fact that inhibition of  xxxg2254xxx  leads to an
accumulation of pgh2, which may also bind to the
txa2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor mimicking
the prothrombotic effects of txa2.3 this lack of efficacy
of txsis could be overcome by using them in combination with a  xxxg2253xxx  antagonist (txra).4
one of the first antiplatelet agents identified and
developed as a combined txsi and txra is  xxxd3115xxx  (1,
figure 1).5 it is a highly potent, selective, and long† dedicated with best personal wishes to prof. dr. ernst mutschler
on the occasion of his 65th birthday.

acting txsi (ic50 ) 6 × 10-9m),6 but only a weakly
active txra (ic50 ) 1.7 × 10-6 m).7 during the last
decade, much effort has been devoted to structural
modifications within the class of combined txsi/txra
with the objective to obtain antiplatelet agents exhibiting both activities equipotently in a nanomolar or subnanomolar range. a large number of these compounds
are derived from  xxxd3115xxx , thus containing a 3-pyridyl
system and a carboxyalkyl chain as characteristic
moieties (for a review see ref 8). for both txsi and
txra activity, a distance of 8.5-10 å between the
carbon atom of the carboxylic group and the sp2hybridized nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring is essential.9
besides the large number of dual active 3-pyridyl
derivatives, only a few examples of combined txsi/txra
containing other n-heteroaromatic rings are described
in the literature, e.g., as 1-imidazolyl-derived compounds.10
in continuation of our ongoing investigations of the
bioisosteric potential of diazines, we now became interested in two series of diaza analogues of  xxxd3115xxx , both
derived from diazinyl phenyl ketones (2-7) or diazinyl
3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl ketones (8-13) (see figure 2).

considering the different positions of the nitrogen atoms
in the diazine systems employed, we envisaged elongation and shortening, respectively, of the omega-carboxyalkyl
side chain by one methylene group compared to the lead
compound  xxxd3115xxx  in order to obtain compounds covering the optimal distance range 8.5-10 å between an
sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom of the diazine systems and
the carbon atom of the carboxylic group. here we report
on the synthesis of these novel compounds (21-25), on

the compounds listed in tables 1 and 2 were prepared
as depicted in scheme 1; for the synthesis of the starting
aryl diazinyl ketones 2-13, see ref 11. in general,
preparation of the target (e)- and (z)-omega-[[(aryldiazinylmethylene)amino]oxy]alkanoic acids 21-25 was carried
out starting from mixtures of (e)- and (z)-aryl diazinyl
ketoximes 14 and 15 which were prepared by reaction
of ketones 2-13 with hydroxylamine according to ref
11. alkylation of the oximes 14 and 15 with appropriate
ethyl omega-bromoalkanoates (scheme 1) yielded mixtures
of (e)- and (z)-ketoxime ethers 16a,b, 17a,b, 18a,b,
16d-f, 17d-f, 18d-f, 19b, 20b, 19d-f, and 20d-f
(method a). chromatographic separation then led to
pure (e)- and (z)-isomers which finally gave the target
free carboxylic acids 21a,b, 22a,b, 23a,b, 21d-f, 22df, 23d-f, 24b, 25b, 24d-f, and 25d-f in isomerically
pure form upon alkaline hydrolysis.

since pure (e)-ketoxime e-14c11 could be obtained
easily by fractional crystallization, pure (e)-ketoxime
ethers e-16c, e-17c, and e-18c became available by
alkylation of e-14c with the appropriate ethyl omega-bromoalkanoates. alkaline hydrolysis finally gave isomerically pure acids e-21c, e-22c, and e-23c.
for a more convenient synthesis of compounds 16c20c, 19a, and 20a ethyl omega-(aminooxy)alkanoates 2931 were reacted with ketones 4, 8, and 10. this
approach (method b) gave higher yields than the
reaction sequence according to method a. the required
educts 29-31 were prepared via a slight modification
of a two-step procedure previously described for the
preparation of ethyl (aminooxy)acetate12 consisting of
alkylation of n-hydroxyphthalimide with ethyl omega-bromoalkanoates and subsequent hydrazinolysis (scheme 2).
since 19a and 20a could not be separated by column
chromatography or crystallization, these esters were
hydrolyzed to give (e) and (z) mixtures of the free
carboxylic acids 24a and 25a, the isomer ratio of which
was established by 1h-nmr spectroscopy.
the configuration of the target compounds 21-25 was
assigned mainly by 1h-nmr spectroscopy considering
the chemical shifts observed for the heteroaromatic
protons adjacent to the cn double bond.15 by comparison of these chemical shift patterns with those of the
corresponding (e)- and (z)-ketoximes 14 and 15 (the
configurational assignment of which had been carried
out previously11 by homonuclear noe difference spectroscopy as well as 13c-nmr spectroscopy), unequivocal
assignment of the stereochemistry was possible for all

new compounds. a detailed presentation of these
spectroscopic investigations has been published recently.13,14
results and discussion
the compounds listed in tables 1 and 2 were initially
tested for in vitro inhibition of collagen-induced platelet
aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma (prp). the
most potent compounds out of this first test series, all
(e)- and (z)-aza- xxxd3115xxx  derivatives 24 and congeners
thereof lacking of the trifluoromethyl group (22), were
further tested in the following two assays: (a) displacement of the high-affinity radiolabeled ligand [3h]sq
29,548 from the pgh2/ xxxg2253xxx  on human gelfiltered platelets and (b) inhibition of txb2 formation
by human gel-filtered platelets incubated with [14c] xxxd208xxx .
the test results are listed as ic50/ec50 values in
tables 1 and 2. formally, the six possible position
isomers of the three diazine rings can be divided into
two groups: the first group of ring systems represents “aza 3-pyridyl” moieties with an additional nitrogen atom in position 2 (3-pyridazinyl system), 4 (4pyridazinyl system), 5 (5-pyrimidinyl system), or 6 (2pyrazinyl system). the second group consists of two
ring systems, i.e., the 2-pyrimidinyl and the 4-pyrimidinyl system, which lack of a nitrogen atom in position
3 related to the oxime ether side chain.
starting with the oxime ethers 21-23 derived from
the parent diazinyl phenyl ketones 2-7, we first examined the influence of the presence of different diazine

scheme 1a

position 2 (compounds 22a) also leads to txsi inactive
compounds. in contrast, formal incorporation of the
additional nitrogen atom into position 4 (4-pyridazinyl
derivative e-22b) results in a compound with slight
txsi activity (ic50 of 260 nm). an additional nitrogen
atom in position 5 or 6 (5-pyrimidinyl or 2-pyrazinyl
derivatives) results in higher txsi activity: the pentanoic acid derivatives e-22e and e- xxxd1552xxx  inhibit  xxxg2254xxx  with
ic50 values of 75 and 79 nm, respectively. the (z)isomers turned out to be much less potent. thus, the
3-pyridyl moiety in  xxxd3115xxx -type compounds can be
replaced only by 4-pyridazinyl, 5-pyrimidinyl, or 2-pyrazinyl moieties without complete loss of txsi activity. in
this series elongation of the side chain does not lead to
compounds with enhanced txsi activity.
tests of compounds 22a-f, 23b, 23d, and z-23e with
regard to their thromboxane receptor antagonism gave
the following results: a 2-pyrimidinyl system is also
deleterious for txra activity, whereas the 4-pyrimidinyl-derived acids 22d and 23d exhibit receptor antagonistic activity in the range 5.0-30 µm. employment of a “4-, 5-, or 6-aza-3-pyridyl” system is associated
with txra activity in a similar range (ic50 7.1-104
µm), while 3-pyridazinyl derived acids 22a exhibit only
low txra activity (ic50 71 and 104 µm, respectively).
it should be noted that the configuration at the cn
double bond does not influence txra activity as significantly as observed in the assay for txsi activity. nor
did we find in this series marked differences in activity
between pentanoic and hexanoic acid derivatives.
in a further step of our study, we prepared and tested
compounds 24 and 25 as diazine analogues of  xxxd3115xxx .
since we had found within the series of compounds 2123 that butanoic acids were more or less inactive as
inhibitors of human platelet aggregation, we now limited the variation of the length of the side chain to
pentanoic and hexanoic acid derivatives.
here, we observed structure-activity relationships
similar to those we had found within the series of
compounds 21-23: the 4-pyridazinyl analogue of
 xxxd3115xxx , e-24b exhibits comparable antiaggregatory
activity (ec50 ) 52 µm) since replacement of the
3-pyridyl moiety in 1 by the 4-pyridazinyl system does
not significantly affect both txsi and txra activity. the
corresponding (z)-isomer (z-24b) is also active as an
antiplatelet compound, but its activity results mainly
from its micromolar txra activity (ic50 ) 1.8 µm), since
txsi activity is strongly reduced due to (z) configuration. elongation of the carboxyalkyl side chain by one
methylene group (e-25b and z-25b) reduces both txsi
and txra activity. the 3-pyridazinyl analogues e/z24a which were tested as a 2:1 mixture of (e)- and (z)isomers, exhibited no txsi and low txra activity.
replacement of the 3-pyridyl moiety in 1 by a 2-pyrimidinyl system is also deleterious for both activities and
results in a low antiplatelet activity. in contrast,
incorporation of a 4-pyrimidinyl system (e-24d and
z-24d) leads to a receptor antagonistic activity similar
to that of 1, which is not affected by elongation of the
side chain, but again no txsi activity at all could be
detected. like the 4-pyridazinyl analogues, also 5-pyrimidinyl and 2-pyrazinyl congeners (e-24e and e-24f)
exhibit txsi activity in the nanomolar range. again,
txsi activity is significantly reduced upon change from
(e) to (z) configuration at the cn double bond, while

systems on platelet antiaggregatory activity. all aza
3-pyridyl pentanoic acid derivatives e-22a,b,e,f inhibit
collagen-induced platelet aggregation with ec50 values
in the range ∼90-300 µm. in the second group, only
the 4-pyrimidinyl derivative e-22d exhibits platelet
antiaggregatory activity comparable to that of the
analogues of the first group. butanoic acids 21 turned
out to be less potent while some hexanoic acids 23
showed higher antiplatelet activity (see table 1). the
most potent representative within this series (ec50 )
59 µm) is compound e-23b. it is of interest to note that
similar trends with regard to the length of the side chain
and the nature of the diazine system are observed also
with (z) configurated compounds z-21, z-22, and z-23.
in order to gain insight into the bioisosteric potential
of the six isomeric diazine systems with regard to
thromboxane synthetase inhibition and receptor antagonism, the appropriate assays with selected compounds, as mentioned above, were performed. the 2or the 4-pyrimidinyl-derived compounds 22c and 22d
did not show any txsi activity. within the group of
aza-3-pyridyl analogues, the second nitrogen atom in

txra activity is 10-fold higher in (z)-isomers. in fact,
the most potent txra in this series is the 5-pyrimidinyl
derived pentanoic acid z-24e (ic50 ) 0.36 µm), but its
txsi activity is in the mixeomolar range due to the (z)
configuration. on the other hand, the most potent txsi
of the  xxxd3115xxx  analogues (ic50 ) 6.0 nm), the 2-pyrazinyl derivative e-24f, exhibits a 10-fold lower txra
activity compared to that of 1.

conclusion
on the basis the structure-activity relationships
observed in this study, it turned out that only the
2-pyrazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, and 5-pyrimidinyl systems
are appropriate bioisosteric moieties for the 3-pyridyl
system in the dual active platelet antiaggregatory
compound  xxxd3115xxx . while 2-pyrimidinyl analogues
showed neither txsi nor significant txra activity and
3-pyridazinyl as well as 4-pyrimidinyl congeners were
only active as txra, the 2-pyrazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, and
5-pyrimidinyl analogues exhibit a dual activity comparable to that of  xxxd3115xxx . thus, it might be of interest
to utilize the bioisosteric potential of the latter heteroaryl groups for further developments of antiplatelet
compounds with combined txsi/txra activity.

collagen-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. blood
was obtained from healthy volunteers who had refrained from
taking any medication for at least 14 days prior to venipuncture. the blood was mixed with trisodium citrate solution
(3.8% w/v) at ratio of 9:1. platelet-rich plasma (prp) and
platelet-poor plasma (ppp) were obtained from the blood by
centrifugation (rotixa ks, hettich) at 1000 rpm for 10 min at
10 °c and 4000 rpm for 10 min  xxxd1891xxx  °c, respectively. prp
was then adjusted to a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml
(prp 250). platelet aggregation tests were performed in a two-

channel aggregometer (labor aggregometer, frg) and recorded on two recorders (lkb clinicon 2066a, goerz, au) at
a paper speed of 0.5 mm/s.
prp 250 (400 µl) and 50 µl of a solution of the test
compound or vehicle solution (8 g/l nacl, 200 mg/l kcl, 1g/l
nahco3, 50 mg/l nah2po4‚h2o, 306 mg/l cacl2‚2h2o, 203
mg/l mgcl2‚6h2o) were incubated 10 min at room temperature followed by 5 min at 37 °c before addition of collagen (20
µl; 0.53 µg/ml final concentration). after the addition of
collagen, the optical density of the stirred prp 250 (500 units/
min) was recorded for 4 min. all experiments were performed
at least as duplicates. values were expressed as percent
inhibition of aggregation, which represented the percentage
of light transmission standardized to prp 250 and ppp
samples, yielding 0% and 100% light transmission, respectively. the ec50, i.e., the concentration of the test compound
required for half the maximal inhibition of collagen-induced
platelet aggregation, was calculated from the concentration
versus inhibition of aggregation curve.
thromboxane synthetase inhibition. inhibition of
txb2 formation by human gel-filtered platelets incubated with
[14c] xxxd208xxx  was measured as described before.7 this
test procedure allowed the quantification of free aa, 12hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-hete); 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (hht); prostaglandins d2, e2, and  xxxg746xxx ; and
thromboxane b2 (txb2). thromboxane synthetase inhibition
is characterized by a decrease in txb2 and a corresponding
increase in the “classical” prostaglandins. cyclooxygenase
inhibition is seen by a decrease of andoperoxide-derived
products and an increase in 12-hete.
thromboxane receptor antagonism. the binding of
the test compounds was determined by measuring the displacement of the high-affinity ligand [3h]sq 29,548 according
to ref 7. nonspecific binding was determined by adding u
46,619 (30 µm final concentration), replacing the test compound. ic50 values listed in tables 1 and 2 represent the
concentration of test compound causing 50% displacement of
[3h]sq 29,548.
