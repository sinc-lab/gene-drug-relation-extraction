■ abstract the mechanisms of general anesthesia in the central nervous system
are finally yielding to molecular examination. as a result of research during the past
several decades, a group of ligand-gated ion channels have emerged as plausible targets for general anesthetics. molecular biology techniques have greatly accelerated
attempts to classify ligand-gated ion channel sensitivity to general anesthetics, and
have identified the sites of receptor subunits critical for anesthetic modulation using
chimeric and mutated receptors. the experimental data have facilitated the construction
of tenable molecular models for anesthetic binding sites, which in turn allows structural
predictions to be tested. in vivo significance of a putative anesthetic target can now
be examined by targeted gene manipulations in mice. in this review, we summarize
from a molecular perspective recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of
action of general anesthetics on ligand-gated ion channels.

introduction
general anesthetics are some of the most widely used and important therapeutic
agents. however, despite over a century of research, the molecular mechanisms
of general anesthesia in the central nervous system remain elusive. as a result of
research during the past several decades, there has been a transition from initial
notions of nonspecific actions of general anesthetics on membrane lipids to the

belief that their primary sites of action are neuronal proteins. although many neuronal proteins can be affected by general anesthetics, a consensus has emerged that
a group of ligand-gated ion channels, which are important for neuronal function,
are particularly sensitive to general anesthetics (1–4). this review is restricted to
discussion of ligand-gated ion channels.1
ligand-gated ion channels include gamma - xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa),
glycine, nicotinic acetylcholine (nach), and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-ht3) receptors, along with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx 
(ampa)-, kainate-, and n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)–selective glutamate receptors. gabaa, glycine, nach, and 5-ht3 receptors form part of an evolutionarily related ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily (5), whereas glutamate
receptors are thought to belong to a distinct ion channel class. members of a
ligand-gated ion channel superfamily have a basic transmembrane topology, with
a large n-terminal extracellular domain, four putative transmembrane segments
(tm1–tm4), a heterogeneous intracellular loop between  xxxg2318xxx  and tm4, and a
short extracellular c-terminal domain. residues within the extracellular domain
form the agonist-binding domain, whereas amino acid residues within tm2 line
the ion channel pore. native receptors are composed of pentameric arrangements of
individual receptor subunits (3). on the other hand, glutamate receptors have three
transmembrane segments (m1, m3, and m4) plus a cytoplasm-facing re-entrant
membrane loop (m2) that lines the ion channel pore. thus, the n-terminal domain
is located extracellularly, and the c-terminal domain, intracellularly. subunit stoichiometry of native glutamate receptors is controversial between tetrameric and
pentameric structures (6).
general anesthesia is a behavioral state that requires critical degrees of immobility, amnesia, hypnosis/unconsciousness, analgesia, and muscle relaxation.
thus, key questions include the following:
1. sensitivity: which ligand-gated ion channels are sufficiently sensitive to
clinically relevant concentrations of general anesthetics? how important is
subunit composition for anesthetic sensitivity?
2. mechanism: what is the molecular mechanism by which general
anesthetics affect the function of ligand-gated ion channels?
3. in vivo importance: which ligand-gated ion channels determine specific
behavioral actions of general anesthetics? is the responsible target
common to a wide variety of general anesthetics or specific for certain
agents?

relevant anesthetic concentrations
for a target to have relevance to anesthesia, it must be sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anesthetics. minimum alveolar concentration (mac) conventionally refers to the concentration of inhaled anesthetic that produces immobility,
the lack of movement in response to a noxious stimulus, in 50% of subjects studied
(7). the use of immobility as an anesthetic endpoint is helpful in that, for most general anesthetics, anesthetic concentrations two- to fourfold above the mac cause
deleterious side effects (1). thus, anesthetic concentrations severalfold greater than
the mac define the upper boundary of the concentration range that is clinically
relevant.
the hill coefficient value of concentration-effect relationships for inhaled anesthetic mac is generally large—6 to 20 (8). some would argue that this is related
to anesthetic mechanisms (9), but others argue that the steepness results from small
population variations (8). the important point we have to keep in mind, however,
is the categorical (move/no move) nature of the mac measurement. specifically,
the slope of dose-response curves becomes steep when the data are categorically
processed. the slope of categorical responses for each individual does not depend
on the hill value of the underlying dose-response relationship, but depends on the
interval of concentrations examined, and it could be infinitely steep (figure 1). this
steep slope for the individual categorical response would be a basis of the steep
slope of a population dose-response relationship (for mac determination). thus,
the steep slope of mac response may not necessarily be related to mechanisms of
anesthetic actions on targets.
the issue of clinically relevant concentrations for intravenous anesthetics is considerably more complicated than that for volatile anesthetics because of limited
pharmacokinetic data adequately collected for a defined endpoint of anesthesia
and because of the difficulty in ascertaining steady-state free aqueous anesthetic
concentrations in the brain (1). relevant anesthetic concentrations of propofol and
barbiturates have been carefully estimated (1). as for other intravenous anesthetics, plausible concentrations for producing immobility estimated from available
data are shown by krasowski and harrison (3).

general anesthetic actions on recombinant
ligand-gated ion channels
the advent of cloning and expression techniques has greatly accelerated and facilitated attempts to classify ligand-gated ion channel sensitivity to general anesthetics. molecular biology techniques have the advantage of identifying the sites of
receptor subunits critical for anesthetic modulation. because sensitivity to general
anesthetics varies considerably, sometimes even among closely related receptors,

the original slope of isoflurane dose-inhibition curves.

chimeric receptors can be used to delimit regions of subunits essential for anesthetic
actions, after which site-directed mutagenesis can be used to pinpoint the critical
residues.

on ligand-gated ion channels as follows. (a) volatile anesthetics show prominent
potentiation of gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  function, and strong inhibition of
neuronal nach receptors. (b) barbiturates markedly potentiate gabaa receptors and inhibit nach, ampa, and kainate receptors. (c) propofol and etomidate
are relatively selective for gabaa receptors. (d ) steroid anesthetics potentiate
gabaa receptors and inhibit neuronal nach receptors. (e) ketamine does not
affect gabaa receptors but inhibits nmda receptors potently and neuronal
nach receptors with lower potency. thus, it is only gabaa receptors that are
sensitive to every volatile and intravenous anesthetic (except ketamine) at clinically
relevant concentrations.
differences in anesthetic sensitivity between homologous subunits allow the
following conclusions: (a) enhancement of gabaa receptor function by volatile
anesthetics does not require any specific subunit and is similar for a wide variety of different subunit combinations, but gabac rho 1 receptors are inhibited
by volatile anesthetics (10). (b) etomidate sensitivity of gabaa receptors is
different between beta subunits, and receptors containing beta 2 or beta 3, but not beta 1, subunits are highly sensitive to etomidate (11, 12). (c) gabaa receptors are generally sensitive to intravenous anesthetics, whereas glycine receptors are much less
sensitive to intravenous anesthetics (13, 14). (d ) neuronal heteromeric nach receptors, especially those composed of beta 2 subunits, are very sensitive to volatile
anesthetics, whereas homomeric alpha 7 and muscle nach receptors are relatively
insensitive to volatile anesthetics (15–17). (e) ampa receptors ( xxxg952xxx –4 subunits) are slightly inhibited by volatile anesthetics, whereas kainate receptors
( xxxg958xxx –7 and ka-1,2 subunits) are potentiated by volatile anesthetics (18).
(f ) ampa receptors containing  xxxg953xxx  subunits are more sensitive to barbiturates than those without  xxxg953xxx  subunits (19). some critical amino acid residues
have been identified by using these differences in subunit sensitivity to anesthetics
(see below).

gaseous anesthetics
the anesthetic properties of gasses such as nitrous oxide and xenon have long been
central to molecular theories of anesthesia that seek to explain how these simple
and small molecules are able to produce anesthesia. recent studies suggest that
gabaa receptor currents are only weakly potentiated by nitrous oxide (20–22; but
see 23) and are little affected by xenon (22, 24, 25), which contrasts clearly with
volatile and intravenous anesthetics (table 3). glycine receptors are moderately
potentiated by nitrous oxide and xenon at clinical concentrations (22, 26), whereas
gabac rho 1 receptors are slightly inhibited by nitrous oxide (22). in contrast to
gabaa receptors, nitrous oxide and xenon have marked inhibitory effects on
nmda receptors (20–22, 24, 25). ampa and kainate receptors are also inhibited
by nitrous oxide, though by a smaller degree than nmda receptors (21, 22),
whereas they are little affected by xenon (24, 25). the  xxxg1116xxx  is slightly
inhibited by nitrous oxide, which is opposite to the effects of volatile anesthetics

and ethanol on this receptor (22). muscle alpha 1beta 1gamma delta nach receptors are inhibited by
nitrous oxide at clinical concentrations (27). neuronal nach receptors are inhibited by nitrous oxide and xenon, and sensitivity to gaseous anesthetics is different
between alpha 4beta 2 and alpha 4beta 4 receptors, with alpha 4beta 2 receptors being more sensitive than
alpha 4beta 4 receptors (22). thus, nitrous oxide and xenon display a similar spectrum of
receptor actions, but this spectrum is distinct from volatile and intravenous anesthetics. based on their anesthetic sensitivity, nmda receptors and nach receptors
composed of beta 2 subunits are considered to be potential targets for nitrous oxide
and xenon in the central nervous system.

molecular sites of action of anesthetics
critical sites for anesthetic actions
molecular biology techniques, such as construction of chimeric receptors and
single amino acid mutations, have considerably facilitated the identification of
regions/sites critical for anesthetic modulation. the use of a panel of glycine
alpha 1/gabac rho 1 chimeric receptors and extensive site-directed mutagenesis of
 xxxg904xxx  alpha 1 and gaba receptor alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and rho 1 subunits has
identified specific amino acid positions within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  that are critical
for potentiation of agonist-induced currents by volatile anesthetics and alcohols

(28–36). agonist potentiation by propofol is also affected by a point mutation
of these specific residues in tm2 (37) and  xxxg2318xxx  (31) of the gabaa receptor beta
subunits.
etomidate sensitivity of gabaa receptors is different between beta subunits, and
receptors containing beta 2 or beta 3, but not beta 1, subunits are highly sensitive to etomidate
(11, 12). using gabaa beta 1/beta 2 chimeric receptors and site-directed mutagenesis,
specific amino acid positions within tm2 of beta subunits, which correspond to
positions critical for volatile anesthetic and alcohol actions, are identified to be
important for etomidate actions on gabaa receptors (12, 38, 39).
pentobarbital sensitivity of gabaa receptors is reduced by a point mutation
of residues in tm2 (which correspond to positions critical for volatile anesthetic
actions) of the beta 3 subunit (37), and pentobarbital sensitivity is introduced into
gabac rho 1 receptors by single amino acid mutations of residues in tm2 (40)
and  xxxg2318xxx  (41), which also correspond to positions critical for volatile anesthetic
actions. a point mutation of residues in tm2 of the gabaa receptor beta 1 subunit
located three positions amino terminal of the critical site for volatile anesthetics
abolishes pentobarbital potentiation of gabaa receptors (42). conversion of a
conserved glycine residue at the entrance of tm1 of gabaa receptor beta 2 subunits
into phenylalanine (gabac rho 1 residue) decreases modulatory effects of pentobarbital, alphaxalone, etomidate, and propofol (43).
by examining glutamate  xxxg954xxx / xxxg959xxx  chimeric receptors and extensive point
mutations, a specific amino acid in segment m4 of  xxxg959xxx  kainate receptors is
identified to be critical for volatile anesthetic enhancement of kainate receptors
(44). sensitivity of ampa receptors to barbiturates is determined by an arginine
residue in channel-lining segment m2 of the  xxxg831xxx  ( xxxg953xxx ) subunit, which corresponds to amino acid residues determining ca2+ permeability of ampa receptors
(45, 46). ketamine sensitivity of nmda receptors is determined by the conserved asparagine residue in the channel-lining segment m2 of the epsilon2 (nr2b) and
zeta 1 (nr1) subunits, which constitutes the mg2+ block site of nmda receptors
(46–48). this position of the asparagine residue on nmda receptor subunits
corresponds to that of arginine of the  xxxg831xxx  ( xxxg953xxx ) subunit, which determines barbiturate sensitivity of ampa receptors.
point mutations of an amino acid residue in the middle of tm2 of muscle nach
receptor  xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg836xxx  subunits enhance sensitivity to volatile anesthetics (49, 50).
the sensitivity of nach receptors to blockade by volatile anesthetics increases
with increased hydrophobicity of this residue (49, 50).

binding or transduction?
as discussed above, site-directed mutagenesis has identified many single amino
acid mutations in receptor subunits that alter anesthetic modulation. the next
question of whether a key residue is involved in constituting a binding site for
anesthetics or in transducing the anesthetic actions is critical to understanding
molecular mechanisms of anesthetic actions. even for effects of mutation on

agonist binding to receptors, it is not easy to differentiate between effects on
binding and effects on the transductional process (51), and the same is true in
anesthetic binding. furthermore, general anesthetics have properties that limit the
utility of other experimental techniques. for example, radioligand-binding assay
with general anesthetics to ligand-gated ion channels has proven exceedingly difficult to demonstrate owing to low affinity, rapid kinetics, and high nonspecific
binding to neuronal membranes (2, 3, 52).
although limited progress has been made in developing anesthetic congeners
useful for photoaffinity labeling or other covalent modification of receptors (3),
recently a photoaffinity general anesthetic 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-n-pentyldiazirine
(3-azioctanol) was developed (53). this compound acts as an anesthetic in tadpoles, potentiates gabaa receptor function, and inhibits muscle-type nach receptors (53). 3-azioctanol is photoincorporated into torpedo nach receptor  xxxg830xxx 
subunits (53). the primary binding site in the desensitized state of nach receptors
is identified to be  xxxg830xxx -e262 at the extracellular ring of tm2 (54).
recently a new approach, using an alkanethiol anesthetic or a sulfhydrylspecific agent that forms disulfide bonds with a thiol group of a cysteine residue
introduced at the specific site, was employed to show that binding at the site
produces an irreversible anesthetic effect in vitro (55). the ability of an unconventional anesthetic propanethiol under conditions of oxidation by iodine or the
ability of propyl methanethiosulfonate (pmts) to form covalent bonds was examined on gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  mutants in which cysteine residues were
introduced into specific amino acid positions critical for anesthetic modulation in
tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx . propanethiol and pmts irreversibly enhanced function of mutant
receptors at the tm2 critical site, whereas they reversibly potentiate wild-type and
 xxxg2318xxx  mutant receptors, indicating that anesthetics specifically bind to the critical
residues in tm2 (55). thus, this approach provides strong evidence that anesthetic
actions on gabaa and glycine receptors are due to binding at a specific site and
may have general applicability for defining anesthetic binding sites on other brain
receptors.

molecular modeling of anesthetic
interactions with ligand-gated ion channels
why molecular modeling?
most receptor proteins of biological interest are studied after their structure is
determined via x-ray crystallography. this often provides relatively exact atomic
coordinates from which very accurate three-dimensional representations may be
developed. this requires that an adequate amount of purified protein can be made
such that reasonably sized crystals can be formed for examination. the difficulty
of studying the ligand-gated ion channels is that they are transmembrane proteins.
therefore, upon removal from their membrane environment they often become

denatured such that any further purification or crystallization steps become meaningless. this difficulty renders this class of protein poorly amenable to study,
with the current x-ray crystallographic methods of analysis only able to render
very low-resolution structural images (56). in such a case, molecular modeling
has been used to study such systems for the purposes of analyzing and visualizing
protein structure as well as ligand binding (57–59).

controversy over the predicted secondary structure of the
transmembrane regions of ligand-gated ion channels
our initial models assume that the common motif of the ligand-gated ion channel
superfamily is a pentamer of subunits, with each subunit consisting of four antiparallel alpha helices (60). a series of papers by unwin and co-workers (61–63)
strongly supported the general motif of an ion channel composed of five subunits
arranged around a central pore. the suggestion that the other three transmembrane
segments in each subunit are also alpha helices is much more controversial (63–69).
here we review the evidence for each segment.
secondary structure of tm2 although it seems out of order, it is appropriate to
consider tm2 first because it is the pore-lining segment and is the most studied.
cryo-electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that electron density in the
transmembrane region is consistent with five alpha helices lining the central pore of
the nach receptor (63, 70). these alpha helices were identified as tm2 in the nach
receptor in a series of studies in which specific amino acid residues were mutated
to cysteine and labeled with water-soluble reagents (66, 67, 70).
a breakthrough for our proposed molecular modeling occurred recently when
the crystal structure of a bacterial mechanosensitive ion channel was published
(71). this ion channel contains five alpha helices arranged around a central pore with
a right hand supertwist and a funnel shape that is narrowest at the intracellular face
(72). this structure is entirely consistent with predictions made by unwin and
co-workers (61–63) based on electron density in the cryo-electron micrographs of
nach receptors. although early studies predicted a “kink” at the highly conserved
leucine residue lining the ion channel (61), this kink was not observed in a recent
nmr study (73).
secondary structure of tm1 in general, transmembrane domains of proteins
are either all alpha-helical or all beta-barrel. as described above, there is strong evidence
that the pore-lining tm2 segments are alpha helices. as a result, the other three transmembrane segments identified by hydropathy algorithms have long been assumed
to be alpha helices as well. however, some studies suggest that this may not be the case.
for example, exposure of cysteine mutants of tm1 and tm2 of the nach receptor
to a water-soluble probe revealed that tm2 was labeled in a manner consistent
with an alpha helix (70), whereas tm1 was labeled in an irregular manner, indicating
incomplete exposure to the aqueous pore region (66). in addition, this exposure

changed during channel gating, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the channel
changes during gating. a similar result was obtained with the hydrophobic probe
3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125i]-iodophenyl)diazirine in the torpedo nach receptor
(74). the probe reacted nonspecifically with residues 222, 223, 227, and 228, a
pattern of incorporation inconsistent with that expected from “face” of either an
alpha helix or a beta sheet. additional uncertainty about the secondary structure of tm1
was provided by proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry studies of the glycine
receptor (68). this study found cleavage sites within the putative tm1 and  xxxg2318xxx 
transmembrane helices. the authors interpreted these cleavage sites as evidence
for a mixture of alpha helices and beta sheets within this region (68). an alternative explanation is that the very aggressive detergents (triton x-100) used in isolation of
receptors before proteolytic digestion resulted in denaturation of the receptor and
exposure of inappropriate cleavage sites. there is similar concern about the ftir
spectroscopy study that found only 50% alpha-helical content after vigorous removal
of the extracellular domain with proteinase k (69). in contrast to the conclusion of
the previous study, recent studies in the nach receptor supported an all alpha-helical
structure in the transmembrane domain (75, 76).
secondary structure of  xxxg2318xxx  this segment is the subject of much research
and controversy. there is strong evidence that the tm2-3 loop is involved in
transmission of a signal from agonist binding at the agonist-binding site to the
ion channel pore (77–80). if both tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  were alpha helices connected by
a short loop, there would be analogy to the established mode of light activation
of rhodopsin (81). in addition, it was recently shown that activation by gaba
increases the water-accessibility of m3 membrane-spanning residues in gaba
receptors (67). this result suggests that channel gating involves motion of the
transmembrane segments relative to each other. however, initial cryo-electron
microscopy by unwin did not observe clear evidence of alpha helices in the region
of  xxxg2318xxx  (61). in the absence of this evidence he proposed other, more random,
structures for this segment. on the other hand, a recent nmr study of a synthetic
peptide corresponding to the putative  xxxg2318xxx  from torpedo californica concluded
that the segment has an alpha-helical structure (82).
secondary structure of tm4 the lipid-protein interface of the torpedo nach
receptor was identified with the hydrophobic probe 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125i]iodophenyl)diazirine (74). the periodicity of the resulting labeling was consistent
with both  xxxg2318xxx  and tm4 being alpha helices. the cholesterol-binding domain in the
nach receptor has been located near tm4 with [125i] azido-cholesterol (83). early
studies demonstrated that the tm4 segment could be substituted with homologous
sequences without loss of receptor function (84). however, more recent studies
have shown that substitution of c418 in tm4 by tryptophan altered ion channel
function (85). the latter studies suggest that although tm4 is thought to be distant
from the channel pore, it is important in gating of the ion channel.

tertiary structure model of the gabaa receptor subunit
molecular modeling we obtained the sequences of nine related proteins in the
superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. these were nach receptor alpha 4, alpha 7, and
torpedo alpha subunits; gabaa receptor alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 3 subunits;  xxxg904xxx 
alpha 1 subunit; and gaba receptor rho 1 subunit. we predicted the topology of the
transmembrane domains of these segments with the bioinformatics techniques
phdhtm and hmmtop. the ends of the transmembrane alpha helices were averaged.
the sequences were simultaneously aligned with the multiple sequence alignments
algorithm clustalw. the averaged secondary structure predictions were added to
the multiple sequence alignment to give a clearer picture of regions of secondary
structure and helical limits that were common to all nine sequences. this analysis
clearly predicted that the four transmembrane segments (tm1–4) were all alpha helices
with reasonably well-defined helical ends.
this secondary structure information was then used in conjunction with the seqfold algorithm to search for a modeling template based upon both sequence and
fold homology/analogy. although the seqfold search of a modified version of the
protein data bank produced several well-scored alignments, there was only one
template that was of mammalian origin and showed an alignment over all four transmembrane domains. this was the chain c domain 1 portion of bovine cytochrome
oxidase, 1occ.pdb (figure 2). in a qualitative search of both the scop (structural
classification of proteins) and cath (class, architecture, topology, and homologous superfamily) fold databases, this template was again the only one found that
was a tetramer of alpha helices, mammalian in origin and common to both databases.
this template was then aligned with the sequence of gabaa receptor alpha 2 subunit.
this alignment was initially scored based upon sequence similarity, fold similarity, and the mean force potential of sippl (86). we used knowledge-based modeling to produce agreement with the hydrophilic and hydrophobic labeling studies
(figure 3a) carried out in the homologous nach receptors (66, 67, 74) and with
the proposed juxtaposition of arg 273 and asp 286 to form a salt bridge. we also
hypothesized that the lack of a halothane effect owing to the l231f mutation (87)
was due to its proximity to ser 269 and ala 290 (tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  residues critical
for anesthetic actions, respectively). conformer libraries were used to provide
reasonable initial orientations of the amino acid side chains. the loops between
alpha helices were constructed to minimize fraying of helical ends. the tm1-2 and
tm2-3 loops were constructed using the loop modeling features within the swiss
protein data bank viewer (88). these are based upon loop fragment sequence
similarities to loops of known three-dimensional structure. the large  xxxg2318xxx -4 loop
was removed and replaced by a series of 6 glycine residues. this substitution
allowed maximum flexibility of the loop, but maintained a reasonable distance
between the end of  xxxg2318xxx  and the beginning of tm4.
the entire structure was subjected to sequentially restrained molecular mechanics energy optimization. because the sequence of gabaa receptor alpha 2 subunit is
quite different from the primary sequence of the template, we used a previously

described technique to maintain the left-handed supertwist of the template of four
alpha helices without imposing additional restraints on the backbone atoms (89). each
alpha helix was divided into an upper, middle, and lower third. then a centroid of
the backbone atoms of each third was defined. distance restraints were applied to
maintain an 11 å separation between adjacent centroids of neighboring alpha helices.
these restraints had the appearance of three squares, one each at the upper, middle,
and lower levels of the tetramer. the structure was optimized using these restraints
with discover 98 (msi, san diego, ca) and the cff91 forcefield. in order to
allow the side chains of the tetramer to adjust to optimum packing before the helical backbone was distorted, the initial force constant of the centroid restraints was
set to 100 kcal/å2 with subsequent reductions to 10 and 1 kcal/å2 in sequential
optimizations.
we then used a template-forcing algorithm to align the tm2 alpha helix of this
tetramer onto the pore-lining alpha helix of the pentameric bacterial stretch receptor
[1msl (mechanosensitive ion channel) in the protein data bank]. this was repeated
with fivefold symmetry to produce a pentamer of tetramers totaling 20 alpha helices. simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics produced our final
structure. we used two sets of restraints in these simulations. first, the distance
restraints between alpha helices defined above were used for each subunit with a force
constant of 10 kcal/å2. second, the template forcing distances that were used to
construct the pentamer of tm2 segments onto the 1msl template were retained and
assigned a force constant of 100 kcal/å2. we subjected this restrained structure
to molecular dynamics with sequential steps (10,000 cycles of 1 femtosecond) of
heating by 100◦ k up to 500◦ k, an equilibration step of 10,000 cycles at 500◦ k, and
then cooling steps of 100◦ k. finally, we re-optimized the structure with molecular
mechanics, and recorded energies of both bonded and nonbonded interactions.
this procedure produced a structure in which specific amino acid residues from
all four transmembrane alpha helices were in direct proximity to one another. these
residues are leu 231 (tm1), ser 269 (tm2), ala 290 ( xxxg2318xxx ), and val 407 (tm4).
whereas residues that were homologous to ser 269 and ala 290 were previously
studied in the  xxxg904xxx  as being fundamental to anesthetic action, it is only
recently that the residue homologous to leu 231 has been shown to be important
as well (87). lastly, this model clearly predicts that it is the val 407 on tm4 that
should prove to be important for anesthetic binding in conjunction with the other
three residues (figure 3b).
size of the anesthetic binding pocket we used molecular modeling to visualize
the effect of site-directed mutations in the glycine and gaba receptors. a common
theme was the volume of a site in the transmembrane domain. homologous nalcohols increase in cns depressant potency as the length of the carbon chain
increases, up to a point at which further increases in molecular size decrease
(or no longer increase) alcohol potency. this is termed the cutoff. our group
found that alcohol regulation of the  xxxg904xxx  critically depends on specific
amino acid residues in tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of the  xxxg216xxx  polypeptide (29). they

demonstrated that residues in the glycine alpha 1 receptors and the gaba rho 1 receptor
also control alcohol cutoff. mutation of ser 267 to gln (s267q) decreased the
n-alcohol cutoff in glycine alpha 1 receptor. conversely, mutation of ile 307 and/or trp
328 to smaller residues increased the n-alcohol cutoff in the gaba rho 1 receptor.
these results are consistent with the suggestion that n-alcohol binding sites within
these transmembrane proteins modulate the action of these alcohols, and that amino
acid residues present at these critical positions limit the size of alcohol molecules
that can interact with the binding cavity.
we modeled the double site-directed mutation of ile to ser at position 307
(i307s) in tm2, and trp to ala at position 328 (w328a) in  xxxg2318xxx  in the human
gaba receptor rho 1 subunit. the change in van der waals volume resulting from
the double site-directed mutation, assuming that the inter-helical packing does not
allow movement of the backbone atoms of the helices, is 162 − 109 = 53 å3 plus
224 − 99 = 125 å3, a total volume change of 178 å3. this volume corresponds
to that of c7h15oh. in the series of alcohols studied, each additional ch2 adds
approximately 20 a3 of van der waals volume. the volume of 178 å3 is equivalent
to 8.9 additional methylenes (178 å3/20 å3). on this basis, we predicted that the
double site-directed mutation could increase the alcohol cutoff by 8 to 9 methylene
groups. we observed that the double site-directed mutation increased the alcohol
cutoff by at least 7 methylenes (29) (alcohols greater than c-12 were too insoluble
to test).
interactions with anesthetics residues in our current model of gabaa receptor
alpha 2 subunit were replaced at several positions in an effort to elucidate the effect of
side chain volume characteristics on the anesthetic binding regions noted above.
these mutations were s269a, s269w, and s269w + a290w (a jenkins, ep
greenblatt, hj faulkner, e bertaccini, a light, a andreasen, a viner, jr trudell,
nl harrison, unpublished data). the resulting three new models were re-optimized
as above. we defined a site midway between the ca carbons of residues 269 and
290. at this site we manually inserted halothane, isoflurane, and either one or
two chloroform molecules to produce a set of 16 ligand-receptor complexes. all
protein backbone atoms in these models were constrained to their initial positions.
only movement of the ligand and those amino acids residues within 5 å of this
ligand was allowed. each of these complexes was subjected to simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics. the many restraints in these calculations
cause the resulting energies of these ligand-receptor complexes to be of only qualitative value. however, they suggest that all three ligands bind well to sites near
s269 or a290. the single tryptophan mutant (s269w) binds only one chloroform
well, suggesting that the native binding pocket, with a smaller amino acid residue,
could contain two chloroform molecules. the double tryptophan mutant (s269w +
a290w) produces an unstable complex in the forced presence of all ligands.
therefore, based upon our knowledge of transmembrane mutations and their
effects on anesthetic activity, the way in which transmembrane amino acids can
be chemically labeled, the physicochemical characteristics among series of

anesthetics that are favorable for activity, and the ways in which anesthetics bind to
generic proteins, one can look for sites in ligand-gated ion channels that meet these
criteria. with this, we can show that the region that is both necessary and sufficient
for anesthetic activity is the region within the tetrameric subunit of ligand-gated
ion channels that is bounded by four specific amino acids: leu 231 (tm1), ser
269 (tm2), ala 290 ( xxxg2318xxx ), and val 407 (tm4).

correlation with in vivo anesthetic action
stereoselectivity
general anesthetic stereoselectivity poses the greatest challenge to traditional lipid
theories of anesthetic actions because optical isomers of general anesthetics behave
identically with respect to their ability to disorder lipid bilayers, despite significant differences in their in vivo potency (90, 91). furthermore, stereoselectivity
represents a powerful test for the relevance of a putative anesthetic target, i.e. if a
given receptor is one of the important anesthetic targets, the rank order and ratio of
potency of the optical isomers should be similar for producing anesthetic actions
and for modulating the receptor function.
r(+) etomidate is ∼17 times as potent as s(−) etomidate to induce a loss of
righting reflex in tadpoles, and the r(+) isomer is 6–10 times more effective than
the s(−) isomer at potentiating gaba-induced currents (91).
steroid anesthetics such as 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one are enantioselective both for inducing a loss of righting reflex in tadpoles and mice and for potentiating gaba-induced currents, with (+) isomer exhibiting greater potency than
(−) isomer (92, 93).
s isomers of barbiturates are generally more potent than r isomers for their
anesthetic activities (94). gabaa receptor responses are potentiated by s isomers of  xxxd2279xxx , pentobarbital, and thiopental more potently than by their r
isomers by a factor of 2–4 (95, 96), whereas neuronal alpha 4beta 2 nach receptor is inhibited by r(+) thiopental more effectively than by s(−) thiopental, and inhibition
of neuronal alpha 7 and muscle alpha 1beta 1gamma delta nach receptors by thiopental isomers shows
no stereoselectivity (97). furthermore, gabaa receptor function is enhanced by
an anesthetic barbiturate r(−) 1-methyl-5-phenyl-5-propyl barbiturate (mppb),
but is inhibited by its convulsant stereoisomer s(+) mppb (98, 99), whereas both
r(−) and s(+) mppb inhibited amap (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx ) receptor current responses, with r(−) mppb being only
slightly potent compared with s(+) mppb (99).
s(+) isoflurane are slightly (∼20–50%) more potent than r(−) isoflurane for
measurements of sleep time and mac (100–102). s(+) isoflurane is ∼2 times
more potent than r(−) isoflurane to potentiate gabaa receptor function (103–
105), and ∼1.5 times more potent to inhibit neuronal nach receptor currents (90).
in contrast, two optical isomers of isoflurane are equally effective in potentiating
 xxxg904xxx  currents (106).

s(+) ketamine is 3–4 times more potent than r(−) ketamine as an analgesic
agent (107–108) and 1.5–4 times more potent in terms of hypnotic activity (107–
109). s(+) ketamine is 2–4 times more potent than r(−) ketamine in inhibiting nmda receptor currents (110–112), whereas s(+) ketamine is 1.5 times
as potent as r(−) ketamine in reducing neuronal excitation by acetylcholine
(113).
thus, in general, the consistent correlation of in vivo anesthetic potencies of
optical isomers of several anesthetics with their potencies for modulating receptor
function is observed only for potentiation of gabaa receptor activity (except for
ketamine and nmda receptors), supporting the plausibility of gabaa receptors
as anesthetic targets.

nonimmobilizers
certain highly lipid-soluble halogenated cyclobutanes and alkanes are unable to
induce immobility at concentrations predicted by the meyer-overton rule to be in
the anesthetic range (114). the nonimmobilizers provide clues to the relevance of
a putative anesthetic target, i.e. if a given receptor is one of the anesthetic targets,
anesthetics should affect the receptor, but nonimmobilizers should not modulate the
receptor function. the nonimmobilizer 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (f6)
exhibits no modulatory effects on gabaa (115), glycine (13), gabac rho (10),
5-ht3 (116), neuronal nach (117), ampa (18), kainate (18), or nmda (t
yamakura & ra harris, unpublished data) receptors. muscle nach receptors
are affected by f6 through mechanisms distinct from anesthetics (118–119). on
the other hand, f6 inhibits responses of g protein–coupled receptors such as
metabotropic glutamate (120), muscarinic ach (121), or 5-ht2a (122) receptors the way volatile anesthetics do. these results would seem to exclude these
g protein–coupled receptors as viable targets for producing immobility. these
receptors may certainly play a role in other actions, such as amnesia, because
nonimmobilizers may depress learning and memory (123).

gene targeting
gene targeting in mice is very powerful for elucidating the in vivo roles of certain ligand-gated ion channel subunits in mediating diverse behavioral actions of
general anesthetics. several knockout mice lacking specific subunits for ligandgated ion channels have already been created, and anesthetic sensitivities have
been determined in some of these mice (124).
mice lacking the beta 3 subunits of gabaa receptors exhibit some resistance to
the immobilizing actions of halothane and  xxxd1993xxx , but sensitivity to obtunding
(loss of righting reflex) effects of volatile anesthetics is not altered (125). these
mice are also more resistant to obtunding effects of etomidate and midazolam, but
not to those of pentobarbital and ethanol, compared with wild-type mice (125).
mice lacking the alpha 6 subunits of gabaa receptors exhibit sensitivities to the
immobilizing actions of  xxxd1993xxx  and obtunding effects of halothane,  xxxd1993xxx ,

pentobarbital, and ethanol, which are not significantly different from those of
wild-type mice (126).
mice deficient in the delta subunits of gabaa receptors exhibit a selective attenuation of sensitivities to obtunding effects of neuroactive steroids such as alphaxalone and pregnanolone (127). this is surprising because the presence of the delta
subunits reduces modulation of recombinant gabaa receptors by neurosteroids
(128). sensitivities to halothane, propofol, midazolam, etomidate, and ketamine
are unaffected by the  xxxg219xxx  knockouts (127).
mice deficient in  xxxg953xxx  subunits of ampa receptors show increased sensitivity
to behavioral effects of pentobarbital (loss of righting reflex and loss of corneal,
pineal, and toe-pinch withdrawal reflexes) despite reduced pentobarbital inhibition
of ampa receptors in their hippocampal neurons (129).
although knockout mice may provide initial clues to the nature of anesthetic
targets, results can be difficult to interpret because compensation for the absent
subunits by alterations in other subunits may occur. furthermore, aberrations in
neural development, grossly abnormal motor behavior, and lethality may preclude
analyzing the anesthetic sensitivity. these shortcomings of global gene knockouts
may be circumvented by conditional gene knockouts, which enable gene knockouts
only in limited brain regions and/or specified developmental stages (130). another
strategy overcoming the limitations of global gene knockouts is the gene knock-in
technique. this technique introduces, for example, a mutation into receptor subunits that eliminates anesthetic modulation but does not alter other physiological
function. this approach has recently applied to benzodiazepines, and revealed that
the alpha 1 subunit of gabaa receptors mediates sedative, hypnotic, and partly anticonvulsant actions of diazepam, but not anxiolytic, myorelaxant, motor-impairing,
and  xxxd102xxx potentiating effects of diazepam (131).

concluding remarks and future directions
as reviewed above, the most plausible target of general anesthetics among ligandgated ion channels is the gabaa receptor. however, there are also some anesthetics that do not affect the gabaa receptors at clinical concentrations, i.e. gaseous
anesthetics nitrous oxide and xenon, dissociative anesthetic ketamine, and fluorinated alcohols that have in vivo anesthetic effects (20–22, 24, 25, 132–134). thus,
it is unlikely that gabaa receptors are universal anesthetic targets involved in
producing general anesthesia. general anesthesia, however, is a behavioral state
that requires varying degrees of immobility, amnesia, hypnosis/unconsciousness,
analgesia, and so on. considering that different classes of anesthetics have distinct
behavioral effects, it may not be surprising that a wide variety of anesthetics has a
diverse pattern of actions not only on ligand-gated ion channels, but also on other
brain receptors/proteins. these issues are related to the key question of whether the
neuronal function mediating certain behavioral actions of anesthesia is common
to every general anesthetic or not (the unitary theory). in vivo studies of specific

molecular mechanisms of anesthesia

anesthetic behaviors are required to address this question, and the most convincing
investigation to directly correlate the anesthetic behaviors and neuronal function
will be the analysis of gene knock-in mice with a mutation in target proteins
that eliminates anesthetic actions but does not otherwise change the physiological
function. this experiment may be complicated if multiple subunit isoforms are
involved in producing an anesthetic behavior, but recent knock-in studies showing
a specific role of the alpha 1 subunit of gabaa receptors in certain types of behavioral
actions of benzodiazepines (131) are encouraging for future anesthetic research.
through the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of general anesthesia in conjunction with structural biology and rational drug design, it may become possible
to develop specific behavior- or target site–oriented anesthetic strategies without
interfering with other physiological functions.
