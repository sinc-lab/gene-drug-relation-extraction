abstract
zaltoprofen, a preferential cox-2 inhibitor, exhibited a potent inhibitory action on the nociceptive responses induced by a retrograde infusion
of bradykinin into the right common carotid artery in rats. however, other cox-2 preferential inhibitors such as  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2065xxx  did not
exhibit any apparent action, and also, preferential  xxxg1883xxx  inhibitors mofezolac and indomethacin,  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 inhibitor loxoprofen sodium
showed a weak effect. these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) except for zaltoprofen, strongly inhibited an acetic acid-induced
writhing response related to pgs based on  xxxg1883xxx , at lower doses. zaltoprofen had a moderate inhibitory effect compared with those of the abovementioned nsaids. these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of zaltoprofen on bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses is not explainable
by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox). so, we examined the inhibitory effect of zaltoprofen on bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses by
performing several in vitro experiments. zaltoprofen did not bind to b1 and b2 receptors in a radio-ligand binding assay. in the cultured dorsal root
ganglion cells of mature mice, zaltoprofen completely inhibited the bradykinin-induced increase of [ca2+]i, which was inhibited by b2 antagonist
 xxxd862xxx -[hyp3, thi5,8, d-phe7]-bradykinin, but not by b1 antagonist. in addition, the inhibition of zaltoprofen on the increase of [ca2+]i was
observed even under extracellular ca2+-free conditions. the above results suggest that zaltoprofen produces an analgesic action on bradykinininduced nociceptive responses by blocking the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx -mediated pathway in the primary sensory neurons. taken together, these results suggest
that zaltoprofen may serve as a potent and  xxxd2565xxx  for the treatment of pain.

1. introduction
a subset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) has recently been reported to demonstrate a diverse
pharmacological effect that is not related to the inhibitory
activity of cyclooxygenases (coxs). zaltoprofen ((+/)-2(10,11-dihydro-10-oxo-dibenzo[b, f]thiepin-2-yl)-propionic
acid) is an nsaid with powerful anti-inflammatory effects
as well as an analgesic action on inflammatory pain (tsurumi
et al., 1986a; kameyama et al., 1987). zaltoprofen selectively
inhibits pge2 production at inflammatory sites exhibiting an
anti-inflammatory effect (ed50, 1–5 mg/kg, p.o.) with a good
safety margin (ud50, 50–100 mg/kg, p.o.) (tsurumi et al.,
1986a,b; nishioka et al., 2000; kunigami et al., 2001). in

addition, zaltoprofen was shown to inhibit bradykinin-induced
nociceptive responses more potently than indomethacin
whereas diclofenac sodium and ibuprofen were not
(kameyama et al., 1987). we have also shown that zaltoprofen
inhibits effects on bradykinin-induced 12-lipoxygenase (lox)
activation in vitro (tang et al., 2005).
recently, research on the mechanism of pain development at
polymodal nociceptors has advanced, clarifying that bradykinin
is an algesic or sensitizing substance (premkumar and ahern,
2000; mizumura et al., 1990). there are b1 and b2 bradykinin
receptors; the former is inducible, while the latter is
constitutive. it has been reported that bradykinin-induced
nociceptive responses are produced through the gq proteincoupled  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  and a number of different signal
transduction pathways, including phospholipase c (plc),
 xxxg1759xxx , lox, cox and others, in dorsal root
ganglion (drg) cells (chuang et al., 2004; vanegas and
schaible, 2001; shin et al., 2002; tang et al., 2004). in addition,

it has been reported that stimulation of the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx 
sensitizes  xxxg2335xxx  (vr-1) via protein kinase c
(pkc) (sugiura et al., 2002).
bradykinin is a potent endogenous algesic substance, and
many studies have demonstrated its association with pain in
humans. for example, the injection of bradykinin causes
muscular hyperalgesia in humans (graven-nielsen and mense,
2001; mork et al., 2003). in addition, several studies have
proven that pain and the production of bradykinin at the
inflamed sites increase over time following third molar
extraction (hargreaves et al., 1993), that blood bradykinin
concentration increases with the development of muscle pain
following excessive weight training (blais et al., 1999), and that
bradykinin concentration increases in the joint cavities of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (sharma and buchanan,
1994). thus, there is a large body of evidence regarding the role
of bradykinin in the development of pain associated with
various diseases.
nsaids were classified according to their chemical
structure or their selective inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2.
zaltoprofen is a  xxxd3029xxx  derivative with a tri-cyclic
formula. in the present study, we examined whether zaltoprofen
and other types of nsaids have a similar analgesic action on
bradykinin- and acetic acid-induced nociceptive responses, and
found that only zaltoprofen inhibited bradykinin-induced
nociceptive responses. thus, we examined the inhibitory effect
of zaltoprofen on bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses in
several in vitro experiments using a radio-ligand binding assay
and cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion cells.

bradykinin, a bradykinin b1 antagonist and  xxxd862xxx -[hyp3, thi5,8, d-phe7]bradykinin, a bradykinin b2 antagonist, were purchased from sigma–aldrich.
0.5 ml/100 g body weight was orally administered in the rat in vivo study. in
the mouse study, 0.1 ml/10 g body weight was orally administered.

2.3. bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses in rats
a total of six to eight male wistar rats per group were used. under ether
anesthesia, a polyethylene cannula (intramedic, pe-50, i.d. = 0.58 mm,
o.d. = 0.965 mm) filled with physiological saline containing heparin was
inserted retrogradely toward the heart into the right common carotid artery.
the opposite end of the cannula was pulled out from the back of the neck and
was capped. after the rats awoke from anesthesia, 0.4–0.6 mg of bradykinin
solution (2 mg/ml) were infused through the rubber cap of the cannula. the rats
which clearly exhibited the three different pseudo pain reactions ((1) bending of
the right forelimb, (2) turning of the head to the right and (3) increase in motor
activity) within 30 s after the injection of bradykinin were selected. bradykinin
was injected every 15 min, and the animals were observed up to 120 min after
the oral administration of the test compound. test compound was assessed the
analgesic effect to be present when two out of the three reactions were inhibited.
the effects of test compounds were investigated in blinded manner.

2.4. acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice
a total of 10 male icr mice (5-week-old) per group were used. an acetic
acid (0.6%) solution at 0.1 ml/10 g b.w. was intraperitoneally administered to
count the incidence of writhing after administration for 20 min. the test
compound was orally administered at 30 min before the administration of
the acetic acid.  xxxd2561xxx  was administered at 60 min before. the percentage
of inhibition was calculated as follows:

2.1. animals

2.5.1. b1 membranes preparation
membranes were prepared from human hs729 (rhabdomyosacroma) cells
that were treated with 0.1 mg/ml  xxxd2925xxx  (pma) for 4–
6 h to enhance the number of bradykinin b1 receptors.
the cells in the plate were washed two to three times with 20 ml
dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (dpbs). to this, 10 ml tem buffer
(25 mm tris–hcl, 1 mm edta, 6 mm mgcl2 with 100 mm pmsf, 1 mm
pepstatin a and 1 mm leupeptin) was added, and the cells were scraped off.
the cells were transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge bottle, and the cell suspension
was kept on ice. these steps were repeated until all the cells were harvested.
units of 30 ml of cells were homogenized at a time using 10 strokes with a
motor-driven teflon pestle (potter elvehjem tissue grinder, wheaton). the
homogenate was centrifuged at 800  g for 10 min at 4 8c. the supernatant
was transferred to centrifuge tubes, the cell pellets were collected, and this
process was repeated. the supernatant was combined and centrifuged at
100,000  g (l8-m ultracentrifuge, beckman) for 45 min at 4 8c. the pellets
were collected and resuspended in the tem buffer. this was recentrifuged at
100,000  g for 45 min at 4 8c. the pellets were collected, and 1 ml aliquots
of the membrane preparation were frozen in the tem buffer and stored at
80 8c. the protein concentration was determined using the pierce bca
protein assay.

eight-week-old male wistar rats (charles river japan inc.) and 5–8-weekold male icr mice (charles river japan inc.) were housed under conditions of
constant temperature (23  2 8c) and constant humidity (55  10%) for at least
5 days, and only healthy animals were used for the study. all procedures used in
the present study were approved by the research laboratories animal care
committee in nippon chemiphar co. ltd. and by the tokai university animal
care committee, and were in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the
international association for the study of pain (zimmermann, 1983).

2.2. drugs
zaltoprofen ((+/)-2-(10,11-dihydro-10-oxo-dibenzo[b, f]thiepin-2-yl) xxxd3029xxx ),  xxxd2561xxx  and celecoxib were synthesized in the laboratory
of nippon chemiphar co. ltd. we used crystals of loxoprofen sodium,  xxxd2065xxx 
and mofezolac extracted from marketed products (loxonin tablets, sankyo;
 xxxd2065xxx  tablets, nippon shinyaku; disopain tablets, yoshitomi, respectively).
indomethacin and diclofenac sodium were purchased from sigma–aldrich,
japan. the test compounds were suspended or dissolved in a 1%  xxxd2609xxx  (shin-etsu chemical) solution for a rat in vivo study. all compounds were
suspended in a 0.2% carboxy  xxxd2609xxx  solution for the study in mice.
bradykinin (peptide institute inc.) was dissolved in physiological saline to be
diluted for use in the bradykinin-induced pain study. in intracellular calcium
measurements using drg, bradykinin (sigma–aldrich) was dissolved in
distilled water to 1 mg/2 ml, and the solution was divided into 200 ml to
be frozen and stored. the bradykinin solutions were diluted with na+-rich
solution (modified hepes ringer solution) before use. lys-[des-arg9, leu8]-

2.5.2. b2 membrane preparation
ilea tissues from adult male duncan hartley-derived guinea pigs were
homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose using a polytron at setting 5 for 20 s. the
homogenate was centrifuged at 500  g for 10 min at 4 8c. subsequently, the
supernatant was spun at 100,000  g (l8-m ultracentrifuge, beckman) for
45 min at 4 8c. the pellets were stored at 80 8c until use.

2.5.3. b1 binding assay
a total of 3 mg of membrane was incubated with 2.5 nm [3h] des-arg10kallidin concentration in 222 ml of assay buffer (20 mm hepes, 125 mm nmethyl-d-glucamine, 5 mm kcl, 140 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) ph 7.4 for 60 min at 25 8c. at the end of the incubation period, each
tube was filtered under vacuum pressure through a whatman gf/b glass fiber
filter that had been pretreated with 0.1% aqueous polyethylenimine. the filters
and tubes were washed three times with 1 ml of ice cold dpbs buffer, and
radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. non-specific
binding was estimated in the presence of 10 mm des-arg9-[leu8]-bradykinin.

2.5.4. b2 binding assay
a total of 1 mg of membrane was incubated with 0.4 nm [3h] bradykinin
concentration in 522 ml of assay buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate containing 0.1% bsa, 140 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm captopril and
1 mm phenanthroline) ph 6.5 for 90 min at 25 8c. at the end of the incubation
period, each tube was filtered under vacuum pressure through a whatman gf/b
glass fiber filter that had been pretreated with 0.1% aqueous polyethylenimine.
the filters and tubes were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold 25 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, and radioactivity was determined using a liquid
scintillation counter. non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of
1 mm bradykinin.

2.6. bradykinin-induced elevation of [ca2+]i in drg cells
eight-week-old male icr mice were anesthetized to death. the dorsal root
ganglion cells were isolated from each mouse. the drg cells were treated with
0.2% collagenase at 37 8c for 90 min, and after the cells were washed, they
were treated with 0.25% trypsin at 37 8c for 15 min. the reactions were stopped
with a 0.06%  xxxd207xxx , and the cells were dissociated using a pipette.
the cell suspension was subjected to density gradient centrifugation in a 30%
percoll solution, resulting in a precipitate. after being washed with ham’s f-12
containing 10% fbs (life technologies), the resulting precipitate was seeded
on 35-mm culture dishes and incubated in ham’s f-12 medium containing 10%
fbs, 2 mm of glutamine and 50 mg/ml of penicillin–streptomycin at 37 8c for
4 h in an atmosphere containing 5% co2. then, the medium was replaced with
a medium containing 100 ng/ml of 7s ngf (life technologies) and 10% fbs
for further incubation. at 28 h after seeding, the medium was replaced again
with the fbs-free medium containing ngf, its-g supplement (gibco;
10 mg/ml insulin, 3  108 m sodium selenite and 5.5 mg/ml transferrin),
0.1 mm of putrescine and 2  108 m of progesterone for further incubation.
the cells were used for measurement on day 3 or 4 after seeding. the culture
solution was removed and replaced with a solution containing fluo-3-am
(1 mm), and the cells were loaded at 37 8c for 30 min. after that, the cells were
washed with a culture solution, and the culture solution was replaced with a
na+-rich solution with ca2+ (hepes ringer solution: nacl 145 mm, kcl
4.7 mm, cacl2 2.5 mm, mgcl2 1.13 mm, d-glucose 10 mm, hepes 10 mm,
 xxxd3253xxx  330–340 mm, ph 7.4). for the measurement under ca2+-free
extracellular conditions, a ca2+-free solution (cacl2 was removed from a
na+-rich solution with ca2+, and 1 mm of egta was added) was used. a
confocal laser-scanning microscope (leica tcs nt) was used to measure
[ca2+]i. the wavelength of excitation light was 488 nm, and a fitc/tritc
filter was used. the [ca2+]i of drg cell loaded with fluo-3-am was determined by fluorescent intensity obtained with a confocal laser-scanning microscope. changes in [ca2+]i were indicated by the increase in fluorescence
intensity (arbitrary unit) by combining fluo-3 with ca2+. bradykinin and the
test compounds were applied using the dropping method. bradykinin was
applied to the cells, and after confirming the increase of [ca2+]i, the bradykinin
was washed out. thirty minutes later, the application of the test compound was
started, and 5 min later, bradykinin was applied. cells of less than 25 mm in
diameter were used for all the experiments.

2.7. statistical procedure
in the examination of bradykinin-induced nociceptive behavior, the ed50
and 95% confidence interval were determined from the number of responders at
the measurement point when the maximum analgesic effect of the test com-

pound was observed using the litchfield–wilcoxon method. the ed50 of each
test compound treatment group in the acetic acid-induced writhing test was
determined by the regression line formula, and the 95% confidence limits were
calculated using fieller’s formula.

3. results
3.1. bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses in rats
a retrograde infusion of bradykinin into the right common
carotid artery in rats caused short-term (10–30 s) nociceptive
responses ((1) bending of the right forelimb, (2) turning of the
head to the right and (3) increase in motor activity) within a few
seconds. the control group (vehicle administration) exhibited
no decrease in the bradykinin-induced responses within the
120-min observation period.
zaltoprofen at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o., inhibited
bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses (fig. 1). the ed50
value (95% confidence limits) was 9.7 mg/kg (5.1–18.4 mg/
kg). the duration of analgesic effect of zaltoprofen was 60–
90 min. mofezolac (100 mg/kg) and indomethacin (30 mg/kg)
exhibited an inhibitory action in 3/6 and 3/8 rats, respectively.
loxoprofen sodium exhibited an inhibitory action from a dose
of 20 mg/kg, with the ed50 (95% confidence interval) being
40.0 mg/kg (14.1–113.7 mg/kg). diclofenac sodium,  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2065xxx  demonstrated no apparent inhibitory action
on bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses even at a dose of
100 mg/kg. since the dosage of all test compounds except
zaltoprofen substantially exceeded the doses that produce an
ulcerogenic activity or anti-inflammatory action, we did not
examine higher doses. the bradykinin-induced nociceptive
responses were inhibited by the subcutaneous administration of
 xxxd862xxx -[hyp3, thi5,8, d-phe7]-bradykinin, a selective b2
receptor antagonist (data not shown).

b1 and b2 receptors was examined. the inhibition of
zaltoprofen  xxxd1891xxx  mm for the specific binding of each radioligand to the b1 and b2 receptors were 22 and 1%,
respectively (table 2). zaltoprofen did not exhibit any
apparent affinity. des-arg10-kallidin and bradykinin, which
were b1 and  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  specific ligands used as reference
compounds, exhibited apparent displacement to the b1 and
b2 receptors, respectively (table 2).

3.2. acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice
zaltoprofen at doses of 3–30 mg/kg, p.o., inhibited the acetic
acid-induced writhing response in a dose-dependent manner.
the ed50 value (95% confidence limits) was 17.1 mg/kg (13.0–
24.5 mg/kg) (table 1). mofezolac, indomethacin and loxoprofen sodium exhibited inhibitory action at lower doses than that

when bradykinin  xxxd1891xxx  mm was applied to fluo-3-am

defined as a calcium increase that attenuated within 3 min and
persisted for more than 3 min, respectively. the transient
response was observed in 77% of the cells and the tonic
response in the remaining 23%. the peak amplitude of
fluorescence intensity was 16.5  1.7 in cells showing a
transient response and 19.3  3.4 in those showing a tonic
response. since there was little difference between the transient
and tonic response in amplitude, cells showing a transient
response were mainly used. bradykinin was repetitively
applied at 0, 30 and 60 min to the same cell. the amplitude
of the response to the third application was not below 50% of
that observed after the first application. in addition, the
bradykinin-induced increase of [ca2+]i was also observed under
extracellular ca2+-free conditions in which only the transient
response was observed (fig. 3b, left).
the increase of [ca2+]i induced by 10 mm bradykinin was
completely abolished by  xxxd862xxx -[hyp3, thi5,8, d-phe7]bradykinin  xxxd1891xxx –50 mm, a b2 antagonist, whereas lys[des-arg9, leu8]-bradykinin at 50 mm, a b1 antagonist, did
not inhibit it (data not shown). zaltoprofen at 0.1, 0.5 and
1 mm inhibited the bradykinin-induced increase of [ca2+]i
(figs. 2 and 3a). the response to bradykinin in the presence
of zaltoprofen occurred in an all-or-none manner. the
percentage of inhibited cells under each concentration of
zaltoprofen was 50, 100 and 100%, respectively. from five to
six cells were used to test each concentration of zaltoprofen.
moreover, zaltoprofen at concentrations of 1 and 5 mm also
inhibited the tonic response to bradykinin. under ca2+-free
conditions the bradykinin-induced increase of [ca2+]i was
inhibited by zaltoprofen at concentrations of 0.5 and 5 mm
(fig. 3b).

4. discussion
in the present study, we show first that zaltoprofen exhibited
a potent analgesic action on nociceptive responses induced by
bradykinin (ed50, 9.7 mg/kg, p.o.) but not on those induced by
acetic acid (17.1 mg/kg, p.o.). however, mofezolac and
indomethacin (preferentially  xxxg1883xxx  inhibitors), loxoprofen
sodium ( xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 inhibitor) and  xxxd2561xxx  and
 xxxd2065xxx  (preferentially cox-2 inhibitors) did not show a
significant effect on the bradykinin-induced responses or
showed a slight inhibitory action only at higher doses, but
strongly inhibited the acetic acid-induced writhing response.
zaltoprofen blocked specifically the nociceptive behavior
induced by bradykinin. zaltoprofen has a mild ulcerogenic
activity (ud50, 50–100 mg/kg, p.o.) due to  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition
(tsurumi et al., 1986b; nishioka et al., 2000; kunigami et al.,
2001). we expected that zaltoprofen would inhibit acetic acidinduced behavior at higher doses. in the acetic acid-induced
writhing model, intraperitoneally injected acetic acid induced
an increased production of prostaglandins (pgi2, pge2, etc.) in
the abdominal cavity (deraedt et al., 1980; berkenkopf and
weichman, 1988), which are associated with  xxxg1883xxx  (matsumoto et al., 1998). the cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib did not
inhibit the acetic acid-induced writhing response. this result
supports the involvement of  xxxg1883xxx  in this model. furthermore,
the development of acetic acid-induced writhing responses
involves not only pg but also endogenous bradykinin
(berkenkopf and weichman, 1988) and vr-1 (ikeda et al.,
2001). therefore, the anti-nociceptive effect of zaltoprofen on
the acetic acid-induced response may have developed through
the inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  and of the endogeneous bradykinin-

mediated response. on the other hand, the anti-nociceptive
effects of other nsaids were suggested to be mainly due to the
inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx . the present results were similar to those
of the study reported by rashid et al. (2004b), in which the
active formula of loxoprofen did not inhibit the nociceptive
response induced by intraplantar injection of bradykinin.
the inhibitory effect of zaltoprofen on bradykinin-induced
nociceptive responses cannot be explained only by the
inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  and/or cox-2. bradykinin can directly
activate the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  at the polymodal nociceptor located in
small diameter unmyelinated c-fiber (inoue and ueda, 2000).
so, we focused our attention on the effect of zaltoprofen on the
bradykinin receptor pathway of the primary sensory neuron.
bradykinin receptors are classified into b1 and b2; the b2
receptor is constitutively expressed in normal tissue, whereas
b1 receptor expression is induced after tissue injury, trauma or
following treatment with complete freund’s adjuvant or
cytokines (prado et al., 2002). in the present study, zaltoprofen
showed no affinity to b1 and b2 receptors. therefore, we
examined the effect of zaltoprofen on the bradykinin response
using cultured drg cells. these cells are useful for studying
algesic and/or analgesic substances. it has been reported that
cultured drg cells 25 mm in diameter are primarily c-fiber
neurons and are sensitized by bradykinin (noda et al., 1997). it
has also been reported that drg neurons are sensitized through
transactivation of vr-1 by bradykinin (julius and basbaum,
2001). the apparent increase or oscillation of [ca2+]i in drg
cells induced by bradykinin has also been previously reported
(kuzuoka et al., 2000). in this study, an apparent increase of
[ca2+]i was induced by bradykinin in drg cells. however, the
repetitive treatment with bradykinin did not induce any typical
desensitization. since the bradykinin-induced increase of
[ca2+]i was inhibited by  xxxd862xxx -[hyp3, thi5,8, d-phe7]bradykinin, a b2 antagonist, the reaction was confirmed to
be mediated by b2 receptors. zaltoprofen inhibited the
bradykinin-induced increase of [ca2+]i, even under ca2+-free
conditions. these results suggest that the inhibitory action of
zaltoprofen on the bradykinin-induced increase of [ca2+]i
involves both the inhibition of the influx of extracellular ca2+
and of the release of ca2+ from the intracellular pool. the above
results suggest that zaltoprofen exerts its analgesic effect by
blocking the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx -mediated signaling pathway on the
primary sensory neuron, but not by a direct action on the b2
receptor. bradykinin directly stimulates b2 receptors and
activates various signal pathways including plc, cox and
lox as well as the sensitization of vr-1 via pkc. it has been
demonstrated that an intraplantar injection of bradykinin in
mice induces nociception mediated by non-selective ca2+
channels stimulated by activation of the plc pathway and lox
product formation (ferreira et al., 2004). it has been reported
that zaltoprofen potently inhibits bradykinin-enhancement of
capsaicin-induced 45ca2+ uptake by drg neurons, and it also
significantly inhibits bradykinin-induced 12-lipoxygenase (12lox) activity (tang et al., 2005). these data suggest that the
analgesic effect of zaltoprofen may be mediated through the
inhibition of the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx -mediated responses; that is, coxs
and 12-lox activation.

muratani et al. (2005) have reported the preemptive
analgesic effect of analgesics in a post-operative pain model
produced by a plantar incision. this model did not respond to a
specific  xxxg1883xxx  inhibitor (sc-560) or cox-2 inhibitor
(celecoxib), but responded to a  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  antagonist
( xxxd2317xxx ) and zaltoprofen. these results suggest that
bradykinin plays an important role in the initial stage of pain
development, and the preemptive analgesic effect of zaltoprofen may block the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx -mediated pathway. in addition, it
was demonstrated that zaltoprofen produced a significant
improvement compared with  xxxd2423xxx , in a double-blind
study on post-operative pain and pain after trauma (komatsubara et al., 1991). the effect of zaltoprofen may derive from the
inhibition of cox and the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx -mediated pathway. a
receptor-switching phenomenon in which b2 receptors in the cfiber disappeared with time and new b1 receptors appeared in
the a-fiber has been established in a model of neuropathic pain
(rashid et al., 2004a). with the advances in research on the role
of bradykinin receptors in chronic pain, the indications of
zaltoprofen in the pain control is expected to be extended.
in summary, zaltoprofen showed an inhibitory effect on
bradykinin—as well as acetic acid-induced nociceptive
responses. furthermore, zaltoprofen had no affinity for b1
and b2 receptors and inhibited the bradykinin-induced increase
of [ca2+]i in cultured drg cells. therefore, the mechanism by
which zaltoprofen inhibited the bradykinin-induced nociceptive response may not be associated with a direct action on b2
receptors but with a blockade of the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx -mediated
signaling pathway in the primary sensory neuron. the present
results suggest that zaltoprofen may serve as a potent and
 xxxd2565xxx  for the treatment of pain.
