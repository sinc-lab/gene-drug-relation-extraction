verted into thromboxane a2 by sequential oxygenation of
 xxxd208xxx  by cycloxygenase and  xxxg2254xxx  (1). the released thromboxane a2 acts as a positive
feedback mediator in the activation and recruitment of more
platelets to the primary hemostatic plug (2). thromboxane a2
exerts its actions via specific g protein-coupled receptors and
has been described as either a potent platelet agonist (2, 3) or
as a weak agonist with an important role in amplifying the
response of platelets to more potent agonists (4).
pharmacological studies indicate the presence of two potential  xxxg2253xxx  ( xxxg2253xxx )1 subtypes on human platelets (5, 6). the  xxxg2253xxx  gene has been cloned and
encodes two subtypes of the  xxxg2253xxx  that result from alternative splicing of the primary transcript (7). the subtypes
share the identical first 293 amino acids but possess different
carboxyl-terminal domains. a complete cdna of the 343 amino
acid tpa isoform was isolated from both a placental cdna
library and human megakaryocytic leukemia cells (8, 9) and a
chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (10). a cdna for the
407-amino acid tpb subtype was cloned from a vascular endothelial library (11, 12). both the tpa and tpb subtypes mediate the stimulation of phospholipase c and an increase in
intracellular concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and
diacylglycerol. the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate induces an increase in the cytosolic concentration of ca21,
whereas the release of diacylglycerol activates pkc (13–16). in
transfected cell lines the two subtypes were shown to oppositely regulate levels of camp. the tpa receptor stimulated
camp formation in contrast to the tpb receptor that inhibited
the level of intracellular camp (15). pertussis toxin was shown
to block tpb receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase;
however, its effect on phospholipase c activation was not determined (15). by using isoform-specific antibodies habib et al.
(17) only detected the presence of the tpa receptor in human
platelets. hirata et al. (15) have shown the presence of mrna
encoding both tpa and tpb subtypes in platelets using reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
adp-induced platelet aggregation results from concomitant
signaling through the p2y1 and p2tac receptors that couple to
gq and gi, respectively (18 –21). thrombin has been shown to
activate both gq- and gi-signaling cascades (22, 23). contrary

thromboxane a2 is a positive feedback lipid mediator
produced following platelet activation. the gq-coupled
 xxxg2253xxx  subtype, tpa, and gi-coupled
tpb subtype have been shown in human platelets. adpinduced platelet aggregation requires concomitant signaling from two p2 receptor subtypes, p2y1 and p2tac,
coupled to gq and gi, respectively. we investigated
whether the stable thromboxane a2 mimetic, (15s)-hydroxy-9,11-epoxymethanoprosta-5z,13e-dienoic acid
(u46619), also causes platelet aggregation by concomitant signaling through gq and gi, through co-activation
of tpa and tpb receptor subtypes. here we report that
secretion blockade with ro 31-8220, a protein kinase c
inhibitor, completely inhibited u46619-induced, but not
adp- or thrombin-induced, platelet aggregation. ro 318220 had no effect on u46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization or platelet shape change. furthermore, u46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change were unaffected by  xxxd1570xxx , a
p2y1 receptor-selective antagonist, and/or  xxxd1785xxx , a 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2a receptor antagonist. either ro 31-8220 or ar-c66096, a p2tac receptor
selective antagonist, abolished u46619-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. in addition, ar-c66096 drastically inhibited u46619-mediated platelet aggregation,
which was further inhibited by yohimbine, an a2a-adrenergic receptor antagonist. furthermore, inhibition
of u46619-induced platelet aggregation by ro 31-8220
was relieved by activation of the gi pathway by selective
activation of either the p2tac receptor or the a2a-adrenergic receptor. we conclude that whereas thromboxane
a2 causes intracellular calcium mobilization and shape
change independently, thromboxane a2-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and platelet aggregation depends exclusively upon secretion of other agonists that
stimulate gi-coupled receptors.

to previous studies, we have demonstrated that epinephrine
and serotonin activating only gi or gq pathways, respectively,
are not true platelet-aggregating agents (18). offermanns et al.
(24) have provided evidence showing that u46619 couples to
gq. since thromboxane a2 couples to two  xxxg2253xxx  subtypes
and tpb has been shown to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, we investigated whether u46619 (a stable thromboxane a2 analog) also
causes platelet aggregation by co-activation of tpa and tpb
receptor subtypes coupled to gq and gi, respectively.
we report here that u46619 causes intracellular calcium
mobilization and shape change in human platelets independently of secretion. however, txa2-induced platelet aggregation
depends upon secretion of other platelet agonists capable of
coupling to gi pathways. in the absence of gi signaling by other
agonists, u46619 cannot cause inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or
platelet aggregation. we provide evidence for the involvement
of the p2tac and a2a-adrenergic receptors as well as other
gi-coupled receptors in u46619-induced platelet aggregation.

materials—adenosine-39-phosphate-59-phosphate ( xxxd1570xxx ), epinephrine, apyrase (type v), adp, fibrinogen (type i), and bovine serum
albumin (fraction v) were from sigma. the acetoxymethyl ester of fura
pe-3 was from teflabs (austin, tx). the stable thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue 9,11-dideoxy-9,11-epoxymethanoprostaglandin f2a (u46619) and ro 31-8220 ( xxxd2195xxx  ix) were
from biomol (plymouth meeting, pa). imipramine was purchased from
icn (costa mesa, ca). bovine thrombin was from parke-davis. sc57101 was a gift from searle and co. ar-c66096 (previously known as
arl 66096) was a gift from astra research laboratories-charnwood,
loughborough, uk (formerly fisons). yohimbine and  xxxd1785xxx 
were purchased from research biologicals international (natick, ma).
all other chemicals were reagent grade, and deionized water was used
throughout.
isolation of platelets—human blood was collected from a pool of
informed healthy volunteers all of whom are students or staff at temple
university school of medicine. the donated blood was collected into a
one-sixth volume of acd (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of  xxxd1710xxx , and
2.0 g of glucose in 100 ml of deionized h2o). platelet-rich plasma (prp)
was isolated by centrifugation of citrated blood at 180 3 g for 15 min at
room temperature. prp was incubated with 1 mm  xxxd234xxx 
(aspirin treated) for 1 h at 37 °c followed by centrifugation at 1000 3 g
for 10 min at room temperature. the platelet pellet was resuspended in
hepes-buffered tyrode’s solution (138 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 3.0 mm nah2po4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm hepes, adjusted to ph
7.4) supplemented with 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx , and 0.05 units/ml
apyrase. the platelet count was adjusted to 2 3 108 cells/ml. all experiments were repeated at least three times using platelets from different
donors.
analysis of platelet aggregation and shape change—agonist-induced platelet aggregation was determined by measuring the transmission of light through a 0.5-ml sample of aspirin-treated washed platelets (2 3 108 cells/ml) with stirring (900 rpm) in a lumi-aggregometer at
37 °c (chrono-log, havertown, pa). the recorder output speed was set
to 0.2 mm/s. the base line was set using 0.5 ml of hepes-buffered
tyrode’s solution as a blank. aggregation of washed platelets required
the addition of fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) prior to the addition of an agonist.
platelet shape change was observed by the addition of 1 mm sc-57101
before agonist stimulation. sc-57101 is a known inhibitor of platelet
aggregation through blocking fibrinogen binding to its receptor (25). all
experiments were performed in the presence of 2 mm cacl2 which was
added first before either fibrinogen or sc-57101. all experiments were
repeated at least three times using platelets from different donors.
measurement of platelet secretion—platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of [14c]5-ht and expressed as the
percentage of the total [14c]5-ht content. the activation of labeled
[14c]5-ht platelets was performed in the lumi-aggregometer at 37 °c
with stirring (900 rpm) and was stopped after 2 min with the addition
of formaldehyde/edta according to the method of costa and murphy
(26). imipramine was added to the hepes-buffered tyrode’s solution at
a final concentration of 1 mm in order to prevent re-uptake of secreted
[14c]5-ht. samples were collected and centrifuged at 5000 3 g for 1
min, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was measured using an
lkb (amersham pharmacia biotech) liquid scintillation counter.

tyrode’s solution including 1 mm imipramine to prevent re-uptake of
secreted 5-ht. a, platelet aggregation was measured in the presence of
extracellular fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) and 2 mm cacl2 as described under
“experimental procedures.” aggregation was performed in a cuvette
maintained at 37 °c with stirring. the ordinate represents the observed
changes in light absorbance (optical density) due to light scattering by
the platelets. these tracings are representative of results observed on
three separate occasions from three different donors. b, ro 31-8220 or
 xxxd1896xxx  (control) was added to a 0.5-ml volume of platelets
and incubated for 5 min at 37 °c with stirring before the addition of
u46619. each data point is the mean 6 s.e. of three measurements.
the experiment was repeated three times using platelets from different
donors.
let-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °c with 3 mm fura pe-3 acetoxymethyl ester and 1 mm  xxxd234xxx  for 45 min followed by 15 min
at room temperature. the platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at
1000 3 g for 10 min at room temperature. the platelet pellet was
resuspended in hepes-buffered tyrode’s solution supplemented with
0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx , and 0.05 units/ml apyrase. the platelet
count was adjusted to 2 3 108 cells/ml. aliquots (1.0 ml) of the platelet
suspension were stirred (900 rpm) in a water-jacketed cuvette maintained at 37 °c during activation. fluorescence was constantly measured using a perkin-elmer ls-5 spectrofluorimeter with settings of 340

were calibrated as described previously (27). fmin was determined by
the addition of 2 mm egta, 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx , and 40 mm digitonin. fmax
was determined by addition of a saturating concentration of cacl2 to
the lysed cells. all experiments were performed in the presence of 2 mm
cacl2 and repeated at least three times using platelets from different
donors. calibration curves for experiments that included ro 31-8220
were performed in the presence of ro 31-8220 due to its slight quenching of the fluorescent signal.

effect of ro 31-8220, a protein kinase c inhibitor, on
u46619-induced platelet responses—platelets respond to increasing concentrations of adp by first undergoing shape
change and then, at a higher concentrations, aggregation (29).
this is because adp-induced platelet shape change results
from activation of the high affinity p2y1 receptor (19), and
higher concentrations of adp are needed for co-stimulation of
both the high affinity p2y1 receptor and a low affinity p2tac
receptor to induce aggregation (19). in order to determine if
concomitant higher affinity gq-coupled signaling and lower
affinity gi-coupled signaling also occurs in response to u46619
and to determine whether aggregation requires lower concentration of u46619 than secretion, we exposed platelets to different concentrations of the agonist. similar to the response
observed for adp, the platelets first responded to lower concentrations of u46619 (100 nm) by changing shape. aggregation occurred at significantly higher concentrations (300 nm)
(fig. 1a). secretion did not occur at concentrations of u46619
below 300 nm (fig. 1b); furthermore, the onset of aggregation
appears to correlate with the initiation of secretion. pkc has
been shown to play an important role in the induction of platelet secretion, and secretion can be blocked using the cell-permeable inhibitor of pkc, ro 31-8220 (30 –32). we investigated
the role of secretion in platelet aggregation in response to adp,
thrombin, and u46619. secretion in response to u46619 is
totally abolished by 10 mm ro 31-8220 (fig. 1b). in the presence
of ro 31-8220, u46619 caused shape change but did not induce
aggregation (fig. 2). platelet aggregation induced by thrombin

was slightly slowed down indicating the participation of secreted agonists, whereas aggregation in response to adp was
unaffected (fig. 2).
effect of ro 31-8220 on u46619-induced gq-coupled platelet
responses—adp-mediated gq-coupled signaling has been
shown to be required for both platelet shape change and aggregation (19, 28). stimulation of the  xxxg2253xxx  with 30 –100 nm
u46619 leads to platelet shape change resembling selective
stimulation of the gq-coupled p2y1 receptor. in order to assess
the possible effects of secretion on gq-mediated signaling, both
platelet shape change and intracellular ca21 mobilization were
measured in the presence and absence of ro 31-8220, a protein
kinase c (pkc) inhibitor. platelet shape change in response to
u46619 was not affected by ro 31-8220 (fig. 3a) indicating
that these signaling pathways are not dependent upon either
secretion or pkc activity. furthermore, the u46619-induced
increase in cytosolic ca21 was unaffected by the presence of ro
31-8220 (fig. 3b) indicating that gq-coupled signaling initiated
by  xxxg2253xxx  stimulation is independent of released granule
contents.
effect of receptor-selective antagonists on u46619-induced
gq-coupled platelet responses—platelet secretion releases

adp and serotonin at the site of injury in order to activate and
recruit more platelets into the forming primary hemostatic
plug (2). by using receptor-selective antagonists, we investigated the contribution of these agonists to u46619-induced
gq-coupled responses. the compound  xxxd1570xxx  is an antagonist
of the gq-coupled p2y1 receptor (33).  xxxd1785xxx  is an
antagonist at the  xxxg1113xxx  (34 –37). aggregation was
not affected by the presence of either compound (data not
shown). u46619-induced platelet shape change was not affected by the presence of  xxxd1570xxx  (fig. 4a) or  xxxd1785xxx 
(not shown) indicating the lack of any contribution by the p2y1
or serotonin receptors to this event. the possible contribution
of both the p2y1 and 5-ht2a receptors in the mobilization of
intracellular ca21 was investigated. intracellular ca21 mobilization in response to u46619 was not affected by  xxxd1570xxx 
and/or  xxxd1785xxx  (fig. 4b).
effect of ro 31-8220 or receptor-selective antagonists on
u46619-induced inhibition of platelet adenylyl cyclase—previous studies have shown that u46619 causes a decrease in the
intracellular concentration of camp in platelets (38, 39). in
order to determine whether tp receptors can couple to gisignaling pathways, we utilized two approaches. the first was
to block secretion using ro 31-8220. in the absence of ro
31-8220, u46619 inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase (fig. 5). in the presence of ro 31-8220, u46619 failed to
inhibit adenylyl cyclase. the second approach utilized receptorselective antagonists to the p2tac and a2a-adrenergic receptors. ar-c66096 is an antagonist at the gi-coupled p2tac
receptor (28), and yohimbine is an antagonist at the gi-coupled
a2-adrenergic receptor (40, 41). platelet dense granules contain
both adp and epinephrine which cause the inhibition of camp
following activation at their respective receptors (2). the level
of camp was measured following stimulation of platelets in the
absence and presence of the antagonists ar-c66096 and yohimbine. these antagonists effectively prevented the contribution of gi-coupled signaling by either the p2tac or the a2aadrenergic receptor, respectively. as shown in fig. 5, u46619induced adenylyl cyclase inhibition was also blocked by these
receptor antagonists, suggesting that u46619-induced gi stimulation depends on secreted adp and epinephrine.

mechanism of u46619-induced platelet aggregation

effect of receptor-selective antagonists on u46619-induced
platelet aggregation—we (18) and others (20, 21) have provided evidence that concomitant signaling through both gicoupled and gq-coupled receptors is required for platelet aggregation. since the  xxxg2253xxx  does not couple to gi,
independently of secreted adp and epinephrine (fig. 5), we
utilized receptor-selective antagonists to elucidate the role of
these gi-coupled receptors in u46619-induced platelet aggregation. ar-c66096 dramatically inhibited adp-induced platelet aggregation (18, 28). the rate and extent of u46619-induced
aggregation were diminished in the presence of ar-c66096
(fig. 6). in the presence of ar-c66096, yohimbine further inhibited u46619-induced platelet aggregation (fig. 6). however,
yohimbine alone was without any significant effect (not
shown). these results indicated that the p2tac receptor is
essential for u46619-induced platelet aggregation.
restoration of u46619-induced aggregation blocked by ro
31-8220 —in order to verify that signaling through a gi-coupled
receptor only occurs following u46619-induced secretion, we
investigated the effects of selective activation of gi-coupled
receptor stimulation in the presence of ro 31-8220. control
experiments were performed to ensure that platelets respond
normally to adp and thrombin in the presence of ro 31-8220 or
vehicle (not shown). the p2tac receptor was selectively activated by adp in the presence of  xxxd1570xxx . as shown in fig. 7,
selective activation of the p2tac receptor reversed the effects of
secretion blockade on u46619-induced aggregation. arc66096 blocked this reversal, providing further evidence that
adp is selectively activating the gi-coupled p2tac receptor
(fig. 7). epinephrine also reversed the inhibitory effects of ro
31-8220 on u46619-induced aggregation. addition of adp and
epinephrine together potentiated this reversal. thus platelet
aggregation in response to u46619 is mediated by concomitant
signaling through the gq-coupled  xxxg2253xxx  and the gi-coupled p2tac and a2a receptors.
discussion

the molecular mechanisms leading to aggregation following
platelet exposure to thromboxane a2 have yet to be clearly

fig. 6. effect of the p2tac antagonist, ar-c66096, and the
a2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, on u46619-induced platelet aggregation. platelet aggregation was measured as described previously. the arrows indicate the addition of 1 mm ar-c66096 or 10 mm
yohimbine into a cuvette maintained at 37 °c with stirring. 2 mm

elucidated. four explanations for the stimulatory action caused
by u46619 or other thromboxane a2 mimetics are possible.
first, u46619 may activate gq and gi through the tpa and
tpb receptors, respectively. second, it is conceivable that
u46619 only activates the gq pathway and that secreted adp
activates the gi pathway. although unlikely, a third explanation is that u46619 activates gi or go through tpb leading to
the activation of phospholipase c and the inhibition of cyclase.
following secretion, released adp would activate the gq pathway. finally, u46619 may activate an unidentified g proteincoupled pathway that results in secretion of adp which activates both gq and gi through the p2y1 and the p2tac
receptors, respectively. we used three complementary approaches to identify the molecular mechanisms of u46619induced platelet activation as follows: 1) determination of the
minimum concentration required for platelet aggregation and
secretion by u46619, 2) blockade of secretion, and 3) receptor
subtype-selective antagonists in order to eliminate the positive
feedback from granule contents. here we report that although
thromboxane a2 causes intracellular calcium mobilization and
shape change independently, thromboxane a2-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and platelet aggregation depend exclusively on adp and other released granule contents.
evidence exists for a dissociation of platelet activation responses following stimulation of the  xxxg2253xxx . first, the
ec50 values of the  xxxg2253xxx  agonists, u46619 (42) and sta2
(43), for an increase in cytosolic ca21 and platelet shape change
are lower than the ec50 values for secretion and aggregation.
our data indicate that platelet aggregation correlates with the
occurrence of secretion. we observed that platelet shape
change occurs at lower concentrations of u46619 and that
aggregation occurs at higher concentrations (fig. 1a). furthermore, the same concentration of u46619 that leads to the
initiation of aggregation also initiates secretion (fig. 1b). however, from this evidence it is not clear if platelet aggregation
results in part from p2 receptor stimulation.
substantial evidence exists that pkc activation is required
for platelet secretion (31). in platelets activated by u46619 in
the presence of ro 31-8220, it was reported that p47 phosphorylation, fibrinogen binding, and serotonin release were all
inhibited (32). in agreement with previous studies, our results
show that ro 31-8220 prevented u46619-induced platelet aggregation (fig. 2). we observed that ro 31-8220 inhibited
u46619-induced secretion in platelets loaded with [14c]serotonin in the presence of 2 mm ca21 (fig. 1b) and that ro 31-8220
did not inhibit the increase in cytosolic ca21 induced by
u46619 (fig. 3b).
ro 31-8220 failed to inhibit adp- or thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (fig. 3) suggesting that the ro 31-8220 inhibitable pkc isoforms do not directly contribute to fibrinogen
receptor activation. ro 31-8220 has been shown to block pkc
isoforms a, b, g, and e (44). hence these pkc isoforms do not
contribute to the inside-out signaling leading to fibrinogen
receptor activation by either adp or thrombin.
considering that secretion and aggregation both occur at the
same concentration of u46619 (fig. 1) and that blocking secretion prevents aggregation (fig. 2), it is reasonable to suggest
that thromboxane a2-induced aggregation is dependent upon
secretion. the role of adp in thromboxane a2-induced platelet
aggregation has been investigated using enzymes that deplete
released adp. this work suggested that the aggregation response is mediated by the secretion of platelet adp (45– 49). it
was concluded that u46619-induced platelet aggregation depends on the release of stored adp. the use of apyrase could
have enhanced the generation of adenosine from amp. adenosine binds to the gs-coupled a2 receptor resulting in an in-

mechanism of u46619-induced platelet aggregation

platelet aggregation was measured as described. aspirated platelets were previously treated with either vehicle ( xxxd1896xxx ) and are labeled control or
with 10 mm ro 31-8220 as indicated. antagonists added before u46619 are indicated above tracings. the arrows indicate
the addition of 1 mm u46619, 10 mm adp,

crease in the intracellular concentration of camp and inhibits
platelet activation (50, 51). moreover, these studies did not
clearly determine how adp and the other components of the
dense and a-granules contribute to txa2-induced platelet aggregation. the use of creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase converts adp to atp, an antagonist at the platelet adp
receptors (2). atp can also potentially stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity resulting in inhibition of platelet activation (52,
53). our experiments make use of the receptor subtype-selective antagonists ar-c66096 and yohimbine, which block stimulation of gi signaling.
evidence exists to support the presence of the tpa and tpb
receptor subtypes in platelets (8, 17); these isoforms, when
expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells, have been shown to
couple to gs and gi pathways, respectively. however, in the
presence of ro 31-8220, high concentrations of u46619 did not
alter the level of camp, indicating that  xxxg2253xxx  subtypes do
not couple to adenylyl cyclase in platelets. our observation also
is supported by two studies. by using platelet membranes,
u46619 was found to have no effect upon levels of camp (54).
furthermore, klages et al. (55) have shown that u46619 does
not stimulate gi proteins in mouse platelets. g protein coupling

may be affected by levels of heterologous receptor expression;
futhermore, high levels of receptor expression can lead to promiscuous coupling to multiple g proteins.
u46619-induced aggregation requires concomitant stimulation of both a gq-coupled receptor and a gi-coupled receptor.
granule contents appear to mediate the stimulation of gicoupled signaling as is evident by the lack of cyclase inhibition
when u46619-induced platelet secretion is prevented (fig. 5).
the fact that signaling through the gq-coupled  xxxg2253xxx  is
unaffected under such conditions is apparent by both the robust shape change response (fig. 3a) and the normal level of
cytosolic ca21 mobilization (fig. 3b).
an alternative explanation for the effect of ro 31-8220 on
u46619-induced platelet aggregation is that u46619 causes
platelet aggregation involving activation of a pkc isoform
through a mechanism different from that of adp. hence, ro
31-8220 would inhibit u46619-induced aggregation by inhibiting this pkc isoform in addition to blocking secretion. this
possibility was ruled out using receptor-selective antagonists.
through the use of receptor-selective antagonists, we were
able to identify clearly the contribution of receptors mediating
aggregation following u46619-induced secretion. antagonists
at gq-coupled receptors such as  xxxd1785xxx  and  xxxd1570xxx  had
no effect on aggregation, shape change, or the increase in
cytosolic ca21 concentration. in contrast, both of the gi-coupled
p2tac and a2a-adrenergic receptors were found to mediate
aggregation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, following
u46619-induced secretion (fig. 6). the compound ar-c66096
had the greatest inhibitory effect indicating the large contribution to gi-coupled signaling by the p2tac receptor. in the
absence of ar-c66096, yohimbine failed to affect u46619-induced aggregation, indicating that gi stimulation could be compensated by p2tac receptor stimulation. the amount of epinephrine found in platelets is extremely small (1.1–3.8 pmol/
1 3 108 platelets) (56); however, the initial concentration of this
secreted amount in the microenvironment of the platelet could
be much greater. as observed, the secreted epinephrine makes
a significant contribution as revealed by the inhibition of aggregation by yohimbine only in the absence of p2tac receptor
stimulation (fig. 6). this suggests that secretion of the gicoupled receptor stimulating agonists (adp and epinephrine)
are required for full aggregation following activation of gqcoupled signaling by thromboxane a2. when u46619-induced
secretion was blocked by ro 31-8220 aggregation was pre-

vented. under these conditions the selective activation of either
the gi-coupled p2tac receptor or the a2a-adrenergic receptor
restored aggregation (fig. 7).
further evidence for the important role of the p2tac receptor in mediating the platelet response to txa2 is provided by
reports of patients with congenital adp receptor defects (57–
59). in these cases the shape change and cytosolic ca21 mobilization responses to adp are present indicating function of the
p2y1 receptor, whereas adp-induced aggregation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase are absent. such findings suggest that
the defect involves the p2tac receptor. the lack of signaling
due to a defective p2tac receptor affects the response of these
platelets to thromboxane a2 mimetics. in both cases, u46619induced activation of the integrin aiibb3 was inhibited (58, 59).
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by epinephrine in platelets from
both patients was normal, suggesting that the residual fibrinogen receptor activation could be due to activation of a2aadrenergic receptors by secreted epinephrine. on the other
hand, we predict that in the case of a hypothetical p2y1 receptor defect, platelet aggregation in response to u46619 would
appear normal as gi stimulation, although the p2tac receptor
and the a2-adrenergic receptor would be intact.
even in the presence of both ar-c66096 and yohimbine we
still observed some residual aggregation (fig. 6). we propose
that this residual aggregation results from gi signaling by
other components of the granules. this prediction is supported
by the fact that secretion blockade completely eliminates
u46619-induced platelet aggregation. based on previous and
recent reports describing the mechanism of action by thrombospondin, a major constituent of the a granules, in platelet
activation and aggregation (60 – 62), we suggest that it too may
be mediating txa2 mimetic-induced aggregation. a recent
study has demonstrated that thrombospondin can stimulate
the gi-signaling pathways (60).
in conclusion, as outlined in fig. 8, our results show that
u46619 causes platelet shape change and intracellular ca21
mobilization independently of secreted granule contents. however, u46619-induced platelet aggregation depends exclusively
on gi stimulation by adp and other released granule contents.
the p2tac receptor appears to be the predominant stimulator
of the gi pathway. these results further support the hypothesis
that platelet fibrinogen receptor activation requires concomitant signaling from the gq- and gi-signaling pathways.
