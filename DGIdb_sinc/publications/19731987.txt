the authors present the case of a patient that demonstrates the long-standing use of  xxxd2557xxx , a progesterone agonist, and its association with multiple intracranial meningioma presentation. discontinuation of  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate led to shrinkage of multiple tumors and to the complete resolution of one tumor. histological examination
demonstrated that the largest tumor had high (by > 25% of tumor cell nuclei) progesterone-positive expression,
including  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) isoform b, compared with low expression of pr isoform a; there was no evidence of  xxxg730xxx  expression and only unaccentuated collagen expression. this is the first clinical report
illustrating a causal relationship between exogenous hormones and modulation of meningioma biology in situ.

growing number of reports have illustrated the
association of exogenous hormones in patients
with meningiomas.3,7,14,17 despite decreasing use
of direct hormone replacement therapy in menopausal
women, increasing use of exogenous hormones, including oral contraceptives, remains prevalent.3 the fact that
intracranial meningiomas arise in women at almost 2
times the incidence in men,10 along with modulation of
meningioma biology during pregnancy, suggests a plausible link.1
large reviews comparing hormone therapy and
meningioma presentation have found no statistical significance, but have found an association. what is clear,
however, is the identification of progesterone and estrogen expression in laboratory studies and the gross classification of meningiomas with prognostic indications.
pravdenkova et al.15 demonstrated that meningiomas with
positive progesterone expression had low proliferative indices and were karyotypically stable, compared with prnegative or er-positive meningioma tissue. these latter
groups were associated with greater proliferative indices
and were more likely to have karyotype instability. the
er-positive group, uniquely, demonstrated a greater genetic association with chromosomes 14 and 22.
what is not clear is the biological behavior of meningiomas in response to pr activity, clinically. no study has
shown that the application of exogenous hormone use and

abbreviations used in this paper: er =  xxxg730xxx ; pr =
 xxxg1737xxx ; pra = pr isoform a; prb = pr isoform b.

its withdrawal could modulate the functional biology of
a meningioma. furthermore, no study has demonstrated
what type of meningioma may prove susceptible. here
in a single case, we report on a patient in whom longterm use of  xxxd2557xxx  was associated with the
appearance of multiple meningiomas. after discontinuation of  xxxd2557xxx , we found regression of multiple tumors. we suggest a causal clinical link between
the application of exogenous hormones and meningioma
biology in situ.

case report

this 63-year-old, right-handed, postmenopausal
wom­an presented with 3 months of progressively worsening headaches. she had a history of breast carcinoma
treated with mastectomy, after which she was maintained
on  xxxd2557xxx  (40 mg, 4 times daily) for > 7 years.
neurological examination revealed no focal deficits. her
outpatient evaluation included contrast-enhanced mr
imaging studies demonstrating evidence for 5 intracranial meningiomas (fig. 1). due to her symptomatic presentation, medical and surgical options for the largest lesion (at the right sphenoid wing) were discussed at that
time. we discontinued her progesterone agonist therapy.
a day later we partially embolized the largest lesion, and
we surgically removed it the following day. the patient
was initially neurologically intact after surgery, but severe brain swelling on the 1st postoperative day led to a
temporal lobectomy. she recovered well afterward.

histological examination of surgically removed tissue revealed features consistent with who grade i transitional meningioma. the tumor demonstrated high expression (by > 25%) for pr, and a lack of er expression,
with an overall minimal associated expression of collagen. we further evaluated the tissue for expression of pr
isotype a versus b. we found high prb expression (by >
25%) versus low pra expression (fig. 2).
follow-up mr imaging demonstrated early reduction in size of multiple tumors (table 1), including the
multiple tumors for which no operation was performed
(fig. 3). at her most recent follow-up visit 5 years postoperatively, and after discontinuation of  xxxd2557xxx ,
mr imaging demonstrated a marked reduction in size in
her multiple meningiomas and no appearance of the right
parasagittal lesion.

discussion

this is the first case in which a causal relationship
has been reported between an exogenous hormone and
meningioma in situ. here we illustrate the combination of
long-term  xxxd2557xxx  use and the late appearance
of multiple intracranial meningiomas. after discontinuation of hormone therapy, we found serial regression in
tumor volume, even to the point of radiographic absence
of one tumor. we further characterized the surgically removed tissue for histological markers to help elucidate
the biological responsiveness of these meningiomas to
pr activity.
in breast cancer, clinical applications of  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate include second-line hormonal therapy despite
use of tamoxifen (selective er antagonist); additionally,

progesterone agonist activity is used to treat uterine and
prostate cancer cell proliferation. few clinical reports
have demonstrated an association between progesterone
agonist therapy and clinical outcomes in meningioma.
grunberg et al.8 initially concluded that pr expression
could be down-regulated in a human tumor stem cell clonogenic assay after exposure to continuous progesterone
agonist therapy. they then recruited 9 patients presenting
with various intracranial meningiomas to receive  xxxd2557xxx  for 1–12 months. seven patients responded
to the intervention with progressive or new neurological
symptoms, whereas 2 had constant symptoms and increased weight gain. in all 9 patients, the progesterone
agonist therapy was discontinued.9
few case reports have emerged illustrating an association between the presentation of meningiomas and
extended progesterone agonist use. piper et al.14 found a
sphenoid wing meningioma that presented in a patient
after her 4-week use of an intrauterine contraceptive in
which levonorgestrel was a component, but 6 weeks after discontinuation of therapy, her initial symptoms progressed and her tumor was subsequently resected. gruber
et al.7 reported on a patient requiring  xxxd2557xxx 
for 19 years and presenting with 11 intracranial meningiomas. unfortunately, 6 weeks after discontinuing the
progesterone agonist, her symptoms progressed, with an
increase in tumor size. however, shimizu et al.17 reported
on a patient with a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy who was treated with several years’ use of chlormadinone acetate (a progesterone agonist), and in whom a
lesion suggestive of meningioma was found incidentally
on radiological studies. the patient was observed without radiographic change for 9 months and subsequently

switched to naftopidil (an alpha 1 blocker) when he was
found to have regression of radiographic tumor volume 33
months later, and at his 4-year follow-up visit he had no
further progression.
in our case, we surgically removed the largest lesion due to its association with a significant symptomatic presentation. we presume, however, that this lesion
over time may have responded similarly to the other 4
intracranial meningioma lesions. it is unclear whether the
regression seen here is associated with an unknown underlying genetic predisposition to malignancy, as can be
seen with the reported predilection in men and japanese
women with premature aging diseases, such as werner
syndrome.13
only recently has the pr been identified to present

in selective structural isoforms with a distinct functional
difference; pra at 83 kd binds with less cooperative
binding ability and intrinsic binding affinity than prb
at 99 kd.5 differential affinities explain, at least in part,
how prb is considered to operate as the dominant receptor activator versus pra’s global repressive activity
of several steroid hormone receptors, including repressive
activity against prb (fig. 4).18
in the cns, human chordomas, astrocytomas,
schwannomas, and meningiomas express both pra and
prb. resected specimens evaluated for pr isoforms have
shown predominance of prb in 6 chordoma cases, 2 26
(grade unspecified)11 or 13 astrocytomas (grades iii and
iv),6 and 16 schwannoma cases.11 meningiomas, however,
have demonstrated varying pr isoform expression. inoue

et al.11 found no significant differences between pra and
prb expression, but interestingly enough, discovered
pra expression in the 35 meningiomas to express significantly greater than astrocytomas and schwannomas.
verheijen et al.19 evaluated 61 pr-positive meningiomas
and suggested greater pr ligand binding with pra than
with prb expression (this was found in 66% of various
meningioma subtypes). it remains unclear what association pra and prb have with the aggressiveness of meningioma grades, and in a broad view, which isoform and
gradation of meningioma subtype contributes to a meningioma becoming clinically responsive to pr manipulation.
our report agrees with recent studies examining
genetic correlations that have been made between histological grade and  xxxg1603xxx  expression of meningiomas. pravdenkova et al.15 suggested that patients
whose meningiomas had higher expression of pr were
less likely to have tumor recurrence, and would have lower
who grades, fewer karyotypic abnormalities, and lower
proliferative indices. in our study, we found a transitional
(who grade i) meningioma with high expression of pr,
including higher prb than pra, and no estrogen expression. we also found collagen to be expressed in an intermediate role, as expected with pr-positive, transitional
meningiomas.4 the prb predominance presented here
j neurosurg / volume 112 / may 2010

may have important prognostic implications, because
prb has been shown to be an independent survival factor
in patients with endometrial cancer and to have significant molecular control over breast cancer cell proliferation.12,16 an imbalance favoring greater prb expression in
light of less expression of inhibitory pra may allow for
cell cycle progression, which may help explain our findings.19 the clinical responsiveness of heavily prb-positive meningioma seen in our patient suggests that benign
meningiomas may be responsive to hormonal blockading
therapies, and further promotes the concept that therapies
directed against the pr may prove to be another approach
to modulating meningioma growth.

conclusions

this is the first report to identify a causal link between
exogenous progesterone agonist therapy and meningioma
biology in situ. the fact that prb was the predominant
functional isoform expressed may have important prognostic implications for identifying which patients with
meningioma are uniquely susceptible to hormonal regulation. further studies evaluating progesterone antagonist
blockade of the pr may prove to be a pragmatic approach
for clinical control of meningioma progression.
