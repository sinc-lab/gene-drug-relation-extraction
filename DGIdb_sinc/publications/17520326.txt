summary. the effects of dioxygen on  xxxg2276xxx  (th) activity
was studied, measuring the formation of dopa from tyrosine, 3 h2 o from
3,5-3h-tyrosine, or by direct oxygraphic determination of oxygen consumption. a high enzyme activity was observed during the initial 1–2 min
of the reactions, followed by a decline in activity, possibly related to a
turnover dependent substoichiometrical oxidation of enzyme bound fe(ii)
to the inactive fe(iii) state. during the initial reaction phase, apparent
km-values of 29–45 mm for dioxygen were determined for all human th
isoforms, i.e. 2–40 times higher than previously reported for th isolated
from animal tissues. after 8 min incubation, the km (o2)-values had declined to an average of 20  4 mm. thus, th activity may be severely
limited by oxygen availability even at moderate hypoxic conditions, and the
enzyme is rapidly and turnover dependent inactivated at the experimental
conditions commonly employed to measure in vitro activities.

introduction
 xxxg2276xxx  (th) catalyzes the initial and ratelimiting step in the biosynthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. th
is highly homologous in terms of both protein sequence
and catalytic mechanism to  xxxg1660xxx 
(pah) and tryptophan hydroxylase (tph). in the th reaction, dioxygen, l-tyrosine, and tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4)
are converted to  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa)
and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin (4aoh-bh4) (eq. (1))
(haavik and flatmark, 1987). the 4a-hydroxytetrahy-

drobiopterin rapidly dehydrates either enzymatically or
nonenzymatically to form the slightly more stable quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (q-bh2) (haavik and flatmark,
1983). based on steady-state kinetic studies of the recombinant rat th catalyzed reaction, a sequential reaction mechanism has been proposed with an ordered
binding of tetrahydrobiopterin, dioxygen and then tyrosine (fitzpatrick, 1991).

all aromatic amino acid hydroxylases contain a single
atom of non-heme iron per enzyme subunit. the structure
of the iron site in th has been studied by spectroscopy
(meyer-klaucke et al., 1996) and by x-ray crystallography (goodwill et al., 1997).
human and animal studies have demonstrated that deficiency in any of the three th substrates can be rate limiting under certain physiological or pathological conditions.
a defective dopa production due to congenital bh4 deficiency (thony and blau, 2006) may be treated with dietary bh4 supplementation. accumulation of phenylalanine,
as occurs in phenylketonuria, will competitively inhibit
the transport of tyrosine into the brain and also directly
inhibit the th reaction. thus, tyrosine supplementation
may partially alleviate the toxic effects of phenylalanine
(koch, 1996). several studies have demonstrated a decreased biosynthesis of catecholamines and serotonin in the
nervous system of animals subjected to hypoxia (davis,
1976; hayashi et al., 1990). however, it is not clear
whether this reduction is directly related to substrate depletion of the enzyme and how the environmental dioxygen

levels translate into in vivo oxygen concentrations in catecholaminergic cells.
in previous kinetic studies of th from different mammalian species, a wide range of values for its oxygen affinity have been reported, i.e. km-values of 2–16 mmhg,
corresponding to dioxygen concentrations of 3–24 mm at
25  c and normobaric pressure (ikeda et al., 1966; fisher
and kaufman, 1972; numata et al., 1977; katz, 1980;
fitzpatrick, 1991), but higher km-values have been reported when synthetic analogues of bh4 were used as
electron donors in the th reaction (fisher and kaufman,
1972). thus, estimated km-values for o2 vary by a factor
of more than 20. similarly, uncertainties exist regarding
the tissue partial pressures of oxygen in living animals.
still, it is clear that at sea level the oxygen tensions in rat
brain, kidney and liver (feinsilver et al., 1987; rolett
et al., 2000) may approach the km levels suggested for
rat th and potentially be rate limiting. smith et al. (1977)
reported oxygen tension values in the cortex of rabbit
brain between 7 and 30 mm during normoxic conditions
and rolett et al. (2000) found an oxygen concentration of
20 mm in rat brain. thus, at high altitude, the partial oxygen tension in peripheral tissue of humans most probably
will reach levels in the range of the km-values of rat th,
especially in subjects not fully acclimatized.
the effects of dioxygen on human th (hth) have previously not been studied, neither on the isolated enzyme
nor in intact systems. hth exists as four different isoforms (hth1-hth4) generated by alternative splicing of
pre-mrna (grima et al., 1987). all isoenzymes have been
synthesized in e. coli and characterized (haavik et al.,
1991). the present kinetic study of human th represents
the first quantitative study of the effects of dioxygen concentration on its enzymatic activity, with particular emphasis on the range of oxygen tensions that may occur in
human tissues.
using three different assay procedures, we demonstrate
that the km-values for dioxygen for the purified th isoforms are unexpectedly high, suggesting a direct role of
tissue hypoxia in the regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis. similarly, using intact rat pheochromocytoma
(pc12 cells), we also found that the in situ th activity
decreased immediately upon reduction of the ambient
dioxygen concentration.
materials and methods
materials
argon (99.996%) and oxygen=nitrogen mixtures of the following defined
concentrations (% volume) were purchased from hydro gas (rjukan,

norway): 0.103  0.002, 0.517  0.01, 0.982  0.02, 1.96  0.04,
5.09  0.10, 21.0  0.42 and 100  2% dioxygen. intermediate concentrations of dioxygen were prepared by mixing these basic gases. the final
solution oxygen concentrations were verified by oxymetric measurements
(fossbakk and haavik, 2005).  xxxd3166xxx  (bh4) was purchased from dr. b. schircks laboratories, switzerland, while all other reagents used were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma, st. louis,
mo, usa. hth isoforms 1, 3 and 4 (hth1, hth3, hth4) were synthesized in e. coli and purified to homogeneity (haavik et al., 1991). bovine
th (bth) was purified from the cytosolic fraction of adrenal medulla
extracts (haavik et al., 1988). the concentration of purified th was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm as described (haavik et al., 1988).
human  xxxg1660xxx  (hpah) was synthesized in e. coli and
purified as described (knappskog et al., 1993).
radiochemical assay of th activity
th activity was measured as described by fitzpatrick et al. (1990). reactions were performed in 2 ml stirred glass vials with septum, containing
0.5 ml reaction mixture. the solutions were evacuated before use and
flushed with the desired gas mixture for 15 min at 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, or
37  c before addition of 3 ml th (0.13 mg  ml1 ) through the septum
(0.78 mg  ml1 final conc.). the enzyme was preincubated on ice with
10 mm fe(ii) ammonium sulfate for 30 min. in other experiments the
reactions were performed in 1 ml vials containing 400 ml reaction mixture.
at 20–30 sec intervals, 50 ml samples were removed and assayed for
formation of 3 h2 o by liquid scintillation counting or dopa by highperformance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection (haavik
and flatmark, 1980). the assay mixture contained 200 mm bh4, 2 mm
dithiothreitol, 4–105 mm fe(ii) ammonium sulfate, 0.1–0.5 mg  ml1
catalase, and 25 mm or 50 mm tyrosine in 40 mm na-hepes ph 7.0.
oxygraphic measurements
oxygraphic assays of th and pah activities were carried out in a highresolution respirometer (oroboros oxygraph, innsbruck, austria) (gnaiger
et al., 1995) at 30 and 25  c. for th assays, the initial tyrosine concentrations were 25 or 50 mm, while pah was assayed using 500 mm phenylalanine (fossbakk and haavik, 2005). concentrated enzyme was preincubated for 15 min in a mixture containing the final concentrations of assay
components, but without cofactor, before the reaction was initiated by
injection of 3–20 ml enzyme into the reaction mixture. initial oxygen concentrations were varied by adding pure argon into the gas phase of the
partially opened oxygraph chamber. the chamber was then closed for
recording chemical oxygen consumption before the reaction was initiated
by addition of enzyme. the final th subunit concentrations were 23–
52 mg  ml1 . in some control experiments, the reaction was started by injection of the cofactor bh4, with the enzyme already present in the reaction chamber. the exponential time constant of the polarographic oxygen
sensors in different chambers ranged between 3.2 and 4.4 sec, and was used
for deconvolution of the recorded data (gnaiger et al., 1995). dioxygen
concentration was digitally recorded at time intervals of 1 or 2 sec. reaction
rates were calculated as the negative time derivatives of dioxygen concentration and corrected for the linear oxygen dependence of instrumental
background. enzyme catalyzed reaction rates, vo2 (nmol  min1  ml1 ),
were further corrected for chemical background owing to autoxidation
of the incubation medium containing substrates and cofactors without enzyme. the typical background oxidation of the incubation medium was
approximately 4.52  0.258 nmol  min1  ml1 when the oxygen concentration was 240 mm, where autoxidation of bh4 could account for
3.52  0.43 nmol  min1  ml1 , dtt 0.62  0.11 nmol  min1  ml1 ,
and free fe(ii) for 0.41  0.18 nmol  min1  ml1 (all data are presented
as means  sem, n ¼ 4). by reducing the initial concentration of fe(ii)
from 100 mm used in conventional th assays to 4 mm, its background
activity was reduced ten-fold (fossbakk and haavik, 2005).

 xxxg2276xxx  kinetics
tyrosine did not contribute significantly to the background oxidation,
but seems to have a stabilizing effect and lower the autoxidation of dtt.
background corrections of reaction rates were performed at each oxygen
concentration over the entire experimental oxygen range. chemical background oxygen consumption was also a linear function of dioxygen concentration, with the intercept not significantly different from zero. the
linear regression, therefore, was forced through zero, yielding a slope of
10.8 pmol  min1  ml1 =mm o2 that was used in the calculations.

from two dishes were resuspended in 2.5 ml medium and transferred to an
oxygraph chamber. the oxygen concentration in the oxygraph chamber
was varied by adding argon to the open chamber. experiments were performed in oxygen concentrations in the range of 20–200 mm dioxygen.
aliquots of 50 and 200 ml were removed and assayed for formation of
3
h2 o by liquid scintillation counting.

results
analysis of oxygraphic enzyme kinetics
the derivative of the o2 consumption curve obtained from the oxygraph
was used to obtain values for enzymatic activities at different times after
addition of enzyme. background consumption of o2 was subtracted before
analysis was performed. the enzyme activity was measured at different
oxygen concentrations. a maximum rate was observed immediately after
addition of the enzyme, followed by a rapid decline of enzyme activity to a
lower but constant level. for calculations of km and kcat at different times,
the enzyme activity at the given time was plotted against initial o2 concentration and the data was fitted by a hyperbolic michaelis-menten equation. for accurate determination of the initial rate, we used the experimental data including the data point with maximal activity and the following ones up to 3 min after addition of enzyme. these data points were
used to obtain the activity at the time of enzyme addition by fitting to an
exponential decay equation (eq. (2)), where vt is the observed rate at time
t, vha reaction rate in the ‘high-activity’ state, vla the reaction rate in the
‘low-activity’ state and k the decay constant.

different concentrations of dioxygen on the hth1 activity

for all enzymes, aliquots of 10 ml were removed at selected time intervals, mixed with 40 ml ice cold ethanol containing 1 m acetic acid, centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was injected into an agilent 1100
hplc chromatographic system with fluorimetric detection for determination of tyrosine, 5-oh-tryptophan, and l-dopa (haavik and flatmark,
1980). in some experiments, an intrinsic standard was added to the reaction mixture (1.0 mm 5-oh-tryptophan in the pah assay) to increase the
precision of the hplc analysis (fossbakk and haavik, 2005).
nadh coupled assay of th activity
the effect of iron chelators on the activity of hth was determined using a
coupled assay with  xxxg1912xxx . the assay mixture contained 200 mm bh4, 0.45 units  ml1 sheep  xxxg1912xxx ,
190 mm nadh, 4 mm fe(ii) ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mg  ml1 catalase,
and 50 mm tyrosine in 40 mm na-hepes ph 7.0. the assay mixture was
allowed to equilibrate at 25  c before hth3 was added to a final concentration of 12.4 mg  ml1 . the absorbance was continually monitored at
340 nm using a cary 50 bio spectrophotometer. fe(ii) or fe(iii) specific
chelators were added to the reaction mixture. water replaced the chelator
in the control assays. the decrease in absorption in assays lacking th was
subtracted to correct for autoxidation of fe(ii) and bh4.
cell culture
rat pheochromocytoma cells (pc12 cells) were grown in 75 cm2 flasks
(40 ml medium) and on cell culture dishes (100  22 mm) in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (dmem) (cambrex) containing 10% inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 u  ml1 ) and
streptomycin (100 mg  ml1 ) in an atmosphere of 5% co2 at 37  c. the
culture medium was changed three times a week. experiments were performed on cells grown to confluence on culture dishes and washed in a
medium consisting of 150 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 25 mm hepes (ph 7.4),
2.2 mm cacl2, 0.8 mm mgcl2 and 5 mm glucose. the cells were then
incubated with 10 mci 3,5-3h-tyrosine for 1 h in an atmosphere of 5% co2
at 37  c. after incubation, extracellular 3h-tyrosine was removed. cells

either a partial inactivation of the enzyme during the reaction, a kinetic burst, or substrate depletion. the latter possibility was ruled out, as less than 5% of the tyrosine was
consumed after 5 min incubation, and direct measurements
(see ‘‘oxygraphic assay’’ below) confirmed that the concentrations of dioxygen and bh4 were unaltered during the
assay. the kd-values for the iron complexes of human th
isoforms have been determined experimentally to be 0.9–
3 mm at ph 6.5 and <1 mm at neutral ph (haavik et al.,
1992). thus, the possibility was considered that the enzyme
could become unsaturated with fe(ii) during the reaction.
however, when the kinetic experiments were repeated using a concentration of free fe(ii) that was 26-fold higher
(105 mm, fig. 1b) the initial reaction burst was comparable
to that observed using either 4 or 10 mm fe(ii), and the
estimated km-values were similar (see below).
the th activity as a function of initial oxygen concentrations shown in fig. 1a and b could be fitted to
a hyperbolic (michaelis-menten) curve. however, the
apparent km-values for dioxygen were highest after short
incubation periods (36.1  2.7 mm at 1 min), but leveled
of at 16.2  4.6 mm after 6–8 min incubation (fig. 1a)
(mean  sem, n ¼ 10). the lack of a stable km-value
during incubation is consistent with a deviance from a
mono-phasic steady state reaction.

the enzyme activity, confirming that the rapid reduction in
enzyme activity was not due to substrate depletion (data not
shown). similarly, the inclusion of 1 mg  ml1 bovine
 xxxg124xxx , 1 mg  ml1 catalase, or 10% glycerol to the
solution, or preincubation with dopamine (10 mm) did not
protect the enzyme against inactivation. furthermore, after
increasing the th concentration by adding a fresh aliquot of
enzyme to the chamber, a high initial reaction rate and
subsequent fall in activity was observed, suggesting that
incubation conditions had not changed during the first minutes of the original enzyme reaction. measurements of
l-dopa accumulation during this reaction interval showed
a reaction stoichiometry of 1:1:1:1 between consumed tyrosine and dioxygen, and formation of 3 h2 o and l-dopa
(fossbakk and haavik, 2005).

oxymetric assay of th activity
in the experiment shown in fig. 1 and in previous studies
on the oxygen dependency of th, the enzyme activity has
been determined using assays where aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and analyzed for the formation of either l-dopa or 3 h2 o, while the oxygen tension
has not been measured directly during the reaction (ikeda
et al., 1966; fisher and kaufman, 1972; katz, 1980;
fitzpatrick, 1991). we have recently developed an alternative assay of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, using
oxymetric determination of reaction velocities (fossbakk
and haavik, 2005). using the oxymetric assay, we have
been able to continuously measure the oxygen consumption catalyzed by th and other hydroxylases. this procedure also allowed a correction for side reactions consuming oxygen and fast determination of initial reaction
rates (<20 sec after addition of the enzyme) (fossbakk
and haavik, 2005).
as shown in fig. 2, a burst of oxygen consumption and
th activity was observed during the first few minutes of the
enzyme reaction. thus, 5 min after adding the enzyme, the
hth1 activity had declined to 31% of the initial rate. adding supplementary oxygen (to 240 mm), tyrosine (to 50 mm)
or bh4 (to 200 mm) after 4 min incubation did not restore

to a ‘low-activity’ state is shown by an exponential decay function (eq. (2)).
for comparison, the experimental data obtained using identical conditions in
the 3 h2 o-release assay (fig. 1a) have been plotted in the same axis (!).

the time resolution of the radiochemical th was lower than for the continuous oxymetric assay. in the radiochemical assay, the kinetic
values for the high and low activity states were based on measurements obtained at 0.5–1 and 8 min, respectively. for convenience, literature
values have been recalculated from partial pressures to molar concentrations of oxygen. similarly, all enzymatic activities are presented as

oxygen, as observed for hth1. a similar reaction burst
as for hth was observed when hpah was preincubated
with phenylalanine, as described in experimental procedures. bovine th and hpah that had not been activated
by phenylalanine before addition to the reaction mixture,
had no apparent burst activities and lower km 0 for oxygen (table 1). the more pronounced reaction burst observed in the oxymetric assay vs. the radiochemical assay may be due to the improved time resolution of the
former assay.
apparent km 0 - and kcat-values were calculated from
hyperbolic fitting to the rates measured at different oxygen concentrations following addition of the enzymes
(table 1). this gave results in concordance with the values obtained from the radioactive activity assays, but
even more pronounced differences between early and late
time points were observed. thus, for hth1 the km 0 -value
decreased by more than 60% and the kcat 0 -value by 80%
going from the initial 0.5–1 to 8 min of enzyme assay
(table 1). the different isoforms of hth did not show
any dramatic differences in their kinetic character, as
previously observed for the other substrates. however,
hth3 seemed to retain more of its activity, with less
change in the km 0 -value throughout the length of the
assay.

affinity (davis, 1976), it was of particular interest to determine the effects of th phosphorylation. figure 3 shows
the oxygen dependence of initial enzyme activity in hth1
in its nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated form. phosphorylation at ser-40 to a stoichiometry of 1 phosphate=
monomer (almas et al., 1992) did not alter the oxygen
affinity of the enzyme (table 1), but the phosphorylated
enzyme retained more of its initial activity during incubation (table 1).

oxygen dependent th activity in intact pc12 cells
having established consistently high km 0 -values of dioxygen for pure th, it was also important to determine
whether these values were relevant for intact catecholaminergic cells. thus, we designed a cell culture based
assay that could measure changes in th activity less than
5 min after alterations in oxygen concentrations. for these
studies, pc12 cells were selected as these cells have been
considered a convenient model system for carotid body
type 1 cells and also have been used extensively for studying molecular events occurring during hypoxic stress
(czyzyk-krzeska et al., 1994).
free 3,5-3h-tyrosine added to the culture medium was
rapidly taken up by the intact pc12 cells. immediately
after removal of extracellular tyrosine, the th activity in
the intact cells was determined by measuring the production of 3 h2 o from 3,5-3h-tyrosine, before any further
metabolic conversion of tyrosine had occurred. the th
activity was stimulated two-fold in the presence of an excess (100 mm) of extracellular bh4, suggesting that the
enzyme was not completely saturated by bh4 in vivo.
furthermore, we found that the th activity was dependent on the available concentration of o2. the rates of
3
h2 o accumulation during a 5 min period were studied
using different concentrations of dioxygen. when the oxygen concentration was raised from 33 to 139 mm, the rate
of 3 h2 o accumulation increased by 115  15% (mean 
sem, n ¼ 5–10, p ¼ 0.014, anova) (table 2).

redox state of the enzyme bound iron in the th reaction
it is well established that the activity of the pteridine
dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases is dependent
on a non-heme iron(ii) coordinated to his and glu residues at the active site and that the oxidized versions of the

was significant (p ¼ 0.014, anova)

enzymes are completely inactive (wallick et al., 1984;
haavik et al., 1991; ramsey et al., 1996; goodwill et al.,
1997; kuhn et al., 1999). th is typically isolated either as
the inactive apoenzyme, or as fe(iii) forms with or without bound catecholamine inhibitors and is rapidly activated either by incorporation of fe(ii), by tetrahydropteridine mediated reduction of fe(iii), or by removal of the
catecholamine inhibitors (haavik et al., 1988). as it has
been shown that a substoichiometrical oxidation of enzyme bound fe(ii) occurs during catalysis (ramsey et al.,
1996), we speculated whether this could explain the rapid
decline in activity in the th reaction. the redox state of
the iron was examined using different iron chelators. the
iron chelator  xxxd1824xxx  is a highly polar naturally
occurring bacterial siderophore. consistent with its selectivity for fe(iii), it shows no inhibitory action on th1
during short-term incubations using the same experimental conditions as used in the oxygraphic measurements.
however, in the presence of a large excess (65 mm) of
 xxxd1824xxx  the reaction velocity gradually dropped
to zero after a lag phase of 60–90 sec, consistent with a
gradual trapping of fe(iii) by  xxxd1824xxx  and inhibition of its reincorporation=reduction into the enzyme.
 xxxd1824xxx  did not oxidize the free fe(ii) in the
absence of th. in contrast, the enzyme inhibition by
fe(ii) chelators such as o-phenanthroline (ramsey et al.,
1996) or bathophenanthroline sulfonate (data not shown)
occurred immediately after their addition to the enzyme.
assuming complete inhibition of the th reaction upon
oxidation to fe(iii), and a stoichiometry of 1.0 iron=
enzyme subunit, it was calculated that approx. 16% of
all th turnovers resulted in conversion of the fe(ii) to
fe(iii).
discussion
here we report for the first time the oxygen dependence of
human th. we have demonstrated high initial reaction
rates in the hth1 reaction, with initial km 0 -values of
42.9  3.8 mm dioxygen (mean  sem, n ¼ 25), indicating that the enzymatic activity may be severely limited by
oxygen availability under such conditions. similar values
were obtained for hth3 and 4. moreover, we have described a turnover dependent inactivation of the enzyme
using several independent assay procedures. thus, for the
different isoforms of th we found a decrease in km 0 to
16–27 mm o2 and a 2–5 fold reduction in the specific
activity (table 1). the large variation in apparent km
values for oxygen in the previous studies may be due to
methodological limitations. thus, in former protocols the

 xxxg2276xxx  kinetics

concentrations of dioxygen in the experimental solutions
have never been measured directly. furthermore, th has
in most cases been extracted from mammalian tissues.
the difficulty of obtaining adequate amounts of purified
th has probably contributed to the variable and conflicting results. in the present study we used a homogenous
recombinant th synthesized in e. coli. the most detailed
previous kinetic characterization of th has been performed by fitzpatrick (1991, 2003). in the study on recombinant rat th the apparent km for oxygen was reported to be 21  19 mm (fitzpatrick, 1991). despite its
uncertainty, this value is close to the average value of the
‘‘low activity’’ forms of the human enzymes. thus, it is
interesting that the properties of the rat enzyme synthesized in insect cells studied by fitzpatrick (i.e. a eukaryote
organism) are similar to the human enzymes synthesized
in bacteria (table 1).
the km 0 -values of the low activity forms of the hth
isoforms are closer to previous studies on th from animals (table 1). as the animal enzymes have been exposed
to atmospheric levels of dioxygen, a partially oxidized
and less active state of the enzyme may have been studied.
thus, the present measurements based on the initial reaction rate could give a better picture of the true th oxygen
kinetics in vivo. the finding of a rapid inactivation of the
enzyme when it is exposed to supra physiological concentrations of oxygen, suggests that, ideally, enzyme kinetic
studies should be carried out on enzymes not previously
catalytically active, and in hypoxic chambers simulating
tissue concentrations of dioxygen.
inactivation of th – enzyme kinetic considerations
we found a substantial decrease in th activity during the
first 1–2 min of the enzyme reaction. for both the oxymetric assay and the conventional th assays that measure
dopa or 3 h2 o formation, the km-values for oxygen was
also higher during the first minute of the reaction than
later (table 1). our results strongly suggest that this is
not caused by changes in substrate concentration or inhibitory products. additionally, we found the same reaction
pattern using l-phenylalanine as a substrate in the hth
reaction. finally, the kinetic burst is not due to a slow
dissociation of products from the enzyme, as the enzyme
undergoes at least 70 turnovers per molecule during the
burst phase and the reaction burst should not be regarded
as a ‘‘pre-steady state’’ phenomenon in the conventional
enzyme kinetic sense. rather, our findings indicate that
th may exist in two different forms; a high kcat=high kmstate and a state with lower kcat- and km-values. this is in

461

accordance with recent findings of a negative cooperativity of bh4-binding to hth1 (flatmark et al., 1999).
thus, the kinetic burst is most pronounced when the
reaction is initiated by addition of fresh enzyme, as in
this study.
the transition to a low-activity state could either be due
to a slow conformational change or a covalent modification of the enzyme, e.g. oxidation of active site iron or
redox sensitive amino acid residues. evidence for both
types of reactions has previously been presented for th
and other pterin dependent hydroxylases (wallick et al.,
1984; ramsey et al., 1996; kuhn et al., 1999). we also examined whether the inactivation could be due to a change
in the oligomeric structure of th following enzyme dilution. however, the rate of inactivation was not dependent
on the concentration of protein added to the assay to the
same final concentration of enzyme (0.048–4.8 mg=ml
tested). however, the burst phase was more pronounced
at 5 and 15  c than at 25  c, indicating a temperature dependent conversion between different enzyme forms (data
not shown).
the enzyme oxidation hypothesis is supported by our
finding that the inactivation rate was dependent on the
initial oxygen concentration. thus, at very low and probably physiological oxygen levels, there was little decline
in activity. incubating the enzyme in a solution with pure
oxygen for several minutes without initiating the reaction,
did not reduce the initial enzyme activity when, subsequently, the reaction was started by adding bh4. thus, the
inactivation was turnover dependent. furthermore, the putative oxidizing agent could be dioxygen itself, or a reactive oxygen species generated during catalytic turnover.
the oxidizable target could include the enzyme active site
fe(ii) or some critical sulfhydryl groups, which both have
been shown to be important for catalytic activity and to be
readily oxidized (wallick et al., 1984; kuhn et al., 1999).
however, modification by  xxxd2684xxx  of the sulfhydryl groups of hpah did not alter the pattern of inactivation of that enzyme, indicating that sulfhydryl groups
are not critical for this process (fossbakk and haavik,
2005). preincubation of the enzyme with an excess of catalase, dopamine or protein stabilizing agents as glycerol
and  xxxg124xxx  did not prevent inactivation, confirming that it is not due to a non-specific protein modification, or due to  xxxd2298xxx .
interestingly, th isolated from bovine adrenals had a
lower initial activity and did not show the same pattern of
turnover dependent inactivation. the latter enzyme, which
already has been exposed to oxygen at atmospheric levels,
and has been catalytically active, is probably in a reduced

462

m. rostrup et al.

activity form, kcat 0 ¼ 23.6 min1 of bovine th, compared
to kcat 0 ¼ 86.3 min1 for hth1 (haavik et al., 1988). bovine adrenal th is isolated in a partially phosphorylated
state (0.62  0.04 phosphate=subunit (haavik et al., 1988)).
similarly, hth1 that was phosphorylated on ser40 retained more activity after oxygen exposure (p < 0.05,
t-test) (table 1). as phosphorylation of ser40 is known
to activate the enzyme and slightly change the ligand state
of the active site iron (andersson et al., 1992), we suggest
that the iron site is also the main target of the turnover
dependent inactivation of th.
it is well established that th containing fe(ii) is the
catalytically active species (haavik et al., 1991; ramsey
et al., 1996). similarly, we have demonstrated that the
enzyme bound fe(ii) in human th can be oxidized to
fe(iii) species by  xxxd2298xxx  or dioxygen, as studied by epr, x-ray absorption, and m€
ossbauer spectroscopies (meyer-klaucke et al., 1996). the kinetics of fe(ii)
oxidation in rat th has been examined using a combination of visible and epr spectroscopy and activity measurements (ramsey et al., 1996; frantom et al., 2006). in
these studies, the loss of activity upon fe(ii) oxidation
showed a close correlation with the appearance of a highspin fe(iii) species by epr spectroscopy and a visible
absorbance band around 375 nm. a second order rate constant of 210 m1 sec1 was determined for the oxidation
of rat th by oxygen (frantom et al., 2006). during catalytic turnover, the regeneration of enzyme bound fe(ii)
may become kinetically limiting. thus, frantom et al.
have calculated the half-life of reduction of fe(iii)th
by bh4 to be 3–5 sec under physiological conditions
(frantom et al., 2006). ramsey et al. studied the effects
of the fe(iii) chelator dihydroxynaphthalene on the rate
of inactivation of rat th, observing a similar time dependent inhibition of the enzyme as we observed with
 xxxd1824xxx  (ramsey et al., 1996). these findings
indicate that a substantial amount of the active site fe(ii)
is oxidized within the first 1–2 min of the enzyme reaction. as the kinetic burst cannot be overcome by increasing the exogenous concentrations of fe(ii) (fig. 1b), we
suggest that it is the reduction of active site fe(iii),
rather than incorporation of ‘‘new’’ fe(ii) that becomes
rate limiting during the steady state th reaction. as the
presence of iron chelators can perturb the fe(ii)–fe(iii)
equilibrium, the use of a ‘‘ non invasive’’ method such
as epr spectroscopy would be preferable (andersson
et al., 1992; meyer-klaucke et al., 1996). however, as
this technique is relatively insensitive, it was not applied
using the conditions of the enzyme kinetic measurements
presented here.

physiological implications
there have been many reports on tissue partial pressure
of oxygen, generally showing that the oxygen concentration is low (smith et al., 1977; feinsilver et al., 1987;
siggaard-andersen et al., 1995), and lower than the kmvalues for hth reported here (table 1). thus, th is probably not saturated with oxygen in vivo in humans. this
is similar to human prolyl 4-hydroxylases which have
km(o2)-values of 230–250 mm, and where the enzyme
activity has been shown to be directly proportional to tissue oxygen levels, making the enzymes effective oxygen
sensors in vivo (hirsila et al., 2003). normobaric hypoxia
decreases the accumulation of dopa after the inhibition of  xxxg618xxx , an index
of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation in rat brain (davis and
carlsson, 1973; brown et al., 1975; katz, 1980). similarly,
we found an immediate decrease in 3 h2 o production from
3
h-tyrosine when pc12 cells were exposed to moderate
hypoxia (table 2). studies in humans have also suggested
a temporary reduction in catecholamine synthesis during
hypoxia (leuenberger et al., 1991; sevre et al., 2001).
moreover, in humans the concentration of plasma catecholamines correlated well with the peripheral oxygen
saturation (rostrup, 1998). however, after longer exposure to hypoxia, the reduction in plasma catecholamine
levels is no longer obvious (rostrup, 1998). one explanation may be that other aspects of catecholamine metabolism are changed during hypoxia. thus, peripheral clearance of circulating catecholamines is increased during
short-term hypoxia (leuenberger et al., 1991), while longterm effects on clearance have not been studied. moreover, after a certain time compensatory mechanisms, such
as enzyme induction, will take place (gozal et al., 2005).
the activity of other enzymes in the synthesis of catecholamines may also be sensitive to hypoxia. thus, it has been
suggested that the activity of dopamine-b-hydroxylase
may be limited by hypoxia (brown et al., 1975), which
may further reduce the synthesis of noradrenaline and
adrenaline.
our results may be relevant for understanding the adaptation to hypoxic conditions in intact animals. in mammals, dopamine exerts a tonic inhibition of the carotid
bodies. thus, a reduced th activity would lead to a diminished dopaminergic inhibition, causing a time-dependent increase in carotid body sensitivity to hypoxia
(bisgard, 1995). the rise in arterial chemoreceptor sensitivity at low oxygen pressures may therefore be an effect
of reduced th activity and reduced production of the inhibitor dopamine in the carotid bodies.

 xxxg2276xxx  kinetics

conclusions
the km for dioxygen of hth appears to be higher in the
initial phase (1–2 min) of the enzyme activity in vitro than
previously reported from animal studies. tissue oxygen
availability may be a limiting factor in the synthesis of
catecholamines in humans. furthermore, the enzyme is
rapidly inactivated at the experimental conditions usually
employed to measure in vitro activities. this could be due
to the accumulation of an inactive fe(iii) form of the enzyme. the enzyme inactivation has important implications for the interpretation of kinetic data previously obtained on this enzyme.
