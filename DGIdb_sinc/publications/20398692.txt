scopolamine is used as a standard/reference drug for inducing cognitive deﬁcits in healthy humans and
animals. effects are often interpreted in terms of a role of acetylcholine in mnemonic and/or attentional processes. in this paper an overview is given of the effects of scopolamine on animal behavior.
examination of the dose–response curve of systemically administered scopolamine indicates that sensory discrimination and attention are most sensitive to disruption. when higher doses (>0.03 mg/kg)
are used, deﬁcits in other cognitive and non-cognitive functions (e.g., learning and memory, locomotor
activity) are reported. several behavioral processes (taste aversion, anxiety, short-term memory, attention) are found to be affected after intracerebral injections of scopolamine. it is concluded that effects
on learning and memory performance which are observed after higher doses of scopolamine are mediated by (1) primary effects on attention and sensory/stimulus discrimination, (2) non-speciﬁc effects on
behavior (e.g., locomotor activity, anxiety), and (3) peripheral side-effects (e.g., pupil dilation, salivation).
finally, the validity of scopolamine as a pharmacological model for cognitive impairment is discussed.
the use of muscarinic m1 antagonists is suggested as a more selective and effective way of inducing
cholinergic-induced cognitive deﬁcits.

1. introduction
1.1. short historic overview
in ancient times people already knew that certain plant extracts
possess the capability to inﬂuence the mental state of an individual
(schultes and hofmann, 1979). the extracts of several herbs and
plants like belladonna, mandrake, datura and henbane were used
to make ‘magic potions’ which could induce delusional states of
the mind. after ingestion, most individuals would lose all sense of
reality and afterwards could not recall what occurred during the
time of intoxication. furthermore, belladonna extract was used in
the middle ages by women who wished to increase their attractiveness by pupil dilation. much later it was discovered that these
herbs and plants contain a relatively high concentration of tropan
alkaloids such as atropine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine hydrobromide (hereafter abbreviated as scopolamine), which are the
active ingredients responsible for inducing hallucinations.
of these tropan alkaloids, the nonselective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine has frequently been employed in the clinic,
mainly to inhibit the effects of parasympathic activation (brown
and taylor, 1996; see also safer and allen, 1971). however, there
exists a multitude of other clinical applications of this compound. for instance, the amnesic properties of scopolamine were
already noticed at the beginning of this century (gaus, 1906;
thompson and cotterill, 1909) and therefore the substance was
employed for obstetrical analgesia. moreover, in 1874 the use of
belladonna to antagonize parkinsonism tremor was reported. a
fourth well-known application of scopolamine is the alleviation of
 xxxd1892xxx  (klöcker et al., 2001; parrott, 1989). besides being
employed in a clinical setting, scopolamine has also been used to
facilitate interrogation (geis, 1961).
traditionally, scopolamine has been used in the ﬁeld of neuropsychopharmacology as a standard/reference drug for inducing
age- and dementia-related cognitive deﬁcits in healthy humans and
animals (ebert and kirch, 1998; flood and cherkin, 1986). interestingly, the clinical observation that scopolamine treatment as a
premedication for anesthesia frequently gave rise to amnesia, stimulated research on the effects of cholinergic blockade on human
memory (see hardy and wakely, 1962; kopelman, 1986). the use of
scopolamine as a pharmacological model of ‘cholinergic amnesia’
became very popular after the cholinergic hypothesis of geriatric
memory dysfunction was postulated (bartus et al., 1982). this
hypothesis assumed that the age-related decline in cognitive functions was predominantly related to a decrease in the integrity of
cholinergic neurotransmission. since scopolamine-induced amnesia was most likely caused by a blockade of cholinergic signaling,
it was used to model cognitive deﬁcits associated with aging and
(alzheimer’s) dementia (flood and cherkin, 1986). the ﬁrst experimental studies that evaluated the effects of scopolamine on cognitive functions in man were published in the early seventies (e.g.,
crow and grove-white, 1973; safer and allen, 1971). drachman
and leavitt (1974) were the ﬁrst who claimed that, when given to
healthy volunteers, scopolamine mimicked many of the cognitive
dysfunctions that could be observed in aging and dementia.
the signiﬁcance of scopolamine use in humans also gave rise
to studies in the ﬁeld of animal research. the ﬁrst experiments

that investigated the central effects of scopolamine in animals were
reported in the 1950s (e.g., boren and navarro, 1959; hearst, 1959).
scopolamine was employed to assess the role of the cholinergic system in non-speciﬁc types of behavior such as the rate of responding
in operant tasks. muscarinic antagonists such as scopolamine were
presumed to induce behavioral disinhibition2 (carlton, 1963). later
studies have employed scopolamine as a golden standard drug to
validate new test models of cognitive function (e.g., ennaceur and
meliani, 1992), and to investigate the role of the cholinergic system in cognition—for instance by testing its interaction with other
drugs (levin, 1988) and speciﬁc brain lesions (chudasama et al.,
2004). these experiments supported the notion that scopolamine
induced impairments in a wide variety of cognitive-behavioral
tasks (bartholomew hodges jr. et al., 2009; chintoh et al., 2003;
estape and steckler, 2002; flood and cherkin, 1986; hughes et
al., 2004; ison and bowen, 2000; nomura et al., 1994; robinson
et al., 2004; sambeth et al., 2007). another important objective in
which scopolamine has often been used is the preclinical testing
of new substances that are designed to treat cognitive dysfunction
(snyder et al., 2005). thus, if a compound is effective in reversing
scopolamine-induced cognitive deﬁcits in animals, it might also
improve cognitive function in healthy participants or people diagnosed with a neuropsychiatric disorder. one of the advantages of
the scopolamine model is that it provides a simple and quick way
for testing cognition-enhancing properties of new drugs. however,
this type of approach in preclinical screening of novel substances is
associated with limited predictive validity, as it tends to yield a high
number of false positives (i.e., drugs that were found to counteract
scopolamine-induced deﬁcits in preclinical research often do not
have the same efﬁcacy in clinical studies; sarter, 2006).
1.2. the cholinergic hypothesis
a more recent hypothesis regarding the role of acetylcholine in
learning and memory processes has been put forward (hasselmo,
1999, 2006; hasselmo et al., 2002; hasselmo and mcgaughy, 2004;
meeter et al., 2004). it has been suggested that acetylcholine plays
an important role in hippocampal mode shifting between encoding and retrieval. speciﬁcally, a network model has been proposed
which features the entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, ca3, ca1 and
the medial septum (meeter et al., 2004). in this model, high acetylcholine would allow acquisition of new information to take place,
while low acetylcholine would enable recall of previously stored
memories (hasselmo, 2004). hence, encoding should be impaired
by decreases in acetylcholine and consolidation and retrieval is
likely to be affected by increases in acetylcholine. support in favor
of this hypothesis is the ﬁnding that scopolamine predominantly
impairs acquisition processes and can even facilitate consolidation
(e.g., winters et al., 2007, 2006, 2008; young et al., 1995). moreover,
in a delayed non-matching to sample task intraseptal infusion of
the cholinergic agonist carbachol 30 min prior to the sample was

2
at the time, it was believed that the cholinergic system served to inhibit an
activating system. hence, reducing cholinergic neurotransmission by administration of a muscarinic antagonist would disinhibit this activating system and cause
behavioral activation/disinhibition.

found to have no effect on performance. in contrast, infusion immediately or 90 min after the sample produced amnesia (bunce et al.,
2004).
however, the cholinergic hypothesis of memory function as
originally put forward by bartus et al. (1982) has undergone a
revision after several lesion studies were performed which used
the highly speciﬁc cholinergic toxin 192 igg-saporin (wiley et al.,
1995). this immunotoxin is a combination of a ribosome inactivating protein (saporin, which is derived from the plant saponaria
ofﬁcinalis) and a monoclonal antibody (192 igg) which acts on the
low-afﬁnity  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) receptor p75 (wiley et al.,
1991). saporin is a toxin which enzymatically shuts down ribosome
protein synthesis, leading to cell death (wrenn and wiley, 1998).
the addition of 192 igg to saporin enables the induction of selective
cholinergic basal forebrain lesions in rats, as only the cholinergic
neurons in this brain area express the p75 receptor (wenk, 1997).
however, animals that were lesioned with this toxin did not show
clear learning and memory impairments and hence it appeared that
the inﬂuence of acetylcholine was more subtle than assumed (e.g.,
baxter and gallagher, 1996; baxter et al., 1997; chiba et al., 1999;
mcgaughy et al., 2000; torres et al., 1994; voytko, 1996). furthermore, it was found that attention tests tended to be relatively more
sensitive to treatment by scopolamine as compared to learning
and memory tasks (bartholomew hodges jr. et al., 2009; humby
et al., 1999; jones et al., 1995; jones and higgins, 1995; mirza and
stolerman, 2000; shannon and eberle, 2006). indeed, scopolamine
disrupted performance in these tasks at much lower doses than
those which were effective in learning and memory tests. it was
concluded that acetylcholine is mainly involved in attentional processes (blokland, 1995; everitt and robbins, 1997; fibiger, 1991;
sarter and bruno, 1997).
apart from the role of acetylcholine in cognition, this neurotransmitter has also been strongly implicated in optimization of
the signal-to-noise ratio in the parietal and visual striate cortex
(murphy and sillito, 1991; sato et al., 1987), a feature which is
deemed essential for stimulus processing. for instance, in rats that
were performing a sustained attention task, cholinergic deafferentiation was found to diminish the neuronal activation of detected
cues and enhance neuronal activity to distractor stimuli in neurons
in the posterior parietal cortex (broussard et al., 2009). according
to the authors, this implicated an important modulatory role of
acetylcholine in the detection and processing of relevant stimuli
and the inhibitory suppression of irrelevant cues under attentionally challenging conditions. moreover, it has been reported that
increasing acetylcholine levels with donepezil reduces the spatial spread of excitatory visual responses in human visual cortex,
which was suggested to be caused by a facilitation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission and/or suppression of intracortical
connections (silver et al., 2008). these effects were interpreted by
the authors to be consistent with a role of acetylcholine in reducing excitatory receptive ﬁeld size of cortical neurons in animals.
furthermore, it was reported that attending to the particular receptive ﬁeld of a v1 neuron caused an increase in ﬁring rate, which was
enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine and modulated by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, but not by the nicotinic antagonist
 xxxd2550xxx  (herrerro et al., 2008). these results thus demonstrated an important role for muscarinic but not nicotinic receptor
mechanisms in cholinergic attentional modulation.
these recent notions concerning the function of acetylcholine
have, of course, direct consequences for interpreting effects of
scopolamine on cognition. scopolamine is a relatively speciﬁc
antagonist of muscarinic receptors, i.e., not nicotinic at low doses
(schmeller et al., 1995; weiner, 1980), and its effects should most
likely be interpreted within a cholinergic framework. in conclusion, acetylcholine seems to be primarily involved in attentional
processes (blokland, 1995; everitt and robbins, 1997; fibiger,

1309

1991; sarter and bruno, 1997) and plasticity of sensory neurons
(rasmusson, 2000). this constitutes a shift from the claims of the
cholinergic hypothesis of learning and memory in the early eighties
(bartus et al., 1982, 1985) and from the relatively more restrictive
hypothesis which was put forward more recently (hasselmo, 1999,
2006; hasselmo and mcgaughy, 2004; parikh et al., 2007).
1.3. aim and scope of this review
the current review provides a summary of the effects of
scopolamine on animal behavior. first, the general properties of
scopolamine and effects of this drug on non-behavioral measures
will be discussed. next, an overview will be given of behavioral
studies which assessed the effects of peripheral and central administration of scopolamine. finally, the validity of scopolamine as
a pharmacological model for inducing cognitive impairment will
be debated and muscarinic m1 antagonists will be introduced
as a more selective and hence, more effective way of inducing
cognitive deﬁcits due to cholinergic blockade. since scopolamine
can be viewed as the golden standard for inducing cholinergic
impairments, it was decided to put the focus of the review on
this compound. discussion of nonselective muscarinic drugs other
than scopolamine is beyond the scope of this review (with the
exception of selective muscarinic m1 antagonists which will be put
forward as an alternative for scopolamine). the speciﬁc characteristics of various drugs (e.g., blood–brain barrier penetration, central
vs. peripheral effects, duration of action) may lead to differences in
the effects of these ligands on cognition, which may therefore complicate interpretation of the outcome of different studies. in short, in
the ﬁeld of neuropsychopharmacology several additional nonselective muscarinic antagonists have been used besides scopolamine.
for instance, atropine has also been frequently employed in behavioral studies, although less often than scopolamine. atropine is less
potent than scopolamine (about a factor 10, depending on assay),
but in general effects on task performance are highly comparable
between both compounds.
an additional restriction was made with respect to the type
of experiments which were included in this review. reference is
made to studies which primary aim was to investigate the effects
of scopolamine (or selective muscarinic m1 antagonists) on cognition and behavior. consequently, studies which have employed
non-behavioral parameters (such as in vitro and/or imaging experiments) will only be discussed very superﬁcially. moreover, no
extensive review is given of experiments in which pharmacological
reversal of scopolamine-induced impairment is investigated. since
a vast amount of studies on scopolamine has accumulated over the
past 40 years, it would be impossible to refer to all of them. nevertheless, it is our opinion that the most important and inﬂuential
articles have been included in the present review.
2. general properties of scopolamine
2.1. biochemical characteristics of scopolamine
scopolamine has generally been regarded as a nonselective
muscarinic receptor antagonist (bolden et al., 1992). the afﬁnity
of scopolamine to bind to the muscarinic receptor is about 1 nm in
the brain of rats (lee and el fakahany, 1985). furthermore, it has
been demonstrated that scopolamine has a high selectivity for the
muscarinic receptor (hulme et al., 1978), although high doses of
scopolamine can also block nicotinic receptors (schmeller et al.,
1995; weiner, 1980). currently, ﬁve different subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been characterized (caulﬁeld, 1993). this
differentiation in muscarinic receptors was discovered after ﬁnding
discrepancies in the binding characteristics of several ligands (e.g.,
scopolamine,  xxxd2965xxx ; messer et al., 1987a). pharmacological

methods provided evidence for the existence of three receptor subtypes (m1, m2 and m3, see waelbroeck et al., 1986), whereas the
fourth and ﬁfth muscarinic receptor subtypes were discovered only
after molecular tools became available (yasuda et al., 1992). all
muscarinic receptors are g-protein coupled receptors: m1, m3 and
m5 are linked to gq which activates phospholipase (pl)c, whereas
m2 and m4 are coupled to gi/o and can affect adenylyl cyclase or
various ion channels (conn et al., 2009). the m2 and m4 receptors are located presynaptically (caulﬁeld, 1993), where they act
as autoreceptors to reduce neurotransmitter release (bymaster et
al., 2003). the orthosteric binding sites, to which acetylcholine and
several muscarinic compounds bind, have been well characterized
(caulﬁeld, 1993; caulﬁeld and birdsall, 1998). however, allosteric
muscarinic receptor sites are not as extensively deﬁned; these sites
could be interesting targets for the development of more selective muscarinic compounds which can modulate the activation of
orthosteric muscarinic receptors by acetylcholine (wess, 2005).
molecular biological studies revealed that there are ﬁve different genes responsible for the expression of muscarinic receptors
(bonner et al., 1987, 1988). furthermore, each receptor subtype is
likely having its own speciﬁc functional role reﬂected by differences in physiological distribution. in table 1, an overview is given
of the localization of muscarinic receptors in the brain and body.
localization and distribution of these subtypes was determined
using mrna techniques and receptor subtype-speciﬁc antibodies.
it appears that m1 (and m5) receptors are predominantly located
in the brain, although a high immunoprecipitation of m1 receptors
has also been observed in the vas deferens (caulﬁeld, 1993). on
the other hand, the m2, m3 and m4 receptors seem to be evenly
distributed throughout the body and the brain. since scopolamine
has no preference for any muscarinic subtype (bolden et al., 1992),
it nonselectively blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic
receptors and thus affects several physiological functions. however, it appears that the central effects of scopolamine might be
mediated by the m1 and (possibly) m5 receptors because of their
speciﬁc distribution (caulﬁeld, 1993).
2.2. peripheral vs. central effects of scopolamine
most studies have used systemic injections (iv, im, ip, sc) to
investigate the effects of scopolamine, as this is a relatively easy
manner to apply the drug. unfortunately, systemic administration
makes it difﬁcult to differentiate between the central and peripheral effects of a compound. in the case of scopolamine, one way
to deal with this problem is to include an experimental group that
is given methylscopolamine at an equivalent dose (harvey et al.,

1983). methylscopolamine, or scopolamine methylbromide, is a
quaternary form of scopolamine that has the same receptor binding
characteristics but does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier
(pradhan and roth, 1968). the substance has been used as a control
condition for the peripheral side-effects of scopolamine hydrobromide treatment (evans, 1975). thus, if scopolamine hydrobromide
impairs cognitive performance at a given dose and an equivalent
dose of methylscopolamine does not, it can be assumed that the
effects of the former are mediated by a central mechanism. in animal studies the use of methylscopolamine has been questioned,
as it has been found to have an inﬂuence on measures of cognitive performance (e.g., andrews et al., 1994; herremans et al.,
1995; pakarinen and moerschbaecher, 1993; van haaren and van
hest, 1989). this would suggest that methylscopolamine can also
have central actions, especially when high doses are used. a microdialysis study showed that methylscopolamine indeed increased
cortical acetylcholine release, although it should be mentioned that
this effect occured at relatively higher doses (factors 2–4) than
those which are commonly used for administration of scopolamine
hydrobromide (moore et al., 1992b). although there exist a lot
of studies that show no central/cognitive effects of methylscopolamine, abovementioned data caution simply assuming that this
compound can be used a tool to dissociate central and peripheral
effects of scopolamine hydrobromide.

3. non-behavioral effects of scopolamine
3.1. pupil diameter, salivation and smooth muscle function
it is well-known that scopolamine dilates the pupil and impairs
the lens accommodation (leopold and comroe, 1948), an effect
likely to be mediated by the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  (shiraishi
and takayanagi, 1993). in a study by jones and higgins (1995), a
dose-dependent increase in pupil size was found after scopolamine
injections (0.01–0.1 mg/kg, sc), which was already observed at a
dose of 0.01 mg/kg. interestingly, methylscopolamine was approximately twice more effective in dilating the pupil than scopolamine
hydrobromide, suggesting that the peripheral effects of the former are relatively more pronounced than those of the latter.
scopolamine-induced mydriasis could lead to a disruption of performance in visual discrimination tasks. for instance, due to an
increased sensitivity to light, visual stimuli of relatively high intensity might be experienced as aversive (leaton and kreindler, 1972).
alternatively, effects of scopolamine on pupil diameter could also
improve performance on visual discrimination tasks: stimuli might
be more easily perceived if they are presented very brieﬂy or at a
low illuminance.
moreover, scopolamine reduces salivation which is probably
mediated by cholinergic blockade at muscarinic m3 receptors, but
m1 and m5 receptors could also play a minor role (dai et al., 1991;
flynn et al., 1997; shannon et al., 1994; shida et al., 1993; tobin et
al., 2002). because of this ‘dry mouth effect’ of scopolamine solid
food rewards are likely to become more difﬁcult to consume. this
could decrease the palatability of dry food, which could in turn
interfere with performance on behavioral tasks that rely on this
type of reinforcer in order to motivate the animals. indeed, scopolamine was reported to already decrease dry food consumption at a
dose of 0.01 mg/kg, but it was suggested that using a liquid reward
could counteract this side-effect (bartholomew hodges jr. et al.,
2009).
in the respiratory, vascular and gastrointestinal system, m2 and
m3 receptors appear to mediate contraction of smooth muscle
( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1996). in what way nonselective effects of scopolamine
on peripheral smooth muscle functions disrupt behavioral performance has not been directly assessed. nevertheless, high doses of

i. klinkenberg, a. blokland / neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews 34 (2010) 1307–1350

scopolamine might induce gastrointestinal distress (e.g., constipation) or give rise to changes in cerebral blood ﬂow and glucose
consumption due to vasodilation/vasoconstriction, which in turn
could interfere with behavioral performance.
3.2. electroencephalogram
a great deal of research has been dedicated to the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cortical electroencephalogram
(eeg). one of the pacemakers of the cortical eeg appears to be
the cholinergic system (see brimblecombe, 1974; dringenberg and
vanderwolf, 1998). muscarinic agonists have been found to activate the eeg in rats (i.e., low voltage fast activity; lvfa). on
the other hand, scopolamine decreased the lvfa after a relative high dose (5 mg/kg, ip) in anesthetized rats (dringenberg and
vanderwolf, 1997). however, a decrease in lvfa in rats has also
been observed after administration of relatively lower doses of
scopolamine (0.8 mg/kg, ip (riekkinen et al., 1990) or after injecting
it iontophoretically (applied 5 × 10−8 a) into the cortex (spehlmann
and norcross, 1982). these effects seemed to be mediated by the
ascending cholinergic ﬁbers from the basal forebrain (vanderwolf,
1988) and indicated that scopolamine gives rise to a cortical deactivating state. in addition, it appeared that scopolamine can also
induce disturbances in gamma oscillations (rodriguez et al., 2004).
the effects of scopolamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 mg/kg, sc) on eventrelated potentials (erps) have also been assessed. for instance,
scopolamine reduced the amplitude of auditory evoked potentials (i.e., p18 and n40 components) in a dose-dependent manner
(campbell et al., 1995), which again suggested that it tends to lower
eeg activity. these results were replicated by a more recent study
(sambeth et al., 2007).
it appears quite a challenging task to relate animal eeg measures
to behavioral data. for instance, a study by sambeth et al. (2007)
reported an impairment of object recognition, an increase of the
theta frequency in the eeg and a change in the n1 and n2 components of the aep closer to baseline after scopolamine treatment
(0.1 mg/kg, ip). both the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil
(3 mg/kg, po) and nicotine (0.1 mg/kg, ip) reversed the impairment in object recognition. however, combination treatment of
scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg, ip) with donepezil (3 mg/kg, po) increased
theta even more, whereas nicotine (0.1 mg/kg, ip) reversed the
scopolamine-induced increment of theta to placebo level. the clear
dissociation between effects of drug combination treatments on
memory and eeg suggests that the relation between these two
measures is not straightforward.
in human participants, scopolamine has been reported to
increase delta and theta activity, while decreasing alpha and beta
frequency bands (ebert and kirch, 1998), indicative of a general
slowing of eeg activity. scopolamine (0.25–0.75 mg, im) was also
found to reduce the amplitude and increase the latency of ﬂashvep p2-n3 erps with no effect on pattern-veps (bajalan et al.,
1986; sannita et al., 1993). moreover, scopolamine decreased p3
amplitude of auditory evoked potentials (meador et al., 1995). a
few studies have examined the relation between effects of scopolamine on eeg power and memory performance. for instance,
sloan et al. (1992) found no correlation between slowing of eeg
power and decreased word recall on a verbal memory task after
scopolamine. in contrast, kikuchi et al. (1999) reported a negative correlation between memory score and absolute delta and
alpha-1 power, whereas relative alpha-1 power was negatively
correlated and relative alpha-2 power positively correlated with
mnemonic performance after scopolamine administration. overall, large alpha and small theta power seems indicative of good
cognitive performance (klimesch, 1999), which is in concurrence
with scopolamine-induced slowing of eeg activity and concomitant disruption of performance.

1311

in conclusion, in both animals and humans scopolamine appears
to decrease the power of higher frequency bands—i.e., lvfa in
animals, alpha and beta frequencies in humans (dringenberg and
vanderwolf, 1997; ebert and kirch, 1998). moreover, scopolamine
reduced the amplitude of auditory evoked potentials in rats and
humans (campbell et al., 1995; meador et al., 1995), although
it should be mentioned that erps are not directly comparable
between the two species (sambeth et al., 2004, 2003). scopolamine
is also found to disrupt cognitive performance in rats as well as in
humans (e.g., memory performance: kikuchi et al., 1999; sambeth
et al., 2007; sloan et al., 1992).
4. behavioral effects of scopolamine
in table 2, an overview is given of the effects of systemic
administration of scopolamine in various behavioral paradigms.
studies on the effects of scopolamine on behavior and cognition
have been sorted in reverse chronological order per behavioral
test paradigm. doses were peripherally administered in rats, mice,
rabbits, mongolian gerbils, cats, pigeons or monkeys. table 3
provides an overview of the effects of scopolamine in different
behavioral tasks after central administration. studies on the effect
of scopolamine on behavior and cognition have been sorted in
reverse chronological order per targeted brain region and behavioral paradigm.
the discussion of the behavioral effects of scopolamine will be
divided into ﬁve parts. the ﬁrst part will deal with the effects of
scopolamine on locomotor behavior and motor learning. in the
following three sections the effects of scopolamine on anxiety,
sensory/stimulus discrimination and attention will be discussed.
of note, although drug effects on the latter two functions cannot always be dissociated from one another, discussion of effects
of scopolamine on sensory/stimulus discrimination vs. attention
will be separated on basis of the claims made in the respective
reports. furthermore, effects on sensory or stimulus discrimination tests are usually strictly related to presentation of the stimulus,
whereas effects on attentional tasks can also be attributed to other
(non-)cognitive factors. the ﬁfth section will discuss the effects of
scopolamine on learning and memory.
4.1. locomotor activity and motor learning
scopolamine has been generally found to increase locomotor activity, already at systemic doses of 0.056 mg/kg and higher
(chintoh et al., 2003; day et al., 1991; gholamreza et al., 2002;
nomura et al., 1994; pradhan and roth, 1968; renfro et al., 1972;
sipos et al., 1999; watanabe and shimizu, 1989). cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus, striatum and/or frontal cortex appeared to
be correlated positively with scopolamine-induced hyperactivity
(day et al., 1991) and central infusion of scopolamine (1, 10 ␮g in
0.5 ␮l/side) in the amygdala was found to increase locomotor activity (nomura et al., 1994). in contrast, several experiments which
used memory and/or operant tasks have reported a decrease in
locomotor activity after systemic administration of scopolamine
(anisman and kokkinidis, 1975; bartholomew hodges jr. et al.,
2009; besheer et al., 2001; masuoka et al., 2006; myhrer et al., 2004;
pradhan and roth, 1968) or no effect a all (feigley, 1974; humby
et al., 1999). thus, the role of scopolamine in locomotor behavior,
i.e., an increase or a decrease in activity, appears to be dependent
on various experimental factors (such as strain, test, type of reinforcer, drug doses, etc.). for instance, a recent study showed that
the effect of scopolamine on general activity in light–dark boxes
was dependent on room novelty and sex (hughes et al., 2004). for
the scope of the current review it is sufﬁcient to note that possible effects of scopolamine on locomotor activity should be taken

into account when evaluating the role of scopolamine in cognition,
especially in tests in which locomotor activity is closely related to
the main dependent variable (see also anisman, 1975).
a recent study examined the role of scopolamine on motor skills
and motor learning (thouvarecq et al., 2001). it was shown that
methylscopolamine (0.6, 1.2 mg/kg, sc) impaired the motor skills
of mice whereas the same dose of scopolamine hydrobromide (0.6,
1.2 mg/kg, sc) did not. moreover, motor learning was found to be
affected by scopolamine hydrobromide but not by methylscopolamine. it was reported that motor skills were independent of motor
learning, as no correlation between the scores was found. in conclusion, the dissociation between motor skills and motor learning
on the one hand, and the dissociation between the effects of scopolamine hydrobromide and methylscopolamine on the other, would
strongly suggest that scopolamine hydrobromide mainly affects
motor learning abilities rather than motor skills.

4.2. anxiety
the effects of scopolamine on anxiety-related behaviors have
been investigated in a limited number of papers (hughes et al.,
2004; smythe et al., 1996). of note, the distinction between tasks
assessing locomotor activity (as discussed above) and those measuring anxiety can be rather small, since these paradigms often
use similar experimental setups (such as the open ﬁeld). therefore,
when interpreting effects of scopolamine on performance in these
paradigms, one should keep in mind that an underlying effect on
locomotor behavior could be present. nevertheless, special changes
to the apparatus allow for making inferences with respect to anxiety. for instance, by dividing an open ﬁeld in a dark and a bright
compartment it is possible to measure the time animals spent in
each of these sections. in a study that assessed light–dark preferences, it was reported that scopolamine (2 mg/kg, ip) lowered the

1332

i. klinkenberg, a. blokland / neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews 34 (2010) 1307–1350

number of transitions to the light side (hughes et al., 2004). furthermore, in the black–white box, scopolamine (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg, ip)
was found to increase anxiety-related behavior on both activitydependent as well as activity-independent parameters (smythe et
al., 1996). thus, possible behavioral activating effects of the substance could be excluded. moreover, the doses used in this study
were much lower than those used in studies that reported behavioral activation. in the same experiment, infusion of scopolamine
in the hippocampus (15, 30 ␮g in 3 ␮l/side) increased anxiogenic
behavior in the black–white box, while locomotor activity was
unaffected. in conclusion, scopolamine generally has an anxiogenic
effect on behavior which should be taken into account when interpreting effects of this ligand in other behavioral tasks.
4.3. stimulus discrimination
the manner in which stimulus discrimination can be studied
and drug effects can be assessed in animal models has been thoroughly described in the review by heise and milar (1984). in this
paper, great attention was devoted to the different ways in which
stimulus discrimination could be investigated in animals and also
to possible confounding factors that could lead to erroneous conclusions. for instance, it was suggested that assessments of drug
effects on stimulus discrimination can be made more sensitive by
interposing a delay between stimulus presentation and response
phase. although this procedure has mainly been used to examine
memory functions (see section 4.5), it can also be employed for
the evaluation of drug effects on stimulus discrimination, i.e., discrimination is expected to be the strongest at the zero-delay and
gradually declines as a function of the length of the delay (heise and
milar, 1984). moreover, signal detection theory-derived measures
would provide a valuable tool for the evaluation of drug effects on
stimulus discrimination. although the abovementioned arguments
strongly support the use of this method, only few animal studies
have actually done so.
several studies have indicated that scopolamine can have differential effects on discrimination performance, as it has been
reported to inﬂuence accuracy, response latency and missed trials
(e.g., drinkenburg et al., 1995). for instance, a study by bushnell
et al. (1997) showed that scopolamine (0.03, 0.056, 0.1 mg/kg
sc) decreased p(hit)—an effect which was dependent on stimulus intensity, increased p(false alarm), number of omissions and
reaction time. an additional problem with interpreting effects of
scopolamine on discrimination performance is the fact that the
dose at which performance is impaired varied a lot between studies: effects on discrimination accuracy have been reported for doses
between 0.005 (kirk et al., 1988) and 2.0 mg/kg (robinson et al.,
2004). it has been suggested that this could be due to differences
in salience between stimuli (see above andrews et al., 1992), since
discrimination of relatively non-salient stimuli appears to be more
easily disrupted by scopolamine (evans, 1975). however, task difﬁculty cannot fully account for all discrepancies that exist between
experiments. of note, scopolamine appears to inﬂuence not only
visual discrimination (probably due to its peripheral effects on
pupil diameter and lens accommodation) but also auditory discrimination (ison and bowen, 2000; jones and shannon, 2000a;
sipos et al., 2001; van haaren and van hest, 1989), but does not
seem to impair olfactory discrimination (doty et al., 2003). the second ﬁnding suggests that scopolamine can also inﬂuence central
sensory processes. indeed, studies which used central infusion of
scopolamine have implicated the (dorsal) hippocampus (brito et
al., 1983; carli et al., 1999, 1995) and (periform, dorsomedial prefrontal and ventromedial prefrontal) cortex (broersen et al., 1995;
herremans et al., 1997; wilson, 2001) in discrimination processes.
in summary, stimulus discrimination is very sensitive to scopolamine treatment, especially when delayed response tasks and/or
signal detection theory-derived measures are used to analyze per-

formance. however, it should be noted that not all studies have
reported scopolamine-induced discrimination deﬁcits (harder et
al., 1998). effects of scopolamine on missed trials and increased
response latencies tend to be relatively more consistent. in particular, doses as low as 0.005 and 0.025 mg/kg were able to decrease
the sensitivity parameter (herremans et al., 1995; kirk et al., 1988).
furthermore, effects of scopolamine on visual discrimination could
be (partly) caused by pupil dilation (leopold and comroe, 1948),
and hence may not be necessarily caused by central cholinergic
blockade only.
4.4. attention
several studies have speciﬁcally evaluated the effects of scopolamine on tasks that were developed to study attentional processes
in rodents. a relatively older study by cheal (1981) attempted to
assess the role of acetylcholine in either memory vs. behavioral
disinhibition vs. stimulus selection in gerbils. by using an object
recognition test, it was determined that scopolamine treatment
(0.1–10 mg/kg, sc) did not affect memory performance, response
inhibition or stimulus selection. however, based on the duration
that the gerbils inspected the objects it was concluded that scopolamine probably impaired the maintenance of attention.
in the 5-choice serial reaction time task scopolamine (0.03,
0.075, 0.1 mg/kg, sc) was found to impair performance accuracy
under normal conditions (i.e., standard light intensity and no interfering stimuli) only at the highest dose tested (jones and higgins,
1995). however, these effects became more apparent when a burst
of white noise was introduced during the inter-trial interval. it
was suggested that these data underscored the notion that the
cholinergic system is involved in selective attention. similar to the
aforementioned studies, scopolamine (0.075 and 0.1 mg/kg) also
increased the number of missed trials. subsequently, a revised
version of the 5-choice serial reaction time task was developed
which supposedly could dissociate drug effects on attentional vs.
motivational or motor processes (higgs et al., 2000). it was found
that scopolamine (0.03, 0.075, 0.1 mg/kg, ip) did not affect accuracy performance in this modiﬁed version. on the other hand, at a
dose of 0.075 mg/kg a clear increase in response latency and number of omissions was observed. a detailed analysis of signaled vs.
non-signaled trials indicated that the effects of scopolamine could
not solely be due to attentional dysfunctions. these ﬁndings (i.e.,
relatively reliable effects of scopolamine on general performance
measures but no consistent effects on discrimination accuracy
parameters) have been corroborated by other experiments using
the 5-choice serial reaction time task (bartholomew hodges jr. et
al., 2009; callahan et al., 1993; higgs et al., 2000; mcgaughy et
al., 1994; pattij et al., 2007; shannon and eberle, 2006; spinelli et
al., 2006). a study by davidson and marrocco (2000) using central
infusion of scopolamine (4, 7 mg in 1 ml ringer solution) has implicated the intraparietal cortex in attentional shifting (i.e., covert
orienting).
in summary, it appears that the effects of scopolamine on attention tasks are not unequivocal. although different test paradigms
have been utilized that presumably assess sustained attention,
scopolamine did not consistently impair accuracy performance
(andrews et al., 1992; doty et al., 2003; leaton and kreindler,
1972). in addition, scopolamine consistently increased general
non-cognitive performance measures, such as response latency and
the number of missed trials (andrews et al., 1992; bushnell et al.,
1997; drinkenburg et al., 1995). although the use of signal detection theory-derived measures would probably make attention task
performance more sensitive to drug treatments, most studies have
used standard parameters, such as percentage correct and number
of omissions (ksir and slifer, 1982). nevertheless, the consensus
appears to be that scopolamine mainly affects visuospatial sustained attention at doses of 0.02 mg/kg and higher (bartholomew

hodges jr. et al., 2009; callahan et al., 1993; cheal, 1981; hoff et al.,
2007; humby et al., 1999; leblond et al., 2002; spinelli et al., 2006).
in addition, a few experiments have reported effects of scopolamine
on cross-modal (visual and auditory) divided attention (mcgaughy
et al., 1994) and covert orienting of visuospatial attention (davidson
and marrocco, 2000; phillips et al., 2000).
4.5. learning and memory
several papers have given an overview of the effects of cholinergic drugs on learning and memory performance, but not speciﬁcally
related to scopolamine (blokland, 1995; hagan and morris, 1988;
izquierdo, 1989; mcdonald and overmier, 1998; mcnamara and
skelton, 1993; smith, 1988; spencer and lal, 1983). since the
amount of studies in which scopolamine was used to induce performance deﬁcits is tremendous, only a short summary of the effects
of scopolamine on learning and memory will be provided in this
section. a more comprehensive review of the effects of anticholinergic drugs per behavioral task can be found in the papers of hagan
and morris (1988), and spencer and lal (1983).
first of all, object recognition and spatial alternation tasks have
been reasonably consistent in detecting drug effects in the sense
that peripherally administered scopolamine generally tends to
interfere with short-term memory (baron et al., 1998; lieben et
al., 2005; means et al., 1996; sambeth et al., 2007). however, the
effects of scopolamine in operant (delayed) alternation have been
assumed to also be related with discrimination processes (heise et
al., 1976). experiments using central infusion of scopolamine have
implicated the infralimbic cortex (wall et al., 2001), medial septal area (givens and olton, 1995; markowska et al., 1995), caudate
nucleus (prado-alcala et al., 1978) and dorsal hippocampus as brain
regions involved in spatial alternation (brito et al., 1983). infusion of
scopolamine into the perirhinal cortex (abe et al., 2004; warburton
et al., 2003; winters et al., 2007, 2006) impairs object recognition. in
the radial maze, clear performance deﬁcits were generally apparent
after systemic scopolamine administration (masuoka et al., 2006),
although it must be noted that in some studies relative high doses of
scopolamine (≥0.5 mg/kg) were used (okaichi and jarrard, 1982).
in general, doses of 0.1 mg/kg and higher are required to induce
impairments in this task (buresová and bures, 1982; peele and
baron, 1988b; wirsching et al., 1984). apart from the effects on
acquisition, scopolamine especially disrupted performance when
delay procedures were used, which suggests that scopolamine
speciﬁcally impairs (spatial) working memory (buresová and bures,
1982; peele and baron, 1988b; stevens, 1981). moreover, when
utilizing the radial maze procedure in which both working and
reference memory can be assessed simultaneously, studies have
provided support for a speciﬁc effect of scopolamine on working
memory (bartholomew hodges et al., 2009; beatty and bierley,
1985; wirsching et al., 1984). however, the selective disruption of
working memory after scopolamine has been questioned by other
studies (eckerman et al., 1980; godding et al., 1982; okaichi and
jarrard, 1982; okaichi et al., 1989; peele and baron, 1988a). central
infusion of scopolamine in the basal forebrain, dorsomedial thalamus nucleus, medial raphe nucleus (mishima et al., 2000) and
hippocampus (kim and levin, 1996), has been found to disrupt
radial maze performance.
in the morris water maze, systemic administration of scopolamine has been reported to be more effective in disrupting
acquisition than impairing retention (cozzolino et al., 1994).
moreover, it was reported that the effects of scopolamine were
dependent on age and pool wall brightness (paylor and rudy, 1990)
and pretraining (saucier et al., 1996), which suggests that the effects
of scopolamine in the morris task may not only be related with spatial learning. furthermore, some studies have reported that a dose
of at least 0.1 mg/kg was needed to impair place learning (buresová

1341

et al., 1986). in contrast, other experiments showed that higher
doses (i.e., 0.8–1.0 mg/kg, ip) did not impair the acquisition of the
morris task (decker et al., 1990; riekkinen et al., 1990). studies
using central infusion of scopolamine have reported a role for the
posterior cingulate (riekkinen et al., 1995), septum (elvander et
al., 2004) and dorsal hippocampus (blokland et al., 1992; herreramorales et al., 2007) in morris water maze performance.
the majority of studies using delayed (non-)matching procedures have indicated that systemical administration of scopolamine induces a delay-independent impairment at relatively low
doses (0.1 mg/kg and lower; see also steckler et al., 1998), although
other studies have challenged this ﬁnding (estape and steckler,
2002; ruotsalainen et al., 1998; santi and weise, 1995; stanhope
et al., 1995). furthermore, in most experiments scopolamine also
affected measures of responding, i.e., increased number of omissions, decrease in number of completed trials and increase in
response latency (estape and steckler, 2002; kirkby et al., 1995).
experiments using central administration of scopolamine have
implicated the (dorso)medial prefrontal cortex (broersen et al.,
1994; dunnett et al., 1990; herremans et al., 1996), prelimbic cortex (granon and poucet, 1995) and hippocampus (dunnett et al.,
1990; robinson and mao, 1997) in delayed (non-)matching performance.
there exists a multitude of studies that have used scopolamine
to assess the role of acetylcholine in anxiety-related memory
(anagnostaras et al., 1999; roldán et al., 1997; rudy and pugh,
1996; spangler et al., 1989). for instance, in an active avoidance
study by flood and cherkin (1986), relatively low doses of scopolamine (0.01 mg/kg 1 h before training or 0.1 mg/kg immediately
after training, sc) improved retention—probably due to a behavioral activating effect of scopolamine, whereas higher doses of
scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg 1 h before training or 1.0 mg/kg immediately after training, sc) disrupted performance. moreover, these
effects were dependent on time of administration: injection of
scopolamine 1 h before the learning phase was relatively more
effective in altering retention performance as compared to administration immediately after the learning phase (i.e., effects at lower
doses). a study by oliverio (1968) indicated an interaction effect
between the amount of active avoidance pretraining and scopolamine treatment: a dose of 2 mg/kg (ip) ameliorated performance
in naïve mice, whereas a similar dose disrupted performance in
mice which were pretrained. using central infusion of scopolamine
(10–20 ␮g), hamilton and grossman (1969) have reported a role for
the septum in active avoidance in cats.
in several passive avoidance studies (nomura et al., 1994;
quirarte et al., 1994; rush, 1988), systemic administration of scopolamine just before training appeared relatively most effective in
impairing retention measures (as compared to administration at
least 1 h before training, after avoidance training or before avoidance testing). however, it seems that age of the animals is also a
mediating factor in determining the sensitivity of passive avoidance performance to disruption by scopolamine; an article of
feigley (1974) reported effects of scopolamine in 20–28-day-old
rats at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (ip) whereas in 70–84-day-old animals, a dose of 4 mg/kg (ip) disrupted passive avoidance retention.
moreover, amount of pretraining inﬂuenced the effect of scopolamine on passive avoidance performance as well, as a dose of
0.5 mg/kg (ip) was found to impair retention in moderately trained
rats whereas a similar dose had no effect on retention in overtrained animals (pazzagli and pepeu, 1964). lastly, level of shock
intensity also plays a mediating role in the effect of scopolamine
on passive avoidance retention; a study by quirarte et al. (1994)
showed that after a dose of 8 mg/kg (ip) using low foot shock conditions, no state-dependency was found, while the same dose did
have a state-dependent effect when a high level of foot shock
was employed. thus, in avoidance tests effects of systemically

1342

i. klinkenberg, a. blokland / neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews 34 (2010) 1307–1350

administered scopolamine appear to be dependent on the type
of avoidance task (i.e., passive vs. active avoidance), the time of
injection (flood and cherkin, 1986; quirarte et al., 1994), training experience (oliverio, 1968; pazzagli and pepeu, 1964), age of
the animals (feigley, 1974), level of shock intensity (quirarte et al.,
1994), and dose conditions (flood and cherkin, 1986). moreover,
central administration of scopolamine in frontal cortex (santucci
and shaw, 2003), anterior but not posterior cingulate (riekkinen
et al., 1995), hippocampus (wiener and messer, 1973), striatum
(diaz del guante et al., 1991) and amygdala (bianchin et al., 1999;
nomura et al., 1994) tends to disrupt passive avoidance retention.
results of experiments in which the effects of scopolamine
on fear conditioning were investigated tend to be quite variable, which could again be related to modest differences in test
circumstances such as time of administration (anagnostaras et
al., 1999). nevertheless, systemic injection of scopolamine was
most often found to impair both context and cued conditioning
(anagnostaras et al., 1999; rudy, 1996), an effect which might
be mediated by the amygdala (phillips and ledoux, 1992). however, no effects (rudy and pugh, 1996), effects on only context
(anagnostaras et al., 1995) or cued conditioning (young et al.,
1995), and even a facilitation of cued conditioning have also been
reported (young et al., 1995). in contrast, central infusion of scopolamine in the (dorsal) hippocampus has been reported to impair
contextual but not cued conditioning (rogers and kesner, 2004;
wallenstein and vago, 2001). in summary, effects of scopolamine
on tasks assessing learning and memory were observed at systemic doses higher than 0.03 mg/kg (dependent on the particular
paradigm used). it appears that scopolamine is particularly effective in impairing acquisition/learning and short-term and working
memory.
5. discussion
5.1. summary and interpretation of the behavioral effects of
scopolamine
a review of the literature on scopolamine (see tables 2 and 3)
clearly shows that this drug is capable of inducing various behavioral changes in several animal species (bohdanecky et al., 1967;
cheal, 1981; hamilton and grossman, 1969; harvey et al., 1983;
pakarinen and moerschbaecher, 1993; robinson et al., 2004;
santi and weise, 1995; savage et al., 1996; spinelli et al., 2006),
which shows that scopolamine can cause very potent performance
impairment on tests of learning and memory (anagnostaras et al.,
1999; bartholomew hodges et al., 2009; means et al., 1996; roldán
et al., 1997; sambeth et al., 2007; spangler et al., 1989; spinelli
et al., 2006). this would corroborate the view that scopolamine
is an amnesic drug that disrupts central cholinergic neurotransmission. initially, much effort has been made to examine whether
scopolamine disrupts consolidation vs. retrieval, learning vs. memory, short-term vs. long-term memory and working vs. reference
memory. since the most consistent effects are found in tests
in which a delay interval was interposed between the sample
and recognition/choice phase (estape and steckler, 2002; givens
and olton, 1995; savage et al., 1996; stanhope et al., 1995), it
has been argued that scopolamine predominantly affects shortterm memory processes. however, it has become increasingly
clear that tasks that assess stimulus discrimination and/or (sustained) attention are much more sensitive to pick up impairment
after scopolamine treatment (i.e., effects at relatively lower doses,
see fig. 1), especially when signal detection-derived measures
and/or delay procedures are used. these ﬁndings would suggest
a role of acetylcholine in sensory processing and attention rather
than short-term memory (sarter et al., 2003). this conclusion

fig. 1. schematic overview of the dose–response effects of scopolamine in several
behavioral tasks. doses were peripherally administered in rats and mice, as dose
ranges used in monkeys cannot be directly compared with those in rodents. the
left side of the box corresponds with the minimal dose at which effects have been
reported in a particular behavioral task. the brighter boxes on top indicate the occurrence and onset of other (non-cognitive) effects of scopolamine. table 2 provides an
overview of studies which have assessed the effect of peripheral administration of
scopolamine on behaviour.

is strengthened by the fact that cholinergic lesion studies have
yielded comparable results—i.e., on discrimination/attention rather
than learning/memory, see above (e.g., baxter and gallagher, 1996;
baxter et al., 1997; chiba et al., 1999; mcgaughy et al., 2000; torres
et al., 1994; voytko, 1996).
unfortunately, due to the non-speciﬁc binding characteristics
of scopolamine (bolden et al., 1992), cognitive-behavioral effects of
systemic administration are not very selective. in fig. 1, a schematic
overview is made of effects of peripheral administration of scopolamine as a function of behavioral paradigm. as is shown, with
increasingly higher doses scopolamine can also impair performance in behavioral tasks which assess non-mnemonic and/or
non-attentional processes, such as anxiety (hughes et al., 2004;
smythe et al., 1996). furthermore, scopolamine can inﬂuence noncognitive aspects of behavior: it has a rather robust effect on
locomotor activity (decrease or increase), response rate (decrease),
omissions (increase), and response latency (increase). scopolamine
is also known to affect peripheral, physiological processes such as
pupil size (leopold and comroe, 1948) and salivation (dai et al.,
1991; flynn et al., 1997; shannon et al., 1994; shida et al., 1993;
tobin et al., 2002). these peripheral effects were found in dose
ranges that also disrupt measures of cognitive behavior. thus, use
of (high doses of) scopolamine will affect additional cognitive and
non-cognitive aspects of behavior that could directly interfere with
performance in tasks assessing stimulus discrimination, attention
or memory. as is the case for all drugs, effects of scopolamine on the
abovementioned functions are found to be dose-dependent albeit
that the dose response curves can differ between behavioral tasks
(see fig. 1).
systemic administration of scopolamine hence tends to inﬂuence both peripheral and central mechanisms and therefore effects
on these functions cannot always be dissociated from one another.
hence, systemic scopolamine injections can only have a limited
contribution in understanding the role of the central cholinergic
system in cognition. it is assumed that central infusion of compounds in animals offers information with respect to the function
of a neurotransmitter in a speciﬁc brain region. such an approach

i. klinkenberg, a. blokland / neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews 34 (2010) 1307–1350

would enable an assessment of the inﬂuence of muscarinic receptors in different brain structures on cognitive performance. as
receptor subtypes are not evenly distributed in the brain, central
administration will also lead to differences in blockade between
muscarinic receptor subtypes. thus, studies that investigate the
effects of intracerebral injections may provide a manner to dissociate effects of scopolamine on performance in (non-)cognitive
tasks, especially those in which scopolamine is injected into
more than one brain region (e.g., striatum and hippocampus).
furthermore, it has been suggested that speciﬁc projections of
cholinergic cells in the nucleus basalis diagonal band complex
might provide brain regions with some degree of selectivity in
terms of cognition (price and stern, 1983; van der zee and luiten,
1999).
however, experiments that have used central administration of
scopolamine do not provide a clear-cut picture of the role of the
cholinergic system for each brain region (see table 3): cognitive
deﬁcits seem diverse and only to some extent related to brain structure. for example, short-term memory impairments have been
found after injections in several brain regions, such as the hippocampus (brito et al., 1983; dunnett et al., 1990; herrera-morales
et al., 2007; mishima et al., 2000), septum (givens and olton, 1995;
markowska et al., 1995), and amygdala (ingles et al., 1993; ohno
et al., 1993). moreover, centrally applied drugs are also capable of
exerting widespread effects (e.g., jolas et al., 1995). nevertheless, if
a rough differentiation is made, it seems that the cortical regions are
involved in attentional processes (davidson and marrocco, 2000),
short-term memory functions (abe et al., 2004; granon et al., 1995;
wall et al., 2001; warburton et al., 2003; winters et al., 2006),
(conditional) discrimination (broersen et al., 1995; herremans et
al., 1997; wilson, 2001), and conditioned taste aversion (gutiérrez
et al., 2003; naor and dudai, 1996; ramírez-lugo et al., 2003).
the amygdala and septohippocampal system appear necessary for
anxiety-related behavior (e.g., smythe et al., 1998), and working
and short-term memory (brito et al., 1983; dunnett et al., 1990;
givens and olton, 1995; herrera-morales et al., 2007; ingles et
al., 1993; markowska et al., 1995; mishima et al., 2000; ohno et
al., 1993), although one study did not support the latter conclusion (robinson and mao, 1997). the striatal cholinergic system
appears to modulate cognitive functions such as behavioral ﬂexibility (ragozzino et al., 2002), but also affects the execution of motor
functions (blokland, 1998; chambers and van hartesveldt, 1984;
vrijmoed de vries and cools, 1986).
these ﬁndings would implicate that the cognitive effects of
systemic administration of scopolamine are not mediated by
cholinergic blockade in a number of distinct brain areas but are
rather caused by a nonselective, extensive inhibition of central
cholinergic signaling. it was shown that in vivo administration of
[3 h]-scopolamine (iv over a period of 240 min with a plasma concentration of about 20 nm) could be traced in many brain regions
of the rat (frey et al., 1985). there was a good correlation between
[3 h]-scopolamine binding and receptor density, indicating that this
ligand does not preferentially bind to a speciﬁc brain area. thus,
effects of systemic scopolamine treatment on cognitive function
should be regarded as the end result of widespread blockade of
muscarinic receptors throughout the brain. moreover, studies using
central administration of scopolamine have indicated that the dose
range required to affect different behaviors was comparable among
different brain structures (i.e., 5–15 ␮g). in contrast, the effective dose range of systemically administered scopolamine appears
to be greatly dependent on the particular behavioral task that is
employed. in other words, experiments which have investigated
the effect of central administration of scopolamine on cognition
cannot easily explain the ﬁnding that it more potently affects performance in sensory/stimulus discrimination and attentional tasks
rather than learning and memory paradigms.

1343

in conclusion, the notion that scopolamine is an amnesic drug
cannot be refuted, but as discussed in the present review, the
mnemonic effects of scopolamine may not result from a speciﬁc
effect on learning and memory processes. thus, it is likely that
effects on learning and memory performance which are observed
after higher doses are mediated by (1) primary effects on attention and sensory/stimulus discrimination, (2) non-speciﬁc effects
on behavior (e.g., locomotor activity, anxiety), and (3) peripheral side-effects (e.g., pupil dilation, salivation). at the very least,
a detailed account should be given in order to rule out sideeffects as an underlying cause of apparent memory impairments
observed at higher doses. for each speciﬁc cognitive test, multiparametric studies are needed to assess which dose (or dose range)
of scopolamine induces cognitive deﬁcits without causing behavioral side-effects. in line with a paper in which a low dose of
amphetamine was discussed (grilly and loveland, 2001), scopolamine doses higher than 0.1 mg/kg should be considered as high
doses in rats and mice.
5.2. scopolamine as a model for cognitive impairment
the use of scopolamine in humans may be a useful tool
to investigate the role of acetylcholine in cognition. however,
animal studies have shown that this type of research, i.e., peripheral administration of scopolamine, suffers important limitations
because of the reasons that have been delineated in this paper.
scopolamine blocks acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in a nonselective manner (bolden et al., 1992); because of this widespread
mode of action it may not be the optimal choice as a model of
(muscarinic and/or cholinergic) cognitive impairment. on basis
of the localization of different muscarinic receptors subtypes (see
table 1), it may be more useful to use ligands that block muscarinic
receptors more selectively and thus are likely to affect cognitive
function in a relatively more speciﬁc manner.
in this respect it might be interesting to explore the usability of selective muscarinic m1 antagonists as a pharmacological
model of cognitive deﬁcits. as the  xxxg447xxx  is predominantly
located centrally and in brain regions such as cortex and hippocampus which are thought to be important for learning and
memory (caulﬁeld, 1993), it is expected that m1 antagonists will
exert less peripheral side-effects as compared to scopolamine and
will impair cognition (especially memory) more selectively. this
would supposedly make interpretation of the effects of selective m1 antagonists on cognition relatively more straightforward.
moreover, muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  agonists have been pursued
as treatment option for alleviation of cognitive impairments seen
in disorders such as (alzheimer’s) dementia (bodick et al., 1997)
or schizophrenia (shekhar et al., 2008): unfortunately, with limited success due to a lack of ligand selectivity to the  xxxg447xxx 
(heinrich et al., 2009). thus, selective m1 antagonists might constitute a relatively more valid pharmacological model of cognitive
impairment as compared to the non-speciﬁc muscarinic antagonist
scopolamine.
5.3. muscarinic m1 antagonists
several studies have used selective m1 antagonists to assess
the role of the muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  in cognition and behavior.
deﬁcits have been reported in passive avoidance tasks (fornari et
al., 2000; kimura et al., 1999; kramer-soares et al., 2006; roldán
et al., 1997), contextual fear conditioning (kramer-soares et al.,
2006) and object recognition (myhrer et al., 2004, 2008) after
administration of m1 antagonists. to the best of our knowledge,
only the muscarinic m1 antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  has been infused
into distinct brain areas to determine its effects on cognition.
when administered in the insular cortex,  xxxd2965xxx  (100 mm

1344

i. klinkenberg, a. blokland / neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews 34 (2010) 1307–1350

in 1.0 ␮l/side) was reported to affect acquisition of conditioned
taste aversion, but did not affect retrieval (ramírez-lugo et al.,
2003). moreover, hippocampal or intracerebroventricular injection
of  xxxd2965xxx  (0.32–34.55 ␮g) affected spontaneous alternation
and caused performance deﬁcits in the morris water maze (hagan
et al., 1987; herrera-morales et al., 2007; hunter and roberts,
1988), t-maze (messer et al., 1990, 1987a,b), radial maze (mishima
et al., 2000; sala et al., 1991), spontaneous alternation (ukai et al.,
1995a,b), delayed matching to position task (andrews et al., 1994;
aura et al., 1997) and the three-panel runway test (ohno et al.,
1994a,b), indicative of an effect of this compound on memory functions. however, there are some indications that de  xxxg447xxx 
might be implicated in processes beyond memory, such as reversal
learning (mccool et al., 2008; tzavos et al., 2004) or anxiety (wall
et al., 2001).
in humans, the m1 antagonist biperiden (2 mg) impaired verbal episodic memory, locomotor behavior, motor learning and/or
attentional processes without causing sedation (wezenberg et al.,
2005). moreover, in human participants scopolamine was generally
found to have a much more widespread effect on cognitive performance as compared to biperiden (ebert et al., 1998; wesnes, 1988).
in these studies, scopolamine was also associated with relatively
more side-effects, such as sedation, accommodation disturbances
and dry mouth. of note, because of the highly conserved nature of
the orthosteric binding site among muscarinic receptors, selectivity of muscarinic ligands for a particular receptor subtype might be
limited and subject to improvement (bolden et al., 1992; heinrich
et al., 2009). in other words, behavioral effects of ‘selective’ muscarinic antagonists that target the orthosteric  xxxg447xxx  site
could also be caused by blockade of muscarinic receptors other than
m1.
6. conclusions
scopolamine has widespread effects on physiological functioning and hence it also has a broad side-effect proﬁle, which can be
explained by the non-selective muscarinic binding characteristics
of this ligand (bolden et al., 1992). moreover, the pharmacodynamic properties of scopolamine might give rise to nonselective
effects of this drug on behavioral performance. in other words,
this compound does not possess the appropriate pharmacological
qualities in order to be able to affect just one aspect of cognition
(such as mnemonic or attentional processes). ideally, relating cognitive impairments to the impact of a model ligand on a particular
receptor type should be relatively straightforward. although scopolamine has a strong history as a model for cholinergic impairment,
its pharmacological unspeciﬁcity renders it unﬁt for the use as a
golden standard drug. thus, the validity of scopolamine as a drug
of choice for inducing cognitive impairments should be questioned.
ligands which antagonize the muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  can
regarded as good alternatives for scopolamine because of their ability to induce more selective cholinergic receptor blockade. based
on the relatively central distribution of the muscarinic  xxxg447xxx 
(caulﬁeld, 1993), the relatively more speciﬁc cognitive effects of
m1 antagonists (andrews et al., 1994; aura et al., 1997; hagan et
al., 1987; herrera-morales et al., 2007; hunter and roberts, 1988;
messer et al., 1990, 1987a,b; mishima et al., 2000; ohno et al.,
1994a,b; sala et al., 1991; ukai et al., 1995a,b), and the relatively
more favorable side-effect proﬁle of m1 antagonists (ebert et al.,
1998; wesnes, 1988; wezenberg et al., 2005), it can be argued that
these compounds should be investigated in terms of their usability as a pharmacological model of cognitive impairment. however,
at this point, not enough effort has been put in determining the
effects of m1 antagonists on memory vs. attention vs. other cognitive and non-cognitive processes (side-effects), partly because of a
lack of highly selective muscarinic compounds (bolden et al., 1992;

heinrich et al., 2009). more research is needed to develop m1 ligands with a more selective binding proﬁle (for instance by acting at
targeting allosteric sites for a particular muscarinic receptor type)
and to assess whether m1 antagonists can really be regarded as
a valid pharmacological model for inducing cognitive (particularly
mnemonic) deﬁcits.
