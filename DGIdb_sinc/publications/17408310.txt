abstract

introduction: the bradford hill criteria are a widely used, useful tool for the
assessment of biomedical causation. we have examined their application to
pharmacovigilance using the example of  xxxd1708xxx -induced qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia.
methods: a literature search was conducted using medline, embase, reactions weekly and regulatory websites to identify evidence for the association
between  xxxd1708xxx  and qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia that had been published in the english language. two hundred and five publications were identified
as being potentially suitable for the study. after excluding irrelevant articles,
studies on high-risk populations and review articles, 70 publications were
assessed using the bradford hill criteria. these included 24 case reports, case
series or spontaneous report summaries; eight epidemiological studies; 22 clinical
studies; and 16 experimental (in vivo and in vitro) publications.
results: the most compelling evidence for an association between  xxxd1708xxx  use
and qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia came from case/spontaneous reports
and biological plausibility. considering the rare incidence of serious cardiac
events, these criteria formed the basis for the strength of the association. the
number of reports from different populations showed consistency. specificity was
supported by clinical and cardiographic characterisation of the events. there were
temporal relationships between the events and the initiation of  xxxd1708xxx  treatment,
increases in the dosage and the receipt of interacting medications. the relationships between the adverse events and the latter two factors exhibited biological
gradients. experimental evidence could be found from biological models, as well
as reports of positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge found in individual patients.
 xxxd1708xxx  was found to bind the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx )
 xxxg1232xxx , which provides a plausible mechanism for qtc interval
prolongation/arrhythmia. other qtc interval-prolonging/arrhythmic drugs that
also bind to  xxxg1246xxx  provided an analogy for  xxxd1708xxx  causing qtc interval
prolongation/arrhythmia via this mechanism. the evidence provided by clinical
studies was inconsistent, and epidemiological studies failed to demonstrate an
association. nevertheless, this did not prevent the assessment of causation.

discussion: this study showed how different types of evidence found in
pharmacovigilance can be evaluated using the bradford hill criteria. further work
is required to examine how the criteria can be applied to different types of adverse
events and how they may be applied to pharmacovigilance.

introduction
the bradford hill criteria for causal association
were first described in a lecture given in 1965 by sir
austin bradford hill to the section of occupational
medicine of the royal society of medicine.[1] in the
lecture he considered nine criteria that may be used
in the assessment of causation: strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experimental evidence and
analogy.[1] recent publications by shakir and layton[2] and shakir[3] have put forward some thoughts
on the application of the bradford hill criteria in
pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology.
 xxxd1708xxx  is a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent
(launched in the uk in early 1989) that was withdrawn from the uk market in 2000 because of
safety concerns.[4] it was found to increase the risk
of qtc interval prolongation and cause serious cardiac arrhythmias (torsade de pointes), particularly in
patients who used contraindicated medications that
increased its plasma concentration. despite warnings to avoid the concomitant use of contraindicated
medications, it continued to be inappropriately prescribed.[5-10] a prolonged qtc interval is a risk
factor for the development of torsade de pointes,
which is a serious ventricular tachyarrhythmia
characterised by ‘twisting of the points’ at the cardiac axis.[11-13] qtc interval prolongation is defined as
a qtc interval (qt interval ‘corrected’ for heart
rate) of >440ms in males and >460ms in females.
however, arrhythmias tend to be associated with
values of ≥500ms.[11] in this study, we identify published evidence for the association between
 xxxd1708xxx  and qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia
and examined how the bradford hill criteria could
be used in the assessment of causation. using the
association between the use of  xxxd1708xxx  and serious
cardiac arrhythmias as a model, we assess the suitability of applying the criteria to the types of evidence
that may be available for the assessment of causation.

method
a literature search was conducted using free text
and index terms related to  xxxd1708xxx  and qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia and general adverse
event terms (terms available on request) in medline (1965 to october 2005) and embase (1974
to october 2005). further searches were conducted
in the cochrane library (2005, issue 4), reactions
weekly (1990 to october 2005) and regulatory websites (the european agency for the evaluation of
medicinal products [emea], the medicines and
healthcare products regulatory agency [mhra],
the us food and drug administration [fda],
health canada, the australian therapeutic goods
administration and new zealand’s medsafe). we
sought to identify evidence published in the english
language of the association between  xxxd1708xxx  and
qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. specific review articles and systematic reviews were examined
for any further publications, as were the reference
sections of all articles identified by the literature
search.
publications were excluded from this analysis if
they were non-english articles; studies or review
articles that did not specifically examine cardiac
effects associated with  xxxd1708xxx ; drug utilisation
studies; or experimental studies using  xxxd1708xxx  as a
reference compound for validation tools to detect
qtc interval-prolonging drugs (to ensure that only
the evidence relevant for the assessment of causation was included). clinical studies conducted in
high-risk populations, e.g. premature neonates, infants aged <3 months or subjects undergoing dialysis, were initially obtained but subsequently excluded from the study, because of possible effects of
these conditions on cardiac findings. case reports
involving overdose or poisoning were also excluded, as were those where it was uncertain whether
 xxxd1708xxx  was involved. where the same results
were published more than once, only the publication
containing the results most relevant for this investidrug safety 2007; 30 (4)

gation was assessed. validation was undertaken by a
second review of the search results to ensure that no
articles had been missed and that the inclusion criteria had been applied consistently.
relevant information from the articles was extracted into a database, by one of the authors (mp).
each piece of evidence was assessed using the following bradford hill criteria: strength (numerical
measure of the association); consistency (was the
same trend observed across studies); specificity
(specific event caused by a specific mechanism);
temporality (drug taken prior to event, time to onset); biological gradient (evidence of a dose response); plausibility (biologically plausible mechanism); coherence (coherent with drug causing the
effect); and experimental evidence (biological/
clinical experiments, dechallenge/rechallenge).
analogy was assessed separately, using information
from the main articles as well as additional references. the evidence was classified by mp according
to the criteria met, and any uncertainties were discussed with the other authors. we noted that there
was considerable overlap between several of the

criteria. this led us to group some of the criteria
together, and in particular we considered plausibility, coherence and experimental evidence under one
heading. we subsequently found that this is similar
to the description of causal criteria in the us surgeon general’s report on the association between
smoking and lung cancer.[14,15]
results
figure 1 shows the selection of publications for
inclusion in the study. the initial literature search of
medline and embase identified 1148 references. after removing 182 duplicates, 966 references remained. of those references, 171 were examined further, as were 34 references from other
sources. a total of 70 publications, including experimental studies, were assessed using the bradford
hill criteria. evidence identified from regulatory
websites was also examined, as were other relevant
publications for background or additional information. figure 2 shows the study types identified in this
investigation and what criteria were fulfilled by the
different types of evidence.

strength of the association

no clinical or observational studies provided evidence of the strength of the association. two cohort
studies both showed relative risks of 1.6, but neither
result was statistically significant (95% cis 0.9,
2.9[16] and 0.67, 3.82,[17] respectively). other population studies were unable to provide sufficient evidence for an association.[18-21] case-control studies
had also estimated the risk of qtc interval-prolonging drugs, including  xxxd1708xxx , for arrhythmia[22] and
sudden cardiac death (non-cardiac drugs only).[23] in
an overall assessment of all qtc interval-prolonging
drugs, the adjusted odds ratios (ors) were 1.2 (95%
ci: 0.8, 1.9)[22] and 2.7 (95% ci: 1.6, 4.7),[23] respectively. in only one of these studies was a separate
analysis carried out for  xxxd1708xxx  (or 1.2 [95% ci:
0.8-1.9]). however, there were only four cases and
29 controls included in that analysis.[23] the limitations of some of the observational studies for the
assessment of  xxxd1708xxx -induced arrhythmia have
been discussed in a previous publication,[24] with the
major factor being the rarity of the event, making it
impractical for studies of a sufficient size to be
conducted.[24] in pharmacoepidemiology, it is rare to
find a relative risk >2 for serious adverse events,[3]
but, as this example demonstrates, a lack of strength,
and more importantly a lack of an association (in
terms of measures of association such as relative
© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

risks), does not necessarily rule out causation. however, caution must be taken to ensure that this is not
used to promote false associations.
consistency

evidence for the consistency of the association
between  xxxd1708xxx  and qtc interval prolongation/
arrhythmia is supported by the large number of
cases reported both spontaneously to regulatory authorities/manufacturers and in the published literature. conversely, there were few reports of arrhythmia submitted for drugs prescribed for similar indications to those treated with  xxxd1708xxx .[25] at the time
of the withdrawal of  xxxd1708xxx  in the uk, there were
386 reports of arrhythmia (125 fatalities) and 50
reports of sudden unexplained death related to
 xxxd1708xxx  worldwide.[26] additional publications
have also summarised spontaneous report information.[25,27-29] the case reports described in the literature have come from a number of populations and in
patients with different levels of risk and susceptibility.[30-49] risk factors included the use of interacting
medications, cardiovascular conditions, prematurity
in children and renal failure. very few of the events
occurred in patients without any risk factors, and a
spontaneous report summary showed that only 11%
of cases were not associated with known risk factors
or contraindications.[25,50]
drug safety 2007; 30 (4)

use of the bradford hill criteria in pharmacovigilance

in our analysis, we identified 15 case reports/
series involving 24 adult patients from nine countries.[30,31,33,35,39-49] patients were aged between 18
and 83 years, with a median age of 52 years (interquartile range 40–65 years). there were ten reports
of cardiac events associated with  xxxd1708xxx  in children from three countries (age range 11 days to 8
years). nine children were aged <3 months, including seven who had also been born prematurely, both
of which are risk factors for qtc interval prolongation and arrhythmia.[32,34,36-38] it is of interest that the
majority of cardiac events reported in adult patients
were in older individuals (14 of 24 case reports were
from patients aged ≥50 years) and females (16 of 24
case reports), which is consistent for these also
being risk factors for arrhythmia and torsade de
pointes.[11-13] however, it must also be considered
that the limitation of spontaneous report data is that
it does not provide a denominator, and that reports
are not normally submitted showing the absence of
an event in a patient.
clinical studies were identified in the literature
search if they had assessed the qtc interval or
adverse cardiac effects in patients taking  xxxd1708xxx .
after the exclusion of clinical studies conducted in
high-risk populations (these were non-randomised
studies), 22 clinical studies were examined. studies
were included if they contained a mixed population
of patients with and without these risk factors, as
long as these two patients subgroups had been
analysed separately. the results from the included
clinical studies were inconsistent, and although
some studies provided the suggestion of an association,[51-60] others did not.[61-72] effects of  xxxd1708xxx  on
the qtc interval were observed in a number of
studies.[54-60] in only one of these studies did an
increase in qtc interval prolongation lead to torsade
de pointes.[56] other clinical studies showed that
 xxxd1708xxx  had an effect on heart rate.[51-53] most of
the studies that could be used either to support or
disprove the association could not be described as
definitively providing evidence either way. in some
of the studies, events were observed in individual
patients who were receiving  xxxd1708xxx , but this was
not significantly different compared with a control
group not taking medications in one study,[56] and
another lacked a control group.[58] only one of the
studies was a randomised, controlled trial,[67] and

this did not provide evidence for an association
between  xxxd1708xxx  use and qtc interval prolongation. in another study, it was not clear whether the
effect on qtc interval prolongation was solely due
to  xxxd1708xxx .[54] therefore, it can be considered in
this example that clinical studies provided inconclusive evidence of a consistent association, mainly
because of the rarity of the event.
specificity

when bradford hill[1] came to describe the specificity of the association, he related it to effects being
observed in specific workers and at particular sites
and types of disease. others have argued that the
specificity category is not useful for the assessment
of causation, mainly because of interventions being
able to cause multiple effects.[73] as with all the
criteria, bradford hill stated that caution should be
taken in excluding an association because the criterion was not fulfilled, noting: “… if it is not apparent,
we are not thereby necessarily left sitting irresolutely on the fence”.[1] however, when specificity does
exist, it can aid the assessment of causation. in
pharmacovigilance, specificity is important, because
drugs cause adverse drug reactions by specific
mechanisms.[2,3] in assessing a causal association
between an adverse event and a suspected drug,
specificity can be supportive of causation, and the
lack of specificity weakens a hypothesis of causation. initial reports linked  xxxd1708xxx  to the development of tachycardia.[30] however, tachycardia can
be caused by a number of mechanisms. subsequent
reports documented that  xxxd1708xxx  prolonged the
qtc interval and could lead to the development of
torsade de pointes,[27] and this was found to be
caused by blockade of the human ether-a-go-gorelated gene ( xxxg1246xxx )  xxxg1232xxx .[74,75] in
this example, having an understanding of the biological mechanism helped to define the specificity of
the association, which was supported by the adverse
cardiac events reported spontaneously. although
there are other causes for prolongation of the qtc
interval, such as congenital long qt syndrome, the
use of drugs is a major cause.[11] this does not make
the relationship with the drug certain, but it reduces
the number of other likely causes.

temporality

it is important to know whether a suspected drug
was taken before the onset of the adverse event, and
whether the event was consistent with the timing of
exposure to the medication.[2,3] moreover, the timing
of the event in relation to the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drug can
support or weaken a hypothesis of causation. it is
important to note that the half-life of  xxxd1708xxx  is 10
hours, and there is no accumulation or change in its
metabolism with repeated doses.[26] where information was available from case reports, the median
time to onset after starting  xxxd1708xxx , increasing the
dose or starting an interacting medication was 4.5
days (range 1–15 days).[30,31,33-35,37-41,43-45,47] these
reports described 20 cases of potentially cisaprideassociated qtc interval prolongation or cardiac adverse events and all had a time to onset that indicated causation by  xxxd1708xxx  was feasible. however, for
six case reports and one case series, the time to onset
was not assessable, because of a lack of information.[30,32,33,36,42,48,49]
it can be difficult to assess the time to onset using
observational and clinical studies, as the time between taking the drug and the event is not normally
stated. another problem can be determining compliance, which is a particular problem for observational
studies. in pharmacovigilance it is important to assess the time to onset, and, sometimes, detailed
information on this may only be available from case
reports.
biological gradient

several reports have found that patients experienced qtc interval prolongation after being exposed to a higher-than-usual dose of  xxxd1708xxx . in
one individual, qtc interval prolongation occurred
after increasing the dose of  xxxd1708xxx , and it returned
to normal once the dose was decreased.[31] in another case report, an increase in  xxxd1708xxx  dosage after
the patient was admitted to hospital was potentially
related to the development of arrhythmia.[44] use of
high-dose  xxxd1708xxx  in infants and neonates has been
associated with qtc interval prolongation,[32,36,37]
and in some of these cases a reduction in dose has
led to normalisation of the qtc interval.[36]
© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

although some publications have demonstrated a
clear temporal relationship between plasma
 xxxd1708xxx  concentrations and the qtc interval,[34,55]
other studies have failed to demonstrate any association.[57,66,68,72] in another study, a statistically significant increase in the qtc interval from baseline was
found only in the high-dose group.[60]
the most compelling evidence of a dose-response relationship for  xxxd1708xxx -induced qtc interval prolongation has come from studies reporting
drug interactions.  xxxd1708xxx  is mainly metabolised
by the cytochrome p450-3a4 (cyp3a4) enzyme,
and coadministration with other medications that are
known to inhibit the activity of cyp3a4 increases
the bioavailability of  xxxd1708xxx .[50,76-78] such circumstances have been associated with a large proportion
of the spontaneously reported cases of cisaprideinduced qtc interval prolongation.[25-29,78] from the
case reports identified in the published literature, 12
involved potential drug interactions and provided
information on 15 patients. the most likely potentially interacting medications were all cyp3a4 inhibitors and included erythromycin (six reports),[31,33,35,41,47] clarithromycin (four),[39,43,44]
paroxetine,[45]
diltiazem,[42]
itraconazole,[49]
[41]
ketoconazole, and fluconazole and/or erythromycin.[34]
 xxxd1708xxx  drug interactions have also been
demonstrated in some clinical studies.  xxxd1708xxx 
levels were increased 3-fold when it was coadministered with clarithromycin.[55] in another study, two
individuals who developed arrhythmia whilst receiving  xxxd1708xxx  were subsequently found to have
been taking macrolides.[56] a clinical survey of drug
interactions found that a combination of  xxxd1708xxx 
and erythromycin significantly increased the qtc
interval by 113ms (95% ci 0.3, 226).[59] another
study showed that coadministration of  xxxd1708xxx  and
 xxxd3232xxx  increased the qtc interval by 7.8%.[54]
however, there was no assessment of the effects of
 xxxd1708xxx  alone ( xxxd3232xxx  can also prolong the
qtc interval).
the mechanism of action of  xxxd1708xxx  on the
 xxxg1246xxx   xxxg1232xxx  is dose dependent, and
potassium currents are inhibited to a greater extent
as the dose is increased.[74,75,79-82] this provides a
plausible explanation for cardiac adverse events

use of the bradford hill criteria in pharmacovigilance

tending to be associated with higher doses of
 xxxd1708xxx .
plausibility, coherence and
experimental evidence

we considered that, with regard to assessing
causation in pharmacovigilance, there was sufficient
overlap between the categories of plausibility, coherence and experimental evidence to consider these
criteria under one heading. we selected references
where the effect of  xxxd1708xxx  in relation to qtc
interval prolongation/arrhythmia was examined. to
limit repetition and the retrieval of unnecessary references, articles were not retrieved if  xxxd1708xxx  was
used as a reference compound in biological models
of qtc interval prolongation.
 xxxd1708xxx -induced arrhythmia is an example
where different theories about the mechanism of the
adverse effect were proposed before the currently
accepted mechanism was identified. at the time of
the first report of  xxxd1708xxx -related tachycardia, it
was suggested that  xxxd1708xxx  may exert a procainamide-like effect.[30] an alternative explanation
was that it involved the serotonin  xxxg1117xxx  receptor,[83]
and  xxxd1708xxx  was proposed to cause arrhythmia via
this receptor through a pathway involving atrial
fibrillation.[84] however, subsequent studies and reports demonstrated that  xxxd1708xxx  led to ventricular
arrhythmia,[85,86] and that the 5ht4 receptor was not
involved.[87] subsequently, the mechanism of
 xxxd1708xxx -induced arrhythmia was found to be
caused by blockade of the  xxxg1246xxx  inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx .[74,75] further research has
provided a more detailed understanding of the
mechanism.[79-82,88-92] in these studies, the effect of
 xxxd1708xxx  was observed in a number of animal models, including guinea pigs, cats, dogs and rats.[86,88,92]
it must be noted that this is not a comprehensive list,
because studies using  xxxd1708xxx  as a reference compound were not retrieved. from a biological perspective, the finding that  xxxd1708xxx  causes these effects in a number of biological models adds to the
consistency of the association.
experimental evidence can be found in case reports if dechallenge and/or rechallenge has taken
place. it also adds further evidence to support the
temporal relationship between use of the drug and
the onset of the event. amongst the case reports and

case series describing  xxxd1708xxx -induced qtc interval prolongation, 32 of 34 cases provided information that patients recovered or were improved when
 xxxd1708xxx  was withdrawn, the dosage was decreased
or an interacting medication was discontinued.[30,31,33-35,39-49] the remaining two cases lacked
information on the effect of dechallenge[30,42] five of
the 34 cases from case series or reports documented
rechallenge,[30,38,39] and there was a positive rechallenge in all but one of them.[39] however, this patient
has resumed treatment with  xxxd1708xxx  at a lower
dosage and discontinued use of an interacting medication. in one patient, rechallenge occurred on three
occasions and all of these had positive results.[30] an
early spontaneous report summary found two cases
where rechallenge occurred,[29] and another provided details of a male who had positive dechallenges
and rechallenges on two separate occasions.[25] in a
clinical study, 18 of 22 patients taking  xxxd1708xxx  had
evidence of tachycardia, and when it was withdrawn
the heart rate normalised in 14 individuals.[53]
twelve of these 14 individuals were rechallenged
and in all of these patients the heart rate increased
again.
analogy

there are many analogous examples of other
drugs that can cause qtc interval-prolonging and
arrhythmogenic effects through the  xxxg1246xxx  channel.[93-96] we considered an important analogy to be
that with terfenadine, because it facilitated the identification of the biological mechanism. in the 1980s,
there were a large number of reports of syncope,
qtc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes
associated with terfenadine, and it was subsequently
discovered that the effect was mediated through the
 xxxg1246xxx  channel.[97,98] the product of the  xxxg1246xxx 
gene, ikr, was investigated because of its known
involvement in the hereditary long qt syndrome.[99]
other analogous examples of drug-induced cardiac
effects mediated through the  xxxg1246xxx  channel that
were known at the time of the identification of
 xxxd1708xxx  binding to the  xxxg1246xxx  receptor included
dofetilide-induced cardiac effects[100] and  xxxd236xxx -induced cardiac effects.[98] as this example
demonstrates, using analogous examples such as
these can make it easier to understand the biological
plausibility of an association between an adverse

event and drug administration, which, in turn, can
aid the assessment of causation. however, some
analogies can be more useful than others, and, where
analogy does not exist, this does not rule out causation.
summary

in this study, we have examined the application
of the bradford hill criteria to assess the causal
relationship between  xxxd1708xxx  administration and
qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. the evidence
that contributed to the assessment of causation is
summarised in table i.
in understanding and interpreting the criteria for
causation, it is also important to consider other
variables, such as the type of event (incidence, immediate versus delayed effects and seriousness), the
medication of interest (frequency of use, formulation and other medications with the same effects on
certain parameters), the quality of the evidence,
potential bias (including publicity bias) and confounding, and whether there is a more likely causal
explanation. however, as the aim of our study was
to examine the application of the bradford hill
criteria using this example as a case study, we felt
that a full pharmacovigilance benefit/risk assessment of the relationship between  xxxd1708xxx  and qtc
interval prolongation/arrhythmia was beyond the
scope of this study.
discussion
the evaluation of benefit/risk is inconsistent,
even when considering important drug safety issues
such as product withdrawal,[101] and although there
are guidelines for benefit/risk evaluation in
pharmacovigilance (e.g. the cioms iv report),[101]
there is a clear need for consistent and scientifically
robust methods to examine the causal association of
drugs with the occurrence of serious adverse effects.
the aim of our study was to use the relatively recent
drug safety issue of  xxxd1708xxx -induced qtc interval
prolongation/arrhythmia as a case study to examine
the application of the bradford hill criteria in the

causation. in epidemiology, the strength of an association is conventionally based on a numerical finding, but considering the rare incidence of serious
cardiac events with  xxxd1708xxx , the strength of the
association was provided by case reports, spontaneous reports and biological plausibility. these reports
provided evidence for the consistency of association, as they were reported from different populations. the specificity was supported by clinical and
cardiographic characterisation of the reported
events. temporality was shown by the event occurring soon after initiation of the drug, an increase in
its dosage or the coadministration of an interacting
medication. a biological gradient was demonstrated, as events occurred in patients taking higher
doses of the drug or using interacting medications.
experimental evidence could be found in reports
when dechallenge and/or rechallenge were documented.
the evidence from experimental studies helped
to establish the plausibility, coherence, experimental
evidence and specificity of the event. they also
provided the biological basis for temporality and the
dose response, as well as helping to form the basis of
the strength of the association. this example has
demonstrated that, in the absence of strong evidence
from clinical or observational studies, characterisation of the biological mechanism can facilitate the
assessment of causation. however, caution must be
taken in other situations, as the plausibility could be
misleading or unclear. the preclinical assessment
for qtc interval prolongation by new drugs[102]
shows how biological plausibility is used for decision-making in the drug development process. in
this context, the surrogate marker (the effect of the
drug on the length of the qtc interval) is used to
predict whether new chemical entities have the potential to cause arrhythmia, and therefore perturb
further clinical development of those compounds
considered to be potentially arrhythmogenic. however, it must be noted that the relationship between
qtc interval prolongation and the development of
torsades de pointes is complex, and that torsades de
pointes can occasionally occur without any substantial prolongation of the qtc interval.[11] further
investigation and evaluation of the assessment of
biological plausibility is required,[103] and in particular of whether a strong biological plausibility should

allow smaller relative risks to be accepted when
establishing causation.[3]
in this analysis, there was a lack of evidence from
epidemiological studies, some of which were validation studies conducted in order to assess the association between  xxxd1708xxx  use and qtc interval prolongation.[16,17] this was mainly because of the rarity of
the event making it unfeasible to conduct studies of
sufficient size, as well as biases in the study designs
making it hard to demonstrate an association.[24] the
only available quantitative estimates of the association were therefore risk estimates based on spontaneous reports and utilisation data.[27]
most of the clinical studies that provided evidence for the association were considered, in evidence-based medicine terms, to be poor quality as
they tended to be non-randomised, have no comparator groups and/or be conducted in very small numbers of individuals. thus, most studies did not account for possible bias or confounding, nor did they
have the power to detect an association between
 xxxd1708xxx  use and the cardiac adverse effects.[104]
although it may be argued that if better-quality
randomised, controlled trials had been available
they may have added to the strength of the association, the rarity of the event means that the feasibility
of conducting randomised, controlled trials capable
of demonstrating a clear association is low. the
hierarchy of evidence[104] (which serves well in assessing efficacy) is not always useful and can even
lead to confusion in examining the safety of
medicines, because most of the evidence available
for evaluation is derived from non-randomised studies.[105] although this calls for enhancement of the
evidence used to address safety questions,[106] double-blind, randomised, controlled trials may not always be the best method for this purpose, because of
problems such as the small numbers of patients
studied and the exclusion of patients at high risk for
the development of adverse drug reactions. however, notwithstanding these limitations, there is a place
for randomised clinical trials in studying the safety
of medicines.
it is apparent that current procedures in
pharmacovigilance do use elements of the bradford
hill criteria for the assessment of causation. the

who criteria for the assessment of individual case
reports have a number of terms that are similar to the
bradford hill criteria.[3] the fda uses an adapted
version of the bradford hill criteria for the assessment of birth defects.[108] although not a
pharmacovigilance issue, the department of health
in the uk has used the bradford hill criteria for the
assessment of the link between alcohol and breast
cancer.[109] there have been several other published
examples where drug safety issues have been assessed using the bradford hill criteria.[110-114] however, in some of these examples it is unclear whether
the literature was selected in a systematic manner or
what evidence has been used to fulfil a particular
criterion. these publications also appeared to treat
the criteria as a checklist and did not consider their
limitations.
the criteria are open to interpretation and there
are no guidelines regarding the implication of not
meeting one or more of the criteria and how this
affects the value of the other evidence. when a
particular criterion is not met questions should be
asked, for example, whether there is a reason why
this criterion has not been met and whether the
association could still be considered causal. otherwise, there is the danger that causal associations
may be disregarded despite evidence to the contrary,
or vice versa. as the example we have used demonstrates, pharmacoepidemiological studies (because
of their limitations) fail to indicate a true association
under some circumstances.
studies have also found that the bradford hill
criteria are used inconsistently by investigators, with
certain criteria being excluded without explicit reasons being given for their exclusion.[115,116] in our
analysis, we realised that it was hard to consider all
of the criteria independently and that there was
overlap between some of the categories. we discovered that our grouping of plausibility, coherence and
experimental evidence was similar to the use of
causal criteria in the us surgeon general’s report
on smoking.[14,15,115] other instances where there
could be overlap include strength and consistency,
as well as temporality being related to the biological
gradient and experimental evidence (particularly
when considering dechallenge and/or rechallenge).
in this example, because of the nature of the
event that we studied, most of the evidence came
drug safety 2007; 30 (4)

use of the bradford hill criteria in pharmacovigilance

from spontaneous reports even though we conducted an extensive literature search. however, this does
not diminish the importance of evaluating all types
of evidence from the published literature and other
sources in the assessment of causation in drug safety. spontaneous reports were sufficient to demonstrate a causal association in this example, because
torsades de pointes is rare and occurs only in a few
instances,[11] whereas an event such as myocardial
infarction occurs commonly and would require additional evidence. this pertains to different types of
evidence having different weightings under different circumstances, which would be an important
point to consider when adapting the bradford hill
criteria for use as a global pharmacovigilance tool.
future work should also try to establish how
causation can be assessed for events with different
levels of incidence and characteristics, as well as
considering the baseline rate of the event in the
population being studied.[117] further evaluation
may also be warranted to determine what aspects of
the different types of pharmacovigilance data can be
assessed using the bradford hill criteria, and whether modification of the criteria is required to accommodate the nature of the evidence used in
pharmacovigilance, such as the predominance of
spontaneous and literature case reports and the paucity of randomised clinical trials. the creation of
clear guidelines may help enable the assessment of
causation with more scientific rigour in the future.
we acknowledge the limitations of applying the
bradford hill criteria to a drug safety issue retrospectively. our objective was to examine the application of the bradford hill criteria for decisionmaking in pharmacovigilance, using  xxxd1708xxx  as a
case study.  xxxd1708xxx  is a good example for a case
study, because there was a good body of evidence in
the public domain about its cardiac safety. furthermore, the use of past drug safety issues as examples
may help to educate and improve the systems that
are in place for the assessment of causation in the
future. in this work, the exclusion of non-english
articles, clinical studies conducted in high-risk
populations, and experimental studies using
 xxxd1708xxx  as a reference compound has meant that
we have not evaluated every single piece of published evidence. however, by searching the reference sections of retrieved articles we ensured that all

the most important references were evaluated. we
identified several reports that summarised spontaneous report data (we did not evaluate individual spontaneous reports). therefore, reanalysing individual
cases was considered to be unnecessary for the
purpose of this study. the evidence we identified by
systematically searching the medical literature is
consistent with the cited evidence used to support
the withdrawal of  xxxd1708xxx .[105]
conclusion
to summarise, we have used the example of
 xxxd1708xxx -induced qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia to examine how the bradford hill criteria
can be used for assessing causal associations in
pharmacovigilance. this example has shown that it
is important to consider all types of data in the
assessment of causation. it was possible, in the case
of  xxxd1708xxx -induced qtc interval prolongation/arrhythmia, to attribute causality in pharmacovigilance on the basis of biological evidence and individual case reports. this calls for broadening the
data sources used in the assessment of causation in
pharmacovigilance and for all data sources to be
given proportionate and appropriate emphasis. further work is needed to examine what evidence is
required to establish causation for different types of
adverse events and to establish how this information
can be applied to the practice of pharmacovigilance.
