00200.2001.—contribution of k⫹ channels derived from the
expression of erg, kcnq, and kcne subtypes, which are
responsible for rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier
k⫹ currents (ikr and iks, respectively) in cardiac myocytes, to
membrane currents was examined in stomach circular
smooth muscle cells (smcs). the region-qualified multicell
rt-pcr showed that erg1/kcne2 transcripts were expressed in rat stomach fundus and antrum smcs and that
 xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  transcripts were expressed in antrum but
not fundus. western blotting and immunocytochemical analyses indicate that erg1 proteins were substantially expressed in both regions, whereas  xxxg1245xxx  proteins were
faintly expressed in antrum and not in fundus. both ikr- and
iks-like currents susceptible to e-4031 and  xxxd2343xxx , respectively, were identified in circular smcs of antrum but
only ikr-like current was identified in fundus. it is strongly
suggested that ikr- and iks-like currents functionally identified in rat stomach smcs are attributable to the expression
of erg1/kcne2 and  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx , respectively. the
membrane depolarization by 1 ␮m e-4031 indicates the contribution of k⫹ channels encoded by erg1/kcne2 to the
resting membrane potential in stomach smcs.

excitable membranes display a variety of voltage-gated
k⫹ (kv) channels with different functional properties
(6). in smooth muscles (sms), kv channels play crucial
roles in the regulation of contraction via the control of
membrane potential and excitability (1, 15). electrophysiological properties of k⫹ currents in gastrointestinal (gi) sms are recorded as rapidly activating k⫹
conductance, which may regulate the amplitude of the
upstroke depolarization phase of a slow wave (28, 39).
the molecular basis for electrical rhythmicity in gi
sms has also been substantially clarified (10). rapidly

k⫹ (iks) currents are found in many different cell
types, including neurons and cardiac muscles. they are
major determinants of the threshold firing properties
of neurons (42, 46) and of the repolarization of the
ventricular action potential (31). ikr displays inward
rectification and is selectively blocked by several class
iii antiarrhythmic drugs such as e-4031. on the other
hand, iks is blocked by several class iii antiarrhythmic
drugs, the diuretic agent  xxxd2343xxx , and chromanol
293b and is increased in the absence of external k⫹
(24, 30, 31). in cardiac muscle, the heterogeneity of ikr
and iks density in different areas strongly affects action potential duration and its rate dependence (41). in
gi sms, electrophysiological recordings provide evidence for components of ikr- and iks-like channels (3,
5).
to date, three erg (erg1–3), five kcnq ( xxxg1268xxx –
5), and five kcne ( xxxg1245xxx –4 and 1l) are identified in
mammals. it is well known that the heterologous expression of erg1/kcne2 and  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  results
in k⫹ currents with characteristics similar to those of
endogenous cardiac ikr and iks, respectively (2, 30).
mutations in these genes are responsible for the human genetic disease long qt syndrome (44, 47). recent
studies have confirmed that their subtypes play significant roles in central and peripheral nervous systems.
the expression patterns of heteromeric  xxxg1269xxx /
 xxxg1270xxx  corresponds to the neuronal m channel (43),
and the inheritance in their mutant forms is associated
with benign familial neonatal convulsions (7, 38). also,
 xxxg1271xxx  and  xxxg1268xxx /kcne3 are responsible for dominant deafness in human sensory outer hair cells and
cystic fibrosis in the intestine crypt cells, respectively
(14, 34). the physiological roles of  xxxg1247xxx  and  xxxg1248xxx ,
which are exclusively expressed in mammalian nervous system in contrast to erg1, remain uncertain
(37). in gi sms, the relationship between the molecular components of erg, kcnq, and kcne subtypes
and the functional expression of ikr- and iks-like currents remain unclear.
the aim of the present study is to elucidate the
molecular and functional characterization of ikr- and

erg and kcnq in stomach smooth muscle

iks-like channels in rat stomach smcs on the basis of
both molecular biological and electrophysiological techniques. to address this issue, rt-pcr and western
blotting analyses were initially performed to identify
the molecular components of erg, kcnq, and kcne
subtypes expressed in the rat stomach. subsequently,
to exclude the possible contamination of mrna signal
nonmyocytes, the multicell pcr and immunocytochemical analyses were performed using single sm
cells (smcs). moreover, we investigated whether ikrand iks-like currents could be detected in single smcs
of the rat stomach antrum and fundus using whole cell
patch-clamp techniques and pharmacological tools,
e-4031, and  xxxd2343xxx , which have been shown to
block ikr and iks in cardiac myocytes, respectively (29,
40).
methods

rna extraction and rt-pcr. five- to six-week-old male
wistar rats were anesthetized with ether and killed by bleeding. all experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guiding principles for the care and use of laboratory animals
(the science and international affairs bureau of the japanese ministry of education, science, sports, and culture)
and also with the approval of the ethics committee in nagoya
city university. total rnas were extracted from homogenates of sm layers or mucosa in selected or whole areas of
stomach by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol method
following digestion with rnase-free dnase, and rt was
performed according to gibco brl protocol as previously
described (25). oligonucleotide sequences of primers specific
for erg1–3,  xxxg1268xxx –3,  xxxg1245xxx –2, and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate-dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) of the rat were shown in
table 1. the thermal cycler program used for pcr amplification included a 0.5-min denaturation step at 94°c, a 0.5min annealing step at 55°c, and a 0.5-min primer extension
step at 72°c for 32 or 28 ( xxxg861xxx ) cycles (geneamp 2400,
perkin elmer abi). amplified products were separated on
1.5% agarose gels in tris acetate/edta buffer, visualized
with 1 ␮g/ml ethidium bromide, and documented on fluorimager 595 (molecular dynamics). after recovery from gel

fragments using geneclean ii (bio 101), the amplified
fragments were ligated into pbluescript ii sk(⫹) (stratagene). cloned cdnas were sequenced by the chain-termination method with a dsq-1000l sequencer (shimadzu).
multicell rt-pcr. antrum and fundus smcs of the rat
stomach were isolated using a slight modification as previously reported by muraki et al. (22). individual myocytes
(50–60 cells) were first identified by morphology and then
harvested by using negative pressure through a glass pipette
(30- to 50-␮m tip diameter). the entry of the cells into the
glass pipette was monitored visually, with care taken to
avoid picking up other types of cells. the content of each
pipette was transferred into a sterile tube that contained an
rt reaction solution without rtase. genomic dna was removed by adding 1 unit rnase-free dnase (promega) followed by incubation for 30 min at 37°c. after the sample was
heated for 5 min at 95°c to inactivate dnase activity, rtpcr was performed as described above, but the cycle numbers were increased to 45.
western blotting. membrane fractions of the rat tissues
were prepared using a protocol reported by barry et al. (4),
and protein contents were measured with a protein assay kit
(biorad) with bsa as a standard. rat membrane proteins
(50 ␮g/lane) were fractionated by sds-page (8%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (hybond-p,
amersham pharmacia). after the membranes were incubated into blocking solution (pbs with 1% bsa and 0.1%
tween 20), they were incubated with either the anti-human
erg1 (anti-herg) (1:200 dilution), the anti- xxxg1245xxx  (1:200
dilution), or the anti-large-conductance ca2⫹-activated k⫹
channel (bk; 1:400 dilution) polyclonal antibody (alomone
laboratory) in pbs with 0.1% tween 20 (buffer a) at 4°c
overnight. the next day, membranes were washed three
times with buffer a for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit igg (chemicon) diluted 1:2,000 in buffer a.
an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (amersham pharmacia) was used for the detection of the bound
antibody. resulting images were analyzed by an image
reader (las-1000, fujifilm), and the digitized signals were
quantified with image gauge software (version 3.0, fujifilm).
immunocytochemistry. single antrum and fundus smcs of
the rat stomach were seeded onto glass-bottom dishes, re-

erg and kcnq in stomach smooth muscle

spectively. before staining, isolated myocytes were fixed with
3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. they were subsequently
permeabilized with pbs containing 0.2% triton x-100. nonspecific binding sites were blocked with pbs containing 0.2%
triton x-100 and 1% normal goat serum (buffer b) (4). cells
were then exposed to anti-herg or the anti- xxxg1245xxx  polyclonal antibody diluted 1:50 in buffer b for 24 h at 4°c.
excess primary antibody was removed by repeating washing
with pbs, and the cells were exposed to biotin-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit igg (h & l) antibody (1:200 dilution, chemicon). after 1-h incubation at room temperature, excess secondary antibody was removed by repeating washing with
pbs. then the cells were labeled with fitc-conjugated
streptavidin (1:50 dilution, chemicon). after 1-h incubation
at room temperature, excess streptavidin was removed by
repeated washing with pbs. digital images were viewed on a
scanning confocal microscope (lsm510, zeiss).
electrophysiological measurement. single antrum and fundus smcs were isolated as described above. whole cell voltage and current clamps were applied to single cells with
patch pipettes using a patch-clamp amplifier (cez-2400,
nihon kohden). for electrical recordings, hepes-buffered
solution having the following composition was used as the
external solution (in mm): 137 nacl, 5.9 kcl, 2.2 cacl2, 1.2
mgcl2, 14 glucose, 10 hepes, 0.1 cdcl2, and 0.001 penitrem
a (ph 7.4). in some experiments, high k⫹ solution having the
following composition was used (in mm): 140 kcl, 5.9 nacl,
0 cacl2, 1.2 mgcl2, 14 glucose, 10 hepes, and 0.1 cdcl2 (ph
7.4). when ikr- and iks-like currents were recorded, the
pipette-filling solution contained (in mm) 140 kcl, 0.3 egta,
4 mgcl2, 5 atp-na, and 10 hepes (ph 7.2). all experiments
were done at room temperature (23 ⫾ 1°c). penitrem a and
 xxxd2343xxx  were purchased from sigma.
data storage, data analysis, and statistics. membrane potential and current were stored on videotape after they were
digitized by pcm-recording system (pcm 501 es, sony;
modified a frequency response from direct current to 20 khz).
the data on the videotape were replayed later and loaded
into a computer (ibm-at) through an analog-to-digital converter (data translation; dt 2801a) for analysis by use of
data-acquisition and analysis programs as reported by
imaizumi et al. (12). data analysis was done on a computer
using software (cell-soft) developed at the university of
calgary. pooled data were expressed as means ⫾ se. statistical significance was tested according to dunnett’s test or
paired t-test and is indicated by *p ⬍ 0.05 and **p ⬍ 0.01.

(erg1/kcne2) forms the ikr channel in heart (2).
rt-pcr revealed expression of erg1/kcne2 in heart
and that of erg1/kcne2,  xxxg1247xxx , and  xxxg1248xxx  transcripts in brain (fig. 1a), as has been reported previously. among sm tissues, erg1/kcne2 transcripts
were observed in stomach and urinary bladder,
whereas no or very weak signals were detected in
aorta, colon, ileum, and vas deferens (fig. 1a). in
stomach,  xxxg1247xxx  transcript was also expressed at relatively high levels.
it has been demonstrated that coassembling  xxxg1268xxx 
with  xxxg1245xxx  ( xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx ) forms iks channel in
heart (30) and that the heteromultimer of  xxxg1269xxx  and
 xxxg1270xxx  ( xxxg1269xxx / xxxg1270xxx ) contributes to m-like channels in neuronal cells (7).  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  transcripts
were expressed in heart but not in brain, whereas
 xxxg1269xxx / xxxg1270xxx  were expressed in brain but not in
heart (fig. 1b). in sm tissues,  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  transcripts were expressed in stomach alone, whereas no or
very weak signals were detected in other tissues examined here (fig. 1b). in stomach,  xxxg1270xxx  transcript was
also expressed at relatively high levels compared with
that in brain. these results provide the first description of the expression of both erg1/kcne2 and
 xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  in rat stomach. interestingly, in kidney, erg1–3 and  xxxg1268xxx –3 transcripts were expressed at very low levels, whereas  xxxg1245xxx  and
kcne2 transcripts were expressed at similar levels to
those in brain and heart. similar results were obtained
from six separate experiments.

of whole stomach, and sm layers of lower esophagus
and duodenum. erg1/kcne2 transcripts were expressed at relatively high levels in fundus and antrum
compared with those in esophagus, mucosa, and duodenum (fig. 2a). on the other hand,  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx 
transcripts were expressed at relatively high levels in
antrum and mucosa, whereas no detectable signals
were observed in fundus (fig. 2b). in fundus, faint
signals of both  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1245xxx  were detected
when the amplification cycle was increased to 40 (not
shown). similar results were obtained from eight separate experiments.
expression of erg1 and  xxxg1245xxx  proteins in stomach. wymore et al. (45) have suggested the limitations
in comparing erg1 transcript levels with ikr amplitudes in the absence of the measurements of erg1
protein expression. the expression levels of both erg1
and  xxxg1245xxx  proteins were therefore verified in rat
stomach sms using western blotting. as shown in fig.
3, typical results were obtained by use of the antibodies
specific for erg1 (fig. 3a) and  xxxg1245xxx  (fig. 3b). the
anti-erg1 antibody recognized double bands at 205
and 165 kda in heart as reported by pond et al. (fig.
3a, lane 1) (27). bands of the same sizes were also
detected in stomach (lane 2) and urinary bladder (lane
3) membranes. the densitometric signals in heart were
over twofold more abundant than those in stomach and
urinary bladder. similar results were obtained in four
separate experiments. the signal in heart was specifically blocked when the anti-erg1 antibody was preincubated with the excess antigen peptide against
which the antibody was generated (lane 4). these results are consistent with the results about the expression levels of erg1 transcripts by conventional rtpcr analyses.
on the other hand, the anti- xxxg1245xxx  antibody recognized a single band at ⬃15 kda in heart (fig. 3b, lane
1). strong signal was clearly detectable in heart, but
unexpectedly, only weak signals were detected in stomach (lane 2) and urinary bladder (lane 3). densitomet-

ric analyses revealed that  xxxg1245xxx  protein levels in
heart were ⬎50-fold more abundant than those in
stomach. the signals in heart were also specifically
blocked when the anti- xxxg1245xxx  antibody was preincubated with the excess fusion protein against which the
antibody was generated (lane 4). these findings do not
fit with the results of the expression levels of  xxxg1245xxx 
transcript in stomach by conventional rt-pcr analyses. similar results of western blotting were obtained
from four separate experiments. bk-channel protein
was expressed at relatively high levels in stomach and
urinary bladder but not in heart (fig. 3c). specific
bands were not detected with anti-erg1 and antikcne1 antibodies in membrane fractions from hek293 cells transfected with the cdna of  xxxg1231xxx , 1.4, 1.6,

expression of erg, kcnq, and kcne in smcs of
the rat stomach. to avoid the contamination of signals
from nonmyocytes, multicell rt-pcr analyses were
performed on freshly isolated antrum and fundus circular smcs of the stomach (see methods). as shown in
fig. 4, both erg1/kcne2 and  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  transcripts were expressed in antrum smcs (top) and
erg1/kcne2 were expressed in fundus smcs (bottom). very weak or no detectable signal for  xxxg1268xxx  and
 xxxg1245xxx  was detected in fundus smcs. the signals of
 xxxg1247xxx  and  xxxg1270xxx  were not detected under these conditions but were slightly detected when cycle number
was increased to 50 in antrum alone (not shown). the
negative controls were run by addition of water in

rate experiments. these results are mostly consistent
with those from conventional rt-pcr. interestingly,
when multi cell rt-pcr experiments for the transcripts of erg1/kcne2 and  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  were
performed on freshly isolated longitudinal smcs of the
antrum and fundus (⬃20 cells), results similar to those
in circular smcs were obtained by pcr for 45 cycles
(not shown).
furthermore, to confirm that the identified transcripts are translated into channel proteins and expressed on the surface membranes of antrum and fundus smcs, the subcellular localization of erg1 and
 xxxg1245xxx  protein was examined by an immunocytochemical approach. freshly isolated myocytes from circular sm layers in fundus and antrum were stained
with anti-erg1 antibody, and the local distribution of
immonoreactivity was visualized by laser-scanning
confocal microscopy. the strong staining patterns of
erg1 proteins were localized along cell membrane in
both types of myocytes (fig. 5, a and b). erg1 signals
disappeared after preincubation with the excess antigen (not shown). these results were consistent with
those from both western blotting and multicell rtpcr analyses. similar experiments were performed in
hek-293 cells transfected with the cdna of  xxxg1231xxx ,
 xxxg1237xxx ,  xxxg1244xxx , or  xxxg1259xxx ; resultant immunoreactivity to anti-erg1 antibody was not detected in these
transfectants (not shown).
on the other hand, the fluorescence staining pattern
for anti- xxxg1245xxx  antibody was diffuse in both types of
cells (fig. 5, c and d). in antrum alone, however, weak
and punctuated signals were identified along cell membrane under higher magnification (fig. 5e). immunoreactivity was not detected in both types of smcs that
were treated with control antigen during the incubation with primary antibody (not shown). as a positive
control, immunoreactivity was clearly detected uniformly in hek-293 cells transfected with rat  xxxg1245xxx 
cdna, whereas it was not detected in mock-transfected
hek-293 cells (fig. 5, h and i). it was also found that

discussion

relationship between erg1/kcne2 expression
and ikr in rat stomach sm. erg1 transcript is
widely expressed not only in cardiac muscles but also
in other tissues such as brain, adrenal gland, thymus, retina, and skeletal muscle (30). in the present
study, results obtained by rt-pcr, multicell pcr,
western blot, and immunocytochemistry indicate
that erg1/kcne2 transcripts and erg1 protein
were abundantly expressed in rat stomach smcs at
similar levels to those in heart. particularly, immunocytochemical experiments demonstrated the
strong and homologous staining patterns of erg1
proteins along cell membrane in both antrum and
fundus smcs. the abundant expression of erg1
proteins in the present study is a rather unexpected
finding, because ikr has not been previously reported
in stomach smcs.
western blot analysis of erg1 indicated that 165and 205-kda bands were detected in rat stomach sm
membranes, as has been reported in rat ventricle (27).
a lower molecular mass protein corresponding to the
expression of the alternatively spliced variants of
 xxxg1246xxx  (herg1b, ⬃95 kda) was not detected in rat.
these appear to reflect differentially n-linked glycosylation forms of erg1, which play significant roles in the
regulation of cell surface expression of  xxxg1246xxx  (26).
interestingly, in canine cardiac muscles, the erg1
transcripts are expressed at relatively high levels compared with  xxxg1244xxx  transcripts, which are the most
abundant transcripts in heart, whereas ikr density is
much lower than that of  xxxg1244xxx  current. similarly, in
myocytes of rat ventricle and atrium, rabbit atrium,
and canine ventricle, ikr densities are rather low:
0.36 ⫾ 0.01 (at ⫺30 mv), 0.62 ⫾ 0.03 (at ⫺30 mv), 0.8

(23, 27, 45). the n-linked glycosylation may possibly be
responsible for the expression and functional availability of erg1 proteins in rat stomach smcs, as well as in
cardiac myocytes.
the ikr due to the complex of erg1/kcne2 is characteristic of strong inward rectification at positive potentials and peaked at around ⫺40 mv in the relationship between activation potentials and current
amplitude in cardiac myocytes (2, 23). the outward
current activated at ⫺30 mv in stomach smcs consisted of several voltage-dependent k⫹ currents, and
e-4031-sensitive current could not be clearly resolved
from others in the present study. the current was more
clearly detected as inward current in symmetrical
high-k⫹ conditions, as has been demonstrated using
reconstituted mirp1/herg k⫹ channels (2). on the
basis of the ik,tail amplitude (0.1 pa/pf at ⫺50 mv in
both types of cells in normal solution), however, the
density of e-4031-sensitive current at ⫺30 mv appears
not to be high compared with the levels of erg1
ajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

protein expression. although the kcne2 protein expression was not determined in this study, high levels
of kcne2 mrna were observed in both types of myocytes. kcne2 protein expression must be quantified to
draw a conclusion about the relationship between the
abundance of erg1/kcne2 expression as a coassembly and the functional ikr density.
bk-channel current is the main component of k⫹
currents in rat stomach smcs (not shown) as in other
types of smcs (11, 15). in the immunocytochemical
experiments, erg1 signals in stomach smcs appear to
be stronger than bk signals, whereas the density of ikr
measured as the macroscopic current was much lower
than that of bk-channel current (not shown). the
distribution of bk-channel proteins localized in a clustered fashion on the cell surface in stomach smcs.
channel clustering is rather a common phenomenon in
neurons (19, 20). it has been suggested that, in addition to the simple density of channel proteins, the
distribution pattern, such as clustering, also plays an

essential role in differential posttranslation modification and functional availability of the channels (36).
it is noteworthy that the tail of outward current
activated at ⫺30 mv was reduced by 40–50% in the
presence of 1 ␮m e-4031, which is specific to ikr at this
concentration (31). this finding clearly indicates that
ikr is one of the major components of delayed rectifier
k⫹ current activated by depolarization to ⫺30 mv for
200 ms in smcs of rat stomach fundus and antrum.
 xxxd1708xxx , a gastrointestinal prokinetic drug, was
widely used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and has been associated with qt prolongation torsades de pointes by interacting with unique
sites of the erg1 channel (21). akbarali et al. (3) have
shown that in opossum esophagus smcs, 1 ␮m  xxxd1708xxx  inhibits ikr-like currents and thereby induces
membrane depolarization (⬃10 mv) and phasic contractions. in rat antrum and fundus smcs, application
of 1 ␮m e-4031 induced membrane depolarization (⬃5
mv) under current-clamp mode. these results strongly
suggest that ikr-like current plays an important role to
maintain the resting membrane potential in both antrum and fundus and may possibly contribute to the
regulation of electrical activities by slowing the rate of
slow waves and accelerating the action potential repolarization. although not examined in this study, these
functions of the current may counteract the increase in
muscle tone by depolarization and downregulate the
rhythmic contractility in the stomach sm.
relationship between  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  expression
and functional iks in rat stomach sm. a clear difference in the expression of  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  was found
between smcs in antrum and fundus; the transcripts
of them and  xxxg1245xxx  protein were detected in antrum
smcs. accordingly, k⫹ current sensitive to 100 ␮m
 xxxd2343xxx  was recorded only in antrum smcs. these
results suggest that iks is functional in smcs of antrum but not in those of fundus. because iks is activated at positive potentials with slow kinetics, the
current could be responsible for a repolarizing phase of
slow waves, which are originated in antrum but not
propagated to the fundus region (13). it is notable that
the ik,tail in fundus smcs was totally resistant to 100
␮m  xxxd2343xxx . however, the contribution of iks in
antrum smcs to total membrane current on depolarization was not determined qualitatively. although the
ik,tail at ⫺50 mv was blocked by  xxxd2343xxx  at the
ic50 of 228 ␮m, iks component was not resolved quantitatively from other k⫹ currents.
the major component of voltage-dependent k⫹ currents on depolarization in stomach smcs is apparently
not iks but presumably a-type transient outward k⫹
current encoded by  xxxg1244xxx  in the early part of depolarization (25) and  xxxg1234xxx  and/or  xxxg1237xxx  in the late part
(based preliminary on results using rt-pcr; s. ohya,
unpublished observation). it has been established that
coexpression of  xxxg1245xxx  with  xxxg1268xxx  modifies the
properties of  xxxg1268xxx  and also results in the increment
of the functional k⫹ current (31). therefore, the small
iks in atrum smcs, despite the abundant  xxxg1268xxx 
transcript, is attributable to the low protein levels of
ajp-gastrointest liver physiol • vol

 xxxg285xxx 

 xxxg1245xxx . alternatively, mismatches among transcript,
protein, and functional k⫹ current levels may possibly
occur, as has been shown for voltage-gated kv1 channels in mouse glial progenitors (33) and rat ventricular
myocytes (17, 23).
folander et al. (9) and felipe et al. (8) have reported
that the drastic changes in  xxxg1245xxx  transcript levels
occur in myometrium during late pregnancy and delivery and in kidney and cardiac tissues during development. very recently, lee et al. (16) showed that disruption of the  xxxg1268xxx  gene causes gastric hyperplasia
in mice. in cardiac muscle, the heterogeneity of ikr and
iks densities strongly influences action potential duration (apd) and its rate dependence. viswanathan et al.
(41) showed that the changes in the density ratio of ikr
to iks result in heterogeneity of the repolarization
properties of cardiac myocytes. for example, in the
mouse midmyocardial m cells, smaller density of iks
lengthens apd and iks plays an important role in apd
adaptation. changes in iks density may cause the abnormality in the slow-wave amplitude and frequency in
antrum and result in the gastric hyperplasia in
 xxxg1268xxx -deficient mice.
recent studies have shown that ikr- and iks-like
currents possess obligatory roles in cellular functions
in many noncardiovascular tissues. for example, the
 xxxg1269xxx / xxxg1270xxx  contributes to the native m current,
one of the most important regulators of neuronal excitability (35) and in ng108-15 (neuroblastoma ⫻ glioma hybrid cells) and gh3/b6 (clonal rat pituitary
cells), the erg1/ xxxg1247xxx  contributes to deactivating
erg currents (18, 32). in antrum smcs, not only the
transcripts of erg1 and  xxxg1268xxx , but also those of
 xxxg1247xxx  and  xxxg1270xxx  were expressed, although not very
convincingly in multicell rt-pcr. shi et al. (37)
showed that rat erg1–3 currents expressed in xenopus oocytes are blocked by e-4031 at almost similar
concentrations (dissociation constant ⫽ 100–200 nm).
the possibility therefore cannot be ruled out that
erg1/ xxxg1247xxx  and/or  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1270xxx  heterotetramer(s) might also play some functional roles in antrum of
the rat stomach.
in conclusion, ikr in circular smcs of rat stomach
antrum and fundus is probably due to coexpression of
erg1/kcne2 and possesses rather low density but
significant functional roles to control resting membrane potential in both cell types. iks encoded by combination of  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  may be expressed and
functional only in antrum smcs. although the detailed
functions of ikr- and iks-like currents were not fully
understood, the present findings provide new insights
into the regional differences in the regulation of membrane excitability in stomach sms.
