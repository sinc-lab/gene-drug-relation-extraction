concentration-effect relationship of the positive chronotropic and
hypokalaemic effects of  xxxd2098xxx  in healthy women of childbearing age

received: 7 december 1995 / accepted in revised form: 29 april 1996

abstract objective: to analyse  xxxd2098xxx -induced
tachycardia and hypokalaemia, the most important and
most frequent adverse effects of tocolytic therapy with
b2-adrenoceptor agonists in females of childbearing
age.
methods: the study was performed as a double blind,
randomised, placebo controlled, cross over trial. seven
healthy women aged 22–38 y, received intravenous infusions of  xxxd2098xxx  at 3 different rates
within the therapeutic range for tocolysis (0.5,1.0, and
2.0 µg·min[1 ) and placebo. the time courses of the
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2098xxx  and potassium, and
the heart rate were analysed with mixed effects pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic ( pkpd) modeling
using nonmem.
results: the plasma concentration-time course followed a linear two compartment model. fenoterolinduced tachycardia was described by a linear
concentration-effect model with baseline. the estimated
baseline and slope parameters were 78 beats ·min[1
and 0.032 beats · min[1 ·µg[1 · l, respectively.  xxxd2098xxx -induced hypokalaemia could be described by a
physiological indirect response model including feedback; the estimated basal plasma potassium concentration was 3.93 mmol ·l[1 and the slope factor for

the  xxxd2098xxx -induced relative increase in the efflux
of potassium from the extracellular space was
6.22 * 10[4 ng ·l[1.
conclusion: the estimated population parameters permitted calculation of the expected time course of tachycardia and hypokalaemia in women after the initiation
of tocolysis with  xxxd2098xxx  over the clinically relevant
concentration range, and prediction of its variability.
based on simulation, our model predicted that a continous infusion of 2.0 µg · min[1 (highest rate examined) would increase heart rate to 113 beats·min[1 at
steady state and lower the plasma potassium concentration to 2.77 mmol· l[1 1.5 h after beginning the infusion. thereafter, the plasma potassium concentration
would slowly return to normal.

introduction
 xxxd2098xxx  is an adrenoceptor agonist with predominant
b2-adrenoceptor activity. [1, 2 ]. despite its widespread
use for tocolysis and the treatment of asthma for more
than two decades, very little is known about its concentration-effect relationship. in a previous pharmacokinetic /dynamic study, the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on
parameters of pulmonary function and on heart rate
was analysed in asthmatic patients [3 ]. we recently
reported its pharmacokinetics in healthy females and
in patients treated for premature labour [ 4, 5]. since
tachycardia and hypokalaemia are the predominant
adverse effects after initiation of tocolytic therapy
with b2-adrenoceptor agonists and concentrationeffect data of the drug in women are lacking, we have
now investigated  xxxd2098xxx - induced tachycardia and
hypokalaemia in female subjects. it is known that both
effects are subject to the development of tolerance [6].

whether this would be observed during the first few
hours of administeration of a therapeutic dose was a
further question to be answered.
the data were analysed by mixed effects modeling
in order to determine interindividual, interoccasion
and residual random variability, and to enable simulation of the expected variation of effects in a population [7].

pharmacokinetic /dynamic ( pk /pd) analysis
the pk/pd analysis was performed sequentially. the population
means, the interindividual and occasion-specific variability and
empirical bayesian estimates of the individual, occasion-specific
pharmacokinetic parameters were first determined. subsequently,
the effect data were analysed by keeping individual, occasion-specific
pharmacokinetic parameters fixed. the effects on heart rate and
plasma potassium concentration were analysed separately.

pharmacokinetic model

methods
subjects
seven healthy non-pregnant women, aged 22–38 y (mean 30 y),
were selected for the study. each subject was normal on screening
physical examination and in laboratory tests, including complete
blood cell count, blood chemistry (sodium, potassium, calcium,
chloride, phosphate, creatinine, bun, got, gpt, c-gt, alkaline
phosphatase, glucose, albumine, plasma protein) and electrocardiogram. the subjects had no history of significant illness or surgery.
the study was approved by the ethics committee at the
bundesgesundheitsamt, berlin. written informed consent was
obtained from each subject.

study design
the study was performed as a randomised, double blind, placebocontrolled, four period cross over study. on four days, separated
at least by 1 week, subjects received either placebo ( nacl 0.9 %)
or  xxxd2098xxx  (partusistenr ampoules, containing  xxxd2098xxx  0.05
mg/ml) by intravenous infusion at 0.5,1.0 and 2.0 µg/min over 3 h.
before drug administration, each subject had an indwelling heparin
lock placed in a forearm vein for blood sampling and a separate
iv catheter inserted in the contralateral arm for the  xxxd2098xxx  infusion. blood sampling and measurements of heart rate were done
before, and 0.16, 0.33, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.17, 3.33, 4, and 4.5 h after
starting the infusion. blood was collected in heparinised tubes. one
aliquot was used for determination of plasma potassium and the
remaining blood was centrifuged and the plasma frozen at [20° c
for the subsequent determination of the drug.

determination of heart rate
heart rate was measured by counting the radial pulse over 1 min.

as published previously, the concentration time course of  xxxd2098xxx 
was best described by an open linear two compartment model [4].
the model was parameterised in terms of the central volume of distribution ( v), the volume of distribution at steady state ( vss), the
intercompartmental (distribution) clearance (q) and the elimination clearance (cl). the interindividual and interoccasion variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters were modeled as
described by karlsson and sheiner [9 ]:
v = h(1) * e(

g (1) + flag1 * g(3) + flag2 * g(4) + flag3 * g(5))

cl = h(2) + g(2) + flag1* g(6) + flag2 * g(7) + flag3 * g(8) (2)
vss = v + h(3)

(3)

q = h(4)

(4)

where h1, h2, h3 and h4 are the population means of v, cl, vss–v
and q, respectively, and all g’s vary randomly between individuals
with mean zero and diagonal variance-covariance matrix omega2.
flag1, flag2, flag3 are equal to one for treatments 1, 2, 3,
respectively, and are otherwise zero. the variances of g(3)–(5) were
set to be equal, as well as the variances of g(6)–(8). in the above
model, g(1) describes the interindividual random variance of v (and,
indirectly, vss ), while g(3)–(5) describe an additional occasion specific
variation of v (and vss). the variance of g(2) is the interindividual
variance of cl, and the variance of g(4)–(6) is the interoccasion variance of cl. since only 7 subjects and 3 applications were examined, the data supported only interindividual and interoccasion
variability estimates for two of the structural parameters.
as the measured concentrations differed by at least one order
of magnitude, a multiplicative error model was chosen for modeling residual variability.
cobs = cexp * (1+e)

plasma potassium was measured by flame photometry ( klina
flame, beckman, munich, frg).

 xxxd2098xxx  assay

quantitative determination of  xxxd2098xxx  was performed by a sensitive radioimmunoassay after separation of its metabolites by extraction with tertiary butylmethylether, as previously described [8].
concentrations could be measured within the range 10 to
1000 pg·ml[1 (3.63 × 10[11 to 3.63 × 10[9 mol·l[1) with an
interassay coefficient of variation of 2.5% to 4.6%.

(5)

cobs refers to the observed concentration, cexp to the concentration predicted based on dose, time, q and the individual, occasion
specific parameters v, cl and vss. e is normally distributed with
mean zero and variance r2. a dependency of v and clearance on
the infusion rate was tested by using
v = h(1) * e(

cl = h(2) + g(2) + flag1 * g(6) + flag2 * g(7) + flag3 * g(8)
+ h(5) * rate

pharmacodynamic model
a) heart rate since hysteresis was not observed when plotting heart
rate against the plasma concentration of  xxxd2098xxx , the positive
chronotropic effect of  xxxd2098xxx  was modeled as a function of the
drug concentration in the central compartment. the following equation adequately described the data:
hr(t) = hrbase + s * cp(t)

(8)

155
with

s = h(4)

hr(t) = heart rate at time t

the model for the residual error was additive:

hrbase = basal heart rate

kobs = kexp + e

s = slope factor

kobs refers to the observed potassium concentrations, kexp to the
potassium concentrations predicted from cp(t), s, ktol and empirical bayes estimates of k0 and kout. e refers to a random variable
with mean zero and variance r2.

cp(t) = plasma concentration of  xxxd2098xxx  at time t
the plasma concentration of  xxxd2098xxx , cp(t), was calculated from
dose, time and the empirical bayesian estimates of the individual,
occasion specific pharmacokinetic parameters.
additive interindividual and interoccasion variability models
were chosen for hrbase and for s (interindividual variability only):
hrbase = h(1) + g(1) + flag1 * g(3) + flag2* g(4)
+ flag3 * g(5)
s = h(2) + g(2)

(9)
(10)

where all g were normally distributed with mean zero and diagonal variance-covariance matrix x2, and the variances of g(3)–(5) were
equal. adding interoccasion variability for s did not significantly
improve the fit.
because the observed heart rates fell within a relatively narrow
range, an additive error model was used for residual variability.
hrobs = hrexp + e

(11)

hrobs refers to the observed heart rates, hrexp to the expected
heart rates based on cp(t), as predicted by the pharmacokinetic
model and empirical bayesian estimates of hrbase, and s. e is normally distributed with mean zero and variance r2.
b) potassium since  xxxd2098xxx  induces hypokalemia by enhancing
the transfer of potassium into the intracellular space, the change in
the plasma potassium concentration over time was described by a
modified physiological indirect response model with feedback inhibition according to the following equations [10,11,12].
dk/dt = kin * f(t)[kout * (1 + s * cp(t)) * k(t)

(12)

df/dt = (k0 /k(t)[f(t)) * ktol

(13)

k0 baseline plasma potassium concentration [mmol· l[1]
k(t) plasma potassium concentration at time t [mmol · l[1]
kout transfer constant out of the extracellular into the intracellular
space [h[1]
f(t) feedback factor counterregulating against changes of the
plasma potassium concentration by adjusting the input into
the extracellular space
s slope factor linking the increase of cp and the efflux of potassium from the extracellular space [ (ng· l[1) [1]
cp plasma concentration of  xxxd2098xxx  [ng·l[1]
kin transfer constant into the extracellular space [(mmol · l [1) · h[1]
ktol decay constant of the feedback process increasing the influx of
potassium into the extracellular space [h[1]
initial conditions: k(t) = k0; f = 1. at time zero dk /dt =
kin[kout * k0 = 0; therefore kin = k0 * kout. substitution in eq. (12)
yields:
dk/dt = kout * k0 * f(t)[kout * (1+ s * cp(t)) * k(t)

(14)

the plasma concentration of  xxxd2098xxx , cp(t) was calculated from
dose, time and the empirical bayesian estimates of the individual
pharmacokinetic parameters. both interindividual and interoccasion variability were assumed for k0 and kout.
k0 = h(1) + g(1) + flag1 * g(3) + flag2 * g(4) + flag3 * g(5)
(15)
g(2) + flag1 * g(6) + flag2 * g(7)+flag3 * g(8))

kout = h(2) * e(

ktol = h(3)

simulations
sequential pk/ pd simulations of the positive chronotropic and the
potassium lowering effects of  xxxd2098xxx  were performed for a population of 100 subjects receiving an iv infusion of 2 µg · min[1, the
highest infusion rate examined. first, 100 sets of individual, occasion specific pharmacokinetic parameters were simulated, based on
the estimated population means and interindividual and interoccasion variances of the pharmacokinetic parameters. these sets of
parameters were subsequently used in simulation of 100 effect time
courses for heart rate and plasma potassium concentration based
on the estimated population means, interindividual and interoccasion variances of the pharmacodynamic parameters, and the estimated residual variances of heart rate and plasma potassium
concentration.
the program system nonmem version iv with the fo
method was used for all model fitting, empirical bayesian estimation of individual and occasion specific parameters and simulations.
the parameters describing interindividual and interoccasion variance were added one at a time and were kept in the model if they
improved the goodness of the fit, judged by the likelihood ratio criterion with p < 0.05 [13].

results
with the exception of one subject, who dropped out
after the infusion at 1.0 µg ·min[1 on the first day, all
volunteers completed the study. tremor and restlessness were reported by several volunteers, especially
when receiving the drug at the highest infusion rate.
although the plasma potassium concentration dropped
well below 3 mmol ·l [1 at the highest infusion rate,
none of the volunteers showed clinical symptoms of
hypokalaemia.
pharmacokinetic analysis
as published previously, the plasma concentration-time
course was best described by a two compartment model
[4 ]. the measured plasma concentrations in all subjects and infusion rates, as well as the model predictions based on the population means, are shown in
fig. 1. the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters are summarised in table 1. due to the small
number of individuals it was not possible to estimate
the interindividual and interoccasion variance of all
parameters.
the mean volume of distribution of the central compartment was 13.8 l, close to the extracellular fluid
space. 68 % of the individuals were expected to have

central volumes of distribution ranging from 6.9–27.7

introducing the infusion rate as a covariate into the
equation describing the individual elimination clearance (7), significantly improved the fit (p < 0.01). the
mean clearance was 1.27 l· min[1 at 0.5 µg · min[1,
1.45 l·min[1 at 1 µg ·min[1, and 1.81 l· min[1 at
2 µg·min[1. the estimated interindividual coefficient
of variation of the clearance was 11.8 %, about the same
as the interoccasion variability (15.6 % ).

pharmacodynamic analysis.
both heart rate and plasma potassium concentration
were stable under placebo treatment, indicating that
the study was performed under well-controlled conditions. the time course of the heart rate during and after
iv infusion of  xxxd2098xxx  was fitted to a linear concentration-effect model with baseline. employing an emax
model did not significantly improve the fit. the

population means, are shown in fig. 2. the corresponding pharmacodynamic parameters are summarised in table 2. the mean heart rate in the absence
of the drug was estimated to be 78 beats ·min[1, with
very small interindividual and interoccasion variability
(cv’s of 7% and 5 %, respectively).  xxxd2098xxx , in the
observed concentration range, caused a linear, dosedependent increase in heart rate (population mean:
0.032 beats·min[1·ng[1·l interindividual variability:
22.7%). the residual standard deviation was 6.3
beats·min[1.
the time course of the plasma potassium concentration during and iv  xxxd2098xxx  was modeled with the
physiologic indirect response model. inclusion of a
feedback model enhancing the backflow of potassium
from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment
significantly improved the fit (p < 0.001). this
approach adequately described the hysteresis and
yielded an adequate fit over the entire dose range. the
measured plasma potassium concentrations for all subjects and infusion rates and the model predictions based

on the population means are given in fig. 3. as can
be seen, the nadir of the potassium concentration
occured sooner as the infusion rate rose. the corresponding pharmacodynamic parameters are summarised in table 3. the initial plasma concentration
of potassium was 3.93 ( 0.098 ) ( 0.146 ) mmol·l[1
(population mean ( interindividual sd) and (interoccasion sd). the population mean of the slope factor
was 6.22 * 10[4 (ng · l )[1. introducing interindividual
or interoccasion variability did not significantly
improve the fit. kout is estimated to be 0.397 h[1, and
the typical individual and occasion specific deviations
from the mean ( e√omega2 ) were 1.67 and 2.02 for interindividual and interoccasion variability, respectively. the
large interoccasion variability was mainly due to one
subject, who showed an early and pronounced rise
in plasma potassium when receiving the lowest infusion rate ( fig. 3 ). the residual standard deviation was
0.2 mmol ·l[1.

simulations1
simulation of the time course of the heart rate and the
potassium plasma concentration was performed for 100
hypothetical subjects receiving a continous infusion of

 xxxd2098xxx  at the highest rate examined (2 µg·min[1 );
(fig. 4 and 5 ). the median heart rate at steady state
was 113 beats ·min[1 and the 5 – 95 % quantile range
was 89–137 beats · min[1. the lowest median plasma
concentration of potassium was 2.77 mmol·l[1
(5 – 95 % quantile 2.24 –3.37 mmol ·l[1 ), which was
reached 1.5 h, well before steady state. thereafter, the
model predicted a slow rise in plasma potassium
towards normal.

pk/pd studies in the population of interest are the
most useful means to evaluate the relationship between
concentration and effect, whether therapeutic or
adverse. the majority of publications about  xxxd2098xxx 
have focused on airway resistance and tachycardia in
asthmatic patients after inhalation of  xxxd2098xxx , often
describing mere dose-effect relationships [14]. a
pk /pd analysis of the chronotropic and bronchodilation effects of  xxxd2098xxx  after inhalation and systemic
application has been performed in asthmatic patients
[ 3 ].
as  xxxd2098xxx  is also used for tocolysis, another population of interest consists of women aged between 20
and 40 years. since pregnancy does not alter the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2098xxx  [5 ] and is very unlikely to
alter its pharmacodynamics, we believe that our results
are relevant to therapeutic use of the drug. only one
publication adresses the concentration-response relationship of  xxxd2098xxx -induced tachycardia in pregnant
women [ 15 ]. although frequently observed in the clinical setting, hypokalaemia, has not so far been adequately characterised.
the population examined (7 healthy females) was
homogenous with respect to age and weight and the
individuals did not receive any comedication. there
were also sufficient data from each subject to fit an
individual pk / pd model. thus, a population analysis
might seem unnecessarily complicated, as opposed to
a more traditional method of data analysis, like the
standard two stage ( sts ) method. the population
approach was preferred, however, because it permitted
estimation of interindividual and interoccasion variance, whilst avoiding overestimating these variances,
as the sts method typically does [ 16 ]. on the other
hand, it is not possible to obtain estimates of interindividual and interoccasion variance of all parameters
with data from 7 subjects and 3 applications. we have
estimated those interindividual and interoccasion variances that had the greatest impact on the objective
function.
sequential pk /pd analysis was preferred to simultaneous analysis to avoid distortion of the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates by the effect data. the two
pd data sets were also fitted independently of each
other. as reported previously, the pharmacokinetics of

159

the drug are best described by a linear two compartment model. we also confirmed the influence of the
infusion rate on the elimination clearance [ 4 ]. since
 xxxd2098xxx  is a low protein bound, high extraction drug,
which is exclusively cleared by the liver, its clearance
should correlate directly with hepatic blood flow. it is
well known that b2-adrenoceptor agonists increase cardiac output by their chronotropic and inotropic action
and also by decreasing afterload. therefore, the
increased clearance of  xxxd2098xxx  at higher doses / infusion rates could well have been due to its effect
on hepatic blood flow. the clearance values between
1.3 and 1.8 l·min[1 are well in line with this hypothesis. since  xxxd2098xxx  almost immediately elicits its
positive chronotrope effect and, due to the design of
the study (the first concentration measurement was
obtained 10 min after beginning the  xxxd2098xxx  infusion), the predicted plasma concentration could
be used as the input in the pharmacodynamic model.
the concentration-effect relationship for positive
chronotropy remained stable throughout the observation period, precluding early desensitisation to the
positive chronotropic effect of the drug. this is in line
with earlier observations of the time course of
 xxxd2098xxx -induced tachycardia. the rapid desensitisation mechanisms reported for events at the receptor
and postreceptor levels after exposure to the nonselective b-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2401xxx  [ 17, 18, 19,
20] are not directly related to the time course of desensitisation of tachycardia during therapy with b2-adrenoceptor agonists. however, after 3 days of tocolytic
therapy with  xxxd2098xxx  sustained release tablets
(3 × 14 mg per day), the initial rise heart rate had been
succeeded by a return to baseline [ 6 ]. the potassium
lowering effect of systemically applied b2-adrenoceptor
agonists is well known [ 21, 22 ]. the concentration
time course of terbutaline-induced hypokalaemia has
already been examined by pk / pd modeling. the pharmacodynamics was adequately described by a negative
sigmoid emax model with baseline. the hysteresis loop
between the concentration-time courses of terbutaline
and potassium in plasma was collapsed by using the
effect compartment approach [23 ].
recently, pharmacodynamic models which account
for the underlying physiology of b2-adrenoceptor
agonist induced hypokalaemia, the so called indirect
physiological response models, have been described
[10,11]. as previously reported, the potassium lowering effect of b2-adrenoceptor agonists does not involve
renal elimination of potassium [ 24 ]. instead, they activate na+/k+ atpase via a camp-dependent mechanism [25], leading to a shift of potassium from the
extracellular into the intracellular space. the physiological response model addresses this process by explicitly predicting a concentration-dependent increase
in the transport rate for potassium out of the extracellular space in the presence of  xxxd2098xxx . thus, the
hysteresis between the time courses of the concentrations of  xxxd2098xxx  and potassium in plasma can

be explained by a known physiological mechanism
rather than by introducing a hypothetical effect compartment.
in studies of patients on long term oral  xxxd2098xxx 
therapy, the potassium lowering effect of the agent
appears to be self terminating within 24 h (hildebrand,
personal communication). therefore we tested whether
introduction of a feedback mechanism in the pd model
improved its fit. the model employed was suggested by
holford as a description of the development of tolerance to cocaine [12]. it assumes the synthesis of a putative substance, which stimulates a physiological process
counteracting the process enhanced by the drug in
question, rather than directly attenuating the drug
effect. in our case, the substance is assumed to stimulate the flux of potassium from the intracellular to the
extracellular fluid space. the introduction of the feedback model greatly improved the fit (p < 0.001),
suggesting that tolerance to the hypokalaemic effect
of  xxxd2098xxx  develops even during the first hours of
treatment.
in order to obtain a clinically useful representation
of the variability and extent of  xxxd2098xxx -induced tachycardia and hypokalaemia in women receiving an infusion at a rate sufficient for tocolysis, we performed
simulations at the highest infusion rate examined
(2µg ·min[1, n = 100). from the simulations, it
becomes clear that after 4 h of therapy 90% of the
patients would show heart rates between 89 and 137
beats ·min[1. one and a half hours after the start of
the infusion, the nadir of the plasma potassium concentration would be reached; 90 % of the patients would
show a plasma potassium concentration between 2.24
and 3.37 mmol· l[1, which would slowly return
towards normal despite continued administration of
the drug. this early physiological counterregulation
may be the reason why symptomatic hypokalaemia is
virtually unknown as an adverse effect of tocolysis with
b2-adrenoceptor agonists.
