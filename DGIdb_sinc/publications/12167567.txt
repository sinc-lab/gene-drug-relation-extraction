abstract:
at the sulfonamide moiety to form m2. further oxidation of m1 led to
the formation of several other phase i metabolites. oxidative breakdown of the n-hydroxy sulfonamide function group in m2 led to the
formation of corresponding sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid metabolites. the o-glucuronide conjugate of m1 and n-glucuronide conjugate of  xxxd3481xxx  were the major urinary metabolites, which
accounted for 23.3 and 19.5% of the total administered dose,
respectively. the remaining urinary metabolites were glucuronide
conjugates of other phase i metabolites. only 3% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent, suggesting that renal clearance is insignificant for  xxxd3481xxx . absorption
of  xxxd3481xxx  was excellent since the recovery of unchanged
 xxxd3481xxx  in feces was <1% of the administered dose.

the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, is responsible for the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandin h2, a key step in the generation of
proinflammatory eicosanoid mediators (vane et al., 1994; vane and
botting, 2000). now it is well known that cyclooxygenase is present in
two forms; one form is constitutive (cox-11) and is widely expressed in
nearly all tissues throughout the body, whereas the other form is inducible
(cox-2) and is predominantly expressed in inflamed tissues (needleman
and isakson, 1997; golden and abramson, 1999). therefore, selective
inhibition of cox-2 should maintain the anti-inflammatory effects while
reducing adverse effects (gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet effect) of
traditional nonsteroidal agents due to their nonselective inhibition of
cox-1 (masferrer et al., 1990, 1994; seibert et al., 1999).
celecoxib (fig. 1) is the first selective cox-2 inhibitor developed
in the united states and is widely available as a prescription drug in
the united states and europe, as well as in other countries (goldenberg, 1999; clemett and goa, 2000; goldstein et al., 2000; leese et
al., 2000; megeff and strayer, 2000; steinbach et al., 2000).
 xxxd3481xxx  (fig. 1), a diarylsubstituted isoxazole, is chemically

distinct from celecoxib. compared with celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx  possesses even greater potency and high specificity for cox-2 inhibition.
as a novel cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd3481xxx  demonstrated analgesic,
anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties in pharmacological studies in animals (talley et al., 2000).  xxxd3481xxx  (bextra) has
approved by us food and drug administration for the relief of signs
and symptoms of osteoarthritis and adult rheumatoid arthritis and for
the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.
the purpose of this study was to determine the disposition of
[14c] xxxd3481xxx  after a single oral dose of 50-mg [14c] xxxd3481xxx  to
human subjects. the selection of a 50-mg dose was to cover the
anticipated clinic dose of 40 mg for the acute pain management
indication.

 xxxd3481xxx  is a potent and specific inhibitor of  xxxg1884xxx ,
which is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,
and the dysmenorrhea pain. eight male human subjects each received a single 50-mg oral dose of [14c] xxxd3481xxx . urine, feces, and
blood samples were collected after administration of the radioactive
dose. most of the radioactivity in plasma was associated with  xxxd3481xxx  and the hydroxylated metabolite of  xxxd3481xxx  (m1). the estimated terminal half-life for  xxxd3481xxx  was about 7 h. about 76.1% of
the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 18% of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces.  xxxd3481xxx  was extensively metabolized in human, and nine phase i metabolites were identified. the
primary oxidative metabolic pathways of  xxxd3481xxx  involved hydroxylation at either the methyl group to form m1 or n-hydroxylation

postdose. all individual urine samples collected from the study were refrigerated. at the end of each collection interval, the total urine volume collected
was measured and recorded.
individual fecal samples and fecal wipes were collected beginning 12 h
predose and at 24 h intervals through 8:00 am on day 10 postdose. the
collection date, time, and weight of the sample were recorded. samples were
frozen immediately. all samples were stored at ⫺20°c before analysis.
plasma profiling. plasma samples were extracted with acetonitrile/water
(90:10). the ratio of plasma to the solvent was 1:4 (v/v) for the first extraction;
the precipitate was extracted with 2 ml of solvent three more times. the 16-h
plasma samples were pooled from all 8 subjects due to low individual radioactivity concentrations at that time. the extracts were combined and evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at room temperature to near dryness.
the residue was then reconstituted in the initial hplc mobile phase for
hplrc profiling using method a. the extraction efficiencies of radioactivity
from plasma samples (up to 12 h postdose samples) ranged between 104 and
112%, which was similar to the extraction efficiency obtained from the
[14c] xxxd3481xxx -spiked standard plasma samples (109 ⫾ 3%). for plasma
samples collected at 16 h postdose, the corresponding extraction efficiency was
93.6 ⫾ 2.7%. concentrations of  xxxd3481xxx  and m1 in plasma were calculated
based on their hplrc peak area ratios and the total radioactivity of plasma.
red blood cell profiling. the rbc samples were extracted using the same
extraction procedure as for plasma and profiled using method a. the extraction efficiencies of radioactivity from rbc samples collected at 1 and 4 h
postdose were 90.9 and 98.3%, respectively.

urine profiling. 0- to 24- and 24- to 48-h urine samples were loaded onto a
preconditioned c18 bond elut column (1 cc, 100 mg, varian sample preparation
products, harbor city, ca). preconditioned c18 bond elut columns (3 cc, 1 g)
were used to extract 110 ml of 48- to 96-h urine pooled from 8 subjects. the
loaded column was washed with one-half column volume of water and then eluted
with one column volume of methanol. the methanol eluates were dried under a
gentle stream of nitrogen at room temperature and then reconstituted in the initial
hplc mobile phase for hplrc profiling using method a. the mean percentage
of radioactivity recovered from the 0- to 24-h urine samples using the c18 bond
elut column extraction procedure was 96.6%.
incubation of urine with ␤-glucuronidase and base. the ␤-glucuronidase incubation sample was prepared by adding ⬃200 units of ␤-glucuronidase
(made from bovine liver, sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) to 1 ml of a mixture
of urine and 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer (ph 5.0; 1:1, v/v). the base
hydrolysis incubation sample was prepared by mixing urine with 0.2 m glycine
buffer (ph 10.0) (1:1, v/v). all incubation samples were covered with punctured parafilm and incubated at 37°c for 16 h. the incubated samples were
profiled by hplrc using method b.
fecal profiling. based on sample weight, fecal samples were mixed with 2to 3-fold excess of acetonitrile/water (80:20) followed by homogenization and
centrifugation. this process was repeated three times. the supernatants obtained in each step were combined and evaporated under a gentle stream of
nitrogen at room temperature. the dried samples were reconstituted in water
and loaded onto preconditioned c18 bond elut columns (3 cc, 1 g). the loaded
columns were washed with water (1 ml) and then eluted with methanol (3 ml).
the methanol eluates were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen at room
temperature and then reconstituted in the initial hplc mobile phase for
hplrc profiling using method a. the acetonitrile extraction recovery from
fecal homogenates was 38.1% based on the combustion analysis. in contrast,
the acetonitrile extraction recovery of spiked fecal homogenate with
[14c] xxxd3481xxx  and [14c]sc-66905 was complete. therefore, in estimating of
the percent dose recovered as  xxxd3481xxx  and m1 (sc-66905), the acetonitrile
extraction recovery was assumed as complete. based on these results, it was
judged that the remaining fecal radioactivity was not extractable with acetonitrile solution. further attempts to increase the extraction yield with alternative extraction solvents (methanol or acetone) yielded extracts that were
unsuitable for hplrc profiling, and therefore, acetonitrile extracts were used
for the final fecal profiling.
hplrc. the hplrc system consisted of a hewlett packard series 1050

mington, de) and flo–onea-500 radioactivity (perkinelmer life sciences,
boston, ma). the following hplc methods were used in the study.

method a. the hplc column was a novapak c18 column (3.9 ⫻
150 mm, 4 ␮m; waters corp, milford, ma). mobile phase a
consisted of acetonitrile, methanol, and 25 mm sodium acetate (ph
4.0) at a ratio of 1:2:27 (v/v/v). mobile phase b consisted of
acetonitrile, methanol, and 25 mm sodium acetate (ph 4.0) at a

ratio of 1:2:3 (v/v/v). the hplc gradient started at the initial
condition of 100% mobile phase a and progressed to 100% mobile
phase b over 25 min. the system was returned to initial conditions and
allowed to re-equilibrate for 15 min before the next run. the flow rate of
mobile phase was 1.0 ml/min. eluates from the hplc column were
mixed with flo-scint iii (perkinelmer life sciences) at a ratio of 1:3
(v/v) for radioactivity detection.

percent of dose excreted as each metabolite during 0 to 96 h postdose collection period is indicated.

method b. the hplc column was a novapak c18 column (3.9 ⫻
150 mm, 4 ␮m; waters corp.). mobile phase a consisted of acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium acetate (ph 4.0) at a ratio of 10:90
(v/v). mobile phase b consisted of acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium
acetate (ph 4.0) at a ratio of 50:50 (v/v). the hplc gradient started
at the initial condition of 100% mobile phase a and progressed to
100% mobile phase b over 20 min. the hplc was programmed back
to 100% mobile phase a over a 2-min period and re-equilibrated to
100% mobile phase a for 15 min before the next run. the flow rate
of mobile phase was 1.0 ml/min.
lc-ms/ms. lc-ms/ms analyses were carried out on a hewlett packard
1100 autosampler and hplc pump coupled to a quattro ii triple quadruple
mass spectrometer (micromass, altrincham, uk) using hplc method b.
approximately 20% of the eluate was diverted to the mass spectrometer via a
1:4 t-splitter, and the remaining eluate was mixed with flo-scint iii at a
ratio of 0.8:3 (v/v) for on-line radioactivity detection. the hplrc response
was recorded in real time by the mass spectrometer data system, which
provided simultaneous detection of radioactivity and ms data. the mass
spectral analysis was performed in negative ion electrospray ionization mode.
the capillary and cone voltages were set at 3.6 and 30 v. cid studies were
performed using collision energy of 26 ev and a collision cell of argon gas
with the pressure at 2 ⫻ 10⫺3 mbar.
nmr. a bruker amx-500 nmr instrument (bruker instruments, billerica, ma) equipped with a 5-mm broadband indirect detection probe was
used. the solvent used was deuterated methanol. urine metabolites (v-g,
m1-g, m2-g, and m3-g) were first fraction-collected from hplc and then
were dried for nmr analysis.
liquid scintillation counting. total radioactivity was measured with
liquid scintillation spectrometers (mark iii; tracor analytic, elk grove, il).

chemical quenching was corrected using the automatic external standard
channel ratio method.

results
total recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces. total recovery of the administered radioactive dose was 94.1% (fig. 2). most
of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine, which accounted for 76.1% of dose, the remainder being recovered in feces,
which accounted for18% of dose.
profiling of plasma. following oral dosing, radiolabeled material
was rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract into the systemic circulation, with a cmax value of 1.04 ␮g eq/ml observed in plasma at
1.7 h postdose (fig. 3). the hplrc plasma-profiling results are
shown in fig. 4. most of the radioactivity in plasma was associated
with  xxxd3481xxx  and the hydroxylated metabolite of  xxxd3481xxx  (later
designated as m1), and the remaining radioactivity was probably due
to other undetected radiolabeled metabolites. the structure of m1 is
shown in fig. 5. based on the hplrc profiling results and the total
radioactivity in plasma, the plasma concentration-time profiles of
 xxxd3481xxx  and m1 were constructed, and the results are shown in fig.
3. the estimated terminal half-life for  xxxd3481xxx  was about 7 h.
plasma concentrations of m1 were much lower than those of  xxxd3481xxx  at each sampling time.
profiling of red blood cells. the hplrc profiling of red blood
cells indicated that all radioactivity in red blood cells was associated
with  xxxd3481xxx  at 1 and 4 h postdose. the average ratios of rbc/
plasma concentrations of total radioactivity were 4.25 at 1 h and 3.46

at 4 h postdose, indicating radioactivity was more extensively partitioned into rbcs than plasma.
urine and fecal profiling. representative hplc profiles of urine
and fecal samples are shown in fig. 6. the mean percentages of dose
excreted as each metabolite are included in fig. 5. m1 was a minor
urinary metabolite but its o-glucuronide conjugate, m1-g, was the
major urinary metabolite, accounted for 23.3% of the administered
dose. the n-glucuronide conjugate of the parent compound,  xxxd3481xxx  (v-g), accounted for 19.5% of the administered dose. the other
urinary glucuronide conjugate metabolites were m2-g, m3-g,
m5-g, and m9-g. their chemical structures are shown in fig. 5.
small amounts of m4, m6, and m9 were found in the urine. m7, a
sulfinic acid metabolite formed by the oxidative breakdown of the
n-hydroxy sulfonamide group in m2, was detected in urine in a trace
amount. m8, a sulfonic acid metabolite formed by oxidation of m7,
was also detected in urine in a trace amount. all of the remaining
identified metabolites were present in urine in trace amounts only.
hplrc profiling of fecal extracts (fig. 6) showed the presence of
many small peaks. among these small peaks,  xxxd3481xxx , m1, and
m3 were identified by lc-ms/ms. the remaining peaks were not
identified. overall, less than 1% of the administered radioactive dose
was recovered as  xxxd3481xxx , m1, and m3 in fecal samples.
incubation of urine with ␤-glucuronidase and base. aliquots
of urine samples were incubated with ␤-glucuronidase or with basic
buffer to determine the presence of glucuronide- or sulfate-conjugated
metabolites (since the purchased bovine liver ␤-glucuronidase also
contained some arylsulfatase activity). ␤-glucuronidase incubation of
urine samples showed the conversion of m2-g, m5-g, m1-g, and
m3-g to m2, m5, m1, and m3, respectively (fig. 7), which suggests
that m2-g, m5-g, m1-g, and m3-g were o-glucuronide conjugates.

base incubation of urine showed the conversion of v-g to  xxxd3481xxx .
the fact that v-g could not be hydrolyzed by ␤-glucuronidase but
could be hydrolyzed by base suggests that v-g is an n-glucuronide
conjugate, which was confirmed by lc-ms/ms.
metabolite structure elucidation by ms and nmr.  xxxd3481xxx 
was detected in plasma, urine, and feces. the hplc retention time of
the  xxxd3481xxx  peak was the same as that of the authentic  xxxd3481xxx 
standard. a deprotonated molecular ion with an m/z value of 313 was
present in the negative ion mass spectrum of the samples isolated from
plasma, urine, and feces which was consistent with that of the  xxxd3481xxx  standard. the cid spectrum of m/z 313 generated a series of
product ions, which was the same as those from the  xxxd3481xxx 
standard. these results confirmed that the assignment of  xxxd3481xxx 
peak in the hplrc profile of plasma, urine, and feces was correct.
 xxxd3481xxx -n-glucuronide (v-g) was only found in urine samples.
the negative ion mass spectrum of v-g showed a deprotonated
molecular ion at m/z 489, 176 da higher than that of  xxxd3481xxx ,
indicating that v-g was a glucuronide conjugate of  xxxd3481xxx . the
cid spectrum of m/z 489 generated a series of product ions at m/z 355,
313, 298, 234, 175, and 113 (fig. 8). the product ions at m/z 313, 298,
and 234 were formed by sequential losses of 176 (dehydroglucuronic
acid), 15 (nh), and 64 (so2) daltons from m/z 489. these results
suggested that the glucuronide conjugation of  xxxd3481xxx  had occurred at the sulfonamide group. the product ion at m/z 355 was
formed by a loss of 134 da (choh-choh-ch-cooh-o from the
glucuronic acid moiety) from the deprotonated molecular ion. the
product ions at m/z 175 and 113 were generated from the subsequent
losses of 18 (h2o) and 62 (hoch2-ch2oh) daltons from glucuronic
acid. the structure of v-g was further elucidated by proton nmr
analysis (fig. 9). the proton chemical shift of the methyl group, 2.51

ppm, was very similar to the shift observed for the methyl group of
 xxxd3481xxx  (2.48 ppm), indicating no change at the methyl moiety.
the chemical shifts of the protons on the phenyl ring with the
sulfonamide moiety were slightly different from the corresponding
shifts observed for  xxxd3481xxx . the chemical shift of the protons ortho
to the sulfonamide was shifted downfield compared with that observed for  xxxd3481xxx . the signal of the protons meta to the sulfonamide group was shifted to higher field (0.06 ppm) due to the
attachment of glucuronic acid at the nitrogen. consistent with the
proposed structures of v-g and m2-g, the chemical shift of the c-1
glucuronide proton of v-g (4.52 ppm; doublet, j ⫽ 8.8 hz) is up field
of the chemical shift of the c-1 proton in the n-hydroxy glucuronide,
m2-g (4.80 ppm, doublet, j ⫽ 8.6 hz). the large three-bond couplings indicate that the c-1 protons in both v-g and m2-g have
axial-axial relationships with the c-2 protons, and thus both structures
have been assigned with the glucuronide groups attached in the
equatorial positions. based on the ms and nmr data, v-g was
identified as an n-glucuronide conjugate of  xxxd3481xxx .
m1 was found in plasma, urine and feces. the deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 329 and the cid spectrum of m1 matched those of
the synthetic standard. the cid spectrum of m/z 329 showed a major
product ion at m/z 196, which was formed by the loss of c8h7no via
a five-member ring rearrangement mechanism (fig. 8). based on
these data, m1 was identified as the 5-methyl hydroxylated metabolite
of  xxxd3481xxx .

m1-g was found in urine and could be converted to m1 upon
incubation with ␤-glucuronidase, suggesting it is a glucuronide conjugate. m1-g exhibited a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 505, 176
da higher than m1, confirming that m1-g was a glucuronide conjugate of m1. the cid spectrum of m/z 505 generated a series of
product ions at m/z 443, 329, 313, 299, 175, 113 and a base peak at
m/z of 196 da, which was similar to that of m1 (fig. 8). the
sequential losses of 176 (dehydroglucuronic acid), 16 (o), and 14
(ch2) daltons from the m/z 505 in the cid spectrum of m1-g
suggested that glucuronide conjugation of m1-g occurred at the
5-hydroxymethyl group of m1. detailed nmr analysis (fig. 9) confirmed the structural assignment of m1-g.
the cid spectrum of m2 (m/z 329) showed a product ion at m/z
298 and an intense product ion at m/z 234 (fig. 9), which matched
with the mass spectrum of a synthesized standard. based on its cid
spectrum as well as a detailed nmr analysis (fig. 10) of its glucuronide conjugate (m2-g), m2 was identified as an n-hydroxy sulfonamide metabolite of  xxxd3481xxx .
the n-hydroxy sulfonamide function group in m2 could undergo
oxidative breakdown to form the corresponding sulfinic and sulfonic
metabolites. the chemical mechanism of this reaction was reported
using n-hydroxybenzenesulfonamide as a model compound (grzesiok
et al., 1994; ruben et al., 1995). indeed, a small amount of m7, a
sulfinic acid metabolite, and m8, a sulfonic acid metabolite, were
detected in human urine.

m2-g was also found in urine and could be converted to m2
upon incubation with ␤-glucuronidase, suggesting it is a glucuronide conjugate. m2-g showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z
505, which was 176 da higher than that of m1, but it had a
different hplrc retention time than m1-g, suggesting that the
site of glucuronide conjugation was different between m2-g and
m1-g. the cid spectrum of m/z 505 generated a series of product
ions at m/z 329, 313, 298, 234, 175, and 113 (fig. 8) which were
also different from the product ions of m1-g. the subsequent
losses of 176 (dehydroglucuronic acid), 16 (o), 15 (nh), and 64
(so2) daltons from the m/z 505 ion in its cid spectrum suggested
that m2-g was a glucuronide conjugate of hydroxylated  xxxd3481xxx  with glucuronide conjugation occurring at the n-hydroxy
sulfonamide group of  xxxd3481xxx . the structure of m2-g was
further confirmed by nmr analysis (fig. 10). the proton chemical
shift of the methyl group, 2.51 ppm, was very similar to the shift
observed for the methyl group of  xxxd3481xxx  (2.48 ppm), indicating
that no changes occurred in the methyl group. the proton chemical
shifts of the 3-phenyl ring were also very similar to those observed

discussion
 xxxd3481xxx  and its hydroxylated metabolite, m1, were the main
radioactive components circulating in blood and in plasma. however,
as indicated in fig. 4, plasma concentrations of m1 were much lower
than the corresponding plasma concentrations of  xxxd3481xxx . given
the lower potency of m1 in a rat adjuvant arthritis model (talley et al.,
2000), it is expected that contributions of m1 to the overall efficacy
following oral administration of  xxxd3481xxx  would be relatively minor.
 xxxd3481xxx  was extensively metabolized. the phase i metabolic
pathway for  xxxd3481xxx  involved several oxidation reactions,
which were mainly mediated by the cyp3a4 isoform based on in
vitro experiments (e. burton, private communication). nine phase
i metabolites were found. three (m1, m2, and m9) were formed
by monohydroxylation of  xxxd3481xxx . two other phase i metabolites were formed by di-hydroxylation of  xxxd3481xxx  (m3 and m5).
two other metabolites, m4 and m6, were formed by further
oxidation of m1. the remaining two metabolites, m7 and m8,

for  xxxd3481xxx . the proton chemical shifts on the sulfonamide
phenyl ring were significantly different from the corresponding
shifts observed for  xxxd3481xxx . the chemical shift of the protons
ortho to the sulfonamide was downfield from the shift observed for
 xxxd3481xxx . the chemical shift of the protons meta to the sulfonamide group was shifted to lower field (0.03 ppm) due to the
glucuronide residue linked through oxygen. the assignment of the
structure of m2-g was consistent with the observation that the
chemical shift of the c-1 proton of the glucuronic acid group was
further down field (4.8 ppm) when the glucuronide residue was
attached through the oxygen atom of the n-hydroxy sulfonamide
moiety. based on the ms and nmr data, the structure of m2-g
was identified as a glucuronide conjugate of the n-hydroxy metabolite of  xxxd3481xxx .
similar detailed chemical structure analyses were performed for
m3, m3-g, m4, m5, m5-g, m6, m7, m8, m9, and m9-g. selected
cid spectra data obtained from these metabolites are shown in table
1. the nmr spectrum of m3-g is shown in fig. 10. the cid ms
spectra and nmr spectrum were consistent with the structure assignment for these metabolites shown in fig. 5.
 xxxd3481xxx  metabolic pathway. the metabolic pathways of
 xxxd3481xxx  in human are summarized in fig. 5. the phase i metabolism of  xxxd3481xxx  in human involved hydroxylation at the 5-methyl
group to form m1, hydroxylation at the meta position of the 3-phenyl
group to form m9 or n-hydroxylation at the sulfonamide function
group to form m2. the further oxidation of m1 led to the formation
of m4, a carboxylic acid metabolite and m6, an isoxazole ring opened
metabolite. m1 or m9 could be further hydroxylated to form the same
di-hydroxylated metabolite, m3, in which hydroxylation occurred at
both the meta position of the 3-phenyl group and the 5-methyl group
of  xxxd3481xxx . hydroxylation either at the 5-methyl group of m2 or at
the sulfonamide function group of m1 led to the formation of the
same metabolite, m5. the oxidative breakdown of the n-hydroxy
sulfonamide group in m2 led to the formation of the sulfinic acid
metabolite, m7, which was further oxidized to m8, a sulfonic acid
metabolite.
phase ii metabolism is the major elimination pathway for  xxxd3481xxx , since glucuronide conjugates accounted for ⬃80% of the
radioactivity recovered in urine. o-glucuronide conjugation occurred
at the hydroxyl group, which led to the formation of m1-g, m2-g,
m3-g, m5-g, and m9-g. n-glucuronide conjugation at the sulfonamide function group led to the formation of the n-glucuronide of
 xxxd3481xxx  (v-g).

were formed from oxidative breakdown of the n-hydroxy sulfonamide group in m2.
conjugation pathways played an important role in the elimination
of  xxxd3481xxx  in human. only a small percentage of the dose was
recovered in urine as unchanged  xxxd3481xxx  or as nonconjugated
phase i metabolites. the glucuronide conjugates of  xxxd3481xxx  and its
hydroxylated metabolites were the major urinary metabolites of  xxxd3481xxx . the o-glucuronide of m1 and n-glucuronide of  xxxd3481xxx 

accounted for 23.3 and 19.5% of the administered dose, respectively.
the n-glucuronide pathway is often species dependent (lee, 1998),
which is also true for  xxxd3481xxx  (n-glucuronide of  xxxd3481xxx  was
found in the monkey but absent in the rat and the dog).
less than 1% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered as
unchanged  xxxd3481xxx  in feces, suggesting that the absorption of
 xxxd3481xxx  from the suspension formulation was excellent. this was
later confirmed in a separate study, in which the absolute bioavail-
