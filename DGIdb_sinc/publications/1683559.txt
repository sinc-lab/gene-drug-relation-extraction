1  xxxd3145xxx , sk&f 101468 has been characterized preclinically as a specific dopamine
d2-receptor agonist. nine male healthy subjects were investigated for the effects on
supine and erect heart rate and blood pressure, catecholamines and prolactin, of a
single dose of 800 ,ug  xxxd3145xxx  preceded by a single dose of 20 mg  xxxd1927xxx 
or  xxxd1927xxx -placebo, and those of a single dose of  xxxd1927xxx  followed by
 xxxd3145xxx -placebo.
2 single doses of 800 ,ug  xxxd3145xxx  did not cause clinically significant changes in supine
resting heart rate and blood pressure. however, they caused postural faintness on 3
min immobile upright standing on 10/26 occasions.
3 pretreatment with 20 mg  xxxd1927xxx  1 h before administration of  xxxd3145xxx 
prevented the postural symptoms in all but one subject. it did not alter  xxxd3145xxx 's

plasma pharmacokinetics.
4  xxxd3145xxx  did not alter supine or standing catecholamine concentrations.
5  xxxd1927xxx  increased the plasma concentrations of prolactin whereas  xxxd3145xxx 
administered alone reduced them. a single dose of 800,ug  xxxd3145xxx  did not attenuate
the prolactin increase induced by a single dose of 20 mg  xxxd1927xxx  administered
1 h earlier.

introduction

methods

 xxxd3145xxx , sk&f 101468, (4-[2-dipropylamino)ethyl]1,3-dihydro-2h-indol-2-one, monochloride), is a novel
non-phenolic indolone derivative which acts as a
dopamine d2-receptor agonist (gallagher et al., 1985).
previous studies in healthy subjects showed that single
doses of  xxxd3145xxx  could cause nausea, orthostatic
hypotension and prolactin inhibition (acton & broom,
1989; de mey et al., 1990).
 xxxd1927xxx  is a well established dopamine d2receptor antagonist practically devoid of central effects
(heykants et al., 1981; kohli et al., 1983; laduron &
leysen, 1979; niemegeers et al., 1980).
the present study was conducted to evaluate the
clinical, pharmacokinetic and neuro-endocrine interaction between single doses of  xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd3145xxx , in order to assess 1) whether the observed adverse
events on acute dosing of  xxxd3145xxx  in normal man
relate to peripheral d2-receptor agonism, and 2) whether
pretreatment with  xxxd1927xxx  could prevent such undesired effects that occurred with acute doses of 800 to
1000 p,g  xxxd3145xxx  in healthy volunteers.

subjects and ethics

prolactin

ten male subjects (22 to 33 years of age) who on the
basis of extensive investigation were judged to be healthy,
participated. one subject was withdrawn from the study
and the profilings were completed for the intended nine
subjects. the study was conducted in accordance with
the declaration of helsinki (venice amendment, 1983)
and the german drug law (amg). the subjects were
informed about the study in detail, inclusive of their
right to withdraw from the study at any time and on their
initiative, and their consent was recorded in writing and
in the presence of a witness. the protocol was approved
by an independent ethics committee.

occasion, an active dose of 20 mg  xxxd1927xxx , with
 xxxd3145xxx  placebo 1 h later (treatment dp). the three
treatments were profiled in a double-blind fashion.
the treatment sequences were randomly allocated in a

 xxxd3145xxx . blood for catecholamines was collected in
heparinized chilled tubes which had been spiked with
sodiummetabisulfite. concentrations of noradrenaline
and adrenaline in plasma were assayed by ion-exchange
high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection after a clean-up procedure which
included liquid/liquid extraction and re-extraction in
diluted acid (meineke et al., 1989). the limits of quantitation were 0.296 nmol 1-1 and 0.027 nmol 1-1 for noradrenaline (ne) and adrenaline (e), respectively.

data format and analysis

study procedures
on the day preceding each study day, the subjects
abstained from alcohol-, xanthine-, or tyramine- containing foods or beverages. they were fasted from 22.00 h
on the night prior to each profiling up to 8 h after dosing
of  xxxd3145xxx  or placebo. the investigations started at
about 07.30 h. the subjects were supine and resting for
1 h before the administration of  xxxd1927xxx  or placebo
(time t = 0 min). at 2 (t = 180 min), 4 (t = 300 min) and
6 h (t = 420 min) after dosing of  xxxd3145xxx  or its matched
placebo (t = 60), the subjects stood upright and immobile for 3 min after a first minute sitting on the side of
the bed with both feet hanging free. except for these
postural tests, the subjects remained recumbent and
resting up to 8 h after dosing. heart rate (hr) was
monitored throughout, and blood pressure was measured
every 10 min in the supine position, and every minute
during sitting and standing.

sampling and assays for  xxxd3145xxx , prolactin and
catecholamines
venous blood was sampled for assay of plasma  xxxd3145xxx ,
before dosing, and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300,
360, 480 and 600 min, and at 24 h after dosing. plasma
concentrations of  xxxd3145xxx  were assayed by a radioimmunoassay developed by sk&f. the antiserum used
was raised in sheep to a diazo-derivative of  xxxd3145xxx 
conjugated to bovine  xxxg124xxx  and diluted 1:2500.
the assay was shown to have a lower limit of quantification
of 0.31 nmol 1-1 (inter-assay cv < 11% accuracy
± 7%). specificity for  xxxd3145xxx  was determined in the
presence of a potential major metabolite in human
plasma with which no significant cross-reaction was
shown to occur at the concentrations studied.
venous blood was sampled for assay of plasma prolactin, before dosing with  xxxd1927xxx , at 30 min after
dosing with  xxxd1927xxx , at 60 mmn after dosing with
 xxxd1927xxx  (i.e. immediately prior to dosing with
 xxxd3145xxx ) and at 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 480 and
600 min, and 24 h after administration of  xxxd3145xxx . the
plasma concentrations of prolactin were assayed by
radioimmunoassay using a commerical kit (maia clone

the supine heart rate (hr) and blood pressure (sbp/
dbp) data were summarized for each consecutive hourly
time zone by the area under the time course of the
variables.
supine observations (circulatory variables, prolactin
and catecholamines) subsequent to dosing were transformed as changed from the pre-dosing observations.
responses to standing were calculated as the postural
change relative to the supine observations immediately
prior to sitting and standing. these data were then
assessed for subject, period and treatment related
variance according to a general linear model. the
residual variance was used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals around the estimated treatment
differences for [ps-dp], [ds-dp] and [ds-ps] (scheff6s
method for simultaneous evaluation of multiple comparisons, scheffe, 1953).

results

one of the 10 recruited subjects was withdrawn on his
second study day, before dosing of  xxxd3145xxx , because
of sinoatrial dysfunction with pauses up to 2 s, occurring
at 20-30 min after administration of 20 mg  xxxd1927xxx .
this event was considered not to be drug related.

supine heart rate and blood pressure
little difference was observed between the treatments
in terms of supine hr, spb, dbp and mbp. there was
a trend towards slightly higher mean supine hr-values
beyond the first hour after administration of  xxxd3145xxx ,
whether pre-treated with  xxxd1927xxx  (treatment ds)
or not (treatment ps). the effects relative to treatment
dp ( xxxd1927xxx  plus  xxxd3145xxx  placebo) were only
about +1 to +4 beats min-, and even when reaching
statistical significance for certain time zones, they were
hardly likely to be clinically relevant. for instance, for
the 4th hour after administration of  xxxd3145xxx  the mean
treatment difference [ds-dp] was estimated to be +4.5
beats min-1, 95% ci: 0.5 to 8.5 beats min- .

observations on immobile upright standing

supine and standing catecholamines

the clinical events on standing at 2, 4 and 6 h after
administration of  xxxd3145xxx  or placebo are summarized
in table 1. thus, orthostatic symptoms occurred on
10/26 occasions in 6/9 subjects after treatment ps
( xxxd3145xxx  preceded by  xxxd1927xxx  placebo). these
postural symptoms occurred after approximately 1 min
standing in 2/10 incidents, after 2 min in 3/10 and at the
end of 3 min standing in the remaining 5/10 incidents.
only one subject suffered 2 such events after administration of treatment ds ( xxxd3145xxx  preceded by 20 mg
 xxxd1927xxx ). in most cases faintness and a general
non-specific feeling of 'not being well' ('malaise') were
observed, with pallor, dizziness and sweatiness. often
the incidents were associated with yawning. in 9/11
incidents nausea was the main feature. frank (sbp < 95
mm hg or a drop of sbp > 20 mm hg relative to the
previous reading, or dbp < 50 mm hg), relative
or clinical hypotension (loss of ulnar pulsations) was
observed in 7/11 of all symptomatic incidents, in the
remaining 4, postural blood pressure responses appeared
normal. none of these incidents was associated or
followed by absolute or relative bradycardia. the reactions were essentially postural in nature and rapidly
reversed after resuming the supine position. there was
no indication of altered orthostatic heart rate and blood
pressure control in those who could sustain standing
uneventfully (this is exemplified in table 2 for mean
heart rate and blood pressure at t 180 min).

there was no indication that any of the treatments
altered the supine catecholamine concentrations in a
clinically relevant fashion. the treatment means and
contrasts for noradrenaline are shown in table 3. there
were furthermore no treatment effects with regard to
the catecholamine responses to standing, even in those
subjects who could not sustain standing (for those
subjects the sample was taken immediately at onset of
the symptoms).

plasma prolactin
the time course of the median plasma prolactin concentrations is detailed in figure 1. plasma prolactin was
clearly stimulated by  xxxd1927xxx . the largest effect
was seen at 2 h after administration of  xxxd1927xxx 
(treatment dp: a mean rise of 38 ng ml-' nih-fl).
plasma prolactin was reduced relative to baseline after
administration of  xxxd3145xxx . the largest effect was seen
at 3 h after dosing of  xxxd3145xxx  (treatment ps: a mean
drop of 3.6 ng ml-' nih-fl). administration of  xxxd3145xxx  1 h after administration of  xxxd1927xxx  tended to
blunt the response of prolactin to  xxxd1927xxx , but the
differences were small and not likely to be clinically
relevant (for instance, at 2 h after administration of
 xxxd1927xxx  the mean treatment difference [ds-dp]
was estimated to be -5 ng  xxxg1167xxx , 95 % ci: -15 to 3).

 xxxd3145xxx  is a novel dopaminergic agonist with a relatively high selectivity for dopamine d2-receptor sites.
the drug might therefore be devoid of adverse effects
related to dopaminergic dl-receptor agonism and
ox-adrenergic effects, often seen with less selective
dopaminomimetics.
 xxxd3145xxx  affects both central and peripheral
dopamine d2-receptor sites. the former effects are
determinant of the drug's potential therapeutic value in
parkinson's disease. the latter are responsible for the
inhibition of prolactin by  xxxd3145xxx  observed here and
reported previously (acton & broom, 1989; de mey et
al., 1990). indeed, modulation of prolactin release is
considered to be a 'peripheral' function because of its
anatomical substrate which is not sealed off by the

 xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd3145xxx  interaction
blood-brain barrier (clemens et al., 1974; lemberger &
crabtree, 1979; thorner & vance, 1989). this agrees
with the finding that  xxxd1927xxx  increases prolactin as
also seen here. the lack of evident effect of  xxxd3145xxx  on
the prolactin stimulation by  xxxd1927xxx  administered
1 h earlier does not permit conclusions to be drawn
regarding the relative affinity of  xxxd1927xxx  and
 xxxd3145xxx  for these receptors. further experiments with
different sequence and timing of the drugs would be
required to elucidate this.
nausea and emesis are frequently reported side effects
of dopaminomimetic drugs (ho & thorner, 1988; rinne
1988), also thought to be related to essentially peripheral
dopaminergic effects (caine & kebabian, 1987). these
effects are usually transient, can be prevented by prior
food ingestion and by commencing treatment with low
doses followed by gradual increments (ho & thorner,

1988).
acute doses of  xxxd3145xxx  were found to cause mild
nausea, but no vomiting, in supine healthy subjects
(acton & broom, 1989; de mey et al., 1990). in the
present study nausea was not observed in supine subjects
but nausea and malaise were the main features of the
orthostatic symptoms that occurred when  xxxd3145xxx  was
administered without pretreatment with  xxxd1927xxx .
blood pressure reduction, especially on standing, has
often been observed with dopaminomimetics. the reports on the effects of  xxxd1927xxx  vs these dopaminomimetic hypotensive reactions are equivocal (pollak et
al., 1981; quinn etal., 1981; rinne, 1983). in the present
study supine blood pressure was not affected by the
treatments. a small rise in supine heart rate was seen
which confirms our previous findings (acton & broom,
1989; de mey et al., 1990). symptomatic events were
observed on immobile upright standing. the reactions
were different from the variant responses sometimes
observed with postural stress in normotensives (de mey
& enterling, 1988), and none of the incidents was
associated with or followed by absolute or relative
bradycardia as had been previously the case (acton &
broom, 1989). therefore, these postural events were
probably not vasovagal in nature. pretreatment with
 xxxd1927xxx  prevented the orthostatic reactions in all
but one subject. this indicates that the reactions are

487

most likely related to peripheral dopaminergic agonism.
the volunteer who was refractory to  xxxd1927xxx  pretreatment was studied in parallel to other subjects one of
whom suffered an orthostatic reaction. a psychological
witness effect might have occurred.
clinical experience in 22 parkinsonian patients pretreated with  xxxd1927xxx  showed that acute doses of
 xxxd3145xxx  up to 10 mg were well tolerated and did not
cause similar postural distress. chronic incremental
dosing with weekly dose increases up to 8 mg twice
daily did not produce significant orthostatic symptoms,
indicating the possible development of tolerance to
these events.
it is generally accepted that the hypotensive effects
of dopaminomimetics might relate to central and/or
peripheral pre-synaptic d2-dopaminergic effects resulting in a decreased neurogenic noradrenaline release
(clark et al., 1978; fuxe et al., 1974; kalsner & chan,
1980; kolloch et al., 1980; lokhandwala & jandyala,
1979; mohanty etal., 1985; sowers etal., 1982; whitfield
et al., 1985). we previously reported that single oral
doses of 400, 800 and 1000 jig  xxxd3145xxx  blunt the
noradrenaline responses to immobile erect standing at
200 min after dosing (de mey et al., 1990). in the present
study there was little treatment effect in terms of venous
plasma catecholamines, both in the supine resting position
and in response to standing. the noradrenaline responses
could not be judged deficient in symptomatic subjects.
however, this does not per se exclude inadequacy of the
postural neurogenic noradrenaline release, as peripheral
venous catecholamines are quite crude estimates of
sympathetic activity (folkow et al., 1983; goldstein et
al., 1983; hjemdahl, 1988; johnson et al., 1977).
we therefore conclude that single doses of 800 ,ug
 xxxd3145xxx  could cause faintness and malaise on 3 min
immobile erect standing in young healthy subjects. pretreatment with a single dose of 20 mg  xxxd1927xxx 
prevented these events in all but one subject. the
observed reactions are probably related to the peripheral
dopaminergic agonistic action of  xxxd3145xxx .
the authors wish to thank mrs h. degardin and mr s. walter
for their excellent technical support.
