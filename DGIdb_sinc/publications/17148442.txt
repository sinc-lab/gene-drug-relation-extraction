motif of ⬃40 amino acids, termed the socs box. structural and
functional analyses have shown that socs proteins mediate
their effects by direct interaction with activated janus kinases
and cytokine receptors via their n-terminal and sh2 domains
(2). recent in vivo evidence has revealed, however, that for a
complete termination of signal transduction, the socs box is
also required (3).
the socs box was first identified in the socs proteins and
has since been found in more than 50 proteins across a range of
species (4, 5). these proteins have been subdivided into nine
different families based on the type of domain or motif they
possess upstream of the socs box and include the eight socs
proteins, 18 asbs (ankyrin repeat-containing socs box proteins), four ssbs (spry-domain proteins with a socs box), and
two wsbs (wd40 repeat proteins with a socs box) (4, 5). the
socs box from several of these family members binds elongin
c, which in turn associates with a complex consisting of elongin b, a cullin family member (cullin-2 or cullin-5), and a
ring finger protein called  xxxg1960xxx  or rbx1 (5–7). this protein
complex constitutes an e3 ubiquitin ligase termed the ecs
(elongin c-cullin-socs box) that, together with a ubiquitinactivating enzyme (e1) and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
(e2), facilitates the polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of bound proteins, thereby regulating protein levels
within the cell (8, 9). other studies suggest an additional role for
the socs box, in particular that the socs box-elongin b/c
interaction may act to stabilize socs proteins, thereby protecting socs proteins from degradation (10 –12).
the asbs constitute the largest family of socs box-containing proteins, with 18 murine and human asbs identified, yet
their biological and biochemical functions are largely unknown.
the asbs contain a protein interaction motif upstream from
the socs box composed of a variable number of ankyrin
repeats. the ankyrin repeat consensus is 33 amino acids in
length and is found in eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral proteins
with various functions including receptors, cell cycle regulators, secreted proteins, tumor suppressors, and transcription
factors (13) (reviewed in ref. 14). each ankyrin repeat comprises a v-shaped helix-turn-helix motif, linked together by
loops. the repeats are stacked in bundles providing a stable
platform for protein-protein interactions (reviewed in ref. 15).

the suppressors of cytokine signaling (socs) proteins inhibit
cytokine action by direct interaction with janus kinases or activated cytokine receptors. in addition to the n-terminal and src
homology 2 domains that mediate these interactions, socs proteins contain a c-terminal socs box. dna data base searches
have identified a number of other protein families that possess a
socs box, of which the ankyrin repeat and socs box-containing (asb) proteins constitute the largest. although it is known
that the socs proteins are involved in the negative regulation of
cytokine signaling, the biological and biochemical functions of
the asbs are largely undefined. using a proteomics approach, we
demonstrate that  xxxg467xxx  ( xxxg467xxx ) interacts with asb-9
in a specific, socs box-independent manner. this interaction
increases the polyubiquitylation of  xxxg467xxx  and decreases total
 xxxg467xxx  levels within the cell. the targeting of  xxxg467xxx  for degradation
by asb-9 was primarily socs box-dependent and suggests that
asb-9 acts as a specific ubiquitin ligase regulating levels of this
evolutionarily conserved enzyme.

for  xxxg467xxx  in brain function is further supported by altered behavioral patterns observed in  xxxg467xxx  knock-out mice (28).
overexpression of  xxxg467xxx  has been observed in a number of
tumors, including neuroblastoma, small cell lung carcinoma,
colon and rectal adenocarcinoma, and breast and prostate carcinoma as well as some tumor cell lines (reviewed in refs. 27
and 29). elevated  xxxg467xxx  expression was also reported in b-lineage cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (30).
furthermore,  xxxg467xxx  is induced by the adenovirus e1a oncogene
(31). conversely, wild-type p53 repressed the  xxxg467xxx  promoter
(32). in fact, many human small cell lung carcinomas, which
exhibit elevated  xxxg467xxx  expression, contain mutations in p53 alleles (reviewed in ref. 27).
since socs box-containing proteins target specific proteins
for degradation via a socs box-dependent manner, we reasoned that the key to elucidating the function of the asb protein
family is to study the proteins with which they interact. here,
we report the identification of  xxxg467xxx  as a specific binding partner
of asb-9 with in vitro and in vivo confirmation of the interaction in primary cells. we show that the interaction leads to  xxxg467xxx 
ubiquitylation and degradation in a socs box-dependent manner, suggesting that asb-9 acts as a specific ubiquitin ligase
regulating  xxxg467xxx  abundance.

experimental procedures
northern hybridization—tissues were dissected from
8-week-old c57bl/6 mice and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. total rna was extracted from tissues using
trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(invitrogen). northern blots were performed after electrophoresis, as described (33). for northern blot hybridization,
the entire coding region of the mouse asb-9 cdna was used.
the membrane was stripped and rehybridized with a 1.2-kbp
psti fragment of the chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase cdna to control for rna loading and integrity.
expression of asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  in 293t cells—total cellular
rna was isolated using trizol reagent (invitrogen) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. first strand cdna synthesis was
performed using superscript iii rnase h⫺ reverse transcriptase (invitrogen). forward (f) and reverse (r) oligonucleotides specific for the sequence of human asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  were
designed as follows: asb-9, 5⬘-gagtcaggagcggacgtg-3⬘ (f) and 5⬘-cgtttgccttcagcattctt-3⬘ (r);
 xxxg467xxx , 5⬘-cggtatctggcacaatgaca-3⬘ (f) and 5⬘-gggtgaacacctccttcatgt-3⬘ (r). pcr conditions were as
follows: initial denaturation at 95 °c for 15 min, followed by 35
cycles of 95 °c for 15 s; 60 °c for 30 s; 72 °c for 30 s.
expression vectors for transient transfections—the cdnas
encoding asb-1 to asb-12, asb-14, asb-15, asb-17, socs-3,
and wsb-1 were obtained as described (2, 4, 34). constructs
encoding these proteins, with or without the socs box, with an
n-terminal flag epitope tag (dykddddk) were generated
by pcr to give fragments with in frame mlui restriction
enzyme sites at both the n and c termini and were subcloned
into the mammalian expression vector pef-flag-i.

the asbs have been implicated in different biological processes; asb-2 may regulate myeloid cell proliferation and/or
differentiation (16, 17), asb-5 plays a possible role in the initiation of arteriogenesis (18), and asb-11 may regulate the proliferation and differentiation of the developing nervous system
(19), whereas asb-15 has been reported to regulate muscle
growth by acting as a negative regulator of proliferating muscle
cells and by increasing the rate of protein synthesis in differentiated myoblasts (20, 21). asb-8 has been implicated in cancer,
with asb-8 expression undetectable in normal adult lung tissue
but present in several lung carcinoma cell lines. transfection of
a possible dominant negative form of asb-8 (human asb-8
cdna lacking the socs box) suppressed the growth of lung
adenocarcinoma cells in vitro, implying an association of asb-8
with the development of lung cancer (22). the function of asb-1
was studied by utilizing genetically modified mice. although
asb-1 knock-out mice displayed some testicular anomalies, it was
concluded that deletion and overexpression of asb-1 had no
obvious effect on mouse development, thus suggesting a possible redundancy between asb proteins (23).
recent studies propose that the asbs perform an analogous
role to the socs proteins, regulating various signaling pathways via an interaction between the socs box motif and the
elongin b/c complex to initiate ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of proteins bound to the ankyrin repeat region.
one study reported that asb-2 may target regulators of hematopoiesis for degradation by assembling into an ecs-type e3
ubiquitin ligase with the elongin b/c complex, cullin-5, and
rbx-1 (24). in a separate study,  xxxg2301xxx -mediated cellular
responses to tnf-␣ were negatively regulated by asb-3. downregulation of asb-3 by rna interference led to an accumulation of  xxxg2301xxx  and  xxxg2301xxx -associated cytotoxicity (25).
finally, asb-6 was found to interact with the adaptor protein
aps (adaptor protein with pleckstrin homology and sh2
domain), which couples the  xxxg1194xxx  to components of
a glucose transport pathway. following prolonged insulin stimulation, aps was degraded when asb-6 was overexpressed (26).
creatine kinase, an evolutionarily conserved enzyme, is critical for the maintenance and regulation of cellular energy stores
in tissues with high and rapidly changing energy demands, such
as skeletal and cardiac muscle and the brain. in mammals, three
cytosolic (ckm,  xxxg467xxx , and ckmb) and two mitochondrial
( xxxg469xxx  and  xxxg470xxx ) isoforms of creatine kinase are expressed.
ckm is muscle-specific, ckmb, a heterodimer of both muscle
and brain subunits, is predominantly expressed in heart, and
the two mitochondrial creatine kinase isoforms, ubiquitous
 xxxg469xxx  and sarcomeric  xxxg470xxx , are located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and are often co-expressed with the
cytoplasmic creatine kinases. the brain type cytosolic enzyme
of creatine kinase,  xxxg467xxx , plays a major role in cellular energy
metabolism of non-muscle cells.  xxxg467xxx  is expressed in a range of
tissues, mainly in the brain and retina, but also in the uterus,
placenta, kidney, and testes. there is ample evidence that the
ck system is linked with brain and muscle function (reviewed
in ref. 27). a number of neurological and muscular diseases
display perturbations in ck activity and creatine metabolism,
although the causal relationships of many are not known. a role

were cloned in with asci and mlui from pef-asb-9 and pefasb-9/⌬sb. all constructs were verified by sequencing
throughout the complete coding sequence.
generation of stable cell lines—stable cell lines were established by transiently transfecting the flp-intm t-rextm 293
cell line (invitrogen) with pcdna5 frt to constructs
(invitrogen) with the recommended amount of pog44. 24 h
after transfection, cells were split into 15-cm tissue culture
plates and selected with 500 ␮g/ml hygromycin (invitrogen) in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (invitrogen). after 1 week, individual colonies
were picked and then expanded and tested for doxycyclin (sigma)-regulated expression of the relevant construct, using protein separation on sds-polyacrylamide gels followed by western blot analysis.
cell lysis and affinity purification—cells were lysed in nonidet p-40 buffer (0.5% (v/v) nonidet p-40, 10 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.5), 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (complete mixture tablets; roche applied science) for 30 min on ice. for the ubiquitylation studies, cells
were treated with kalb lysis buffer (150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris

(tbs). bound gst-asb-9 was eluted in 10 1-ml fractions with
50 mm glutathione in 1% triton x-100 in tbs. fractions containing the gst fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed against pbs
overnight at 4 °c. murine asb-9 was also cloned into a pet15b
vector (novagen) and expressed as a his6-tagged protein in
bl21 de3 plyss e. coli (stratagene). the his-tagged asb-9
protein was expressed predominantly as an insoluble protein
and purified using ni2⫹- xxxd2739xxx  resin (giagen)
under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. fractions containing the his-tagged protein
eluted in 6 m guanidine hcl, 100 mm nah2po4, 10 mm trishcl, ph 4.5, were pooled and purified further by reversed phase
high pressure liquid chromatography on a 100 ⫻ 7.5-mm inner
diameter vydac c4 column with a 60-min linear gradient of
0 –100% acetonitrile in 0.085% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, lyophilized, and reconstituted in milli-q water.
balb/c mice were immunized with 30 ␮g of gst-asb-9 in
freund’s complete adjuvant and were then boosted with 30 ␮g
of gst-asb-9 in freund’s incomplete adjuvant. a final antigen
challenge with 30 ␮g of his-asb-9 in freund’s incomplete adjuvant was administered 3 days before spleens were removed.
spleen cells were fused with the sp2/o mouse myeloma cell
line. hybridomas, for which anti-asb-9 reactivity was detected,
were cloned by limiting dilution and supernatants from hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay for their ability to recognize both gst-asb-9 and hisasb-9. these supernatants were rescreened by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay to test for their ability to bind to protein
g in order to select for supernatants containing igg antibodies,
which are most suitable for their downstream applications,
namely immunoprecipitation and western blotting.
to purify anti-asb-9 antibodies, hybridoma supernatant was
passed though a protein g column (amersham biosciences),
and antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine buffer (ph 2.7). the
eluted antibody solution was neutralized with the addition of
tris, ph 8, to a final concentration of 0.1 m. to assess the purity
of the antibodies, ⬃0.5 ␮g of antibody was separated by sdspage under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. the
clone 5d3 was used to detect endogenous asb-9 where indicated in this study.

results
expression of asb-9 in vivo—in the adult mouse, asb-9
mrna expression was detected predominantly in the testes
and kidney, with low expression observed in the heart and liver
(fig. 1). asb-9 expression was undetectable in all other tissues
examined. since asb-9 mrna was normally expressed in the
kidney, we utilized the human embryonic kidney 293t cell line
to examine possible interactions of endogenous proteins with
asb-9 in addition to the standard overexpression studies.
identification of  xxxg467xxx  as an asb-9-specific interacting protein—
proteins that associate with asb-9 were purified from 293t
cells expressing flag-tagged asb-9 using anti-flag m2
affinity resin and resolved by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (fig. 2). various proteins were observed to co-immunoprecipitate with asb-9 that were absent in immunoprecipitates from control 293t cells (fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2).

generation of myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx  and detection of ubiquitylated protein—a cdna clone encoding  xxxg467xxx  in a
pcmv-sport6 vector was purchased from the i.m.a.g.e consortium (supplied by the medical research council geneservice)
(id 4225384). oligonucleotides 5⬘-acgtggcgcgccagcccttctccaacagccataatacg-3⬘ and 5⬘-acgtacgcgtctgggccggcatgaggtcatc-3⬘ were used to amplify the
 xxxg467xxx  coding sequence with in frame asci and mlui sites at the
5⬘ and 3⬘ ends. the pcr-generated fragment was digested with
asci and mlui and then subcloned into pef-myc-i to generate
a  xxxg467xxx  construct with a c-terminal myc (dqkliseedl) tag.
the myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx  plasmid, an ha-tagged ubiquitin plasmid, and a flag-tagged asb-9 plasmid or its deleted socs box
form were transfected into 293t cells as described above. clarified cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc
antibody, and ubiquitylated protein was detected by anti-ha
antibody (roche applied science).
pulse-chase analysis of  xxxg467xxx —293t cells were
transfected with the myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx  plasmid and either the
pefbos expression vector, flag-asb-9, or flag-asb-9/⌬sb
plasmids as described above. at 48 h post-transfection, cells
were rinsed with methionine-free dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (albumax i 10% solution; invitrogen). cells were radiolabeled for
1 h with 0.1 mci of [35s]methionine/cysteine mixture (neg072; perkinelmer life sciences) per ml of methionine-free culture medium. cells were then rinsed to remove pulse-labeling
medium and chased in normal culture medium. cell lysates
were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody as
described. protein was eluted with 40 ␮l of sds loading buffer,
separated by sds-page, and transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride-plus membranes. the 35s-labeled myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx 
protein was detected using a phosphorimager (molecular
dynamics) and quantified using imagequant software (version
5.0). the fraction of 35s-labeled myc- xxxg467xxx  remaining at each
time point was then calculated to allow the half-life of the protein to be estimated.
generation of anti-asb-9 monoclonal antibodies—for the
generation of anti-asb-9 monoclonal antibodies, balb/c mice
were immunized with  xxxg1073xxx  (gst)-tagged
asb-9 and his-tagged asb-9 recombinant proteins. to produce
gst-asb-9 protein, the cdna of murine asb-9 was subcloned
into a modified pgex-2t vector (amersham biosciences) as a
gst fusion protein. the gst-asb-9 was expressed in escherichia coli strain nm522 cells and purified according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. briefly,

with asb-9 in an apparently specific manner.
expression of asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  in 293t cells—the expression
of endogenous asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  in 293t cells at the mrna and
protein level was examined by reverse transcription-pcr and
western blot. asb-9 was expressed at low levels in 293t cells
and was detected by reverse transcription-pcr and by western

figure 1. northern blot hybridization analysis of asb-9 rna expression
levels. total rna was isolated from primary tissues taken from 8-week-old
normal mice. the transcript size for asb-9 is 1.3 kb. to confirm rna loading
and integrity, the blot was stripped and reprobed with glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ).

contrast,  xxxg467xxx  mrna and protein was abundant in
293t cells (fig. 3). as a consequence of the low basal expression
of asb-9, it was overexpressed for further analysis of the asb9- xxxg467xxx  interaction in 293t cells.
specificity of asb-9- xxxg467xxx  interaction—the specificity of the
asb-9- xxxg467xxx  interaction was further examined by testing the
interaction of  xxxg467xxx  with nearly all of the known asb proteins as
well as socs-3 and wsb-1. the flag-tagged asb proteins
were immunoprecipitated, and association with endogenous
 xxxg467xxx  was detected by western blot with anti- xxxg467xxx  antibody.
 xxxg467xxx  was only detected in immunoprecipitations from cells
transfected with asb-9 and none of the other asbs, suggesting
that the  xxxg467xxx  interaction was highly specific to asb-9 (fig. 4, a
and b). unsurprisingly, less related proteins, such as ssb-2,
wsb-2, and the ankyrin repeat proteins gankyrin and harp
(data not shown), did not interact with  xxxg467xxx .
socs box-dependent and -independent interactions—in
order to explore the basis of the asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  interaction,
full-length flag-asb-9 or asb-9 lacking the socs box (asb9/⌬sb) was transiently expressed in 293t cells, and the interaction with  xxxg467xxx  was examined. as shown in fig. 5a, both
asb-9 and asb-9/⌬sb readily interacted with endogenous
 xxxg467xxx , suggesting that the binding of the putative substrate  xxxg467xxx 
to asb-9 occurs independently of the socs box. as expected,
however, the socs box was critical for interactions with elongins b and c (fig. 5c) and cullin-5 (fig. 5d) (fig. 2) (6, 10).
asb-9 targets  xxxg467xxx  for degradation in a socs box-dependent manner—to examine the consequences of the interaction
between asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx , 293t cells were transfected with
increasing concentrations (0 –2.5 ␮g) of flag-tagged asb-9 or
flag-tagged asb-9/⌬sb constructs. total cell lysates were
analyzed by western blot with an anti- xxxg467xxx  antibody. as the
concentration of transfected asb-9 increased (fig. 6a, top left
panel), levels of endogenous  xxxg467xxx  decreased, suggesting that
asb-9 may play a role in regulating the levels of  xxxg467xxx  within the
cell. in contrast, the levels of endogenous  xxxg467xxx  were unaffected
in cells expressing asb-9/⌬sb (fig. 6a, top right panel), indicating that, whereas the binding of  xxxg467xxx  by asb-9 occurs via the
ankyrin repeats, the effect on  xxxg467xxx  protein levels is dependent
on an intact socs box. the consequence of asb-9 overexpression on endogenous  xxxg467xxx  levels was also examined in the hela
cell line. similar to the 293t experiments, overexpression of
asb-9 resulted in a socs box-dependent reduction in cellular
 xxxg467xxx  protein (fig. 6b).
a similar but more complete degradation was observed using
isogenic cell lines that stably and inducibly express asb-9 or
asb-9/⌬sb. upon induction of full-length asb-9 by doxycyclin,

an anti-flag western blot (wb) (b).

expression of all flag-tagged proteins was confirmed by reprobing with
anti-flag antibody as shown in c and d. /⌬sb represents socs box-deleted
constructs. wb, western blot.

no endogenous  xxxg467xxx  could be detected via western blot (fig.
6c). this was also observed in several independent cell lines
(data not shown). consistent with the transient transfection
results,  xxxg467xxx  levels remained unchanged when asb-9/⌬sb was
induced. the reduction of the  xxxg467xxx  protein was greater in the
stable lines compared with the transient expression system,
probably because all cells in the inducible stable cell lines
expressed the construct, whereas transient transfection could
only target a fraction of the total number of cells. a similar
complete degradation of a target protein by a ring finger containing e3 ligase has been previously observed using this inducible system (41).
by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, the localization of  xxxg467xxx  and various flag-tagged asb and socs proteins in 293t cells was examined (fig. 7).  xxxg467xxx  is expressed in
the cytoplasm of 293t cells and was easily visualized using an
anti- xxxg467xxx  antibody (fig. 7, top row). overexpressed flagtagged proteins were detected using an anti-flag antibody.
 xxxg467xxx  shared a cytoplasmic location with asb-9/⌬sb as well as
flag-tagged asb-3 and socs-3 proteins in 293t cells.
entirely consistent with results presented in fig. 6, endogenous

 xxxg467xxx  was undetectable in cells that expressed flag-asb-9 (fig.
7, second row), whereas levels and location of  xxxg467xxx  were unaffected by any of the other socs box-containing proteins tested
(fig. 7, rows 3–5). this highlights the reproducibility of this
interaction at the single cell level.
to assess further the effect of asb-9 on  xxxg467xxx  degradation, the
turnover of the  xxxg467xxx  protein was determined via pulse-chase
analysis. 293t cells were co-transfected with a myc-tagged
 xxxg467xxx  plasmid and either a pefbos vector control, flagtagged asb-9, or flag-tagged asb-9/⌬sb plasmids. transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35s]methionine and then
chased for various time periods in normal culture medium containing unlabeled methionine (fig. 8). myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx  was
immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody, and labeled
proteins were visualized using a phosphorimager. as before,
turnover of  xxxg467xxx  was accelerated by co-expression of asb-9,
and the socs box was required for this effect, since  xxxg467xxx 
half-life was similar in the presence or absence of asb-9/⌬sb
(fig. 8, a and b). finally, treatment with the proteasomal
inhibitor  xxxd357xxx  prolonged  xxxg467xxx  half-life (fig. 8b). these
results indicate that asb-9 promotes the degradation of  xxxg467xxx 
and that the degradation is socs box-dependent and is
mediated by the proteasome.
asb-9 induces socs box-dependent ubiquitylation of  xxxg467xxx —
socs proteins have been reported to induce proteasome-dependent degradation of their target proteins (42, 43). to investigate whether asb-9-induced reduction of  xxxg467xxx  levels was due
to socs box-mediated ubiquitylation of  xxxg467xxx , we co-expressed
myc- xxxg467xxx  with full-length asb-9 or asb-9/⌬sb as well as hajournal of biological chemistry

blot (wb; panels on right) of total cell lysate by an anti-asb-9 polyclonal antibody and anti- xxxg467xxx  antibody, respectively. the expression of asb-9 compared
with creatine kinase in 293t cells is low. a  xxxg467xxx  plasmid was used as a control
in the reverse transcription-pcr experiments. lysate obtained from 293t cells
transfected with 50 ng of flag-asb-9 plasmid was used as a control for the
western blot analysis. the western blot was reprobed with an anti-hsp70
antibody as a loading control.

used per transfection. total cell lysate was immunoblotted with an antickb antibody (upper panels). expression of flag-tagged protein was
determined by an anti-flag western blot (wb; middle panels). actin levels
were also examined in the presence of increasing concentrations of asb-9
to ensure that asb-9 specifically regulates  xxxg467xxx  degradation (lower panels).

ubiquitin. as shown in fig. 9a, little basal polyubiquitylation of
 xxxg467xxx  was observed (lane 3); however, co-expression of asb-9
(lane 4) but not asb-9/⌬sb (lane 5) resulted in enhanced polyubiquitylation of  xxxg467xxx . upon treatment of cultures with the proteasomal inhibitor  xxxd357xxx , a markedly increased level of polyubiquitylated  xxxg467xxx  was observed (lanes 6 – 8). importantly, the
ubiquitylation of  xxxg467xxx  was substantially enhanced on co-expression with asb-9 (lane 7), but to a reduced extent with overexpressed asb-9/⌬sb, supporting our previous observations.
to confirm that the ubiquitylated protein smears observed in
the asb-9 co-transfections (lanes 4 and 7) were due to modification of the myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx  protein by ubiquitin, the blot
was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc (fig. 9b). the reprobe shows a strong band that most likely corresponds to a
monoubiquitylated form of  xxxg467xxx  and was predominant when

discussion
using a proteomic approach, we identified  xxxg467xxx  as a protein
capable of specifically interacting with asb-9.  xxxg467xxx  is a key cytosolic enzyme in cell energy metabolism (reviewed in ref. 44)
reversibly catalyzing the atp-dependent phosphorylation of
creatine and, hence, provides an atp buffering system for
tissues requiring large amounts of energy. subsequent
experiments established that the interaction was unique to
asb-9 and that the ankyrin repeat region was the likely binding site for  xxxg467xxx , since binding was not affected when the
socs box was removed. the identification of  xxxg467xxx  as a possible target protein of asb-9, the presence of elongins b and
c and cullin-5, and the proposed function of the asbs as
ecs-type e3 ubiquitin ligases prompted further analysis into
the biochemical consequences of the asb-9- xxxg467xxx  interaction. using transient and stable transfection techniques as
well as immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we
established that asb-9 overexpression dramatically reduced
endogenous  xxxg467xxx  protein. furthermore, the interaction
resulted in the socs box-dependent ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of  xxxg467xxx . these results suggest that
asb-9 may coordinate a novel molecular mechanism for the
post-translational regulation of cellular  xxxg467xxx .
asb-9 is one of 18 members of the ankyrin repeat-containing
socs box protein family (asbs). the amino acid sequence of
murine asb-9 predicts a 290-amino acid peptide, composed of
a short n-terminal region of ⬃30 amino acids, followed by a
series of six ankyrin repeats (amino acids 31–223) and a c-terminal socs box (amino acids 236 –290). although the asb
family represents the largest family of all socs box-containing

asb-9 was co-expressed. as expected, the band appeared more
intense following treatment with  xxxd357xxx . unmodified mycckb protein was easily detected, and no obvious differences in
levels were observed in the untreated versus  xxxd357xxx -treated
samples. this may be attributed to the immunoprecipitation
process, since an increase in myc-tagged  xxxg467xxx  protein levels
upon  xxxd357xxx  treatment was observed when total cell lysate was
examined via immunoblot with anti-myc (d).
asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  interact in primary cells—
some of the limiting factors in determining if two proteins
interact in vivo are the availability of antibodies and the capacity
of antibodies to detect proteins at the endogenous level. asb-9
is expressed in a limited range of tissues, whereas  xxxg467xxx  displays
a more ubiquitous expression profile. one tissue where both
proteins are expressed and where the monoclonal anti-asb-9
antibody is effective in detecting the endogenous protein is the
testis. lysate was prepared from the testes of c57bl/6 mice and
immunoprecipitated with anti- xxxg467xxx  antibody. following sdspage, the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-asb-9. as
shown in fig. 10, the anti-asb-9 antibody detected the positive
control flag-tagged asb-9 (lane 1) and endogenous asb-9 in
testes (lane 2). importantly, an interaction between asb-9 and
 xxxg467xxx  was also observed, since immunoprecipitation with antickb antibody followed by western blot with anti-asb-9 antibody revealed that asb-9 co-precipitated with  xxxg467xxx  (lane 5) but
was not brought down by an unrelated antibody or protein g
(fig. 10, lanes 3 and 4).

of the socs box and that the interaction of asb-9 with  xxxg467xxx  leads to a
socs box-dependent polyubiquitylation of  xxxg467xxx  and a decline in cellular  xxxg467xxx  levels. furthermore, recent
studies suggest that asb proteins
regulate a number of biological processes by this mechanism (25, 26).
for example, asb-3 was reported to
attenuate  xxxg2301xxx  signaling by
directly targeting  xxxg2301xxx  for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. cellular responses, such as
 xxxg2301xxx -mediated jun n-terminal
kinase activation and apoptosis in
response to tnf-␣, were inhibited
by asb-3 (25).
in this paper, we report that asb-9
is expressed in murine testes and kidneys with low expression in heart and
liver. the expression pattern of  xxxg467xxx 
overlaps with that of asb-9 in some
tissues but is most highly expressed in
tissues with high and fluctuating
energy demands, such as the brain.
we could not detect asb-9 mrna in
murine brain in our studies, although
expression has been reported in the
hypothalamus (genbanktm accession number bb173163.1). interestingly, a detailed investigation
examining creatine kinase isoforms in the brain revealed that

it was proposed that low  xxxg467xxx

 xxxg467xxx  is overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors and
socs box (reviewed in ref. 5).
asb-9 appears to function in a similar manner to sh2-con- tumor cell lines and has been used as a prognostic marker of
taining socs proteins, since the key players that are involved in cancer and metastasis, although this application remains conthe socs-mediated protein degradation pathway are also pres- troversial (27). the  xxxg467xxx  gene is positively regulated by the
ent in the asb-9- xxxg467xxx  complex, specifically cullin-5 and elon- oncogene e1a and negatively regulated by the tumor suppresgins b and c. the sh2-containing socs proteins target key sor gene, p53 (29, 32). also, many growth factors and horsignaling proteins, such as the janus kinases and receptors for mones, such as estrogen, stimulate  xxxg467xxx  activity and expression
degradation by the proteasome, thereby attenuating cytokine (46, 47). estrogen has been shown to highly induce expression
and  xxxg2198xxx  receptor signaling. our results demonstrate of  xxxg467xxx  in the female rat reproductive tract as well
that, similarly to the other socs box-containing proteins, spe- as in human breast tumors and tissues (48). it is not known
cific interaction between asb-9 and  xxxg467xxx  occurs independently which factors induce the expression of asb-9, but it is possible

asb-9-mediated degradation of  xxxg467xxx 

that regulators of  xxxg467xxx  might also exert effects on asb-9 activity
and expression. it has been proposed that the ck system is
involved in tumor growth through regulation of atp production or modulation in an as yet undefined manner. molecules
that disrupt this system may have an impact on tumor growth
or progression. given the interaction of asb-9 with  xxxg467xxx  and
implied roles of asb-2 and asb-8 in cancer, it is tempting to
speculate that asb-9 may also have a role in tumor development, but this will require further study.
it is clear that the physiological significance of the asb-9ckb interaction needs to be further examined. a thorough in
vivo investigation utilizing genetically modified mouse models
will extend the biochemical analyses presented in this paper.
this work is currently in progress and will be essential in defining the biological setting of this novel interplay between asb-9
and  xxxg467xxx .
