abstract
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  rarely cause cardiac arrhythmias by suppressing the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier kq channel encoded by
the human ether-a-go-go-related gene žherg.. epinastine, however, has not been reported to have the adverse effect. we have therefore
compared the effects of epinastine, terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  on herg channels expressed in xenopus oocytes. terfenadine and
 xxxd236xxx  suppressed the herg current with ic 50 of 431 nm and 69 nm, respectively. in contrast, 100 mm epinastine inhibited the
herg current by only 11 " 2.1%. these results may provide an explanation for the difference in the cardiotoxity between different
nonsedating histamine h 1 receptor antagonists. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
second generation nonsedating histamine h 1 receptor
antagonists such as terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , which lack
the adverse effect on the central nervous system, have been
widely used clinically. however, it was recently reported
that these second generation histamine h 1 receptor antagonists sometimes cause cardiac arrhythmias including torsade de pointes, which can cause sudden death žmonahan
et al., 1990; wiley et al., 1992; sakemi and van natta,
1993.. previous studies demonstrated that terfenadine and
 xxxd236xxx  block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current ž i kr . in cardiac myocytes and the
recombinant i kr channel, the human ether-a-go-go-related
gene žherg. žsalata et al., 1995; carmeliet, 1998;
taglialatela et al., 1998.. in cardiac myocytes i kr contributes to termination of the plateau phase of the action
potential. thus, suppression of i kr results in prolongation
of action potential and the qt interval on the electrocardiogram žecg., which can lead to ventricular tachycardia
including torsade de pointes by inducing early after depolarization žjurkiewicz and sanguinetti, 1993..

although epinastine is a nonsedating histamine h 1 receptor antagonist žfuegner et al., 1988., the episodes of
torsade de pointes or sudden death have not been reported
in patients who have received this drug. because another
nonsedating histamine h 1 receptor antagonist, cetirizine,
that has no cardiac side-effects, has been reported to have
a weak inhibitory effect on herg channels žcarmeliet,
1998; taglialatela et al., 1998., we speculated that epinastine may also have little effect on herg channels.
in this study we have compared the effects of epinastine, terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  upon the recombinant i kr
channel, herg, expressed in xenopus oocytes. we find
that unlike terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , epinastine is a very
ineffective blocker of herg channel currents which may
therefore explain the lack of cardiac side-effects obtained
during treatment with this histamine h 1 receptor antagonist.

the expressed channel currents were recorded by conventional two-microelectrode voltage-clamp with a commercially available amplifier žturbo clamp tec 01c,
tamm, germany.. the glass microelectrodes had a resistance of 0.5–1.5 m v when filled with 3 m kcl. oocytes

kcl, 1 mgcl 2 , 1.8  xxxg2125xxx  2 and 5 hepes žph was adjusted
to 7.6 with naoh.. the currents were recorded at room
temperature, and the membrane potential was held at y80
mv. the voltage protocols were described in figure legends.

ingelheim žbiberach, germany.. the chemical structures
of these compounds are shown in fig. 1.  xxxd236xxx  and
terfenadine were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide as 10 mm
stock solutions; the vehicle at the final concentrations did
not affect the herg currents. epinastine was dissolved in
distilled water  xxxd1891xxx  mm.

3. results
xenopus oocytes injected with herg crna expressed
kq channel currents whose properties were very similar to
those of i kr žsanguinetti et al., 1995.. fig. 2a žcontrol.

shows the herg currents elicited by voltage steps ranging
from y120 to q40 mv applied in 10 mv increments
from the holding potential of y80 mv. herg channel
currents were activated in a time-dependent manner with
voltage steps positive to y80 mv. the current–voltage
relationship of herg channel currents evoked by rectangular voltage steps was bell-shaped žfig. 2b.: between
y80 and y10 mv, voltage steps evoked an increasing
herg channel current, while those more positive than
y10 mv evoked progressively smaller herg channel
currents due to the development of c-type inactivation
žsanguinetti et al., 1995.. upon repolarization to y60 mv,
the herg channel tail current rapidly increased and then
gradually decreased to a steady-state value žfig. 2a.. the
former is due to the prompt removal of c-type inactivation
upon repolarization, while the latter reflects the deactivation of herg channels žsanguinetti et al., 1995.. when
the peak of the tail current recorded at y60 mv was
plotted against the membrane potential to which the preceding voltage step had been applied, there was no reduction of cell current following depolarization to positive
membrane potentials. we used the same voltage-clamp
protocol to examine the effects of epinastine,  xxxd236xxx 
and terfenadine on the herg channel currents.
oocytes were superfused with each drug for 10 min
during which time 4 s depolarizing pulses to q20 mv
from the holding potential of y80 mv were applied every
20 s. the application of 1 mm  xxxd236xxx  or 1 mm
terfenadine decreased both steady-state and peak tail currents of herg, which reached a steady-state level within 8
min. 10 min after their application, 1 mm terfenadine and
1 mm  xxxd236xxx  had inhibited the peak herg tail currents by 68 " 7.4% ž n s 5. and 93 " 2.8% ž n s 5., respectively. neither  xxxd236xxx  nor terfenadine significantly
altered the herg current–voltage relationship žfig. 2b..
in contrast, epinastine had much weaker effects on the
herg steady state and tail currents even  xxxd1891xxx  and 100
mm. the inhibition of herg tail current caused by 100
mm epinastine was only 11 " 2.1% ž n s 5.. we further
examined the possibility that epinastine may inhibit herg
channels in a use-dependent manner. the oocytes were
superfused with 100 mm epinastine for 10 min žholding
potential, y80 mv., and then the voltage pulse to 0 mv

and 0.83 for terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , respectively. on
the other hand, epinastine had an almost negligible effect
on herg channels at a concentration of 10 mm, and even
1 mm of the drug inhibited the currents by less than 50%.

4. discussion
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , nonsedating histamine h 1
receptor antagonists, have been reported in some cases to
induce qt prolongation on ecg and a life-threatening
ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes. these adverse
effects of terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have been shown to
be related to block of cardiac i kr žsalata et al., 1995;
carmeliet, 1998; taglialatela et al., 1998.. epinastine is a
novel nonsedating histamine h 1 receptor antagonist that
was launched on the market in countries including japan,
korea, mexico and brazil, from 1994 žfuegner et al.,
1988.. there has been no report that this drug causes
prolongation of the qt interval on ecg and it is not clear
why epinastine, unlike terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , provides no visible adverse effect upon the heart. i kr is coded
by herg, and when herg is expressed in xenopus
oocytes, the current exhibits the properties similar to cardiac i kr . in this study we showed that epinastine exhibited
a negligible effect on the herg current. on the other
hand, terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  blocked herg channels
in a concentration-dependent manner with ic 50 of 431 nm
and 69 nm, respectively, which are compatible with the
recorded plasma levels of these drugs in the patients who
developed the drug-associated qt prolongation žmonahan
et al., 1990; wiley et al., 1992.. in binding experiments for
histamine h 1 receptors, the p k i values žylog dissociation
constant. of epinastine, terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  were
8.9, 7.1 and 8.3, respectively žter laak et al., 1993.. in in
vivo study on histamine-induced skin wheal in mice, the
ic 50 doses žmgrkg, p.o.. were 0.41, 0.71 and 0.22 for
epinastine, terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , respectively
žkomune et al., 1999.. it was, therefore, concluded that
epinastine is relatively selective histamine h 1 receptor
antagonist, with negligible effects on herg channels. the
ic 50 concentration of epinastine to block herg channels
was 1000 times higher than that needed to block histamine
h 1 receptors.
structural differences between epinastine,  xxxd236xxx 
and terfenadine may be related to the different magnitudes
of suppression of herg channel currents by these compounds žfig. 1..  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine have large
carbon chains at the tertiary amine substitutant žfig. 1..
the other nonsedative histamine h 1 receptor antagonists,
cetirizine and loratadine, that has been reported to have a
weak effect on cardiac i kr or herg channels, have a
small substitute at the tertiary amine substitutant
žcarmeliet, 1998; taglialatela et al., 1998.. epinastine has

no amine substitutant. these data suggest that the amine
substitutant is not necessary for the blockade of histamine
h 1 receptor, but seems to be related to the ability of the
compound to block the cardiac i kr . if this is the case, the
tertiary amine moiety interacts with herg channels and
various modifications of this side chain may develop not
only specific histamine h 1 receptor antagonists but also
new drugs affecting herg channels.
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that epinastine
has a negligible suppressive effect on herg channel
currents compared with  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine. this
may at least partially explain the absence of arrhythmogenic effects of the drug. thus, epinastine is a useful
histamine h 1 receptor antagonist for the treatment of
allergic diseases because it is not only nonsedative but also
devoid of cardiotoxic actions.
