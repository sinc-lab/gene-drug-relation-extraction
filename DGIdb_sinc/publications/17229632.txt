background and objectives
activated tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute
leukemia, and represent attractive targets for therapy. sorafenib (bay43-9006,
nexavar®) is a small molecule b-raf inhibitor that is used for the treatment of
renal cell carcinoma, and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine
kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ) and vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ) families. we investigated the efficacy of
sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases pdgfrbeta,  xxxg1279xxx , and
 xxxg801xxx , which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.
design and methods
we tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,  xxxg801xxx  with an internal tandem duplication or d835y point
mutation, and the  xxxg1279xxx (d816v) mutant. the direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies.
results
we show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta and  xxxg801xxx  mutants,
including some of the mutants that confer resistance to  xxxd2642xxx  and other  xxxg801xxx 
inhibitors. sorafenib induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid
leukemia cell lines mv4-11 and molm-13, both expressing  xxxg801xxx  with an internal
tandem duplication, whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid
leukemia cell lines. the imatinib-resistant  xxxg1279xxx (d816v) mutant, associated with systemic mastocytosis, was found to be resistant to sorafenib.
interpretation and conclusions
these results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of
myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of pdgfrbeta and  xxxg801xxx .

yeloproliferative diseases are frequently characterized by the expression of activated tyrosine
kinases such as bcr-abl, jak2(v617f),
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v), fip1l1-pdgfralpha, and  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta.1,2 the
importance of these oncogenic kinases for the proliferation and survival of the leukemic cells has been demonstrated by the use of mouse models, as well as by the clinical application of selective small molecule kinase
inhibitors.3 imatinib, a potent inhibitor of abl,  xxxg1279xxx ,
pdgfralpha and pdgfrbeta, is now used as a standard treatment for bcr-abl-positive chronic myeloid leukemia
(cml), fip1l1-pdgfralpha-positive chronic eosinophilic
leukemia (cel), and  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta-positive chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml).4-6 treatment of these
myeloid malignancies with imatinib results in rapid and
durable responses, but does not eradicate the leukemic
stem cells. in addition to imatinib, a number of other
inhibitors targeting abl,  xxxg1279xxx , pdgfralpha and pdgfrbeta have
been identified and tested in pre-clinical studies.7,8
a mutation of  xxxg801xxx , a member of the class iii receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  family, is the most common tyrosine
kinase mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  xxxg801xxx 
is highly expressed in most patients with aml and
approximately 30% of these patients have activating
mutations in  xxxg801xxx . the most frequent (~25%) is an internal tandem duplication (itd) within the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (jm) region. less frequent (~7%) are point
mutations in the activation loop of the  xxxg2198xxx 
domain, such as the d835y mutation.9 both types of
mutations result in constitutive activation of  xxxg801xxx  and its
downstream signaling pathways, providing the cells with
a proliferative and survival advantage. a number of structurally different  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors have been developed,
including  xxxd2458xxx ,  xxxd3287xxx , and  xxxd2642xxx , and are currently being tested in clinical trials.10-12 in clinical practice, however, the development of resistance to these small molecule inhibitors due to acquired mutations in the target
kinase is an important limitation to the application of
these targeted drugs for cancer therapy. acquired resistance to imatinib has been described in leukemia as well as
in gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (gist).4,13,14 alternatively, primary resistance to imatinib has also been
observed in systemic mastocytosis associated with the
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v) mutant, and in patients with pdgfralpha
(d842v).15,16 not unexpectedly, in a clinical trial to test the
efficacy of  xxxd2642xxx  for the treatment of  xxxg801xxx  mutationpositive aml, acquired resistance due to a point mutation
in the  xxxg801xxx  kinase domain was already observed, indicating that also in aml the development of resistance may
complicate the clinical use of  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors.17
several studies have shown that a mutant form of a
kinase that is resistant to a specific inhibitor may still be
sensitive to small molecule inhibitors with different chemical structures.7,8,18 in order to deal with the problem of
resistance it will be necessary to have several inhibitors
available that target the same kinase and that can be used

consecutively or in combination for cancer therapy. to
further expand our list of available  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors for the treatment of leukemia, we tested the
efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  family tyrosine
kinases. sorafenib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that
was originally developed as an inhibitor of b-raf,19 but
was found to have additional activity against several tyrosine kinases such as  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx , pdgfralpha,  xxxg1279xxx , wild-type
 xxxg801xxx  and oncogenic ret mutants.20,21 we previously
showed that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of fip1l1pdgfralpha and its imatinib-resistant t674i mutant.22 in this
study we tested the efficacy of the kinase inhibitor
sorafenib at inhibiting  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta, imatinib-resistant
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v), activated  xxxg801xxx , as well as  xxxg801xxx  mutants that
are resistant to  xxxd2642xxx .

design and methods
vector construction
cloning of the mscv- xxxg801xxx -itd and mscv-flt3d835y constructs and additional point mutants that
confer resistance to  xxxd2642xxx  was described previously.23
the open reading frames of  xxxg737xxx - xxxg1710xxx  and
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and cloned in the mscv-puro vector
(clontech, mountain view, ca, usa). all constructs
were verified by sequencing.

cell culture
293t cells were grown in dmem medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs). retroviral vectors
were generated by co-transfection of 293t cells with the
mscv constructs and an ecotropic packaging vector.
retroviral vectors were harvested and used to transduce
ba/f3 cells. ba/f3 cells were grown in rpmi-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fbs and mouse interleukin (il)-3
(1 ng/ml). ba/f3 cells were transformed to  xxxg1177xxx -independent growth by expression of the  xxxg2198xxx  constructs
and were then grown in the absence of  xxxg1177xxx . the human
cell lines mv4-11, molm-13, hl-60, k562, kg-1 and
thp-1 were grown in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fbs (mv4-11 and molm-13) or 20% fbs. to
construct dose-response curves, cells were seeded at 3x105
viable cells/ml, and viable cell numbers were determined
at the beginning and after 24 hours (ba/f3 cells) or 48
hours (human cell lines) using the vi-celltm xr cell
counter (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca, usa), based on
trypan blue exclusion.

western blotting
cells were treated with the kinase inhibitor for 90 minutes and then lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 1%
triton x-100 and phosphatase inhibitors. mv4-11 cells
were lysed, using cell lysis buffer from cell signalling
technologies (beverly, ma, usa), and the  xxxg801xxx  protein

activity of sorafenib against  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,  xxxg1279xxx (d816v),
 xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx (d835y)
sorafenib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor with
potent activity against b-raf, but it is also known to
inhibit a subset of tyrosine kinases, including  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  and
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  family tyrosine kinases.20 we have recently shown
that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of fip1l1-pdgfralpha and
its imatinib-resistant t674i mutant form.22 to determine
the potency of sorafenib to inhibit other common oncogenic mutants of the  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  family tyrosine kinases
pdgfrbeta,  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg801xxx , we tested the effect of sorafenib
on the proliferation of ba/f3 cells transformed by etv6pdgfrbeta,  xxxg1279xxx (d816v),  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx (d835y).
treatment of ba/f3 cells expressing  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,
 xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx (d835y) with sorafenib resulted in a
dose-dependent inhibition of their proliferation (figure
1a). in contrast, treatment of ba/f3 cells expressing
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v) with sorafenib had no effect, and even at 1
µm sorafenib no significant decrease in proliferation or
survival was observed (figure 1a). for ba/f3 cells transformed by  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx (d835y), a
50% inhibition of cell proliferation was observed at 50
nm, 2 nm and 500 nm, respectively.
western blot analysis confirmed that the effect on proliferation was due to a direct inhibition of the activated
kinases  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx (d835y),
while there was no visible effect on the phosphorylation
of  xxxg1279xxx (d816v) (figure 1b). treatment of the correspon-

(amersham biosciences, munich, germany). sorafenib
was custom synthesized and a 10 mm stock was stored in
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) at -20°c. dilutions were
made in rpmi-1640 medium immediately before use.

sorafenib on proliferation of ba/f3 cells expressing  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,

confirmed a direct inhibitory effect of sorafenib on  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,
 xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx (d835y). phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 decreased
in parallel. sorafenib had no visible effect on phosphorylation of
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v).

ding ba/f3 cells with an increasing dose of sorafenib also
resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2, downstream effectors of  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta and
 xxxg801xxx -mediated transformation. in ba/f3 cells transformed
by  xxxg1279xxx (d816v) there was no effect of sorafenib on
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, indicating that the inhibitor has
no direct effect on  xxxg1279xxx (d816v) or mapk signaling in
these cells. in all transformed ba/f3 cells studied, the effect
on phosphorylation of the target tyrosine kinases or
 xxxg1369xxx /2 correlated with the inhibition of cell proliferation.

tion of  xxxg1369xxx /2 downstream of  xxxg801xxx  was observed
(figure 2b). sorafenib not only inhibited the proliferation of these cells, but also induced apoptosis and block
of their cell cycle. after 48 hours’ treatment with 100
nm sorafenib, the total population of dead cells of mv411 and molm-13 had increased from 19.2% to 66.9%
and from 22.0% to 61.1%, respectively, with a clear
population of apoptotic cells present (figure 3). in contrast, no significant increase in the numbers of apoptotic cells could be detected for hl-60, k562, kg-1 and
thp-1 under these conditions (figure 3).
in addition, treatment of mv4-11 and molm-13 cells
for 48 hours with 100 nm sorafenib resulted in an
increase of cells in the g0/g1 phase of the cell cycle, documenting a cell cycle arrest in the sorafenib-treated cells
(figure 4).

duplication in the juxtamembrane domain of  xxxg801xxx  was
confirmed in both cell lines by pcr (data not shown).
proliferation of the cell lines was significantly decreased
by treatment with increasing doses of sorafenib, and
50% inhibition of proliferation was obtained at 3 nm
and 10 nm for mv4-11 and molm-13, respectively
(figure 2a). sorafenib doses up to 100 nm had no effect
on the proliferation of four other human myeloid cell
lines that do not express mutant  xxxg801xxx  (figure 2c).
due to the low level of expression of  xxxg801xxx  in the
molm-13 and mv4-11 cell lines, we could only detect
 xxxg801xxx  after immunoprecipitation in mv4-11 cells.
analysis of the phosphorylation status of  xxxg801xxx -itd in
the mv4-11 cells confirmed a direct effect of sorafenib
on  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in these cells (figure 2b). in

using an in vitro mutagenesis approach we have
recently identified mutations in the atp-binding
domain of  xxxg801xxx  that confer resistance to the small molecule inhibitor  xxxd2642xxx .23 we next tested whether these
mutations also confer resistance to sorafenib. the different point mutations that confer resistance to  xxxd2642xxx 
were cloned in the  xxxg801xxx -itd background and expressed
in ba/f3 cells. at a concentration of 100 nm sorafenib,
at least 50% inhibition of cell growth was observed for
four of the mutants: a627t, n676k, n676y, and
n676d. mutations at positions a627 and n676 thus
only cause a mild shift in the sensitivity of  xxxg801xxx -itd to
sorafenib. for the g697r point mutation ~200 nm
sorafenib was required to obtain a 50% inhibition of
proliferation.  xxxg801xxx -itd with a point mutation at position 691 (f691l and f691i) was less sensitive to
sorafenib, and treatment with 1000 nm of inhibitor
reduced the proliferation by less than 40% (figure 5).
western blot analysis of the phosphorylation status of
 xxxg801xxx  yielded comparable results, indicating that the
f691i and f691l point mutations confer a high level of
resistance to sorafenib (ic50 >1000 nm), with no complete inhibition of phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx  even  xxxd1891xxx 
µm. the other tested mutants remain sensitive to
sorafenib at concentrations below 500 nm (ic50 values
between 10 and 200 nm) (figure 5). the g697r mutant,
known to be resistant to a variety of  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors,
appears to be completely dephosphorylated after treatment with 1000 nm of sorafenib, confirming that this
mutant remains sensitive to sorafenib, although at slightly higher concentrations than  xxxg801xxx -itd without additional mutations in the atp-binding domain (figure 5).
we also tested whether the n676d mutation would
confer resistance to sorafenib in the context of  xxxg801xxx 
(d835y). ba/f3 cells transformed by  xxxg801xxx (d835y)
n676d were highly resistant to sorafenib, with a cellu-

figure 3. induction of apoptosis in human aml cell lines and not
in other myeloid cell lines. apoptosis assay of human aml cell
lines after 48 hours treatment with 100 nm sorafenib. in mv4-11
and molm-13 cells there was a clear induction of apoptosis,
whereas no significant influence on the apoptotic populations of
hl-60, k562, kg-1 or thp-1 cells was observed after 48 hours of
treatment with sorafenib.

molecularly targeted therapy for the treatment of cancer has been introduced with various levels of success.
treatment of bcr-abl-positive cml, fip1l1pdgfra-positive cel and  xxxg737xxx - xxxg1710xxx -positive
cmml with the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor imatinib has
been quite successful, and most patients achieve a
durable complete hematologic response.4-6 treatment of
bcr-abl-positive cml patients in blast crisis, however, has been more difficult. despite the fact that most of
these patients initially show a response to imatinib therapy, many of them relapse due to the development of
resistance to imatinib through acquisition of additional
mutations in the kinase domain.13 interestingly, some of
the mutants that are resistant to imatinib remain sensitive to small molecule inhibitors with different structural properties.7,8,22 these observations indicate that
patients who become resistant to one inhibitor could
still be treated successfully with other inhibitors, and
that it is important to test a variety of inhibitors for their
activity against oncogenic kinases and their respectively
known resistant mutants. this strategy is currently
being tested in the context of bcr-abl-positive cml in
which imatinib-resistant patients are being treated with
novel inhibitors such as amn107 and  xxxd1815xxx .7,25

different responses are obtained depending on the mutation in the atpbinding domain of  xxxg801xxx . western blot analysis confirmed a direct effect
of sorafenib on phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx  in the responding cell lines. a
decrease in  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation is also shown in these cell lines.

given the central role of  xxxg801xxx  mutations in the pathogenesis of aml,  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors have been developed
and are currently being tested in clinical trials. however,
based on the experience with imatinib resistance in
cml in blast crisis, the development of resistance to
 xxxg801xxx  inhibitors is also likely to occur in aml, and,
indeed, has already been observed in one aml patient
in a clinical trial of  xxxd2642xxx .17 at the time of relapse, this
patient had acquired a n676k mutation in the atpbinding domain of  xxxg801xxx , which was shown to confer
resistance to  xxxd2642xxx . using an in vitro mutagenesis
screen, we have recently identified four different positions in the atp-binding site of  xxxg801xxx  that, when mutated, confer resistance to  xxxd2642xxx , further documenting
that resistance to  xxxd2642xxx  can develop due to mutations
in the kinase domain of  xxxg801xxx .23
in this study we tested the efficacy of sorafenib at
inhibiting the activated tyrosine kinases  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta,
 xxxg801xxx -itd,  xxxg801xxx (d835y), and  xxxg1279xxx (d816v). we demonstrated that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of oncogenic
mutants of  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  family tyrosine kinases pdgfrbeta and
 xxxg801xxx .  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta and  xxxg801xxx -itd are inhibited with
cellular ic50 values below 50 nm, while  xxxg801xxx  with the
d835y activating mutation is slightly less sensitive to
sorafenib with a cellular ic50 value of approximately 500

nm. steady-state serum concentrations of sorafenib up
to 4 µm could be safely achieved in patients with a dose
of 100 mg/day.26,27 since  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta and  xxxg801xxx -itd
are completely inhibited at sorafenib concentrations
below 1000 nm, an efficacious dose may be 100 mg/day
or lower for  xxxg737xxx -pdgfrbeta and  xxxg801xxx -itd positive
patients.  xxxg801xxx (d835y) was found to be less sensitive to
sorafenib, with a cellular ic50 value of ~500 nm. since
this is still eight times below the achievable serum concentration, it can be expected that sorafenib could be
used to inhibit  xxxg801xxx (d835y).
in contrast, our results illustrate that the corresponding d816v mutation in  xxxg1279xxx  confers a high level of
resistance to sorafenib, with a cellular ic50 value >1 µm.
these data indicate that related tyrosine kinases that are
sensitive to a specific small molecule inhibitor in their
wild type configuration do not necessarily have a similar resistance mutation profile.
in addition, we analyzed the potency of sorafenib to
override resistance to  xxxd2642xxx  and other  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors
caused by mutations in the atp-binding domain of
 xxxg801xxx . our data indicate that mutations of the amino
acids alanine 626 (a626), asparagine 676 (n676) and
glycine 697 ( xxxg697xxx ) cause a shift in the sensitivity of
 xxxg801xxx -itd to sorafenib, but do not confer a high level of

resistance. in contrast, a mutation of phenylalanine 691
(f691) to either leucine or isoleucine resulted in a large
shift of the ic50 value for sorafenib to more than 1 µm.
these results suggest that a number of the mutations
that confer resistance to  xxxd2642xxx  remain sensitive to
sorafenib, including the g697r mutation, previously
shown to confer high level resistance to  xxxd2642xxx ,
 xxxd847xxx , and  xxxd2415xxx .23 finally, the n676d mutation was

also analyzed in the context of  xxxg801xxx (d835y). given the
fact that  xxxg801xxx (d835y) is already less sensitive than
 xxxg801xxx -itd to sorafenib, it could be expected that this
extra mutation would confer additional resistance to
sorafenib. we confirmed that  xxxg801xxx (d835y)-n676d was
indeed highly resistant to sorafenib. these data indicate
that resistance in the context of  xxxg801xxx (d835y) could
occur with a broader range of mutations than in the
context of  xxxg801xxx -itd. these observations also suggest
that it could be important to consider higher doses of
sorafenib for the treatment of  xxxg801xxx (d835y)-positive
aml than for  xxxg801xxx -itd-positive aml.
sorafenib has recently been approved by the fda for
the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, which opens possibilities for the introduction of this compound in the
treatment of patients with leukemias with activated
pdgfrbeta or  xxxg801xxx . unfortunately, our data do not support a role for sorafenib in the treatment of imatinibresistant mastocytosis associated with the common
 xxxg1279xxx (d816v) mutation. sorafenib may remain a valuable
inhibitor for the treatment of leukemias and solid
tumors with other types of activating  xxxg1279xxx  mutations,
which remain to be investigated. it is unlikely that
sorafenib will be useful as a single agent for the treatment of aml but, given the fact that sorafenib is well
tolerated and that  xxxg801xxx -itd is inhibited by sorafenib at
low nanomolar concentrations, combinations of
sorafenib with chemotherapy may open new possibilities to improve the treatment of aml patients, as has
been described for other  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors. further studies
addressing the potential of such combinations are warranted.
