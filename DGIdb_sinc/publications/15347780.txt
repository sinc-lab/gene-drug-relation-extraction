aim

to investigate potential biological mechanisms underlying mcs in a case–control
study.

methods

two hundred and twenty-three mcs cases and 194 controls (urban females, aged
30–64 years) fulfilled reproducible eligibility criteria with discriminant validity.
routine laboratory results and serum levels of volatile organic compounds (vocs)
were compared. dose–response relationships, a criterion for causality, were
examined linking exposures to likelihood of case status.

results

routine laboratory investigations revealed clinically unimportant case–control
differences in means. confounder-adjusted odds ratios (or) showed mcs was
negatively associated with lymphocyte count and total plasma homocysteine,
positively associated with mean cell haemoglobin concentration, alanine
aminotransferase and serum  xxxd3049xxx , and not associated with thyroid stimulating
hormone, folate or serum  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx . more cases than controls had detectable
serum chloroform (p = 0.001) with the or for detectability 2.78 (95% confidence
interval = 1.73–4.48, p < 0.001). chloroform levels were higher in cases. however,
cases had significantly lower means of detectable serum levels of ethylbenzene,
m&p-xylene, 3-methylpentane and hexane, and means of all serum levels of 1,3,5and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 2- and 3-methylpentane, and m&p-xylene.

conclusions our findings are inconsistent with proposals that mcs is associated with vitamin
deficiency or thyroid dysfunction, but the association of lower lymphocyte counts
with an increased likelihood of mcs is consistent with theories of immune
dysfunction in mcs. whether avoidance of exposures or different metabolic
pathways in cases explain the observed lower voc levels or the higher chloroform
levels should be investigated.

background multiple chemical sensitivity (mcs), although poorly understood, is associated with
considerable morbidity.

c. j. baines et al.: case–control study of multiple chemical sensitivity 409

analysis of uths responses revealed that two mcs
features described by nethercott et al. [31], namely
‘symptoms linked to low-level exposure resolving with
removal of the exposure’ and ‘symptom chronicity’,
differentiated female respondents attending environmental medicine practices (with a high likelihood of
mcs) from those attending general practices (with a low
likelihood) [20]. furthermore, combinations of four
self-reported uths symptoms also discriminated
between women from these two practice types. the four
symptoms were a stronger sense of smell than others
have; feeling dull or groggy; feeling spacey; and difficulty
concentrating. to achieve discrimination required either a
stronger sense of smell than others or, in the absence of
that symptom, any two of the three remaining uths
symptoms [20].

materials and methods

study conduct

development of case-definition
the university of toronto health survey (uths) is a
reproducible, self-administered questionnaire, designed
to assess symptoms, exposures linked to symptoms and
specific mcs ‘features’ described in six previously
published mcs case-definitions [4,27–31]. the uths
was sent to 4126 individuals attending four practice
types: family medicine, allergy, occupational medicine
and environmental medicine; 61.7% responded [32]. our

selection of cases and controls
prior uths response was required to enable application
of eligibility criteria. only responders who had
volunteered to participate in future research studies were
approached. eligible participants were female toronto
residents, age 30–64 years and not pregnant, attending
any participating environmental, allergy, occupational or
family practices, the women’s college hospital (wch)
environmental health clinic (ehc), or the wch
family practice health center. cases were required to
fulfil both nethercott features and either of the two
discriminatory combinations of uths symptoms, as
described above [20]. controls, drawn only from family
practices, were ineligible if they reported either of the two
nethercott features or a stronger sense of smell than
others or more than one of the other three uths
symptoms.
potential cases (493) and controls (481) received
invitation letters requesting they notify study investigators
if unwilling to participate. otherwise, recipients were
telephoned (eight attempts) and invited to enrol.
ultimately, we recruited 223 cases and 194 controls, a 64
and 50% response, respectively, of those reached and
eligible. forty-six controls reported one uths symptom
and the remainder none.

ethical review boards at wch, an affiliated teaching
hospital, and the university approved the protocol. the
study proceeded through the autumn and winter of
1997–1998 at the wch ehc. participants arrived
fasting for morning appointments. criteria and results for
laboratory methods are available as supplementary data
at occupational medicine online.
analysis
we used descriptive statistics for haematological,

described as medically unexplained [3], disabling
multi-organ symptoms triggered by multiple incitants
with toxicant-induced loss of tolerance to chemicals
[1,4,5], somatization disorder [6,7], irrational fear of
chemicals [8] and panic attacks paired with non-noxious
stimuli [9,10].
complex hypotheses have been developed to explain
increased sensitivity to environmental exposures
including: an immunological mechanism [11,12] that
others dispute [13,14]; psychoneuroimmunology linking
stress to the down-regulation of the immune system [15];
neural sensitization with progressive amplification of
behavioural and neurochemical host responses [16];
neurogenic inflammation [17] with the binding of an
irritant molecule to sensory nerve c-fibers [18] triggering
the release of the inflammatory  xxxg2240xxx . recently, the
vomeronasal organ and its possible role in mcs has been
described [19], providing a mechanism for symptoms
arising from very low-level exposures and consistent with
the altered sense of smell reported by mcs patients
[20,21].
environmental exposures to chemicals seem an
essential element of mcs. we therefore conducted a
case–control study to determine which, if any, serum
volatile organic compounds (vocs) may be increased
and which may be decreased [22] in mcs patients
compared with people without mcs. we also examined
whether mcs is associated with increased serum
pesticides or with altered liver function, the latter a
possible indicator of impaired enzymatic ability to
‘detoxify’ chemicals [1,4,5]. additionally, our laboratory
protocol for identifying major co-morbidity allowed
consideration of other hypothesized mechanisms involved
in mcs. low blood counts could be related to decreased
energy or decreased immune function. abnormal glucose
metabolism, including hypoglycaemic episodes, might
cause fatigue [23], as could reduced thyroid function
[16,24].  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  metabolism could be associated
with cognitive symptoms [25], which are a feature of
mcs [3,20].  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency might explain
diminished immune competence, bloating and irritability
[26].

results
cases and controls did not differ significantly with
respect to age, marital status, educational background,
daily smoking or daily passive smoking, although before
logarithmic transformation, they did differ on the mean
numbers of cigarettes smoked (table 1). cases were
significantly more likely to have been born in canada and
to report vsu.
routine laboratory results
as shown in table 2, mean cell haemoglobin
concentration (mchc) was higher in cases (p = 0.002)
while mean lymphocyte count was lower (p = 0.004),
both retaining significance after adjustment for age and

smoking (data not shown). mean values for remaining
haematology variables were similar for cases and controls
(online table 3), but cases were more likely to fall outside
the reference interval for eosinophils (p = 0.03) and
neutrophils (p = 0.02) (data not shown). mean
alanine-aminotransferase (alt) was higher in cases (p =
0.007) (table 2), even after adjustment (data not shown)
for  xxxd3049xxx  levels (p = 0.01). while cases and controls
differed on alcohol intake, alt was not associated with
alcohol nor with tea and coffee. mean tsh, creatinine,
fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels, the
homa index and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase
(ggtp) were almost identical, comparing cases and
controls (online table 4). adjusting for age and smoking
had no effect (data not shown).
table 3 shows that higher levels of vitamins b12 and b6
were observed in cases even after stratification, with the
differences significant for all strata combined both crude
and adjusted for vsu. in contrast, the higher levels of
folate seen in cases compared with controls were not
observed after vsu stratification, although adjustment for
vsu did yield a statistically significant difference. plasma
homocysteine was lower for cases than controls among
users of vitamin supplements, but not among non-users.
adjustment for vsu showed a non-significant difference
at the p = 0.08 level. neither removal of outliers nor
adjustment for smoking and age changed these findings
(data not shown).
table 4 shows dose–response relationships which are
not always monotonic. higher mchc and lower
erythrocyte and lymphocyte counts were significantly
associated with an increased probability of being a case.
crude and adjusted ors show that alt levels above
quartile 1 were associated with an increased risk of being
a case. however, no dose–response relationship was
observed for other biochemistry variables. dose–response
relationships are also displayed in table 4 for  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx ,
folate, total homocysteine and  xxxd3049xxx . after
adjustment, only higher  xxxd3049xxx  was associated with
an increased likelihood of being a case (p = 0.02), while
higher homocysteine was associated with reduced risk
(p = 0.10).

volatile organic compounds
first, with respect to detectability, higher proportions
of cases (table 5) had detectable levels of chloroform
(or = 2.78, p < 0.001) and benzene (or = 1.48,
p = 0.06). significantly lower proportions of cases had
detectable levels of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (p = 0.04),
2-methylpentane (p = 0.007), 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene
(p = 0.01), 3-methylpentane (p = 0.03) and hexane
(p = 0.02). one hundred per cent p,p′-dde detectability
occurred in cases and controls. none of the other
pesticides tested for were detectable.

biochemical and voc results. we compared univariate
case–control differences in means and proportions using
chi2 and t-tests, with natural log (ln) transformations when
required. we used tobit regression analysis when
distribution of the dependent variable was concentrated
at the lower limit and when values above that limit
covered a wide range. this allowed actual values of the
dependent variable to be modelled while accounting for
concentration of values at the limit [33]. we calculated
the homeostasis model assessment (homa) index for
insulin resistance [34].
sample volumes met the pre-specified instrument
detection limits (idl) for 21 vocs and one pesticide (see
online table 2). we report results for analytes yielding a
case–control difference meeting p < 0.10, namely:
chloroform, benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, 1,3,5- and
1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 2- and 3-methylpentane, hexane,
m&p-xylene and 1,1-dichloro–2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)
ethylene (p,p′-dde). we compared ‘mean detectable’
(md) statistics, calculated as the mean of values at and
above the idl, for cases and controls with detectable
voc levels. ‘mean of all’ (moa) statistics were averages
including voc levels above, at and below the idl, the
latter treated as idl equivalent.
logistic
regression
estimated
dose–response
relationships. based on the control distribution, we
divided exposure measures into roughly equal groups.
odds ratios (ors) revealed the associations between
levels of exposure and probability of being a case. when
appropriate, multivariate logistic regression [35]
controlled for potential confounders [birth in canada
(bic), vitamin supplement use (vsu) within 24 h of
venepuncture, currently smoke daily or most days, age,
and coffee, tea and alcohol intake]. analysis of thyroid
stimulating hormone (tsh) results was controlled for
thyroid medication use.
correlation coefficients for combined case–control
data evaluated the relationship between liver function
tests and analytes listed above.

secondly, with respect to mean voc levels, chloroform
levels were higher in cases than controls, significantly for
moa. levels of p,p′-dde were similar in cases and
controls. for all other vocs, levels were consistently
lower in cases with varying degrees of significance
whether expressed as md or moa levels. moa levels
were significantly lower in cases for 1,3,5-trimethyl-

benzene (p = 0.02), 2-methylpentane (p = 0.02),

of being a case. ethylbenzene, 3-methylpentane, hexane,
m&p-xylene and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene levels were
negatively associated with varying degrees of significance.
only m&p-xylene and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene exhibited a
monotonic dose–response relationship. no associations
were found between alt and any of the vocs listed
in table 5. ggtp was negatively associated with
ethylbenzene (beta = –0.19, p = 0.02) and 1,2,3trimethylbenzene (beta = –0.33, p = 0.02). (online table
5 shows associations involving other vocs and ggtp.)

discussion
we believe this study using mcs cases and controls
meeting validated exclusion and inclusion criteria is
unique [20]. others based a case definition on
symptom-causing exposures [36]. by basing our case
definition on symptoms, we avoided the risk of
incorrectly attributing symptoms to specific exposures.
our case definition is a major strength of this paper.
nevertheless, our case–control differences require
replication to avoid problems of multiple significance

testing. the potential for confounding exists, particularly
with respect to behaviour, diet and social factors for
which data were not collected. however, our analysis
adjusted for potential confounding by bic, alcohol,
coffee, tea and smoking.
the relatively low compliance rate in agreeing to
participate in this study precludes generalizing our
findings to all mcs cases. bias could arise in our
case–control comparisons if there were self-selection bias
involving exposures which differed between cases and
controls. we do not believe the decision to participate was
influenced by mcs-related variables.
our statistically significant (although clinically unimportant) case–control differences deserve attention given
the potential relevance to some proposed biological
mechanisms for mcs.

routine laboratory results
we ruled out serious co-morbidity from anaemia, liver
disease, diabetes, kidney disease and hypothyroidism.
there were no exclusions because of medical conditions.
mchc case–control differences persisted (p = 0.001)
after adjustment for alt, b12, tsh, folate, alcohol and
smoking, all variables associated with megaloblastic
anaemia, which is itself associated with elevated mchc
(data not shown) [37]. although the difference in means
was very small, the more than double increased risk of

being a case was confined to those in the upper quartile.
whether this reflects biology or chance requires further
investigation in the context of social and dietary factors.
although the lower mean lymphocyte count in cases
(p = 0.004) was clinically unimportant, these lower
counts were associated with an increased likelihood of
case status even after adjustment. the relative lymphocytopenia and negative dose–response relationship
observed in cases is consistent with speculation that there
is down-regulation of the immune system in mcs [15].
eosinophils synthesize, store and secrete nerve growth
factor [38]. although the higher mean count in cases was
not statistically significant, significantly more cases had
eosinophil counts higher than the reference interval,
consistent with the neurogenic inflammation hypothesis
[17]. however, small numbers (21 versus 9) rule out
anything other than a minor potential role in explaining
mcs.
abnormal glucose metabolism, including hypoglycaemic episodes, could cause fatigue in mcs [23], but
our findings support neither this nor the possibility that
mcs cases have reduced thyroid function [16,24] as
determined by tsh.
 xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  metabolism was investigated because of
its association with neurological symptoms [25]. because
b12 serum levels may not reflect tissue supply, we

findings support neither the clinical observations nor the
hypothesis that b6 deficiency is linked to diminished
immune competence in mcs [26].
volatile organic compounds
environmental analyses routinely use the conservative
method detection limit (mdl) as a reporting limit. in
contrast, clinical laboratories in the usa that provide
voc scans to north american physicians treating mcs
patients use idls. by using idls, we enabled these
clinicians to make direct comparisons of our voc levels
with their clinical experience. additionally, idls
captured more measurements than mdls for analysis.

some case–control differences may be masked because
we recruited prevalent cases who might have modified
their behaviour to avoid exposures causing symptoms.
incident cases could not be recruited because the
recognition of mcs is generally retrospective.
increased susceptibility to adverse effects from
environmental chemicals due to an impaired enzymatic
ability to detoxify ‘intoxicants’ has been hypothesized for
mcs. either increased or decreased serum voc levels
could be relevant indicators [1]. rapid metabolizers may
have lower levels of a compound and experience toxicity
from a reactive intermediate, while slow metabolizers may
have increased levels and experience toxicity from the

conclusions
this study identified case–control differences for
mchc, lymphocytes,  xxxd3049xxx  and homocysteine. of
great interest are the voc measurements, particularly the
increased likelihood of chloroform detectability (or =
2.78, p < 0.001) and the higher chloroform levels in
cases. replication is required.
dose–response relationships are a major criterion for
establishing causality and several were shown. the
lymphocyte count demonstrated a strictly monotonic
relationship, with higher counts reducing the risk of being
a case. for vocs, the likelihood of being a case doubled
in quartiles 2–4 for chloroform. in contrast, the likelihood
of being a case was lower in quartiles above 1 for
ethylbenzene, 3-methyl pentane, hexane, m&p-xylene
and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene. only for the latter two is the
relationship monotonic.
research is required to confirm our results and clarify
underlying mechanisms in mcs. what metabolic
pathways are involved and how do they differ between
cases and controls?

parent compound [22]. our results are consistent with
these hypotheses; we showed increases in some vocs and
decreases in others.
the three chloroform measures were higher in cases,
significantly so for the proportion with detectable levels
and the moa. airborne contamination during venepuncture or sample preparation was unlikely because
samples were handled identically. laboratory blanks were
not contaminated. chloroform exposure could arise from
drinking chlorinated tap water or inhaling chlorinated
water vapour during showers [42,43]. we did not collect
information on water use. other possible explanations are
impaired detoxification or excretion of chloroform, or
increased absorption and/or storage. chloroform was not
correlated with liver function tests. given chloroform’s
anaesthetic properties, its relationship with mcsassociated cognitive symptoms warrants investigation.
lower proportions of cases had detectable levels for
eight of eleven analytes. except for chloroform and
p,p′-dde, cases also had lower md and moa levels.
excluding chloroform, styrene and p,p′-dde, the vocs
listed in table 5 are gasoline constituents [44]. mainstream cigarette smoke contains benzene, ethylbenzene,
styrene and m&p-xylene [43], the latter three showing
significantly lower means in cases. possible explanations
for lower levels in cases include avoidance of exposure to
vehicular exhaust and passive smoking, more rapid voc
breakdown or enhanced tissue storage.
for 2-methyl pentane, both the moa and the
proportion with detectable levels were significantly lower
in cases. 2-methyl pentane is primarily exhaled. if cases
hyperventilate more than controls [9], it could explain
lower levels.
styrene is in indoor air and occurs in food both
naturally and after storage in polystyrene containers [45].
the md styrene level was lower in cases than controls.
similar p,p′-dde levels in cases and controls suggest
similar exposure and metabolic pathways. levels of all
other pesticides were undetectable in cases and controls.
because liver function and voc metabolism were
possible related, we measured alt, a marker for hepatocellular injury which is decreased in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency
and increased by some drugs and liver disease [37]. the
significantly higher mean alt level in cases, even after
adjusting for  xxxd3049xxx  and vsu, and the significant but
not monotonic dose–response relationship might indicate
increased enzyme induction in cases and represent
slightly impaired detoxification, consistent with mcs
being a toxicant-induced condition [1,5]. ggtp, a
microsomal enzyme increased by drugs, alcohol,
xenobiotics, infection and cancer, reflects liver function
[37,46]. the absence of a ggtp case–control difference
suggests similar exposures and morbidity for these
variables.
