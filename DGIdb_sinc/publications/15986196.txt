effect of repeated administrations of heroin, naltrexone,
methadone, and alcohol on morphine glucuronidation in the rat
received: 14 december 2004 / accepted: 11 april 2005 / published online: 29 june 2005

abstract rationale: heroin is rapidly metabolized to
morphine that in turn is transformed in morphine-3-glucuronide (m3g), an inactive metabolite, and morphine-6glucuronide (m6g), a potent mu-opioid receptor (mor)
agonist. we have found that heroin addicts exhibit higher
m6g/m3g ratios relative to morphine-treated control subjects. we have also shown that heroin-treated rats exhibit
measurable levels of m6g (which is usually undetectable in
this species) and reduced levels of m3g. objective: we
investigated the role of mor in these effects of heroin, by
examining the effects of methadone, a mor agonist, and of
naltrexone, a mor antagonist, on morphine glucuronidation. we also investigated the effects of alcohol, which is
known to alter drug metabolism and is frequently coabused
by heroin addicts. methods: morphine glucuronidation
was studied in liver microsomes obtained from rats exposed
daily for 10 days to saline, heroin (10 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrexone (20–40 mg/kg, i.p.), heroin + naltrexone (10 mg/kg+
20–40 mg/kg, i.p.), methadone (5–20 mg/kg, i.p.), or 10%
ethanol. results: heroin induced the synthesis of m6g
and decreased the synthesis of m3g. naltrexone exhibited
intrinsic modulatory activity on morphine glucuronidation, increasing the synthesis of m3g via a low-affinity/
high-capacity reaction characterized by positive cooperativity. the rate of m3g synthesis in the heroin + naltrexone groups was not different from that of the naltrexone
groups. methadone and ethanol induced a modest increase
in m3g synthesis and had no effect on m6g synthesis.
conclusion: the effects of heroin on morphine glucuronidation are not shared by methadone or alcohol (two drugs
that figure prominently in the natural history of heroin addiction) and do not appear to depend on the activation of mor.

introduction
morphine metabolism in mammals mainly consists of the
mutually exclusive glucuronidation of the phenolic (position 3) and alcoholic (position 6) hydroxyl moieties (milne
et al. 1996). being more hydrophilic than the parent compound, morphine-3-glucuronide (m3g) and morphine-6glucuronide (m6g) do not easily cross the blood–brain
barrier and undergo renal clearance as rapidly as creatinine
(meineke et al. 2002). nevertheless, glucuronidation does
not terminate the effects of morphine, because m6g, unlike
m3g, is a potent agonist to mu-opioid peptide receptors
(mors) (ulens et al. 2001; penson et al. 2000; christrup
1997). indeed, there is now substantial evidence that m6g
contributes to both analgesic and toxic effects of morphine.
m6g has been shown to produce analgesia when administered systemically (romberg et al. 2004, skarke et al.
2003) and is now under development as a therapeutic agent
(bayes et al. 2004). furthermore, increasingly high blood
levels of m6g due to impaired excretion might account for
the central nervous system (cns)-depressant effects produced by repeated morphine administrations in patients
with renal failure (pauli-magnus et al. 1999; peterson et al.
1990). m6g may also be implicated in the well-known
individual differences in the responsiveness to morphine.
for example, the unusual resistance to morphine overdosing exhibited by some nephropatic patients has been attributed to a single-nucleotide polymorphism of the mor
gene producing reduced responsiveness to m6g, but not to
morphine (lotsch et al. 2002). moreover, fugelstad et al.
(2003) have hypothesized that individual variability in ugt
activity may help explain cases of sudden death among
heroin users. not surprisingly, m3g/m6g ratio is now
routinely assessed in clinical investigations of morphineinduced analgesia.
we have recently reported that the m3g/m6g ratio in
plasma and urine of heroin addicts is significantly lower

59

than in heroin-naive individuals treated with morphine for
pain control (antonilli et al. 2003a). interestingly enough,
low m3g/m6g ratios were observed even in abstinent heroin addicts receiving morphine for pain control. these
findings are in agreement with the report by von euler et al.
(2003) of negligible urinary levels of m3g in some heroin addicts, despite the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine
(6-mam).
in an attempt to shed some light on the mechanisms
responsible for the reduced m3g/m6g ratio in heroin
addicts, we investigated the effects of repeated administrations of heroin on morphine glucuronidation in the rat
(antonilli et al. 2003b), a species that, under basal conditions, produces negligible levels of m6g. we found that
rats that had received repeated heroin administration exhibited detectable plasma levels of m6g, which was absent
in rats repeatedly treated with saline or morphine. furthermore, microsomal preparations obtained from the livers
of heroin-treated rats yielded, when incubated with morphine, measurable quantities of m6g (which was not detectable in microsomal preparations from rats treated with
saline or morphine). repeated heroin administration also affected the synthesis of m3g. indeed, the microsomal preparations obtained from heroin-treated rats produced less
m3g than those obtained from saline- or morphine-injected
rats. acute administration of heroin had no effect on the
synthesis of either glucuronide.
the fact that repeated administrations of medium to high
doses of morphine (10–40 mg/kg per 10 days) failed to
alter the synthesis of m6g may suggest that the ability of
heroin to induce the synthesis of this active metabolite does
not depend on its actions at mor. the first goal of the present
study was to investigate the effects of other pharmacological manipulations of the opioid system on morphine
metabolism. in two independent experiments, we studied
the effects on morphine metabolism of repeated administrations of naltrexone, a mor antagonist, and of methadone, a nonphenanthrenic mor agonist. our interest in
naltrexone and methadone was also related to the role these
two drugs play in the therapy of heroin addiction. the
second goal of our study was to investigate the effects on
morphine glucuronidation produced by alcohol, which is
known to alter the metabolism of various drugs (klotz and
ammon 1998; narayan et al. 1991) and is frequently coabused by heroin addicts.

materials and methods

treatments
experiment 1
the aim of experiment 1 was to examine the effects of
repeated administrations of two different doses of the longlasting opiate antagonist naltrexone, alone or in combination with heroin on the formation of m3g and m6g.
twenty-five rats were separated into six groups. on days
1–10, the rats of the first three groups received daily i.p.
injections of saline or of one of two doses of naltrexone (20
and 40 mg/kg, respectively). at the same time, the rats of
the remaining three groups received ten injections of heroin
(10 mg/kg), given alone or in combination with the two
abovementioned doses of naltrexone. on day 10, at 14:00 h
(i.e., 2 h after the last treatment), all rats were sacrificed to
obtain blood samples for the quantification of heroin, 6monoacetylmorphine (6-mam), morphine, m3g, and m6g
(see below), and their livers were excised to obtain microsomal preparations (see below).
experiment 2
the aim of experiment 2 was to assess the effect of 10-day
exposure to methadone or to ethanol on m3g and m6g
formation in microsomal preparations. twenty-five rats
were separated into five groups. on days 1–10, the rats in
the first four groups received a daily i.p. injection of 1 ml/
kg of saline or one of three doses of methadone (5, 10, and
20 mg/kg, respectively). at the same time, the rats in the
fifth group were given round-the-clock access to a 10%
 xxxd102xxx  as their only source of fluid. on day 10, at
14:00 h, all rats were sacrificed and their livers were
excised to obtain microsomal preparations (see below).
microsomal preparations
liver microsomes were prepared as previously described
(antonilli et al. 2003b). briefly, tissues were minced and
rinsed in ice-cold 1.15% kcl and homogenized in 3 volumes of 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing
0.25 m sucrose. the homogenate was centrifuged for
20 min at 9,000×g. the supernatant was further centrifuged
for 60 min at 105,000×g. the resulting microsomal pellet
was resuspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer containing
0.25 m sucrose to obtain a final protein concentration of
10 mg/ml.

subjects
a total of 59 male sprague–dawley rats (harlan italy,
s. pietro al natisone, italy), weighing 175–200 g upon
arrival, was used in this study. the rats were individually
housed in transparent plastic hanging cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled colony room (lights on from
07:00 to 19:00 h) with ad libitum access to food and water.

glucuronidation assays
the morphine glucuronidation assay was performed as
described by wielbo et al. (1993) under optimal conditions
with respect to time and protein concentration. in detail,
microsomal preparations were suspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) to a final protein concentration of
0.5 mg/ml. microsomes were preincubated for 20 min in

60

0.05%  xxxd1835xxx  at 5°c to achieve full enzymatic
activity. morphine concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 4 mm
for the calculation of m3g kinetics, and from 0.1 to
100 mm for the calculation of m6g kinetics. the incubation mixture consisted of 15 mm udp–glucuronic acid
(udpga), 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), microsomes,
and substrate (morphine) to a final volume of 1 ml. the
reaction was started adding udpga. samples and blanks
(without udpga) were incubated in triplicates at 37°c for
30 min and the reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of acetonitrile and centrifuged. supernatants were then analyzed
using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc).
plasma samples underwent solid phase extraction on
lichrolut tsc (200 mg) columns (merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany) following the procedures described by
wielbo et al. (1993). columns were conditioned with methanol (3 ml) followed by water (3 ml) and phosphate buffer
(0.01 m, ph 3.0). after loading the sample, the column was
washed with 0.01 mm phosphate buffer (ph 3.0) and
methanol. the analytes were eluted with 3 ml of nh4oh
2% in methanol. the eluate was evaporated to dryness at
37°c under a gentle stream of nitrogen. the dry residue
was dissolved in methanol and stored at 4°c until hplc
analysis was performed.
chromatographic analyses were carried out using a hplc
system equipped with automatic sampler (model l-7250),
pump (model l-7100), diode array detector (model l-7455),
and fluorescence detector (model l-7480), all purchased
from merck. data were stored and processed using appropriate software (d-7000 hplc system manager ver.
3.1, hitachi).

activity. in the presence of data satisfying the normality
test, group differences for km, vmax, and hill coefficient
were investigated using one-way anovas. when appropriate, fisher post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons. the km and vmax values in experiment 2 (see
table 3) were analyzed using nonparametric statistics
(kruskal–wallis anova and dunn’s pairwise multiple
comparison procedure) because these data failed the normality test (p=0.004 and p=0.004, respectively). significance level was set at p≤0.05.

drugs
morphine hydrochloride, heroin hydrochloride, 6-mam,
m3g, and methadone were obtained from salars (como,
italy). morphine-6-glucuronide, uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid (udpga), and alamethicin were obtained from
sigma-aldrich (milan, italy). naltrexone hydrochloride
was kindly provided by sirton spa (villaguardia, como,
italy). heroin, naltrexone, and methadone were all administered by i.p. injections at 12:00 h. all solvents were
hplc grade (merck). ethanol was administered as a 10%
solution (v/v) in tap water.
statistical analyses
group differences for plasma levels (mug/ml) of heroin, 6mam, morphine, m3g, and m6g were investigated using
one-way anovas. the saturation curves for the formation
of m3g and m6g by liver microsomes leveled off at the
highest morphine concentrations. km (mm), vmax (nmol/
min/mg protein), and hill coefficient of m3g and m6g
formation were determinated by nonlinear regression analysis. a hill coefficient greater than 1 indicates that an
enzymatic reaction does not follow michaelis–menten kinetics, but there is positive cooperation in the catalytic

results
experiment 1
figure 1 and table 1 illustrate the kinetics of m3g and
m6g formation in microsomal preparations obtained from
rats that had previously received ten daily i.p. injections of
saline, heroin (10 mg/kg), naltrexone (20 or 40 mg/kg), or
heroin (10 mg/kg) + naltrexone (20 or 40 mg/kg). mere
visual inspection of the saturation curves of m3g formation (fig. 1) indicates that this reaction followed michaelis–menten kinetics only in rats treated with saline or
heroin. indeed, the hill coefficients in both saline- and
heroin-treated rats were very close to 1.0 (table 1). in
contrast, naltrexone dose-dependently increased the hill
coefficient [f(5,23)=13.27, p<0.001], suggesting positive
cooperation in this enzymatic reaction. interestingly, coadministration of heroin brought the hill coefficient close
to control values.
as shown in table 1, there were significant group
differences also in vmax [f(5,24)=23.68, p<0.001] and km
[f(5,24)=6.29, p=0.001] for the synthesis of m3g. heroin
given alone reduced the vmax relative to saline (p=0. 05)
without altering the km. in contrast, all groups treated with
naltrexone exhibited higher vmax and km than in the control
and heroin groups, indicating a higher-capacity/lower-affinity enzymatic reaction.
as illustrated in fig. 1 and table 1, m6g was detected
only in microsomal preparations obtained from rats repeatedly exposed to heroin, given either alone or in com-

bination with naltrexone. the km and vmax for the synthesis of m6g indicate a low-affinity/low-capacity enzymatic reaction, with saturation at about 100 mm of
morphine. naltrexone treatment per se did not affect m6g
synthesis, but, when coadministered with heroin, significantly reduced the vmax of m6g formation [f(2,12)=
17.43, p<0.001] without affecting km.
the findings obtained in vitro were in agreement with
the concentrations of morphine, heroin, 6-mam, m3g,
and m6g measured in the plasma samples obtained at the
same time of liver excision (i.e., 2 h after the last treatment). as shown in table 2, m6g was detectable in all
heroin-treated animals. however, m6g and 6-mam levels
[f(2,12)=12.38, p=0.002; f2,12=5.83, p=0.021] were significantly lower in the groups that had received naltrexone
in association with heroin. these groups also exhibited
higher plasma levels of m3g [f(2,12)=8.03, p=0.008].
experiment 2
except for the animals treated with 20 mg/kg of methadone
i.p. (one rat died on the second day and another appeared
severely intoxicated at the moment of sacrifice), all animals
in this experiment remained healthy across the 10 days of
treatment and increased their body weight. as illustrated in
fig. 2, the rats in the ethanol group rapidly stabilized to
a daily intake of ethanol around 5 g/kg [f(8,32)=14.06,
p<0.001].

was somewhat altered by methadone and ethanol as indicated by a significant overall treatment effect for km
(h=12.66, df=4, p=0.01), vmax (h=10.89, df=4, p=0.03),
and hill coefficient [f(4,22)=6.82, p=0.002]. both methadone and ethanol increased the km of m3g formation, but
this effect was significant only in the ethanol group. methadone and ethanol also tended to increase the vmax although there were no significant differences relative to the
saline group. finally, methadone and ethanol also produced
a modest but significant increase in hill coefficient. it is
important to emphasize that the effects of methadone were
not dose-related.

discussion
in the present study, we investigated the effects of heroin,
naltrexone, methadone, and ethanol on morphine glucuronidation in the rat. we report four major findings. first,

repeated administrations of heroin reduced the synthesis of
m3g, the main metabolite of morphine. second, and most
important, repeated heroin administration induced the synthesis of m6g, the active metabolite of morphine that is
usually undetectable in the rat (milne et al. 1996). third,
these effects of heroin did not appear to depend on the
activity of mor. indeed, as discussed in detail below, the
complex effects of the mor antagonist naltrexone on morphine glucuronidation are not easily reconciled with its
ability to block mor. furthermore, repeated administrations of high doses of methadone, a full mor agonist,
failed to mimic the effects of heroin on either m3g or m6g
synthesis. fourth, chronic exposure to alcohol increased
m3g synthesis, but had no effects on m6g synthesis.
the effects of heroin reported here confirm and expand
the findings of an earlier study (antonilli et al. 2003b). in
particular, we confirmed that vmax of m3g synthesis by
liver microsomal preparations from rats repeatedly treated
with heroin was lower than that obtained from salineinjected rats. in the present study, we found that the hill
coefficient for the synthesis of m3g was about 1 in both
the saline and heroin groups, indicating that the reaction
followed michaelis–menten kinetics. therefore, the reduction of m3g synthesis induced by heroin was probably
due to a reduction in the number of ugt molecules and not
to changes in their enzymatic activity. we also confirmed
that the microsomes obtained from heroin-treated rats
yield, when incubated with morphine, measurable levels of
m6g. in contrast, m6g was undetectable in all other
treatment groups. the increased synthesis of m6g was
coupled with a hill coefficient around 1 and a very low
vmax. thus, heroin appears to induce an enzymatic system
that in the rat is normally quiescent (milne et al. 1996). in
our experimental conditions, capacity of this enzymatic system is low, and further studies will need to assess whether
this is an intrinsic property of the enzyme or because heroin
is a weak inducer.

63

surprisingly, the synthesis of m3g under naltrexone did
not follow michaelis–menten kinetics. indeed, naltrexone
induced a dose-dependent increase in the hill coefficient
(which was about 2 for the rats repeatedly treated with
40 mg/kg naltrexone). furthermore, naltrexone dose-dependently increased the rate of m3g synthesis, as indicated
by an increase in vmax, relative to the saline and the heroin
groups. naltrexone also increased the km of m3g formation. in summary, m3g synthesis in the naltrexone groups,
contrary to the saline and the heroin groups, exhibited positive cooperative activity with higher capacity and lower
affinity for the substrate (i.e., for morphine) relative to the
control and heroin condition. in contrast, naltrexone had no
measurable effect on the synthesis of m6g, which was
undetectable.
it is important to emphasize that the results obtained
using microsomal preparations are in agreement with the ex
vivo data concerning plasma levels of morphine and its
metabolites. we have previously found detectable plasma
levels of m6g in rats treated with repeated heroin, but not
with acute heroin, acute morphine, or repeated morphine
(antonilli et al. 2003b). furthermore, rats administered
with repeated heroin exhibited lower plasma levels of m3g
than rats treated with acute heroin, acute morphine, or
repeated morphine. in the present study, we confirm that
repeated heroin administration induces detectable plasma
levels of m6g. interestingly, rats that received heroin in
combination with naltrexone showed higher plasma levels
of m3g relative to rats treated with heroin alone. moreover, naltrexone reduced plasma levels of m6g as well as
of 6-mam, without affecting those of morphine. the reason why naltrexone differently affects plasma concentrations of heroin metabolites is not clear. however, it has been
already observed that acute coadministration of naltrexone
influences morphine distribution in the rats (bhargava et al.
1993). this suggests that naltrexone can affect heroin pharmacokinetics in other ways than via changes in hepatic
metabolism.
what can account for the ability of both heroin and
naltrexone to alter morphine glucuronidation albeit in different ways? one possibility is that these effects are related
to the phenantrenic structure of these two drugs. for example, it has been reported that some analogues of phenanthrene can selectively induce ugt activity in the rat
liver, increasing morphine glucuronidation up to fivefold
(franklin et al. 1993). furthermore, we have recently found
that both naltrexone and heroin can reduce the glucuronidation of estradiol to estradiol-3-glucuronide, without
affecting the synthesis of estradiol-17-glucuronide (manuscript in preparation). a systematic investigation of structure–activity relationships would be required to test the
hypothesis that different substitutions on the planar structure of phenanthrene can differentially alter the activity of
various ugts.
the notion of independent effects of heroin and naltrexone on the synthesis of m3g may also help explaining
the complex nature of their interaction. indeed, the kinetics
of m3g synthesis in the heroin + naltrexone groups was
only partly similar to that observed in naltrexone groups. in

particular, the hill coefficient in the naltrexone + heroin
group, contrary to that of naltrexone group, was not different from either the saline or the heroin groups. heroin
and naltrexone also appeared to interact in the synthesis
of m6g, with a reduced vmax in the heroin + naltrexone
groups relative to the heroin groups. this phenomenon was
probably a mere consequence of the increased synthesis of
m3g in the naltrexone groups, because the two reactions of
glucuronidation are mutually exclusive.
the findings discussed above make it quite unlikely that
the effects of heroin on morphine glucuronidation depend
on the repeated activation of mor. this conclusion is
further strengthened by the fact that the effects of heroin on
morphine metabolism are not shared by other mor agonists. we have previously found that repeated administrations of medium to high doses of morphine has little or no
effect on the synthesis of m3g and m6g (antonilli et al.
2003b). we now report that also repeated administrations
of high doses of methadone fail to mimic the effects of
heroin on morphine glucuronidation. the only effect of
methadone was to produce a nonsignificant increase in the
vmax and km for the synthesis of m3g. the mechanisms
implicated in this effect are not clear. to the best of our
knowledge, there are no reports on the ability of methadone
to induce drug glucuronidation. in contrast, there is evidence that in vivo administration of methadone can inhibit
the glucuronidation of at least one drug. methadone maintenance treatment has been found in fact to increase plasma
concentrations of zidovudine in heroin addicts treated for
hiv infection (schwartz et al. 1992). furthermore, methadone concentrations well above the therapeutic range have
been reported to inhibit zidovudine glucuronidation in
human microsomal preparations (trapnell et al. 1998).
also chronic exposure to 10% ethanol had relatively
little effect on morphine glucuronidation. it is well known
that alcohol can enhance the drug metabolism depending
on the activity of the  xxxg589xxx  enzymes (klotz and ammon
1998). in contrast, very little has been published on the
effects of ethanol on morphine glucuronidation. narayan
et al. (1991), for example, have reported that rabbits exposed to 10% ethanol for 2 weeks and then injected with
morphine exhibited a 72% increase in the ratio of the
glucuronide/morphine aucs. in agreement with these
earlier report, we found here that 10-day exposure to 10%
ethanol increases the vmax of m3g synthesis, albeit this
effect did not reach statistical significance. ethanol had no
effect on the synthesis of m6g.
in summary, the results reported here indicate that heroin
has a unique effect on morphine metabolism in the rat,
reducing the synthesis of the inactive metabolite m3g
while inducing the synthesis of the active metabolite m6g.
morphine, as well as a number of substances that are
known to play an important role in the natural history of
heroin addiction, failed to mimic these effects of heroin. in
particular, we have shown that naltrexone, methadone, and
alcohol can increase the synthesis of m3g and have no
effect on the synthesis of m6g. furthermore, in an earlier
study, we found that cadmium, a contaminant of street
heroin (infante et al. 1999), can reduce the synthesis of

64

m3g, but has no effect on that of m6g, indicating that the
two effects are dissociable.
taken together, our findings suggest that the reduced
m3g levels and increased m6g levels we have previously
found in the plasma of heroin addicts (antonilli et al.
2003a; von euler et al. 2003) were probably the consequence the repeated exposure has to heroin itself. of
course, many aspects of the effects of heroin on morphine
glucuronidation remain to be elucidated. for example, it
would be important to determine the exact nature of the
enzymes responsible for the altered synthesis of m3g and
m6g. indeed, we are currently in the process of purifying
and sequencing these enzymes.
the ability of heroin to enhance m6g synthesis may
have important clinical implications because m6g is a
potent opioid agonist (ulens et al. 2001) and can accumulate in the cns (lotsch and geisslinger 2001; klepstad
et al. 2000). an increased production of m6g in chronic
heroin users, for example, may lead to a more prolonged
effects of each single exposure to heroin, thereby increasing its habit-forming properties. increased m6g levels in
heroin addicts may also be implicated in the elusive pathogenesis of heroin overdose (fugelstad et al. 2003). one
way to address these hypotheses would be to block the
effects of heroin on morphine glucuronidation without altering its effects at mor receptors. presently, this goal
cannot be pursued because pharmacological tools possessing such selective action are not available. yet, development of selective inhibitors of morphine glucuronidation
seems possible taking into account that this enzymatic
process can be pharmacologically manipulated.
