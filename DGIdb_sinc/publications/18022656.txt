average by about 1.5 kj/mol, corresponding to an almost doubling of the binding afﬁnity.

introduction

because of their ability to exert intense biological effects in
almost any organ, corticosteroids are one of the most widely
used drug classes [1–3]. they are commonly utilized in a
variety of clinical diseases and are even the drug of choice
and the mainstay of therapy in many of them, mainly due
to their potent antiinﬂammatory and immunosuppressive
effects [1,4,5]. despite the long and widespread use of glucocorticoids and the considerable time since the concept of

steroid  xxxg1603xxx  action was laid down [6], the molecular mechanism of their action(s) started to emerge only in
the last 20 years [7–9]. these steroids exert their main effect
by binding to glucocorticoid receptors (grs), a member of
the steroid–thyroid–retinoid receptor super-family [10,11]. not
surprisingly, gr, together with the  xxxg1078xxx , are
the target with the most number of drugs approved [12]. grs
are predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of target cells
and move into the nuclear compartment only on binding of the
glucocorticoid. the crystal structure of the human gr ligand-

194

s t e r o i d s 7 3 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 193–208

binding domain (lbd) bound to dexamethasone as well as
mifepristone ( xxxd2643xxx ) has been determined by using receptors
with single point mutations (e.g., f602 s,  xxxd2587xxx  d) [13,14]. it should
be mentioned that even if steroids exert their main action via
binding to these hormone receptors that regulate the expression of corticosteroid-responsive genes, there is increasing
evidence that corticosteroids can exert non-genomic effects as
well [15–17]. there also seems to be a physical and functional
interaction between the  xxxg1601xxx  and the t-cell
receptor complex underlying the non-genomic glucocorticoidinduced immunosuppression in t cells [18]. a number of
structural requirements for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activities are now commonly accepted [1]. some of the
more important ones are summarized in fig. 1 together with
the common numbering and notation system of these structures; more detailed reviews have been published recently
[2,3].

the therapeutic potential of a compound is a function
of various properties determining both the efﬁcacy of the
stimulus–response mechanism [19] and the overall absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (adme) behavior,
with receptor-binding afﬁnity (rba) being, in general, a major
determinant. for corticosteroids, it is even more so, because
grs from different tissues and even from different species
seem to be essentially the same; consequently, relative rbas
(rrbas; usually expressed as percent values with dexamethasone as reference) are commonly used as a measure of
potency. there are also indications that ligand rba inﬂuences
even gr molecular mechanisms, for example, it alters gr
mobility in living cells [20]. indeed, for corticosteroids, various in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties tend to
correlate closely with rba [21]; e.g., rba has been shown to
be related to the clinical efﬁcacy of inhaled glucocorticoids
[22], to side-effects such as cortisol suppression [23,24], or

to immunosuppressive potency [25]. accordingly, for example, for inhaled corticosteroids [26], average recommended
daily doses are closely correlated with rrba (fig. 2a); the
only exception being  xxxd294xxx  (bdp, 8),
which, however, is a prodrug and has to be transformed into
the active 17␣-monopropionate (bmp) form. as customary
in quantitative structure–activity relationship (qsar) studies,
the logarithm of the inverse of the dose (log 1/d) is represented
as a function of the log rrba values.
unfortunately, because of the intrinsic multiple activities of steroids and because of the ubiquitous distribution
of the corticosteroid receptors, unwanted side-effects tend
to closely parallel therapeutic effectiveness. systemic sideeffects, which typically include myopathy, osteoporosis,
hypertension, insulin resistance, weight gain, fat redistribution, increased intraocular pressure, growth inhibition, and
others in a dose-dependent manner [27–32], still seriously
limit the application of glucocorticoids. with the introduction of newer inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids, at least
the therapeutic index of this class increased signiﬁcantly:
whereas local activity and clinical efﬁcacy were preserved
or enhanced, most of the serious and immediately apparent
side-effects were virtually eliminated [33]. for most of these
compounds, the risk of serious adverse events (sae) is also relatively low; for example, for inhaled budesonide, the incidence
of reported saes is 1 event per 100,000 patient years [34]. nevertheless, even inhaled corticosteroids are often underused
because of concerns about side-effects, including possible
local side-effects, such as oral candidiasis or dysphonia [35],
and in a few cases, even severe systemic side-effects have been
seen especially when co-administered with cyp3a4 inhibitors
[30,36–39]. because most of these potential adverse effects
usually arise only following long-term treatment, clinical
studies of corticosteroids in the development phase monitor
suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis
as a surrogate marker. cortisol (hydrocortisone) suppression

is also closely rrba-related as fig. 2b showing the estimated
daily doses causing 10% and 20% auc cortisol suppression
clearly illustrates (data are for mdi formulations except for
bud, which is for dpi [40]).
here, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of gr rrba
data from more than a hundred steroid structures is presented. because of a clear biphasic (bilinear) dependence on
molecular size (i.e., calculated molecular volume v), a nonlinear analysis is needed, and the recently introduced linearized
biexponential (linbiexp) model [41,42] provided good ﬁt, just
as it did for anticholinergic binding at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors [43]. linbiexp can ﬁt any bilinear-type data,
i.e., data that show a maximum, a minimum, or just a ratechange around a given parameter value, but tend to show good
linearity away from this. it uses a novel functional form [41,42]
consisting of the logarithm of the sum of two exponentials to
obtain a bilinear functionality:
y = f (x) =  ln[e˛1 (x−c )/ + e˛2 (x−c )/ ] + 

(1)

even if the mathematical form of the model seems at ﬁrst
sight somewhat complex, it relies on a set of intuitive, easily interpretable parameters (denoted with greek symbols):
two slopes (˛1 and ˛2 ) corresponding to the two linear segments, a constant () for shifting along the y (vertical) axis, a
constant ( c ) for shifting along the x (horizontal) axis (i.e., to
position the rate-change point), and a parameter () for adjusting the smoothness/abruptness of the transition between the
two linear portions. in addition, if needed, speciﬁc effects due
to the presence of certain structural functions and/or moieties (ϕ) can be accounted for through the use of indicator
variables (iϕ , which are 1 if ϕ is present and 0 otherwise) by
addition of ıϕ ·iϕ terms to the above equation so that ıϕ corresponds to the average change in y due to the presence of ϕ
[41,43].

experimental

glucocorticoid relative receptor-binding afﬁnity data (rrba),
were collected from literature [23,24,44–64]; they were
determined using standard methodology. experimental
gr-binding afﬁnities are typically obtained with rat cytosol
preparations by determining the concentration (ic50 ) necessary to inhibit by 50% the binding of a given concentration of
3 h-dexamethasone as radioligand (l* ). the corresponding k
d
dissociation constants, kd = [r][d]/[rd], for the receptor–drug
(rd) binding, r + d ↔ rd, are then obtained with the
∗ ).
cheng–prusoff equation [65] as kd = 1/ka = ic50 /(1 + [l* ]0 /kd
depending on the assay, the binding afﬁnity of dexamethasone itself is usually somewhere in the range of 2–12 nm;
here we will use a value of 6.6 nm, the average of available
literature data [44,45,47,56,66–71]. to allow comparison of
receptor-binding data obtained under different conditions,
they were all expressed as percent values relative to dexamethasone (rrbadex = 100%) following standard practice.
whenever multiple rrbas were available for a single compound, their average has been used; for each compound,
corresponding references are shown in table 1 . all values
were then converted to change in standard free energy (g0 )
values compared to the reference dexamethasone using
g0 = rt0 ln kd,dex /kd = rt0 ln 10 log rrba = 5.708 log rrba
(kj) and a value of kd,dex = 6.6 nm corresponding to
g0dex = −46.70 kj/mol for dexamethasone. estimated kd
0
values (nm) recalculated from these averages (kd = eg /rt0 )
are also shown in table 1 for all compounds to provide a more
intuitive binding afﬁnity scale. all structures that have g0
and kd values shown in table 1 have been used for the qsar
study except for the four antiprogestins included for illustration only (their values are shown in parenthesis). some
compounds with low binding have been omitted, a likely
reason for their inactivity is shown as a comment. binding
data from [46] seemed lower than from most comparable
other studies; some of these series have been omitted.
molecular structures were built and optimized in chemdraw/chem3d (chemofﬁce ultra 7.0; cambridgesoft, cambridge, ma), and molecular weight, volumes, surface areas,
and other descriptors were calculated and compiled with
an extension of the qlogp program as described previously
[43,72–74]. for lipophilicity estimates, log octanol–water partition coefﬁcients (log po/w ) were obtained as a consensus
estimate (average) of three methods: qlogp, clogp (chemdraw ultra 7.0, cambridgesoft, cambridge, massachusetts,
usa), and acd/logp (advanced chemistry development,
toronto, ontario, canada); this has been found to provide quite reliable estimates. wherever available, cas
numbers are also shown in table 1. for fig. 4, structure 1m2z [13] was obtained from rcsb’s protein data
bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbid=1m2z),
and the image was generated with ds visualizer 1.7 (accelrys,
inc., san diego, ca). glucocorticoid structures were individually optimized using am1 [75] semiempirical quantum
chemical methods, and ring-fusion carbon atoms (c5 , c8 , c9 ,
c10 , c13 , c14 ) were used to generate an overlapping structure, which was then superimposed on dexamethasone in the
above crystal structure of the human glucocorticoid ligand-

binding domain. the receptor structure is covered with a van
der waals surface; however, the amino acids in front of the
ligand structure are shown as line structures only for better
visibility.
nonlinear ﬁttings required for linbiexp were performed
using custom-built models in winnonlin professional 5.0
(pharsight corp., mountain view, ca) as described previously
[41,42]. the gauss–newton (levenberg and hartley) minimization algorithm was used with the convergence criteria set
to 0.00001, the increment for partial derivatives set to 0.001,
and the number of iterations set to 50. user-provided initial parameter estimates and software-provided bounds were
used. statistical analyses were performed using a standard
spreadsheet program (microsoft excel 2003).

results

steroid relative receptor-binding afﬁnity (rrba) data at the
gr were collected for more than 150 structures (table 1), and
104 of these were actually used for the qsar analysis; those
omitted were inactive compounds that usually did not satisfy
some known structural requirements of gr-binding (a corresponding footnote in table 1 indicates the likely reason for
inactivity for the omitted compounds). in this sense, these
data can be considered as representing a sort of upper limit of
binding obtainable for a given ligand size. as fig. 3 indicates,
data can be divided roughly into two categories: a set of more
active halogen and/or acetal-substituted steroid compounds
and a set of unsubstituted compounds (data are shown with a
reversed vertical axis so that the more active compounds that
have lower g0 values are at the top of the ﬁgure in agreement
with standard qsar practice). there is also clear evidence for
a biphasic dependence on molecular size: for smaller compounds, activity increases with increasing size, but there is
a turning point and for larger compounds, activity decreases
with increasing size. such data may be well suited for bilinear
ﬁtting [41–43], and the overall adequacy of a bilinear model for
the gr-binding data is strongly supported by the very close
similarity between the shape of the bilinear (linbiexp) ﬁt and
that of the smoothed average obtained for the more active
subset, where there are a more adequate number of data on
both sides of the curve (fig. 3). hence, this model will be used
for further ﬁttings with molecular size (volume) as the independent variable (x = v) in the following form that can also
account for various substitution effects (ϕi , i = 1, . . ., n) through
the incorporation of indicator variables, iϕi :
g0 (kj/mol) = rt0 ln kd
=  ln[e˛1 (v−c )/ + e˛2 (v−c )/ ] +  +

as suggested by this equation, as a ﬁrst try, one can use
 = 2.48 (i.e., rt0 in kj/mol) and ﬁt all halogen- and acetonideunsubstituted structures without using any indicators (i.e.,
n = 0 meaning no ıϕ iϕ terms,). this results in model 1 (table 2)
with a well-deﬁned ﬁrst and a somewhat uncertain second
slope (˛1 = −0.110 ± 0.024 , ˛2 = 0.074 ± 0.044 ), and a quite good
overall ﬁt that accounts for about 60% of the variability
(r2 = 0.59). fit of all substituted compounds with the same

notes: see fig. 1 for general structure and position of substituents (1,2 , x6 , x9 , x16 , r␣ , r␤ ). log pcalc is average of three calculated values (qlogp, clogp, and acd/logp). rrba is relative receptor-binding afﬁnity from literature data (see
ref. rrba column) calculated as percent compared to dexamethasone (rrbadex = 100%) following standard practice; these were converted to kd and g0 values using kd,dex = 6.6 nm. remark indicates a likely reason for the low gr-binding
activity of compounds omitted from the regression.

equation results in the well-deﬁned model 2 (table 2), which
except for a vertical shift, is quite similar to model 1 (i.e., the
slopes and the turning points are not very different) and also
to the smoothed average of the data obtained by a negative
exponential smoothing; hence, the bilinear model provides an
adequate basis for further analysis.
it has been long known that rba is dramatically increased
by 6␣- or 9␣-halogenation (mainly ﬂuorination) [44] and by
introduction of cyclic 16,17-acetal moieties; these substituent
effects are analyzed in detail here. for halogenations, a ﬁrst
substitution at the 6␣- or 9␣-position seems to cause about
the same activity increase, whereas the second one seems
to cause some increase, but far less than the close to 10-fold
one caused by the ﬁrst substitution. if separate indicators are
used for 6␣- only, 9␣- only, and 6&9␣-halogenation in cyclic
acetal non-containing compounds (i6f,only , i9f,only , i6&9f,only )
in the linbiexp model (model 3, table 2), the corresponding changes in the associated g0 (or log rrba) are very
similar for the ﬁrst halogenations: ı6f,only = −4.64(±0.77) and
ı9f,only = −4.60(±0.47) (kj/mol) and not very different if both
positions are halogenated ı6&9f,only = −5.95(±0.83) . furthermore,
approximately the same change seems to be caused by the
presence of a cyclic 16,17-acetal moiety in nonhalogenated
compounds (in addition to the corresponding size-related
effects) (ıactl,only = −4.22(±0.99) kj/mol) (model 3, table 2), but it
has almost no or even a detrimental effect in already halogenated compounds (ıhal& xxxg35xxx  = +0.94(±0.91) ). except for this last
value, all coefﬁcients are statistically well-deﬁned (with coefﬁcients of variations that are all below 25%) indicating that the
corresponding structural modiﬁcations produce quite consistent effects on binding.
these results (model 3, table 2) clearly show that, on
one hand, the beneﬁcial effects of a ﬁrst 6␣-halogen, 9␣halogen, or cyclic 16,17-acetal substitutions are about the
same (ı6f,only ≈ ␦9f,only ≈ ıactl,only ≈ −4.5 kj/mol, corresponding
to an approximately 6- to 7-fold increase in receptor afﬁnity;
i.e., 104.5/5.708 = 6.14), and, on the other hand, a halogenation
in an already halogenated or a cyclic acetal-containing compound causes only minimal improvement over the ﬁrst one
(e.g., in double-ﬂuorinated compounds, where the change
should be ı6f,only + ı9f,only = −9.24 with additive effects, it is only
−5.95). hence, from an activity point of view, steroid structures seem to be divisible in two groups only by use of a
single indicator: those that are substituted with a 6␣- or 9␣halogen or cyclic 16,17-acetal moiety (ihal/ xxxg35xxx  = 1) and those
that are not (ihal/ xxxg35xxx  = 0). if separate indicators are used for
6␣- or 9␣-halogenation (ihal ) and the presence of cyclic 16,17acetal moiety (iactl ), not only are the corresponding changes
in the associated g0 very similar (ıhal = −4.71(±0.44) and
ıactl = −4.15(±0.99) ), but when both are present (ihal& xxxg35xxx  = = 1),
one of the effects is practically cancelled (ıhal& xxxg35xxx  = +4.51(±1.24) )
(model 4, table 2).
a no beneﬁcial effect of halogenation in cyclic 16,17acetal-containing compounds has already been noted in
budesonide analogs more than 20 years ago [45]. a comparison of speciﬁc pairs that differ only in a single substitution,
such as, for example, hydrocortisone-9␣f vs. hydrocortisone

prednisolone acetonide (g0 = −0.51 kj/mol) for the effect

binding (g = rt ln kd ) shown as a function of calculated molecular size (molecular volume, v) and ﬁtted with the linbiexp
bilinear model. because inactive corticosteroids that lack various pharmacophores required for binding at gr were not
included, this set represents a sort of upper limit of binding at this receptor. 6␣- or 9␣-halogenated (mostly ﬂuorinated) or
cyclic 16,17-acetal-containing highly active structures are denoted separately with closed symbols; four antiprogestins with
a somewhat different structural framework that were not used for ﬁtting are shown as dashed symbols. the dashed brown
line shows the smoothed average of the more active subset (negative exponential 2d smooth method with a sampling
proportion of 0.5 from sigmaplot 2002; spss inc, chicago, il, usa); it is included to illustrate the adequacy of the linbiexp
bilinear model for ﬁtting these data.

substituted compound, respectively, gives statistically much
less well-deﬁned values (as there are only relatively low
numbers of exact pairs), but essentially supports these observations (see table 3 for the mean ± s.d. value of all such
possible pairings with available data). according to these pair
comparisons, ﬂuorination at the 6␣ and 9␣ positions changes
the free energy of binding by −3.76±0.23 kj/mol (n = 2) and
−6.12±2.22 kj/mol (n = 4), respectively, if it is the ﬁrst ﬂuorination; whereas, it changes the free energy of binding by
only −1.41±1.06 kj/mol (n = 5) and −0.36±0.51 kj/mol (n = 2) if it is
the second ﬂuorination in an already ﬂuorinated compound,
and by + 0.71 kj/mol (n = 1) and + 0.16±0.95 kj/mol (n = 2) if it is
in an already cyclic 16,17-acetal-substituted compound (in all
these cases, the size-related effects are small as f is only
slightly larger than h, v ≈ 4–5 å3 ). this is somewhat surprising because 6␣- or 9␣-ﬂuorination (halogenation) is usually
considered as activity enhancing for any structure, and there
were even studies on antiinﬂammatory activity indicating
not just additive, but even synergistic effects for this pair of
substituents [76]. from the same comparison (table 3), introduction of a cyclic 16,17-acetal substitution changes the free
energy of binding by −10.64 kj/mol (n = 1) if it is in an unﬂuorinated compound; whereas, it changes the free energy of
binding by only −4.55±2.65 kj/mol (n = 3) if it is in an already
ﬂuorinated compound. in this case, there is also a size-related
effect as the substituent is quite large (v ≈ 35 å3 ); to obtain a
value comparable to the ı values of the linbiexp-based models
(models 3–6), one has to subtract the correspond free energy
change (∼0.10 v) resulting in values of −7.12 kj/mol (n = 1) and

−1.08±2.65 kj/mol (n = 3) for unﬂuorinated and already ﬂuorinated compounds, respectively.
considering all these, a single indicator variable (ihal/ xxxg35xxx  )
was used in the ﬁnal bilinear model to avoid overparametrization, resulting in model 5 (table 2). this model with only two
descriptors (v, ihal/ xxxg35xxx  ) and ﬁve adjustable parameters (˛1 , ˛2 ,
, c , ıhal/ xxxg35xxx  ) is statistically very well-deﬁned and accounts
for 76% of the variance in the gr-binding data of 104 compounds. in all these equations,  = 2.48 was assumed for the
value of the constant regulating the smoothness (width) of the
transition between the two linear segments simply because
of the proportionality between g0 and ln k (eq. (2)) [41]. the
corresponding width of the curved transition section, which
depends on  and is approximately 1.7/(˛1 − ˛2 ), agrees well
with the data being maybe slightly larger than suggested by
the overall trend of the data (fig. 3). if the restriction on 
is released, a somewhat better ﬁt is obtained with a smaller
value ( = 0.241±2.159 , corresponding to a more abrupt transition) (model 6). however, this value is not well-deﬁned, and
the obtained improvement in the quality of ﬁt does not justify the increase in the number of parameters according to
most model selection criteria used to judge the adequacy of
such models. the akaike information criterion (aic) indicates
model 6 with released  as somewhat more adequate, but the
more stringent schwarz–bayesian information criterion (sbic)
and the f-statistics (p = 0.06) indicate the more parsimonious
model 5 with ﬁxed  as somewhat more adequate (the more
adequate model has lower aic and sbic values on the same
dataset [41,42]).

discussion

a large number of gr rrba data were collected and assembled as g0 data for qsar analysis. to provide a set of more
0
intuitive binding data, corresponding kd values (kd = eg /rt0 )
are also shown (table 1). compounds considered for the
present quantitative analysis show good binding and satisfy
all main binding criteria at the gr; therefore, the average of
their dissociation constants, ∼17 nm, is in good agreement
with the median afﬁnity for current small-molecule drugs,
which was found to be quite high, around 20 nm in a recent
study of all binding afﬁnity-related endpoints of all identiﬁable drug-efﬁcacy target pairs (i.e., ic50 , ec50 , ed50 , ki , kd ,
and pa2 ) found [12]. the estimated average gr-binding afﬁnity of hydrocortisone (cortisol, 1) is about 70 nm (table 1);
a reasonable value within the normal plasma concentration range of cortisol. normal human plasma cortisol levels
ﬂuctuate between approx. one hundred and 800 nm (being
higher in the morning); however, free cortisol represents only
about 5% of the total (i.e., 5–40 nm) as 80–90% is bound to
corticosteroid-binding globulin (cbg or transcortin) and the
remainder is associated with albumin [77]. cbg is a transport/cargo glycoprotein that binds biologically active steroids
with considerably higher afﬁnity and speciﬁcity than other
plasma proteins [78]. cbg binding data have been frequently
used as a steroid “benchmark” binding data for qsar studies
[79–81], but it has to be noted that there seems to be no close
correlation between cbg binding and gr-binding, which is the
subject of the present analysis.
with the present bilinear model (models 5 and 6), two
structure-based descriptors, calculated molecular volume,
v, and an indicator variable, ihal/ xxxg35xxx  , for activity-enhancing
substitutions (6␣- or 9␣-ﬂuorination or cyclic 16,17-acetal substitution), account for about 80% of the variability in the
binding data of more than 100 steroid structures. activity
shows a biphasic dependence on size with maximal afﬁnity
occurring for steroids close to an ideal size, which is similar
to those of most highly active steroids. there have been a few
previous studies on corticosteroid binding [44,46,55] or activity
[76,82,83], mainly using lipophilicity (e.g., log po/w ) as descriptor; compared to these, the present study not only uses a much
larger number of data, but also has the additional advantage
that (1) it maintains the intuitivity and easy interpretability
of linear approaches, while still accounting for the nonlinearity of the data through the linbiexp model, and that (2) all
of its descriptors are entirely structure-derived. one has to
remember that because size and lipophilicity are closely correlated [84] (especially on related structures), lipophilicity and
size (volume) can give similar performances; nevertheless,
volume gave a much better ﬁt with the bilinear model here
than did lipophilicity (log po/w ). a strong size-dependency of
the rba at the gr has been shown previously using calculated
molecular volume (n = 38, 57) [41,57] or connolly surface area
(coar, n = 11) [55]. mager and jusko found a linear increase
with size (coar) [55]; however, they considered only eleven
compounds that were all on the rising side of the biphasic
curve as ﬂuticasone propionate was the largest compound
included in their study, and they did not discriminate among
ﬂuorinated and non-ﬂuorinated compounds. nevertheless,

the rightmost column uses an approximate volume correction (g0 + 0.1v) to obtain values that are comparable to the ı terms obtained in
the linbiexp regression equations (table 2).

the size-dependency they found still agrees sufﬁciently well
with the one found here for small-enough compounds: the
slope they found, 0.027 for log rrba as a function of coar,
can be converted to the scale used here (g0 as a function of
v) due to the close correlation between the two measures of
molecular size (coar = 1.065v + 15.502, r2 = 0.976, n = 11), and
it corresponds to a slope of −5.708 × 1.065 × 0.027 = −0.146,
which is somewhat larger but not very different than the
˛1 = −0.114±0.012 obtained here (model 5).
at ﬁrst sight, it might seem somewhat surprising that a
nonspeciﬁc parameter such as size can account for such a
large proportion of the binding afﬁnity as one would expect
more speciﬁc, pharmacophore-related effects; however, the
compounds included in the present study already satisfy the
main structural requirements of binding at the gr, and they
already contain the essentials pharmacophores required for
adequate binding [1,57]. therefore, this set probably represents a sort of upper limit of binding; inactive steroids lacking
various required pharmacophores were omitted. the ﬁrst
crystal structure of the human gr ligand-binding domain
(lbd) bound to dexamethasone determined by using a receptor with a single point mutation (f602 s) [13] is in excellent
agreement with the observations of the present qsar study.
gr seems to have an additional branch, compared to the
steroid-shaped pocket of androgen-, estrogen-, or progestinreceptors, and can accommodate the larger 17␣ substituents
of glucocorticoids that are not present in testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone [11,13]. unspeciﬁc (van der waals-type)
interactions within the surprisingly large 17-positioned side
pocket of gr, where most of the ligands’ structural variations
are (fig. 4), could be responsible for a good portion of the
g0 (rrba) variation seen, and they could indeed be mainly
size-dependent. an overlap of representative, highly active
glucocorticoid structures within the lbd of the human gr
generated using the crystal structure complexed with dexamethasone [13] illustrates well this point: even the largest
structure ( xxxd1690xxx  active metabolite) encounters only minimal structural bumps even though the structure of the

fig. 4 – overlap of representative, highly active
glucocorticoid structures within the ligand-binding domain
of the human gr generated using the crystal structure
complexed with dexamethasone [13]. included steroid
structures are as follows:  xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx  monopropionate:
orange, 22r budesonide (4): brown,  xxxd1690xxx  active
metabolite: purple,  xxxd1719xxx : green, dexamethasone:
black, ﬂuticasone propionate (7): blue,  xxxd2665xxx 
(8): red. note that even the largest structure ( xxxd1690xxx 
active metabolite) encounters only minimal structural
bumps (dashed yellow lines around its 16,17␣ cyclohexyl
substituent in the lower right corner). (for interpretation of
the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is
referred to the web version of the article.)

binding pocket was obtained with the much smaller dexamethasone as ligand (fig. 4). proteins are ﬂexible structures in
constant motion between different states of similar energies;
hence, binding site shape and size is, at least to some extent,
determined by the ligand [85], and the larger ligands almost
certainly ﬁt even better than indicated by this ﬁgure especially that the lbd of gr has been shown to be particularly

204

s t e r o i d s 7 3 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 193–208

ﬂexible [14], and other members of this receptor super-family
also show unique plasticity (e.g., serm binding at estrogen
receptors [86]).
as long as the substituents are not prohibitively
large, increasing size tends to result in increasing
binding. for the gr, optimum receptor binding is
predicted to occur somewhere around vmax = c − 
[ln(˛1 ) − ln(−˛2 )]/(˛1 − ˛2 ) = 361.0 å3 , and seems to be about the
same in substituted and unsubstituted compounds (table 2
and fig. 3). this value is very close to those of highly active
steroids such as  xxxd1719xxx  propionate (6; 349.9), ﬂuticasone
propionate (7; 357.8), or  xxxd2665xxx  (8; 367.9).
dexamethasone, which was observed to occupy only part of
the volume of the overall gr steroid pocket, but still have
nearly every atom of its steroid core in contact with one
or more hydrophobic residue of gr in addition to speciﬁc
protein–ligand hydrogen bonds at all hydrophilic moieties
(e.g., at the c3 ketone, at the 11␤-, 17␣-, and 21-hydroxyl)
[13], indeed has a considerably smaller volume (298.0 å3 ).
obviously, overall size is not a perfect descriptor, and, for
example, size-limitations are certainly not the same in all
regions of the lbd of gr (e.g., they are probably more stringent
at the 17␤ than at the 17␣ side chain), and this is probably
why the larger compounds are much more scattered from a
linear ﬁt than the smaller ones. most substituted 17␤ esters,
such as  xxxd294xxx  (9) or  xxxd1690xxx  (10),
are inactive, but can be activated by hydrolytic cleavage of the
ester moiety.
such a biphasic behavior of binding afﬁnity on ligand size
may be present in many other receptor classes as well; for
example, recently we showed evidence for a similar behavior
in quaternary anticholinergics [43]. for small-enough corticosteroids that contain all necessary pharmacophores, the
size-dependency of the free energy of binding (slope of approx.
0.1 kj/mol/å3 ) obtained here suggest that, as long as only
nonspeciﬁc interactions are involved, addition of a methylenesized non-hydrogen atom to the ligand structure, which with
the algorithm used here increases the volume by 14–16 å3 ,
increases the absolute value of the free energy of binding on
average by about 1.5 kj/mol, corresponding to an almost doubling of the binding afﬁnity (101.5/5.708 = 1.83). this is somewhat
less than some earlier general estimates for ligand–receptor
binding (e.g., 3–6 kj/mol/atom [66,87]), but it is quite reasonable
as here, it only represent increases due to nonspeciﬁc interactions, whereas, in the general cases, size also incorporates
a term due to speciﬁc interactions (and/or other interceptrelated assumptions) [66,87,88]. this value is also in excellent
agreement with the average binding increment seen for 18
highly optimized inhibitors at ﬁve different protein targets in
fragment-based drug discovery [89]. this found that a 10-fold
increase in binding (i.e., a one unit change in pkd or log kd )
requires an average increase of about 64 in mw [89]; hence, the
1.8-fold increase seen here for addition of a non-h atom would
require an increase of about 64 × log 1.8 ≈ 16 in mw, about the
mass of a methylene-sized unit.
regarding the halogenation effects, an activity-enhancing
effect for ﬂuorination has been long known for glucocorticoids. one of the earliest detailed thermodynamic
analysis of gr-binding [44], mainly on the basis of data for
hydrocortisone (cortisol, 1) and prednisolone derivatives, sug-

gested an approximate three-fold increase for 9␣-ﬂuorination
(g0 = −2.39 kj/mol), two-fold increase for 6␣-ﬂuorination
(−1.51 kj/mol), and four-fold increase for 9␣-chlorination
(−2.97 kj/mol) in rba vs. the average of 6- to 7-fold increase
obtained here (−4.6 kj/mol). however, this study by wolff et
al. used a much more limited number of structures and did
not consider separately the ﬂuorination of cyclic 16,17-acetal
compounds, where its activity-enhancing effect seems to be
much less. it is still unclear why does 6␣- or 9␣-halogenation
increases gr-binding so signiﬁcantly, especially since the
h → f replacement is a classic isosteric replacement often
used to provide metabolic stability because of the stability of
the c–f bond and the steric similarity between h and f [90].
there seems to be, however, a clear size-limitation: bromination already decreases activity [44] (hydrocortisone, 9␣-br;
table 1). the crystal structure of the dexamethasone–receptor
complex (fig. 4) does not seem to indicate the presence of
any special interaction. interestingly, contrary to the glucocorticoid case, 6␣-halogenation (f, cl) seems to have no
effect on the binding of progesterone to its receptor [91,92].
also, whereas 6␣ or 9␣ ﬂuorination seems to have about
the same effect on gr-binding, they seem to have very different effects at the  xxxg1602xxx , substitution
at 9␣ being much more effective than at 6␣, at least in
the case of ﬂuoroprednisolone [93]. fluorination may also
cause metabolism/pharmacokinetic changes as, for example,
oxidation of steroids by 11␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
(11␤-hsd) is diminished if they are 6␣- or 9␣-ﬂuorinated [94].
however, overall human half-lives (t1/2 ) are not very different for representative cases such as dexamethasone 4.0 h vs.
prednisolone 3.2 h (p.o.) [95] or ﬂunisolide ∼1.5 h vs. budesonide ∼3.0 h (i.v., inh) [3,96]; hence, this effect, if present at all,
is much less relevant than the one produced on gr-binding
afﬁnity.
for the cyclic acetal moiety, the restricted rotation in a preferred conﬁguration, might contribute to an increased binding
afﬁnity by reducing the entropy loss on binding of a less ﬂexible ligand, and possible hydrogen bonding at the two oxygen
atoms might further enhance this effect. combining two such
different substitutions into a single indicator variable (ihal/ xxxg35xxx  )
is difﬁcult to justify from a physicochemical perspective, but
the corresponding regression coefﬁcients are statistically so
similar that it makes sense to collapse them into a single
one to reduce the number of parameters in the model. it is
also unclear why these two effects seem to cancel each other
except that the acetal substituent tends to fold in the binding
pocket under the steroid skeleton (␣ side; fig. 4), so it might
interfere with interactions at the 6/9␣-halogens even if it is farther away. on a related note, however, it might worth noting
that the corresponding g0 ≈ −4.6 kj/mol values are in excellent agreement with the estimated average free energy change
due to a hydrogen bond in aqueous solvents. the energetic of
hydrogen bonding is somewhat controversial [97], but by most
indications, while the bonding enthalpy (h) of hydrogen bonds
varies depending on the involved systems over a relatively
wide range (5–30 kj/mol), an enthalpy–entropy compensation
[98–100], characteristic especially for water, keeps the gibbs
free energy (g) of neutral hydrogen bonds in aqueous solutions
in a better deﬁned area around 3–6 kj/mol (1–1.5 kcal/mol)
[101–104] (a value also conﬁrmed in mutagenesis and stability

s t e r o i d s 7 3 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 193–208

studies of enzyme–ligand and nucleotide–nucleotide complexes [105–108]). intriguingly, it is also about the same value
that was seen as possible related to changes due to hydrogen
bonding in the log octanol–water partition coefﬁcient (log po/w )
after taking away the size (molecular volume) related effects
(4.2 kj/mol) in the qlogp model [84,109].
a 1,2 double bond that ﬂattens the a-ring has long been
assumed to enhance gr-binding. the present data indicate
a small increase, but not a statistically signiﬁcant contribution: an indicator variable in the linbiexp model results only
in a ı1,2
 = −0.24±0.56 kj/mol term and direct comparison of the
eight pairs gives −1.41±1.27 kj/mol (n = 8; table 3). the latter
corresponds to an almost two-fold increase (1.77) in rrba
and is similar to that obtained by wolff et al. on only three
pairs (−1.21 kj/mol); however, statistics did not justify its inclusion in the ﬁnal model. the presence of a 21-o substituent
(e.g., betamethasone vs. 21-deoxy betamethasone) produces
a very similar (and statistically also not signiﬁcant) change:
−1.52±1.82 kj/mol (n = 5; i.e., from comparison of ﬁve direct
pairs in the present data), which also corresponds to an almost
two-fold increase (1.84) in rrba. these two observations are in
agreement with the generally accepted sars for gr-binding
(fig. 1).
an 11-oh function is required for gr-activity, and 11-keto
compounds indeed bind too weakly and had to be omitted.
however, the 11 unsubstituted compounds (such as desoxycorticosterone or even progesterone) lack gr activity, but
still ﬁt the general biphasic pattern for binding well. furthermore, even some of the antiprogestins, which tend to
be antiglucocorticoids too, such as mifepristone or hrp 2000
that show strong gr-binding (kd < 1 nm) [68,69] (but not others such as, e.g., onapristone with a lower gr afﬁnity) ﬁt
this pattern well as they have molecular sizes close to the
predicted vmax of ∼360 å3 obtained here and afﬁnities in excellent agreement with the linbiexp predicted ones (table 1 and
fig. 3) despite having large 11␤ substituents. for illustration,
they were included in table 1 and fig. 3, but were not used
in the model development because of their different structures. even some representative nonsteroidal gr modulators
such as al-438, which has gr-binding similar to prednisolone
[110,111] and also has a very similar molecular size (v of 279.2
vs. 280.5 å3 ), or newer one such as the thienylmethylidenesubstituted ones recently published by hudson et al. [71],
which show high gr afﬁnities (kd ∼ 1 nm) and have molecular
sizes close to vmax (∼360 å3 ), seem to ﬁt the pattern predicted
here at least to some degree—even if they are not necessarily expected to do so because of their different structural
framework and substituent pattern. these seem to further
reinforce the possibility that this model indeed represents a
sort of upper limit of binding determined by the size of the
gr-binding pocket.
in conclusion, gr-binding afﬁnity of steroids that satisfy
the main binding criteria at this receptors show a biphasic
size-dependence that can be well-described by the recently
introduced linbiexp bilinear model. with this model, close
to 80% of the variability in the free energy of binding can be
accounted for by using only two descriptors: calculated molecular volume and an indicator variable for halogenation at the
6␣- or 9␣-position or the presence of a cyclic 16,17-acetal moiety. binding is strongest for corticosteroids close to an ideal

205

size and is dramatically increased by 6␣- or 9␣-halogenation or
introduction of a cyclic 16,17-acetal moiety (in average, about
6- to 7-fold), but there is no signiﬁcant increase after the ﬁrst
substitution. as long as all required structural elements are
present and ligand size is not yet prohibitively large, addition of a methylene-sized non-hydrogen atom to the ligand
structure changes g0 on average by about 1.5 kj/mol, corresponding to an almost doubling of the binding afﬁnity.
