lenalidomide (revlimid®) is approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with anemia due
to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) associated with a del 5q cytogenetic
abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and in combination with dexamethasone
for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. previous
reports suggest that lenalidomide is anti-angiogenic and this property appears to be related to efﬁcacy in
patients with mds. we have investigated the effect of lenalidomide on the formation of microvessels in a
novel in vitro angiogenesis assay utilizing human umbilical arterial rings and in a capillary-like cord
formation assay using cultured primary endothelial cells. we found that lenalidomide consistently inhibits
both sprout formation by arterial rings and cord formation by endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner.
we also found an inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on the associations between  xxxg405xxx , beta-catenin and
 xxxg1724xxx , adherens junction proteins whose interaction is critical for endothelial cell cord formation.
furthermore, lenalidomide inhibited vegf-induced pi3k–akt pathway signaling, which is known to regulate
adherens junction formation. we also found a strong inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on hypoxia-induced
endothelial cell formation of cords and  xxxg1048xxx  expression, the main mediator of hypoxia-mediated effects
and a key driver of angiogenesis and metastasis. anti-metastatic activity of lenalidomide in vivo was
conﬁrmed in the b16-f10 mouse melanoma model by a n 40% reduction in melanoma lung colony counts
versus untreated mice. our results suggest that inhibitory effects on microvessel formation, in particular
adherens junction formation and inhibition of hypoxia-induced processes support a potential antiangiogenic and anti-metastatic mechanism for this clinically active drug.

introduction
angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed
from pre-existing vessels and plays a major role in a number of
physiological events, such as embryogenesis and wound healing.
however, angiogenesis is also associated with pathological conditions,
including cancer and much effort is being made in order to clinically
develop inhibitors of this process (carmeliet and jain, 2000; hanahan
and weinberg, 2000; kerbel and folkman, 2002; boehm-viswanathan, 2000; blagosklonny, 2004). angiogenesis is a complex process
that is mediated by soluble growth factors, adhesion molecules, and
extracellular matrix proteins and involves proteolysis, migration,

invasion, tubule formation and cell proliferation. hypoxia is the main
stimulus for this process, via the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor
(hif)-1alpha with subsequent activation of essential factors such as vegf
and b-fgf (blagosklonny, 2004; harris, 2002; pouysségur et al., 2006).
these growth factors stimulate capillary growth into the tumor,
supplying oxygen and essential nutrients that allow the tumor mass to
proliferate and expand. for example, endothelial cell induction of hif1alpha during periods of low oxygen tension (hypoxia) has recently been
shown to drive the angiogenic process via a b-fgf-dependent
autocrine loop (calvani et al., 2006). the ability of endothelial cells
to form tubes is essential to the angiogenic response and has been
shown to be dependent on the interaction of adherens junction
proteins, such as  xxxg405xxx ,  xxxg1724xxx  and beta-catenin (kataoka et al., 2002;
lin et al., 2003). in endothelial cells,  xxxg405xxx  and  xxxg1724xxx  connect to betacatenin, which is linked to f-actin as a part of the adherens junction
complex (matsumura et al., 1997). the  xxxg1377xxx  akt is
an important downstream component of the angiogenic response in
endothelial cells and is also activated in many cancer cells, leading to

l. lu et al. / microvascular research 77 (2009) 78–86

increased motility and invasiveness (kawasaki et al., 2003). arsham
et al. demonstrated that akt can inﬂuence both angiogenesisdependent and -independent tumor growth (arsham et al., 2004).
lenalidomide has proven efﬁcacy in patients with previously
treated multiple myeloma and in patients with del 5q mds
(richardson et al., 2006; list et al., 2006). anti-angiogenic activity
has been demonstrated in chromosome deletion 5q patients with mds
who respond to treatment (beusche et al., 2005) and in several in vitro
and in vivo models (dredge et al., 2002, 2005; bartlett et al., 2004).
however, the molecular mechanism by which it inhibits angiogenesis
has not been elucidated, nor have its effects on endothelial cells been
studied in the hypoxic environment considered to be a driving force for
angiogenesis during tumor growth in vivo. in the current study, we
demonstrate that lenalidomide inhibits microvessel formation using a
novel human umbilical arterial ring assay and also inhibits vegfinduced endothelial cell cord formation. this is associated with
inhibition of the association of the adherens junction proteins cadherin
5, beta-catenin and  xxxg1724xxx  as well as inhibition of akt phosphorylation.
finally, we show that lenalidomide is able to inhibit the induction of
endothelial cell  xxxg1048xxx  and subsequent cord formation in response to
low oxygen concentrations.  xxxg1048xxx  is also a key regulator of metastasis
(liao et al., 2007). overall, these properties suggest potential as an antimetastatic agent and we have conﬁrmed this by demonstrating its
activity in the b16-f10 mouse melanoma lung metastasis model.

in egm-2 medium plus ecgs (200 mg/ml). inhibition of angiogenesis
was deﬁned as the change in sprout formation for each compound
normalized to dmso in each assay. the anti-angiogenic agent
 xxxd2166xxx  (1 mum) served as a positive control to demonstrate
maximum inhibition of sprout formation (i.e., 0% angiogenesis).
vessel outgrowth was scored both as quantitative comparison to
positive and negative controls, and morphometrically as both
maximal distance of vessel sprout growth in microns from the vessel
ring and as the total area of endothelial cell coverage/area of vessel
ring. the images were taken by nikon digital camera dxm1200 using
act-1 software (version 2.1.2) and analyzed using image-pro plus
software (media cybernetics, inc. md) and metamorph (version 6.1,
universal imagine, pa). ic50 values for each compound were calculated
using non-linear regression, sigmoidal dose–response, constraining
the top to 100% and bottom to 0%, allowing variable slope using
graphpad prism v4.00.
endothelial cell cord formation (differentiation) assay
huvecs were grown to 70%–80% conﬂuence and then seeded at
2 × 104 cells per well in the presence or absence of test compounds onto
96-well plates pre-coated with matrigel (bd biosciences, bedford, ma).
the cells were allowed to form capillary-like cords overnight at 37 °c in
5% co2. the cells were then stained with calcein am according to the
manufacturer's instructions. images of the vessels were captured using
ﬂuorescence microscopy and analyzed using metamorph angiogenesis
module software (molecular devices, union city, ca).

antibodies and reagents
hypoxia and  xxxg1048xxx  induction
lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx  and thalidomide (celgene corporation, summit, nj), were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) to
prepare stock solutions. the ﬁnal concentration of dmso was kept at
0.1% for all the in vitro assays. all the antibodies for the western blots
were purchased from cell signaling technology (danvers, ma) and
santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). the hif-2alpha antibody was
purchased from novus biologicals (littleton, co).
cells
a mouse melanoma cell line b16-f10 (american type culture
collection, manassas, va) was maintained in rpmi-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.75%
sodium bicarbonate, 10 mum hepes buffer, 50 units/ml penicillin–
streptomycin and 25 mug/ml gentamicin. the human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (huvec, cambrex, walkersville, md) used in this
study were restricted to use between passage 3 and 5 throughout.
they were cultured in ebm-2 medium (cambrex) with singlequots™
(supplements and growth factors containing hydrocortisone, hegf,
fbs, vegf, hfgf-b, r3-igf-1,  xxxd228xxx , heparin and  xxxd2193xxx /
 xxxd164xxx ).
human umbilical arterial ring angiogenesis assay
fresh human umbilical cords were collected less than 24 h after
delivery from local hospitals and with full donor-informed consent.
vessels were cleaned of connective tissue and vessel rings were cut
cross-wise in a length of ∼ 1 mm. the rings were placed into ebm-2
(endothelial basal medium-2 with no growth factors) medium in a
50 ml conical bottom tube. the vessel rings were rinsed in egm-2
medium (cambrex) and placed on matrigel (bd biosciences, bedford,
ma) coated agarose ring wells and covered with additional matrigel
(250 mul) and allowed to gel for 30–45 min at 37 °c. they were then
cultured for 24 h in ebm-2 with endothelial cell growth supplement
(200 mug/ml; ecgs, sigma).each test compound was evaluated at
various concentrations to enable dose–response analysis. maximum
angiogenesis (100%) was deﬁned as sprout formation with 0.1% dmso

huvecs were cultured in 100 mm dishes with egm-2 medium until
70%–80% conﬂuence. the cells were starved in ebm-2 medium
(without growth factors) for 5 h and then cultured overnight under
normoxic and hypoxic conditions (in the modular incubator chamber
with certiﬁed gas mixture containing 1% o2, 5% co2 and 94% n2) in the
presence of  xxxd2984xxx  or lenalidomide. the cell lysates were
prepared in ripa buffer and  xxxg1048xxx  and hif2-alpha expression levels were
measured by western blot and (for  xxxg1048xxx ) duoset ic elisa kit (r and d
systems, minneapolis, mn). the western blot bands were quantiﬁed by
densitometric analysis and normalized to  xxxg53xxx .
immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
huvecs were plated at 1 × 106 cells on each 100 mm cell culture
dish with egm-2 medium and allowed to form conﬂuent monolayers
overnight. the cells were then serum-starved for 24 h and then pretreated with lenalidomide for 2 h. the cells were then stimulated
with vegf (10 ng/ml) for the ﬁnal 15 min of culture and then lysed
in a ripa buffer (10 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm cacl2,
1% np40, 1% triton x-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail). a total of
60 mug of cell lysate from each treatment sample was loaded per lane
on 10% tris–glycine polyacrylamide gels. after electrophoreses, the
proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the
membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder solution in pbst
for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °c with either anti-phosphoakt, total akt,  xxxg1048xxx  or anti- xxxg53xxx . the membranes were then
developed using the ecl plus chemiluminescence detection system.
the western blot bands were quantiﬁed by densitometric analysis
and normalized to total akt or  xxxg53xxx .
to evaluate the interactions between  xxxg405xxx , beta-catenin and
 xxxg1724xxx , huvecs were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per 150 mm cell culture
dish with varying concentrations oﬂenalidomide overnight. the cells
were then harvested and lysed in a ripa buffer. the cell lysates were
pre-cleared with gammabind g sepharose (20 mul) to overcome nonspeciﬁc binding. the proteins were then immunoprecipitated at 4 °c
overnight with either beta-catenin,  xxxg405xxx  or  xxxg1724xxx  antibodies bound

to gammabind g sepharose (50 mul). the immunoprecipitates were
washed twice with the lysis buffer before processing for western
blotting with antibody to the relevant adherens junction protein. the
western blot bands were shown to be equally loaded by analysis of igg
and the immunoprecipitated protein.

all mice were sacriﬁced via cervical dislocation. the lungs were
removed with minimal bronchi and weighed. melanotic colonies,
visible on the surfaces of the lungs, were enumerated.

lung metastasis model

lenalidomide (revlimid),  xxxd2984xxx  and thalidomide inhibit the
formation of sprouts from human arterial rings

the b16-f10 mouse melanoma lung metastasis model was used in
this investigation using female b6d2f-1 mice (charles river laboratories, wilmington, ma) which were 6–7 weeks old on day 1 of the
study. the mice were housed on irradiated alpha-dri® bed-o'cobs®
laboratory animal bedding in static micro-isolators on a 12-hour light
cycle at 21–22 °c (70–72 °f) and 40–60% humidity. this speciﬁcally
complies with the recommendations of the guide for care and use of
laboratory animals with respect to restraint, husbandry, surgical
procedures, feed and ﬂuid regulation, and veterinary care. b16-f10
melanoma cells were maintained as an exponentially growing culture
in rpmi-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. all the mice were
inoculated via the tail vein with 1.5 × 105 cells in 0.2 ml pbs. the mice
were then separated into groups of 10 animals each. control animals
received no drug treatment. one group received cyclophosphamide
(300 mg/kg single dose on day 1) as a positive control. to the third
group lenalidomide was administered i.p. at 50 mg/kg once daily for
the duration of the study. the end point for the study was 100 tumor
nodules per lung set that could be easily seen for counting. on day 18,

results

in the human umbilical artery explant assay untreated and
dmso-treated control tissue showed signiﬁcant outgrowth of
sprouts after three to four weeks of culture (fig. 1). the addition of
lenalidomide to the cultures twice per week over a 4–5-week period
consistently inhibited the formation of microvessel outgrowth in a
dose-dependent manner (when compared with either untreated or
dmso-treated samples). at high concentrations (100 mum), lenalidomide completely inhibits sprout formation. thalidomide and
 xxxd2984xxx  showed greater activity in this assay. the  xxxg482xxx   xxxd2166xxx  (1 mug/ml; calbiochem, ca) was used as
a 0% angiogenesis control in this assay.
lenalidomide inhibits vegf-induced and hypoxia-induced endothelial
cell cord formation
we assessed the effects of lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx  and
thalidomide on vegf-induced endothelial cell (huvec) capillary-like

described in materials and methods. the rings were treated with lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx , thalidomide (0.1 mum–100 mum),  xxxd2166xxx  or vehicle (dmso control, 0.1%v/v) for four
weeks and analyzed for the formation of sprouts using image-pro plus software.

fig. 2. lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx  and thalidomide inhibit vegf-induced endothelial cell cord formation. monolayer of endothelial cells (huvec) on matrigel was (a) stimulated
with vegf and then treated with lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx , thalidomide (0.1 mum–100 mum) or dmso (0.1%v/v) as described in materials and methods. the data from three separate
experiments was quantiﬁed using angiogenesis module software (metamorph). percentage inhibition (by drug versus control) of each parameter was calculated by the formula:
treatment value minus control value divided by control value (stimulated) minus control value (unstimulated). representative images from a single experiment are shown in (b).

ebm-2 medium under normoxic conditions (21% o2). the addition of
lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx  or thalidomide to the cells consistently
inhibited endothelial cell cord formation, as assessed by multiple
parameters, in a dose-dependent manner.  xxxd2984xxx  and
lenalidomide were found to be more potent than thalidomide in
reducing both cord length and cord area.
lenalidomide blocks the association of the adherens junction proteins betacatenin,  xxxg405xxx  and  xxxg1724xxx 
we next investigated whether lenalidomide might interfere with
the interactions between beta-catenin,  xxxg405xxx  and  xxxg1724xxx  in
endothelial cells. to test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from lenalidomide treated endothelial
cells (huvec) using paired combinations of anti-beta-catenin, anticadherin 5 or anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibodies (i.e. immunoprecipitation with
one antibody and probe with another). we found that lenalidomide
inhibited the association of these proteins (i.e.,  xxxg405xxx  with betacatenin,  xxxg405xxx  with  xxxg1724xxx  and beta-catenin with  xxxg1724xxx ) in a dosedependent manner when compared with dmso-treated samples
(fig. 3). these results suggest a potential anti-angiogenic mechanism

involving interference with the association of adherens junction
proteins.
lenalidomide blocks vegf-induced endothelial cell akt phosphorylation
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
we tested the effect of lenalidomide on the vegf-induced
phosphorylation of endothelial cell akt-1. stimulation of endothelial
cells (huvec) with vegf enhanced akt-1 phosphorylation when
compared with unstimulated cells (dmso control, fig. 4). lenalidomide appeared to inhibit akt-1 phosphorylation (site ser473 and
thr308 upper band, indicated by arrow) in a dose-dependent manner,
and when compared with dmso-treated cells. the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitor  xxxd3536xxx  was used as a positive
control in those experiments.
lenalidomide inhibits  xxxg1048xxx  but not hif-2alpha protein expression in
endothelial cells
we then assessed the ability of lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx  and
thalidomide to inhibit the hypoxia-induced expression of  xxxg1048xxx  and

fig. 4. lenalidomide inhibits endothelial cell akt phosphorylation. endothelial cells (huvec) were treated with lenalidomide (1 mum–100 mum) or dmso (0.1%) in the presence of vegf
(10 ng/ml) as described in materials and methods. the treated cells were lysed and the cell lysates were assessed by western blot. the upper band (indicated by an arrow) represents
phosphorylated akt the intensity of which increases dramatically when cells are treated with vegf. addition of lenalidomide signiﬁcantly attenuates vegf-induced phosphorylation.

hif-2alpha in endothelial cells. endothelial cells (huvec) were cultured in
basal medium under normoxic and hypoxic conditions with various
concentrations of the three drugs. the expression levels of  xxxg1048xxx  and
hif-2alpha were assessed by western blot. as expected, and as shown in
fig. 5a/b,  xxxg1048xxx  was undetectable in normoxic conditions but was
signiﬁcantly induced when cells were subject to hypoxic conditions.
hif-2alpha was constitutively expressed in endothelial cells and its
expression was relatively unchanged in hypoxic conditions (fig. 5c).
we found that lenalidomide dramatically inhibited  xxxg1048xxx  expression,
with an ic50 of approximately 1 mum, and that hif-2alpha expression
remained unaffected (fig. 5c). similarly,  xxxd2984xxx  was able to
inhibit  xxxg1048xxx  expression (with no effect on hif-2alpha), although it was a
little less effective. thalidomide was far less effective. the results
obtained using endothelial cells from three donors are summarized
(fig. 5). (p b 0.01).
lenalidomide inhibits endothelial cell cord formation in hypoxic
conditions
the cord assay was then amended to assess the effect of
lenalidomide in a hypoxic environment (low oxygen concentration).
endothelial cells (huvec) were seeded in medium with and without
growth factors and exposed to the drugs under normoxic and hypoxic
conditions. we found that lenalidomide potently inhibits b-fgfinduced endothelial cell cord formation in dose-dependent manner

83

(fig. 6), although potency appeared to be reduced compared to
inhibition under normoxic conditions. multiparameter ic50 values,
derived from data obtained from 4 donors are shown in fig. 6.
lenalidomide inhibits the formation of lung metastatic foci
the effects of lenalidomide on metastasis were evaluated in the
b16-f10 mouse melanoma lung model. b16-f10 melanoma cells were
injected into b6d2f-1 mice via the tail vein with mice then receiving
lenalidomide or cyclophosphamide (the positive control) until day 18
at which time mice were sacriﬁced to examine the formation lung
metastatic foci. we found a 34% reduction of lung weight in the
presence of lenalidomide compared to the untreated control group
(fig. 7; median lung weight, 264 mg versus 397 mg respectively;
p = 0.0002). similarly, median metastatic foci were reduced by 41%
(63 versus 106 respectively; p b 0.0001). cyclophosphamide treatment
led to a 97% decrease in the median colony count and a 46% lower
median lung weight (215 mg).
discussion
tumor growth depends on angiogenesis, a complex process that
requires the participation of a variety of growth factors and cell
populations. pro-angiogenic factors such as vegf, b-fgf, il-8 and  xxxg2269xxx  are secreted by both malignant cells and supporting stromal cells

fig. 5. lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  inhibit endothelial cell  xxxg1048xxx  expression. endothelial cells (huvec) were cultured in basal medium under normoxic and hypoxic (1% o2 in
the modular incubator chamber) conditions and in the presence of varying concentrations of  xxxd2984xxx  and lenalidomide for ~ 18 h. the cell lysates were harvested in ripa buffer.
the levels of  xxxg1048xxx  and hif-2alpha were measured by western blot. for  xxxg1048xxx  the bands were quantiﬁed by densitometric analysis and normalized to  xxxg53xxx .

fig. 6. lenalidomide inhibits b-fgf-induced endothelial cell cord formation in hypoxic conditions. lenalidomide was tested in the endothelial cell (huvec) cord assay under hypoxic
conditions. endothelial cells (2 × 104/well) were seeded with serial diluted compounds in basal ebm2 medium onto 96-well pre-coated matrigel wells with b-fgf (20 ng/ml) added to
the cells. the plate was incubated at 37 °c in the hypoxic chamber for 18 h. the ﬂuorescence stained images from four separate experiments donor cells from four donors were
captured by ﬂuorescent microscopy and then analyzed using the metamorph angiogenesis module software program. total tubule length is a measurement of microns of vessel
length; total tubule area a measurement of total square microns of vessel area; branch points are the total number of junctions connecting segments (nodes are not considered

and act upon endothelial cells to enable the formation of vasculature
required to support tumor growth. generally, in vitro models of
angiogenesis have focused on endothelial cell proliferation, migration
and capillary-like cord formation (differentiation) (staton et al., 2004).
previously published results indicate that while thalidomide, lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  do not affect endothelial cell proliferation,

inhibitory effects have been shown for lenalidomide on endothelial
cell migration and for all three drugs on endothelial cell cord
formation(dredge et al., 2005). in fact, previous data from the cord
assay, as well as the rat aorta ring assay, indicated that thalidomide
was less potent than both lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  (dredge
et al., 2002).

in order to further characterize the anti-angiogenic activities of
these drugs, we established a novel in vitro assay system, the umbilical
artery explant ring assay, in an attempt to physiologically mimic the
angiogenic process in vivo as closely as possible. the explanted tissue
includes quiescent endothelial cells, surrounded by smooth muscle
cells and pericytes, which can respond to angiogenic stimulus and
proliferate, migrate from the existing vessel and differentiate into
capillaries. using this assay we found that lenalidomide,  xxxd2984xxx  and thalidomide all inhibit microvessel outgrowths in a dosedependent manner when compared to untreated rings. thalidomide is
a known anti-angiogenic agent (d'amato et al., 1994). however we
were surprised to ﬁnd that thalidomide was ∼3-fold more effective
than  xxxd2984xxx  and ∼10-fold more effective than lenalidomide.
this is in contrast with previous results from multiple in vitro assays
suggesting that lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  were ∼10-fold more
effective than thalidomide (dredge et al., 2002). this prompted us to
re-examine the inhibitory effects of these compounds on endothelial
cell cord formation and migration. in the cord formation assay we
conﬁrmed that lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  are more potent at
inhibiting the formation of capillary-like cords from endothelial cells
cultured in matrigel. this assay measures the ability to simultaneously
inhibit endothelial cell attachment, migration and differentiation.
however, in the migration assay we found that, similar to the
umbilical explant assay, thalidomide is more potent at inhibiting the
ability of endothelial cells to migrate to growth factor stimuli (data not
shown). that thalidomide is less active in the rat aorta assay is likely
due to a more pronounced effect on human endothelial cells
compared to rodent endothelial cells. overall, this data suggests that
thalidomide is a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell migration whereas
lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  are more potent inhibitors of other
aspects of the angiogenic process, such as differentiation.
prior to the initiation of vessel lumen formation it is necessary for
the loosening of adherens junctions between endothelial cells.
conversely, the formation of strong intracellular junctions between
endothelial cells is necessary for the formation of capillary tubes. the
junctions between endothelial cells contain transmembrane proteins
belonging to the cadherin superfamily, which are linked to
cytoskeletal proteins through beta-catenin. it was previously shown
that truncation of the cytoplasmic region of  xxxg405xxx  abolishes its
effects on cell growth (matsumura et al., 1997). the adhesion protein
 xxxg1724xxx , a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is highly
expressed on endothelial cells, is known to play a role in vascular
tube formation (lin et al., 2003). it has also been demonstrated that
 xxxg405xxx  and  xxxg1724xxx  both connect to beta-catenin during endothelial
tube formation and that antibodies against these proteins inhibit
tube formation (matsumura et al., 1997). data from the current study
indicate that lenalidomide inhibits the vegf-induced association
between these three proteins, an effect likely to prevent the
formation of vessel lumen.
our results in the current study also indicate that lenalidomide
inhibits the phosphorylation of vegf-induced akt-1 on serine 473 and
threonine 308 in endothelial cells. this extends previous results that
showed an inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on b-fgf-induced akt
phosphorylation(dredge et al., 2005) and suggests a general inhibitory
effect on the pi3k–akt signaling axis downstream of the multiple
receptor tyrosine kinases that feed into this system. in endothelial cells
the pi3k–akt axis is activated by a variety of growth factor stimuli and
regulates multiple steps in the angiogenic process, including endothelial cell survival, association of adhesion junction protein complexes,
migration and vessel formation (shiojima and walsh, 2002).
the pi3k–akt pathway is known to have an important role in the
induction of hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1alpha, which is the main
mediator of the response to oxygen deprivation or hypoxia
(pouysségur et al., 2006; mottet et al., 2003). the central role of
hypoxia in the induction of angiogenesis and tumor invasion led us
to examine the effect of lenalidomide on endothelial cell hypoxia-

induced  xxxg1048xxx  expression and hypoxia-induced components of the
angiogenic process in vitro. endothelial cells are exposed to hypoxia
due to the generation of structurally abnormal tumor vasculature
leading to intermittent ﬂuctuations in red blood cell ﬂow within the
vascular trees(calvani et al., 2006; martinive et al., 2006). we found
that lenalidomide completely and dose-dependently inhibits  xxxg1048xxx ,
but not hif-2alpha, protein levels in hypoxic endothelial cells. the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd2984xxx  was a little less impressive and did
not appear to be dose-dependent. thalidomide was not able to
signiﬁcantly inhibit  xxxg1048xxx  when tested at a high concentration.
next, we found that under hypoxic conditions both lenalidomide and
 xxxd2984xxx  were able to inhibit vegf-induced akt phosphorylation in a similar manner to that seen in normal conditions (data not
shown). we then assessed the ability of these drugs to inhibit a
recently described model of endothelial cell angiogenesis driven by
an hif-1-dependent b-fgf autocrine loop (calvani et al., 2006).
again, we found that lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  were strongly
inhibitory in this assay.
in conclusion, this report adds to the previous literature suggesting
that lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  are anti-angiogenic agents by
showing activity in a novel human umbilical vein explant assay. we
have also extended previous ﬁndings to report potentially important
mechanistic effects on adherens junction proteins and vegf-induced
akt activation. furthermore, we have demonstrated potent inhibitory
effects on hypoxia-induced processes, including inhibition of  xxxg1048xxx ,
which is central to the initiation of a transcriptional program that
promotes an aggressive tumor phenotype leading to metastasis and
tissue invasion, at least partly by inhibiting activation of the pi3k–akt
signaling pathway. the ability of lenalidomide to inhibit lung
metastases in the b16-f10 mouse melanoma model is further
indication that this drug is an anti-cancer agent with multiple
activities. these results enhance our understanding of the potential
activities of lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  in the treatment of
hematological and solid tumors.
