introduction
secondary hyperparathyroidism (shpt) develops progressively during the course of chronic kidney disease (ckd).
phosphorus retention and reduced synthesis of 1–25 vitamin d result in low serum calcium levels, which causes a
feedback secretion of intact  xxxg1885xxx  (ipth).
long-term hyperstimulation of parathyroids enhances cell
proliferation resulting first in diffuse polyclonal hyperplasia and finally in monoclonal nodular hyperplasia [1–3].
since nodular hyperplasia does not involve all parathyroid
glands, or all patients with ckd, to the same degree, it is
logical to suppose that genetic mechanisms are involved
[4–7].
glandular volume is a key marker for the severity of
shpt and increased secretion of ipth [3,8]. however, only
indirect measurements of parathyroid volumes are possible
due to their location, small size and the difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements of glandular volume with
common non-invasive techniques. in healthy patients, the
identification of parathyroid glands is particularly difficult
[9]. in shpt, hyperplastic glands become distinguishable
from the thyroid parenchyma due to their increased cellularity. high-resolution colour doppler (cd) sonography is
the only tomographic technique able to measure accurately
volumetric variations in parathyroid glands. there is no
defined size limit over which a parathyroid gland can be
considered pathological, although a hypoechoic gland with
two diameters >5 mm is generally considered to be hyperplastic [10]. in addition, cd sonography simultaneously
provides semi-quantitative measurements of glandular perfusion [11–13].
patients are considered to have severe shpt when serum
phosphorus (p), calcium (ca), the ca–p product (ca × p)
and ipth levels can no longer be adequately controlled by
conventional therapies [14], and when clinical symptoms

abstract
background. the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on the structural
pattern of hyperplastic parathyroid glands was evaluated,
using high-resolution colour doppler (cd) sonography,
in haemodialysis patients with severe, inadequately controlled, secondary hyperparathyroidism (shpt).
methods. nine patients (6 males, 3 females; mean age
± sd, 55.5 ± 12.6 years) received  xxxd1701xxx , with adaptation of existing concomitant therapies. biochemical parameters and the morphology and vascular pattern of hyperplastic parathyroid glands were measured at baseline and
every 6 months thereafter, for a follow-up period of 24–30
months.
results. at baseline, 28 hyperplastic glands were identified.  xxxd1701xxx  led to a reduction in glandular volume
during the course of the study: 68% in glands with a baseline volume <500 mm3 and 54% in glands with a baseline
volume ≥500 mm3 . the mean volume ± sd of glands
<500 mm3 changed significantly from the baseline (233 ±
115 mm3 ) to the end of follow-up (102 ± 132 mm3 , p =
0.007). levels of mean serum phosphorus, calcium and
calcium–phosphorus product decreased, but not significantly, whereas there were significant decreases in mean
 xxxg1885xxx  ± sd levels (1196 ± 381 pg/ml versus 256 ± 160 pg/ml; p < 0.0001) and alkaline phosphatase
± sd levels (428 ± 294 versus 223 ± 88 iu/l; p = 0.04),
accompanied by an improvement in a subjective clinical
score.
conclusions.  xxxd1701xxx , in combination with conventional
treatments, led to an improvement in biochemical and clinical parameters of shpt and reduced glandular volume in
patients with severe shpt. volume reduction was more evident in smaller glands. longer term, larger, randomized
clinical trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings and to further define a more systematic approach in
the treatment of shpt.

subjects and methods
patients
nine consecutive mhd patients awaiting ptx at our
nephrology and dialysis unit (6 males, 3 females; mean
age ± sd, 56 ± 13 years) were recruited and prospectively
studied. all patients had severe shpt, and none, due to age,
or cardiovascular or general conditions, was an ideal candidate for ptx. in our centre, patients undergo subtotal ptx
when one or more glands have a volume >500 mm3 by cd
sonography and ipth values are >700 pg/ml, to avoid the
risk of nodular degeneration of the remnant glands. during
the period of the study, one additional young patient awaiting transplantation stopped treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  after
1 month due to drug intolerance (epigastralgia). she was
excluded from the study and underwent ptx.
as comparison, we have considered a historical control
group that included 11 consecutive patients with clinical,
biochemical and morphological signs of severe and refractory shpt treated with conventional ptx between 2003
and 2006.
study design
the treatment protocol integrated  xxxd1701xxx  with patients’
existing pharmacological shpt therapies (calcium supplements, phosphate binders or vitamin d sterols). treatment
with  xxxd1701xxx  did not require a pharmacological wash-out
period. the starting dose of  xxxd1701xxx  was 30 mg/day. this
was increased by 30 mg every 21–30 days, until the patient reached the targets indicated in the kdoqitm guidelines. the maximum dose of  xxxd1701xxx  administered was
150 mg/day. as  xxxd1701xxx  treatment was used for compassionate use before commercialization in italy, all patients
signed an informed consent form.

conventional therapy was adjusted during follow-up according to the optima algorithm [23]. when indicated, the
dose of a vitamin d sterol was reduced by ∼50% in sequential steps until a minimum administered dose was reached:
intravenous calcitriol, 0.5 µg three times per week; intravenous  xxxd109xxx , 1 µg three times per week; intravenous
 xxxd2851xxx , 2 µg three times per week; oral calcitriol, 0.25
µg three times per week; oral  xxxd109xxx , 0.25 µg/day.
the dose of  xxxd1701xxx  was reduced if a patient was not
receiving vitamin d. phosphate binder dosages were modulated depending on serum ca and p levels in an attempt to
maintain ca × p within the international guidelines range
[23,13].
biochemical parameters [p, ca, ca × p, ipth and alkaline phosphatase (alp)] and the morphology and vascular
pattern of the parathyroid glands were measured at baseline
and every 6 months thereafter, for a follow-up period of
24–30 months. changes in  xxxd1701xxx  dosing and the onset
of any side effects were recorded throughout this period.
ipth was measured using the nichols irma method.
to prove the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on the functional behaviour of parathyroid glands, an additional experiment was
performed to see whether or not serum ipth increased immediately after an interruption of  xxxd1701xxx . in the absence
of any change in other treatments, the drug was stopped for
2 weeks in three patients who had experienced the highest
reductions in ipth and gland volume and in two patients
who had experienced the highest reduction in ipth, but
only mild reductions in gland volume and vascularization.
ipth was measured twice, under exactly the same conditions (i.e. at morning, before the dialysis, at the start and at
the end of the test and finally 2 weeks after restarting the
therapy).

imaging techniques
high-resolution cd sonography was carried out in our
unit by an expert nephrologist using digital equipment
(logiq 9tm , general electric medical systems, usa) and
a small parts linear array (matrix 1.5d). transmission frequency (9–14 mhz) provided an axial and a lateral resolution of 0.2 mm. images were acquired using harmonic
imaging and spatial compounding to reduce speckle.
patients were examined with the neck hyperextended in
a supine decubitus. the anatomical location of the parathyroid glands [23–25] was determined by a sequence of transverse, longitudinal and oblique scans in the laterocervical
region from the corner of the jaw to the superior mediastinum. the mediocervical transverse scan was essential to
identify the thyroid lobes and isthmus. the same transverse
scan along the laterocervical line was used to identify the
usual landmarks (sternocleidomastoid muscle, pre-thyroid
muscles, epiaortic vessels, oesophagus, pre-vertebral muscles). longitudinal and oblique scans were used to define
the anatomical relationships with the homolateral thyroid
lobe, the oesophagus, the long muscles of the neck, the laterocervical vessels and the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.
additional oblique scans were carried out on the jugular
fossa to identify the inferior parathyroid glands, sometimes
located in the superior mediastinum or in the horn of the
thymus. the inferior thyroid artery in the mid-cervical tract

are associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [14,15]. following international guidelines, parathyroidectomy (ptx) becomes
mandatory when one or more parathyroid glands are enlarged (volume >500 mm3 ), ipth values are >700 pg/ml
and the response to conventional therapy is poor [13,16–
19].
the introduction of the calcimimetic  xxxd1701xxx 
r
r
( xxxd1701xxx 
/ xxxd1701xxx 
) into clinical practice has led to its
use in patients with various degrees of severity of shpt, including those who are not candidates for ptx.  xxxd1701xxx 
is an allosteric modulator of the calcium receptor (car).
it increases the sensitivity of the car to activation by extracellular calcium and thus suppresses pth release, while
simultaneously lowering levels of serum p and ca, and ca ×
p [13,20–23]. however, no studies to date have been published evaluating morphological variations in the parathyroid glands of maintenance haemodialysis (mhd) patients
treated with  xxxd1701xxx .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on the morphology (volume, structure and vascular pattern) of parathyroid glands in mhd patients with severe
shpt, in relation to biochemical parameters and the duration of therapy, using high-resolution cd sonography.

statistical analysis
data were analysed using student’s t-test for paired and
non-paired data and were considered significant for values
of p < 0.05. the conformity of our data set was measured
using the icc (an icc >0.70 was considered valid). the
correlation between two variables was assessed using the
pearson product–moment correlation coefficient.

was also located to define vascularization of parathyroid
glands.
normal parathyroid glands are rich in adipose cells so
they are indistinguishable from the thyroid parenchyma
even using high-resolution probes. glandular hyperplasia
changes the ultrasound pattern: the gland becomes diffusely
hypoechoic and is outlined from the thyroid parenchyma
by a thin hyperechoic edge. using the ellipsoid formula
(4/3 pi × 1/2 anteroposterior diameter × 1/2 latero-lateral
diameter × 1/2 craniocaudal diameter), it is possible to
calculate the gland volume in mm3 . glands with nodular
hyperplasia appear as hypoechoic nodules that are well outlined from the thyroid lobes in common locations. glands
with at least two diameters >5 mm and a volume <500 mm3
are considered definitively to be pathological (diffuse or
polyclonal hyperplasia), whereas glands with a diameter
>1 cm and overall volume ≥500 mm3 are considered to
have monoclonal nodular degeneration [16,17,25,26]. parameters used to evaluate morphological changes in the
glands were (1) gland diameter and volume; (2) presence
of anechoic areas (suggesting cystic degeneration) [27] and
absence of vascularized areas; (3) echogenicity.
b-mode sonography was combined with cd sampling.
nodular flow was characterized using a pulse repetition
frequency (prf) <800 khz, cd frequency 3.8 mhz and
mid-high colour gain (set to 45–50, with a range of 0–60),
and a steering angle of 30◦ . vascular pattern is a semiquantitative parameter, dependent on both the settings of the
sonolayer and subjective evaluation by the operator. three
different vascularization patterns were identified: type 1,
glands with no doppler signal; type 2, hypovascularized
glands with a poor or weak doppler signal, represented
by occasional colour spots in the hilar/endonodular region;
type 3, hypervascularized glands having an enlarged feeding artery at the hilum, a peripheral arc of vascularity and/or
ray-like endonodular vessels [27–29] (figure 1). all sonographic examinations were recorded and reviewed by two
other skilled operators who used the same parameters. an
intra-class correlation coefficient (icc) was used to assess inter-observer reliability. intra-observer icc was 0.95
whereas inter-observer icc was 0.91 for measurements of
glandular volume.

causes of ckd were hereditary and/or congenital (n =
4), glomerulonephritis (n = 3), pyelonephritis (n = 1) and
chronic ischaemic nephropathy (n = 1). causes of ckd
in the control group were hereditary and/or congenital
(n = 3), glomerulonephritis (n = 6) and pyelonephritis
(n = 2). baseline biochemical parameters of mineral
metabolism were consistent with severe shpt and were
similar in the two groups. mean values of serum p and ca,
ca × p, ipth, alp, mean dialytic age and mean duration
of pre-dialysis ckd duration are presented in table 1.

of cystic degeneration. the mean volume ± sd was 731 ±
897 mm3 (range 42–4180 mm3 ): 15 glands had a volume
<500 mm3 , whereas 13 glands had a volume ≥500 mm3 ;
cd sampling revealed a hypervascular pattern in the hyperplastic glands. pre-surgical sonography in the historical
control group revealed 36 glands (two glands in two patients, three glands in four patients and four glands in five
patients). the mean volume ± sd was 798 ± 740 mm3
(range 55–2257 mm3 ): 19 glands had a volume <500 mm3
and 17 glands a volume ≥500 mm3 . none of the glands
showed cystic degeneration. also in this group, cd sampling revealed a hypervascular pattern in the hyperplastic
glands. the clinical, biochemical and sonographic profiles
of the two groups are outlined in table 1. forty glands were
excised. at histological examination, 18 glands showed a
nodular pattern, while 22 glands revealed a diffused hyperplasia. glands with a nodular pattern showed a sonographic
volume ≥500 mm3 in 84% of cases.

the appearance of extended anechoic areas of cystic degeneration. figure 5 shows 1 of the 11 glands that had reduced

twenty-eight glands of various shapes and volumes were
examined at baseline and at 6 monthly intervals until the
end of the follow-up period. overall, the mean volume ±
sd of the glands did not change significantly during the
course of the study (from 731 ± 897 mm3 at baseline to
539 ± 1017 mm3 ; p = 0.5), but there was a correlation
of 0.91 between baseline glandular volume and glandular
volume following treatment with  xxxd1701xxx . there was no
statistically significant association between serum ipth
and parathyroid gland size at baseline or at the end of the
study. a summary of the change in sonographic patterns
before and after treatment is reported in table 4.
fifteen glands had a baseline volume <500 mm3 . the
mean volume ± sd of these glands changed significantly
during the course of the study (from 233 ± 115 mm3 at
baseline to 102 ± 132 mm3 ; p = 0.007), with a mean decrease in volume of 68% (figures 3a and 4 and table 4).
at the end of the follow-up period, five glands had become indistinguishable from the thyroid parenchyma, nine
glands had diminished in volume and one gland was enlarged, due to the appearance of an extended anechoic area
within the nodule. moreover, eight glands acquired a hy-

after a 2-week suspension, a rebound of serum ipth levels
occurred in all patients, even in those who had shown major
involutive phenomena and lower values of ipth at the end
of the follow-up. the reintroduction of  xxxd1701xxx  led to
another reduction in serum ipth levels in all patients. the
results of this experiment are given in figure 7.

discussion
phase ii and iii studies have shown that  xxxd1701xxx  successfully lowers serum ipth in mhd patients with shpt,
simultaneously controlling parameters associated with the
ca–p balance [21,22]. long-term studies have given similar
results [30]. an experimental study showed that stabilization of mineral metabolism parameters was accompanied
by a decrease in parathyroid hyperplasia in uraemic rat
models treated with  xxxd1701xxx , with no evidence of increased apoptosis [31]. to date, there has been a lack of
experimental models or studies focused on the effect of
 xxxd1701xxx  on nodular hyperplasia. furthermore, no data
have been published regarding the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on
potential morphological variations in hyperplastic parathyroid glands in ckd patients with severe shpt. clinical
evaluation of shpt is usually carried out by the assessment
of biochemical parameters rather than via morphological
measurements. the aim of this observational study was to
investigate the effects of long-term therapy with  xxxd1701xxx ,
in association with conventional therapy, on the morphology of hyperplastic parathyroid glands.
we show here that  xxxd1701xxx  had a more rapid effect on
the biochemical profile of shpt than on the morphology of
parathyroid glands. changes in volume, vascularization and
sonographic pattern were observed after 12–18 months of
therapy. after this time, we observed a progressive change
in the structural pattern of hyperplastic glands. glands with
a baseline volume ≥500 mm3 had a tendency to show

involutive phenomena, such as anechoic areas of cystic degeneration. this was associated with a decrease in glandular volume in all but one case, where gland size increased.
in glands with a baseline volume <500 mm3 , there were
more significant changes in volume. there was a tendency
for the structural pattern of these glands to change from
hypoechoic (suggesting that they were hyperplastic with a
rich cellularity) to hyperechoic (suggesting that they were
quiescent with an increased number of adipose cells). in the
most significant cases, glands became very small and, like
normal parathyroid glands, were indistinguishable from the
thyroid parenchyma.
we have noted a relationship between major involutive
phenomena and a major reduction in ipth and ca serum
levels, suggesting that a lower dose of  xxxd1701xxx  may have
been used. interestingly, independent of baseline volume,
glands that became hypovascularized following  xxxd1701xxx  treatment inversely reproduced the progression of the
parathyroid gland to hyperplasia (i.e. from a hypovascularized to a hypervascularized pattern).

critical analysis of these data suggests that stabilization
of the biochemical profile of shpt, as well as the involutive phenomena in the glands, was observed only after
the introduction of  xxxd1701xxx  in the therapeutical schema.
these observations suggest that  xxxd1701xxx  is able to modulate the biological response of parathyroid cells in synergy
with vitamin d and phosphate binders. so, the degenerative
effects that are observed during long-term treatment have
to be considered as a result of a combined pharmacological
effect.
cystic degeneration and hypovascularization were evident in glands with diffuse and nodular hyperplasia. physiopathological mechanisms responsible for glandular degeneration are unknown and should be the objective of
further studies. at the moment, findings do not support or
exclude the possibility that glandular degeneration is due to
enhanced apoptosis [32] as well as to an indirect effect of
 xxxd1701xxx  on the vessel tree [33]. nevertheless, it should be
noted that a recent study has reported a pro-apoptotic effect
of  xxxd1701xxx  in glands with nodular hyperplasia excised in
patients not previously treated with phosphate binders or
vitamin d [34].
to determine whether  xxxd1701xxx  could be considered the
trigger of the functional response of hyperplastic glands,
 xxxd1701xxx  therapy was interrupted temporarily in a small
number of patients. after 2 weeks of suspension, serum
ipth levels increased in all patients, even in those who had
the major involutive phenomena. interestingly, the increase
in serum ipth values was smaller as compared with initial pth levels (mean values close to 1200 pg/ml). one
explanation might be that pth secretion was lower after
long-term  xxxd1701xxx  therapy due to a reduction in the number of functional parathyroid cells (mass reduction). these
data, although not definitive, are interesting: they demonstrate the efficacy of the drug on biochemical and functional profiles, but they are contradictory because they do
not demonstrate a clear association between involutive phenomena and a reduction in function of the glands. possible
explanations for this could be linked to the persistence of

glandular cellular masses that are no longer inhibited after
the suspension of the drug or to the possibility that the apparent cellular necrosis is not sufficiently complete to withstand interruption of the drug. furthermore, the response
seen in ipth after discontinuation and reintroduction of
 xxxd1701xxx  suggests that the remnant parathyroid tissue responded to stimulation of the car. these findings confirm
the evidence from pre-clinical studies that show that calcimimetics inhibit parathyroid hyperplasia [35] in subtotally nephrectomized rats [31]. however, it should be noted
that cellular cultures in vitro [36] and the post-5/6 nephrectomy rat model of secondary hpt are not a true reflection
of the progression of nodular hyperplasia in humans [31].
the main limitations of this study were the small number of patients and that data for the control patients were
collected retrospectively. in addition, some analyses were

based on the number of glands, but the changes in gland
volume within a patient are unlikely to be independent, and
this has not been accounted for in the statistical analyses.
in summary, the practical consequences of these preliminary data are the need for a combination of  xxxd1701xxx  with
conventional therapy and also the monitoring of the glandular response with morphological parameters. finally, the
reductions in glandular volume and vascularization, particularly in smaller glands, provide a strong argument for the
early use of  xxxd1701xxx  (and at lower doses) in combination with standard therapy. early ‘pharmacological ptx’,
using  xxxd1701xxx  in combination with conventional therapy,
could reduce the number of patients who eventually require
a surgical ptx.
