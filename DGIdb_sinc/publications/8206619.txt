vascular renin in the guinea pig
suppression by the renin inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx 
karl f. hilgers, walter fischli, roland veelken, johannes f.e. mann
abstract  xxxg99xxx  and ii are generated by the vascular
wall. whether this generation depends on renin or on other
enzymes is debated. we tested the hypothesis that  xxxd3095xxx ,
a highly specific inhibitor of human and guinea pig renin, may
inhibit the vascular renin-angiotensin system. isolated hindquarters from guinea pigs were perfused with an artificial
medium, and  xxxg99xxx  and ii release was measured by
high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. guinea pig hindquarters released  xxxg99xxx  (23.8±5.6
fmol/30 min; n = 13) and  xxxg99xxx  (95.2±19 fmol/30 min;
n=13) spontaneously. inhibition of the  xxxg99xxx -convert-

ing enzyme by captopril (10 nmol/ml) suppressed angiotensin
ii by 85% and increased  xxxg99xxx  by 352% (n=5, p<.05).
infusion of  xxxd3095xxx  (1.6 nmol/ml) in addition to captopril
decreased  xxxg99xxx  release by 68% (p<.05 versus captopril alone, n=5 each). we conclude that renin generates
 xxxg99xxx  in an isolated guinea pig resistance vessel bed.
our study demonstrates that renin rather than nonrenin
enzymes is responsible for the major part of vascular angiotensin formation. (hypertension. 1994;23[part 2]:861-864.)

t

el1-3 for guinea pigs. we investigated whether perfused
guinea pig hindquarters release ang i and ang ii and
tested the effects of ang i-converting enzyme (ace)
inhibition and  xxxd3095xxx . the renin inhibitor was given
in the presence of an a c e inhibitor to increase ang i
formation and hence to sensitize the vasculature to the
inhibitory effects of  xxxd3095xxx .

he notion that  xxxg99xxx  and  xxxg99xxx 
(ang i and ang ii, respectively) are formed in
and released from extrarenal resistance vessels
is now supported by numerous data from studies in
isolated perfused organs.'-4 however, nonrenin enzymes could contribute to the local formation of ang i5'6
in isolated organs perfused without blood, ie, in the
absence of plasma-derived protease inhibitors.
we have recently shown that the natural renin substrate  xxxg99xxx  is cleaved in an isolated, perfused resistance vessel bed.3 these data provide indirect
evidence for the presence of renin in resistance vessels,
since other enzymes would not form ang i from  xxxg99xxx  at ph greater than 7.6 to demonstrate the
presence of vascular renin directly, inhibition of vascular angiotensin formation by specific renin inhibitors is
necessary. saito et al2 have shown that vascular angiotensin formation in rat mesentery can be suppressed by
a derivative of pepstatin that inhibits rat renin. however, concentrations of pepstatin that inhibit rat renin
also inhibit nonspecific proteases such as  xxxg550xxx .6
more specific inhibitors for rat renin are not available.

 xxxd3095xxx  ( xxxd3095xxx ) is a highly specific renin
inhibitor in primates that is 3500 times more potent
against renin than against  xxxg550xxx .7 furthermore,
several in vivo studies suggest that  xxxd3095xxx  inhibits
renin at tissue sites, eg, vascular renin.7-8 therefore,
 xxxd3095xxx  appears to be well suited to investigate vascular renin.  xxxd3095xxx  is not active against rat renin but
is a highly specific inhibitor of guinea pig renin.9
to test the hypothesis that  xxxd3095xxx  inhibits vascular
renin, we adapted our rat hindquarter perfusion modfrom the nephrology division of the department of medicine,
university of erlangen (germany) (k.f.h., r.v., j.f.e.m.); the
department of pharmacology, hoffmann-laroche ag, basel,
switzerland (w.f.); and the nephrology division of the department of medicine, schwabing city hospital, munich, germany

methods
animals
male dunkin-hartley guinea pigs (weight, 300 to 400 g) and
male sprague-dawley rats (weight, 300 to 350 g) were purchased from the zentralinstitut fur versuchstierzucht, hannover, germany. animals were kept in a room at 24±2°c.
guinea pigs were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride
(parke-davis), midazolarri hydrochloride (hoffmann-laroche), and buprenorphine hydrochloride (boehringer mannheim) intraperitoneally; rats were anesthetized with thiobarbitone (byk-gulden) intraperitoneally. all procedures
performed in animals were done in accordance with the
guidelines of the american physiological society and were
approved by the local government (regierung von mittelfranken, az 211-2531.3.a-8/92 and az 211-2531.3.a-7/92).
hindquarter preparation and perfusion
the preparation and perfusion of the isolated rat hindquarter were performed as previously described.110 the same
procedure was adapted for guinea pigs. after evisceration and
preparation of the abdominal aorta and vena cava, an injection
of sodium heparin (500 u iv) was given. five minutes later,
the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava were cannulated, and the perfusion was begun immediately. approximately 20% of eviscerated guinea pigs could not be used for
perfusion experiments because of cannulation problems (eg,
two small instead of one large abdominal vena cava). however,
in the remaining guinea pigs perfusion could be started within
30 seconds after ligation of the aorta, as in rats.1
the hindquarters were perfused in a nonrecirculating system with modified tyrode's solution containing 2 g/l glucose
and 40 g/l of the artificial colloid  xxxd3253xxx  70 (pharmacia). the
perfusate was gassed with o2/co2 (95%/5%), adjusted to ph
7.4, and maintained at 38°c. the hindquarter perfusion was

performed at a constant flow rate (10 ml/min) using a
two-channel peristaltic pump (harvard apparatus). all experimental substances were infused into the perfusion system at a
rate of 30 /xl/min by means of a syringe pump (model 22,
harvard apparatus). all experimental protocols were begun
after an initial perfusion period of 30 minutes (washout
period). samples for measurement of ang i and ii were
collected from the venous cannula.
experimental protocols
to investigate whether angiotensin release from guinea pig
hindquarters was comparable to that from rat hindquarters,
perfusate was collected for 30 minutes from perfused hindquarters of 16 rats and 13 guinea pigs of comparable body
weight. in addition, perfusate was also collected from eight
perfusion channels without hindquarter ("blank" channel) to
exclude a contamination of the perfusion system. to test
whether angiotensin release from guinea pig hind limb was
constant over time, perfusate was collected for three consecutive 30-minute periods from 5 guinea pig hindquarters. to
evaluate the effects of ace inhibition on angiotensin release,
perfusate was collected for two consecutive 30-minute periods
from 10 guinea pig hindquarter preparations. during the
second sampling period, captopril (10 nmol/ml) was infused
to 5 preparations, while the remaining 5 hindquarters received
vehicle (0.9% nacl). the renin inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx  (1 /xg/
ml=1.6 nmol/ml9) was given in addition to captopril during
the second 30-minute sampling period in 5 additional hindquarter preparations.
measurement of  xxxg99xxx  and ii
ods c18 cartridges for peptide extraction were connected
on-line to the vena cava cannula. the on-line connection was
"open" to exclude an increase of venous pressure, and the
effluent was passed through cartridges by means of a second
pump adjusted to the flow rate of the perfusion pump.
peptides were eluted from cartridges as described previously.1
eluates from cartridges were lyophilized, and the dry residues
were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) and subsequent radioimmunoassay (ria) for ang i
and ii as described in detail elsewhere.1-3 for reverse-phase
hplc (gradient pump 2249, pharmacia lkb), samples were
loaded onto a 7-iim nucleosil clg column (macherey nagel &
co), guarded by an ods c18 guard column (guard-pak,
waters assoc), and eluted using a methanol gradient (35% for
10 minutes, then increasing to 80% during a period of 35
minutes) in a 10-mmol/l ammonium acetate buffer, ph 5.4, at
a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a temperature of 40°c. peptides in
hplc fractions were quantified by ria for ang i and ii
(sensitivity, 1 pg per tube). the cross-reactivity of the ang i
antibody was 0.05% for ang ii. the cross-reactivity of the ang
11 antibody was 1% for ang i and 100% for both the ang-(2-8)
heptapeptide (ang iii) and the ang-(3-8) hexapeptide. recovery from sep-pak cartridges and hplc was 71% for ang i
and 92% for ang ii; values shown were corrected for recovery.
statistical analysis
all data are expressed as mean±sem. the significance of
differences was assessed by anova and subsequent newman-keuls test. statistical analysis was performed using a css
statistical software package (statsoft inc). a value of p<.05
was considered significant.

peptides other than ang ii were not detected (fig 2).
the identification of ang i peaks by hplc in guinea pig
samples was more difficult than in rat perfusate1-3
samples because of a higher background immunoreactivity (fig 2). however, when ang i release was increased by ace inhibition, sharp ang i peaks were
detected (fig 2). in some but not all samples from
guinea pig hindquarters, ang i-immunoreactive material eluting 1 to 2 minutes after ang i was detected (data
not shown). the amount of this material was not
sufficient to allow further characterization.
compared with the vehicle control, ace inhibition
with captopril decreased ang ii release significantly by
85.2% (figs 2 and 3). ang ii release was still detectable
(fig 2). captopril induced a significant, 3.5-fold increase of ang i release (figs 2 and 3). the renin
inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx  combined with captopril decreased
ang i release significantly by 67.8% compared with
captopril alone; there was no further reduction of ang
ii release (fig 3).

discussion
this study demonstrates the formation of ang i and
ii in an isolated, skeletal muscle resistance vessel bed of
guinea pigs. the amounts of released ang i and ii were
comparable to angiotensin release from perfused rat
hindquarters.l-3-4 vascular angiotensin formation was
sensitive to ace inhibition.  xxxd3095xxx , a highly specific
inhibitor of human and guinea pig renin,7'9 suppressed
local ang i formation. these data show that renin is
active in the guinea pig resistance vessel bed.
results of measurements of ang i and ii in arterial
and venous plasma in vivo have provided indirect evidence for vascular angiotensin production in several
species, including humans,11'12 pigs,13 sheep,14 rabbits,15
and rats.m angiotensin release from isolated vessels16
and the presence of renin mrna17 in the blood vessel
wall have been demonstrated in human tissue. however,
the bulk of direct evidence for vascular angiotensin
production has been derived from studies in rats. our
results show that there is a vascular production of ang
i and ii in another species, the guinea pig. the suppression of ang i release by  xxxd3095xxx  provides direct
evidence for vascular renin in guinea pig resistance
vessels. the specificity of  xxxd3095xxx  for guinea pig renin
was not tested with  xxxg550xxx  or other proteases from

vascular renin in guinea pigs

the same species. however,  xxxd3095xxx  is 3500-fold more
potent against guinea pig renin than against bovine
 xxxg550xxx .7-9 the observation that bilateral nephrectomy blunts the hypotensive effect of  xxxd3095xxx  in
guinea pigs is also consistent with the notion that this
inhibitor is specific for renin.9
the local formation of ang i was suppressed but not
completely abolished by  xxxd3095xxx . the remaining ang
i generation could be due to an ang i-forming enzyme
other than renin.5 alternatively, the inhibition of vascular renin by  xxxd3095xxx  may have been incomplete, since
we used a rather moderate perfusion dose of  xxxd3095xxx 
(a total of 480 nmol in 300 ml of perfusate given over 30
minutes). generating a dose-response curve for  xxxd3095xxx  in a preparation like ours is probably not
feasible, since  xxxd3095xxx  rapidly accumulates in guinea
pig vascular tissue (w.f., unpublished data, 1993).
perfusion with higher doses might lead to local  xxxd3095xxx  concentrations, which would inhibit nonrenin
enzymes.7 in contrast, this problem could not occur with
the dose used in our study, even if all of the perfused
 xxxd3095xxx  were trapped in the hindquarter.7
our results do not allow us to determine whether
renin and  xxxg99xxx  in guinea pig vessels are
synthesized locally or taken up from plasma. in rats,
synthesis of  xxxg99xxx  within the blood vessel
wall has been demonstrated.18 in contrast, the question
of how much of vascular renin is synthesized localiyi7.19.2o o r taken up from the bloodstream1-3415-21 is still
a matter of debate. kidney-derived renin as a source of
vascular renin activity was not ruled out in our study.
our data provide evidence for the physiological interaction of renin and  xxxg99xxx  within the vasculature to form substantial amounts of ang i, regardless of
whether renin and  xxxg99xxx  may be produced
locally or derived from plasma.
melli and turker22 have estimated rates of ang i
conversion and angiotensin degradation in guinea pig
hindquarter vasculature that closely resemble the respective rates measured in perfused rat hindquarters by
us1 and others. 414 the local formation of ang ii in
guinea pig vessels observed in the present study was
suppressed but not completely abolished by captopril, in
contrast to previous studies in rats.1 since we did not
use higher doses of captopril, we cannot exclude the
possibility that other concentrations of the drug are
required in guinea pigs than in rats. the part of ang ii
formation that was resistant to ace inhibition could
also be due to cleavage of ang i by a chymaselike
enzyme, which is absent in rats,23 or to nonrenin enzymes that cleave ang ii from  xxxg99xxx .5 we are
not aware of any report addressing these enzymes in the
guinea pig. however, the similarity of the hemodynamic
effects of renin inhibition, ace inhibition, and ang ii
receptor blockade in guinea pigs9-24 argues against a
major role for nonrenin or chymaselike enzymes.
previous studies suggested that  xxxd3095xxx  may exert
its effects on blood pressure by inhibiting renin at tissue
sites, eg, the vascular wall. in normotensive primates,
the effects on blood pressure are much more prolonged
than those on plasma renin.7 furthermore, in cyclosporine-induced hypertensive monkeys,  xxxd3095xxx  but not
renin-neutralizing antibodies reduced blood pressure,
even though both interventions led to dramatic reductions in plasma ang ii.8 our results support these

previous studies by providing direct evidence for inhibition of vascular renin by  xxxd3095xxx .
in summary, our data show that a functional reninangiotensin system is active in the blood vessel wall of
guinea pigs. since vascular angiotensin formation can be
suppressed by  xxxd3095xxx , our results support the notion
that renin rather than nonrenin angiotensin-forming
enzymes mediates vascular angiotensin production. in
light of the results of previous in vivo studies,  xxxd3095xxx 
may be a valuable tool to investigate the relative contribution of tissue renin-angiotensin systems in models
of hypertension.
note added in proof. the present data and our previous results3 clearly invalidate recently published assumptions that vascular angiotensin formation in isolated perfused tissues may be due to lysosomal
proteases rather than renin.25
