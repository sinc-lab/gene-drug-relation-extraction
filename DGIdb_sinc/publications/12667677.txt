abstract
the use of the immulite automated immunoassay system is becoming an increasingly popular method for accurate and fast
measurement of sil-2r in serum. here, we report that detection of sil-2r using the immulite immunoassay system in serum
samples of patients who are treated with  xxxd286xxx , a monoclonal antibody against the alpha-chain of the  xxxg1175xxx , may
lead to false measurements.

1. text
the clinical relevance of sil-2r measurements
using the immulite immunoassay system (diagnostic
products, los angeles, ca, usa) has been studied in
patients with ovarian tumors (gebauer et al., 1999),
anterior uveitis (huhtinen et al., 2002) and bell’s
palsy (yilmaz et al., 2002). in a previous study, we
used the immulite system for daily monitoring during
the early course after liver transplantation in order to
evaluate the clinical relevance of sil-2r in serum as
an early marker of acute liver graft rejection (warlé et
al., 2003). furthermore, sil-2r measurements may be
useful in the monitoring of patients treated with
abbreviations: sil-2r, soluble interleukin-2 receptor.

monoclonal antibodies against the  xxxg1175xxx , since
a decrease in the serum level of sil-2r has been
found to parallel the reappearance of cd25 positive t
lymphocytes (ter meulen et al., 2001).
recent clinical studies have shown that treatment
with  xxxd286xxx  ( xxxd286xxx , novartis pharmaceuticals,
basel, switzerland) reduces the incidence of acute
rejection after solid organ transplantation (calmus et
al., 2002).  xxxd286xxx  is a human/murine chimeric
monoclonal antibody against the alpha-chain of the
 xxxg1175xxx  (cd25) and has also been used successfully in the treatment of patients with psoriasis (owen
et al., 2000), epidermolysis bullosa acquisata (haufs
and haneke, 2001) and severe atopic dermatitis (kagi
and heyer, 2001). since the sil-2r detection antibody of the immulite immunoassay system and  xxxd286xxx  are both directed against the alpha-chain of
the  xxxg1175xxx , measurement of sil-2r may be
disturbed in patients who receive  xxxd286xxx . to

conventional cyclosporin-based immunosuppressive regimen without  xxxd286xxx  (o). the error bars indicate standard errors of the mean.

study this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of
 xxxd286xxx  in serum samples of liver transplant
patients with regard to sil-2r measurement by the
immulite immunoassay system.
serum samples of 45 liver transplant patients were
monitored daily for sil-2r by the immulite system
during the first postoperative month. twenty-three
patients received  xxxd286xxx  at postoperative day 0
(within 6 h after transplantation) and at day 4 in
addition to a conventional cyclosporin-based immunosuppressive regimen. fig. 1 shows that patients
treated with  xxxd286xxx  displayed significantly lower
levels of sil-2r from postoperative days 1 to 10 as
compared to patients who received an immunosup-

pressive regimen without  xxxd286xxx . furthermore, in
the  xxxd286xxx  group, sil-2r levels were significantly lower at postoperative day 5 as compared to
day 4. this clearly indicates that lower levels of sil2r measured by the immulite immunoassay system
were due to the administration of  xxxd286xxx  at postoperative day 4. fig. 2 shows that  xxxd286xxx  levels
(measured at novartis pharmaceuticals) increased
after the second administration on postoperative day
4 and then slowly decreased to levels below cd25
saturating concentrations (0.2 ag/ml) on postoperative
day 28. the clearance of  xxxd286xxx  in serum paralleled the gradual increase of sil-2r levels up to
postoperative day 21 as shown in fig. 1. in patients

fig. 2.  xxxd286xxx  serum concentrations at postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 of 23 liver transplant patients who received  xxxd286xxx  on
postoperative day 0 (within 6 h after transplantation) and also on day 4. the error bars indicate standard error of the mean.

fig. 3. soluble  xxxg1175xxx  was measured in two serum samples of liver transplant patients (. and n) and two phosphate-buffered solutions with high
(o) and low (5) sil-2r concentrations with different concentrations of  xxxd286xxx  (range 0 – 100 ag/ml).

treated with  xxxd286xxx , sil-2r levels from postoperative days 17 to 28 were significantly higher as
compared to patients not receiving  xxxd286xxx  (fig.
1). this phenomenon might be explained by delayed
clearance of sil-2r and/or increased shedding of
cd25 from t lymphocytes as a consequence of
saturating levels of  xxxd286xxx  during the first month
after liver transplantation.
to investigate whether the murine sil-2r detection antibody of the immulite immunoassay system
and the human/murine chimeric cd25 monoclonal
antibody ( xxxd286xxx ) competitively bind to the il-2
receptor alpha-chain, we performed recovery experiments. for this purpose, different concentrations of
 xxxd286xxx  (range 0.025 –100 ag/ml) were added to
serum samples of liver transplant patients who did
not receive  xxxd286xxx  and to spiked phosphatebuffered solutions with known sil-2r concentrations. fig. 3 shows an inverse correlation between
 xxxd286xxx  concentrations and the level of sil-2r
detected in serum samples of two liver transplant
patients and two phosphate-buffered solutions with
high and low sil-2r concentrations, respectively.
the characteristic sigmoidal curves as displayed in
fig. 3 indicate that  xxxd286xxx  and the  xxxg1175xxx  detection antibody competitively bind to the alpha-chain of
the  xxxg1175xxx .
kovarik et al. (1997) showed that  xxxd286xxx 
serum concentrations of 0.2 ag/ml are sufficient to
saturate  xxxg1175xxx  epitopes on circulating t lymphocytes.
at a dose of 40 mg, patients had serum concentrations
above this threshold for 4 to 6 weeks. our data show

that the recovery of sil-2r was obviously reduced at
a  xxxd286xxx  concentration of 0.2 ag/ml (fig. 3).
therefore, we conclude that the use of the immulite
immunoassay for soluble  xxxg1175xxx  measurements
leads to erroneous data during treatment with  xxxd286xxx .
