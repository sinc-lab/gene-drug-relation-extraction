introduction

gaucher disease (gd) is a progressive lysosomal storage disorder due to an autosomal recessive deficiency of
glucocerebrosidase, associated with the pathologic accumulation of glucosylceramide in cells of the monocyte/
macrophage lineage [1]. clinical manifestations include
anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone
and pulmonary disease, and in some cases, neuronopathic manifestations (types 2 and 3 gd) [2].
recent advances have led to target-population
screening programs and the identification and provision of appropriate genetic counseling to carrier couples at risk of having affected children. identification

obsolete the reactive, solely palliative approach of an
earlier era. the recent introduction of substrate
reduction therapy, an approach that also directly
targets the biochemical storage process, as well as
ongoing clinical investigation of adjunctive treatments (e.g., bisphosphonates for patients with gd
and severe osteopenia), offer the promise of greater
therapeutic flexibility and optimal, individualized
patient care.
this communication represents the current opinion
of some leading american experts in the field, regarding an approach to the management of gd patients
in the context of the availability of enzyme therapy
and the recent introduction of substrate reduction
therapy.
enzyme replacement therapy

enzyme replacement therapy (ert) for non-neuronopathic type 1 gaucher disease has been available
since 1991, initially, as human placenta-derived alglucerase (ceredaseò, genzyme corporation, cambridge, ma) and since 1994 in a recombinant
formulation,  xxxd2336xxx  (cerezymeò, genzyme
corporation) [3]. more than 3,500 patients worldwide
have been treated with alglucerase or  xxxd2336xxx 
with well-documented beneficial effects on the hematological, visceral, skeletal, and pulmonary manifestations and with resultant improvement in the patients’
health-related quality of life. however, ert is not a
sufficient treatment for the neuronopathic manifestations in patients with type 2 or 3 gd, although systemic disease signs do improve [4].
adequate and uninterrupted treatment with  xxxd2336xxx  enables the achievement and maintenance of
normal or better physical and functional well-being
among patients with type 1 gd, with improvements
in the clinical manifestations of the disease [5]. these
observations have been noted in both children and
adult patients with a variety of disease presentations.
analysis of clinical response data on 1,028 patients in
the registry program treated with ert for 2–5 years
revealed that individuals with anemia achieved normal or near normal hemoglobin values after 6–12
months of treatment, with further improvements
achieved over the next 4 years [6]. platelet counts
usually doubled or reached normal values within 24
months of therapy, with further improvements occurring in the following 3 years [6]. hepatomegaly typically decreased by 20–30% from baseline (i.e.,
pretreatment) measurements after 1–2 years of ert
and by 30–40% after 5 years [6]. splenomegaly typically decreased by 30% within the first year, with
reductions of 50% or more from baseline observed
after 2 years [6].

skeletal improvements included resolution of
chronic bone pain within 1–2 years in more than
50% of patients who were symptomatic before starting ert [6]. in patients with a history of acute bone
crises, 82% had resolution of these episodes after 1
year of ert and 94% had resolution after 2 years [6].
incomplete responses in the patients with more
advanced disease reflect the irreversible nature of
some complications (e.g., fibrotic and necrotic tissue
damage) and highlight the importance of initiating
treatment early.
ert with  xxxd2336xxx  is generally well tolerated
with few adverse effects. the most common side
effect is the development of igg antibodies in
approximately 15% of the treated patients [7].
approximately 8% of the patients who seroconvert
develop mild to moderate infusion-associated reactions. these symptoms are usually well managed
with slower infusion rates and pretreatment with antipyretics and/or antihistamines. the excellent safety
profile of  xxxd2336xxx  has enabled the initiation of
patient self-administration (i.e., home-based infusions) [8]. worldwide compliance with the intravenous administration of  xxxd2336xxx  remains high at
91.1%.
these safety and effectiveness outcomes have
established intravenous administered ert as the
accepted standard for treatment of symptomatic
patients with type 1 gd.
substrate reduction therapy

 xxxd2645xxx  (zavescaò; actelion ltd, basel, switzerland), a new, oral treatment for patients with type 1
gd, was recently approved in europe and the united
states for certain indications (e.g., patients unable to
receive ert because of poor venous access or allergy
to the enzyme as reconstituted for injection).  xxxd2645xxx  is an imino sugar that reversibly inhibits
 xxxg2376xxx , the ceramide-specific
glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of
glucocerebroside and thereby initiates the glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway [9]. it is postulated that
a reduction in substrate burden, in conjunction with
the attenuated, native glucocerebrosidase activity
typically found in patients with type 1 gd, will
decrease tissue storage of glucosylceramide. in 1994,
proof of concept for this approach, commonly
referred to as ‘‘substrate reduction therapy’’ (srt)
and first proposed by radin in 1982 [10], was demonstrated using  xxxd2645xxx  in an in vitro model of gaucher disease [11]. other small-molecule inhibitors of
 xxxg2376xxx  with greater specificity and
potency have also been shown to be effective in reducing stored substrate in vitro and in animal models of

lysosomal storage diseases [12], but to date  xxxd2645xxx 
is the only compound that has been evaluated in
human clinical trials and shown to have some effect
on visceral, biochemical, and, to a lesser extent,
hematological abnormalities in patients with type 1
gd [13].
regulatory approval of  xxxd2645xxx  by the european
agency for the evaluation of medicinal products
(emea) was granted in 2002 and later by the united
states food and drug administration (fda). the
approved indication for  xxxd2645xxx  is limited to symptomatic patients with mild to moderate type 1 gd for
whom ert is unsuitable (emea) [14] or ert is not
an option (fda) [15].
the emea and fda also add the following
caveats:
.  xxxd2645xxx  has not been studied and is therefore not
recommended for children (<18 years old) or elderly
patients (emea, >70 years old; fda, >65 years
old).
.  xxxd2645xxx  is contraindicated in pregnancy, in anticipation of pregnancy, in men wishing to have children, and with breast feeding.
.  xxxd2645xxx  may be dangerous for patients with renal
impairment.
.  xxxd2645xxx  should be prescribed only by physicians
knowledgeable in the management of patients with
gd.
following emea approval of  xxxd2645xxx , the european advisory council consisting of leading experts
in the field, and working under the auspices of the
european working group on gaucher disease
(ewgdd) published recommendations on the role
of  xxxd2645xxx  in the treatment of type 1 gd [16]. this
consensus report emphasized that the cost of  xxxd2336xxx  should not be a consideration in determining
patient eligibility for  xxxd2645xxx .

clinical trial 1: study  xxxd2645xxx -001 and extension
study  xxxd2645xxx -001x [13–15,17,18]

twenty-eight patients who were unable or unwilling to receive ert participated in this open-label,
noncomparative, safety-and-efficacy trial of  xxxd2645xxx 
given orally (po) at 100 mg three times daily (tid)
[13]. the primary efficacy variables were percent
change in volume for spleen and liver, and the actual
change from baseline for hemoglobin and platelets.
after 12 months of treatment, liver volumes (n ¼ 17)
decreased by 14% and spleen volumes (n ¼ 14)
decreased by 22% [13]. a nonsignificant ‘‘upward
trend’’ was seen in hematologic variables (table i)
[13] six patients discontinued from this study: one
due to a serious adverse event (sae) [peripheral neuropathy], two because of diarrhea, and three for reasons unrelated to the medication.
eighteen patients participated in the extension trial.
a reduction in hepatosplenomegaly was observed at 24
months, and, to a lesser extent, at 36 months [14,15,17].
the small increments in hemoglobin concentration and
platelet count were maintained (table i). from months
6 to 24, there was statistically significant mean percent
decrease in  xxxg444xxx  activity. four of the 18
patients withdrew during the extension phase: two
because of diarrhea and two as a ‘‘precaution’’ (concerns regarding peripheral neuropathy led one of the
investigators to withdraw treatment of study patients
at his site).
a recent report provides an update on 14 of the
patients in the trial who completed 36 months of
treatment with  xxxd2645xxx  [18].
liver and spleen volumes were reduced by 18%

 xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy require close monitoring as
‘‘ xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy may not be sufficient to
maintain the same control of disease activity in all
patients’’ [14].

clinical trial 2: study  xxxd2645xxx -003 and extension
study  xxxd2645xxx -003x [19]

clinical safety and efficacy profile

the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a lower dose of  xxxd2645xxx , at 50 mg po tid,
and to ascertain the relative incidence of adverse
events compared with the higher dose used in study
001. the sample size for study 003 was 18 patients,
and the duration of the initial and extension phase
was 6 months each. at the lower dose, efficacy was
reduced compared to that noted in the 001 study, but
the adverse event profile did not improve.
clinical trial 3:  xxxd2645xxx -004 and extension
study  xxxd2645xxx -004x [17]

study 3 was an open-label, 6-month trial designed
to examine the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2645xxx  as a
maintenance treatment, either in combination with
ert or as monotherapy. patients who had received
ert for a minimum of 2 years, and in whom serial
organ volume measurements, hematological parameters, and biochemical markers were consistent
with stabilized disease, were eligible for randomization to one of three arms:  xxxd2336xxx  monotherapy,
 xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy at 100 mg po tid, or combined  xxxd2336xxx  and  xxxd2645xxx  therapy. the mean
duration of prior ert for the study population was
5.8 years. thirty-six patients, 12 per study arm, were
randomized. twenty-nine patients completed the
study.
there were no significant differences among the
three treatment groups in the mean absolute changes
in liver and spleen volume and hemoglobin concentration after 6 months. however, the  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy group had a 33% increase in mean
 xxxg444xxx  activity when compared to both the
 xxxd2336xxx  monotherapy and combination groups
in whom the biomarker levels were unchanged. additionally, the  xxxd2645xxx  group experienced a mean
decrease in platelet count of 21.6  109/l while the
group maintained on  xxxd2336xxx  alone, had a mean
increase in platelet count of 10.1  109/l.
during a 6-month further extension of this trial
(study  xxxd2645xxx -004x), ert was discontinued in all
patients who were then maintained solely on  xxxd2645xxx  at 100 mg po tid. during this phase, mean
platelet counts decreased and  xxxg444xxx  activity
increased, although no significant changes were seen

clinical safety profile

a number of adverse events were reported in the
clinical studies of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with type 1
gd. some of these side effects appeared to be reversible with discontinuation of  xxxd2645xxx . in other cases,
the cause and prognosis of the adverse events
observed was less certain.
gastrointestinal symptoms were common in the
 xxxd2645xxx  clinical trials. diarrhea requiring the
administration of antidiarrheal medication and
weight loss (6% from baseline) were reported in
89% patients during the first year of clinical trial i
and were no lower in the ‘‘low-dose’’ study [14,17,19].
in addition to inhibition of glucosylceramide
synthase,  xxxd2645xxx  inhibits the intestinal disaccharidases sucrase and  xxxg1401xxx , resulting in a high potential for osmotic diarrhea. however, the diarrhea
usually decreases with continued use of  xxxd2645xxx ,
often without dose reduction, and rarely justifies discontinuation of  xxxd2645xxx . the cause of weight loss is
not known, but most patients recover lost weight by
24 months of treatment.
there continues to be concern as to whether and to
what extent  xxxd2645xxx  treatment is associated with
adverse effects on the nervous system. onset of
impaired cognitive function was reported in 5
patients, but careful expert review failed to establish
a causal relationship. in the clinical trials, tremor or
exaggeration of an existing tremor was reported in
30% of the patients. the tremor is reported to be
analogous to the sympathetic tremor observed with
excessive caffeine intake, and usually resolved either
spontaneously, after dose reduction, or with withdrawal of  xxxd2645xxx . paresthesias and burning sensations
consistent with peripheral neuropathy occurred in
15–20% of the patients, but these were usually reversible after dosage adjustment or treatment discontinuation. it is acknowledged that there is a paucity of
information about the frequency of the above neurological abnormalities in untreated patients with type 1
gd and that more studies are required.
concerns for potential neurotoxicity following the
use of  xxxd2645xxx  have been expressed by both the
emea and fda. the emea recommended that
‘‘all patients should therefore undergo baseline and
repeat neurological and cognitive functions evalua-

concise review:  xxxd2645xxx  for type 1 gaucher disease

tions. patients who develop symptoms should have a
careful re-assessment of risk/benefit and may require
cessation of treatment.’’ with respect to tremor, the
final fda label states that ‘‘dose reduction may ameliorate the tremor usually within days but discontinuation of treatment may sometimes be required.’’
the fda label also contains a warning that ‘‘patients
who develop symptoms such as numbness and tingling should have careful re-assessment of the risk/
benefit of zavescaò ( xxxd2645xxx ) therapy and cessation
of treatment may be considered.’’
in animal studies,  xxxd2645xxx  was shown to cause
fetal and maternal death at doses as low as twice
that of the human equivalent. male rats experienced
infertility via adverse effects on spermatogenesis. for
these reasons,  xxxd2645xxx  is contraindicated in women
who are or who may become pregnant, and males
should maintain reliable methods of contraception
while on  xxxd2645xxx .
as a condition of the emea and fda approval of
 xxxd2645xxx , actelion ltd is required to institute a
long-term pharmacovigilance (or monitoring) program, the success of which will be largely dependent
on input from physician-observers with sufficient
experience and expertise to recognize significant
safety concerns and who can be able to distinguish
unusual drug effects from the natural phenomena
associated with gd.
clinical efficacy profile

the clinical response obtained with the use of
 xxxd2645xxx  in patients with type 1 gd appears to be
less than that reported with the use of  xxxd2336xxx 
(table ii). improvement in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count was absent or minimal and
took longer to achieve when compared to patients
receiving  xxxd2336xxx . reductions in liver and spleen
volumes were also less when compared to those
achieved with  xxxd2336xxx . additionally, platelet
counts were noted to decrease and  xxxg444xxx 
values increased in patients receiving maintenance
treatment with  xxxd2645xxx  alone, at least during the

summary of statements from
the european, united states,
and canadian regulatory authorities

the european regulatory authority emphasized
that ‘‘the benefit/risk profile of [ xxxd2645xxx ] was acceptable only for a small subset of patients with type 1
gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy was unsuitable, as assessed by physicians knowledgeable in the treatment of patients with this
disease.’’ the emea further specified that  xxxd2645xxx 
may not offer any efficacy advantage over  xxxd2336xxx  and that the results of clinical trials with  xxxd2645xxx 
suggested that it is less effective in suppressing disease
activity in patients stabilized on  xxxd2336xxx .
furthermore,  xxxd2645xxx  has not been studied in patients
younger than 18 years or older than 70 years, and no
evaluation has been conducted with  xxxd2645xxx  in
patients with severe gd (i.e., hb < 9 g/dl or plt <
50  109/l, or those at risk of developing new bone
complications).
in october 2003, the fda granted approval for the
use of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with type 1 gd. approval
was granted with an indication limited to adult
patients with mild to moderate type 1 gd in whom
ert is not an option (e.g., due to allergic hypersensitivity to  xxxd2336xxx  or lack of venous access). the
package insert includes a warning regarding the
potential of neurological side effects and emphasizes
the need for appropriate monitoring of treated
patients. furthermore, prescription of  xxxd2645xxx  is
restricted only to physicians who are knowledgeable
in the management of patients with gd.
based on its review of both published and unpublished
data, the canadian expert drug advisory committee
(cedac), on 24 november 2004, made its final recommendation that  xxxd2645xxx  not be listed as a therapeutic
option for canadian patients with gd [21]. cedac
concluded that there was insufficient evidence that
 xxxd2645xxx  has a clinically meaningful impact on the key
hematologic and bone complications and that there is
insufficient evidence to show whether treatment reduces
fatigue, bone pain, bone complications, or blood product transfusion requirements. the committee expressed
concern as to the adequacy of patient follow up with
respect to the commonly observed initial side effects of
diarrhea and weight loss, and recommended further controlled studies regarding neuropathy. furthermore, they
noted that ‘‘the current standard of care when enzyme

228

concise review: weinreb et al.

replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option includes
analgesics, transfusions, bone marrow transplants, and
measures to prevent or treat fractures and infections.’’ (it
should be pointed out, however, that  xxxd2645xxx  has never
been studied or proposed as treatment for patients with
gd of such severity that the patients require repeated
blood product transfusions or that they must be candidates for bone marrow transplantation in the absence of
an ert option.) the clinical benefit of  xxxd2645xxx  over
best supportive therapy to improve quality of life and
prevent serious complications must be better supported
by valid scientific evidence to justify the estimated cost of
$118,700 (canadian) per patient per year.’’

recommendations

the united states and european regulatory agencies have suggested that a small patient population
exists for whom  xxxd2645xxx  may be appropriately prescribed. based on a review of the available data and
our clinical experience in managing patients with gd,
we offer the following guidance and recommendations:
1. enzyme replacement therapy with  xxxd2336xxx  is
the current standard of care worldwide and is the
preferred treatment for symptomatic patients with
type 1 gd. after more than 10 years of clinical
experience with  xxxd2336xxx , treatment compliance is 91.1% and the safety and efficacy profile
continues to be excellent. early and adequate
treatment with  xxxd2336xxx  can restore physical
and functional well-being, and prevent the morbidity associated with untreated progressive disease.
2. use of  xxxd2645xxx  should be limited to patients for
whom ert is not a therapeutic option. this
includes the rare cases of allergy or hypersensitivity
to  xxxd2336xxx  which cannot be managed medically, or those in whom venous access is not possible
even via an infus-a-port or similar device. clinical
decisions by physicians on the treatment of patients
with gd should not be based on lifestyle or convenience issues. inappropriate substitution of  xxxd2645xxx  for  xxxd2336xxx  has the potential for adverse,
possibly irreversible consequences, particularly as
regards skeletal complications regarding which the
effect of  xxxd2645xxx  is still not fully established.
3. use of  xxxd2645xxx  has been associated with several side
effects, although in some cases the causal nature of the
relationship has not been clearly established. in the
 xxxd2645xxx  clinical studies, up to 30% of patients
experienced tremor, up to 20% experienced paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies, up to 85%
experienced diarrhea, and up to 65% experienced
weight loss. furthermore, males may experience

5.

infertility due to abnormal spermatogenesis. when
recommending  xxxd2645xxx  treatment, the physician
must clearly delineate the spectrum of potential
adverse side effects as part of the informed consent
process.
thus, patients treated with  xxxd2645xxx  should be carefully monitored, as the full side effect profile is not yet
known. at least 80 patients with gd received  xxxd2645xxx  in the clinical studies prior to regulatory
approvals. given the frequent rate of neurologic
adverse events (about 30%) reported, the fdaapproved label for  xxxd2645xxx  includes a warning
that ‘‘all patients undergoing zavescaò treatment
should undergo baseline and repeat neurological
evaluations at approximately 6-month intervals.’’
in light of these events, we recommend that all
patients with gaucher disease, regardless of their
treatment status, continue to be monitored regularly
following a schedule such as that advocated by the
international collaborative gaucher group
(icgg) [22].
patients who have been treated with  xxxd2336xxx 
should not be switched to  xxxd2645xxx , except for the
indications noted above.
 xxxd2645xxx  should not be used in combination with
 xxxd2336xxx  except in an approved clinical trial.
there is limited evidence to support the use of
 xxxd2645xxx  in combination with ert. this opinion
is in agreement with the fda, which has concluded
that ‘‘...there are insufficient data to support its use
as add-on therapy for ert, either to enhance control of the disease or to spare ert dose.’’
 xxxd2645xxx  should not be used in children under 18 or
adults over 65, in accordance with the fda-approved
label.  xxxd2645xxx  inhibits the synthesis of many glycosphingolipids, which are essential components of the
developing nervous system.
 xxxd2645xxx  should be used only by physicians who have
expertise in the care of patients with gaucher disease.
managing a rare multisystem genetic disease is a
complex endeavor. the fda approval of  xxxd2645xxx 
strictly limits its use to ‘‘physicians knowledgeable in
the management of patients with gaucher disease.’’
regardless of treatment status, we believe that all
patients with gaucher disease can benefit from periodic evaluations at dedicated, multidisciplinary
gaucher disease centers.
