abstract: for more than 20 years, tamoxifen has been the gold standard for the adjuvant
treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer. however,
recent randomized trials have shown efﬁcacy and tolerability beneﬁts with the third-generation
aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, resulting in an increased use of this agent in the adjuvant
setting. data on anastrozole’s long-term efﬁcacy and tolerability are therefore of interest in
clinical practice and will be reviewed here, especially in the light of the 100-month analysis of
the atac (anastrozole, tamoxifen alone or in combination) trial.

breast cancer is the single most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide and
a leading cause of cancer-related death. in western countries, nearly 75% of all breast
cancers occur in postmenopausal women, of which about 80% are hormone-receptor
positive. a recent retrospective analysis of 3614 postmenopausal patients with estrogen
receptor-positive (er+) early breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen revealed
that 476 (13.2%) had developed a recurrence during the 5-year median follow-up.1
the annual hazard ratio (hr) of recurrence peaked at 2 years (4.3% per annum); the
majority of this peak represented distant recurrence. in another retrospective cohort
study of us patients (n = 1616) with early breast cancer, the risk of dying was found
to be over 3 times greater for patients with distant recurrence as compared with locoregional or contralateral recurrence.2
given the potential adverse impact on overall survival associated with recurrence,
adjuvant therapies that reduce the risk of early distant metastasis are also most likely
to have a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect on overall survival. tamoxifen has been for a
long time the adjuvant treatment of choice for pre- and postmenopausal women with
 xxxg1603xxx  positive early breast cancer. the results of the oxford meta-analyses3,4
have demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction in both disease recurrence (41%) and breast
cancer speciﬁc mortality (34%) for patients treated with 5 years of tamoxifen therapy.
although most of the divergence between treatments in disease recurrence occurs
during the ﬁrst 5 years on treatment, the effect on breast cancer speciﬁc mortality is not
manifest until the period between 5 and 15 years. the relapse pattern for low-risk and
intermediate risk tumors indicates that there is a 1.5% to 2% yearly risk of recurrence
of breast cancer in years 5 to 15 after initial diagnosis. a small proportion of women
treated with tamoxifen experience serious side effects including increased incidence
of endometrial cancer, thromboembolism and cerebrovascular events, which limits
the long-term use of tamoxifen. recent data from the atac (arimidex, tamoxifen,

alone or in combination)5 and big (breast international
group)1–986 clinical trials demonstrate that third-generation
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (ais) anastrozole and
letrozole are, respectively, more effective than tamoxifen in
reducing recurrences and also offer tolerability advantages
over tamoxifen. a technology assessment from the american
society of clinical oncology (asco)7 recommends that the
optimum adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with
hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer should include the
use of an ai, either as initial treatment or sequentially after
2 to 5 years treatment with tamoxifen. considerable debate
remains over the most effective treatment strategy (upfront or
sequential) and the extent to which beneﬁts and side effects
continue after treatment is completed.
in this report we review the 100-month analysis of
the atac trial,8 which provides long-term efﬁcacy and
safety data on anastrozole compared with tamoxifen as
initial adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with
hormone-sensitive breast cancer. similarly the combined
analyses of data from two prospective, multicenter, randomized, open label trials (abcsg trial 8 and arno 95)
lend support to a switch from tamoxifen to anastrozole in
patients who have completed 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.9
the results of the italian tamoxifen anastrozole trial (ita
trial)10 also conﬁrm that switching to anastrozole after the ﬁrst
2 to 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen is well tolerated and
signiﬁcantly improves event-free and recurrence-free survival in postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer.

pharmacology
the basic pharmacological differences between tamoxifen
and anastrozole explain their mode of action, varied side
effect proﬁle and efﬁcacy.
tamoxifen is a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator
(serm), which affects different organ systems including
the endometrium (endometrial cancer and hypertrophy),
the coagulation system (thrombosis), bone (modulation
of mineral density) and liver (alterations of blood lipid
proﬁle). in these organ systems tamoxifen generally acts as
an agonist, mimicking the effect of estrogen, in contrast to
its action on breast epithelial cells, where it generally acts
as an antagonist.11 flare reactions, withdrawal responses,
and the experimental demonstration of breast tumor growth
stimulated by tamoxifen are evidence that tamoxifen
can operate as an agonist in breast tissue under certain
circumstances. tamoxifen treatment is usually limited to
5 years because of concerns on the development of de novo
and acquired resistance, and an ongoing risk of adverse

events, including endometrial cancer, thromboembolic
events, and gynecological symptoms with long-term use.
the therapeutic option of reducing estrogen levels in
patients with breast cancer was originally restricted to
patients with functioning ovaries. however, postmenopausal
women still produce signiﬁcant amounts of estrogen through
aromatization of circulating adrenal androgens in peripheral
normal tissues, such as fat, muscle, liver, and the epithelial and
stromal components of the breast.11 the relative proportion
of estrogens synthesized in extragonadal sites increases with
age, and eventually non-ovarian estrogens predominate in the
circulation. the pivotal role of aromatase in the development
of breast cancer led to the successful introduction into
clinical practice of potent and speciﬁc ais. anastrozole is a
competitive ai with high potency and was the ﬁrst selective
ai approved in north america and europe. pharmacodynamic
studies reveal that subjects receiving anastrozole 1 mg per day
orally achieved 96.7% aromatase inhibition.11

efficacy
the atac trialists group8 published in 2008 the ﬁndings
of an analysis of data at a median follow-up of 100 months
(range 0–126), which is the longest follow-up to date of
an adjuvant trial of upfront treatment with ais. in atac,
9366 postmenopausal women with localized invasive breast
cancer treated with surgery ± radiotherapy ± chemotherapy
were randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to anastrozole (n = 3125),
tamoxifen (n = 3116) or a combination of anastrozole and
tamoxifen (n = 3125). the combination treatment arm was
discontinued after interim analysis because it showed no efﬁcacy or tolerability beneﬁts over tamoxifen alone. the primary
end point of the trial was disease-free survival (dfs) deﬁned
as the time from randomization to the earliest occurrence of
local or distant recurrence, new primary breast cancer, or
death from any cause, and the secondary endpoints included
time to recurrence (ttr), incidence of new contralateral
breast cancer (clbc), time to distant recurrence (ttdr),
overall survival (os) and death after recurrence. the primary
and secondary end points were assessed in the total population
(intention to treat; itt: anastrozole, n = 3125; tamoxifen,
n = 3116: total 6241) and the  xxxg1603xxx  positive
subpopulation (84% of itt: anastrozole, n = 2618; tamoxifen,
n = 2598; total 5216). post-treatment completion, fractures
and serious adverse events continued to be collected blindly.
a total of 46202 women-years of follow-up for patients
receiving monotherapy were included in this trial.
the results of this trial show that at median follow-up of
100 months, dfs, ttr, ttdr, and the incidence of new

anastrozole for early breast cancer

clbc were improved signiﬁcantly in the intention to treat and
hormone-receptor-positive populations in women assigned
anastrozole compared to tamoxifen (table 1). lower recurrence rates for anastrozole were maintained after treatment
completion, especially for the hormone-receptor-positive
population where the absolute beneﬁt of 2.8% at 5 years
increased to 4.8% at 9 years (figure 1).
the improvement in disease control with anastrozole
was maintained beyond 8 years and the graphs continued
to diverge even at 9 years, suggesting that the therapeutic
effect of 5 years’ treatment with ais can be prolonged
after treatment cessation. the early breast cancer trialists
collaborative group (ebctcg) showed a carryover effect
for 5 years’ treatment with tamoxifen, with decreased
recurrence rates maintained after cessation of treatment in
years 5 to 9.4 therefore, given the long-term ﬁndings from

the atac trial, anastrozole might have a larger carryover
effect after cessation of treatment than tamoxifen, which may
have a signiﬁcant impact on clinical practice. the additional
signiﬁcant reduction in recurrence noted with anastrozole
compared with tamoxifen after completion of treatment
suggests that anastrozole would decrease recurrence by 50%
in the post-treatment period compared with no treatment.
the hazard ratio for recurrence favored anastrozole for all
subgroups based on baseline and treatment characteristics.
the benefit in favor of anastrozole was larger for the
subgroup of estrogen-receptor-positive and progesteronereceptor-negative compared to estrogen-receptor-positive
and progesterone-receptor-positive subgroup (p = 0.001).
however, this ﬁnding according to  xxxg1737xxx 
status has not been confirmed either in a similar trial
comparing letrozole with tamoxifen12 or by the trans-atac

the distant recurrence rates also continued to diverge
over longer follow-up intervals, being 1.3% lower for anastrozole compared with tamoxifen at year 5 and 2.4% lower
at year 9. similarly a lower number of recurrences of new
contra-lateral breast cancers after anastrozole compared with
tamoxifen were also maintained in the latest ﬁndings from
the atac trial.

however, despite the above ﬁndings, no differences were
noted in overall survival. the reasons for this are not entirely
clear but may partly be because of an excess of deaths from
other causes without recurrence (although not statistically
signiﬁcant, about 44% of total deaths in the anastrozole group
and 39% in the tamoxifen group were non-breast cancer
deaths). the other important factor to be noted is that the
mean age at last follow-up was 72 years in this analysis. the
risk of major co-morbidities can increase with age, therefore
deaths from causes other than breast cancer can be a major
component of overall survival. in this trial no speciﬁc cause

of death was increased signiﬁcantly in patients assigned to
anastrozole. further analyses of atac, which are currently
planned for 2010 when all patients will be more than 10 years
post randomization, are eagerly awaited.
the sequential trials in which patients switched to
anastrozole after 2 to 3 years on tamoxifen also show
superiority of anastrozole over tamoxifen with better
tolerability and safety proﬁle. a recent meta-analysis14 has
included data from three clinical trials (abcsg 8, arno,
and ita) in which postmenopausal women with histologically
conﬁrmed, hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer were
randomized to either 1 mg/day anastrozole (n = 2009) after
2 to 3 years of tamoxifen treatment or continued on 20 or
30 mg/day tamoxifen (n = 1997). median follow-up for the
meta-analysis was 30 months (0–89.5), with a total duration of
follow-up of 5389 person-years for the anastrozole group and
5339 person-years for the tamoxifen group. patients switched
to anastrozole had fewer disease recurrences (92 vs 159) and
deaths (66 vs 90) than did those who remained on tamoxifen,
resulting in signiﬁcant improvements in disease-free survival
(hazard ratio 0.59 [95% ci 0.48–0.74]; p ⬍ 0.0001), event-free
survival (0.55 [0.42–0.71]; p ⬍ 0.0001), distant recurrencefree survival (0⋅61 [0⋅45–0⋅83]; p = 0.002), and overall survival
(0.71 [0.52–0.98]; p = 0.04). the meta-analysis only included
data for the time of switched treatment: its results therefore
may not be relevant to a prospective treatment strategy of
starting with tamoxifen with the intention of changing to
anastrozole.
the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant
therapy with anastrozole for 3 years among women who
had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy were evaluated
in the austrian breast and colorectal cancer study group
(abcsg) trial 6a.15 in abcsg trial 6a, patients who were
disease free at the end of abcsg trial 6 were randomly
assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further
treatment. at a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who
received anastrozole (n = 387) had a statistically signiﬁcant
reduced risk of recurrence (loco-regional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with
women who received no further treatment (n = 469; hazard
ratio = 0.62; 95% ci = 0.40 to 0.96, p = 0.031).

toxicity
trial safety data show that the overall tolerability of ais
is similar to that of tamoxifen, with adverse events being
predictably characteristic of estrogen deprivation; however, some important differences in adverse event proﬁles
between tamoxifen and the ais have been demonstrated.

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2009:5

in addition to anti-estrogenic effects, tamoxifen acts as an
estrogen agonist in some tissues, which can lead to serious
side effects not associated with the ais, which prevent
estrogen biosynthesis. a lower incidence of gynecological
and thromboembolic events is observed in patients taking ais,
and fewer cases of endometrial cancer are seen compared with
tamoxifen. adverse events that are more frequent with adjuvant
ai therapy compared with tamoxifen include arthralgia and
myalgia, bone loss, and effects on the cardiovascular system
and blood lipids. the effects of ais on bone are predictable and
may be managed, where necessary, with bisphosphonates.
overall, treatment-related serious adverse events were
fewer in patients receiving anastrozole in the atac trial
compared with those receiving tamoxifen during the
treatment period and similar after treatment completion. the
safety proﬁles for anastrozole and tamoxifen in the sequential
studies were consistent with those previously reported in
other trials,9,10,16 and no new safety issues were identiﬁed
within the context of switching therapy after 2 to 3 years.

cardiovascular and thromboembolic events
although an increase in cardiovascular risk associated with
estrogen depletion is a potential concern with ais,17 there
was no difference in the number of cardiovascular deaths
between the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups (67 [2%]
vs 66 [2%]) in the 100-month analysis of the atac trial;
moreover, the incidence of myocardial infarction was similar
between the two groups, both during treatment (34 [0.27%]
vs 33 [0.27%]) and off treatment (26 [0.28%] vs 28 [0.30%]).
fewer cerebrovascular accidents were noted in patients
receiving anastrozole during treatment (20 vs 34, odds
ratio [or] 0.59 [0.32–1.05], p = 0.056), but not afterwards
(22 vs 20, or 1.10 [0.57–2.13], p = 0.75). the incidence of
thromboembolic events was also decreased with anastrozole
during treatment.

gynecological and menopausal symptoms
in the atac trial, patients randomized to tamoxifen had signiﬁcantly more gynecologic adverse events than those in the
anastrozole group (34.2% vs 20.5%; p ⬍ 0.0001), which led
to more diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions, including an increase in the number of hysterectomies (5.1% vs
1.3%; p ⬍ 0.0001).18 decreased libido and dyspareunia
were reported more frequently with anastrozole than with
tamoxifen, and most of these events were in patients who
had vaginal dryness. recently cuzick and others19 reported
a retrospective analysis of the atac trial to investigate
the association between treatment-emergent endocrine

symptoms (speciﬁcally vasomotor and joint symptoms) and
the risk of breast cancer recurrence. vasomotor symptoms
(eg, hot ﬂushes, night sweats, and cold sweats) are common
side effects of endocrine treatment in women with breast
cancer: in the atac trial, around 35% of patients receiving
anastrozole and 40% of those receiving tamoxifen reported
hot ﬂushes during treatment. excluding patients who already
had vasomotor symptoms and/or joint symptoms at baseline,
the study by cuzick shows that 21.7% and 25.8% of patients
randomized to anastrozole or tamoxifen, respectively, reported
vasomotor symptoms at the 3-month follow-up visit, and
21.1% and 14.3% reported joint symptoms. the emergence
of either symptom was predictive of signiﬁcantly lower recurrence risk in both tamoxifen-treated and anastrozole-treated
patients, even after adjustment for age, bmi, previous hrt,
nodal status, tumor size, and tumor grade. a signiﬁcantly
larger effect was noted for joint symptoms (adjusted hr 0.60
[0.50–0.72], p ⬍ 0.0001), which was similar in both treatment groups, whereas the effect of vasomotor symptoms was
smaller and most apparent in patients who had taken hrt
before study entry. a similar correlation of side-effects with
response to treatment has been noted in a few other situations,
notably graft-versus-host disease for allogeneic bone-marrow
transplantation and skin rash for antibodies directed at the
egfr or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. an inverse association
between the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms and breast
cancer recurrence was previously reported for tamoxifen,20
and extends this association to the ai anastrozole and also to
the presence of joint symptoms. if conﬁrmed, this relationship
between early treatment-emergent symptoms and beneﬁcial
response to therapy might be useful when reassuring patients
who present with these symptoms, and also suggests the
need for effective strategies to manage patients in order to
ensure compliance.

quality of life
a subgroup of patients in the atac trial were assessed
for quality of life21 using the fact-b questionnaire and
endocrine symptoms (es) subscale assessment of es
at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months during the
2-year assessment period most patients showed a clinically
signiﬁcant improvement from baseline in the aggregate of
their physical well-being, functional well-being and breast
cancer speciﬁc concerns, as measured by the fact-b trial
outcome index. conversely, most patients in each treatment
arm experienced a worsening of endocrine-related symptoms
at the 3 month assessment relative to baseline. thereafter
these symptoms appeared to stabilize or improve slightly.

296

there were some interesting differences in the reporting
of the severity of individual endocrine symptoms among
treatment groups. women taking anastrozole reported fewer
cold sweats, but the same number of hot ﬂushes. although
vaginal discharge was reported less often by women taking
anastrozole than women taking tamoxifen, significant
vaginal dryness was more common on anastrozole, as was
dyspareunia and loss of interest in sex.

other primary cancers
deaths due to second primary non-breast cancers and
deaths due to other causes were numerically more frequent
in patients assigned anastrozole in the 100-month analysis
of the atac trial, although differences with tamoxifen are
statistically not signiﬁcant. endometrial cancers, melanomas
and ovarian cancers were less frequent with anastrozole, but
there were more lung and colorectal cancers: only in the case
of endometrial cancer, however, was the difference with
tamoxifen statistically signiﬁcant.
a link between estrogens and a decreased risk of
developing colorectal cancer has been postulated22. in
addition, estrogen receptors alpha and beta have been shown to
inhibit the development of  xxxg170xxx  (apc)dependent colon cancer in mice.23 by contrast, aromatase
seems to enhance disease progression in lung cancers,24
suggesting that the role of estradiol in tumor progression or
tumor regression could be diverse and dependent on cancer
type. since  xxxg730xxx  beta is widely expressed in many
organs, the effects of hormone manipulation on non-breast
malignant disease occurrence needs to be assessed further.
this highlights the need to continue collecting follow-up data
in the adjuvant ai trials.

fractures
the 68-month analysis of atac trial 25 revealed that
treatment-related adverse events occurred signiﬁcantly less
often with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (1884 [61%]
vs 2117 [68%]; p ⬍ 0.0001), as did treatment-related
serious adverse events (146 [5%] vs 277 [9%]; p ⬍ 0.0001)
and adverse events leading to withdrawal (344 [11%] vs
442 [14%]; p = 0.0002). however, it was also noted that
the fractures occurred more often in patients receiving
anastrozole compared to the patients receiving tamoxifen
(340 [11%] vs 237 [8%]; p ⬍ 0.0001). the yearly rate of
fracture remained constant over the treatment period and
was higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen (22.6 vs
15.6 fractures per 1000 women-years; hr 1.43 [95% ci
1.21–1.68]; p ⬍ 0.0001). excess fractures were recorded at

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2009:5

several sites including the wrist, humerus or arm, and spine
but hip fracture occurrence was low in both groups (37 [1%]
vs 31 [1%]). the concomitant use of bisphosphonates was
recorded at every follow-up visit, and overall use was low
in both groups. in the 100-month atac analysis,8 the
increased yearly rate of fracture noted in the anastrozole
group compared with tamoxifen did not continue into the
post-treatment period, where the rate on anastrozole was
similar to that on tamoxifen. therefore the increase in fracture
rates with anastrozole persisted only in the active treatment
period and did not continue after treatment completion. it is
interesting to note that although the effects of anastrozole and
tamoxifen on breast cancer recurrence extended beyond the
cessation of treatment, the higher fracture rates on anastrozole
ceased after the 5-year treatment completion (figure 2). it
has been noted that hip fractures were little affected by anastrozole in this study and although there is 6% to 7% bone
loss during active treatment, no patients with normal bone
density at baseline developed osteoporosis after 5 years’
treatment.26,27 this suggests that bone damage by aromatase
inhibition may be reversible and manageable with the use of
bisphosphonates, although the mechanisms of action of the

bone damage by ais and subsequent recovery after treatment
completion are still unclear.
bisphosphonate therapy reduces bone destruction
and the incidence of subsequent skeletal complications
in the metastatic disease setting, and recent results have
demonstrated their efﬁcacy in the prevention of ai-associated
bone loss (aibl) in patients with early breast cancer.28–30
in one large trial, premenopausal women who received
tamoxifen or anastrozole, both in combination with  xxxd2229xxx 
(n = 401), were randomized to receive  xxxd3561xxx  or no
additional treatment.19  xxxd3561xxx  (4-mg infusion every
6 months) added to both therapy combinations effectively
preserved bone mineral density (bmd) and concomitant
 xxxd3561xxx  not only prevented bone loss during therapy
but improved bmd at 5 years. data on fracture rates
with these two treatment strategies are not yet reported.
the efﬁcacy of  xxxd3561xxx  for prevention of aibl
in postmenopausal women was evaluated by three large
parallel designed trials20,21 (z-fast, zo-fast, and e-zofast) which randomized patients – who received letrozole
2.5 mg/day for up to 5 years – to  xxxd3561xxx  4 mg every
6 months either at initiation of letrozole treatment (immediate

group) or at the time of bmd decline (t-score ⱖ 2 standard
deviations below normal or an occurrence of fracture;
delayed group).31–33. the enrolment included 602 women in
the z-fast study (united states and canada), 1066 women
in the zo-fast study (approximately 30 countries outside
the united states), and 527 women in the e-zo-fast study
(66 countries in south america, the middle east, korea,
europe, and south africa).34,35. the primary endpoint was
the change from baseline in lumbar spine bmd after 1 year
of treatment.
at 1 year in the z-fast study immediate zoledronic
acid (n = 301) provided signiﬁcant mean increases in lumbar
spine and total hip bmd (p ⬍ 0.0001 for both) compared
with delayed treatment (n = 301).23 among patients in the
delayed group, 8.3% met the requirement for zoledronic
acid treatment at 12 months. at both 24 and 36 months,
lumbar spine and total hip bmd continued to increase in the
immediate  xxxd3561xxx  group, whereas bmd continued
to decrease further in the delayed-treatment group.22 in the
zo-fast, study lumbar spine bmd increased from baseline in the immediate group and decreased from baseline in
the delayed group. at month 12, the differences between the
treatment groups in lumbar spine and total hip bmd were
5.7% (95% ci: 5.2%–6.1%; p = 0.0001) and 3.6% (95% ci:
3.3%–4.0%; p = 0.0001), respectively.38 at month 24, the
differences between the treatment groups in lumbar spine
and total hip bmd increased to 8.2% and 4.7%, respectively
(p ⬍ 0.0001 for both). in both studies, levels of biochemical
markers of bone metabolism increased in the delayed group,
but were reduced with  xxxd3561xxx  therapy. currently,
follow-up is too short for assessing fracture incidence. at
1 year in the e-zo-fast studies the differences between the
treatment groups in lumbar spine and total hip bmd were
5.4% and 3.3%, respectively (p ⬍ 0.0001 for both).
recently, guidance on management of cancer treatmentinduced bone loss has emerged and the american society
of clinical oncology published an update on the role of
bisphosphonates and bone health issues in women with
breast cancer.36 recommendations were given for regular
assessments of bone health to screen for osteoporosis.
treatment for bone loss was recommended in breast cancer
patients found to have osteoporosis based on bmd results
(t score –2.5 or lower). breast cancer patients found to
have osteopenia based on bmd results (t score between –1
and –2.5) should have their therapy individualized according
to other risk factors. other recent guidelines have suggested
a slightly more cautious level for intervention (t score ⱕ 2.0)
and the use of bone-targeted treatment in patients with multiple

risk factors for fracture regardless of bmd and/or bone loss of
more than 4% per year at either the hip or lumbar spine.37

arthralgias
arthralgia is an adverse class effect of ais. morales et al
recently reported a prospective study to investigate the
changes in clinical rheumatologic features and magnetic
resonance imaging (mri) of hands and wrists in ai and
tamoxifen users.38 at 6 months, patients on ai had a decrease
in grip strength (p = 0.0049) and an increase in tenosynovial
changes (p = 0.0010) on mri compared to only minor
changes seen in patients on tamoxifen. ai users reported
worsening of morning stiffness and showed an increase in
intra-articular ﬂuid on mri.
crew and others39 conducted a cross-sectional survey
of consecutive postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant
ai therapy for early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer
at an urban academic breast oncology clinic. among the
200 patients who completed the questionnaire assessing
the presence of joint symptoms that started or worsened
after initiating ais, 94 (47%) reported having ai-related
joint pain and 88 (44%) reported ai-related joint stiffness.
in multiple logistic regression analysis, being overweight
(bmi 25 to 30 kg/m2) and prior tamoxifen therapy were
inversely associated with ai-related joint symptoms.
patients who received taxane chemotherapy were more than
4 times more likely than other patients to have ai-related
joint pain and stiffness (or = 4.08, 95% ci, 1.58–10.57
and or = 4.76; 95% ci, 1.84–12.28, respectively). this
study suggests that ai-related joint symptoms are more
prevalent in the real world setting than what has been
described in clinical trials, where arthralgias are reported
in 20% to 35% of the patients treated with an ai. the
success of ai therapy may depend on patients’ ability to
be compliant with treatment recommendations; therefore,
additional studies of interventions that may alleviate these
symptoms are needed.

conclusions
long-term follow up data from the atac trial conﬁrm the
efﬁcacy of anastrozole as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer,
and provide evidence of a carryover effect after completion
of 5 years of treatment. the safety proﬁle of anastrozole is
also conﬁrmed to be favorable, with a predictable pattern
of estrogen-deprivation symptoms (vasomotor symptoms,
joint symptoms and bone loss) which clinicians need to
recognize and manage according to local guidelines. some of

the side effects, especially joint symptoms, may also predict
a decreased risk of recurrence: this could help in reassuring
women and improving compliance.
