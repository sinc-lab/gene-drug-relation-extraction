in vivo hydrolysis of s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx 
in escherichia coli increases export of
5-methylthioribose
jeffrey a. hughes

abstract: escherichia coli can not synthesize methionine from 5-methylthioribose (mtr) but instead exports this sulfurcontaining, energy-rich molecule into the surrounding medium. transforming e. coli with plasmids that direct expression
of the cloned coliphage t3 s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  (sam) hydrolase (samase) induces the met  xxxd313xxx  by cleaving
the sam co-repressor to form 5′- xxxd2619xxx , which is then cleaved to produce mtr. to test the effect of in
vivo samase activity on mtr production and its fate, cultures were incubated in the presence of [35s]methionine and
[methyl-3h]methionine. cells with samase activity produced significantly enhanced levels (up to 40-fold in some trials)
of extracellular mtr — the only radiolabeled compound released in significant amounts — when compared with
controls. sam synthetase (metk) mutants transformed with samase expression vectors did not show this increase,
verifying the path through sam as the sole route to mtr production. samase expression had little or no effect on
intracellular mtr pools, levels of radiolabeled macromolecules, or the transfer of methyl groups to compounds that
could be precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. thus, mtr appears to be a dead-end metabolite in e. coli, begging questions
about how this has evolved, the mechanism of mtr export for the cell, and whether the release of mtr is important
for some other activity.
key words: 5-methylthioribose, s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx , samase, escherichia coli, export.
résumé : escherichia coli ne peut synthétiser la méthionine à partir du 5-méthylthioribose (mtr) et exporte plutôt
cette molécule contenant du soufre et riche en énergie dans le milieu environnant. la transformation de e. coli avec des
plasmides qui dirigent l’expression du coliphage cloné t3 s-adénosyl-l-méthionine (sam) hydrolase (samase) induit
le régulon met en clivant le co-répresseur sam pour former la 5′-méthylthioadénosine qui est ensuite clivée pour produire
le mtr. afin d’évaluer l’impact de l’activité samase in vivo sur la production de mtr et sur son sort, des cultures
ont été incubées en présence de [35s]méthionine et de [méthyl-3h]méthionine. les cellules avec une activité samase
ont produit des niveaux significativement accrus (jusqu’à 40 fois dans certaines expériences) de mtr extracellulaire —
le seul composé radiomarqué libéré en quantités significatives — lorsque comparées aux témoins. des mutants de la
sam synthétase (metk) transformés avec les vecteurs d’expression de la samase n’ont pas manifesté cette augmentation,
ce qui confirme que la voie passant par la sam est la seule menant à la production de mtr. l’expression de samase
n’a eu que peu ou pas d’effet sur les réserves intracellulaires de mtr, les niveaux de macromolécules radiomarquées
ou le transfert de groupes méthyle à des composés précipitables au tca. ainsi, le mtr semble être un métabolite sans
issue chez e. coli, soulevant les questions de comment ceci a-t-il évolué, sur les mécanismes d’exportation du mtr
hors de la cellule et si la libération de mtr est importante pour une quelque autre activité.

synthesis of polyamines, ethylene, biotin, unusual nucleotides
in trna, and most one-carbon transfers involving dna, rna,
proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and other biomolecules
(reviewed in greene 1996; sekowska et al. 2000). the transfer
of the methyl group produces  xxxd3157xxx 
(sah), which is then recycled. other reactions involving
sam, most notably those producing the polyamines spermidine
and  xxxd3234xxx , produce 5′- xxxd2619xxx  (mta; reviewed
in greene 1996). mta does not accumulate in the cell and
is metabolized in most cells to regenerate methionine and
adenine by either of two salvage pathways. in higher organisms,

mta is most commonly cleaved by  xxxg1471xxx  to
produce mtr-1-phosphate (mtrp) and adenine (ferro et al.
1976; pegg and williams-ashman 1969). most simple organisms
(e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae) produce mtrp through a two-step
process. first, mta nucleosidase cleaves mta to produce
5-methylthioribose (mtr) and adenine (this bifunctional
enzyme also cleaves sah to produce s-ribosylhomocysteine
and adenine). second, mtr kinase transfers the terminal
phosphate from atp to form mtrp (duerre 1962; ferro et
al. 1978). methionine is then synthesized from mtrp in a
multi-step enzymatic process (gianotti et al. 1990). the distinction between these two salvage pathways identifies an
attractive site for antibiotic development (gianotti et al. 1990;
riscoe et al. 1988).
curiously, after cleaving mta to mtr with its mta
nucleosidase, escherichia coli does not then synthesize mtrp
from mtr but instead exports it (schroeder et al. 1973).
this seems odd given the energetic cost to the cell and the
elaborate mechanisms that exist in most cells for recycling
sulfur, an often limiting nutrient and important part of
antioxidation mechanisms. escherichia coli lives in an
anaerobic environment unusually rich in sulfur, and it has
been suggested that mtr export evolved because the ability
to remove excess sulfur was an advantage to cells living
under these conditions (sekowska et al. 2000).
the metabolism of sam in e. coli can be studied by
transforming cells with an expression vector containing the
cloned coliphage t3 sam hydrolase (samase) gene (hughes
et al. 1987; posnick and samson 1999). samase cleaves
sam to produce homoserine and mta, and the mta is then
cleaved by mta nucleoside in e. coli to produce mtr.
among its other roles, sam is the co-repressor of the
expression of most genes in the met  xxxd313xxx  (shoeman et al.
1985). these genes, which include the gene for sam
synthetase, metk, are induced upon the samase-mediated
loss of sam (lamonte and hughes 2006). this should set
up a destructive cycle in which in vivo samase activity
induces synthesis of sam synthetase, more sam is then
produced and immediately cleaved by samase into mta,
and the mta is then cleaved by mta nucleosidase into
adenine and mtr.
this putative enhanced synthesis of mtr should produce
a novel and possibly stressful situation for the cell that could
reveal alternative uses for or fates of mtr. this report
details experiments comparing the metabolism of exogenously
supplied radiolabeled methionine by cells transformed with
a samase expression vector to negative controls. the results
of these experiments demonstrated sam-dependent enhanced
mtr production and its export but revealed no alternative
metabolism of methionine or accumulation of labeled
metabolites in cells with in vivo samase activity, though it
remains tempting to speculate on possible roles for the
export of mtr.
escherichia coli k12 strain bw545 (∆lacu169, rpsl) was
used throughout these experiments. bwmj (bw545,
tn5::metj172) and bwmk (bw545, tn5::metk173), strains
induced for expression of elements of the met  xxxd313xxx  due to
a defective apo-repressor (metj) or co-repressor (sam,
produced by metk or sam synthetase) synthesis, were
produced by p1 transduction (miller 1992) from gw2529
and gw2533 (mulligan et al. 1982), respectively. yt medium

(miller 1992) formulated with bacto™ tryptone and bacto™
yeast extract (becton, dickinson, and company, sparks,
maryland, usa) was used for all cultures. all chemicals not
otherwise indicated were purchased from standard biochemical
supply companies.
cells were transformed with either pbr322 or phbbr2
(a pbr322 derivative encoding resistance to tetracycline and
containing a constitutively expressed coliphage t3 samase
gene in an arrangement otherwise similar to the m13hb1
reported in hughes et al. (1987)). samples (3 ml) of sterile
yt containing 15 µg/ml tetracycline were inoculated with
100 µl of an overnight culture and 3 µl of either [methyl3
h]methionine (1 mci/ml, 70 ci/mmol) or [35s]methionine
(15 mci/ml, 1000 ci/mmol) (amersham biosciences corp.,
piscataway, new jersey, usa). they were then incubated
overnight (approx. 16 h) at 37 °c with shaking. to minimize
variability due to the impact of in vivo samase expression
on cell growth rates, viability, and structure — samase
expression induces significant cell filamentation — cultures
were grown to stationary phase, and bacterial growth was
measured spectrophotometrically at a600 rather than by viable
cell counts.
overnight cultures were divided into two fractions: culture
supernatant (the medium remaining after cells were removed
by centrifugation at 13 200g for 10 min) and cell pellet. the
pellet was further subdivided into cell macromolecules (the
precipitate from resuspended cells lysed by vortexing for
2 min with 10% trichloroacetic acid (tca) and collected by
centrifugation for 10 min at 13 200g), and cell small molecules (the post-tca centrifugation supernatant). supernatant
fractions were neutralized with 1 mol/l koh and subjected
to affi-gel 601 (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, california,
usa) affinity chromatography to separate molecules into
cis-diol-containing or -lacking fractions (hughes et al. 1987).
[35s]methionine or methyl-3h radioactivity present in each
fraction was counted by mixing samples in a beckman
readysafe scintillation cocktail (beckman coulter, inc.,
fullerton, california, usa) and quantifying radioactivity in
a beckman ls5000 liquid scintillation counter. results are
expressed as a percentage of the original label added to each
culture. molecule identity was also assessed by several thin
layer chromatography systems (marchitto and ferro 1985).
the fate of exogenously added [35s]methionine and [methyl3
h]methionine in overnight cultures of bw545(pbr322)
and bw545(phbbr2) is detailed in table 1. after overnight
incubation in yt medium, [35s]methionine and [methyl3
h]methionine radioactivity wound up in the non-cis-diol
supernatant fraction and comigrated with mtr in thin layer
chromatography, indicating it was not affected under the
conditions of the incubation (data not shown). all cultures
imported a significant amount of radioactive methionine from
the methionine-rich yt medium. a larger quantity of the
[methyl-3h]methionine appeared to be imported, perhaps
reflecting the use of the methyl group in transmethylations
in addition to mtr synthesis, but the variability of the data
complicates any speculation on this observation (see below).
while statistically insignificant, cultures of cells with in vivo
samase activity consistently converted up to twice as much
methionine to either tca-insoluble or cis-diol-containing
material, suggesting, at best, a marginally enhanced use of
methionine in these cells. as expected from earlier reports

*represents a significant difference between the averages from pbr322 and phbbr2 transformed cells of four independently cultured samples according
to student’s t test (p < 0.05).

(schroeder et al. 1973), control cells released a significant
amount of mtr but no mta (or, apparently, any other
compound), as identified by a single cis-diol-containing
radioactive compound that comigrated with authentic mtr
during thin layer chromatography with either label (data not
shown). in vivo samase activity induced a significant
increase in mtr export, the predicted result given the
samase-mediated 20-fold induction of sam synthetase in
these cells (lamonte and hughes 2006) and subsequent
hydrolysis of sam to mta and then mtr. finally, because
yt medium is approximately 2.6 mmol/l in methionine (as
calculated from “typical analysis” reports available from
becton, dickinson, and company 2005) and because no
more than 20% of this is converted during the course of any
of these experiments, it is not likely that methionine starvation can explain any difference in methionine use between
cells with in vivo samase activity and controls.
under normal conditions, the sulfur atom of exogenously
added methionine is incorporated primarily into proteins
whereas the methyl group can be either added to proteins or
transferred after the synthesis of sam to a wide variety of
compounds. the data comparing the fate of the two labels
reflect this different use. the 35s label was incorporated into
cells at similar levels regardless of samase activity, an indication that sam hydrolytic activity did not affect the ability
of cells to incorporate methionine into proteins. also, cells
in both cultures incorporated the same amount of the 35s label
into tca-insoluble material, suggesting that the enhanced
uptake and conversion of [35s]methionine in cells with
samase is explained by the dead-end conversion to and
export of mtr and not by some other use of the sulfur moiety.
on the other hand, higher levels of the [methyl3
h]methionine label remained in cells lacking samase
activity, suggesting that samase-induced conversion of
methionine to sam and then to mtr prevented alternate
uses of the methyl group. this is supported by previous
studies showing significant inhibition of sam-mediated
activities, such as dna methylation and polyamine biosynthesis
in cells with in vivo samase activity (hughes et al. 1987).
it should be noted that mtr export from cells with in
vivo samase activity varied anywhere from approximately
4- to 40-fold over the samase negative controls in separate
trials, but similar trends (i.e., marked enhancement of mtr

export with in vivo samase activity) were always noted.
this variability is probably due to the uncharacterized growth
inhibitory effects of in vivo samase expression and its
effect on plasmid stability, a problem minimized but not
abolished by use of freshly transformed cells and tetracycline
in the culture medium. the data presented in table 1 were
generated during a single trial from four sets of parallel
cultures to minimize this variability.
the conversion of exogenously added methionine ultimately
to mtr should depend on its condensation with atp to
form sam, and the enhanced export of mtr presumably
results from the samase-mediated enhanced synthesis of
sam and its subsequent degradation to mta and mtr. to
test this, the fate of exogenously added [35s]methionine was
assayed in bwmj (defective metj apo-repressor protein) and
bwmk (contains a leaky sam synthetase mutant with less
than 5% of wild-type activity under inducing conditions),
both of which constitutively express most genes in the met
 xxxd313xxx  in the same manner as the strains from which these
alleles were obtained, as described by mulligan et al. (1982).
bw545 and bwmj exported similar amounts of [35s]5methylthioribose (10.3% in bw545 vs 7.21% in bwmj),
whereas, bwmk converted only 1.27% of the added
methionine to mtr. it should be noted that bwmk cells
(and those of other strains with metk mutations) grow very
poorly when transformed with phbbr2, and these growth
deficiencies may contribute to the lack of mtr export. these
cultures have many highly filamented and inviable cells, as
might be expected from and similar to the results of sam
depletion studies (newman et al. 1998). that any mtr is
produced is presumably explained by the leaky metk mutation
in bwmk that not only allows cells growth but also a level
of sam synthesis sufficient to permit a variety of sammeditated activities, such as dna methylation in this strain.
taken together, these data suggest a sam-dependent path
to mtr production and support a model in which in vivo
samase activity induces sam synthetase expression, the
subsequent rapid cleavage of many of the sam molecules
by samase to produce mta then mtr, and the final export
of apparently expendable mtr that accumulates in the
culture medium. mtr does not accumulate in cells in which
it is overproduced (over 95% of the radiolabel in all of these
cells was tca precipitable), suggesting the presence of an

efficient export system. it would be helpful to identify and
better characterize the mechanism by which this mtr export
is accomplished. it would also be interesting to determine
the extent to which other bacteria share the inability to
metabolize mtr and the extent to which this might complicate
the development and use of antibiotics that target the
methionine recycling pathway. also, suggestions that mtr
export may have resolved detrimental sulfur accumulation or
may not have been penalized in the sulfur-rich intestinal
environment might be tested by incorporating the methionine
recycling genes from bacteria capable of this activity into
e. coli or by identifying and interfering with the mechanism
for mtr export.
an intriguing alternative to this role for mtr export would
be any possibility that such an activity might form the basis
for a symbiotic relationship with one or more other organisms
in e. coli’s complex microenvironment. a notable candidate
might be quorum sensing, a process of bacterial cell–cell
communication important for coordinating the activities among
cells of the same or different species in complex and often
crowded environments (reviewed in schauder and bassler 2001).
quorum sensing depends on small molecules (autoinducers)
to coordinate bacterial cell responses to the external environment, and these molecules are often derived from metabolites of sam, including s-ribosylhomocysteine and mtr
(schauder et al. 2001). in this system, autoinducers must be
exported and imported depending on growth conditions and
culture density — processes that are just now being worked
out in e. coli and other bacteria (xavier and bassler 2005).
in vivo samase activity should not only enhance the synthesis
of sam and mtr but also reduce levels of sah and its
subsequent metabolites (e.g., s-ribosylhomocysteine) by cleaving
sam prior to the events (e.g., transmethylations) that generate
sah (hughes et al. 1987). because these compounds play
roles in autoinducer synthesis, it may be instructive to assess
the impact of in vivo samase expression on quorum sensing.
