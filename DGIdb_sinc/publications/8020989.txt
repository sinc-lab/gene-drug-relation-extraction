the gene encoding the human  xxxg874xxx 
( xxxg874xxx ) was mapped to chromosome band 17q25 by flu-
orescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromo-
somes. an alu variable poly(a) dna polymorphism
was identified in this gene. studies in the ceph fami-
lies showed significant evidence of linkage between
this dna polymorphism and markers localized to the

distallong arm of chromosome 17. © 1994 academic press, inc.

 

glucagon is a 29-amino-acid polypeptide synthesized
by the a-cells of the pancreatic islets of langerhans (7).
it plays a key role in regulating plasma glucose levels by
controlling the hepatic production of glucose. glucagon
is the primary hormone determining blood glucose levels
in the postabsorptive state. in addition to its effects on
the liver, glucagon also stimulates insulin secretion from
pancreatic 8-cells. the physiological effects of glucagon
are mediated by the  xxxg874xxx , a 480-amino-acid
protein, that is a member of the superfamily of seven
transmembrane-spanning receptors.

the rat  xxxg874xxx  cdna has recently been
cloned (2, 6). we generated a 1.4-kb rat genomic dna
fragment corresponding to nucleotides 201-525 of the
rat  xxxg874xxx  cdna sequence using the polymer-
ase chain reaction (pcr) and the primers r@lucr-a
(5-atgtctgccaaaggcaccct-3’) and rglucr-
b (5'-gtcatcatccatctgacatt-3’) based on the
published cdna sequence. the pcr product was cloned
into pgem-3z and sequenced to confirm its identity.
this pcr product was **p-labeled by oligolabeling and
used to screen human genomic libraries (stratagene, la
jolla, ca; catalog no. 946205 and 951202) by cross-hy-
bridization to isolate the corresponding human gene.
two clones, anglucr-1.3 and chglucr-2.1.1, were
isolated. an exon present in a 3-kb sau3ai fragment
shared by these clones was partially sequenced (gen-
bank accession no. l24751). there was 85% nucleotide

and 91% amino acid identity between the human se-
quence and the region of nucleotides 208-310 of the rat
 xxxg874xxx  cdna, indicating that we had indeed
cloned the human  xxxg874xxx  gene ( xxxg874xxx ).

to localize  xxxg874xxx , we performed fluorescence in situ
hybridization of biotin-labeled ahglucr-1.3 to normal
human metaphase chromosomes (5). hybridization of
the  xxxg874xxx  probe resulted in specific labeling only of
chromosome 17 (fig. 1). specific labeling of 17q24-q25
was observed on four (15 cells), three (5 cells), or two (5
cells) chromatids of the chromosome 17 homologs in 25
cells examined. of 85 signals observed (85 of 100 17q
chromatids from 25 metaphase cells were labeled), 82
(96%) were located at 17q25, and 3 were located at 17q24

chromosome 17 homologs are identified with arrows; specific labeling

obtained using a zeiss axiophot microscope coupled to a ccd camera.
separate images of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(dapi)-stained chromosomes and the hybridization signal were
merged using image analysis software (image 1.47 and genejoin).

note. the aluvpa dna polymorphism in  xxxg874xxx  was amplified us-
ing pcr and the primers  xxxg874xxx -a (5'-tgaggcaggagaatggcg-
tc-3') and  xxxg874xxx -b (5'-acctattgtgcacccataca-3’). the re-
action was carried in a volume of 25 yi containing 0.1 wg of dna, 10
pmol of **p-labeled primer  xxxg874xxx -a, 1 pmol of primer  xxxg874xxx -b, 50
mm kcl, 10 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3, 1.5 mm mgcl,, 200 nm each
 xxxd1148xxx , dctp,  xxxd1837xxx , and dttp, and 1.5 u of tag dna polymerase in
a geneamp 9600 pcr system (perkin-elmer, norwalk, ct) for 27
cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 1 min, annealing at 62°c for 1 min,
and extension at 72°c for 1 min. the pcr products were separated on
a 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiogra-
phy. the genotype of individual 1331-01 in the ceph database is 1,3.
the loci in this table are in the order (centromere to qter) in which
they are listed in ref. 4, except for d17s131 and d178512, which have
not been precisely localized in the genetic linkage map of chromo-
some 17,

(4%). signals were not observed at any other chromo-
somal sites. similar results were obtained in an addi-
tional hybridization experiment using this probe. these
results indicate that  xxxg874xxx  is located on chromosome 17
band q25.

the  xxxg874xxx  clones were screened for simple tandem
repeat sequences of the forms (ca),, (ag),, (aaat),,
{(aag),,, and (aac), by hybridization with correspond-
ing oligonucleotides. two repeats of the forms (ca), and
(aaat), were identified but they were not polymorphic.
characterization of an alu middle repetitive sequence
(1) in a 1.9-kb psti fragment from clone chglucr-2.1.1
(genbank accession no. l24750) showed that the
poly(a) tract in this sequence was polymorphic, and four
alleles with sizes of 140, 139, 138, and 137 bp and fre-
quencies of 0.79, 0.03, 0.16, and 0.02, respectively, were
noted in studying 84 unrelated caucasians; the primer
sequences and pcr conditions are described in the leg-
end to table 1. this alu variable poly(a) (aluvpa) poly-
morphism showed codominant segregation in 13 infor-
mative ceph families (12, 13293, 1331, 1333, 1340,
1345, 1349, 13850, 1362, 1875, 1877, 1408, and 1416).
two-point linkage analyses using the program clod-
score (version 5.1 of the linkage package) (3) be-

tween the aluvpa dna polymorphism in  xxxg874xxx  and
markers in the ceph database (version 6) showed sig-
nificant evidence of linkage with markers localized to
band 17q25 (table 1) (4). because of the small number
of families typed, it was not possible to position  xxxg874xxx 
precisely within the linkage map, but multipoint analy-
sis using the program cilink suggested that it was lo-
cated in the interval between d17s79 and d17s24. how-
ever, the odds in favor of this order were only 89:1 better
than the next best order, which localized  xxxg874xxx  distal to
d17879,

the mapping of the  xxxg874xxx  gene to chro-
mosome band 17q25 and its localization in the genetic
framework linkage map of chromosome 17 will facilitate
genetic studies of its role in the development of diabetes
mellitus and other metabolic disorders.
