abstract: the  xxxd3049xxx  -derived pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (plp) is the cofactor of enzymes catalyzing a large variety of
chemical reactions mainly involved in amino acid metabolism. these enzymes have been divided in five families and fold types
on the basis of evolutionary relationships and protein structural organization. almost 1.5% of all genes in prokaryotes code for
plp-dependent enzymes, whereas the percentage is substantially lower in eukaryotes. although about 4% of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions catalogued by the enzyme commission are plp-dependent, only a few enzymes are targets of approved drugs and
about twenty are recognised as potential targets for drugs or herbicides. plp-dependent enzymes for which there are already
commercially available drugs are  xxxg618xxx  (involved in the parkinson disease),  xxxg8xxx  (epilepsy),
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (tumors and malaria),  xxxg1626xxx  (african sleeping sickness and, potentially,
tumors), alanine racemase (antibacterial agents), and human cytosolic branched-chain aminotransferase (pathological states
associated to the gaba/glutamate equilibrium concentrations). within each family or metabolic pathway, the enzymes for which
drugs have been already approved for clinical use are discussed first, reporting the enzyme structure, the catalytic mechanism,
the mechanism of enzyme inactivation or modulation by substrate-like or transition state-like drugs, and on-going research for
increasing specificity and decreasing side-effects. then, plp-dependent enzymes that have been recently characterized and
proposed as drug targets are reported. finally, the relevance of recent genomic analysis of plp-dependent enzymes for the
selection of drug targets is discussed.

introduction
pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp), one of the active forms of
 xxxd3049xxx  , was first identified in the mid forties as the cofactor
required for the biochemical reaction of transamination [1].
since then, plp-dependent enzymes have been the subject of
extensive research. the interest aroused by these enzymes is due
to their unequalled catalytic versatility and widespread
involvement in cellular processes. nowadays, more than 140
different enzyme activities based on plp are classified by the
enzyme commission, representing 4% of all known catalytic
activities. this is because plp-dependent enzymes are not only
involved in the synthesis, interconversion and degradation of
amino acids, but also play key roles in the replenishment of
one-carbon units, synthesis and degradation of biogenic
amines, synthesis of tetrapyrrolic compounds and metabolism
of amino-sugars. the consequence of their crucial metabolic
relevance is that a number of these enzymes are widely
recognised drug targets [2,3]. the outstanding catalytic
diversity of plp-dependent enzymes arises from modulation
and enhancement of the coenzyme intrinsic chemical properties
by the surrounding polypeptide matrix. the cofactor alone is
indeed able to catalyze multiple reactions, though at much
lower rates than enzymes [4-7]. plp-catalyzed reactions (scheme
1a ), which involve the heterolytic cleavage of sigma bonds at
the substrate c-alpha, may be classified as reactions proceeding
through: i) elimination of co2 from c-alpha (alphadecarboxylation and transaminating decarboxylation); ii)
deprotonation (racemization, transamination, beta-elimination
and
beta-replacement,
gamma-elimination
and
gammareplacement) and iii) elimination of the side chain of amino
acids (alpha-synthesis and aldolic cleavage) [8-12]. despite the
variety of catalyzed transformations, the mechanisms of

reaction share several common features. the cofactor is
invariantly bound through an aldimine linkage to the epsilonamino group of a lys residue located at the enzyme active site,
forming the so-called "internal aldimine", while "external
aldimines" are referred to as those formed with the substrates
(scheme 1b). both types of aldimines react reversibly with
primary amines in a transaldimination reaction, with formation
of a geminal diamine intermediate, allowing either binding of
substrates or release of products (scheme 1b). during catalysis,
plp acts as an electron sink. the net negative charge arising
from the heterolytic cleavage of sigma bonds is delocalised by
the extensive conjugation of the pi-electrons of the pyridine
ring, which extends to the aldimine bond and the phenolate
substituent at the cofactor c3. the stabilised carbanion is
referred to as the "quinonoid intermediate", in which the
substrate and the cofactor generate a coplanar structure (scheme
1b). although most of plp-catalysis requires the formation of a
quinonoid, there are examples of concerted mechanisms that do
not require its presence, such as in alanine racemase [8,13].
besides the gain in delocalisation energy, an important factor in
the activation of sigma bonds by a pi−system is their
stereochemical arrangement. dunathan [14] pointed out that the
gain in delocalisation energy aids the bond breaking process if
the transition state assumes a geometry that approaches that of
the quinonoid intermediate, i.e. the bond to be broken must be
perpendicular to the pi−system. this fundamental concept
explains how reaction specificity is controlled and points on
the role of the polypeptide chain in directing the coenzyme
intrinsic catalytic properties. recently, some plp-dependent
enzymes were reported to contain other cofactors, such as a
heme group in human  xxxg350xxx  [15,16], an
fe-s cluster in mammalian  xxxg8xxx  [17], and
 xxxd3156xxx 
in
lysine
2,3-aminomutase,
biotin
synthase and  xxxg350xxx  [15,16,18,19]. this
adds a further level of complexity and regulation in plpdependent catalysis.
on the basis of the available structural information, it is
generally accepted that plp-dependent enzymes originated very

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

current medicinal chemistry, 2007 vol. 14, no. 12

early in the evolution (before the three biological kingdoms
diverged) from different protein ancestors which generated five
independent families, each corresponding to a different fold
type [20-22]. the families have been named from the more
representative enzyme. the aspartate aminotransferase family
corresponds to fold type i and contains the majority of
structurally
determined
plp-dependent
enzymes.
the
tryptophan synthase beta−subunit family corresponds to the fold
type ii, the alanine racemase family corresponds to the fold type
iii, the d-amino acid aminotransferase family corresponds to the
fold type iv, and glycogen phosphorylase corresponds to fold
type v. nowadays, more than a hundred crystal structures of
plp-dependent enzymes, most of them solved in the last 5
years, are accessible from databases (table 1). furthermore,
thousands of sequences of plp-enzymes have become available
as a follow-up of genomic projects. this wealth of information
represents a frame in which the previously acquired biochemical
data may be reinterpreted and better understood and provides a
platform from which new challenges may be undertaken on the
control of reaction and substrate specificity, the regulation of
the catalytic activity, the relationship between catalytic
a.

1295

properties and evolutionary path, the folding mechanisms and
the development of new and more efficient inhibitors,
eventually suitable as drugs. to this latter goal, it should be
pointed out that structural studies on plp-dependent enzymes
have provided evidence that the regulation of the enzyme
activity is frequently associated with the existence of two
conformational states: an open conformation, endowed with
low, if any, catalytic activity, and a closed conformation,
catalytically active. interaction with the substrate or substrate
analogues, as well as with inhibitors or allosteric effectors,
affects this equilibrium and, thus, modulates the catalytic
activity. the bifunctional enzyme tryptophan synthase
represents a classical example [23-25].
because many plp-dependent enzymes have a well
established involvement in human diseases and a critical role in
metabolic pathways in pathogens and plants, several crystal
structures were also solved in the presence of specific
inhibitors, providing insight into the mechanism of
inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors. representative

[17,26], avg bound to cystalysin [27], carbidopa bound to
 xxxg618xxx  [28], and alpha- xxxd2430xxx 
bound to  xxxg1626xxx  [29]. control of reaction
specificity is particularly important for plp-dependent enzymes
because it is known that they catalyze side reactions at
significant rates with substrate analogues or even with their
natural substrates. this ability has been proposed to play a
physiological role because it often leads to the formation of
inactive forms of the enzyme [30]. whereas the chemistry of
plp-catalyzed reactions makes it easy to design effective
inhibitors, specificity remains a major challenge for their use in
vivo. this is the case for several inhibitors that cannot be used
for pharmaceutical applications because they also inactivate
other plp-dependent enzymes. moreover, all mechanism-based
inhibitors designed for plp-dependent enzymes
bind
irreversibly and the permanent modification of proteins may
generate new antigenic sites which could lead to an autoimmune
response in humans. therefore, it is desirable that new specific
and reversible inhibitors are designed. the availability of the
crystal structure of the target enzymes and computational
methods make this goal achievable.
in recent years, bioinformatic approaches have been
successfully used to discover new plp-dependent enzymes,
characterising those which are functionally unclassified. a
recent intra- and inter-genomic analysis of the distribution of
plp-dependent enzymes has provided evidence that for a
significant fraction of them activity is still uncertain or
unknown [31]. the characterisation of these enzymes may help
to better define some metabolic pathways and discover new
ones, thus widening the scope of perspective therapeutic and
technological strategies.
aminotransferases
- xxxd2177xxx  aminotransferase
 xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) aminotransferase ( xxxg8xxx ;
 xxxg8xxx ) is an ubiquitous enzyme which catalyzes the
conversion of gaba into succinic semialdehyde. the reaction
mechanism is a typical reversible transamination, in which
gaba and alpha-ketoglutarate are the substrates and succinic
semialdehyde and l-glutamate are the products [32].  xxxg8xxx 
is one of the three enzymes which constitute the so called gaba
shunt.  xxxg913xxx  catalyzes the conversion of lglutamate to gaba, consuming a proton and releasing co2. .
the succinic semialdehyde produced in the  xxxg8xxx -catalyzed
transamination is converted into succinate by succinic

amadasi et al.

semialdehyde dehydrogenase and enters the kreb’s cycle.
although the gaba shunt has been found to operate in
prokaryotes [33], mammals [34] and plants [35], it has distinct
physiological functions in these organisms. in bacteria, it plays
a role in carbon and nitrogen metabolism [33]. in eukaryotic
cells,  xxxg8xxx  and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase are
localized in the mitochondria. in plants, gaba is more than just
a metabolite, since its concentration level seems to be related to
oxidative stress, insect wounds and signalling [36]. in
vertebrates, gaba is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in
the central nervous system (cns) [37]. the levels of gaba in
the cns are determined by the relative velocities of the
reactions catalyzed by  xxxg8xxx  and  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase,
the
plp-dependent
enzyme
which
decarboxylates glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter
in the brain. when the concentration of gaba in the brain
decreases below a threshold level, convulsions result [38].
however, if gaba levels are increased, the seizure comes to an
end [39]. it is estimated that about 1% of the world population
is affected by recurring convulsing seizures, caused by several
different diseases, although they are often collectively and
broadly referred to as epilepsy [40]. low gaba levels in the
brain have been indeed implicated in the symptoms associated
with epilepsy [41,42], parkinson’s disease [43], huntington’s
chorea [44], alzheimer’s disease [45] and tardive dyskinesia
[46]. therefore, it is not surprising that anticonvulsant drugs
have been sought for centuries. moreover, since about one
quarter of the epileptic patients do not respond to any marketed
anticonvulsant medicine, the need for new anticonvulsant drugs
is still urgent [40]. gaba concentration in the brain cannot be
increased by direct oral or parental administration of the amino
acid itself, since it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. one
successful strategy consists of using a compound that has
access to the brain and selectively inhibits or inactivates
 xxxg8xxx , thus, increasing the concentration of gaba. a
number of structural analogues and mechanism-based
inhibitors with anticonvulsant activity have been designed and
studied starting from the 1970s (fig. (1a )). the first reported
mechanism-based
inhibitor
was
ethanolamine-o-sulphate
[47,48], followed, some years later, by 4-amino-5-hexynoic acid
(or gamma-ethynyl gaba) [49]. both the compounds never became of
clinical interest. a compound related to gamma-ethynyl gaba,
vigabatrin ( xxxd3508xxx  or  xxxd3508xxx ), turned
out to be the most efficient mechanism-based inhibitor as
anticonvulsant agent [50,51]. moreover, vigabatrin is effective
in treating patients that are resistant to other drugs and is
currently in use in over 60 countries [52].

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

current medicinal chemistry, 2007 vol. 14, no. 12

the determination of the crystal structure of  xxxg8xxx  from
pig is a relatively recent achievement [53], considering the
importance of the enzyme as a target for antiepileptic drug
therapy. the structure of  xxxg8xxx  (fig. (2a )) is very similar to
that of other members of fold type i, in particular ornithine
aminotransferase and dialkylglycine decarboxylase.
three different mechanisms for  xxxg8xxx  inhibition
vigabatrin were proposed on the basis of spectroscopic
radiolabelling evidence [54], chemical intuition [51,55]
radiochemical experiments [56]. all mechanisms start with
-ooc

binding of vigabatrin (scheme 2, structure 1) to the enzyme as
an external aldimine (structure 2). according to a proposed
mechanism,
an
azallylic
isomerisation
(reaction
a),
corresponding to the tautomerisation that the natural substrate
gaba normally undergoes, generates an electrophilic species
(structure 3). a nucleophilic attack of k329 (the active site
lysine residue) at the terminal carbon of the vinyl group gives
an adduct (structure 4) that easily tautomerises to structures 5
and 6. the alternative two mechanisms begin with an allylic
isomerisation through the vinyl double bond (reaction b) which

yields the electrophilic species 7. this may follow two different
paths. a nucleophilic attack by k329 to the penultimate carbon
of the former vinyl bond (reaction c) leads to formation of
adducts 8 and 9. in a different path, the so called enamine
mechanism, k329 attacks the cofactor imine bond (reaction d),
forming a geminal diamine (structure 10 ) that eliminates the
isomerised inhibitor (structure 11 ). the latter attacks the
cofactor c4’ to give the final adduct 12 . lippert et al. [51]
proposed that the inactivation mechanism follows a single
route, from structures 1 to 6. metcalf [55] suggested two
possibilities in which k329 acts as a nucleophile to form either
adduct 4 or 10 . the enamine mechanism was ruled out by de
biase et al. [54] on the basis of labelling and mass spectrometry
experiments, showing that the peptide comprising k329 bound
to the radiolabelled inhibitor did not contain the cofactor. the
same authors demonstrated that  xxxd3048xxx  was
released from the inhibited enzyme, suggesting that the main
final adducts were either 5 or 8. on the other hand, nanavati and
silverman [56] showed that denaturation of the inactivated
enzyme yielded  xxxd3048xxx  and the enamine
adduct (structure 12 ) in a 75:25 ratio. crystallography and
polarised absorption microspectro-photometry were recently
employed to discriminate amongst the many hypothetical
inactivation mechanisms of vigabatrin [17]. the crystal
structure of  xxxg8xxx  (fig. (2b)), solved after treatment with the
inhibitor in solution, followed by crystallization, showed that
k329 in the covalent adduct is bound to the terminal carbon of
the vinyl group, apparently excluding both alternative
mechanisms which begin with an allylic isomerisation through
the vinyl double bond (reaction b). however, the
crystallographic analysis could not discriminate between
adducts 4 to 6, and more than one of these tautomers could be
present in the crystal. the enamine adduct reported by nanavati
and silverman [56] might have been released from the enzyme
crystals over the time needed for the crystallization. indeed, test
refinement of the model showed that occupancy may be set as
low as 75% without getting unreasonable
b-values,
consistently with the 75:25 ratio previously reported. the
spectroscopic analysis on the crystals soaked in a vigabatrin
solution provided results compatible with the mechanism
proceeding through reaction a, but suggested that the
behaviour of the protein in solution and in the crystal is
different. in particular, the reaction of  xxxg8xxx  crystals with
the inhibitor would not proceed further than structure 3.
unfortunately, vigabatrin has quite severe side effects.
patients consuming daily 0.5 g of vigabatrin, as the requirement
for an efficient treatment, have suffered from an irreversible loss
of their peripheral visual field [57]. the molecular mechanism
of this defect is still unclear [58-60]. however, since visual
dysfunctions are also caused by other anticonvulsant drugs,
this side effect may be a relatively common outcome of
anticonvulsant treatment or even a feature of the natural history
of epilepsy itself [61,62]. other mechanism-based inhibitors,
studied in the 1970s, such as  xxxd2169xxx  [63,64], resulted to be
toxic, non-specific or poorly crossing the blood-brain barrier.
consequently, novel  xxxg8xxx  inhibitors are urgently required
as therapeutic agents for epilepsy and other cns pathologies.
various analogues of vigabatrin have been designed and tested
as inhibitors of  xxxg8xxx . some conformationally restricted
versions of these analogues proved to be very potent inhibitors
[65,66]. a good strategy in designing
mechanism-based
inhibitors of gaba is to incorporate a good leaving group in
the beta-position of an amino acid that is a substrate for the
enzyme. 4-amino-5-fluoro-pentanoic acid [67,68] and some of
its rigid analogues turned out to be potent inhibitors (fig. (1b))
[26,69-71]. many of the inhibitors so far described contain a
hydrophilic carboxylic acid group and this is undoubtedly an
inconvenient feature for compounds that are supposed to cross

amadasi et al.

the blood-brain barrier. therefore, a series of potential
vigabatrin-like inhibitors were recently designed in which the
carboxylic group was replaced with more lipophilic
bioisosteres (fig. (1b)) [72]. one of these compounds turned
out to have an inhibitory potency much greater than that of
vigabatrin [69], although its actual anticonvulsant action has
not yet been tested. some taurine analogues represent a new
class of reversible  xxxg8xxx  inhibitors with ki values close to
that of vigabatrin [73]. since  xxxg8xxx  irreversible inhibition
is hypothesized to be at the basis of its adverse effects, this
class of compounds represents a very interesting alternative to
vigabatrin treatment. recently, aryl semicarbazones (fig. (1c))
have been tested as anticonvulsant agents and were shown to
increase gaba levels in rat models and to inhibit  xxxg8xxx  in
in vitro assays [74].
branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase
branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (bcat; e.c.
2.6.1.42) catalyzes the transamination of the essential branchedchain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine; bcaas) with
alpha-ketoglutarate to form the respective branched-chain alphaketoacids and glutamate [75]. bcat enzymes are found in both
bacteria and higher organisms [76]. mammals have a
mitochondrial ( xxxg247xxx ) and a cytosolic ( xxxg246xxx ) form of the
enzyme [77,78], while bacteria have a single bcat enzyme [79].
whereas most plp-dependent aminotransferases have been
placed in the fold type i (aspartate aminotransferase family), the
bcats belong to the fold type iv of the plp-dependent
enzymes and are the only mammalian proteins in this group
[80]. this was revealed by the three dimensional structure of the
human mitochondrial enzyme, that was determined in the
ketoenamine and pyridoxamine forms [80]. leucine, isoleucine
and valine readily cross the blood-brain barrier, with leucine
diffusion rate higher than that of isoleucine and valine [81].
catabolism of the bcaas provides nitrogen for the synthesis of
glutamate and glutamine. in rat brain,  xxxg246xxx  accounts for about
70% of all bcat activity [82]. it has been shown that rat brain
bcaas provide up to 30% of the nitrogen for glutamate
synthesis in vivo [83]. the brain is unique in that it expresses
two separate bcat isoenzymes: the cytosolic form ( xxxg246xxx ),
which is found in the nervous system, ovary and placenta, and
the common peripheral mitochondrial form ( xxxg247xxx ) which is
found in all organs, except liver. the isoenzymes might play
distinct metabolic roles. in cell culture systems,  xxxg246xxx  is
found only in neurons and developing
oligodendrocytes,
whereas  xxxg247xxx  is found in astroglia and microglia [84,85]. in
the neurotransmitter system, a common function for  xxxg246xxx 
might be to modulate the amount of glutamate available either
for release as neurotransmitter or for use as precursor for
synthesis of gaba [86]. due to the impact of bcaas on
neuronal and astrocytic metabolism and trafficking between
neurons and astrocytes, excess of bcaas may have a profound
influence on neurological function [87].
the human bcat isozymes are 58% identical in amino acid
sequence [88].  xxxg246xxx  and  xxxg247xxx  show similar specificities for
amino acid and alpha-ketoacid substrates. both enzymes
transaminate bcaas and their straight chain analogues, lalloisoleucine and glutamate. a striking difference between
human  xxxg246xxx  and  xxxg247xxx  is the sensitivity of the different
isoenzymes to the inhibition by the neuroactive drug
gabapentin (1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid) (fig. (3))
[87]. gabapentin was designed as a gaba analogue and is
widely used for seizure control [89]. presently, this drug is used
extensively to treat neuropathic pain, migraine headache, and
several other non epilectic conditions [90]. gabapentin inhibits
competitively rat and recombinant human  xxxg246xxx  with a ki
similar to the km for leucine, but is not an effective inhibitor of

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

current medicinal chemistry, 2007 vol. 14, no. 12

human  xxxg247xxx  [87,91]. the difference in this specificity of
gabapentin is likely due to the behavior of  xxxg246xxx  interdomain
loops and the relative orientation between the small and large
domain [91]. because  xxxg246xxx  is the predominant isoenzyme
found in the brain and does not seem to be expressed in most
tissues outside the human brain, gabapentin is unlikely to
influence bcaas metabolism in peripheral tissues [92]. the
ability of gabapentin to inhibit  xxxg246xxx  may be related to its
antiseizure and neuroprotective activity [93]. however,
gabapentin mainly influences brain function in other ways: it
binds with high affinity to the alpha2delta subunit of the voltagesensitive calcium channel [94] and can stimulate glutamine
efflux from astrocytes to be used for neuronal glutamate
synthesis [87,95]. therefore,  xxxg246xxx  does not likely represent
the principal biological target of gabapentin. other compounds
have been synthesized and shown to inhibit human  xxxg246xxx  with
low ic50 (0.8 µm). for example, sulfonyl  xxxd2396xxx  compounds
have demonstrated very high potency, selectivity and
favourable
pharmacokinetic
parameters,
leading
to
neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo [96]. indeed, because
 xxxg246xxx  is involved in the synthesis of the excitatory
neurotransmitter glutamate in the cns, the inhibition of this
enzyme has been proposed as a way to treat neurodegenerative
disorders involving disturbances of the glutamatergic system
[93].
bcat also catalyzes, in mycobacterium
tuberculosis,
bacillus subtilis, bacillus anthracis and bacillus cereus,
methionine formation from ketomethiobutyrate [97]. the
regeneration of methionine consumed during polyamine
biosynthesis is an important pathway in many microorganisms.
in order to develop new antimycobacterial drugs, aminooxy
compounds have been examined as potential mycobacterium
tuberculosis enzyme inhibitors [98]. o-benzylhydroxylamine,
o-t-butylhydroxylamine,
 xxxd439xxx ,
and
oallylhydroxylamine (fig. (3)) yield mixed-type inhibition with
ki values in the low micromolar range. the same compounds
were examined as antimycobacterial agents and were found to
completely prevent cell growth [98]. these compounds
represent a starting point for the synthesis of bcat inhibitors
for treatment of tuberculosis, that remains a major world-wide
health threat.
kynurenine aminotransferase
in most organisms, tryptophan is primarily degraded
through the kynurenine oxidative pathway that begins with the
opening of the indole ring and ends with the formation of nad+
(scheme 3). kynurenine catabolic intermediates have received
attention for their role in the physiological tuning of the cns
and in the etiology and progression of several human
neurodegenerative
disorders [99,100]. three of these
intermediates
are
neuroactive:
kynurenic
acid,
3hydroxykynurenine, and quinolinic acid. kynurenic acid, the
major product of tryptophan degradation, was found to be an
h2n

cooh

antagonist of several subtypes of  xxxg981xxx  [101] and
was used as a lead compound for the development of glutamate
antagonists that may be useful in several cns disorders
[102,103]. 3-hydroxykynurenine can generate free radicals and
contribute to, or exacerbate, neuronal damages [104]. its levels
are elevated in cases of hiv infection, especially when
associated with dementia, infantile spasm and hepatic
encephalopathy [104]. quinolinic acid has been increasingly
implicated in mediating toxic effects in huntington’s disease
[104]. therefore, enzymes of the kynurenine pathway are
interesting targets for rational therapeutic intervention. one of
these, kynurenine aminotransferase (kat; ec 2.6.1.7), is a fold
type i plp-dependent enzyme. kat catalyzes the transamination
of both kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine to kynurenic
acid and xanthurenic acid, respectively. peripheral organs
contain several aminotransferases capable of catalyzing these
reactions. however, only two of these enzymes appear to be
present in the brain, arbitrarily termed kat i and kat ii [99].
they differ substantially in their ph optimum and substrate
specificity, with kat i that shows relatively low specificity,
while kat ii prefers l-kynurenine as substrate. to date, no
preferential kat i inhibitors have been identified. however, it
was shown that alpha-aminoadipic acid,  xxxd3068xxx  and d,l-5bromokynurenine are selective kat ii inhibitors in vitro [99].
these compounds may prove useful in situations in which a
down-regulation of brain kynurenic acid is needed.
xanthurenic acid, another product of the kynurenine
pathway (scheme 3), plays an essential role in the
gametogenesis and fertility of plasmodium falciparum, the
etiological agent of malaria [105]. the concentration of this
compound required for optimal plasmodium falciparum sexual
maturation is well above the average concentration in human
plasma [106]. it follows that 3-hydroxykynurenine
aminotransferase activity in infected mosquitoes could be
essential for providing enough xanthurenic acid for sustaining
the parasite’s gametogenesis. in fact, the 3-hydroxykynurenine
aminotransferase coding sequence turned out to be among a
group of genes which are up-regulated upon ingestion of an
infected blood meal in distinct anopheles species [107,108].
the development of selective inhibitors of this plp-enzyme
may be an innovative strategy for malaria transmissionblocking drugs. the crystal structure of the enzyme from
anopheles gambiae, complexed with the competitive inhibitor
4-(2-aminophenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid (fig. (4)), has been
recently reported [109]. the analysis of the enzyme-inhibitor
complex suggested a number of chemical modifications that
could be made on the inhibitor structure to improve its efficacy
(fig. (5)).

serve as the basis for the development of selective inhibitors.
 xxxg941xxx 
 xxxg941xxx , also called alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase ( xxxg102xxx ; ec 2.6.1.44), is a fold type i enzyme
which catalyzes the reversible transamination between alanine
and glyoxylate, forming pyruvate and glycine [111-113].

human  xxxg102xxx  is a liver peroxisomal enzyme that removes
glyoxylate, converting it to glycine [114]. deficiency of  xxxg102xxx 
leads to the conversion of glyoxylate to oxalate and the
associated metabolic disorder hyperoxaluria type i [115].
individuals suffering from this rare genetic disease face a
progressive renal failure due to the accumulation of insoluble
calcium oxalate.  xxxg102xxx  also seems to be involved in the
response elicited by phenelzine on patients treated for anxiety
disorders. phenelzine (fig. (6)) is a monoamine oxidase
inhibitor which is used in clinical practice to treat depression
with associated anxiety, as well as anxiety disorders such as
panic disorders and
social
phobia
[116,117].
the

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

current medicinal chemistry, 2007 vol. 14, no. 12

[125], which is found ubiquitously in bacteria, d-glutamate is
formed by two different routes of biosynthesis. in bacillus spp.
it is formed in the transamination of d-alanine and alpha–
ketoglutarate, catalyzed by d-amino acid aminotransferase
(daa; ec 2.6.1.21) [126-128], an enzyme which is also found in
higher plants [129]. on the other hand, lactobacillus spp.,
pediococcus spp. and escherichia coli possess a glutamate
racemase [130-132]. both daa and glutamate racemase
activities were found in staphylococcus
haemolyticus [133].
daa, just as alanine racemase, is thus an interesting target for
antibacterial agents. the enzyme, which was first described by
thorne et al. in 1955 [128], is specific for d-enantiomers, but
can accept as substrates various acidic, basic and neutral
(aliphatic and aromatic) amino acids, which are transaminated
with pyruvate, alpha-ketobutyrate and alpha-ketoglutarate [76]. the
presence of an omega- xxxd2154xxx , its amide or a hydrophobic
unbranched chain characterises good amino donors, while the
presence of a hydroxyl group, as in  xxxd5xxx , d-threonine and dtyrosine, prevents binding. several typical inhibitors of plpdependent enzymes inactivate daa, although not specifically.
l- xxxd2870xxx  (fig. (6)) and d-cycloserine (fig. (11 )) are
competitive inhibitors of d-alanine [76]. potent, mechanismbased inhibitors are beta–halo-d-amino acids [134] and
 xxxd2169xxx  (fig. (18 )), although the latter inactivates several
other plp-dependent enzymes.

fig. (4). structure of the active site of kynurenine aminotransferase from
anopheles gambiae complexed with 4-(2-aminophenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid
(apob) (pdb code 2ch2) [109].

neurobiological mechanisms underlying the compound efficacy
in treating anxiety are still debated, although increasing
evidence suggests that gabaergic transmission may play a
major role. the effect of phenelzine is an elevation of brain
levels of biogenic amines, including alanine and gaba [118120]. in turn, glutamine levels are decreased [119], and, since
alanine is an inhibitor of  xxxg913xxx  [121], it may be
postulated that its accumulation, conceivably due at least in
part to  xxxg102xxx  inhibition, may induce a secondary reduction in
brain glutamine levels [122]. the increase of gaba brain levels
observed upon acute and chronic phenelzine treatments is
known to be caused by a sustained inhibition of another plpdependent enzyme,  xxxg8xxx  [123]. an
investigation that examined the effect of phenelzine on several
amino acids levels and  xxxg102xxx  activity indicated a moderate but
dose-related inhibition of the enzyme, which is probably
contributing to the observed increase in alanine brain levels
[124]. the analysis of the amino acid concentrations indicated
an increase only for alanine and gaba, ruling out a role of
phenelzine as a general inhibitor
of
plp-dependent
aminotransferases.

n-acetylornithine aminotransferase
n-acetylornithine aminotransferase (acoat;  xxxg1742xxx ) is
a fold type i plp-dependent enzyme catalyzing the conversion
of n-acetylglutamic semialdehyde to n-acetylornithine in the
presence of alpha-ketoglutarate, a step involved in arginine
metabolism (scheme 4). in escherichia coli, acoat also
catalyzes
the
conversion
of
n-succinyl-l-2-amino-6oxopimelate to n-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelate (dap), one of
the steps in lysine biosynthesis (scheme 4). in vitro data
demonstrate that this enzyme exhibits both acoat and nsuccinyl-l,l-diaminopimelate
aminotransferase
(dapat)
activities with very similar catalytic efficiencies and identical
kinetic mechanisms, suggesting that this enzyme can play a role
in both lysine and arginine biosynthesis in vivo [135].
the diaminopimelate/lysine biosynthetic pathway (scheme
4) provides a number of potential targets for inhibition, some of
which have been shown to be essential for mycobacterial growth
[136]. the products of this pathway, dap and lysine, function as
the cross-linking moiety in the peptidoglycan component of
gram-positive, gram-negative, and mycobacterial cell walls. in
addition, lysine is an essential amino acid in mammals,
suggesting that inhibition of this pathway would be

d-amino acid aminotransferase

long carbohydrate chains, cross-linked by peptide bridges
which contain d-amino acids, such as d-alanine and dglutamate. while d-alanine is synthesized by alanine racemase

bactericidal but without effect on lysine metabolism in
mammals. since acoat/dapat functions in two critical amino
acid biosynthesis pathways, it is a strong candidate for
inhibitor design. acoat was shown to be inhibited in a
competitive way by pantocin b (fig. (6)) [137], an antibiotic
produced by the bacterium erwinia herbicola. e. herbicola has
been found to produce an array of antibiotics that suppress the
growth of the closely related bacterium e. amylovora, the
pathogen responsible for the plant disease fire blight, a
devastating disease of pome fruit plants, most notably apple
and pear trees. e. herbicola (syn. pantoea agglomerans)
colonizes the same plant surfaces as e. amylovora, but is not
pathogenic to the plant [138]. the antibiotics produced by e.
herbicola have different patterns of biological activity and,
presumably, chemical structures. pantocin b contains unusual
structural elements, most notably the methylenediamine
moiety, which has been reported in the structure of only one
other antibiotic, and a  xxxd3251xxx  fragment that is also not
common in natural products
[139].
structure-activity

relationship studies carried out on synthetic derivatives of
pantocin b have provided indications on the role of the various
parts of the molecule in conveying antibiotic activity [140].
the  xxxg2296xxx , essential for cellular import but not
for interacting with the intracellular target, acoat, tolerates a
wide variety of substitutions as long as the key stereocenter is
preserved. the methylenediamine and substituted  xxxd3251xxx 
fragments likely interact extensively with the target, and little,
if any, structural variation is tolerated. a full explanation of
these results will have to wait for the determination of the threedimensional structure of acoat.

peripheral tissues, notably liver and kidney. naturally
occurring and recombinant enzymes from either pig kidney
[141] or rat liver [142] have been purified and characterized. the
main catalytic activity of ddc is the decarboxylation of laromatic amino acids into their corresponding amines. the
physiologically recognized substrates of the enzyme are ldopa and l-5-hydroxytryptophan (l-5-htp), but, at least in
vitro, the enzyme exhibits a much broader substrate specificity.
for this reason, the enzyme is more correctly named as laromatic amino acid decarboxylase. the decarboxylation of ldopa and l-5-htp results in the formation of dopamine and
serotonin, respectively, which are two of the major
neurotransmitters of the mammalian nervous system. due to the
oarh2 c

involvement of ddc in the biosynthesis
of
these
neurotransmitters, the enzyme has been implicated in a number
of clinical disorders, including parkinson’s disease and
hypertension.
like other plp-enzymes, ddc catalyzes side reactions with
turnover numbers of the order of minutes. in particular, ddc
exhibits a half-transaminase activity toward d-aromatic amino
acids accompanied by a cyclic condensation between daromatic amino acids and bound plp [143], and an oxidative

associated with oxygen chemistry (scheme 5). although a
quinonoid intermediate of this novel plp-dependent reaction
(in addition to the external aldimine) has been detected [146],
the complete elucidation of the mechanism of oxidative
deamination reaction may be useful in the design of
mechanism-based inhibitors. a similar oxidative deamination
reaction has been demonstrated to be operative in other alphadecarboxylases,
such as escherichia
coli
glutamate
decarboxylase and lactobacillus 30a  xxxg1626xxx 
toward their alpha-methyl substrates [30].
alpha-methyldopa, a compound considered to be a centrally
acting antihypertensive agent, in vitro behaves as a substrate
and as an inhibitor of ddc. ddc catalyzes the cleavage of alphamethyldopa into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetone and ammonia,
via the intermediate alpha-methyldopamine, which does not
accumulate during catalysis [145]. it has also been
demonstrated that the mechanism of alpha-methyldopa-induced
inactivation results from the covalent linkage of 3,4dihydroxyphenylacetone to plp, with c3 of the ketone attached
to the aldehydic carbon of the coenzyme in an aldol type
adduct, thus trapping the plp-lysine aldimine of the active site
(scheme 6). therefore, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetone behaves as
an active site directed affinity label with an inactivation
efficiency, kinact /ki, equal to 364 m-1min -1.
studies demonstrated that a group of ddc inhibitors is
represented by alpha-chloromethyl and alpha-fluoromethyl derivatives
of dopa [147-151], alpha-vinyldopa and alpha-acetylenic dopa [152],
which have been shown to behave as highly potent irreversible
and selective inhibitors of ddc. they act via an enzymeactivated “suicide mechanism”. inactivation occurs because
ddc decarboxylates these compounds, generating a highly
reactive intermediate that alkylates the enzyme. schiff base
analogs (phosphopyridoxyl aromatic amino acids) [153,154]
and substrate analogs (catechol- or indole-related structures)
[155,156] have been shown to bind to the active site of ddc
and/or to inhibit decarboxylase activity. their dissociation or
inhibition constants range from 10-2 to 10-6 m , depending on
the chemical structure of the analog. among the substrate
analogs endowed with a substituted hydrazine function, lalpha-methyl- alpha-hydrazino-3,4-2,3,4-trihydroxyphenylpropionic
acid (carbidopa (mk 485)), or n-(dl-seryl) n’-2,3,4trihydroxybenzyl-hydrazine (benserazide (ro-4-4602)), deserve
attention because they are compounds used clinically, in
combination with l-dopa, to treat parkinson’s disease (fig.
(7)).

parkinson’s disease involves a progressive loss of
dopamine-producing cells in the midbrain, and l-dopa, given
orally or intraduodenally, remains the most effective treatment
for this disorder, reducing symptoms as bradykinesia or
rigidity. however, since l-dopa is rapidly converted to
dopamine in the bloodstream, it is routinely administered with
a ddc inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide), so that greater
amounts of l-dopa can reach the brain. both carbidopa and
benserazide do not cross the brain-blood barrier. in
combination with l-dopa ( xxxd2471xxx ®(l-dopa/carbidopa) and
madopar®(l-dopa/benserazide)), they increase the amount of ldopa at the cns, extending its plasma half-life from 50 to 90
min. this effect allows the reduction of the drug dose and side
effects due to the presence of dopamine, outside of the cns.
pharmacokinetic and metabolic studies of benserazide in
animals and man have shown that this compound is
metabolized before it reaches the arterial blood, forming serine
and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine (ro 4-5127) [157]. this
finding strongly suggested that ro 4-5127 represents the actual
ddc inhibitor. the interaction of ddc with carbidopa,
benserazide and ro 4-5127 was investigated. while benserazide
behaves as a poor inhibitor (ki ~ 0.3 mm) [158], either
carbidopa [159] or ro 4-5127 [160] bind to the enzyme by a
hydrazone linkage with the plp cofactor through its hydrazine
moiety, and have been found to be powerful irreversible
inhibitors. however, because hydrazine derivatives can react
with both free plp and all plp-enzymes, these inhibitors are not
selective for ddc.
the atomic structures of ligand-free ddc and ddccarbidopa complex were solved [28] (fig. (8)), revealing several
features of the enzyme: the overall structure of the protein, the
were mode of anchoring the coenzyme to the enzyme, the mode
of binding of the antiparkinsonian drug, and which amino acid
residues might be involved in the catalytic activity. as in all
enzymes of the fold type i, ddc consists of a large domain,
containing the plp binding site, and a c-terminal small domain.
a peculiar feature of ddc is that an additional n-terminal
domain of one monomer packs on the top of the other monomer,
resulting in an extended dimer interface. the orientation of the
inhibitor at the active site is well defined, with its carboxylate
moiety approximately orthogonal to the plp ring and its 3’ and
4’ catechol hydroxyl groups hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl
groups of the phosphate of the coenzyme and thr82,
respectively. furthermore, a short stretch of amino acids
(residues 328-339) was not detected in the electron density map
both in the ligand-free and in the carbidopa-ddc structures.
these residues belong to a mobile loop that seems to be
important for catalysis. among these residues, tyr332 has been

identified as an essential residue for amine formation [161]. a
binding model for benserazide, proposed on the basis of the
ddc-carbidopa complex, has allowed the identification of an
additional hydrogen bond interaction between the coenzyme
phosphate group and a hydroxyl substituent of the aromatic
ring [28]. these findings represent relevant information for the
design of more efficient and selective inhibitors of ddc.
 xxxg1626xxx 
 xxxg1626xxx  (odc; e.c. 4.1.1.17) is a plpdependent enzyme catalyzing the initial and rate-limiting step
in the biosynthesis of polyamines, the decarboxylation of lornithine (l-orn) to form the diamine putrescine. polyamines
are not only essential for normal cell growth and differentiation
but also play an important role in cell proliferation and tumor
development. eukaryotic odcs are, in general, highly specific
for l-orn with a weak activity on l-lysine and even lower on larginine [162]. the x-ray structures of native enzymes from
lactobacillus 30a [163], mouse [164], trypanosoma brucei
[29], and human [165] have been solved. the prokaryotic
enzyme has the same fold (fold type i) of aspartate
aminotransferase [163]. there are two domains in each
monomer, an n-terminal domain forming a alpha/beta barrel and
containing the plp-binding lysine, and a c-terminal domain
which has predominantly a beta-sheet structure. the active sites are
formed at the dimer interface between the n-terminal domain of
one subunit and the c-terminal domain of the other. an unusual
property of odc is that the association between two subunits is
quite weak, and the dimers are in rapid equilibrium with
inactive monomers, under physiological conditions. the
structure of eukaryotic odc reveals that the enzyme is
structurally homologous to the bacterial and plant arginine
decarboxylases, bacterial diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase
and alanine racemase (fold type iii), but unrelated to the
bacterial odcs.
alpha-difluoromethylornitine ( xxxd1972xxx , fig. (9)), also known as
eflornithine, was designed as an enzyme-activated irreversible
inhibitor of odc [166]. indeed, incubation of the eukaryotic
enzyme with  xxxd1972xxx  leads to the irreversible loss of activity. the
mechanism of action of  xxxd1972xxx  has been investigated [167]. the
major inactivating adduct formed between  xxxd1972xxx  and odc is
generated by a nucleophilic attack of cys360 on the conjugated
imine (scheme 7). cys360 is located at the active site and plays
an essential role in ensuring correct protonation of the
decarboxylated reaction intermediate at calpha. if cys360 is
mutated to ser or  xxxd2428xxx , there is a large reduction in activity [168],
and the mutated enzyme becomes a decarboxylation-dependent
transaminase due to the frequent protonation at c4’ of the
intermediate [169]. the trypanosoma brucei structure has been
solved in complex with the product putrescine and with  xxxd1972xxx 
[29,164,170], identifying important active site residues. both
putrescine and  xxxd1972xxx  form a covalent schiff base complex with
the cofactor. the side chain amino groups of both compounds
bind in a well conserved pocket that bridges the subunits. in

addition,  xxxd1972xxx  undergoes decarboxylation and forms a
covalent bond with cys360, as previously proposed for mouse
odc (fig. (10 )).  xxxd1972xxx  is an approved drug for the treatment of
african sleeping sickness caused by parasitic trypanosoma
brucei. it is also active in the treatment of pneumocystis
pneumonia in aids patients, and may have therapeutic
potential for a number of other illnesses caused by protozoa and
for diseases involving abnormal
cellular
proliferation,
including cancer [171,172]. the trade name of eflornithine as
manufactured for the treatment of sleeping sickness is
 xxxd1972xxx ®. considering that the odc active site is invariant
between the host and parasite, a selective toxicity of  xxxd1972xxx  for
the parasite cannot be due to a differential inhibitor binding to
the enzyme active site [29], but rather to metabolic differences
between the host and parasite. they mainly consist in a more
rapid turnover of the host odc when compared to that of the
parasite [173,174], and in the requirement for the polyamine
spermidine of the cofactor trypanothione in order to maintain
reduced thiol pools in the parasite [175]. the discovery that
 xxxd1972xxx  was curative against trypanosoma brucei gambiense
infections provided the first alternative to highly toxic
melarsoprol for the treatment of late stage disease [176].
however, utilization of  xxxd1972xxx  is hampered by the large dose
requirement and by the poor activity against the trypanosoma
brucei rodiense strain of the parasite [169]. a number of
inhibitors (substrate or product analogues) of odc have been
reported, but they target the highly conserved active site [177179]. to overcome the poor pharmacology of  xxxd1972xxx , a strategy
consisting in the identification of non-substrate-based
inhibitors has been undertaken. by computational methods
jackson et al . [180] have identified as potential inhibitor of
odc,  xxxg418xxx  sulfate ( xxxd2191xxx , fig. (9)).  xxxg418xxx  behaves as a weak
non-competitive inhibitor of odc with respect to l-orn (ki ~ 8
mm). structural analysis of trypanosoma brucei odc bound to
d-orn and to  xxxg418xxx  (odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn) reveals that the  xxxg418xxx 
binding site is at the junction between the beta-sheet and the alpha/betabarrel domain. this is consistent with the non-competitive
kinetics observed for the inhibition of odc by  xxxg418xxx . a
significant order-to-disorder transition of the loop region
(residues 392-401), located at the dimer interface and
containing important residues for enzyme activity, is observed
in the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure when compared with other
odc structures. the disordering of this region has been
interpreted as the structural basis to explain the inhibition of
odc by  xxxg418xxx . this finding could be useful in the design and
development of allosteric inhibitors of odc. in this regard, it is
of interest that the antizyme, a regulatory protein synthesized in
mammalian cells in response to high polyamine levels, binds at
a site distant from the active site, inhibiting odc activity and
targeting the enzyme for degradation [181].

a number of physiological processes. in addition to its function
in immune and inflammation responses [182,183], histamine is
considered to be a modulator of gastric acid secretion in the
stomach [184,185], a neurotransmitter involved in memory,
appetite and circadian rhythms regulation [186-188], and a
modulator of cell growth [189-191]. histamine is also essential
in angiogenesis, cellular differentiation of mast cells, and bone
loss osteoporosis [186-192]. therefore, hdc is a potential
target for therapeutic intervention in many inflammatory
diseases, some neurological and neuroendocrine disorders,
osteoporosis and even several types of neoplasias [193-196].
the mature, catalytically active, hdc is formed by c-terminal
processing of the ≈ 74 kda primary translation product which,
during
tissue-specific
post-translational
modification,
generates multiple truncated isoforms [197-201].
the
intracellular location and the characterization of these isoforms
need to be taken into account for any inhibition strategy. due
largely to the enzyme instability, the crystal structure of hdc
has not yet been determined. this has prevented the
development of efficient hdc inhibitors that can be used
pharmacologically. up to now, the suicide inhibitor alphafluoromethylhistidine has been useful for basic research on
histamine physiology and molecular biology [202-205]. hdc
is only able to bind histidine or imidazole-containing

analogues, such as the inhibitors alpha-fluoromethylhistidine and
histidine methyl ester [206]. nevertheless, it has recently been
reported that the natural polyphenol epigallo-catechin-3-gallate
acts as an inhibitor of hdc [207].

during the last few years, by comparison with the crystal
structure of the homolog enzyme ddc, a three-dimensional
model of a rat hdc dimer has been built [208], and a number of
residues and motifs, important for hdc catalysis and shared by
mammalian ddc, have been identified [208].

analogy, inhibition of an auxiliary gene product, such as
dapdc, could resensitize resistant strains of s. aureus to betalactam antibiotics.

diaminopimelate decarboxylase

alanine racemase

bacteria have evolved strategies for the synthesis of lysine
from aspartate via formation
of
the
intermediate
diaminopimelate, a metabolite that is also involved in
peptidoglycan formation. diaminopimelate
decarboxylase
(dapdc; e.c. 4.1.1.20) catalyzes the final step of lysine
biosynthesis converting meso-diaminopimelate to l-lysine
(scheme 4). unlike bacteria, humans obtain l-lysine from
dietary sources. therefore, dapdc represents a potential target
for broad-spectrum inhibitors, either for use as primary
antibiotics or as adjuncts to existing therapies. dapdc is
structurally very similar to eukaryotic odcs [164,165,169] and,
with the exception of a rotation of the c-terminal domain, to
bacillus stearothermophilus alanine racemase [13]. the
structure of dapdc has been solved from various sources, such
as escherichia
coli, mycobacterium
tuberculosis and
methanococcus
jannaschii, both in its ligand-free form
[209,210], and complexed with the product lysine [209-211] or
with the substrate analog  xxxd269xxx  [211].

alanine racemase (alar; ec 5.1.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion between l- and d-alanine. the enzyme is a
homodimer belonging to the fold type iii of plp-dependent
enzymes [8,13]. alar is universal to bacteria, including
mycobacteria, and, with a few exceptions [213-216], is absent in
eukaryotes. this taxonomical restriction and the absolute
requirement for d-alanine in biosynthesis of prokaryotic cell
walls, make alar an attractive target for inhibitors that might
function as antibiotics [217,218]. actually, d-alanine is one of
the central molecules of the cross-linking step of the assembly
of peptidoglycan, which is the backbone of bacterial cell wall.
the cell wall is an effective barrier that contributes to drug
resistance, therefore the inhibition of its biosynthetic pathway
can also increase the susceptibility of bacteria and mycobacteria
to other therapeutical agents, with a synergistic effect [219]. in
particular, alar has been proposed as a promising target against
tuberculosis [220]. although tuberculosis mainly affects the
third world, it is still a major concern in developed countries,
mainly due to infection involving patients with aids and after
the advent of multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis
[217].

several competitive inhibitors of dapdc, including azalaic
acid (ki=89±15 µm) and the dead-end product lysine (ki>1
mm), were identified and characterized. dicarboxylic acids bind
with low affinity to dapdc, while diamines appear to be much
stronger inhibitors. however, their strong inhibitory effect is
due to plp sequestration which precludes recycling of the
enzyme after inhibitor binding [211]. although  xxxd269xxx  and
diamines bind dapdc with good affinities, none of these highly
polar molecules (with predicted poor membrane permeability)
inactivate dapdc in vivo [211]. thus, it was suggested that alphafluoromethyl analogs of diaminopimelate may represent lead
compounds for the development of dapdc inhibitors because
the fluorine moiety should increase membrane permeability
[212]. as for the mycobacterium dapdc, the comparison of the
structure of the enzyme with the inhibitor and product-bound
odc structures [164,170] of the
parasitic
flagellate
trypanosoma brucei indicates that dapdc is essential for m.
tuberculosis viability and could be a potential antimycobacterial drug target. although there are currently no
known drugs that target dapdc, one of the most widely
employed drugs used to treat african sleeping sickness is
 xxxd1972xxx  (fig. (9)), a suicide inhibitor that targets t. brucei odc
[170]. an energy-minimized model, starting from a
diaminopimelate molecule placed as the bound  xxxd1972xxx  in the t.
brucei x-ray structure, shows that the same conformation is
conceivable for a putative
dapdc-inhibitor
complex.
stereospecificity of the decarboxylation reaction preceding the
attack of the reactive imine intermediate would likely
require that a diaminopimelate analog be stereospecifically
fluorinated at the d-aminocarboxyl group of diaminopimelate
[210].
it is known that inhibition of an essential gene product
often fails to kill a pathogenic bacterium in vivo because the
host milieu supplements the missing reaction product(s).
although this is extremely unlikely for dapdc, given the high
concentrations of l-lysine required to overcome loss of enzyme
activity in vitro, this scenario remains a formal possibility.
even in this context, an inhibitor of dapdc may be of clinical
utility in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic. in the
widely used combination drug augmentin®, the inclusion of
clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamase, thereby allowing the
antimicrobial component  xxxd161xxx  to reach its target. by

other plp-dependent enzyme drug targets

a number of effective inhibitors of alar have been reported
and most are structural analogues of d- xxxd2428xxx  [219,221-229]. the
wide majority of these compounds are mechanism-based
inhibitors that react with plp, inhibiting the activity of many
plp-dependent enzymes and, consequently, showing lack of
specificity and safety. fluoroalanine and analogous betasubstituted alanines are representative examples (fig. (11 ))
[228,229]. d-cycloserine (d-4-aminoisoxazolidin-3-one, dcs)
is the only inhibitor of alar that has been marketed and is
clinically used (fig. (11 )). it is a cyclic structural analogue of dala and is produced by streptomyces garyphalus and
streptomyces lavendulae [230]. the cycloserine inactivation of
alar has only recently been elucidated (scheme 8) [221,231].
dcs acts as a suicide inhibitor of alar. its mechanism is
characterized by an initial transamination step, followed by
tautomerization to form a stable aromatic product (fig. (12 )).
this proposed mechanism has been supported by the structure
of alar from bacillus stearothermophilus, inhibited by l- and
d-cycloserine [221,232]. dcs is mainly employed as a second
line anti-tuberculosis agent, but its clinical use is restricted
because of serious side effects, such as cns toxicity [217].

streptomyces alar active site confer to the microorganism
resistance to its own product dcs [233]. structural studies
established that each monomer of the homodimeric enzyme
consists of two different domains, an alpha/beta-barrel at the nterminus and a c-terminal domain with a novel architecture
composed primarily of beta-strands. the plp cofactor is located
within the core of the alpha/beta-barrel, where it forms an internal
aldimine linkage with a lysine residue [217]. two arginine

residues and one tyrosine have been found to be involved in
hydrogen bonding with both the plp and inhibitors or
substrate analogues
[13,218,221,222,234],
including
the
competitive inhibitor propionate [223]. structures of the
enzyme with the inhibitors alanine phosphonate and dcs
demonstrated that inhibition of alar often occurs via the
formation of a stable covalent bond with plp [221,222].
achieving specificity and less toxicity to humans, via a noncovalent linkage to alar, would be of great interest. several
approaches have been proposed after inspection of alar threedimensional structure [218]. the first straight-forward method
is to design an inhibitor that can bind within the enzyme active
site, which contains several excellent candidates for hydrogen
bonding as well as hydrophobic interactions [218]. this
strategy has already been pursued, also applying computational
methods that better exploited the available structural
information. electrostatic potentials were calculated and
ionization states of active site residues were predicted [234].
tyr265, within the active site, might have an unusually low pka
of 7.9 and, at ph 7.0, an average charge of –0.37. it follows that
37% of the tyr265 residues, in an ensamble of enzyme
molecules, should be in the phenolate form. furthermore, the
authors stated that this phenolate side chain, that is in close
proximity to the alpha-hydrogen atom of the substrate, appears to
be a unique feature of alar, proposing a strong coupling to the
phenolate ion as a useful feature for selective binding. mustata
and briggs developed a receptor-based pharmacophore model
for alar [235]. different protein conformations were obtained
using molecular dynamics simulations in order to take into
account protein flexibility, and a dynamic pharmocophore
model was built. compounds fitting the pharmacophore model
were identified from the available chemicals directory. other
molecular dynamics studies identified a conserved water
molecule, within the binding site, bridging substrate and
inhibitors with protein residues [236]. this water molecule
might be taken into account for the design of specific alar
inhibitors, by either utilizing it as a bridging group or
displacing it with an entropic gain, in keeping with the results
of an analysis of the interaction of water molecules within the
free and ligand-bound enzyme active sites [237,238], using
hint as a code for the evaluation of the binding free energy
[239-241]. however, the size of the alar binding pocket and,
mostly, the wide size of the active site entrance cast some
doubts on the possibility of designing specific alar inhibitors
[218]. recent studies have shown that the regions of the
corridor constituting the entryway to alar active site are
strongly conserved across species [217]. finally, the inhibition
of the enzyme dimerization could be another way to inactivate

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

the enzyme [240]. this approach has not yet been used for alar,
but has been proposed for other enzymatic targets, as hiv-1
protease [241,242]. recently, a cluster analysis of water
molecules and a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation were
carried out to gain insight into the stabilization of the dimer
interface [243]. the data indicated that water molecules located
at the interface between the two monomers may play a structural
role in the stabilization of alar dimer. on the other hand,
whether alar is always dimeric is still a matter of debate [240].
serine hydroxymethyltransferase
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt; ec 2.1.2.1) is
found in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes [244]. in eukaryotic
organisms, the enzyme is expressed as cytosolic and
mitochondrial isoforms. its major physiological role is to
catalyze the reversible transfer of the cbeta of serine to
 xxxd3334xxx  (h4  xxxd2146xxx ) to form glycine and
5,10-methylene-h4  xxxd2146xxx . in the absence of h4  xxxd2146xxx , shmt
also catalyzes at appreciable rates the aldol cleavage of several
l-3-hydroxyamino
acids
and
the
racemization
and
transamination of both l- and d-alanine. the catalytic
mechanism of the mammalian and the escherichia coli enzymes
has been thoroughly investigated [245]. the crystallographic
structure of shmt from five different sources has been solved
in the absence and presence of ligands [246-250]. shmt plays a
central role in one-carbon metabolism since 5,10-methyleneh4  xxxd2146xxx  is the major one-carbon donor in many methylation
reactions, in the biosynthesis of methionine, lipids and formyl
trna [251]. notably, 5,10-methylene-h4  xxxd2146xxx  participates
directly in pyrimidine biosynthesis by donating a methyl
group to 2’- xxxd1838xxx , forming 2’ xxxd3364xxx  monophosphate, and, indirectly, in purine
biosynthesis via its conversion to 10-formyl-h4  xxxd2146xxx . glycine
produced in the shmt-catalyzed reaction also participates in
purine biosynthesis providing two carbons and a nitrogen to
the ring. elevated shmt activity has been shown to be coupled
to the increased demand for dna synthesis in rapidly
proliferating cells, particularly tumor cells, like human
leukaemic cells [252] and a variety of solid tumour tissues
[253]. evidence for a preferential channelling of serine towards
nucleotide biosynthesis has been found in hepatic tumors [253255]. this is obtained by an increased activity of the enzymes
involved in serine biosynthesis, paralleled by the retention of
shmt and the simultaneous deletion of  xxxg2043xxx  and
serine aminotransferase, responsible for serine degradation. it is
therefore not surprising that shmt has been often indicated as
an interesting target for cancer chemotherapy
[256,257].
however, among the three members of the thymidylate cycle,
shmt is the only enzyme not yet thoroughly studied as a target
for cancer chemotherapy. drugs targeting the other two
enzymes,  xxxg2366xxx  and  xxxg631xxx ,
have been successfully used clinically [258,259]. analogues of
dihydrofolate, such as methotrexate, are potent inhibitors of

 xxxg631xxx  and have been used for anticancer
therapy for more than 50 years. 5-fluorouracil and tumodex are
clinically established inhibitors of  xxxg2366xxx .
inhibitors of these enzymes have been also used as antibacterial
and antiprotozoal agents [260-262]. however, the emergence of
drug resistance is a common problem [263], hence the need to
identify additional targets for cancer therapy, such as shmt, is
felt.
the only antifolate compounds with anticancer activity
found to inhibit, apparently irreversibly, shmt were sulphonyl
fluoride triazine derivatives [264] (fig. (13 )). the search for
selective serine analogues as inhibitors has been much less
successful. dcs (fig. (11 )) was found to inactivate selectively
shmt in mouse liver extracts and in the liver of mice receiving
a diet deficient in plp [265]. however, it has long been known
that this compound also inactivates other plp-dependent
enzymes, such as  xxxg941xxx  and aspartate
aminotransferase [76]. 4-chloro- xxxd3361xxx  (fig. (13 )) was
shown to be a mechanism-based inactivator of shmt [266] and
thiosemicarbazide turned out to be a slow but tight binding
inhibitor. however, the dubious selectivity of these compounds
has never been tested.
mimosine (fig. (13 )), a naturally occurring plant amino acid
which is an effective cell-specific inhibitor of dna replication
in mammalian cells and approved as an anti-neoplastic drug,
has been proposed to act through the inactivation of shmt.
mimosine was shown to bind to shmt in crude chinese
hamster ovary cells [267], whereas it does not inactivate the
enzyme in vitro. iron deficiency and iron chelators, which can
chelate zinc, are known to alter folate metabolism in mammals.
it has been shown that mimosine, which is also a strong iron
chelator, attenuates shmt transcription by chelating zinc. this
causes the disruption of zinc finger transcription factors with
the consequent repression of shmt gene
transcription
[268,269].
plp-dependent enzymes involved in the trans-sulfuration
pathways
the sulfur-containing amino acids l-cysteine, lhomocysteine and  xxxd2595xxx  are metabolically linked via
the trans-sulfuration and reverse trans-sulfuration
pathways
(scheme 9). in trans-sulfuration, employing the sequential
action of cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-lyase, lcysteine condenses with activated l-homoserine to form the
intermediate l-cystathionine, which, subsequently, is split
symmetrically
into
l-homocysteine
and
pyruvate.
homocysteine can be methylated to yield  xxxd2595xxx .
different organisms possess distinct trans-sulfuration enzymes:
plants and microbes employ only the forward pathway from
cysteine to methionine, mammals exhibit only the reverse transsulfuration pathway, using  xxxg350xxx  and
 xxxg543xxx , while fungi support trans-sulfuration in
both directions. in addition, some anaerobic microorganisms

are able to further process methionine using methionine gammalyase.
cystathionine -synthase
cystathionine gamma-synthase (cgs; e.c. 2.5.1.48) catalyzes the
first reaction in methionine biosynthesis. methionine is an
essential amino acid that can only be synthesized in
microorganisms and plants. enzymes of the methionine
biosynthesis pathway are therefore attractive targets for the
design of new antibiotics and herbicides. cgs synthesizes
cystathionine through a gamma-replacement reaction involving an
activated form of homoserine (o-acetyl or o-succinyl
homoserine for microbial enzyme [270], homoserine phosphate
o

ester for plant enzyme [271]) and l-cysteine. cgss from
bacterial sources have been studied in more detail than those
from plants because the bacterial recombinant enzyme is more
easily expressed in escherichia coli. the physiological gammareplacement reaction follows a complex mechanism that is pingpong when [ xxxd1788xxx ]<kl-cys and ordered when [ xxxd1788xxx ]>kl-cys
[272,273]. cgs can catalyze as side reactions a gamma-elimination
reaction [274,275] as well as beta-elimination, beta-replacement and
alpha- or gamma-proton exchange reactions [274,275].
cgs is homotetrameric (dimers of dimers) with active sites
that are situated at the subunit interface and are formed by
residues from both subunits [276]. the structures of cgs in its
ligand-free, internal aldimine form have been solved from e.
coli [277] and from nicotiana tabacum [278]. an approach for

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

the development of specific and efficient inhibitors is to
exploit the catalytic mechanism of the target enzyme. in transsulfuration enzymes common compounds tested as inhibitors
are l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (avg, an antimicrobial amino
acid first isolated from streptomyces sp.) and propargylglycine
(2-amino-4-pentynoic acid) (fig. (14 )). both derivatives are
able to bind at the formyl moiety of plp and form a schiff base
that can be processed until being transformed into a ketimine
derivative, which cannot proceed further and thus inactivates
the enzyme. however, these mechanism-based inhibitors do not
exhibit specificity for only one of the trans-sulfuration
enzymes. an irreversible mechanism-based inactivation of cgs
can be achieved with the unnatural amino acid propargylglycine
[279,280]. this compound exerts a phytotoxic effect [281,282]
but acts, like avg [283-285], also on other members of the gammafamily, e.g. human liver  xxxg543xxx  (cgl) [285]. in
the case of cgs this is due to the similarity of the catalytic
mechanism to that of cgl and to the limited knowledge about
the specificity determining factors.
in view of the development of new inhibitors and/or drugs,
n. tabacum cgs was complexed with various substrate analogs
[286] and the resulting structures were examined. in particular,
the compounds used were: dl-e-2-amino-5-phosphono-3pentenoic acid, 3-(phosphonomethyl)-pyridine-2-carboxylic
acid, 5-carboxymethylthio-3-(3’-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol
(fig. (14 )). dl-e-2-amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid is a
phosphono analog of the substrate homoserine phosphate and
binds to the plp moiety forming an external aldimine that
could not be isolated since it presumably undergoes a
tautomerization to a ketimine, as dead-end product [286].
however, it shows a low affinity (ki=27 µm) and, therefore, is
unsuitable as a drug. like dl-e-2-amino-5-phosphono-3pentenoic acid,
3-(phosphonomethyl)pyridine-2-carboxylic
acid interacts with both the phosphate and carboxy-binding
sites of cgs [286], but cannot form an external aldimine and its
ki rises to 0.2 mm [286], making this compound not feasible as
a precursor for high affinity inhibitors. instead, 5carboxymethylthio-3-(3’-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-cgs
complex [286] (fig. (15 )) reveals a unique binding mode that
accounts for the higher affinity (ki = 2 µm) of this compound
and provides guidelines for further drug development. the
inhibitor binds to three points of the active site, disrupting the
stacking of plp ring with an aromatic side chain of tyrosine: the
carboxy- and phosphate recognition sites and the hydrophobic
binding pocket. combining the 5-carboxymethylthio-3-(3’chlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol interaction mode with binding
to the phosphate-recognition pocket seems promising for the
development of high affinity inhibitors specific for plant cgs.

cystathionine -lyase
cystathionine beta-lyase (cbl; e.c. 4.4.1.8) is a key enzyme in
sulfur metabolism and catalyzes the penultimate step in the
microbial and plant methionine biosynthesis. the enzyme from
various bacteria (including escherichia coli [287], salmonella
typhimurium [288], bordetella avium [289]) and plants
(including arabidopsis thaliana [290] and spinacia oleracea
[291]) has been isolated and characterized. cystathionine is
cleaved by cbl to produce l-homocysteine, pyruvate and
ammonia. cbl shows extensive homology with cgs and both
proteins belong to the fold type i of plp-dependent enzymes
[292,293].
the
beta-elimination
reaction
involves
a
transaldimination step between the substrate cystathionine and
the enzyme-bound plp, followed by the alpha-proton abstraction to
yield an alpha-carbanion. subsequent elimination of homocysteine
generates the plp derivative of aminoacrylate, which undergoes
reverse transaldimination to produce the enzyme-bound plp
and iminopropionate. the latter is then hydrolyzed to pyruvate
and ammonia. cbl from various sources displays relatively
broad
substrate
specificity
toward
sulfur-containing
aminoacids. in particular, cbl from b. avium utilizes l-cystine
as a substrate to produce l-thiocysteine [289]. the transfer of
sulfane-sulfur from l-thiocysteine to metabolically important
enzymes within or at the surface of sensitive eukaryotic cells is
responsible for the cytotoxicity of this enzyme [289].
the three-dimensional structure of e. coli and a. thaliana
cbl has been resolved by x-ray crystallography [294,295].
both enzymes are tetramers constructed as dimers of dimers.
each monomer comprises three structurally and functionally
distinct regions: an n-terminal domain, a large plp-binding
domain, containing most of the catalytically important
residues, and a smaller c-terminal domain.
since cbl is involved in microbial and plant methionine
biosynthesis, it represents an attractive target for the
development of novel antimicrobial agents or herbicides. cbl
is inhibited by the active site-directed suicide irreversible
inhibitor
beta,beta,beta,-trifluoroalanine
[296].
the
mechanism
proposed involves the formation of a schiff base between the
inhibitor and the enzyme-bound plp. subsequent elimination
of hf from cbeta produces an alpha,beta-unsaturated imine which is an
activated michael acceptor. this adduct can react with a
nucleophile at the active site leading to covalent binding and
inactivation of the enzyme. the elucidation of the atomic
structure of cbl bound to beta,beta,beta,-trifluoroalanine confirmed the
inactivation mechanism and proved that the plp-binding lysine
is the base reacting with the inhibitor via michael addition
[294,296].
cbl is also inhibited by avg (fig. (14 )) [284]. the
interaction of cbl from e. coli and a. thaliana with avg has
been studied by spectroscopic, kinetic and crystallographic
methods [284,294,296]. inhibition of cbl by avg is
reversible, but obeys a slow-binding two-step mechanism. the
inhibitor binds to the free enzyme to form a weak enzymeinhibitor complex which slowly converts to a tightened
enzyme-inhibitor complex (ki=1.1 µm, [284]). by analogy with
the substrate cystathionine, avg enters the active site and
forms the external aldimine with plp. then, the plp-binding
lysine abstracts the alpha-proton from the inhibitor molecule and
transfers it directly to the c4’ of the cofactor. due to the
inability of cbl to catalyze the transamination of avg, the
resulting plp-ketimine is stable and slowly dissociates. it
should be noted that l-methoxyvinylglycine (fig. (16 )), an
analog of avg missing the terminal aminomethyl part, does not
inactivate cbl but undergoes a deamination reaction [284].
this result highlights the importance of the terminal amino
group of avg for the mechanism of inhibition.

fig. (16). chemical structures of cystathionine beta-lyase inhibitors.

rhizobitoxine (fig. (16 )) is a close analog of avg with an
additional ch2 oh group at the distal part of the molecule that
behaves as an antibacterial and phytotoxic amino acid [297300]. although experimental evidence is limited, the cblrhizobitoxine interaction resembles that of avg with cbl and,
thus, is likely to follow the same reaction mechanism. kinetic
parameters and x-ray data of the rhizobitoxine-cbl complex
have not been determined due to difficulties in the preparation
and/or isolation of the toxin [284]. however, a model of the
rhizobitoxine-cbl adduct was built and strongly suggests an
interaction similar to that of avg [284] with a ki=2.2•10-8 m,
confirming preliminary kinetic studies [297].
very recently, a high-throughput screening of cbl against
50000 small molecules has identified two classes of inhibitors,
mixed steady-state inhibitors and covalently-bound inhibitors.
the three-dimensional structure of one compound belonging to
the latter class has allowed to design a small library of
analogues that exhibit a higher degree of inhibition [439].
cystathionine -lyase
 xxxg543xxx  (cgl; e.c. 4.4.1.1.) catalyzes the
second step in the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway, i.e. the
cleavage of l-cystathionine to l-cysteine, alpha-ketobutyrate and
ammonia. while cgl from yeast and rat liver shows an
appreciable cbl-like activity, human cgl displays a strong
substrate specificity and a clear preference of c-s over s-s bond
breakage [285]. in humans, this enzyme is involved in various
metabolic
disorders
(cystathioninuria,
cystinosis
and
homocystinuria [301]), potentially resulting in mental or
physical impairment.
as revealed by the crystal structure of cgl from yeast [276],
the protein is a tetramer and the overall architecture is very
similar to other related plp-enzymes of cys-met metabolism,
like cbl [294,295]. however, in cgl the substrate docks at the
active site in a different orientation with respect to cbl. in fact,
the sulfur atom is in the gamma-position in the case of cbl and
in the delta-position in the case of cgl.
because different organisms display different transsulfuration enzymes, the enzymatic components in plants and
microorganisms are attractive targets for the development of
antibiotics and herbicides. however, it is important to design

h2 n

inhibitors that can discriminate between the homologous active
sites of cgl, cgs and cbl. any prospective inhibitor should
be tested for its reactivity toward cgl, in order to exclude
adverse effects in humans [302]. on the other hand, recent data
suggest that, in the rat, part of the hypotension associated with
haemorrhagic shock is due to the overproduction of
endogenous h2 s by cgl and cbs. therefore, it has been
proposed that cgl inhibitors, reducing h2 s concentration in
the blood, could provide a novel approach to the treatment of
the haemorrhagic shock [303].
avg (fig. (14 )) is a slow-tight binding inhibitor for cgl
and the mechanism of inhibition is analogous to that proposed
for cbl. it should be noted that the inhibition constant of the
avg-cbl complex is 10-fold lower than that of the avg-cgl
complex (10.5 µm [285]). however, the inhibition constant for
the avg-cgl complex is about two orders of magnitude smaller
than the michaelis constant for the natural substrate lcystathionine [285]. therefore, avg seems to be unsuited as a
lead compound for the development of antibiotics
or
herbicides.
propargylglycine (fig. (14 )) and beta,beta,beta,-trifluoroalanine are
suicide inhibitors of cgl [285]. the postulated mechanism of
action of propargylglycine involves an initial alpha-proton
abstraction by the plp-binding lysine and the subsequent
formation of a ketimine intermediate by reprotonation at c4’
(scheme 10 ). then, the lysine residue abstracts the proton at the
beta-position producing an allene which is in conjugation with the
ketimine. the latter is then capable of michael addition to form
a covalent cgl-propargylglycine complex through its activated
gamma-carbon atom. on the basis of this mechanism, it is not
surprising that inactivation of cgl by propargylglycine is a
very fast process, since it involves an attack to the gamma-carbon. the
mechanism proposed for the inactivation of cgl by beta,beta,beta,trifluoroalanine is similar to that proposed for the inactivation
of cbl by the same molecule and the inhibition constant was
found to be 0.27 mm [287]. this inhibitor has a reactive betacarbon, which in cbl is protonated by the plp-binding lysine.
however, in cgl this residue is in an unfavorable orientation to
react at the beta-carbon. this could explain the slower inactivation
reaction of cgl by beta,beta,beta,-trifluoroalanine (kinact =0.027 min-1 )
with respect to propargylglycine [285].
methionine -lyase
methionine gamma-lyase (e.c. 4.4.1.11) catalyzes the breakdown
of methionine by an alpha,gamma-elimination reaction to yield alphaketobutyrate, ammonia, and methanethiol [304,305]. the
enzyme has been found in many microorganisms, such as
pseudomonas spp. and aeromonas spp. and also in anaerobic
strains. many of these are important pathogens, including
bacteria causing botulism (clostridium botulinum), colitis

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

(clostridium difficile), tooth decay (porphyromonas spp.), and
postoperative intra-abdominal infections (bacteroides spp.)
[306]. there are also widespread anaerobic parasites of humans.
these include entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebiasis,
and trichomonas
vaginalis, which causes the sexually
transmitted disease trichomoniasis. the latter is highly
prevalent in women and appears to be a risk factor for human
immunodeficiency virus infections. methionine gamma-lyase has no
counterpart in mammals and so appears to be a good drug target.
the 3d structure of the enzyme from t. vaginalis has been
solved both in the ligand-free form and in the complex with
propargylglycine (fig. (14 )). the enzyme from pseudomonas
putida exists as homotetramer [307]. the spatial fold of
subunits, with three functionally distinct domains, and their
quarternary arrangement, is similar to those of cbl and cgs
from escherichia coli. no structures of complexes of the
pseudomonas enzyme with inhibitors have been determined.
recently, important hints were obtained on a possible prodrug that is activated by the parasite-specific enzyme and has
anti-trichomonal activity in vivo. the fluorine-substitutioncontaining analogue of methionine, trifluoromethionine, may
be a substrate for methionine gamma-lyase, catalyzing an alpha,gamma−
elimination reaction to yield alpha-ketobutyrate, ammonia, and
trifluoromethanethiol. this last compound is unstable under
physiological conditions and nonenzymatically breaks down to
carbonothionic difluoride, a potent cross-linker of primary
amine groups [308,309]. this compound is highly toxic to the
pathogen in which it is produced, whereas toxicity to a
mammalian host is minimal, as activation of the pro-drug does
not occur in the absence of methionine gamma-lyase. thus, pathogengenerated carbonothionic difluoride is bound by the pathogen
material before it
encounters
any
host
molecules.
trifluoromethionine is efficacious in vitro and in vivo against
microorganisms containing methionine gamma-lyase, representing a
lead compound for a novel class of drugs against a range of
anaerobic pathogens [310,311].

proposed for cbl. upon substrate binding, the michaelis
complex is rapidly converted into the external aldimine,
followed by the abstraction of the calpha proton of the substrate to
yield a quinonoid intermediate. subsequent elimination of h2 s
generates the plp derivative of aminoacrylate. protonation of
the aminoacrylate and reverse transaldimination
form
iminopropionate and regenerate the enzyme-bound plp.
hydrolysis of iminopropionate to pyruvate and ammonia
probably occurs outside the active site [27,316]. recently,
residues involved in the catalysis and intermediates of the
reaction have been identified [317,318]. moreover, stoppedflow and quench-flow analysis of the alpha,beta-elimination catalyzed
by cystalysin have allowed to establish that product release is
the rate-limiting step of the catalytic pathway [318].
additionally, it has been demonstrated that cystalysin has a
high catalytic versatility and is able to catalyze the
racemization and transamination of both enantiomers of alanine
[319,320], the beta-desulfination of l- xxxd519xxx  and
the beta-decarboxylation of  xxxd233xxx  and oxalacetate [321].
the virulence potential of t. denticola is strongly dependent on the catalytic activity of cystalysin. its inhibition can
cause the loss of haemolytic activity and the subsequent
shortage of nutrients, resulting in limited growth and cell death.
thus, cystalysin could be an interesting target for the rational
design of specific inhibitors that can function as novel
antibiotics against periodontitis. at present, only avg (fig.
(14 )) has been found to inactivate cystalysin and the atomic
structure of the protein incubated with avg shows the presence
of a ketimine plp-avg covalent adduct, held in place mainly by
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions [27]. this
cofactor-inhibitor complex is similar to that observed with cbl
after interaction with avg and an analogous inactivation
mechanism has been proposed [284]. however, the analysis of
the ligand binding pocket reveals that cystalysin displays a
higher accessibility to the plp cofactor, which indicates the
possibility to accommodate bulky substrates and inhibitors.

cystalysin

cystathionine -synthase

cystalysin is a plp-dependent enzyme isolated from
treponema denticola which catalyzes the alpha,beta-elimination of lcysteine to produce pyruvate, ammonia and h2 s [312,313].
t. denticola, a major member of the oral spirochetes, is a
putative pathogenic agent in adult periodontitis, acute
necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and juvenile and human
immunodeficiency
virus-related
periodontal
diseases.
cystalysin is endowed with hemolytic and hemoxidative
activities, both probably dependent on the production of h2 s,
which is toxic for most cells. as a consequence of lysis, various
nutrients contained in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes become
available to the bacterium, in particular the iron of the heme
group. in addition, the elevated h2 s concentrations created in
the periodontal pocket generate an ecological niche for t.
denticola. thus, cystalysin can be classified as a novel plpdependent virulence factor [313-315].
the atomic structure of cystalysin, solved at 1.9å′
resolution, reveals that the protein is a homodimer belonging to
the fold type i group [27]. each monomer folds into two
domains: the large domain which carries the plp cofactor, and
the small domain, made up of the two terminal regions of the
polypeptide chain [27]. biochemical studies on the plp
binding mode of cystalysin have shown that the coenzyme is
bound at the active site in two different forms and that the
enzyme possesses a broad substrate specificity being a
cyst(e)ine c-s lyase [316] rather than a cysteine desulfydrase.

 xxxg350xxx  (cbs;  xxxg350xxx ) catalyzes the
condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine
via a beta-replacement reaction. cbs from higher eukaryotes is a
unique plp-dependent enzyme, which contains a domain for
binding a heme and a domain for binding  xxxd3156xxx . the role of
the heme as well as that of  xxxd3156xxx  is to regulate the enzyme
activity, without directly participating in the catalytic action
[322,323]. the human full-length cbs structure has not been
determined. however, two crystallographic structures of the
truncated enzyme, containing the heme domain, have been
reported [323,324]. recently, the  xxxd3156xxx  binding site has been
found to be shaped by two hydrophobic domains, named cbs1
and cbs2, located within the c-terminal region of cbs
[325,326]. cbs is structurally related to the fold type ii of the
plp-dependent enzymes.

on the basis of the active site architecture, a catalytic
mechanism has been proposed for the alpha,beta-elimination of lcysteine catalyzed by cystalysin similar to the mechanism

cbs represents a key enzyme in one of the two major
pathways for the clearance of intracellular homocysteine. more
then 100 mutations have been described in cbs gene, and
metabolic dysfunctions due to cbs mutations represent the
most common cause of hereditary homocystinuria, a disease
which is characterized by skeletal problems, dislocated eye
lenses, vascular problems and mental retardation [327].
moreover, it is well established that homocysteine is an
independent risk factor, as smoking or hyperlipidemia, for
atherosclerotic, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral
vascular diseases, and for deep vein thrombosis and
thromboembolism [328]. it follows that there is a high interest
in gaining insights into cbs catalytic mechanism and its
regulation. this should allow a better understanding of its

1314

physiological role and, if possible, the design of allosteric
effectors, able to enhance the activity of the enzyme, that might
eventually be applied in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases.
on the other hand, very recently, the use of cbs inhibitors has
been proposed as a possible novel therapeutic approach to the
treatment of acute stroke. in fact h2 s, an important mediator of
ischemic damage, seems to be produced from cysteine in the
cerebral cortex through the action of cbs [329].
o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase
o-acetylserine
sulfhydrylase
(oass,
o-acetylserine
(thiol)lyase;  xxxg1735xxx .47), belongs to the fold type ii of the
plp–dependent enzymes. oass catalyzes the last reaction in the
biosynthesis of cysteine in bacteria, archaea and plants, a betareplacement reaction that leads to the formation of cysteine
from o-acetylserine (oas) and sulfide, through a bi bi pingpong kinetic mechanism [330]. two isoenzymes, oass-a and
oass-b, are present in several bacteria and exhibit different
substrate specificities [331]. although humans lack oass,
cysteine is not an essential aminoacid, since it can be
synthesized upon condensation of serine and homocysteine,
catalyzed by cbs, to yield cystathionine, that is deaminated
and cleaved by cgl forming cysteine and alpha-ketobutyrate. in
vivo, oass forms bi-enzyme complexes with atp sulfurylase
and serine acetyltransferase (sat), the preceding enzyme in the
cysteine biosynthetic pathway. the complex with sat is
referred to as cysteine synthase (cs). upon formation of cs,
oass activity is reduced both in bacteria [332,333], and plants
[334]. the stability of the complex is related to sulfur
availability in the cell. oas accumulation favors complex
dissociation, an event that is prevented by the presence of
sulfide [332,334-336].
the structure of the oass homodimer has been solved for
the a isozyme from salmonella typhimurium [337-339],
haemophilus influenzae [340] and from the plant arabidopsis
thaliana, and for the b isozyme from escherichia coli [341]. in
particular, the determination of the structure of s. typhimurium
oass in the absence [337] and presence of substrate analogues
and allosteric effectors [339] indicated that the formation of the
external aldimine of plp with l-cysteine, l-serine and
methionine is associated with a conformational change from an
open (inactive) to a closed (active) structure. binding of
chloride to an allosteric anion-binding site, located at the dimer
interface, stabilizes a conformation that differs both from the
open conformation of the internal aldimine and the closed one
of external aldimine [338]. in such state the formation of the
external schiff base and, thus, the subsequent chemistry are
inhibited. the authors suggested that the chloride ion, or other
anions, such as sulfate [342], may behave as an analog of
sulfide, the physiological inhibitor of oass.
the availability of structural data for wild type oass and
some mutants, from different sources, can be exploited for the
structure-based
design
of
specific
inhibitors,
since
microspectrophotometric studies demonstrated the catalytic
competence of oass in the crystalline state [343]. inhibition of
oass, an enzyme present in bacteria and plants, but not in
vertebrates, features possible applications in the design of
herbicides and antibiotics. in principle, this goal could be
tackled by at least three different approaches: i) specific
inhibition by substrate or transition state analogues, ii) use of
allosteric regulatory molecules, iii) interference with
interprotein interactions upon cs complex formation. the latter
approach has been recently undertaken, triggered by the
observation that the c-terminal decapeptide of sat behaves as a
competitive inhibitor of oass, binding to the alpha-carboxyl
subsite (fig. (17 )) [340] with dissociation constants in the
hundreds of nanomolar range [336,344].

amadasi et al.

several inhibitors of plp-dependent enzymes were tested for
inhibitory activity against cs from the leaves of echinochloa
crus-galli [345,346]. preincubation with dl-allylglycine, dlpropargylglycine,
beta-chloro- xxxd2428xxx ,
3-bromopropionate,
amino-oxyacetate,
hydroxylamine
and
cycloserine,
at
concentrations in the millimolar range, inhibited the cs
activity. this finding was correlated with in vivo phytotoxicity,
suggesting that inhibition of cs might affect the growth of
e. crus-galli. however, the supplementation of hexogenous
cysteine failed to reverse inhibition in test tube bioassays,
suggesting that growth inhibition could not be entirely
attributed to the starvation of cysteine [345]. inhibition studies
on plant oass by beta-substituted alanyl inhibitors were also
carried out [347].

fig. (17). structure of the active site of 0-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a
from haemophilus influenzae complexed with the c-terminal decapeptide
of serine acetyltransferase (pdb code 1y7l) [340].

inhibition of cs as a therapeutic strategy is of particular
interest in the case of trichomonas vaginalis, an anaerobic
protozoan parasite of humans [311]. t. vaginalis lacks
glutathione and relies on cysteine as a major redox buffer. it
also seems to lack sat, the enzyme producing oas, and all four
enzymes of the forward and reverse trans-sulfuration pathway,
suggesting that direct methionine-cysteine interconversions do
not occur [311]. it thus appears that cysteine biosynthesis
involves cs utilizing  xxxd1857xxx , rather than oas, and
sulfide or thiosulfate as substrates.
the somewhat broad substrate specificity of oass allows
technological applications in the production of novel beta–
substituted l-aminoacids to be used as building blocks for the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals [341,348,349],
like the s-phenyl-l-cysteine contained in the hiv-protease
inhibitor viracept [350].
cysteine s-conjugate -lyases
some plp-dependent enzymes, mainly aminotransferases,
are able to catalyze cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase reactions. the
products are pyruvate, ammonia and a
sulfur-containing
fragment [351]. different effects of these kind of side reactions
have been reported. if the sulfur-containing fragment is reactive,
the reaction may determine bioactivation of toxicants, as
reported for halogenated alkenes and cysplatin [351,352]. on
the other hand, targeting of prodrugs has been proposed as a
possible beneficial effect of the cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase
action. for instance a bioactivation mechanism based on the
cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases has been proposed to explain the
anti-cancer properties of allium-derived compounds [353] and
has been hypothesized as a route to target pharmacologically
active selenol compounds to the kidney [354].

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

current medicinal chemistry, 2007 vol. 14, no. 12

plp-dependent enzymes involved in heme and essential
amino acid synthesis

formation of 4,5-diaminovalerate as intermediate, which can
dissociate from the enzyme, leaving the latter in the free plp
form and slowing down the reaction. it is not clear whether this
detrimental dissociation, which is clearly detectable during the
catalyzed reaction in vitro [365], is an essential feature of the
catalytic mechanism and if it actually takes place in vivo.

glutamate-1-semialdehyde-1,2-aminomutase
glutamate-1-semialdehyde-1,2-mutase
(or glutamate 1semialdehyde aminomutase; gsam; e.c. 5.4.3.8) catalyzes the
isomerisation of glutamate-1-semialdehyde (gsa) into 5aminolevulinic acid, the universal precursor of tetrapyrroles,
such as chlorophyll, heme and coenzyme b12 . this enzyme is
only present in plants, algae and most bacteria, which obtain
gsa from the reduction of glutamyl-trna, catalyzed by
glutamyl-trna reductase [355]. in animals, fungi and some
bacteria,  xxxd148xxx  is synthesized directly through
the condensation of glycine and succinyl-coa, a reaction
catalyzed by another plp-dependent enzyme, 5- xxxd148xxx 
acid synthase [356]. for this reason, gsam is an interesting
target for specific antibacterial agents. the essential role of the
enzyme in metabolism has been demonstrated for important
pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus [357], salmonella
typhimurium [358] and pseudomonas aeruginosa [359].

some inhibitors of plp-dependent enzymes, such as
 xxxd2169xxx  (fig. (18 )), gamma-ethynyl gaba and  xxxd3508xxx  have
been experimented on gsam [366,367]. however, these
compounds do not possess the specificity and efficiency
required to act as antibacterial agents. recently, the reaction of a
novel and efficient inhibitor, specifically designed for gsam,
2,3-diaminopropyl sulfate (fig. (18 )), was analysed [368]. the
inhibition, which was characterized for the enzyme from
synechococcus, takes place upon the elimination of the sulfate
group, followed by the nucleophilic attack of an unidentified
residue of the enzyme.
threonine synthase
threonine, as well as tryptophan, is among the essential
aminoacids; thus, vertebrates depend for its supply on food
uptake. threonine synthase (ths; e.c. 4.2.99.2) and tryptophan
synthase (see below) are plp-dependent enzymes only present
in plants, bacteria and fungi, making them potential candidates
for compounds acting as antibiotics or pesticides and
herbicides [369,370]. ths catalyzes a beta,gamma−replacement reaction
of o-phospho-homoserine yielding threonine and inorganic
phosphate.
competitive
inhibition
was
observed
for
homophosphoserine analogues with ki in the micromolar range
[371,372], whereas irreversible inhibition was observed for dl2-amino-3-[(phosphonomethyl)amino)] xxxd3029xxx  and z-2amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid, with rate of inactivation
of the order of 1.5 min-1 and a 1:1 stoichiometry [372]. the
proposed mechanism of inactivation differs for the two
inhibitors. for the case of dl-2-amino-3-[(phosphonomethyl)
amino)] xxxd3029xxx , upon the sequential formation of the
external aldimine and the quinonoid intermediate, the electron
pair of the 3 xxxd2850xxx  substituent may attack the pyridine ring to
give a stable spirocyclic derivative of plp [372] (scheme 11 ). in
the case of z-2-amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid, the
reaction proceeds with formation of an equilibrium between two
quinonoid species, one of which is particularly stable. however,
the lack of radiolabeled inhibitors makes it difficult to rule out
an alternative mechanism involving a covalent enzyme
modification [372]. the 3d structure of the enzyme has been
determined from thermus thermophilus [373], saccharomyces
cerevisiae [374] and arapidopsis
thaliana [375,376].
interestingly, the activity of ths from a. thaliana is
allosterically modulated by s- xxxd3156xxx  via a
conformational change that leads to a reorganization of the
active site and a reorientation of plp [376]. furthermore,

the three-dimensional structure of gsam, which has been
solved from three different sources [360-362], and the catalytic
mechanism strictly resemble those of the aminotransferases
[76]. interestingly, moser et al. [363], upon the resolution of
glutamyl-trna reductase crystal structure, proposed a model
whereby the large void of the v-shaped enzyme may be
occupied by gsam. according to this hypothesis gsa, which is
an unstable compound at neutral ph, might be produced at the
active site of the reductase and directly channelled to gsam,
allowing for the efficient synthesis of  xxxd148xxx . a
recent crystallographic study on gsam suggested the presence
of a gating loop which controls accessibility to the active site
and a cross-talk mechanism between the two subunits that
might be involved in substrate channelling and catalysis [364].

the distinctive feature of gsam with respect to other
aminotransferases is that it catalyzes an intramolecular
exchange of the carbonyl and amino groups, which are both
present on the substrate gsa. the catalytic cycle begins with
gsa and the cofactor as pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate and is
completed without the involvement of a second amino acid

structures of ths from mycobacterium tuberculosis and
escherichia coli have been determined and coordinates
deposited in the protein data bank, without any accompanying
publication. these ths structures open the way to studies
aimed to develop new reversible as well as irreversible
inhibitors, eventually candidates for antibiotic and herbicide
activity.
tryptophan synthase
bacterial tryptophan synthase (ts; e.c. 4.2.1.20) is an alpha 2 beta2
complex that catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of
l-tryptophan [25,377,378]. in yeast and fungi the alpha- and betasubunit constitute a single polypeptide chain. indole-3glycerol phosphate is cleaved in the alpha-active site to generate
glyceradehyde-3-phosphate
and
indole.
the
latter
is
subsequently channelled via a hydrophobic tunnel to the betaactive site, that contains plp bound via a schiff base, where it is
combined with l-serine to form l-tryptophan. this channelling
avoids the escape of indole to solution and represents the first
detected example of intramolecular substrate transfer [379]. the
reaction proceeds through the formation of several
intermediates, characterized by distinct absorption and
emission properties. the alpha- and beta-subunit activities are
reciprocally regulated through the stabilization of a
catalytically inactive "open" state or a catalytically active
"closed" state of both the alpha and beta subunits [380-382].
depending on the catalytic intermediate present in the active
site, regulatory signals are generated that affect the opposite
subunit, thus finely tuning the subunit catalytic activities and
keeping them in phase. the structure of the wild type ts and
several mutants has been determined [379,383-392] and
function has been assessed in the crystalline state by polarized
absorption microspectrophotometry in order to determine the
experimental conditions for the selective accumulation of
distinct catalytic intermediates, eventually suitable for x-ray
crystallographic analysis [384,393-395]. these studies provide
to drug designers the reassuring information on the validity of
the enzyme structure for developing inhibitors. computational
procedures have been used for the design of new inhibitors of
the alpha-subunit [396]. the starting structure was that of the
complex with the alpha-subunit ligand and allosteric effector
indole- xxxd3026xxx 
phosphate.
by
several
structural
modifications, guided by the evaluation of the interaction
energy and volume occupancy, a series of indole-acetyl
aminoacids were proposed as potential ligands (fig. (19 )). the
three-dimensional structure of the alpha 2 beta2 complex in the absence
and presence of some of these indole-acetyl aminoacids
provided convincing evidence of the different roles played by
these alpha-subunit ligands [391] (fig. (20 )). furthermore, a series
of arylthioalkylphosphonate inhibitors (fig. (19 )), that are
transition-state analogues and isosteres of the alpha-subunit ligand
indole  xxxd3026xxx  phosphate, were synthesised and assayed in
vitro and in vivo, exhibiting micromolar ic50 s [397]. the
phosphonate moiety was selected due to its capability of
forming hydrogen bonds and not to be degraded by
phosphatases. some of these inhibitors were complexed with ts
and their structures determined [398]. molecular models of ts

from mycobacterium tuberculosis complexed with the same
inhibitors were built as the first step in developing specific
drugs against tuberculosis [399].
studies on the regulation of trpr, the regulator of
tryptophan metabolism, and trpa and trpb, the genes for ts
subunits in chlamydia trachomatis, have unveiled distinct
functional properties for ts present in c. trachomatis serovars
occurring in ocular and genital
infections
[400,401].
furthermore, ts has been found to be one of the enzymes
involved in aminoacid biosynthesis that shows an increased
expression in phytophthora infestans during biotrophic and
necrotrophic infection phases [402]. interestingly, compounds
that act in plant defence mechanisms are synthesized in a series
of reactions, including the production of indole by a specific
 xxxg216xxx  of ts that is not devoted to produce tryptophan.
overall, these findings indicate that both alpha and beta subunits are
suitable targets for the development of compounds active as
pesticides, herbicides or antibiotics.

 xxxg2204xxx 
the plp-dependent enzyme  xxxg2204xxx  converts lserine to  xxxd5xxx . the enzyme has also been shown to catalyze
beta-elimination reactions, as the conversion of l-serine and lserine-o-sulfate to pyruvate [403]. significant amounts of dserine have been found in the brain. this d-amino acid is
synthesized in astrocytes and acts as an endogenous ligand for
the “glycine site” of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-type
glutamate receptors, that play a central role in excitatory
neurotransmission, neuronal plasticity, memory and learning
[404]. over-activation of nmda receptors may lead to cell death
and contributes to post-ischemic brain damage [404]. indeed,
blockers of the  xxxd5xxx  binding site of the nmda receptor were
found to be neuroprotective in animal models of stroke [405].
diminishing nmda neurotransmission might be beneficial in
other conditions associated with excess excitation, like
neurodegenerative diseases [404,406]. studies proposing that
 xxxd5xxx  and nmda transmission may be relevant in psycotic
states as schizophrenia have also been reported [407]. because
the inhibition of  xxxd5xxx  production is a possible strategy to
diminish nmda neurotransmission, in recent years, there has
been an increasing interest on  xxxg2204xxx  as a potential
drug target. strisovsky et al. analyzed a series of compounds
derived from l-serine and l-serine-o-sulfate,
identifying
several weak competitive inhibitors of the mouse enzyme. the
authors stated that the most important structural feature for
binding to mouse  xxxg2204xxx  is the presence of two

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

adjacent carboxylates with optimal c-c distance of 2.6-3.2 å
[403]. very recently, dixon et al. applied one-bead onecompound combinatorial chemistry, together with a highthroughput screening based on fluorescently labeled enzyme, to
find inhibitors of human  xxxg2204xxx . several peptides
showing moderate inhibitory potency (high micromolar kis)
were identified. interestingly, these inhibitors exhibited no
structural similarities to l-serine, the natural enzyme substrate
[408].
alliinase
garlic is well known to exhibit therapeutic effects [409].
antibacterial, antithrombotic and anticancer activities are
exhibited by sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin,
methylallyl-trisulfide and diallyl-trisulfide. in particular,
allicin is formed by the alliinase-assisted hydrolysis of s-allyll-cysteine sulfoxide. alliinase is a plp-dependent enzyme that
has been exploited for the production of allicin either in vitro,
conjugated to a sepharose column [410], or in situ conjugated
to a targeting monoclonal antibody [411]. this represents an
interesting example of the use of a plp-dependent enzyme for
the production of a therapeutically active molecule.

plp-dependent enzymes involved in biotin biosynthesis
7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase
the biosynthesis of the vitamin biotin, a cofactor in
biological carboxylation reactions, occurs in microorganisms
and plants and involves at least four different enzymes (scheme
12 ) [412,413]. because biotin synthesis is unique to plants and
microorganisms, enzymes of this pathway are potential targets
for the development of antimicrobial drugs and herbicides. one
of these enzymes is 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase
(dapas; ec 2.6.1.62), an aminotransferase that catalyzes the
antepenultimate step in this pathway: the conversion of 7-keto8-aminopelargonic acid to7,8-diaminopelargonic acid [414].
dapas from escherichia coli is a homodimer with a
molecular mass of 94 kda [415] and contains 429 residues per
monomer [416]. it is unique among aminotransferases in that it
uses s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  as amino group donor [415].
dapas is expected to follow the established overall mechanism
of b6 -dependent aminotransferases. upon binding of sadenosyl- xxxd2595xxx , the substrate for the first part of the
catalytic cycle, an external aldimine is formed between the
substrate and the cofactor through a transaldimination process.
the reaction proceeds through deprotonation of the former calpha
carbon of the substrate, leading to a quinonoid intermediate.
this step is followed by protonation of the c4’ carbon.
hydrolysis of the resulting ketimine intermediate gives the
ketoacid of the first substrate s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  and
 xxxd3048xxx  bound to the enzyme by non-covalent
bonds. the second half of the catalytic cycle is in principle the
reversal of the first steps. 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid, the
second substrate, binds and receives the amino group from
 xxxd3048xxx  and the plp-enzyme complex is
regenerated. thus, both substrates have to be accommodated in
the same active site, despite differences in size and chemical
properties. although 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid bears an
amino group, dapas uses 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid only
as an amino group acceptor, not as an amino group donor, i.e. it
is not transaminated by dapas [414]. sequence and structure
analysis suggested that dapas may belong to the fold type i
group, which includes a number of enzymes of known structure:
omega-aminotransferase,  xxxg1621xxx , 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase and gsam [417]. several antimicrobial
compounds that specifically inhibit dapas have been isolated
from streptomyces spp. the best studied of these compounds,
amiclenomycin (fig. (21 )), is particularly active against
mycobacteria [418,419]. this amino acid has been isolated as a
free acid and as a part of di- and tripeptides and all these
compounds show antibiotic activities. there is evidence,
however, that amiclenomycin acts as an enzyme irreversible
inhibitor in the form of the free amino acid and that the di- and
tripeptides are hydrolyzed by bacterial peptidases, which
release amiclenomycin [419]. amiclenomycin exists as cis and
trans isomers (fig. (21 )). on the basis of nmr spectra it was
concluded that the natural product exhibits a cis rather than a
trans geometry [420]. inhibition studies of e. coli dapas by
amiclenomycin indicated that the inhibitor binds to the 7-keto8-aminopelargonic acid/7,8-diaminopelargonic acid binding
site of the enzyme [421]. the crystal structures of the complexes
formed between the e. coli holoenzyme and cis and trans
amiclenomycin have been determined [422]. the structure
analysis revealed that the inhibitor forms a covalent adduct
with the cofactor plp, which mimics the external aldimine. the
proposed mechanism of inactivation suggests the formation of
a covalent adduct, which is tightly bound to the active site, and
is accompanied by aromatization of the cyclohexadiene ring of
amiclenomycin (scheme 13 ) [422,423]. inhibition
studies,
absorption spectra, and the crystallographic analysis have
provided evidence that only the cis isomer is a potent inhibitor
of dapas [422].

it was recently reported that the gene encoding for dapas
(bioa) is implicated in long-term survival of mycobacteria
[424], making this enzyme an attractive target for the
development of new drugs against mycobacterium tuberculosis.
amiclenomycin and a new analogue, 4-(4c-aminocyclohexa-2,5dien-1r-yl) xxxd3026xxx  (fig. (21 )), were shown to be suicide
substrates of m. tuberculosis dapas, with inactivation
parameters of ki = 12 µm and kinact = 0.35 min-1, and ki = 20 µm
and kinact = 0.56 min-1, for amiclenomycin and 4-(4caminocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1r-yl) xxxd3026xxx ,
respectively.
the
inactivation was irreversible, and the partition ratios were 1.0
and 1.1 for amiclenomycin and 4-(4c-aminocyclohexa-2,5-dien1r-yl) xxxd3026xxx , respectively, which make these inactivators
particularly
efficient.
4-(4c-aminocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1ryl) xxxd3026xxx  completely inhibited the growth of an e. coli bioa
mutant strain transformed with a plasmid expressing the m.
tuberculosis bioa gene coding for dapas. reversal of the
antibiotic effect was observed on the addition of biotin or
diaminopelargonic acid [423]. thus, 4-(4c-aminocyclohexa-2,5h

dien-1r-yl) xxxd3026xxx  specifically targets dapas in vivo. the
inactivation of m. tuberculosis dapas seems to follow the
same reaction pathway of that found for the e. coli enzyme. this
mechanism is reminiscent of that proposed by rando [425] and
by silverman and coworkers [232,426,427] for the inactivation
of  xxxg8xxx  by several compounds, and more recently by
others for the inactivation of daa [428], and alar [221] by
dcs. it is quite interesting to note that all these plp-dependent
enzymes are inhibited by a similar mechanism, ultimately
yielding an aromatic ring that does not dissociate from the
active site. interestingly, when mycobacterium dapas was
reacted with  xxxd2169xxx  and the antituberculosis drug
cycloserine, the enzyme was not inhibited even at high
concentration (1.3 mm).

plp-dependent enzymes as a drug target

synthase, kapas; ec 2.3.2.47) is a member of the alpha-oxoamine
synthase family of enzymes, a small group of proteins that
typically catalyze claisen condensations between amino acids
and acyl-coa thioesters, with concomitant decarboxylation.
kapas is a homodimeric plp-dependent enzyme. amino acid
sequence comparison and the 3d structure of the enzyme
suggest that it belongs to the fold type i [429,430]. kapas
catalyzes the formation of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid from
 xxxd2428xxx  and pimeloyl-coa, the first step of biotin
biosynthesis (scheme 12 ). attempts to design substrate and
intermediate analogs as inhibitors have been reported [431].
among these compounds, (±)8-amino-7-oxo-8-phosphonononanoic acid (fig. (22 )), designed as a non-decarboxylating
analog of the reaction intermediate, was found to be a reversible
slow binding inhibitor of the enzyme (ki = 7 µm). structural
studies, that would be of great interest for the understanding of
the inactivation mechanism, have not yet been performed.
indeed, many aminophosphonate derivatives have already been
utilized as inhibitors of plp-dependent enzymes, mainly alar,
but none of them has been marketed clinically [226,227]. to
date the structure of kapas from escherichia coli has been
determined in the apo- and holo-form [429], and as the external
aldimine complex [432]. furthermore, the structure of a
covalent adduct of kapas with the suicide inhibitor
trifluoroalanine (fig. (22 )) has recently been reported [433]. it
is well established that a wide range of plp-dependent enzymes
can be inhibited by beta-halo and beta-polyhalo-analogues of their
substrate amino acids. however, the reported crystallographic
structure gives evidence of a difluorinated adduct, suggesting
an
inactivation
mechanism,
involving
an
earlier
decarboxylation step, that is quite different from the one
experimentally demonstrated [294] for other plp-dependent
enzymes with halogenated analogues [433].

genome suggests that this enzyme may have acquired a different
function in eukaryotes, i.e. it catalyzes a different reaction on a
substrate possibly structurally related to threonine. indeed,
very recently, it has been found [435] that the human enzyme
binds o-phospho-homoserine
and
o-phospho-threonine,
slowly degrading them to alpha-ketoglutarate and alpha-ketobutyrate,
respectively, phosphate and ammonia, and is unable to
synthesize  xxxd3361xxx . these findings indicate that inhibitors
of bacterial ths may also interact with the human homolog,
thus adding a further level of complexity to the development of
specific, non toxic compounds with antibiotic activity. the
potential generality of this situation for enzyme targets,
previously assumed to be confined in bacteria, calls for a more
in-depth exploitation of the genomics information for the
selection of drug targets. moreover, a thorough comparison of
plp-dependent enzyme genes in human genome and
pathological species may lead to the discovery of new and
specific targets.

the availability of the complete genome from several
species,
including
homo
sapiens, has
allowed
the
characterization of the distribution of plp-dependent enzyme
genes [31]. it was found that the plp-dependent enzyme genes
in archea and bacteria are about 1.5% with respect to the all
genes and almost two-fold less in eukaryota. furthermore, only
one-third of the plp-dependent activities present in
escherichia coli are also present in h. sapiens. the search
method that was used identifies the conservation of structural
motives within a defined family [434]. this approach was
facilitated by the limited structural diversity of plp-dependent
enzymes, being grouped in five fold types [21]. at least a dozen
“novel” plp-dependent enzyme genes were identified in the
human genome. the characterization of their functional
properties might open the way to new drug targets or may cast
doubts on the possibility of using as a drug target some plpdependent enzymes supposedly present only in bacteria. a
representative example is a plp-dependent human gene highly
homologous to the bacterial ths. because threonine is an
essential aminoacid, ths should not be present in the human
genome and, therefore, it was proposed as a drug target for
inhibitors with antibiotic activity. its presence in the human
