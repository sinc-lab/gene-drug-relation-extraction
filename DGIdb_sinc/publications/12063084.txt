agonist activity at dopamine d2 receptors, bound with high affinity to recombinant human 5-ht1a receptors (h5-ht1a) in chinese hamster
ovary cell membranes and displayed potent, partial agonism at 5-ht1a receptors in a guanosine-5v-o-(3-[35s]thio)-triphosphate
([35s]gtpgs)-binding assay that was blocked completely by a selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist. an interaction with 5-ht1a
receptors may contribute to the overall efficacy of aripiprazole against symptoms of schizophrenia, including anxiety, depression, cognitive
and negative symptoms, and to its favorable side-effect profile. combined with previous studies demonstrating the potent partial agonism of
aripiprazole at dopamine d2 receptors, this study suggests aripiprazole is the first dopamine – serotonin system stabilizer. d 2002 elsevier

1. introduction
aripiprazole, 7-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}- xxxd1818xxx )-quinolinone, is a novel
antipsychotic with a mechanism of action that differs from
all currently marketed typical and atypical antipsychotics.
biochemically, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at members
of the d2 family of dopamine receptors (inoue et al., 1996;
burris et al., 2000). in vivo, aripiprazole displays dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  antagonist effects in models of dopaminergic
hyperactivity (e.g. blockade of apomorphine-induced stereotypy) and dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist activity in a model
of dopaminergic hypoactivity (blockade of increased dopamine synthesis in reserpine-treated rats) (kikuchi et al.,
1995). limited preclinical evidence indicates that aripiprazole has activity at several serotonin receptors of clinical
relevance to schizophrenia including antagonism at 5-ht2a
(kikuchi et al., unpublished observations). aripiprazole is

an efficacious treatment for the positive and negative
symptoms of schizophrenia; however, it does not induce
significant extrapyramidal symptoms or elevate serum prolactin, and has a low propensity to produce weight gain,
sedation or prolongation of qtc interval on electrocardiogram (carson et al., 2000; kane and ingenito, 2000).
while it has long been established that antipsychotic
drug activity is a direct correlate of dopamine d2 receptorbinding affinity (seeman et al., 1976), recent attention has
focused on the  xxxg1108xxx  as a therapeutic target for
the development of improved antipsychotic drugs (meltzer,
1999; millan, 2000). several clinically effective antipsychotics bind in vitro with moderate to high affinity to cloned
human 5-ht1a receptors (richelson and souder, 2000), and
ziprasidone and clozapine behave as partial agonists at
cloned human 5-ht1a receptors (newman-tancredi et al.,
1998). in the present study, a guanosine-5v-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate ([35s]gtpgs)-binding assay was used to determine the potency and relative intrinsic activity of aripiprazole at the human  xxxg1108xxx  (h5-ht1a) expressed
stably in recombinant chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell
membranes. a competitive radioligand-binding assay was

also performed with hydrogen-3 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3h]8-oh-dpat) to evaluate the binding
affinity of aripiprazole at this recombinant h5-ht1a receptor.

2. materials and methods
[35s]gtpgs (1200 ci/mmol), [3h]8-oh-dpat (124.9
ci/mmol) and cho cell membranes stably expressing the
h5-ht1a receptor (cho-h5-ht1a, receptor expression
(bmax) = 1.0 pmol/mg membrane protein) were purchased
from nen life science products (boston, ma). aripiprazole and ziprasidone were synthesized by otsuka pharmaceutical (tokushima, japan). risperidone and gdp were
purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo) and all other
reference compounds were obtained from rbi (natick,
ma).
estimates of potency (pec50) and relative intrinsic activity (emax, maximal drug effect on basal [35s]gtpgs binding
to cho-h5-ht1a membranes expressed as a percentage of
the effect of 10 am serotonin (5-ht)) were obtained for
aripiprazole, 5-ht, (+)-8-oh-dpat, ( )-8-oh-dpat, ziprasidone, buspirone, risperidone, clozapine and way100635 (n-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]n-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide) by incubating each
drug  xxxd1891xxx  different concentrations for 60 min at 22 jc with
cho-h5-ht1a membranes (10 ag protein), mixed with
buffer (25 mm tris –hcl, 50 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2,
0.1 mm egta, ph = 7.4) containing gdp (1 am) and
[35s]gtpgs (0.1 nm). the same [35s]gtpgs-binding assay
was also used to determine the inhibitory potency (pic50) of
the selective 5-ht1a antagonist way-100635, tested at
0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 nm
concentrations, against a 10 am concentration each of
aripiprazole, 5-ht, ziprasidone and clozapine.
all incubations were performed in triplicate, proceeded
for 60 min at room temperature, and were terminated by
rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filter paper presoaked in 50 mm tris – hcl, ph = 7.4, using a brandel
harvester and 4  3 ml ice-cold washes with the same
buffer. radioactive counts were detected by liquid scintillation counting (clingamma, lkb/wallach).
the h5-ht1a receptor-binding affinity of aripiprazole
was determined against the 5-ht1a-selective radioligand,
[3h]8-oh-dpat. the h5-ht1a membranes (15 –20 ag protein) were incubated for 60 min at 20 jc in a buffer (50 mm
tris – hcl, 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.5 mm edta, 0.1% ascorbic
acid, ph = 7.4) containing 1 nm [3h]8-oh,-dpat and
vehicle or aripiprazole at the same concentrations used in
the [35s]gtpgs assays. the binding assays were terminated
by rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filter paper
presoaked in 50 mm tris –hcl, ph = 7.4, and washed once
in 4 ml of the same buffer. nonspecific binding was defined
in the presence of 10 am (+)-8-oh-dpat. the binding affinity of aripiprazole for h5-ht1a receptors (ki) was calcu-

lated by the equation, ki=(ic50)/(1+([[3h]8-oh-dpat]/kd),
where the kd for [3h]8-oh-dpat at h5-ht1a = 0.69 nm
(nen life science products) using nonlinear regression
analysis.
all estimates of h5-ht1a-binding affinity, potency, relative intrinsic activity and inhibitory potency were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of each binding
isotherm using graphpad prism version 3.00 for windows
(graphpad software, san diego, ca).

(table 1). in comparison, potent, full agonist profiles were
detected for 5-ht and (+)-8-oh-dpat, while ( )-8-ohdpat and ziprasidone behaved as potent, partial agonists.
less potent, partial h5-ht1a agonist profiles were displayed
by buspirone, risperidone and clozapine, whereas way100635 failed to stimulate basal [35s]gtpgs binding on
its own. however, way-100635 blocked the stimulatory
effects of 10 am concentrations of 5-ht, aripiprazole,
ziprasidone and clozapine on [35s]gtpgs binding to
cho-h5-ht1a cell membranes, in a concentration-dependent manner in each case (table 1). in this respect, way100635 was 100-fold more potent as an inhibitor of clozapine than of either aripiprazole or ziprasidone. aripiprazole
bound with high affinity (ki = 1.65 nm, 95% confidence
interval = 1.09 to 2.48 nm; ic50 = 4.03 nm, 95% confidence
interval = 2.68 to 6.08 nm) to the h5-ht1a receptor in a
competition-binding assay using [3h]8-oh-dpat.

4. discussion
the main finding of the present study is that aripiprazole
displayed a potent, partial agonist profile in a h5-ht1a
[35s]gtpgs-binding assay using recombinant cho cell
membranes. these data are consistent with the observation
that aripiprazole binds with high affinity to the h5-ht1a
receptor. the potency and relative intrinsic activity of ziprasidone and all other reference drugs tested in the current h5-

139

ht1a [35s]gtpgs-binding assay are similar to previously
published estimates for these drugs (lejeune et al., 1997;
newman-tancredi et al., 1996, 1998; pauwels et al., 1997).
thus, the present h5-ht1a [35s]gtpgs-binding assay was
able to identify correctly drugs with varying degrees of
intrinsic agonist efficacy and potency. the h5-ht1a selective
nature of the present assay was further demonstrated by the
ability of the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way100635 to inhibit fully 5-ht, aripiprazole, ziprasidone and
clozapine-induced increases in [35s]gtpgs binding. in this
respect, way-100635 was a 50- to 100-fold more potent
inhibitor of clozapine than either 5-ht, aripiprazole or
ziprasidone. a likely explanation for this is that 5-ht,
aripiprazole and ziprasidone were far more potent in stimulating the h5-ht1a receptor in the present system than was
clozapine. thus, higher concentrations of way-100635 were
required to block 10 am concentrations of the more potent
drugs, than the less potent clozapine.
most neuropharmacological evidence is consistent with
aripiprazole being a potent, partial agonist at the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  (inoue et al., 1996; burris et al., 2000). the
present data, as well as the ability of aripiprazole to
stimulate [35s]gtpgs binding in rat hippocampal membranes (s. jordan, unpublished observations) and suppress
5-ht metabolism in vivo (jordan et al., 2001), provide the
first evidence that aripiprazole is also a potent, partial
agonist at 5-ht1a receptors. it is interesting to note that
the h5-ht1a receptor agonist potency of aripiprazole, ziprasidone and clozapine in the present [35s]gtpgs-binding
assay are similar to their respective published binding
affinities for h5-ht1a receptors (schotte et al., 1996;
richelson and souder, 2000).
a variety of preclinical data has suggested that the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor is a therapeutic target for the development of
improved antipsychotic drugs (meltzer, 1999; millan,
2000). a putative association has been postulated between
partial agonist activity at  xxxg1108xxx  receptors and improvements in anxiety, depression, cognitive and negative symptoms, and decreased extrapyramidal symptom liability
(millan, 2000). in animal studies,  xxxg1108xxx  agonists
can diminish catalepsy, a model of extrapyramidal symptoms in humans, induced by dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists (mcmillen et al., 1988; andersen and kilpatrick,
1996; prinssen et al., 1999), whereas elevations in serum
prolactin produced by dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists
can be attenuated by partial  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonists (nash
and meltzer, 1989).
the present study demonstrated that aripiprazole is a
high affinity, potent, partial agonist at the h5-ht1a receptor
expressed in cho cell membranes. in the context of
previous studies demonstrating that aripiprazole is a partial
agonist at dopamine d2 receptors (inoue et al., 1996; burris
et al., 2000) and an antagonist at 5-ht2a receptors (kikuchi
et al., unpublished observations), the results of the present
study suggest that aripiprazole may best be described as a
dopamine – serotonin system stabilizer. the preclinical pro-
