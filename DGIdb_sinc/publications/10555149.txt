summary
 xxxg1806xxx  was identified as a target of apc through the
analysis of global gene expression profiles in human
colorectal cancer (crc) cells.  xxxg1806xxx  expression was
elevated in crcs and repressed by apc in crc
cells. this repression was mediated by b-catenin/tcf4-responsive elements in the  xxxg1806xxx  promotor. the
ability of ppars to bind eicosanoids suggested that
 xxxg1806xxx  might be a target of chemopreventive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). reporters
containing  xxxg1806xxx -responsive elements were repressed
by the nsaid  xxxd3259xxx . furthermore,  xxxd3259xxx  was able
to disrupt the ability of  xxxg1806xxx  to bind its recognition
sequences. these findings suggest that nsaids inhibit
tumorigenesis through inhibition of  xxxg1806xxx , the gene
for which is normally regulated by apc.
introduction
colorectal cancer (crc) is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the united states. recent advances
in the understanding of crc have raised expectations
that this growing knowledge might lead to improved
cancer prevention. in this regard, the identification of
genetic alterations that underlie the initiation of colorectal tumors and of drugs which can prevent colorectal
tumors show particular promise. here, we suggest a
molecular basis for the convergence of these two heretofore separate lines of investigation.
a growing body of evidence has shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can suppress colorectal tumorigenesis in both humans and rodents (reviewed in smalley and dubois, 1997; thun, 1997). in
the general population, epidemiological studies have
documented a decreased risk of crc deaths associated
with use of the nsaid aspirin. in individuals with familial
adenomatous polyposis (fap), an inherited predisposition to multiple colorectal polyps, the nsaid  xxxd3259xxx 
can reduce both the size and number of colorectal tumors. likewise,  xxxd3259xxx  and other nsaids have proven
to be effective in prevention of intestinal tumorigenesis
in mouse models of fap. the molecular basis for these
striking chemopreventive effects has been attributed to
inhibition of cyclooxygenases (cox) and the resulting
decrease in prostaglandin production (reviewed in prescott and white, 1996). consistent with this, expression

of cox-2 is elevated in human colorectal tumors (eberhart et al., 1994; sano et al., 1995), and inactivation of
the cox-2 gene in mice is associated with decreased
intestinal tumorigenesis (oshima et al., 1996).
however, other observations are difficult to reconcile
with cox being the sole target of nsaids in the colon.
for example, nsaid derivatives that lack the ability to
inhibit cox have been shown to inhibit colon tumor
growth in vivo and in vitro (piazza et al., 1995, 1997;
mahmoud et al., 1998; reddy et al., 1999). conversely,
colon cancer cells totally devoid of cox activity are
growth inhibited as effectively as cells producing cox
(hanif et al., 1996; elder et al., 1997). likewise, cox-1
and cox-2 null mouse embryo fibroblast cells remain
sensitive to the antiproliferative and antineoplastic effects of nsaids (zhang et al., 1999). in those colon
cancer cells producing cox, cox-produced prostaglandins cannot rescue cells from nsaid-associated
growth arrest in vivo or in vitro (narisawa et al., 1984;
hanif et al., 1996; chan et al., 1998). the concentration
of nsaids that inhibit growth is 10 to 100 times higher
than that required to inhibit cox activity, suggesting the
existence of additional cellular targets (hanif et al., 1996;
ahnen, 1998; charalambous et al., 1998; simmons et
al., 1999). finally, many studies have demonstrated that
the cox-2 protein is elevated in the neoplastic epithelial
cells of human tumors (eberhart et al., 1994; sano et
al., 1995), while cox-2 expression in mouse intestinal
tumors is confined to nonneoplastic stromal cells (oshima
et al., 1996; shattuck-brandt et al., 1999). thus, the
mouse and human cox-2 proteins are located within
disparate cellular populations of the colon, yet tumorigenesis in both species is prevented by the same
nsaids. this suggests either that it is coincidental that
the same agents can exert chemopreventive effects in
mouse and human, or that other targets of nsaids,
common to the neoplastic cells of both species, might
exist and provide a link to the molecular pathogenesis
described below.
molecular genetic studies have identified a series of
genetic alterations associated with the development of
benign tumors (adenomas) and their progression to malignant disease (carcinomas) (reviewed in kinzler and
vogelstein, 1996). in terms of prevention, the alterations
that occur early in this process are of most interest.
inactivating mutations of the apc tumor suppressor
pathway occur early and are found in most colorectal
adenomas and carcinomas. moreover, inherited mutations of apc cause fap, characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas.
several studies have suggested that apc’s association
with b-catenin (rubinfeld et al., 1993; su et al., 1993)
might be critical to its tumor-suppressive effects. in the
colon, b-catenin binds to the tcf-4 transcription factor,
providing a domain that activates genes containing tcf4-binding sites in their regulatory regions (behrens et
al., 1996; molenaar et al., 1996). wild-type apc can
promote the degradation of b-catenin (munemitsu et al.,
1995) and inhibit b-catenin/tcf-4 regulated transcription

(crt), while disease-associated apc mutants are deficient in this ability (korinek et al., 1997; morin et al.,
1997). in tumors lacking apc mutations, oncogenic mutations of b-catenin can lead to increased crt (morin
et al., 1997; rubinfeld et al., 1997).
the targets of this increased crt are therefore likely
to provide insights into apc’s suppressive effects. we
have recently used sage technology to analyze changes
in gene expression following inhibition of crt by apc
in human crc cells and identified the  xxxg1487xxx 
as a direct target of crt (he et al., 1998a). however,
like many other critical regulators of cell growth, apc
is likely to exert its effects through several effectors.
here, we report the identification of another target of
the apc pathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor d ( xxxg1806xxx ; a.k.a.  xxxg1806xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg1806xxx )
(schmidt et al., 1992; amri et al., 1995; jow and mukherjee, 1995), which provides a link between nsaid-mediated chemoprevention and the genetic alterations identified in colorectal tumors.
 xxxg1806xxx  belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily,
which includes the steroid hormone, thyroid hormone,
retinoid, and ppar subfamilies as well as a growing
number of orphan receptors (kastner et al., 1995;
mangelsdorf et al., 1995; lemberger et al., 1996). the
ppar subfamily comprises at least three distinct subtypes found in vertebrate species:  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , and
 xxxg1807xxx . the nuclear receptor family members function
as ligand-dependent sequence-specific activators of
transcription (mangelsdorf et al., 1995; lemberger et al.,
1996). we found that the nsaids  xxxd3259xxx  and indomethacin could mimic the effects of apc by downregulating the transcriptional activity of  xxxg1806xxx . this inhibition appeared to be due to disruption of the dna binding
ability of  xxxg1806xxx /rxr heterodimers. these observations
demonstrate that apc and nsaids inhibit a mutual target,  xxxg1806xxx , thereby providing a link between the genetic
alterations underlying tumor development and cancer
chemoprevention.
results
apc represses  xxxg1806xxx  expression
the effects of apc on gene expression were explored
using sage as previously reported (he et al., 1998a). in
brief, gene expression was examined in a human crc
cell line with inducible apc (ht29-apc) and a control
cell line with an inducible lacz gene (ht29-b-gal) 9 hr
after induction. sage analysis of 55,233 and 59,752 tags
from apc-expressing and control cells, respectively, led
to the identification of 14,346 different transcripts, the
majority of which were not differentially expressed. because biochemical studies have indicated that apc directly represses crt, we focused on the repressed
transcripts. one of the most highly repressed tags corresponded to  xxxg1806xxx  (24 tags in ht29-b-gal versus 5 tags
in ht29-apc).
to confirm the sage data, we performed northern
blot analysis of rna from ht29-apc and ht29b-gal
cells using ppar probes (figure 1a). repression of
 xxxg1806xxx  was evident as early as 3 hr after apc induction,
whereas no change was detectable in ht29 b-gal cells
even 9 hr after induction. in contrast, expression of

figure 1. expression of  xxxg1806xxx  in human crc cells
(a) decreased expression of  xxxg1806xxx  following induction of apc in
crc cells. expression of apc (ht29-apc) or b-galactosidase
(ht29-gal) was induced with (110 mm)  xxxd3556xxx  for the indicated times
in ht29 crc cells containing the respective genes under the control
of a modified metallothionein promotor. total rna (10 mg) was isolated and analyzed by northern blot analysis with probes specific
for  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx .
(b) increased expression of  xxxg1806xxx  in primary crcs. northern blot
analyses with probes specific to  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  were performed
on total rna (10 mg) isolated from matched primary crcs (c) and
normal colon epithelium (n) removed from four different patients.
(c) expression of  xxxg1806xxx  in crcs is dependent on tcf-4-mediated
transcription. crc cells with increased b-catenin/tcf-4-mediated
transcription due to either apc (sw480, dld1) or b-catenin
(hct116) mutations were either mock infected (con) or infected with
adenovirus expressing gfp (gfp) or a dominant-negative mutant of
tcf-4 (dntcf). total rna (10 mg) was isolated and analyzed by northern blot analysis with probes specific for  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx .

 xxxg1807xxx  was not affected by expression of apc, and the
other known ppar subfamily member,  xxxg1805xxx , was not
expressed at detectable levels (figure 1a and data not
shown). the ability of apc to repress  xxxg1806xxx  expression
suggested that expression of  xxxg1806xxx  should be elevated
in primary crcs, where crt is often increased by mutations in apc or b-catenin. northern blot analysis of
ppar expression in crcs and normal colorectal mucosa revealed a marked increase in  xxxg1806xxx  expression
in each of four cancers studied (figure 1b). in contrast,
there was no increase in  xxxg1807xxx  expression in the cancers of these patients (figure 1b).
apc inhibits crt of the  xxxg1806xxx  gene
to explore the basis for the repression of  xxxg1806xxx , we
isolated and sequenced a 3.1 kb genomic region upstream of the  xxxg1806xxx  transcription start site (genbank
accession #af187850) and used it to analyze apc responsiveness (figure 2). a luciferase reporter construct
containing this fragment (be) upstream of a minimal
promotor was markedly repressed by apc expression
(figures 2a and 2b). analysis of nested deletions and promotor fragments identified two apc-responsive frag-

(a)  xxxg1806xxx  promotor. a restriction map of the
3.1 kb region upstream of the first exon of
 xxxg1806xxx  is shown. restriction fragments be,
ne, he, de, bn, nh, hd, and np were used
to construct reporters for measuring apc and
b-catenin responsiveness. filled boxes represent potential tcf-4-binding sites, and open

mnp represents fragment np with both potential tcf-4-binding sites mutated. tre1 and
tre2 contain four repeats of the two tcf4-binding sites, respectively. mtre1 and
mtre2 are mutant forms of tre1 and tre2.
(b) the  xxxg1806xxx  promotor is repressed by apc
and dntcf. sw480 crc cells were transfected with the indicated  xxxg1806xxx  promotor
luciferase reporters (0.4 mg), with a b-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 mg pcmvb),
and with 1.0 mg of either a control (vector),
apc, or dntcf expression vector. luciferase
activity is reported relative to the vector control after normalizing for transfection efficiency through b-galactosidase activity. bars
represent the means of three independent
replicates with error bars representing the unbiased standard deviations.
(c) apc and dntcf responsiveness is mediated by two putative tcf-4-binding sites.
 xxxg1806xxx  promotor fragments with intact and
mutated tcf-4-binding sites were tested for
apc and dntcf-4 responsiveness as described in (b). bars represent the means of
three independent replicates, with error bars
representing the unbiased standard deviations.
(d) b-catenin transactivation maps to the
same promotor regions mediating apc and
dntcf responsiveness. 293 cells were transfected with the indicated  xxxg1806xxx  promotor
luciferase reporters (0.4 mg), with a b-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 mg pcmvb), and with 1.0 mg of either a no insert control (vector)
or an oncogenic b-catenin (b-catenin) expression vector. luciferase activity was reported as described for (b). bars represent the means of
three independent replicates, with error bars representing the unbiased standard deviations.
(e) putative tcf-4-binding sites in the  xxxg1806xxx  promotor bind tcf-4.  xxxd1543xxx  was performed using 32p-labeled probes containing either putative
tcf-4-binding sites tre1 or tre2.  xxxd1543xxx  was performed in the presence of a gst fusion protein containing the tcf-4 dna-binding domain
as indicated. wild-type (wt) or mutant (mut) competitors corresponding to the tcf-4-binding sites were used as indicated.

ments (fragment nh and hd, figures 2a and 2b). the
sequence of these fragments revealed two putative tcf4-binding sites, one (tre1) located 1543 bp upstream
of the  xxxg1806xxx  transcription start site in fragment nh and
the other (tre2) located 759 bp upstream in fragment
hd. a fragment spanning these two sites conferred
marked apc repression, which was completely abrogated by disruption of the putative tcf-4-binding sites
(np versus mnp, figure 2c). moreover, either of the
putative tcf-4-binding sites in isolation could confer
apc responsiveness in a sequence-specific manner
(tre1 versus mtre1, and tre2 versus mtre2 in figure 2c).
as noted above, an obvious basis for the apc responsiveness of  xxxg1806xxx  would be inhibition of crt. consistent with this, there was a perfect concordance between
the ability of apc to repress  xxxg1806xxx  promotor fragments (figures 2b and 2c) and the ability of oncogenic
b-catenin to induce transcriptional activity (figure 2d).
likewise, there was a perfect concordance between

apc responsiveness and the ability of a dominant-negative tcf-4 (dntcf) expression vector to inhibit transcriptional activity (figures 2b and 2c). as with apc responsiveness, the b-catenin transactivation and the dntcf
repression were abrogated by mutation of the putative
tcf-4-binding sites (figures 2c and 2d). the ability of
tcf-4 to directly bind to the  xxxg1806xxx  tre sites was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays
( xxxd1543xxx ). both putative binding sites demonstrated significant tcf-4 binding, which was inhibited by their cognate wild-type binding sequences but not by their mutant counterparts (figure 2e).
the above results suggested that apc repressed
 xxxg1806xxx  expression by interfering with crt and that alterations in this pathway could lead to increased expression of  xxxg1806xxx  in crcs. to further evaluate the generality
of this pathway, we examined the ability of dntcf to
interfere with  xxxg1806xxx  expression in other human crc
cell lines. like the ht29 cells in which  xxxg1806xxx  expression
was first identified (figure 1a), sw480 and dld1 cells

contain inactivating mutations of apc. hct116 cells
have an activating mutation of b-catenin. as expected
from the study of primary tumors (figure 1b),  xxxg1806xxx 
expression was detected in all the lines (figure 1c).
moreover,  xxxg1806xxx  expression was inhibited in each line
by infection with an adenovirus containing a dntcf expression cassette but not by a control adenovirus containing a gfp expression cassette (figure 1c). in contrast,  xxxg1807xxx  expression was barely detectable in
sw480 cells, and dntcf had no effect on  xxxg1807xxx  expression in any of the lines tested.
definition of  xxxg1806xxx -responsive elements
to explore the functional significance of  xxxg1806xxx  repression, we developed reporters for  xxxg1806xxx  function. although downstream targets of  xxxg1806xxx  are unknown,
studies of other ppar family members have defined a
prototypic response element. maximum dna binding
and activation are achieved through heterodimerization
between a ppar protein and rxr (gearing et al., 1993).
accordingly, the prototypic ppar response element
aco from the acyl-coa oxidase gene promotor contains
two copies of the core binding sequence aggtca
separated by one base pair (tugwood et al., 1992;
mangelsdorf et al., 1995; lemberger et al., 1996; jugeaubry et al., 1997).  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  bind this consensus efficiently, whereas  xxxg1806xxx  does not (see below).
to define a  xxxg1806xxx -responsive element, we performed
in vitro binding site selection for both  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx .
analysis of 28 binding sites selected with a  xxxg1998xxx  gst
fusion protein identified (a/g)ggtca as the core consensus for rxr (figure 3a). analysis of 20 sites selected
with a  xxxg1806xxx  gst fusion protein revealed a novel binding consensus (cgctcac), which was distinct from the
previously defined  xxxg1805xxx /g consensus (figure 3b).
the combination of the  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  consensus
sequences should form a  xxxg1806xxx -binding element in
vitro and a  xxxg1806xxx -responsive element in vivo. we
generated a putative  xxxg1806xxx -responsive element (dre,
59-cgctcacaggtca-39) by joining the  xxxg1806xxx - and
 xxxg1998xxx -binding sites.  xxxd1543xxx  analysis of dre revealed
binding to  xxxg1806xxx  gst fusion protein but not to  xxxg1805xxx 
or  xxxg1807xxx  gst fusion proteins (figure 3c). in contrast,
the prototypic ppar-responsive element aco (59-agg
acaaaggtca-39) bound  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  but not
 xxxg1806xxx  gst fusion proteins (figure 3c).  xxxg1998xxx  gst fusion protein demonstrated weaker binding to both responsive elements. to further test the specificity of
these elements, we performed  xxxd1543xxx  analysis with in
vitro translated  xxxg1806xxx /rara and  xxxg1807xxx /rara heterodimers in the presence or absence of ligand stimulation.
under the conditions used, binding of  xxxg1806xxx / xxxg1998xxx  and
 xxxg1807xxx / xxxg1998xxx  heterodimers to their cognate elements
could not be detected in the absence of ligand. however,
 xxxg1806xxx / xxxg1998xxx  binding to dre was markedly induced by
the  xxxg1806xxx  ligand cpgi, and  xxxg1807xxx / xxxg1998xxx  binding to
aco was induced by the  xxxg1807xxx  ligand  xxxd3147xxx  (figure 3d). in contrast,  xxxg1807xxx / xxxg1998xxx  heterodimers did not
bind dre in the presence of  xxxd3147xxx  nor did  xxxg1806xxx /
 xxxg1998xxx  bind aco in the presence of cpgi. to test the
specificity of these response elements in cells, we constructed luciferase reporters containing either the dre
or aco elements. transfection of 293 cells with  xxxg1806xxx 
resulted in activation of the dre reporter that was enhanced by cpgi (figure 3e) but did not activate the aco

reporter even in the presence of cpgi (figure 3f). in
contrast, expression of  xxxg1807xxx  did not activate the dre
reporter (figure 3e) but did activate the aco reporter
that was enhanced by brl 49653 (figure 3f).

 xxxg1806xxx  function is regulated by the apc/b-catenin/
tcf-4 pathway
the above findings suggested that  xxxg1806xxx  activity was
regulated by apc/b-catenin/tcf-4 pathway at the transcriptional level. to address the functional consequences of this transcriptional regulation in crc cells,
we used the  xxxg1806xxx -specific reporters described above.
transfection of apc into a human crc cell line resulted
in downregulation of the  xxxg1806xxx  reporter dre but had no
effect on the  xxxg1805xxx /g-responsive reporter aco (figure
4a). the lack of any effect on  xxxg1805xxx /g demonstrated
the specificity of this inhibition and made it unlikely that
the effects were due to nonspecific toxicity of a tumor
suppressor. transfection of a dntcf-4 expression vector
also specifically repressed the  xxxg1806xxx  reporter but not
the  xxxg1805xxx /g reporter. to further eliminate the possibility
of nonspecific toxic effects, we tested b-catenin’s ability
to positively regulate  xxxg1806xxx  activity. expression of oncogenic b-catenin mutants activated the  xxxg1806xxx  reporter but did not activate the  xxxg1805xxx /g reporter (figure 4b).

nsaids suppress  xxxg1806xxx  activity
suppression of colorectal tumorigenesis by nsaids
suggested that these compounds may be linked to the
genetic alterations that drive tumorigenesis. the identification of  xxxg1806xxx  as a target of the apc tumor suppressor
pathway suggested a specific link. both precursors and
products involved in eicosanoid metabolism have been
shown to be ligands for ppars (keller et al., 1993; yu
et al., 1995; forman et al., 1997; kliewer et al., 1997).
the ability of nsaids to perturb eicosanoid metabolism
suggested that ppars may be an ultimate target of
nsaids in suppressing tumorigenesis (prescott and
white, 1996), and the above findings suggest that  xxxg1806xxx 
could be a specific target. to explore this possibility,
we tested the effects of the nsaid  xxxd3259xxx  on  xxxg1806xxx 
function. as noted in the introduction,  xxxd3259xxx  has been
shown to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis in humans
and mice. in culture,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, the active metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx , has been shown to induce apoptosis in
crc cells (piazza et al., 1995; shiff et al., 1995; hanif
et al., 1996; chan et al., 1998).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide treatment
resulted in a dose-dependent repression of  xxxg1806xxx  activity in crc cells, as assessed with the dre reporter
(figure 4c). a greater than 2-fold repression was observed at low concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, and a
greater than 10-fold reduction was noted at levels of
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide that induced substantial degrees of
apoptosis in these cells (figures 4c and 5d). in contrast,
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide had only a modest effect (less than
25% repression at the highest concentration tested) on
 xxxg1805xxx /g activity, assessed with the aco reporter (figure 4c). a similar dose-dependent suppression of
 xxxg1806xxx  was observed with indomethacin, another nsaid
(figure 4c).

expression of  xxxg1806xxx  partially rescues  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide–induced apoptosis
if suppression of  xxxg1806xxx  activity were contributing to
 xxxd3259xxx -induced apoptosis, overexpression of  xxxg1806xxx 
might be expected to protect against  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide–
induced apoptosis. we constructed an adenovirus (adppard) expressing  xxxg1806xxx  and a green fluorescent protein (gfp) marker using adeasy technology (he et al.,
1998b). the ability of adppard to suppress  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide–induced apoptosis was compared to that of
adgfp, which contained only the gfp marker gene.
adppard produced nearly a 5-fold decrease in apoptosis in hct116 cells treated with 100 or 125 mm  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide (figures 5a–5d). similar results were obtained
with the sw480 cell line (figure 5d). however, the suppression of apoptosis could be overridden at higher
concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (150 mm, figure 5d).
the results were further confirmed and extended by the
ability of adppard to rescue inhibition of clonal cell
growth by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide. treatment of cells with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide resulted in a greater than 4-fold decrease in
the number of colonies (figure 5e). at 100 or 125 mm
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide but not higher doses, this decrease
could be completely rescued by infection with adppard, which actually resulted in a slightly increased
number (z15%) of colonies. in contrast, the apc target
and prototypic oncogene c-myc could not rescue the
 xxxd3259xxx -mediated inhibition of clonal growth.

figure 4.  xxxg1806xxx  activity is regulated by apc, b-catenin, and  xxxd3259xxx 
(a) apc and dntcf specifically repress  xxxg1806xxx  activity.  xxxg1806xxx  and
 xxxg1807xxx  activity was assessed with the dre and aco luciferase
reporters, respectively. sw480 crc cells were transfected with
the indicated luciferase reporters (0.4 mg of dre or aco), with a
b-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 mg pcmvb), and with 1.0 mg of
either a control (vector), apc, or dntcf expression vector. luciferase
activity was calculated as described in figure 2. bars represent the
means of three independent replicates with the error bars being the
unbiased standard deviations.
(b) b-catenin expression increases  xxxg1806xxx  activity. the 293 human
cell line was transfected with the indicated luciferase reporters (0.4
mg of dre or aco), with a b-galactosidase expression vector (0.2
mg pcmvb), and with 0.8 mg of either a no insert control (vector) or
an oncogenic b-catenin expression vector.
(c)  xxxd3259xxx  and indomethacin specifically repress  xxxg1806xxx  activity.
 xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  activity was assessed as transcriptional activity
of the dre and aco luciferase reporters, respectively. hct116 and
sw480 crc cells were transfected with the indicated luciferase
reporters (1.0 mg of dre or aco) and with a b-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 mg of pcmvb). cells were allowed to recover for 20
hr after transfection and then treated for 10 hr with the indicated
concentrations (mm) of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide or indomethacin. luciferase
activity was reported relative to the control (0) after normalizing for
transfection efficiency.

 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide disrupts the dna binding ability
of  xxxg1806xxx / xxxg1998xxx  heterodimers
to determine whether  xxxd3259xxx  could inhibit the transcription of  xxxg1806xxx  like apc, we examined expression
of  xxxg1806xxx  following  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide treatment. concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide that resulted in suppression
of  xxxg1806xxx  activity and apoptosis had no effect on the
level of  xxxg1806xxx  transcripts, excluding this possibility
(figure 6a). because ppars can bind eicosanoids (keller et al., 1993; yu et al., 1995; forman et al., 1997;
kliewer et al., 1997), the effects of nsaids on  xxxg1806xxx 
could be due to their ability to perturb eicosanoid metabolism. however, several studies (see discussion) have
suggested that the chemopreventive effects of nsaids
are not simply related to their ability to suppress prostaglandin synthesis. we therefore considered the possibility that nsaids directly inhibit  xxxg1806xxx  activity. this notion was supported by the ability of some nsaids to
activate  xxxg1805xxx /g (lehmann et al., 1997) and of indomethacin to alter the ligand responsiveness of tetr/
 xxxg1806xxx  fusion proteins (yu et al., 1995). we tested the
ability of  xxxd3259xxx  to inhibit cpgi-stimulated  xxxg1806xxx /
 xxxg1998xxx  heterodimer dna binding activity in vitro.  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide was able to inhibit binding of  xxxg1806xxx / xxxg1998xxx  heterodimers to the dre element (figure 6b). binding to dre
was also inhibited by the nsaid indomethacin and, at
higher concentrations, the  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide–related compound  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (figure 6b). the relative concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, indomethacin, and  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone required to inhibit binding to dre were roughly
concordant with the concentrations required to induce
apoptosis in crc cells, with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide being the
most potent and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone the least (figures 5d

(a–d)  xxxg1806xxx  inhibits  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide–induced apoptosis. hct116 and sw480 cells were either mock infected (uninfected) or infected with
adenovirus expressing gfp (adgfp) or  xxxg1806xxx  (adppard). twenty hours after infection, cells were treated for 42 hr with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide.

with crystal violet (upper panel) and enumerated (lower panel).

and 6b; data not shown). none of these drugs had any
effect on  xxxd3147xxx -stimulated binding of  xxxg1807xxx / xxxg1998xxx 
heterodimers in an analogous assay performed with the
aco element (figure 6c).
discussion
the above results demonstrate that  xxxg1806xxx  is a target
of both apc and nsaids and suggest a model of how
apc and nsaids operate to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis (figure 7). in most crcs, inactivating mutations
of apc lead to elevated levels of crt (korinek et al.,
1997; morin et al., 1997). in rare crcs without apc
mutations, b-catenin mutations that render it resistant to
apc-mediated degradation result in elevated b-catenin/
tcf-4-mediated transcription (morin et al., 1997). in either case, this increased b-catenin/tcf-4 activity leads

to increased transcription of growth-promoting genes.
accordingly, restoration of apc function to crc cells
with defective apc function results in growth suppression and apoptosis (morin et al., 1996). the genes that
have been postulated to mediate the growth-promoting
effects of b-catenin/tcf-4 activity include those encoded by the  xxxg1487xxx  (he et al., 1998a), the
 xxxg366xxx  gene (tetsu and mccormick, 1999), and others
(wisp, c-jun, and  xxxg811xxx ) (pennica et al., 1998; mann et
al., 1999). the present findings suggest that  xxxg1806xxx 
represents a b-catenin/tcf-4 target with particular importance for chemoprevention. whereas apc or b-catenin
mutations can result in increased  xxxg1806xxx  activity, nsaids
can compensate for this defect by suppressing  xxxg1806xxx 
activity and promoting apoptosis. this suppression of
 xxxg1806xxx  is mediated in part by the ability of some nsaids
to directly inhibit the dna binding activity of  xxxg1806xxx . in

figure 6. mechanism of suppression of  xxxg1806xxx  by nsaids
(a) nsaids do not affect  xxxg1806xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx , or  xxxg1998xxx  expression.
hct116 and sw480 cells were treated with the indicated concentration (mm) of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide for 36 hr, and rna was isolated. northern blot analysis was performed on 10 mg of total rna with a probe
specific for  xxxg1806xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx , or  xxxg1998xxx .
(b) nsaids suppress  xxxg1806xxx  dna binding. the dre-binding element
was 32p-labeled and incubated with no lysate (probe only) or in vitro
translated  xxxg1806xxx  (d),  xxxg1998xxx  ( xxxg1998xxx ), or both (d 1  xxxg1998xxx ).  xxxg1806xxx  1
 xxxg1998xxx  1 cpgi (10 mm) was included in all lysates treated with the
indicated nsaids. dna binding was assessed by  xxxd1543xxx , where
“probe” indicates the unbound probe and “shifted” indicates bound
probe.
(c) nsaids do not suppress  xxxg1807xxx  dna binding. the aco-binding
element was 32p-labeled and incubated with no lysate (probe only)
or in vitro translated  xxxg1807xxx  (g),  xxxg1998xxx  ( xxxg1998xxx ), or both (g 1  xxxg1998xxx ).
 xxxg1807xxx  1  xxxg1998xxx  1 brl 49653 (10 mm) was included in all lysates
treated with the indicated nsaids. dna binding was assessed by
 xxxd1543xxx , where “probe” indicates the unbound probe and “shifted”
indicates bound probe.

addition, because  xxxd2154xxx  and eicosanoids can act
as ligands and modifiers of ppar activity (keller et al.,
1993; yu et al., 1995; prescott and white, 1996; forman
et al., 1997; kliewer et al., 1997),  xxxg1806xxx  activity might
be repressed by the nsaid-mediated changes in eicosanoid metabolism.
the above model can help explain several features of
nsaid-mediated chemoprevention. first, the effectiveness of some nsaids in the prevention of colorectal
adenomas can now be linked to genetic defects that

underlie the initiation of these tumors and to the ability
of nsaids to counterbalance the consequences of these
genetic defects. second, although nsaid functions
have been linked to their inhibition of cox activity and
the resulting inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, several studies have suggested that the chemopreventive
and apoptosis-inducing activities of nsaids are not entirely related to the inhibition of cox or to the decreased
levels of prostaglandins (see introduction). these results
may be explained by the ability of nsaids to directly
inhibit  xxxg1806xxx . indeed, the  xxxd3259xxx  derivative  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone, which is devoid of cox inhibitory activity, has
apoptotic activity in vitro and chemopreventive activity
in vivo and has been proposed as a chemopreventive
agent that lacks the toxicity associated with traditional
nsaids (piazza et al., 1995, 1997; mahmoud et al., 1998).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibited  xxxg1806xxx  activity, albeit at
higher concentrations than that required for  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide, consistent with its reduced chemopreventive
and apoptosis-promoting activity. third, recent studies
have demonstrated that  xxxg1807xxx  agonists promote intestinal tumorigenesis in the min mouse (lefebvre et al.,
1998; saez et al., 1998), while the same agonists inhibit
the growth of human crc cells (brockman et al., 1998;
sarraf et al., 1998). although the conclusions of these
studies were contradictory, they clearly demonstrated
the ability of ppar ligands to modify intestinal tumor
growth. a role for ppars in intestinal tumorigenesis is
further suggested by the recent identification of lossof-function mutations in one allele of  xxxg1807xxx  in 4 of
55 sporadic crcs (sarraf et al., 1999). however, unlike
 xxxg1806xxx , neither  xxxg1807xxx  nor  xxxg1805xxx  is a target of the
apc/b-catenin pathway. whereas  xxxg1806xxx  is increased
in expression in cancers, downregulated by apc, and
upregulated by b-catenin,  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1805xxx  do not
display these properties. fourth, the ability of cox2
expression to modulate apoptosis (tsujii and dubois,
1995) and intestinal tumorigenesis (oshima et al., 1996)
may be partially related to its ability to alter the spectrum
of ligands for  xxxg1806xxx  and other ppars. in this regard,

 xxxg1806xxx  and chemoprevention
343

it is interesting to note that the  xxxg1806xxx  ligand cpgi can
partially rescue infertility resulting from cox-2 deficiency (lim et al., 1999). finally, the ability of dietary
 xxxd2154xxx  and secreted phospholipases to modify the
spectrum of  xxxg1806xxx  ligands and thus alter  xxxg1806xxx  activity
could account for their ability to affect crc risk (willett
et al., 1990; dietrich et al., 1993; macphee et al., 1995;
vanden heuvel, 1999).
in addition to explaining several features of nsaidmediated chemoprevention, our observations may have
important ramifications for the development of chemopreventive agents. in particular, it is conceivable that
the development of drugs that specifically target  xxxg1806xxx 
might lead to more efficacious and less toxic means for
crc chemoprevention.

constructions of  xxxg1806xxx  promotor reporters
three independent bac clones containing the  xxxg1806xxx  promotor
sequence were obtained by screening a bac library (research genetics). for the construction of  xxxg1806xxx  promotor reporters, corresponding restriction fragments (illustrated in figure 2a) were subcloned into pbv-luc. the mnp reporter was constructed by cloning
a pcr product into pbv-luc, whereas p4xtre1-luc, p4xmtre1luc, p4xtre2-luc, and p4xmtre2-luc were constructed from oligonucleotides. details of construction and oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request or at www.coloncancer.org/
ppar.htm.

experimental procedures

in vitro transcription and translation assays
the full-length proteins of  xxxg1806xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx , and  xxxg1998xxx  were generated by in vitro transcription-coupled translation of pcr products
using the tnt t7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system
(promega). pcr primer sequences are available upon request or at
www.coloncancer.org/ppar.htm.

cell lines and chemicals
human crc cells (ht29, hct116, sw480, and dld1) and embryonic
kidney cells (293) were obtained from atcc (manassas, va).
 xxxd3147xxx  and cpgi were purchased from american radiolabeled
chemicals and cayman chemical company, respectively.  xxxd3259xxx 
derivatives and indomethacin were purchased from biomol. unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo).
in vitro dna-binding site selection for  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx 
gst fusion proteins containing the n-terminal dna-binding domains
of human  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  were constructed by pcr amplifying
codons 1–249 of  xxxg1806xxx  and 1–224 of  xxxg1998xxx  and cloning them into
pgex-2tk vector. as controls, gst fusion proteins containing the
dna-binding domains of human  xxxg1805xxx  (aa 1–249) and  xxxg1807xxx  (aa
1–248) were also constructed. to identify the potential consensus
dna sequence motifs recognized by  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx , a previously
described in vitro site selection procedure was utilized (zawel et
al., 1998). selected pcr products were cloned in to pzero2.1, tested
for binding, and sequenced as described.
gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays
dna-binding assays supplemented with poly didc (6 mg/ml) were
performed essentially as described (zawel et al., 1998). for binding
to pcr products derived from in vitro site selections, 1.0–1.5 mg of
protein and 50 ng of dna were used. for competitions, a 100-fold
excess of unlabeled probe was used. for  xxxd1543xxx  with gst fusion
proteins, 0.3–0.5 mg of fusion protein and 0.5 ng of 32p kinase labeled
(z106 dpm) dna were used. the probes for tcf-4 binding were as previously reported (korinek et al., 1997). for  xxxd1543xxx  with in vitro translated proteins, 0.1 to 0.2 ml of programmed lysate and 32p-labeled
probe (z106 dpm) was used. the dre probe was formed by annealing 59-gcgtgagcgctcacaggtcaattcg-39 and 59-ccgaatt
gacctgtgagcgctcacg-39. the aco probe was formed by
annealing 59-gcggaccaggacaaaggtcacgttc-39 and 59-cga
acgtgacctttgtcctggtccg-39.
construction of a  xxxg1806xxx -responsive reporter
the following oligonucleotides containing  xxxg1806xxx  and rxr recognition motifs that were identified from in vitro site selection approach
were synthesized: 59-ctagcgtgagcgctcacaggtcaattcgg
tgagcgctcacaggtcaattcg-39 and 59-ctagcgaattgacct
gtgagcgctcaccgaattgacctgtgagcgctcacg-39. as a
control, the following oligonucleotides containing a  xxxg1805xxx  and
 xxxg1807xxx -responsive element from the acyl-coa oxidase promotor
were also synthesized: 59-ctagcggaccaggacaaaggtcacgt
tcggaccaggacaaaggtcacgttcg-39 and 59-ctagcgaacgt
gacctttgtcctggtccgaacgtgacctttgtcctggtccg-39.
the oligonucleotide cassettes were dimerized and cloned into pbvluc, a luciferase reporter plasmid with very low basal activity (he
et al., 1998a). all constructs were verified by dna sequencing.

reporter assays
reporter plasmid, effector plasmid, and b-gal control plasmid were
transfected into cells using lipofectamine (life technologies).
twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed and collected
for assays of luciferase activity using promega’s luciferase assay
system.

generation of recombinant adenovirus expressing  xxxg1806xxx 
or c-myc
a pcr product of human  xxxg1806xxx  was cloned into pcmv-haha
and verified by sequencing. this expression cassette was used
to generate recombinant adenovirus using the adeasy system as
previously described (he et al., 1998b). additional details of the
construction are available upon request or at www.coloncancer.org/
ppar.htm. admyc was generated in a similar fashion and was a gift
of h. hermeking.
