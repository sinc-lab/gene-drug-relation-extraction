abstract. using human and bovine corneal tissue, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of  xxxd340xxx  (17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor-prostaglandin f2 ethyl amide,  xxxd340xxx  (allergan, inc, irvine, ca).
enzymatic amidase activity, which converts  xxxd340xxx  to the corresponding prostaglandin carboxylic
acid, was found to be present in corneal tissue from both species. using hplc and mass spectrometry
for analyses, conversion of  xxxd340xxx  to 17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor prostaglandin f2 continued for at
least 24 hours after excision of the cornea, with a conversion rate of approximately 25 g/24 hours.
this hydrolysis product is identical to the free acid of  xxxd2446xxx  with the exception of a double, rather
than a single, bond at the carbon 13-14 position. assuming that this conversion also occurs in vivo at a
similar rate, this hydrolysis product may account for the reduction of intraocular pressure occurring in
patients treated with  xxxd340xxx . (surv ophthalmol 47(suppl 1):s34–s40, 2002. © 2002 by elsevier

prostaglandins in the eye were believed to be ocular
hypertensives and proinflammatory agents prior to the
pioneering work of bito and camras in 1977.3,6 subsequent studies by these authors and others demonstrated
that by selecting an appropriate f-series prostaglandin
analog and rendering it a lipophilic prodrug through
derivitization of the c-1 carboxyl group, potent and effective ocular hypotensive drugs were created.15,17 the
earliest of such drugs to be approved for the treatment
of glaucoma were xalatan5 (pharmacia corp, peapack,
nj) and rescula18 (ciba vision, atlanta, ga), followed
very recently by travatan16 (alcon pharmaceuticals, ft
worth, tx) and lumigan7 (fig. 1). these agents have
revolutionized the treatment of glaucoma in humans,
and they are poised to become the first line of drug therapy for this prevalent, sight-threatening disorder. a key
common feature of all these agents is the ability of the
parent prostaglandin carboxylic acid to stimulate prostaglandin fp receptors.1,2 although the exact mecha-

nism of the ocular hypotensive action of prostaglandins
is still subject to debate,  xxxg1878xxx  activation has generally been considered to be a pivotal step in the process.
unlike the other drugs mentioned above,  xxxd340xxx  acquires its lipophilic character through derivitization of c-1 as an ethyl amide, rather than the more
common isopropyl ester. it has further been claimed
that  xxxd340xxx  does not undergo hydrolysis to the
parent free acid in the eye, and that its mechanism of
action does not include the prostaglandin  xxxg1878xxx .20 we sought in this study to determine whether
prostaglandin c-1 amides are hydrolyzed to the parent
free acid in human and bovine corneal tissue.

hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  in corneal tissue

fig. 1. prostaglandin analogs approved
for glaucoma treatment.

all other prostaglandin standards were synthesized
in the organic chemistry department at cayman
chemical. human corneas were from the michigan
eye bank and were kindly provided by dr. bruce cohan. bovine corneas were from healthy animals and
were collected from the abattoir at the time of
death. all other reagents were of research reagent
grade and were from sigma or similar commercial
sources.
incubation/product analyses

corneas (human or bovine) were excised shortly
after death and immediately refrigerated to 0–4c;
corneas were utilized 6 to 48 hours later. the enzymatic activity of corneas older than 48 hours was absent or reduced, so experiments were run only on
fresh tissue. the corneas were placed into glass test
tubes containing 5 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffered
saline ([pbs], ph 7.4). control test tubes contained
only 5 ml of pbs (no cornea). 17-phenyl-trinor
pgf2 ethylamide ( xxxd340xxx ), pgf2 isopropyl ester, or another prostaglandin analog (250 g in 100 l
ethanol for human corneas, or 400 g in 200 l ethanol for bovine corneas) was added to one test tube
containing corneal tissue and one control test tube
containing only pbs. the test tubes were incubated
with gentle shaking at 37c. aliquots (2 ml) were
taken after 6 and 23 hours for testing. the reaction
mixture was acidified to ph 3 with 5% khso4, saturated with nacl, and extracted three times with 80%
ethyl acetate:hexane. the solvent was evaporated
under nitrogen and then brought up in 200 l of

80% ethyl acetate:hexane. the samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) on a reverse-phase c18 column (beckman;
ultrasphere, 5 , 4.6  250 mm) using methanol:water:acetic acid (70:30:0.1v/v) as the mobile phase at
a flow rate of 1 ml/min. the eluent was monitored
at 210 nm. analysis by thin layer chromatography
(tlc) was performed by spotting 5 l of the organic
phase extract on silica gel g-60 plates (analtech)
which were eluted with 95:5:1 ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid and developed by charring under
 xxxd3258xxx  spray.
mass spectrometry

mass spectrometry was carried out on a finnigan
mat lcq mass spectrometer. the human cornea hydrolyzed  xxxd340xxx  product was collected during
hplc and analyzed without derivitization. a mass
range of m/z 105–500 was scanned at the rate of 3
sec/scan using a negative ion electrospray lc/ms.
immunoblotting

immunoblotting was carried out according to the
standards of towbin et al.19 briefly, the resolved proteins from the acrylamide gel (12%) were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked
with 5% nonfat dry milk in 25 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0,
containing 137 mm nacl. the membrane was incubated with a specific antiserum to rat fatty acid
amide hydrolase raised in rabbits that was kindly
provided by dr. cecilia hillard at the medical col-

prostaglandin f2 free acid standard was evident.
these results were then extended by repeating the
experiment with analysis of the product by hplc,
which was at least five times more sensitive with respect to the detection threshold for prostaglandins
(2–3 g for tlc vs. 0.3–0.5 g for hplc). the
hplc analysis confirmed the presence of a new
prostanoid in 23-hour hydrolysis experiments, which
co-eluted with authentic 17-phenyl-trinor prostaglandin f2 free acid standard. by integrating the area
under the curve of the respective peaks, we estimated
the new product to represent approximately 8% of
the original amide prodrug, or 32 g of free acid active metabolite (average of three experiments).
human cornea hydrolysis

the products of the hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  using human corneas were analyzed by hplc and are
shown in fig. 3. the hydrolysis was qualitatively similar, but slightly more complete, with 10% (25 g) of
the active free acid metabolite present at 23 hours
(average of 4 experiments). in order to confirm the
identity of the new metabolite, which co-eluted with
17-phenyl-trinor prostaglandin f2 free acid, we collected the peak from the hplc analysis and analyzed it by mass spectrometry. the resulting spectrum, shown in fig. 4, is identical to 17-phenyl-trinor
prostaglandin f2 free acid and confirms that this
compound is the only major metabolite formed during incubation of  xxxd340xxx  with human cornea.

results
bovine cornea hydrolysis

the products of the hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  using bovine cornea were first analyzed by tlc and
are shown in fig. 2. within 6 hours of starting the incubation, and more noticeably at 23 hours, a new
product which co-migrated with the 17-phenyl-trinor

in order to investigate the structural requirements
of the amidase/esterase activity in the cornea, we
prepared various combinations of prostanoid core
structure and lipophilic group. the results are summarized in table 1. since we determined using  xxxd340xxx  that the hydrolysis was easily reproducible, with a variance of less than 10%, we performed
only a single hydrolysis experiment with each of the
new c-1 derivatives. although the numbers presented might be refined by further repetition, we are
comfortable that the general trend is clear. we
found that enzymatic activity was present which was
relatively insensitive to changes in the prostaglandin
parent compound, in that it accepted phenyl-substituted and n-alkyl substituted lower side chain analogs with equal avidity. isopropyl and methyl esters
were hydrolized well, but the monosubstituted nethyl amide (as in  xxxd340xxx ) was hydrolized at
only 10% of the rate for isopropyl esters. adding a
second n-ethyl group (17-phenyl trinor pgf2-n,ndiethyl amide) abolished any detectable substrate activity and led only to the recovery of unmetabolized
starting compound.

discussion
the hydrolysis of prostaglandin isopropyl esters in
the eye has been reported in numerous studies.5,11
however, the enzyme or enzymes responsible for
this hydrolysis have not been carefully studied or
characterized. woodward presented data showing
no detectable hydrolysis of  xxxd340xxx  in homogenized iris ciliary body over a 2.5-hour period.20 however, the analytical method woodward used was insensitive and would not have detected small
amounts of hydrolysis; further, the study used ciliary
body rather than cornea, which is the tissue thought
to activate the glaucoma prodrugs and the tissue
where the drug is first absorbed. termination of the
woodward study at 2.5 hours was certainly premature, since  xxxd340xxx  is a once-daily drug with well
documented ocular hypotensive effects 24 hours after dosing.
in this study, we have demonstrated that prostaglandin c-1 n-ethyl amides, like isopropyl esters, are
also hydrolized in the eye, in this case by corneal tissue. the human cornea contains sufficient amidase
activity to convert more than 25 g of  xxxd340xxx 
to the corresponding free acid in a 24-hour period.
since the normal dose of  xxxd340xxx  is 7.5 g per
day, this raises the possibility that a significant
amount of the free acid, 17-phenyl-trinor pgf2, is
produced in treated eyes. if as little as 0.01% of this
dose accumulated in the aqueous humor as the free
acid, the concentration (about 2 nm) would be sufficient to provide significant  xxxg1878xxx  occupancy.1

the iop-lowering effect of  xxxd340xxx  could therefore be entirely due to  xxxg1878xxx  activation. this
provides a more rational explanation of the iop-lowering effect of  xxxd340xxx  than that which has been
offered to date, since the alternate theory postulates
the existence of an undiscovered receptor for which
no clone, sequence, tissue distribution, or pharmacological profile is known.7 analysis of the aqueous
humor of  xxxd340xxx -treated patients for the free
acid metabolite will be necessary to further support
this hypothesis.
the ability of the primate eye to convert both ester and amide prodrugs to their corresponding free
acid metabolites has been well documented.4,13 however, the identity of the specific enzyme(s) responsible, and a detailed structure-activity relationship
(sar) has not been published. table 1 shows the results of a very limited sar evaluation of this hydrolytic activity. both methyl and isopropyl esters of
pgf2 are converted almost quantitatively to the free
acids by the cornea within 24 hours. the enzyme(s)
responsible for this conversion seem relatively insensitive to the structure of the pgf analog, in that
extended omega chains, (unoprostone isoproplyl ester) and phenyl-substituted ( xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx ) analogs are converted with about the same efficiency as the parent prostaglandin, pgf2. the amide
analogs, in contrast, show a clear impairment of hydrolysis compared to the ester prodrugs. hydrolysis of the
amides is also markedly inhibited by n-alkyl groups.

spectrum obtained using an authentic
sample of 17-phenyl-trinor-pgf2 (a).

the amide nitrogen decreases the already inefficient
hydrolysis by 50%, and a second n-ethyl ligand completely abolishes it.
 xxxg753xxx  ( xxxg753xxx ) is a recently
discovered enzyme with both amidase and esterase
activity.8,10  xxxg753xxx  functions biologically to metabolize and inactivate the two primary endocannabinoids, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (aea, anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-ag).9,14 cravatt
et al have shown that  xxxg753xxx  is relatively non-discriminating as to the size and degree of unsaturation in
the fatty acid component of potential amide substrates, which supports our findings in table 1.8 the
cannabinoid receptors cb1 and cb2 on which these
endocannabinoids act are present in the eye, making it seem plausible that the deactivating enzyme

 xxxg753xxx  would also be present.12 interestingly, one of
these compounds is an amide (aea) and the other
(2-ag) is an ester. it is possible that  xxxg753xxx  is the single enzyme present in ocular tissues which is responsible for the activation of all prostaglandin prodrugs.
a recent report of  xxxg753xxx  expression in rat ocular tissues found expression in several retinal cell types;
however, these authors did not investigate the cornea.21 we performed immunoblots with fresh, homogenized human cornea using a peptide antibody
raised against the rat  xxxg753xxx  sequence, and transfected hek cells expressing the human  xxxg753xxx  protein as a positive control, shown in fig. 5. a clear
band of immunoreactivity with the expected mr of
57 kda has been tentatively identified as human
 xxxg753xxx .12 current studies in our lab seek to confirm
