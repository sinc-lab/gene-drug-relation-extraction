the familial prevalence of brugada syndrome (brs) in a consecutive series of patients was
prospectively determined. brs is genetically determined with autosomal dominant transmission. the familial prevalence of the brs is unknown. a detailed pedigree of each family
of patients with brs was assembled and permission was obtained to invite relatives for
electrocardiography and an  xxxd96xxx  challenge. sixty-two of 98 patients participated in the
study and were included over a 6-year period.  xxxg2028xxx  genotyping was performed in 56 of
these 62 patients (90%). electrocardiograms (ecgs) of 488 relatives (mean age 38 ⴞ 20
years, 45% men) were recorded and 270 of these relatives agreed to undergo an  xxxd96xxx 
challenge. spontaneous type 1 brs ecg was found in 4 of 488 relatives (0.8%). in the
group of relatives in whom  xxxd96xxx  challenge was performed (n ⴝ 270), the finding was
positive in 79 subjects (29%).  xxxg2028xxx  genotyping identified 5 other affected relatives. as a
result, the total number of affected relatives was 88. standard 12-lead ecg was normal in
64 of the 88 affected relatives (73%). mean percentage of affected relatives per family was
27 ⴞ 32% (95% confidence interval 19 to 35). familial forms of brs were observed in 41 of
the 62 families (66%) and no  xxxg2028xxx  mutations were found in sporadic forms. in conclusion, after active family screening affected relatives were found in almost 1/3 of subjects.

the prevalence of the familial form of brugada syndrome (brs) has not been thoroughly assessed. one study
reported a 36% rate of familial forms of brs.1 patients are
usually identified sporadically. the existence of effective
therapies, in particular implantable cardioverters– defibrillators (icds) or quinidine,2,3 justifies family screening to
allow the diagnosis in symptomatic relatives. it may also be
important to identify asymptomatic carriers because the risk
of arrhythmia is increased in situations such as fever,4,5
electrolyte imbalance, or absorption of a large range of
drugs.6 in patients presenting with brs on electrocardiogram (ecg), the discovery of other carriers in the family
eliminates an acquired cause for the electrocardiographic
abnormality. the yield of systematic family screening is not
known and its clinical value has not been clearly demonstrated for asymptomatic patients because risk stratification
is still controversial.7,8 the aim of this prospective study
was to examine the familial prevalence of brs in all unrelated patients with brs followed in our center.

methods
this study was conducted from 2001 to 2007 according
to french guidelines for genetic research and was approved
by the local ethics committee. a detailed pedigree of the
families of each patient with brs was assembled and permission was obtained from the proband to invite relatives to
undergo screening. subjects were given information about
the risks of brs and the availability of effective prophylactic
or therapeutic strategies that might be indicated in some
subjects. written informed consent was obtained from each
family member. investigation included review of medical
history, complete physical examination, and 12-lead ecg.
patients were considered “symptomatic” when they presented documented unexplained syncope, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. unexplained sudden cardiac death (scd) was defined as a death
occurring ⬍1 hour after onset of symptoms in a patient with
no underlying cardiac disease or occurring during sleep. in
relatives ⬎15 years of age with a normal or type 2 or 3 brs
ecg,9 an  xxxd96xxx  (1 mg/kg) challenge was proposed. in
view of the risk of arrhythmias, as recommended by rolf et
al,10 injection of  xxxd96xxx  was performed over 10 minutes
and stopped at significant j-point increase or widening of
the qrs interval by ⬎130%.
brs ecg was defined by the presence of coved stsegment elevation ⱖ0.2 mv (type 1 ecg).9 first-degree
relatives included parents, offspring, and siblings. screened
relatives consisted of relatives in whom an  xxxd96xxx  challenge was not contraindicated or relatives belonging to a
family in which a  xxxg2028xxx  mutation had been found in the

proband. affected relatives were defined by the presence of
spontaneous or drug-induced type 1 brs ecg and/or same
 xxxg2028xxx  mutation as the proband. familial forms were defined by the presence of another family member with proved
brs or carrying the same  xxxg2028xxx  mutation as the proband.
sporadic forms were defined as families with no identified
family members with brs. electrophysiologic studies were
performed in symptomatic relatives with spontaneous or
drug-induced type 1 ecg. asymptomatic relatives with
type 1 brs ecg were also investigated until 2006.7,8 annual ecgs were advised in asymptomatic patients with
drug-induced type 1 ecg. patients were provided with a list
of drugs able to induce brs ecg.
genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was purified from blood
samples treated with ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid by
standard methods. molecular characterization of the mutation was performed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
followed by direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing of
pcr products using the primers described by wang et al.11
subsequent sequencing reactions of the complete  xxxg2028xxx 
coding sequence and the exon–intron junctions were performed using the bigdye terminator v3.1 kit (applied
biosystems, foster city, california). pcr products were analyzed
using the abiprism tm 3100 genetic analyzer (applied
biosystems). the 3= untranslated region including the polyadenylation signal was also sequenced.
data were analyzed with spss 10 (spss, inc., chicago,
illinois). chi-square and student’s t tests were performed
when appropriate to test for statistical differences. analysis
of variance was used for multiple comparisons. a p value
⬍0.05 was considered statistically significant.

14 for familial sudden death) that demonstrated inducible
ventricular fibrillation in 6 subjects. four of these relatives
received hydroquinidine and 2 received an icd. no arrhythmic event occurred during follow-up. five of 16 patients
(31%), from 3 different families, presented with  xxxg2028xxx 
mutation (r1913h, f2004l, r1193q) but did not have a
positive finding from the  xxxd96xxx  challenge. these patients
were significantly younger than those with a positive finding
from the  xxxd96xxx  challenge (19 ⫾ 12 vs 45 ⫾ 13 years,

a  xxxg2028xxx  mutation was identified in the proband had a
positive finding from the  xxxd96xxx  challenge but no  xxxg2028xxx 
mutation. in each of these families, the finding from ajma-

line challenge was positive in the proband’s 2 parents, but
the  xxxg2028xxx  mutation was present in only 1 parent. one of
these 2 families has been previously reported.12
familial forms were found in 66% of subjects. characteristics of sporadic versus familial forms are listed in table 3.
 xxxg2028xxx  mutations found in the study population are listed in
table 4. no  xxxg2028xxx  mutations were found in sporadic
forms. twenty-two of the 41 familial forms included 2

standard ecg. familial forms were common (66%) and no
 xxxg2028xxx  mutations were found in sporadic forms.
sixty-three percent of probands agreed to inform their
relatives and 89% of relatives participated in the study.
psychological difficulties in discussing the disease with a
close relative could be a reason for nonparticipation. a
“family letter” explaining the disease and the objectives of
screening can be used to inform families. according to a
study by van der roest et al13 performed in subjects with
potentially inherited arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy, probands gave the family letter to their relatives in 88% of
cases. nevertheless, in their study, relatives were subsequently referred to a cardiologist in only 57% of cases. the
proportion of participating relatives appears to be larger
when they are informed orally and contacted after obtaining
permission from the proband. the family letter method may
be more appropriate for probands who refuse or hesitate to
inform their relatives. probands who definitively refuse to
inform their families raise a difficult ethical issue. the risk
is low in asymptomatic patients; the most recent estimates
of the annual risk of an arrhythmic event are 0.5% to 3%.7,14
however, the annual risk of an arrhythmic event is higher
(1.5% and 3.51%) in subjects with a history of syncope.8,14
due to the risk of life-threatening complications in symptomatic patients and the availability of effective prophylactic strategies, it would appear appropriate to legally require
information of relatives and preserve a proband’s privacy.
a larger prevalence of affected relatives was observed in
this study than in the literature (31% vs 7.6% to 15%).15,16
management of affected relatives is still debated but mainly

1761

depends on the presence of symptoms. for those with a history
of unexplained syncope or spontaneous type 1 ecg, treatment
may consist of icd or quinidine.2,3,9 however, most detected
relatives had a normal ecg and were asymptomatic. they
were detected only because of the  xxxd96xxx  challenge. these
relatives were informed about the symptoms and need for
follow-up. systematic treatment of hyperthermia may be indicated because fever has been described to trigger severe ventricular arrhythmia.4,5 drugs such as class ic antiarrhythmics,
 xxxd383xxx , antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, propofol, or cocaine should be avoided.6 this study was not designed to assess the value of family screening to prevent
arrhythmic events in asymptomatic relatives. due to the small
number of symptomatic relatives detected and the absence of a
control population, the value of active family screening could
not be demonstrated. the large number of relatives found to be
carriers of the disease indicates that this type of assessment
would be feasible.
as in the study by priori et al,17 penetrance based on
electrocardiographic analysis was low in this study because
84% of gene carriers had a normal ecg. this result emphasizes the fact that, in clinical practice, family screening
should include an  xxxd96xxx  challenge before excluding the
disease. due to phenotypic heterogeneity, this test may not
always be sufficient because some relatives may have a
 xxxg2028xxx  mutation and a negative finding with the  xxxd96xxx 
challenge. this situation was observed in 36% of subjects in
our study and 24% to 85% in previous reports.17,18 various
factors such as age,19 gender,20 systematic recording of a
precordial lead in the second intercostal space during  xxxd96xxx  challenge,21 and existence of overlapping syndromes22,23
may account for the observed differences.
as in a study from probst et al,24 we observed families in
which subjects exhibited the phenotype of brs but without
the familial mutation. probst et al suggested that  xxxg2028xxx 
mutations did not have a direct causal relation with brs
ecg and that genetic background may play a powerful role.
in 2 subjects in the present series, this surprising finding was
attributed to the presence of the phenotype in the 2 parents,
whereas only 1 parent had the  xxxg2028xxx  mutation. in this
situation, offspring or siblings may have the brs phenotype
without the familial  xxxg2028xxx  mutation.
we found a prevalence of 66% of familial forms after active
screening. in a study performed in 44 unrelated index patients,
familial forms of brs were found in only 37% of families.1 in
a recent report, the prevalence was even lower at 26.7% of
familial cases.16 the screening performed did not include analysis of  xxxg2028xxx  mutations, which may account for the observed
differences. thirty-eight percent of patients with a familial
form of brs presented with a  xxxg2028xxx  mutation, whereas no
 xxxg2028xxx  mutations were observed in sporadic cases in a study
by schulze-bahr et al.1 our observations were similar. ecg
also more frequently showed type 2 brs in sporadic forms
(table 3). other nongenetic factors may account for some
sporadic forms. importantly, a similar prevalence of scd was
observed in these families (25%) as in the meta-analysis by
paul et al7 (range 0% to 55%, mean 11%) with no differences
between familial and sporadic forms, in accordance with the
finding that a history of scd in a family has a limited value for
risk stratification.8,15

despite active screening of families, not all probands
agreed to participate in the study and inform their relatives.
recruitment was therefore not exhaustive. one-half (6 of
12) of  xxxg2028xxx  mutations observed has been previously
linked to brs (figure 2). this study did not examine
whether the other 6 mutations were associated with an in
vitro modification of the transmembranous sodium current.
nevertheless, the  xxxg2028xxx  mutation rate observed in this
study (18%) is identical to that reported in the literature.
some mutations have been reported in long qt syndrome
and brs and may be the expression of different forms of
overlapping syndromes.25
