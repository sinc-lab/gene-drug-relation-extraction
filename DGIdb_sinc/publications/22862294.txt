abstract: starting from the structure of  xxxd358xxx  (1), we embarked on a medicinal
chemistry program aiming at the identiﬁcation of novel potent dual endothelin receptor
antagonists with high oral eﬃcacy. this led to the discovery of a novel series of alkyl sulfamide
substituted pyrimidines. among these, compound 17 ( xxxd2529xxx ,  xxxd2529xxx ) emerged as
particularly interesting as it is a potent inhibitor of eta with signiﬁcant aﬃnity for the etb
receptor and shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and high in vivo eﬃcacy in
hypertensive dahl salt-sensitive rats. compound 17 successfully completed a long-term phase
iii clinical trial for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

introduction
over the past decade, our understanding of the function of
endothelin (et) has evolved from describing it as a purely
vascular factor regulating blood pressure1−4 to recognizing it as
a hormone inﬂuencing many cellular processes such as
proliferation, apoptosis, and migration leading to tissue
hypertrophy, remodeling, ﬁbrosis, and inﬂammation.5−7 the
three structurally closely related peptides, named  xxxg674xxx 
(et-1), endothelin-2 (et-2), and  xxxg675xxx  ( xxxg675xxx ), are
among the most potent vasoconstrictors known in humans.
they convey their action through binding to two g-protein
coupled receptors called eta and etb. among the three
isopeptides, et-1 appears to be the key player in the
cardiovascular system. et-2 and  xxxg675xxx  are speciﬁcally expressed
in the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, respectively.8,9 on
the vascular side, eta receptors are mainly expressed on
smooth muscle cells, mediating vasoconstriction, while etb
receptors expressed on endothelial cells and smooth muscle
cells cause vasodilation and vasoconstriction, respectively. in
addition, a wealth of tissue cells such as cardiomyocytes, renal
cortex, and medulla cells, ﬁbroblasts, macrophages, and neurons
produce et-1 and/or express the two et receptors, illustrating
that the et system is not conﬁned to the vasculature only.9−11
cross talk and receptor heterodimer formation has been
proposed for the two et receptors.6,12−15 both eta and etb
receptors are involved in mediating et-1 deleterious eﬀects in
diseases such as chronic heart failure, idiopathic pulmonary
ﬁbrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, or kidney disease.6,7,10,16 furthermore, in many pathological situations, the
et system is up-regulated and a change in the eta/etb

expression ratio in favor of etb is observed in diseased
tissue.11,17−19 several studies corroborate that increased activity
of the et system in tissue correlates with disease severity.20,21
a large number of synthetic endothelin receptor antagonists
have been investigated preclinically, and several small molecule
inhibitors have been studied in clinical trials for chronic heart
failure, hypertension, cancer, and ﬁbrosis.5,22−27 today, the
dual eta/ xxxg677xxx  antagonist  xxxd358xxx  (1, figure 1)28−30
and the eta selective antagonist (s)-2-((4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)oxy)-3-methoxy-3,3-diphenylpropanoic acid ( xxxd138xxx )31−33 are approved treatments for pulmonary arterial
hypertension.

accessible by treating the respective sulfonyl chloride (e.g., 6)
with ammonia, followed by potassium tert-butylate in methanol,
while the necessary dichloro-pyrimidines were obtained as
described in the literature.40,42−46 the monochlorides such as 5
were treated with a freshly prepared solution of sodium in
ethylene glycol at elevated temperatures to give the
corresponding alcohols (e.g., 7). the alcohols were dissolved
in thf and deprotonated with 2.5 equiv of sodium hydride
and reacted with the respective 2-chloro- or 2-(methylsulfonyl)
pyrimidines at elevated temperature. as reported earlier,47 these
pyrimidines are either commercially available or prepared
according to literature procedures.48−52 final products such as
8 were obtained in good yields as white to beige powders after
crystallization from methanol.

when we initiated our medicinal chemistry program to
identify a follow-up compound to sulfonamide 1 (figure 1), we
decided that compound 1 should not only serve as the
structural starting point for our quest for novel endothelin
antagonists but should also represent the benchmark against
which we gauge our novel compounds. a candidate suitable for
clinical development needs to meet the following requirements:
(1) the compound has to show a signiﬁcantly increased
potency on the  xxxg676xxx  when compared to compound 1.
(2) the compound should block the  xxxg677xxx  in vivo. (3)
the compound needs to demonstrate oral eﬃcacy superior to
the one of compound 1 as assessed by measuring arterial blood
pressure in conscious hypertensive dahl salt-sensitive rats.34−36
(4) pharmacokinetic properties assessed in animals must
support once daily dosing in humans. (5) the compound
should easily distribute into tissue in order to also reach et
receptors expressed in the tissue. (6) because compound 1
inhibits the canalicular  xxxg11xxx ,37 a candidate
compound must be devoid of bile salt transport inhibition.
in the paragraphs below, we describe our eﬀorts aimed at
identifying a compound that meets all of the above criteria.

results and discussion
synthesis. the following description of the synthesis of a
prototypical sulfonamide (scheme 1) and sulfamide (scheme 2
and 3) endothelin receptor antagonist shall illustrate the
general approach chosen to prepare the compounds discussed
in this manuscript.
the preparation of the sulfonamide derivatives was carried
out as previously described38−42 and usually started by reacting
a dichloro-pyrimidine building block43,44 (e.g., 3) with a
sulfonamide potassium salt (e.g., 4) in dmso at room
temperature to give the monochloro-pyrimidine intermediate
(e.g., 5). the sulfonamide potassium salts were readily

a

by reacting chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (9) dissolved in dichloromethane at 0 °c with 1 equiv of  xxxd3319xxx  to give the bocprotected amino-sulfonyl-chloride (10), which was subsequently added slowly to a solution of 1 equiv of the respective
amine (e.g., n-propylamine) in the presence of 3 equiv of
triethylamine in dichloromethane at 0 °c. the mixture was
stirred overnight to drive the reaction to completion and was
then concentrated. the residue was dissolved in a large volume
of ethyl acetate. to avoid extraction of the boc-protected
sulfamides such as 11 into water, reagents and salts were
removed by washing the ethyl acetate solution very carefully
with a small volume of water and brine only. the organic
extract was dried, and the sulfamide 11 was isolated by
evaporating the solvent. this material was dissolved in
approximately 5 m hcl in dioxane to aﬀect boc-deprotection.
after stirring the mixture at room temperature for 4−8 h, the
solvent was evaporated to give sulfamide 12. the potassium salt
13 was obtained by dissolving 12 in methanol followed by the
addition of potassium tert-butylate and subsequent evaporation
of the solvent. puriﬁcation of the potassium salt 13 was
achieved by trituration in diethylether and drying under high
vacuum. overall yields of the above process were good to
excellent.
synthesis of the sulfamide based endothelin receptor
antagonists followed the preparation of the corresponding
sulfonamide analogues. as an example, the preparation of
sulfamide 17 is outlined in scheme 3. hence, reacting a
dichloro-pyrimidine building block (e.g., 1442) with a sulfamide

observed that such an additional pyrimidine ring improves the
aﬃnity for eta and etb signiﬁcantly. compound 1 derivative
18, for instance, is about 10 times more potent on eta and
about three times more active on etb than compound 1 itself.
a similar trend was observed with the pair of phenylethane
sulfonamides 19 and 20. interestingly, also the weakly active
methane sulfonamide derivative 21 proﬁts from the introduction of a pyrimidine ring, and the resulting compound 22 is
almost 10 times more potent on both eta and etb than
compound 21. we therefore had a closer look at the structure−
activity relationship (sar) of this additional pyrimidine moiety.
while various substituents were tolerated in the 5-position of
the pyrimidine, substituents in positions 4 and/or 6 clearly
hampered the compound’s aﬃnity for the et receptors. this is
illustrated with some examples of the phenylethane sulfonamide series compiled in table 2. a comparable sar, however,
was observed with other scaﬀolds. compared to the
unsubstituted pyrimidine derivative 20, the 5-methyl analogue
23 is less potent on both receptors. on the other hand, a 5chloro (24), 5-bromo (8), 5-methoxy (25), 5-methylthio (26),
and a 5-triﬂuoromethyl (27) substituent all led to a similarly
improved aﬃnity for eta. while the bromo-, methoxy-, and
triﬂuoromethyl substituent improved the potency on etb only
slightly, a 5-methylthio group increased the compound’s aﬃnity
for this receptor signiﬁcantly. the 5-cyclopropyl substitutent in
28 reproduced the proﬁle of its unsubstituted analogue 20. as
illustrated with compound 29, a 4,6-disubstitution pattern
yielded only poorly active compounds.
on the one hand attaching a 5-bromo or a 5-methylthiopyrimidine to the ethylene glycol moiety brought us closer to
our goal of identifying endothelin antagonists more potent than
compound 1. on the other hand, these new compounds
contain ﬁve aromatic rings and have a molecular weight well
above 600 g/mol and therefore certainly do not qualify as lean
molecules. in view of this, we carefully scrutinized the three
substituents attached to positions 2, 4, and 5 of the core
pyrimidine for possibilities to reduce the molecule’s size. for
these studies, we kept the 5-bromo-pyrimidine residue at the

potassium salt such as 13 in dmso at room temperature for
24−48 h gave the monochloro-pyrimidine intermediates (e.g.,
15). the ethylene-glycol side chain was introduced by applying
similar conditions as described for the synthesis of the
sulfonamides. alternatively, the monochloride (e.g., 15) was
added to a mixture of 3 equiv of potassium tert-butylate and
about 40 equiv of ethylene glycol in dimethoxyethane. these
mixtures were usually heated to 90−100 °c for 24−70 h to
furnish the corresponding alcohols (e.g., 16) in yields of 70−
90%. the ﬁnal step, the attachment of the substituted
pyrimidine, was performed as described for the sulfonamide
derivatives in scheme 1. for the preparation of compound 17,
2-chloro-5-bromo-pyrimidine was used. in general, the target
compounds could be puriﬁed easily by recrystallization from
methanol.
in vitro sar discussion. inspired by the structure of
tanabe’s clinical development compound n-(6-(2-((5-bromopyrimidin-2-yl)oxy)ethoxy)-5-(p-tolyl)pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (t-0201, 2)53

ethylene glycol constant. the compounds listed in table 3
document the sar of the sulfonamide part in position 4.
tables 4 and 5 illustrate the inﬂuence of the substituents in
position 2 and 5, respectively.
in a ﬁrst step, we removed the tert-butyl group attached to
the benzene sulfonamide moiety. this resulted in a 10-fold loss
of aﬃnity for both et receptors. when a ch2 group was
introduced as linker between the phenyl ring and the sulfur to
give compound 32, a further loss of aﬃnity was observed.
interestingly, moving the phenyl two ch2 units away from the
sulfonamide moiety (compound 8) restored the compound’s
aﬃnity completely for the  xxxg676xxx  and partially for the
et b receptor. the aﬃnity proﬁle of phenyl-propane
sulfonamide 33 is very similar to the one of the ethane
analogue 32. these observations combined with our aim to
reduce molecular weight prompted us to study compounds
lacking a phenyl ring in the sulfonamide part. not unexpectedly
though, the methane sulfonamide derivative 34 showed only
moderate potency on the  xxxg676xxx . much to our delight,
however, the ethane sulfonamide 35 was almost as potent as
the much bulkier phenylethane sulfonamide 8. as shown with
compounds 36 and 37, the aﬃnity for eta improves steadily
with increasing length of the alkyl chain. no such trend was
observed with the  xxxg677xxx . in a next step, we prepared a
number of compounds wherein the sulfonamide moiety was
replaced by a sulfamide group. as illustrated with compounds
38−43, these novel sulfamide derivatives represent potent et
receptor antagonists. only the morpholine derivative 44 shows
some loss of aﬃnity toward the two receptors. compared to
the corresponding sulfonamides, the sulfamides have almost
identical aﬃnity for the  xxxg676xxx  (e.g., compare 8 with 38,
35 with 39, 36 with 40, 37 with 41). in contrast to the
sulfonamide series, however, the ic50 value for the etb
receptor improves with increasing length of the sulfamide
alkyl chain. more importantly, the sulfamides show a trend
toward improved potency on etb. this observation clearly
moved the sulfamides into the focus of our interest. for the

and 30−37 represent sulfonamides, while compounds 38−44
represent sulfamides.

following studies, we selected sulfamide 38 as a reference
compound. hence, while keeping the benzyl sulfamide moiety
constant, we prepared a series of analogues with diﬀerent
substituents in position 2 of the core pyrimidine. several
examples are compiled in table 4. the pyrazine (45) and
morpholine (47) derivatives showed an aﬃnity proﬁle almost
identical to the one of the pyrimidine analogue 38. the
pyridine derivative 46, on the other hand, lost potency, in
particular on the  xxxg677xxx . as illustrated with compounds
48 and 49, the loss in aﬃnity is clearly more pronounced for
the 2-cyclopropyl (48) and the 2-methoxy (49) substituted
pyrimidine scaﬀolds. the 2-methoxy−ethoxy substituent in
compound 50 led to a small loss in aﬃnity for both receptors
when compared to 38. interestingly, complete removal of the
substituent in position 2 of the core pyrimidine (51)
reproduced the aﬃnity proﬁle of compound 50, suggesting
that the contribution of the 2-substituent to the binding aﬃnity
is small. this encouraged us to further evaluate the sulfamide
series with scaﬀolds lacking a substituent in position 2 of the
core pyrimidine. we therefore prepared a number of 2unsubstituted pyrimidine derivatives incorporating a selection
of 5-substituents that were known to lead to potent et
receptor antagonists.53−58 some examples are compiled in
table 5. as shown with compounds 52 and 53, a 3methoxyphenoxy rather than a 2-methoxyphenoxy substituent
led to an increase in potency on eta but left the aﬃnity for
etb unchanged. an unsubstituted phenyl ring directly bound
to the core pyrimidine as in 54 had no impact on eta aﬃnity

in brief, the sar studies discussed so far have shown that:
(1) introduction of a 5-bromo- or 5-methylthiopyrimidine to
the ethylene glycol improves the compound’s aﬃnity for both
et receptors signiﬁcantly (table 1 and 2). (2) the bulky 4tert-butyl benzene sulfonamide in compound 1 can be replaced
by a benzyl or alkyl sulfamide moiety (table 3). (3) sulfamide
derivatives are more potent on etb when compared to the
corresponding sulfonamide analogues (table 3). (4) a 2substituent at the core pyrimidine is not mandatory to obtain
potent et antagonists (table 4). (5) a 3-methoxyphenoxy, 4methylphenyl, 4-chlorophenyl, or 4-bromophenyl residue
attached to position 5 of the core pyrimidine leads to potent
et receptor antagonists (table 5).
in vivo eﬃcacy assessment. in a next step, we assessed
in vivo the oral eﬃcacy of some of the most potent examples
listed in table 5. for this purpose, we measured the blood
pressure lowering eﬀect following oral administration by gavage
of 3 mg/kg of each compound in conscious hypertensive dahl
salt-sensitive rats equipped with telemetry.59−61 in this model,
eﬃcient blockade of the et receptors results in a signiﬁcant
reduction of mean arterial blood pressure.35 the pharmacological response was quantiﬁed by calculating the area between
the curves (abc) of the blood pressure recordings 24 h before
and after treatment. as this experiment allowed for rapid and
reliable assessment of the in vivo eﬃcacy, we did not measure
pharmacokinetic properties prior to pharmacological testing. in
all experiments, the heart rate remained unaﬀected (data not
shown). at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg, compound 1 maximally
reduced mean arterial blood pressure by −7 ± 4 mmhg. the
duration of action was about 15 h, which translated into an
abc of −88 mmhg·h (n = 8) (table 5). a maximal reduction
of mean arterial blood pressure by −30 ± 3 mmhg was
achieved with a dose of 100 mg/kg. at this dose, compound 1
was active for about 72 h and displayed an abc of −896
mmhg·h (n = 5).

but caused a signiﬁcant loss in the activity on etb. introducing
a methyl group (55), or a chlorine (56) or bromine (57) atom
to the para position of the phenyl ring improved the
compounds’ aﬃnity for both receptors signiﬁcantly. introducing even larger alkyl groups, as shown with compounds 58 and
59, did not improve the compound’s aﬃnity any further. in fact,
both compounds showed a clearly reduced potential to block
the  xxxg677xxx .

this time the bromo-phenyl derivatives in table 6 are often less
potent when compared to their analogues in table 3 (e.g., 38 vs
57, 43 vs 64). notable exceptions are compounds 17 and 62,
which both retain their etb aﬃnity.
when we tested the sulfamides of table 6 in our rat model of
hypertension, compounds incorporating a rather small alkyl
sulfamide showed excellent in vivo activity (e.g., 60, 61, 17).
the propyl-sulfamide 17 emerged as a particularly interesting
compound as it combined high in vivo eﬃcacy with high
potency on etb. we therefore extended our study to the three
propyl sulfamides incorporating a 4-chlorophenyl (66), a 3methoxyphenoxy (67), or a 6-chloro-3-methoxyphenoxy (68)
substituent in position 5 of the core pyrimidine (table 6). the
in vitro activity of compound 66 was inferior to the one of
compound 17 as it was clearly less potent on etb. while the 3-

as apparent from the in vivo data given in table 5,
compounds incorporating a 3-methoxyphenoxy (52), 2-chloro5-methoxyphenoxy (53), a 4-chlorophenyl (56), or a 4bromophenyl (57) substituent at position 5 of the core
pyrimidine clearly exceeded the in vivo activity of compound 1.
at this point, we decided to evaluate sulfamides with a 4bromophenyl substituted pyrimidine scaﬀold in more detail.
several examples prepared for this study are listed in table 6.
for the  xxxg676xxx , the 4-bromophenyl derivatives reproduce
the relative sar observed with the corresponding 2methoxyphenoxy analogues (table 3) on a higher potency
level (e.g., 39 vs 60, 40 vs 61, 44 vs 65), and several
compounds reach aﬃnities below 1 nm. with respect to etb,
the relative sar between the 4-bromophenyl derivatives and
the 2-methoxyphenoxy-analogues is again similar. however,

methoxyphenoxy derivative 67 was only slightly less potent
than 17, the chloro substituted analogue 68 was more potent
on etb. however, both compounds 67 and 68 showed a clearly
lower activity in vivo. a comparison of sulfamide 17 with
sulfonamides 69 and 70 conﬁrmed our earlier ﬁnding that the
sulfamides present a signiﬁcantly higher aﬃnity for the etb
receptor. in our context, the sulfonamides 69 and 70 are
therefore clearly less attractive despite their high in vivo activity
in the dahl salt-sensitive rat model of hypertension (table 6).
in brief, the n-propylsulfamide derivative 17, later named
 xxxd2529xxx ,62 fulﬁlled the requirements we set forth at the
beginning of our discovery program. sulfamide 17 is highly
potent on the  xxxg676xxx  with signiﬁcant aﬃnity for the etb
receptor and maximally reduces mean arterial blood pressure
for at least 60 h at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg (figure 3).
following a dose−response experiment, maximal reduction of
mean arterial blood pressure by −25 ± 6 mmhg was reached
with a dose of 3 mg/kg (figure 4). no change in heart rate was
observed over the range of 1−100 mg/kg in conscious dahl
salt-sensitive rats (figure 3, data not shown). in a multiple dose
experiment, dahl salt-sensitive rats were treated for ﬁve
consecutive days with 1 mg/kg/day of 17 (figure 5). mean
arterial blood pressure was stably reduced by −20 mmhg over
the whole treatment period and returned to baseline about 48 h

after the last dose was given. no signs of tachyphylaxis were
observed, and no rebound eﬀect manifested at the end of the
study as blood pressure values returned to baseline.
in view of the excellent pharmacodynamic behavior of
compound 17, it came as no surprise that 17 also showed
favorable pharmacokinetic properties (table 7). in an iv
experiment with male wistar rats, the compound showed a low
plasma clearance of 6.7 ml/min·kg translating into a half-life of
5.1 h. the volume of distribution reached 1.8 l/kg, indicating
that the compound is distributing well into tissues. at an oral
dose of 10 mg/kg, compound 17 reached a peak plasma
concentration of 1670 ng/ml at 6 h after administration. oral
bioavailability was 69%. a similar pharmacokinetic behavior was
found in the dog, emphasizing the compound’s attractiveness
for further development. in the dog, compound 17 was rapidly
(tmax = 2 h) and almost completely (f = 87%) absorbed and
reached plasma concentrations close to 5000 ng/ml after oral
administration of 10 mg/kg. clearance and half-life are
comparable in rat and dog.
in the course of our pk studies we discovered that
compound 17 is metabolized to the depropylated sulfamide
71 (figure 6). this compound represents a major metabolite
reaching plasma exposure levels 4−5 times higher than that of
17. sulfamide 71 binds to the eta and etb receptors with ic50
values of 3.4 and 987 nm, respectively and therefore clearly
adds to the pharmacological activity of the parent compound
17.62 as we learned later, metabolite 71 is also formed in
humans.63 interestingly, oral administration of 10 mg/kg of the
butyl analogue 62 to wistar rats also led to signiﬁcant plasma
concentrations (cmax = 4100 ng/ml at 6 h after administration)
of sulfamide 71.
in 10.9% of the patients treated with compound 1, a
transient, dose dependent increase in serum liver aminotransferase levels of >3 times the upper limit of normal is
observed.64−66 mechanistically, this observation has been
attributed to the ability of compound 1 to inhibit bile salt
transport in hepatocytes, eventually leading to intrahepatic
cholestasis.37 minimizing the interaction of a potential followup compound with hepatic bile acid transport has therefore
been a further goal of our optimization eﬀorts. several
compounds have been assessed for their potential to interact
with bile salt transport in a rat model,37 and compound 17
showed no sign of bile salt transport inhibition in this model
(data not shown).

conclusions
in conclusion, starting from the structure of compound 1, we
have discovered a novel series of highly potent et receptor
antagonists. while these novel compounds are still based on a
pyrimidine core, the tert-butyl benzene sulfonamide part of
compound 1 has been replaced by a series of simple alkyl
sulfamide moieties. when compared to the corresponding
sulfonamides, these novel sulfamides are characterized by an
enhanced aﬃnity for the  xxxg677xxx , rendering them a
particularly interesting class of novel et receptor antagonists.
in addition, many of these sulfamides show high oral eﬃcacy in
reducing arterial blood pressure in conscious hypertensive dahl
salt-sensitive rats. in vivo dealkylation of the alkyl sulfamide
moiety in compounds 17 and 62, for instance, to the
pharmacologically active sulfamide 71 is another interesting
feature of the sulfamide class as it leads to sustained
pharmacological activity.
sulfamide 17 emerged as a highly attractive candidate for
further studies and can be characterized as a potent eta
receptor antagonist with signiﬁcant aﬃnity for the etb
receptor. in rat and dog models, the compound is well
absorbed, distributes well into tissue, and is slowly cleared,
suggesting that it is suitable for once daily dosing in humans.
recently published data on a phase i clinical trial with
compound 17 conﬁrm these expectations.63 in hypertensive
dahl salt-sensitive rats, 17 eﬃciently and dose dependently
reduced the arterial blood pressure. more detailed studies with
sulfamide 17 on its tissue penetration and ability to block the
eta and  xxxg677xxx  in vivo have been described in a separate
publication.62 in a rat model, compound 17 did not increase
plasma bile salt concentrations. compound 17 successfully
completed a phase iii clinical trial for pulmonary arterial
hypertension recently.67 a phase iiib clinical trial for digital
ulcers68,69 and a phase i/ib trial for recurrent glioblastoma70 are
currently ongoing.

endothelin receptor inhibition. binding assays were performed
in 96-well plates with cho membranes containing the recombinant
eta or etb receptors in 200 mul of 50 mm tris-hcl, 25 mm mncl2, 1
mm edta ph 7.4, 0.5% bsa, 2.5% dmso. the wells containing 0.5
mug/well of eta membranes or 0.2 mug/well of etb membranes were
incubated for 2 h at rt with 15 pm [125i]et-1 (10000 cpm) in the
presence or absence of test substances. minimum and maximum
binding was derived from samples with and without 1 mum of unlabeled
et-1, respectively. after the 2 h incubation period, the membranes
were ﬁltered through gf/c ﬁlterplates (multiscreen mahfc  xxxd3023xxx 
from millipore), which had been pre-equilibrated with binding buﬀer,
using cold 50 mm tris hcl, 0.1% bsa ph 7.5. after drying of the
ﬁlterplates, 25 mul of scintillation cocktail (microscint 20, perkinelmer) were added to each well and the ﬁlterplates were counted in a
microplate counter (topcount, canberra packard s.a. zürich,
switzerland). ic50 values were calculated as the concentration of
antagonist inhibiting 50% of the speciﬁc binding of et-1. two
reference compounds were tested: bq-123, a speciﬁc eta antagonist,
and sarafotoxin 6c (bachem, switzerland), a speciﬁc etb antagonist.
for these reference inhibitors, the following ic50 values were found
(geometric mean values): eta mb, 20.5 nm (n = 13) for bq-123 and
>100 nm (n = 10) for sarafotoxin; etb mb, 0.208 nm (n = 12) for
sarafotoxin and >1000 nm (n = 12) for bq-123.
telemetric in vivo studies.59−61 in vivo eﬃcacy of the compounds
was assessed by oral administration of 3 mg/kg of the compound
suspended in 5% arabic gum to female hypertensive dahl salt-sensitive
rats equipped with a telemetric system recording the arterial blood
pressure and heart rate. for both of these parameters, each rat served
as its own control by using the data of the last 24 h before treatment.
an area between curve (abc) was calculated between the control and
the treatment period to assess the compound’s eﬃcacy. maximal mean
arterial blood pressure reduction was extracted from the moving
average over 6 h of the blood pressure recordings.
pharmacokinetics in the rat. the pharmacokinetic proﬁle was
determined in the male wistar rat (n = 5). for this purpose,
compound 17 was formulated as a solution in 50 mm aqueous
 xxxd3449xxx  (tris) ph 8.3 buﬀer containing 45%
peg400 for intravenous administration at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg, and as
a microsuspension in 7.5% aqueous modiﬁed gelatin for oral dosing at
10 mg/kg. blood samples were taken at regular time intervals over a
period of 24 h from a preimplanted catheter, and plasma was
generated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 °c. plasma
concentrations were determined using a speciﬁc and sensitive lcms/ms method with a limit of quantiﬁcation of 1.5 ng/ml.
pharmacokinetics in the dog. the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of
compound 17 was determined in male beagle dogs (n = 3). the
compound was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a solution
in peg400 and intravenously at a dose of 1 mg/kg as a solution in
25% n-methylpyrrolidone (nmp), 25% peg400, 50% 50 mm
