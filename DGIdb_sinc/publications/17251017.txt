abstract—n-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-a-d -glucopyranosylamine, a promising topical antiglaucoma agent, is a potent inhibitor of the
zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1). the high resolution x-ray crystal structure of its adduct with the target isoform
involved in glaucoma, ca ii, is reported here. the sugar sulfanilamide derivative binds to the enzyme in a totally new manner as
compared to other ca–inhibitor adducts investigated earlier. the sulfonamide anchor was coordinated to the active site metal ion,
and the phenylene ring of the inhibitor ﬁlled the channel leading to the active site cavity. the glycosyl moiety responsible for the high
water solubility of the compound was oriented towards a hydrophilic region of the active site, where no other inhibitors were
observed to be bound up to now. a network of seven hydrogen bonds with four water molecules and the amino acid residues
pro201, pro202 and gln92 further stabilize the enzyme–inhibitor adduct.  xxxd3400xxx , another sugar-based ca inhibitor, binds
in a completely diﬀerent manner to ca ii as compared to the sulfonamide investigated here. these ﬁndings are useful for the design
of potent, sugar-derived enzyme inhibitors.

the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca, ec
4.2.1.1) catalyzes a very simple but critically important
physiological reaction: the interconversion between carbon dioxide, generated in huge amounts in all metabolic
processes, and the bicarbonate ion.1–6 inhibitors of these
zinc enzymes show a multitude of applications as
diuretic, antiglaucoma, antiobesity or antitumour drugs,
and are also used as diagnostic tools.1–6 various ca

diﬀerent isozymes of the 15 presently known in
humans.2–6 in all of them, the inhibitor is bound as an
anion to the catalytically critical zn2+ ion, also participating in extensive hydrogen bond networks and van
der waals interactions with amino acid residues in both
the hydrophobic and hydrophilic halves of the enzyme
active site.7–15 among the three main classes of potent
ca inhibitors (cais) described up to now, the sulfonamides, the sulfamates and the sulfamides, the ﬁrst one is
the most investigated one, since classical, clinically used
drugs such as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3,  xxxd1872xxx  4,  xxxd1931xxx  5 and
 xxxd367xxx  6 all belong to it.1–6
x-ray crystal stuctures are available for adducts of several isozymes (i.e., ca i, ii, iv, v, xii and xiv)7–14
mainly with sulfonamides, with some sulfamates and
few sulfamides (including the simplest such derivatives,

sulfamic acid and h2nso2nh2),10 providing clear
information on zinc coordination pattern in these
enzymes as well as in the corresponding enzyme-inhibitor complexes. x-ray crystallography of ca–inhibitor
adducts is in fact quite useful for drug design not only
of this class of biologically active compounds, but also
for investigating a much wider range of metalloenzyme
inhibitors.15 thus, constantly, novel sulfonamide derivatives are synthesized and investigated as inhibitors of
various enzymes in the search of compounds with selectivity for some of the many physiologically relevant isoforms, since the clinically used drugs 1–6 unselectively
inhibit many isozymes and as a consequence show many
undesired side eﬀects.1–6 for example, the ﬂuorescent
sulfonamide 7, recently reported by our group, is in
clinical development as an imaging agent, allowing the
precise imaging of acute hypoxic tumours that are
non-responsive to classical chemo- and radio-therapy.7,16
on a totally diﬀerent research area, we have also reported a series of sugar-sulfanilamide derivatives with potent
topical antiglaucoma activity in an animal model of this

disease.17 the most promising compound of that series,
the glucose derivative 8, was shown to be a strong inhibitor of the key isozyme involved in glaucoma formation,
that is, hca ii (h means human isoform), with an inhibition constant of 23 nm.17 the compound was also
shown to be highly water soluble and could be formulated as  xxxd2216xxx   xxxd3336xxx , which is not a straightforward property
for sulfonamides, that are usually very poorly water soluble compounds. in order to understand at the molecular level the strong inhibitory activity of this compound
against the target isoform involved in glaucomagenesis,
and also for learning more regarding the possibility of
using such data to obtain even more eﬀective enzyme
inhibitors with the desired physico-chemical properties,
we here report the high resolution x-ray crystal
structure (at 1.55 å) of the adduct of hca ii with the
sugar sulfonamide derivative 8. a structural comparison
with  xxxd3400xxx  9, another interesting sugar derivative
possessing good ca inhibitory activity and very
interesting biological activity, being a clinically used
antiepileptic,15 is also reported.  xxxd3400xxx  possesses a

protected-fructose scaﬀold and a sulfamate zinc binding
function. it has been proved earlier9b that this compound is a potent inhibitor of several ca isozymes,
and its binding to hca ii has been investigated by
means of high resolution x-ray crystallography.9b
despite the synthesis of a vast multitude of ca inhibitors utilising the tail strategy 1–4 and the potential beneﬁts of appending carbohydrate moieties to drug
molecules, the combination of these two strategies to
generate cais is essentially unexplored—there are just
two literature examples17,18 reporting this type of compounds, that is , our initial report of sulfanilamide-based
inhibitors, to which various sugar moieties have been attached by reaction of monosaccharides with sulfanilamide in the presence of ammonium chloride,17 and a
newer example, in which a rather large number of sugar
sulfonamide cais were obtained by means of click
chemistry.18 indeed, using a ‘click-tail’ approach a novel
class of glycoconjugate benzene sulfonamides of types
10–17 have been synthesized that contain diverse carbohydrate-triazole tails. such compounds were shown to
act as excellent cais against the isoforms ca i, ii
and ix, also possess desired physico-chemical properties, such as good water solubility.18 thus, this relatively
untouched medicinal chemistry landscape has served as
the primary inspiration for the x-ray crystallographic
investigation reported in this study regarding the interaction of a sugar–sulfanilamide derivative with the main
ca isozyme, hca ii, which might be important for a
better understanding of the drug design of sugar-containing sulfonamide cais.

the hca ii–8 complex was prepared and crystallized as
previously reported for other sulfonamide/sulfamate ca
inhibitors.1–6 the three-dimensional structure was analyzed by diﬀerence fourier techniques, the crystals being
isomorphous to those obtained for the native enzyme,19
and reﬁned using the cns program.20 the statistics
for data collection and reﬁnement are summarized in

the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme was very
similar to that of hca ii without any ligand bound,19 as
judged by an rms deviation for ca atoms of 0.36 å only.
examination of the initially calculated electron density
maps in the active-site region showed clear evidence
for the binding of the inhibitor within the active site
cavity (fig. 1).
the analysis of the active site environment showed that
the tetrahedral geometry of the zn2+ binding site and
the key hydrogen bonds between the sulfonamide
moiety of the  xxxd1178xxx  and enzyme active site were
all retained with respect to other hca ii–sulfonamide
complexes for which x-ray structures have been reported.1–6 in particular, the nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide moiety of the inhibitor coordinated the catalytic
zn2+ ion and displaced the hydroxide ion present in
the native enzyme. in addition, this nitrogen was also
involved in a hydrogen bond with the oh group of
thr199 (2.76 å), which was in turn hydrogen bonded
to the carboxylate of glu106 (2.56 å). one of the
oxygen atoms (o1) of the sulfonamide moiety accepted
a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of thr199
(thrn–o1 = 2.90 å), whereas the other one (o2) was
semi-coordinated to the catalytic zn2+ ion (zn2+–
o2 = 3.04 å), as observed in other hca ii–sulfonamide
adducts.7–15 the phenyl ring of the inhibitor ﬁlled the
active site channel of the enzyme wherein its atoms
established strong van der waals interactions (distance
<4.5 å) with the side chains of gln92, val121,
leu198, thr200 and pro202 (fig. 2). the sugar moiety
of 8, which is the most characteristic part of this
inhibitor, as no other sugar sulfonamide adduct has
been crystallized up to now with any ca isoform, as a
consequence of its highly polar nature was oriented
towards the hydrophilic part of the active site funnel
(fig. 3), where it was stabilized by several polar interactions with amino acid residues/water molecules. thus, a
strong hydrogen bond was observed between the o7

1729

(fig. 2). among these, the most notable one was the
hydrogen bond network involving the o4 hydroxyl
group of 8, the water molecule w454, the n2 nitrogen
atom of the inhibitor and the pro201 carbonyl group.
speciﬁcally, a strong hydrogen bond (of 2.75 å) was evidenced between the pro201 carbonyl group and the
water molecule w454, which in turn interacted both
with the n2 (3.00 å) and o4 (3.04 å) atoms of the
 xxxd1178xxx . finally a number of van der waals interactions with residues asn67, ile91, gln92, phe131 and
pro202 also contributed to stabilize the binding of the
glycopyranosyl ring in this region of the enzyme active
site. all these interactions were never before observed
in any ca–inhibitor adduct characterized by means of
x-ray crystallography.

atom of the glycopyranosyl ring and the gln92ne2
atom (o7–gln92ne2 = 2.88 å). besides this interaction, several hydrogen bonds involving the other
hydroxyl groups of the glycopyranosyl ring and water
molecules located in the active site were also observed

as the most structurally related compound to 8 among
the ca inhibitors investigated crystallographically up
to now is the sugar sulfamate  xxxd3400xxx , 9, we compared the binding of compounds 8 and 9 (both of them
being strong ca ii inhibitors)9b,17 to this enzyme.
figure 4 shows a structural overlay of  xxxd3400xxx  9, a
sulfamate ca inhibitor,9b and the sulfonamide inhibitor
8 investigated here, both of them bound within the hca
ii active site, as determined by the superposition of the
enzyme active site residues. it may be observed that
these two sugar-containing ca inhibitors show a very
diﬀerent binding mode to the enzyme. whereas  xxxd3400xxx  9 compactly binds within the active site in the close
vicinity of zinc (almost ﬁlling it completely due to its
quite bulky tricyclic ring structure), and interacting with
residues asn62, gln92 and thr200 (and a water molecule),9b the binding of sulfonamide 8 is quite diﬀerent
(fig. 4), with the phenylsulfonamide part of the

molecule occupying the central channel of the enzyme,
but the glucosyl moiety extending towards the hydrophilic half of the active site. in this region, very few

inhibitors were observed to bind up to now, after analyzing most of the ca–inhibitor adducts deposited in
pdb,14 and this may lead to important consequences
for the drug design of such agents. indeed, the type of
interactions observed in the hcaii–8 adduct has never
been reported up to now in other hca ii–inhibitor complexes, and they may explain the potent inhibitory activity of 8 towards this isozyme on one hand, and on the
other one, they can be used for the rational drug design
of other sugar-based ca inhibitors. in fact, exploiting
the binding of inhibitors in the hydrophilic half of the
active site, eventually correlated with the presence in
their molecule of other moieties which may extend
towards the hydrophobic part (where most of the other
sulfonamide ca inhibitors investigated earlier were
shown to bind),7–15 may lead to compounds with an
even better inhibitory activity. it must also be mentioned
that the sulfonamide/sulfamate zinc binding groups of
the two compounds 8 and 9 are very much superimposable in the two structures (fig. 4) proving once again
that potent ca inhibitors may be obtained both from
the sulfonamide, sulfamate (and of course sulfamide)
classes of derivatives.
in conclusion, n-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-a-d -glucopyranosylamine, a potent inhibitor of several ca isozymes,
was also shown to be a promising antiglaucoma agent
with topical activity in an animal model of the disease.
in order to understand the strong enzyme inhibitory
activity of this sugar derivative, the high resolution xray crystal structure of its adduct with the target isoform
involved in glaucoma, ca ii, was determined and reported in this work. this sugar sulfanilamide derivative
bound to the enzyme in a totally new manner as compared
to other ca–inhibitor adducts investigated up to now.
thus, the sulfonamide zinc binding anchor and the phenyl ring of the inhibitor bound in the expected way, that is,
being coordinated to the metal ion, and ﬁlling the channel
of the enzyme cavity, respectively. however, the glycosyl
moiety responsible for the high water solubility of the
compound was oriented towards the hydrophilic region
of the active site, where other inhibitors were never observed to be bound up to now. a relay of seven hydrogen
bonds with four water molecules and the amino acid
residues pro201, pro202 and gln92 further stabilized this
enzyme–inhibitor adduct. the only other sugar derived
ca inhibitor for which the x-ray crystal structure was
reported in adduct with ca ii, the antiepileptic sulfamate
 xxxd3400xxx , was shown earlier to bind in a completely
diﬀerent manner to the enzyme as compared to the sulfonamide investigated here. these ﬁndings may be useful for
the design of tight-binding, sugar-derived enzyme inhibitors with applications in therapy.

2.5 m (nh4)2so4, 0.3 m nacl, 100 mm tris–hcl (ph
8.4) and 5 mm of 4-(hydroxymercurybenzoate) to improve
the crystal quality. crystals appeared after 2–3 days at
22 °c and were isomorphous to those of the native enzyme
belonging to the space group p21 with unit cell parameters
of a = 42.07 å, b = 41.12 å, c = 72.06 å and b = 104.51°.
x-ray diﬀraction data were collected at synchrotron source
elettra in trieste, using a mar ccd detector, at 100 k. a
cryoprotectant solution was made by inclusion of 15% (v/v)
glycerol in the reservoir solution. data were indexed and
reduced with denzo and scalepack modules of the
hkl suite.21 native hca ii crystallized in the p21 space
group containing the active-site zinc ion without any water
molecule (1ca2.pdb)19 was used as the starting model for
rigid body reﬁnement followed by energy minimization
and isotropic thermal factor (b-factor) reﬁnement within
cns 1.0.20 clear density for the inhibitor was observed
in the diﬀerence map after this single round of reﬁnement
(r-free = 0.335; r-factor = 0.311). introduction of the
inhibitor and alternating cycles of addition of water,
manual rebuilding and energy minimization and b-factor
reﬁnement gave a ﬁnal model with r-free = 0.197 and rfactor = 0.176. the statistics for reﬁnement are summarized in table 1. coordinates and structure factors have
been deposited in the brookhaven protein data bank
(accession code 2hl4).
