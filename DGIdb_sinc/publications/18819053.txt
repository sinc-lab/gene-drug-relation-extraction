spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  are widely used
as mineralocorticoid antagonists. spironolactone
has several nonspecific actions including inhibition of  xxxg183xxx  and steroid hormone
biosynthesis. while studies have shown that
 xxxd2010xxx  does not exhibit nonspecific actions
on  xxxg183xxx , its eﬀects on steroid
hormone production have not been reported.
herein, the eﬀects of  xxxd2010xxx  (0.1–30 m)
and spironolactone (0.1–30 m) on steroid production were examined in human adrenocortical
h295r cells. spironolactone inhibited basal production of cortisol (91 %) and aldosterone (53 %).

there is increasing evidence that aldosterone can
have an eﬀect on vascular remodeling, collagen
formation, and endothelial function in addition
to its eﬀect on blood pressure [1–5]. a role for
myocardial  xxxg1602xxx  (mr) in
cardiac function is also highlighted by the
improvement of heart failure and cardiac fibrosis
when the expression of mr is downregulated [6]
and the susceptibility to arrhythmias is overexpressed [7]. similarly, heterologous expression of
11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, which
allows aldosterone to occupy cardiac mr in the
myocardium of transgenic mice, also leads to
dilated cardiomyopathy [8]. these actions of the
mr contribute substantively to the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, and progressive
renal dysfunction [9]. this insight has spurred
interest in new treatment strategies to block the
mr and the deleterious eﬀects of aldosterone,
not just because of its diuretic eﬀect, but prima-

tion by 11-fold. spironolactone inhibited ang ii
stimulation of aldosterone production by 80 %.
addition of pregnenolone increased aldosterone (9-fold) and cortisol (3-fold) production.
spironolactone inhibited pregnenolone metabolism to aldosterone (67 %) and cortisol (74 %). the
inhibitory eﬀects of spironolactone occurred at
concentrations far higher than those needed to
block  xxxg1602xxx , suggesting an
action directly on the enzymes involved in steroid production. in contrast,  xxxd2010xxx  did not
inhibit basal, ang ii,  xxxd1742xxx , pregnenolonestimulated cortisol, or aldosterone production.
together, these data demonstrate that opposed
to spironolactone, pharmacologic concentrations
of  xxxd2010xxx  do not inhibit adrenal cell aldosterone or cortisol production.

rily because of its potential cardiovascular and
renal protective eﬀects [10–12].
several important clinical trials support the cardioprotective eﬀects of aldosterone blockade in
patients with heart failure, such as the randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study (rales) [13]
and the  xxxd2010xxx  post-ami heart failure eﬃcacy and survival study (ephesus) [14]. although
spironolactone ( xxxd3238xxx ) is an eﬀective antialdosterone agent, its widespread use in humans
is limited by its tendency to produce undesirable
side-eﬀects. doses of spironolactone above
100 mg per day are a significant cause of impotence and gynecomastia in men [15, 16]. these
adverse eﬀects are primarily due to the binding
of spironolactone to androgen receptors and are
a substantial cause of drug discontinuation [17].
in prolonged spironolactone-treated patients,
spironolactone bodies were detected in the zona
glomerulosa of human and the adrenal cortex of
rat, although its functional significance remains
to be elucidated [18, 19]. there is, however, considerable evidence that spironolactone inhibits

were added at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 30 m. after
an additional incubation of 6 h, the cells were lysed and assayed
for luciferase activity (promega, madison, wi) and -galactosidase activity (tropix, bedford, ma, usa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a fluostar optima microplate
luminometer (bmg labtech, inc, nc, usa). relative level of
transactivation was calculated by dividing luciferase units by galactosidase units.

statistical analysis
each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times with
three replicates within each experiment. mean values from each
experiment were analyzed and compared to basal control values
using the anova test with the sigmastat 3.1 software package
(spss, chicago, il). results were considered significantly diﬀerent when p value was ≤ 0.05. the concentration of ligand that
resulted in 50 % of maximal activation of mr (ec50) was calculated using graphpad prism 4 software package (graphpad software, inc, ca, usa).

cell culture
h295r human adrenocortical tumor cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagles/ham’s f12 medium (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, usa) supplemented with 10 % cosmic calf serum
(hyclone, logan, ut, usa) and antibiotics. quantification of cell
number was accomplished using a z1 series coulter counter
(beckman, ca, usa). spironolactone, ang ii, aldosterone, and  xxxd1742xxx  were obtained from sigma.  xxxd2010xxx  was generously
provided by pfizer (new york, ny, usa).

steroid assays

the anti-mr eﬃciency of spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  was
tested using a cell culture model expressing mr and a mr-luciferase reporter. both antagonists successfully suppressed aldosterone-stimulated mr reporter activity; however, spironolactone
was a more potent mr blocker than  xxxd2010xxx  (䊉䉴 fig. 1). the
ec50 values of spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  were 0.04 m and
2 m, respectively.
to examine the eﬀects of sprironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  on
adrenal cell steroid production, h295r cells were incubated for
24 h with and without the mr antagonists. spironolactone (0.1–
30 m) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the basal
production of both cortisol (91 % at 30 m) and aldosterone (53 %
at 30 m) (䊉䉴 fig. 2). on the other hand,  xxxd2010xxx  (0.1–30 m)

media concentrations of cortisol and aldosterone were determined by enzyme immunoassay kits (diagnostic systems laboratories inc, tx, usa). the well washing was accomplished using
an elx50 automatic microplate washer (bio-tek instruments
inc, vt, usa). the absorbance of the solution was read using an
elx800 microplate reader (bio-tek instruments inc, vt, usa).

 xxxg1602xxx  transactivation assay
 xxxg1602xxx  transactivation activity was examined using human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 293t/17 (american type culture collection crl no. 1573), which were
maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum with antibiotics. the
mr/mmtv-luciferase receptor reporter system was composed
of pxm4-mr plasmid, which specifies the full-length human mr
with a c-terminal nanopeptide hemagglutinin epitope tag (provided by stefan andersson) [32, 33], and a mr responsive mouse
mammary tumor virus luciferase reporter vector (pmmtv-luc),
and a control -galactosidase plasmid (psv--galactosidase)
(promega, wi, usa). on day 0, 100 000 hek-293 cells/well were
plated onto 24-well dishes. on day 1, cells were transfected with
a mixture of plasmid dna (1 g/well) consisting of pxm4-mr
(180 ng), pmmtv-luc (720 ng), and psv--galactosidase (50 ng)
for 6 h using the transfection reagent transfast (promega, madison, wi, usa) according to the manufacturer’s directions. fortyeight hours after transfection, spironolactone or  xxxd2010xxx

expression plasmids for human mr and -galactosidase were transfected
into hek-293t/17 cells together with a mineralocorticoid responsive
mmtv-luciferase reporter plasmid. luciferase and -galactosidase
enzyme activities were measured in cell lysates after incubation with
aldosterone (1 nm) for 6 h. basal luciferase activity was 19 % of that seen
with aldosterone treatment. mean values are based on data from three
independent experiments.

adrenal cell aldosterone production [20–23]. it is also well documented that spironolactone binds and blocks cytochrome p450
enzymes involved in steroidogenesis [24–26].
 xxxd2010xxx  is the only clinically available agent in a new class of
selective mr blockers. its chemical structure diﬀers from
spironolactone by replacement of the 17 -thioacetyl group with
a carbomethoxy group.  xxxd2010xxx  is a competitive antagonist
of the mr that eﬀectively blocks aldosterone action [27]. like
spironolactone,  xxxd2010xxx  has been shown to be eﬀective in
antihypertensive therapy in controlling blood pressure similar
to inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) [14, 28],
angiotensin type i receptor ( xxxg100xxx ) [29], and calcium channels
[30]. while previous studies suggest that  xxxd2010xxx  has less
nontarget interaction with progesterone or  xxxg183xxx ,
the eﬀects of  xxxd2010xxx  on adrenal steroid production have not
been reported. in the current study, we compared the eﬀects of
spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  on steroidogenesis in the cultured human adrenal cell model, h295r cells [31]. consistent
with previous studies, spironolactone inhibited adrenal cell steroid production. in contrast,  xxxd2010xxx  had no eﬀect on adrenal
cell production of aldosterone or cortisol.

did not significantly aﬀect basal cortisol (200 nmol/24 h) or basal
aldosterone (0.6 nmol/24 h) production (䊉䉴 fig. 2).
to test the eﬀects of spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  on agoniststimulated adrenal cell steroidogenesis, h295r cells were treated
with ang ii or  xxxd1742xxx  for 24 h. ang ii (100 nm) treatment stimulated aldosterone production by 11-fold and cortisol production by 3-fold (䊉䉴 fig. 3). spironolactone (30 m) inhibited ang
ii-stimulated aldosterone production by 80 % and ang ii-stimulated cortisol production by 74 % (䊉䉴 fig. 3). treatment with for-

skolin (10 m) for 24 h stimulated cortisol production by 3-fold
and aldosterone production by 6-fold (䊉䉴 fig. 3). spironolactone
blocked the  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cortisol production by 70 %
(䊉䉴 fig. 3). on the other hand,  xxxd2010xxx  (30 m) had no influence on basal, ang ii, or  xxxd1742xxx  stimulated aldosterone or cortisol production (䊉䉴 fig. 3).
the rate-limiting step in adrenal steroid hormone production is
the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. bypassing the
rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis by supplying adrenal cells
with exogenous substrate (10 m pregnenolone) increased the
production of aldosterone (8.7-fold) (䊉䉴 fig. 4) and cortisol (2.6fold) (䊉䉴 fig. 4). spironolactone (30 m) inhibited pregnenolone
metabolism to both aldosterone (67 %) and cortisol (74 %) (䊉䉴 fig. 4).
 xxxd2010xxx  (30 m) did not inhibit pregnenolone-stimulated
cortisol or aldosterone production (䊉䉴 fig. 4).

discussion and conclusions
&
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) plays an integral role in cardiovascular homeostasis through its eﬀects on
vascular tone and plasma volume. activation of the raas is
associated with an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular
events, independent of eﬀects on blood pressure [34], whereas
interruption of the raas by ace and  xxxg100xxx  blockade reduces cardiovascular mortality [35, 36], and slows the progression of renal
disease [37, 38]. although ace inhibitors and ang ii receptor
antagonists suppress aldosterone production, plasma aldosterone levels often rise after chronic therapy in a phenomenon
called “aldosterone breakthrough” [39]. thus, many patients

with hypertension and congestive heart failure treated with
these agents remain unprotected from the eﬀects of inappropriate levels of circulating aldosterone.
the rales and ephesus studies have shown that this “aldosterone breakthrough” is an important factor because it is a determinant of outcome in heart failure patients. therefore, it may be
beneficial if the therapies employed were downstream of this
system and acted specifically at the mr. moreover, in some forms
of resistant hypertension, especially in cases of low-renin hypertension, such as in aldosterone-producing adenoma (conn’s syndrome) patients, the antihypertensive action of the mr
antagonists is unequalled. to normalize blood pressure in these
patients, high doses of spironolactone (up to 400 mg daily) are
sometimes required [40]. unfortunately, spironolactone lacks
specificity for the mr and possesses an aﬃnity for androgen and
progesterone receptors [41]. the rales trial reported a 10 %
incidence of gynecomastia and breast pain in its male subjects
(patients in this trial received 25–50 mg/day spironolactone)
[42]. this incidence was significantly higher than placebo (10 %
vs. 1 %) and caused significantly more patients to discontinue
treatment.  xxxd2010xxx  on the other hand, is more selective for
the mr. the critical feature of the  xxxd2010xxx  molecule conferring selectivity for the  xxxg1602xxx  is the presence of the 9,11-epoxy ring [43]. in vitro studies have shown
that this structural diﬀerence produces an approximate 10–20fold lower aﬃnity for the mr compared with spironolactone
[44, 45]. also, the epoxy ring significantly decreases  xxxd2010xxx ’s
binding aﬃnity [44]. as a result, the incidences of progesteroneand androgen-related adverse events are reported to be less frequent with  xxxd2010xxx .
as early as the 1970s, the inhibitory eﬀects of spironolactone on
the steroidogenic cytochrome p-450 enzymes were reported in
several models, including steroidogenic tissues from bovine,
guinea pig, and human [46–49]. this eﬀect mainly resulted from
the covalent binding of 7 -thiospironolactone, a metabolite of
spironolactone, to microsomal proteins, including cytochrome
p-450 enzymes, with subsequent inhibition and/or degradation
[50–52]. using concentrations of spironolactone similar to those
studied previously, we showed that spironolactone (10 m) suppressed steroid production in the human adrenal cortical h295r
cell line. in addition, our experiments indicate that spironolactone decreases the ability of ang ii and  xxxd1742xxx  to stimulate
cortisol and aldosterone production. the inhibitory eﬀects of
spironolactone on aldosterone production have been observed
in a variety of in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal model systems [21–23, 53]. these observations can be explained by previous studies that described the ability of spironolactone to bind
and inhibit steroidogenic cytochrome p-450 enzymes (including
18-, 17 - and 21-hydroxylase activities) [24, 50, 54]. there are
no studies that suggest that spironolactone inhibition of steroidogenesis is due its eﬀects on mr. as noted above, the concentrations needed to eﬀectively inhibit steroid production (10 and
30 m spironolactone) were far greater than the amounts needed
to inhibit mr activation. this indicates that the inhibition of
steroid production by spironolactone is likely due to a nongenomic action, which is related to direct inhibitory actions on
the enzymes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis. currently, it is less clear if treatment with high doses of spironolactone inhibit production of human adrenal steroid in vivo.
however, treatment of men with 400 mg doses of spironolactone
has been shown to cause a significant rise in plasma progesterone and 17- xxxd2303xxx  levels, suggesting an eﬀect on

adrenal 21-hydroxylase activity leading to the release of precursor steroids [55].
interestingly, similar concentrations of  xxxd2010xxx  did not
inhibit steroidogenesis in the adrenal cells. pharmacokinetic
studies suggest that when  xxxd2010xxx  is administrated at a dose
of 100 mg per person, it is well absorbed, with a mean cmax of
1.72 g/ml; this is achieved in 1.2 h postdosing [56]. thus, the
concentrations used in the current study (30 m) are well above
the levels seen in vivo, suggesting that this compound is unlikely
to inhibit adrenal steroid production in vivo. it is interesting that
the spironolactone oﬀ-target inhibition of steroid production
(particularly that of aldosterone) has been suggested to be part
of the beneficial eﬀect in mineralocorticoid blockade. further
studies will be needed to determine if the lack of  xxxd2010xxx 
inhibition of adrenal steroid production aﬀects its overall eﬃcacy as an antimineralocorticoid.
primary aldosteronism is currently considered to represent 8 %
of the hypertensive population. treatment of this group of
patients with mr blockade is increasing, and there are currently
two main mr blockers: spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx . previous
studies have shown that spironolactone and its metabolites are
more potent inhibitors of mr than  xxxd2010xxx . however, higher
doses of spironolactone have several nonspecific actions, including its eﬀects on androgen receptors, progesterone receptors,
and steroid hormone production. herein, we have demonstrated
that  xxxd2010xxx , unlike spironolactone, does not inhibit adrenal
steroid production.
