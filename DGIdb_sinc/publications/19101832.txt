final amended report on the safety assessment of
methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben,
isopropylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben,
and benzylparaben as used in cosmetic products1

did affect sperm counts at all levels from 0.01% to 1.0%. epididymis and seminal vesicle weight decreases were reported in rats
given a 1% oral butylparaben dose; and decreased sperm number
and motile activity in f1 offspring of rats maternally exposed to
100 mg/kg day−1 were reported. decreased sperm numbers and
activity were reported in f1 offspring of female rats given butylparaben (in dmso) by subcutaneous injection at 100 or 200 mg/kg
day−1 , but there were no abnormalities in the reproductive organs.
methylparaben was studied using rats at levels in the diet up to
an estimated mean dose of 1141.1 mg/kg day−1 with no adverse
testicular effects. butylparaben was studied using rats at levels in
the diet up to an estimated mean dose of 1087.6 mg/kg day−1 in
a repeat of the study noted above, but using a larger number of
animals and a staging analysis of testicular effects—no adverse reproductive effects were found. butylparaben does bind to estrogen
receptors in isolated rat uteri, but with an affinity orders of magnitude less than natural estradiol. relative binding ( xxxd1880xxx  binding affinity set at 100) to the human estrogen receptors alpha
and beta increases as a function of chain length from not detectable for
methylparaben to 0.267 ± 0.027 for human  xxxg730xxx  alpha and
0.340 ± 0.031 for human  xxxg730xxx  beta for isobutylparaben.
in a study of  xxxg183xxx  binding, propylparaben exhibited weak competitive binding, but methylparaben had no binding
effect at all. phba at 5 mg/kg day−1 subcutaneously (s.c.) was reported to produce an estrogenic response in one uterotrophic assay
using mice, but there was no response in another study using rats
(s.c. up to 5 mg/kg day−1 ) and mice (s.c. up to 100 mg/kg day−1 ) and
in a study using rats (s.c. up to 100 mg/kg day−1 ). methylparaben
failed to produce any effect in uterotrophic assays in two laboratories, but did produce an effect in other studies from another
laboratory. the potency of methylparaben was at least 1000× less
when compared to natural estradiol. the same pattern was reported for ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben when
potency was compared to natural estradiol. in two studies, isobutylparaben did produce an estrogenic response in the uterotrophic
assay, but the potency was at least 240,000× less than estradiol.
in one study, benzylparaben produced an estrogenic response in
the uterotrophic assay, but the potency was at least 330,000× less
than estradiol. estrogenic activity of parabens and phba was increased in human breast cancer cells in vitro, but the increases were
around 4 orders of magnitude less than that produced by estradiol.
parabens are practically nonirritating and nonsensitizing in the
population with normal skin. paraben sensitization has occurred
and continues to be reported in the case literature, but principally
when exposure involves damaged or broken skin. even when patients with chronic dermatitis are patch-tested to a parabens mix,

parabens is the name given to a group of p-hydroxybenzoic
acid (phba) esters used in over 22,000 cosmetics as preservatives at concentrations up to 0.8% (mixtures of parabens) or up
to 0.4% (single paraben). the group includes methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, isopropylparaben, butylparaben,
isobutylparaben, and benzylparaben. industry estimates of the
daily use of cosmetic products that may contain parabens were
17.76 g for adults and 378 mg for infants. parabens in cosmetic
formulations applied to skin penetrate the stratum corneum in
inverse relation to the ester chain length. carboxylesterases hydrolyze parabens in the skin. parabens do not accumulate in the
body. serum concentrations of parabens, even after intravenous administration, quickly decline and remain low. acute toxicity studies
in animals indicate that parabens are not significantly toxic by various routes of administration. subchronic and chronic oral studies
indicate that parabens are practically nontoxic. numerous genotoxicity studies, including ames testing, dominant lethal assay, hostmediated assay, and cytogenic assays, indicate that the parabens
are generally nonmutagenic, although ethylparaben and methylparaben did increase chromosomal aberrations in a chinese hamster ovary cell assay. ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben in the diet produced cell proliferation in the forestomach
of rats, with the activity directly related to chain length of the alkyl
chain, but isobutylparaben and butylparaben were noncarcinogenic in a mouse chronic feeding study. methylparaben was noncarcinogenic when injected subcutaneously in mice or rats, or when administered intravaginally in rats, and was not cocarcinogenic when
injected subcutaneously in mice. propylparaben was noncarcinogenic in a study of transplacental carcinogenesis. methylparaben
was nonteratogenic in rabbits, rats, mice, and hamsters, and ethylparaben was nonteratogenic in rats. parabens, even at levels that
produce maternal toxicity, do not produce fetal anomalies in animal
studies. parabens have been extensively studied to evaluate male reproductive toxicity. in one in vitro study, sperm were not viabile at
concentrations as low as 6 mg/ml methylparaben, 8 mg/ml ethylparaben, 3 mg/ml propylparaben, or 1 mg/ml butylparaben, but an
in vivo study of 0.1% or 1.0% methylparaben or ethylparaben in
the diet of mice reported no spermatotoxic effects. propylparaben

cosmetic ingredient review

parabens generally induce sensitization in less than 4% of such
individuals. many patients sensitized to paraben-containing medications can wear cosmetics containing these ingredients with no
adverse effects. clinical patch testing data available over the past
20 years demonstrate no significant change in the overall portion of
dermatitis patients that test positive for parabens. as reviewed by
the cosmetic ingredient review (cir) expert panel, the available
acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity tests, using a range of exposure routes, demonstrate a low order of parabens’ toxicity at concentrations that would be used in cosmetics. parabens are rarely
irritating or sensitizing to normal human skin at concentrations
used in cosmetics. although parabens do penetrate the stratum
corneum, metabolism of parabens takes place within viable skin,
which is likely to result in only 1% unmetabolized parabens available for absorption into the body. the expert panel did consider
data in the category of endocrine disruption, including male reproductive toxicity and various estrogenic activity studies. the cir
expert panel compared exposures to parabens resulting from use of
cosmetic products to a no observed adverse effect level (noael) of
1000 mg/kg day−1 based on the most statistically powerful and wellconducted study of the effects of butylparabens on the male reproductive system. the cir expert panel considered exposures to cosmetic products containing a single parabens preservative (use level
of 0.4%) separately from products containing multiple parabens
(use level of 0.8%) and infant exposures separately from adult exposures in determining margins of safety (mos). the mos for
infants ranged from ∼6000 for single paraben products to ∼3000
for multiple paraben products. the mos for adults ranged from
1690 for single paraben products to 840 for multiple paraben products. the expert panel considers that these mos determinations
are conservative and likely represent an overestimate of the possibility of an adverse effect (e.g., use concentrations may be lower,
penetration may be less) and support the safety of cosmetic products in which parabens preservatives are used.

introduction
a safety assessment of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben was published in 1984 with the conclusion that these ingredients are safe as cosmetic ingredients in
the present practices of use (elder 1984). in 1986, it was reported
that the available data were insufficient to support the safety
of benzylparaben as used in cosmetic products (elder 1986).
a safety assessment of isobutylparaben and isopropylparaben
was reported in 1995 (andersen 1995) with the conclusion that
these ingredients are safe as cosmetic ingredients in the present
practices of use. the generic term “parabens” will be used
to encompass benzylparaben, butylparaben, ethylparaben,
isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, methylparaben, and
propylparaben.
new studies since 1984 have been reported on the use of
parabens in cosmetics; parabens’ skin penetration, cytotoxicity, vasodilation effects, and carcinogenesis; and clinical testing
of parabens—all areas considered in the original safety assessments. not addressed in the original safety assessments were
new studies reporting a link between parabens and endocrine
disruption. these data were sufficient to reopen consideration
of the safety of these ingredients in cosmetics and prepare this
amended safety assessment.

because the available data suggest that biological effects of
parabens are related to the alkyl chain length, the order of ingredients in the report title and the presentation within each section has been organized from the shortest to the longest/largest;
i.e., methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, isopropylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, and benzylparaben.
in addition, a safety assessment of benzyl alcohol,  xxxd306xxx , and sodium benzoate has been completed (andersen
2001). these data may be relevant because benzyl alcohol and
 xxxd306xxx  are metabolites of benzylparaben. a summary of
that safety assessment is provided.
chemistry
structure and terminology
according to the international cosmetic ingredient dictionary and handbook published by the cosmetic, toiletry,
and fragrance association (ctfa), parabens are esters of phydroxybenzoic acid (phba) with various alcohols and conform to the structure shown in figure 1 (gottschalck and
mcewen 2004).
benzylparaben is the ester of benzyl alcohol and phydroxybenzoic acid and conforms to the structure shown in
figure 2 (gottschalck and mcewen 2004).
other technical names and cas numbers for each of the
parabens are given in table 1.
parabens are provided to the cosmetics industry under the
trade names listed in table 2. parabens are included in trade
name mixtures supplied to the cosmetics industry as shown in
table 3.
physical and chemical properties
parabens form small colorless crystals or white crystalline
powders with practically no odor or taste. parabens are soluble in alcohol, ether, glycerine, and  xxxd3034xxx  and
slightly soluble or almost insoluble in water. as the alkyl chain
length increases, water solubility decreases. parabens are hygroscopic and have a high oil/water partition coefficient (neidig
and burrell 1944; shiralkar et al. 1978; lide 1993; nikitakis and
mcewen 1990).
table 4 summarizes other physical and chemical properties
of parabens.
manufacturing process
parabens are prepared by esterifying phba with the corresponding alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as  xxxd3258xxx , and an excess of the specific alcohol. the acid is then
neutralized with caustic soda, and the product is crystallized by
cooling, centrifuged, washed, dried under vacuum, milled, and
blended (informatics 1972). benzylparaben can also be prepared
by reacting benzyl chloride with sodium p-hydrobenzoic acid
(schneider 1957).

butylparaben, and isobutyl (c4 h9 ) for isobutylparaben.

analytical methods
chromatography, especially high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc), is used presently for determinations of
parabens in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. parabens
may be determined directly, or they may be chemically modified and the derivative subsequently identified.
table 5 lists analytical methods for paraben determination.
grom chromatography gmbh (2004) provides a hplc separation column specific to the analysis of preservatives. the
eluent is 0.05 m nah5 po4 at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 14
mpa and 21◦ c. detection is made at 235 nm. figure 3 shows the
obtainable separation of parabens.
reactivity/stability
parabens are stable in air and are resistant to hydrolysis in hot
and cold water, as well as in acidic solutions, although the cosmetic, toiletry, and fragrance association (1981) did state that
benzylparaben is subject to acid hydrolysis. resistance to hydrolysis increases as the size of alkyl sidechain increases. the
rate of hydrolysis is ph-dependent. above ph 7, appreciable
hydrolysis occurs, producing phba and the corresponding alcohol. in strongly alkaline solutions, parabens hydrolyze to the
corresponding carboxylic acid, which then becomes ionized.

parabens are resistant to hydrolysis under usual conditons of
sterilization (autoclaving) and also resist saponification (aalto
et al. 1953; benmaman and sorby 1965; raval and parrott 1967;
chichester and tanner 1968; mcdavid 1974).
interaction with other cosmetic ingredients
bolle and mirimanoff (1950) reported that 2% tween 81,
tween 60, and arlacel 83 interfered with the preservative properties of 0.1% methylparaben (tween is a trade name for a nonionic surfactant and emulsifier, and arlacel is a trade name for an
emulsifier). de navarre (1956) observed that 1% tween (2, 4, 6,
or 8) improved the preservative effect of 0.1% methylparaben,
whereas 2% tween inhibited the effect of 0.2% methylparaben.
at 2%, an oleyl alcohol ethylene oxide adduct (emulphor ow870) also interfered with 0.2% paraben. ishizaki et al. (1978)
reported that 0.7% tween 80 inactivated butylparaben.
according to de navarre (1957), most nonionic surfactants that are based on the addition of ethylene or propylene
oxide to  xxxd2154xxx , alcohols, esters, or polyglycols interfere
with the preservative properties of the parabens. the interference appears to be due to the formation of complexes through
hydrogen bonding. the addition of anionics or quaternary
compounds to products may prevent paraben inactivation by
nonionics.
the interaction of fatty acid esters of sucrose and parabens
was studied by valdez et al. (1968). the authors suggested that
the paraben molecules may become incorporated within surfactant micelles and associate, through a combination of hydrogen
and hydrophobic bonding, to form a stable paraben-sucrose ester complex. the formation of such a complex would result in a
loss of paraben preservative activity. hydrophobic bonding was
indicated when it was observed that methylparaben complexed
to a greater degree than propylparaben.
according to rosen and berke (1973), if a 5% nonionic surfactant is added to paraben-containing water-oil emulsion, as
much as 75% of the total preservative will migrate to the nonionic surfactant micelle, leaving only 25% to distribute between
the oil and water phases of the emulsion.
goto and endo (1979) studied the hydrogen bonding of the
parabens to  xxxd3215xxx  (sls) micelles. these authors
suggested that the sulfuric group of sls hydrogen bonds with
the hydroxyl group of the paraben, resulting in short penetration
of the paraben molecule into the palisade layer of the micelle.
rosen and berke (1973) reported that parabens are bound by
various macromolecules (such as  xxxd2609xxx  and gelatin),
nonionic emulsifiers (especially those containing polyethylene
glycol [peg] groups), and proteins.
diffusion from formulations
esposito et al. (2003) examined the diffusion of methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben from a water-in-oil
emulsion, and oil-in-water emulsion, and two hydrophillic gels,
described as typical topical formulation bases. for the water/oil
emulsion, the parabens were dissolved in boiling water and

for both the water/oil and the oil/water emulsions, diffusion
of parabens into the receptor fluid was directly proportional to
the solubility of the paraben in water. for the two gels, the reverse
was true. table 6 presents the normalized fluxes for each paraben
from each formulation.
the authors suggested that the differences between the results
for water/oil versus oil/water could be explained by the solubility of methylparaben in the water phase and the partitioning of
ethylparaben and propylparaben to the internal disperse phase
of the oil/water emulsion or the continuous oil phase of the water/oil emulsion. the data on diffusion from the gels suggested
to the authors that the lipophilic components of the gel matrix
could be a means to hold parabens in a formulation (esposito
et al. 2003).

use
cosmetic
parabens function as preservatives in cosmetics (gottschalck
and mcewen 2004). according to the cosmetic, toiletry, and
fragrance association (ctfa), formulations may contain mixtures of parabens (up to 0.8%) or may contain a single paraben
(up to 0.4%), and industry estimates of the daily use of cosmetic
products that may contain parabens were 17.76 g for adults and
378 mg for infants (ctfa 2005).
methylparaben
industry has reported to the food and drug administration
(fda) that methylparaben was used in 8786 products across a
wide range of product categories (fda 2006).
table 7 presents the available information on frequency
of use and concentration of use of methylparaben. fda has
also provided the number of products in each category so that
the reader may determine what portion of reported products

contain methylparaben (fda 2006). for example, methylparaben is used in 4 of the 38 baby shampoos reported to fda.
in 1981, industry provided information on broad concentration ranges in each product category and most such uses were in
the >0.1% to 1% range, although one product was reported in the
10% to 25% range (elder 1984). an industry survey conducted
by the ctfa found that the concentration of use of methylparaben ranged from 0.0003% to 1% (ctfa 2003).
ethylparaben
industry reported to the food and drug administration (fda)
that ethylparaben was used in 2679 products across a wide
range of product categories (fda 2002), compared to 139 in
1981 (elder 1984). broad concentration ranges reported in each
product category in 1981 were ≤0.1% and >0.1% to 1% (elder 1984). an industry survey conducted by ctfa in 2003
found that the concentration of use of ethylparaben ranged from
0.0002% to 0.98% (ctfa 2003).
table 8 presents the available information on frequency of
use and concentration of use of ethylparaben.
propylparaben
industry reported to the food and drug administration (fda)
that propylparaben was used in 7118 products across a wide
range of product categories (fda 2006). this is a decrease
over the 5868 products with propylparaben reported to fda
in 1981 (elder 1984). in the concentration of use data reported
to fda in 1981, industry provided information on broad concentration ranges at which the ingredient was used in each
product category—such uses were primarily in the ≤0.1% and
the >0.1% to 1% ranges, but one product was reported in the
>10% to 25% range (elder 1984). an industry survey conducted

in 1981, face and neck skin care preparations and body and hand skin care preparations were combined in one category.

by the ctfa in 2003 found that the current concentration of use
of propylparaben ranged from 0.00002% to 0.7% (ctfa 2003).
table 9 presents the available information on frequency of
use and concentration of use of propylparaben.
isopropylparaben
industry reported to the fda that isopropylparaben was used
in 48 products across a wide range of product categories (fda
2006). only one use had been reported in 1993 (andersen 1995).
a survey conducted by ctfa found that the current concentration of use of isopropylparaben ranged from 0.00001% to 0.3%
(ctfa 2004a).
table 10 gives the available use data for isopropylparaben.

butylparaben
industry reported to the fda that butylparaben was used in
3001 products across a wide range of product categories (fda
2002). this is an increase over the 704 products with butylparaben reported to fda in 1981 (elder 1984). in the concentration of use data reported to fda in 1981, industry provided
information on broad concentration ranges at which the ingredient was used in each product category—such uses were primarily in the ≤0.1% range (elder 1984). an industry survey
conducted by ctfa in 2003 found that the current concentration
of use of butylparaben ranged from 0.00004% to 0.54% (ctfa
2003).
table 11 presents the available use data for butylparaben.

in 1981, face and neck skin care preparations and body and hand skin care preparations were combined in one category.
this category no longer exists.

isobutylparaben
industry reported to the fda that isobutylparaben was used
in 642 products across a wide range of product categories (fda
2006). this is an increase over the 86 products with isobutylparaben reported to fda in 1993 (andersen 1995). no use concentration data were reported by andersen (1995). a survey
conducted by ctfa determined the current concentration of use

of isobutylparaben was between 0.000007% and 0.5%(ctfa
2004a).
table 12 gives the available use data for isobutylparaben.
benzylparaben
industry reported to the fda that benzylparaben was used in
three underarm deodorants (fda 2006). this is a decrease from

the 45 uses reported in 1984 (elder 1986). in 1984, industry
reported broad concentration ranges in each product category—
such uses were primarily in the ≤0.1% range, although one
underarm deodorant was in the 0.1% to 1% range (elder 1986).
an industry survey conducted by the ctfa found no reported
uses/use concentrations of benzylparaben (ctfa 2004a).
table 13 presents the available use data for benzylparaben.

ucts contained 0.01% to 0.59% total parabens. the authors noted
that the one product at 0.87% does not comply with the danish
and european commission maximum concentration limit on
total parabens of 0.8%, calculated as p-hydroxybenzoic acid.
the limit for any one paraben is 0.4%, and none of the products exceeded that value for a single paraben (rastogi et al.
1995).

product analysis
according to neidig and burrell (1944), parabens formulate
well because they have no perceptible odor or taste, are practically neutral in ph, do not produce discoloration, and do not
cause hardening or muddying.
rastogi et al. (1995) analyzed cosmetic products for the presence of methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, and benzylparaben.
identification was based on hplc retention times relative to
the retention time of isopropylparaben at a detection limit of
0.005%. of the 57 rinse-off products analyzed, 77% contained
parabens; and 99% of the 158 leave-on products contained
parabens.
table 14 presents the concentration (weight/weight) of each
of the measured parabens in cosmetic products and the prevalence of each. with the exception of one suntan lotion at 0.87%,
rinse-off products contained 0.01% to 0.5% and leave-on prod-

baby products
parabens are often used in combination in cosmetic products. data provided in an industry survey (ctfa 2004b) found
that methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben are used to a total concentration of 0.3% in baby lotions,
oils, powders, and creams. likewise, methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben are used in this product category to a
total concentration of 0.3%. methylparaben and propylparaben
are used in this category to a total concentration of 0.5%.
this same survey (ctfa 2004b) found that methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and isobutylparaben are used to a total concentration of 0.08% in the other
baby products category (cologne). likewise, methylparaben,
propylparaben, and butylparaben are used in the other baby
products category (cleansing cloths) to a total concentration of
0.33% to 0.53%. methylparaben and propylparaben are used

in 1981, face and neck skin care preparations and body and hand skin care preparations were combined in one category.
this category no longer exists.

in the other baby products category (cleansing cloths) to a total concentration of 0.45%. methylparaben was used alone at a
total concentration of 0.05% in the other baby products category
(cologne).
noncosmetic
food
the fda has approved the use of parabens in foods as given
in the specific code of federal regulations (cfr) citations that
follow. methylparaben (21 cfr 184.1490) and propylparaben
(21 cfr 184.1670) are generally recognized as safe (gras)

when used as chemical preservatives in foods, with use limits
of 0.1% for each. methylparaben and propylparaben (indirect
food additives) are permitted by prior sanction as antimycotics
in food-packaging materials with no limits or restrictions (21
cfr 181.23), and ethylparaben is similarly allowed as a component of adhesives intended for use in packaging, transporting,
or holding food (21 cfr 175.105). methylparaben and propylparaben are specifically cited as preservatives, not to exceed
0.1%, acceptable for use in fruit jelly (21 cfr 150.141) and
fruit preserves and jams (21 cfr 150.161). the fda has established a tolerance of zero for residues of methylparaben in milk
from dairy animals (21 cfr 556.390).
the joint who/fao expert committee on food additives
(jecfa) updated its specification for methylparaben in 1998
and reiterated its 1973 finding that the group acceptible daily
intake (adi) for ethyl, methyl, and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic
acid in foods is 0 to 10 mg/kg day−1 (jecfa 1998).
the european food safety authority (efsa) scientific panel
on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials
in contact with food adopted an opinion on the safety of paraben
usage in food (efsa 2004), which stated that the adi of 0 to 10
mg/kg day−1 for the sum of methylparaben and ethylparaben is
still valid. the opinion also stated, however, that propylparaben
should not be included in the adi.

cosmetic ingredient review

pharmaceuticals
sabalitschka (1930) reported that parabens were first used in
drug products in 1924. boehm and maddox (1972) stated that
combinations of parabens are more active than individual esters.
as preservatives, parabens are or have been used in suppositories, anesthetics, eyewashes, pills, syrups, weight-gaining solutions, injectable solutions, and contraceptives. use concentrations vary from product to product, but maximum levels seldom
exceed 1% (neidig and burrell 1944; hassler 1954; zacharias
and fisgus 1971; boehm and maddox 1972; kassem et al. 1976).
fda does not include preservatives in its over-the-counter
(otc) drug monographs. preservatives are considered inactive
ingredients and must meet the requirements specified in 21 cfr
§330.1(e) that they be suitable ingredients that are safe and do
not interfere with effectiveness.
fda currently lists inactive ingredients used in approved
drug products on-line (fda 2004). table 15 gives these data
for parabens. according to fda, this information can be used
by industry as an aid in developing drug products. for example,
if an inactive ingredient has been approved in a certain dosage
form at a certain potency, a sponsor could consider it safe for
use in a similar manner for a similar type of product.
in addition, fda has specified 0.05% propylparaben for
standard preparation a and 0.10% methylparaben for standard
preparation b, the homosalate sunscreens used in spf testing
(21 cfr 352.70).
in 21 cfr 310.545(a)(22)(ii), fda stated that the safety and
effectiveness of methylparaben as a topical antifungal for treating diaper rash is not demonstrated.
other
neidig and burrell (1944) stated that parabens were historically used in textiles as antifungal agents, in gelatins and photographic emulsions, in bone glues, and in malt as antifermentation
agents.
fda listed methylparaben and propylparaben as components
in its description of betamethasone acetate used as an animal
drug (21 cfr 522.161).
general biology
absorption, metabolism, and excretion
absorption
whitworth and jun (1973) studied the influence of surfactants on parabens absorption using frogs. each of five frogs
(rana pipiens; 30 to 35 g) were immersed in 500 ml solutions
of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben (concentration not given) for 2 h. the immersion liquid
was sampled at 20-min intervals, assayed for parabens concentration, and returned to the beaker after analysis, over a 2-h
period. presence of parabens in frog skin was not determined,
only the residual paraben concentration in the immersion fluid
was measured.

concentration of paraben in the immersion fluid decreased
via linear kinetics as a function of time, with the greatest decrease
(presumably the greatest uptake) reported for butylparaben. the
presumed uptake increased as the length of the ester carbon chain
length increased.
when the experiment was repeated with polysorbate 20 at
0.5% or 1.0% added to the immersion fluid, the pattern of
presumed uptake reversed. in this case, the greatest decrease
(again, presumably the greatest uptake) was reported for methylparaben. the presumed uptake decreased as the length of the ester carbon chain length increased in the presence of polysorbate
20.
when the experiment was repeated with sodium  xxxd1685xxx  (5 ×
10−5 m) added to the immersion fluid, the pattern of presumed
uptake was similar to parabens alone.
the authors suggested that these results confirm previous
findings that the greater the lipid solubility of a chemical, the
greater the rate of absorption in the frog (whitworth and jun
1973).
fischmeister et al. (1975) applied parabens in an ointment
vehicle (15% in vaseline) to the skin of each of three healthy
humans. presence of residual parabens on the skin was determined at 1 and 8 h. one hour after application, parabens were
identified; at 8 h, they were not detected.
komatsu and suzuki (1979) studied the percutaneous absorption of butylparaben (0.015% to 0.1% aqueous) through
guinea pig skin in vitro. the authors had previously shown that
butylparaben was absorbed percutaneously from several ointments through mouse skin. the presence of a solubilizer (such
as polysorbate 80,  xxxd3034xxx , or peg-400) increased
antimicrobial activity and reduced percutaneous absorption of
butylparaben. total penetration of butylparaben from an aqueous vehicle was a combination of the penetration through the
epidermis and the penetration through the adnexal structures.
over time, transient penetration through the latter became less
important than the steady-state penetration through unbroken
skin.
hansen and möllgaard (1990) reported that the permeability
coefficient varied as a function of chain length for parabens
using full thickness human skin in the following manner: methyl
> ethyl > propyl > butyl > benzyl. no further details were
provided.
dal pozzo and pastori (1996) determined the percutaneous
absorption through abdominal cadaver skin of a series of
parabens from water, water with 50%  xxxd3034xxx , water
with 20% peg-400,  xxxd2648xxx  and three types of cosmetic
formulation bases.
type i formulation (oil/water) base consisted of 6.5 g
squalane, 0.5 g stearic  xxxd2348xxx  g octyl palmitate, 3 g isopropyl  xxxd2681xxx , 2 g karitè butter, 0.35 g carbopol, 0.35 g triethanolamine, 4 g glyceryl stearate/peg-100 stearate, 0.5 g sorbitan stearate, 3 g dimethicone, 3.2 g cyclomethicone, 0.7 g
p-hydroxyalkyl benzoate, 0.02 g butylhydroxy anisol, 0.2 g allantoin, and 69.98 g water.

formulation bases were applied to the stratum corneum surface
to a thickness of 1 cm. appearance of parabens in the receptor
fluid was determined by reverse phase hplc at intervals from
1 to 8 h.
table 16 presents the results of the maximum flux as a function of the vehicle for water, water with 50%  xxxd3034xxx ,
water with 20% peg-400, and  xxxd2648xxx , and as a function
of the paraben side chain. based on the maximum flux and the
saturation concentration for each paraben in these vehicles, the
authors further determined permeability constants and compared
the log of the permeability constant with the log p of the various
parabens. for each of the water-based vehicles, the permeability
constant increased as a function of the log p of the paraben. the
permeability constant decreased as a function of the addition
of increasing proportion of glycols. for the lipophilic paraben
vehicle (paraffin), the permeability constants actually decreased
with increasing log p. the authors stated, however, that these
simple models do not explain the behavior in complex cosmetic
formulations.
as shown in the second part of table 16, for the three
cosmetic-type formulations, parabens fluxes decreased as a
function of the paraben side chain. using cosmetic-type formulations at 30 days post preparation, methy > ethyl > propyl
> butyl > hexyl. as a function of time after preparation, the parbens fluxes also decreased, but maintained the same rank order
of penetration. a steady-state flux was reached after 100 days
and did not appreciably decrease further up to 200 days (last
determination). the steady-state fluxes decreased as a function
of the log p of the paraben used.
the authors concluded that the concentration of parabens
in the aqueous phase of a cosmetic formulation (necessary
for preservative effectiveness) can be increased by preferentially using higher-chain-length parabens. at the same time,

25

they suggested that percutaneous absorption can be decreased
by the same approach, coupled with the addition of solubilizers, such as glycols, to the formulation (dal passo and pastori
1996).
ishiwatari et al. (2005) conducted a study using human
volunteers in which the levels of methylparaben in the stratum corneum were measured. cosmetic emulsions containing
0.15%, 0.25%, and 0.5% (w/v) methylparaben were applied one
time to the forearm (42 cm2 ) of one male and one female subject.
at 1, 2, 5, and 12 h after application, a small area was cleaned
of emulsion using wet cotton and methylparaben was extracted
by application of a glass cylinder (3.1 cm2 ) with 0.5 ml ethanol
for 5 min. methylparaben concentrations were determined in the
ethanol solvent using hplc (for the 1-, 2-, and 5-h durations)
and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (gc/ms) for other
treatments.
healthy japanese adults (1 male, 11 female) applied a lotion
only (6 subjects) or a lotion and an emulsion (6 subjects) containing methylparaben (concentration not stated) twice a day
for 1 month. concentrations of methylparaben in the stratum
corneum were determined as above using (gc/ms) before the
first application, at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, and 2 days after stopping.
for the single application, methylparaben reached its peak
1 to 2 h after application (peak was slightly higher for each
higher use concentration) and returned to baseline after 12
h. repeated applications resulted in an increase in methylparaben concentration in the stratum corneum over time for
both the lotion application and the lotion plus emulsion application. after 2 days, methylparaben had returned to pretreatment
levels.
these authors also determined the penetration of methylparaben through yucatan micropig skin with the fatty layers
removed and the skin mounted in diffusion cells. an aqueous
solution (10 µl) of methylparaben (1%) was placed on each
skin sample. at 15, 60, and 120 min, skin samples were removed
from the diffusion cell and wiped. the stratum corneum was tape
stripped 5× and the tape strips were extracted with methanolwater (50:50). the dermis was separated from the epidermis by
heat treatment and each layer was weighed, homogenized, and
extracted with methanol-water. methylparaben in the methanolwater extracts was determined using hplc. methylparaben in
the stratum corneum increased with time; increased in the epidermis from 15 to 60 min (no time 0 measurement), then decreased
from 60 to 120 min; and increased in the dermis slightly from
15 to 60 min and remained essentially the same from 60 to 120
min (ishiwatari et al. 2005).
effects of penetration enhancers on absorption. kitagawa
et al. (1997) measured the effect of penetration enhancers on
the skin penetration of parabens using excised guinea pig skin
mounted in a two-chamber diffusion cell. penetration enhancers
used were 15% ethanol, 15% ethanol plus 1%  xxxd2565xxx , and a
0.025% suspension of n -dodecyl-2-pyrrolidone (ndp), which
were added to the donor chamber with either methyl-, ethyl-,
propyl-, or butylparaben.

in the absence of penetration enhancers, there was a direct relationship between the permeability coefficient for each paraben
(k p ) and its octanol/water partition coefficient (log p) as shown
in table 17.
to confirm that penetration through the stratum corneum
lipid layer was the rate limiting step, skin incubated with a
chloroform-methanol mixture for 12 h was used. the permeability coefficient of each paraben was around 90 ×10−3 cm
h−1 , eliminating the relationship with log p.
addition of ndp stimulated the skin permeability of methylparaben by a factor of 7 and ethylparaben by a small amount, but
had no effect on permeability of either propyl- or butylparaben.
the mixture of 15% ethanol and 1%  xxxd2565xxx  increased the
skin permeability of methylparaben by a factor of 16, had no
effect on ethyl- or propylparaben, and decreased the skin permeability of butylparaben by a factor of 5. the same pattern,
but to a lesser degree, was seen with 15% ethanol alone.
the authors concluded that the effect of ndp resulted partly
as a result of ndp disruption of the stratum corneum lipid layer.
they speculated that the decrease in butylparaben with 15%
ethanol and 15% ethanol plus 1%  xxxd2565xxx  related to a reduction in partitioning of butylparaben between skin and vehicle
because of an increase in solubility in the donor solution in the
presence of alcohol (kitagawa et al. 1997).
effects of occlusion and vehicle on absorption
cross and roberts (2000) examined the effect of occlusion
on parabens skin penetration as a function of vehicle. human female abdominal skin was used to prepare epidermal membranes,
which were mounted in franz-type diffusion cells. methyl-,
ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben in a particular vehicle were
added to the donor chamber and spread over the skin surface. the
vehicles used were a commercial allergy test ointment, acetone,
and ethanol. occlusion was done using a piece of high-density
polyurethane. paraben concentration in the receptor fluid was determined by hplc after 10 h. occlusion resulted in a decrease
in penetration of each paraben in ointment, but increased penetration of each paraben in acetone or ethanol. table 18 shows
the effects of vehicle and occlusion on each paraben.

in a study by sabalitschka and neufeld-crzellitzer (1954), 2
g of benzylparaben were consumed daily by each of two human
volunteers for 5 days. their urine was analyzed for metabolic

products. approximately 6% of the administered compound was
eliminated unchanged, and approximately 87% was eliminated
as the sulfate conjugate of the ester. small quantities of the ester were also hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and benzyl
alcohol, the latter being oxidized to  xxxd306xxx . the latter two
were excreted either unchanged or as their glycine conjugates,
p-hydroxyhippuric acid and hippuric acid. the investigators reported these percentages as approximations due to the isolation
and analytical procedures used in the study.
jones et al. (1956) studied the metabolism of parabens in
dogs, rabbits, and in one human volunteer. intravenous injections at 50 mg/kg methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben,
or butylparaben were administered to groups of three or more
fasted dogs. similarly, these compounds were administered
orally at a dose of 1.0 g/kg. blood and urine were analyzed
at predetermined intervals.
immediately following intravenous injection, very little ester
remained in the blood. metabolites were detectable in the blood
up to 6 h post injection and 24 h post ingestion. recovery of all
esters but butylparaben ranged from 58% to 94% of the administered dose. absorption was essentially complete. recovery of
butylparaben after oral administration was 40% and 48% after
i.v. administration. the authors considered this finding a result
of less effective hydrolysis of butylparaben.
dogs given 50 mg/kg were then killed and the distribution of
esters and metabolites to organs was determined. pure ester was
recovered only in the brain, spleen, and pancreas. high concentrations of metabolites were detected in the liver and kidneys.

parabens

with in vitro assays, it was found that esterases in the liver
and kidneys of the dog were extremely efficient in hydrolyzing parabens—complete hydrolysis after 3 min for all parabens
except butylparaben, which took 30 to 60 min.
no accumulation of parabens was observed in the tissues of
dogs given orally 1 g/kg/day methylparaben or propylparaben
for 1 year. the rate of urinary excretion of esters and metabolites
in these dogs increased to such an extent that after 24 h, 96 % of
the dose was excreted in the urine. this is contrasted with dogs
given a single dose of paraben in which the 96% excretion level
was not attained until 48 h.
when 10% methylparaben or propylparaben in hydrophilic
ointment was applied to the skin of a white rabbit for 48 h, esters
and metabolites were not detected in the kidneys. the authors
noted that there was no skin irritation at this dose.
these same authors gave 70 mg/kg methylparaben orally to
a fasted man. no ester was detected in his blood or urine. after
12 h, half of the dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites,
with 11% as p-hydroxybenzoic acid (jones et al. 1956).
heim et al. (1957) reported that mouse liver perfused with
ethylparaben rapidly hydrolyzed it to the free acid within
60 min. when given orally to dogs at 25 to 500 mg/kg, no ethylparaben was detected in their blood until a dose of 500 mg/kg
was reached.
no ethylparaben was detected in the blood of six humans 4
h following oral administration of 10 to 20 mg/kg. high serum
concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoic acid appeared rapidly. the
authors stated that ethylparaben, ingested in food by man, was
probably completely hydrolyzed within 3 min after absorption
(heim et al. 1957).
tsukamoto and terada (1960, 1962) studied the metabolic
fate of methylparaben in rabbits. the compound was given
by gastric intubation, and urine was analyzed by paper chromatography. three major metabolites, p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
p-hydroxyhippuric acid, and p-carboxyphenyl glucuronide, as
well as two minor metabolites, p-hydroxybenzoyl glucuronide
and p-carboxyphenyl sulfate, were identified. rabbits given
orally 0.4 or 0.8 g/kg methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, or butylparaben excreted only 0.2% to 0.9% of the unchanged ester by 24 h. urinary excretion of p-hydroxybenzoic
acid was slower with increasing carbon chain length of the
paraben alkyl group. excretion of the conjugated acid was approximately that of the free acid. at 24 h following paraben administration, 25% to 39% was recovered as p-hydroxybenzoic
acid, 15% to 29% as the glycine conjugate, 5% to 8% as the
ester glucuronide, 10% to 18% as the ether glucuronide, and 7%
to 12% as the sulfate.
the metabolism of methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben was studied in rats by derache and gourdon (1963).
animals were given orally 100 mg of ester. blood and urine were
collected regularly and analyzed by paper chromatography.
paraben metabolites were identified in the urine 30 min after
dosing. no unchanged paraben was detected. ninety minutes
after dosing, excretion of metabolites was maximum; thereafter,

27

excretion decreased. p-hydroxyhippuric acid appeared in the
urine after 30 min; its concentration then increased evenly during
the next 4 h. the glucuronide and ethereal sulfate metabolites
appeared only between 30 and 75 min post ingestion.
after 90 min, 67% to 75% of the total paraben dose
was excreted as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 10% to 12.5% as phydroxyhippuric acid, and 8% to 10% as glucuronyl derivatives.
the concentration of free p-hydroxybenzoic acid in the blood
remained extremely low. a continuous rise occurred within the
first hour, but the concentration thereafter decreased and leveled
off 1 to 2 h after ingestion.
the authors concluded that there were two stages of paraben
detoxification: (1) absorption of paraben and excretion in urine
of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and (2) metabolic detoxification
by glucuronic-, sulfo-, and glycino-conjugation (derache and
gourdon 1963).
tsukamoto and terada (1964) dosed four male rabbits weighing between 2.25 and 3.50 kg with a 12% solution of 800 or
400 mg/kg of isobutylparaben (as the sodium salt) via a stomach tube. a 24-h urine sample was collected and analyzed via
paper chromatography. between 25% and 33% of the isobutylparaben dose was metabolized to free p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
16% to 31% became p-hydroxybenzoic acid conjugated with
glycine, and 7% to 17% was recovered as p-hydroxybenzoic
acid conjugated with one of the following three acids: ester-type
glucuronic acid, ether-type glucuronic acid, or  xxxd3258xxx . in
total, between 77% and 85% of the isobutylparaben was recovered as one of the above-mentioned forms of p-hydroxybenzoic
acid. between 0.2% and 0.9% of isobutylparaben was detected in the urine as the unchanged alkyl ester. no explanation was offered as to why ∼20% of the initial dose was not
recovered.
phillips et al. (1978) conducted a metabolic study on 14 c ring–
labeled ethylparaben and propylparaben. compounds were administered orally to groups of four male cats at doses of 156 and
158 mg/kg, respectively. urine was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h;
feces were collected at 72 h. at 72 h, total recovery was 96%
for ethylparaben and 95.6% for propylparaben. approximately
90% of the 14 c label was recovered in the urine at 24 h, whereas
6% and 3%, respectively, were recovered in the feces. analysis
of urine by thin-layer chromatography revealed only two major metabolites: p-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-hydroxyhippuric
acid. the authors concluded that both parabens were rapidly
and totally excreted in the urine within 72 h following oral
administration.
skin metabolism
hansen and möllgaard (1990) reported an experiment using
full thickness human skin and methylparaben and butylparaben.
they noted that the parabens were converted to the alkyl alcohol
and p-hydroxybenzoic acid, in a dose-dependent manner following michaelis-menton kinetics. they interpreted these findings
as suggestive of enzymatic action in the skin. no further details
were provided.

cosmetic ingredient review

lobemeier et al. (1996) examined the hydroylsis of parabens
to hydroxybenzoic acid by extracts from different layers of the
skin. they used the absorbance shift of the parabens (absorbance
of parabens can be seen at 300 nm, whereas there is no absorbance of hydroxybenzoic acid at 300 nm) to determine if
parabens were metabolized by extracts prepared from different
skin layers. because there is so much ultraviolet (uv) absorbing
material in skin extracts, it was necessary to extract parabens and
hydroxybenzoic acid from the reaction mixture. they tested recovery from standard reaction mixtures without incubation that
had been spiked with free hydroxybenzoic acid and parabens.
recovery of 1 nmol of free hydroxybenzoic acid from reaction
mixtures was stated to be 0.995 to 1.018 nmol. virtually all of
4 nmol parabens with which reaction mixes were spiked was
recovered.
extracts were prepared from human abdominal skin. the
cutis, subcutaneous fat, and stratum basale/stratum spinosum
(skin keratinocytes) extract were each used. in addition, transformed keratinocytes in culture were used to prepare an extract
and an extract of whole blood also was used. skin keratinocytes
did not produce reliable quantitative results. the subcutaneous
fat extract produced the most hydrolysis for methyl-, ethyl-,
propyl-, and butylparaben, although the activity decreased with
increased chain length (e.g., methylparaben butylparaben).
the transformed keratinocyte extract had the opposite pattern,
activity increased with increased chain length. the cutis extract
was not significantly different across the parabens. comparative
results for the blood extract were not given.
the authors isolated the enzymatic activity in each extract
using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and tested the material in each band against each of the parabens. they reported
one b-type carboxylesterase in subcutaneous fat that was maximally active with methylparaben and decreased in activity
as the chain length increased to the butylparaben. a second
b-type carboxylesterase in subcutaneous fat preferred butylparaben as a substrate. a third b-type carboxylesterase in keratinocytes also preferred butylparaben as a substrate. a fourth
carboxylesterase was present in human blood, but was not further
characterized.
the authors concluded that the keratinocyte carboxylesterase
was sufficient to completely hydrolyze the traces of parabens
that may enter the skin from topically applied ointments. they
speculated that the involvement of b-type carboxylesterases,
which also catalyze acyl transfer reactions, may contribute to
the hapten behavior of parabens in the skin and contribute to the
contact allergy occasionally observed (lobemeier et al. 1996).
bando et al. (1997) studied the effects of skin metabolism on
the percutaneous penetration of lipophilic drugs. full-thickness
rat abdominal skin (hair removed) was stripped of underlying
adipose tissue, punched into a 3-cm-diameter disk, and mounted
in a flow-through diffusion cell with propyl- and butylparaben
added to the donor solution. penetration of propyl- and butylparaben and hydroxybenzoic acid to the receptor cell was determined using hplc. determinations were made with and without

an esterase inhibitor,  xxxd2393xxx  (dfp). in the
absence of dfp, 96% of the total test material appeared in the
receptor cell as hydroxybenzoic acid. in the presence of dfp,
30% of applied propylparaben appeared in the receptor fluid
unhydrolyzed and 100% of applied butylparaben appeared unhydrolyzed.
seko et al. (1999) performed a theoretical analysis of the
effect of skin metabolism on penetration of propylparaben
and butylparaben. these authors used a two-layer diffusion/metabolism model to describe data from an in vitro skin
diffusion experiment using rat skin from which the fat layer had
been removed. diffusion was determined with and without pretreatment of the rat skin with 1 mm  xxxd2393xxx ,
an esterase inhibitor.
when parabens were applied to untreated skin, both the parent paraben and p-hydroxybenzoic acid appeared in the receiver fluid. with  xxxd2393xxx  treatment, no phydroxybenzoic acid appeared in the receptor fluid and the appearance of the parent paraben was delayed. there was also a
differential effect on the total penetration to the receptor fluid;
butylparaben penetration was decreased by 22%, compared to
a 4% reduction for propylparaben.
the authors concluded that the metabolism of parabens in
the viable layer of the skin determines the lag time for skin
penetration of intact parabens. they also noted that metabolism
in the viable skin creates a steeper concentration gradient across
the stratum corneum, increasing transport of these hydrophilic
compounds (seko et al. 1999).
fasano (2004a) conducted a study of the in vitro dermal penetration and metabolism of methylparaben and butylparaben in
rat and human skin. for each paraben, an oil in water emulsion
with both radiolabeled (14 c in the carbon ring) and nonradiolabeled paraben was prepared to a target concentration (0.8% for
methylparaben and 0.4% for butylparaben). skin samples (10
replicates for rat skin and 13 replicates for human skin) were
mounted in flow-through diffusion cells. test emulsions were
applied evenly  xxxd1891xxx  µl/cm2 , one time, with no occlusion. samples of the receptor fluid were mixed with acetonitrile, filtered,
and analyzed for methylparaben, butylparaben, and hydroxybenzoic acid using liquid chromatography coupled with mass
spectroscopy.
the majority of the radiolabeled methylparaben that penetrated rat skin to the receptor fluid had been metabolized to hydroxybenzoic acid (54%), with around 24% as unmetabolized
methylparaben. for butylparaben, 52.3% was metabolized to
hydroxybenzoic acid, with only 5.5% as unmetabolized butylparaben.
metabolism was different in human skin with 35% of methylparaben appearing as hydroxybenzoic acid and 60% remaining
as unmetabolized methylparaben. for butylparaben, 32.8% appeared as hydroxybenzoic acid and 49.7% as unmetabolized
butylparaben.
overall, based on the use of dermatomed skin, the availability
of unmetabolized methylparaben and butylparaben from oil in

parabens

water emulsions was greater in the receptor fluid with human
skin compared to rat skin.
even though only methylparaben and butylparaben were applied, the authors noted that the receptor fluid in both species also
contained detectable amounts (e.g., 200 dpm peak versus 750
dpm for hydroxybenzoic acid and 950 dpm for methylparaben)
of ethylparaben (fasano 2004a).
fasano (2004b) also describe the penetration and metabolism
of butylparaben using viable, full-thickness human skin. otherwise the study was conducted as described above. a total of
21% of the radiolabel penetrated to the receptor fluid after 24 h.
in contrast with the above finding, the principle metabolite, hydroxybenzoic acid, was detected in the receptor fluid, with barely
detectable levels of butylparaben and no ethylparaben, in this
study of full-thickness skin. the author concluded that the firstpass metabolism of butylparaben produced complete hydrolysis
to hydroxybenzoic acid.
this work was repeated (fasano 2005) to again examine
the penetration and metabolism of butylparaben (0.4%) in an
oil/water emulsion applied to the same full thickness viable human skin described above. a finite dose (10 µl/cm2 ) of the emulsion was applied to the skin surface and remained in contact
over a 24-h period without occlusion. [14 c]butylparaben (labeled in the carbon ring) was measured in the receptor fluid. a
mean value of 14.9% (±3.73%) of the radioactive label penetrated the full thickness human skin after 24 h. the principle metabolite, hydroxybenzoic acid, was found in the receptor fluid (mean of 15.2% ± 5.23%) of all 10 replications
(skin donated from two individuals), but barely detectable levels of the parent butylparaben (mean of 0.225% ± 0.063%)
were found only in 5 of 10 replications. the authors interpreted
these results to confirm the near complete first-pass metabolism
of butylparaben to p-hydroxybenzoic acid in human
skin.
excretion
kiwada et al. (1979) injected radiolabeled ethylparaben (14 c
in the carbon ring) into the femoral vein or the duodenum of rats
at a dose of 2 mg/kg. excretion of it and its metabolites in the
urine and bile was determined at fixed intervals by scintillation
counting. excretion was complete within 5 h. little unmetabolized ethylparaben was detected in samples of urine (0.03%)
and bile (none detected). radiolabeled metabolites recovered in
the urine were 83.5% of the dose injected into the duodenum
and 91.3% of that injected intravenously. those recovered in
the bile were 12.8% and 5.97%, respectively. the authors stated
that the results suggested that hydrolysis of ethylparaben to phydroxybenzoic acid and metabolism of the latter was rapid and
complete.
antimicrobial effects
the antimicrobial activity of parabens has been extensively
reported. this section highlights aspects of that activity.

29

loos (1935) reported that benzylparaben at 0.01% was effective in preventing the growth of the fungi epidermophyton
interdigitale and microsporum audouni.
neidig and burrell (1944) reported that beyond ph 8, ester
hydrolysis can occur, which reduces the preservative efficacy
of parabens. cavill and vincent (1948) confirmed that the ester
chain was necessary for antimicrobial activity and additionally
reported that any branching (e.g., isobutyl versus butyl) reduced
the effectiveness.
murrell and vincent (1950) reported that the activity of
parabens increases as the length of the alkyl chain. atkins (1950)
stated that, although antimicrobial activity increases as the alkyl
chain length increases, the water solubility decreases—because
microbial replication generally occurs in the water phase of
oil/water formulations, the amount of paraben in the water phase
generally determines preservative effectiveness. lang and rye
(1972, 1973) observed that the higher activity of the long-chain
esters over the shorter-chain esters resulted from greater uptake
of the former by bacterial cells. these authors suggested that
because parabens are lipophilic, the action site was probably the
cell membrane.
gottfried (1962) stated that location of the phenolic hydroxy
group on the benzene ring can increase or decrease the antimicrobial activity of parabens.
bronswijk and koekkoek (1971) tested the activity
of methylparaben against dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
(house dust mite). methylparaben at 0%, 1%, 5%, or 7% was
added to cultures, which were then incubated for 28 days.
growth of mites was suppressed by 1% methylparaben; at 5%
and 7% mite growth was completely inhibited.
furr and russell (1972a, 1972b, 1972c) explained the lack of
preservative activity of methylparaben and ethylparaben against
serratia marcescens when they noted that methylparaben and
ethylparaben were not taken up by whole cells and isolated
cell walls of s. marcescens, whereas propylparaben and butylparaben were taken up and induced cell wall leakage.
according to freese et al. (1973), parabens inhibit cellular oxidation by inhibiting compounds that donate electrons to
the electron-transport mechanism of the cell. the deficiency
of these donating compounds resulted from paraben-induced
transport inhibition of substrates into the cell. in membrane
vesicles of bacilus subtilis, uptake of l-serine,  xxxd2460xxx , and
l-malate was inhibited by parabens. lipophilic acids, such as
the parabens, are known to uncouple substrate transport and oxidative phosphorylation of the electron transport system of the
cell.
allwood (1973) reported that nonionic surfactants at low concentrations may have a synergistic effect with parabens, whereas
higher concentrations of the surfactant inhibit preservative activity.
close and neilson (1976) identified a propylparabenresistant strain of pseudomonas cepacia with esterases able to
hydrolyze propylparaben and use the metabolites as a carbon
source.

cosmetic ingredient review

according to shiralkar et al. (1976), growth inhibition occurs
only after a minimum concentration of paraben is reached; once
this value is exceeded, inhibition is rapid. shiralkar et al. (1977)
reported that propylparaben was taken up by bacterial cells; 95%
within 2 min after being added to cultures.
o’neill and mead (1982) studied the preservative capacity
of parabens against aspergillus niger, enterobacter hafnia, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, penicillium species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. cepacia, pseudomonas putida, serratia liquifaciens, s. marcescens, and serratia rubidaea. methylparaben in oil emulsions at 0.8% was effective against a very
resistant s. marcescens isolate, ed-2. equally effective was a
mix of 0.4% of methylparaben and 0.4% ethylparaben. methylparaben at 0.4% was not effective, nor was a mix of 0.4%
methylparaben and 0.4% propylparaben. the authors concluded
that methylparaben is the most effective preservative among
the parabens and recommended that it should be used at the
highest practical concentration and supplemented with ethylparaben only when there is some limitation on the concentration
of methylparaben.
nes and eklund (1983) reported the effect of methyl-,
propyl-, and butylparaben on dna, rna, and protein synthesis in esherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. cell cultures were
made permeable by toluene treatment (0.075 ml in 7.5 ml resuspension of washed cells) and stored frozen (liquid nitrogen) in
buffer at a cell concentration between 5 and 10 × 109 cells/ml.
dna synthesis was measured by adding standard mixtures of
buffer, atp, unlabeled dna precursors, and 3 h-labeled dttp
to toluenized cells. rna synthesis was performed in a similar
fashion, except that rna precursors were used with 3 h-labeled
dutp. protein synthesis was done using a poly(u) substrate with
buffer, atp, gtp, and 14 c-phenylalanine with each of the other
19 amino acids unlabeled, mixed with phosphoenolpyruvate,
phosphoenolpyruvate kinase, and the s30 fraction from either
e. coli or b. subtilis.
no significant differences were seen between the two bacterial strains in dna and rna synthesis. inhibition of dna
synthesis was greatest with butylparaben and least with methylparaben. for all parabens, dna synthesis inhibition increased
as a function of the paraben concentration. the same pattern
was seen for rna synthesis. although protein synthesis was
inhibited by parabens in the same order described above, the
effect was much less in b. subtilis compared to e. coli. the authors speculated that dna, rna, and protein synthesis could
be targets affected by parabens (nes and eklund 1983).

protein binding
tzortzatou and hayhoe (1974) reported that methylparaben
and propylparaben increased the activity of  xxxg631xxx  and methotrexate inhibition of this enzyme. the authors
suggested that the action of the parabens is due to induced conformational changes in the enzyme, which increase its affinity
for dihydrofolate.

albumin
patel (1968) reported that methylparaben, ethylparaben,
propylparaben, and butylparaben bind to bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa). binding increased with increasing ester chain length.
the binding process is endothermic and hydrophilic in nature.
additionally, protein-bound paraben is devoid of its antifungal
activity.
jun et al. (1971) used a fluorescent probe to determine that the
paraben sidechain is the primary binding site to bsa. brodersen
(1974) and echeverria et al. (1975) observed that methylparaben
and propylparaben bilirubin to  xxxg124xxx  at concentrations
of 400 µg/ml.
rasmussen et al. (1976) observed that, whereas methylparaben and propylparaben bind to  xxxg124xxx , only methylparaben displaces bilirubin from albumin. methylparaben is
a weak primary site competitor and a strong secondary site
competitor. they reported that at plasma concentrations of
340 µmol/l or greater, methylparaben competes with bilirubin only when the high-affinity binding sites on  xxxg124xxx 
approach saturation.
loria et al. (1976) observed that methylparaben interacts with
components of icteric newborn sera, increasing the availability
of free, unconjugated bilirubin.
otagiri and perrin (1977) reported that the serum albuminbinding constant increases significantly from propylparaben to
butylparaben.
cytotoxicity
ansel and cadwallader (1964) examined the effects
of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben on human and rabbit erythrocytes in vitro. butylparaben, at 0.02%, induced hemolysis in 12% of the rabbit
and 6% of the human erythrocytes. concentrations of 0.25%
methylparaben, 0.17% ethylparaben, and 0.05% propylparaben
induced no hemolysis.
krauze and fitak (1971) tested methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben in cultures of embryonic mouse
fibroblasts. they reported significantly reduced biosynthesis of
rna and dna. the incorporation of 32 p into rna and dna of
whole cells was inhibited by 0.2 g/l ethylparaben only. none
of the parabens affected the protein content of the cell cultures.
sheu et al. (1975) determined that the doses of methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben that produced 50%
cell inhibition (ic50 ) in hela cells were 1.3, 0.6, and 0.22 mm,
respectively. these were similar to ic50 values in b. subtilis and
e. coli. in hela cells, parabens induced jagged cell shapes; cell
processes were shortened, branched, rough-edged, and curved.
many perinuclear and cytoplasmic granules were also observed.
the authors stated that growth inhibition of bacteria by parabens
was due to inhibition of cellular uptake of amino acids and other
compounds needed for substrate and energy supply.
brown et al. (1978b) reported that contact lenses treated with
0.02% propylparaben were cytotoxic to the l929 strain of mouse
fibroblasts and s3 hela cells.

parabens

ishiwatari et al. (2005) studied the effect of methylparaben
on human keratinocytes in culture. epilife-kg-2 medium was
used to grow the cells to confluence and then they were subcultured using epilife-kg-2 medium containing 0.001% or
0.003% methylparaben. control cultures received no methylparaben after subculturing. cells were counted and the number
of population doublings determined, along with the number of
apoptotic cells.
until day 20, control and methylparaben-treated cultures
grew at the same rate. after day 20 (at just over 8 doublings),
the rate of growth for cultures treated with methylparaben
slowed. at 70 days, the controls had leveled off at around 19
doublings and the treated cells leveled off at around 16 doublings. there was no difference between the two methylparaben
concentrations.
apoptotic cells were determined at time 0, 16 days, and
32 days. there was no difference between control and treated
cultures at 16 days, but at 32 days apoptotic cells had increased to around 9% in the 0.003% methylparaben culture
and 5% in the 0.001% methylparaben culture. necrotic cells
exhibited the same pattern, except that at 32 days there were
almost 60% necrotic cells in the 0.003% methylparaben culture compared to an almost indistinguishable difference between the control and 0.001% methylparaben groups. the authors also noted morphological changes in the keratinocytes
treated with methylparaben—they became enlarged and flattened. the authors speculated that methylparaben exposure
might influence the aging and differentiation of keratinocytes
and might induce dermatological disorders (ishiwatari et al.
2005).

phototoxicity
handa et al. (2005) exposed human keratinocytes in culture
to uv radiation, with and without methylparaben pretreatment;
and at various methylparaben concentrations without uv radiation. cell viability was determined at 6 and 24 h for methylparaben concentrations of 0.003%, 0.03%, and 0.3%. at 6 h,
the highest methylparaben concentration that did not cause a
reduction in cell viability compared to controls was 0.03%; at
24 h, that concentration was 0.003%. a concentration of 0.03%
was chosen for the uv experiments.
cells were cultured with 0.03% methylparaben to confluence, the medium was removed and replaced with phospatebuffered saline. cultures were exposed to fluorescent sunlamps (30% uva, 54% uvb, 0.2% uvc) to levels of uvb
of 15 or 30 mj/cm2 . there was no indication that uva and
uvc radiation were filtered out. after exposure, cells were
again incubated in culture medium (without methylparaben).
the number of necrotic or apoptotic cells was determined by
staining.
no apoptotic cells were found in any of the control or
treatment cultures. cultures receiving no uv exposure and no
methylparaben had 2.27% (± 0.11%) necrotic cells. the com-

plete results of the various combinations of exposures to uv and
methylparaben are given in table 19.
the authors concluded that methylparaben itself appeared to
have no effect on the number of necrotic cells, but it did increase
the number of necrotic cells produced as a result of uv radiation
exposure (handa et al. 2005).
in a commentary on this study, shiseido co., ltd. (2005)
noted that the absorption maximum for methylparaben is 256 nm
in the uvc region and that at 300 nm, the absorption is not
significant. because the light source used by handa et al. (2005)
contained 0.2% uvc, not found in sunlight at the earth’s surface,
it was suggested that the phenomenon is not relevant to normal
solar exposures.
tissue effects
pomerat and leake (1954) studied methylparaben for toxicity to tissue cultures of embryonic chicken spleen and adult human skin. in splenic tissue, concentrations of 520 to 1040 µg/ml
inhibited growth, whereas concentrations of 30 to 60 µg/ml induced detectable injury. in cultures of skin, concentrations required for least growth inhibition and detectable injury were 175
to 350 µg/ml and 140 to 175 µg/ml, respectively.
white (1967) studied the effects of methylparaben and
propylparaben on cultured embryonic chicken femoral bones in
vitro. at concentrations of 0.25 and 2.5 µg/ml methylparaben,
bone weight was significantly increased. significant growth also
occurred at 0.025 to 2.5 µg/ml propylparaben concentrations.
when mixtures of the two were tested, growth inhibition occurred, even at the lowest concentration tested (0.025 g/ml of
each). the authors suggested that the parabens’ effect may be
due to their ability to stabilize lysosomes.
mostow et al. (1979) studied the effects of methylparaben
and propylparaben on the ciliary activity of epithelial cells in
cultures of ferret tracheal rings. propylparaben, at 0.06 mg/ml
and greater, paralyzed cilia; at 0.5 mg/ml and greater, paralysis
was irreversible. methylparaben was a potent inhibitor of ciliary
activity. the authors suggested that topical respiratory anesthesia with paraben-containing solutions may result in prolonged
ciliary paralysis.
nerve tissue
nathan and sears (1961) reported the effects of 0.1% and
0.2% methylparaben on vagus and sympathetic nerves and

32

cosmetic ingredient review

spinal nerve roots, in vivo, in cats. when applied directly,
methylparaben blocked nerve impluse conduction in myelinated
and unmyelinated nerves. conduction block was reversible and
anesthetic-like. the authors suggested that injection of methylparaben may cause degeneration in a number of the surrounding
nerves.
kitamura (1979) studied the anesthetic effect of perfused
parabens on the isolated peripheral nerve and isolated spinal cord
of the frog. methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben
blocked nerve conduction. the action of propylparaben was
higher than that of methylparaben. total nerve block occurred
at concentrations of 1 mm for the former and 5 mm for the
latter. the lowest concentration of methylparaben required for
conduction block was higher than that of all local anesthetics
tested, whereas effective concentrations of propylparaben were
comparable to the anesthetics. the author concluded that, as
preservatives in anesthetic solutions, methylparaben and propylparaben may intensify the action of the anesthetic.
muscle
karasek and slavicek (1967) studied the effect of methylparaben on the sensitivity of the isolated frog rectus abdominus
muscle to acetylcholine (ach). methylparaben application instantaneously potentiated the sensitivity of the muscle to ach.
activity increased gradually with higher methylparaben concentrations. the authors suggested that the action of methylparaben may be a result of its ability to increase permeability
and facilitate the penetration of ach into the motor endplates.
the effect of methylparaben and propylparaben on smooth
muscle of isolated guinea pig trachea was studied by geddes
and lefcoe (1973). both compounds induced dose-dependent,
rapid, reversible relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle. in addition, these ingredients potentiated  xxxd2401xxx  and dibutyryl
 xxxd1773xxx  (amp) at concentrations of
10 µg/ml methylparaben and 1.5 µg/ml propylparaben. the
authors suggested that the bronchodilation effect of parabens
may be due to their inhibition of phosphodiesterase.
jones et al. (1975) studied the effect of methylparaben on the
isolated trachea of guinea pigs, isolated jejunum of rabbits, and
mammalian atrial preparations. methylparaben induced weak,
dose-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle; it did not, however, affect atrial preparations.
subthreshold concentrations significantly enhanced the tracheal response to three catecholamines and two noncatechol
sympathomimetics, but did not enhance the response to a xanthine derivative.
the authors concluded that these results suggest that methylparaben has a nonspecific spasmolytic action, possibly related
to its anesthetic effects. enhancement of catecholamine response suggested that methylparaben inhibits extraneural removal of catecholamine. the authors noted that the direct action
of methylparaben could have clinical implications, because injection of drugs containing as little as 1.5 mg/ml methylparaben
would result in a dose of this compound much greater than that

required to augment the catecholamine response (jones et al.
1975).

physiological effects
bubnoff et al. (1957) studied the anticonvulsive and vasodilating effects of parabens. they reported that methylparaben
and ethylparaben had anticonvulsive effects in rats with cocaineinduced cramps. intravenous administration was four times more
effective than oral administration in controlling cramps. methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben had
vascular-widening properties in cat brain blood vessels upon
intra-arterial injection. only slight effects were observed upon
intravenous injection. they reported spasmolytic action in cerebral vessels of cats after intravertebral injection of 5 mg/kg of
benzylparaben. the authors concluded that a relationship may
exist between the effects of parabens as vasodilators and anticonvulsants.
adler-hradecky and kelentey (1960) tested methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben for surface
analgesia in rats, infiltration analgesia in guinea pigs, and conduction anesthesia in frogs. surface analgesia was studied by
applying parabens (0.01%) to rabbit skin and measuring the
response time to stimulation. all parabens tested had no anesthetic effect. infiltration analgesia was tested by injecting intradermally 0.25 ml of a 1% paraben solution into the dorsal skin of
guinea pigs. analgesic effect was measured as the time following injection until the animal reacted to three of five pin pricks at
the injection site. all parabens had no significant effects. in the
conduction anesthesia study, isolated frog muscle-nerve preparations were treated with 1% parabens and then electrically stimulated. conduction was measured by the electric potential required to stimulate muscle contraction. only butylparaben and
propylparaben significantly (but slightly) inhibited contraction
when compared to controls.
goodwin et al. (1979) identified methylparaben as a component of vaginal secretions of female dogs in estrus. analysis
of secretions at other points of their estrous cycle revealed no
presence of methylparaben. male and female dogs (not in estrus) were introduced for 5 to 7 min, during which time no
sexual behavior was exhibited by the males. a small amount of
methylparaben was then applied to the vulva of each female;
animals were again paired. in 18 of 21 individual trials, males
attempted intercourse following intense anogenital investigation
of the females. the authors suggested that methylparaben is a
sex pheromone of the dog.
person (1985) noted that methylparaben has been identified
as the main volatile component of vaginal secretions of female
beagle dogs during estrus. application of pure methylparaben
to the vulva and in the vagina of anestrus females reportedly resulted in sexual arousal of males, with mounting as if the females
were in estrus. the author opines that avoiding methylparabencontaining creams “could possibly relieve the mounting tensions
of dog owners throughout the world.”

parabens

hamilton et al. (1990) used an in vitro system to study
the direct cerebrovascular effect of pure succinylcholine, 1.8
mg/ml methylparaben, 0.2 mg/ml propylparaben, 1.8 mg/ml
methylparaben, 0.2 mg/ml propylparaben combined, a multidose prescription rx form of succinylcholine (20 mg/ml) containing 1.8 mg/ml methylparaben and 0.2 mg/ml propylparaben,
a multidose rx form of succinylcholine (20 mg/ml) containing
1.0 mg/ml methylparaben or a single dose rx form without
parabens. basilar artery preparations from dogs and guinea pigs
were treated with methylparaben or propylparaben, pure succinylcholine, or the three prescription forms of succinylcholine.
measurements were taken of the basilar artery precontracted
with kcl. pure succinylcholine or the single dose form had no
statistically significant effect, but the multidose rx forms did
cause relaxation of the artery. vasodilation was seen in direct
proportion to the amounts of parabens present.
to examine the possible role of the arterial endothelium,
measurements were taken of arteries in which the endothelium had been rubbed off. no difference was seen compared
to arteries with an intact endothelium. the authors speculated
that the site of action of the parabens, therefore, was most
likely directly on the arterial smooth muscle (hamilton et al.
1990).
pompy et al. (1991) examined the effect of paraben preservatives on intracranial pressure in vivo using cats. succinylcholine,
with and without paraben preservatives, and paraben preservatives alone were injected into each of six anesthetized and instrumented cats in specific sequences. contrary to the in vitro finding
discussed above, preservative-free succinylcholine did produce
an increase in intracranial pressure that was not statistically different from succinylcholine with 1.8 mg/ml methylparaben and
0.2 mg/ml propylparaben (the prescription version); both were
statistically significantly increased over controls. injection of 1.8
mg/ml methylparaben and 0.2 mg/ml propylparaben produced
an increase in one animal, but not in the other five, and the overall
effect was of a nonsignificant increase in intracranial pressure
compared to controls. these authors reported that there was a
small, transitory decrease in arterial pressure, consistent with
in vitro findings, suggesting that parabens have some systemic
vasodilatory effect.
gelb et al. (1992) further examined the effects of parabens
on cerebral vasodilation and intracranial pressure in healthy
humans. cerebral blood flow was determined with inhaled
133
xenon in eight volunteers and cerebral blood flow velocity was determined using transcranial doppler ultrasound in
a different group of eight volunteers. methylparaben (9 mg)
and propylparaben (1 mg) were given together intravenously to
mimic the preservative that would be given in a 100 mg dose of
a commercially available multidose vial of succinylcholine. no
adverse hemodynamic or neurological effects resulted from the
paraben injection. although the authors stated that they could not
discount the possibility that parabens could have an effect in the
presence of cerebral dysfunction and impaired autoregulation,
they concluded that these findings and those in cats described

33

above, suggest no adverse effects of parabens on intracranial
pressure.
noting that methylparaben has been reported to have pharmacological effects, harvey et al. (1992) attempted to examine
the effect of methylparaben on cyclic nucleotides (camp and
cgmp) and  xxxg1696xxx  isozymes using male wistar rats (200 to 250 g). the authors described the
characteristics of the various phosphodiesterase isozymes as follows: form i has affinity for both camp and cgmp; form ii was
stimulated by micromolar concentrations of cgmp, but binds
both camp and cgmp; and form iv is insensitive to cgmp
and sensitive to camp. methylparaben (0.4%) in feed was provided to five groups of four rats over a period of 3 weeks. an
additional five groups of four rats served as control animals. at
the end of the exposure period, the animals were killed, cortices were dissected and halved. for each group, two right and
two left halves were processed for cyclic nucleotide determinations and the other halves were processed for phosphodiesterase
separation and activity.
there was a statistically significant drop in camp levels and
a small, but statistically significant, increase in cgmp levels
in the methylparaben group. three separate phosphodiesterase
isozymes (i, ii, and iv) were identified and assayed. no significant effect of methylparaben was seen on two of the isozymes
(forms i and ii), but phosphodiesterase iv activity was increased. given the small increase in cgmp levels the authors
expressed surprise that phosphodiesterase forms i and ii were
not increased. the authors did not comment on the increase
in phosphodiesterase iv, given the decrease in camp levels.
the authors concluded that these results provide support for a
methylparaben effect on cell membranes (harvey et al. 1992).

toxic effects mechanisms
nakagawa and moldéus (1998) used isolated rat hepatocytes
and mitochondria to examine the mechanism of toxic effects of
parabens. incubation of rat hepatocytes with concentrations of
propylparaben of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm produced cell death that
increased with both concentration and time of incubation with
the control group exhibiting minimal cell death over the 3-h incubation time. the authors postulated that diazinon, an esterase
inhibitor, would reduce the toxic effect if p-hydroxybenzoic
acid is responsible for the damage. addition of 100 µm diazinon to 1.0 mm propylparaben increased the cytotoxicity of
propylparaben over the 3-h incubation time, suggesting that phydroxybenzoic acid is not the active agent.
the effect of different parabens (at 2.0 mm) was determined by measuring cell death, atp, adenine nucleotide pools,
and mitochondrial membrane potential during a 1-h incubation. methylparaben produced the least toxic effects and
isobutylparaben produced the most. the authors concluded
there was no difference in toxicity between isomers (propylparaben/isopropylparaben and butylparaben/ isobutylparaben).
table 20 presents those results.

significantly different from control.

the authors also determined the effect of parabens on respiration in isolated hepatocyte mitochondria (in the presence of
 xxxd83xxx  [atp]; state 3). the authors concluded
that the decrease in oxygen uptake in state 3 was greater with
the longer-chain parabens compared to the shorter ones, and no
difference between chain isomers.
overall, the authors concluded that the effects of parabens on
isolated rat hepatocytes was mediated by reduced mitochondrial
function, the consequent reduction in atp, and limitation of
all energy-requiring functions, eventually leading to cell death
(nakagawa and moldéus 1998).
animal toxicology
acute oral toxicity
methylparaben
litton bionetics (1974) performed a series of acute oral toxicity studies using rats. methylparaben in 0.85% saline was administered orally to groups of 5 to 10 rats at doses of 100 to 5000
mg/kg. animals were observed for 10 days and then killed. all
10 animals receiving 5000 mg/kg died within 24 h. necropsy
findings included reddened gastric mucosa and congested lungs.
no animals died at 100 and 500 mg/kg. the acute oral ld50 was
determined to be 2100 mg/kg.
these authors repeated the study using methylparaben as a
21.8% saline suspension orally to each of 10 rats at a dose of
5000 mg/kg. animals were observed for 7 days and then killed.
no toxicity, abnormal behavior, or gross lesions were observed.
methylparaben at 37% to 79% was administered orally to
groups of six male rats at doses of 2600 to 5600 mg/kg. animals
were observed for 7 days and then killed. no toxicity, abnormal
behavior, or gross lesions were observed. the authors concluded
that the rat acute oral ld50 for 21.8% to 79% methylparaben
was >5600 mg/kg (litton bionetics 1974).
ctfa (1976a) reported a study in which methylparaben was
administered by gastric intubation to five female rats at a dose
of 15,000 mg/kg. all animals appeared normal throughout the

study, and there were no gross lesions at necropsy on the seventh
day.
products containing 0.2% or 0.8% methylparaben administered by gastric intubation to rats at doses up to 15,000 mg/kg
caused no deaths (ctfa 1979a, 1979b, 1981a; leberco laboratories 1978a, 1979a).

ethylparaben
moriyama et al. (1975) administered ethylparaben by gastric intubation to groups of four female rats at doses of 2, 20,
and 200 mg/kg. rats were observed for 1 week and then killed.
no animals died as a result of treatment, and body weights increased normally. no macroscopic abnormalities were found at
necropsy.
ctfa (1980a) reported that ethylparaben was tested for
acute oral toxicity as a 20% dilution in  xxxd3034xxx . doses
of 4.64 or 2.15 g/kg were administered by gastric intubation to
groups of five female rats. three deaths resulted from administration of the higher dose and none from the lower dose. there
were no gross lesions at necropsy on the seventh day. the acute
oral ld50 was 4.30 g/kg.
products containing 0.2% ethylparaben produced no deaths
when administered to groups of five rats at a dose of 15 g/kg
(ctfa 1981b, 1981c).

propylparaben
products containing 0.2% or 0.3% propylparaben caused no
deaths when administered to rats at doses of 15 g/kg (ctfa
1977a; leberco laboratories 1978b).

butylparaben
products containing 0.2% or 0.3% butylparaben produced
no deaths when administered orally to rats at doses of 5 and 25
g/kg, respectively (ctfa 1976b, 1980b).

parabens

benzylparaben
loos (1935) stated that no deaths or toxic signs were reported
when up to 10 g/kg of benzylparaben was given by oral intubation to groups of slc-ddy mice.
sabalitschka and neufeld-crzellitzer (1954) fed two guinea
pigs 2 g of benzylparaben per day; no injurious effects to the
animals were noted. the duration of dosing was unspecified.
ctfa (1985) reported a study in which 5 g/kg of benzylparaben given to groups of charles river cd rats produced no
deaths.
comparing parabens
schuebel (1930) reported that the acute toxic/lethal oral doses
for individual parabens in dogs and rabbits were as follows:
methylparaben, 2 and 3 g/kg, respectively; ethylparaben, 4 and
5 g/kg; and propylparaben, 3 to 4 and 6 g/kg. toxicity decreased
as the alkyl chain length increased.
matthews et al. (1956) determined the acute oral toxicity of
parabens and their sodium salts in an unspecified number of
mice. test compounds were suspended in 3% starch, propylene
glycol, or olive oil. animals were observed for 1 week post
treatment.
the reported acute oral ld50 values were methylparaben,
>8000 mg/kg; methylparaben (na salt), 2000 mg/kg; ethylparaben (na salt), 2500 mg/kg; propylparaben, >8000 mg/kg;
propylparaben (na salt), 3700 mg/kg; and butylparaben (na
salt), 950 mg/kg. the authors concluded that as the alkyl chain
length increased, toxicity increased due to longer hydrolysis
times (matthews et al. 1956).
multiple parabens
applied research laboratories (1939) administered a 60:40
mixture of the sodium salts of propylparaben and ethylparaben,
respectively, orally to groups of 5 to 10 guinea pigs at doses
of 4.75 to 6.0 g/kg to determine the minimum lethal dose (the
smallest dose required to induce 60 to 80% mortality). animals
were observed for 10 days post treatment. the minimum lethal
dose was determined to be 5.0 g/kg.
sado (1973) studied the acute oral toxicity of ethylparaben,
propylparaben, butylparaben, and paraben combinations in ddstrain mice. the acute oral ld50 values for ethyl-, propyl-, and
butylparabens were 6008, 6332, and 13,200 mg/kg, respectively.
additional tests revealed that the toxicity of mixtures did not
exceed theoretical values, indicating that these compounds do
not exhibit synergistic toxicity.
products containing both methylparaben at 0.2% and propylparaben at 0.1% resulted in oral ld50 values in rats greater than
98.9 g/kg in one study (stillmeadow 1978a) and greater than
5 g/kg in another (ctfa 1979c).
a product containing both 0.2% propylparaben and 0.1%
butylparaben produced no deaths when administered orally at
5 ml/kg to 10 rats (ctfa 1980c).

35

acute dermal toxicity
methylparaben
a hairdressing product containing 0.2% methylparaben was
tested for acute dermal toxicity in three male and three female
albino rabbits. doses of 2.0 ml/kg were applied to intact and
abraded skin and occluded for 24 h. no toxic effects were observed for 14 days post treatment (ctfa 1981d).
multiple parabens
the acute dermal toxicity of eye makeup formulations containing 0.2% butylparaben or 0.2% methylparaben and 0.1%
propylparaben was studied using rats. the ld50 values were
greater than 2 g/kg (ctfa 1979c, 1980b).
acute subcutaneous toxicity
methylparaben
bijlsma (1928) administered methylparaben subcutaneously
to mice at doses up to 333 mg/kg. doses greater than 165 mg/kg
temporarily induced exhaustion, ataxia, and respiratory distress.
because of solubility limitations, higher doses could not be
tested. the acute lethal subcutaneous dose was reported to be
greater than 333 mg/kg, since no animals died from this dose.
homburger (1968) gave groups of eight c57bl/6 mice single subcutaneous injections of 125 mg/kg methylparaben (in
tricaprylin). this was the maximum tolerated dose for repeated
injection. injection sites in the majority of animals developed
small, ill-defined soft cysts and small ulcerations that later
healed.
mason et al. (1971) administered methylparaben subcutaneously to five groups of 20 fischer rats at doses up to 500
mg/kg (10 males/10 females per group). no animals died and
the acute ld50 was reported to be >500 mg/kg.
isobutylparaben
according to an entry in the rtecs (1993), the subcutaneous
ld50 of isobutylparaben in mice was reported to be 2.6 g/kg.
multiple parabens
adler-hradecky and kelentey (1960) administered the
sodium salts of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben,
and butylparaben subcutaneously to groups of five mice. the
reported acute ld50 values were 1.20, 1.65, 1.65, and 2.5 g/kg,
respectively.
acute intravenous toxicity
methylparaben
simonelli and marri (1939) administered methylparaben to
three rabbits at intravenous doses of 0.289, 0.69, and 0.92 g/kg.
the lowest dose induced a temporary, small drop in arterial
blood pressure. the animal receiving 0.69 g/kg had transitory
hypotension and reduced respiration. the rabbit that received
0.92 g/kg died.

cosmetic ingredient review

homburger (1968) reported on a study in which 6 a/jax mice
were each given 2.5 mg methylparaben intravenously. gasping
respiration and shock were observed immediately. animals returned to normal within 90 min.
benzylparaben
kohn (1933) stated that intravenous injection of benzylparaben (dose not given) to dogs and cats caused no variation
in blood sugar concentration of the animals. ghirardi (1940)
reported that intravenous injection of dogs with 0.7 g/kg benzylparaben produced no ill effects.
comparing parabens
matthews et al. (1956) injected methylparaben or propylparaben intravenously in dogs in increasing doses (1 to 1400
mg/kg), and the effects on the cardiovascular and autonomic
nervous system were monitored. parabens had no effect on the
nervous system. death was associated with the hypotensive action including a sharp but brief fall in blood pressure and a
corresponding rise in the jugular venous pressure. the rate of
injection and the cardiovascular effect were correlated. these
authors reported that the acute intravenous ld50 values in mice
of the sodium salts of methylparaben and propylparaben were
170 and 180 mg/kg, respectively.

acute intraperitoneal toxicity
comparing parabens
matthews et al. (1956) reported the following acute intraperitoneal ld50 values in mice for various parabens and their
salts: methylparaben, 960 mg/kg; methylparaben (na salt), 760
mg/kg; ethylparaben (na salt), 520 mg/kg; propylparaben, 640
mg/kg; propylparaben (na salt), 490 mg/kg; and butylparaben
(na salt), 230 mg/kg. test animals had fluid in the peritoneal
cavity which the authors attributed to local irritation.

acute subarachnoid toxicity
methylparaben
adams et al. (1977) studied the effect of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1%
methylparaben (in saline) on the spinal cords and spinal nerve
roots of rabbits following subarachnoid injection. vehicle controls were also used. injections were administered to groups of
four albino male rabbits; 3 days later, the animals were killed
and the spinal cords dissected and examined grossly as well as
microscopically. no animal exhibited any overt toxic effects to
the paraben treatment. although mechanical trauma caused by
the injection procedure resulted in morphologic changes in the
spinal cords, no abnormalities could be attributed to methylparaben. the authors concluded that this material produces no
neurotoxic effects, even when administered  xxxd1891xxx  times the concentration commonly used in parenteral preparations.

acute inhalation toxicity
methylparaben
jian and po (1993) reported that methylparaben is mildly
ciliotoxic to male wistar rats at an inhaled concentration of 1.18
mm (4-h exposure).
subchronic oral toxicity
methylparaben
bijlsma (1928) administered 18 mg/kg/day methylparaben
to a dog for 28 days and 53 mg/kg/day to another dog for 4 days.
the animals were killed at the end of the study. no toxicity was
reported, and no gross lesions were noted upon necropsy.
ethylparaben
moriyama et al. (1975) administered ethylparaben orally to
groups of 10 rats (5 males/5 females per group) at concentrations
of 2.0%, 1.0%, and 0.2% in the diet for 25 weeks. during the
test, no significant differences in general appearance, behavior,
food consumption, mortality, or survival times were observed
between experimental and control groups.
from weeks 22 to 25, significant increases in mean body
weight were observed in males at the 0.2% level. significant decreases in mean body weights were observed in males at the 1.0%
and 2.0% levels. values for erythrocyte numbers, hemoglobin,
hematocrit, and white blood cell counts were normal in all animals throughout the study. no macroscopic or microscopic abnormalities were observed.
these authors also administered ethylparaben by gastric intubation to three groups of four female rats at doses of 2, 20, and
200 mg/kg for 6 consecutive days. after this time, animals were
killed for necropsy. over the period of the study, body weights
increased. no animals died and no abnormalities were observed
upon necropsy (moriyama et al. 1975).
benzylparaben
ishizeki et al. (1955) reported that guinea pigs fed 1 g of
benzylparaben per day for 19 days had no signs of toxicity.
comparing parabens
inai et al. (1985) administered 0.6%, 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, and
10% isobutylparaben or butylparaben in the feed of groups of
10 male and 10 female icr/jcl mice for 6 weeks. a group of 20
males and 20 females served as a control.
all mice of the 5% and 10% dose groups died during the
first 2 weeks of the study. body weight gain percentages for
mice of the 1.25% and 2.5% groups were ∼10% of the control group. body weight gain for mice of the 0.6% dose group
was about the same as control. upon microscopic examination,
atrophy of the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes was observed
in groups dosed with 1.25% or higher. multifocal degeneration
and necrosis of the hepatic parenchyma was also noted in these
groups. no significant lesions were found in mice dosed with

parabens

0.6% isobutylparaben or butylparaben or in the control animals
(inai et al. 1985).
multiple parabens
ctfa (1980d) reported a study in which a product formulation containing 0.2% methylparaben and 0.2% propylparaben
was administered orally to groups of 10 male and 10 female
rats at doses of 0, 40, or 200 mg/kg/day for 1 month. the test
material was prepared as a 2% and 10% dispersion in corn oil
and administered daily in dose volumes of 2 ml/kg. an equal
volume of corn oil was given to control rats.
all but one rat survived, and there were no signs of toxicity in
the survivors. the one high-dose male rat that died had pneumonia, presumably caused by test material accidentally placed in
the trachea. body weight gain and food consumption were unaffected by treatment. slight changes in hematologic and blood
chemistry values and organ weights were not biologically significant. microscopic examination of the tissues revealed no
treatment-related changes (ctfa 1980d).
ctfa (1980e) reported a study in which a product formulation containing 0.2% propylparaben and 0.1% butylparaben
was tested in a 1-month oral toxicity assay identical to the one
described above.
all animals survived, and there were no signs of toxicity.
body weight gain, food consumption, and hematologic values
were similar for treated and control animals. slight changes in
blood chemistry and organ weights were considered toxicologically insignificant. microscopic examination of the tissues revealed no treatment-related changes (ctfa 1980e).
subchronic dermal toxicity
methylparaben
ctfa (1980f) reported results of a 3-month dermal toxicity
study conducted to test the effects of daily dermal exposure to
a product formulation containing 0.2% methylparaben. a treatment group of five male and five female albino rabbits received
daily topical doses of 5.5 mg/cm2 over 8.4% of the body surface area; an untreated group of seven males and seven females
served as a control.
the product caused persistent well-defined to moderate erythema, slight edema, and intermittent slight desquamation.
three test animals died during the study of conditions unrelated to treatment. body weight gain, food consumption, hematologic, and blood chemistry values were unaffected by treatment. the presence of glucose and blood in the urine of some
untreated and treated rabbits was considered clinically unimportant. histopathologic examination of tissues of all animals was
negative for treatment-related changes other than mild inflammation at the application site (ctfa 1980f).
ctfa (1980g) reported a 3-month dermal toxicity study
similar to that described above on another product formulation
containing 0.2% methylparaben. the formulation was administered to groups of five male and five female rabbits at doses

37

of 6.6 mg/cm2 and 11 mg/cm2 over 8.4% of the body surface
area.
the product caused persistent well-defined to moderate erythema, slight edema, and intermittent slight desquamation. two
untreated control animals died during the study; all treated animals survived. body weight gain, food consumption, hematologic, blood chemistries and urinalysis values, and organ
weights were negative for toxicologically significant changes.
no treatment-related changes other than mild inflammation at
the application site were found (ctfa 1980g).
comparing parabens
ctfa (1981f) reported the results of a 13-week dermal toxicity study in rats conducted on a medicated cream containing 0.7% methylparaben or a medicated lotion containing 0.3%
propylparaben. groups of 10 rats received daily topical doses of
the cream at 4.12 g/kg; a control group consisted of 10 untreated
animals. all applications were made to the anterior dorsal shaved
skin, which represented 10% to 15% of the total body surface
area.
all animals survived the full term of the study. significant
depression in body weight gain was noted for males of both test
groups. slight changes in hematologic and blood chemistry parameters and organ weights were considered toxicologically insignificant. significant gross and histopathologic changes were
limited to the treated skin site. the investigators concluded that
there were no cumulative systemic toxic effects from these products (ctfa 1981f).
multiple parabens
ctfa (1981e) reported a 3-month dermal toxicity study on a
product formulation containing 0.2% methylparaben and 0.2%
propylparaben. rabbits were assigned to two untreated control
groups and three treatment groups. each group contained six or
eight animals, with an equal distribution of males and females.
the formulation was administered at doses of 2 and 6 mg/cm2
over 10% of the body surface area.
after dosing, rabbits in one control group and one group
treated with 6 mg/cm2 of the product were exposed daily to
one-half the minimal erythema dose of uv radiation (4 min at
6 inches from westinghouse fs-20 lamps producing uv in the
range of 280 to 400 nm).
the product alone caused persistent moderate erythema,
slight edema, and mild desquamation. epidermal fissures with
bleeding and papuloerythema were observed occasionally. the
high dose was slightly more irritating than the low dose. uv
exposure had no apparent effect on the severity of the irritation.
two test animals died during the study of conditions unrelated
to treatment. body weight gain, food consumption, and hematologic, blood chemistry, and urinalysis values were negative
for toxicologically significant findings. mild to severe dermal
inflammation and hyperkeratosis with acanthosis were found at
microscopic examination of the skin (ctfa 1981e).

cosmetic ingredient review

chronic oral toxicity
comparing parabens
matthews et al. (1956) reported a chronic oral toxicity study
in which methylparaben or propylparaben were incorporated
into the diets at 2% or 8% and the diets fed to groups of 24 rats
for 96 weeks. ethylparaben or butylparaben were fed to the
same numbers of rats at concentrations of 2% or 8% in the
diet for 12 weeks. negative controls were included in the study.
rats, especially the males, fed the 8% methylparaben or propylparaben diets had decreased weight gain in the early part of
the study. at 8% dietary concentration, ethylparaben reduced
growth rate, decreased motor activity, and, in some cases, caused
death within the first week. all males fed 8% butylparaben died
before the 12th week. females fed this diet exhibited signs of
toxicity. at 2% of the diet, parabens exerted no toxic effect.
rats killed at the conclusion of the feeding test had no treatment
related abnormalities.
these authors also dosed weanling dogs as follows: six dogs,
1 g/kg/day methylparaben or propylparaben for 378 to 422 days;
and three dogs, 0.5 g/kg/day methylparaben or propylparaben
for 318 to 394 days. two untreated dogs served as a control
group. all dogs were killed for necropsy upon completion of
the feeding. no toxicity to the parabens was observed. all animals were in excellent condition throughout the experiment. all
tissues were normal (matthews et al. 1956).
inai et al. (1985) administered 0.15%, 0.3%, and 0.6% butylparaben or isobutylparaben in the feed of groups of 50 male and
50 female 8-week-old icr/jcl mice for 102 weeks. a group of
50 males and 50 females served as a control and were fed a
basal diet. in a range-finding subacute toxicity test, mice were
fed concentrations of both parabens of 0.6%, 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%,
and 10%. all mice of both sexes in the two highest concentration groups died. significant reductions in weight gain were
seen in the 1.25% and 2.5% groups. the 0.6% level in feed was
determined to be the maximum tolerated dose.
in the chronic toxicity phase of the study, body weights were
measured once a week for the first 6 weeks, once every other
week for the next 24 weeks, and once every 4 weeks for the
remainder of the study. feed consumption was measured once
a week for the first 30 weeks, once every other week for the
next 20 weeks, and once every 4 weeks for the remainder of the
study. animals found moribund during the study were killed and
necropsied. animals surviving to the end of the study were killed
and necropsied. there was no significant difference between
groups in the amount of feed consumed.
data were compiled from animals surviving the study for 78
weeks or more. although tumors were observed in treated and
control animals, there were no significant differences in the incidence of tumors or the time to tumor development between the
treated mice and the controls or between groups given different
doses of isobutylparaben or butylparaben.
tumors in butylparaben-treated mice included thymic lymphoma, nonthymic lymphoid leukemia, and myeloid leukemia;

with adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung and soft tissue
myosarcomas and osteosarcomas in several dose groups.
among isobutylparaben-treated mice, a high incidence of
thymic lymphoma and nonthymic lymphoid leukemia was noted
in the 0.6% group; with soft tissue myosarcomas and osteosarcomas also high. in male mice treated with isobutylparaben, the
most frequently observed neoplasms were lung adenomas and
adenocarcinomas. a high incidence of hematopoietic neoplasms
was found in males in the 0.6% group and in treated females.
there was a low incidence of neoplasms at other sites in females. systemic amyloidosis was noted in 58% of dosed males
and 33% of dosed females compared with 25% of control males
and 10% of control females.
the authors calculated that the maximum ingested dose of
butylparaben that was considered nontumorigenic was ∼40
mg/mouse; equivalent to a daily human intake of 65.8 g. comparing this nontumorigenic level with permitted food additive
levels of 0.25 g/l of butylparaben, they noted that this nontumorigenic level is much higher than the average daily intake of
butylparaben by humans (inai et al. 1985).
although no information is available concerning the incidence of amyloidosis in historical controls in this laboratory,
it has been reported that spontaneous amyloidosis is common
in mice, particularly in some inbred strains and in older mice
(rigdon and schadewald 1972; soret et al. 1977; conner et al.
1983).
multiple parabens
applied research laboratories (1942) fed a 60:40 mixture
of the sodium salts of propylparaben and ethylparaben, respectively, to rats for 18 months. forty rats were given 0.014 g/kg/day.
at 2 and 4 months, 10 rats each were killed for necropsy and collection of tissues for histopathologic examination. at 18 months,
the remaining animals were killed. two groups of 20 rats each
received 0.14 or 1.4 g/kg/day for 18 months and then were killed
for necropsy. the mixture, even when fed at 1.4 g/kg/day did not
induce significant pathologic changes when compared to control
groups. at the highest dose tested, a significant decrease in body
weight gain was observd from months 4 to 8. some evidence of
growth stimulation was observed at the lower doses.
chronic subcutaneous toxicity
methylparaben
mason et al. (1971) administered methylparaben via subcutaneous injection at doses of 3.5, 2.0, 1.1, and 0.6 mg/kg to
groups of 80, 60, 40, and 20 fischer rats, respectively, twice
weekly, for 52 weeks. at 52 weeks, some animals were killed;
others were observed for an additional 6 months and then killed
for necropsy. toxicity was determined by survival time, weight
changes, and drug-related organ changes. when compared to
controls, paraben-treated rats had no significant differences in
mortality, weight gain or lesions.

parabens

dermal irritation
methylparaben
ctfa (1976c) reported that undiluted methylparaben was
tested with the draize skin irritation technique using nine rabbits.
a 0.1-ml sample of the ingredient was applied to the shaved skin
and occluded for 24 h. the resultant primary irritation index (pii)
was 0.67 (maximum score 4.0), a value indicative of mild skin
irritation according to these authors.
ethylparaben
ctfa (1980 h) reported that the draize skin irritation technique was used to test ethylparaben at100% and  xxxd1891xxx % in water
on groups of nine rabbits. the undiluted and diluted ingredient
produced no signs of irritation.
benzylparaben
according to ctfa (1985), the pii of 500 mg of benzylparaben applied under occlusive patches to intact and abraded
skin of six female new zealand rabbits was 0.11 ± 0.08 (control: 0.09 ± 0.09). benzylparaben was neither an irritant nor a
corrosive agent when 0.5 g of the pure ingredient was applied
under semiocclusive conditions to the abraded skin of rabbits.
comparing parabens
sokol (1952) stated that pastes containing hydrophilic ointment and either 10% methylparaben or propylparaben were applied to the shaved backs of albino rabbits for 48 hours produced
no irritation. neither methylparaben, propylparaben, nor their
degradation products were detected when the animals were then
killed and their kidneys removed for analysis.
product dermal irritation tests
methylparaben
several draize rabbit skin irritation tests have been conducted
on product formulations containing parabens (ctfa 1979d,
1979e, 1981g; leberco laboratories 1978c, 1978d, 1979b).
product formulations containing 0.2 to 0.8% methylparaben
produced piis of 0.0 to 1.0 (out of 4.0), values indicative of no to
mild irritation. there was no relation between the concentration
of methylparaben and degree of irritation.
ctfa (1981o) reported that a hairdressing product formulation containing 0.2% methylparaben was tested in a 21-day
dermal irritation study. a volume of 0.5 ml of the undiluted
product was applied topically to the intact and abraded skin of
six albino rabbits once a day for 21 days. twenty-four hours after
each application and prior to the next application, the skin sites
were examined and scored for erythema and edema according to
the draize scale. the abraded sites were reabraded once a week,
and the hair was clipped as needed. the test material initially
produced slight irritation, which increased to mild to moderate
by the end of the first week and remained moderate throughout
the remainder of the study. the authors considered this degree
of irritation to be typical for this type of product.

39

ethylparaben
products containing 0.2% ethylparaben produced minimal to
mild irritation in studies using rabbits, with piis of 0.17 to 0.56
(ctfa 1981h and i).
propylparaben
ctfa (1977b) reported a study in which a product formulation containing 0.3% propylparaben was applied daily to the
shaved skin of nine albino rabbits for 4 consecutive days. the
product produced minimal irritation with a pii of 0.5 (maximum
score 4.0).
butylparaben
ctfa (1976d) reported that a product containing 0.3% butylparaben was similary tested on the backs of six rabbits for 3
consecutive days. almost all rabbits showed mild irritation.
multiple parabens
ctfa (1980c) reported a test in which a product containing
0.2% propylparaben produced minimal irritation in studies using rabbits, with a pii of 0.5. a product containing 0.2% butylparaben was reported to be nonirritating, but the pii of 2.75
indicated moderate irritation. there were no signs of irritation
with a product formulation containing 0.2% propylparaben and
0.1% butylparaben.
ctfa (1979c) reported that a product containing both 0.2%
methylparaben and 0.1% propylparaben was minimally irritating in studies using rabbits, with a pii of 0.5.
dermal sensitization
methylparaben
aldrete and klug (1970) injected methylparaben (0.1%) intradermally into the shaved dorsal skin of four guinea pigs 5
days per week for 8 weeks. sites were scored 24 h after each
injection. results indicated that the frequency as well as the intensity of positive skin reactions decreased slightly with repeated
exposures, suggesting a desensitizing effect.
maurer et al. (1980) injected methylparaben (0.1%) intracutaneously every other day for 3 weeks (10 injections) into
the dorsal skin of each of 20 guinea pigs. sites were scored
24 h postinjection. during the second and third weeks of induction, methylparaben was incorporated at 0.1% in freund’s
complete adjuvant and saline. two weeks after the last induction
injection, a challenge injection was admininstered. the site was
scored at 24 h and compared to induction reactions. ten days
later, a 5% methylparaben challenge patch was applied to the
skin site, which was scored for irritation 24 h later and compared
to controls. three of the 20 guinea pigs reacted to the intradermal challenge, whereas four animals reacted to the challenge
patch. these frequencies were not considered significant when
compared to control values.
ctfa (1981q) also reported that a product formulation containing 0.2% methylparaben was tested for contact sensitization

cosmetic ingredient review

using five male and five female guinea pigs. a dose of 0.5 ml was
administered topically to the shaved backs of the animals and
the application site occluded for 6 h. applications were made
three times per week for a total of nine applications. a challenge application was made on an untreated site 14 days after
the last induction patch. slight irritation was observed during the
induction phase, but no reactions were observed at challenge.
butylparaben
brulos et al. (1977) gave 20 albino guinea pigs intradermal
injections of freund’s complete adjuvant on days 0 and 9, at
which time 5% butylparaben was applied under 48-h occlusive
patches to the clipped dorsal skin every other day for 3 weeks
(10 applications). twelve days after the last induction patch was
removed, the test material was applied as a challenge patch for
48 h to a previously untested site. one, 7, 24, and 48 h after removal of the patch, the sites were scored and the skin examined
microscopically for evidence of sensitization. six of the 20 animals reacted to the challenge patch containing 5% butylparaben
in olive oil. the mean erythema score was 1.70 (maximum score
= 4). tissue from two of the six animals showed “pathologic
aspects” under microscopic examination, and the lesions were
considered clearly allergic. in the worst case, spongiosis, squamous crust, and lymphocytic infiltration were observed.
multiple parabens
sokol (1952) reported that methylparaben, ethylparaben,
propylparaben, and butylparaben (0.1% in saline), was injected
intracutaneously into an unspecified number of guinea pigs,
three times weekly for 3 weeks (10 injections). no reaction was
observed 24 h after the first injection. two weeks following the
last induction injection, a challenge injection was administered
into an adjacent site and observed for 48 h. no allergic response
was induced by any of the parabens.
matthews et al. (1956) reported that the same four parabens
(at 0.1%) were each injected intracutaneously into the shaved
dorsal skin of 10 guinea pigs per ingredient according to the
draize method. injections were made three times weekly for 3
weeks (10 injections). two weeks after the final induction injection, a challenge injection was administered into an adjacent site
and observed 24 h later. there were no reactions in the animals
to any of the parabens. it was observed that these ingredients are
nonsensitizing.
in a procedure described by marzulli et al. (1968), dinitrochlorobenzene (dncb)-hypersensitive guinea pigs were
given intradermal injections or occlusive topical patches of
methylparaben or propylparaben solutions every other day for 3
weeks (10 applications). two weeks after the last induction application, a challenge was administered; reactions to challenge
and induction phases were compared. dncb (0.5 ml) was then
injected intradermally into each animal. two weeks later, 0.5%
and 1.0% dncb were applied to two sites per animal. only the
results of those guinea pigs showing a hypersensitivity to dncb
were used to evaluate paraben hypersensitivity.

none of the 23 dncb-sensitive animals was sensitized to
3% propylparaben by the intradermal route at induction and
both intradermal and topical routes at challenge. none of the
21 dncb-sensitive animals was sensitized to methylparaben
5% intradermally at induction, and 1% intradermally or 10%
topically at challenge (marzulli et al. 1968).
ctfa (1981p) reported that a magnusson-kligman guinea
pig maximization test was used to determine the sensitization
potentials of methylparaben and ethylparaben. the procedure
calls for a protocol of induction with methylparaben or ethylparaben at 1% and 5% in 50% freund’s complete adjuvant,
booster of 10%  xxxd3215xxx  followed by 50% of the
relevant paraben in petrolatum 24 h later, and challenge with
methylparaben at 5% and 10% and ethylparaben at 1% and
2% in petrolatum. a total of 80 female guinea pigs were used.
phenylacetaldehyde (concentration not given) served as a positive control, with 7/8 and 8/8 animals in two groups having
a reaction. no animals in any of the methylparaben or ethylparaben groups showed a reaction.
ocular irritation
methylparaben
simonelli and marri (1939) reported a study in which methylparaben, at concentrations up to 0.2% was instilled into the eyes
of rabbits. at the highest concentration tested, methylparaben
induced slight, transient conjunctival hyperemia.
soehring et al. (1959) reported that, in an investigation concerning the irritancy of various ophthalmic drug ingredients,
0.1% to 0.2% methylparaben in isotonic solution did not induce
ocular irritation when instilled in the eyes of rabbits and guinea
pigs.
ctfa (1976e) reported on a study in which methylparaben
at 100% concentration was instilled into the eyes of six albino
rabbits. the ingredient produced slight transient irritation with
an eye irritation score of 1/110 on day 1.
ethylparaben
ctfa (1980i) reported that ethylparaben at 100% instilled
into the eyes of two groups of six albino rabbits was slightly
irritating, with a maximum eye irritation score of 2/110 on day
1. ethylparaben  xxxd1891xxx % in water produced no signs of irritation.
benzylparaben
ctfa (1985) reported no adverse ocular responses in three
new zealand rabbits at 1, 24, 48, or 72 h after the instillation of
0.1 g of benzylparaben into the conjunctival sac.
multiple parabens
weinreb et al. (1986) reported intercellular vacuolization and
thickening of the endothelial layer in rabbit corneal endothelium
1 day following subconjunctival administration of solutions containing methylparaben and propylparaben.

parabens

product ocular irritation studies
a number of rabbit eye irritation studies have been conducted on products containing methylparaben, ethylparaben,
propylparaben, and/or butylparaben at concentrations of 0.1%
to 0.8%. most products produced no signs of eye irritation
(ctfa 1979c, 1979f, 1979g, 1980h, 1981j, 1981k; leberco laboratories 1978e, 1978f, 1979c). other products produced slight
or minimal eye irritation, with scores of 1.0 to 3.3/110 (ctfa
1980c, 1981l, 1981m, 1981n; stillmeadow 1978b).
mucous membrane irritation
multiple parabens
ctfa (1980c) reported a study in which a product formulation containing 0.2% propylparaben and 0.1% butylparaben
was applied to the genital mucosa of six female albino rabbits.
the single 0.1-ml application of the undiluted product produced
no evidence of mucosal irritation during the 7-day observation
period.
phototoxicity
multiple parabens
as noted earlier, ctfa (1981e) reported a 3-month dermal
toxicity study of a product formulation containing 0.2% methylparaben and 0.2% propylparaben using rabbits. the formulation
was administered at doses of 2 mg/cm2 /10% body surface area
and 6 mg/cm2 /10% body surface area. after dosing, rabbits in
one control group and one group treated with 6 mg/cm2 of the
product were exposed daily to one-half the minimal erythema
dose of ultraviolet light (4 min at 6 inches from westinghouse
fs-20 lamps, producing a continuous spectrum from 2800 to
4000 a). the product caused persistent moderate erythema,
slight edema, and mild desquamation. epidermal fissures with
bleeding and papuloerythema were observed occasionally. the
high dose was slightly more irritating than the low dose. ultraviolet light exposure had no apparent effect on the severity of
the irritation in either treatment group.
genotoxicity
methylparaben
litton bionetics (1974) reported the result of 3 different
assays to evaluate the genotoxicity of methylparaben: a hostmediated assay, a cytogenic assay, and a dominant lethal assay.
the host-mediated assay consisted of three parts, an acute
in vivo test, a subchronic in vivo test, and an in vitro study. in
the acute in vivo host-mediated assay, 0 to 5000 mg/kg methylparaben was administered orally to each of 10 mice. positive and
negative controls were used. animals then received intraperitoneally 2 ml salmonella typhimurium strain ta1530 and 2 ml
saccharomyces cerevisiae strain d-3 indicator organisms. animals were killed 3 h later, and peritoneal fluid was extracted,
bacterial counts were made, and the number of mutants was
recorded. in the subchronic in vivo host-mediated assay, each of

41

10 mice received orally 0 to 3500 mg/kg methylparaben daily
for 5 consecutive days. within 30 min after the last treatment,
animals were inoculated with indicator organisms and treated
as above. in the in vitro host-mediated assay, 0 to 100 µg/ml
methylparaben were added to plates containing the indicator organisms. after incubation, the number of mutants was recorded.
methylparaben induced no significant increases in mutant or
recombinant frequencies with salmonella typhimurium or saccharomyces cerevisiae in these in vitro or in vivo host-mediated
assays.
the cytogenic assay also consisted of acute and subchronic
in vivo tests and an in vitro study. in the acute cytogenic assay,
groups of 15 rats were given 5 to 5000 mg/kg methylparaben
by gastric intubation. four hours later, each animal received intraperitoneally 4 mg/kg  xxxd1831xxx  to arrest bone marrow cells in
mitosis. five animals at each dose level were killed at 6, 24, and
48 h. bone marrow was removed and the chromosomes of cells
evaluated for abnormalities. positive and negative controls were
used. in the subchronic cytogenic assay, groups of five mice received 0 to 5000 mg/kg methylparaben daily for 5 consecutive
days. animals were killed 6 h following the last dosing, and tissue was taken for evaluation as above. in the in vitro cytogenic
assay, 1 to 100 µg/ml methylparaben were added to cultures of
human embryonic lung cells in anaphase. positive and negative
controls were used. chromosomal damage was then evaluated.
methylparaben induced no detectable aberrations in the chromosomes of the rat bone marrow cells in metaphase and induced no
significant aberration in the anaphase chromosomes of human
lung cells in culture. the investigators noted that fewer mitoses
were observed in the bone marrow cells of animals treated with
5000 mg/kg/day for 5 days. they suggested that methylparaben
may interfere with mitosis when administered subchronically at
high dosages.
in the dominant lethal assay, groups of 10 male rats received
orally 0 to 5000 mg/kg methylparaben once (acute study) or
daily for 5 consecutive days (subchronic study). positive and
negative controls were used. following treatment, males were
mated with two virgin females per week for 7 or 8 weeks.
pregnant females were killed 14 days after separation from
treated males, and uteri were examined for deciduomata, late
fetal deaths, and total implantations. no dose-response or timetrend patterns that would suggest a dominant lethal effect for
methylparaben were observed. methylparaben was nonmutagenic under the conditions of the study (litton bionetics 1974).
matsuoka et al. (1979) studied the potential of methylparaben
to induce chromosomal aberrations in chinese hamster lung
cells in vitro. cells were treated with 0.125 mg/ml methylparaben in the presence and absence of polychlorinated biphenyl
(pcb)-induced rat hepatic cell homogenates (s9 mix). chromosome preparations were then made and aberrations were
scored. when assayed without s9 mix, induction of chromosomal aberrations was negative (1%). in the presence of s9
mix, however, aberration incidence increased to 13.0% and
was judged to be significant. gaps, breaks, exchanges, and

42

cosmetic ingredient review

rings were observed. the significance of these effects was not
assessed.
propylparaben
mccann et al. (1975) reported the use of the salmonella
/microsome test to study the mutagenic potential of propylparaben. s. typhimurium strains ta100, ta98, ta1535, and
ta1537 were used. assays were performed with and without
aroclor 1254–induced rat liver microsomal enzymes (s9). when
tested at doses of 10 to 2000 µg/plate, propylparaben was nonmutagenic both with and without metabolic activation.
litton bionetics (1975) also used the ames test to evaluate the mutagenic potential of propylparaben in s. cerevisiae
strain d-4 and in s. typhimurium strains ta1535, ta1537, and
ta1538. assays were performed in the presence and absence
of mouse, rat, and monkey liver, lung, and testes homogenates.
in plate tests, 0.075% propylparaben was added to cultures. in
suspension tests, 0.025% to 0.15% propylparaben was used.
propylparaben was nonmutagenic with and without metabolic
activation in all assays.
odashima (1976) reported that propylparaben was evaluated
in an in vivo cytogenic assay, an ames or modified ames test,
and a bacterial repair test. in the cytogenic assay, mice were
given one minimum lethal dose of propylparaben and killed 6 to
48 h later. bone marrow cell chromosomes were examined for
aberrations. mutagenic activity was evaluated in s. typhimurium
strains ta1535, ta1536, ta1537, and ta1538, and repair testing was performed with e. coli strains h-17, m-45, and wp-2.
in all assays except the repair test, propylparaben was nongenotoxic.
sugimura et al. (1976) used a modified ames test in which
propylparaben in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) was added to cultures of s. typhimurium strains ta100 and ta98, as well as
e. coli strain d-2. assays were performed in the presence and
absence of pcb-induced rat liver microsomal enzymes. propylparaben was nonmutagenic in all strains without metabolic activation and in strains ta98 and d-2 with metabolic activation,
but was mutagenic in strain ta100 with metabolic activation.
isopropylparaben
ishidate and odashima (1977) reported that, at a concentration of 1 mg/plate in dmso, isopropylparaben was negative in
ames tests using s. typhimurium strains ta92, ta1535, ta100,
ta1537, ta94, and ta98, with and without metabolic activation.
butylparaben
ishizaki et al. (1978) reported that when butylparaben (1%) is
combined with potassium nitrate or sodium nitrite and irradiated
for 5 days, butyl 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzoate is formed. this reaction product was found to be mutagenic in a “rec-assay” with
b. subtilis. when tested in the same mutagenic assay, butylparaben alone was nonmutagenic.

isobutylparaben
ishidate and odashima (1977) reported that at a concentration of 1 mg/plate in dmso isobutylparaben was negative in
ames tests using s. typhimurium strains ta92, ta1535, ta100,
ta1537, ta94, and ta98. these authors also performed a chromosomal abberation assay using a chinese hamster fibroblast
cell line. cells treated with 0.03% isobutylparaben in ethanol
(dose volume equal to 1.0% of total volume) had no chromosomal aberrations after 48 h.
odashima (1980) reported that isobutylparaben was positive
in a chromosomal aberration assay but negative in an ames test
and a rec assay (details not available).
comparing parabens
ishidate et al. (1978) studied the ability of methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben to induce chromosomal aberrations in chinese hamster cells in vitro. each
paraben at different doses was applied directly to cells; chromosome preparations were made 24 to 48 h later and aberrations scored. the maximum tolerated concentrations for methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben were
0.50, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.06 mg/ml, respectively. all esters except methylparaben induced 1% to 3% increases in polyploid
cell production. frequency increased as the paraben alkyl chain
length increased. of the four parabens tested, ethylparaben and
methylparaben were judged to induce significant chromosomal
aberrations (11.0% and 15.0% increases, respectively). aberrations observed included chromatid breaks, chromatid gaps,
chromosomal exchanges, and ring formations.
ishidate et al. (1984) summarized the results of mutagenicity screening of food additives, including ethylparaben, isopropylparaben, and isobutylparaben. results of reverse mutation assays using s. typhimurium strains ta92, ta1535, ta100,
ta1537, ta94, and ta98 (ames test) were considered negative
(<4.9% mutation frequency) for all three parabens. in chromosomal aberration assays using a chinese hamster fibroblast cell
line, after 48 h, cells treated with 0.25 mg/ml ethylparaben,
0.125 mg/ml isopropylparaben, or 0.6 mg/ml isobutylparaben
in ethanol had 1%, 2.0%, and 3.0% polyploid cells and a 11%,
1%, and 1% incidence of structural chromosomal aberrations,
respectively. the authors stated that the control incidence of
aberrations was usually less than 3% and that any result less
than 4% was considered negative. a result more than 10% was
positive.
carcinogenesis
cell proliferation
methylparaben
homburger (1968) reported on a study in which 100 male
c57bl/6 mice were given 2.5 mg methylparaben (in tricaprylin)
injected subcutaneously into the groin. five weeks later, injection site skin was excised, minced, and pooled. the resulting mix

parabens

was injected subcutaneously into each of 25 c57bl/6 males.
eighteen weeks later, animals were killed and examined microscopically for evidence of tumors. throughout the study, positive and negative controls were used. six of the 25 test animals
died by the 8th week. by the 10th week, 12 animals had died.
cause of death was not determined. at the injection sites, multiple granulomas with numerous giant cells scattered throughout
the tissue were observed. scar tissue and numerous cysts were
present. there were no instances where fibroblasts in granulation
or scar tissue suggested malignant transformation. the author
stated that methylparaben was not carcinogenic under these test
conditions.
in a second study, 2.5 mg methylparaben were injected as a
single dose into the tail vein of each of 50 cf-1 strain a and
50 a/jax female mice. an additional 20 cf-1 female mice received intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 mg methylparaben daily
for 7 months. positive and negative controls were used. all mice
were killed  xxxd2274xxx  months, and the lungs were examined for the
presence of tumors. methylparaben did not significantly increase
pulmonary adenoma formation as compared to controls.
in a cocarcinogenesis study, each of 50 c57bl/6 male mice
were given 12.5 µg dibenzo[a,i]pyrene (dbp) in tricaprylin injected subcutaneously. twenty-four hours later, 2.5 mg methylparaben was injected in the same site. additional injections of
methylparaben were made 7 and 14 days later. positive and
negative controls were included. all animals were killed at 29
to 31 weeks. sites were examined microscopically for tumors.
methylparaben was not cocarcinogenic. however, because the
positive-control compound (croton oil) had no effect, the author
stated that the test was inconclusive (homburger 1968).
mason et al. (1971) conducted a study in which weanling fischer rats were placed into groups (equal males and females) of
80, 60, 40, and 20 animals and given subcutaneous injections of
3.5, 2.0, 1.1 and 0.6 mg/kg methylparaben, respectively, twice
weekly for 52 weeks. positive, negative, and vehicle controls
were used. all animals were necropsied after they died or were
killed for necropsy 26 weeks posttreatment. of all tumors observed in methylparaben-treated rats, only mammary fibroadenoma incidence was significantly higher than negative control
groups (8% incidence for methylparaben; 1% for negative control). the incidence of injection site tumors, pituitary adenomas,
uterine polyps, and leukemias did not differ significantly from
controls.
rodrigues et al. (1986) fed methylparaben to weanling fischer 344 rats (eight animals). analyses of the rat stomach were
performed as in the study by hirose et al. (1986). the authors reported no increase in the labeling index in the prefundic region.
because this finding was different from earlier results demonstrating an increase in the labeling index with propylparaben
treatment, these authors conducted a further study comparing
p-hydroxybenzoic acid, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben as described under “comparing
parabens” in this section.

43

propylparaben
odashima (1976) stated that propylparaben was evaluated for
carcinogenicity with a transplacental assay and a newborn assay.
in the former, pregnant rodents were given orally the maximum
dose not causing abortion or early death of neonates. animals
were treated every other day for 5 days during the days 15 to 19
of gestation. sucklings were observed for 1 year after birth for
tumor development. in the newborn study, four subcutaneous
injections of propylparaben (total dose = ld20 ) were administered to rodent pups on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 following birth.
sucklings were observed for 1 year after birth for tumor development. the author stated that, in both studies, propylparaben
was noncarcinogenic.
in a study primarily examining the pathological and proliferative effects of butylated hydroxyanisole (bha), nera et al.
(1984) reported the short-term effects of propylparaben in the
forestomach of fischer 344 rats. finely ground propylparaben
at 1.0% and 4.0% (five rats each group) was incorporated in
powdered rat diet of weanling rats and given for 9 days. untreated diet was the negative control. one hour before killing
with co2 , each rat was injected intraperioneally (i.p.) with 0.25
µci/g [methyl-3 h] thymidine. each rat was necropsied and the
stomach removed and processed for autoradiography using a
longitudinal bisection of the entire stomach, and different parts
of the stomach were taken for histological examination.
results for propylparaben were presented by comparison
with the effects of bha. at 1% propylparaben, a 1.5-fold increase in the labeling index was found in the prefundic region,
with hyperplasia seen histologically. at 4% propylparaben, there
was a 2.5- fold increase in the labeling index in the prefundic
region, with rete pegs and papillae, slight acanthosis, and minimal hyperkeratosis seen with intercellular edema. these findings
were comparable to 0.5% bha in the powdered diet (nera et al.
1984).
hirose et al. (1986) compared the effects of 13 phenolic compounds, including propylparaben, using syrian golden hamsters.
each of 15 7-week old hamsters received 3% propylparaben in
feed for 20 weeks. a control group received only basal feed.
at the end of the exposure, animals were killed and their liver,
kidneys, cheek pouch, stomach, esophagus, lungs, pancreas, and
urinary bladder were removed.
three animals received an intraperitoneal injection of
[methyl-3 h]thymidine 1 h before killing. tissue for histological
and autoradiographic examination was taken from the anterior
and posterior walls of the forestomach, glandular stomach, and
urinary bladder. mild hyperplasia in the forestomach was seen
in five animals, but no moderate or severe hyperplasia or papillomatous lesions were found. radiolabel indicies were not
different compared to controls.
shibata et al. (1990) reported on the early proliferative responses of forestomach and glandular stomach of rats treated
with five different phenolic antioxidants, including propylparaben. five 6-week-old rats were given 3% propylparaben in

44

cosmetic ingredient review

feed for 8 weeks. a control group received basal feed. at week
8, rats were injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine
(brdu) and killed 1 h later. stomachs were removed and fixed.
samples for histological examination and brdu immunohistochemical staining were taken from the forestomach and the glandular stomach. propylparaben had no hyperplastic effect and
there was no increase in the labeling index in the forestomach.
likewise, propylparaben had no effect on the glandular stomach.
comparing parabens
as described in “chronic toxicity” earlier, inai et al. (1985)
examined the tumorigenicity of butylparaben or isobutylparaben administered orally to mice. there were no statistically
significant differences in the tumor incidence between control
and treated mice, or between groups of treated mice. the incidence and time to death with neoplasms in different organs also
was not different between control and treated mice. the authors
reported a higher incidence of amyloidosis in treated animals,
with effects in the spleen, liver, kidney, and/or adrenal gland,
compared to controls.
rodrigues et al. (1986) conducted a study using phydroxybenzoic acid, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben using the methods of hirose et al.
(1986). treatment chemicals were given to fischer 344 male
rats at 4% for 9 days in the dry diet. bha at 2% was the positive
control.
no effect was seen in the prefundic region in control animals
or in animals fed 4% p-hydroxybenzoic acid or methylparaben.
around a 2-fold increase in labeling index was seen for 4%
ethylparaben, an 8-fold increase for propylparaben, and almost
a 14-fold increase for 4% butylparaben. bha at 2% produced
an increase in labeling index similar to 4% butylparaben.
the authors stated their view that the finding of labeling index
related to the chain length of the paraben used in the study probably reflects the inability of esterases present in the forestomach
epithelium to hydrolyze parabens with higher chain lengths (rodrigues et al. 1986).
reproductive and developmental toxicity
teratogenesis
methylparaben
the food and drug research labs (1972) studied the teratogenic effects of methylparaben in rats, mice, and hamsters.
groups of 21 to 25 pregnant animals were given methylparaben
orally at doses of 5.0 to 550 mg/kg (rats, mice) or 3.0 to 300
mg/kg (hamsters) from day 6 of gestation to day 10 (hamsters)
or 15 (rats, mice). positive and negative controls were used. animals were observed for signs of toxicity, and body weights were
monitored. on gestation day 14 (hamsters), 17 (mice), or 20
(rats), all females were subjected to caesarean section. numbers
of implantation sites, resorption sites, live and dead fetuses, and
body weights of live pups were recorded. urogenital tracts of
females were examined for abnormalities. all fetuses were ex-

amined for visceral, skeletal, and external abnormalities. oral
administration of up to 300 mg/kg methylparaben for 5 consecutive days in hamsters or up to 550 mg/kg for 10 consecutive
days in rats and mice had no effect on nidation or on maternal
or fetal survival. the number of visceral, skeletal, and external
abnormalities observed in the test group fetuses did not differ
significantly from that of control groups.
a similar study (food and drug research labs 1973) was
performed on groups of 9 to 11 pregnant rabbits given orally
3.0 to 300 mg/kg methylparaben daily from day 6 of gestation
to day 18. positive and negative controls were used. test animals and fetuses were examined as above. results indicated
that ingestion of up to 300 mg/kg methylparaben for 13 consecutive days during gestation had no effect on nidation or maternal
or fetal survival. the number of visceral, skeletal, and external
abnormalities observed in the test group fetuses did not differ
significantly from control groups.
ethylparaben
moriyama et al. (1975) added ethylparaben to the feed of
groups of 12 pregnant rats at concentrations of 0.1%, 1%, or
10% between gestation days 8 and 15. on day 21 of pregnancy,
rats were killed, and the number of fetal implantations, status
of maternal visceral organs, fetal body weights, and numbers of
skeletal, visceral, and external defects in fetuses were recorded.
at the 10% level, cerebral hemorrhages, abnormal enlargement in the ventricles of the brain, and, in some, hydronephrosis
and hypo-osteogenesis were observed in fetuses. some fetuses at
1% ethylparaben had no blood in the cardiac ventricle; some had
intraperitoneal hemorrhages. fetuses of rats of the 0.1% group
had no significant visceral or skeletal defects. the authors considered the incidence of visceral and skeletal abnormalities in
the 363 test fetuses evaluated to be insignificant when compared
to control animals.
in addition, two groups of six pregnant rats each were given
0.1% or 10% ethylparaben administered in their feed for 1 week
during gestation days 8 to 15. neonates from these dams were
nursed for 1 month and growth, body weights, and abnormalities
were recorded. these neonates grew normally. none had malformations or abnormal behavior. the authors concluded that
at concentrations up to 10%, ethylparaben was not teratogenic
(moriyama et al. 1975).
butylparaben
daston (2004) conducted a feeding study to determine the
developmental toxicity of butylparaben in rats. singly housed
sprague-dawley rats were divided into three treatment groups
and one control group—each group consisted of 25 presumed
pregnant rats. dose levels in the three treatment groups were 10,
100, and 1000 mg/kg day−1 daily on gestational days (gds) 6 to
19. based on range-finding studies, the 10 and 100 mg/kg day−1
groups were expected to be the same as the control group.
body weights and clinical signs were determined daily, but
feed consumption was recorded only on gds 0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18

parabens

and at sacrifice (by co2 inhalation) on gd 20. fetuses were obtained by caesarean section. uteri were stained and examined for
implantation sites. the number and distribution of corpora lutea,
implantation sites, live and dead fetuses, and early (embryonic
structures not evident) and late resorptions were recorded. fetal observations included sex, external abnormalities, and body
weights. live fetuses were sacrificed by i.p. injection of a commercial euthanasia solution. around half of the fetuses were
examined for soft tissue abnormalities and the other half examined for skeletal abnormalities.
in the high-dose group, maternal body weight gains were reduced compared to controls, reaching statistical significance at
gds 18 to 20. maternal feed consumption values were significantly reduced in the high-dose group on gds 12 to 15 and 18 to
20 compared to controls. even with some maternal toxicity, the
author concluded that none of the measures of developmental
toxicity were affected by any of the butylparaben doses.
the author noted that this study protocol measures parameters that are influenced by a large number of developmental
mechanisms that may be sensitive to toxicants, including estrogens. although these parameters are not the most sensitive
indicators of estrogenic activity, the author indicated that this
study design is responsive to such agents. the author concluded
that butylparaben at these dose levels does not have strong estrogenic potential during development, consistent with other observations of weak in vitro estrogenicity and limited response in the
in vivo uterotrophic assay. the findings are not consistent, the
author stated, with the findings of oishi (2001, 2002a). given
that butylparaben is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to phydroxybenzoic acid by esterases throughout the body and that
p-hydroxybenzoic acid has no estrogenic activity (routledge et
al. 1998), the author suggested that this is a plausible explanation
for the absence of butylparaben developmental toxicity (daston
2004).
harvey (2005) provided commentary on the above study.
this author noted that the lemini et al. (1997) study of phydroxybenzoic acid injected subcutaneously did demonstrate
a uterotrophic effect and further argued that parabens may be
absorbed intact. this author’s suggestion is for a complete evaluation of the reproductive toxicity of parabens using accepted
protocols.
daston (2005) responded to this by reiterating that by relevant
exposure routes, butylparaben does not appear to have significant estrogenic effect when administered orally or applied to
the skin. noting that oral administration data in reports by oishi
(2001, 2002a) are the exception to this statement, this author
suggests the need to replicate this study.
male reproductive effects
methylparaben
charles river discovery and development services (2005a)
conducted a study using crl:(wi) br male rats. four exposure
groups (16 rats each) received butylparaben at concentrations

45

of 0, 100, 1000, and 10000 ppm in the diet for a minimum of 56
days. diet was prepared by combining butylparaben in acetone
with the meal form of ce-2 diet. the authors reported that the
acetone evaporated. mean values for actual consumed doses of
butylparaben were estimated to be 0, 11.2, 110.0, and 1141.1
mg/kg day−1 .
all rats were 21 days of age at the start of the study.
body weights, clinical observations, and feed consumption were
recorded. at 21 days after the start of exposure (42 days of
age), blood samples were collected (biweekly after the initial
collection) and analyzed for luteinizing hormone (lh), folliclestimulating hormone (fsh), and testosterone. animals were observed for viability at least 2× daily and examined for clinical
signs and general appearance at least 1× daily. at the end of
the study, all surviving rats were killed and a final blood sample
taken and analyzed. sperm evaluations (concentration, motility,
and morphology) were made. the left testis from each animal
was collected for evaluation of daily sperm production (dsp).
a gross necropsy was performed and reproductive organs,
livers, adrenal glands, thyroid glands, and pituitary glands were
weighed and prepared for histological evaluation. histological
examination of the reproductive organs was performed on animals from the control and high-dose groups, including 25 crosssections of seminiferous tubules from each animal grouped into
each of six stages of spermatid development.
urine-stained abdominal fur was observed in three rats in
the highest dose group. no other dose-related effects of methylparaben consumption on body weights, weight gain, feed consumption, organ weights, daily sperm production, or sperm morphology were found in any dose group. one rat in the highest
dose group was found dead on day 31, but no cause of death
could be determined. this death was not considered related to
treatment because the rat was normal in all aspects until being
found dead. histopathology of the testes using the semiquantitative staging identified no cell or stage related changes in either
control or treated animals (charles river discovery and development services 2005a).
propylparaben
oishi (2002b) reported the effects of propylparaben on the
male reproductive system in rats. crj:wistar rats, 19 to 21 days
old (52.5 ± 2.17 g) were placed into four groups of eight animals
each. propylparaben was given in the diet at 0%, 0.01%, 0.10%,
and 1.0%. at the end of 4 weeks, rats were killed by decapitation,
reproductive organs were examined, sperm counts performed in
the testis, sperm reserves determined in the cauda epididymides,
and testosterone levels were measured. intake of the test material
calculated from the amount of food consumed resulted in values
of 12.4 ± 3.04, 125 ± 30.0, and 1290 ± 283 mg/kg day−1 for
the 0.01%, 0.10%, and 1.0% groups, respectively.
food intake was not different in any group, nor were there
any significant body weight differences. a significant reduction
in cauda epididymal sperm reserves and sperm concentrations
was seen at 0.1% and 1.0% (compared to controls), but it was

46

cosmetic ingredient review

not determined if the two levels were different from each other.
sperm counts in the testis of rats exposed to propylparaben were
37.5 ± 5.32, 26.2 ± 2.34, 27.0 ± 9.07, and 25.9 ± 3.90 (dsp ×
106 ± sd) for the 0%, 0.01%, 0.1%, and 1.0% groups, respectively. the sperm counts at all treatment levels were statistically
different from controls. serum testosterone was said to be reduced in a dose-dependent manner, but only the 1.0% level was
significantly reduced compared to controls (oishi 2002b).
ashby et al. (2003) reviewed available data on control sperm
counts from their own and several other studies using wistar
rats. control sperm counts in the testis from different reported
studies were given as 12.5 ± 1.2, 18.8 ± 2.7, 25.5 ± 4.4, 27.2
± 3.4, 27.5 ± 3.2, and 34.4 ± 4.3 (dsp × 106 ± sd). these
values encompass the values reported by oishi (2002b).
butylparaben
fisher et al. (1999) studied the effect of subcutaneous injections of estrogen and other compounds on the development
of the efferent ducts of the rat testis through puberty to adulthood. the efferent ducts join the testis to the initial segment of
the epididymis and are comprised of a ciliated and nonciliated
epithelium that express estrogen receptors alpha and beta. although
the primary focus of the study was on diethylstilbestrol (des)
compared to  xxxd2054xxx  and tamoxifen, they also examined butylparaben (at ∼2 mg/kg day−1 in corn oil on postnatal
days 2 to 18). animals exposed to butylparaben were killed on
postnatal day 18, so that time became a point of comparison
across all treatments. at postnatal day 19, des produced doserelated changes in all parameters measured, but butylparaben
produced only minor effects on one parameter, epithelial cell
height. no effect of butylparaben on the expression of the water
channel protein aquaphorin-1, efferent duct distension, or rete
testis morphology was seen.
oishi (2001) reported on the effects of butylparaben on the
male reproductive system in rats. butylparaben was given in
feed at doses of 0.01%, 0.10%, and 1.0% (8 rats per dose) to
3-week-old male wistar rats for 8 weeks. a control group received basal diet only. the average butylparaben intake from
calculated food consumption was 10.4 ± 3.07, 103 ± 31.2,
and 1026 ± 310 mg/kg day−1 for the 0.01%, 0.10%, and 1.0%
dose groups, respectively. animals were killed and reproductive
organs dissected and weighed. sperm counts were performed.
serum testosterone levels were measured after  xxxd2052xxx  extraction using an enzyme immunoassay kit.
body weights were not affected by butylparaben, but there
was a decrease in epididymis and seminal vesicles weights at
the 1.0% dose level, and a decrease in the relative weights of the
epididymis at both the 0.1% and 1.0% dose levels. there were
no effects on the testes, ventral prostates, or preputial glands.
sperm counts at all dose levels were significantly decreased
compared to controls, with a dose-dependent decreasing trend.
serum testosterone was significantly decreased at the 0.1% and
1.0% dose levels, but it was not determined if the effect at the
two dose levels were different from each other. the author con-

cluded that butylparaben can adversely affect the secretion of
testosterone and alter the functions of the male reproductive system. recalling that sperm counts were reduced at 0.01% (∼10
mg/kg) butylparaben, the author went on to compare this with
the acceptable daily intake (adi) levels set by the european
commission (10 mg/kg), japan (10 mg/kg), and the average
daily intake in the united states (1 to 16 mg/kg for infants and
4 to 6 mg/kg after 2 years of age) and suggest that an adverse
effect of butylparaben is possible at doses well below the adi
or average daily intake (oishi 2001).
kang et al. (2002) reported decreased sperm number and
motile activity in f1 offspring of rats maternally exposed to
butylparaben. female sprague-dawley rats (22 9-week-old animals) were mated with male sprague-dawley rats. after mating,
animals were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups
(six to eight animals per group). treatment groups received 100
or 200 mg/kg day−1 butylparaben (in dmso) by subcutaneous
injection. the total treatment period was from gestation day
6 to postnatal day 20, with a 2-day interruption at parturition.
dams were killed when their litters were weaned, and body and
organ weights measured. implantation sites were determined.
live pups were counted, weighed, examined, and anatomical
measurements made. pups were killed and examined at postnatal days 21, 49, 70, and 90. body and organ weights were
measured and gross morphology of internal and external genitalia was examined. histopathology was performed on the testes,
prostate glands, seminal vesicles, uteri, and ovaries. sperm in
the caudal epididymides were counted and sperm motility determined. spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules was examined. rna was extracted from the testes of three male offspring of each group to determine expression of  xxxg730xxx  mrna.
there were no signs of toxicity in treated dams. implantation
sites, total pups, and pup sex ratio were not affected by treatment. the proportion of live pups, however, was decreased at
both butylparaben doses and the proportion of pups surviving to
weaning was decreased in the high-dose group. effects in male
f1 offspring varied as a function of postnatal time and dose level,
but no apparent pattern emerged; e.g., decreased body weights
on postnatal day 49 in the low-dose group, but not in the highdose group. no abnormalities were reported from the histopathological examination of the reproductive organs of male f1
animals.
the number of sperm in the caudal epididymis was 50% of
control levels, sperm motility was reduced, and the numbers
of round and elongated spermatid cells was decreased at both
doses. the pattern of expression of  xxxg730xxx  mrna
appeared to be affected, but at both doses only on postnatal
days 21 (decrease) and 70 (increase). at postnatal day 49, the
expression was decreased only at the low dose, and at postnatal
day 90, the expression was increased only at the high dose. the
authors suggested that maternal exposure to these high doses of
butylparaben delayed late stage of spermatogenesis by affecting
the hormonal regulation process (kang et al. 2002).

47

parabens

oishi (2002a) reported the effects of butylparaben on the
male reproductive system in mice. using the same protocol described by this author above for rats, 4-week-old crj:cd-1 mice
were treated in groups of eight to butylparaben in the diet for 10
weeks. butylparaben doses calculated from food consumption
were 14.4 ± 3.60, 146 ± 35.9, and 1504 ± 357 mg/kg day−1 .
there were no treatment-related effects on the liver, ventral
prostates, seminal vesicles, and preputial glands. both the absolute and relative epididymis weights were significantly higher in
the high-dose group, compared to controls. a dose-dependent
decrease in round and elongated spermatid counts was found,
although the numbers of spermatogonia and spermatocytes did
not differ from controls. serum testosterone was significantly
decreased only at the high dose, but a dose-dependent trend was
noted. comparing the doses in the study to the adi in japan,
the author noted that butylparaben can have adverse effects on
the male reproductive system at doses below the adi.
charles river discovery and development services (2005b)
conducted a study using crl:(wi) br male rats. four exposure
groups (16 rats each) received butylparaben at concentrations
of 0, 100, 1000, and 10000 ppm in the diet for a minimum of 56
days. diet was prepared by combining butylparaben in acetone
with the meal form of ce-2 diet. the authors reported that the
acetone evaporates and is not a permanent part of the diet mixture. the authors noted the difficulty in preparing butylparaben
for the 10000 ppm group because of solubility problems. these
were overcome by adding small increments of butylparaben
and small incremental additions of acetone, etc., until the desired solution concentration was reached. actual consumed
doses of butylparaben were estimated to be 0, 10.9, 109.3, and
1087.6 mg/kg day−1 .
all rats were 21 days of age at the start of the study.
body weights, clinical observations, and feed consumption were
recorded. at 21 days after the start of exposure (42 days of age),
blood samples were collected (bi-weekly after the initial collection) and analyzed for lh, fsh, and testosterone.
at the end of the study, all surviving rats were killed and a
final blood sample taken and analyzed. sperm evaluations (concentration, motility, and morphology) were made. one testis was
collected for evaluation of dsp.
a gross necropsy was performed and reproductive organs,
livers, adrenal glands, thyroid glands, and pituitary glands were
weighed and prepared for histological evaluation. the authors
noted that the histological examination of the testes was done in
such a manner to identify treatment related effects such as missing germ cell layers or types, retained spermatids, multinucleate
or apoptotic germ cells, and sloughing of spermatogenic cells
into the lumen. cross-sections (25) of seminiferous tubules were
evaluated from each animal and grouped into one of six staging
groups. in this way, the authors stated, cell or stage specificity
of testicular findings could be noted.
no effects of butylparaben consumption on body weights,
weight gain, feed consumption, or organ weights were found.
two rats (one control and one in the 100 ppm group) were killed

on days 32 and 44, respectively, because of lesions of the eye
from retro-orbital bleeding. in those two animals, no other clinical observations were noted during the study or at necropsy. no
other control or treatment animals had adverse clinical observations during the study or at necropsy.
histopathology of the testes using the semiquantitative staging described above identified no cell or stage related changes in
either control or treated animals, except that one rat given 10,000
ppm had a single cross-section (25 cross-sections obtained) of
a seminiferous tubule with a loss of germinal epithelium. the
authors interpreted the small area affected and the failure to
find any equivalent findings in the testes of any other animal to
suggest this effect was not treatment related. histopathological
evaluation of the adrenal, pituitary, or thyroid glands or the liver
uncovered no treatment related effects.
dsp was unaffected by butylparaben consumption. likewise, no effect on sperm motility, count, or morphology was
found. no consistent differences in lh, fsh, or testosterone
levels were reported in the treatment groups compared to controls. in the 1000 and 10,000 ppm groups at the second blood
sample interval (3 weeks), there was a significant reduction in
testosterone. at 9 weeks, the 10,000 ppm group had an increased
testosterone level. lh levels were reduced in the 100 and 10,000
ppm groups at 5 weeks, but not at other doses. at 9 weeks,
lh levels were increased in the 10,000 ppm group. none of
these findings were considered dose-related. these authors concluded that 10,000 ppm was a no observed effect level (noel)
for general toxicity, including specific male reproductive toxicity as determined by hormone level determinations and sperm
analysis (charles river discovery and development services
2005b).
comparing parabens
song et al. (1989) reported the effects of methyl-, ethyl-,
propyl-, and butylparaben on human spermatozoa in a study
designed to screen for potential spermicidal agents. semen was
obtained from healthy donors and accepted only if the sperm
density was not less than 50 × 106 /ml and at least 40% to 50%
fully motile with rapid forward motion. semen (0.2 ml) was
mixed with 1.0 ml of parabens by shaking for 10 s at the concentrations shown in table 21. if immediate viewing showed
signs of sperm viability, the sample was incubated for 30 to 60
min and reexamined.

cosmetic ingredient review

the lowest concentration at which none of the spermatazoa
showed any signs of viability was reported for each paraben
as follows: methylparaben, 6.0 mg/ml; ethylparaben, 8 mg/ml;
propylparaben, 3 mg/ml; and butylparaben, 1.0 mg/ml. because 6.0 mg/ml was the lowest concentration of methylparaben
tested, the authors suggested that it may be that total inactivation
could occur at a lower concentration (song et al. 1989).
oishi (2004) reported an absence of spermatotoxic effects in
male crj:wistar rats fed 0.1 and 1.0% methylparaben or ethylparaben. test compounds were administered in the diet of 25-to
27-day-old rats (75.9 ± 2.87 g). animals were divided into five
groups of eight each. one group served as controls, and the other
four were given one of the two test parabens at one of the two
concentrations. at the end of 8 weeks, the rats were weighed
and then decapitated. the weights of the testes, epididymides,
prostates, seminal vesicles, and preputial glands were measured.
sperm counts in the testes and epididymides were made. sperm
cell stages were determined in a sectional analysis of each rat
testis. the concentrations of testosterone, lh, and fsh in serum
were measured.
the paraben intakes for the 0.1% and 1.0% diet groups were
approximately 100 and 1000 mg/kg day−1 , respectively. compared to controls, no statistically significant differences were
found in any of the organ weights or the total body weights,
sperm counts were not different, the distribution pattern of sperm
developmental stages was not altered, and the serum levels of
the hormones tested were not different. the author contrasted
these findings with the adverse effects on sperm seen with orally
administered butylparaben and propylparaben (oishi 2004).
uterotrophic assays
p-hydroxybenzoic acid
lemini et al. (1997) reported on the estrogenic effects of phydroxybenzoic acid in immature cd-1 mice and in ovariectomized cd-1 female mice. subcutaneous injection of phydroxybenzoic acid was made at 5, 50, 500, and 5000 µg/kg for
3 consecutive days for the ovariectomized animals and the three
highest doses for the immature animals. estradiol (10 µg/kg)
was used as a positive control and the corn oil vehicle was the
negative control.
the authors found an apparent dose-dependent increase in
the vaginal cornification (relative abundance of cornified cells)
in both groups of animals, although only the 5000 µg/kg level
was statistically significant in the immature females and only
the 500 and 5000 µg/kg levels in the ovariectomized females.
uterine weights were statistically significantly increased at the
5000 µg/kg level in both groups. the authors concluded that sc
administration of p-hydroxybenzoic acid produces an estrogenlike effect in cd-1 mice and that the effect is dose-dependent
(lemini et al. 1997).
the central toxicology laboratory (ctl) performed a dosesetting study (twomey 2000a) followed by a uterotrophic assay
(twomey 2000b) using immature cd-1 female mice.

in the dose-setting study, two female mice were administered
0.5 ml p-hydroxybenzoic acid per 100 g body weight by sc injection for 3 consecutive days. the stated dose levels in each of
four treatment groups was 0.5, 5.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg/kg day−1 .
clinical observations and animal body weights were recorded
daily. no effects on body weights were noted and no clinical
signs were observed. the authors concluded that these dose levels were suitable for a subsequent uterotrophic assay (twomey
2000a).
in the uterotrophic assay (twomey 2000b), immature female
alpk:ap f cd-1 mice (20-21 days of age) received a single sc
injection of p-hydroxybenzoic acid at each of the above dose
levels for three consecutive days. each treatment group consisted of 10 animals. a vehicle control (arachis oil) group and a
positive control group ( xxxd1880xxx  at 0.01 mg/kg day−1 )
were also included. body weights were determined daily, along
with clinical observations. at approximately 24 h after the last
dose was administered, all animals were killed. each uterus was
removed and its blotted weight recorded.
as in the dose-setting study, no adverse clinical effect was
noted and there was no effect on body weights or weight
gain. blotted uterus weights in animals administered  xxxd1880xxx  were significantly increased compared to controls, as expected. uterus weights in animals administered phydroxybenzoic acid were significantly decreased compared
to controls, although no dose-response was reported (twomey
2000b).
isobutylparaben
darbre et al. (2002) reported that isobutylparaben showed
significant estrogenic activity in the mouse uterotrophic assay
(1.2 or 12 mg per mouse, injected subcutaneously, once daily for
3 days (72 and 720 mg/kg day−1 equivalent)). the estrogenic
potency, however, was low compared to estradiol. the authors
concluded that branching of the alkyl chain (isobutylparaben vs.
butylparaben) increases estrogenic activity.
koda et al. (2005), in a study of the uterotophic effects of benzophenones and isobutylparaben used in ultraviolet sunscreens,
reported that isobutylparaben increased rat uterine weights.
isobutylparaben was given by subcutaneous injection to ovariectomized female crj:cd (sd) rats for 3 successive days at doses
of 100, 250, and 625 mg/kg day−1 . on day 4, the rats were killed
and the uteri removed. wet weights were determined, followed
by mincing, blotting, and dry weight determination. both wet
and dry uterine weights were increased, indicating estrogenic
activity. compared to 17beta-estradiol, however, isobutylparaben
was 4,000,000 times less potent.
benzylparaben
darbre et al. (2003) reported on the estrogenic activity of benzylparaben in the mouse uterine weight bioassay. when applied
topically at 33 mg per mouse (2500 mg/kg day−1 equivalent),
once daily for 3 days, estrogenic activity was reported, but not
when applied daily at a 100-mg level. the estrogenic potency,

parabens

however, was low compared to estradiol and there was no dose
response. the authors compared these findings with results reported by byford et al. (2002) and concluded that estrogenic
activity of parabens increases with the addition of an aryl group
(benzylparaben vs. methylparaben).
comparing parabens
routledge et al. (1998) used an in vivo (rat) uterotrophic assay
and in vitro assays to examine the estrogenic effects of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben. the
uteri of immature rats were used as the source of cytosolic estrogen receptors in a competitive binding assay. a yeast system, in
which activation of the human  xxxg730xxx  was measured
in terms of reporter gene (beta-galactocidase) activity, was used to
measure the presence of estrogens (positive findings were confirmed using an estrogen antagonist). immature female a1pk:ap
rats (21 to 22 days old, 38 to 55 g) and ovariectomized (at 6 to 8
weeks of age) rats of the same strain were used in a uterotrophic
assay. positive controls for comparison in the competitive binding assay were des and 4-nonylphenol. butylparaben did compete with [3 h]estradiol for binding to the rat  xxxg730xxx ,
but with an affinity 5 orders of magnitude lower than des and
between 10 and 100 times lower than 4-nonylphenol.
in the yeast system, 17beta-estradiol and 4-nonylphenol were
positive controls. parabens were positive in this assay, but only
at levels far higher than 17beta-estradiol. the level at which induction of beta-galactosidase began to increase was at molar concentrations of around 10−11 for 17beta-estradiol, 5 × 10−7 for butylparaben, 10−6 for propylparaben and 4-nonylphenol, 10−5 for
ethylparaben, and 10−4 for methylparaben. a negative control,
p-hydroxybenzoic acid, did not induce beta-galactocidase.
methylparaben and butylparaben were tested in the
uterotrophic assay in vivo at a range of doses. butylparaben
was given either orally or by subcutaneous injection at doses
of 4, 40, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, or 1200 mg/kg day−1 and
methylparaben at 40, 80, 400, or 800 mg/kg day−1 on each of
3 successive days. estradiol was used as the positive control
(at 0.4 mg/kg day−1 for oral gavage and 0.04 mg/kg day−1 for
subcutaneous injection) and arachis oil as the negative control.
methylparaben did not increase uterine weights at any dose
level via any route of administration. butylparaben given orally
produced a small, not statistically significant, increase in wet and
dry uterine weights at 800 and 1200 mg/kg day−1 . subcutaneous
doses of butylparaben increased uterine wet weights at doses
between 400 and 800 mg/kg day−1 , depending on the group
studied. all 800 mg/kg day−1 groups had increased wet and dry
uterine weights. the lowest level of butylparaben that produced
an effect (dry uterine weight increase) in any group was 200
mg/kg day−1 via subcutaneous injection (routledge et al. 1998).
hossaini et al. (2000) investigated the estrogenic activity of
p-hydroxybenzoic acid, methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben in the mouse (b6d2f1 strain) and rat (wistar strain)
uterotrophic assays. test compounds were dissolved in ethanol
and then diluted with peanut oil to give a final ethanol con-

49

centration of 10%. in the mouse studies, oral doses of methylparaben ranged from 1 to 1000 mg/kg day−1 ; propylparaben
from 1 to 100 mg/kg day−1 ; and a combination of methyl-,
ethyl-, and propylparaben at 100 mg/kg day−1 were given; and
subcutaneous (s.c.) injection doses of methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-,
and butylparaben and a combination of methyl-, ethyl-, and
propylparaben were given at 100 mg/kg day−1 . in mice, s.c.
doses of p-hydroxybenzoic acid were given of 5 and 100 mg/kg
day−1 . in the rat study, only butylparaben was given, sc at doses
of 100, 400, and 600 mg/kg day−1 .
these authors reported an increase in wet and dry uterine
weights, but only at the 600 mg/kg day−1 butylparaben dose,
confirming the results of routledge et al. (1998) of a weak estrogenic effect. in the mouse studies, no uterotrophic effect was
reported for any of the parabens alone or in combination, either by oral or subcutaneous injection at levels up to 100 mg/kg
day−1 , thus failing to confirm the positive findings of lemini
et al. (1997) reportedly at a 20× lower dose. the authors concluded that the parabens are not potent estrogens in vivo (hossaini et al. 2000).
lemini et al. (2003) reported the estrogenic activity of
parabens in the uterotrophic assay using mice and rats. immature cd1 female mice, ovariectomized adult cd1 female mice,
and immature wistar (iw) female rats were randomly assigned
to different treatment groups. treatment groups were administered (one subcutaneous injection per day for 3 days) one of
the parabens in  xxxd3034xxx  at doses equivalent to 0.36,
3.62, 36.2, 108, 362, or 1086 µmol/kg for the mice and 3.62,
36.2, 108, 362, or 1086 µmol/kg for the rats. positive controls
were administered estradiol  xxxd1891xxx  µg/kg and vehicle controls
received the vehicle alone. these authors calculated the relative
uterotrophic effect (rue), compared to estradiol at 100 and relative uterotrophic potency (rup), compared to estradiol on a
dose basis of each significant increase in uterotrophic weights.
methylparaben produced a significant increase in uterine
weights in immature cd1 mice at doses of 108 µmol/kg (rue
= 34; rup = 0.096), 362 µmol/kg (rue = 47; rup = 0.021),
and 1086 µmol/kg (rue = 54; rup = 0.006), but not at 0.36,
3.62, or 36.2 µmol/kg.
ethylparaben produced a significant increase in uterine
weights in immature cd1 mice at doses of 36.2 µmol/kg (rue
= 35; rup = 0.289), 362 µmol/kg (rue = 36; rup = 0.027),
and 1086 µmol/kg (rue = 64; rup = 0.005), but not at 0.36,
3.62, or 108 µmol/kg.
propylparaben produced a significant increase in uterine
weights in immature cd1 mice at doses of 108 µmol/kg (rue
= 54; rup = 0.062), 362 µmol/kg (rue = 51; rup = 0.020),
and 1086 µmol/kg (rue = 66; rup = 0.005), but not at 0.36,
3.62, or 36.2 µmol/kg.
butylparaben produced a significant increase in uterine
weights in immature cd1 mice at doses of 36.2 µmol/kg (rue
= 44; rup = 0.229), 108 µmol/kg (rue = 58; rup = 0.057),
362 µmol/kg (rue = 62; rup = 0.016), and 1086 µmol/kg
(rue = 91; rup = 0.003), but not at 0.36 or 3.62 µmol/kg.

(rue = 33; rup = 0.029), and 1086 µmol/kg (rue = 59; rup

propylparaben produced a significant increase in uterine
weights in immature wistar rats only at doses of 362 µmol/kg
(rue = 58; rup = 0.019) and 1086 µmol/kg (rue = 65; rup
= 0.008).
butylparaben produced a significant increase in uterine
weights in immature wistar rats only at 1086 µmol/kg (rue
= 67; rup = 0.006).
the authors interpreted these data as supporting a no observed effect level (noel) that varied as a function of both the
species and the chain length of the paraben, as shown in table
22. overall, the authors concluded that these data confirm the
estrogenic effect of parabens (lemini et al. 2003).
in another approach, lemini et al. (2004) conducted an analysis of the physical measurement parameters of uteri from mice
treated with parabens, vehicle alone, or estradiol. groups of adult
ovariectomized cd1 mice were administered methylparaben
(55 and 165 mg/kg), ethylparaben (60 and 180 mg/kg), propylparaben (65 and 195 mg/kg), and butylparaben (70 and 210
mg/kg) s.c. on each of 3 consecutive days. the positive control,
estradiol (10 µg/kg), and vehicle control (10 ml/kg polypropylene glycol) were given to other groups in the same fashion.
a day after the last exposure, animals were killed and uteri
dissected, blotted, weighed, and fixed for morphological analysis. the uteri were cut into 7-µm transverse sections. luminal epithelium heights, glandular epithelium heights, and myometrium widths were determined.
morphometric results were given in bar graphs with numerical expressions of percent increase over the vehicle control and
have been converted to a tabular format as shown in table 23.
overall, the authors concluded that this approach allows
a determination if the utertrophic effect involves both the

in the endometrium height and myometrium width (lemini et al.

table 24 summarizes the results of the uterotrophic assays
described above. golden et al. (2005) provided the potency comparisons, except for lemini et al. (2003, 2004); those values (the

taken from the studies themselves.
in vivo fish assay
comparing parabens
pedersen et al. (2000) used an in vivo fish assay to determine the estrogenic effects of ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben.
in this assay system, induction of the yolk precursor protein,
vitellogenin, is the measure of a positive estrogenic effect. juvenile rainbow trout (80 to 120 g) were given intraperitoneal
injections of test compounds, always using a 1 ml/kg injection
volume.

groups of 6 or 10 fish were injected at day 0 and 6 with one
of the parabens, with 17beta-estradiol as the positive control and
p-hydroxybenzoic acid as the negative control. butylparaben
was dissolved in 48% ethanol and given at doses of 50, 150, and
200 mg/kg. all others were dissolved in dmso. propylparaben,
ethylparaben, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were given at 100

and 300 mg/kg and 17beta-estradiol at 1 mg/kg. vitellogenin was
determined in plasma using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa).
at day 12, there was a statistically significant increase in
vitellogenin in fish given 100 or 300 mg/kg butylparaben (700×
that seen at day 0) when compared to controls; the authors did

52

not report if the two dose levels were different from each other.
similar results were reported for propylparaben (1000× that
seen at day 0), but ethylparaben only increased vitellogenin at
the high dose level (60× that seen at day 0). the 17beta-estradiol
dose did increase the levels of vitellogenin by a factor of 150 and
p-hydroxybenzoic acid had no effect at either dose (pedersen
et al. 2000).
 xxxg730xxx  binding
isobutylparaben
darbre et al. (2002) reported on the estrogenic activity of
isobutylparaben. the assays were similar to the study from
the same laboratory (byford et al. 2002) described later, absent the molecular modeling. isobutylparaben was able to displace [3 h]estradiol from the  xxxg730xxx  alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) of mcf-7
cell cytosol (beginning at around 104 molar excess). in addition, these authors reported an increase expression of estrogenregulated genes ( xxxd1891xxx −6 to 10−5 m concentration) and an increase in the growth of two estrogen-dependent human breast
cancer cell lines (also  xxxd1891xxx −6 to 10−5 m concentration). the authors compared these results with the byford et al. (2002) study
and concluded that branching of the alkyl chain (isobutylparaben
versus butylparaben) increases estrogenic activity.
benzylparaben
darbre et al. (2003) reported on the estrogenic activity of
benzylparaben. the assays were similar to the study from the
same laboratory (byford et al. 2002) described later, absent
the molecular modeling. benzylparaben was shown to displace
[3 h]estradiol from the  xxxg730xxx  of mcf-7 cell cytosol beginning
at around 103 molar excess. in addition, these authors reported
that benzylparaben increased expression of estrogen-regulated
genes ( xxxd1891xxx −5 to 10−4 m concentration) and increased the
growth of two estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell lines
(also  xxxd1891xxx −6 to 10−5 m concentration). the authors compared
these findings with previous results (byford et al. 2002) and concluded that the estrogenic activity increases with the addition of
an aryl group (benzylparaben > methylparaben).
comparing parabens
satoh et al. (2000) determined the competitive binding
of butylparaben, ethylparaben, isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, methylparaben, or propylparaben to human estrogen
receptor alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) and  xxxg731xxx . des and  xxxd346xxx  were the positive controls. the relative binding affinity (rba) was calculated
as a ratio of the ic50 values of the test compound to des and
the values are shown in table 25.
the ic50 values for des were 1.6 × 10−8 m and 1.7 × 10−8
m, respectively, for  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  and an arbitrary value of
100 was set for the rba for des. the authors concluded that
parabens may be endocrine disrupters (satoh et al. 2000).

paraben, isopropylparaben, and propylparaben in vitro using
proliferation of human breast cancer (mcf-7) cells and expression of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg1737xxx  (pr).
positive controls were des and 17beta-estradiol. estrogensensitive mcf-7 cells were inoculated into 96-well culture
plates, allowed to attach, decanted, and covered with phenol
red–free dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran–treated human serum. test
compounds were dissolved in ethanol, diluted in phenol red–free
dmem, added to the wells, and the cells incubated for 6 days.
cell numbers were estimated using a fluorescence assay, which
parallels the amount of nucleic acid. total cellular rna was isolated from treated cells and subjected to a reverse transcriptase–
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). a western blot analysis
was done using treated cells disrupted by sonication. binding of
parabens were determined using a commercial  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx 
system in the presence of excess 17beta-estradiol. inhibition was
calculated from absorbance values with and without 10−6 m
des.
maximum mcf-7 cell proliferation with 17beta-estradiol was
seen at 3 × 10−11 m, and with des around 10−9 m.
for ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben, the
peak was at 2 × 10−5 m, for methylparaben, 2 × 10−4 m, and
for isopropylparaben and isobutylparaben, 5 × 10−6 m.
rt-pcr amplification of rna was performed only on
cells treated with butylparaben and isobutylparaben, with 17betaestradiol as the positive control.
a decrease in  xxxg730xxx  expression and a large increase in pr
expression (25×) was seen with 17beta-estradiol. butylparaben
and isobutylparaben did not cause any  xxxg730xxx  expression decreases
up to 24 h, but did at 48 h; pr expression increases were 4×
and 5× at 24 and 48 h, respectively. the western blot assay
identified that 17beta-estradiol had the expected effect of a large
decrease in  xxxg730xxx  compared to the control and butylparaben and
isobutylparaben had a small decrease.
the rbas of parabens calculated in this study are given in

the authors stated that all parabens examined stimulated
mcf-7 cell growth, affected expression of  xxxg730xxx  and pr, and
bound to  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx . parabens with longer and branched
alkyl chains were more potent than those with short and straight
chains. because  xxxg731xxx  was not detected in the rt-pcr or western blot assay, the authors suggested that  xxxg730xxx  was primarily
expressed in mcf-7 cells.
the authors speculated that parabens could have an endocrine
disruption function (okubo et al. 2001).
byford et al. (2002) reported results of a study of the estrogenic effects of parabens in mcf-7 cells. a series of assays
were performed: (1) competitive  xxxg730xxx  binding between [2,4,6,73
h]estradiol and 1× to 106 × molar excess of methyl-, ethyl-,
propyl-, or butylparaben; (2) up regulation of an estrogenresponsive reporter gene transfected into mcf-7 cells; (3) regulation of expression of the ps2 gene (also estrogen-regulated);
and (4) cell proliferation. with some minor differences, preparation and treatment of mcf-7 cells was the same as described
in the above study.
cell proliferation was weakly stimulated by 10−5 m methylparaben, with stronger stimulation at 5 × 10−5 m and higher.
ethylparaben was a weak stimulant at 5 × 10−6 m and 10−5 m,
but stronger at 5 × 10−5 m and higher;  xxxd1891xxx −4 m, ethylparaben
had the same stimulation as 17beta-estradiol at 3 × 10−11 m.
propylparaben was a weak stimulant  xxxd1891xxx −6 m, but stronger at
5 × 10−6 m and higher; propylparaben at 5 × 10−5 m was indistinguishable from 17beta-estradiol at 3 × 10−11 m. butylparaben
had a stimulant effect  xxxd1891xxx −6 m, but was stronger at 5 × 10−6 m
and higher; butylparaben  xxxd1891xxx −5 m was indistinguishable from
17beta-estradiol at 3 × 10−11 m. inclusion of the antiestrogen ici
182,780 reversed the effect of 17beta-estradiol and each of the
parabens, suggesting that the parabens stimulation of mcf-7
cell proliferation is an estrogenic phenomenon.
the results of the other assays were consistent with these
findings. 17beta-estradiol eliminated [2,4,6,7-3 h]estradiol binding
to  xxxg730xxx  in mcf-7 lysates at a molar excess of 10:1. tamoxifen
had the same effect at a molar excess of 1000:1. as a negative
control, dexamethasone had no effect up to a molar excess of

53

105 :1. propyl- and butylparaben began to reduce the binding
of labeled estradiol at a molar excess of 104 :1, a pattern that
continued with addition of more paraben; at a molar excess of
106 :1, however, there was still on the order of 20% binding of the
radiolabeled estradiol. methyl- and ethylparaben did not affect
binding until a molar excess of 105 :1 was reached.
up-regulation of an estrogen-responsive reporter gene transfected into mcf-7 cells appeared to be less consistent a measure
of estrogenic potential of parabens. over 24 h, methylparaben
up to 10−4 m had no effect, but 10−4 m did up regulate over 7
days. over 24 h, ethylparaben up regulated  xxxd1891xxx −5 and 10−4 m,
but only  xxxd1891xxx −4 m over 7 days. over 24 h, propylparaben up
regulated  xxxd1891xxx −5 and 10−4 m, but only  xxxd1891xxx −5 m over 7 days—
the 10−4 m concentration appeared to down-regulate expression.
over 24 h, butylparaben up-regulated  xxxd1891xxx −5 m, but not at
10−4 m, and over 7 days, butylparaben up-regulated  xxxd1891xxx −5 m,
but again not  xxxd1891xxx −4 m. each of the parabens also had the effect of up-regulating ps2 as determined by northern blotting in
which ps2 mrna levels were increased, but this assay did not
yield quantitative results.
these authors also used molecular modeling of the  xxxg730xxx 
ligand-binding domain (lbd) using the crystal structure from
the brookhaven protein database. of the three dimers in the
asymmetric structure, the one with the a and b subunits was
selected and modified to remove duplicate residues remote from
the lbd and complexed 17beta-estradiol, but to retain all water
molecules and add nonpolar hydrogens. paraben ligands were
placed within the lbd site with their phenolic hydroxyl group
taking the position formerly occupied by the phenolic hydroxy
group of the 17beta-estradiol. energy minimization were carried
out on both protein and ligand with a nonbonded interaction
energy cut-off of 15 å. a dielectric constant of 1.0 was used.
the interaction energies of the protein ligand complexes were
calculated as the energy of the complex minus the individual energies of the protein and the paraben. parabens with alkyl chain
lengths up to 10 were used in the model, as were combinations of
two ligand molecules. the resulting interaction energies were
all negative, implying to the authors that there was no steric
hindrance in accommodating these ligands in the lbd (byford
et al. 2002).
lemini et al. (2003), in their uterotrophic assay in mice and
rats, also measured the relative binding affinities of parabens to
estradiol. these data are given in table 27. the authors stated
that these results are in agreement with those of byford et al.
(2002) noted above.
pugazhendhi et al. (2005) extended the work of okubo et
al. (2001) and byford et al. (2002) by examining the activity
of p-hydroxybenzoic acid compared to methylparaben using
a competitive binding assay in mcf-7 (human breast cancer)
cell lysates, regulation of expression of an estrogen-responsive
reporter gene (ere-cat) in mcf-7 cells, and proliferation of
estrogen-dependent mcf-7 and zr-75-1 cells (another human
breast cancer cell line).

in a competitive binding assay, a mcf-7 cell lysate was incubated with 16 × 10−10 m 17beta-estradiol. increasing concentrations of methylparaben demonstrated that a 43.3% inhibition of
estradiol binding could be obtained with a 2.5 × 106 -fold molar
excess of methylparaben.  xxxd2907xxx .7% inhibition required a 5.0 ×
106 -fold molar excess of methylparaben and  xxxd2051xxx .5% inhibition required a 1.0 × 107 -fold molar excess. increasing concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoic acid demonstrated that a 53.9%
inhibition of estradiol binding could be obtained with a 5.0 ×
106 -fold molar excess of methylparaben. a 98.7% inhibition required a 1.0 × 107 -fold molar excess of p-hydroxybenzoic acid.
cat gene expression was stimulated 2-fold by 17beta-estradiol
 xxxd1891xxx −8 m and higher concentrations. cat gene expression was
stimulated 1.5-fold by methylparaben  xxxd1891xxx −3 m (highest concentration tested) and 1.25-fold by p-hydroxybenzoic acid at 5
× 10−4 m (highest concentration tested).
in an mcf-7 cell proliferation assay in which the culture
medium was changed every 24 h, p-hydroxybenzoic acid resulted in a small (less than a doubling) but statistically significant increase in proliferation  xxxd1891xxx −6 , 10−5 , and 10−4 m, but
not  xxxd1891xxx −7 or 10−3 m. more than a 10-fold increase in cell proliferation was seen with 17beta-estradiol  xxxd1891xxx −8 m. the authors
noted that the results using mcf-7 cells were not reproducible
when the culture medium was changed every 3 to 4 days. using
zr-75-1 cells, p-hydroxybenzoic acid was tested at the same
concentrations, with medium changes every 24 h, but only 10−5
m p-hydroxybenzoic acid caused a small increase in cell proliferation, compared to a 10-fold increase in cell proliferation seen
with 17beta-estradiol  xxxd1891xxx −8 m.
the authors interpreted the findings as indicative of estrogenic activity of p-hydroxybenzoic activity in these assays
(pugazhendhi et al. 2005).
 xxxg183xxx  binding
fang et al. (2003) described a recombinant  xxxg183xxx 
(ar) competitive binding assay and used the results to survey
202 chemicals, including methylparaben and propylparaben. a
radiolabeled competitor molecule was combined with radiolabeled 17alpha-methyl-[3 h]methyltrienolone and the  xxxg183xxx  protein in a test tube on ice. incubation for 18 to 20 h
was followed by adding a hydroxylapatite (hap) slurry (60%

hap and 40%  xxxd3449xxx ). the hap pellet was alcohol extracted and counted. the ar binding affinity was expressed as
the relative binding affinity (rba), which was the inhibitory
concentration for 17alpha-methyl-methyltrienolone divided by that
for the test chemical, expressed as a percent. the rba of 17alphamethyl-methyltrienolone was, by definition, 100%. the rba for
propylparaben was 0.0010%. no rba was reported for methylparaben because it was found to be a nonbinder.
the authors interpreted these findings in terms of the structure/activity relationship between the  xxxg183xxx  and
each class of chemicals. for the phenols, they stated that
the rba for the  xxxg183xxx  correlated positively with
the octanol/water partition coefficient. the authors noted that
some of the phenols that are typical er receptor ligands are also
active in ar binding (fang et al. 2002).
reporter cell lines
comparing parabens
gomez et al. (2005) used three reporter cells lines: heln
cells, which are er negative; helneralpha cells, which express
 xxxg730xxx ; and helnerbeta cells, which express  xxxg731xxx , to determine the
binding of various parabens. these cell lines were derived from
hela cells by transfection with the appropriate plasmid. nonspecific binding was measured by interference with luciferase
production.
at concentrations up to 10−5 m, p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben had no effect on nonspecific binding. butylparaben, however, beginning
at 3 × 10−6 m did exhibit nonspecific binding as measured by
a decreased luciferase production.
specific binding to  xxxg730xxx  in helneralpha cells and  xxxg731xxx  in
helnerbeta cells was determined. at concentrations up to 10−5
m, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and methylparaben had no effect.
 xxxd1891xxx −5 m, the ranking of effect was butylparaben > propylparaben > ethylparaben. there was no difference between binding to  xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  (gomez et al. 2005).
gene expression profiling
comparing parabens
terasaka et al. (2006) used expression of estrogen-responsive
genes to examine the estrogenic activity of parabens and other
phenols. based on a determination of up-regulation or downregulation by estrogen, a dna microarray assay system (infogenes, tsukuba, japan) was prepared containing 172 estrogenresponsive genes (108 up-regulated and 64 down-regulated) and
31 calibration/expression markers.
mcf-7 cells (human breast carcinoma cell line) were cultured
for 3 days and then treated with estrogen  xxxd1891xxx  nm concentration
or 10 µm of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, or
butylparaben for 3 days. mrna was extracted and purified. a
2-µg aliquot from the control and each test sample was labeled
using cy3 and cy5 dyes, respectively. both cy3 and cy5 labeled probes were mixed and denatured and hybridized with the

parabens

prepared dna microarray. image analysis was used to determine
the ratio of cy3 and cy5 signal from each spot in the microarray.
data from spots with poor hybridization were removed from the
data processing.
although the set of 172 estrogen-responsive genes had been
devised, these authors further narrowed the selection to 120
genes that more reliably (in the view of the authors, based on
reproducibility as influenced by mrna stability, background
level, cross-hybridization) responded to the phenol group of
chemicals while showing differences between them.
using the binding of mrna from treated and control mcf-7
cells to dna from these 120 optimal genes, the authors prepared
scattergrams that depicted the response of each phenol and estrogen. a correlation coefficient (r) for each test compound
was calculated on the basis of linear regression and the statistical significance of the correlation. for methylparaben the r
value was negative (0.21); and positive for ethylparaben, 0.19,
propylparaben, 0.74, and butylparaben, 0.60. of these results,
significant correlations were observed for propylparaben and
ethylparaben only. the authors further noted that the profiles of
propylparaben and ethylparaben were closer to each other than
were the profiles of either compared to estrogen and suggested
that the expression of genes specific to parabens is contributing
to the profiles.
endocrine disruption
overview
harvey and johnson (2002) suggested approaches to the assessment to toxicity data with end points related to endocrine
disruption. they noted that studies of endocrine disruption have
proliferated, with most relating to estrogenic effects. the authors
suggested that all glands, tissues, receptors, transporter proteins, and enzymes that comprise the endocrine system should
be considered as targets and toxicity evaluated using a weightof-evidence approach considering all available data. although
structure-activity relationships and in vitro/in vivo screens provide useful data, the authors asserted that repeated-dose studies
with defined end points will provide the most powerful tools
for hazard assessment. the authors noted that the scientific
committee on toxicity, ecotoxicity, and the environment of
the european commission has stated its view that toxicity of the
endocrine system should be considered in the same way as other
target organs and that endocrine disruption, per se, is not a toxic
end point in itself, but is a mechanism by which toxic effects may
occur. harvey and johnson (2002) argued that knowledge of the
toxic effect, the no observed effect level, and reversibility are as
important as identifying the inherent hormone-like property.
carcinogenesis or reproductive/developmental toxicity are
end points, according to these authors, that are of importance,
regardless of whether caused by an endocrine disrupter or not,
but that endocrine effects may help identify mechanism of action. they also noted that endocrine effects are usually reversible
upon removal of treatment/stimulation.

55

these authors further suggested that consideration be given
to exposure issues, including the possibility that the effects of
very low potency estrogens may be irrelevant at low exposures.
they noted that endocrine disruption may not always be the
critical or most sensitive end point for a given chemical; e.g.,
again for low potency estrogens, if endocrine effects occur only
at extreme doses, then it may be that other system toxicity may
be the critical toxicity in hazard evaluation (harvey and johnson
2002).
foster (2004) presented an overview of endocrine active
chemicals in which he discussed the major hypothesis proposed
for the effects of endocrine active agents on human reproduction and development. he also commented on the use of animal
surrogates to help test the hypothesis and establish biological
plausibility and the strengths and weaknesses of current and
proposed testing methods and potential improvements.
endocrine active chemicals may be
•

estrogens or estrogen mimics, in which case the safety
concern relates to acceleration in puberty, fertility,
pregnancy/birth, and female reproductive target tissues
(ovary, uterus, and breast);
• (anti-)androgen-like, with concerns regarding birth defects in males, delays in puberty, fertility, and male
reproductive target tissues (prostate and testis);
• anti-thyroid-like, with concerns about retarded growth,
central nervous system (cns) effects, and hearing
defects.
the safety concerns are significant because of increases in
prevalence of human male reproductive disorders, including decreases in sperm parameters, increases in testicular maldescent
or other genitalia problems, and increased incidence of testicular
cancer (germ cell derived). these end points may be linked to a
critical period in utero and the perinatal period as a result of fetal
hormone action. during pregnancy weeks 7 to 8, the sexually indifferent fetus experiences a window of hormone susceptibility.
development as a female is largely hormone-independent, but
development as a male is entirely hormone-dependent. for example, the male-determining gene, sry, controls differentiation
of sertoli cells, which in turn influence leydig cell proliferation
and production of testosterone. testosterone influences testicular descent and masculinization of the internal and external
genitalia, etc. sertoli cells also influence sperm production in
adult life and regression of mullerian (female) ducts.
pharmaceuticals, such as  xxxd1880xxx  and progesterone
analogues, are understood to disturb reproduction and development in humans, but there is esentially no evidence that environmental endocrine active chemicals can cause similar responses.
possible explanations for the absence of findings include low
concentrations that never reach the threshold needed to trigger
adverse responses and the low power that epidemiology studies
have to detect and link prenatal exposure with an outcome that
may only manifest in the adult.

56

cosmetic ingredient review

as a consequence, animal surrogates have been used. in the
case of dibutyl phthalate, for example, end points that suggest
adverse effects include anogenital distance reduction (feminization); nipple development (areolae retention), immature testis
and epididymis, hypospadias, and testicular lesions. dibutyl phthalate, however, does not interact with the  xxxg183xxx .
considering all end points, the lowest no observed adverse effect level (noael) was stated to be 50 mg/kg day−1 (from
a gavage study). comparing this to a maximal level of exposure to dibutyl phthalate from all sources of women of childbearing age of 113 µg/kg day−1 results in a safety factor of
almost 500.[note: the cosmetic ingredient review (cir) expert panel, in its re-review of dibutyl phthalate, considered
the same 50 mg/kg day−1 noael, and combined it with a
dibutyl phthalate exposure of 9.13 µg/kg day−1 from use of
cosmetics—with a margin of safety of around 5000 (andersen
2005).]
it was noted that other phthalate esters have effects similar to dibutyl phthalate, including diethylhexyl phthalate and
butylbenzyl phthalate, but that other phthalate esters have no endocrine activity at all, including diethyl phthalate and dimethyl
phthalate.
linuron, a herbicide structurally related to  xxxd2143xxx , was
presented as another endocrine active chemical. animal testing has identified increased resorption sites (at maternally toxic
levels), but no birth defects. in a three-generation reproduction
study, decreased weight gain in f0 males, females, and offspring
were seen, along with reduced pup survival. in a two-generation
reproduction study, no effects on fertility were seen, but tubular
atrophy in the testis and epididymal inflammation were found.
overall, linuron was considered a weak, competitive,  xxxg183xxx  antagonist, with effects seen in multigenerational
studies where all offspring were examined.
reiterating the absence of human data that can identify adverse effects associated with endocrine active chemicals, it was
stated that animal studies are necessary. it is critical that such
studies, themselves, be designed to maximize the likelihood that
adverse effects will be detected (foster 2004).
government programs
the environment directorate general of the european commission organized a european workshop on endocrine disrupters
in june 2001. the workshop highlighted the potential effects of
endocrine disrupting chemicals on human health and wildlife
as an issue of increasing concern to all sectors of society. it
was stated that a significant number of questions still need
to be answered and the challenge facing regulators, industry,
and academia is how these can be resolved in a rapid costeffective manner whilst still providing scientifically robust outputs. the workshop recommended information exchange and
international coordination, identified research and development
needs, suggested needed test methods development and testing
strategies, and establishment of monitoring programs, but no
short-term action regarding specific chemicals was suggested

(report of the european workshop on endocrine disrupters
2001).
the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has established an endocrine disrupter methods validation subcommittee of the national advisory council for environmental policy
and technology to address the development and refinement of
assays to reduce animal use, refine procedures involving animals
to make them less stressful, and replace animals where scientifically appropriate (epa 2006a). when complete, epa will use
these validated methods or assays to identify and characterize
the endocrine activity of pesticides, commercial chemicals, and
environmental contaminants, specifically in relation to estrogen,
androgen, and thyroid hormones. in addition, epa is working
with the organization for economic cooperation and development’s endocrine testing and assessment task force to validate and harmonize endocrine screening tests of international
interest. epa’s web site lists a table of the current status of the
development and validation of endocrine disrupter assays (epa
2006b).
fda’s national center for toxicological research has established an endocrine disrupter knowledge base (ekdb). a
computer model has been validated for predicting  xxxg730xxx  binding for estrogenic or estrogen-like compounds and
data are available for 791 chemicals, but do not include the
parabens (fda 2008).

clinical assessment of safety
irritation and sensitization
comparing parabens
in a review article, sokol (1952) described a study in
which methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben were each applied to the backs of 50 humans at concentrations of 5%, 7%, 10%, 12%, and 15% in  xxxd3034xxx .
test compounds were applied daily for 5 days, and patches were
then removed and the sites scored. the concentrations of individual parabens that produced no irritation were methylparaben,
5%; ethylparaben, 7%; propylparaben, 12%; and butylparaben,
5%. higher concentrations produced some evidence of irritation.
in a repeated-insult patch test (ript), each paraben at the “no
effect” concentration above was applied to the skin of 50 subjects (25 males/25 females) for 4 to 8 h every other day for 3
weeks (10 applications). following a 3-week rest, the materials
were reapplied at induction concentrations for 24 to 48 h. no
sensitization was reported.
hjorth and trolle-lassen (1963) reported on the sensitivity
and cross-sensitivity of eczematous patients to paraben esters.
preliminary tests were conducted using routine patch tests with
a mixture comprised of 10% methylparaben, 2% ethylparaben,
and 2% propylparaben in equal parts aquaphor and water. fifteen cases positive to this mixture were assayed for benzylparaben sensitivity, and 7/15 were sensitive to both 1% and 5%
benzylparaben solutions. in further testing in 32 patients, using

32 cases tested with 5% paraben esters in petrolatum or in equal parts  xxxd3471xxx  and water; one case was not tested
with propylparaben or benzylparaben.

parabens at 5% in petrolatum or in  xxxd3471xxx  and water to determine cross-reactions, about two thirds of the patients sensitive
to one of the paraben esters also reacted to one or several other
esters. these data are shown in table 28.
wuepper (1967) also reported cross-reactivity to parabens.
four patients with known paraben sensitivity were patch-tested
with methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben (5% in petrolatum). in addition, three of these patients
were patch-tested with 0.1% and 1% of each paraben and 0.1%,
1%, and 5% p-hydroxybenzoic acid. these subjects were also
given 0.1 ml p-hydroxybenzoic acid intradermally. results revealed cross-reactivity to each of the paraben esters. all four
patients reacted to one or more of the esters at 5%; only one
patient reacted at 0.1%. one patient had positive reactions to
intradermal and topical p-hydroxybenzoic acid.
marzulli et al. (1968) reported results of an ript used
to test the sensitizing potential of mixtures of methylparaben
and propylparaben in males. the test mixture was applied under occlusion to the subject’s arm for 48 h; the solution was
then reapplied. this procedure was repeated for 3 weeks (10
induction applications). at the highest paraben concentration
tested, one group was alternately irritated by topical application of 5%  xxxd3215xxx  (sls) under occlusion for
24 h, followed by application of parabens for 48 h. five such

cycles were used for induction. following a 2-week rest, the
test mixtures were reapplied under 72-h challenge patches.
on one skin site in all subjects, 10% sls was applied for
1 h before challenge application. at another site, no sls was
used.
results are summarized in table 29. the authors concluded
that sensitization to parabens is not a problem in the united states
where these compounds are used at 0.1% to 0.3% in topical
medicaments (marzulli et al. 1968).
evans (1970) observed that, in most cases, individuals who
are sensitive to parabens have chronic dermatoses that may be
in continual contact with these ingredients. fisher (1971) stated
that the incidence of paraben contact sensitization in healthy
americans is low, considering the extensive use of these materials, and concluded that topically applied parabens do not
pose any significant hazard to the public. marzulli and maibach
(1973) reaffirmed this conclusion.
pevny and glassl (1971) reported on a new test method
for sensitization in the oral mucosa. methylparaben and ethylparaben, in increasing concentrations, were studied for their effect on the oral mucous membrane of 39 subjects. they described
toxic limit concentrations for methylparaben and ethylparaben
of 5% and 10%, respectively. one subject had a reaction of the
oral mucous membrane to methylparaben.

cosmetic ingredient review

thune and granholt (1975) administered 37 patients with
recurrent urticaria a tablet orally containing 100 mg methylparaben plus 100 mg propylparaben on day 1 and a tablet containing 150 mg of each paraben on day 2. five subjects exhibited
reactions to paraben treatment. larson (1977) stated that, as a
sensitizer, methylparaben is too small to act as an antigen and,
instead, acts as a hapten that binds to tissue protein to form a
complex that is antigenic.
fisher (1979) coined the term “paraben paradox” in which
paraben-sensitive patients who present with allergic contact dermatitis when paraben-containing pharmaceuticals are applied to
eczematous or ulcerated skin can tolerate paraben-containing
cosmetics applied to normal, unbroken skin, including the eyelid. he concluded that women who are allergic to the parabens
can utilize paraben-containing cosmetics without any reactions
providing the skin is normal and not been subjected to a dermatitis in the past.
hegyi (1979) noted a tendency toward increased incidence
in paraben contact allergy in europe over time. from 1968 to
1972, a 0.3% incidence of paraben sensitization was reported.
from 1973 to 1977, the incidence increased to 1.5%.
table 30 summarizes results of patch tests of parabens on patients with and without skin problems reported between 1962 and
1982. the studies by cramer and unrein (1963) and maucher
(1974) in table 30 involved patients with high sensitivity toward “para-agents,” a group of compounds in which parabens
are considered a member.
adams and maibach (1985) reported a five-year study of
cosmetic reactions. of the 713 patients with cosmetic related
reactions, 554 were reported to have no chronic skin disease,
115 had atopic dermatitis or a history of same, and 36 patients
had a history of other chronic dermatitis. patch testing identified
19 individuals with positive reactions to unspecified parabens.
menne and hjorth (1988) reported on results of routine patch
testing with paraben esters. in 8020 patients tested consecutively
with a paraben mixture in a standard series, 76 individuals reacted positively. testing with the individual parabens was used
to confirm the result, to reduce the chance that the result was due
to excited skin syndrome. the authors stated that the parabens
are weak sensitizers, and around 1% sensitization should be
expected.
menne et al. (1991) published a multicenter study of reactions to methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone
(mci/mi) preservative in which they presented data on 4713 patients seen in 22 european clinics and patch-tested with mci/mi,
nickel, formaldehyde, and parabens. there was a variation from
0% positive reactions to parabens to 4.7%. overall there were
51 positive reactions to parabens, for an overall percentage of
1.08%.
goh and yuen (1994) reported patch test results in 274 metal
workers (180 male, 94 female) with dermatitis. one female
worker had a positive patch test to paraben mix (3% each of benzylparaben, butylparaben, ethylparaben, methylparaben, and
propylparaben).

on the supposition that individuals sensitized to parabens in
topical medications and cosmetics may experience flares of dermatitis from parabens in food and systemic medications, veien et
al. (1996) reported on oral challenge with parabens in parabensensitive patients. a placebo-controlled oral challenge with a
mixture of 100 mg of methylparaben and 100 mg of propylparaben was performed in 14 patients with a positive patch test
to paraben-mix. two of the 14 patients had flares of their dermatitis after challenge with oral parabens, but not the placebo.
one patient had a flare at a paraben patch test site on the back.
the other 11 patients had no reaction to the oral challenge. the
two patients with flares of their dermatitis were instructed regarding foods to avoid. at follow-up after attempts to avoid these
foods for 1 to 2 months, no improvement in their dermatitis was
seen.
schnuch et al. (1998) presented the results of a 5-year multicenter study (24 allergy departments) of patch testing with
preservatives, antimicrobials, and industrial biocides. patch testing procedures were not identical across the range of facilities.
patch test data from 22,602 patients tested with parabenmix (15% in petrolatum) in the standard series indicated 364
positives (1.6%). in women, the figure was 1.5%, and in men,
1.6%. no difference in reactions was seen up to 60 years of age,
but a jump in percentage of positive reactions was seen in the
60- to 80-year-old group and in the >80 age group (schnuch
et al. 1998).
lestringant et al. (1999) reported on allergic contact dermatitis in the united arab emirates. from 1989 to 1996, 373 patients
(143 men and 230 women) presented with possible contact allergies and were patch-tested at a single dermatology clinic.
positive patch test results to paraben-mix were seen in 4 men
(2.8%) and 15 women (6.5%) for an overall frequency of 5.1%.
wilkinson et al. (2002) reported a 10-year overview of results
of preservatives patch testing. the percentage of positive reactions was relatively flat over this time period, varying between
0.5% and 1%. this may be compared with the frequency of reactions to methyldibromo glutaronitrile, which steadily increased
in europe from just under 0.5% in 1991 to 3.5% in 2000.
in a review of hypersensitivity to preservatives, sasseville
(2004) stated that the rate of sensitization to parabens has remained remarkably constant over the years.
north american contact dermatitis group

storrs et al. (1989) reported the prevalence of allergic reactions in patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis who
were tested with 19 vehicle and preservative allergens. of the
661 patients tested from 1984 to 1985 with paraben mix (12% in
petrolatum—3% each of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben), there were seven allergic reactions,
three doubtful allergic reactions, and three irritant reactions.

parabens

propylparaben, butylparaben, and benzylparaben) had 2.3%
positive test results in 3476 patients tested from 1992 to 1994.
this was compared to a positive reaction response of 1.3% in
patients tested from 1989 to 1990.
in 3086 patients tested from 1994 to 1996 (marks et al.
1998), there were 1.8% positive allergic reactions to parabens
mix (15%–3% each of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and benzylparaben).
in 4096 patients tested from 1996 to 1998 (marks et al.
2000), there were 1.7% positive allergic reactions to parabens
mix (12%–3% each of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben).
in 5803 patients patch-tested between 1998 and 2000 (marks
et al. 2003), there were 1.0% positive reactions to parabens
mix (12%–3% each of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben).
in 4898 patients patch-tested from 2001 to 2002 (pratt et al.
2004), there were 0.6% positive allergic reactions to parabens
mix (12%–3% each of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben).
product irritation and sensitization testing
a number of product formulations containing parabens at
concentrations of 0.1% to 0.8% have been tested for human skin
irritation. these studies are summarized in table 31.
several product formulations containing parabens have been
tested for skin sensitization. tests include: schwartz-peck
prophetic patch tests on product formulations containing 0.2%
methylparaben and 0.1% propylparaben, or 0.2% butylparaben;
draize-shelanski repeated-insult patch tests on product formulations containing 0.1% to 0.8% methyl-, propyl-, butyl-, and/or
ethylparaben; and kligman maximization tests on product formulations containing 0.2% methylparaben and 0.1% propylparaben. the results and other details of these studies are summarized in table 32.
photocontact sensitization
multiple parabens
each of four products containing 0.2% methylparaben and/or
0.2% propylparaben were tested for evidence of photo-induced
contact sensitization in 27 to 30 subjects (food and drug research labs 1978a, 1978b, 1979, 1980). the volar forearm was
designated as the site of test material applications. one forearm
was irradiated and the other served as a nonirradiated control
site. about 0.2 ml of the test material was applied under an
occlusive patch for 24 h.
the irradiated test site was subjected to nonerythrogenic ultraviolet radiation for 15 min at a distance of 10 to 12 cm from
the source, receiving a uv light dose of 4400 µw/cm2 . the
light source consisted of four ge f40 bl black light lamps of
a wavelength in the uva range with a peak at 360 nm. these
procedures were repeated 3 days a week until 10 treatments had
been given and then twice again after a 10- to 14-day rest period.

61

each of the product formulations produced mild reactions with
and without irradiation, but there were no reactions indicative
of photocontact sensitization (food and drug research labs
1978a, 1978b, 1979, 1980).
six of the draize-shelanski repeated-insult patch tests summarized in table 25 used supplemental ultraviolet light exposure after the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, and challenge patches. test
sites were irradiated for 1 minute at a distance of 12 inches from
the source. the light source consisted of the hanovia tannette
mark i lamp, which has a continuous emission spectrum from
300 to 370 nm and an output of no more than 150 watts. the
formulations tested in these studies contained methyl-, propyl-,
and/or butylparaben at concentrations of 0.1% to 0.8%. of the
607 subjects thus treated, none had reactions indicative of photosensitization.

phototoxicity
multiple parabens
four product formulations, each containing 0.2% methylparaben and/or 0.2% propylparaben, were tested for human phototoxicity (food and drug research labs 1978a, 1978b, 1979,
1980). the volar forearms of 10 to 12 subjects were scrubbed
with alcohol and tape-stripped to remove several layers of cornified epithelium. about 0.2 ml of the test material was applied
and occluded for 24 h. the test site on one forearm was subjected
to nonerythemogenic ultraviolet light for 15 min at a distance
of 10 to 12 cm from the source, receiving a uva light dose
of 4400 µw/cm2 . the light source consisted of four ge f40
bl black light lamps of a wavelength in the uva range with a
peak at 360 nm. one subject in each of two of the tested groups
showed mild irritation at both control and irradiated sites. there
were no reactions indicative of phototoxicity.
the schwartz-peck prophetic patch tests summarized in
table 32 used a single supplemental uv light exposure after
the second patch. test sites were irradiated for 1 min at a distance of 12 inches from the source. the light source consisted
of the hanovia tannette mark i lamp already described. the
formulations tested in these studies contained either 0.2% butylparaben or both 0.2% methylparaben and 0.1% propylparaben.
of the 1034 subjects thus tested, only 3 had mild skin reactions (ctfa 1978c; research testing laboratories 1978; ctfa
1980k).
ocular irritation
methylparaben
aqueous solutions of 0.10% to 0.30% methylparaben instilled in the eyes of humans produced moderate hyperemia,
slight lacrimation, and slight burning. all symptoms disappeared
within 1 min. these results were confirmed when instillation
of these solutions several times daily into the eyes of more
than 100 subjects produced no irritation (simonelli and marri
1939).

saiki et al. (1972) reported a case in which a patient developed paraplegia following intrathecal chemotherapy. they
suggested that methylparaben, contained in the chemotherapy
agents, may have caused damage to the spinal nerve roots
within the subarachnoid space, accounting for the neurologic
deficit.

kaminer et al. (1982) reported a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to orally administered methylparaben. a male patient
given haloperidol syrup developed an urticarial maculopapular
rash over his entire body, except his face. all medications were
discontinued and blood drawn for a macrophage migration inhibition test. there was no response in the test to haloperidol
tablets, but there was to haloperidol in solution and to methylparaben. the authors suggest that immunologic tests may help

parabens

the clinician isolate the specific cause of an antigenic reaction
and allow therapy to continue with a different formulation.
kojima (1992) reported a case of facial contact urticaria in
response to methylparaben in a cosmetic product.
propylparaben
lindner et al. (1989) reported a case of allergic contact dermatitis caused by propyl hydroxybenzoate (propylparaben) following the use of varicosan bandages.
benzylparaben
tosti et al. (1989) reported the case of a 43-year-old woman
with a 3-year history of relapsing erythematous nodules and
small plaques on her trunk, but no history of other skin disease or atopy. she had a positive patch test to benzylparaben.
because the patient had been using systemic and topical preparations in which benzylparaben was the preservative, the authors
concluded that this case was an example of a deeply located
allergan that may cause dermal allergic contact dermatitis.
würbach et al. (1993) reported a contact allergy to benzyl
alcohol and benzylparaben. a 50-year-old man, who developed
a relapsing tinea-like contact dermatitis, had a positive patch
test result to parabens mix. symptoms disappeared with treatment (corticosteroids without preservatives) and discontinuance
of daily showering with perfumed soap and foam bath preparations. the authors concluded that the patient’s reaction to the
paraben mix represented a reaction to benzyl alcohol, because
methylparaben, ethylparaben, or propylparaben alone did not
produce a reaction.
multiple parabens
in the older literature, paraben hypersensitivity has been reported. in many, sensitization followed topical application of
paraben medicaments to broken skin (sarkany 1960; schorr
and mohajerin 1966; schamberg 1967; reed 1969; wulf and
memmesheimer 1969; fisher 1975; husain 1977; simpson
1978; henry et al. 1979). other cases of sensitivity from
parabens in anesthetic solutions injected intravenously are reported (latronica et al. 1969; aeling and nuss 1974; nagel
et al. 1977).
hjorth and trolle-lassen (1962) reported over 140 cases of
paraben sensitivity. epstein (1968) ascribed the incidence of
sensitization, which appeared to be higher in denmark than in
the united states, to the use of higher concentrations of parabens
in denmark than in the united states. in their textbook, rook
et al. (1968) stated that sensitization reactions were reported as a
result of paste-bandages containing parabens applied to venous
stasis ulcer.
case reports have continued to appear. fisher (1982) reported
three patients who acquired an allergic contact dermatitis from
the application of cortaid cream. butylparaben and methylparaben were the preservatives used in this product and it was to
them that the three patients reacted in patch testing. one patient
in particular was said to exhibit the so-called “paraben paradox.” as a result of the use of the cream, the patient developed

65

a widespread dermatitis of the left axilla, chest, and upper abdomen. two weeks later, the patient used a deodorant spray,
containing parabens. only the left axilla flared; there was no reaction at the right axilla. this suggests the “paraben paradox” in
which paraben-sensitive individuals can use paraben-containing
topical applications providing the skin is not eczematized, nor
has been the site of a previous dermatitis.
fisher (1993, 1996) also published articles in which he suggested that the parabens are remarkably safe, effective preservatives and argued that no difficulty with sensitization or allergic contact dermatitis is being encountered from the presence of
parabens in cosmetics which are in contact with the thin, delicate
skin of the eyelids, a common site of allergic contact dermatitis
from many other contactants.
javors et al. (1984) and schwartz et al. (1984) reported hypersensitivity reactions to parabens after barium enema examinations.
fine and dingman (1988) reported hypersensitivity dermatitis following suction-assisted lipectomy as a complication of
paraben preservatives in the local anesthetic. previous cases of
allergic reactions to parabens in anesthetics were reported by
ivy (1983) and wahl (1983).
carradori et al. (1990) reported a case of systemic contact
dermatitis due to parabens. a generalized eczematous eruption
involving the trunk and limbs of a 65-year-old woman was observed after a 1-g intramuscular injection of ampicillin for a
bacterial infection. patch tests with a standard series identified
positive reactions to balsam of peru and paraben-mix at 48 and
72 h. further patch tests showed reactions to methylparaben and
ethylparaben present in the ampicillin at 18 mg/g. the authors
suggested that sensitization to parabens was probably the result
of previous use of topical agents for treatment of leg ulcers,
although no specific agent that might have contained parabens
was identified.
verhaeghe and dooms-goossens (1997) reported a case of
a 14-year-old female with a 5-year history of recurrent eczema
on the palms and between the fingers. patch testing had been
positive to nickel sulfate and paraben-mix. sources of the reactions appeared to include a toy play gel, water paints, topical
medication, and a sunscreen. a list of paraben-free cosmetics
and topical medications was provided, but the patient was back
a week later after using a liquid soap that was not mentioned on
the list, and turned out to contain parabens.
cooper and shaw (1998) reported a case of allergic contact
dermatitis from parabens in a tar shampoo. a 74-year-old female
presented with a 4-year history of dry, flaky scalp, diagnosed as
pityriasis amianticea. after initially tolerating a tar shampoo,
she reported severe itching and erythema of the face and scalp,
with eyelid edema. the ingredient list on the shampoo included
parabens. patch testing revealed positive reactions to balsam of
peru and paraben mix. further testing showed positive results
with ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben. the authors noted that
an allergic contact dermatitis from parabens in a shampoo was
unusual.

66

cosmetic ingredient review

mowad (2000) presented two case reports of allergic contact dermatitis caused by parabens. in addition, the author
commented on paraben allergenicity, patch testing issues, and
paraben paradoxes. one case report involved a 76-year-old
woman with a long history of eczema (from childhood) who
presented with an exacerbation of the rash on her face and
neck. patch testing revealed a positive reaction to paraben-mix.
on discontinuation of paraben-containing products and use of
paraben-free products, she cleared considerably. the other case
report was a 40-year-old woman with no significant medical
history who presented with a hand rash that had persisted for 2
years. patch testing revealed a positive reaction to paraben-mix.
a review of product usage revealed a moisturizer with parabens.
with discontinuation of the product and avoidance of parabencontaining moisturizers, her hands cleared. she was able to use
paraben-containing cosmetics (other than hand creams or cosmetics that are applied by hand, presumably) without difficulty.
the author noted the same paradoxes that fisher described
in his frequent articles, but went on to mention the issue of conflicting reports of cross-reactions among parabens and the socalled para group, which includes p-aminobenzoic acid (paba)
and p-phenylenediamine. for practical purposes, this author
suggests that cross-reactions are not seen between parabens
and para compounds. overall, the author concluded that allergic contact dermatitis to parabens does occur, but given the
widespread use of parabens, it is relatively uncommon (mowad
2000).
shaffer et al. (2000) reported the case of a 53-year-old female
complaining that her large port-wine stain had recently become
more irregular and thickened. prior dermabrasion had been unsuccessful and the patient was relying on cover-up cosmetics
for aesthetic purposes. pulse dye laser treatment initially lightened the stain and treatments were continued. after the fourth
month of laser therapy, the patient developed an itchy, erythematous, papular eruption on the left side of her face following
each treatment. progressive and more extensive eruptions occurred after subsequent laser treatments involving untreated areas. patch testing showed positive reactions to balsam of peru,
neomycin sulfate, paraben-mix, and several cover-up cosmetics, of which parabens were believed to be relevant to the current extensive eruption. all of the cover-up cosmetics contained
parabens. the authors noted that reports of laser-associated contact dermatitis are becoming more common.
vilaplana (2000) reported a case of a 62-year-old male who
developed contact dermatitis from parabens used as preservatives in eyedrops. the patient had used eyedrops containing
methyl- and propylparaben for 1 year. at 11 months, he developed conjunctivitis and eyelid dermatitis. patch testing was
positive to the eyedrops and to paraben-mix. the eyedrops were
negative in 25 control individuals. the patient was patch-tested
1 month later with methyl- and propylparaben at 3% in petrolatum and was positive to both, whereas the 25 controls were
negative.

clinical treatment
propylparaben
ritzau and swangsilpa (1977) studied the prophylactic effect of propylparaben on alveolitis sicca dolorosa (asd). each
of 45 patients received three tablets containing 33 mg propylparaben or a placebo in the socket immediately after removal of
a mandibular third molar. none of the patients receiving propylparaben developed asd, whereas 24% of the placebo group did.
the prophylactic effect of propylparaben was highly significant,
and no side effects to treatment were reported.
epidemiology
mirick et al. (2002) reported a population based case-control
study of breast cancer patients. the stated purpose of the study
was to address the internet rumor that antiperspirant use causes
breast cancer. women (20 to 74 years of age) with breast cancer
first diagnosed between november 1992 and march 1995 were
compared to control subjects identified by random digit dialing and matched by 5-year age groups. an in person interview
was used to gather information on a large number of past exposures of interest. during the development of the questionnaire,
the authors became aware of the internet rumor that antiperspirants might contain harmful substances that could be absorbed
via small nicks or abrasions caused by underarm shaving. the
authors added a two-stage question to address this hypothesis.
individuals were first asked if they regularly shaved under their
arms, and if the answer was yes, they were asked if they applied any product to control underarm perspiration, which products were used, and if the products were applied within 1 h of
shaving.
several measures of antiperspirant use were used, including
ever/never regular use, exclusive use of antiperspirant (versus
deodorant or talc), and application within 1 h of shaving. these
three measures were captured for deodorant use as well. other
analyses included the use of a blade razor (nonelectric). of the
eligible cases, 813 (78%) agreed to participate. of the controls,
793 (75%) agreed.
nearly all case patients and control subjects had at some point
in their life used at least one method of underarm hair removal
(94% of cases and 93% of controls), with the most common
method being razor shaving. of the subjects who reported underarm hair removal, case patients were less likely than control subjects to have used antiperspirant regularly (50% versus
56%), exclusively (24% versus 26%), or to report application
of antiperspirant within 1 h (36% versus 40%). there was no
association between any of the three measures of antiperspirant
use and the risk of breast cancer.
deodorant use was more prevalent than antiperspirant use.
of the subjects who reported underarm hair removal, case patients were more likely than control subjects to have used deodorant regularly (71% versus 65%), exclusively (43% versus
38%), or to report application of antiperspirant within 1 hour
(49% versus 43%). there was no association between any of

parabens

the three measures of deodorant use and the risk of breast
cancer.
for both antiperspirant and deodorant use, the use of a blade
razor was separately evaluated versus other methods of underarm
hair removal and in subjects who used a blade razor and applied
antiperspirant or deodorant within 1 h of shaving. in no case was
there an association of any of these behaviors with the risk of
breast cancer (mirick et al. 2002).
cosmetics industry complaint experience
the cosmetics industry provided information on cosmetic
product complaints. there were three safety-related complaints
(one each listed under “allergy,” “burning sensation,” and “pimple rash”) with an estimated 18.4 million total uses of a body
scrub product, two suntan lotions, a hand lotion, and a bubble
bath, each containing 0.2 % methylparaben (ctfa 1981s).
complaint experience data on a protective face cream containing 0.2 % propylparaben shows three safety-related complaints in 3 years with an estimated 400,000 uses (ctfa 1981t).
two of these were listed as ”allergy” and one as “burning sensation.”
there were 35 safety-related complaints for a mascara containing both 0.2 % methylparaben and 0.1 % propylparaben with
4.6 million units sold: 20 “burning/stinging,” 11 “irritated skin,”
and 4 “allergic reaction” (ctfa 1981u).
an aftershave lotion also containing 0.2% methylparaben
and 0.1% propylparaben had one safety-related complaint with
170,000 sold (ctfa 1981v).
complaint experience data on a mascara containing 0.2%
butylparaben shows 36 complaints with 2.3 million units sold;
33 of these were listed as “irritating/burning,” 2 as “itching,” and
1 “swelling” (ctfa 1981w).
other parabens safety reviews/assessments
methylparaben
soni et al. (2002) published a safety assessment of methylparaben, covering cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical uses.
based on a noael of 5500 mg/kg day−1 in rats and applying a
factor of 10 for interspecies differences and 10 for intraspecies
differences, the authors concluded that an increase in the adi
to 55 mg/kg day−1 for methylparaben is justified.
propylparaben
soni et al. (2001) published a safety assessment of propylparaben, covering cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical uses.
based on a noael of 5500 mg/kg day−1 in a 96-week feeding
study using rats, and applying a factor of 100 for the extrapolation of this value from rats to humans, the authors recommend
an increase in the current adi from 10 to 55 mg/kg day−1 .
multiple parabens
the european food safety authority (efsa) scientific panel
on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials
in contact with food adopted an opinion on the safety of paraben

67

usage in food (efsa 2004). the opinion noted the earlier adi
of 0 to 10 mg/kg body weight, as the sum of methyl, ethyl, and
propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters and their sodium salts.
the panel evaluated newly available developmental toxicity
studies on methylparaben in rats, mice, hamsters, and rabbits
and found no evidence of developmental toxicity at the highest
dose level of 300 mg/kg day−1 in rabbits or 550 mg/kg day−1
in rodents. proliferative effects of parabens on rat forestomach
cells were discounted as a threshold phenomenon and that human
exposure resulting from use of parabens as food preservatives
would be much below threshold levels.
while acknowledging estrogenic activity for parabens in
vitro, the panel cited the absence of estrogenic activity in vivo
in classical uterotrophic assays using peroral or subcutaneous
injections. the opinion did note that there were positive in
vivo uterotrophic assay findings for butylparaben and isobutylparaben, but that these were not used as food preservatives. phydroxybenzoic acid was not considered estrogenic.
for reproductive toxicity, the opinion cited reduction in daily
sperm production in juvenile male rats fed propylparaben at
10 mg/kg day−1 as the lowest observed adverse effect dose (even
though no lower doses were tested) and contrasted these findings
with the absence of effect for methylparaben and ethylparaben
at doses up to 1000 mg/kg day−1 .
the opinion restated the adi of 0 to 10 mg/kg day−1 for the
sum of methylparaben and ethylparaben. the opinion stated
that propylparaben should not be included in the adi, but failed
to recommend an alternative adi because of the lack of a clear
noael (efsa 2004).
cantox health sciences international (2004) prepared an
assessment of the endocrine disrupting/estrogenic potential of
parabens. this assessment noted that parabens do not have genotoxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic potential and are rapidly hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and excreted. they cited the
same developmental toxicity data noted by the efsa above for
methylparaben and ethylparaben and additional data in support
of the absence of developmental toxicity for butylparaben.
the remainder of the assessment focused on endocrine disruption. the assessment noted that parabens are able to bind
estrogen and androgen receptors, activate estrogen-responsive
genes, stimulate cellular proliferation, and increase levels of  xxxg730xxx  protein. to place the in vitro data in context,
the assessment cited the comparisons of parabens activity with
17beta-estradiol and des (2 to 5 orders of magnitude lower) and
phytoestrogens, including isoflavones (comparable or less).
in vivo uterotrophic assay findings depended on which
paraben, dose, and route of administration. p-hydroxybenzoic
acid was positive using mice in one laboratory at 5 mg/kg day−1
(subcutaneous) and negative in mice and rats in another laboratory at doses up to 100 mg/kg day−1 (oral or subcutaneous).
methylparaben was negative in rats and mice with oral and
subcutaneous doses up to 100 mg/kg day−1 . ethylparaben and
propylparaben were negative by both routes of administration
at that dose, but were positive subcutaneously (but not orally)

68

cosmetic ingredient review

starting at 400 mg/kg day−1 . isobutylparaben increased uterine
weights at estimated subcutaneous doses of ≥100 mg/kg day−1 .
again the assessment compared the findings for parabens with
estradiol and found parabens to be 1000- to 10,000-fold less effective on a equimolar basis and the doses at which there were
any positive findings were well above an estimated exposure to
parabens of 1.3 mg/kg day−1 .
the assessment acknowledged increases or decreases in
testes, epididymides, or prostate weights in male animals exposed to butylparaben and propylparaben and lower sperm
counts in rats and mice exposed to butylparaben and in rats
exposed to propylparaben, but discounted these effects as without pattern or dose-response.
because skin and hair care products may be used on infants
and children at concentrations up to 0.33%, a separate exposure analysis was performed. a range was determined between
estimated dermal absorption values of 30% and 100%. the exposure estimate was adjusted by a factor of 1.7 to account for
the difference between the surface/weight ratio of adults compared to children less than 1 year of age. the daily systemic
exposure from cosmetic products used on infants and children
ranged from 0.26 to 0.87 mg/kg day−1 (cantox health sciences
international 2004).
golden et al. (2005) reviewed the endocrine activity of
parabens and addressed the implications for risks to human
health. these authors noted the reported effects, which include
estrogenic activity in vitro, increased uterine weights, and male
reproductive effects, and commented that not every effect is
seen for every paraben. in addition, they noted that these estrogen active compounds exhibit activity that is several orders
of magnitude less than that of estrogen itself. they argued that
both the dose of endocrine active chemicals and their potency
should be considered in attempting to extrapolate the findings
to human health and that comparisons with existing human data
are the most relevant.
these authors noted the considerable dose-response data in
both humans and animals that demonstrate the effects in offspring of in utero exposure to  xxxd1880xxx  (des). des
is a synthetic estrogenic compound known to be equal or more
potent than estradiol. using a human noel of 0.3 mg/kg day−1
for adverse effects on the male reproductive tract, a comparison was made to the lowest doses of butylparaben and propylparaben linked to decreased sperm production, 10 and 12 mg/kg
day−1 , respectively. potency comparisons were not possible because the male reproductive tract studies were not performed
with estradiol as a positive control. using the potency estimates
from uterotrophic assays, it was determined that butylparaben
is at least 6000-fold below the dose of des that might cause effects on the male reproductive tract. then, based on an estimated
daily dermal dose of 0.12 to 0.41 mg/kg day−1 of butylparaben,
the intake by pregnant women would be 15,000- to 50,000-fold
below the equivalent amount of des that may cause effects on
the embryonic reproductive tract.

these authors also provided a perspective on potential risk
of endocrine active chemicals such as parabens by comparing
them to the daily intake of naturally occurring phytoestrogens.
they described a hygiene-based margin of safety (hbmos) as
the estimated daily intakes weighted by the relative potency of
the compound in question divided by the daily intake of a reference compound. the approach was developed for compounds
with short half-lives, similar in concept to the rapid metabolism
of parabens and dietary phytoestrogens. a daily exposure of 1
mg/kg day−1 of the phytoestrogen, daidzein, was combined with
a marginal uterotrophic assay response to daidzein at 500 mg/kg
day−1 to establish an exposure level considered to be nonhazardous; this became an hbmos value of 1. to calculate the
hbmos for butylparaben, for example, the daily intake of
daidzein appears in the numerator, divided by the product of the
butylparaben daily intake times the relative potency of butylparaben and daidzein. the butylparaben daily dermal intake
is estimated at 0.12 to 0.41 mg/kg day−1 and the relative potency is 500 mg/kg day−1 for daidzein divided by 1200 mg/kg
day−1 for butylparaben (from routledge et al. 1998). using the
value of 1200 mg/kg day−1 for butylparaben is not comparable to the daidzein value because it is a subcutaneous dose, but
none of the oral doses of butylparaben given in various studies produced a uterotrophic response. the resulting hbmos
ranges between 6 and 20. again, given that the daily consumption of phytoestrogens is not likely to elevate risk, the daily
exposure to butylparaben is up to 20 times less likely to elevate
risk.
two of the authors acknowledge being compensated by
ctfa for preparation of their review and the third noted previous work as a ctfa consultant, but all expressed the view that
the interpretations and conclusions are solely their own (golden
et al. 2005).
the scientific committee on consumer products of the european commission issued an opinion on parabens, underarm cosmetics, and breast cancer (european commission 2005c). they
concluded that there was no breast cancer risk from use of underarm deodorants. more specifically, they addressed breast cancer
risk from underarm deodorants containing parabens. they stated
that the estrogenic potential of parabens was very low, and concluded that there was no breast cancer risk from use of parabencontaining underarm deodorants. this group also issued an opinion on the overall safety of parabens (european commission
2005a). they concluded that methylparaben and ethylparaben
may be safely used in cosmetics at concentrations up to 0.4%.
they stated, however, that the available data were insufficient to
determine if propylparaben, butylparaben, or isobutylparaben
could be used safely in cosmetics. they asked for in vitro percutaneous absorption studies and reproductive and developmental
toxicity studies, with a special focus on the male reproductive
system. in an extended opinion, they added isopropylparaben
to the insufficient group, with the same data needs (european
commission 2005b).

parabens

soni et al. (2005) published a safety assessment of parabens
that summarized their previous reviews (soni et al. 2001, 2002)
of methylparaben and propylparaben and included data on other
parabens. these authors suggest that the estrogenic potential of
parabens to cause reproductive harm in humans is equivocal
and recommend a multigenerational reproduction study using
accepted protocols to resolve the concern.
summary of safety test data for benzyl
alcohol,  xxxd306xxx , and sodium benzoate
these data summaries were considered by the cir expert
panel specifically in evaluating the safety of benzylparaben.
benzyl alcohol (andersen 2001)2
benzyl alcohol is metabolized to  xxxd306xxx , which is
then conjugated with glycine and excreted as hippuric acid. epa
reviews of mouse and rat oral-dosing studies conducted by the
natinal toxicology program (ntp) determined subchronic and
chronic oral reference doses for humans of 1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day,
respectively for benzyl alcohol. earlier, the world health organization (who) established an adi of up to 5 mg/kg for
benzyl alcohol. investigators considered benzyl alcohol to be
a moderate respiratory hazard and toxic when administered by
the parenteral route. benzyl alcohol produced severe irritation
when applied to the skin of nude mice.
in oral-dose teratogenicity studies using mice, benzyl alcohol was negative in one study (550 mg/kg/day), resulted in questionable results in another (750 mg/kg/day), and was a considered a suspect reproductive hazard in the third (750 mg/kg/day
[which epa extrapolated to a human dose of 58 mg/kg/day]).
mutagenicity studies reported both positive and negative results. benzyl alcohol was negative for carcinogenicity when
dermally tested on mice at 2.00% in a nonoxidative hair dye.
ntp considered it negative for carcinogenicity following 2years of oral dosing in rats and mice, but epa considered the
results equivocal.
in clinical settings, benzyl alcohol can produce nonimmunologic contact urticaria or non-immunologic immediate contact
reactions. benzyl alcohol was not a sensitizer when tested in a
maximization test  xxxd1891xxx % in petrolatum, and demonstrated a low
incidence of sensitization in provocation studies. therapeutic
ocular studies indicated that benzyl alcohol may be beneficial
in the management of cataracts.
 xxxd306xxx  and sodium benzoate (andersen 2001)3
 xxxd306xxx  is an  xxxd306xxx  that is used in cosmetics
as a ph adjustor and/or preservative. sodium benzoate is its

sodium salt and is used in cosmetics as a preservative. both substances are gras ingredients. who established an adi of up
to 5 mg/kg.  xxxd306xxx  can be used in ointments and antifungal agents. sodium benzoate has been used clinically in the
treatment of hyperammonemia. the benzoates are recognized
hydroxy radical scavengers.
 xxxd306xxx  is rapidly absorbed following dermal application and its metabolism can deplete glycine supplies.
in animal multiple-dose oral toxicity studies, decreased feed
consumption, depressed growth, and toxic effects were noted at
doses of  xxxd306xxx  or sodium benzoate >1%. a neurobiological study was negative.
in oral-dose teratogenicity studies,  xxxd306xxx  (600 mg/kg)
produced significant results in hamsters, but was negative in two
rat studies (up to at least 500 mg/kg/day). sodium benzoate was
negative for teratogenicity in mice and rats (175 mg/kg/day),
hamsters (300 mg/kg/day), and rabbits (250 mg/kg/day).
 xxxd306xxx  was negative in mutagenicity studies. sodium
benzoate was positive in assays done on the chinese hamster
ovarian (cho) cell line, but negative in other studies. benzoic
acid was negative for carcinogenicity when dermally tested on
mice at 0.016% in a nonoxidative hair dye. sodium benzoate
was negative for carcinogenicity when administered orally at up
to 2% to rats (in feed for up to 2 years) or mice (in a life-time
drinking water study).
in clinical studies, toxic symptoms were noted following
doses far exceeding the adi established by the who. the benzoates are recognized to produce nonimmunologic contact urticaria or nonimmunologic immediate contact reactions, but it is
not clear whether the reactions are histamine- or prostaglandinmediated. dermal sensitization, phototoxicity, and photosensitization studies were negative.

summary of parabens
parabens are esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (phba).
parabens are prepared by esterification of phba with the corresponding alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. parabens
are generally oil soluble and poorly soluble in water. water solubility decreases as the ester chain length increases,
as does the octanol/water partition coefficient. these compounds are stable in air and resist hydrolysis in acid solutions
and under conditions of sterilization. in alkaline solutions,
parabens hydrolyze to phba and the corresponding alcohol. individual parabens and phba are easily separable using
high-performance liquid chromatography and other separation
techniques.
as reported by industry to fda in 2006, parabens are used as
preservatives in over 22,000 cosmetic formulations. this current
use figure is an increase over the 13,282 uses reported to fda
in 1981. they are most commonly used at concentrations up
to 0.8% (mixtures of parabens) or up to 0.4% (single paraben).
industry estimates of the daily use of cosmetic products that
may contain parabens were 17.76 g for adults and 378 mg for

70

cosmetic ingredient review

infants. certain parabens are also used as preservatives in foods,
pharmaceuticals, and other products.
parabens in cosmetic formulations applied to skin penetrate
the stratum corneum in inverse relation to the ester chain length.
carboxylesterases present in keratinocytes hydrolyze parabens
in the skin. the extent of the breakdown to phba is different
between rodent and human skin. in vitro studies also indicate a
difference in the extent of hydrolysis to phba, depending on
whether viable whole skin or dermatomed human skin is used,
with the former having a larger extent of hydrolysis. chemicals
that disrupt the stratum corneum may increase the skin penetration of methylparaben and possibly ethylparaben, but do not
affect the penetration of parabens with longer ester chains.
ingested parabens are quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid, conjugated,
and the conjugate excreted in the urine. data obtained from
chronic administration studies indicate that parabens do not accumulate in the body. serum concentrations of parabens, even after intravenous administration, quickly decline and remain low.
varying amounts of parabens are passed in the feces depending
upon which paraben is administered and the size of the dose.
little or no unchanged paraben is excreted in the urine.
the antimicrobial activity of parabens increases with increasing ester chain length, but water solubility decreases. because
microbial replication takes place primarily in the water phase
of a cosmetic product, preservative effectiveness is a combination of antimicrobial activity and water solubility. parabens are
more active against fungi than bacteria and more active against
gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. parabens are effective within a ph range of 4 to 8. parabens act as microbiostatic
agents by increasing cell wall permeability and thereby disrupting transport. parabens also alter cellular respiration, electron transport, and oxidative enzyme systems of microbes. both
the ester-linkage and the para-hydroxy group of the paraben
molecule have been implicated as active sites.
parabens can bind to proteins and, depending on the enzyme system, may inhibit and potentiate enzyme activity. they
also compete with bilirubin for binding sites on  xxxg124xxx .
parabens can inhibit growth of cultures of animal and human
cells, depending on concentration, and reduce biosynthesis of
rna and dna in both bacterial and mammalian cell cultures.
one study using human keratinocytes found that methylparaben
can potentiate the effects of uv radiation, but it was unclear
that the wavelengths involved would be found in sunlight at the
earth’s surface.
parabens have varying physiological and pharmacological
effects. parabens have been reported to have anticonvulsive, vasodilating, analgesic, and anesthetic effects in animals.
acute toxicity studies in animals indicate that parabens are
practically nontoxic by various routes of administration. methylparaben (100% and 10%), propylparaben (10%), and ethylparaben (100% and 10%) were, at most, mildly irritating when
applied to rabbit skin. benzylparaben applied directly (0.5 g)
to rabbit skin produced no significant irritation. methylparaben

and ethylparaben at 100% concentration were slightly irritating when instilled into the eyes of rabbits, but there were no
adverse reactions to 0.1 g of benzylparaben. subchronic and
chronic oral studies indicate that parabens are practically nontoxic. practically all animal sensitization tests indicate that the
parabens are nonsensitizing.
numerous genotoxicity studies, including ames testing,
dominant lethal assay, host-mediated assay, and cytogenic assays, indicate that the parabens are generally nonmutagenic,
although ethylparaben and methylparaben were judged to induce significant chromosomal aberrations (11.0% and 15.0%
increases, respectively) in an in vitro assay using chinese hamster ovary cells.
ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben in the diet
produced cell proliferation in the forestomach of rats, with
the activity directly related to chain length of the alkyl chain.
isobutylparaben and butylparaben were noncarcinogenic when
given to mice in a chronic feeding study. methylparaben was
noncarcinogenic when injected subcutaneously in mice or rats,
or when administered intravaginally in rats, and was not cocarcinogenic when injected subcutaneously in mice. propylparaben
was noncarcinogenic in a study of transplacental carcinogenesis.
methylparaben was nonteratogenic in rabbits, rats, mice,
and hamsters, and ethylparaben was nonteratogenic in rats.
parabens, even at levels that produce maternal toxicity, do not
produce terata in animal studies. one study examined the developmental toxicity of butylparaben in rats and reported no effect
on development up to an oral dose of 1000 mg/kg day−1 , even
with some maternal toxicity at that dose. the maternal toxicity
noael dose was 100 mg/kg day−1 .
parabens have been extensively studied to evaluate male reproductive toxicity. in one in vitro study, sperm viability was
eliminated by concentrations as low as 6 mg/ml methylparaben,
8 mg/ml ethylparaben, 3 mg/ml propylparaben, or 1 mg/ml
butylparaben, but an in vivo study of 0.1% or 1.0% methylparaben or ethylparaben in the diet of mice reported no spermatotoxic effects. propylparaben did affect sperm counts at all levels from 0.01% to 1.0%. epididymis and seminal vesicle weight
decreases were reported in rats given a 1% oral butylparaben
dose; and decreased sperm number and motile activity in f1
offspring of rats maternally exposed to 100 mg/kg day−1 were
reported. decreased sperm numbers and activity were reported
in f1 offspring of female rats exposed to butylparaben at 100 or
200 mg/kg day−1 , but there were no abnormalities in the reproductive organs.
methylparaben was studied using rats at levels in the diet up
to 10000 ppm (estimated mean dose of 1141.1 mg/kg day−1 )
with no adverse effects. butylparaben was studied using rats
at levels in the diet up to 10000 ppm (estimated mean dose
of 1087.6 mg/kg day−1 ) in a repeat of the study noted above,
but using a larger number of animals and a staging analysis of
testicular effects. no adverse reproductive effects were found.
butylparaben binds to estrogen receptors in isolated rat uteri,
with an affinity orders of magnitude less than natural estradiol.

parabens

the estrogenic effect of parabens has been estimated by their
competitive binding to the human estrogen receptors alpha and beta.
with des binding affinity set at 100, the relative binding affinity of the parabens increased as a function of chain length from
not detectable for methylparaben to 0.267 ± 0.027 for human
 xxxg730xxx  alpha and 0.340 ± 0.031 for human  xxxg730xxx  beta for isobutylparaben. in a study of  xxxg183xxx 
binding, propylparaben exhibited weak competitive binding, but
methylparaben had no binding effect at all.
parabens and phba have been studied in several uterotrophic
assays. phba at 5 mg/kg day−1 (s.c.) was reported to produce
an estrogenic response in one uterotrophic assay using mice,
but there was no response in another study using rats (s.c. up to
5 mg/kg day−1 ) and mice (s.c. up to 100 mg/kg day−1 ) and in a
study using rats (s.c. up to 100 mg/kg day−1 ).
methylparaben failed to produce any effect in uterotrophic
assays in two laboratories, but did produce an effect in other
studies from another laboratory. the potency of methylparaben
was 1000 to 20000 less when compared to natural estradiol.
the same pattern was reported for ethylparaben, propylparaben,
and butylparaben when potency was compared to natural estradiol; in positive studies the potency of ethylparaben was 346 to
25000 less; the potency of propylparaben was 1612 to 20000
less; and the potency of butylparaben was 436 to 16,666
less. in two studies, isobutylparaben did produce an estrogenic response in the uterotrophic assay, but the potency was
240,000 to 4,000,000 less than estradiol. in one study, benzylparaben produced an estrogenic response in the uterotrophic
assay, but the potency was 330,000 to 3,300,000 less than
estradiol.
estrogenic activity of parabens and phba was increased in
human breast cancer cells in vitro, but the increases were around
4 orders of magnitude less than that of estradiol.
several overviews of the endocrine disruption (estrogenic and
androgenic effects) generally note that any effect of parabens is
weak.
parabens are practically nonirritating and nonsensitizing in
the population with normal skin. paraben sensitization has occurred and continues to be reported in the case literature, however, principally when exposure involves damaged or broken
skin. even when patients with chronic dermatitis are patch-tested
to a parabens mix, parabens generally induce sensitization in
less than 4% of such individuals. many patients sensitized to
paraben-containing medications can wear cosmetics containing
these ingredients with no adverse effects. skin irritation and sensitization tests on product formulations containing from 0.1% to
0.8 % of one or two of the parabens showed no evidence of significant irritation or sensitization potential for these ingredients.
a primary eye irritation study in humans showed methylparaben
to be nonirritating at concentrations up to 0.3%. photocontact
sensitization and phototoxicity tests on product formulations
containing 0.1% to 0.8% methyl-, propyl-, and/or butylparaben
produced no evidence for significant photoreactivity. industry
complaint experience data showed low to moderate numbers of

71

safety-related complaints, with the incidence depending on the
product.
several safety assessments of parabens have been prepared.
one such assessment for propylparaben in foods recommended
an increase in the current adi from 10 to 55 mg/kg day−1 and
another on methylparaben concluded that an increase in the adi
to 55 mg/kg day−1 for methylparaben is justified.
the european food safety authority opinion cited reduction in daily sperm production in juvenile male rats fed propylparaben  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg day−1 as the lowest observable adverse effect dose and contrasted these findings with the absence of effect
for methylparaben and ethylparaben at doses up to 1000 mg/kg
day−1 . the opinion restated the adi of 0 to 10 mg/kg day−1 for
the sum of methylparaben and ethylparaben. the opinion stated
that propylparaben should not be included in the adi, and failed
to recommend an alternative adi because of the lack of a clear
noael.
another assessment of the endocrine disrupting/estrogenic
potential of parabens noted that parabens do not have genotoxic,
carcinogenic, or teratogenic potential and are rapidly hydrolyzed
to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and excreted. this assessment noted
that parabens are able to bind estrogen and androgen receptors,
activate estrogen-responsive genes, stimulate cellular proliferation, and increase levels of  xxxg730xxx  protein. to place
the in vitro data in context, the assessment cited the comparisons
of parabens activity with 17beta-estradiol and des (2 to 5 orders
of magnitude lower) and phytoestrogens, including isoflavones
(comparable or less). this assessment acknowledged increases
or decreases in testes, epididymides, or prostate weights in male
animals exposed to butylparaben and propylparaben and lower
sperm counts in rats and mice exposed to butylparaben and in
rats exposed to propylparaben, but discounted these effects as
without pattern or dose-response.

discussion
as previously considered, available acute, subchronic, and
chronic toxicity tests, using a range of exposure routes, demonstrate a low order of parabens’ toxicity at concentrations that
would be used in cosmetics.
parabens are rarely irritating or sensitizing to normal human skin at concentration used in cosmetics. some individuals,
however, may develop allergic reactions to parabens. the expert panel is aware of the “paraben paradox” in which parabensensitive patients who react with allergic contact dermatitis when
paraben-containing pharmaceuticals are applied to eczematous
or ulcerated skin can tolerate paraben-containing cosmetics applied to normal, unbroken skin. no reaction is induced even
when these cosmetics contact the thin, delicate membrane of
the eyelid. clinical patch testing data available over the past
20 years demonstrate no significant change in the overall portion of dermatitis patients that test positive for parabens.
although parabens do penetrate the stratum corneum and are
available for distribution throughout the body, the expert panel

cosmetic ingredient review

noted that metabolism of parabens takes place within viable skin.
although the extent of this metabolism is different in different
reports, the expert panel believes that a conservative estimate
of 50% penetration of unmetabolized parabens may be used to
compare exposures with adverse effects levels. the metabolism
of parabens in the skin is likely to result in as low as 1% of
unmetabolized parabens available for absorption into the body.
the expert panel considered that the most important new
data available for assessing the safety of parabens as used in
cosmetics are those data generally in the category of endocrine
disruption, but which include male reproductive toxicity and various estrogenic activity studies. the expert panel believes that
the available data demonstrate that parabens are, at most, weakly
estrogenic. for example, the binding efficiency of parabens with
estrogen receptors is around 4 orders of magnitude lower than
estradiol.
the cir expert panel compared exposures to parabens resulting from use of cosmetic products to a no observed adverse
effect level (noael). if that exposure is lower than the level
shown to have no effect, then safety may be inferred.
the cir expert panel selected a noael of 1000 mg/kg
day−1 based on the most statistically powerful and wellconducted study of the effects of butylparabens on the male
reproductive system. the panel did note the several studies in
which spermatotoxic effects were noted at lower doses. in the
expert panel’s experience, studies of sperm counts are particularly unreliable and evaluation of reproductive organs is a much
more reliable and reproducible indicator. the benchmark study
noted above included a careful staging analysis of reproductive
organ damage, which was likely to detect even subtle forms of
damage.
the expert panel acknowledged that one study has reported
estrogenic activity in the uterotrophic assay system of the
paraben metabolite, phba. three other studies did not detect
any estrogenic activity. in considering the benchmark end point
of male reproductive effects, the expert panel noted that the
available animal studies of methylparaben and ethylparaben
(parabens with the shortest ester side chains) have demonstrated
an absence of an effect, so it is considered unlikely that phba
has any significant estrogenic activity.
the cir expert panel considered exposures to cosmetic
products containing a single paraben preservative (use level of
0.4%) separately from products containing multiple parabens
(use level of 0.8%). the cir expert panel recognized that industry survey data indicate lower use concentrations in products for infant use, and that use levels in many adult products
will be lower, but these values are conservative for purposes of
determining if there is any possibility of adverse effect. adult
(60 kg body weight) use of cosmetic products was estimated
to be 17.76 g per day and infant (4.5 kg) use of cosmetic
products was estimated to be 378 mg per day. infants were
separately considered because they would be a sensitive subpopulation for any agent capable of causing male reproductive
effects.

based on the available data demonstrating the metabolism
of parabens in the human body and the absence of any tissue
accumulation over time, the expert panel considered that infant
exposure to parabens via breast-feeding was unlikely and that
the only exposure of infants to parabens from cosmetic products
would be from direct product use.
for adults, the relevant calculations are:
systemic dose (single paraben) = 17.76 g/day of product
×0.4% use concentration ÷ 60 kg person × 50% absorption
×1000 mg/kg = 0.59 mg/kg day−1
systemic dose (multiple parabens) = 17.76 g/day of product
×0.8% use concentration ÷ 60 − kg person
×50% absorption × 1000 mg/kg = 1.18 mg/kg day−1
for infants, the relevant calculations are:
systemic dose (single paraben) = 378 mg/day of product
×0.4% use concentration ÷ 4.5 − kg infant × 50% absorption
= 0.168 mg/kg day−1
systemic dose (multiple parabens) = 378 mg/day of product
×0.8% use concentration ÷ 4.5 kg infant × 50% absorption
= 0.336 mg/kg day−1
based on these systemic doses and the noael for butylparaben of 1000 mg/kg day−1 , a margin of safety (mos) may
be determined by dividing the noael by the systemic dose to
yield the mos values shown in table 33.
the expert panel considers that these mos determinations
are conservative and likely represent an overestimate of the possibility of an adverse effect (e.g., use concentrations may be
lower, penetration may be less). as presented, the mos over
the level demonstrated to produce no adverse male reproductive
toxicity is around 3 orders of magnitude or greater. the cir
expert panel considers this mos adequate to assure the safety
of cosmetic products in which these preservatives are used.
conclusion
the cir expert panel concluded that methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, isopropylparaben, butylparaben,

parabens

isobutylparaben, and benzylparaben are safe as cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and use concentrations described
in this safety assessment.
