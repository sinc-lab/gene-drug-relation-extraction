abstract
objective: it has been suggested that both pacing and treatment with  xxxd2635xxx  may reduce torsade de pointes (tdp) arrhythmias in
patients with  xxxg2028xxx  ( xxxg2028xxx ), but it is not fully understood how these interventions could prevent tdp. we therefore studied
the effects of pacing and  xxxd2635xxx  in mice with a heterozygous knock-in dkpq scn5ad / 1 deletion ( xxxg2028xxx -tg), a murine  xxxg2028xxx 
model. methods: three right and left ventricular monophasic action potentials (maps) were simultaneously recorded in langendorffperfused hearts of  xxxg2028xxx -tg and wild type (wt) littermates. av block was induced, and pacing was performed at baseline and during
 xxxd2635xxx  infusion (4 mg / ml). map recordings were analysed for action potential duration (apd), apd dispersion, and early
afterdepolarisations (eads) and related to spontaneous arrhythmias. results: after inducing av block,  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts were
bradycardic [ xxxg2028xxx -tg 532660 vs. wt 284648 ms cycle length (cl, mean6s.e.m., p,0.05(*))]. eads occurred in 16 / 18, and
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (pvt) in 11 / 18  xxxg2028xxx -tg but not in 19 wt.  xxxg2028xxx -tg had longer apd than wt hearts*. at cl
of 200 ms and longer, apd dispersion was higher in  xxxg2028xxx -tg [dispersion (apd70): 1263 ms vs. 562 ms at cl5200 ms*], and
increased to 3564 ms* directly prior to pvt episodes. sudden rate accelerations initially increased apd dispersion due to eads and
apd alternans in  xxxg2028xxx -tg, but pacing then reduced apd dispersion. pacing suppressed (n59 / 9) and prevented (n549 / 50) pvt.
 xxxd2635xxx  shortened apd at long cl*, and suppressed pvt (n54 / 5*), but did not prevent pvt during normal rhythm. conclusions:
bradycardia, increased dispersion of apd and eads provoke ventricular ectopy and pvt in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts. ventricular pacing reduces
apd dispersion, suppresses eads and prevents pvt in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts. these effects provide a pathophysiological rationale for pacing
in  xxxg2028xxx .

1. introduction
mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene  xxxg2028xxx 
can cause  xxxg2028xxx  ( xxxg2028xxx ) [1–3], an inherited
cardiac disorder that prolongs the ventricular action potential and causes sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias,
specifically torsade de pointes (tdp). the disease is
relatively rare but aggressive and can affect patients at an
time for primary review 27 days.

early age, leading even to sudden infant death syndrome
[4–6]. cardiac events are less frequent but more often
lethal than in other forms of long qt syndrome [7].
therefore, clinical experience with the treatment of  xxxg2028xxx 
patients is scarce and therapeutic recommendations concerning drug administration and implantation of pacemaker
or defibrillator devices are discussed controversially.
in  xxxg2028xxx , tdp is known to occur preferably at rest [8].
 xxxg2028xxx  patients may suffer from resting bradycardia in
addition to prolonged repolarisation [9,10], and some  xxxg1268xxx 
patients, particularly children, develop functional atrioventricular nodal block (av nodal block) immediately before
the onset of tdp [11–13]. prevention of bradycardia has
therefore been suggested as a gene-specific therapy to
prevent tdp in  xxxg2028xxx  [14].
to study the effect of bradycardia and therapeutic
interventions on early afterdepolarisations (eads), ventricular ectopy, and tdp-like ventricular tachyarrhythmias
in  xxxg2028xxx , we studied intact hearts from heterozygous
transgenic mice with a knock-in deletion scn5ad / 1
( xxxg2028xxx -tg) lacking the same kpq residues (lys-1505,
pro-1506, gln-1507 between domains iii and iv in the
sodium channel a-subunit) as  xxxg2028xxx  patients [15–19]. we
measured action potential durations (apd), effective refractory period (erp), dispersion of apd, occurrence of
eads and spontaneous tachyarrhythmias in intact hearts
after av nodal block and during ventricular pacing with
and without administration of the sodium channel blocking
drug  xxxd2635xxx .

a vertical langendorff apparatus (hugo sachs, marchhugstetten, germany) ensuring a perfusion pressure at
10065 mmhg and a coronary flow of 461 ml / min.
a 2.0 french octapolar mouse electrophysiologic catheter with 0.5 mm electrodes spaced at 0.5 mm (cib’er
mouse, numed, hopkinton, ny, usa) was inserted
into the right atrium and right ventricle (rv) and twisted
toward the rv septum for pacing and recording of intracardiac electrograms. ecg recordings were obtained from
ag–agcl electrodes immersed in superfused sponges
flanking the isolated heart. signals were amplified and
filtered by an ecg amplifier at a bandwidth of 0.1 to 300
hz (hugo sachs). three monophasic action potentials
(maps) were continuously and simultaneously recorded
from the right and left ventricular (lv) epicardium. stable
map recordings were obtained by miniaturised map
catheters mounted on custom-made spring-loaded electrode
holders ensuring perpendicular application of the electrode
tip and constant electrode contact pressure [20]. recording
positions were at an equal distance from the ventricular
base. maps were stable for more than 30 min and
reproducible for more than 2 h of recording. map
recordings were preamplified using a dc-coupled preamplifier (model 2000, ep technologies, san jose, ca,
usa). all preamplified signals were digitised and stored
using a custom-made semi-automatic software [21]
adapted for analysis of murine repolarisation [22,20].

2.2. protocols
2. methods

2.1. isolated heart setup
studies were carried out according to institutional
guidelines and approved by the institutional animal care
and use committee. the study adhered to the guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals published by the us
national institute of health (nih publication no. 85-23,
revised 1996). the experimental setup has been described
before [20]. in brief, transgenic mice expressing the mutant
dkpq  xxxg2028xxx  gene causing  xxxg2028xxx  in patients (scn5atg) [19] and their wildtype (wt) littermates were anaesthetised using urethane (2 g / kg) and a digital six-lead
ecg was recorded for 10 s (corina, ge hellige
marquette medical systems, freiburg, germany, software
custom-adapted for murine ecg). the heart was excised
via a median thoracotomy and immediately immersed in
warm and oxygenated buffer. the aorta was cannulated
and retrogradely perfused with 37 8c krebs–henseleit
buffer containing (in mmol / l): nacl 118; nahco 3 24.88;
kh 2 po 41.18; glucose 5.55; na-pyruvate 2; mgso 4 0.83;
 xxxg2125xxx  2 1.8; kcl 4.7. the buffer was equilibrated with a
95% o 2 –5% co 2 gas mixture. the heart was mounted on

after an equilibration period of 10 min to verify stability
of the preparation, signal quality, and intrinsic rhythm, the
av node was ablated by applying gentle pressure at the
septal portion of the anulus fibrosus by a pair of surgical
tweezers. av nodal block was confirmed by discordant
atrial and ventricular activity in the ecg. the spontaneous
ventricular rhythm was observed for 10 min, followed by
rv constant pacing via the octapolar catheter at physiological rates [100–200 ms cycle length (cl)] and bradycardic
rates (300–600 ms cl). when pacing was stopped, pauses
were observed [23,20]. when spontaneous arrhythmias
occurred, we performed ventricular pacing (100–600 ms
pacing cl) or added  xxxd2635xxx  (4 mg / ml perfusate) to
suppress arrhythmias, followed by a wash-out period to
confirm re-occurrence of arrhythmias. furthermore, sudden
rate accelerations were performed by ventricular pacing in
steps from 600 to 200 ms pacing cl and from 400 and 300
to 100 ms pacing cl. pacing was continued until steady
state was reached. the erp was determined by programmed stimulation using trains of eight s1 stimuli and 2
ms decrements of the extra stimulus, s2. all erp measurements were repeated to ensure reproducibility. the protocols were performed at baseline and with  xxxd2635xxx  at a
concentration of 4 mg / ml.

2.3. map measurements
data were manually reviewed using an adapted version
of a previously published map analysis program [21].
apd at 50, 70, and 90% repolarisation was analysed
manually and via the map analysis program [21]. map
signal quality criteria included the following specific
features: stable baseline and map morphology, fast upstroke without inflection or negative spikes, amplitude .1
mv, and rapid first phase of repolarisation. due to the
typical murine map wave shape of early repolarisation,
0% repolarisation was measured at the peak of the map
upstroke and 100% repolarisation was measured during
electrical diastole [24,22,20]. dispersion of repolarisation
was calculated as the difference between the maximal and
the minimal apd of the three simultaneously recorded
maps. activation time was measured as the delay between
stimulus artefact in the endocardial pacing catheter and the
upstroke of the map. mean activation time was calculated
as the mean interval of the three epicardial maps. the
erp/apd ratio was calculated as the quotient of the
effective refractory period as measured during rv endocardial pacing, and apd90 of the rv map [25]. post
repolarisation refractoriness was calculated as erp minus
apd90 [26].
to quantify the time course of frequency adaptation of
apd after sudden rate accelerations, apd was analysed at
50, 70 and 90% repolarisation in each of the first 100 beats
after sudden rate accelerations.

2.4. evaluation of arrhythmias
all recordings were scrutinised online and offline for
eads, triggered activity, bigemini, triplets, quadruplets
and spontaneous monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (pvt). the arrhythmia cl was measured
offline on a beat per beat basis. arrhythmias were classified as monomorphic, polymorphic, and with or without
fractionated action potentials using map and ecg criteria.
for the purpose of this study, we analysed arrhythmias
during spontaneous rhythm [23,20].

2.5. statistical analysis
statistical analysis was carried out using a jmp software
package (version 3, sas institute, usa). paired and
unpaired t-tests, univariate analysis of variance (anova)
analyses and anova analyses for multiple comparisons
and repetitive measurements were used for comparison of
continuous parameters at different cls in wt and
 xxxg2028xxx -tg at baseline and with  xxxd2635xxx . fisher’s exact
test was used to compare arrhythmia occurrence rates.

3. results

3.1. bradycardia, eads and arrhythmias
av nodal block rendered  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts extremely
bradycardic compared to wt [spontaneous ventricular cl
532660 ms (n518  xxxg2028xxx -tg) vs. 284648 ms (n519
wt), p,0.05, fig. 1]. a difference between spontaneous
cl during sinus rhythm was neither detected in vivo
( xxxg2028xxx -tg 13364 ms vs. wt 12565, n512 per group,
p.0.2) nor ex vivo before induction of av nodal block
( xxxg2028xxx -tg 12766 ms vs. wt 13067 ms, p.0.2, n55
per group). after inducing av nodal block, eads occurred
in 16, and repetitive ventricular ectopy and pvt in 11 of
18  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts with av nodal block, but not in 19
wt hearts (figs. 1 and 2, p,0.05). eads occurred in all
three recording sites, but more often in the rv (13 / 16
hearts) compared to lv free wall (4 / 16 hearts) and lv
septum (3 / 16 hearts) as well as compared to lv free wall
and septum together (p,0.05). eads and triggered ectopy
only developed after av nodal block, and preferably at
long intrinsic cls (.600 ms): episodes of pvt were
preceded by a pause of more than 1000 ms in 10 / 11 hearts
with pvt. mean cl during the first half of the arrhythmia
was 13767 ms (n511 hearts) and shorter than the atrial
cls at the time of arrhythmias (fig. 2b). during pvt,
maps were fractionated and the qrs axis in the ecg was
changing (fig. 2b). prolongation of cl and a lesser degree
of fractionation of maps and ecg preceded spontaneous
termination of the arrhythmia (fig. 2a and b). episodes of
pvt lasted 7.060.6 s (range from 3.8 to 9.4 s, n511
hearts). usually, pvt occurred in repetitive episodes
separated by pauses of more than 1000 ms.

3.2. action potential prolongation and bradycardiadependent increased dispersion
steady-state apd was prolonged in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts
during fix frequent pacing at pacing cls from 100 to 400
ms (fig. 1). during steady-state pacing, mean map
duration was not significantly different between recording
sites, although dispersion was present in individual hearts.
only at long pacing cycle lengths of 200 ms and more,
dispersion of apd was increased in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts
(fig. 1). directly prior to the pause preceding pvt, apd
(apd70: 11765 ms vs. 5161 ms, p,0.05, all values
measured in the five beats directly prior to pvt episodes
versus five consecutive beats during spontaneous rhythm
without pvt) and apd dispersion (dispersion of apd70:
3564 ms vs. 1361 ms, p,0.05) were further increased in
 xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts during spontaneous rhythm when com-

1088

pared to values during spontaneous rhythm without pvt.
ventricular cycle length was also increased directly prior to
pvt episodes (654686 ms prior to tdp vs. 466633 ms in
 xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts without tdp, p50.04).

3.3. effect of pacing
rv pacing completely suppressed eads and pvt in
nine of nine hearts when it was begun during a period of
repetitive pvt. pacing at cls of 100–200 ms cl was
more potent than pacing at longer cls from 300 to 600
ms. ventricular pacing at constant cls also prevented pvt
episodes when pacing was begun before pvt occurrence
(no pvt episodes during constant pacing at 100–200 ms
cl in 49 / 50  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts). pacing was so effective
in preventing arrhythmia episodes that we avoided pauses
in the pacing protocols in order to complete them without
occurrence of pvt.
during the first beats after sudden rate accelerations,
eads and regional apd alternans developed in 9 / 18
 xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts (fig. 3a–c), and temporarily resulted
in enhanced dispersion of repolarisation (fig. 3d). however, apd and apd dispersion decreased progressively
during sustained rapid pacing and reached a steady state
below the values measured for the long cl (fig. 3).

and septal lv, but not on the lv free wall. after the fourth beat, a
premature beat is elicited, probably initiated by an ead in the rv. the
premature beat is conducted to the lv free wall and appears to turn back
to the rv (re-entry). (c) mean action potential duration (apd) and apd

differences to a cycle length of 100 ms. apd50 and apd90 showed
similar differences.

during steady state pacing,  xxxd2635xxx  (4 mg / ml) shortened apd in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts at long pacing cls (400
and 600 ms, fig. 4a). at short pacing cls, in contrast,
apd was not significantly altered (fig. 4a).  xxxd2635xxx 
thereby decreased the difference between the longest and
the shortest steady-state apd from 53 to 26 ms at 70%
repolarisation (fig. 4a, p,0.05).  xxxd2635xxx  furthermore
decreased the occurrence of apd alternans and eads
during sudden rate accelerations. transient prolongation of
apd was attenuated by  xxxd2635xxx : during the first 50
beats after a sudden rate acceleration from 600 to 200 ms
cl, apd at 50, 70 and 90% repolarisation was shorter in
rv and lv maps with  xxxd2635xxx  when compared to
baseline (e.g., apd70  xxxd2635xxx  vs. baseline: rv map
3660.3 vs. 52.960.4, lv free wall 54.860.2 vs. 65.160.3
ms, lv septum 41.760.2 vs. 60.260.4 ms, all p,0.05).
during the following 50 beats (beat 51–100 after the rate
acceleration), apd further shortened both at baseline and
with  xxxd2635xxx  (apd70 baseline: rv map 44.260.6*,
lv free wall 46.561.0, lv septum 45.260.7* ms; apd70

 xxxd2635xxx  prolonged the erp at twice diastolic pacing
threshold from 5566 to 91611 ms at a pacing cl of 200
ms (p,0.05), resulting in an increase of the erp/apd
ratio from 0.7760.06 to 1.1460.14 (p,0.05) and in post

did not reach significance (prr: wt at baseline
27.468.1, wt with  xxxd2635xxx  21.667.6). activation
times were increased by  xxxd2635xxx  in wt (data not
shown) and  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts, especially at short pacing
cls (fig. 4b). furthermore,  xxxd2635xxx  aggravated the
intrinsic bradycardia in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts and increased
the pacing threshold from 1.360.1 to 2.060.3 ma (p,
0.05).
when given during periods of pvt,  xxxd2635xxx  suppressed arrhythmias in 4 / 5  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts. when given
before the onset of pvt,  xxxd2635xxx  did not completely
prevent episodes of pvt: in 5 / 10  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts in
whom  xxxd2635xxx  was added to the perfusate to assess
apds, refractory periods and activation times, spontaneous
pvt occurred despite the presence of  xxxd2635xxx  in the
perfusate.

4. discussion

4.1. main findings
in this dkpq  xxxg2028xxx  knock-in mouse heart model of
 xxxg2028xxx , pvt were preceded by slow intrinsic ventricular
rhythm, prolonged apd, increased dispersion of apd, and
eads. transgenic hearts exhibited intrinsic bradycardia

after av nodal block. fix frequent ventricular pacing at
physiological rates prevented bradycardia, reduced apd
and apd dispersion, and completely suppressed eads and
ventricular arrhythmias. sudden rate accelerations resulted
in a transient increase in apd dispersion.  xxxd2635xxx 
partially suppressed arrhythmias, possibly by preventing
apd prolongation at long cls and by producing post
repolarisation refractoriness, but aggravated intrinsic
bradycardia. these data suggest a pathophysiological
rationale for pacing in  xxxg2028xxx .

4.2. altered scn5 a-tg whole-heart electrophysiology
concordant with microelectrode studies, apd was prolonged in intact hearts from  xxxg2028xxx -tg mice [19]. this
effect was more pronounced at long pacing cls, probably
due to the increased late inward sodium current in the
mutant  xxxg2028xxx  channel [27].  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts exhibited
a markedly slowed intrinsic ventricular rhythm after av
nodal block. this may be due to a reduced early sodium
influx or to an increased late sodium influx that could
suppress spontaneous activation in ventricular pacemaker
cells [28]. when bradycardia was present, dispersion of
apd was markedly increased in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts. this
novel finding may be due to regional heterogeneity of the
depolarising current (ina ). increased apd dispersion has
been identified as a proarrhythmic factor in another

l. fabritz et al. / cardiovascular research 57 (2003) 1085–1093

transgenic model of  xxxg1268xxx  [29], and similar proarrhythmic
effects of bradycardia have been reported in a model of
drug induced  xxxg2028xxx  [30]. our data demonstrate that an
increased dispersion of apd contributes to spontaneous
arrhythmias in this transgenic model of  xxxg2028xxx , and that
intrinsic bradycardia aggravates these proarrhythmic effects.

4.3. spontaneous pvt
spontaneous polymorphic ventricular tachycardias
occurred in more than half of  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts after av
block, but not in wt hearts. some characteristics of pvt
are comparable to tdp in  xxxg2028xxx : arrhythmia episodes
occurred after long pauses and were preceded by ead and
enhanced dispersion of apd. arrhythmia episodes were of
polymorphic nature with undulating qrs axes and
occurred repetitively. although a detailed mapping of the
initiating sequence of pvt episodes was beyond the scope
of our study, these characteristics suggest that pvt in this
model were initiated by eads and maintained in a
substrate of functional re-entry based on increased dispersion of apd [20]. comparable with our data, extreme
action potential prolongation in association with eads was
seen in microelectrode recordings from the isolated rv in
the same model at long cls [19]. here we show that
heterogeneous action potential prolongation increases dispersion of apd at long cls in the intact  xxxg2028xxx -tg heart,
thereby increasing dispersion of refractoriness and enabling functional re-entry.

4.4. effect of pacing
pacing at physiological rates effectively suppressed and
prevented pvt. this antiarrhythmic effect was associated
with shorter apd, a decreased dispersion of apd, and
with suppression of eads. pacing thereby both eliminated
the trigger for spontaneous arrhythmias, afterdepolarisations and triggered activity, and reduced the substrate for
functional re-entry by decreasing dispersion of repolarisation.
late ina in the dkpq  xxxg2028xxx  mutation shows ratedependent slow inactivation as shown by whole-cell patch
clamp recordings in transfected hek293 cells [27]. rate
dependent reduction of the late inward sodium current may
cause shortening of the action potential at short cls,
thereby also reducing apd dispersion (see above). similar
to our data in a transgenic intact heart model of  xxxg2028xxx , qt
shortening in response to cardiac pacing has been reported
in a drug-induced cellular model mimicking the  xxxg2028xxx 
defect [31] and in patients [8].  xxxg2028xxx  patients are expected
to derive special benefit from anti-bradycardic pacing [32].
in a family with the 1795insd mutation of the  xxxg2028xxx 
gene, pacemaker therapy has proven protective [28]. our
data demonstrate for the first time that pacing reduces

1091

dispersion of apd and prevents eads and pvt in this
transgenic model of  xxxg2028xxx .
 xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts showed marked intrinsic ventricular
bradycardia after av nodal block. during sleep, normal
individuals may experience short episodes of sinus
bradycardia or of 2:1 av nodal block with junctional
escape rhythms. these arrhythmias are usually asymptomatic. in  xxxg2028xxx  patients, in contrast, such short bradycardia episodes may be sufficient to provoke eads and pvt.
in addition to the deleterious effects of slow ventricular
rates, sudden rate accelerations caused a transient increase
in apd ([19], fig. 3) and apd dispersion (fig. 3). these
observations may suggest that rate-smoothing algorithms
could be beneficial in pacing therapy of  xxxg2028xxx  patients.

4.5. effect of sodium channel block by  xxxd2635xxx 
by shortening apd at long cls,  xxxd2635xxx  decreased
the chance of spontaneous eads occurring at long apds
and also reduced the transient apd prolongation after
sudden rate accelerations. similar effects of  xxxd2635xxx  on
apd and apd dispersion have been reported in pharmacological models of  xxxg2028xxx  [31,30]. shortening of the qt
interval by  xxxd2635xxx  has also been reported in patients
[8]. our study reproduces these findings in a transgenic
model of  xxxg2028xxx . with  xxxd2635xxx , refractory periods were
longer than apd, resulting in post repolarisation refractoriness, comparable to the effects of other sodium channel
blockers [25,26] and the combined use of  xxxd2635xxx  and
sotalol [33]. post repolarisation refractoriness has been
shown to have antiarrhythmic effects in experimental and
clinical studies [25,26]. by preventing excitability during
late repolarisation of the action potential, post repolarisation refractoriness may directly suppress spontaneous
ventricular activity related to afterdepolarisations, thereby
as well suppressing eads and triggered arrhythmias. in
contrast to pacing, however,  xxxd2635xxx  did not completely
prevent pvt in our study, possibly because  xxxd2635xxx 
aggravated bradycardia in  xxxg2028xxx -tg hearts.
in this intact heart study, we could not determine the
molecular effect of  xxxd2635xxx  on the cellular level and on
the gating properties of the mutated sodium channel.
lidocaine and  xxxd2635xxx  at low concentrations preferentially block late openings of the dkpq sodium channel
[34,35] without greatly modifying peak sodium current.
this implies that pharmacological shortening of the action
potential in patients might be possible without compromising conduction severely [36]. lidocaine has been shown to
augment closed-state-inactivation of the r1623q mutated
sodium channel [37].  xxxd2635xxx  could as well drive the
dkpq sodium channel from closed into the inactivated
state, thereby attenuating late reopenings and bursts [38].
furthermore,  xxxd2635xxx  rescued the expression defect in
another  xxxg2028xxx  mutation, m1766l, in embryonic kidney
cells [38].

5. implications
our data demonstrate that prevention of bradycardia by
pacing suppressed pvt in this  xxxg2028xxx  knock-in mouse
heart model of  xxxg2028xxx . patients with this mutation, and
potentially other patients with  xxxg2028xxx , may benefit from
pacing at physiological rates using a rate-smoothing algorithm.  xxxd2635xxx  caused both pro- and antiarrhythmic
effects in this model, and although the antiarrhythmic
effects prevailed, did not appear as safe as pacing for the
prevention of pvt.
there are important differences in heart rate, repolarising currents, and size between murine and human hearts,
and results from measurements in transgenic mice therefore need to be transferred to the clinical setting with
caution [39]. nonetheless, our findings in this transgenic
 xxxg2028xxx  model correspond well to the limited observations in
patients. the pathophysiological observations may provide
a rationale for preventive pacing to avoid pauses and
sudden rate accelerations during bradycardia in  xxxg2028xxx .
