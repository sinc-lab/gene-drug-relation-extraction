abstract
risperidone is a novel atypical neuroleptic with a favorable profile of side effects due to its unique pharmacological activity: it exhibits
both potent dopamine d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  blocking activity, as well as high affinity for a1 and a2 adrenergic receptors and histamine h1
receptor. we found that risperidone has a potent antinociceptive effect in the tailflick assay with an ed50 of 26.4 mg/kg. this effect of
risperidone was antagonized by naloxone (p , 0.05). this sensitivity to naloxone indicates that at least some of the analgesic effects of
risperidone are mediated by an opioid mechanism of action. b-fna (m1 m2-antagonist), naloxonazine (m1-antagonist) and norbinaltorphamine (nor-bni; k1-analgesia) reversed risperidone antinociceptive effect (p , 0.05). naltrindole (d-antagonist) only partially reversed
risperidone antinociceptive effect. we found that the sensitivity of risperidone antinociceptive effect to selective antagonists implies
involvement of m1-, m2- and k1-opioid and to a lesser extent d-opioid mechanisms. these results suggest a possible role for risperidone
both in the management of pain and in the management of opiate withdrawal and detoxification.  1997 elsevier science ireland ltd.

the opioid receptors were identified biochemically in the
mammalian brain only in the early 1970’s [14], however,
opiates were the drug of choice for severe pain for the last
thousand years. but side effects such as tolerance, physical
dependence, respiratory depression and constipation,
together with a combined tangle of political, moral, and
psychological issues, greatly limit their prolonged use as
treatment of chronic pain syndromes [11]. in the past
three decades heterocyclic antidepressants have assumed
an important role in the treatment of patients with a variety
of painful diseases, mostly as at the doses necessary for pain
control, their side effects and toxicity are rarely a problem
[8,10,20,21].
contrary to antidepressants, neuroleptics do not have a
well-established place in the management of pain. though
antinociceptive effects of neuroleptics in animal pain-models (due to a central muscle relaxant property) have been

described, their clinical use is limited, since it is frequently
complicated by parkinsonian side effects. these (non-dose
dependent) side effects are inevitable when treating psychosis, but frequently outweigh benefit when treating pain,
where other effective classes of drugs exist. nevertheless,
the clinical use of neuroleptics, especially in combination
with opiates or tricyclic antidepressants, is not uncommon,
though controversial [3,4,10,20,22].
risperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative, the first of a
new class of drugs developed for the treatment of schizophrenia, called ‘atypical neuroleptics’. risperidone has
potent dopamine d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  blocking activity
(as well as a high affinity for a1 and a2 adrenergic receptors
and histamine h1 receptors) [1]. this unique pharmacological profile (combined d2/5-ht2 antagonism) is the reason
for risperidone’s very mild profile of side effects, as documented in a series of clinical trials throughout the world. in
some studies comparing haloperidol, clozapine and risperidone in schizophrenic patients, risperidone was found at
least as effective as haloperidol and clozapine for reducing

psychotic symptoms, with fewer extrapyramidal side effects
and improved tolerability [5,7,9].
to date, however, no data have been published describing
the possible use of risperidone in a model of pain. in the
present study we examined the antinociceptive effects of
risperidone alone and in conjunction with opioids, using
the radiant heat tailflick technique assay in the mouse.
male icr mice from tel-aviv university colony (telaviv, israel), 25–35 g in weight were used. the mice were
maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with purina rodent
chow and water available ad libitum. animals were housed
five per cage in a room maintained at 22 ± 0.5°c and were
used only once. intrathecal injections in mice were made
under light halothane anesthesia, using a hamilton 10 ml
syringe fitted to a 30-gauge needle with v1 tubing. the
intrathecal (i.t.) injections were introduced by lumbar puncture [6].
risperidone hcl was a generous gift from abic (netanya, israel), morphine sulphate was a generous gift from
teva (jerusalem, israel). naloxonazine was a generous
gift from dr. g.w. pasternak from memorial sloan-kettering cancer center, new york, ny, usa. u50,488-h
{trans-3,4-dichloro-n-methyl-n-[2-(1-pyrrolindinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide} was a generous gift from upjohn
pharmaceutics (west sussex, uk). (d-pen2,d-pen5)enkephalin (dpdpe), b-funaltrexamine (b-fna), naltrindol
hcl, nalorphine hcl,  xxxd2694xxx , and norbinaltorphamine (nor-bni), were obtained from the research technology branch of nida.  xxxd1993xxx  ( xxxd1993xxx ) was purchased
from abbott (campoverde, italy). all other compounds
were purchased from commercial sources. risperidone
was dissolved in saline with the addition of several drops
of tween 80. all other drugs were dissolved in saline.
antinociception was determined, utilizing the radiant
heat tailflick technique [2], using the tailflick apparatus
(ugo basile). the latency to withdraw the tail from a
focused light stimulus was measured electronically, using
a photocell. baseline latencies (2.0–3.0 s) were determined
before experimental treatments for all animals as the means
of two trials. post-treatment latencies were determined as
indicated for each experiment and a maximal latency of 10 s
was used to minimize tissue damage. antinociception was
defined quantitatively as a doubling or more of baseline
values for each mouse. for each point (dose), at least 10
different mice were checked and their scores were summarized, showing the percentage of animals that became
analgesic. each mouse had been checked once. post-treatment latencies were determined for opioids which were
subcutaneously (s.c.) administrated 30 min, for risperidone
administrated intraperitoneal (i.p.) 60 min after the injection. post-treatment latencies for i.t. administration was
determined after 15 min.
dose-response curves were analyzed, using an spss
computer program. this program maximizes the log-likelihood function to fit a parallel set of gaussian normal sigmoid curves to the dose-response data. single dose

antagonist studies were analyzed using the fisher’s exact
test.
risperidone induced a potent and dose-dependent antinociceptive effect following i.p. administration (fig. 1). the
ed50 for mice in the tailflick assay for risperidone was 26.4
mg/kg (17.5; 40.8; 95% cl).
the antinociceptive effect of risperidone was antagonized by naloxone from 85% to 20% (1 mg/kg s.c.;
p , 0.05), raising the possibility of an opioid functional
role involved in risperidone-induced antinociceptive effect
(fig. 2).
in the next stage, the involvement of the selective antagonists for m1, m2, d and k1 opioid receptors subtype was
assessed to evaluate their potential involvement in risperidone antinociceptive effect. we examined the ability of
these antagonists to block risperidone antinociception
(fig. 2). administered 24 h prior to testing, b-fna (40
mg/kg, s.c.) was found to be a selective m1 and m2 antagonist
[12], while naloxonazine (35 mg/kg, s.c.) was shown to be a
selective m1 antagonist [12]. similarly, the d selective
antagonist naltrindole (20 mg/kg, s.c.) blocks antinociception [13] and nor-bni (10 mg/kg, s.c.) is a selective k1
antagonist [19]. all the antagonists did not mediate antinociception by themselves and do not change the latencies of
the baselines of the pretreated animals.
b-fna and naloxonazine reversed risperidone antinociceptive effect at the same dose needed to reverse morphine
antinociception, suggesting a role for the m1 and m2 receptors
in risperidone antinociceptive effect (p , 0.05; fig. 2).
the dose of naltrindole that reversed dpdpe antinociception reversed only partially risperidone antinociceptive
effect. risperidone antinociceptive was blocked by nor-

received an i.p. injection of risperidone at the indicated dose and were
tested in the hotplate test 60 min later.

fig. 2. effects of opioid antagonists on risperidone (ris) antinociceptive
effect. groups of mice (n ≥ 10) were treated with risperidone (40 mg/kg;
i.p.) alone or were challenged in addition with naloxone (1.0 mg/kg; s.c.),
b-fna (40 mg/kg; s.c.), naloxonazine (35 mg/kg, s.c.) naltrindole (20 mg/
kg; s.c.) or nor-bni (10 mg/kg; s.c.).

bni at the same dose nor-bni reversed k1 antinociception,
mediated by u50,488h (p , 0.05; fig. 2a). the activity of
each of the antagonists was confirmed with its prototypic
agonists (data not shown).
the sensitivity of risperidone antinociceptive effect to
selective antagonists implies m and k1 mechanisms of action
and to a lesser extent d mechanisms.
in the next stage, multiple doses of the selective agonist
of the m subtype morphine were co-administrated with vehicle or with an inactive (subthreshold) dose of risperidone (5
mg/kg, i.p., table 1). a 2-fold shift to the left in the doseresponse curve was observed, although the differences did
not reach a statistical significance. the ed50 of morphine
without risperidone was 5.2 mg/kg and with risperidone was
2.2 mg/kg. various doses of the selective agonist of the d
subtype dpdpe with or without an inactive dose of risperidone (5 mg/kg, i.p., table 1) were injected. a 4-fold shift to
the left in the dose-response curve was detected (p , 0.05).
ed50 of dpdpe without risperidone was 311 ng, i.t. and
with risperidone was 73 ng, i.t. the selective agonist of
the k1 subtype u50,488h was injected with or without an
inactive dose of risperidone (5 mg/kg, i.p., table 1). a 15fold shift to the left in the dose-response curve (p , 0.05)
was obtained. ed50 of u50,488h without risperidone was
4.4 mg/kg, s.c. and with risperidone was 0.3 mg/kg, s.c. the
selective agonist of the k3 subtype nalorphine was administered with or without an inactive dose of risperidone (5 mg/
kg, i.p., table 1). we found an almost 10-fold shift to the
left in the dose-response curve (p , 0.05). ed50 of nalorphine without risperidone was 28.2 mg/kg, s.c. and with
risperidone was 3.0 mg/kg, s.c.
in the present study, risperidone was found to have a
potent antinociceptive effect in the mouse radiant tailflick
assay, in a dose dependent manner when administered i.p.
the antinociceptive effect of risperidone was antagonized

by the non-specific opioid naloxone and by the selective
opioid receptor antagonists, implying that there may be an
opioid mechanism of action involved in risperidone induced
antinociceptive effect. selective, m-opioid receptor antagonists reversed risperidone antinociceptive effect at the same
dose they reversed morphine antinociception, suggesting a
role for both m1- and m2-opioid receptor in risperidone antinociceptive effect. selective k1-opioid receptor antagonist
reversed risperidone antinociceptive effect at the same
dose it reversed k1-opioid antinociception, mediated by
u50,488h. however, d-opioid receptor antagonist reversed
only partially the risperidone antinociceptive effect. when
an inactive dose of risperidone was administered together
with specific opioid receptor subtype agonists, significant
potentiation of the analgesic effect was noted following
u50,488h (k1), nalorphine (k3) and dpdpe (d). the coadministration of risperidone potentiates morphine (m)
induced antinociception, but without reaching statistical significance. the sensitivity of risperidone antinociceptive
effect is mainly to selective opioid receptors subtypes k1
and k3. in addition, risperidone antinociceptive effect was
sensitive to m1- and m2-antagonists and to a lesser extent to dopioid mechanisms. the addition of risperidone at inactive
doses significantly potentiates d subtype and to a lesser
extant, m subtype.
in previous studies we evaluated the antinociceptive
effect of nefazodone (an antidepressant with complex but
non-selective antagonism of post-synaptic 5-ht receptors),
and of two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)
(pre-synaptic agonists) antidepressants fluoxetine and fluvoxamine [15–17]. all three drugs (nefazodone, fluoxetine
and fluvoxamine). were found to enhance opioid analgesia
when co-administered with various opioid receptor agonists.
when administered alone, each of them induced an antinociceptive effect which was not antagonized by naloxone,
hence indicating that this antinociceptive effect is mediated
by a non-opioid mechanism of action [15–17].  xxxd2637xxx , a

and 5-ht1 and 5-ht3 receptors (weak) and both moderate
pre-synaptic a2 antagonist and antihistamine (h1) effects)
was found too, to enhance opioid analgesia when co-administered with various opioid receptor agonists. however,
administered alone,  xxxd2637xxx  induced an antinociceptive
effect which was antagonized by naloxone, suggesting a
possible involvement of the opioid system in its mechanism
of action [18].
our findings of a possible interaction of risperidone
induced antinociception and the opioid system may be due
either to risperidone’s strong blockade of post-synaptic 5ht2 receptors (like  xxxd2637xxx ’s), or to the combined postsynaptic action of this drug on both dopamine d2 and 5-ht2
receptors. the involvement of the adrenergic system, and
the histaminergic system may also play some role in risperidone’s possible interaction of antinociceptive effects with
the opioid mechanism system, however, the review of this
possible interaction of the opioid system with these two
neurotransmitters is beyond the scope of this paper. risperidone’s unique pharmacological profile almost without
extrapyramidal side effects, together with its antinociceptive properties, may imply a possible role for this agent both
in the management of pain and in the management of opiate
withdrawal and detoxification, a speculation which should
be addressed in further research. further clinical research is
required to determine the efficacy of risperidone in pain
management in humans, and the role of d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  in risperidone’s antinociceptive effect merits further
basic studies with selective agonists and antagonists at
these receptors sites.
