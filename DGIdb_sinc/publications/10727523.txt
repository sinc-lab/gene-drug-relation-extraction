the human multidrug resistance proteins 1 and 2 [ xxxg13xxx 
and  xxxg15xxx  (multispecific organic anion transporter), respectively] are homologous members of a subfamily of the atpbinding cassette transporters, and both may cause multiple
drug resistance in malignant tumor cells (cole et al., 1992;
zaman et al., 1994; cui et al., 1999). by now, at least six
members of this subfamily have been identified, and they
seem to play an important role in various secretory and other
transport functions, predominantly in epithelial cells (borst
et al., 1997; kool et al., 1997; cui et al., 1999). both  xxxg13xxx 
and  xxxg15xxx  were shown to perform an atp-dependent, primary active transport of the glutathione (gs) conjugate leukotriene c4 (ltc4) and of various gs, sulfate, and glucuronide conjugates (jedlitschky et al., 1994, 1996, 1997; müller

atpase activity in isolated membranes containing  xxxg13xxx  or
 xxxg15xxx  was significantly stimulated by nem-gs and reduced
gs, although these compounds acted only at higher concentrations in  xxxg15xxx . atp hydrolysis by  xxxg15xxx  was also effectively
stimulated by methotrexate. probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , indomethacin, furosemide, and  xxxd2871xxx  all significantly increased  xxxg15xxx -atpase activity, whereas these compounds
acted more as atpase inhibitors on  xxxg13xxx . these results indicate that  xxxg13xxx  is a more efficient transporter of glutathione
conjugates and free glutathione than  xxxg15xxx , whereas several
anions are preferred substrates for  xxxg15xxx . our data suggest
that  xxxg15xxx  may be responsible for the active secretion of pharmacologically relevant organic anions, such as diuretics and
antibiotics, and indicate different modulation possibilities for
 xxxg13xxx  or  xxxg15xxx  in drug-resistant tumor cells.

et al., 1994). it is most likely that  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  can also
transport hydrophobic drugs (cole et al., 1994; holló et al.,
1996; evers et al., 1998), although cellular gs seems to be an
important modulator in these transport functions (see zaman et al., 1995; loe et al., 1996, 1998).
the physiological role of these highly promiscuous transporters may cover a wide range, varying from the transport of
excretory compounds and the elimination of xenobiotics, to
the mediation of an inflammatory response. the widely expressed  xxxg13xxx  has a key function in, for example, ltc4dependent tissue reactions, as well as in controlling transport across the blood-brain barrier (wijnholds et al., 1997;
rao et al., 1999), and in polarized cells, this protein is sorted
to the basolateral membranes (see borst et al., 1997; deeley
and cole, 1997).  xxxg15xxx  is predominantly expressed in the
canalicular (apical) membranes of hepatocytes and the epithelial cells of kidney proximal tubules (schaub et al., 1997;
evers et al., 1998). this protein was shown to be the most
important exporter of conjugated bile salts in the liver

abstract
the human  xxxg12xxx   xxxg13xxx  and its homolog,  xxxg15xxx , are both suggested as being involved in cancer
drug resistance and the transport of organic anions. we expressed  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in spodoptera frugiperda ovarian
cells and compared their atp-dependent transport properties
and vanadate-sensitive atpase activities in isolated membrane
vesicles. both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  actively transported leukotriene c4 and  xxxd2684xxx  glutathione (nem-gs), although
the relative affinity of  xxxg15xxx  for these substrates was found to
be significantly lower than that of  xxxg13xxx . methotrexate was
actively transported by both proteins, although more efficiently
by  xxxg15xxx . atp-dependent nem-gs transport by  xxxg13xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx  was variably modulated by organic anions. probenecid
and furosemide inhibited, whereas under certain conditions
 xxxd3256xxx ,  xxxd2871xxx , and indomethacin greatly stimulated,  xxxg15xxx -mediated nem-gs uptake. vanadate-sensitive

materials. [ h]ltc4 (135 ci/mmol) and [3h]methotrexate (15
ci/mmol) were obtained from dupont-new england nuclear (boston, ma) and moravek biochemicals (brea, ca), respectively.

[3h]nem-gs was prepared from [3h]nem (60 ci/mmol; dupontnew england nuclear) by mixing the isotope in 10 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.0) with freshly dissolved reduced gs (gsh) in a 1:1.1 molar ratio.
expression of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in insect cells. recombinant
baculoviruses containing the  xxxg13xxx  cdna were prepared as described by bakos et al. (1998) by using the baculogold transfection
kit (pharmingen, san diego, ca).  xxxg15xxx  baculoviruses were prepared similarly:  xxxg15xxx  cdna (paulusma et al., 1996) from modified
pgem- xxxg15xxx  (to remove an out-of-frame upstream start codon, the
sequence of the 5⬘ utr was changed to ctttaaaaatacaaa using
polymerase chain reaction) was removed by digestion with hindiii
and ncoi and subcloned into the pacuw21 plasmid (invitrogen, san
diego, ca). sf9 cells were cultured and infected with a baculovirus as
described in müller et al. (1996).
membrane preparation and immunoblotting. virus-infected
sf9 cells were harvested, their membranes were isolated and stored,
and the membrane protein concentrations were determined as described in sarkadi et al. (1992). immunoblotting was performed after
dissolving and sonicating the isolated membranes in a disaggregation buffer.  xxxg13xxx  was detected with the monoclonal antibody  xxxg13xxx 
m6 (flens et al., 1996), and  xxxg15xxx  was detected with the monoclonal
antibody m2-iii-6. protein-antibody interaction was determined using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique as described previously (bakos et al., 1998). for the detection of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in
mammalian cells, we used s1- xxxg13xxx -transfected and mdckiimrp2-transfected cells (zaman et al., 1994; evers et al., 1998).
transport measurements. [3h]nem-gs, [3h]ltc4, and [3h]methotrexate transport measurements in isolated sf9 cell membrane
vesicles were performed as described earlier by bakos et al. (1998).
in brief, vesicles were incubated in the presence of 4 mm atp or
amp in a buffer containing 10 mm mgcl2, 40 mm 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-tris (ph 7.0), and 50 mm kcl at 23°c (ltc4)
or at 37°c (nem-gs, methotrexate). aliquots of this suspension
were added to excess cold transport buffer and then rapidly filtered
through 0.25-␮m-pore nitrocellulose membranes. the filters were
washed extensively, and radioactivity associated with the filters was
measured by liquid scintillation counting. atp-dependent transport
was calculated by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of
amp from those in the presence of atp. the figures represent mean
values from three independent experiments.
membrane atpase measurements. atpase activity was measured basically as described by sarkadi et al. (1992) by determining
the liberation of inorganic phosphate from atp with a colorimetric
reaction. the incubation media contained 10 mm mgcl2, 40 mm
3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-tris (ph 7.0), 50 mm kcl, 5
mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm egta, 4 mm na-azide, 1 mm ouabain,
and 4 mm atp. the final membrane protein concentration was 200
␮g/ml. the incubation time was 60 min at 37°c. special care was
taken to avoid any possible changes in the ph of the assay medium
at higher organic anion concentrations. the figures represent mean
values from three independent experiments.

expression of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in insect cells. figure
1 demonstrates that both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  were successfully
expressed in sf9 cells. according to our estimation from several similar immunoblotting studies, the isolated sf9 cell
membranes contained about 20 times higher levels of these
proteins than the corresponding, highly drug-resistant s1mrp1 or mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cell membranes. in sf9 cells, both
proteins were produced in an underglycosylated form, which
has been demonstrated to not affect their transport functions
(gao et al., 1996; bakos et al., 1998; van aubel et al., 1998).
the exact comparison of the expression levels of the proteins
in sf9 cells could not be performed because we had no monoclonal antibody recognizing equivalent epitopes in  xxxg13xxx  and

(büchler et al., 1996; paulusma et al., 1996; jedlitschky et
al., 1997).  xxxg13xxx  definitely, and  xxxg15xxx  probably, plays an
important role in the chemotherapy resistance of several
types of cancer cells (see deeley and cole, 1997; kool et al.,
1997). therefore, the determination of the substrate interactions with these two transporters is of major importance for
the understanding of the cellular pharmacology and toxicology of a wide variety of compounds, as well as for the proper
planning and adjustment of cancer chemotherapy.
in the present study, we expressed  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in
baculovirus-infected spodoptera frugiperda ovarian (sf9) insect cells and measured the atp-dependent, vanadate-sensitive transport of two established mrp substrates, ltc4
and  xxxd2684xxx  (nem)-gs, as well as of the organic
anion anticancer agent methotrexate, in isolated membrane
vesicles. in the insect cell membrane preparations, we also
examined the effect of various anionic compounds on the
specific, vanadate-inhibitable atpase activity of  xxxg13xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx . both human  xxxg13xxx  (bakos et al., 1996, 1998; gao et
al., 1996) and  xxxg15xxx  from rabbit (van aubel et al., 1998) have
been successfully expressed in baculovirus-infected insect
cells, and although underglycosylated, their basic structural
and transport characteristics were found to be identical to
those seen in mammalian cells. because high-level heterologous protein expression makes the involvement of any complementary or closely related endogenous transporter unlikely, direct transport measurements in isolated insect cell
membrane vesicles can be most helpful in establishing the
relative affinities and transport rates for various substrates
of these human transporters. drug-stimulated atpase in
insect cell membranes was first applied to characterize the
enzymatic function of human  xxxg12xxx 
(p-glycoprotein) ( xxxg10xxx ; sarkadi et al., 1992), and since then,
it has proved to be a valuable tool for the simple and efficient
screening of substrate-transporter interactions in numerous
studies (see scarborough, 1995; germann, 1998).
our experiments were prompted by the data obtained with
 xxxg13xxx - and  xxxg15xxx -expressing polarized mammalian cells
(r.e., m. de haas, r. sparidans, j. beijnen, p. r. wielinga, j.
lankelma, and p.b., unpublished data), which indicated major differences between the transport properties of  xxxg13xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx . in accordance with those data, the results in the
present report suggest that several non-gs-conjugate anionic
pharmacons are efficiently transported by  xxxg15xxx , whereas
these compounds act mostly as inhibitors on  xxxg13xxx . several
organic anions (e.g., probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , indomethacin, furosemide, and  xxxd2871xxx ) are actively secreted over
the apical membrane of the proximal tubules of the kidney.
because  xxxg15xxx  is predominantly expressed in this region of
the kidney (schaub et al., 1997), our experiments suggest
that  xxxg15xxx  may be a key player in this secretion. this information may facilitate the proper planning of pharmacological
interventions in diseases related to the altered metabolism,
distribution, and transport of organic anions, as well as the
elimination of transporter-specific multidrug resistance in
cancer cells.

described in experimental procedures. the samples were obtained from
s1  xxxg13xxx  cells (lane 1, 10 ␮g protein), mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells (lane 5, 10 ␮g
protein), and isolated membranes of sf9 cells expressing either  xxxg13xxx 
(lanes 2 and 6, 1 ␮g protein),  xxxg15xxx  (lanes 3 and 7, 1 ␮g protein), or
␤-galactosidase (lanes 4 and 8, 2 ␮g protein).

dependent transport in all experiments. for the characterization of the function of  xxxg13xxx  or  xxxg15xxx  (i.e., for calculating
the transport rates), in each case the linear phase of the
tracer uptake (20 s for ltc4 and 4 min for methotrexate and
nem-gs; see bakos et al., 1998) was used. atp-dependent
tracer uptake was calculated by subtracting the values measured in the presence of amp.
we found that both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  efficiently transported ltc4 and nem-gs, but the concentrations of these
compounds at which half-maximum uptake rates were
reached (k1/2) were significantly higher for  xxxg15xxx  than for
 xxxg13xxx . the k1/2 for ltc4 uptake of  xxxg13xxx  was 130 to 150 nm
(see also bakos et al., 1998), whereas that of  xxxg15xxx  was 1 to
1.4 ␮m (not shown). the transport data for nem-gs and
methotrexate are shown in detail in fig. 2, a and b. the k1/2
value for atp-dependent nem-gs uptake in  xxxg13xxx -containing vesicles was about 200 ␮m, whereas this value was about
2.5 mm in  xxxg15xxx -containing membranes. in contrast to ltc4
and nem-gs, methotrexate was significantly more efficiently transported by  xxxg15xxx , with an approximate k1/2 of 2.5
to 3 mm. for  xxxg13xxx , because of the low transport rates, the
k1/2 value could not be exactly determined. still, even at high
methotrexate concentrations, the transport rate by  xxxg13xxx  did
not approach the level of nem-gs uptake by the same transporter. when examining the effects of free gsh on methotrexate uptake, we found no stimulation of this transport for
either  xxxg13xxx  or  xxxg15xxx , whereas gsh at more than 10 mm
caused a slight inhibition of vesicular methotrexate uptake
(not shown).
because the active secretion of organic anions in the kidney proximal tubules may involve  xxxg15xxx  (see discussion), we
also studied the effects of some other known secreted organic
anions and secretion inhibitors on the nem-gs transport by
 xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . furosemide and  xxxd2871xxx  are known
substrates of this secretory pathway, which is competitively
inhibited by probenecid and  xxxd3256xxx  and probably
noncompetitively by benzbromarone.

relative rate of nem-gs uptake by  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . in the

 xxxg15xxx . based on gel staining, chimera protein expression
studies,2 and the following transport and atpase data, the
sf9 cell membrane expression levels were estimated to be
roughly similar for  xxxg13xxx ,  xxxg15xxx , and those measured formerly for  xxxg10xxx .
transport measurements in membrane vesicles. to
compare the transport characteristics of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx ,
we studied the uptake of the radiolabeled gs conjugates
ltc4 and nem-gs, as well as the anticancer drug methotrexate, in isolated sf9 cell membrane vesicles. as demonstrated previously, the relative amount of sf9 membrane
vesicles and their transport competence were not affected by
the expression of various foreign membrane proteins (bakos
et al., 1998). examination of the transport of each labeled
compound in control, ␤-galactosidase-expressing sf9 cell
membranes showed that the atp-dependent tracer uptake
was negligible. also, the addition of 1 m sucrose to the assay
media, causing shrinkage of the vesicles, eliminated atp-

substrate interactions with  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx 

experiments presented in fig. 3, tracer uptake was measured
at relatively low nem-gs concentrations (4 ␮m). in the case
of  xxxg13xxx  (fig. 3a), we found that  xxxd3256xxx  and probenecid efficiently inhibited atp-dependent active vesicular
nem-gs uptake. however, low concentrations of indomethacin produced a significant stimulation of this gs-conjugate
uptake, and only indomethacin concentrations of more than
100 ␮m were inhibitory. in the case of  xxxg15xxx  (fig. 3, b and
c), probenecid inhibited nem-gs uptake, whereas low concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin strongly
stimulated the transport of this gs conjugate. higher  xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin concentrations were inhibitory
again. the addition of methotrexate caused a slight inhibition of the nem-gs uptake in both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . as
shown in fig. 3c for  xxxg15xxx , several other organic anions also
modulated nem-gs uptake:  xxxd2871xxx  caused a major
stimulation of this transport, whereas benzbromarone or furosemide was inhibitory. in the case of  xxxg13xxx , only the inhibition of nem-gs transport was observed with these compounds (not shown). in similar tracer transport experiments,
we also examined the effect of free gsh (2–10 mm) on the
rate of nem-gs uptake and found no significant stimulation
for either  xxxg13xxx  or  xxxg15xxx , whereas gsh concentrations of
more than 5 mm were slightly inhibitory (data not shown).
atpase measurements. the vanadate-sensitive atpase
activity of the multidrug transporter  xxxg10xxx  has been shown
to reflect the substrate interactions of this protein: transported substrates significantly (up to 3- to 6-fold compared
with the baseline level) stimulated the atpase activity,
whereas non  xxxg10xxx  substrates had no effect (see sarkadi et
al., 1992; scarborough, 1995). in one study, chang et al.
(1998) examined the vanadate-sensitive atpase of the purified  xxxg13xxx  protein and found stimulation by gs conjugates,
although stimulation was weak (1.3- to 1.5-fold). in the
present experiments, by using the high-level expression of
human  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in sf9 cells, we examined the effects of various compounds on the atpase activity of both
proteins in a membrane environment.
as documented in fig. 4, the vanadate-sensitive atpase
activity of both  xxxg13xxx  (fig. 4a) and  xxxg15xxx  (fig. 4b) was
relatively low in the absence of drugs (4–5 nmol/mg membrane protein/min) but significantly stimulated (reaching
about 13–15 nmol/mg membrane protein/min) by nem-gs.
membranes from cells expressing ␤-galactosidase had a lowlevel basal atpase activity (2–3 nmol/mg membrane protein/
min), and no measurable stimulation was detected by nemgs, gsh, or any of the other agents examined. compared
with the atpase activity of  xxxg10xxx  measured in similarly
prepared sf9 cell membranes (see müller et al., 1996) and
assuming similar expression levels for these human proteins,
the maximum level of the atpase activity in the case of both
 xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  was about 5 times smaller than that found
for  xxxg10xxx . in unpublished experiments, we compared the
levels of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg10xxx  expression in sf9 cell membranes
by using chimera  xxxg10xxx - xxxg13xxx  proteins and a set of mrp1and  xxxg10xxx -specific antibodies. these studies indicated comparable levels of  xxxg13xxx / xxxg10xxx  expression, corresponding to
about 3% of the total membrane protein. nevertheless, for
both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx , atp hydrolysis was linear for at least
60 min. therefore, we used this time period to analyze the
atpase activity. to ensure fully reductive assay conditions,
all assays were performed in the presence of 5 mm dithio-

activities was measured at saturating (4 mm) mgatp concentrations in all related experiments.
in the following set of experiments, we investigated the
effects of the organic anions probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , and
indomethacin on the atpase activity measured in isolated
sf9 cell membranes containing either  xxxg13xxx  (fig. 5a) or
 xxxg15xxx  (fig. 5b). because cellular gsh may significantly
affect transport by both mrps, we also examined the changes
in atpase activity in the presence of gsh (fig. 6). in the case
of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx , we used 5 and 10 mm gsh, respectively, to obtain only a partial stimulation of the atpase
activity of both transporters.
as documented in fig. 5a, in  xxxg13xxx -containing membranes the organic anions tested produced only a weak
atpase activation in comparison to nem-gs. a significant
inhibition of the  xxxg13xxx -atpase was observed at higher organic anion concentrations. in contrast, the atpase activity
of  xxxg15xxx  (fig. 5b) was strongly stimulated by both probenecid (approximate kact ⫽ 250 ␮m),  xxxd3256xxx  (kact ⫽
300 ␮m), and indomethacin (kact ⫽ 150 ␮m), and atpase
activation was even stronger than in the case of nem-gs.
the organic anion activation of the  xxxg15xxx -atpase followed
bell-shaped curves, with maximum values obtained at about
2 mm for probenecid, 800 ␮m for  xxxd3256xxx , and 400 ␮m
for indomethacin.
as shown in fig. 6a, in  xxxg13xxx -containing membranes 5
mm gsh gave a substantial atpase activity, which was
significantly inhibited by probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , and
higher concentrations of indomethacin. indomethacin at low
concentrations (5–100 ␮m) induced a stimulation of the
 xxxg13xxx -atpase activity. in  xxxg15xxx -containing membranes
(fig. 6b), the stimulation brought about by 10 mm gsh
alone was less pronounced than that in the case of  xxxg13xxx ,
and the presence of gsh did not change the overall stimulatory effects of probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , or indomethacin.
in general, an additive effect was observed on the atpase
activity by these organic anions and gsh.
in experiments not documented in detail, we also tested
the effect of probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , and indomethacin on

concentrations of nem-gs (f), gsh (œ), or methotrexate (mtx, e), as indicated on the abscissa. for details of the atpase assay, see experimental

threitol, which had no effect on the atpase activity. these
atpase assay conditions did not allow the determination of
the concentration dependence of the chemically labile ltc4
molecule, but a significant stimulation of atpase activities
by both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  was measured at 5 ␮m ltc4 (data
not shown).
as shown in fig. 4, the maximum level of stimulation of the
atpase activity by nem-gs was similar for  xxxg13xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx , but the nem-gs concentration dependence was
clearly different: the estimated concentration producing halfmaximum activation (kact) for  xxxg13xxx  was about 400 to 500
␮m, whereas this value for  xxxg15xxx  approached 3 to 4 mm (we
could not exactly measure the maximum atpase rate because higher nem-gs concentrations inhibited the inorganic
phosphate assay). these atpase activation results closely
corresponded to the respective k1/2 values found for  xxxg13xxx 
and  xxxg15xxx  in the direct nem-gs transport measurements.
activation of the atpase by gsh was also different for the
two transporters: at 20 mm gsh, the atpase activity of
 xxxg13xxx  approached the level obtained with 5 mm nem-gs,
whereas in the case of  xxxg15xxx , even 20 mm gsh produced
only about 30% of the nem-gs activated atpase activity
(again, higher gsh concentrations disturbed the phosphate
assay). figure 4 also shows the effect of methotrexate on the
atpase activity of  xxxg13xxx  (fig. 4a)- and  xxxg15xxx  (fig. 4b)containing membranes. in the case of  xxxg13xxx , at methotrexate
concentrations between 0.5 and 2 mm, only a slight stimulation of the atpase activity was observed. in contrast, methotrexate concentrations of more than 200 ␮m significantly
stimulated the atpase activity of  xxxg15xxx .
to exclude that possible differences in atp dependence
could give rise to differences in the drug-stimulated atpase
activities, we examined the mgatp concentration dependence of the atpase activity of both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in the

similar (data not shown). drug modulation of the atpase

discussion
the membrane transporter proteins of the mrp family
seem to play a significant role in the cellular organic anion
extrusion, especially in secretory epithelial cells. although
these transporters show a high level of structural similarity
(see tusnády et al., 1997), their physiological and pharmacological functions may be different. in polarized epithelia,
 xxxg13xxx  is targeted to the basolateral membranes, whereas
 xxxg15xxx  is targeted to the apical membranes, and their substrate interactions seem to be overlapping but nonidentical
(borst et al., 1997; cui et al., 1999).
to study membrane protein-substrate interactions, the
high-level heterologous protein expression in insect cells has
numerous advantages. the sf9-baculovirus expression sys-

the membrane atpase activities in the presence of nem-gs
concentrations (1 and 3 mm, respectively) that partially activate the atpase of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . although the organic
acids under these conditions inhibited the  xxxg13xxx -atpase,
they significantly stimulated the  xxxg15xxx -atpase activity,
clearly overriding the nem-gs-stimulated atpase level.
as shown earlier (fig. 3c), several organic anions significantly modified nem-gs transport by  xxxg15xxx . figure 7 demonstrates that atp hydrolysis by  xxxg15xxx  (and not by  xxxg13xxx ;
data not shown) was strongly stimulated by furosemide
(kact ⬃ 300 ␮m, peak stimulation observed at 1 mm) and
 xxxd2871xxx  (kact ⬃ 1.5 mm, stimulation increasing up to 5
mm), whereas benzbromarone caused a strong inhibition of
the  xxxg15xxx -atpase at concentrations above 20 ␮m. paraaminohippuric acid (up to 3 mm) and  xxxd3472xxx  (up to 5 mm)
had no measurable effect on the atpase activity of either
 xxxg13xxx  or  xxxg15xxx . the presence of gsh caused an additive

fig. 7. vanadate-sensitive atpase activity of isolated sf9 cell membranes expressing  xxxg15xxx . effects of furosemide (〫),  xxxd2871xxx  (œ),
benzbromarone (‚),  xxxd3472xxx  (e), and para-aminohippuric acid (pah, )
are shown. membrane atpase activity was measured for 60 min at 37°c
in the presence of 4 mm atp (control, v), as described in experimental
procedures. the atpase activity obtained in the presence of 5 mm
nem-gs (f) is also marked.

 xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin significantly stimulated
 xxxg15xxx -dependent nem-gs uptake, whereas in the case of
 xxxg13xxx ,  xxxd3256xxx  inhibited and only indomethacin produced such a stimulation. these tracer uptake experiments
clearly suggested that various organic anions acted differently on the two transporters and warranted further detailed
studies for these interactions.
an efficient and relatively simple way to study substrate
interactions with the multidrug transporters is to measure
their vanadate-sensitive atpase activity, either in the original membrane environment (see sarkadi et al., 1992; scarborough, 1995) or in isolated and reconstituted systems (ambudkar et al., 1992). this atpase activity has been
convincingly documented to reflect the turnover rate of these
transporters, in which substrate transport is strongly coupled to substrate-stimulated atpase activity (see germann,
1998). a low-level, gs conjugate- and flavonoid-stimulated
atpase activity in  xxxg13xxx -containing mammalian cell membranes has already been noted (hooijberg et al., 1997), and
the isolated and reconstituted  xxxg13xxx  protein has also been
reported to be activated (to about 30 –50%) by ltc4 and adp
(chang et al., 1998). while this manuscript was under revision, hagmann et al. (1999) reported a substrate-stimulated
atpase activity of the purified and reconstituted  xxxg15xxx  protein.
as documented in figs. 4 to 7, vanadate-sensitive atpase
activity measurements in sf9 cell membranes could be efficiently applied to the characterization of the substrate interactions with  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . in the isolated sf9 cell membranes, expressing high levels of these exogenous proteins,
the transport of nem-gs or methotrexate was found to
closely correlate with the atpase activity stimulated by
these substrates. moreover, in the case of several substrates,
the estimated level of drug stimulation resulted in a 6- to
10-fold increase in the atpase activity. based on these results, the mrp-atpase activity assay can be used to study a
large variety of substrate interactions, even if radiolabeled
compounds are unavailable or unsuitable for vesicular transport studies.
the most significant differences between  xxxg13xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx , as observed in both the transport and atpase experiments, were their interactions with several organic anions,
which have already been indicated to inhibit the function of
 xxxg13xxx ; these included probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , benzbromarone, and indomethacin (jedlitschky et al., 1994; versantwoort et al., 1995; holló et al., 1996), and their effects on
 xxxg15xxx  have also been noted (evers et al., 1998).
in human pharmacology, a large number of amphiphilic
organic anions are known to bind to albumin in the blood
plasma, and although little filtration occurs in the glomeruli,
they are actively secreted into both the bile and the lumen of
the kidney proximal tubules (see paulusma et al., 1996;
roch-ramel, 1998). here, we studied the effects of such organic anions, including methotrexate, a major anticancer and
immunosuppressive drug; the uricosuric compounds probenecid and  xxxd3256xxx , which in turn modulate the secretion of many other organic anion antibiotics (e.g., penicillins,
cephalosporins, or sulfonamides); indomethacin, an example
of a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agent; furosemide, a
widely used diuretic; and the antibiotic  xxxd2871xxx .
as documented in results, these organic anions predominantly inhibited gs conjugate transport and the atpase

tem provides correct protein folding and insertion into a
membrane environment, and the insect cell membranes lack
closely related modulator or transporter proteins. the applicability of this system for the study of various multidrug
transporters has been demonstrated in several studies
(sarkadi et al., 1992; bakos et al., 1996, 1998; gao et al.,
1996; germann, 1998; van aubel et al., 1998). in this study,
we used the baculovirus-sf9 system for the expression of
 xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  and obtained comparable high-level functional expression for both proteins. because we could not
determine the exact level of  xxxg13xxx / xxxg15xxx  expression, the
absolute values of the transport or atpase measurements
should be compared with care.
the direct vesicular tracer uptake experiments, as detailed
in results and presented in fig. 2, strongly suggest that both
 xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  can efficiently transport the gs conjugates
ltc4 and nem-gs, although the affinity of  xxxg13xxx  for these
compounds is about one order of magnitude greater than that
of  xxxg15xxx . these results provide a direct comparison of the
two proteins in the same membrane environment and reinforce former results obtained for the transport of ltc4 and
other gs and glucuronide conjugates in mammalian expression systems (see jedlitschky et al., 1994, 1996, 1997; zaman
et al., 1995; cui et al., 1999). when measuring labeled methotrexate uptake, we found that  xxxg15xxx  had a significantly
higher transport capacity for this organic anion than  xxxg13xxx 
(in the case of  xxxg13xxx , due to the low rate of tracer uptake, we
could not properly determine the k1/2 values). according to
most recent data (hooijberg et al., 1999), an atp-dependent
methotrexate uptake was also observed in membrane vesicles prepared from both  xxxg13xxx - and  xxxg15xxx -transfected human cells.
in transport experiments with labeled nem-gs, we did
not find any major effect of gsh for either  xxxg13xxx  or  xxxg15xxx .
when examining the effects of various monovalent organic
anions on the atp-dependent nem-gs uptake (fig. 3), we
found that probenecid effectively inhibited nem-gs uptake
by both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx . however, low concentrations of

substrate interactions with  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx 

properties of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  should also be considered
when devising or applying various inhibitors of tumor cell
drug resistance, evoked by the overexpression of one or the
other of these proteins.

activity of  xxxg13xxx  (although a stimulation of  xxxg13xxx -dependent
transport and atpase was observed by indomethacin). in
contrast, the atpase activity of  xxxg15xxx  was efficiently activated by all of the above compounds, and  xxxd3256xxx ,
indomethacin, and  xxxd2871xxx  also effectively stimulated
 xxxg15xxx -dependent nem-gs transport. the effects of gsh or
nem-gs were mostly additive in the atpase experiments.
extending previous studies, our experiments strongly suggest that  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  have different specificities in the
transport of organic anions. they also prompt the challenging suggestion that  xxxg15xxx , in addition to its established
function in the liver, plays a key role in the active secretion
of organic acid pharmacons in other tissues, such as in the
kidney proximal tubules.
in the present study, the effects of gsh on  xxxg13xxx  and
 xxxg15xxx , respectively, also showed some basic differences. although  xxxg13xxx -atpase was efficiently activated by gsh concentrations corresponding to the cellular levels of this peptide (2–10 mm),  xxxg15xxx -atpase was much less sensitive to
gsh. ltc4, nem-gs, or methotrexate transport did not
require the presence of gsh in the case of either  xxxg13xxx  or
 xxxg15xxx , and no significant effect of gsh could be observed on
the rate of nem-gs uptake. still, an additive effect of gsh
on both  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  atpase activities with  xxxd3256xxx  or probenecid and a synergistic stimulation of the  xxxg13xxx 
atpase by indomethacin and gsh were observed.
concerning the role of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  in cytostatic drug
resistance, it has been documented in several experiments
that both proteins are able to transport unconjugated hydrophobic drugs and anions (feller et al., 1995; versantvoort et
al., 1995; holló et al., 1996), but gsh modifies this transport,
most likely via a cotransport mechanism (loe et al., 1996b,
1998; deeley and cole, 1997; evers et al., 1998). in experiments to be reported elsewhere, we found that vinblastine
and gsh produced a synergistic stimulation of the mrp2atpase (manuscript under preparation).
all of these results suggest a combined, or at least interactively modulated, atp-dependent transport of gsh and
other mrp substrates, and these interactions seem to be
different at various gsh and other substrate concentrations.
based on the present results, the question of the mechanistic
features of these interactions cannot be properly addressed.
still, all of these data, especially the activation of nem-gs
transport by various monovalent organic anions, strongly
suggest the presence of multiple and cooperative drug-binding sites in both mrps studied. various cotransport or allosteric activation models should be tested in further, similar,
but more elaborate experiments.
in summary, we efficiently applied the sf9 cell membrane
expression of  xxxg13xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  to compare the transport and
atpase properties of these two proteins and found significant differences in their substrate interactions. the test system used here should allow the examination of a large variety of pharmacologically important compounds to estimate
their interactions with these promiscuous transporters.
based on direct transport studies or substrate-stimulated
atpase measurements, we suggest that anionic compounds
like methotrexate, probenecid,  xxxd3256xxx , furosemide,
indomethacin, and  xxxd2871xxx  are actively transported by
 xxxg15xxx , and this transport may have important relevance to
the physiological elimination of these widely used therapeutic agents in the liver and the kidney. the observed transport
