2001.—to test the role of epithelial na channels in the
day-to-day regulation of renal na excretion, rats were infused via osmotic minipumps with the na channel blocker
amiloride at rates that achieved drug concentrations of 2–5
␮m in the lumen of the distal nephron. daily na excretion
rates were unchanged, although amiloride-treated animals
tended to excrete more na in the afternoon and less in the
late evening than controls. when the rats were given a
low-na diet, na excretion rates were elevated in the amiloride-treated group within 4 h and remained higher than
controls for at least 48 h. adrenalectomized animals responded similarly to the low-na diet. in contrast, rats infused with  xxxd2983xxx  at rates designed to inhibit nacl
transport in the distal tubule were able to conserve na as
well as did the controls. injection of aldosterone (2 ␮g/100 g
body wt) decreased na excretion in control animals after a
1-h delay. this effect was largely abolished in amiloridetreated rats. on the basis of quantitative analysis of the
results, we conclude that activation of amiloride-sensitive
channels by mineralocorticoids accounts for 50–80% of the
immediate natriuretic response of the kidney to a reduction
in na intake. furthermore, the channels are necessary to
achieve minimal rates of na excretion during more chronic
na deprivation.

it is generally recognized that epithelial na channels
(enac) are important in the overall long-term regulation of na balance and blood pressure. this is illustrated by disease states in which na channels are
defective. mutations in the enac gene that reduce
channel activity lead to the clinical syndrome of
pseudohypoaldosteronism, characterized by salt wasting and hypotension (3, 30). conversely, mutations in
the ␤- or ␥-enac genes that make the channels more
active give rise to liddle’s syndrome, a monogenic form
of hypertension in which na is retained (and k is lost),
despite low levels of mineralocorticoids (29, 34).

however, the precise role of aldosterone and na
channels in the day-to-day maintenance of na balance
has not been established. this is due, in large part, to
the complexities of the regulatory systems involved in
the control of plasma volume and blood pressure. first,
changes in na excretion (unav) can be brought about
not only by changes in aldosterone levels but also by
other hormones that affect the kidney. these include
atrial natriuretic factor, the levels of which can decrease in response to volume contraction, and  xxxg99xxx , which will vary in parallel with aldosterone
and can affect the kidney directly (11). second, there
are multiple effects of these factors on the kidney
through which unav can be altered. atrial natriuretic
factor can change glomerular filtration rate (gfr) and,
perhaps, also decrease na reabsorption in the inner
medulla through inhibition of na-cl cotransport or
nonselective cation channels (18).  xxxg99xxx  can
directly stimulate na reabsorption in the proximal and
distal nephrons (6, 33). decreased blood pressure can
enhance na retention via sympathetic nerve signals or
through direct effects on the kidney (11). finally, aldosterone itself may have multiple mechanisms and sites
of action. in addition to its effects on na channels (24),
it can induce higher levels of the thiazide-sensitive
 xxxg2080xxx  in the distal convoluted tubule
(16). it can also activate na/h exchange in cultured
renal cells through a nongenomic mechanism (20).
several studies have demonstrated the activation of
na channels in the rat cortical collecting tubule (cct)
in response to chronic na deprivation (24, 26, 31).
previously, we reported that reduction of na intake
over a period of only 15 h leads to a substantial activation of na channels that could account for most of
the observed increase in renal na reabsorption (9).
here, we test this concept further by using a pharmacological “knockout” of the na channels in the distal
nephron. the results suggest two roles of na channel
activation: 1) they contribute to the immediate naconserving response, accounting for ⱖ50% of the initial
fall in unav, and 2) they lower the minimal level of
unav by ⬃10-fold.

na channels and acute na deprivation

methods

animals. female sprague-dawley rats (120–180 g) raised
free of viral infections (charles river laboratories, kingston,
ny) were fed a low-na diet (3.8 mg na/kg, 8.6 g k/kg; icn,
cleveland, oh) or a matched control diet to which nacl (10
g/kg) was added. average consumption of food was 12 g/day
for both diets. na intake was ⬃2,100 meq/day on the control
diet and essentially zero on the low-na diet. some animals
were implanted subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps
(model 2002, alza, palo alto, ca) to deliver amiloride (research biochemicals, natick, ma; 30 nmol/h) and/or  xxxd2983xxx  (ptz; us pharmacopeia, rockville, md; 15 nmol/h). the
drugs were dissolved in  xxxd2982xxx  300 at concentrations calculated to give the desired infusion rate according to
the pumping rate specified by the manufacturer. in some
experiments, rats were injected subcutaneously with a single
dose of  xxxd103xxx  (2 ␮g/100 g body wt). to measure
urinary excretion rates, animals were kept individually in
metabolic cages (nalge nunc, rochester, ny) with free access
to food and water. between 0800 and 1200, the rats were kept
without food but with free access to drinking water lightly
sweetened with 3% sucrose to increase water intake and
urine flow. adrenalectomized and sham-operated control rats
were obtained from charles river laboratories.
analytic methods. rats were anesthetized with  xxxd2604xxx , and blood was obtained from the abdominal aorta.
na and k were measured in plasma and urine by flame
photometry (model 943, instrumentation laboratory, lexington, ma). urine ca and cl were measured colorimetrically
with arsenazo iii and mercuric thiocyanate, respectively,
using commercial kits (sigma diagnostics, st. louis, mo).
creatinine was measured with a commercial kit (sigma diagnostics) by a colorimetric method based on that described
by heinegard and tiderstrom (13). only female rats were
used for creatinine clearance measurements, because creatinine is not secreted by the kidney in the female rat (12).
urine amiloride was measured fluorometrically according to
baer et al. (1).
urine ptz was analyzed by hplc. the instrument (waters, milford, ma) included a system controller (model 600e),
a photodiode array detector (model 996), and an injector
(model u16k) and was operated under millenium software. a
reverse-phase c18 column (model 201tp54, vydac) was used
as the stationary phase; a concentration gradient of 20 mm
ammonium acetate, ph 5.4 (solvent a), and acetonitrile (solvent b) was used as the mobile phase. the column was
equilibrated at 100% solvent a before injection. after injection, solvent b was increased linearly to 20% over the first 2.5
min and then to 40% over the following 30 min. the flow rate
was 1 ml/min. under this gradient, ptz had a retention time
of 23.2 min and was well separated from other compounds
present in urine in chromatograms obtained with the detector set at 269 nm. a calibration curve of peak area vs. ptz
over the range 100–1,000 ng was linear and was used to
calculate the amount of the drug in urine.
statistics. statistical analysis of time course data was done
by anova or repeated-measures anova, with post hoc
comparisons made using the tukey-kramer test. in cases
where unav decreased substantially, this method of analysis
was insensitive to differences between groups that were large
in relative terms but small in absolute terms. in these cases,
we did two types of analysis. in the first, we used t-tests with
correction for multiple comparisons. the p values required
for significance were 0.05/n, where n is the number of comparisons in a given experiment. in the second method, we
calculated means and standard deviations for the ratios of
ajp-renal physiol • vol

treated to control groups. we then performed anova on
these ratios and tested for significant differences with respect
to baseline values, which were close to 1. figures 1–9 report
results of the first test, which was more stringent than the
second.
results

a major goal in this study was to develop an animal
model in which renal na channel function was abolished. our approach was pharmacological. we aimed to
infuse the na channel blocker amiloride into the rat
through osmotic minipumps at rates that would
achieve steady-state levels in the urine sufficient to
block channels in the distal nephron but to have minimal effects elsewhere. we chose the dose on the basis
of the assumption that ⬃50% of the drug would be
cleared from plasma through urinary excretion (1) by a
combination of glomerular filtration and secretion by
the proximal tubule. we further assumed that rates of
fluid delivery to the channel-expressing parts of the
distal nephron were ⬃60 ␮l/min, corresponding to 10%
of gfr. thus, when the infusion rate was 0.5 nmol/
min, we estimated that 0.25 nmol/min would be excreted in a volume of 60 ␮l/min, giving a concentration
of 4 ␮m in the distal tubular fluid.
direct measurements of amiloride concentration in
the urine confirmed that this estimate was reasonably
correct. figure 1 shows the time course of the rate of
appearance of amiloride in the urine. the drug could be
detected within 1 day after implantation of the
minipump. the rate of excretion of amiloride in the
urine reached a steady state after 2 days. one group of
rats infused with amiloride and given drinking water
sweetened with sucrose to promote drinking showed a
marked water diuresis. measurements of amiloride are
shown in table 1. the concentration in the final urine
was ⬃5 ␮m. if it is assumed that little water was
reabsorbed by the collecting duct under these conditions, this would also represent the approximate concentration in the lumen near the end of the cct. if
fluid delivery to the early part of the collecting duct
system (i.e., the connecting tubule) is 10% of gfr or
⬃60 ␮l/min, the concentration at this point will be ⬃2.6
␮m.
if the inhibition constant (ki) for amiloride is assumed to be 0.1 ␮m (25), 2–5 ␮m will block 95–98% of
the na channel activity in these segments. in contrast,
if amiloride enters the urine primarily by filtration, the
concentration in the glomerular filtrate (and, by inference, in plasma) will be ⬃0.25 ␮m. this would have

amiloride at concentrations up to 100 ␮m (10). thus,
under these conditions, we believe that we can achieve
a reasonably complete and a reasonably specific block
of na channels in the distal nephron in vivo.
figure 1, b and c, shows the initial response of unav
and k excretion (ukv) to amiloride infusion. there was
a significant increase in unav and decrease in ukv
during the first 6 h after implantation of the
minipumps. after that time, the kidneys appeared to
adapt to the presence of the drug, and excretion rates
were similar to those in controls.
as a further test of the efficacy of blocking the channels, we examined the effects of an acute injection of
aldosterone on unav. this hormone increases na reabsorption, at least in part through increases in na
channel activity (28). figure 2 shows the results of the
injection in control and amiloride-treated animals. in
controls, unav remained near basal levels for the first
hour, reflecting the well-established lag time characterizing hormone action. in subsequent 2-h time periods, excretion rates dropped substantially as expected.
somewhat unexpectedly, ukv was not strongly affected by aldosterone with this protocol (fig. 2b), while
cl excretion (uclv) fell in parallel with unav (fig. 2c).
we do not know why ukv was not increased under
these conditions. the reductions in unav and uclv
were significantly attenuated by amiloride. the difference in absolute values of uclv in control and amiloride-treated animals fell short of significance, but the
differences in the fall in individual rats from baseline
to the 10- to 12-h period were significant (p ⫽ 0.013).
even in the presence of amiloride, however, there was
a significant decrease in unav with aldosterone injection. this may reflect a contribution from a hormonedependent transporter other than the channels.
when urine was collected for 4-h periods over 24 h
from control animals, a marked diurnal rhythm for
unav and ukv emerged (fig. 3). peak rates of excretion for both ions occurred during the night and early
morning, corresponding roughly to the highest rates of
food intake. lowest levels of excretion were in the late
afternoon. diurnal variations in unav were somewhat
larger than those for ukv.
figure 3 also shows the pattern obtained with amiloride-infused rats beginning 1 day after implantation of
the minipumps. over this period, the animals were in
approximate na and k balance, and na intake and
24-h excretion rates were similar to those of controls.
there was, however, a small but consistent change in
the diurnal pattern of salt excretion. in the late afternoon (1400 to 1800), when unav reached its lowest
levels, unav was higher in amiloride-treated rats than
in controls. this pattern appeared to reverse during
the night (0200 to 0600), during which unav was
higher in controls. the ratio of unav at the lowest
(1400 to 1800) to highest (0200 to 0600) time points
was significantly lower in controls than in amiloridetreated animals (0.10 ⫾ 0.02 vs. 0.47 ⫾ 0.10, p ⫽
0.014). amiloride did not change the diurnal pattern of
ukv significantly.

values were measured at 24-h baseline, and rats were given a low-na
diet at 1800. urine was collected every 4 h until the following

significantly different from normal after the change in
diet. within 20 h, unav dropped to extremely low
levels, representing ⬍0.005% of the filtered load. ukv
was not noticeably affected (fig. 4b). two effects of
amiloride on the response to the low-na diet are evident. the blocker slowed the initial fall in unav, and
the largest absolute difference in excretion occurred
during the first time interval of na restriction. amiloride also had a large effect on the minimal unav
measured after 16 h. this rate, which persisted for at
least the next 24 h, was ⬃0.08–0.2% of the filtered
load, 20- to 50-fold higher than in controls. in the
presence of amiloride, a small increase in unav during
the second overnight period persisted, despite very low
levels of na intake.

the data from fig. 4 are replotted in fig. 5 as unav
vs. na deficit. these deficits were calculated taking na
intake as zero after the change to the low-na diet. two
phases of the effects of amiloride are evident. first, the
initial fall in unav in response to the deficit is reduced
by ⬃80%. this suggests that a substantial fraction of
increased na reabsorption by the kidney during the
initial response is mediated by na channels. second,
the sharp drop in excretion, which in controls virtually
eliminates unav and limits the deficit to ⬃200 ␮mol,
does not occur. instead, the animals continue to lose
na up to a cumulative deficit of at least 450 ␮mol,
equivalent to ⬃3 ml of extracellular fluid. we did not
continue the experiment beyond this point, but we
suspect that the animals would eventually die of hypovolemic shock. in other experiments, we have maintained untreated rats on the low-na diet for up to 2 wk
with no major deleterious effects. amiloride-sensitive
na channels appear to be essential for survival under
these conditions.
we next investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the reduction in unav in the presence of
amiloride. it is possible that, in the presence of amiloride, plasma volume decreases to such an extent that
gfr is reduced. reduced unav would then result from
a decreased filtered load of na, rather than from increased reabsorption. to test this theory, we measured
creatinine clearance as an estimate of gfr. as shown
in table 2, amiloride had no measurable effect on gfr
under conditions of na restriction. in addition, na
restriction per se did not reduce gfr compared with
animals under na-replete conditions. therefore, the
reduction in unav over the first 24 h of a low-na diet
results from increased na reabsorption in the absence
and presence of amiloride.
increased na reabsorption in the presence of amiloride could be mediated by an aldosterone-upregulated
transport system other than the na channel. to test
this idea, we assessed the reduction in unav in response to dietary na restriction in adrenalectomized
rats. for these and subsequent experiments, we used a

simpler protocol in which just three urine collections
were made: overnight (1800 to 0900), morning (0900 to
1200), and afternoon (1200 to 1800). the results using
this protocol on the effects of amiloride were similar to
those described above and are shown in fig. 6a. the
same protocol comparing control (sham-operated) and
adrenalectomized animals is illustrated in fig. 6b. the
pattern of unav was very similar in the amiloridetreated and adrenalectomized rats. the finding that
the adrenalectomized animals did not excrete more na
than the amiloride-treated group during the first 24 h
of na restriction supports the idea that the effects of
aldosterone over this time period are largely dependent
on activation of amiloride-sensitive na channels. a
caveat to this interpretation is that gfr was reduced
in the na-depleted adrenalectomized animals (table
2). a reduction in filtered load could help compensate
for diminished reabsorption through another transporter.
another possibility is that other transporters are
activated during na depletion by aldosterone-independent mechanisms. one candidate is the  xxxg2080xxx , which is expressed in the distal convoluted
tubule of the rat kidney (21) and is therefore in a good
position to regulate the final composition of urine. we
employed a similar strategy to investigate the possible
role of this transporter. the potent thiazide diuretic
ptz was infused via osmotic minipumps at 250 pmol/
min. ptz measured using hplc was 1–10 ␮m in the
urine at the time of reduction of dietary na, and the
excretion of ptz was highest just after implantation
(70 pmol/min), declining to ⬃30 pmol/min thereafter
(fig. 7a). therefore, in the steady state, ⬃10% of the
drug is excreted intact in the urine. if it is assumed
that gfr is 0.7 ml/min and that 10% of the filtered
fluid is delivered to the distal convoluted tubule, we
estimate that the concentration of the drug at its main
site of action was 0.4 ⫾ 0.1 ␮m at the time of reduction
of na intake. this is at least eight times the ki of ⬍0.05
␮m for ptz’s effects on the cloned  xxxg2080xxx 
under physiological conditions (19). this indicates that
the transporter should be mostly inhibited under these
conditions.

two physiological measurements confirmed the effect of ptzs. first, during the first 6 h after implantation of the minipumps, unav was higher than in controls (fig. 7b). ukv tended to increased during this
period, but the effect was not statistically significant
(fig. 7c). after that time, the excretion rates were
similar in ptz-treated and control groups, suggesting
that the kidneys had adapted to inhibition of the cotransporter. similar results were reported previously
(7). another hallmark of the action of the thiazides on
the distal tubule is a reduction in urinary ca excretion
(ucav). figure 7d shows the effects of ptz infusion on
ucav after implantation of the minipumps. in untreated rats, there was a strong diurnal rhythm of
ucav, with rates much higher in the morning than in
the afternoon. ptz greatly reduced the morning ucav
and strongly blunted the diurnal variations. although

fig. 8. effects of ptz infusion on unav. urine was collected for 24 h
while animals were maintained on a normal-na diet and then for
another 24 h on a low-na diet. a: ptz infusion did not alter pattern
of na excretion compared with sham-operated controls. b: ptz did
not alter pattern of na excretion in amiloride-infused animals. values are means ⫾ se for 7 (a) and 4 (b) pairs of animals. no
significant effect of ptz was observed.

the mechanism by which thiazides stimulate ca absorption is controversial, the effects are thought to be
secondary to inhibition of the  xxxg2080xxx  (8).
thus three observations indicate that drug concentrations high enough to block the cotransporter are
achieved by this protocol.

na channels and acute na deprivation

the effects of ptz on the response to a low-na diet
are shown in fig. 8a. unav values in the controls were
not significantly different from those in the ptztreated group. after 18 h, unav levels were reduced to
⬍0.01% of filtered load. this indicates that the na-cl
cotransporter is not essential in the short-term response to reduced na intake. it is possible that the
cotransporter becomes important when the channels
are blocked. to test this theory, we compared rats
treated with amiloride ⫹ ptz with those treated with
amiloride alone (fig. 8b). again, unav was substantially higher than in controls (cf. fig. 8a), but ptz ⫹
amiloride did not have a marked effect on the excretion
pattern.
we also tested whether the  xxxg2080xxx 
might be involved in the acute response to aldosterone,
as shown in fig. 2. a similar protocol was carried out
using control and ptz-infused animals. there was no
effect of thiazide on the response to aldosterone injection (fig. 9). in this set of experiments, unav in both
groups tended to increase toward basal levels 3–5 h
after the injection. the results are consistent with a
minimal role of the  xxxg2080xxx  in the acute
effects of aldosterone on renal na transport.
the effects of the various conditions on plasma
electrolytes and gfr are shown in table 2. as we
reported previously (7), plasma k increased after
18 h of na restriction. this hyperkalemia was even
greater in the amiloride-treated and adrenalectomized
groups, whereas the ptz-treated animals were hypokalemic. of the protocols used, only adrenalectomy had a
significant impact on gfr.
discussion

pharmacological elimination of na channels. the
pharmacological blockade of na channel activity has
several advantages over the genetic knockout approach
for addressing the questions posed in this study. most
importantly, the administration of the channel blocker
amiloride was limited to a few days, rather than the
lifetime of the animal, avoiding problems of respiratory
failure, which can be lethal in ␣-enac-knockout mice
(15), as well as possible developmental changes and

aldosterone. procotols were similar to those shown in fig. 2. unav
fell to the same extent in ptz-infused and control animals 1–3 h
after a single injection of aldosterone (2 ␮g/100 g body wt sc). values

observed.

adaptations to the missing transport activity. we also
took advantage of the fact that the drug is cleared from
the body largely by excretion in the urine, so that it
was naturally concentrated in the lumen of the distal
nephron, exactly the place where we wanted it to act.
finally, the technique could be conveniently used in
the rat, an animal in which a great deal of information
about renal function, in general, and na channel activity, in particular, is known.
a major disadvantage of the pharmacological approach is that the drugs have limited specificities. of
particular concern in our study was the finding that
amiloride can inhibit a variety of na transport processes in addition to the na channels, including na/h
and na/ca exchange (2, 17). much larger doses are
needed to affect these transporters, however, and concentrations in the low micromolar range will block
most of the channel activity (ki ⬃ 10⫺7 m) with minimal effects on the exchangers (ki ⬃ 10⫺4 m). as mentioned above, the tendency for amiloride to be concentrated in the urine in the distal nephron, where the
channels are located, relative to the proximal tubular
fluid, where the na/h exchanger mediates na reabsorption, will augment the effective specificity of the
drug for the channels.
the kidney can adapt to treatment with diuretics.
although baseline unav levels (figs. 2, 4, 6, and 8)
were similar in control and amiloride- or thiazidetreated animals, in the latter groups loss of one transporter activity may be compensated for by upregulation of others. this adaptation probably explains why
unav was increased during the first 6 h of thiazide
infusion, but not at later times.
diurnal patterns of excretion. the diurnal rhythm of
unav has been reported previously. holtzman et al.
(14) found that unav in the rat fell to a low basal level
in the late  xxxd2476xxx  food intake diminishes. the
diurnal variation was reduced when intake was spread
out over the day. in our study, ukv also exhibited a
diurnal pattern that was less marked than that for
unav. the smaller variation in k output may reflect
the ability of the intracellular compartment to buffer
changes in extracellular k resulting from k intake.
changes in na channel activity seem to account in
part for the diurnal pattern. wang et al. (32) reported
that urinary na-to-k ratios in the mouse were higher
in the morning than in the afternoon and that these
changes were well correlated with the amiloride-sensitive potential difference across the distal colon, measured in vivo. a similar diurnal pattern was reported
for the short-circuit current and the density of amiloride-sensitive na channels in the rabbit colon, measured in vitro (5). in agreement with these results, we
found that amiloride-infused animals excreted more
na than did controls in the late afternoon, when excretion rates were lowest. this suggests that channelmediated na reabsorption contributes to a reduction in
unav during this time period. however, the diurnal
rhythm, although blunted, persists in the amilorideinfused animals, indicating that other processes are
also involved.

na channels and acute na deprivation

increased channel activity in the late afternoon may
be driven by higher levels of circulating aldosterone (5,
32). these changes could reflect differences in the rate
of salt intake as food consumption decreased markedly
during the day. however, a small nocturnal natriuresis
was observed in amiloride-treated animals, even when
the diet was na free (fig. 4a). this suggests that part
of the increased unav during the night is driven by an
inherent circadian rhythm or by the intake of food in
general, rather than na specifically.
na channels in the response to low na. we previously
found that na channels in the rat cct were activated
after 15–18 h of dietary na restriction (9). a quantitative assessment suggested that the channels could
account for a substantial fraction of the measured
increase in na reabsorption observed during this time
interval in the na-depleted state. this conclusion, however, was based on the assumption that the channels in
the cct in vivo could conduct na at essentially maximal rates. this might not be true if, for example, na
delivery to the distal nephron were diminished and the
luminal na concentration fell below saturation levels.
the main goal of this study was to use an independent
test to evaluate this possibility. we used the amilorideinfused rat model to examine whether blocking the
channels did indeed increase unav under these conditions and, if so, to what extent.
it is clear that without the channels the ability of the
kidney to conserve na was reduced. the effects of
blocking the channels were observed in the first few
hours after na intake was reduced, when the largest
absolute amiloride-sensitive na reabsorption occurred.
it is also evident that unav is reduced, even in the
presumed absence of functional channels. a more
quantitative conclusion is more difficult to reach, because, in the presence of the inhibitor, more na is lost
over the same time period, leading to a greater na
deficit and perhaps to the recruitment of other saltconserving processes. one method of quantifying the
role of the channels is therefore to compare the effect of
amiloride on unav at similar degrees of na depletion.
this type of plot is shown in fig. 5. the initial negative
slope of the relationship of excretion vs. na deficit is
reduced by ⬃80% in the presence of amiloride. this
suggests that a large fraction (⬎50%) of the increased
na reabsorption in response to a reduction in na intake is mediated by the na channels. this supports the
conclusions based on direct measurements of channel
activity.
a similarly large fraction of the response to an acute
injection of aldosterone was abolished in the amilorideinfused animals. this finding, together with the observation that adrenalectomy and amiloride treatment
affected unav to a similar extent, is consistent with the
involvement of mineralocorticoids in the early na-conserving process.
the effects of amiloride on unav after longer periods
(⬎16 h) of na deprivation were perhaps even more
dramatic. in control animals, na reabsorption increased markedly as the cumulative na deficit approached ⬃200 ␮mol. after 16 h of salt restriction,

unav virtually ceased and the animals survived the
nearly complete absence of dietary na for long periods
of time. this ability to adapt to very low levels of salt
intake is severely compromised when na channels are
blocked, and the animals continue to lose na at significant rates. we conclude that the channels are essential to keep na losses below ⬃0.1% of the filtered load.
na-cl cotransporters in the response to low na. under normal conditions, the thiazide-sensitive na-cl
cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule is
thought to reabsorb a large fraction of the filtered load
(27). in addition, chronic na depletion increased levels
of cotransporter protein, indicating a role at least in
long-term na conservation. administration of ptz, a
potent thiazide diuretic, at levels sufficient to block the
cotransporter, resulted in a transient increase in unav
and a chronic decrease in ucav. during short-term na
deprivation, the kidneys were able to reduce unav
normally, despite the presence of the blocker. this
result should be interpreted with caution, since the
kidney can adapt to thiazide administration by upregulating levels of the cotransporter itself (4) as well as
those of the na channels (22). we do not eliminate the
possibility that the cotransporter is involved in the
short-term response to na deprivation. however, it
does not appear to be as essential as the na channels in
reducing unav to minimal levels.
other transport systems involved in acute regulation
of unav. even in the presence of amiloride, the kidney
can reduce unav substantially, from ⬃1–2% of filtered
load under control conditions to ⬃0.1% with low na
intake. we do not know the processes that are involved
in this response or whether they take place even when
na channels are active. gfr is not significantly
changed after 15 h of low na, even in the presence of
amiloride (table 2). thus the decrease in excretion
depends on an increase in na reabsorption. as discussed above, the thiazide-sensitive cotransporter is
not essential for this additional reabsorption, although
it may contribute to it under normal conditions. a more
likely candidate would be the na/h exchanger in the
proximal tubule. this exchanger is known to be stimulated by  xxxg99xxx , and levels of this hormone
presumably rise during na depletion. a genetic knockout of the renal  xxxg99xxx  receptor does indeed
interfere with na conservation by the mouse kidney,
despite normal increases in plasma aldosterone (23). it
is not known to what extent this effect involves
changes in tubular transport or in renal hemodynamics. if  xxxg99xxx -dependent na reabsorption in the
proximal tubule were activated during na restriction,
delivery of na to the distal nephron would be reduced,
accounting for the low rates of unav, even in the
absence of functioning na channels.
