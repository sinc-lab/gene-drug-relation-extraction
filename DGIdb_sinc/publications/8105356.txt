summary
the effects of catecholamines on ciliary motility of canine bronchial epithelium was
studied by a photoelectric method in vitro. addition of [~-adrcnoceptor agonists
increased ciliary beat frcquency, a rank order of potency being salbutamol :,. brl
37344, a selective 153-adrenoccptor agonist > norcpinephrine. the response to brl
37344 was relatively resistant to thc blockade of 1~1- and 1~2-adrenoccptors but was
competitively antagonized by the [~3-adrenoceptor antagonist cyanopindolol, with the
pa2 value being lower than that when salbutamol was used as an agonist. these results
suggest that 133-adrenoccptors exist in canine bronchial epithelium and that stimulation of
this receptor subtype may enhance ciliary motility and, hence, mucociliary transport in
the airway.

i~-adrenergic receptors have been classified based on the pharmacological criteria into two subtypes, [31
and [32, both of which are present in the canine (1) and human (2) airways from trachea to terminal
bronchioles. in airway epithelial cells, adrencrgic stimulation can increase ciliary motility (3) and ci
secretion (4) probably through 1~2-adrenergic receptors and the subsequent accumulation of intracellular
 xxxd1773xxx . on the other hand, existence of additional subtypes of ~-adrenoccptors, so-called '[~3"
adrenoceptors', have recently been found in a variety of tissues including adipocytes (5),
gastrointestinal smooth muscle (6) and myocardium (7), but it remains unknown whether this receptor
subtype is present in airways. therefore, in the present study, we measured ciliary beat frequency

(cbf) of canine cultured bronchial epithelium in response to norepincphrine (sankyo, tokyo, japan),
the selective 1~2-adrcnoceptor agonist salbutamol (sigma, st. louis, mo), and the selective [~3adrenoceptor agonist brl 37344 (sodium-4-[2-[2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl) ethylamino] propyl]
phenoxyacetate, beecham, tokyo) (5) by a photoelectric method in vitro.

methods

preparation of tissues
mongrel dogs wcrc anesthetized with sodium pcntobarbital (35 mg/kg). the lobar bronchi were
removed and the mucosa was dissected, cut into small pieces (1-2 mm3), rinsed with dulbecco's
phosphate-buffered saline, and placed on a microscope covcrglass. because a photometric method
requires the preparation to be thin so as to the light can pass through and reach a photometer (8), we
cultured organ explant and the outgrowth of eiliated cells ,,,,'ere served tbr the measurement of cbf. to
do so, tissues were incubated in medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °c in a co 2
incubator for 7 days, and a microscope covcrglass on which tissues were adhered was mounted in a
rose chamber (9).

photoelectric method
in measuring cbf of epithelium, wc adopted a photoelectric method by using a microscope
(nikon, optiphoto-xe tokyo) equipped with a phase-contrast condenser and an on-base type of
halogen illuminator, to the head of which the photometer (hamamatsu photonies,  xxxd2692xxx -ii,
hamamatsu, japan) with a built-in pcriplanatic eyepiece, a limiting aperture, and a lateral tbeusing
telescope were attached. because of the beating action of cilia, light from the illuminator passed
through the preparation in varying intensities, which were detected and transduced to voltage impulses
by the photometer and continuously recorded on a pen recorder (10).

effects of fl-adrenoceptor ag(mists on cbf
the preparation was allowed to stabilize for 30 min in krebs-henseleit solution. after determining
the baseline cbe medium was drained off the chamber and replaced with krcbs-henscleit solution
containing either norepincphrine, salbutamol or brl 37344 at a concentration of 10.5 m, and cbf was
measured for the next 30 min. to examine a concentration-response relationship, each of the [~adrcnoceptor agonists was cumulatively added in a half-molar increments ( i0 -10-10 .5 m) to the chamber
and the highest recorded value in response to each concentration was determined. we then determined
the negative logarithm of molar concentration of each agonist required to produce 50% of the
salbutamol maximum response (pd2) by linear regression analysis.
in the following studies,  xxxd2914xxx  and ici 89406  xxxd1891xxx -6 m were present in the chamber to
avoid ct- and [~l-adrcncrgic effects, respectively (11). to evaluate the effects of [~-adrenoceptor
antagonists, concentration-response curves tbr salbutamol and brl 37344 in the absence and presence
of ici 118551 (10 -8-10 .6 m), a selective [~2-adrcnoceptor antagonist ( 1 l), or cyanopindolol (10 -8-10-6
m), a potent competitive antagonist for [~3-adrenoccptors (12). schild plots were then generated by
plotting log (cr - 1) against log [antagonist], where cr was the ratio of the agonist-pd 2 in the absence
and presence of the antagonist. if the slope of the linear rcgression line of the plots was not

significantly different from unity, antagonism was considered to be competitive. in these cases a mean
pa 2 value (negative logarithm of molar concentration of an antagonist causing two-fold shift in an
agonistconcentration-response curve) was obtained from individual estimates using the following
formula : pa 2 = log (cr - 1) - log [antagonist] after first verifying that there was no significant
regression of pa 2 on antagonist concentration. in cases where the slope of schild plot was
significantly different from unity, apparent pa 2 values were estimated from a single antagonist
concentration and the above equation.

statistics
all values were expressed as means -+ se. statistical analysis was performed by unpaired
student's t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
addition of each ~-adrenoceptor agonist rapidly increased cbe which peaked within 5 min and
gradually declined during the next 30 min (fig. 1). this effect was concentration-dependent with the
pd 2 values for salbutamol, brl 37344 and norepinephrine being 7.03 -,- 0.34, 6.95 --. 0.27 and 6.02 ±
0.25 (n = 9 in each case), respectively, thus giving a rank order potency of salbutamol (1) ~ brl
37344 (0.84) > norepinephrine (0.10) (fig. 2).

dependent manner, where the pa 2 value was 8.32 __.0.13 (n = 9) and this antagonism was compctitivc
in nature (fig. 3). in contrast, ici 118551 only weakly inhibited thc responsc to brl 37344, with an
apparent pa 2 calculated on the basis of thc antagonist (10 -6 m)-induced shift being 6.41.
cyanopindolol antagonized the effect of salbutamol with a pa 2 value of 8.27 + 0.14 (n = 8, fig. 4).
the response to brl 37344 was also antagonized by cyanopindolol in a concentration-dependcnt
manner, where the antagonism was competitive because the slope of the schild plot was not
significantly different from unity (1.07 _* 0.11, n = 10) and the pa 2 value was 7.53 +_. 0.09. the
difference between the pa 2 values for cyanopindolol against salbutamol and brl 37344 was
statistically significant (p < 0.01).

discussion
this study demonstrate that, in addition to classical [~2-adrenoceptors, atypical 15-adrenocepto~
(l~3-adrenoceptors) may be present in canine airway epithelial cells. we came to this conclusion as
follows. first, brl 37344, which is the most selective agonist for [53-adrenoceptors and is less
effective and almost ineffective on 132- and [51-adrcnoceptors, respectivcly (5), was approximately
equipment with salbutamol in increasing cbf in the epithelium. similar findings have been shown in
rat adipocytes (5) and guinea pig gastrointestinal muscle (6). second, in contrast to the effective
antagonism of the salbutamol action by the 132-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118551 ( l l ) , the brl
37344-induced increase in cbf was only weakly antagonized by this agent under the condition that ct-

and [~l-adrenoceptors were blocked by  xxxd2914xxx  and ici 89406, respectively. this low affinity for
ici 118551 again suggests the presence of [33-adrenoceptors (6, 13). third, cyanopindolol, an agent
that has been shown to potently antagonize [33-adrenoceptors (6, 12), antagonized the effect of brl
37344 in a competitive manner. finally, the pa 2 value for cyanopindolol against brl 37344 was
significantly different from the value obtained with salbutamol as an agonist, suggesting that brl
37344 may interact wi,h airway epithelial fs-adrenoccptors in a way different from salbutamol probably
through 1~3-adrenoceptors (14).

although the physiological significance of 133-adrenoceptors remains to be elucidated, the existence
of this receptor subtype has been identified in a variety of tissues and emorine and colleagues (15)
recently isolated a human gene that encodes a product referred to as l~3-adrenoceptors. since the
beating action of airway cilia plays an important role in the lung defence mechanism by clearing the
mucosa from inhaled particles, bacteria and cellular debris (16), stimulation of ciliary motility mediated
by the selective [~,3-adrenoceptor agonist might be of value to improve mucociliary transport function in
the respiratory tract.
