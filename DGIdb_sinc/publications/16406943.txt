purpose: we characterized the binding affinities of several antimuscarinic agents in human muscarinic receptors.
materials and methods: competitive inhibitory effects of antimuscarinic agents on specific nms [3h] (perkinelmer life
sciences, boston, massachusetts) binding were examined in human tissue homogenates and in cho-k1 cell membranes
expressing human muscarinic receptor subtypes.
results: oxybutynin, propiverine,  xxxd3398xxx , the respective metabolites deob, dpr-p-4(n¡o) and 5-hm, and  xxxd1813xxx 
inhibited in concentration dependent fashion specific [3h]nms binding in homogenates of the human bladder and parotid
gland as well as in membranes of cho-k1 cell lines expressing human muscarinic m1 to  xxxg451xxx  subtypes. based on
inhibition constant values the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm and dpr-p-4(n¡o) were 1.4 to 1.7 times greater in the
bladder than in the parotid gland, whereas the inhibitory effects of oxybutynin, deob, propiverine and  xxxd1813xxx  were 2
to 10 times greater in the parotid gland. consequently  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm and dpr-p-4(n¡o) compared with oxybutynin,
deob, propiverine and  xxxd1813xxx  were found to show 3 to 4 times greater affinity to muscarinic receptors in the human
bladder than in the parotid gland.  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm were 2-fold more potent for inhibiting specific [3h]nms binding at
cell membranes expressing the m2 vs the m3 subtype. conversely oxybutynin, deob, propiverine, dpr-p-4(n¡o) and
 xxxd1813xxx  showed 2 to 22 times higher affinity to the m3 than to the m2 subtype.
conclusions: compared with oxybutynin,  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm and dpr-p-4(n¡o) may bind more selectively to muscarinic
receptors in the human bladder than in the parotid gland.

treatment of overactive bladder with a lesser incidence of dry
mouth than oxybutynin.5,6
oxybutynin, propiverine and  xxxd3398xxx  are metabolized
in the intestine and/or liver. their pharmacologically active
metabolites deob, dpr-p-4(n¡o) and 5-hm, respectively,
seem to be responsible partly or largely for the anticholinergic activities of parent compounds.7–9 although the muscarinic receptor binding activities of oxybutynin and deob
have been briefly examined in the human bladder and parotid gland,10 to our knowledge little data on other anticholinergic agents regarding muscarinic receptor binding
activities in human tissues are available. considering the
widespread uses of oxybutynin, propiverine and  xxxd3398xxx 
to treat overactive bladder it seems to be of clinical significance to comprehensively compare relative binding affinities
of these antimuscarinic agents and their metabolites in human muscarinic receptors. thus, we simultaneously examined the muscarinic receptor binding affinities of
antimuscarinic agents in tissue homogenates of human
bladder and parotid gland as well as in recombinant human
muscarinic m1 to  xxxg451xxx  subtypes (fig. 1).

he family of muscarinic receptors consists of the 5 subtypes m1 to m5, which are encoded by 5 distinct genes.1
using a molecular approach of mrna expression of
muscarinic receptor subtypes it has been suggested that all
muscarinic receptor subtypes are present in the normal human
bladder.2 contractile activity in the human detrusor muscles is
mediated by acetylcholine and it has been considered that the
muscarinic receptor population involved is mainly of the m2
and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes.3,4 it is also believed that most side
effects frequently occurring following oral oxybutynin are
caused by significant binding of the drug to muscarinic receptors in other organs, eg the salivary gland. thus, the therapeutic effect and dry mouth caused by antimuscarinic agents in
patients with overactive bladder are mainly based on the
blockade of muscarinic receptors in the bladder and salivary
gland, respectively. propiverine and  xxxd3398xxx  are considered
as relatively bladder selective anticholinergic agents for the

human muscarinic receptor binding
muscarinic receptor binding assay. the binding assay
for muscarinic receptors was performed using [3h]nms, as
previously described.11 human tissue homogenates and
cho-k1 cell membranes were incubated with different concentrations (0.03 to 2.0 nm) of [3h]nms in 30 mm na⫹/
hepes buffer (ph 7.5). incubation was performed for 60
minutes at 25c. the reaction was terminated by rapid filtration using a cell harvester (brandel, gaithersburg, maryland)
through whatman gf/b glass fiber filters and the filters were
then rinsed 3 times with 3 ml ice-cold buffer. tissue bound
radioactivity was extracted from the filters by placing them
overnight by immersion in scintillation fluid and radioactivity
was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. specific
[3h]nms binding was determined experimentally from the
difference between counts in the absence and presence of 1 ␮m
atropine. all assays were done in duplicate. the protein concentration was measured according to the method of lowry et
al.12

specimens of normal part of the human bladder were
obtained from 2 males and 6 females 46 to 70 years old
without neurogenic bladder who underwent total cystectomy
due to bladder cancer. specimens of a normal part of the
parotid gland were obtained from 3 males and 2 females 63
to 72 years old who underwent surgical excision of parotid
tumors. full informed consent was obtained from each patient. all tissues used in the experiments, including bladder
detrusor muscle containing apparently normal urothelium,
were taken from areas macroscopically free from tumors,
immediately frozen and stored at ⫺80c.
this study was performed according to guidelines approved by the ethical committee of university of shizuoka,
university of yamanashi and hamamatsu university of
medical school. informed consent was obtained from patients before the operations.
tissue preparation. tissues were minced with a pair of
scissors and homogenized by a kinematica polytron® homogenizer in 19 volumes of ice-cold 30 mm na⫹/hepes
buffer (ph 7.5). the homogenates were filtered through 3
layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 40,000 ⫻ gravity for
20 minutes. the resulting pellet was centrifuged again under similar conditions and the pellets were finally resuspended in ice-buffer for the binding assay. the membrane
preparations of stable cho-k1 cell lines expressing human
muscarinic m1 to m5 subtype receptors (euroscreen, brussels, belgium) were diluted by ice-cold 30 mm na⫹/hepes
buffer (ph 7.5).

data analysis. as described previously,13 kd and bmax for
[3h]nms were estimated by rosenthal analysis of the saturation data. the ability of antimuscarinic agents to inhibit
specific [3h]nms binding was estimated from ic50 values,
namely the molar concentration of unlabeled drug necessary
to displace 50% of the specific binding of [3h]nms. ki was
calculated using the equation, ki ⫽ ic50/(1 ⫹ l/kd), where l
is the concentration of [3h]nms in human tissue homogenates (0.95 nm) and cell membranes (0.50 nm). the ki value
expresses the potency of antimuscarinic agents in competing
for [3h]nms binding sites in human tissues and cell membranes. actually ki reflects the binding affinity of antimuscarinic agents to muscarinic receptors, that is lower values
have higher affinity to receptors.13
statistical analysis of the data were performed by 1-way
anova, followed by dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons or by student’s t test when appropriate with p ⬍0.05
considered statistically significant.
results
characterization of muscarinic receptor sites in the
human bladder and parotid gland. specific binding of
[3h]nms in homogenates of the human bladder and parotid
gland increased in concentration dependent fashion and it
appeared to be saturated at around 1.38 nm. scatchard
analysis revealed a linear plot in each tissues, suggesting a
single population of high affinity binding sites (fig. 2). the
calculated kd value for specific [3h]nms binding in the
parotid gland compared with the bladder was significantly
lower (p ⬍0.05), while bmax was approximately 2.7 times
higher. these values of kd and bmax in human tissues were
not much different from previously reported values of
[3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate.10,14
inhibition by antimuscarinic agents of specific
[3h]nms binding in the human bladder and parotid
gland. each agent competed with [3h]nms for binding
sites in homogenates of human bladder and parotid gland in
a concentration dependent manner (fig. 3). as determined by
their ki values, the rank order of these antimuscarinic
agents in the bladder was 5-hm ⬇  xxxd3398xxx  ⬎ deob ⬎
oxybutynin ⬇  xxxd1813xxx  ⬎ dpr-p-4(n¡o) ⬎ propiverine
(table 1). thus,  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm showed significantly

higher affinity for bladder [3h]nms binding sites than all
other agents except deob (p ⬍0.05). in fact, the affinity of
 xxxd3398xxx  was 1.6, 8.0, 9.8, 73 and 228 times higher than
that of deob, oxybutynin,  xxxd1813xxx , dpr-p-4(n¡o) and
propiverine, respectively. the metabolites 5-hm, deob and
dpr-p-4(n¡o) were 1.6, 5.0 and 3.1 times more potent for
inhibiting bladder [3h]nms binding, respectively, than each
parent agent. in the parotid gland the rank order was deob
⬎5-hm,  xxxd3398xxx ,  xxxd1813xxx  ⬎ oxybutynin ⬎ propiverine, dpr-p-4(n¡o) (table 1). in fact, the affinity of deob in
this tissue compared with other agents was 1.3 to 1.7 (5-hm,
 xxxd1813xxx  and  xxxd3398xxx ), 4.2 (oxybutynin), 132 (propiverine) and 144 (dpr-p-4(n¡o)) times higher. also, 5-hm
and deob were 1.4 and 4.2 times more potent, respectively,
for inhibiting [3h]nms binding than each parent agent and
the affinity of dpr-p-4(n¡o) was comparable to that of
propiverine. hill coefficients were close to unity for all
agents except  xxxd1813xxx .
the ratio of the parotid gland ki value to the bladder ki
value determined by the inhibitory effect by antimuscarinic
agents of specific [3h]nms binding was calculated as a measure of selectivity. muscarinic receptor binding affinities of
5-hm,  xxxd3398xxx  and dpr-p-4(n¡o) were 1.4 to 1.7 times
greater in the bladder than in the parotid gland. conversely
those of oxybutynin, deob, propiverine and  xxxd1813xxx  were
2.4, 2.0, 2.2 and 9.5 times, respectively, greater in the parotid
gland (table 1). consequently 5-hm,  xxxd3398xxx  and dpr-p4(n¡o) compared with oxybutynin, deob, propiverine and
 xxxd1813xxx  were found to show 3 to 4 times greater affinity
( xxxd1813xxx  17 times greater) to muscarinic receptors in the
human bladder than in the parotid gland.
affinities to recombinant human muscarinic receptor subtypes. antimuscarinic agents inhibited specific
[3h]nms binding in the membranes of cho-k1 cell lines
expressing human muscarinic m1 to  xxxg451xxx  subtypes in
a concentration dependent manner.  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm
were relatively potent in inhibiting specific [3h]nms binding at cell membranes expressing the m1, m2 and m5 subtypes compared to the m3 and m4 subtypes, and their
potencies were significantly about 3-fold greater at the m2
than at the m3 subtype (table 2). also, 5-hm compared with
 xxxd3398xxx  showed 2.0 to 2.5 times higher affinity at the m1
to m3 subtypes. in contrast, oxybutynin and deob were
more potent for inhibiting specific [3h]nms binding at cell

367

membranes expressing the m3 and m4 subtypes than the m1
to m5 subtypes, while deob showed 1.9 to 3.1 times higher
affinity than oxybutynin for the m1 and m3 to m5 subtypes
(table 2). similarly propiverine and dpr-p-4(n¡o) showed
relatively higher affinity to the m3 subtype than to the other
subtypes.  xxxd1813xxx  inhibited more potently specific
[3h]nms binding at cell membranes expressing the m1, m3
and m5 subtypes than at the m2 and m4 subtypes. thus,
oxybutynin, deob, propiverine, dpr-p-4(n¡o) and  xxxd1813xxx  showed 2.3, 4.7, 2.0, 1.8 and 22.4 times, respectively,
higher affinity to the m3 than to the m2 subtype.
discussion
we compared the binding affinities of oxybutynin, propiverine,  xxxd3398xxx  and their metabolites, which are most widely
used for the treatment of overactive bladder, in muscarinic
receptors in human native tissues and in human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes.
waldeck10 and batra14 et al noted 2 to 3 times higher
affinity of oxybutynin and deob to muscarinic receptors in the
human parotid gland than in the bladder with similar affinity
of the 2 agents in the bladder. in the current study it was
notable that deob showed 4 to 5 times higher affinity to
muscarinic receptors in these human tissues than oxybutynin.

inasmuch as the area under the curve of deob compared with
oxybutynin was 5 to 11 times larger in the plasma of patients
receiving oral oxybutynin15 it is anticipated that this metabolite contributes largely to the appearance of the pharmacological effects of oral oxybutynin. in particular greater selectivity
of deob to muscarinic receptors in the parotid gland over the
bladder may substantiate this metabolite as the causative factor of the high incidence of dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder who are receiving oral oxybutynin.16
although nilvebrant et al observed that the muscarinic receptor binding affinities of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm were 1.8 times
greater in the guinea pig bladder than in the parotid gland,6,9 to
our knowledge the receptor binding affinities of these agents in
human tissues have been little reported. the affinities of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm in human bladder receptors are in reasonable
agreement with their pharmacological potencies (pa2 values) to
antagonize the carbachol induced contraction of isolated human
detrusor muscles (table 1).17 a 2-fold higher plasma concentration
of 5-hm than  xxxd3398xxx  was reportedly detected in patients with
overactive bladder receiving oral  xxxd3398xxx .18 therefore, the
bladder receptor selectivity of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm may partly
underlie the significantly lower incidence of dry mouth in patients
with overactive bladder who are receiving  xxxd3398xxx  vs oxybutynin.16
m3 subtypes are predominantly present in the salivary
gland in all species, including humans, and m2 and m3 subtypes coexist in the human bladder.3,4 furthermore, in the
bladder there are some reports of similar expression of mrna
for the m2 and m3 subtypes,19 and the predominance of either
subtype.4,20 in other words the current study revealed a similar rank order of potency of antimuscarinic agents in membranes of cho-k1 cell lines expressing human m2 and m3
subtypes as that in human tissues, ie for the m2 subtype and
human bladder 5-hm ⬎  xxxd3398xxx , deob, oxybutynin ⬎
 xxxd1813xxx  ⬎ dpr-p-4(n¡o) ⬎ propiverine and for the m3
subtype and human parotid gland 5-hm, deob ⬎  xxxd1813xxx ,
 xxxd3398xxx  ⬎ oxybutynin ⬎ dpr-p-4(n¡o), propiverine. thus,
oxybutynin, deob, propiverine and  xxxd1813xxx , which bid to
the recombinant m3 subtype with the highest affinity among
the 5 subtypes, showed consistently 2 to 10 times higher affinity to muscarinic receptors in the parotid gland than in the
bladder, suggesting a significantly greater density of the m3
subtype than the other subtypes in the parotid gland.
it has been previously reported that  xxxd3398xxx  and
5-hm are nonselective to each muscarinic receptor subtype,
as shown by ki values of  xxxd3398xxx  (3.0 to 5.0 nm) and
5-hm (2.0 to 2.9 nm), and oxybutynin shows a relatively
higher affinity to the m3 subtype than to other subtypes.6,9

in the current study, in contrast to oxybutynin, propiverine,
their metabolites and  xxxd1813xxx , notably  xxxd3398xxx  and
5-hm, showed approximately 3 times higher affinity to the
m2 than to the m3 subtype as well as consistently greater
selectivity to muscarinic receptors in the bladder over the
parotid gland. taken together the current binding data with
 xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm, and the observation by the m3 subtype selective agents described, may indicate the existence
of a larger amount of pharmacologically relevant m2 subtype

than m3 subtype in the human bladder. similarly dpr-p4(n¡o) and propiverine showed approximately 2 times
higher affinity to the m3 than to the m2 subtype. interestingly although dpr-p-4(n¡o) had m3 subtype selectivity
similar to that of propiverine in human recombinant muscarinic receptors, compared with propiverine this metabolite
showed 3.4 times higher selectivity to receptors in the human bladder over those in the parotid gland. despite its
higher or equal affinity to the m3 subtype compared with the
m2 subtype the reason for the bladder selectivity of dpr-p4(n¡o) is not clear. consequently the current study may
support the pharmacological usefulness of  xxxd3398xxx  and
propiverine over oxybutynin as bladder selective agents.5,6
it is of some interest that antimuscarinic agents used for
the treatment of overactive bladder showed relatively high
affinity to the m1, m4 and/or m5 subtypes as well as to the
m2 and m3 subtypes (table 3). there are several suggestions
that m1, m4 and m5 subtypes exist in the bladder.2 we
should consider the significance of these data with caution
until their physiological and pathological roles are clarified.
in conclusion, compared with oxybutynin  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm
and dpr-p-4(n¡o) may bind more selectively to muscarinic
receptors in the human bladder than in the parotid gland.
