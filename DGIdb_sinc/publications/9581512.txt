abstract: the protein  xxxg2198xxx  (ptk) inhibitor piceatannol is also an inhibitor of the rat liver  xxxd1773xxx -dependent
protein kinase (pka) catalytic subunit (cak), rat brain ca2- and
phospholipid-dependent protein kinase c (pkc), avian gizzard
ca2tcalmodulindependent myosin light chain kinae ( xxxg1491xxx ),
and of wheat embryo ca2-dependent protein kinase (cdpk)
(ic50 values 3, 8,12, and 19 pm, respectively). however, a number of piceatannol-related compounds with fewer or no phenolic hydroxy substituents are inactive or very poor inhibitors of
these serinethreonine protein kinases. similarly, the ptk inhibitor  xxxd1979xxx  is a potent inhibitor of cak and of pkc (ic50
values 2 and 8 mm, respectively), whereas the non-phenolic perylene is ineffective as a protein kinase inhibitor.  xxxd1979xxx  is a
competitive inhibitor of both cak and of pkc but piceatannol
inhibits these enzymes in a fashion that is competitive and noncompetitive, respectively. interaction with calmodulin may contribute to the inhibition of  xxxg1491xxx  and cdpk by piceatannol.

drolysable tannins, acidic triterpenoids, isoquinoline alkaloids, and other natural products (1 —3). it is likely that
inhibition of signal transduction pathway components contributes to the biological effects of these compounds, noting that
many of these types of compounds are present in plants used

in traditional herbal medicine (4). membrane-bound or
soluble protein tyrosine kinases (ptks) have been shown to

be inhibited by a smaller set of bioactive plant natural
products including flavonoids such as quercetin and genistein
(5), the stilbene derivative piceatannol (6), and the gallic acid

dimer  xxxd1979xxx  (7). these compounds in turn have been
used as the basis for synthesis of more potent and selective
ptk inhibitors (7—10). plant derived ptk inhibitors have a
variety of biological effects. thus, the flavonoids quercetin
and genistein inhibit cell proliferation (4, 11, 12),  xxxd1979xxx 
has antihemorrhagic, antimutagenic, antitumor, and anticarcinogenic properties (7) and piceatannol is antileukemic (4,
10, 13). since ptk-initiated signaling is involved in regulation
of cell proliferation, it has been suggested that the anticancer
or selective growth inhibition effects of such ptk inhibitors

may be due in part to inhibition of such pathways (11).

however, such compounds are not necessarily highly specific
as inhibitors of ptk and can inhibit particular serine/threonine protein kinases. thus, genistein is a potent inhibitor of

1).

the inhibition of  xxxg1491xxx  by piceatannol could conceivably be
due to interaction with the enzyme, with the activating ca2calmodulin complex or a combination of both. the possible
interaction of piceatannol with calmodulin was investigated
by examining the effect of piceatannol on the fluorescence of
dansyl-calmodulin (dansyl-cam). the fluorescence of dansyl-

cam in the presence of ca2 (trace 1, fig.5) is greatly

enhanced over that observed in the absence of ca2 (trace 3,
fig. 5). in the presence of 10pm piceatannol there is a marked
decrease in the fluorescence of dansyl-calmodulin both in the
presence (trace 2, fig. 5) and absence of ca2 (trace 4, fig. 5).
this suggests that piceatannol can bind to dansyl-calmodulin
both in the presence and absence of ca2t

0.5 mm, evidently sufficient to overcome the competitive
inhibition by the piceatannol concentration employed (6).
the mode of inhibition of  xxxg1491xxx  and cdpk by piceatannol is

not clear since  xxxg1491xxx  is ca2-cam-dependent. cdpk has a
calmodulin-like activating domain (16) and piceatannol interacts with cam (fig. 5). any possible divalent cation chelating
by piceatannol is unlikely to have contributed to the observed
protein kinase inhibitions since the mg2 and ca2 concentra-

tions in the assays were much greater than the observed
piceatannol ic50 values. thus, the mg2 concentrations in the
pka, pkc, cdpk, and  xxxg1491xxx  assays were 8, 7, 8, and 0.8 mm,

respectively, as compared to the piceatannol ic50 values for

these protein kinases of 3, 8, 19, and 12pm, respectively
(table 1). similarly, the free ca2 concentrations in the assays
of the ca2-dependent protein kinases, namely pkc, cdpk,
and  xxxg1491xxx , were 0.5, 0.6 and 0.1 mm, respectively. while a
number of synthetic  xxxd1979xxx  derivatives are pkc inhibitors
(7) and a number of hydrolysable tannins with gallic acid- or
 xxxd1979xxx -related moieties are inhibitors of cak, pkc, and
cdpk (2),  xxxd1979xxx  has not been previously described as a
pkc inhibitor. the lack of inhibitory effectiveness of various
analogues of piceatannol and  xxxd1979xxx  shows that inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinases by these compounds
is critically dependent on the nature, number, and disposition
of phenolic hydroxy or other 0-containing substituents. given

the considerable conservation of the catalytic domain of
protein kinases (17), the present work widens the range of
potential high affinity in vivo targets of these protein tyrosine
kinase inhibitors.

discussion

piceatannol is an anticancer compound that is widely employed as a specific ptk inhibitor (10, 15). it is clearly
important to define the possible biochemical targets of such
bioactive compounds. the present work shows that picea-

tannol has a broad specificity and is a relatively potent
inhibitor of some serine/threonine-specific protein kinases
including pka catalytic subunit (cak), pkc, cdpk, and  xxxg1491xxx .

piceatannol evidently binds to the catalytic domain active site
of both ptk and pka. thus, it is competitive with respect to

the peptide substrate in inhibiting ptk (6) and competitive
with respect to both atp and peptide substrate in inhibiting
pka (fig.3). however, piceatannol is a non-competitive
inhibitor of pkc. piceatannol has previously been described as
not inhibiting pka when the protein kinase was assayed (as in

the present work) with the synthetic peptide kemptide

(lrraslg) as substrate (6). however, in the earlier study

kemptide was included at the very high concentration of
