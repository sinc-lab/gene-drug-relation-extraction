abstract
the expression of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) is a characteristic response to
inflammation and can be inhibited with  xxxd3219xxx .  xxxg2296xxx  plus ifn-g can
induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), ikk, ikb degradation and  xxxg1559xxx 
activation. the inhibition of the erk pathway with selective inhibitor, pd098059,
blocked cytokine-induced cox-2 expression and pge2 release. salicylate treatment
inhibited cox-2 expression induced by  xxxg2296xxx /ifn-g and regulated the activation of
erk, ikk and ikb degradation and subsequent  xxxg1559xxx  activation in mc3t3e1
osteoblasts. as well, antioxidant-catalase, n-acetyl-cysteine or reduced glutathioneattenuated cox-2 expression in combined cytokines-treated cells. these antioxidants

also inhibited the activation of erk, ikk and  xxxg1559xxx  in mc3t3e1 osteoblasts. in
addition,  xxxg2296xxx /ifn-g stimulated ros release in the osteoblasts. however salicylate
had no obvious effect on ros release in dcfda assay. the results showed that
salicylate inhibited the activation of erk and ikk, ikb degradation and  xxxg1559xxx 
activation independent of ros release and suggested that salicylate exerts its antiinflammatory action in part through inhibition of the erk, ikk, ikb,  xxxg1559xxx  and
resultant cox-2 expression pathway.

introduction
prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxane a2) are the metabolic products of the
membrane phospholipid  xxxd208xxx  via the cox pathway. presently, 2 forms of
cox enzyme are recognized: the constitutive enzyme cox-1, which is normally
expressed in most tissues; and cox-2, which is induced in many cell types in response
to various stimuli, including cytokine.[1]
a number of cytokines are expressed in osteoblasts. these cytokines exert their
actions directly on the osteoblast or modulate the expression and release of other
mediators, such as prostanoids. many inflammatory mediators use  xxxg1559xxx  as one of
their mechanisms of induction and perpetuation.[2,3] cox-2 is induced by inflammatory
cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx -a, which are produced in bone inflammation,
via the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx .[2]
the anti-inflammatory actions of aspirin and its metabolite,  xxxd3219xxx  have
been attributed in part to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via inhibition of
cyclooxygenase activity.[4]  xxxd3219xxx  and aspirin have been shown to inhibit
activation of nuclear factor-kb ( xxxg1559xxx ), which is elicited in response to inflammatory
agents such as lipopolysaccharide,  xxxg2296xxx -a and interleukin-1b.[5] the
inhibition was ascribed to the ability of salicylate to prevent phosphorylation and
subsequent degradation of the inhibitory protein  xxxg1561xxx ,[6,7] demonstrated that salicylate
specifically inhibits ikb kinase-b activity in vivo and in vitro. ikb kinase-b catalyzes
the transfer of phosphate moieties from atp to ikb, thereby allowing activation of
 xxxg1559xxx , and triggering expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses.
mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) play a role in mediating intracellular
signal transduction and regulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells in
response to a variety of extracellular stimuli.[8,9] in response to appropriate stimuli,
mapks are activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues.[10] erk
has been classically associated with growth- and differentiation-inducing signals.
studies have suggested that the cox gene is regulated at multiple levels: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational. however, the role of mapks cascades in the control of cox expression has not been completely defined.
in this study, we investigated whether the mapk signaling pathway is involved in
the regulation of cox and pge2 expression and whether salicylate influences mapk
activity in osteoblasts. we show that  xxxd3219xxx  inhibits  xxxg1361xxx -dependent
induction of  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity and  xxxg1559xxx -mediated cox gene expression.

northern blot analysis
total rna was isolated using ultraspec rna isolation kit (amersham). northern
blot analysis was conducted as described by chae et al.[11] briefly, 20 mg of rna was
subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. the gel was then
transferred by capillary action onto a nylon membrane (zeta probe, biorad, laboratories, melville, ny). the membrane was hybridized with [32p]dctp-labeled cox-2
cdna (a kind gift from dr. paul worley, johns hopkins university) and  xxxg861xxx .
after hybridization, the blot was exposed to kodak x-ray film (kodak, rochester, ny)
for 24 – 48 h with intensifying screens at 70°c. quantitation of the intensity of the
cox-2/ xxxg861xxx  bands was performed using a densitometer (molecular dynamics).
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa)
the nucleus from various agents-treated mc3t3e1 cells was extracted according
to modification of the procedure described by dignam et al.[12] the cells were washed
twice with ice-cold pbs and lysed with hypotonic buffer (10 mm hepes, ph 7.9,
1.5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm kcl, 0.2 mm pmsf, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml
aprotinin, 20 mm pepstatin a, 100 mm leupeptin). after centrifugation at 1000  g, the
nuclear pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm hepes, ph 7.9, 25 %(v/
v) glycerol, 0.4 m kcl, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm edta, 0.2 mm pmsf, and 0.5 mm
dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 10 min. the nuclear proteins in the supernatant
were recovered after centrifugation at 15,000  g, quantified by using a bca protein
assay kit (sigma co., saint louis, mo) and used to carry out emsa. to measure the
activation of transcription factors including  xxxg1559xxx , the oligonucleotide probes of nfkb containing the igg chain binding site ( xxxg1559xxx : 5’-ccg gtt aac aga ggg ggc
ttt ccg ag-3’) were used. two complementary strands of the oligonucleotides were
annealed and labeled with [a-32p]-dctp using random primer labeling kit (rediprime,
amersham life science, england). nuclear extracts (5 mg) were reacted with 2– 5 ng
of the radiolabelled  xxxg1559xxx  or ap-1 probes (50,000– 100,000 cpm/ng). the reaction
was performed in the presence of 10 mm tris – hcl (ph 7.5), 100 mm nacl, 1 mm
dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol (final volume: 25 ml) at room temperature for 30 min. the

immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 200 ml of lysates with 2 mg of
anti- xxxg1159xxx  antibody (santa cruz biotechnology) for 1 hr, and then adding 20 ml of
protein a-agarose. after incubation for 1 hr at 4°c with end-over-end mixing, the
immunocomplex was recovered by centrifugation and washed with washing buffer (20
mm tris –hcl, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 5 mm egta, 2 mm dtt, and 1 mm pmsf)
twice. kinase activity was assayed for 20 min at 37°c in the presence of 2 mg substrate
(gst- xxxg1561xxx ), 30 mm atp, and 20 mci [g-32p]-atp in 55 ml assay buffer (20 mm tris –
hcl, ph 7.5, and 20 mm mgcl2). and then, the proteins were resolved by sds-page,
and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. the relative activity of ikk
was quantified by measuring the radioactivity of phosphorus-32 incorporate into gstikba. a phosphorimager (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca, u.s.a.) was used to
quantify band intensity.

 xxxg2296xxx 
a and ifn- ; stimulate cox-2 expression
and pge 2 release in osteoblasts
murine mc3t3e1 cells were chosen to investigate the effect of inflammatory
cytokines on cyclooxygenase (cox), especially cox-2 expression, as they were
established from newborn mouse calvaria and differentiate into osteoblasts, showing
calcification in vitro similar to primary osteoblasts. when mc3t3e1 cells were
incubated with  xxxg2296xxx  (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of ifn-g (100 u/ml) for
24 hr, the combined cytokines ( xxxg2296xxx /ifn-g) led to significant increase in cox-2
protein in mc3t3e1 cells (fig. 1a). ifn-g had no apparent effects, by itself, whereas  xxxg2296xxx  stimulated expression of cox-2. however,  xxxg2296xxx  (10 ng/ml) in the
presence of ifn-g (100 u/ml) had a synergistic effect in terms of inducing cox-2
expression in mc3t3e1 cells. cox-1 levels were not affected by treatment with
 xxxg2296xxx  (10 ng/ml) and ifn-g (100 u/ml). to elucidate the molecular basis for
 xxxd3219xxx -mediated cox-2 inhibition, cells were first treated with  xxxg2296xxx 
(10 ng/ml) and ifn-g (100 u/ml). a dose-dependent decrease in  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-ginduced cox-2 protein expression was observed in cells treated with salicylate (fig. 1b).
the decrease in salicylate-mediated cox-2 protein levels resulted in reduced pge2
release (fig. 1c).

erk activation in mc3t3e1 osteoblasts. as shown in fig. 2a, the combination of
these two cytokines induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx  and 2,
which increased within 10 minutes and then decreased to baseline after 30 minutes. to
demonstrate that the observed erk phosphorylation correlates with changes in kinase
activity, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with  xxxg1369xxx  antibody and in vitro kinase
assays were performed using mbp as a substrate. a significant increase in  xxxg1369xxx 
kinase activity was noted  xxxd1891xxx  min of treatment, in parallel with erk phosphorylation. treatment of mc3t3e1 cells with salicylate (10 mm) in the presence of  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g attenuated the erk 1 and 2 phosphorylation and reduced  xxxg1369xxx  kinase
activity (fig. 2a and b). next, to address the role of  xxxg1361xxx  in the cytokine-mediated
induction of cox-2, mc3t3e1 cells were treated with the  xxxg1361xxx -specific inhibitor
pd090859 reduced the levels of erk and erk kinase activity in  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-gtreated cells.

in the presence or absence of salicylate (10 mm) or pd098059 (25 mm). (a). the proteins were
then subjected to immunoblot analysis, using antibodies specific for the active (phosphorylated)

endogenous erk map kinase activity was examined by immunocomplex assays as described in
materials and methods. these are typical results from four independent experiments.

pd098059, a specific  xxxg1361xxx  inhibitor also has a regulatory

in mc3t3e1 osteoblasts
to examine the effect of pd098059, a specific  xxxg1361xxx  inhibitor, on  xxxg2296xxx  and
ifn-g-induced cox-2 expression, mc3t3e1 cells were treated with  xxxg2296xxx  (10 ng/ml)
and ifn-g (100 u/ml) in the presence or absence of pd098059 (0, 6.25, 12.5 or 25 mm).
a dose-dependent decrease in cytokine-mediated cox-2 protein expression was
induced by the  xxxg1361xxx  inhibitor treatment (fig. 3a). next, to verify whether the
decrease in cytokines-induced cox-2 protein levels by pd098059 resulted in decreased
pge2 release, pge2 levels were measured. as expected, pd098059 dramatically
inhibited pge2 release in  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g-treated mc3t3e1 cells (fig. 3b). this
result suggests a role for erk signaling pathway in the regulation of cox-2 expression
by ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx  in mc3t3e1 osteoblasts, consistent with reports in other types
of cells.[13]

incubation of mc3t3e1 cells with  xxxg2296xxx  plus ifn-g generated prominent  xxxg1559xxx 
complex binding. in cells treated with salicylate, the nuclear level of  xxxg1559xxx  dnabinding activity was significantly reduced. immunoblot analysis of ikb proteins in the
cytosol of mc3t3e1 cells indicated that the salicylate-induced inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx 
activation was associated with suppression of ikb degradation (fig. 4b). stimulation of
cells with  xxxg2296xxx  plus ifn-g induced significant degradation of  xxxg1561xxx  and ikbb within
30 min. however, addition of salicylate blocked the degradation of both ikb proteins,
suggesting that salicylate inhibits an intermediate step in the signal pathway toward

transcription factors via the activation of map kinase signaling pathways.[17] since
induction of cox-2 gene in  xxxg2296xxx /ifn-g-exposed osteoblasts was suppresed by h2o2
scavengers, we tested the effect of antioxidants on the cytokines-induced erk, ikk,
 xxxg1561xxx , ikbb and  xxxg1559xxx  activation. first, nuclear factor-kb-dna-binding activity was
measured by emsa (fig. 7a). in cells treated with antioxidants, the nuclear level of
 xxxg1559xxx  was significantly reduced. in addition, immunoblot analysis of ikb proteins in
the cytosol of mc3t3e1 cells indicated that antioxidants-mediated inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx 
activation was associated with suppression of ikb degradation (fig. 7b). degradation
of ikb proteins was shown to occur after signal-induced phosphorylation of ikb
proteins at specific serine residues by ikk. to determine whether the antioxidants
inhibit signal pathway leading to ikb phosphorylation, we measured ikk activity in
 xxxg2296xxx /ifn-g-stimulated mc3t3e1 cells. when we measured induction of ikk activity
in cells treated with catalase, nac or gsh, but not by superoxide dismutase (sod) or
tempo, superoxide scavenger (fig. 7c, and data not shown). the inhibitory effect of
the antioxidants appeared at the same concentrations of which inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation.

subsequent  xxxg1559xxx  activation, in mc3t3e1 osteoblasts.

reactive oxygen species (ros) produced in osteoblasts were determined by
measuring fluorescence after loading with dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (dcf-da), a
dye that is oxidized into a highly fluorescent form in the presence of peroxides. dcfda can be oxidized by any peroxidase and hydroperoxide including h2o2. we
examined whether salicylate prevented the oxidation of dcf. mc3t3e1 cells were
exposed to  xxxg2296xxx  plus ifn-g in the absence or presence of salicylate (10 mm).
pretreatment of salicylate did not have any effect on dcf oxidation. however, ros
generation was markedly reduced in cytokined stimulated cells exposed to salicylate.

salicylate and cox-2 expression

these data indicate that when the mc3t3e1 osteoblasts are exposed to  xxxg2296xxx  plus
ifn-g, free oxygen radicals are generated, led to erk and ikk activation, ikb
degradation,  xxxg1559xxx  activation and resulted in cox-2 expression in osteoblasts.
however, our data suggest that the signaling transduction of salicylate does not include
ros inhibition in mc3t3e1 osteoblasts.

discussion
the factors that may regulate bone metabolism during inflammation are of
considerable importance in understanding the pathogenesis of a number of common
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and the
periodontal diseases. the effects of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (il-1), tumor
necrosis factor-a ( xxxg2296xxx ), and the interferon-g (ifn-g) on bone cells have been studied
extensively in the past and have complex effects on bone metabolism.[18]  xxxg2296xxx 
stimulates bone resorption and can inhibit markers of osteoblast activity such as alkaline phosphatase and collagen synthesis.[15] ifn-g can directly inhibit cell proliferation
and alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblast cultures.[16]
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2), also known as prostaglandin h synthase, catalyzes the
rate-limiting steps in formation of prostaglandin endoperoxides.[1] two distinct
cyclooxygenases have been identified, encoded by separate genes. cox-1 is expressed
constitutively in many tissues.[17] in contrast, the more recently identified cox-2 gene
is expressed at a very low basal level in most tissues, but is rapidly and transiently
induced by a wide variety of mitogens, hormones and other ligands.[18]
an osteogenic mc3t3e1 cell line was established from newborn mouse calvaria.
the cells differentiate into osteoblasts, and show calcification in vitro.[13]  xxxg1884xxx  induction has been demonstrated with the mc3t3e1 cells by prostaglandins.[19,20] it was also reported previously that  xxxg2296xxx  increased the pge2
production and the cyclooxygenase activity in mouse osteoblastic cell line
mc3t3e1.[21 – 23] ifn-g is a proinflammatory cytokine that is principally produced
by activated t-lymphocytes and natural killer cells and affects a vast array of different
cellular processes.[21,22,24]
since the addition of  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g brought about such a typical and prominent
induction of  xxxg1884xxx  in mc3t3e1 cells, we attempted to elucidate the
transcriptional regulation of the  xxxg1884xxx  gene in this system.
a requirement for  xxxg1559xxx  activity in cox-2 induction has been suggested in many
cell lines.[2,23] many studies implicating  xxxg1559xxx  activation in cox-2 induction involve
use of chemical inhibitors[22] and peptide inhibitors,[25] which may have an effect on
 xxxg1559xxx  activity at another site on the cox-2 promoter.
to investigate whether  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk mediated the induction of cox-2 by  xxxg2296xxx , pd098059, a specific inhibitor of mapk kinase, was used to block activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk. treatment of mc3t3e1 cells with 20 mm pd098059 decreased  xxxg2296xxx -mediated phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk. cox-2 expression has been linked
with activation of mapk pathways.[26 – 28] in the present study, we demonstrated that
salicylate inhibited cox-2 by activating  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk.  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk activation
can regulate the expression of numerous genes by activating  xxxg1559xxx .[29] our data
suggest that  xxxg1559xxx  is important for mediating the induction of cox-2 by  xxxg2296xxx .

chae et al.

it has been shown that  xxxd3219xxx  inhibits  xxxg1559xxx  activation by preventing
the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of  xxxg1561xxx .[5,30] salicylate inhibits  xxxg1561xxx 
phosphorylation and degradation induced by  xxxg2296xxx  but not by il-1.[31,32] the ability
of salicylate to inhibit  xxxg2296xxx -induced cox-2 is dependent upon inhibition of tnf-ainduced  xxxg1559xxx  activation.
the data reported here suggest that salicylate inhibited cox-2 expression induced
by cytokines in part through the suppression of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk signaling pathway.
 xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g increased the phosphorylation of erk and cox-2 expression. the
inhibitor of  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk (pd098059) suppressed cox-2 protein and  xxxg1559xxx  binding
activity induced by cytokines. salicylate inhibited the phosphorylation of erk. we
further showed that the pretreatment of cells with salicylate blocked the phosphorylation of erk induced by  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g. taken together, these data suggest that at
least some of the anti-inflammatory effects of salicylate may be due to the inhibition
of erk.
it has been proposed that salicylate exerts a global inhibitory effect an  xxxg2296xxx 
signaling by acting at a  xxxg2296xxx  receptor proximal site.[6] the results provide a possible
mechanism to explain the potential anti-inflammatory effects of salicylate and suggest
that erk activation by cytokines may be involved in the subsequent induction of cox2 expression.
salicylate prevents the  xxxg2296xxx -induced degradation of the  xxxg1559xxx  receptor,  xxxg1561xxx ,
in some epithelial cell lines.[33] because  xxxg1561xxx  degradation is necessary for  xxxg1559xxx 
translocation to the nucleus, this correlates with decreased activation of the
transcription factor. inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  by salicylate has also been reported in
lymphocytes.[5]
vietor et al.[34] reported that  xxxg2296xxx  activated p42/ xxxd1355xxx  mapk in normal human
fibroblasts. the object of this study was to further characterize the activation of p42/ xxxd1355xxx 
mapk and cox-2 by  xxxg2296xxx . it is possible that this newly demonstrated inhibition of
cytokine signaling contributes to the anti-inflammatory action of salicylate.
