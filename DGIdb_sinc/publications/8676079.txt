summary
interleukin (il)-11 is a multifunctional cytokine whose role in osteoclast development has not
been fully elucidated. w e examined  xxxg1162xxx  production by primary osteoblasts and the effects of
rat monoclonal anti-mouse glycoprotein 130 (gp130) antibody on osteoclast formation, using a
coculture of mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. il-1, tnfol, pge2,  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) and 1cl,25- xxxd408xxx  (leq25(oh)2d3) similarly induced production
of  xxxg1162xxx  by osteoblasts, but il-6, il-4, and tgf[3 did not. primary osteoblasts constitutively
expressed m r n a s for both  xxxg1162xxx  receptor (il-11ro0 and gp130. osteotropic factors did not
modulate il-11ro~ m r n a at 24 h, but steady-state gp130 m r n a expression in osteoblasts
was upregulated by 1ot,25(oh)2d 3, pth, or il-1. in cocultures, the formation ofmultinucleated osteoclast-like cells (ocls) in response to  xxxg1162xxx , or il-6 together with its soluble il-6 receptor was dose-dependently inhibited by rat monoclonal anti-mouse gp130 antibody. furthermore, adding anti-gp130 antibody abolished o c l formation induced by il-1, and partially
inhibited o c l formation induced by pge2, pth, or 1ol,25(oh)2d3. during osteoclast formation in marrow cultures, a sequential relationship existed between the expression of  xxxg321xxx  m r n a and il-11ro~ m r n a . osteoblasts as well as ocls expressed transcripts
for il-11rc~, as indicated by r t - p c r analysis and in situ hybridization. these results suggest
a central role of gp130-coupled cytokines, especially  xxxg1162xxx , in osteoclast development. since
osteoblasts and mature osteoclasts expressed il-11rct m r n a , both bone-forming and boneresorbing cells are potential targets of  xxxg1162xxx .

nterleukin (il)-11 is a functionally pleiotropic cytokine

i that was isolated from a bone marrow-derived stromal
cell line based on its ability to stimulate the proliferation of
il-6-dependent cells (1). an indication that  xxxg1162xxx  might
regulate connective tissue responses was given by its expression in relatively restricted cells of the mesenchymal lineage, such as lung fibroblasts, bone marrow stromal cells,
placental stromal cells, articular chondrocytes, and synoviocytes (1-4).

the  xxxg1162xxx  receptor is a cell surface receptor that consists
of two components: a unique ligand-binding 150-kd glycoprotein chain (il-11ro0 (5, 6) and a non-ligand binding, signal transducing 130-kd glycoprotein chain (gp130p
(7, 8). both components are necessary for high affinity
binding and signal transduction (6, 8). signaling occurs after ligand-induced dimerization ofgpl30 that activates down1abbreviations used in this paper: 10l,25(oh)zd3,lot,25-dihydroxyvitamin

stream molecules. these include members o f the jak family o f non-receptor kinases and a latent transcription factor,
acute phase response factor or signal transducer and activator o f transcription factor 3 ( a p r f / s t a t 3) (9, 10). the
gp130 signal transducer mediates biological effects exerted
not only by  xxxg1162xxx , but also il-6,  xxxg1637xxx  (osm),  xxxg1327xxx  (lif), ciliary  xxxg1614xxx 
(cntf), and cardiotrophin-1 (ct-1) (11, 12).
several lines o f evidence suggest that  xxxg1162xxx  is an important osteotropic factor.  xxxg1162xxx  receptor transcripts are present
in chondroblastic and osteoblastic progenitor cells during
mouse embryogenesis (13).  xxxg1162xxx  itself is produced by human osteosarcoma saos-2 cells (14), and girasole et al. (15)
showed that  xxxg1162xxx  dose-dependently stimulated osteoclastlike multinucleated cell (ocl) formation in cocultures o f
mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. they reported
that monoclonal anti- xxxg1162xxx  antibody inhibited osteoclast formation induced by several osteotropic factors. w e also reported that  xxxg1162xxx , il-6 together with its soluble il-6 receptor (sll-6rcl), o s m and lif similarly triggered o c l
formation in cocultures (16, 17).
these observations focus interest on the modulation o f
 xxxg1162xxx  and its receptor during o c l development. in the
present study, we measured  xxxg1162xxx  production by primary
mouse calvarial cell cultures using a novel bioassay based on
the expression o f functional  xxxg1162xxx  receptors in ba/f3 cells
(6). w e examined the effects o f il-1, t n f a , pge 2,  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) and lci,25- xxxd408xxx 
[1ci,25(oh)zd3], all o f which induce o c l formation in
mouse cocultures. the role o f gp130-mediated signals in
o c l formation was determined using a rat monoclonal antimouse gp130 antibody. the expression o f gp130 and il11r0~ m r n a was studied by northern analysis and reverse transcription-pcr, respectively. the distribution o f
il-111kci transcripts was investigated by in situ hybridization.
w e found that osteotropic factors induced  xxxg1162xxx  production by osteoblasts and in addition, modulated steady-state
levels o f osteoblast gp130 m r n a .  xxxg1182xxx 
transcripts were detected in osteoblasts and osteoclast-like
cells. in the present study we demonstrate that gp130-mediated signals are critical cofactors for osteoclastogenesis induced by a variety o f bone resorbing factors.

materials and m e t h o d s
animals and cytokines. newborn and 6-9-wk-old male c57/
b16j mice were purchased from monash university animal services center (clayton, australia). recombinant human  xxxg1162xxx  (specific activity 10s u/rag protein) was obtained from dr. t. willson
(walter and eliza hall institute, melbourne, australia). neutralizing monoclonal murine anti-human  xxxg1162xxx  antibody was generously provided by genetics institute (cambridge, ma). recombinant mll-11, mll-6, hosm, mll-3, rail-4, hlif, mll-lo~,
and mtnfei were purchased from peprotech (rocky hill, nj).
mouse sll-6r was prepared from cho cells as described (16). recombinant htgf[31 was the gift of genentech inc. (san francisco, ca). kx,25(oh)2d3 was obtained from wako pure chemical
2582

co. (osaka, japan). bacterial collagenase was obtained from worthington biochemical co. (freefold, australia). other chemicals and
reagents were of analytical grade.
cell culture and determinationof osteoclast characteristics. to isolate osteoblastic cells, 6--10 calvaria obtained from 1-d-old mice were
cut into small pieces in 10-cm culture dishes with 5 ml of ci-mem
(gibco brl, gaithersburg, md) containing 30% fbs (cytosystems, castle hill, nsw, australia). type-i collagen gel solution
(70%, 5 ml) (cellmatrix type i-a; nitta gelatin co., osaka, japan) was added in the culture dish according to the manufacturers' instructions. after culture for 4-6 d, osteoblastic cells grown
from the calvaria were collected by treating with pbs containing
0.3% collagenase for 20 min at 37~ (17). these freshly isolated
osteoblastic cells were cocultured with bone marrow cells as described (16, 17). in short, primary osteoblastic cells (104 per well)
and nucleated marrow cells (2 • 105 per well) were cocultured in
48-well plates (coming glass ins., coming, ny) with 0.3 ml of
ci-mem containing 10% fbs in the presence of test chemicals.
cultures were incubated in quadruplicate and cells were replenished
on day 4 with flesh medium. ocl formation was evaluated after
culturing for 6 d. for  xxxg45xxx  (trap)
staining, adherent cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in pbs
for 3 min. after treatment with  xxxd102xxx acetone (50/50, vol/vol)
for 1 rain, the well surface was air dried and incubated for 10 min
at room temperature in an acetate buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate,
ph 5.0) containing 0.01% napthol as-mx phosphate (sigma
chem. co., st. louis, mo) as a substrate and 0.03% red violet
lb salt (sigma) as a stain for the reaction product in the presence
of 50 mm sodium tartrate. trap positive cells appeared as dark
 xxxd187xxx . the expression of calcitonin receptors (ctp,) was assessed by autoradiography using [12si]- xxxd407xxx  as described (16-20).
mouse bone marrow cell cultures were prepared as described
(18, 20). the marrow cells were plated at 1 • 106 cells/ml and incubated in c~-mem containing 12.5% fbs in 9-cm petri dishes
(nunc, inc. naperville, il). ocl formation was induced by lo~,25
(oh)2d 3 (10 nm), added on the first day and every third day thereafter, when half the medium was replaced with fresh medium. in
parallel cultures, the cells were cultured on top of 13-ram thermanox coverslips (nunc) for enumeration of ocls by trapstaining and [~2si]-calcitonin binding.
for in situ hybridization, after coculturing on collagen gels for
7 d (19), cells were treated with collagenase (0.2%), and subcultured on top of 13-mm diameter thermanox coverslips (nunc)
in 24-well plates, before processing.
a stock of the mouse bone marrow-derived stromal cell line
st2 (21, 22), was obtained from riken cell bank (tsukuba, japan). st2 cells in the 12th passage were grown to sub-confluence in
75-cm 2 tissue culture flasks (nunc), in phenol red-flee ot-mem
containing 10% fbs. the medium was changed to 2% fbs overnight, and cells were treated with osteotropic factors before extraction of total r n a at the appropriate times.
biological assay for il- 1i.  xxxg1162xxx  activity was measured using
the ba/f3 cell microproliferation assay (6, 23). survival and proliferation of ba/f3 cells are supported by  xxxg1177xxx , and also by  xxxg1162xxx 
after transfection with cdnas for mll-111kcx and gp130. transfected cells also respond to high concentrations of the complex of
mll-6 and sll61kot (3 p,g/ml il-6 and 500 ng/ml sll-6rot, respectively), but do not proliferate in response to osm, il-6, or
lif (6). the cells did not show effects with other cytokines or reagents used in the present study. ba/f3 clones were grown in
dme containing 10% (vol/vol) fbs and 10% (vol/vol) wehi3b d-conditioned medium as a source of  xxxg1177xxx  (24). cells were

 xxxg1162xxx  and gpl30 signals in osteoclastogenesis

maintained by twice weekly passage and used in exponential
growth phase. cell proliferation was measured in lux-60 microwell hl-a plates (nunc). for use, ba/f3 cells were washed
three times in dme containing 20% (vol/vol) fbs and resuspended at a concentration of 20,000 cells/ml in the same medium. 10-~1 aliquots of cell suspension were then placed in the
culture wells with 5 i.u of serial dilutions of recombinant  xxxg1177xxx ,
 xxxg1162xxx , or culture supematants. after 2 d of incubation at 37~ in
a fully humidified incubator containing 10% co 2 in air, viable
cells were counted using an inverted microscope.  xxxg1162xxx  concentrations in the supernatants were determined from a standard
curve set up with known amounts of recombinant  xxxg1162xxx . the
detection limit of this assay was typically 50-100 pg/ml (fig. 1).
elisafor sll6ra. concentrations of sll-6ret were determined by a sandwich elisa using rat monoclonal anti-mll-6ra
antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-mll-6ra antibody, as described (25). the detection limit of this assay was 1 ng/ml.
northern analysis. total cellular r n a was extracted using the
guanidine thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (26), fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels (20 ixg/
lane), and transferred to nylon membranes (hybond-n; amersham corp., arlington heights, il). a 2.7-kb mouse gp130 cdna
(27) was random prime labeled with [32p]dctp to a specific activity
of i • 109 u/min/mg dna (boehringer mannheim, mannheim
gmbh, germany). hybridization and washing were carried out
as previously described (28). specifically bound cdna was quantified using a phosphorlmager and imagequant software (molecular dynamics, sunnydale, ca). relative m r n a levels were normalized for loading variability by comparison with 18s ribosomal
r n a levels in the same membranes, probed with a 32p-labeled
18s ribosomal r n a oligonucleotide.
pcr amplification of reverse-transcribed mrna. expression of
il-11r~x, il-6ret, and  xxxg321xxx  (ctr) m r n a reverse-transcribed from primary osteoblasts or bone marrow cell
cultures were determined by pcr and southern blot analysis. first
strand cdna was synthesized from 2.5 i-~gof total r n a by incubation for 1 h at 42~ with 12 u of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (promega corp., madison, wi) after random
hexanucleotide priming. the reaction mixture (25 ixl) was made
up to 100 ixl with sterile distilled water, and 10 i~1 (1/10) were submitred for p c r to amplify the sequences of the mouse  xxxg1163xxx ,
il-6rcx, ctr, and  xxxg861xxx  mrnas specified below. the reaction mixture contained 50 pmol of each primer, 0.25 mm  xxxd1148xxx ,
 xxxd1837xxx , dctp, and dttp (pharmacia, uppsala, sweden), 2 i~1
10• reaction buffer, 1 u of taq dna polymerase (boehringer
mannheim) and sterile distilled water, and was overlaid with 50 ~1
of paraffin oil. p c r for ctr, il-11rcx, and il-6rcx was performed in a dna thermal cycler 480 (perkin-elmer cetus instrs., norwalk, ct) as described (17). to permit semiquantitation
of the p c r products, preliminary experiments were performed
to ensure that the number of pcr cycles employed for each product in a given experiment (described in the legends to figs. 5 and
9) was within the exponential phase of the amplification curve.
pcr products were resolved on a 2% wt/vol agarose gel and the
specificity of the reaction was confirmed by southern transfer
onto nylon membranes (hybond-n; amersham) and hybridization with 32p-labeled intemal oligonucleotide probes.
control pcr reactions were carried out on non-reverse transcribed rna; in none of these samples were p c r products detected.
oligonucleotides were synthesized on an applied biosystems
dna synthesizer model 381a (foster city, ca). the oligonucleotides for mouse il-6ro~ (17) were: 5 ' - c c t g t g t g g g g t 2583

romas et al.

tccagaggat-3' (3' primer complementary to nucleotides 9801001) and 5'-ctgccagtattctcagcagctg-3' (5' primer
complementary to nucleotides 488-519). the products were verified by southern hybridization with the internal oligonucleotide,
5'-cacaacgaagcgtttcacagctt-3'. the oligonucleotides for mouse  xxxg1163xxx  (6, 17) were: 5 ' - g g a g g c c t c c a gagggt-3' (3' primer complementary to nucleotides 661-667)
and 5 ' - g g g t c c t c c a g g g g t c c a g t a t g g - 3 ' (5' primer
complementary to nucleotides 133-156). the products were verified
by southern hybridization with the internal oligonucleotide,
5'-ctcctgtacttggagtccagg-3'. the oligonucleotides
for mouse c t r were: 5'-acaaactgga(t/c)(t/g)cccagcaggggcac-3' (3' primer complementary to nucleotides
1663-1689) and 5'-aagaacatgtt(c/t)ct(c/g/t)actta (5' primer complementary to nucleotides 1058--1079), as
we previously reported (20). the c t r p c r products were verified with the internal sense strand oligonucleotide, 5' -accaagatgaggcaaacc-3', by southern hybridization.
to ensure equal starting quantities of cdna for the experiments,
and to allow semiquantitation of the p c r products representing
mll11-ra or mll-6ra, the reverse-transcribed r n a samples
were also amplified using oligonucleotide primers specific for
 xxxg861xxx  (29). a fragment of--420 bp was amplified using 5'-specific oligonucleotide, (5'-catggagaaggctggggctc-3',
representing nucleotides 306-325 of rat  xxxg861xxx ) and 3'-specific
oligonucleotide, (5'-aacggatacattgggggtag-3', representing nucleotides 701-720). products were verified with [32p]_
labeled internal oligonucleotide (5'-gctgtgggcaaggtcatccc-3', representing nucleotides 640-659). the signals were
quantitated using a phosphorlmager and imagequant software
(molecular dynamics).
preparation of anti-mouse gp-130 antibody. wistar rats were immunized with 100 i~g of soluble mouse gp130 in freund's complete adjuvant, followed by seven 50-1xg boosts of soluble mouse
gp130 in freund's incomplete adjuvant once a week. 3 d after the
last boost, the rats were sacrificed and spleen cells were fused with
p3u1 mouse myeloma cells with  xxxd2982xxx  1500 (boehringer mannheim). hybridomas were established by conventional
hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection methods, and hybridomas producing anti-mouse gp130 were selected by flow cytometry using baf- xxxg374xxx  cells, which were established by transfection of baf-b03 cells with mouse gp130 cdna (27).
briefly, culture supernatants of the hybridomas (100 i~1) were
added to baf- xxxg374xxx  cells (5 x 10s cells) with 100 ixl of ca 2+,
mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% heat-inactivated fbs and 0.1% sodium azide. the cells were incubated for
20 min on ice, and then incubated for 20 min with fitc-conjugated mouse anti-rat igg (2 i~g/ml) on ice. stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using facscan| (becton dickinson
immunocytometry sys., mountain view, ca). hybridomas recognizing soluble mouse gp130 were cloned twice by limiting dilution. established hybridomas were expanded as ascite tumors in
balb/c nude mice, and the antibody was purified from the
fluid with protein g-agarose column (oncogene science, inc.,
manhasset, ny).
synthesis of riboprobe. a riboprobe for mouse  xxxg1163xxx  was
synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin (dig) by using a r n a
labeling kit (boehringer mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. a 1350-bp p c r fragment in the bstxi site of
the mammalian expression vector pef-bos (6) was subcloned
into the xbai site of pbluescript (stratagene, inc., la jolla, ca).
the antisense and sense probes were then obtained after linearization of the plasmid with sinai for t3 and noti for t7 r n a poly-

merase transcription, respectively. the specificity of the ckna
probe for its target sequence was verified by northern analysis of
total r n a derived from transfected ba/f3 cells.
in situ hybridization. in situ hybridization was performed as
described with minor modifications (30). cocultures established
on top of 13-mm coverslips in 24-well plates were rinsed in icecold pbs, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa) in pbs for 30
rain. after washing in pbs, they were pretreated with 0.2 m hc1
for 20 min, washed with sterile distilled water for 10 min, and digested with 5 p,g/ml proteinase k (37~ 30 rain) in pbs. after
treatment with 2 mg/ml of glycine in pbs to inactivate proteinase k, they were refixed with 4% pfa-pbs for 15 rain. hybridization was carried out with 2-4 ng/p~l of antisense crna in a
damp chamber in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5•
ssc, 2% blocking reagent (boehringer mannheim), 0.02% sodium  xxxd3215xxx , and 0.1% n-lauroylsarcosyl, for 18 h at
42~ after hybridization, coverslips were washed sequentially
with 2• ssc for 30 rain, treated with 20 ~g/ml ribonuclease
(rnase, dnase free; boehringer mannheim) in 2• ssc for 30
rain to remove excess crna, then washed with 1• ssc for 30
min, and finally with 0.1 • ssc for 30 rain. detection of hybridized probe was with the anti-dig-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. the coverslips
were rehydrated in ethanol, and counterstained with nuclear fast
red before mounting.
cytospin preparations oftransfected ba/f3 cells served as positive controls. hybridization specificity was verified by elimination
of signals after pretreatment with 100 ~g/ml of rnase for 1 h before hybridization with antisense riboprobe.
statisticalanalysis. statistical significance was determined by student's t test.

regulation of  xxxg1162xxx  production by primary murine osteoblasts. w e first analyzed  xxxg1162xxx  production by primary osteoblasts derived from mouse calvaria. subconfluent osteoblasts were incubated in ot-mem containing 10% fbs in
the presence or absence o f osteotropic factors, and  xxxg1162xxx 
activity in the culture supernatants was quantitated using
the ba/f3 bioassay. fig. 1 shows the effect o f graded concentrations ofrhll-11 on the viability oftransfected ba/f3
cells expressing the rail-11rot chain and gp130 (le~), and
the neutralization o f this response by monoclonal murine
anti-human  xxxg1162xxx  antibody (otll-11 mab, right). parental
ba/f3 cells did not respond to rhll-11, whereas both parental and transfected cells proliferated in response to rmll-3
(data not shown). the specificity of this microassay depended
on the parallel response o f transfected and parental cells.
using this assay, it was clear that unstimulated osteoblasts
produced levels ofll-11 that were below the limits o f detection in our assays. in contrast, cells that were stimulated with
rail-lot, mtnfot, pge2, p t h , and 10t,25(oh)2d 3 produced readily detectable levels o f  xxxg1162xxx . as seen in fig. 2,
the time-dependent effects o f il-1, tnfot, or pge 2 were
appreciated only after incubation for 6 h, and were nearmaximal after 12-h incubation. the levels o f  xxxg1162xxx  present
after p t h or lot,25(oh)2d3 stimulation were not maximal
before 24 h.

figure 1. left panel shows a microassay for ba/f3 cell proliferation.
transfected ba/f3 cells expressing the mll-111~t chain and gp130 were
incubated at 200 cells per well in a volume of 15 p~l with the indicated
amounts ofrhll-11. after incubation for 48 h the numbers of viable cells
were counted. in parallel incubations, parental ba/f3 cells were non-viable (not shown). right panel shows the effect of graded concentrations of

responses. the effects o f il-1 or t n f were evident with
concentrations as low as 0.1 n g / m l (the lowest concentration tested). doses as low as 10 pm 1ot,25(oh)2d3 and 25
ng/ml o f h p t h (1-34) induced  xxxg1162xxx . importantly, the ability to induce  xxxg1162xxx  release from osteoblasts was not a general property o f all osteotropic cytokines, since rail-6 (20
ng/ml), h o s m (20 ng/ml), htgf]3 (1 ng/ml), or rail-4
(10 ng/ml) did not elicit  xxxg1162xxx  release (fig. 3). the effects
o f l l - 1 and tnfot on  xxxg1162xxx  production were abolished by
incubating with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin
(10 -6 m), but the effects o f pge 2, p t h , or 1ot,25(oh)2d3
were not (data not shown). thus, prostaglandins seemed to
be involved in  xxxg1162xxx  production induced by il-1 and t n f
in these cultures. indeed pge 2 itself potently induced  xxxg1162xxx 
production by osteoblasts (figs. 2 and 3).
in view o f the possibility that sll-6rot present in conjunction with il-6 might also have stimulated the transfected ba/f3 cells, we assayed the sll-6rot concentrations
by elisa. in none o f the culture supernatants from these
experiments was sll-6rc~ detectable (detection limit 1 ng/ml;
data not shown). in contrast, the growth activity in the supernatants was completely neutralized by monoclonal m u fine anti-human  xxxg1162xxx  antibody (table 1). together, this
evidence indicated that the activity in the culture supernatants measured by the microassay was due to the presence
o f  xxxg1162xxx .

endogenous il- 11 production in cocultures of mouse bone marrow cells and primary osteoblasts. in view o f the importance
o f lot,25(oh)2d 3 in mediating osteoclastogenesis in the

monoclonal anti-human  xxxg1162xxx  antibody to abrogate osteoclast formation (15), we measured the effect of lot,25(oh)2d 3

duction stimulated by il-1 and t n f in our primary osteoblast cultures. prostaglandins are produced in bone by many
cells, especially by osteoblasts, and production is stimulated
by a variety of cytokines derived from macrophages or hemopoietic cells (34-38). the important role of pgs in il-1mediated osteoclast formation and bone resorption has
been emphasized (39), and pgs appear to be essential for
 xxxg1162xxx  mediated osteoclastogenesis as well (15). an il-1 response element exists close to the  xxxg1162xxx  gene and, in certain stromal cells il-1 can stimulate  xxxg1162xxx  by a mechanism
independent ofprostaglandins (40).
in the present study, the ability of lot,25(oh)2d 3 to potently stimulate  xxxg1162xxx  production was shown in osteoblasts
and in cocultures of osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. these
findings are consistent with a similar effect of la,25(oh)2d 3
in bone marrow cell cultures (15). the concentrations of
 xxxg1162xxx  present in supernatants of the co-cultures treated with
1ot,25(oh)2d3 exceeded 1 ng/ml after 3 d, which was in
accord with our previous estimate of the ec50 of exogenous  xxxg1162xxx  (~1.0 ng/ml) necessary for maximal osteoclastogenesis in such cocultures (16).
cytokines exert their pleiotropic effects by interacting
with specific cell surface receptors (11, 12). there is little
direct information about the  xxxg1162xxx  receptor in connective
tissue cells. during embryogenesis, primitive chondroblastic and osteoblastic progenitor cells seem to express higher
levels of a transcript homologous with il-11rot compared
to their more differentiated counterparts (13). our results
indicate that primary osteoblasts not only are a source of
 xxxg1162xxx , but express transcripts for the complete  xxxg1162xxx  receptor complex (il-11rot and gp130). this evidence suggests
that  xxxg1162xxx  acts in an autocrine-paracrine fashion. stimulation of primary osteoblastic cells by l&,25(oh)2d3, p t h
or il-1 upregulated gp130 mp, n a up to threefold at 24 h,
while m r n a levels for il-11tkot were unchanged. similar
2588

upregulation of gp130 mllna (and protein) expression by
lot,25(oh)2d 3 and p t h has been reported in routine
mc3t3-e1 cells and primary bone marrow cell cultures
(41). indeed, it has been proposed that regulation of gp130
expression by systemic hormones could modulate the sensitivity of osteoblasts to cytokines such as  xxxg1162xxx  and il-6sll-6rel (41, 42). it is not known if gp130 may be ratelimiting for cytokine signal transduction, in the way that
low levels of functional il-6 receptors limit responsiveness
of osteoblastic cells to il-6 under physiological circumstances (16, 17). expression o f g p l 3 0 is ubiquitous (26), but
it is possible that key target cells, such as bone marrow stromal cells might be relatively deficient in gp130 under certain conditions. further studies are required to confirm this
hypothesis.
we have reported that ocl formation is induced by at
least three different mechanisms (32, 33). the first mechanism is the pth-il-1-pge2 axis, which is mediated by signaling involving camp. the second mechanism is lo~,25
(oh)2d3-induced osteoclast formation, which is mediated
by the  xxxg2412xxx  but independent of camp. il-i
induces o c l formation by a mechanism involving pg
production (39). the gp130 signal, activated by cytokines
such as  xxxg1162xxx , il-6-sll-6p,xi, lif, or osm, is clearly an
additional and important pathway of o c l formation. we
previously showed that anti-il-6ro~ antibody inhibited
ocl formation by il-6-sll-6req but not by il-1 or lo~,25
(oh)2d 3 (16). this indicates that il-6 is not implicated in
osteoclastogenesis stimulated by il-1 or 1eq25(oh)2d3 . in
the present study, neutralizing anti-gp130 antibody, abolished osteoclast formation induced by il-1. moreover, the
antibody partially inhibited the osteoclastogenic effects of
pge2, pth, and lo~,25(oh)2d 3. this indicates that gp130
signals, probably evoked by  xxxg1162xxx , are indispensable for il-1
induced o c l formation. this is consistent with the ability

 xxxg1162xxx  and gpl30 signals in osteoclastogenesis

o f il-1 to induce both pge2 and  xxxg1162xxx  production by osteoblasts. similarly, we speculate that  xxxg1162xxx  contributes, at
least in part, to o c l formation induced by pge 2, p t h ,
and 1ot,25(oh)2d 3. girasole et al. also reported that a m o n o clonal anti- xxxg1162xxx  antibody inhibited p t h - , lot,25(oh)2d3-,
il-i-, or tnfot-mediated o c l formation by between 5 0 100% (15).
together, these results suggest that the gp130 signal is a
pivotal cofactor for osteoclast formation. targeted disruption of gpl30 may clarify the physiological role of  xxxg1162xxx 
and related cytokines in osteoclast formation and skeletal
development (43).
osteotropic factors appear to act directly on osteoblastic
cells, which in turn produce a factor responsible for osteoclast differentiation (17, 32). this putative factor may be
expressed on the cell surface membranes and plays a critical
role through a juxtacrine (cell-to-cell contact) mechanism.
in support of this concept, we recently estabhshed that the
ability of il-6 to induce osteoclast differentiation depends
on signal transduction mediated by il-6 receptors expressed
on osteoblastic cells but not on osteoclast progenitors (17).
in view o f this evidence, it is likely that  xxxg1162xxx  also induces
osteoclast formation by activating gp130 signals via  xxxg1162xxx 
receptors present on osteoblasts. in bone marrow cell cultures,
which are relatively deficient in stromal cells, exogenous
 xxxg1162xxx  is insufficient to trigger osteoclastogenesis (15), but
augments the effect o f lot,25(oh)2d 3, perhaps because
gp130 is upregnlated under these conditions.

the demonstration o f il-11ret m r n a expression in
mature ocls suggests an important biological function of
 xxxg1162xxx  in osteoclasts, perhaps distinct from its role in osteoclast formation. ohsaki et al. (44) demonstrated functional
il-6 receptors in human osteoclast-like cells derived from
giant cell tumors of bone. in these cells, il-6 appeared to
modulate bone resorbing activity. however, anti-gp130 antibody did not influence pit resorption by ocls (data not
shown).  xxxd1696xxx  and il-1
appear to promote survival of ocls (45), but we found
that  xxxg1162xxx  itself did not support o c l survival (data not
shown). further studies will be required to demonstrate
functional  xxxg1162xxx  receptors on ocls and elucidate the role
of  xxxg1162xxx  in mature osteoclasts.
in conclusion, normal osteoblasts are a source o f  xxxg1162xxx ,
the production o f which is induced by il-1, t n f , pge2,
p t h , and 1~x,25(oh)2d 3. bone resorbing hormones and
il-1 also upregulate gp130 m r n a in these cells and consequently cell responsiveness to  xxxg1162xxx  and related cytokines
may be enhanced. both osteoblasts and mature ocls express il-11rot m r n a and thus are potentially able to respond to  xxxg1162xxx . signals mediated by gp130 may be involved in physiological regulation of osteoclast formation
stimulated by osteotropic factors. since high local concentrations o f l l - 1 , t n f , and pgs occur in rheumatoid arthritis synovium (46),  xxxg1162xxx  could contribute to the excessive
osteoclastic bone resorption observed in that disease.
