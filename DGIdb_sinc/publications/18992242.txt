the aims of the current studies were to determine the in vitro and in vivo ocular and non-ocular pharmacological properties of cabergoline using well documented receptor binding, cell-based functional
assays, and in vivo models. cabergoline bound to native and/or human cloned serotonin-2a/b/c (5ht2a/b/c),
 xxxg1108xxx , 5ht7, a2b, and dopamine-2/3 (d2/3) receptor subtypes with nanomolar afﬁnity. cabergoline was an
agonist at human recombinant 5ht2,  xxxg1108xxx  and d2/3 receptors but an antagonist at 5ht7 and a2 receptors.
in primary human ciliary muscle (h-cm) and trabecular meshwork (h-tm) cells, cabergoline stimulated
phosphoinositide (pi) hydrolysis (ec50 ¼ 19  7 nm in tm; 76 nm in h-cm) and intracellular ca2þ ([ca2þ]i)
mobilization (ec50 ¼ 570  83 nm in h-tm; ec50 ¼ 900  320 nm in h-cm). cabergoline-induced [ca2þ]i
mobilization in h-tm and h-cm cells was potently antagonized by a 5ht2a-selective antagonist (m-100907,
ki ¼ 0.29–0.53 nm). cabergoline also stimulated [ca2þ]i mobilization more potently via human cloned
5ht2a (ec50 ¼ 63.4  10.3 nm) than via 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptors. in h-cm cells, cabergoline (1 mm)
stimulated production of pro-matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -3 and synergized with  xxxd1742xxx  to
enhance camp production. cabergoline (1 mm) perfused through anterior segments of porcine eyes caused
a signiﬁcant (27%) increase in outﬂow facility. topically administered cabergoline (300–500 mg) in dutchbelted rabbit eyes yielded 4.5 mm and 1.97 mm levels in the aqueous humor 30 min and 90 min post-dose
but failed to modulate intraocular pressure (iop). however, cabergoline was an efﬁcacious iop-lowering
agent in normotensive brown norway rats (25% iop decrease with 6 mg at 4 h post-dose) and in conscious
ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys (peak reduction of 30.6  3.6% with 50 mg at 3 h post-dose;
30.4  4.5% with 500 mg  xxxd2274xxx  h post-dose). in ketamine-sedated monkeys, iop was signiﬁcantly lowered at
2.5 h after the second topical ocular dose (300 mg) of cabergoline by 23% (p < 0.02) and 35% (p < 0.004) in
normotensive and ocular hypertensive eyes, respectively. in normotensive eyes, cabergoline increased
uveoscleral outﬂow (0.69  0.7 ml/min–1.61  0.97 ml/min, n ¼ 13; p < 0.01). however, only seven of the
eleven ocular hypertensive monkeys showed signiﬁcantly increased uveoscleral outﬂow. these data
indicate that cabergoline’s most prominent agonist activity involves activation of 5ht2,  xxxg1108xxx , and d2/3
receptors. since  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, 5ht7 antagonists, and a2 antagonists do not lower iop in conscious ocular
hypertensive monkeys, the 5ht2 and dopaminergic agonist activities of cabergoline probably mediated the
iop reduction observed with this compound in this species.

treatment of glaucoma reduce elevated intraocular pressure (iop),
one of the most important causative risk factors associated with
this disease (sugrue, 1997; clark and yorio, 2003; sharif and
klimko, 2007). although many classes of drugs are known to reduce
iop and some are used clinically (e.g. fp-class prostaglandins, bblockers, alpha-2 agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) (sugrue,
1997; clark and yorio, 2003; sharif and klimko, 2007), there
continues to be a need for more efﬁcacious agents that provide long
duration of iop reduction and agents with fewer undesirable ocular
and systemic side-effects.

n.a. sharif et al. / experimental eye research 88 (2009) 386–397

the biogenic amine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5ht) has
been identiﬁed in the aqueous humor of humans (martin et al., 1988;
martin et al., 1992; veglio et al., 1998), and numerous classes of 5ht
receptors have been identiﬁed in relevant ocular tissues, such as the
rabbit and human iris–ciliary body (tobin et al., 1988; chidlow et al.,
1995; harris et al., 2001, 2002), bovine ciliary epithelium (inouematsuhisa et al., 2003), human ciliary muscle (lograno and romano,
2003; sharif et al., 2006a,b), and human trabecular meshwork (sharif
and senchyna, 2006; sharif et al., 2006a,b). these ﬁndings have
generated interest regarding the role that serotonin might have in
modulating and controlling iop. indeed, a number of 5ht2 receptor
agonists, such as (r)-doi (may et al., 2003; gabelt et al., 2005), amethyl 5ht (may et al., 2003), and al-34662 (may et al., 2006; sharif
et al., 2007) have been shown to be effective in lowering iop in the
lasered monkey model of ocular hypertension and represent a potential new class of topical ocular hypotensive agents. another amine,
dopamine (da), has also been found in the aqueous humor (cooper
et al., 1984; trope et al., 1987) and various da receptor subtypes are
present in relevant ocular cells/tissues (mancino et al., 1992). in addition, dopaminergic agonists have been shown to elicit ocular hypotension in a number of species, mainly rabbits, but under speciﬁc
conditions (chu et al., 1999; ogidigben et al., 1993; chiou and li, 1992;
crosson et al., 1987; potter and burke, 1982; ohia et al., 2005) and by
apparently suppressing aqueous humor production (lograno et al.,
1990; chu et al., 2000). two dopaminergic agonists, bromocriptine and
sdz-glc-756, administered topical ocular, were shown to lower iop in
some human subjects (geyer et al., 1987; mekki et al., 1983; prunte
et al., 1997), while intravenous  xxxd2097xxx  raised iop (piltz et al.,
1998). interestingly, a  xxxg655xxx  agonist, ibopamine, increased
aqueous humor production in glaucomatous and normotensive
patients and increased iop (virno et al., 1996).
cabergoline (fig. 1) is an agent that has been used to treat
parkinsonian symptoms (grondin et al., 1996) and to reduce
prolactin release by virtue of its da agonist activity (colao et al.,
2006). it also has shown promise as a potential drug to treat restless
leg syndrome (nardone et al., 2006). since a number of other ergot
derivatives (bromocriptine, lergotrile,  xxxd2498xxx  and pergolide) have
been shown to reduce iop in some animals (potter et al., 1998;
mekki et al., 1983), we decided to evaluate the pharmacological
properties of cabergoline in ocular and non-ocular cells, to determine its iop-lowering activity in a number of animal species, and to
determine its ability to modulate aqueous humor dynamics in
cynomolgus monkey eyes.

human cerebral cortex homogenates was performed in the
absence or presence of 10 mm methiothepin to deﬁne total and
non-speciﬁc binding, respectively, as previously described (may
et al., 2003). additional studies to determine the relative afﬁnity
and selectivity of 5ht2 antagonists using [125i]-doi binding to
cho cells expressing human cloned 5ht2a, 5ht2b, 5ht2c
receptors were conducted at cerep inc. (poitiers, france).
ligand binding to  xxxg1108xxx  receptors was performed as previously
described (sharif et al., 2004) using membranes from cho cells
expressing the cloned human  xxxg1108xxx  receptor. other radioligand
binding assays for various receptors, ion-channels, transporters,
etc. were performed at novascreen biosciences corp. (hanover,
md) using 1 nm, 100 nm and 10 mm of the test agent using standard
published procedures (sweetnam et al., 1993,1995).
2.2.  xxxd1773xxx  production in cultured cells
direct agonist-dependent inhibition or stimulation of forskolinstimulated  xxxd1773xxx  formation was measured by a method
described previously (crider et al., 2003; sharif et al., 2004).
immortalized human corneal epithelial (cepi-17-cl4) cells
expressing endogenous 5ht7 receptors (crider et al., 2003), human
cloned  xxxg1108xxx  receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells
(sharif et al., 2004), ht-29 human colonic epithelial cells expressing endogenous alpha-2a receptors (bylund, 1992) and h-cm cells
were used for camp response studies with cabergoline.
2.3. camp measurements
camp production was measured using an eia kit purchased
from amersham pharmacia biotech (piscataway, nj). this assay was
conducted according to the package insert in an automated manner
using the biomekò 2000 robot (beckman instruments; fullerton,
ca) (crider et al., 2003; sharif et al., 2004).
2.4. cell culture conditions
primary cultures of normal human ciliary muscle (h-cm) cells
were established from cm tissue isolated from ﬁve different human
donors’ eyes with no reported ocular diseases (ages 33–75 years;
three males and two females) (zhan et al., 1998; husain et al., 2002;
sharif et al., 2006). h-cm cells were prepared from normal human
cadaver eyes using the procedure previously described (zhan et al.,
1998; husain et al., 2002). the human eyes were obtained from
life-point ocular tissue division (storm eye institute, musc,
charleston, sc). brieﬂy, ciliary muscles were dissected with the aid
of a dissecting microscope under sterile conditions, cleaned, and
cut into 1–2 mm pieces. the explants were placed in dmem containing 2 mg/ml collagenase type ia, 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs),
and 50 mg/ml gentamicin and then incubated for 1–2 h at 37  c
with occasional shaking. when a major part of the explant was
dispersed into single cells or groups of cells, the cell suspension was
centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min and resuspended in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx , 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml  xxxd164xxx  and maintained in a 5%
co2 humidiﬁed atmosphere. the conﬂuent cells were sub-cultured
at a split ratio of 1:4 using 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% edta. cultures
of primary human trabecular meshwork (h-tm) cells were established from tm tissue derived from up to 20 human donors’ eyes
(ages 48 days–95 years) as previously described (sharif and senchyna, 2006; sharif et al., 2006a,b).
2.5. phosphoinositide (pi) turnover assays

fig. 1. the chemical structure of cabergoline is shown. the chemical name of cabergoline is: 1-[(6-allylergolin-8b-yl)carbonyl]-1-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl]-3-ethylurea.

the relative agonist activity of serotonergic compounds at the
 xxxg1113xxx  was determined in vitro using the ability of the

388

compounds to stimulate the production of [3h]-inositol phosphates
in h-cm and h-tm cells by anion exchange chromatography as
previously described (sharif et al., 2006a,b,2007) .
2.6. [ca2þ]i mobilization assays
the receptor-mediated mobilization of intracellular calcium
([ca2þ]i) was studied using the fluorescence imaging plate reader
(fliprò system, mds analytical technologies, a division of mds,
inc., sunnyvale, ca) instrument as previously described (kelly et al.,
2003; kelly and sharif, 2006). the h-tm and h-cm cells from
numerous donors were used in these studies.

non-fat dry milk (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) followed by
incubation with antibodies to pro- xxxg1418xxx , pro- xxxg1428xxx , or prommp-3 for 12 h at 4  c with gentle shaking. after washing, these
membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies
(hrp-conjugated; dilution 1:3000) for 1 h at 20  c. pre-stained
proteins and molecular weight markers were run in parallel. for
chemiluminescent detection, the membranes were treated with
enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (amersham pharmacia, piscataway, nj); and the signal was quantiﬁed using a bio-rad versadoc imaging system (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) (husain
et al., 2005).
2.9. anterior segment perfusion studies

2.7. aequorin-based intracellular [ca2þ]i mobilization assay
aequorin-based intracellular [ca2þ]i mobilization assays
involving chinese hamster ovary (cho)-k1 cells transfected with
the full-length human 5ht2a,b,c receptors were utilized to determine agonist potency of various agents. these studies were performed at euroscreen sa, gosselies, belgium. in brief, functional
response at the  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes was determined using
cho-k1 cells stably expressing mitochondrially-targeted bioluminescent aequorin, ga16, and one cloned human 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, or
5-ht2c  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx . prior to testing, cells were loaded in
suspension with coelenterazine for 4–16 h and directly injected
onto different concentrations of the test compound. light emitted
from the cells was measured 20–30 s following receptor activation.
a functional drug discovery system (fdss)-6000 luminometer
(hamamatsu photonic systems, bridgewater, nj) was used to record
luminescence in response to the test compound. the mean
response signal at each of 8–11 different concentrations was integrated to provide an estimation of receptor activation, expressed as
the ec50 value. the efﬁcacy of the response (emax) at the 5-ht2a and
5-ht2b receptors was expressed relative to the response of
a-methyl-5-ht under the same assay conditions, the efﬁcacy at
5-ht2c was expressed relative to the response of 5-ht.

experiments were performed as previously described by webb
et al. (2006). porcine eyes were obtained from a local abattoir. after
removal, eyes were transported in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (ph 7.4) and received within 12 h of death. each eye was
bisected at the equator and the lens removed. the remaining
choroid, iris, and ciliary body were gently teased away. isolated
corneoscleral shells were then attached to a perfusion chamber and
perfused with dmem supplemented with 50 u/ml penicillin and
50 mg/ml streptomycin. the entire perfusion apparatus was placed
in an incubator at 37  c and 5% co2. perfusion pressure was
maintained at a constant level of 8 mmhg, and the rate of ﬂuid
outﬂow was monitored continuously by measuring the rate of ﬂuid
ﬂow from a reservoir by means of an analytical balance (model
accu 124; fisher scientiﬁc, pittsburgh, pa). the rate of ﬂuid ﬂow
was recorded by the computer (dellô, round rock, tx; with collect
xl software labtronics, inc., guelph, ontario, canada). outﬂow
facility was calculated every 2 min as the ratio of ﬂow rate to
perfusion pressure (in microliters per minute  mmhg). preparations were allowed to stabilize for 4–5 h and baseline facilities were
then recorded for 40–60 min. only preparations with stable baselines and basal facilities ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 (in microliters per
minute  mmhg) were used in these studies. cabergoline (1 mm)
was then introduced into the perfusion system by media exchange.

2.8. pro-matrix metalloproteinases studies
2.10. formulations of cabergoline for in vivo studies
h-cm cells isolated from multiple human donor eyes were
cultured as described above. these h-cm cells were serum-starved
for 24 h prior to the addition of any agent. cells were then incubated with vehicle, cabergoline (1 mm), or positive control for 24 h
at 37  c. at the end of the incubation period, the medium was
collected and concentrated ten-fold using centricon concentrators
(millipore corp., bellireca, ma). equivalent volumes of this
concentrate were loaded onto 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels
(sds-page) and the proteins were separated and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. the membranes were blocked with 5%

for each set of studies, cabergoline was freshly prepared in
a variety of vehicles. the most common vehicle was: 0.5%
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (hpmc, the suspending agent);
0.05% polysorbate 80 (a nonionic surfactant that wets the suspended particles); 0.2% dibasic sodium phosphate buffer (buffering agent); 0.75% nacl (tonicity agent); 0.01% disodium edetate
dihydrate (preservative aid); 0.01% benzalkonium chloride
(preservative); ph adjusted to 6–7.4 using naoh and/or hcl; qs
100% puriﬁed water. different buffering agents were used,

data are average inhibition values from 2 determinations at each concentration of
cabergoline. the minus signs signify an apparent stimulation of binding but these
values are physiologically insigniﬁcant. data were generated at novascreen (hanover, md) using previously described methods and reagents (sweetnam et al., 1993,
1995). the bolded receptors and associated data appear signiﬁcant.

aqueous humor samples were placed into 1.5 ml cryovials and
frozen on dry ice. samples were stored at 70  c until analysis.
aqueous humor samples were quickly thawed and stored on ice.
50 ml of aqueous humor was removed from the sample vial and
transferred to a new tube. 50 ml of 50% methanol containing an
appropriate internal standard was added to the 50 ml aliquot of
aqueous humor. the mixture was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at
4  c for 10 min. the supernatant was then transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis.
aqueous humor samples were quantiﬁed by lc/ms/ms using an
agilent 1100 series hplc (waters corporation, milford, ma)
coupled with a sciex api 3000 (mds analytical technologies,
concord, ontario) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in apci
positive ion mode following a 25 ml sample injection. ms/ms
detection of carbergoline was conducted using a parent molecular
mass of 452.5 mu and a transition ion of 381.5 mu. hplc chromatographic separation of cabergoline was performed using
a watersò xbride c18, 4.6  30 mm, 3.5 mm column. the aqueous
(a) and mobile phases (b) consisted of 10 mm ammonium formate
and 10 mm ammonium formate in acetonitrile, respectively. the
compound was eluted from the column using a fast gradient
ramping from 75:25 (a:b) to 2:98 (a:b) over 2 min at a ﬂow rate of
0.35 ml/min. the lower limit of quantitation (lloq) for the assay
was 0.26 ng/ml with an upper limit of 5220 ng/ml.
2.12. acute iop response in rats, rabbits and cats
intraocular pressure (iop) was measured in conscious adult
brown norway rats (200–300 g, mam,), dutch-belted rabbits (1.2–
1.7 kg, myrtles rabbitry, thompson station, tn), and mixed breed
cats (2.4–5.2 kg; perkasie, ny) as previously described (husain
et al., 2006; sharif et al., 2001; may et al., 2003). rat iops were
measured using a tonolab tonometer (colonial medical supply co.,
inc., franconia, nh; husain et al. 2007) and rabbit and cat iops were
taken with a pneumatonometer (alcon ptg, alcon laboratories,
inc., fort worth, tx or model 30 classicô pneumatonometer,
xomed, jacksonville, fl). after baseline iop measurements (usually
two averaged), test compound was instilled in one or both eyes of
the animal and subsequent iop measurements taken at timed
intervals.
2.13. acute iop response in cynomolgus monkeys

including acetic acid (to make acetate buffer) and  xxxd1710xxx  (to
make citrate buffer).
2.11. ocular bioavailability studies
each dutch-belted rabbit received a 30 ml, bilateral topical
ocular dose of cabergoline (formulated as a 1% suspension). two
animals at each time point (30 and 90 min) were euthanized, eyes
thoroughly rinsed, and the aqueous humor collected immediately.

iop was determined in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys
(mixed gender; originally obtained from charles river primate
corp. and lasered at alcon) with an alcon pneumatonometer after
light corneal anesthesia with 0.1% proparacaine as previously
described (sharif et al., 2001; may et al., 2003). eyes were rinsed
with one or two drops of saline after each measurement. after
a baseline iop measurement, test compound was instilled in one or
two aliquots to the hypertensive eyes of nine cynomolgus monkeys.

fig. 2. stimulation of pi turnover and [ca2þ]i mobilization in h-tm cells. fig. 2a shows the ability of cabergoline and serotonin to concentration-dependently stimulate pi hydrolysis
and promote the accumulation of [3h]-inositol phosphates ([3h]-ips) in cultures of h-tm cells. the ability of cabergoline (10 nm–100 mm) to promote [ca2þ]i mobilization in h-tm
cells over 180 s is depicted in fig. 2b.

vehicle was instilled in the hypertensive eyes of six additional
animals. subsequent iop measurements were taken at 1, 3, 6, and
occasionally 24 h. right eyes of all animals had undergone laser
trabeculoplasty to induce ocular hypertension. all left eyes were
normal and untreated.
2.14. aqueous humor dynamic studies
thirteen female cynomolgus monkeys between the ages of 3
and 12 were included in the study. all had unilateral laser
treatment to the trabecular meshwork of the left eye. lasering had
been done between 0.2 and 8.3 years before the study. not all
of the lasered eyes had elevated iop at the time of the
measurements.
measurements were made on baseline day and after cabergoline
treatment to both eyes. sedation was induced by ketamine
hydrochloride (hcl), 1–5 mg/kg, administered intramuscularly
5 min before each measurement to achieve pharmacological
restraint. animals were seated in specially designed chairs for all
tonometry, pachymetry and ﬂuorophotometry measurements.
fifteen hours prior to each study day, iop1 was measured with
a pneumatonometer (model 30 classicô pneumatonometer,
reichert, depew, ny) after topical application of proparacaine hcl,

0.13%. fluorescein (10% in 2% agar gel) was applied to the cornea
using iontophoresis for 2 min in the normotensive eyes and 3 min
in the hypertensive eyes. cornea thickness and anterior chamber
depth were measured with slit-lamp pachymetry; cornea diameter
was measured with calipers. cornea and anterior chamber volumes
were calculated. measurements commenced at 8:30–9:00 a.m. the
following day with tonometry (iop2). the ﬂuorescence of the
cornea and anterior chamber were measured in duplicate with
a scanning ocular ﬂuorophotometer (fluorotronô master model
fm-2, ocumetrics, inc., palo alto, ca). scans were taken at 45 min
intervals for a total of 4 sets. these data were used to determine
aqueous ﬂow (fa).
after the fourth set of scans and another iop measurement
(iop3), an intramuscular injection of acetazolamide (12–20 mg/kg)
was administered for the purpose of reducing iop and reducing
aqueous ﬂow. fluorophotometric scans and iop measurements
were repeated at 0.75, 1.50 and 2.25 h after acetazolamide injection. fluorophotometric outﬂow facility (cﬂ) was calculated as the
ratio of the change in aqueous ﬂow to the change in iop. uveoscleral outﬂow (fus) was calculated by the equation fus ¼ fa  cﬂ
(iop3  pev) where pev is the episcleral venous pressure. a pev value
of 13 mmhg was used based on an earlier study in the monkeys
(toris et al., 2000,2003,2005,2006).

data are mean  sem from 4 experiments for h-tm cells. data from two individual experiments are shown for h-cm cells.

treatment measurements were collected between 1 and 4
months after baseline measurements. between baseline and
treatment day, one monkey developed an infection requiring
antibiotic treatment. the infection was unrelated to the study and
the antibiotic was discontinued prior to measurement day thus was
not expected to affect the results. within 3 h of the ﬁrst dose, drug
was mixed with vehicle to a concentration of 1.0% and the ph was
adjusted to 7.4 with hcl. the drug did not dissolve unless the ph
was properly adjusted. the drug was stored in a refrigerator until
30 min before use. iop1 was measured at 4.30–5.00 p.m. on the day
preceding the day of ﬂuorophotometry. iontophoresis was performed and then 30 ml of cabergoline 1.0% (300 mg), was applied to
both eyes. the day of ﬂuorophotometry, iop was measured
immediately before (iop2; 9:00 a.m.) and 2.5 h after (iop3; 11:30
a.m.) the second dose of drug of cabergoline. fluorophotometry
commenced 30 min after the second dose of cabergoline. values
were compared between eyes on each day and baseline values were
compared with post-treatment values using student’s two-tailed
paired t-test. values are reported as means  standard deviation
(sd).

2.15. data analyses
all functional and binding data were expressed as mean  standard
error of mean (sem) of data obtained from multiple experiments. in
vivo data values are reported as means  standard deviation (sd) or
mean  sem. sample optical density (od) readings were compared to
the standard curve and the camp content of each sample was evaluated by linear regression analysis using the excelò (microsoftò,
redmond, wa) software package.
the potencies (ec50 or ic50 values) of agonists and antagonists
were determined from the concentration-response curves using
a sigmoidal-ﬁt, iterative algorithm of a computer program
designed to automatically ﬁt the raw data (activitybase, idbs,
surrey, uk). the relative intrinsic activities (emax values) of the
agonists were determined relative to reference agents (5ht for
serotonergic-based studies; norepinephrine for adrenergic-based
studies) where the maximal response was set to 100%. concentration-response curves and other plots for the manuscript were
constructed using originó software package (microcalò software,
inc., northampton, ma).

ligand binding and functional antagonist ic50 values were
calculated and converted into equilibrium antagonist afﬁnities and
potencies (ki values), respectively, as previously described (sharif
et al., 2001, 2006a,b, 2007). the various treatments were statistically compared using non-parametric multiple hypothesis techniques (kruskal–wallis), assuming that a p-value of less than 0.05
denoted signiﬁcance.
for the anterior eye segment perfusion studies, the data were
analyzed by the unpaired t-test. comparisons yielding p < 0.05
were considered signiﬁcant. for the aqueous humor dynamics,
drug treatment was compared with baseline by two-tailed paired ttests.
2.16. chemicals and materials
additional materials including compounds, reagents and
chemicals of high quality were purchased from sigma–aldrich, co.
(st. louis, mo). cabergoline and other speciﬁc compounds were
synthesized at alcon. other reagents used in the current studies:
all tissue culture media, antibiotics, supplements and trypsinedta (life technologies; grand island, ny); fetal bovine serum
(hyclone; logan, ut);  xxxd2154xxx , ammonium formate, licl, and
type b gelatin (sigma–aldrich co.; st. louis, mo); [3h]- xxxd2360xxx  and [125i]-doi (amersham corp., deerﬁeld, il); ag 1-x8
anion exchange resin (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca); ecolume scintillation ﬂuid (icn biomedicals, inc.; costa mesa, ca).
flipr and [ca2þ]i mobilization assay kit and associated buffers
were purchased from molecular devices corp. (menlo park, ca).
alcaineò was obtained from alcon laboratories, inc.; 0.1%
proparacaine was prepared from alcaine diluted with 0.9% saline
(prepared in-house).

3.2. functional assay data
in cell-based functional assays, cabergoline behaved as an
agonist and stimulated pi turnover in h-tm, h-cm, and in rat
vascular smooth muscle (a7r5) cells (table 3; fig. 2a), and also
mobilized [ca2þ]i in these same cells and via human cloned 5ht2a–
2c receptors (table 4; fig. 2b). cabergoline was more potent in the
pi assays than in the [ca2þ]i assays (tables 3 and 4) and it appeared
to be more potent in the human ocular cells than in the rat a7r5

cells (tables 3 and 4). the effects of cabergoline and 5ht on [ca2þ]i
mobilization in h-cm and h-tm cells were antagonized most
potently and selectively by the 5ht2a-receptor-selective antagonist, m-100907 (table 5). in terms of adenylyl cyclase-coupled
receptors, cabergoline exhibited agonist properties at the  xxxg1108xxx 
and several dopamine receptor subtypes (table 6) as reported in
the literature (newman-tancredi et al., 2002a,b). cabergoline
stimulated  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp production in h-cm cells in
a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 3). in h-cm cells, cabergoline (1 mm) stimulated production of pro- xxxg1418xxx , pro- xxxg1428xxx ,

3.3. anterior segment perfusion data
continuous perfusion of cabergoline (1 mm) over 240 min in ﬁve
separate porcine eye anterior segments resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in outﬂow facility relative to the vehicle-treated eyes
(fig. 5). statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) increase in outﬂow facility
was observed beginning an hour from time zero and the outﬂow
facility continued to increase up to the last time-point (240 min)
studied. the maximum increase in outﬂow facility induced by
cabergoline was 27% relative to the vehicle-treatment effect (fig. 5)
achieved after 2 h perfusion with the drug.
3.4. in vivo studies data
topical ocular dosing of dutch-belted rabbits with 300 mg
cabergoline and (r)-doi resulted in micromolar concentrations of
each compound in the aqueous humor. the respective concentrations of cabergoline in the aqueous humor 30 min and 90-min postdose were: 4.54  0.78 mm and 1.97  0.23 mm (n ¼ 4 eyes per
group). however, topical ocular dosing of cabergoline (500 mg)
failed to signiﬁcantly alter iop in dutch-belt rabbits out to 4 h postdose and in cats out to 5 h post-dose (table 7). cabergoline did
lower iop in brown norway rats (22.5% reduction with 6 mg at 5 h
post-dose; table 8) and in conscious ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys (30.4% reduction with 500 mg  xxxd2274xxx  h post-dose;
tables 9 and 10).
cabergoline formulated in a variety of different buffers reduced
iop in ocular hypertensive monkey eyes by about the same extent
(25.8–32.8% with 50 mg at 6 h post-dose) (table 9). in addition, the
ocular hypotensive effect of cabergoline was dose-dependent
(table 10). a duration of action study revealed efﬁcacious iop
reduction with twice-daily topical ocular dosing (50 mg) out to 16 h
post-dose (table 11).
aqueous humor dynamic studies using a single topical ocular
dose (300 mg) of cabergoline in sedated cynomolgus monkey eyes
revealed a signiﬁcant iop reduction in normotensive and

393

hypertensive eyes, and a 2.33-fold increase in uveoscleral outﬂow
in the normotensive eyes (table 12). while there was increased
uveoscleral outﬂow in 7 of 11 ocular hypertensive eyes, the mean
difference between baseline and drug treatment did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance (table 12). additionally, the three-fold
increase in outﬂow facility also did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
a number of dopaminergic ligands and those with mixed
dopaminergic and serotonergic activities tested topical ocular (up
to 300 mg) in hypertensive eyes of conscious cynomolgus monkeys
failed to induce biologically signiﬁcant iop-reduction in most cases
(table 13).

4. discussion
cabergoline is an ergoline that has been used or is of high
potential for a number of clinically relevant diseases such as parkinson’s disease, hyperprolactinemia and restless leg syndrome
(see section 1). the potent dopaminergic agonist activity of
cabergoline has been associated with its therapeutic efﬁcacy in
these diseases. to our knowledge, the ocular hypotensive activity of
cabergoline has not been previously reported.
the current studies, along with some literature information
(newman-tancredi et al., 2002a,b) have helped identify cabergoline’s signiﬁcant agonist activity at 5ht2 receptor subtypes and
 xxxg1108xxx  receptors and apparent antagonist activity at 5ht7 and
alpha-2 adrenoceptors (tables 1 and 2). the results from these
studies are consistent with the idea that agonist activity at 5ht2
receptors (tables 3–5) are responsible for cabergoline’s efﬁcacious
iop-lowering activity in cynomolgus monkeys. broad ligand
binding studies revealed that cabergoline can bind with a medium/
high afﬁnity to dopamine-2, alpha-2 adrenergic, and serotonin-1
and serotonin-2 receptor binding sites (table 2). however, a more
detailed assessment of subtypes within each of these family of
receptors indicated that cabergoline possessed the highest and
perhaps most relevant afﬁnity for  xxxg1108xxx ,  xxxg1110xxx , 5ht 2a–c, 5ht7, a2a, d2, d3, d4 and d5 receptors (table 1). this interaction translated
into agonist activity at  xxxg1108xxx , 5ht2a, d2, and d3, receptors but
antagonist activity at 5ht7 and a-2a–c receptors (tables 3–6). even
though we could demonstrate agonist activity of cabergoline at the
5ht2 receptor family in h-cm and h-tm cells (tables 3–5), the latter
cells, along with immortalized npe cells, failed to show any functional expression of  xxxg1108xxx , a-2 or dopamine receptors. consequently, while cabergoline has complex multi-pharmacophoric
activities, it would appear that some or all may be responsible for
its observed in vivo ocular hypotensive efﬁcacy.
certain dopaminergic agonists such as the ergoline derivatives
(bromocriptine, lergotrile, and pergolide) (potter and burke, 1982),
and others such as  xxxd2498xxx  (potter et al., 1998), 1-substituted benzyloctahydroisoquinoline derivatives (saha et al., 2001), bicyclic
hexahydroaporphines (ohia et al., 2005), and phenylethylamine
analogs of dopamine lowered iop in rabbits and in cats (potter and
burke, 1985) primarily by inhibiting aqueous humor formation
(reitsamer and kiel, 2002), and/or by inhibiting pre-junctional
dopaminergic receptors and/or post-junctional peripheral adrenoceptors. in our experiments, cabergoline failed to inﬂuence iop

in rabbits or in cats (table 7) despite achieving a reasonably high
aqueous humor concentration after topical ocular dosing, indicating that it’s dopaminergic activity may be counter-acted by its
other pharmacological activities. interestingly, however, cabergoline at a fairly low topical ocular dose lowered iop in brown norway
rats (table 8). these data indicate a strong species-dependent effect
for cabergoline, and such observations are not unprecedented.
thus, while the dopaminergic agents bromocriptine, lergotrile, and
pergolide produced moderate ocular hypotension in rabbits, they
failed to lower iop in monkeys (potter and burke, 1982). even the
most efﬁcacious dopaminergic ocular hypotensive agent in the
monkeys eyes, a selective d2 agonist (n-0437), only acutely reduced
iop (crosson et al., 1987), and an ergoline (cianergoline) produced
only a slight ocular hypotensive effect in monkeys (potter and
shumate, 1987). furthermore, in humans, an intravenously
administered d1 agonist,  xxxd2097xxx  (piltz et al., 1998) and
a topical ocularly applied d1 agonist, ibopamine (virno et al., 1996),
actually increased iop by stimulating aqueous humor production in
both normotensive and glaucomatous eyes. in order to address
these conﬂicting ﬁndings, we tested a variety of dopamine
receptor-selective agents in our ocular hypertensive monkeys but
none of these compounds exhibited any biologically signiﬁcant
iop-lowering activity in this model unless they also had additional
receptor activities or were tested at fairly high doses (table 13).
thus, we concluded that the dopaminergic activities of cabergoline
are probably not responsible for its potent and efﬁcacious ocular
hypotensive activity in the glaucomatous monkey eyes although
a component of its iop-lowering effect may be mediated via da
receptors. the pronounced iop reduction observed with cabergoline in our ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys is most likely
induced by its serotonergic receptor activities since another agent
(s()-terguride) with 5ht and da activity also lowered iop
whereas ‘‘pure’’ da agonists had minimal effects by themselves.
since  xxxg1108xxx  and 5ht7 receptor-ligands failed to modulate the
monkey iop (may et al., 2003; sharif et al., 2006), the remaining
5ht2 agonist activity of cabergoline may be responsible for its
ocular hypotensive actions. our recent studies with a number of

other 5ht2 agonists that efﬁcaciously lower iop in the conscious
ocular hypertensive monkey lend support to this conclusion for
cabergoline (may et al., 2003,2006; sharif et al., 2006a,b, 2007).
furthermore, like other ocular hypotensive 5ht2 agonists (may
et al., 2003, 2006; sharif et al., 2006a,b, 2007), cabergoline was able
to activate functional receptors in h-cm and h-tm cells in vitro
(figs. 2 and 3; tables 3 and 4), activities that were potently blocked
by selective 5ht2 receptors antagonists, in particular the 5ht2a
antagonist, m-100907 (table 5). given the similarity of monkey
eyes with human eyes, and the similarity of responses to various
pharmacological agents (clark and yorio, 2003; sharif and klimko,
2007), we would expect that 5ht2 receptors are indeed present and
are responsible for mediating the ocular hypotensive effects of
cabergoline in the monkey. however, this needs to be determined.
topical ocularly applied cabergoline lowered iop in hypertensive eyes of conscious monkeys regardless of the buffered vehicle in
which it was formulated in (table 9). cabergoline in citrate buffer,
acetate buffer, and citrate buffer containing xanthum gum
produced a very similar time-course and maximal level of ioplowering (table 9). cabergoline formulated in the most commonly
used vehicle (see section 2.10) dose-dependently and efﬁcaciously
reduced iop in ocular hypertensive monkey eyes with an apparent
maximal effect being produced by 50 mg cabergoline (tables 9 and
10). interestingly, a 10-fold higher topical ocular dose (once daily)
of cabergoline did not cause tachyphylaxis of the ocular hypotensive response in these animals. however, using the 50 mg ocular
dose of cabergoline, we showed that twice-daily topical ocular
dosing with the compound resulted in a steady diminution of the
iop-lowering effect (table 11). a pronounced tachyphylactic
response appeared to be established sixteen hours after the eighth
dose. it is not known whether such a response would be observed
in human subjects.
in order to determine the possible mechanism(s) of action of
cabergoline, the iop-lowering response due to a single topical
ocular dose was ﬁrst reproducibly demonstrated in the hypertensive eyes of ketamine-sedated cynomolgus monkeys (table 12).
interestingly, cabergoline was able to increase the uveoscleral

(p < 0.01) and by 1.6-fold in the ocular hypertensive eyes (did not
reach statistical signiﬁcance) (table 12) with no apparent statistically signiﬁcant changes in the other parameters in both sets of
eyes, although there was an apparent 3-fold increase in outﬂow
facility in the hypertensive eyes (table 12). similar increases in
uveoscleral outﬂow were found in ocular normotensive monkeys
treated with r-doi, a 5ht2a receptor agonist (gabelt et al., 2005).
encouraged by these observations, we were able to more conclusively demonstrate a robust stimulation of the conventional
outﬂow pathway for aqueous humor using perfused porcine eyes in
vitro in the presence of 1 mm cabergoline (fig. 5). using cultured
human ciliary muscle cells, we showed that cabergoline’s molecular mechanism of action probably involves production of matrix
metalloproteinases ( xxxg1418xxx –3) (fig. 4) that can be envisioned to remodel the outﬂow pathway to promote aqueous humor drainage to
lower iop as has been shown for fp-class prostaglandins (weinreb
et al., 1997; husain et al., 2005). however, another mechanism of
action of cabergoline may involve its relaxant effect on the ciliary
muscle, as has been reported for porcine pulmonary arteries (jahnichen et al., 2005). one potential way that cabergoline may induce

a
vehicle yielded 14.4%, therefore the drug effect was biologically insigniﬁcant.
iop reduction 20% is of marginal biological signiﬁcance.

such relaxant effects may be through stimulating the production of
camp that we observed in h-cm cells exposed to  xxxd1742xxx  (fig. 3;
wiederholt et al., 2000). however, the direct muscle relaxant
effects of cabergoline on ciliary muscle need to be addressed in
future studies.
in view of the value of potential neuroprotective effects of ocular
hypotensive agents, it was of interest to note that cabergoline has
been shown to protect neuronal cells against oxygen-glucose
deprivation insults (lombardi et al., 2002; miglio et al., 2004), to
scavenge free radicals (yoshioka et al., 2002) via its anti-oxidant
properties (finotti et al., 2000; yoshida et al., 2002), and to cause
the release of numerous growth factors from astrocytes (ohta et al.,
2003). therefore, cabergoline appears to be both an ocular hypotensive and a neuroprotective drug.
in conclusion, in vitro studies have demonstrated a polypharmacological proﬁle for cabergoline, with agonist activities at
dopamine, 5ht2, and  xxxg1108xxx  receptors and antagonist effects at
alpha-2 adrenoceptors and 5ht7 receptors. while cabergoline was
an efﬁcacious ocular hypotensive agent in rat and monkey eyes, it
failed to reduce iop in rabbits and cats. in sedated monkey eyes,

cabergoline mediated its iop-lowering activity by stimulating
uveoscleral outﬂow, while in perfused porcine eyes in vitro, it
increased trabecular outﬂow facility. the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of action of cabergoline may involve the release of
matrix metalloproteinases and/or a relaxation of the ciliary muscle.
