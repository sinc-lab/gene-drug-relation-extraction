the multidomain chimeric enzyme,  xxxg131xxx  (fdh),1 is a natural fusion of two unrelated
genes (1). the enzyme converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10formyl-thf) to tetrahydrofolate (thf) in an nadp⫹-dependent dehydrogenase reaction or an nadp⫹-independent hydrolase reaction (2– 4). fdh is a homotetramer of 902-amino acid
residue monomers (5, 6). each monomer consists of two functional domains, amino- and carboxyl-terminal, connected by
about a 100-amino acid residue linker which is not part of
either catalytic domain (1, 5, 7, 8). the carboxyl-terminal domain of fdh is up to 50% homologous to proteins from a family
of aldehyde dehydrogenases (1, 9). expressed separately, this
domain possesses aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (7) as well
as the full-length fdh (1). the hydrolase activity resides in a
310-amino acid residue amino-terminal domain of fdh (ntfdh) (5, 8) which also can be expressed separately as a functional protein (8). the dehydrogenase reaction requires participation of the second, aldehyde-dehydrogenase homologous,
functional domain and occurs only when the two domains work
in concert, having been combined in one polypeptide (5, 7, 8).
the amino-terminal domain of fdh bears the folate-binding
site and reveals sequence identity to other enzymes that use
10-formyl-thf as a substrate (1, 8). in the cell, 10-formyl-thf
is used in three biosynthetic reactions where it serves as a
formyl donor (10). two of the reactions are involved in de novo
purine biosynthesis (11) and are accomplished by  xxxd149xxx 
ribonucleotide formyltransferase (gart, ec 2.1.2.2) (12) and
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (ec 2.1.2.3) (13). the reactions result in incorporation of
two carbons into the purine ring. another minor biosynthetic
reaction that requires 10-formyl-thf is formylation of the
amino acid in methionyl-trna (14). this is a specialized trna
used for initiation of translation in prokaryotes, distinct from
the one involved in methionine incorporation during polypeptide chain elongation. such a formylation is also encountered in
chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotes (14). the reaction
is catalyzed by 10-formyltetrahydrofolate:l-methionyl-trna
n-formyltransferase (fmt,  xxxg1472xxx ) (14).
despite low overall sequence identity, 10-formyl-thf-utilizing enzymes bear some common structural elements (1, 8).
thus, there are two strictly conserved residues, an aspartate

the enzyme,  xxxg131xxx 
(fdh), converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formylthf) to tetrahydrofolate in an nadpⴙ-dependent dehydrogenase reaction or an nadpⴙ-independent hydrolase
reaction. the hydrolase reaction occurs in a 310-amino
acid long amino-terminal domain of fdh (nt-fdh),
whereas the dehydrogenase reaction requires the fulllength enzyme. the amino-terminal domain of fdh
shares some sequence identity with several other enzymes utilizing 10-formyl-thf as a substrate. these enzymes have two strictly conserved residues, aspartate
and histidine, in the putative catalytic center. we have
shown recently that the conserved aspartate is involved
in fdh catalysis. in the present work we studied the role
of the conserved histidine, his106, in fdh function. sitedirected mutagenesis experiments showed that replacement of the histidine with alanine, asparagine, aspartate,
glutamate, glutamine, or arginine in nt-fdh resulted in
expression of insoluble proteins. replacement of the histidine with another positively charged residue, lysine,
produced a soluble mutant with no hydrolase activity.
the insoluble mutants refolded from inclusion bodies
adopted a conformation inherent to the wild-type ntfdh, but they did not exhibit any hydrolase activity. substitution of alanine for three non-conserved histidines
located close to the conserved one did not reveal any
significant changes in the hydrolase activity of nt-fdh.
expressed full-length fdh with the substitution of lysine
for the his106 completely lost both the hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities. thus, our study showed that
his106, besides being an important structural residue, is
also directly involved in both the hydrolase and dehydrogenase mechanisms of fdh. modeling of the putative hydrolase catalytic center/folate-binding site suggested that
the catalytic residues, aspartate and histidine, are unlikely to be adjacent to the catalytic cysteine in the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center. we hypothesize
that 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase reaction is not an independent reaction but is a combination of hydrolase and
aldehyde dehydrogenase reactions.

mechanism of fdh catalysis

experimental procedures

materials—10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate (10-formyl-ddf) and 5,8dideazafolate (ddf) were obtained from dr. john b. hynes, department of pharmaceutical chemistry, medical university of south carolina. all media were obtained from difco or life technologies, inc.
sds-page standards were purchased from amersham pharmacia biotech. other chemicals were obtained from sigma.
site-directed mutagenesis—we used the quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (stratagene) to introduce point mutations into nt-fdh
cdna cloned to prset vector (36) or into full-length fdh cdna cloned
to pvl 1393 vector (37). after introduction of mutation the vector was
transformed into escherichia coli xl-1 blue cells using a standard
protocol, and the cells were grown on lb ampicillin plates to allow
mutant selection. plasmids were isolated by using quantum prep kit
(bio-rad) and sequenced to identify clones carrying the mutation. the
entire coding region of the clones carrying the designed mutations was
sequenced to ensure the absence of random mutations.
expression of nt-fdh mutants—expression of nt-fdh mutants has
been done as we described earlier (36). the vector with mutation was
transformed into e. coli bl21 (de3) cells (novagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, and the cells were grown in 4 ml of nzcym
medium containing ampicillin (50 mg/ml) overnight at 37 °c with shaking. the 100 ml of nzcym medium containing ampicillin was inoculated with the overnight culture and incubated at 37 °c with shaking
until a600 ⫽ 0.6 (about 6 h) followed by induction with isopropyl-␤-dthiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). three hours after
induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 ⫻ g, 10 min),
resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 2 mm edta, and
0.1% triton x-100), and incubated for 30 min with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme
at 37 °c. the suspension was chilled on ice and sonicated (3 times for
30 s). the insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation
(18,000 ⫻ g, 15 min). the pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of 6 m urea by
continuous stirring for 1 h at 4 °c. the supernatant and the dissolved
pellet were examined for the presence of the nt-fdh by sds-page and
immunoblot technique.
purification of soluble h106k mutant of nt-fdh—the mutant was
purified using the procedure that we developed earlier (36) for wild-type

nt-fdh. all buffers used in the purification steps contained 1 mm
nan3. the supernatant of cell lysate (2 ml) obtained as described above
was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.4, and was
then passed through a 0.2-mm filter (nalgene) to remove insoluble
contaminants. purification was done on a deae-memsep 1000 hp ion
exchange membrane chromatography cartridge (millipore) with a linear nacl gradient (0 – 0.4 m in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4) using a consep
lc100 chromatographic system (millipore). lysate samples of 1 ml
each containing about 4 mg of total protein were applied in the chromatography run. the chromatography was done at a flow rate of 4.0
ml/min, and fractions of 0.8 ml were collected. the fractions were
analyzed for the presence of nt-fdh by sds-page. the fractions
containing nt-fdh were combined, dialyzed against 20 mm tris-hcl,
ph 7.4, concentrated on centricon 10 (amicon-millipore), and stored at
4 °c in the presence of 1 mm nan3 and 10 mm  xxxd26xxx .
purification of insoluble mutants of nt-fdh—after dissolving the
pellet in 6 urea, the sample (0.1 mg/ml protein) was dialyzed against
20 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.5, for 18 h at 4 °c. insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation (18,000 ⫻ g, 15 min), and the soluble sample
was subjected to the chromatography procedure on ion-exchange resin
as described for the soluble h106k mutant.
expression of mutants of full-length fdh—the expression of the
full-length fdh mutants has been done in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as we described previously (37). the vector
carrying mutated fdh cdna and linearized acnpv viral dna was
co-transfected into sf9 cells using the baculogold transfection kit
(pharmingen, san diego, ca) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
recombinant viral stock was amplified in sf9 cells to produce high titer
virus stock.  xxxd102xxx  cells were seeded as a monolayer in 25-cm2 flasks
(about 2 ⫻ 106 cells per flask) and grown overnight. each flask was
infected with 0.1 ml of high titer virus stock. culture medium and cells
were collected separately 2– 4 days post-infection, and the recombinant
protein production was detected by sds-page (38) followed by western immunoblot analysis (39). for large scale recombinant protein
production,  xxxd102xxx  cells were seeded in 225-cm2 flasks (about 20 ⫻
106 cells per flask), and after growing overnight each flask was infected
with 1.0 ml of high-titer virus stock. the culture medium 96 h postinfection was collected, centrifuged to remove detached cells, and used
to isolate recombinant protein.
purification of fdh mutant—all buffers used in purification steps
contained 10 mm  xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm nan3. mutants were purified from the
cell-free culture medium by affinity chromatography on a column of
sepharose-5-formyltetrahydrofolate essentially as we described earlier
(40). a column (1.5 ⫻ 10 cm) was packed with about 8.0 ml of settled gel
and equilibrated with 10 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.4, containing 10 mm
 xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm nan3 (buffer 1). medium (200 ml) plus  xxxd26xxx  (10 mm)
and nan3 (1 mm) was applied to the affinity column. the column was
then washed with buffer 1 containing 1 m kcl (100 ml). the enzyme was
eluted from the column with buffer 1 containing 1 m kcl and 20 mm folic
acid. the eluate was passed through a column of bio-gel p6-dg (biorad) equilibrated with buffer 1 to remove unbound folate. the eluate
was concentrated to ⬃5 ml using an amicon (beverly, ma) filtration
cell. additional purification was done on a mono q column with a linear
kcl gradient (0 – 0.5 m in buffer 1) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (amersham pharmacia biotech).
analysis of the mutant proteins—sds-page was carried out according to the method of laemmli (38) in 8.0 or 12.5% gel. western immunoblot analysis was performed as described by burnette (39) with rabbit
polyclonal antiserum against pure rat liver fdh and goat anti-rabbit
igg conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (bio-rad) (41). protein concentration was determined using the protein assay of bradford (42). amino-terminal sequence analysis of wild-type and mutant proteins was
carried out in the vanderbilt medical center core facility using automated edman degradation with gas phase analysis on an lf-3000
(beckman instruments) or an applied biosystem 470a (perkinelmer
life sciences) protein sequencer.
assay of enzyme activity—all assays were performed at 30 °c in a
shimadzu 2401pc double beam spectrophotometer. for measurement
of hydrolase activity, the reaction mixture contained 0.05 m tris-hcl,
ph 7.8, 100 mm  xxxd26xxx , and 5 ␮m substrate 10-formyl-ddf. 10-formylddf is an alternative, stable substrate for the enzyme (40). the reaction was started by the addition of enzyme (1–20 ␮g) in a final volume
of 1.0 ml and read against a blank cuvette containing all components
except enzyme. appearance of product 5,8-dideazafolate (ddf) was
measured at 295 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 18.9 ⫻ 103
(43). addition of nadp⫹ to the reaction mixture provided a measure of
both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities, i.e. total activity of the
enzyme. hydrolase activity measured in the absence of nadp⫹ was

and a histidine located within the most conserved region in the
middle of the enzyme molecules (1, 8). it has been suggested
that these residues participate in folate binding and/or catalysis (1, 15). an aspartate/histidine pair is found as a catalytic
dyad or part of catalytic triad in the active site of a number of
enzymes including serine proteases (16 –18), serine carboxypeptidase (19),  xxxg1759xxx  (20), dienelactone hydrolase (21, 22),  xxxg1963xxx  (23), and a variety of zinc-dependent enzymes (24). from the group of 10-formyl-thf-converting
enzymes, the gart mechanism and structure have been studied in more detail (15, 25–27) including resolution of several
crystal structures of the enzyme (28 –31). it was shown that
replacement of the conserved aspartate with asparagine resulted in catalytically inactive enzyme (15). later it was shown
that both conserved residues, the aspartate and the histidine,
are adjacent to the folate substrate bound to gart (28, 30) and
are involved in the enzyme catalysis (25). replacement of either of the residues resulted in an enzyme with substantially
reduced activity, whereas the double mutant was completely
inactive (25). studies on another enzyme, fmt, also showed
that these residues are in close proximity to each other within
the substrate binding pocket (32), and they are involved in the
enzyme catalysis (33). the third 10-formyl-thf utilizing enzyme, aicar formyltransferase, that carries out a reaction
very similar to that of gart, also revealed the presence of the
histidine and aspartate (34). in contrast to gart and fmt,
however, it has been shown that these residues are not involved in aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase function (34). this led to the conclusion that they
are just part of a common structural element. recently, we
have shown (35) that similar to gart and fmt the conserved
aspartate is involved in fdh catalysis. in the present work we
studied the role of another conserved residue, histidine 106, in
the fdh mechanism.

results

site-directed mutagenesis of histidine 106 in nt-fdh—we
mutated histidine 106 in the nt-fdh sequence to alanine and
expressed the mutant in e. coli. we found that the mutant was
expressed at a high level but as an insoluble protein, although
a small portion of it was released into the soluble cell fraction
(fig. 1). we were unable to purify the mutant from the soluble
fraction because it precipitated and disappeared on any purification step apparently due to its incorrect folding. this implies that the residue is an important structural element. the
fact that the histidine is important to support the protein
structure does not mean, however, that the residue is not
involved in catalysis also. therefore, we replaced the histidine
with several other amino acids trying to select a suitable substitution that would fit in the protein structure better than

fig. 1. expression of nt-fdh mutants. the mutants were detected in the soluble (s) and insoluble (i) cell fraction by sds-page
with coomassie staining. immunoblot stained with fdh-specific antiserum is shown for h106a mutant. st., protein standards (phosphorylase b, 94 kda; bovine  xxxg124xxx , 67 kda; ovalbumin, 43 kda;
carbonic anhydrase, 30 kda; and soybean  xxxd207xxx , 20.1 kda).
position of nt-fdh (shown by arrows) corresponded to its molecular
mass of 34 kda. about 10 –12 ␮g (insoluble fraction) and about 5 ␮g

alanine. this histidine is strictly conserved in sequences of
10-formyl-thf-utilizing enzymes. another enzyme, 10-formylthf synthetase that synthesizes 10-formyl-thf from thf
and formate also reveals elements of the conserved motif (fig.
2). besides this motif and the conserved aspartate, there is no
further identity between 10-formyl-thf synthetase and 10formyl-thf-utilizing enzymes. in contrast to 10-formyl-thfutilizing enzymes, 10-formyl-thf synthetase has glutamate or
glutamine instead of the conserved histidine, although the rest
of the conserved motif is identical among the proteins (fig. 2).
therefore, we used these substitutions in order to study
whether they would result in expression of soluble protein. we
also changed the histidine to the positively charged amino
acids, arginine and lysine, and to asparagine which is often
used as a replacement for histidine in site-directed mutagenesis. when the mutants were prepared we found that we accidentally introduced aspartate for histidine in another mutant.
this mutant was also expressed and studied. thus, six mutants were expressed as follows: h106n, h106d, h106q,
h106e, h106r, and h106k. out of the six mutants only
h106k was expressed as a soluble protein, although a significant portion (about 40%) was still insoluble (fig. 1). all other
mutants were completely insoluble. no hydrolase activity was
detected in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate for the h106k
mutant. to study further the properties of h106k mutant, it
was purified using ion-exchange chromatography as we described previously (36). it demonstrated chromatographic behavior during the purification similar to that of the wild-type
nt-fdh (data not shown) and was purified to near-homogeneity (fig. 3). analysis of the amino-terminal sequence of the
mutant showed that the sequence corresponded to the original
sequence of nt-fdh. the cd and fluorescence spectra of the
h106k mutant were identical to those for wild-type nt-fdh
(data not shown). assay of the hydrolase activity of the purified
h106k mutant showed that it completely lost activity.
refolding and analysis of histidine 106 mutants—we studied whether insoluble his106 mutants of nt-fdh could be refolded into soluble proteins. for this purpose we dissolved the
insoluble cell fraction in 6.0 m urea to destroy inclusion bodies
and then dialyzed the solution against low salt buffer to remove
urea and to recover recombinant proteins. we found that this
simple procedure resulted in conversion of a significant portion
of insoluble mutants into soluble proteins. about 80 –90% of the
recombinant proteins was recovered as soluble material. the

subtracted from the total activity to give the dehydrogenase activity.
dehydrogenase activity was also measured independently using the
increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of nadph and the
molar extinction coefficient of 6.2 ⫻ 103. aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed using  xxxd3026xxx  essentially as described by lindahl
and evces (44) with our modifications (7). the reaction mixture contained 50 mm caps buffer, ph 9.4, 5 mm  xxxd3026xxx , 1 mm nadp⫹, and
enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. activity was estimated from the
increase in absorbance at 340 nm.
fluorescence studies—fluorescence experiments were done on a
perkinelmer life sciences 650-40 or hitachi f-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. emission fluorescence spectra of wild-type and mutant
enzymes were recorded by scanning from 300 to 460 nm with fluorescence excitation at either 280 or 295 nm. protein samples (0.1 mg/ml)
were in 20 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.5. emission fluorescence spectra of
ans complexed to nt-fdh were recorded by scanning from 400 to 600
nm with fluorescence excitation at 360 nm. protein samples (0.1 mg/ml)
were preincubated with ans (3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m) in 20 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph
7.5, for 30 min. all experiments were done at room temperature.
ligand binding studies—binding of 10-formyl-ddf and ddf to the
nt-fdh mutants was detected by measuring the quenching of protein
tryptophan fluorescence as we described previously (8, 35). protein
samples (about 10.0 nm) were in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.8. the concentrations of ligands were varied from 2 to 2000 nm for 10-formyl-ddf
and from 50 nm to 40 ␮m for ddf. the experiments were done at 25 °c.
fluorescence excitation was at 291 nm, and the emission was monitored
at 340 nm. the data were corrected for dilution effect, for 10-formylddf or ddf intrinsic fluorescence, and for absorptive screening caused
by ddf. intrinsic fluorescence of 10-formyl-ddf or ddf was measured
experimentally. in case of ddf the observed fluorescence signal was
multiplied by the correction factor, c, to obtained the corrected data.
the correction factor was calculated according to the equation c ⫽
10⌬a/2, where ⌬a is the absorbance of ddf at the excitation wavelength
(45). kd values for the ligands were calculated from data on fluorescence
quenching in the presence of ligands that were plotted in a linear form.
the value (1 ⫺ f/fo)⫺1 was plotted against the inverse of ligand concentration (46). this is a modified form of the classical stern-volmer
plot that relates the decrease in fluorescence to the concentration of a
collisional quencher (47). f is intrinsic fluorescence observed at a
quencher concentration; fo is fluorescence in the absence of quencher.
the slope of the line (least squares fit) gave a kd value. variation of the
measured values was about 5%.
analysis of conformation by cd spectroscopy—far-uv cd spectra
were obtained on an jasco 720 spectrometer. the concentration of
wild-type and mutant proteins was in the range of 0.3– 0.5 mg/ml in 50
mm phosphate, ph 7.0. spectra were recorded at 25 °c using cylindrical
quartz cuvette with path length of 0.1 cm. for each sample, three
separate spectra were collected and averaged using a step interval of
1.0 nm. the protein spectra were corrected by subtracting a blank
solution containing 50 mm phosphate. the final results are reported as
mean residue ellipticity in units of degree䡠cm2䡠dmol⫺1 calculated using
a mean residue weight of 115.0.
modeling of structure of nt-fdh—structure of the central region of
nt-fdh molecule including 74 amino acid residues was generated using
a swiss-model server that provides fully automated comparative protein modeling (48 –50). four crystal structures from brookhaven protein data bank were submitted as templates: 1fmt, 2fmt, 1gar and
3gar. the model was visualized and analyzed using swiss-pdb
viewer (50) and rasmol (glaxo wellcome).

mutants were purified to near-homogeneity in one step by
ion-exchange chromatography (fig. 3). analysis of the hydrolase activity of the refolded mutants showed that none of them
possessed the activity (table i). based on the limit of the assay,
we estimated that the mutants had less than 0.02% activity of
the wild-type nt-fdh. thus, we assumed that the mutants
were practically inactive. to exclude the possibility that the
loss of the enzyme activity was due to misfolding or conformational changes, cd and fluorescence spectra were obtained for
each of the purified mutants as well as for wild-type protein.
cd and fluorescence spectroscopy are often used to confirm
structural integrity of recombinant proteins (51). comparison
of cd spectra of wild-type and mutant nt-fdh (data not
shown) did not reveal any differences in the content of secondary structure elements indicating absence of global conformational changes in the mutants. emission fluorescence spectra
were also identical for all mutants and the wild-type nt-fdh
with the maximum at 337 nm (data not shown). this showed
that the environment of tryptophan/tyrosine residues was not
altered suggesting that protein conformation was not disturbed. we also monitored fluorescence of ans, a commonly
used label for characterization of hydrophobic pockets within
the protein molecule (52), added to the mutants and wild-type
nt-fdh. an increase in quantum yield and a blue shift in the
emission maximum wavelength reflects binding of ans to hydrophobic sites in proteins (52). the emission fluorescence
spectra of ans bound to mutants or wild-type proteins were

identical (data not shown) demonstrating similar fold of hydrophobic pockets within the proteins.
unfolding/refolding of wild-type nt-fdh—as a control experiment wild-type nt-fdh was subjected to the same unfolding/refolding procedure to study whether it influences protein
conformation and activity. after denaturing by dissolving in
urea, the wild-type protein renatured during dialysis, and
about 100% of the material was recovered as a soluble protein.
the refolded wild-type nt-fdh displayed the same cd and
emission fluorescence spectra as non-treated enzyme (data not
shown). analysis of hydrolase activity of the refolded wild-type
nt-fdh showed that it retained almost 100% activity of nontreated wild-type nt-fdh (table i) and displayed a similar km
(7.3 ␮m for the native enzyme and 8.8 ␮m for the treated
enzyme). based on these experiments we concluded that the
unfolding/refolding procedure was adequate to restore the natural conformation of the protein.
site-directed mutagenesis of non-conserved histidines in the
putative folate-binding region—when we studied the role of
the conserved asp142 in fdh mechanism, we mutated to alanine all other aspartates located within the putative folatebinding domain. six non-conserved aspartate residues out of
the total of 14 aspartates in nt-fdh sequence were replaced
(35). none of the replacements resulted in change of the enzyme activity, supporting the importance of asp142. in the
present work we used the same approach to ensure that only
the conserved histidine is important for catalysis, and loss of
the activity was specific due to replacement of a catalytic residue but not due to a general tendency of the enzyme to lose
activity in response to amino acid substitutions. nt-fdh has
total of eight histidine residues, four of which are located in the
putative folate-binding domain. replacement of his100 and
his125 with alanine did not reveal any changes in protein
expression or in the enzyme activity in comparison to the
wild-type nt-fdh (data not shown). in contrast, the h113a
mutant was expressed as an insoluble protein (data not
shown). this mutant, however, was recovered after refolding as
a soluble protein, and it displayed hydrolase activity identical
to that of the wild-type enzyme (table ii). thus, none of the
histidines except the conserved one was crucial for the hydrolase activity. these results support the conclusion about direct
involvement of the conserved histidine 106 in fdh catalysis. in
addition, the fact that the insoluble h113a mutant was refolded into a completely active enzyme provides supportive
evidence that insoluble his106 mutants were also refolded into
correct conformation, and the loss of activity was due to replacement of a catalytically important residue rather than due
to disturbance of protein conformation.

discussion

earlier we expressed in e. coli wild-type nt-fdh and several
mutants where the conserved aspartate residue in the putative
folate-binding region was replaced (35). all the mutants as well

as wild-type enzyme were soluble proteins. in contrast, replacement of his106 with several other residues resulted in expression of a completely insoluble protein suggesting that the residue is essential for folding or stability of the entire aminoterminal domain of fdh. this could be the reason that this
residue has been preserved during evolution and is consistent
with the suggestion that the residue is an important structural
element (34). proteins expressed in e. coli are often insoluble
because the polypeptide chain does not readily adopt its native
conformation due to absence of appropriate conditions (53). in
the case where the wild-type protein is soluble but the mutant
is insoluble, it could be that the mutation affects protein stability (54). it has been shown, however, that many amino acids
in a protein sequence can be freely replaced with little or no
effect on protein stability (55, 56). a kinetic model has proposed
that the yield of native protein depends only on the rate of
protein synthesis, the rate of folding, and the rate of aggregation (57). thus, alternatively, it could be that substitution of
the conserved histidine in nt-fdh sequence does not affect
protein stability but decreases significantly the rate of folding
shifting the reaction to the side of unfolded protein precipitation and formation of inclusion bodies. the question of insoluble recombinant protein refolding has been widely addressed in
the literature, and procedures were developed to obtain soluble
protein from inclusion bodies (55, 58). in our experiments we
were able to recover all histidine mutants as soluble proteins.
the refolded mutants were indistinguishable from the wildtype protein as judged by different conformational criteria.
they also bound folate ligands with the same affinity as wildtype nt-fdh. based on the above we concluded that refolded
mutants adopted conformation inherent to the wild-type protein. thus, his106 is important for correct protein folding rather
than for maintenance of the already folded conformation. none
of the refolded mutants, however, possessed hydrolase activity,
implying that his106 is an important catalytic residue. together with the studies on the only soluble mutant, h106k, the
experiments showed that his106 is an important structural
residue and at the same time is directly involved in enzyme
catalysis.
the fact that the conserved aspartate and histidine are essential residues for several 10-formyl-thf-utilizing enzymes
implies that these enzymes might have similar catalytic mech-

ligand binding study—we studied binding of 10-formylddf and ddf to the purified mutant proteins using the
method of titration of tryptophan fluorescence (46, 47). we used
this approach previously to study binding of 10-formyl-ddf
and ddf to full-length fdh, nt-fdh, and nt-fdh aspartate
mutants (7, 8, 35). surprisingly, we observed that mutation of
the histidine did not change the binding affinity of nt-fdh to
the substrate of the hydrolase reaction, 10-formyl-ddf, or the
product of the reaction, ddf (table i). earlier we suggested (8)
that his106 might form a hydrogen bond with the formyl group
of the folate substrate. therefore, we expected that replacement of the residue would decrease the affinity of the protein to
the ligand. one explanation for the obtained results could be
that the hydrogen bond is formed only during the hydrolase
reaction. since we performed fluorescence quenching under
conditions where the reaction did not take place, we did not see
interaction of the residue with the ligand. for fmt it has been
also shown that, although the conserved histidine that corresponds to his106 of fdh is involved in enzyme catalysis, its
replacement does not change affinity of the protein to the folate
substrate (33).
site-directed mutagenesis of histidine 106 in fdh—to study
the role of the conserved histidine in fdh function, we changed
the residue in the full-length enzyme to lysine. the h106k
fdh mutant was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system as we described previously (37). we used
this expression system versus expression in e. coli because we
showed (36) earlier that, in contrast to nt-fdh, the full-length
enzyme was expressed in e. coli as insoluble protein. the
h106k mutant was expressed in insect cells in amounts similar to that of the wild-type fdh (fig. 4). this protein was found
to be soluble and was purified using affinity chromatography
on immobilized 5-formyl-thf-sepharose (37). similar to the
wild-type enzyme the mutant remained bound to the affinity
column during washing with 1.0 m nacl and was eluted from
the column by 20 mm folate. additional purification of the
h106k mutant has been done on a mono q column. the twostep procedure gave a preparation that was close to homogeneity (fig. 4). all three activities, i.e. hydrolase, dehydrogenase,
and aldehyde dehydrogenase, inherent to the wild-type fdh
were assayed for the mutant. we observed that the mutant
displayed aldehyde dehydrogenase activity similar to the wildtype fdh (data not shown). as expected, similar to the nt-fdh
mutant, the h106k fdh mutant completely lost hydrolase
activity. assay of fdh dehydrogenase activity revealed that
together with the hydrolase activity the fdh mutant also lost
the dehydrogenase activity. we must mention that expression
of another full-length fdh mutant, h106a, resulted in insoluble recombinant protein (data not shown) further supporting
involvement of his106 in folding of the amino-terminal domain.

anisms. at the same time the mechanisms should be distinctive
since gart/fmt carry out  xxxg25xxx  reaction, whereas the
fdh amino-terminal domain carries out a hydrolase reaction.
it was found that a third residue, an asparagine, that is two
residues upstream of the histidine, is also important for gart
and fmt function (25, 33). the fact that fdh does not have the
conserved asparagine is probably a reflection of the difference
in the enzyme mechanisms. fdh has isoleucine in this position
instead of asparagine and that is not even a conservative substitution (1). an enzyme, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase,
also catalyzing hydrolysis of 10-formyl-thf to thf and formate, was found in e. coli (59, 60). although the e. coli hydrolase carries out the same reaction as the fdh hydrolase reaction, it has a higher sequence identity to gart (61) than to the
amino-terminal domain of fdh (8). besides, similar to gart
and fmt, the e. coli hydrolase has all three putative catalytic
residues, an aspartate, a histidine, and an asparagine (59).
although the role of these residues in the enzyme mechanism
has not yet been studied, the difference in sequence between e.
coli hydrolase and fdh might suggest that the same reaction
is carried out by two different mechanisms. indeed, the role of
the conserved aspartate and histidine should be more profound
in the fdh mechanism than in the e. coli hydrolase mechanism since the residues are critical for both fdh activities,
hydrolase and dehydrogenase (35). this also suggests that the
two fdh mechanisms, the hydrolase and the dehydrogenase,
are coupled, and the dehydrogenase mechanism is not independent from the hydrolase mechanism.
based on crystal structures of two proteins sharing some
sequence similarity with nt-fdh, i.e. gart and fmt, we
assumed that the conserved histidine is located in a ␤-sheet
near the end of a ␤-strand. this apparently explains why replacement of the histidine has a greater impact on protein
structure compared with replacement of the conserved aspartate in nt-fdh located in the flexible loop. we must mention,
however, that replacement of the conserved histidine in fmt
did not result in insoluble mutant protein (33). comparison of
crystal structures of fmt (residues 1–189) and gart showed
that they have a similar fold despite low sequence identity (32).

fig. 6. hydrogen bond network within nt-fdh folate-binding
site. the hydrogen bonds (shown by dashed lines) were calculated from
the nt-fdh model analyzed with swiss pdb viewer (50). figure shows
the hydrogen bonds distances. the distances between the side chain
oxygens of the conserved asp142 and the side chain nitrogens of the
conserved his106 are as follows: a–c, 4.28 å; a–d, 4.81 å; b–c, 3.76 å;
b–d, 3.65 å.

we suggest that the corresponding region of nt-fdh should
also have a similar structure. by using swiss-model, a fully
automated comparative protein modeling facility (48 –50), and
gart/fmt structures as templates, we have built a model of
the central part of nt-fdh including 74 amino acid residues
(fig. 5a). this region has the highest identity among 10formyl-thf-utilizing enzymes and includes the conserved histidine and aspartate residues. in fmt and gart structures,
this part of the protein sequence forms a hydrophobic cleft that
serves as a folate-binding pocket. although comparative pro-

mechanism of fdh catalysis

fig. 7. proposed mechanism for 10-formyl-thf hydrolase reaction. the formyl oxygen atom is hydrogen-bonded to his106 that helps to
withdraw electrons and activates the formyl carbon atom for nucleophilic attack. the side chain oxygen of asp142 tightly binds a molecule of water
and activates it by withdrawing a proton. the reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl ion on the formyl carbon atom, resulting
in formation of the tetrahedral transition intermediate (step i). this reaction goes through the mechanism of basic catalysis. electron rearrangement and transfer of a proton from the molecule of water to the cofactor n10 is mediated through asp142. thus, asp142 works as a relay system
withdrawing and donating a proton. the bond between carbon atom of formyl group and n10 of folate can be further cleaved to release  xxxd2154xxx 
and thf (step ii).

is involved in both fdh catalytic centers. analysis of the folatebinding site model revealed that two catalytic residues in the
hydrolase catalytic center, his106 and asp142, are located on the
bottom of the cavity that forms the substrate-binding pocket
and are not exposed on the protein surface (fig. 5, c and d).
the dehydrogenase reaction requires participation of cys707 (6)
which serves as a nucleophile and is located inside the carboxyl-terminal domain about 12 å from the surface as deduced
from the crystal structure of aldehyde dehydrogenase (63).
such a structural arrangement should not sterically allow the
cysteine to be within the hydrolase catalytic center and be in
close contact with the two hydrolase catalytic residues. this in
turn suggests that the cysteine does not work simultaneously
and in concert with the histidine and aspartate in the enzyme
mechanism, but their actions are rather sequential. thus, we
further propose that the 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase reaction is not a separate reaction but is a conjugation of two
sequential reactions as follows: a hydrolase and an aldehyde
dehydrogenase. in this case the 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase
mechanism includes the hydrolase reaction as an essential
part, and the hydrolase reaction should always precede the
dehydrogenase reaction. it also makes sense with respect to the
biological role of the hydrolase reaction; the reaction is not an
element of a “futile” cycle if it is working together with 10formyl-thf synthetase but is an essential part of 10-formylthf dehydrogenase mechanism. we propose the following
mechanism for the hydrolase reaction (fig. 7). in this mechanism we assume that the tightly bound molecule of water plays
the role of a nucleophile or catalytic base. such a role for a
water molecule activated by an aspartate residue has been
postulated for a number of enzymes (64 – 68). a potential catalytic role of a water molecule ordered by a hydrogen bond with
the carbonyl group of the conserved aspartate was also proposed for gart (30). in the proposed mechanism the transition
intermediate is actually a hydrated aldehyde. it has been
shown recently that the folate analog, 10-formyl-5,8,10-trideazafolate, at neutral ph exists in the form of hydrated aldehyde
(gem-diol) (27). apparently, the role of the hydrolase mechanism in the dehydrogenase reaction is to facilitate formation of
the hydrated aldehyde and to stabilize it within the catalytic
center (step i). in the absence of nadp⫹ this intermediate can
be further cleaved to release formate (step ii). in the presence
of nadp⫹ the formyl group is cleaved from the intermediate
with oxidation to co2, evidently through an aldehyde dehydrogenase-like mechanism. we note that the 10-formyl-thf dehydrogenase reaction is not exactly an aldehyde dehydrogenase
reaction since the carbon atom is at the same oxidation level as

tein modeling is a form of structure extrapolation, it has been
proven to be of value and reliable enough to yield useful model
structures (49). the model showed a fold similar to the corresponding region in gart/fmt structures (fig. 5b) and location of the histidine and the aspartate within the presumable
folate-binding cleft (fig. 5, c and d). several other important
assumptions were made from analysis of the model. the model
showed that the conserved histidine is located in a ␤-strand
(fig. 5b) and is buried deep within the protein core. the position of the side chain of the conserved his106 is stabilized by
two hydrogen bonds formed between the histidine ring and
oxygens of the side chain of ser108 and main chain of gly115
(fig. 6). one oxygen of the side chain of conserved asp142 is also
hydrogen-bonded to gly115 (fig. 6). thus, the conserved gly115
might be one of the factors that brings the two catalytic residues, his106 and asp142, in close proximity to each other. it is
remarkable that all four residues are conserved in the structures of nt-fdh/gart/fmt. for gart it has been shown that
the aspartate is located in a flexible loop, the mobility of which
is important for the enzyme mechanism (31). apparently, this
hydrogen bond network is necessary to orient catalytically important residues in the right conformation and to fix the flexible aspartate to allow the reaction to proceed. the model
further revealed that the conserved asp142 similar to his106 is
buried in the protein core. hydrogen bond donors and acceptors
that are buried inside the protein normally form hydrogen
bonds within the protein (62). however, analysis of the model
showed that one oxygen of asp142 side chain is not involved in
hydrogen bonding. we suggest that this oxygen is hydrogenbonded to a molecule of water that is not seen in the model.
this suggestion is based on the crystal structure of gart
where one ordered water molecule has been found close to the
catalytic center (30). interestingly, the model gives a probable
explanation of our results on site-directed mutagenesis of the
three non-conserved histidine residues. two of the residues,
his100 and his125, are located on the protein surface aside from
the hydrophobic cleft, and replacement of these residues did
not reveal any changes in nt-fdh properties. the third histidine, his113, substitution of which resulted in expression of
insoluble protein, is located close to the conserved his106 and is
also buried in the protein core. apparently, this part of the
molecule is important for the folding of the entire structure,
and replacement of residues within this region can affect the
protein properties.
the present study provides strong evidence that histidine
106 is an essential residue for both hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities of fdh, suggesting that similar to asp142, his106

mechanism of fdh catalysis
it is in  xxxd2154xxx . however, this step, similar to the aldehyde
dehydrogenase reaction, oxidizes the carbon atom just one level
up. in the aldehyde dehydrogenase mechanism the substrate
forms a thiohemiacetal intermediate with a cysteine residue
(69 –71). apparently, in the case of fdh, a similar intermediate
should be formed with cys707. at present it is unclear what the
intermediate in the dehydrogenase reaction is and how such an
intermediate is formed. it becomes obvious, however, that a
thiohemiacetal intermediate is unlikely to exist within the
hydrolase catalytic center, and transfer of an intermediate of
the hydrolase reaction to the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic
center should occur to allow a thiohemiacetal intermediate
formation. further studies are undertaken to explore the dehydrogenase mechanism.
