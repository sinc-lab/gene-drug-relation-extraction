the naturally occurring polyamines, spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx , and their precursor putrescine, play indispensible roles in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells, from basic dna synthesis to regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. the rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic
enzymes,  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) and s- xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase, are essential for mammalian development, with
knockout of the genes encoding these enzymes,  xxxg1626xxx  and  xxxg152xxx , causing early embryonic lethality in mice. in muscle, the involvement of
polyamines in muscle hypertrophy is suggested by the concomitant increase in cardiac and skeletal muscle mass and polyamine levels in
response to anabolic agents including b-agonists. in addition to b-agonists, androgens, which increase skeletal mass and strength, have also
been shown to stimulate polyamine accumulation in a number of tissues. in muscle, androgens act via the  xxxg183xxx  to regulate
expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzyme genes, including  xxxg1626xxx  and  xxxg152xxx , which may be one mechanism via which androgens
promote muscle growth. this review outlines the role of polyamines in proliferation and hypertrophy, and explores their possible actions
in mediating the anabolic actions of androgens in muscle.

the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  are
considered to be essential growth factors in virtually all
eukaryotic cells (marton and pegg, 1995). among the proposed
roles of polyamines are the functioning of ion channels
(williams, 1997), nucleic acid packaging (ruan et al., 1994),
signal transduction (bachrach et al., 2001), dna and protein
synthesis (panagiotidis et al., 1995), cell proliferation, and
differentiation (oredsson, 2003), as well as regulation of gene
expression (igarashi and kashiwagi, 2000). although emerging
studies have shown that the concentration of polyamines is
carefully regulated, and that they are required for normal cell
proliferation and differentiation (igarashi and kashiwagi, 2000),
their physiological signiﬁcance in speciﬁc tissues is still not well
understood. in skeletal muscle, regulation of polyamine levels is
associated with muscle hypertrophy and atrophy, yet the
underlying mechanisms of polyamine actions are not well
deﬁned. therefore, this review will focus on the role of
polyamines in skeletal muscle growth and hypertrophy, as well
as their possible role as target mediators of the anabolic actions
of androgens in skeletal muscle.
polyamine synthesis and degradation

cellular polyamine levels are regulated by a balance between
biosynthesis, interconversion, catabolism, and cellular uptake
of the amines. the major substrates in polyamine biosynthesis
are the amino acids methionine and l-arginine, which are used
to produce three polyamines, putrescine (1, 4-butane diamine),
spermidine (n-(3-(aminopropyl)-1, 4-butane diamine) and
 xxxd3234xxx  (n, ń- xxxd3014xxx -aminopropyl)-1, 4-butane diamine;
fig. 1). there are two rate-limiting steps in the polyamine
biosynthesis pathway (fig. 2): the production of putrescine
from ornithine, catalyzed by  xxxg1626xxx  (odc,
encoded by  xxxg1626xxx ), and the production of decarboxylated
s- xxxd3156xxx  (dcadomet), catalyzed by
s- xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx , encoded by
 xxxg152xxx ). other biosynthetic enzymes include spermidine
synthase and  xxxg2181xxx .
regulation of odc and  xxxg152xxx  occurs at multiple
levels, including transcription, translation, and protein
degradation. increased transcription of the  xxxg1626xxx  gene is tightly
associated with activation of several oncogenes including ras,
v-src, and myc, (celano et al., 1988; holtta et al., 1988; holtta
et al., 1993) and  xxxg152xxx  mrna can increase in response to insulin
(soininen et al., 1996). feedback regulation also occurs, as a
ß 2 0 1 0 w i l e y - l i s s , i n c .

decline in spermidine caused by a variety of inhibitors causes an
increase in  xxxg152xxx  mrna expression (shirahata and pegg, 1986).
polyamine levels also regulate odc and  xxxg152xxx 
translation efﬁciency (ito et al., 1990; ruan et al., 1994).
at the post-translational level, odc and  xxxg152xxx  have a
very short intracellular half-life (pajunen et al., 1988; ghoda
et al., 1989) and are present at very low abundance in quiescent
cells (pegg and mccann, 1982). in conjunction with the mrna
levels, odc protein levels also increase very rapidly in
response to treatment with a wide range of growth-promoting
stimuli (isomaa et al., 1983), and decreased polyamine levels
cause an increase in  xxxg152xxx  protein levels (persson et al.,
1989). ubiquitin-independent degradation of odc is brought
about by the odc antizyme ( xxxg1622xxx ; fig. 2), which directs odc
to 26s-proteasomal degradation (murakami et al., 1992).
 xxxg152xxx  is also targeted to the 26s proteasome, but it is
ubiquitinated and there is no obvious interaction with antizyme
(yerlikaya and stanley, 2004).comparatively little is known
about the transcriptional or translational regulation of
spermidine synthase and  xxxg2181xxx . they are
expressed constitutively (raina et al., 1976), and are regulated
predominantly by the availability of their substrates, particularly
dcadomet (pegg and mccann, 1982). however, some data have
also shown that the enzyme activities of these two synthases are
increased in response to mitogens, hormones, and during tissue
regeneration (hannonen et al., 1972; kapyaho et al., 1980;
korpela et al., 1981; cyriac et al., 2002).

terminal catabolism, providing another potential level of
regulation of the polyamine pool.  xxxg167xxx  (dao)
catalyzes the conversion of putrescine to  xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) (fig. 2), which is excreted in the urine. a physiological
relationship between odc and dao activities is postulated, as
inhibition of odc activity in rat bowel cells is accompanied by a
decrease in dao activity (d’agostino et al., 1990).
role of polyamines in proliferation and hypertrophy

the essential role of polyamines in cell growth and embryonic
development has been demonstrated in lower eukaryotes,
mammalian cell culture, and genetically modiﬁed mouse
models. polyamine content plays crucial roles in both normal
and neoplastic growth, as a shift in polyamine equilibrium can
lead to dysregulated growth.

(fig. 2). the more recently identiﬁed  xxxg2178xxx  (smo,
encoded by  xxxg2178xxx ), preferentially cleaves  xxxd3234xxx  into
spermidine (vujcic et al., 2002). acetylation of spermidine and
 xxxd3234xxx  also regulates polyamines catabolism, as acetylated
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  can be exported from the cells and
degraded. transcription and translation of the gene encoding
ssat, sat1, are increased in the presence of high levels of
polyamines (butcher et al., 2007). toxins and stress pathways
also increase the levels of ssat (casero and pegg, 1993; babbar
et al., 2006).
in addition to being converted by various enzymes to higher
or lower forms of amines, polyamines can also undergo

in eukaryotes, loss-of-function of odc in yeast causes growth
cessation, whereas deletion of the  xxxg1626xxx  gene in caenorhabditis
elegans is lethal (macrae et al., 1998), demonstrating the
important role of odc in early developmental processes in
lower organisms. in vertebrates, earlier studies examined the
effects of odc inhibitors, rather than direct genetic
modiﬁcation, on development. for example, adiﬂuoromethylornithine ( xxxd1972xxx ), a potent odc inhibitor,
inhibits dna synthesis in cultured mouse embryos at the late
blastocyst stage, indicating a critical role of polyamines at an
early stage of mouse embryonic development (zwierzchowski
et al., 1986). a more direct way to determine the essential role
of odc is by eliminating  xxxg1626xxx  function via gene targeting.
heterozygous  xxxg1626xxx  knockout mouse embryos are viable
and normal; however,  xxxg1626xxx -null mice are embryonic lethal
(pendeville et al., 2001)(table 1). the  xxxg1626xxx -null embryos are
poorly organized at e5.5, with decreased cell number, and
die thereafter. when heterozygous  xxxg1626xxx -knockout mice are

carboxylated to putrescine by odc. odc can be degraded by the protein antizyme ( xxxg1622xxx ). methionine is converted to dcadomet by  xxxg152xxx .
spermidine synthase transfers an aminopropyl moiety from dcadomet to putrescine to produce spermidine, and  xxxg2181xxx  transfers an
aminopropyl moiety to spermidine to produce  xxxd3234xxx . dao oxidizes putrescine to form the end product gaba, which can be found in the urine.
ssat, pao, and smo work together in the interconversion of higher to lower polyamines.

crossed with the em-myc model of myc-mediated
tumorigenesis, double heterozygous offspring are resistant to
lymphoma development, an effort exaggerated by treatment of
mice with  xxxd1972xxx  (nilsson et al., 2005). b-cell proliferation is
reduced in em-myc;odcþ/ heterozygous mice, and levels of the
cdk inhibitors  xxxg418xxx  and  xxxg419xxx , which are usually repressed
in myc-dependent pre-cancerous b cells, are normal. these
data demonstrate that odc mediates myc-dependent
lymphomagenesis via post-transcriptional actions on  xxxg418xxx 
and  xxxg419xxx , suggesting polyamines inﬂuence the turnover of
these proteins to regulate proliferation. these studies show
that odc is required for the production of polyamines to
regulate cell proliferation in early murine development.
analysis of transgenic mice with tissue-speciﬁc  xxxg1626xxx 
over-expression conﬁrms that odc regulates cell proliferation
in speciﬁc tissues. transgenic mice with  xxxg1626xxx  targeted to hair
follicle keratinocytes exhibit complete hair loss, transformation
of follicles to epithelial cysts in the dermis, seborrhea, and
excessive skin wrinkling. these mice are more sensitive than
their littermate controls to initiation with a single dose of
carcinogen and do not require treatment of tumor promoters
for tumor development, suggesting  xxxg1626xxx  over-expression is
sufﬁcient to promote tumor formation (o’brien et al., 1997).
consistent with the knockout study, adding  xxxd1972xxx  to drinking
water reverses the transgenic phenotype, conﬁrming
polyamines play an important role both in normal and
neoplastic growth (soler et al., 1996). transgenic mice with
cardiac-speciﬁc over-expression of  xxxg1626xxx  have a 5,000-fold
increase in odc activity in the heart, a 50-fold increase in
putrescine and a four-fold increase in spermidine. cardiac
transgenic mice do not develop baseline myocardial
hypertrophy, but following treatment with the b-adrenergic
agonist  xxxd2401xxx , a known inducer of muscle hypertrophy,
transgenic mice have greater myocardial hypertrophy than
controls (shantz et al., 2001; table 2). while the association
between increased odc content and cardiac hypertrophy has
previously been shown (bartolome et al., 1980), this study
further strengthens the hypothesis that polyamine
accumulation contributes to the hypertrophic response in the
heart, although the mechanism of this action remains unclear.

loss of  xxxg152xxx  function has similar effects on
developmental growth to loss of odc. in yeast, inhibition
of  xxxg152xxx  by the anti-leukemic agent methylglyoxal
bis(guanylhydrazone) (mgbg) stops growth and this is
overcome by the addition of spermidine (diala et al., 1980).
however, because mgbg can also inhibit intestinal dao, this
inhibitor has been replaced by more speciﬁc diethylglyoxal

bis(guanylhydrazone) (degbg) in later studies (pegg and
jacobs, 1983). in mouse l1210 leukemia cells, degbg inhibits
 xxxg152xxx  activity in exponentially growing cells and
decreases cell proliferation, by reducing spermidine and
 xxxd3234xxx  levels (svensson et al., 1993). in vivo, heterozygous
 xxxg152xxx -knockout embryos are viable, but  xxxg152xxx -null embryos
cannot survive to gastrulation and die after implantation
(table 3).  xxxg152xxx -null blastocysts isolated at e3.5 and individually
cultured in vitro only survive in the presence of spermidine
(nishimura et al., 2002), further supporting the hypothesis that
normal polyamine homeostasis is essential for early cell
development.
mice with cardiac-speciﬁc over-expression of  xxxg152xxx  also
have a normal life span and do not show an obvious cardiac
phenotype (nisenberg et al., 2006). at 3-weeks of age,
transgenic mice have a 200-fold increase in  xxxg152xxx  activity,
but a 50% reduction in putrescine and a 20–40% reduction in
spermidine level.  xxxd3234xxx  levels are initially increased
two-fold at birth but are normal by 3 weeks, suggesting the
presence of a compensatory mechanism, which may involve
smo to convert excess  xxxd3234xxx  back to spermidine, to
prevent  xxxd3234xxx  over-accumulation. similar to mice
over-expressing  xxxg1626xxx  in the heart, treatment of amd1transgenic mice with the b-adrenergic agonist  xxxd2401xxx 
induces cardiac hypertrophy compared to non-transgenic
controls.  xxxd2401xxx -treated transgenic mice have increased
mortality at 3–4 days of treatment but echocardiography shows
no evidence of cardiac failure, suggesting the cause of death is
not a result of cardiac hypertrophy. as  xxxd3234xxx  overaccumulation is associated with kir channel blockage (phillips
and nichols, 2003), it is possible that  xxxd2401xxx  treatment
causes a transient increase in  xxxd3234xxx , which could alter the
currents through kir ion channels and cause fatal arrhythmias
(nisenberg et al., 2006).

mammalian systems. in yeast, a null mutation of spermidine
synthase stops growth, which can be restored when spermidine
is added (hamasaki-katagiri et al., 1997). in sv3t3 mouse
ﬁbroblasts, inhibition of spermidine synthase reduces cell
growth, which can also be reversed by addition of spermidine
(pegg et al., 1982). however, in adult rats, inhibition of
spermidine synthase is not lethal, causing only a decrease in
spermidine content in some tissues, with a compensatory
increase in spermidine levels (shirahata et al., 1993). transgenic
mice over-expressing the human spermidine synthase gene
globally display increased spermidine synthase activity without
changing putrescine, spermidine, or  xxxd3234xxx  levels
(kauppinen et al., 1993). combined over-expression of
 xxxg1626xxx  and spermidine synthase increases the molar ratio of
spermidine to  xxxd3234xxx , but mice have no obvious phenotype.
this may be because  xxxg152xxx  compensates for the increase
in spermidine synthase to maintain the pools of spermidine and
 xxxd3234xxx . however, this remains speculative as no change in
 xxxg152xxx  activity was observed in the double transgenic
mice, and  xxxg152xxx  mrna levels were not measured (kauppinen
et al., 1993).

in contrast to sat1-null mice, global sat1-transgenic mice are
lean and hairless (jell et al., 2007). transgenic mice have
increased tissue and urinary acetylated polyamines, and a
compensatory increase in odc and  xxxg152xxx  activity,
increased putrescine, but no overall depletion of polyamine
pools. the increased acetylation leads to depletion of the
acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa pools in white adipose tissue,
altering glucose metabolism and causing the decrease in body
fat (jell et al., 2007). in another study, double transgenic
mice with global over-expression of sat1 and genetic
predisposition to develop prostate cancer (tumor growth in
prostate cancer predisposition; tramp), have a reduction in
genitourinary (gu) weight (fig. 3) and prostate tumor grade
(kee et al., 2004), indicating high levels of ssat suppress tumor
outgrowth in the tramp model. these double transgenic mice
also have a compensatory increase in odc and  xxxg152xxx 
activity in prostate, increased acetylated spermidine and
increased metabolic ﬂux. the latter is proposed to have an
anti-proliferative effect, perhaps due to the reduction in
acetyl-coa pools altering chromatin structure and gene
expression (kee et al., 2004).

 xxxg2181xxx 

polyamines and skeletal muscle

studies on  xxxg2181xxx  suggest that  xxxd3234xxx  is only
essential for the development of speciﬁc tissues in mammals.
yeast mutants with disruption of the  xxxg2181xxx  gene,
resulting in  xxxd3234xxx  deﬁciency, have normal growth
(hamasaki-katagiri et al., 1998). likewise, sv3t3 mouse
ﬁbroblasts grow normally in the presence of a  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase inhibitor (pegg and coward, 1985). similarly, targeted
deletion of  xxxg2181xxx  does not affect the proliferation of
mouse es cells (korhonen et al., 2001), although  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase knockout mice have not been developed from these
cells. however, despite these ﬁndings,  xxxd3234xxx  is required for
normal mouse development in vivo. male gy mice with an x
chromosome deletion that includes  xxxg2181xxx ,  xxxg1738xxx  and
at least one additional gene, have undetectable  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase activity and are only viable on a b6c3h background
(lorenz et al., 1998). affected mice have hypophosphatemia,
impaired mineralization, growth retardation, inner ear
abnormalities, hyperactivity, and circling behavior (lyon et al.,
1986; lorenz et al., 1998). all of these abnormalities apart from
the hypophosphatemia, which is caused by deletion of the  xxxg1738xxx 
gene, are rescued when  xxxg2181xxx  activity is restored
(wang et al., 2004). these results demonstrate the importance
of  xxxd3234xxx  in normal development of the ear and the
neurological system, although its speciﬁc roles remain to be
elucidated. transgenic mice with global over-expression of
 xxxg2181xxx  have normal growth and fertility (ikeguchi
et al., 2004). despite the large increase in  xxxg2181xxx 
activity in many tissues, mice have only a moderate increase in
 xxxd3234xxx  content, and decreased spermidine levels in some
tissues. this suggests that the increase in  xxxg2181xxx 
activity is compensated by alterations in  xxxg152xxx  activity, as
may occur in the spermidine synthase transgenic mice, and
excess  xxxd3234xxx  may also be degraded or excreted.

given the role of polyamines in pre- and post-natal
development in many tissues, some studies have investigated
the levels of polyamines in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and
atrophy. although there is a strong association between
polyamine levels and muscle mass, the potential mechanism via
which polyamines may regulate muscle growth are still unclear.
muscle hypertrophy

skeletal muscle hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in
muscle mass and strength. two studies have demonstrated that
stimuli-induced muscle hypertrophy is associated with
increased polyamine levels. turchanowa et al. (2000) showed
that resistance and endurance exercise in rats increases odc
and  xxxg152xxx  activities in both fast-twitch extensor
digitorum longus (edl) and slow-twitch soleus muscles.

spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx -n1-acetyltransferase

targeted disruption of the gene encoding ssat, sat1, does
not affect cell proliferation or polyamine pools in mouse es
cells, which may be due to the fact that ssat levels are low in
es cells (niiranen et al., 2002). similarly, despite the fact that
sat1-knockout mice have decreased acetyltransferase activity
and no acetylated polyamines, total polyamine pools are
relatively normal (jell et al., 2007). due to the absence of
polyamine acetylation, cellular acetyl-coa pools are increased
in white adipose tissues, leading to an increase in fat mass.
however, sat1gene deletion does not alter growth and viability.

polyamines in skeletal muscle

putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  concentrations in both
muscles are also signiﬁcantly increased.
the second study showed that the combination of aerobic
training with repeated doses of salbutamol, a b-adrenergic
agonist, signiﬁcantly increases gastrocnemius muscle mass in
rats (cepero et al., 1998; table 4). this is associated with a
dose-dependent increase in skeletal muscle and plasma
putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx , which are abolished by
co-administration of the b-adrenergic antagonist propranolol.
the strong correlation between polyamine accumulation and
muscle mass is suggestive that polyamines are involved in
muscle hypertrophy.
muscle regeneration

the association between polyamines and muscle regeneration
is demonstrated by surgical manipulation of animals. tenotomy,
cutting of the tendon, causes muscle ﬁber central lesions and a
transient elevation in putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx 
levels in adult rat soleus and gastrocnemius muscles (kaminska
et al., 1982). both the lesions and increased polyamines are
normalized 3 weeks after tenotomy, suggesting an initial
increase in polyamine level may be required and sufﬁcient for
muscle ﬁber regeneration. similarly, denervation also increases
the concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  in
rat soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, even 8 weeks after
surgery (kaminska et al., 1982). since it has previously been
shown that increases in spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  are
associated with dna synthesis (fuller et al., 1977), the authors
concluded that this elevation in polyamine levels may reﬂect the
stimulation of dna synthesis and cell proliferation occurring in
the denervated muscles (kaminska et al., 1982). this ﬁnding is in
concordance with a study performed on neonatal rat
gastrocnemius muscle, which was denervated 6 h after birth
(kaminska et al., 1981b). early denervation maintains rat
muscles at their early post-natal state, where cells are
predominantly immature and undifferentiated, with a
continuous elevation in polyamine content out to 8 weeks postdenervation (boethius, 1971). this suggests that denervated
muscle cells have been maintained as myoblasts to prolong
proliferation in order to restore muscle mass loss,
demonstrating the critical role of polyamine accumulation in
restoring muscle mass following injury.
muscle atrophy

polyamines have been studied in a number of models of muscle
atrophy. one example is the effect of phytohaemaglutinin
(pha), the lectin component of raw kidney bean, which causes a
reduction in the mass of mixed-ﬁber gastrocnemius and fasttwitch plantaris muscles, when fed to rats (bardocz et al., 1992).
these muscles have a signiﬁcant decrease in protein content
and synthesis rate, and decreased levels of putrescine,

spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx . treatment with b-agonist
clenbuterol protects the gastrocnemius muscle against phainduced atrophy by partially restoring the protein content and
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels.
muscle atrophy can also be caused by unloading, which is
modeled by rat hind-limb suspension. one study reported that
the mass of rat soleus, plantaris and edl muscles is signiﬁcantly
reduced during unloading (von deutsch et al., 2003). this is
associated with a reduction in spermidine concentrations in the
slow-twitch soleus, and an increase in spermidine levels in the
fast-twitch edl (von deutsch et al., 2003). a similar study also
showed that unloading reduces polyamine levels in slow-twitch
adductor longus muscle but increases polyamine levels in edl
muscle (abukhalaf et al., 2002). results from both studies
suggest that there is a direct relationship between polyamine
levels and muscle mass in slow-twitch muscles.
muscle atrophy caused by neuromuscular diseases can also
be accompanied by changes in polyamine content. in normal
men without evidence of neuromuscular diseases, polyamine
levels and the spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  ratio are low. polyamine
levels are elevated in muscle from patients with duchenne
muscular dystrophy, in which the skeletal muscle is
characterized by muscle ﬁber atrophy and hypertrophy,
concurrent degeneration and regeneration, and connective
tissue proliferation (kaminska et al., 1981a). limb girdle
dystrophies patients, who have enlarged and split muscles ﬁbers
with widespread regeneration and degeneration (kaminska
et al., 1981a), also have higher levels of polyamines in skeletal
muscle (rudman et al., 1980; kaminska et al., 1981a). likewise,
in mouse and hamster model of muscle dystrophy, levels of all
three polyamines are higher than controls in muscle (rudman
et al., 1980). the correlation between polyamine levels and
muscles ﬁbers undergoing degeneration and regeneration is
suggestive of a role of polyamines in these processes.
regulation of polyamines by androgens

androgens are steroid hormones that are required for male
sexual differentiation during development, and the maintenance
of sexual function and fertility in adults (wu, 1997). androgens
mediate their effects in target cells via interacting with the
 xxxg183xxx  (ar). the ligand-bound ar regulates target
gene expression, via binding to speciﬁc androgen response
elements (are) (maclean et al., 1997). there is evidence from a
number of tissues that androgens regulate polyamine
biosynthesis. in male mice, orchidectomy (removal of the
testes) decreases kidney mass, renal odc activity, and levels of
putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  (goldstone et al., 1982).
testosterone supplementation restores effects of the
orchidectomy, and treatment of mice with the odc inhibitor,
 xxxd1972xxx , suppresses the testosterone-mediated stimulation of

kidney hypertrophy and polyamine synthesis (goldstone et al.,
1982). similarly, in male mice and rats, orchidectomy decreases
odc and  xxxg152xxx  activities in the ventral prostate and
seminal vesicle, and testosterone administration normalizes the
reductions (piik et al., 1977; crozat et al., 1992). the  xxxg1626xxx  gene
promoter contains a functional are, and  xxxg152xxx  is thought to
be a direct ar target gene (crozat et al., 1992). in addition, the
spermidine synthase gene is also regulated by androgens in rat
prostate and seminal vesicle (cyriac et al., 2002). in contrast to
male mice, testosterone supplementation to female mice
increases renal sat1, indicating that androgens can
simultaneously induce both polyamine biosynthetic and
degradation pathways (levillain et al., 2003).

and expression levels correlate with muscle mass (axell et al.,
2006; maclean et al., 2008; svensson et al., 2010). serial analysis
of gene expression in muscle from orchidectomized male mice
also demonstrates that  xxxg152xxx  is up-regulated by androgens
(yoshioka et al., 2006). in addition, the genes that encode
the 26s proteasome to degrade odc and  xxxg152xxx , and
antizyme and ribosomal proteins that inhibit odc are also
increased in skeletal muscle of orchidectomized male mice after
24 h of dht treatment (yoshioka et al., 2006). these results
suggest that the anabolic actions of androgens in skeletal muscle
are mediated via modulation of not only polyamine
biosynthesis, but also polyamine degradation.
genetically modiﬁed mouse models

physiological regulation of polyamines and skeletal
muscle hypertrophy by androgens

androgens are required to maintain normal skeletal
muscle mass and strength in men (mauras et al., 1998).
supraphysiological doses of testosterone increase muscle size
and strength in healthy young and elderly men (bhasin et al.,
2001, 2005). men with decreased skeletal muscle mass resulting
from aging, hypogonadism, aids, or burns, may beneﬁt from
testosterone replacement therapy to increase muscle mass
(bhasin et al., 1997; bhasin et al., 2000; hart et al., 2001; bhasin
et al., 2005). because of the association of polyamine levels and
skeletal muscle mass (discussed in regulation of polyamines
by androgens section) and the androgen responsiveness of
polyamine regulatory enzymes, this raises the potential role of
polyamines as mediators of the anabolic actions of androgens in
skeletal muscle in males.
male and female gonadectomy mouse models

one approach to identify androgen-regulated genes is to
compare gene expression between males and females. muscles
from normal male mice have higher expression of  xxxg1626xxx  and
 xxxg152xxx , than females (yoshioka et al., 2007). in contrast, female
muscles have higher expression of  xxxg1622xxx , indicating gender
differences in the modulation of gene expression. comparison
of gene expression between orchidectomized male mice and
orchidectomized male mice treated with androgens shows that
odc1and  xxxg152xxx  are regulated by androgens in muscle (fig. 4),

journal of cellular physiology

because androgens act via the ar to elicit their effects on target
cells, an androgen-receptor knockout (arko) mouse model
has been used to identify androgen actions in skeletal muscle
(notini et al., 2005; maclean et al., 2008). arko male mice
have reduced hind-limb muscle mass, associated with a
decrease in fast-twitch contractile strength, and decreased
expression of  xxxg152xxx ,  xxxg1626xxx , and  xxxg2178xxx  in muscle (fig. 5). this
demonstrates these genes are regulated by the ar, and suggests
that one of the pathways via which androgens increase or
maintain muscle mass is through regulation of polyamine
biosynthesis.
a recent study has also suggested that the ar-polyamine
pathway may also be involved in mediating the anabolic actions
of growth hormone (gh) in muscle (klover et al., 2009).
the stat5a/b transcription factors are downstream of gh
signaling and are important for many functions including postnatal growth and local igf-1 production. stat5a/b-knockout
mice have decreased skeletal muscle mass and muscle ﬁber
cross-sectional area, and decreased expression of ar,  xxxg152xxx ,
 xxxg1626xxx , and  xxxg2178xxx  genes. gh supplementation partially rescues
the reduction in gene expression, suggesting the actions of
gh on skeletal muscle growth are mediated, in part, via the
induction of ar gene expression and subsequently, the
polyamine target gene expression (fig. 6).
conclusion

there is great interest in the polyamine ﬁeld, particularly
in relation to androgens and skeletal muscle growth. one
informative way to investigate the role and importance of
polyamines in skeletal muscle cell growth is the genetic

approach. currently no muscle-speciﬁc knockout or transgenic
mouse models have been generated for polyamine regulatory
genes. these mouse models would be extremely useful to
determine the mechanisms of polyamine-induced muscle
growth, and to deﬁne their role requirement in mediating the
anabolic actions of androgens in muscle. current data suggest
that further research in the regulation of polyamine metabolism
in skeletal muscle is worth pursuing.
