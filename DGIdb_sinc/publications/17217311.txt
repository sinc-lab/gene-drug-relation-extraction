abstract: to facilitate the delivery of nucleotide-based therapeutics to cells and tissues, a variety of
pronucleotide approaches have been developed. our laboratory and others have demonstrated that
nucleoside phosphoramidates can be activated intracellularly to the corresponding 5′-monophosphate
nucleotide and that histidine triad nucleotide binding proteins (hints) are potentially responsible for their
bioactivation. hints are conserved and ubiquitous enzymes that hydrolyze phosphoramidate bonds
between nucleoside 5′-monophosphate and an amine leaving group. on the basis of the ability of
nucleosides to quench the fluorescence of covalently linked amines containing indole, a sensitive, continuous fluorescence-based assay was developed. a series of substrates linking the naturally fluorogenic
indole derivatives to nucleoside 5′-monophosphates were synthesized, and their steady state kinetic
parameters of hydrolysis by human  xxxg1050xxx  and escherichia coli hint were evaluated. to characterize the
elemental and stereochemical effect on the reaction, two p-diastereoisomers of adenosine or guanosine
phosphoramidothioates were synthesized and studied to reveal a 15-200-fold decrease in the specificity
constant (kcat/km) when the phosphoryl oxygen is replaced with sulfur. while a stereochemical preference
was not observed for e. coli hint, hhint1 exhibited  xxxd3426xxx -fold preference for  xxxd1794xxx  phosphoramidates over l-isomers. the most efficient substrates evaluated to date are those that contain the less
sterically hindering amine leaving group, tryptamine, with kcat and km values comparable to those found
for  xxxg79xxx . the apparent second-order rate constants (kcat/km) for adenosine tryptamine
phosphoramidate monoester were found to be 107 m-1 s-1 for hhint1 and 106 m-1 s-1 for e. coli hint.
both the human and e. coli enzymes preferred purine over pyrimidine analogues. consistent with observed
hydrogen bonding between the 2′-oh group of  xxxd81xxx  and the active site residue,
asp43, the second-order rate constant (kcat/km) for thymidine tryptamine phosphoramidate was found to
be 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than that for uridine tryptamine phosphoramidate for hhint1 and 2
orders of magnitude smaller than that for e. coli hint. ara-a tryptamine phosphoramidate was, however,
shown to be a good substrate with a specificity constant (kcat/km) only 10-fold lower than the value for
adenosine tryptamine phosphoramidate. consequently, nucleoside phosphoramidates containing unhindered primary amines and either an r or beta 2′-oh group should be easily bioactivated by hints with
efficiencies rivaling those for the 5′-monophosphorylation of nucleosides by nucleoside kinases. the
differential substrate specificity observed for human and e. coli enzymes represents a potential therapeutic
rationale for the development of selective antibiotic phosphoramidate pronucleotides.

as both antiviral and anticancer drugs. unfortunately, because
they typically must be converted by intracellular kinases to
the corresponding 5′-mono-, di-, and triphosphate, the utility
of a given nucleoside will depend on the substrate specificity
of these intracellular enzymes. since in general the substrate
requirements for nucleoside kinases are more demanding than
for either nucleotidylate or diphosphosphate kinases, a
method of delivering nucleoside 5′-monophosphates would
expand the number of potentially therapeutically useful
nucleosides. to address this issue, a number of imaginative
pronucleotide approaches have been developed.1 in general,

phosphoramidate pronucleotides
these methods rely on either remote chemical or enzymatic
activation of the masking moiety, followed by collapse of
an unstable intermediate and release of the nucleotide. early
efforts to design phosphate ester pronucleotides were limited
in their success. our laboratory and others have sought to
utilize phosphoramidate esters as possible pronucleotides.2-8
recently, direct intracellular p-n bond cleavage has been
observed by esi-ms for azt l-tryptophan phosphoramidate
monoesters.9 moreover, we have demonstrated that human
and bacterial variants of a subfamily of the histidine triad
(hit) protein superfamily are nucleoside phosphoramidases.10
hit enzymes are a ubiquitous superfamily consisting
primarily of nucleoside phosphoramidases, dinucleotide
hydrolyases, and nucleotidylyl transferases.11 the distinguishing feature of these enzymes is an active site motif

composed of the sequence his-x-his-x-his-xx, where x
is a hydrophobic residue. three primary hit families have
been identified. the first and most ancient is the family of
the histidine triad nucleotide binding protein (hint). hint
homologues isolated from rabbits,12 humans,10 chickens,13
yeast,12 and escherichia coli10 have been shown to be purine
nucleoside phosphoramidases. mammalian  xxxg1050xxx  has been
suggested to have tumor suppressor activity in a hint1knockout mice model14,15 and human non-small cell lung
carcinoma cells.16 related to this observation, the expression
of hhint1 has been shown to be a potential regulator of
apoptosis.17 nevertheless, the cellular function and biochemical relevance of the phosphoramidase activity have remained
a mystery. two less typical members of the hint family are
aprataxin, which is mutated in ataxia-oculomotor apraxia1,18,19 and the scavenger  xxxg613xxx , dcps/
 xxxg613xxx , a 7-methyl gpppg hydrolyase.20,21 the second family
is that of the  xxxg797xxx  ( xxxg797xxx ), which exhibits
characteristic diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolase activity

and was reported to possess tumor suppressor activity.22 the
third family contains relatives of galactose-1-phosphate
uridylyltransferase (galt), which is a specific nucleoside
monophosphate transferase.23
the reaction mechanism of the hint protein family has
been proposed to be a two-step double replacement, in which
the complex of a phosphoramidate with his112 of hhint1
or his101 of e. coli hint forms a covalent hint-nmp
intermediate (n is a or g) followed by dissociation of the
amine. in the second step, the hint-nmp intermediate
undergoes hydrolysis to release nmp and hint. the mechanism is inspired by the similarities of hint proteins to fhit24
and galt.25 recently, human  xxxg797xxx  has been shown to possess
phosphoramidase activity with adenosine 5′-phosphoimidazolide (amp-im) and adenosine 5′-phospho-n-methylimidazolide (amp-n-meim) as substrates with similar catalytic
efficiencies in comparison with its best substrate p1-5′-oadenosine-p3-5′-o- xxxd83xxx  (ap3a).24,26 the
only reported spectroscopic substrate of hint, adenosine 5′o-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate (amp-pna), has relatively
poor michaelis-menten parameters (kcat ) 0.00187 s-1, km
) 134, and kcat/km ) 14 s-1 m-1).27 other reported methods
for detecting hint-catalyzed reaction are either a complicated coupled assay that can detect only formation of
amp24 or a discontinuous and labor-intensive hplc or tlc
assay.12,27
in this study, we report the development of a continuous
fluorescence-based assay for hint phosphoramidase activity,
which we then used to map the substrate specificity for the
human and bacterial enzymes. on the basis of these results,
we propose a set of parameters for the design of hint
activatible phosphoramidate pronucleotides.

experimental procedures
general synthetic procedure for fluorogenic nucleoside 5′-phosphoramidates. nucleoside 5′-phosphoramidates
were prepared in a single-step carbodiimide-mediated coupling reaction as described previously10 with minor modification.
1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (4.5 equiv) was added to a solution of nucleoside
5′-monophosphate (1 equiv) and indole compound (5 equiv)
in h2o (ph ∼7.0, adjusted with sodium hydroxide) at room
temperature for 6 h and concentrated under reduced pressure.
the resulting solid was then purified by flash chromatography (sio2, 5:3:0.5 chcl3/meoh/h2o mixture containing
0.5% nh4oh) to give the desired products. for some
tryptamine analogues, the preparative hplc purification was
carried out using an alltech econosphere c8 column (10
mm × 250 mm) with a linear gradient elution of solvent a
(hplc-grade water) and solvent b (hplc-grade methanol)
at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. the gradient is as follows: 0%
b for 2 min, from 0 to 5% b from 2 to 12 min, and from 5
to 100% b from 12 to 16 min. the elution peak at 6-7 min
was collected to give the white solid.

continuous fluorescent phosphoramidase activity assay. stock solutions of substrates (5 mm) were prepared in
deionized water and filtered through a 0.2 µm filter.
hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate by hint proteins was
carried out in 600 µl of degassed hepes buffer [20 mm
hepes (ph 7.2) and 1 mm mgcl2] in quartz cuvettes at 25
°c. the purification of hint proteins has been described
previously.10 fluorescence measurements were taken in a
varian/cary eclipse fluorimeter with the kinetics program
equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder. the excitation
wavelength was set at 280 nm; fluorescence emission was
measured at 360 nm, and excitation and emission slits were
set  xxxd1891xxx  nm for substrate concentrations from 50 nm to 2
µm or 5 nm for substrate concentrations from 4 to 50 µm.
the fluorescence intensity was monitored for 2 min to obtain
the baseline and allow the temperature to stabilize at 25 °c,
and then enzyme was added to initiate the reaction. the
increase in fluorescence intensity was recorded for 2-30 min
on the basis of the rate of hydrolysis. the initial velocities
were obtained by converting the slope of the fluorescence
spectrum into micromolar substrate hydrolyzed per minute,
based on the fluorescence standard curves of substrate and
indole product solutions (figure 1 and tables i and ii of the
supporting information). measurements were carried out in
duplicate, and variants are given as the standard deviation.

results and discussion
continuous fluorescence assay development. since the
discovery that hints are nucleoside phosphoramidases, we
have embarked on an effort to map the substrate specificity
of these unique enzymes so that we may better understand
their native function, as well as profit from their potential
as pronucleotide bioactivators. although both hplc-based12
and nmr-based10 assays of hint phosphoramidase activity
have been developed, only two spectrophotometric assays
have been devised. a spectrophotometric assay has been
developed that relies on the release of methylcoumarinamine
from released tert-butoxycarbonyl-l-lysine methylcoumarinamide by trypsin.13 a continuous spectrophotometric assay
that depends on the ability to monitor the release of
p-nitroaniline (410 nm) after hydrolysis of adenosine 5′-o
p-nitroaniline phosphoramidate (amp-pna) by hints has
also been developed.27 while each of these spectrophotometric assays has its advantages, the low substrate specificity
(vide supra) for amp-pna and the discontinuous nature and
restriction to lysine-based phosphoramidates of the coumarinbased assay spurred us to investigate the feasibility of
developing a simple, sensitive, and efficient continuous
fluorescence assay that was also structurally flexible enough
to allow the substrate specificity of these enzymes to be
probed in greater detail.
nucleoside phosphoramidates, such as azt l-tryptophan
methyl ester phosphoramidate monoester, that incorporate
the fluorescent indole moiety have been shown to have potent
antiviral and anticancer activity.4 as can be seen in figure
1, because of intramolecular quenching, hydrolysis of the
adenosine tryptophan phosphoramidate (1) by hhint1 can
be easily observed by monitoring the increase in indole
fluorescence with time. due to the magnitude of fluorescence
quenching (>10-fold), this assay can be carried out in the

low micromolar range, while interfilter effects limited the
highest substrate concentration to 50 µm.
hint substrate specificity. from an examination of the
michaelis-menten parameters for the series of indolecontaining nucleoside phosphoramidates, a picture of the
substrate specificity for both hhint1 and echint begins to
emerge (tables 1-3). first, on the basis of kcat/km values,
when either adenosine or guanosine phosphoramidateincorporated l-tryptophan, the human enzyme preferred
substitution of the r-carboxylate with a r-carboxamide
(table 1). in contrast, echint exhibited no significant
preference for either the methyl ester, methyl amide, or amide
substitution. this discrepancy is likely due to the closeness
of a h-bond donor in the vicinity of the phosphoramidate
r-carboxylate. this apparently is not the case for echint,
since no particular preference for a substitution at the
r-carboxylate was observed. when the effect of amino acid
stereochemistry was examined, hhint1 was far more sensitive
to configurations at the r-carbon of the amino acid, preferring d- over l-tryptophan by approximately 70- and 120fold for the adenosine and guanosine phosphoramidates,
respectively (table 2). in contrast, the bacterial enzyme
exhibited no particular amino acid stereochemical preference,
thus revealing an additional difference between the active
sites that may be exploited in the development of bacterially
specific pronucleotides. the discrepancy between the enzymes was eliminated with the removal of the r-carboxylate.
tryptamine phosphoramidates of adenosine were shown to
have significantly higher kcat values and lower km values and,
therefore, kcat/km values that are 240-fold (hhint1) and 44fold (echint) greater than the values for  xxxd1794xxx 
phosphoramidates (table 2). obviously, for both enzymes,
the r-carboxylate presents a significant stereochemical
barrier to not only substrate binding but also, on the basis
of the proposed mechanism, formation of the initial adenylated enzyme.

decrease in the kcat values for both hhint1 and echint was
observed. the greater effect on kcat observed for both adenosine and guanosine substrates likely reflects the similar importance of specifically aligned active site stabilizing interactions
on both the transition state for either enzyme adenylation or
deadenylation. while the echint km values for the phosphoramidothioates increased, the hhint1 km value was
unchanged for the adenosine rp analogue (4) and the
guanosine sp analogue (9). the idiosyncratic differences

observed for these substrates and the hints may reflect subtle
discrepancies in their binding affinity and/or the rate of active
site adenylation by the two enzymes.
probing the hint base recognition site, we determined the
substrate specificity for both purine and pyrimidine phosphoramidates of tryptamine. adenosine (12) and guanosine
(15) phosphoramidates were found to have the greatest kcat/
km values for both enzymes (table 2). indeed, the hhint1
kcat/km value of 1.5 × 107 s-1 m-1 for compound 12 is 30fold greater than the value of 4.9 × 105 s-1 m-1 reported
for the hydrolysis of n--n-boc-lysine adenosine phosphoramidate by the nearly identical rabbit  xxxg1050xxx .27 the slight
preference by hhint1 and echint may be a reflection of a
somewhat tighter set of binding interactions between the
active site and n-3, as well as the ribose ring (figure 3a,b).
evidently, the predicted backbone carbonyl interaction with
2-nh2 (figure 3c) is significant, since the km, and therefore
kcat/km, for tryptamine phosphoramidate of inosine (17) is
3-fold lower than the value for tryptamine guanosine
phosphoramidate (15). neither uridine (18) nor cytidine (19)
phosphoramidates can access either of these backbone
interactions; thus, purine substrates are preferred by both
enzymes, with a uridine analogue enjoying a slight preference
over a cytidine analogue. although the crystal structure
studies demonstrated that n-7 for both adenosine and
guanosine is solvent accessible, the introduction of a benzyl
group at this position seriously compromised both the kcat
and km value and therefore the kcat/km. nevertheless,
modifications on this face are still remarkably well tolerated.
as exhibited by the crystal structure of hhint1 (figure
3), two significant hydrogen bonding interactions are made
with the ribose of either amp or gmp. the inability of either
hhint1 or echint to efficiently hydrolyze thymidine tryptamine
phosphoramidate (20) is consistent with this finding. furthermore, although we were able to demonstrate by equilibrium dialysis that the potent  xxxd3553xxx  phosphoramidate4, l-apo, is able to modestly bind to hhint1 (kd ) 1.0
+ 0.2 mm); l-apo proved neither to be an inbibitor nor a
substrate for hhint1 (chou, t.-f. and wagner, c. r.,
unpublished results). thus, phosphoramidates of dideoxynucleosides are unlikely to be substrates for hints. the
configuration of the substituents at this position is not
absolute, since the ara-a phosphoramidate (13), in which

bound ampcp (a) (pdb entry 1av5) and of the hhint1 active
site with bound amp (b) (pdb entry 1kpf; ref 31).

the 2′-oh group is in the opposite beta-configuration, is
tolerated as a substrate (table 2).
summary and concluding remarks. on the basis of
these results, a general outline of the phosphoramidase
substrate specificity requirements for hints can be delineated.
first, although there is a clear preference for purine phosphoramidates, pyrimidine-based phosphoramidates can be
considered as viable substrates. second, on the basis of
crystal structure studies and our kinetic results with phosphoramidothioates, substitutions of the phosphoramidate
oxygens are not likely to be tolerated. third, regardless of
the base, maintenance of an electrophilic or hydrogenbonding group at the ribose 2′-position is essential. phosphoramidates containing deoxy- or dideoxynucleosides, such
as d4t and azt, therefore, are not likely to be substrates
for mammalian hints.2,4,5,7 nevertheless, as the results with
ara-a demonstrate, the beta-configuration is well tolerated,
opening the door to the potential for drugs such as  xxxd2120xxx ,32,33  xxxd1722xxx ,34  xxxd1790xxx ,35,36 and the recently discovered
2′-methyl nucleosides37 to be substrates for hints. fourth,
phosphoramidates containing a primary amine with as few
as two methylene groups are significantly favored as
substrates over sterically crowded amines. the remarkable

last, although the phosphoramidase activity of hints has
only recently been discovered, it has been known for decades
that both bacterial and mammalian tissues express a  xxxd2246xxx  phosphoramidase. smith and burrow were the
first to demonstrate this activity, when they discovered that
e. coli extracts were able to efficiently hydrolyze adenosine
phosphoramidate (amp-nh2).40 shabarova and co-workers
later partially purified a phosphoramidase from rabbit and
rat liver extracts that specifically preferred to hydrolyze
phosphoramidate-containing purine bases and d-amino acids.41 the first phosphoramidase purified to homogenenity
was obtained from bacterial extracts by kumon and coworkers and shown to be a 28 kda homodimer.42 unfortunately, since they did not obtain sequence data for this
protein, its identity could not be determined. consequently,
on the basis of our substrate specificity results for both
bacterial and human hints, we believe that the identity of
the phosphoramidase previously studied is eukaryotic  xxxg1050xxx 
and prokaryotic hint. nevertheless, given the inability of
hhint1 to hydrolyze l-apo or the related antiviral analog,
3′-azido-3′- xxxd3364xxx -l-tryptophan methyl amide phosphoramidate (chou, t.-f. and wagner, c. r., unpublished
results), it is highly unlikely that the phosphoramidase

by hhint1 of ara-adenosine, guanosine, and inosine as
substrates.

efficiency with which hints can convert nucleoside phosphoramidates to the 5′-monophosphates is comparable to the
values of 103-106 observed for nucleoside kinases, such as
adenosine kinases.38,39 one can envision, therefore, that the
therapeutic utility of nucleoside phosphoramidates could be
