the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  ( xxxg390xxx ) pathway is involved in crohn’s disease (cd) pathogenesis. in the patients’ circulation, soluble
 xxxg390xxx  (scd40l) levels are elevated and surface  xxxg390xxx  is increased in platelets and t cells, whereas in the intestine cd40 is
overexpressed in the microvasculature and  xxxg390xxx  in platelets and t cells. the therapeutic effects of infliximab in cd are
attributed to its systemic anti-tnf-␣ action, but because tnf-␣ modulates both cd40 and  xxxg390xxx , we investigated whether
infliximab affects the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway in the intestine. eighteen cd patients were evaluated before and after infliximab
therapy. plasma scd40l was measured by elisa and platelet and peripheral blood t cell (pbt)  xxxg390xxx  expression by flow
cytometry. microvascular cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx  expression were assessed in mucosal biopsies by immunohistochemistry and by flow
cytometry in human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (himec). cell cultures were performed in the presence and absence
of infliximab. infliximab treatment significantly reduced plasma scd40l levels and eliminated cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx  from mucosal
microvessels. in vitro infliximab prevented tnf-␣-induced cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx  expression by himec, and reduced pbt, but not
platelet, surface  xxxg390xxx  expression and scd40l release. in addition, infliximab decreased t cell-induced  xxxg2406xxx  expression in
himec by down-regulating  xxxg390xxx  in t cells and promoting t cells apoptosis. these findings point to a novel mechanism of action
of infliximab, i.e., the disruption of cd40/ xxxg390xxx -dependent cognate interactions between intestinal microvessels and t cells. thus,
in addition to neutralizing tnf-␣ and inducing t cell death, the therapeutic effects of infliximab in cd appear to be also mediated
by inhibition of vascular inflammation in the gut. the journal of immunology, 2006, 176: 2617–2624.

t

he cd40/ xxxg390xxx  ( xxxg390xxx )3 system is crucially involved
in immunity (1, 2), because cognate interactions between
cd40 and  xxxg390xxx  generate intra- and intercellular signals
that result in up-regulation of a variety of cell surface and soluble
molecules that ultimately impact on humoral and cellular immunity as well as inflammation (2, 3). cd40 and  xxxg390xxx  are overexpressed in both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd),
crohn’s disease (cd), and ulcerative colitis (4 –9). in active ibd
tissue, cd40 is up-regulated in several cell types including microvascular endothelial cells, whereas  xxxg390xxx  is overexpressed by
lamina propria t cells and platelets, and its soluble form (scd40l)
is increased in the circulation of ibd patients (7, 8, 10 –12). these
observations strongly indicate that the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway

plays a key pathogenic role in intestinal inflammation (13). the
up-regulation of cd40 in the microcirculation of ibd-involved
mucosa is of particular interest because the cd40 pathway is intimately involved in vascular inflammation. indeed, stimulation of
cd40-bearing endothelial cells triggers multiple inflammatory signals, resulting in leukocyte recruitment and amplification of tissue
injury (14, 15). we have previously reported that intestinal mucosal microvascular cd40 is biologically functional, as demonstrated
by in vitro experiments showing that cd40 engagement is able to
potently activate human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells
(himec), bringing about the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules,
and chemoattraction and adhesion of t cells (7, 8). these and other
observations make the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway a rational target for
therapeutic intervention because disrupting cd40- xxxg390xxx  interactions, either with blocking abs or antisense oligonucleotides,
could represent a novel approach to turn off intestinal inflammation. supporting this possibility are reports showing that shutting
down the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  system is very effective in dampening
inflammation in in vitro cellular systems (7–9) as well as in vivo
in animal models of experimental colitis (16 –19).
cd40 belongs to the tnfr superfamily, whereas  xxxg390xxx  is a
member of the tnf gene superfamily (3, 20 –23). during inflammation cd40 and tnf-␣ influence each other’s biological activity: cd40 ligation leads to production of tnf-␣ in various cell
types (24 –26), while tnf-␣ up-regulates expression of cd40 and
promotes cd40 downstream signaling pathways (27, 28). because
of its potent proinflammatory activity, several highly specific neutralizing abs have been developed against this molecule for therapeutic purposes (29). among these, infliximab is a chimeric mab

infliximab down-regulates the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway

highly effective in neutralizing the biological activity of tnf-␣
and is currently used for severe, steroid-refractory, or fistulizing
cd (30). although some of the potential mechanisms of action of
infliximab have been explored, it is still unclear what effects this
ab has on the multiple pathways that orchestrate chronic intestinal
inflammation (31, 32). in the present study, we investigated
whether some of infliximab’s anti-inflammatory effects are mediated through the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway, possibly by inhibiting
cd40 in the intestinal microvasculature or  xxxg390xxx  in platelets and
t cells, either in its membrane-bound or soluble (scd40l) forms.
our results show that infliximab effectively down-regulates in vivo
cd40 expression by intestinal microvessels in cd mucosa and
blocks tnf-␣-induced cd40 up-regulation by himec in vitro.
additionally, infliximab significantly reduces levels of scd40l in
the circulation of cd patients as well as  xxxg390xxx  surface expression
on t cells.

materials and methods
patient population
patients with active cd undergoing infliximab treatment for the first time
were studied. this group consisted of 18 subjects (7 males and 11 females),
with a mean age of 31.8 years (19 –50 years), and their clinical characteristics are summarized in table i. a group consisting of 36 healthy subjects,
matched for age and sex with the cd patients, was studied as control. the
diagnosis of cd was confirmed by clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and
histological criteria, and clinical activity was measured by the cd activity
index (cdai) (33). blood samples and mucosal biopsies were collected in
cd patients before and 2– 4 wk after completing infliximab therapy. in
addition, intestinal tissues were obtained from patients admitted for bowel
resection due to malignant and nonmalignant conditions, including colon
cancer, benign polyps, and diverticulosis. this study was approved by the
institutional review board of the catholic university (rome, italy) and
hospital clinic (barcelona, spain).

evaluation of cd40 expression in ibd and control mucosa
immunohistochemical staining for cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx  was performed as
previously reported (8). for identification of cd40-positive endothelial
cells in intestinal tissues, paraffin-embedded sections of histologically normal and cd-involved colonic mucosa were obtained before and after infliximab therapy, cut at 3-␮m thickness, deparaffinized, hydrated, blocked
for endogenous peroxidase using 3% h2o2/h2o, and subsequently subjected to microwave epitope enhancement using a dako target retrieval solution (dakocytomation). incubation with the primary cd40 polyclonal ab
(santa cruz biotechnology) and  xxxg2406xxx  (r&d systems) was conducted at
1/200 and 1/100 dilution, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature.
detection was achieved using a standard streptavidin-biotin system (vector
laboratories), and ag localization was visualized with 3⬘-3-diaminobenzidine
(vector laboratories). staining intensity was scored blindly from 1 (absent) to
4 (strong).

isolation of mucosal microvascular endothelial cells, platelets,
and peripheral blood t cells (pbt)
surgical specimens used for isolation of himec were all of colonic origin.
mucosal strips were obtained from surgically resected tissue and processed
as previously described (7). briefly, processing consisted of enzymatic digestion followed by gentle compression to extrude endothelial cell clumps,
which adhered to fibronectin-coated plates and were subsequently cultured
in mcdb131 medium supplemented with 20% fbs, antibiotics, heparin,
and  xxxg786xxx . cultures of himec were maintained at
37°c in 5% co2, fed twice a week, and split at confluence. himec were
used between passages 3 and 10.
platelets were isolated using an established consensus protocol that prevents stasis and activation, as previously reported (7). briefly, peripheral
venous blood samples were collected without tourniquet using 10% sodium
citrate as anticoagulant and transferred into polypropylene tubes. plateletrich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 180 ⫻ g for 8 min at room
temperature. platelets were isolated by centrifugation (1200 ⫻ g for 2 min),
washed, and resuspended in tyrode-hepes buffer (10 mmol/l hepes, 12
mmol/l nahco3, 137 mmol/l nacl, 2.7 mmol/l kcl, and 5 mmol/l
glucose, ph 7.4). the resulting platelet population was essentially free
(⬍0.1%) of erythrocytes and peripheral mononuclear cells and ⬎99% pure
as assessed by flow cytometry for expression of the platelet-specific ag

cd42b. to ensure that the isolation procedure did not artificially stimulate
the platelets, their activation state was assessed before and after isolation
by measuring  xxxg2049xxx  expression levels in whole blood and purified
platelets by flow cytometry. peripheral blood t cells (pbt) were isolated
by negative selection as previously described (10).

flow cytometric studies for detection of cell surface molecules
and apoptosis
for cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx  expression by himec, endothelial cells were
plated on fibronectin-coated wells of a 24-well cluster plate at a density of
5 ⫻ 104/ml/well. confluent monolayers were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 100 u/ml (equivalent to 1 ng/ml) of tnf-␣, 4 ␮g/ml scd40l, or
100 u/ml il-1␤ (r&d systems) in the presence and absence of therapeutic
levels (5 ␮g/ml) of infliximab (34, 35). in some experiments, increasing
doses of tnf-␣ or infliximab were used, and himec were stained at days
0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. in other experiments, himec were cultured for 24 h with
tnf-␣, washed, and infliximab was added to the monolayers for an additional period of 24 h. at the end of the culture, himec were washed five
times in cold pbs, and a single-cell suspension was obtained using a detaching buffer (pbs, 20 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 10 mm edta, and 0.5%
bsa), followed by vigorous pipetting. after additional washing, himec
were incubated with fitc-conjugated anti-cd40 or fitc-conjugated antivcam-1, or the appropriate isotype control ab (bd pharmingen), for 30
min at 4°c, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry
as previously described (7).
the expression of  xxxg390xxx  on the platelet surface was assessed before
and after activation with 0.5 u/ml thrombin (sigma-aldrich), in the presence and absence of infliximab, for 15 min at room temperature. platelets
were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and incubated with abs against
 xxxg390xxx  (fitc-conjugated-anti- xxxg390xxx ; bd biosciences), or cd42b
(santa cruz biotechnology), for 30 min at room temperature. pbt were
analyzed before and after a 24-h stimulation with polystyrene beads coated
with murine mabs to human cd3 and cd28 (dynal), in the presence or
absence of infliximab, and stained for  xxxg390xxx  as described elsewhere (36).
in some experiments, pbt were stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide and analyzed for dna content (37).
in some experiments,  xxxd2676xxx /cd28-activated pbt were incubated
with himec in the presence or absence of infliximab or 10 ␮g/ml anticd40l blocking ab (m90; immunex) for 24 h at the ratio 1:20 as previously reported (8). parallel cocultures were conducted in tissue culture
wells and in a transwell system (3-␮m pore size). at the end of the coculture, himec were extensively washed to remove all pbt and then
stained with fitc-conjugated anti- xxxg2406xxx  as described above.
samples were analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry using a coulter
epics xl flow cytometer (beckman coulter), and each analysis was performed on at least 10,000 events. quantification of cd40 and  xxxg390xxx 
expression was obtained using the winlist software program (verity software house).

quantification of scd40l in plasma and culture supernatants
whole peripheral blood was collected into edta-containing tubes, immediately centrifuged at 1000 ⫻ g at 4°c, and plasma was stored at ⫺70°c
(10). platelets and pbt were isolated from normal control and cd subjects.
freshly isolated platelets were cultured in tyrode-hepes buffer alone or
in the presence of thrombin, whereas pbt were cultured in serum-free
rpmi 1640 alone or stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx /cd28. parallel cultures
were conducted in the presence of infliximab as described above for the
cd40 flow cytometric analysis. after 24 h, supernatants were harvested by
centrifugation at 800 ⫻ g for 5 min at 4°c and stored at ⫺70°c. plasma
and supernatants were thawed once and analyzed for scd40l content in
duplicate using a commercially available elisa kit with an assay reproducibility of ⬎95% (r&d systems).

such increase could be inhibited by tnf-␣ blockade, mucosal biopsies were obtained before and after (2– 4 wk) infliximab administration to a group of 18 patients with active cd. indications for
infliximab therapy included severe, steroid-resistant or -dependent,
fistulizing, or chronically active disease in which standard immunosuppressive therapy had previously failed. patients’ clinical
characteristics are summarized in table i. as shown in fig. 1,

seven cd and five healthy control subjects.

intestinal mucosal microvessels display abundant surface cd40
expression in the inflamed mucosa ( panels 1 and 4). notably, in
biopsies taken from the original biopsy sites of the same patients,
cd40 expression was strikingly reduced after infliximab treatment, reaching a level similar to that seen in the normal mucosa of
control subjects (fig. 1, panels 2, 3, and 5).  xxxg2406xxx  expression
was also detected in the intestinal microvasculature of cd patients
(fig. 1, panel 7), but disappeared after infliximab treatment (fig. 1,
panel 8). semiquantitative scores revealed a significant reduction
of both cd40 ( p ⬍ 0.001) and  xxxg2406xxx  ( p ⬍ 0.05) expression by
intestinal microvessels of cd patients after comparison to conditions before infliximab therapy (data not shown). because these
results suggest that tnf-␣ blockade is responsible for cd40
down-regulation in vivo, we directly evaluated the modulatory effect of infliximab on himec cd40 expression in vitro by flow
cytometry. as shown in fig. 2, the low spontaneous cd40 expression on himec was strongly up-regulated by tnf-␣ treatment in
a dose-dependent manner, reaching peak expression at 3 days and
returning to baseline levels by 7 days. when the same experiments
were conducted in the presence of infliximab, up-regulation of
cd40 was inhibited in a dose-dependent way (fig. 2). comparable
results following similar time and dose kinetics were observed
with regard to  xxxg2406xxx  induction and blockade (fig. 2b). that
such effect was specifically dependent on tnf-␣ blockade was
demonstrated by the lack of effect of infliximab in preventing
cd40 up-regulation induced by the proinflammatory cytokine
il-1␤ (data not shown). finally, to investigate whether infliximab
could not only prevent but also inhibit established cd40 expression, himec were first stimulated with tnf-␣ for 24 h, extensively washed, and then treated with infliximab. under these conditions, blocking tnf-␣ did not revert tnf-␣-induced cd40
expression, as seen by flow cytometric analysis (data not shown).

1–7 days, then suspended, washed, and stained for cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx ,
and analyzed by flow cytometry. cells used for the time-response curve
were exposed to 100 u/ml tnf-␣; cells used for the tnf-␣ and infliximab
dose-response curves were analyzed at 24 h. each curve shows data from
four separate experiments with four different himec lines.

in vitro, we next investigated whether infliximab could also inhibit
the expression and secretion of  xxxg390xxx , the cd40 counterreceptor.
circulating scd40l levels were measured in the plasma of cd
patients before and after infliximab treatment, as well as in normal
controls. as shown in fig. 4, plasma levels of scd40l were dramatically ( p ⬍ 0.001) higher in cd patients (11,900 ⫾ 1,730
pg/ml) than in normal controls (110 ⫾ 32 pg/ml), but they were
significantly ( p ⬍ 0.001) reduced after infliximab therapy
(5,770 ⫾ 1,120 pg/ml). in all patients, both the cdai and scd40l
levels decreased after infliximab therapy, but without a significant
correlation (r ⫽ 0.28) between the two parameters.

tnf-␣ blockade inhibits  xxxg2406xxx  expression by himec
during gut inflammation, several adhesion molecules are overexpressed on microvascular endothelial cells,  xxxg2406xxx  being one of
the most prominent (38). because tnf-␣ blockade inhibited
himec cd40 expression, we investigated whether this inhibitory
action was also observed with regard to  xxxg2406xxx . at baseline,
himec expressed  xxxg2406xxx  at negligibly low levels (fig. 3), but
when cells were exposed to tnf-␣,  xxxg2406xxx  expression increased remarkably ( p ⬍ 0.01), and infliximab was able to return
this expression to baseline levels (fig. 3). scd40l was also able to
up-regulate  xxxg2406xxx , but the combination of scd40l plus tnf-␣
increased  xxxg2406xxx  expression to levels higher than tnf-␣ alone
(fig. 3), and exposure to infliximab significantly ( p ⬍ 0.05) decreased  xxxg2406xxx  expression to the levels induced by scd40l
alone. however, infliximab failed to modulate the  xxxg2406xxx  expression induced by scd40l.

exclusive source of circulating scd40l in cd patients (10). because infliximab treatment decreases circulating levels of scd40l
in these patients (fig. 4), we investigated whether tnf-␣ blockade
hindered the shedding of this molecule from t cells, platelets, or
both. all platelets and t cells per unit of blood were isolated, and
 xxxg390xxx  surface expression and secretion were assessed in resting
cells and cells activated by thrombin or  xxxd2676xxx /cd28, respectively, in the presence and absence of infliximab. as shown in fig.
5, platelet  xxxg390xxx  expression was cryptic. after thrombin stimulation, a high number of platelets expressed  xxxg390xxx , and this increase was not prevented by infliximab. few resting pbt expressed surface  xxxg390xxx  but, like platelets, their number increased
substantially after  xxxd2676xxx /cd28 activation. in marked contrast
to platelets, tnf-␣ blockade resulted in a major reduction of the
number of  xxxg390xxx -positive pbt. to test whether infliximab could
also have an inhibitory effect on scd40l release (39, 40), we
measured the concentration of scd40l in the supernatants of cultures containing autologous platelets and pbt from normal control
subjects. as shown in fig. 6a, in the absence of stimulation, platelets were virtually the only source of scd40l, but this situation
was drastically reverted upon activation, when pbt became the
dominant source of scd40l. secretion of scd40l by platelets
was unaffected by infliximab, whereas that of pbt was significantly ( p ⬍ 0.05) reduced by tnf-␣ blockade. when pbt from
normal control and cd subjects were compared, secretion of
scd40l was significantly greater in unstimulated as well as activated cultures of cd compared with normal control cells (fig. 6b).
infliximab treatment significantly ( p ⬍ 0.01) reduced production
of scd40l by both normal control and cd pbt compared with
untreated activated cells (fig. 6b).
infliximab decreases t cell-dependent himec  xxxg2406xxx 
expression by down-regulating t cell  xxxg390xxx  and promoting t
cells apoptosis
the above results demonstrate that infliximab is very effective in
inhibiting the expression of membrane-bound  xxxg390xxx  and release
of scd40l by pbt (figs. 5 and 6). because activated t cells
express  xxxg390xxx  and they can enhance endothelial  xxxg2406xxx 
through the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway (8, 13), we finally investigated
whether infliximab could affect this mechanism of endothelial cell
activation. adding infliximab to cocultures of himec and anticd3/cd28-activated pbt significantly ( p ⬍ 0.05) reduced
 xxxg2406xxx  expression (fig. 7a). the dependence of  xxxg2406xxx  induction on contact with cd40-positive t cells was confirmed by

blockade (fig. 7a) and the failure to induce  xxxg2406xxx  expression
when activated pbt were separated from himec in a transwell
system (data not shown). infliximab has also been reported to induce
apoptosis of activated t cells, an effect believed to be of central importance in reducing mucosal inflammation in cd (29, 34, 41, 42).
we confirmed this observation by assessing apoptosis of pbt in unstimulated and  xxxd2676xxx /cd28-activated cells. unstimulated pbt
displayed low levels of spontaneous apoptosis that increased only
modestly after  xxxd2676xxx /cd28 stimulation (fig. 7b). however, when
infliximab was added to  xxxd2676xxx /cd28-stimulated pbt apoptosis
increased considerably (fig. 7b), but had no effect on resting cells
(data not shown).

discussion
the results of this study demonstrate that infliximab down-regulates the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  pathway in cd by acting on both components of this molecular pair. it is now established that this pathway,
in addition to playing an essential role in cellular immunity as
traditionally acknowledged, is a key component of the pathophysiology of multiple inflammatory disorders, including vascular inflammation (14, 43, 44), which is dependent on the integrated signaling pathways of cd40 and tnf-␣. this integration has been

confirmed in murine models, where inhibition of cd40 signaling
decreases inflammatory infiltrates in established atherosclerotic lesions (45) and tnf-␣ blockade reduces progression of atherosclerosis (46). a recent but growing body of evidence indicates that
vascular inflammation is also an important component of ibd
pathogenesis (47). we have previously shown that the cd40/
 xxxg390xxx  system is involved in several proinflammatory events in
ibd, including chemokine and cytokine production, cell adhesion
molecule up-regulation, chemokine mobilization on the endothelial surface, and t cell adhesion to and transmigration across endothelial monolayers (8, 10). in addition, a recent preliminary report has shown that mice in which the cd40 or  xxxg390xxx  genes have
been deleted are protected from experimental colitis, and adhesion
of leukocyte and platelets to the intestinal microvasculature is
deeply impaired in colitic animals in the absence of the cd40/
 xxxg390xxx  pathway (48).
in view of the close functional relationship between cd40 and
tnf-␣ and the established therapeutic effects of infliximab
through its anti-tnf-␣ activity, we investigated whether such beneficial effects might be mediated by inhibition of cd40/cd40ldependent vascular inflammation in the mucosa of cd patients.
supporting evidence for this possibility was initially obtained in
vivo, as we found that in patients who received infliximab treatment the expression of cd40 was essentially abolished in the mucosal microvasculature in parallel with a reduction of the inflammatory infiltrates. the same was observed with regard to  xxxg2406xxx 
expression, which disappeared with clinical and histological improvement. these observations were corroborated by our in vitro
studies demonstrating that infliximab incubation effectively and
dose-dependently prevented cd40 and  xxxg2406xxx  up-regulation on
himec. an additional effect of infliximab on himec was the
inhibition of endothelial cell activation, as quantified by a significant decreased of  xxxg2406xxx  expression. this is important because
 xxxg2406xxx  expression is physiologically absent in the normal gut
(49) but dramatically increased in active ibd, where it promotes
recruitment of leukocytes into the inflamed mucosa (38). the crucial contribution of this phenomenon to ibd has been confirmed
by a recent report showing that use of cd40 antisense oligonucleotides effectively improves experimental colitis and reduces
vascular inflammation, as measured by the reduction of  xxxg2406xxx 
expression by the mucosal microvasculature in treated animals
(19). taken together, these in vivo and in vitro data suggest that
tnf-␣ plays a crucial role in governing cd40 expression by mucosal endothelial cells in cd and that infliximab abrogates the
proinflammatory effects of tnf-␣ on these vascular cells.
the above results offer compelling evidence that infliximab acts
on the cd40 component of the cd40/ xxxg390xxx  system. we next
investigated whether tnf-␣ blockade could also act on the ligand
component of the system by measuring levels of circulating
scd40l in cd patients before and after infliximab therapy. an
elevation of plasma scd40l levels is known to be present in cd
patients (10), as we previously reported. clinical improvement, as
assessed by a major drop in cdai, was observed after infliximab
therapy, and this response was accompanied by a significant reduction of plasma scd40l concentrations. to investigate the
mechanisms responsible for such effect, we analyzed the individual contribution of each one of the two cellular sources of scd40l,
platelets and t cells. under resting conditions, platelets are practically the single source of scd40l in the peripheral circulation
because unstimulated t cells produce only minute amounts of the
ligand. however, when t cells become activated as it occurs in
several inflammatory conditions, this balance is completely reverted, because we discovered that t cells turned out to be a proportionally more abundant source of scd40l than platelets. this

the journal of immunology
is a novel observation, considering that platelets have been long
considered the major source of plasma scd40l (40, 50). this
reversal in the predominant source of scd40l is likely to be explained by the fact that platelets contain only preformed  xxxg390xxx 
and lack synthetic capacity even after stimulation, whereas activated t cells can produce massive quantities of inflammatory molecules for prolonged periods of time (51). when infliximab was
added to activated t cells, levels of scd40l were significantly
reduced, while platelet-derived scd40l remained unchanged.
translating these in vitro findings to our in vivo observations in
infliximab-treated cd patients, it is reasonable to speculate that the
clinical reduction of scd40l levels in cd patients is mainly due
to the inhibitory action of infliximab on t cells since this ab fails
to alter the amounts of scd40l shed by platelets.
among the many functional consequences of inhibiting activated t cells is the decrease in their capacity to bind to and activate
endothelial cells, especially under inflammatory conditions such as
ibd (52). therefore, we explored whether infliximab could reduce
activation of himec secondary to binding of  xxxg390xxx -positive t
cells. using  xxxg2406xxx  expression as an index of vascular activation
(38, 52), we observed that tnf-␣ blockade significantly reduced
the capacity of t cells to trigger vascular inflammation. although
leukocyte activation of endothelial cells depends on multiple factors, two are particularly important to our investigation and may
explain the observed findings. the first is the decrease in  xxxg390xxx 
expression by activated t cells exposed to infliximab as we discussed above. the second is the recognized ability of infliximab to
induce t cell apoptosis (29, 34, 41, 42), an effect we reproduced in
our experimental system and that would result in a diminished
availability of activated t cells for binding to the inflamed mucosal
microvasculature.
therefore, considering the pathogenic role of the cd40/ xxxg390xxx 
system in intestinal inflammation, one could envision a dual beneficial effect of infliximab in cd: one mediated by blocking tnf␣-dependent activation of endothelial cells and another mediated
by inhibiting mucosal microvascular inflammation dependent on
activated  xxxg390xxx -positive t cells. the therapeutic implications of
ameliorating vascular inflammation with infliximab go beyond
ibd and could be relevant to other conditions where endothelial
inflammation also plays a pathogenic role, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and atherosclerosis. moreover,
because increased levels of scd40l are considered a strong risk
factor for cardiovascular events (53, 54), and ibd patients are at an
increased risk of thromboembolic complications (55), lowering
scd40l levels with infliximab in cd patients could also decrease
their risk of scd40l-related thrombosis (11, 56).
in conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this the first report
showing an in vivo and in vitro effect of infliximab on the cd40/
 xxxg390xxx  pathway in cd. this points to a novel mechanism of action of infliximab in this condition, i.e., the amelioration of mucosal inflammation through the disruption of tnf-␣-dependent
cd40/ xxxg390xxx -mediated cognate interactions between the intestinal microcirculation and circulating t cells. this mechanism
should be added to the growing list of alternative modes of actions
of anti-tnf-␣ therapies that may better explain their immunomodulatory action besides direct neutralization of tnf-␣ and t
cell killing (57).
