there is little data on genetic predictors of loop diuretic efficacy in humans. therefore, we investigated the diuretic
effects of single oral doses of bumetanide,  xxxd2167xxx , and  xxxd3404xxx  in a crossover study in 97 healthy caucasians in
relation to genetic variation in the renal sodium transporters  xxxg2078xxx  (coded by  xxxg2078xxx ), ncc ( xxxg2080xxx ), and enac
(three subunits coded by  xxxg2031xxx ,  xxxg2032xxx , and  xxxg2034xxx ). the ncc alanine 264 allele (gly264ala) and the most frequent
 xxxg2032xxx  haplotype were associated with stronger diuresis, indicating lower reabsorbing function of these alleles. the
variant alleles of the tightly coupled polymorphisms rs5723 (leu649leu) and rs5729 in  xxxg2034xxx  were associated with
weaker diuresis, indicating higher activity. extended haplotype homozygosity implied evolutionary selection of the ncc
alanine 264 allele. in conclusion, acute diuretic effects of loop diuretics were affected by genetic variation in sodium
transporters that, in the nephron, are located distally from  xxxg2078xxx .

interindividual differences in the response to loop diuretic
drugs like resistance to diuretics or potentially life-threatening hypokalemia medically encompass most relevant problems. there is not much data on molecular genetic
determinants of such variation.
three renal sodium reuptake transporters are the primary
targets of the loop, thiazide- and potassium-sparing diuretics:
the sodium–potassium dichloride cotransporter  xxxg2078xxx , the
sodium–chloride cotransporter ncc, and the epithelial
sodium channel enac, which are located in this order in
the course of the nephron.  xxxg2078xxx  and ncc are encoded by
the genes  xxxg2078xxx  and  xxxg2080xxx . enac is composed of three
subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma, encoded by  xxxg2031xxx ,
 xxxg2032xxx , and  xxxg2034xxx . rare loss of function mutations in
these genes cause bartter’s syndrome, gitelman’s syndrome,
and pseudohypoaldosteronism, respectively, but functional
or medical effects of more common polymorphisms have
only rarely been reported.1
in ncc, gly264ala variant goes with a 50% lower sodium
translocation and increased chloride and thiazide affinity in
xenopus oocytes.2 another amino-acid substitution,
arg913gln, has been associated with primary hypertension,

renal albumin loss, and diabetic nephropathy.3–6 a c4t
polymorphism in intron 1 of the ncc-coding gene  xxxg2080xxx 
(rs13306673) has been associated with the response to
thiazide diuretics.7
in the  xxxg216xxx  of enac, ala663thr in vitro affected
enac’s surface expression8–10 and has been associated with
hypertension.11–13 another  xxxg216xxx  polymorphism,
trp493arg, may be associated with the risk of ischemic
stroke.14 in the enac  xxxg217xxx , gly442val has been
associated with greater sodium retention, lower plasma
aldosterone levels, and hypertension.11 in the gene coding
the enac  xxxg218xxx ,  xxxg2034xxx , the ga haplotype
defined by the variant alleles of rs5723 (leu649leu in exon
13) and rs5729 (in the 30 untranslated region) has been
associated with the blood pressure response to thiazide
diuretic therapy.15 a g4a polymorphism at 173 of the
 xxxg2034xxx  promoter (rs5718) has been associated with blood
pressure and pulse pressure,16 namely in overweight individuals.17
in vivo measurement of the activity of specific proteins in
unselected samples has been of great value in identifying
functionally relevant genetic polymorphisms.18,19 here, we

applied this approach of studying functional variation in an
unselected, healthy, caucasian population to identify unknown functionally relevant genetic variation in genes
encoding the three renal sodium reuptake transporters that
are the targets of loop, thiazide- and potassium-sparing
diuretics:  xxxg2078xxx , ncc, and enac.
results
study population and general results

the unselected 97 healthy male caucasian volunteers, who
participated in the clinical study, had a mean (range) age of
28 years (19–50 years). the mean body weight and height
were 78 kg (57–93 kg) and 182 cm (170–198 cm) respectively,
and the mean body surface area was 2.0 m2 (range
1.7–2.3 m2). figure 1 depicts the time courses of the excreted
fraction (fe) of sodium with bumetanide,  xxxd2167xxx , and
 xxxd3404xxx , respectively. the corresponding time courses of
the fe of volume,  xxxd2988xxx , and calcium were
comparable with a forced excretion phase lasting about 6 h
and a rebound phase lasting from 6 to 24 h after drug intake.
the investigated polymorphisms are described in table 1.
they formed one linkage disequilibrium (ld) block in
 xxxg2031xxx  and two ld blocks, each, in the other genes as
shown in figure 2. using these ld blocks, definitions
resulted in two to six frequent haplotypes per ld block; these
haplotypes are described in table 2 (haplotypes were defined
as frequent with allele frequencies above 2% in the context of
this paper).
genotype–phenotype association

genotype–phenotype associations are exemplified by the
association of the 24-h sodium excretion with the studied
polymorphisms in figure 2. the genotype–phenotype
association analysis revealed three associations with the 24 h
excretion of water or electrolytes with p-values below 0.01
(table 3). these three associations were analyzed in further
detail as later described. notably, no polymorphism or

figure 1 this figure depicts the time course of the mean sodium excretion
induced by the three loop diuretic drugs bumetanide,  xxxd2167xxx , and
 xxxd3404xxx . sodium excretion is given as a percentage of the filtered amount
of sodium (fraction excreted). note the differing scaling of abscissa and
ordinate during the forced excretion 0–6 h interval compared with the
6–24 h rebound interval.

haplotype in the  xxxg2078xxx -coding gene was strongly associated
with the diuresis phenotypes.
the ncc ( xxxg2080xxx ) polymorphism gly264ala was
significantly associated with the 24-h excretion of chloride
and potassium (table 3). carriers of the alanine allele
excreted more chloride and more potassium on intake of the
loop diuretics, comparable among the three loop diuretic
drugs (figure 3). the association was pronounced in the
6–24-h period (table 3). weaker, but parallel trends to
stronger excretion were observed with volume, sodium, and
calcium. the variant alanine allele was observed with an allele
frequency of 0.032 (table 1); it occurred in exactly one
haplotype that was defined by this variant ( xxxg2080xxx 
haplotype 1_3 in table 2).
among the  xxxg2032xxx  (enac  xxxg217xxx ) haplotypes, the
most frequent haplotype at the ld block 2 was significantly
associated with the phenotypes. carriers of the haplotype
 xxxg2032xxx  2_1 excreted comparably higher fractions of
volume, sodium, and chloride in response to loop diuretics
(table 3). direction and extent of the effect were comparable
among the three loop diuretic drugs (figure 3). the effect
was pronounced during the 6–24-h period (table 3). among
the polymorphisms forming the  xxxg2032xxx  ld block 2,
rs152728 and rs152745 were similarly associated with the
phenotypes as was  xxxg2032xxx  2_1, but the extent and the
strength of association were weaker. in the region of the
 xxxg2032xxx  ld block 2, the synonymous polymorphism
rs238547 (pro93pro) is the only validated exonic polymorphism. in the hapmap caucasian data set, pro93pro defines the
haplotype correspondent to the second most frequent
 xxxg2032xxx  haplotype 2_2 in our data set.  xxxg2032xxx  2_2 tended
to be associated with the phenotype to the opposite direction
compared with  xxxg2032xxx  2_1; however, weaker and in parallel
with  xxxg2032xxx  2_3, disqualifying pro93pro as the functional
polymorphism.
in  xxxg2034xxx  (enac  xxxg218xxx ), the variant g-allele
of rs5723, a c4g exchange resulting in the synonymous
leu649leu polymorphism, was significantly associated with
lower 24-h excretion of volume and calcium (table 3).
carriers of the variant g-allele excreted less volume and less
calcium with all three loop diuretics (figure 3). carriers of
the variant allele also weakly tended to excrete less sodium
and chloride. the extent of the haplotype–phenotype
association was pronounced during the 6–24-h period. the
polymorphism rs5723 (leu649leu) is not completely but
tightly coupled to the polymorphism rs5729 in the 30
untranslated region of  xxxg2034xxx . the variant alleles of
rs5723 and rs5729 occurred in two  xxxg2034xxx  haplotypes,
2_4 and 2_5, that were comparably associated with the
phenotypes. this suggests a common causative variant; either
the variant allele of rs5723 (leu649leu), of rs5729, or a
variant tightly coupled with them. in this study, coupling
between leu649leu and rs5729 was observed in all but two
chromosomes, resulting in indiscernible genotype–phenotype
association patterns and leaving the question unanswered as
to which polymorphism may be the functional one.

in silico analyses in the haplotype breakdown at the five
studied gene loci were performed with polymorphisms
analyzed in 120 caucasian chromosomes in the hapmap
project (www.hapmap.org).20  xxxg2080xxx  gly264ala was the
most 30 located polymorphism of a 35-kb spanning ld block.
this ld block ranged from rs1561141 in intron 15 of the
neighbored gene nup93 that encodes a 93-kda nucleoporin,
included the  xxxg2080xxx  promoter, and spanned the first part
of the  xxxg2080xxx  gene up to exon 6, where gly264ala is
located. the c-allele that defined the alanine allele defined
exactly one major haplotype with an allele frequency of 7%.
the extended haplotype length (ehl) of this haplotype well
exceeds 300 kb (figure 4) compared with a median ehl of
30 kb for haplotypes of 5–10% allele frequency in this data set
ranging from 55.0 to 56.0 mbp on chromosome 16. the

extended haplotype homozygosity (ehh) of the alanine 264coding haplotype was significantly greater than the mean

(po0.001). the relative ehh of the alanine-coding haplotype increased in relation to the other haplotypes at this ld
block to both sides of the ld block with increasing distance
as far as it could be calculated. concerning  xxxg2078xxx ,
 xxxg2031xxx , 1b, and 1g, the extended haplotype homozygosity
analysis did not provide evidence for major evolutionary
selection of a specific haplotype.
discussion

we provide evidence that the diuretic effects of loop diuretic
drugs are modulated by common genetic polymorphisms.
our findings referred to genetic variation in the sodium–chloride cotransporter ncc and the epithelial sodium
channel enac; two sodium transporters located distally to
the sodium–potassium dichloride cotransporter  xxxg2078xxx , the
primary target protein of the loop diuretics. thus, our
findings are in line with the view that despite being
quantitatively less important, the distally located reabsorption systems are of capital importance in the fine-tuning of
total body ion homeostasis. last but not least, we provide
evidence for evolutionary selection of a sodium-loosing but
calcium-sparing variant in the ncc in caucasians.
the alanine allele of the ncc ( xxxg2080xxx ) polymorphism
gly264ala was associated with higher 24-h excretion of
chloride and potassium on loop diuretic drug intake, and
weaker but comparable trends concerning volume, sodium,
and calcium excretion. these findings are consistent with a
lower function of the alanine 264 variant consistent with in
vitro observations.2 weaker sodium–chloride transport capacity implies weaker counterregulatory capacity in the context
of loop diuretic blockade of the more proximally located
 xxxg2078xxx . weaker counterregulation resulted in higher excretion of sodium and chloride, and indirectly, volume.
furthermore, this suggests that the lower intrinsic sodium–chloride transporting activity of the alanine variant is

not compensated by counterregulatory ncc overexpression
in the steady state. the higher potassium excretion in alanine
carriers may result indirectly from the higher sodium delivery
to more distal nephron parts, where enac-mediated sodium
reabsorption results in compensatory potassium excretion.
the finding that the indirect potassium effect is relatively
more pronounced compared with the direct sodium effect is
comparable to what has been observed with the angiotensinconverting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism on
hydrochlorothiazide application.21 higher calcium excretion
in carriers of the alanine 264 variant may also be an indirect
effect. in the ncc-expressing cells, the basolateral sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) provides the
primary driving force for ncc-mediated sodium–chloride
reabsorption. also, the basolateral sodium–calcium exchange
that indirectly drives luminal calcium reabsorption is
secondary to the sodium–potassium atpase activity. adaptation to permanently lower ncc activity may include lower
calcium reabsorption capacity to avoid calcium overload. in
the case of loop diuretic action, such adaptation could result
in comparably high urinary calcium excretion on sodium and
calcium overload.
recent positive evolutionary selection of the alanine
variant of the ncc polymorphism gly264ala was implied
by in silico analysis of the 120 caucasian hapmap chromosomes (figure 4). this corresponds to the fact that the
alanine variant has only been found in caucasians, not in
asians or blacks. positive selection of an ncc variant
conferring less sodium–chloride reabsorption capacity may
appear paradoxical at first glance considering the importance
of salt and salt sparing. in addition, the glycine allele has been
highly conserved in ncc as well as its analogues in  xxxg2079xxx 
and 2 and the four potassium–chloride cotransporters.2 as
outlined above, less sodium–chloride reabsorption via ncc
directly promotes calcium reabsorption. backing calcium
homeostasis in the comparably little sun-exposed caucasian
populations may be thought of as an evolutionary selection
factor. together with reduced vitamin d degradation as the
suggested driving force for the selection of a reduced
functional cyp3a4 allele,22 our finding strengthens calcium
homeostasis as a selection factor in less sun-exposed
populations.
two of three strong genotype–phenotype associations were
observed with genetic variation in genes coding for enac
subunits: (1) with  xxxg2032xxx  2_1, the most frequent haplotype
of the ld block 2 in  xxxg2032xxx , the gene that encodes enac’s
 xxxg217xxx , and (2) with two tightly coupled polymorphisms in  xxxg2034xxx ; rs5723, a c4g substitution resulting in
leu649leu in enac’s  xxxg218xxx , and rs5729, a t4a
substitution in the 30 untranslated region. enac is the most
distally located sodium-reuptake channel in the course of the
nephron. in the counterregulation of  xxxg2078xxx  blockade, lower
enac function should result in comparably high urinary
excretion of sodium and secondarily, of chloride and volume.
such an excretion pattern was observed with  xxxg2032xxx  2_1
and mirrored with lower magnitude by rs5723 (leu649leu)
306

and rs5729. in both cases, the effect on volume excretion
outweighed that on sodium and chloride excretion. in
consequence,  xxxg2032xxx  2_1 may result in comparably low
overall enac function and the variant  xxxg2034xxx  allele in a
higher functional reabsorption system. leu649leu/rs5729
should therefore predispose to hypertension susceptible to
diuretic therapy; exactly this has been reported in 585 adults
with essential hypertension.15 usually, enac mediates
sodium reabsorption in counterbalance with potassium
excretion from the same cells, but neither with  xxxg2032xxx 
2_1 nor with rs5723 (leu649leu)/rs5729 did we observe any
effect on potassium excretion. this leads to the hypothesis
that genetically altered enac function may be counteracted
to keep potassium homeostasis unaffected and that such
counterregulation also remains effective in the state of grossly
increased tubular sodium and potassium supply. urinary
calcium excretion on altered enac function, e.g., by
potassium-sparing diuretics, is dissociated from sodium
excretion. when a block of enac hyperpolarizes the luminal
membrane, calcium reabsorption via the epithelial calcium
channel ecac increases.23,24 calcium reabsorption should,
however, be regulated in parallel to chronically, e.g.,
genetically, altered enac function to keep calcium homeostasis unaffected. such parallel regulation could provide the
basis that calcium excretion is not dissociated but parallels
sodium excretion with leu649leu/rs5729 in enac’s gamma
subunit. one may speculate that with a genetic variant with a
stronger effect on enac function, such parallel regulation of
calcium reabsorption may in part be overcome, at least in the
situation of gross increase in sodium reabsorption, thus
resulting in a minor or no net effect on calcium excretion as
we observed with  xxxg2032xxx  2_1.
coming to a critical discussion of our data from a
methodological point of view with 50 polymorphic markers
and five phenotypic parameters, the significance of most
associations summarized in table 3 would clearly be above
the level of significance of about 0.0002, which one would
obtain by conservative adjustment for multiple testing.
however, many polymorphisms were linked, resulting in
the clustering of low p-values among  xxxg2032xxx  polymorphisms in figure 2. also, the excretion parameters were
interdependent, which reduced the number of real multiple
comparisons performed. still, our approach remained
exploratory and the identified associations therefore will
have to be investigated further in clinical and functional
studies.
in conclusion, there was no evidence for functionally
relevant polymorphisms in the target protein of loop
diuretics, the  xxxg2078xxx . however, consistent with all three
loop diuretics tested and with published data, ncc and
enac variants modulated the effect of loop diuretics. the
ncc variant gly264ala appeared as a low functional variant
that was evolutionarily selected. the enac  xxxg217xxx 
haplotype  xxxg2032xxx  2_1 also resembled a low functional
variant. on the contrary, the tightly coupled variant alleles of
rs5723 (leu649leu) and rs5729 in  xxxg2034xxx  that encode the
volume 82 number 3 | september 2007 | www.nature.com/cpt

articles

enac  xxxg218xxx , marked an apparently higher functional allele. the effects of both enac variants on potassium
and calcium excretion, however, require further exploration.
all three variants should be further investigated for their
impact on long-term drug therapy with loop and other
diuretic drugs in healthy subjects as well as in patients
suffering from hypertension, cardiac, and renal diseases.
methods
clinical study. an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover
study was performed in healthy volunteers using single oral doses of
bumetanide,  xxxd2167xxx , and  xxxd3404xxx ; the three study days were
performed at least 2 weeks apart. an unselected population of 108
nonsmoking, white male volunteers aged 19 to 50 years was
screened; 97 of them completed the clinical study. all volunteers
were healthy as confirmed by physical medical examination, blood
pressure measurement, red and white blood cell counts, and
measurements of levels of serum transaminases, gamma-glutamyltransferase, serum total bilirubin,  xxxg124xxx , serum creatinine,
and electrolytes. subjects taking any drugs were excluded from the
study. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the
georg-august university, göttingen, germany. all subjects provided
written informed consent before inclusion in the study and after full
explanation of all study procedures.
the participants were instructed on how to follow a saltrestricted diet. before each of the three study days, the volunteers
adhered to this diet for 48 h before study drug intake. after the
volunteers had fasted overnight, they were asked to empty their
bladder. at about 7:30 am, a single oral dose of 2 mg bumetanide
(burinexs, emra-med, trittau, germany), 2  40 mg  xxxd2167xxx 
(lasixs, aventis, frankfurt, germany), or 10 mg  xxxd3404xxx  (unats,
roche, grenzach-wyhlen) was administered according to the
randomization scheme. volunteers fasted until 4 h after drug
administration with free access to low-carbonated water and
unsweetened, caffeine-free tea. blood samples were taken immediately before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h after dosage.
urine was collected at the respective intervals, the voided amount
was weighed, and a sample was stored together with the plasma
samples at 201c.
genotyping. genotyping was performed in all 108 screened
subjects. aiming at haplotype allele frequencies above 5%, we
selected polymorphisms (besides most nonsynonymous polymorphism) based on frequency and distance between the polymorphisms
rather than selecting potentially functional but very rare polymorphisms.
single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed by
pyroseqencings on the psqs hs96a system (biotage ab, uppsala,
sweden). polymerase chain reaction primers were designed using
primer snp design version 1.01 software (www.pyrosequencing.com). all polymerase chain reactions were carried out in a reaction
volume of 15 ml with 6 ng genomic dna, 10 mm deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 10 mm of each forward and reverse oligonucleotide
polymerase chain reaction primer (one of which is biotinylated),
(5 u/ml) taq polymerase, and 1.5 mm mgcl2 (25 mm). primer details
and polymerase chain reaction conditions are described in a
supplementary table available at www.nature.com/cpt. pyrosequencingtm protocols were standard as defined by the supplier
(biotage ab), using an internal primer diluted in 1  annealing
buffer (20 mmol/l tris-acetate, 2 mmol/l mgac2), 2  binding wash
buffer ii ph 7.6 (10 mmol/l tris hcl, 2 m nacl, 1 mmol/l edta,
0.1% tween-20), streptavidin–sepharose beads (amersham biosciences, uppsala, sweden), 0.2 m naoh, 70% ethanol, and a psq
hs96a single nucleotide polymorphism reagent kit (biotage ab).
samples were analyzed on a psq hs96a instrument with

proprietary pyrosequencingtm, software (biotage ab). controls were
included to exclude mix-ups and other errors during genotyping:
dna-free reaction mix and dedicated dna. all polymorphisms
were in hardy–weinberg equilibrium.
ld block definition. ld blocks were identified using the software
package haploviews, version 3.31.25 the linkage plot relied on the
d0 value of lewontin.26 the tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms were calculated using the haploviews tagger function with the
predefined settings. ld block definition is a critical matter of
current evaluation and ongoing discussion.27–29 the ld blocks used
in this study were defined relying on the ‘‘n þ 1’’ method of zeggini
et al.27 and the confidence interval method of gabriel et al.30 only
for the ld analysis were the two variable numbers of tandem repeat
polymorphisms in  xxxg2078xxx  recoded as having, or not having, the
most frequent allele, as the used software haploviews is restricted
to biallelic polymorphisms.  xxxg2032xxx  and  xxxg2034xxx  are located
adjacent on chromosome 16. as no linkage at all was observed
among their polymorphisms, we report them as completely separate
loci. the individual haplotypes were calculated using the software
phases, version 2.1.1.31,32 ten runs were performed starting from
the seed values 2, 1,536, 2,936, 3,122, 4,957, 5,283, 6,757, 7,992,
8,633, and 9,045. the haplotype pair most often assigned to the
individuals was used for the genotype–phenotype association.
ehh test. the ehh method is a new screening method to detect
recent positive selection in the human genome from haplotype
structure.33 it relies on the breakdown of haplotypes, including a
new mutation over time by recombination processes. positive
selection is assumed the longer a haplotype at a locus of interest
extends in relation to its frequency and other haplotypes. the ehh
method can be used to differentiate between variants, which were
evolutionarily selected because of their functional benefits for the
organism from those variants, merely selected due to linkage to a
primarily selected variant.22,34
calculation of the ehh and the ehl was not possible in our data
set as most of the resulting haplotypes apparently extended the
range of polymorphisms investigated in our study population. in
addition, maximal density of genotyped polymorphism is mandatory for complete haplotype subdivision, as incomplete haplotype
subdivision results in falsely fast apparent breakdown of the
incompletely subdivided haplotype.35 we therefore, in silico,
investigated the publicly available phased data of the 120 caucasian
(ceu) chromosomes of the hapmap project (www.hapmap.org,
release no. 21).20 the ld blocks in these data sets were widely
consistent with those in our data set. the ehh and the ehl were
explored using the software program sweeps, version 1.0, freely
available at www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/sweep. standard settings were
used throughout. the ehl is the range demarked by 50% ehh
breakdown to both sides of a given haplotype.35
drug concentration and pharmacokinetic analysis.  xxxd3404xxx  was
quantified in plasma and urine as described earlier.36,37 the limit of
quantification was 10 ng/ml for all analytes from plasma samples
and 1 ng/ml for all analytes from urine samples. bumetanide in
plasma and urine was quantified by high-performance liquid
chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. the limit
of quantification was 1 ng/ml in plasma and 10 ng/ml in urine. the
coefficient of variation was below 10% over a range from 5 to
100 ng/ml in plasma and below 20% from 25 to 500 ng/ml.
 xxxd2167xxx  was quantified in plasma and urine by reversed phase
chromatography with fluorescence detection with an excitation
wavelength of 270 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm. the
limit of quantification was 25 ng/ml  xxxd2167xxx  in both urine and
plasma. the coefficient of variation was below 25% over the range
from 25 to 4000 ng/ml.

pharmacodynamic data analysis and statistics. the relationship
between the excreted fraction (fe in %) of a respective ion and the
corresponding urinary excretion rate of loop diuretics was used to
quantitate the pharmacodynamic response.38,39 fe was individually
calculated as the respective ion clearance divided by the creatinine
clearance. clearances were calculated dividing the excreted amount
of ion or creatinine by the respective plasma area under the curve in
the respective interval. fe volume was calculated dividing urinary
volume output by the creatinine clearance. for genotype–phenotype
association, fe controlled for the individual loop diuretic excretion
rate was used throughout.
data analysis was performed using the software package spsss,
version 12.0.0. genotype–phenotype analysis was usually by
covariance analysis. model terms were the three loop diuretics as
fixed factor and its interaction with the respective genotype or
haplotype entered as covariate. single-nucleotide polymorphisms as
covariates were coded as number of variant alleles. with the two
 xxxg2078xxx  variable number of tandem repeats, association was
calculated separately for each frequent allele coded as the number
of respective alleles. haplotypes as covariates were coded as the
number of haplotype alleles. the mean effect size was calculated as
mean of the three individual effect sizes calculated from the
parameter estimates for the three loop diuretics. p-values below 0.05
were considered significant; the given covariance p-values refer to
the interaction term. a sample size of 100 subjects is sufficient to
detect polymorphisms with a frequency of 3% with a certainty of
95%. we did not formally address the problem of multiple testing
because of the exploratory nature of this study. we took some
actions to limit the possibility of false positive results. this included
that we predefined the way of analysis and 24-h excretion as the
primary parameter. furthermore, in the presentation, we restrict
ourselves to findings with at least one po0.01 in association with
24-h excretion. with these findings, the statistical power at p ¼ 0.05
was above 80%.
