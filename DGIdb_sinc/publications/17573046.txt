introduction

parkinson's disease (pd) is characterized by extensive loss of
dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and

their terminals in the striatum, and afflicts more than 500,000
people in the united states (hornykiewicz, 1973; calne, 1984).
although the etiology of idiopathic pd is not known, several
mitigating factors for the dopaminergic depletion associated

with the disease have been suggested, including programmed
cell death, viral infection, and environmental toxins. the use
of animal models has facilitated laboratory investigations into
the mechanisms of, and possible treatments for pd. the
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) lesioned rat is considered a standard model of pd (ungerstedt and arbuthnott,
1970; ungerstedt, 1971). intracranial infusion of 6-ohda
reproduces neurochemical deficits seen in pd and pronounced
behavioral asymmetries are manifested by unilaterally
lesioned animals, including hemispatial neglect and asymmetrical behavior (marshall and ungerstedt, 1977; bracha et al.,
1987). the motor asymmetry can be detected either in a drug
or drug-free state, and the magnitude of such behavioral
abnormality correlates with the degree of dopaminergic
depletion (ungerstedt, 1971; stromberg et al., 1985; hudson
et al., 1993; borlongan and sanberg, 1995). as a result of
dopamine denervation, these lesioned animals display loss of
forelimb function on the side contralateral to the lesion
(schallert et al., 2000) and show contralateral rotation when
challenged with dopamine agonists (ungerstedt, 1968), both of
which have been used as the index of parkinsonian dysfunction (wessell et al., 2004).
the recognition of pd's major pathology of neurodegeneration of the dopamine-producing nigrostriatal system (dawson
and dawson, 2002) led to the development of dopamine
replacement therapy (drt) as a treatment modality for pd.
however, patients maintained in drt over time often develop
both dyskinesia and wearing-off (nutt et al., 2002), which are
likely due to impairment of the synaptic dopamine metabolism in the putamen (rajput et al., 2004). in particular, these
deleterious response alterations to chronic drt appear to
result from the nonphysiological stimulation of dopamine
receptors on striatal medium spiny neurons, which may lead
to reactive changes in their responses to cortical glutamatergic
input (wessell et al., 2004; mouradian et al., 1990; chase and
oh, 2000). treatment strategies that are designed to exert
more continuous, and thus enhanced physiological, dopamine receptor stimulation may circumvent these adverse
changes associated with chronic drt.
 xxxd3145xxx  is a novel, non-ergoline dopamine receptor
agonist (eden et al., 1991), which specifically binds to dopamine 2 receptors ( xxxg656xxx ) with a selectivity similar to that of
dopamine thereby avoiding ergot-related adverse effects
(tulloch, 1997). as monotherapy or as combination therapy
with levodopa,  xxxd3145xxx  has been shown to ameliorate
parkinsonian symptoms in laboratory studies (pearce et al.,
1998; iida et al., 1999; schapira, 2002; hoglinger et al., 2004),
as well as in clinical trials (adler et al., 1997; sethi et al.,
1998; lieberman et al., 1998; grosset et al., 2004; morgan and
sethi, 2004). however, the mechanisms underlying  xxxd3145xxx 's therapeutic effects remain to be determined. based on
recent studies suggesting that  xxxg656xxx  and d3r are possible
targets of  xxxd3145xxx  (millan et al., 2002; rogers et al., 2000),
we directly examined the role of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r in ropiniroleinduced amelioration of pd symptoms. in this study, we
manipulated the expression of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r in the brain by
loading the  xxxg656xxx  or d3r receptor gene into lentivirus, then
stereotaxically infusing the viral vector(s) directly into the
dopamine-depleted striatum of 6-ohda unilaterally lesioned
rats.

the main hypothesis tested in this study was that high
expression of  xxxg656xxx , d3r or both receptors in the parkinsonian
brain would enhance the therapeutic effects of  xxxd3145xxx . we
chose the post-lesion treatment paradigm (6-ohda lesion
followed by  xxxg656xxx /d3r receptor manipulation, as well as
 xxxd3145xxx  administration) to provide better clinical relevance
of such experimental therapy. the study was designed to
characterize behavioral responses (e.g., forelimb akinesia and
dopamine agonist-induced rotational behavior), histologically
analyze th-positive cells and fibers in the nigra and striatum,
respectively, and reveal  xxxg656xxx  and d3r protein levels and
binding in the ventral striatum via western immunoblot and
autoradiographic assays.

results

2.1.
 xxxg656xxx /d3r over-expression facilitates behavioral
effects of subtherapeutic  xxxd3145xxx 
animals included in this study showed 3 or less foothops, and
8 or greater complete turns in the forelimb akinesia test and
apomorphine-induced rotational test, respectively, at 1 month
post-lesion. following the 9-day treatment of a subtherapeutic
dose of  xxxd3145xxx  at 5 months post-lesion, lesioned animals
that received striatal over-expression of both  xxxg656xxx  and d3r
exhibited a significant increase in the use of the previously
akinetic contralateral forelimb and produced robust circling
behavior compared to lesioned animals that received blank
lentiviral vector (fig. 1). on the other hand, lesioned animals
that received sole over-expression of  xxxg656xxx  or d3r displayed
only modest, but not significant, motor effects compared to
blank lentiviral vector. for forelimb akinesia test following
 xxxd3145xxx  treatment, anova revealed significant treatment
effects (f3,42 = 16.78, p < 0.0001), and pair-wise comparisons
using fisher plsd revealed significant difference only when
comparing lesioned animals that received both over-expression of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r to lesioned animals that received blank
vectors,  xxxg656xxx  alone or d3r alone (p's < 0.0001). statistical
analyses of rotational behavior after  xxxd3145xxx  treatment
parallel those of forelimb akinesia test in that anova revealed
significant treatment effects (f3,42 = 7.57, p < 0.001), and pairwise comparisons using fisher plsd revealed significant
difference only when comparing lesioned animals that
received both over-expression of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r to lesioned
animals that received blank vectors,  xxxg656xxx  alone or d3r alone
(p's < 0.05).

2.2.

dopamine receptor transgene expression

transgene expression as revealed by epifluorescence microscopy was limited within the striatum, with extrastriatal (e.g.,
corpus callosum, cortex and subventricular zone) expression
limited along the needle track (fig. 2). the number of virally
infected striatal cells (19,000 to 23,000) did not significantly
differ across  xxxg656xxx -, d3r- and  xxxg656xxx /d3r-treated groups (p > 0.05;
fig. 4). in lesioned animals that received both  xxxg656xxx  and d3r
transgenes, at least 90% of virally infected cells co-expressed
both transgenes as revealed by merged gfp and red immunofluorescence in many cells (fig. 2). similarly, the anterior–

posterior striatal area of viral spread (8.8 to 10 sections) did not
significantly differ across groups (p > 0.05; fig. 3). there were
sporadic and few (less than 10 cells per animal) autofluorescent cells in lesioned animals that received blank lentiviral
vectors.

2.3.
correlational analyses between behavioral response
and transgene expression
in order to reveal whether improved use of the akinetic
forelimb and prolonged rotational response correspond with
number of cells virally infected with specific transgene, we
performed regression analyses. regression coefficients revealed positive correlations between increased use of akinetic
forelimb or increase duration of rotational response and number of cells virally infected with both  xxxg656xxx  and d3r transgenes
(p's < 0.05), but not with number of cells virally infected with
blank vector,  xxxg656xxx  alone or d3r alone (fig. 4). these results
indicate that increased transgene expression of both  xxxg656xxx  and
d3r in the lesioned striatum facilitated behavioral effects of
 xxxd3145xxx .

immunohistochemistry

all lesioned animals showed at least 90% dopamine depletion
characterized by few spared th positive nigral neurons and
near complete denervation of th positive striatal fibers. there
were no statistically significant differences in th positive
nigral cells counts and th positive striatal fiber optical density
across the four groups (p's > 0.05; fig. 5). on the other hand,
double and triple labeling with immunoflourescence revealed
that  xxxg656xxx  and d3r are expressed in  xxxg2240xxx  and enkephalin
striatal neurons in the lesioned brains of animals that received
lentivirally transfections of either or both receptor genes (fig.
6). less than 10% of  xxxg2240xxx  and enkephalin neurons
double- or triple-labeled with  xxxg656xxx  and/or d3r in lesioned
brains that received blank vectors.

fig. 2 – epifluorescence microscopy revealed very few autofluorescent cells in lesioned animals that received blank lentiviral
vectors (panel a), gfp fluorescent cells in lesioned animals that received  xxxg656xxx  transgene (panel b), red fluorescent cells in
lesioned animals that received d3r transgene (panel c), and gfp, red, and merged fluorescent cells (panels d–f, respectively) in
lesioned animals that received both  xxxg656xxx /d3r transgenes. scale bar equals 100 mum.

(fig. 7). in contrast, we found an almost complete absence of
d3r coupled with hypersensitive levels of  xxxg656xxx  in the lesioned
striatum of animals that received blank vectors.

western blot assays

lentiviral transfection with  xxxg656xxx  and d3r revealed enhanced
 xxxg656xxx  and d3r protein levels in the lesioned striatum of animals
compared to those that received blank vectors (fig. 8). bands of
the appropriate predicted size for the  xxxg656xxx  (about 47 kda) and
d3r (about 49 kda) were detected.

transgene stereotaxic revealed no significant differences
across these three groups (p > 0.05). lower panel: similarly,
the anterior–posterior striatal area of viral spread (8.8 to

discussion

the present study demonstrated direct participation of dopamine receptors in  xxxd3145xxx  therapeutic outcome in pd, in
that amelioration of parkinsonian symptoms by the dopamine
agonist required the presence of both  xxxg656xxx  and d3r. moreover,
the over-expression of these two dopamine receptors facilitated the subtherapeutic dose of  xxxd3145xxx  to exert functional
effects. thus, in addition to providing evidence of a dopamine
receptor-mediated mechanism underlying  xxxd3145xxx 's mode
of action, we showed that  xxxd3145xxx  at a subtherapeutic dose
(0.2 mg/kg) may achieve clinically relevant functional improvements when dopamine receptors are augmented. although the reported adverse side effects of  xxxd3145xxx  at the
therapeutic dose of 2.0 mg/kg in rats (16 mg/day in pd patients; morgan and sethi, 2004) are minimal or at least less
than that seen with levodopa, the availability of a subtherapeutic dose would likely be much more tolerated in the
clinic. a lower  xxxd3145xxx  dose may produce less peripheral
edema, restrict the drug's effect on the nigrostriatal system
thereby sparing the mesolimbic system and causing fewer
neuropsychiatric effects, and perhaps lead to less somnolence. of note, edema, hallucinations, and somnolence are
three major side effects reported in pd patients treated with
dopamine agonists.

fig. 4 – regression analyses revealed positive correlations between forelimb akinesia (r 2 = 0.84, p < 0.0001; regression line,
y = 11001.5 + 6708.7) or duration of rotations (r 2 = 0.92, p < 0.05; regression line, y = 5743.1 + 7480.2) and number of virally  xxxg656xxx /d3r
transfected cells, indicating behavioral improvements produced by  xxxd3145xxx  correlated with increased number of
 xxxg656xxx /d3r-expressing cells.

fig. 5 – at 5 months post-lesion, th immunohistochemistry revealed that all animals included in this study displayed at
least 90% depletion of th positive nigral neurons (panel b, with lesioned side magnified in panel c and intact side magnified in
panel d) and near complete denervation of th positive striatal fibers (panel a). the figure presented corresponds to lesioned
animals that received both  xxxg656xxx  and d3r transgenes. cell counts of th positive nigral cells counts (panel e) and measurements
of optical density of th positive striatal fibers (panel f) revealed no statistically significant differences across the four groups
(p's > 0.05).

the loss of forelimb function on the side contralateral to
the lesion (schallert et al., 2000) and the onset of contralateral
rotation when challenged with dopamine agonists (ungerstedt, 1968) are hallmarks of parkinsonian symptoms in rodents with unilateral dopaminergic depletion. these
hemiparkinsonian animals, when challenged with levodopa
treatment, initially exhibit robust rotational behavior, but over
time display a progressive shortening in turning response
duration (engber et al., 1994; papa et al., 1994; oh et al., 1997).
this diminished therapeutic efficacy of levodopa in hemiparkinsonian animals mimics the clinical manifestation seen
in patients with advanced pd characterized by wearing-off
fluctuations during chronic drt (papa et al., 1994; metman et
al., 2000; wessell et al., 2004).  xxxd3145xxx , in the present study,
significantly potentiates the use of the contralateral forelimb
and prolongs the turning response duration; the magnitude of
these  xxxd3145xxx -triggered behavioral responses are comparable to that produced by acute levodopa seen in other studies
(papa et al., 1994; wessell et al., 2004).
an equally major finding in this study is the robust behavioral effects produced by  xxxd3145xxx  observed at 5 months postlesion. to our knowledge, this is the longest post-lesion delay
period demonstrating therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd3145xxx  in pd.
these observations suggest that at moderate or perhaps even
advanced stage pd,  xxxd3145xxx  may be able to exert behavioral
improvements as long as dopamine receptors, specifically  xxxg656xxx 

and d3r, remain available in the striatum. in the event that
these dopamine receptors become dysfunctional due to disease progression, we presented here a proof-of-concept

fig. 6 – immunoflourescence microscopy revealed that  xxxg656xxx 
and d3r co-localized with  xxxg2240xxx  (78–82%) and
enkephalin striatal neurons (69–74%) in the lesioned brains of
animals that received single gene lentiviral transfections. in a
subset of  xxxg2240xxx  and enkephalin striatal neurons
(36–39%), both receptor genes were expressed when double
gene transfections were carried out. in contrast, less than
10% of  xxxg2240xxx  and enkephalin neurons double- or
triple-labeled with  xxxg656xxx  and/or d3r in lesioned brains that
received blank vectors.

fig. 7 – receptor binding assays for d2 ([3h] raclopride) and
d3 ([125i] trans 7-oh-pipat) revealed near normal d2 and d3
receptors (compared to contralateral intact striatum) in the
lesioned striatum of animals that received  xxxg656xxx  and d3r
transfections. in contrast, an almost complete absence of
d3r, coupled with hypersensitive levels of  xxxg656xxx , was found in
the lesioned striatum of animals that received blank vectors.
the  xxxg656xxx  and d3r binding levels in the contralateral,
non-lesioned striatum did not differ between  xxxg656xxx /d3r and
black vector transfected animals (1.3 ([3h] raclopride and 2.45
[125i] trans 7-oh-pipat fmols/mg tissue, respectively),
which closely approximate the values found in the lesioned
striatum of animals that received  xxxg656xxx  and d3r transfections.

supporting the use of lentiviral vector strategy for enhancing
the expression of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r. despite the long delay from
transgene delivery to  xxxd3145xxx  treatment, robust functional
effects were still obtained, suggesting that lentiviral vectors
produce stable transgene expression over time.
dopamine receptor selectivity distinguishes d1r and d5r
as receptors with similar selectivity, whereas  xxxg656xxx , d3r and
d4r are categorized as belonging to another family of receptors (graybiel et al., 2000).  xxxd3145xxx  has long been thought to
be a selective  xxxg656xxx  agonist (eden et al., 1991; tulloch, 1997).
here, we showed that  xxxg656xxx  and d3r are required for  xxxd3145xxx 
therapeutic outcome. from a basic science standpoint, these
results reveal that  xxxg656xxx  and d3r are distinct from each other,
and that while both possess similar structural properties, the
presence of one specific receptor cannot compensate for the
role of the other absent receptor. furthermore, the data
suggest that during dopaminergic depletion, at least in the 6ohda lesion model, endogenous  xxxg656xxx  and d3r are both altered
and may limit therapeutic effects of dopamine receptor
agonists like  xxxd3145xxx . we demonstrated in the present
study that enhancing receptor availability via the lentiviral
vector approach facilitated anti-parkinsonian effects of
 xxxd3145xxx .
the present lentiviral delivery of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r, while increasing protein levels of these two receptors in the striatum
of the lesioned animals (fig. 8), normalized the receptor binding for both receptors (fig. 7). in particular, the  xxxg656xxx  binding
was suppressed after transfection of  xxxg656xxx /d3r compared to
transfection of blank vector, but was near normal level seen in
the contralateral, non-lesioned striatum. this observation
parallels previous reports that  xxxg656xxx  binding is significantly
increased after unilateral 6-ohda lesions in rats (araki et al.,

2000a,b; chalon et al., 1999), in mptp-treated nonhuman
primates (bezard et al., 2001; elsworth et al., 1998), and in pd
patients (scherfler et al., 2006; piggott et al., 1999). moreover,
such increased  xxxg656xxx  binding largely occurs in the ipsilateral
dopamine-denervated striatum, but only negligible or not
significant in the contralateral, intact striatum (araki et al.,
2000a,b). in addition, the observed down-regulation of  xxxg656xxx 
binding (i.e., suppression of 6-ohda-induced increment in
 xxxg656xxx  binding) agrees with previous reports using similar
dopamine agonists (e.g. levodopa, pergolide, cabergoline) in
pd animal models (goulet et al., 2000) and patients
(antonini et al., 1997; linazasoro et al., 1999). such
restoration of a normalized  xxxg656xxx  binding by dopamine
agonists can be enhanced by our lentiviral vector delivery
of  xxxg656xxx  gene. while it appears paradoxical to deliver  xxxg656xxx 
gene in combination with  xxxg656xxx  agonist if  xxxg656xxx  binding was
already increased in this pd model, we hypothesize that
 xxxg656xxx  activity remains dysfunctional in pd. indeed, a study
demonstrated that while  xxxg656xxx  binding is elevated,  xxxg656xxx 
mrna displays compensatory levels in chronic pd (narang
and wamsley, 1995), suggesting that  xxxg656xxx  augmentation
therapy, such as the present  xxxg656xxx  gene delivery, is beneficial
in pd.
accumulating evidence has implicated dopamine agonists,
including  xxxd3145xxx , in neuroprotection (schapira, 2002; iida et
al., 1999). in particular, a recent study demonstrates that stem
cell proliferation is impaired in the experimentally induced
dopamine-depleted adult rodent brain, but neurogenesis is
restored to near normal levels by  xxxg656xxx  selective agonists
(hoglinger et al., 2004). the present  xxxd3145xxx -induced behavioral improvements were achieved in the absence of
neuronal rescue of th positive striatal fibers or nigral neurons,
coupled with  xxxg656xxx  and d3r transgene expression limited to a
relatively small number of striatal cells (i.e.,  xxxg2240xxx - and
enkephalin-immunoreactive neurons) and minimal or lack of
gross morphological changes in the extrastriatal regions (corpus callosum and cortex, as well as the neurogenic subventricular zone) suggesting that “neuroprotection” at this late
stage pd model (i.e., 5 months post-6-ohda lesion) is not
apparent. however, based on the reported neuroprotective
effects of stem cells when either endogenously stimulated or
exogenously transplanted during the early phase of disease progression in a variety of cns paradigms, including
pd (chiang et al., 2005; yu et al., 2005; borlongan et al.,
2004c), this neurogenic potential of  xxxd3145xxx  warrants further investigations.
in summary,  xxxd3145xxx  attenuates forelimb akinesia deficits and increases the duration of rotational behavior via a
mechanism that involves  xxxg656xxx  and d3r activation. these

experimental procedures

4.1.

subjects

a total of 46 sprague–dawley male rats (250–300 g) were used.
all animal care and use followed the nih guidelines and
augusta va acuc guidelines for the use of animals in
research. the animals had free access to food and water in
their home cage. the rats were housed in a temperature and
humidity-controlled colony, which was maintained on a
12:12 h light/dark cycle with light on at 07:00 h. animals were
acclimated to the vivarium for at least 3 days prior to initial
testing. daily monitoring of animals throughout the study
revealed that none of the animals displayed signs of ill health.

4.2.

lesion surgery

all animals initially underwent 6-ohda lesion surgery as
described previously (borlongan et al., 2002). animals were
anesthetized using equithesin (300 mg/kg, i.p.), and placed in a
stereotaxic apparatus (kopf instruments). 6-ohda (8 mug,
sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) was infused (3 mul) into the medial
forebrain bundle using a hamilton syringe (26-gauge needle)
over a 5-min period with an additional 5 min prior to retraction of the needle. the lesion coordinates were: 4 mm posterior to bregma, 0.8 mm lateral to the midline and 8 mm below
the dura (paxinos and watson, 1986). body temperature of the
animals was kept at 37 °c using a heating pad and a rectal
temperature probe. the animals were monitored until recovery from anesthesia. at 1 month following lesion surgery,
animals were screened for successful dopaminergic depletion
using the routine behavioral tests, namely apomorphineinduced rotation test and forelimb akinesia test (wessell et al.,
2004; borlongan and sanberg, 1995). only animals that displayed 3 or less foot hops and 8 or greater complete turns per
minute in the forelimb akinesia test and apomorphineinduced rotation test, respectively, were included in this
study.

viral vector preparation

the viral vectors utilized in this study are a kind gift from dr.
didier trono, university of geneva, switzerland. plasmid
constructs of  xxxg656xxx  and d3r were generated from wild type
human  xxxg656xxx  and d3r in mammalian expression vector pcmv5
as previously described (robinson and caron, 1996; kim et al.,
2001). the correct  xxxg656xxx  and d3r inserts were isolated (bamhi/
ecori) and inserted into pires2-egfp plasmid (clontech) at
bglii and ecori sites. the  xxxg656xxx /gfp or d3r/red cassette was
then isolated at ndei and noti sites and inserted into the phr′cmv transfer vector at ndei and ecori sites. ecori and noti
sites were blunt ended by klenow reaction before ligation. all
inserts were verified by dna sequencing. generation of high
titer retrovirus is described in detail (dull et al., 1998). briefly,
5 × 106 293/hek cells (atcc crl 1573) were seeded in a 100 mm
plates. 3.5 mug of the envelope plasmid (pmd.g), 6.5 mug of pack-

119

aging plasmid (deltar8.2), and 10 mug of transfer vector plasmid
carrying the  xxxg656xxx  or d3r gene were transiently transfected into
293 cells by a calcium phosphate precipitation method. virions secreted into the medium were harvested after 24 to
72 h. the medium was pooled, filtered through a 0.23 mum pore
size cellulose acetate filter, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 28,000 k, 4 °c, 90 min. the pellet was resuspended in suitable media and 20 mul aliquots were stored at
−80 °c until needed.

4.4.

viral titer

assays to evaluate viral titer are described in detail (zufferey
et al., 1999). briefly, five serial 1:2 dilutions of filtered vector
stock are used to transduce hela cells in six-well plates at 2–
3 × 105 cells/well. the highest and lowest inocula correspond to
100 and 6.25 ml of undiluted supernatant, respectively. vector
particles were added to 2 ml of culture medium. after 48 to
60 h incubation, the percentage of gfp- or red-positive cells
(for  xxxg656xxx  and d3r, respectively) was determined with a
fluorescence-activated cell sorter on a beckton dickinson
facscan. to calculate titers (transducing units per ml), 2–
3 × 105 cells/well are multiplied by the percentage of gfp- or
red-positive cells, and this product was divided by the number
of microliters in the inoculum. titers of 108 tu/ml were used
in this study.

4.5.

viral vector surgical delivery

at 1 month post-lesion, animals that reached the behavioral
criteria for successful dopamine denervation were randomly
assigned to one of the four treatment conditions: (1) blank
lenitiviral vector (n = 10); (2)  xxxg656xxx  lentivirus (n = 12); (3) d3r
lentivirus (n = 12), or; (4)  xxxg656xxx  and d3r lentiviruses (n = 12). we
initially considered cell transduction by co-expression of d2rires-d3r. however, the cell transduction efficiency of coexpressed genes is believed to be similar to that achieved by
 xxxg656xxx -ires-gfp combined with d3r-ires-red. in addition, the
advantages of transducing cells with separate ires constructs
over the single ires construct include being able to follow the
lineage of the transduced cells (using both gfp and red
markers), as well as more stable continuous expression of the
transgenes. indeed, a recent study has shown the feasibility,
excellent transduction efficiency and functional efficacy of
this double transgene expression using two lentiviral vector
constructs (koya et al., 2004). in addition, we want to point
out that we used human dopamine receptor genes, thus
allowing us to delineate endogenous (rat) from exogenous
expression of these two genes. animals were anesthetized by
equithesin (300 mg/kg, i.p.) and positioned in the stereotaxic
apparatus (kopf instruments). using a 10-mul 26-gauge hamilton syringe needle, 3 mul of viral suspension (108 tu/ml) was
slowly injected into the following coordinates targeting the
lesioned striatum: ap: + 0.5 mm; ml: 2.8 mm; dv: − 5.0 mm
(paxinos and watson, 1986). the viral suspension was infused
over a 5-min period with an additional 5 min absorption time
prior to retraction of the needle. body temperature of the
animals was kept at 37 °c using a heating pad and a rectal
temperature probe. the animals were monitored until recovery from anesthesia.

drug administration

at about 5 months after the lesion, animals received
 xxxd3145xxx  (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for the next nine consecutive
days. the present dosage corresponds to a subtherapeutic
dose of  xxxd3145xxx  (iida et al., 1999; rogers et al., 2000; reavill et
al., 2000; prikhojan et al., 2000). following this 9-day  xxxd3145xxx 
treatment, animals were again introduced to the two behavioral tests, but for the rotational test the animals did not
receive apomorphine injection. after the behavioral tests, animals were euthanized for examination of dopamine receptor
transgene expression and th immunoreactivity.

4.7.

behavioral tests

at 1 month post-lesion and again at about 5 months after the
lesion (following the 9-day  xxxd3145xxx  treatment), animals
were subjected to behavioral tests that have been shown to
reveal parkinsonian symptoms. the forelimb akinesia test
(wessell et al., 2004) is a more rapid variant of the schallert
forelimb asymmetry test. the animal was gently held so that
both hindpaws and one forepaw were held in a fixed position.
the remaining forepaw (to be tested) was placed on a table,
and the animal was passively moved sideways along the table
surface (0.9 m in 5 s), first in one direction, then the opposite
direction. for assessment of the left forepaw, movement was
to the right; for assessment of the left forepaw, movement
was to the left. as the animal was moved, it attempted
adjusting movements with its table-placed forepaw, and the
number of these movements was counted. this test was
performed twice with each forelimb after 3 consecutive days
of drug treatment. final results were expressed as the mean
of the two trials for the contralateral forepaw. about an hour
after the forelimb akinesia test, the rotational test was
conducted. at 1 month post-lesion, the rotational test included apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) injections, and animals
were monitored over 1 h (borlongan and sanberg, 1995). in
contrast, the rotational testing at 5 months post-lesion
(following the 9-day  xxxd3145xxx  treatment) excluded apomorphine injections; instead, rotational behavior was monitored
for 1 h from the onset of the first complete turn made by each
animal after  xxxd3145xxx  treatment on day 9. the experimenter
testing the animals was blinded to the treatment condition of
each animal.

4.8.

dopamine receptor transgene expression

after conducting the behavioral tests at 5 months post-lesion,
animals were deeply anesthetized with equithesin (500 mg/kg,
i.p.) and perfused intracardiacally with 150 ml saline followed
by 150 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. the brains were post-fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently immersed in 20% sucrose in 4% paraformaldehyde for an
additional day, then rinsed and stored in 20% sucrose at
−80 °c until sectioning. a cryostat was used to cut the brain
(30-mum sections). several criteria were used to verify  xxxg656xxx  and
d3r transgene expression at stereotaxic injection sites. since
the  xxxg656xxx  gene was expressed as a gfp fusion protein, and the
d3r as a ds-red shift fusion protein, they were readily detected
in thin section slices using epifluoresence microscopy. this

stra>tegy was also used to monitor viral expression and possible spread in host tissue. based on this modification, the
epifluoresence strategy was used to (a) estimate the number of
virally infected cells, and (b) estimate the area of potential
viral spread from injection site. in addition, morphological
analysis could allow identification of specific neuronal cell
types infected and a crude evaluation of potential cytotoxic
side effects associated with long term viral and transgene
expression. however, this phenotypic characterization of
infected cells will be confirmed in a subsequent study. to
adjust for spontaneous gfp or red shift epifluorescence from
lesioned tissue, the data from lesioned animals that received
blank lentiviral vectors were used to reveal autofluorescent
cells. for epifluorescence microscopy protocol, we refer to our
published papers utilizing such approach (irons et al., 2004;
borlongan et al., 2004a,b). briefly, based on our recent
experience with visualizing the extent of the lentiviral
transfection within the striatal tissue, we found a maximal
transfection extent of about 300 mum (150 mum anterior and
150 mum posterior from the original bregma anterior–posterior
stereotaxic infusion site. accordingly, we decided to cut 20
consecutive 30 mum sections to capture the whole transfected
area. an allowance of 5 sections anterior and 5 sections
posterior to the infusion site were performed. since no
immunostaining was required for such gfp/red epifluorescence microscopy, we were able to determine the sections that
captured the transfected area. these selected striatal sections
were subsequently processed for immunohistochemistry (see
below).

4.9.

immunohistochemistry

twenty serial striatal sections (obtained from epifluorescence
microscopy above correspond to sections approximately between 2 mm anterior and 0.2 mm posterior to the bregma)
(paxinos and watson, 1986) and three consecutive sections of
substantia nigra (sn, corresponding to sections − 5.3 mm,
−5.4 mm and −5.5 mm with respect to the bregma) (paxinos
and watson, 1986) were processed for th immunohistochemistry. sections were pre-incubated in 5% blocking serum
(normal goat, jackson immunoresearch laboratories, pa,
usa) dissolved in 0.1% triton x-100 in 0.1 m napbs for
60 min, followed by incubation in the primary th antibody
(eugene tech international, nj, usa; 1:1000 dilution) at room
temperature overnight. in addition, the alternate striatal
sections were incubated in  xxxg2240xxx  antibody (chemicon,
temecula, ca, usa; 1:500 dilution) and enkephalin antibody
(chemicon, temecula, ca, usa; 1:1,000 dilution). the sections
were then reacted with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 45 min, followed by an avidin–biotin–
peroxidase complex system (abc elite vectastain kit, vector,
burlingame, ca, usa) for 45 min. finally, the vector vip kit
(vector, burlingame, ca, usa) was used to visualize the reaction product. the sections were mounted on gelatin-coated
glass slides, dried overnight, dehydrated in increasing alcohol
concentrations, and coverslipped using permount. the sections (at 4× magnification) were digitized using a pc-based
image tools computer program. for estimation of th-,  xxxg2240xxx - and enkepahlin-immunoreactive neurons, sections
were blind-coded and abercrombie's formula was used to

br a i n r es e a rc h 1 1 6 0 ( 2 00 7 ) 1 1 3 –1 23

calculate the total number of immunoreactive neurons. the
total number of immunoreactive neurons in the sn pars
compacta (for th) and striatum (for  xxxg2240xxx  and enkephalin) was counted on both sides. the criterion for
delineating the sn pars compacta from the ventral tegmental
area was the localization of the oculomotor nerve root. for
estimation of th immunoreactivity in the striatum, the
relative optical density (od) was evaluated using the nih
image program, and expressed as logarithmic od of striatum/logarithmic od of white matter. additional quantification analysis involved counting  xxxg2240xxx - and enkephalinimmunoreactive neurons that double- and triple-labeled with
 xxxg656xxx  and d3r.

4.10.

 xxxg656xxx /d3r receptor binding assays

for  xxxg656xxx , sections were incubated with 1.0 nm 3[h]nemaonapride, 1.2 nm [3h]spiperone in the presence of 40 nm  xxxd2419xxx 
or 5 nm [3h]raclopride (tarazi et al., 1997). for d3r, sections
were incubated with 3 nm [3h]7-oh-pipat (joyce et al., 2004).
the sections were exposed to tritium sensitive films. they
were developed and fixed in d-19 (eastman kodak, ny). optical
densities of brain regions were measured using a computerbased densitometer image analyzer (mcdi-mi, imaging
research inc., canada). the ods were converted to nci/mg
using the calibrated standards.

4.11.

western blotting and densitometric analysis

brains were removed rapidly from decapitated rats. the
striatum was dissected and frozen immediately on dry ice.
brain samples were homogenized in 20 volume of buffer
containing 20 mm hepes, ph 7.9, 0.4 m nacl, 20% glycerol,
5 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm edta, 0.1 mm egta, 1% igepal ca-630,
10 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm p-aminobenzamidine, 1 mg/ml
pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm
dithiothreitol. samples were incubated in this buffer for 30
min at 4°c, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000×g for 30 min. protein concentration in resulting
extracts was assayed using bio-rad bradford method. aliquots
of protein extracts (containing 70 mug of protein) were boiled for
3 min and separated by size on a mini-gel sds-page apparatus
(bio-rad) using 10% polyacrylamide gel (with a 29:1 ratio of
acrylamide to n, n′-methylenebisacrrylamide). proteins were
transferred electrophoretically to a pdvf membrane (millipore). blots were incubated with anti  xxxg656xxx  (abcam) or d3r
(alpha diagnostic international inc) antibody at 1:2000 dilution in buffer 5% nonfat dairy milk for 2 h. goat anti-rabbit igg
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used to detect the
binding of anti- xxxg656xxx /d3r antibody. the immunoreactive
bands were detected by ecl kit (amersham bioscience)
using image station 2000r system (kodak, ny) and
densitometric analysis was performed.
