stimulation by transforming growth factor-alpha of dna synthesis and proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes in primary cultures: modulation by alph...  we investigated the effects of transforming growth factor alpha (tgf-alpha) on dna synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and examined the influence of alpha and beta adrenoceptor agonists on the tgf-alpha-induced responses. tgf-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) produced a 4.1-fold elevation of dna synthesis during 3 h of culture and a 1.2-fold increase in the nucleus number (proliferation) during 4 h of culture at a cell density of 3.3 x 10(4) cells/cm(2). the tgf-alpha-induced hepatocyte dna synthesis and proliferation were dose-dependent at ec(50) values of 0.36 ng/ml and 0.45 ng/ml, respectively. hepatocyte dna synthesis and proliferation induced by 1.0 ng/ml tgf-alpha did not reduce even at higher initial plating densities (5.0 x 10(4) and 1.0 x 10(5) cells/cm(2)). increasing concentrations of the beta(2) adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2583xxx  (10(-7)-10(-6) m) markedly reduced the proliferative effects of tgf-alpha, whereas those of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino]-quinoxaline (uk-14304; 10(-6)-10(-5) m) and the alpha(1) adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-6) m) significantly potentiated the tgf-alpha action. the proliferative effects of tgf-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) were not affected significantly by a monoclonal antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody (1-100 ng/ml) and were almost completely blocked by specific inhibitors of signal transducers such as genistein (10(-5) m), 1-6[[17beta-3methoxyestra-1,3, 5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1h-pyrrol2,5-dione (u-73122; 0(-5) m),  xxxd3536xxx  (5 x 10(-7) m), sphingosine (5 x 10(-6) m), 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone ( xxxd1169xxx ; 5 x 10(-5) m), and rapamycin (10 ng/ml). these results suggest that among the elements that link signals of cell surface receptor to the nucleus, the proliferative action of tgf-alpha is mediated, at least, by  xxxg2198xxx , phospholipase c, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase c, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and ribosomal protein p70 s6 kinase.
