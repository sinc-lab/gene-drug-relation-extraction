summary
abstract

irbesartan (avapro®,  xxxd2382xxx ®) is a potent and selective  xxxg99xxx  subtype 1
receptor antagonist indicated for use in patients with hypertension, including those
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy.
once-daily administration of irbesartan provided 24-hour control of blood
pressure (bp). in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension irbesartan was as
effective as enalapril, atenolol and amlodipine, and more effective than  xxxd3487xxx 
in terms of absolute reduction in bp and response rates. irbesartan produced a
greater reduction in diastolic bp at trough than once-daily losartan, but had a
smaller effect than olmesartan; the reduction in systolic bp achieved with
irbesartan was similar or greater than that with losartan and similar to that seen
with olmesartan. the combination of irbesartan with hydrochlorothiazide produced additive effects on bp reduction. irbesartan also induced regression of left
ventricular mass in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.
in two large studies (irbesartan microalbuminuria type 2 diabetes mellitus in
hypertensive patients [irma 2] and the irbesartan diabetic nephropathy trial
[idnt]) irbesartan exerted a renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes at both the early and later stages of diabetic nephropathy. the
renoprotective effect was at least partly independent of the bp-lowering effect. in
the irma 2 trial, the proportion of patients progressing to overt nephropathy was
significantly lower for recipients of irbesartan 300mg once daily than placebo. in
patients with overt nephropathy in the idnt, irbesartan 300mg once daily
provided significantly greater renoprotection than amlodipine 10mg once daily or
placebo. the relative risk of doubling of serum creatinine was significantly lower
with irbesartan than amlodipine or placebo.
irbesartan is well tolerated in hypertensive patients, including those with type 2
diabetes and incipient or overt nephropathy. the overall incidence of adverse
events with irbesartan was similar to that with placebo. irbesartan was associated
with a lower incidence of cough than enalapril and was not associated with ankle
oedema or with any clinically significant drug interactions.

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

1001

in conclusion, irbesartan is a well tolerated and effective antihypertensive
agent. it also slows the progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes at both the early and later stages of diabetic nephropathy. thus,
irbesartan is a valuable agent in the management of patients with these indications.
pharmacodynamic
properties

irbesartan selectively binds to the  xxxg99xxx  receptor subtype 1 (at1),
inhibiting the activity of  xxxg99xxx . studies in normotensive volunteers
indicate that irbesartan exerts a long-lasting inhibitory effect on the pressor
response to exogenous  xxxg99xxx . irbesartan 5–300mg induced elevations in
plasma renin activity and  xxxg99xxx  levels in volunteers with or without renal
failure. in healthy volunteers, the at1 blockade induced by irbesartan was
generally significantly greater and of longer duration than that induced by losartan
and  xxxd3487xxx . while irbesartan and candesartan demonstrated a similar extent of
at1 antagonistic activity in vivo, ex vivo/in vitro studies suggested higher
antagonistic activity for irbesartan. a greater reduction in aldosterone levels and a
greater increase in plasma renin activity occurred with irbesartan than with
candesartan.
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (bp) did not change significantly after
single doses of irbesartan 5–300mg in salt-replete normotensive volunteers, but
decreased following single doses of irbesartan 10–100mg in salt-depleted volunteers. heart rate was unaltered.
in healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients, irbesartan 50mg and 100mg,
respectively, increased renal blood flow and decreased renal vascular resistance
without affecting the glomerular filtration rate. irbesartan 50mg increased sodium
excretion in normotensive volunteers, without altering potassium or  xxxd3472xxx 
excretion.

pharmacokinetic
properties

the mean bioavailability of irbesartan is approximately 60–80% after oral administration and is not affected by food. after administration of single or multiple
doses of irbesartan 150–300mg, maximum plasma drug concentrations (cmax)
were achieved within 1.5–2 hours. values for cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (auc) are dose-related within this range and values are similar
after single or multiple doses. irbesartan is ≥90% bound to plasma proteins and
has a steady-state volume of distribution of 53–93l.
the primary metabolic fate of irbesartan is oxidation via cytochrome p450
(cyp) isoform 2c9. metabolism by cyp3a4 is negligible. the pharmacological
activity of metabolites is minimal. after oral administration to healthy volunteers
<10% and 30% of the parent drug was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively.
total plasma clearance of irbesartan was approximately 9–11 l/h, of which
approximately 0.18 l/h was renal clearance. the elimination half-life of multiple
doses of irbesartan 150 or 300mg was 11 hours.
no differences were noted in the pharmacokinetic properties of irbesartan
between healthy men and women, but the auc and cmax were higher in elderly
than younger volunteers. the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not
significantly altered by mild-to-moderate or severe renal impairment, mild-tomoderate hepatic impairment or heart failure.
no significant and clinically relevant drug interactions have been identified
between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, simvastatin,  xxxd3394xxx ,

warfarin, magnesium and aluminium hydroxides or digoxin. fluconazole
increased the irbesartan cmax and auc by 19% and 63%.
therapeutic efficacy in
hypertension

monotherapy with irbesartan 150–300mg once daily was effective at reducing bp
in patients with hypertension in double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, leading to placebo-subtracted reductions in trough seated bp of approximately
8–10/5–6mm hg. reductions in bp were maintained over a 24-hour period with
once-daily dosing. irbesartan reduced bp by 11–19/7–13mm hg in activecontrolled clinical trials compared with reductions of 8–18/5–14mm hg with the
comparator drugs. response rates with irbesartan were 36–72% compared with
43–68% for comparators.
irbesartan 150mg once daily produced significantly greater reductions in
diastolic and systolic bp and higher response and normalisation rates than
 xxxd3487xxx  80mg once daily in the only study involving both these agents to include
a statistical comparison. reductions in diastolic bp with irbesartan 150–300mg
once daily were greater than with losartan 50–100mg once daily, although the
effect on systolic bp was significantly greater for irbesartan in only 1 of 2 studies,
and there were no significant differences in response or normalisation rates
between the drugs. irbesartan 150mg once daily reduced diastolic bp to a lesser
extent than olmesartan 20mg once daily, but produced similar changes in systolic
bp and mean 24-hour ambulatory bp to olmesartan.
several trials have shown irbesartan to be as effective as enalapril 10–20mg
once daily in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, including in patients
aged ≥65 years. single studies have shown irbesartan 75–150mg once daily to
produce similar decreases in bp to atenolol 50–100mg once daily, and irbesartan
150mg once daily to be as effective as amlodipine 5mg once daily.
the combination of irbesartan 75–300mg once daily with hydrochlorothiazide
12.5–25mg once daily produced additive bp-lowering effects in patients with
mild-to-moderate hypertension. irbesartan 150mg combined with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg (both once daily) produced reductions in bp of 4–7/2–4mm hg
additional to those with the individual components. the combination reduced bp
in patients whose bp was unresponsive to monotherapy with irbesartan or
hydrochlorothiazide.
irbesartan induced regression of left ventricular mass in patients with left
ventricular hypertrophy in several trials. the reduction in left ventricular mass
was significantly greater with irbesartan than with amlodipine or atenolol, despite
reductions in bp being similar for irbesartan and the comparators.

therapeutic efficacy in
hypertensive patients
with type 2 diabetes
mellitus and
nephropathy

data from two large randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
[irbesartan microalbuminuria type 2 diabetes mellitus in hypertensive patients
(irma 2) and the irbesartan diabetic nephropathy trial (idnt)] showed that
irbesartan slowed the development of overt nephropathy and the progression of
renal disease in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, and suggested that the
renoprotective effect of irbesartan is at least in part independent of its bplowering effect.
in the irma 2 trial in patients with microalbuminuria (20–200 mug/min) and
normal kidney function, overt nephropathy developed in 5% of irbesartan 300mg
once daily recipients (p < 0.001 vs placebo), 10% of irbesartan 150mg once daily
recipients (not significant) and 15% of placebo recipients. the hazard ratio for

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

1003

diabetic nephropathy was 0.3 in recipients of irbesartan 300mg once daily but did
not achieve statistical significance in recipients of irbesartan 150mg once daily.
normoalbuminuria was restored in significantly more patients receiving
irbesartan 300mg, but not 150mg, once daily compared with placebo. the
renoprotective effect of irbesartan 300mg once daily was sustained in patients for
whom antihypertensive medication was withdrawn for 1 month after completing 2
years of treatment.
the average trough systolic but not diastolic bp was significantly lower for the
combined irbesartan groups than placebo (by 1–3mm hg). reductions in ambulatory bp, measured in a subset of patients, were similar between groups.
in patients with more advanced renal disease, including proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine levels (idnt), the relative risk of reaching the primary
endpoint (a composite measure of doubling of the serum creatinine level, endstage renal disease [esrd] or death) was significantly lower in recipients of
irbesartan 300mg once daily than placebo (by 20%) and amlodipine 10mg once
daily (by 23%). the relative risk of doubling of serum creatinine levels and the
rate at which serum creatinine levels increased were significantly lower in patients
receiving irbesartan than placebo or amlodipine recipients. the relative risk of
progression to esrd alone was 23% lower in irbesartan recipients than in placebo
or amlodipine recipients (not significant). the mean arterial bp in irbesartan
recipients was not significantly different to that in amlodipine recipients.
simulations of the long-term cost consequences of treatment with irbesartan,
based on the outcomes of the idnt, predicted that compared with amlodipine
over a 25-year (lifetime) horizon irbesartan would be associated with an increase
in life expectancy of 0.34–0.71 years and per-patient cost savings of
€21 163–27 044 in the belgian or french settings (year of costing 2002),
$us26 290 in the us (year of costing 2000) and $can19 976 in canada (year of
costing 2001).
tolerability

there was no clinically relevant difference between irbesartan ≤900mg/day and
placebo in the overall incidence of adverse drug events (21% vs 20%) in a pooled
analysis of nine placebo-controlled trials. the incidence of withdrawal because of
adverse events was 3.3% in irbesartan recipients and 4.5% in placebo recipients.
musculoskeletal trauma was the only adverse event to occur significantly more
frequently in recipients of irbesartan than placebo (1.9% vs 0.5%, p < 0.05).
analysis of tolerability data from five nonblind trials (mean duration 276 days)
involving 1006 patients with hypertension indicated that irbesartan monotherapy
(≤300mg once daily) was well tolerated. in this analysis, the incidence of adverse
drug experiences was 20% in recipients of irbesartan monotherapy, with 6% of
recipients of irbesartan monotherapy discontinuing because of adverse events.
the overall incidence of adverse events with irbesartan was similar to that of
most comparator agents. however, irbesartan was associated with a significantly
lower incidence of cough than enalapril and was not associated with ankle
oedema. the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide was also well
tolerated in patients with hypertension, with the overall incidence of adverse
events being similar to that for placebo.
in the irma 2 trial, serious adverse events occurred in fewer irbesartan than
placebo recipients (15% vs 23%). in the idnt, the rate of adverse events per 1000

treatment days was significantly lower in recipients of irbesartan than placebo or
amlodipine. the number of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse
event did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. significantly more
irbesartan patients (1.9%) withdrew because of hyperkalaemia than amlodipine
(0.5%) or placebo (0.4%) recipients. patients treated with irbesartan reported
more orthostatic symptoms than those receiving placebo.
irbesartan is approved for the treatment of hypertension in many countries
worldwide. in a number of countries, including the us, canada, australia and in
europe, it has also been approved for the treatment of nephropathy in patients with
type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
irbesartan may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive
agents. the usual starting dosage is 150mg administered once daily, and the
maximum recommended dosage for both indications is 300mg once daily, which
is also the recommended maintenance dosage for patients with diabetic nephropathy. irbesartan may be administered with or without food. no dosage adjustments
are necessary in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. dosage adjustments
are not usually necessary in elderly patients, but consideration may be given to
starting treatment at 75mg once daily in those aged >75 years. irbesartan should
not be administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

1. introduction
irbesartan (avapro®,  xxxd2382xxx ®)1 is a nonpeptide
 xxxg99xxx  receptor subtype 1 (at1) antagonist.
the pharmacological properties of oral irbesartan
and its clinical profile in patients with hypertension
are well established.[1,2] this review summarises the
pharmacological properties of oral irbesartan and its
clinical properties in patients with hypertension
(previously reviewed in drugs[1,2]), with particular
emphasis on its use in the management of nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus.
2. pharmacodynamic properties
 xxxg99xxx  antagonists act at the final step of
the renin-angiotensin system (figure 1) by selectively blocking the binding of  xxxg99xxx  to the at1
receptor. at1 receptors are located in the kidney,
heart, vascular smooth muscle cells, brain, adrenal
glands, platelets and adipocytes.[3-6] clinical effects
mediated by the at1 receptors include vasoconstriction, increases in sodium retention, endothe1

lin secretion, vasopressin release, vascular fibrosis,
stimulation of aldosterone production and release,
suppression of renin secretion, stimulation of  xxxg2058xxx  and activation of sympathetic activity.[3,4]
2.1 antagonism of at1
receptor-mediated activity
2.1.1 inhibition of the pressor effects of exogenous
 xxxg99xxx 

studies in normotensive volunteers indicate that
irbesartan exerts a long-lasting inhibitory effect on
the pressor response to exogenous  xxxg99xxx .[7-9]
in normotensive men (n = 42), single doses of
irbesartan 150–300mg produced a dose-dependent
inhibitory effect on the pressor response to  xxxg99xxx , with 100% inhibition from 2 to 4 hours after
drug administration.[9] twenty-four hours after administration of irbesartan 25–300mg, diastolic
blood pressure (bp) responses to  xxxg99xxx  were
still 30–70% reduced from baseline and the residual
effect was dose-dependent.[9]

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

2.1.2 hormonal effects

administration of irbesartan 5–300mg to healthy
volunteers[9-12] and hypertensive patients with normal renal function[13] or renal failure[14] induced a
significant dose-dependent compensatory increase
in plasma renin activity and  xxxg99xxx  levels in
randomised trials. for example, 24 hours after the
last dose of irbesartan 100mg once daily for 6
weeks, plasma renin activity increased from 0.43 to
1.26 mug • h/l (p < 0.05) in 20 patients with mild to
moderate hypertension and normal renal functioning.[13] plasma  xxxg99xxx  levels increased with
irbesartan from 2.2 to 5.9 fmol/l (p < 0.01).[13]
in 20 patients with hypertension, plasma aldosterone levels decreased from 59 at baseline to 44
ng/l 4 hours after the administration of the initial
irbesartan dose (p = 0.011).[13] however, in a study
in 42 normotensive volunteers, the effect of
irbesartan on plasma aldosterone levels was minimal.[9] plasma aldosterone levels tended to decrease
in the first few hours after administration of placebo

1005

or irbesartan 50–300mg; however, no consistent
time or dose relationship was observed.
2.1.3 comparison with other at1
receptor antagonists

two randomised, double-blind, crossover studies
have compared the  xxxg99xxx  antagonistic
properties of single or multiple doses of irbesartan
150mg,  xxxd3487xxx  80mg or losartan 50mg in healthy
volunteers.[7,8] effects were assessed according to in
vivo inhibition of the bp response to exogenous
 xxxg99xxx ,[7,8] in vitro at1 radioligand receptor
assay[7,8] or reactive changes in plasma angiotensin
ii levels.[8]
all three drugs inhibited the diastolic bp response to exogenous  xxxg99xxx .[7,8] this antagonistic effect was maximal at 4 hours after irbesartan
and  xxxd3487xxx  administration and  xxxd1891xxx  hours after
losartan administration in one study (n = 18).[7]
irbesartan produced a significantly greater response
(p < 0.05) than the other two drugs at 4, 24 and 30
hours in one trial (n = 12)[8] and at 36 hours in the
other.[7] in the latter trial,[7] the response with

irbesartan was also significantly greater than with
losartan at 4, 24 and 47 hours (p < 0.05). the
apparent half-lives of decay for this effect were
longer for both single and multiple doses of
irbesartan (15 and 18 hours, respectively) than for
losartan and  xxxd3487xxx  (approximately 8 hours).[7]
moreover, the reactive rise in plasma angiotensin
ii levels at 4 hours[8] and the in vitro percentage
receptor occupancy at all time points up to 30[8] and
47[7] hours were significantly higher with irbesartan
than the other drugs (p ≤ 0.05).
a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial (data
presented in three abstracts) has also compared the
 xxxg99xxx  antagonistic properties of irbesartan
150 mg/day with those of candesartan 8 mg/day in
healthy male volunteers (n = 18).[15-17] while both
irbesartan and candesartan showed a similar extent
and duration of antagonistic activity in vivo (assessed according to reactive changes in angiotensin
ii levels), higher antagonistic activity in plasma in
vitro/ex vivo was found for irbesartan (assessed by
the radioligand receptor assay) for up to 47 hours
after administration.[16] there was also a significantly greater (p = 0.03) reduction in plasma aldosterone
levels[15] and significantly greater (p = 0.02) increase in plasma renin activity[17] with irbesartan
than candesartan.
2.2 cardiovascular and
haemodynamic effects

in salt-replete normotensive volunteers (n = 42),
single doses of irbesartan 5–300mg had no significant effect on bp or heart rate,[9] whereas in 12
normotensive volunteers with salt-depletion (leading to activation of the renin-angiotensin system),
single doses of irbesartan 10–100mg produced doserelated decreases in supine and standing diastolic
and systolic bp; there was no significant change in
heart rate.[18]
in 12 normotensive volunteers with a high salt
intake (low-renin state), the reduction with irbesartan 150mg was similar to that with placebo; although dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with irbesartan and fosinopril 20mg significant© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

ly decreased bp compared with placebo (p <
0.05).[19]
the effects of once-daily irbesartan on bp in
patients with hypertension, with and without type 2
diabetes, and including those with left ventricular
hypertophy, are outlined in sections 4 and 5.
a study in patients with coronary artery disease
suggests that irbesartan has anti-inflammatory effects on vascular endothelium.[20] patients were
treated with aspirin and atorvastatin to achieve a
target cholesterol level; the subsequent addition of
irbesartan 150 mg/day significantly reduced monocyte binding in the vasculature and serum levels of
interleukin-6 compared with placebo (p < 0.005).
these effects, which were similar to those seen with
 xxxd3063xxx  20 mg/day, were independent of reductions in bp or cholesterol level.
2.3 renal effects

data from randomised, double-blind studies in
normotensive volunteers[10,11] and in patients with
hypertension[13] showed that irbesartan had positive
effects on renal parameters. in studies in healthy
volunteers, treatment with irbesartan 50mg (either
single dose or once daily) produced significant increases in renal blood flow and decreases in filtration fraction (p ≤ 0.05).[10,11] notably, there was no
significant change in glomerular filtration rate in
recipients of irbesartan in either study.[10,11]
similar effects on renal parameters were observed in a study in 20 patients with hypertension and
normal renal function that compared irbesartan 100
mg/day with enalapril 20 mg/day.[13] after 6 weeks’
treatment, both drugs tended to increase effective
renal blood flow and reduced renal vascular resistance, without a change in glomerular filtration rate.
the renal haemodynamic response appeared more
slowly, but persisted for longer (up to 24 hours), in
irbesartan than enalapril recipients.
the effects of irbesartan on renal parameters in
hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes are discussed in section 5.
irbesartan also induced a natriuretic response. a
single dose of irbesartan 50mg significantly increased sodium excretion in normotensive volundrugs 2004; 64 (9)

teers (p ≤ 0.05).[10,11,21] the natriuretic response was
still present after 8 days of irbesartan administration.[10] no change in potassium and  xxxd3472xxx  excretion were observed in these studies.
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic properties of single and/or
multiple doses of oral irbesartan have been investigated in healthy adults[12,22-24] and individuals with
renal impairment,[14] hepatic impairment[25] or heart
failure.[26]
3.1 absorption and distribution

the mean absolute oral bioavailability of
irbesartan (approximately 60–80% after an oral solution or capsule[22]) is unaffected by food.[27]
irbesartan is rapidly absorbed, with no apparent
accumulation after multiple doses (table i); peak
plasma concentrations (cmax) and area under the
concentration-time curve (auc) increased in a
dose-dependent, linear manner after single or multiple doses of irbesartan 150–600mg in volunteers.[12]
steady-state irbesartan concentrations were obtained within 3 days of once-daily administration to
volunteers.[12]
the degree of plasma protein binding of
irbesartan is ≥90%.[28,29] irbesartan has a steadystate volume of distribution of 53–93l in male volunteers.[22]
3.2 metabolism and excretion

irbesartan does not require biotransformation to
an active metabolite for activation.[23] after oral or
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

intravenous administration of [14c]-irbesartan to
volunteers, 76–88% of the plasma radioactivity was
attributable to unmetabolised irbesartan.[23] none of
the eight metabolites exceeded 9% of the plasma
radioactivity, and the pharmacological activity of
metabolites was minimal.[23]
irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by
both biliary and renal routes.[22] after administration
of an oral dose of [14c] irbesartan 150mg to 6
volunteers, 17% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine over a 48-hour collection period
and 54% of the total radioactivity was recovered in
the faeces over a 120-hour collection period.[23]
irbesartan and the eight metabolites accounted for
about 90% of the urinary radioactivity. the omega-1
hydroxylated metabolite of irbesartan accounted for
approximately 25% of the urinary radioactivity and
unmetabolised drug for <10%. about 30% of the
radioactivity recovered in the faeces corresponded
to unmetabolised irbesartan, with the eight metabolites accounting for the remainder.[23]
glucuronidation and oxidation are the major
routes of metabolism of irbesartan.[30,31] in vitro
studies show that the major route of oxidation of
irbesartan is via cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoform
2c9, and that metabolism by cyp3a4 is negligible.[31]
in volunteers, mean total plasma clearance of
irbesartan was approximately 9–11 l/h (157–176
ml/min), of which approximately 0.18 l/h (3 ml/
min) was renal clearance.[22] the elimination halflife of multiple doses of irbesartan 150 and 300mg
was 11 hours in volunteers.[12]
drugs 2004; 64 (9)

1008

3.3 effects of age and disease

irbesartan auc and cmax values were 43% and
49% higher in the elderly (≥65 years of age) than in
younger volunteers after a single dose of 50mg (p <
0.05);[24] however, the terminal elimination half-life
was not significantly different between the two age
groups. dosage modifications are generally not required in elderly patients (section 7). there was no
significant difference between men and women in
the pharmacokinetic profile of irbesartan.[24]
the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan
are not significantly altered in patients with mild-tosevere renal impairment (including haemodialysis
patients),[14] mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment[25] or heart failure.[26]
3.4 drug interactions

because irbesartan is metabolised primarily by
cyp2c9 (section 3.2), its effects on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolised by this isoform,
and vice versa, have been investigated.[32] in studies
conducted in volunteers, there was no significant
interaction between irbesartan and nifedipine,[33]
warfarin,[34] simvastatin[35] or  xxxd3394xxx .[36] fluconazole, a potent cyp2c9 inhibitor, increased the
steady-state auc of irbesartan by 63% and the cmax
by 19%.[37] concomitant administration of irbesartan and fluconazole did not alter the time to cmax at
steady state.
hydrochlorothiazide[38] and an antacid suspension of magnesium and  xxxd131xxx [39] did
not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of
irbesartan. multiple doses of irbesartan 150 mg/day
did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of
digoxin.[40]
4. therapeutic efficacy in hypertension
the bp-lowering efficacy of oral irbesartan once
daily in patients with mild-to-moderate essential
hypertension has been demonstrated in a number of
multicentre, double-blind, randomised, active-[41-50]
or placebo-controlled[51-59] studies of up to 24
weeks’ duration, both as monotherapy[41-54] and in
combination with hydrochlorothiazide.[55-59] one

croom et al.

trial evaluated patients with severe hypertension.[60]
open-label extension studies confirmed the continued efficacy of irbesartan[61] and irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide[62] over the longer term (12–24
months). additonal data come from a 4-week postmarketing surveillance study.[63]
the majority of studies enrolled patients with
seated
diastolic
bp
of
95–110mm
hg;[41-47,50,55,56,58,59] other studies used limits of
100–115,[49] 95–115[48] or 95–120mm hg,[57] and in
the study in severe hypertension,[60] patients were
included with a seated diastolic bp of 115–130mm
hg. all except a few studies[42,48,50,60] specifically
stated that patients had essential hypertension. all
antihypertensive agents were administered orally.
exclusion criteria generally included secondary
hypertension, significant cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction or other concomitant disease or
medication that could interfere with assessments.
the primary efficacy parameter in most studies
was the reduction in trough seated diastolic bp.
response was generally defined as diastolic bp
<90mm hg (normalisation) or a reduction in diastolic bp of ≥10mm hg from baseline.
two studies included in the section on monotherapy (section 4.1) allowed add-on therapy in patients
who did not have an adequate response to single
agents;[48,50] however, the primary endpoint was assessed prior to the use of adjunctive therapy. studies
in which the primary endpoint was assessed after the
addition of adjunctive therapy are reviewed in section 4.2.
4.1 monotherapy

early randomised, placebo-controlled studies
showed that irbesartan 75–300mg once daily for
6–12 weeks led to significantly (p < 0.01) greater
reductions in both diastolic and systolic bp than
placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.[51-53] decreases in bp were apparent within 2
weeks of commencing treatment,[51-53] with maximum reductions being achieved after 2–6 weeks,[52]
and were dose-related, plateauing above 300mg
daily.[54] irbesartan 150–300mg once daily produced
placebo-subtracted reductions in trough seated bp
drugs 2004; 64 (9)

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

of approximately 8–10/5–6mm hg.[54] studies involving ambulatory bp measurements have confirmed that irbesartan maintains control of bp over
24 hours.[43,46] a trough-to-peak ratio of at least 0.6
was generally achieved with once-daily dosages of
150mg or above.[49,54]
in randomised clinical trials against active comparators (table ii), once-daily irbesartan was as effective at reducing bp as enalapril,[41-44] atenolol[50]
and amlodipine.[45] it was significantly more effective than  xxxd3487xxx  in the only trial that statistically
compared the efficacy of these two drugs,[46] and at
least as effective at reducing trough diastolic bp as
once-daily losartan,[47,48] but less effective at reducing diastolic bp than olmesartan[49] (table ii). response rates with irbesartan 150–300mg once daily
were 36–72% compared with 43–68% for comparator agents (table ii).
irbesartan 150mg once daily was significantly
more effective than  xxxd3487xxx  80mg once daily for
both absolute reduction in bp (diastolic and systolic) and response rate (including normalisation rate)
as assessed by mean seated bp (table ii) and ambulatory bp, in one trial.[46] mean reduction in ambulatory diastolic bp at trough (the primary efficacy
parameter) was 7mm hg for irbesartan versus 5mm
hg for  xxxd3487xxx  (p = 0.035). in another trial, reductions in bp with irbesartan 150mg once daily and
 xxxd3487xxx  80mg once daily were 11/10mm hg and 8/
8mm hg; however, statistical comparisons were not
performed.[49]
irbesartan 300mg once daily was significantly
more effective than losartan 100mg once daily in
terms of absolute reduction in trough diastolic and
systolic bp (table ii), but not response (table ii) or
normalisation rate, in a fixed-dose trial.[47] in the
same study, the reduction in bp and the response
rate with irbesartan 150mg once daily were similar
to those achieved with losartan 100mg once daily.
in a study in which doses were titrated according
to response, the change from baseline in diastolic bp
after 8 weeks’ monotherapy was significantly greater (by 2mm hg) in patients receiving irbesartan
150–300mg once daily than losartan 50–100mg
once daily (table ii).[48] differences in systolic bp

and response rates (including normalisation) were
not significant. moreover, after a further 4 weeks,
when add-on therapy was allowed, significantly
greater effects on both diastolic and systolic bp, and
also response rate, were reported for the irbesartan
group compared with those receiving losartan (table
ii). it should be noted that when hydrochlorothiazide was added to losartan, the dosage of losartan
was reduced to 50mg once daily.[48]
recipients of olmesartan 20mg once daily had a
significantly greater reduction (by approximately
2mm hg) in seated diastolic bp than patients who
received irbesartan 150mg once daily after 8 weeks’
treatment (table ii).[49] however, there was no significant between-group difference in the effect on
systolic bp (table ii), nor for change in mean
24-hour ambulatory bp, assessed as a secondary
parameter (11/7 vs 13/9mm hg).[49]
a number of studies of 8–12 weeks’ duration
have shown that in terms of absolute reduction in bp
and response rates, irbesartan 150–300mg once
daily shows similar efficacy to enalapril 10–20mg
once daily in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, including those aged ≥65 years;[41,43,44] another study found irbesartan 75–300mg once daily
to be similar to enalapril 10–40mg once daily[42]
(table ii). where assessed, irbesartan and enalapril
also produced similar reductions in mean 24-hour
ambulatory bp.[43,44] for example, in one trial for
which it was the primary efficacy parameter, mean
reductions in 24-hour bp were 15/9mm hg with
irbesartan versus 13/9mm hg with enalapril; the
response rate based on ambulatory bp was 71% for
both groups.[43]
in a longer-term study, in which dose titration
was allowed from week 6 and add-on therapy from
week 12, irbesartan 75–150mg once daily and atenolol 50–100mg once daily showed similar efficacy
at both 12 weeks (on monotherapy) and 24 weeks
(after add-on therapy was allowed) [table ii].[50]
in a 4-week, open-label, practice-based postmarketing surveillance study involving 7314 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (baseline
seated diastolic bp 90–115mm hg) treated with
irbesartan 150mg once daily, the mean reduction in

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

bp was 16/9mm hg at the end of treatment, and the
response rate was 77%.[63] subgroup analysis indicated that age, race and sex had no effect on the
extent of bp reduction, but patients with a baseline
diastolic bp >110mm hg had the greatest reduction
in diastolic bp (21mm hg).
long-term efficacy data (≥12 months) are available for 821 patients from a pooled analysis of five
open-label extension studies, during which irbesartan was started at a dosage of 75mg once daily
(150mg once daily in one study) and titrated to a
maximum of 300mg once daily.[61] if a target bp of
140/90mm hg was not achieved, additional antihypertensive agents were added, most commonly
hydrochlorothiazide.
after 12 months, the mean reduction in seated bp
from baseline (155/101mm hg) was 21/16mm hg
and bp had been normalised in 83% of patients.[61]
of these patients, 64% were receiving irbesartan
monotherapy and 21% were receiving irbesartan
plus hydrochlorothiazide. at 24 months (130 evaluable patients), the mean bp reduction was 17/15mm
hg.
4.1.1 pharmacogenetic analyses

pharmacogenetic analyses have found that reductions in diastolic bp after 12 weeks’ treatment with
irbesartan were significantly greater in hypertensive
patients who were homozygous for the angiotensin
converting enzyme i allele (ii genotype) than in
those who had the id or dd genotype (p =
0.0096).[64] in contrast, systolic bp reductions were
related to  xxxg572xxx  ( xxxg572xxx )-344 c/t
polymorphism, with a significantly greater decrease
in systolic bp seen in patients with the tt genotype
than with tc or cc variants (p = 0.04).[65]
4.2 in combination with other
antihypertensive drugs
4.2.1 add-on therapy

a substantial number of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent
for adequate control of their bp.[66]
in two trials in patients with mild-to-moderate
hypertension (discussed in section 4.1), in which the

primary endpoint was assessed at the end of a period
of monotherapy, subsequent adjunctive therapy with
hydrochlorothiazide or nifedipine produced further
reductions in bp compared with those achieved with
monotherapy with irbesartan or comparator agents
(see table ii).[48,50] in one of these studies, a comparison between irbesartan 75–150mg once daily and
atenolol 50–100mg once daily[50] (section 4.1), 28%
of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension receiving irbesartan and 36% of those receiving atenolol required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to
achieve adequate control of bp. in a further 3–5% of
patients, adjunctive therapy with both nifedipine and
hydrochlorothiazide was needed.[50]
two placebo-controlled studies showed that the
combination of irbesartan with hydrochlorothiazide
can reduce bp in patients in whom it is not adequately controlled by monotherapy with
irbesartan[58] or hydrochlorothiazide[57] (table iii).
add-on therapy with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg
once daily for 2 weeks produced further reductions
in bp compared with those achieved after 8 weeks
of irbesartan monotherapy (table iii).[58] with the
combination of irbesartan 300mg once daily plus
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg once daily, an additional decrease in bp of approximately 9/5mm hg was
seen compared to the reduction achieved with
irbesartan 300mg alone (statistical analysis not reported) [table iii]. the addition of irbesartan
75–150mg once daily to hydrochlorothiazide 25mg
once daily for 8 weeks in patients not adequately
controlled by 4 weeks’ treatment with hydrochlorothiazide alone[57] led to a significantly greater reduction in bp from baseline than that seen with placebo/
hydrochlorothiazide (by approximately 12/7mm hg,
p < 0.01 [table iii]), and a significantly higher
percentage of patients whose bp was normalised
(67% vs 29%, p < 0.01).
the combination of irbesartan 300mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg once daily for 12 weeks led to
significant reductions in both sitting and ambulatory
mean bp in patients with hypertension previously
uncontrolled by single agent treatment with standard
antihypertensive drugs (e.g. calcium channel antagonists, ace inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor

enalapril (n = 61), the efficacy of the two regimens
was similar at the end of the study (12 weeks), when
the primary endpoint was assessed. reductions in
bp and response rates were 40/30mm hg and 100%
versus 39/31mm hg and 98% for the irbesartan- and
enalapril-based regimens.[60]
4.2.2 combination therapy
with hydrochlorothiazide

studies in which the primary objective was to
compare the efficacy of irbesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide with placebo and/or monotherapy with one
or both agents are reviewed here.[55,56,59] see section
4.2.1 for discussion of studies of add-on therapy
with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide in patients
refractory to monotherapy with one of these drugs
alone.[57,58]
the bp-lowering effects of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide were additive and dose-dependent in
an 8-week, double-blind, dose-ranging study in
which 683 patients were randomised to receive one
of sixteen combinations of irbesartan 37.5–300mg
once daily or placebo and hydrochlorothiazide
6.25–25mg once daily or placebo.[59]
two studies showed that the combination of
irbesartan with hydrochlorothiazide reduces bp to a
greater extent than placebo[55,56] or either drug
alone,[55] in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (table iii). irbesartan 75 or 150mg once
daily plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg once daily
produced significantly greater mean reductions from
baseline compared with placebo in both seated
trough bp (table iii)[55,56] and 24-hour ambulatory
bp (22/12 vs 22/14 vs 6/4mm hg, both p < 0.01).[56]
daytime (12-hour) ambulatory bp reductions were
only slightly greater than the 24-hour values, indicating that the combination achieved sustained bp
control over the full dosage interval.[56]
in a large study in patients with mild-to-moderate
hypertension (reported as an abstract), irbesartan 75
or 150mg once daily in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg once daily produced significantly greater reductions in bp than any individual
component administered alone (table iii).[55] the
percentage of patients whose bp was normalised

(56% and 59%) was significantly greater than seen
with placebo (30%, both p < 0.01), but not compared
with either irbesartan 150 or 75mg once daily or
hydrochlorothiazide administered alone (39%, 35%
and 33%, respectively).
a long-term, open-label, extension of two
double-blind studies (studies not specifically identified; n = 1098) showed that after 12 months’ treatment with irbesartan 75–300mg once daily plus
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25mg once daily (with
the addition of adjunctive therapy if necessary [18%
of patients]), bp was normalised in 83% of patients.[62]
4.3 effects on left ventricular hypertrophy

left ventricular hypertrophy is a recognised risk
factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[68-70] irbesartan induced regression of left ventricular mass (lvm) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy
in several randomised, comparative trials.[71-74] all
trials were double-blind, except for one which used
an open-label, blinded-endpoint design.[74]
after 6 months’ treatment in 40 patients, irbesartan reduced lvm by 19g from a baseline of 121g (p
< 0.05); the reduction seen with enalapril in this trial
was 15g (from 123g, p < 0.05).[71] this study was
presented as an abstract; dosages and betweengroup statistical comparisons were not reported.
irbesartan 150–300mg once daily for 6 months
led to a significantly greater reduction in mean lvm
index (lvmi) than amlodipine 5–10mg once daily
in a study in 60 patients.[74] this was despite there
being no significant difference in the effect on bp
between the two drugs (reduction from baseline
18/22mm hg for irbesartan vs 15/19mm hg for
amlodipine). baseline lvmis were 141 and 138
g/m2 for irbesartan and amlodipine; adjusted mean
reductions from baseline at 6 months were 35 g/m2
(25%) and 18 g/m2 (13%), with an adjusted mean
difference of approximately 12% in favour of
irbesartan (p < 0.0001).[74]
irbesartan induced a greater reduction in lvm
than atenolol in two studies in patients with hypertension.[72,73] in the larger of the two studies,[73]
drugs 2004; 64 (9)

1014

irbesartan 150–300mg once daily or atenolol
50–100mg once daily were administered to 115
patients with left ventricular hypertrophy for 48
weeks; from 12 and 24 weeks onwards, hydrochlorothiazide and  xxxd2092xxx , respectively, could be added if necessary (and were required by similar proportions of patients in both groups). baseline mean
lvmi was 154 and 144 g/m2 for the irbesartan and
atenolol groups. mean reductions in lvmi at 12, 24
and 48 weeks for patients receiving irbesartan were
9, 14 and 26 g/m2, respectively, and for atenolol
were 1, 7 and 14 g/m2. the difference was statistically significant at week 48 (reductions of 17% vs
10%, p = 0.024).[73] bp reductions were similar in
both treatment groups. there was a significant relationship between decreases in lvmi and reduction
in systolic, but not diastolic, bp for both groups (p ≤
0.05).
4.3.1 cardiac repolarisation in left
ventricular hypertrophy

in patients with hypertension and left ventricular
hypertrophy, irbesartan 150–300mg once daily reduced qt and qtc dispersion to a greater extent
than atenolol 50–100mg once daily.[75] after 48
weeks’ treatment, qt dispersion had decreased
from 56 to 45 ms and qtc dispersion from 57 to
24ms in patients treated with irbesartan (p < 0.001
for both parameters for change from baseline),
whereas there was little change in the atenolol group
(p = 0.001 and p = 0.011 for irbesartan vs atenolol).
5. therapeutic efficacy in hypertensive
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
and nephropathy
irbesartan has been studied in the management of
diabetic nephropathy in patients with hypertension
and type 2 diabetes. data from an early pilot study
first suggested that patients with hypertension, type
2 diabetes and nephropathy may benefit from treatment with irbesartan.[76] following treatment for 12
weeks, patients receiving irbesartan showed a 9%
decrease in urinary protein excretion, while in those
receiving amlodipine, urinary protein excretion increased by 20%.

croom et al.

following on from this small study, the program
for irbesartan mortality and morbidity evaluation
(prime) was established. this program consists of
two fully published, large (n >500), randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that have further investigated the use of irbesartan in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.[77,78] the irbesartan microalbuminuria type 2
diabetes in hypertensive patients (irma 2) trial[77]
evaluated the efficacy of irbesartan in the treatment
of patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension
with early stages of renal damage (microalbuminuria). in the irbesartan diabetic nephropathy trial
(idnt),[78] irbesartan was evaluated in patients with
type 2 diabetes and hypertension with established
renal disease (proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine levels).
patients in the irma 2 trial and the idnt had a
mean systolic bp >135mm hg or a mean diastolic
bp >85mm hg, or both, and were aged 30–70 (mean
58) years. in both studies, the target bp goal was
≤135/85mm hg at 3 months and additional antihypertensives (but not ace inhibitors, other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists or dihydropyridine
calcium channel antagonists) were permitted. patients continued with their usual antidiabetic medication. analysis was according to intention-to-treat
principles.
in addition to irma2, data on the effect of
irbesartan on microalbuminuria in patients with type
2 diabetes are available from a small randomised,
double-blind, crossover study in which irbesartan or
placebo was administered to both hypertensive and
normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria for two periods of 60 days.[79]
5.1 patients with microalbuminuria

the irma 2 trial included 590 hypertensive
patients with type 2 diabetes (according to who
criteria), microalbuminuria (20–200 mug/min [1.2–12
mg/h]) and a normal serum creatinine concentration.[77] the mean baseline glycosylated haemoglobin (hba1c) was 7.2%. patients were randomised
to placebo (n = 201), irbesartan 150mg once
daily (n = 195) or irbesartan 300mg once daily (n =

additional antihypertensive drugs were administered to 56%, 45% and 43% of recipients of placebo,
irbesartan 150mg once daily and irbesartan 300mg
once daily, respectively.
the primary outcome for the irma 2 trial was
the time from baseline to the first detection of overt
nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion rate >200
mug/min [12 mg/h] and at least 30% higher than at
baseline on at least two consecutive occasions).[77]
ten (5%) of the patients receiving irbesartan 300mg
once daily, 19 (10%) receiving irbesartan 150mg
once daily and 30 (15%) receiving placebo reached
the primary endpoint (table iv); the between-group
difference was significant for irbesartan 300mg
once daily versus placebo (p < 0.001). the unadjusted hazard ratio for diabetic nephropathy was 0.61
(95% ci 0.34, 1.08, not significant) in recipients of
irbesartan 150mg once daily and 0.30 (95% ci 0.14,
0.61, p < 0.001) in recipients of irbesartan 300mg
once daily.[77]
the level of urinary albumin excretion was reduced to a significantly greater extent in recipients
of irbesartan 300mg once daily than in recipients of
irbesartan 150mg once daily (figure 2).[77] the restoration of normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin excre© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

tion <20 mug/min [1.2 mg/h]) occurred in 34% of
recipients of irbesartan 300mg once daily (p = 0.006
vs placebo), 24% of recipients of irbesartan 150mg
once daily and 21% of placebo recipients. in all
three treatment groups, the initial drop in creatinine
clearance that occurred in the first 3 months of the
study was greater than the sustained decline from 3
to 24 months. however, there were no significant
between-group differences in the initial or sustained
rate of decline in creatinine clearance.[77]
the average trough bp through the study in
recipients of irbesartan 300mg once daily, irbesartan
150mg once daily and placebo was 141/83, 143/83
and 144/83mm hg, respectively (p = 0.004 for the
comparison of systolic bp between the combined
irbesartan groups and placebo).[77] in a subgroup of
43 patients in whom ambulatory bp monitoring was
performed,[80] reductions in 24-hour ambulatory bp
after 2 years were similar in all three groups (7/8, 5/7
and 11/10mm hg for irbesartan 300 or 150mg once
daily and placebo, respectively); there were also no
significant differences in the effect on night or day
ambulatory bp.
glycaemic control was similar in all groups, with
hba1c levels increasing by 0.3% in placebo recipients and by 0.4% in irbesartan recipients.[77]

of 2 years.[77] the target blood pressure was <135/85mm hg at 3

dihydropyridines) and alpha-blockers. * p < 0.001 vs pl; † p < 0.001 vs

after completing 2 years of treatment in the
irma 2 trial, 133 patients had all antihypertensive
medication withdrawn for 1 month, as part of a
substudy.[81] compared with baseline, there was a
significant sustained reduction in urinary albumin
excretion rate in the irbesartan 300mg once daily
group (47%, p < 0.05), while there were nonsignificant increases of 11% and 14% in the irbesartan
150mg and placebo groups. the difference between
the two irbesartan groups occurred despite there
being similar increases in mean bp and glomerular
filtration rates in both dosage groups during the
1-month period.
in the small, crossover study,[79] the albumin
excretion rate was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced
compared with baseline in both the hypertensive
(n = 64) and normotensive (n = 60) groups receiving
irbesartan 150mg twice daily (placebo-subtracted
reductions of 31–32 mug/min and 29–35 mug/min);
whereas mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic bp
were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced in the hypertensive patients only (placebo-subtracted reductions

the idnt included 1715 hypertensive patients
with type 2 diabetes with proteinuria (≥900 mg/day)
and elevated serum creatinine levels (1.2–3 mg/dl
[106–265 mumol/l] in men and 1–3 mg/dl [88–265
mumol/l] in women).[78] mean baseline hba1c was
8.2%. patients were randomised to irbesartan (titrated to 300mg once daily; n = 579), amlodipine (titrated to 10mg once daily; n = 567) or placebo (n = 569)
and were followed for a minimum of 2 years (mean
2.6 years). the mean number of additional antihypertensive drugs required to achieve the target bp
was 3.3, 3.0 and 3.0 for the placebo, irbesartan and
amlodipine recipients, respectively.
the primary endpoint was a composite measure
of doubling of the baseline serum creatinine level,
the onset of end-stage renal disease (esrd) or death
from any cause.[78] esrd was indicated by the
initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation, or a serum creatinine of ≥6 mg/dl (530 mumol/l). the
secondary cardiovascular endpoint was a composite
measure of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure resulting in
hospitalisation, a permanent neurological deficit
caused by a cerebrovascular event, or lower limb
amputation below the ankle.[78]
the primary composite endpoint was reached by
33% of irbesartan recipients, 41% of amlodipine
recipients and 39% of placebo recipients (table
iv).[78] the unadjusted (for mean arterial bp) relative risk of reaching the primary endpoint with
irbesartan was 20% lower than with placebo (p =
0.02) and 23% lower than with amlodipine (p =
0.006).
irbesartan was also significantly more effective
than amlodipine or placebo for one of the three
individual endpoints making up the composite. the
unadjusted relative risk of doubling of the serum
creatinine level was 33% lower in irbesartan than
placebo recipients (p = 0.003) and 37% lower in
irbesartan than amlodipine recipients (p < 0.001).

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

when esrd alone was analysed, the unadjusted
relative risk was 23% lower in the irbesartan than
the placebo or amlodipine recipients, but the between-group difference was not statistically significant.[78] there were also no significant betweengroup differences in the relative risk of death from
any cause or in the secondary composite cardiovascular endpoint.[78] however, there was a statistically significant lower incidence of congestive heart
failure (one of the components of the cardiovascular
composite endpoint) in patients who received
irbesartan than in either placebo recipients (hazard
ratio 0.72, p = 0.048) or amlodipine recipients (hazard ratio 0.65, p = 0.004).[82]
serum creatinine levels increased 24% more
slowly in irbesartan than placebo recipients (p =
0.008) and 21% more slowly than in recipients of
amlodipine (p = 0.02) [mean annual rate of change
0.45 vs 0.57 vs 0.59 mg/dl/year for irbesartan,
amlodipine and placebo, respectively].[78] the mean
annual rate of change of creatinine clearance was
–5.5 ml/min/1.73m2/year (–0.33 l/h/1.73m2/year)
in irbesartan recipients, –6.8 ml/min/1.73m2/year
(–0.41 l/h/1.73m2/year) in amlodipine recipients
and –6.5 ml/min/1.73m2/year (–0.39 l/h/1.73m2/
year) in placebo recipients. proteinuria was reduced
by 33% in irbesartan recipients, 6% in amlodipine
recipients and 10% in placebo recipients.[78] statistical analyses were not reported for rate of change in
creatinine clearance or proteinuria.
the mean bp during the study in recipients of
irbesartan, amlodipine and placebo was 140/77,
141/77 and 144/80mm hg, respectively.[78] the
mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in
placebo recipients than that in irbesartan and
amlodipine recipients (p = 0.001 for both comparisons); the mean arterial bp in irbesartan recipients
was not significantly different from that in
amlodipine recipients. although target systolic bp
was not achieved in any of the treatment groups, the
mean systolic bp achieved during the study represented a decrease of 20, 18 and 14mm hg from
baseline for irbesartan, amlodipine and placebo, respectively.[78]

5.2.1 pharmacoeconomic evaluations

the long-term cost consequences of the use of
irbesartan have been evaluated for belgium,[83]
france,[83] the us[84] and canada[85] using markov
modelling based on the outcomes of the idnt. the
canadian study also included a probabilistic analysis using monte carlo simulation techniques.[85]
the perspective was that of a third-party payer for
european countries[83] and canada[85] and that of a
healthcare system for the us.[84] treatment-specific
probablities were derived from the idnt, and country-specific data on medication costs and end-stage
renal disease came from published sources. the year
of costing was 2002 for the european studies[83],
2001 for canada[85] and 2000 for the us;[84] future
costs were discounted at 3%[83,84] or 5%[85] per annum.
all of the models found that irbesartan improved
life expectancy and was associated with cost savings
in comparison with amlodipine or control therapy
over 10- and 25-year horizons (only 25-year horizon
evaluated in the canadian study) [table v].[83-85]
irbesartan was also dominant based on the monte
carlo simulation.[85] sensitivity analyses confirmed
the robustness of the results. the european analyses
reported that most of the cost savings with irbesartan
were due to a reduction in esrd-associated
costs.[83] cost savings with irbesartan compared
with amlodipine were predicted to start after approximately 3 years of treatment.[83,84]
a cost-benefit analysis of direct costs based on
the idnt, performed in a german setting and reported as an abstract, also predicted that irbesartan
would be associated with cost savings.[86]

irbesartan is well tolerated in patients with mildto-moderate hypertension. analysis of pooled tolerability data from nine double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (mean treatment duration 9 weeks)

(21% vs 20%).[87] the incidence of adverse events
occurring in ≥1% of irbesartan recipients and at a
higher incidence than in placebo recipients based on
this pooled analysis are shown in figure 3;[88] none
of these adverse events occurred at an incidence
greater than 5%.[88] the analysis included data from
417 patients who received irbesartan 600 or 900 mg/
day (above the maximum approved dosage); however, there was no relationship between increasing
dose and incidence of adverse events, and the incidence at these higher dosages was similar to that
with 150 or 300 mg/day.[87]
musculoskeletal trauma was the only adverse
event reported in significantly more irbesartan recipients than placebo recipients (1.9% vs 0.5%, p <
0.05) [figure 3].[88] the incidence of all other adverse events (reported without regard to causality)
was similar in irbesartan and placebo recipients.[88]
there were no reports of angioedema and the incidence of serious adverse events was similar in
irbesartan and placebo recipients (1.0% vs 1.9%).[87]

in 3.3% of irbesartan and 4.5% of placebo recipients.[87]

therapy (≤300mg once daily) was well tolerated in
the long term (mean 276 days).[61] the incidence of
adverse drug experiences in patients receiving
irbesartan monotherapy was 20%, with 6% of patients discontinuing because of adverse events (reported without regard to causality). adverse drug
events which occurred in ≥5% of patients receiving
irbesartan monotherapy in these trials included upper respiratory tract infection (11%), musculoskeletal pain (10%), headache (6%), dizziness (5%) and
cough (5%).
in an open-label, post-marketing surveillance
study reported as an abstract,[63] in which patients
received irbesartan 150 mg/day for 4 weeks, 14% of
9009 patients experienced adverse events. most
were mild in severity, with dizziness (1.9%) and
headache (1.8%) being the most common events.
serious adverse events were reported by 0.9% of
patients.
in the clinical trials reviewed in section 4, the
overall incidence of adverse events with irbesartan
was similar to that of most comparator agents, including other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists,[46-49] atenolol[50] and enalapril.[41-44,60] however,
in four of five studies comparing the two agents, the
incidence of cough was lower with irbesartan than
enalapril (overall ranges 1–10% vs 8–17%);[41-43,60]

one study comparing irbesartan with amlodipine
found a similar incidence of adverse events in both
groups.[45] however, in a 6-month trial in patients
with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy,
there were numerically fewer drug-related adverse
events in the irbesartan than the amlodipine group
(3% vs 17%), and irbesartan was not associated with
ankle oedema, whereas the incidence in patients
treated with amlodipine was 13% (statistical analysis not reported).[74]

occurred in fewer irbesartan than placebo recipients
(15% vs 23%, p = 0.02). in the idnt,[78] the rate of

hyperkalaemia than amlodipine (0.5%) or placebo
(0.4%) recipients. in both trials,[77,78] the overall
incidence of discontinuation of study medication
was similar in recipients of irbesartan and its comparators (e.g. 14.9% vs 18.9% in the irbesartan and
placebo groups in the irma 2 trial[77]).
in both the idnt and irma 2 trials, the adverse
event profile was generally similar to that in patients
with only hypertension,[90] with the exception that in
the idnt orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension) occurred
at a numerically higher frequency in patients treated
with irbesartan than in placebo recipients (10% vs
6%, 5% vs 3% and 5% vs 3%, respectively; statistical analysis not reported).[88]
7. dosage and administration
this section is based on the us prescribing information;[90] the information is the same as that in the
european summary of product characteristics
(spc),[88] except where otherwise indicated. irbesartan is approved in many countries worldwide for use
in the treatment of hypertension[91] (the european
spc specifies ‘essential hypertension’[88]). it can be
used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents,[90] and tablets containing fixed-dose
combinations of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide[89] are available. in a number of countries, including the us, canada, europe and australia,
irbesartan has also been approved for the treatment
of nephropathy in patients with hypertension and
type 2 diabetes;[88,90,92,93] the european spc specifies that in this indication, irbesartan should be used
as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.[88]
the usual recommended starting dosage for
irbesartan is 150mg once daily; the dosage can be
increased to the maximum recommended dosage of
300mg once daily if necessary.[90] the recommended maintenance dosage for the treatment of nephropathy in hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients is
300mg once daily.[90]
irbesartan may be administered with or without
food.[90] in general, no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with hepatic or renal impairment;
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

croom et al.

however, a starting dosage of 75mg once daily
should be considered in patients undergoing
haemodialysis.[90] the us prescribing information
states that dosage adjustments are not necessary in
elderly patients,[90] while the the european spc says
that although dosage adjustment is not usually necessary in the elderly, consideration should be given
to initiating therapy at 75mg in those aged over 75
years.[88] volume- or salt-depletion should be
corrected prior to administering irbesartan.[90]
irbesartan should not be administered during the
second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and
should be discontinued as soon as possible after
pregnancy is detected.[90]
8. place of irbesartan in the
management of hypertension and
diabetic nephropathy
irbesartan is an at1 antagonist, which combines
antihypertensive efficacy (section 4) with a favourable tolerability profile (section 6), and also exerts a
renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes and nephropathy (section 5).
hypertension is an important risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and is estimated to cause 7.1
million premature deaths per year and account for
4.4% of the global disease burden.[94] treating hypertension has been associated with a 16% reduction
in the risk of coronary heart disease and a 38%
reduction in the risk of stroke.[95] target bp is
generally recommended to be <140/90mm hg for
most patients, and <130/80mm hg for patients with
diabetes[96-98] or chronic renal failure.[98] although
lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation,
weight reduction and dietary measures can help
reduce bp, many patients need pharmacological
therapy in addition.[96-98]
since the major classes of antihypertensive
agents (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, alpha-blockers, ace inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists) provide broadly similar
antihypertensive efficacy,[96,97] the choice of therapy
may be influenced by other factors, such as cost,
adverse effects in individual patients and the presdrugs 2004; 64 (9)

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

ence of concomitant diseases or target organ damage.[96-98]
the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan is
similar to that of enalapril, and, based on single
trials, amlodipine and atenolol (section 4.1). based
on the single study including a statistical comparison, irbesartan was more effective than  xxxd3487xxx ,
while in another trial irbesartan was less effective at
reducing diastolic bp than olmesartan (although
similar to olmesartan in its effect on systolic bp)
[section 4.1]. irbesartan provides better control of
trough diastolic bp than losartan administered on a
once-daily basis and similar or greater efficacy than
losartan for systolic bp (section 4.1). irbesartan
administered once daily provides control of bp
throughout the 24-hour dosing interval; minimising
blood pressure variation in this way may help protect against the development of end-organ damage.[99,100]
irbesartan is generally well tolerated (section 6).
the incidence of adverse events in clincial trials was
similar to that for other  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists. irbesartan was associated with a lower
incidence of cough than enalapril (p ≤ 0.05), so it
may be useful in patients who find this a problem
with ace inhibitor treatment, and it is not associated with peripheral oedema, in contrast to
amlodipine. the efficacy of irbesartan in hypertension is not affected by age or sex (section 4.1). no
data comparing the antihypertensive effect of
irbesartan in black and white patients have been
published; however the us prescribing information
indicates that, although effective at reducing bp
regardless of race, the effect was less in black
patients.[90]
there is evidence that specific classes of drug
may provide an advantage in terms of major disease
endpoints in certain patient populations, and this
may guide the choice of therapy for particular patients.[96-98] guidelines from the who cite the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy as an indication
for the use of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor,[96] including  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists,
since losartan was found to be more effective than a

beta-blocker at reducing cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality in this group of patients.[101,102]
while mortality data for irbesartan are not available, it has been shown to reduce left ventricular
mass in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy to a greater extent than atenolol
(section 4.3). one study also showed that compared
with atenolol, irbesartan significantly reduced qt
and qtc dispersion in patients with left ventricular
hypertrophy (section 4.3.1), which could potentially
reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and fatal
events in these patients.[75]
in addition, most guidelines, including those
from the american diabetes association, now
recommend  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists as
suitable for first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.[96-98]
by the year 2010 approximately 221 million people worldwide are expected to have diabetes.[103]
type 2 diabetes is estimated to account for approximately 97% of the cases of the disease.[103] the
prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (a progressive
microvascular complication of diabetes) varies between countries, with values of 2–40% being reported.[103] of concern is the prevalence of esrd, the
incidence of which is increasing worldwide.[104] in
the us, for example, diabetes was the most common
cause of esrd, accounting for 43% of cases reported between 1995 and 1999.[105] therefore, detection
of the early stages of renal nephropathy and subsequent renoprotective treatment are important for
patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on declining renal function has been demonstrated in hypertensive patients with type 1 diabetes and
overt nephropathy,[106,107] and also in the prevention
and progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients
with type 2 diabetes[108-110] (also see reviews[111-113]).
consequently, recent guidelines have emphasised
the importance of aggressive bp reduction in diabetic patients.[96-98,114-118] a bp goal of <130/80mm
hg is currently recommended by most guidelines as
the optimal target for hypertensive patients with
diabetes.[96-98,115,117] the appropriate target bp for
hypertensive patients with diabetes and incipient or
drugs 2004; 64 (9)

1022

overt nephropathy has been a point of controversy;[119] nevertheless, some guidelines have recommended a bp goal of 125/75mm hg if proteinuria
(>1 g/day) is present.[97,118]
emerging data show that agents capable of the
blockade of the renin-angiotensin system have a
specific renoprotective effect[120] and therefore represent a rational choice of antihypertensive therapy
in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
originally, ace inhibitors were investigated for
potential renoprotective effects,[121-129] which were
found to be beyond those attributable to bp reduction.[130-132]
data from three large randomised, double-blind
long-term trials,[77,78,133] supported by earlier
work,[76-78,123,125,133,134] show that  xxxg100xxx  inhibitors improve renal outcomes in hypertensive
patients with type 2 diabetes at the early or later
stages of diabetic nephropathy. moreover, data from
these trials (irma 2,[77] idnt[78] and the reduction
of endpoints in non-insulin dependent diabetes
with the  xxxg99xxx  antagonist losartan
[renaal][133]) indicated that improvements in renal outcome were beyond those attributable solely to
bp control, a finding also supported by a shorterterm study evaluating  xxxd3487xxx .[135]
consequently, the american diabetes association now recommends both ace inhibitors and at1
receptor antagonists as first-line therapy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, and  xxxg100xxx  antagonists in those patients with macroalbuminuria/nephropathy.[117,136]
other guidelines also support the use of  xxxg100xxx  antagonists to slow the progression of diabetic
renal disease.[96-98,137]
the idnt[78] and irma 2[77] trials showed that
irbesartan protected renal function in hypertensive
patients with type 2 diabetes at the early and later
stages of diabetic nephropathy (section 5).[77,78] in
the irma 2 trial,[77] the number of patients progressing to overt nephropathy was significantly lower with irbesartan 300mg once daily than placebo.
similarly, in the idnt, irbesartan provided significantly greater renoprotection in patients at a later

croom et al.

stage of nephropathy than the calcium channel antagonist amlodipine or placebo (see section 5).
data from these trials suggest that irbesartan
provides a renoprotective effect that goes beyond
that attributable solely to its bp-lowering effect.
based on mean clinic bp, the effect of irbesartan on
bp was similar to that of amlodipine in the idnt
(section 5.2).[78] in a subgroup of patients in the
irma 2 trial, irbesartan 300mg had a significantly
greater effect on urinary albumin excretion rate after
2 years than that seen with placebo, even though
reductions in ambulatory bp were similar in each
group (section 5.1). the renoprotective effect of
irbesartan 300mg once daily was sustained 1 month
after withdrawing antihypertensive medication, despite an increase in mean bp during that period, in a
substudy of the irma 2 trial.[81] additional support
for the renoprotective effect of irbesartan being at
least partly independent of its antihypertensive effect comes from a study in which irbesartan produced similar reductions in microalbuminuria in
hypertensive and normotensive patients with type 2
diabetes, but reduced bp significantly only in the
hypertensive patients (section 5.1).[79]
long-term studies directly comparing the efficacy and comparative costs of irbesartan with that of
other  xxxg100xxx  antagonists or with ace inhibitors in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes
and incipient or overt nephropathy have yet to be
conducted. pharmacoeconomic analyses based on
the idnt showed an improvement in life expectancy and cost savings for irbesartan in comparison
with amlodipine or placebo (section 5.2.1).
the complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin
system at the receptor offered by  xxxg100xxx  antagonists has been associated with some clinical advantages. ace inhibitor therapy is associated with
cough, considered to be related to its nonspecific
blockade of ace and the resultant accumulation of
bradykinin,  xxxg2240xxx  or both.[138,139] purposedesigned studies have reported a significantly (p ≤
0.01) lower incidence of cough with  xxxg100xxx 
antagonists than ace inhibitors.[140,141] irbesartan
has not specifically been studied in this manner;
however, it displayed a tolerability profile similar to
drugs 2004; 64 (9)

irbesartan in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy: a review

that of placebo in short-term trials and was associated with a low incidence of cough (5%) in longterm trials in hypertensive patients (see section 6).
although tolerability data are limited in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy,
the rate of adverse events per 1000 days of treatment
was significantly lower in irbesartan than placebo or
amlodipine recipients in the idnt.[78] moreover, in
the irma 2 trial,[77] serious adverse events occurred
in fewer irbesartan than placebo recipients (section
6.2).
agents that block the renin-angiotensin system
may cause hyperkalaemia, particularly in patients
with renal impairment.[113] however, the number of
irbesartan recipients withdrawing because of hyperkalaemia in the idnt (in which patients had proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine levels) was
low, although significantly higher than that in recipients of amlodipine or placebo (section 6.2). the
american diabetes association recommends the
monitoring of serum potassium levels for the development of hyperkalaemia if  xxxg100xxx  antagonists are used.[117]
the heart outcomes prevention evaluation
(hope) study and a substudy known as the microalbuminuria, cardiovascular and renal outcomes
(micro)-hope study,[109] showed that blockade of
the renin-angiotensin system by an ace inhibitor
provided protection against cardiovascular events in
patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria
or normalbuminuria.[109] in addition, in the
renaal study, losartan was associated with a
significantly lower rate of hospitalisation for congestive heart failure than placebo in patients with
type 2 diabetes and nephropathy (evaluated as a
secondary endpoint).[133]
although the idnt was not powered to detect
differences in cardiovascular outcome events
(which included death from cardiovascular causes,
nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure and
strokes), patients who initially received irbesartan
had a significantly lower incidence of congestive
heart failure than those who received placebo or
amlodipine (section 5.2). studies specifically designed to investigate the effect of irbesartan on

cardiovascular endpoints in patients with type 2
diabetes and microalbuminuria or nephropathy are
therefore warranted. studies investigating the effect
of irbesartan on other diabetic complications, namely, retinopathy and neuropathy would be of interest.
hypertensive patients with or without diabetes
may require several antihypertensives to achieve
recommended bp targets.[66,117]  xxxg100xxx  antagonists such as irbesartan may be particularly well
suited as part of multiple drug regimens because of
their low risk for adverse events and drug interactions. the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide produces additive effects on bp (section
4.2.2), and a fixed-dose combination product is
available.[89]
a number of studies in patients with diabetic
nephropathy have suggested that dual blockade of
the renin-angiotensin system with an  xxxg100xxx 
inhibitors and an ace inhibitor has a greater effect
on both bp and albuminuria than treatment with
either agent alone, including maximal recommended dosages of ace inhibitors.[123,142-146] data on
the renoprotective effect of the combination of
irbesartan and ace inhibitors are currently only
available for hypertensive patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy. two small (n = 21–24),
randomised, double-blind studies[143,144] found that
the addition of irbesartan 300mg once daily to ace
inhibitors, including enalapril at the maximal recommended dosage,[144] induced additional reductions in albuminuria and bp.
lastly, irbesartan is also being evaluated for its
effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
outcomes in two large, multinational trials.[147,148]
one is in patients with heart failure with preserved
systolic function (i preserve);[148] the other is an
assessment of clopidogrel and aspirin in patients
with atrial fibrillation that includes a factorial evaluation of the effects of irbesartan (atrial fibrillation
clopidogrel trials with irbesartan for prevention of
vascular events [active]).[147]
in conclusion, irbesartan is a well-tolerated and
effective antihypertensive agent. it also slows the
progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients
with type 2 diabetes at both the early and later stages

of diabetic nephropathy. thus, irbesartan is a valuable agent in the management of patients with these
indications.
