abstract

the effects of a newly synthesized pyridazinone derivative, nz-107, 4-bromo-
5-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxybenzylamino)-3(2h)-pyridazinone, and two well-known.
antiasthmatic drugs,  xxxd157xxx  (orally active  xxxd1763xxx -like
drug) and  xxxd1763xxx  (dscg) on antigen-, histamine- and leu-
kotriene c, (ltc,)-induced constriction of isolated human tracheal muscle,
and histamine release from human lung tissues and leukocytes were investi-
gated in vitro. in some experiments, salbutamol was used as a reference drug.
nz-107 inhibited antigen-, histamine- and ltc,-induced contraction of tra-
cheal muscle.  xxxd157xxx  and dscg did not affect the contractile response of
tracheal muscle caused by each stimulant. salbutamol inhibited antigen-in-
duced contraction of tracheal muscle. nz-107,  xxxd157xxx , dscg and salbuta-
mol clearly inhibited the antigen-induced release of histamine and ltc, from
human lung tissue. the antigen-induced histamine release from atopic human
leukocytes was inhibited by nz-107 and  xxxd157xxx , but not by dscg. pre-
treatment with  xxxg1177xxx  did not alter antigen-induced contraction of tracheal mus-
cle and histamine release from lung tissue, but antigen- or calcium ionophore
a 23187-induced histamine release from leukocytes was clearly enhanced. am-
lexanox inhibited the  xxxg1177xxx -induced enhancement of histamine release from
leukocytes in the case of both stimuli, but nz-107 and dscg had no effect.
these data suggest that nz-107 has potent anti-allergic actions based on the
inhibition of antigen-induced contraction of human tracheal muscle and
mediator release from human lung tissue and leukocytes.

introduction

4-bromo-5-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxybenzylamino)-3(2h)-

pyridazinone (nz-107) is a newly synthesized substance
which shows an inhibitory effect on bronchoconstriction
caused by several different stimuli in guinea pigs [1-4]. in
vivo experiments, nz-107 inhibited the antigen-induced
slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (srs-a)-, leuko-
triene d, (ltd,)-, u46619- and paf-induced broncho-
constriction in guinea pigs. in addition, nz-107 inhibited
the contraction of guinea pig tracheal muscle caused by
antigen and ltd, in vitro. besides the inhibition of bron-
choconstriction, nz-107 was efficacious in inhibiting ex-
perimental asthma and allergic reactions induced in ex-
perimental animals [5]. these results indicate that nz-107
has an antiasthmatic activity in experimental animals and
may therefore be useful in treating human bronchial
asthma. the present study was thus undertaken to investi-
gate the effects of nz-107 on antigen-, histamine- and
ltc,-induced contractions in isolated human bronchial
muscle and the effects of nz-107 on antigen-induced his-
tamine release from human lung fragments and leuko-
cytes. its effects were studied in comparison with those of
 xxxd157xxx , which has been reported to be an oraly active
antiasthmatic drug due to the mast cell-stabilizing activity
[6-10], and  xxxd1763xxx  (dscg). in some ex-
periments, salbutamol was used as a reference drug.

materials and methods

materials

histamine and carbachol (nacalai tesque, kyoto, japan) dextran
t-500 (pharmacia, uppsala, sweden), human recombinant  xxxg1177xxx 
(cosmobio, tokyo, japan) and calcium ionophore a 23187 (sigma,
st. louis, mo., usa) were purchased. nz-107 (nissan chemical, fu-
nabashi and zeria pharmaceutical, saitama, japan),  xxxd157xxx 
(takeda, osaka, japan), dscg (fujisawa, osaka, japan) and salbu-
tamol (fujikawa, tokyo, japan) were donated by each company.

each agent was dissolved in saline or methanol. when the agent
dissolved in methanol was applied to tissues or cells, the concentra-
tions of methanol was under 0.02%. in order to anticipate the efficacy
of drugs in clinical application, we tested the effect of drugs in g/ml
concentrations. human atopic serum obtained from allergic subjects
(rast score of more than 3) was provided by sagamihara national
hospital. mite antigen was prepared using a method described previ-
ously [11]. in brief, mass-cultured dermatophagoides farinae were
killed and dried. the d. farinae were defatted with ether and ex-
tracted with 0.01 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.7). after centrifugation at
150 g for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed using a visking tube
36/32 against distilled water at 4 °c for 48 h. the resulting non-dialyz-
able fraction was lyophilized and used as mite antigen, yielding a
preparation with 36.3% protein content.

‘the buffers used in the experiment of antigen-induced histamine
release from human leukocytes were as follows:  xxxd3449xxx , tris-hci
buffer containing 31 mm tris and 119 mm nacl and adjusted to a ph
of 7.4 using 0.1 n hci; tris-a buffer,  xxxd3449xxx  containing 0.03% hu-
man  xxxg124xxx  ( xxxd1866xxx , stockholm, sweden), and tris-
acm buffer, tris-a buffer containing 2 mm  xxxg2125xxx , 2h,o and 1 mm
mgcl, 6h,0.

experiment on bronchial preparation

the bronchial preparation was prepared as follows. samples of
human trachea with no descernible pathological lesion were obtained
by surgical resection from 15 patients (43-74 years old; 11 males and 4
females) with suspected lung cancer. nine of them were cigarette
smokers. no patient had bronchial asthma, bronchial carcinoma and
severe bronchitis. the bronchus was trimmed of excess tissue and cut
vertically along the cartilage tissue area. each open bronchus was
then cut horizontally into strips. the strips were washed with ty-
rode’s solution and suspended in 4-times-diluted human atopic se-
rum (5 ml/g tissue) at 37°c for 30 min and then at 4°c for 15 h for
passive sensitization. the passively sensitized strip was placed in an
organ bath containing tyrode’s solution. with an initial resting ten-
sion of 0.5 g, isotonic changes in the preparation were recorded
(mec, me-4013, world medical). nz-107,  xxxd157xxx  and dscg
were each incubated with bronchial strip for 10 min before the addi-
tion of antigen. when the effect of  xxxg1177xxx  was examined,  xxxg1177xxx  at a dose
of 2.5 x 10° g/ml was added 20 min before the antigen. the addition
of antigen at a concentration of 5 x 10~ g/ml induced a contraction
which was recorded for 15 min. the contractile responses were ex-
pressed as a percentage of the initial contraction induced by 107 g/ml
carbachol. cumulative concentration-contraction curves for hista-
mine or ltd, were generated for each tracheal chain by successively
increasing the bath concentration of histamine or ltc, in accord-
ance with the method of van rossum [12]. each successive concentra-
tion increase was made after the plateau of the contraction due to
preceding histamine or ltc, administration was reached. the con-
tractile responses were expressed as percentages of the maximum
control histamine or ltc, contraction.

histamine and ltc, release from human lung fragments

the normal portion of isolated human lung tissue obtained from
patients with suspected lung cancer was cut into small pieces using
scissors which suspended in tyrode’s solution. the fragments were
washed with tyrode’s solution 3 times and suspended in 4-times-di-
luted human atopic serum (5 ml/g tissue) at 37°c for 30 min and then
at 4°c for 15 h for passive sensitization. the sensitized lung frag-
ments (200 mg) suspended in 1.8 ml of tyrode’s solution were in-
cubated at 37°c for 5 min before the addition of drugs. the drug so-
lution, at a volume of 0.1 ml, was added to the reaction mixture and in-
cubated at 37°c for 10 min. then, 0.1 ml of mite antigen at a final
concentration of 5x10 g/ml was added to the suspension of lung
fragments at 37°c for ih, the supernatant was obtained by filtring
the suspension through a nylon mesh and centrifuging it at 250g for
10 min at 4°c. the concentration of histamine in the supernatant was
determined by a fluorescence method using the hplc system (toso,
tokyo, shimazu, kyoto, and system instruments, tokyo, japan).
modified as described by yamatodani et al. [13]. to study the eff
of  xxxg1177xxx  on antigen-induced histamine release from passively sensi-
tized lung tissues,  xxxg1177xxx  was incubated with lung tissue at 37°c for 20
min before the addition of antigen. other experimental procedures
were carried out as described above.

anti-allergic action of nz-107 in vitro
in order to measure the amount of ltc,, | ml of supernatant was
mixed with 4 ml of ethanol. this sample solution was centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°c. the supernatant was evaporated under
40°c. samples were then applied to a c-18 column after adjusting the
ph to 5.1 with 1 n hcl and being washed with distilled water (20 ml).
following this procedure, ltc, was eluted with ethanol at a volume
of 20 ml. the effluent was then evaporated, and the amount of ltc,
in the residual solution measured by radioimmunoassay (amersham
kit).

histamine release from human leukocytes

human leukocytes were prepared by the method of urisu et al.
[14]. venous blood was obtained from allergic subjects using a sterile
syringe containing heparin (10 u/ml). blood samples were mixed with
3% dextran t-500 saline solution containing 3% glucose and kept at
room temperature for 30 min in order to separate the erythrocytes
and platelets from the leukocyte-rich fraction. the supernatant was
collected in a polystyrene tube and centrifuged at 150g for 10 min at
4°c. the sedimented cells were gently washed twice with tris-a (ph
7.3) buffer containing 1 mm edta and resuspended at 1 x 10” cells/ml
in tris-acm buffer.

the leukocytes suspended in tris-acm buffer at a volume of 0.8
ml were preincubated at 37°c for 5 min. the drug solution at a vol-
ume of 0.1 ml was added and incubated at 37°c for 10 min. thereaf-
ter, mite antigen solution (0.2 ml) at a concentration of 5x 10° g/ml
was added to the leukocyte solution and incubated at 37°c for 30
min. the reaction mixture was centrifugated at 150 g at 4°c for 10
min. the amount of histamine in the supernatant was measured as
described above. in order to examine a 23187-induced histamine re-
lease, a 23187 at a dose of 2x10” g/ml was added to the leukocyte
suspension obtained from normal volunteers and incubated at 37°c
for 20 min. the amount of histamine was measured as described
above. when the effect of drugs on  xxxg1177xxx  augmented histamine release
from human leukocytes,  xxxg1177xxx  at a concentration of 2.5 ng/ml was add-
ed to the leukocyte suspension and incubated at 37°c for 20 min. the
leukocytes were, then, washed twice with tris-a buffer and resus-
pended in tris-acm buffer. histamine release was then evoked by

antigen-, histamine- and ltc,-induced contraction of

tracheal muscle

the effects of test agents on antigen-induced contrac-
tion of sensitized human tracheal muscle are indicated in
figure 1. pretreatment of tracheal muscle with nz-107
(5x10 and 10° g/ml) significantly inhibited the ampli-
tude of the contraction caused by antigen. dscg and am-
lexanox (10° g/ml) did not affect the antigen-induced con-
traction. salbutamol (2 x 10° g/ml) clearly inhibited the
antigen-induced contraction. nz-107 at a dose of 10 g/ml
inhibited the contractions caused by histamine and ltc.
 xxxd157xxx  and dscg at a dose of 10> g/ml had no effect
on the histamine- or ltc,-induced contraction (fig. 2).

salbutamol showed the most potent inhibition. in leuko-
cyte experiments, nz-107 and  xxxd157xxx  but not dscg

from lung tissue and leukocytes, and a 23187-induced hi:
tamine release from leukocytes were investigated. as
shown in figure 5, antigen-induced bronchoconstriction
and histamine release from lung tissue were not affected
by pretreatment with  xxxg1177xxx . in contrast, antigen- or a
23187-induced histamine release from leukocytes was
clearly enhanced by the addition of  xxxg1177xxx . as indicated in
figure 6,  xxxd157xxx  inhibited the increased histamine re-
lease caused by both antigen and a 23187, but nz-107 and
dscg did not affect the enhancement by antigen or a
23187.

discussion

antigen-induced contractions of airway tissue from ex-
perimental animals and humans have been used as a
model for evaluating antiasthmatic drugs and investigat-
ing their mode of action. such constrictions are caused by
many bronchoactive substances released from mast cells
[15-17]. in the present study, we reported the effects of
nz-107,  xxxd157xxx , dscg and salbutamol on the anti-
gen-induced contraction of isolated human tracheal mus-
cle passively sensitized with atopic serum. contraction was

found to be inhibited by nz-107 and salbutamol, but not
by  xxxd157xxx  or dscg. the modulation of antigen-in-
duced contraction of isolated tracheal muscle by drugs has
been investigated mainly in guinea pigs and humans. in
human tracheal preparations, some drugs — including di-
phenhydramine, fpl-55712, indomethacin and nedocro-
mil sodium — inhibited the magnitude of contraction in-
duced by antigen [18-20]. the effects of  xxxd157xxx  and
dscg on antigen-induced contraction have not been re-
ported, whereas  xxxd157xxx  and dscg clearly inhibited
the release of histamine and ltc, from sensitized lung tis-

61
sues, they did not affect the contractile response of tra-
chea! muscle. napier et al. [20] reported that nedocromil
sodium also inhibited the release of histamine and ltc,
from human lung tissues without any direct relationship in
inhibiting antigen-induced constriction of isolated tra-
cheal muscle. similar results were reported by chand et al.
[6] by studying the effect of dscg and ketotifen on anti-
gen-induced contraction in isolated guinea pig tracheal
muscle. these results suggested that no direct relationship
existed between the inhibitions of antigen-induced media-
tor release from lung tissues and the antigen-induced con-
tractile responses of tracheal muscle. another uncertain
mechanism may be involved in antigen-induced contrac-
tion of isolated tracheal muscle.

since some investigators have reported that an leuko-
triene receptor antagonist (fpl-55712) and a lipoxygenase
inhibitor ( xxxd2748xxx ) inhibited the antigen-induced contrac-
tion of isolated guinea pig tracheal muscle [16, 21, 22],
lipoxygenase products, especially leukotrienes, are con-
sidered to play an important role in the antigen-induced
contraction of tracheal muscle. regarding the effects of
nz-107, yamamoto et al. [2] reported that nz-107 inhib-
ited the antigen-induced contraction of isolated guinea
pig tracheal muscle by inhibiting srs-a release and its re-
sponses. our present results using human tissues con-
firmed their data obtained from guinea pigs. the inhibi-
tion of antigen-induced in vitro bronchoconstriction by
nz-107 is due to the inhibition of the anaphylactic media-
tor release and their responses.

 

regarding  xxxg1177xxx -induced enhancement of histamine re-
lease, there are some reports to show an enhancement in
the release of histamine and ltc, caused by anti-ige anti-
body or anaphylatoxin c5a from human basophils [23-26].
in the present study,  xxxg1177xxx  enhanced the release of hista-
mine caused by antigen and calcium ionophore a 23187
from peripheral leukocytes, but did not affect antigen-in-
duced in vitro bronchoconstriction and histamine release
from lung tissues.  xxxd157xxx  clearly inhibited the  xxxg1177xxx -
induced increase in histamine release from leukocytes.
many investigators reported that the antiasthmatic action
of  xxxd157xxx  seems to be related to the inhibition of anti-
gen-induced mediator release [6-10]. our present results
suggest that another antiallergic mechanism, an anti- xxxg1177xxx 
effect, may contribute to the antiasthmatic action of am-
lexanox. nz-107 and dscg did not affect the reaction.
the meaning of  xxxg1177xxx -induced enhancement in histamine
release is still obscure. whereas de weck et al. [25] sug-
gested the role of  xxxg1177xxx  in late asthmatic response, there is
no direct evidence to indicate the participation of  xxxg1177xxx  in
the onset of late asthmatic responses. further experiments
will be necessary to clarify the role of  xxxg1177xxx  in asthma.

the present results suggest that the useful therapeutic
effects of nz-107 in the treatment of allergic asthma de-
pend in part on its ability to inhibit the antigen-induced re-
lease of histamine and leukotrienes and consequently on
antigen-induced contraction of tracheal muscle.
