abstract
one challenging aspect in the clinical development of
molecularly targeted therapies, which represent a new and
promising approach to treating cancers, has been the identification of a biologically active dose rather than a maximum
tolerated dose. the goal of the present study was to identify a
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in preclinical
models that could be used to help guide selection of a clinical
dose.  xxxd3264xxx , a novel small molecule receptor  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor with direct antitumor as well as antiangiogenic activity via targeting the  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf), platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf), kit, and
 xxxg801xxx  receptor tyrosine kinases, was used as the pharmacological agent in these studies. in mouse xenograft models,  xxxd3264xxx 
exhibited broad and potent antitumor activity causing regression, growth arrest, or substantially reduced growth of various
established xenografts derived from human or rat tumor cell
lines. to predict the target  xxxd3264xxx  exposure required to
achieve antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models, we directly measured target phosphorylation in tumor xenografts
before and after  xxxd3264xxx  treatment and correlated this with

plasma inhibitor levels. in target modulation studies in vivo,
 xxxd3264xxx  selectively inhibited  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  (vegf receptor 2)
and pdgf receptor ␤ phosphorylation (in a time- and dosedependent manner) when plasma concentrations of inhibitor
reached or exceeded 50 –100 ng/ml. similar results were obtained in a functional assay of vegf-induced vascular permeability in vivo. constant inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  and pdgf
receptor ␤ phosphorylation was not required for efficacy; at
highly efficacious doses, inhibition was sustained for 12 h of a
24-h dosing interval. the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
relationship established for  xxxd3264xxx  in these preclinical studies
has aided in the design, selection, and evaluation of dosing
regimens being tested in human trials.

introduction
the receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks)2 are transmembrane
proteins containing extracellular ligand-binding domains and
intracellular catalytic domains, and are activated following binding of their cognate ligands. much of the specificity in signal
transduction stems from the specific interaction of rtks with
their ligands, with both receptors and ligands having defined
patterns of expression (1). many of the processes involved in
tumor growth, progression and metastasis are mediated by signaling molecules acting downstream of activated rtks (2).
in particular, several members of the split kinase domain
superfamily of rtks are expressed on solid tumor cells and participate in autocrine loops implicated in cancer growth and survival
[e.g. vegf receptors in melanoma, pdgf receptors in gliomas,
kit in small cell lung cancer and  xxxg801xxx  in acute myelogenous
leukemia] (3– 6). some rare solid tumors are driven by constitutively activated versions of these targets or their ligands (e.g. kit
juxtamembrane mutation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and
collagen ia1/pdgf-b fusions in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans) (4, 5). mutations of these split kinase domain rtks have been
particularly evident in hematopoietic malignancies, such as activating mutations of  xxxg801xxx  in acute myelogenous leukemia (6) and
activating translocations of  xxxg1710xxx ␤ in chronic myelogenous
monocytic leukemia patients (7). even where mutations have not
been detected, inhibition of these split kinase domain rtk targets

would be anticipated to result in direct effects against cancer cells
dependent upon them for growth and survival.
in addition to their direct role in tumor cell growth and
survival, several split kinase domain rtks, namely the vegf
receptors and  xxxg1710xxx ␤, play prominent roles in tumor neoangiogenesis (3). vegf produced by the tumor cells and associated
stromal cells acts on endothelial cells, directly promoting their
proliferation, migration, invasion and survival, all critical facets of
angiogenesis (8).  xxxg1710xxx ␤ is expressed on pericytes, smooth muscle cells which provide mechanical support to vasculature and is
also expressed on tumor neovasculature (9, 10). in addition,
 xxxg1710xxx ␤ is also expressed on fibroblasts in the tumor stromal
compartment, which are an important source of vegf and other
growth factors (11). recent data suggest that combined pharmacological disruption of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤ signaling results in
profound anti-angiogenic effects (12).
thus, the signaling cascades generated by the split kinase
domain rtks described above (the vegf receptors,  xxxg1274xxx /
 xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg800xxx ; the pdgf receptors,  xxxg1710xxx ␣ and  xxxg1710xxx ␤;
kit and  xxxg801xxx ) directly and indirectly regulate tumor growth,
survival and angiogenesis. inhibiting these targets in concert
might be expected to result in broad antitumor efficacy.
to date, signaling inhibitors have generally proven to be
relatively well tolerated at efficacious doses in preclinical studies (17). hence, the emergence of such targeted inhibitors poses
a challenge to the traditional cytotoxic paradigm of cancer
therapy, whereby agents are administered to the mtd (17).
moreover, rapid tumor debulking in patients (such as that often
seen with cytotoxic drugs) may not necessarily be anticipated or
observed with this class of agents, making their biological
activity in patients more difficult to monitor than for traditional
therapies.
the challenge of identifying biologically active doses for
molecularly targeted anticancer agents has enhanced the effort
to identify biomarkers that can be used to monitor target inhibition or evidence of a surrogate biological effect to guide dose
selection. however, until such biomarkers can be identified and
validated, an alternative approach to guide clinical development
of targeted inhibitors would be to select doses based on a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic parameters driving
suppression of target activity and consequent tumor responses,
initially in preclinical species and, ultimately, in patients.
on the basis of the fact that pharmacokinetic properties
such as drug clearance and metabolism often vary substantially
between rodents and humans, it is necessary to determine in
preclinical efficacy models the plasma levels necessary to inhibit a given target and the duration of inhibition necessary to
achieve a biological effect to anticipate exposures necessary to
achieve effects in patients. it is anticipated that the information
developed from preclinical models will provide guidance in the
clinical setting even if there are substantial differences in the
shapes of the plasma inhibitor concentration versus time profiles
in preclinical species and humans.
we report here the results of such preclinical studies for
 xxxd3264xxx  (fig. 1), a novel, selective multitargeted rtk inhibitor that exhibits direct antitumor activity against tumor cells
dependent on signaling through  xxxg1710xxx , kit,  xxxg801xxx , or  xxxg1274xxx 
for proliferation/survival in addition to antiangiogenic activity
through its potent inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  signaling.

fig. 1 chemical structure of  xxxd3264xxx .

using biochemical and biological readouts, we evaluated the
pk/pd relationship for  xxxd3264xxx -induced inhibition of its target
rtks in rodent xenograft models. these data were subsequently
integrated with tumor efficacy data to elucidate the relationship
between plasma inhibitor concentration necessary to effect target modulation and duration of target inhibition necessary to
effect a tumor response to  xxxd3264xxx  treatment. the conclusions
from these studies are currently being used to help guide early
clinical evaluation of this compound.

mouse xenograft models. unless otherwise indicated,
female nu/nu mice (8 –12 weeks old, 25 grams), obtained from
charles river (wilmington, ma), were used for these studies.
animals were maintained under clean-room conditions in sterile
filter-top cages with aspen chip bedding housed on hepa-filtered
ventilated racks. animals received sterile rodent chow and water ad
libitum. animal experiments were conducted as described previously (10, 12) in accordance with institutional animal care and
use committee guidelines in the sugen animal facility, which
has been accredited by association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international.
briefly, 3–5 ⫻ 106 tumor cells were implanted s.c. into the
hind flank region of mice on day 0 as described previously (12).
daily treatment of tumor-bearing mice with oral administration of
 xxxd3264xxx  as a carboxymethyl cellulose suspension or as a citrate
buffered (ph 3.5) solution was initiated once the tumors reached
the indicated average size. tumor growth was evaluated based on
twice-weekly measurement of tumor volume as described previously (10, 12). typically, studies were terminated when tumors in
vehicle-treated animals reached an average size of 1000 mm3 or
when the tumors were judged to adversely effect the well being of
the animals. because tumors were established and often large at the
time treatment was initiated, percentage of inhibition of tumor
growth after initiation of treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  was calculated as
100 ⫻ {1 ⫺ [(tumor volumefinal ⫺ tumor volumeinitial for the
 xxxd3264xxx -treated group)/(tumor volumefinal ⫺ tumor volumeinitial
for the vehicle-treated group)]}.
mvd. tumor specimens to be evaluated for mvd were
harvested and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h before
being transferred to 70% ethanol. the specimens were subsequently paraffin-embedded and sectioned. general tissue morphology and mitotic figures were visualized by h&e staining.
tumor microvessels were visualized using immunohistochemical detection of  xxxg1724xxx  using a 1:100 dilution of the rat antimouse monoclonal antibody mec 13.3 (bd pharmingen, san
diego, ca) and visualized using the labeled streptavidin biotin
plus kit (dako, carpinteria, ca). all of the immunostained
sections were counterstained using hematoxylin. three or four
fields per tumor were scored (in blinded fashion) for tumor
microvessel elements at ⫻400 magnification by two blinded
observers, and tumor microvessel densities (i.e., number of
microvessel elements/field) were calculated.
xenogen ivis imaging system. pc-3m cells expressing
luciferase were resuspended in pbs (5 ⫻ 106 cells/100 ␮l), combined with an equal volume of basement matrigel matrix (becton
dickinson, bedford, ma), and injected s.c. into the hind flank
region of male nu/nu mice. tumors were allowed to grow untreated
until they reached 200 –300 mm3, at which point the mice underwent initial imaging. before imaging, mice were given a 150 mg/kg
dose of d-luciferin (xenogen) by i.p. injection immediately before
being anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg). mice were imaged 15 min after luciferin
administration using the ivis system to determine total flux (photons/sec) of emitted light as a measure of the relative number of
viable tumor cells in the tumor. data were analyzed using xenogen
livingimager software.

in vivo target modulation studies. in vivo target modulation studies to determine the effect of inhibitor treatment on
the phosphorylation of target rtks expressed on tumor cells
were performed as described previously (13, 22). briefly, implanted tumor cells expressing the desired target (a375 melanoma cells for  xxxg1274xxx , sf767t glioma cells for  xxxg1710xxx , and
a431 epidermoid cells for egfr) were allowed to grow untreated to a size of 300 –500 mm3. mice were then administered
a single oral dose of  xxxd3264xxx  at the indicated concentration. at
the indicated times after dosing, individual mice were sacrificed,
their tumors resected, and a blood sample taken by cardiac
puncture using a syringe primed with heparin sulfate.
resected tumors were snap frozen on dry ice, pulverized
using a liquid nitrogen-cooled cryomortar and pestle, and lysed in
cold htng buffer [50 mm hepes (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl, 1.5 mm
mgcl2, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% triton x-100, 1% sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm naf, 2 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 2 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and
2 ␮g/ml pepstatin a]. total  xxxg1710xxx , egfr, fgfr, or  xxxd1075xxx -containing protein (for  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx ) was immunoprecipitated from individual powdered tumors, and the amount of phosphorylated and total rtk in each sample determined by western
blot analysis. the extent of phosphorylation in tumors resected
from  xxxd3264xxx -treated animals was typically compared with that in
tumors resected from untreated or vehicle-treated animals, either
predose or at the same time point, based on visual inspection of
films after western blot analysis. in this evaluation, compound was
judged to have had a weak (⬍25% inhibition), moderate (25–75%
inhibition), or strong (⬎75% inhibition) effect on receptor phosphorylation based on comparison of the estimated ratio of phosphorylated to total receptor in mice receiving different treatments.
in experiments to evaluate egfr phosphorylation, epidermal
growth factor (50 ␮g) was injected into the tail vein of each mouse
30 min before sacrifice.
plasma samples, obtained by centrifuging individual blood
samples at 3000 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°c in an eppendorf 5417r
refrigerated centrifuge, were stored at ⫺80°c until they could be
analyzed for drug concentration using liquid chromatography
with tandem mass spectrometric detection. briefly, plasma samples (100 ␮l) or  xxxd3264xxx  standards in mouse plasma were
mixed with acetonitrile (400 ␮l), the mixture filtered using a 3m
empore 96-well ppt filter plate (3m, minneapolis, mn), and
each filtrate sample was injected onto a lc/ms/ms system
where separation occurred on a bds  xxxd3100xxx  c-18 (5 ␮m, 50 ⫻
4.6 mm) reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (keystone scientific, foster city, ca). the amount
of inhibitor and the internal standard ( xxxd3033xxx  hydrochloride) in each mouse plasma sample was quantified based on
standard curves generated using known amounts of compound.
in these studies, plasma inhibitor concentration is calculated as
the combined concentration of  xxxd3264xxx  and its primary metabolite, which has biological activity comparable with  xxxd3264xxx

alone. seven, 11, 15, or 23 h later, 100 ␮l of a 2.2% (w/v) solution
of fitc-dextran (150 kda; sigma) was administered i.v. via the
tail vein. one h later, mice were injected intradermally with 400 ng
of vegf (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) dissolved in 20 ␮l of
pbs or pbs alone (duplicate points for a total of four injection sites
per mouse). thirty min later, vegf-dependent dye leakage from
the vasculature into skin was imaged using a fluorescent stereomicroscope (leica mz7.5; leica microsystems inc., bannockburn,
il) and quantitatively scored using a photoshop plug-in (image
processing tool kit 4.0; reindeer games inc., raleigh, nc). for
each animal a vascular permeability score was calculated [vegfdependent fluorescence divided by control (pbs) fluorescence].
scores for individual animals in a treatment group were
averaged to derive a group vascular permeability score. percentage of inhibition relative to vehicle-treated groups was
then calculated.

results
in vitro studies
the in vitro activity of  xxxd3264xxx  was evaluated using
biochemical assays, and ligand-dependent cell kinase and cell
proliferation assays (table 1). in biochemical assays,  xxxd3264xxx 
exhibited competitive inhibition (with regard to atp) against
 xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤ with ki values of 0.009 ␮m and 0.008 ␮m,
respectively.  xxxd3264xxx  was also a competitive, albeit less potent,
inhibitor of  xxxg791xxx   xxxg2198xxx  activity, with a ki value of
0.83 ␮m. in addition to these three structurally related split
kinase domain rtks, the activity of  xxxd3264xxx  has also been
evaluated against a broad panel of additional tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. in these biochemical assays, the ic50
values for  xxxd3264xxx  were generally at least 10-fold higher than
those for  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  (e.g., ic50 values of: ⬎10 ␮m for
egfr and  xxxg410xxx ; 4 ␮m for met; 2.4 ␮m for  xxxg1145xxx -1; 0.8 ␮m for
abl; and 0.6 ␮m for src). however, it should be noted that
whereas  xxxd3264xxx  does not inhibit rtks outside the split kinase
domain rtk subfamily, it is a potent inhibitor of kit4 and
 xxxg801xxx  (22), two other split kinase domain rtks.

the ability of  xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit ligand-dependent rtk
phosphorylation in cells was evaluated using cell lines that
normally express or were engineered to express high levels of
the rtk of interest. as shown in table 1,  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited
vegf-dependent  xxxg1274xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation and pdgfdependent  xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation with ic50 values of ⬃0.01
␮m for both rtks. these values are similar to the ki values
determined for the two rtks in the biochemical assays and
confirm that  xxxd3264xxx  has equal activity against the two targets.
in addition to evaluating the ability of  xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit
ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation in cells, the effect of
 xxxd3264xxx  on ligand-dependent proliferation of cells was examined.
as shown in table 1,  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited vegf- and fgf-induced
proliferation of huvecs with ic50 values of 0.04 and 0.7 ␮m,
respectively.  xxxd3264xxx  also inhibited pdgf-induced proliferation
of nih-3t3 cells overexpressing  xxxg1710xxx ␤ or  xxxg1710xxx ␣ with ic50
values of 0.03 and 0.07 ␮m, respectively. thus, the ability of
 xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit cell mitogenic and proliferative responses to
ligand stimulation was consistent with its relative activity against
the specific rtk, indicating that the cellular activity of  xxxd3264xxx 
mirrors its biochemical activity.
in vivo studies
efficacy studies in mouse xenograft models. the in
vivo efficacy of  xxxd3264xxx  was studied in s.c. xenograft models
using human (ht-29, a431, colo205, h-460, sf763t, a375, and
mda-mb-435) and rat (c6) tumor cells derived from various
different tumor types. after implantation into the hind flank region
of athymic mice, tumors were allowed to grow to a size of 100 –550
mm3 before starting daily oral treatment with  xxxd3264xxx .
the results of representative studies with once daily oral
dosing for each of the tumor models tested are summarized in
table 2, and examples are shown in fig. 2. these data indicate that
 xxxd3264xxx  was efficacious against all of the tumor types tested, even
when treatment was not initiated until the tumors were quite large.
in three of the models (a431, colo205, and c6), the dose response
for  xxxd3264xxx  was also evaluated. in each of these tumor models
 xxxd3264xxx  had a dose-dependent effect, with the 80 mg/kg/day dose
providing little, if any, additional benefit compared with 40 mg/
kg/day, but the 40 mg/kg/day dose being more effective than 20
mg/kg/day. thus, for all of the models tested, 40 mg/kg/day was
considered to be a very efficacious dose.
to determine whether  xxxd3264xxx  treatment could eradicate
tumors, mice bearing established a431 tumors (100 mm3) were
dosed with  xxxd3264xxx  at 80 mg/kg/day for 21 days. on the basis
of caliper measurements, complete tumor regression occurred in
six of the eight mice, and the tumors did not regrow during a
110-day observation period after the end of treatment. in the two
animals in which the tumors did not fully regress, the tumors
were allowed to regrow to a large size (2000 –3000 mm3) before
reinitiating treatment with  xxxd3264xxx . both tumors regressed in
response to this second round of treatment (data not shown),
indicating that  xxxd3264xxx  remained efficacious against tumors
that were not fully regressed during the first round of treatment.
in addition to measuring changes in tumor volume, the
effect of  xxxd3264xxx  treatment in representative experiments was
evaluated based on histological and immunohistochemical analysis of tumors resected from treated and untreated animals. one
observation from these studies was that  xxxd3264xxx  treatment

resulted in a decrease in tumor mvd, which is taken to be an
indication of antiangiogenic activity consistent with the demonstration that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits vegf-dependent mitogenic response of huvecs in vitro (table 1). as an example,  xxxd3264xxx 
treatment resulted in a ⬃40% reduction in mvd (24.2 ⫾ 4.1
versus 39.3 ⫾ 5.7; p ⬍ 0.05) in sf763t glioma tumors (fig. 3),
which, like c6 tumors, exhibited a greatly slowed growth rate
but did not undergo regression or stasis after treatment with
 xxxd3264xxx . thus, these data provide direct evidence of the antiangiogenic activity of  xxxd3264xxx , even in a tumor model that
does not regress in response to  xxxd3264xxx  treatment.
another observation from the histological studies was that
in tumors derived from some cell lines (e.g., h-460 lung carcinoma cells)  xxxd3264xxx  treatment resulted in extensive histological destruction of the tumor mass (data not shown) although
there was no apparent reduction in tumor size (table 2; 84%
growth inhibition but no evidence of regression). thus, it was
possible to have extensive antitumor activity although there was
little or no evidence of tumor regression, a phenomenon we have
noted previously with another inhibitor targeting  xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1710xxx  (13). because of the potential to underestimate the
overall effect (growth inhibition, stasis, or regression) based on
external measurements of tumor volume, we have investigated
alternative methods of evaluating antitumor activity in mouse
xenograft models. in particular, we have investigated the use of

colo205 tumor xenografts in athymic mice. sf763t human glioma (a)
or colo205 human colon (b) tumors were established in athymic mice.
daily oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  at 80 mg/kg/day was initiated
when the tumors reached an average size of 550 mm3 (sf763t) or 350
mm3 (colo205) and continued through the end of the experiment.
tumor volume was measured on the indicated days, with the mean
tumor volume indicated for groups of 8 (treated) or 16 (vehicle control)

a noninvasive imaging technology, the xenogen in vivo imaging
system (25), to monitor antitumor effects in individual mice
throughout the course of a study. this technology relies on
measurement of luminescence produced by live tumor cells
engineered to express luciferase as a way to evaluate viability of
tumor cells.
the results of a representative experiment in which the
efficacy of  xxxd3264xxx  was evaluated in male nu/nu mice bearing
luciferase-expressing pc-3m (human prostate) tumors are
shown in fig. 4. in this experiment, caliper measurements of the
tumors suggested that  xxxd3264xxx  treatment resulted in a complete
inhibition of additional tumor growth (i.e., stasis) but no reduction in tumor size (fig. 4a). in contrast, detection of photon
emissions (fig. 4, b and c) as an indicator of the relative

fig. 3  xxxd3264xxx  treatment results in inhibition of sf763t tumor mvd. mice bearing established (500 mm3) sf763t tumors were treated with
 xxxd3264xxx  at 80 mg/kg/day or with vehicle. tumors were harvested 13 days after initiation of treatment (9 days in the case of vehicle because of rapid
tumor growth). tumors were fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, immunostained for  xxxg1724xxx , and counterstained with hematoxylin. representative
⫻400 fields are shown. arrows indicate  xxxg1724xxx -positive cells (vessel elements).

number of viable tumor cells revealed that, in comparison with
when treatment was initiated (day 14), the  xxxd3264xxx -treated
mice had a reduction in viable tumor cells on day 43, the last day
of treatment. thus, the xenogen system, like histological evaluation, provided a more accurate indication of the antitumor
activity of  xxxd3264xxx  than did measurement of tumor volume. it
should be noted that in a second experiment, in which dosing
with  xxxd3264xxx  was initiated when tumors were smaller
(⬃100 mm3), reduction in both tumor volume and photon emission was observed, suggesting that the lack of apparent decrease
in tumor size in the first study could reflect an inability to
efficiently clear debris from large pc-3m tumors.
inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation
in vivo. most of the tumor cell lines used for the efficacy
studies do not express rtks targeted by  xxxd3264xxx . therefore,
although  xxxd3264xxx  can exert direct antitumor activity against
tumors expressing target rtk(s) required for tumor cell proliferation or survival, it is assumed that the antitumor activity in
these models is primarily mediated through the antiangiogenic
activity of  xxxd3264xxx . because the vegf and pdgf receptors
are critical mediators of tumor angiogenesis, and are potently
modulated by  xxxd3264xxx  in vitro, we investigated the pk/pd
relationship underlying the activity of  xxxd3264xxx  against these
targets in vivo. although the primary antiangiogenic target for
 xxxd3264xxx  in vivo will be vegf and pdgf receptors expressed
on the endothelium and/or stroma of all solid tumors, we initially investigated the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on phosphorylation of
target rtks expressed on tumor cells themselves. this was
done to ensure that enough receptor was available to evaluate its
phosphorylation status after immunoprecipitation from tumor
lysates and western blot analysis.
the ability of a single oral dose of  xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit
 xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation in vivo was evaluated
in athymic mice bearing a375 melanoma tumors, which express
 xxxg1274xxx , or sf767t tumors, which express  xxxg1710xxx ␤. as shown in

fig. 5a, oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  at 40 mg/kg caused
substantial inhibition of vegf and pdgf receptor phosphorylation when compared with the amount of receptor phosphorylation in tumors taken from untreated or vehicle-treated mice.
from the data shown in the lower panel of fig. 5a, it is also
possible to determine that inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation extends for 12 h, but not 24 h, after administration of a
40 mg/kg dose of  xxxd3264xxx . in contrast, there is a much less
dramatic and shorter lived effect after administration of a
5 mg/kg dose of  xxxd3264xxx  (fig. 5a). with this dose, inhibition
of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation is only evident 1.5 h after dosing, which corresponds to the time at which inhibitor plasma
concentration is maximal (fig. 6). on the basis of the results of
more extensive studies similar to those shown in fig. 5a, it has
been possible to demonstrate dose- and time-dependent inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation in vivo, with the
degree of inhibition and the duration of inhibition increasing
with increasing dose. in separate experiments, we were also able
to demonstrate that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited downstream signaling
events (e.g., phosphorylation of peritoneal lymphocyte ␥ and
phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase, immediate downstream indicators of  xxxg1710xxx  activation) in tumors removed from su11248treated animals (data not shown). thus, these data provided
direct evidence that oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited
target receptor phosphorylation and signaling in vivo.
as discussed above,  xxxg1710xxx ␤ is expressed on pericytes,
stromal cells, and fibroblasts that would support neoangiogenic
vessels in solid tumors. to determine whether inhibition of
 xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation could be detected in tumors that did
not express the rtk on the tumor cells, but rather only on the
host pericytes, stromal cells, and fibroblasts, the ability of
 xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit  xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation was also evaluated
in tumors derived from cells that do not express the receptor.
colo205 cells, which do not express  xxxg1710xxx ␤ based on western
blot analysis (data not shown), were used for these experiments.

fig. 4 evaluation of  xxxd3264xxx  effects on the growth of established pc-3m tumors based on physical measurement or photon emission. pc-3m tumor
cells expressing luciferase (5 ⫻ 106 cells/mouse) were implanted s.c. into the hind flank region of male athymic mice. daily oral administration of
 xxxd3264xxx  at 40 mg/kg/day was initiated when the tumors reached an average size of 300 mm3. tumor growth was subsequently monitored based on
(a) external measurement using caliper, or (b) determination of emitted bioluminescence (photons/sec) 15 min after i.p. administration of d-luciferin
(150 mg/kg). c, photon emission from individual mice was visualized before administration of the first dose of  xxxd3264xxx  or vehicle (day 14) and after
the last measurement (day 43). red color indicates more fluorescence indicative of a greater number of live tumor cells; bars, ⫾se.

as shown in fig. 5b, oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited
 xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation in colo205 tumors. thus, because
colo205 cells do not express  xxxg1710xxx ␤, these results indicate
that oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation on host cells that support developing vessels within
the tumor.
determination of an active plasma concentration of
 xxxd3264xxx . to determine the target plasma concentration for
 xxxd3264xxx , the minimum plasma concentration of  xxxd3264xxx  required to inhibit receptor phosphorylation in vivo was determined. this was done by conducting target modulation experiments similar to those shown in fig. 5a, but using different
dose levels of  xxxd3264xxx  and harvesting samples at different
times after dosing to thoroughly investigate the dose and time
dependence of the inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation in vivo. in these experiments, plasma samples were
collected at the same time tumors were harvested to correlate
plasma inhibitor concentration with inhibition of receptor phosphorylation in the harvested tumors.
the results of these studies, which are summarized in
table 3, indicate that inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤
phosphorylation in tumors was dose- and time-dependent. in our
initial, dose-range finding studies, we determined that after a
single oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  at 40 mg/kg, a dose that

was very efficacious when administered daily, substantial inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was evident as long as 12 h,
but not 24 h, after dosing (fig. 5a, bottom). it was not until
doses reached 80 mg/kg that inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was detected for the full 24 h dosing interval (fig. 5c).
because the extent of receptor phosphorylation necessary
to result in biological (antitumor) activity it is not known, the
conclusion that continuous target inhibition was not achieved at
a very efficacious dose of  xxxd3264xxx  was additionally tested
using a functional assay to directly assess inhibition of vegfinduced vascular permeability in the skin of athymic mice (13).
thus, this assay provides a functional readout for vegf receptor activity (rather than phosphorylation) in the vascular bed
(rather than tumor cells), which is the target tissue for the
antiangiogenic activity of this inhibitor. the results of these
assays confirmed that  xxxd3264xxx  did not inhibit  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx 
activity for the full 24-h dosing period at the 40 mg/kg dose.
as summarized in table 3, essentially complete inhibition of
vegf-induced vascular permeability was observed for 12 h
after a 40 mg/kg dose, with some inhibition seen 16 h and no
inhibition seen 24 h after the dose. thus, both the target modulation and vascular permeability data from mice dosed at a very
efficacious dose (40 mg/kg) indicate that constant inhibition of

colo205 cells (5 ⫻ 106 cells/mouse) were implanted s.c. into the hind
flank region of athymic mice. mice bearing established (300 –500 mm3)
tumors were treated with a single oral dose of  xxxd3264xxx  at the indicated
dose or vehicle alone. each lane represents a separate animal. a, mice
bearing sf767t tumors were sacrificed 2 h after dosing.  xxxg1710xxx ␤ was
immunoprecipitated from tumor lysates, and western blots probed for
 xxxd1075xxx  (phospho- xxxg1710xxx ␤) or total  xxxg1710xxx ␤ ( xxxg1710xxx ␤).
alternatively, mice bearing a375 tumors were sacrificed at the indicated times after treatment with  xxxd3264xxx . total phosphotyrosinecontaining proteins were immunoprecipitated from tumor lysates and
western blots probed for  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx . total  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  was determined
in a second sample of the same lysate. b,  xxxg1710xxx ␤ was immunoprecipitated from tumor lysates prepared 4 h after oral administration of an
80 mg/kg dose of  xxxd3264xxx  to mice bearing sf763t tumors, which
express  xxxg1710xxx ␤ on the tumor cells, or colo205 tumors, which do not
express  xxxg1710xxx ␤. phospho- xxxg1710xxx ␤ and total  xxxg1710xxx ␤ were detected
as described above. c, sf767t tumors were resected at the indicated
time after oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  at 80 mg/kg. in this experiment  xxxd1075xxx -containing proteins were immunoprecipitated
from tumor lysates, and western blots probed for  xxxg1710xxx ␤. each lane
represents a single animal, and the data shown are representative of at
least two experiments.

 xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤ kinase activity is not required for
 xxxd3264xxx  to have potent antitumor activity.
the minimum plasma concentration of inhibitor required to
block  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation in vivo was
determined using target modulation experiments similar to those
described above, but with low doses of  xxxd3264xxx . by doing a
series of experiments in which the dose of inhibitor was altered
and tumor and plasma samples were collected at different times
after dosing, we were able to correlate the extent of inhibition of
receptor phosphorylation and plasma concentration of inhibitor

for both  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ␤. the results of these experiments indicated that inhibition of both target receptors was
obtained at plasma inhibitor concentrations at or above 50 –
100 ng/ml (data not shown). the similarity of the sensitivity of
 xxxg1710xxx ␤ and  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  to inhibition by  xxxd3264xxx  in vivo is
consistent with the biochemical and cellular data. data from the
vegf-induced vascular permeability assays support the identification of 50 –100 ng/ml as the minimum plasma concentration
required to inhibit  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  function in vivo.
it is worth noting that based on plasma protein binding measurements for  xxxd3264xxx , the free concentration (⬃5% of total) of
inhibitor in the blood at the 50 –100 ng/ml target plasma concentration would be in the single digit nanomolar range, which is
similar to the concentration required to inhibit ligand-dependent
receptor phosphorylation and cellular activity in cell-based assays
performed under low serum conditions (table 1). thus, there is a
good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data for  xxxd3264xxx .
in addition, based on the plasma concentration versus time curves
shown in fig. 6, the plasma concentration of inhibitor stays at or
above the target plasma concentration for ⬃12 h after administration of a very efficacious dose (40 mg/kg), but only for ⬃6 h at a
less efficacious dose of 20 mg/kg, and only approaches the target
concentration at cmax values at a nonefficacious dose of 5 mg/kg.
thus, there is agreement among the time above the target plasma
concentration, the duration of inhibition of target receptor phosphorylation, and the degree of efficacy in mouse xenograft models.
whereas the above data are highly suggestive that

 xxxd3264xxx  efficacy is driven by maintaining an effective plasma
concentration for half of the daily dosing interval, it was important to address the potential therapeutic contributions of
cmax-driven antitumor effects. to specifically address this question, dose regimen experiments were carried out in mice bearing
established colo205 tumors, which regress in response to oral
administration of  xxxd3264xxx  at a daily dose of 40 mg/kg/day
(table 1). in these experiments, groups of tumor-bearing mice
were given higher doses of  xxxd3264xxx  (up to 160 mg/kg/dose), to
achieve high maximum plasma concentrations, administered
infrequently (once or twice weekly to reduce the relative time
plasma inhibitor concentrations were maintained above the 50 –
100 ng/ml target level). alternatively, mice were given lower
doses of  xxxd3264xxx  (down to 10 mg/kg/dose) administered twice
daily to maintain time above the target plasma concentration but
reduce maximum plasma levels. the results of these studies
indicate that once or twice weekly administration of even the
highest dose (160 mg/kg/dose) did not regress the tumors, and in
fact did not statistically significantly inhibit tumor growth. in
contrast, twice daily dosing of  xxxd3264xxx  at 20 mg/kg/dose (a
dose that delayed tumor growth when administered once daily)
resulted in plasma inhibitor levels at or above the target plasma
concentration for ⬃12 h (fig. 6) and induced tumor regression
comparable with that seen with doses of 40 or 80 mg/kg administered once daily. thus, the dose regimen studies support the
conclusion that maintenance of the target plasma concentration
is responsible for driving efficacy of this compound. taken
together, the target modulation and dose regimen data indicate
that an efficacious exposure would be achieved if plasma concentrations of inhibitor are maintained at or above the 100 ng/ml
level for 12 h on a daily dosing regimen.
in vivo selectivity of  xxxd3264xxx . in mice,  xxxd3264xxx 
achieves a high maximum plasma concentration after oral administration, and it is rapidly eliminated (fig. 6). consequently,

fig. 7 the selectivity of  xxxd3264xxx  is maintained in vivo. a, a431 cells
(5 ⫻ 106 cells/mouse) were implanted s.c. into the hind flank region of
athymic mice. mice bearing established (300 –500 mm3) tumors were
given a single oral dose of  xxxd3264xxx  (40 mg/kg),  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa;
50 mg/kg), or vehicle alone. mice were sacrificed at the indicated time
after dosing, and each mouse received an i.v. dose of egf (50 ␮g)
30 min before sacrifice. egfr was immunoprecipitated from tumor
lysates and western blots probed for  xxxd1075xxx  (phospho-egfr)
or total egfr (egfr). b, colo205 cells (5 ⫻ 106 cells/mouse) were
implanted s.c. into the hind flank region of athymic mice. mice bearing
established (300 –500 mm3) tumors were given a single oral dose of
 xxxd3264xxx  (80 mg/kg) or vehicle alone.  xxxg791xxx  was immunoprecipitated
from tumors resected 4 h after dosing and western blot probed for
 xxxd1075xxx  to detect phospho- xxxg791xxx . each lane represents a
single animal, and the data shown are representative of two experiments.

high plasma inhibitor levels are achieved for relatively short
periods of time at doses necessary to maintain target plasma
concentrations (50 –100 ng/ml) for 12 h. to demonstrate that
 xxxd3264xxx  maintains its in vitro selectivity in vivo, target modulation studies similar to those described above were conducted
to evaluate its activity against egfr and  xxxg791xxx  in tumors.
these targets were selected because they represent different
levels of sensitivity to the compound with  xxxd3264xxx  inhibiting
egfr with an ic50 ⬎ 10 ␮m and  xxxg791xxx  with an ic50 ⫽
0.8 ␮m in biochemical assays (table 1).
as shown in fig. 7a, an efficacious dose of  xxxd3264xxx 
(40 mg/kg) had no effect on egfr phosphorylation in vivo
although tumors were resected 2 h after dosing, at a time when
plasma inhibitor levels are maximal (see fig. 6). in contrast,
 xxxd2186xxx  (iressa), a potent and selective  xxxd1256xxx , inhibited egfr phosphorylation. in similar experiments (fig. 7b),
 xxxd3264xxx  was able to inhibit  xxxg791xxx  phosphorylation. however,
in the experiment shown in fig. 7b, as well as in additional
studies (data not shown), inhibition of  xxxg791xxx  was variable and
only seen at plasma levels of ⬃800 ng/ml, which is much higher
than the ⬃100 ng/ml required to inhibit  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1710xxx ␤ (see above).

discussion
there is great hope that molecularly targeted therapies such
as rtk inhibitors will offer a new and substantially different
approach to the treatment of human cancers. this approach
focuses on using agents to selectively target susceptible aspects
of tumor biology whereas having relatively little effect on
normal adult physiological functions. however, a key component of this scenario depends on the ability to identify clini-

cally relevant doses that provide maximum efficacy, rather than
relying on identification of a mtd to guide dosing as has been
done for conventional cytotoxic agents.
whereas the potential of such a strategy is well recognized,
it has been challenging to reduce this to practice. even in the
case of gleevec (sti-571), a  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  inhibitor that has demonstrated potent activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, the phase ii clinical dose was derived from a typical
phase i study designed to identify the mtd (26). however,
because gleevec caused such rapid and easily detected responses in patients (i.e., decrease in blast counts), it was possible to identify a biologically active dose to take forward into
registrational studies (26). retrospectively, it has been possible
to demonstrate that plasma levels of the inhibitor achieved at
efficacious doses in patients were similar to those achieved at
efficacious doses in preclinical models (27).
similarly, the phase ii dose for iressa ( xxxd2186xxx ), a potent
 xxxd1256xxx , has been selected based on determination of an
mtd. however, it should be noted that elegant functional
studies to identify a biomarker based on inhibition of mitogenactivated protein kinase activity in skin punch biopsies were
conducted during the phase i trials with this compound (28).
consequently, functional data have confirmed that the dose
selected from the phase i study did inhibit the target, or at least
downstream signaling events (mitogen-activated protein kinase
activation) influenced by inhibiting the target (egfr).
the primary goal of the studies described in this report was
to prospectively identify in preclinical models the pk/pd factors that contribute to the efficacy of a selective rtk inhibitor,
 xxxd3264xxx , targeting the vegf and pdgf receptors. this was
accomplished by thoroughly evaluating the extent and duration
of target receptor inhibition in vivo at efficacious, subefficacious, and nonefficacious doses of  xxxd3264xxx . the ultimate goal
of these studies was to determine pharmacokinetic exposures
required to drive efficacy in the clinical setting to guide dose
selection during phase i studies.
as indicated above,  xxxd3264xxx  selectively inhibits signaling
through the split kinase domain vegf, pdgf, kit and  xxxg801xxx 
receptors. thus,  xxxd3264xxx  is able to exert direct antitumor
activity against tumor cells that rely on these rtks for proliferation and/or survival, but is also able to indirectly inhibit
tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis. most of the tumor cell
lines used for the efficacy studies reported here do not express
rtks targeted by  xxxd3264xxx . thus, it is likely that the pk/pd
relationship described here is related to the anti-angiogenic
activity of  xxxd3264xxx  resulting from inhibition of the vegf and
pdgf receptors.
thus, the most important finding from these studies was
the determination that in athymic mice 50 –100 ng/ml is the
minimum plasma concentration of inhibitor required to inhibit
phosphorylation of vegf and pdgf receptors, the primary
targets responsible for the antiangiogenic activity of  xxxd3264xxx .
because the plasma protein binding of  xxxd3264xxx  is comparable
in plasma from athymic mice and humans, we would expect to
inhibit these targets in patients administered  xxxd3264xxx  if we
achieve a plasma inhibitor concentration of 50 –100 ng/ml.
results from these and other studies also indicate that  xxxd3264xxx 
retains its selectivity versus other rtks at these plasma levels,
as indicated by the observation that fgfr and egfr phospho-

rylation were not substantially inhibited in athymic mice even at
plasma levels ⬃10-fold higher than the 100 ng/ml target.
the other primary finding from this study was that it is not
necessary to maintain continuous inhibition of the target receptors to achieve efficacy in the murine models. at an efficacious
dose (e.g., 40 mg/kg/day),  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation was substantially inhibited for at least 12 h, but recovered
by the 24 h time point, before the next dosing. this result
confirms and extends our previous findings with su6668, a
different rtk inhibitor that targets the vegf, pdgf, and fgf
receptors (13). thus, based on the observation that both vegf
and pdgf receptor phosphorylation recovered by the end of the
dosing period for both  xxxd3264xxx  and su6668, we conclude that
substantial inhibition of the targets is not always required for
agents targeting the vegf and pdgf receptor pathways to
achieve complete or near complete efficacy. if, however, substantial inhibition of the targets is not maintained for at least half
the dosing period, as is observed at the 20 mg/kg dose of
 xxxd3264xxx , there is a reduction in efficacy. not surprisingly,
when there is only a transient inhibition of the targets, such as
is seen at the 5 mg/kg doses of  xxxd3264xxx , efficacy is very poor.
on the basis of the two primary findings from this study,
we would predict that in patients, doses of  xxxd3264xxx  sufficient
to produce plasma concentrations of 50 –100 ng/ml for at least
12 h of a 24-h dosing interval would lead to inhibition of the
target receptors sufficient to result in biological activity. conversely, if we achieve and sustain substantially higher plasma
concentrations in patients and show inhibition of target phosphorylation in the absence of biological activity, we would need
to question the role of the targets in the pathophysiology of the
disease. we recognize that the shape of the plasma concentration-time curve of  xxxd3264xxx  is likely to vary somewhat between
species. however, the plasma level required to inhibit target
rtks and the duration of inhibition required to achieve anti
tumor efficacy are independent of the shape of this curve and
should therefore be translatable into the clinic.
in considering the results of this study, it is important to
recognize that conclusions related to the duration of inhibition
required to achieve efficacy are specific to a compound targeting this process (angiogenesis) by inhibiting these receptors
(vegf and pdgf receptors). it is possible, and even likely, that
there would be a different requirement for angiogenesis inhibitors targeting other receptors (ref. 29; e.g., tie 2 or vegf
receptor alone). it is also possible that a different pk/pd relationship (e.g., potentially reduced target plasma concentration
and duration of inhibition) would be identified in models in
which  xxxd3264xxx  has direct antitumor activity through inhibition
of an rtk(s) expressed on the tumor cell and required for
survival (e.g.,  xxxg801xxx  or kit on some leukemias). in this respect,
the observation in the present study that a similar dose-response
effect for  xxxd3264xxx  was seen in a variety of different xenograft
models has raised our confidence that the pk/pd relationship
identified is likely to be broadly applicable to a variety of tumor
settings in which  xxxd3264xxx  is acting primarily to inhibit angiogenesis.
one key factor that has enabled us to perform these studies
with  xxxd3264xxx  was the demonstration that this compound
has predictable, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, with dosedependent changes in exposure evaluated based on either total

exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) or
maximum plasma concentrations. in addition, we have been
able to demonstrate that  xxxd3264xxx  does not covalently associate
with its target rtks, and that the biological effects of  xxxd3264xxx 
in vivo are evident only when inhibitor is present at active
concentrations in the plasma. consequently we have not had to
pursue more elaborate studies to identify a pk/pd relationship
based on cmax exposures or long lasting biological activity.
in summary, we have outlined in this report an approach of
elucidating pk/pd relationships in preclinical models to determine target plasma concentrations and duration of target inhibition required to achieve efficacy to aid in the clinical development of targeted therapies. although the studies reported here
specifically identify a pk/pd relationship for the antiangiogenic
activity of  xxxd3264xxx  mediated by selective inhibition of vegf
and pdgf receptors, this approach should be easily adapted to
other targeted therapies as long as in vivo models and techniques
to directly assess compound effect in these models are available.
the ultimate validation of this approach will be based on how
well the results of this study predict the target exposure (50 –100
ng/ml for 12 h of a 24-h dosing interval) for  xxxd3264xxx , which is
currently in phase i clinical trials.
