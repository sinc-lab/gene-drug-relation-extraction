abstract
it has been suggested that abnormal function of the serotonergic system may be implicated in the pathophysiology
of schizophrenia. in order to examine the role of this system in schizophrenia, we have determined 5-ht2a receptors
on human platelets of 20 control subjects and 37 schizophrenic patients by using w 3 hxspiperone and  xxxd2419xxx . the
data showed that the maximum number ž bmax . of 5-ht2a receptors for schizophrenic patients without neuroleptic
therapy was significantly higher than that for control subjects. the bmax values for w 3 hxspiperone binding to platelets
of schizophrenic patients on butyrophenone, phenothiazine, benzisoxazole and thioxanthene therapies were significantly lower than those obtained from the drug-free group, but were comparable to control values. the effect of
various medication periods on platelet 5-ht2a receptors was also examined. we found that after 2᎐4 weeks, 1᎐4
months, 4᎐12 months and more than 1 year of neuroleptic treatments, the bmax values were significantly decreased
when compared with values in the drug-free group. the present results indicate that treatment with various types of
neuroleptics decreases the hypersensitivity of platelet 5-ht2a receptors. significant clinical improvements occurred
in all types of neuroleptic-treated groups and for all different treatment durations in this study. the precise
mechanisms of how neuroleptics achieve their therapeutic effects still need to be further delineated. 䊚 2000 elsevier

1. introduction
schizophrenia is one of the most important
forms of psychiatric illness, but its cause remains
mysterious. among the various hypotheses put
forth to account for the etiology of schizophrenia,
the neurochemical imbalance hypothesis has recently gained marked acceptance žashton, 1992..
the search for an underlying neurochemical disorder has gone on, despite so-far unsuccessful
attempts to discover specific biochemical abnormalities in schizophrenic patients, the hope being
that a biochemical understanding of the mechanism would provide the basis for a rational drug
treatment. in fact, the biochemical theories have
come mainly from analysis of the actions of drugs
found by chance to be effective, rather than vice
versa.
serotonin ž5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht. is a
neurotransmitter that is widely distributed
throughout the central nervous system. the role
of 5-ht in schizophrenia is still unclear. a rapidly
growing body of data suggests that serotonergic
dysfunction may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and that pharmacological
agents for this illness have their therapeutic effects mediated through a serotonergic mechanism
žohuoha et al., 1993; breier, 1995..
because of biochemical and morphological
similarities between blood platelets and central
5-ht synaptosomes, and because of data showing
that virtually all 5-ht in blood is associated with
the platelets, platelets have been widely used as a
minimally invasive means of studying 5-ht in the
central nervous system žpletscher, 1988.. in addition, platelets offer a suitable peripheral source
for studying 5-ht2a receptors in living human
subjects because pharmacological properties of
platelet 5-ht2a receptors are similar to those of
brain 5-ht2a receptors želliott and kent, 1989;
andres et al., 1993.. moreover, it is also possible
that the 5-ht2a receptors in both platelets and
the brain are under the same genetic control
žroy, 1986.. recently, cook et al. ž1994. cloned
human platelet 5-ht2a receptors and the nucleotide sequence of human 5-ht2a cdna. the
sequence is identical to that reported for human
frontal cortex 5-ht2a receptors, except for nu-

cleotide 120. these data suggest that the regulation of 5-ht2a receptors at the gene level may be
the same in both platelets and brain. a cdna
encoding the human platelet 5-ht uptake site
has been isolated and sequenced. it has been
demonstrated that the human platelet 5-ht uptake site is identical to the human brain 5-ht
transporter žlesch et al., 1993.. identification of a
similar gene for 5-ht2a receptors and 5-ht uptake sites in platelets and brain suggests that the
study of serotonergic dysfunction in platelets is a
useful model for such dysfunctions in the brain.
this study attempts to investigate the pharmacology of 5-ht2a serotonin receptors on human
blood platelets and their relevance to the
pathogenesis of schizophrenia. knowledge is
sought in this study to better understand the role
of serotonin in schizophrenia, which may then be
used as a basis to select the most appropriate
neuroleptic drugs for schizophrenic patients.

2.1. chemicals
w 3 hxspiperone žspecific activity 22 cirmmol.
was purchased from amersham international
žamersham, uk..  xxxd2419xxx  was a gift from the
janssen research foundation žbeerse, belgium..
all other chemicals used were of the purest
commercially available grade, purchased mainly
from e. merck ždarmstadt, germany. and sigma
chemical company žst. louis, mo.. all solutions
containing the drugs were freshly prepared for
each experiment.
2.2. subjects
schizophrenic patients diagnosed according to
dsm-iv criteria žamerican psychiatric association, 1994. from the psychiatric clinic, wachira
and phra mongkutklao hospitals were studied
after having given informed consent. this study
was approved by the mahidol university ethics
committee and performed in accordance with
ethical standards laid down in the 1964 declaration of helsinki. complete medical and family

p. go¨ itrapong et al. r psychiatry research 96 (2000) 41᎐50

histories were obtained from the patients and
informants when available. behavioral ratings
were completed with the brief psychiatric rating
scale žbprs, overall and gorham, 1962.. nine
patients ž6 males and 3 females. received butyrophenones žhaloperidol, haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx  or
bromperidol., 10 ž5 males and 5 females. received
phenothiazines žtrifluoperazine, chlorpromazine,
fluphenazine or perphenazine., 7 ž3 males and 4
females. received benzisoxazole žrisperidone. and
6 ž4 males and 2 females. received thioxanthenes
ž cis- xxxd2137xxx , cis- xxxd2137xxx   xxxd1821xxx .. the
drug-free group consisted of schizophrenic
patients who had never received any neuroleptic
drug before blood sampling. all patients had not
made any recent suicide attempt. healthy adults
were recruited as a control group. they had no
history of neurological or psychiatric illness, including no serious or infectious diseases such as
hivraids or hepatitis, they were drug-free, and
they were matched with the schizophrenic patients
for age.
2.3. platelet membrane preparation
blood ž15᎐20 ml. was taken from the antecubital vein with a 21-gauge needle into plastic syringes and transferred to plastic centrifuge tubes
containing 0.38% žfinal concentration . sodium
citrate as the anticoagulant. platelet-rich plasma
žprp. was obtained by centrifugation at 200 = g
for 20 min. prp was isolated and mixed with half
of its original volume of ice-cold 50 mm tris᎐hcl
žph 7.5. and homogenized for 15 s with a polytron žultra turrax t25. at 13 500 rev.rmin. the
suspension was centrifuged at 40 000 = g for 20
min at 4⬚c in a refrigerated centrifuge ždoupont,
sorvall rc 26 plus.. the supernatant was decanted and the membrane pellet was resuspended
in 20 volumes of 50 mm tris᎐hcl žph 7.5.,
homogenized and centrifuged at 40 000 = g for 20
min. the final pellet was kept frozen at y80⬚c
until used, usually within 2 weeks.

43

the membrane pellets were resuspended in 15 ml
of ice-cold 50 mm tris᎐hcl buffer, ph 7.5 žcontaining: 120 mm nacl; 5 mm kcl; 2 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 ;
and 1 mm mgcl 2 . and homogenized for 15 s with
a polytron žultra turrax t25. at 13 500 rev.rmin.
the w 3 hxspiperone binding assays were performed by the addition of 400 ␮l platelet membrane suspension žto give a final protein concentration of 0.1᎐0.2 mgrml. into plastic tubes, which
contained 50 ␮l incubation buffer either with or
without 100 ␮m  xxxd2419xxx  in the buffer. the
reactions were started by adding 50 ␮l of
w 3 hxspiperone to give a final concentration of
0.2᎐10 nm in a final incubation volume of 0.5 ml.
 xxxd2419xxx  ž100 ␮m. was chosen for the displacing agent to define non-specific binding. the assay mixtures were incubated at 37⬚c for 30 min,
during which time binding equilibrium was
reached. the reaction was terminated by rapidly
filtering the reaction mixture through whatman
gfrc filters under vacuum. the filters were
washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm
tris᎐hcl buffer žph 7.5.. the filters were dried,
and receptor-bound radioactivity trapped on the
filters was counted in 5 ml of scintillation fluid
containing triton x-100rtoluene base flour ž1:3.
by a scintillation counter žbeckman ls.1800.. the
counting efficiency for tritium was approximately
45%. specific w 3 hxspiperone binding accounted
for 40᎐60% of the total binding.
2.5. data analysis
saturation curves were analyzed by using the
nonlinear least-squared regression analysis computer program, ligand žmunson and robard,
1980.. the dissociation equilibrium constant ž k d .
and the maximum number of binding sites ž bmax .
were obtained. the data are expressed as mean "
s.d. derived from n experiments indicated and
were analyzed by anova, and then statistical
evaluation of the results was performed by using
the tukey᎐kramer multiple comparison test.

2.4. determination of 5-ht2 a receptor binding

4. discussion
4.1. platelet 5-ht2 a binding in unmedicated
schizophrenic patients
the present data show that the maximum number of 5-ht2a binding sites ž bmax . is significantly
higher in the blood platelets of unmedicated
schizophrenic patients compared with normal
control subjects. these results were compatible
with several previous reports. for example,
pandey et al. ž1993. reported that the bmax of
w 125 ixlsd binding to 5-ht2 receptors in platelets
of unmedicated schizophrenic patients was significantly higher than that in normal control subjects, and that there was no significant difference
in the k d values between schizophrenic patients
and normal control subjects. an increase of 5-ht2
binding ž bmax . in blood platelets žarora and
meltzer, 1993; hrdina et al., 1997. and in brain
žarango et al., 1992; hrdina et al., 1993. has been
found both in schizophrenic patients who had
made suicide attempts and in non-suicidal
schizophrenic patients compared with normal
control subjects. postmortem studies also indicated significantly higher cortical w 3 hxlsd binding in unmedicated chronic schizophrenic patients
who had been drug-free for 1 year before death
žwhitaker et al., 1981.. joyce et al. ž1993., using

p. go¨ itrapong et al. r psychiatry research 96 (2000) 41᎐50

quantitative receptor autoradiography, reported
an increase of w 125 ixlsd and w 3 hxketanserinlabeled 5-ht2 receptors in the temporal and posterior cingulate, frontal and parietal cortices, the
ventral putamen, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. in contrast, 5-ht2 receptors in postmortem brains of unmedicated schizophrenic
patients were decreased in the reports of bennett
et al. ž1979., mita et al. ž1986., and arora and
meltzer ž1991., whereas they were unchanged in
the reports of mackay et al. ž1978. and reynolds
et al. ž1983..
data supporting receptor hypersensitivity in
schizophrenic patients may also be obtained from
the  xxxg1113xxx -mediated signal transduction
system. das et al. ž1994. reported that resting
platelets from schizophrenic patients contained a
significantly increased amount of pip2 compared
with controls. the agonist-stimulated hydrolysis
of pip2 in platelets from the schizophrenic group
was also significantly greater than that in platelets
from the control group. pip2 plays an important

47

role in cell signaling, and the observed changes
may reflect an abnormality in signal transduction
mediated through the 5-ht2a -receptor event.
4.2. platelet 5-ht2 a receptor in schizophrenic
patients with different classes of neuroleptic
treatments
the maximum numbers ž bmax . of 5-ht2a receptors in schizophrenic patients under different
neuroleptic žbutyrophenone, phenothiazine, benzisoxazole and thioxanthene . treatments were significantly reduced when compared with the
unmedicated group. these values were comparable to those in normal control subjects.
our results are in agreement with several previous studies. for example, there was no difference in bmax value of 5-ht2 binding sites in
frontal cortex found in medicated schizophrenic
patients žmackay et al., 1978; owen et al., 1981;
reynolds et al., 1983; mita et al., 1986; laruelle
et al., 1991.. pandey et al. ž1993. examined the

effect of treatment with neuroleptics on platelet
5-ht2 receptors, and found that neither treatment with haloperidol nor treatment with  xxxd3359xxx  caused a significant change in platelet
 xxxg1113xxx  bmax and k d of w 125 ixlsd binding. however, both fluphenazine and  xxxd3431xxx  significantly increased the bmax of w 125 ixlsd
binding without any significant change in k d values. schachter et al. ž1985. reported increased
platelet  xxxg1113xxx  numbers in schizophrenic
patients who had been treated with depot phenothiazine for long periods, but not in patients who
were receiving non-phenothiazine neuroleptics. it
has been reported that chronic treatment with
chlorpromazine and thioridazine, but not
haloperidol, causes down-regulation of 5-ht2 receptors in rat brain žperoutka and snyder, 1980;
andree et al., 1986.. in addition, meltzer et al.
ž1989. reported in a study on the effect of acute
treatment with seven atypical and four typical
antipsychotic drugs on 5-ht2a receptors in rat
cerebral cortex, that clozapine, fluperlapine,
rmi-81582 and setoperone decreased the density
of 5-ht2a receptors, but  xxxd162xxx  and melperone did not.  xxxd2511xxx  decreased the bmax and
increased the k d of 5-ht2a receptors whereas
chlorpromazine and cis- xxxd2137xxx  had no effect
žmeltzer et al., 1989.. hashimoto et al. ž1991.
reported that  xxxg1113xxx  binding in human
brain was decreased, when compared with that in
control subjects. this occurred in both patients
who were receiving neuroleptic medication at the
time of death and in those who had not had such
treatment for at least 2 months prior to death.
the bmax values of 5-ht2a binding in patients
who were treated with haloperidol in our study
were markedly reduced when compared with the
unmedicated group, and slightly reduced when
compared with normal control subjects. the present data are comparable to those reported by
whitaker et al. ž1981., who suggested that decreased 5-ht2a receptors in the postmortem
brains of schizophrenic patients might be due to
previous neuroleptic exposure. the reduction in
receptor density ž bmax . was probably due to the
effect of neuroleptic treatment that induced a
decrease in the receptor numbers to control levels. concomitantly, an improvement was observed

in patients after receiving neuroleptics. taken
together, it is reasonable to assume that agents
that are thought to decrease 5-ht function have
shown antipsychotic effects, particularly when potent 5-ht2 antagonists have been used.
the pharmacological activities of haloperidol
and other typical neuroleptics have long been
considered to depend upon the blockade of d 2
dopamine receptors, whereas the ‘atypical’ neuroleptics show a higher occupancy of 5-ht2a than
d 2 receptors. two recent studies žkapur, 1998;
trichard et al., 1998. of cortical 5-ht2a binding
using positron emission tomography and
w 18 fxsetoperone found that both clozapine and
high doses of chlorpromazine blocked the 5-ht2a
receptor, suggesting that the distinct clinical profiles of both drugs were unrelated to 5-ht2a
blockade itself. the present finding suggests that
haloperidol might affect the serotonergic system
as well. in addition, elucidating the interactions
between several neurotransmitter systems might
lead to a significantly better understanding of the
psychopathologic mechanisms in schizophrenia.
4.3. platelet 5-ht2 a receptors in ¨ arious periods of
neuroleptic treatments.
a study of platelet  xxxg1113xxx  binding in
various durations of neuroleptic treatment was
also performed. different groups of schizophrenic
patients who had been under neuroleptic treatment for 2᎐4 weeks, 1᎐4 months, 4᎐12 months
and more than 1 year were studied. the results
indicated lower bmax values in patients who received neuroleptic drugs for every treatment period, when compared with drug-free patients. after 2᎐4 weeks of medication, the  xxxg1113xxx 
numbers declined to normal control levels. furthermore, the number of 5-ht2a receptors in the
4᎐12-month period, was further reduced to a
level that was significantly lower than normal
control subjects. however, after more than 1 year
of treatment, the  xxxg1113xxx  numbers were
restored close to control levels again. presumably,
agents that are thought to decrease 5-ht functions have shown antipsychotic effects, and then
the therapeutic efficacy was reached within a
short period of treatment.

obviously, the presumed dysfunction of each
neurotransmitter system should be considered in
relation to the dynamic interactions among the
systems rather than as independent processes.
optimal pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia might
include both 5-ht antagonist and dopamineblocking components, the former being more
beneficial for negative symptoms and the latter
for overt psychotic symptoms. this type of perspective might offer a greater promise in treating
a disorder that has so far proved to be resistant.
it is conceivable then that the alterations of 5ht2a receptors and receptor activity measured in
schizophrenic patients could be due to abnormalities of dopaminergic neurotransmission which occur during early brain development žbenes, 1995..
in conclusion, an increase in 5-ht2a receptors
has been found in unmedicated schizophrenic
patients, typical and atypical antipsychotic agents
bind with high affinity to 5-ht2a receptors, and
then the reduced 5-ht2a receptors presumably
produce antipsychotic effects. a reduction of
platelet 5-ht2a receptors in schizophrenic
patients could be seen after a short period of
neuroleptic administration, concomitant with an
improved symptomatic appearance in schizophrenic patients. further studies to examine the
role of multiple serotonin receptors in the etiopathology andror treatment of schizophrenia are
likely to yield productive results. the recent
cloning of the cdnas for various  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes provides an opportunity to explore
the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
alterations in these receptors during illness, as
well as for pharmacotherapy. detailed examinations of other factors, e.g. platelet monoamine
oxidase activity žzureick and meltzer, 1988.,
andror interactions among several neurotransmitter systems, may lead to a significantly better
understanding of the psychopathogenic mechanisms involved in schizophrenia.
