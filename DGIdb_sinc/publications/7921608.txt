in conscious rats

1 regional haemodynamic responses to endothelin (et)-i, -2 and -3 and big et-1 (all at
500 pmol kg-') were assessed in the same conscious long evans rats (n = 8) in the absence or presence
of the mixed eta-, etb-receptor antagonist, ro47-0203 ( xxxd358xxx ; 30mgkg-').
2  xxxd358xxx  blocked the initial depressor, tachycardic and hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator effects
of et-1, -2 and -3, and substantially curtailed the primary renal and secondary hindquarters vasoconstrictor responses.  xxxd358xxx  did not inhibit the initial mesenteric vasoconstrictor action of et-1, but
reduced the duration of the later mesenteric vasoconstriction. in contrast,  xxxd358xxx  delayed the rate of
onset, and reduced the duration, of the mesenteric vasoconstrictor actions of et-2 and  xxxg675xxx . the most
likely explanation of this finding is that et-1, but not et-2 or  xxxg675xxx , triggered a covert mesenteric
vasodilator mechanism which was antagonized by  xxxd358xxx .
3  xxxd358xxx  blocked all the effects of big et-1, and, in a separate group of rats (n = 7), blocked all the
haemodynamic effects of a lower dose of et-l (50 pmol kg-'), with the exception of a slight mesenteric
vasoconstriction.
4 the most straightforward explanation of the results is that the major haemodynamic effects of et-1,
-2 and -3, and all the effects of big et-1, are mediated through eta- and/or etb-receptors that are
effectively antagonized by  xxxd358xxx .

introduction
recent findings indicate that, while exogenous endothelin

(et)-l, and its analogues elicit initial depressor and vasodilator effects by activating etb-receptors, the subsequent
pressor and vasoconstrictor actions of these peptides may
involve both eta- and etb-receptors (hiley et al., 1989;
randall, 1991; bigaud & pelton, 1992; clozel et al., 1992;
gardiner et al., 1992b; moreland et al., 1992; cristol et al.,
1993; mcmurdo et al., 1993; warner et al., 1993).
these obervations raise the possibility that selective etareceptor antagonists would be less useful than non-selective,
eta-, etb-receptor antagonists in pathophysiological conditions in which impairment of regional blood flow was due to
endogenous endothelin(s) (see battistini et al., 1993, for
review). recently, clozel et al. (1993) demonstrated the
ability of the non-selective eta-, etb-receptor antagonist,
ro 46-2005 (4-tert-butyl-n- [6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(3-methoxy-phenoxy)-4-pyrimidinyl]-benzenesulphonamide), to inhibit the decrease in renal blood flow following renal
ischaemia, and also the cerebral vasospasm following
subarachnoid haemorrhage in anaesthetized rats. in those
models, ro 46-2005 was without effect on systemic arterial
blood pressure. however, ro 46-2005 at a dose of 100 mg
kg-i caused a prolonged fall (30-40 mmhg) in mean arterial
blood pressure in conscious,  xxxd2167xxx -treated, squirrel
monkeys. collectively, these results indicate that endogenous
ets may contribute to vasospasm in pathological conditions,
and to the maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure in
sodium depletion. however, at present, no data are available
regarding the ability of non-selective eta-, etb-receptor
antagonists to influence the regional haemodynamic actions
of ets.
therefore, in the present work, we assessed regional

haemodynamic responses to et-1, et-2 and  xxxg675xxx , and big
et-1 in the absence and presence of the non-peptide, nonselective, eta-, and etb-receptor antagonist,  xxxd358xxx  (i.e.,
 xxxd358xxx ; 4-tert-butyl-n-[6-(2-hydroxy)-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2, 2'-bipyrimidin-4yl] -benzenesulphonamide)
(clozel et al., 1994).

methods
male long evans rats (350-450 g), bred in the biomedical
services unit, queen's medical centre, nottingham, were
chronically instrumented with pulsed doppler flow probes
(renal, mesenteric and hindquarters) and intravascular catheters as described in detail previously (gardiner et al., 1991;
1992a). all surgery was carried out under sodium  xxxd2599xxx  anaesthesia ( xxxd2599xxx , lilly; 40-60 mgkg-', i.p., supplemented as required). experiments were not begun until at
least 24 h after the last surgical intervention.
one group of animals (n = 8) was randomized to receive
i.v. bolus doses of et-1, et-2,  xxxg675xxx  and big et-1 (all at
500 pmol kg-') on separate experimental days, before and
5 min after i.v. bolus injection of  xxxd358xxx  (30 mg kg-'). the
peptide injections on any experimental day were separated by
at least 7 h; in pilot experiments we determined that repeated
peptide injections at this interval evoked reproducible responses. the dose of the peptides was based on preliminary
experiments showing that it evoked reproducible responses
with respect to all components (see results); the dose of
 xxxd358xxx  was based on previous studies (clozel et al., 1994).
since  xxxd358xxx  did not abolish all the effects of the peptides
(see results), in a second group of animals (n = 7), responses
to et-1 at a 10 fold lower dose, i.e., 50pmol kg-', were
assessed before and 5 min after i.v. bolus injection of  xxxd358xxx .

data analysis

~ *2

during an experimental run, continuous recordings were
made of instantaneous heart rate, and mean and phasic
arterial blood pressure and doppler shift signals. vascular
conductance was calculated (mean doppler shift divided by

mean arterial blood pressure), and changes in all variables
relative to baseline were used to assess responses to peptides.
for et-1, et-2 and  xxxg675xxx  at 500 pmol kg-', measurements
were made at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
and 60 min after injection. for big et-1, measurements were
made 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 min after

baseline; responses in the absence and presence of  xxxd358xxx 
were compared by applying wilcoxon's ranks sums test to
integrated responses (areas under or over curves auco-60

followed with the lower dose of et-1 (50 pmol kg-'), except
that measurements were made only up to 10 min postinjection, since most variables were back to baseline levels by
then. a p value <0.05 was taken as significant.

and bradycardic effects associated with reductions in renal,
mesenteric and hindquarters flows and vascular conductances
(figure 1, table 2).
when  xxxd358xxx  was injected, the majority of animals
showed an alerting response and motor activity (such effects
were not seen with vehicle injection). the motor activity was
accompanied by a transient (less than 5 min) rise in heart
rate and mean arterial blood pressure, but no reductions in
regional blood flows. hence, the pressor effect of  xxxd358xxx 
was probably due to an activity-induced increase in cardiac
output, and clearly was not an agonistic effect of the drug at
et-receptors, consisent with the findings of clozel et al.
(1994).
in the presence of  xxxd358xxx , the initial depressor and
tachycardic, and the hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator
effects of et-1, were abolished (figure 1, table 2). although
the early (within 1 min) renal vasoconstrictor effect of et-l
was attenuated (+  xxxd358xxx , a maximum vascular conductance = - 15 ± 3 khz mmhg-'103;- xxxd358xxx , a maximum
= -49 ± 8 khz mmhg' 103), the mesenteric vasoconstrictor
response was not (figure 1); however, the subsequent renal,
mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstrictor effects of et-1,
together with its pressor and bradycardic actions were all
attenuated by  xxxd358xxx  (figure 1, table 2). nevertheless, in
the presence of  xxxd358xxx , et-1 still exerted significant cardiovascular effects (figure 1).

low dose et-j in the absence of  xxxd358xxx , the 50 pmol
kg-' dose of et-1 did not cause an initial depressor effect,
and there was only a slight tachycardia (figure 2). however,
there were early increases in hindquarters flow and vascular
conductance, in association with reductions in renal and
mesenteric flows and vascular conductances (figure 2, table
3). subsequently, there was a rise in mean arterial blood
pressure and a bradycardia, together with a slight hindquarters vasoconstriction, but this was not accompanied by a
reduction in flow (figure 2, table 3).
in the presence of  xxxd358xxx , the pressor, bradycardic and
renal and hindquarters haemodynamic effects of et-1 were
abolished. however, there were still significant, albeit slight,
reductions in mesenteric flow and vascular conductance
(figure 2, table 3).

responses to et-2 in the absence and presence of
 xxxd358xxx 
although the pattern of haemodynamic changes evoked by
et-2 (figure 3) was similar to that of et-i (figure 1), the
initial depressor, tachycardic and hindquarters hyperaemic
vasodilator effects of et-2 were significantly less than those
of et-l (table 2; compare figures 1 and 3), as was the
initial renal vasoconstrictor effect (et-2, a vascular conductance at 15 s =-9 ± 9 khz mmhg' 103; et-1=-29±2

khz mmhg-' 103). however, the initial mesenteric vasoconstrictor effect of et-2 (a vascular conductance at 15 s
=- 45 ± 5 khz mmhg'103) was significantly greater than

that of et-l (-6 ± 9 khz mmhg'103) (compare figures 1
and 3). the subsequent pressor, bradycardic, and renal and
mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of et-2 were less sustained
than those of et-1, and hence the integrated responses were
smaller (table 2).
in the presence of  xxxd358xxx , the initial depressor effect of
et-2 was abolished, and there was no significant tachycardia,
but since the responses in the absence of  xxxd358xxx  were
small, there was no statistically significant effect of  xxxd358xxx 
(table 2). likewise, the attentuation by  xxxd358xxx  of the
initial hyperaemic hindquarters vasodilator response to et-2
did not reach significance (figure 3, table 2). however, the
early renal vasoconstriction was abolished, and the initial
mesenteric vasoconstriction was attenuated ( +  xxxd358xxx , a
vascular conductance at 15 s = - 14 ± 4 khz mmhg- i 103)
(figure 3), and  xxxd358xxx  also reduced the durations of the
renal and mesenteric vasoconstriction, and abolished the
delayed hindquarters vasoconstriction (figure 3, table 2).

responses to  xxxg675xxx  in the absence and presence of
 xxxd358xxx 
the profile of haemodynamic effect of  xxxg675xxx  (figure 4) was
similar to that of et-2 and et-1, but compared to the latter,
the initial tachycardia and hindquarters vasodilator actions
of  xxxg675xxx  were less (table 2). moreover, there was a significant
difference between the early change in renal vascular conductance evoked by  xxxg675xxx  (a vascular conductance at 15 s
= 7±4khz mmhg-103) and that seen with et-1 (above),
whereas the early mesenteric vasoconstrictor effect of  xxxg675xxx 
(a vascular conductance at 15s= -41 ±9 khz mmhg-'
103) was greater than that of et-1 (above) (compare figures
4 and 1). the durations of the pressor, bradycardic, renal
vasoconstrictor effects, but not the mesenteric vasoconstrictor
effect of  xxxg675xxx , were less than those of et-1 (figure 4, table
2).
 xxxd358xxx  abolished the initial depressor and tachycardic
effects of  xxxg675xxx  (figure 4, table 2) and attenuated the early
renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictions (renal, a vascular
conductance at 1 min, +  xxxd358xxx  a = - 10 ± 2 khz mmhg-' 103i; -  xxxd358xxx  = -46 ± 5 khz mmhg-' 103; mesenteric, a vascular conductance at 15 s, +  xxxd358xxx  = - 19 ± 3
khz mmhg-' 103; -  xxxd358xxx  = -41 ± 9 khz mmhg-' 103
(figure 4, table 2).  xxxd358xxx  attenuated the subsequent
pressor and bradycardic effects of  xxxg675xxx , reduced the duration
of the renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses, and
abolished the delayed hindquarters vasoconstrictor action of
 xxxg675xxx  (figure 4, table 2).

response to big et-j in the absence and presence of
 xxxd358xxx 
big et-l evoked a slowly-developing pressor and bradycardic effect, accompanied by renal, mesenteric and hindquarters
vasoconstrictions (figure 5, table 2). big et-l thus differed
from et-1 in the absence of an initial depressor, tachycardic

figure 3 cardiovascular responses to endothelin-2 (et-2, 500 pmol kg-') in the absence (0) or presence (a) of  xxxd358xxx

the differences between the responses in the absence and presence of  xxxd358xxx  are given in the text and table 2.

and hindquarters vasodilator phase, although at a higher
dose (1o nmol kg-'), big et-1 has such effects (gardiner et
al., 1991). the integrated pressor and bradycardic, and
mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of big et-1 were not
different from those of et-1, but the latter had greater renal
vasoconstrictor and lesser hindquarters vasoconstrictor actions than did big et-l (figure 5, table 2).
 xxxd358xxx  abolished the pressor, and renal, and hindquarters vasoconstrictor effects of big et-1 (figure 5, table
2). in the presence of  xxxd358xxx  there were slight, delayed falls
in mean arterial blood pressure and mesenteric flow and
vascular conductance following administration of big et-1
(figure 5, table 2).

discussion
the major objectives of the present work were to assess the
effectiveness of  xxxd358xxx  as an antagonist of the regional
haemodynamic actions of et-1, -2 and -3 and big et-1 in
conscious rats and, in so doing, to determine if there were

residual responses to the peptides in the presence of  xxxd358xxx , consistent with involvement of non-eta-, non-etbreceptors.

effects of  xxxd358xxx 

on responses to

et-j

at a dose of 500 pmol kg-', et-l elicited a marked initial
hypotension, tachycardia and increases in hindquarters flow
and vascular conductance; all these effects were blocked by
 xxxd358xxx . furthermore, in the same experimental model, we
have found that the eta-receptor antagonist, fr 139317, has
no influence on these initial responses to et-1 (bennett et al.,
1993). thus, these results, together, are consistent with an
exclusive mediation of the hypotensive and hindquarters
hyperaemic vasodilator effects of et-l by etb-receptors; it is
likely that the tachycardia was a reflex response to the
hypotension (gardiner et al., 1990a).
although  xxxd358xxx  clearly attenuated the early renal
vasoconstrictor effect of et-1 at a dose of 500 pmol kg-', it
tended to enhance the initial vasoconstrictor response in the
mesenteric vascular bed. however, examination of the

figure 4 cardiovascular responses to  xxxg675xxx  ( xxxg675xxx , 500 pmol kg-') in the absence (0) or presence (a) of  xxxd358xxx 
(30 mg kg- ') in the same conscious, long evans rats (n = 8). values are mean ± s.e.mean; *p < 0.05 versus baseline. statistics for
the differences between the responses in the absence and presence of  xxxd358xxx  are given in the text and table 2.

changes in the arterial blood pressure and mesenteric blood
flow showed that this was due to  xxxd358xxx  blocking a covert
vasodilator component in this vascular bed that was acting to
oppose the vasoconstrictor effect of et-1. this interpretation
is consistent with the finding that et-l at a dose of
50 pmol kg-' had a rapid onset, mesenteric vasoconstrictor
effect, that was clearly inhibited by  xxxd358xxx . these observations indicate that, at a dose of 50 pmol kg-', et-1 had a
preferential mesenteric vasoconstrictor action, while at a dose
of 500 pmol kg-' addition mesenteric vasodilator mechanisms were activated by et-1. it is feasible that the different
pattern of haemodynamic changes in mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds in response to et-1, and the effect of
 xxxd358xxx  thereupon, reflected different distributions of etaand etb-receptors in the two vascular beds.
it is difficult to argue that  xxxd358xxx  more effectively
blocked etb- than eta-receptors, if the latter predominate
and, when activated, produce effects that oppose those due to
etb-receptor stimulation. by the same token, it is not possible, straightforwardly, to quantitate the effectiveness of
 xxxd358xxx  in blocking the pressor and vasoconstrictor effects

of et-1, since, in the absence of  xxxd358xxx , these actions were
functionally antagonized by the depressor and vasodilator
responses to et-1 (clozel et al., 1994). nonetheless, it was
clear that  xxxd358xxx  markedly attenuated the pressor, and
renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstrictor effects of
et-1 at a dose of 500 pmol kg-'. because, in the latter
vascular bed, there was no reduction of flow in the presence
of  xxxd358xxx , it is possible that the vasoconstriction was an
autoregulatory response to the rise in the perfusion pressure.
although  xxxd358xxx  clearly shortened the duration of the
pressor and vasoconstrictor effects, and diminished the maximum responses to et-1 at a dose of 500 pmol kg-',
significant responses remained. it is feasible that these were
due to the involvement of receptors other than those of the
eta- or etb-receptor subtype (see huggins et al., 1993, for
review). however, since  xxxd358xxx  is a competitive antagonist
(clozel et al., 1994) it is possible that the dose of  xxxd358xxx 
was insufficient to inhibit fully the haemodynamic effects of
this high dose of et-1. therefore, we assessed the effectiveness of  xxxd358xxx  against a lower dose of et-1 (50 pmol
kg-'). under these conditions,  xxxd358xxx  blocked all the

 xxxd358xxx  and endothelin responses

effects of et-1, except for small reductions in mesenteric flow
and vascular conductance. thus, it seems likely that the
majority of the effects of et-l were mediated through etaand/or etb-receptors. however, we cannot dismiss an action
of  xxxd358xxx  at other subtypes of et receptors, in addition to
eta- or etb-receptors. as mentioned above, it is feasible
that, particularly at a dose of 500 pmol kg-', et-1 activated
other et-receptor subtypes in addition to eta- and etbreceptors. such a possibility is consistent with the finding that
the maximum bradycardic effect of et-1 was less inhibited
by  xxxd358xxx  than was its maximum pressor effect (see tables
2 and 3). since the chronotropic actions of et-l are blocked
by atropine and atenolol (gardiner et al., 1990a), it is feasible that any putative, non-eta-, non-etb-receptor-mediated
influence of et-1 on heart rate might be mediated through
modulating cardiac autonomic control, possibly by an effect
on baroreflex sensitivity.

had more rapid onset vasoconstrictor actions in the mesenteric vascular bed than did et-1, although this was not the
case in the renal vascular bed. thus, with the exception of
the latter, we here, and previously (gardiner et al., 1990b,
c,d), have not found in vivo functional evidence for more
effective activation of vasodilator mechanisms, by et- 3 or
et-2, than by et-1.
in the majority of instances there was no evidence
indicating that  xxxd358xxx  was less effective at inhibiting the
actions of et-2 or  xxxg675xxx  than those of et-1. hence, our
results are generally consistent with the proposal that the
majority of the effects of et-1, -2 and -3 are mediated
through eta- and/or etb-receptors. the one apparent exception was the hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator responses
to et-2 and  xxxg675xxx  which, unlike those to et-1, were not
completely blocked by  xxxd358xxx . however, these responses
were so small their functional significance is doubtful.

all the effects of big et-1 over the first o min after its

s.m. gardiner et al.

in the presence of  xxxd358xxx , there were slight reductions in
mean arterial blood pressure and renal and mesenteric flows,
and mesenteric vascular conductance. considering the time
course of these changes, it is likely they were due to the
waning of the initial effects of  xxxd358xxx  (see results), rather
than to residual actions of big et-1 in the presence of
 xxxd358xxx . since  xxxd358xxx  so effectively blocked all the actions
of big et-1, it seems likely that the latter exerts its effects
through eta- and/or etb-receptors. while this probably
occurs after the local conversion of big et-1 to et-1 (gardiner et al., 1991), it has been suggested that unprocessed big
et-1 may also exert haemodynamic effects (douglas &
hiley, 1991). if this is the case, then these actions appear to
be mediated through eta- and/or etb-receptors, or possibly
through another et-receptor subtype that is antagonized by
 xxxd358xxx . although it is theoretically possible that  xxxd358xxx 
could have inhibited the haemodynamic effects of big et-1

by preventing the generation of et-1, clozel et al. (1994)
have reported that  xxxd358xxx  does not inhibit endothelin converting enzyme.
in conclusion,  xxxd358xxx  is an effective antagonist of the in
vivo haemodynamic effects of et-1, -2 and -3, and big et-1
in conscious rats. since previous studies have shown  xxxd358xxx  has no effect on responses to many substances, including
catecholamines, prostanoids, angiotensin and vasopressin
(clozel et al., 1994), this compound will be a powerful tool
for discerning the putative role of endothelins in cardiovascular pathophysiology.

we are extremely grateful to dr martine clozel (f. hoffmann
laroche ltd.) for the gift of  xxxd358xxx , and for useful discussions of
the work herein.
