abstract

purpose: the  xxxg2413xxx  receptor-2 ( xxxg1274xxx )  xxxg2198xxx  has
been implicated in the pathologic angiogenesis associated with tumor growth. ym-359445
was a (3z)-3-quinolin-2(1h)-ylidene-1,3-dihydro-2h-indol-2-one derivative found while
screening based on the inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx .the aim of this study was to analyze
the efficacy of this compound both in vitro and in vivo.
experimental design:we tested the effects ofym-359445 onvegfr2  xxxg2198xxx  activity,
cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. the antitumor activity of ym-359445 was also tested in
nude mice bearing various established tumors and compared with other  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors (zd6474, cp-547632,  xxxd3496xxx ,  xxxd3264xxx , and azd2171), a cytotoxic agent
(paclitaxel), and an  xxxg681xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (gefitinib).
results: the ic50 of ym-359445 for  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  was 0.0085 amol/l. in human
vascular endothelial cells, the compound inhibited vegf-dependent proliferation,  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation, and sprout formation at concentrations of 0.001 to 0.003 amol/l. these
concentrations had no direct cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. in mice bearing various established
tumors, including paclitaxel-resistant tumors, once daily oral administration of ym-359445
at doses of 0.5 to 4 mg/kg not only inhibited tumor growth but also reduced its vasculature.
ym-359445 had greater antitumor activity than other  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors.
moreover, in human lung cancer a549 xenografts, ym-359445 markedly regressed the tumors
(73%) at a dose of 4 mg/kg, whereas gefitinib caused no regression even at 100 mg/kg.
conclusion: our results show that ym-359445 is more potent than orally bioavailable  xxxg1274xxx 
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, which leads to great expectations for clinical applicability.

morbidity rate of cancer has been increasing remarkably in
recent decades, and the development of diagnostic rapid
capabilities has supported early detection and treatment.
although chemotherapy using anticancer drugs began >50
years ago, and the number of anticancer drugs has increased
considerably, the prognosis of most patients has not yet been
improved because of serious side effects or multidrug resistance
(1). as a means of overcoming these problems, antiangiogenesis therapy targeting the vascular endothelial cells in

tumors has attracted attention. this is because endothelial cells
rarely acquire resistance due to their genetic stability, but cancer
cells easily acquire resistance during chemotherapy through the
use of cytotoxic agents (2, 3).
angiogenesis is the complex process of forming new blood
vessels from the preexisting vessels that occurs due to many
physiologic and pathologic conditions (4, 5). the protrusion of
endothelial cells allows local degradation of the basement membrane of the parent vessel; then, endothelial cells migrate outward in tandem to form a capillary sprout. the cells then
proliferate followed by lumen formation with subsequent
branching; however, the exact sequence of events involved and
the regulation of angiogenesis remain unclear. in general, vascular proliferation occurs only during embryonic development
and, with few exceptions (e.g., wound healing and in the female
reproductive system), is a very slow process in the adult. in contrast, many pathologic conditions (e.g., cancer, atherosclerosis,
and diabetic retinopathy) are characterized by persistent, unregulated angiogenesis (6). therefore, experimental and clinical
investigators continue to seek to identify medicinal agents capable of inhibiting the process of angiogenesis. one approach is to
identify compounds that can retard vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) signaling cascade in vascular endothelial cells.

ym-359445: a  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

vegf is a key regulator of vascular functions and angiogenesis because it is a strong inducer of vascular permeability and
a stimulator of endothelial cell migration and proliferation
(7 – 10). vegf seems to be important for the formation of
ascites and pleural effusion in advanced cancer patients
(11, 12). moreover, vegf expression is associated with the
abnormal angiogenesis that occurs in diabetic retinopathy (13)
as well as with several kinds of cancers, such as colorectal,
gastric, pancreatic, breast, prostate, lung, and melanoma
(14 – 20). in the clinical setting, bevacizumab, a recombinant
humanized monoclonal antibody to vegf with efficacy against
colorectal and other malignancies, has already been approved
for patients (21). the effects of vegf are mediated by three
endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinases,  xxxg800xxx  ( xxxg800xxx ),
 xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx ), and  xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx ).  xxxg1274xxx  seems to
mediate the major growth and permeability actions of vegf
(22 – 25). mice engineered to lack  xxxg1274xxx  fail to develop a
vasculature and have very few endothelial cells that abnormally
coalesce into disorganized vessels (26). although targeting
 xxxg1274xxx  has been considered appropriate for blocking vegf
signaling in the vascular endothelial cells of a tumor, high daily
doses of each recent  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor are
needed for suppression of tumor growth in xenografted mice:
50 to 100 mg/kg ( xxxd3496xxx ; refs. 27 – 31), 25 to 100 mg/kg
(zd6474; refs. 32, 33), 50 mg/kg (cp-547632; ref. 34), 200
mg/kg (su6668; ref. 35), and 40 mg/kg ( xxxd3264xxx ; ref. 36).
to develop a  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with a more
potent antitumor activity, we searched and found a (3z)3-quinolin-2(1h)-ylidene-1,3-dihydro-2h-indol-2-one derivative, ym-359445, through screening based on inhibition of
 xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx . furthermore, we evaluated its antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo and compared with
other  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, including the most
recently reported high-potency compound (azd2171; ref. 37),
and an  xxxg681xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (gefitinib). in addition, we show that ym-359445 is also
effective in mice bearing cancer cells resistant to such cytotoxic
agents as paclitaxel. in this study, ym-359445 is expected to
exert a more potent effect than orally active, novel  xxxg1274xxx 
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors that have been used clinically.

o-(1,3-thiazol-4-ylmethyl)oxime mono-l-tartrate (fig. 1), and other
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors were synthesized at yamanouchi pharmaceutical co. ltd. (tsukuba, japan). paclitaxel was purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo). normal human endothelial cells [human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (huvec)] were obtained from clonetics (san
diego, ca) and cultured on gelatin-coated plates containing endothelial
growth medium-2 (egm bullet kit). six human cancer cell lines,
colo205 and hct-15 (colon cancer cells), a549 and nci-h358 (lung
cancer cells), pc-3 (prostate cancer cells), and a431 (human epidermoid
carcinoma), were obtained from american type culture collection
(rockville, md). these cancer cell lines were cultured in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (life
technologies, grand island, ny) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic
(life technologies). multidrug-resistant mcf-7/adr cells were cultured
through the stepwise increase of concentrations of adriamycin (38).
when cells were able to survive at any given concentration of drug, they
were passaged into medium with concentrations 1.5- to 2-fold higher.
the cells subsequently obtained were able to survive in 10 amol/l

containing 95% air and 5% co2.
inhibition of cell proliferation. the proliferation potency for
endothelial cells was measured with bromodeoxyuridine proliferation
assay (roche, basel, switzerland). briefly, huvecs were placed on
96-well gelatin-coated plate at the density of 1  104 per well and then
transferred into medium 199 supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine
serum. after 24 hours, the cells were dosed with ym-359445 for 2 hours
and stimulated by human recombinant vegf (10 ng/ml; r&d systems,
minneapolis, mn) for 18 hours. the cultures were pulsed with 10
amol/l bromodeoxyuridine and reincubated for 4 hours. the cells were
then fixed and measured for the bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. the
incorporated bromodeoxyuridine was detected by elisa method using
a peroxidase-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody. the elisa
was developed by 3,3v,5,5v-tetramethylbenzidene substrate, and the
absorbance was measured at 392 nm. the proliferation potency for
cancer cells was measured with the metabolic indicator alamar blue
(biosource international, camarillo, ca), which was added 48 hours
after drug treatment. the degree of proliferation was determined at 530
nm excitation and 590 nm emission.
 xxxg1274xxx  kinase domain expression and purification. the  xxxg1274xxx 
cdna-encoding amino acids 790 to 1,168 (catalytic domain) were
obtained by performing reverse transcription-pcr using total rna
isolated from huvecs.  xxxg1274xxx , nucleotide sequences encoding a flag
epitope recognized by the m2 monoclonal antibody, were incorporated
into the forward pcr primer. the cdna was then subcloned into the
pfastbac1 vector (life technologies). sf-9 cells that expressed
recombinant  xxxg1274xxx  kinase domain via use of the bac-to-bac expression
system were sonicated and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for 30 minutes at
4jc. the supernatant was then collected. the  xxxg1274xxx  kinase domain
was bound to m2-agarose (sigma) and extracted with a flag epitope.
 xxxg1274xxx  kinase assay. we used a homogeneous time-resolved
fluorescent assay format (39). the kinase reaction solution (25 al)
consisted of 100 ng  xxxg1274xxx  kinase domain in assay buffer [50 mmol/l
hepes (ph 7.5), 1 mmol/l mgcl2, 4 mmol/l mncl2, 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx ]. the kinase reaction was initiated by adding 25 al of
2 amol/l atp in a black 96-well optiplate (perkin-elmer, wellesley, ma).
after a 20-minute incubation at room temperature, 0.5 mol/l edta
(10 al) was added to terminate the reaction. fifty microliters of
homogeneous time-resolved fluorescent reagent mixture [6.5 ng cryptateconjugated anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibody (pt66, cis bio international,
saclay, france) and 100 ng xl665-conjugated flag (m2) antibody (cis
bio international) in quench buffer (50 mmol/l hepes, ph 7.5, 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0.5 mol/l kf)] was added to the reaction
mixture. the quenched reaction was incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature and then read using discovery (perkin-elmer), a timeresolved fluorescence detector.
vegf-stimulated  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation assay. huvecs were
incubated in gelatin-coated 12-well plates (1  105 per well) for
24 hours and then transferred into medium 199 supplied with 0.1% fetal
bovine serum. after 24 hours, the cells were dosed with ym-359445 for
2 hours and stimulated with human recombinant vegf (50 ng/ml) for 5
minutes. cells were lysed in tne buffer containing 10 mmol/l tris-hcl

vessel sprout formation assay. the angiogenesis kit (kurabo, osaka,
japan) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly,
the plate in which cells were already seeded and the medium for culture
were contained in the kit. vegf (10 ng/ml) was added in the medium
to induce angiogenesis more strongly. the medium was replaced every
2 or 3 days. the test condition was medium control,  xxxd328xxx 
antibody (25 ag/ml; sigma), or ym-359445 at a concentration of 0.003
amol/l. on day 13, the plates were fixed and stained with anti- xxxg1724xxx 
antibody and goat anti-mouse igg alkaline phosphatase conjugate/5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium.
determination of plasma concentrations after oral dosing in mice.
because our aim was to develop a compound that would inhibit vegfinduced angiogenesis after oral administration, we investigated whether
ym-359445 would be absorbed after oral administration in male icr
mice (japan slc, shizuoka, japan). plasma concentrations of ym359445 were also measured after a single oral administration of 1 mg/
kg. at the allotted times, three mice were sacrificed from each treatment
group, and heart blood was collected into heparinized tubes. plasma
samples were deproteinated by adding 5 volumes of acetonitrile, and
the supernatant was analyzed for ym-359445 content using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. a standard curve was
constructed from plasma added to known concentrations of the
compound and processed and analyzed as described above. concentrations down to 0.1 amol/l (the lowest concentration in the standard
curve) could be determined. pharmacokinetic variables were determined using winnonlin software.
in vivo vegf-induced microvascular permeability models. male icr
mice were treated with either 0.5 mg/kg ym-359445 or 0.5%
 xxxd2609xxx  as the vehicle control, delivered orally, and injected
with 200 al of 0.5% evans blue solution into the tail vein. thirty
minutes later, in the ether-anesthetized mice, recombinant murine
vegf (30 ng/10 al) was s.c. injected into the middle of one ear, and
pbs was injected into the other ear. thirty minutes after that, the ears
were soaked in formamide for 2 days. the volume of evans blue
extracted was then quantified using an absolution detector set at
605 nm. the percent inhibition was calculated as follows: [1  (p v  p p)
of treated group / (p v  p p) of control group]  100, where p v is
the value at the site injected with vegf and p p is the value at the site
injected with pbs.
in vivo tumor xenograft models. male nude mice were purchased
from charles river japan, inc. (kanagawa, japan). female nude mice
were used for mcf-7/adr cells only. a single-cell suspension of each
tumor cell line (2  106-5  106 cells) was inoculated into the flank
of the nude mice by s.c. injection. when the tumors reached volumes
of 50 to 150 mm3, the mice were randomized into treatment groups
(n = 5-6 per group); then, either  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor or its vehicle
(0.5%  xxxd2609xxx ) was given p.o. daily for >2 weeks. either
paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) or its vehicle (5% clemofole and 5% ethanol)
was injected i.v. into the tail vein five times weekly for 2 weeks. tumor
size and body weight were measured twice weekly. the tumor volume
was calculated using the following formula: 1 / 2  (length)  (width)2.
the percent inhibition of tumor growth was calculated as follows:
[1  (v x  v i) of treated group / (v x  v i) of control group]  100, where
v x is the tumor volume on day x and v i is the initial tumor volume. when
the value was >100%, the percent tumor regression was also calculated
as follows: (1  v x of treated group / v i of treated group)  100.
histologic analysis of colo205 tumors. each tumor was fixed in 10%
buffered formalin for 24 hours before being preserved in paraffin wax.
sections were produced by standard histologic techniques. to visualize
endothelial cells,  xxxg1724xxx  was detected using an avidin-biotin method.
briefly, sections were incubated for 1 hour with monoclonal rat
anti-mouse  xxxg1724xxx  primary antibody (1:500 dilution) followed by a
30-minute incubation with mouse-adsorbed biotinylated rabbit anti-rat
immunoglobulin (1:200 dilution) and a further 30-minute incubation

with streptabcomplex conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. up to
four randomly selected fields of view were counted for each section at
the 10 objective lens magnification level to determinate the cd31positive area per 35 mm2.
statistical treatment. data are expressed as mean f se. the
significance of differences between the two groups was determined
using the unpaired student’s t test, and the comparison of more than
two groups was determined using dunnett’s multiple range test. ps were
calculated, and differences of p < 0.05 versus control were considered
statistically significant.

assay was 0.001 amol/l, which was also the concentration that
inhibited mapk phosphorylation (fig. 2b). mapk has been
reported to be downstream of vegf (40). ym-359445 also
inhibited  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation without decreasing
total amount of  xxxg1274xxx  at a concentration of 0.03 amol/l
(fig. 2c).

huvec proliferation (ic50, 0.0015 amol/l) at concentrations
comparable with those observed in the inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx 
autophosphorylation (fig. 2b). the ic50s for the proliferation
of other various cancer cells caused by stimulation with fetal

cancer therapy: preclinical

when 1 mg/kg was given orally. a peak concentration of
f0.016 amol/l was reached at 2 hours after oral administration. the effective plasma concentration for endothelial
cells, huvec, was attained at f24 hours after administration
(fig. 4). these concentrations did not reach up to the ic50s of
cancer cell proliferation, such as colo205, shown in table 2.
oral administration of ym-359445 produced good overall
systemic exposure with a bioavailability of 23%. when 1 mg/kg
was given i.v., total body clearance was 2,506 ml/h/kg, which
was approximately half of the hepatic blood flow (5,000 ml/h/
kg). plasma elimination half-life was 4.9 hours.
effect of ym-359445 on vegf-induced vascular permeability
in vivo. vegf-induced vascular permeability in the ears of
mice was assessed by injecting evans blue solution into the tail.
the extravasation of evans blue at the site injected with vegf
was significantly greater than the site injected with pbs. ym359445 showed a complete inhibition of vascular permeability
induced by vegf at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg (fig. 5).
effect of ym-359445 on antitumor activity in in vivo xenograft
models. even when endothelial cells were treated with ym359445 at a concentration of 0.0003 amol/l for 2 hours and
then incubated in ym-359445-free medium for 24 hours,
vegf-stimulated  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation was still completely suppressed (data not shown). therefore, it was expected
that once daily repeated administration in vivo would be
sufficient. in a preliminary study, ym-359445 caused body
weight to decrease when given to normal mice at a rate of
no less than 8 mg/kg for 14 days. all mice died at the dose of
64 mg/kg, several mice died at the dose of 32 mg/kg, and no
mice died at the dose of 16 mg/kg. therefore, it was determined
that the maximum tolerated dose value of ym-359445 is 16
mg/kg. in contrast, ym-359445 did not cause significant
myelosuppression, nor did it change the weight of the liver,
spleen, or kidney at doses of up to 4 mg/kg. for this reason, we
evaluated antitumor activity using tumor-xenografted mice
with administration of up to 4 mg/kg. in the human colon
cancer colo205 xenograft model, treatment with 0.5, 1, 2, and
4 mg/kg ym-359445 for 14 days resulted in 57%, 80%, 98%,

ym-359445: a  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

ym-359445 did not cause body weight to decrease (data not
shown). vascular endothelial cells in the tumors were found
to have dose-dependently decreased the day after the final
administration of ym-359445 (fig. 7). furthermore, in the
human lung cancer a549 xenograft model, treatment with
2 and 4 mg/kg ym-359445 for 14 days resulted in tumor
growth inhibition of >100% (tumor regression of 61% and
73%, respectively). both the clinically approved epidermal
growth factor receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor gefitinib and
the cytotoxic agent paclitaxel were significantly weaker than
ym-359445 (fig. 6b). the multidrug-resistant human colon
cancer hct-15 cell line that expresses mdr-1 (42) was
observed to be preliminarily resistant to paclitaxel in its
xenograft model. therefore, in this study, the antitumor
activity of ym-359445 and paclitaxel in the xenograft model
was examined for 14 days. whereas treatment with 20 mg/kg
paclitaxel did not significantly inhibit tumor growth, treatment with 2 mg/kg ym-359445 resulted in a remarkable
inhibition of tumor growth (97%; fig. 8a and b). these
results, together with the antitumor activity of ym-359445,
other  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, paclitaxel, and
gefitinib in other human various cancer xenograft models,
are summarized in table 3. prolonged oral dosing of ym359445 produced a significant and dose-dependent inhibition
of tumor xenograft growth in all models. the efficacy of ym359445 was more potent than any other compound,
especially azd2171, the most recently reported high-potency
 xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (37). at doses of 1, 2, and 4
mg/kg in colo205 xenografted mice, ym-359445 tended to
suppress tumor growth to a greater degree.

patients. recently, a novel chemotherapy method, involving the
suppression of tumor growth or metastasis by targeting not
cancer cells but vascular endothelial cells, has been explored.
antiangiogenesis agents would be expected to be effective in
solid tumors that acquire resistance to cytotoxic agents. recently,
the usefulness of vegf signaling blockage has attracted attention
in the clinical field because vegf signaling is an important part
of vascular endothelial cell proliferation. several orally active
and low molecular compounds that use  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
inhibition as their mechanism of action are being aggressively
developed as remedies for cancer (43 – 47).
ym-359445 is obtained by the structural modification of a
basic compound that was found by randomly screening
available compounds for the purpose of finding a novel
 xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor. no (3z)-3-quinolin-2(1h)ylidene-1,3-dihydro-2h-indol-2-one derivatives have been
found that have a highly potent effect both in vitro and
in vivo. in an enzyme assay for  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  activity,
ym-359445 had an ic50 of 0.0085 amol/l, which was
extremely potent compared with other  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx

cancer therapy: preclinical

inhibitors. ym-359445 is not a nonspecific kinase inhibitor,
because the ic50s of  xxxg1836xxx , protein kinase c-a,
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1, and c-jun nh2-terminal kinase-3
were >1 amol/l (data not shown). at a concentration of 0.03
amol/l, ym-359445 inhibited  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  activity
completely. in a cell culture system, the ic50 of ym-359445
against huvec proliferation induced by vegf was 0.0015
amol/l, which was a remarkably selective and potent inhibitory
effect compared with its efficacy against other various types
of cancer cells. in addition, ym-359445 inhibited vegfstimulated autophosphorylation of  xxxg1274xxx  at a concentration
of 0.0001 amol/l. ym-359445 also inhibited sprout formation
of endothelial cells at a concentration of 0.003 amol/l, which
indicates high cell permeability. in this pharmacokinetic
study of p.o. single dosing at 1 mg/kg ym-359445 in mice,
the bioavailability was 23%, and the maximum plasma

concentration of the unchanged form of ym-359445 was
0.016 amol/l, which indicated that the adme values were also
satisfactory. in addition, because ym-359445 inhibited vegfstimulated permeability after administration of a low dose to
mice, investigation into the usefulness of the compound for the
retention of both pleural effusion and ascites might be
interesting.
ym-359445 also showed extremely potent antitumor activity
in various human cancer xenografts. ym-359445 was effective
in human colon cancer colo205 xenografts without decreasing
the body weight at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg. most
recently, a highly potent azd2171 that inhibits tumor growth
at low doses of 0.75 to 6 mg/kg has been reported (37), but
ym-359445 would be more potent. although two other
 xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors ( xxxd3264xxx  and zd6474)
dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth, the potencies were
much weaker than ym-359445. when evaluating human lung

ym-359445: a  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

cancer a549 xenografts, we compared a typical cytotoxic drug
(paclitaxel) and an existing molecular targeting drug (gefitinib,
an  xxxg681xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor)
and found that ym-359445 showed the most potent antitumor
efficacy, which included tumor regression. moreover, ym359445 showed antitumor efficacy against mice bearing human
colon cancer hct-15 cells resistant to paclitaxel. it has been
acknowledged that hct-15 cells express p-glycoprotein, a
transmembrane efflux pump that uses two atp molecules to
transport one drug molecule. its overproduction in cancer cells
is highly correlated with the development of the multidrugresistant phenotype. these antitumor characteristics of ym359445 would be caused by an antiproliferation effect on
vascular endothelial cells rather than a direct cytotoxic effect on
cancer cells. this is evident because ym-359445 selectively
inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and
because the degree of vascularity in the tumor decreased after
treatment with ym-359445 in vivo.
this study suggests that ym-359445 would be a novel, orally
available antiangiogenesis agent that suppresses the proliferation of endothelial cells and inhibits  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx .
because angiogenesis is a phenomenon observed in many kinds
of tumors, it is expected that ym-359445 would also be effective
in multidrug-resistant cancer patients and have a more potent
antitumor effect than other existing  xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors. in addition, it has already been noted that ym-

359445 inhibits tyrosine kinases other than  xxxg1274xxx , such
as  xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg802xxx , platelet-derived growth factor receptor-h,
 xxxg525xxx , and c-kit. the percent inhibition of each  xxxg2198xxx 
seen at the ym-359445 concentration of 0.001 amol/l was 66%,
73%, 84%, 25%, 71%, and 78%, respectively. the antiflt-1 antibody mf-1 also resulted in extensive tumor necrosis
(48). the activation of  xxxg801xxx  through different types of mutations
plays an important role in proliferation, resistance to apoptosis,
and prevention of the differentiation of leukemic blasts in acute
myeloid leukemia (49). in a mouse model of prostate cancer
bone metastasis, the expression of platelet-derived growth factor
receptor-h was observed on the endothelial cells of tumors
growing in the bone but not on the endothelial cells of normal
bone or of tumors growing in the surrounding muscle (50).
overexpression of  xxxg525xxx  in normal ovarian granulosa cells leads
to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (51). specific mutations
in c-kit that allow ligand-independent activation have been
detected in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (52). as mentioned
above, because these tyrosine kinases would also be involved in
tumor growth, multitargeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors may be
more effective at inhibiting tumor growth than agents that target
a single angiogenic factor. it may also improve survival in
patients bearing tumors resistant to  xxxd328xxx  antibodies, such
as bevacizumab. investigations into the safety window for the
clinical stage of cancer therapy need to be conducted in the
future.
