abstract: docosahexaenoic acid (dha, 22:6n-3) is an n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acid which attenuates the development of
hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr). the effects of dha on  xxxg2014xxx  activity in hepatic microsomes and fatty acid composition were examined in young
shr. two groups of shr were fed either a dha-enriched diet
or a control diet for 6 wk. desaturase activity and fatty acid
composition were determined in hepatic microsomes following
the dietary treatments.  xxxg2014xxx  activity was decreased by 53% in dha-fed shr and was accompanied by an
increase in 16:0 and a reduction in 16:1n-7 content in hepatic
microsomes. the dha diet also increased the levels of  xxxd2318xxx  (20:5n-3) and dha. the n-6 fatty acid content was also affected in dha-fed shr as reflected by a decrease in gamma- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3n-6),  xxxd208xxx 
(20:4n-6), adrenic acid (22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid
(22:5n-6). a higher proportion of dihomo-gamma- xxxd2490xxx 
( xxxd1886xxx ) and a lower proportion of 20:4n-6 is indicative of impaired delta-5-desaturase activity. the alterations in fatty acid
composition and metabolism may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of dha previously reported.

alterations in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism may
contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension (1–4). fatty
acids are incorporated into tissues and organs and influence
cell membrane properties important to physiological functions
such as blood pressure regulation. fatty acid composition can
affect membrane fluidity, intracellular signaling, and the activity of membrane-bound receptors and enzymes (5–7).
fatty acid composition is dependent on hepatic metabolism through a sequence of desaturation and elongation steps.
one major pathway of tissue fatty acid biosynthesis begins
with desaturation of  xxxd2833xxx  (16:0) and  xxxd3244xxx 
(18:0) (8).  xxxg2014xxx  is the key enzyme necessary

for the conversion of palmitic to palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7)
and stearic to  xxxd2777xxx  (18:1n-9). delta-6 and  xxxg757xxx  enzymes are required for the metabolism of essential
 xxxd2154xxx , linoleic (18:2n-6) and alpha-linolenic (18:3n-3),
to long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . hormonal and dietary factors can affect the activity of delta-9-, delta-6-, and
delta-5-desaturases, which alters monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fatty acid composition (9,10).
risk factors linked to coronary heart disease including hypertension, diabetes, and aging have also been associated with
impaired delta-6 and  xxxg757xxx  activities (4,8,11–14).
fish oil rich in long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx , eicosapentaenoic
(epa, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (dha, 22:6n-3) acids,
reportedly offers a protective effect against coronary artery
disease by lowering blood pressure, modulating inflammatory
and thrombotic responses, and reducing plasma lipid levels
(15–20). we have recently shown that dha alone has a blood
pressure-lowering effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats
(shr), which is associated with an increase in n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
in plasma, tissues, and organs (21,22). previous studies have
demonstrated a reduction in hepatic delta-6- and delta-5-desaturase activities in shr (1,2). moreover, supplementation
with epa and dha also decreased delta-6- and delta-5-desaturase activities in shr hepatocytes and affected n-6
polyunsaturated fatty acid composition (23,24). increased
levels of 18:1n-9 in total liver lipids have been evidenced in
shr compared to wistar kyoto (wky) rats (4). it is not
known whether dietary dha influences  xxxg2014xxx 
activity in shr.
the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of
dietary dha on hepatic microsomal delta-9 desaturation of
 xxxd3244xxx  in hypertension. to investigate whether the metabolism of  xxxd2154xxx  is altered by dietary dha, hepatic microsomal fatty acid composition was also determined in shr.

ad libitum. the rats were fed one of two diets for 6 wk. the
purified fat-free basal mix diets contained a combination of
corn and soybean oils (research diets inc., new brunswick,
nj) as the fat component; however, the experimental diet also
consisted of a dha-enriched oil (dhasco®; martek biosciences corp., columbia, md). the dietary constituents included (g/kg): corn starch, 423; sucrose, 231; casein, 150; cellulose, 50; fat, 50 (control diet, corn oil/ xxxd3230xxx : 25:25;
experimental diet, corn oil/ xxxd3230xxx /dhasco: 15:15:20);
maltodextrin 10, 40; mineral mix, 23; calcium phosphate, 13;
vitamin mix, 10; calcium carbonate, 5.5; and dl-methionine,
2.3. the fatty acid composition of the control and experimental diets is shown in table 1. the diets were stored at 0°c and
provided fresh daily. at the end of the dietary treatments,
shr were anesthetized with halothane (5%) in a mixture of
oxygen and nitrous oxide. liver tissue was excised quickly
and rinsed in cold saline. the samples were placed immediately in dry ice and then stored at −70°c until analysis. all
experimental procedures were reviewed and conducted according to the guidelines of the committee on animal research at the university of california, san francisco.
desaturation assays. liver tissue (3 g) was washed in icecold 0.15 mol/l nacl, cut into thin slices, homogenized at
4°c in a potter-elvejhem homogenizer with 6 vol of 0.05
mol/l phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and 0.25 mol/l sucrose solution. all subsequent operations were performed at the same
temperature. the crude homogenate was centrifuged at
13,000 × g for 30 min in a beckman model j-21b centrifuge,
ja 20 rotor (beckman instruments, palo alto, ca); the pellet
was then discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged again
at 105,000 × g for 60 min in a beckman model l8-55 ultracentrifuge, ti 60 rotor, to obtain the microsomal pellet. the
microsomal fraction was resuspended in 0.4 ml supernatant
and 0.8 ml of 0.05 mol/l phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and 0.25
mol/l sucrose solution. all subsequent enzymatic assays
( xxxg2014xxx  activity) and composition analysis used
these microsomal membrane fractions. microsomal protein

concentrations were estimated by the method of layne (25)
with fatty acid-free crystalline bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard. the delta-9 desaturation by liver microsomes was
measured by estimation of the percentage of conversion of
14
c  xxxd3244xxx  to its corresponding product, 14c  xxxd2777xxx .
before enzyme activity measurement, [1-14c] xxxd3244xxx 
(1-14c 18:0; 50 mci/mmol, 98% pure; nen life productsfrance sa, le blanc mesnil, france) was diluted in ethanol
(prolabo, paris, france) to a specific activity of 5 mci/mmol
with the corresponding unlabeled fatty acid (sigma chemical
co, st. louis, mo). under such conditions the reaction was
linear, proportional to the time of incubation and protein concentration (26). before the incubation, the microsomes were
preincubated at 37°c for 3 min. the incubations were then
performed in duplicate (with good reproducibility in terms of
results) in open shaking flasks, at 37°c for 15 min, with 5 mg
microsomal protein in a total volume of 2.1 ml in each flask
containing 150 µmol/l phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 7.4 µmol
atp (ph 7.4), 1 µmol coa, 2.5 µmol nadph, 10 µmol
mgcl2, and 0.05 µmol (1-14c 18:0). the coenzymes and
other reagents were pure products from sigma or merck
(darmstadt, germany). the desaturation reaction was terminated by addition of 15 ml chcl3/meoh (1:1, vol/vol).
then, the incubation mixtures were saponified for 20 min at
80°c. the transesterification was performed by addition of 2
ml 14% boron trifluoride (sigma chemical co.) in methanol
and incubated at 80°c for 20 min, according to slover and
lanza (27). after addition of 2 ml 35%  xxxd3213xxx , the
fatty acid methyl esters were extracted two times with 1 ml
isooctane (carlo erba, milan, italy). the samples were kept
in 2 ml at −20°c under nitrogen. the distribution of radioactivity between substrates and products was determined by the
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography technique described by narce et al. (28) using a waters set (510
hplc pump and 410 differential refractometer; millipore,
molsheim, germany) equipped with a merck lichrocart column (superspher rp 18, 250 × 4 mm i.d.; merck). analyses
were carried out isocratically using acetonitrile/water (95:5,
vol/vol) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. the
fatty acid methyl ester mixtures were dissolved in pure acetone before injection. to collect the 14c radioactive methyl
ester fractions, the solvent obtained from the detector was recovered and the radioactivity was directly measured in the
solvent by liquid scintillation counting twice for 5 min (ultimagold; packard instrument, rungis, france) in 20 ml
zinsser polyethylene vials (frankfurt, germany) with a
packard tri-carb model 1900 tr liquid scintillation analyzer. counting efficiencies were estimated by external standardization. the fatty acid methyl esters were identified according to their retention times by comparison with “cold”
reference standards (nu-chek-prep, elysian, mn). the specific activity, expressed as pmol converted per min per mg microsomal protein, was calculated from the conversion percentage determined from the radioactivity distribution percentage of total  xxxd2154xxx . a control assay with addition of
microsomes, but also 15 ml chcl3/meoh (1:1, vol/vol),

docosahexaenoic acid and fatty acid composition

was done at time 0 of the reaction and no desaturation was
observed.
lipid analysis. fatty acid composition of total liver lipids
in microsomes was determined by gas–liquid chromatography of methyl esters. briefly, total lipids were extracted by
the method of folch et al. (29), saponified, and methylated
by the method of slover and lanza (27) at 80°c for 20 min.
fatty acid methyl esters were then extracted with 2 ml isooctane, separated by gas–liquid chromatography in a packard,
model 417 gas–liquid chromatograph equipped with a flameionization detector and a 30-m capillary glass column coated
with carbowax 20m. conditions were as follows: oven,
194°c; and injector and ionization detector, 240°c. helium
was used as the carrier gas, with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min.
quantitative analysis was achieved with reference to the internal standards (nu-chek-prep) by means of a delsi
enica 31 (delsi nermag instruments, rungis, france). the
percentage of total fatty acid was given by weight for the fatty
acids of main interest.

compared to activity in control shr.
hepatic microsomal fatty acid composition. the fatty acid
composition of hepatic microsomal total lipids is presented in

20:4n-6, 22:4n-6, and 22:5n-6 was observed in hepatic microsomes in dha-fed shr. this was accompanied with a
significant increase in  xxxd1886xxx , which is consistent with impaired delta-5-desaturase activity. the dha diet also increased levels of n-3  xxxd2154xxx , 20:5n-3 (epa) and 22:6n-3
(dha) by 8.5- and 3.3-fold, respectively. a reduction in
18:3n-3 and 22:5n-3 levels was found in dha-fed shr compared to control shr.

discussion
several experimental studies have demonstrated that alterations in tissue fatty acid metabolism are associated with hypertension (1–4). increasing evidence suggests that dietary fish
oils, epa and dha, have an antihypertensive effect (15–17).
our recent investigation shows that the attenuation of high
blood pressure in dha-fed shr (13 wk old) is associated
with profound changes in the fatty acid composition of the
vasculature, liver, and organs involved in blood pressure regulation (22). we observed an increase in hepatic levels of 18:0
and a decrease in 18:1n-9 indicative of inhibition of delta-9desaturase activity. this result is attributed to dietary dha
since a previous investigation found decreased levels of 18:0
and increased levels of 18:1n-9 in total liver lipids of 13-wkold shr compared to wky rats fed standard chow (4).
in the present study, the direct effects of dietary dha on
 xxxg2014xxx  activity and fatty acid composition was investigated in hepatic microsomes of shr. this is the first
study known to examine the influence of dietary dha on
 xxxg2014xxx  in shr. a recent investigation reported
that dha administered by gastric intubation for 10 d in normotensive rats decreased  xxxg2014xxx  mrna by 70%
(30). our results demonstrate that  xxxg2014xxx  activity
is reduced by 53% in microsomes of dha-fed shr. this
finding is supported by the fatty acid compositional changes
of 16:0 and 16:1n-7 in hepatic microsomes of dha-fed shr
even though 16:1n-7 levels are not statistically significant.
there is, however, a 30% reduction in the ratio of
16:1n-7/16:0 in the dha fed shr compared to control shr,
which is a better reflection of the depressed  xxxg2014xxx 
activity. the rise in 16:0 is significant, especially since this
fatty acid is a major constituent in hepatic microsomes as well
as total liver lipids (22). saturated  xxxd2154xxx  have several
functions in cell physiology including production and storage

of energy, lipid transport, synthesis of membrane lipids, and
modification of membrane proteins (6). in a previous study,
we have shown that total liver lipids were increased in shr
fed a standard diet, with a concomitant increase of 18:1n-9
(4). the decreased delta-9-desaturation, due to dietary dha
evidenced in the present work indicates that, in fact, such a
diet tends to modify the altered delta-9-desaturation to the
level observed in nonhypertensive rats. such a result is of interest, related to the hypotensive effect of dha. however, the
limited  xxxg2014xxx  activity was not consistent with
changes in 18:0 and 18:1n-9 in hepatic microsomes in contrast to our previous results in total liver lipids (22). this apparent discrepancy could be related to the compositional difference of microsomes and total lipids. total liver lipids also
contain storage lipids, which may modify their composition
in response to dietary changes. consequently, the more stable
membrane structural lipids in microsomes are less affected.
other enzyme systems involved in lipid metabolism such as
acyltransferase or fatty acid synthetase may maintain 18:0
and 18:1n-9 levels at the microsomal level, despite impairment of  xxxg2014xxx  activity. this could also reflect
strong membrane stability of saturated and monounsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx .
the supplementation of dha in the diet increased the proportion of dha by 3.3-fold in hepatic microsomes. this finding is comparable to our previous results in total liver lipids
of shr fed a dha-enriched diet (22). in the present study, a
marked increase was also observed in the level of epa in
dha-fed shr. since epa is not preformed or available in
the diet, the data suggests that dha is retroconverted to epa
in hepatic microsomes. this has been demonstrated in a previous study in isolated rat hepatocytes (31). the elevation in
epa content in shr may be of significance since epa is a
precursor for vasoactive eicosanoids.
dietary dha affected the composition of long-chain n-6
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  18:3n-6, 20:4n-6, 22:4n-6, and
22:5n-6 in shr. other investigators have shown that dietary
fish oil rich in both epa and dha increases the profile of
serum and hepatic microsomal n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in spraguedawley rats at the expense of n-6 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
(32). the present study shows that dha alone has an influence on the fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes in
favor of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in shr. our findings of increased levels of  xxxd1886xxx  and decreased content of 20:4n-6 are indicative of impaired delta-5-desaturase activity induced by dietary
dha. a previous investigation demonstrated that hepatic
delta-5-desaturase activity is depressed in shr aged 13 wk
fed an epa- and dha-enriched diet for 9 wk (24). we also
reported a concomitant increase in  xxxd1886xxx  and a reduction in
20:4n-6 in hepatocyte total lipids.
alterations in the fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes of dha-fed shr may influence the supply of longchain unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  to other tissues such as the kidney, which is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension.
numerous epidemiological and experimental studies have
suggested that dietary n-3  xxxd2154xxx  have a beneficial effect
lipids, vol. 35, no. 9 (2000)

on the development of kidney diseases (33,34). by giving a
supplement of purified epa, dha, or corn oil, we have
demonstrated that increasing levels of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in membranes affects the uptake and intracellular metabolism of fatty
acids as well as membrane fluidity in the kidney (35). we
have also shown that dietary dha increases n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
and reduces the levels of n-6  xxxd2154xxx  in the vasculature and
organs of shr (22). the resulting physiochemical changes in
membrane structure may modify cellular responses important
to blood pressure regulation. the n-3  xxxd2154xxx  reportedly
modulate intracellular calcium concentrations in vascular
smooth muscle in shr (36–38). this may explain why dha
elicits a vasorelaxant response in shr aorta (39). a similar
effect in systemic arteries would decrease vascular resistance
and lower blood pressure. another recent study demonstrated
that dietary dha affects the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system in shr by reducing adrenal synthesis of aldosterone
(21). the results from these studies may be related to the effects of dietary dha on desaturation and unsaturated fatty
acid composition in shr.
in conclusion, dietary dha decreases  xxxg2014xxx 
activity in hepatic microsomes in shr and tends to modify it
to the level observed in nonhypertensive rats. the dha diet
also produced increased proportions of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in hepatic microsomes at the expense of long-chain n-6  xxxd2154xxx 
in shr. it is possible that dietary dha influences cellular
membrane properties and function as a result of the fatty acid
compositional changes. these effects may be important to
blood pressure regulation in shr.
