glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive agents with complex actions on immune cells evoking
the following effects: inducing apoptosis, changing differentiation fate, inhibition of cytokine release,
inhibition of migration and other features. distinct molecular mechanisms of the  xxxg1601xxx 
(gr) contribute to different anti-inﬂammatory effects. recently inﬂammatory models have been investigated using conditional knockout and function selective mice shedding light on critical cell types and
molecular mechanisms of endogenous and therapeutic gc actions. here we review the multiple effects of
gcs on major immune cells, dendritic cells, myeloid cells and b- and t-lymphocytes and give a summary
of studies using conditional gr knockout mice.

1. introduction
glucocorticoid (gc) or steroid therapy is a common medication
throughout westernized medicine to combat allergic and chronic
inﬂammatory diseases, such as asthma, dermatitis, rheumatoid
arthritis and even some cancers. chronic treatment however,
evokes severe side effects due to the catabolic actions of glucocorticoids (gcs) in mesenchymal tissues, such as atrophy of the skin,
muscle weakness and osteoporosis. due to its metabolic actions in
the liver, in particular gluconeogenesis, gc access leads to insulin
resistance and diabetes. thus, a molecular understanding of cell
type speciﬁc effects of this pleiotropic hormone is required to
develop strategies to overcome side effects by maintaining the therapeutic efﬁcacy of steroids. here we discuss molecular mechanisms
of the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) in different cell types of the
immune system. we describe results from studies using conditional
gr knockout mice deﬁning the requirement of the gr in selective
cell types for therapy.
2. molecular mechanisms of the  xxxg1601xxx 
gcs act primarily via a nuclear receptor namely the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), a member of the nuclear receptor family. in
the absence of ligands the gr resides in the cytoplasm in complex with chaperonic molecules composed of heat shock proteins
hsp90, 70, 23 and immunophilins  xxxg799xxx ,  xxxg799xxx , cyp44 and  xxxg2267xxx 
[1] (see also fig. 1). in the cytoplasm the ligand bound gr can
interact with signaling pathways such as pi3k, jnk, 14-3-3 pro-

teins and components of the t cell receptor (tcr) signaling complex
[2] (fig. 1), and thereby modulate pro-inﬂammatory gene expression. seemingly more important and better characterized are gr
actions in the nucleus. upon ligand binding the chaperonic complex is remodeled, exposing nuclear localization sequences on the
gr, which leads to its nuclear translocation. in the nucleus the gr
regulates gene expression by two major mechanisms (fig. 1). the
ﬁrst one involves binding of a dimerized gr to palindromic glucocorticoid response elements (gre) within the promoter of genes,
the subsequent recruitment of co-activators leading to chromatin
remodeling and facilitation of transcription. although gres were
long time considered to be conserved, genome wide analysis of gr
binding revealed that base pair variations within the gre sequence
lead to different gr activities [3]. furthermore it could recently be
shown by global chip studies that the liganded and – surprisingly –
the unliganded gr can bind to highly various dna themes utilizing
different co-activator complexes in a cell type speciﬁc manner [4].
whether the latter always translate to changes of gene expression
remain to be proven by further chip sequencing approaches.
the second mode of transcriptional regulation is independent of
dimerization and dna binding by tethering of the gr monomer to
pro-inﬂammatory transcription factors, such as ap-1, nf-␬b, irf-3
stat, creb, nfat,  xxxg2252xxx  and gata-3 (reviewed in [5]). these interactions require the presence of recently identiﬁed co-integrators
for gr-mediated interference [6,7]. often this tethering results in
the inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory genes and is supposed to act
in the resolution of inﬂammation by gcs [8]. lately, synergistic
activity of the gr with members of the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar) family namely ppar␥ [9] and ppar␣ [10]
had been reported to suppress nf-␬b and irf-3 dependent target
genes via tethering mechanisms as well, opening the possibility to
increase anti-inﬂammatory efﬁcacy with gcs when co-treated with
ppar ligands. in the light that ppar␥ ligands were newly demon-

fig. 1. molecular mechanisms of gr action. glucocorticoids act on cells by crossing the cell membrane and binding to the cytoplasmatic  xxxg1601xxx  (gr). after
ligand binding the chaperonic molecules dissociate from the gr (1). the ligand bound gr exhibit cytoplasmatic activities in particular interfering with signal transducers
such as map kinases or  xxxg1743xxx  kinases, but also with components of the t cell receptor (2). this often results in suppression of these signaling events. the interaction with
pi3k can be positive or negative depending on gc concentrations. the hormone bound gr translocates very efﬁcient to the nucleus (3). as a dimer it binds as a bona ﬁde
transcription factor to dna and recruits co-activators such as  xxxg1449xxx /src and cbp leading to chromatin remodeling and facilitated gene transcription (4). some of the gene
products regulated by the gr exert anti-inﬂammatory activities such as the phosphatase dusp-1. enhanced dusp-1 expression upon gc exposure leads to inhibition of
p38 mapk and jnk (5). the gr monomer also interacts by a tethering mechanism with co-integrators such as trip6 and stamp at sites of pro-inﬂammatory dna bound
transcription factors (6). co-activators such as grip-1 may be also sequestered from these complexes by the gr. by these mechanisms the activities of ap-1, nf-␬b and irf-3
are modulated or even repressed (6). recently, the cooperative action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) with the gr in suppression of pro-inﬂammatory
transcription factors had been demonstrated.

strated to bind to the gr as partial agonists [11], it is more than
worthy to look further into this therapeutic possibility. general
it is believed that targeting the tethering mechanism of the gr
exclusively by selective gr agonists (segras) allows to maintain
immunosuppressive properties of gr ligands. side effects dependent on gr dna binding however would be omitted by these
compounds [12]. indeed cells and mice carrying a mutated gr
with a point mutation abrogating the dimerization interface of the
gr in the dbd (grdim ) still possess efﬁcient suppression of nf-␬b
and ap-1 while the induction of gre dependent gluconeogenetic
genes in the liver or transfected mouse mammary tumor virus ltrs
is absent [13–15]. initial studies with grdim mice also revealed
potent anti-inﬂammatory activities of gcs in irritated skin models, indicating that the tethering mechanism is sufﬁcient for this
process [15]. however the extension of analyses of grdim mice in
other inﬂammatory diseases [16] reveals a requirement of dimerization dependent activity of the gr for anti-inﬂammation. this
is in agreement with the ﬁnding, that some of the identiﬁed segras are potent in some inﬂammatory assays in vivo and in part
show reduced side effects [17,18], whereas others fail to reduce side
effects in vivo (reviewed in [19]). in particular, the induction of gre
dependent genes such as  xxxg664xxx / xxxg664xxx  can contribute substantially to anti-inﬂammatory activities of the gr [20].  xxxg664xxx  induced
by the liganded gr is a phosphatase, dephosphorylating jnk and
mapk p38, which leads to suppression of pro-inﬂammatory gene
expression and an anti-inﬂammatory response in some [21,22], but
not all animal models [23].
different gr mechanisms in different cell types might be therefore required for full anti-inﬂammatory activities of gcs. below

we summarize brieﬂy what has been described for gc effects on
selected immune cell types.
3. cell type speciﬁc actions of the gr
3.1. dendritic cells
dendritic cells (dcs) are considered as the professional antigen
presenting cells, which take up antigen and mature by processing
the antigen. once mature they migrate to draining lymph nodes
and potently induce antigen speciﬁc t helper cells. glucocorticoids
inﬂuence dcs on virtual all levels of their life cycle (fig. 2). before
they mature after encountering antigen, gcs are potent inducers
of dc apoptosis, but not of apoptosis in monocytes, from which
they differentiate [24]. strong activation of dcs by cd40 ligands can
counteract this caspase independent apoptosis [25]. gcs stimulate
antigen uptake [26,27] and dc activation is potently suppressed
by gcs, i.e. by reduction of mhcii, of co-stimulatory molecules,
and of cytokine expression [28,29]. also migration towards the
lymph nodes in general is inhibited, as shown by in vivo [16,30]
and in vitro studies presumably due to down regulation of ccr7
expression [31]. however, in an asthma model gc treatment in
vivo did not affect dc maturation during the sensitization phase
[32].
gcs do not simply suppress dc activity they also seem to
induce a tolerogenic dc phenotype by suppression of dc activation markers and concomitant up regulation of phagocytic activity
and enhanced il-10 expression [27,33]. tolerogenic dcs induce
t cell anergy, suppression of t cells and generate regulatory t

fig. 2. multiple effects of the gr on major immune cells. gcs inﬂuence neutrophil functions by suppressing rolling, adhesion and transmigration by reducing the expression of
adhesion molecules like integrins, selectins (e-sel., l-sel.) and intercellular adhesion molecules (icams) in neutrophils and endothelial cells. gcs efﬁciently suppress classical
macrophage activation by induction of il-10, an immunomodulatory cytokine and by the inhibition of the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines like tnf␣, ifn␥ or il-1␤.
cytokines are suppressed by mechanisms requiring the dimerized gr (by activating gre dependent genes like dusp-1) as well as tethering mechanisms, i.e. interfering with
nf-␬b, ap-1 and irf-3. gcs inﬂuence dendritic cells (dcs) on all levels of their life cycle. they facilitate antigen uptake of immature dcs but suppress their maturation by
reduction of mhcii, co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine expression. furthermore they potently induce apoptosis of dcs and reduce their migratory capacity. chronic gc
treatment leads to a reduction of splenic and lymph node b cell numbers, reduction of igg production but enhanced ige generation. t helper cell differentiation and function
is affected by gcs through repression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and by regulation of transcription factors (for details see fig. 3).

cells. thereby they protect from autoimmunity or graft versus host
response [33]. gcs were found to be among the most potent inducers of tolerogenic dcs [34]. inducing tolerance reveals therefore a
powerful mechanism of anti-inﬂammatory action of gcs.
3.2. macrophage
macrophages derive from monocytes and play a central role
in innate immunity and at the initiation of adaptive immunity.
their activation by microbial pattern recognition receptors (e.g.
toll-like receptors, tlrs) and their large repertoire to release
inﬂammatory regulators make these cells a prominent relevant
target for anti-inﬂammatory therapy by steroids. indeed a number of cytokines is efﬁciently suppressed by gcs by mechanisms
requiring both gr dimerization and tethering mechanisms [15,16]
(fig. 2). extensive expression proﬁling of murine macrophages
revealed mainly tethering mechanisms with p65/nf-␬b and irf3 for repressed genes [9]. for suppression of irf-3 activity a
sequestering mechanism by competing of gr with irf-3 and
with the co-activator/co-repressor grip-1 had been proposed [35].
however, recently an alternative anti-inﬂammatory phenotype of
human monocyte derived macrophages was observed upon exposure to gcs. these immunosuppressive properties are exempliﬁed
in a gene expression proﬁle with enhanced phagocytotic activity by up regulation of the scavenger receptor  xxxg374xxx  [36] and
induced expression of the immunomodulatory cytokine il-10. this
anti-inﬂammatory phenotype was also detected in murine cells
accompanied with elevated  xxxg374xxx  and gr-1 expression and down
regulation of the cx3cr1  xxxg565xxx , a hallmark of inﬂammatory monocytes [37]. interestingly, these cells display a high
migratory capacity and a similar phenotype like functional myeloid
suppressor cells, which share a similar surface expression. how stable this phenotype is in vivo under chronic gc treatment remains to
be proven and would give some promise for anti-tumorigenic gc
therapy. this phenotype could contribute to the anti-inﬂammatory

activity by increasing non-phlogistic phagocytosis of apoptotic
neutrophils [38,39].
3.3. neutrophil granulocytes
neutrophils or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are
present in the blood stream and comprise the major inﬁltrating
cell type in acute inﬂammation. their attraction by chemokines
released by mast cells, endothelial cells and other myeloid cells
and their inﬁltration involves a series of events which are modulated by gcs [40]. rolling, adhesion, activation, and transmigration
through the blood vessel are steps to invade the tissue. gcs suppress adhesion via reducing l-selectin expression in pmns and eand  xxxg2049xxx  in endothelial cells. rolling and ﬁrm adhesion is
performed by the interaction of the leukocyte integrins ␤2 (vla4) and ␤2 (lfa-1 and mac-1) with the endothelial counterparts
vca-1, icam-1, icam-2 and  xxxg1128xxx , which are all reduced in the
presence of gcs [40–42] (see fig. 2). in contrast to the suppression of extravasation of pmns, gcs increase bone marrow-derived
neutrophils in the blood stream. this function is utilized clinically
to combat neutropenia usually in combination with g-csf [43].
however, the molecular mechanism for this phenomenon is not
resolved yet. intriguingly gcs delay granulocyte apoptosis and shift
them to a necrosis during acute inﬂammation which has poorly
understood consequences on the resolution of inﬂammation under
gc treatment [38].
3.4. b cells
despite the long term use of gcs also in b cell dependent
pathologies, the actions of gcs on b cells are not intensively investigated. the predominant observations of gc treatment on b cell are
basically a reduction of splenic and lymph node b cell numbers at
chronic gc treatment, an attenuation of early b cell progenitor proliferation and enhanced ige, but suppressed igg production [44,45]

fig. 3. complex role of the gr in t cells. gc actions on t helper cells affect thymocyte maturation and th cell differentiation. dp thymocytes are very sensitive towards
gc-induced apoptosis, whereas sps are less sensitive due to enhanced cd28 expression (left). at physiological doses gcs can cause a shift from th1 response towards th2
immunity (left below). pharmacological doses exert anti-inﬂammatory effects on the different t helper cell populations by repression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and by
regulation of transcription factors (right). ror␥t expression is reduced by gcs in th17 cells by an unknown mechanism. treg numbers are increased by il-10 released from
tolerogenic myeloid cells. whether foxp3 is regulated by gcs is not known. in th1 cells  xxxg2215xxx  and  xxxg2252xxx  activity is inhibited by the activated gr through direct protein–protein
interactions. in th2 cells the gr prevents the nuclear import of gata-3 and suppresses  xxxg2217xxx  function.

(fig. 2). thus gcs could be involved in an enhanced th2 response.
the paucity of animal models with a speciﬁc deletion of the gr in b
cell lineage prevents a greater insight in gc actions on b cells. once
these animals are generated the relevance of actions of gcs on b
cells in complex diseases will be unveiled.
3.5. t cells
in contrast to gc action on b cells a lot of attention has been
drawn to t cells. t cells are the main players in the adaptive immune
system. the development occurs in the thymus where the cells
mature from a double negative (dn: cd4−cd8−) stage via a double
positive stage (dp: cd4+cd8+) to the ﬁnal stage of maturation, the
single positive stage (sp: cd4+ or cd8+). at the double positive (dp)
stage, positive and negative selection occurs. the positive selection
process is mainly determined by a strong t cell receptor (tcr) signaling triggered apoptosis. negative selection occurs in the virtual
absence of tcr signaling also leading to apoptosis. interestingly, dp
t cells are very sensitive towards gc-induced apoptosis (reviewed
in [46]) (fig. 3). gc-induced apoptosis requires the dimerization of
the gr [14] and is mediated via the bh3 only pro-apoptotic proteins
puma and bim [47,48].
in vitro studies showed that tcr signaling can antagonize gcinduced apoptosis and vice versa, gc treatment alleviated tcr
triggered apoptosis. furthermore it was observed that thymic
endothelial cells produce gcs locally [49,50]. a ‘mutual antagonism’ model had therefore been suggested for thymocyte selection
[51,52]. thymocytes expressing tcrs with high avidity for selfpeptides/mhc undergo apoptosis due to the strong tcr signal that
cannot be overruled by the gr signal. thymocytes with suboptimal
tcr signaling would receive the unopposed gr signal resulting in
gc-induced apoptosis. finally in thymocytes expressing a tcr with
a low or moderate tcr avidity for self-peptide, the tcr and gr

signal neutralize each other leading to cell survival and differentiation. however, the in vivo evidence of endogenous gc action on
thymocyte selection is controversial. in studies with mice expressing an antisense gr which reduced endogenous gr expression, the
thymus indeed led to a diminished repertoire of tcrs, thereby supporting this model [52,53]. in contrast, mice with t cells entirely
lacking gr by targeted gene deletion do not change their tcr repertoire at all [54], although they are resistant to gc-induced apoptosis
induced either directly by gc administration or by triggering the
hpa axis by systemic inﬂammation [54,55]. thus, if and how gcinduced apoptosis plays a role in the selection process in thymus
remains to be further explored.
in contrast to the ﬁndings in thymocytes, in vivo evidence from
gr knockout/knockin mice is present for antagonism of tcr mediated cell death in the peripheral t cells by the gr. using t cell
speciﬁc deletion of the gr (grlckcre ) and grdim mice, it could
be demonstrated that activation induced cell death (aicd), which
reduces the t cell response after infection, is modulated by gcs. this
is achieved via suppressing  xxxg764xxx  death protein expression through
binding of the dimerized gr to a ngre binding site [56].
the molecular mechanism of the mutual interference of tcr
signaling and gr activity is being to be revealed. recently, it
was shown for peripheral t cells that short-term treatment with
gcs cause the disruption of the tcr multi-protein complex and
impaired tcr signaling via a non-genomic action of gr [57,58].
in murine and human t cells, gr is part of the multi-protein tcr
complex containing the theta tcr chain,  xxxg2438xxx  kinase, heat shock
protein 90 (hsp90), lck and fyn kinases [57,58]. gc treatment
induced dissociation of this protein complex which results in abrogated lck/fyn activities and reduced tcr signaling. interestingly,
based on knock down experiments löwenberg et al. claim a requirement of the unliganded gr for normal tcr signaling [59]. this
provocative assumption is challenged by an efﬁcient tcr signal-

u. baschant, j. tuckermann / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 120 (2010) 69–75

ing in t-lymphocytes in the absence of the gr [56,60]. however, a
compensatory mechanism in gr knockout mice replacing the gr in
the tcr complex cannot be excluded. thus, a temporal conditional
deletion of the gr in vivo could ﬁnally answer this discrepancy.
interestingly, mature sp thymocytes and peripheral t cells are
less sensitive towards gc-induced apoptosis and display a delayed
kinetic of cell death. reichardt and co-workers propose that in contrast to immature dp thymocytes increased cd28 signaling in sp
thymocytes and peripheral t cells counteracts the rapid apoptotic
response to gcs [61].
differentiated peripheral cd4+ t helper cells are central regulators of the adaptive immune response and participate also in innate
immune responses. upon stimulation with antigen during infection
or inﬂammation, naïve th cells differentiate into different lineages
of th cells: th1, th2, th17 or tregs, each of them with distinct functions. th1 cells that express the lineage speciﬁc transcription factor
 xxxg2252xxx  and activated  xxxg2215xxx  mainly release the pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines ifn␥, il-2 and tnf␣ [62]. their activity facilitates the
activation of effector t cells, nk cells and macrophages. th2 cells
express selectively the transcription factors gata3 and are characterized by the expression of  xxxg1180xxx , il-4, il-10 and il-13 [63]. th2
cells stimulate mainly b cells to produce antibodies and activate
eosinophils and mast cells in allergic responses.  xxxg1166xxx  producing
th17 cells depend on stat3 mediated induction of the nuclear
orphan receptors ror␥t and ror␣ [64–66]. th17 cells play an
important role in autoimmune diseases and in host defense against
infection. regulatory t cells depend in their fate on the transcription factor foxp3 and counteract th1 and th2 cell responses and
suppress a variety of pathogenic autoimmune syndromes [67].
gcs inhibit the transcription of many t cell derived cytokines
(fig. 2) and can cause a shift from th1 to th2 immunity at physiological doses [68] (fig. 3). at pharmacological doses gcs are able
to reduce the synthesis and release of th1 cytokines like il-2 and
ifn␥ and reduce  xxxg2215xxx  activity [69] and th2 cytokines like il-4 and
 xxxg1180xxx  [70] (fig. 3). furthermore pharmacological doses suppress the
activity of th1 lineage specifying transcription factor  xxxg2252xxx  by direct
protein–protein interactions. the interaction results in diminished
binding of  xxxg2252xxx  to dna. [71]. also the activity of the th2 deﬁning
transcription factor gata-3 is suppressed by the gr. this occurs
via two mechanisms: ﬁrst by competition of gata-3 and the gr
for importin and second by preventing phosphorylation of gata-3
by gc-induced  xxxg664xxx / xxxg664xxx  expression. [72]. furthermore  xxxg2217xxx 
activity, involved in th2 lineage speciﬁcation is affected by the gr
presumably by protein–protein interaction [73].
how gcs act on  xxxg1166xxx  producing t cells has not been extensively
studied so far. in ra patients it was found that gc therapy attenuated  xxxg1166xxx  levels [74] and also in asthma patients treated orally
with steroids a decrease in  xxxg1166xxx  production could be observed.
animal and in vitro studies concerning the role of gcs in th17 cells
are however controversial (fig. 3). in rat lymphocytes methylprednisolone inhibited antigen-induced  xxxg1166xxx  expression probably due
to reduced ror␥t expression or diminished il-6 release by nont cells [75]. in contrast mckinley and colleagues show that th17
cell cytokine production is not sensitive to dexamethasone treatment and in a th17 mediated airway inﬂammation mouse model
glucocorticoids did not attenuate cytokine responses [76].
whether the modulation of th17 by gcs is required for the
suppression of allergic or autoimmune diseases is not entirely
understood and requires speciﬁc conditional mouse models, especially to prove eventual functional correlations between the
anti-inﬂammatory features of gcs and th17 cells.
in contrast to pro-inﬂammatory acting t cells it was reported
that cd4+cd25+ treg cell populations are enhanced upon dexamethasone treatment in vitro and in mice by being more resistant to
gc-induced apoptosis [77,78] (fig. 3). tregs primed by gcs in vitro
were indeed capable to reduce eae (experimental autoimmune

73

encephalomyelitis) in mice [79]. however, we found that endogenous tregs in an eae model are suppressed to a similar extent like
other th subsets in gc therapy of eae [80].
overall, to address the speciﬁc requirement of gcs in th subsets in steroid therapy, targeted deletion of the gr in those cell
populations is required. those mice will be generated soon, since
respective cre transgenic mouse lines are now available.
4. critical cells types and mechanisms of the gr for
anti-inﬂammatory gc action
the generation of conditional gr mutant mice in the recent
years enabled the ﬁnding of critical cell types required for antiinﬂammatory gc action. in addition knockin mice such as the grdim
mice allow determining the contribution of dimerization dependent gr action towards steroid therapy in inﬂammatory diseases.
4.1. inﬂammatory skin diseases
a widely used model for irritant and unspeciﬁc skin inﬂammation is phorbol-ester (pma)-induced edema formation. the skin
irritation is characterized by swelling associated with massive and
rapid inﬂux of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. gc treatment
leads to inhibition of the inﬂammatory response. in this model
for the anti-inﬂammatory effect the dimerization of the gr is not
required. grdim mice, a total knockin mouse that lack the dimerization function of the gr, show an efﬁcient reduction of the
pma-induced skin irritation [15].
contact hypersensitivity (chs), a rodent model for contact dermatitis, is in contrast to the pma-induced skin irritation, a t cell
dependent immune response. in chs however, binding of the gr
to the dna and an efﬁcient suppression of il-1␤ and chemokines,
but not of tnf␣ is required for the anti-inﬂammatory effect [16].
using tissue speciﬁc gr knockout mice, it turned out that the primary targets of gc therapy in chs are myeloid cells. grlysmcre mice,
lacking the gr in macrophages and neutrophils, were refractory to
gc therapy. in t cells and in keratinocytes gc action is dispensable
since grlckcre mice, lacking the gr in t cells and grk14cre mice,
lacking the gr in keratinocytes, show perfect anti-inﬂammatory
response to gc treatment [16].
4.2. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae)
multiple sclerosis (ms), an autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system, is mainly treated with a high-dose gc therapy. a
commonly used rodent model of ms is the eae model. the animals
are immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog),
which leads to a chronic fulminant inﬂammation, demyelinating
lesions and subsequent axonal damage. using different gr deﬁcient
mutant mice, we could show that gcs mainly act on peripheral t
cells and not on cns residing t cells or macrophages via induction of apoptosis and suppression of adhesion molecules [80]. the
therapeutic effect of gc treatment is accompanied by induction of
apoptosis and down-regulation of adhesion molecules in peripheral th17 and bystander t cells. furthermore, dexamethasone did
block the migration of t cells to the cns. in contrast to contact
allergy, t cells are critical for gc therapy in this autoimmune disease.
4.3. septic shock
a systemic strong inﬂammatory response that requires the
action of endogenous gcs is septic shock. sepsis is a complex deregulation of inﬂammation arising when the host is unable to defeat
an infection successfully. subsequently a fulminant inﬂammatory
response leads to organ damage and ﬁnally to death. septic shock

74

u. baschant, j. tuckermann / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 120 (2010) 69–75

in rodents can be induced by bolus injection of  xxxg2290xxx  (tlr4) agonists, e.g. lipopolysaccharides (lps). endogenous
gcs are required for survival of septic shock, since adrenalectomized rodents have impaired survival [81]. patients with severe
sepsis often have the additional complication of adrenal insufﬁciency. conditional gr knockout mice lacking the gr in myeloid
cells exhibit a similar lethality, suggesting that in myeloid cells
gr is required to limit endotoxic shock [22]. here, a defect in
gr-mediated inhibition of p38 mapk by an absence of  xxxg664xxx  expression was shown to be the underlying mechanism. this
view is challenged by the fact that gr dimerization deﬁcient
macrophages that were activated by lps and concomitantly treated
with dexamethasone exhibit a similar induction of dusp-1/ xxxg664xxx 
[21], although grdim animals display a strong impairment of gc
action in septic shock (kleyman and tuckermann, unpublished).
thus, multiple mechanisms lead to a general suppression of
cytokine expression and activation of macrophages in septic shock.
open questions are which monocyte subsets might be speciﬁcally
involved in the protection of septic shock by gcs—and whether
an anti-inﬂammatory phenotype as described for in vitro treated
monocytes/macrophages [36,37] occur in that process.

4.4. perspective
so far only a few examples of inﬂammatory diseases have
been analyzed with conditional gr knockout mice, in particular
skin inﬂammation, septic shock and experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (eae). important common allergic and chronic
inﬂammatory diseases, where gcs are the mainstay of therapy,
have not been exploited in mutant animals, yet. for instance,
rheumatoid arthritis has been treated with gcs for 60 years, despite
the development of new drugs. in this disease numerous cell types,
immune cells and also non-hematopoietic mesenchymal cells are
important. the speciﬁc cell types that respond to gcs to ensure
successful therapy remain to be identiﬁed. deletion of the gr in t
cells, b cells, dendritic cells and in ﬁbroblasts or osteoblasts in mice
will achieve this goal. the identiﬁcation of such cell types will give
the rationale for deﬁning speciﬁc steroids that are active only in
particular tissues – so-called soft steroids – whose development is
just at the beginning [82]. finally novel gr knockin mice addressing
the function of this receptor in the cytoplasm, or speciﬁc interference with other signaling pathways will help to clarify molecular
mechanisms of steroid therapy in vivo.
