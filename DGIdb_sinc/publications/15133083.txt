the uptake, biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines in the microsporidian parasite
encephalitozoon cuniculi are detailed with reference to the effects of oligoamine and arylamine
analogues of polyamines. enc. cuniculi, an intracellular parasite of mammalian cells, has both
biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of polyamine metabolism, as demonstrated in cell-free extracts
of mature spores. the uptake of polyamines was measured in immature, pre-emergent spores
isolated from host cells by percoll gradient.  xxxd3234xxx  was rapidly taken up and metabolized
to spermidine and an unknown, possibly acetamidopropanal, by spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx 
n1-acetyltransferase (ssat) and polyamine oxidase (pao). most of the spermidine and the
unknown product were found in the cell incubation medium, indicating they were released from
the cell. bis(ethyl) oligoamine analogues of polyamines, such as sl-11144 and sl-11158, as
well as arylamine analogues [bw-1, a bis(phenylbenzyl) 3-7-3 analogue] blocked uptake and
interconversion of  xxxd3234xxx  at micromolar levels and, in the case of bw-1, acted as substrate for
pao. the enc. cuniculi pao activity differed from that found in mammalian cells with respect to ph
optimum, substrate specificity and sensitivity to known pao inhibitors. sl-11158 inhibited
ssat activity with a mixed type of inhibition in which the analogue had a 70-fold higher affinity for
the enzyme than the natural substrate,  xxxd3234xxx . the interest in enc. cuniculi polyamine metabolism
and the biochemical effects of these polyamine analogues is warranted since they cure model
infections of enc. cuniculi in mice and are potential candidates for human clinical trials.

(wittner & weiss, 1999). microsporidia are true eukaryotes
containing a nucleus, nuclear membrane, intracytoplasmic
membrane system, a golgi apparatus, and chromosome
separation on mitotic spindles. no mitochondria or
centrioles are present. microsporidia form characteristic
unicellular spores which extrude a polar tube through which
sporoplasm is passed to inoculate a host cell (wittner &
weiss, 1999). little is known concerning the metabolism
of the microsporidia, except for a few studies identifying
glycolytic enzymes and metabolites which are excystment
requirements (weidner et al., 1999). molecular studies have
recently characterized rna and the full genome sequence
of encephalitozoon (enc.) cuniculi is now known (wittner
& weiss, 1999; katinka et al., 2001).

c. j. bacchi and others

the microsporidia have become increasingly important as
human pathogens in aids. there are approximately eight
genera with species proven to be pathogenic in humans.
enterocytozoon (ent.) bienusi, an enteric parasite which
causes intractable diarrhoea in aids, is the most common
species (wittner & weiss, 1999; weber et al., 1994).
chemotherapy for microsporidia infections has relied on
the benzimidazoles and  xxxd2166xxx , which are generally
effective with exceptions: albendazole is not effective versus
ent. bienusi and  xxxd2166xxx  has cytotoxic effects, especially in
aids patients (didier, 1997; costa & weiss, 2000; dieterich
et al., 1994; weiss et al., 1994a; katiyar et al., 1994).
with this as background, our work has focused on
polyamine metabolism in the microsporidia using enc.
cuniculi as model organism (bacchi et al., 2001). polyamines
are low-molecular-mass polycations, found universally in
cells, which function as cofactors for macromolecule
synthesis, in osmotic control, and as structural facilitators
for nucleic acids (cohen, 1998). the major polyamines are
putrescine, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx . polyamines are
absolutely required for cell division and differentiation
and their internal concentrations are carefully controlled by
synthesis, degradation, excretion and uptake from the
environment. in mammals and many protozoa, synthesis
occurs from the conversion of ornithine to putrescine
through  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) (bacchi & yarlett,
2002), although the enteric parasite cryptosporidium
parvum has a plant-like pathway in which arginine is the
starting point for putrescine synthesis through arginine
decarboxylase (keithly et al., 1997). one or two aminopropyl groups, originating from decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx , are added to putrescine to form spermidine
and  xxxd3234xxx , respectively. the limiting enzymes of
polyamine synthesis are odc and  xxxd3156xxx 
decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ), both of which are highly
inducible and have short half-lives in the cell (marton &
pegg, 1995). mammalian cells, as well as some protozoa,
take up  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine, interconverting them to
spermidine and putrescine, respectively. the key enzymes in
interconversion are spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase (ssat) and polyamine oxidase (pao). ssat is also
highly inducible by exogenous polyamines, and the trio of
odc,  xxxg152xxx  and ssat serves to keep intracellular
polyamines at relatively stable levels (marton & pegg, 1995).
chemotherapeutic interest in the polyamine pathway was
initially spurred by the development of enzyme-activated
inhibitors of odc [dl-a- xxxd2430xxx  hydrochloride ( xxxd1972xxx )] and  xxxg152xxx  (mdl 73811, abeado;
bacchi & yarlett, 2002). although these were not effective
clinically as anti-tumour agents,  xxxd1972xxx  found use clinically
against african sleeping sickness (schechter & sjoerdsma,
1989) and abeado in experimental trypanosome infections
(bitonti et al., 1990). more recent attention, however, has
focused on polyamine analogues such as bis(ethyl)norspermine (be 3-3-3) and bis(ethyl)homospermine (be 4-4-4) as
anti-tumour agents. these agents are taken into mammalian
1216

cells on polyamine transporters and down-regulate odc
and  xxxg152xxx , while up-regulating ssat. the net result is
that polyamine synthesis is shut down while remaining
intracellular polyamines are acetylated and excreted. the
resulting decline in polyamine levels causes apoptosis and
cell death, since the analogues do not substitute functionally
for natural polyamines (marton & pegg, 1995; casero &
woster, 2001; frydman & valasinas, 1999; bernacki et al.,
1995).
our recent work has demonstrated that several classes of
polyamine analogues block in vitro growth of enc. cuniculi
and sterilize host monolayers at micromolar levels. these
agents also cured well-validated laboratory model infections
of enc. cuniculi (zou et al., 2001; bacchi et al., 2002). in the
present study, we examine these analogues for effects on
polyamine metabolism in enc. cuniculi.

methods
strain and growth conditions. enc. cuniculi was obtained from

dr ann cali of rutgers university. it was cultivated in rk-13
(rabbit kidney) or hek (human embryonic kidney, atcc crl1573) cells. cells were grown to 80 % confluency in falcon t-75
flasks (becton-dickinson) at 37 uc in 5 % co2/air, and infected with
56105 spores. infected monolayers were also trypsinized and split
into additional flasks. after 1 week of culture, greater than 50 %
infectivity was obtained. the medium used was minimal eagle’s
medium, earle’s salts, l-glutamine, 7 % (w/v) fetal bovine or newborn calf serum (visvesvara et al., 1991). the medium was changed
twice (rk-15 cells) or three times (hek cells) weekly, and the old
medium containing mature spores was pooled and aseptically stored
at 4 uc.
enzyme preparations. intact mature spores were obtained from
supernatant culture media and stored aseptically at 0–4 uc (bacchi
et al., 2001). spores were washed in 150 mm pbs [0?9 % (w/v)
nacl] containing 1 % (w/v) sds and resuspended in pbs prior to
breaking. spores were poured into 2 ml microfuge tubes containing
425–600 nm glass beads (sigma) and disrupted (6–8 min at 4 uc)
using a mini bead beater (bio spec products) or vortex mixer and
adapter (#13000-50-v1; mo bio laboratories) (weiss et al., 1994b).
homogenate preparations with greater than 90 % breakage (by
microscopy) were collected and cleared by centrifugation at 2200 g
for 10 min. the cleared supernatants were used to determine ssat
and pao activity.
gradient purification of pre-emergent spores. the large-scale

gradient procedure described previously (bacchi et al., 2001) was
used to obtain purified preparations of pre-emergent spores. usually
10 heavily infected (50–80 %) monolayers from falcon t75 flasks
were trypsinized, harvested and ground in a glass vessel for 6–8 min
(3–462 min grinding) at 0–4 uc. the breakage medium contained
w-t medium (described below under ‘incubation studies using preemergent spores’) plus a protease inhibitor cocktail containing
2?7 mm na-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride
(tlck), 0?15 mm aprotinin, 2?2 mm leupeptin and 0?5 mm dtt
in 50 mm kcl/0?15 m na3po4, ph 7?4. cell homogenates were
passed through 12 mm and 5 mm filters and the final filtrate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15 000 g on 50 % (v/v) stock isotonic percoll
(1 ml/11 ml beckman 14689 mm tube; green et al., 1999). two
bands were obtained, a broad one at 1?018–1?035 g ml21 (light
band) and a narrower one at 1?102–1?119 g ml21 (heavy band). we
had demonstrated from the previous study that the heavy band
microbiology 150

polyamine metabolism in encephalitozoon cuniculi
contained pre-emergent spores and immature spores while the light
band contained debris, spore cases and some immature stages
(bacchi et al., 2001). since the heavy fraction exhibited far greater
metabolic activity than the light fraction (bacchi et al., 2001), we
used it for the data presented in the present study. cell counts of
suspensions in several experiments prior to and post-incubation
indicated that no lysis of these forms had occurred.
analysis. polyamine content was quantified by
reversed-phase hplc using a perkin-elmer lc-410 pump and a
percosphere c18-5 m 15064?6 mm column (perkin elmer). heavy
gradient fractions (pre-emergent spores) were extracted with 10 %
(w/v) trichloroacetic acid (tca) at 0–4 uc. denatured protein was
removed by centrifugation and extracts were pre-column derivatized
with 0?8 g o-phthalaldehyde l21 (2 : 1) dissolved in 3 ml methanol
added to 30?9 g boric acid l21 containing 24 g koh l21 (ph 10?4).
the derivatized samples were quantified with a perkin-elmer lc 240
fluorescence detector using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and
an absorption wavelength of 455 nm. signals were integrated using
b-ram (in/us systems) version 3.1 software. concentrations of
polyamines were determined relative to standards. the hplc solvent gradient used and other details have been described previously
(yarlett et al., 1994).
polyamine

enzyme assays. all incubations were at 37 uc. ssat was measured

according to libby et al. (1989) in a reaction containing 0?06 m
bicine buffer (ph 8?0), 0?15–6 mm  xxxd3234xxx  or spermidine,
0?1 mci (0?5 nmol) [1-14c]acetyl-coa and 50 ml spore enzyme preparation. reactions were incubated for 30 min, stopped by addition
of 20 ml 0?5 m hydroxylamine, and placed on ice. reaction tubes
were heated for 3 min in a boiling water bath and centrifuged to
remove protein. clarified reactions were spotted on p-81 phosphocellulose filters. filters were washed with distilled water, then
methanol, dried and counted. activity is expressed as nmol (mg protein)21 (30 min)21.
pao was measured spectrophotometrically (beckman du 640)
according to the method of childs & bardsley (1975) in 0?1 m glycine
buffer (ph 7?0) containing 10 units of horseradish peroxidase
[sigma type via: 1 unit will oxidize 1 mmol 2,29-azino-bis(3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (abts) min21 at 25 uc at
ph 5?0], 5 mm abts and 22–220 mg enc. cuniculi protein. final
volume was 1 ml. assays (in duplicate) were started by addition of
1 mm n1-acetylspermine. assays were linked to reduction of abts by
peroxidase and measurement of oxidized product at 420 nm, using a
six-compartment cell holder at 37 uc. the extinction coefficient of
abts at 420 nm is e=3?66104 m21 cm21 (childs & bardsley, 1975).
studies examining polyamine analogues as substrates of pao had
n1-acetylspermine left out of the reaction. blanks containing protein
but no n1-acetylspermine were run with each reaction, and subtracted
from substrate runs. initial velocity plots were obtained using beckman
kinetics software (beckman instruments).
incubation studies using pre-emergent spores. the effect of

polyamine analogues on polyamine synthesis and interconversion
was examined on intact pre-emergent spores. heavy gradient preparations were incubated in w-t medium based on those employed
by weidner & trager (1973) and weidner et al. (1999) in their studies of nosema excystation and containing 3 mm atp, 1 mm gtp,
0?5 mm nad+, 2 mm  xxxd1292xxx , 0?5 mm acetyl-coa,
1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glucose in 8 mm nacl, 138 mm
na3po4, ph 6?8. we had previously used 150 mm na3po4/0?8 %
nacl (bacchi et al., 2001), but obtained better uptake and synthesis
activity with w-t incubation medium.
pre-emergent spores from heavy gradient fractions were incubated
in the presence of 5 mci (125 pmol) l-[2,3-3h]ornithine/4 nmol
 xxxd2595xxx  for polyamine synthesis and 0?25 mci (2?1 nmol)
http://mic.sgmjournals.org

[1-14c] xxxd3234xxx  for polyamine interconversion in suspensions containing a 250 ml aliquot of cell suspension (100–500 mg protein) in
w-t medium. polyamine analogues and radiolabelled substrates were
added at the start of the 1 or 2 h incubation period. after incubation,
preparations were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min, and pellets were
washed in incubation medium and lysed with 250 ml of 10 % (w/v)
tca. lysates were kept at 0–4 uc overnight and frozen until analysis.
supernatants from incubations were aspirated from pellets and frozen
until analysis. all incubations were done in duplicate.
hplc analysis. lysates and supernatant incubation media from

incubations of intact pre-emergent spores with l-[2,3-3h]ornithine
or [1-14c] xxxd3234xxx  were analysed by hplc using procedures outlined previously (bacchi et al., 2001). an in/us flow-through radiodetector monitored radioactivity and the in/us b-2 ram software
package (in/us systems) was used for data peak integration. using
this system, we obtained the following retention times, based on
radiolabelled standards: ornithine, 12 min; putrescine, 24 min; spermidine, 28 min;  xxxd3234xxx , 31 min. acetamidopropionaldehyde had
a retention time of 3?5 min, based on uv absorption analysis.
uptake studies. pre-emergent spore preparations were incubated
for 15 min in duplicate with varying concentrations of [1–4 terminal
methylenes-14c] xxxd3234xxx , [terminal methylenes-3h(n)]spermidine
[1,4-14c]putrescine or l-[2,3-3h]ornithine. the w-t incubation
medium was used, with 0?2 ml reaction mixtures centrifuged
through 0?2 ml  xxxd2648xxx  at 12 000 g for 0?5 min. aqueous and oil
layers were aspirated, and the tips of microfuge tubes were cut off
and analysed by liquid scintillation counting in the presence of
beckman ready protein scintillation fluor (beckman instruments)
as in goldberg et al. (1998).
protein determination. protein content was estimated by the

bradford method, using bsa as standard.
chemicals. radiolabelled chemicals were purchased as follows:

[1–4 terminal methylenes-14c] xxxd3234xxx  (113 mci mmol21; 4?18 gbq
mmol21), amersham pharmacia biotech; l-[2,3-3h]ornithine
(40 mci mmol21; 1?48 gbq mmol21), moravek biochemicals;
[1-14c]acetyl-coa (59 mci mmol21; 2?2 gbq mmol21); [terminal
methylenes-3h(n)]spermidine (25 mci mol21; 0?93 gbq mmol21);
[1,4-14c]putrescine (110 mci mmol21; 4?07 gbq mmol21), nen life
science products.
polyamine analogues were obtained as follows: sl-11061 (be 464),
sl-11093, sl-11144, sl-11158, dr benjamin frydman, slil biomedical (synthesis: valasinas et al., 2001; bacchi et al., 2002); bw-1,
dr patrick woster, wayne state university (synthesis: zou et al.,
2001). mdl 72521, mdl 72527, mdl 27695,  xxxd1972xxx  and difluoromethylarginine were gifts from marion merrell dow. other chemicals
were obtained from sigma.

results
polyamine content of pre-emergent spores
heavy gradient fractions were analysed by hplc and
fluorescence detection for polyamine content after isolation
and washing. analysis of seven separate preparations yielded
a mean of 38?15±27?8 nmol (mg protein)21 for  xxxd3234xxx 
and 23±15?8 nmol (mg protein)21 for spermidine. neither
putrescine nor cadaverine were found using techniques
sensitive to 50 pmol per sample (yarlett et al., 1994). we
had earlier reported polyamine content of mature, released
spores to include low levels of putrescine as compared to
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  (coyle et al., 1996).

enzymes of polyamine metabolism
mature spores were broken using the beadbeater technique
(weiss et al., 1994b), clarified by centrifugation and, used as
cell-free extracts, assayed for ssat and pao, enzymes of
polyamine degradation. results in table 1 are compared to
previously reported data for the synthetic enzymes odc,
ssat and  xxxg152xxx  (bacchi et al., 2001). pao is four times
more active than  xxxg152xxx  and >17-fold more active than
odc.  xxxd3234xxx  was the preferred substrate for ssat, while
n1-acetylspermine was the most active substrate for pao.
other activity/inhibitor data for ssat and for pao are
given under ‘effects of polyamine analogues on polyamine
metabolism of pre-emergent spore preparations’. arginine
decarboxylase activity was less than 0?0036 nmol (mg
protein)21 (2 h)21 – below the lower limit of detection
for the assay. this activity was not inhibitable by difluoromethylarginine (dfma), a specific inhibitor of the enzyme
(bitonti et al., 1982). likewise, dfma was not an inhibitor
of odc, while  xxxd1972xxx  at 1 mm was 55 % inhibitory
(bacchi et al., 2001).
polyamine synthesis and uptake by heavy
gradient fractions
we had initially examined polyamine metabolism in mature
spores freshly isolated from supernatant culture media, but

found this activity to be very low (bacchi et al., 2001). early
studies on polyamine metabolism in pre-emergent spores
used both heavy and light gradient fractions incubated
in 150 mm na3po4-buffered 0?8 % (w/v) nacl, yielding
wide-ranging results (bacchi et al., 2001). nevertheless,
these data indicated that uptake and conversion of l[2,3-3h]ornithine+500 mm  xxxd2595xxx  to putrescine,
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  occurred at about 12 % of the
rate of interconversion of [1-14c] xxxd3234xxx  to spermidine
and putrescine [55?4 nmol (mg protein)21 (2 h)21, 12
preparations, versus 444?8 nmol (mg protein)21 (2 h)21,
9 preparations, respectively; bacchi et al., 2001].
we also examined uptake of polyamines in pre-emergent
spores to compare rates of uptake. table 2 lists km and vmax
values of an experiment in which pre-emergent spores were
examined in a rapid uptake study. incubation mixtures
(0?2 ml) containing increasing concentrations of radiolabelled ornithine, putrescine, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx 
were centrifuged through 0?2 ml  xxxd2648xxx  at 12 000 g.
incubations of 15 min were used in a procedure we have
used for uptake studies with african trypanosomes and
obtained negligible carry-over of exogenous label (goldberg
et al., 1998). table 2 shows that, of the four molecules
studied,  xxxd3234xxx  had the lowest km value (12?5 nmol) and
the highest vmax [10 000 nmol (15 min)21]. one gauge of

h(n)]spermidine, [1,4-14c]putrescine or l-[2,3-3h]ornithine. cells were centrifuged through 200 ml mineral
oil; the supernatant medium was aspirated. tips of tubes were cut off and counted in beckman ready
protein. michaelis–menten kinetics were used to analyse data.

the efficacy of transport is the vmax/km ratio. for  xxxd3234xxx ,
this ratio was 800, which was >100-fold higher than ratios
obtained with data from other substrates. other preparations yielded similar results.

respectively. with 0?25 mci [terminal methylenes-3h(n)]spermidine as substrate, sl-11144 also inhibited uptake 88?5 %
(single preparation) and sl-11158 58?8 % (48?6–
68?9 %; two preparations) (data not shown).

in a series of experiments, we also examined the effects of
various ionophores and ion channel reagents on  xxxd3234xxx 
uptake. used  xxxd1891xxx –100 mm versus [1-14c] xxxd3234xxx  uptake,
the following agents had little (<10 %) or no effect over
15 min uptake (two preparations, duplicate determinations): gramicidin s, amiloride, nifedipine,  xxxd2737xxx ,
monensin. at 100 mm,  xxxd3484xxx  was 57 % inhibitory
(two determinations: range 10–100 mm) while kcn was
31 % inhibitory and sodium azide was not inhibitory.

in the course of these studies, we found a peak appearing at
3–5 min, which did not correspond to known polyamine
standards or n1-acetylspermine. the peak did, however,
correspond to acetamidopropionaldehyde, a byproduct of
polyamine interconversion which is excreted from cells
(marton & pegg, 1995). the confirmation of the identity of
this peak, however, awaits ms analysis.

effects of polyamine analogues on polyamine
metabolism of pre-emergent spore preparations
in recent work, we had demonstrated that polyamine
analogues having a backbone of repeating n-butyl subunits,
such as pentamines, oligoamines or bis(aryl)-substituted
3-7-3 analogues (fig. 1), sterilized enc. cuniculi-infected
monolayer cells and cured two murine model infections
(bacchi et al., 2002). we began mechanistic studies with
some of the compounds that proved to be active in vivo,
incubating pre-emergent spore preparations with 8 mm
(0?25 mci) [1-14c] xxxd3234xxx  for 1 or 2 h, and examining the
resulting 10 % tca extracts by hplc and radiodetection
for reduction in uptake and interference with  xxxd3234xxx 
interconversion. in an initial series of three experiments,
we found that 10 mm sl-11144 and sl-11158 inhibited
 xxxd3234xxx  uptake by 66 % (59–77 %) and 63 % (32–89 %),

in several experiments, we examined the effects of
polyamine analogues on overall  xxxd3234xxx  uptake, and
production of spermidine and acetamidopropionaldehyde.
table 3 gives results of a typical experiment (duplicate
incubations) using the analogues sl-11061, sl-11158 and
bw-1. in this experiment, we monitored internal (pellet)
as well as external (supernatant medium) concentrations
of  xxxd3234xxx  and products. all three analogues caused
significant (70–80 %) reduction in total  xxxd3234xxx  uptake,
and higher inhibition of spermidine (82–95 %) and
acetamidopropionaldehyde (76–92 %) production. sl11061 had somewhat lower inhibition of total uptake
(69?3 %) as well as lower inhibition of spermidine (82?6 %)
and acetamidopropionaldehyde (76?3 %) production. bw-1,
although having a median effect on total uptake (73?4 %),
inhibited production of both metabolites ¢90 %. although
little spermidine was found as excretion product, acetamidopropionaldehyde was present in control incubations, and
was reduced in sl-11158 (20 %) and bw-1 (27 %) supernatants. if incubations continued for 2 h, supernatant
media of analogue-treated cells had 3?2- to 11?5-fold more
 xxxd3234xxx  remaining in the medium than controls incubated
without analogues (not shown), indicating that less uptake
was occurring in these cells.

enzyme involved in polyamine interconversion is ssat
which in enc. cuniculi has two to three times the activity
with  xxxd3234xxx  rather than spermidine as substrate. in
mammalian cells, ssat has a short (15 min) t1/2 and is
highly inducible (to 1000-fold, or 1 % of total cell protein;

examined a number of compounds as substrates or inhibitors of enc. cuniculi pao, and compared them to findings
in the literature for mammalian pao (table 4). none of
the compounds, used at the concentrations indicated,
affected the commercial horseradish peroxidase reaction
in control reactions with h2o2 as substrate, without
n1-acetylspermine and homogenate.
enc. cuniculi pao utilized n1-acetylspermine and n8acetylspermidine as substrate. it did not utilize  xxxd3234xxx ,
spermidine or bis(benzyl)putrescine. unfortunately, neither
n1- or n8-acetylspermidine nor n1,n12-diacetylspermine
were available for study with the enc. cuniculi pao, but both
are substrates for mammalian pao. in contrast, mammalian
pao utilizes  xxxd3234xxx  n1- but not n8-acetylspermidine,
and uses bis(benzyl)putrescine. mdl 27695 is a bis(benzyl)
3-7-3 polyamine analogue which is debenzylated by
mammalian pao (bitonti et al., 1990), and which is also
used as substrate by the enc. cuniculi pao.  xxxd2951xxx 
was not a substrate for mammalian enzyme but, at
concentrations below 100 mm, was a substrate for enc.
cuniculi enzyme.
the ph optima of the enzymes also differed: ph 10?0 for
mammalian pao and ph 7?0–8?0 for the protozoan
enzyme (table 4). fad superadded to control reaction

discussion
although the microsporidia have been studied as unusual
eukaryotic intracellular parasites for many years, little is
known regarding their metabolism. weidner et al. (1999)
summarized the metabolic capabilities of ameson michaelis,
a parasite of the blue crab, indicating glycolysis proceeded in
http://mic.sgmjournals.org

nd
nd

isolated sporoplasms when exposed to exogenous glucose
and atp. related studies (dolgikh et al., 1997) indicated at
least eight glycolytic enzymes (but not hexokinase) were
present in spores of nosema grylli, and concluded that it
is likely that glycolytically produced nadh is recycled
through a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, since other
glycolytic dehydrogenases were not detectable. since
hexokinase was also not detectable in several studies, it
was postulated that the microsporidia may utilize hexose
phosphates directly from the host (summarized in weidner
et al., 1999).
similarly, the ability of enc. cuniculi to take up  xxxd3234xxx 
and convert it to spermidine and putrescine, coupled with
the high efficacy of  xxxd3234xxx  uptake as opposed to other
polyamines or precursors, makes it likely that this
microsporidian utilizes polyamine salvaged from the host
cell as a major mechanism of acquiring polyamines. the
kinetics of transport indicate it is used by enc. cuniculi to
scavenge any available polyamines from the host cytoplasm.
other protozoan parasites such as trypanosoma cruzi and
trichomonas vaginalis are also believed to obtain most of
their polyamines via exogenous sources (le quesne &
fairlamb, 1996; ariyanayagam & fairlamb, 1997; yarlett
et al., 1994). since  xxxd3234xxx  uptake was not blocked by
monensin, gramicidin s, ouabain or amiloride, but was
inhibited by  xxxd3484xxx , it appears that na+/k+ atpase
was not involved in uptake, but a universal cation
transporter may be responsible. relatively low inhibition
(31 %) of transport obtained with kcn reinforces the

finding that the microsporidia have neither mitochondria
nor a functional cytochrome system (undeen, 1990).
the high activity of exogenous  xxxd3234xxx  uptake in preemergent spores, and the increasing focus on polyamine
analogues as anti-tumour agents (casero & woster, 2001;
frydman & valasinas, 1999), made it imperative that we
examine analogues as anti-microsporidial agents (bacchi
et al., 2002). in mammalian cells, these are taken up through
polyamine transporters and down-regulate polyamine
synthesis while inducing ssat and promoting excretion
of acetylated polyamines. as polyamine levels fall in treated
cells, the concentrations of analogues increase. since they do
not function in cell metabolism as do polyamines, division
stops and apoptosis begins (casero & woster, 2001;
frydman & valasinas, 1999; ha et al., 1998).
in the present study, we worked with pre-emergent spore
fractions, which, although relatively homogeneous, were not
1222

actively dividing cells. thus, effects of analogues seen on
dividing mammalian cells such as ssat induction, reduction in odc and  xxxg152xxx  activities, could not be readily
observed. however, these analogues had several definitive
effects on polyamine metabolism of enc. cuniculi, including
reduction of  xxxd3234xxx  uptake and interconversion (sl11144, sl-11158) and mixed inhibition of ssat (sl-11158).
bw-1 was a substrate for pao and in vivo is thus a likely
competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with n1-acetylspermine
as substrate. the related analogue mdl 27695 [a bis(benzyl)
3-7-3 analogue; fig. 1] is debenzylated by mammalian pao
(bitonti et al., 1990). mdl 27695 at 1 mm had modest
(33 %) substrate activity in the enc. cuniculi pao assay.
bw-1, a bis(phenylbenzyl) 3-7-3 analogue, had higher
substrate activity (54?9 %) in this system, and, used in the
presence of the natural substrate, stimulated enzyme activity, by 2?6-fold (table 5).
these studies indicate that enc. cuniculi has significant
microbiology 150

polyamine scavenging potential with  xxxd3234xxx  the preferred
substrate and it is likely that interconversion of polyamines
readily occurs in this intracellular parasite. sl-11144, sl11158 and bw-1 interfere with polyamine uptake and
interconversion in the intact pre-emergent spores, while sl11158 gives a mixed type of inhibition of parasite ssat.
bw-1 is a substrate for parasite pao and nmr studies in
progress indicate two products are formed from [13c]bw-1,
a carboxylic acid and an aldehyde, which is consistent with
an oxidation pathway (p. woster, personal communication). all these effects occur at similar analogue concentrations, indicating that the mechanism of action of these
agents in vivo targets this pathway.
