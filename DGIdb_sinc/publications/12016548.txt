abstract

hepatotoxic adverse drug reactions have contributed to the decline of many
promising therapies, even among mainstream medication classes ( xxxd370xxx  and troglitazone are recent examples). the spectrum of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugrelated liver toxicity continues to expand, with reports in children, interactive toxicity in
persons with hepatitis c, and recognition of the toxicity of both the preferential and selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors. of the antihypertensive agents, methyldopa is now
rarely prescribed and adverse effects are reported infrequently, whereas cases of liver injury associated with the angiotensin receptor and converting enzyme inhibitors are increasingly reported. of the antidiabetic agents, acarbose,  xxxd2202xxx , metformin, and
 xxxd2364xxx  have been implicated in causing liver injury. to date, the newer thiazolidinediones do not appear to share the hepatotoxic potential of troglitazone, although a
few reports of acute hepatitis have accrued. although liver injury has been associated with
the “statins,” the frequency of such toxicity is lower than that of the background population and the value of biochemical monitoring remains unproved. newer concepts in anticonvulsant hepatotoxicity have been the recognition of the reactive metabolite syndrome,
delineation of the risk factors for  xxxd3485xxx  toxicity, the potential role of carnitine in
preventing  xxxd3485xxx  hepatotoxicity, and the toxicity of second-line antiepileptic
drugs. liver injury associated with newer psychotropic agents, particularly the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is also discussed. the focus of the review is the hepatotoxicity of commonly used drugs with particular reference to recent and novel reports of toxicity. well-known causes of liver injury such as chlorpromazine, phenytoin, and methyldopa are not discussed.

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are
among the most frequently prescribed agents in clinical
practice. a danish survey showed that 2.2% of the danish population were permanently taking nsaids.1 although nsaid hepatotoxicity is less conspicuous than
the effects on the upper gastrointestinal tract, this belies
the fact that serious liver injury can occur, even leading
to withdrawal of agents from clinical use (e.g.,  xxxd370xxx ).2 as is to be expected from compounds with divergent chemical structures, the risk of hepatotoxicity
with this class of drugs is not uniform. the frequency of
liver injury attributable to nsaids among current users
is estimated at about 5 per 100,000 persons per year.3 in
two large epidemiological studies,  xxxd3259xxx  was identified as the nsaid with the highest risk of hepatic drug
reactions.3,4 the duration of treatment does not appear
to be critical; most reported cases occurred within the
first 6 months of treatment. risk factors include concurrent use of other hepatotoxic drugs, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthitis (with diclofenac).5
the use of nsaids by individuals with chronic
liver disease can provoke development of the hepatorenal
syndrome, diuretic-resistant ascites, and gastroesophageal
ulceration, an expected consequence of cyclooxygenase
inhibition in the kidney and gastrointestinal tract.6 in addition, a case-control study suggested that nsaid use
may also be associated with a higher risk of variceal hemorrhage.7 thus, ingestion of an nsaid in the week preceding a variceal bleed was associated with an increased
risk of bleeding (odds ratio 3.8; 95% confidence interval
1.36–11.6) compared with nonbleeders with varices.
aspirin use was likewise an independent predictor of
variceal hemorrhage (odds ratio 2.9).7 it follows that prescribers and individuals with chronic liver disease should
be constantly reminded of the hazards of nsaids. the
beneficial effects expected from such a concerted public
health campaign are best demonstrated by the profound
decline in the incidence of another nsaid-related hepatic disorder, aspirin-related reye’s syndrome in febrile
children.8,9 the following discussion will focus mainly on
the liver toxicity of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors
and commonly used nonselective nsaids.

 xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors
the cox-2 inhibitors are classified according to their
cox-2/cox-1 selectivity. celecoxib and rofecoxib are
categorized as selective;  xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , and
 xxxd2065xxx  as preferential; and the older nsaids (aspirin,
diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin) as nonselective
cox-2 inhibitors.10
selective cox-2 inhibitors

a review of 14 controlled trials involving celecoxib concluded that it had a low potential for liver injury, which
was not significantly different from that in placebotreated patients and actually lower than that observed
with other nsaids.11 five reports of hepatocellular injury with celecoxib have since been published.12–16
onset of symptoms was between 4 days and 4 weeks
after starting celecoxib, and five of six reactions were in
women. liver test abnormalities were consistent with
hepatocellular or mixed liver injury. eosinophilia was
observed in some cases. information on liver histology
is limited to one report16; this case showed intrahepatic
cholestasis with portal tract inflammation. all patients
recovered within 1 to 4 months of discontinuing the
drug.
an unresolved question is the relationship of previous sulfonamide allergy to liver toxicity. current manufacturer recommendations are to withhold celecoxib in
persons with clearly documented sulfonamide allergy
because reports of cross-reactivity and toxicity have been
published.15 although celecoxib does contain a sulfonamide moiety, others have pointed out that the critical
n1- or arylamine substituents (associated with sulfonamide antimicrobial hypersensitivity) are absent.17,18 the
absence of these substituents is cited as the reason for the
low cross-reactivity between sulfonamide and other sulfonamide-containing compounds (thiazides, oral hypoglycemic drugs).17,18 rofecoxib has not been implicated
in liver injury to date.
preferential cox-2 inhibitors

 xxxd2727xxx  has been associated with several instances of
acute hepatitis. the majority of those affected have been
women. onset of symptoms was between 1 and 15
weeks,19,20 although it could be delayed for as long as 8

hepatotoxicity of commonly used drugs/chitturi, george

nonselective cox-2 inhibitors

ibuprofen in adults, ibuprofen rarely causes significant hepatic injury. most reports have been of acute
hepatitis or mixed liver injury.26 associations with
cholestasis, the vanishing bile duct syndrome,27 and
subfulminant hepatitis28 have been recorded but, considering its extensive use, are extremely infrequent. the
report of ibuprofen-related severe hepatotoxicity in a
child is the first instance in this age group.29 although
this is probably rare, it should be remembered that in
children ibuprofen is frequently used as an alternative
antipyretic. a previously healthy child developed progressive cholestasis and the vanishing bile duct syndrome along with stevens-johnson syndrome.29 the association of drug hepatitis with this mucocutaneous
syndrome was previously described in adults.30 the
concurrent occurrence of this immunologically mediated skin disorder endorses the view that immune
mechanisms may contribute to the liver injury.
it has been suggested that individuals with
chronic hepatitis c may be at risk of ibuprofen toxicity.31 one week after commencing ibuprofen, three individuals with chronic hepatitis c developed a fivefold
increase in aminotransferases; positive rechallenge was
documented. these findings need to be validated in
larger case-control studies.
 xxxd3259xxx  the hepatotoxic potential of  xxxd3259xxx  is
worth revisiting because of its resurgence in popularity
due to its proapoptotic effects in familial adenomatous
polyposis and colonic cancer.32 of 91 cases of liver injury attributable to  xxxd3259xxx  reported to the food and
drug administration (fda), 43% showed a cholestatic
pattern, 25% were hepatocellular, and the rest showed a
mixed or indeterminate pattern.33 the female/male
ratio was 3.5:1. over two thirds of affected persons were
over 50 years of age.

a notable finding was the presence of hypersensitivity features in 66%. the latter include fever, rash,
eosinophilia, and occasionally severe reactions such as
the stevens-johnson syndrome. four deaths were recorded, one from fulminant hepatic failure and three
from generalized hypersensitivity.  xxxd3259xxx -induced
acute pancreatitis can further exacerbate the cholestasis
by causing extrahepatic biliary obstruction.34 the predominantly cholestatic liver injury produced by  xxxd3259xxx 
is attributed to its inhibition of canalicular bile salt
transport.35
diclofenac prior to the advent of selective cox-2
inhibitors, diclofenac was the most widely prescribed
nsaid. it has been implicated in over 200 instances of
hepatocellular injury.36–39 acute hepatitis, cholestatic
hepatitis, and rarely chronic hepatitis with autoimmune
features have been observed.40 the frequency of diclofenac-induced hepatotoxicity is approximately 1–5
cases per 100,000 persons exposed.3 anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, and malaise are early symptoms and usually
occur within 3 months of starting treatment (range, 1 to
11 months). fever and rash occur in 25%. biochemical
tests are suggestive of acute hepatitis or mixed liver injury. histologic appearances are of acute lobular hepatitis. in severe cases, bridging necrosis and fibrous expansion of portal tracts may be observed. the prognosis is
usually good with resolution occurring after drug cessation. however, fulminant hepatic failure requiring liver
transplantation has been recorded after inadvertent
rechallenge with diclofenac.41 in some individuals, recovery may be protracted; corticosteroids have been
beneficial in these cases.40
the major metabolic pathway of diclofenac (4hydroxylation) is mediated by the cytochrome p450
(cyp)2c9. one study exploring alternative pathways
of diclofenac metabolism failed to identify any new
cyp2c9 polymorphisms in patients developing hepatotoxicity.42 however, others have correlated in vitro
cytotoxicity with other minor metabolites and have
suggested that altered expression of alternative cytochromes (e.g., cyp2c19) may be involved.43 the hepatic adverse effects of other nonselective nsaids are
summarized in table 1.44–52
newer anti-inflammatory drugs

 xxxd2450xxx  this immunomodulatory agent is licensed for use in rheumatoid arthritis. in clinical trials,
elevation of aminotransferases by more than twice the
upper limit of normal ( 2 uln) and by 3  uln
were observed in 6.6% and 4.4% of participants, respectively.53 all increases in  xxxg941xxx  (alt)
reverted to less than 2  uln with withdrawal of the
drug or even if the treatment was not discontinued.

months.21 liver biopsies usually show centrilobular or
bridging necrosis. occasionally, bland cholestasis is observed.19 hypersensitivity features (blood or tissue eosinophilia) may be present, especially in early-onset liver
injury. combined acute tubular necrosis and liver injury
has been documented.20 resolution usually occurred between 2 and 17 months of stopping  xxxd2727xxx .19,22
however, fatal hepatic failure has been recorded,20,23
particularly when  xxxd2727xxx  was not discontinued after
the onset of symptoms.22 both idiosyncratic and immunoallergic mechanisms have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of liver injury.19  xxxd2561xxx  has been associated with acute hepatitis24 and etodolac25 with causing
fulminant hepatic failure. this class of drugs has been
largely superseded by the selective cox-2 inhibitors.

*liver injury associated with the cox-2 inhibitors is discussed in the text

although published data are not yet available, the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products has received 296 reports of hepatic adverse drug reactions with  xxxd2450xxx . these include 15 patients
with liver failure, 9 of whom died from liver-related
events. most occurred within the first 6 months of
starting treatment (range, 3 days to 3 years). many
(58%) of those affected were taking nsaids and/or
methotrexate, and other confounding factors, such as alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis, were also present.
the manufacturer recommends baseline and
monthly monitoring of liver tests for 6 months followed
by bimonthly testing thereafter. minor alt changes
(<2  uln) should prompt retesting in 2 to 4 weeks.
dose reduction (from 20 to 10 mg) is suggested if alt
remains over 2  uln. persistently abnormal alt or
increases of alt  3 uln should prompt drug withdrawal;  xxxd1684xxx , which facilitates hepatic elimination of  xxxd2450xxx , can also be used. coadministration of methotrexate with  xxxd2450xxx  (a combination
that has not been approved by the fda) can lead to
the development of severe hepatic fibrosis.54 it is therefore noteworthy that 19 of 64 (30%) cases associated
with serious hepatic events were in people using this
combination (more information is available from webbased resources of the manufacturer (http://www.aventispharma.ca) and the american college of rheumatology (http://www.rheumatology.org/research/hotline/
0801leflunomide.html).
infliximab this chimeric monoclonal antibody to
 xxxg2296xxx  is now licensed for use in crohn’s
disease and rheumatoid arthritis. hepatotoxicity was not
observed in premarketing clinical trials.55,56 two reports

of liver injury have been attributed to infliximab. bland
cholestasis developed 19 days after infliximab infusion in
a patient with crohn’s disease.57 serum alkaline phosphatase and alt reached 5  uln along with a moderate increase in bilirubin (19 mg/dl). resolution occurred within 2 months. the other patient, who had
long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, developed acute
hepatitis with interface activity and prominent bile duct
damage.58 antinuclear antibodies (titer 1:640), and antibodies to double-stranded dna were positive. liver
tests normalized within 3 weeks of commencing methylprednisolone. this patient was still receiving a small
dose of steroids after 6 months, although this was for the
treatment of the arthritis rather than the liver disorder.
 xxxd3545xxx  this leukotriene receptor antagonist has
been approved for mild, persistent asthma. in clinical trials, 3.3% of patients using the approved dose showed reversible elevation of aminotransperase (at) levels (>2 
uln) within 3 months of commencement. clinically
significant hepatic injury has been reported in six persons
(five women).59–62 two developed acute liver failure and
have needed liver transplantation.59,60 onset of symptoms
was delayed until 5 to 13 months after starting  xxxd3545xxx 
treatment but can occur as early as 8 weeks after starting
this agent.61 inadvertent rechallenge reproduced the liver
injury in one case.59 explant liver or needle liver biopsies
have shown submassive or massive hepatic necrosis. the
apparent response to corticosteroids in two cases59,62 and
hypersensitivity features in another, along with tissue
eosinophilia in four of the six patients, are suggestive of
immune-mediated mechanisms of liver injury. however,
the absence of hypersensitivity characteristics in other reports suggests metabolic idiosyncrasy.60,61

antihypertensive drugs
among the established antihypertensive agents, methyldopa-related liver injury is perhaps best characterized
(table 2).63 although the general use of methyldopa is
declining, it is still used in managing gestation-induced
hypertension. by contrast, the beta-adrenergic receptor
blockers, with the exception of  xxxd2435xxx , have low hepatotoxic potential.64–67  xxxd2435xxx  has been associated with
severe acute hepatitis, including instances of submassive
or massive hepatic necrosis.68 calcium channel blockers are
also infrequently implicated in causing acute liver injury,
including steatohepatitis.69–71 as discussed in the review
by farrell in this issue of seminars, the association of calcium channel blockers with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(nash) may be coincidental, reflecting the close relationship between nash and the insulin resistance syndrome (of which hypertension is a component).

inhibitors of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone axis
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors

representatives of this class of drugs (captopril,
enalapril, fosinopril) have usually been implicated in
causing bland cholestasis or cholestatic hepatitis.72 hepatocellular injury73–76 has also been described. duration of treatment has varied from 1 week to 1 year, with
a mean of 14 weeks.76 hepatotoxicity can follow dose
escalation in persons who have remained well on a stable dose for 2 years. rarely, severe toxicity has been reported after 3 years of treatment.77 however, rechallenge was not performed in this case, and the effects of
drug withdrawal could not assessed because of death
from acute liver failure; this makes it difficult to assign
definite causality.
hallmarks of hypersensitivity such as fever, skin
rash, and eosinophilia may be evident.73 recovery is
usual, but serum alkaline phosphatase may remain abnormal for up to 18 months.72 fulminant hepatic failure

is a rare complication and has been reported with lisinopril78 and enalapril.77 cross-reactivity between ace inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) has been observed, although this is not a consistent finding.79
 xxxg99xxx  receptor inhibitors

long-term follow-up data are yet to accrue for these
antihypertensive agents. in the published cases, liver
toxicity has been observed with irbesartan (cholestatic
hepatitis),80 candesartan (transient rise in aminotransferases, hepatocellular injury),81–83 and losartan (hepatocellular injury).84 losartan is of particular interest
because of its potential role in treating portal hypertension.85,86 although reports of losartan-induced hepatic
injury are few (to date),84,87 better definition of its hepatotoxic potential is required. however, this issue may be
largely academic because preliminary results have not
shown clear advantages over conventional beta-blocker
therapy.86
 xxxg1602xxx  antagonist
(spironolactone)

although spironolactone is not used as an antihypertensive agent, extensive experience with its use in chronic
liver disorders has not revealed significant hepatotoxicity.
however, when used as an antiandrogen in persons
with diffuse alopecia or primary hyperaldosteronism,88–90
spironolactone can occasionally cause a significant increase in aminotransferase levels. it may be recalled that
other antiandrogens ( xxxd2143xxx , cyproterone) are recognized causes of acute hepatocellular injury.91,92

drugs used in the treatment of
diabetes mellitus
although many therapeutic agents used in treating diabetes have been implicated as causing liver injury, it
should be remembered that preexisting liver disorders
(such as nash or hepatitis c) are common in this
population of patients.93

sulfonylureas
whereas the prototype compounds such as carbutamide
were associated with significant liver toxicity, subsequent generations of sulfonylureas such as  xxxd1678xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , and  xxxd3392xxx  have
been occasionally implicated in liver toxicity (table
3).94–100 recent additions include gliclazide101,102 and
 xxxd2203xxx .103 fever, rash, and eosinophilia may be
present, consistent with a hypersensitivity-related reaction. recovery is usual with drug cessation. however,
some individuals can develop the vanishing bile duct
syndrome97 or even die from liver failure.104,105

metformin
this biguanide has been associated in two reports with
acute cholestatic hepatitis106 and one case of bland
cholestasis.107 symptoms of acute hepatitis developed
2–4 weeks after taking metformin. full recovery was
observed in all three cases.

glucosidase inhibitors
the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are used as adjuvant
therapy in type 2 diabetes.108 they ameliorate postprandial glycemia by interfering with the digestion of dietary polysaccharides. acarbose has been incriminated in
several reports of dose-related hepatotoxicity,109–111 usually at doses in excess of 100 mg/day. the majority of
reported cases have been from spain. onset is between
2 and 8 months after beginning treatment. although
histological information is limited, the description in
available reports has been of acute hepatitis. complete
recovery follows drug withdrawal. other glucosidase inhibitors include  xxxd3524xxx , which has been associated
with intrahepatic cholestasis,112 and  xxxd2644xxx . the latter
has not been associated with hepatic toxicity.113

thiazolidinediones
the thiazolidinediones (tzds) represent a novel class
of insulin-sensitizing agents. troglitazone, the first
member of this group, was withdrawn after being implicated in over 100 cases of hepatotoxicity,114–119 including several deaths or referrals for liver transplantation.120,121 although an increase in aminotransferases
was observed in less than 2% of recipients, the premarketing experience with troglitazone did not identify an
untoward potential for serious hepatotoxicity.122 serious
liver injury was recorded mainly in women (female/
male, 2:1) and obese individuals; the latter could reflect
the phenotype of the usual person with type 2 diabetes.
although a progressive course was observed with concurrent use of simvastatin,123 interaction of troglitazone
with other drugs and the influence of preexisting liver
disease have not emerged as important risk factors for
troglitazone-induced liver injury.
in cases of troglitazone hepatotoxicity, symptoms
were often delayed for up to 9 months after commencing treatment (mean 4 months; range, 8 days to 12
months).124–126 presenting features included nausea, fatigue, jaundice, vomiting, and symptoms of liver failure.
even among cases diagnosed in the presymptomatic
stage with liver test abnormalities, progression to acute
liver failure was often rapid. of particular concern in
some cases, liver injury progressed despite discontinuation of troglitazone intake.103,127 histologic appearances
were of submassive or massive hepatic necrosis, with
postcollapse scarring, bile duct proliferation, or severe
cholestatic hepatitis.114–119,128
troglitazone is metabolized by cyps 3a4 and
2c8 to a quinone metabolite, which raises the possibility of quinone-related liver injury (similar to that with
acetaminophen or quinolone antibiotics and antimalarials).120 the mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities
observed in persons with nash were accentuated in

rarely,  xxxd2364xxx  can cause a reversible increase in
gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (>30  uln), along
with an increased alt (2–45  uln).139 positive
rechallenge has been documented. because of problems
of cross-reactivity, the choice of an insulin preparation for
ongoing treatment can be difficult. change to a porcine
insulin mixture may occasionally be beneficial.139

lipid-lowering agents
 xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors (the “statins”)
elevation of liver enzymes ( 3 uln) appears to be a
class effect of most lipid-lowering drugs, including the
 xxxd32xxx  (hmg-coa
reductase) inhibitors, with the exception of  xxxd1684xxx  (table 4).140 such liver test abnormalities are observed in less than 3% of recipients,141 are usually dose
dependent, and occur within 3 months of therapy. the
biochemical changes often settle despite continuation of
statin therapy. although there are clearly documented
reports of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver failure
with the hmg-coa inhibitors,141–148 the overall frequency of serious liver injury (0.2 per 100,000 persons
exposed) is lower than that of the background population and considerably less than that associated with
drugs such as the nsaids.140 no consistent pattern of
toxicity has emerged (table 4).
although rhabdomyolysis is well recognized in
individuals using a combination of the  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors and gemfibrozil, concurrent liver injury with statin-fibrate combinations is extremely rare.149
therefore, a recent report of hepatotoxicity with the
statins (simvastatin, pravastatin) and another fibric acid
derivative ( xxxd2096xxx ) is of considerable interest.150 despite careful monitoring, two patients developed chronic
hepatitis with fibrosis, transient antinuclear and smooth
muscle antibodies, and interface hepatitis suggesting autoimmune hepatitis.150 however, it should be noted that
 xxxd2096xxx  has been implicated in causing autoimmune
hepatitis, ductopenia, and fibrosis.151–154 the long-term
implications for such combination therapy are uncertain.
conflicting evidence has been presented with regard to
cross-toxicity between the  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors. although atorvastatin could be successfully instituted in a person with a history of simvastatin-related
toxicity, the introduction of pravastatin led to the recrudescence of liver injury.143
although monitoring of liver tests at baseline,
within 12 weeks, and every 6 months thereafter is recommended, the cost effectiveness of this approach has
not been validated. there are also significant compliance issues in such protocol testing.155 finally, it is not
clear whether regular monitoring (as noted before) can

recipients of troglitazone.128 troglitazone sulfate, a
metabolite of troglitazone, inhibits hepatobiliary export
of bile acids by competing with the bile salt export
pump129 (for a discussion of canalicular transporters and
biliary excretion of drugs, see the review by bohan and
boyer in this issue of seminars); how this translates into
acute liver failure is not clear. although peripheral
eosinophilia has been reported in association with
troglitazone hepatotoxicity (consistent with hypersensitivity),130 this appears to be an exceptional rather than
typical finding; an idiosyncratic metabolic basis for the
liver injury is more highly favored.
at the present time, the second-generation
tzds rosiglitazone and pioglitazone do not appear to
have the hepatotoxic potential of troglitazone. although they share structural similarity, their metabolic
pathways differ. alt elevations (>3  uln) were
noted in 0.25% of patients treated with rosiglitazone
and 0.26% treated with pioglitazone, and this frequency
was not significantly different from that in placebotreated recipients.131,132
rosiglitazone has been associated with two reports of hepatotoxicity.133,134 onset of liver injury (1 to
3 weeks) was much earlier than observed with troglitazone. both patients recovered. an alternative diagnosis
of ischemic hepatitis (or ischemia-reperfusion injury)
was suggested for one of the reported cases because
of the high levels of alt recorded (11,000 u/l)
and rapid resolution (within 9 days).135 pioglitazone has
been implicated in one report of reversible acute hepatocellular injury developing 6 months after starting
therapy. although the person was also receiving other
potentially hepatotoxic drugs ( xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd3524xxx ), liver tests had been normal before and for 6
months after commencement of pioglitazone.136 withdrawal of the latter led to a rapid improvement in liver
tests, with normalization of alt within 1 month. reversible elevation of alkaline phosphatase has also been
observed with pioglitazone in the absence of other liver
test abnormalities.137
the current fda recommendations are to perform baseline liver tests (pretreatment alt should be
< 2.5  uln) and tests every 2 months thereafter during the first year of therapy with tzds. discontinuation of the drug is recommended if alt levels remain
persistently elevated (>3  uln). however, this protocol has not been validated with histology or clinical
outcomes. considering the rapidity of liver failure in
patients treated with troglitazone,126 biochemical monitoring should not replace prompt clinical assessment of
prodromal symptoms suggestive of adverse drug reaction or hepatitis. individuals with a history of troglitazone-induced hepatitis should not receive other thiazolidinediones, although rosiglitazone was successfully
substituted for troglitazone in one case.138

antiepileptics
the hepatic adverse effects of first-line antiepileptic
drugs are well recognized (table 5). recent developments include the recognition of the reactive metabolite
syndrome, the further characterization of risk factors for
 xxxd3485xxx  hepatotoxicity, and the potential role of
carnitine in treatment of this form of drug-induced liver
injury.
the triad (fever, rash, internal organ involvement) of hypersensitivity features seen with anticonvulsants forms the basis of the reactive metabolite syndrome
(rms).156,157 phenytoin was one of the first drugs associated with the rms (also known as the anticonvulsant
hypersensitivity syndrome or “pseudomononucleosis”
syndrome), but association with other aromatic anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and also lamotrigine has been observed.158 the
frequency of the rms is estimated  xxxd1891xxx –100 per
100,000 persons exposed. onset of symptoms is within
1 to 8 weeks of exposure, usually with fever, malaise, and
sore throat followed by variable (often severe) cutaneous

reactions. systemic manifestations include lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, and involvement of the liver, kidney, bone marrow, and lung. liver test abnormalities are
seen in 50%, and occasional instances of severe hepatitis
have been described. the pathogenesis of this syndrome
is thought to involve the generation of reactive metabolites. defective detoxication of a highly reactive arene
oxide metabolite was initially proposed, but other metabolites may be more important.157 the relationship of
metabolic toxicity to profound drug hypersensitivity is
less clear, but neoantigenic determinants of immune reactivity, cytokine mobilization, and defects in cell defenses against oxidative stress and proinflammatory
stressors are potential candidates (see also review by
kaplowitz in this issue of seminars for a discussion of
current concepts of the mechanisms of drug-induced
liver injury). counseling of family members is crucial
because the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions
among first-degree relatives is about one in four.
risk factors for  xxxd3485xxx  (vpa)-induced liver
injury are now well delineated. although the frequency
of this event is approximately 1 per 37,000 persons exposed,159 the risk is much more pronounced (1 per 500
exposed) in certain groups: children younger than 3
years of age, a personal or family history of mitochon-

trilobular necrosis.173 a reversible increase in alt
(>700 u/l) with hypoalbuminemia and mild hyperammonemia was also observed in another patient.174 liver
biopsy was not performed.

 xxxd2090xxx 
the fda has received over 30 reports of serious hepatotoxicity with  xxxd2090xxx , including five liver-related
deaths.175 the frequency of liver injury is estimated as 3
to 4 per 100,000 persons exposed (similar to that of
vpa).176 fifty percent of reported cases have occurred
between 3 and 6 months (range, 1 to 7 months) of
starting drug intake.  xxxd2090xxx  should be reserved for
treating drug-refractory epilepsy and lennox-gastaut
syndrome.176 a reactive metabolite, atropaldehyde, is
implicated in causing both the liver injury and the other
main adverse effect of  xxxd2090xxx , aplastic anemia.177

psychotropic drugs
lamotrigine
lamotrigine is used in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures and as adjunctive therapy in children
with treatment-resistant epilepsy. acute hepatitis has
been reported in six individuals, including fulminant
hepatic failure in one case.169 all were receiving concurrent antiepileptic drugs (sodium valproate, carbamazepine).169–172 onset was between 2 and 3 weeks. extrahepatic features such as rash, disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy, and rhabdomyolysis were occasionally
present. histologic appearances were of acute hepatic
necrosis169 or focal hepatitis with mild portal inflammation.171 of the six patients, four recovered completely
and one had mildly abnormal liver tests. liver tests had
normalized in one other patient at the time of her death
(from pulmonary embolism). the mechanism of liver
toxicity is unclear. immune-mediated mechanisms (as
part of the rms) may be important, but hypersensitivity features are not always present. interactive toxicity
with other antiepileptic drugs leading to the production
of a toxic metabolite is an alternative hypothesis. in one
case,170 the prior use of vpa (withdrawn 2 days before)
was thought to have increased serum lamotrigine levels
above the desired therapeutic range. increased lamotrigine levels have not been observed in other cases.

topiramate
this anticonvulsant is used as an add-on drug in persons with partial onset epileptic seizures, generalized
tonic-clonic seizures, and lennox-gastaut syndrome.
to date, there has been only one report of serious liver
toxicity; a case of acute hepatic failure necessitating liver
transplantation in a woman who had also been receiving carbamazepine.173 the explanted liver showed cen-

antipsychotic and sedative-hypnotic drugs
cholestasis is a well-recognized side effect of the older
antipsychotic agents178–181 such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol,  xxxd3018xxx , and sulpiride (table 6). the
prognosis for recovery of liver function is good, but protracted cholestasis and the vanishing bile duct syndrome181 may occur in a proportion of affected individuals (7% with chlorpromazine). by contrast, clozapine182
and risperidone183 have been associated with predominantly hepatocellular injury, including reports of fulminant hepatic failure in the case of clozapine.182 acute
hepatitis accompanied by hallmarks of a hypersensitivity
syndrome has been observed with olanzapine.184 the
benzodiazepines have a very low propensity to cause
liver injury; both hepatocellular and cholestatic reactions
have been described, but these historic reports usually
predated the accurate diagnosis of viral hepatitis. the
only members of this class associated with significant
hepatotoxicity are  xxxd1731xxx  (severe hepatitis)185 and
bentazepam (chronic hepatitis).186 these two drugs are
not available in the united states.

antidepressants
significant liver injury was associated with some of the
older antidepressants, such as the monoamine oxidase
inhibitors, particularly iproniazid. the tricyclic antidepressants were also implicated in instances of predominantly cholestatic liver injury, with occasional descriptions of prolonged cholestasis and the vanishing bile
duct syndrome.187,188 the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are now the most frequently prescribed
antidepressants. abnormal liver tests are seen in up to
0.5% of long-term recipients of fluoxetine.189 however,

reye’s syndrome, friedreich’s ataxia, a sibling affected by
vpa hepatotoxicity, and multiple drug therapy.160–163
vpa therapy is associated with carnitine depletion, which can impair mitochondrial function.164
carnitine is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial
beta-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx .165 a preliminary study
compared 20 patients with  xxxd3485xxx  hepatotoxicity
receiving l-carnitine supplementation with a group of
50 patients managed conservatively. there was significantly increased survival (48%) among those receiving
carnitine compared with survival figures of only 10% in
the nontreated group.166 liver transplantation has been
performed in individuals developing vpa-induced
acute liver failure. however, the poor neurological outcome in some individuals has led investigators to question the wisdom of performing liver transplantation for
this indication.167,168

overt hepatotoxicity is rare.190,191 most reports have
been of reversible acute hepatocellular injury, usually
occurring between a few weeks and 1 year after commencing treatment. on the other hand, drug monitoring agencies have received numerous reports of acute
hepatitis with fluoxetine and other ssris.192 the low
frequency of published reports of liver injury is ascribed
to the long latent period before the onset of overt toxicity; of 22 trials conducted using ssris, only one lasted
for more than 8 weeks. recovery is usual but can take
up to 9 months.190 chronic hepatitis has also been described with fluoxetine. however, the history of intermittent binge drinking in this individual along with a
record of anti–hepatitis c antibody positivity casts some
doubts on this association.193 transient liver test abnormalities and occasional cases of acute and chronic hepatitis have been attributed to paroxetine.194–196
nefazodone has been associated with at least five
reports of acute liver failure.197–199 onset was between 7
to 28 weeks after starting treatment. liver explants have
shown centilobular or submassive hepatic necrosis. although one patient recovered with supportive care,200
others have died or have needed liver transplantation.
trazodone has been implicated in cases of acute and
chronic hepatocellular injury and also cholestasis.201,202
the latent period can be as long as 18 months.203 severe
hepatotoxicity has also occurred in combinations with

other antidepressants204 or with other antipsychotic
agents.205

concluding remarks
hepatic adverse drug reactions remain a persistent concern in the prescription of many commonly used drugs
in clinical practice. in some instances, the frequency and
severity of adverse drug reactions have led to drug withdrawal, whereas in others (e.g., the statins), increased
experience with their extensive use has verified their
overall safety profile and good risk-benefit ratio. vigilant monitoring remains the cornerstone of early diagnosis and more effective management. a key feature is
the development of late adverse drug reactions not
picked up by short-term clinical trials (e.g., ssris).
thus, postmarketing surveillance continues to be paramount with every newly introduced agent.
