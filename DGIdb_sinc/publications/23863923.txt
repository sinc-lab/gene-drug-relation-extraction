abstract
the putative antidepressant  xxxd429xxx  is a  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist and agonist at sigma-1 and d3 dopamine receptors, exerts an anti-immobility
action in the forced swim paradigm, and enhances dopamine turnover in the frontal cortex.  xxxd429xxx  has also been found to ameliorate
stress-induced anhedonia, reduce the associated elevations of hypothalamic  xxxd1752xxx -releasing factor (crf) and restore the reductions in
hypothalamic bdnf expression. here we demonstrate chronic administration of  xxxd429xxx  to have no significant effect on hypothalamic crf
expression through sigma-1 receptor agonism; however, both sigma-1 receptor agonism or  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism were necessary to enhance bdnf
expression. regulation of bdnf expression by  xxxd429xxx  was associated with increased phosphorylation of transcription factor creb and mediated
through sigma-1 receptor agonism but blocked by  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism. the existence of two separate signalling pathways was confirmed by
immunolocalisation of each receptor to distinct cell populations in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. increased bdnf induced by
 xxxd429xxx  was also associated with enhanced expression of synapsin, but not  xxxg642xxx , suggesting induction of long-term structural plasticity
between hypothalamic synapses. these unique features of  xxxd429xxx  may contribute to its ability to ameliorate stress-induced anhedonia as the
hypothalamus plays a prominent role in regulating hpa axis activity.

introduction
brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  (bdnf) has been described as
a potential biomarker of depression and is consistently reported to
be reduced in both the plasma and post-mortem brain tissue of
patients with depression (chen et al., 2001; gass and hellweg,
2010; grønli et al., 2006; karege et al., 2002; karege et al., 2005;
takebayashi et al., 2011). many clinically effective antidepressants are known to enhance bdnf expression, mainly in the cortex and hippocampus, and this is believed to contribute, in part,
to their therapeutic effects (alboni et al., 2010; de foubert
et al., 2004; nibuya et al., 1995). in marked contrast to this
regional specificity attributed to most antidepressant drugs,
we recently demonstrated the putative antidepressant  xxxd429xxx  (2-[(4-butylsulfanylphenyl)-phenyl-methyl]-n,n-dimethylethanamine) to specifically increase bdnf protein in the mouse
hypothalamus and to be without effect on its expression in either
the frontal cortex or hippocampus. this relatively unique feature
of  xxxd429xxx  may be important in its ability to ameliorate
stress-induced anhedonia as the hypothalamus plays a prominent
role in regulating both hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis
activity (kageyama and suda, 2009) and the ability to evaluate
and respond appropriately to reward (nocjar et al., 2012).
 xxxd429xxx  was originally identified in a systematic re-evaluation of neurotherapeutics removed from the market by the
united states food and drug administration (fda) in an administrative process known as the drug efficacy study implementation
(desi) (greene and podolsky, 2012; shorter, 2002). previously,

 xxxd429xxx , an antihistamine derivative of diphenhydramine,
was marketed as a sedative and anxiolytic under trade names such
as  xxxd429xxx ,  xxxd429xxx  and  xxxd429xxx . more recently,  xxxd429xxx 
has been suggested to be useful in controlling withdrawal symptoms in patients being weaned from the habitual use of benzodiazepines (mercier-guyon et al., 2004). the desi process, in
essence, arose from the kefauver-harris amendments (1962) to
the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (1938), which required
the clinical efficacy of all marketed pharmaceuticals to be more
rigorously demonstrated despite being generally regarded as safe
in humans. the drug-like qualities of  xxxd429xxx  were identified using web-based data sources and its psychotropic actions
evaluated using a modified smithkline beecham, harwell,
imperial college, royal london hospital phenotype assessment
(shirpa) protocol. a combination of in vitro and in vivo procedures employing ligand-binding, cell signalling in receptortransfected cells and the forced swim paradigm, using a dose

range of 3–5 mg/kg, demonstrated  xxxd429xxx  to be polyvalent,
acting as an antagonist at the  xxxg1115xxx  and as an agonist at
the sigma-1 and dopamine d3 receptors (ring et al., 2013). the
anti-immobility actions of  xxxd429xxx  were mediated by its
agonist action at the sigma-1 receptor and antagonist action at the
 xxxg1115xxx , actions previously associated with clinically
effective antidepressants (clenet et al., 2001; dekeyne et al.,
2008; urani et al., 2002).
a unique feature observed with chronic administration of  xxxd429xxx  (5 mg/kg, seven days) was its ability to ameliorate
stress-induced anhedonia and the associated increases hypothalamic  xxxd1752xxx -releasing factor (crf) (ring et al., 2013).
stress-induced anhedonia is a core symptom of depression (nestler
and carlezon, 2006), and the hypothalamic release of crf plays a
central role in controlling the stress response by regulating the
activity of the hpa axis (kageyama and suda, 2009).  xxxd429xxx 
not only attenuated hypothalamic crf signalling but also enhanced
bdnf protein expression. this effect was observed only in the
hypothalamus, and  xxxd429xxx  had no effect on bdnf protein
expression in the frontal cortex or hippocampus (ring et al., 2013).
the ability of  xxxd429xxx  to attenuate crf hyperactivity in
the hpa axis and stress-induced deficits in bdnf expression may
prove to be an important aspect in its putative antidepressant
actions as these two parameters are the most commonly reported
pathological features in patients with depression (karege et al.,
2005; hashimoto, 2010; piwowarska et al., 2012). it is perhaps not
surprising, therefore, that  xxxd429xxx  acts to reduce crf and
increase bdnf in the same brain region as it has been previously
reported that chronic hpa axis hyperactivity can negatively influence growth factors such bdnf (smith et al., 1995). many other
 xxxg1115xxx  antagonists with clinical antidepressant properties
are known to increase bdnf expression in the hippocampus and
frontal cortex (dekeyne et al., 2008; ladurelle et al., 2012) and
similar effects are observed with sigma-1 receptor agonists
(kikuchi-utsumi and nakaki, 2008). however, the mechanism by
which  xxxd429xxx  mediates this hypothalamus-specific neuroplastic action remains to be established. here we provide evidence
to suggest that  xxxd429xxx  enhances hypothalamic bdnf protein expression by acting on a direct sigma-1 receptor signalling
pathway and through an indirect mechanism involving the 5-ht2c
receptor both actions ultimately resulting in creb phosphorylation which regulates bdnf transcription (conti et al., 2002;
tabuchi et al., 2002). secondly, we show the action of bdnf to be
correlated with enhanced synapsin expression, a marker of presynaptic plasticity (cesca et al., 2010), but to have no influence on
postsynaptic density protein-95 ( xxxg642xxx ) expression, suggesting it
unlikely to increase synaptic complement.

materials and methods
source and maintenance of c57bl6 mice
c57bl6 male mice, five weeks old, were purchased from harlan
laboratory (uk) and were housed in the ucd biomedical
facility in groups of three to five animals in a holding cage supplemented with a cardboard tube shelter. animals were maintained at 22±2°c and 40±5% humidity in a 12-hour light-dark
cycle with ad libitum access to food and water and allowed to
acclimate to the biomedical facility for three weeks prior to any
experiment. the experimental procedures were approved by the

animal research ethics committee of university college dublin,
conformed to the eu council directive 86-609-eec, and were
carried out by individuals retaining the appropriate license issued
by the irish department of health.

drug administration schedules
drugs and vehicle were administered via the peritoneal cavity
(i.p.) route at the same time daily for seven days and all animals
were drug free for 24 hours prior to sacrifice.  xxxd429xxx  was
custom synthesised (almac, uk; topchem, irl) and administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg which, in preliminary studies, had been
demonstrated to yield maximal effects in behavioural paradigms
(ring et al., 2013). rimcazole (5 mg/kg) was purchased from
tocris biosciences (uk) and ritanserin (4 mg/kg) was purchased
from sigma aldrich (uk). the drugs were dissolved in saline
(0.9% nacl in distilled water) except for ritanserin, which was
dissolved in an aqueous solution containing  xxxd1896xxx 
(1% v/v; dmso). drugs and vehicle were administered in a final
injection volume of 10 ml/kg. all animals were randomly
assigned to the treatment groups (n = 4–6).

analysis of brain tissue bdnf and crf levels
tissue preparation and protein extraction. animals, drug free
for 24 hours, were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and hippocampus, hypothalamus and frontal cortex were quickly dissected, snap frozen in cryotubes using liquid nitrogen, and stored
at −80°c until use. when required, the samples were thawed and
homogenised in 10% w/v stock lysis buffer (20 mm tris, ph 8,
containing 150 mm nacl, 1% v/v nonidet-p40, 10% v/v glycerol,
1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, the latter two being included as protease and phosphatase
inhibitors, respectively). the samples were homogenised by sonication for three seconds using a probe sonicator (soniprep-150;
sanyo, japan), centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°c to
pellet nuclear material and other cellular debris, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °c in 25 µl aliquots until needed. protein
concentrations were determined using the bca™ assay, according to manufacturer’s instructions (pierce, usa).

crf and bdnf immunoassays
the concentration of crf in hypothalamic protein extracts was
determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)
(phoenix pharmaceuticals inc, usa) (feng et al., 2007) using a
standard curve ranging from 0.01 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml crf.
bdnf concentrations were also determined by elisa (promega,
usa) (angelucci et al., 2003) and a standard curve ranging from
7.8 to 500 pg/ml bdnf.

analysis of creb phosphorylation status and
 xxxg642xxx  and synapsin expression
protein samples were boiled for three minutes in 70 mm trishcl, ph 6.8 containing 33 mm nacl, 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), 2% w/v  xxxd3215xxx  (sds),
0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol and 3% v/v

polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (biorad, uk). remaining reactive groups on the
nitrocellulose sheet were then inactivated using tris-buffered
saline solution (tbs-t) blocking buffer (10 mm tris–hcl, ph
7.4, containing 150 mm nacl, 0.05% v/v tween-20, and 5% w/v

membrane was subsequently incubated overnight (20 hours) at
4°c in blocking buffer (5% v/v) containing the appropriate antibody. these included anti-phospho-camp-responsive element
binding protein (creb)(ser133) (rabbit monoclonal immunoglobulin g (igg); cell signaling technology, usa; diluted
1:10,000 v/v), anti-creb (rabbit polyclonal igg; cell signaling
technology, usa; diluted 1:10,000 v/v), anti- xxxg642xxx  (rabbit
polyclonal igg; cell signaling technology, usa; diluted 1:5000
v/v). the membrane was then incubated for one hour in tbs-t
containing a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
igg antibody (novagen, uk; 1:10,000 dilution), reacted for five
minutes with a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (pierce,
usa) and exposed to x-ray ﬁlm (fuji, uk). the x-ray ﬁlms were
scanned and converted into a digital format and the immunostained band density analysed using imagej software (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/index.html). the staining density of phospho-creb was expressed as percentage of total creb and those
of synapsin and  xxxg642xxx  as a percentage of total protein as measured by incubation of the nitrocellulose membrane with napthol
blue (0.1% w/v; sigma, uk).

results

frozen brain sections (12 mum) were taken throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the pvn (bregma −0.82 mm to −0.92 mm)
(paxinos and watson, 2007), thaw-mounted onto glass slides,
immersion-ﬁxed for 30 minutes in 70% (v/v) ethanol and incubated overnight with either goat polyclonal anti- xxxg1115xxx 
antibody (diluted 1:100; abcam, uk), rabbit polyclonal anti-crf
polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:500; chemicon, uk) or rabbit polyclonal anti- xxxg2072xxx  (sigma-1 receptor) antibody (diluted 1:200;
abcam, uk). the sections were washed and subsequently exposed
for three hours to donkey anti-goat alexa-488 (diluted 1:500;
invitrogen, uk) or donkey anti-rabbit dylight-594 (diluted 1:500;
pierce, usa) and counterstained with 0.5 µg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
(sigma, uk). for dual-immunolabelling sections were initially
incubated with goat polyclonal anti- xxxg1115xxx  antibody
(diluted 1:100; abcam, uk) for three hours and subsequently incubated overnight with either rabbit polyclonal anti-crf antibody
(diluted 1:500; chemicon, uk) or rabbit polyclonal anti- xxxg2072xxx 
(sigma-1 receptor) antibody (diluted 1:200; abcam, uk). the second-layer antibodies were employed as described above. all antibodies were diluted in 0.1 m pbs containing 1% (w/v) bsa and
1% (v/v) normal goat serum (ngs). images were acquired using a
lsm pascal v confocal microscope (zeiss, germany).

as reported previously,  xxxd429xxx  significantly reduced crf
and increased bdnf protein expression in the hypothalamus of
c57bl6 mice following its chronic administration (5 mg/kg, seven
days) (ring et al., 2013). crf protein expression became significantly reduced (p = 0.03, student’s t test) and this effect could not
be reversed by the sigma-1 receptor antagonist rimcazole (4 mg/
kg; p < 0.05, one-way anova) and was not further reduced by
co-administration of the 5-ht2c antagonist ritanserin (5 mg/kg; p
< 0.05, one-way anova) (figure 1(a)). these data indicated that
the effect of  xxxd429xxx  in reducing hypothalamic crf could
not be attributed to its actions at the sigma-1 or 5-ht2c receptors.
in contrast, the ability of  xxxd429xxx  to enhance bdnf expression was blocked by co-administration of rimcazole and significantly enhanced by co-administration of ritanserin (p = 0.03,
student’s t test; n = 6) (figure 1(b)).  xxxd429xxx  was without
effect on bdnf expression in the hippocampus (p = 0.16,
student’s t test; n = 6) or frontal cortex (p = 0.78, student’s t test;
n = 6) of c57bl6 mice (data not shown), as we have reported
previously.

by activation of its phosphorylation state. chronic administration
of  xxxd429xxx  was found to significantly increase hypothalamic
creb phosphorylation state (p = 0.03, student’s t test; n = 4), an
effect not observed in the hippocampus (p = 0.8, student’s t test; n
= 4) or the frontal cortex (p = 0.4, student’s t test; n = 4) (data not
shown). the ability of  xxxd429xxx  to enhance creb phosphorylation was blocked by co-administration of rimcazole (p > 0.05,
bonferroni’s, post-hoc test; n = 3) (figure 2(a) and (b)) but, significantly, co-administration of ritanserin also blocked the increase in
creb phosphorylation (p > 0.05, bonferroni’s, post-hoc test; n =
3) and the expected summation by both  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists was not observed (figure 2(c) and (d)). such an effect has
been observed previously in the hippocampus but not in the hypothalamus (ladurelle et al., 2012).

immunolocalisation of  xxxd429xxx 
signalling pathways
the ability of  xxxd429xxx  to induce bdnf protein expression
through both  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism and sigma-1 receptor
agonism implied the possibility of a common pathway or two
separate signalling mechanisms. this was further investigated
using immunocytochemistry to resolve the cellular location of
both receptors in the pvn of the hypothalamus. sigma-1 receptor
immunostaining gave the appearance of being specifically associated with dendrite-like structures (figure 3(b)), as has been previously reported for the neuronal subcellular localisation of this
receptor (alonso et al., 2000). in contrast,  xxxg1115xxx  immunoreactivity was associated with the perinuclear area of cells

cells immunopositive for crf showed a similar distribution to

including the localisation of the immunostaining to the perinuclear region (figure 3(d)). dual labelling of the crf immunopositive cells with those expressing the  xxxg1115xxx  demonstrated
both to be co-localised (figure 4(a) and (b)), as has been reported
in previous studies (heisler et al., 2007). no such co-localisation
was observed between  xxxg1115xxx  and sigma-1 receptor
immunoreactivities (figure 4(c) and (d)) as these two populations
of cells were separate and located to different regions of the pvn.

expression of synapsin and  xxxg642xxx , which are pre- and post-synaptic markers of structural neuroplasticity.  xxxd429xxx  was
found to significantly increase the expression of hypothalamic
synapsin (p = 0.001, student’s t test; n = 4) but had no effect on
 xxxg642xxx  expression (p = 0.63, student’s t test; n = 6) (figure 5(a)
and (b)). given that  xxxd429xxx  was without effect on bdnf
expression in the hippocampus or frontal cortex, we also determined its effect on synapsin and  xxxg642xxx  expression in these brain
regions.  xxxd429xxx  was found to have no effect on the expression of either synapsin (p = 0.61, student’s t test; n = 4) or  xxxg642xxx 
(p = 0.13, student’s t test; n = 6) expression in the hippocampus or
the frontal cortex.

modulation of hypothalamic synapsin and
 xxxg642xxx  by  xxxd429xxx 

in this study we have presented findings that support a dual mechanism by which  xxxd429xxx  induces hypothalamic bdnf through
the synergistic action of  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism and activation
of the sigma-1 receptor (see figure 6). individually sigma-1 receptor agonism and  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism have been separately
shown to induce bdnf expression within the hippocampus and
frontal cortex (kikuchi-utsumi and nakaki, 2008; ladurelle et al.,

the ability of  xxxd429xxx  to enhance bdnf protein expression
also implies the potential of this putative antidepressant to induce
long-term structural modifications within the hypothalamus. this
idea was explored by analysing the effect of  xxxd429xxx  on the

2012). however, the combined  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism and
sigma-1 receptor agonism provided by  xxxd429xxx  appears to
exert a brain region-specific effect on hypothalamic bdnf expression which may relate to its modulation of activity within the hpa
axis. the brain region-specific effect of  xxxd429xxx  in the hypothalamus is consistent with its antagonism of the  xxxg1115xxx 
as activation of this receptor on the crf neurons in the pvn of the
hypothalamus is known to result in increased crf expression
(heisler et al., 2007). furthermore, the antagonistic action of  xxxd429xxx  at the 5-ht2c receptors in the pvn may also account for
its ability to modulate bdnf as crf can negatively regulate
bdnf expression (smith et al., 1995).

 xxxd429xxx  regulates creb phosphorylation
in the hypothalamus
the bdnf gene contains a creb regulatory element (cre) in its
promoter region and its transcription is regulated by creb (conti
et al., 2002; tabuchi et al., 2002). antidepressants that increase
bdnf expression also increase creb phosphorylation (alboni
et al., 2010; nibuya et al., 1995) and, in keeping with this general
observation,  xxxd429xxx  was found to induce hypothalamic
creb phosphorylation thereby suggesting a role for creb in
mediating its brain region-specific transcription of bdnf. the
effect was also consistent with  xxxd429xxx  activating the
sigma-1 receptor as its antagonist rimcazole inhibited creb
phosphorylation. thus  xxxd429xxx  by activating the sigma-1
receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum results in mobilisation of

calcium (hayashi and su, 2007) and the activation of calcium
calmodulin kinases ( xxxg329xxx   xxxg330xxx ) that leads to creb phosphorylation
(moriguchi et al., 2011).
 xxxd429xxx -induced creb phosphorylation was inhibited
by the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist ritanserin. this effect was unexpected as the  xxxg1115xxx  is a gq protein-coupled receptor
which when activated increases calcium mobilisation via inositol
trisphosphate (ip3) production (backstrom et al., 1999; hannon
and hoyer, 2008). hence inhibition of the  xxxg1115xxx  should
lead to reduced calcium mobilisation and an attenuation of creb
phosphorylation. these opposing effects of  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonism and sigma-1 receptor agonism on hypothalamic
creb phosphorylation suggested a divergence in signalling pathways employed by  xxxd429xxx  and predicted the existence of
distinct populations of cells separately expressing the 5-ht2c and
sigma-1 receptors. consistent with previous studies, we could
demonstrate the  xxxg1115xxx  to be located on crf containing
neurons in the pvn of the hypothalamus where its activation is
known to induce crf expression via creb-mediated transcription through the cre in the crf gene promoter (heisler et al.,
2007; mayr and montminy, 2001; yao et al., 2007). it is likely,
therefore, that  xxxd429xxx  inhibits crf expression via 5-ht2c
receptor inhibition and subsequent reduction in creb phosphorylation. this is further supported by the fact that the  xxxd429xxx -induced reduction in crf expression was not reversed by
the sigma-1 receptor antagonist rimcazole.
in addition to directly increasing hypothalamic bdnf expression through activation of the sigma-1 receptor,  xxxd429xxx

may also indirectly increase its expression through inhibition of
crf expression. this is part suggested by the observation that
the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist ritanserin potentiates  xxxd429xxx -induced bdnf expression and also the substantial evidence that elevated levels of stress hormones significantly reduce
bdnf expression (grønli et al., 2006; murakami et al., 2005;
smith et al., 1995).

influence of  xxxd429xxx  on hypothalamic
plasticity
the ability of  xxxd429xxx  to increase the expression of hypothalamic bdnf also implies it may significantly enhance synaptic
plasticity within this brain region. in in vitro studies, for example,
bdnf has been shown to increase hippocampal dendritic spine
number and length and the expression of synaptic proteins such as
 xxxg642xxx , synapsin,  xxxg2182xxx  ( xxxg2182xxx ), synaptogamin and  xxxg2236xxx  (kumamaru et al., 2008;
liao et al., 2007; tartaglia et al., 2001). the effects of bdnf on
synaptic protein expression in vitro are similar to those observed
following antidepressant treatment in vivo (chen et al., 2008,

2010; o’leary et al., 2009), indicating that they may be mediated
by increased bdnf expression and that this effect may be a characteristic of clinically effective antidepressants.
consistent with these ideas we found chronic  xxxd429xxx 
treatment to significantly increase protein expression of the synapsin synaptic marker within the hypothalamus but not in the hippocampus or frontal cortex. unexpectedly,  xxxd429xxx  had no
effect on the postsynaptic marker  xxxg642xxx  in any brain region
examined, suggesting it unlikely to increase hypothalamic synaptic
complement. this, nevertheless, remains consistent with the therapeutic potential of  xxxd429xxx  as post-mortem studies of patients
with depression have not shown hypothalamic atrophy (cotter
et al., 2002; rajkowska et al., 1999; stockmeier et al., 2004).
that  xxxd429xxx  significantly increases hypothalamic synapsin expression suggests it is more likely to modulate existing
synapse plasticity. synapsins play a crucial role in tethering synaptic vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle docking in pre-existing synapses and the promotion
of activity between synapses and synaptic stabilisation (cesca
et al., 2010). the  xxxd429xxx -induced increases in synapsin
expression are likely mediated by bdnf signalling as these are
observed only in the hypothalamus. furthermore, there is

substantial evidence to suggest bdnf, which is released from
the postsynaptic element, preferentially affects trkb receptors
on the pre-synapse and induces an increase in the number of
docking vesicles (cohen-cory et al., 2010; pozzo-miller et al.,
1999; tyler et al., 2006).

conclusion
this study delineates mechanisms by which  xxxd429xxx  induces
bdnf expression in the hypothalamus and demonstrates its
capacity to induce changes in synaptic plasticity within the hypothalamus. these findings may contribute to explaining the significant ability of  xxxd429xxx  to ameliorate stress-induced anhedonia
(ring et al., 2013). the prominence of anhedonia and reduced
motivation in depression highlights their importance in its symptomatology and may even suggest an involvement in its pathophysiology and etiology (nestler and carlezon, 2006). further,
disinhibition of the hpa axis, as in  xxxg1601xxx -heterozygous mutant mice (gr+/–), is associated with depressive
behaviours, a dysregulation of serotoninergic neurotransmission
and a reduction in bdnf expression (ridder et al., 2005; schulteherbrüggen et al., 2007). thus the specific actions of  xxxd429xxx  on the hpa axis may provide a fundamentally new
mechanism to enable the development of antidepressant medications for the treatment of specific subtypes of depression that are
dominated by states of anhedonia.
