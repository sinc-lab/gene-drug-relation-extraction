effects of  xxxd2688xxx  on prostanoid
biosynthesis in humans
bac&s~nd:
the active metabolite
of the anti-inflammatory
drug  xxxd2688xxx 
has been characterized
as
a selective inhibitor
of the inducible
prostaglandin
h synthase (pghs).
the aim of this study was to
investigate the rate of eicosanoid biosynthesis
after oral dosing with  xxxd2688xxx 
in nine healthy subjects.
methods: we measured
the urinary
excretion
of products
of platelet (11-dehydro-thromboxane
b,
[txb,])
and renal (prostaglandin
lfj,, [pgf,,])
 xxxd208xxx 
metabolism
as in vivo indexes of the constitutive  xxxg1883xxx 
pathway. moreover,
the production
of txb, during whole blood clotting was assessed as an index of the cyclooxygenase
activity of platelet  xxxg1883xxx 
ex vivo.
results: at steady state,  xxxd2688xxx 
(500 and 1000 mg daily for 7 days) was associated with statistically
significant
dose-dependent
reduction
in the urinary
excretion of 11-dehydro-txb,
and serum txb,
levels by approximately
50% to 70%. however, the drug did not significantly
affect the urinary excretion
of pgf,,. after discontinuation
of  xxxd2688xxx ,
urinary
11-dehydro-txb,
excretion and whole blood
txb, production
returned
to predrug
levels with a similar timecourse
that was consistent with the
elimination
half-life of its active metabolite.
the daily administration
of low-dose aspirin (40 mg), a
selective inhibitor
of platelet  xxxg1883xxx ,
caused a cumulative
inhibition
of urinary 11-dehydro-txb,
and
whole blood txb, production
that recovered with a timecourse consistent with platelet turnover.
concl~ssions:  xxxd2688xxx 
does dose-dependently
inhibit the cyclooxygenase
activity of platelet  xxxg1883xxx 
of healthy subjects both in vivo and ex vivo. thus it is unlikely that its safety profile in patients may be
related to selective inhibition
of the inducible
 xxxg1884xxx .

 xxxd2688xxx  is a nonacidic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) with an unusual pharmacologic profile.’ after absorption, it is converted in the
liver to the active metabolite 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl
acetic acid (6-mna).2 6-mna reaches maximum
plasma concentrations within 2 to 4 hours. its elimination half-life is approximately 24 hours. 6-mna is hepatically, not renally, cleared from the circulation. it
does not undergo enterohepatic recirculation. 6-mna

(6-hydroxy-2- xxxd1338xxx ), which is excreted
in the urine.3
studies in laboratory animals have shown that  xxxd2688xxx  is as effective an anti-inflammatory agent as
traditional nsaids.~ in clinical trials,  xxxd2688xxx 
was effective in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.5 the administration of
 xxxd2688xxx  was associated with less gastric and renal
adverse events than other nsaids.~
therapeutic effects and side effects of nsaids are
mainly the result of the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase
(pghs).7,8 pghs is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis
of prostanoids from  xxxd208xxx .’ recently it has
been shown that mammalian cells contain two related,
but unique, isozymes of pghs.”  xxxg1883xxx , constitutively expressed in most tissues” and blood monocytes and platelets, l2 is involved in the production of
prostanoids that participate in the local modulation of

physiologic processes, such as gastric cytoprotection.’
in contrast,  xxxg1884xxx  is an inducible enzyme that can
be expressed in inflamed tissuesi or after exposure to
growth factors.14 the two isozymes, though only 60%
homologous,15 have similar catalytic activities. however, they have been demonstrated to be pharmacologically distinct. l6 thus, the development of drugs
that specifically inhibit  xxxg1884xxx  could lead to a new
generation of nsaids with increased tolerability. l7
in cos-1 cells transfected with the plasmid expression constructs for murine  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx ,
6-mna was about a sevenfold better inhibitor of the
inducible enzyme,16 and it was suggested that this biochemical selectivity might contribute to the safety profile of  xxxd2688xxx . l8 however, when tested in a human whole blood model of  xxxg1884xxx  expression,
6-mna was equally potent in inhibiting the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet  xxxg1883xxx  and monocyte
 xxxg1884xxx .19 because of such apparent discrepancy in
the alleged biochemical selectivity of 6-mna, we set
out to investigate the rate of eicosanoid biosynthesis
after oral dosing of  xxxd2688xxx  in healthy human subjects. we measured the urinary excretion of products
of platelet and renal  xxxd208xxx  metabolism as in
vivo indexes of the constitutive pghs pathway.

material and methods
study design. nine healthy volunteers (three
women and six men; age, 37 ? 9 years; weight, 65 +9 kg, mean +- sd) who gave informed consent to participating in the study received 1000 mg oral  xxxd2688xxx  ( xxxd2688xxx , smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals,
worthing, england) daily for 7 consecutive days. peripheral venous blood samples were obtained on 4
successive days before and after the first and seventh
administration of  xxxd2688xxx . eight-hour (11 pm to 7
am) urine samples were collected on 4 successive days
before and after the first, third, fifth, and seventh administration of  xxxd2688xxx . venous blood samples
were drawn 12 hours after dosing, whereas urine collection started at the time of  xxxd2688xxx  administration. none of the subjects had taken aspirin or other
aspirin-like drugs in the two-week period before the
study.
to assess the contribution of platelet  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition to the reduction in thromboxane (tx) metabolite excretion during oral dosing with  xxxd2688xxx , we
compared the effects of varying degrees of platelet
txa, suppression achieved by  xxxd2688xxx  with those
obtained with a low-dose aspirin regimen. thus, on

two consecutive regimens of 500 and 1000 mg
 xxxd2688xxx  daily, each administered for 1 week;
s-hour urine and peripheral venous blood samples
were obtained on 3 successive days before and after
the first, third, and seventh administration and on 3

successive days before and every day during aspirin
administration and on the first, third, seventh, and
fourteenth days after the drug was discontinued.
whole blood samples were drawn by venipuncture
from an antecubital vein and 1 ml aliquots were immediately transferred into glass tubes and allowed to
clot at 37” c for 60 minutes. serum was separated by
centrifugation (10 minutes at 2000 rpm) and kept at
-30” c until assayed for txb,. whole blood txb,
and pgf,, production was measured as a reflection of
maximally stimulated cyclooxygenase activity of
platelet  xxxg1883xxx  by endogenously formed thrombin.20
eight-hour urine samples were obtained for measurement of the urinary excretion of ll-dehydrotxb,, a major enzymatic metabolite of txb,, as a reflection of the basal rate of production of txa, in
viva? moreover, we evaluated the effects of daily
dosing with 1000 mg  xxxd2688xxx  for 7 days on the
urinary excretion of pgf,,, an index of the cyclooxygenase activity of renal  xxxg1883xxx .22

added to 10 ml urine samples for recovery evaluation.
after adjusting the urine ph to 4.0 with  xxxd2154xxx ,
11-dehydro-txb, and pgf,, were extracted on seppak c,, cartridges (waters chromatography division,
millipore, milford, mass.) and eluted with ethyl acetate. the eluates were subjected to silicic acid column chromatography and further eluted with benzene/

to compare the dose- and time-dependent inhibition
by  xxxd2688xxx  of txaz production evaluated ex vivo
and in vivo, the generation of txb, in whole blood
and the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-txb, were
assessed in three healthy volunteers before and after
the first, third, and seventh doses of  xxxd2688xxx  500
and 1000 mg and after drug withdrawal. before  xxxd2688xxx  administration, serum txb, levels averaged
414 + 37 rig/ml (mean 2 sd, y1= 6) on two separate
occasions. daily dosing with 500 mg was associated
with 48% -t 7%, 58% + 3%, and 51% + 5%
(mean f sd, n = 3, p < 0.01 versus control) reduction after the first, third, and seventh doses, respectively (fig. 3). after the first, third, and seventh doses
of 1000 mg  xxxd2688xxx , whole blood txb, production was reduced by 62% 2 lo%, 70% (n = 2), and
70% +- 4%, respectively (p < 0.01 versus control;

efficient of variation of 20% + 14%. metabolite excretion was reduced by oral dosing with 500 and 1000
mg  xxxd2688xxx  in a dose- and tune-dependent fashion
(fig. 3). after the first, third, and seventh doses of 500

42% -s lo%, and 46% + 23% (mean t sd, n = 3,

a similar approach was used to investigate the relationship between cumulative suppression of platelet
cyclooxygenase activity and inhibition of txa, biosynthesis in vivo, such as that achieved with low-dose
aspirin in the same three healthy subjects. as shown in

was discontinued, whole blood txb, production and
11-dehydro-txb, excretion slowly returned toward
predrug levels, with a timecourse consistent with
platelet lifespan (8 to 10 days; fig. 4). a highly significant correlation was found between the percentage
inhibition of serum txb, and urinary ll-dehydrotxb,, both after  xxxd2688xxx  (v = 0.569, n = 30, p =
0.001) and low-dose aspirin (r = 0.676, n = 23, p =
0.0001).

discussion
the results of this study show time- and dosedependent inhibition of the cyclooxygenase activity of
the constitutive platelet pgh synthase, as assessed ex
vivo, and of total body txa, biosynthesis, as assessed
in vivo, by short-term treatment with  xxxd2688xxx  in
healthy subjects. the similar suppression of two products of  xxxd208xxx  cyclooxygenation (i.e., txb, and
pgf,,) is consistent with the active metabolite of

 xxxd2688xxx , 6-mna, being a relatively weak cynclooxygenaseinhibitor. i6 the partial dissociation of the
ex vivo (serum txb,) and in vivo (urinary lldehydro-txb,) effects of the first dose of  xxxd2688xxx 
is likely to reflect its time-dependent conversion to
6-mna, inasmuch as the first blood sample was drawn
12 hours after dosing and the first 8-hour urine collection started at the time of  xxxd2688xxx  administration.
after steady state was reached, comparable reduction of
both indexes of txa, biosynthesis was found. the extent of suppression of eicosanoid biosynthesis measured after 7 days of oral dosing with 1000 mg  xxxd2688xxx  is consistent with the expected plasma levels of
6-mnaz4 and with its ic,, (inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition) value for inhibition of human platelet cyclooxygenase activity in vitro.” thus a
mean steady-state plasma 6-mna concentration of 40 to
50 kg/ml was reached after the administration of 1 gram
daily of  xxxd2688xxx , and the ic,, value for inhibition of
platelet txb, production was 52 t 9 bg/m1.19
at variance with the effects on platelet cyclooxygenase activity, the administration of therapeutic doses
of  xxxd2688xxx  to healthy subjects did not significantly

fig. 4. effects of low-dose aspirin on txa, production in vivo and ex vivo. aspirin, 40 mg, was
administered daily for 5 days to three healthy subjects. the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-txb,

with aspirin. measurements are expressed as percentages of the predosing control values and reported as mean values 2 sd.

alter the urinary excretion of pgf,,, an index of renal
prostaglandin
biosynthesis.”
this finding confirms a

similar observation made by giamressi et a1.,25 who
reported that the daily oral administration of 1000 mg
 xxxd2688xxx  for 2 weeks did not significantly affect
urinary pge, and 6-keto-pgf,, excretion in 12 patients with arthritis. although we cannot exclude differential sensitivity of platelet and renal  xxxg1883xxx  to
6-mna, a more likely explanation for the above finding is related to the negligible renal clearance of
6-mna in humans.3
the comparative assessment of the relationship
between inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity
and reduction in thromboxane metabolite excretion,
carried out with two consecutive doses of  xxxd2688xxx 
and a low-dose aspirin regimen in the same subjects,
strongly suggests that the effect of therapeutic doses
of  xxxd2688xxx  on the basal rate of txa, biosynthesis
in healthy subjects can be largely accounted for by
reversible

inhibition

of the cyclooxygenase

activity

of

platelet  xxxg1883xxx  by 6-mna. to explore such a
relationship over varying degrees of enzyme inhibition, we therefore measured serum txb, levels and
urinary 11-dehydro-txb, excretion six times during
increasing and three times during decreasing plasma
levels of 6-mna, respectively. the same indexes

were measured five times during cumulative inhibition and four times during recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase activity after low-dose aspirin. the cumulative suppression of the platelet biosynthetic
capacity and total body txa, biosynthesis during
daily dosing with 40 mg aspirin and the slow pattern
of time-dependent return of these indexes toward
control levels after aspirin withdrawal confirm earlier
findings that suggested that urinary 11-dehydro-txb,
excretion is largely a reflection of platelet txa,
production.26 similar results were obtained during and
after dosing with  xxxd2688xxx , although we could not
explore such relationship beyond the 70% level of
inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity because
6-mna is a relatively weak inhibitor of platelet
 xxxg1883xxx .19
overall, the results of this study, which show a
measurable impact of therapeutic doses of  xxxd2688xxx 
on constitutive eicosanoid biosynthesis of healthy subjects, make it unlikely that its safety profile in patients
may be related to a selective inhibition’of the inducible pgh-synthase 2, as suggested by meade et a1.16
alternative explanations related to its metabolism and
tissue distribution and clearance of its active metabolite are perhaps more likely and should be investigated
further.
