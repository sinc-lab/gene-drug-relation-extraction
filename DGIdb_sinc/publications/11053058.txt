abstract
 xxxd2450xxx  is a selective inhibitor of de
novo pyrimidine synthesis. in phase ii and
iii clinical trials of active rheumatoid
arthritis,  xxxd2450xxx  was shown to improve primary and secondary outcome
measures with a satisfactory safety profile. the  xxxd3316xxx ,
a77 1726, at low, therapeutically applicable doses, reversibly inhibits  xxxg633xxx  ( xxxg633xxx ), the
rate limiting step in the de novo synthesis
of pyrimidines. unlike other cells, activated lymphocytes expand their pyrimidine pool by approximately eightfold
during proliferation; purine pools are
increased only twofold. to meet this
demand, lymphocytes must use both salvage and de novo synthesis pathways.
thus the inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  by
a77 1726 prevents lymphocytes from accumulating suycient pyrimidines to support dna synthesis. at higher doses,
a77 1726 inhibits tyrosine kinases responsible for early t cell and b cell signalling
in the g0/g1 phase of the cell cycle.
because the immunoregulatory evects of
a77 1726 occur at doses that inhibit
 xxxg633xxx  but not tyrosine kinases, the
interruption of de novo pyrimidine synthesis may be the primary mode of action.
recent evidence suggests that the observed anti-inflammatory evects of
a77 1726 may relate to its ability to
suppress interleukin 1 and  xxxg2296xxx  á selectively over their inhibitors
in t lymphocyte/monocyte contact activation. a77 1726 has also been shown to suppress the activation of nuclear factor êb, a
potent mediator of inflammation when
stimulated by inflammatory agents. continuing research indicates that a77 1726

may downregulate the glycosylation of
adhesion molecules, evectively reducing
cell-cell contact activation during inflammation.
(ann rheum dis 2000;59:841–849)

although the pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) remain elusive, advances
in both molecular biology and clinical research
have identified a unique orchestration of immune system cell subsets, cell surface markers,
and soluble cell products that have a role in the
process of inflammation associated with ra.
inflammation and subsequent degradation of
the synovial tissue are initiated by the influx of
lymphocytes (b cells, cd4+, and cd8+
t cells) into the synovial tissue. in the simplest
model, cd4+ t lymphocytes are activated by
antigens in the joint and stimulate plasma cells,
mast cells, macrophages, and synovial fibroblasts to produce inflammatory mediators ( xxxg2296xxx  á (tnfá) and interleukin
1 ( xxxg1169xxx )), which stimulate matrix degradation.1–3
refining our knowledge of the immunoregulatory function of the various t cell subsets, as
well as knowledge of the evects of macrophages
and monocytes at the site of inflammation, may
lead to the development of evective and targeted
treatments for ra.
the t cell activation associated with ra has
focused much attention on identifying drugs
that regulate t cell progression through the cell
cycle in an attempt to modulate proliferation.4 5
one such agent,  xxxd2450xxx  (n-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)- 5 - methylisoxazol - 4 - carboxamide), is a low molecular weight (270),
synthetic isoxazol derivative. interest in  xxxd2450xxx  as an antirheumatic drug is due to its
unique ability to regulate progression through
the cell cycle by inhibiting de novo pyrimidine
ribonucleotide biosynthesis.6–17

to be classified as a disease modifying
antirheumatic drug (dmard), a pharmaceutical agent must show eycacy and safety,
as well as the ability to slow the progression
of ra.  xxxd2450xxx  (active metabolite
a77 1726) is a unique dmard with immunomodulatory properties. evective treatment for
ra requires a thorough knowledge of the mode
of action of the therapeutic regimen chosen. in
addition, with the current interest in combination treatment, the specific interaction between
agents must be considered. therefore, the
purpose of this review is to describe the
immunomodulatory actions of  xxxd2450xxx  in
the treatment of ra at the cellular and
molecular levels. in addition, the evects of
combination treatment will be considered.
 xxxd2450xxx  chemistry and metabolism
 xxxd2450xxx  is a prodrug that is rapidly
converted in the gastrointestinal tract and
plasma to its active, open ring metabolite,
the  xxxd3316xxx , a77 1726 (2- cyano3-hydroxy-n-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl) butenamide) (fig 1). structure-activity studies have
shown how modifications to a77 1726 avect
its immunoregulatory activity.10 18 19 in general,

4-trifluoromethyl group of the aromatic ring
was replaced by more lipophilic groups.
replacement of the aromatic ring by straight
chain carbon groups decreased drug eycacy.
a phase ii clinical trial with patients with ra
showed that a77 1726 was highly bound to
plasma protein (>99%) and had a half life of
between 15 and 18 days. the total plasma
clearance was 0.3 ml/kg/h.20 a somewhat
shorter half life of about 11 days was reported
in studies of healthy subjects.21 the majority of
a77 1726 (60% to 70%) is eventually metabolised into trifluoromethylaniline-oxanilic acid
and excreted in the urine.
a77 1726 regulates lymphocyte
proliferation
a77 1726 has been shown to prevent skin,
heart, and kidney graft rejection in animal
models.22–24  xxxd2450xxx  is also evective in
various experimental models of autoimmune
diseases, including a spontaneous syndrome in
mrl/lpr mice that resembles human systemic
lupus erythematosus,25 an anti-acetylcholine
receptor induced model of myasthenia gravis in
rats,26 and a t cell mediated allergic encephalomyelitis, which models human multiple sclerosis.27 more important for its role as an
antirheumatic drug is the demonstration that
 xxxd2450xxx  is highly evective in the treatment
of animal models of both adjuvant28–31 and collagen induced arthritis.19
a77 1726 has been shown to regulate lymphocyte proliferation both in vitro7 9 12 13 32–36 and
in vivo.14 31 36 37 in in vitro studies, a77 1726 is an
equally evective immunoregulator of t cell proliferation when stimulated by cell surface receptor mediated mitogens or by mitogens, such as
 xxxd2925xxx  plus  xxxd2379xxx , which bypass initial signal transduction events.9 12 34 t cell
dependent b cell formation of autoantibodies,
including iga and igg isotypes, is also inhibited
by a77 1726.13 the dose of a77 1726 needed to
modulate lymphocyte proliferation can vary
greatly between species.12 34 in an in vitro study
comparing proliferation of rat, mouse, and
human lymphocytes, the mean 50% inhibitory
concentrations (ic50 ) for a77 1726 were 0.09,
3.5, and 12.5 µmol/l, respectively.34 these ic50
values were similar for both receptor and
non-receptor mediated (that is,  xxxd2925xxx 
plus  xxxd2379xxx ) stimulation.
although the immunoregulatory properties
of a77 1726 have been well documented, we
have only recently begun to understand the
molecular targets and biochemical mechanism(s) of action underlying these evects.
using flow cytometric analysis of mitogen
stimulated t cells, cherwinski et al showed
that a77 1726 prevented the cells from entering the dna replication phase (s phase) of the
cell cycle34 (see also siemasko et al,13 lang et
al,37 and herrmann m, frangou cg, kirschbaum b. cell cycle control of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor  xxxd2450xxx  through
the p53 and p21waf-1 pathways. paper presented
at the association of rheumatology health
professionals 32nd national scientific meeting; 8–12 november 1997; washington, dc).
as illustrated in fig 2, a77 1726 may prevent

843

 xxxd2450xxx  in the treatment of ra

cell progression into the s phase by acting at
several sites in the g0 (resting) or g1 (growth)
phases, or both. currently, two specific mechanisms of action for a77 1726 have been identified: (a) inhibition of tyrosine kinases associated with the initial stage of signal transduction
in g0, and (b) inhibition of de novo pyrimidine
nucleotide biosynthesis in late g1. as will be
described below, the inhibition of de novo
pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis occurs at
lower doses of a77 1726 than does the inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity and is considered the primary mechanism of action.
inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity
interference with the initial signal transduction
events which play a part in t cell activation
would prevent the transition of cells from the
resting g0 phase to the g1 phase. several processes involved in signal transduction, including
the inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity, are
avected by high doses of a77 1726. in jurkat
t cells, the activities of the src related tyrosine
kinases  xxxg1306xxx  and p59fyn have been shown to
be inhibited by a77 1726.33 tyrosine phosphorylation of the chain of the cd3 complex,
mediated by p59fyn, is thought to be critical for
successful t cell antigen receptor/cd3 complex signalling. likewise,  xxxg1306xxx  mediated
phosphorylation of the phospholipase c isozyme ã1 is important in the mobilisation of
intracellular ca2+. in another study a77 1726
was evective in inhibiting the levels of tyrosine
phosphorylated proteins in mouse leukaemia
cell line (lstra) cells, which overexpress
 xxxg1306xxx .11 a77 1726 was also reported to
suppress tyrosine phosphorylation in murine
ctll-4 cells stimulated by  xxxg1173xxx .33 a similar
inhibition of  xxxg1173xxx  receptor ( xxxg1174xxx ) associated
 xxxg2198xxx  activity has been seen in a
staphylococcal nuclease-specific t cell line.38
more recently, elder et al showed that
a77 1726 inhibited the phosphorylation of the
 xxxg1219xxx  and  xxxg1221xxx  tyrosine kinases, which are necessary for  xxxg1174xxx  signalling.14
other evects of a77 1726 on signal transduction have also been observed, but the data
are more equivocal. reductions in  xxxg1173xxx  production, possibly related to inhibition of  xxxg1306xxx ,
have been reported in a77 1726 treated
human t cells stimulated by  xxxd2676xxx  monoclonal antibodies.33 cao et al showed that
a77 1726 augments the immunosuppressive
cytokine tgfâ1 (transforming growth factor
â1), while simultaneously suppressing  xxxg1173xxx .39 in
contrast, another study failed to demonstrate
an evect of a77 1726 in  xxxg1173xxx  production.37 this
latter observation is further supported by data
demonstrating that exogenous  xxxg1173xxx  is unable to
antagonise the immunoregulatory evects of
a77 172639 (herrmann m, frangou cg,
kirschbaum b. cell cycle control of the de
novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor  xxxd2450xxx  through the p53 and p21waf-1 pathways.
paper presented at the association of rheumatology health professionals 32nd national scientific meeting; 8–12 november 1997; washington, dc). decreased  xxxg1174xxx  expression has
also been invoked as a potential mechanism of
action of a77 1726.6 33 however, concentra-

www.annrheumdis.com

tions of a77 1726 which inhibit lymphocyte
proliferation are not suycient to reduce  xxxg1174xxx 
expression.9 34 37 furthermore, many of the
reported evects of a77 1726 on signal transduction might be secondary results of a
primary mode of action (that is,  xxxg633xxx  inhibition).
recent evidence suggests that a77 1726 is a
potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-êb (nf-êb)
activation.40 nf-êb is a transcriptional factor
critical to the function of cells in the immune
system, and it plays a part in inflammation.
manna and aggarwal showed that treatment of
human jurkat t cells with a77 1726, at a concentration of 5–10 µmol/l, blocks tnf mediated activation of nf-êb.41 the evect was not
constrained to tnf activation, as the stimulating evects of other inflammatory agents were
also blocked. in contrast,  xxxg2198xxx  activity was suppressed at a concentration of
150 µmol/l.12 a77 1726 targeted the degradation of the inhibitory protein iêbá, which is
non-covalently associated with nf-êb in its
inactive state in the cytoplasm. inflammatory
agents induce the phosphorylation dependent
degradation of the inhibitory protein, which in
turn unmasks the nuclear localisation signals
on p65 and activates nf-êb. these observations indicate an additional biochemical
mechanism for the immunomodulatory evects
of a77 1726, as well as the observed antiinflammatory actions.
inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  is not the
principal target of a77 1726
several observations are incompatible with
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibition being the principal
mechanism underlying the immunoregulatory
action of a77 1726. a77 1726 is equally evective in inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation,
whether it is stimulated through a cell surface
receptor involving tyrosine kinases or by
mechanisms that bypass these initial signal
transduction events.13 34 it is also interesting to
note that the ability of a77 1726 to inhibit
proliferation was the same, whether it was
added at the time of stimulation, eight hours
later,34 or even up to 24 hours later.13 the
drug’s ability to avect proliferation, independently of time, questions the role of tyrosine
kinase inhibition early in the signal transduction.
comparison of the ic50 values for the
regulation of lymphocyte proliferation versus
inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity also
suggests that early signalling events are not the
principal target of a77 1726. a discrepancy
between the ic50 values for a77 1726 mediated
inhibition of proliferation and  xxxg2198xxx 
activity has been shown in the murine cytotoxic
t cell line ctll-4. the ic50 for inhibition of
proliferation was 2 µmol/l, whereas that for
 xxxg2198xxx  mediated phosphorylation of
 xxxg1219xxx  and  xxxg1221xxx  kinases was 50 µmol/l.14
inhibition of de novo pyrimidine
synthesis
during proliferation the pyrimidine nucleotide
pool within lymphocytes must expand by
approximately eightfold.42 in contrast, the

844

breedveld, dayer

purine nucleotide pool increases by only
twofold.42 although salvage pathways for obtaining pyrimidines exist, hereditary disorders
of nucleotide metabolism suggest that highly
proliferating cells such as lymphocytes need
both de novo and salvage pathways to match
the greatly increased demand for pyrimidine
nucleotides during proliferation.42
three independent reports appeared in
1995 suggesting that a77 1726 is a reversible
inhibitor of pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis
in vitro.6–8 zielinski et al showed that exogenous
application of the pyrimidine nucleotide, uridine, could reverse the antiproliferative action of
a77 1726 in murine b and t cell lines studied
in vitro.6 in another study cherwinski et al
tested the ability of both pyrimidine and purine
nucleotides to antagonise the antiproliferative
actions of a77 1726 in several cell lines,
including rat pheochromocytoma ach2 cells,
human jurkat t cells, mouse b cell lymphoma
a20–1.11 cells, and mouse b cell hybridoma
3do-18.3 cells.7 the antiproliferative evect of
5 µm a77 1726 on all of these cell lines was
completely blocked by 100 µm uridine. cytidine, which can be converted to uridine by
 xxxg400xxx ,43 also restored proliferation but with a reduced eycacy. the purine
nucleotides, adenosine and guanosine, had no
evect on the antiproliferative actions of
a77 1726. similar results were observed in
mitogen stimulated normal rat, mouse, and
human lymphocytes.
using human jurkat t cells, cao et al found
that uridine and cytidine (at concentrations of
up to 4 µmol/l) were equally successful in
reversing the immunoregulatory evects of
a77 1726.9 this was true for concentrations of
a77 1726 up to 24 µmol/l. at higher concentrations of a77 1726, uridine and cytidine were
only partially successful in restoring proliferation. presumably,  xxxg2198xxx  activity was
being inhibited at these higher concentrations
of a77 1726. it is interesting to note that uridine was found to be evective in restoring
proliferation when added to cell cultures up to
24 hours after the initial treatment with
a77 1726.9
subsequent studies have confirmed and
extended the close association between the
immunoregulatory actions of a77 1726 and
altered pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis,
both in vitro8 10–15 44 and in vivo.10 16 17 44
changes in intracellular nucleotide pools
caused by exposure to a77 1726 have also
been measured.7 in human t lymphoblastoma
ccrf.cem cells, 10 µm a77 1726 decreased
 xxxd3475xxx  (utp) and cytidine
triphosphate (ctp) levels by 58% and 51%,
respectively. in normal rat spleen cells stimulated with  xxxd2620xxx  (con a), 1 µm
a77 1726 decreased utp levels by 34% and
ctp levels by 18%. at these doses of
a77 1726 neither  xxxd83xxx 
(atp) nor  xxxd2247xxx  (gtp) levels were avected. in  xxxg1173xxx  stimulated murine
t cells, 10 µm a77 1726 has been shown to
decrease utp levels by 95% and ctp levels by
85% without avecting either atp or gtp levels.14 in the murine lstra cell line, a77 1726

www.annrheumdis.com

selectively inhibits utp and ctp synthesis with
an ic50 of 10 µmol/l, which is similar to the ic50
for its antiproliferative activity (10–30 µmol/l).11
these results indicate that a77 1726 inhibits
de novo pyrimidine synthesis.
a77 1726 is a non-competitive inhibitor of
 xxxg633xxx 
a77 1726 could inhibit de novo pyrimidine
nucleotide biosynthesis at several sites. there
are six steps in the biosynthesis of uridine-5’monophosphate (ump) from atp and
glutamine. the enzymes which catalyse these
steps are carbamyl phosphate synthetase ii
(cpsii),  xxxd233xxx  transcarboxylase (atcase), l- xxxg319xxx  (dhoase), l- xxxg633xxx  ( xxxg633xxx ),  xxxd2794xxx 
phosphoribosyl transferase ( xxxg2388xxx ), and
orotidine-5’-monophosphate
decarboxylase
(ompdc). the first three enzymes in this
pathway form a cytosolic multienzyme complex, cpsii-atcase-dhoase. because of
their close association within this complex,
enzymatic products are transferred eyciently
from one active site to the next with minimum
losses due to divusion into the adjacent intracellular space. the fourth enzymatic step, catalysed by  xxxg633xxx , occurs on the outer face of
the inner mitochondrial membrane. finally,
the last two enzymes in the pathway form
another cytosolic multienzyme complex,
 xxxg2388xxx -ompdc.
the activities of all the enzymes in this pathway are allosterically controlled by the concentrations of both precursors and products.45 two
observations suggest, however, that the regulation of pyrimidine synthesis may be particularly sensitive to the catalytic step mediated by
 xxxg633xxx . firstly, lymphocytes have fewer
mitochondria than most cells.46 secondly, both
the precursor (dihydroorotate) and the product
( xxxd2794xxx ) of the  xxxg633xxx  mediated step must
divuse across the mitochondrial membrane.
these two factors place  xxxg633xxx  at a strategic
position to act as a key step in regulating the de
novo synthesis of ump. consistent with this
hypothesis, it has been shown that dihydroorotate accumulates in human t lymphoblastoid cells treated with a77 1726,8 while exogenous  xxxd2794xxx  antagonises the evect of
a77 1726.44
other studies have shown directly the selective inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  by a77 1726. the
evects of a77 1726 on the six diverent
enzymes in the de novo ump synthetic
pathway were examined using a human t lymphoblastoma cell line.47  xxxg633xxx  was shown
to be reversibly inhibited with a ki value of
about 3 µmol/l. no other cytosolic enzymes in
this biosynthetic pathway were avected. in
another study the in vivo ability of a number of
synthetic a77 1726 analogues to inhibit
delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in rats
and mice was found to be closely correlated
with their in vitro ability to inhibit  xxxg633xxx 
activity.19 the inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  by
a77 1726 has been confirmed in a number
of subsequent in vitro studies.10 16 19 48 a
consistent finding in all of these studies was
that a77 1726 inhibited  xxxg633xxx  at drug

concentrations similar to those resulting in its
immunoregulatory evects, and at one to three
orders of magnitude less than that needed for
the inhibition of tyrosine kinases.
 xxxg633xxx  requires two substrates for catalysis. in addition to dihydroorotate, which is
converted to  xxxd2794xxx , ubiquinone is used as an
electron acceptor. in recombinant human
 xxxg633xxx , it has been shown that a77 1726
inhibits the binding sites for both these
substrates non-competitively.48 in a study analysing the kinetics of  xxxg633xxx  inhibition, it
was found that a77 1726 acted as a competitive inhibitor of the ubiquinone binding site
and a non-competitive inhibitor of the dihydroorotate binding site.48 these actions of
a77 1726 distinguish it from another inhibitor
of  xxxg633xxx ,  xxxd363xxx  sodium, which is a
non-competitive inhibitor of both the ubiquinone and dihydroorotate binding sites.49 figure

of  xxxg633xxx  on de novo synthesis of pyrimidine and on the subsequent activities of
activated lymphocytes.
a77 1726 decreases levels of rump
leading to cell cycle arrest in late g1
in regulating the phosphorylation state of
retinoblastoma protein (rb), the cyclin d/cdk
(cyclin dependent kinase) and e/cdk complexes serve as part of the g1 checkpoint, where
cells with low ribonucleotide levels and/or
damaged dna are selectively prevented from
progressing further into the cell cycle.50 other
components of the g1 checkpoint include a

www.annrheumdis.com

“sensor” to detect low ribonucleotide levels
(that is, reduced rump (ribonucleotide  xxxd870xxx ) due to inhibition of
 xxxg633xxx  through a77 1726) and damaged
dna, as well as an “evector” that inhibits the
cyclin d/cdk and e/cdk complexes when such
situations occur. the sensor function is accomplished by the tumour suppression protein,
p53, whose proto-oncogene is also upregulated
after a mitogenic stimulus.50–52
in dividing cells with adequate ribonucleotide levels, p53 is stabilised in the cytoplasm.50
in cells with low ribonucleotide levels, however, p53 is activated and translocates into the
nucleus. if damaged dna is detected, p53
induces the transcription of yet another regulatory gene, whose product is a 21 kilodalton
protein, p21.53 the p21 protein acts as the
evector for the g1 checkpoint. it inhibits the
activity of the cyclin d/cdk and e/cdk complexes, leading to the dephosphorylation of
rb.53 as a result, rb can rebind to the
transcription factor e2f/dp-1, and cause the
cell to become arrested in g1. herrmann et al
have shown in stimulated human peripheral t
lymphocytes that both p53 and p21 become
upregulated after exposure to a77 1726, resulting in the cells becoming arrested in late g1

by reducing atp dependent pools of utp,
udp-glu ( xxxd3474xxx ), and
ctp (fig 3), the subsequent expression of
udp sugars is inhibited, strongly influencing
the glycosylation of adhesion molecules. similarly, ctp lipids, which are essential for the
incorporation of mannose and fructose into
glycoproteins, as well as dolichol-linked intermediates through gdp sugar precursors, are
suppressed (fig 3). reduced gtp and gdp
sugars would avect both lectin binding and cell
surface topography, and as a result, would
restrict mitogenic processes. these observations provide a mechanism for the antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory actions
of a77 1726.

a77 1726 modulation of inflammation
and metalloproteinase induction
at the site of inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases, inflammatory cells and cells of
the native tissue are in close proximity, which
implies that a possible mechanism for cell
communication is through direct cell-cell contact in addition to soluble factors. in a series of
studies54–59 of cell-cell contact between t
lymphocytes and monocytes, it has been shown
that cell-cell contact induces the production of
both matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and
tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1).
in addition, direct contact causes the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines ( xxxg1169xxx  and
tnfá) and their inhibitors ( xxxg1169xxx  receptor
antagonist and tnf soluble receptor).60 it is
postulated that an imbalance between mmps
and timps and cytokines and their inhibitors
may lead to the matrix destruction characteristic of chronic inflammation and, in particular,
the matrix degradation associated with ra.
with these observations, deage et al evaluated the evect of the anti-inflammatory agents,
a77 1726 and dexamethasone, on the contact
activation of the monocytic cell line thp-1.60
t lymphocytes were stimulated with phorbol
 xxxd2681xxx  acetate and phytohaemagglutinin in
the presence of both drugs, and it was noted
that a77 1726 and dexamethasone inhibited
the ability of stimulated t cells to activate the
monocytic cells by 66%–97% and 43%–70%,
respectively. it was found that a77 1726
tended to favour the inhibition of proinflammatory and matrix destructive factors over that
of anti-inflammatory factors and mmp inhibitors (fig 4), thus potentially limiting matrix
destruction. the exact mechanism for this
evect remains to be determined. however, flow
cytometry indicates that surface molecules
(cd69 and cd11) of t lymphocytes that are,
in part, involved in cell-cell contact signalling
with monocytes, were not modulated by either
drug, indicating an alternative mechanism.
preliminary clinical data on the expression of
cell adhesion molecules (cams) and mmps in
synovial tissue from 39 patients in a prospective, double blind trial comparing  xxxd2450xxx 
and methotrexate, indicate that both treatments resulted in comparable reductions in
synovial inflammation and decreases in production of cams, and a decrease in the mmp/
timp-1 ratio after four months of treatment
(kraan mc, reece rj, barg ec, et al. an
explorative study of the changes in synovial tissue in patients with ra after treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx  or methotrexate. paper presented
at the 14th european league against rheumatism congress; 6–11 june 1999; glasgow,
scotland). results of the study indicate that
both methotrexate and a77 1726 showed
comparable clinical eycacy in reducing inflammation within the synovial tissue.
in addition to providing strong evidence
establishing that the primary mode of action of
a77 1726 is the inhibition of  xxxg633xxx , rückemann et al also found that a77 1726 (100
µmol/l) significantly depleted atp and gtp
pools,61 thus strongly avecting atp dependent
enzymes, which modulate the immune system.

 xxxd3255xxx  and methotrexate.62 63  xxxd2450xxx  was also shown to reduce the rate of
radiographically assessed disease progression
significantly compared with the group receiving placebo and to produce comparable rates of
progression compared with the groups receiving active treatment.62 63
the comparative two year trial of  xxxd2450xxx  versus methotrexate found both treatments comparable at two years in counts of
tender joints and patient global assessment of
disease activity. radiographic assessments of
disease progression at two years were also
comparable.64a
the most common adverse events associated
with  xxxd2450xxx  treatment were gastrointestinal, consisting primarily of diarrhoea, raised
liver function tests, abdominal pain, and
nausea/vomiting.20 62 63 the frequency and severity of the gastrointestinal complications
were highest during the first two weeks of
treatment with either  xxxd2450xxx  or methotrexate and declined thereafter.64a in addition,
 xxxd2450xxx  has been associated with rash/
allergic reactions, and reversible alopecia.
interestingly, there were no significant problems with anaemia, leucopenia, or thrombocytopenia, nor was there any increase in the
incidence of infection compared with placebo.
no opportunistic infections were noted.
treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  may have a
cytostatic evect, resulting from the inhibition
of pyrimidine biosynthesis in tissues with a
high rate of cellular turnover, such as those of
the gastrointestinal tract. this speculative
mechanism may also explain the incidence of
reversible alopecia, as well as the lack of opportunistic infection, marrow toxicity, and mucositis65 seen in clinical trials of  xxxd2450xxx .
the gastrointestinal adverse evects associated with high dose  xxxd2450xxx  (35 mg/kg/
day) in a lewis rat model of transplantation
were diarrhoea and pathological changes of the
small bowel and liver.66 these adverse evects
were significantly reduced by uridine coadministration, which implies the mechanism
leading to these side evects was related to
 xxxg633xxx  dependent cell proliferation.
early discussions of combination dmard
treatment67–69 recognised the potential benefit

www.annrheumdis.com

in the treatment of patients unresponsive to
traditional monotherapy, and, in particular, in
the treatment of aggressive disease in early
ra.68 69 wilke and clough highlight the need
for detailed information about the pharmacology and modes of action for each of the
combined drugs, and emphasise that
dmards used in combination should have
diverent modes of action.68 furst concluded
that evective combination treatment requires a
thorough knowledge of the toxicity, modes of
action, and pharmacokinetics of the combined
dmards.70 because of its unique mechanism
of action, the potential use of a77 1726 in
combination treatment with dmards is
promising.
methotrexate at the low doses used in the
treatment of ra inhibits purine biosynthesis,
and may have additional anti-inflammatory
activity related to adenosine release. a77 1726,
on the other hand, inhibits de novo pyrimidine
biosynthesis and lymphocyte proliferation.71
figure 5 summarises the unique modes of
action of both  xxxd2450xxx  (active metabolite
a77 1726) and methotrexate. the divering
modes of action present a rationale for the
combined treatment and may explain the synergistic evects of the two in combination.71 the
combination of methotrexate and  xxxd2450xxx 
has been proved to be evective for the
treatment of patients with active ra who were
refractory to treatment with methotrexate
alone.64
the clinical eycacy of combining a77 1726
with  xxxd1781xxx  has not been thoroughly
investigated, but in vitro studies of the drug
combination in animal models exhibit interesting complementary interactions. the rationale
for combining a77 1726 with drugs such as
 xxxd1781xxx  is that these early acting drugs
may not prevent all autoimmune lymphocytes
from entering g1. an additive interaction
between a77 1726 and  xxxd1781xxx  in
preventing t cell proliferation has already been
shown in vitro,12 and in a canine renal
transplant model.72 a77 1726, in combination
with cyclosporin, resulted in the longest mean
survival time, 68 days. it was also noted that a
combination of a77 1726 and cyclosporin,
both at suboptimal doses, evectively prolonged
mean survival time by three times that for controls, and that the animals had normal renal
function and weight. a similar evect was
observed for antigen induced arthritis in rats,
where a suboptimal dose of both drugs significantly inhibited chronic arthritis.73
the current prescribing information defines
the recommended dose and administration of
 xxxd2450xxx . owing to the long half life in
patients with ra and the 24 hour dosing interval, a loading dose of 100 mg/day for 3 days is
recommended, followed by a maintenance
dose of 20 mg/day for the duration of
treatment.74 if dosing at 20 mg/day is not well
tolerated, the dose may be decreased to 10
mg/day. liver enzyme levels should be
monitored, and dose adjustments made, if
necessary. because of the long half life for
the active metabolite, it is advised that during
dose adjustment patients should be carefully

848

breedveld, dayer

monitored, as the levels of metabolite may take
several weeks to reduce.74
summary and conclusions
 xxxd2450xxx  is a promising new antirheumatic
drug with novel properties and mild side
evects. the primary mechanism of action of
this drug is the inhibition of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. unlike other proliferating cell types, lymphocytes cannot undergo cell division when the pathway for the de
novo synthesis of pyrimidines is blocked. the
ability of other cell types that undergo
proliferation to use salvage pathways for
acquiring pyrimidines may explain the relatively mild side evects of  xxxd2450xxx .
new evidence shows that  xxxd2450xxx  inhibits the ability of t lymphocytes to stimulate
monocytes through direct cell-cell contact in
vitro.  xxxd2450xxx  was shown to suppress
preferentially the expression of proinflammatory molecules over their inhibitors, which
implies a biochemical mechanism for the
observed anti-inflammatory evects of  xxxd2450xxx  in the treatment of ra. preliminary clinical data support this hypothesis. synovial tissue
biopsies of patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx 
showed a decrease in the local production of
cams and mmps, contributing to the reported slowing of disease progression. the
unique immunomodulatory evects of  xxxd2450xxx  show promise for the treatment of ra,
alone and in combination treatment with other
dmards.
