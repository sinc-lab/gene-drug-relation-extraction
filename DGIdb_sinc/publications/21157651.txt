 xxxd3316xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg633xxx  for the potential oral treatment of multiple sclerosis.   xxxd3316xxx , being developed as a potential oral treatment for multiple sclerosis (ms) by sanofi-aventis, is the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis drug  xxxd2450xxx . both  xxxd3316xxx  and  xxxd2450xxx  are inhibitors of the mitochondrial enzyme  xxxg633xxx , which is critically involved in pyrimidine synthesis. the production of activated t-cells largely depends on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and thus pyrimidine depletion is thought to result in the inhibition of immune cell proliferation. therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd3316xxx  has been demonstrated in vivo in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of ms using dark agouti rats. in a phase ii, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with relapsing-remitting ms, treatment with  xxxd3316xxx  reduced the number of active lesions in the brain and preliminary evidence indicated a slowing in the development of disability. recently reported data from the phase iii temso clinical trial support these initial findings. compared with current therapies,  xxxd3316xxx  has the advantage of oral administration. thus, if good efficacy is demonstrated,  xxxd3316xxx  may have a role to play in the future treatment of ms.
