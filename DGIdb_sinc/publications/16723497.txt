the serotonin type 3 receptor ( xxxg1116xxx ) is a member of the
cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel gene family, which includes the muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (achr), the  xxxg904xxx , and the gaba type a
receptor (connolly and wafford, 2004; lester et al., 2004).
two different subunits, termed  xxxg1116xxx  and 5-ht3b, have
been shown to be present in functional 5-ht3rs (reeves and
lummis, 2002). in addition, several other putative  xxxg1116xxx 
genes have been described, but whether or not they play a
role in  xxxg1116xxx -mediated processes is unknown at present
(karnovsky et al., 2003). the  xxxg1116xxx  subunit alone can form
functional receptors with the appropriate pharmacological
properties when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes or mammalian cells. however, receptors comprising only the  xxxg1116xxx 
subunit have single-channel conductances in the subpicosiemens range, whereas those containing both the  xxxg1116xxx  and
5-ht3b subunits have conductances in the 10- to 30-ps range
(davies et al., 1999; dubin et al., 1999; hanna et al., 2000),
similar to that observed in neurons from the peripheral nerthis work was supported by a grant from the american heart association

dtc analogs and asn128 suggests that asn128 makes a direct
interaction with the 2⬘n of dtc. molecular modeling of the
 xxxg1116xxx  extracellular domain using the antagonist-bound conformation of the aplysia californica acetylcholine binding protein as a template followed by ligand docking simulations produces two classes of structures of the  xxxg1116xxx /dtc complex;
only one of these has the 2⬘n of dtc positioned at asn128 and
thus is consistent with the data from this study and previously
published data. the use of the rigid dtc analogs as “molecular
rulers” in conjunction with double-mutant cycle analysis of
mutant receptors can allow the spatial mapping of the position
of various residues in the ligand-binding site.

vous system (derkach et al., 1989; yang et al., 1992). the
reduction in single-channel conductance of homomeric
5-ht3ars is now know to be due to the presence of three
arginine residues in the cytoplasmic domain, and removal of
these three positive charges results in a single-channel conductance on the order of 25 ps (kelley et al., 2003). analysis
of the expression patterns of the  xxxg1116xxx  and 5-ht3b subunits
has led to the suggestion that the bulk of the 5-ht3rs in the
central nervous system are  xxxg1116xxx  homomers, whereas those
in the peripheral nervous system are a mixture of  xxxg1116xxx 
homomers and  xxxg1116xxx /5-ht3b heteromers (morales and
wang, 2002). however, despite the differences in the singlechannel properties of the two types of receptors, they have
essentially identical ligand-binding properties (brady et al.,
2001). thus, homomeric 5-ht3ars should be an appropriate
model for the structure of the ligand-binding domain of native 5-ht3rs, regardless of whether they are  xxxg1116xxx  homomers or  xxxg1116xxx /5-ht3b heteromers.
structural models for the  xxxg1116xxx  have recently been developed by several groups (maksay et al., 2003; reeves et al.,
2003; yan and white, 2005), taking advantage of the homology between the various members of the ligand-gated ion
channel family and a soluble ach-binding protein (achbp)
isolated from the snail lymnaea stagnalis, for which the

abstract
the serotonin  xxxg1116xxx  ( xxxg1116xxx ) is a member of the
cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel family. we have used the
combination of site-directed mutagenesis, homology modeling
of the  xxxg1116xxx  extracellular domain, and ligand docking simulations as a way to map the architecture of the  xxxg1116xxx  ligand
binding domain. mutation of phe226 in loop c of the binding
site to tyrosine (f226y) has no effect on the apparent affinity of
the competitive antagonist  xxxd3456xxx  (dtc) for the receptor. on the other hand, replacement of asn128 in loop a of the
binding site with alanine (n128a) increases the apparent affinity
of dtc by approximately 10-fold. double-mutant cycle analysis
employing a panel of dtc analogs with substitutions at various
positions to identify specific points of interactions between the

affinity allows us to map the interaction of asn128 to a
particular region of dtc. taken in conjunction with molecular modeling studies and the results of our previous study,
these data allow us to determine the orientation of dtc in the
ligand-binding domain and map different regions of the antagonist onto residues in the ligand-binding domain.

materials and methods
molecular biology and transfection. a full-length cdna clone
corresponding to the  xxxg1116xxx (b) form (hope et al., 1993) of the receptor
was isolated from a neuroblastoma n1e-115 cell line cdna library
as described previously (yan et al., 1999) and subcloned into vector
pci (promega, madison, wi). site-directed mutagenesis was carried
out using the quikchange system (stratagene, la jolla, ca) as
described previously (yan et al., 1999). the nomenclature used to
describe mutants is amino acid in wild-type/position/substitution
(e.g., n128a). because the amino terminus of the mature  xxxg1116xxx 
subunit is unknown, the amino acid numbering system used here
includes the signal sequence and starts from the initial methionine.
cultures of tsa201 cells, a derivative of the widely used human
embryonic kidney 293 cell line, were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100
units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. cultures at 30 to
40% confluence were transfected with 6 ␮g of receptor cdna per
100-mm dish using the fugene transfection reagent (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in). maximal expression was obtained 36 to 72 h
after transfection.
ligand binding assays. transfected cells were scraped from
dishes, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended and homogenized in 2.5 ml of 154 mm nacl, 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.4, per 100 mm dish. the homogenate was then used
in binding assays or frozen until needed. we observed no change in
either ligand affinity or bmax values after freezing.
membranes were incubated for 2 h at 37° in a total volume of 0.5
ml of 154 mm nacl and 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, containing the
appropriate concentrations of the competing unlabeled ligand and
radioligand ([3h]granisetron, 85 ci/mmol; perkinelmer life and analytical sciences, boston, ma). binding was terminated by rapid
vacuum filtration onto gf/b filters that had been pretreated with 50
mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, and 0.2% polyethylenimine, and the filters
were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, per
sample. nonspecific binding was defined as that binding not displaced by 100 ␮m m-chlorophenyl biguanide. ic50 values for the
various dtc analogs were determined by fitting the data to the
following equation, using a levenberg-marquardt algorithm in a
commercially available software package (igor pro; wavemetrics,
oswego, or): ␪ ⫽ [1 ⫹ ([i]/ic50)nh]⫺1, where ␪ is the fractional
amount of [3h]granisetron bound in the presence of the antagonist at
concentration [i] compared with that in the absence of antagonist,
ic50 is the concentration of antagonist at which ␪ ⫽ 0.5, and nh is the
apparent hill coefficient. ki values were calculated from the ic50
values and the kd for [3h]granisetron using the cheng-prusoff relation (cheng and prusoff, 1973): ki ⫽ ic50/[1 ⫹ ([l]/kd)], where [l] is
the concentration of [3h]granisetron used to determine the ic50
value in the experiment and kd is the dissociation constant for
[3h]granisetron. for the cheng-prusoff relation to be applicable, the
hill coefficient for the ic50 curve must be equal to 1. in our experiments, all hill coefficients were not statistically different from unity
at a 95% confidence level (data not shown). in this study, all experiments were carried out with a [3h]granisetron concentration equal
to its experimentally determined dissociation constant for the particular receptor (wt, 3.0 nm; n128a, 1.7 nm; f226y, 1.6 nm),
meaning that the measured ic50 values were twice the ki.

structure has been solved to atomic resolution (brejc et al.,
2001; smit et al., 2001). in these various models, liganddocking simulations produce several orientations of agonists
(reeves et al., 2003) or antagonists (maksay et al., 2003;
thompson et al., 2005; yan and white, 2005) in the binding
site, and the authors used data obtained from mutagenesis
studies to evaluate models for consistency with experimental
data to select feasible structural models for receptor-ligand
interactions. in some cases, the investigators correlated
the effects of a number of previously studied mutations in the
receptor on ligand affinity with expectations derived from the
structural models (maksay et al., 2003; reeves et al., 2003),
whereas in others, mutations designed after the model was
created were used to test the model (thompson et al., 2005;
yan and white, 2005). although most of these studies involved monitoring the effect of changing only the receptor, we
combined the approach of introducing mutations in the receptor itself with alterations in ligand structure to more fully
probe ligand-receptor interactions via double-mutant cycle
analysis (yan and white, 2005). with this approach, we were
able to map different portions of the antagonist granisetron
onto different regions of the ligand-binding site, allowing an
unambiguous discrimination among different models with
different orientations of the antagonist granisetron in the
binding site. assuming that one can introduce structural
changes in both the receptor and the ligand, the application
of double-mutant cycle analysis represents a powerful for
probing ligand-receptor interactions.
a limiting factor in the application of double-mutant cycle
analysis to nonpeptidic ligands is the availability of a panel of
ligands with a number of defined small changes in structure.
one ligand that can be altered in a number of ways is dtubocurarine (dtc). although well known as a neuromuscular blocking agent (bernard and pelouze, 1850) and nicotinic
achr competitive antagonist (jenkinson, 1960), it also has
nanomolar affinity for the murine  xxxg1116xxx  (lummis et al.,
1990; peters et al., 1990; newberry et al., 1991). using a
series of dtc analogs originally designed for analysis of
dtc-achr interactions (pedersen and papineni, 1995; papineni and pedersen, 1997), we demonstrated that the same
regions of dtc that were important for high-affinity binding
to the achr were also important for binding to the  xxxg1116xxx 
(yan et al., 1998), reinforcing the notion that the ligandbinding domains of the achr and the  xxxg1116xxx  share common
features. in a subsequent study, we examined the effects of
two mutations known to affect antagonist binding to the
 xxxg1116xxx  (w90f and r92a) on the affinity of a series of dtc
analogs (yan and white, 2002). we found that the w90f
mutation decreased dtc affinity, whereas the r92a mutation increased dtc affinity, and that the alteration in affinity
was more or less equal for all analogs examined. this led us
to conclude that although these two residues might affect the
overall properties of the binding site, they did not make a
direct physical contact with those portions of dtc that we
could modify.
in this study, we have examined the effects of two additional mutations in residues near granisetron in our model
(n128a and f226y) on the interaction of dtc with the
 xxxg1116xxx . we find that although the f226y mutation has no
effect on the affinity of any of the analogs tested, the n128a
mutation increases the affinity of some (but not all) of the
analogs. the differential effect of this mutation on analog

results
we focused on two amino acid residues (asn128 and
phe226) in the 5-ht3ar that were predicted to be near granisetron in our model of the granisetron-5-ht3ar complex
(yan and white, 2005). neither mutation had a statistically
significant effect on the affinity of granisetron, in agreement
with a previous report (thompson et al., 2005). we obtained
estimates for the affinity of a number of dtc analogs (fig. 1)
with wild-type, n128a, and f226y mutant 5-ht3rs using
competitive inhibition of the binding of the antagonist
[3h]granisetron (table 1). although the f226y mutation had
no effect on the affinity for all five compounds tested, the
n128a mutation did have statistically significant effects on
the affinity of some, but not all, of the ligands. figure 2 shows
the inhibition of [3h]granisetron binding to wild-type and
n128a receptors by dtc (top) and tubocurine (bottom). the
n128a mutation increases the apparent affinity of dtc for
the receptor approximately 6-fold, whereas it has no effect on
the affinity for tubocurine. these two compounds differ only
by the presence of an additional methyl group on the 2⬘n of
the molecule, converting the tertiary amine of tubocurine to
a quaternary amine in dtc. the differential sensitivity suggests that asn128 interacts with the 2⬘n of the antagonist.
examination of the effect of the mutation on other analogs
indicates that the mutation increases the affinity of those
analogs with a quaternary amine at the 2⬘n position, but has
no effect on the affinity of the analogs that have a tertiary
amine at the 2⬘n position.
to explore this further, we analyzed the effects of the
n128a mutation on a number of analogs using double-mutant cycle analysis. double-mutant cycle analysis (carter et
al., 1984) can be used to determine whether or not a particular residue interacts with a particular portion of a ligand.
the underlying logic of this approach is that if residue x in
the binding site interacts with residue y on the ligand, then
the effect of mutating x should depend upon whether residue
y in the ligand is changed or not. an interaction parameter,
⍀, is calculated from the kd or ki values as (kw,l1/kw,l2)/
(km,l1/km,l2), where the subscripts indicate the following: w
for wild-type receptor, m for mutant receptor, and l1 and l2
for the two ligands being compared. an ⍀ value significantly
different from 1 indicates an interaction between the functional group on the ligand and the residue in question on the
receptor. although initially used for analysis of the interaction of peptide toxins with k⫹ channels (hildago and mackinnon, 1995), this approach has also been applied to identify points of contact between achrs and peptide toxins
(malany et al., 2000), achrs and  xxxd3456xxx  analogs
(willcockson et al., 2002) and granisetron and the  xxxg1116xxx 
(yan and white, 2005).

the interaction of dtc analogs with the receptor. the right

in which the difference in the ligands is only at the 2⬘n; dtc

5.5 ⫾ 1.2 is obtained, consistent with the n128a mutation
affecting a direct interaction between the 2⬘n of dtc and
asn128 of the receptor. the left side of the figure shows the

molecular modeling and ligand docking. a structural model
of the extracellular domain of the mouse 5ht3ar was generated
using version 7.7 of the program modeller (sali and blundell,
1993), using the x-ray structure of both the lymnaea stagnalis
achbp [protein data bank id 1i9b (brejc et al., 2001)] and the
methllycaconitine-bound form of the aplysia californica achbp
[protein data bank id 2byr, (hansen et al., 2005)] as templates as
described previously (yan and white, 2005).
 xxxd3456xxx  was docked to each binding site in the chosen
model using autodock 3.0 (morris et al., 1998). solvation parameters
were added to the protein coordinate file and the ligand torsions were
defined using the addsol and autotors utilities, respectively, in
autodock 3.0. gasteiger-marsili charges were applied to ligands
before docking (gasteiger and marsili, 1980), which use the united
atom representation for nonpolar hydrogens. the docking was performed with the initial population size set to 100 with 100 independent runs using otherwise default parameters in the standard protocol on a 30 ⫻ 30 ⫻ 40-å grid with spacing of 0.375 å. the size of the
grid gives sufficient freedom for the ligands to be docked in all
possible orientations but does not permit them move outside of the
binding site. in addition to returning the docked structure, autodock
also calculates an affinity constant for each ligand-receptor configuration. autodock allows flexibility in the ligand, and it has been
shown that conformations of ligands docked in a binding site with
autodock agree with bound conformations in crystal structures of
ligand-protein complexes (osterberg et al., 2002). images were produced using the ucsf chimera package (pettersen et al., 2004) from
the computer graphics laboratory, university of california, san
francisco (supported by national institutes of health grant p41rr01081).

granisetron, dtc could not fit into the binding site as a
high-affinity complex (data not shown). analysis of the structure of the related a. californica achbp in the apo, agonistbound, and antagonist-bound states has demonstrated that
loop c is in different positions depending upon what is bound
to the protein (celie et al., 2005; hansen et al., 2005). when
agonists are bound to the protein, loop c closes down on the
agonist; in the apo or antagonist-bound form, the loop rotates
outward like a paddle, with the tip of the loop moving 7 to 11
å away from the bulk of the achbp. with a model derived
from the agonist-bound conformation (i.e., the l. stagnalis
achbp structure), dtc is presumably too large to easily
enter the site with the loop c covering the entrance, whereas
it can do so in models derived from the more open apo or
antagonist-bound conformation.
two main clusters of dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  complexes were obtained from the modeling runs using the model derived from
the methyllycaconitine-bound form of the a. californica
achbp. figure 4 shows representative complexes from each

there is no interaction between the 2n of dtc and asn128.

⍀ value for this cycle is 1.4 ⫾ 0.2, suggesting that there is no
direct interaction between asn128 and the 2n of dtc.
table 2 shows the ⍀ values determined form a total of
seven double-mutant cycles. in all cases in which there is a
difference at the 2⬘n position between the two ligands in the
pair (dtc/tubocurine, dtc/ xxxd2625xxx , dtc/o,o-dimethyltubocurine,  xxxd2625xxx /tubocurine), an ⍀ value significantly
different from 1 is obtained, whereas for those cycles in which
there is no difference at the 2⬘n position (but there are
differences at other positions), the ⍀ value is close to 1.
to gain some insight into potential interactions between
dtc and asn128 and other residues in the  xxxg1116xxx  ligandbinding site, we carried out ligand-docking simulations between dtc and the  xxxg1116xxx  ligand-binding domain using a
model for the receptor created by homology modeling with
the l. stagnalis achbp as the template. we had previously
used this model of the ligand-binding domain in our analysis
of granisetron/ xxxg1116xxx  interactions. analysis of the results of
docking dtc with this model showed that in contrast to

in this study (asn128 and phe226). in fig. 4a, the 2n of dtc
is near asn128 and the 2⬘n is near arg92; in fig. 4b, the
orientation of dtc is reversed, with the 2n at arg92 and the
2⬘n at asn128. the vast majority of the high-affinity ligandreceptor models (approximately 90%) were in the orientation
shown in fig. 4a. examination of the potential interactions
in these two models in the context of experimental data can
provide useful information concerning the orientation of dtc
in the  xxxg1116xxx  ligand-binding site and identify important
interactions that determine affinity of the ligand for the
receptor.

delineation of the interactions between a given receptor
and its ligands can provide useful information for understanding how ligands can affect receptor function as well as
for the synthesis of novel ligands with high affinity and

whereas in b, the orientation is reversed.

information from mutational analysis of ligand-receptor interactions is combined with molecular modeling studies to
more fully examine ligand-receptor interactions than could
be done by using either approach by itself. in addition, by
varying the structure of both the receptor (by site-directed
mutagenesis) and the ligand (such as by using derivatives of
dtc in this study), we are able to determine which parts of
the ligand make direct interactions with specific residues in
the receptor.
the data presented in tables 1 and 2 strongly suggest that
asn128 in loop a of the  xxxg1116xxx  makes a direct interaction
with the quaternary amine at the 2⬘n of dtc. replacement of
asparagine with alanine at this position (n128a) results in
an increase in apparent affinity only for those analogs with a
quaternary amine at this position (dtc, chondocurarine,  xxxd2625xxx ), whereas those analogs with a tertiary amine at
this position (tubocurine, o,o-dimethyltubocurine) are unaffected by this mutation. double-mutant cycle analysis further bears this out; changes at the 2⬘n produce a coupling
coefficient, ⍀, different from 1, whereas cycles with a change
at other positions produce ⍀ values at or near 1.
molecular modeling of dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  complexes using the a.
californica achbp in the antagonist-bound form as a template produces two classes of models. in one, dtc is oriented
in the ligand-binding site with the 2⬘n near arg92 and the
2n near asn128; in the other, the orientation of dtc is
flipped. although the majority of ligand-receptor models
were in the former orientation, the mutation data are consistent only with the latter model, in which the 2⬘n is near
asn128, once again demonstrating the necessity of validating
structural models with experimental data specifically designed to test the models.
what type of interaction could asn128 make with dtc at
the 2⬘n position? because the side chain of asn128 is uncharged, the increase in affinity after the alanine substitution cannot be due to removal of a charge-charge repulsion.
rather, the increase in affinity is more likely to be due to a
steric effect by replacing a larger side chain [asparagine,
117.7 å3 (zamyatnin, 1984)] with a smaller one (alanine, 88.6
å3). this could result in a better fit of the quaternary amine
of dtc at the 2⬘n position within the binding site, allowing
better interactions with other determinants of dtc binding.
when a smaller tertiary amine is in this position, the steric
interaction is less or absent, and reducing the size of the side
chain has no effect on affinity.
we previously examined the effects of two different mutations in loop d of the ligand-binding site of the  xxxg1116xxx  on the
interaction of dtc with the receptor (yan and white, 2002).
in that study, replacement of arg92 with alanine (r92a)
increased the affinity of dtc for the receptor approximately
8- to 10-fold compared with wild-type receptors and replacement of trp90 with phenylalanine (w90f) decreased the
affinity of dtc approximately 4-fold. examination of the
affinities of a number of dtc analogs with r92a and w90f
receptors led us to conclude that neither residue made a
specific interaction with dtc. this conclusion was based on
the expectation that if specific interactions did occur, we
would observe a differential effect of substitutions at one
position of dtc. however, all analogs showed more or less
the same change in affinity as dtc. double-mutant cycle
analysis of the interaction of dtc analogs with the r92a and
w90f mutants is also consistent with this idea, in that all

fold decrease in dtc affinity, whereas the reciprocal replacements in the human receptor results in an approximately
50-fold increase in dtc affinity. although these results do
demonstrate that the differences in the sequences of loop c
between the two species are partially responsible for the
differences in dtc affinity, they account for only some of
the differential sensitivity. examination of the positions
of the residues in loop e [his(arg)145, arg(gln)147, with the
corresponding human residue in parentheses] and loop
f [ser(leu)197, glu(lys)200, arg(lys)202, lys(arg)205,
ile(met)209] that differ between the two species in the model
of the dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  complex used in this study shows that the
residues in loop e are far from the docked dtc and thus may
not contribute to the species difference in dtc affinity,
whereas three in loop f (glu200, arg202, lys205) may be
close enough to affect dtc-receptor interactions. the most
significant difference in this region is the replacement of a
negatively charged glutamate in the mouse receptor (glu200)
with a positively charged lysine in the human receptor.
charge reversal at this position could affect dtc-receptor
interaction and may contribute to the observed differences in
affinity between the two species. the effect could be due
either to the removal of a direct interaction between glu200
and dtc or to an alteration of a structural component of the
binding site. in the ␤-strand conformation of loop f, the side
chain of glu200 would be next to that of the positively
charged arg202in the mouse receptor, perhaps forming a salt
bridge that plays a role in the conformation of the binding
site. in the human receptor, glu200 is replaced by a lysine
residue and arg202 is replaced by a lysine residue. in this
situation, rather than having a potential salt-bridge pair, the
human receptor has two positive resides, which may lead to
a charge-charge repulsion and a subsequent alteration of the
conformation of the binding site which may result in a lower
affinity for dtc. given that the poor structural resolution of
loop f in the achbp (brejc et al., 2001) and the uncertainty
in the exact positions of side chains in any structural models
derived from homology considerations, this interpretation is
highly speculative and awaits further experimental analysis
before any firm conclusions are justified.
there has been one other modeling study on the interaction of dtc with the  xxxg1116xxx  (maksay et al., 2003). these
authors used the l. stagnalis achbp as the template for
modeling, and a single model for the dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  complex
was presented for the mouse and human receptors. although
it is difficult to discern the detailed structure of the published
model, and no information about the predicted affinity of the
ligand-receptor complex was presented, it seems to be somewhat similar to the model that we discarded as being inconsistent with our data (i.e., with the 2n near asn128). however, it must be noted that they used the lymnaea achbp as
the template for modeling, and we were unable to obtain any
high-affinity dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  complexes using models derived
from this template. although the authors considered their
model to be consistent with experimental results obtained by
other workers, the level of comparison of their model with
actual results was somewhat cursory. until experiments are
designed to directly test a given model, one should not put too
much credence in a given model.
two other groups have combined molecular modeling with
mutational analysis to examine the interaction of dtc with
the achbp and the achr. in the case of the achbp, gao et

cycles examined produced ⍀ values close to 1 (data not
shown).
examination of the dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  model, which is consistent
with the data presented in this study, explains the effects
previously reported. in this model, arg92 is close to the
tertiary amine at the 2n position. removal of the positive
charge at arg92 (r92a) increases dtc affinity, which would
be consistent with the removal of a charge-charge repulsion
between the asparagine and the positively charged amine.
all analogs tested have a positive charge at the 2n position,
some as a tertiary amine (e.g., tubocurine) and others as a
quaternary amine (e.g., chondocurarine). the pka of the tertiary amine at the 2n position of dtc is on the order of 9.5 or
10 (barlow, 1982), so both the tertiary and quaternary
amines would be positively changed under the conditions
employed in this study. thus, each analog would increase
affinity to the same extent because of the loss of the chargecharge repulsion, and we would not have observed any differential effect of various analogs in our previous study because all analogs tested retain the charge at the 2n position.
what about the decrease in affinity observed with the
w90f mutation? in the model, trp90 is positioned somewhat
perpendicular to the aromatic ring in dtc-containing positions 13 and 12. this could provide an aromatic-aromatic
interaction (burley and petsko, 1985), which could contribute
to the overall binding. we have shown previously that substitutions at the 12 and 13 positions decreased the affinity of
dtc analogs relative to dtc for wild-type, r92a, and w90f
receptors (yan et al., 1998; yan and white, 2002). dtc has a
hydrogen at position 13 and a hydroxyl at position 12. substitutions at either position (methoxy at position 12 and
iodine, bromine, or sulfonate at position 13) all increase the
size of the substituents on the aromatic ring, possibly creating a steric impediment to the aromatic-aromatic interaction.
replacement of tryptophan with phenylalanine (w90f) may
also move the aromatic ring just enough to weaken/eliminate
the interaction, resulting in the observed 4-fold decrease in
affinity.
we have identified three residues (trp90, arg92, and
asn128) as playing important roles in dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  interactions. the human  xxxg1116xxx  has an approximately 1500-fold
lower affinity for dtc than does the murine receptor (bufton
et al., 1993; hope et al., 1996; yan et al., 1998; hope et al.,
1999). examination of the sequences of the six binding loops
of the murine and human receptors shows that loops a, b,
and d are identical in the two species, whereas loops c, e,
and f contain some differences between the two species.
trp90 and arg92 are in loop d, and asn128 is in loop a, and
are conserved between the two species, so they do not play a
role in the differential sensitivity between the two species.
phe226 (which does not interact with dtc but is presumably
in the binding site) is in loop c, but this residue is also
conserved between the two species, so it is not responsible for
the difference in affinity between the two species. hope et al.
(1999) examined the effects of the species differences in loop
c on dtc affinity. there are six differences between the
murine and the human receptors in this loop and the adjacent sequence. no single amino acid replacement between
mouse and human sequences in this region resulted in more
than a 9-fold change in affinity. replacement of all six residues in the murine receptor with the corresponding residues
from the human receptor results in an approximately 150-

al. (2003) concluded that dtc bound to the achbp with the
2⬘n near (but not immediately adjacent to) gln55 in loop d
(which is homologous to arg92 in the  xxxg1116xxx ) and the 2n
near (but not immediately adjacent to) tyr89 in loop a
(which is homologous to asn128 in the  xxxg1116xxx ). this model
is somewhat similar to the model of maksay et al. (2003) for
the dtc/ xxxg1116xxx  complex and the model that we discarded
based on our double-mutant cycle analysis. mutational analysis was consistent with this model, but only two analogs
(dtc and  xxxd2625xxx ) were employed in the analysis. because dtc and  xxxd2625xxx  differ at three different positions
(fig. 1), maksay et al. (2003) would not be able to conclusively assign interactions of different portions of dtc (or
 xxxd2625xxx ) within the binding site as would be possible with
a larger set of analogs
using a more complete set of mutations and analogs and
double-mutant cycle analysis, willcockson et al. (2002) examined the interaction of dtc with the mouse muscle achr.
using their experimental data and modeling of the dtcachr complex with the achbp as a template, they concluded that the orientation of dtc in the complex was such
that the 2⬘n was near ␣tyr93 of the achr (homologous to
asn128 in the  xxxg1116xxx ) and the 2n is near ␥tyr117 (homologous to gln151 in the  xxxg1116xxx ), similar to the model that is
consistent with our experimental data. exactly why two
groups working on very similar proteins should obtain essentially opposite orientations of dtc in the binding site is
unclear, but given that the model for the dtc-achr complex
obtained by willcoxson et al. (2002) has more rigorous experimental support, we prefer that one. it should be noted that
the exact orientation of dtc in all of the models is different
in each laboratory, and no two models are exactly the same;
this is a reflection of the uncertainties of the fine details of
molecular modeling.
this study shows the power of double-mutant cycle analysis with small molecule ligands of differing structure to
probe ligand-receptor interactions in a way that can map
differing portions of the ligand onto specific regions of the
receptor. in conjunction with molecular modeling studies,
an iterative loop of modeling and experimental testing of
models can be created that can accelerate the process of
elucidating the three-dimensional architecture of a ligandbinding domain. inclusion of a wide variety of ligands and
mutant receptors should allow the examination of the architecture of the entire ligand-binding domain and thus
provide useful information for the design of novel pharmacological agents with both high affinity and high specificity
for use as therapeutic agents.
