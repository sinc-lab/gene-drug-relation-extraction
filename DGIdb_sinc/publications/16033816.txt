abstract: mutations in the granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor receptor ( xxxg529xxx ) gene resulting in carboxy terminal truncation have been associated with acute myeloid leukemia (aml). the
truncated  xxxg529xxx  from aml patients mediate enhanced and prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( xxxg2216xxx ). it
has been shown that src homology-2 (sh2)-containng tyrosine phosphatase-1 attenuates the intensity of g-csf-induced  xxxg2216xxx  activation through interacting with the carboxy terminus of the  xxxg529xxx .
using a series of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution mutants, we show here that tyrosine (tyr) 729,
located in the carboxy terminus of the  xxxg529xxx ,
controls the duration of g-csf-stimulated activation of  xxxg2216xxx , akt, and  xxxg1369xxx /2. it is interesting that activation of
these signaling molecules by g-csf was prolonged
by pretreating cells with  xxxd1800xxx  d or cyclohexamide, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required for appropriate termination of
 xxxg529xxx  signaling. the transcripts for suppressor
of cytokine signaling 3 (socs3) and socs1 were
up-regulated rapidly upon g-csf stimulation.
expression of socs3 or socs1, but not socs2
and cytokine-inducible sh2 domain-containing protein, completely suppressed g-csf-induced  xxxg2216xxx 
activation but had only a weak effect on  xxxg2216xxx 
activation mediated by the receptor mutant lacking
tyr 729. socs1 and socs3 also inhibited g-csfdependent cell proliferation, but the inhibitory effect of the two socs proteins on cell proliferation
was diminished when tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  was
mutated. these data indicate that tyr 729 of the
 xxxg529xxx  is required for socs1- and socs3-mediated negative regulation of  xxxg529xxx  signaling
and that the duration and intensity of g-csf-induced  xxxg2216xxx  activation are regulated by two distinct
mechanisms. j. leukoc. biol. 78: 1008 –1015;

introduction
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) is a hematopoietic cytokine, which is critically involved in the regulation of

granulopoiesis [1]. g-csf supports the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of myeloid progenitor cells. the g-csf
receptor ( xxxg529xxx ), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, mediates the biological actions of g-csf. stimulation
of cells with g-csf activates multiple intracellular signal
transduction pathways, which are important for the biological
activities of g-csf. these include signal transducers and
activators of transcription (stats), mitogen-activated protein
kinase, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/akt cascades,
among others [2, 3]. the  xxxg529xxx  lacks intrinsic kinase activities in the cytoplasmic domain and transduces signals via
interacting with intracellular protein kinases such as the janus
 xxxg2198xxx  (jak) and src family kinases [2, 3].
g-csf stimulates the activation of stat3,  xxxg2216xxx , and to a
lesser extent, stat1. stat3 was identified as being critical for
g-csf-induced cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival
[4, 5], but a recent study using conditional gene ablation in
transgenic mice indicated that stat3 may negatively regulate
granulopoiesis [6].  xxxg2216xxx  exists in two major forms, i.e., stat5a
and  xxxg2216xxx , which are encoded by two closely related genes,
and has been shown to positively regulate cell proliferation and
granulocytic differentiation induced by g-csf [7, 8]. although
stat5a/b-deficient mice were not neutropenic, bone marrow
cells from these mice exhibited reduced response to g-csf
stimulation in in vitro colony formation assay [9]. apart from its
role in normal granulopoiesis,  xxxg2216xxx  also appears to play a part
in leukemogenesis. expression of leukemogenic proteins such
as bcr-abl, tel-jak2, and fms-like fetal liver  xxxg2198xxx 
3/internal tandem duplication is associated with constitutive
activation of  xxxg2216xxx  [10 –13]. notably, deregulated activation of
 xxxg2216xxx  alone can convert interleukin (il)-3-dependent cells to
growth factor independence [14].
mutations in the  xxxg529xxx  gene have been identified in a
subgroup of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (aml)
evolving from severe congenital neutropenia (scn) [15–18].
these mutations, which result in the carboxy terminal truncation of the  xxxg529xxx , are almost always present in the patients
who developed aml after a history of scn, strongly suggesting
that the mutations have a role in leukemogenesis. expression
of the truncated  xxxg529xxx  in hematopoietic cells leads to
augmented cell proliferation and survival but defective granu-

locytic differentiation [15, 19]. notably, g-csf-stimulated activation of  xxxg2216xxx  is markedly enhanced and prolonged in these
cells [7, 20], indicating that the carboxy terminal region of the
 xxxg529xxx  negatively regulates  xxxg2216xxx  activation. it has been
shown that src homology 2 (sh2)-containing protein tyrosine
phosphatase-1 ( xxxg1895xxx ) negatively regulates the intensity, but
not the duration, of g-csf-stimulated  xxxg2216xxx  activation [21].
the negative effect of  xxxg1895xxx  on  xxxg2216xxx  activation requires the
carboxy terminus of the  xxxg529xxx , but the tyrosine residues
located in the receptor’s carboxy terminus are dispensable for
 xxxg1895xxx  action [21, 22]. in this paper, we show that tyrosine (tyr)
729 of the  xxxg529xxx , located in the receptor’s carboxy terminus, controls the duration of g-csf-stimulated activation of
 xxxg2216xxx , akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kianse 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /
2). our data also strongly suggest that suppressor of cytokine
signaling (socs)1 and socs3 are involved in the negative
regulation of  xxxg529xxx  signaling, presumably through interacting with tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx .

materials and methods

transfected with 10 ␮g empty vector or expression constructs for socs1 and
socs3 by electroporation as described previously [25].

western blot analysis
cells were starved in the absence of serum for 4 h and subsequently stimulated
with g-csf (20 ng/ml) for the times indicated. cells were washed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm tris, ph
7.5, 150 mm nacl, 10 mm naf, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% triton x-100, 1
mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm vanadate). after incubation on
ice for 20 min, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min
at 4°c. supernatants were collected, and proteins were separated by sodium
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to transfer to immobilon membranes. the membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies. western blots were developed using ecl.

northern blot analysis
total rna was extracted with rna-beetm rna isolation reagent (tel-test
inc., friendswood, tx). rna (10 ␮g) was run on a 1% agarose gel and
transferred to a hybond-n membrane (amersham biosciences, piscataway,
nj). the membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 42°c in northernmaxtm
hybridiztion buffer (ambion, austin, tx) and hybridized overnight at 42°c
after addition of the [␥-32p]-labeled probe. the membrane was washed and
developed.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa)

cells
murine 32d and ba/f3 cells expressing the wild-type (wt) and the  xxxd715xxx  form
of the human  xxxg529xxx  have been described [19]. cells were grown in
rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 10%
wehi-3b cell-conditioned media, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. 293t cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
containing 10% fbs supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin.

reagents
antibodies against akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 and phospho-specific antibodies against
akt,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and  xxxg2216xxx  were purchased from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma). anti  xxxg2216xxx  (c-17) antibody was from santa cruz biotechnology (ca).
monoclonal antibody to the  xxxg529xxx  was obtained from bd biosciences (san
diego, ca). anti-flag (m2) antibody was from sigma chemical co. (st.
louis, mo). [␥-32p]adenosine 5⬘-triphosphate (atp) and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) kit were purchased from perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences (boston, ma) and pierce biotechnology (rockford, il), respectively.
fugene 6 transfection reagent was from roche diagnostics (indianapolis,
in). fluorophore-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody
(alexa fluor威 488) was purchased from molecular probes (eugene, or).

stable transfection

emsas were performed as described previously using whole cell extracts [7].
the ␤-casein probe (5⬘-agatttctaggaattcaaatc-3⬘), derived from the
promoter of the bovine ␤-casein gene, was end-labeled using polynucleotide
kinase and [␥-32p]atp.

flow cytometry
cells (106) were incubated at 4°c for 30 min sequentially with the anti-gcsf-r antibody (1 ␮g/100 ␮l) and the fluorophore-labeled goat anti-mouse
igg antibody (2 ␮g/100 ␮l), with washing between each step. samples were
analyzed by flow cytometry using a facscan (becton dickinson, san jose, ca).

cell proliferation assay
cell proliferation was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium (mts; celltiter 96威
aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay, promega, madison, wi). after
extensive washing, 2 ⫻ 104 cells were incubated in triplicate in 100 ␮l
rpmi-1640 medium in 96-well plates in the presence of g-csf (20 ng/ml) for
24 h. mts (10 ␮l) was added to each well, and the plates were read 2 h later
at 490 nm wavelength in a microplate luminometer (molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca).

results

the cdnas encoding the different tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution mutants of the  xxxg529xxx  (kindly provided by dr. ivo p. touw, erasmus university,
rotterdam) were cloned in the pbabe-puro retroviral expression vector as
described [23]. 32d cells were transfected by electroporation and selected in
medium containing  xxxd3041xxx  (1 ␮g/ml), 24 h after transfection. individual
clones were expanded and examined for expression of transfected proteins by
western blotting. three independent clones were pooled and used in subsequent experiments.

transient transfection
the expression vectors encoding flag-tagged cytokine-inducible sh2-domain-containing protein (cis), socs1, socs2, socs3, and stat5a have been
described [7, 24]. 293t cells were plated on 24-well plates and transfected
with 0.1 ␮g pbabe  xxxg529xxx , 0.5 ␮g pxm-stat5a, and 0.1 ␮g socs expression
vectors using fugene 6. in some experiments, higher amounts of socs
expression vectors were used to see the expression of different socs proteins.
twenty hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 4 h and
stimulated with g-csf for the times as indicated. ba/f3 cells were transiently

it has been shown that truncation of the carboxy terminal
region of the  xxxg529xxx , as seen in some patients with aml/
scn, resulted in enhanced and prolonged  xxxg2216xxx  activation in
response to g-csf [7]. this region contains three tyrosine
residues, i.e., tyr 729, tyr 744, and tyr 764, which are
involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation [23,
26, 27]. to investigate whether the carboxy terminal tyrosine
residues have a role in modulating g-csf-stimulated  xxxg2216xxx 
activation, we expressed a series of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine
substitution mutants of the  xxxg529xxx  (fig. 1a) in murine
myeloid 32d cells. expression of the different  xxxg529xxx  forms
was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis (fig. 1b). g-csfinduced activation of  xxxg2216xxx , as determined by its tyrosine
phosphorylation, was enhanced significantly and protracted in
cells transfected with the  xxxd715xxx  mutant lacking the carboxy

expressed in some patients with aml/scn (fig. 2).  xxxg2216xxx 
activation mediated by the ma mutant, in which the three
carboxy terminal tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine, was extended but not augmented. notably, the  xxxd715xxx  and
the ma mutants also mediated prolonged (but not enhanced)
activation of akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2. these data indicate that the
carboxy terminal tyrosine residues of the  xxxg529xxx  are implicated in regulating the duration of g-csf-stimulated signaling
pathways.
activation of  xxxg2216xxx , akt, and  xxxg1369xxx /2 is known to promote
cell survival [28 –32]. sustained and augmented activation of
 xxxg2216xxx  by the  xxxd715xxx  mutant has been shown to protect ba/f3
cells from apoptosis induced by g-csf withdrawal [7]. we
compared the survival of 32d cells expressing the different
receptor forms upon g-csf withdrawal. cells were pulsed with
g-csf for 8 h prior to incubation in medium containing no
growth factors. as compared with the wt receptor, the  xxxd715xxx 
mutant and the ma mutant markedly and moderately, respectively, prolonged the survival of 32d cells (fig. 2b). the
relative inefficiency of the ma mutant in suppressing apoptosis

is likely a result of the fact that unlike the  xxxd715xxx  mutant, the
ma mutant did not mediate enhanced  xxxg2216xxx  activation. 32d
cells expressing the different  xxxg529xxx  forms, which were
maintained in  xxxg1177xxx , died at comparable rates upon deprivation
of growth factors (data not shown).
to determine which carboxy terminal tyrosine residue(s) of
the  xxxg529xxx  are involved in controlling the duration of gcsf-activated signaling pathways, we compared  xxxg2216xxx  activation by g-csf in 32d cells expressing the  xxxg529xxx  mutants
that contained single or double tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions.  xxxg2216xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of its dna binding activity in response to g-csf were
significantly prolonged when tyr 729 was mutated to phenylalanine (fig. 3, a and b). in contrast, substitution of tyr 744
and/or y764 had no significant effect on  xxxg2216xxx  activation.
mutation of tyr 729 also significantly prolonged the activation
of akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 by g-csf. it appeared that prolongation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by ma and y729/764f mutants was less
significant than that by the y729f and y729/744f mutant
(figs. 2a and 3a), presumably, as tyr 764 plays an important
role in the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by g-csf [26, 27]. upon

western blotting using the phospho-specific antibodies. the membranes were reprobed with antibodies to  xxxg2216xxx , akt, and  xxxg1369xxx /2. (b) survival of 32d cells upon

g-csf withdrawal, 32d cells expressing the y729f mutant
(32d/y729f) died at a rate almost identical to that of 32d/ma
cells (fig. 2b). in addition to 32d cells,  xxxg2216xxx  activation was
more sustained in ba/f3 cells expressing the y729f mutant
than in cells expressing the wt  xxxg529xxx  (fig. 3c). together,
these data established that tyr 729 is critical for regulating the
duration of g-csf-activated signaling pathways.

to investigate the mechanism by which tyr 729 of the
 xxxg529xxx  down-regulates receptor signaling, we first determined whether de novo protein synthesis was required for the
negative regulation. to this end, 32d cells expressing the wt
 xxxg529xxx  (32d/wt) were pretreated with rna synthesis inhibitor  xxxd1800xxx  d or protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide prior to g-csf stimulation. pretreatment of cells with

with g-csf after starvation in serum-free medium for 4 h. (a) activation of  xxxg2216xxx , akt, and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in 32d cells was examined by immunoblotting with the

32d cells was assessed by emsa using the ␤-casein probe. (c) activation of  xxxg2216xxx  in ba/f3 cells was determined by immunoblotting with the phospho-specific
 xxxg2216xxx  antibody. the membrane was reprobed for  xxxg2216xxx .

 xxxd1800xxx  d or cyclohexamide dramatically prolonged the
duration of g-csf-stimulated activation of  xxxg2216xxx , akt, and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 (fig. 4).  xxxd1800xxx  d and cyclohexamide had no
apparent effect on the magnitudes of their activation. these
results indicated that de novo protein synthesis is required for
prompt attenuation of g-csf-stimulated signaling pathways.
at least three types of inhibitory molecules have been implicated in the negative regulation of cytokine receptor signaling: protein tyrosine phosphatases, the protein inhibitors of
activated stats, and the socs proteins [33]. in particular, the
socs family proteins are induced rapidly upon cytokine stimulation [34]. the potential involvement of the four well-characterized socs family members, i.e., socs1, socs2, socs3,
and cis, in the regulation of g-csf signaling was investigated
by transient expression of these proteins in 293t cells together
with the wt  xxxg529xxx . g-csf-stimulated  xxxg2216xxx  activation was
completely suppressed upon expression of socs1 or socs3
(fig. 5). the inhibitory effect of socs1 and socs3 was also
seen even when the two socs proteins were expressed at
barely detectable levels (data not shown). in contrast, expression of cis or socs2 did not inhibit or even potentiated
g-csf-stimulated activation of  xxxg2216xxx . these results indicate
that socs1 and socs3 play a negative role in the regulation
of g-csf signal transduction.
northern blot analysis was then used to determine whether
socs1 and socs3 were induced by g-csf in 32d cells
expressing the different forms of the  xxxg529xxx . g-csf treatment of 32d/wt cells resulted in rapid induction of socs3
and socs1 transcripts (fig. 6). the transcripts for socs3 and
socs1 started to increase as early as 15 min after g-csf
stimulation and reached peak levels by 30 min and 45 min,
respectively. notably, induction of socs3 and socs1 by
g-csf was somewhat delayed in 32d/ xxxd715xxx  and 32d/y729f
cells, and maximal levels were reached at ⬃45 min for socs3
and 60 min for socs1, suggesting that tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx

is required for prompt induction of socs3 and socs1 expression.
we further examined whether the carboxy terminal tyrosine
residues of the  xxxg529xxx  were required for the negative effect
of socs1 and socs3 on  xxxg2216xxx  activation. 293t cells were
transiently transfected with socs1 and socs3 expression
constructs together with the constructs for the wt  xxxg529xxx  or
the different mutants containing single tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions. although socs1 and socs3 completely
blocked  xxxg2216xxx  activation mediated by the wt  xxxg529xxx  or the
mutants that contained y704f, y744f, or y764f mutation, the
inhibitory effect of socs1 and socs3 on  xxxg2216xxx  activation was
attenuated when tyr 729 was mutated (fig. 7). these data
demonstrate that tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  is critical for efficient
inhibition of g-csf-stimulated  xxxg2216xxx  activity by socs1 and
socs3.
the effects of socs1 and socs3 on g-csf-stimulated cell
proliferation were then examined in ba/f3 cells expressing the
wt  xxxg529xxx  (baf/wt) or the y729f mutant (baf/y729f).
cells were transiently transfected with the empty vector or the
socs1 or socs3 expression construct. the transfection efficiency, as determined by expression of a cotransfected green
fluorescence protein construct, was ⬃50% (data not shown).
cell proliferation in response to g-csf was examined by mts
uptake assay. expression of socs1 or socs3 inhibited gcsf-dependent proliferation of baf/wt cells (fig. 8). it is
notable that the inhibitory effect of the two socs proteins was
significantly weaker in baf/y729f cells than in baf/wt cells,
indicating that effective inhibition of g-csf-dependent cell
proliferation by socs1 and socs3 requires tyr 729 of the
 xxxg529xxx .

carboxy terminal truncation of the  xxxg529xxx , as seen in patients with aml/scn, leads to augmented and prolonged activation of  xxxg2216xxx  by g-csf, suggesting that the carboxy terminus of the  xxxg529xxx  negatively regulates  xxxg2216xxx  activation. it has

(a) 32d cells expressing the wt,  xxxd715xxx , and y729f forms of the

following starvation in serum-free medium for 4 h. total rna
extracted from the cells was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel,

terminal region of the  xxxg529xxx  but not the tyrosine residues
located in this region is required for the inhibitory action of
 xxxg1895xxx  [21]. in this paper, we have investigated the mechanism
by which the carboxy terminus of the  xxxg529xxx  regulates the
duration of  xxxg2216xxx  activation. here, we provide the first evidence
that tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  controls the duration but not the
intensity of g-csf-stimulated  xxxg2216xxx  activation. we also demonstrate that socs1 and socs3 attenuate  xxxg529xxx  signaling,
and tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  is required for the maximal
inhibitory effects of socs1 and socs3.
our results are consistent with recent studies showing that
socs3 binds to tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  and inhibits statdependent luciferase activity stimulated by g-csf [35–37].

fig. 7. requirement of tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  for socs1- and socs3mediated inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  activation. 293t cells were transiently transfected
with stat5a expression construct and the expression constructs for the wt and
the different tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution forms of the  xxxg529xxx 
together with constructs for socs1, socs3, or empty vector. g-csf-induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  was examined by western blotting using the
phospho-specific anti- xxxg2216xxx  antibody. expression of socs1 and socs3 was
determined using the anti-flag antibody.

however, these studies did not examine  xxxg2216xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation and dna binding activity in hematopoietic cells,
and therefore, it remains unknown as to which aspects of  xxxg2216xxx 
activation are affected by socs3. the data presented here
strongly suggest that socs3 and socs1 control the duration,
but not the magnitude, of  xxxg2216xxx  activation in hematopoietic
cells. it appears that tyr 729 controls the functions of socs3
and socs1 by at least two distinct mechanisms. removal of

fig. 8. effects of socs1 and socs3 on g-csf-dependent proliferation.
baf/wt and baf/y729f cells were transiently transfected with the empty
vector (ctr) or expression constructs for socs1 and socs3. six hours after
transfection, cells were washed and incubated in triplicate in serum-free
medium for 24 h in the presence of g-csf (20 ng/ml). cells were then pulsed
with mts for 2 h, and mts uptake was determined. data are presented as
percentage (mean⫾sd) of mts uptake by cells transfected with the empty
vector. comparable results were obtained in three independent experiments.
the differences in the rate of inhibition by socs1 and socs3 are statistically
significant between baf/wt and baf/y729f cells (student’s t-test; p⬍0.01).

socs3 and socs1 transcripts by g-csf but also diminishes
the negative effect of socs3 and socs1 on  xxxg2216xxx  activation.
thus, tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  regulates the rates at which
socs3 and socs1 are up-regulated by g-csf and the efficacies with which the two socs proteins inhibit  xxxg529xxx  signaling. conceivably, mutation of tyr 729 causes prolonged
 xxxg529xxx  signaling by disrupting both negative regulatory
mechanisms.
in addition to deregulated  xxxg2216xxx  activation, carboxy terminal
truncation of the  xxxg529xxx  results in sustained activation of
akt by g-csf [38, 39]. our results indicate that tyr 729 of the
 xxxg529xxx  is critically involved in controlling the duration of
g-csf-stimulated activation of akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2. activation of
akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 by g-csf was also prolonged upon inhibition
of protein or rna synthesis, suggesting that socs1 and
socs3 may also exert a negative effect on the activation of akt
and  xxxg1369xxx /2. indeed, expression of socs1 or socs3 in 293t
cells attenuated g-csf-induced akt phosphorylation (data not
shown). it is likely that socs1 and socs3 may target a
common upstream component of the  xxxg2216xxx , akt, and  xxxg1369xxx /2
pathways, although one cannot exclude the possibility that the
two socs proteins may directly inhibit the activation of individual components within the three pathways. as the jak and
src family kinases are differentially required for g-csf-stimulated activation of  xxxg2216xxx  and akt, respectively [38], one potential, common target of socs1 and socs3 is the  xxxg529xxx .
in support of this, we have observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the  xxxg529xxx  induced by g-csf was completely
blocked upon expression of socs1 or socs3 in 293t cells
(data not shown).
a recent study showed that cis was also up-regulated by
g-csf and bound to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyr
729 and tyr 744 of the g- xxxg525xxx  [40]. however, we consistently
observed that expression of cis enhanced  xxxg2216xxx  activation by
g-csf in 293t cells, consistent with the report by van de
geijn et al. [37]. it remains to be determined, with respect to
the relative contribution of socs1 and socs3 to the attenuation of  xxxg529xxx  signaling and the precise mechanism by
which the two socs proteins down-regulate the activation of
g-csf-stimulated pathways. in addition to tyr 729, socs3
has been shown to bind to tyr 704 of the  xxxg529xxx  with a
reduced affinity [35], which may explain the partial inhibitory
effect of socs3 on  xxxg2216xxx  activation mediated by the y729f
mutant. in contrast to socs3, it is generally believed that
socs1 inhibits cytokine receptor signaling via interacting
directly with the jak family kinases but not with the cytokine
receptors [34, 41]. in fact, it has been shown that socs1 fails
to bind to any of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues including
tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  [35]. we also have been unable to
detect any interaction between socs1 and the  xxxg529xxx  (unpublished data). however, our data clearly show that tyr 729
of the  xxxg529xxx  is required for the maximal inhibitory effect of
socs1 on g-csf-stimulated  xxxg2216xxx  activation. whether socs1
may interact indirectly with tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  remains
to be examined.
regardless of the mechanisms whereby socs3 and socs1
exert their negative effect on  xxxg529xxx  signaling, the results
presented here together with the previously report [21] demonstrate that the intensity and duration of g-csf-stimulated

is constitutively expressed in myeloid
cells and controls the magnitude of
 xxxg2216xxx  activation via interacting with the
carboxy terminus of the  xxxg529xxx .
carboxy terminal tyrosine residues of
the receptor appear dispensable for
 xxxg1895xxx  action [21, 22]. socs3 and
socs1 are up-regulated rapidly by
signals transduced from the  xxxg529xxx 
and control the duration of  xxxg2216xxx  activation. tyr 729 of the  xxxg529xxx  is required for the maximal inhibitory activities of socs3 and socs1.

 xxxg2216xxx  activation are regulated by at least two distinct regulatory
mechanisms, i.e., the one mediated by  xxxg1895xxx , which reduces
the magnitude of  xxxg2216xxx  activation, and the one mediated by
socs3 and/or socs1, which controls the duration of  xxxg2216xxx 
activation (fig. 9). to our knowledge, such a regulatory feature
has not been reported for other cytokine receptors. additionally, our data reveal an important molecular mechanism that
explains, at least in part, why truncation of the carboxy terminal region of the  xxxg529xxx  leads to prolonged receptor signaling and may thus contribute to leukemogenesis.
