two migraine patients were studied by in vivo spect using the dopamine d2-receptor
specific radioligand 123i-3-iodo-6-methoxybenzamide (123i-ibzm) during ergotamine abuse
and after withdrawal. results were compared with 15 healthy controls. striatum/cerebellum
and striatum/occipital cortex ratios of count rate density were calculated as a
semiquantitative measurement for striatal dopamine d2-receptor binding potential. no
differences were found in striatal uptake of 123i-ibzm between healthy controls and the
patients when on or off ergotamine. preliminary evidence suggests that ergotamine may not
occupy striatal dopamine d2-receptors to a large extent and thus may not cross the blood
brain barrier in large quantities • dopamine d2, ergotami ne, migraine, receptor,

for decades,  xxxd2022xxx  has been used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. there is,
however, much debate as to its mechanism of  xxxd2022xxx  action. neuronal inhibition at the trigeminal nerve
(1), vasoconstriction (2), and interaction with receptors in the brainstem (3) have been suggested. in the last
mentioned mechanism, it is necessary for ergotamine to cross the blood brain barrier, but this is controversial
(4).
ergotamine interacts with dopamine d2-, a2-, a1-, and serotonin receptors (5, 6), and with glutamate
uptake sites (7). the affinity of ergotamine for d2-receptors is considerable and it has agonistic properties
(8-13). dopamine d2-receptor upregulation may be important in causing symptoms after withdrawal of
ergotamine in migraine patients who abuse ergotamine (14).
occupancy of dopamine d2-receptors by ergotamine and d2-receptor upregulation after withdrawal can
be monitored in vivo by dopamine d2-receptor imaging using single photon emission computed tomography
(spect) and [123](s)-n[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)] methyl-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxybenzamide (123i-ibzm),
a dopamine d2-receptor specific ligand suitable for spect in man (15,16).
in the present study we estimated striatal dopamine d2-receptor binding potential in vivo with 123i-ibzm
spect in two migraine patients during abuse of ergotamine and after withdrawal. the data were compared
with those obtained in healthy volunteers.
subjects, materials and methods

two patients who used more than five doses per week of ergotamine participated in this study. the first
patient was a 48-year-old man suffering from migraine without aura for 13 years. he had been taking oral
ergotamine for 10 years and was using seven suppositories of 2 mg ergotamine combined with 100 mg
caffeine weekly for 1.5 years. he took his last dose of ergotamine 20 min prior to the first spect study. the
second patient was a 46-year-old woman suffering from migraine without aura for 29 years. she had been
taking ergotamine for 7 years and had been using 18 suppositories of ergotamine weekly for the last 2 years.
she took her last dose of ergotamine 45 min prior to the first spect study. a spect study was repeated 14
and 15 weeks after acute inpatient ergotamine withdrawal in the first and second patient, respectively. the
data were compared with 15 healthy volunteers (9m, 6f; age 19-64 years), without medication, psychiatric or
other medical history. approval was obtained from the medical ethics committee at the academic medical
centre in amsterdam. all subjects participated in the study after having given written informed consent.

for spect, the strichman medical equipment type 810 multidetector camera was used. the full width half
maximum of a 99mtc line source in air had been measured as 6 mm. from 0 to 60 min after injection (p.i.) of
157-219 mbq 123i-ibzm (spec. act. 192-259 mbq/nmol; generously donated by cygne b.v., technical university
eindhoven, the netherlands), dynamic spect was performed (energy window 135-190 kev, 5 min/slice, 12 mm
slice thickness) at the level of the striatum, i.e. 4 cm above and parallel to the canthomeatal line (cml). from 120
to 180 min p.i., multislice spect was performed with 10 mm spacing from level cml + 0 cm to cml + 11 cm.
fixed regions of interest (rois) were placed over the striatum (s) for total binding and over the occipital cortex
(o) for nonspecific binding. the roi for the s was based on a stereotactic brain atlas (17), whereas the roi for
the o was derived from a brain atlas for computerized tomography (18). the d2-receptor density in the o is
expected to be the lowest of all cortical parts (19). the cerebellum (c) was defined as a second roi for
nonspecific binding on the multislice scan, using the 50% isocontour line. s/o and s/c ratios were calculated as a
semiquantitative estimation of the d2-receptor binding potential.
results

no significant differences could be visualized between occupancy of dopamine d2-receptors in the two migraine
patients when on ergotamine or when off ergotamine for 3.5 months (figs. 1a and 2a), compared to healthy
controls (figs. 1b and 2b).
the s/o ratios resulting from the dynamic 123i-ibzm spect (fig. 3) and the s/o and s/c ratios resulting from
the multislice spect (table 1) were also not significantly different between patients on and off ergotamine and did
not differ from those

45-year-old female, respectively; individual values). no
difference
between the ratios can be observed.

discussion

we did not observe occupancy of striatal dopamine d2-receptors by ergotamine in vivo. this may have resulted
from: (1) insufficient sensitivity of the technique used to detect small degrees of d2-receptor occupancy or (2) poor
penetration of the blood brain barrier by ergotamine.
using 123i-ibzm spect, marked dopamine d2-receptor occupancies have been detected in patients with
schizophrenia using classical antipsychotics (i5, 16) and clozapine (20). the dopamine d2-receptor affinity in vitro
is 3.2 nm for ergotamine (i3), but only 100 nm for clozapine (2i). 123i-ibzm spect should therefore show relevant
dopamine d2-receptor occupancy by ergotamine. the lack of this suggests that ergotamine crosses the blood
brain barrier only poorly.
the presence of functional dopamine d2-receptors on cerebral blood vessels has been assumed (22).
therefore an action of ergotamine on dopamine

d2-receptors on cerebral blood vessels may contribute to its effects in patients with migraine. on the other hand, the presence of
d2-receptors on blood vessels is unclear from receptor binding studies (23), and remains to be determined.
we conclude that ergotamine in humans may not occupy striatal dopamine d2-receptors in vivo to a marked extent, probably
because of its poor penetrations of the blood brain barrier. therefore, a central action of ergotamine is unlikely to explain its therapeutic
benefit.
