abstract
a novel antidiabetic agent,  xxxd2702xxx , is a  xxxd1793xxx 
derivative lacking either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety.
we examined with the patch-clamp method the effect of  xxxd2702xxx  on recombinant atp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293t cells transfected with
a  xxxg1250xxx  subunit and either of a sulfonylurea receptor (sur) 1,
sur2a, and sur2b. in inside-out patches,  xxxd2702xxx  reversibly inhibited the spontaneous openings of all three types of
sur/ xxxg1250xxx  channels.  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels with high and low affinities (ki ⫽ 75 nm and 114 ␮m) but
sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channels only with low affinity
(ki ⫽ 105 and 111 ␮m, respectively).  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited the
katp current mediated by  xxxg1250xxx  lacking c-terminal 26 amino
acids only with low affinity (ki ⫽ 290 ␮m) in the absence of

atp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels are inhibited by intracellular atp and activated by adp and thus provide a link
between the cellular metabolic state and excitability (ashcroft, 1988; terzic et al., 1995). these channels are associated
with such cellular functions as insulin secretion, cardiac preconditioning, vasodilatation, and neuroprotection (ashcroft,
1988; terzic et al., 1995; nichols et al., 1996; quayle et al.,
1997; yamada et al., 2001; miki et al., 2002). katp channels
are composed of an atp-binding cassette protein, sulfonylurea receptor (sur), and an inwardly rectifying k⫹ channel
(kir) subunit, kir6.0 (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995; inagaki et
al., 1995, 1996, 1997; sakura et al., 1995; clement et al.,
this work was supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research on priority
areas (b) from the ministry of education, culture, sports and science of
japan.
in preparation of this manuscript, hansen et al. (2002) reported that  xxxd2702xxx  inhibits  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels with the half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 800 nm and that this inhibition is abolished by the s1237y
mutation of  xxxg19xxx , consistent with our present observations.

sur. replacement of serine at position 1237 of  xxxg19xxx  to tyrosine [ xxxg19xxx (s1237y)] specifically abolished the high-affinity
inhibition of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels by  xxxd2702xxx . mgadp or
mgudp (100 ␮m) augmented the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2702xxx 
on  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  but not  xxxg19xxx (s1237y)/ xxxg1250xxx  or sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx 
channels. this augmenting effect of mgadp was also observed
with the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx (k185q) channel, which was not inhibited
by mgadp, but not with the  xxxg19xxx (k1384a)/ xxxg1250xxx  channel,
which was not activated by mgadp. these results indicate that
therapeutic concentrations of  xxxd2702xxx  (⬃10 ␮m) may selectively inhibit pancreatic type  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels through
 xxxg19xxx , especially when the channel is activated by intracellular
mgadp, even though the agent does not contain either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety.

1997; shyng and nichols, 1997). detailed functional analyses
of katp channels composed of kir6.0 and either of three types
of sur ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a, and sur2b) indicate that  xxxg19xxx ,
sur2a, and sur2b represent pancreatic, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle types of sur, respectively (aguilarbryan et al., 1995; inagaki et al., 1995, 1996; isomoto et al.,
1996; yamada et al., 1997).  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , and
sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channels exhibit the same single-channel conductance but different responses to k⫹ channel openers and
mgadp because sur regulates the channel’s gating in response to these substances (inagaki et al., 1995, 1996; isomoto et al., 1996; matsuoka et al., 2000).
sur types also determine the response of katp channels to
sulfonylurea and benzamido derivatives (gribble et al.,
1998b). sulfonylurea derivatives  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2202xxx 
provoke selective high-affinity inhibition of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
channels (gribble et al., 1998b; gribble and ashcroft, 1999).
however,  xxxd2215xxx  containing both sulfonylurea and
benzamido moieties, and meglitinide possessing a benzamido
but not a sulfonylurea moiety, provoke high-affinity inhibi-

materials and methods
molecular biology. the cdnas of mouse  xxxg1250xxx  and different
surs were used (isomoto et al., 1996; matsuoka et al., 2000). the
coding region of each cdna was individually subcloned into expression vector pcdna3 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca).  xxxg19xxx  whose serine
at position 1237 was substituted with tyrosine [ xxxg19xxx (s1237y)],
 xxxg19xxx  whose lysine at position 1384 was substituted with alanine
[ xxxg19xxx (k1384a)], and  xxxg1250xxx  whose lysine at position 185 was substituted with glutamine [ xxxg1250xxx (k185q)] were constructed using the
geneeditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (promega,
madison, wi).  xxxg1250xxx  whose c-terminal 26 amino acids were truncated ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26) was made by introducing a stop codon at the
appropriate position by site-directed mutagenesis (tucker et al.,
1997). the nucleotide sequence of all mutated  xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx , and
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26 genes was confirmed by dna sequencing.
functional coexpression of surs and  xxxg1250xxx  cdnas. using
lipofectamine (invitrogen), human embryonic kidney (hek) 293t
cells were transfected simultaneously with the plasmid containing
 xxxg1250xxx , a plasmid containing either  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b, and
pca-gfp (s65a) bearing a gene for green fluorescence protein
(gfp). the plasmid containing  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26 was transfected into
hek293t cells alone with pca-gfp (s65a). the cells expressing
gfp were identified by fluorescence microscopy and used for electrophysiology.
electrophysiology. the currents through katp channels expressed in the transfected hek293t cells were recorded with patchclamp techniques using an axopatch 200a amplifier (axon instruments, foster city, ca). patch pipettes were fabricated from
borosilicate capillaries, and their tips were coated with sylgard (dow
corning, midland, mi) and heat-polished. pipettes were filled with
solution containing 145 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, and 5
mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4). the bath was perfused with modified
tyrode’s solution containing 136.5 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1.8 mm
cacl2, 0.53 mm mgcl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5.5 mm hepes-naoh
(ph 7.4). after formation of the cell-attached configuration, the bath
was perfused with “internal” solution containing 145 mm kcl, 5 mm
egta, 2 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.3). the concen-

tration of free mg2⫹ in this solution was 1.4 mm. after patch excision, the internal side of the patch membrane was perfused with the
internal solution containing nucleotides and/or drugs. when nucleotides were added to the internal solution, the free mg2⫹ concentration was adjusted to 1.4 mm by supplementing mgcl2.  xxxg1253xxx 
currents in inside-out patch membranes were recorded at ⫺60 mv at
room temperature (25°c). the data were recorded on videocassette
tapes through a pcm converter (vr-10b; instrutech, port washington, ny). for analysis, the stored data were reproduced through
the same pcm converter, low pass-filtered at 1 khz (⫺3 db) with an
eight-pore bassel filter (frequency devices, haverhill, ma), digitized at 5 khz with an ad converter (itc16; instrutech), and
analyzed on a personal computer (power macintosh g3; apple, cupertino, ca) using commercially available software (patch analyst
pro; mt corporation, hyogo, japan).
data analysis. the channel activity was estimated by measuring
a mean current amplitude or npo (n is the number of functional
channels and po is the open probability of each channel). the channel
activity in the presence of  xxxd2702xxx  was expressed as a fraction of
the channel activity recorded in the absence of the drug (relative
channel activity).  xxxd2702xxx  concentration-response curves were fit
with the following equations according to gribble et al. (1998b).

channels (gribble et al., 1998b; ashfield et al., 1999). therefore,
some of the compounds used as hypoglycemic agents may cause
an adverse cardiovascular effect by cross-reacting with cardiovascular katp channels (bernauer, 1997; cleveland et al., 1997;
uk prospective diabetes study group, 1998).
the phenylalanine derivative  xxxd2702xxx  (n-[(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl)-carbonyl]- xxxd1793xxx ;  xxxd2702xxx ) is a
novel oral hypoglycemic agent. although  xxxd2702xxx  lacks
either a sulfonylurea or a benzamido moiety (akiyoshi et al.,
1995; ikenoue et al., 1997; gribble et al., 2001), it stimulates
insulin secretion by inhibiting ␤-cell katp channels. however, its effects on distinct types of katp channels have not
been examined in detail. in this study, we compared the
effects of  xxxd2702xxx  on  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , and
sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channels with the patch-clamp method. we
show that  xxxd2702xxx  provokes selective, reversible, highaffinity inhibition of the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel through the
same site on  xxxg19xxx  as  xxxd3394xxx . intracellular mgadp
apparently enhances the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2702xxx  because  xxxd2702xxx  suppresses the stimulatory but not inhibitory effect of the nucleotide on the channel. this is the first
report to show that a compound lacking a sulfonylurea moiety exhibits the same mode of action as sulfonylurea derivatives. a part of this study has been published in an abstract
form (chachin et al., 2002).

and ashcroft, 1999; reimann et al., 2001). figure 2a shows
the effect of  xxxd2702xxx  on channel currents mediated by a
 xxxg1250xxx  subunit whose c-terminal 26 amino acids had been
removed ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26) and which forms active katp channels
in the absence of sur (tucker et al., 1997).  xxxd2702xxx 
inhibited  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26 channel currents that were recorded in
the absence of a sur only at high concentrations (⬎10 ␮m).
the complete concentration-response relationship for this
reaction could not be obtained because ⬎300 ␮m of the drug
could not be dissolved in water. the fitting of eq. 4 to the
available data suggested a ki2 value of 290 ␮m. this value
was of the same order as those obtained for the low-affinity
inhibition of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx 
channels by  xxxd2702xxx , suggesting that the low-affinity site
resides on the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit.

 xxxd2702xxx  to the intracellular side of patch membranes
reversibly inhibited  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel currents by 35.3 ⫾

(n ⫽ 5) and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channel currents (n ⫽ 4) in a
concentration-dependent manner only at concentrations
higher than 10 ␮m. the relationship between the  xxxd2702xxx 
concentration and the normalized amplitude of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx

only with low affinity with ki2 of 105 and 111 ␮m, respectively (eqs. 3 and 4 under materials and methods) (fig. 1, b
and c, right column). thus,  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited the pancreatic type of  xxxg1253xxx  ( xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx ) with high affinity,

currents more strongly in the presence of mgadp than in its
absence.
to examine whether the potentiation by mgadp of the
effect of  xxxd2702xxx  upon  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  was related to the
high-affinity site for the drug, we repeated the experiment
using  xxxg19xxx (s1237y)/ xxxg1250xxx  channels (fig. 3b). in this case,
mgadp (100 ␮m) increased the channel current both in the
absence and presence of  xxxd2702xxx  (100 ␮m).  xxxd2702xxx 
(10 ␮m) inhibited the channel current by 21.3 ⫾ 5.3 and
20.5 ⫾ 7.6% in the absence and presence of 100 ␮m mgadp,
respectively (fig. 3d) (p ⫽ 0.94). therefore, the potentiating
effect of mgadp required the interaction of  xxxd2702xxx  with
the serine at position 1237 of  xxxg19xxx  and not with the  xxxg1250xxx 
subunit. consistent with this notion,  xxxd2702xxx  (100 ␮m)
did not inhibit sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  channel currents even in the
presence of mgadp (100 ␮m) (fig. 3c), and mgadp did not
potentiate the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2702xxx  (10 and 100

[ xxxg19xxx (s1237y)] abolishes the high-affinity inhibition of
 xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels by  xxxd3394xxx  (ashfield et al., 1999).
thus, we examined the effect of this mutation on the action of
 xxxd2702xxx  (fig. 2b).  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited  xxxg19xxx (s1237y)/
 xxxg1250xxx  channel currents only with low-affinity (ki2 ⫽ 72 ␮m),
indicating that the same amino acid residue in  xxxg19xxx  mediates

effect of intracellular mgadp on  xxxd2702xxx -induced inhibition of katp channels. it is known that
intracellular mgadp enhances inhibition of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
channel currents by  xxxd3394xxx  (zünkler et al., 1988;
schwanstecher et al., 1992; gribble et al., 1997a, 1998b).
because the same amino acid residue in  xxxg19xxx  mediates the
high-affinity inhibition of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels by  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx , we examined whether the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2702xxx  was also augmented by mgadp (fig.
3a). mgadp (100 ␮m) increased opening of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
channels in the absence of  xxxd2702xxx  but decreased them in
the presence of 10 ␮m  xxxd2702xxx  (fig. 3a). whereas 10 ␮m
 xxxd2702xxx  inhibited  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel currents by
53.9 ⫾ 4.0% in the absence of mgadp, in its presence the
drug inhibited the currents by 86.1 ⫾ 0.9% (fig. 3d) (p ⫽

chachin et al.

83.8 ⫾ 3.8% in the absence and presence of mgadp, respectively (fig. 4d). this difference was statistically significant
(p ⫽ 0.008).
next, we examined whether mgudp also potentiated the
effect of  xxxd2702xxx . this nucleotide in particularly interesting because mgudp stimulates but does not inhibit  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg1250xxx  channels (fig. 4b). mgudp (100 ␮m) strongly increased the channel current in the absence of  xxxd2702xxx  but
not in the presence of 10 ␮m of the agent.  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel currents by 56.6 ⫾ 4.3 and 81.1 ⫾
4.7% in the absence and presence of mgudp, respectively
(fig. 4d) (p ⫽ 0.018).
taken together, these results indicate that  xxxd2702xxx 
abolished the stimulatory effects of the nucleotides on katp
channel currents. this effect may then be sufficient to account for the apparent potentiating effect of mgadp on the
inhibition of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels by  xxxd2702xxx .
to test this hypothesis, we used  xxxg19xxx  where lysine 1384 in
the walker a motif in nucleotide binding domain 2 was
substituted with alanine [ xxxg19xxx (k1384a)] (fig. 4c). this
mutation extinguishes mgadp-induced activation of  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg1250xxx  channels (gribble et al., 1997b). mgadp (100 ␮m) inhibited  xxxg19xxx (k1384a)/ xxxg1250xxx  channels by 58.2 ⫾ 8.6 and 69.7 ⫾

inhibitory effects on  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels (gribble et al.,
1997b). the former effect is mediated by  xxxg19xxx , whereas the
latter is mediated by  xxxg1250xxx  (gribble et al., 1997b). figure 3a
indicates that the stimulatory effect of the nucleotide dominated the inhibitory effect in the absence of  xxxd2702xxx  but
vice versa in the presence of the drug. we therefore examined
the effect of  xxxd2702xxx  on the separate stimulatory and
inhibitory effects of the nucleotide.
first, we examined the effects of mgadp and  xxxd2702xxx 
on katp channels composed of  xxxg19xxx  and a  xxxg1250xxx  whose
lysine at position 185 was substituted to glutamine
[ xxxg1250xxx (k185q)]. this mutation reduces the sensitivity of
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26 channels to mgatp by ⬃40 times (tucker et al.,
1998), and mgatp (1 mm) did not inhibit but stimulated
 xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx (k185q) channel currents (fig. 4a). this is
probably because attenuation of the inhibitory effect of
mgatp on the kir subunit revealed the stimulating effect of
the nucleotide acting through  xxxg19xxx  (gribble et al., 1998a;
bienengraeber et al., 2000). mgadp (100 ␮m) strongly increased  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx (k185q) channel currents in the absence of  xxxd2702xxx  but had little effect in the presence of 10
␮m of the drug. this indicated that  xxxd2702xxx  had abolished
the stimulatory effect of mgadp.  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited
 xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx (k185q) channel currents by 59.6 ⫾ 4.0 and

 xxxd2702xxx  selectively inhibits pancreatic  xxxg1253xxx 

spectively (n ⫽ 4).  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited  xxxg19xxx (k1384a)/ xxxg1250xxx 
channel currents by 60.5 ⫾ 6.3 and 71.2 ⫾ 3.8% in the absence
and presence of mgadp, respectively (fig. 4d). this difference
was not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.22). thus,  xxxd2702xxx  did
not affect the inhibitory effect of mgadp, and mgadp did not
affect the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2702xxx .
in conclusion, these results show that inhibition of  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg1250xxx  channels was enhanced by the addition of mgadp to
 xxxd2702xxx  because the drug abolished the stimulatory effect
of the nucleotide. the thus isolated inhibitory effect of the
nucleotide was then added to that of the drug.

discussion

meglitinide (ashfield et al., 1999). this mutation also abolishes the binding of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  to membranes expressing  xxxg19xxx  (ashfield et al., 1999). because  xxxd2215xxx 
bears both sulfonylurea and benzamido moieties, it is likely
that s1237 forms an essential part of the binding site for
sulfonylurea derivatives. it would therefore seem that  xxxd2702xxx  inhibits  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels through the same site
as sulfonylurea derivatives, even though it lacks a sulfonylurea moiety. interestingly,  xxxd2702xxx  was a much more
potent inhibitor of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels than  xxxd3394xxx 
and as potent as another sulfonylurea derivative,  xxxd2202xxx 
(gribble et al., 1998b; gribble and ashcroft, 1999).  xxxd2654xxx  is another antidiabetic agent that lacks either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety but causes high-affinity inhibition
of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels that is abolished by the s1237y
mutation (reimann et al., 2001).  xxxd2654xxx  therefore resembles  xxxd2702xxx  in this regard. but  xxxd2654xxx  also inhibits
sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channels with high affinity, which must be mediated by a site on  xxxg20xxx  that is
different from the “sulfonylurea site” (reimann et al., 2001).
it is not clear at present how  xxxd2702xxx  interacts with the
sulfonylurea site on  xxxg19xxx . conformation analysis revealed
that hypoglycemic agents such as  xxxd2702xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,
 xxxd2203xxx , meglitinide,  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx , and s3075
with diverse molecular structures nevertheless display a
comparable u shape with hydrophobic cycles placed at the
extremity of each hand and a peptidic bond placed at the
bottom of u (lins et al., 1995). thus, molecular modeling of
the agents is unable to define the particular molecular structure of the interface between  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxg19xxx . the
molecular structure of  xxxg19xxx  needs to be identified to further
understand the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between  xxxd2702xxx  and  xxxg19xxx .
in conclusion, we have shown that  xxxd2702xxx  specifically
inhibits  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels with high affinity. although
 xxxd2702xxx  lacks a sulfonylurea moiety, its effect on  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg1250xxx  channels resembles that of  xxxd3394xxx  with respect
to the s1237y mutation and the interaction with intracellular mgadp.  xxxd2702xxx  was, however, much more potent
than  xxxd3394xxx . because  xxxd2702xxx  has a clinically useful
pharmacokinetic profile to compensate for the impaired first
phase insulin response and thus suppress postprandial hyperglycemia, this compound seems to be an effective antidiabetic agent with less undesirable extrapancreatic side effects.

 xxxd2702xxx  is a novel type of oral hypoglycemic agent that
does not contain either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety
(akiyoshi et al., 1995; ikenoue et al., 1997; gribble et al.,
2001). it was recently licensed and launched for therapy of
patients with type ii diabetes. we examined the effect of
 xxxd2702xxx  on  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/
 xxxg1250xxx  channels expressed in a mammalian cell line. we
found that  xxxd2702xxx  specifically inhibited  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
channels with high affinity. on the other hand, sunaga et al.
(2001) reported that less than 1 ␮m  xxxd2702xxx  partially
inhibited all  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx 
channels. although the reason for this discrepancy is not
clear, hu et al. (1999) reported that  xxxd2702xxx  inhibited
native katp channels in rat pancreatic ␤-cells ⬃100 times
more potently than those in the smooth muscle cells, consistent with our observation. oral hypoglycemic agents crossreacting with extrapancreatic katp channels potentially
cause undesirable side effects. indeed, it is still under dispute
whether sulfonylurea and benzamido derivatives increase
the risk of cardiovascular mortality (bernauer, 1997; cleveland et al., 1997; uk prospective diabetes study group,
1998). taking the therapeutic plasma concentration of  xxxd2702xxx  (⬃10 ␮m) into account, we conclude that  xxxd2702xxx 
would not cause detrimental cardiovascular side effects (hu
et al., 1999; gribble et al., 2001).
it is reported that physiological concentrations of mgadp
enhance the inhibitory effect of sulfonylurea derivatives on
native ␤-cell katp channels and reconstituted  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
channels but not sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  channels (zünkler et al.,
1988; schwanstecher et al., 1992; gribble et al., 1997a,
1998b). this was also the case for  xxxd2702xxx  (fig. 3, a and
c). this characteristic would further enhance the selectivity
of  xxxd2702xxx  for pancreatic katp channels. the cumulative
effects of  xxxd2702xxx  and mgadp upon the channels can be
explained as follows. mgadp has dualistic effects upon katp
channels, evoking both stimulation and/or inhibition (gribble
et al., 1997b).  xxxd2702xxx  inhibits  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels
and also suppresses the stimulatory effect of mgadp (fig.
4a). the inhibitory effect of mgadp is not affected by  xxxd2702xxx  (fig. 4c). both compounds then have inhibitory effects
and as a result, the channel activity becomes even smaller in
the presence of  xxxd2702xxx  and mgadp than in the presence
of  xxxd2702xxx  alone (fig. 4c).
the high-affinity inhibition of the channels by  xxxd2702xxx 
was eliminated by the s1237y mutation of  xxxg19xxx  (fig. 2a).
this mutation also abolishes the high-affinity inhibition of
 xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels by the sulfonylurea derivative  xxxd3394xxx , but not inhibition evoked by the benzamido derivative
