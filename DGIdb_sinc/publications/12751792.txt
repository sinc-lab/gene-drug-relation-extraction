testis-specific expression of the nuclear form of  xxxg946xxx  ( xxxg946xxx ).  the selenoprotein  xxxg946xxx  ( xxxg946xxx ) is present in at least three different isoforms in testis: as a cytosolic, as a mitochondrial, and as a nuclear protein. we have recently shown that a sperm nucleus-specific glutathione peroxidase ( xxxg946xxx ) is identical to the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of  xxxg946xxx  apart from its n-terminus. this arginine-rich n-terminus of  xxxg946xxx , reminiscent of protamines, is encoded by an alternative exon located in the first intron of the  xxxg946xxx  gene and is responsible for nuclear localisation and chromatin binding of  xxxg946xxx  [pfeifer et al., faseb j. 15 (2001), pp. 1236-1238]. by using a combination of techniques including selective cloning of mrna 5'-ends, rt-pcr, and s1 analyses, we provide evidence that the transcript encoding the nuclear form is generated by transcription initiation at an alternative promoter and not by alternative splicing. we show that the major transcription start region is located at -12 to -14 upstream of the aug translation initiation site of the sperm nucleus-specific exon and lacks a tata box. two minor tata-less transcription initiation sites are located at around -30 and -45. we have shown by in situ hybridisation that  xxxg946xxx  expression in testis, like protamine expression, is restricted to late stages of spermatogenesis whereas  xxxg946xxx  expression is only found in spermatocytes and early spermatids. these findings have to be taken into account when studying either the differential regulation of  xxxg946xxx  and  xxxg946xxx  expression in testis or the impact of putative mutations in  xxxg946xxx  on male fertility in man.
