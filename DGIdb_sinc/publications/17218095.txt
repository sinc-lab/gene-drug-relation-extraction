abstract
binding of 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  to the c-terminal domain (lbd) of its receptor (vdr), induces a conformational change that
enables interaction of vdr with transcriptional coactivators such as the members of the  xxxg1449xxx /src family or the drip ( xxxd2019xxx  interacting
complex)/mediator complex. these interactions are critical for vdr-mediated transcriptional enhancement of target genes. recent reports
indicate that nuclear receptors, including vdr, interact with  xxxg1449xxx /src members and the drip/mediator complex in a sequential, cyclical,
and mutually exclusive manner when bound to a target promoter, exhibiting also a high exchange rate. here, we present an overview of how
these coactivators are recruited to the bone-specific osteocalcin (oc) gene in response to short and long exposures to 1␣,25-dihydroxy vitamin
d3. we find that in intact osteoblastic cells vdr and  xxxg1510xxx  rapidly bind to the oc promoter in response to the ligand. this recruitment
correlates with transcriptional enhancement of the oc gene and with increased histone acetylation at the oc promoter. in contrast, binding of
the  xxxg1396xxx  subunit, which anchors the drip/mediator complex to the vdr, is detected at the oc promoter after several hours of incubation
with 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx . together, our results indicate that vdr preferentially recruits  xxxg1510xxx  to enhance basal bone-specific oc
gene transcription. we propose a model where specific protein–dna and protein–protein interactions that occur within the context of the oc
gene promoter in osteoblastic cells stabilize the preferential association of the vdr– xxxg1510xxx  complex.

1. introduction
1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  plays an important role in
bone metabolism by directly regulating the expression of
bone-related genes [1]. 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  exerts
its genomic effects through the 1␣,25-dihydroxy vitamin
 xxxg657xxx  (vdr) which is a member of the super family of nuclear receptors [2]. as for other nuclear receptors,
binding of the ligand induces conformational changes in
the c-terminal ligand binding domain (lbd) of vdr that
enable it to interact with co-activators of the  xxxg1449xxx /src family such as  xxxg1510xxx / xxxg1510xxx , src-2/ xxxg1511xxx /grip/ xxxg1511xxx ,
and  xxxg1512xxx / xxxg1512xxx  that are critical for transcriptional acti-

vation [1,2].  xxxg1449xxx /src coactivators form high molecular
weight complexes by interacting with other co-activator proteins such as p300, its related homologue cbp and  xxxg1227xxx 
[3]. moreover,  xxxg1449xxx /src coactivators have been shown
to recruit cbp/p300 and  xxxg1227xxx  to ligand-bound nuclear
receptors. these findings indicate that multiprotein complexes containing different activities are functionally linked
to ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation [2]. it has
been reported that coactivators such as  xxxg1512xxx / xxxg1512xxx , src1/ xxxg1510xxx , cbp/p300, and  xxxg1227xxx  contain intrinsic histone
acetyl transferase (hat) activity. therefore, protein complexes including independent hat activities can be recruited
to gene promoters by nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent
manner [2]. once bound to these promoters, the hat activities may contribute to chromatin remodelling events that
further increase access of additional regulatory factors to their
cognate elements [4].

the multisubunit drip (vdr-interacting protein) complex also binds to vdr in response to the ligand
1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  [5,6]. this interaction occurs
through the lbd of vdr in much the same manner as for
the  xxxg1449xxx /src co-activators, resulting also in transcriptional
enhancement [7]. in contrast to  xxxg1449xxx /src co-activators
drip is devoid of hat or another chromatin remodelling
activity and interacts with nuclear receptors through a single
subunit called  xxxg1396xxx , which anchors the other subunits
to the receptor lbd. several of these subunits are also
present in the mediator complex, which interacts with the cterminal domain (ctd) of the rna polymerase ii, forming
the holoenzyme complex [8]. therefore, the drip complex appears to function as a transcriptional co-activator by
forming a molecular bridge between the vdr and the basal
transcriptional machinery.

2. the osteocalcin gene as a model to study
1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -mediated
responsiveness
the rat osteocalcin (oc) gene encodes a 10 kda bonespecific protein that is induced in osteoblasts with the onset
of mineralization at late stages of differentiation [9]. transcription of the oc gene is controlled by modularly organized
basal and hormone-responsive elements (see fig. 2b), located
within a distal (−600 to −400) and proximal (−170 to −70)
promoter regions [10]. a key regulatory element that controls
oc gene expression is recognized by the 1␣,25-dihydroxy
vitamin  xxxg657xxx  (vdr) complex upon ligand stimulation. this 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  responsive element
(vdre) is located in the distal region (fig. 2b) of the oc promoter (positions −465 to −437) and functions as an enhancer
to increase oc gene transcription [11]. another key regulator
of the oc gene expression is the transcription factor runx2,
a member of the runt homology family of proteins [12]. the
rat oc gene promoter contains three recognition sites for
runx2 interactions, site a (−605 to −595), site b (−438

421

to −430), and site c (−138 to −130). mutation of all three
runx2 sites results in significantly reduced oc expression in
bone-derived cells [13].
we have recently shown that within the oc gene promoter context there is a tight functional relationship between
runx2 and the 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -dependent pathways [14]. runx2 and vdr are components of the same
nuclear complexes and colocalized at punctuate foci within
the nucleus of osteoblastic cells [14]. additionally, mutation
of the distal runx2 sites a and b (which flank the vdre, see
fig. 2b) abolishes 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -enhanced
oc promoter activity [14]. in contrast to most nuclear receptors, vdr does not contain an af-1 transactivation domain
at the n-terminal end. therefore, vdr is unable to interact with coactivators through this end [2]. we have recently
shown that the protein–protein interaction between runx2
and vdr requires a domain located at the n-terminal end of
vdr [14], indicating that runx2 plays a key role in the 1␣,25dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -dependent stimulation of the oc gene
promoter in osteoblastic cells by directly stabilizing the binding of vdr to the vdre. runx2 also allows recruitment of
the coactivator p300 to the oc promoter, which results in
upregulation of both basal and 1␣,25-dihydroxy vitamin d3enhanced oc gene transcription [15]. based on these results,
we have postulated that runx2-mediated recruitment of p300
may be facilitating the subsequent interaction of p300 with
vdr upon ligand stimulation ([14] and see fig. 2b).

3.  xxxg1510xxx  and drip are recruited to the osteocalcin
promoter in a sequential manner
recent studies have shown that different co-activators are
recruited by nuclear receptors to hormone-regulated promoters in a sequential and cyclic manner [16–20]. in particular,
it has been reported that in osteoblastic cells there is rapid
and cyclic association of vdr with the 24-hydroxylase
and osteopontin genes in response to 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  [20]. this interaction is accompanied by an also

plasmids and the rat oc gene promoter-luciferase reporter construct carrying a wild type (poc-luc) or mutated (pmshe-oc-luc) vdre. cells were incubated
in the absence (white bars) or presence (black bars) of 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  for 24 h, harvested, and the luciferase activity measured. the combination
of plasmids used in each experiment is explained below the graphs. the luciferase activity data were normalized to values for pcmv-␤-galactosidase activity
as an internal control. each bar represents the mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 6; p < 0.05).

rapid, cyclic, sequential and mutually exclusive recruitment
of the coactivator complexes  xxxg1510xxx /p300/cbp and drip.
binding of  xxxg1510xxx /p300/cbp is found correlated with an
increase of  xxxg1052xxx  acetylation at the 24-hydroxylase
promoter but not at the osteopontin promoter, suggesting
that in osteoblastic cells different promoters are modulated
by distinct mechanisms in response to 1␣,25-dihydroxy
 xxxd1682xxx .
we have determined that both  xxxg1396xxx  and  xxxg1510xxx  coactivators can also contribute to the 1␣,25-dihydroxy vitamin
d3-mediated enhancement of the oc gene promoter activity
(fig. 1). we transiently transfected ros 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells with a construct containing the full length (1.1 kb)
oc promoter controlling the expression of the reporter gene
luciferase. this construct contains all the basal tissue-specific
and 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -dependent regulatory elements [15]. the effect of  xxxg1396xxx  (fig. 1a and b) or
 xxxg1510xxx  (fig. 1c and d) was assessed by cotransfecting cmvdriven  xxxg1396xxx  or  xxxg1510xxx  expression plasmids, respectively.
overexpression of both  xxxg1396xxx  and  xxxg1510xxx  results in
upregulation of the 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -dependent
enhancement of the oc promoter activity without affecting
basal activity. this stimulatory effect requires an intact and
functional vdre, as a mutated version of the oc promoterluciferase construct (pmshe-oc-luc) that is not recognized
by vdr [15] can not be up-regulated by either  xxxg1396xxx 
(fig. 1b) or  xxxg1510xxx  (fig. 1d) in cells incubated with 1␣,25dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx .
to assess whether  xxxg1396xxx  and  xxxg1510xxx  are recruited
to the oc gene promoter in ros 17/2.8 cells exposed to
1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx , chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) analyses were carried out [14]. ros 17/2.8
cells were incubated with 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  for
different periods (0–12 h) and the extend to which these coactivators are associated with the distal oc promoter region was
quantified by combining chip and real time pcr. we find that
vdr binds to the oc promoter shortly (1 h, not shown) after
the cells are exposed to 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx , reaching a peak in binding after 4 h of incubation with the ligand
(fig. 2a). interaction of vdr is accompanied by recruitment
of  xxxg1510xxx  but not of  xxxg1396xxx , indicating that  xxxg1510xxx  is the

primary coactivator that is associated with the oc promoter
upon 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  stimulation (fig. 2a
and data not shown). rt-pcr and nuclear run off analyses ([10] and not shown) demonstrate that 1␣,25-dihydroxy
 xxxd1682xxx -mediated transcriptional up-regulation is highest after 4 h of treatment with 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx .
in addition, we find that a 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -

l. carvallo et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 103 (2007) 420–424

mediated increase in histone acetylation at the oc gene
promoter occurs within the first 2 h of incubation with this
hormone ([21] and data not shown), therefore accompanying 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx -dependent transcriptional
enhancement and binding of the vdr- xxxg1510xxx  complex to the
distal oc promoter.
interestingly,  xxxg1396xxx  is only found at the oc promoter of ros17/2.8 cells after several hours of exposure
to 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  (e.g. 8 h), when  xxxg1510xxx  is
not longer bound (fig. 2a). interaction of  xxxg1396xxx  with the
oc gene promoter is tightly associated with increased binding of drip130, a key component of the mediator complex
(fig. 2a). this may be an indication that a direct interaction between the vdr-associated complex bound to the
distal oc promoter and the rna pol ii holoenzyme complex
takes place after  xxxg1396xxx  is recruited to the promoter (see
fig. 2b).

4. conclusions
in conclusion, our results indicate that in osteoblastic
ros 17/2.8 cells exposed to 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx ,
vdr preferentially recruits the coactivator  xxxg1510xxx  to upregulate oc gene transcription (see fig. 2b).  xxxg1396xxx  is
found interacting at the oc promoter after several hours of
1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  treatment, concomitant with
the release of  xxxg1510xxx . this is in contrast to previous reports
indicating that  xxxg1510xxx  and  xxxg1396xxx  are recruited to steroid
hormone-regulated promoters in a sequential, mutually
exclusive and cyclic manner [16–20]. hence, a general mechanism including rapid and cyclic coactivator recruitment may
not apply to all nuclear receptor-regulated genes and therefore
extensive analyses at the different 1␣,25-dihydroxy vitamin
d3-responsive promoters should be carried out.
taking together these and previous results, we propose that
the preferential recruitment of  xxxg1510xxx  at the oc gene relies on
the specific organization of regulatory elements at the distal
region of the promoter (fig. 2b). this organization has been
shown to facilitate protein–protein interactions that stabilize
binding of runx2-p300 and vdr-runx2 to this promoter
region [14,15]. as  xxxg1510xxx  can also form stable complexes
with p300, this may provide the basis for the formation of a
stable complex at the distal oc promoter region that includes
runx2, p300, vdr, and  xxxg1510xxx  (see fig. 2b).
