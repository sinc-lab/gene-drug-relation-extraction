a wide variety of stressors can increase brain tryptophan
content and subsequently affect serotonin (5-ht) metabolism
(curzon et al., 1972; chaouloff et al., 1985; dunn, 1988a).
stress-related elevations in brain tryptophan are normal in
adrenalectomized animals (curzon et al., 1972; dunn and
welch, 1991), but can be blocked by ganglionic blockers and
␤-adrenergic antagonists (dunn and welch, 1991), suggesting that the changes are a consequence of peripheral sympathetic activation of ␤-adrenergic receptors. indeed, periphthis work was supported in part by national institutes of health grants

resulted in larger increases (80 to 100%). pretreatment with the
␤2-selective antagonist ici 118551 (0.5 mg/kg (⫾)-1-[2,3(dihydro-7-methyl-1h-inden-4-yl)oxyl]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol) attenuated the increases in tryptophan induced by both clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg) and dobutamine (10
mg/kg). pretreatment with the ␤1/2-selective antagonist propranolol (2.5 mg/kg), the ␤3-selective antagonist sr 59230a

ici 118551 (0.5 mg/kg) did not prevent the brl 37344induced increase in brain tryptophan, whereas the ␤1/2/3antagonist  xxxd384xxx  (10 mg/kg) attenuated it. cl 316243
had no effect on brain tryptophan in ␤3-receptor knockout
mice, whereas clenbuterol increased brain tryptophan, indicating that ␤-adrenergic modulation of brain tryptophan occurs
in the absence of ␤3-receptors. we conclude that activation of
either ␤2- or ␤3-adrenergic receptors, but not ␤1-adrenergic
receptors, increases mouse brain tryptophan content.

eral administration of the nonselective ␤-adrenergic agonist
 xxxd2401xxx  (eriksson and carlsson, 1988) or the ␤2-selective agonist clenbuterol (edwards et al., 1989) results in
comparable increases in brain tryptophan in rats. likewise,
imipramine, which inhibits norepinephrine reuptake, elevates brain tryptophan through a ␤-adrenergic-dependent
mechanism, as evidenced by prevention of its effects by propranolol (edwards and sorisio, 1988).
there are three known subtypes of ␤-adrenergic receptors,
␤1, ␤2, and ␤3, all of which are thought to couple primarily via
gs␣ to adenylyl cylase, leading to an increase in cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp), although recent evidence suggests that ␤2- and ␤3-receptors can also couple to gi␣ (soeder
et al., 1999; xiao et al., 1999). the receptor subtypes differ
primarily in their location: ␤1-adrenoceptors predominate in
the heart, cerebral cortex, and kidney (minneman et al.,
1979; mcpherson et al., 1984; engel et al., 1985). the major

abstract
brain tryptophan concentrations are increased by various
stressful treatments, an effect that can be prevented by ␤-adrenoceptor antagonists. this study aimed to determine the
␤-adrenergic subtype responsible for the tryptophan response.
male cd-1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of nonselective and subtype-selective ␤-adrenergic antagonists 20 min
before subtype-selective ␤-agonists. selected brain regions
were dissected for analysis of tryptophan content by highperformance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. the ␤2-selective agonist clenbuterol (0.3 mg/kg) induced increases in brain tryptophan that reached a peak
(⬃60%) 1 h following injection and small but statistically significant increases (⬃20%) in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid: serotonin ratios 2 h following injection. the ␤1-selective agonist dobutamine (10 mg/kg) produced less robust increases (⬃40%) in
brain tryptophan, whereas the ␤3-selective agonists brl 37344

etal muscle, and blood vessels is the ␤2-adrenoceptor (minneman et al., 1979; carswell and nahorski, 1983; mcpherson
et al., 1984; o’donnell and wanstall, 1985; jensen et al.,
1995). the ␤3-adrenoceptor is expressed at high levels in
brown and white adipose tissue, but has also been detected in
brain, stomach, and gall bladder (guillaume et al., 1994;
summers et al., 1995; evans et al., 1996).
although edwards et al. (1989) suggested that the effect of
␤-agonists on brain tryptophan is selective for ␤2-adrenoceptors, it remains unknown whether ␤3-adrenoceptors affect
brain tryptophan. the current study was designed to determine the receptor subtype-selectivity for the increase in
brain tryptophan produced by ␤-adrenergic agonists in mice.
because the rate of 5-ht synthesis is directly influenced by
the availability of tryptophan to tryptophan hydroxylase
(fernstrom, 1983), the present results may have important
implications for 5-ht synthesis, and potentially for depression and other disorders associated with brain 5-ht.

animals. male cd-1 virus-antigen free (vaf plus) mice weighing
between 18 and 20 g were obtained from charles river (raleighdurham facility, colony r16). mice were group-housed at 22–23°c in
an association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care (aaalac)-accredited animal care facility under a 12–12
light/dark cycle with lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00 am. both food and water were
available ad libitum. at least 48 h before each experiment, mice were
placed in individual cages to avoid problems associated with disturbing group-housed animals. for studies with ␤3-adrenergic receptor
(ar) null mice, 8- to 10-week-old male fvb/nj (wt) and agematched fvb/nj male mice with a targeted disruption of the ␤3-ar
gene (␤3-ar ko) (susulic et al., 1995) were used. all procedures were
approved by the louisiana state university health sciences centershreveport animal care and use committee.
experimental procedures. mice were injected intraperitoneally
(i.p.) with various ␤-agonists dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline at a
volume of 10 ␮l/g of body weight. in experiments to determine
receptor subtype-selectivity, antagonists were administered 20 min
before agonists. mice were sacrificed by decapitation 1 h following
the last injection unless noted otherwise. the brain was rapidly
removed and frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and brain stem were
dissected as previously described (dunn, 1988b). brain regions were
quickly weighed in tared eppendorf tubes and frozen on dry ice.
tryptophan, serotonin (5-ht), and its major catabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) were analyzed by hplc with electrochemical detection as described previously (dunn, 1993). for some
studies, a shortened hplc run was used to measure tryptophan only
(retention time 7.5 min). for this, we used a spherisorb octadecyl
silane (ods 1) reverse-phase column (25 cm, 5 ␮m; keystone scientific, inc., bellefonte, pa) shortened to 12.5 cm. the mobile phase
contained 0.05 m nah2po4 (ph 2.75), 0.1 mm edta, 0.5 mm octanesulfonic acid (sodium salt), and 5% acetonitrile.

results
time course studies. mice were injected with the ␤2selective agonist clenbuterol (0.3 mg/kg) or saline and brain
samples collected 15, 30, 60, or 120 min following the injection. the tryptophan concentration in hypothalamus increased within 30 min, reached a maximum within 1 h, and
returned to pretreatment levels within 2 h (fig. 1a). interestingly, 5-hiaa:5-ht, an index of 5-ht metabolism, was
significantly elevated 1 h after the maximum tryptophan
increase, perhaps reflecting increased tryptophan availability (fig. 1b). similar results were obtained in brain stem
(data not shown).

because the knockouts were based on an fvb background,
fvb mice were used as age-matched controls. mice were
treated with cl 316243 1 h before brain samples were collected. cl 316243 significantly increased brain tryptophan in
the wild-type mice, but had no effect in the ␤3-receptor
knockout mice. two-way anova indicated an interaction
between agonist and genotype in brain stem, hypothalamus,
and frontal cortex (p ⬍ 0.001). to determine whether ␤3receptor knockout mice would respond to clenbuterol, the
mice were treated with clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg) 1 h before
brain and blood samples were collected (fig. 7b). the knockout mice exhibited a normal clenbuterol-induced increase in
tryptophan, indicating that the knockout mice could show a
normal tryptophan response, and suggesting that clenbuterol
did not exert its actions via ␤3-adrenoceptors. two-way
anova detected no interaction between genotype and agonist.

discussion
the present study extends earlier findings that activation
of ␤-adrenergic receptors induced robust increases in brain
tryptophan (eriksson and carlsson, 1988; edwards et al.,
1989; takao et al., 1992). consistent with data from edwards
et al. (1989) using sprague-dawley rats, we observed that
the activation of the ␤2-, but not the ␤1-subtype of adrenergic

receptors increased brain tryptophan in male cd-1 mice.
however, we also observed that activation of ␤3-adrenergic
receptors induced similar but more robust increases in brain
tryptophan.
although the nonselective antagonist propranolol is lipophilic and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, the hydrophilic antagonist  xxxd2689xxx  has only limited access to the
central nervous system (schiff and saxey, 1984). this suggests that the effect of clenbuterol was exerted peripherally.
pretreatment with the ␤2-selective antagonist ici 118551
(0.5 mg/kg), but not the ␤1-selective antagonist betaxolol (1
mg/kg), attenuated the clenbuterol-induced increases in
brain tryptophan in mice sacrificed 60 min after clenbuterol.
ici 118551 and betaxolol were used at doses considered to be
sufficient to block ␤-receptors, but still selective for the intended receptor subtype (crissman et al., 2001). the elevation of brain tryptophan induced by the moderately selective
␤1-agonist dobutamine was probably caused by activation of
␤2-adrenergic receptors, because the ␤2-selective antagonist
ici 118551 attenuated the increase. the ␤1-selective antagonist atenolol, again, at a dose selective for the ␤1-adrenoceptor subtype (ben-eliyahu et al., 2000; zhang et al., 2000),
had no effect on the dobutamine-induced increases in brain
tryptophan, providing stronger evidence that ␤1-adrenergic
receptors were not involved. indeed, although binding stud-

␤-adrenergic receptors increase brain tryptophan

ies indicate that dobutamine is modestly ␤1-selective (williams and bishop, 1981), it is reported to activate ␤1-, ␤2-,
and ␣1-adrenoceptors at doses used clinically (ruffolo, 1987).
these data suggest that ␤2-, but not ␤1, -adrenergic receptors
can increase brain tryptophan.
whereas  xxxd384xxx , a ␤1/2/3-receptor antagonist, attenuated the effects of the ␤3-agonist, brl 37344, propranolol
had no effect at a dose that blocks ␤1/2-receptors (yang and
dunn, 1990). this suggests that ␤3-receptors can mediate
elevations of brain tryptophan independent of ␤1/2-receptors.
the attenuation by  xxxd384xxx  was not complete, but this
may be because  xxxd384xxx  has a short half-life (coruzzi and
bertaccini, 1997). because cl 316243, a ␤3-receptor agonist
10,000 times more selective for ␤3-receptors than ␤2-receptors and having little, if any, activity at ␤1-receptors (bloom
et al., 1992), increased brain tryptophan provides further
support for the role of ␤3-adrenergic receptors. moreover, the
lack of effect of cl 316243 in ␤3-ar ko mice clearly indicates
that ␤3-adrenergic receptors can mediate increases in brain
tryptophan independent of other ␤-adrenergic subtypes.
thus, the surprising inability of the ␤3-selective antagonist,
sr 59230a, to attenuate the effects of either brl 37344 or
cl 316243, may not be ascribable to agonist effects on ␤1/2adrenergic receptors. one explanation is a strain difference
(fvb versus cd-1) in the response to sr 59230a, although
this cannot be confirmed because the administration of sr

(n ⫽ 6) were injected with cl 316243 (0.1 mg/kg) (a); or clenbuterol (0.1
mg/kg) (b) and brain samples collected 1 h later. tryptophan concentrations were determined in brain stem, hypothalamus, and frontal cortex.
two-way anova indicated significant agonist-genotype interactions for
cl 316243 in brain stem (f1,23 ⫽ 40.6, p ⬍ 0.001), hypothalamus (f1,23 ⫽
44.6, p ⬍ 0.001), and frontal cortex (f1,23 ⫽ 27.0, p ⬍ 0.001), but nonsignificant interactions for clenbuterol in brain stem (f1,14 ⫽ 0.104, p ⫽

59230a to fvb mice has not been reported in the literature.
it is also possible that the doses of sr 59230a tested were not
sufficient to block ␤3-receptors, the route of administration
(i.p. injection) may not have been optimal for this antagonist,
or the drug is not as effective in male cd-1 mice as it is in
rats (manara et al., 1996). indeed, in previous studies conducted to demonstrate the ␤3-receptor selectivity of sr
59230a, it was given by gavage to rats (manara et al., 1996).
very few studies have used sr 59230a in vivo, perhaps
because binding to plastics and proteins such as bovine  xxxg124xxx  must be considered when using sr 59230a
(nisoli and carruba, 1997). however, propranolol administered i.p. with sr 59230a at doses similar to those used in
these studies reportedly blocked all three ␤-adrenoceptor
subtypes in c57bl/6 mice (evans et al., 1999). taken together, the above results suggest that stimulation of ␤3receptors, like ␤2-receptors, can increase brain tryptophan.
activation of ␤3-adrenergic receptors increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white
adipose tissue, making ␤3-receptors potential anti-obesity
targets (arch et al., 1984; bloom et al., 1992; sakura et al.,
2002). the present study indicates another effect of ␤-adrenergic stimulation: increased brain tryptophan leading to elevations in 5-ht metabolism. because 5-ht appears to be

involved in appetite regulation, increased brain tryptophan
could be seen as a useful side effect of the ␤3-receptor agonists which have been proposed for the treatment of obesity
(arch, 2002). indeed, acute administration of cl 316243 in
mice decreases food intake by 45% (susulic et al., 1995) by an
as yet unknown mechanism, but which may involve central
serotonergic systems.
at least three explanations for the mechanism of the increase in brain tryptophan have been proposed. first, ␤-adrenergic receptor activation may induce lipolysis, releasing
free  xxxd2154xxx  that displace bound tryptophan from albumin
in the bloodstream, leading to enhanced transport of free
tryptophan into the brain (wurtman and fernstrom, 1976;
curzon, 1979). whether plasma-total or -free tryptophan is
most critical for brain tryptophan uptake remains controversial, but there is evidence that plasma-free tryptophan is
more important (curzon, 1979). indeed, preliminary studies
in our laboratory indicate that ␤3-agonists increase free fatty
acids and plasma-free tryptophan, whereas ␤2-selective and
nonselective agonists do not (n. lenard and a. dunn, unpublished observations), which may explain the seemingly more
robust increases in brain tryptophan induced by ␤3-agonists.
second, the administration of ␤-adrenergic agonists may
stimulate insulin release (atef et al., 1996; yajima et al.,
1999), which would enhance muscle uptake of branchedchain amino acids and reduce competition of tryptophan for
the common brain neutral amino acid transporter (fernstrom and wurtman, 1972; fernstrom, 1976). it has been
shown that clenbuterol administration results in robust increases in both plasma glucose and insulin (edwards and
virji, 1990). studies are currently being conducted in our
laboratory to further address these questions. third, it has
been speculated that brain endothelial cell ␤-adrenergic receptors in some way regulate the transport of amino acids
into the brain (edwards et al., 1989; takao et al., 1992).
preliminary evidence obtained in our laboratory by measuring the uptake of radiolabeled tryptophan into immortalized
human brain endothelial cells (muruganandam et al., 1997)
and the transport of radiolabeled tryptophan into the brain
using an in vivo perfusion model (banks et al., 2000) did not
support this hypothesis, but further experimentation will be
necessary to exclude this possibility.
in summary, evidence is presented that activation of either
␤2- or ␤3-adrenergic receptors can increase mouse brain tryptophan by as yet unknown mechanisms. moreover, an increase in 5-ht metabolism, suggesting an alteration of central serotonergic systems, may be secondary to this increase
in brain tryptophan. because 5-ht is involved in mood and
appetite regulation, among numerous other functions
(rueter et al., 1997; jacobs and fornal, 1999), these results
indicate the need for further study of the ␤-adrenergic influence on the brain concentration of its precursor, tryptophan.
thus, the present study may have important implications for
the benefits and/or side effects of ␤2- and ␤3-adrenergic agonists.
