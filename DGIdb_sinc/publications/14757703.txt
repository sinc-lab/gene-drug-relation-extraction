1 cgp 12177a mediates cardiostimulation by activation of the ‘putative’ b4-adrenoceptor; however,
it has recently been reported that disruption of the b1-adrenoceptor gene abolishes this effect. we have
adenovirally overexpressed b1-adrenoceptors in isolated, cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes
and observed the inotropic potency of  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a (in the presence of 1 mm
propranolol).
2  xxxd2398xxx  was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pd2 7.6970.12). cgp
12177a was a nonconventional partial agonist (pd2 6.3470.09), increasing inotropy and lusitropy,
with an intrinsic activity of 0.34 and antagonised by  xxxd384xxx .
3 b1-adrenoceptor overexpression enhanced the inotropic potency of  xxxd2398xxx  by 11.7-fold (pd2
8.7670.14) and cgp 12177a by 5.9-fold (7.1170.10), respectively. green fluorescent protein (gfp)
overexpression did not alter the potency of  xxxd2398xxx  or cgp 12177a (pd2 7.4170.24 and pd2
6.6070.50, respectively).
4 the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a were enhanced by  xxxd2388xxx  (phosphodiesterase
inhibitor) and decreased by rp-camps (camp antagonist). cgp 12177a also increased camp
levels. cgp 12177a but not  xxxd2398xxx  initiated arrhythmias at lower concentrations following b1adrenoceptor overexpression.
5 125i-cyanopindolol saturation binding in adv.b1 myocytes demonstrated b18-fold increase in b1adrenoceptors. 3h-cgp 12177a saturation binding, in the presence of propranolol, increased b5-fold
following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors.
6 this study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by cgp 12177a (in the presence of
propranolol) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing b1-adrenoceptors, mediated by a gs/camp
signalling pathway. ‘putative’ b4-adrenoceptor pharmacology appears to be mediated by activation of
a novel affinity state of the b1-adrenoceptor.

introduction
nonconventional partial agonists are b-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g.  xxxd2957xxx  and cgp 12177a) that block the effects of
catecholamines in human heart with high affinity at b1- and b2adrenoceptors, and produce cardiostimulant effects (positive
inotropy, lusitropy and chronotropy) at b100-fold higher

concentrations (kaumann, 1989; kaumann & molenaar,
1997). the cardiostimulant effects of the nonconventional
partial agonists are relatively resistant to antagonism by
classical b1-adrenoceptor antagonists, including propranolol,
but blocked with moderate affinity by  xxxd384xxx  and
carvedilol (kaumann 1989; 1996; lowe et al., 2002). a
pharmacologically distinct gs-protein (stimulatory guanine
nucleotide binding protein)/adenylyl cyclase/adenosine 30 ,50 cyclic monophosphate (camp)-coupled receptor, the ‘putative’
b4-adrenoceptor, was proposed to mediate these effects

c.j. lewis et al

(kaumann, 1997; kaumann & lynham, 1997). catecholamines compete stereoselectively at the receptor in radioligand
binding studies with low affinity but a profile supporting an
adrenoceptor role (sarsero et al., 1998b). [3h]-cgp 12177a
(()-[3h]-cgp 12177 (4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)
[5,7-3h]benzimidazole-2-one)) has been validated as a radioligand for b-adrenoceptor populations and has been
shown to label a site thought to mediate the cardiostimulant
effects of cgp 12177a ((7)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one) in human (sarsero et al.,
1998a; 2003) and rat (sarsero et al., 1998b; 1999) atria and
ventricles.
although b4-adrenoceptor pharmacology partly resembles
that of the b3-adrenoceptor, it is distinct. the b4-adrenoceptor
is not activated by selective b3-adrenoceptor agonists (kaumann & molenaar, 1996; malinowska & schlicker, 1996;
oostendorp & kaumann, 2000; sarsero et al., 1999), sr 59230
(3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1s)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2s)- xxxd2400xxx  oxalate) (selective b3-adrenoceptor antagonist) fails to shift the concentration–response curve to
cgp 121777a (kaumann & molenaar, 1996) and the
cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a are still observed in
hearts of knockout mice with disruption of the b3-adrenoceptor gene (kaumann et al., 1998).
recent evidence suggests that the cardiostimulant or b4-like
effects of cgp 12177a may be mediated by a novel state or
site of the b1-adrenoceptor with a lower affinity for b-blockers
than the high-affinity catecholamine site (konkar et al., 2000a;
kaumann et al., 2001; granneman, 2001). cgp 12177a has
been observed to upregulate the camp response in cell lines
overexpressing the b1-adrenoceptor at high density (pak &
fishman, 1996; konkar et al., 2000a). in addition, the
cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a are seen in atria from
wild-type and knockout mice with disruption of the b2adrenoceptor gene, but not in double b1-/b2-adrenoceptor
knockout mice despite preservation of camp signalling
(kaumann et al., 2001). however, controversy remains over
the mechanism of action of cgp 12177a since it has also been
shown to upregulate the camp response in cell lines overexpressing the b2-adrenoceptor (pak & fishman, 1996; baker
& hill, 2002).
the continued interest in the b4-like effect of cgp 12177a is
partly due to its potential role in arrhythmogenesis in man.
cgp 12177a produces changes in the cardiac action potential
and ventricular extra-systoles in ferret ventricle (lowe et al.,
1998). cgp 12177a also induces arrhythmias in rat ventricular
myocytes (kaumann & freestone, 1997).
the aim of this study was to examine the cardiostimulant
effects of  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a (in the presence of
propranolol) on isolated and cultured adult rat ventricular
cardiomyocytes following adenoviral overexpression of human
recombinant b1-adrenoceptors or a reporter gene construct,
jelly fish green fluorescent protein (gfp). b1-overexpression
increased the arrhythmogenicity of cgp 12177a. a similar
magnitude increase in the sensitivity to both  xxxd2398xxx  and
cgp 12177a was observed following overexpression of b1adrenoceptors but not gfp. an increase in the binding of
[3h]-cgp 12177a (in the presence of propranolol) was also
observed. taken together, this suggests that the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a and b4-adrenoceptor pharmacology are mediated by a propranolol-resistant state of the
b1-adrenoceptor.

overexpressed b1-ar enhance cgp 12177 cardiostimulation

methods
cardiomyocyte isolation, culture and adenoviral infection
all studies complied with the united kingdom home office
regulations governing the care and use of laboratory
animals. single ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as previously described (vescovo et al.,
1989) and were then cultured and infected with adenoviral
vector. adult male sprague–dawley rats were heparinised and
killed by cervical dislocation, and the heart was rapidly excised
and placed in ice-cold krebs–henseleit (kh) solution of the
following composition (in mm): nacl 119, kcl 4.7,  xxxd2534xxx 
0.94, kh2po2 1.2, nahco3 25, glucose 11.5 and cacl2 1;
equilibrated to ph 7.4 with 95% o2–5% co2.
a langendorff perfusion method similar to that described
previously was used (vescovo et al., 1989). the heart was
mounted on a needle canal attached to a langendorff
perfusion apparatus and equilibrated in a retrograde manner
for 5 min with kh solution containing 1 mm ca2 þ at 371c.
the perfusate was then changed to a low-ca2 þ solution of the
following composition (in mm): nacl 120, kcl 5.4,  xxxd2534xxx  5,
pyruvate 5, glucose 20, taurine 20, n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n’-2-ethanesulphonic acid (hepes) 10 and  xxxd2739xxx  (nta) 5 and ca2 þ was added to give a final
concentration of 12–14 mm as measured with a ca2 þ electrode,
also at 371c and bubbled with 100% o2 at ph 6.95. after
5 min, this was changed to a solution similar to the low-ca2 þ
solution but with no nta and 200 mmol l1 ca2 þ with
1 mg ml1 collagenase and 0.6 mg ml1 hyaluronidase added,
for 10 min. the ventricles were then chopped with scissors and
the pieces incubated in the same solution twice for 10 min. the
medium was shaken gently throughout this incubation at
351c, and kept under an atmosphere of 100% o2. the
dispersed cells were then strained through  xxxd3426xxx  mm mesh
gauze and the supernatant was centrifuged at 40  g for 1 min
at room temperature. the cells were then washed three times
and cultured as previously described (davia et al., 1999) with
plating at 2  104 cm2 in  xxxd1728xxx  medium with the addition of
0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 100 mm ascorbate, 5 mm
creatine, 5 mm taurine, 2 mm carnitine, 0.1 mm insulin,
10,000 u ml ml1 penicillin and 10 mg ml1 streptomycin. overexpression of the gene of interest was achieved by addition of
the adenovirus containing the sequence for human b1
adrenoceptor (adv.b1) or jelly fish green fluorescent protein
(adv.gfp) to the medium before plating, at a density of
2  106 active particles cm2, to give a multiplicity of infection
(moi) of 100. all experiments were carried out following 48 h
culture.

measurement of cell contraction
myocytes in suspension were placed into a 200 ml perspex bath
with a glass floor on the stage of an inverted microscope (zeiss
im, germany). after 5 min, to allow cells to spontaneously
attach to the floor of the chamber, they were superfused with
kh solution adjusted to ph 7.4 by equilibration with 95% o2–
5% co2 at 2 ml min1. the temperature was maintained at
3670.51c by a heater placed just before the chamber inlet and
by thermocouples for feedback control of the heater. cells
were paced at 0.5 hz with the use of a bipolar pulse (width 0.1–
0.5 ms) via platinum electrodes along the sides of the bath.

c.j. lewis et al

continuous measurement of myocyte contraction amplitude
and rates of shortening and relaxation were carried out as
previously described (harding et al., 1988; gong et al., 2000).
a video-motion detection device was used to display cell length
and rate of change of cell length continuously to a chart
recorder. the scanning rate of the camera was 100 hz and the
spatial resolution was 1–512. time-to-peak contraction (ttp),
time-to-50 and 90% relaxation (r50, r90) were obtained from
an average of 6 beats.
the myocytes were selected according to criteria adapted
from those described previously (harding et al., 1988) to
ensure that populations of cells with similar functional
properties were used for contraction studies. myocytes used
were rod shaped with clear sarcomeres, no blebs or granulations and were quiescent in 1 mm ca2 þ . myocytes were
allowed to stabilise for at least 10 min in 1 mm ca2 þ and had
to demonstrate stable contraction amplitude and diastolic
length at 0.5 hz pacing prior to drug challenge. cells that
satisfied these criteria were subjected to cumulative concentration–response experiments using  xxxd2398xxx  (0.1 nm to 3 mm),
each concentration of agonist was left in contact for 5 min or
until a steady response had been reached. maximum contraction was judged to have occurred either when there was no
increase in contraction amplitude between successive concentrations of  xxxd2398xxx  or the myocyte developed arrhythmias.
all experiments using cgp 12177a were performed in the
presence of the nonselective b-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1mm) unless specifically described in the text. myocytes
were preincubated with propranolol for 20–30 min, and the
concentration–response experiments were repeated on the
same cell using cgp 12177a (10 nm to 3 mm) in the continued
presence of propranolol. to determine whether amplitudes
equivalent to those with maximum  xxxd2398xxx  had been
achieved with cgp 12177a, 100 nm and 0.1 mm  xxxd2398xxx 
was then superfused over the myocytes to observe whether
maximum contraction had been reached. to observe whether
the myocyte would return to baseline contraction amplitude,
either cgp 12177a was washed out (in the continued presence
of propranolol), or 1 mm  xxxd384xxx  was added. spontaneous
arrhythmias were defined as myocytes demonstrating wavelike contractions at a rate greater than 2 min1 in 1 mm ca2 þ
when not electrically stimulated.

method of bradford (bradford, 1976) with igg used as the
standard (bio-rad, hemel hempstead, u.k.).

radioligand receptor binding assay
following 48 h culture with or without adv.b1 infection,
cardiac myocytes were harvested and stored at 701c until
use. prior to use, myocytes were thawed, resuspended in
incubation buffer (25 mm tris-hcl (tris-hydrochloride), ph
7.4) and homogenised on ice with a polytron homogenizer
(3  10 s) and further disrupted by repeated passage through a
sterile 21-gauge needle. the samples were centrifuged at
1000  g for 10 min at 41c to remove unhomogenised debris
and the supernatant centrifuged at 40,000  g for 20 min at
41c. the pellet was then washed twice in cold incubation
buffer (containing 0.32 mm sucrose) and centrifuged at
40,000  g for 20 min at 41c. the pellet was resuspended in
2 ml of incubation buffer and filtered through nylon membranes. the binding assays were performed on membrane
protein using increasing amounts of the b-adrenoceptorspecific ligands [125i]-cyanopindolol (specific activity
2000 ci mmol1, 3.125–100 pm) for b1-adrenoceptors or [3h]cgp 12177a (specific activity 46 ci mmol1, 7.8125–250 nm).
nonspecific binding was defined using 100 mm cgp 12177a.
[3h]-cgp 12177a saturation binding was performed in the
presence of 500 nm propranolol. incubation was carried out in
250 ml of incubation buffer at 371c for 90 min with gentle
agitation. the incubation was terminated by rapid vacuum
filtration through gf/c glass-fibre filters (whatman, clifton,
nj, u.s.a.) with the use of a cell harvester (brandel, model
m-24). filters were rapidly washed three times with 5 ml icecold incubation buffer and counted in an auto gamma counter
for [125i]-cyanopindolol (packard instruments, model 5550,
downers grove, il, u.s.a.) at an efficiency of 80% or a
rackbeta spectral liquid scintillation counter for [3h]-cgp
12177a (lkb/wallac, model 1219). protein concentration
was determined by the method of bradford (bradford, 1976)
with igg used as the standard (bio-rad, hemel hempstead,
u.k.). all assays were performed in duplicate, and receptor
density was normalised to mg membrane protein. kd and the
maximal number of binding sites (bmax) for [125i]-cyanopindolol or [3h]-cgp 12177a were determined by scatchard
analysis of saturation binding curves.

measurement of steady-state camp accumulation

materials

after isolation, single adult ventricular cardiomyocytes were
plated at 2  104 cm2 on 12-well culture plates precoated with
laminin (40 mg ml1) prior to adenoviral infection. experiments
were performed after 48 h culture by washing twice in es to
remove nonviable myocytes. camp was measured in the
adherent cell cultures using a nonacetylation camp enzyme
immunoassay system (amersham pharmacia biotech, little
chalfont, u.k.). cells were incubated in 1 ml low-ca2 þ (kh
with no nta) for 10 min with 1 mm  xxxd2398xxx  or 3 mm cgp
12177a (a concentration chosen to match the maximum effect
observed in contraction experiments), in the presence of 1 mm
propranolol at 371c in a co2 incubator. myocyte lysis was
performed using 200 ml of lysis reagent (supplied) and
confirmed by trypan blue staining. 100 ml of the supernatant
was used in the camp assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. protein concentration was determined by the

pyruvate, taurine, nta, hyaluronidase (type i-s), adenosine30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphorothioate, rp-isomer (rp-camps),
 xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ), (7)-cgp 12177a and
 xxxd2398xxx -hcl were obtained from sigma (poole, u.k.).
collagenase ii (worthington) was from cambridge bioscience
(cambridge, u.k.). all other agents used for kh and lowca2 þ solutions were obtained from  xxxg257xxx  (poole, u.k.).
aristar-grade kcl and glucose were used for low-ca2 þ
solutions. all other reagents were analar grade. analar
water ( xxxg257xxx ) was used for low-ca2 þ solutions. milli q water
was used for other solutions. [125i]-cyanopindolol and [3h]cgp 12177a were purchased from amersham (amersham
pharmacia biotech, little chalfont, u.k.).  xxxd384xxx  was a
generous gift of schwartz-pharma (mannheim, germany).

data analysis
all data are presented as mean7standard error of the mean
(s.e.m.). the mean values for experiments performed on
different days and hence in different rat myocyte preparations
were used in statistical analysis. between group comparison
was made by unpaired student’s t-test and paired t-test was
applied for within-group comparison. agonist ec50 values
were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the
hypmic program or prism 3.0 software. the n in the text
refers to the number of separate myocytes studied. a value of
po0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

results
b-adrenoceptor density and [3h]-cgp 12177a binding
increases following infection with adv.b1
total b-adrenoceptor binding (b1- and b2-adrenoceptors) of
[125i]-cyanopindolol to adult rat cardiomyocyte membranes
yielded a pkd of 10.770.08 and a bmax of
27.773.70 fmol mg protein1. following infection with adv.b1
at an moi of 100, [125i]-cyanopindolol binding yielded a pkd
of 10.670.20 and a bmax of 490734.0 fmol.mg protein1,
representing an approximate 18-fold increase in the total b-ar
myocyte surface receptor population (po0.001; figure 1).
this moi of 100, giving a moderate increase in total b-ar
receptor number, was used for all further experiments.
[3h]-cgp 12177a, in the presence of 1 mm propranolol,
appeared to label a significant receptor population that was
increased b5-fold following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors (po0.05 at 250 nm [3h]-cgp 12177a; figure 2). the pkd
in uninfected and adv.b1 myocytes was 6.7870.19 and
6.6570.35, respectively.

adv.gfp infection does not alter the contractile responses
to  xxxd2398xxx  or cgp 12177a
to establish whether adenoviral transfection of a control gene
not involved in cardiomyocyte contraction affects the contractile responses to  xxxd2398xxx  or cgp 12177a, we used a
control virus, adv.gfp. the successful infection of an
individual myocyte with adv.gfp led to green fluorescence
of the myocyte. it was therefore possible to determine that at
an moi of 100, over 75% of myocytes and at an moi 1000,
over 90% of ventricular myocytes were successfully infected
and expressing gfp (data not shown). in uninfected cells,
 xxxd2398xxx  produced a concentration-dependent increase in
contraction of isolated single adult rat cardiomyocytes,
measured as cell shortening (pd2 7.7470.22). following
infection with adv.gfp at an moi of 1000, there was no
significant difference in response to  xxxd2398xxx  (pd2
7.4170.24; p40.1; figure 3a). in the presence of 1 mm
propranolol, to block b1- and b2-adrenoceptors, cgp
12177a stimulated a smaller but significant increase in
contraction (pd2 6.4470.26). following infection with
adv.gfp, there was no significant difference in contraction
(pd2 6.6070.50; p40.6; figure 3b).

overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors enhances the
contractile responses to both  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp

in uninfected cells,  xxxd2398xxx  produced a concentrationdependent increase in contraction of the single adult rat
cardiomyocytes (pd2 7.6970.12). following overexpression of
b1-adrenoceptors, there was a significant increase in sensitivity
to the cardiostimulation induced by  xxxd2398xxx  with an 11.7fold left shift in the concentration–response curve (pd2
8.7670.14; po0.001; figure 4a). there was no significant
difference in the maximum amplitude (uninfected emax
11.270.46% shortening; adv.b1 10.972.17% shortening;
p40.57).
in uninfected cells, in the presence of 1 mm propranolol,

contraction of rat cardiomyocytes (pd2 6.3470.09;
34.474.90% of the maximal  xxxd2398xxx  response). following

cgp 12177a did not significantly alter the ttp in either

(po0.02 at 3 mm cgp 12177a; figure 10b).
cgp 12177a stimulated a small steady-state camp increase
in uninfected myocytes (basal 2.8270.52 pmol mg protein1,
cgp 4.1870.56, n ¼ 7; po0.05). this represents approximately 47% of the maximal camp following stimulation with
 xxxd2398xxx  (data not shown). following overexpression with
b1-adrenoceptors, there was a much larger steady-state camp
response to cgp 12177a (basal 3.8570.75 pmol mg protein1,
cgp 12177a 6.2970.95; po0.005; figure 11). there was no
difference between basal camp in uninfected and b1-adrenoceptor overexpressing myocytes (p40.3).

spontaneous arrhythmia. there was no change in the
concentration of  xxxd2398xxx  at which arrhythmias first
appeared (uninfected mean  xxxd2398xxx  concentration threshold 0.49 mm, adv.b1 0.13 mm; p40.3; figure 12a). however,
british journal of pharmacology vol 141 (5)

when stimulated with cgp 12177a, there was an excess of
arrhythmias in overexpressing myocytes compared with
uninfected cells (11 of 43 uninfected and 26 of 47 adv.b1
myoytes; po0.05, w2). there was a reduced cgp 12177a
concentration threshold at which arrhythmias first occurred
following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors (uninfected
mean cgp 12177a concentration threshold 1.19 mm, adv.b1
0.40 mm; po0.05; figure 12b). adv.b1 infected myocytes
demonstrating arrhythmia at 3 mm cgp 12177a were additionally superfused with 1 mm  xxxd384xxx , in the continued
presence of cgp 12177a. in six of nine cells, the arrhythmia
was reversed in addition to a decrease in contraction
amplitude.

discussion
in this study, cgp 12177a was a partial agonist compared
with  xxxd2398xxx  but the cardiostimulation was propranolol
resistant and antagonised by  xxxd384xxx . overexpression of
b1-adrenoceptors by adenoviral transfection in single adult rat
cardiomyocytes increased the inotropic potency and radioligand binding to both  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a to a
similar extent. the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a
were enhanced by  xxxd2388xxx  and depressed by rp-camps
consistent with the involvement of a camp/pka second
messenger signalling pathway, which was confirmed biochemically. in addition, the ability of  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a
to initiate arrhythmia appear to differ with increased
arrhythmogenic potency of cgp 12177a following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors.

propranolol has been reported to have a pkb of b6.2 as an
antagonist of the inotropic responses of cgp 12177a in ferret
ventricle (lowe et al., 2002). a small rightward shift in the
concentration–response curve to cgp 12177a was observed in
uninfected cells, but the cardiostimulant effect of cgp 12177a
in adv.b1 myocytes was propranolol resistant. consistent with
mediation of the effects of cgp 12177a by a b4-like receptor,
1 mm  xxxd384xxx  antagonised cardiostimulation.
we have also shown that adenoviral transfection of the
control gene gfp into adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes
did not alter contractile responses to either  xxxd2398xxx  or
cgp 12177a. the lack of change in agonist response to
adv.gfp infection at moi 1000 suggests that at an moi of
only 100 adv.b1 (used in these experiments), any change in the
cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a must be due to the
increase in b1-adrenoceptors alone.

cardiostimulation by  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a
mediated by different states of the b1-adrenoceptor
compared with  xxxd2398xxx . this confirms previous reports
which have shown that cgp 12177a is a nonconventional
partial agonist producing cardiostimulation in rat ventricle
(kaumann, 1989) attributed to activation of a novel b4adrenoceptor (kaumann, 1997).

in uninfected rat ventricular myocytes, the total b-adrenoceptor population (b1- and b2-adrenoceptors) labelled by [125i]cyanopindolol agrees with previously published data (sarsero

we have used overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors in a
functional assay and demonstrated a similar magnitude
increase in potency to both  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a,
suggesting that the enhanced cardiostimulant effects of cgp
12177a are due to the increase in b1-adrenoceptors. since the
cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a are propranolol
resistant at a concentration expected to block completely the
action of catecholamines at b1- and b2-adrenoceptors, cgp
12177a must activate a noncatecholamine site or state of the
b1-adrenoceptor. the increase in the maximum contraction
stimulated by cgp 12177a following b1-adrenoceptor overexpression can be explained by its partial agonist activity.
these findings are in agreement with previous overexpression studies, where cgp 12177a antagonised catecholamines
at low concentrations but could increase adenylyl cyclase
activity at higher concentrations in cell lines overexpressing
b1-adrenoceptors at high (pak & fishman, 1996) and
physiological density (konkar et al., 2000a, b). more recent
studies suggested that a propranolol-resistant state of the b1adrenoceptor mediates the stimulant effects of cgp 12177a in

b4-adrenoceptor. this is supporting evidence for mediation
of the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a by a low-affinity
state of the b1-adrenoceptor and not a separate receptor. the
bmax obtained with [3h]-cgp 12177a binding to uninfected
rat ventricular myocyte membranes is similar to previously
reported values (sarsero et al., 1999). following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors, there is some discrepancy between
the increase in b1-adrenoceptors (b18-fold) and that of the
low-affinity site (b5-fold). however, the low-affinity site in
uninfected myocytes is difficult to quantitate due to the low
specific activity of [3h]-cgp 12177a and the small amounts of
protein available. kaumann et al. (2001) identified a site
labelled by [3h]-cgp 12177a in both wild-type and b1-/b2adrenoceptor double knockout mice, but this site did not
appear to mediate the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a.
however, sarsero et al. (2003) have demonstrated that in
atrium from failing heart, there is a similar reduction in the
densities of the low- and high-affinity [3h]-cgp 12177a
binding sites, together with decreased potency of cgp 12177a.
this suggests that the site labelled by [3h]-cgp 12177a, in the
presence of propranolol, is the site through which cgp
12177a elicits cardiostimulant effects.
sarsero et al. (1998b) considered whether the low-affinity
binding could be interpreted as b1-adrenoceptor binding
shifted rightwards by propranolol by estimating the affinities
of nonconventional partial agonists and catecholamines at b1adrenoceptors. the affinities for all ligands tested were higher
at the b1-adrenoceptor than at the lower-affinity site; however,
the differences between pki values at the two sites were not
consistent (1.6–3.6 log units). if propranolol had simply right
shifted the saturation binding, the difference in pki values
would be identical, regardless of the ligand affinity.
taken together with the increase in the low-affinity site
labelled by [3h]-cgp 12177a in the presence of propranolol
masking the catecholamine site, the increased potency of cgp
12177a following b1-adrenoceptor overexpression further
suggests that the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a are
mediated by a low-affinity state of the b1-adrenoceptor and not
a separate receptor.

b2-adrenoceptor double knockout mice (kaumann et al.,

the increase in [3h]-cgp 12177a binding (in the presence
of propranolol masking the b1- and b2-adrenoceptor catecholamine sites) following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors
suggests a corresponding increase in the low-affinity cgp
12177a binding site, previously attributed to a separate

the molecular or structural state of the b1-adrenoceptor
mediating the cardiostimulant effects of cgp 12177a has not
been elucidated. receptor theory suggests that agonists
produce effects by stabilising an active receptor state with
antagonists stabilising an inactive state. however, recent
evidence suggests that receptors, including the a1a-adrenoceptor and b2-adrenoceptor, can exist in more than one active
state or conformation (samama et al., 1994; ford et al., 1997;
seifert et al., 1999). the literature also supports the existence
of two active states or sites of the b1-adrenoceptor: a highaffinity ‘classical’ catecholamine site stabilised by  xxxd2398xxx 
and a low-affinity site stabilised by cgp 12177a, both in
equilibrium with an inactive state (konkar et al., 2000a, b;
figure 13). it has been suggested that the downstream effects
of the low-affinity state of the b1-adrenoceptor could occur by
interaction with other accessory proteins, possibly in a similar
manner to receptor activity modifying proteins (mclatchie
et al., 1998), post-translational modifications or conformational changes (konkar et al., 2000b).

figure 13 proposed model to explain the interaction of catecholamines and cgp 12177a with the b1-adrenoceptor. catecholamines
bind to and stabilise the r form with high affinity (h) resulting in a
shift to the rh*cat form allowing g protein activation and
increased contraction. standard b-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g.
propranolol) and cgp 12177a can also bind to the inactive r form
with high affinity and shift the equilibrium away from r* to
rh*cgp/prop. cgp 12177a also binds to and stabilise the r form but
with low affinity (l), resulting in a shift to the rl*cgp and
subsequent g protein activation. the low-affinity state also
recognises standard b-adrenoceptor antagonists with but low
affinity.

consideration of the structure–activity relationship of cgp
12177a, propranolol and  xxxd384xxx  at the low-affinity b1adrenoceptor site improves our understanding of these
interactions. b-adrenoceptor ligands may occupy either folded
or extended conformations, with only the extended conformation mediating receptor activation (blin et al., 1993). the
relatively constrained ligand binding pockets of the catecholamine sites of b1- and b2-adrenoceptors only allows interaction with the folded conformations of b-adrenoceptor ligands,
where they behave as antagonists. konkar et al. (2000b)
suggested that the low-affinity site of the b1-adrenoceptor has a
less constrained binding pocket like the b3-adrenoceptor,
allowing interaction with the extended conformation of
aryloxypropanolamines such as cgp 12177a, allowing
receptor activation. propranolol is a high-affinity antagonist
at the catecholamine site where it may occupy a folded
conformation, but in an extended conformation at the novel
site has low affinity.  xxxd384xxx  has a chloride substitution in
the ortho position of the phenyl ring which has been shown to
confer higher-affinity antagonism of the cardiovascular effects
of cgp 12177a (malinowska et al., 2003) compared with the
unsubstituted ring of propranolol. thus, the catecholamine
and cgp 12177a sites of the b1-adrenoceptor may allow
binding of folded and extended conformations, with the cgp
12177a site allowing activation by extended conformers and
relatively low affinity for propranolol but higher affinity for
 xxxd384xxx .

cgp signals via camp–pka pathway
signalling through a camp/pka pathway was suggested by
the increased sensitivity and maximum contraction of uninfected ventricular myocytes in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibition by  xxxd2388xxx  and the significant depressed response
to cgp 12177a in the presence of rp-camps (a competitive
antagonist of camp at pka) in both uninfected and adv.b1
myocytes. increased cgp 12177a stimulated lusitropy (shortening of r90) is also consistent with signalling via a camp
pathway. this was confirmed biochemically, with cgp
12177a increasing steady-state camp. this increase was

greater following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors. however, basal unstimulated camp was not significantly different
between the uninfected and adv.b1 myocytes, suggesting that
raised basal camp does not explain the increased potency to
 xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a. this confirms previous
findings that cardiostimulation by cgp 12177a activates the
camp/pka second messenger pathway (kaumann & lynham, 1997; sarsero et al., 2003).

cgp 12177a elicits arrhythmias through the low-affinity
state of the b1-adrenoceptor
a potentially important finding was the selective effect of b1adrenoceptor overexpression to enhance the arrhythmic
actions of cgp 12177a. in adv.b1 myocytes, cgp 12177a
initiated arrhythmias twice as often, while the  xxxd2398xxx 
arrhythmia frequency remained unchanged, compared with
uninfected myocytes. in addition, although cgp 12177a had
an intrinsic activity of 0.49 compared with  xxxd2398xxx , it
induced arrhythmias in the same proportion of myocytes.
there was also a lower concentration threshold at which cgp
12177a initiated arrhythmias in adv.b1 myocytes. these data
support an increased tendency for arrhythmogenesis through a
noncatecholamine site since the arrhythmias were observed in
the presence of propranolol. a greater potency of cgp
12177a to induce arrhythmias compared with  xxxd2398xxx  has
been previously documented (freestone et al., 1999). in mouse
ventricular myocytes, cgp 12177a was 40 times more potent
than  xxxd2398xxx  in producing arrhythmic ca2 þ transients,
but with a potency suggesting interaction at a high-affinity site
of the b1-adrenoceptor. to explain this, kaumann et al. (2001)
have suggested that the arrhythmic effects of cgp 12177a are
mediated by a high-affinity site of the b1-adrenoceptor that
differs from the low-affinity site mediating the cardiostimulant
effects. it is also possible that the low-affinity site has a
different coupling profile to intracellular signalling pathways.
the selective effect of b1-adrenoceptor overexpression to
enhance the arrhythmic actions of cgp 12177a indicates the
potential importance of activation of this site in arrhythmogenesis. it is interesting to note  xxxd384xxx  stopped the cgp
12177a induced arrhythmia in 67% of myocytes, suggesting a
possible therapeutic role in the treatment of arrhythmia.

study limitations
the single cardiomyocyte contraction model provides a useful,
natural system to study the effect of drugs on g proteincoupled receptors. however, receptor overexpression may
result in b1-adrenoceptors being expressed in cellular locations
where they are not normally expressed and alter cellular
responses. additional limitations of overexpressing human
sequence b1-adrenoceptors in rat myocytes may include altered
relative stoichiometry of receptors to host membrane components or the lack of specific human signal transduction
pathway components in rat, which may limit the effects seen
by overexpression.
the arginine 389 variant of the common b1-adrenoceptor
glycine 389 arginine polymorphism has been shown to couple
to adenylyl cyclase more tightly than the glycine 389 variant
when activated by  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a (mason et al.,
1999; joseph et al., 2002). the relatively small increases in
camp (without phosphodiesterase inhibition) seen following

c.j. lewis et al

b1-adrenoceptor overexpression may be explained by the
glycine 389 variant overexpressed in this study. the influence
of the arginine 389 variant on the response to cgp 12177a in
this system will be important to establish.

conclusions
we have demonstrated that the nonconventional partial
agonist cgp 12177a has cardiostimulant effects in single
adult rat ventricular myocytes, mediated by a camp/pka
signalling mechanism, which are antagonised by  xxxd384xxx .
following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors, there is increased potency of  xxxd2398xxx  and cgp 12177a (which is
propranolol resistant). low-affinity [3h]-cgp 12177a binding
also increases following overexpression of b1-adrenoceptors.

overexpressed b1-ar enhance cgp 12177 cardiostimulation

823

taken together, this suggests that the cardiostimulant effects
of cgp 12177a are mediated by a novel low-affinity site or
state of the b1-adrenoceptor, previously attributed to a
separate b4-adrenoceptor. the use of beta-blockers in the
treatment of ischaemic heart disease and heart failure is
widespread. it will be important to determine whether betablockers with partial agonist activity at the low-affinity state of
the b1-adrenoceptor are implicated in arrhythmogenesis or a
lack of benefit in treatment of heart failure.
