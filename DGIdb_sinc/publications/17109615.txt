antiestrogens, principally tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors have been used
as the first- and second-line therapy in patients with advanced postmenopausal breast cancer for many years. however, some patients acquire resistance to
these treatments and, at present, further endocrine treatment is achieved by
merely substituting the current medication with a different antiestrogen or
aromatase inhibitor.  xxxd3436xxx  offers an alternative endocrine treatment due
to its unique mode of action. it is an allosteric modulator of the estrogen
receptor and targets both the estrogen- and growth factor-dependent pathways through which estradiol stimulates cell proliferation. in clinical trials,
 xxxd3436xxx  has been shown to be an effective treatment for breast cancer in
patients who have relapsed after receiving treatment with one or more forms
of endocrine therapy. ongoing and future clinical trials are examining the
potential for the use of  xxxd3436xxx  in premenopausal breast cancer, as well as in
other malignancies such as prostate cancer.

introduction

it has been over 100 years since beatson first discovered that oophorectomy
resulted in breast cancer regression in a premenopausal patient [1]. once it had been
discovered that this was due to the action of estrogens through an  xxxg730xxx 
(er) [2], therapeutics were developed that either directly targeted the er [3] or disrupted the production of estrogen through the inhibition of steroidogenesis [4].
generally, it is quite clear that different endocrine therapies produce equivalent
response rates and response durations [5], but the eventual development of
resistance to treatment is universal.
the antiestrogen tamoxifen has been widely used for the treatment of early and
advanced breast cancer for the past 30 years [6]. patients with er-positive tumours
receive this drug either as adjuvant treatment following surgery or as first-line treatment for advanced disease [7]. however, up to 40% of patients that receive
tamoxifen will experience resistance to treatment [7]. multi-drug resistance is
thought to occur through the efflux of drugs via membrane transporter proteins.
more specifically, resistance to endocrine therapy is a progressive phenomenon that
causes endocrine-responsive cells to develop a non-responsive phenotype. it is
thought that breast cancer cells respond to estrogen blockade either by becoming
supersensitive to estrogen or by becoming increasingly dependent on growth factor
signalling. this phenomenon of acquired resistance has also been described for
aromatase inhibitors [7]. however, breast cancer cells can become resistant to one
form of hormonal therapy, but remain responsive to another hormonal agent. this
is evident from the responsiveness to further endocrine treatment observed after
resistance has developed to tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors [7]. in this situation, tamoxifen resistance is a feature of receptor blockade rather than the development of a multi-drug resistant phenotype. furthermore, long-term treatment has
been associated with an increase in endometrial cancer [8,9]. consequently, it has

 xxxd3436xxx 

been considered desirable to introduce new endocrine therapies to overcome these difficulties. other drugs acting on the
ligand binding site have been used with varying degrees of
success [10], but more recently inhibitors of aromatase activity
have received the most attention [11]. following tamoxifen
failure, treatment with the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole or  xxxd2459xxx ) has been shown to be effective,
but eventually many patients will become resistant to these
drugs leaving few remaining endocrine treatment options [12].
for this reason,  xxxd3436xxx  is emerging as an important
novel therapeutic option for patients with advanced breast
cancer who have initially responded and then failed on both
antiestrogen and aromatase inhibitor therapy. it is thought
that the value of  xxxd3436xxx  as a third-line therapeutic agent lies
in its novel mode of action.
 xxxd3436xxx  was first introduced as an inhibitor of
3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase blocking the conversion
of
∆5-3beta-hydroxysteroids,
including
pregnenolone,
17alpha-oh-pregnenolone and  xxxd2996xxx , to
the ∆4-3-ketosteroids, progesterone, 17alpha-oh-progesterone
and androstenedione. as  xxxd3436xxx  blocks this early stage of
steroidogenesis, it affects the biosynthesis of all classes of steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids,
progesterone, androgens and estrogens [13]. although originally
postulated to be an aromatase inhibitor [14], this was subsequently shown not to be the case [15].  xxxd3436xxx  was first used
in breast cancer to inhibit adrenal steroid synthesis of androstenedione and testosterone, which may be converted to estrogens by aromatase activity. however, recent studies have shown
that  xxxd3436xxx  has a further, unique mode of action that suggests that it is a useful endocrine therapeutic, even after endocrine tumours become resistant to both antiestrogens and
aromatase inhibitors.
2.

 xxxd3436xxx : novel mode of action

endocrine-responsive breast tumours contain ers through
which estrogens produce their physiological actions [16]. their
response to endocrine treatment can be predicted by the level of
receptor expression in these tumours [17]. it was thought that all
of the biological actions of estradiol were originally presumed to
be through a single er, termed  xxxg730xxx . with the discovery of
the second isoform,  xxxg731xxx  [18], the biology of estrogens and
antiestrogens has become more complex. owing to the high
degree of homology between the two er subtypes, these receptors bind estrogen and antiestrogens similarly, and interact with
the same estrogen response elements (eres) in the promoter
regions of target genes. however, their differential tissue expression suggests that they have different physiological roles [19].
studies have now been performed to determine the interaction
of  xxxd3436xxx  with these two forms of receptor.
recent evidence now shows that  xxxd3436xxx  has a direct
effect on breast cancer cells [20]. first, estrogen-stimulated
proliferation of these cells is blocked by  xxxd3436xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner, with significant inhibition being
2414

observed at 1 and 10 µm. second, in rat uterus preparations,
rather than displacing estradiol binding to er,  xxxd3436xxx  actually enhanced the overall affinity and specifically enhanced binding to  xxxg731xxx . this shows a novel mode of action in that, unlike
other selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms) [21],
 xxxd3436xxx  is a noncompetitive allosteric er modulator. this
allosteric control has a major effect on the transcriptional
activity of the er. in a cell-based, ere-luciferase reporter
assay,  xxxd3436xxx  blocked estrogen-stimulated gene transcription. this was due to a direct interaction of  xxxd3436xxx  with
both  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx , as demonstrated by the ability of  xxxd3436xxx  to inhibit estrogen-enhanced binding of pure recombinant er to a classical ere in an electromobility shift assay
that detects protein–dna interactions [20].
extending these concepts, barker et al. have shown that in
rats, 7-day treatment with  xxxd3436xxx  4 mg/kg/day produces an
increase in the ratio of  xxxg731xxx  to  xxxg730xxx , but does not result in
increased overall expression of er in the uteri of treated animals [22]. gene arrays highlight the difference in the mode of
action of  xxxd3436xxx  and tamoxifen. whereas treatment of
breast cancer cells with either tamoxifen or  xxxd3436xxx  affected
transcription of various genes (involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion and matrix proteins), there was a significant set of genes
regulated by  xxxd3436xxx , that were not affected by tamoxifen; in
particular,  xxxd3436xxx  uniquely upregulated  xxxg731xxx  [22].
estrogens are thought to affect tumour growth via two
main pathways. the classical pathway is via ers that act
through eres in order to activate gene transcription. it is
thought that if this pathway is blocked by drugs such as
tamoxifen, a second pathway is utilised by estrogen, in
which the er interacts with c-jun and c-fos to promote gene
transcription through  xxxg1222xxx  sites in the promoter regions of
genes involved in cell proliferation. this pathway has been
called the ‘cell survival pathway’ and may explain how cancer cells acquire resistance to endocrine treatment.  xxxd3436xxx 
has been shown experimentally to act as a negative modulator of this pathway (unlike tamoxifen, which may increase
 xxxg1222xxx  activity) and is able to reduce transcriptional activity in
the presence of estrogen [22,23].
thus,  xxxd3436xxx  inhibits not only steroidogenesis, but also
er activity, and at the same time promotes  xxxg731xxx  expression.
this is particularly significant because  xxxg731xxx  acts as a modulator of  xxxg730xxx  activity [24]. bardin et al. reviewed studies of
er subtype expression and demonstrated that disease progression is associated with an increase in  xxxg730xxx  expression,
which is coincident with a decrease in  xxxg731xxx  [25]. it is
thought that the loss of the modulating activity of  xxxg731xxx  is,
in part, responsible for the progression of breast disease;
indeed, acquired tamoxifen resistance has been shown to be
associated with decreased  xxxg731xxx  levels [26].
therefore, the beneficial action of  xxxd3436xxx  in advanced
postmenopausal breast cancer arises from a combination of its
ability to directly inhibit er–ere- and er– xxxg1222xxx -mediated
transcriptional activity, increasing the expression of  xxxg731xxx  and
suppressing steroidogenesis.

pharmacokinetics

 xxxd3436xxx  (figure 1) is widely distributed after oral administration. it is also metabolised by the liver, producing the
major metabolite, 17-ketotrilostane, which is excreted by the
kidney [27].
in phase i studies in healthy males, robinson et al. showed
that in 10 subjects, a single dose of  xxxd3436xxx  120 mg resulted
in a mean cmax of 0.56 µg/ml (1.7 µm) [27]. furthermore, both
the parent compound and the major metabolite 17-ketotrilostane were detected, and the latter was present at three-times the
concentration of the parent compound. in fact, in a functional
assay, 17-ketotrilostane was more potent than the parent compound in inhibiting 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.
pharmacokinetic studies in the rat have shown that  xxxd3436xxx 
and 17-ketotrilostane undergo metabolic interconversion, suggesting that  xxxd3436xxx  availability is conserved in the body [28].
another two studies by powles et al. and brown et al. have
reported similar levels, finding 1.0 µg/ml (3.04 µm) and
0.48 µg/ml (1.46 µm) of  xxxd3436xxx , respectively, after the
administration of 120 mg doses [29,30].
 xxxd3436xxx  is indicated for use in postmenopausal cancer
at a dose of 720 – 960 mg/day. this is up to eight-times the
dose used in the pharmacokinetic trials. it is therefore clear
that the circulating concentration of  xxxd3436xxx  will exceed
the concentration used in the in vitro studies (3.29 µg/ml).
both  xxxd3436xxx  and 17-ketotrilostane are cleared from
the blood within 6 – 8 h, and the half-life of both
compounds is 1.2 h.

 xxxd3436xxx  in breast cancer

many studies demonstrate the efficacy of  xxxd3436xxx  as a treatment of advanced postmenopausal breast cancer [31-38]. in particular, they indicate that  xxxd3436xxx  can provide a treatment
option even after patients have failed in three or more
previous endocrine treatments.
in the first study undertaken to examine the efficacy of
 xxxd3436xxx  in the treatment of advanced breast disease,
patients were either postmenopausal or had x-ray-induced
artificial menopause, and had evidence of disease progression after either chemotherapy or previous endocrine therapy [33]. patients received increasing doses of up to
960 mg/day after 7 days with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone to prevent glucocorticoid deficiency. using the international union against cancer (uicc) criteria [39],
23 patients were assessed. of these, 26% had an objective
response and 13% had stable disease. these patients were
not selected on the basis of er status.
murray and pitt investigated the effectiveness of  xxxd3436xxx  in
patients who had previously been treated with tamoxifen [31]. in
total, 75 postmenopausal or post-oophorectomy women with
actively progressing cancer were treated with doses of up to
960 mg/day that were supplemented with standard physiological
glucocorticoid treatment. responses were classified according

to uicc criteria. of the 60 assessable patients, 36.6% had an
objective remission and 18.3% had a stabilisation of previously progressing disease. the response was most marked in
those patients who had previously responded to tamoxifen,
with 48% having an objective response. the median duration
of response to  xxxd3436xxx  was 12.5 months.
it is more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of  xxxd3436xxx 
after prior treatment with aromatase inhibitors, as these studies
were performed on patients who had received the first-generation inhibitor  xxxd147xxx . in a multi-centre crossover
study, it was clear that there was no cross-resistance between
 xxxd3436xxx  and tamoxifen, in that, of 47 patients who received
both drugs, 19% showed a response to both [37]. regardless of
the sequence of the crossover, both groups had the same
response rate and the same time to disease progression. the
clinical benefit rate for evaluable patients who received  xxxd3436xxx  after prior  xxxd147xxx  treatment was 33%,
although this equated to one responder in three evaluable
patients. a phase iv clinical trial of 61 patients is presently
ongoing to assess the efficacy of using  xxxd3436xxx  after prior therapy with third-generation aromatase inhibitors. the results of
this trial are due to be reported in 2007.
an analysis of 10 clinical trials has been performed that
includes a total of 714 patients receiving full-dose  xxxd3436xxx 
with a low-dose glucorticoid (table 1) [40]. all of the trials
were conducted under similar protocols, so it was possible to
perform a meta-analysis of the data. overall, 92% of the subjects had received prior endocrine therapy and 43% had
received prior chemotherapy. the analysis revealed that  xxxd3436xxx  gave a 46% clinical benefit rate in patients who had
received prior endocrine therapy and a 43% clinical benefit
rate in those patients who had received at least three endocrine treatments (but no chemotherapy). er status was an
important determinant for clinical benefit, with a 38.2%
response in er-positive patients, but only a 15.2% response
in the er-negative group. the median duration of clinical
benefit, including stabilisation of disease was 41 weeks.
side effects
all of the studies reported minor side effects associated with
 xxxd3436xxx  and glucocorticoid treatment. the main side effects
were gastrointestinal in origin, with 32% of patients experiencing upper gastrointestinal side effects, mainly gastritis,
nausea and vomiting. diarrhoea occurred as a dose-related
side effect in 17% of patients.
in one study, the concomitant administration of nsaids
significantly reduced the incidence of diarrhoea; 2 (9%) of 21
patients taking nsaids had diarrhoea compared with
23 (35%) of 66 patients not taking nsaids. closer examination of the meta-analysis study of 714 patients found that
those taking nsaids (n = 84) had significantly less diarrhoea
(6%) than those not taking nsaids (19%).
serious upper gastrointestinal problems, including peptic
ulcer and erosive gastritis, can occur in some patients. the causal
relationship of these events to  xxxd3436xxx  or glucocorticoid was

unclear, but  xxxd3436xxx  therapy can be continued if nsaid
dosage is reduced and an h2 blocker is added to the treatment.
gastric perforation, haematemesis and melaena have been
reported to occur in patients receiving nsaids and  xxxd3436xxx .
a small number of patients experienced granulocytopenia,
which appeared within 4 – 8 weeks, but was reversible, with
recovery occurring ∼ 4 weeks after therapy was stopped.
it has also been reported that some patients complain of
oral paraesthesia, and that this can cause issues with compliance. however, this response is transient and has been
overcome by administering the drug in increasing doses
that gradually build up to the full dose (720 – 960 mg/day)
over 10 days.
precautions
as  xxxd3436xxx  suppresses the production of progesterone, it is
essential to ensure that pregnancy is excluded and that
non-hormonal contraceptive methods are used during the
therapy, when appropriate.

 xxxd3436xxx  in adrenocortical hyperfunction

as described earlier,  xxxd3436xxx  is an inhibitor of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/∆5,4-isomerase and has been used for
many years to treat cushing’s syndrome as it inhibits the
production of cortisol by the adrenal gland [37-39]. it was
reported in 1978 by komanicky et al. that treatment with
 xxxd3436xxx  (200 – 1000 mg/day) resulted in reduced cortisol
secretion rate and plasma cortisol in seven patients with
cushing’s syndrome (one patient had an adrenocortical carcinoma and the others all presented with pituitary-dependent disease) [41]. other studies have also assessed the value of
 xxxd3436xxx  in the treatment of cushing’s syndrome, and have
reported less favourable results [42,43]. however, this agent
has been very successful in treating pituitary-dependent
hyperadrenocorticism in animals [44-46], and is particularly
effective in dogs at doses of 5 – 50 mg/kg/day [44].
 xxxd3436xxx  has also been used to treat hyperaldosteronism
and has been shown to be a feasible therapeutic option for

long-term treatment of hyperaldosteronism in humans,
caused by either aldosterone-producing adenomas or adrenal
hyperplasia [47,48]. treatment with 240 mg/day can correct
both hypokalaemia and hyperaldosteronism and can reduce
diastolic blood pressure [43].
although  xxxd3436xxx  seems to have varied success in inhibiting steroidogenesis, it has recently been shown that this agent
may also produce its effects through altered glucocorticoid
receptor expression in the livers of rats treated for 7 days with
 xxxd3436xxx  4 mg/kg/day [49].
6.

future perspective

the allosteric action of  xxxd3436xxx  on ers is most active when
the er is also bound to its ligand, estradiol. this has obvious
implications for a potential application of  xxxd3436xxx  in the
treatment of premenopausal breast cancer; therefore, premenopausal breast cancer patients are being recruited for a
phase ii trial to determine its effectiveness. this study, which
began in 2005, is a single-arm, open-label study that will
assess 41 er-positive, premenopausal patients who have
relapsed or are refractory to hormone therapies of tamoxifen,
 xxxd2229xxx  and an aromatase inhibitor. it is anticipated that the
results of this study will be available in 2007.
as  xxxd3436xxx  is an  xxxg731xxx  modulator, there has also been
interest in studying its role in prostate cancer. the prostate
tissue is known to express high levels of  xxxg731xxx  and it has been
suggested that prostatic tumours could be a target for  xxxd3436xxx  [50]. a phase ii open-label study of  xxxd3436xxx  in androgen-independent prostate cancer was recently undertaken in
the us. this limited study of 20 patients indicated that some
of the patients showed a response to the treatment. as assessed
by a significant reduction (> 50%) in  xxxg1281xxx 
levels. however, it is clear that these promising results will
need a much larger study to be performed before it will be

possible to determine whether  xxxd3436xxx  could become an
alternative treatment in prostate cancer.
7.

expert opinion

these data show that  xxxd3436xxx  is an agent that should be considered in the management of hormone-sensitive advanced
breast cancer.  xxxd3436xxx  has comparable rates of clinical benefit
and objective response to those seen with aromatase inhibitors
in second-line therapy. its distinctive mode of action sets it apart
from conventional antiestrogens in that it allows a two-pronged
attack against breast cancer by negative modulation of genes
regulated by both ere and ap-1. furthermore, because it is
effective in the presence of estrogen, it could also be a candidate
for use in premenopausal patients who have to be treated with
harsh regimens of chemotherapy. however, until reports from
the current ongoing trials are reported, this remains a theoretical
application. finally, it is accepted that as therapy proceeds,
tumour cells can undergo a process of phenotypic selection that
can lead to resistance to the first-line therapy.  xxxd3436xxx  has
been shown to benefit patients with advanced postmenopausal
breast cancer, whose disease continues to progress after becoming resistant to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. this suggests that the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3436xxx  on the alternative
growth factor-mediated cell survival pathway may be the key to
the extra benefit that has been observed with this agent, and
implies that  xxxd3436xxx  should be considered as a third-line therapy after patients have progressed through treatment with both
antiestrogen and aromatase inhibitors. thus,  xxxd3436xxx  should
be considered as a treatment for postmenopausal patients with
advanced breast cancer who have previously been responsive to
tamoxifen and subsequently become refractory to at least one
form of prior endocrine therapy, and this treatment should continue as the patients continue to respond, or the disease remains
stable on treatment.
