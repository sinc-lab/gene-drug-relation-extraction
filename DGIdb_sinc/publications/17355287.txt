in humans, b-alanine (bal) and the neurotransmitter c-aminobutyrate
(gaba) are transaminated by a single aminotransferase enzyme. apparently, yeast originally also had a single enzyme, but the corresponding gene
was duplicated in the saccharomyces kluyveri lineage. skuga1 encodes a
homologue of saccharomyces cerevisiae  xxxg8xxx , and
skpyd4 encodes an enzyme involved in both bal and gaba transamination. skpyd4 and skuga1 as well as s. cerevisiae uga1 and schizosaccharomyces pombe uga1 were subcloned, over-expressed and puriﬁed.
one discontinuous and two continuous coupled assays were used to characterize the substrate speciﬁcity and kinetic parameters of the four enzymes.
it was found that the cofactor pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate is needed for enzymatic activity and a-ketoglutarate, and not pyruvate, as the amino group
acceptor. skpyd4p preferentially uses bal as the amino group donor
(vmax ⁄ km ¼ 0.78 uæmg)1æmm)1), but can also use gaba (vmax ⁄ km ¼
0.42 uæmg)1æmm)1), while skuga1p only uses gaba (vmax ⁄ km ¼
4.01 uæmg)1æmm)1). spuga1p and scuga1p transaminate only gaba and
not bal. while mammals degrade bal and gaba with only one
enzyme, but in different tissues, s. kluyveri and related yeasts have two different genes ⁄ enzymes to apparently ‘distinguish’ between the two reactions
in a single cell. it is likely that upon duplication 200 million years ago, a
specialized uga1p evolved into a ‘novel’ transaminase enzyme with broader
substrate speciﬁcity.

in biological systems, b-alanine (bal) plays a major
role as a precursor of pantothenic acid, as a constituent of dipeptides like anserine and carnosine, and as
an intermediate in the reductive degradation of pyrimidines. because of its chemical similarity to the major
inhibitory neurotransmitters, c-aminobutyrate (gaba)
and glycine, and its presence in the brain, bal is
thought to have a similar function in animals [1]. in

mammals, uracil is degraded to bal via three consecutive enzymatic steps catalyzed by  xxxg652xxx  ( xxxg652xxx ), dihydropyrimidine
amidohydrolase ( xxxg653xxx ) and b-ureidopropionase
[ec 3.5.1.6]. in microorganisms, other biochemical
pathways also provide bal, e.g. escherichia coli produces bal by direct decarboxylation of aspartate,
while saccharomyces cerevisiae uses the breakdown of

polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx )
[2–4].
mammals degrade bal to malonic semialdehyde
(msa) using either bal:a-ketoglutarate aminotransferase (bal-at,  xxxg8xxx ) or d-3-aminoisobutyrate:pyruvate aminotransferase (dbaib-at,
 xxxg103xxx ). only bal-at activity can be found in
rat brain, and even though d-3-aminoisobutyrate aminotransferase activity is present in rat liver and kidney,
bal-at is the dominant enzyme also in these tissues
[5]. the produced msa is subsequently metabolized
by malonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg139xxx )
to acetyl- xxxd1739xxx  [6–8].
in humans, bal-at and  xxxg8xxx 
activity ( xxxg8xxx ,  xxxg8xxx ) reside within the
same enzyme [9]. the gene is primarily expressed
in brain, liver, pancreas and kidney, and the actual
function in these tissues could be related to substrate
availability, e.g.  xxxg8xxx  in brain (high gaba
concentration) and bal-at in liver (high bal concentration).
even though s. cerevisiae can synthesize bal from
polyamines, it cannot use it as sole nitrogen source
[10]. gaba, on the other hand, is readily used as sole
nitrogen source by the action of  xxxg8xxx  and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg138xxx ), encoded
by uga1 and uga2, respectively [11]. transport of
gaba across the cell membrane is facilitated by the
uga4 gene product [12]. the whole gaba catabolic
pathway is regulated by the transcriptional activator
uga3 [13]. several yeast species, like saccharomyces
kluyveri and schizosaccharomyces pombe can utilize
bal as the sole nitrogen source [14]. s. kluyveri has
recently become a useful model with which to study
degradation of pyrimidines and the biosynthesis of
bal [15,16]. in this yeast, dihydrouracil (dhu) is
degraded to b-ureidopropionate (bup) and further to
bal by enzymes encoded by pyd2 and pyd3,
respectively [17–16]. however, in s. kluyveri, uracil is
apparently not degraded to dhu [18].
in this study, s. kluyveri is employed as a model to
better understand bal degradation and the role of
gene duplication in the origin of modern transaminases. a genetic and enzymatic characterization of a
bal-at (encoded by pyd4) and a  xxxg8xxx  (encoded
by uga1) from s. kluyveri is presented and compared
with  xxxg8xxx  from s. pombe and s. cerevisiae. bal
and gaba degradation in s. kluyveri seems to be catalyzed by more specialized enzymes than those found
in mammals, where a single enzyme converts both substrates. both enzymes in the s. kluyveri lineage originated from a gene duplication event, which apparently
took place 200 million years ago.

results
identification of pyd4 gene encoding a b-alanine
aminotransferase
while screening mutagenized s. kluyveri cells on dhu
plates, a mutant, y947 (mata ura3 pyd41), which
could not use dhu, bup or bal, but could use uracil as a sole nitrogen source, was isolated. this mutant
behaved like a double mutant, since both bup and
bal can serve as a direct nitrogen source via the
action of b-ureidopropionase or bal-at enzymes.
however, complementation with the genomic library
yielded plasmid p733, which supported growth on all
three nitrogen sources (dhu, bup and bal). an
orf, termed pyd4 (dq512721), encoding a protein
with 55% identity at the protein level to s. cerevisiae
uga1 gene product,  xxxg8xxx , was identiﬁed. a
blast search of scuga1 in the s. kluyveri genome
[19] revealed another homologous gene, termed
skuga1 (dq512722). its gene product has 80% identity to scuga1p, and 57% to skpyd4p. knockout
strains of both genes, pyd4 and uga1, were constructed in different genetic backgrounds (table 1).
two double mutants (y1154 and y1155) were made
from crossing and sporulation of y1042 (duga1) and
y1048 (dpyd4) (table 1). strains were tested for their
ability to utilize dhu, bup, bal and gaba as
nitrogen sources (table 2). the y1048 (dpyd4) strain
showed low growth on bal. in contrast to y947
(pyd41), however, it could grow on both dhu and
bup. transformation of y1048 (dpyd4) with p733,
restored wild-type growth on media with bal as sole
nitrogen source. y1042 (duga1) showed decreased
growth on gaba, but was able to grow on the other
nitrogen sources tested. the double mutants y1154
(dpyd4 duga1) and y1155 (dpyd4 duga1) showed
decreased growth on both bal and gaba as sole
nitrogen source. the results in table 2 suggest that
skpyd4 is primarily involved in bal degradation,
but also has some inﬂuence on gaba degradation.
skuga1, on the other hand, is only involved in
gaba degradation. the remaining poor growth on
bal and gaba, when both genes are disrupted, indicates the presence of some additional background
transaminase activity in the cells.
sequence analysis of pyd genes
phylogenetic analysis of homologous proteins from
yeast shows that the pyd4 protein is only found in two
other sequenced yeasts (debaryomyces hansenii and
candida albicans). both yeasts also contain a putative

uga1p encoding gene. when a search for  xxxg653xxx  and b-ureidopropionase encoding genes
was performed, it was found that s. kluyveri is the
only yeast having all three genes, c. albicans and
d. hansenii lack pyd2, and kluyveromyces lactis
has pyd2 and pyd3, but lacks pyd4 (table 3). a
phylogenetic tree of all pyd4 ⁄ uga1 homologous proteins found in fungi with mammalian bal-at and
dbaib-at is shown in fig. 1. sccar2p (ornithine
aminotransferase from s. cerevisiae) and scarg8p
1806

(acetylornithine aminotransferase from s. cerevisiae)
are included to illustrate general phylogenetic relationships. apparently, pyd4 and uga4 originate from a
duplication event which took place prior to the separation of the s. cerevisiae, s. kluyveri, c. albicans and
d. hansenii lineages.
cloning and expression
the pyd4 and uga1 genes from s. kluyveri, s. cerevisiae and s. pombe were subcloned. four expression
plasmids (pet151-skpyd4, pet151-skuga1, pet151scuga1 and pet151-spuga1, respectively) were
constructed using the pet151 ⁄ d-topo cloning
system. sequence analysis conﬁrmed correct cloning
without mutations, except for scuga1. here a single
mutation (719 a > g) was found resulting in an
exchange of histidine for arginine (h240r) when compared with the reference sequence np_011533. in the
original published sequence, position 719 is a guanine
not an adenine [20]. this is also noted in the swissprot
entry p17649 (even though the actual protein sequence
in this entry has a histidine at position 240). our
scuga1 sequence has been deposited in genbank
(dq512723). all the other yeast uga1 proteins used in
the phylogenetic analysis including s. pombe have an

to dimers. scuga1 and skuga1 proteins were both

seen as dimers (113 and 135 kda, respectively) and
tetramers (225 and 240 kda, respectively).
the spectrum of puriﬁed skpyd4p showed two maxima at 340 and 410 nm, as well as the 280 nm absorbance for aromatic amino acids. when the protein was
dialysed against three portions of 1 l buffer s in the
absence of plp, the 340 ⁄ 410 nm absorption maxima
disappeared (data not shown), indicating that the
cofactor is not bound very tightly. the apoprotein
(without the 340 ⁄ 410 nm absorption) was inactive.
when plp was added to the apoprotein, the
340 ⁄ 410 nm absorption reappeared and the protein
regained full activity (data not shown). in the reconstituted skpyd4p, the 410 nm absorbance indicates the
formation of the schiff base of the formyl group of
plp with the e-amino group of an active-site lysine
residue of the protein. when the ph was varied
between 6.6 and 8.6, a ph-dependent change of these
maxima was observed (fig. 2), indicating a change in the
equilibrium of the ketoenamine and enolimine tautomers.

reaction interferes with the glutamate detection, which
can only be overcome by quenching akg with large
amounts of hydrazine. second, the determination of
msa in a continuous coupled assay using malonic
semialdehyde decarboxylase (msadc) and alcohol
dehydrogenase is very sensitive and easy to execute.
the msa produced in the skpyd4p reaction is converted
to acetaldehyde which, in a third reaction, is coupled
to the nadh-dependent  xxxg110xxx 
reaction resulting in ethanol and nad+, observed in
the disappearance of nadh at 340 nm [21].
in the initial reaction of skuga1p, scuga1p and
skuga1p, akg and gaba are converted to glutamate
and ssa. in a second reaction, either the amount of
glutamate (see above) or that of ssa is determined.
when gaba is used as amino acceptor, the formation
of ssa is followed by reaction with  xxxg138xxx  in a very
sensitive, continuous coupled assay, observing the formation of nadh at 340 nm.
ph optimum, enzyme stability and substrate
specificity

initial velocity studies
in the initial reaction of skpyd4p, a-ketoglutarate
(akg) and bal (or gaba) are converted to glutamate and msa (or succinic semialdehyde, ssa),
respectively (fig. 3). in a second reaction, either the
amount of glutamate or that of msa or ssa was
determined.
firstly, the determination of glutamate is a discontinous assay using glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh),
which would have the advantage that both bal and
gaba can be used as amino acceptors. however, it
bears the great disadvantage that akg used in the ﬁrst

measurements on skpyd4p were performed at different
ph values (data not shown). the ph optimum was
determined to be close to 8.0, with 70% of activity
remaining at ph values of 7 and 9. after storage of
skpyd4p at 4 c for 12 days, 57% activity could still
be recovered.
the substrate speciﬁcity of the four enzymes to use
either bal or gaba as an amino donor was tested
and the results are summarized in table 4. there are
only minor differences in the relative activities of
bal-at determined by the two methods, but, in
general, skpyd4p is more active with bal, while the
other three enzymes show almost only  xxxg8xxx 
activity and very little bal-at activity. in addition,
all enzymes use akg and not pyruvate as amino
acceptor.

both skpyd4p and skuga1p were subjected to a full
kinetic analysis. since skuga1p showed only very little
activity towards bal, only skpyd4p was analyzed
with both substrates, bal and gaba. as the coupled
assays for pyd4p (msadc) and uga1p ( xxxg138xxx ) are
much more reliable than the discontinuous assay using
gdh, these assay systems were used to determine the
respective kinetic parameters (table 5). note that the
standard errors are much lower for the continuous
assays when compared with those of the discontinuous
assays.

when the velocity was determined at various akg
concentrations and several ﬁxed levels of bal, the velocity pattern in fig. 4a was obtained. the pattern is

composed of parallel lines at low reactant concentrations. the pattern shown in fig. 4a,b gave calculated values of 8.2 ± 0.4 mm, 2.9 ± 0.2 mm and
6.4 ± 0.2 uæmg)1 for kbal, kakg, and vmax, respectively. at high akg concentrations, the linear lines are
deﬂected upwards, indicating substrate inhibition. the
inhibition constant calculated for akg is 28.3 ±
6.7 mm. with gaba as substrate skpyd4p gives calculated values of 1.8 ± 0.2 mm, 0.18 ± 0.02 mm and 0.75 ±
0.03 uæmg)1 for kgaba, kakg and vmax, respectively.
as the maximal velocity of skpyd4p is more than eight
times higher for bal, skpyd4p can be considered a
bal-at rather than a  xxxg8xxx . skuga1p, on the
other hand, reveals similar initial velocity pattern (data
not shown), with calculated values of 3.2 ± 0.2 mm,
0.22 ± 0.01 mm and 12.8 ± 0.3 uæmg)1 for kgaba,
kakg, and vmax, respectively. the activity of skuga1p
is so low (table 4) that detailed parameters could not
be determined.

discussion
identification of a novel bal-at-encoding gene
duplication is one of the main sources of new genes.
the majority of duplicated copies is sooner or later
lost from the genome, however, both copies can be
preserved if they develop: (a) a different expression
pattern (regulation), (b) divide the original function
between them, or (c) if one of the copies develops a
new function. the genes and enzymes involved in
metabolism of nucleic acid precursors represent a very
useful model with which to study the origin of new
genes and enzymes through the duplication events [22].
mammals have only one gene encoding a  xxxg8xxx ,
which exhibits both bal-at and  xxxg8xxx  activity.
1810

s. cerevisiae has only one gene encoding a  xxxg8xxx 
(scuga1), while s. kluyveri has two scuga1-like genes.
similarly, the genomes of c. albicans and d. hansenii
seem to contain two uga1-like genes (fig. 1). this study
identiﬁes that one of the two genes in s. kluyveri,
skpyd4 is a bal-at involved in bal degradation.
the orf of pyd4 could complement a pyd41 mutant
unable to grow on dhu, bup and bal as sole nitrogen
source. similarly, a strain with the disrupted gene
(dpyd4) could also be complemented for the pyd4 defect.
this demonstrates that dhu is indeed degraded ﬁrst to
bup and then further to bal and msa. however,
pyd41 does not necessarily have a defect in the pyd4
gene, and apparently represents a pleiotropic mutation
affecting several functions in the cell, among them proper
functioning of pyd4 (table 2).

g. andersen et al.

close homologues of skpyd4 can be found in two
other yeast strains, d. hansenii and c. albicans, along
with homologues of pyd3 but not pyd2 (table 3). a
more closely related species (k. lactis) does not have
the pyd4 gene, but has both pyd2 and pyd3 homologous genes, while y. lipolytica has no homologous
genes. apparently, the original pyd4 ⁄ uga1 gene was
duplicated in one yeast lineage. later on, one of the
duplicated genes was lost in some descendant lineages,
such as s. cerevisiae. the time point for the gene
duplication is estimated to be 200 million years ago,
when yarrowia lipolytica split from the saccharomyces ⁄ candida ⁄ debaryomyces lineages [23].
gene duplication and specialization
we could show that skuga1 is equivalent to scuga1, both by phylogenetic relationship and by the phenotype of a targeted disruption. in mammals, bal-at
and  xxxg8xxx  activity derive from the same geneproduct. the presence of two separate genetic loci in
s. kluyveri for enzymes with distinct substrate speciﬁcity
indicates a recent duplication of a bal ⁄  xxxg8xxx  into
the specialized pyd4 and uga1 gene(s). the function
of the preduplicated gene can be either bal-at or
 xxxg8xxx , or both. to test this hypothesis, skuga1p,
skpyd4p, scuga1p and spuga1p were characterized.
the s. pombe homologue was believed to be an example
of a preduplicated unspecialized gene, as it is the only
homologous gene in the genome and falls phylogenetically outside the skuga1 and skpyd4 branch (fig. 1).
spuga1p showed only  xxxg8xxx  activity (table 4),
which suggests that the duplicated progenitor gene was
likely to be encoding a  xxxg8xxx , and that skpyd4
represents a neofunctionalization of one of the two copies of the yeast bal-at [24]. these results are a little
surprising, as s. pombe, like s. kluyveri, can use bal as
its sole nitrogen source (j. stolz, department of cell
biology and plant physiology, universität regensburg,
germany, personal communication). however, alternative transaminases or other enzymes may degrade bal.
alternative routes for bal ⁄ gaba degradation are found
in ustilago maydis, where a gene disruption of the ugata
locus encoding a putative uga1 protein decreases the
growth on bal but not on gaba [25].
characterization of skpyd4p and skuga1p
the absorption spectra of both proteins showed maxima
at 330 and 410 nm, indicating the schiff base of pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate bound to an active-site lysine, typical
for all aminotransferases [26]. the two maxima reﬂected
the equilibrium between enolimine (330 nm) and keto-

origin of yeast aminotransferases

enamine (410 nm) tautomers of the internal aldimine,
which is ph dependent [27]. at higher ph values there
was a decrease in absorbance at 410 nm and a slight
increase at 330 nm. the spectral change could be the
result of deprotonation of the internal aldimine at high
ph. sequence alignment of skpyd4p with e. coli
 xxxg8xxx  deduced that the active-site lysine of
skpyd4p forming the schiff base is k330 [28]. the apoenzyme of skpyd4p could be obtained by exhaustive
dialysis of the protein against buffer without plp, which
indicated that the cofactor was not very tightly bound.
full enzymatic activity could be restored upon addition
of free plp. to keep the protein fully saturated with
cofactor, plp was present during all puriﬁcation steps.
based on the amino acid sequence, identities in all
four enzymes, skpyd4p, skuga1p, scuga1p and scuga1p, belong to the aminotransferase evolutionary
subgroup ii [29]. the lysine (k 330 in skpyd4p) forming
the schiff base linkage to the cofactor, the amino acid
stabilizing the nitrogen of the pyridoxal moiety ( xxxd299xxx  in
skpyd4p) and the arginines (r196 and r449 in
skpyd4p) involved in the binding of the carboxyl groups
of the substrates are all conserved. in other words, the
three-dimensional structures are most likely to be very
similar to other enzymes in this subgroup ii, such as
 xxxg8xxx  from e. coli, dialkylglycine
decarboxylase and  xxxg1621xxx  [30,31].
initial velocity studies
the enzymatic activity of both skpyd4p and skuga1p
was determined in a coupled assay system using
msadc and  xxxg138xxx , respectively. the coupled assay
systems were far superior to the discontinuous assay
using gdh, which was too tedious and adequate only
at certain low akg concentration ranges. it ﬁrst had
to be established that skpyd4p preferentially accepts
akg and not pyruvate as a keto substrate.
for a classical bireactant enzyme, such as skpyd4p
and skuga1p, two classes of kinetic mechanism, sequential and ping pong, are possible. the pattern of an array
of parallel lines for different ﬁxed concentrations of the
second substrate shown in fig. 4a,b are consistent with
a ping-pong mechanism. all aminotransferases adhere
to a ping-pong mechanism, where the keto substrates
exert substrate inhibition. both skpyd4p and skuga1p
show a reaction mechanism involving two half-reactions. in the ﬁrst half-reaction, the amino group is transferred from bal or gaba to the internal aldimine of
plp, forming a semialdehyde and pyridoxamine
5¢-phosphate. in the second half-reaction, the amino
group of pyridoxamine 5¢-phosphate is transferred to
akg, forming glutamate and restoring plp [30,31].

for skuga1p, km values for bal, gaba and akg
are in the millimolar range, very similar to the corresponding values for  xxxg8xxx  from e. coli, with
kgaba, kakg and kcat of 5.8 ± 0.4 mm, 1.07 ±
0.05 mm and 47.4 ± 1.0 s)1, respectively [31]. the catalytic efﬁciency (vmax ⁄ kgaba) of skuga1p for gaba
as substrate is 10 times higher than that of skpyd4p
(4 versus 0.41). the catalytic efﬁciency of skpyd4p for
bal as substrate is only two times higher than for
gaba as substrate (0.78 versus 0.41). the binding of
akg is much tighter in skuga1p when compared with
skpyd4p (0.2 versus 2.9). the same is true when comparing the binding of bal and gaba as substrate for
skpyd4p and skuga1p (8.2 versus 3.2).
both skpyd4p and  xxxg8xxx  from e. coli show
comparable substrate inhibition for akg with inhibition constants of 28.3 ± 6.7 and 10.2 ± 2.3 mm [30],
respectively.
downstream reactions
because s. kluyveri can utilize bal as a sole nitrogen
source, an efﬁcient system for degradation of the product msa is likely to be present. in mammals and bacteria, msa is converted to acetyl- xxxd1739xxx  by
methylmalonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, normally
associated with valine metabolism [6,32]. in the soil bacterium pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, a msadc was
recently identiﬁed as one of the enzymes involved in
trans-1,3-dichloropropene catabolism [21]. msadc
converts msa into acetaldehyde and co2 (note that this
enzymatic reaction was utilized in the bal-at assay)
and the acetaldehyde could be reduced to ethanol by
 xxxg110xxx . however, there are no homologues of methylmalonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
or msadc found in the s. kluyveri genome. another
possibility would be oxidation of msa to malonate by a
msa dehydrogenase in a reaction similar to ssa to succinate catalyzed by  xxxg138xxx . there are two s. kluyveri
scuga2 homologous genes in the genome nucleotide sequence deposited at ncbi (termed uga2a
and termed uga2b with the accession numbers
aace02000036 : 11053.12537 and aace02000070 :
4699.6216, respectively). however, further characterization of these genes and their products is necessary to
understand the whole metabolic pathway.

acids and ammonium sulfate were obtained from difco
(bd biosciences, san jose, ca, usa) and chelating sepharose fast ﬂow from amersham biosciences (piscataway,
nj, usa). oligos were purchased from dna technology
(aarhus, denmark).

strains and media
the yeast and bacterial strains used in this study are presented in table 1. the strains were grown in ypd medium (1%
yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose) or synthetic
deﬁned medium (1%  xxxd3251xxx , 0.6% sodium hydroxide,
2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids
and ammonium sulfate) supplemented with different nitrogen sources (0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% for all other
types). for solid medium (plates), 2% agar was added. all
percentages are w ⁄ v. for plasmid rescue, e. coli strain xl1blue (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa) was used, and for cloning top10 and for overexpression of fusion proteins, bl21
startm (de3, stratagene) was used. all bacteria were grown
at 37 c in lb medium supplemented with ampicillin
(100 mgæl)1) for selection [33].  xxxg418xxx  selection media consisted of ypd supplemented with 75 mgæl)1 of  xxxg418xxx .

mutagenesis
s. kluyveri mutants were generated from the strains y156
and y159 with ethyl methanesulfonate as described in
gojkovic et al. [15]. mutagenized cells were plated on ypd
plates (100–200 colonies per plate) and grown for 2–3 days
at 25 c. the plates were replicated onto new plates containing ammonium sulfate (control) or dhu as sole nitrogen source. after 5–7 days at 25 c, colonies were selected
based on their inability to grow on dhu plates compared
with the control plates. putative mutants were tested for
growth on bup, with bal as sole nitrogen source.

complementation with genomic library
the s. kluyveri wild-type genomic library was prepared by
f. lacroute and was based on the shuttle vector pfl44s
[34]. y947 was transformed with the library dna using the
electroporation procedure [17] and plated on media containing bal as sole nitrogen source for selection. a number of transformants were tested for plasmid loss before
rescue of the plasmid, p733, into e. coli strain xl1-blue.

disruption of the pyd4 and uga1 genes
replacement cassettes with very long ﬂanking homology
regions (500 bp) within the orf were used to disrupt the
two genes. upon correct integration, approximately onethird of the orf (the middle section) would be exchanged
with the resistance cassette. the dominant cassette kanmx3,
which confers  xxxd2191xxx  resistance, was used. pcr ampliﬁcation was performed with pfu polymerase (stratagene) from
wild-type genomic dna (nrrl y-12651) with the following oligonucleotides: pyd4 1–5¢-cctcttattctgtcgc

of the genes, with 25-bp extensions homologous to the kanmx3 marker, and one 1500 bp dna product corresponding
to the kanmx3 cassette. in a second pcr ampliﬁcation, the
two 500 bp parts of the genes were fused to the kanmx3
cassette using the outer primers. the two resulting linear
fragments of each 2500 bp were used to transform s. kluyveri
cells using electroporation as described in gojkovic et al.
[17], and selected on  xxxd2191xxx  plates. correct integration was
conﬁrmed by pcr.

cloning, expression and purification procedures
proteins were expressed using the pet151 ⁄ d-topo expression system (invitrogen k151-01, carlsbad, ca, usa). the
expression vector pet151 adds a 33 amino acid n-terminal
his-tag (mhhhhhhgkpipnpllgldstenlyfqgidpft) to the expressed protein. the following oligonucleotides for skpyd4, skuga1, scuga1 and spuga1
(genbank accession number dq512721, dq512722,
np_011533 and np_594905, respectively) were used:

total dna from s. kluyveri (nrrl y-12651) and
s. cerevisiae (nrrl y-12632) and a commercial cdna
library from s. pombe were used as a template. the cloning
was carried out as described by the manufacturer, and
clones were checked for correct insertion by pcr and
restriction analysis, before sending for sequencing. the
resulting plasmids were termed pet151-skpyd4 (p895),
pet151-skuga1 (p896), pet151-scuga1 (p897) and
pet151-spuga1 (p898).

purification of pyd4p and uga1p
expression
bl-21(de3) was transformed as described by the manufacturer. a preculture was made by inoculation of the transformation in 10 ml lb media (100 lgæml)1 ampicillin,
100 lm plp) and overnight growth (37 c) with shaking.
the preculture was transferred to 1 l of lb media
(100 lgæml)1 ampicillin, 100 lm plp) and the culture was
grown at 37 c with shaking till the od600 was 0.5–0.6.
the temperature was lowered to 25 c, isopropyl b-d-1thiogalactopyranoside was added to a ﬁnal concentration
of 100 lm, and the culture was grown overnight (25 c).
harvesting was carried out by centrifugation at 4225 g for
10 min, and the harvested cells were either stored at )20 c
or processed directly. all procedures involving columns
were run  xxxd1891xxx  c, while all other procedures past the
harvesting were carried out on ice.

cell disruption
the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer [50 mm
potassium phosphate ph 7.0, 300 mm  xxxd2988xxx ,
100 lm plp, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete minus edta
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (roche diagnostics,
basel, switzerland)] and disrupted in a french press
(4 · 1000 psi). cell debris was removed by centrifugation
(24 500 g, 30 min).

streptomycin treatment
streptomycin sulfate (10%) was added dropwise to a ﬁnal
concentration of 2% with stirring. the precipitate was
removed after 30 min by centrifugation (24 500 g,
30 min).

desalting
the solution was desalted on a g-25 column. the column
was equilibrated and run with buffer a (50 mm potassium
phosphate ph 7.0, 300 mm  xxxd2988xxx , 100 lm
plp).

the protein was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (and removal of ni2+ and edta would also be
achieved). finely ground solid ammonium sulfate was
slowly added to obtain 70% saturation [0.472 g (nh4)2so4
per ml protein solution]. the solution was stirred for
15 min prior to centrifugation (24 500 g, 30 min). the precipitated protein was dissolved in 6 ml buffer s (100 mm
potassium phosphate ph 7.0, 100 lm plp).

and vacuum ﬁltered. the washing procedure was repeated
several times. the column material was scraped of the ﬁlter
and mixed with 5 ml of elution buffer (50 mm sodium
phosphate ph 7.0, 300 mm  xxxd3213xxx , 10% glycerol,
500 mm imidazole, 20 mm edta). this mixture was then
transferred to a 10 ml single use syringe, with a ﬁlter
placed at the bottom. the mixture was placed at room temperature for 30 min with regular inversions of the syringe,
before ﬁltering the solution through the syringe. the solution was dispensed in a dialysis tube (10 kda cut-off), covered with absorbent gel matrix, and incubated at 4 c to
concentrate the protein solution. the volume was reduced
to 2 ml before running a ﬁnal gel ﬁltration on an s-12 column. the s-12 gel-ﬁltration column was equilibrated and
run with storage buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate ph 7.0,
10% glycerol). protein fractions were pooled and stored in
200 ll and 2 ml fractions at )80 c.
the gabd gene encoding  xxxg138xxx , cloned in the overexpression plasmid pet23a(+) (p899), was kindly provided
by m. d. toney (university of california, davis, ca, usa).
the puriﬁcation was executed as described previously [30].

gel filtration

protein analysis

a ﬁnal gel-ﬁltration step was used to remove ammonium sulfate. the s-12 gel-ﬁltration column was equilibrated and run
with buffer s. active fractions were pooled. glycerol was
added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10% (w ⁄ v), and protein
was stored in 200 ll and 2 ml fractions at )80 c.

the overexpression vector pet(130) containing the p. pavonaceae 170 orf130 encoding msadc was kindly provided by
c. p. whitman (university of texas, austin, tx, usa) [21].
the gene was cloned into pet101 ⁄ d-topo (invitrogen),
using the 5¢ primer caccatgccacttctcaag and the
3¢ primer gacgaggtccccagtc. the resulting plasmid
(p900) was sequenced. transformation, expression, cell disruption, streptomycin treatment and desalting (g-25 column)
is the same as used for pyd4p and uga1p described above
except all potassium was exchanged for sodium and no plp
was added.

protein concentrations were determined based on the calculated extinction coefﬁcient at 280 nm (http://www.expasy.org/
tools/protparam.html) or by the colorimetric method of bradford using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard [36]. protein
purity and subunit molecular mass determination was carried
out by sds ⁄ page [37]. native protein mass was measured
by running native gel electrophoresis at four different acrylamide concentrations (4, 6, 8 and 10%) in tris-glycine buffer
(ph 8.8). gels were stained with coomassie blue (40% ethanol, 1% acetic acid, 1 gæl)1 r-250 coomassie blue) and
destained with 1% acetic acid. b-amylase (200 kda), bovine
 xxxg124xxx , dimer (132 kda), bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
monomer (66 kda), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kda) were
used as native protein standards. the native size was determined as recommended by the nondenatured protein molecular weight marker kit producer (sigma; sigma tech. bulletin
n. mkr-137, october 1986: p.1–8). the procedure for determining molecular weights of nondenatured proteins was a
modiﬁcation of the methods of bryan [38] and davis [39].

affinity chromatography

spectroscopic measurements

the desalted solution was added slowly to a slurry of
ni2+-nta material (chelating sepharose fast flow from
amersham biosciences) on ice. the content was slowly
swirled around for 5 min, before carefully removing buffer by vacuum ﬁltration, without letting the ni2+-nta
material run dry. wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate
ph 7.0, 300 mm  xxxd3213xxx , 10% glycerol, 25 mm imidazole) was added, and the mixture was swirled around

all measurements were performed on a varian cary3
uv ⁄ visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature
controlled automatic multi-cell changer. absorption spectra
at various ph values were determined on recombinant
skpyd4p at the protein concentrations 1–1.5 mgæml)1. for
all assays, one unit (u) was deﬁned as the amount of
enzyme which catalyzed the formation of 1 lmol of the corresponding product in 1 min.

affinity chromatography
the desalted solution was applied to a 4.5 ml ni2+-nta
(chelating sepharose fast flow from amersham biosciences). the column was equilibrated and washed with 200 ml
buffer i (50 mm potassium phosphate ph 7.0, 300 mm  xxxd2988xxx , 100 lm plp, 20 mm imidazole). the protein
was eluted by stripping the column with buffer b (50 mm
potassium phosphate ph 7.0, 300 mm  xxxd2988xxx ,
100 lm plp, 10 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).

discontinuous assay using gdh in the presence
of hydrazine (gdh assay)
the enzymatic activity of bal-at type enzymes was determined in a discontinued assay system based on a previously
described method [40]. the ﬁrst reaction is catalyzed by
bal-at type enzymes, which convert bal ⁄ gaba and
akg to msa or ssa and glutamate, respectively (fig. 3).
the second reaction is catalyzed by gdh, which stoichiometrically converts glutamate to akg and ammonia while
reducing nad+ to nadh. for the second reaction to go
to completion, akg originating from the ﬁrst reaction had
to be quenched by hydrazine.
the standard reaction mixture consisted of 100 mm
potassium phosphate (ph 8.0), 100 lm plp, varying concentrations of akg and bal ⁄ gaba, and 0.3–3 lg pyd4
or uga1 enzyme. the reaction was carried out in a total
volume of 200 ll at 30 c for 5 min. the reaction was terminated by addition of 40 ll ice-cold stop mix (20% trichloroacetic acid ⁄ 0.6 m hydrazine) and placed on ice. after
incubation on ice for 10 min, the reaction was neutralized
with 20 ll 2 m potassium hydroxide. the second reaction
mixture contained 260 ll of the ﬁrst reaction, 320 mm glycine buffer (ph 9.0), 5 lm adp, 160 lm nad+ and 0.2 mg
gdh in a ﬁnal volume of 1 ml. a measurement of the initial absorbance at 340 nm was taken before adding nad+.
the reaction was carried out until no further rise in absorbance at 340 nm was observed (1 h). the amount of glutamate was calculated from the total change in absorbance
at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefﬁcient of nadh of

from bal to msadc and  xxxg110xxx 
(msadc assay)
in a continuous assay, the production of msa by bal-at
is coupled with msadc to produce acetaldehyde, which,
in a nadh-dependent  xxxg110xxx  reaction,
generates nad+ and ethanol (fig. 3). the msadc-generated acetaldehyde was monitored by following the depletion
of nadh at 340 nm [21].
amounts of msadc and  xxxg110xxx  used in
the assay system were optimized to concentrations which
are not limiting the ﬁrst reaction. one unit of bal-at was
deﬁned as the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the formation of 1 lmol msa per min. as the bal-at catalyzes
the limiting reaction, the activity can be calculated from the
amount of nadh reduced to nad+ using the extinction
coefﬁcient of nadh of 6.22 mm)1æcm)1. the standard
bal-at assay conditions (1 ml total volume) were 100 mm
potassium phosphate (ph 9.0), 100 lm plp, 0.2 mm
nadh, 5 ll  xxxg110xxx , 50 ll msadc, akg,
bal, 2–30 lg skpyd4p ⁄ skuga1p.

continuous assay coupling the formation
of ssa from gaba to succinic semialdehyde
dehydrogenase ( xxxg138xxx  assay)
in a continuous assay, the ssa produced by uga1p or pyd4p
was converted by the nadp+-dependent  xxxg138xxx , the
e. coli gabd gene product, to nadph and succinate
(fig. 3). the absorbance change at 340 nm was monitored.
the activity of the puriﬁed  xxxg138xxx  was determined at
30 c in a reaction mixture containing 0.3 mm ssa,
0.2 mm nadp+, 100 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.0) in
a ﬁnal volume of 1 ml. the amount of  xxxg138xxx  in the
assay was optimized, so that  xxxg138xxx  was not the ratelimiting step. standard  xxxg8xxx  assay conditions were
100 mm potassium phosphate (ph 8.0), 100 lm plp,
0.3 uæml)1  xxxg138xxx , 0.4 mm nadp+, varying concentrations of akg and gaba, and 0.5–9 lg pyd4 or uga1
enzyme.

data analysis
reciprocal initial velocities (vi) were plotted versus reciprocal substrate concentrations. data for single reciprocal plots
were ﬁtted to (eqn 1):
vi ¼ va=ðka þ aþ

ð1þ

initial velocity pattern in which initial velocity is obtained
as a function of one reactant at different ﬁxed concentrations of the second reactants were ﬁtted to (eqn 2):

vi ¼ vab=ðka b þ kb a þ abþ

ð2þ

for substrate inhibition by akg initial velocity pattern
were ﬁtted to (eqn 3):

vi ¼ vab=ðka b ð1 þ b=kis þ þ kb a þ ðabþ

ð3þ

in (eqns 1–3), vi and v are the initial and maximum velocities, respectively; a and b are the concentrations of reactants; ka and kb are the michaelis constants for the
respective reactants (bal or gaba and akg); and kis is
the inhibition constant for akg.
for kinetics data analysis, the commercial curve-ﬁtting
program enzfitter version 2.0 (biosoft) was employed.
