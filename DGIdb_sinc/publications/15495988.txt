[analogs of glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1): an old concept as a new treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus type 2].  upon ingestion of food, the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) are synthesised and secreted by specialised gut cells. glp-1 is also produced in the pancreatic islets and the central nervous system. both incretins bind to specific g-protein-coupled receptors that are distributed throughout the body. incretins potentiate meal-induced insulin production and secretion by the beta-cells and lower the blood glucose level in the presence of hyperglycaemia. glp-1 and gip stimulate beta-cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas glp-1 only inhibits gastric emptying and glucagon secretion, reduces food intake and improves insulin sensitivity. insulin-resistant and type-2 diabetic patients have an impaired incretin response to meal ingestion. however, the insulinotropic action of exogenous glp-1, but not that of gip, is preserved in these subjects. after parenteral administration, glp-1 has an extremely short duration of action because it is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitous enzyme  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ). to prolong glp-1 bioactivity,  xxxg651xxx -resistant glp-1 analogues,  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors and exenatide, a long-acting synthetic  xxxg899xxx  agonist derived from the gila monster hormone  xxxd2076xxx , have been developed. enhancement of incretin action seems a rational and promising option for the treatment of type-2 diabetes.
