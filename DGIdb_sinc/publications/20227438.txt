recent guidelines in north america and europe recommend lowering low density lipoprotein associated
cholesterol (ldlc) to achieve optimal coronary heart disease risk reduction. statins have been the therapy of
choice and proven successful and relatively safe. however, we are now facing new challenges and it appears
that additional or alternative drugs are urgently needed. this boosts research in the ﬁeld, reopening old cases
like other inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis or making attractive tools from the latest technologies like gene
silencing by anti-sense oligonucleotides.
ldls are cholesterol-enriched lipoproteins stabilized by the hepatic apolipoprotein b100, and derived from
tg rich very low density lipoprotein. this review focuses on the molecular pathways involved in plasma
ldlc production and elimination, in particular cholesterol absorption and the hepatobiliary route, apob100
and vldl production, and ldl clearance via the  xxxg1318xxx . we will identify important or rate-limiting
proteins (including niemann-pick c1-like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ), microsomal tg transfer protein (mtp), acylcoenzyme a/cholesterol acyltransferase (acat), acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferases 2 (dgat2),
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 ( xxxg1684xxx )), and nuclear receptors ( xxxg1597xxx  (fxr),
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  (tr)) that constitute interesting therapeutic targets. numerous compounds
already in use modulate these pathways, such as phytosterols,  xxxd2078xxx , bile acids sequestrants, niacin, and
ﬁbrates.
many pathways can be considered to lower ldlc, but the road has been paved with disappointments and
difﬁculties. with new targets identiﬁed and diversiﬁcation of the drugs, a new era for better ldlc
management is plausible.

1. introduction
1.1. the need for new ldl cholesterol lowering agents
cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in western
countries. there is compelling evidence from population-based data
and clinical trials that low density lipoprotein-associated cholesterol
(ldlc) reduction is an effective strategy to prevent coronary heart
disease (chd), slow its progression or reduce damage (grundy et al.,
2004). statins are powerful ldlc lowering agents that represent the
therapy of choice and continue to give excellent results. the most
recent trials led the experts of the national cholesterol educational
program to consider ldlc values lower than 100 mg/dl to be optimal
for adult patients with chd (expert panel, 2002; grundy et al., 2004).
it was further recommended that ldlc lowering therapies should
target less than 70 mg/dl in the united states and less than 2 mmol/l
(80 mg/dl) in europe in patients with existing coronary heart disease
and additional risk factors (smith et al., 2006; graham et al., 2007a).
unfortunately, recent surveys have shown that patients who are at
the highest cardiovascular risk are also the ones that fail more often to
achieve their therapeutic goal, in particular diabetics (davidson et al.,
2005). some patients also require larger reductions of ldlc due to
their high baseline levels, like those with  xxxg1318xxx . others develop adverse events and stop or discontinue the
therapy (harper & jacobson, 2007; tikkanen et al., 2009). this
illustrates the need for additive or replacement therapy to statins so
going beyond inhibiting the ﬁrst enzymatic reaction of endogenous

cholesterol synthesis. this review will focus on these other molecular
pathways that are currently targeted or may be targeted for lowering
ldlc.
1.2. transport and fate of body cholesterol
cholesterol originating from either de novo synthesis or from the
diet is transported in blood by apolipoproteins (apo) b and  xxxg1335xxx 
containing lipoproteins (fig. 1). the latter are associated with highdensity lipoproteins (hdl). lipid poor hdl are produced by the liver, the
intestine or derived from chylomicrons. they take up free cholesterol
from peripheral organs and macrophages and deliver it to the liver
where it is excreted into the bile, an anti-atherogenic pathway known as
the reverse cholesterol transport (degoma et al., 2008). apob and
 xxxg173xxx -containing lipoprotein pathways are interconnected by a set of
enzyme activities that enable lipid exchange between particles.
cholesterol from nascent hdl is transesteriﬁed with phospholipid acyl
chains by the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase ( xxxg1305xxx ) into
cholesteryl esters. cholesteryl esters can be transferred to apobcontaining lipoproteins very low-density lipoproteins (vldl) or
intermediary low density lipoproteins (idl) in exchange for triglycerides (tgs) by the  xxxg432xxx  (cetp) (masson et
al., 2009). plasma  xxxg1782xxx  ( xxxg1782xxx ) is also associated
with hdl and it transfers phospholipids between lipoproteins,
modulating their size and composition (masson et al., 2009). this
review will focus on apob-containing lipoproteins, represented by tg
rich intestinal chylomicrons, and hepatic vldl or vldl-derived idl and

fig. 1. overview of lipoprotein metabolism in human. in the plasma, cholesterol is transported on lipoproteins of various origins that can be summarized as apolipoprotein (apo) a1(orange pathway) or apob- (blue pathway) containing particles. dietary or biliary cholesterol is absorbed by the small intestine, then carried by chylomicrons rich in triglycerides
(tgs) and stabilised by the apob48. during the postprandial phase, chylomicrons bring  xxxd2154xxx  to extrahepatic organs and their remnants are cleared by the liver. hepatic
cholesterol is secreted in very low-density lipoproteins that are rich in tgs, and stabilized by the apob100. upon hydrolysis of the tgs by lipases (wang et al., 2009), vldl are
transformed into intermediate density lipoproteins (idl) themselves producing low-density lipoproteins (ldl), and enriched with cholesterol transferred from high density
lipoproteins (hdl) by the  xxxg432xxx  (cetp) (masson et al., 2009). once secreted into the plasma, chylomicrons, vldl, idl are bound by apoe, which is
important to their clearance by the  xxxg1318xxx  ( xxxg1318xxx ). ldl can be oxidized and its cholesterol taken up by macrophages, contributing to the atherogenic process. thus, it is
imperative to lower cholesterol associated to ldl and accelerate its removal from the circulation. as illustrated here, the liver is the main gateway for this elimination. lipid poor hdl
are produced by the intestine, liver and chylomicrons, take up free cholesterol from peripheral cells and deliver it to the liver when it can be excreted into the bile. this constitutes the
reverse cholesterol transport pathway (degoma et al., 2008). hdl cholesterol is esteriﬁed by lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase ( xxxg1305xxx ) and their size and composition is modiﬁed
by the  xxxg1782xxx  ( xxxg1782xxx ) (masson et al., 2009).

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

ldl (fig. 1). chylomicrons and vldl bring fuel to peripheral organs as
 xxxd2154xxx  and are progressively depleted of tgs upon the action of
lipases (wang & eckel, 2009). thus chylomicrons are converted into
remnants and vldl into idl and ldl, enriched in cholesterol. ldl is
removed too slowly from the circulation which allows it to exert
proatherogenic properties; in particular it can be oxidized and oxidized
ldl is a source of cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation in
the artery wall.
the  xxxg1318xxx  ( xxxg1318xxx ) is the gateway for hepatic clearance of ldl
and their degradation in lysosomes, and this represents the main
route of cholesterol elimination (goldstein & brown, 2009). ldlderived cholesterol can be temporarily esteriﬁed and stored in the
cytoplasm, eliminated into the bile, or catabolised into bile acids, and
excreted into the intestinal lumen.  xxxg1318xxx  activity is tightly regulated by
cholesterol cell content. indeed, cutting down cholesterol abundance
induces translocation of the transcription factor sterol response
element binding protein-dependent 2 (srebp2) to the nucleus and
activation of the  xxxg1318xxx  ( xxxg1318xxx ) transcription. this accounts for
the ldlc lowering effect of statins through their competitive
inhibition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmgcoa) reductase, a rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis.
bile acids, acting as detergents, facilitate re-absorption of endogenous and dietary cholesterol before they enter the enterohepatic
circulation again. thus, fecal neutral sterol loss corresponds to the
sum of biliary cholesterol and dietary cholesterol minus the amount
absorbed. cholesterol shedding from the intestine from the natural
desquamation process and from the transintestinal cholesterol
excretion (tice) should also be accounted for. although the latter is
of considerable interest, it is not yet clear if it signiﬁcantly modulates
plasma ldlc concentrations, and therefore we will not describe the
research in this ﬁeld but instead refer the reader to the excellent
review by kruit et al. (2006).
2. cholesterol absorption and the enterohepatic biliary route
cholesterol absorption is a complex process, intimately linked to the
quantity and quality of bile acid pool and tightly regulated by molecular
sensors. direct inhibition of cholesterol absorption presents two
advantages as a potential therapy. first, it decreases the contribution

265

of diet or bile to cholesterolemia. second, it results in a statin-like effect,
by decreasing the amount of hepatic cholesterol content and consequently increasing  xxxg1318xxx  expression in the liver. it is believed that statins
decrease cholesterol synthesis and biliary cholesterol excretion, but also
increase fractional cholesterol absorption (vanhanen, 1992). thus
combination therapy between statins and cholesterol absorption
inhibitors should be ideal. modulating bile acid composition or directly
targeting the  xxxg1597xxx   xxxg1597xxx  (fxr) profoundly
affects lipoprotein metabolism and is also an attractive strategy.
2.1. overview of cholesterol absorption and the enterohepatic biliary route
cholesterol absorption varies from 20 to 80% in healthy subjects
(bosner et al., 1999). it is a complex process occurring in the proximal
intestine and involving several transporters and enzymes (mansbach
& gorelick, 2007) (fig. 2). to cross the intestinal barrier and enter the
circulation, cholesterol must be emulsiﬁed by bile acids, hydrolyzed
(if esteriﬁed by a pancreatic esterase), incorporated into micelles,
taken up by enterocytes mainly in the proximal jejunum, re-esteriﬁed
and ﬁnally transferred to lymph. cholesterol cellular concentration in
enterocytes is tightly regulated by a set of proteins. at the brush
border membrane, niemann-pick c1-like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) (davis et al.,
2004) is involved in cholesterol internalization from the lumen
(fig. 2). although other receptors like the class b scavenger receptors
cd36 and  xxxg2013xxx  facilitate cholesterol uptake,  xxxg1583xxx  is a rate limiting
step in cholesterol absorption (nguyen et al., 2009). in mice,  xxxg1583xxx 
deﬁciency results in a decrease in phytosterol and cholesterol
absorption by more than 60%, and resistance to a high cholesterol
diet (altmann et al., 2004; davis et al., 2004). the heterodimer formed
by  xxxg346xxx  and annexin 2 might also play a role in cholesterol
absorption (smart et al., 2004). these ﬁndings were challenged by
results in vivo in mice deﬁcient for  xxxg346xxx  and that present normal
fractional cholesterol absorption and fecal neutral sterol loss (valasek
et al., 2005). it is important to keep in mind that  xxxg346xxx -deﬁcient
mice exhibit higher plasma total cholesterol and increased ldl
cholesterol (valasek et al., 2005). by secreting cholesterol and
phytosterols back into the lumen, the atp binding cassette transporters g5 and g8 (abcg5/g8) divert cholesterol and phytosterols from
the esteriﬁcation pathway which is dependent on acyl- xxxd1739xxx :

fig. 2. cholesterol absorption. in order to cross the intestinal barrier and enter the circulation, dietary or biliary cholesterol is incorporated into micelles and taken up by enterocytes
mainly in the proximal jejunum, re-esteriﬁed and ﬁnally transferred to the lymph. at the apical side of enterocytes, niemann-pick c1-like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) (davis et al., 2004) is involved
in cholesterol internalization from the lumen. cholesterol, and a majority of phytosterols, that have not been esteriﬁed by the acyl- xxxd1739xxx :cholesterol acyl transferase-2
(acat2) are secreted back into the lumen by the two atp binding cassette transporters g5 and g8 (abcg5/g8) (berge et al., 2000; lee et al., 2001; yu et al., 2002a). at the basolateral
side of the cell, another  xxxg22xxx , namely  xxxg9xxx , is important for intestinal hdl production (brunham et al., 2006).

266

cholesterol acyltransferase-2 (acat2). mice or patients deﬁcient in
abcg5/g8 absorb abnormally high levels of phytosterols and show
signs of sitosterolemia and premature atherosclerosis, characterized
by a high plasma concentration of sitosterols (berge et al., 2000; lee
et al., 2001; yu et al., 2002a; altmann et al., 2004). a recent study
showed that the triple knockout abcg5/g8/npcl1l1 protects mice
from sitosterolemia conﬁrming that  xxxg1583xxx  is an important entry
door for phytosterols (tang et al., 2009). acat2 deﬁciency also results
in less cholesterol absorption and resistance to a hypercholesterolemic diet in mice (buhman et al., 2000). it is important to note that at
the basolateral side of the cell, another  xxxg22xxx , namely
 xxxg9xxx , is important for intestinal hdl production (brunham et al.,
2006) (fig. 1). whether or not  xxxg9xxx  plays a signiﬁcant role in
cholesterol absorption is debated (mcneish et al., 2000; drobnik et al.,
2001; calpe-berdiel et al., 2006).
the hepato-biliary system is the major route of body cholesterol
elimination and requires conversion of hydrophobic cholesterol into
hydrophilic bile acids (fig. 3). this relies for 75% on the classic or
neutral pathway, which rate-limiting step corresponds to the initial
step of cholesterol breakdown by cytochrome p450 7a (cyp7a). an
alternative pathway, called ‘acidic’, starts with the production of 27hydroxycholesterol by cytochrome p450 27a1 ( xxxg580xxx ). the initial
metabolites are called primary bile acids, of which the most abundant
forms in human are  xxxd1660xxx   xxxd3479xxx  and  xxxd1685xxx . these bile
acids are converted by intestinal bacteria into secondary bile acids,
respectively lithocholate and  xxxd1835xxx . most of bile acids are reabsorbed by the ileum and enter the enterohepatic cycle. they exert a
negative feedback on their production via bile acid-activated receptor
fxr that decreases cyp7a transcription via the induction of a

repressor, the small heterodimer partner (shp) (lefebvre et al.,
2009). their excretion into the bile duct might result from a balance
between the excretion via abcg5/g8 and their reuptake by  xxxg1583xxx .
indeed the latter is expressed on the hepatocytes canalicular
membrane in humans and monkeys, but not in rodents (altmann et
al., 2004; yu et al., 2006). hepatic overexpression of  xxxg1583xxx  in mice
decreases biliary cholesterol concentration and increases plasma
cholesterol (temel et al., 2007), suggesting that  xxxg1583xxx  mediates
biliary cholesterol re-absorption in hepatocytes. abcg5/g8 and
acat2 are also involved in biliary cholesterol excretion and a section
of this review is dedicated to acat inhibitors (cf. section 3.3.2) (berge
et al., 2000; yu et al., 2002b).
2.2. phytosterols
phytosterols are sterols produced by plants and differ from
cholesterol through the addition of ethyl or methyl groups at c-24
and/or a double bond at c-22. these changes increase their
hydrophobicity and reduce their absorption. the most abundant are
beta-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol (weihrauch & gardner,
1978). stanols, such as campestanol, sitostanol, are saturated sterols.
although they inhibit cholesterol absorption to a similar extent,
sterols and stanols are not equivalent, as stanols are less absorbed, and
10 to 100 less abundant than sterols in the plasma, even when
consumed at a very high dose (gylling et al., 2009). the interest in
these molecules increased with the possibility of introducing them in
food products as esters of long chain  xxxd2154xxx . many studies showed
that both plant sterol and stanol esters lower serum ldlc without
affecting hdlc or tg concentrations (brufau et al., 2008). the average

fig. 3. bile acids and cholesterol metabolism. bile acids and cholesterol metabolism are strongly connected due to positive and negative feedbacks occurring at various levels. hepatic
cholesterol is excreted directly into the bile or converted into primary bile acids. the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid production, cytochrome p450 7a (cyp7a), is indirectly
repressed by  xxxg1597xxx   xxxg1597xxx  (fxr) via two transcription factors small heterodimer partner (shp) and liver receptor homolog (lrh) (lefebvre et al., 2009). in
the ileum, fxr also activates the release of ﬁbroblast growth factor 19 (fgf19) that binds to its hepatic receptor tyrosine-kinase fgf receptor 4 ( xxxg794xxx ), inducing cyp7a repression.
fxr activates or represses many other genes involved in lipoprotein production and clearance as well as glucose homeostasis (lefebvre et al., 2009). intestinal ﬂora convert primary
bile acids into secondary bile acids and 95% of the pool is re-absorbed. bile acids also modulate postprandial glycemia by activating  xxxg89xxx  tgr5 in l-cells.
activated tgr5 modulates the secretion of incretin  xxxg873xxx  ( xxxg873xxx ) that stimulates insulin secretion, represses glucagon release, gastric emptying and food intake
(maruyama et al., 2002; katsuma et al., 2005). this might account for the anti-diabetic effect of bile acid sequestrants. acting as detergents, bile acids are also necessary to the
formation of micelles and proper absorption of cholesterol.

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

daily intake of phytosterols is 200–350 mg in a western diet
(klingberg et al., 2008; hearty et al., 2008). as  xxxg1583xxx  is a much
weaker transporter for phytosterols than cholesterol (ge et al., 2008),
35 to 70% of intestinal cholesterol is absorbed, compared to less than
5% for phytosterols and less than 0.5% for phytostanols (ostlund et al.,
2002). furthermore, phytosterols are poor candidates for esteriﬁcation by acat2 (temel et al., 2003) and therefore are massively
excreted back into the lumen by abcg5/g8. consequently, total
plasma phytosterol concentration is less than 1 mg/dl in healthy
subjects (von bergmann et al., 2005).
the explanatory mechanisms behind the ldlc lowering properties
of phytosterols are still unclear. one of them is competition between
phytosterols/phytostanols and cholesterol for incorporation into
micelles (ikeda et al., 1989). however, a number of experiments
suggest alternative causes. as an example, multiple daily intakes of
phytosterols at meal times are not more efﬁcacious at lowering ldlc
than single daily doses, showing that phytosterols do not need to be
present at the same time as cholesterol to inhibit its absorption (plat
et al., 2000). it has also been shown in vitro that phytosterols have the
capacity to activate the nuclear receptor liver x receptor (lxr)
(kaneko et al., 2003; plat et al., 2005), suggesting that they might act
on cholesterol activation by modulating the expression of key
transporters. it is known that lxr activation upregulates abcg5/g8
(repa et al., 2002). however, the hypothesis that lxr activation
mediates the effect of phytosterols seems irrelevant in vivo because 1)
a diet enriched with phytosterols or stanol esters does not affect
abcg5/g8 or  xxxg1583xxx  intestinal expression (field et al., 2004; plosch
et al., 2006; calpe-berdiel et al., 2007) 2) although lxr activation
reduces cholesterol absorption in an abcg5/g8-dependent fashion
(yu et al., 2003), phytosterol-mediated reduction in cholesterol
absorption is not dependent on abcg5/g8 (yu et al., 2003; plosch et
al., 2004). in vivo experiments showed that it is unlikely that  xxxg9xxx 
contributes signiﬁcantly to the cholesterol reducing effect of phytosterols (calpe-berdiel et al., 2006). submitting lxralpha and lxrbeta double
knockout mice to a high phytosterol diet might conﬁrm or not a role
for this nuclear receptor in the cholesterol reducing effect of
phytosterols.
although the debate of how phytosterols decrease cholesterolemia
is unsettled, there is a consensus on their efﬁcacy. at a dose of 1.8 g/d,
margarine spreads of sterol and stanol esters reduce both dietary and
biliary cholesterol absorption by ∼25–35% in hypercholesterolemic
subjects (jones et al., 2000). the national cholesterol educational
program for cholesterol management in adults (nectp atp iii)
recommends including 2 g/d of phytosterols to the diet of subjects
with elevated ldlc (expert panel, 2002). a meta-analysis was
recently performed to establish a continuous dose-response relationship for predicting the ldlc lowering efﬁcacy of various phytosterol
doses (demonty et al., 2009). the equation took into account the
saturable nature of cholesterol absorption. the equation predicted an
ldlc lowering effect of −9% for a daily dose of 2 g/d, which ﬁts with
the observation of a pooled ldlc reduction of 0.34 mmol/l or 8.8% for
a mean daily dose of 2.15 g phytosterols. there were no signiﬁcant
differences between dose response curves established for sterols vs
stanols, fat-based vs non fat-based food and dairy vs non-dairy
products. the larger effects were observed in populations with the
highest ldlc concentrations, which probably also explains that
phytosterols are more efﬁcacious in older subjects that present higher
ldlc concentrations. the ldlc-lowering effect of phytosterols
reached a plateau at intakes of ∼3 g/d with a reduction of 10.7%
(demonty et al., 2009). these ﬁndings conﬁrmed a previous analysis
that showed the relative small beneﬁt provided by doses above 2.5 g/d
(katan et al., 2003).
sterols or stanols decrease ldlc efﬁciently in hypercholesterolemic patients as a monotherapy to the same extent as they do when
added to a statin (neil et al., 2001; o'neill et al., 2005). the additive
effect has been demonstrated in several studies, and is slightly

267

superior (−7 to −15%) to what is expected by doubling the dose of
the statin (blair et al., 2000; neil et al., 2001; o'neill et al., 2005). it is
also sustainable in time (miettinen et al., 1995; de jong et al., 2008).
phytosterols could be combined to other drugs than statins. a triple
therapy with statin,  xxxd1684xxx  and phytostanols massively
reduced ldlc (−67%) in hypercholesterolemic subjects (gylling &
miettinen, 2002).
unfortunately, there is no clinical trial that proved a beneﬁcial
effect of phytosterols on coronary heart disease and no long-term
study concerning their safety. there is also a crucial lack of long-term
comparative studies comparing the efﬁcacy and safety of phytostanols
vs phytosterols with a signiﬁcant number of subjects.
2.3.  xxxg1583xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2078xxx 
initial screening of 2-azetidinones as acat inhibitors revealed that
although in vivo these compounds did not inhibit cholesterol
esteriﬁcation, they were efﬁcient cholesterol absorption inhibitors.
these ﬁndings led to the identiﬁcation of  xxxd2078xxx  as a powerful drug
to inhibit dietary and bile cholesterol uptake by the intestine. the
compound is extensively conjugated to glucuronide in the intestine,
and excreted mainly in the stool (clader et al., 1996; van heek et al.,
1997). the bile glucuronide metabolite is more efﬁcient than the
parent molecule (van heek et al., 1997). it took several more years to
identify the molecular target of  xxxd2078xxx . using a genomic/bioinformatic approach, altman et al. screened cdna libraries from rat
jejunum mucosal scrapings and enterocytes for a candidate gene
combining features predictive of a cholesterol transporter, i.e.
transmembrane domains, extracellular signal peptides, n-linked
glycosilation sites and cholesterol interacting domains;  xxxg1583xxx 
came up as the only candidate (altmann et al., 2004). the target
was validated in vivo when mice deﬁcient for  xxxg1583xxx  were found to
absorb 69% less cholesterol than wild type controls (altmann et al.,
2004).  xxxd2078xxx  also reduced cholesterol absorption by ∼70% in wild
type mice, and did not result in further reduction in  xxxg1583xxx −/−
mice, showing that  xxxg1583xxx  is critical to cholesterol absorption.
 xxxd2078xxx  binds to a 61 amino acid region of the extracellular domain
of  xxxg1583xxx  (weinglass et al., 2008), a protein recycled between the
plasma membrane and the endocytic recycling compartments that
also mediates cholesterol uptake through vesicular endocytosis (ge
et al., 2008). when cells are depleted of cholesterol,  xxxg1583xxx  is
directed toward the plasma membrane. however, cholesterol replenishment induces its translocation toward the endosomes. microﬁlament and clathrin/ap2 are required for this trafﬁcking.  xxxd2078xxx 
blocks cholesterol uptake by disrupting this internalisation (ge et al.,
2008). in fact,  xxxd2078xxx  disrupts the complex formed by  xxxg346xxx 
and annexin 2 in mouse enterocytes from hypercholesterolemic
 xxxg1318xxx −/− mice, or wild type mice, fed a high fat diet but not a
standard diet (smart et al., 2004). moreover,  xxxd2078xxx  was equally
effective in lowering cholesterol absorption in  xxxg346xxx -deﬁcient
mice (valasek et al., 2005), suggesting that this pathway does not
signiﬁcantly contribute to its effect. it was suggested that hepatic
 xxxg1583xxx  promotes the reuptake of cholesterol from bile (temel et al.,
2007). accordingly,  xxxd2078xxx  treatment of patients with gallstones
was accompanied with a reduction of biliary cholesterol (wang
et al., 2008).
in monkeys,  xxxd2078xxx  reduces postprandial phase chylomicron
cholesterol content without affecting particle number or tg content
(van heek et al., 2001). however, in humans, tremblay et al. reported
a decrease in the pool size of apob48 tg rich lipoproteins with a trend
toward a reduction of their production rate (tremblay et al., 2009).
the reduction in cholesterol delivery to the liver is probably
associated with a compensatory increase in the cholesterol synthesis
enzyme hmgcoa reductase mrna (altmann et al., 2004) and in the
 xxxg1318xxx  activity. consequently,  xxxd2078xxx  increases vldl and ldl
apob100 fcr (tremblay et al., 2009).

268

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

in hypercholesterolemic patients,  xxxd2078xxx  decreases ldlc by
∼15% and modestly increases hdlc (dujovne et al., 2002). recently,
the 24-month imaging study  xxxd2078xxx  and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia enhances atherosclerosis regression enhance compared the effect of 80 mg of simvastatin plus placebo or 80 mg
simvastatin and 10 mg of  xxxd2078xxx  in patients with heterozygous
 xxxg1318xxx  (kastelein et al., 2008). there was no
beneﬁt of the combined therapy on the primary outcome, change of
intima-media thickness in carotid arteries. this was disappointing
since at the end of the study, treatment differences indicated a 16%
additional decrease for ldlc, 6.6% for tgs and 26% for c-reactive
protein in the group with combined therapy. the authors suggested
that the thickness of the intima media in these patients that had
already beneﬁted from intensive drug therapy might have been two
small from the very beginning of the trial to reveal any additional
effect of  xxxd2078xxx . thus larger trials on other patient populations
might bring different conclusions. however,  xxxd2078xxx  has been hurt
again by results from the recent trial arterial biology for the
investigation of the treatment effects of reducing cholesterol 6hdl and ldl treatment strategies (arbiter 6-halts). this trial
compared the effect of  xxxd2078xxx  or extended-release niacin as addon therapy in patients who had coronary heart disease or coronary
heart disease risk equivalent and who were receiving statin therapy
(taylor et al., 2009). patients had an ldlc under 100 mg/dl and hdl
under 50 mg/dl for men and under 55 md/dl for women. after
14 months, niacin signiﬁcantly increased hdlc by 18.4%, reduced
ldlc and tgs.  xxxd2078xxx  decreased ldlc by 19.2% and reduced hdlc
and tgs. niacin reduced mean carotid intima-media thickness while
 xxxd2078xxx  increased it.
in humans, the concept of poor or good responders to statin and
 xxxd2078xxx  treatments illustrates the connection between intestinal
absorption and endogenous synthesis (miettinen et al., 2000; pisciotta
et al., 2007). plasma lathosterol and desmosterol are markers of
cholesterol synthesis while campesterol, sitosterol and cholestanol
are markers of fractional cholesterol absorption (miettinen et al.,
1990). it was reported that plasma sterols serve as markers of ldlc
lowering response to statins (miettinen et al., 2000). there has been
some interest in using baseline cholesterol absorption markers to
individualize treatments. indeed good responders to statins are
supposedly low cholesterol absorbers (miettinen et al., 2000) because
statins suppress cholesterol synthesis, while good responders to
 xxxd2078xxx  are expected to be high absorbers. however, a posthoc
analysis of the enhance study showed that baseline cholesterol
absorption markers were not predictive of the effect of the association
 xxxd2078xxx /statin in term of ldlc lowering in patients with familial
hypercholesterolemia, even though cholesterol absorption inhibition
was more pronounced in high cholesterol absorbers (jakulj et al.,
2009).
in conclusion,  xxxd2078xxx  efﬁciently blocks cholesterol entrance in
the intestine by targeting  xxxg1583xxx  and reduces ldlc. however, the
ultimate beneﬁt of this strategy is not yet supported by large clinical
trials. recent data suggest that the combination niacin/statin that
raises hdlc is more beneﬁcial than  xxxd2078xxx /statin. altogether this
could illustrate that the beneﬁcial effects of statins are also due to
their pleiotropic effects beyond ldlc lowering, or that lowering as
much ldlc as possible in adult patients cannot be as beneﬁcial as a
lifelong reduction. these results also conﬁrm the beneﬁt of drug
combination targeting multiple pathways (ldlc and hdlc in the case
of statin/niacin). overall, the example of  xxxd2078xxx  illustrates the
complexity of developing trials for lowering ldlc.
2.4. bile acid sequestrants
bile acid sequestrants opened the path for research and development of hypolipidemic drugs as very early work showed that they
modiﬁed cholesterolemia. modifying the quality and quantity of the

bile acids pool has profound implications (fig. 3). as detergents, bile
acids are essential to micelle formation and therefore dependent
cholesterol and vitamin absorption. as signalling molecules, they
activate the g-protein-coupled receptor tgr5 and nuclear receptors
fxr, androstane receptor,  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) and the vitamin
d receptor. sequestrants are positively charged molecules that trap
bile acids and promote their excretion in faeces.  xxxd1684xxx , a
resin of the ﬁrst generation, reduced the risk of coronary heart disease
and decreased mean total cholesterol by 8% and ldlc by 12% in the
lipid research clinics coronary primary prevention trial (rifkind,
1984) but this sequestrant suffered from undesirable gastrointestinal
effects. the second generation of bile acid sequestrant, for example
colesevelam hydrochloride, is more speciﬁc, binds bile acids with
greater afﬁnity and is better tolerated. as a monotherapy for 6 weeks,
at a daily dose of ∼3.8 g, colesevelam reduced ldlc by ∼12–16% in
moderately hypercholesterolemic patients (knapp et al., 2001;
hunninghake et al., 2001). in the same studies, an additive effect
was observed in combination therapy with atorvastatin (hunninghake et al., 2001) and simvastatin (knapp et al., 2001). a pooled
analysis of three 6-week clinical trials compared the effect of
colesevelam hydrochloride with placebo as add-on therapy to stable
simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin treaments in patients with
primary hypercholesterolemia (bays et al., 2006). the primary endpoint was mean percent change in ldlc. colesevelam hydrochloride
signiﬁcantly reduced ldlc by 16% compared with baseline and 9%
compared with placebo. the number of patients reaching ldlc levels
b100 mg/dl was increased by four times with the add-on therapy. the
secondary end points included the marker of inﬂammation, highsensitivity  xxxg520xxx  (hs-crp) levels. hs-crp was signiﬁcantly more reduced with the add-on therapy than with statins alone. this
illustrates how bile acid sequestrant might provide beneﬁcial effects
as add-on therapies to statins beyond ldlc reduction. a particular
attention has been drawn toward the hypoglycaemic effects of
colesevelam. early trials comparing  xxxd1684xxx  and placebo in
dyslipidemic and diabetic type 2 patients who where well controlled
identiﬁed a decrease of fasting glycemia and glucosuria (garg &
grundy, 1994). the pilot study glucose-lowering effect of welchol
(glows) evaluated the effect of colesevelam hydrochloride on
glycemic control in inadequately controlled subjects with type 2
diabetes (7% b glycosylated haemoglobin (hba1c)b10%) over
12 weeks (zieve et al., 2007). compared with matching placebo,
colesevelam treatment signiﬁcantly decreased hba1c, and the effect
was more pronounced in patients with baseline values above 8%.
(−1% difference in the least squares mean change). in the colesevelam group this was associated with a reduction in levels of
fructosamin and posprandial glucose, and a mean percent change of
−9.6% for ldlc. in 2008, the food and drug administration approved
colesevelam hydrochloride for the treatment of adult patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin
and/or insulin therapy.
the ldlc lowering effect of bile acid resins is believed to be
mediated via the interruption of the negative feedback they exert on
their own synthesis, via fxr mediated cyp7a repression (fig. 3). it is
also known that ileal fxr activation releases ﬁbroblast growth factor
19 (fgf19) or its murine hortologue fgf15 from hepatocytes and ileal
cells (holt et al., 2003; inagaki et al., 2005). in turn fgf19 binds to its
cell-surface receptor tyrosine-kinase fgf receptor 4 and strongly
represses expression of cyp7a1 through a c- xxxg1370xxx 
(jnk)-dependent pathway (holt et al., 2003). thus, upon resin
treatment, more cholesterol is converted into bile acids, as illustrated
by the increase in plasma marker of cholesterol synthesis lathosterol
in patients (elmberger et al., 1991). ultimately, cholesterol depletion
probably results into a statin-like effect and increases  xxxg1318xxx  expression.
the reason for the hba1c decrease induced by bile acid
sequestrants is unclear. an initial explanation could be decreased
glucose and carbohydrate absorption. it is also possible that resins acts

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

upon posprandial glycemia through modulation of the intestinal gprotein coupled receptor tgr5 (m-bar, gp-bar1 or bg37). tgr5 is
activated by primary and secondary bile acids, in particular lithocolate
(maruyama et al., 2002) and activates the secretion of incretin
 xxxg873xxx  ( xxxg873xxx ) by intestinal l cells (maruyama et al.,
2002; katsuma et al., 2005).  xxxg873xxx  release leads to increased insulin
secretion, delayed glucagon secretion and decreased gastric emptying.
a comparative before/after treatment study determined that a one
week treatment of hypercholesterolemic type 2 diabetic patients with
bile acid sequestrant colestimide decreased signiﬁcantly 2-h postprandial plasma glucose and increased glp-1 (suzuki et al., 2007).
determination of  xxxg873xxx  concentrations in larger clinical trials will be
very informative. at the least, the hypoglycaemic effect of resins
might be mediated by the fxr pathway. indeed fxr modulates
glycogen storage, gluconeogenesis and insulin sensitivity, although its
precise role remains controversial (lefebvre et al., 2009).
one disadvantage of bile acid sequestrants is that they increase
mean plasma tgs, and the ncep guidelines states that bile acid
sequestrants should not be used in patients with tg n 400 mg/dl and
should be used as monotherapy only in persons with tg b200 mg/dl
(expert panel, 2002) . why and how bile acid resins increase plasma
tgs in human is unclear, despite numerous studies in vitro and in
other species. theoretically, fxr silencing should increase vldl
production, reduce their catabolism due to decreased lipoprotein
lipase activity and decreased vldlr expression (bilz et al., 2006;
lefebvre et al., 2009).
as second generations of bile acid sequestrants are very promising
drugs, it appears that their effect does not solely rely on fxrdependent pathways. thus, it is unlikely that fxr antagonists would
present with similar properties. on this matter, the efﬁcacy of the
natural fxr antagonist guggulsterone to effectively lower ldlc in
humans at common doses remains unclear (ulbricht et al., 2005).
3. vldl production inhibitors
shutting down vldl production leads de facto to lower plasma
ldlc concentrations. vldl apob synthesis and assembly is a multistep process involving several enzymes and substrates. thus the
complexity and ﬁne-tuning of this metabolic pathway presented
many difﬁculties, in particular because decreasing vldl output was
often accompanied by hepatic steatosis. new technology (antisense
oligonucleotides targeting apob) or more speciﬁc targets (acat2,
intestinal mtp) might be the solution.

269

rough endoplasmic reticulum (er) (fisher & ginsberg, 2002). this
prevents protein mis-folding and degradation. the second step
consists of the fusion of the lipidated apob to a large, apob-free tg
particle (fisher and ginsberg, 2002). by the end of this maturation
process, the lipoprotein has reached the golgi and is soon to be
secreted (fisher and ginsberg, 2002). but the nascent vldl is not yet
safe as its secretion is modulated by either the  xxxg1318xxx  in a post er
compartment via the apob and the constitutive endocytic pathway, or
via the apoe and an unidentiﬁed non canonical-endocytic mechanism
(jones et al., 2007; michaely et al., 2007; blasiole et al., 2008).
there are two main strategies for inhibiting apob output (fig. 4):
decreasing apob production by targeting its mrna, or suppressing its
maturation by inhibiting the lipidation process. the latter can be
achieved by decreasing the amount of substrate available (cholesteryl
ester, tgs), or by targeting the rate-limiting step enzyme mtp.
3.2. antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering rna targeting apob
antisense oligonucleotides (aso) and interfering rna (rnai) are
promising tools for inhibiting apob production. aso are single strand
oligonucleotides that anneal to their target mrna (fattal & bochot,
2008). rnai are duplexes of rna containing a sequence identical to
that of the target mrna (fattal and bochot, 2008). aso and rnai
ultimately induce their target's mrna destruction and suppress
protein production (fattal and bochot, 2008).
in 2006, a phase i clinical trial was performed with isis 301012
(mipomersen), a 20-mer oligonucleotide that hybridizes to apob
mrna (kastelein et al., 2006). a dose dependent effect on circulating
apob and ldlc was observed. subjects receiving mipomersen at the
200-mg dose showed a maximum 50% reduction in apob and 35%
reduction in ldlc from baseline. the decrease remained signiﬁcant up
to 3 months after the last administration and there was no evidence of
steatosis, although hepatic tg has not been determined. of note, no
pharmacokinetic interaction between mipomersen and simvastatin or
 xxxd2078xxx  was detected (yu et al., 2009). the drug is currently in
phase iii clinical development.
rnai are more recent, but they have been proven to be efﬁcient at
lowering apob synthesis and ldlc in mice (soutschek et al., 2004) and
cynomolgus monkeys (zimmermann et al., 2006). thus, the targeting
of apob using aso and rnai is a non-classical approach that
effectively illustrates how new technology suddenly opens up new
therapeutic possibilities.
3.3. apob lipidation and vldl assembly inhibitors

3.1. overview of synthesis and degradation of nascent vldl
 xxxg175xxx  is the structural lipoprotein of vldl, idl, ldl, lp
(a) and chylomicrons (fig. 1). the editing of the single apob mrna by
the apob mrna editing enzyme catalytic complex 1 (apobec-1)
(navaratnam et al., 1993) produces two proteins i.e. apob100 and
apob48 (powell et al., 1987). apob48 corresponds to 48% of apob100
n-terminal extremity. in adult humans, apob100 is speciﬁc to hepatic
vldl, idl and ldl and apob48 to the intestine and chylomicrons due
to the tissue speciﬁc expression of apobec-1. in rodents, the liver or
the intestine secretes both forms. together with apoe, apob100 is a
ligand for the  xxxg1318xxx  (jeon & blacklow, 2005). but, apob48 is not a ligand
for the  xxxg1318xxx  because it lacks the apob100 c-terminal domain.
consequently the liver, via apoe, clears chylomicron remnants.
apob is constitutively synthesized and its secretion is modulated
by the extent of its degradation (borchardt & davis, 1987) (fig. 4).
efﬁcient tg synthesis and lipidation of nascent apob and vldl by the
acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase (acat) and the microsomal tg
transfer protein (mtp) is essential to this process. there is a consensus
on a 2-step model in the apob-containing lipoprotein assembly. as
reviewed by fisher et al., small amounts of lipids are ﬁrst added to the
apob upon its being translated and translocated into the lumen of the

3.3.1. dgat2 inhibitors
early studies in cells showed that decreasing the availability of tgs
promotes apob degradation (reviewed in (fisher and ginsberg,
2002)). acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferases-2 (dagt2) is an
enzyme essential to the ﬁnal step of tg synthesis in the liver. in mice,
knockdown of dagt2 using aso resulted in a steep decrease of vldl
production due to a lack of hepatic tg synthesis and consequently
apob production (yu et al., 2005; liu et al., 2008).
3.3.2. acat inhibitors
acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferases acat1 and acat2 are in
charge of cellular cholesterol esteriﬁcation. acat1 is typically
expressed in macrophages and atherosclerotic lesions making it
reasonable to think that inhibiting acat1 would prevent macrophage
foam cell accumulation and diminish atherosclerosis. however, acat1
deletion in apoe−/− xxxg1318xxx −/− mice led to massive free cholesterol
accumulation in the skin and brain (accad et al., 2000). based on
intravascular coronary ultrasound data (nissen et al., 2006; tardif et
al., 2004), the non-selective acat inhibitors pactimibe and avasimibe
were found to be more proatherogenic than protective in patients
with coronary artery disease. a parallel study in hypercholesterolemic

fig. 4.  xxxg1318xxx  and apob synthesis. plasma ldlc is the result of a balance between vldl synthesis and ldl catabolism and consequently is highly dependent on the number of  xxxg1318xxx 
present at the surface of the hepatocyte (1) and the efﬁciency of apob lipidation and secretion (2). hepatic  xxxg1318xxx  is the major route for elimination of body cholesterol. its transcription
rate is highly regulated by ldl-derived cholesterol via the sterol response element binding protein 2 (srebp2), a transcription factor that activates  xxxg1318xxx  transcription (goldstein and
brown, 2009). by decreasing cellular cholesterol content, phytosterols,  xxxd2078xxx , statins and squalene synthase inhibitors promote translocation of the mature form of srebp2 to the
nucleus and  xxxg1318xxx  transcription. bile acid sequestrants impair micellisation of cholesterol and therefore reduce its absorption, but they also might act as  xxxg1597xxx 
antagonists by sequestering its natural ligands. thyromimetics induce  xxxg1318xxx  expression probably via direct promoter activation (bakker et al., 1998; lopez et al., 2007). glycosylated
 xxxg1318xxx  reach the cell surface and accumulate at clathrin coated pits. ldl endocytosis leads to their degradation in lysosomes while the receptor is recycled (jeon and blacklow, 2005).
future proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors are expected to lower ldlc because this protein binds to the  xxxg1318xxx  and impairs its recycling (costet et al., 2008).
(2) vldl synthesis is a complex process that is highly regulated by degradation of the apob100. it is now possible to directly target apob mrna with antisense oligonucleotides (aso)
or interfering rna (rnai). inhibitors of acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (dagt2), microsomal transfer protein (mtp) and  xxxg430xxx -2
(acat2) prevent the proper lipidation of apob100 or the nascent vldl and promote their degradation. niacin was also believed to reduce hepatic fatty acid availability for apob
lipidation, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. fxr ligands act on vldl conversion into idl. altogether, these ﬁndings illustrate the wide array of possibilities offered to lower
ldlc.

patients veriﬁed the efﬁcacy and safety of pactimibe in reducing the
progression of atherosclerosis, evaluated by measuring carotid intima
thickness (meuwese et al., 2009). due to the negative results of the
intravascular coronary evaluation, the trial was prematurely terminated leaving obviously disappointing results: pactimibe treatment
was associated with an increase of intima media thickness and
increased incidences of cardiovascular events (meuwese et al., 2009).
selective inhibition of acat2 might not lead to the same
detrimental effects. indeed, acat2 expression is restricted to
hepatocytes and the enterocyte, two tissues free of acat1 (lee
et al., 2000; parini et al., 2004). acat2 – and not acat1 – provides
cholesterol esters, mainly cholesteryl  xxxd2777xxx  and cholesteryl palmitate
to chylomicrons, vldl and cytosolic fat droplets, maybe as a defense
mechanism of the cell against free cholesterol accumulation (lee
et al., 2005). liver speciﬁc knockdown of acat2 using aso led to a
decrease in plasma cholesterol, and an increase in plasma tg. the liver
acat2 knockdown changed the composition of ldl cholesteryl esters
towards particles enriched with polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (bell
et al., 2006). ultimately, this proﬁle showed some antiatherogenic
properties in the apob100-only  xxxg1318xxx −/− mice (bell et al., 2006).
interestingly, liver speciﬁc depletion of acat2 elegantly illustrated
the functionality of direct trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion,

leading to non-biliary fecal cholesterol loss (brown et al., 2008). the
relevance of acat2-dependent cholesteryl ester incorporation to
vldl in human was recently conﬁrmed in patients with maturityonset diabetes of the young (mody) 1 (pramfalk et al., 2009).  xxxg1065xxx 
is a disease of autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset diabetes,
and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and is caused by mutation of the
hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha ( xxxg1065xxx ). the authors observed that
 xxxg1065xxx  patients had lower levels of vldl and ldl esteriﬁed
cholesterol as well as tgs. they identiﬁed that  xxxg1065xxx  is a strong
activator of acat2 in the liver and that mody mutations impaired this
activity. speciﬁc acat2 inhibitors like derivatives of fungal pyripyropene a are now under scrutiny (das et al., 2008).
3.3.3. mtp inhibitors
 xxxg1481xxx  (mtp) transfers neutral
lipids (tgs, phospholipids, cholesterol esters) to nascent apob as a
rate-limiting step in vldl and chylomicron synthesis. it is a
heterodimer composed of the 55 kda ubiquitous multifunctional
disulﬁde isomerase and a 97 kda subunit that confers its activity to
the complex (wetterau & zilversmit, 1986; wetterau et al., 1990;
wetterau et al., 1992). mtp, coded by the  xxxg1481xxx  gene, is located in the
lumen of hepatocytes and enterocytes er (wetterau and zilversmit,

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

1986). examination of livers from  xxxg1481xxx  deﬁcient mice by electron
microscopy showed no accumulation of neutral lipids in the er,
contrary to what is observed in wild type mice (raabe et al., 1999).
this suggested that mtp is also involved in the second step of vldl
assembly, the transfer of the bulk of tgs into the lumen of the er
where they form vldl-sized lipid particles.
in humans, mutations in the large subunit of the mtp result in
abetalipoproteinemia, an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized
by a lack of chylomicron and vldl synthesis but also fat malabsorption,  xxxd3521xxx  deﬁciency (it is carried by apob-containing lipoproteins), steatorrhea and hepatic steatosis (shoulders et al., 1993;
wetterau and zilversmit, 1986). systemic mtp inhibition targets both
intestine and liver, efﬁciently reducing ldlc up to 50% due to a
dramatic decrease in apob production (cuchel et al., 2007; samaha
et al., 2008). however, reports from various clinical trials were
disappointing due to unacceptable gastrointestinal and hepatic side
effects (hepatic transaminases elevations, hepatic steatosis, diarrhea)
(cuchel et al., 2007; samaha et al., 2008; joy & hegele, 2008). this was
accompanied with a decrease in apoai and hdlc for reasons that
remain unclear. hdlc decrease was also observed in  xxxg1481xxx  knockout
mice (raabe et al., 1999).
restricting mtp inhibition to the intestine using non-systemic
inhibitors should spare the liver from some side effects, still reducing
postprandial tgs and cholesterol. such an inhibitor is currently in
phase 2 clinical development.
3.4. niacin: does it act on vldl production?
 xxxd2715xxx , or niacin, signiﬁcantly lowers the risk of coronary
heart disease (canner et al., 1986). niacin is particularly adapted to
patients with mixed dylipidemia, characterized by hypertriglyceriemia, low hdl and/or elevated lp(a). niacin modiﬁes lipoproteins
toward a less atherogenic proﬁle, decreasing tgs and lp(a), increasing
hdlc, and to a lesser extent, decreasing ldlc by ∼20% (goldberg et al.,
2000). its role on hdlc is certainly prominent over ldlc. in particular,
niacin decreases the proatherogenic small dense ldl fraction
(superko et al., 2004). it is usually believed that niacin-mediated
reduction in ldlc is the consequence of decreased hepatic vldl
production. in vitro, niacin increases apob post-translational degradation by inhibiting both fatty acid synthesis and esteriﬁcation,
without affecting apob mrna levels or the  xxxg1318xxx  activity (jin et al.,
1999). later work showed that niacin inhibits diacylglycerol:acyltransferase-2 (dgat2), an enzyme involved in tg synthesis (ganji
et al., 2004). early ﬁndings in adipose tissue showed that niacin has an
immediate inhibitory effect on lipolysis and free fatty acid release
(carlson, 2005), suggesting that this is the cause of reduced vldl
synthesis and lower ldlc. fasting free  xxxd2154xxx  are decreased in
mice deﬁcient for the adipose,  xxxg1026xxx , g proteincoupled receptor 109a ( xxxg1026xxx , puma-g,  xxxg1027xxx ), and are not
further reduced by  xxxd2715xxx  injection compared with wild type
mice (tunaru et al., 2003). when placed on a high fat high-sucrose
diet and a 2-week treatment by  xxxd2715xxx ,  xxxg1026xxx -deﬁcient
mice were unresponsive to the hypotriglyceridemic effect of nicotinic
acid (tunaru et al., 2003).
the hypothesis of a long-term suppressive effect of niacin on vldl
production due to a decrease in substrate availability (free  xxxd2154xxx )
is challenged by several ﬁndings that were made in humans from
kinetic studies. kinetic studies performed in normolipidemic fasting
women infused with [2-13c1]glycerol and [1,2,3,4-13c4]palmitate
revealed that chronic administration of  xxxd2715xxx  slowed down
vldl synthesis. however, this trait could not be related to lipolysis,
reﬂected by plasma free fatty acid concentrations (wang et al., 2001).
in the same patients, acute administration of niacin resulted in a
decrease of ffa concentrations, quickly followed by a rebound, as
previously described (wang et al., 2001; carlson, 2005). kinetic
analysis in hyperlipidemic patients using [3h] glycerol as a precursor

271

of tg showed that  xxxd2715xxx  reduced vldl-tg transport by 21% in
relation to a decrease in particle size, but not in particle number.
unfortunately, the fractional catabolic rate (fcr) of ldl was not
determined in this study. more recently, lipoprotein kinetics using
deuterated leucine with an extended-release form of niacin showed
that the reduction in plasma apob100-tg rich lipoprotein could be
related to a trend toward an increased fcr, but not by a change in
production rate. similarly, a signiﬁcant increase in apob48-tg rich
lipoprotein fcr was observed with no change of production rate
(lamon-fava et al., 2008). thus, the hypothesis of an effect of niacin
on hepatic vldl production per se is challenged by kinetic studies in
humans.
whether the increase of hdlc is linked to the decrease in vldl
upon niacin treatment is unclear. it was proposed that niacin
increases apoai synthesis retarding its hepatic catabolism, but there
are conﬂicting results concerning its suppressive effect on cholesterol
ester transfer protein activity that moves cholesterol esters in
exchange for tgs from vldl-ldl to hdl. with less tg available due
to a reduction of the vldl pool, cetp activity might be slowed down
and hdl may accumulate. for a review of these pathways, we suggest
the excellent review by watts et al. (watts & chan, 2008). of note, in
species in which cetp is absent, niacin was still able to reduce ldlc
(van der hoorn et al., 2008).
niacin has been successfully used in combination with statins. the
recent trial arbiter 6-halts showed that it is superior to the
association  xxxd2078xxx /statin, leading to regression of carotid intimamedia thickness (taylor et al., 2009). on top of increasing hdlc by
18.4% at the end of the 14-month trial niacin lowered ldlc and tg in
this population of patients with a history of coronary heart disease or
the risk equivalent and who presented with ldlc under 100 mg/dl
and hdl under 50 mg/dl for men and 55 mg/dl for women (taylor
et al., 2009).
3.5. fxr ligands
fxr is involved in many metabolic pathways and its activation is
predicted to have conﬂicting effects on ldlc. whether one of these
pathways would ultimately be dominant in human is still to be
determined. fxr agonists decrease vldl production by increasing
vldl lipolysis through the positive regulation of  xxxg1337xxx 
coactivator apoc-ii expression (kast et al., 2001) and the repression of
the inhibitory apoc-iii (claudel et al., 2003). fxr also upregulates the
expression of vldl receptors, vldlr, and  xxxg2036xxx -1 (anisfeld et al.,
2003; sirvent et al., 2004). at the same time, fxr activation represses
cyp7a (lefebvre et al., 2009), leading to hepatic cholesterol
accumulation and silencing of the srebp2 pathway. statin-resistant
hypercholesterolemia observed in humans deﬁcient in cyp7a is an
extreme illustration of cyp7a silencing (pullinger et al., 2002). thus it
is difﬁcult to imagine that fxr activation could have positive effects
on ldlc. in patients, long term  xxxd1660xxx  treatment of
cholesterol gallstones increased ldlc by 10% or more, and the effect
seemed speciﬁc to men (albers et al., 1982). in conclusion, species and
sex speciﬁcities, plus the importance of the duration of the treatment,
make it difﬁcult to predict how fxr agonists will ultimately affect
ldlc.
4.  xxxg1318xxx  synthesis and degradation
4.1. overview of the  xxxg1318xxx  pathway
hepatic  xxxg1318xxx  is the major route for elimination of body cholesterol.
its transcription rate is highly regulated by ldl-derived cholesterol
(fig. 4). indeed, cholesterol inhibits nuclear translocation of the
mature form of the sterol response element binding protein 2
(srebp2), a transcription factor that activates  xxxg1318xxx  and hmgcoa
reductase transcription. cholesterol also accelerates the degradation

272

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

of the protein of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis,
hmgcoa reductase. for a review describing these pathways, please
refer to the review by goldstein and brown (2009). this sophisticated
transcriptional regulation ensures the cell's needs are met and
prevents cholesterol accumulation. after being glycosylated,  xxxg1318xxx 
reach the cell surface, and gather in clathrin-coated pits. there, ldlbound receptor endocytosis is rapid and involves various adaptator
proteins, ultimately leading to the degradation of ldl in lysosomes
and the recycling of the receptor back to the cell membrane (jeon and
blacklow, 2005).
4.2. squalene synthase inhibitors
by targeting the rate-limiting enzyme hmgcoa reductase, statins
inhibit cholesterol synthesis at an early step and decrease levels of
mevalonate metabolites farnesyl pyrophosphates, geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphates, isoprenoids and ubiquinone (endo, 1992) (fig. 5).
how these changes result in the major side effect associated to statins,
myopathy, still remains unclear (harper and jacobson, 2007). one
could argue that some of these changes also play a role in the so-called
beneﬁcial pleiotropic effects of statins. however, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis downstream of these essential metabolites is a
reasonable strategy. one good candidate is squalene synthase because
its inhibition results in the accumulation of farnesyl pyrophosphates
that can be converted into a cascade of important metabolites like
ubiquinone (marcoff & thompson, 2007) (coenzyme q10). farnesyl
pyrophosphate is the last water soluble metabolite of the cholesterol
synthesis pathway and can be excreted in urine as a  xxxd2537xxx 
(bostedor et al., 1997). although acidosis was a major concern for
some early squalene synthase inhibitors like zaragozic acid (vaidya et
al., 1998), it was not for the more recent lapaquistat (nishimoto et al.,
2003a). assays in vitro and in vivo suggested that this drug would not
induce myopathy and would even prevent the deleterious effect of
statins (nishimoto et al., 2003b; nishimoto et al., 2007). lapaquistat
decreased ldlc and tg in various animal models, via the upregulation
of the  xxxg1318xxx  and the decrease of apob100 production (nishimoto et al.,

fig. 5. cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. cholesterol endogenous synthesis has a
major impact on circulating ldlc. statins act at an early stage by inhibiting the hmgcoa reductase that produces mevalonate (goldstein and brown, 2009). it was
suggested that inhibiting cholesterol synthesis further downstream would be as
efﬁcient and less toxic because important intermediates would still be produced, like
ubiquitinone. squalene synthase inhibition represents such a target.

2003a). additive ldlc lowering with atorvastatin (−19% compared
with atorvastatin alone) was reported in patients with primary
hypercholesterolemia who did not reach their therapeutic goal with
atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg (ldlc, b100 mg/dl) (perez et al., 2006). the
drug entered a phase iii study, but the observation of liver
abnormalities with higher doses in one and possibly two patients
led the takeda company to drop the molecule.
4.3. thyromimetics
increased thyroid hormone levels (in particular 3, 5, 3′-triiodo-lthyronine (t3)) lower serum ldlc, but also have detrimental effects
on heart and bones (kharlip & cooper, 2009). it is possible that
hepatic cholesterol depletion induces the  xxxg1318xxx  expression via srebp2, but a direct activation of the rat and human promoters via the
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  (tr) response element have been demonstrated (bakker et al., 1998; lopez et al., 2007). there are two major
thyroid hormone receptors (alpha and beta) and several isoforms created by
alternative splicing (yen, 2001). phenotyping of tralpha deﬁcient mice
revealed that this receptor plays a major role in the heart (wikstrom
et al., 1998). on the other hand, trbeta is highly expressed in the liver
and controls cholesterolemia in particular by mediating the activation
of cyp7a in response to t3 (weiss et al., 1998; gullberg et al., 2000).
thus, it appeared that selective activators of trbeta would enhance the
positive effects of thyroid hormones without exhibiting their negative
properties. a recent review describes the studies performed in various
animal models with such activators (baxter & webb, 2009). in human
hepatic cells, thyroid hormones repress cyp7a (drover et al., 2002),
suggesting that thyromimetics might not activate the last step or
reverse cholesterol transport. in fact, there is a clear lack of data
concerning putative anti-atherosclerosis properties of these compounds. such investigations were recently performed in the hyperlipidemic new zealand rabbit that exhibits a lipoprotein proﬁle similar
to that of humans and is prone to atherosclerosis (tancevski et al.,
2009). a 4-week treatment with liver-selective thyromimetic t-0681
(kat-681) induced a 60% reduction of plasma cholesterol and 70%
reduction of plasma tgs due to a reduction in both ldlc and vldlc
with no change in hdlc, cetp and lipase activity. there was an
accumulation of  xxxg1318xxx  proteins and an induction of  xxxg2013xxx  that was not
present in a short-term study, suggesting that it was a consequence of
hepatocyte cholesterol depletion and not a direct regulation. no
change in cyp7a mrna was noted. an 80% reduction in the aortic
atherosclerotic lesion area was observed upon a t-0681 8-week
treatment compared with controls.
there is only one clinical study published at present with a
thyromimetic targeting trbeta and the liver (berkenstam et al., 2008).
 xxxd2016xxx  was administered to moderately overweight and hypercholesterolemic subjects for a short period of time (2 weeks). a 40%
reduction of ldlc was observed at 14 days, with no adverse effect, in
particular concerning the heart. there was no change in hdlc, and the
ratio apob/apoai was diminished. the authors mentioned there was
no change in tgs and lp(a). plasma variations of bile acid synthesis
marker 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesterol synthesis
marker lathosterol indicated that  xxxd2016xxx  had no effect on cholesterol
synthesis, but more likely increased cholesterol conversion into bile
acids. this is in favour of an activation of cyp7a, and provides a
mechanism distinct from that of statins. the authors also noted a
small reduction in plasma tsh and a larger reduction of free and total
t4, reminiscent of what had been observed in mice with other
thyromimetics (grover et al., 2003; erion et al., 2007).
in conclusion, thyromimetics selective for trbeta and that are livertargeted provide a new and exciting area of research. recent
publications have described the ﬁrst evidence of anti-atherogenic
properties in an animal model as well as hypocholesterolemic
properties in humans. kinetic studies using stable isotopes would be
very desirable to evaluate the fate of both apob- and apoai-containing

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

lipoproteins. more data is needed to conﬁrm safety on a longer term,
in particular concerning the suppression of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–thyroid axis and the risk of hypothyroidism.
4.4.  xxxg1318xxx  mrna stability
several drugs and endogenous compounds act at a post-transcriptional level on the  xxxg1318xxx  activity by decreasing the mrna decay. we
will focus on the effects of  xxxd2925xxx  phorbol-12- xxxd2681xxx -13acetate (pma), bile acids and berberine. the reader should also
consider gemﬁbrozil that is discussed later in a speciﬁc section
concerning ﬁbrates (cf. section 4.5).
 xxxg1318xxx  mrna has a proximal 3′ untranslated region containing aurich and ucau repeat regulatory regions (wilson et al., 1998; kong et
al., 2004). it was shown early on that the  xxxg1318xxx  mrna half-life can be
prolonged by pma in hepg2 cells, and that this effect is mediated via
the distal region of the 3′untranslated region (utr) (wilson et al.,
1998). later work showed that the coding sequence and the 5′utr
region are also involved in this response (abidi et al., 2005; perez et
al., 2006); chenodeoxyholic acid increases  xxxg1318xxx  expression in hepg2
and intestinal caco-2 cells, and also in srebp2 and fxr distinct
pathways (nakahara et al., 2002). this effect is mediated through the
coding sequence of the mrna (abidi et al., 2005).
berberine is a natural alkaloïd present in various medicinal plants,
including the chinese huanglian, iranian barberry and northern
american goldenseal. these plants have long been known to have
hypotriglyceridemic and hypocholesterolemic properties, decreasing
ldlc by ∼20–25% (kong et al., 2004). berberine itself increases  xxxg1318xxx 
activity by raising the  xxxg1318xxx  mrna half-life by 3-fold in vitro
independently of cellular cholesterol content and via the activation
of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk) pathway (kong et
al., 2004; abidi et al., 2005). the berberine effect is mediated via the
au rich elements located in the ﬁrst 1 kb region of the 3′utr (kong et
al., 2004). in order to identify the protein(s) involved, li et al.
developed an elegant study based on the screening of an sirna library
targeting human rna binding proteins (li et al., 2009). they
identiﬁed that mrna binding proteins, the heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein d (hnrnp d), hnrnp i, and the kh-type splicing
regulatory protein (ksrp) are key modulators of the  xxxg1318xxx  mrna
stability in the liver. the silencing of these genes diminished any
berberine-mediated stabilization of the  xxxg1318xxx  mrna (li et al., 2009).
messenger rna stabilization by pma, berberine and bile acids is
mediated via the activation of the erk pathway (nakahara et al.,
2002; kong et al., 2004; abidi et al., 2005). of note, this pathway was
also shown to increase the activity of srebp2 and modulate the  xxxg1318xxx 
at a transcriptional level (kotzka et al., 2000). it is important to
consider that most of these works rely on in vitro experiments, and
that the responses were cell type speciﬁc, in particular for berberine
(abidi et al., 2005) and pma, a drug which also acts at a transcriptional
level (wilson et al., 1997). this might explain why gemﬁbrozil,  xxxd1660xxx 
and berberine elevate  xxxg1318xxx  mrna with similar kinetics while pma
induces a more pronounced and rapid response (abidi et al., 2005).
4.5. fibrates: molecule-speciﬁc effects on  xxxg1318xxx  transcription and mrna
fibrates (gemﬁbrozil, bezaﬁbrate, cloﬁbrate, fenoﬁbrate) have
been prescribed for decades because they lower tgs and increase
hdlc, properties that constitute the rationale to combine them with a
statin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia (high tgs, high ldlc and
low hdlc). there is some inconsistency concerning their effect on
ldlc, as will be discussed later. this should be remembered when
reviewing the molecular effects at play. in summary, fenoﬁbrate
activates  xxxg1318xxx  transcription, and gemﬁbrozil stabilizes its mrna.
fibrates are ligands of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor alpha ( xxxg1805xxx ) that regulates the expression of many
genes involved in fatty acid catabolism and lipoprotein metabolism

273

(chinetti-gbaguidi et al., 2005). this accounts for their effect on tgs.
in vitro, gemﬁbrozil and fenoﬁbric acid increased ldl binding to the
surface of hepatoma cell lines, coupled with an increase of  xxxg1318xxx  mrna
(goto et al., 1997; huang et al., 2008; kourimate et al., 2008). two
pathways might be at play. fenoﬁbric acid activated the  xxxg1318xxx 
transcription at the promoter level and in a  xxxg1805xxx -dependent way
(huang et al., 2008). the effect was mediated via the  xxxg1318xxx  sterol
response element and linked to an accumulation of the mature form
of srebp2 due to a decrease of akappat phosphorylation (huang et al.,
2008). it was previously shown that srebp2 processing is activated by
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via phosphorylation of akappat and that
inhibition of this pathway does reduce  xxxg1318xxx  mrna quantity (du et al.,
2006). the gemﬁbrozil-mediated change in  xxxg1318xxx  activity was not
abolished by the addition of the cholesterol precursor mevalonate
that would suppress an srebp2-dependent response, and did not
occur at the promoter level (goto et al., 1997). instead, gemﬁbrozil
stabilized the  xxxg1318xxx  mrna (goto et al., 1997).
the effect of ﬁbrates on ldlc in patients varies from one study to
the other. fenoﬁbrate decreased ldlc by a maximum of 30% in a short
term study (krempf et al., 2000) and gemﬁbrozil lowered ldlc by 11%
over a 5-year long trial (manninen et al., 1988). in the fenoﬁbrate
intervention and event lowering in diabetes study (field), fenoﬁbrate decreased ldlc by 12% after 4 months, but the effect was only
−5.8% after 12 months (keech et al., 2005). the more potent  xxxg1805xxx 
agonist ly518674 was tested in two clinical trials with patients with
high tg and low hdlc or high ldlc with agonists (nissen et al., 2007).
a dose dependent increase in ldlc (up to +19%) was observed in
patients with an elevated tg baseline (compared with +2.3% for
fenoﬁbrate), and a ∼15% reduction was observed in hypercholesterolemic patients with a lower tg baseline (nissen et al., 2007). in the
context of atherogenic dyslipidemia, an interesting aspect of ﬁbrate
therapy that is not seen with statins is the modiﬁcation of the
liproprotein proﬁle from small dense ldl to larger buoyant particles,
believed to be less atherogenic (guerin et al., 1996; may et al., 2008).
although the effect of ﬁbrates on ldlc is variable, their positive
effect on other parameters (tg, hdl, small dense ldl) suggest that an
association with a statin is a winning strategy. the optimism was ﬁrst
tempered by severe cases of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy that
occurred when gemﬁbrozil was added to statins. it was determined
that gemﬁbrozil competes with statin for hepatic glucuronidation
prior to renal elimination leading to high concentrations of the drug
(prueksaritanont et al., 2002). other ﬁbrates, like fenoﬁbrate, are not
metabolised by the same hepatic enzymes, and therefore it is safer to
add those to statins (prueksaritanont et al., 2002). in short term
clinical trials with patients having type 2 diabetes, metabolic
syndrome or combined dyslipidemia, adding fenoﬁbrate to a statin
proved to be more effective than each monotherapy, in term of lipid
management of ldlc, tg and hdl (grundy et al., 2005; koh et al.,
2005). of note, reduction in small dense ldl is more pronounced in
patients with high tgs concentrations, a common trait in diabetic
patients (may et al., 2008). abt-335 is the choline salt of fenoﬁbric
acid and is rapidly absorbed by the intestine without the need of ﬁrstpass metabolism compared to fenoﬁbrate, an ester of fenoﬁbric acid.
the efﬁcacy of abt-355 at lowering ldlc, tg and increasing hdlc as a
combined therapy with rosuvatstatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin over
statin monotherapy was evaluated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia in a recent clinical trial (goldberg et al., 2009; mohiuddin et al.,
2009; jones et al., 2009). no case of rhabdomyolysis was reported.
combined treatment led to a more substantial decrease of tg and a
raise in hdlc compared with statins alone, and the decrease of ldlc
was more important than with abt-335 alone, but it is noteworthy
that the decrease of ldlc was not better than that obtained with
statins alone (goldberg et al., 2009; mohiuddin et al., 2009; jones
et al., 2009).
whether the quantitative and qualitative improvements obtained
by combining a ﬁbrate and a statin actually translate into reduction of

274

p. costet / pharmacology & therapeutics 126 (2010) 263–278

cardiovascular events or mortality remains unknown. the answer
should come from the large clinical trial action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes (accord) (buse et al., 2007). it was designed to
evaluate the beneﬁt of intensive glycemic control and other
cardiovascular risk factors on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
in type 2 diabetic patients. in the context of a good glycemic control,
the lipid trial will evaluate the beneﬁt of adding fenoﬁbrate to
simvastatin on cardiovascular events rate. it will also provide more
data on the safety and tolerability of this association.
using powerful  xxxg1805xxx  agonists has been a disappointing strategy
concerning correction of ldlc. less potent agonists like fenoﬁbrates
and gemﬁbrozil are not drugs of choice to lower ldlc as a
monotherapy. a solution might come from a combined therapy with
statins and/or the development of selective  xxxg1805xxx  modulators that
have gene and tissue-speciﬁc actions. in particular, these agonists
should not increase  xxxg1684xxx  circulating concentrations as it inhibits the
 xxxg1318xxx  pathway (cf. section 4.6). data on this matter are discordant. in
vitro and mouse data indicate that ﬁbrates repress  xxxg1684xxx  expression
in a  xxxg1805xxx  dependent fashion (lambert et al., 2006; kourimate et al.,
2008). thus together with the ﬁndings described here on the
upregulation of the  xxxg1318xxx , there is accumulating evidence that
 xxxg1805xxx  ligands, in particular ﬁbrates, are not as efﬁcient at lowering
ldlc as would be expected. however, analysis of circulating  xxxg1684xxx  in
patients treated with fenoﬁbrate showed an accumulation of plasma
 xxxg1684xxx , which would be a brake on any positive ldlc lowering effect
as a monotherapy or when added to statins (troutt et al., 2009).
identifying how these negative feedback pathways take place and
whether they could be avoided would open new perspectives for
 xxxg1805xxx -based therapeutic strategies, in a similar way to how  xxxg1684xxx 
discovery did for the modulation of  xxxg1318xxx  degradation (cf. section 4.6).

4.6.  xxxg1318xxx  protein degradation: future hopes with  xxxg1684xxx 
the  xxxg1318xxx  endocytosis, degradation, and recycling to the cell surface
has been intensely studied (jeon and blacklow, 2005), but it is only
recently that the possibility of increasing the number of cell surface
receptors by preventing their degradation emerged. it began in 2003
when mutations of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9
( xxxg1684xxx ) were associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (abifadel et al., 2003). 2006 was a corner stone with the
identiﬁcation of loss of function mutations that were associated to a
29% decrease of ldlc and an 88% reduction risk for coronary heart
disease in afro-american subjects from the atherosclerosis risk in
community study (cohen et al., 2006).  xxxg1684xxx  is synthesized as a
proprotein that must cleave itself to reach the golgi apparatus, after
which it is secreted (benjannet et al., 2004), and degrades the  xxxg1318xxx 
(maxwell et al., 2005). studies in vitro and in vivo revealed that the
original gain of function mutations, as the wild type protein, increase
the lysosomal degradation of the  xxxg1318xxx  (for review (costet et al.,
2008)). in the opposite direction, patients with loss-of-function
mutations have increased ldl catabolism (cariou et al., 2009).
secreted  xxxg1684xxx  acts as a chaperone, binds to the extracellular domain
of the  xxxg1318xxx  at the epidermal-growth factor (egf)-like repeat a site,
and impairs its recycling to the cell surface (zhang et al., 2007).
several strategies are now under development for inhibiting
 xxxg1684xxx . results from the aric study suggest that inhibitors of  xxxg1684xxx  as
a monotherapy should be efﬁcient (cohen et al., 2006). however,
because  xxxg1684xxx  is also upregulated by statins at a transcriptional level,
it constitutes a brake on their efﬁciency (dubuc et al., 2004). this was
veriﬁed in  xxxg1684xxx −/− mice that are more responsive to statins,
(rashid et al., 2005) and suggested by a study that identiﬁed loss-offunction mutations in 3 out of 25 hypercholesterolemic patients, a
group that is a very good responder to statins (berge et al., 2006).
thus, there is a good chance that  xxxg1684xxx  inhibitors may also be given in
addition to statins in order to amplify their effect.

how can we inhibit  xxxg1684xxx ? research on the regulation of its
transcription identiﬁed several repressive compounds including
ﬁbrates via  xxxg1805xxx  (lambert et al., 2006; kourimate et al., 2008),
berberine (cameron et al., 2008), and  xxxd1660xxx  or the fxr agonist
gw4064 (langhi et al., 2008). in vitro, these compounds suppressed
the  xxxg1684xxx  response to statins (kourimate et al., 2008; langhi et al.,
2008). it is important to note that more validation in human is
required, as fenoﬁbrate induced an accumulation of plasma  xxxg1684xxx  in
patients (troutt et al., 2009). whether there would be an additive
effect with statins is unknown. an alternative to transcriptional
inhibition is to inhibit intracellular  xxxg1684xxx  activity so that it does not
get cleaved and processed (costet et al., 2008). we showed that it is
possible to measure the activity of cellular protein in a speciﬁc manner
and that an assay could be developed (kourimate et al., 2009).
however, current publications reporting successful inhibition of
 xxxg1684xxx  activity did not relate to the catalytic activity. promising
results were obtained with both antisense oligonucleotides and sirna
in mice and non human primates (graham et al., 2007b; frankkamenetsky et al., 2008). recent data validated the interest of using
small molecules preventing the interaction between  xxxg1684xxx  and the
 xxxg1318xxx  (mcnutt et al., 2009). the authors incubated hepg2 cells with
subfragments of the  xxxg1318xxx  corresponding to the region of interaction,
and restored the  xxxg1318xxx  expression even though cells were overexpressing the wild type  xxxg1684xxx  or gain of function mutations (mcnutt
et al., 2009). another experiment in hepg2 cells consisted of using
antibodies directed toward  xxxg1684xxx  and was also successful at
preventing the  xxxg1318xxx  degradation (duff et al., 2009). this approach
was recently applied in vivo in mice and in cynomolgus monkeys
(chan et al., 2009). in monkeys, the decrease of ldlc was maximal at
day 10 after a single injection of antibody, reaching 80% compared
with control animals (chan et al., 2009).
in conclusion, the proof-of concept concerning the relevance of
inhibiting  xxxg1684xxx  in order to lower ldlc has been given by early
studies in subjects with loss of function mutations and conﬁrmed in
animal models. there is strong evidence that this would substantially
decrease the risk for coronary heart disease although this should be
balanced by the fact that inhibiting  xxxg1684xxx  once the atherogenic
process has started, at an advanced age, or in high risk patients, might
not be as successful. it is probable that several strategies will be tested
to inhibit  xxxg1684xxx , preventing its synthesis or targeting its interaction
with the  xxxg1318xxx . in other words, an exciting race has started.
5. conclusion
there is an array of molecular pathways that can be modulated in
order to lower ldlc. the success of statin therapy has probably
delayed their complete description and prevented their evaluation in
clinical trials. the complexity of developing trials concerning ldlc
lowering is also a burden, as experience with  xxxd2078xxx  showed.
nevertheless, new guidelines that recommend lower therapeutic
goals for the ldlc, and statin-related safety issues pointed out by the
increasing number of patients under treatments, make alternative or
additional therapies highly desirable. what seemed to be a lost cause
is becoming a new frontier as new technologies, new system delivery
and new targets arise.
