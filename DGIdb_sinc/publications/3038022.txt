the dipeptidase,  xxxg649xxx  (ec 3.4.13.11), was purified to homogeneity from
rat lung, rat kidney, and hog kidney. analysis of physical parameters (subunit molecular
weights, km values for glycyldehydrophenylalanine,
ki values for  xxxg649xxx 
inhibitors, and immunoreactivity) showed the rat dipeptidases to be similar to each
other but different from the hog dipeptidase. however, all three enzymes hydrolyzed
imipenem and converted leukotriene d4 to leukotriene ed, and these activities were
inhibited by  xxxd1693xxx . o 1987 academic~ress, i~c.
the mammalian enzyme  xxxg649xxx  (dhp-i)’ has been studied extensively (l-3). it is a membrane-associated
zinc metalloenzyme with a native m, of approximately 94,000 and subunit m,‘s of
4’i,200. the enzyme cleaves many dipeptides including glycyldehydrophenylalanine (gdp) but not tripeptides, esters, or
proteins. the physiological role for dhpi is not known.  xxxg649xxx , in the
kidney, has been shown to be responsible
for the extensive renal metabolism of some
new ,&lactam antibiotics, the carbapenems
and penems (4-7). to suppress the metabolism of the carbapenem, imipenem, and
thereby to elevate its urinary recovery,
dhp-i inhibitors (e.g.,  xxxd1693xxx ) were

developed to be coadministered with imipenem.
recent reports in the literature have described mammalian dipeptidases which
play a role in the leukotriene pathway (812). the dipeptidases are responsible for
the conversion of leukotriene d4 (ltd4) to
leukotriene e4 (ltei) by removing a glytine from the dipeptide moiety in the molecule. both of these leukotrienes are biologically active in the inflammatory response (13).  xxxd1693xxx  has been shown to
be a specific inhibitor of the ltdl converting dipeptidase activities in homogenates of rabbit kidney and liver but was a
poor inhibitor of the analogous activities
in homogenates of human lung and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (14).
it is not known whether the enzyme responsible for ltd4 to ltel conversion is
the same dipeptidase responsible for carbapenem metabolism. information on this
topic is important in assessing the effects
of administering competitive inhibitors or
substrates of an enzyme involved in the inflammatory response to reduce the metabolism of an antibiotic. a recent report describes a dhp-i enzyme purified from rat

physical properties different from the rat
enzymes described here or elsewhere (9).
it was not purified by affinity chromatography with a dhp-i inhibitor nor was the
ltdl converting activity of this enzyme
shown to be inhibited by dhp-i inhibitors.
in this study, we present data on three
dhp-i enzymes purified from two rat organs-lung
and kidney-and
from hog
kidney. all three enzymes have been shown
to hydrolyze imipenem and convert ltdl
to ltel and these activities were inhibited
by  xxxd1693xxx .
the rat dipeptidases were
shown to be similar to each other by physical, immunochemical,
and enzymological
criteria and were different from the hog
dipeptidase.

the dhp-i inhibitors,
 xxxd1693xxx 
and z-2-(2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido)-2-butenoic

(mcb), were prepared as described (european patent
o-028-778-al). glycyldehydrophenylalanine
was prepared as described (15).
purification
of dehydwpeptiduses from rat lung and
rat and hog kidney. the buffer used in the purification
was tnz buffer (10 mm tris, 50 mm nacl, 0.01 mm
zncl,, ph 8.0). fresh hog kidneys were obtained from
a slaughterhouse.
the kidneys were cleared of capsular material and of the medulla. minced cortex was
homogenized in tnz (4 ml/g). rats were sacrificed by
co2 asphyxiation
and the lungs and kidneys were excised. the rat lungs were cleared of extraneous matter,
rinsed several times in tnz to wash away the blood,
and homogenized in tnz (4 ml/g). dehydropeptidase
i enzymes were purified from each of these homogenates by affinity chromatography
using procedures
described (16).
polyacr&mide

pol&onal
antibodies to puri&ed rat lung dehydrp
peptidase i. a rabbit was immunized intramuscularly
with 50 pg of rat lung dhp-i in complete freund’s
adjuvant and reimmunized three further times (im)
at lo-day intervals with 50 pg rat lung dhp-i in
freund’s incomplete adjuvant. the rabbit was sacrificed 10 days after the final immunization
by exsanguination and the blood was collected.
the igg was purified as follows. thirty milliliters
of serum, obtained from the coagulated blood, was
adjusted to 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate.
the precipitate was collected by centrifugation,
dissolved in 10 ml of 25 mm tris, 35 mm nacl, ph 8.8,
and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. the
volume of the dialyzed igg fraction was adjusted to
50 ml and was loaded onto a deae-trisacryl
ls column (5 x 15 cm) equilibrated
with the same buffer.
the column was washed with the equilibration
buffer
and the igg eluted in the void volume. the igg fraction was concentrated approximately
lo-fold prior to
use in the western procedure.
preliminary
assays for the presence of antibodies
to the rat lung dhp-i were done by the method of
ouchterlony (18).
western blots. dehydropeptidase
i samples and
protein standards of known molecular weight were
run on 5-20% sds gradient gels. the gel was electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose
filter in 0.192 m glycine,
25 mm tris, 20% methanol.
unreacted sites on the nitrocellulose
were blocked
with 3% gelatin in tbs (20 mm tris, 500 mm nacl,
ph 7.5) for 1 h. the rabbit anti-rat lung dhp-i antibody in 1% gelatin in tbs was then incubated with
the filter for 2 h. unbound antibody was removed by
washing three times for 10 min each with tbs containing 0.05% tween 20. horseradish peroxidase conjugated swine anti-rabbit
antibody in 1% gelatin in
tbs was allowed to react for 1 h. the filter was then
washed three times with tbs for 10 min, the first
wash containing 0.05% tween 20. the anti-antibody
was visualized by a 15-min incubation with the horseradish peroxidase color development reagent (60 mg
of i-chloro-1-napthol
was dissolved in 20 ml of methanol and added to 100 ml of 0.018% hz02 in tbs). the
development was terminated by placing the filter in
water.
enzyme assay. the assays for dhp-i activity were
done at 25°c in 50 mm tris-cl, ph 8.0, with varying
concentrations
of gdp. quantification
of enzyme (in
milliunits)
was performed by monitoring the rate of
decrease in absorbance at 274 nm with a gdp concentration of 50 pm (1). the molar extinction coefficient
for gdp at 274 nm was 15,300, and one unit of activity
is defined as the amount which converts one micromole
per minute. when higher concentrations of gdp were
used, reactions were followed by monitoring
the increase in absorbance at 315 nm due to formation of
a-aminocinnamic
acid (19).

of rate of imipenem hydrolysis. imipenem (0.1 mm) in 50 mm mops, ph 7.1, was incubated
at 25°c with or without enzyme. the hydrolysis was
followed by monitoring the rate of decrease in absorbance at 299 nm. this value was converted to micromoles using the difference in molar extinction coefficients between the intact and hydrolyzed compounds
(c = 9584). enzymatic reactions were corrected for
spontaneous hydrolysis.

western blot of a gel. the rabbit anti-rat
lung dipeptidase antibody did not react
with the standard proteins but reacted
strongly with both the rat lung and kidney
enzymes and very weakly with the hog dipeptidase (fig. 2).
kinetic parameters for the three enzymes were determined. k, values for gdp
were determined from lineweaver-burk
plots and ki values were derived from
dixon plots. the rat dipeptidases had similar ki values for mcb and the same km
values for gdp. the hog dipeptidase had
a lo-fold higher km value for gdp and a
higher ki value for mcb than the rat dipeptidases. ki values for  xxxd1693xxx  were in
the same range for all three enzymes (table i). inhibition by  xxxd1693xxx  and mcb was
competitive with respect to gdp in each
case (fig. 3).
enzymatic conversion of leukotriene d4
to e4 was monitored as described under
materials and methods. all three dipeptidases catalyzed this reaction.  xxxd1693xxx  (10
pm) inhibited
this conversion (fig. 4).
to confirm that these enzymes do indeed
hydrolyze imipenem as described by others
(4-7, 20), their ability to catalyze this reaction was determined as described under
materials and methods. rates of 1.6, 2.1,
and 0.98 prnol- min-‘+ mg-’ protein were
measured for the rat lung, rat kidney, and
hog kidney enzymes, respectively.
these
rates were inhibited
by more than 95%
when 10 pm  xxxd1693xxx  was added to the reaction.
discussion

previous studies with dhp-i enzymes
from rat lung, rat kidney, and hog kidney,
provided evidence that the two rat enzymes
were similar to each other and different
from the hog enzyme (20). we have confirmed these observations in terms of affinities for substrates and inhibitors,
and
extended them to include subunit molecular weight analysis and immunological
cross-reactivity.
these differences in properties and also differences in distribution
(the lung enzyme has only been reported
in rodent species (20)) indicate that the
standard rodent infection model may be

and

hitchcock

inappropriate
for the evaluation of carbapenems targeted for human use.
previous work describing the dipeptidase
conversion of ltd4 to ltel has inadequately assessed the identity of the enzyme. it has been suggested that dhp-i
catalyzes this reaction but this has not
been shown conclusively. in one study (14),
the conversion was demonstrated to be  xxxd1693xxx  sensitive, but the enzyme from
rabbit kidney was crude and activity toward gdp was not assessed. in another
study documenting the conversion, purified
dhp-i enzyme from rat kidney was used
which had  xxxd1693xxx -inhibitable
activity
against gdp (12). however, its subunit
molecular weight on sds-gel electrophoresis was estimated at 78,000 and this is
considerably larger than that documented
for the best studied dhp-i from hog kidney
(47,000). the purification
method used in
that study did not include affinity chromatography using an immobilized dhp-i
inhibitor. also, inhibition
by  xxxd1693xxx  of
the conversion of ltd4 to lte4 was not
reported.
we demonstrate here with three pure
dhp-i enzymes that they all catalyze the
conversion of leukotriene d4 to e4 and that
this reaction is inhibited by  xxxd1693xxx . the
physiological
significance of these observations is unclear since (i) dhp-i may not
be the only enzyme capable of catalyzing
this reaction; (ii) dhp-i may have other
physiological
roles, e.g., glutathione
metabolism (12); and (iii)  xxxd1693xxx  has not
been reported to cause any toxicity.
it
would be of interest to assess the effects of
 xxxd1693xxx 
in animals under conditions
where leukotriene
production
is stimulated. studies on this question and on the
relevance or lack thereof of lung metabolism of certain fl-lactams are underway.

note added in prooj since this manuscript was submitted, we have discovered that  xxxd1693xxx -sensitive
conversion of ltdl to lte, has been reported for human  xxxg649xxx  (21).
