secretion of gastric mucus phospholipids in response to beta-adrenergic  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  activation is mediated by src kinase-dependent e...  recent advances in understanding the nature of cellular responses mediated by  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  (gpcr) activation indicate that integration of the converging regulatory signals into functional cellular pathways requires  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) transactivation. in this study, we report that g protein-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor activation leading to stimulation in gastric mucus phospholipid secretion occurs with the involvement of egfr. using [14c]choline-labeled gastric mucosal cells in culture, we show that stimulatory effect of beta-adrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx , on phospholipid release was subject to a dose-dependent suppression by egfr kinase inhibitor, pd153035, as well as  xxxd3536xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx . both inhibitors, moreover, caused the reduction in the gastric mucosal cell phospholipid secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second messenger, camp as well as  xxxg67xxx  activator,  xxxd1742xxx . the gastric mucosal phospholipid secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx , furthermore, were inhibited by  xxxd1307xxx , a selective inhibitor of  xxxg2198xxx  src responsible for ligand-independent egfr phosphorylation, but not by erk inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx . the inhibition of erk, moreover, did not cause attenuation in phospholipid secretory responses to camp and  xxxd1742xxx . the findings underline the central role of egfr in mediation of gastric mucosal secretory processes, and demonstrate the requirement for src kinase-dependent egfr transactivation in regulation of gastric mucosal phospholipid secretion in response to beta-adrenergic gpcr activation.
