abstract. seven antimuscarinic compounds, used mostly
for the treatment of extrapyramidal problems, were tested in vitro in radioligand binding assays for evidence of
selectivity for two different pharmacological subtypes of
the human muscarinic receptor, m1, a predominant form
in brain, and m2, a predominant form in heart. although
biperiden, scopolamine,  xxxd3019xxx , and benztropine
showed significant selectivity in the in vitro assays, it is
likely that in clinical practice biperiden would be the drug
of choice to avoid any antimuscarinic effects on the heart.
key words" parkinsonism d r u g s -  xxxd2965xxx  - m1 and
m 2 receptors

clinicians use antimuscarinic compounds to lessen the
extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic drugs used in
the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses.
their therapeutic effects occur through antagonism in
the brain of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the
predominate type of cholinergic receptor in this organ.
muscarinic receptors have been further subdivided
pharmacologically (m1, m2, and m3). in brain the major
type is the m~ subclass (hammer et at. 1980; watson et
al. 1983), that is characterized by high affinity for the
selective m1 antagonist,  xxxd2965xxx  (hammer et al.
1980).
however, molecular biologists have now identified
five subtypes of the muscarinic receptor (rot, m2, m3,
m4, and m5) (bonner 1989). pharmacological studies
with cloned receptors indicate that ml, m2, and m3
receptors correspond most closely to m1, m2, and m3
receptors. these studies continue to support the use of
high-affinity  xxxd2965xxx  binding to define the m, (ml)
receptor. in addition, they show how difficult it is to
distinguish pharmacologically the remaining subtypes of
receptors. in situ hybridization studies show that the

brain expresses to varying degrees all five subtypes of
mrna. heart expresses only m2 m r n a glandular tissues (such as lacrimal and parotid glands) express both m 1
and m3 mrnas, and smooth muscle (such as intestines
and urinary bladder) express both m2 and m3 mrnas
(bonner 1989).
troublesome peripheral side effects often accompany
the use of antimuscarinic compounds. these effects include blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary
retention, and tachycardia. these occur especially in
aged patients and in patients on a combination of an
antimuscarinic drug and a neuroleptic that has antimuscarinic properties as well (for example, thioridazine)
(black et al. 1985).
it is likely that antagonism of separate subclasses of
muscarinic receptors (m2 and m3), characterized in part
by a low affinity for  xxxd2965xxx , cause most, if not all,
of these side effects. clinically, it would be helpful to use
selective m1 antagonists in the treatment of extrapyramidal problems to avoid most of these peripheral
antimuscarinic side effects caused by m2 and m3 blockade.
while the synthetic antimuscarinic agents used in
psychiatry appear to have fewer peripheral side effects
than belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine)
(ghose 1985), there is little precise information about the
binding characteristics or possible pharmacological differences between the commonly used drugs (syvalahti et
al. 1988). biperiden (syvalahti et al. 1987), trihexyphenidyl
(luber-narod and potter 1983; tien and wallace 1985;
giachetti et al. t986a), and under certain conditions,
scopolamine (luber-narod and potter 1983), are m1selective antagonists based on in vitro rat brain binding
studies and neurophysiologic studies. however, there are
no published human studies examining the selectivity of
antimuscarinic agents.
by using radioligand binding assays, we tested seven
clinically useful antimuscarinic compounds for their
selectivity for muscarinic binding sites in two different
human tissues. we used human brain frontal cortex and
[3h] xxxd2965xxx  for studying m1 sites, which represent

163
77% o f total muscarinic binding in this p a r t o f the brain
(lin et ai. 1986); and h u m a n atria a n d [3h]quinuclidinyl
benzilate ([3h]qnb), a non-selective muscarinic antagonist ( y a m a m u r a a n d snyder 1974), for studying m2
sites, which represent greater t h a n 95 % o f total muscarinic binding in this tissue ( w a t s o n et al. 1983). w e f o u n d
some but n o t all antimuscarinics to be highly selective for
the m~ muscarinic subtype.

materials and methods
human brain tissue was obtained at autopsy 4 h after death of
subjects for whom there was no history of mental illness or use of
psychotropic drugs. tissue was immediately dissected into regions
and stored in a liquid nitrogen refrigerator at - 180° c until use.
to prepare homogenate for [3h] xxxd2965xxx  binding, the tissue was
thawed, and gray matter from frontal cortex was dissected. this was
homogenized with a brinkmann polytron (westbury, ny, usa)
for 60 s on setting 8, in 10 vol 0.05 m tris-hc1 (ph 7.7). after
the material was centrifuged at 38 000 g for 20 min, the resulting
pellet was resuspended in 10 vol buffer, and the centrifugation step
was repeated. the final pellet was resuspended in buffer to obtain
tissue concentrations of 10 mg wet weight/ml buffer. homogenates
were stored at - 2 8 ° c before use.
human cardiac atrial tissue was obtained at autopsy 4-6 h after
death, from a patient with no history of cardiac disease and no
history of use of cardiac or anticholinergic drugs. all visible fat and
connective tissue were excised and discarded, and the tissue was
stored at -180 ° c. for the preparation of homogenate for
ph]qnb binding, the tissue was thawed, minced with scissors,
suspended in 10 vol 0.05 m na-kpo 4 buffer, ph 7.4, and homogenized with the brinkmann polytron for two 20-s cycles, separated
by 30 s on ice. further preparation was identical to that for frontal
cortex.

radioligand binding assays. all incubations were at 37° c in a total
volume of 1 ml. a 100 gl aliquot of radiolabelled compound was
added to each tube (final concentrations: [3h] xxxd2965xxx  1.2 nm,
[3h]qnb 0.12 nm). graduated concentrations of unlabelled compounds (100 gl/tube) were then added, each dose in duplicate. na-k
phosphate buffer (0.05 m, ph 7.4) was added to adjust to the final
volume. thawed frontal cortex homogenate (4 rag) ([3h] xxxd2965xxx ) or cardiac atrial homogenate ([3h]qnb) was added to each
tube to begin the 30-rain incubations. incubations were ended by
rapid vacuum filtration (brandel filtration apparatus, gaithersburg,
md, usa) of the contents of each tube through glass fiber filters
(whatman gf/b), followed by three rapid washings (4 ml each)
with na-k phosphate buffer. filters were each incubated for at least
5 h with 7 ml safety-solve counting cocktail (research products
international, mt. prospect, il, usa). radioactivity was then
determined by a beckman liquid scintillation counter (irvine, ca,
usa). nonspecific binding was defined as the amount bound of
[3h] xxxd2965xxx  or [3tt]qnb in the presence of 1 p.m or 10 ~tm
atropine, respectively. specific binding, calculated by subtracting
nonspecific from total binding, ranged from 70 to 89% of total
binding for ph] xxxd2965xxx  and 92 to 93% for ph]qnb.
analysis of data. affinities (k), defined as the inverse of the inhibitor constant (ki), were calculated by using the ligand (munson and rodbard i980) program, modified to give hill coefficients.
results represent mean values of at least three independent experiments. each experiment was determined in duplicate.
materials. [3h] xxxd2965xxx  (82.3-87.0 ci/mmol) and [3h]qnb
(26.8 ci/mmol) were bought from new england nuclear (boston,
ma, usa). unlabelled drugs were obtained as follows: atropine,
diphenhydramine and scopolamine from sigma (st louis, mo,
usa);  xxxd2965xxx  from boehringer-ingleheim inc. (ridgefield,

ct, usa); biperiden from knoll pharmaceuticals (whippany, n j,
usa);  xxxd3019xxx  from burroughs-wetlcome (research triangle
park, nc, usa); l-qnb from hoffman-laroche, inc. (nutley,
nj, usa); benztropine from merck, sharp and dohme (west
point, pa, usa); and trihexyphenidyl from lederle laboratories
(pearl river, ny, usa).

the rank order of selectivity for m~ over m2 receptors for these antimuscarinic drugs was biperiden>
scopolamine >  xxxd3019xxx  > benztropine > trihexyphenidyl > diphenhydramine > atropine. the most selective compounds (biperiden, scopolamine and  xxxd3019xxx ) showed 13 to 41 fold selectivity for mi (brain)
versus m2 (atrial) binding sites. hill coefficients for all
compounds were essentially equal to unity, ranging from
0.90 to 0.99 for binding assays with [3h] xxxd2965xxx , and
from 0.91 to 1.12 for assays with [3h]qnb.

discussion

our study, the first to compare affinities of antimuscarinic compounds for m~ receptors of human brain with m2
receptors of human heart, provides evidence that some
antimuscarinic compounds used clinically to treat extrapyramidal problems have selectivity for the m1 muscarinic subtype. this is the predominate class of muscarinic receptors in most parts of the brain.
our affinities for  xxxd2965xxx  and qnb were similar
to those reported in rat brain (hammer et al. 1980;
watson et al. 1983), human stellate ganglion (watson et
al. 1984), and human brain (garvey et al. 1984; lin et
al. 1986). furthermore, the equilibrium dissociation constant for the m2-selective drug, af-dx 116 (giachetti
et al. 1986b), at [3h] xxxd2965xxx  binding sites in human
frontal cortex, was in the range of that expected for
binding to an m1 site (lazareno and roberts 1989;
mckinney et al. 1989).
hill coefficients for all compounds were not significantly different from unity, indicating that the drugreceptor interactions obeyed the law of mass action. that
is, binding was to only one site under the conditions of
our assays. the lack of competition between  xxxd2965xxx 

and [3h]qnb in atrial preparations indicates that
[3h]qnb bound almost totally to m2 sites in this tissue.
biperiden, scopolamine,  xxxd3019xxx , and benztropine each showed selectivity for m1 binding sites
(table 1) that was similar to  xxxd2965xxx , which shows
10-100 fold selectivity for m1 sites (hammer et al. 1980;
hammer and giachetti 1982; watson et al. 1983). our
results also confirm previous reports in animal tissue that
biperiden (syvalahti et al. 1987), scopolamine (lubernarod and potter 1983), and trihexyphenidyl (lubernarod and potter 1983; tien and wallace 1985; giachetti et al. 1986a) are ml-selective.
it is generally considered that a compound shows
selectivity for the  xxxg447xxx  over the  xxxg448xxx  when
its affinity for the former is about 10 times that of the
latter. by this criterion biperiden, scopolamine,  xxxd3019xxx , and benztropine are considered selective;
trihexyphenidyl and diphenhydramine, marginally so;
and atropine is probably not selective. however, from a
clinical standpoint, a drug may be considered selective
when in the process of occupying most (for example,
90%) of the m1 receptors, it is occupying few (for example, 25% or less) of the m2 sites. calculating receptor
occupancies at each receptor site for a drug and assuming
no competition by endogenous acetylcholine, such a condition is met when the affinity ratio of a drug for the mi
and m2 receptors is at least 27. thus, biperiden may
clearly be the drug of choice to use in clinical practice to
avoid any antimuscarinic effects on the heart. another
study seems to support this idea (belmaker et al. 1988).
an unanswered question concerning these drugs is
whether they have similar affinities for the m 3 muscarinic
receptors found in glandular tissue and intestinal smooth
muscle. studies with cell lines transfected with genes for
each receptor will help answer these questions. such
knowledge may allow the clinician to select specific antimuscarinic drugs for patients with specific risk factors
such as cardiac arrhythmias, xerostomia, constipation,
and urinary retention.
