1 continuous infusions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) inhibit the tachycardiac responses to
preganglionic (c7-t1) sympathetic stimulation in pithed rats pretreated with desipramine. the present
study identified the pharmacological profile of this inhibitory action of 5-ht.
2 the inhibition induced by intravenous (i.v.) continuous infusions of 5-ht (5.6 mg kg1 min1) on
sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses remained unaltered after i.v. treatment with saline or
the antagonists gr 127935 (5-ht1b/1d), the combination of way 100635 (5-ht1a) plus gr 127935,
ritanserin (5-ht2),  xxxd3451xxx  (5-ht3/4), ly215840 (5-ht7) or a cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors
consisting of yohimbine (a2),  xxxd3000xxx  (a1), ritanserin, gr 127935, way 100635 and indomethacin
(cyclooxygenase), but was abolished by methiothepin (5-ht1/2/6/7 and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b). these
drugs, used in doses high enough to block their respective receptors/mechanisms, did not modify the
sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses per se.
3 i.v. continuous infusions of the agonists 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct; 5-ht1/7 and
recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b), cp 93,129 (r5-ht1b), sumatriptan (5-ht1b/1d), pnu-142633 ( xxxg1110xxx ) and
ergotamine (5-ht1b/1d and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b) mimicked the above sympatho-inhibition to 5-ht.
in contrast, the agonists indorenate (5-ht1a) and ly344864 ( xxxg1112xxx ) were inactive. interestingly, 5ct-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition was abolished by methiothepin, the cocktail of antagonists/
inhibitors, gr 127935 or the combination of sb224289 (5-ht1b) plus brl15572 ( xxxg1110xxx ), but
remained unchanged when sb224289 or brl15572 were given separately.
4 therefore, 5-ht-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition, being unrelated to 5-ht2, 5-ht3,  xxxg1117xxx ,  xxxg1112xxx , 5-ht7 receptors, a1/2-adrenoceptor or prostaglandin synthesis, seems to be primarily mediated by
(i) 5-ht1 (probably 5-ht1b/1d) receptors and (ii) a novel mechanism antagonized by methiothepin
that, most likely, involves putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors.

introduction
the complexity of cardiovascular effects produced by
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht), including bradycardia
or tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension and vasodilatation or vasoconstriction, has been explained by the capability
of this monoamine to interact with different receptors in

the central nervous system, on the autonomic ganglia
and postganglionic nerve endings, on vascular smooth muscle
and endothelium and on the cardiac tissue (see saxena &
villalón, 1990; 1991; villalón et al., 1997; saxena et al.,
1998). with respect to 5-ht-induced tachycardia, this is
notoriously species-dependent and is mediated, directly and/or
indirectly, either by 5-ht2a (rat), 5-ht3 (rabbit),  xxxg1117xxx 
(human, pig) or 5-ht7 (cat) receptors, or by tyramine-like
(guinea-pig) or unidentified mechanisms (see saxena &

a. sánchez-lópez et al

villalón, 1990; 1991; villalón et al., 1997; centurión et al.,
2002).
5-ht interferes with sympathetic neurotransmission by
stimulating 5-ht1 receptors located prejunctionally in a wide
variety of blood vessels and other organs (see saxena et al.,
1998), including the systemic vasculature in pithed rats
(villalón et al., 1995; 1998). interestingly, our group has also
shown in pithed rats that continuous infusions of 5-ht dosedependently inhibited the tachycardiac responses to selective
stimulation of the preganglionic (c7-t1) cardiac sympathetic
outflow (villalón et al., 1999). admittedly, this study did not
measure sympathetic nerve activity directly, but the electrically
induced noradrenaline release could be estimated indirectly by
measurement of the evoked tachycardiac response. under
these conditions, the responses to 5-ht were considered to be
sympatho-inhibitory, as the monoamine is capable of inhibiting the tachycardiac responses to sympathetic stimulation, but
not those to exogenous noradrenaline (villalón et al., 1999).
on this basis, the present study was designed to characterize
the pharmacological profile of the above 5-ht-induced
cardiac sympatho-inhibition. therefore, based on the classification schemes proposed by the nc-iuphar subcommittee
on 5-ht receptors (see hoyer et al., 1994; saxena et al., 1998),
we investigated if the sympatho-inhibitory action of 5-ht
could be: (i) blocked by the antagonists methiothepin (5-ht1/2/
6/7 and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b), ritanserin (5 – ht2),  xxxd3451xxx 
(5-ht3/4), ly215840 (5-ht7), gr 127935 (5-ht1b/1d), the
combination of way 100635 (5-ht1a) plus gr 127935 or a
cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors consisting of yohimbine (a2),
 xxxd3000xxx  (a1), ritanserin, gr 127935, way 100635 and
indomethacin (cyclooxygenase) and (ii) mimicked by the
agonists 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct; 5-ht1/7 and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b), indorenate (5-ht1a), cp 93,129 (r5-ht1b),
sumatriptan (5-ht1b/1d), pnu-142633 ( xxxg1110xxx ), ly344864
( xxxg1112xxx ) or ergotamine (5-ht1b/1d and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b)
(see table 1 for affinity constants). moreover, 5-ct-induced

cardiac sympatho-inhibitory mechanisms induced by 5-ht

sympatho-inhibition was analysed after some of the above
antagonists, as well as after sb224289 or brl15572 (given
alone or in combination). a preliminary account of this
investigation was presented at the satellite meeting ‘serotonin:
from the molecule to the clinic’ (villalón et al., 2000).

methods
animals
male wistar normotensive rats (240– 280 g) were used in the
present experiments. the animals were maintained at a 12/12-h
light– dark cycle (light beginning at 07:00) and housed in a
special room at constant temperature (22721c) and humidity
(50%), with food and water freely available in their home cages.

general methods
experiments were carried out in a total of 151 rats. after
anaesthesia with ether and cannulation of the trachea, the rats
were pithed by inserting a stainless-steel rod through the orbit
and foramen magnum into the vertebral foramen (shipley &
tilden, 1947). the animals were artificially ventilated with
room air using an ideal palmer pump (56 strokes min1 and a
stroke volume of 20 ml kg1), as previously established by
kleinman & radford (1964). subsequently, the pithing rod was
replaced by an electrode and enamelled, except for 1 cm length
7 cm from the tip, so that the uncovered segment was situated
at c7-t1 of the spinal cord to allow selective stimulation of the
cardiac sympathetic outflow (gillespie et al., 1970; villalón
et al., 1999). after bilateral vagotomy, catheters were placed in
the left and right femoral veins, for the infusion of agonists and
for the administration of antagonists, respectively, and the left
carotid artery, connected to a statham pressure transducer
(p23 xl), for the recording of blood pressure. heart rate was

measured with a tachograph (7p4, grass instrument co.,
quincy, ma, u.s.a.) triggered from the blood pressure signal.
both blood pressure and heart rate were recorded simultaneously by a model 7 grass polygraph (grass instrument co.,
quincy, ma, u.s.a.). prior to electrical stimulation, the
animals received  xxxd2174xxx  (25 mg kg1, i.v.) to avoid electrically induced muscular twitching.
since the sympatho-inhibitory responses to 5-ht are
particularly more pronounced at lower frequencies of stimulation, all animals were systematically pretreated with 50 mg kg1
(i.v.) of desipramine (a noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor)
before each stimulus – response curve (s – r curve), as previously described (villalón et al., 1999). the body temperature
of each pithed rat was maintained at 371c by a lamp and
monitored with a rectal thermometer.

experimental protocol
after a stable haemodynamic condition for at least 30 min,
baseline values of diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were
determined. then, the preganglionic cardiac sympathetic
outflow was stimulated to elicit tachycardiac responses by
applying trains of 10 s (monophasic rectangular pulses of 2 ms
duration and 50 v), at increasing frequencies of stimulation
(0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 hz). when the heart rate had
returned to baseline levels, the next frequency was applied; this
procedure was systematically performed until the s – r curve
was completed (about 30 min). at this point, the animals (151
in total) were divided into five groups.
the first group (n ¼ 33) was subdivided into six subgroups
that received an i.v. bolus injection of, respectively: (i)
physiological saline (control; 1 ml kg1; n ¼ 5) or the 5-ht
receptor antagonists (see table 1): (ii) methiothepin (5-ht1/2/6/
1
7 and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b; 300 mg kg ; n ¼ 6); (iii) ritanserin
(5-ht2; 100 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); (iv)  xxxd3451xxx  (5-ht3/4;
3000 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); (v) ly215840 (5-ht7; 1000 mg kg1;
n ¼ 6); or (vi) a cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors (n ¼ 6)
consisting of yohimbine (a2-adrenoceptors; 1000 mg kg1),
 xxxd3000xxx  (a1-adrenoceptors; 100 mg kg1), ritanserin (5-ht2;
100 mg kg1), gr 127935 (5-ht1b/1d; 300 mg kg1), way
100635 (5-ht1a; 30 mg kg1) and indomethacin (cyclooxygenase; 5000 mg kg1). this cocktail was used in an attempt
to cover as much as possible the spectrum of blockade of
methiothepin (except the blockade of putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b
receptors), a nonselective drug which: (i) displays high affinity
for (and blocks in several in vivo preparations) a wide variety
of receptors including a1/2-adrenoceptors, 5-ht1a/1b/1d and
5-ht2 receptors (leysen, 1985; hoyer, 1988; saxena &
villalón, 1990; 1991; hoyer et al., 1994; villalón et al., 1995;
1997) and (ii) inhibits cyclooxygenase (see leysen, 1985;
martin, 1994).  xxxd1891xxx  min after the administration of above
compounds, an s – r curve was elicited again, as described
above, to analyse their effects on the sympathetically induced
tachycardiac responses per se.
the second group (n ¼ 27) was subdivided into five
subgroups that received an i.v. bolus injection of, respectively:
(i) physiological saline (1 ml kg1; n ¼ 5); (ii) methiothepin
(300 mg kg1; n ¼ 6); (iii) ritanserin (100 mg kg1; n ¼ 6); (iv)
 xxxd3451xxx  (3000 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); or (v) ly215840
(1000 mg kg1; n ¼ 5).  xxxd1891xxx  min after the dose of saline or the
corresponding antagonist, all the subgroups received an i.v.
continuous infusion of 5-ht (5.6 mg kg1 min1) by a wpi

model sp100i pump (world precision instruments inc.,
sarasota, fl, u.s.a.). at 20 min after starting the infusion,
an s – r curve was elicited, as described above during the
infusion of 5-ht. once the s – r curve was completed, the
infusion was stopped.
the third group (n ¼ 42) was subdivided into eight subgroups
that received, respectively, an i.v. continuous infusion of: (i)
physiological saline (control; 0.02 ml min1; n ¼ 4) twice; as well
as the agonists (see table 1); (ii) 5-ct (5-ht1/7 and
recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b; 0.1 and 0.3 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 4); (iii)
indorenate (5-ht1a; 30 and 100 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 6); (iv) cp
93,129 (r5-ht1b; 30 and 100 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 7); (v) sumatriptan (5-ht1b/1d; 30 and 100 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 6); (vi) pnu–
142633 ( xxxg1110xxx , 30 and 100 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 5); (vii)
ly344864 ( xxxg1112xxx ; 30 and 100 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 5); or (viii)
ergotamine (5-ht1b/1d and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b; 1 and
1.8 mg kg1 min1; n ¼ 5). at 20 min after starting each infusion,
an s – r curve was elicited, as described above, during the
infusion of the corresponding compound.
the fourth group (n ¼ 16) was subdivided into three
subgroups that received, respectively, an i.v. bolus injection
of the 5-ht1 receptor antagonists (see table 1): (i) gr 127935
(5-ht1b/1d; 300 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); (ii) the combination of way
100635 (5-ht1a; 30 mg kg1) plus gr 127935 (300 mg kg1)
(n ¼ 5); or (iii) the cocktail of drugs previously described
(n ¼ 6; see the experimental protocol of the first group). at
10 min after the administration of antagonists, the three
subgroups received an i.v. continuous infusion of 5-ht
(5.6 mg kg1 min1), as described above. at 20 min after
starting the infusion, an s – r curve was elicited again, during
the infusion of 5-ht.
the fifth group (n ¼ 33) was subdivided into seven
subgroups that received an i.v. bolus injection of, respectively:
(i) physiological saline (1 ml kg1; n ¼ 5), or the antagonists: (ii)
methiothepin (300 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); (iii) the cocktail of drugs
previously described (n ¼ 4; see the experimental protocol of
the first group); (iv) gr 127935 (5-ht1b/1d; 300 mg kg1;
n ¼ 4); (v) sb224289 (selective 5-ht1b; 300 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); (vi)
brl15572 (selective  xxxg1110xxx ; 300 mg kg1; n ¼ 5); or (vii) the
combination of sb224289 plus brl15572 (300 mg kg1 each;
n ¼ 5).  xxxd1891xxx  min after the administration of saline or the
corresponding antagonist, all the subgroups received an i.v.
continuous infusion of 5-ct (0.1 mg kg1 min1), as described
above. at 20 min after starting the infusion, an s – r curve was
elicited again, during the infusion of 5-ct. once the s – r curve
was completed, the infusion was stopped.

stimulation in the saline- and the agonist-infused animals were
determined. the difference between the changes in heart rate
within one subgroup of animals was evaluated by student –
newman – keuls’ test, once a two-way repeated-measures
analysis of variance (randomized block design) had revealed
that the samples represented different populations (steel &
torrie, 1980). statistical significance was accepted at po0.05
(two-tailed). the f-values, degrees of freedom and p-values
are reported for the two factors (i.e. f1 and p1 refer to factor 1,
the pharmacological treatment, and f2 and p2 refer to factor 2,
the frequency of stimulation), and the subscript values in the
parentheses close to f represent the degrees of freedom of each
factor.

cardiac sympatho-inhibitory mechanisms induced by 5-ht

results
systemic haemodynamic variables
the baseline values of diastolic blood pressure and heart rate
in the 151 rats were, respectively, 5372 mmhg and
28173 beats min1. after the first i.v. bolus injection of
desipramine (50 mg kg1), the baseline values of the aforementioned variables significantly increased to 5773 mmhg and
28773 beats min1, respectively. the subsequent treatments
with desipramine did not change the baseline values of
diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.
in the different subgroups of rats pretreated with desipramine, the baseline values of diastolic blood pressure and heart
rate were not significantly modified by: (i) the i.v. bolus
injections of saline, methiothepin, ritanserin,  xxxd3451xxx ,
ly215840, gr 127935, the combination of way 100635
plus gr 127935, sb224289, brl15572, the combination of
sb224289 plus brl15572 or the cocktail of drugs previously
described (data not shown), or (ii) the continuous infusions of
saline, 5-ht, indorenate, cp 93,129, pnu-142633, sumatriptan or ly344864 (data not shown). only 5-ct and ergotamine
produced, respectively, moderate decreases and increases in
blood pressure without changes in heart rate (data not shown).

electrical stimulation of the preganglionic (c7-t1)
cardiac sympathetic outflow
the onset of the responses induced by stimulation (0.01 – 3 hz)
of the preganglionic sympathetic nerves (c7-t1) was immediate, and resulted in frequency-dependent increases in heart rate
(see below). it must be emphasized that, in all cases, these
increases in heart rate were statistically significant when
compared to baseline values (p2o0.001). these tachycardiac
responses are due to selective cardiostimulation, since only
negligible and inconsistent increases in diastolic blood pressure
were observed (data not shown), as previously shown
(gillespie et al., 1970; villalón et al., 1999).

effect of saline, 5-ht receptor antagonists or the cocktail
of drugs on the tachycardiac responses to cardiac
sympathetic nerve stimulation per se
figure 1 shows the sympathetically induced tachycardiac
responses before (control s – r curves) and after i.v. treatment
with saline (1 ml kg1), methiothepin (300 mg kg1), ritanserin

gr 127935 (300 mg kg1), way 100635 (30 mg kg1) and
indomethacin (5000 mg kg1). as can be observed, the sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses remained without
significant changes after the i.v. administration of saline
(figure 1a; f1(1,4) ¼ 1.75; p1 ¼ 0.256 and f2(5,20) ¼ 53.72),
methiothepin (figure 1b; f1(1,5) ¼ 0.505; p1 ¼ 0.509 and

receptors producing sympatho-inhibition (villalón et al., 2001).

discussion
general
apart from the implications discussed below, our study shows
that cardiac sympatho-inhibition to 5-ht in pithed rats is
most probably mediated by two main sympatho-inhibitory
mechanisms, namely: (i) 5-ht1 receptors and (ii) a novel
mechanism involving putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors. for this
reason, from now on, 5-ct, ergotamine and methiothepin will
be described as compounds with activity at 5-ht1b/1d and
recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors (see table 1).

systemic haemodynamic changes
the fact that diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were
significantly increased after desipramine can be attributed to

cardiac sympatho-inhibitory mechanisms induced by 5-ht

731

an inhibition of noradrenaline uptake (bechtel et al., 1986).
moreover, the potentiation of the sympathetically induced
tachycardiac responses after desipramine (for comparison, see
villalón et al., 1995; 1999) has relevance for the purpose of the
present study. thus, the cardiac sympatho-inhibitory effects of
5-ht (see figure 2a) were, coincidentally, more pronounced at
lower frequencies of stimulation (see langer, 1980). however,
it could be alternatively argued that the proposed sympathoinhibitory action of 5-ht (figure 2) and related agonists
(figure 3) may have been due to tachyphylaxis of the
sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses. however,
this is unlikely since such responses remained unchanged after
i.v. saline (figures 1a and 3a); an additional conclusion drawn
from this is that no time-dependent changes occurred in our
experiments.
the fact that the sympathetically induced tachycardiac
responses remained essentially unchanged after i.v. saline,
methiothepin, ritanserin,  xxxd3451xxx , ly215840 or the cocktail of drugs (see figure 1) indicates that these compounds
were devoid of any effects on the above tachycardiac responses
per se. these findings, coupled to the lack of effect of the above
compounds on baseline diastolic blood pressure and heart rate
(not shown), suggest that any effect of a given antagonist on 5ht-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition is due to a direct
interaction of the antagonist with its respective receptors on
the cardiac sympathetic nerves.

pharmacological profile of the cardiac sympathoinhibitory action of 5-ht in the rat
taken collectively, our findings support the notion that 5-ht1
(but not 5-ht2, 5-ht3,  xxxg1117xxx ,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7) receptors may
mediate, at least in part, the cardiac sympatho-inhibitory
action to 5-ht, since this response was: (i) resistant to
blockade by ritanserin,  xxxd3451xxx  and ly215840 (see
figure 2) at doses that are sufficient to antagonize, respectively, 5-ht2 (centurión et al., 2002), 5-ht3/4 (villalón et al.,
1990; 1991) and 5-ht7 (centurión et al., 2000) receptors
mediating cardiovascular responses and (ii) antagonized by
methiothepin (figure 2b) at doses that are sufficient to
antagonize ‘5-ht1-like’ receptors (saxena & villalón, 1990;
1991; villalón et al., 1995). nevertheless, based on the current
classification scheme of 5-ht receptors (see hoyer et al., 1994;
saxena et al., 1998), the above notion supporting the
involvement of methiothepin-sensitive 5-ht1 receptors is
admittedly weak, since: (i) the 5-ht1 receptor family is highly
heterogeneous and includes 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx ,  xxxg1111xxx 
and  xxxg1112xxx  receptor subtypes and (ii) methiothepin blocks, in
addition to all of these 5-ht1 subtypes, recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b
receptors. evidently, the use of selective agonists and
antagonists at the different 5-ht1 receptor subtypes (see
below) becomes crucial to confirm the above notion.

apparent rank order of potency of some agonists causing
cardiac sympatho-inhibition and its blockade by some
antagonists
our results show that 5-ht-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition cannot be: (i) mimicked by indorenate or ly344864 (see
figure 3) which are agonists at, respectively, 5-ht1a (dompert
et al., 1985) and  xxxg1112xxx  (phebus et al., 1997) receptors and
(ii) blocked by way 100635 (see figure 4b and c), a potent

 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist (fletcher et al., 1996), at doses
sufficient to antagonize sympatho-inhibitory 5-ht1a receptors
(villalón et al., 1998). hence, these results strongly suggest that
5-ht1a and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors are not involved.
in contrast, the 5-ht receptor agonists, 5-ct, ergotamine
(both 5-ht1b/1d and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b; hoyer et al., 1994),
cp 93,129 (r5-ht1b; macor et al., 1990), sumatriptan (5-ht1b/1d;
hoyer et al., 1994) and pnu-142633 ( xxxg1110xxx ; pregenzer et al.,
1999), which failed to modify the tachycardiac responses to
exogenous noradrenaline (data not shown), mimicked the
sympatho-inhibition to 5-ht with an apparent rank order of
agonist potency of 5-ctxergotamine45-ht4sumatriptan ¼ pnu-142633xcp 93,129. pending the use of selective
antagonists, this suggests a possible correlation with the
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor subtypes. several possible
explanations for these differences in agonist potencies may
include: (i) the use of ‘second messengers’ and functional
(cardiac sympatho-inhibition) responses; (ii) tissue-dependent
factors such as the density of receptors and coupling efficiency
and/or (iii) drug-dependent factors such as the affinity of 5-ht
and related agonists for each of these receptors (i.e. 5-ht1b,
 xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1118xxx /5b; see table 1).
the possible involvement of 5-ht1b/1d receptors gains
weight by the fact that 5-ct-induced sympatho-inhibition
was abolished by: (i) the 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist gr
127935 (skingle et al., 1996) (see figure 5c and d) at doses that
antagonize sympatho-inhibitory 5-ht1b/1d receptors (villalón
et al., 1998) and (ii) the combination of sb224289 plus
brl15572 (see figure 5g), which are selective antagonists at,
respectively, 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (hagan et al., 1997)
at doses that completely block 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
in vivo (de vries et al., 1998). interestingly, the fact that
sb224289 alone apparently failed to block the responses to
5-ct (see figure 5e) may be explained by the additional
capability of 5-ct to stimulate  xxxg1110xxx  (and probably also
 xxxg1118xxx /5b) receptors; this may have overshadowed the selective
antagonism of 5-ht1b receptors with sb224289. a similar line
of reasoning may apply to the selective antagonism of  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors with brl15572 alone (figure 5f). this led us to
hypothesize that if the sympatho-inhibitory responses to 5-ct
involve the stimulation of two (or even three) receptors, the
antagonism of at least two of them (with gr 127935 or the
combination of sb224289 plus brl15572) would be mandatory to produce a complete blockade. this view is reinforced by
the fact that: (i) methiothepin (which antagonizes 5-ht1b/1d
and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors) also abolished the
responses to 5-ct (see figure 5b) and (ii) the cardiac
sympatho-inhibition to the selective agonists cp 93,129
(5-ht1b) and pnu-142633 ( xxxg1110xxx ) are completely and
specifically blocked by, respectively, sb224289 (5-ht1b) and
brl15572 ( xxxg1110xxx ) (villalón et al., 2000). admittedly, 5-ht
displays high affinity for  xxxg1111xxx  (and  xxxg1112xxx ) receptors; however,
their involvement seems unlikely as 5-ct displays a very low
affinity for  xxxg1111xxx  (and  xxxg1112xxx ) receptors (adham et al., 1993).

apparent failure of gr 127935, the combination of way
100635 plus gr 127935 or the cocktail of drugs to
antagonize the 5-ht-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition
in order to confirm the previously suggested involvement of
gr 127935-sensitive 5-ht1b/1d receptors with 5-ht, it was
decided to analyse, in principle, the effect of gr 127935 on
british journal of pharmacology vol 140 (4)

cardiac sympatho-inhibitory mechanisms induced by 5-ht

5-ht-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition. unexpectedly,
and contrasting with methiothepin (figure 2b), gr 127935
given alone (figure 4a) or in combination with way 100635
(figure 4b) failed to antagonize the response to 5-ht at doses
high enough to completely antagonize, respectively, the 5ht1b/1d and 5-ht1a receptors (villalón et al., 1998). in view of
this lack of blockade by gr 127935, we considered it
unnecessary to investigate the potential blockade of 5-htinduced sympatho-inhibition by sb224289 and/or brl15572.
although the simplest interpretation of these findings would
apparently suggest that 5-ht1b/1d receptors are not involved, it
should be kept in mind that 5-ht, as an endogenous ligand,
can stimulate a wide variety of known (5-ht1-5-ht7) and
unknown (orphan, novel, unclassified) receptors. therefore, it
is reasonable to assume that, besides 5-ht1b/1d receptors, 5ht-induced sympatho-inhibition involves the additional
participation of a novel mechanism which overshadows the
blockade of 5-ht1b/1d receptors with gr 127935. this novel
mechanism, as discussed below, seemingly displays the
pharmacological profile of putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors.

possible coinvolvement of 5-ht1b/1d and putative
 xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors in the 5-ht-induced cardiac sympathoinhibition
our suggestion that 5-ht-induced sympatho-inhibition involves the additional participation of a novel mechanism
(probably resembling putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors) is reinforced
when considering that: (i) methiothepin, which displays a high
affinity for recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b and 5-ht1b/1d receptors (see
table 1), was the only antagonist that abolished 5-ht-induced
sympatho-inhibition (compare figures 2 and 4); (ii) gr127935,
which displays a high affinity for 5-ht1b/1d receptors, but low
affinity for recombinant  xxxg1118xxx  receptors (see table 1), abolished the sympatho-inhibition to 5-ct, but not that to 5-ht,
and (iii) 5-ct, methiothepin and ergotamine display a relatively
high affinity for recombinant  xxxg1118xxx  and 5-ht5b receptors in
addition to 5-ht1b/1d receptors (see table 1). consistent with
these findings, figure 3 reveals that the sympatho-inhibitory
potencies of 5-ct and ergotamine (both with high affinities at
5-ht1b/1d and recombinant  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors) were about 2
log units higher than that of cp 93,129, sumatriptan or pnu142633 (selective 5-ht1 receptor agonists) which display low
affinities for  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors (see table 1).

additional evidence in favour of the possible
coinvolvement of putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors
since, as previously pointed out, methiothepin is a nonselective
drug, an attempt was made to cover as much as possible its
spectrum of blockade (except the blockade of putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b
receptors), by studying the effects of the cocktail of drugs (see
experimental protocol) on 5-ht-induced cardiac sympathoinhibition. nevertheless, this response remained un-altered
after the cocktail (figure 4c), a finding which demonstrates that
simultaneous antagonism/inhibition of the above receptors/
mechanisms does not play a role in the antagonism produced by
methiothepin (figure 2b). the fact that this cocktail abolished
the sympatho-inhibition to 5-ct (figure 5c) is attributable to
the dose of gr 127935 present in it (see above). it is to be
highlighted that the doses of these drugs in the cocktail were
high enough to antagonize/inhibit, respectively, a1/2-adreno-

a. sánchez-lópez et al

ceptors (willems et al., 2001a, b), 5-ht1a receptors (villalón
et al., 1998), 5-ht1b/1d receptors (villalón et al., 1996; 1998), 5ht2 receptors (centurión et al., 2002) and cyclooxygenase
(rosenblum & nelson, 1988). obviously, these findings exclude
the involvement of a1/2-adrenoceptors (rand et al., 1987;
boehm & kubista, 2002) and the release of prostanoids
(kokkas & boeynaems, 1988) in our experimental model.

which trigger a rapid neuronal depolarization) receptors is
associated with increases in the cytosolic concentration of
ca2 þ , and a consequent stimulation (rather than inhibition) of
the release of neurotransmitters (rand et al., 1987; boehm &
kubista, 2002).

possible locus of the cardiac sympatho-inhibitory
5-ht1b/1d and putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors

exclusion of the involvement of  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors
despite the above lines of pharmacological evidence, it could
still be argued that  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors may be involved,
as methiothepin (which abolished 5-ht- and 5-ct-induced
sympatho-inhibition; see figures 2b and 5b) displays high
affinity for both receptors (plassat et al., 1993). however, this
seems unlikely, based on: (i) the inactivity of sumatriptan, cp
93,129 and pnu-142633 (as agonists or antagonists) at  xxxg1119xxx 
and 5-ht7 receptors and (ii) the apparent rank order of
agonist potency of 5-ht and 5-ct at  xxxg1119xxx  (5-ht45-ct) and
5-ht7 (5-ctb5-ht) receptors (see hoyer et al., 1994;
villalón et al., 1997).

transductional evidence in favour of the involvement of
5-ht1 and  xxxg1118xxx  receptors
admittedly, our study does not provide direct evidence that
the sympatho-inhibition to 5-ht and the rest of agonists
involves inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. nevertheless, it is
worthy of note that the 5-ht1 receptor subtypes (hoyer et al.,
1994) as well as the  xxxg1118xxx  (carson et al., 1996;
grailhe et al., 2001) are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase
and/or positively coupled to the inwardly rectifying k þ
channel; these are signal transduction systems usually associated with sympatho-inhibition (langer, 1980; rand et al.,
1987; boehm & kubista, 2002). in marked contrast,  xxxg1117xxx ,  xxxg1112xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors are, by definition, positively coupled
to adenylyl cyclase (plassat et al., 1993; hoyer et al., 1994), and
this is associated with sympatho-excitation (langer, 1980;
rand et al., 1987; boehm & kubista, 2002). similarly,
activation of 5-ht2 (positively coupled to phospholipase c)
and 5-ht3 (coupled to ligand-operated na þ /k þ channels

although central mechanisms are not operative in our
experimental model since pithed rats were used, we cannot
exclude an action of 5-ht and related agonists at both the
sympathetic ganglia (see fozard, 1984) and postganglionic
sympathetic neurons (see saxena & villalón, 1990; 1991) which
have modulatory 5-ht receptors. indeed, 5-ht1 receptors may
inhibit the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in rats (5-ht1a
subtype; ireland & jordan, 1987) or cats (5-ht1b/1d subtypes;
jones et al., 1995). with respect to postganglionic sympathetic
neurons, prejunctional  xxxg1110xxx  receptors mediate the inhibition
of noradrenaline release in human atrium (molderings et al.,
1996); in contrast, 5-ht1b receptors mediate this response in rat
vena cava (molderings et al., 1987). admittedly, further studies
in rats will be required to ascertain the functional role of
5-ht1b/1d and putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors on ganglia and
postganglionic sympathetic neurons.
in conclusion, the above results suggest that 5-ht-induced
cardiac sympatho-inhibition in pithed rats is primarily
mediated by two mechanisms, namely: (i) gr 127935-sensitive
5-ht1b/1d receptors and (ii) a novel (methiothepin-sensitive,
but gr 127935-resistant) mechanism most probably involving
putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors. pending the advent of selective
ligands at  xxxg1118xxx /5b receptors, our results would seem to be the
first evidence showing a functional role of putative  xxxg1118xxx /5b
receptors in the peripheral nervous system, contrasting with its
well-established distribution in the central nervous system
(grailhe et al., 2001).
