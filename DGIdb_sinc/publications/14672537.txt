proximal c-terminal domain of sulphonylurea receptor 2a interacts with pore-forming kir6 subunits in katp channels.  functional katp (atp-sensitive potassium) channels are hetero-octamers of four kir6 (inwardly rectifying potassium) channel subunits and four sur (sulphonylurea receptor) subunits. possible interactions between the c-terminal domain of sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx  were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation of rat sur2a c-terminal fragments with full-length  xxxg1250xxx  and by analysis of cloned  xxxg1253xxx  function and distribution in hek-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) in the presence of competing rsur2a fragments. three maltose-binding protein-sur2a fusions, rsur2a-cta (rsur2a residues 1254-1545), rsur2a-ctb (residues 1254-1403) and rsur2a-ctc (residues 1294-1403), were co-immunoprecipitated with full-length  xxxg1250xxx  using a polyclonal anti- xxxg1250xxx  antiserum. a fourth c-terminal domain fragment, rsur2a-ctd (residues 1358-1545) did not co-immunoprecipitate with  xxxg1250xxx  under the same conditions, indicating a direct interaction between  xxxg1250xxx  and a 65-amino-acid section of the cytoplasmic c-terminal region of rsur2a between residues 1294 and 1358. atp- and  xxxd2215xxx -sensitive k+ currents were decreased in hek-293 cells expressing full-length kir6 and  xxxg20xxx  subunits that were transiently transfected with fragments rsur2a-cta, rsur2a-ctc and rsur2a-cte (residues 1294-1359) compared with fragment rsur2a-ctd or mock-transfected cells, suggesting either channel inhibition or a reduction in the number of functional katp channels at the cell surface. anti- xxxg1253xxx  subunit-associated fluorescence in the cell membrane was substantially lower and intracellular fluorescence increased in rsur2a-cte expressing cells; thus, sur2a fragments containing residues 1294-1358 reduce current by decreasing the number of channel subunits in the cell membrane. these results identify a site in the c-terminal domain of rsur2a, between residues 1294 and 1358, whose direct interaction with full-length  xxxg1250xxx  is crucial for the assembly of functional katp channels.
