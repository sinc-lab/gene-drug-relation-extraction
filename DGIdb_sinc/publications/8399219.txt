proteinase k, subtilisin, pronase e, elastase, bactotrypsin, and thermolysin are all shown here
to cleave native mitochondrial creatine kinase from chicken heart ( xxxg470xxx ) very specifically at a single
site, either before or after ala-323. in analogy with hen egg ovalbumin, where the same proteases all
cleaved the polypeptide chain very specifically around ala-352, ala-323 of  xxxg470xxx  may be located in an
exposed surface loop that is sensitive to protease attack. gel permeation chromatography demonstrated
that the two proteolytic fragments of  xxxg470xxx  with mr’s of -37 000 and -6000 remain associated with
each other. proteinase k cleavage did not influence the octamer to dimer ratio of  xxxg470xxx , indicating that
selective cleavage after ala-323 has no direct effect on dimer-dimer interfaces within the octamer. however,
upon addition of mgadp plus creatine and nitrate to induce a transition-state analogue complex of the
enzyme, native  xxxg470xxx  dissociated much more readily into dimers than proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx .
furthermore, proteinase k cleavage of  xxxg470xxx  resulted in 2-1 1-fold decreases in the j“,,values, as well
as in 6-23-fold increases in the k m values for phosphocreatine, creatine, and mgatp, whereas the kd values
for both mgatp and creatine were unaffected. consequently, proteinase k cleavage of  xxxg470xxx  does not
affect substrate binding per se, but interferes with substrate-induced conformational changes which are
essential for catalysis and which mediate the synergism in substrate binding as it is observed with the
unmodified enzyme. together with sequence comparisons and a variety of biochemical and biophysical
similarities between  xxxd35xxx  kinase and ck, the results strongly indicate that ck, like other
phosphotransferases, is a hinge-bending enzyme composed of two domains undergoing conformational
rearrangements upon substrate binding.

creatine kinase (ck) isoenzymes play a crucial role in the
energy metabolism of tissues with high and fluctuating energy
demands like heart, brain, skeletal muscle, spermatozoa, and
retina [for reviews, see wallimann et al. (1992) and wyss et
al. (1992)]. the three cytosolic ck isoenzymes are dimeric
molecules composed of two types of subunits (mm-ck, mbck, and bb-ck, m standing for the “muscle” isoform, and
b standing for the “brain” isoform). in contrast, the two
mi-ck isoenzymes (mi,-ck from brain and  xxxg470xxx  from
heart) have the unique property of forming dimeric as well
as octamericmolecules which, dependingon ph, ionic strength,
protein and substrate concentrations, and other factors, are
readily interconvertible. electron microscopy revealed that
the octameric mi-ck molecules are highly ordered, cube-like
structures displaying a 4-fold symmetry, a side length of

approx. 10 nm, and a central cavity or channel. however, the
crystal structure is still unsolved, even though a number of
groups reported on the crystallization of ck isoenzymes and
on preliminary x-ray data [for references, see schnyder et al.
(1991)l.
a fundamental property of kinases in general is that, in the
transition state of the reaction, water has to be excluded from
the surroundings of the bound substrates in order to avoid
hydrolysis of the phosphoryl compounds and concomitant
energy dissipation. in kinases for which the three-dimensional
structure is already known [e.g., adenylate kinase, hexokinase,
and  xxxd35xxx  kinase; see anderson et al. (1979),
harlosetal. (1992),andgersteinet al. (1993)],thisisachieved
by an induced-fit mechanism of enzyme action (koshland &
neet, 1968). the substrate binding sites of these enzymes
are located on neighboring domains which, in the absence of
substrates, are separated by a deep cleft. substrate binding
induces a movement of the domains relative to each other,
resulting in a catalysis-competent orientationof the substrates,
in the closure of the cleft between the two domains, and thus
in theexclusionofwater from the transition stateof the enzyme.
for a variety of proteins that were or still are difficult to
crystallize (e.g., actin, myosin, dynein, or kinesin), limited
proteolysis proved to be a powerful tool to study structurefunction relationships [mornet et al., 1984; mocz et al., 1988;
for reviews, see hambly et al. (1986), vale (1990), and vibert
and cohen (1988)l. limited proteolysis of ck isoenzymes,
however, has been described in just a few studies, and most
of them were performed with proteinase k. this latter serine
protease was shown to selectively “nick” the cytosolic ck
isoenzymes, without dissociation of the two proteolytic
fragments, and to cause a very pronounced or even complete

inactivation of the enzymes (williamson et al., 1977; price et
al., 1981; lough et al., 1985; morris et al., 1985; lebherz et
al., 1986). in the present investigation, limited proteolysis of
chicken  xxxg470xxx  was used to obtain new insights into (i) the
structural organization of ck protomers and of octameric
mi-ck molecules, (ii) the relationships between substrateinduced conformational changes of  xxxg470xxx  and (reversible)
dimer-octamer interconversions, and (iii) the mechanism of
enzyme action. the results obtained strongly suggest that
ck is a hinge-bending enzyme similar to  xxxd35xxx 
kinase.

materials and methods
materials. chicken  xxxg470xxx  was purified as described
previously (schlegel et al., 1988), either from chicken heart
or from escherichia coli strains overexpressing this protein
(furter et al., 1992).  xxxg470xxx  from both sources did not
display any qualitativeor quantitativedifferences. al-5 mibck and c278s  xxxg470xxx  were kindly provided by p. kaldis
and r. furter, respectively. chicken bb-ck was purified
according to quest et ai. (1989). hen egg ovalbumin was
obtained from pharmacia (dubendorf, switzerland); subtilisin
and pmsf, from serva (catalys sa, wallisellen, switzerland); bactotrypsin (porcine pancreas), from difco (chemie
brunschwig ag, basel, switzerland); pcr, from calbiochem
(lucerne, switzerland); pronase e, from merck (auer
bittmann souli6 ag, basel, switzerland); lobster tail muscle
arginine kinase and cr, from sigma (buchs, switzerland);
and adp, atp, proteinase k, elastase (porcine pancreas),
trypsin (bovine pancreas), thermolysin, chymotrypsin a4
(bovinepancreas), and yeast  xxxd35xxx  kinase, from
boehringer mannheim (rotkreuz, switzerland). all other
chemicals were at least of reagent grade. before the
experiments,  xxxg470xxx , bb-ck, arginine kinase, and pgk were
extensively dialyzed against the appropriate buffers.
proteolysis experiments. in experiments with trypsin and
bactotrypsin, the concentration of chicken  xxxg470xxx , chicken
bb-ck, hen egg ovalbumin, or lobster arginine kinase was
chosen to be 0.3 mg/ml, and with all other proteases, 1 mg/
ml. experiments with proteinase k, subtilisin, pronase e,
elastase, and chymotrypsin a4 were performed in buffer a
(50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm nacl, 0.2 mm na2edta, 1 mm nan3, and 0.5 mm  xxxd26xxx ), ph 9.0; experiments
with trypsin and bactotrypsin, in buffer b (0.2 m sodium
phosphate and 0.5 mm  xxxd26xxx , ph 7.0); and experiments with
thermolysin, in buffer c (50 mm tris, 10 mm cac12, and 0.5
mm  xxxd26xxx , ph 8.0). after a 10-min preincubation of the
samples at 30 oc, proteinase k (1:4000 w/w), subtilisin
(l:loo), pronase e (1:50-60), elastase (l:loo), bactotrypsin
(l:lo), thermolysin (1:90), trypsin (l:lo), or chymotrypsin
(1:lo) was added and the incubations were continued for the
indicated periods of time at 30 oc. in experiments with
proteinase k, subtilisin, pronase e, trypsin, and chymotrypsin,
proteolysis was stopped by addition of an equivalent volume
of solution d (5 mm pmsf in 20% ethanol) and a further
10-minincubation at 30 “c. these samples were subsequently
used either for measurements of enzymatic activity by the
ph-stat method (see below), for sds-page (laemmli,
1970), or for tricine-sds-page (schagger & von jagow,
1987). control experiments demonstrated that pmsf at a
final concentration of 2.5 mm completely inhibited proteolysis.
in experiments with elastase, bactotrypsin, and thermolysin,
proteolysis was stopped by directly transferring the samples
into boiling sds-page sample buffer. the extent of cleavage
of  xxxg470xxx  was quantified either by activity measurements or

wyss et al.
by densitometric scanning of 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels
with a shimadzu cs-930 scanner. apparent first-order rate
constants of cleavage of  xxxg470xxx  were calculated from the
slopes of semilogarithmic plots (see figure 2) derived from
proteolysis time-course experiments (for example, figure 1).
gel filtration experiments. gel permeation chromatography on a superose 12hr 10/30column (fplc,pharmacia)
was used for the determination of the octamer to dimer ratio
of  xxxg470xxx . buffer a (containing 2 mm  xxxd26xxx ), ph 7.2,
served as elution buffer. to investigate the equilibrium
octamer to dimer ratio at  xxxg470xxx  concentrations higher than
0.5 mg/ml (figure 4), both uncleaved and proteinase
k-digested  xxxg470xxx  were concentrated by centricon 10
microconcentrators (amicon). for  xxxg470xxx  concentrations
below 0.5 mg/ml, uncleaved and “nicked”  xxxg470xxx  were
diluted by a 1:l mixture of buffer a, ph 9.0, and solution d.
control experiments demonstrated that, under these conditions, equilibration between dimeric and octameric  xxxg470xxx 
rapidly occurs. before gel permeation chromatography, all
samples were dialyzed against buffer a (containing 2 mm
 xxxd26xxx ), ph 7.2, and the protein concentrations were subsequently determined according to bradford (1976).
kinetic measurements. the enzymatic activity of mibck was measured by the ph-stat method. one international
unit (iu) corresponds to 1 pmol of pcr or atp transphosphorylated/min at 25 oc and ph 7.00 or 8.00, respectively.
under standard conditions,  xxxg470xxx  activity was determined
in the direction of atp synthesisin an assay mixture containing
65 mm kcl, 8.5 mm mgc12,85pm egta, 4 mm adp, and
10 mm pcr, ph 7.00. as titrant, 20 mm hcl was used. for
the determination of k, (pcr) and vmax in the direction of
atp synthesis, [pcr] was varied from 0.5 to 30 mm, while
[adp] and [mg2+] were held constant at 4 and 5 mm,
respectively.
activity measurements in the direction of pcr synthesis
were performed in an assay mixture containing 65 mm kcl,
85 p m egta, and mgcl2 at ph 8.00, with [mg2+]always
exceeding [atp] by 1 mm; 20 mm naoh was used as titrant.
for the determination of the kd and k m values for both mgatp
and cr as well as of the v,ax value in the direction of pcr
synthesis, six different mgatp concentrations (1.2, 1.7,2.5,
3.5, 5, and 8 mm) were used, each at four different cr
concentrations (35,50,65,and 100mm). allkineticconstants
were determined by initial velocity measurementsand analyzed
using the program package written by cleland (1979) as
adapted for personal computers by r. viola (akron university,
akron, oh). the values are given as mean f se.
other methods. for n-terminal amino acid sequencing,
sds- and tricine-sds-polyacrylamide gels were directly
semi-dry-blotted at a constant current of 1 ma/cm* for 105
min onto poly(viny1 difluoride) (pvdf) membranes (immobilon-psq; millipore ag, volketswil, switzerland). automated edman degradation was done on an applied biosystems
470a sequencer with on-line microbore phenylthiohydantoin
detection. protein concentrations were determined by the
method of bradford (1976) using the bio-rad reagent and
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
in order to investigate whether limited proteolysis of mibck is paralleled by a transition from a stressed to a relaxed
conformation as was previously shown for certain members
of the  xxxg745xxx  inhibitor superfamily (pemberton et al.,
1988), uncleaved as well as proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx 
(0.1 mg/ml) was incubated in buffer a (containing 2 mm
 xxxd26xxx ), ph 7.2, for 1 h at temperatures ranging from 30 to
90 oc. denatured  xxxg470xxx  was subsequently pelleted by

results
time course of proteolysis of  xxxg470xxx  and arginine
kinase. chicken  xxxg470xxx  was selectively cleaved (nicked) by
proteinase k (1:4000, w/w) in a time-dependent manner
(figure la), resulting in two fragments with apparent m,'s
of 36 700 and -6400; the latter is only visible on tricinesds-polyacrylamide gels (see the band marked by a star in
figure 3b). likewise, lobster tail muscle arginine kinase was
selectivelyand time-dependentlycleaved by pronase e (figure
1b), resulting in two fragments with apparent m,'s of 36 100
and -4500. the lack of additional minor degradation bands
suggests that cleavage in both cases is highly specific and
that, after scission of the sensitive peptide bond, no additional
cleavagesites become available to the proteases, even though
proteinase k and pronase e are in general rather unspecific
proteases.

of  xxxg470xxx . chicken  xxxg470xxx  (1 mg/ml) wasdigestedwith proteinase
k for the indicated periods of time as described under materials and
methods either in the absence ( 0 )or in the presence of the following
ligands: (a)20 mm pcr; (w) 4 mm adp and 5 mm mgc12; or (a)
4 mm adp, 5 mm mgc12,20 mm cr, and 50 mm kno3. proteolysis
of  xxxg470xxx  was followed by sds-page and densitometricscanning
of the lanes. [a] represents the concentration of native, undigested
 xxxg470xxx  and is given in p m . from the semilogarithmic plot, the
following apparent first-order rate constants were calculated (mean
f sd; n = 3): without competitor, (8.43 f 0.39) x lo" s-i; 20 mm
pcr, (8.83 f 0.55) x lo" s-l; 4 mm adp and 5 mm mgc12, (6.82
f 0.25) x lo" s-i; 4 mm adp, 5 mm mgc12,20 mm cr, and 50
mm kn03, (2.05 f 0.10) x lo" s-i. when cleavageof  xxxg470xxx  was
followed by measurements of enzymatic activity, a plot very similar
to the one shown here was obtained only under the assumption that
fully digested  xxxg470xxx  under the standard ph-stat conditionsretains
16% of the enzymatic activity of the undigested enzyme.

in similar time-course experiments,  xxxg470xxx  was digested
with proteinase k in the presence of various substrates and
was subsequently analyzed by sds-page (not shown). the
concentration of native, uncleaved  xxxg470xxx  was calculated
from densitometric scanning of the respective sds-page
lanes. plotting these values against time (figure 2) allowed
the determination of apparent first-order rate constants of
proteinase k cleavageof  xxxg470xxx  and thus also the quantitation
of the effect of substrates on the cleavage rate. similarly to
previous experiments on rabbit mm-ck (williamson et al.,
1977), the rate of proteinase k cleavage of  xxxg470xxx  was not
influenced by 20 mm pcr, whereas it was decreased 20% by
4 mm adp plus 5 mm mgc12, or even 75% by formation of
a transition-state analogue complex of  xxxg470xxx  ( xxxg470xxx , 4
mm adp, 5 mm mgc12, 20 mm cr, and 50 mm nitrate).
under all conditionstested, proteinase k cleavageof  xxxg470xxx 
proved to be a monophasic process, in contrast to previously
published, weak evidence suggesting that formation of a
transition-state analogue complex of rabbit mm-ck results
in biphasic degradation and inactivation by proteinase k
(williamson et al., 1977).
limited proteolysis of mib- ck with various proteases:
location of the cleavagesiteand effect on the overall threedimensional structure. since it was surprising that  xxxg470xxx 
and arginine kinase were cleaved by nonspecific proteases
(proteinase k and pronase e, respectively) at a single site, a
number of other proteases were examined. limited proteolysis
of native  xxxg470xxx  by proteinase k, subtilisin, pronase e,
elastase, bactotrypsin, and thermolysin resulted in highly
selective cleavage of the polypeptide chain (figure 3a,b).
each of these proteases produced only two fragments which
showed seemingly identical gel migration patterns, indicating
that  xxxg470xxx  contains a single site that is hypersensitive to
protease attack. this conclusion was corroborated by nterminal sequencing of all fragments (table i), proving that

either by sds-page (a,c) or by tricinesds-page (b,d). note that all six proteases apparently generated the same two fragments. the
small fragment is only visible on tricinesds-polyacrylamide gels and is marked by a star. the band labeled by an arrow in panel a is due
to the combination of cleavage at the protease-hypersensitive site and removal of the first six n-terminal amino acids (see the text). the

limited proteolysisof chicken  xxxg470xxx , chicken bb-ck, lobster argininekinase, and hen egg ovalbumin was performed as described under materials
and methods. a superose 12 gel filtration column (fplc, pharmacia) was used to determine the elution volumes of octamers and dimers of both
uncleaved and "nicked"  xxxg470xxx . amino-terminal sequencing of the proteolytic fragments of  xxxg470xxx  and ovalbumin revealed that the proteins were
nicked by all six proteases at a single site. the amino terminus of  xxxg470xxx  deduced from the cdna sequence (hossle et al., 1988). amino-terminal
sequencing of the small proteolytic fragment of thermolysin-digested  xxxg470xxx  revealed two species. the peptide with the upper amino terminus
represented approx. 2/3, and that with the lower one approx. 1/3, of the sample. the amino termini of both the native arginine kinase and the large
proteolytic fragment thereof were blocked.

proteinase k, subtilisin, pronase e, elastase, and bactotrypsin
cleave  xxxg470xxx  between ala-323 and ala-324. limited
proteolysis by thermolysin is an exception to the rule, in as
far as the major cleavagesite was identified between thr-322
and ala-323. in addition, n-terminal sequencingof the band
marked by an arrow in figure 3a [(kl)fpp(s)a] revealed
that the satellite bands of both the native, uncleaved protein
and the large fragmentsof pronase e- and bactotrypsin-treated
 xxxg470xxx  (figure 3a, lanes 4 and 6) are likely due to

(additional) cleavage at the very n-terminus, in accordance
with proteinase lys-c experiments on chicken  xxxg470xxx  that
resulted in very selective removal of the first five amino acids
(kaldis et al., 1993).
chicken bb-ck was selectively cleaved by proteinase k
between ala-328 and ala-329, and lobster arginine kinase
was selectively cleaved by pronase e between glu-316 and
ala-3 17 [figure 3a,b, lanes 8 and 9; amino acid numbering
is deduced from the respective cdna sequences (hossle et

al., 1988; dumas & camonis, 1993)l. these cleavage sites
coincide in location within the primary structure exactly with
the protease-hypersensitivesite of  xxxg470xxx . since in addition
native rabbit mm-ck, chicken mm-ck, and chicken bbck were previously shown to be selectively cleaved by
proteinase k and pronase e (williamson et al., 1977; price
et al., 1981; lough et al., 1985; morris et al., 1985; lebherz
et al., 1986), these data indicate that a protease-hypersensitive
site may be a general phenomenon of all  xxxd1759xxx  kinases.
in contrast to the results presented so far, native  xxxg470xxx 
proved to be highly resistant to (pure) trypsin and chymotrypsin
a4,even at highconcentrationsof these proteases (l:lo, w/w),
thus corroborating previous studies which also revealed that
ck is resistant to trypsin digestion (price & stevens, 1982;
morris, 1989). these findings may be explained by the lack
of basic and aromatic residues in close proximity to ala-323.
native lobster arginine kinase was insensitive to digestion by
both proteinase k and trypsin (not shown).
gel permeation chromatography did not reveal any shifts
in the elution positions of  xxxg470xxx  with any of the proteases
(table i). in addition, upon selective cleavage of the  xxxg470xxx 
polypeptidechain either before or after ala-323, no additional
sites became susceptible to proteolytic attack (figure 3a,b),
suggesting that the overall three-dimensional structure of mibck is not affected by limited proteolysis (see also discussion).
the same holds true for proteinase k-digested rabbit mmck, where native page, gel permeation chromatography,
and cross-linking experiments also revealed no dissociation of
the fragments under non-denaturing conditions (williamson
et al., 1977; price et al., 1981).
comparison with ovalbumin. a specificity in protein
cleavage analogous to the one observed for  xxxg470xxx  (figure
3a,b) was also found for hen egg ovalbumin (figure 3c,d).
the same six proteases as in the case of  xxxg470xxx  selectively
cleaved ovalbumin at a single site, either between ala-352
andser-353 or betweenasp350andala-351 (tablei). these
findings agree with previous investigations showing that
subtilisin bpn', elastase, thermolysin, and bromelain cleave
ovalbumin at a single site, and that the cleavage site for both
elastase- and subtilisin bpn'-digestion is located between ala352 and ser-353 (wright, 1984).
ovalbumin (385 amino acids, mr 42 750) belongs to the
 xxxg745xxx  inhibitor (serpin) superfamily,all the members
of which are selectively cleaved near the c-terminus by a
variety of proteases. upon limited proteolysis, the "real" serine
protease inhibitors (al-antitrypsin, antithrombin,etc.) undergo
a transition from a native, stressed (s)to a relaxed (r)
conformation that is associated with a considerable increase
in thermal stability (pemberton et al., 1988). ovalbumin
and  xxxg99xxx , however, which display no protease
inhibitor activity, lack such a pronounced conformational
rearrangement (stein et al., 1989). x-ray crystallography
and biochemical experiments on ovalbumin, al-antitrypsin,
and other serpins have shown that, upon selective "nicking"
of the polypeptide chain, the two proteolytic fragments, as in
 xxxg470xxx , remain associated with each other and that the
protease-hypersensitivesite is located in an exposed loop on
the surface of the molecule (wright, 1984; pemberton et al.,
1988; huber & carrell, 1989; wright et al., 1990). since in
addition the amino acid sequence around ala-323 of  xxxg470xxx 
displays considerablesimilarity to the protease-hypersensitive
stretch of ovalbumin and other serpins (not shown), it is
tempting to postulate that ala-323 of  xxxg470xxx  is also part of
an exposed surface loop that is easily accessible to proteases.

were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography.
proteinase k cleavage and the octamer to dimer ratio

of mib- ck. compared to the cytosolicck isoenzymes mm-,
mb-, and bb-ck which exclusively form dimeric molecules,
the mitochondrial ck isoenzymes have the unique property
of forming both dimeric and octameric molecules [for a review,
see wyss et al. (1992)l. the two oligomeric forms are readily
interconvertible, depending on mi-ck concentration, salt
concentrations, ph, and other conditions. for example,
formation of a transition-state analogue complex of  xxxg470xxx 
(0.1 mg/ml in buffer a, ph 7.2) with mgadp, cr, and
nitrate (where the latter simulatesthe transferable phosphoryl
group in the transition state of the reaction) results in rapid
and almost complete dissociation of the octamers into dimers.
under in vivo conditions, however, mi-ck is thought to be
predominantly octameric.
as already stated above, selective nicking of the  xxxg470xxx 
polypeptide chain by six different proteases did not influence
the elution positions of dimeric and octameric  xxxg470xxx  from
a gel filtration column (table i). furthermore, in the absence
of substrates, uncleaved and proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx 
displayed indistinguishable dependencies of the octamer to
dimer ratio on the  xxxg470xxx  concentration (figure 4), thus
corroborating that, under these conditions, limited proteolysis
affects neither the overall three-dimensionalstructure nor the
dimer-dimer interfaces within the octamer.
in order to compare the cleavage rates of octameric and
dimeric  xxxg470xxx , octameric wild-type  xxxg470xxx  (87% octamers), dimeric wild-type  xxxg470xxx  (89% dimers), octameric
al-5  xxxg470xxx  (85% octamers; al-5  xxxg470xxx  is a mutant
expressed in e. coli that lacks the first five amino acids and
displays a decreased octamer stability, but has normal kinetic
properties), and dimeric al-5  xxxg470xxx  (93% dimers) were
digested with proteinase k (1:1150, w/w) at a concentration
of 0.1 mg/ml in buffer a, ph 7.2, for various periods of time.
control gel filtration runs demonstrated that during the
experiment the proportion of octamers and dimers in any case
changed only little. sds-page showed that dimeric and
octameric  xxxg470xxx  were selectivelycleaved at the same single
site (not shown). together with the indistinguishablecleavage

5: effect of proteinase k cleavage on substrate-induced
dissociation of  xxxg470xxx  octamers. chicken  xxxg470xxx  (1 mg/ml) was
digested with proteinase k for 90 min as described under materials
and methods. control (uncleaved)  xxxg470xxx  was treated identically,
exceptthat proteinasek wasomitted from the incubation.both native,
uncleaved ( 0 )and proteinase k-digested ( 0 )mib-ckwere incubated
for 24 h at 4 oc in buffer a (containing 2 mm  xxxd26xxx ), ph 7.2, with
the respective concentrations of substrates. 1x tsac (transitionstate analogue complex inducing substrates) corresponds to 4 mm
adp, 20 mm cr, and 50 mm nitrate. [mg2+]alwaysexceeded [adp]
by 1 mm. at the end of the incubation, the proportion of  xxxg470xxx 
octamers was determined by gel permeation chromatography.
f 0.28) x lo4, and (3.77 f 0.10) x lo" s-l, respectively;

mean f sd; n = 31, this suggests that formation of octamers
out of  xxxg470xxx  dimers does not impose steric constraints on
the accessibility of the protease-hypersensitive stretch for
proteinase k. inother words, the cleavage site is exposed on
the surface in both  xxxg470xxx  dimers and octamers.
a different picture emerges in the presence of substrates.
when  xxxg470xxx  was incubated for 24 h at 4 oc with increasing
concentrations of the transition-state analogue complex
inducing substrates (mgadp, cr and nitrate), native, uncleaved  xxxg470xxx  proved to be much more sensitive to the
substrates and more readily dissociated into dimers than
proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  (figure 5 ) . therefore, proteinase k cleavage may either affect substrate binding itself
or prevent substrate-induced conformational changes which
lead to destabilization of the  xxxg470xxx  octamers.
effect of proteinase k cleavage on the kinetic properties
of mib- ck. activity measurements under standard ph-stat
conditions revealed that limited proteolysis of chicken mibck is paralleled by a pronounced inactivation of the enzyme.
as can be seen in figure 6, degradation and inactivation of
 xxxg470xxx  by proteinase k were almost linearly related.
extrapolation to zero concentration of uncleaved enzyme
indicates that quantitatively nicked  xxxg470xxx  under these
experimental conditions retained approx. 16% of the original
enzymatic activity, thus contrasting with previous investigations on rabbit mm-ck, chicken mm-ck, and chicken bbck where proteinase k cleavage was paralleled by complete
or almost complete inactivation of the enzyme (williamson
et al., 1977; lough et al., 1985; lebherz et al., 1986; morris,
1989).
more extensive kinetic analysis (table 11) showed that the
kd values of proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  for both mgatp
and cr were virtually indistinguishable from the kd values of
native, uncleaved  xxxg470xxx  (furter et al., 1993). this indicates
that substrate binding per se is not influenced by proteinase

figure
6: correlation between degradationof  xxxg470xxx  by proteinase
k and loss of enzymatic activity. chicken  xxxg470xxx  (1 mg/ml) was
digested with proteinase k for the indicated periods of time as
described under materials and methods. after addition of pmsf to
irreversibly inactivate proteinase k, the samples were used both for
measurements of enzymatic activity and for sds-page. in the
latter case, the concentration of undigested  xxxg470xxx  ([a]) was
determined by densitometric scanning of 10%sds-polyacrylamide
gels stained with serva blue r (see figure 1a).
k cleavage, in general agreement with the data of price et al.
(1981) who found that, in the absence of other substrates,
native and proteinase k-digested rabbit mm-ck have the
same affinity for adp. binding of  xxxd2531xxx to  xxxg470xxx  was also
not affected by proteinase kcleavage (not shown). in contrast,
proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  displayed 11- and 2-folddecreased vmax values in the direction of pcr synthesis and
atp synthesis, respectively, as well as a 6-fold-increased
k,(cr), a 6-fold-increased km(mgatp), and a 23-foldincreased km(pcr) compared to native, uncleaved  xxxg470xxx .
consequently, the km values of proteinase k-digested mibck for both mgatp and cr were higher than the respective
kd values, whereas the opposite is true for uncleaved  xxxg470xxx 
(furter et al., 1993).
to conclude, these results demonstrate that proteinase k
cleavage of  xxxg470xxx  prevents synergism in substrate binding.
such synergism has been observed for all native ckisoenzymes
investigated so far [morrison & james, 1965; for reviews, see
kenyon and reed (1983), seraydarian and vial (1986), and
furter et al. (1993)l. most likely, proteinase k cleavage
impedes substrate-induced conformational changes which
facilitate binding of the second substrate. in addition, these
substrate-induced conformational changes obviously destabilize the octameric  xxxg470xxx  molecules, resulting in facilitated
dissociation of the latter into dimers (figure 5 ) .

discussion
mitochondrial creatine kinase from chicken heart (mibck) was shown in the present investigation to be selectively
cleaved by six different proteases, resulting in only two
fragments with m,'s of 36 700 and 6400 (figure 3). with all
of these proteases (proteinase k, subtilisin, pronase e, elastase,
bactotrypsin, and thermolysin), cleavage occurred either before
or after ala-323 (table i). several lines of evidence indicate
that the overall three-dimensional structure of  xxxg470xxx  is not
or is only minimally affected by limited proteolysis. both
uncleaved and nicked  xxxg470xxx  form dimeric as well as
octameric molecules. moreover, the dependence of the
proportion of octamers on the  xxxg470xxx  concentration is
indistinguishable for uncleaved and nicked  xxxg470xxx  (figure
4). consequently, limited proteolysis neither directly nor

kinetic experiments and calculations of k,, &,and v,,values were performed as described under materials and methods. for the determination
of k,(pcr) and v,,, in the direction of atp synthesis, [pcr] was varied from 0.5 to 30 mm, while [adp] and [mgz+]were held constant at 4 and
5 mm, respectively. for the determinationof the k, and &values for both mgatp and cr, as well as of the v-value in the directionof pcr synthesis,
initial velocity measurements were performed at 1.2,1.7,2.5,3.5, 5,or 8 mm mgatp and at either 35, 50,65,or 100 mm cr. each value is based
on 30-66 individual activity measurements and is given as mean h se. data from furter et al. (1993).

indirectly affects the dimer-dimer interfaces within the
octamer, at least in the absenceof substrates. gel permeation
chromatography revealed that the elution positions of both
 xxxg470xxx  octamers and dimers are not influenced by limited
proteolysis (table i). this finding suggests that the overall
shape of the molecule (stokes radius) is conserved and that
the two fragments generated by selective cleavage of the
polypeptide chain remain associated with each other. furthermore, the far-uv cd spectra of native, uncleaved mibck and of proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  were almost identical
(m. gross, personal communication), thus indicating no
significant change in secondary structure elements. finally,
uncleaved and proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  were shown to
be equally sensitive to temperature denaturation (not shown;
this experiment is described under materials and methods).
a comparison with ovalbumin, a member of the serine
protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, may give a hint about
the location of the protease-hypersensitive region in the threedimensional structureof  xxxg470xxx . ovalbumin has been shown
previously to be selectively cleaved near ala-352 by a variety
of proteases (wright, 1984). x-ray crystallography revealed
that this cleavage site is located in an exposed loop on the
surface of the molecule and that the two proteolytic fragments
remain associated with each other (wright et al., 1990). in
the present investigation, both  xxxg470xxx  and ovalbumin were
selectively cleaved by the same six proteases (figure 3; table
i), whereas they were highly resistant to trypsin digestion
[not shown; see also wright (1984)l. furthermore, the
protease-hypersensitive stretches of  xxxg470xxx  on one hand and
of ovalbumin and other serpins on the other hand display
some sequence homology (not shown), indicating that ala323 of  xxxg470xxx  may also be part of an exposed, probably
rather flexible surface loop.
several lines of evidence suggest that this inferred surface
loop overlaps neither with monomer-monomer interfaces
within the dimer nor with dimer-dimer interfaces within the
octamer.  xxxg470xxx  dimers are very stable and, like the dimeric
cytosolic ck isoenzymes, can only be dissociated into
monomers by denaturing agents. accordingly, in all gel
filtration experiments, no indication at all for a decay of mibck octamers and dimers into monomers was observed (not
shown), making it highly unlikely that the protease-hypersensitive site is located at monomer-monomer interfaces.
furthermore, dimeric and octameric  xxxg470xxx  were selectively
cleaved by proteinase k at the same single site (not shown),
and the cleavage rates were not significantly different for
octameric and dimeric  xxxg470xxx  molecules. finally, the
octamer to dimer ratio of  xxxg470xxx  was not influenced by
proteinase k cleavage (figure 4).
despite the lack of effects on the overall structure, limited
proteolysis drastically affected the kinetic properties of mibck (figure 6; table 11). proteinase k cleavage considerably
decreased the v,,, values in both directions of the reaction
catalyzed by  xxxg470xxx  and substantially increased the kmvalues

for mgatp, cr, and pcr. the kd values for both mgatp
and cr, however, were unchanged. as a result, the kmvalues
of proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  for these latter two substrates
were higher than the respectivekd values, whereas the opposite
is true for native, uncleaved  xxxg470xxx  (furter et al., 1993).
consequently, proteinase k digestion abolishes synergism in
substrate binding as it is observed for native  xxxg470xxx . avariety
of previous studies, using epr, nmr, and fluorescence
spectroscopy as well as experiments on the protection by
substrates frommodification and/or inactivation by alkylating
agents, have implicated that substrate binding results in
conformational changes of the ck molecules, and that these
substrate-induced conformational changes are essential for
catalytic activity and for synergism in substrate binding (cohn,
1970; milner-white & watts, 1971; quiocho & olson, 1974;
haugland, 1975; mclaughlin et al., 1976; milner-white &
kelly, 1976; markhamet al., 1977; keighren & price, 1978).
therefore, the loss of synergism in substrate binding observed
for proteinase k-digested  xxxg470xxx  may reflect the inability
of the nicked enzyme to undergo substrate-induced conformational changes. this interpretation is favored by two
additional lines of evidence: (i) the presence of conformational
substates of  xxxg470xxx  was corroborated in the present investigation by the findingofa 75% reductionin the rateof selective
cleavage of the  xxxg470xxx  polypeptide chain by proteinase k
upon formation of a transition-state analogue complex of the
enzyme (figure 2). (ii) it has been suggested previously that
substrate-induced conformational changes result in dissociation of mi-ck octamers into dimers [marcillat et al., 1987;
see also wyss et al. (1992)l. accordingly, for proteinase
k-digested  xxxg470xxx  relative to native  xxxg470xxx , much higher
concentrations of substrates were needed to induce octamer
dissociation (figure 5 ) .
recent low-resolution maps of chicken  xxxg470xxx  (t. schnyder and w. kabsch, personal communication) and lobster
arginine kinase (c. dumas and j. janin, personal communication) may give a hint about the mechanism of the
conformational changes induced by substrates. they clearly
showed that the protomers of both  xxxd1759xxx  kinases are
composed of two domains separated by a cleft, a conclusion
that is corroborated by limited proteolysis experiments on
(re)folding intermediates of chicken mm-ck that were
indicative of two domains with mr's of 20 000 and 23 000
(morris & cartwright, 1990; morris & jackson, 1991). this
three-dimensional organization is reminiscent of the structure
of other phosphokinases, like hexokinase, adenylate kinase,
or  xxxd35xxx  kinase (anderson et al., 1979; watson
et al., 1982; gerstein et al., 1993; see also figure 7). for
these three enzymes, x-ray crystallography, small angle x-ray
scattering, nmr, and sedimentation experiments revealed
that substrate binding induces a relatively large movement of
the two domains relative to each other, thereby resulting in
the closure of the cleft between the domains (tanswell et al.,
1976; anderson et al., 1979; pickover et al., 1979; roustan

(1 982) with kind permission of oxford university press, england.
et al., 1980; sinev et al., 1989; harlos et al., 1992; gerstein
et al., 1993). since the two substrate binding sites in all three
cases are located on opposite sides of the cleft (for example,
see figure 7), substrate-induced closure of the latter was
suggested to bring the two substrates together, in order to
allow a direct in-line transfer of a phosphoryl group and to
discriminate against water as a substrate, thus avoiding
hydrolysisof the substrates and concomitantenergy dissipation.
in accordancewith these results, small angle x-ray scattering
of lobster arginine kinase revealed that the radius of gyration
decreases by 1.20 f 0.25 a upon binding of mgadp and
arginine, thus comparing reasonably well with the substrateinduced decreases in the radii of gyration of hexokinase and
3-phosphoglyceratekinase of 0.95 f 0.24 and 1.09 f 0.34 a,
respectively (dumas & janin, 1983). in addition, epr spectra
of rabbit mm-ck revealed that, upon formation of a
transition-state analogue complex of the enzyme (mm-ck,
mnadp, cr, and nitrate), all the water molecules were
removed from the first coordination sphereof the paramagnetic
mn2+ ion (reed & cohn, 1972).
as evidenced by a variety of structural, biochemical, and
kinetic parallelisms (preliminary low-resolution maps, sizes
of the domains, susceptibility of the domains to denaturation,
reaction mechanism, effect of anions on catalytic activity,
effect of substrates on the enzyme’s conformation,and others),
ck and arginine kinase seem to resemble most pronouncedly,
among the phosphokinases for which the three-dimensional
structure is known, 3-phosphoglyceratekinase (pgk; figure
7), a monomeric enzyme with approx. 415 amino acids that
is involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. most importantly, the primary sequences of ck and pgk can be aligned
reasonably well, especially in the c-terminal halves of the
molecules (not shown). the highest degree of homology was
found between residues 177-206 of  xxxg470xxx  and residues 2 15241 of yeast pgk (correspondingto helix vi, &strand h, and
part of helix vi1 in figure 7). in addition, residues 301-341
of  xxxg470xxx  obviously correspond to residues 343-384 of pgk
(helices xi and xi1 and &strand m). as a matter of fact,
these secondary structure elements make up a large part of
the adenine nucleotide binding site of pgk and are therefore
most likely to share homology with ck sequences. according
to this sequence alignment, the protease-hypersensitivesite of

 xxxg470xxx  (ala-323) would be part of the atp binding domain
and would correspond to a residue near &strand m of pgk
(figure 7; shown in black) which is in close spatial proximity
to the hinge region of the molecule. this structural comparison
serves as a “feedback control” for the interpretation of the
results presented in this investigation, in as far as disturbances
of the hinge region of  xxxg470xxx  exerted by proteinasek cleavage
may explain quite well the observed loss of synergism in
substrate binding and of substrate-induced conformational
changes.
in conclusion, the present study has shown that  xxxd1759xxx 
kinases in general and chicken  xxxg470xxx  in particular have a
protease-hypersensitive site which, in  xxxg470xxx , is located most
probably in a loop that is exposed on the surface of both
octameric and dimeric molecules. selective cleavage of the
 xxxg470xxx  polypeptide chain at this site, le., after ala-323,
interferes with substrate-inducedconformationalchangesand
thus prevents synergism in substrate binding as it is observed
for native, uncleaved  xxxg470xxx . in addition, the vmax values
are decreased while substrate binding per se is not influenced
by limited proteolysis. from a comparison with  xxxd35xxx  kinase, it is suggested that ck protomers are
composed of two domains separated by a cleft and that selective
cleavageof  xxxg470xxx  after ala-323 interferes with a substrateinduced hinge motion of the two domains relative to each
other, thereby impeding closure of the cleft.
chemical modification (cohn, 1970; maggio et al., 1977;
markham et al., 1977; keighren & price, 1978) and sitedirected mutagenesis (furter et al., 1993)of the highly reactive
sulfhydryl group of ck (cys-278 in chicken  xxxg470xxx ) were
also shown to result in markedly decreased vmax values, in a
decreased ability to undergo substrate-inducedconformational
changes, and in loss of synergism in substrate binding. a
similar mechanism of action of proteinase k cleavage on one
hand and of manipulations of the highly reactive sulfhydryl
group on the other hand is further suggested by the finding
that proteinase k cleavage, site-directed mutagenesisof cys278 to a ser residue, and reversible modification of cys-278
by  xxxd2811xxx  all impede substrate-induced dissociation of  xxxg470xxx  octamers into dimers (not shown).
in the future, the determinationof detailed crystal structures
of  xxxg470xxx  (in the absenceand presence of substrates) is hoped
to explain how the stretches around ala-323 and cys-278 are
involved in the substrate-inducedconformationalchanges, and
how these latter affect the dimer-dimer interfaces within the
octamer so as to decrease octamer stability. in addition, it
seems highly attractive to further investigatewhether selective
cleavage of the  xxxg470xxx  polypeptide chain is, in analogy to
most or all of the serpins, physiologically relevant, e.g., for
irreversible inactivation or for initiation of biodegradation of
 xxxg470xxx  in vivo.
