the hollow fibre assay (hfa) is usually applied as an early in vivo model for anti-cancer drug screening, but is potentially an excellent
model for short-term in vivo pharmacodynamic studies. we used the model to study the in vivo role of  xxxg2365xxx /
platelet-derived  xxxg786xxx  (tp/ xxxg2365xxx ) in the cytotoxicity and pharmacodynamics of tas-102 in colon cancer
cells. tas-102 is a new oral drug formulation, which is composed of  xxxd3434xxx  (tft) and  xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor
(tpi), which prevents tft degradation. we compared the activity with xeloda ( xxxd425xxx ), which is activated by tp into  xxxd2134xxx .
hollow fibres filled with human colo320 or colo320tp1 colorectal cancer cells with deficient or high tp expression, respectively,
were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) at both flanks of balb/c mice. the mice were treated orally over 5 days with tas-102, tft
alone, 50 dfur7tpi or  xxxd425xxx  at their maximum tolerated dose (mtd). the cells were retrieved from the fibres and assayed
for growth (mtt assay), cell cycle distribution (flow cytometry) and apoptosis induction (fragel method). tas-102 induced
considerable growth inhibition (50%, po0.01) to both cell lines, which was completely abolished in the absence of tpi.  xxxd425xxx 
and its metabolite 50 dfur reduced proliferation of colo320tp1 cells in the fibres significantly (down to 25 – 40%), but much less in
colo320 cells, whereas addition of tpi reduced the effect of 50 dfur, although not completely. these differences in cytotoxic effects
were reflected in the pharmacodynamic evaluation. tas-102 induced a g2m-phase arrest (from 25 to 40%) and apoptosis (48fold), which was more pronounced in colo320 than in colo320tp1. again, omission of tpi neutralised the effect of tas-102.
similarly, 50 dfur and  xxxd425xxx  induced a significant g2m-phase arrest (up to 45%) in the colo320tp1 cell line, but less
pronounced in the parental colo320. addition of tpi to 50 dfur reduced this effect to control levels. also induction of apoptosis
was reduced in the presence of tpi. the data demonstrated that the hfa is excellently suited for studying short-term
pharmacodynamic effects of fluoropyrimidines in vivo. tas-102 is only effective in inducing cytotoxicity when systemic tpi is present,
but acts against both low and high tp expressing colon cancer cells, while 50 dfur needs cellular tp to exert significant activity.

several preclinical in vitro and in vivo tumour models are being
used for the screening of potential anticancer agents. currently,
the primary focus of the national cancer institute (nci) is on the
60-tumour cell line panel. this system is based on selection of cell
lines from major disease types (venditti et al, 1984) in which the
nonclonogenic microculture tetrazolium (mtt) assay or sulphorhodamine b (srb) assay were selected to determine cytotoxicity
of the tumour cells (alley et al, 1988; skehan et al, 1990; keepers
et al, 1991). when positive (e.g. a unique profile in the compare
program), the compounds are subjected to a secondary screening
with several tumour xenograft models, the hollow fibre assay
(hfa) (hollingshead et al, 1995; hollingshead et al, 1999; suggitt
and bibby, 2005), the human tumour stem cell (htsc) assay (von
hoff et al, 1980; moon et al, 1981), and other screening model

systems including various types of clonogenic assays (fiebig et al,
1987; fiebig et al, 2004). in most in vivo models and multicellular
in vitro models mechanistic studies are not included, because
they are cumbersome, while in vivo reproducible retrieval of the
tumours is often a limitation. however, it is evident that in vivo
models and multicellular systems are closer to a clinical situation
than in vitro models (suggitt and bibby, 2005).
the in vivo hfa animal model (mi et al, 2002; decker et al,
2004), optimised by hollingshead et al (1995) (hollingshead et al,
1995), uses semipermeable biocompatible fibres that are filled
with cancer cells, heat-sealed and implanted surgically (s.c. or i.p.)
in mice or rats, which can be treated with chemotherapeutics.
many different cell lines from different tissue origins and cellular
characteristics can be encapsulated within the fibres, providing
a cost-effective screening method. most active agents screened
positive in a in vitro multicell line screening assay or indicated
xenograft-positive will not be bypassed in the hfa (hollingshead
et al, 1999; johnson et al, 2001; decker et al, 2004). in the hfa,
cytotoxicity is determined using a modified mtt assay, taken into
account the in vivo parameters, such as pharmacokinetics and

drug transport/ph/po2 at tumour site (phillips et al, 1990; jonsson
et al, 2000). additionally, several pharmacodynamic end points
can also be investigated, such as dna damage induction, apoptosis
or cell cycle analysis (hall et al, 2000; leong et al, 2004; suggitt
et al, 2004). this methodology also saves time (assay o2 weeks)
and the number of animals used in the experiments.
the novel antitumour drug formulation tas-102 (emura et al,
2004c; tsuchiya et al, 2004; emura et al, 2005) combines the
cytotoxic agent 5-trifluoro-20 - xxxd3364xxx  (tft) with an
inhibitor of the angiogenic  xxxg2365xxx /plateletderived  xxxg786xxx  (tp/ xxxg2365xxx ) (miyazono
and heldin, 1989; ackland and peters, 1999). tft inhibits
 xxxg2366xxx  (ts) and is incorporated into the dna
(eckstein et al, 1994; emura et al, 2004d; temmink et al, 2005).
the inhibitor tpi is able to inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis by
itself (matsushita et al, 1999; fukushima et al, 2000; takao et al,
2000). it was previously shown in vivo that tpi in a ratio of 1 : 0.5
(tft/tpi) was required to exert an in vivo activity (emura et al,
2004c; emura et al, 2005). however, in vitro tpi did not enhance
the effect of tft, also not in tp overexpressing cancer cells (de
bruin et al, 2003; temmink et al, 2005). tas-102 is currently
undergoing clinical trials as an oral combination drug given in
different schedules. in contrast to tas-102,  xxxd425xxx  (xeloda)
requires tp to be activated to the active metabolite 5-fluorouracil
( xxxd2134xxx ). tp catalyses the last activation step from the metabolite
50 dfur to  xxxd2134xxx . 50 dfur acts similar to  xxxd2134xxx  by inhibition of ts
and incorporation into rna and dna, although its activation
pathway may affect its final mechanisms of action (pinedo and
peters, 1988; van triest and peters, 1999; peters et al, 2002).
 xxxd425xxx  is currently widely used as an oral  xxxd2134xxx  prodrug in
the treatment of colorectal cancer (van cutsem et al, 2005; walko
and lindley, 2005).
as a result of the discrepancies between early in vivo work on
tas-102 and the in vitro data, we choose the hfa to dissect the
role of tp in the in vivo antitumour activity of tas-102. for this
purpose, we used a colon cancer cell line deficient in tp (colo320)
and its tp-transfected variant colo320tp1. as this cell line was
1000-fold more sensitive to 50 dfur, we included 50 dfur and its
prodrug  xxxd425xxx  as control compounds known to require tp
for activation. tpi was included in the therapy experiment, in
which not only growth inhibition, but also induction of cell cycle
delay and apoptosis were investigated.

materials and methods
materials
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) and hepes buffer
were purchased from cambrex bioscience (verviers, belgium) and
foetal bovine serum (fbs) from greiner bio-one (frickenhausen,
germany). tft and tpi were synthesised and provided by taiho
pharmaceuticals co. (tokushima, japan).  xxxd425xxx  and
50 dfur were provided by roche pharmaceuticals. 3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt)
and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) were purchased from sigma-aldrich
chemicals (zwijndrecht, the netherlands). bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa) was obtained from merck (darmstadt, germany). the
biocompatible modified polyvinylidene difluoride (mpvdf)
hollow fibres (cellmaxs implant membranes) with a mr 500 kda
cutoff and 1.0 mm inner diameter were purchased from spectrum
laboratories inc. (breda, the netherlands). all other chemicals
were of analytical grade and commercially available.

cell culture
the adherent mycoplasma-free human colorectal cancer cell lines
colo320 (atcc nr: ccl-220) and colo320tp1 were used for the
british journal of cancer (2007) 96(1), 61 – 66

experiments discussed in this paper. colo320tp1 is a stable tp
transfectant derived from colo320 (low tp) and has increased
expression of tp (de bruin et al, 2003). cells were grown in
dmem culture medium supplemented with 20 mm hepes buffer
and 10% heat-inactivated fbs (without antibiotics) and incubated
at 371c in a 5% co2 humidified atmosphere. the cell lines have
comparable growth rates with a doubling time of about 23 h.

preparation and in vivo implantation of the hollow fibres
the hollow fibre procedures were based on those of hollingshead
et al (1995). for the hfa immunocompetent host animals were
used to test the human cancer cell lines, which were well tolerated,
as was observed with various human cell lines in initial
experiments. we did not observe any evidence of an immune
reaction in the period that the fibres were present in the mice.
therefore, we proceeded with both colo320 variants in immunocompetent balb/c mice.
before fibre implantation into the animals, we performed in
vitro and in vivo experiments for optimisation of growth of
colo320 and colo320tp1 cells in the fibres to determine the
linearity in growth. the optimal cell suspension loading density
was 0.5 – 1  106 cells ml1. the cells were harvested by a standard
trypsinisation procedure and resuspended at the desired cell
density (7.5  105 cells ml1). the cell suspension was flushed into
the hollow fibres, whereafter they were heat-sealed and cut at 2 cm
intervals. the fibres were incubated in dmem medium in six-well
plates 24 h prior to surgical implantation in immunocompetent
6- to 8-week-old female pure strain balb/c mice (harlan, horst,
the netherlands). three fibres per cell line were implanted s.c.
with colo320 at one flank and colo320tp1 at the other flank of the
mice. this ensured that both cell lines would undergo the same
exposure reducing interindividual variation. the mice were
anesthesised by isoflurane inhalation (day 0), and the incisions
were closed using a stapling device. separate in vitro control fibres
were also prepared, and were incubated in dmem medium during
the experiment (10 days).

drug administration and retrieval of the cancer cells from
the hollow fibres
the animals were kept in cages in an air-conditioned room with
alternating cycles of light and dark and had access to food and
autoclaved water ad libitum. the protocol was approved by the
local animal ethical committee in accordance with the ukccr
guidelines. the mice were treated on day 3 with the different
fluoropyrimidines at their mtd by oral administration. we used
30 mice divided into six experimental groups: (1) control (saline);
(2) tas-102 (150 mg kg1, q1dx5, based on tft dose); (3) tft
(150 mg kg1, q1dx5); (4) 50 dfur (400 mg kg1, on d1 and d5) þ
tpi (75 mg kg1, q1dx5); (5) 50 dfur (400 mg kg1, on d1 and d5);
(6)  xxxd425xxx  (539 mg kg1, q1dx5). the mice were killed by
co2 inhalation at day 10 and the fibres were excised from the mice.
excess host tissue was removed and the fibres were transferred
into prewarmed dmem medium and incubated for at least 1 h,
whereafter the cells were retrieved from the (in vitro control) fibres
for pharmacodynamic analysis. per experimental group at least
two fibres (bearing either colo320 or colo320tp1 cells) per animal
(up to a maximum of six fibres) were used for assaying growth, cell
cycle distribution or apoptosis induction. so in each mouse three
different parameters could be assessed.

assessment of cytotoxicity
the ‘stable end point’ modified mtt assay (alley et al, 1988; xu
et al, 1998) was used to determine cytotoxicity of the cancer cells to
the fluoropyrimidine drugs after isolation of the fibres. the
samples were stained and rinsed as described by the manufacturer.

the cancer cells were retrieved from the fibres and prepared for
gated flow cytometric analysis to measure cell cycle distribution of
the cell population, as described previously (cloos et al, 2002).
briefly, the cells were washed with saline/1% bsa solution and
fixed with 70% ethanol (30 min on ice). after centrifugation, the
pellet was resuspended in 400 ml hypotonic pi solution
(0.5 mg ml1 rnase, 50 mg ml1 pi, 1 mg ml1 sodium citrate,
1 ml ml1 triton x-100 in saline) and incubated on ice (in the dark)
for at least 15 min. thereafter, the percentage of cells in the
different cell cycle phases (g1, s, g2 m) was measured using a
facscan flow cytometer (becton dickinson immunocytometry
systems, san jose, ca, usa). for each measurement 25 000 cells
were counted and each sample was assayed in duplicate. for
calculation of the cell cycle distribution the becton dickinson’s
cellquest software was used. the total number of cells in these
fractions was set at 100%.

apoptosis analysis
the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (tdt)-mediated dntp
labelling method was used for the detection of cells undergoing
apoptosis (see also bentz et al, 2004). we used the tdt-dnafragment end labeling kit (frageltm; calbiochem, oncogene
research products, cambridge, ma, usa). in this method, tdt
binds to exposed 30 -oh ends of dna fragments generated in
apoptotic cells in order to add biotin-(un)labelled dntps, which
are detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. the staining of the cells was performed according to the
manufacturer’s recommended procedure. cells stained positive
with 30 -30 -diaminobenzidine (dab) produce a brownish colour,
whereas nonreactive cells were counterstained with methylgreen.
 xxxd1800xxx -treated hl60 cells were included in the kit and
served as positive controls whereas negative controls were
untreated cells grown in tissue culture flasks. using light
microscopy, 1000 cells were counted twice for positive/negative
staining on randomly selected areas on the glass slide. the
apoptosis enrichment factor was calculated as ((%) positive
staining cells treated)/((%) positive staining cells control). cells
were defined as apoptotic when the (major part of) nuclear area
was percentage-wise dab-labelled.

statistics
the (un)paired student’s t-test was used for statistical evaluation
of the results. changes were considered to be significant when

evaluation of hollow fibre model
the hollow fibres were quite well tolerated by the immunocompetent mice. the chemotherapeutic treatments did not affect the
conditions of the mice beyond acceptable limits. the average body
weight loss of the mice on day 10 was not more than 11%
compared to the start of the treatment (day 3). we observed blood
vessel formation around the implanted fibres after retrieval from
the animals, and macroscopically a slight reduction in blood vessel
formation was detected in the tpi treated animals, although not
significantly. the antiangiogenic tpi is able to suppress angiogenesis in cells transfected with tp (matsushita et al, 1999).
after the treatment period cytotoxicity was assessed using the
‘stable end point’ modified mtt assay. compared to the control
fibres, tas-102 treatment produced a significant reduction in net
growth of about 50% for both colo320 and colo320tp1 (po0.01)
(figure 1). omission of tpi from the tas-102 formulation
completely abolished the antitumour effect of tas-102; tft alone
was ineffective, underlining the importance of systemic inhibition
of tp to increase bioavailability of tft. the animals were also
treated with  xxxd425xxx  and its intermediate 50 dfur to
demonstrate the essential role of the presence of sufficient cellular
tp activity, and to differentiate between the systemic and cellular
effect of tpi. both drugs were less active in colo320 cells compared
to colo320tp1 cells (po0.01), and addition of tpi completely
abolished the activity of 50 dfur in colo320 cells.

cell cycle phase distribution
from all experimental groups cell suspensions were retrieved from
fibres of different animals to be assayed for cell cycle phase
distribution (figure 2). representative dna histograms are
depicted in figure 3. the cell cycle distribution in the in vivo
control fibres was not significantly different from the in vitro
control fibres, although a tendency for increased g2m-phase was
found. in all drug-treated animals the s-phase population hardly
changed compared to the in vivo control fibres. in contrast, tas102 treatment resulted in a clear g2m-phase arrest for both cell
lines (po0.05). however, omission of tpi from the tas-102
formulation completely neutralised this effect. treatment of

treatment prevented the induction of g2m-phase arrest in
colo320tp1 cells. these data all underline the importance of
cellular activation of 50 dfur.

discussion
this paper shows that the hfa can be used conveniently to
demonstrate the importance of tp in the activity or resistance to
various oral fluoropyrimidine formulations. the tas-102 formulation, consisting of tft and tpi, was inactive without tpi
administration. however, in in vitro studies the presence of tpi
did not enhance the activity of tft, underlining the importance
of suitable in vivo systems to investigate this formulation. the

colo320, which was accompanied by less pronounced cell cycle
effects and apoptosis. however, both 50 dfur and  xxxd425xxx 
showed activity in the tp deficient colo320, which is not in line
with the large difference found in vitro (de bruin et al, 2003;
temmink et al, 2005). the partial protection by tpi of 50 dfur0 s
cytotoxicity against colo320 demonstrates that 50 dfur is systemically converted to  xxxd2134xxx , contradicting a selective cellular specificity
of 50 dfur. although tpi protected the cells from 50 dfur, this
was only partial as can clearly be seen from the apoptotic effect.
this demonstrated that 50 dfur activation is not only dependent
on tp, as anticipated (de bruin et al, 2006), but also that another
phosphorylase, presumably  xxxg2391xxx , plays a role.
in contrast, a high tp expression might theoretically inactivate
tft, but this does not seem to happen. in vitro tft is cytotoxic
against high tp expressing cells, and here we show that tas-102 is
also equally active against high and low tp expressing cells. this
means that for in vivo and clinical application high tp levels in the
tumour are not necessarily a negative parameter, while tas-102 is
active against low tp expressing cells, in contrast to 50 dfur,
which needs high tp for selectivity.
an additional advantage of tas-102 will be the potential
antiangiogenic effect of tpi. phillips et al (1998) reported that
efficiency of drug delivery and the subsequent effects on
chemosensitivity of the encapsulated tumour cells in the hollow
fibre can be enhanced due to increased angiogenesis. after at least
6-days, the mice carrying hollow fibres s.c. may develop extensive
vascular networks. for long-term angiogenesis studies the postimplantation time must be extended to determine the effect of a
potentially antiangiogenic treatment. regarding these studies it
may be interesting to investigate tas-102 with respect to
inhibition of blood vessel formation in tumours since tpi also
inhibits  xxxg2365xxx , which is considered to be proangiogenic
(haraguchi et al, 1994). we observed after 10-days treatment with
tas-102 that tpi acts as an antiangiogenic compound (as
previously shown (matsushita et al, 1999; emura et al, 2005))
and is likely to be related to the suppression of metastasis (takao
et al, 2000; sato et al, 2003). with respect to these findings it
will be interesting to combine tas-102 with other agents that
counteract blood vessel formation such as bevacizumab, which
targets the proangiogenic vegf. another possibility is to combine
tas-102 with other novel agents in the future, such as the egfrtargeting cetuximab or  xxxd2029xxx .
in conclusion, tas-102 was effective in the hfa, which was not
only shown by a clear cytotoxicity, but also by the change in
several pharmacodynamic end points in vivo, such as cell cycle
distribution and apoptosis. these parameters could be studied
conveniently in vivo, and provide an excellent basis to study the
antitumour activity of potential tas-102 applications using the
hfa, such as in combination with targeted agents.

intermediate of  xxxd425xxx , 50 dfur, was inactive in cells with
low tp expression.
the hfa is currently used by the nci in the us for secondary
drug screening and saves time and labour compared to the
classical tumour implantation experiments. recently, several
papers have been published demonstrating that the hfa is also
suited for short-term in vivo pharmacodynamic studies (hall et al,
2000; leong et al, 2004; suggitt et al, 2004; suggitt and bibby,
2005), thereby using immunocompetent mice for the growth of
human cells, without problems such as infiltrating immune cells in
this period. our results showed that the hfa is excellently suitable
for studying several pharmacodynamic end points in cancer cells
when treated in vivo with fluoropyrimidines.
the advantage of the hfa for our studies was the possibility to
investigate the in vivo role of tpi in the formulation tas-102. in
previous in vitro studies, we did not observe an advantage of tpi
in a combination with tft, even not in cancer cells with high tp
expression (de bruin et al, 2003; temmink et al, 2005). this was
despite previous observations that tpi was essential to observe an
antitumour effect of tft (fukushima et al, 2000; emura et al,
2004c), by increasing the bioavailability of tft (emura et al,
2005). tft has been evaluated in early clinical trials as a single
agent (ansfield and ramirez, 1971), but proved to be ineffective in
colorectal cancer patients, probably because of its rapid and
extensive degradation by tp and subsequent elimination from the
body. tas-102 was developed to bypass these limitations, while it
is also active in  xxxd2134xxx -resistant tumours (emura et al, 2004a, d). the
presence of tpi has the additional advantage that it induces an
antiangiogenic effect (matsushita et al, 1999). currently, three
phase i trials are being performed with tas-102, but no efficacy
data are available.
in contrast to in vitro studies, but similar to the early clinical
studies (ansfield and ramirez, 1971), tft alone was highly
ineffective, even against colo320, which has a very low tp
expression and is very sensitive to the drug in vitro. tft
apparently does not reach the cancer cells in order to exert any
activity. however, tpi significantly improved tft-mediated
cytotoxicity to both low tp expressing colo320 and even the
high tp expressing colo320tp1 cells. flow cytometric analysis
showed that tas-102 treatment induced a g2m-phase arrest in the
cell populations, and induced apoptosis in the p53 mutated
colo320 cells, probably as a result of the induced cell cycle delay.
matsushita et al (1999) previously showed that treatment with tpi
alone can increase apoptosis induction in tumours of the high tp
expressing human kb epidermoid carcinoma. however, the main
action of tpi seemed to consist of the increase in the bioavailability in the hollow fibres, enabling to activate tft similarly in
colo320 and colo320tp1 cells, because these two cell lines showed
similar cell cycle disturbances and apoptosis. in addition, tpi can
also increase tdr concentrations in plasma (emura et al, 2004b),
which can prevent breakdown of tft, because tdr can compete
with tft in tp-mediated phosphorolysis. in vitro we did not find
evidence that this tdr accumulation would negatively affect tftinduced cytotoxicity.
as a positive control to differentiate between the in vivo
systemic and cellular role of tp in the activity of fluoropyrimidines, we investigated the effect of  xxxd425xxx  and its intermediate 50 dfur. both drugs were less effective in the wild-type
