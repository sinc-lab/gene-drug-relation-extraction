summary. in this paper a variety of mercurials, including a
pcmb-nitroxide analogue, were used to study urea transport in
human red cell ghosts. it was determined that the rate of inhibition for pcmbs, pcmb, pcmb-nitroxide, and  xxxd1670xxx 
extended over four orders of magnitude consistent with their
measured oil/water partition coefficients. from these results, we
concluded that a significant hydrophobic barrier limits access to
the urea inhibition site, suggesting that the urea site is buried in
the bilayer or in a hydrophobic region of the transporter. in
contrast, the rate of water inhibition by the mercurials ranged by
only a factor of four and did not correlate with their hydrophobicities. thus, the water inhibition site may be more directly
accessible via the aqueous phase. under conditions that leave
water transport unaffected, we determined that <-32,000 labeled
sites per cell corresponded to complete inhibition of urea transport. this rules out major transmembrane proteins such as band
3, the glucose carrier, and  xxxg180xxx  as candidates for the urea
transporter. in contrast, this result is consistent with the kidd
(jk) antigen being the urea transporter with an estimated 14,000
copies per cell. from the experimental number of urea sites, a
turnover number between 2-6 x 106 sec 1 at 22~ is calculated
suggesting a channel mechanism.

introduction
biophysical and biochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of a facilitated transport system for urea in the human erythrocyte membrane.
evidence for a specific urea transporter includes a
two orders of magnitude higher membrane permeability and a lower activation energy compared to
pure lipid bilayers, saturation at high urea concentrations, and inhibition by mercurials and urea analogues (macey & farmer, 1970; brahm, 1983; mayrand & levitt, 1983; macey, 1984; toon &
solomon, 1986). although mercurial reagents in-

hibit both urea and water transport (macey &
farmer, 1970), the different kinetics of inhibition
(macey, 1984), and the three orders of magnitude
greater sensitivity of urea transport (toon & solomon, 1986) indicate that separate sites are involved.
two main features are generally required for a
transmembrane protein to be a candidate for the
urea transporter: (i) enough copies per cell to account for red cell permeability, and (ii) the presence
of sulfhydryl group(s) unreactive with  xxxd2684xxx  (nem) but reactive with mercurials, since
these reagents still inhibit urea (and water) transport in nem-treated cells (sha'afi & feinstein,
1977). it has been argued that only band 3 and band
4.5 meet both requirements (solomon et al., 1983).
however, there are two problems in this approach.
first, estimates of the number of channels cannot
be considered reliable because they depend on various assumptions. for instance, finkelstein (1987)
estimated approximately 105 urea channels per
erythrocyte from the ratio of the maximum unidirectional urea flux per cell to the maximum unidirectional flux of the gramicidin a pore. in contrast,
toon et al. (1985) assumed a hypothetical value for
the steric hindrance and for the pore radius that
gave a value of 2.7 x 105 channels. second, as the
sulfhydryl content and reactivity of many red cell
membrane polypeptides are not known, it is not
possible to exclude a still unidentified membrane
protein as the urea transporter. for instance, the
band 4.5 region consists of at least six different
polypeptides presumably between 45-55 kd (jones
& nickson, 1980) with a content of 3.6 nem-unreactive sulfhydryl per tool of protein (haest, kamp
& deuticke, 1981). from this group of proteins, the
glucose transporter is the only component that has
been assigned a specific function (jones & nickson,
1981; mueckler et al., 1985).

86

previously, solomon and co-workers (1983)
proposed that band 3 furnishes an aqueous pore that
provides a common membrane pathway for the permeation of anions, cations, small nonelectrolytes,
and water. this model implies a coupling of water
and urea transport that should be evidenced by reflection coefficients significantly less than unity.
however, experimental results from different laboratories have been inconsistent with reflection coefficient values ranging from 0.6 to 0.95, pointing to
methodological difficulties in the measurement of
this parameter (gold~tein & solomon, 1960; levitt
& mlekoday, 1983; macey, 1984; toon & solomon,
1987). ojcius and solomon (1988) have subsequently claimed additional support for a unitary
pore model on the basis of labeling studies with
2~
concluding that both urea and water
transport inhibition sites are located on band 3 tetramers. however, the reversibility and nonspecificity
of pcmbs binding compromise these labeling studies. further, benga and co-workers (1986) reported
that, under conditions that inhibit water transport in
nem-pretreated cells, 2~
labels not
only band 3, but also another polypeptide that migrates in the band 4.5 region.
recent evidence indicates that proteins other
than band 3 are likely to be responsible for urea and
water transport.  xxxg180xxx , a 28-kd transmembrane
protein abundant in human erythrocytes (1.2-2.0 x
 xxxd794xxx  copies per cell) has been expressed in oocytes
from xenopus laevis and shown to increase their
osmotic water permeability (preston et al., 1992).
the increased water permeability is proportional to
the amount of  xxxg180xxx  expressed, is inhibited by
mercuric chloride, and the inhibition is reversed by
/3- xxxd26xxx . these observations strongly
suggest that  xxxg180xxx , and not band 3, is the human
red cell water channel. further, the finding that facilitated urea transport is absent in erythrocytes
from a rare blood type lacking the kidd antigen
(jk(a-b-)) (gargus, brunner-jackson & malone,
1988; gargus & mitas, 1988; frohlich et al., 1991)
while having normal water and anion permeability,
suggests that this antigen is the urea transporter.
in this paper we use a variety of mercurials,
including a pcmb-nitroxide analogue, to study urea
transport in human red cell ghosts. under conditions that leave water transport unaffected but fully
inhibit facilitated urea transport, we measure
---32,000 labeled sites per cell. this number is an
upper limit for the number of urea transport sites,
and rules out major transmembrane candidate proteins such as band 3, the glucose carrier, and
 xxxg180xxx . in contrast, this result is consistent with
the jk antigen being the urea transporter with an
estimated 14,000 copies per cell (masouredis et al.,

l.m. mannuzzu et al.: estimate of urea transporters

1980). from our estimate of the number of urea
sites, we calculate a turnover number between
2-6 x 106 s e c -1 at 22~ which suggests a channel
mechanism. by comparing the kinetics of inhibition
of urea permeability by pcmb-nitroxide and other
mercurials to the oil/water partition coefficients of
the inhibitors, we conclude that there is a significant
hydrophobic barrier to inhibition of urea transport,
and propose that the urea inhibitory site is buried in
the bilayer or in a hydrophobic region of the protein. on the other hand, the kinetics of water inhibition does not significantly correlate with the hydrophobicity of the mercurials. this suggests that the
rate of water inhibition is not limited by diffusion
through a hydrophobic barrier, but by a subsequent
step involved in closing the channel.
materials and methods
ghost and solution preparation
human venous blood, freshly drawn with edta or acid citrate
dextrose (acd) as anticoagulant, was used in all the binding
experiments within one day of collection. for other experiments,
fresh blood or recently expired blood bank blood was used. after
centrifugation, plasma and buffy coat were discarded, and the
erythrocytes washed three times in phosphate buffered saline
(150 m s  xxxg2020xxx , 10 mm phosphate, and ph 7.4).
resealed ghosts were prepared essentially according to
funder and wieth (1976). washed  xxxd187xxx  (suspended at 50%
hct in isotonic naci) were hypotonically lysed in 10 vol of 4 mm
 xxxd2534xxx  plus 4 mm acetic acid (2 mm acetic acid for fresh blood) at
0-2~ after a 5-min incubation, the suspension was made isotonic and the ph raised to 7.4 using kc1 and tris. after an
additional 5 min, ghosts were resealed by incubating the suspension at 37~ for 1 hr. the ghosts were then washed several times
by centrifugation at 40,000 x g for 10 min.
in most experiments, resealed ghosts (25% hct in isotonic
kci, ph 7.4) were incubated with 10 mm  xxxd2684xxx 
(nem) for 1 hr at 37~ a 150-mm nem stock solution was
made fresh before each use.
solution osmolarities were measured using a wescor vapor
pressure osmometer. cell counts were done using an electrozone/celloscope (particle data) coulter counter.

spin l a b e l synthesis
the mercurial spin label (pcmbn, shown below) was synthesized according to the procedure used by chen (1976); 7.5 mmol
of l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride was added to a mixture of 3 mmol of p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pcmb) and 3 mmol of 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-n-oxyl (4-amino-tempo) in 30 ml of dry acetone.
the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature.
subsequently, the acetone phase was collected and concentrated
by evaporation, the resulting solution was applied to a silica gel
column (silica woelm tsc) and chromatographed using acetone
as the elution solvent. the mercurial spin label fraction was collected and gave a single spot when checked for purity by thin

esr measurements were done on an ibm model er 200d-src
electron spin resonance spectrometer, equipped with an ibmat and a data translation dt2800 series acquisition board. acquisition and analysis programs were developed using asyst, a
forth-based compiler and subroutine library package. microwave power was 9.9 mw, klystron frequency was 9.78 ghz.
transport measurements were done using essentially the
method of moronne et al. (1990) with a computer-controlled
stop-flow employing a biokine syringe drive or a vacuum aspirator. the esr method is free of transient optical artifacts and drift
associated with light scattering measurements. these advantages
are particularly relevant if ghosts are used, since light scattering
is greatly reduced resulting in poor signal to noise ratios. volume
transients were measured using the spin probe tempone (2,2,6,6tetramethyl piperidone-n-oxyl), and the impermeable quencher
potassium chromium oxalate. all measurements were made at
22~ and ph 7.4.
for osmotic water permeability coefficient (pt) measurements, resealed ghosts were suspended at 20% hct in an isotonic
medium (ram: 65 kci, 50 quencher, 2 tempone, and 10 phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) and challenged with one volume o f a hypertonic solution (ram: 100 kc1, 50 quencher, 2 tempone, and 10

goal of this report is neither to choose between models nor to
determine absolute estimates of transport parameters. rather,
we hope to characterize a new inhibitor and to use it to establish
an upper limit to the number of transporters. our entire analysis
only requires estimates of changes in relative permeability, i.e.,
the ratio of permeability in inhibitor-treated cells to that in control cells. fortunately, this ratio is remarkably insensitive to
choices of model or of parameters. we have analyzed our data
assuming parameters obtained from the literature for carrier,
channel, and even straight diffusion models (ps(c,) = constant)
only to arrive at the same conclusions regarding inhibitor properties and transporter site estimates. although the estimates of
absolute permeabilities are sensitive to these choices, the ratio is
not. in the data analysis shown here, we have assumed eq. (3)
together with cr - 0.95 (levitt & mlekoday, 1983; macey, 1984)
and k~, and kout, respectively, in normalized units, equal to 1.69

a 10-~m solution of each organic mercurial dissolved in isotonic kci (ph 7.4) was shaken against
an equal volume of octanol for 24 hr at 22~ in the
dark. the samples were then centrifuged and mercury determined in both phases. to avoid having to
digest large amounts of octanol, the mercurials
were back-extracted from the oil phase with 20 mm
cysteine at ph 8.5. two extractions were sufficient
to remove all the mercurials from the octanol. the
low concentration of mercurials used guaranteed
that saturation effects did not compromise the

membrane and cytosolic sulfhydryls makes meaningful analysis of mercurial binding in intact cells
impossible. in order to reduce the nonspecific binding of mercurials, the following procedures were
applied. first, the cytosolic sulfhydryl pool was
largely eliminated by using resealed ghost red cell
preparations that have been shown to maintain the
same water and urea permeabilities as intact cells
(colombe & macey, 1974; ojcius, toon & solomon, 1988). second, all ghost preparations were
treated with nem, which has been shown to react
irreversibly with about 80% of membrane thiols
(haest et al., 1981) without affecting water and urea
permeability or their inhibition by mercurials
(sha'afi & feinstein, 1977; solomon et al., 1983).

fig. 3, stop-flow esr measurement of pcmbn influx in resealed ghosts. resealed ghosts were suspended at 20% hct in an
isotonic medium (mm: 65 kc1, 50 quencher, and 10 phosphate
buffer, ph 7.4) and challenged with one volume of the same
medium plus 150/xm pcmbn. the magnetic field was set at the
low-field peak resonance of pcmbn. the unbroken line represents the nonlinear least-square fit of the data to one exponential
with 3.84 second time constant.

figure 2 (a and b) compares the time-dependent inhibition of urea and water transport for the
same concentration of pcmbs, pcmb,  xxxd1670xxx  and pcmbn with each curve fitted to a single
exponential. in the case of water transport, the rate
of inhibition depends only slightly on the mercurial
structure. from the initial rates in fig. 2b the inhibition by the most efficient mercurial (pcmb) is
about four times faster than that of the least efficient
( xxxd1670xxx ), and the nitroxide rate is about 50%
slower than pcmb. on the other hand, the kinetics
of urea inhibition shows a dramatic difference between pcmbn and the other mercurials. in this
case, the nitroxide inhibition rate is more than two
orders of magnitude faster than for pcmb and
 xxxd1670xxx , and three orders of magnitude faster
than that of pcmbs (fig. 2a). the same relative
results were obtained using several other inhibitor
concentrations (25-100/zm for urea and 0.25-i mm
for water transport; data not shown).
the main difference between the structure of
the fastest (pcmbn) and the slowest inhibitor of
urea transport (pcmbs) is the replacement of the
charged sulfonic group by the nitroxide ring, which
makes it much more hydrophobic. the high membrane solubility of pcmbn is indicated by the 3.84
second time constant for equilibration in a 10%
ghost suspension (fig. 3). in comparison, pcmbs
permeation as measured by knauf and rothstein
(1971) is several orders of magnitude slower. in or-

der to evaluate the relationship between mercurial
hydrophobicity and rate of inhibition, the octanol/
water partition coefficients of the mercurial reagents were estimated (see materials and methods).
the results of this experiment (table 1) confirm that
the more hydrophobic the inhibitor the higher the
rate of inhibition, with the nitroxide mercurial between two and four orders of magnitude more hydrophobic than the other compounds. these results
suggest that the comparatively fast rate of inhibition
of urea transport by pcmbn is a consequence of an
enhanced rate of diffusion to the urea inhibition
site, and may indicate that the site is buried in a
hydrophobic environment or the pathway to the site
includes a significant hydrophobic barrier. on the
other hand, the lack of significant correlation between the kinetics of water inhibition and the mercurial hydrophobicity seem to indicate that the rate
of water inhibition is not dominated by a hydrophobic barrier.

pcmbn inhibition

kinetics

the concentration and time dependence of urea and
water transport inhibition by pcmbn were further
investigated in the experiments shown in fig. 4
(a and b), where urea and water permeability of
nem-treated ghosts (10% hct) were measured during incubation with different concentrations of inhibitor. the effect of the nitroxide on urea permeability is indeed very rapid even at very low inhibitor
concentrations: 1 /.zm pcmbn produces maximal
inhibition in less than 5 min without affecting water
permeability. in comparison, 100 ~m spin label inhibits water transport only 5-10%, even after a 2-hr
incubation with nem-treated ghosts (10% hct). in
order to achieve maximal water inhibition, it is necessary to incubate ghosts for more than 1 hr with
concentrations about three orders of magnitude
higher (i ram) than those that fully inhibit urea
transport.
to analyze these data, the inhibition of urea
transport by mercurials is assumed to be a two-step
process. the first step is the partitioning of the inhibitor into the membrane; the second step is the
reaction with the site that blocks the transporter.

the analysis can be simplified by assuming that
the diffusion step is fast compared to the reaction

basis that access of the inhibitor to the urea site is
diffusion limited by a hydrophobic barrier.

figure 7 shows the volume perturbation experiments done to estimate the k; of pcmbn inhibition
of urea transport. nem-treated ghosts, suspended
 xxxd1891xxx % hct in an isotonic medium without urea,
were incubated with pcmbn (0.1-5/zm) for 30 min
at 22~ (the effect on urea permeability of the lowest inhibitor concentrations used is completed in
about 15 min.) one volume of ghost suspension was
then challenged with one volume of the same isotonic medium plus urea (260 mm final concentration), so that ghosts first shrink and then swell to
their original volume. as the urea permeability decreases, both the equilibration time and the amplitude of the shrink-swell response increase. urea
permeabilities were estimated by fitting the volumevs.-time curves to the kedem-katchalsky equations
(see materials and methods). a plot of the residual
permeability vs. the concentration of inhibitor is
shown in fig. 8.
according to the model given by eq. (4), at
equilibrium the urea permeability should depend on
the nitroxide concentration according to

from the data in fig. 8, an apparent half inhibition constant of 0.25 /xm is obtained based on the
added concentration. this result is similar to the
value obtained by toon and solomon (1986) for
pcmbs (-0.1/zm). however, whereas the free and
added concentrations for pcmbs probably do not
differ very much, for pcmbn very little is expected
to be free in solution due to its hydrophobicity (fig.
6). in order to apply eq. (11) to estimate ki, it is
necessary to determine the free concentrations of
probe at equilibrium. unfortunately, a complete
analysis was not possible owing to the fact that for
added pcmbn concentrations lower than 0.5 /zm,
the free inhibitor concentration is so low (<5 nm)
that it could not be measured reliably with the aa
spectrometer. the lowest free concentration measured (6.5 rim) already produced more than 80%
inhibition (see insert fig. 8). thus, for a single site
model (i.e., n = 1) k; < 6.5 nm. k/ can also be
estimated from the kinetic data shown in fig. 5. the
ratio between the intercept and the slope of the linear fit in fig. 5 gives a value of 13.6 nm for the k;,

where kj is the dissociation constant for the binding

water permeability in the absence of inhibitor. the
best fit (solid curve in fig. 9) corresponds to a value
of 1.94 for n, and (0.028 mm) 1'94 for kj, which indicates that two molecules of pcmbn must bind to
the water channel in order to close it. this result
differs from the 1 : 1 stoichiometry previously found
for pcmbs (moura et al., 1984; toon & solomon,

1986); however, the same 2:1 stoichiometry was
measured for pcmb inhibition of water transport
(moura, 1977).
reversal of water
and u r e a transport inhibition

pcmbs inhibition of water transport is rapidly and
completely reversed by cysteine (macey & farmer,
1970; naccache & sha'afi, 1974). however, toon
and solomon (1986) found that urea transport inhibited by pcmbs is not reversed by cysteine, and
concluded that either the inhibition site is not a sulfhydryl group or the reaction with the mercurial
makes the site inaccessible. analogous experiments
with pcmbn agree with the earlier findings. cysteine easily reverses pcmbn inhibition of water
transport (data not shown), but has little effect on
pcmbn inhibition of urea transport (fig. 10,
column 3).
in contrast to cysteine, the more hydrophobic
reagents dithiothreitol (dtt) and /3- xxxd26xxx  (b-me) are able to completely restore the
urea permeability. this is shown in fig. 10
(columns 4 and 6) where these reagents are able to
completely reverse the effect of 100/xm pcmbn on
urea permeability. the reversal of urea transport
inhibition is comparatively slow requiring about 40
rain of incubation at 37~ evidence that this effect
depends directly on the release of mercurial from
the urea transporter, and not the result of nonspecific membrane damage, is provided by the observa-

n u m b e r of urea inhibition sites

esr measurements

one of the main difficulties in identifying the proteins responsible for water and urea transport is the
lack of an inhibitor that specifically and irreversibly
binds to the transporter. although the effect of
pcmbn on urea permeability can be reversed, this
reagent can be used as a marker for the urea site for
the following reasons: (i) urea transport is inhibited
very rapidly by low concentrations that apparently
do not affect water permeability; (ii) water transport
inhibition is reversed by incubating ghosts with cysteine with little effect on urea inhibition; (iii) the
same procedure releases most of the bound spin
label, increasing the specificity of the nitroxide for
the urea inhibition site.
this last point is illustrated in fig. 11, which
shows the spectra of labeled ghosts before and after
cysteine treatment. nem-treated ghosts (20% hct)
were first incubated with 2.5/xm spin label for 5 min
at 22~ and then treated with 10 mm cysteine and
washed. precautions were taken to ensure that during these procedures the spin label was protected
from destruction by red cell components such as

catalyzed reduction (belkin et al., 1987). this was
accomplished by pretreating cells with tempol,
and inclusion of  xxxd1824xxx  to chelate free iron
both during cell lysis and while incubating with cysteine. in this way, nitroxide destruction was largely
prevented; without it, more than 90% of the signal
may be lost.
it was found that incubating with cysteine released about 92% of the spin label bound to ghosts
(fig. 11a and b). the spectrum of the remaining
signal shows a very mobile component that disappears in the presence of the collisional quencher
chromium oxalate. therefore, this component appears accessible to the solvent, and may in fact be
due to residual cysteine-pcmbn still present after
washing. the remaining signal is fairly immobilized
and may be buried in the membrane. although double integration of strongly broadened signals tends
to be inaccurate, an estimate of 5.0 x 10 4 nitroxides/cell is obtained from the data in fig. 1 lb. as
will be shown, this approximately agrees with the
more accurate results obtained by direct assay of
mercury using aa.

bition. with this approach, an estimate of about
32,000 labeled sites per cell for complete inhibition
is obtained. this represents an upper limit to the
number of urea transporters since the transporter
may bind more than a single mercury and it is unlikely that p c m b n binding is entirely specific for
the urea site. nonetheless, it is clear that the urea
transporter is a relatively minor protein component
of the red cell membrane.

the plot of the fractional inhibition of urea transport v s . the mercury bound per ghost appears to be
biphasic: an initial linear phase with a maximum
inhibition of about 72% corresponding to 22,000 labeled sites is followed by a second component that
results in only a 10% increase of inhibition while the
number of labeled sites double. since at the higher
inhibitor concentrations it is more likely that nonspecific binding occurs, the early linear part of the
graph was used to compute the number of urea
transporters per cell by extrapolating to 100% inhi-

discussion

mercurial binding to the u r e a
and w a t e r inhibition sites

we have shown that the rate of urea transport inhibition by mercurials is an increasing function of the
hydrophobicity of the mercurial (table i). this suggests that either the inhibitory site is in a hydrophobic environment or access to the site requires transport through a hydrophobic barrier. extrapolation
of data such as those shown in fig. 5 to equal concentrations of inhibitors, indicates that the nitroxide
inhibition rate is about 280 times faster than  xxxd1670xxx , 480 times faster than pcmb, and about
2,700 times faster than pcmbs. in addition, compared to pcmbs the spin label has several orders of
magnitude larger koct/water and membrane permeability. consistent with this finding is the fact that urea
transport inhibition can be reversed only by hydrophobic sulfhydryl reagents: cysteine and glutathione are ineffective, whereas dtt and

l.m. mannuzzu et al.: estimate of urea transporters

/3- xxxd26xxx  slowly but completely reverse
the effect of mercurials on urea permeability. these
data indicate that the urea inhibition site is probably
localized in the protein interior or at the proteinlipid interface.
from the experiment shown in fig. 2, a 2.3-fold
faster rate of inhibition was obtained for pcmb
compared to pcmbs. these results do not agree
with those of toon and solomon (1986), who measured a ko, rate constant about 6 times larger for
pcmbs than pcmb. a possible explanation for this
discrepancy comes from the fact that they used the
added and not the free concentration of inhibitors
for their analysis of the inhibition kinetics. it has
been shown that, since pcmb is more lipid soluble
than pcmbs, and permeates the cell membrane
much faster, the uptake of pcmb by  xxxd187xxx  can
be substantial (vansteveninck, weed & rothstein,
1965; shapiro, kol!mann & martin, 1970; moura,
1977). moura found that, when  xxxd187xxx  (3% hct)
are incubated with pcmb, the free inhibitor concentration is only between 35-65% of the concentration added to the cell suspension for all concentrations tested (0.05-1 mm). it is possible that,
especially at the low mercurial concentrations used
by toon and solomon (up to 10 tzm), the significant
decrease of pcmb concentration in the medium
compared to pcmbs introduces an error in the kinetics study. although we did not measure the free
inhibitor concentrations in the experiments shown
in fig. 2, binding to hemoglobin was eliminated by
using ghosts instead of whole cells, and higher inhibitor concentrations (>25/xm) were used.
the data presented in this paper also confirm
that the water inhibition site is distinct from the
urea site. for the mercurials studied, the rate of
water inhibition ranged by only a factor of four,
even though the hydrophobicities spanned four orders of magnitude. this is consistent with the notion that the rate-limiting step in the water inhibition
by mercurials is not diffusion to the site, but some
other subsequent step in the process that closes the
channel, such as a conformational change of the
protein (toon & solomon, 1986). in addition, the
effect of mercurials on water permeability can be
rapidly reversed by cysteine with no effect on urea
inhibition.
n u m b e r of u r e a t r a n s p o r t s i t e s

since the number of binding sites for urea inhibition
by mercurials is -<32,000 per cell, the protein responsible for urea transport may be considered a
minor component of the red cell membrane. this
estimate comes from measurements done under
conditions that minimize but probably do not com-

pletely eliminate nonspecific binding. therefore,
this number should be considered an upper estimate
of the urea transporter number.
in the past, band 3 has been proposed as the
urea transport protein on the supposition that a
large number of transporters are required to account for the high red cell urea permeability (solomon et al., 1983; toon et al., 1985). however, this
number depends on assumptions such as the transport mechanism (carrier or channel) and the turnover rate. the same high permeability can be explained by a small number of channels with a high
turnover rate. the upper estimate of 32,000 urea
transporters per cell rules out integral proteins
present in the erythrocyte membrane in high density, such as band 3, the glucose carrier and the
water channel  xxxg180xxx  (table 2), and points to a
minor membrane protein component such as the
kidd antigen.
in 1982, heaton and mclaughlin reported that
cells lacking the kidd antigen ok(a-b-)) were resistant to lysis in an electrolyte-free, 2 m urea medium.
this observation was later confirmed by large population surveys (woodfield et al., 1982; okubo et al.,
1986). frohlich et al. (1991) measured urea and
thiourea fluxes in jk(a-b-) erythrocytes and found
them devoid of mediated transport. in the jk(a-b-)
cells, urea permeability is about three orders of
magnitude lower than in normal cells, lacks the kinetic characteristics of mediated transport (which
suggests that urea moves by simple diffusion
through the lipid bilayer), and is insensitive to
thionicotinamide, pcmbs and phloretin. in comparison, these ceils have normal water, anion, and
ethylene glycol permeabilities (frohlich et al.,
1991). these results, together with the additional
finding that the urea transport activity and kidd antigenicity are expressed at the same time during red
cell maturation (gargus & mitas, 1988; gargus et
al., 1988), suggest that the urea transporter and
kidd antigen are the same protein. our estimate of

96

the maximum number of mercury binding sites is in
keeping with the estimate of 14,000 kidd antigens
per cell (masouredis et al., 1980) and further supports identification of the kidd antigen as the urea
transporter.

u r e a transport mechanism

to date, it has not been possible to establish the
urea transport mechanism since saturation, asymmetric kinetics, competitive and noncompetitive inhibition are all compatible with either a channel
with saturable and specific binding site(s) or a carrier (macey, 1986; stein, 1986). the trans-acceleration test, which can be used to distinguish between
carrier and channel, is difficult to apply to urea
transport because, as urea is a fast penetrant, intracellular urea concentration and cell volume change
during the time course of the trans-acceleration experiment, and osmotic equilibrium cannot be assumed. frohlich and trammel (1987) applied the
trans-acceleration test to the transport of thiourea,
which permeates the red cell membrane more
slowly than urea, presumably through the same
pathway. they found no trans-acceleration for
thiourea transport. although a negative test does
not rule out a carrier mechanism, the carrier systems most studied in human red blood cells show
trans-acceleration (e.g., glucose, leucine, uridine
and choline; stein, 1986).
yousef and macey (1989) used the dependence
of urea permeability on the permeant concentration
to distinguish between simple diffusion, simple pore
or simple carrier kinetics. although they could not
absolutely exclude a carrier, their data are well described by a single pore model.
one of the features that distinguishes all identified carriers from channels is the much smaller rate
at which they transport substrates (stein, 1986). for
instance, the turnover of the erythrocyte anion exchanger, one of the fastest known carriers, is 7.7 x
103 at 20~ and 5 x i04 at 38~ (brahm, 1977), between three and four orders of magnitude smaller
than that of channels. using the value of 32,000
transporters per cell, and estimated value for vmax
(0.82 x 10 .7 mol cm 2 s e c -1, brahm, 1983; 1.14 x
10 -7, karan & macey, 1990; 2.5 x 10 -7, mayrand &
levitt, 1983), and 1.37 x 10.6 cm 2 for the membrane area (jay, 1975), a turnover number from 2 to
6.5 x 106 urea molecules per second at 22~ is obtained. this rate is between two and three orders of
magnitude higher than that of the fastest known biological carriers (stein, 1986), and strongly suggests
a channel mechanism for urea transport.
