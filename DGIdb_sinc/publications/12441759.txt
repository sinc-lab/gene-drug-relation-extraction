objective: aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  causes specific pulmonary vasodilation for about 60 mins in patients with severe primary and
secondary pulmonary hypertension. repeated daily inhalations
are currently in use for chronic treatment. the aim of the current
study was to evaluate if phosphodiesterase type 3 and 4 inhibition
might amplify the prostanoid effect on pulmonary vasodilatation
by stabilization of intracellular second messenger cyclic  xxxd81xxx .
design: uncontrolled clinical trial.
setting: medical intensive care unit, department of internal
medicine, university hospital, giessen, germany.
patients: a total of 11 patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension (eight with primary pulmonary hypertension; one with
pulmonary hypertension associated with calcinosis, raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia
[crest syndrome]; one with pulmonary hypertension associated
with systemic lupus erythematodes, and one with chronic pulmonary
embolism) were included. all were classified as new york heart
association class iii or class iv.
interventions: during right heart catheterization, a single inhalation with  xxxd2331xxx  (1.4 ␮g per inhalation) was performed, and
hemodynamics and gas exchange variables were recorded for the

next 2.5 hrs. after the  xxxd2331xxx  effects had completely leveled off,
the dual-selective phosphodiesterase types 3 and 4 inhibitor
tolafentrine was infused in seven patients and aerosolized in five
patients at doses that were per se ineffective (80 mg per 2.5 hrs
intravenously; ~0.8 mg deposited by aerosol), followed by a
second  xxxd2331xxx  inhalation procedure.
measurements: decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance,
duration of drug effect, safety, and tolerability of combined pharmacologic intervention.
results: the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance to sole
 xxxd2331xxx  nebulization lasted for approximately 60 mins. this response was enhanced and prolonged to approximately 120 mins
in the presence of both infused and aerosolized tolafentrine,
without loss of pulmonary selectivity. no adverse events were
observed.
conclusions: these data support the principle that subthreshold selective phosphodiesterase types 3 and 4 inhibition amplifies
the lung vasodilatory response to inhaled  xxxd2331xxx , with minute
doses being sufficient via the inhalative route. (crit care med

tension (1). however, this therapy is
hampered by systemic side effects, serious infectious complications, and very
high costs. inhaled  xxxd2738xxx  is a
strictly pulmonary-selective vasodilator,
with an extremely short half-life, offered
as a screening agent for lung vasoreactivity (2). aerosolization of the long-acting
prostacyclin analogue  xxxd2331xxx  causes
strong preferential pulmonary vasodilatation in both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension (3, 4). long-term
use of nebulized  xxxd2331xxx  was noted to be
beneficial in severe primary pulmonary
hypertension and decompensated right
heart failure (5, 6) but requires 6 –12 inhalations per day to achieve sustained
relief of pulmonary hypertension, as the
drug effect levels off within ~60 mins. in

patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, we investigated whether the lung
vasodilatory response to aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  was amplified by co-application of
subthreshold doses of a new dual-selective phosphodiesterase (pde) types 3 and
4 inhibitor (tolafentrine), aiming to stabilize the second messenger cyclic  xxxd81xxx .

materials, patients, and
methods
underlying diseases were primary pulmonary hypertension (patient 1, a 52-yr-old
woman; patient 2, a 34-yr-old woman; patient
3, a 44-yr-old woman; patient 4, a 70-yr-old
woman; patient 5, a 23-yr-old man; patient 6,

inhalation of 1.4 ␮g of  xxxd2331xxx  was administered (2-min ultrasonic nebulization with the
multisonic compact aerosol mass median
aerodynamic; diameter, 3.9 ␮m (7)). after 2
hrs, tolafentrine administration was started,
either by infusion (80 mg over 2.5 hrs) or by
inhalation (total lung deposition, ~0.8 mg by
8-min ultrasonic nebulization). pilot studies
showed that tolafentrine per se at these doses
does not affect pulmonary or systemic hemodynamics. these findings were fully reproduced in this study, in which neither infusion
nor inhalation of tolafentrine had relevant influence on patient hemodynamics (as shown
in table 2, time point tolafentrine baseline). a
total of 2.5 hrs after the initial  xxxd2331xxx  inhalation, a second  xxxd2331xxx  aerosol dose (1.4 ␮g)
was administered. measurements were taken
immediately before each  xxxd2331xxx  aerosolization (baseline) and at preset intervals after
inhalation. for assessment of the overall vasodilator response, the area under the curve of
reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance
(pvr) was calculated (difference to preintervention baseline until pvr again reached 95%
of this baseline for, at most, 120 mins).

pulmonary hypertension secondary to crest
syndrome (calcinosis, raynaud phenomenon,
esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia; patient 9, a 62-yr-old woman),
systemic lupus erythematodes (patient 10, a
23-yr-old woman), and chronic pulmonary
embolism (patient 11, a 78-yr-old man). all
patients had new york heart association class
iii (n ⫽ 4) or iv (n ⫽ 7) severity, with mean
pulmonary artery pressure of ⬎50 mm hg and
cardiac index of ⬍2 l䡠min⫺1䡠m⫺2 in nearly all
cases (patient characteristics are given in table 1). moreover, all patients were receiving
chronic therapy, with repetitive inhalations of
 xxxd2331xxx  (9 –12 times daily), combined with
diuretics and anticoagulants. seven patients
entered the  xxxd2331xxx /intravenous tolafentrine
group (patients 3– 8 and 11), and five entered
the  xxxd2331xxx /aerosolized tolafentrine group
(patients 1, 2, and 9 –11). patient 11 was tested
in both groups, with a 3-mo interval.
the test protocol required right heart and
femoral artery catheterization as previously
described (5) and was approved by the justusliebig-university giessen ethics committee,
and informed consent was obtained from all
patients. after an initial 2-hr baseline period,

subgroups (intravenous tolafentrine and
aerosolized tolafentrine) are given in table 2, showing severe pulmonary hypertension and low cardiac output. accordingly, the central venous oxygen
saturation was lowered to 41.6% ⫾ 5.5%

and 10.8% ⫾ 1.1%, respectively. when
necessary, the patients received nasal oxygen to maintain arterial oxygen saturation of ⬎88%.  xxxd2331xxx  aerosolization decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure
and increased cardiac index, with a maximum decline of pvr of 30 – 40%,

whereas mean systemic arterial pressure
was virtually unaffected (fig. 1, table 2).
this pulmonary vasodilatory response
fully leveled off within approximately 60
mins figure 1.
plasma probes were sampled at discrete time points before and after tolafentrine administration. the plasma level of
tolafentrine when being infused was
318.8 ⫾ 28.8 ng/ml after reaching
steady-state conditions (30 mins after initiation of infusion); this level was virtually unchanged throughout the infusion
procedure. after cessation of inhalation
with tolafentrine, a peak plasma level of
3.4 ⫾ 1.0 ng/ml was measured. at 30
mins and 60 mins postinhalation, no
measurable amount of tolafentrine was
detected in the plasma samples. neither
tolafentrine infusion nor tolafentrine inhalation changed baseline hemodynamics, and no adverse events were reported.
however, the posttolafentrine  xxxd2331xxx  inhalation provoked an amplified decrease
in pvr and, in particular, a prolongation
of the pulmonary vasodilatory effect to
ⱖ90 mins. the area under the curve for
pvr reduction more than doubled for
both regimens of tolafentrine pretreatment.

discussion
the lung tissue is a rich source of
different phosphodiesterases, among
which pde 3 and 4 are particularly relevant for cyclic  xxxd81xxx 
degradation, thereby limiting vasodilatory effects of adenylate cyclase stimuli
such as prostanoids. moreover, as a
negative feedback loop, pde may be
up-regulated in response to increased
second-messenger levels (8). in experimental pulmonary hypertension, subthreshold doses of pde 3 and 4 inhibitors
amplified prostanoid-induced pulmonary
vasodilatation due to cyclic adenosine
monophosphate stabilization (9, 10).
these animal data were fully corroborated in the present study, testing for the
first time a potent and selective pde 3
and 4 inhibitor in patients with severe
pulmonary hypertension. being ineffective per se at the doses presently employed, both infused and aerosolized tolafentrine moderately enhanced and
markedly prolonged the pulmonary vasodilatory effect of nebulized  xxxd2331xxx , more
than doubling of the area under the curve
for pvr reduction. this effect occurred in
the absence of any significant change in

mean systemic arterial pressure or heart
rate. beyond doubt, the marked amplification of the pulmonary vasodilatory response to inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is fully attributable to the tolafentrine effect and may
not be explained by some enhanced response to the second  xxxd2331xxx  inhalation:
from previous investigations in patients
with severe pulmonary hypertension, it is
well known that the hemodynamic responses to repetitive  xxxd2331xxx  inhalations
are easily reproducible (7).
most interestingly, the minute dose of
0.8 mg of tolafentrine deposited by aerosolization (resulting in a peak plasma
level of 3.4 ⫾ 1.0 ng/ml) was equipotent
to a systemically infused dose of 80 mg
(steady-state plasma level of 318.8 ⫾ 28.8
ng/ml). this finding strongly suggests
that the nebulized pde inhibitor is
largely effective via local activity in the
lung tissue and not via a transpulmonary
passage and entry into the intravascular
compartment. this observation is particularly encouraging, as the route of inhalative pde inhibitor administration
might allow strong pulmonary phosphodiesterase inhibition in the absence of
any substantial systemic drug effect.

conclusions
we conclude that subthreshold doses
of a dual-selective pde 3 and 4 inhibitor
offer a prolongation of the pulmonary
vasodilatory response to inhaled  xxxd2331xxx 
in severe pulmonary hypertension, without loss of selectivity for the lung vasculature, and that the aerosol route of administration may be the most suitable for
this pde-inhibitor approach.
