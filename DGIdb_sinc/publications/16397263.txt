malignancies, including the vast majority of gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (gists; refs. 1, 2) and a subset of hematologic
neoplasms (3–7) and germ cell tumors (8, 9).  xxxg1279xxx  is a class iii
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  and is structurally characterized by an
extracellular domain with five immunoglobulin-like repeats, a
single transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and a
cytoplasmic  xxxg2198xxx  domain. the kinase domain consists of
the nh2-terminal ( xxxg2287xxx ) and cooh-terminal ( xxxg2287xxx   xxxg2288xxx ) lobes that are
separated by a hydrophilic kinase insert. the  xxxg2287xxx   xxxg2288xxx  domain contains
the kinase activation loop, a critical hinged region of the kinase
that must assume a particular conformation to allow full kinase
activation (10).
 xxxd2333xxx  is a potent  xxxg1279xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
(11) and is now the standard frontline therapy for advanced
gists (2, 12). although imatinib is a potent inhibitor of the kinase
activity of wild-type (wt)  xxxg1279xxx  and gist-associated juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms, most  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop
mutations are resistant to clinically achievable doses of imatinib
(2, 11–16). imatinib only binds to the inactive conformation of
 xxxg1279xxx ; however,  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations not only activate
kinase activity but also stabilize the activation loop in a
conformation that does not allow productive imatinib binding
(10, 17, 18). activating  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations are found
in association with acute myelogenous leukemia (aml; ref. 5),
mast cell disease (in particular systemic mastocytosis; refs. 4, 13),
a subset of sinonasal natural killer/t-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma
(6, 7), seminoma/dysgerminoma (8, 9), and imatinib-resistant gist
(2, 12).
 xxxd1815xxx , formerly known as  xxxd1815xxx , is an atp-competitive, dual src/abl inhibitor (19). notably,  xxxd1815xxx  can inhibit
bcr-abl activation loop mutations that are found in some chronic
myelogenous leukemia (cml) patients with acquired clinical
resistance to imatinib (20). some small-molecule src/abl inhibitors also have potency against  xxxg1279xxx  kinase (11, 14, 21, 22). therefore, we hypothesized that  xxxd1815xxx  might inhibit the kinase
activity of both wt and mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms.
we report herein that  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibits wt  xxxg1279xxx  and
juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation and kitdependent activation of downstream pathways important for
cell viability and cell survival, such as ras/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/akt, and janusactivated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
(stat). furthermore, we show that  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent inhibitor
of imatinib-resistant  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutants and induces
apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these
mutations.

abstract
activating mutations of the activation loop of  xxxg1279xxx  are
associated with certain human neoplasms, including the
majority of patients with systemic mast cell disorders, as well
as cases of seminoma, acute myelogenous leukemia (aml),
and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists). the smallmolecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2333xxx  is a
potent inhibitor of wild-type (wt)  xxxg1279xxx  and certain mutant  xxxg1279xxx 
isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating
patients with metastatic gist. however,  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop
mutations involving codon  xxxd816xxx  that are typically found in
aml, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to
 xxxd2333xxx  (ic50 > 5-10 mmol/l), and acquired  xxxg1279xxx 
activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib
mesylate resistance in gist.  xxxd1815xxx  ( formerly  xxxd1815xxx )
is a small-molecule, atp-competitive inhibitor of src and
abl tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar
range. some small-molecule src/abl inhibitors also have
potency against wt  xxxg1279xxx  kinase. therefore, we hypothesized
that  xxxd1815xxx  might inhibit the kinase activity of both wt and
mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms. we report herein that  xxxd1815xxx  potently
inhibits wt  xxxg1279xxx  and juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx 
autophosphorylation and  xxxg1279xxx -dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival,
such as ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/akt, and janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. furthermore,  xxxd1815xxx 
is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop
mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic
cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against  xxxg1279xxx 
d816y j d816f > d816v). our studies suggest that  xxxd1815xxx 
may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that
are associated with gain-of-function  xxxg1279xxx  mutations. (cancer

immunoprecipitation experiments and 75 to 200 ag protein from cell lysates
were used for whole cell protein analysis by western immunoblot assays as
previously described (28).
proliferation assays. cells were added to 96-well plates at densities
30,000 cells per well.  xxxd1815xxx  was added and proliferation was measured
at 72 hours using an 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (xtt)–based assay (roche molecular
biochemicals, indianapolis, in; ref. 11).
apoptosis assays. cells were incubated with  xxxd1815xxx  for 48 to 72 hours
and translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet
of the plasma membrane as an early indicator of apoptosis was analyzed
using an  xxxg166xxx -fitc  xxxg1279xxx  (immunotech, marseilles, france) and a
facscalibur flow cytometer loaded with cellquest analysis software
(bd, heidelberg, germany; ref. 11).
data analysis. dose-effect plots were created to calculate the ic50 for
the treatment effect of  xxxd1815xxx  for each cell line (calcusyn software
available from biosoft, cambridge, united kingdom; ref. 29).

dependent hematopoietic pro-b cell line, the chinese hamster ovary cell
line chinese hamster ovary-k1, and the murine p815 mast cell line was
obtained from the american type culture collection (atcc, manassas, va).
the murine  xxxg1279xxx  d814y mutant isoform expressed by the p815 cell line (23)
is homologous to the human  xxxg1279xxx  d816y mutation. the human
 xxxg1177xxx –dependent m-07e cell line was obtained from
dr. hal broxmeyer (department of microbiology and immunology, walther
oncology center, indiana university school of medicine, indianapolis, in).
the human hmc-1.1 mast cell line expressing a  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane
domain mutant isoform (v560g) was kindly provided by dr. butterfield
(division of allergic diseases, department of internal medicine, mayo
clinic, rochester, mn). a spontaneously occurring subclone of the hmc-1.1
cell line, hmc-1.2 (24, 25), which has an additional mutation in the
activation loop (d816v), was kindly provided by dr. akin (laboratory of
allergic diseases, national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, nih,
bethesda, md). all cell lines were grown in rpmi 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone, south logan, ut), 1%  xxxd2871xxx  (10,000
units/ml), and streptomycin (10,000 ag/mg), 2 mmol/l l-glutamine (both
life technologies-invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). filtered  xxxg1177xxx  containing
supernatant (10%) from wehi-3 cells (atcc) was added to the growth
medium for the parental ba/f3 cell line. m-07e cells were cultured using
recombinant human  xxxg526xxx 
(gm-csf) as a growth supplement as previously described (11).
site-directed mutagenesis and generation of a ba/f3 cell line
expressing mutant  xxxg1279xxx .  xxxg1279xxx  cdna was generously provided by dr. axel
ullrich (department of molecular biology, max planck institute for
biochemistry, martinsried, munich, germany) and cloned into the plxsn
retroviral vector plasmid (bd biosciences, palo alto, ca), the pcdna3.1
vector plasmid, or the m5gneo plasmid (26). site-directed mutagenesis
was used to create the d816v, d816y, d816f mutations (quickchange  xxxg1279xxx ,
stratagene, la jolla, ca) and all mutations were confirmed by bidirectional
sequencing (27). retroviral transduction was done and ba/f3 cell lines
stably expressing mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms were generated by double selection
for  xxxg418xxx  resistance and  xxxg1177xxx -independent growth (28–30).
transient transfections of cho-k1 chinese hamster cell lines with  xxxg1279xxx 
wt or mutant isoforms were done using a lipofection assay (lipofectamine  xxxg1279xxx  purchased from life technologies-invitrogen). cells were treated
with  xxxd1815xxx  24 hours after transfection (2).
antibodies and reagents. an anti- xxxg1279xxx  rabbit polyclonal antibody, an
anti-stat3 mouse monoclonal antibody (both santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca), an anti-akt (polyclonal) rabbit antibody (cell signaling
technology, beverly ma), and an anti- xxxg1366xxx /2 [extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2)] rabbit monoclonal antibody (upstate

(all from cell signaling technology). peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse
antibody and goat anti-rabbit antibody were used at 1:5,000 and 1:10,000
dilutions, respectively (bio-rad, hercules, ca). protein a/g plus-agarose
immunoprecipitation reagent was purchased from santa cruz biotechnology. the small-molecule compound  xxxd1815xxx  ( formerly  xxxd1815xxx ) was
obtained from bristol-myers squibb (princeton, nj).  xxxd2333xxx 
(sti571/gleevec) was purchased from the oregon health science university
hospital pharmacy (portland, or). imatinib and  xxxd1815xxx  were dissolved

results
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the kinase activity of wt and juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms.  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent dual
src/abl kinase inhibitor that is currently in phase i/ii clinical
studies of cml and solid tumors. based on structural homology
considerations and prior descriptions of the activity of some src
and/or abl inhibitors against  xxxg1279xxx  (11, 14, 21, 22), we hypothesized
that  xxxd1815xxx  might also inhibit  xxxg1279xxx  kinase activity. indeed,
 xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of wt  xxxg1279xxx  kinase in the cytokine-dependent human
myeloid leukemia cell line m-07e with an ic50 of 1 to 10 nmol/l.
 xxxd1815xxx  also inhibited stem cell factor (scf)–dependent
proliferation of these cells with a similar ic50 (5-10 nmol/l). in
comparison, the ic50 values for imatinib inhibition of autophosphorylation and proliferation were 50 to 100 nmol/l, respectively
(fig. 1a-b; ref. 31).  xxxd1815xxx  had little effect on the gm-csfdependent proliferation of these cells (ic50 > 10,000 nmol/l),
suggesting that the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  on scf-dependent
proliferation was due to its inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  kinase rather than
direct effects on downstream kinases (e.g., src family members)
that might be common to both the  xxxg1279xxx  and gm-csf receptors
(fig. 1b).
gain-of-function mutations involving the  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane
domain occur in some cases of mast cell disease (24) and aml (5).
in addition,  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane domain mutations are found in
approximately two thirds of gists, and this gist subset has the
best clinical response to imatinib (11, 12, 32). we tested the activity
of  xxxd1815xxx  against  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane domain mutations using
the hmc-1.1 cell line, which is a spontaneously immortalized
human mast cell leukemia cell line that expresses the  xxxg1279xxx  v560g
mutant isoform (24). this particular mutation is one of the most
common juxtamembrane domain point mutations found in gists
(2).  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the kinase activity of  xxxg1279xxx  v560g in a dosedependent manner with an ic50 of f10 nmol/l, which is nearly
identical to the previously reported results for imatinib (fig. 2a;
refs. 11, 16). imatinib potently inhibited cellular proliferation and
induced apoptosis of this cell line in the low nanomolar range
(fig. 2; ref. 11). therefore, we tested whether  xxxd1815xxx  had similar
biological effects. both  xxxd1815xxx  and imatinib inhibited cellular
proliferation of hmc-1.1 cells with an ic50 of 5 to 10 nmol/l
(fig. 2b). as shown in fig. 2c,  xxxd1815xxx  induced apoptosis of
hmc-1.1 cells with an ic50 of 14 nmol/l, whereas the ic50 for
imatinib was f70 nmol/l. these data indicate that in hmc-1.1
cells,  xxxg1279xxx  kinase activation is required for cellular proliferation

 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) inhibits wt and mutant  xxxg1279xxx 

figure 1.  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibits kinase activity of the wt  xxxg1279xxx  cell line m-07e. a, m-07e cells were treated with varying concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib
for 90 minutes before preparation of cellular lysates. immunoblotting for phosphorylated (py20 antibody) and total forms of  xxxg1279xxx  were done to evaluate the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib on  xxxg1279xxx  activation (autophosphorylation).  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation in these cells is scf dependent and both  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib inhibit
phosphorylation of  xxxg1279xxx  with ic50 values of 1 to 10 nmol/l ( xxxd1815xxx ) and 100 to 1,000 nmol/l (imatinib), respectively. b, m-07e cells were treated with  xxxd1815xxx  f
scf (100 ng/ml) or gm-csf (100 ng/ml) for 72 hours and cellular proliferation was measured using an xtt-based assay.  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the proliferation of
scf-stimulated m-07e cells with an ic50 of 5 to 10 nmol/l but  xxxd1815xxx  doses of 1,000 nmol/l had no significant effect on the gm-csf-stimulated growth of these
cells (ic50 > 10,000 nmol/l). the results from a single experiment are shown. a total of three experiments were done. points, mean of three replicates; bars, sd.

clinically relevant doses of imatinib (13). consistent with previous
studies, the ic50 of imatinib for cellular proliferation of this cell
line was >10,000 nmol/l (fig. 3a-b; refs. 13, 24).
in contrast,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the kinase activity of  xxxg1279xxx  v560g/
d816v in a dose-dependent manner with an ic50 of 50 to 100 nmol/
l. despite inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  kinase activity by  xxxd1815xxx  in the low
nanomolar range, the compound was nearly 1 log less potent for
inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis,
with ic50 values of 1,200 and 2,000 nmol/l, respectively (fig. 3a-c).
these results suggest that hmc-1.2 cells are less dependent on  xxxg1279xxx 
kinase activity for cellular proliferation and survival than the
parental hmc-1.1 cells, possibly due to other oncogenic events
that occurred during the emergence of this subclone.
we tested the activity of  xxxd1815xxx  against the spontaneously
occurring murine mastocytosis cell line, p815, which expresses a murine  xxxg1279xxx  d814y mutation that is homologous to the human d816y
mutation.  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation
with an ic50 of 1 to 10 nmol/l and inhibited the cellular proliferation
and induced apoptosis of p815 cells with ic50 values of 10 to 25 and
f25 nmol/l, respectively (fig. 3d-f). therefore, unlike our results
with the hmc-1.2 cells,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  kinase in p815

and survival and  xxxd1815xxx  is at least as potent as imatinib for
inhibiting the  xxxg1279xxx  v560g juxtamembrane domain mutation.
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the kinase activity of imatinib-resistant
 xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations found in hematologic malignancies. although imatinib potently inhibits the kinase activity of
wt and juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms, it has
minimal activity against  xxxg1279xxx  d816y, d816f, or d816v mutant
kinases (13). the inability of imatinib to inhibit these mutant
isoforms is due to steric clash between imatinib and the ‘‘open’’
(or active) conformation of the  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop (19, 20). the
predicted structural model of  xxxd1815xxx  binding to abl suggests
that changes in activation loop conformation might not significantly affect drug binding (19). we hypothesized that  xxxd1815xxx 
would also be less sensitive to the  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop conformational changes than imatinib and, therefore,  xxxd1815xxx  would more
potently inhibit  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations involving codon 816.
to test this hypothesis, we used a spontaneously generated subclone of the hmc-1.1 cell line hmc-1.2, which acquired the typical
mastocytosis-associated d816v mutation on the same allele as the
original v560g mutation (24, 25).  xxxg1279xxx  is constitutively autophosphorylated in this cell line but is resistant to treatment with

figure 2.  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibits kinase activity of a  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane domain mutation (v560g). the human mast cell line hmc-1.1 was treated with varying
concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib. the potency of the reagents was evaluated by sequentially immunoblotting for phosphorylated and total forms of  xxxg1279xxx  (a),
an xtt-based assay to assess inhibition of cellular proliferation (b), and a flow cytometry–based assay to assess induction of apoptosis (c ). both  xxxd1815xxx  and imatinib
potently inhibited  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation and cell proliferation. in addition, both agents potently induced apoptosis. representative experimental results from a total
of three experiments. columns (b ), mean of three replicates; bars, sd. the dose-effect plots in (b ) and (c ) show the computed ic50 for the experimental results

of the  xxxg1279xxx  d816y mutation was significantly lower (ic50 1-10
nmol/l; fig. 4a).
in comparison, imatinib in doses of up to 10,000 nmol/l did not
significantly inhibit  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation in d816v and d816f
cells. however, d816y cells were moderately sensitive to imatinib
therapy with doses of >1,000 nmol/l but <10,000 nmol/l completely inhibit  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation (fig. 4b). these findings
are in agreement with our results for the murine p815 (d814y) cell
line shown in fig. 3d-f.
 xxxd1815xxx  is 1 log more potent against wt or juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms than activation loop
mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms. our results suggested that  xxxd1815xxx  was
less active against  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutant isoforms than
against wt or juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx . however, we
were unable to directly compare this in our isogenic ba/f3 system,
as we could not establish an  xxxg1177xxx -independent cell line expressing
wt or juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx . thus, we could not
directly compare wt  xxxg1279xxx  to activation loop mutant  xxxg1279xxx  in the

cells was strongly correlated with inhibition of cellular proliferation
and induction of apoptosis. notably, high-dose imatinib (>1,000
nmol/l) inhibited  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation. a dose of 1,200 nmol/l
imatinib inhibited the proliferation of p815 cells by 30% but did not
significantly induce programmed cell death.
effects of different amino acid substitutions of  xxxg1279xxx  aspartic
acid 816 ( xxxd816xxx ) on sensitivity to  xxxd1815xxx . our results with the
hmc-1.2 and p815 cell lines suggested that  xxxd1815xxx  might have
different potency against d816y than against d816v mutations.
alternatively, these results could reflect differences in activity of
 xxxd1815xxx  against human or murine  xxxg1279xxx  and/or differences in
drug uptake by the different cell lines. to address this issue, we
generated isogenic factor–independent ba/f3 cell lines expressing
systemic mastocytosis–associated codon 816 mutations with an
interchange of  xxxd233xxx  to valine (d816v), tyrosine (d816y),
or phenylalanine (d816f).  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the autophosphorylation of human  xxxg1279xxx  d816v and d816f with an ic50 of f100
nmol/l. however, the ic50 for inhibition of autophosphorylation

 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) inhibits wt and mutant  xxxg1279xxx 

kinase by  xxxd1815xxx  on the activation status of  xxxg1279xxx -dependent
downstream signaling pathways, including mapk, akt, and stat3.
figure 5 shows representative western blots for factor-independent
ba/f3 cells expressing human  xxxg1279xxx  d816v, d816f, or d816y mutations. for comparison, we also analyzed the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  of
activation of  xxxg1366xxx /2, akt, and stat3 in hmc-1.1, hmc-1.2, and
p815 cells.  xxxg1366xxx /2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2), stat3, and akt are constitutively
activated in these cells. the phosphorylation of stat3 and  xxxg1366xxx 
was potently and completely inhibited in  xxxd1815xxx -treated baf3
d816v/y/f cells with ic50 values that were similar to those required
for inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation. stat3 activation was
potently but incompletely inhibited in  xxxd1815xxx -treated p815 and
hmc-1.2 cells. in contrast to the other cell lines, stat3 activation
was only minimally inhibited in  xxxd1815xxx -treated hmc-1.1 cells.
akt activation was potently but incompletely inhibited in all tested
cell lines using  xxxd1815xxx  doses of 10 to 1,000 nmol/l. similarly,
 xxxg1366xxx  activation was also less potently inhibited than  xxxg1366xxx 
(fig. 5). notably,  xxxd1815xxx -induced inhibition of proliferation and
induction of apoptosis are strongly correlated with inhibiting the
activation of  xxxg1279xxx , mapk ( xxxg1366xxx  >  xxxg1366xxx ), and akt. in contrast,

which we transiently transfected cho-k1 cells with expression
vectors encoding wt or mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms. transfected cells
were treated with  xxxd1815xxx  and biochemically analyzed as
described above. consistent with our previous results,  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibited the autophosphorylation of scf-stimulated wt  xxxg1279xxx 
(analogous to m-07ee) or juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx 
(analogous to the mutation in hmc-1.1) with an ic50 of 1 to 10
nmol/l, whereas the ic50 for inhibition of autophosphorylation of
the  xxxg1279xxx  d816v and d816h mutations [reported in <5% of systemic
mastocytosis (33) and 7% of seminoma cases (8)] was f100 to 500
nmol/l (fig. 4c). some lane-to-lane variation in total  xxxg1279xxx 
expression is apparent in fig. 4; such differences are partially
attributable to variations in efficiency of immunoprecipitation
between experimental conditions and also to the previously
described inverse association between kinase activation and
protein degradation (i.e.,  xxxg1279xxx  turnover is increased when the
kinase is activated; ref. 34).
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits  xxxg1279xxx -dependent activation of downstream
signaling pathways. we studied the effects of inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx

(murine  xxxg1279xxx  d814y; d-f ) cells were treated with varying concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib as described above. the potency of the reagents was evaluated
by sequentially immunoblotting for phosphorylated and total forms of  xxxg1279xxx  (a and d ), an xtt-based assay to assess inhibition of cellular proliferation (b and e),
and a flow cytometry-based assay of apoptosis induction (c and f ). representative experimental results from a total of three. columns (b and e ), mean of

cells need an f1 log higher concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis compared with the concentration required to inhibit  xxxg1279xxx 
autophosphorylation. d to f, p815:  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited autophosphorylation of  xxxg1279xxx  and consequently lead to inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of
apoptosis. in contrast, high-dose imatinib (1,000 nmol/l) partially inhibited the autophosphorylation of d814y but had only a moderate inhibitory effect on cellular
proliferation and did not induce apoptosis in the tested dose range.

y cells or transiently transfected cho-k1 cells expressing wt  xxxg1279xxx  or mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms were treated with varying concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib for
90 minutes. in addition, scf ligand was added to cells transfected with the wt  xxxg1279xxx  construct. protein lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated using an
anti- xxxg1279xxx  antibody and/or sequentially immunoblotted using antibodies to phosphorylated tyrosine residues (p-tyr) total  xxxg1279xxx  (a). in (b and c), protein lysates (200 ag)
were directly immunoblotted using antibodies to p-tyr or  xxxg1279xxx . representative experimental results from a total of three. a,  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited the
autophosphorylation of mutant  xxxg1279xxx  with ic50 values of f250 to 100 nmol/l (d816v), 10 to 100 nmol/l (d816f), and 1 to 10 nmol/l (d816y). b,  xxxd1815xxx  potently
inhibited the autophosphorylation of mutant  xxxg1279xxx  isoforms in the same dose range as shown in (a). in contrast, imatinib had no significant effect on autophosphorylation
of d816v or d816f. however, high-dose imatinib (10,000 nmol/l) inhibited the autophosphorylation of d816y. c,  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited scf-induced
phosphorylation of wt  xxxg1279xxx  with an ic50 of f1 to 10 nmol/l. autophosphorylation of the v560d juxtamembrane domain mutation was inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx  with an
ic50 of f10 nmol/l, and the activation loop mutations d816v and d816h were inhibited with ic50 values in the range of 100 to 500 nmol/l.

isogenic cells expressing  xxxg1279xxx   xxxd816xxx  f/v/y. consistent with the
results of our biochemical studies,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the proliferation of ba/f3  xxxg1279xxx  d816v and d816f cells with an ic50 of
100 to 150 nmol/l, and ba/f3  xxxg1279xxx  d816y cells with an ic50 of
5 nmol/l. in contrast, imatinib had no significant inhibitory
effect on the growth of these three cell lines (ic50 > 10,000 nmol/l;
fig. 6a).  xxxd1815xxx  also potently induced apoptosis of the ba/f3  xxxg1279xxx 
d816v and d816f cell lines with calculated ic50 values of 220 and
120 nmol/l, respectively. the ic50 for induction of apoptosis of the
ba/f3 d816y cell line was 20 nmol/l (fig. 6b). therefore,  xxxd1815xxx 
was at least 1 log more potent against  xxxg1279xxx  d816y than against  xxxg1279xxx 
d816v/f. addition of murine  xxxg1177xxx  (5 ng/ml) to ba/f3 d816v cells
prevented  xxxd1815xxx -induced apoptosis [77% viable cells when cultured with  xxxd1815xxx  1000 nmol/l +  xxxg1177xxx  versus 0.1% viable cells when

loop in the active conformation, thus preventing imatinib binding
(e.g., v379i, l387m, and h396r; ref. 38). structural studies of the
 xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine class of dual src-abl inhibitors show
that these compounds also bind to the atp-binding site in abl but
without regard for the position of the activation loop, which can be
in either the active or inactive conformation (19, 21, 22, 35). notably,
these compounds can inhibit the kinase activity of certain imatinibresistant bcr-abl activation loop mutant isoforms. based on these
observations, shah et al. (20) profiled the activity of  xxxd1815xxx  against
a panel of cell lines expressing wt or imatinib-resistant bcr-abl.
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the kinase activity of 14 of 15 imatinib-resistant
bcr-abl mutants, including all tested activation loop mutants.
thus,  xxxd1815xxx  is predicted to bind to the atp-binding site of bcrabl irrespective of the conformation of the activation loop (20).
gain-of-function point mutations of the  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop are
associated with certain human neoplasms, including systemic mast
cell disorders (13, 33), aml (5), seminoma/dysgerminoma (8, 39),
and gist (both primary and imatinib-resistant gist; refs. 12, 40).
in the case of mast cell disorders, seminoma, and aml, the most
frequent  xxxg1279xxx  mutation is the replacement of the normal aspartic
acid residue at codon 816 of the activation loop with a valine
residue (d816v). the d816v mutation results in constitutive
activation of  xxxg1279xxx  kinase activity and is predicted to help stabilize
the activation loop in the active conformation. in addition to
d816v, other mutations involving codon 816 have been reported
in systemic mast cell disorders (d816y and d816f; refs. 13, 33),

discussion
crystal structures of imatinib bound to the kinase domains of abl
or  xxxg1279xxx  indicate that imatinib binds to the atp-binding site of these
kinases only when the activation loop of the kinase is in the inactive
or ‘‘closed’’ conformation (17, 18, 35–37). one mechanism of acquired
resistance to imatinib in cml is the development of mutations of
the bcr-abl activation loop that stabilize the kinase activation

 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) inhibits wt and mutant  xxxg1279xxx 

minority of cases of systemic mastocytosis (33) and aml (5, 44).
 xxxd1815xxx  also potently inhibits  xxxg1279xxx  juxtamembrane domain
mutations with an ic50 of 1 to 10 nmol/l. notably,  xxxd1815xxx  had
similar potency to imatinib for inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation and cellular proliferation in a mast cell line expressing
juxtamembrane domain mutant  xxxg1279xxx  (hmc-1.1) and was even more
potent than imatinib for inducing apoptosis of this cell line.
 xxxd1815xxx  is a much more potent inhibitor of  xxxg1279xxx  activation
loop mutants than imatinib, with ic50 values for inhibition of
autophosphorylation of  xxxg1279xxx   xxxd816xxx  mutants in the range of 10 to
100 nmol/l. interestingly, the potency of the  xxxd1815xxx  against  xxxg1279xxx 
kinase is differentially influenced by various activation loop
mutations. notably,  xxxg1279xxx  d816y is 10-fold more sensitive to
 xxxd1815xxx  than  xxxg1279xxx  d816v/f. in addition,  xxxg1279xxx  d816f is f2-fold
more sensitive to  xxxd1815xxx  compared with  xxxg1279xxx  d816v.
our results suggest that the conformation of the  xxxg1279xxx  activation
loop does influence  xxxd1815xxx  potency, perhaps due to secondary
changes in the atp-binding pocket that influence drug binding.
alternatively, the different activation loop mutations might have

aml (d816y; refs. 5, 41), and/or seminomas (d816y and d816h;
refs. 8, 9, 42). consistent with the structural model of imatinib
binding to  xxxg1279xxx , the kinase activity of all of these mutants is
resistant to imatinib (2, 8, 13).
based on previous reports of the activity of some small-molecule
compounds against  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations (21, 43) and
specifically, of some src and/or abl inhibitors against  xxxg1279xxx  (19), we
hypothesized that  xxxd1815xxx  might also inhibit the kinase activity
of  xxxg1279xxx . in our studies, we found  xxxd1815xxx  to be a potent inhibitor
of wt  xxxg1279xxx  with an ic50 for inhibition of autophosphorylation and
cellular proliferation of 5 to 10 nmol/l. in comparison, the ic50 for
inhibition of autophosphorylation and proliferation in these same
cells by imatinib was 10- to 20-fold higher (f100 nmol/l; ref. 11).
the ic50 for  xxxd1815xxx  inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  autophosphorylation
that we obtained using cell-based assays of full-length  xxxg1279xxx  is very
similar to that reported by lombardo et al. (19) using cell-free
assays of kinase domain–only recombinant  xxxg1279xxx  enzyme.
juxtamembrane domain mutations of  xxxg1279xxx  are commonly
associated with human gists (summarized in ref. 12) and a

p- xxxg1366xxx /2) and total forms of stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx /2. downstream pathways affecting phosphorylation of akt, stat3, and mapks were activated in all
untreated cell lines. treatment with  xxxd1815xxx  lead to a marked decrease in the concentration of activated forms of stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx /2.

were treated with  xxxd1815xxx , imatinib, or vehicle only for 48 to 72 hours before measuring cellular proliferation using an xtt-based assay (a ), or apoptosis using an
 xxxg166xxx / xxxd3027xxx  iodide flow cytometry–based assay (b ). representative experiment results from a total of three. columns (a ), average of three replicates;
bars, sd. the dose-effect plots indicate the computed ic50 for the experiments shown immediately to the left of the plot. a,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the proliferation of ba/f3
 xxxg1279xxx  d816v/f/y cells with ic50 values of 150 nmol/l (d816v), 100 nmol/l (d816f), and 5 nmol/l (d816y), respectively. in contrast, imatinib had little or no
antiproliferative effects using doses of up to 10,000 nmol/l. b,  xxxd1815xxx  potently induced apoptosis in ba/f3  xxxg1279xxx  d816v/f/y cells with ic50 values of 220 nmol/l
(d816v), 120 nmol/l (d816f), and 15 nmol/l (d816y), respectively. in contrast, 1,000 nmol/l imatinib did not induce apoptosis of any of these cell lines.

ary oncogenic events, which developed during the prolonged cell
passaging that gave rise to this cell line, are responsible for the
apparent ‘‘disconnect’’ between inhibiting  xxxg1279xxx  kinase and effects
on cellular proliferation and survival.
 xxxd1815xxx  is currently in phase i/ii trials for cml. based on the
preliminary reports of these studies, it seems that this drug is safe,
well tolerated, and efficacious in the setting of imatinib-resistant
cml (47). the pharmacokinetic data from these trials indicate that
drug levels required to inhibit  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations shown
in the present studies can be safely achieved in the systemic
circulation of patients. based on our studies, we predict that
 xxxd1815xxx  would have biological and clinical activity against
human diseases associated with  xxxg1279xxx  activation loop mutations,
including systemic mastocytosis (33), aml (5, 44),  xxxd1709xxx -resistant/
refractory (39), seminoma/dysgerminoma (8, 9), and imatinibresistant gist (12).

differential abilities to stabilize the activation loop in the active
conformation and prevent  xxxg1279xxx  from assuming an inactive kinase
conformation that has higher  xxxd1815xxx -binding affinity. this
hypothesis is supported by our observation that imatinib is more
potent against d816y than against d816v/f. further structural
studies are needed to explain these experimental results and to
compare the  xxxd1815xxx  liganded structures of  xxxg1279xxx  and abl.
in our studies, inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  kinase in hmc-1.1 (human
mastocytosis) and p815 (murine mastocytosis) resulted in inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis. this
suggests that therapeutic inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx  kinase would be
effective for human mastocytosis that is associated with  xxxg1279xxx   xxxd816xxx 
mutations. there are other lines of evidence to support this
hypothesis: (a)  xxxg1279xxx  kinase inhibition is developmentally required
for mast cell formation (1, 3, 4); (b) imatinib-induced inhibition
of an alternative oncogenic kinase (fip1l1- xxxg1709xxx ) results in
marked clinical responses in variant systemic mastocytosis
associated with this genomic alteration (45); (c) inhibition of  xxxg1279xxx 
d816v by the kinase inhibitor  xxxd2642xxx  resulted in hematologic and
clinical improvement in a patient with mast cell leukemia (46).
it should be noted that the hmc-1.2 cell line (human mastocytosis with  xxxg1279xxx  v560g/d816v) was less sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd1815xxx .  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited  xxxg1279xxx 
in these cells but this seemed to be insufficient to inhibit cellular
proliferation or induce apoptosis. we speculate that other second-
