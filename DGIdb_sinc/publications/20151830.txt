resistance to thyroid hormone in a patient
with coexisting graves’ disease
tharsan sivakumar and sushela chaidarun

background: resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a rare disorder in which an abnormality in the binding
domain of the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  results in end-organ insensitivity to the actions of thyroid hormones.
this disorder is sometimes misdiagnosed as graves’ disease due to the presence of a goiter with high iodine-123
thyroid uptake and high levels of total and free thyroid hormones. additionally, some patients with rth may
experience palpitations or tachycardia. there is a previous report of a patient with pituitary rth and concurrent
graves’ disease.
summary: we describe a patient who was found to have a goiter with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism
by his primary care physician. work-up revealed a low  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh), high thyroidstimulating immunoglobulins, high iodine-123 thyroid uptake, as well as increased homogenous activity in both
thyroid glands on nuclear scan and a suppressed tsh. diagnosis of graves’ disease was made, and the patient
underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland. the patient subsequently developed hypothyroidism and
required a much higher dose of levothyroxine than his weight-based estimate of a full replacement dose to
maintain euthyroidism. on 325 mg of daily levothyroxine the patient was clinically euthyroid and had a normal
tsh although his levels of t3 and t4 were high. work-up revealed a mutation in the thyroid hormone betareceptor gene, consistent with diagnosis of rth.
conclusions: rth is often misdiagnosed as graves’ disease. however, these disorders can coexist, and the
concurrent presence of both disorders in a patient can present diagnostic challenges. a previous report of a
patient with graves’ disease associated with rth was published before gene sequencing could be used to
confirm diagnosis of rth. we present a patient with graves’ disease and concurrent rth that was confirmed by
gene sequencing, showing a mutation in the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  b gene.

introduction

g

raves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder in which
hyperthyroidism results from excessive stimulation of
the thyroid gland by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
(tsis). tsis bind to and activate  xxxd3368xxx  receptors causing
growth of the thyroid gland, as well as increased synthesis of
thyroid hormone by thyroid follicles.
thyroid hormones act on the carboxy-terminal domain of
thyroid receptors (trs) that belong to the family of steroid
nuclear receptors. trs bind to thyroid response elements that
are located in the promoter regions of target genes. the two
subtypes of trs, tra and trb, are encoded by genes on
chromosomes 17 and 13, respectively (1).
first described by refetoff et al. in 1967, resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a disorder in which there is reduced
end-organ sensitivity to thyroid hormones (2). this is usually
due to mutations in the trb, but may also occur due to thy-

roid hormone cell membrane transporters or genes controlling the intracellular metabolism of thyroid hormone (1). this
results in the reduced clinical and biochemical manifestations
of thyroid hormone action relative to levels of the circulating hormones. three forms of rth have been described, including pituitary resistance ( xxxg2284xxx ), generalized resistance
( xxxg2284xxx ), and peripheral rth (perrth). the classification of
 xxxg2284xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx  is somewhat arbitrary, as these two disorders may fall along a clinical spectrum of disease, and a wide
overlap of signs and symptoms exhibited by individuals with
 xxxg2284xxx  or  xxxg2284xxx  is reported (3). also, different clinical features
have been observed in affected individuals in the same kindred having the same thyroid hormone beta-receptor mutation. moreover, identical mutations have been identified in
unrelated kindreds classified as  xxxg2284xxx  or  xxxg2284xxx . this supports the view that  xxxg2284xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx  are variable manifestations of a single genetic entity. the pathophysiology of
perrth is less well understood.

because patients with rth may present with a goiter,
palpitations, and elevated thyroid hormones, they are frequently misdiagnosed as having graves’ disease (1). this
often leads to inappropriate medical investigations and
treatment (1,4).
although graves’ disease is a commonly encountered
thyroid disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.8%, rth is
a rare disease with a prevalence of only 1 in 40,000 (5,6). in a
previous report, one patient with graves’ disease was found
to have concurrent pituitary rth (7). this was published
before gene sequencing could be used to confirm diagnosis of
rth. we present a patient with graves’ disease and concurrent rth that was confirmed by gene sequencing, showing a
mutation in the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  b gene.
patient findings
a 53-year-old caucasian male was found to have a goiter
on routine evaluation by his primary care physician. the
patient reported an increased appetite, as well as weight loss
and anxiety for several preceding months. thyroid function
tests (tfts) showed a low  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh)
and elevated levels of t3, t4, and free thyroxine index (table
1, column 1). repeat testing confirmed these results. the
patient was found to have an elevated tsi (143%; reference
range <130%), and an iodine-123 (i-123) uptake was found to
be 40% (reference range 5–15%) at 6 hours with homogenous
activity throughout both lobes of the thyroid gland which
appeared slightly prominent. he was also found to have antimicrosomal antibodies 101.5 u=ml (reference range <1) and
antithyroglobulin antibodies 1.6 u=ml (reference range <1).
graves’ disease was diagnosed in the patient based on his
symptoms of hyperthyroidism, depressed tsh, high t3 and
t4 levels, and elevated tsi. he underwent ablation of the
thyroid gland with 10 mcu of iodine-131 and subsequently
developed hypothyroidism in the following months. table 1,
column 2 shows his tfts 6 months postablation. the patient
was initially started on levothyroxine ( xxxd2750xxx ) 25 mg daily, which
was increased over the next few months. he required titration
to high doses of  xxxd2750xxx  to achieve clinical euthyroidism and
normalization of tsh levels. table 2, rows 1–3 show his tfts
on 250, 300, and 325 mcg of  xxxd2750xxx , respectively. his increased
levels of t4 and t3 despite the normal tsh levels at the higher
doses raised the question of rth.
the patient underwent genetic testing and was found to
have a thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  b gene mutation g347w. a
guanine to thymine base substitution at nucleotide position
1339 which altered codon-347 from glycine (ggg) to tryptophan (tgg) was identified. genetic testing of the patient’s
mother and his son showed that neither of them carried this

mutation. the patient’s son also had normal results on routine
tfts. the patient’s father was deceased and could not be tested.
currently, the patient has been clinically euthyroid on a
stable dose of 325 mg of daily levothyroxine with a tsh of
1.29miu=ml.
discussion
rth is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner
(8). thus, the lack of the mutation in the patient’s mother
indicates that either he inherited the gene from his father or
this represents a de novo mutation, which is found in 22.5% of
patients with rth (1). affected individuals are heterozygous
for mutations and this may explain why his son did not carry
the mutation. in all, 122 different point or frameshift mutations clustered in three regions in the trb gene have been
found to be associated with rth (9). one region encompasses
codons 310–347 (10). genetic testing of our patient revealed
that he possessed the trb gene mutation g347w as described.
in addition to tsi, the patient also had elevated antimicrosomal antibodies. a number of reports exist in which
rth has been associated with thyroid autoimmunity, mainly
hashimoto’s thyroiditis (11,12,13). one report suggests that
patients with rth with high titers of antithyroid antibodies
are more likely to require thyroid hormone supplementation
(13). however, considering the high prevalence of thyroid
autoimmunity, particularly hashimoto’s thyroiditis, it is expected that some rare patients will have autoimmune hypothyroidism coexisting with rth.
graves’ disease is one of the most prevalent autoimmune
diseases with an estimated prevalence of 0.8% in the united
states (6,13). considering a prevalence of 1 in 40,000 for rth,
it might be expected that 1 in 5,000,000 people in the united
states will have coexisting graves’ disease and rth. one
previous report exists describing a patient with pituitary rth
and concurrent graves’ disease (7). however, at that time of
the publication by pillay et al., genetic testing for trb gene
mutations was not available, and thus the diagnosis of rth
was confirmed only by thyroid releasing hormone (trh)
stimulation testing.
graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and is relatively straightforward to diagnose. considering the relative prevalence of graves’ disease, and the
rarity of rth, patients with rth are often misdiagnosed as
having graves’ disease (1,4). this is due to the fact that patients with either disorder may have a goiter, tachycardia or
palpitations, high levels of total and free thyroid hormone
levels, and increased i-123 uptake on nuclear scan of the
thyroid gland. this misdiagnosis has been reported to result
in various inappropriate treatments (4,15,16). thus, it is important to differentiate between these two disorders.
evidence for the existence of graves’ disease in our patient
is given by the presence of signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism along with elevated thyroid tsis and high levels
of t3 and t4 and a suppressed tsh this combination of
findings would not be present in isolated rth.
following radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland,
the patient’s levothyroxine dose was progressively increased
over the next few years as he continued to exhibit both signs of
hypothyroidism as well as an elevated tsh level. table 2,
row 1 shows that while taking 250 mg of  xxxd2750xxx , he continued to
have an elevated tsh, despite high levels of t3 and t4. at this

point, medication noncompliance, impaired absorption of
thyroid hormone supplementation, and increased metabolism of thyroid hormone can be excluded because the patient
had high levels of t3 and t4. this raised the possibility of
rth, which was later demonstrated on genetic testing.
the number of years that elapsed before the diagnosis of
rth was established in our patient shows how challenging
this diagnosis can be to render, especially if it occurs in the
setting of concurrent graves’ disease. in his initial tfts (table
1, column 1), his tsh is only slightly suppressed in the setting
of notably high total t3 levels and free thyroxine index. this is
perhaps the first clue that the patient had rth in addition to
graves’ disease. as patients with rth vary in clinical spectrum, the level of thyroid hormones required to suppress their
tsh cannot be precisely defined. patients with rth may have
thyroid hormone supplementation at doses two to three times
larger than usual replacement doses without producing suppression of tsh or clinical hyperthyroidism. however, very
large doses of levothyroxine (330–900 mg daily) or liothyronine
(100–500 mg daily) can partially or completely suppress pituitary tsh response to trh and i-131 uptake by the thyroid
gland (4). the clinical hyperthyroidism experienced by our
patient due to graves’ disease was likely abated by his concurrent rth, resulting in only minimal suppression of tsh.
diagnosis of rth is suggested by normal to elevated tsh
along with elevated serum free t3 and t4 levels in the absence
of clinical features of hyperthyroidism. a suspicion of inappropriate tsh secretion should be raised if the tsh and
free t3 and t4 levels are all elevated in the setting of clinical
hyperthyroidism. if this occurs a tsh a-subunit level and
pituitary mri or pituitary scintigraphy with radiolabeled
octreotide (octreoscan) can be ordered to rule out a tshsecreting pituitary adenoma, most of which present as macroadenomas (17). also, in rth, patients have a normal or
supranormal increase in tsh following trh administration,
whereas in tsh-secreting adenomas, trh stimulation fails to
cause more than a twofold rise in tsh secretion (17).
features that both graves’ disease and rth share include
elevated free thyroid hormone levels, increased iodine uptake
on thyroid nuclear scan, and the presence of a goiter and
palpitations or tachycardia. stigmata specific to graves’ disease such as exopthalmous and pretibial myxedema should
not be present in a patient with isolated rth, nor should one
find elevated levels of tsi. because rth is usually inherited in

test

result

an autosomal dominant manner, a family history may be
helpful. considering that patients with rth are often mistaken as having graves’ disease, the family history may reveal
that a number of family members have undergone inappropriate treatment after a misdiagnosis of graves’ disease or
hyperthyroidism. also, because the thyroid hormone b receptor has been sequenced and numerous mutations resulting
in the rth phenotype are known, genetic testing can aid in
distinguishing graves’ disease from rth. a trb mutation
can be found in 90% of patients with rth (17). first-degree
family members of patients harboring a known mutation
should be genetically screened as well, to prevent potential
misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.
because patients with rth are often misdiagnosed as
having graves’ disease, many of them will undergo radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland or thyroidectomy
which will necessitate subsequent thyroid hormone supplementation. patients who require supplementation at much
higher doses than calculated weight-based estimates to
maintain clinical euthyroidism after ablation or those who
continue to have elevated tsh levels despite high doses of
supplementation should undergo trh stimulation and genetic testing for rth.
clearly, our patient’s clinical investigations and findings
are consistent with a diagnosis of graves’ disease with coexisting rth. although there was evidence of rth even on the
patient’s initial tfts, this diagnosis did not become apparent until after radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid
gland when the confounding effects of graves’ disease were
eliminated. our patient illustrates some of the difficulties
encountered in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction, particularly for the combination of rare rth with coexisting
graves’ disease. it also highlights the importance of critically
evaluating tfts in association with clinical findings for clues
regarding concurrent disorders.
