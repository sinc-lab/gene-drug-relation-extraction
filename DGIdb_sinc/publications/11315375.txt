background. in recent years, dental
practitioners have relied on ibuprofen and
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, or nsaids—such as naproxen,
 xxxd1882xxx  and  xxxd2423xxx —to manage
acute and chronic orofacial pain. two
nsaids that recently came on the
market, celecoxib and rofecoxib, have been
developed to limit the adverse effects seen
after chronic use of nsaids.

conclusions. although peripherally
acting analgesics are remarkably effective,
chronic administration of nonselective
cox inhibitors has been associated with
gastrointestinal ulceration and prolonged
bleeding. the authors present the distinctive mechanism of action for these new
cox-2 inhibitors, compare their relative

also summarize indications, contraindications and dosing recommendations.
clinical implications. celecoxib and
rofecoxib are valuable dental therapeutic
agents for the management of inflammatory joint disorders and associated chronic
orofacial pain. additionally, rofecoxib,
with its more rapid onset, may be useful
in treating selected cases of acute postsurgical pain.

reportedly requiring hospitalization in 0.5 to
1.0 percent of chronic nsaid users.4 a
greater risk of toxicity with chronic use of
the nsaids is reported among geriatric
patients.2,5
the adverse effects seen with chronic
nsaid use may occur less frequently with
two recently introduced anti-inflammatory
analgesic agents, celecoxib (celebrex, pharmacia/pfizer) and rofecoxib (vioxx, merck &
co. inc.). known as cyclo-oxygenase-2, or
cox-2, inhibitors, and also as cox1–sparing drugs, these newer nsaids have
been developed to limit the adverse effects

they may provide dental practitioners with an
important and valuable alternative therapy for
the management of chronic joint pain and, in
selected cases, the treatment of acute postoperative pain.
the cyclo-oxygenase mechanism

nsaids appear to induce analgesia and to reduce
fever and inflammation through a shared biochemical mechanism. all of the agents in this
drug class block the production of various mediators of inflammation, including prostaglandins,
prostacyclins and thromboxanes.6,7 the inflammatory process that occurs after tissue injury is
mediated, in part, by the breakdown of damaged
cell membranes by phospholipase-a2 into their
fatty acid components. one of these  xxxd2154xxx ,
 xxxd208xxx , then is converted into prostaglandins, prostacyclins and thromboxanes by various cox enzymes (figure). prostaglandins prob452

ably are the most important of these hyperalgesic
and inflammatory mediators. by sensitizing nerve
ending to bradykinins and histamines, prostaglandins enhance the pain and tenderness of
inflammation. additionally, elevated tissue concentrations of prostaglandins are responsible for
initiating the vasodilation seen clinically as erythema and edema. on the other hand, other
prostanoids synthesized by cox enzymes, such as
prostacyclins and thromboxanes, are responsible
for maintaining healthy gastric mucosa, proper
renal profusion and normal platelet activation.
inhibition of cox enzymes, therefore, is responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of nsaids
and the adverse effects reported for these drugs.2,6
two forms of the cox enzymes have been identified: cox-1 and cox-2.8 the cox-1 enzyme is
present in tissue at all times and is responsible
for synthesizing prostanoids that have cytoprotective functions. the cox-1 enzymes regulate
normal cell activities in the stomach and kidneys,

adverse reactions and

damage to the gi tract—including erosions,
ulcers and bleeding—is a known adverse reaction
to the prolonged use of most nsaids. the relative risk of ibuprofen administered at a dosage of
1,600 mg per day has been found to be lower than
454

jada, vol. 132, april 2001

that of other nsaids such as  xxxd1882xxx , aspirin,
naproxen and  xxxd2423xxx .3,21 endoscopic studies
have found that higher doses of ibuprofen—2,400
mg per day—are more likely to cause gi damage
than are lower doses.19,20
fewer gi ulcers appear with either celecoxib or
rofecoxib than with prescription doses of ibuprofen or naproxen. a recently published multicenter
clinical trial of celecoxib (400 mg twice per day),
ibuprofen (800 mg three times per day) and

c l i n i c a l

diclofenac (75 mg twice per day) compared gi toxicity after long-term use for osteoarthritis and
rheumatoid arthritis.22 nearly 8,000 adults were
enrolled in this prospective study, which lasted up
to six months. compared with ibuprofen and
diclofenac, celecoxib induced fewer upper gi
symptoms and complications.22 bombardier and
colleagues23 published a similar large long-term
evaluation of rofecoxib. in their study, adult
patients who had rheumatoid arthritis received
either rofecoxib 50 mg per day or naproxen 500
mg twice per day. the researchers assessed confirmed clinical upper gi events. they found that
rofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy for
treating rheumatoid arthritis, and that confirmed
gi events occurred half as often with rofecoxib as
with naproxen.23
although the gi toxicity of these agents is
reduced, reports of abdominal pain, diarrhea and
dyspepsia associated with their use still occur.
although these new cox-2 inhibitors appear to
be safer than traditional nsaids, life-threatening
and fatal ulcer complications have been reported
with them. unlike low-dose aspirin, the cox-2
inhibitors are not indicated for chronic prophylaxis to prevent myocardial infarctions. in the
recently published long-term toxicity study comparing rofecoxib to naproxen, myocardial infarctions occurred less frequently in patients taking
the nonselective cox inhibitor naproxen.23
whether this represents a cardioprotective effect
of naproxen or a cardiotoxic effect of rofecoxib is
not clear. gi ulcer warnings and precautions similar to those required for current nsaids still are
necessary until further clinical experience with
these agents is obtained.24
when given in chronic dosing, cox-2 inhibitors—like other nsaids—can produce renal toxicity, including renal insufficiency; sodium retention with hypertension and edema; hyperkalemia;
and papillary necrosis. it should be noted that
both cox-1 and cox-2 enzyme systems play a
role in maintaining kidney function. because the
precise relationship between the cox-1 and cox2 enzyme isoforms in the kidney has yet to be
determined, the same caution should be applied
to cox-2 inhibitors as is applied to the nonspecific nsaids.25
drug interactions associated with these cox-2
inhibitors may be due to shifts in their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic responses. while
celecoxib is metabolized by the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of liver hepatocytes and gut entero-

pharmacology

cytes, liver oxidative enzymes play a minor role in
rofecoxib metabolism. both drugs may alter
kidney function and subsequently reduce the
elimination of lithium and the efficacy of furosemide. aspirin coadministration with either of these
cox-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of developing gi ulcerations. pharmacokinetic interactions reported for rofecoxib include reduced
methotrexate elimination and increased rofecoxib
metabolism with rifampin. celecoxib is more
rapidly metabolized when administered with
fluconazole.26,27
like other nsaids, both celecoxib and rofecoxib
may decrease the antihypertensive effects of
 xxxg36xxx  inhibitors. this
may be due to the cox mechanisms that play an
important role in maintaining normal renal blood
flow, especially in hypertensive patients. cox-2
inhibitors are not recommended for use in pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester.28
patients with a history of aspirin or nsaid allergy
or who have aspirin- or nsaid-sensitive asthma
should also avoid cox-2 inhibitors.
according to the manufacturer, celecoxib is
contraindicated for use by patients reporting sulfonamide allergy.29 like the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and sulfisoxazole, celecoxib is a
sulfonamide derivative. a meta-analysis of 14
celecoxib trials did not reveal a higher frequency
of allergic reactions among patients with a history
of sulfonamide hypersensitivity.27 the concern
regarding cross-sensitivity between celecoxib and
sulfonamide allergy may be only theoretical and,
therefore, not clinically relevant.
conclusions and recommendations
for the dental practitioner

the newly introduced cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib
and rofecoxib are nsaids that provide some therapeutic advantage over nonselective cox inhibitors by limiting the adverse gi toxicity and
platelet inhibition seen with chronic administration of currently available nsaids.
the decision to select one of these new cox-2
inhibitors should be based on the following:
dcelecoxib and rofecoxib offer the advantage of
once- or twice-per-day dosing regimens.
dstudies to date indicate that the cox-2
inhibitors have little or no effect on platelet
aggregation and bleeding parameters.
dof the currently marketed cox-2 inhibitors,
only rofecoxib has demonstrated analgesia comparable with that provided by ibuprofen 400 mg in
