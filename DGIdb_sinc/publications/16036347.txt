abstract
the mitochondrial production of  xxxd2298xxx , in the presence of different respiratory substrates (succinate, glutamate,
malate and isocitrate), is stimulated by submicromolar concentrations of  xxxd248xxx , a highly specific inhibitor of thioredoxin
reductase. this effect is particularly evident in the presence of antimycin.  xxxd248xxx  was also able to unmask the production of
 xxxd2298xxx  occurring in the presence of rotenone. however, at variance with whole mitochondria,  xxxd248xxx  does not
stimulate  xxxd2298xxx  production in submitochondrial particles indicating that it does not alter the formation of
 xxxd2298xxx  by the respiratory chain but prevents its removal. as the mitochondrial metabolism of  xxxd2298xxx 
proceeds through the peroxidases linked to glutathione or thioredoxin, the relative efficiency of the two systems and the effects
of  xxxd248xxx  were tested. in conclusion, the inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx  determines an increase of the basal flow of
 xxxd2298xxx  leading to a more oxidized condition that alters the mitochondrial functions.

introduction
mitochondria are considered the major cellular producers of h2o2 both in normal and pathological conditions
[1–3]. formation of h2o2 occurs both at the inner and
outer membranes [2]. at the inner mitochondrial
membrane, the autoxidation of specific sites at the level
of complex i and iii brings to the formation of
superoxide anion that, either directly or through
manganese superoxide dismutase, is converted to
h2o2 [3]. in the outer membrane, monoamine oxidase

forms h2o2 independently of the respiration and in a
two-electron process [4].
since its discovery, the formation of hydrogen
peroxide has been deemed as unavoidable consequence
of the mitochondrial electron transport and the systems
devoted to its removal were considered to simply prevent
the potentially toxic consequences of the oxidizing
species formed. however, more recently, reactive
oxygen species and particularly h2o2 are also considered as metabolic regulators, suggesting a potential
physiologic role played by the production of h2o2 that,

in response to cytokines and growth factors stimulation,
can act as redox signal [5,6]. consequently, oxygen
radicals can be critical in the decision by mammalian
cells to undergo proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis or
senescence [7,8]. the regulation of the cellular
functions by h2o2 or, in general, by oxidizing species,
can be exerted by different mechanisms such as the
reversible oxidation or glutathionylation of specific thiol
groups [7 – 9] or complex formation – dissociation
between redox sensible proteins such as thioredoxin
and  xxxg905xxx  and specific proteins [10,11].
 xxxd2298xxx  produced by mitochondria can
either regulate events occurring within mitochondria
themselves or can be released outside, therefore
influencing cytosolic processes or neighbouring
mitochondria. on the whole, the reactive oxygen
species alter the mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis that, in turn, is involved in the modulation of
several mitochondrial functions including permeability condition and cell apoptosis.
in mitochondria, two systems able to reduce h2o2
and  xxxd2298xxx , are present. the first
depends on glutathione and the enzymes glutathione
reductase and glutathione peroxidase [12]. to the
glutathione system is also associated the dithiolcontaining protein  xxxg905xxx  able to catalyze the
reduction of s-glutathionylated substrates or to act as
a disulfide reductase [13]. the second peroxide
removing system depends on thioredoxin [14] and
the enzymes  xxxg1826xxx  [15,16] and
peroxiredoxin [17,18]. mitochondrial thioredoxin
reductase, similarly to its cytosolic counterpart, is a
selenium enzyme containing a couple cysteineselenocysteine at the c-terminal moiety [16,19].
we have previously observed that the inhibition of
mitochondrial  xxxg1826xxx  by nanomolar
concentrations of  xxxd248xxx  or other gold(i) compounds determines an extensive mitochondrial swelling, a decrease of membrane potential and the release
of  xxxg569xxx  [20,21].  xxxd248xxx  (s-triethylphosphinegold(i)-2,3,4,6-tetra-o-acetyl-1-thio-b-dglucopyranoside) belongs to the gold(i)-based drug
class utilized in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
[22] and experimentally tested as anticancer compound [23]. in the antitumor action of gold(i)
complexes an important role is played by mitochondria [24]. a correlation was therefore established
between the action on the thioredoxin system and the
alterations of the mitochondrial membranes.
since h2o2 is the terminal substrate of the
thioredoxin system we have explored the correlation
between the inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx  and
the production of mitochondrial h2o2. in the present
paper, we report that mitochondria, in the presence of
 xxxd248xxx , are able to elicit a large formation of
 xxxd2298xxx  that depends essentially on a
decrease of its removal. therefore, it is apparent that
a balance between production and removal of h2o2

occurs and has important consequences for the
functioning of mitochondria and the whole cell.
materials and methods
preparation of mitochondria, submitochondrial particles
and mitochondrial supernatant fraction
rat liver mitochondria were prepared by differential
centrifugation according to myers and slater [25] using
a medium containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm
sucrose, 1 mm edta and 5 mm hepes at ph 7.0.
edta was omitted in the washing and in the final
suspension of mitochondria. the functionality of
mitochondrial preparations was established by the
estimation of the respiratory control ratio by following
oxygen uptake measured polarographically utilizing a
clark-type oxygen electrode [26] inserted in a waterjacketed chamber (258c) with constant stirring.
mitochondria with respiratory control ratio of 4 or
greater were utilized. submitochondrial particles were
prepared from the mitochondrial suspension (60 mg
protein ml21) diluted (1:5) with 50 mm tris-hcl
(ph 8.0) by sonicating twice for 30 s each. the obtained
suspension was first centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 10 min to
get rid of the unbroken mitochondria. the pellet was
discarded and the supernatant centrifuged at 105,000g
for 30 min. the obtained pellet was washed and
suspended in a small volume of the same medium
used for mitochondria. mitochondrial supernatant
fraction (including matrix and the intermembrane
space content) was prepared from mitochondrial
suspensions by freezing and thawing followed by
sonication and centrifugation at 105,000g for 60 min.
pellet was discarded and the supernatant extensively
dialyzed and concentrated in a pressure dialysis system.
proteins were estimated with the  xxxd2444xxx  procedure using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard [27].

estimation of  xxxd2298xxx  and superoxide production
 xxxd2298xxx  formed by mitochondria and
submitochondrial particles was determined by following the loss of fluorescence of scopoletin (7-hydroxy6-methoxy coumarin) in the presence of horseradish
peroxidase [1]. fluorescence was estimated at 308c in
a microplate reader (fluoroskan ascent fl, labsystems) at 366 nm (excitation wavelength) and
460 nm (emission wavelength).  xxxd2298xxx 
formed was quantitated by a standard curve obtained
by adding known amounts of  xxxd2298xxx  to the
medium in the presence of the detection system
(scopoletin and horseradish peroxidase). superoxide
radical anion formed by submitochondrial particles
was determined by following the conversion of
adrenaline to adrenochrome. the absorbance of
adrenochrome was monitored at 308c in a microplate
reader (multiskan ex, labsystems) at 492 – 540 nm.

 xxxd248xxx  and mitochondrial  xxxd2298xxx 
estimation of glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent
peroxidase activities in the mitochondrial supernatant
fraction
the activities of the thioredoxin and glutathione systems
were estimated in the mitochondrial fractions by following
spectrophotometrically the decrease of absorbance of
nadph at 340 nm in the presence of h2o2. incubation
conditions are indicated in the relevant figure.

purification and estimation of  xxxg1826xxx 
activity
cytosolic  xxxg1826xxx  was prepared from rat
liver according to luthman and holmgren [28] and
from rat liver mitochondria according to rigobello
et al. [15]. thioredoxin was prepared from mitochondria according to luthman and holmgren [28].
 xxxg1826xxx  activity was estimated with the
nadph-dependent reduction of dtnb (5,50 -dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) [28].
statistical analysis
all the values are the means ^ s.d. of not less than
five measurements. multiple comparisons were made
by one-way analysis of variance followed by the tukeykramer multiple comparison test.
results
the production of  xxxd2298xxx  by rat liver
mitochondria is reported in figure 1. the experiments
were performed using succinate as substrate and in state
4 conditions according to chance and williams [29].
a small production of h2o2 is apparent in the presence
of succinate alone (0.29 nmol min21 mg21 protein) and
is slightly stimulated by the further addition of  xxxd248xxx 
(0.38 nmol min21 mg21 protein). as expected, the
addition of antimycin markedly increases the production of h2o2 with respect to succinate alone
(0.52 nmol min21 mg21 protein). however, the presence of  xxxd248xxx  together with antimycin determines a
dramatic increase in the production of h2o2
(1.08 nmol min21 mg21 protein) that, after 15 min of
incubation, is more than twice as that obtained with
antimycin and succinate and about 4 times with respect
to the production observed with succinate alone. this
large production of h2o2 is completely removed by the
addition of catalase, therefore confirming the specificity
of h2o2 estimation.
in figure 1(b) the dose-response relationship
between  xxxd248xxx  action and h2o2 formation is
reported. without  xxxd248xxx , the values of basal and
antimycin-stimulated production of h2o2 are apparent on the ordinate axis and, after 15 min, are about
1.8 and 6.0 nmol mg21 protein, respectively. increasing concentrations of  xxxd248xxx  in the nanomolar
range stimulate h2o2 production that reaches its

689

half-maximal value at concentrations of about 100 nm
while at concentrations higher than 200 nm a very
slow increase with the time occurs. the rate and
extent of h2o2 production is only slightly reduced by
egta or cyclosporin. both agents act as inhibitors of
the mitochondrial membranes permeability transition
and, therefore, the lack of effect indicates that the
measured production of  xxxd2298xxx  is not due
to membrane swelling.
the strong stimulation of h2o2 production in the
presence of  xxxd248xxx  is also observed with endogenous substrates (figure 2) or other substrates added
either alone (not shown) or in combination such as
succinate/isocitrate and glutamate/malate (figure 2).
the  xxxd248xxx -induced  xxxd2298xxx  formation
is lower in the presence of rotenone than with
antimycin. in fact, in contrast to antimycin, rotenone
alone does not increase the production of hydrogen
peroxide with respect to the control (figure 2).
moreover, the effect of  xxxd248xxx  in the presence of
rotenone is particularly interesting since it is able to
unmask the production of h2o2 that, otherwise,
appears very low and close to the value of the control.
the production of h2o2 was examined in submitochondrial particles treated in different conditions and in
the presence of succinate as substrate (figure 3). a large
formation of h2o2 is observable when antimycin is
present. however, at variance with the result obtained
with whole mitochondria, the addition of  xxxd248xxx  does
not change the production of h2o2 by submitochondrial
particles, indicating that this compound is ineffective in
directly altering the formation of reactive oxygen species
by the respiratory chain. submitochondrial particle
preparations are devoid of the  xxxd2298xxx 
removing systems and, therefore the net production of
 xxxd2298xxx  by the respiratory chain can be
observed. in fact, most of the activity of the h2o2
removing systems is apparently localized at the level of
the soluble fraction of mitochondria comprising the
matrix and the intermembrane space. the presence of
superoxide dismutase does not increase the production
of  xxxd2298xxx  by submitochondrial particles
(figure 3) indicating that all the measured hydrogen
peroxide derives from the spontaneous dismutation of
the superoxide anion. to further validate this point the
direct production of the superoxide anion was also
followed (inset to figure 3). it can be observed that
 xxxd2298xxx  and superoxide production are
strictly correlated. the formation of the latter is almost
completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase indicating
the specificity of the measurement.
the activities of the two major and well-recognized
systems, respectively linked to glutathione and
thioredoxin, were comparatively estimated by following the rate of absorbance decrease of nadph in the
presence of  xxxd2298xxx  as donor of oxidizing
equivalents (figure 4). the dialyzed soluble fraction,
devoid of glutathione, gives rise to a slight rate of

were incubated at 308c in 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm kcl, 0.5 mm k-phosphate, 20 mm hepes/tris (ph 7.4) and, when present, 5 mm
succinate, 1 mm antimycin, 0.8 mm  xxxd248xxx , 1 mm catalase. the  xxxd2298xxx  production was followed as decrease of fluorescence of
scopoletin as indicated under “materials and methods” section. reactions were initiated by the addition of horseradish peroxidase. in (b) the
effects of increasing concentrations of  xxxd248xxx  on the production of  xxxd2298xxx  in the presence of 5 mm succinate are reported.
experimental conditions are as in (a). when indicated, 1 mm antimycin, 1 mm cyclosporin and 1 mm egta were also present.

nadph oxidation that probably corresponds to the
activity of the endogenous thioredoxin system.
however, thioredoxin may be limiting and, in fact,
the addition of exogenous thioredoxin increases the
rate of nadph oxidation (figure 4, trace a) and gives
an indication of the contribution of the thioredoxin
system to the removal of peroxides. the addition of
glutathione, instead of thioredoxin, to the mitochondrial soluble fraction, markedly stimulates the

oxidation of nadph (figure 4, trace c) showing the
activation of the glutathione system that cooperates
with the thioredoxin system to the removal of
 xxxd2298xxx . the presence of  xxxd248xxx  almost
completely prevents the stimulation elicited by
thioredoxin (figure 4, trace b), but it is ineffective in
inhibiting the gsh-dependent stimulation of
nadph oxidation (figure 4, trace d). both the
mitochondrial and cytosolic purified isoforms of

about the same extent (inset to figure 4).
discussion
the reported results indicate that  xxxd248xxx  strongly
stimulates the mitochondrial  xxxd2298xxx 
production in the presence of antimycin and,
to a lower extent, of rotenone. a slight stimulation of
 xxxd2298xxx  production is also apparent in

the absence of inhibitors and is particularly significant
when succinate þ isocitrate are present as substrates
(figure 2). on the contrary, in submitochondrial
particles,  xxxd248xxx  is no longer able to stimulate the
production of  xxxd2298xxx  (figure 3). this
result clearly indicates that  xxxd248xxx  does not
stimulate nor inhibit the formation of hydrogen
peroxide by the respiratory chain but the large
stimulation observed with whole mitochondria can
be referred to the inhibition of the  xxxd2298xxx

removing systems and, more specifically, to the
inhibition of the thioredoxin system. the effect of
 xxxd248xxx  is particularly interesting when the respiratory chain is inhibited by rotenone since only in the
presence of the latter a net production of h2o2 can be
observed while, with rotenone alone, there is not
apparent stimulation of h2o2 formation. according
to chen et al. [30], in the presence of rotenone, h2o2
is produced at complex i and is directed towards the
matrix of mitochondria where it is completely
removed by the various scavenging systems. however,
the inhibition of the thioredoxin system by  xxxd248xxx 
allows part of h2o2 to escape from the mitochondrion
and to be detected outside by the scopoletin/horseradish peroxidase system. with antimycin, hydrogen
peroxide is produced both at complex i and iii and
does not appear to be completely removed
by the antioxidant systems as it can be estimated
in the outside medium. in this case, the extent of
stimulation of  xxxd2298xxx  production by
 xxxd248xxx  is very large.

the alterations of the mitochondrial seleniumdependent enzymes elicit an increase of h2o2
production. in fact, mitochondria obtained from
selenium-deficient rats and incubated with succinate
exhibit an increase in h2o2 production [31] indicating
that the mitochondrial selenoenzymes are important
for h2o2 removal. although glutathione peroxidase is
considered to have a relevant role in this function, also
the mitochondrial isoform of  xxxg1826xxx 
should be taken into account (figure 4). furthermore, liver mitochondria isolated from mice deficient
in mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase release h2o2
at about four times the rate exhibited by mitochondria
of control mice [32] again indicating that glutathione
peroxidase plays a major role in controlling the level of
h2o2 in liver mitochondria where this enzyme
essentially exerts a detoxifying action. however,
according to the same authors [32] liver mitochondria
obtained from mice lacking glutathione peroxidase,
although forming higher levels of h2o2, do not show a
tendency greater than that of the control to undergo

figure 4. removal of  xxxd2298xxx  by the mitochondrial glutathione and thioredoxin systems and effect of  xxxd248xxx . the dialyzed
soluble mitochondrial fraction (0.5 mg protein ml21) was incubated at 378c in 50 mm hepes buffer (ph 7.0) in the presence of 0.25 mm
nadph and 0.5 mm h2o2. the activity of the thioredoxin system was sparked by the addition of 40 mm thioredoxin (a and b), while the
activity of the glutathione system was initiated by the addition of 8 mm gsh (c and d). in (b) and (d) 1 mm  xxxd248xxx  was also present. the
specific activities of the thioredoxin and glutathione systems were 1.54 ^ 0.3 nmol min21 mg21 protein and 5.17 ^ 0.6 nmol min21 mg21
protein, respectively. the inset reports the effect of increasing concentrations of  xxxd248xxx  on the purified cytosolic ( xxxg2363xxx ) and mitochondrial

permeability transition indicating that the elevated
h2o2 levels are not strictly necessary to activate
“pore” opening. in addition, the inhibition of
 xxxg981xxx  by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1nitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx ), which leads to the oxidation of
glutathione in the presence of tert-butylhydroperoxide,
is not associated with an increased efflux of
accumulated calcium [33]. therefore, when considering the redox control of the permeability properties of
mitochondrial membranes, the level of hydrogen
peroxide is apparently less important than the type,
redox state and regeneration kinetics of the specific
sensor targeted by  xxxd2298xxx .  xxxd248xxx  does
not alter the glutathione system as none of its
components is inhibited (figure 4 and [20]) and,
therefore, the observed effect should be essentially
attributed to the inhibition of the thioredoxin system.
as reported in the “introduction” section, there is
increasing evidence indicating that h 2o 2 is a
component of membrane receptor signalling [18].
in mammalian cell, several extracellular stimuli, such
as interleukin-1,  xxxg2296xxx  [34],
platelet-derived growth factor [35], and epidermal

growth factor [36], induce an intracellular transient
increase of  xxxd2298xxx  that acts as a second
messenger. intracellular reactive oxygen species
formed after  xxxg2296xxx  stimulation are
mostly removed by the mitochondrial thiol dependent
redox systems causing an imbalance in the thiol status
[37]. according to gitler et al. [38] in the presence of
calcium ions an apparent inhibition of thioredoxin
reductase occurs. this condition, coupled to the burst
of h2o2 formation that rapidly reacts with the active
site of peroxidases, brings to the formation of
peroxiredoxin disulfides. consequently, a transient
redox change in cellular thiol proteins involved in
signal transduction occurs. in mitochondria, a similar
condition is created by  xxxd248xxx  that strongly
prevents the activity of  xxxg1826xxx . in fact,
in mitochondria,  xxxd2298xxx  is continuously
formed and, in condition where  xxxg1826xxx 
is inhibited, mitochondrial peroxiredoxin oxidizes
thioredoxin that cannot be restored again to its
reduced state (figure 5). in turn, oxidized thioredoxin
can act on several different targets, leading to the
opening of the pore or increasing the permeability of

the outer membrane and, therefore, causing the
release of apoptogenic factors (figure 5). thioredoxin
in its oxidized form can interact with vicinal dithiols of
proteins forming intraprotein disulfides. alternatively,
according to its redox conditions thioredoxin can
interact with protein targets similarly to the regulation
to which ask-1 (apoptosis signalling kinase) protein
is subjected[10].
the thioredoxin/ xxxg1826xxx  system
seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
arthritis since increased levels of thioredoxin were
found in the synovial fluid and tissue of patients
suffering from rheumatoid arthritis [39]. in the
synovial tissue of these patients an increased expression
of  xxxg1826xxx  was also observed [39].
therefore,  xxxg1826xxx  can be considered a
target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [40]
although it is likely that drugs such as  xxxd248xxx  can act
on multiple cellular sites [41]. in mitochondria
 xxxd248xxx  induces membrane permeability transition
and release of  xxxg569xxx  [20,21] and, therefore, can
be included among the compounds endowed with
proapoptotic properties. these actions of  xxxd248xxx 
might partially explain at the molecular level its
antinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.
the thioredoxin system plays a critical role in the
thiol-mediated cellular redox regulation and in
controlling cellular apoptosis or proliferation [40].
it was recently shown that activated p53, which
induces apoptosis in a human cell line, is also able to
repress the transcription and expression of thioredoxin
reductase [42]. along the same line, it was shown that
mitochondrial thioredoxin-deficient cells undergo
apoptosis [43] and that the inhibition of thioredoxin
reductase with  xxxd248xxx  stimulates mitochondrial
permeability transition and release of  xxxg569xxx 
[20,21]. on the contrary, thioredoxin elicits
a protective effect in cells subjected to oxidative

stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting  xxxg569xxx 
release and procaspase-9 activation [44]. furthermore, cells overexpressing thioredoxin show an
increased resistance to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity
[45] and oxidant-mediated apoptosis [46]. finally, it
has been shown that overexpression of mitochondrial
 xxxg1826xxx  is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinomas [47]. all these
results indicate a striking correlation between the
thioredoxin system overexpression and the growth of
tumors, therefore making this system an attractive
target to the development of antitumor drugs [40].
