comparison of (+)-(11)c-mcn5652 and (11)c-dasb as serotonin transporter radioligands under various experimental conditions.  there has been considerable interest in the development of a pet radioligand selective for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-ht]) transporter (sert) that can be used to image 5-ht neurons in the living human brain. the most widely used sert radiotracer to date, trans-1,2,3,5,6,10-beta-hexahydro-6-[4-(methylthio)phenyl[pyrrolo-[2,1-a]isoquinoline ((+)-(11)c-mcn5652), has been successful in this regard but may have some limitations. recently, another promising sert radiotracer, 3-(11)c-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile ((11)c-dasb), has been described. the purpose of this study was to compare and contrast (+)-(11)c-mcn5652 and (11)c-dasb under various experimental conditions.
