abstract
to elucidate the effect of an inhibitor of  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes,  xxxd439xxx , on the activity of  xxxg2204xxx  in
vivo, we have investigated the effect of  xxxd439xxx  on the extracellular concentration of  xxxd5xxx  in the rat striatum using an in vivo
microdialysis technique. the intrastriatal perfusion of  xxxd439xxx  caused a significant decline in the extracellular concentration of dserine. these data, together with the fact that  xxxg2204xxx  is a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzyme, suggest that the aminooxyacetic acidinduced reduction of the extracellular  xxxd5xxx  may be at least in part due to the drug's ability to inhibit  xxxg2204xxx .

1. introduction
high concentrations of  xxxd5xxx , previously assumed to be
unnatural in mammals, have recently been observed in the
mammalian brain (hashimoto and oka, 1997; hashimoto et al.,
1993, 1995, 2000; schell et al., 1995). accumulating evidence
indicates that  xxxd5xxx  plays a regulatory role as an indispensable
co-agonist for the glutamate activation of n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptors (hashimoto and oka, 1997; hashimoto et al.,
1993; kleckner and dingledine, 1988; matsui et al., 1995). dserine potentiates the nmda receptor-mediated transmission by
selective stimulation of the glycine site of the nmda receptors
(kleckner and dingledine, 1988; matsui et al., 1995). in vivo
microdialysis studies have also indicated that the extracellular
concentration of  xxxd5xxx  is comparable to that of glycine in the
prefrontal cortex and striatum, and that depolarizing stimuli such
as veratrine, kainate or nmda produce a reduction in the
extracellular level of  xxxd5xxx  in a tetrodotoxin-, cnqx (6-cyano7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione)- or mk-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine)-reversible
manner, respectively (hashimoto et al., 1995, 2000).

concerning the de novo synthesis of  xxxd5xxx , an
intraperitoneal administration of l-serine has been shown to
cause a significant enhancement in the  xxxd5xxx  concentrations in
several brain areas and periphery (hashimoto, 2002; takahashi
et al., 1997). furthermore,  xxxg2204xxx , which directly
converts  xxxd5xxx  to l-serine, has been purified and cloned from
the mammalian brain (konno, 2003; wolosker et al., 1999a,b).
several lines of evidence have revealed that the regional
distribution of  xxxg2204xxx  corresponds well with those of
the endogenous  xxxd5xxx  and nmda receptors with the higher
levels in the forebrain and the lower levels in the hindbrain
(hashimoto et al., 1993; wolosker et al., 1999b; yoshikawa et
al., 2004). interestingly, we have recently shown that mk-801
upregulates the expression of  xxxg2204xxx  mrna in the rat
brain (yoshikawa et al., 2004).
the  xxxg2204xxx  has a  xxxd3047xxx  binding
consensus region, and mutations of the lysine 56, which is
predicted to bind  xxxd3047xxx , diminish the activity of
 xxxg2204xxx  (wolosker et al., 1999a,b). aminooxyacetic
acid ( xxxd439xxx ) is a potent inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphatedependent enzymes. in vitro studies using purified and
recombinant  xxxg2204xxx  have recently demonstrated that
 xxxd439xxx  potently reduced the enzyme activity (wolosker et al.,
1999a,b). microdialysis studies have also shown that the local
application of  xxxd439xxx  (0.3–2.0 mm) inhibits pyridoxal

phosphate-dependent enzymes in the brain (speciale et al.,
1990; swartz et al., 1990; wu et al., 1992). to ascertain the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd439xxx  on the activity of  xxxg2204xxx  in
vivo, we have attempted to quantify the extracellular levels of
 xxxd5xxx  and l-serine when perfused with  xxxd439xxx  using a
microdialysis technique. because depolarizing stimuli cause a
decline in the extracellular  xxxd5xxx  in a tetrodotoxin-reversible
manner (hashimoto et al., 1995, 2000), we have also
investigated the effect of the co-application of tetrodotoxin with
 xxxd439xxx .
2. materials and methods
the present animal experiments were performed in strict
accordance with the guidelines of tokai university, and were
approved by the animal investigation committee of the
university. the in vivo microdialysis was performed as
previously reported (hashimoto et al., 1995, 2000). briefly,
male wistar rats weighing 220–270 g were anesthetized with
pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and mounted on a
stereotaxic frame. the dialysis probe was then implanted into
the striatum (a + 0.5 mm, v + 7.0 mm, l − 3.0 mm). two days
after surgery, the dialysis probe was perfused with ringer
solution (nacl, 147 mm; kcl, 4 mm; cacl2, 1.3 mm; ph 7.3)
at a flow rate of 2 mul/min. dialysate samples were collected
every 20 min. after collection of three basal fractions, 0.5 mm
 xxxd439xxx  (wako, japan) was added to the perfusion solution
throughout the experiment, either in the presence or absence of
2 mum tetrodotoxin (sigma, usa). the simultaneous determination of the free amino acid enantiomers and non-chiral amino
acids in the dialysate was accomplished using high-performance
liquid chromatography (hplc) and fluorometric detection as
previously described (hashimoto et al., 1993). briefly, the
dialysate sample was derivatized with n-tert-butyloxycarbonyll-cysteine and o-phthaldialdehyde for 2 min at room

temperature. the amino acid derivative was then immediately
applied to the hplc system.
the average of the concentration of each amino acid during
the period preceding the various treatments (three measurements performed every 20 min) was used as the control value
(= 100). individual data are expressed as percentages of this
baseline period. the means with s.e.m. of the results obtained
from four to five animals were calculated using the corresponding periods. the areas under the curve (auc) of the
concentration vs. time plots for a dialysate at 0–240 min postadministration were calculated and used as overall measures of
the treatment effects. statistical comparisons were carried
out between the groups on the auc data using the
student's or cochran–cox t-test.
3. results
fig. 1 shows the time course of changes in the extracellular
concentration of  xxxd5xxx  in the striatum of rats treated with
 xxxd439xxx  (0.5 mm), an inhibitor of  xxxg2204xxx . the
intrastriatal perfusion of  xxxd439xxx  caused a 60% decrease in the
extracellular concentration of  xxxd5xxx  200 min after the drug
perfusion. although co-perfusion of a sodium channel blocker,
tetrodotoxin, with  xxxd439xxx  partially reversed the  xxxd439xxx -induced
reduction of the extracellular level of  xxxd5xxx , there is a
significant difference between the controls and  xxxd439xxx  plus
tetrodotoxin-treated group. the l-serine concentration in the
dialysate tended to decrease after the  xxxd439xxx  administration, but
there is no significant difference between the controls and
 xxxd439xxx -treated group (fig. 2). in addition, the perfusion of
 xxxd439xxx  failed to enhance the extracellular concentration of lglutamate compared with the controls (data not shown).
4. discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated, using an in vivo
microdialysis technique, that the intrastriatal perfusion of

 xxxd439xxx  produced a significant decline in the extracellular
concentration of  xxxd5xxx , but not l-serine. because  xxxd439xxx  is
an inhibitor of  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes (beal et
al., 1991; speciale et al., 1990; wolosker et al., 1999a,b), the
 xxxd439xxx -evoked reduction in the extracellular  xxxd5xxx  may be at
least in part due to the drug's ability to inhibit  xxxg2204xxx 
activity. several lines of evidence support this possibility: (a) in
vitro studies using purified and recombinant  xxxg2204xxx 
have indicated that  xxxd439xxx  potently inhibits the enzyme activity
(wolosker et al., 1999a,b); (b) although the striatal application
of depolarizing agents, such as veratrine, kainate or nmda, has
been shown to cause a significant reduction in the extracellular
level of  xxxd5xxx  in a tetrodotoxin-, cnqx- or mk-801reversible manner, respectively (hashimoto et al., 1995, 2000),
the simultaneous perfusion of  xxxd439xxx  with tetrodotoxin also
caused a significant decrease in the extracellular concentration
of  xxxd5xxx  in the present study; and (c) the  xxxd439xxx 
administration failed to reduce the extracellular level of lserine, suggesting that the effect of  xxxd439xxx  is specific for dserine. further studies such as dose-dependency and measurement of  xxxd5xxx  content in tissue are needed to clarify the
drug's ability to inhibit  xxxg2204xxx .
the co-application of  xxxd439xxx  with tetrodotoxin partially
reversed the  xxxd439xxx -induced decline of the extracellular dserine. although the exact mechanism underlying the partial
reversal is still unclear, this could be attributed to the indirect
activation of the nmda receptors by  xxxd439xxx  (beal et al., 1991).
the  xxxd439xxx  administration has been shown to produce
excitotoxic lesions in a mk-801-reversible manner, although
 xxxd439xxx  does not directly open the ion channels of the nmda
receptors (beal et al., 1991). this possibility was further
supported by the findings that the  xxxd439xxx  application leads to an
nmda-receptor dependent enhancement of the evoked
potentials in cortical neurons (scharfman, 1996). alternatively,
because the local perfusion of tetrodotoxin alone produced a
slight but significant augmentation of the extracellular level of
 xxxd5xxx  (hashimoto et al., 1995), the tetrodotoxin administration could result in an elevation of the carrier-mediated
release of  xxxd5xxx  due to the possible alterations in the
equilibrium of the concentration gradient for sodium ions
(bernath and zigmond, 1990; hashimoto et al., 1995).
because  xxxd5xxx  could play an important role in a variety of
pathophysiological conditions for the hyper- and hypofunctions
of the nmda receptors as an endogenous indispensable coagonist of nmda receptors (hashimoto and oka, 1997),
selective inhibitors or activators of  xxxg2204xxx  may be
therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of diseases related to
the hyper- and hypofunctions of the nmda receptor-mediated
neurotransmission.
