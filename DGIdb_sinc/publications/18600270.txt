sulfonamide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, hydroﬂumethiazide,  xxxd3066xxx ,  xxxd2627xxx ,
 xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx , furosemide and bumetanide were tested as inhibitors of the zinc enzyme
carbonic anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1). these drugs were discovered in a period when only isoform ca
ii was known and considered physiologically/pharmacologically relevant. we prove here that although
acting as moderate to weak inhibitors of ca ii, all these drugs considerably inhibit other isozymes
known nowadays to be involved in critical physiologic processes, among the 16 cas present in
vertebrates. some low nanomolar/subnanomolar inhibitors against such isoforms were detected, such
as among others  xxxd2627xxx  against ca vii, xii and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  against ca vb, vii, ix,
xii and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  against ca vii, ix, xii and xiii, furosemide against ca i, ii and xiv, and
 xxxd381xxx  against ca ix and xii. the x-ray crystal structure of the ca ii– xxxd2343xxx  adduct was
also resolved at high resolution, and the binding of this sulfonamide to the enzyme was compared to
that of  xxxd1872xxx , sulpiride and a pyridinium containing sulfonamide.  xxxd2343xxx  binds to
ca ii in a manner not seen earlier for any other ca inhibitor, which might be important for the design
of compounds with a different inhibition proﬁle.

introduction
diuretics are among the most widely used clinical agents and
their discovery was a great success of both synthetic organic
chemistry and pharmacology, with most of these agents being
discovered in the late 50s and 60s.1–3 right from the beginning of
research in this ﬁeld, it was clear that many compounds incorporating so2 nh2 groups showed this pharmacological activity.1–3
 xxxd63xxx , acetazolamide 1,
originally developed as an inhibitor of the zinc enzyme carbonic
anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) was the ﬁrst non-mercurial diuretic
to enter into clinical use, in 1956.1,2 acetazolamide played a
major role in the development of fundamental renal physiology
and pharmacology, as well as for the design of many of the
presently widely used diuretic agents, such as among others the
thiazide and high ceiling diuretics, compounds exerting their
diuretic action by promoting  xxxd3213xxx  (and osmotically
obligated water) excretion in different segments of the nephron.1–6
in mammals, 16 different a-ca isozymes or ca-related proteins
(carp) were described so far, with very different catalytic activity,
subcellular localization, tissue distribution and susceptibility to
be inhibited by sulfonamides.1–5,7,8 these enzymes catalyze a
very simple physiological reaction, the interconversion between
carbon dioxide and the bicarbonate ion, and are thus involved
in crucial physiological processes connected with respiration
and transport of co2 /bicarbonate between metabolizing tissues

and lungs, ph and co2 homeostasis, electrolyte secretion in a
variety of tissues/organs, biosynthetic reactions (such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis and ureagenesis), bone resorption, calciﬁcation, tumorigenicity, and many other physiologic/pathologic
processes.1–5,7,8 cas are highly abundant in the kidneys (a total
concentration of about 8–10 lm has been estimated for this
organ), and many isoforms have been shown to be present in
various tissues of this organ.9,10 ca isoforms present in kidneys,
such as ca ii, iv, vb, ix, xii and xiv play a crucial function in
at least three physiological processes: (i) the acid–base balance
homeostasis (by secreting and excreting protons, due to the
carbon dioxide hydration reaction catalysed by these enzymes);
(ii) the bicarbonate reabsorption processes, and (iii) the renal
nh4 + output.2,11,12 these important functions are well localised in
the different segments of the nephron: bicarbonate reabsorption
occurs in the proximal tubule, whereas urinary acidiﬁcation and
nh4 + output occur in the distal tubule and collecting duct.2,11,12
following the administration of a ca inhibitor (cai), such as
acetazolamide 1, the urine volume promptly increases, and its
normally acidic ph (of 6) becomes alkaline (around 8.2).2,10–12
an increased amount of bicarbonate is eliminated into the urine
(120 times higher than the amount eliminated normally), together
with na+ , and k+ as accompanying cations, whereas the amount
of chloride excreted is diminished. the increased alkalinity of the
urine is accompanied by a decrease in the excretion of titratable
acid and ammonia, and in consequence by metabolic acidosis. this
sequence of events is due to the inhibition of various ca isozymes
in the proximal tubule, which leads to inhibition of h+ secretion
by this segment of the nephron. inhibition of both cytosolic (ca
ii) as well as membrane-bound (ca iv and ca xiv) enzymes
seems to be involved in the diuretic effects of the sulfonamides.2,11,12
inhibition of such cas decreases the availability of protons for the

na+ –h+ antiporter, which maintains a low proton concentration
in the cell. the net effect of these processes is the transport of
sodium bicarbonate from the tubular lumen to the interstitial
space, followed by movement of the isotonically obligated water,
and whence augmented diuresis. cais also increase phosphate
excretion (by an unknown mechanism) but have little or no effect
on the excretion of calcium or  xxxd2531xxx .2,11,12

some anecdotal reports indicate that it might be beneﬁcial for
patients suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease.1,11
using acetazolamide 1 as a lead, a large number of other quite
successful sulfonamide diuretics were developed in the 60s and
70s, such as the benzothiadiazines 6 (hydrochlorothiazide 6a, hydroﬂumethiazide 6b and the like),  xxxd3066xxx  7,  xxxd2627xxx  8,
 xxxd1680xxx  9,  xxxd2343xxx  10, furosemide 11 and bumetanide
12.1–3 some of them are among the most widely clinically used
diuretics,6,11,13 and as they all possess primary so2 nh2 moieties,
acting as excellent zinc-binding groups for the metal ion present
within the ca active site,1–3 it is to be expected that they should
also have ca inhibitory properties. however, this issue has been
investigated only in the 60s or 70s when these drugs were launched,
and when only one ca isozyme (i.e., ca ii) was presumed
to exist and be responsible for all the physiological effects of
the sulfonamide drugs.11 here we reinvestigate the interaction of
some of these clinically used diuretics with all 12 catalytically
active mammalian ca isoforms and also report the x-ray crystal
structure of one of them ( xxxd2343xxx  10) with ca ii. such
data might be useful for the design of novel classes of more
isozyme-selective cais and probably also to understand some
new pharmacological effects of these old drugs.

results and discussion
ca inhibition studies

acetazolamide 1, and structurally related sulfonamides, such as
 xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3 and  xxxd1872xxx  4 were
and are still used for the treatment of edema due to congestive
heart failure, and for drug-induced edema, in addition to their
applications as antiglaucoma agents.1,2,11 however, these systemic
cais generally produce many undesired side effects due to
inhibition of cas present in other organs than the kidneys.1,2 the
structurally related compound to acetazolamide,  xxxd307xxx  5,
with a quite acidic pk a of 3.2 for the secondary sulfonamide group
is completely ionised at physiological ph, as the sulfonamidate
anion.11 its renal effect on bicarbonate excretion is around 10 times
as potent as that of acetazolamide, the drug being maximally active
at doses of 1 mg kg−1 , and being actively and rapidly accumulated
in the kidney, but its plasma half-life is only 20 min.11 all these
facts make  xxxd307xxx  a renal speciﬁc cai, but the compound
remained an orphan drug and has not been developed for wide
clinical use, due to its inappropriate pharmacokinetics, although
2500 | org. biomol. chem., 2008, 6, 2499–2506

table 1 shows inhibition data of 12 ca isozymes (i.e., ca i, ii,
iii, iv, va, vb, vi, vii, ix, xii, xiii and xiv) obtained by a
stopped-ﬂow assay14 monitoring the physiological reaction (co2
hydration to bicarbonate) with the clinically used sulfonamides
1–12. data of table 1 show that similarly to the clinically
used/orphan drug classical sulfonamide cais, i.e., compounds
1–5, the clinically used sulfonamide diuretics 6–12 also act as
inhibitors of all twelve investigated ca isozymes, but with an inhibition proﬁle quite different from that of inhibitors investigated
earlier, and particularly different from that of sulfonamides 1–5.
the following should be noted from these inhibition data. (i)
hydrochlorothiazide 6a acts as a medium potency inhibitor of
isoforms hca i, ii, vb, ix and xii, with inhibition constants
in the range of 290–603 nm, the compound being a weaker
inhibitor of isoforms hca va, vi, vii, xiii and xiv (k i s
in the range of 3.655–5.010 lm) and an exceedingly weak one
against hca iii (k i of 0.79 mm). (ii) hydroﬂumethiazide 6b
shows an inhibition proﬁle quite distinct from that of the closely
structurally related diuretic 6a, being a rather efﬁcient inhibitor
of the following isoforms: hca ii, vb, vii, ix, xii and xiv,
with inhibition constants in the range of 305–435 nm. this
sulfonamide is a weaker inhibitor of hca i, iv and vi (k i s
in the range of 2.84–8.25 lm) and shows very weak inhibition
against isozymes hca iii, va and xiii (k i s of 10.2–870 lm).
it is already apparent that even small structural changes in the
benzothiadiazine scaffold, such as the substitution of the chlorine
atom ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety by a triﬂuoromethyl group,
such as in the pair 6a/6b, has dramatic consequences for the ca
inhibitory properties of the two compounds, basically against all
investigated ca iozymes (table 1). (iii)  xxxd3066xxx  7 is the
only diuretic among compounds 1–12 investigated here which is
not approved for clinical use in europe (but it is approved in

usa),6,11 and this derivative was not available to be investigated
here. literature data3b show it to be a very weak hca i and a
modest hca ii inhibitor, with inhibition constants in the range of
1.26–35 lm (table 1). (iv)  xxxd2627xxx  8 shows very weak hca
i and iii inhibitory properties (k i s in the range of 54–610 lm),
and is a low micromolar inhibitor (thus, not a very efﬁcient one)
of hca ii, vi and xiv, with inhibition constants in the range of
1.714–5.432 lm. however, the drug is a medium potency inhibitor
of isozymes hca iv, va, vb and ix (k i s in the range of 216–
750 nm) and a very efﬁcient one against hca vii, hca xii and
mca xiii (k i s in the range of 2.1–15 nm). (v)  xxxd1680xxx  9
also shows a very interesting inhibition proﬁle, acting as a weak
hca iii inhibitor (with a k i of 11 lm, this compound is one
of the most effective hca iii inhibitors ever detected among
all know sulfonamides except triﬂuoromethanesulfonamide which
has a k i of 0.9 lm),3b,15 and a rather weak hca vi and hca xiv
inhibitor (k i s in the range of 1.347–4.95 lm).  xxxd1680xxx  is
a moderate hca va inhibitor (k i of 917 nm) and an effective,
or very effective inhibitor of the other mammalian ca isozymes.
thus, the ubiquitous hca i and ii, as well as hca iv, show
inhibition constants in the range of 138–348 nm, but isoforms
vb, vii, ix, xii and xiii are inhibited in the low nanomolar
range (k i s in the range of 2.8–23 nm). these results showing 9 to
be such a strong cai against many isoforms are quite unexpected,
and considering the wide clinical use of the compound for the
treatment of hypertension,16 at least two issues can be raised: is
the inhibition of these ca isozymes responsible for some of the
therapeutic effects of the drug (or for some side effects observed
with it), and, secondly, can these observations be useful for the
design of cais with increased selectivity for some ca isoforms or
for envisaging novel therapeutic applications of the drug (e.g., an
adjuvant to antitumor therapies, considering its strong inhibitory
effects against the tumor-associated ca isozymes ix and xii)?17
we shall reply to some of these questions after considering in detail
the inhibition proﬁle of the remaining three drugs. (vi)  xxxd2343xxx 
10 acts as an inefﬁcient ca i and iii inhibitor (k i s in the range
of 51.9–230 lm), is a weak inhibitor of isoforms ca ii, va, vi,
and xiv (k i s in the range of 890–4950 nm) but shows signiﬁcant
inhibitory activity against ca iv and vb (k i s in the range of 213–
274 nm) and excellent inhibition of ca vii, ix, xii and xiii,
with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range (k i s of 0.23–
36 nm). these data are indeed remarkable, also considering the
wide use of the drug as diuretic and its beneﬁcial effects in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as recently reported in an important
clinical trial.13 (vii) furosemide 11 acts as a very weak hca
iii inhibitor (k i of 3200 lm), but it shows moderate inhibitory
activity against many isoforms, namely ca iv, va, vb, vi, vii,
ix, xii and xiii, with k i s in the range of 261–564 nm. the
compound is on the other hand a much better inhibitor of
ca i, ii and xiv, with k i s in the range of 52–65 nm. (viii)
 xxxd381xxx  12 is again an extremely weak hca iii inhibitor (k i
of 3400 lm), similarly to furosemide with which it is structurally
related. however,  xxxd381xxx  is also a weak inhibitor of hca i, ii
and xiii (k i s in the range of 2570–6980 nm), probably due to the
quite bulky phenoxy moiety ortho to the sulfamoyl zinc-binding
group. the compound shows better inhibitory activity against
isoforms ca iv, va and xiv (k i s in the range of 250–700 nm)
but excellent inhibition of the tumor-associated isoforms ca ix
and xii (k i s in the range of 21.1–25.8 nm, i.e., the same order of

magnitude as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2 or  xxxd2058xxx 
3). thus, it may be observed that  xxxd381xxx  is an effective
inhibitor of only the tumor-associated isoforms ca ix and xii,
discriminating thus between these drug targets17 and other ca
isoforms that should not be inhibited by a cancer-speciﬁc cai.
but what is the relevance of this study for the drug design
of cais with diverse pharmacological applications? we think
that there are at least several aspects that need to be considered
here for answering this question. first, these widely used drugs
were considered to be inactive as cais, due to the fact that
they were launched in a period when only ca ii was well
known (and considered to be responsible for all physiological
effects of cais). it may indeed be observed that in contrast to
the classical cais of type 1–5 (generally low nanomolar ca ii
inhibitors), all compounds 6–12 (except furosemide 11) are much
weaker inhibitors of this isozyme, usually in the micromolar range.
indeed, only furosemide 11 is a good ca ii inhibitor among these
diuretics, with a k i of 65 nm, whereas all others show k i s in the
range of 138–6980 nm (table 1). again with the exception of
furosemide 11, the diuretics 6–12 have low afﬁnity for ca i, the
other isoform known when these drugs were discovered. however,
data in table 1 show that many of the drugs 6–12 appreciably
inhibit cas discovered after their introduction in clinical use, with
some low nanomolar (or even subnanomolar) inhibitors against
many of them. examples of such situations, are among others:
 xxxd2627xxx  8 against ca vii, xii and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  9
against ca vb, vii, ix, xii and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  10 against ca
vii, ix, xii and xiii, furosemide 11 against ca i, ii and xiv,
and  xxxd381xxx  12 against ca ix and xii (table 1). as already
mentioned above,  xxxd381xxx  12 is a tumor-speciﬁc (targeting
ca ix and xii) cai, of equal potency to acetazolamide 1, but
without the promiscuity of acetazolamide which is a potent cai
against most mammalian isozymes. indeed,  xxxd381xxx  is a weak
inhibitor of all other isoforms except ca ix and xii, which are
overexpressed in tumors.17  xxxd2343xxx  10 and  xxxd1680xxx  9
are also strong inhibitors of the tumor-associated cas, but they
are also effective in inhibiting ca vii and xiii (table 1). it is thus
clear, that these old drugs may indeed have newer applications
in therapy or as experimental agents, in situations in which the
selective inhibition of some ca isozymes is needed, and which
cannot be obtained with the presently used compounds of types
1–5.
a second important aspect of these ﬁndings is whether we can
explain some recent observations of clinical trials in which such
diuretic agents have been employed, and how this is reﬂected in
the drug design process. thus, a relevant question arising is how
these inhibitory activities of compounds of type 6–12 against ca
isoforms known nowadays to play important physiological roles,1–8
is reﬂected by the pharmacological effects (or side effects proﬁle)
of these drugs? it is in fact known that many interesting classes of
novel drugs have been discovered just by observing side effects of
some clinically used agents.1–3 recently it has been observed that
 xxxd2343xxx  10 in combination with an ace inhibitor (as diuretics)
are highly beneﬁcial for the treatment of patients with hypertension
and type 2 diabetes.13 treatment with  xxxd2343xxx  was also shown
to lead to a signiﬁcant decrease of plasma adiponectin concentration in patients with essential hypertension.13 adiponectin is
considered to participate in the pathogenesis of carbohydrate
metabolism disturbances often found in patients treated with other
2502 | org. biomol. chem., 2008, 6, 2499–2506

thiazide-type diuretics.13 on the other hand, classical sulfonamide
cais such as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2  xxxd2058xxx 
3, and other compounds possessing such properties, are known to
induce vasodilation in a variety of tissues and organs, including
the kidneys, eye vasculature, brain vessels, etc.18,19 however, the
exact mechanisms by which they produce this beneﬁcial effect
for many pathologies (e.g., hypertension, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy, etc.), or the isoforms involved in it, are unknown
for the moment.18,19 in line with these studies,18,19 a very recent
report shows that  xxxd2343xxx  10 has a protective role against
ischemia-induced injury and dysfunction of the blood–brain
barrier, probably due to its vasodilating effects.20 an organprotective effect of  xxxd2343xxx  in animal models of renal failure
has also been reported, showing the drug to be beneﬁcial in
preventing damage to the capillary structures, the endothelium,
and in reducing the hypertrophy of superﬁcial glomeruli among
others.13,21 all these effects are probably mediated by inhibition
of cas present in blood vessels or in the kidneys, but no speciﬁc
pharmacological or biochemical studies are available so far, except
for these clinical observations mentioned here.13,19–21 the lesson
we learn from all these data is that probably many of the recently
reported beneﬁcial clinical properties of  xxxd2343xxx  10 are due
indeed to its diuretic effects, but in conjunction with its strong
inhibition of some ca isozymes (such as ca iv, vb, vii, ix, xii
and/or xiii) reported here for the ﬁrst time, isoforms present in
kidneys and blood vessels. this hypothesis may explain both the
blood pressure lowering effects as well as organ-protective activity
of the drug. for medicinal chemists this means that probably it
is possible to design sulfonamide cais possessing an inhibition
proﬁle similar to 10, but with a stronger activity against the target
isoform(s) involved in these pathologies, provided that it will be
possible to understand which these isozymes are.

crystallographic parameters and reﬁnement statistics for the hca
ii–10 complex are shown in table 2, whereas table 3 presents
hydrogen bonds and other contacts of the hca ii–10 adduct.
the electron density map of 10 bound to the active site of hca
ii is shown in fig 1, whereas fig. 2 and 3 show the detailed
interactions of the  xxxd1171xxx  bound within the enzyme active
site. a superposition of the active site of hca ii complexed
with  xxxd2343xxx  10, with that of the hca ii complexes of other
sulfonamide cais such as  xxxd1872xxx  4, the positivelycharged sulfonamide 13 and sulpiride 14, is presented in fig. 4.
in order to understand at molecular level the interactions between
 xxxd2343xxx  10 and the active site of a ca isozyme, we report
here the x-ray crystal structure of its adduct with the ubiquitous,
highly investigated isoform hca ii.1–4 crystallographic reﬁnement
of the hca ii–10 adduct was performed at a ﬁnal resolution
of 2.1 å. crystals of the adduct were isomorphous with those
of the native protein,22–26 allowing for the determination of the
crystallographic structure by difference fourier techniques. the
reﬁned structure presented a good geometry with rmsd from ideal
bond lengths and angles of 0.015 å and 1.8◦ , respectively (table 2).
the overall quality of the model was good with all residues in the
allowed regions of the ramachandran plot. reﬁnement statistics

with the presence of one molecule of  xxxd1171xxx  bound within
the active site (fig. 1).
interactions between the protein and the zn2+ ion were entirely
preserved in the adduct (data not shown), as in all other hca
ii–sulfonamide/sulfamate/sulfamide complexes investigated so

fig. 1 simulated annealing omit |2fo–fc| electron density map of
 xxxd2343xxx  10 bound within the hca ii active site.

far.23–26 a careful analysis of the three-dimensional structure of
the complex revealed a compact binding between the inhibitor
and the enzyme active site, similar to that observed earlier for
other such complexes, with the tetrahedral geometry of the zn2+
binding site and the key hydrogen bonds between the so2 nh2
moiety of the inhibitor and enzyme active site all retained (fig. 2
and 3, and table 3).22–26 in particular, the ionized nitrogen atom
of the sulfonamide group of 10 is coordinated to the zinc ion
at a distance of 2.15 å (table 3). this nitrogen is also hydrogen
bonded to the hydroxyl group of thr199 (n–thr199og = 2.86 å),
which in turn interacts with the glu106oe1 atom (2.5 å, data
not shown). one oxygen atom of the sulfonamide moiety is
3.06 å away from the catalytic zn2+ ion, being considered as
weakly coordinated to the metal ion, whereas the second one
participates in a hydrogen bond (of 3.19 å) with the backbone
amide group of thr199.23–26 his64 (in its in conformation) makes
strong van der waals contacts (<4 å) with the conh moiety of
the inhibitor, but these interactions cannot actually be considered
as hydrogen bonds (table 3). a very strong interaction is on the
other hand the strong offset face-to-face stacking between the
annulated ortho-phenylene moiety of  xxxd1171xxx  and the phenyl
group of phe131 (table 3 and fig. 2 and 3), which has been
observed previously for several other adducts of hca ii with
sulfonamides such as the pyridinium derivative 138b and sulpiride

fig. 3 detailed interactions in which  xxxd2343xxx  10 (in yellow) participates when bound within the hca ii active site. active site residues
coordinating the metal ion (his94, 96, 119) as well as those involved in the
binding of the inhibitor (his64, phe131 and thr199) are shown. distances
are presented in table 3.

14.26a such a stacking interaction was in fact demonstrated to be
highly important for the orientation of the inhibitor within the
active site and for the potency of a sulfonamide as cai against
this isoform.8b thus, in order to better understand the binding of
10 to hca ii, the superpositions of its hca ii adduct with those of
 xxxd1872xxx  426b as well as those of sulfonamides 138b and
1426a are shown in fig. 4. two facts can be observed. first, a quite
unexpected orientation for the phenyl ring of inhibitors 4 and 10
bound within the enzyme active site may be observed with respect
to that of other benzene-sulfonamides whose structures in complex
with hca ii have been reported (fig. 4a).22–26 it may be seen that
the plane of the phenyl moiety of the benzene-1,3-disulfonamide
4 and of  xxxd2343xxx  10 appears clearly rotated by almost 30◦
and tilted by approximately 10◦ with respect to its most recurrent
orientation, as the one of derivatives 138b and 1426a (fig. 4b and 4b).

this peculiar conformation may be ascribed to the presence
of the secondary sulfonamide group in the meta position of 4,
and the corresponding bulky carbohydrazide substituent in the
meta position to the sulfamoyl moiety of 10, which probably
orientates the entire molecule in this unusual conformation, when
bound within the enzyme cavity. in addition, both these cais
(i.e., 4 and 10) possess a chlorine atom ortho to the sulfamoyl
moiety coordinated to the zn(ii) present in the enzyme cavity,
which could also inﬂuence the orientation of the organic scaffold
due to steric impairment in the rather restricted environment
near the metal ion. in fact, fig. 4a shows that the sulfamoylchloro-phenyl fragment present in the scaffold of inhibitors 4 and
10 is practically completely superposable in these two hca ii–
sulfonamide complexes, whereas the second sulfamoyl group of
 xxxd1872xxx  4 binds in the same active site region as the
much bulkier carbohydrazide moiety of  xxxd2343xxx  10 (fig. 4a).
the second feature which is salient for the adduct of 10 with hca ii
regards the stacking interaction in which phe131 participates with
the phenylene moiety of the bicyclic ring present in  xxxd2343xxx .
as seen from fig. 2–4, the two rings, i.e., the ortho-phenylene
moiety of the  xxxd1171xxx  and the phenyl group of phe131 are
strictly parallel to each other, being at a distance of 3.41–3.46 å.
the same stacking has been previously evidenced between the
phenyl moiety of phe131 and the 2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium ring
of the positively-charged sulfonamide 13,8b or the same phenyl
moiety and the n-ethyl-pyrrolidine group of sulpiride 14.26a in
both these complexes this stacking interaction has been one of the
main factors assuring a strong afﬁnity of the inhibitor for the hca
ii active site. as seen from fig. 4b and 4c, although the phenylene
moiety of 10 binds in the same active site region as the trimethylpyridinium ring of the positively-charged sulfonamide 13,8b
and the n-ethyl-pyrrolidine group of sulpiride 14,26a these three
cyclic moieties are not very well superposable with each other,
which in part probably explains the net difference of activities as
hca ii inhibitors between the three compounds. thus, whereas 13
is a very strong hca ii inhibitor (k i of 21 nm),8b sulpiride 14 is a
slightly weaker one (k i of 40 nm)26a whereas 10 is a moderate-weak
inhibitor (k i of 2.52 lm, table 1). however, we consider this as a
quite positive and interesting feature of  xxxd2343xxx  as a cai (as
discussed above), which might be used to design compounds with
reduced afﬁnity for the ubiquitous, house-keeping enzyme hca
ii, but strong inhibitory properties against other isoforms, such as
hca iv, vb, vii, ix, xii or xiii, against which  xxxd2343xxx  acts
as a much more efﬁcient cai (table 1).

sulfonamides 1–12 are commercially available compounds (from
sigma-aldrich, milan, italy). the twelve ca isozymes used in
the experiments were recombinant ones obtained and puriﬁed as
reported earlier by this group.27–30

ca inhibition assay
an applied photophysics (oxford, uk) stopped-ﬂow instrument was used for assaying the ca catalysed co2 hydration
activity. phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) was used
as indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm,
with 10 mm hepes (ph 7.5) as buffer, and 0.1 m na2 so4 (for
maintaining constant ionic strength), following the ca-catalyzed
co2 hydration reaction.14 the co2 concentrations ranged from
1.7 to 17 mm for the determination of the kinetic parameters
and inhibition constants. for each inhibitor at least six traces
of the initial 5–10% of the reaction were used for determining
the initial velocity. the uncatalyzed rates were determined in the
same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. stock
solutions of inhibitor (10 mm) were prepared in distilled-deionized
water with 10–20% (v/v) dmso (which is not inhibitory at these
concentrations) and dilutions up to 0.01 lm were done thereafter
with distilled-deionized water. inhibitor and enzyme solutions
were preincubated together for 15 min at room temperature prior
to assay, in order to allow for the formation of the e–i complex.
the inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares
methods using prism 3, and represent the mean from at least
three different determinations.14
x-ray crystallography
the hca ii–10 adduct was crystallized as previously described.25,26
diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 k)
on a ccd detector km4 ccd/sapphire using cuka radiation
(1.5418 å). the unit cell dimensions were determined to be:
a = 41.32 å, b = 42.02 å, c = 72.25 å and a = c = 90◦ ,
b = 104.25◦ in the space group p21. data were processed with
crysalis red (oxford diffraction 2006).31 the structure was
analyzed by difference fourier technique, using the pdb ﬁle
1ca2 as starting model. the reﬁnement was carried out with
the program refmac5;32 model building and map inspections
were performed using the coot program.33 the ﬁnal model of
the complex  xxxg293xxx / xxxd2343xxx  had an r-factor of 22.8% and
r-free 29.0% in the resolution range 20.0–2.1 å, with a rms
deviation from standard geometry of 0.015 å in bond lengths
and 1.8◦ in angles. the correctness of stereochemistry was ﬁnally
checked using procheck.34 coordinates and structure factors
have been deposited with the protein data bank (accession code
3bl1). crystallographic parameters and reﬁnement statistics are
summarized in table 2.

conclusions
we investigated whether such widely used drugs as the benzothiadiazines and high ceiling diuretics, among which hydrochlorothiazide, hydroﬂumethiazide,  xxxd3066xxx ,  xxxd2627xxx , chlorthalithis journal is © the royal society of chemistry 2008

done,  xxxd2343xxx , furosemide and bumetanide, which contain
primary sulfamoyl moieties acting as potential zinc-binding
functions, may show signiﬁcant inhibitory effects against 12
catalytically active mammalian cas. these drugs are widely used
clinically and were launched in a period when only isoform ca
ii was known and considered physiologically/pharmacologically
relevant, and thus no inhibition data against other ca isoforms
are available in the literature. although acting as moderate to weak
inhibitors of ca ii and ca i, all these drugs considerably inhibit
other ca isozymes known nowadays to be involved in critical
physiological processes, among the 16 cas present in vertebrates.
some low nanomolar (or even subnanomolar) inhibitors against
such isoforms were detected, such as  xxxd2627xxx  against ca vii,
xii and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  against ca vb, vii, ix, xii and
xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  against ca vii, ix, xii and xiii, furosemide
against ca i, ii and xiv, and  xxxd381xxx  against ca ix and
xii. the x-ray crystal structure of the ca ii– xxxd2343xxx  adduct
was also resolved at high resolution, showing features that may
be useful for the drug design of novel classes of cais. we also
propose that the recently observed beneﬁcial effect of  xxxd2343xxx 
for the treatment of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes
is due to its potent inhibition of ca isoforms present in kidneys
and blood vessels, which explains both the blood pressure lowering
effects as well as organ-protective activity of the drug. lessons for
the drug design of novel sulfonamide ca inhibitors based on these
ﬁndings are also discussed.
