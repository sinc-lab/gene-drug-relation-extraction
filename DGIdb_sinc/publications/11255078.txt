abstract
overexpression of  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) has been demonstrated on many human tumors, and the increase
in receptor expression levels has been linked with a poor clinical prognosis. blocking the interaction of egfr and the growth
factors could lead to the arrest of tumor growth and possibly result in tumor cell death. to this end, using xenomouse™
technology,  xxxd2838xxx , a human igg2 monoclonal antibody (mab) specific to human egfr, has been generated.  xxxd2838xxx 
binds egfr with high affinity (5 ×10 − 11 m), blocks the binding of both egf and transforming growth factor-a (tgf-a) to
various egfr-expressing human carcinoma cell lines, and inhibits egf-dependent tumor cell activation, including egfr tyrosine
phosphorylation, increased extracellular acidification rate, and cell proliferation. in vivo  xxxd2838xxx  prevents completely the
formation of human epidermoid carcinoma a431 xenografts in athymic mice. more importantly, administration of  xxxd2838xxx 
without concomitant chemotherapy results in complete eradication of established tumors. no tumor recurrence was observed for
more than 8 months following the last antibody injection, further indicating complete tumor cell elimination by the antibody.
inhibition of human pancreatic, renal, breast and prostate tumor xenografts which express different levels of egfr by  xxxd2838xxx 
was also achieved. tumor expressing more than 17 000 egfr molecules per cell showed significant growth inhibition when treated
with  xxxd2838xxx .  xxxd2838xxx  had no effect on egfr-negative tumors. the potency of  xxxd2838xxx  in eradicating well-established
tumors without concomitant chemotherapy indicates its potential as a monotherapeutic agent for treatment of multiple
egfr-expressing human solid tumors, including those where no effective chemotherapy is available. utilization of mabs directed
to growth factor receptors as cancer therapeutics has been validated recently by the tumor responses obtained from clinical trials
with herceptin, the humanized anti-her2 antibody, in patients with her2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. being a fully

1. production of human monoclonal antibody using
xenomouse technology

xenomouse strains, have been created by introducing
human immunoglobulin genes into mice engineered to
lack functional mouse immunoglobulin genes.

1.1. e6olution of monoclonal antibody technology
with the development of hybridoma technology by
kohler and milstein more than 25 years ago, the
potential of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) for human
therapy was easily appreciated [1]. however, the promise
of the ‘magic bullet’ was not immediately realized since
the first generation of mabs was derived from mouse and
the mouse mabs were in general immunogenic in humans
leading to the generation of human anti-mouse antibody
(hama) responses, thus limiting efficacy in long term
and repeated administration.
to reduce the immunogenicity of the mouse mabs and
to overcome the problem of hama, tremendous efforts
have been made to engineer part-human, part-mouse
‘chimeric’ mabs and mostly human ‘humanized’ mabs
(fig. 1). the chimeric mab is created by genetically
combining the antigen-binding regions (fv) of the mouse
antibody with  xxxd2207xxx  constant domains. the resulting chimeric antibody consists of 34% mouse protein [2].
the humanized mabs are constructed by ‘implanting’
the complementary-determining regions (cdr) of the
mouse antibody into the  xxxd2207xxx  framework. the
humanized antibody still contains approximately 5 –10%
mouse protein sequences [3]. although the chimeric and
humanized recombinant mabs have improved the therapeutic utility, they require significant protein engineering efforts and could be still immunogenic [2,3].
therefore, to fully realize the value of mab technology,
the ultimate goal is to establish a simple and robust
system by which fully human mabs can be readily
generated. to this end, transgenic strains of mouse,

1.2. xenomouse technology and fully human
monoclonal antibodies
to reconstitute a robust human humoral immune
system in mice, the mouse endogenous ig gene loci were
functionally inactivated by gene targeted deletions of
crucial cis-acting sequences of heavy and light (k) chains
involved in the mouse ig gene rearrangement and expression, jh and ck, respectively [4,5]. the mouse embryonic
stem (es) cells containing the targeted heavy or k chain
allele were utilized to generate mice homozygous for each
of the jh or ck deletions. crossbreeding of these mice
yielded double-inactivated (di) mice, homozygous for
both mutations. in order to preserve the variable gene
diversity and to maintain the regulatory elements that
control antibody recombination and expression, dna
fragments spanning the majority of the human heavy and
light chain loci were cloned and recombined into yeast
artificial chromosomes (yacs) in germline configuration. the heavy chain yacs encompassed 66 different
consecutive vh genes (representing about 80% of the
human vh gene repertoire), all 30 d segments, and all
six jh genes. the cd region was retro-fitted with the
human g1, g2 or g4 constant region.ck constant region.
the heavy and light chain yacs were introduced into
mice via fusion of yac-containing yeast spheroplasts
with mouse es cells [5–7]. crossbreeding of these mouse
strains resulted in the transgenic mice producing human
antibodies in the presence of mouse antibodies.
finally the xenomouse strains which are homozygous
for the inactivated mouse heavy and k-chain genes

fig. 2. creation of xenomouse technology. xenomouse strains were created by introducing human ig genes into the mice, which carry the
inactivated mouse ig gene loci.

and bearing one allele each of the human heavy and the
k chain were created by breeding the human antibodyproducing transgenic mice with the di mouse strain [7]
(fig. 2).
analysis of xenomouse lymphoid organs and serum
revealed that b cell development and the serum human
antibody responses were restored [8]. more importantly, diverse human antibody responses to multiple
antigens were demonstrated in the xenomouse strains.
upon immunization with either soluble antigens such
as il-8 or cell-bound antigens such as egfr, high
affinity fully human mabs were generated using standard hybridoma technology [7]. xenomouse technology offers a unique and reliable source for rapid
generation and production of antigen-specific and high
affinity fully human therapeutic mabs. fully human
mabs are anticipated to be nonimmunogenic and thus
to allow repeated administration without human antihuman antibody response. this provides a significant
advantage in antibody therapy of chronic and recurring
human disease, such as cancer. in this article, the
properties and the anti-tumor activity of a xenomousederived fully human anti-egfr antibody,  xxxd2838xxx ,
are summarized.

2.  xxxd2838xxx , a fully human monoclonal antibody to
egf receptor

2.1. egfr o6erexpression on human tumors
various growth factors and growth factor receptors
have been implicated in a wide variety of human cancers. egf is a mitogenic hormone that regulates the
proliferation and differentiation of normal and neoplastic cells in vitro as well as in vivo. production of
tgf-a, an egf-related polypeptide growth factor, has
been associated with cellular transformation. the
egfr, which binds both egf and tgf-a, is struc-

turally related to the transforming protein encoded by
the v- xxxg682xxx  oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus.
this homology between egfr and an oncogene
product suggests that growth factor receptor abnormality may contribute to neoplastic transformation [15].
elevated levels of egfr expression characterize a
wide range of carcinomas such as epidermal and
squamous cell carcinomas, non-small cell lung cancer,
and gliomas [9–11]. the overexpression is either the
consequence of gene amplification, as in the case of
many gliomas, or, more commonly, of increased gene
transcription [10]. it was proposed that overexpression
of egfr plays a role in the tumorigenesis of cancer
cells [12]. indeed, invasiveness and poor differentiation
were found to correlate with the high number of egf
receptors in some tumors such as bladder [13]. moreover, several tumors show association of increased
egfr expression with detectable levels of its ligand,
tgf-a, and tgf-a can act as a potent mitogen in cells
overexpressing egfr, suggesting the involvement of the
egfr/tgf-a autocrine loop in the development of
some human malignancies [14].
numerous neutralizing mabs specific to the human
egfr have been generated from rodents [15 –19]. some
of these antibodies, such as the murine mabs 225 and
528, have been extensively characterized and evaluated
in mouse xenograft models [15 –17]. when administered
into mice bearing established human tumor xenografts,
225 and 528 mabs caused a partial tumor regression
and required concomitant chemotherapy for complete
eradication of the tumors [16,17]. the chimeric version
of the 225 mab ( xxxd467xxx ) showed an improved binding
affinity and in vivo anti-tumor activity at the high doses
[20]. these data established a rationale for antibody
therapy targeting egfr expressing solid tumors. however, being a mouse or mouse-human chimeric antibody
and the requirement for chemotherapy can limit the
efficacy and utilization of anti-egfr antibodies for
patients who developed hama responses and patients
with cancers for which chemotherapy is unavailable.

therefore, the identification of a fully human antiegfr mab that can be used as monotherapy may
expand the patient population and allow repeated administrations in immunocompetent patients. a panel of
fully human mabs was generated against egfr using
the xenomouse technology [21].

2.2. generation and selection of  xxxd2838xxx 
a panel of human igg2 anti-egfr mabs was generated by immunizing the xenomouse igg2 strain with
cells of the human cervical epidermal carcinoma cell
line a431, which expresses more than 106 egfrs per
cell. a total of 70 egfr-specific hybridomas were
established from five fusions. among these, at least 15
are neutralizing antibodies. the anti-egfr mabs
demonstrated high binding affinity to egfr (10 − 9 –
10 − 11 m) [22]. in vitro,  xxxd2838xxx , formerly known as
clone  xxxd2838xxx  [21], binds egfr with an affinity of 5×
10 − 11 m, blocks the binding of both egf and tgf-a
to the receptor, and inhibits egf-activated egfr tyrosine phosphorylation and tumor cell activation. this
results in the inhibition of in vitro tumor cell proliferation.  xxxd2838xxx  does not activate the egfr tyrosine
kinase. upon binding to the receptor,  xxxd2838xxx 
causes egfr internalization in tumor cells (unpublished
data). the  xxxd2838xxx -producing hybridoma was found
to have a relatively high productivity of 12 pg/cell per
day in serum-free medium [21].

2.3. egf receptor-dependent tumor inhibition
administration of  xxxd2838xxx  led to the complete
prevention of a431 tumor formation, eradication of
established tumors, and inhibition of tumor growth at

relatively low doses without concomitant chemotherapy
or radiation therapy in xenograft tumor models. the
data indicate that  xxxd2838xxx  can provide effective therapy to tumors that require the egfr pathway for their
continuous progression and survival. to verify further
this concept and to elucidate the mechanism of action,
we evaluated the anti-tumor effect of  xxxd2838xxx  on
multiple human solid tumors that are derived from
different tissues and display different expression levels
of egfr in xenograft models.
the egfr expression level on the cell surface was
quantitated using flow cytometric analysis of immunofluorescent stained cells. the number of egfr was
determined by analytical flow cytometry in conjunction
with fluorescent r-phycoerythrin (r-pe) bound microbead standards [23]. cells were incubated in the
presence of mouse anti-egfr antibody 225, washed,
and stained with r-pe-conjugated goat-anti-mouse
igg. the resulting cellular fluorescence intensity was
extrapolated onto a standard fluorescence calibration
curve derived from an r-pe quantitative fluorescence
standard kit (flow cytometry standards corporation,
san juan, pr). the microbead standard consisted of
goat-anti-mouse igg covalently bound to the exterior
of polymeric beads. the calibration curve was generated by plotting the given number of equivalent bound
r-pe molecules per bead versus the log of its mean
fluorescence intensity. as shown in table 1, the egfr
expression levels on human breast, epidermal, renal,
pancreatic, prostate, ovarian and colon carcinoma cell
lines ranged from 0 to 1.6 million copies per cell.
to determine whether the egfr expression level on
tumor cells correlates with their responses to abxegf-mediated anti-tumor therapy, the tumor cells

were inoculated s.c. into nude mice (n = 10) at day 0. tumor sizes were measured twice a week for more than 8 weeks.  xxxd2838xxx  (1 mg) (filled

derived from kidney (sk-rc-29), pancreas (bxpc-3,
hs766t, and hpac), prostate ( xxxg1682xxx ), ovary (igrovi)
and colon (ht-29 and sw707) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) into nude mice (5× 106 cells/mouse).
the mice were then treated intraperitoneally with 1mg
 xxxd2838xxx  twice a week for 3 weeks. tumor sizes were
measured twice a week. as demonstrated in fig. 3,
 xxxd2838xxx  treatment led to significant growth inhibition of tumors expressing 17 000 or more egfrs per

cell. in contrast, the growth of tumors expressing
11 000 or fewer egfrs per cell was unaffected by the
 xxxd2838xxx  treatment. importantly,  xxxd2838xxx  had no
effect at all on the egfr-negative tumor sw707. these
data strongly support the concept that overexpression
of egfr on tumors is accompanied by growth-dependency on the egfr pathway and that blocking the
egfr pathway with neutralizing anti-egfr antibodies
such as  xxxd2838xxx  can lead to tumor growth arrest and

22

x.-d. yang et al. / critical re6iews in oncology/hematology 38 (2001) 17–23

tumor eradication. furthermore, the data also indicate
that  xxxd2838xxx  can inhibit not only the tumors that
express extremely high level of egfr such as a431 and
mda-mb-468 but also other human carcinomas which
express substantially lower levels of egfr (table 1).
considering the fact that normal human skin keratinocytes express approximately 9200 egfrs per cell,
 xxxd2838xxx  may not have significant impact on the
growth of egfr-positive normal cells such as keratinocytes [23].
the mechanism behind the potent in vivo anti-tumor
activity of  xxxd2838xxx  remains elusive but may involve
the induction of apoptosis triggered by blocking egfr
signaling pathways, inhibition of angiogenesis, and/or
inhibition of differentiation of the tumor cells. since
 xxxd2838xxx  is a human igg2 antibody that essentially
lacks effector functions, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity probably do not account for the in vivo anti-tumor
effect. this is further supported by the fact that the
e7.5.2 antibody, which is also a human igg2 antiegfr antibody derived from the same xenomouse
igg2 strain but is nonneutralizing, had no significant
inhibitory effect on a431 xenograft tumor growth (fig.
4).

agent in a variety of human carcinoma xenografts that
overexpress egfr. the observation that tumor growth
inhibition by  xxxd2838xxx  is dependent on egfr number
suggests that the growth of egfr overexpressing tumors may mainly rely on the egfr pathway to proliferate and  xxxd2838xxx  exerts anti-tumor activity via
efficient blockade of this growth pathway. with its
significant anti-tumor activity, anticipated minimal
antigenicity, and longer serum half-life,  xxxd2838xxx  may
prove to be a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment
of cancer. based on these data, a phase i clinical trial
with  xxxd2838xxx  in multiple patient populations with
egfr-expressing solid tumors has been initiated.
