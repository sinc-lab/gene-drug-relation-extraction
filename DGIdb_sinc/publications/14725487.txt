abstract

sepracor in the us is developing  xxxd216xxx  [r,r- xxxd2155xxx ], a single
isomer form of the  xxxg92xxx  agonist  xxxd2155xxx  [ xxxd2155xxx ]. this isomer
contains two chiral centres and is being developed as an inhaled preparation for
the treatment of respiratory disorders. sepracor believes that  xxxd216xxx  has the
potential to be a once-daily therapy with a rapid onset of action and a duration of
effect exceeding 12 hours.
in 1995, sepracor acquired new england pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of
metered-dose and dry powder inhalers, for the purpose of preparing formulations
of levosalbutamol and  xxxd216xxx .
phase ii dose-ranging clinical studies of  xxxd216xxx  as a longer-acting,
complementary bronchodilator were completed successfully in the fourth quarter
of 2000. phase iii trials of  xxxd216xxx  began in september 2001. the indications
for the drug appeared to be asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(copd). however, an update of the pharmaceutical product information on the
sepracor website in september 2003 listed copd maintenance therapy as the
only indication for  xxxd216xxx .
in october 2002, sepracor stated that two pivotal phase iii studies were
ongoing in 1600 patients. sepracor estimates that its nda submission for
 xxxd216xxx , which is projected for the first half of 2004, will include approximately 3000 adult subjects.
sepracor stated in july 2003 that it had completed more than 100 preclinical
studies and initiated or completed 15 clinical studies for  xxxd216xxx  inhalation
solution for the treatment of bronchospasm in patients with copd. in addition,
sepracor stated that the two pivotal phase iii studies in 1600 patients were still
progressing.
in 1995, european patents were granted to sepracor for the use of  xxxd216xxx 
in the treatment of asthma, and the us patent application was pending.

1. profile
1.1 pharmacokinetics

preclinical studies: the sulfation of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  by human liver cytosol was significantly
slower (by a factor of 2) than that of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  or racemic (rr,ss)- xxxd2155xxx .[1]

1.2 adverse events

animal toxicology: in rats, the lowest lethal dose
of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx , by intravenous administration,
was 100 mg/kg; for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , the value was
50 mg/kg. for oral administration, the lowest lethal
dose was >1000 mg/kg for both isomers. after oral
administration, observation of adverse effects was
limited to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx , which caused abnormal

26

stance and gait, and a decrease in activity and
muscle tone. after iv administration, both isomers
caused laboured respiration, abnormal stance and
gait, and decreased activity.[2]
1.3 pharmacodynamics
1.3.1 obstructive airways disease

preclinical studies: in vitro, in a cell-based, radioactive ligand binding assay, the respective kd
values for (r,r)-, racemic (rr,ss)-, (r,s)-, (s,r)and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  for binding to the human
 xxxg92xxx  were 2.9, 5.2, 75, 103 and
3100 nmol/l. (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  showed high selectivity for the  xxxg92xxx  relative to the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor. the  xxxd2155xxx  isomers did not interact
with human muscarinic receptors. the induction of
camp levels in human bronchial epithelial cells by
racemic (rr,ss)-, (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , relative to (–)- xxxd2401xxx  (as 1.00), was 0.94, 1.02
and 0.18, respectively.[3] in vivo, in guinea-pigs,
intravenously administered (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  inhibited histamine- or allergen-induced bronchoconstriction with respective ed50 values of 0.5 and
20 mug/kg; it was 20- to 200-fold more potent than
(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx . (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  paradoxically increased airway reactivity in ventilated guineapigs.[1] in ovalbumin-sensitised and challenged mice, either (s,s)-, (r,r)- or (r,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (30 mug/
kg twice daily) was administered intraperitoneally

for 14 days. (r,r)- and (r,s)- xxxd2155xxx  significantly reduced both the early- and late-phase allergic
reactions; (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  had no effect. the effect
of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  on the late-phase reaction was
greater than the effect of (r,s)- xxxd2155xxx . (s,s) xxxd2155xxx  increased the basal tone of the airways.
airway hyper-responsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx  was
significantly reduced by (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ; (r,s)and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  had less effect.[4]
in a phase ii study, 340 patients with asthma
received a range of doses of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx . lung
function was significantly improved by (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx ; the increase in fev1, relative to baseline,
was 24–27%. the duration of action of the drug was
up to 24h.[5]
1.3.2 respiratory tract disorders

preclinical studies: in vitro, in a cell-based, radioactive ligand binding assay, the respective kd
values for (r,r)-, racemic (rr,ss)-, (r,s)-, (s,r)and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  for binding to the human
 xxxg92xxx  were 2.9, 5.2, 75, 103 and
3100 nmol/l. (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  showed high selectivity for the  xxxg92xxx  relative to the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor. the  xxxd2155xxx  isomers did not interact
with human muscarinic receptors. the induction of
camp levels in human bronchial epithelial cells by
racemic (rr,ss)-, (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , relative to (–)- xxxd2401xxx  (as 1.00), was 0.94, 1.02
and 0.18, respectively.[3]
