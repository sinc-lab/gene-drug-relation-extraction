summary
the inhibition of the aromatase-induced intratumoral estrogen synthesis is one of the main anticancer pharmacological strategies. the aim of this paper was to study if a melatonin pretreatment prior to  xxxd147xxx 
increases the eﬃciency of the aromatase inhibitor used in treating breast cancer.  xxxd147xxx  (100 lm) and
melatonin (1 nm) signiﬁcantly decreased cellular aromatase activity in unpretreated mcf)7 cells. a sequential
regimen of melatonin (1 nm) followed 24 h later by  xxxd147xxx  (100 lm) induced a signiﬁcantly higher
decrease in mcf-7 cell aromatase activity to below the values obtained in unpretreated cells. melatonin treatment
inhibited aromatase mrna expression in unpretreated cells and a sequential treatment of cells with melatonin
followed by  xxxd147xxx  induced a signiﬁcant inhibition in the aromatase mrna expression as compared to
cells exposed to the same doses of  xxxd147xxx , but without melatonin pretreatment.
the present study demonstrates that a treatment with melatonin followed by  xxxd147xxx  is the most
eﬀective way of reducing the aromatase activity in the mcf-7 cell line. the  xxxd147xxx  inhibitory eﬀect is
more potent when mcf-7 cells are pre-exposed to melatonin. our results suggest that melatonin pretreatment
increases the reduction of the aromatase activity of cells exposed to  xxxd147xxx  as a result of the decrease in
the aromatase mrna expression. the ﬁndings presented here point to melatonin pretreatment as a novel and
interesting means to increase the eﬃcacy of competitive aromatase inhibitors used in treating breast cancer.

introduction
estrogens play a signiﬁcant role in the development and
growth of breast cancer. in the hormone-dependent subtype, the role of estrogens as modulators of tumor growth
overrides the inﬂuence of other factors. the tumorigenic
eﬀect of estrogen is manifested, in part, through promotion of breast epithelial cell growth [1]. based upon the
concept that estrogen is the proximate regulator of cell
proliferation, two diﬀerent pharmacological strategies
have been employed to selectively neutralize the eﬀects of
estrogens on mammary cells: (a) development of drugs
that act through the  xxxg730xxx  interfering with the
eﬀects of the endogenous estrogens; this group includes
the selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms), of
which tamoxifen and its derivatives are the most representative examples; (b) development of drugs that interfere with the synthesis of steroid hormones by inhibiting
the enzymes controlling the interconversion from androgenic precursors, the so-called selective estrogen enzyme
modulators (seems) [1–3].
melatonin, the main  xxxd2559xxx , has been
shown to inhibit both cancer initiation and cancer cell
growth, particularly on endocrine-responsive breast

cancer [see reviews 4–7]. diﬀerent hypotheses, including
the melatonin immunomodulatory actions [8], its antioxidative eﬀects [9], or inhibition of telomerase activity
[10] have been postulated to explain the oncostatic
properties of melatonin; however, the eﬀects of this indoleamine on mammary cancer have been largely considered as a consequence of its antiestrogenic actions
[11]. at this moment, melatonin fulﬁls all the requirements to be considered as an antiestrogenic drug and we
can state that this indolamine could inﬂuence estrogenmediated cancer growth in three diﬀerent ways: (a) by
down-regulating gonadal synthesis of steroids and,
consequently, decreasing their circulating levels; (b) by
interacting with the  xxxg730xxx , decreasing the
expression of  xxxg730xxx  and inhibiting the
binding of the estradiol- xxxg730xxx  complex to
the estrogen response element on the dna, thus
behaving as a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator; and
(c) by down-regulating the activity of some enzymes,
such as aromatase, involved in the synthesis of estrogens
from androgens, that is, behaving as a selective estrogen
enzyme modulator [11].
although antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen has
been the preferred treatment of estrogen responsive

breast cancer, there is currently a shift towards treatment with aromatase inhibitors due to a growing body
of evidence supporting the role of aromatase inhibitors
[12,13].  xxxd147xxx , the ﬁrst non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor used clinically in mammary cancer, is a
reversible competitive inhibitor which binds competitively to the heme moiety of aromatase. melatonin is a
hormone that, at physiological concentrations, besides
having antiestrogenic actions, reduces the aromatase
activity and downregulates aromatase mrna steady
state levels in mcf-7 cells [11]. aromatase inhibitors
and antiestrogens have shown substantial activity in
primary and advanced breast cancer. since they exhibit
diﬀerent modes of action, attempts have been made to
combine them or to use them sequentially in order to
potentially increase their eﬃcacy [14]. therefore, the aim
of this paper was to test the hypothesis that a sequential
or alternating treatment with melatonin and  xxxd147xxx  increases the eﬃcacy of the aromatase inhibitor. the question under study was whether a short-term
melatonin pretreatment increases the sensibility of
mcf-7 cells to the subsequent inhibitory eﬀect of either
 xxxd147xxx  or melatonin itself.

materials and methods
cells and culture conditions
mcf-7 human breast cancer cells were purchased from
the american tissue culture collection (rockville,
md, usa). they were maintained as monolayer cultures in 75 cm2 plastic culture ﬂasks in dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle’s medium (dmem) (sigma chemical
co., st louis, mo, usa) supplemented with 5% fetal
bovine serum (fbs) (gibco, france), penicillin
(20 units/ml) and streptomycin (20 lg/ml) (sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa), at 37 c in a
humid atmosphere containing 5% co2. cells were
subcultured every 3–4 days by suspension in 5 mm na2edta in pbs (ph 7.4) at 37 c for 5 min.
before each experiment, stock subconﬂuent monolayers (80%) of mcf-7 cells were incubated with 5 mm
na2-edta in pbs (ph 7.4) at 37 c for 5 min, resuspended in dmem supplemented with 5% fbs and
passed repeatedly through a 25-gauge needle to produce
a single cell suspension. cell number and viability were
determined by staining a small volume of cell suspension
with 0.4% trypan blue saline solution and examining the
cells in a hemocytometer.
measurement of cellular aromatase activity
aromatase activity in mcf-7 cells was measured by the
tritiated water release assay, based on the formation of
tritiated water during aromatization of a labeled
androgenic substrate such us [1b-3h(n)]-androst-4-ene3, xxxd2153xxx  [15]. mcf-7 cells were cultured in 75 cm2
plastic culture ﬂasks in dmem supplemented with 10%

fbs, 20 units/ml penicillin and 20 lg/ml streptomycin,
at 37 c in a humid atmosphere containing 5% co2.
after 48 h, media were aspirated and replaced by
fresh media with and without 1 nm melatonin (sigmaaldrich quı́mica s.a., madrid, spain). mcf)7 cells
were incubated in either melatonin-containing or control culture media for 24 h. after this, both those cells
cultured with and without melatonin were harvested and
seeded onto 60  15 mm tissue culture dishes
(1.5  106 cells/dish) in dmem supplemented with 5%
charcoal-stripped fbs (sfbs) and incubated for 48 h.
then, the medium was changed and replenished with
fresh ones (1 ml per plate) containing 100 nm
[1b-3h(n)]- xxxd176xxx ]
(nen
life
science products, boston, ma, usa) (25–30 ci/mm) in
the presence of either 1 nm melatonin, 100 lm of the
aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  (sigma-aldrich
quı́mica s.a., madrid, spain), 1 nm melatonin plus
100 lm  xxxd147xxx , or the diluent of these drugs
(ethanol at a ﬁnal concentration lower than 0.0001%)
(figure 1). after 24 h of incubation, all culture dishes
were placed on ice for 15 min to condense any water
vapor and the media were transferred to tubes
containing 0.25 ml ice-cold 30% trichloroacetic acid
(wt/vol), vortexed and centrifuged at 1700  g for
20 min. the supernatants were extracted with chloroform, vortexed, set at room temperature for 10 min and
then centrifuged at 1700  g for 20 min. the resulting
aqueous supernatants were adsorbed with 10% dextrancoated charcoal, vortexed, centrifuged at 1700  g for
20 min and the supernatant added to vials with scintillation cocktail and counted in a beta counter. the
amount of radioactivity in water [3h] measured was
corrected by subtracting the blank values from each
sample, obtained by incubating dishes containing
medium with the tritiated androgen, but no cells. the
values were also corrected by taking into account the
fractional retention of tritium in medium water
throughout the procedure of incubation and processing,
utilizing parallel dishes containing medium plus known
amounts of [3h] water (nen life science products,
boston, ma, usa) through incubation and assay. the
fractional retention of tritium in medium water
throughout the incubation and processing of samples
was always higher than 82%.
measurement of aromatase mrna
analysis of the aromatase mrna was carried out by
reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) in mcf-7 cells.
the total cellular rna was puriﬁed with the aurumtm
total rna mini kit (bio rad laboratories inc., hercules, ca, usa) following the manufacturer’s instructions. integrity of rna was assessed by electrophoresis
in ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose-tris-borate
edta gels. the absorbance ratio a260nm/a280nm was
greater than 1.8. for cdna synthesis, 0.5 lg of total
rna were denaturated at 70 c for 10 min and reverse
transcribed 50 min at 37 c with m-mlv reverse

also carried out by rt-pcr using a set of speciﬁc
primers
[5¢-ccacccatggcaaattccatggca
(forward primer) and 5¢-tctagacggcaggtca

pcrs were performed for 34 cycles for semiquantitative analysis using the following temperature proﬁle:
55 c, 45 sec (annealing); 72 c, 90 sec (extension); and
95 c, 45 sec (denaturation). each product was electrophoresed on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose-tris-borate gels.
statistical analysis
the data on aromatase activity are expressed as the
mean±standard errors of the mean (sem). statistical
diﬀerences between groups were processed by one way
analysis of variance (anova) followed by the studentnewman–keuls test. results were considered as
statistically signiﬁcant at p<0.05.

results
the aromatase activity of mcf-7 incubated for 24 h
with tritiated androstenedione was estimated by the
formation of tritiated water. as shown in figure 2,

aromatase activity of unpretreated mcf-7 cells was
decreased by 24 h incubation with either 100 lm  xxxd147xxx  (55% of controls) or 1 nm melatonin
(10% of controls). the eﬀects of  xxxd147xxx  and
melatonin were not additive, as coincubation of the
unpretreated mcf-7 cells with both agents reduced the
aromatase activity to a similar level as when cells were
incubated with  xxxd147xxx  alone. however, a
sequential regimen of melatonin (1 nm) followed 24 h
later by  xxxd147xxx  (100 lm) resulted in an
higher antiaromatase eﬀect of this drug, signiﬁcantly
reducing (p<0.05) aromatase activity of mcf-7 cells to
values below those obtained in unpretreated cells and
exposed to the same doses  xxxd147xxx 
(figure 2). pretreatment of mcf-7 cells with 1 nm
melatonin for 24 h before the exposition to the same
concentration of melatonin, also induces a signiﬁcant
(p<0.05) decrease in the cellular aromatase activity,
higher than that previously obtained in unpretreated
cells.
in a second experiment, cells, unpretreated or
pretreated with 1 nm melatonin for 24 h, were
incubated with 100 lm  xxxd147xxx  and/or 1 nm
melatonin for 90 min and total rna was isolated to
perform semiquantitative rt-pcr with speciﬁc primers
for human aromatase. samples were taken between 28
and 32 cycles, in such a way that a linear relationship
between pcr products and ampliﬁcation cycles was
observed. in unpretreated cells,  xxxd147xxx  did
not modify aromatase rna expression compared to
control cells. melatonin treatment inhibited aromatase
mrna expression in unpretreated cells. a sequential
treatment of cells with melatonin followed by  xxxd147xxx  induced a signiﬁcant inhibition in the
aromatase mrna expression. the chromatogram
shown in figure 3 pointed out the magnitude of the

discussion
the importance of estrogens in the development of
breast cancer is well established from numerous experimental and clinical studies [16–18]. ovaries constitute
the main site of estrogen synthesis in the premenopausal
non-pregnant woman. however, there are other local
sources in some tissues, including skin, muscle, fat, benign and malignant mammary tissue, which acquire a
special importance after menopausie [19]. in these
peripheral tissues, estrogens (estrone and estradiol) are
produced mainly through aromatization of adrenal
androgen precursors (androstenedione and testosterone)
and reach tissue concentrations higher than in plasma
[20]. the principal enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens is a cytochrome p)450
complex known as aromatase [12,20]. at this moment,
one of the main strategies for the design of anticancer
drugs with estrogens as their target is based on the
inhibition of estrogen synthesis by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme [21].
melatonin exerts oncostatic eﬀects on breast cancer,
as described from in vivo and in vitro studies [4–7]. much
of the current knowledge about the mechanisms by

which melatonin inhibits tumor cell growth points to an
interaction of melatonin with estrogen-responsive
pathways, thus behaving as an antiestrogenic hormone
[7,22–24]. our group has recently described that melatonin, within its antiestrogenic actions on breast cancer
cells, reduces the aromatase activity and downregulates
aromatase mrna steady state levels in mcf-7 human
breast cancer cells, that is, it behaves as a selective
estrogen enzyme modulator by reducing the conversion
of androgens to estrogens at tumor cell level [11]. since
both melatonin and  xxxd147xxx  have been
shown to reduce tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation and decrease cellular aromatase activity [4,5,25],
the aim of this study was to assess whether a sequential
treatment with melatonin prior to  xxxd147xxx 
increases the eﬃcacy of the aromatase inhibitor used in
treating breast cancer.
the present study demonstrates that a sequential
treatment of mcf-7 cells with melatonin for 24 h followed by  xxxd147xxx  is the most eﬀective way of
reducing the aromatase activity in this tumor cell line.
 xxxd147xxx  action is more potent when mcf-7
cells are pre-exposed to melatonin rather than vehicle
for 24 h. this ﬁnding suggests that melatonin sensitizes
breast cancer cells so that  xxxd147xxx  becomes a
more eﬀective inhibitor of aromatase activity. pretreatment of mcf-7 cells with melatonin also sensitizes tumor cells to the inhibitory eﬀect of a subsequent
re)exposure to melatonin, although this eﬀect is more
modest.
subsequently, we evaluated the expression of aromatase mrna steady state levels in mcf-7 and its
possible modulation for both drugs. in unpretreated
cells,  xxxd147xxx  did not modify aromatase
rna expression compared to control cells. while  xxxd147xxx  is eﬀective in inhibiting aromatase
activity, it has been described that aromatase expression
cannot change or sometimes be increased after  xxxd147xxx  treatment both in patients and in cell culture experiments [13,26]. this ﬁnding may explain why
some patients failed therapy after extensive  xxxd147xxx  treatment. it has also been suggested that a
reduction of the circulating estrogen by aromatase
inhibitor treatment leads to the release of gonadotropins
from the pituitary of premenopausal women. these
peptide hormones activate the mechanisms which
increase the expression of aromatase in the peripheral
tissue [13]. as expected, melatonin, in unpretreated cells
also caused a reduction of aromatase mrna expression; this result conﬁrms those previously described by
our group [11]. a sequential treatment of cells with
melatonin for 24 h followed by  xxxd147xxx 
induced a signiﬁcant inhibition in the aromatase mrna
steady state levels as compared to cells exposed to the
same doses of  xxxd147xxx  but unpretreated with
melatonin. the chromatogram shown in figure 3
pointed out the magnitude of the downregulation
of aromatase expression induced by melatonin-pretreatment. cells pretreated with melatonin and then re-

figure 3. eﬀects of melatonin pretreatment on the expression of aromatase mrna in mcf-7 cells. unpretreated cells and cells pretreated with
melatonin (1 nm), for 24 h, were then incubated with  xxxd147xxx  (100 lm) and/or melatonin (1 nm) for 90 min and total rna was
isolated to perform semiquantitative rt-pcr. cdna was subjected to pcr using speciﬁc primers for p450 aromatase or gadph. the results of
a representative experiment (chromatogram analysis) are shown.

exposed to melatonin showed the lowest aromatase
mrna expression. these results suggest that the
pretreatment with melatonin increases the reduction of
the aromatase activity of cells exposed to  xxxd147xxx  as a result of the decrease in the aromatase
mrna expression induced by melatonin. melatonin
pretreatment reduces the aromatase expression in mcf7 cells and when they are later exposed to a competitive
aromatase inhibitor such as  xxxd147xxx , that
action reduces the amount of enzyme available and then
increases the eﬃcacy of this drug.
 xxxd147xxx  modulation on aromatase
expression is suppressed by adenylate cyclase inhibitors
thus indicating that a camp-dependent mechanism
might be involved [26]. in addition, in mammary cancer
cells aromatase genes ( xxxg574xxx ) contain promoters ii and
i.3 regulated by camp [27–29]. consequently, camp
activates the transcription of aromatase promoters
containing camp-responsive elements, while agents able
to decrease camp could also decrease aromatase
activity. melatonin, through a membrane-bound gi
protein-coupled  xxxg1476xxx , is reported to downregulate camp levels in a variety of cell types [30–32]. in
mcf-7 cells, melatonin at concentrations of 10 nm or
1 lm, reduced the  xxxd1742xxx -induced increase of intracellular camp [32]. our group [33] had previously
demonstrated that melatonin induced changes in cyclic
nucleotide synthesis in murine mammary glands. these
changes consisted of a decrease in camp and an increase in cgmp accumulation, both responses being
dose and time-dependent [33]. thus, camp may be the
link between melatonin,  xxxd147xxx  and aromatase activity and expression in human breast cancer
cells.
the eﬀects on aromatase mrna expression of both
melatonin and  xxxd147xxx  together both in
unpretreated and in melatonin-pretreated cells were
similar to those obtained with melatonin alone. this
ﬁnding suggests that melatonin has a predominant and
bigger eﬀect on aromatase expression than  xxxd147xxx . however, the eﬀects of both drugs together

on aromatase activity were similar to those obtained
with  xxxd147xxx  alone, which suggests that this
drug has a stronger eﬀect on aromatase activity than
melatonin. although melatonin and  xxxd147xxx 
have been shown to slow tumor proliferation and to
decrease the aromatization of androgens at tumor level, they exhibit diﬀerent modes of action.  xxxd147xxx  is a reversible inhibitor which binds
competitively to the heme moiety of aromatase, reduces
aromatase activity and therefore decreases the local
estrogen biosynthesis, but it has less important direct
eﬀects on aromatase rna expression. however, melatonin reduces the aromatase activity primarily because
it decreases aromatase mrna steady state levels in
mcf-7. the antiaromatase eﬀects of melatonin pretreatment before  xxxd147xxx  are an example of
additive actions of both hormones on the enzyme that
change androgens into estrogens. the ﬁndings presented here point to melatonin pretreatment as a novel
and interesting means to increase the eﬃcacy of competitive aromatase inhibitors used in treating breast
cancer. the development of treatments which would
combine diﬀerent pharmacological strategies, which
would reduce the concentrations needed for clinical
eﬃcacy and enhance the oncostatic activity, would be
of great beneﬁt.
