evidence of increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation in basal cell carcinomas treated with  xxxd3297xxx .  a preliminary clinical experience suggested  xxxd3297xxx , a new acetylenic retinoid, as an effective alternative topical treatment of basal cell carcinomas (bcc). the mechanisms of action of this synthetic retinoid, however, have not been yet clarified. in this work we assessed the in vivo effects of daily application of  xxxd3297xxx  for 24 wk, on 30 small superficial and nodular bcc, and the in vitro effects of  xxxd3297xxx  on immortalized basal and squamous tumor epidermal cells. cellular proliferation, apoptosis and changes in expression of retinol and  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar), p53, bcl-2, and bax were studied by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and pcr. overall, 76.7% of treated tumors showed >50% regression. complete healing was observed in 46.7% of all treated bcc, without recurrences at 2-y observation. regression was associated with reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, demonstrated by ki-67- and tdt-mediated dutp-biotin nick-end labelling-positive nuclear staining, and with enhanced  xxxg1932xxx  and bax expression, with  xxxg1931xxx  and -gamma expression unchanged. in vitro,  xxxd3297xxx  induced a concentration-dependent increase of  xxxg1932xxx  and bax associated with a greater rate of apoptosis and growth inhibition in basaloid tumor cells compared with squamous tumor cells. our studies provide convincing evidence that  xxxd3297xxx  induces bcc regression possibly by synergistic  xxxg1932xxx -dependent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic pathways.
