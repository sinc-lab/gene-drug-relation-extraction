abstract
background: survivin is a dual function protein. it inhibits the apoptosis of cells by inhibiting caspases, and also
promotes cell growth by stabilizing microtubules during mitosis. over-expression of survivin has been demonstrated to
induce drug-resistance to various chemo-therapeutic agents such as cisplatin (dna damaging agent) and paclitaxel
(microtubule stabilizer) in cancers. however, survivin-induced resistance to microtubule de-stabilizers such as vinca
alkaloids and  xxxd1744xxx  a-4 (ca-4)-related compounds were seldom demonstrated in the past. furthermore, the
question remains as to whether survivin plays a dominant role in processing cytokinesis or inhibiting caspases activity in
cells treated with anti-mitotic compounds. the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of survivin on the resistance
and susceptibility of human cancer cells to microtubule de-stabilizer-induced cell death.
results: bpr0l075 is a ca-4 analog that induces microtubule de-polymerization and subsequent caspase-dependent
apoptosis. to study the relationship between the expression of survivin and the resistance to microtubule de-stabilizers,
a kb-derived bpr0l075-resistant cancer cell line, kb- xxxg1994xxx , was generated for this study. here, we found that survivin was
over-expressed in the kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells. down-regulation of survivin by sirna induced hyper-sensitivity to bpr0l075 in kb
cells and partially re-stored sensitivity to bpr0l075 in kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells. western blot analysis revealed that down-regulation
of survivin induced microtubule de-stabilization in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells. however, the same treatment did not
enhance the down-stream caspase-3/-7 activities in bpr0l075-treated kb cells. translocation of a caspase-independent
apoptosis-related molecule, apoptosis-inducing factor (aif), from cytoplasm to the nucleus was observed in survivintargeted kb cells under bpr0l075 treatment.
conclusion: in this study, survivin plays an important role in the stability of microtubules, but not with caspases
inhibition. over-expression of survivin counteracts the therapeutic effect of microtubule de-stabilizer bpr0l075
probably by stabilizing tubulin polymers, instead of the inhibition of caspase activity in cancer cells. besides microtubulerelated caspase-dependent cell death, caspase-independent mitotic cell death could be initiated in survivin/bpr0l075
combination treatments. we suggest that combining microtubule de-stabilizers with a survivin inhibitor may attribute to
a better clinical outcome than the use of anti-mitotic monotherapy in clinical situations.

background
microtubules are protein filaments of cytoskeleton composed of alpha-tubulin and  xxxg2353xxx  molecules [1,2]. in cells,
microtubule filaments rapidly alternate between phases of
growth and shrinkage (dynamic instability) during cell
cycle. since microtubules play crucial roles in the regulation of the mitotic apparatus, disruption of microtubules
can induce cell cycle arrest in m phase, the formation of
abnormal mitotic spindles, and final triggering of signals
for apoptosis. the discovery that the cytotoxic activity of
various compounds is through interference with the
mitotic spindle apparatus has attracted much attention
within the past two decades, and microtubules have
become an attractive pharmacologic target for anticancer
drug discovery [3,4]. anti-mitotic compounds such as vincristine, vinblastine (microtubule-destabilizing vinca
alkaloid) and paclitaxel (microtubule-stabilizing taxane)
have been developed to target cancers clinically [5-7].
although the taxanes and vinca alkaloids are effective for
the management of different malignancies, their potential
is limited by the development of multidrug resistance
(mdr) [8,9]. mdr is multi-factorial, with one pathway
leading to resistance mediated by over-expression of
transmembrane efflux pumps, namely, the mr 170,000 pglycoprotein (p- xxxg10xxx /mdr) and multidrug resistance
protein (mrp) [10]. therefore, there has been great interest in identifying novel microtubule inhibitors that can
overcome various modes of resistance and have improved
pharmacology profiles.
bpr0l075 [6-methoxy-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxy-benzoyl)1h-indole] is a novel synthetic compound discovered
through research to identify new microtubule inhibitors
in our laboratory. it is a heterocyclic  xxxd1744xxx  a-4
(ca-4) analog, which is derived from the south african
tree combretum caffrum, and inhibits tubulin polymerization by binding to tubulin at the colchicine-binding site
[11,12]. unlike traditional microtubule inhibitors such as
vincristine and paclitaxel, bpr0l075 is effective in suppressing cell growth of both mdr-positive and -negative
tumor cell lines [12]. bpr0l075 also induces microtubule
de-stabilization-related downstream processes such as
phosphorylation of bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3 [12].
in-vivo, bpr0l075 shows potent activity against the
growth of xenograft tumors of the gastric carcinoma
mkn-45, human cervical carcinoma kb, and kb-derived
p- xxxg10xxx /mdr-overexpressing kb-vin10 cells in nude
mice [12]. although bpr0l075 is a promising anticancer
compound that can be applied to the management of various malignancies, particularly for patients with mdrrelated drug resistance, its effectiveness in patients with
mdr-unrelated drug resistance is still unknown.
survivin is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis (iaps).
other than the expression of mdr, expression of survivin
has been related to the causation of cancer-drug resistance

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/43

in various studies [13-15]. at the molecular level, survivin
is a bifunctional protein that acts as a suppressor of apoptosis and plays a central role in cell division. it has been
suggested that survivin, possibly the mitochondrial fraction instead of the cytosol fraction, inhibits apoptosis
through interference with caspases [16-18]. a study using
surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy showed that survivin directly binds to caspase-3 and caspase-7 with
nanomolar affinity [16]. in confirmation, myc-tagged survivin bound caspase-3 and caspase-7 in immunoprecipitation studies [16]. survivin also promotes cell survival
through interference with cell cycle-related kinases and
microtubule networks. survivin binds to centromeres on
a para-polar axis during prophase/metaphase, relocates to
the spindle midzone during anaphase/telophase, and disappears at the end of telophase [19]. over-expression of
survivin reduced centrosomal microtubule nucleation
and suppressed both microtubule dynamics instability in
mitotic spindles and bidirectional growth of microtubules
in midbodies during cytokinesis [20]. in addition, it has
been shown that intracellular loading of a polyclonal antibody to survivin induced microtubule defects and
resulted in formation of multipolar mitotic spindles [21].
although over-expression of survivin has been suggested
to cause resistance to various chemotherapeutic compounds in cancers, survivin-induced resistance to microtubule de-stabilizers such as vinca alkaloids and
cochicine-related compounds in cancers was seldom demonstrated in the past [22]. furthermore, the question
remains as to whether survivin plays a dominant role in
processing cytokinesis or inhibiting caspases activity in
cells treated with anti-mitotic compounds. in fact, downregulation of survivin did not induce massive cell death in
hela cells [23]. however the process of cytokinesis was
heavily impaired by the same treatment [23]. in this
study, we have generated a microtubule de-stabilizer
bpr0l075-resistant cell line and shown for the first time
that down-regulation of survivin enhances sensitivity to
the microtubule de-stabilizing compound bpr0l075. we
further describe the role of survivin in interfering sensitivity to the microtubule de-stabilizer, bpr0l075, in human
oral carcinoma cells.

results
over-expression of survivin in both bpr0l075/colchicinetreated cancer cells and bpr0l075-resistant cancer cells
over-expression of survivin in response to anti-cancer
treatments has been demonstrated previously [24]. here,
we examined the level of survivin expression in response
to bpr0l075 treatment in various cancer cell lines.
human p53-wildtype kb and p53-mutated hone-1 cancer cell lines were used in this study. cells were treated
with 8 nm (ic50 value) of bpr0l075 for 24 h. cell lysate
was extracted and the expressions of various intracellular
proteins were analyzed by western blotting. a timedependent phosphorylation of  xxxg250xxx  in kb cells was shown

and this result was consistent with our previously published data (figure 1a) [12]. both un-treated cell lines
expressed survivin endogenously (figure 1a). in addition,
the treatment of bpr0l075 (8 nm) induced over-expression of survivin in a time-dependent manner in both cancer cell lines (figure 1a). surprisingly, over-expression of
a survivin negative-regulator, p53, in response to
bpr0l075 was also observed in kb cells in a time-dependent manner (figure 1a).
kb cells were chosen for further in vitro investigation, considering that the same cell line was chosen in our previously published report [12]. to determine whether overexpression of survivin was unique to bpr0l075 treatment, kb cells were treated with 10 nm (ic50 value) of colchicine (microtubule destabilizer) and intracellular
proteins were analyzed by western blotting. cells incubated with colchicine also induced over-expression of survivin in a time-dependent manner (figure 1a, bottom
panel). facs analysis was performed to determine
whether bpr0l075-induced over-expression of survivin
was caused by cell cycle arrest at the g2/m phase. kb cells
were treated with various concentrations of bpr0l075 for
24 h and nucleus was stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide.
although high concentrations (≥ 16 nm, 2 × ic50) of
bpr0l075 induced g2/m arrest, facs analysis clearly
showed no difference in the percentage of g2/m population between untreated-cells and cells treated with 8 nm
(ic50 value) of bpr0l075 (additional file 1).
to determine whether bpr0l075-induced over-expression of survivin in kb cells was caused by changes in the
rate of survivin gene transcription, rt-pcr was performed. as was observed for the protein, the level of survivin mrna transcripts was increased by approximately 3fold in kb cells after 24 h of bpr0l075 incubation (figure
1b). it has been suggested that p53 down-regulates the
expression survivin [25]. to determine whether p53 plays
a role in the bpr0l075-induced over-expression of survivin in kb cells, a p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha was used.
interestingly, western blot analysis revealed that co-incubation pifithrin-alpha was unable to increase the level of survivin expression in bpr0l075-treated kb cells (figure
1c). taken together, these results suggest that p53-indpendent over-expression of survivin may affect cancer
cells susceptibility to bpr0l075-induced cytotoxicity.
a kb-derived bpr0l075-resistant cancer cell line, kb- xxxg1994xxx ,
was recently generated in our laboratory. this drug-resistant cell line was shown to withstand 30 nm of bpr0l075
under culturing condition (data not shown). in addition,
this specific cell line showed resistance to colchicine in
vitro (data not shown). under bpr0l075-free conditions,
western blot analysis revealed that the baseline expression
of survivin was increased by approximate 2.3-fold in kbl30 cells, as compared to the drug-sensitive kb cells (fig-

ure 1d). real-time pcr also revealed that the level of survivin mrna transcripts was significantly increased by
approximate 80% (*p < 0.01) in the kb- xxxg1994xxx , as compared
to its drug-sensitive parental cells (figure 1e). facs analysis was performed to determine whether over-expression
of survivin in kb- xxxg1994xxx  was caused by cell cycle arrest at the
g2/m phase. kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells cultured under
bpr0l075-free coditions were stained with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide. facs analysis clearly showed no significant difference in the percentage of g2/m population between kb
(16.3%) and kb- xxxg1994xxx  (16.5%) cells (additional file 1).
taken together, the detection of high levels of survivin in
the bpr0l075-resistant kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells suggests that intracellular survivin may affect cancer cells susceptibility to
bpr0l075-induced cytotoxicity.
down-regulation of survivin increases sensitivity to
bpr0l075 and colchicine in cancer cells
to investigate the sensitivity of cancer cells to the microtubule de-stabilizer, bpr0l075, after inhibition of survivin, sirna was applied to down-regulate survivin in
cancer cell lines, and the level of cell viability was examined. cells were transfected with validated-sirna oligomers, sir-c (scramble control) or sir-s (survivin specific) by
liposomal reagent. down-regulation of survivin mrna
transcripts by sirna in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells after 36
h of transfection was confirmed by rt-pcr (fig. 2a). successful down-regulation of survivin protein by sir-s after
48 h of transfection was shown by immunofluorescence
microscopy (figure 2b). western blot analysis further
confirmed that survivin protein levels were successfully
down-regulated after 48 h of sirna transfection (figure
2c).

morphologically, the survivin-targeted kb cells became
round and slightly enlarged in size (figure 3a). although
down-regulation of survivin by sir-s induced morphological changes in kb cells under bpr0l075-free conditions
(figure 3a), the same treatment did not reduce cell viability (figure 3b). interestingly, down-regulation of survivin
by sir-s enhanced the sensitivity to bpr0l075 in kb cells
in vitro. co-treatment of sir-s and bpr0l075 significantly
reduced cell viability of kb by 17–31% among various
concentrations of bpr0l075 in vitro as compared to the
drug alone treatment (figure 3b).
we further examined the possibility of restoring the sensitivity to bpr0l075 by down-regulation of survivin in kbl30 cells. phase contrast microscopy and cell viability
studies showed that down-regulation of survivin did not
induce kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells cell death under bpr0l075-free conditions (figure 3c and 3d). in contrast, down-regulation
of survivin by sir-s induced massive cell death in kb- xxxg1994xxx 
cancer cells under normal culture conditions (30 nm of
bpr0l075) (figure 3c and 3d). co-treatment of sir-s
and bpr0l075 reduced the viability of kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells by

20–52% among various concentrations of bpr0l075 in
vitro as compared to the drug alone treatment (figure 3d).
we have previously demonstrated that colchicine induced
over-expression of survivin in kb cells (figure 1a). to
determine whether down-regulation of survivin by sirna
also increases the sensitivity to colchcine in kb and kbl30 cells, cells co-treated with sir-c/sir-s and colchicine
were analyzed by cell viability assay. interestingly, downregulation of survivin by sir-s enhanced the sensitivity to
colchicine in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells in vitro (figure 3e).
taken together, our results indicate that survivin plays an
important role in the sensitivity to microtubule de-stabilizers, bpr0l075 and colchicine, in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx 
cells.

in huvec cells [26]. therefore, microtubule polymerization status was investigated to determine whether survivin
counteracts the effectiveness of bpr0l075 by interfering
with the microtubule dynamics in kb cancer cells. soluble
and insoluble fractions of the cell lysate were extracted.
interestingly, survivin was not detected in the soluble fraction of both cell lines (figure 4a). the amount of insoluble survivin in kb- xxxg1994xxx  was increased by approximately
2.2-fold as compared to the bpr0l075-sensitive kb cells.
in correlation, the amounts of insoluble alpha – and  xxxg2353xxx 
were also increased in kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells (figure 4a). in contrast, the amounts of soluble alpha – and  xxxg2353xxx  were
decreased in kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells (figure 4a). these results reveal
a positive correlation between the expression of survivin
and stabilization of microtubule.

survivin interferes with microtubule dynamics
bpr0l075-induced de-stabilization of microtubule has
been shown in cancer cells [12]. on the other hand, stabilization of microtubule networks has been suggested to
induce drug-resistance of tubulin de-stabilizating agents

interaction between survivin expression and dynamic formation of the microtubule was shown by western blot
analysis. down-regulation of survivin by sir-s reduced
the amount of insoluble alpha-tubulin in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx 
cells (figure 4b and 4c). however, the same treatment did

not induce any changes in the general expression of alphatubulin (figure 4b and 4c). tubulin acetylation is considered to be a marker of microtubule stabilization [27,28].
in our study, western blot analysis revealed that down-regulation of survivin by sir-s reduced the amount of intracellular acetylated alpha-tubulin in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells,
as compared to sir-c treated control. the combination of
sir-s and 8 nm of bpr0l075 further reduced the amount
of acetylated alpha-tubulin, as compared to sir-s and drug
alone treatment in kb cells (figure 4d, top panel). in
addition, combination of sir-s and 70 nm of bpr0l075
also reduced the amount of acetylated alpha-tubulin, as compared to sir-s and drug alone treatment in kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells
(figure 4d, bottom panel). immunofluorescent microscopy was used to provide visualization of the microtubule
networks in cells. untreated kb cells showed intact microtubule networks (figure 4e). in contrast, down-regulation
of survivin by sir-s induced disorganization of the microtubule networks (figure 4e). furthermore, the combination of sir-s and 4 nm of bpr0l075 induced synergistic
microtubule depolarization and changes in cell morphology (figure 4e). these results indicate that survivin stabilizes the microtubule networks and possibly counteracts
the therapeutic effect of microtubule de-stabilizer,
bpr0l075, by stabilizing tubulin polymers.
inhibition of survivin enhances sensitivity to bpr0l075 via
caspase-3/-7 dependent/independent mechanisms
bpr0l075-induced microtubule de-stabilization and subsequent activation of caspase-3 has been shown in kb
cells previously [12]. here, real-time caspase-3/-7 activity
imaging was performed to determine whether de-stabilization of the microtubule networks by targeting survivin
enhances the sensitivity to bpr0l075 in cancer cells via
downstream caspase-3/-7 activations. cells pre-transfected with sir-c and sir-s were incubated with
bpr0l075 for various durations. the activities of caspases-3/-7 were measured with the magicred™ real-time
caspase-3/-7 detection kit, and nuclei were counterstained blue with a hoechst dye.

in bpr0l075-free conditions, caspase-3/-7 activities were
not detected in both cell lines (figure 5a and 5b). kb- xxxg1994xxx 
cells were normally cultured in media with the presence of
bpr0l075 (30 nm). in this condition, caspase-3/-7 activities were also not detected (figure 5b, middle row). in
contrast, high dose of bpr0l075 induced caspase-3/-7
activity in both kb (8 nm, ic50 value) and kb- xxxg1994xxx  (70 nm,
ic50 value) cells, as indicated by red fluorescence staining
of the cytoplasm of cells (figure 5a and 5b). inhibition of
survivin by sir-s did not induce caspase-3/-7 activities in
both cell lines under drug-free conditions (figure 5a and
5b). in addition, co-treatment of sir-s and 4 nm of
bpr0l075 did not enhance caspase-3/-7 activities in kb
cells, as compared to the bpr0l075 monotherapy at various time points (figure 5c). interestingly, down-regula-

tion of survivin induced caspase-3/-7 activities in
bpr0l075-cotreated kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells (figure 5b, middle
row). therefore, our results indicate that survivin directly
or indirectly interferes with the caspase-3/-7 in kb- xxxg1994xxx ,
but not in kb cells during bpr0l075 treatments.
activation of caspase-3/-7 induces dna fragmentation
[29,30]. nucleus degradation was observed with kb cells
treated with 16 nm (twice of ic50 value) of bpr0l075
after 72 h (data not shown). here, massive nucleus degradation was observed in the sir-s/bpr0l075-cotreated kbl30 cells (figure 5b, white arrows). in contrast, intact
nucleus was shown in the drug alone treatment (figure
5b). although caspase-3/-7 activities were not increased in
the combination treatment, increased degradation of
nucleus was shown in kb cells, as compared to the drug
alone treatment (figure 5a, white arrows). the early
appearance of dna fragmentation in kb cells under combination treatment was further confirmed by tunel assay
(figure 5d).
down-regulation of survivin induces translocation of
apoptosis-inducing factor in kb cells
dna fragmentation can be induced by caspase-independent mechanisms. apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) is a protein which induces large-scale dna fragmentation during
caspase-independent apoptosis [31,32]. the possibility
that sirna-mediated down-regulation of survivin would
lead to the translocation of aif was explored. kb cells
were treated with sir-c, sir-s, or drug bpr0l075 alone,
and aif expression was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-aif antibody. the cytoplasm of cells treated with sir-c for 48 h was stained green
with a ring-like pattern around the nucleus by the anti-aif
antibody, as was the cytoplasm of cells treated with
bpr0l075 (figure 6). in marked contrast, it was the
nucleus that was stained green by the anti-aif antibody in
cells treated with the sir-s against survivin, suggesting that
aif translocated from cytoplasm to the nucleus when survivin was targeted with sirna (figure 6). cells treated
with a combination of sir-s and bpr0l075 induced similar phenotype to sir-s mono-treatment (figure 6). thus,
caspase-independent cell death could be induced by
down-regulation of survivin in kb cells.

discussion
studies suggest that survivin contributes to chemo-resistance and enhances cell survival through two potential
mechanisms: 1) the inhibition of apoptosis by blocking
activated caspases [18,22], and 2) by stabilizing the
microtubule network to avert cell catastrophe [33]. these
two mechanisms exert different weights in the contribution to cancer cell survival, depending on the therapeutic
agent used and possibly the cancer type. for example, in
lung cancer, normura et al. demonstrated that inhibition
of apoptosis mediated by survivin contributed to cisplapage 8 of 15

tin-resistance [34]. in another study, zhang et al. showed
that that adenovirus-mediated inhibition of survivin
expression actually sensitized human prostate cancer cells
to paclitaxel [35]. their studies also suggested that survivin mediates resistance to paclitaxel through suppression of caspase-mediated apoptosis [15]. however,
another study revealed that survivin is required for stable
checkpoint activation in paclitaxel-treated hela cells [23].
down-regulation of survivin by sirna abrogated the ability of cells to sustain paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest
[23]. in addition, down-regulation of survivin alone did
not induce massive death in hela cells [23]. therefore,
question remains as to whether survivin plays a dominant

role in processing cytokinesis or inhibiting caspases activity in cells treated with anti-mitotic compounds. interestingly, survivin-induced resistant to microtubule destabilizers such as vinca alkalodis, cochicine and  xxxd1744xxx  a-4 related compounds in cancers was rarely demonstrated in the past [22]. in our study, we found that
survivin counteracts the therapeutic effect of microtubule
de-stabilizer, bpr0l075, by stabilizing tubulin polymers.
bpr0l075 is a novel anti-mitotic compound and its
mechanisms of action have been published elsewhere

survivin in response to bpr0l075 was shown in p53wildtype kb cells. interestingly, co-incubation of a p53inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha, was unable to increase the level of
survivin expression in bpr0l075-treated cells. in addition, over-expression of survivin in response to bpr0l075
was also observed in p53-mutated hone-1 cells. taken
together, our study suggested that bpr0l075 induces
overexpression of survivin through a p53-independent
pathway.

tion by binding to tubulin at the colchicine-binding site
[11,12]. in the current study, up-regulation of survivin in
response to bpr0l075 was observed in both p53-wildtype
kb and p53-mutated hone-1 cancer cells. in addition,
the baseline expression of survivin was also increased in
kb-derived bpr0l075-resistant kb- xxxg1994xxx , as compared to
its drug-sensitive parental cells. therefore, one important
aim of our study was to investigate whether survivin could
be potentially important in sensitivity to the microtubuledestabilizing compound, bpr0l075, especially in
bpr0l075-resistant cancer cells. here, we demonstrate
that down-regulation of survivin by sirna induced hypersensitivity to bpr0l075 in kb and partially restored sensitivity to the drug in bpr0l075-resistant kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells.
these results suggested for the first time that survivin plays
an important role in the sensitivity and resistant to the
microtubule de-stabilizer, bpr0l075. furthermore, p53 is
widely believed to be a negative regulator of survivin
expression [25,36-41]. however, our current results indicate that whether p53 plays a definite role in survivin regulation under various chemo-stresses remains agurable.
in our study, dose-dependent co-expression of p53 and

it has been reported that vegf-induced expression of survivin preserved the microtubule integrity and stabilization
of the microtubule networks subsequently induced drugresistance to both  xxxd1709xxx  and paclitaxel in huvec cells
[33]. a role for altered microtubule polymer levels in vincristine resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukemia has
also been demonstrated in vivo [26]. in the present study,
increased tubulin polymer levels were observed in the
bpr0l075-resistant kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells as compared to its drugsensitive parental cells. we also demostrated that downregulation of survivin de-stabilizes tubulin polymers in
both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cancer cells. in addition, the level of
acetylated alpha-tubulin was synergistically reduced in the
survivin/bpr0l075 combination therapy as compared to
the monotherapy in kb cells. thus, the over-expression of
survivin in response to the microtubule de-stabilizer
bpr0l075 reflects one of the possible cell survival mechanisms by stabilizing microtubule. it is also worth noting
that over-expression of survivin was observed in both colchicine- and vincristine-treated kb cells (data not shown).
in addition, kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells are relatively more sensitive to
paclitaxel (microtubule stabilizer) and at the same time
more resistant to both colchicine and vincristine (microtubule de-stabilizers), as compare to their parental cells
(data not shown). interestingly, ong et al's study also
revealed that a vincristine-resistant xenograft with high
levels of polymerized tubulin was relatively sensitive to
the microtubule-polymerizing drug paclitaxel [26].
indeed, further investigations are needed to determine the
relationships between the survivin-interfered microtubule
dynamics and the resistance to various microtubule destabilizers in depth.
although various studies reveal that survivin interferes
with cytokinesis and inhibits caspases during apoptosis,
the question remains as to whether survivin plays a dominant role in regulating cell cycle or inhibiting cell death.
in fact, down-regulation of survivin did not induce massive cell death in hela cells [23]. however, the process of
cytokinesis was heavily impaired by the same treatment
[23]. in the present study, down-regulation of survivin did
not induce cell death in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells under
bpr0l075-free conditions. in accord with the results from
cell viability study, down-regulation of survivin did not
induce caspase-3/-7 activities in both kb and kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells
cultured under drug-free conditions. it is widely believed
page 10 of 15

molecular cancer 2009, 8:43

that anti-mitotic compounds induce mitotic arrest by activating the spindle checkpoint and these molecular
changes subsequently activate caspase-dependent apoptosis. our previous study agreed with that hypothesis as the
microtubule de-stabilizer, bpr0l075, induced activation
of caspase-3 in various cancer cell lines [12]. interestingly,
down-regulation of survivin did not enhance caspase-3/-7
activities in the survivin/bpr0l075 co-treated kb cells,
given that the microtubule dynamics were heavily
impaired in the same treatment. these results suggested
that survivin functions predominantly in microtubule stabilization or mitotic progression, as opposed to inhibition of caspase-dependent cell death in kb cells under
bpr0l075-free conditions. however, down-regulation of
survivin induced caspase-3/-7 activities in the survivin/
bpr0l075 co-treated kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells. therefore, whether
survivin interferes with the caspase-3/-7 during bpr0l075
treatment seems to be cell type dependent. furthermore,
incomplete restoration to the drug sensitivity in survivin
down-regulated kb- xxxg1994xxx  cells indicates that other important drug resistance mechanisms may co-exist.
as we mentioned earlier, it is believed that anti-mitotic
compounds induce mitotic arrest by activating the spindle
checkpoint and these molecular changes subsequently
activate caspase-dependent apoptosis. however, our current study reveals that down-regulation of survivin synergistically affects the microtubule dynamics and cell
viability without significant induction in caspases activity.
in addition, increased dna fragmentation and nucleus
degradation were observed in the survivin/bpr0l075
combination treatments, as compared to the bpr0l075
monotherapy. therefore, down-regulation of survivin
together with bpr0l075 may initiate caspase-independent dna fragmentation and cell death in kb cells. during
one form of caspase-independent apoptosis, apoptosisinducing factor (aif) translocates from the mitochondria
to the nucleus [42-44]. aif is a flavoprotein that is normally confined to the mitochondrial intermembrane
space, but induces chromatin condensation and fragmentation of dna into high molecular weight forms of >50 kb
when it translocates to the nucleus [31,32]. it has been
suggested that survivin interferes with the translocation of
aif. in fact, translocation of aif from the mitochondria to
the nucleus was shown in yusac2 melanoma cells
treated with a cell-permeable dominant-negative survivin
protein [45]. furthermore, involvement of aif in  xxxd2745xxx  (microtubule de-stabilizer)-induced caspase-independent mitotic cell death was also demostrated
perviosuly [46]. in niikura et al.'s study, treatment with
 xxxd2745xxx  or paclitaxel induced kinetochore-microtubule detachement, mitotic arrest and subsequent aifinvolved caspase-independent cell death in cancer cells
[46]. in our study, translocation of aif from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following the down-regulation of
survivin indicates that survivin inhibits caspase-independ-

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/43

ent apoptosis in kb cells. thus, both caspase-dependent
and caspase-independent dna fragmentation could be
co-operated in kb cells during survivin-targeted
bpr0l075 combination treatments. these results suggested that down-regulation of survivn together with
microtubule de-stabilizers may induces caspase-independent mitotic cell death, possible through aif activation. however, our study could not determine the rate of
aif activity between survivin monotherapy and survivin/
bpr0l075 combination. further investigation is needed
to determine the level of aif activities between different
treatments.

conclusion
drug resistance is a common problem in the management
of neoplastic diseases. the effectiveness of a single anticancer agent is limited by the fact that drug resistance
mechanisms can be introduced by cancer cells during cell
evolution or re-arrangement of tumor micro-environment. in clinical situations, rather than treating patients
with a single anti-cancer agent, combination therapies are
preferred. bpr0l075 is a tubulin-targeting compound
capable of inducing cytotoxic effect among various mdrpositive/-negative cancers both in vitro and in vivo. downregulation of survivin with an anti-sense survivin gene
enhances the sensitivity to the dna damaging agent, cisplatin, which in kb have been demonstrated both in vitro
and in vivo previously [14]. however, the underlying
molecular mechanisms of the drug resistant to antimitotic agents, especially for the microtubule de-stabilizing compounds, have not been discussed in detail. here,
we have shown that survivin counteracts the therapeutic
effect of microtubule de-stabilizer, bpr0l075, by stabilizing tubulin polymers in human kb oral carcinoma cells.
since survivin plays an important role in the sensitivity of
microtubule de-stabilizing agents, the use of survivin-targeted agents such as oxaliplatin and spc3042 (santaris
pharma) in anti-mitotic combination therapy maybe of
clinical benefit [47,48]. also, unlike other potential therapeutic targets, survivin is expressed in few adult tissues.
thus, survivin-specific combination therapy is likely to
produce few adverse effects.

(gibco, grand island, ny), supplemented with 5% fetal
bovine serum, penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100
mug/ml) and l-glutamine (0.29 mg/ml), at 37°c. the
antibodies used in this study included: a mouse anti-alpha
tubulin antibody (upstate cell signaling, lake placid,
ny), a mouse anti-beta tubulin antibody (bd pharmingen,
franklin lakes, nj), a mouse anti-actin antibody (santa

rabbit anti-aif antibody (r&d systems, minneapolis,
mn), a mouse anti- xxxg250xxx  antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca).
establishment of the kb-derived bpr0l075-resistant cell
line
human oral carcinoma cells (kb) were cultured in rpmi
1640 medium as previously described. bpr0l075-resistant cells were established from kb cells by exposure to
increasing concentrations of bpr0l075. briefly, kb cells
were initially incubated in completed medium containing
5nm of bpr0l075 that yielded 40% cell survival for a
period of 3~4 weeks, and the cells that proliferated were
repeatedly subcultured in completed medium containing
increasing concentrations of the drug (a 20% increment
each time). cells that grew exponentially in the presence
of 30 nm of bpr0l075 were obtained and subcloned by
dilution plating in 48-well plates. individual clones were
isolated. for maintenance, these subclones were cultured
under conditions similar to those used for kb, except for
an addition of bpr0l075 (30 nm).
rt-pcr
total rna was extracted with using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and complementary dna was synthesized from rna with the superscript™ first-strand

pcr condition was as follows: 1 cycle of initial denaturation at 95°c for 10 min, 45 cycles of amplification at
95°c for 10 s, 60°c for 30 s, and 72°c for 1 s, with a single fluorescence acquisition.  xxxg861xxx  gene was used as an
internal control.
sirna
target-validated sirna oligos (santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca) were transfected into cells using the lipofectamine-2000 reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca).
briefly, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or chamberslides, and cultured overnight in 100 mul of antibiotic-free
rpmi media. sirna oligomers (8 pmol in 0.4 mul) were
diluted in 25 mul of opti-mem® i medium (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca) without serum, and then mixed with 0.2 mul
of lipofectamine-2000 transfection reagent for 25 min at
room temperature. cells were overlaid with the transfection mixture, and incubated for various times.
sds-page and western blot analysis
cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm tris, 1
mm edta, 1 mm dtt, 60 mm kcl, 0.5% np-40 and protease inhibitors). total cell lysates, fractions of supernatant or pellet were resolved on 10% and 12%
polyacrylamide sds gels under reducing conditions. the
resolved-proteins were electrophoretically transferred to
pvdf membranes (amersham life science, amersham,
u.k.) for western blot analysis. the membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder at room temperature for two hours, washed twice with pbst (1% tween)
and then incubated with primary antibody for 90 minutes
at room temperature. the membranes were washed twice
with pbst then subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution
at 1:10000, santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca).
immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham international, buckingham, u.k.)
and autoradiography.
mtt cell viability assay
3 × 103 cells in 100 mul of drug-free culturing medium were
seeded onto 96-well plates for 24 hours before treatments.
cells were then treated with various concentration of
bpr0l075 for 72 hours. 25 mul of mtt (5 mg/ml) was
added into each sample and incubated for 4 hours, under
5% co2 and 37°c. 100 mul of lysis buffer (20% sds, 50%
dmf) was subsequently added into each sample and further reacted for 16 hours. ic50 value resulting from 50%
inhibition of cell growth was calculated graphically as a
comparison with control growth.
