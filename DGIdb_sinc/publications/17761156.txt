abstract
cytokines interleukin (il)-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. il-12 causes diﬀerentiation of cd4+ t cells
to interferon-c (ifn-c)-producing t helper 1 (th1) cells, while  xxxd3038xxx  induces diﬀerentiation to  xxxg1166xxx -producing pathogenic th17 cells.
the eﬀects of the monoclonal antibody to il-12/23 p40 subunit ( xxxd3480xxx ) on il-12 receptor (il-12r) expression, markers associated
with skin homing, activation, and cytokine secretion were investigated in vitro using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs)
from healthy donors. pbmcs were activated in the presence or absence of recombinant human (rh) il-12 or rhil-23, with or without
 xxxd3480xxx .  xxxd3480xxx  inhibited upregulation of cla, il-12r, il-2ra and  xxxg390xxx  expression and also inhibited il-12- and il-23induced ifn-c,  xxxg1166xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a, il-2, and il-10 secretion. thus, the therapeutic eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  may be
attributed to the il-12/23 neutralization, resulting in decreased expression of skin homing and activation markers, and il-12- and il-23induced cytokine secretion.

1. introduction
psoriasis is a chronic, t cell-mediated, inﬂammatory
skin disease aﬀecting approximately 1–3% of the world’s
population [1,2]. both interleukin (il)-121 and  xxxd3038xxx  are
known to be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis [2–
5], as well as other autoimmune diseases [6–8]. il-12 is
composed of the subunits p35/p40, while  xxxd3038xxx  is composed of the subunits p19/p40. both cytokines bind via

the p40 subunit to the il-12 receptor b1 (il-12rb1)
located on the surface of t and natural killer (nk) cells
[6]. the unique subunits of il-12 (p35) and  xxxd3038xxx  (p19)
bind to distinct receptors, il-12rb2 and il-23r, respectively [9]. while il-12rb1 subunit is the ligand binding
subunit, il-12rb2 is the intra-cellular signaling component
of the il-12r complex, but both subunits are necessary for
high aﬃnity binding to il-12 [10]. similar to il-12rb2, il23r is not detected on resting naı̈ve t cells, but is induced
rapidly upon activation [11]. il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  receptor
binding initiates the respective cytokine-signaling cascades
of il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx .
the role of il-12 in psoriasis including t cell diﬀerentiation towards th1 cytokine producing cells and facilitating
t cell homing to the skin via induction of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (cla) has been well documented
[3,12,13]. less than 20% of peripheral blood t cells express

cla, while the majority of eﬀector memory t cells in normal skin (under resting conditions) are cla positive
[14,15]. about 85% of t cells inﬁltrating psoriatic lesions
and <5% of t cells in extracutaneous sites express cla
[14,16]. evolving psoriatic lesions are reported to be
enriched with cla+ t cells preceding epidermal hyperproliferation. also, a positive correlation was shown between
disease severity and frequency of cla expressing t cells
in peripheral blood and lesions in psoriatic patients [13].
several other activation (cd25) [17], co-stimulatory
( xxxg390xxx ) [18], and chemokine receptors (cxcr3)
[19,20] have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis.
in addition to cell surface expression markers, a complex network of stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines has
been associated with psoriatic lesions with elevated levels
of il-12 (p40),  xxxd3038xxx , interferon-gamma (ifn-c),  xxxg1166xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx  ( xxxg2296xxx ), il-10,  xxxg1180xxx ,
il-1, il-2, il-6, and il-8 [3,13,21–24]. recently,  xxxd3038xxx 
has also been reported as a key cytokine in the chronic
inﬂammation associated with psoriasis mediated by the
 xxxd3038xxx -induced pro-inﬂammatory cytokine,  xxxg1166xxx  [4,25].
also, chan et al. showed that injection of  xxxd3038xxx  into the
skin of mice promoted greater epidermal thickness than
the injection of il-12 [24]. further, zheng et al. indicated
that il-12 injections resulted in increased ifn-c levels,
whereas  xxxd3038xxx  increased the levels of  xxxg1166xxx , il-22, and
other cytokines, but not ifn-c [26]. therefore, a therapy
based on the neutralization of the common subunit of
il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  (p40) should alter the downstream cytokine induction pathways leading to improved clinical eﬃcacy in the treatment of psoriasis.
the ﬁrst-in-human phase i [27] and phase ii [28] clinical
trials using the fully human igg1 monoclonal antibody
speciﬁc for the p40 subunit of il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx , designated
 xxxd3480xxx  (centocor, inc., malvern, pa), showed a signiﬁcant improvement in psoriatic lesions in patients with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis;  xxxd3480xxx  binds to the
il-12/23 p40 subunit with high aﬃnity, thereby blocking
the il-12rb1 receptor binding and preventing subsequent
il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  receptor mediated signaling. the study
presented here focused on the in vitro eﬀects of cnto
1275 on pro-inﬂammatory (ifn-c,  xxxg1166xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx ) and
anti-inﬂammatory (il-10 and  xxxg1180xxx ) cytokine secretion by
polyclonal activators in the presence of exogenous il-12
and  xxxd3038xxx .  xxxd3480xxx  was shown to neutralize il-12
and  xxxd3038xxx  in activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), which resulted in decreased expression
of cla, cd25,  xxxg390xxx , and il-12r, and inhibition of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokine secretion. in the current study,
we show that il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  exert diﬀerential cytokine
secretion proﬁles and induction of t cell markers indicating
that regardless of their individual contributions, targeting
both cytokines may be a more eﬀective therapeutic strategy. notable clinical eﬃcacy data from psoriasis phase i
[27] and phase ii [28] clinical studies using  xxxd3480xxx 
in psoriasis, supports this strategy.

2. results
2.1. recombinant human il-12 (rhil-12)-induced
upregulation of cla expression on activated t cells is
inhibited by cnto1275
to determine the eﬀects of  xxxd3480xxx  on rhil-12induced expression of cla, pbmcs were isolated from
healthy donors and stimulated in vitro with either the mitogen phytohemaglutinin (pha),  xxxd2676xxx  + anti-cd28 (acd3 + a-cd28), or the superantigen staphylococcus
enterotoxin b (seb), in the presence or absence of exogenous rhil-12 or rhil-23, and with or without  xxxd3480xxx .
expression of cla was increased by activation and further
increased by the addition of exogenous rhil-12, and inhibited by  xxxd3480xxx  (fig. 1a). the induction of cla
expression was speciﬁc for il-12 because  xxxd3038xxx  (fig. 1b),
il-6, and  xxxg2296xxx  did not aﬀect cla expression (data not
shown). co-stimulation of pbmcs with pha and rhil12 enhanced cla expression by 30% compared with
unstimulated (non-pha activated or non-il-12 activated)
levels, as measured by percent positive cells (fig. 2a) and
antigen density (mean ﬂuorescent intensity, mfi; fig. 2b).
the addition of  xxxd3480xxx  to the pbmc cultures
inhibited the expression of cla induced by pha and
rhil-12 (fig. 1a and fig. 2a), and decreased its antigen
density (mfi; p = 0.056; fig. 2b). pre-blocking of cnto
1275 with a neutralizing anti-idiotypic antibody (nab)
(cnto 1438, centocor) speciﬁc to  xxxd3480xxx  fully
reversed the inhibitory eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  (mfi;
p = 0.034; fig. 2b), whereas a non-nab (cnto 8612,
centocor) did not alter the inhibitory eﬀects of cnto
1275 (fig. 2a and b). when pbmcs were activated with
a-cd3 + a-cd28 and rhil-12, similar inhibitory eﬀects
of  xxxd3480xxx  were observed (p = 0.002; data not shown).
additionally, seb alone induced signiﬁcant cla expression that was inhibited by  xxxd3480xxx , with or without
exogenous rhil-12 (p = 0.048 and 0.027, respectively), as
superantigens themselves are potent inducers of il-12
(data not shown).
2.2. eﬀects of  xxxd3480xxx  on il-12r expression
to determine the eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  on il-12r
expression, pbmcs were activated with pha in the presence or absence of rhil-12, with or without preincubation
with  xxxd3480xxx . while unstimulated t cells expressed
moderate levels of il-12rb1 and very low to undetectable
levels of il-12rb2, activation with pha (and also acd3 + a-cd28 or seb; data not shown) upregulated
expression of both il-12rb1 (fig. 3a) and il-12rb2
(fig. 3b). as expected, pha and exogenous rhil-12
(fig. 3c) had a negligible eﬀect on il-12rb1 expression
(p = 0.372) and signiﬁcantly increased il-12rb2 receptor
expression by >30% compared with unstimulated levels
(p = 0.006). the addition of  xxxd3480xxx  had a negligible
eﬀect on il-12rb1 expression (p = 0.690), but signiﬁcantly

fig. 1. rhil-12-induced upregulation of cla expression on activated t cells. dot plots of cd3 vs. cla indicating percent cd3+cla+ t cells in the
upper right quadrants are shown from 1 representative donor of 20 donors examined. percent cd3+cla+ t cells upon stimulation with (a) pha; (b)

isotype antibodies.

decreased rhil-12-induced il-12rb2 expression by 25%
compared with pha plus rhil-12 (p = 0.002). additionally, the inhibition of il-12rb2 expression caused by
 xxxd3480xxx  was reversed with nab pretreatment
(p < 0.034), indicating the speciﬁcity of  xxxd3480xxx  inhibition of il-12-induced il-12rb2 upregulation.

2.3.  xxxd3480xxx  decreased cell surface expression of cd25,
 xxxg390xxx , and cxcr3
the eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  on cell surface expression of
cd25,  xxxg390xxx , and cxcr3 markers was evaluated following treatment with rhil-12 alone and in combination
with pha (fig. 4a and c) or a-cd3 + a-cd28 (fig. 4b).
pbmcs stimulated with rhil-12 alone expressed very low
levels of cd25 (fig. 4a), undetectable levels of  xxxg390xxx 
(data not shown), and moderate levels of cxcr3
(fig. 4c). a combination of stimulating agent with exogenous rhil-12; however, caused signiﬁcant upregulation of
cd25 (p < 0.001; fig. 4a) and  xxxg390xxx  (p = 0.002;
fig. 4b) expression compared with stimulation alone.
 xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly decreased rhil-12-induced
cd25 (p = 0.009) and  xxxg390xxx  (p < 0.001) expression compared with stimulation plus rhil-12. the inhibitory eﬀect
of ctno 1275 on cd25 expression was overcome by the
nab to  xxxd3480xxx  (p = 0.004). exogenous rhil-12 min-

imally aﬀected cxcr3 expression, and as a result, was not
aﬀected by  xxxd3480xxx  (fig. 4c).

2.4.  xxxd3480xxx  inhibition of rhil-12/rhil-23-induced
ifn-c and  xxxg1166xxx  in mitogen-stimulated pbmcs
apart from cell surface markers inﬂuenced by il-12, we
also measured the pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in the supernatants of these pbmc cultures.
we observed that unstimulated cells expressed belowdetectable levels of cytokines per manufacturer’s instructions (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) (<31.2 pg/ml of
il-12p40; <15.6 pg/ml of ifn-c; <31.2 pg/ml of  xxxg1166xxx ; <15.6 pg/ml of  xxxg2296xxx ; <7.8 pg/ml of il-10;
<7.8 pg/ml of  xxxg1180xxx ; and <31.2 pg/ml of il-2; data not
shown), whereas stimulation with a-cd3 + a-cd28, or
pha, or seb increased the levels of these cytokines.
stimulation with pha increased the secretion of ifn-c
in pbmcs collected from healthy donors, and this eﬀect
was signiﬁcantly inhibited by  xxxd3480xxx  (p = 0.008;
fig. 5a). exogenous rhil-12 signiﬁcantly increased ifn-c
secretion compared with stimulation alone (p < 0.001),
while treatment with  xxxd3480xxx  in the presence of
rhil-12 signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of ifn-c secretion (p < 0.001). the addition of nab reversed the eﬀects
of  xxxd3480xxx  on ifn-c secretion (p < 0.001). exogenous

fig. 2. speciﬁcity of inhibition of cla expression by  xxxd3480xxx . (a) pha and rhil-12-induced expression of cla measured as percent positive cells
and (b) antigen density (mean ﬂuorescent intensity, mfi). data represent means ± sd of cla+ expression (percent positive or antigen density; gated on
cd3 population) from one experiment of 4 healthy donors representative of the results from eight experiments using a total of 20 patients. statistically
signiﬁcant p-values are reported.

rhil-23 increased ifn-c secretion to a much lesser extent
than exogenous rhil-12 and was not statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.523). however,  xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly
decreased the levels of ifn-c secretion in the presence of
rhil-23 compared to stimulation plus  xxxd3038xxx  alone
(p = 0.001). this eﬀect was partially restored by the addition of nab, although statistical signiﬁcance could not
be established.
we also studied the eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  on another
pro-inﬂammatory cytokine,  xxxg1166xxx , which is primarily
induced by  xxxd3038xxx . the addition of  xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly decreased  xxxg1166xxx  secretion induced by pha stimulation alone (p < 0.001; fig. 5b). exogenous il-12 also
caused a signiﬁcant reduction of  xxxg1166xxx  secretion compared with stimulation alone (p < 0.001), but was not
aﬀected by the addition of  xxxd3480xxx  (p = 0.463). however, in the presence of nab, the levels of  xxxg1166xxx  signiﬁcantly increased compared with stimulation plus rhil-12
plus  xxxd3480xxx  (p < 0.001), indicating a possible il-23mediated eﬀect. treatment with rhil-23 led to greater
 xxxg1166xxx  secretion than did treatment with pha stimulation
alone (p = 0.001).  xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly decreased il-

23-induced  xxxg1166xxx  secretion (p < 0.001) compared to stimulation plus  xxxd3038xxx  alone, and this eﬀect was overcome by
the addition of nab (p = 0.032).
2.5. eﬀects of  xxxd3480xxx  on a-cd3 + a-cd28- and il-12or  xxxd3038xxx -induced pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine secretion
we also investigated the eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  on the
cytokine proﬁle resulting from cd3 receptor cross-linking
with cd28 co-stimulation in the presence of il-12 or  xxxd3038xxx 
in pbmcs isolated from a range of 6–10 healthy donors.
as shown in fig. 6, a-cd3 + a-cd28 alone induced secretion of all the cytokines examined. the addition of cnto
1275 signiﬁcantly decreased a-cd3 + a-cd28-induced
secretion of ifn-c compared with stimulation alone
(p < 0.001; fig. 6a). exogenous rhil-12 signiﬁcantly
increased secretion of ifn-c compared with stimulation
alone (p < 0.001); however, when  xxxd3480xxx  was added
in the presence of rhil-12, the levels of ifn-c signiﬁcantly
decreased (p < 0.001) to levels similar to stimulation alone.
in the presence of nab, the inhibitory eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx

represents pha + il-12, and the thick gray line represents  xxxd3480xxx  inhibition. (c) percent positive t cells expressing il-12rb1 or il-12rb2. shown
are the data from one experiment of 4 healthy donors representative of the results from eight experiments using a total of 16 normal healthy donors.
statistically signiﬁcant p-values are reported.

on il-12 was overcome and secretion of ifn-c increased
signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001). unlike the signiﬁcant increase in
ifn-c levels in the presence of rhil-12, the addition of
rhil-23 alone to a-cd3 + a-cd28-stimulated cells had lesser, although signiﬁcant eﬀect on ifn-c secretion levels
(p = 0.031) the addition of  xxxd3480xxx  in combination
with rhil-23 signiﬁcantly decreased ifn-c secretion
(p < 0.001), which was reversed by the addition of nab
(p = 0.008).
in contrast to ifn-c secretion, levels of  xxxg1166xxx  secretion were observed upon a-cd3 + a-cd28 stimulation,
which were less aﬀected by the addition of  xxxd3480xxx 
(p = 0.054; fig. 6b). exogenous rhil-12 did not aﬀect this
response any further (p = 0.358) and therefore, was not
inﬂuenced by  xxxd3480xxx  (p = 0.112). similarly, there
was no diﬀerence in the levels of  xxxg1166xxx  secretion when
nab was added (p = 0.132). on the contrary, treatment
with rhil-23 signiﬁcantly increased  xxxg1166xxx  secretion compared with stimulation alone (p = 0.004), and the addition
of  xxxd3480xxx  resulted in signiﬁcantly lower  xxxg1166xxx  secre-

tion than rhil-23 alone (p = 0.025). the addition of nab
did not completely reverse the inhibitory eﬀect of cnto
1275 on  xxxd3038xxx -induced  xxxg1166xxx  secretion (p = 0.073).
we further examined the eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  on antiinﬂammatory cytokine secretion in vitro using a-cd3 +
a-cd28 stimulation. the proﬁle for il-10 secretion
(fig. 6c) was similar to that observed for ifn-c, though
not as dramatic.  xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly decreased il-10
secretion compared with a-cd3 + a-cd28-stimulated cells
(p < 0.001). exogenous il-12 signiﬁcantly increased il-10
secretion compared with stimulation alone (p = 0.005),
which was inhibited by  xxxd3480xxx  (p < 0.001), and
reversed by nab (p = 0.006). on the contrary, rhil-23 did
not show an additive eﬀect on activation-induced il-10
secretion (p = 0.389). however,  xxxd3480xxx  in the presence
of rhil-23 and stimulation signiﬁcantly decreased il-10
secretion compared with stimulation plus  xxxd3038xxx 
(p < 0.001). this decrease was partially reversed by nab
(p = 0.410), indicating an  xxxd3038xxx -independent, but stimulation-induced il-12-dependent eﬀect on il-10 secretion.

evaluated in the presence of polyclonal activators (pha or a-cd3 + a-cd28), with or without exogenous rhil-12, in the presence or absence of cnto
1275. speciﬁcity of  xxxd3480xxx  is indicated with nab. shown are the data from one experiment of 4 healthy donors with the results from statistical
analysis on data pooled from eight experiments using a total of 16 normal healthy donors. statistically signiﬁcant p-values are reported.

in contrast to the other cytokines described previously,
the addition of  xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly increased acd3 + a-cd28-induced  xxxg1180xxx  secretion compared with
stimulation alone (p = 0.009; fig. 6d), while rhil-12 signif-

icantly decreased this secretion (p = 0.004). the addition of
 xxxd3480xxx  reversed the inhibitory eﬀect of rhil-12 on  xxxg1180xxx  secretion (p = 0.003). further, nab neutralized the eﬀect
of  xxxd3480xxx , resulting in a signiﬁcant decrease in  xxxg1180xxx

secretion (p = 0.001). as observed with most of the other
cytokines, the addition of rhil-23 alone resulted in no
change in  xxxg1180xxx  secretion from stimulation alone
(p = 0.165).  xxxd3480xxx  in the presence of rhil-23
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in  xxxg1180xxx  expression compared with stimulation plus  xxxd3038xxx  (p = 0.002); however, a
decrease in  xxxg1180xxx  secretion was observed when nab was
added in the presence of  xxxd3038xxx  and  xxxd3480xxx 
(p = 0.085), indicating the eﬀect of il-12, but not  xxxd3038xxx ,
on  xxxg1180xxx  inhibition.
the eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  on other pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines (il-2 and  xxxg2296xxx ) was similar to that of ifn-c
(data not shown).  xxxd3480xxx  inhibited both activation
and exogenous il-12-induced secretion of il-2 and  xxxg2296xxx . we also detected il-12p40, but not il-12p70 in cell cultures treated with stimulating agent alone, which explains
the decreases observed with  xxxd3480xxx  treatment in the
absence of exogenous il-12 (data not shown).
3. discussion
il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  are key immunoregulatory cytokines
that coordinate innate and adaptive immune responses.
il-12 plays a central role in inducing and maintaining
th1 type immune responses, while  xxxd3038xxx  recently emerged
as a late-stage eﬀector cytokine responsible for maintaining
chronic autoimmune inﬂammation through induction of
 xxxg1166xxx  and direct activation of macrophages [29]. the concerted action and balanced expression of il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx 
are crucial to maintaining an eﬀective cell-mediated
response. abnormal regulation of il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  is associated with several immune mediated inﬂammatory diseases [30–33], including psoriasis [4,24]; therefore,
targeting both of these cytokines may prove to be eﬀective
for the treatment of psoriasis. a fully human monoclonal
antibody that targets the p40 subunit of both il-12 and
 xxxd3038xxx  has shown appreciable clinical eﬃcacy in patients
with psoriasis [27,28]. in the current study we described
the in vitro eﬀects of  xxxd3480xxx  on cell surface markers
and cytokines inﬂuenced by il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  that are associated with psoriasis pathogenesis.
il-12 has been reported to direct t cells to the skin via
induction of cla expression, with accumulation of these t
cells preceding epidermal hyperproliferation [12]. however,
a recent report by clark et al. [15] indicated that the majority of t cells in normal skin are cla+ eﬀector memory t
cells suﬃcient for the development of psoriatic lesions.
these observations suggest that recruitment of additional
cla+ t cells from circulation may not be obligatory for
psoriasis lesion formation, but is believed to be associated
with perpetuation of cutaneous inﬂammatory responses. it
has been reported that il-12 substantially increased cla
and cd25 expression on activated t cells in normal volunteers [35] and psoriatic patients [16]. we have shown in this
study that polyclonal activation and exogenous rhil-12
(but not rhil-23) induced overexpression of cla and
cd25, and that this activity was downregulated by cnto

1275. the inhibitory eﬀects of  xxxd3480xxx  were speciﬁc for
blocking il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  activity, as an antibody speciﬁc
for the variable region reversed this inhibitory eﬀect of
 xxxd3480xxx . the direct eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  in vitro was
demonstrated clinically as a reduction of cla and cd25
in peripheral blood and biopsies from  xxxd3480xxx -treated
patients in a phase ii clinical study (manuscript in
preparation).
responsiveness to il-12 or  xxxd3038xxx  is mediated via their
respective receptor complexes. also, it had been reported
previously that both subunits of il-12r (b1 and b2) were
rapidly induced upon polyclonal activation [36]. in the
present study, we demonstrated down-modulation of activation, and il-12-induced upregulation of il-12 receptors
by  xxxd3480xxx . further, rhil-12-induced  xxxg390xxx  expression reported in this study supports the observation that
expression of  xxxg390xxx  by eﬀector cells is regulated by il12 and ifn-c [37]. because  xxxg390xxx -triggered signals are
implicated in the early stages of psoriatic lesion formation,
il-12 neutralization of  xxxg390xxx  expression may contribute
to the therapeutic beneﬁt of  xxxd3480xxx  treatment.
psoriasis is characterized by activation of th1 cytokines, and psoriatic lesions typically have elevated expression levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (ifn-c, il-2,
and  xxxg2296xxx ), while expression levels of anti-inﬂammatory
cytokines (il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and il-10) is minimal [4,34,38]. also,
serum levels of  xxxg2296xxx , ifn-c, il-6, il-8, and il-12 are
elevated in patients with active psoriasis compared with
healthy patients [39]. the reduction of il-12 and ifn-c
was shown to play a role in the resolution of psoriatic
symptoms following treatment with  xxxd3480xxx  [40], as
well as other therapies [41,42]. we showed signiﬁcant
reduction of rhil-12 and rhil-23-induced ifn-c secretion
by  xxxd3480xxx  in an in vitro system, consistent with ﬁndings from a phase i clinical study that reported reduction of
ifn-c and  xxxg2296xxx  mrna levels two weeks following
treatment with  xxxd3480xxx  [40]. also consistent with this
in vivo report was the reduction in il-12-induced  xxxg2296xxx 
by  xxxd3480xxx  observed in our study (data not shown).
apart from ifn-c and  xxxg2296xxx , we also observed inhibition
of the secretion of other pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
including il-2 (data not shown) and more importantly,
 xxxg1166xxx , in the presence of  xxxd3480xxx .
an upregulated  xxxd3038xxx -induced  xxxg1166xxx  immune response
is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of several
autoimmune diseases [43–45]. we observed the induction
of  xxxg1166xxx  following stimulation of t cell receptors by acd3 + a-cd28, which corroborated ﬁndings from a recent
study [46]. in the current study, the addition of exogenous
rhil-23, but not rhil-12, enhanced the induction of  xxxg1166xxx . while rhil-23-induced  xxxg1166xxx  secretion in mitogenactivated pbmcs, rhil-12 antagonized this eﬀect. we have
shown here that  xxxd3480xxx  signiﬁcantly decreased il-23induced  xxxg1166xxx  secretion. while  xxxd3038xxx  and  xxxg1166xxx  play a
critical role in autoimmune inﬂammation, il-12 appears
to suppress inﬂammatory response by inhibiting secretion
of  xxxg1166xxx  from activated cells.

m. reddy et al. / cellular immunology 247 (2007) 1–11

il-10 is a th2 cytokine that can downregulate th1
immune responses by inhibiting the ifn-c production by
t and nk cells via suppression of il-12 synthesis in accessory cells. il-12 was reported to induce both ifn-c and
il-10 expression in human t cells [47], which was conﬁrmed in our study. we further showed that  xxxd3480xxx 
inhibited il-12-induced il-10 secretion. this is also consistent with in vivo observations in a phase i psoriasis study in
which  xxxd3480xxx  treatment reduced the expression of  xxxg1161xxx  in psoriatic biopsies, possibly due to a reduced il-12p40
eﬀect on other cytokines that provide positive stimulatory
signals for il-10 production [40].
we did not observe rhil-23-induced il-10 secretion
from activated pbmcs, although it has been reported that
puriﬁed, activated, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells do exhibit
increased production of il-10 in the presence of rhil23, but not in the presence of rhil-12 [11]. this
discrepancy could result from the diﬀerences in culture
conditions. in this study, we used pbmcs and not puriﬁed t cell subsets, as pbmc cultures more closely mimic
an in vivo scenario. we have observed an anticipated
decrease in another anti-inﬂammatory cytokine ( xxxg1180xxx ) in
the presence of il-12, which was overcome by cnto
1275. however, the shift towards a th2-type of immune
response observed in this culture system was not observed
systemically in a phase ii clinical study of psoriatic
patients (manuscript in preparation). additional studies
to examine the eﬀects of  xxxd3480xxx  treatment on
in vivo expression of th1 and th2 cytokines in psoriatic
lesions are ongoing.
several recent reports [4,5,24,45,48] suggest that antagonizing  xxxd3038xxx  alone may be a more appropriate strategy
than targeting both il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx . while this may be
true for some autoimmune diseases studied in murine models, clinical eﬃcacy by targeting  xxxd3038xxx  alone remains to be
seen in clinical studies [49]. further, psoriasis is a result of
complex interactions of many cell types (dendritic cells,
keratinocytes, t cells, nk cells, etc.) and multiple cytokines produced by these cells; therefore, targeting the other
main contributors,  xxxd3038xxx  and indirectly  xxxg1166xxx , in addition
to il-12, may help improve clinical eﬃcacy. neutralization
of  xxxd3038xxx  activity via inhibition of  xxxg1166xxx  induction is also
likely to contribute to the therapeutic beneﬁt of cnto
1275. the p40 subunit of il-12/23 has been described as
the ‘‘master switch’’ for psoriasis pathogenesis [50] and
while the individual contributions of il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  in
psoriasis remains to be distinguished further, blocking the
common p40 subunit of il-12/23 via  xxxd3480xxx  showed
appreciable clinical eﬃcacy in phase i [27] and phase ii [28]
studies.
in conclusion, although in vitro systems do not accurately model in vivo eﬀects, they do provide insight into
possible in vivo mechanisms. the results presented in this
study suggest that the therapeutic eﬀect of  xxxd3480xxx  in
psoriasis may be partly attributable to the neutralization
of il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx  activity, thereby resulting in decreased
expression of markers associated with skin homing,

activation, and co-stimulation, along with inhibition of
il-12-/ xxxd3038xxx -induced pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.
4. materials and methods
4.1. study design
all procedures related to collection of blood from
healthy volunteers were performed in accordance with the
principles of the declaration of helsinki and followed all
approved human study processes in eﬀect at the time of
the study. written, informed consent was obtained from
all healthy volunteers prior to any study procedures.
4.2. pbmc stimulation assay
pbmcs were isolated from peripheral whole blood collected from healthy volunteers using vacutainer tubes with
k3edta additive (becton–dickinson, franklin lakes,
nj) by density gradient centrifugation using  xxxd3253xxx -paque
plus (pharmacia lkb biotechnology, inc., piscataway,
nj). after washing the buﬀy coat layer twice with hanks
 xxxd2988xxx  (cellgro, herndon, va), pbmcs
were resuspended in tissue culture media (rpmi 1640
media [cellgro] + 10% fetal bovine serum [jrh biosciences, lenexa, ks] + 1% penicillin–streptomycin–glutamine [invitrogen, corp., grand island, ny]) and counted
using guava pca system (guava technologies, hayward,
ca). one milliliter of viable cell suspension was added to a
24-well tissue culture plate in the presence or absence of
various stimulating agents, such as: phytohemaglutinin
(pha) (5 lg/ml) (sigma, st. louis, mo); superantigens
staphylococcus enterotoxin a or b (sea or seb)
(1 ng/ml) (sigma); cd3 antibody (2.5 ng/ml) with anticd28 (5 lg/ml) (bd biosciences, san diego, ca); exogenous rhil-12 or rhil-23 (r&d systems); and  xxxd3480xxx 
(centocor). some test conditions included pre-blocking of
 xxxd3480xxx  (centocor), with its idiotypic neutralizing
antibody (cnto 1438; centocor), or non-nab (cnto
8612; centocor) for 1 h at 37 c prior to adding stimulation agents and cells. triplicate wells were set up for each
condition and cultured in an incubator with 5% co2 at
37 c for 72 h.
4.3. flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers
at the end of the 72-h incubation, supernatants were
collected from each well for cytokine analysis and stored
at 20 c in 200 ll aliquots. subsequently, the cells from
triplicate wells were pooled, washed twice in staining buﬀer
(pbs containing 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) and
0.1% sodium azide), and 5 · 105 cells/well (in 50 ll) were
added to a 96-well polypropylene plate. cells were then
stained for 30 min with a combination of three or four
multi-ﬂuorochrome antibodies (cla fitc and cd3
percp) in combination with anti-il-12rb1 pe or antiil-12rb2 pe or cxcr3 pe or cd25 apc or  xxxg390xxx

apc) (bd biosciences). staining with respective isotypematched control antibodies (bd biosciences) was also
included for each condition to detect nonspeciﬁc background staining. after the antibody staining, cells were
ﬁxed in 2% formaldehyde (polysciences inc., warrington,
pa) and stored at 4 c until acquisition (20,000 events in
the lymphocyte scatter gate) on the facs calibur instrument (beckton dickinson immunocytometry systems
[bdis], san jose, ca). analysis of cla il-12r, cd25,
 xxxg390xxx , and cxcr3 expression was performed on cd3
gated population using bd cellquest pro software.

4.4. cytokine analysis
supernatants collected from the pbmc cultures were
examined for diﬀerent cytokines (ifn-c,  xxxg1166xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx ,
il-10, and  xxxg1180xxx ) using quantikine r&d systems elisa
kits (r&d systems). aliquots from triplicate wells were
pooled and assayed in duplicate as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
4.5. statistical analysis
all statistical testing was performed using the sas system for windows version 8 (sas institute, inc., cary,
nc). for analyzing cla expression, the diﬀerent treatment groups were compared using paired t-tests for
cd3+cla+ with stimulation and inhibition of il-12r
expression by  xxxd3480xxx . to determine the expression
of cd25,  xxxg390xxx  and cxcr3 on t lymphocytes and for
secretion of ifn-c,  xxxg1166xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx , il-10, or  xxxg1180xxx  by
pbmcs, repeated measures of analyses of variance were
used for the comparisons between treatment groups. treatment group comparisons included the following: (1) stimulation (stim.) alone vs. stim. +  xxxd3480xxx ; (2)
stim. +  xxxd3480xxx  vs. stim. + il-12 +  xxxd3480xxx ; (3)
stim. + il-12 +  xxxd3480xxx  vs. stim. + il-12 + cnto
1275 + nab; (4) stim. vs. stim. +  xxxd3038xxx ; (5) stim. +  xxxd3038xxx 
vs. stim. +  xxxd3038xxx  +  xxxd3480xxx ; and (6) stimulation +  xxxd3038xxx  +  xxxd3480xxx  vs. stim. +  xxxd3038xxx  + cnto
1275 + nab. each comparison was made including only
the two treatments being compared. no adjustment for
multiple testing was made. a few donors participated in
more than one experiment; this repeated use of donors is
not accounted for in these analyses. observations less than
the lower limit of detection for a given parameter had a
value of half the lower limit substituted for the analyses.
in this study, data from one experiment representative
of several experiments performed (with a range of 6–20
donors, as indicated in the respective ﬁgure legends) were
shown. this approach was chosen to account for the
inter-donor variability and inter-day variability (usually
observed with pbmc cultures) that could mask the
intended observations. all of the patient data collected
from all experiments were used in the statistical calculations; however, only data from representative experiments
