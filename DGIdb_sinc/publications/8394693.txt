retinoids, especially all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  (ra), have been
shown to inhibit the differentiation of preadipose cells. in the
present study, the expression of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar a,
and y) and retinoid x receptors (rxr a, /8 and y) was
examined by northern blot analysis in rat adipose tissue and
mouse 3t3-ll adipose cells. the adipose tissue and/or 3t3-ll
cells expressed mrnas for a number of nuclear retinoid receptors, including rar a, and y, and rxr a, and y. rar a,
rar y, rxr a and rxr ,b mrnas were abundant in adipose
tissue and 3t3-l1 cells. rxr y mrna was detected in adipose
tissue but not in 3t3-ll cells. treatment of 3t3-l1 cells with
1 usm ra led to a 4-5-fold increase in the rar y mrna level,
but only a trace amount of rar mrna was detected. rar

introduction

entially to ligands, thereby facilitating the pleiotropic effects of
ra.
adipose tissue plays an important role in the storage and
metabolism of lipids [32], and is known to be a target organ for
ra. adipose tissue plays an important role in retinol uptake and
storage and in retinol-binding protein synthesis [33,34]. the
adipogenic differentiation of preadipocyte lines was prevented
and/or interrupted at an early stage by ra [35-37]. it has been
reported that ra can down-regulate the gene for  xxxg434xxx , which
belongs to the serine proteinase family and is suggested to be a
systemic regulator of lipid metabolism and energy balance; its
expression in 3t3-f442a adipocytes is regulated post-transcriptionally through a mechanism involving mrna stability [38].
we have shown that ra decreases the activity of lipoprotein
lipase, the key enzyme implicated in adipocyte lipid storage, in
3t3-l1 adipocytes [39]. the mechanisms by which ra elicits
such cellular responses are unclear at present, but presumably
involve the regulation of the expression of specific genes via
rars/rxrs. riaz-ul-haq and chytil [40] showed that, in rat
adipose tissue, rar a and rar y are expressed strongly and
rar ,/ is expressed weakly. rar a but not rar , was detected
in bfc-l1, preadipocytes and adipocytes [34]. however, the
expression of rars/rxrs in adipose tissue and adipocytes has
not been systematically investigated. in this study, we have
examined the expression of rars/rxrs in adipose tissue and
3t3-l1 cells. moreover, to determine whether or not ra
modulates the expression of its own receptors, we also examined
the effects of ra on the expression of rars/rxrs in 3t3-li
cells.

 xxxd3105xxx  exerts a broad range of effects on many essential life
development, differentiation, reproduction, vision,
immunity and homeostasis) [1-3]. the effects of  xxxd3105xxx  have
been widely assumed to be mediated by  xxxd3417xxx  (ra). in
turn, the effects of ra are believed to be mediated by specific
nuclear receptor proteins { xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar); designated as subtypes a [4,5], [6] and y [7]} which are members of
the steroid and thyroid receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent
transcriptional regulators [8]. distinct nuclear receptors that
participate in retinoid signal transduction in response to 9-cis
ra [9,10], referred to as retinoid x receptor (rxr) a [11], [12]
and y [13,14] subtypes, have also been identified. rxrs also
function to augment rars and other receptors, such as the
 xxxg2412xxx  and the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  [13,15-19].
distinct patterns of tissue distribution and developmental stage
specificity in expression of the rars/rxrs have been demonstrated [7,14,20,21]. in addition, multiple isoforms have been
found for rars ac, and y [22-24]. the expression of the rar
a2 [22] and rar /32 [21,23,25,26] isoforms is controlled by ra,
through an ra-responsive cis-acting element (rare) located in
the 5' upstream region of their genes [27-30]. recently, lehmann
et al. [31] showed that the promoter of rar y2 contains an
rare, which can trans-activate the receptor gene in vitro. the
tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns of
the rars/rxrs or differences in the mechanisms underlying
autoregulation by ra of rar isoforms could indicate distinct
physiological roles for rars/rxrs. these rar/rxr subtypes and isoforms may exert specific functions, perhaps by
regulating the transcription of different genes in specific cells.
moreover, the existence of multiple subtypes and their isoforms
may in part account for the pleiotropic effects of ra. the
various subtypes and isoforms are believed to respond differprocesses (e.g.

mrna expression was rapidly (within 2 h) induced by physiological concentrations of ra in a dose-dependent manner. the
response of rar y mrna expression to ra was reversible;
rapid disappearance of rar y mrna occurred on ra removal.
in addition, the induction of rar y expression did not require
de novo protein synthesis, but was completely abolished by an
inhibitor of rna synthesis. using rar yl and y2 isoformspecific probes, the patterns of rar y1 and y2 mrna expression
in 3t3-l i cells in the presence and absence of ra were examined,.
rar yl mrna was detected in 3t3-li cells but was not
affected by ra treatment; however, rar y2 mrna was
strongly induced by ra.

(gaithersburg, md, u.s.a.), a random primer labelling kit and
oligotex-dt30 were from takara shuzo (kyoto, japan), and
fuji aif x-ray film was from fuji (tokyo, japan). all other
products used for cell culture and biochemical analysis were of
the highest quality commercially available.

cell culture
3t3-l1 cells [41] were obtained from the american type culture
collection (rockville, md, u.s.a.). obl771 cells [42] were
kindly provided by professor gerard ailhaud (c.n.r.s., nice,
france). the cells were routinely cultured in 90 mm plastic
culture dishes in dmem containing 10% fcs and 500 ,g/ml
streptomycin. the cells were maintained at 37 °c under a
humidified 5 % co2 atmosphere. for adipose conversion, confluent cultures were treated with dmem containing 10 % fcs,
0.25 ,um dex, 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx  and 10 ,ug/ml insulin [43]; 2 days
later, the medium was changed to dmem containing 10 % fcs.
ra was dissolved in ethanol and then diluted with dmem
containing 100% fcs to an ethanol concentration of 0.1 0%,
which did not affect the proliferation or differentiation of 3t3-l1
cells. control cells received an equal volume of the vehicle. for
examination of ra-induced rar y mrna regulation, 3t3-li
cells, having reached confluency, were placed in dmem containing 10 % fcs which had been treated with dextran-coated
charcoal to remove endogenous retinoids (charcoal-stripped
fcs) [44]. the cells were maintained in dmem containing 10 %
charcoal-stripped fcs for 1 day, and then treated with ra in
dmem containing 10 % charcoal-stripped fcs. for the use of
protein and rna synthesis inhibitors, 3t3-ll cells were allowed
to become confluent for 1 day and then cultured in dmem
containing 10% charcoal-stripped fcs for 1 day. cells were
exposed to dmem/10 % charcoal-stripped fcs containing
5 ,ug/ml  xxxd1800xxx  or 10 ,ug/ml cycloheximide in the absence
or presence of 1 ,tm ra for 3 h.  xxxd1800xxx  and cycloheximide were dissolved in ethanol and then diluted with dmem
containing 10 % charcoal-stripped fcs to an ethanol concentration of 0.1 %. control cells were exposed to dmem/ 10 %
charcoal-stripped fcs containing 0.1 % ethanol for 3 h. the
concentrations of  xxxd1800xxx  and cycloheximide were as in
[25].

rna analysis
total rna was isolated from cells and rat adipose tissue by
extraction with guanidine isothiocyanate, followed by centrifugation through 5.7 m cscl [45]. the rna was ethanolprecipitated, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in water.
total rna was quantified by measuring the absorbance at
260/280 nm. poly (a)+-containing rna was prepared from
total rna using oligotex-dt30 latex. samples of 4 ,sg of
poly(a)+ rna or 20 ,g of total rna were separated by
electrophoresis in a 1.2 % agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel [45]
and then transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary transfer
in 20 x ssc (1 x ssc: 0.15 m nacl, 0.015 m sodium citrate).
after baking for 1 h at 80 °c in an oven, the membrane was

prehybridized at 42 °c for 6 h in 50% formamide containing
0.65 m nacl, 0.1 m sodium pipes, ph 7.4, 5 mm edta, 0.1 %
each of sds, bsa, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and  xxxd3253xxx , and 100 ,ug
ofcalf thymus dna/ml. hybridization was carried out overnight
under the same conditions in the presence of a random-primerlabelled (about 107 c.p.m./ml) mouse rar/rxr cdna probe
(kindly provided by professor pierre chambon, strasbourg,
france) [4,6,13] or a rat fl-actin cdna probe (y. kamei,
t. kawada, r. kazuki and e. sugimoto, unpublished work) as
a control. after hybridization, the membrane was washed in a
washing buffer (2 x ssc, 0.2% sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 0%
sds) for 2 h at 50 °c with constant agitation, air-dried and then
subjected to autoradiography with fuji aif x-ray film at
-70 'c. each probe was removed from the membrane by
treatment with water at 100 'c for 15 min, followed by hybridization with the next cdna probe. the relative intensities of the
bands on the autoradiogram were integrated with a densitometer.
isoform-specific oligonucleotides complementary to rar yl
and rar y2 with the following sequences were prepared: rar
yl, 5'-aaagagtctctccttattggtggc-3' (24-mer);
rar y2, 5'-gacaaacgattccatgcagtcgta-3' (24mer). these are portions of the 5' region, but include the atg
initiation codon of the cdnas for mouse rar yi and rar y2,
as described [24]. for the use of oligonucleotides, prehybridization was performed at 47 'c for 6 h in 2 x sspe
(1 x sspe = 0.15 m nacl, 10 mm na2hp04, 1 mm edta,
ph 7.4), 0.1 % sds and 100 jag of calf thymus dna/ml.
hybridization was performed under the same conditions in the
presence of a 3'-end-labelled oligonucleotide (about
105 c.p.m./ml). the membranes were washed in 2 x sspe and
0.1 0% sds for 30 min at 47 'c. the transcript sizes of
rars/rxrs were estimated by comparison with 28 s (4.7 kb)
[46] and 18 s (1.8 kb) [47] rrnas.

expression patterns of rars/rxrs in rat adipose tissue and
3t3-l1 adipose cells
to study the expression patterns of the rar/rxr genes, we
performed northern blot analysis using 4 jug samples of poly(a)+
rna extracted from rat adipose tissue and mouse 3t3-li cells.
we also examined the effect of ra on the expression of
rars/rxrs in preadipocytes and adipocytes. 3t3-li cells
were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by treating them
with dex,  xxxd2388xxx  and insulin [43]. 3t3-li cells that had been

allowed to differentiate for 9 days were treated with medium
containing 1 ,um ra and then prepared for rna extraction at
24h after treatment. confluent 3t3-li cells (preadipocytes,
before differentiation into adipocytes) were also treated with
medium containing 11m ra and then prepared for rna
extraction at 24 h after treatment. for northern blot analysis,
full-length cdnas of mouse rars a, fi and y and rxrs a, ,l
and y were used as probes. the spatial distribution patterns were
clearly distinct for the six receptors (figure 1). adipose tissue
(figure 1, lane 5) and 3t3-l1 cells (lanes 1-4) expressed mrnas
for a number of nuclear retinoid receptors, including rars a, f8
and y and rxrs a, /8 and y. the northern blot probed with
rar a revealed two transcripts of approximate size 3.8 kb and
2.8 kb in all samples. the levels of rar a expression in 3t3-li
adipocytes (figure 1, lanes 3 and 4) were higher than in the
preadipocytes (lanes 1 and 2). a faint band (- 3.4 kb) was
detected for rar f6 in ra-treated 3t3-l1 cells. treatment of
3t3-l1 preadipocytes and adipocytes with ra led to a 4-5-fold

up-regulation of  xxxd3417xxx  receptor y2

in detail (see below). rxr a mrna (- 5.6 kb) was abundant in
all samples, and rxr , mrnas (- 3.0 kb and 2.7 kb) were
relatively abundant in all samples. a very faint band (- 2.0 kb)
was detected for rxr y in adipose tissue only, i.e. not in 3t3li cells. our transcript sizes for rars/rxrs in adipose tissue
and 3t3-li cells are similar to data reported previously

[7,14,20,40].

ra-induced regulation of rar

y

mrna

the expression of rar y in adult rodents is highly restricted to
skin, lung [7] and adipose tissue [40]. treatment of 3t3-l1 cells
with ra led to a 4-5-fold increase in the rar y mrna level

of ra

3t3-l1 cells were allowed to reach confluency for 1 day and then cultured in dmem containing
10% charcoal-stripped fcs for 1 day. the cells were then placed in dmem containing 10%
charcoal-stripped fcs plus the indicated concentrations of ra. after 6 h, total rna was isolated
and northern blot analysis was performed (a). the indicated mrnas were detected using
radiolabelled cdna probes for rar y and ,-actin. these data are for one representative
experiment out of three independent ones with nearly identical results. the blots were scanned
by densitometry and the highest level of rar y expression found on each blot was taken as
100% (b). results are means+s.e.m. of triplicate determinations at each dose.

(figure 1, lanes 2 and 4). the up-regulation of the rar y gene
by ra in 3t3-li cells seems especially important in analysis of
the physiological functions of ra in adipose tissue. 3t3-li cells,
having reached confluency, were placed in dmem containing
100% fcs that had been treated with dextran-coated charcoal
(charcoal-stripped fcs) to remove endogenous retinoids [44].
the cells were maintained in the dmem containing 10 %
charcoal-stripped fcs for 1 day, and then treated with various
concentrations of ra in dmem containing 100% charcoalstripped fcs. then, 6 h after the addition of ra, the rar y
mrna level was measured by northern blot analysis. the
induction of rar y mrna expression by ra was dosedependent, showing a maximal increase at 1 ,tm ra in 3t3-l1
cells (figure 2) ( xxxd1891xxx  ,lm ra the rar y mrna content was
not further increased; results not shown). the concentration of
ra required to produce a half-maximal effect (ed50) was approx.
50 nm. as observed with densitometry, the magnitude of the
ra-induced up-regulation was 5-fold at 1 ,um. we repeated the
experiment using obl771 cells [42], another preadipocyte cell
line, and observed a greater (10-fold at 1 ,km ra) ra-induced
stimulation of rar y mrna expression (results not shown).
the time course for the up-regulation of rar y mrna
expression was investigated (figure 3). when 3t3-l1 cells were
treated with ra at 1 ,um, a rapid (within 1 h) increase in rar

of the rar y in response to ra is dependent on de novo protein
synthesis, 3t3-l1 cells were exposed to cycloheximide
(10 jug/ml). control experiments had shown that a 97 % decrease
in [3h]leucine incorporation into protein [48] occurred in cells
treated with cycloheximide (results not shown). as shown in
figure 4, cycloheximide treatment for 3 h did not affect the basal
expression of rar y mrna, i.e. the effects of ra on rar y
mrna induction were unaffected by inhibition of protein
synthesis. these observations clearly demonstrate that the induction of the rar y gene by ra is a primary response,
independent of ongoing protein synthesis. the rna synthesis
inhibitor,  xxxd1800xxx , abolished the ra-induced increases in
the levels of rar y transcripts, whereas the protein synthesis
inhibitor, cycloheximide, did not. these findings suggest that ra
induction of the rar y gene is a direct transcription effect.

patterns of expression of rar
mrna was observed (figure 3). the effect of ra removal,
following exposure of 3t3-ll cells to ra for 24 h, was also
investigated; the results in figure 3 show that 3t3-ll cells
respond to ra in a reversible manner; the rapid disappearance
of rar y mrna occurred within 4 h of the removal of ra.

effects of inhlbitors
to investigate the mechanism underlying activ.ation of the rar
y gene by ra, experiments with 3t3-l1 cells were performed in
the presence and absence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis
(cycloheximide) or rna synthesis ( xxxd1800xxx ). the increase
in the steady-state level of rar y mrna resulting from
treatment with ra could be due to an increase in either the rate
of transcription or the stability of rar y mrna. as shown in
figure 4, no ra-induced increase in rar y mrna occurred
when  xxxd1800xxx  (5 jug/ml) was added to 3t3-li cells. thus
the induction of rar y mrna in 3t3-l1 cells was completely
blocked by  xxxd1800xxx , suggesting that the induction is
transcription-dependent. to determine whether or not induction

isoforms in 3t3-l1 cells

kastner et al. [24] characterized several mouse rar y cdna
isoforms (rar yl-y7). rar y2 and rar yl are considered to
be the predominant rar y forms in tissues and embryos.
though the predominant expression of the rar y subtype has
been demonstrated in adipose tissue [40], and in 3t3-li cells in
this study, rar y isoform expression levels have not yet been
analysed in adipose tissue. thus we compared rar yi and rar
y2 expression in 3t3-li cells. since the probe used in figures
1-4 (full-length cdna of mouse rar yl) hybridizes with both
rar yl and rar y2, we used oligonucleotides specific for
either rar yl or rar y2 in this experiment. the patterns of
rar yi and rar y2 mrna expression were studied by
northern blot analysis using 32p-labelled isoform-specific probes.
two blots were hybridized separately with either the rar yl or
y2 specific probe. we confirmed that the two blots gave identical
autoradiographic patterns after subsequent rehybridization with
the fl-actin cdna probe. figure 5 shows that rar yl mrna
was expressed in both ra-treated and non-treated 3t3-li cells,
and was not affected by ra treatment. on the other hand, ra
treatment strongly increased the amount of rar y2 mrna in
3t3-ll cells.

and rxr , mrnas are abundant in

adipose tissue, 3t3-l1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. because of
nearly equivalent hybridization conditions, comparison of the
exposure time of autoradiography (see the legends to figure 1)
and the intensity of hybridization signals (figure 1) could reflect
the relative abundances of rars/rxrs mrnas in the given
samples. thus rar y and rxr a are the most abundant
subtypes in adipose cells, with rar a and rxr , the next most
abundant. clearly, compared with those of other receptor species,
the rar , and rxr y mrna levels were quite low. if a direct
relationship exists between the levels of a receptor mrna and its
protein, the rar a, rar y, rxr a and rxr , proteins would
predominate in adipose tissue. the expression of rar/rxr
mrnas, and of ,3-actin mrna, appeared to be lower in rat
adipose tissue than in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. adipose tissue consists
of several different types of cells, whereas cultured 3t3-l1 cells
consist mainly of adipocytes, and the different abundances of
mrnas in adipose tissue and 3t3-li cells are probably caused
by this adipose tissue heterogeneity.
it has been shown that rar a and rxr , are expressed in
most tissues [7,14,20], and these receptors have been suggested to
be involved in the regulation of general cellular functions. in
contrast, the expression of rar y in adult rodents is restricted
to skin, lung [7] and adipose tissue [40] only. the up-regulation
of the rar y gene by ra in 3t3-l1 cells seems to be especially
important in analysis of the physiological functions of ra in
adipose tissue. our results are supported by the report that the
intragastric administration of ra to retinol-deficient rats
moderately increased (2-fold) the rar y mrna level in vivo
[49]. rxr a is highly expressed in the liver [11], and has also
been shown to be expressed in the absorptive cells of the small
intestine [50]. the liver is known to be the major organ in the
body involved in  xxxd3105xxx /lipid storage and mobilization [51].

811

from its expression pattern, rxr a is thus suggested to play an
important role in  xxxd3105xxx /lipid metabolism [11,50,52]. this
hypothesis was supported further by the demonstration that the
cellular retinol binding protein ii and apolipoprotein al genes,
both of which are involved in  xxxd3105xxx /lipid metabolism, are
rxr-responsive [50,53]. moreover, we have noted (y. kamei,
t. kawada and e. sugimoto, unpublished work) that there are
possible rxr-responsive elements [52] in the genes coding for
malic enzyme [55], intestinal fatty acid binding protein [56], s14
protein [57] and clara cell 10 kda protein [58] all of which are
involved in lipid metabolism. since adipose tissue is considered
to play an important role in  xxxd3105xxx /lipid metabolism and
storage [32-34], rxr a is likely to be involved in regulating
 xxxd3105xxx /lipid metabolism-related gene expression in adipose
tissue. in addition, it has been reported that rxr forms
heterodimers with rar, the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  and the
 xxxg2412xxx , preferentially increasing their dna binding
and the transcriptional function of the respective response
elements [13,15-19]. these observations suggest a combined and
potentially interactive role for rar a, rar y, rxr a and rxr
,/ in adipose tissue.
ra regulates the expression of the rar y gene in 3t3-l i cells
quite rapidly. an increase in rar y mrna was observed within
1 h, with the maximum being reached within 2 h of ra addition
(figure 3), as reported previously for expression of the rar ,
gene induced by ra in human hepatoma cells [25]. the ed50
value for the action of ra observed in the present study (approx.
50 nm) is consistent with that of 50 nm obtained for radependent activation of transglutaminase expression in hl-60
cells [59]. likewise, the ed50 value for the ra-associated increase
in rar ,3 mrna levels in f9 teratocarcinoma cells is around
50-80 nm [60]. the regulation of the rar y gene by ra is
different in skin, embryocarcinoma cells and 3t3-li cells: the
rar y gene was not ra-inducible in embryocarcinoma cells
[7,24] or in skin [61]. the mechanism of autoregulated amplification of rar y by ra may be an important component of the
ra response in adipose tissue, and our results show for the first
time the rapid regulation of rar y gene expression. 3t3-l1 cells
should be helpful in gaining some insight into the promoter
function of the rar y gene involved in its regulation.
kastner et al. [24] characterized several mouse rar y cdna
isoforms (rar yl to rar y7). rar yl and rar y2 are
considered to be the predominant rar y forms in tissues and
embryos. skin contains almost exclusively rar yl transcripts,
whereas lung, embryo and embryocarcinoma cells contain both
rar yl and rar y2 [24]. although the predominant expression
of the rar y subtype has been demonstrated in adipose tissue
[40], and in 3t3-ll cells in the present study, rar y isoform
expression levels have not previously been analysed in adipose
tissue. we compared the expression of the two major rar y
isoforms, rar yl and rar y2, in 3t3-li cells. as shown in
figure 5, ra treatment greatly increased the amount of rar y2
mrna, while rar yl mrna was not affected. our results
supported the study of lehmann et al. [31], which showed that
the promoter of rar y2, but not that of rar yl, contains an
rare which can trans-activate the reporter gene in vitro, i.e.
ra can trans-activate the rar y2 gene, but not the rar yl
gene, in 3t3-li cells.
as described in the introduction, adipose tissue is a target
organ for ra. ra prevents the differentiation of 3t3-l1 cells
from preadipocytes into adipocytes, and also decreases  xxxg434xxx 
mrna levels and  xxxg1337xxx  activity in 3t3 adipocytes.
as observed in our study, the presence of many rars/rxrs in
3t3-ll preadipocytes, adipocytes and adipose tissue would
indicate that retinoids must play a role in regulating gene

expression in adipose tissue. further studies should clarify the
relationship between induction of rar y2 expression by ra
and the phenomena elicited by ra in 3t3-l1 cells, and provide
an insight into the mechanisms underlying the actions of ra in
adipose tissue. moreover, understanding the roles played by
retinoids and rars/rxrs in regulating gene expression in
adipose tissue and during adipocyte differentiation should prove
to be important for understanding the process of adipogenesis.
