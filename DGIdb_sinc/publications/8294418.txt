on the level of mrna for a-subunit of gi2 ( n = 2, data not

nonspecific degradation of mrna. takentogether,these
findings suggest that h-7 caused a decrease in a-ar mrna
level by inhibiting transcription, ratherthan by a decrease in
mrna stability.
inhibition of calcium pathways-to determine the role of
calcium mobilizing pathways in the ne-mediated down-regulation of war mrna, two types of experiments were performed. first, to evaluate the role of intracellular calcium

mobilization, ryanodine wasused to block ne-stimulated
intracellular calcium mobilization (22), asconfirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy of cells loaded with fura-z/am. in
control cells, ne (10 nm) caused a rapid increase inpeak
cytosolic calcium from 86 f 5 to 208 f 15 nm ( p < 0.05; n =

no effect on basal cytosolic calcium (71 f 15 nm; p = not
significant; n = 6), but abolished the ne-stimulated increase
in cytosolic calcium. although ryanodine pretreatment abolished the effect of ne on cytosolic calcium, it had no effect
on the ne-induced down-regulation of war mrna, which
was of comparable magnitude in control (-73 f lo%,n = 3)

be concluded that this effect is mediated by one or more

vsmc used forthese experiments, we have previously shown
that ne stimulatescalcium mobilization via the a-adrenergic

that in these cells, ne increases inositol phosphate and dag

the basal half-life of a-ar mrna determined in the

by ne. since the down-regulation of a-ar mrna in vsmc presence of  xxxd1800xxx  was approximately 3 h. both ne

and pma caused more rapid decreases in mrna level than
did  xxxd1800xxx , indicating that these agents act, at least
in part, by destabilizing a-ar mrna. in contrast, the pkc
inhibitor h-7 caused a decrease in a-ar mrna level at 4 h
that was comparable in magnitude to that caused by actinomycind, andthe effect of the combination of h-7and
 xxxd1800xxx  was comparable to that caused by each agent
alone. this observation suggests that h-7 causes a decrease
in basal a-ar mrna level by inhibiting transcription. of
note, hu et al. (28) found that in ddt, mf-2 cells derived
from the hamster vas deferens, pma caused an increase in aar transcription rate. thus, nemay cause opposing changes
in a-ar mrnalevelvia its effects ontranscriptionand
mrna stability. however, the data presented here indicate
that regardless of a potential effect of pkc to increase transcription of the a-ar gene, in rabbit vsmc this action is
overshadowed by a pkc-mediated decrease in a-ar mrna
stability.
the data we have presented here maybe integrated as
depicted in fig. 8. stimulation of the a-ar by ne results in
activation of phospholipase c and increased production of
dag. other agonists for phospholipase c-coupled receptors,
such as bradykinin, may also increase dag. activation of
pk-c by phorbol esters, or possibly by a hormone-stimulated
increase in dag, results in the phosphorylation of one or
more substrate that decrease ar mrna stability and may
increase basal gene transcription. in rabbit vsmc, the predominant effect of neand phorbol esters is to decrease
mrna stability. this pkc-mediated down-regulation of aar mrna is terminated by a phosphatase sensitive to okadaic acid.
it is of interest that our findings in rabbit vsmc differ
strikingly from observations in ddt, mf-2 cells. in contrast

to thepresent findings in rabbit vsmc, in ddtl mf-2 cells
morris et ul. (32) found that phorbol esters had no effect on
a-ar mrna level, and hu et al. (28) found that phorbol
esters caused atransient increase ina-ar mrnalevel.
similarly, pkc activation caused a marked down-regulation
of a-ar receptor number in rabbit vsmc (20), but had no
effect (29, 30) or caused a transient increase (28) in a-ar
number in ddt, mf-2 cells, whichappear to require hormone
binding for the process of agonist-mediated receptor downregulation to occur (30). it will, therefore, be of interest to
elucidate differences at both the receptor and mrna levels
that may determine agonist dependency of a-ar down-regulation and the influence of pk-c on a-ar mrna stability.
