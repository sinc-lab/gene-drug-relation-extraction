(accepted november 4, 1992)

energy-using non-mitochondrial atpases were assayed in rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes and
synaptosomal subfractions, namely synaptosomal piasma membranes and synaptic vesicles. the
following enzyme activities were evaluated: na § k § -atpase; high- and low-affinity ca2§ atpase; basal mg2*-atpase; ca2+, mg2+-atpase. the evaluations were performed after four
week-treatment with saline [controls] or a-adrenergic agents (g-yohimbine, clonidine), energymetabolism interfering compound (theniloxazine), and oxygen-partial pressure increasing agent
(almit~ne), in order to define the plasticity and the selective changes in individual atpases. in
rat cerebral cortex, the enzyme adaptation to four-week-treatment with g-yohimbine or clonidine
was characterized by increase in both high- and low-affinity ca2+ -atpase activities. the action
involves the enzyme form located in the synaptic plasma membranes. the enzyme adaptation to
the subchronic treatments with theniloxazine or  xxxd118xxx  was characterized by increase in na +,
k+-atpase or mgz+-atpase activities, respectively. the action involves the enzymatic forms
located in the synaptic plasma membranes. thus, the pharmacodynamic effects of the agents tested
should also be related to the changes induced in the activity of some specific synaptosomal nonmitochondrial atpases.

introduction

the na + gradients. the na+/kt-pump maintains low
intracellular na t concentration because this cation is
ejected against its concentration gradient (1-6). thus,
na t , kt-atpase is responsible for the maintenance of
na t and k t gradients and is involved in the determination of the resting membrane potential required for the
electrical activity in the cns (7).
moreover, na +, kt-atpase is involved in the presynaptic transmitter release (8-10), in postsynaptic activities (11, 12), and in transmitter uptake (13), suggesting
an important role in the turnover of neurotransmitters in
the nerve endings (14). there is possible an indirect
influence of the enzyme via the ion gradients because,
even if the nat/kt-pump is inhibited but the ion gradients remain constant, transmitter reiease and uptake is
not affected.
ca2+-atpase and ca 2§ mget-atpase activities

the cerebral energy transduction is determined by
mitochondrial proton-pumping ht-atpase [atp-synthetase], while the synaptosomal non-mitochondrial
atpases play a pivotal role in the regulation of presynaptic nerve ending homeostasis.
na +, kt-atpase, an enzyme located in the synaptic plasma membranes, functions as an electrogenic
ion pump because, for each hydrolyzed atp, three
na § ions are extruded and two k t ions are accumulated into the cell. because of the lower na t conductance across the plasmatic membranes in respect to
the k + one, the na+/k+-pump primarily modulates

located in synaptic plasma membranes pump ca2+ ions
either into synaptic structures or out of the nerve endings
to help in maintaining synaptoplasmic caz+ homeostasis. the intracellular concentration of ca2+ could be involved in the interaction between atp and atpase to
promote both the attachment of secretory granules to
plasmalemma and the extrusion of their neurotransmitter
content to the nerve terminal exterior by exocytosis (1523). the lineweaver-burk plots of the velocity-activator
curves for caz+-atpase indicate that in the preparations
of synaptic vescicles the enzyme has two binding sites
of different affinities for the ca2+: the higher affinity
caz+-atpase binding site has an apparent km of 0.06
tam caz+ and the lower one an apparent km of 7.5
ca2+ (22).
synaptosomes from mammalian brain tissues have
an atp-hydrolyzing mgz+-atpase activity located in
the synaptic vescicles generating an electrochemical proton gradient which modulates the uptake of neurotransmitters. the enzyme located in the synaptosomal plasma
membranes has externally oriented active sites and,
therefore, can be classified as an ecto-enzyme. the mgz+atpase activity located in the synaptic plasma membrane is involved in the hydrolysis of atp to adenosine
(24-28).
with few exceptions (29-31), the alterations in nerve
ending atpases have been extensively studied in vitro
by acute treatment (32-50), with little or no attention to
the adaptation to subchronic or chronic in vivo administration. the aim of this study is to evaluate in rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes and synaptosomal subfractions
[namely, synaptosomal plasma membranes and synaptic
vesicles] the changes in non-mitochondrial atpases with
the four-week-administration of drugs having vastly different mechanisms of action, namely e~-adrenergic agents
(g-yohimbine and clonidine), energy-metabolism interfering compound (theniloxazine) and poz-increasing drug
( xxxd118xxx ).
in fact, the major factors involved in brain alteration are represented by neurotransmission, energy metabolism and oxygen availability. only for the adrenergic
agents the mechanism of action is well defined. by this
experimental design it is possible, however, to evaluate
the effects of exogenous factors on the plasticity of the
enzyme proteins and/or the relationships among the individual atpases.

experimental procedure
animals and experimentalplan. the evaluations were carried out
on male albino wistar rats aged 3 months. the animals were kept

benzi, gorini, ghigini, arnaboldi, and villa
under constant environmental conditions (temperature: 22 • 1~ relative humidity: 60 +- 5%; circadian rhythm: 12-hr light and 12-hr
dark) and fed normal laboratory diet as pellets. five groups of five/
seven rats were analyzed after the intraperitoneal treatment for 4 weeks
(7 days/week) with: (a) saline; (b)  xxxd118xxx  or (dialtylamino-4',6'triazinyl-2')-l-(bis-parafluorobenzhydryl)-4-piperazine = 1.5 mg/kg;
(c) g-yohimbine or raubasine or tetrahydroserpentine = 0.5 mg/kg;
(d) clonidine or 2,6-dichloro-n-2-imidazolinylidenbenzamine = 0:0002
mg/kg; (e) theniloxazine or (+)2-[o-(2-thenyi)phenoxy] methyl morpholine = 10 mg/kg. the treatments were performed between 9:00
and 10:30 a.m. the doses were within the range used experimentally
to characterize the pharmacodynamic action of the agents tested. the
allocation of the rats to the groups was made randomly.
cerebral tissue drawing and biochemical evaluation. at the
scheduled time, the rats were killed by decapitation between 9:00 and
10:30 [24 h after the last administration]. the brain of each animal
was quickly removed (15 s) and immersed in a cold isolation medium
[0.32 m sucrose; 1.0 mm edta-k+; 10 mm tris-hc1 (ph %4)]. the
dissection of the cerebral cortex was performed in a precooled box
(0~176 and the tissue was quickly immersed in the isolation medium.
the fraction and subfractions tested were: (i) synaptosomes; (ii) synaptosomal plasma membranes; (iii) synaptic vesicles. the activity of
the following enzymes was assayed: (a) na +, k*-atpase; (b) highand low-affinity ca2§
(c) basal mgz+-atpase; (d) ca 2+, mg 2+atpase. the enzyme activities were expressed as ~zmoles of p~ released / hour / mg of protein.

preparation of synaptosomes and synaptosomal subfractions.
cerebral cortex homogenate was prepared (51-53) in the isolation medium by a teflon-glass potter-elvehjem homogenizer (electronic control of the revolution speed) with a loosely fitted teflon pestle (total
clearance = 0.1 ram) rotating at 800 rpm for 1 min (five up-and-down
passes of the pestle). the homogenate (7 - 10 %) was centrifuged at
1,000 x g for 5 min to remove the nuclear subfractiom the pellet was
resuspended in isolation medium and again centrifuged as above, this
step being repeated once again.
the three supernatants were then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20
rain to obtain the crude mitochondrial subfraction (p2). the subfraction
was resuspended in isolation medium and layered over a density gradient of 7.5% and 12%  xxxd3253xxx  (wt/vol) in suspension medium [0.32m
sucrose; 50 ~ edta-k+; 10 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.4)]
the suspension was centrifuged at 70,000 x g for 20 rain. myelin
subfraction was suckled off and synaptosomes were then collected
from the interface of the ficoi1 layers, diluted with isolation medium,
and spun down by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 25 rain. the pellet
was then suspended in 0.32 m sucrose solution (ph 7.4) and an aliquot
was used within 2 hours.
an aliquot of the synaptosomal fraction was lysed in 6 mm trishct (ph 8.1) for 1 h at 0-4"c and layered over a discontinuous sucrosehepes gradient (0.32; 0.64; 0.80; 1.0 m). the suspension was centrifuged at 60,000 g for 2 h and separated bands were collected with
a glass capillary pipette. the subfraction of synaptic vesicles was the
interface between 0.32 m and 0.64 m sucrose-hepes gradients. the
subfraction was centrifuged at 110,000 x g for 30 min. the pellet
was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose solution (ph 7.4) and it was used
for evaluation of enzyme activities and protein related to the synaptic
vesicles. the synaptosomat-plasma membrane subfractions spmi and
spmz were collected, respectively, between 0.64 m and 0.80 m and
between 0.80 m and 1.0 m sucrose-hepes gradients. the subfractions were centrifuged at 110,000 g for 30 rain. the pellets were
resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose solution (ph 7.4) and they were used
for enzyme and protein assays related to synaptic plasma membranes.

different ions and the enzymes. the enzyme activities were expressed
as p,moles of pj released/hour/rag of protein of the subfraction tested
(22, 24, 30, 42, 54).
na§ k§
activity was calculated from the difference between the na+, k +, mga+-atpase activity and direct mga+-atpase
activity.
na+, k +, mga+-atpase activity was evaluated in 1.0 ml of a
medium containing: 50 mm imidazole-hc1buffer ph 7.4; 120 mm
 xxxg2020xxx ; 10 mm kc1; 5 mm mgci2; 4 mm atp. vanadium free na2atp solution was made fresh prior to use by neutralizing atp to ph
7.4 with tris. at the end of the incubation period [10-15 min; 37~
with the sample of the subfraction tested [24-48 txg of protein], the
reaction was stopped by cooling to 4~ and adding 0.5 ml of 10%
(wt/vol) of tca solution.
mg2+-atpase activity was evaluated in 1.0 ml of a medium containing: 50 mm imidazole-hcl buffer ph 7.4; 5 mm mgc12; 4 mm
atp. atp was neutralized and the reaction was stopped as previously
described.
ca2+, mgz+-atpaseactivity was evaluated in 1.0 ml of a medium
containing: 50 mm imidazole-hc1buffer ph 7.5; 100mm kci; 2 mm
mgc12; 120 p~m caci2; 100 ixm egta; 100 ~xm freshly prepared
ouabain; t0 p~g of freshly prepared oligomycin in  xxxd102xxx ;
1.23 mm atp. atp was neutralized and the reaction was stopped as
previously described.
low and high affinity ca2§
activities were evaluated in
1.0 ml of a medium containng: 50 mm imidazote-hcl buffer ph 7.5;
200 p~m sucrose; 200 ~m cac12 for the high-affinity form of 2 mm
for the low-affinity form; 100 ixm egta; 1.84 mm atp. atp was
neutralized and the reaction was stopped as previously described. the
ca2+aatpase activity was calculated by the difference between the
activity in the presence and absence of ca2+.
for all the enzyme activities tested, after centrifugation of the
tca-sample, 1.0 ml of the clear supernatant was assayed for p~ (55)
by adding and mixing [5 min]: (a) 3.0 ml of a solution containing both
4.6% of sodium acetate trihydrate [ch3coona.3h20] and 0.25% of
copper sulfate pentahydrate [cuso4.sh20 ] in 2n acetic acid
[ch3cooh]; (b) 0.5 ml of 5% ammonium molybdate
[(nh4)6moto2,'4h2ol.
subsequently, 0.5 ml of 2% maps [hoc6h4nhch3)2.hzso4]
in 5% sodium sulfite [na2so3] was added and mixed. after 10 min
the absorbance was read at 870 nm versus blank sample containing
the subfraction tested and all the reagents without cations. a titration
curve for p~was made with anhydrous kh2po4.
the protein content was determinedusing crystallinebovine serum
albumin as a standard (56).

results
the values of the enzyme activities m a r k e & j differ
according to the individual atpases tested. in fact, in
the synaptosomal subfraction the values are: na +, k +atpase = 13.50 __ 0.50; ca2+-atpase = 8.12 _+

according to the synaptosomal localization. for example, the ca2+-atpase values are: in synaptosomes =

discussion
several energy-using non-mitochondrial atpases
were tested in rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes and synaptosomal subfractions, namely synaptosomal plasma
membranes and synaptic vesicles. the values of the enzyme activities markedly differ according to both the
individual atpases and the synaptosomal localization.
the roles of the individual atpases are determined
by their subcellular localization (29,57-59). for example, in synaptic plasma membranes the ecto-mg~+-atpase catalyses the hydrolysis of the atp to adenosine.
in contrast, in synaptic vesicles mgz+-atpase modulates the uptake and release of different neurotransmitter,
according to the different nerve terminals involved.
the synaptosomal non-mitochondrial atpases are,

thus, modulated by atp concentration, substrate affinity
and synaptic subcellular localization. the possibility that
atpases might have specific forms with distinct cell
distributions has not been evaluated in the present research. really, none of the known isoforms of na +, k +atpase (60-61) is unique to neural or glial cells, and
membrane subfractions are known to contain mixture of
the isoforms. effects limited to different cell subfractions should be related aiso to different actions of the
drugs on the environments from which those subfractions are derived rather than only from differences in
enzyme forms. in any case, this research shows that the
adaptation to chronic exposure to pharmacological agents
induces specific modifications in individual atpases,
according to their synaptic localization.
clonidine decreases norepinephrine release from
adrenergic c~2-receptors linked to neurons activating the
peripheral n.s., and stimulates c~2-receptors of neurons
inhibiting the peripheral n.s. activation. the ~-yohimbine action is preferentially postsynaptic. in fact, clonidine affinity is greater for the  xxxd1301xxx  receptors, while a-

yohimbine affinity is greater for the (~1- than for the c~2adrenergic receptors (62-64). the involvement of the oladrenergic receptors may support the electrocorticorgram (ecog) modifications by the drug treatment (65).
in fact, ~-yohimbine induces in rat an increase in power
in the 1 to 6 hz band during the first hour, this effect
attenuating over subsequent periods. from 9 to 30 hz
band the drug induces a slight increase in power, reaching major changes  xxxd1891xxx  and 19 hz (66). clonidine induces a quite similar effect, activating the power spectra
practically from 5 to 30 hz (67).
it is a leap of faith to unequivocally relate these
ecog modifications only to the moderate atpase-linked
changes on both the neural concentration of ions and
their transmembrane gradients. however, the drug-induced ecog modifications should be related also to the
adaption to the four-week-administration of clonidine and
g-yohimbine. in fact, both drugs increase the synaptosomal low- and high-affinity ca2+-atpase activities, the
effect being supported by the enzyme form located in
the synaptic plasma membranes. the mg 2+ independent

723
ca 2+ stimulated [non-mitochondrial] atpase plays an
important role in the regulation of the intracellular ca 2§
(68), thus working together many other mechanisms (e.g.,
the second messengers) to modulate the polarization/depolarization state of the presynaptic nerve ending membrane. the interference of both 8-yohimbine and clonidine
with the high-affinity ca2+-atpase suggests that their
effects are present also at ca 2+ concentration comparable with the intracellular level of the ion [10 .7 m].
theniloxazine antagonizes in rat the co2, electroconvulsive shock-, and scopolamine-induced amnesia (69),
shortening the time of kcn-induced coma and prolonging the survival time in hypobaric hypoxia-loaded mice
(70). the drug ameliorates the kcn-induced energetic
alterations reducing the changes in rat brain phosphocreatine, glucose and lactate concentrations, and keeping
atp, amp and ecp at nearly their normal values (71).
theniloxazine inhibits in vitro the norepinephrine uptake
to mouse cerebral synaptosomes and in vivo the norepinephrine uptake but not dopamine or serotonin uptake
(72). the drug improves the abnormal ecog of alcuronium-immobilized rats reducing the increased the 1 to
7 hz band power (73), and in human subjects increases
to 7.5 to 12.5 hz band, decreasing the 13 to 30 hz band
mainly in the frontal leads (74). these effects also should
be related to the adaptation to the four-week-administration of theniloxazine inducing an increase in the synaptosomal na +, k+-atpase activity. the effect involves
the enzyme form located in the synaptic plasma membranes where it catalyses the atp hydrolysis and uses
the energy set free to pump k + inward and na + outward. the na +, k+-atpase modification by theniloxazine could interfere with the na § transmembrane
gradient, the intracellular k § concentration and, possibly, with the related electrical events.
 xxxd118xxx  alters the chemoreceptor activity increasing both the oxygen partial pressure and the discharge
frequency from afferent respiratory neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus
rectoambigualis (75-78). with the exception of 3 hz
band,  xxxd118xxx  induces an increase in rat ecog power
over the entire spectrum, reaching major changes at 11
to 22 hz (66). these effects should be also related to
the adaptation to the  xxxd118xxx  subchronic administration
increasing the mg2+-atpase activity, the effect being
supported by the enzyme form located in the synaptosomal plasma membranes. in this structures the mg 2+atpase has externally oriented active sites and it is
classified as an ecto-enzyme that carries out the atp
hydrolysis to adenosine generation (24-26, 79).
both adenosine and adenosine-receptors are present
in the cortical deeper layers, especially in the pyramidal

724
cells in layer v (80-82). there is similar distribution of
both adenosine al-receptors and n m d a binding sites
(83). by the interference with mgz+-atpase the  xxxd118xxx  action should be related to adenosine release. in
general, this event results in neuronal hyperpolarization,
block of nmda-receptors, inhibition of both ca 2+ and
na + uptake, reduction of excitatory amino acid release,
acting in a combined fashion. pathological alterations
support the release of excitatory amino acids acting at
kainate- xxxd3068xxx -, and nmda-receptors, and leading
to both ca2§
and cell bursting that stimulates the
reactive adenosine formation and release (84-87).
in synaptosomal plasma membranes from cerebral
cortex, the adaptation to  xxxd118xxx  four week-treatment
results in the modification of mg2+-atpase activity, but
is ineffective on the na +, k+-atpase. in contrast, the
adaptation to the theniloxanine subchronic treatment results in the modification of the na +, k+-atpase activity, but is ineffective on the mgz+-atpase. the effects
of other drugs acutely tested in vitro on the na +, k §
atpase activity were generally paralleled by the effects
on the mg2+-atpase activity (42). this close relationship in vitro between the two enzymes was justified by
their very close structural association (88). this result
does not support this view in vivo. the comparison of
the different kinds of pharmacological responses induced
by either acute in vitro treatment of subchronic in vivo
administration suggests that in the last case the factor
involved is the delayed enzyme adaptation to the drug
[or its metabolites] rather than the single combination of
the drug with the enzyme to form the drug-enzyme complex.
at present the pharmacological interests are particularly devoted to the mitochondrial proton-pumping h +atpase linked to the energy transduction, with little or
no attention to the energy-using synaptosomal non-mitochondrial atpases. these enzymes, however, play very
important roles in ion-transporting activity, metabolicstep regulation, neurotransmitter turnover, etc. the
adaption of subchronic exposure to exogenous agents
modifies the specific activity of different synaptosomal
non-mitochondrial atpases. of course, it is a leap of
faith to unequivocally relate the 20-30% increase in atpase activities to a unique promotion of important changes
on the neural levels of ions and their transmembrane
gradients. there is, however, logical reason for the hypothesis that also the atpase modifications by the adaptation to chronic drug administration are working to
support some important pharmacodynamic responses of
the nerve endings.
