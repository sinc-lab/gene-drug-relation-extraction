 xxxg99xxx  mediates its haemodynamic effects by binding to specific cell-surface receptors. in
humans, two receptor subtypes have been identified, designated at1 and at 2 . because all major
deleterious effects of  xxxg99xxx  are produced via binding to at1 -receptors, selective blockade of this
receptor subtype should confer haemodynamic benefits, while allowing stimulation of the potentially
beneficial effects mediated by  xxxg101xxx  -receptors. experimental studies using various models have
consistently revealed marked differences in the receptor binding properties of different at 1 -receptor
blockers. the relative receptor binding affinities of currently available at1 -receptor blockers is
candesartan > irbesartan >  xxxd3487xxx /exp-3174/ xxxd3303xxx  >  xxxd3295xxx  > losartan > eprosartan. candesartan is also released from the receptor more slowly than other available at 1 -receptor blockers,
with a half-life of approximately 152 min for the receptor-blocker complex, compared with 31 min for
exp-3174, 17 min for irbesartan and 5 min for losartan. candesartan therefore binds to the at1 -receptor
more tightly and more persistently than other at 1 -receptor blockers. key words: at1 -receptor,  xxxg101xxx  receptor,  xxxg99xxx , candesartan, receptor pharmacology.

introduction

ó

the haemodynamic and cardiovascular effects of  xxxg99xxx  are all mediated by its binding to receptors on the
surfaces of target cells within central and peripheral blood
vessels, and within the heart and other organs. the
development of highly selective and speci c antagonists
has allowed the identi cation of a number of angiotensin
ii receptor subtypes, of which two have been identi ed in
humans. angiotensin type 1 (at 1 )-receptors are thought
to mediate all major deleterious effects of  xxxg99xxx ,
including vasoconstriction, cell growth and cardiac and
vascular remodelling, whereas angiotensin type 2 ( xxxg101xxx  )receptors appear to have vasodilator and anti-growth
effects, thus counteracting the effects of the at 1 -receptor.
the angiotensin type 1 (at1 )-receptor blockers are
increasingly being recognized as an important advance in
the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
several at1 -receptorblockers are now available,including
candesartan, losartan,  xxxd3487xxx , irbesartan, eprosartan and
 xxxd3303xxx . although the structures of these compounds
share common features, some differences may confer
distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. the at 1 -receptor blockers have an advantage
over ace inhibitorsin that, by selectivelyblockingonly the
actions of  xxxg99xxx  at at 1 -receptors, they allow
hyperstimulation of the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor subtype. these
agents thereby not only prevent the deleterious haemodynamic effects of angiotensinii, but might also potentiateits
bene cial cardiovascular actions. in contrast, ace inhibitors decrease the production of  xxxg99xxx  and thus
reduce stimulation of both at 1 - and at 2 -receptors.

this article summarizes the key pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic characteristics of the main at 1 receptor blockers, emphasizing the particular features of
candesartan that distinguish it from other members of the
class.
absorption, bioavailability and
elimination of at1 -receptor blockers
candesartan
candesartan is a biphenyltetrazole derivative of the
prototype at1 -receptor blocker, losartan. candesartan
cilexetil is an ester prodrug with very little intrinsic
receptor blocking activity. it is, however, hydrolysed
rapidly and completely to the highly active compound,
candesartan, during absorption across the gastrointestinal
tract [1, 2]. the bioavailability of candesartan after
administration of an oral solution of  xxxd417xxx 
is approximately 42% [3], with no evidence of an effect of
food intake on bioavailability. candesartan has a terminal
plasma half-life of 8–11 h [4] and is eliminated mainly
unchanged via the kidneys and the liver, although a small
proportion is eliminated after hepatic metabolism to an
inactive product.
because activation of  xxxd417xxx  to candesartan is not dependent on hepatic metabolism, plasma
concentrations of candesartan show little inter- and intraindividual variability and are proportional to candesartan
cilexetil dose over the entire therapeutic range [4]. these
features result in consistent and predictable plasma
candesartan concentrations after oral dosing.

losartan
the oral bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33%
[5, 6] and, unlike  xxxd417xxx , losartan itself has
some at1 -receptor blocking activity [5, 7]. some 14% of
an oral dose of losartan is converted via  rst pass hepatic
oxidation to exp-3174 [6, 8], a metabolite with signi cantly greater at 1 -receptor blocking capacity than the
parent compound [5, 9]. levels of exp-3174 are more
variable than those of candesartan, as they depend both on
the bioavailability of losartan as well as on p-450 status,
which can vary markedly both between and within
individuals [10]. losartan has a plasma half-life of 2 h
and any that is not converted to exp-3174 (plasma halflife: 6–9 h) is either inactivated or excreted unchanged via
the kidneys [5, 6].
 xxxd3487xxx 
 xxxd3487xxx  is a biphenyltetrazole-valine derivative of
losartan. oral bioavailability is 25%, which is reduced
by some 46% by concomitant food intake [11].  xxxd3487xxx 
has a plasma half-life of approximately 9 h [12, 13], and
no metabolites of  xxxd3487xxx  have been identi ed. thirteen
per cent of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the
urine, with the remaining 87% excreted in faeces.
irbesartan
irbesartan is an imidazole derivative of losartan [14]. oral
bioavailability is 60–80% [15]. irbesartan has a plasma
half-life of 11–15 h and is extensively metabolized by the
hepatic p-450 system to inactive products. approximately
20% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine, with the
remainder excreted in the faeces.
eprosartan
eprosartan is an imidazole-5-acrylic acid derivative of
losartan, with a bioavailability of 13%, which is reduced
by concomitant food intake. after oral dosing, eprosartan
has a plasma half-life of 4.5–9 h. no active metabolite of
eprosartan has been identi ed and, after oral dosing, 90%
is excreted in the faeces and some 7% in the urine.
 xxxd3303xxx 
 xxxd3303xxx  is a biphenyl-carboxylic acid-benzimidazole
derivative of losartan. oral bioavailability is 40–60%. in
man, the average terminal plasma half-life of  xxxd3303xxx 
is generally between 20 and 24 hours. the compound is
metabolized exclusively by conjugation with glucuronic
acid. the pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide is
stable and rapidly cleared by biliary excretion [16, 17].

binding characteristics of at1 -receptor
blockers
because the effects of  xxxg99xxx  on blood pressure,
cardiac and blood vessel remodelling, and  uid and
electrolyte retention, are all mediated by its binding to
at1 -receptors, differences in strength and duration of the
binding of various blocking agents to at1 -receptors are
likely to underpin differences in their antihypertensive
ef cacies. agents with tight, long-lasting receptor binding might thus be expected to have a greater, more
persistent antihypertensive effect than those that are more
readily displaced by  xxxg99xxx .
studies using blood vessels isolated from experimental
animals have shown distinct differences in the  xxxg100xxx  binding kinetics of losartan, exp-3174 and
candesartan. losartan inhibits the binding of angiotensin
ii to at 1 -receptors, as indicated by a reduction in
 xxxg99xxx -mediated vessel contraction, without reducing the maximal contractile response to  xxxg99xxx .
the binding of losartan to the at1 -receptor can therefore
be overcome by increasing the concentration of  xxxg99xxx , while the concentration–response curve for
exp-3174 indicates that the this compound is somewhat
less easily displaced from the at1 -receptor by  xxxg99xxx  [18].
candesartan, in contrast, reduces the maximal contractile response of isolated vessels to  xxxg99xxx , and
higher candesartan doses completely prevent the contractile response, irrespective of the dose of  xxxg99xxx 
used. this suggests that the binding of candesartan to
at1 -receptors is much tighter than that of losartan or
exp-3174, and that the release of candesartan from the
receptor is relatively slow [19, 20]. indeed, reports have
suggested that the af nity of candesartan for the  xxxg100xxx  is 10 times that of exp-3174 and some 50 times
that of losartan, the relative receptor af nities of currently
available at1 -receptor blockers being candesartan >
irbesartan >  xxxd3487xxx /exp-3174/ xxxd3303xxx  >  xxxd3295xxx 
> losartan > eprosartan [21].
the tight binding of candesartan to the at1 -receptor
has also been shown in studies of chinese hamster ovary
cells expressing the human form of the at1 -receptor
(cho-at 1 cells). for example, in one study these cells
were pre-incubated for 30 min with various concentrations of candesartan, losartan, exp-3174 or irbesartan,
before exposure to  xxxg99xxx .  xxxg99xxx 
antagonism was then assessed by measuring the inhibition, by each at 1 -receptor blocker, of angiotensin iimediated intracellular accumulation of inositol phosphate
(ip) [22].
this investigation showed that candesartan and exp3174 reduced maximal ip accumulation (fig. 1). the
maximal response of the cells to angiotensinii was reduced

l. in contrast,pre-incubationwith exp-3174, 0.5–5 nmol/l,
partially reduced maximal ip accumulation, with a rightward shift in the dose–response curve. irbesartan, 10–
100 nmol/l, also partially reduced the maximal response
and shifted the dose–response curve to the right, whereas
losartan, 100–1000 nmol/l, shifted the curve rightwards
without altering the maximal ip response, indicating
relatively loose binding to at1 -receptors.

duration of receptor binding
washout studies in vitro using blood vessels isolated from
rats have shown that the antagonistic effect of candesartan
towards  xxxg99xxx -mediated contraction is longer
lasting than that of losartan (fig. 2) [18]. another washout
study [23] con rmed not only the tight binding of
candesartan to human at1 -receptors, but also that the
binding of candesartan to these receptors is long-lasting
by showing that [3 h]candesartan was not readily
displaced from cho-at1 cells by their subsequent

exposure to losartan. the duration of candesartan binding
to the human at 1 -receptor was also indicated by the
observation that the inhibition of  xxxg99xxx -mediated
ip accumulation by this agent was more persistent than
inhibition by losartan, exp-3174 or irbesartan (fig. 3).
the derived half-lives for binding to human at 1 receptors are shown in table i.
the results of washout studies like these show that
at 1 -receptor blockade persists, even after the removal of
the at 1 -receptor blocker from the receptor environment.
receptor binding half-lives are therefore likely to be as
important and, in some cases, more important than plasma
half-lives in determining the duration of  xxxg99xxx 
antagonism.
why is the binding of candesartan
stronger than that of other at 1 receptor blockers? an hypothesis
the presence of a two-phase inhibition of  xxxg99xxx 
response by at 1 -receptor blockers [24], indicating both a
loose and a tight binding form of the at1 -receptorblood pressure 2001

blocker complex, might help to explain the relatively long
duration of receptor binding by candesartan. the proportion of the tight, compared with the loose binding form of
the complex was shown to be consistently greater for
candesartan than for any of the other agents studied
(table ii).
conclusions
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations
have shown that the binding of candesartan to the  xxxg100xxx  is tighter and of longer duration than that of any
other at 1 -receptor blocker currently available. although
a direct link between these distinctive binding characteristics of candesartan and its clinical ef cacy has not
been established, the tight, persistent binding of candesartan to the at1 -receptor is consistent with its longlasting antihypertensive effect.
discussion

relevant where agonists and antagonists are incubated
together, rather than the antagonist being added before
the  xxxg99xxx ?
thomas unger: in either case this is a classical
pharmacological experiment, as long as the methodology is described accurately, the data are interpreted
correctly, and people understand the pharmacological
de nitions of terms such as “insurmountable”.
lennart hansson: i guess that if a patient takes the
medication when levels of  xxxg99xxx  are high, then
the experimental situation of adding agonist and
antagonist together would be physiologically realistic.
in many other real life situations, i assume endogenous
 xxxg99xxx  levels are very low, which would mean
that a long-acting drug would have the opportunity to
occupy the receptor almost without competition from
 xxxg99xxx ?

thomas unger: i follow your argument, in that the renin–
angiotensin system may usually be supressed because
of the high salt intake in the westernized world.
however, we cannot be sure what happens at the
receptor site. the concentration of  xxxg99xxx  at the
receptor may be different from that in the blood due to
the production of  xxxg99xxx  within cardiovascular
tissues.
peter trenkwalder: an experiment of some clinical
relevance would be to infuse  xxxg99xxx  at
physiological concentrations and study the degree of
blockade of its effects by the different agents.
thomas unger: the purpose of such an experiment would
be to produce a standardized steady-state effect of
 xxxg99xxx  at the at1 -receptor, which would require
subjects on a similar salt-containing diet to aim for a
similar activity of the endogenous renin–angiotensin
system. of course, one could still speculate about
possible differences in contributions from angiotensin
ii generated in the tissues.
giuseppe mancia: what are the clinical implications of
surmountable versus insurmountable at1 -receptor
blockade? an obvious one is duration of action, but
do you think that insurmountable blockade can also be
more effective in preventing increased levels of
 xxxg99xxx , as occurs for example during treatment
with at 1 -receptor blockers, from hitting the receptors?

dose of losartan, there will be less antihypertensive
action and there is less binding to the at1 -receptor in in
vivo assays than 24 h following a comparable dose or
candesartan. however, i think the binding differences
also translate into differences in absolute ef cacy.
when you give losartan, you have three compounds
competing for the receptor—namely losartan, exp3174 and  xxxg99xxx . the binding of losartan is and
fast and readily reversible, so that  xxxg99xxx  has
more chances per time unit to activate the at 1 receptor, compared with a drug like candesartan, which
is attached to the at 1 -receptor for much longer.
lennart hansson: would it also be reasonable to assume
that these properties may in uence the degree of organ
protection afforded by at 1 -receptor blockers?
thomas unger: yes, but as you know it is very dif cult to
translate from such theoretical deliberations to organ
protection and clinical outcomes.
