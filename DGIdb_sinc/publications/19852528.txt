summary
abstract

 xxxd2834xxx  is a second-generation serotonin  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist, with a
distinct pharmacological profile that differs from first-generation  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is widely indicated for the prevention of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv) in the acute and delayed
phases following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mec) and the prevention of cinv in the acute phase following highly emetogenic chemotherapy
(hec). in the us, oral  xxxd2834xxx  is approved for the prevention of cinv in
the acute phase following mec (although this formulation is not currently
available), and intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (ponv) in the first 24 hours following surgery. all
indications are currently limited to adult patients.
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to intravenous ondansetron (with
statistically greater efficacy than ondansetron) or  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing cinv
following mec, or to intravenous ondansetron or granisetron in preventing
cinv following hec, in the acute phase. statistically greater efficacy was seen
with intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  than ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing
cinv following mec in the delayed phase. oral  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing cinv in the acute phase in patients receiving mec. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was superior to placebo in preventing
ponv in the first 24 hours following surgery.  xxxd2834xxx  was generally well
tolerated in clinical trials. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is a valuable option in the
prevention of acute- and delayed-phase cinv in adult patients receiving mec,
and of acute-phase cinv in patients receiving hec. oral  xxxd2834xxx  is likely
to be a useful addition to oral formulations of other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists in
preventing cinv in patients receiving mec. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is a useful
alternative to currently recommended agents in ponv prevention.

pharmacological
properties

although all  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists prevent nausea and vomiting by selective
inhibition of 5-ht3 receptors,  xxxd2834xxx  is structurally different to, and has a
higher affinity for the  xxxg1116xxx  than, the other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists;
it is the only allosteric antagonist and has a long duration of action.  xxxd2834xxx 
has no clinically relevant effects on the cardiovascular system, including prolongation of the corrected qt interval.
the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is generally similar
between patients receiving chemotherapy and those undergoing surgery. oral
 xxxd2834xxx  has a bioavailability of 97%.  xxxd2834xxx  is extensively distributed
and is »62% bound to plasma proteins. cytochrome p450 (cyp) accounts for
»50% of  xxxd2834xxx  metabolism, mainly by cyp2d6, cyp3a4 and cyp1a2;

the major metabolites have minimal antagonistic activity (<1%) at the 5-ht3
receptor.  xxxd2834xxx  has a long terminal elimination half-life (mean »40 hours)
and is excreted mainly through the urinary route. dose adjustment of  xxxd2834xxx  is not needed on the basis of age, sex, race, renal or hepatic impairment,
concurrent medication or clinical chemistry.
therapeutic efficacy

in randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials, intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was
noninferior to intravenous ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing cinv in the
acute phase in patients receiving mec, with statistically better efficacy than
ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  in subsequent superiority analyses in the acute and
delayed phases. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to intravenous ondansetron or granisetron in preventing cinv in the acute phase following hec.
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in combination with dexamethasone with or without
 xxxd203xxx  was an effective cinv prophylactic regimen. oral  xxxd2834xxx  was
noninferior to intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing cinv in the acute phase in
patients receiving mec in another trial. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was generally
associated with better health-related quality-of-life outcomes compared with
intravenous ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  in patients receiving mec, or with
intravenous ondansetron in patients receiving hec. superior efficacy of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  over placebo in preventing ponv in the 0–24 hour time
period was established in two other trials.

pharmacoeconomic
considerations

cost analyses modelled on two european hospital perspectives in patients receiving mec or hec suggested pharmacoeconomic benefits associated with the
use of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with that of ondansetron or first-generation 5-ht3
receptor antagonists in the management of cinv. a large us observational
study (in patients receiving various chemotherapy regimens) reported a more
favourable financial impact following the use of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with that
of ondansetron for preventing cinv.

tolerability

in clinical trials, the intravenous and oral formulations of  xxxd2834xxx  were
generally well tolerated in patients receiving chemotherapy, and intravenous
 xxxd2834xxx  was generally well tolerated in surgical patients. the incidence of
reported adverse events was low (all <10%), and the majority of these were of mild
or moderate severity; no or few study withdrawals as a result of adverse events
were attributed to study medication. headache and constipation were among the
most commonly reported adverse events with the use of  xxxd2834xxx .

1. introduction
nausea and vomiting commonly follow chemotherapy or surgery, although incidences can vary
greatly (30–90%[1] for chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting [cinv] and 10–79%[2] for
postoperative nausea and vomiting [ponv]). inadequately controlled cinv and ponv may be
associated with consequences such as dehydration,
malnutrition or gastrointestinal bleeding,[3] or electrolyte imbalance, aspiration of gastric contents or

wound dehiscence.[4] these consequences may
lead to a reduced willingness by the patient
for future treatments[3] or delay discharge from
hospital.[4] importantly, cinv and ponv are
consistently among the most distressing effects
of chemotherapy[5] or surgery[6] as ranked by
patients.

reticularis) pathways involving several receptor
types (e.g. serotonin 5-ht3, dopamine d2, histamine h2, a2-adrenergic, neurokinin1 and gaba)
are implicated in the initiation of the vomiting reflex
in cinv[1,7] and ponv.[8] because many receptors
are involved in the neurotransmission of nausea and
vomiting signals, the recommended preventative
strategies involve a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action (section 8).
despite the many available agents and their
widespread use, some patients still experience
cinv[9] or ponv.[10] intravenous  xxxd2834xxx 
( xxxd2834xxx ), a second-generation  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist, was initially approved in 2003 for the
prevention of acute- or delayed-phase cinv
following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
(mec) or acute-phase cinv following highly
emetogenic chemotherapy (hec);[11,12] it is now
also indicated for the prevention of ponv in the
first 24 hours in the us.[13] in addition, an oral
formulation of  xxxd2834xxx  has recently (2008)
received us approval for acute-phase cinv
prophylaxis following mec, although it is not
currently available.[14]

2. pharmacodynamic properties
the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2834xxx  have been reviewed previously;[12,15,16]
therefore, only a brief summary is provided here,
based on studies,[17-21] a review,[1] the us[13,14] and
eu[22] prescribing information and the european
medicines agency (emea) scientific document.[23]
 xxxd2834xxx  is a highly selective  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist with distinct pharmacodynamic properties (table i). unlike other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists (e.g. ondansetron,  xxxd1924xxx , granisetron) that
resemble serotonin structurally,[1] the structure of
 xxxd2834xxx  is based on a fused tricyclic ring with
an attached quinucleidine moiety (figure 1).[17] interestingly,  xxxd2834xxx  was shown to be an allosteric antagonist of the  xxxg1116xxx  and displays
positive cooperativity, whereas granisetron and ondansetron are competitive antagonists and exhibit
simple bimolecular binding.[17] competitive antagonists of serotonin compete directly with serotonin
at the same binding sites, but allosteric binding

(i.e. binding at a different site compared to serotonin) creates a conformational change in the
serotonin receptor so that serotonin binding is indirectly inhibited.[16] in addition,  xxxd2834xxx 
exhibits a higher affinity for 5-ht3 receptors than
other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists (table i). it has a
long duration of action (7 hours with oral  xxxd2834xxx  vs 4 hours with an equally effective dose
of oral ondansetron in dogs following administration of cisplatin[18]), which is attributed to its
long plasma elimination half-life (section 3). preliminary in vitro data suggest that  xxxd2834xxx 
may cause receptor internalization, which may
also account for its long duration of action.[17] the
differential binding properties and long duration
of action of  xxxd2834xxx  may explain its improved efficacy versus  xxxd1924xxx  or ondansetron
in preventing delayed-phase cinv in patients receiving mec (section 4.1.1).
preliminary data from 35 patients with cancer
who received intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and
dexamethasone 20 mg 30 minutes prior to hec indicate a beneficial effect, as cinv prophylaxis with
 xxxd2834xxx  and dexamethasone was associated
with an increase in caloric food intake.[19]
although supratherapeutic doses of  xxxd2834xxx  have the potential to block ion channels
involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and to prolong action potential duration in
preclinical studies,[22,23] intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was not associated with individually
corrected qt (qtci) interval prolongation

in a ‘thorough qt/qtc’ study,[21] in accordance
with international conference on harmonisation
e14 guidelines.[24] in this study,[21] the change
in qtci interval was -3.6 msec with  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg, -2.9 msec with  xxxd2834xxx  0.50 mg
and -1.5 msec with  xxxd2834xxx  2.25 mg, compared with -4.1 msec with placebo and 1.8 msec
with the active comparator moxifloxacin
(n = 42–46 per group).
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2834xxx  discussed in this section are based on clinical
studies,[25-30] a review,[1] the manufacturer’s prescribing information[13,14,22] and the emea scientific discussion document.[23]
the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  1 or 3 mg/kg are presented in table ii;
these doses are equivalent to the recommended
doses of 0.075 mg for ponv and 0.25 mg for
cinv (section 7). the pharmacokinetic profile of
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is generally similar between patients receiving chemotherapy and those
undergoing surgery.[13]

to infinity over a dose range of 0.3 to 90 mg/kg in
healthy volunteers.[14,25]
 xxxd2834xxx  is extensively distributed,[23] with a
large apparent volume of distribution (table ii). at
concentrations of 5–412 nmol/ml,  xxxd2834xxx  is
»62% bound to plasma proteins; in in vitro studies,
the binding was nonspecific and nonsaturable.[23]
repeated administration of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg/day for 3 consecutive[26] or on
alternative[27] days with concomitant dexamethasone is associated with a mean accumulation
ratio of 2.1[26] and 1.4,[27] respectively.

3.2 metabolism and excretion

cytochrome p450 (cyp) n-oxidation and
monohydroxylation accounts for »50% of the
metabolism of  xxxd2834xxx , giving the major
metabolites m9 and m4, respectively; these metabolites contribute <1% of the  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonistic activity of  xxxd2834xxx  and are not
considered clinically significant.[23] cyp2d6 and,
to a lesser extent, cyp3a4 and cyp1a2, oxidize
 xxxd2834xxx  to m9.[23]
mean elimination half-life (t½) of  xxxd2834xxx  is »40 hours, although this is highly variable
and in »10% of patients it is 100–300 hours;
however, this variability is not expected to affect
clinical efficacy or safety.[23] the t½ of  xxxd2834xxx  is considerably longer than that of other
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists, which generally
range between 3 and 8 hours.[1] in healthy volunteers, after a single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx , total body clearance was 160 ml/h/kg[13]
or 173 ml/min[22] and renal clearance was
66.5 ml/h/kg[13] or 53 ml/min.[22]
renal excretion is the primary route of  xxxd2834xxx  clearance. following a single intravenous dose of [14c]- xxxd2834xxx  10 mg/kg, a
mean of 83.2% of the radioactivity was recovered
in the urine and 3.4% was recovered in the faeces.[28] of the dose recovered in the urine, a mean
of 39.3% was unchanged drug, 12.5% was m9
and 10.9% was m4.[28] after a single oral dose of
[14c]- xxxd2834xxx , 85–93% of the radioactivity
was recovered in the urine, with 5–8% recovered
in the faeces.[14]

3.3 special patient populations

the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2834xxx  were not significantly affected by mild to
moderate renal impairment, and although severe
renal impairment increased systemic exposure to
 xxxd2834xxx  by »28%, no dose adjustment is
needed in patients with renal impairment.[13,14,22]
the clearance of  xxxd2834xxx  was not significantly different between patients with hepatic
impairment and healthy volunteers; dose adjustment is not required in these patients.[13,14,22]
age, sex, race, concurrent medication or clinical chemistry had no effect on the clearance of
 xxxd2834xxx ; the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx  or m9 were not affected by metabolism
status (i.e. extensive vs poor metabolizers).[22,23]
3.4 potential drug interactions

although  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrated competitive inhibition of cyp1a2, cyp2d6 and
cyp3a4 in vitro, this inhibitory potential is not
considered relevant at therapeutic drug concentrations; no induction of cytochrome p450
isoenzymes was observed with clinically relevant
concentrations of  xxxd2834xxx  in vitro.[22,23]
coadministration of cyp2d6 inducers (dexamethasone, rifampicin [rifampin]) or inhibitors (including amiodarone, chlorpromazine,
fluoxetine, haloperidol, metoclopramide) with
 xxxd2834xxx  had no significant effect on the
clearance of  xxxd2834xxx .[13,14,22,23]
no significant interactions or inhibition of antitumour activity were observed following intraperitoneal injections of  xxxd2834xxx  with cisplatin,
cyclophosphamide,  xxxd1790xxx , doxorubicin or  xxxd2655xxx  c in mice.[13,14,22,23] in clinical trials (section 4),
 xxxd2834xxx  has been safely coadministered with
analgesics, anticholinergic agents, antiemetics, antinauseants, antispasmodics or corticosteroids.[13,14,22]
coadministration of intravenous dexamethasone
20 mg[13,14] or oral  xxxd203xxx  125 mg on day 1 and
80 mg on days 2 and 3[29] with intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2834xxx  in healthy volunteers (these are recommended combinations for cinv or ponv
prophylaxis [section 8]).

 xxxd2834xxx : a review

4. therapeutic efficacy
the efficacy of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in
the prevention of cinv[31-35] (section 4.1) or
ponv[36-38] (section 4.2) has been evaluated in
several randomized, double-blind, multicentre
trials in adult patients (aged ‡18 years); the discussion in this section focuses on these trials and
is limited to treatment arms that used the recommended doses (section 7) of  xxxd2834xxx .
one of these trials[35] utilized a double-dummy
design to evaluate the oral versus the intravenous

antiemetic rescue medication was permitted.[31-38] where reported,[31,33-38] there were
no significant differences between the study
groups in terms of baseline patient characteristics
within each trial.
4.1 chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting

in the pivotal cinv prevention trials, enrolled
patients had a karnofsky index (a functional
impairment scale; 100% indicates perfect health
and 0% indicates death) ‡50%[31-33] or ‡70%.[34]
both chemotherapy-naive or -experienced patients were included, although chemotherapyexperienced patients were excluded if they had
previously experienced greater than mild cinv.
inclusion of patients with hepatic, renal or cardiovascular impairment was at the discretion of
the investigator. patients were excluded if they:
had received or were scheduled to receive any
investigational drugs (including  xxxd2834xxx ) in
the previous 30 days; had received drugs with
potential antiemetic properties in the previous
24 hours or up to day 5 of the trial; were experiencing emesis or retching; had grade 2 or 3 nausea

common toxicity criteria in the 24 hours prior
to receiving chemotherapy; or had a baseline qtc
interval >500 msec.[31-34] inclusion and exclusion
criteria were not reported for the trial that evaluated oral  xxxd2834xxx  (available as abstract
and poster).[35]
patients received  xxxd2834xxx  0.25[31-34] or
0.75 mg,[31-33]  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg[31] or granisetron 3 mg[34] as a single intravenous bolus infused
over 30 seconds, or ondansetron 32 mg[32,33] as a
single intravenous bolus infused over 15 minutes,
30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.[35] in one
trial,[35] oral  xxxd2834xxx  was given as a single
dose of 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 mg 1 hour prior to
chemotherapy.[14] a single dose of concomitant
intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg, administered
15 minutes prior to chemotherapy, was permitted
at the investigator’s discretion in some
trials.[31,33,35] the lowest  xxxd2834xxx  dose
(0.25 mg) employed in these trials was established
as the minimum effective dose in a randomized,
double-blind, dose-ranging trial,[30] which utilized an equivalent dose (3 mg/kg). the regimens
in the trials[39,40] that utilized  xxxd2834xxx  in
combination with dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx 
for cinv prophylaxis (as recommended by
treatment guidelines [see section 8]) are discussed
in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.
the primary efficacy endpoint in the cinv
prevention trials[31-35] was the rate of complete
response (cr) [defined as no emetic episode
and no use of rescue medication] in the first
24 hours (i.e. the acute phase) following chemotherapy in the intent-to-treat population (i.e.
all randomized patients who received chemotherapy and study medication). noninferiority of
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  relative to the comparator was achieved if the lower boundary of the
97.5% confidence interval (ci) for the betweengroup difference was greater than -15%,[31-33] or
if the lower boundary of the 95% ci for the
between-group difference was >10%.[34] oral  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  if the lower boundary of the 98.3% ci
for the between-group difference was greater
than -15%.[14,35]
the effect of  xxxd2834xxx  as cinv prophylaxis
on hr-qol was examined in three trials,[31-33] using

ondansetron, in the delayed and overall phases
as assessed by cr and complete control (cc)
rates (table iii) [cc is defined as no emetic episode, no need for rescue medication and no
more than mild nausea]. in addition, relative to
ondansetron,  xxxd2834xxx  prophylaxis was associated with a significantly (p = 0.0003) prolonged time to treatment failure (i.e. time to
first emetic episode or use of rescue medication,

than ondansetron recipients were free of emetic
episodes in the acute (85% vs 71%), delayed (80%
vs 61%) and overall (75% vs 55%) phases (all values estimated from a graph). the number of
emetic episodes was significantly (p £ 0.05) lower
in the  xxxd2834xxx  than ondansetron group in
all three phases (numerical data not reported).[32]
comparison with  xxxd1924xxx 

in patients receiving mec, intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg was noninferior relative to intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg in preventing cinv
as assessed by the cr rate in the acute phase
(primary endpoint; table iii).[31] the cr rate was
significantly higher with  xxxd2834xxx  than with
 xxxd1924xxx  in the delayed and overall phases
(table iii). in addition, the cc rate was significantly higher with  xxxd2834xxx  than  xxxd1924xxx 
in the delayed and overall phases (table iii).  xxxd2834xxx  was associated with fewer emetic episodes (p £ 0.0183) in all phases, more patients
with no emetic episodes (p £ 0.028) in the delayed
and overall phases, and more patients with
no nausea on days 2 and 3 (p < 0.05) than  xxxd1924xxx  (numerical data not reported). the median
time to first emetic episode (>120 vs 41.5 hours)
and median time to treatment failure (51.1 vs
24.6 hours) was higher with  xxxd2834xxx  than
with  xxxd1924xxx  (all p < 0.05).[31]
health-related quality of life

intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg was generally associated with better hr-qol outcomes
following mec than intravenous ondansetron
32 mg or  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg in a pooled analysis[48] of data from two trials.[31,32] more patients
receiving  xxxd2834xxx  (n = 378) than those receiving ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx  (combined
n = 376) experienced ‘no impact of cinv on daily
life’ (nidl) in the acute-phase nausea (66% vs

64%) domains, and the delayed-phase nausea
(65% vs 54%), vomiting (79% vs 70%) and total
(70% vs 58%) domains (all p < 0.01). a significant
(p < 0.05) difference between  xxxd2834xxx  and

triple prophylactic regimen

the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  plus dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx  as cinv prophylaxis
was evaluated in an open-label, multicentre trial
in 58 patients receiving mec.[39] in this trial,
patients received intravenous  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on day
1, oral dexamethasone 12 mg 1 hour prior to
chemotherapy on day 1 and 8 mg on days 2 and 3,
and oral  xxxd203xxx  125 mg 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on day 1 and 80 mg on days 2 and 3.
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in combination
with oral dexamethasone and oral  xxxd203xxx 
was an effective cinv prophylactic regimen in
patients receiving mec in this open-label trial.[39]
the cr rate was 88% (acute phase) and 78%
(delayed and overall phases), with >90% of patients experiencing no emetic episode at any
timepoint.[39]
oral versus intravenous  xxxd2834xxx 

the efficacy of oral  xxxd2834xxx  0.50 mg was
noninferior to that of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg in preventing acute-phase cinv as assessed by cr rate in patients receiving mec[35]
(primary endpoint; figure 2). however, noninferiority between the oral and intravenous formulations of  xxxd2834xxx  was  xxxd3237xxx 
for the delayed and overall phases (figure 2). post
hoc equivalence was shown in terms of the number of patients not experiencing emesis in the
acute (82.5% vs 77.2%), delayed (73.8% vs 74.7%)
and overall (70.6% vs 67.3%) phases, and the
proportion of patients without nausea in the
acute (58.8% vs 57.4%), delayed (49.4% vs 47.5%)
and overall (45.6% vs 42.6%) phases (all p < 0.05,
the significance limit for the equivalence test of
proportions).[35] the majority of patients in any
treatment arm (79–97%) experienced no or mild
grade nausea.[35]
the addition of dexamethasone to cinv prophylaxis with  xxxd2834xxx  increased the cr rate in
the acute phase by »10–20%.[35] half of the patients
in this trial received concomitant dexamethasone
8 mg and the other half received placebo. subgroup

dexamethasone reported no significant differences
in the cr rates of recipients of oral compared with
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx , with generally similar
results in terms of secondary endpoints (numerical
data not reported).[49]
patient satisfaction with antiemetic treatment
was high with both formulations of  xxxd2834xxx , with patients in all treatment groups
reporting global satisfaction (up to day 5) of
>90 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale.[35]
4.1.2 in patients receiving highly
emetogenic chemotherapy

assessed by the cr rate in the acute phase (primary endpoint) [table iii].[33] noninferiority of
 xxxd2834xxx  relative to ondansetron was also
established in the delayed and overall phases
(table iii). more  xxxd2834xxx  than ondansetron recipients experienced no emetic episodes in
the delayed (56.5% vs 46.6%; p = 0.0137) and
overall (51.1% vs 39.4%; p = 0.013) phases, with
the median time to first emetic episode favouring
 xxxd2834xxx  prophylaxis (>120 vs 42.7 hours;
p = 0.023). subgroup analysis of data in patients
who received concomitant intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg showed a longer time to
treatment failure in the  xxxd2834xxx  than
the ondansetron group (48.2 vs 27.4 hours;
p = 0.032); other results from this subgroup of
patients support the results reported for the
overall patient population.[33]
comparison with granisetron

intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg was noninferior to intravenous granisetron 3 mg in preventing cinv associated with hec in the acute
phase, as assessed by cr rate (primary endpoint;
table iii).[34] the cr rate was not significantly
different between the  xxxd2834xxx  and granisetron groups for the delayed phase (table iii).[34]
the results of two other comparative
trials[50,51] of  xxxd2834xxx  versus granisetron are
discussed in section 8.
health-related quality of life

in patients receiving hec and  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg or ondansetron 32 mg for cinv prophylaxis,[33] the proportion of patients who experienced nidl in the acute phase was 74%
versus 66% (nausea domain), 81% versus 71%
(vomiting domain) and 78% versus 68% (total
domain); corresponding values for the delayed
phase were 55% versus 46%, 67% versus 66%
and 59% versus 52% (no statistical analyses
reported).

on days 2 and 3 (n = 28),  xxxd203xxx  125 mg on day 1
and placebo on days 2 and 3 (n = 27), or placebo on
days 1–3 (n = 16).
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  plus intravenous
dexamethasone and oral  xxxd203xxx  was an
effective combination in preventing cinv in
patients receiving hec.[40] the majority
(92.6–100%) of patients receiving  xxxd2834xxx 
plus dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx  did not experience emesis in the acute, delayed and overall
phases; 50.0–93.8% of those receiving  xxxd2834xxx  plus dexamethasone without  xxxd203xxx 
experienced no emesis (no statistical analysis
reported).[40]
4.1.3 in subpopulations

intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is effective in preventing cinv in elderly patients. in an openlabel trial[41] in adult patients (aged ‡18 years)
receiving  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and intravenous
dexamethasone (16 mg on day 1, 8 mg every
12 hours on days 2 and 3, and 4 mg every 12 hours
on days 4 and 5) followed by mec or hec, no
statistically significant difference in cr or cc
rates (in all phases) was observed between nonelderly (aged <65 years; n = 24) and elderly (aged
‡65 years; n = 23) patients. in a pooled analysis[45]
of the data from the elderly patients of two mec
trials,[31,32] a significant difference at the prespecified level of p < 0.025 in the cr rates was
demonstrated between patients receiving  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg (n = 79) and ondansetron 32 mg
or  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg (n = 86) in the delayed
(72.2% vs 53.5%; p = 0.016) and overall (70.9% vs

lower boundary of the 95% ci of the between-group
difference met the prespecified criteria of greater

n = 149) or did not (53.6–59.5%; n = 151) receive oral
dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily on days 2 and 3.[42]
the reduced need for concomitant dexamethasone associated with  xxxd2834xxx  for
cinv prophylaxis[42] was supported by the
findings of a subgroup analysis (abstract presentation) of data from 324 patients.[52] no significant (all p > 0.05) difference was found in
the cr rates between patients who received
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and intravenous dexamethasone 8 mg only on day 1 and
those who also received oral dexamethasone 8 mg
on days 2 and 3, prior to receiving an anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide regimen (55.8% vs
60.7%) or another mec regimen (68.5% vs
72.0%).[52]
4.1.4 meta-analysis and
postmarketing surveillance

a meta-analysis (abstract presentation) of
randomized clinical trials that compared intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg with other
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists indicated a favourable cinv prophylaxis outcome with  xxxd2834xxx  relative to ondansetron, granisetron and
 xxxd1924xxx .[43] in 1298 patients, acute-phase
nausea (relative risk [rr] 0.75 [95% ci 0.64, 0.88;
p = 0.004]), delayed-phase nausea (rr 0.73 [95%
ci 0.66, 0.82; p < 0.00001]), acute-phase vomiting
(rr 0.78 [95% ci 0.67, 0.90; p = 0.0008]) and
delayed-phase vomiting (rr 0.75 [95% ci 0.67,
0.84; p < 0.00001]) occurred less frequently with
 xxxd2834xxx  than ondansetron, granisetron or
 xxxd1924xxx .[43]
data from a postmarketing surveillance programme[44] conducted in the clinical practice
setting supported the prophylactic efficacy of
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  established in clinical
trials[31-34] (sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). the combined cr rates in 135 patients who received
mec or hec (50% for each) and a single dose of
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg were 87% (95% ci 81, 93)
for day 1 and 72% (95% ci 64, 80) for days 2–5
(p < 0.05 for day 1 vs 2–5).[44]

co-primary endpoint of cr rate for the 24–72
hours period in two trials.[36,37] superiority of
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  relative to placebo was
established if the between-group difference was
statistically significant at p < 0.0167 (the prespecified level of statistical significance).[36,37]
the effect of  xxxd2834xxx  as ponv prophylaxis on hr-qol was examined in one trial[36]
using the european organization for research
and treatment of cancer (eortc) qlq-c30
questionnaire; the eortc qlq-c30 questionnaire was designed for, and validated in,
patients receiving chemotherapy, not surgical
patients.[55,56]
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was generally superior to placebo in preventing ponv in surgical
patients (table iv). the cr rates were higher
with  xxxd2834xxx  0.075 mg or 1 mg/kg (considered equivalent doses) than with placebo in the
0–24 hours period (primary or co-primary endpoint) in three trials;[36-38] however, the difference
in cr rates was significant in the 24–72 hours
period (co-primary endpoint) in only one[37] of
two[36,37] trials (table iv).
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.075 mg or 1 mg/kg
demonstrated better efficacy than placebo in
preventing ponv as assessed by some, but not
all, secondary endpoints, including the cr rate
for the 0–72 hours period (table iv) and the

patients had an american society of anesthesiologists physical status class of i to iii (i.e.
normal, healthy patient or patient with mild to
severe, but not constantly life-threatening, systemic disease)[53] and were scheduled to undergo
surgery of ‡1 hour’s duration. all patients had at
least two risk factors for ponv, including female
gender, nonsmoking status of ‡12 months or a
history of ponv or  xxxd1892xxx . patients
receiving chemotherapy in the previous 4 weeks
or emetogenic radiotherapy in the previous
8 weeks were excluded from these trials.[36,37] inclusion and exclusion criteria were not reported
for another ponv prevention trial (abstract
presentation), although all enrolled patients were
women.[38] results for a subset of patients[54]
from this latter trial[38] are not discussed.
in the ponv prevention trials, patients received
a single intravenous bolus of  xxxd2834xxx  0.025,
0.05 or 0.075 mg,[36,37] or 0.130 mg/kg[38] (0.075 mg
and 1 mg/kg are considered equivalent doses), or
placebo, infused over 10 seconds and administered
no more than 5 minutes before the induction of
anaesthesia[36,37] or at the time of skin closure.[38]

 xxxd2834xxx : a review

number of patients not experiencing vomiting or
nausea in the first 0–24 hours (table iv).[36,37] the
time to treatment failure (as assessed by kaplanmeier analysis) was significantly (p £ 0.0185)
longer in recipients of  xxxd2834xxx  0.075 mg
than in those receiving placebo.[36,37]
hr-qol outcomes in surgical patients were
generally better in those receiving  xxxd2834xxx 
than placebo for ponv prophylaxis.[36] intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was associated with a
significantly (p £ 0.03) greater improvement in
patient functioning than placebo for the total
score and the appetite (57% vs 44%), social life
(73% vs 62%) and enjoyment of life (66% vs 57%)
subdomains of the eortc qlq-c30 questionnaire, but not for the sleep (73% vs 64%) or
physical activity (65% vs 59%) subdomains.[36]
5. pharmacoeconomic considerations
the pharmacoeconomics of  xxxd2834xxx 
prophylaxis have been reported in three studies.[57-59] two[57,58] of these studies analysed the
cost of managing cinv following prophylaxis
with a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg from a
healthcare payer’s perspective in european
countries, utilized a 5-[57] or 6-day[58] decision tree
model and obtained efficacy data from clinical
trials. one study[57] compared  xxxd2834xxx  with
intravenous ondansetron 32 mg and was based on
a hospital perspective of five european countries
(germany, italy, russia, the netherlands and
uk). the other study[58] was conducted from the
italian national health service perspective and
compared  xxxd2834xxx  with various regimens
of repeated dosages of oral or intravenous
first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists. the
third study was a large, retrospective, cost analysis in a us oncology practice setting, based
on an integrated medical records and billing
database.[59]
in a european model of patients who received
mec, the use of a single dose of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg as cinv prophylaxis was estimated to have a favourable drug price ratio relative
to intravenous ondansetron 32 mg.[57]  xxxd2834xxx 
prophylaxis was estimated to reduce emetic episodes
by 2.31 and rescue medications by 0.29 units

compared with ondansetron; therefore, to provide a
lower than or equal to net treatment cost for the
hospital, the price of  xxxd2834xxx  can be higher
than ondansetron by 1.55- to 2.60-fold, depending
on the country (where reported, 2002 or 2003 costs
were used). in sensitivity analysis,  xxxd2834xxx  remained the preferred agent in all scenarios in all five
countries (drug price ratio 1.03–1.23).[57]
in an italian model of patients who received
mec or hec,[58] cinv prophylaxis with intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was cost saving relative
to intravenous and/or oral first-generation 5-ht3
receptor antagonist. the management of cinv
was predicted to cost h26 less with  xxxd2834xxx 
than a first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist (h92 vs h118) because of differences in the
cost of drug acquisition (h72 vs h93 [weighted
mean cost]) and management of emesis (h20 vs
 xxxd1544xxx ) [all 2006 values]. the favourable costs with
 xxxd2834xxx  prophylaxis reflects that only a
single dose is required compared with repeated
administration of comparator agents, and  xxxd2834xxx  had better input efficacy leading to an
estimated reduced need for the management of
emesis. in sensitivity analysis, the results were
robust to a 10% increase or decrease in key
parameters.[58]
in the retrospective us study in patients who
received various chemotherapy regimens (including mec and hec), intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg prophylaxis was associated with
lower costs than intravenous ondansetron 32 mg,
based on data from an integrated medical records
and billing database (2005–6 costs).[59] an extreme cinv event (defined as cinv requiring
medical attention) was experienced by 4.0% of
1558  xxxd2834xxx  and 12.3% of 1287 ondansetron recipients in cycle 1 (105 vs 325 extreme
cinv events were reported for cycles 2–6), resulting in an overall impact over a 2-year period
of 42 840 minutes in terms of management time
with  xxxd2834xxx  prophylaxis and 123 165 minutes with ondansetron prophylaxis (representing
a 2.9-fold increase).[59]
pharmacoeconomic analyses, including those of
 xxxd2834xxx , are subject to a number of limitations.

pooled data, obtained from the us prescribing information,[13] of adverse events with an incidence ‡2% in any treatment arm in phase iii,
randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials.[31-33] pts received pal, ondansetron (ond) or  xxxd1924xxx  (dol) intravenously 30 minutes prior to
chemotherapy (see section 4 for additional trial design details). data for the nonapproved pal dose groups are not shown.

extrapolate the results of such trials to the general
population; however, patient populations, rates
of compliance and major outcomes in clinical
trials may differ from those observed in real-life
practice. modelled analyses, such as the two[57,58]
presented in this section, rely on a number of
assumptions and use data from a variety of
sources. results of pharmacoeconomic analyses
may not be applicable to other geographical regions because of differences in healthcare systems, medical practice and unit costs. despite
these inherent limitations, currently available
studies suggest that the use of  xxxd2834xxx  as
cinv prophylaxis has pharmacoeconomic benefits relative to that with first-generation 5-ht3
receptor antagonists.

6. tolerability
the tolerability data for intravenous or oral
 xxxd2834xxx  were obtained from clinical
trials,[31-38,41] a meta-analysis[43] and a retrospective analysis[45] of data from elderly patients
(study design details are presented in section 4),
the us[13,14] and eu[22] prescribing information
and the emea scientific discussion document.[23]
discussion of data is primarily based on the recommended doses of  xxxd2834xxx  (section 7).

6.1 chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting

intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was generally
well tolerated in clinical trials of cinv prevention.[31-34] the majority of adverse events were
mild (64.1% of 582[31]) or mild to moderate (>90%
of 673[33]) in severity, and »80%[31-33] were not
considered to be related to study medication. the
most common adverse events reported with intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in a pooled analysis[13] of
three cinv trials[31-33] are presented in figure 3.
no clinically relevant differences were reported in
terms of the incidence or duration of all or
treatment-emergent adverse events between  xxxd2834xxx  and ondansetron,[32,33]  xxxd1924xxx [31]
or granisetron.[34]
results from a meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials did not demonstrate a significant difference in the incidence of common adverse events
associated with  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists between intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  and ondansetron,
granisetron or  xxxd1924xxx .[43] the rr of headache
(0.83), dizziness (0.40), constipation (1.35) and
diarrhoea (0.67) of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with
ondansetron, granisetron and  xxxd1924xxx  were all
statistically insignificant (all p > 0.05).[43]
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was generally well
tolerated by elderly patients,[45] including those
previously experiencing grade 3–4 cinv.[41]
drugs 2009; 69 (16)

 xxxd2834xxx : a review

few serious adverse events (<5%) were reported in clinical trials, and none were considered
related to the study medication.[31-34] no patient
deaths were considered to be related to study
medication.[31,32] where reported, no[31] or few[32]
study withdrawals as a result of adverse events
were considered to be related to study medication; one patient who received intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg (a higher than recommended
dose; section 7) withdrew because of debility
that was considered at least possibly related to
 xxxd2834xxx .[32]
in clinical trials, no clinically relevant difference in vital signs, ecg or laboratory tests were
observed between  xxxd2834xxx  and  xxxd1924xxx [31] or ondansetron,[32,33] or in qtc interval
prolongation between  xxxd2834xxx  and placebo.
no relevant supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) or atrioventricular conduction defects were reported
with the use of  xxxd2834xxx  prophylaxis.[23]
postmarketing experience of intravenous
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg in cinv prophylaxis reported mild adverse events (vertigo and dyspepsia) in 1.5% of 135 patients.[44] postmarketing
cases of hypersensitivity reactions and injectionsite reactions (including burning, discomfort
or pain) have been reported with the use of
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg for cinv
prevention.[13]
oral  xxxd2834xxx  was generally well tolerated
in mec recipients. in a dose-ranging trial in
cinv prevention,[35] headache was reported in
3.7% of oral  xxxd2834xxx  0.50 mg (n = 161)
and 8.6% of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg
(n = 163) recipients and constipation in 0.6%
and 3.1% of patients. all other adverse events
(e.g. fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, myalgia or
postural dizziness) occurred at an incidence of
£1%.[14] the majority of adverse events were
mild in severity; no dose-dependent relationship
in the incidence of adverse events was observed
in oral  xxxd2834xxx  0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 mg
groups.[35]

6.2 postoperative nausea and vomiting

intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was generally well
tolerated in adult patients receiving the drug for
ponv prevention.[37] most adverse events were
mild or moderate in severity and the incidence of
adverse events was not significantly different to
that with placebo (statistical analyses not reported).[37] the most commonly reported adverse
events in a pooled analysis[13] of three ponv
prevention trials[36-38] with  xxxd2834xxx  are
presented in figure 4.
treatment-related adverse events were reported in 7% of  xxxd2834xxx  0.075 mg (n = 138)
and 10% of placebo (n = 135) recipients.[36] unspecified severe adverse events were reported
in 4% of  xxxd2834xxx  0.075 mg (n = 135) and 5%
of placebo (n = 136) recipients.[37] no withdrawals because of serious adverse events were
reported.[36]
in ponv trials, qt interval prolongation was
among the most frequently reported adverse events
(figure 4). however, a pooled analysis[60] of all three
ponv trials[36-38] did not demonstrate a dosedependent relationship in the incidence of qtc interval prolongation, and the change from baseline was
not significantly different to that seen in the placebo
group; therefore, the reported cases of qtc interval

7. dosage and administration
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is widely recommended in adult patients for the prevention of
cinv and, in the us, for the prevention of
ponv;[13] the recommended usage of intravenous
 xxxd2834xxx  is presented in table v. although a
single 0.5 mg oral dose of oral  xxxd2834xxx  has
been approved for the prevention of acute phase
cinv in the us,[14] it is not currently available.
 xxxd2834xxx  should only be given to pregnant
patients if its use is considered essential by
the physician (pregnancy category b); the use of
 xxxd2834xxx  by nursing mothers should be
avoided.[13,14,22]
the local manufacturer’s prescribing information should be consulted for detailed information
regarding contraindications, warnings, drug interactions, patient monitoring recommendations
and use in special patient populations.
8. place of  xxxd2834xxx  in the
prevention of nausea and vomiting
patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy or
to undergo surgery rank nausea and vomiting
among the top four treatment-related consequences that cause concern.[5,6] however, the
persistence of cinv[9] and ponv[10] despite the
numerous available agents and the use of combination prophylaxis (section 1) indicate that
cinv and ponv continue to be inadequately
controlled. a reduction in the incidence of cinv
and ponv would have significant benefits on
patient recovery and hr-qol,[61] as well as decreasing the financial burden in the management
of cancer or surgical patients.[4,11]
ª 2009 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

the management of cinv or ponv should
include identification of the risk factors (e.g. female sex, emetogenicity of the chemotherapy,
anaesthetic or analgesic agents, history of motion
sickness[2-4]) to help determine the most appropriate prophylactic regimen, which may range
from no prophylaxis or nonpharmacological intervention (e.g. p6 acupressure) in patients at low
risk to a combination of multiple antiemetic
agents in patients with higher risk.[4,11] recommendations from key treatment guidelines of
the use of pharmacological antiemetic agents for
cinv or ponv are presented in table vi.
since their introduction,  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists have been widely investigated and used
in cinv[3] or ponv[8] prevention and have become the cornerstone in the prevention of
cinv.[11] although  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
are often recommended interchangeably (table vi),
resistance to one agent does not exclude the efficacy of another agent;[68] the pharmacological
differences between members of this class of
drugs (including  xxxd2834xxx ) and genetic
polymorphism may account for the lack of cross
resistance.[15]
key pharmacological properties of  xxxd2834xxx  distinguish it from the other  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists.[69] these differences include a chemical structure that does not resemble serotonin
(and other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists), a higher
affinity for the  xxxg1116xxx  than other 5-ht3
receptor antagonists, a long duration of action
(section 2) and a long half-life (section 3). but,
like other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists in general,[70]  xxxd2834xxx  has a low risk of drug-drug
interactions (section 3), which may be of benefit
in patients scheduled to receive other drugs,
including chemotherapy or anaesthetic agents,
other antiemetic agents or treatments for concurrent disorders.

in adult patients (including the elderly),
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was shown to have
noninferior efficacy relative to intravenous ondansetron or intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing acute-phase cinv following mec (with
statistically better efficacy than ondansetron),
and to intravenous ondansetron or intravenous
granisetron in preventing acute-phase cinv following hec (section 4.1). importantly, intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrated statistically
better efficacy in terms of cr and cc rates in the
delayed phase than intravenous ondansetron or
 xxxd1924xxx  in mec trials (section 4.1.1).
ª 2009 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

current guidelines (table vi) typically recommend a combination of a  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist with dexamethasone and  xxxd203xxx 
for cinv prevention, but the trials discussed in
section 4.1 did not always include dexamethasone
and only two trials[39,40] included  xxxd203xxx . the
three-drug combination has demonstrated good
efficacy in patients receiving mec (section 4.1.1)
or hec (section 4.1.2).
a recent meta-analyses (abstract presentation)[71]
reported statistically similar efficacy (in terms of cr
rates) between intravenous or oral  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg and 0.75 mg (0.25 mg is the only approved
drugs 2009; 69 (16)

2274

intravenous dose and 0.50 mg is the only approved oral dose [section 7]). using data from
1926 patients enrolled in eight randomized, doubleblind clinical trials, the rr of cr rates between
 xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg and 0.25 mg was 0.958–
1.102 in patients receiving mec or hec, for
acute emesis or delayed emesis (all p > 0.27).[71]
this similarity in efficacy between the two  xxxd2834xxx  doses was supported by another metaanalysis (abstract presentation) of data from
1947 patients.[72]
in light of the similar efficacy between  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 and 0.75 mg doses as suggested
by these meta-analyses,[71,72] results from a recent, large (n = 1114), randomized, double-blind,
double-dummy, multicentre, phase iii trial[50]
warrant discussion. in this trial, intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg plus dexamethasone 16 mg
was noninferior to intravenous granisetron
40 mg/kg plus dexamethasone 16 mg in the acute
phase in patients receiving hec (75.3% vs 73.3%;
95% ci for the between-group difference -2.70,
7.27) [co-primary endpoint].[50] in addition, a
statistically significant difference was reported
for the cr rate in the delayed phase between
the  xxxd2834xxx  and the granisetron groups
(56.8% vs 44.5%; 95% ci 6.39, 18.04; p < 0.0001)
[co-primary endpoint]. secondary endpoint findings (e.g. cc rates, patients with no nausea and
patients with no emetic episodes) were in support
of the co-primary endpoint findings. no clinically
relevant difference in the incidence of adverse
events were reported between the treatment
arms.[50]
the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing cinv
is further supported by a randomized, double-blind,
double-dummy, multicentre trial (abstract and poster presentation)[51] that compared intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg with subcutaneous granisetron
sustained release (apf530). although not an approved formulation, apf530 is designed to release
the granisetron over a 5-day period. in this trial,
noninferiority (achieved if the lower boundary of the
95% ci for the between-group difference was less
than -15%) was established between granisetron
5 mg (apf530 250 mg), 10 mg (apf530 500 mg)
and  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg in preventing cinv in the

acute, delayed and overall phases following mec or
hec (48.6–77.7%, 54.2–81.3% vs 52.4–80.7%).[51]
these additional efficacy findings[50,51,71,72]
have led to a recent national comprehensive
cancer network guideline[65] change, which specifies intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  as the preferred
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist for the prevention of
cinv following hec (table vi). a change to the
multinational association for supportive care in
cancer and the european society for medical
oncology guidelines has recently been proposed,
to recommend  xxxd2834xxx  as the preferred
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist in the prevention of
cinv following mec.[73]
although not currently approved for use in
paediatric patients (section 7), the use of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  as cinv prophylaxis
has been investigated in two trials in paediatric
patients who received mec[74] or hec.[74,75]
oral  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  in the prevention of
acute- and delayed-phase cinv in patients
receiving mec (section 4.1.1). as other 5-ht3
receptor antagonists are also available in oral
formulations,[62] comparative efficacy trials of oral
 xxxd2834xxx  with these drugs are warranted.
intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was superior to
placebo in the prevention of ponv in the first
24 hours following surgery in two large noninferiority trials,[36,37] but the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  was statistically greater than placebo in the
24–72 hour time period in only one[37] of these
trials (section 4.2). interestingly, other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists also demonstrate better efficacy during the early than the later phase of
ponv.[8] comparative studies between  xxxd2834xxx  and other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
would be beneficial in fully determining the relative position of these agents for the prophylaxis
of ponv.
hr-qol results from clinical studies generally support the use of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  over that of ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx 
in preventing cinv in patients receiving mec,
and of ondansetron in patients receiving hec
(section 4.1). intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was
associated with better patient functioning than
placebo when given as ponv prophylaxis

 xxxd2834xxx : a review

(section 4.2). additional studies of the effect of
oral  xxxd2834xxx  compared with other oral
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists as cinv prophylaxis, or of intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  and other
intravenous  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists in
ponv prophylaxis, would be of interest.
in addition to the clinical benefits associated
with cinv prophylaxis, there are also financial
benefits. based on data from 20 community oncology practices, the cost of managing an extreme
cinv event (i.e. failed cinv prophylaxis) was
estimated to be $us175 (2005 values), requiring
255 minutes of an advanced practice nurse or a
physician’s time.[76] results from two european
cost models and a retrospective analysis of a us
medical database indicate pharmacoeconomic
advantages associated with the use of  xxxd2834xxx  over that of ondansetron or other 5-ht3
receptor antagonists as cinv prophylaxis (section 5). however, input data (e.g. those for
hr-qol) are limited in the two modelled studies,[57,58] and affect the robustness of the pharmacoeconomic estimates. it would be of interest
for future pharmacoeconomic models to compare both the efficacy and acquisition-cost ratios
of  xxxd2834xxx  with that of other 5-ht3
receptor antagonists. in addition, pharmacoeconomic studies comparing intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  with other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists in
ponv prophylaxis are needed.
like other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists,[3,11,69]
 xxxd2834xxx  was associated with a good tolerability profile in clinical trials. the most commonly reported adverse events, mostly of mild to
moderate severity, following administration of
 xxxd2834xxx  include headache and constipation
(section 6), which are typical of all  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists.[11] importantly,  xxxd2834xxx 
is not associated with qtc interval prolongation
(section 6) or other adverse cardiac effects (section 2), which is of clinical advantage as some
chemotherapy agents (e.g. cisplatin,  xxxd226xxx [77]) or anaesthetic drugs (e.g.  xxxd3197xxx ,
sufentanil[78]) may prolong the qtc interval or
cause arrhythmias.
in conclusion, in large, double-blind trials, intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to intravenous
ondansetron (with statistically greater efficacy than

ondansetron) or intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing acute- and delayed-phase cinv associated with
mec, and to intravenous ondansetron or granisetron in preventing acute-phase cinv associated
with hec. the oral formulation of  xxxd2834xxx 
was noninferior to the intravenous formulation as
prophylactic treatment for acute-phase cinv in
patients receiving mec in another large, double
blind-trial. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was superior
to placebo in preventing ponv in the first 24 hours
following surgery in two large, double-blind trials.
 xxxd2834xxx  was generally well tolerated in participants in clinical trials. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  is
a valuable option in the prevention of acute- and
delayed-phase cinv in adult patients receiving
mec, and of acute-phase cinv in patients receiving hec. oral  xxxd2834xxx  is likely to be a useful
alternative to existing oral formulations of 5-ht3
receptor antagonists in preventing cinv in patients receiving mec, as is intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  to currently recommended agents in ponv
prevention.
