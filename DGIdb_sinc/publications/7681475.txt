 xxxd1868xxx 
is a clinically used potent hypotensive agent
that produces vasodilatation by opening atp-sensitive k+
channels (k,,, channels) in smooth muscles (quast and
cook 1989; treischman et al. 1988). these channels are

blocked in normoxic-normoglycemic conditions by intracellular concentration of atp ([ atp],) in the millimolar
range and are activated when [ atpi; is decreased, leading
to membrane hyperpolarization (noma 1983). they constitute, therefore, a link between cellular metabolism and
membrane excitability (ashcroft et al. 1986; findlay et al.
1985; kakei et al. 1985; trube and hescheler 1984). k,,,
channels have been described in several other peripheral
structures, in particular in pancreatic p-cells, where they
participate in the modulation of insulin secretion (ashcroft
et al. 1985; cook and hales 1984). more recently, k,,,
channels have also been found in the cns. intracellular
studies on slices and patch-clamp experiments on cultured
neurons provided evidences for k,,, channels in brain
structures including cortical, hippocampal, and hypothalamic areas (ashford et al. 1988, 1990; hausser et al. 1991;
politi and rogawski 199 1; tromba et al. 199 1). in addition, binding sites for  xxxd2215xxx  (a k,,, channel
blocker) (mourre et al. 1989; zini et al. 199 1) and for galanine (a k,,, channel opener) (fisone et al. 1989) have
been described in some structures of the cns, notably in
the ca3 area of the hippocampus; more recently it has been
shown that, in ca3 region,  xxxd2215xxx  binding sites
were particularly enriched on the mossy fiber terminals,
which impinge on the proximal part of the ca3 pyramidal
cells (tremblay et al. 199 1). to examine possible modulations of k,,, channels in the cns and their effects on neuronal excitability in normal and pathological conditions, a
large number of pharmacological investigations have been
performed ( alzheimer and bruggencate 1988; ben-ari
1990; ben-ari et al. 1990; gandolfo et al. 1989; grigg and
anderson 1989; popoli et al. 1991). in ca3 hippocampal
neurons, sulphonylureas have been reported to increase the
anoxic depolarization ( mediated by glutamate release),
whereas  xxxd1868xxx  (ben-ari et al. 1990) and galanine (benari 1990) reduced it. these studies, therefore, raise the possibility that blockers and openers of k,,, channels may
modulate synaptic transmission and provide a useful tool
for reducing the enhanced excitability drive that occurs in
conditions of metabolic stress.to determine the potency of
these molecules on glutamatergic synaptic transmission, we
have now tested in the hippocampus the effects of  xxxd1868xxx 
on glutamatergic and gabaergic synaptic potentials and
on the currents generated in pyramidal neurons by application of both glutamate and gaba agonists. our observations show that  xxxd1868xxx  enhances glutamatergic responsesand reduces gabaergic responsesand thus generates interictal activities in the sensitive ca3 area.

summary

and

conclusions

1. the effect of  xxxd1868xxx ,
an opener of atp-sensitive
k+
channels (k,,, channels) has been investigated in the rat hippocampal slices by the use of extracellular and intracellular
recording
techniques.
2. in control solution,  xxxd1868xxx  enhanced the ca1 and ca3
field excitatory postsynaptic potentials ( epsps) and produced interictal activities in ca3. these effects were neither prevented by
k atp blockers, including  xxxd2215xxx 
(3-30 pm) or  xxxd3394xxx  (500 pm), nor mimicked by another ka-i-p opener such as
galanine ( 1 pm); thus these effects are probably not mediated by
k atp channels.
3. using intracellular
recording, we then studied, in ca3 pyramidal neurons, the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on the epsps and the fast
and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( ipsps).
4. in presence of bicuculline ( 10 pm) and phaclofen (50 pm),
to block, respectively, fast and slow ipsps,  xxxd1868xxx  reversibly
enhanced the epsps.
5. in presence
of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(cnqx; 10 pm), to block epsps,  xxxd1868xxx  reversibly decreased
both fast and slow ipsps.
6. these effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on the epsps and fast and slow
ipsps were associated neither with a change of the reversal potential of the epsps or the fast and slow ipsps nor with a change of
the input resistance and membrane potential.
7. using single electrode voltage-clamp
technique, we then
tested the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on the currents generated by applications of glutamate or y-aminobutyric
acid (gaba)
-a and -b
analogues.
8. in presence of tetrodotoxin
(ttx; 1 pm),  xxxd1868xxx  reversibly enhanced the peak currents evoked by a-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
( ampa; 3-5 pm ),  xxxd3068xxx  ( 510 pm) and n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda;
10 pm), but not
those evoked by kainate ( l-3 pm).
9. in presence of ttx ( 1 pm),  xxxd1868xxx  reversibly decreased
the gaba- ( l-5 mm), isoguvacine- (30-60 pm), and baclofen( 1o-30 pm) mediated peak currents.
10. it is concluded that, in the hippocampus,
 xxxd1868xxx  enhances the excitatory glutamatergic currents and reduces the gabaergic inhibition,
thus generating paroxystic activities. we suggest that these effects are mediated by second messenger cascades.

methods

slice prepurat ion
experiments were performed in vitro on hippocampal
slices in
the ca3 or ca1 areas. the slices were prepared from adult male
wistar rats, as described elsewhere (ben-ari
and cherubini
1988 ). in brief, rats were anesthetized with ether and decapitated;
the brain was removed and submerged in artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (acsf) of the following composition
(in mm): 126 nacl,
3.5 kcl, 2.0 caci,, 1.3 mgci,, 1.2 nah,po,, 25 nahco, and 1 1
glucose (ph 7.3) equilibrated with 95% o2 5% c02. slices, ~500
pm thick, were cut using a mcilwain tissue chopper and incubated
at room temperature in acsf for 2 1 h before use.

electrophysiological

recordings and data

individual slices were transferred to a submerged-type chamber
and superfused with acsf at 3.0-3.5 ml/min
at 34oc. in each
slice, a knife cut was performed to isolate ca 1 from ca3 region. a
bipolar tungsten-wire
electrode was placed either in the stratum
radiatum of ca 1 area, to elicit schaffer collateral excitatory postsynaptic potentials ( epsps) in ca 1, or above the stratum lucidum
of ca3 area, to elicit associational commissural
epsps in ca3.
the intensity of the stimulation
was adjusted to be below the
threshold required to evoke spikes. stimulation
parameters were
25- to 50-ps duration, 20- to 50-v intensity, and 0.033-hz frequency.

extracellular
recordings were made with glass microelectrodes
(2-3 ma) filled with 3m nacl. recordings in ca 1 and ca3 were
performed at the level of the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells.
intracellular recordings were made in ca3 area. ca3 pyramidal
neurons were penetrated with glass microelectrodes
(60- 150 m62)
filled either with 3m kc1 or 2m potassium methylsulfate. current
was injected through the recording electrode: bridge balance was
checked repeatedly during the experiment. capacitative transients
were reduced to a minimum
by negative capacity compensation.
membrane
potential was estimated from the potential observed
on withdrawal
of the electrode from the cell. single-electrode
voltage clamping was done with an axoclamp 2 amplifier operating in
the discontinuous
mode, usually at a frequency of 3-5 khz, a gain
of 25 na/mv, and the bandwidth
upper limit set at 0.3-l khz.
the voltage signal at the head stage amplifier was continuously
monitored on a separate oscilloscope to ensure optimal voltage
clamping. responses were digitized and displayed on a nicolet
digital oscilloscope and a computer driven chart recorder. data
are presented as means t se and statistical significance was assessed by the use of student’s t test analysis. the differences were
considered significant when p i 0.05.

solutions

and drugs

drugs were dissolved in acsf and applied in the perfusing medium via a three-way tap system. the high ratio of flow rate to
bath volume ensured complete exchange within 1 min. the drugs

extracellular recordings of ca1 and ca3 field epsps
were obtained from 20 slices. the mean amplitude of the
ca 1 and ca3 field epsps was 5 10 t 3 and 305 t 15 pv,
respectively.
bath application of 600 pm  xxxd1868xxx , for 10 min, induced several changes in the ca1 and ca3 field epsps
without modifying the afferent volley. thus, in cal,  xxxd1868xxx  increased significantly the slope (29 t 2%, n = 15,
p 5 o.ooos), the amplitude (30.75 t 2%, n = 15, p 5
o.ooos), and the duration (26.7 t 2%, n = 15, p 5 0.0005)
of the field epsps (fig. 1). the slope and the amplitude of
the field epsps reached their maximum
values 6.7 t 0.4
and 6.9 t 1 min, respectively, from the onset of  xxxd1868xxx 
application, whereas 11.7 t 0.5 min are required to obtain a
maximum
effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on the duration of the field
epsps, as shown in fig. 1b. these effects washed out
within 40-55 min after removal of the drug.

reversibly
increased  xxxd3068xxx -mediated
inward currents,
but not those generated
by kainate. a:
inward currents, recorded from a pyramidal
neuron in ca3 hippocampal
area (resting potential
p-83 mv), induced by bath
application
(20 s) of  xxxd3068xxx 
( 5 pm) before (a), during (h), and after (c) bath application
of  xxxd1868xxx 
(600 pm).
voltage pulses ( .- 10-mv amplitude
and l-s duration)
were applied every 10 s to measure input conductance.
h: inward
currents,
recorded from same pyramidal
neuron as in a (resting potential
-83 mv). induced by bath application
( 10 s) of
kainate ( 1 fm ) before (u), during (h), and after (0 bath application
of  xxxd1868xxx 
(600 pm ). voltage pulses ( - 10-mv
amplitude
and l-s duration)
were applied every 10 s to measure input conductance.

in the ca3 area,  xxxd1868xxx  generated population spikes
and frequently spontaneous interictal discharges (fig. 1, d
and e). the population spikes and evoked discharges disappeared after washout of the drug (40-55 min), but the
spontaneous i nterictal activi ties persisted. to study the effeet of diazox ide in absence of the interictal discha rges in
ca3, we performed experiments in presence of acsf containing a high divalent cation concentration
(4 mm ca*+
and 6 mm mg*‘) to prevent interictal discharges. indeed,
an acsf containing a high divalent cation concentration
depresses paroxystic activity and polysynaptic
discharges
( ben-ari and gho 1988; miles and wong 1986); this is
presumably due to a decrease of membrane excitability. in
these conditions,  xxxd1868xxx  (600 pm, 10 min) increased
significantly the slope (24 t 5%, /i = 15, p < 0.002), the
amplitude (32 t 5%, yi = 15, p 5 o.oos), and the duration
(30 t 7%, n = 15, p 5 0.001) of the field epsps. these
effects washed out within 40-55 min after removal of the
drug. as in cal, the slope and the amplitude of the field
epsps, in ca3, reached their maximum values around 7
min (7 t 0.5 and 6.9 t 0.6 min, respectively)
from the
onset of  xxxd1868xxx  application, whereas around 13 min are
required to obtain a maximum effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on the

duration of the field epsps (as shown in fig. 9, which surnmarizes the different effects of  xxxd1868xxx ).
the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on the slope, the amplitude, and
the duration of the ca1 and ca3 field epsps were dose
dependent (fig. 2). in ca3, the dose-response studies were
made in presence of acsf containing a high divalent cation concentration
(4 mm ca*+ and 6 mm mg*+) to prevent interictal discharges (ben-ai-i and gho 1988; miles
and wong 1986). the dose-response
curves were constructed, in ca1 as in ca3, by plotting the percentage values of the slope, the amplitude, and the duration against the
respective  xxxd1868xxx  concentrations
(200-600 pm). ec,,
values for the three parameters measured in ca1 and ca3
field epsps were calculated from the straight line that
showed the best fit with the middle portion of each concentration-response
curve. reported ec,, values are means of
values calculated from each experiment. in ca 1, ecso were
221 +2pm(~~=5)fortheslope,252.25*28~.~m(n=5)
for the amplitude, and 241.25 t 14 pm (n = 5) for the
duration. in ca3, ec& were 232.5 t 7.5 pm (n = 5) for the
slope, 240 t 10 pm (n = 5) for the amplitude, and 229 t 10
pm (n = 5) for the duration. application of  xxxd2215xxx

did not reduce the effects of 250-300 ,um  xxxd1868xxx  in ca 1
and in ca3. in addition, in control conditions, neither  xxxd2215xxx  nor  xxxd3394xxx 
modified the ca1 or ca3
field epsps. bath application of galanin ( 1 ,um) did not
reproduce the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  and had no effects on the
ca1 or ca3 field epsps.

effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on the excitatory and inhibitory
pktsynbptic potentials in ca3 pyramidal cells
in extracellular recordings, we observed that  xxxd1868xxx 
enhanced the field epsps and generated paroxysmal activities in ca3. these effects of  xxxd1868xxx , in ca3, are reminiscent of those generated by other convulsant agents, such as
kainate or bicuculline (ben-ari and gho 1988; fisher and
alger 1984; rovira et al. 1990), and may be due to an
increase of the glutamatergic synaptic excitation and/or to
a decrease of gabaergic
synaptic inhibition.
we have,
therefore, examined the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on evoked
epsps and inhibitory
postsynaptic
potentials (ipsps) in
ca3 pyramidal cells.
in ca3 pyramidal cells,
 xxxd1868xxx 
increased
the epsps.
the epsps evoked by the stimulation of the associational
commissural

microelectrodes
in presence of bicuculline ( 10 pm) and

phaclofen (50 pm), which specifically
block the fast
(gaba-a)
and the slow (gaba-b)
ipsps, respectively.
the acsf was modified (acsf containing 1.75 mm k’, 4
mm ca2+, and 6 mm mg2+) to prevent burst activities
otherwise recorded in presence of bicuculline ( ben-ari and
gho 1988). as shown in fig. 3 a, in these conditions, bath
application of 600 pm  xxxd1868xxx , for 10 min, increased significantly the amplitude of the epsps by 53 t 4% (n = 5;
p 5 0.0002), without significant changes of the input resistance of the cells (55 t 5 and 60 t 4 ma before and during
application of  xxxd1868xxx , respectively; n = 5 and p 5 0.48)
or membrane potential. the changes of the epsps were
also not associated with significant modification of the apparent reversal potential of the epsps (fig. 3 b). the reversal potential of the epsps was - 11 t 4.4 and - 13 t 1 mv
before and during bath application of 600 pm  xxxd1868xxx ,
respectively (n = 5; p 5 0.28). the increase of the amplitude of the epsps by  xxxd1868xxx  was associated with an increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission
measured by
means of amplitude of epsps-stimulus
intensity curves
(fig. 3c), demonstrating
that  xxxd1868xxx  acted at the synaptic level and not on the commissural fibers (in keeping with
the absence of effects on the afferent volley). such data
were obtained by applying stimulations of different intensities before and during application of 600 pm  xxxd1868xxx .

in ca3 pyramidal cells,
the ipsps were recorded with 2 m kme,so,-filled
microelectrodes in presence of cnqx to block the fast epsps

stimulation of the hilus evoked a biphasic tpsp with a fast
component (gaba-a

slow component (gaba-b
type), which reached full amplitude after 200 ms. bath application of 600 pm  xxxd1868xxx ,

the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on epsps and on fast and slow
ipsps could result from a modulation,
at the presynaptic
level, of the neurotransmitter
release or from a modulation
of the postsynaptic
responses. using the single electrode
voltage-clamp technique, we therefore examined the effects
of  xxxd1868xxx  on currents mediated by exogenous application of glutamatergic
( xxxd3068xxx ,
ampa, kainate, and
nmda) or gabaergic amino acid analogues (gaba, isoguvacine, and baclofen).
these experiments
were performed in ca3 pyramidal cells in presence of 1 pm ttx to

discussion

our observations show that  xxxd1868xxx  enhances the
epsps (recorded in presence of bicuculline and phaclofen)
and reduces the fast and slow ipsps (recorded in presence
of cnqx), without significant changes of their apparent
reversal potentials. these effects are not associated with a
change of the input resistance and membrane potentials.
furthermore, in presence of ttx, the currents generated
by ampa and nmda were enhanced, whereas those generated by gaba-a and gaba-b agonists were reduced,
the net consequence of these actions being an increase in
the excitatory drive and a reduction of the inhibitory responses, thus leading to interictal activities in the vulnerable ca3 region. the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  are dose dependent
and are neither antagonized by k,,, channel blockers such
as  xxxd2215xxx 
or  xxxd3394xxx 
nor mimicked
by katp
channel openers such as galanine, suggesting that there are
not mediated by k,,, channels. in fact, the absence of effect on the i- vcurves and membrane potential suggests that
these effects are unlikely to be due to a modulation of k+
channels and that conventional
k,,, channels are not
prominent in these pyramidal cells. furthermore, experiments performed on hippocampal neurons grown in cultures and recorded using the patch-clamp technique (whole
cell configuration) with microelectrodes containing cs+ (a
nonselective  xxxg1232xxx  blocker), have shown that
currents evoked by local applications of nmda are reversibly potentiated by  xxxd1868xxx  (v. crepel, i. medina, p. bregestovski and y. ben-ari, in preparation) ; thus these experiments provide further evidence that the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  are probably not mediated by k+ channels.
how could a such multiplicitv
of effects be generated on

pyramidal neurons? we cannot exclude a presynaptic effect
of  xxxd1868xxx  that could enhance the release of glutamate
and thus increase the epsps; however, the observations
showing that  xxxd1868xxx  also enhanced the currents generated by bath application of ampa and nmda
suggested
that the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on ampa- and nmda-mediated current were likely due to a direct postsynaptic effect
of  xxxd1868xxx  on ampa and nmda receptors. yamada and
rothman reported, in abstract form ( 199 1 ), that  xxxd1868xxx 
increased the steady-state currents mediated by  xxxd3068xxx 
and glutamate applications in hippocampal neurons grown
in culture; these effects of  xxxd1868xxx  were neither mimicked
by other  xxxg1253xxx  openers nor blocked by k,,, thannel blockers. interestingly,
we found that  xxxd1868xxx  enhanced the ampa- and nmda-mediated
currents and not
those generated by kainate application; because it has been
shown that the ampa and nmda receptors desensitize, in
contrast to the kainate receptors (mayer and vyklicky
1989; trussell et al. 1988), these results raise the possibility
that  xxxd1868xxx  alters the mechanisms responsible for desenzitisation of ampa and nmda
currents. an activity of
 xxxd1868xxx  through second-messenger
cascades may also
be suggested because excitatory
amino acid-mediated
currents are known to be regulated by proteins kinase cascade and second messengers. thus  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)dependent
protein
kinase a (pka)
upregulates
the
ampa-mediated currents (greengard et al. -i991 ), and the
ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase c
(pkc) upregulated the nmda-mediated
currents (aniksztejn et al. 1992; ben-ari et al. 1992; chen and huang
199 1). in the pancreatic &cells. it has been shown that
 xxxd1868xxx  requires for its activity ‘hydrolizable atp or mgatp, suggestingan involvement of protein kinase activities
(dunne 1989; kozlowski et al. 1989). thus, in pyramidal
neurons of the hippocampus,  xxxd1868xxx  may also act on
ampa- and nmda-mediated currents through the modulation of protein kinase activities. a similar type of inechanism could explain the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on the inhibitory responses. indeed, gaba-a (sigel and baur 1988)
and gaba-b (taniyama et al. 1992) receptors are negatively modulated by pkc; then  xxxd1868xxx  may reduce both
gaba-a and gaba-b by acting on pkc. recently, it has
been shown that another  xxxg1253xxx  opener, brl 38227,
has a direct action on intracellular calcium stores (chopra
et al. 1992). because nmda currents are potentiated by a
rise in [ ca2+li (markram and segal 1992), whereas gabaa currents are depressed( marchenko 199 1; mouginot et al.
1991);  xxxd1868xxx , like other ka-rp channel openers, may in
fact have a multiplicity of effects through [ ca2+li and intracellular second-messenger cascades. in keeping with this
hypothesis, the effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on the excitatory responseswere faster than those on the inhibitory responses,
suggestingthat  xxxd1868xxx  modulates the excitatory and inhibitory responsesthrough different mechanisms.
in conclusion, in ca3 hippocampal neurons,  xxxd1868xxx 
increasesthe glutamatergic currents and decreasesthe gabaergic currents and thus generates interictal activities.
the mechanisms by which  xxxd1868xxx  acts on these currents
remain to be elucidated. from the present findings and previous observations (ben-ari et al. 1990) in the hippocampus,  xxxd1868xxx  therefore has dual effects: 1) one is postsyni

and

aptic, in normal condition, which increases the excitatory
drive by modulating the excitatory and inhibitory currents;
and 2) others are presumably presynaptic, in anoxic condition, which decrease the excitatory drive by reducing the
anoxic depolarization
mediated by glutamate release (benari et al. 1990).
