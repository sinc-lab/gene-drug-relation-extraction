teroylglutamate ( xxxd3334xxx ) to form glycine and 5,10-methylene- xxxd3334xxx . in eukarya and eubacteria,  xxxd3334xxx  functions as a carrier of c1 units in several oxidation states, which
are used in the biosynthesis of important cellular components,
such as purines and thymidylate, in the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine or, in acetogenic bacteria, in the synthesis of acetyl-coa. the reaction catalyzed by shmt represents in these organisms one of the major loading routes of c1
units onto the folate carrier (1). in methanogens and several
other archaea, c1 fragments from formyl to methyl oxidation
levels are carried by tetrahydromethanopterin (h4mpt), a
pterin-containing compound involved in methanogenesis. although  xxxd3334xxx  and h4mpt are structurally similar in their
pterin-like portion (fig. 1) and in the role as c1 units carriers,
they are functionally distinct. h4mpt does not appear to be
suited to most of the biosynthetic functions of  xxxd3334xxx . moreover, the biosynthetic pathways of the two carriers have few, if
any, homologies, suggesting the possibility of separate evolutionary origins (2). in the metabolism of folates, shmt represents a unique link between archaea and the rest of living
beings, in the sense that, whereas all shmts clearly share a
common evolutionary origin (3), other enzymes that use
h4mpt as cofactor do not show any significant homology to
their eukaryotic and eubacterial counterparts (2).
although a gene encoding shmt is present in all archaeal
genomes so far sequenced, little information is available on the
catalytic properties and metabolic role of the enzyme in these
organisms. modified folates are not commercially available,
and this has clearly hindered a satisfactory characterization of
archaeal shmts. moreover, the purification of the enzyme
from archaea that thrive in extreme environments is complicated
by the difficulty of growing these organisms in a laboratory. two
reports of purified shmt activity, from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (4), recently renamed methanothermobacter marburgensis (5), and from sulfolobus solfataricus (6), with limited
structural and functional characterization, have been made. in the
first report, the enzyme was proposed to function in vivo in the
direction of serine biosynthesis. importantly, both works provided
evidence that shmt was selective toward the modified folate used
by the source organisms: h4mpt for m. marburgensis and sulfopterin for s. solfataricus (2, 7).
this study reports on the purification of recombinant shmt
from methanococcus jannaschii (mjshmt) and the characterization of its catalytic and thermodynamic properties. the aim
of the research was to assess the extent to which mjshmt is
structurally and mechanistically similar to its prokaryotic and
eukaryotic counterparts.

the reaction catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt), the transfer of c␤ of serine to  xxxd3334xxx , represents in eucarya and eubacteria a major source of one-carbon (c1) units for several
essential biosynthetic processes. in many archaea, c1
units are carried by modified pterin-containing compounds, which, although structurally related to  xxxd3334xxx , play a distinct functional role.
tetrahydromethanopterin, and a few variants of this
compound, are the modified folates of methanogenic
and sulfate-reducing archaea. little information on
shmt from archaea is available, and the metabolic role
of the enzyme in these organisms is not clear. this contribution reports on the purification and characterization of recombinant shmt from the hyperthermophilic
methanogen methanococcus jannaschii. the enzyme
was characterized with respect to its catalytic, spectroscopic, and thermodynamic properties. tetrahydromethanopterin was found to be the preferential pteridine substrate.  xxxd3334xxx  could also take part in
the hydroxymethyltransferase reaction, although with a
much lower efficiency. the catalytic features of the enzyme
with substrate analogues and in the absence of a pteridine
substrate were also very similar to those of shmt isolated
from eucarya or eubacteria. on the other hand, the m.
jannaschii enzyme showed increased thermoactivity and
resistance to denaturating agents with respect to the enzyme purified from mesophilic sources. the results reported suggest that the active site structure and the mechanism of shmt are conserved in the enzyme from m.
jannaschii, which appear to differ only in its ability to bind
and use a modified folate as substrate and increased thermal stability.

taining shmt, detected spectrophotometrically, pooled, and concentrated using centrifuge concentrators (30 kda cut-off; vivaspin,
sartorius) to a volume of about 20 ml, were heat-treated for 15 min at
75 °c to precipitate most of the host cell proteins. after centrifugation
at 15,000 ⫻ g for 30 min, the supernatant containing mjshmt and a
few other proteins was loaded onto a deae-sepharose column (3 ⫻ 10
cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph
7.2. the column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and the
protein was then eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0 – 0.4 m nacl
in 20 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.2. fractions were pooled and concentrated as in the previous step. the purity of the mjshmt sample was
checked by sds-page and judged to be ⱖ98%. the protein concentration was determined measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using a
⑀280 ⫽ 34990 m⫺1 cm⫺1, calculated according to ref. 10.
molecular mass estimation by size-exclusion chromatography—the
molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated by size-exclusion
chromatography at 20 °c on a superose 12 column (amersham biosciences), eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with 20 mm sodium
phosphate, ph 7.2, containing 0.15 m nacl, controlled by a dionex
pump. elution was monitored at 280 and 226 nm. the superose column
was calibrated with horse spleen  xxxg818xxx  (440 kda, elution volume
ve ⫽ 8.0 ml), catalase (232 kda, ve ⫽ 9.1 ml), rabbit muscle aldolase
(158 kda, ve ⫽ 9.3 ml), bsa (67 kda, ve ⫽ 9.8 ml), egg albumin (43 kda,
ve ⫽ 10.4 ml), chymotrypsin (25 kda, ve ⫽ 12 ml), and ribonuclease
(13.7 kda, ve ⫽ 12.5 ml). ve of the purified shmt was 9.6 ml.
molecular mass estimation by analytical ultracentrifugation—all
experiments were conducted at 20 °c on a beckman optima xl-a
analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. the protein
concentration was in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 mg/ml. sedimentation
velocity experiments were done at 40,000 rpm. data were collected at
280 nm at a spacing of 0.005 cm with three averages in a continuous
scan mode and were analyzed with the program sedfit (11). sedimentation coefficients were corrected to s20,w using standard procedures.
sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 16,000,
19,000 and 22,000 rpm. data were collected at 280 nm at a spacing of
0.001 cm with 10 averages in a step scan mode. establishment of
equilibrium was checked by comparing scans up to 24 h. data sets were
edited with reedit (j. lary, national analytical ultracentrifugation
center, storrs, ct) and fit with nonlin (pc version provided by
e. braswell, national analytical ultracentrifugation center, storrs,
ct) (12). data from different speeds were combined for global fitting.
fits to a single species give a z-average molecular weight. for fits to a
monomer-dimer association scheme, the monomer molecular weight
was fixed at the value determined from the amino acid sequence. the
experiments were performed in 20 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.2, and in
20 mm sodium formate, ph 3.0, containing 200 ␮m dtt and 100 ␮m
edta.
kinetic studies—with serine and h4mpt as substrates, the rate of
5,10-methylene-h4mpt production was determined by oxidizing this
compound to 5,10-methenyl-h4mpt, using nadp⫹ and methyleneh4mpt dehydrogenase from m. extorquens am1. the initial rate of the

experimental procedures

materials—ingredients for bacterial growth were from difco. chemicals used in the purification procedure were from  xxxg257xxx , and deaesepharose and phenyl-sepharose were from amersham biosciences.
enzymes used for the cloning procedures were purchased from roche
diagnostics. shmt from escherichia coli (eshmt) was expressed and
purified as described previously (8). the oligonucleotides used in the
pcr reaction were from mwg biotech. (6s)- xxxd3334xxx  was a gift from
a. g. eprova, schaffhausen, switzerland. all other reagents were from
sigma-aldrich. the bifunctional enzyme methylene- xxxd3334xxx  dehydrogenase/methenyl- xxxd3334xxx  cyclohydrolase from e. coli was purified
from a recombinant e. coli bacterial strain kindly provided by dr.
martino di salvo (università “la sapienza,” rome, italy) following the
procedure described previously (9). nadp-dependent methyleneh4mpt dehydrogenase from methylobacterium extorquens am1 and
h4mpt purified from m. marburgensis were kindly provided by rolf
thauer (max-planck-institut für terrestrische mikrobiologie, marburg,
germany). the thermostable  xxxg110xxx  from thermoanaerobium brockii employed in the  xxxg2069xxx  assay was from
sigma-aldrich.
cloning of the  xxxg2069xxx  gene from m. jannaschii—a puc18 plasmid with
a 1686-bp insert containing the gene encoding mjshmt was purchased
from the american type culture collection. this plasmid (amjk15)
was used as template in a pcr amplification that used 5⬘-gggatacatatggaatattcgg-3⬘ (upstream) and 5⬘-gcgaattcttaatagaatcttag-3⬘ (downstream) oligonucleotides as primers. ndei and
ecori restriction sites were introduced in the primers to insert the
amplified 1287-bp dna fragment into a pet22b expression plasmid
(novagen), which was used to transform e. coli hms174 (de3) cells
(novagen). the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined to
confirm that no mismatching had occurred during the pcr
amplification.
expression and purification—a 100-ml overnight culture of e. coli
hms174 (de3) cells, transformed with the mjshmt overexpressing
plasmid, was inoculated into 3 liters of luria-bertani broth containing
ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and grown aerobically at 37 °c to exponential
phase (a600 ⫽ 0.3– 0.4). expression of mjshmt was then induced with
0.2 mm isopropyl thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside. after 20 h, cells were
harvested and suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm tris/hcl, 1 mm edta, ph
7.6. cell lysis was obtained by the addition of 1 mg of lysozyme per g of
packed bacterial cells. after incubation at 25 °c for 30 min, the cells
were frozen overnight at ⫺20 °c. after thawing, streptomycin sulfate
(10 g/liter) was added to precipitate dna. the cell extract was then
centrifuged at 15,000 ⫻ g for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded. solid
ammonium sulfate was added to the yellow supernatant to 60% saturation. the solution was centrifuged at 15,000 ⫻ g for 20 min, and the
pellet was discarded. the supernatant was directly loaded onto a phenyl-sepharose column (5 ⫻ 15 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2, containing ammonium sulfate to 30%
saturation. the column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and
the protein was eluted using a 600-ml linear gradient from the equilibrating buffer to 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.2. fractions con-

denaturant dependence of each basis spectrum. both u and v columns
are arranged in terms of their decreasing order of the relative weight of
information, as indicated by the magnitude of the singular values in s.
the diagonal s matrix contains the singular values that quantify the
relative importance of each vector in u and v. an important feature of
svd analysis is that the signal-to-noise ratio is very high in the earliest
columns of u and v, and the random noise is mainly accumulated in the
latest u and v columns. the wavelength averaged spectral changes
induced by increasing denaturant concentrations are represented by
the columns of matrix v. therefore, the plot of the columns of v versus
the denaturant concentration provides information about the observed
transition.
urea-induced equilibrium unfolding was analyzed by fitting baseline
and transition region data to a two-state linear extrapolation model (20)
according to equation 1, where ⌬gunfolding is the free energy change of
unfolding for a given denaturant concentration, ⌬gh2o is the free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, and m is a slope
term that quantitates the change in ⌬gunfolding per unit concentration of
denaturant, r is the gas constant, t is the absolute temperature, and
kunfolding is the equilibrium constant for unfolding.

results

purification of mjshmt and molecular mass estimation—
purification was performed on 15-g portions of wet bacterial
cell paste deriving from 2 liters of culture. a 20-fold purification of the enzyme with a yield of 10 mg per liter of culture was
obtained. the purified enzyme exhibited a single band on sdspage when stained with coomassie blue and, on analytical
ultracentrifugation, sedimented as a single, sharp, and symmetrical peak (see below). mjshmt, whose predicted subunit
size based on the amino acid sequence is 48.2 kda, eluted in 20
mm sodium phosphate, ph 7.2, from a calibrated size-exclusion
chromatography column (superose 12) with an elution volume
corresponding to a protein of 98 kda, suggesting that the enzyme is a dimer at neutral ph.
catalytic properties of mjshmt—the shmt activity of the
enzyme was assayed at 37 °c, using either h4mpt or
 xxxd3334xxx  as pteridine substrate. such a sub-optimal temperature was required by the use of methylene-h4mpt dehydrogenase from m. extorquens am1 as the coupling enzyme in the
assay. activity, which was measured upon mixing 0.1 ␮m enzyme with 4 mm l-serine and 50 ␮m of either pteridine substrates, could only be detected when using h4mpt. the dependence of the steady-state rate of the reaction on substrates
concentration conformed to the michaelis-menten equation,
with best fit values of kinetic parameters as summarized in
table i. the addition of 20 mm magnesium acetate to the
reaction mixture did not increase activity, differently from that
reported for the enzyme from m. marburgensis (4). the same
experiment was repeated under anaerobic conditions, obtaining similar values for the kinetic parameters, and showing
that, interestingly, the reaction is not negatively affected by
oxygen.

cm⫺1 (13). the same procedure was employed when  xxxd3334xxx  was
the pteridine substrate, except that the coupled enzyme employed in the
assay was the bifunctional methylene- xxxd3334xxx  dehydrogenase/methenyl- xxxd3334xxx  cyclohydrolase from e. coli, and the ⑀340 used in the
calculation was 7200 m⫺1 cm⫺1 (8). the reaction mixture included
mjshmt at either 0.1 ␮m, when h4mpt was the pteridine substrate, or
14 ␮m, when  xxxd3334xxx  was used. kinetic parameters were determined
either under anaerobic conditions (n2 pressure equal to 0.3 bar) or in
the presence of air, varying the concentration of one substrate while the
second was kept constant. the dependence of the initial velocity of the
reaction on h4mpt concentration was determined maintaining l-serine
at 30 mm and varying  xxxd3334xxx  concentration between 0.162 and 0.45
mm. h4mpt was 0.162 mm when serine was varied between 0.09 and 30
mm. the formaldehyde was measured mixing aliquots of the reaction
mixture, taken at time intervals, with an equal volume of 0.2% (w/v)
2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine in 1 m hcl. the resulting colored solution
was diluted in 1 m hcl and used to measure the increase in absorbance
at 380 nm because of the formation of a dinitrophenyl hydrazone derivative. for this derivative, a calibration curve, obtained previously
using commercial formaldehyde, gave a ⑀380 ⫽ 57120 m⫺1 cm⫺1.
retroaldol cleavage reactions were carried out in 20 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 7.2. the rate of allo-threonine cleavage was measured by
coupling the reaction with reduction of the product acetaldehyde by
nadh and thermostable  xxxg110xxx  from t. brockii (14).
the rate of the reaction was calculated from the rate of decrease in
absorbance at 340 nm, using a value of ⑀340 ⫽ 6220 m⫺1 cm⫺1. benzaldehyde production from phenylserine cleavage was measured spectrophotometrically at 279 nm, using a molar absorptivity value of ⑀279 ⫽
1400 m⫺1 cm⫺1 (15). the rate of transamination with both alanine
enantiomers was determined according to ref. 16. kinetic data analysis, curve-fitting procedures, and statistical analysis were performed
using the data manipulation software of scientist (micromath, salt
lake city, ut).
spectroscopic techniques—fluorescence emission measurements
were carried out at 20 °c with a ls50b spectrofluorimeter
(perkinelmer life sciences) using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette.
intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 – 450
nm (1-nm sampling interval) with the excitation wavelength set at 295
nm. plp emission fluorescence was monitored between 330 and 600 nm
exciting at 285, 320, and 418 nm.
cd spectra were recorded at 20 °c in a jasco j-720 spectropolarimeter. far-uv-cd spectra (190 –250 nm) were measured in a 0.1-cm path
length quartz cuvette, and near-uv-cd spectra (250 –310 nm) and
visible-cd spectra (310 –500 nm) were measured in a 1.0-cm path
length quartz cuvette. the results are expressed as the mean residue
ellipticity ([⌰]) assuming a mean residue weight of 110 da per amino
acid residue. in all the spectroscopic measurements, 200 ␮m dtt and
100 ␮m edta were added unless otherwise stated. uv-visible spectra
were recorded with a double-beam lambda 16 perkinelmer life sciences spectrometer equipped with a peltier thermocontroller set at
20 °c.
urea-induced unfolding equilibrium—protein samples, at 0.12
mg/ml final concentration, were incubated at 20 °c with increasing
concentrations of urea (0 –7.9 m) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7.2, or
in 20 mm sodium formate, ph 3.0, in the presence of 200 ␮m dtt and
100 ␮m edta. after 24 h, a time that was tested to be sufficient to reach
equilibrium, far-uv-cd spectra were recorded at 20 °c. to probe the
reversibility of the unfolding process, the protein (1.9 mg/ml) was incubated at 20 °c with 7.9 m urea in 20 mm formate, ph 3.0, in the presence
of 3.2 mm dtt and 1.6 mm edta. after 24 h, the refolding was started
by a 16-fold dilution with the same buffer used for the unfolding,
containing decreasing denaturant concentrations. the final protein concentration was 0.12 mg/ml. after 2 h, a time that was established to be
sufficient to reach equilibrium, far-uv-cd spectra were recorded at
20 °c.
data analysis—far-uv-cd spectra from urea titration were analyzed by the singular value decomposition algorithm (svd) (17–19)
using the software matlab (mathworks, south natick, ma). svd is
useful to find the number of independent components in a set of spectra
and to remove the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random
error. cd spectra in the 210 –250-nm region (0.2-nm sampling interval)
were placed in a rectangular matrix a of n columns, one column for each
spectrum collected in the titration. the a matrix is decomposed by svd
into the product of three matrices: a ⫽ u*s*vt, where u and v are
orthogonal matrices, and s is a diagonal matrix. the columns of u
matrix contain the basis spectra, and those of the v matrix contain the

 xxxd3334xxx , but only if the enzyme was present in the assay at a
much higher concentration (14 ␮m). in this case, the dependence of the steady-state velocity on the pteridine substrate was
linear on a range from 0 to 150 ␮m. higher  xxxd3334xxx  concentrations could not be employed without incurring problems
with the assay. activity did not change significantly when
measured under anaerobic conditions. the specificity constant
with  xxxd3334xxx  could be calculated, because the observed linear
relationship between substrate concentration and initial velocity is evidence that under the conditions of the assay km⬎⬎ [s],
and therefore the michaelis-menten equation can be reduced to
v0 ⫽ kcat/km䡠[e0]䡠[s].  xxxd3334xxx  is known to react spontaneously with formaldehyde (21). therefore, there was a possibility that the shmt reaction we observed with  xxxd3334xxx  was
actually because of the retroaldol cleavage of serine, followed
by the spontaneous condensation between the product formaldehyde and the folate to form 5,10-methylene- xxxd3334xxx . to
check this hypothesis, we repeated the experiment under the
same conditions but in the absence of  xxxd3334xxx . no formaldehyde could be detected, confirming that the shmt reaction
involving  xxxd3334xxx  takes place on the enzyme. the actual
binding of  xxxd3334xxx  to the enzyme was also demonstrated by
the appearance of a typical 490-nm absorbing band, corresponding to a quinonoid intermediate (22), upon mixing 0.2 mm
 xxxd3334xxx  with 230 ␮m enzyme and 70 mm glycine at 37 °c in 20
mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.2. analogously, a quinonoid
intermediate was visible after mixing 0.135 mm h4mpt with
14 ␮m enzyme and 70 mm glycine (data not shown).
the enzyme was also capable of catalyzing the retroaldol
cleavage of l-allo-threonine and threo-␤-phenylserine to glycine and the corresponding aldehyde (table i). addition of 200
mm of either l- or d-alanine to the enzyme resulted in a
transamination reaction, as indicated by the decrease of absorbance at 424 nm and the concomitant formation of a new
absorption band with a maximum at 324 nm. the 498-nm
absorbing band, corresponding to a quinonoid intermediate,
which is observed with the e. coli enzyme (16), is absent in the
reaction catalyzed by mjshmt. the kinetics of both reactions,
which were carried out at 60 °c, fitted well to the sum of two
first-order processes. with d-alanine, the rapid phase exhibited
a k ⫽ 0.42 min⫺1 and was responsible for about 3⁄4 of the total
absorbance change, whereas the slow phase had a k ⫽ 0.054
min⫺1. with l-alanine, the fast phase corresponded to a k ⫽
0.092 min⫺1 and 1⁄3 of the total amplitude; the slow phase had
a k ⫽ 0.001 min⫺1. although eshmt transaminates both alanine enantiomers with single first order kinetics, the reaction
of d-alanine is also faster with this enzyme (k is 0.038 min⫺1
with d-alanine and 0.014 min⫺1 with l-alanine).

activity of mjshmt (triangles) and eshmt (circles) in the retroaldol

steady-state velocity of the reaction was measured either under virtually saturating conditions (25 mm substrate; closed symbols) or at about
4% of saturation (0.055 mm substrate; open symbols). measurements

ture dependence of the rate of retroaldol cleavage of l-allothreonine was determined, using either eshmt or mjshmt as
catalyst, over the range from 25 to 85 °c (fig. 2a). the steadystate velocity of the reaction was measured both under virtually saturating conditions (25 mm substrate) and at about 4% of
saturation (0.055 mm substrate). the reaction catalyzed by
mjshmt was found to have an optimal temperature 20 –25 °c
higher than that catalyzed by the e. coli enzyme. saturation
with the substrate had a stabilizing effect on the activity of
both enzymes. data were used in a global fit to the arrhenius
equation in which the activation energy (estimated to be equal
to 70.00 ⫾ 2.10 kj/mol) was a shared parameter (fig. 2b).
urea-induced unfolding equilibrium—the equilibrium stability of mjshmt was studied by monitoring urea-induced
unfolding transitions. at neutral ph, in the presence of 10 m

serine hydroxymethyltransferase from methanococcus jannaschii

urea, 42% residual ellipticity at 222 nm was still present after
24 h at 20 °c, thus indicating that the enzyme structure was
not abolished (data not shown). no further changes were observed after 48 h. these results prompted us to explore the
effect of urea at acidic ph, with the aim of finding the conditions required for complete and reversible unfolding transitions. at ph 3.0 a single monomeric species is present, as
indicated by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, with a
secondary structure content similar to that of the enzyme at ph
7.2 (see below). these observations encouraged us to analyze
the effect of urea on mjshmt at ph 3.0. increasing urea
concentrations (0 –10 m) induced structural changes on the
enzyme, as revealed by far-uv-cd spectra, and above 6 m the
dichroic activity was reduced significantly with a transition
midpoint at 2.56 m (fig. 3). the process was completely reversible, as indicated by the recovery of the dichroic activity after
dilution of the denaturant, with ⌬g and m values corresponding to 13.43 kj/mol and 5.23 kj/mol/m, respectively. the ellipticity changes at 222 nm induced by increasing concentrations
of urea were analyzed after removal of the high-frequency noise
and the low-frequency random error by svd. the global
changes in the spectral region from 210 to 250 nm were analyzed by svd, which indicates that only two spectral components contribute to the far-uv-cd spectra. the most significant singular values are 1.7 ⫻ 105, 0.2 ⫻ 105, and 0.03 ⫻ 105.
all the other singular values are well below 10% of the largest
singular value and progressively decrease approaching to zero.
a plot of the first and the second columns of the v matrix (v1
and v2) as a function of urea concentration (data not shown)
shows transition profiles comparable with those observed by
monitoring the 222-nm ellipticity changes.
spectroscopic and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses—
the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary arrangement of the
enzyme at ph 7.2 was investigated and compared with that at
ph 3.0, with the aim of detecting possible structural changes
caused by the low ph necessary to reversibly denature the
enzyme. the far-uv-cd spectrum at ph 7.2 is typical of a
predominantly ␣-helix protein (fig. 4a). at ph 3.0, the faruv-cd spectrum of the holoenzyme is characterized by a profile similar to that at ph 7.2 with the same zero intercept and

⌰222/⌰208 ratio and a slight general decrease of ellipticity compared with that at neutral ph (fig. 4a). in the near-uv region,
the dichroic activity of the enzyme at ph 3.0 is notably decreased in comparison with the enzyme at ph 7.2, and the
289-nm trp band is absent (fig. 4b). at ph 3.0, the 420- and
325-nm bands, present in the uv-visible cd spectrum of the
holoenzyme at neutral ph and attributable to the plp cofactor,
are absent (fig. 4c). the uv-visible absorption spectrum at ph
3.0 shows a 3-fold decrease of the absorbance at 420 nm, when
compared with that of the holoenzyme at ph 7.2 (fig. 4d).
the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of the holoenzyme at ph 7.2 and 3.0, measured upon excitation at 295 nm,
are similar and show the same maximum emission wavelength
at 347 nm (fig. 4e). at ph 7.2, as observed with other plp
enzymes in the holo-form (23–25), excitation at either 320 or
418 nm yields fluorescence emission spectra with maxima centered, respectively, at 386 nm and 494 nm (fig. 5, a and b). a
faint energy transfer band at about 510 nm is observed when
exciting at 285 nm (fig. 5a, inset). at ph 3.0, the fluorescence
emission spectra of the holoenzyme (fig. 5, a and b) excited at
320 and 418 nm are centered at the same maximum emission
wavelength, although a dramatic decrease of the relative fluorescence is observed upon excitation at 418 nm. at ph 3.0, the
510-nm energy transfer band is absent (fig. 5a, inset).
the relative content of the secondary structure elements in
solution, estimated by selcon 2 (26) using the software dicroprot v2.5 on the far-uv-cd spectra, at ph 7.2 and 3.0,
was at least 98% and corresponded to 36 and 28% ␣⫺helix, 14
and 18% ␤-sheet, 22 and 24% turns, 8% polyproline ii, and 20%
of other structures, respectively. the relative amount of ␣ and
␤ structures was also consistent with that determined by k2d
program (27) and selcon 3 (28). these results indicate that
at ph 3.0 the shmt relative secondary structure composition
is closely similar to that at ph 7.2. secondary structure prediction according to ref. 29 indicates 50% ␣-helix, 16% extended, and 34% loops.
the spectral properties of the monomer at ph 3.0 indicate
that the dissociation of the dimer into monomers is accompanied by remarkable changes of the tertiary contacts, as indicated by the near-uv and visible cd signals, and suggest that
the secondary structure content of the monomer is similar to
that of the dimeric enzyme.
sedimentation velocity experiments yielded an s20,w value of
6.2 for the enzyme at ph 7.0 and 3.9 – 4.3 at ph 3.0. such values
correspond to molecular masses of 100 kda and 50 –55 kda,
respectively, for proteins with a spherical shape (30). equilibrium sedimentation experiments confirmed such results, yielding molecular mass values of 53 ⫾ 4 kda at ph 3.0 and 80 ⫾ 10
kda at ph 7.2, when data were fitted to a single species. a very
poor fit was obtained for a monomer-dimer association-dissociation scheme at both ph values. taken together, the performed
analyses strongly indicate that the protein is mainly dimeric at
neutral ph and dissociates almost entirely into monomers at
ph 3.0.
discussion

shmt has been isolated from several sources and extensively characterized, from both the structural and functional
points of view (31). crystal structures of the enzyme from five
different eubacterial and eukaryotic sources, either in the unliganded form or in complex with amino substrates and
 xxxd3334xxx  analogues, have been solved (32–36). therefore, a
clear picture of the amino acid residues which form the active
site and are involved in cofactor and substrate binding is available. a recent, theoretical analysis on the structural features of
archaeal shmts proposed that the environment of the plp
cofactor in these enzymes exhibits no significant differences

with respect to their bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts (3).
shmt is characterized by very broad reaction and substrate
specificities. in addition to its physiological hydroxymethyltransferase activity, this enzyme is able to catalyze, in the
absence of the pteridine substrate, a number of different reactions such as the reatroaldol cleavage of ␤-hydroxyamino acids
and the transamination of both alanine enantiomers (31). our
results show that the catalytic properties of mjshmt match
those of the enzyme purified from other sources and therefore
confirm that the plp catalytic apparatus of shmt is substantially conserved throughout the kingdoms. a multiple sequence
alignment of eubacterial and archaeal shmts (the numbering
system is based on the amino acid sequence of eshmt) shows

indeed that all residues interacting with plp are invariant
(fig. 6): his126 and ala202, the residues that stack, respectively,
to the re face and si face of plp, his129 and asn102, which
appear to stabilize the crucial interaction between asp200 and
the pyridinium nitrogen of plp, and his203 and ser 175, which
interact with the phenol oxygen of plp pyridine ring. the
residues involved in the binding of the amino acid substrates
are also invariant: glu57, and tyr65, (the apostrophe indicates
that the residues are contributed from the other subunit),
which appear to interact with the hydroxyl group of the plpbound serine substrate, and arg363 and ser35, which bind to the
␣-carboxylate of the substrates. on the other hand, the selectivity of mjshmt toward h4mpt reflects the presence of a

serine hydroxymethyltransferase from methanococcus jannaschii

specific binding site of the pteridine substrate and clearly represents a distinguishing feature. interestingly,  xxxd3334xxx  can
also bind to mjshmt and take part to the hydroxymethyltransferase reaction, although 450-fold less efficiently than h4mpt.
this suggests that significant differences between h4mpt-dependent and  xxxd3334xxx -dependent shmts may be limited to
only the pteridine binding site. crystallographic studies have
shown that the pteridine substrate binds to the enzyme from
different eubacterial and eukaryotic sources with similar modalities, although the stoichiometry and subunit occupancy for

the binding is different for each of the four structures solved so
far (34, 35, 36, 38). asn347, which binds to n-1 and n-8 of
 xxxd3334xxx , is probably the most important structural element
in the pteridine ring recognition. another important interaction is made by tyr64, which stacks to the p-aminobenzoic acid
ring of  xxxd3334xxx . other interactions are made by the backbone
carbonyls of residues 121, 125, and 127. the portion of the
active site that binds the pteridine ring, i.e. the moiety of the
molecule that is similar in all different pteridine substrates, is
expected to be structurally similar in all shmts. asn347 is
indeed an invariant residue (fig. 6). tyr64 is present in all
aligned sequences except those corresponding to shmt from
methanogens, which have a leu residue at this position. however, this difference does not seem to be related to the nature of
the pteridine substrate, because pyrococcus shmts use a modified folate whose pteridine ring is identical to that of h4mpt
(2). identification of the residues responsible for the pteridine
substrate specificity is actually difficult. apparent differences
in the primary structure of shmts from methanogens that use
h4mpt (note that methanosarcina shmt is an exception in
methanogens, because it is  xxxd3334xxx -dependent (39)) with respect to the eubacterial and eukaryotic enzymes (fig. 6) may be
related to the particular phylogenetic history of these organisms, rather than to a specific function. moreover, the available
structures of shmt in complex with  xxxd3334xxx  derivatives do
not give any clue of how the distinctive portion of the pteridine
substrates may bind to the enzyme, and modeling studies did
not locate structural elements involved in this specific binding
(3).
m. jannaschii is an obligate anaerobe and therefore it is
expected that oxygen might affect the hydroxymethyltransferase reaction catalyzed by mjshmt. we tested the effect of
oxygen by performing kinetic studies under both aerobic and
anaerobic conditions and using either h4mpt or  xxxd3334xxx  as
pteridine substrate. surprisingly, the presence of oxygen does
not seem to affect significantly the kinetic parameters of the
reaction.
the temperature dependence of the enzyme activity in the
allo- xxxg2069xxx  reaction shows that with either
mjshmt or eshmt the saturation with substrate has a stabilizing effect (fig. 2a). this is in agreement with previously
reported studies on the interactions of substrates and substrate
analogues with cytosolic rabbit shmt, which suggested that
the binding of ␤-hydroxyamino acids results in a conformational change of the enzyme (40). the activation energy of the
allo- xxxg2069xxx  reaction calculated from the arrhenius
plots appears to be the same for both enzymes. taken together,
these results confirm that mjshmt is quite similar in several
respects to the enzyme from mesophilic sources.
notably, mjshmt is fairly resistant to denaturation. at ph
3.0, the protein shows a global secondary structure content
similar to the native dimeric form with a significant perturbation of the tertiary structure, as revealed by the near-uv and
visible cd spectra and the plp fluorescence emission spectrum, accompanied by loss of the dimeric assembly. this finding may indicate that electrostatic interactions play a significant role in the stabilization of the dimer. the ⌬g of the
monomer secondary structure unfolding is below the lowest
limit reported for many globular proteins from mesophiles,
whereas the transition midpoint is at 2.56 m denaturant, a
value similar to that reported for the dimeric e. coli enzyme at
neutral ph (41). this fact indicates that the monomeric protein
can tolerate high concentrations of denaturant without showing a remarkable conformational stability at 20 °c. interestingly, the notable resistance of the enzyme against urea-induced denaturation is shown by the persistence of a significant

amount of secondary structure in the presence of 10 m urea at
ph 7.2. therefore, the monomeric state of mjshmt at ph 3.0
should be considered a protein resistant against urea-induced
denaturation rather than a stable protein (42).
a recent structural comparison between shmt from mesophilic and thermophilic sources, carried out through the application of homology modeling, indicated that the thermal stability in shmt may be the result of the combination of an
increased number of charged residues at the protein surface
and an increased hydrophobicity at the protein core (3). the
experimental results obtained with mjshmt agree with these
hypotheses.
