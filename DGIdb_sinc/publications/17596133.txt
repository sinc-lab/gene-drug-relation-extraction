summary. background: the eﬃcacy of oral anticoagulant
therapy is largely conditioned by both environmental and
genetic factors. objectives: to attempt to deﬁne the genetic
proﬁle involved in the response to this treatment. patients and
methods: we selected 100 men younger than 75 years, with nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation, who started anticoagulation with
 xxxd59xxx  following the same protocol: 3 mg for three
consecutive days. then, doses were individually adjusted to
achieve a steady international normalized ratio (inr). the
basal plasma level and the level after 3 days were obtained, and
the inr was determined. we studied ﬁve functional polymorphisms: fvii –323 del/ins, cyp2c*9,  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t,
calumenin (calu) r4q and calu a29809g. the dose
required for a steady inr was also recorded. results:only
the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype had signiﬁcant impact on the eﬃcacy of
therapy. carriers of the 1173t allele were signiﬁcantly more
sensitive to therapy for 3 days [inr 2.07 (1.59–2.87) vs. 1.74
(1.30–2.09); p = 0.015] and they needed lower  xxxd59xxx 
doses
to
stabilize
their
inr
(15.8 ± 5.6
vs.
19.5 ± 6.0 mg week–1; p = 0.004). its eﬀect was exacerbated
by combination with the calu a29809g polymorphism.
carriers of both variants (27% of the sample) achieved the
highest inr [2.26 (1.70–3.32)] and required the lowest dose
(14.1 ± 5.1 mg week–1). this genetic proﬁle was particularly
relevant in patients with inr ‡ 3.5 at the start of therapy
(p = 0.005; odds ratio = 6.67, 95% conﬁdence interval =
1.32–37.43). conclusions:our results suggest that calu
a29809g might be a new genetic factor involved in the
pharmacogenetics of anticoagulant therapy, and conﬁrm that

 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins.
introduction
the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent c-carboxylation system ( xxxg2418xxx ) is a
multicomponent complex of proteins embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and involved in ccarboxylation, a relevant post-translational modiﬁcation of
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins. the c-glutamyl carboxylase
converts  xxxd2431xxx  residues within these proteins to
calcium-binding c-carboxyglutamic acid residues, in a process
in which reduced  xxxd3522xxx  is an essential cofactor.  xxxd3522xxx 
epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ), a recently identiﬁed 18-kda
protein, recycles the resulting oxidized  xxxd3522xxx  [1]. in the
blood coagulation system, seven hepatic proteins (prothrombin, factors vii, ix and x, and  xxxg1850xxx , c and z) are
dependent on c-carboxylation [2]. indeed, inhibition of
 xxxg2418xxx  activity by coumarin derivatives is the most
commonly used approach to anticoagulant therapy worldwide.
the binding site for coumarins in the oxidized thiol redox
center of  xxxg2418xxx  has been recently described [3]. as
expected, missense mutations in  xxxg2418xxx  have been associated with combined type 2 deﬁciency of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
clotting factors in humans and hereditary forms of warfarin
resistance in rats [4,5].
the individual response to oral anticoagulants is often
unpredictable, and in some cases, an inadequate response to
standard doses can lead to overanticoagulation and bleeding.
although the response to coumarins is known to depend on
several factors, such as age, sex, diet and concomitant drugs [6],
the development of pharmacogenetics has made it evident that
interindividual sensitivity to coumarins may be largely genetically determined [7]. allelic variants of cyp2c*9, a member of

1702 r. gonzález-conejero et al

the cytochrome p450 family involved in the metabolism of
coumarins, have been associated with decreased coumarin dose
requirements [8].  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms and haplotypes
have also been associated with coumarin required doses [8,9].
up to 35% of the variability in the dose requirements is
explained by the genetic variability of these proteins [9].
however, a high proportion of this variability in response to
coumarins remains unknown. new molecules and genetic
variants must be evaluated. an interesting candidate protein,
active in the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle, is the er chaperone ca2+binding protein calumenin (calu). calu has been
previously described as an inhibitor of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
c-carboxylation [10,11]. more recently, it has been shown that
small interfering rna silencing of calu in bhk cells leads
to the overexpression of  xxxg2418xxx  [12]. moreover, a single
polymorphism in the calu signal peptide (arg4gln) has been
related to warfarin dose requirements [13].
in the current study, we examined the effects of several
genetic variations in genes encoding proteins of the  xxxd3522xxx 
cycle (namely  xxxg2418xxx  and calu) as well as those affecting
drug metabolism (cyp2c*9) on the  xxxd59xxx  earliest
response in patients at the start of therapy.
patients, materials and methods
selected patients and protocol design

one hundred patients were selected from the oral anticoagulation clinic of the hospital morales meseguer and hospital
los arcos (murcia, spain). in order to minimize the effect of
environmental factors, our study included only caucasian men
younger than 75 years (mean age 62.2 ± 6.5 years) with nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation, not taking any medication known to
interfere with  xxxd59xxx , and without liver or other
cardiac dysfunction, who initiated oral anticoagulation therapy. moreover, oncologic, diabetic, hypercholesterolemic and
obese patients were excluded. after providing informed
consent, all selected patient took the same amount of anticoagulant, consisting of 3 mg of  xxxd59xxx  at 6.00 pm for
three consecutive days. this dosage is that usually prescribed in
our clinic for patients with these speciﬁc characteristics at
starting therapy. after that, each patient was monitored and
the personal dosage was adjusted in accordance with data on
the international normalized ratio (inr) values at day 3. the
 xxxd59xxx  dosage for maintenance of stable therapeutic
anticoagulation was achieved in all cases between 2 and
3 weeks. we considered that a patient had a steady inr when
his inr was between 2.0 and 3.0 [6] at least three consecutive
times 3 months after starting therapy.
this study was approved by the institutional review board.
coagulation measurements

citrated anticoagulated venous blood (0.129 mol l–1 citratecontaining tubes; vacutainer, becton dickinson, meylon,
france) was collected at 8.00 a.m. before starting therapy and

after 3 days with 3 mg of  xxxd59xxx . platelet-free plasma
was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 · g for 15 min at 22 c
and kept at – 70 c until the functional studies were performed.
the determinations of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent factors (fii, fvii,
fix and fx) were performed with clotting assays using fii-,
fvii-, fix- and fx-deﬁcient plasma in an automated acl
3000 coagulometer (instrumentation laboratory co., ma,
usa). the inr was determined using an automated assay
(acl futura, instrumentation laboratory co.) with bovine
calcium thromboplastin (pro-il-complex, isi 1.02).
genetic studies

genotyping of the fvii ins-323del polymorphism was
performed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), as previously
described [14]. identiﬁcation of the cyp2c*9 genotype was
performed as indicated elsewhere [15]. determination of the
 xxxg2418xxx  c1173t polymorphism was performed by pcr, using
the conditions and primers described by dõandrea et al. [16]
and single-stranded conformational polymorphism [17]. genotyping of the calu arg4gln polymorphism (rs 2290228) was
performed by pcr/allele-speciﬁc restriction assay (pcrasra) after ampliﬁcation of the calu exon 1 using the
following primers: calu1 f, 5¢-gct ttt cat ttt ctt caa g-3¢ (nucleotide numbers 9192–9210); and calu1b, 5¢gac ccc tga gag  xxxg889xxx  gta cc-3¢ (nucleotide numbers 9485–9466, according to genebank accession number
af013759). pcr was performed in a robocylcer gradient
thermocycler (stratagene) with 30 cycles at 95 c for 45 s, 50 c
for 45 s and 72 c for 45 s, and a ﬁnal extension cycle of 3 min
at 72 c. the pcr product was digested with hpych4 v
(new england biolabs gmbh). the arg4 allele showed a
restriction pattern of 207 and 68 bp, whereas the gln4 allele
yielded 207, 39 and 29 bp. the calu a29809g polymorphism
(rs1043550) was also determined by pcr-asra. brieﬂy, pcr
ampliﬁcation of calu exon 6 [(calu6 f, 5¢-gga tgg caa gct tac caa gg-3¢ (nucleotide numbers 29 700–
29 719); and calu6b, 5¢-gtt tgt agt aac agt ctc ag-3¢ (nucleotide numbers 29 902–29 883)] was carried out
in a robocylcer gradient thermocycler (stratagene) (35 cycles
at 95 c for 30 s, 49 c for 30 s, and 3 min at 72 c). the pcr
product was digested with sati (fermentas, pascual & furió,
valencia, spain), and the restriction proﬁle was evaluated in
polyacrylamide gels. the 29809a allele produced two bands of
148 and 55 bp, whereas the 29809g variant exhibited a
restriction pattern of 95, 55 and 53 bp.
all genotypes identiﬁed in the study were conﬁrmed by
sequencing.
statistical analysis

continuous variables were tested for normal distribution by the
kolmogorov–smirnov test. normally distributed results are
expressed as mean value ± sd, and results that are not
normally distributed as median (interquartile range, iqr).
comparisons between two groups was performed by the
 2007 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

 xxxg2418xxx /calu interaction in  xxxd59xxx  response 1703

unpaired t-test and mann–whitney u-test. correlations
between the measured laboratory indices and clinical and
demographic data were performed using the pearson correlation coefﬁcient. categorical data are expressed as percentages,
and were compared using the chi-squared test; a fisherõs exact
test was performed if relevant. the strength of the association
of polymorphism was estimated by calculation of the odds
ratio with epiinfo software (cdc, atlanta, georgia, usa)
and the cornﬁeld method for the calculation of 95% cis.
multiple logistic regression analyses (enter method) were also
undertaken with adequate responsiveness to  xxxd59xxx 
(inr < 3.5 on the third day) as dependent variables, and age
and analyzed polymorphisms as independent variables. multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore those
variables associated with  xxxd59xxx  dosage at steady
anticoagulation. all analyses were carried out using spss
version 11.0 software (spss inc., chicago, il, usa). a
p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
results
relationship between initial response and genotype

table 1 shows allelic frequencies of the analyzed polymorphisms. the frequencies of the fvii ins-323del, cyp2c*9 and
 xxxg2418xxx  c1173t polymorphisms were in agreement with those
described for similar populations in other studies [9,15,18]. few
data are available about frequencies of calu polymorphisms.
only one study has evaluated the calu arg4gln polymorphism, and found similar frequencies to those observed in our
study [13]. this is the ﬁrst study that has evaluated the calu
a29809g polymorphism, located at the 3¢-untranslated region

(3¢-utr) region of the calu gene. the allele frequencies of
this polymorphism in our population were 0.63 for the 29809a
allele and 0.37 for the 29809g allele. we did not detect linkage
disequilibrium between these two calu polymorphisms (data
not shown).
the initial response to 3 mg of  xxxd59xxx  for three
consecutive days was evaluated by analyzing the reduction in
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent hemostatic proteins and considering its
overall anticoagulant effect (inr). table 2 shows the percentage of reduction of procoagulant  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
proteins after 3 days on treatment relative to their respective
basal value. as indicated, there was a wide range of reduction
of these proteins after starting therapy. however, we did not
ﬁnd any signiﬁcant relationship between the selected polymorphisms and the diminution of fii, fvii, fix and fx after
3 days (table 2). indeed, for any genotype, we still observed a
wide range of values (table 2).
the inr observed after 3 days of anticoagulation was also
highly variable (table 1). we analyzed the relationship of
genotypes with this variability. univariate analyses showed
that the fvii, cyp2c*9, calu arg4gln and calu
a29809g polymorphisms did not signiﬁcantly associate with
the inr after 3 days of oral anticoagulation (table 1). by
contrast, the initial response to  xxxd59xxx  was signiﬁcantly determined by the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype. thus, carriers of
the 1173t allele were more sensitive to the treatment, displaying
high inr values after the initiation of therapy (table 1).
relationship between dose requirement and genotype

the dose required to achieve a steady inr also showed a wide
range of values (table 1). we analyzed the distribution of

 xxxd59xxx  dosage according to the analyzed genotypes
(table 1). again, the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype was the only
polymorphism that was signiﬁcantly associated with the
required dose (1173c/c required higher doses than 1173t;
19.5 mg week–1 vs. 15.8 mg week–1, respectively; p = 0.004)
(table 1). multiple regression analysis showed that age
(p = 0.042) and  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism (p = 0.007) independently associated with the dose required to achieve a steady
inr. we point out that calu 29809a/a patients needed lower
doses than 29809g carriers (15.8 ± 5.9 mg/week vs.
18.1 ± 5.9 mg/week, respectively), although these differences
did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (table 1).
response to  xxxd59xxx  as complex phenotype

as the whole analyzed polymorphism could play a role in oral
anticoagulation, and considering that the sensitivity to therapy
might also be a complex phenotype, we further examined the
effect of combined genotypes on the initial response to
 xxxd59xxx  and dose requirements for a steady inr.
among all possible combinations of two polymorphisms, we
found that the only pair that exerted signiﬁcant effects on inr
and dosage was  xxxg2418xxx /calu a29809g. indeed, this
combination exacerbated the response associated with the
 xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism isolated. thus, 27 patients (a relevant
percentage of the sample) carried the  xxxg2418xxx  1173t/calu
29809a combination and had the highest inr after 3 days of
oral therapy [inr: 2.26 (1.70–3.32)]. accordingly, carriers of
this combination required the lowest dose of  xxxd59xxx  to
achieve a steady inr (14.1 ± 5.1 mg week–1) (table 1).
multiple regression analysis conﬁrmed that the 1173t/calu
29809a combination was a strong and independent factor

determining the responsiveness to  xxxd59xxx  (p = 0.018)
and the required  xxxd59xxx  dose (p = 0.001).
role of polymorphisms in the exacerbated response to
 xxxd59xxx 

we analyzed the role of these polymorphisms in patients with
exacerbated anticoagulant response at starting therapy. three
days after starting therapy, nine patients had an inr ‡ 3.5. we
discarded the inﬂuence of age on inr ‡ 3.5 (p = 0.886). the
 xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism might be involved in such a severe
response, as eight out of 63 patients carrying the 1173t allele
(12.7%) had an inr ‡ 3.5, but only one out of 37 1173c/c
patients (2.7%) (p = 0.092). the calu a29809g genotype
showed a similar weight, as 15.0% (6/40) of 29809a/a patients
had an inr ‡ 3.5, but only 5.0% (3/60) of 29809g carriers
(p = 0.087).
interestingly, we found that the  xxxg2418xxx /calu a29809g
combination was statistically related to the exacerbated
response to oral anticoagulation leading to an inr ‡ 3.5.
thus, 22.2% of patients carrying the combination 1173t/
29809a (6/27 carriers) had an inr ‡ 3.5, whereas 4.1% of
patients carrying any other combination (3/73) had an inr ‡
3.5 after 3 days of therapy (p = 0.005). according to these
data, carriers of the combined 1173t/29809a genotype may
have a 6.67-fold increased risk of overanticoagulation after
starting therapy (95% ci = 1.32–37.43).
discussion
in order to deﬁne more accurately genetic proﬁles that forecast
the response to anticoagulant therapy with  xxxd59xxx , our
 2007 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

 xxxg2418xxx /calu interaction in  xxxd59xxx  response 1705

experimental design was extremely rigorous. using this
approximation, we did not ﬁnd a correlation between the
response to  xxxd59xxx  (inr and required dose) and the
cyp2c*9 genotype, either alone or in combination with
the  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism. indeed, the inﬂuence of the
cyp2c*9 genotype on  xxxd59xxx  therapy is not so clear
as for warfarin therapy [19]. like warfarin,  xxxd59xxx  is
administered as a racemic mixture of the r-enantiomer and the
s-enantiomer. however, there are substantial differences
between the two drugs in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. for  xxxd59xxx , the anticoagulation
potencies of both enantiomers are essentially comparable [20],
and consequently, the pharmacokinetics of r- xxxd59xxx 
are only modestly affected in cyp2c9*1/*3 subjects [21].
accordingly, the overall anticoagulation effect in such heterozygotes would be similar or only modestly increased in
comparison with wild-type homozygotes [21]. thus, conﬂicting
results about the relevance of this polymorphism on  xxxd59xxx  therapy have been published [15,22,23]. therefore,
further studies are required to clarify the relevance of the
cyp2c*9 genotype to anticoagulant therapy with  xxxd59xxx .
by contrast, our study conﬁrms the relevance of the
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype to anticoagulant therapy [8,9]. this is the
ﬁrst study showing that the c1173t genotype did not signiﬁcantly correlate with the decrease of fii, fvii, fix or fx
3 days after start of therapy. however, this polymorphism had
a relevant role in the overall anticoagulant response, as revealed
by the inr values observed after start of therapy and the dose
required to achieve a steady inr.
the chaperone calu appears to regulate the capacity of the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent c-carboxylation system [10,11,24]. the
expression of calu in cos-1 cells inhibited  xxxg2418xxx 
activity and conferred warfarin resistance to the  xxxg2418xxx 
enzymatic complex [10]. recent data suggest that calu may
play a regulatory key in the maintenance of the normal blood
coagulation system [11,24]. moreover, the rs2290228 polymorphism affecting the calu gene (arg4gln) has been
recently associated with the anticoagulant response [13]. these
authors found that one homozygous (gln/gln) patient
required a very high warfarin dose to achieve a steady inr
(20 mg day–1) [13]. this study also showed that the combined
proﬁle of  xxxg2418xxx , cyp2c*9 and calu arg4gln improved
the categorization of individual dose requirements [13]. our
data conﬁrm the role of calu in anticoagulation therapy, but
our results are somewhat conﬂictive regarding the arg4gln
polymorphism. thus, we also identiﬁed a homozygous patient
(gln/gln), but this patient reached a steady anticoagulation
state with a low dose of  xxxd59xxx  (14 mg week–1).
moreover, we did not ﬁnd any relationship between this
polymorphism and oral anticoagulation, either isolated or in
combination with other polymorphisms (cyp2c*9 and/or
 xxxg2418xxx ). thus, our data suggest that the calu arg4gln
polymorphism play a minor role, if any, in  xxxd59xxx 
therapy. a very recent study also failed to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
association between calu arg4gln and warfarin dose

requirements [25]. however, we identiﬁed another polymorphism on the calu gene (rs1043550: a29809g) that may be
considered in this framework. thus, 29809 a/a subjects showed
a tendency to achieve a higher inr at the start of therapy and
to need a lower  xxxd59xxx  dose to achieve a steady inr
than 29809g carriers. more interestingly, the combination of
the calu a29809g and  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t polymorphisms
exacerbated the effect that  xxxg2418xxx  had by itself.
it is necessary to determine the functional consequences of
the calu a29809g polymorphism, located within the 3¢-utr
of the calu gene. this polymorphism could be in linkage
disequilibrium with another genetic modiﬁcation within the
coding or regulatory regions of the calu gene. however, we
have sequenced all six coding regions of the calu gene in 27
subjects with different 29809 genotypes (12 a/a, 10 a/b and 5 b/
b), and we have not found any other linked change. analysis of
the promoter region is required, but it is tempting to speculate
that, similarly to polymorphisms located within the 3¢-utr of
other genes [26], the calu a29809g polymorphism may have
direct functional consequences. we hypothesize that the
29809g variant could affect mrna stability, resulting in
reduced protein levels, which could ﬁnally determine increased
levels of free  xxxg2418xxx . this situation would require larger
doses of coumarins for correct inhibition. additional experiments are required to conﬁrm such a hypothesis.
finally, the other signiﬁcant goal of our study was to
determine the relevance of the combination of  xxxg2418xxx 
c1173t and calu a29809g polymorphisms on anticoagulation
with  xxxd59xxx . subjects carrying the  xxxg2418xxx  1173t
and calu 29809a alleles, who represent an important
percentage of the spanish population (27%), were those who
showed the strongest response to the same dose and required
the lowest dose to achieve an steady inr. the main limitation
of our study is the relatively reduced sample size. conﬁrmatory
studies including large series of patients are necessary, where
more complex proﬁles may also be evaluated in order to make
oral anticoagulation a personalized therapy.
