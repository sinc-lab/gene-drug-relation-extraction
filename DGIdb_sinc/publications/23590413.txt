introduction

type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is a chronic, progressive, multifactorial disease
that affects over 340 million people worldwide with other hundreds of millions at
risk for diabetes [1]. t2dm is associated with significant morbidity, ranking as
the leading cause of renal failure, new-onset blindness, and limb amputations [2].
heart disease and stroke are 2 -- 4 times more common in patients with diabetes,
and these cardiovascular complications remain a leading cause of mortality.
t2dm, conservatively, is the seventh leading cause of death worldwide.
the united kingdom prospective diabetes study [3] demonstrated that within
6 years of diagnosis, one-fifth of subjects reported at least one diabetes-related
micro- or macrovascular complication. multiple recent studies including
accord, advance, vadt, and origin showed that intensive glucose
control had no benefit on macrovascular disease [4-7]. however, hyperglycemia
appears to be the main mediator of microvascular complications [8]. achieving a
glycosylated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) < 7% reduces the microvascular complication rate by 25%, and for every 1% decrease in hba1c, there is a 35% reduction

in the risk of microvascular complications, a 25% reduction
in diabetes-related deaths, and a 7% reduction in all-cause
mortality.
therefore, achieving and maintaining goal glycemic
control is pivotal to the treatment of t2dm. using available
lifestyle and therapeutic interventions to accomplish this goal
is the primary role of the diabetologist.

2.

overview of the market

recommendations from the american diabetes association
and the european association for the study of diabetes
strongly endorse lifestyle modification for all patients with
t2dm. therapeutic treatment algorithms are based on
severity of disease, tolerability, and therapeutic efficacy [9,10].
classes of medications, such as biguanides, sulfonylureas,
thiazolidinediones (tzds), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4)
inhibitors, and a-glucosidase inhibitors, are tier one and
two oral options. metformin is the drug of choice for initial
therapy, unless contraindicated or not tolerated. addition of
second-line therapy can be tailored to patient comorbidities
(i.e., age, risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and renal
function). however, patients unable to achieve glycemic
goal (hba1c < 7%) may benefit from addition of glucagonlike polypeptide-1 (glp-1) agonists and/or insulin therapy,
both injectable. with the high prevalence of diabetes, new
pharmacologic targets represent opportunities to complement
current therapy.
multiple new antidiabetic therapies are being investigated,
including dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(ppar) modulators (in phase iii trials), 11b-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glucokinase activators, and
glycogen phosphorylase activators. however, sodium--glucose
cotransporter 2 ( xxxg2141xxx ) inhibitors have garnered the most
excitement and are furthest in development. this article
will review the available data on the pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and efficacy and safety of
 xxxd413xxx , an  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor.

introduction to the compound

t2dm is characterized by i) an early relative insulin
deficiency (which over time can result in near total insulin
deficiency) and ii) insulin resistance. these pathologic defects
give rise to hyperglycemia. multiple antidiabetic agents target
these mechanisms (i.e., sulfonylureas, insulin, tzds, and
metformin).  xxxd413xxx  improves glycemic control in an
insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of  xxxg2141xxx 
within the kidney (box 1).
the glomerulus filters circulating plasma glucose within
the kidney. once filtered, glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule [10-12]. glucose transport across the apical or luminal membranes of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules is
coupled with sodium transport via sglts.  xxxg2141xxx  is the predominant cell membrane carrier protein within the kidney,
accounting for nearly 90% of renally reabsorbed glucose.
located within the s1 segment of the early proximal
convoluted tubule (pct), it has a low affinity for glucose
(km = 2 mm) with a high capacity of glucose transport [10].
 xxxg2140xxx  mediates a smaller percentage of glucose reabsorption
(~ 10%) within the s2/3 segment of the late pct and has a
low capacity for glucose transport. the main role of
 xxxg2140xxx  is glucose absorption within the gastrointestinal tract.
the nephron reabsorbs all of the filtered plasma glucose, up
to about 144 g/24 h [11]. the pct sodium gradient between
the luminal and intracellular space drives the secondary active
transport of glucose within the epithelial cell (figure 1) [10-12].
then, glucose is passively reabsorbed into the blood via glucose transporter 2 ( xxxg2134xxx ). once the absorptive capacity
of the pct is exceeded and sglts are saturated, glycosuria
occurs. by inhibiting sglts, urinary glucose excretion
(uge) increases by lowering the renal glucose excretion
threshold (rtg) [13-17]. this ultimately results in lower plasma
glucose levels.
nonselective sglt inhibitors, such as phlorizin, had poor
absorption and significant gastrointestinal side effects [18,19]
but led to the development of compounds more specific for
 xxxg2141xxx .  xxxd1987xxx  and  xxxd413xxx  are in phase iii

development (remogliflozin and sergliflozin never made it to
phase iii development). currently,  xxxd413xxx  is the only
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor approved by the us food and drug
administration (fda).  xxxd1808xxx  is the only  xxxg2141xxx 
inhibitor approved by the european medicines agency.

chemistry

 xxxd413xxx , (2s,3r,4r,5s,6r)-2-{3-[5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)thiophen-2-ylmethyl]-4-methyl-phenyl}-6-hydroxymethyltetrahydro-pyran-3,4,5-triol, is an orally administered  xxxg2141xxx 
inhibitor in tablet formulation [20,21].
5.

pharmacodynamics

 xxxd413xxx  is 250 times more potent for  xxxg2141xxx  compared
to  xxxg2140xxx  when tested in vitro [22]. from in vitro studies, the
50% inhibitory concentrations for  xxxg2141xxx  and  xxxg2140xxx 
were reported as 2.2 -- 4.4 nmol/l and 684 -- 910 nmol/l,
respectively [16,17]. estimated systemic inhibition of  xxxg2140xxx 
in vivo suggested only modest inhibition of systemic
 xxxg2140xxx -mediated glucose uptake (21% inhibition predicted
at cmax for 300 mg dose) [20]. there was no evidence of glucose malabsorption when tested clinically with 100 mg daily
and 300 mg twice daily dosing [23].

following oral administration of 300 mg  xxxd413xxx  in
healthy subjects, the plasma appearance of orally ingested glucose was delayed compared to placebo and area under the
curve (auc) for the rate of appearance was reduced at both
1 h (31%) and 2 h (20%) but similar to placebo over
2 -- 6 h [24]. reduced glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (gip) and increased  xxxd1348xxx  and glp-1 suggested
reduced glucose absorption from the upper intestine and
increased absorption from the lower intestine. these findings
are consistent with transient inhibition of  xxxg2140xxx  in the gastrointestinal tract. using delayed plasma acetaminophen concentrations as a surrogate for gastric emptying,  xxxd413xxx 
appears to delay gastric emptying.
 xxxd413xxx  pharmacodynamics has been studied in
healthy and obese subjects as well as subjects with type 2 diabetes. in a phase i study, single escalating oral doses of  xxxd413xxx  (10, 30, 100, 200, 400, 600, or 800 mg per day or
400 mg twice daily) or placebo were investigated in healthy
men [25].  xxxd413xxx  was dosed pre-breakfast (fasting). for
the twice daily dosing, the second dose was administered in
the evening. uge increased in a dose-dependent manner.
at doses > 200 mg, the maximum 24-h uge, 70 g of glucose,
was achieved. the rtg decreased in a dose-dependent fashion.
the maximal renal threshold was 3.4 mmol/l. doses of 400 mg
twice daily and 800 mg daily had similar effects on both 24-h
uge and the rtg. near maximal rtg, suppression was

observed during the first 13 h with 100 -- 200 mg doses.
doses > 200 mg achieved maximal suppression of rtg
over 24 h. postprandial glucose (ppg) and serum insulin
after breakfast were reduced with doses > 200 mg, with significantly different incremental auc for both when compared to placebo (p < 0.05). ppg levels after lunch and
dinner were unaffected.
eighty obese [body mass index (bmi) > 30 kg/m2] subjects
were randomized for 14 days to ascending doses of  xxxd413xxx  (30, 100, 300, or 600 mg daily or 300 mg twice daily) or
placebo [26].  xxxd413xxx , in a dose-dependent manner, significantly increased uge at doses 100 mg daily or greater
(p < 0.0001) and decreased maximal rtg to 3.6 mmol/l.
over the study period, body weight decreased from baseline
between 2.1 and 3.5 kg in the treatment groups.
after a 2-week washout of antihyperglycemic agents
(ahas), 116 subjects with t2dm (mean hba1c 8%) were
randomized to  xxxd413xxx  (30, 100, 200, or 400 mg daily
or 300 mg twice daily) or placebo for 16 days [27]. a trend in
a dose-dependent increase in uge and decrease in rtg was
demonstrated. a maximal mean reduction in 24-h rtg at
day 16 of 5.0 mmol/l was observed with 400 mg daily and
300 mg twice daily. mean fasting plasma glucose (fpg) and
24-h plasma glucose significantly declined from baseline compared to placebo (p < 0.01). subjects treated with  xxxd413xxx 
showed a 1 -- 1.5 kg greater weight loss than placebo.
in a 28-day randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial, patients with t2dm not optimally controlled
on insulin therapy alone or in combination with metformin,
sitagliptin, and/or a tzd were randomized to receive
100 mg daily or 300 mg twice daily of  xxxd413xxx  or placebo [23]. the least-square-mean (lsm) difference from baseline of uge24 h between  xxxd413xxx  100 mg daily and
placebo was 67 g (p < 0.05) and 154 g between 300 mg twice
daily and placebo (p < 0.05). at baseline, rtg was approximately 12.4 -- 12.7 mmol/l, which is higher than what has
been reported previously in healthy subjects (10.0 -11.1 mmol/l) but similar to what has been observed in diabetic
patients [20,28,29]. the lsm difference from baseline of rtg
was reduced by 6.6 and 8.9 mmol/l with 100 mg daily and
300 mg twice daily, respectively, versus placebo (p < 0.05,
both groups). in the 100-mg daily and 300-mg twice daily
groups, respectively, hba1c was reduced by 0.54 and
0.73%, fpg was reduced by 2.6 and 2.8 mmol/l, and body
weight was reduced by 0.7 and 1.2 kg, relative to placebo.
rtg was calculated in these studies using a new formula that
takes into account plasma and urinary glucose measurements
after an oral glucose load [20]. this method was validated by
the company sponsor by comparing the measured rtg with
the rtg measured with “gold standard” method of a stepped
glycemic clamp. across published and unpublished data (but
supplied in a briefing document provided to the fda advisory
committee by the drug sponsor), mean 24-h rtg was reduced
to 2.8 -- 3.3 mmol/l in healthy, nondiabetic subjects and to
approximately 3.9 -- 5.0 mmol/l in subjects with t2dm [20].
4

using plasma glucose and c-peptide concentrations
from two short studies of  xxxd413xxx  (16 days and
12 weeks), significant improvements in beta-cell function,
as assessed by insulin secretion rate and homeostatic assessment model (homa2-b), were seen in subjects with
t2dm treated with at least 100 mg of  xxxd413xxx 
(p < 0.05 vs. placebo) [30].
6.

pharmacokinetics and metabolism

based on the data supplied to the fda advisory committee,
the mean absolute oral bioavailability of 300 mg  xxxd413xxx 
was 65% [20]. food did not affect absorption, but in large
phase iii studies, the drug was administered prior to meals in
order to take advantage of the observed ppg lowering effect.
following single-dose and multiple-dose administration of
100 and 300 mg of  xxxd413xxx  in healthy subjects, tmax was
between 1 and 2 h postdose [20]. cmax was 1059 -- 3148 ng/ml
and increased in a dose-proportional manner up to a dose of
1200 mg. auc¥ for single-dose administration and
auc24 h for multiple-dose administration also increased in
a dose-proportional manner. steady state was achieved after
4 -- 5 days. after intravenous administration, the mean
apparent volume of distribution for  xxxd413xxx  at steady
state was 119 l.
in t2dm patients, not optimally controlled on insulin
therapy alone or in combination with metformin, sitagliptin,
and/or a tzd, tmax of  xxxd413xxx  was achieved between
2.75 and 4 h of dosing [23]. there was a dose-dependent
increase in cmax, 773 ng/ml with 100 mg daily and
3556 ng/ml with 300 mg twice daily. the elimination halflife of 100 mg daily or 300 mg twice daily of  xxxd413xxx 
ranged from 12 to 15 h. this supports the sponsor’s recommendation for once-daily dosing of  xxxd413xxx  [20].
 xxxd413xxx  undergoes o-glucuronidation [20]. there are
two major human metabolites, ether (o)-glucuronides m5
and m7. both are chemically nonreactive and pharmacologically inactive with respect to  xxxg2141xxx  and  xxxg2140xxx  inhibition
in vitro.  xxxd413xxx  is extensively protein bound (> 99%).
excretion of  xxxd413xxx  and its metabolites occurs primarily
in the feces (60%) and urine (32.5%).
drug--drug interactions
in clinical efficacy and safety studies, no adverse drug--drug
interactions were reported. in in vitro and/or in vivo studies,
 xxxd413xxx  has not been found to have a clinically relevant
effect on the auc or cmax of coadministered drugs, including
 xxxd2054xxx  and levonorgestrel,  xxxd2215xxx , warfarin, simvastatin, digoxin, metformin, hydrochlorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ), and
acetaminophen [20,31-33]. coadministration of rifampin substantially reduced auc and cmax of  xxxd413xxx  300 mg daily.
otherwise,  xxxd413xxx  pharmacokinetics were not altered by
drugs that affect enzymes or drug transporters involved in  xxxd413xxx  metabolism.  xxxd413xxx  is not expected to be
affected by displacement protein-binding interactions, as it is

clinical efficacy

the clinical efficacy of  xxxd413xxx  in t2dm has been
assessed according to its introduction as monotherapy and as
add-on therapy to metformin, metformin plus sulfonylurea,
metformin + tzd, and insulin with or without other aha.
while three clinical efficacy studies have been published as
full articles (one phase ii and two phase iii studies), a majority of results from large phase iii studies have only been
published in abstract form thus far. for details and results of
each study described below, see tables 1 and 2. the mean
baseline hba1c ranged from 7.7 to 8.3% across studies.
glycemic control
as monotherapy,  xxxd413xxx  was shown to reduce hba1c
by 0.91 and 1.16% with 26 weeks of treatment with
100 and 300 mg per day, respectively (placebo-corrected;
p < 0.001 vs. placebo) [34]. it was noted that a majority of
the improvements in hba1c occurred by week 12. in the
100- and 300-mg daily groups, respectively, 44.5 and 62.4%
of subjects achieved an hba1c value of < 7.0% by week 26,
which was significantly greater than the proportion of
placebo-treated subjects who reached the same goal (20.6%;
p < 0.001 vs. placebo). additionally, placebo-corrected fpg
was significantly reduced by 2.0 and 2.4 mmol/l, compared
to placebo (p < 0.001).
as add-on to a stable background of metformin,  xxxd413xxx  doses ranging from 50 mg daily to 300 mg twice daily
reduced hba1c from 0.70 to 0.95% at 12 weeks, with all
doses having a significantly greater effect than placebo
(-- 0.22%; p < 0.001) [35]. similarly, in a 52-week study of
 xxxd413xxx  100 or 300 mg daily, hba1c declined by
0.82 and 0.93%, respectively (compared to a reduction of
0.81% in  xxxd2203xxx  6 -- 8 mg daily; both  xxxd413xxx  doses
were non-inferior to  xxxd2203xxx , and  xxxd413xxx  300 mg
daily was superior to  xxxd2203xxx ) [36]. in the former study,
53 -- 72% of subjects receiving  xxxd413xxx  doses of
‡ 100 mg daily achieved an hba1c of < 7%, compared to
34% of subjects receiving placebo (p < 0.05 by logistic regression) [35]. reductions in fpg in the 12-week study ranged
from 16.2 to 27.0 mg/dl (p < 0.001 vs. placebo).
 xxxd413xxx  therapy on a background of metformin and
pioglitazone for 26 weeks induced reductions in hba1c of
0.89 and 1.03% in  xxxd413xxx  100- and 300-mg daily
groups, compared to a decline of 0.26% in the placebo group
(p < 0.001 vs. placebo) [37]. the proportion of participants in
each group that achieved an hba1c of < 7.0% was 46.9, 64.3,
and 32.5%, respectively (p < 0.001 vs. placebo).
in a 26-week study of subjects on stable metformin plus
sulfonylurea therapy,  xxxd413xxx  100 mg and 300 mg daily
reduced hba1c 0.71 and 0.92% and reduced fpg 1.2 and
1.9 mmol/l, respectively, relative to placebo (p < 0.001 vs.

placebo, both parameters) [38]. in a 52-week study of a similar
population,  xxxd413xxx  300 mg daily reduced hba1c
1.03%, compared to a 0.66% reduction with sitagliptin
100 mg daily ( xxxd413xxx  was both non-inferior and superior
to sitagliptin in hba1c reduction). fpg was reduced by
1.7 and 0.3 mmol/l in the  xxxd413xxx  and sitagliptin groups,
respectively (p < 0.001  xxxd413xxx  vs. sitagliptin) [39].
in subjects treated with insulin with or without aha,  xxxd413xxx  100 and 300 mg daily for 18 weeks resulted in
hba1c reductions of 0.65 and 0.73%, relative to placebo
(p < 0.001 vs. placebo) [40]. fpg was reduced by 1.25 and
1.61 mmol/l, compared to placebo (p <0.001 vs. placebo).
also relative to placebo, 12.1 and 17% of subjects in
the 100- and 300-mg daily groups, respectively, attained an
hba1c of < 7% by the end of the study period
(p < 0.001 by logistic regression vs. placebo).

7.1

body weight
after 26 weeks of monotherapy with  xxxd413xxx  100 or
300 mg daily, body weight reduced by 2.2% (1.9 kg) and
3.3% (2.9 kg), respectively, relative to placebo (p < 0.001 vs.
placebo) [34]. as an add-on to metformin,  xxxd413xxx  ranging
from 50 mg daily to 300 mg twice daily resulted in 2.3 -- 3.4%
reductions in body weight from baseline after 12 weeks, compared to a 1.1% decrease in the placebo group (p < 0.001 vs.
placebo) [35]. after 52 weeks of treatment on a background
of metformin therapy, body weight decreased by 4.2 and
4.7% in 100- and 300-mg daily  xxxd413xxx  groups, respectively, compared to a 1.0% increase in body weight with  xxxd2203xxx  therapy (both  xxxd413xxx  groups vs.  xxxd2203xxx ,
p < 0.001) [36]. when added to stable metformin plus sulfonylurea therapy for 26 weeks,  xxxd413xxx  100 and 300 mg daily
resulted in placebo-corrected body weight reductions of
1.4 and 2.0%, respectively (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) [38]. after
52 weeks,  xxxd413xxx  300 mg daily lowered body weight
by 2.5% from baseline (compared to an increase of 0.3% in
sitagliptin 100-mg daily treatment group, p < 0.001) [39]. in
patients on background insulin therapy with or without
ahas, 18 weeks of  xxxd413xxx  100 or 300 mg daily reduced
body weight by 1.9 and 2.4%, respectively, relative to placebo
(p < 0.001 vs. placebo) [40].
7.2

blood pressure
with  xxxd413xxx  100- or 300-mg daily monotherapy, systolic
blood pressure (sbp) was reduced to 3.7 and 5.4 mmhg after
26 weeks (placebo-corrected, p < 0.001 vs. placebo) [34]. in
patients treated with metformin and sulfonylurea, sbp
decreased by 2.2 and 1.6 mmhg after 26 weeks, in 100- and
300-mg daily treatment groups, respectively, relative to placebo,
but changes were not statistically significant compared to placebo [38]. in a similar group of patients treated with  xxxd413xxx 
for 52 weeks, sbp decreased from baseline by 5.1 mmhg (compared to 0.9 mmhg in sitagliptin 100-mg daily treatment
group, p < 0.001) [39]. after 18 weeks of treatment in patients
concurrently treated with insulin with or without aha, sbp

dropped 2.6 and 4.4 mmhg in 100- and 300-mg daily treatment groups, respectively, relative to placebo (p < 0.001 vs.
placebo) [40]. across studies, reductions in diastolic blood
pressure ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 mmhg (placebo-corrected)
and 3.0 mmhg (not placebo-corrected) [34,38-40].
lipids
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) increased
across studies. with  xxxd413xxx  monotherapy, hdl-c was
increased 6.8 and 6.1%, compared to placebo, in 100- and
300-mg daily treatment groups, respectively (p < 0.001 and
p < 0.01, respectively, vs. placebo) [33]. with concurrent
metformin therapy in the phase ii dose-ranging study,  xxxd413xxx  treatment was only significantly associated with an
increase in hdl-c at the 300-mg twice daily treatment level
(4.0 mg/dl, placebo-corrected, p < 0.01 vs. placebo) [35].
hdl-c increased nonsignificantly compared to placebo in
 xxxd413xxx  100- and 300-mg daily treated patients on
background metformin plus sulfonylurea therapy (2.6 and
3.5%, respectively, placebo-corrected) [38]. hdl-c was also
increased nonsignificantly in subjects on metformin and sulfonylurea treated with  xxxd413xxx  300 mg daily compared to
sitagliptin 100 mg daily (7.6 vs. 0.6%, respectively) [39]. in
patients on stable insulin therapy with or without aha,  xxxd413xxx  300 mg daily significantly increased hdl-c by 4.7%
but 100 mg daily did not (0.8%) (placebo-corrected,
p < 0.001 and p = 0.46, respectively) [40].
triglycerides did not tend to change significantly with  xxxd413xxx  therapy. only in one 12-week study of patients on
background metformin therapy, there was a significant reduction of triglycerides from baseline of 28.5 and 35.3 mg/dl in
the 300-mg daily and 300-mg twice daily groups (p < 0.05
and p < 0.01, respectively, vs. placebo) [35].
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) numerically
increased across  xxxd413xxx  treatment studies, but statistical
analyses were not performed. increases ranged from 0.5 to
11.7% (placebo-corrected) [34,38-40]. due to the variance in
increases of hdl-c and ldl-c, the change in the ratio of
ldl-c to hdl-c also varied, ranging from -- 4.0 to 6.1%
(placebo-corrected), but again, statistical analyses were not
performed for this parameter [34,38-40].
changes in non-hdl-c and  xxxg175xxx  (apob)
were reported only in the monotherapy study [34]. nonhdl-c increased by 0.7, 2.7, and 0.7% in the  xxxd413xxx 
100- and 300-mg daily groups and placebo group, respectively (statistical analysis not performed). apob (measured
and analyzed in about 60% of the participant population)
increased by 1.2, 3.5, and 0.9% in the  xxxd413xxx  100and 300-mg daily groups and placebo group, respectively
(significance not reported).

concurrently treated with one or more aha [41]. placebocorrected declines in hba1c (0.57 and 0.70%) and fpg
(1.4 and 1.5 mmol/l) in  xxxd413xxx  100- and 300-mg daily
treatment groups, respectively, were significantly greater than
placebo (p < 0.001). body weight was reduced by 2.3 and
3.0%, and sbp was reduced by 4.6 and 7.9 mmhg (placebo-corrected, p < 0.001 vs. placebo for both parameters).
hdl-c was significantly increased by 5.3 and 4.7% in both
groups, respectively, relative to placebo (p < 0.001).
subjects with chronic kidney disease
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd413xxx  was also tested in patients
with chronic kidney disease [estimated glomerular filtration
rate (egfr) ‡ 30 and < 50 ml/min/1.73 m2; mean baseline
egfr 39.4 ml/min/1.73 m2] [42]. placebo-subtracted changes
in hba1c were -- 0.30 and -- 0.40% for  xxxd413xxx 
100 and 300 mg daily, respectively (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001,
respectively, vs. placebo). for other clinical parameters,
 xxxd413xxx  treatment resulted in numerically greater improvements than placebo, but statistical analyses were not
performed (see tables 1 and 2 for results).

safety and tolerability

safety and tolerability data reviewed below were derived from
phase ii and iii clinical efficacy and safety studies as well as a
pooled analysis of data derived from eight phase iii studies
(non- xxxd413xxx , n = 3262;  xxxd413xxx  100 mg,
n = 3092;  xxxd413xxx  300 mg, n = 3085; total, n = 9439)
that was included in the aforementioned briefing document
provided to an fda advisory panel [20].
serious adverse events
across studies, the rates of serious adverse events (aes) and aerelated discontinuations were generally low and similar among
 xxxd413xxx , active-comparator, and placebo groups [34-42].
results of a meta-analysis of cardiovascular events were
reported in the pooled analysis [20]. for a composite end point
that included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction,
stroke, and hospitalized unstable angina, hazards ratios (hrs)
were 0.91 [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.65, 1.28] and
0.92 (95% ci, 0.65, 1.28) for the  xxxd413xxx  100- and
300-mg daily treated subjects, respectively, versus non- xxxd413xxx -treated subjects. the hr was < 1 for each individual
type of event included in the composite end point except
combined fatal and nonfatal stroke, for which the hr was
1.47 (95% ci, 0.83, 2.59) for  xxxd413xxx  versus noncanagliflozin treatment. in a follow-up analysis that included
results from two additional studies, the hr was 1.29 (95%
ci, 0.80, 2.09). upon examination of the trial that recruited
subjects with an elevated cardiovascular risk, more subjects randomized to  xxxd413xxx  experienced a cardiovascular event in
the first 30 days of treatment compared to placebo-treated
subjects [20]. however, from 31 -- 90 days of treatment, there
were more cardiovascular events in the placebo groups
8.1

expert opin. drug metab. toxicol. [early online]

 xxxd413xxx 

compared to the  xxxd413xxx  groups. as the pattern of events
could not be temporally associated with aes related to reduced
intravascular volume, it was concluded by the authors of the
briefing document supplied to the fda advisory panel that
the increase in cardiovascular events in  xxxd413xxx  group in
the first 30 days was likely a chance finding.
hypoglycemia
in studies of  xxxd413xxx  as monotherapy or as an addon to a diabetes treatment not associated with hypoglycemia
(i.e., metformin), the rates of hypoglycemia ranged from
2 to 7% compared to 2 to 3% in placebo groups [34,35,41].
results from the pooled analysis were similar with 2.2, 3.8,
and 4.3% of subjects reporting hypoglycemia events for
placebo and  xxxd413xxx  100- and 300-mg daily groups,
respectively (not considered to be dose-related) [20]. the event
rate per subject-year exposure was 0.10, 0.22 and 0.18 for the
three groups, respectively. in trials involving  xxxd413xxx  as
an add-on to a diabetes treatment associated with hypoglycemia (i.e., sulfonylurea or insulin), hypoglycemia occurred in
26 -- 53% of  xxxd413xxx -treated subjects, compared to
15 -- 38% of subjects in placebo groups [38,40-42]. as noted
by the authors of the pooled analysis, when  xxxd413xxx 
300 mg daily was compared to sitagliptin 100 mg daily (an
aha not associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia) in
patients on background metformin plus sulfonylurea therapy,
the rates of hypoglycemia were similar in the two treatment
groups (43.2 vs. 40.7%, respectively; event rate per
subject-year exposure, 3.81 vs. 4.14) [20,39].

8.2

urinary tract infections/genital mycotic infections
the rates of urinary tract infections were low throughout trials, ranging from 4 -- 8% in  xxxd413xxx  treatment groups
and 2 -- 6% in placebo and active-comparator groups [34,36-42].
results from the pooled data analysis were similar, with
8.2 and 6.7% rates of urinary tract infection aes in
 xxxd413xxx  and non- xxxd413xxx  groups, respectively [20].
consistent with the increase in uge, genital mycotic
infections, identified by subject-reported symptoms, occurred
more frequently in  xxxd413xxx -treated subjects than in
placebo or active-comparator-treated subjects. the rates of
infection in males and females treated with  xxxd413xxx 
were 2 -- 9 and 8 -- 24%, respectively. in placebo and activecomparator groups, the rates of infection in males and females
were 0 -- 1 and 0 -- 5%, respectively [34,36-42]. from the pooled
analysis, the rate of vulvovaginitis was 14.3% in canagliflozintreated patients versus 3.1% in non- xxxd413xxx -treated
patients [20]. male genital infections occurred at a rate of
8.3 and 1.6% in the two groups, respectively. in a 12-week,
phase ii, dose-ranging study of  xxxd413xxx , self-administered
vaginal swabs for candida culture were collected from
198 females at baseline and end of study [35,43]. in an analysis
published separately from the original study, it was reported
that 31 and 14% of  xxxd413xxx - and placebo/sitagliptintreated subjects, respectively, converted from negative
8.3

cultures at baseline to positive cultures at week 12 (odds
ratio, 2.8; 95% ci, 1.0 -- 7.3 for  xxxd413xxx  vs. placebo/
sitagliptin) [43]. subjects with a positive culture at baseline
(23/198, 12%) were at increased risk of experiencing a
symptomatic vulvovaginal ae (odds ratio, 9.1; 95% ci,
2.4 -- 34.0). across studies, patients were treated with oral
and/or topical antifungal therapies, usually without discontinuation of study treatment [34,36,38-42].
osmotic diuresis- and volume-related aes
subjects were monitored for osmotic diuresis-related aes (i.e.,
pollakiuria, polyuria, thirst). symptoms occurred at a similar
rate among treatment groups, with < 3 -- 6% of subjects
reporting symptoms for each specific ae within this
category [34,36,38-42]. results from the pooled analysis showed
that 2.4, 7.3, and 7.9% of subjects in the non- xxxd413xxx 
and  xxxd413xxx  100- and 300-mg groups, respectively,
experienced an osmotic diuresis-related ae, with 0.1, 0.3,
and 0.3% experiencing events requiring discontinuation [20].
events were considered non-dose-related and generally
occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment.
volume-related aes (i.e., postural dizziness, orthostatic
hypotension) were only reported in two studies (monotherapy
and  xxxd413xxx  add-on to insulin), with symptom rates of
0 -- 3% in  xxxd413xxx  groups and 0% in placebo
groups [34,40]. in the pooled analysis, the volume-related aes
were increased dose-dependently with  xxxd413xxx  100 and
300 mg daily, compared to non- xxxd413xxx  treatment, at
rates of 3.2, 4.6, and 2.4%, respectively [20]. the rates of
serious aes in this category were similar across groups. in
the 300-mg group, events occurred earlier, within 12 weeks.
further analysis revealed an increased risk of reduced intravascular volume aes with age ‡ 75 years, use of loop diuretics, or
egfr < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. the rates of aes in these
subgroups were > 8 and 3 -- 5% in the  xxxd413xxx  300and 100-mg groups, respectively. in response to volumerelated aes, dosing of blood pressure medications, including
diuretics, was often modified.
8.4

other aes
from the pooled data analysis, constipation occurred in
3.13.0, and 2.4% of subjects in  xxxd413xxx  100- and
300-mg and non- xxxd413xxx  groups, respectively [20]. rash
and urticaria, respectively, were reported in 1.6 versus
1.3% and 0.4 versus 0.3% of subjects randomized to  xxxd413xxx  and non- xxxd413xxx  treatment. after 52 weeks of
 xxxd413xxx  treatment in older subjects, small reductions in
bone density occurred, as assessed in the total hip and lumbar
spine, but were postulated to arise from small reductions in
body weight [20]. there were a numerically larger number of
low-trauma upper limb fractures early in  xxxd413xxx  treatment compared to placebo. it was concluded that  xxxd413xxx  treatment would not increase low-trauma fracture risk
via reduced bone density; however, a relationship between
this risk and reduced intravascular volume aes has not been
8.5

completely ruled out. the rates of breast, bladder, and renal
cancers were low, and there was no meaningful imbalance of
events among treatment groups [20].
renal effects
from the pooled analysis, renal-related aes occurred at a rate
of 2.5, 3.1, and 3.6% in non- xxxd413xxx  and  xxxd413xxx 
100- and 300-mg daily groups, respectively [20]. incidence of
renal-related aes in those with reduced renal function
(egfr < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) was 3.7, 8.9, and 9.3%. most
events occurred early, as with volume-related aes. a greater
proportion of subjects in the  xxxd413xxx  300-mg daily group
discontinued as a result of an ae related to reduced renal function compared to  xxxd413xxx  100-mg group or placebo in
both the overall and renal pooled analyses (1.1 and 1.6%,
respectively, vs. 0.5 and 1.2% in  xxxd413xxx  100-mg groups
and 0.5 and 1.0% in non- xxxd413xxx  groups).
with  xxxd413xxx  treatment, egfr tends to first decrease
and then stabilize or trend back toward baseline [20,42].
this change is most likely the result of pre-renal hemodynamics. in the pooled analysis, using a last observation carried
forward analysis, 6.2, 6.4, and 9.7% of subjects on
non- xxxd413xxx  and  xxxd413xxx  100 and 300 mg daily,
respectively, had a decrease in egfr > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2
between baseline and any point during treatment, mostly
occurring by week 6 [20]. in subjects with impaired renal function (egfr < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2), decreases in egfr
of > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 occurred at a rate of 4.9, 9.3, and
12.2% in the three groups [20]. with discontinuation, egfr
tended to increase to at or just below baseline egfr values.
in the 26-week phase iii study of  xxxd413xxx  treatment in
patients with chronic kidney disease (mean baseline egfr
39.4 ml/min/1.73 m2), mean changes in egfr were -- 9.1
and -- 10.1% in the  xxxd413xxx  100- and 300-mg daily
groups, compared to -- 4.5% in the placebo group, with largest reductions observed at week 3 [42].

an increased hr of fatal and nonfatal stroke and a transient
increase in cardiovascular events in the first 30 days of
treatment, will need to be addressed in longer term safety
monitoring.

regulatory affairs

 xxxd413xxx  (trade name  xxxd413xxx ) was approved by
the fda in april 2013 for treatment of adults with t2dm
[44,45].
10.

conclusion

in summary, at doses proposed for approval by the fda
(100 and 300 mg daily),  xxxd413xxx  treatment induced significant reductions in hba1c (0.6 -- 1.1%), body weight
(1.4 -- 3.3%), and sbp (2.6-7.9 mmhg), and a significant
increase in hdl-c (4.7 -- 6.8%) across a range of background
t2dm therapies (placebo-corrected). there was a low risk of
hypoglycemia in relation to  xxxd413xxx  treatment. the main
side effects included an increased risk of genital mycotic infections and osmotic diuresis- and reduced intravascular volumerelated events. concerns about increases in ldl-c, as well as

expert opinion

effective treatment of t2dm requires a multifactorial
approach, including lifestyle counseling and pharmacologic
management. given the significant number of diagnosed
diabetic, prediabetic, and undiagnosed diabetic patients, there
are a relatively small number of ahas at our disposal.
progressive deterioration of beta-cell function, weight gain,
and hypoglycemia still remain the major hurdles in treating
type 2 diabetes and remain difficult to overcome with the
currently available therapies. the mainstay treatments such
as metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin have been nicely
complemented by the addition of glp-1 agonists and
dpp-4 inhibitors. less effective agents such as colesevelam
and bromocriptine were not developed for diabetes treatment,
but found to have relatively minor antihyperglycemic properties. in the case of  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors, the renal filtration of
circulating glucose offers a novel, non-insulin-mediated,
physiologic mechanism to exploit.
 xxxd413xxx ’s relatively modest improvement on hba1c,
fpg, ppg, and weight appear to be similar to  xxxd1808xxx ,
which is currently approved in europe [46]. like  xxxd1808xxx ,
 xxxd413xxx  has been tested and has modest efficacy as add-on
therapy to metformin, poiglitazone, sitagliptin, and insulin,
but the latter is currently only being considered as adjunct to
diet and lifestyle modification. the greatest hba1c effects are
seen in a subset of patients with worse glycemic control
(hba1c > 10%) [34,] and when used as monotherapy, however,
 xxxd413xxx  was able to complement existing therapy to
achieve hba1c < 7% in a greater proportion of patients compared to placebo in studies of patients with moderate glycemic
control (hba1c 7 -- 8%).  xxxd1808xxx  is not recommended
with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (egfr < 60 ml/
min/1.73 m2).  xxxd413xxx  was studied and found to
be safe in patients with moderate renal impairment
(egfr < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) but may cause a reduction in
egfr, and thus, dose reduction may be necessary in this
population [20]. additionally, dose reduction is suggested for
patients > 75 years of age and on concurrent loop diuretics
to reduce the risk of renal impairment and volume-related
aes. of note, there is evidence that  xxxd413xxx  exhibited a
lesser magnitude of hba1c reduction and body weight in
subjects with an egfr < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 [47].
based on efficacy,  xxxd413xxx  will likely be a second- or
third-line treatment, behind metformin, sulfonylurea, insulin,
and incretin therapy. however, its side-effect profile, such as
low risk of hypoglycemia, weight loss, and safety in the elderly
and with renal dysfunction, offers potential therapeutic use in
specific populations. in fact, it is these same properties that
have garnered such enthusiasm for dpp-4 inhibitors and

glp-1 agonists. in addition, it offers another option to
those patients resistant to injection therapy (insulin and
glp-1 agonists).
the unexplained increase in fatal and nonfatal stroke, as
well as the transient increase in cardiovascular events in the
first 30 days of treatment, continues to be evaluated. additionally, the longer term impact of increased ldl-c remains
to be determined. often diabetic patients have comorbid cardiovascular issues including hyperlipidemia. unfortunately,
aggressive monitoring and treatment of ldl-c may be even
more necessary. longer term adherence and tolerability of frequent mycotic infections, especially in female patients, is of
interest. the relationship of low-trauma fractures to  xxxd413xxx  therapy is not clear. there is an unclear association of
breast and bladder cancer observed with  xxxd1808xxx  that
has not been detected with  xxxd413xxx .

 xxxd413xxx  offers a new tool in the vast array of therapeutic options available to treat t2dm. its favorable sideeffect profile, such as low incidence of hypoglycemia and
weight loss, may balance its relatively modest reduction in
hba1c, fpg, and ppg, and mild elevation in ldl-c. concerns about cardiovascular risks will need to be weighed against
the potential benefits, both for fda approval and in clinical
use. more information, including peer-reviewed published
data, will be useful to interpret and decide where  xxxd413xxx 
should fall within the diabetic treatment algorithm.
