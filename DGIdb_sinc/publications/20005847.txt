summary

hydroxyurea (hu) specifically inhibits class i ribonucleotide reductase (rnr), depleting dntp pools
and leading to replication fork arrest. although hu
inhibition of rnr is well recognized, the mechanism
by which it leads to cell death remains unknown. to
investigate the mechanism of hu-induced cell death,
we used a systems-level approach to determine the
genomic and physiological responses of e. coli to
hu treatment. our results suggest a model by which
hu treatment rapidly induces a set of protective
responses to manage genomic instability. continued
hu stress activates iron uptake and toxins mazf and
rele, whose activity causes the synthesis of incompletely translated proteins and stimulation of envelope stress responses. these effects alter the properties of one of the cell’s terminal cytochrome oxidases,
causing an increase in superoxide production. the
increased superoxide production, together with the
increased iron uptake, fuels the formation of hydroxyl
radicals that contribute to hu-induced cell death.
introduction
hydroxyurea (hu) is commonly used in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes to study dna damage-independent replication fork
arrest (lopes et al., 2001; sogo et al., 2002; timson, 1975). hu
is exquisitely specific for inhibiting class i ribonucleotide reductase (rnr), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of dntps
under aerobic conditions in many organisms, including escherichia coli, yeast, and humans (rosenkranz et al., 1967; sinha and
snustad, 1972). several lines of evidence have indicated that
rnr is the primary, if not only, cellular target of hu (fuchs and
karlstrom, 1973; kren and fuchs, 1987; sjoberg et al., 1986;
sneeden and loeb, 2004). depletion of dntp pools through
hu treatment leads to replication fork arrest and subsequent

genomic instability (ahmad et al., 1998; nakayama et al., 1994),
most likely through substrate starvation (foti et al., 2005; godoy
et al., 2006; timson, 1975). although hu has been used to study
replication fork arrest for decades, very little is known about the
downstream physiological effects of hu-dependent replication
fork arrest, especially the mechanism by which hu leads to loss
of cell viability and eventual lysis.
an intriguing but unexplained observation is that prolonged hu
stress results in cell death and lysis mediated in part by the mazef
and relbe toxin/antitoxin modules (godoy et al., 2006). depletion
of thymine pools (thymineless death) has similarly been suggested
to involve mazf activation in e. coli (sat et al., 2003). our observation that variants of the translesion dna polymerase umuc, acting
in combination with the translesion polymerase dinb and the
umud gene products, may mitigate such mazef- or relbeinduced death has led us to suggest that hu-induced death of
e. coli is brought about not by stalled replication forks directly,
but rather through a series of downstream processes involving
the toxin/antitoxin pairs mazef and relbe (godoy et al., 2006).
to understand how hu-dependent replication fork arrest leads
to cell death, we used a systems-level analysis to identify the
genomic and physiological effects of hu treatment. we present
a mechanism whereby hu treatment rapidly induces several
survival responses, including upregulation of the sos response,
downregulation of cell division inhibition, and induction of rnr
synthesis. however, as hu stress continues, toxin modules
mazf and rele are activated, triggering a cascade of events
that eventually results in the production of deleteriously hydroxyl
radicals. the production of hydroxyl radicals is exacerbated by
increased iron uptake, and these harmful reactive oxygen species
contribute to the majority of hu-mediated cell death in e. coli.

hu-induced oh production in e. coli

however, cells do not begin to die until 2–3 hr into the treatment,
and cell survival declines to 0.1% by 6 hr (figure 1). we examined gene expression profiles of exponentially growing mc4100
cultures following 1 hr of treatment with or without 100 mm
hu. at this 1 hr time point, hu-treated cultures do not show
decreased survival but do show growth inhibition (figure 1a).
we hypothesized that expression profiles at this time during
hu treatment would allow us to gain insights into the early
cellular events that lead to cell death and lysis.
rna from three independent cultures treated with or without
hu were analyzed using affymetrix antisense genome microarrays. the expression results were integrated into an e. coli
microarray expression database (faith et al., 2007; http://m3d.
bu.edu/) for analysis comparing the hu results to more than
500 additional expression profiles (faith et al., 2007). we examined significance (z score) of gene expression on a gene-by-gene
basis through comparison of expression levels with or without
hu treatment in the framework of the mean and standard deviation (sd) of expression for each gene across all conditions in
the compendium (see experimental procedures for additional
details). this allowed us to determine the statistically significant
changes in expression due to hu treatment in terms of units of
sd by subtracting, on a gene-by-gene basis, the z score for an
untreated control from the z score for an hu-treated sample.
this procedure allowed us to filter our expression profile to identify those genes that showed altered transcript level specifically
in response to hu (table s1 available online).
hu rapidly induces survival responses to manage dna
damage
our microarray analysis showed induction of cell survival
responses to manage hu-induced cell stress (table s1). we
have grouped these survival responses into three categories
(table 1).
(1) upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase synthesis
consistent with previous observations (gibert et al., 1990), we
found a significant increase in gene and protein expression of
the components of class i rnr, nrda and nrdb, in response
to hu treatment (table 1 and figures  xxxd3227xxx  and s1b). in addition,
genes encoding e. coli anaerobic class iii rnr (nrddg) and
a cryptic rnr (nrdef) (jordan and reichard, 1998) showed
significant transcriptional increases (table 1). we were surprised
to find substantial induction of nrddg, given that any nrddg
produced would be irreversibly inactivated under our aerobic
conditions. these observations suggest that upregulation of all
rnr genes in response to hu-induced dntp pool depletion is
a strong survival response.
(2) upregulation of primosome components
we also observed that components of the primosome, pria and
prib, were substantially upregulated by hu treatment (table 1).
pria and prib can assemble forks on either the leading or lagging
strand (heller and marians, 2005, 2006; lovett, 2005). the pria
pathway for replication restart is most efficient on fork structures
without gaps in the leading strand. this structure could be
formed after the collapse of a replication fork. an alternative
pric-dependent pathway preferentially utilizes forks with large
gaps in the leading strand. we did not observe upregulation of
pric (table 1), an observation consistent with the mode of fork

damage induced by hu treatment. upregulation of primosome
components may help restart replication forks stalled or collapsed following hu treatment. of note, induction of primosome
components is not part of the sos response (simmons et al.,
2008a).
(3) activation of the sos response
consistent with previous work (barbe et al., 1987), our microarray analysis revealed that numerous genes in the dna-damageresponsive sos network were induced by hu treatment
(table 1). the sos response involves the upregulation of 57
genes involved in numerous aspects of dna repair and other
cellular functions (simmons et al., 2008a). in agreement with
the transcriptional data, sula and reca protein levels showed
a significant increase following hu challenge (figures s1c
and s1d).
recent work has shown that a small subpopulation of cells can
account for large transcriptional changes in microarray analyses
of the sos response (britton et al., 2007; simmons et al., 2008b).
to determine the population of sos-induced cells after hu treatment, we used the pl(lexo)-gfp construct in which gfp expression is controlled by lexa (dwyer et al., 2007) as a single-cell
marker of sos induction. no gfp fluorescence was observed
in the absence of hu (data not shown), but we did observe
gfp fluorescence soon after hu treatment (figure 1b, i). after
a 30 min exposure to hu, gfp fluorescence was clearly visible
in the vast majority of cells (figure 1b, ii), indicating that sos
induction occurred uniformly in the bulk of the population.
to explore the contribution of the sos response to hu
survival, we tested the sensitivity of the lexa3 mutant strain to
increasing amounts of hu (figure 1c). the lexa3 strain carries
a noncleavable form of lexa, effectively preventing sos induction (friedberg et al., 2005; mount et al., 1972). the lexa3 strain
was 10-fold more sensitive relative to the parental strain
through a range of hu concentrations, indicating that activation
of the sos-regulated genes helps cells survive hu exposure. hu
is much less stable in liquid culture than in solid lb agar (s.t.
lovett, personal communication), possibly due to increased
oxidation of hu in liquid. we found that 100 mm hu was required
for significant killing in liquid cultures (figure 1a), whereas
5–30 mm hu was sufficient to observe growth difference
between strains in lb agar plating assays (figure 1c).
hu treatment induces extreme filamentation (godoy et al.,
2006), which could occur due to sula-mediated inhibition of
septum formation. however, upregulation of sula alone cannot
completely account for the observed increase in filamentation
because hu-induced filamentation still occurs in a dsula background (figure s1e and s1f). a functionally linked cluster of
genes involved early in cell division, including several genes
involved in septum formation (e.g., ftsz, ftsq, zipa) and a positive
regulator of ftsz, rcsb (table 1), showed significant downregulation in our microarrays. in agreement with the transcriptional
result, we observed a decrease in ftsz protein level (figure s1g).
to determine whether the downregulation of genes required for
septum assembly was sufficient to perturb septum formation, we
analyzed z ring formation at the single-cell level using an ftszgfp fusion (weiss et al., 1999). ftsz-gfp does not functionally
complement endogenous ftsz but is able to decorate the
wild-type protein forming z rings, allowing for visualization by

fluorescence microscopy (ma et al., 1996). induction of ftszgfp by iptg was comparable in hu-treated and nontreated
cultures (figure s1h). under nonstress conditions, we observed
septal ring formation in mc4100 cells at midcell (figure 1d).
however, when ftsz-gfp was induced following hu treatment,
the elongated cells did not show z ring formation (figure 1d).
in fact, we did not observe z rings in any hu-treated cells
(data not shown). together, these results strongly suggest that
the decreased expression of ftsz and other septum assembly
genes is sufficient to perturb normal septum formation.
hu-induced iron uptake response is nonuniform
and associated with cell death
we also observed several functional classes of genes whose
expression changes we could not easily explain as survival
responses. our microarray analysis indicated that many genes
encoding the fep, fec, fhu, and feo iron uptake systems (postle
and larsen, 2007) were significantly upregulated after 1 hr of hu
treatment (table 1). iron is required for numerous biological
purposes, including playing a catalytic role in class i rnr
(stubbe, 2003), so it seemed possible that increased iron uptake
in response to hu represents an effort to replenish rnr. however, excessive amounts of iron can be deleterious to e. coli,
catalyzing the production of highly destructive hydroxyl radicals
(ohd) through fenton chemistry (jakubovics and jenkinson,
2001). to test whether such a strong hu-induced iron uptake
had an overall beneficial or detrimental effect on e. coli, we disrupted tonb, which is a component of the tonb/exbb/exbd
inner-membrane protein complex. tonb is important for iron
uptake because it couples the dedicated outer-membrane iron
transporters fepa, feca, and fhue to the proton-motive force

we further explored the relationship between
iron uptake and cell death by staining mc4100
cells carrying pl(furo)-gfp with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide.  xxxd3027xxx  iodide is used as a marker
for cell death, as it is only able to enter and stain
bacteria that have damaged cell membranes. after 3 hr of hu
treatment, we found that 20% of cells stained with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide and that 98% of  xxxd3027xxx  iodide-stained cells also
showed increased levels of fur-regulated gfp expression (n =
810 cells). in sum, these results indicated that, unlike the uniform
sos survival response, the induction of genes involved in iron
uptake occurs later to two distinguishable levels and correlates
with cell death.

(wandersman and delepelaire, 2004; wiener, 2005). we found
that disruption of tonb increased resistance of the strain to hu
(figure 2a), suggesting that the strong upregulation of iron
uptake has an overall negative impact on cell survival under
hu stress.
we asked whether the increased iron uptake occurred on the
same timescale as hu-protective responses such as the sos
response. to explore the temporal relationship between iron
uptake and hu treatment, we observed mc4100-carrying plasmid pl(furo)-gfp that expresses gfp under the control of the
iron-responsive transcriptional regulator fur. fur controls
expression of three major iron transport systems upregulated
in our microarray: fec, fep, and fhu. in contrast to induction
of the sos-regulated gfp response, we did not observe furregulated gfp expression after 15 min of hu treatment and
observed only minor induction at 30 min (figure 1b, iii and iv).
under the same exposure conditions, we did observe a significant increase in fur-regulated gfp expression after 1 hr of hu
treatment, consistent with our microarray data (figure 2b). interestingly, our microscopy indicated that there were two subpopulations of gfp-expressing cells after 1 hr of hu treatment. both
subpopulations showed gfp fluorescence above the untreated

quenching of hydroxyl radicals prevents hu-induced
cell death
we had speculated that increased iron uptake might be detrimental to the cell by increasing ohd formation (imlay et al.,
1988). to test this idea, we monitored the fluorescence of the
dye, 30 -(r-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf), in cultures after
hu treatment (kohanski et al., 2007). hpf is oxidized with high
specificity by ohd to a fluorescent product (setsukinai et al.,
2003). one hour after hu treatment, we observed ohd formation
in mc4100 that steadily increased until reaching a maximum at
4 hr (figure 2c). the first major increase in ohd formation
coincides exactly with the first major decrease in cell viability
after hu exposure (figure 1a). this correlation suggests that

hu-induced ohd production in e. coli

hu-induced cell death may be due, at least in part, to increased
ohd levels.
to test whether the increased ohd production that we observe
following hu treatment is causally related to cell death, we
quenched ohd using the potent ohd scavenger thiourea
(novogrodsky et al., 1982; repine et al., 1981; touati et al.,
1995). though similar in structure to hu, thiourea is not a potent
inhibitor of rnr because it lacks the key hydroxyl group that
inactivates rnr and thus does not affect culture growth (figure 2d) (stubbe, 2003). addition of thiourea to cultures essentially prevented hu-induced cell death (figure 2d) and strongly
decreased ohd formation (figure 2e). in other words, thiourea
changes hu from a bactericidal stress into a bacteriostatic
stress. thiourea did not interfere with the hu-dependent arrest
of dna synthesis (figure s2b). because thiourea has been
shown to scavenge another radical, hocl (wasil et al., 1987),
we cannot rule out the possibility that thiourea may be quenching
additional unknown radicals that also contribute to hu-induced
cell death. nevertheless, the virtually complete abrogation of cell
death brought about by thiourea treatment strongly suggests
that ohd and possibly other radicals play a causal role in the
chain of events that leads to cell death in response to prolonged
hu treatment.
ohd formation via the fenton reaction occurs when hydrogen
peroxide (h2o2) interacts with  xxxd2385xxx . there are a number of
enzymes that can remove harmful reactive oxygen species
(ros), and in e. coli, ahpcf encodes for one of the key h2o2scavenging enzymes (seaver and imlay, 2001). we examined
survival of an dahpc strain and found that loss of ahpc increased
sensitivity to hu through a range of hu concentrations (figure 2f). this result strongly supports our inference that hu
induces ohd formation via fenton chemistry and that this ros
contributes to hu-mediated cell death.
replication fork arrest promotes ohd production
our results indicate that ohd play a causal role in hu-mediated
cell death, yet blocking iron uptake by deleting tonb results in
only a modest increase on survival in the presence of hu.
thus, though increased iron likely contributes to hu-mediated
cell death by promoting ohd formation, our results suggest
that there must be additional factors responsible for the high
levels of ohd production after hu treatment.
although rnr is widely thought to be the sole cellular target of
hu (fuchs and karlstrom, 1973; kren and fuchs, 1987; sjoberg
et al., 1986; sneeden and loeb, 2004), it was still possible that

the increased iron uptake and ohd production, which contribute
to cell death, were off-target effects of hu treatment. to address
these issues, we first treated mc4100 with guanazole and again
monitored for increased iron uptake and hydroxyl radical formation. guanazole is a highly specific inhibitor of rnr that is chemically distinct from hu (foti et al., 2005; jones et al., 2007; moore
and hurlbert, 1985). treatment of mc4100 with 100 mm guanazole resulted in 0.1% survival after 6 hr, similar to hu treatment
(figure 3a). we monitored iron uptake using plasmid pl(furo)gfp. treatment of mc4100 carrying pl(furo)-gfp with either
hu (figure 3b) or guanazole (figure 3c) resulted in a substantial
increase in fur-regulated gfp fluorescence, as measured by
flow cytometry. furthermore, treatment of mc4100 with guanazole also strongly induced ohd production (figure 3d). these
results support the hypothesis that both increased iron uptake
and ohd production are due to inhibition of rnr activity rather
than an off-target effect of hu.
to determine whether increased iron uptake and ohd were
due strictly to the inhibition of rnr or to the downstream effects
of replication fork arrest, we tested a temperature-sensitive dnae
mutant (strauss et al., 2005) for iron uptake and ohd production
at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. dnae codes
for the a-catalytic subunit of dna polymerase iii holoenzyme and
is essential for dna synthesis (gefter et al., 1971; wickner and
kornberg, 1974), and incubation at the nonpermissive temperature leads to replication fork arrest in the dnae(ts) mutant. at the
permissive temperature, the dnae(ts) strain was identical to the
parental strain with respect to growth, expression of iron uptake,
and ohd formation (data not shown). after 5 hr at the nonpermissive temperature of 40 c, the dnae(ts) strain viability had
decreased to 0.1% (figure 3e). of interest, at the nonpermissive
temperature, the dnae(ts) strain did not exhibit a change in iron
uptake response (figures s2b and s2c) but did show a significant increase in ohd formation (figure 3f) compared to the
wild-type control strain. in fact, the first major increase in ohd
production was observed at the same time as the first major
decrease in dnae(ts) mutant cell survival. these observations
support our conclusion that, in addition to the increase in iron
uptake caused by hu treatment, there must be additional
cellular responses resulting from the blocked replication fork
that play a major role in ohd production and subsequent cell
death.
the major source of reactive oxygen species in the cell is from
the inappropriate reduction of oxygen during electron transport
through the respiratory chain (imlay and fridovich, 1991). it

hu-induced oh production in e. coli

was recently shown that lethality of a temperature-sensitive dna
polymerase iii mutant could be overcome (strauss et al., 2005) by
disrupting one the major respiratory cytochrome oxidases, cytochrome oxidase bd (poole and cook, 2000; strauss et al., 2005).
we hypothesized that replication fork arrest was ultimately disrupting electron transport chain activity, which was leading to
increased ros production. agreeing with this, we found that
deleting cydb, which encodes subunit b of one of the major respiratory terminal cytochrome oxidases, prevented hu-induced cell
death (figure 3g). furthermore, deletion of cydb nearly completely prevented hu-induced ohd formation (figure 3h).
mazef and relbe act synergistically to promote cell
death and ohd production and are additive
in their effects with increased iron uptake
our observations that the dnae(ts) mutant produced ohd at the
nonpermissive temperature and that the dcydb mutant exhibited
increased survival following hu treatment point toward replication fork arrest as a key element underlying ros formation
during hu stress. it was also recently shown that the action of
mazf can mediate cell death in response to certain antibiotics
by producing reactive oxygen species (kolodkin-gal et al.,
2008). of interest, we had previously shown that disruption of
either toxin-antitoxin pairs, mazef or relbe, in the e. coli hm21
and p90c strain backgrounds increased hu resistance (godoy
et al., 2006). these observations led us to ask whether the mazef
and relbe toxin/antitoxin modules contributed to the death of
hu-treated strain mc4100 via an ohd-mediated mechanism
and whether this is connected to hu-mediated replication fork
inhibition. when challenged with hu, we found that, in strain
mc4100, deletion of mazef led to increased resistance to hu
(figure 4a). the mc4100 drelbe strain, however, was indistinguishable from the parental strain for hu survival (figure 4b).
strikingly, we found that deletions of both mazef and relbe act
synergistically to promote hu resistance to levels far above
that observed in a dmazef strain alone (figure 4c) and similar
to that observed with the dcydb strain. deletion of relbe did
not have a detectable effect on ohd formation, whereas deletion
of mazef caused a small decrease in ohd formation (figures
s2d and s2e). the dmazef drelbe strain exhibited a stronger
reduction in ohd levels (figure s2f), consistent with the
observed increase in survival (figure 4c). we also note that our
microarray results showed that hu induced only small increases
in expression of mazf relative to maze and of rele relative to relb
(table 1), suggesting that hu treatment appears to be affecting
toxin activation mainly at a posttranscriptional level.
we have shown above that increased iron uptake has overall
negative effects on hu survival. to determine the relationship
between increased iron uptake and toxin-induced cell death,
we constructed a dmazef drelbe dtonb strain and tested its
sensitivity to hu. we found that our dmazef drelbe dtonb
was more resistant to hu than was our dmazef drelbe strain
(figure 4d). this suggests that increased iron uptake enhances
toxin-mediated cell death, which likely occurs via an ohddependent mechanism. consistent with these data, we found
that deleting tonb in combination with dmazef drelbe results
in a significant decrease in the levels of ohd following hu treatment (figure 4e).

toxin activity leads to improperly translated proteins
and membrane stress
we next considered how toxin activity could lead to radical-mediated cell death. a number of chromosomally encoded toxins have
functions that directly affect protein synthesis. hipa was recently
shown to phosphorylate the translation-related protein  xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx 
(schumacher et al., 2009), and the toxins mazf and rele are
ribonucleases that cleave mrna (christensen and gerdes,
2003; zhang et al., 2005), thereby disrupting protein translation.
improper protein synthesis can lead to problems with protein
folding, and this has been associated with protein carbonylation
(a marker of oxidative stress) (dukan et al., 2000) and ros formation following treatment with aminoglycosides (kohanski et al.,
2008). recent work has also shown that mazf overexpression
can lead to protein carbonylation (kolodkin-gal et al., 2008).
we hypothesized that hu stimulates mazf and rele activity,
which cleave mrna, leading to truncated proteins, protein misfolding, and, ultimately, oxidative stress and cell death.
to test this idea, we investigated protein translation following
hu treatment to determine whether replication fork inhibition
affects protein synthesis and whether such an effect is toxin
dependent. disruption of protein translation can lead to stalled
ribosomes that can be rescued by tmrna (moore and sauer,
2007). tmrna frees stalled ribosomes by releasing both mrna
and the incompletely translated protein. we used the tmrna
system developed by moore et al., which adds a 63 his peptide
tag to the end tmrna-released proteins, to monitor the effect of
toxin activity during hu treatment (moore and sauer, 2005). we
found that hu treatment induced a significant increase in tmrna
his-tagged proteins (figure 5a). this increase in tmrna histagged proteins was alleviated by deleting both toxins mazf
and rele. this suggests that toxin activity during hu treatment
likely leads to the improper translation of proteins.
improperly translated proteins can also lead to membrane
stress (alba and gross, 2004). to test whether the hu treatment
leads to membrane stress, we first used an rpohp3-lacz reporter
to measure rpoe activity following hu treatment. rpoe is a s
factor whose activity is induced by membrane stress (alba and
gross, 2004). after only 1 hr of hu treatment, we observed a
2-fold increase in rpoe activity (figure 5b). this increase in
rpoe activity was prevented by deletion of both toxins mazf
and rele, confirming that toxins stimulate envelope stress, likely
through a mechanism involving improperly translation proteins.
we were unable to assess rpoe activity at later time points
because the strain lacking both toxin-antitoxin pairs rapidly
approached stationary phase, which induces rpoe activity
(kabir et al., 2005).
to confirm that membrane stress affects hu-mediated survival, we looked at the responses of dcpxa and ddegp mutant
strains to hu treatment. disruption of membrane proteins also
leads to the activation of the cpxar two-component signaling
system (cpxa is the sensor protein, and cpxr is the cognate
transcription factor), which monitors the fidelity of proteins
trafficked across the inner membrane and works in conjunction
with se to activate elements of the envelope stress response system such as the periplasmic protease, degp (macritchie et al.,
2008; ruiz and silhavy, 2005). recent evidence suggests that
mistranslated proteins can induce ohd through cpx-mediated

perturbation of envelope stress and metabolism and that deletion of the cpxa or degp significantly decreased ohd production (kohanski et al., 2008). in agreement with this, we found
that deletion of cpxa resulted in a striking rescue from huinduced cell death (figure 5c), comparable to that achieved by
deleting cydb or mazef, relbe, and tonb. deletion of cpxa
also substantially reduced hu-induced ohd production (figure 5d). furthermore, we also observed that deletion of degp
also conferred significant resistance to hu-induced cell death
(figure 5c).
hu treatment leads to membrane depolarization
and toxin-mediated release of superoxide
if hu-induced membrane stress leads to ohd formation by disrupting the normal electron flow through the electron transport

chain, then we hypothesized that hu treatment should also
lead to changes in membrane potential. we treated cells with
the bisoxonol dye dibac, which diffuses across depolarized
yet intact cell membranes (jepras et al., 1997). we examined
cells 3 hr after hu treatment, as cell death appears to have
begun by this time (figure 1a), and observed a significant
number of dibac-stained cells (figure 5f). furthermore, we
found that only cells strongly expressing fur-regulated gfp
stained with dibac (figure 5g). this agrees with our observation
above that, overall, increased expression of iron uptake genes is
associated with hu-induced cell dysfunction.
the most common ros released from the respiratory chain is
superoxide (imlay and fridovich, 1991). our results demonstrating a connection between toxin activity and membrane
stress, together with our earlier results showing that dcydb is

substantially less sensitive to hu treatment, suggest that hu-induced changes in membrane composition and function may
lead to superoxide formation. superoxide is converted to
 xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2) that can react with  xxxd2385xxx  to
produce ohd (jakubovics and jenkinson, 2001). it is thus
possible that toxin-mediated superoxide formation can contribute to an increase in fenton chemistry, which would explain
the significant decrease in cell death in the dmazef drelbe

dtonb strain. to monitor superoxide production, we used
plasmid pl(soxs)-gpf, which expresses gfp under the control
of the superoxide-sensing regulator soxs (dwyer et al., 2007).
we observed an increase in soxs-regulated gfp expression
following hu treatment. soxs-regulated gfp expression was
significantly decreased in the dmazef drelbe mutant (figure 5h), which demonstrates that hu-mediated toxin activity
contributes to cell death via superoxide formation.

discussion
our work describes the previously unknown chain of events by
which hu-induced dna replication arrest leads to cell death.
on the basis of our findings, we propose the following mechanism whereby hu treatment results in cell death (figure 6). hu
inhibits rnr, leading to dntp depletion and an arrest of normal

dna replication (figure 6a). dntp depletion results in the activation of toxins mazf and rele. the activity of these toxins
produces improperly translated proteins, leading to membrane
stress and activation of membrane stress responses (figure 6b).
these effects alter the properties of one of the cell’s two terminal
cytochrome oxidases in the electron transport chain, causing
an increase in the production of superoxide, which is then

converted to  xxxd2298xxx  (figure 6c). the hydrogen
peroxide reacts with free  xxxd2385xxx , resulting in the formation
of ohd, which contribute to cell death (figure 6d). hu treatment
also induces a strong iron uptake response (figure 6e), which
may be part of an initial survival response to increased demand
for synthesis of the iron-utilizing class i rnr. however, due to
replication fork arrest, toxin activity, and membrane stress,
hu-induced iron uptake becomes misregulated and exacerbates ohd production (figure 6e).
our work also shows that hu initially induces cell survival
responses beyond the classic sos response. specifically, we
show that hu induces genes required for primosome formation
and downregulates genes required for cell division. induction
of primosome genes could help restart collapsed replication
forks that have resulted from hu treatment. downregulation of
cell division genes would retain all copies of the chromosome
in one compartment, thus leaving open the possibility of recombinational repair.
it is striking that hu-induced death, which takes several hours
and is preceded by specific cellular changes and is associated
with cell lysis, can be substantially prevented by adding thiourea
or by inactivating cydb, cpxa, or the combination of mazef,
relbe, and tonb. these systems appear to converge on radical
formation as a contributing element in hu-mediated cell death,
and these observations suggest that there is one predominant
mode of death for hu-treated cells, which is in contrast to cells
treated with various bactericidal antibiotics for which there are
additional modes of death besides that mediated by ohd radicals (kohanski et al., 2007).
of interest, kohanski et al. (2007) showed that treatment of
e. coli with the  xxxg2311xxx   xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor norfloxacin also induces
radical production and cell death, both of which can be partially
alleviated by thiourea. however, thiourea rescue of norfloxacininduced cell death is not as complete as it is for hu. thus, though
both hu and norfloxacin inhibit dna replication and induce lethal
radical production, radicals appear to play a more significant role
in hu-induced cell death. we believe that this difference is due to
the exact mode of replication arrest that these two compounds
elicit and how the cell interprets these modes of replication
arrest. a clue that this may be the case comes from microarray
studies that show that norfloxacin does not induce iron uptake
but does cause internal iron release by destabilizing iron-sulfur
clusters (kohanski et al., 2007). furthermore, norfloxacin-mediated radical production is not dependent on toxins, whereas
hu radical production is.
our observations establish a direct link between hu-mediated
killing and the respiratory chain (figure 6c) and suggest that,
under the stressed condition resulting from prolonged exposure
to hu, the cydab-encoded heterodimeric cytochrome bd  xxxd2299xxx 
oxidase plays a contributing role in cell death by generating
superoxide. the involvement of this particular cytochrome in
hu-mediated cell death is intriguing. typically, cytoplasmic
superoxide is not generated by the action of cytochrome oxidases (imlay, 2003), and both cytochrome bd and cytochrome
bo3 have molecular features that prevent the release of incompletely reduced oxygen as superoxide (tsubaki et al., 2000).
nevertheless, our results suggest that, under conditions of hu
stress, cytochrome bd oxidase switches from a protective role

to a diametrically opposite role of promoting cell death by
producing superoxide. from this perspective, it is intriguing
that the d heme, which binds the o2, is only found in this enzyme
(dueweke and gennis, 1991).
another unique feature of cytochrome bd oxidase is that its
most prominent stable form is the one-electron reduced oxy
state (fe2+-o2) in which oxygen is at the level of superoxide
(belevich et al., 2005; lorence and gennis, 1989; yang et al.,
2008). thus, it is possible that some modification of the cytochrome bd oxidase under conditions of prolonged hu stress
could alter its function so that it becomes a producer of superoxide. such a modification of function could result from a proteolytic cleavage in the stressed cells, perhaps in its protease-sensitive periplasmic loops (dueweke and gennis, 1991), in a manner
reminiscent of the cleavage of rsea by degs in response to
envelope stress, or in a membrane-spanning domain by rsep
(ades, 2008). other possibilities include c-terminal truncation
by translation of an incomplete message, posttranslation modification, or modulation of the native enzyme by other components present in the stressed cell envelopes. such alterations
could, for example, potentially interfere with the efficiency of
electron transfer from ubiquinol to the o2-binding d heme or
change the status of the putative o2 channel that has been
postulated to flicker between open and closed conformations
under normal conditions (belevich et al., 2007). the clustering
of cytochrome bd oxidase in mobile patches in the membrane
(lenn et al., 2008) might have the effect of speeding up killing
by concentrating hydroxyl radical production in particular
regions of the cell.
toxin/antitoxin modules are found both on plasmids and on
bacterial chromosomes. it is widely accepted that the toxin/antitoxin pairs located on plasmids serve as ‘‘addiction’’ modules by
killing bacteria that have lost the plasmid (couturier et al., 1998;
engelberg-kulka et al., 2006; gerdes et al., 2005; hayes, 2003;
jensen and gerdes, 1995). there is evidence suggesting that
toxin/antitoxin modules serve as growth modulators that help
bacterial cells to manage a variety of physiological stresses
(buts et al., 2005; gerdes et al., 2005). the proposal that chromosomally encoded ta pairs may mediate cell death in
response to certain stresses has proven to be controversial
(engelberg-kulka et al., 2006; gerdes et al., 2005; kolodkingal and engelberg-kulka, 2006; magnuson, 2007; saavedra
de bast et al., 2008; tsilibaris et al., 2007).
a recent study has shown that mazef-mediated cell death
appears to occur via ros-dependent and independent mechanisms, which depends on the production of a density-dependent
pentapeptide extracellular death factor (edf) (kolodkin-gal
et al., 2008). furthermore, it has been suggested that the
commonly used e. coli strain mg1655 is largely resistant to
mazef-mediated killing because it fails to produce the edf
and responds very poorly to it (kolodkin-gal and engelbergkulka, 2008). although the killing that results from hu exposure
is mediated, in part, by mazef, it differs from the mazef-mediated killing discussed above in two important respects. first,
we found that hu-induced cell death is independent of culture
density (figure s3a), indicating that activation of hu-induced
cell death responses may not require the pentapeptide extracellular death factor described by kolodkin-gal and colleagues

hu-induced ohd production in e. coli

(kolodkin-gal et al., 2007). second, we found that hu induces
cell death and lysis in strains mc4100 and mg1655 with similar
kinetics (figure s3b). our results suggest that, although hu
induces cell death responses that are at least partially dependent
on toxin activation, these responses are complex (figure 6) and
quite different from those previously studied (saavedra de bast
et al., 2008; tsilibaris et al., 2007).
the mechanism by which hu-mediated dntp depletion activates the mazf and rele toxins and causes envelope stress is
not yet clear. we hypothesize that hu-dependent depletion of
dntps and subsequent replication fork arrest lead to gaps in
the dna that interrupt transcription and subsequent translation
of several genes, including toxin/antitoxin pairs. because antitoxins are more labile than their toxin counterparts are (buts
et al., 2005; engelberg-kulka et al., 2006), inhibition of transcription and translation could lead to rapid loss of antitoxin and activation of toxin. possible support for this hypothesis comes from
our previous observation that certain umuc mutations, such as
umuc122::tn5, permit dna pol iv (dinb) and dna pol v
(umud0 2c) to carry out limited mutagenic dna synthesis that
makes cells resistant to killing by hu (godoy et al., 2006). the
kms of dna pol iv and pol v for dntps are strikingly lower
than those for the replicative dna polymerase, explaining why
they can act in dntp-depleted cells (godoy et al., 2006). this
limited dna synthesis presumably stabilizes the replication
fork by filling in gaps that would otherwise accumulate under
low-dntp conditions.
in this work, we used a systems-level approach to examine the
transcriptional response of e. coli following hu treatment and, in
doing so, expanded our understanding of the events following
hu-mediated rnr inhibition and replication fork arrest. we
have explored the protective responses induced by hu treatment as well as responses that are important for cell death, and
we implicate toxin-antitoxins, envelope stress, cytochromes,
and iron misregulation as key players in an hu-mediated, free
radical-based cell death pathway (figure 6). moving forward, it
will be interesting to determine whether the cell death mechanism that we propose in this work extends past hu inhibition
to encompass replication inhibition in general.

mc4100 was grown to exponential phase. three independent cultures were

and microarray analysis were performed as described (dwyer et al., 2007).
results are reported as the average ± standard error (se).
the resulting microarray *.cel files were combined with *.cel files from

with rmaexpress for a total of 530 rma-normalized e. coli expression arrays.
each gene’s sd of expression, s, was calculated across the entire compendium and used to construct the z scale difference between that gene’s
normalized expression following hydroxyurea treatment versus the untreated
control:
dzexp =

xexp  xctl
s

this allowed us to measure each gene’s change in expression for a given
experiment in units of sd, a form of the z test. we used a two-tier z score cutoff
platform to identify statistical significance gene expression changes. genes
with a z score of > +2 or < 2 were scored as highly significant, and genes
with z scores between +1 and +2 or between 1 and 2 were scored as significant. as described in the manuscript, we tested candidate genes that showed
statistically significant gene expression changes from our microarray analysis
for biological significance in response to hu treatment.

hydroxyurea, guanazole, and temperature sensitivity assays
liquid culture assays were performed as described (godoy et al., 2006). exponentially growing cultures were diluted to od600 0.01 or 0.0001 prior to treatment. where indicated, hu, guanazole, and thiourea were added to 100 mm
for liquid culture assays. for temperature sensitivity assays, exponentially
growing cultures were diluted to od600 0.01 and then shifted to the nonpermissive temperate. for chronic assays, strains were serially diluted and plated on
lb agar containing increasing amounts of hu. cfu were counted after 24 hr
growth at 37 c. we required 100 mm hu to observe significant cell death in
liquid culture and between 5 mm and 30 mm to observe significant cell death
in plating assays. this is due the decreased stability of hu of liquid culture (s.t.
lovett, personal communication).

protein lysates, immunoblots, and lacz assays
at least three independent cultures were grown to mid-log with or without
100 mm hu for 1 hr. cultures were lysed by bead beater. immunoblotting
was performed as previously described (robichon et al., 2005), loading equal
amounts of protein lysate for each sample. relative protein expression levels
were quantitated using a fluorchem hd2 imaging system (alpha innotech
corp.) and expressed as the average ± se. lacz assays were performed as
previously described (sambrook and russell, 2001).

microscopy and flow cytometry analysis
strains were grown to exponential phase, diluted, and grown for 1 hr with or
without 100 mm hu. preparation of cells for live-cell microscopy was done
essentially as described (godoy et al., 2006). flow cytometry analysis was performed as described (dwyer et al., 2007). flow cytometry experiments
measured the entire population of cells, and all plots represent analysis of
an equal number of cells (r 50,000 cells). the relative fluorescence values
were determined by taking the mean fluorescence value for each sample at
each time point and normalizing that value to the maximum mean fluorescence
value that the wild-type sample achieved over the time course. each data point
represents the average of three independent measurements of these relative
fluorescence values, and the error bars represent se of the independent
measurements. hydroxyl radical formation was measured by 30 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (hpf; molecular probes). an example of the side scatter
and forward scatter for one experiment measuring hpf fluorescence is shown
in figure s4. cell death was measured using  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (molecular
probes). cell membrane depolarization was monitored using dibac4
(molecular probes).
