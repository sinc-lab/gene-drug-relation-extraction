background and purpose: voltage-operated sodium channels constitute major target sites for local anaesthetic-like action.
the clinical use of local anaesthetics is still limited by severe side effects, in particular, arrhythmias and convulsions. these side
effects render the search for new local anaesthetics a matter of high interest.
experimental approach: we have investigated the effects of three halogenated structural analogues of propofol on voltageoperated human skeletal muscle sodium channels ( xxxg2026xxx ) and the effect of one compound (4-chloropropofol) on neuronal
sodium channels ( xxxg2022xxx ) heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293.
key results: 4-iodo-, 4-bromo- and 4-chloropropofol reversibly suppressed depolarization-induced whole-cell sodium inward
currents with high potency. the ic50 for block of resting channels at 150 mv was 2.3, 3.9 and 11.3 mm in  xxxg2026xxx ,
respectively, and 29.2 mm for 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx . membrane depolarization inducing inactivation strongly increased
the blocking potency of all compounds. estimated affinities for the fast-inactivated channel state were 81 nm, 312 nm and
227 nm for 4-iodopropofol, 4-bromopropofol and 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2026xxx , and 450 nm for 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx .
recovery from fast inactivation was prolonged in the presence of drug leading to an accumulation of block during repetitive
stimulation at high frequencies (100 hz).
conclusions and implications: halogenated propofol analogues constitute a novel class of sodium channel-blocking drugs
possessing almost 100-fold higher potency compared with the local anaesthetic and anti-arrhythmic drug lidocaine.
preferential drug binding to inactivated channel states suggests that halogenated propofol analogues might be especially
effective in suppressing ectopic discharges in a variety of pathological conditions.

introduction
voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the
increased sodium permeability during the rapid rising phase
of the action potential. as mediators of membrane excitability, they represent important target sites for local
anaesthetic, anti-epileptic and anti-arrhythmic drugs, which
are known to block sodium channels in a voltage-dependent

manner with higher affinity to inactivated conformations of
the channel (bean et al., 1983; balser et al., 1996b;
vedantham and cannon, 1999).
we have shown previously that the block of sodium
channels by 2,6-dimethylphenol, a structural analogue of
the aromatic alcohol and anaesthetic propofol on the one
hand and the aromatic tail of lidocaine-like local anaesthetics on the other, mimics important features of sodium
channel blockade by its parent compounds (haeseler et al.,
2002). recent molecular modelling studies involving
several analogues of the local anaesthetic  xxxd305xxx  have
raised the hypothesis that the substituted benzene ring

containing a functionally active group capable of binding a
na þ ion (and thus mimicking the ammonium group of a
charged local anaesthetic) constitutes the effective principle
of local anaesthetic molecules because it determines their
interaction with amino-acid residues critical for local
anaesthetic binding in a hydrophobic cavity on the s6
segment of domain 4 in voltage-operated human skeletal
muscle sodium channels ( xxxg2026xxx ) (tikhonov et al., 2006;
godwin et al., 2005). thus, it seems likely that phenol
derivatives and  xxxd305xxx  analogues act via a common
local anaesthetic receptor site. modelling the interaction of
 xxxd305xxx  analogues with their binding cavity has revealed
that an increase in alkylation increases hydrophobic
interactions and thus enhances the fit within the local
anaesthetic binding cavity (godwin et al., 2005). in accordance with these observations, we could show that an
increase in c-chain length in the 2,6 positions of the
phenolic hydroxyl group from methyl (2,6-dimethylphenol)
(haeseler et al., 2002) to isopropyl (propofol) (haeseler et al.,
2001b) and tertbutyl (2,6-di-tert-butylphenol) (haeseler and
leuwer, 2003) groups increased blocking potency of the
respective phenol derivative, although, in the case of 2,6di-tert-butylphenol, the bulkier side chains almost prevented
reversibility of block. of all these phenol derivatives, the
anaesthetic propofol was the most potent non-halogenated
reversible blocker of sodium inward currents. consequently,
based on our previous observation that halogenation of an
aliphatic phenolic blocker induces a strong increase in
potency while retaining reversibility during washout
(haeseler et al., 2001a), we synthesized three halogenated
structural analogues of propofol with the hypothesis that
halogenated propofol analogues might constitute a novel
class of highly potent sodium channel blockers. preliminary
results have shown that these structural analogues of
propofol block sodium inward currents in rat ventricular
myocytes with high potency (bracken et al., 2006). the aim
of this study was to characterize the interaction of 4-iodo-,
4-bromo- and 4-chloropropofol (figure 1) with heterologously
expressed  xxxg2026xxx  and, additionally, the effect of one of the
compounds (4-chloropropofol) on rat brain sodium channels
( xxxg2022xxx ) in vitro.

materials and methods
transfection and cell culture
stably transfected human embryonic kidney cell lines 293
expressing the a-subunit of either human skeletal muscle
( xxxg2026xxx ) or rat brain type iia ( xxxg2022xxx ) sodium channels were
a gift from professor lehmann–horn (ulm, germany). ion
channel nomenclature conforms to the guide to receptors
and channels (alexander et al., 2008). the expression vector
prc/cmv (invitrogen, san diego, ca, usa) was used for
mammalian transfection (mitrovic et al., 1994). transfection
was performed using calcium phosphate precipitation
(graham and van der eb, 1973). permanent expression was
achieved by selection for resistance to the aminoglycoside
antibiotic  xxxd2191xxx   xxxg418xxx  (life technology, eggenstein,
germany) (mitrovic et al., 1994). successful channel
expression was verified electrophysiologically. a-subunits of
skeletal muscle and neuronal sodium channels show normal
gating characteristics (with respect to experiments in native
tissue) when expressed in a mammalian cell line in the
absence of the b-subunit (chahine et al., 1994; sarkar et al.,
1995).

solutions
4-iodopropofol, 4-bromopropofol and 4-chloropropofol (for
structures, see figure 1) were synthesized by braun melsungen, germany. the compounds were prepared as 1 m stock
solution in ethanol and stored at 20 1c. the stock solution
was dissolved directly in bath solution immediately before
the experiments. drug-containing vials were vigorously
vortexed for 60 min. the solution was applied via a
glass–polytetrafluoroethylene perfusion system and a stainless steel superfusion pipette. the bath solution contained
[mm] nacl 140, mgcl2 1.0, kcl 4.0, cacl2 2.0, hepes 5.0,
dextrose 5.0. patch electrodes contained [mm] cscl2 130,
mgcl2 2.0, egta 5.0, hepes 10. all solutions were adjusted
to 290 mosm l1 by the addition of mannitol and to ph 7.4
by the addition of cs(oh)2. in the concentration range
tested in this study, the diluent ethanol has no effect on
sodium channels (haeseler et al., 2001b).

electrophysiology
standard whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments (hamill
et al., 1981) were performed at 20 1c. each experiment
consisted of test recordings with the drug present at only one
concentration, and of drug-free control recordings before
and after the test. each cell was exposed to one test
concentration only. at least four independent experiments
were performed at each concentration.
for data acquisition and further analysis, we used the epc9
digitally controlled amplifier in combination with pulse and
pulse fit software (heka electronics, lambrecht, germany).
the epc9 provides automatic subtraction of capacitive and
leakage currents by means of a prepulse protocol. the data
were filtered  xxxd1891xxx  khz and digitized at 20 ms per point. the
input resistance of the patch pipettes was 2.0–3.5 mo and
the capacitances of the cells were 9–15 pf; the residual
series resistance (after 50% compensation) was 1.2–2.5 mo.

experiments with a rise in series resistance were rejected. to
minimize time-dependent shifts in the voltage dependence
of steady-state inactivation (wang et al., 1996), all test
experiments were performed within 5 min of patch rupture.
under these experimental conditions, time-dependent
hyperpolarizing shifts in control conditions were less than
2 mv (haeseler et al., 2000).
drug effects on the peak current amplitude were assessed
at a holding potential close to the normal resting potential of
muscle in physiological conditions (70 mv) (hodgkin and
horowicz, 1959), and at hyperpolarized membrane potentials (150 and 100 mv). the residual sodium current
(i/imax) in the presence of drug (with respect to the current
elicited with the same protocol in the respective control
experiment) obtained with the different protocols was
plotted against the applied concentration of the drug [c].
the averaged data were fitted using the hill equation
(equation 1) yielding the concentration for half-maximum
channel blockade (ic50) and the hill coefficient nh.

the voltage dependence of the block and the affinity for
depolarized channel states was further assessed by applying a
double-pulse protocol. currents elicited by test pulses (itest),
starting from varying prepulse potentials (from 150 to
5 mv), normalized to the current elicited at the most
hyperpolarized prepotential (150 mv), represent the relative fraction of channels that have not been inactivated
during the 100 ms inactivating prepulse. boltzmann fits to
the resulting current–voltage plots yield the membrane
potential at half-maximum channel availability (v0.5) and
the slope factor k, reflecting the ‘voltage sensitivity’ of
inactivation gating (see equation 2).

in control conditions, the parameters of the boltzmann fits
reflect the voltage-dependence of the distribution between
resting and fast-inactivated channels (the availability curve).
in the presence of drug, the steady-state availability curve
reflects drug association with rested and fast-inactivated
channels. the conformational change induced by channel
inactivation may increase the binding affinity for a sodium
channel-blocking agent—the modulated receptor model for
local anaesthetic action (hille, 1992). drug binding to
inactivated channels is hardly accessible to a direct experimental approach, because inactivated channel states and all
drug-bound channel states are unavailable on depolarization. a model-dependent method is generally applied to
determine the affinity to fast-inactivated channel states.
tighter binding of the drug to fast-inactivated channels
compared with resting channels—a typical feature of sodium
channel blockade by lidocaine-like local anaesthetics—
increases the fraction of unavailable channels at depolarized
membrane potentials by more than just the sum of channel
inactivation at a given membrane potential and block of the
remaining resting channels at the respective membrane
potential (hille, 1992). this membrane-potential-dependent

267

increase in the fraction of unavailable channels is revealed
by a negative voltage shift dv0.5 in the channel availability
curve that shows concentration dependence. the modeldependent assessment of the affinity to fast-inactivated
channels is based on this concentration-dependence of the
shift in the availability curve (bean et al., 1983; leuwer et al.,
2004). the underlying assumption is that the higher amount
of channel blockade achieved with consecutive membrane
depolarization is determined by the distribution of channels
between resting and fast-inactivated states along the voltage
axis (that is, the channel availability curve) and by the
different binding affinities of the blocking drug for the two
channel states. the voltage shift dv0.5 in the presence of a
drug would depend upon the drug concentration [c],
according to equation 3 (leuwer et al., 2004). a fit of the
model to dv0.5 plotted against concentration yields estimates for the concentration for half-maximum effect on fastinactivated channels eci50 and the hill-type coefficient for
drug binding to inactivated channels n:

k and ecr50 are entered as constant factors. k is the slope
factor of the availability curve in the controls and ecr50 is
the concentration for half-maximum effect on resting
channels, obtained at 150 mv holding potential.
after inactivation, channel reopening is impossible until
the channels recover from inactivation, a process that
requires several ms after membrane repolarization. further
information about drug effects on the kinetics of drug
dissociation from the fast-inactivated state can be derived
from the rate at which the channels recover from inactivation in the presence of the drug and from the accumulation
of block during trains of repetitive pulses (use-dependent
block). the time of membrane repolarization required to
remove fast inactivation was assessed at 100 mv by a twopulse protocol, with varying time intervals (up to 100 ms)
between the inactivating prepulse and the test pulse. the
time constants of recovery, trec, were derived from biexponential fits to the fractional current after recovery from
inactivation, plotted against the time interval between the
inactivating prepulse and the test pulse (equation 4).

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed to reveal a potential
difference in potency between the compounds in  xxxg2026xxx  at a
hyperpolarized holding potential (150 mv). curve fitting
and parameter estimation of the hill curves were performed
using the program ‘proc nlmixed’ of sas release 8.02. in
this model, the ‘experiment’ is treated as the subject variable
and the parameter values (ic50 and nh) are treated as normally
distributed random factors. the mean differences of these

parameters between the three compounds were entered into
the common model as fixed shift parameters dic50 and dnh,
activated for all data of the second data set. the corresponding
(asymptotic) t-value was used to test the null hypothesis of no
parameter difference against the two-sided alternative. the
null hypothesis was rejected at po0.05.

block achieved depended on the holding potential from
which the depolarization was started. the respective ic50
values were reduced to 0.2, 1.0 and 1.4 mm ( xxxg2026xxx ) and
5.5 mm (4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx  ) at 70 mv holding
potential. at a strongly hyperpolarized potential (150 mv;
figure 2) where all channels are in the resting state, the
respective ic50 values were 2.3, 3.9 and 11.3 mm ( xxxg2026xxx ) and
29.2 (4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx ). 4-chloropropofol was
significantly less potent at 150 mv than 4-iodopropofol
(p ¼ 0.0008) and 4-bromopropofol (p ¼ 0.0058); the difference between 4-iodopropofol and 4-bromopropofol did not
reach statistical significance (p ¼ 0.076). calculated values
for the hill coefficients nh ranged between 0.7 and 1.0; no
significant differences in hill coefficients were detected
between the compounds.

results
resting state affinity
we studied a total of 243 cells. average currents in the
control experiments following depolarization from 150 mv
to 0 mv were 2.8±1.2 na in  xxxg2026xxx  (n ¼ 102) and
2.5±1.3 na in  xxxg2022xxx  (n ¼ 77). maximum inward currents
elicited by 10 ms pulses from either 150, 100 or 70 mv
to 0 mv were suppressed by all compounds in the low mm
range. a steady state of sodium channel blockade at a given
concentration was reached during 60 s of drug application;
however, recovery of sodium inward current during washout
was incomplete. peak inward currents following drug
application in concentrations higher than the respective
ec50 for block reached 70–80% of the control values during
the 3–5 min washout period.
residual sodium inward currents (with respect to control)
in the presence of drug derived from at least five different
experiments for each drug concentration were averaged to
establish concentration–response plots. hill fits to the
averaged data yielded an ic50 value of 0.8, 2.5 and 6.9 mm
at 100 mv holding potential for 4-iodopropofol, 4-bromopropofol and 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2026xxx , respectively, and
of 22.0 mm for 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx . the amount of

inactivated state affinity
the increase in blocking potency at a holding potential of
70 mv, at which a fraction of the channels is inactivated,
compared with 150 mv, at which all channels are expected
to be in the resting state, suggests that the amount of block
achieved by all compounds depends on the membrane
potential and increases as the proportion of inactivated
channels increases with respect to resting channels.
the increase in blocking potency achieved with consecutive membrane depolarization was further assessed using a
double pulse protocol with 100 ms prepulses to depolarized
membrane potentials before the test pulse (see materials and
methods section; figures 3 and 4). in control conditions, half
of the channels were unavailable at 65.8±5.9 mv ( xxxg2026xxx )
and 51.6±5.0 mv ( xxxg2022xxx ) because of fast inactivation.

the slope factor k was 7.2±1.0 ( xxxg2026xxx ) and 7.1±0.6

the current amplitude in 3 mm concentrations of 4-chloro-,
4-bromo- and 4-iodopropofol, respectively, in the skeletal
muscle isoform and 1 and 10% of the current amplitude in 3
and 10 mm 4-chloropropofol in the neuronal isoform (figures
5a and b). the fast time constants trec1 were increased to
6.2±1.0 ms in 3 and 10 mm 4-chloropropofol in the neuronal
isoform and to 4.6 ± 1.3, 5.7±1.5 and 15.8±7 ms in 3 mm
concentrations of 4-chloro-, 4-bromo- and 4-jodopropofol,
respectively, in the skeletal muscle isoform. this means that
recovery from inactivated channel block at a hyperpolarized
holding potential (100 mv) should be too fast to accumulate frequency-dependent block at a stimulating frequency
lower than 10 hz.
the accumulation of block during trains of depolarizing
pulses suggests that the interval between pulses is too short
to allow recovery of sodium channel availability. frequencydependent block was defined as the additional reduction in
sodium current for the last pulse relative to the first pulse in
a test train in the presence of drug. at 100 mv, frequencydependent block during 10 hz trains was o5% for all
compounds at concentrations below the ic50 for block of
resting channels. however, during 100 hz trains at 100 mv,
the additional fall relative to the first pulse was 27, 13 and
9% in the presence of 30, 10 and 3 mm 4-chloropropofol in

fits to the fractional current after recovery from inactivation,
plotted against the time interval between the inactivating

obtained for the neuronal and the skeletal muscle isoform

current derived from seven different experiments, elicited by a 4 ms test pulse to 0 mv, following a 100 ms inactivating prepulse from 150 mv
to the indicated prepulse potential. currents were normalized to maximum value (in each series at 150 mv pre-potential); solid lines
represent the best boltzmann fit (equation 2, materials and methods section) to the data. the indicated errors are standard deviations. in the
presence of drug, currents were normalized either to maximum value in the presence of drug (filled symbols) or to maximum value in the
controls (empty symbols). vertical arrows illustrate the increase in peak current suppression induced by the test drug at more depolarized
potentials compared with 150 mv prepulse potential. this increase in the peak current suppression induced by the test drug at more
depolarized prepulse potentials results in a voltage shift in the midpoints of the availability curve (dv0.5) illustrated by the vertical arrows. this
voltage shift is concentration dependent; the concentration dependence of this effect is depicted in figure 4. (b) the effects of 1 mm 4iodopropofol, 3 mm 4-bromopropofol or 10 mm 4-chloropropofol on steady-state availability curves in  xxxg2026xxx  sodium channels, assessed by a

discussion
the main result of this study is that, in line with our
hypothesis, the insertion of a halogen in the para-position to
the phenolic hydroxyl group of the propofol molecule yields
compounds with very high potency to block voltagebritish journal of pharmacology (2008) 155 265–275

operated sodium channels in a local-anaesthetic-like manner. the in vitro potency of halogenated propofols to block
sodium channels is much higher than that of any local
anaesthetic in clinical use at the present time, for example,
almost 100-fold higher when compared with the local
anaesthetic lidocaine (fan et al., 1996), and about 20-fold
higher when compared with the parent compound propofol
(haeseler et al., 2001b). the ic50 for block of skeletal muscle
sodium channels in the resting state reported for lidocaine is
460 mm (fan et al., 1996; leuwer et al., 2004). our study
shows that halogenated propofol analogues block skeletal

shifts in the midpoints (dv0.5) of the steady-state availability plots relative to the starting values (from top to bottom) for
4-iodo, 4-bromo- and 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2026xxx , and for 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx , respectively. each symbol represents the mean
value derived from at least four different experiments each, error bars are standard deviations. the solid line is a least-squares fit of equation 3
(materials and methods section) to the averaged data. parameters inserted as constant factors into the equation are printed in italics, the slope
factor k was derived from boltzmann fits to the control data and the ecr50 is derived from concentration–response curves at 150 mv. the
estimated concentrations for half-maximum effect on inactivated channels (eci50) derived from that fit were 81, 312 and 227 nm for
4-iodopropofol, 4-bromopropofol and 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2026xxx , respectively, and 450 nm for 4-chloropropofol in  xxxg2022xxx . the hill

muscle sodium channels in the single-digit mm range at a
potential close to the normal resting potential (70 mv) and
in the nm range when channels are in fast-inactivated
channel states. all propofol analogues showed a marked
increase in affinity at depolarized membrane potentials,

revealed by a 20- to 40-fold lower half-maximum effect
concentration in inactivated channels compared with resting channels. this strong voltage dependency of the block
seen with all halogenated propofol analogues is a prominent
feature of a local anaesthetic-like action, in general (bean
british journal of pharmacology (2008) 155 265–275

et al., 1983; fan et al., 1996; balser et al., 1996b; scheuer,
1999). the difference in potency between inactivated and
resting channels is even greater for the propofol analogues
than for lidocaine. for lidocaine, we have previously found
an eci50 of 67 mm and an ecr50 of 417 mm applying the same
modified model to assess inactivated state binding used in
this study (leuwer et al., 2004). tighter binding to inactivated channels and stabilization of inactivated states is a
common principle by which local anaesthetic-like compounds target membranes with altered functional expression
of voltage-gated sodium channels at doses far below those
that block normal nerve and muscle impulse propagation
(rogawski and löscher, 2004; bräu et al., 2001; jurkat-rott
et al., 2002; lai et al., 2004; amir et al., 2006); wang et al.,
2004). it is noteworthy that halogenated propofol analogues
dissociate much faster from inactivated channel states than
lidocaine. in the presence of lidocaine, the time constants of
recovery are prolonged by around 100-fold compared with
normal recovery from inactivation resulting in a pronounced
use-dependent block even at low stimulating frequencies
(bean et al., 1983; vedantham and cannon, 1999). halogenated propofol analogues stabilize inactivation revealed by a
moderate (around 10-fold) prolongation of recovery from
fast inactivation, which results in an accumulation of block
during repetitive depolarizations only when applied at high
frequencies (x100 hz). both inflammatory and neuropathic

pain conditions and sodium channel myopathies are
associated with increased responsiveness to a spectrum of
stimuli or spontaneous firing due to altered function or
expression pattern of sodium channels (waxman and hains,
2006; jurkat-rott et al., 2002; amir et al., 2006). highfrequency electrical discharges that may result from ectopic
activity at the site of a nerve injury or infarcted area are
especially sensitive to lidocaine-like local anaesthetic and
anti-epileptic drugs. for example, systemic lidocaine silences
ectopic discharge patterns at the site of an experimental
nerve injury and in axotomized dorsal root ganglion cells at
doses that leave normal impulse propagation unaffected
(devor et al., 1992). the strong dependence of blocking
potency on the kinetic state of the channel along with rapid
drug dissociation from inactivated channels hypothetically
makes the halogenated propofol analogues useful candidates
for selectively suppressing pathological ectopic discharges in
damaged tissues with fewer systemic side effects. this
approach might be an interesting perspective in the treatment of certain pain conditions, myotonias or cardiac
arrhythmias arising from ectopic discharge patterns in
damaged tissues.
as has been shown earlier using the example of phenol
and aniline (zamponi and french, 1993), the interaction
with voltage-operated sodium channels does not necessarily
require the unsubstituted phenolic hydroxyl group. in

the first trace (control and washout) and the first and the last three traces in the presence of 4-chloropropofol out of a series of 10
depolarizations from 100 to 0 mv applied at 100 hz. the current traces show a moderate use dependence of the effect of 4-chloropropofol
revealed by an increase in the blocking effect from the first pulse to the last pulse of approximately 10% in 10 mm 4-chloropropofol (right row of
traces). lower panel: prolongation of recovery from sodium channel inactivation induced by 4-chloropropofol assessed by a two-pulse protocol
at 100 mv membrane potential in  xxxg2022xxx  in the controls and in the presence of either 3 mm (left diagram) or 10 mm (right diagram) 4chloropropofol. the diagrams show the mean fractional current after recovery (ordinate) from five experiments each, plotted against the
recovery time interval between inactivating prepulse and test pulse (abscissa) on a logarithmic scale. error bars are standard deviations. filled
triangles represent the recovered current in the presence of drug normalized to the prepulse current in the presence of drug; empty triangles
represent the recovered current in the presence of drug normalized to the prepulse current in the controls. solid lines are exponential fits
(equation 4) to the data yielding the respective time constants of recovery trec. 4-chloropropofol induces a prolonged recovery from

concentrations of 4-iodopropofol (top), 4-bromopropofol (bottom, left) and 4-chloropropofol (bottom, right) at 100 mv membrane

recovery time interval between inactivating prepulse and test pulse (abscissa) on a logarithmic scale. error bars are standard deviations. filled
triangles represent the recovered current in the presence of drug normalized to the prepulse current in the presence of drug, empty triangles
represent the recovered current in the presence of drug normalized to the prepulse current in the controls. solid lines are exponential fits
(equation 4) to the data yielding the respective time constants of recovery trec. all compounds prolong recovery from inactivation in  xxxg2026xxx .
the insets show representative current traces showing the first trace out of a series of 10 in the absence of drug (control and washout) and the
first and the last three traces in the presence of 3 mm 4-chloropropofol. the current traces show a moderate use dependence of the blocking
effect of 4-chloropropofol during 100 hz trains revealed by an additional fall in the last pulse relative to the first pulse in the presence of drug of
around 15%.

contrast, the substitution of this functionally active group at
the benzene ring has important implications for additional
effects of the compounds on different ion channels and
receptors. although local anaesthetics and phenol derivatives both block voltage-operated sodium channels, they
differ profoundly in their effects on the major receptor for
inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain, the
 xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa) receptor. local anaesthetics
like lidocaine,  xxxd383xxx , procaine,  xxxd305xxx  and
cocaine inhibit gaba-induced currents, a mechanism that
might underlie their cns toxicity and thus determine their
side-effect profile (hara et al., 1995; ye et al., 1997; sugimoto
et al., 2000).

in contrast, 2,6-dimethylphenol and a series of other
phenol derivatives, in particular propofol, potentiate currents elicited by low concentrations of gaba and activate
cl currents through gabaa receptors in the absence
of gaba (trapani et al., 1998; krasowski et al., 2001;
mohammadi et al., 2001). this effect, which is supposed to
cause the sedative properties of phenol derivatives in vivo
(krasowski et al., 2001; jurd et al., 2003), strongly depends on
the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor properties of the phenolic hydroxyl group (trapani et al., 1998). consequently, it
is reasonable to assume that local anaesthetics based on
phenol derivatives would potentially lack some of the sideeffect profile of lidocaine-like local anaesthetics. however,

one major concern is that, in principle, all phenol derivatives
with gaba agonist properties might induce anaesthesia
when injected intravenously in very high concentrations. a
previous study showed that 4-iodopropofol, in contrast to
propofol, did not produce general anaesthesia following
intraperitoneal injection, but possessed marked anti-seizure
and anti-conflict activity in rats (sanna et al., 1999). a
subsequent study partly challenged the hypothesis of a
distinct pharmacological profile of 4-iodopropofol, showing
that 4-iodopropofol produced anaesthesia in rats following
intravenous administration of very high doses (lingamaneni
et al., 2001). the molar potency of 4-iodopropofol to
produce anaesthesia after intravenous injection was sixfold
lower than that of propofol, and the fact that all animals
survived these large doses of 4-iodopropofol suggests a broad
therapeutic range with regard to cardiovascular collapse.
furthermore, the observation of anti-convulsant and anticonflict effects of 4-iodopropofol—accompanied by inhibition of hippocampal acetylcholine release measured by
microdialysis in vivo (sanna et al., 1999)—after intraperitoneal injection in the absence of general anaesthesia strongly
suggests that these effects are extremely sensitive to low,
sub-anaesthetic concentrations of 4-iodopropofol. the next
logical steps in the development of these compounds will
have to include in vivo studies in animals assessing the ability
of the compounds to produce regional nerve block, their
anti-nociceptive and anti-arrhythmic properties and their
toxicity profile.
in summary, our study shows that halogenated propofol
analogues constitute a novel class of high-affinity sodium
channel-blocking drugs. of particular importance is the fact
that channel inactivation substantially increases binding
affinity of halogenated propofols as revealed by halfmaximum effect concentrations in the nm range. this
distinct pharmacological profile in vitro might translate into
a distinct advantageous pharmacological profile in vivo with
an emphasis on local anaesthetic, analgesic, anti-spasmodic,
anti-arrhythmic and anti-convulsant effects. owing to the
fact that halogenated propofol analogues in low concentrations certainly do not exhibit gabaa receptor antagonistic
properties, they may help to address a long-standing
clinically important problem: the pro-convulsive side effects
of lidocaine-like local anaesthetics.
