purpose: to study the effects of 3 prostaglandin analogs,  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx , on
aqueous dynamics in the same subjects and to compare techniques of assessing outflow facility.
design: experimental study (double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized paired comparison, 4-period
crossover).
participants: thirty healthy adult subjects.
methods:  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , or a placebo was administered to the left eye once a day in
the evening for 7 days, after a minimum 4-week washout period between each session. tonographic outflow
facility was measured by schiøtz tonography and pneumatonography on day 7. on day 8, the aqueous humor
flow rate and fluorophotometric outflow facility were measured by fluorophotometry. uveoscleral outflow was
calculated from the aqueous humor flow rate and outflow facility using the goldmann equation.
main outcome measures: facility of outflow, aqueous humor flow rate, intraocular pressure (iop), and
calculation of uveoscleral outflow.
results: all medications lowered iop relative to a placebo. none of the drugs affected aqueous humor
production. all medications increased outflow facility compared with placebo when measured by schiøtz and
2-minute pneumatonography (pⱕ0.02); the apparent increase of outflow facility measured with fluorophotometry
and 4-minute pneumatonography did not reach statistical significance. in contrast, uveoscleral outflow was
significantly increased by all medications when calculated from 4-minute pneumatonography data, and fluorophotometry and schiøtz data at higher episcleral venous pressures. the apparent increase found with 2-minute
pneumatonography did not reach statistical significance. these differing results in the same patients indicate that
differences in measurement techniques, and not differences in mechanism of action, explain previous conflicting
published reports on the mechanism of action of the prostaglandins.
conclusions:  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx  have similar mechanisms of action. all 3 drugs reduce
iop without significantly affecting the aqueous production rate. all drugs increase aqueous humor outflow, either by
enhancing the pressure-sensitive (presumed trabecular) outflow pathway or by increasing the pressure-insensitive
(uveoscleral) outflow, but the assessment of the amount of flow through each pathway depends upon the measurement technique. ophthalmology 2008;115:790 –795 © 2008 by the american academy of ophthalmology.

lim et al 䡠 mechanism of prostaglandins
the mechanism of action and relative clinical efficacy of the
3 compounds.6 – 8 in monkeys, prostaglandin f2␣,  xxxd2446xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx  increase calculated uveoscleral outflow but not pressure-sensitive flow (usually considered
trabecular outflow).10,11 in humans, both  xxxd2446xxx  and
 xxxd340xxx  increase calculated uveoscleral outflow, but
studies differ on their effect on the conventional pressuresensitive outflow pathway.12–16 if pressure-sensitive outflow is increased, and the increase is from changes in trabecular meshwork, prostaglandins would represent the first
trabecular drugs. they could serve as prototypes for future
drugs and also indicate targets for future gene therapy.
studies using classic schiøtz tonography find that  xxxd340xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  increase outflow facility.1,12–14
studies using pneumatonography have produced varied results. a significant increase in outflow facility was found
after treatment with phxa34, a racemic mixture of  xxxd2446xxx , with a 4-minute pneumatonography test17 but not
with a 2-minute pneumatonography test.18 toris et al found
that outflow facility increased in  xxxd2446xxx -treated eyes
when compared with untreated fellow eyes but not when
compared with baseline in the same eye, using a 2-minute
pneumatonography test.15 in the same patients, however,
 xxxd2446xxx  had no significant effect when using the fluorophotometric method.15 because uveoscleral outflow cannot
be measured directly but must be calculated from the goldmann equation,19 the amount or proportion of aqueous
humor leaving through the conventional outflow pathway
directly affects the calculation of how much aqueous exits
through the uveoscleral pathway.
the reason for the different results in pressure-sensitive
outflow may be due to different measurement techniques.
the schiøtz and pneumatonography techniques use the
weight of the tonometer to increase intraocular pressure
(iop), which then decreases during the 4-minute test.20,21 in
contrast, the fluorophotometric method decreases iop with
an aqueous suppressant.22 each technique has advantages
and disadvantages. no study has compared these 4 techniques in the same group of subjects. our study was designed to compare the 4 techniques in the same subjects,
assessing the effect of commonly used prostaglandin drugs
to determine if differences in published results were due to
intersubject variability, technique, or drug effect.

http://aaojournal.org).

study design
the study was a double-masked placebo-controlled randomized
paired comparison with a 4-session crossover design. each subject
was enrolled for approximately 16 weeks. this time was divided
into 4 periods of treatment with 1 of 4 eyedrops:  xxxd340xxx 
0.03% ( xxxd340xxx , allergan, inc., irvine, ca),  xxxd2446xxx  0.005%
(pfizer, inc., new york, ny),  xxxd3414xxx  0.004% (alcon laboratories, fort worth, tx), or a placebo (ciba vision, duluth, ga).
subjects were treated for 7 days and had a washout period of at
least 4 weeks between each treatment period. this study con-

formed to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and was
reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the
mayo clinic. all subjects gave informed consent to participate.
the same person (ksl) performed all measurements.

study subjects
thirty-two healthy subjects were recruited. all were normal volunteers, 21 years or older, who had iops between 12 and
24 mmhg in both eyes and no history or evidence of glaucoma or
other ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. evaluation included
snellen visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy,
photogrammetry to measure anterior chamber (ac) volume, and
ultrasound pachymetry (dgh-500 pachette, dgh technologies,
exton, pa) to measure corneal thickness. autofluorescence was
measured in the ac and cornea.

treatment protocol
the study medications and placebo were purchased from the
manufacturers and rebottled by the pharmacy at the mayo clinic
into identical syndiotactic polypropylene dropper bottles to prevent the shape of the bottle from indicating which medication was
present. each subject received the 3 medications and placebo
(hypotears  xxxd2216xxx ), one at a time. the order of treatment
was assigned randomly, and neither the subject nor the investigators knew which drug was administered in any particular study
interval until the end of the study. all bottles were labeled by the
pharmacy to indicate only the subject number and when drops
from the bottle were to be instilled.
each of the 4 sessions of the study commenced with treatment
of one study drug or placebo and ended with 2 days of tests of
aqueous humor dynamics. the subject self-administered 1 drop of
the assigned medication to the left eye each day in the evening
(approximately 9 pm) for 7 days. only the left eye was treated,
rather than randomizing treatments between eyes, to allow determination of the return to baseline after drug treatment was stopped
and to eliminate the potential for eyes’ different responses. it also
allowed the determination of long-term variability of the untreated
eye, an important factor in assessing differences in drug effects
over the 4-month period. each patient recorded the exact time of
drug administration on a specially designed log sheet.
each measurement session was followed by a 4-week washout
period when no drug or placebo was administered. the iop was
measured before starting the next treatment to confirm no lingering
drug effect after the washout period. on day 7 of each treatment
session, the patient returned for the measurement of tonographic
outflow facility (pneumatonography at 8 am, schiøtz tonography at
11 am), iop, and episcleral venous pressure (evp). on day 8 after
receiving the last dose of medication the evening before, aqueous
flow rate and fluorophotometric outflow facility were measured.
the iop was checked before the schiøtz examination to verify that
it had returned to baseline and that the pneumatonography did not
have a lasting hypotensive effect. the sequence of tonographic
examinations was kept constant to allow direct comparison of
techniques, done exactly the same among the drugs. mixing testing
order could introduce unknown confounding factors causing increased variability in results for each drug.
the container bottles were collected from all subjects, and the
drugs in the first 13 bottles (5  xxxd2446xxx , 5  xxxd340xxx , 3  xxxd3414xxx ) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. this was done to confirm that no degradation had occurred
with time or with the rebottling into the syndiotactic polypropylene
bottles.

clinical measurements
detailed methods are available in “appendix” (available at http://
aaojournal.org). intraocular pressure was measured with a pneumatonometer before the start of each treatment session and on day
8. outflow facility was measured with all 3 commonly used
clinical techniques according to published methods: schiøtz tonography,20 pneumatonography (both 4 minute and 2 minute),18,21 and
fluorophotometry.22 episcleral venous pressure measurements
were also performed,23 but the results were variable enough that
they were not used. we calculated uveoscleral outflow using
assumed evps of 8, 9, 10, and 11 mmhg.14,24

calculated uveoscleral outflow
the pressure-insensitive outflow, generally assumed to be uveoscleral flow, was calculated by using a modified goldmann equation,19 fu ⫽ ff ⫺ c(pi ⫺ pe), where fu is uveoscleral outflow,
ff is aqueous humor flow measured by fluorophotometry, pi is
pressure in the ac, pe is evp, and c is outflow facility measured
by tonography or the flurophotometric method.22 in this study, c
was measured on day 7 by tonography and day 8 by fluorophotometry, whereas ff and pi were measured on day 8. c was
assumed to be the same on day 7 as it was on day 8.

statistical analysis
aqueous humor flow rate, outflow facility, iop, and uveoscleral
outflow measured during treatment with each drug were compared
with the same variables during treatment with a placebo. the same
variables were also compared between the treated left eye and the
untreated right eye, and iop was compared with iop before
treatment. comparisons between eyes or before and after treatment
within a group were made using paired t tests. the parameters
were compared among the treatment groups and placebo using a
1-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance (anova). significant differences were investigated using the student–newman–
keuls procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons. differences
were considered significant if p⬍0.05. this study had a 90%
chance of finding a 5% difference in iop, 5.4% difference in
aqueous flow, and 7.5% difference in outflow facility among
medication groups, if these differences existed (n ⫽ 30 subjects,
␣ ⫽ 0.05, and ␤ ⫽ 0.10).

outflow facility
detailed results are available in “appendix” (available at http://
aaojournal.org). schiøtz tonography found that drug treatments
increased the tonographic outflow facility by 38% to 50% compared with placebo treatment of these same eyes, and 57% to 76%
when compared with untreated fellow eyes (p⬍0.001; table 3).
outflow facility did not significantly differ among drug treatments.
pneumatonography results were mixed, with the 2-minute test
finding a 26% to 35% drug-induced increase in outflow facility
compared with placebo (p⬍0.05; table 3), whereas the 4-minute
pneumatonography results were 15% to 21% higher than placebo
but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p ⫽ 0.07).
outflow facility did not significantly differ among the drug
treatments.
outflow facilities estimated by using the fluorophotometric
method were approximately twice as high as those estimated by
using the schiøtz and pneumatonography methods, for both treated
and untreated eyes. although outflow facility values appeared
higher than placebo after drug treatment, ranging from 32% to
56%, this was statistically significant only for the  xxxd340xxx 
versus placebo comparison (table 3). when compared with fellow
eyes, outflow facilities ranged from 24% to 76% higher, although
these differences did not reach statistical significance.

results
two of the 32 subjects withdrew from the study after experiencing
discomfort from tonography during the first session, and no data
were collected from these individuals. the other 30 subjects (15
male, 15 female) completed all aspects of the study. mean age was
39⫾9 years (range, 23–56; median, 41). the baseline ocular characteristics of the subjects are summarized in table 1. the concentrations of the medications in the 13 syndiotactic polypropylene
bottles that were analyzed were between 92% and 100% of the
intended concentrations. thus, transfer to the nonoriginal bottles
and storage in the bottles did not significantly affect the concentration of the medications.
at baseline, there were no significant differences in iop among
the groups. as expected, on day 8 all 3 medications lowered iop
from baseline and when compared with the untreated fellow eye,
whereas the placebo had no effect (p⬍0.05; table 2). the average
rate of aqueous humor flow between 8:30 am and 10:45 am did not
significantly differ with drug treatment compared with placebo
treatment (p ⫽ 0.33; table 1). there were no significant differences in flow rate between treated and contralateral untreated eyes
after any treatment (p ⫽ 0.75).

uveoscleral outflow
all drugs showed increased uveoscleral outflow, although the
amount varied among the techniques. higher changes in calculated
uveoscleral outflow were found with tonographic techniques that
showed lower conventional tonographic facilities, and similarly
smaller changes in uveoscleral outflow were found with techniques
that gave higher conventional tonographic facilities. this is in
keeping with the nature of the calculation of uveoscleral outflow
with the goldmann equation: because the total iop change is fixed
and aqueous flow did not change, higher changes in tonographic
facility must result in lower changes in uveoscleral outflow and
vice versa.
both 4-minute pneumatonographic and fluorophotometic techniques found that all medications increased the uveoscleral outflow
compared with the placebo. the pneumatonography increases
ranged from 37% to 70%; (p⬍0.05; fig 1; complete data in table
4 [available at http://aaojournal.org]). values using schiøtz tonography data were increased by 38% to 50%, but these became
statistically significant only at the higher assumed evps of 10 and
11 mmhg (table 4). values for 2-minute pneumatonography were

increased by 25% to 35%, but these were not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.28). when compared with untreated fellow eyes,
changes in calculated uveoscleral outflow were generally similar to
the above results of drug versus placebo treatment.

variability over time
the untreated right eyes were measured simultaneously with the
treated left eyes and, thus, provided an estimate of the long-term
fluctuation (variability) of iop, aqueous flow, and outflow values
over time. intraocular pressure was least variable, with a mean
coefficient of variation of 8⫾3% over the 4-month study. aqueous
flow varied by 24⫾15%. tonographic outflow values varied by
26⫾11% for schiøtz, 42⫾22% for 2-minute pneumatonography,
30⫾12% for 4-minute pneumatonography, and 51⫾30% for the
fluorophotometric method. the schiøtz variability (coefficient of
variation) was significantly less than those of the other methods
(p⬍0.03).

discussion
 xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx  lowered iop in
healthy subjects, and none of these drugs suppressed the
aqueous humor production rate. these observations are
consistent with previous studies1,12–16 and confirm that iop
is lowered by increasing aqueous humor outflow. both
pressure-insensitive (uveoscleral) outflow and tonographic
outflow facility (usually considered trabecular outflow)
were increased, but the amount of increase varied with the
measurement technique used in the study. two of the 4

methods used to measure outflow facility, schiøtz tonography and 2-minute pneumatonography, found increases of up
76% when comparing drug and placebo in the same eye
(table 3). these methods generally did not find a significant
increase in uveoscleral outflow. in contrast, 4-minute pneumatonography and the fluorophotometric method did not
find a significant increase in tonographic outflow facility in
these same subjects, but did find an increase in the calculated uveoscleral outflow. comparison of drug-treated eye
versus untreated fellow eye generally found the same
results.
because these differences in outflow were found in the
same subjects, it is not intersubject variability but differences in techniques that account for the different results.
because the iop lowering and total outflow change are
fixed quantities, using the goldmann equation to calculate
uveoscleral outflow will result in the finding that for a given
iop drop a large change in trabecular outflow would entail
a smaller change in uveoscleral outflow and vice versa.
these results explain the differences in previous studies,
with some techniques finding an increase in conventional
tonographic outflow whereas others did not.12–18
outflow facility estimated by using the fluorophotometric method was almost twice as high as the facility determined by schiøtz tonography or pneumatonography. because these differences were found in the same subjects,
they arise from a difference in the techniques and not a
difference in cohorts of subjects. this difference is probably
related to the method used to change iop for assessment of
facility. pressure is raised during schiøtz and pneumatonog-

which measurement technique is best for assessing
aqueous outflow? although there is no gold standard technique of known accuracy, 6 eyes have been studied with
tonography during life followed by laboratory perfusion
immediately after enucleation for melanomas or orbital tumors.34,35 only a 0.3⫾16% difference in outflow facility
was found, indicating to both grant34 and becker and constant35 that schiøtz tonography gives an accurate assessment of outflow facility. we found that the variability over
time was least with schiøtz tonography (p⬍0.03 compared
with each of the other techniques, untreated right eyes).
in conclusion, all 3 prostaglandin analogs have a similar
mechanism of action: the aqueous humor production rate
does not change, and aqueous outflow increases. amounts
of increase of uveoscleral outflow and conventional outflow, however, varied with the measurement technique.
figure 1. prostaglandin effects on uveoscleral outflow (episcleral pressure
assumed 10 mmhg). drugs caused increase in uveoscleral flow for 3 of the
4 techniques used. because these results were all from the same subjects,
the differences are technique related and not due to different drug effects
on different groups of subjects. mean ⫾ standard deviation. 2-pneum ⫽

raphy by application of the tonometer, whereas it is lowered
during the fluorophotometric method by pharmacologically
suppressing aqueous humor production. if the pressure–
flow relationship is not linear across the full range of pressures used by both methods, then outflow facility, which is
the slope of this relationship, would appear higher or lower
depending on the range of pressures used in the estimate. in
addition, the fluorophotometric method is not always successful in normal subjects because the iop changes induced
by the aqueous suppressants can be small.
the increase in tonographic outflow facility could be
due to changes in the trabecular meshwork or from
changes in the sclera. prostaglandin analogs stimulate the
prostaglandin fp receptors of human trabecular cells in
cell culture.25 this could increase matrix metalloproteases within the meshwork and change the extracellular
matrix, similar to the effect proposed on the uveoscleral
pathway,26 –28 resulting in increased outflow. in the
sclera, prostaglandin-induced changes could affect measurement of conventional outflow facility by changing
scleral rigidity, by increasing scleral hydraulic conductivity, or both. a decrease in rigidity, caused by a prostaglandin-induced increase in matrix metalloproteases 1,
2, and 3 in the sclera,29 –31 would lead to an underestimation of pressure-sensitive outflow facility. correction
for this would make tonographic values even higher than
we found. an increase in sclera permeability29 to aqueous (hydraulic conductivity) could increase pressure-sensitive outflow once fluid reaches the suprachoroidal
space. the limiting factor in the mechanism for the
pressure insensitivity in this pathway, however, is the
small pressure differential between the ac and suprachoroidal space32 and not the scleral permeability. once
aqueous has entered the suprachoroidal space, it is known
to exit in a pressure-dependent fashion.33

methods
intraocular pressure. intraocular pressure was measured
with a pneumatonometer before the start of each treatment
session and on day 8. after administration of 0.5% proparacaine anesthesia, iop was measured in the right eye first,
followed by the left eye. three measurements were made of
each eye and the average recorded as the iop. on day 8,
iop was measured at 8:40 am and 10:55 am, and the mean
of the measurements at these 2 times was taken as posttreatment iop. the pneumatonometer was used for the
measurement because it did not require fluorescein, which
would have interfered with the fluorophotometric assessment of flow.
outflow facility by pneumatonography. outflow facility was measured at 8 am on day 7 by using a pneumatonometer (model 30 classic pneumatonometer, medtronic
solan, jacksonville, fl). the probe was cleaned and run
through a calibration check before each measurement. the
flat tip of the probe that indents the cornea has a diameter of
5 mm. a 10-g weight was added to the probe before the
tonography, according to the manufacturer’s protocol; the
total weight including the probe was 14.7 g.
after both corneas were anesthetized with 0.5% proparacaine, iop in both eyes was measured with the subject in the
sitting position and then in the supine position. facility of
outflow was then measured, right eye first. the contralateral
eye was covered with cellophane to prevent the cornea from
drying.* subjects were asked to breathe normally during the
procedure and look at a fixation target 6 feet away. the eyelids
were held open gently by the examiner without pressing on the
globe, and the probe was placed on the cornea for a few
seconds before the recording was started. intraocular pressure
was recorded while the probe rested on the central cornea for
4 minutes. the iop at 2 minutes was noted.
the outflow facility was calculated from lines fitted to the
initial and final pressures by a proprietary program built into
the pneumatonometer. on some recordings (50 of the 240), the
initial or final iop was obviously erroneous because of blinking, eye movement, or other artifacts. in a separate analysis,
this artifactual iop value was adjusted by the examiner to fit
the apparent iop curve during the measurement, ignoring the
artifactual blip in the iop. this revised iop was entered into
the program, and the facility was recalculated. the 2-minute
outflow facility was calculated by the program from the initial
iop and iop at 2 minutes.
schiøtz tonographic outflow facility. the recording
schiøtz tonometer used in this study had a concave tip with
an external diameter of 10 mm and was used with the
standard 5.5-g weight. the total weight of the tip as applied
to the cornea was 16.4 g. outflow facility was measured by
this method at 11 am on day 7, 3 hours after pneumatonography. the iop was checked before the schiøtz examination
to verify that it had returned to baseline and that the pneumatonography did not have a lasting hypotensive effect.
the rate of change in iop over 4 minutes was measured
during application of the schiøtz tonometer to the central
cornea with the subject supine.

795.e1

the tonometer scale r was estimated from the recorded
pressure curve every 30 seconds for the 4 minutes. a
second-degree polynomial was fitted to these data by the
method of least squares, and the change in the fitted curve
between 0 and 4 minutes was used to determine outflow
facility by interpolation of the 1955 outflow facility tables.
at completion of the study (before the code was broken), all
schiøtz tonography tracings were graded by 3 examiners
(dhj, jwm, dr richard brubaker) to determine if they
were of sufficient quality for interpretation. traces with
excess noise or extreme excursions were deemed unfit for
use and were excluded from further analysis. this amounted
to only 6% (14/240) of the tracings (see “results”).
fluorophotometry. the rate of aqueous humor flow
was calculated from the rate of fluorescein clearance from
the anterior segment on day 8. fluorescein was selfadministered at 2 am, 1 drop every 5 minutes, 3 to 5 times
depending on the participant’s age. a scanning ocular fluorophotometer described by mclaren and brubaker† was
used to measure fluorescein concentration in the ac and
cornea. the rate of aqueous humor flow was calculated from
the rate of disappearance of fluorescein from the combined
cornea and ac:
flow ⫽

⌬m f
ca⌬t

⫺ 0.25 ␮l ⁄ minute,

[1]

where ⌬mf is the loss of mass of fluorescein from the
combined cornea and ac during an interval ⌬t, ca is
the average concentration of fluorescein in the ac during
the same interval (estimated from the initial and final concentrations, assuming an exponential decay), and 0.25 ␮l/
minute is the assumed flow rate equivalent to the diffusional
loss of fluorescein from the eye.† the aqueous humor flow
rate between 8:30 am and 10:45 am was calculated.
fluorophotometric outflow facility.  xxxd1891xxx :55 am, after
the second measurement of fluorescence and iop, either
acetazolamide (250 mg) was given orally or a drop of 0.5%
 xxxd3377xxx  was instilled in each eye to reduce iop by deceasing
aqueous humor production.‡ fluorescence in the anterior
segment and iop were remeasured at 12:10 pm, 1:10 pm, and
2:10 pm. the aqueous humor flow rate (fa) was determined
before acetazolamide or  xxxd3377xxx  intervention and during
three 1-hour intervals after intervention (a, b, or c) by
using equation 1. fluorophotometric outflow facilities were
calculated for each of the 3 intervals by using
c fl⫺x ⫽

fa ⫺ fa⫺x
iop ⫺ iopx

[2]

where cfl⫺x is fluorophotometric outflow facility during
each interval (a, b, or c), iop is iop just before treatment
with the aqueous flow suppressant, and iopx is the average
iop between the beginning and the end of interval a, b, or
c, respectively. three separate fluorophotometric outflow
facilities were calculated, one for each interval, and the
average of these was reported as cfl.

lim et al 䡠 mechanism of prostaglandins
if cfl was calculated to be negative or ⬎2 standard deviations above the mean, that value was not used in the equation
(this accounted for 1 or 2 patients per session; see “results”).
episcleral venous pressure. an episcleral venomanometer (eyetech, morton grove, il)§ was used to measure
evp at 11 am on day 8. the balloon membrane was positioned on the surface of the sclera near the temporal limbus.
during continuous viewing of a medium-size vein on the
surface of the sclera, the dial on the instrument was turned
to increase the pressure within the balloon until the vein
collapsed to about half its original diameter. the pressure
was read and recorded by a second investigator.
the initial measurements of evp varied greatly among
subjects, between fellow eyes of the same subjects, and with
repeated measurements on the same eye several minutes apart.
when subjects were asked to perform a valsalva maneuver,
without the knowledge of the examiner, there was no consistent increase in the evp reading. in view of these inconsistencies, evp was not used further in this study, and values of 8,
9, 10, and 11 were used to calculate uveoscleral outflow.

results
intraocular pressure. at baseline, there were no significant differences in iop among the groups. on day 8, effects
of drug on iop were assessed in 3 ways: (1) change from
baseline, (2) difference from untreated fellow eye, and (3)
difference from placebo (table 2):
1. the repeated-measures anova indicated a significant difference in the iop from baseline among the 4
treatments. specifically, all 3 medications lowered
iop from baseline, whereas there was no change in
iop after the placebo (p⬍0.05; table 2).  xxxd340xxx 
decreased iop by 1.6 mmhg more than  xxxd2446xxx 
(p⬍0.05). the amount of iop lowering by  xxxd3414xxx 
was between the other 2 medications and did not
statistically significantly differ from either group.
2. all 3 medications reduced iop when compared with
the untreated right eye (p⬍0.05; table 2). the difference after  xxxd340xxx  was greater than the difference after  xxxd2446xxx  (⫺0.9 mm hg; p⬍0.05),
whereas the  xxxd3414xxx  group was between the other
groups and did not significantly differ from either.
3. repeated-measures anova revealed a significant
difference between the 4 treatments. specifically, all
medications reduced iop when compared with placebo on day 8 (p⬍0.05; table 2). the mean iop with
 xxxd340xxx  treatment was 0.6 mmhg lower than with
 xxxd2446xxx  or  xxxd3414xxx  (p⬍0.05). the  xxxd2446xxx 
and  xxxd3414xxx  groups did not significantly differ from
each other.
outflow facility
schiøtz method. all tracings were graded by the examiners before the treatment was unmasked; 94% (226/240)
were good. twelve of the 14 tracings of poor quality were
from the same 3 participants. these 3 participants were
considered poor tonography subjects and were therefore
eliminated from tonography analysis for schiøtz and
pneumatonography.

repeated-measures anova indicated a significant difference between the 4 treatments (p⬍0.001). drug treatments increased the tonographic outflow facility by 38% to
50% compared with placebo treatment of these same eyes
(table 3). outflow facility did not significantly differ
among drug treatments. when compared with untreated
fellow eyes, the increase in outflow facility after drug treatment ranged from 57% to 76% (table 3).
pneumatonographic method. the instrument that records
pneumatonography has a proprietary program that calculated
outflow facility based on the initial and final iop without
regard for the shape of the curve or obvious artifacts at the
beginning or end of the tracing. the program allows the user to
adjust the initial or final iop. on 50 of the 240 tracings, the
initial or final iop trace (4-minute tracing) showed a short
irregular deflection that affected the iop and would alter the
estimate of facility. we recalculated these facilities after extrapolating the curve 10 seconds before or after the deviation.
these corrected data resulted in an overall 10% increase in the
mean outflow facility in the 50 tracings (mean increase,
0.02⫾0.10 ␮l/minute/mmhg). twenty-eight of the 50 tracings
had higher outflow facility and 22 had lower outflow facility
after correction. the corrected values were determined before
the coded drugs were unmasked, to avoid bias.
outflow facilities calculated from the corrected 4-minute
pneumatonography did not significantly differ between drug
and placebo treatments, ranging from 15% to 21% higher
than placebo (p ⫽ 0.07). when the uncorrected tracings
were used to calculate facility,  xxxd2446xxx  significantly increased facility as compared with the placebo, but effects of
the other medications were not significant.
in contrast to the 4-minute pneumatonography curves,
when using the first 2 minutes of the pressure curve (2-minute
pneumatonography) outflow facilities were increased after
drug treatments compared with the placebo in the same eye,
ranging from 26% to 35% higher than placebo (p⬍0.05; table
3). when compared with fellow eyes, however, outflow facility was not significantly increased (table 3). outflow facilities
did not significantly differ among the drug treatments.
uveoscleral outflow. because of the difficulty in consistently estimating evp, as others also have noted,储 uveoscleral outflow was calculated with assumed evps of 8, 9, 10,
and 11 mmhg (table 4). all medications increased the
pressure-insensitive (uveoscleral) outflow compared with
the placebo when calculated from the 4-minute pneumatonographic data at all assumed evps and fluorophotometric techniques at assumed evps of 9, 10, and 11 mmhg.
the increases calculated with the 4-minute pneumatonography ranged from 37% to 70%. changes calculated from
the fluorophotometric data were more variable, ranging
from 0% to ⫹322% (table 4). values using schiøtz tonography data were increased by 38% to 50%, but these became
statistically significant only at the higher assumed evps of
10 and 11 mmhg (table 4). values for the 2-minute pneumatonography were increased by 25% to 35%, but these
were not statistically significant.
when compared with untreated fellow eyes, changes in
calculated uveoscleral outflow were generally similar to the
above results of drug versus placebo treatment. calculations
using either 4-minute pneumatonography or fluorophotom-

ophthalmology volume 115, number 5, may 2008
etry revealed increased uveoscleral outflow at evps of 10
and 11 mmhg. the apparent increases using schiøtz tonography and 2-minute pneumatonography values did not reach
statistical significance (table 4).

discussion
pneumatonography versus schiøtz tonography. prior
studies directly comparing pneumatonography with schiøtz
tonography in the same subjects found that both methods gave
the same overall mean outflow facilities, similar to our findings
(table 3), but more variability in the pneumatonography results.¶ feghali et al surmised that this may be due to the smaller
size of the pneumatonometer tip allowing greater mobility on
the corneal surface, and more transmission of eye and hand
movements to the transducer.¶ the smaller tip of the pneumatonometer results in a higher pressure being applied to the
cornea (pressure is force per unit area). although the total
weights of the schiøtz and pneumatonometer probes are similar, 16.4 g and 14.7 g, the difference in tip sizes, 10 mm vs. 5
mm, results in a 4-fold larger surface area for the schiøtz tip,
and thus, the smaller pneumatonometer tip results in a greater
application of pressure. this could cause physical changes to
the aqueous outflow system. direct force applied to the central
cornea can open a closed angle by creating a reverse pupillary
block and pushing the iris back against the crystalline lens,
deepening the ac.# anterior chamber deepening causes an
increase in outflow facility.** if the anterior segment was
similarly displaced during pneumatonography, outflow facility
would be affected. we did not find outflow facility consistently
greater when measured by pneumatonometry than by schiøtz
tonography, however, in keeping with the previous report.¶
thus any induced changes of the outflow pathway would have
been intermittent, perhaps accounting for the increased variability noted with pneumatonography.¶ in a laboratory study,
moses commented that pneumatonography is unsuitable for
assessment of outflow facility because it underestimates the
magnitude of changes in iop, and the additional 10-g weight
required for tonography causes the scale reading to underestimate iop during tonography.††
schiøtz versus fluorophotometric tonography. both
schiøtz and pneumatonography measure the decay of the
acutely elevated iop only and assume aqueous flow changes
minimally during this time. in contrast, the fluorophotometric
method decreases the iop, and aqueous flow changes are
measured directly rather than assumed.‡ after determining a
baseline aqueous flow by fluorophotometry, aqueous flow is
decreased by administering  xxxd3377xxx  or acetazolamide. aqueous
flow and iop are measured 3 more times, and outflow facility
is calculated each time as the ratio of the change in flow to
change in pressure. the 3 values are averaged to achieve the
reported outflow facility. the high variability and higher outflow values found with the fluorophotometry technique can be
explained in part by the relatively low starting iop of these
normal subjects. because this technique differs from the others
in lowering iop with aqueous suppressant medications, lower
starting iops result in smaller iop differences after medication. although studies using the fluorophotometry method
have been reported in normotensive eyes,‡‡§§储储¶¶ the technique

in these studies, pneumatonography was done after aqueous
suppressive medications had been given, resulting in technically unsatisfactory examinations in up to 45% of patients
because of low starting iop.§§ studies in which the fluorophotometric and conventional tonographic techniques have been
used find differences ranging from ⫺85% to ⫹20%.‡†††
pseudofacility was thought to account for the difference
when tonography values were lower than fluorophotometry values.‡§§
