abstract—enzyme–inhibitor recognition is considered one of the most fundamental aspects in the area of drug discovery. however,
the molecular mechanism of this recognition process (induced ﬁt or prebinding and adaptive selection among multiple conformers)
in several cases remains unexplored. in order to shed light toward this step of the recognition process in the case of human  xxxg36xxx  (hace) and its inhibitor captopril, we have established a novel combinatorial approach exploiting solution nmr, ﬂexible docking calculations, mutagenesis, and enzymatic studies. we provide evidence that an equimolar ratio of the cis
and trans states of captopril exists in solution and that the enzyme selects only the trans state of the inhibitor that presents architectural and stereoelectronic complementarity with its substrate binding groove.

ace ( xxxg36xxx ) plays a central role in the
metabolism of vasoactive peptides and its gene is a candidate for several cardiovascular diseases.1 it has two
metalloproteinase domains (called n- (ace_n) and
c- (ace_c)), each containing a canonical zn2+-binding
sequence motif: hexxh (his-glu-x-x-his),2 and interdomain co-operation upon inhibitor binding has been
reported.3,4 inhibitors of ace are eﬀective and widely
used drugs for the therapy of hypertension, heart disease, diabetic neuropathy, and atherosclerosis.5–7 rationalization of the substrate domain diﬀerentiation8 and
atomic level pharmacophore reﬁnement of nine inhibitors for both the n- and c-domains of ace has been
recently reported by us.9

allows the stepwise identiﬁcation of the substrate pharmacophoric pattern associated with the recognition by
a speciﬁc receptor,10 was the basis for discovery eﬀorts
that produced the large family of the ace inhibitors.11
like other proline-containing peptides, captopril normally exists as an equilibrium mixture of cis and trans
isomers, with respect to the proline amide bond
(fig. 1a). the crystal structures of the ace enzyme
solved recently in complex with captopril,12–14 as well
as the x-ray structure of the inhibitor in its unbound
state,15 comprise only the trans isomer of the inhibitor.
however, a key question still exists concerning the
molecular basis for the selection of the inhibitor isomerization states during the recognition processes.

captopril, 1-[2(s)-3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-oxopropyl]-l proline, is the ﬁrst  xxxg36xxx  inhibitor for treatment of hypertension and heart failure. the
incorporation of the active-analog approach, which

the 1h nmr spectra of captopril as a function of ph
and solvent (h2o, d2o, and dmso-d6) have been
recorded at 600 mhz and the cis/trans equilibrium
constant of captopril has been measured by the relative
integrals of the a- and d-proton resonances of the two
isomerization states of the proline moiety (fig. 1a).
these signals are well resolved and allowed us to determine accurately the equilibrium constants for the cis-totrans interconversion at diﬀerent temperatures and to
calculate the thermodynamic parameters enthalpy

isomer is present) suggest, in a crude approximation,
that in the ﬁrst step of recognition 50% of the inhibitor
is readily available for its direct selection by the enzyme.
in order to rationalize this aspect in detail, we performed ﬂexible docking calculations9,16 of both isomers
(trans and cis) of captopril to the c-domain of hace.
the ﬁrst ﬁnding is that for both isomers, the carbonyl
oxygen of the peptide bond is locked by two strong
hydrogen bonds with residues h1089 and  xxxd2629xxx  of the
enzyme (fig. 2). this is in accordance with our previous
mutagenesis studies, where mutation of h1089 abolishes
binding of captopril to the enzyme.17 the accommodation of the trans captopril carboxy-terminal proline moiety by the enzyme s2 0 subsite is mediated through ionic
interactions and hydrogen bonds with k1087, q857,
and y1096 (fig. 2a).

the equilibrium (table 1) on the basis of the van’t hoﬀ
equation (fig. 1b).
remarkably, a similar ratio for the cis-to-trans isomerization states is observed at neutral ph. the dg° is statistically the same in h2o, d2o, and dmso-d6 at acidic
ph and almost the same in h2o and d2o at neutral ph.
since dg° in dmso-d6 solution is almost the same
as in h2o or d2o, it seems reasonable to assume that
the existence of exchangeable protons on the
solvent does not aﬀect the cis/trans equilibrium. the
trans isomer in d2o solution is enthalpically and
entropically favored (dh° = 3.63 ± 0.28 kj mol1 and
ds° = 1.75 ± 0.23 j k1), relative to the cis isomer
at acidic ph, whereas it is enthalpically favored but
entropically disfavored (dh° = 1.87 kj mol1 and
ds° = 3.76 ± 0.31 j k1), relative to the cis isomer at
neutral ph. the decreasing enthalpic beneﬁt of the trans
isomer at ph 6.8, compared to that at ph 2.15, should
be attributed to the repulsive interaction of the dipole
of the peptide bond with the negative charge of the carboxylate group. the increasing entropy contribution,
which results in nearly equal populations of the cis
(46%) and trans (54%) isomers at physiological ph,
should, similarly, be attributed to the repulsive interaction between the dipole of the peptide bond with the
negative charge of the carboxylate group, which results
in a reduction in the conformational space of the interacting groups and the associated solvent molecules of
water.these data together with the x-ray structure of
the ace–captopril complex (where only the trans

in the case of the cis form of the inhibitor its pyrrolidine
ring is loosely stabilized by the s2 0 subsite via weak
hydrophobic interactions with the y1096 and the
y1099 rings, for which it has limited access due to the
bulky hydroxyl group of y1096 (fig. 2c); however,
the ‘locking’ interactions provided mainly by k1087
and y1096 are present in the trans isomer and are absent
in the cis form. this less favorable accommodation of
the cis isomer of captopril by the enzyme active site is
in accordance to the estimated free energies of binding
( 5 kcal/mol for cis and  7 kcal/mol for trans)
and thus, it is in agreement with the conformational
state of the inhibitor as can be seen by the x-ray structure of the complex.13,14

a grid ﬂexible docking-calculation search has been performed, by mutating iteratively the enzyme carboxylate
docking partners of captopril (since the rest of the molecule shares the same architectural topology), allowing
to identify a case in which both isomers could have
equal probability to be accommodated by the enzyme.
speciﬁcally, the y1096f mutant resulted in comparable
free energies of binding for both states of the inhibitor
( 6.2 kcal/mol for cis and  6.7 kcal/mol for trans).
this can be rationalized by the fact that the carboxylate
group of the inhibitor could be selectively ‘locked’ in the
trans conformation through ionic interactions with the
side chain of k1087 (fig. 2b), whilst the polar to hydrophobic alteration accomplished in the y1096f mutant,
as also the elimination of the bulky hydroxyl group of
y1096, open access to a strong hydrophobic packing
of the pyrrolidine ring of the inhibitor, in the cis form,
with the side chains of f1096 and y1099 (fig. 2d).
interestingly, a similar intra-molecular aromatic (tyr)–
proline interaction has been recently suggested to stabilize the cis conformation of the tyr–pro amide bond,18
whereas in the current case the aromatic residue is provided by the enzyme (y1099).
in order to validate these ﬁndings, we mutated the
hace c-domain residues y1096 and k1087 to phe
and ala, respectively,19 and detailed kinetic studies have
been performed on these mutants. indeed, figure 3
shows that the y1096f and k1087a mutations produced a decrease in captopril binding aﬃnity (1/ki),
indicating experimentally their importance for captopril
docking. however, we noticed an interesting phenomenon: both mutants behave completely diﬀerently in their
inhibitor proﬁle and, most importantly, data with captopril inhibition for y1096f best ﬁt using a two-site model, whereas data for wild-type hace c-domain and the
k1087a mutant ﬁt on one-site model (table 2).
given these considerations, we could suggest that the
observed equimolar ratio of the two states (cis, trans)
of the inhibitor in solution is related to the two states
observed in our kinetic studies for the y1096f mutant
that could accommodate both of them with the same
probability in accordance with the docking calculations.
thus, since both states of the inhibitor could be accom-

modated by the modiﬁed enzyme, either the cis or the
trans form of the inhibitor should be engineered and restrained achieving a more potent drug with complementary architecture to the native enzyme binding groove.
in conclusion, the combination of pharmacophorehypotheses and protein-structure based virtual screening
is successful in developing lead compounds. however, as
the present study revealed, many uncertainties remain
about the details of the ligand–receptor interactions,
possibly restraining the ﬁne-tuning of the lead compound to a more potent drug. speciﬁcally, our nmr
studies on the ace inhibitor captopril in solution were
able to map the presence of equal population of the cis
and trans conformational states at physiological ph. a
ﬂexible docking grid-search allowed the identiﬁcation
of a point mutation (y1096f) of the hace-c enzyme
that could preferentially incorporate both states of the
inhibitor with the same probability. this in silico ﬁnding
has been independently validated through mutagenesis
and enzymatic studies. the results of this combinatorial
approach through nmr, ﬂexible docking, mutagenesis,
and enzymatic studies pinpoint the importance of the
multiple conformational states of the inhibitor that
should be taken into account in the frame of the drug
design process so as to maximize the inhibitory aﬃnity
for the enzyme and minimize the side-eﬀects of the interaction. the next step in this line of research will be the
utilization of our approach toward the investigation of
the current system in a drug-reﬁnement eﬀort.9
