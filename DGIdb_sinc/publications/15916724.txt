abstract
the present study investigates the molecular details of how  xxxd226xxx  inhibits preadipocyte differentiation and
examines the role of akt/pkb in regulation of differentiation and apoptosis. continual exposure of  xxxd226xxx , at the
clinic achievable dosage that does not induce apoptosis, suppressed 3t3-l1 cell differentiation into fat cells by inhibiting
the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  and c/ebpalpha and disrupting the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha, which determines the
programming of the adipogenic genes. interestingly, if we treated the cells for 12 or 24 h and then withdrew arsenic
trioxide, the cells were able to differentiate to the comparable levels of untreated cells as assayed by the activity of
 xxxg861xxx , the biochemical marker of preadipocyte differentiation. long term treatment blocked the differentiation and
the activity of  xxxg861xxx  could not recover to the comparable levels of untreated cells. continual exposure of arsenic
trioxide caused accumulation in g2/m phase and the accumulation of p21. we found that  xxxd226xxx  induced the
expression and the phosphorylation of akt/pkb and it inhibited the interaction between akt/pkb and  xxxg1807xxx  . akt/pkb
inhibitor appears to block the  xxxd226xxx  suppression of differentiation. our results suggested that akt/pkb may
play a role in suppression of apoptosis and negatively regulate preadipocyte differentiation.

introduction
arsenic, a natural constituent of soil and water, is a
well-known human carcinogen [1, 2]. chronic exposure
to inorganic forms of it from drinking water and air pollution can cause many types of cancers such as skin
cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer and kidney cancer.
in addition to its carcinogenic effects, arsenic has been
linked to type ii diabetes mellitus [1] and cardiovascular
diseases [2], for example atherosclerosis, hypertension
[3], and blackfoot disease [4]. the mechanisms of these
effects of arsenic on the development of diseases are not
known. but previous studies indicated that alteration of
cell proliferation contributes to its carcinogenicity [5]. on
the other hand, arsenic has been used to treat cancers
and it brings complete remission of acute promyeloid leukemia [6] . this could be due to the induction of differen-

tiation at lower dose or induction of apoptosis or autophagic cell death at higher dose [7]. others and we have
reported that arsenic at clinically achievable dosage induced
apoptosis by activating mitochondrial dependent apoptosis
[8, 9]. it is not surprising that  xxxd226xxx  could disrupt multiple signaling pathways for mitogenesis,
differentiation, apoptosis and cell cycle control [10, 11].
arsenic has significant impact on the differentiation of
cultured cells, including keratinocytes [12] and adipocytes
[13]. however, the molecular details for arsenic to inhibit
differentiation are still not clear. it is known that the induction of terminal differentiation requires a comprehensive
reprogramming of gene expression, and this could occur
in parallel with withdrawal from the cell cycle.  xxxg1807xxx  and
c/ebpalpha are two important transcription factors governing
adipocyte differentiation.  xxxg1807xxx  is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  family. it needs to form an active heterodimer with
rxralpha (rentinoid x receptor) to bind to ppar-response
elements (ppre), and stimulate transcription of the target
genes. the cooperation of  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr drives the ex379

pression of a number of adipocytic genes for preadipocyte
to differentiate and to maintain adipogenic phenotype [14].
the  xxxg118xxx  akt/pkb, also known
as protein kinase b (pkb), is an important survival factor
when cells were stimulated by a number of growth factors or cytokines. it is reported that akt/pkb is a pivotal
mediator of the pathway of insulin signaling that induce
the differentiation of preadipocyte [15]. also, it is well
documented that akt/pkb play a critical role in regulating
apoptosis. in this paper, we described that  xxxd226xxx  inhibited preadipocyte differentiation by downregulation
of transcription factors of  xxxg1807xxx  and c/ebpalpha and the
interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and its ligand rxralpha. we found
that akt/pkb was induced but the interaction between akt/
pkb and  xxxg1807xxx  was blocked by  xxxd226xxx .

10% fbs dmem. 24h later, cells were washed with pbs and then
starved in dmem containing 0.1% fbs for 24h to synchronize.
then cell cycle was initiated by replacement of the starvation medium with the full medium (dmem with 10% fbs). at the same
time 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  was added into the medium.

materials and methods

determination of enzyme activity of  xxxg861xxx 
cells were washed twice with ice-cold pbs and stem (250 µm
sucrose, 10 mm tris-hcl (ph7.4), 1 mm edta, 1 mm 2- xxxd26xxx ), and were scraped down to centrifuge. then cells were resuspended with 200 µl stem, fractioned by supersonic and centrifuged at 4ºc, 12,000 rpm for 30 min. the quantity of protein in
supernatant was determined and adjusted to the same level. 240 µl
reaction buffer (100 mm triethanolamine (ph 7.7), 0.25 mm edta,
1 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.2 mm nadh), 160 µl  xxxd533xxx  and 400 µl stem plus supernatant were added to
a 1 ml quartzose cup. change of absorbance at 340 nm was recorded
by using a beckman spectrophotometer. the activity of  xxxg861xxx 
were computed by the initial velocity of the reaction and showed as
nmol/min/mg protein.

cell lines, antibodies and reagents
mouse fibroblast line 3t3-l1 preadipocytes (atcc cl173)
were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem)
(gibco brl) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone), 100 u/
ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (gibco). to induce differentiation, 3t3-l1 preadipocytes were grown to confluence for two
days. 2 d after confluence, cells were induced to differentiate (d 0)
with addition of the standard differentiation inducing mix. insulin
(100 nm, sigma), dexamethasone (0.25 µm, sigma) and  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) (0.5 mm, sigma) were added to the medium for the first 48h. from day 2 to 6, the medium was supplemented with 100 nm insulin only. the cells were then switched
back to 10% fetal bovine serum from d 6 to 8. the cultures were
replenished every 2 days. 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  was added into the
medium 2 d prior to the induction and during the induction period. 5
µm akt/pkb inhibitor (1l-6-hydroxymethyl- xxxd2360xxx  2-(r)2-o-methyl-3-o-octadecylcarbonate, calbiochem) was added into
the medium 2 d prior to the induction in the presence or absence of
3 µm  xxxd226xxx .

flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle
cell cycle distribution was determined by using fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs). briefly, cells were harvested and washed
twice with pbs. after centrifugation, pellets were re-suspended in
500 µl pbs, added drop by drop into 5 ml cold (-20ºc) ethanol and
fixed at 4ºc overnight. before staining, the ethanol was removed and
cells were washed twice with 1% bsa (in pbs). then cells were resuspended in 400 µl pbs containing 1% bsa. 50 µl 500 µg/ml pi and
50 µl 10 mg/ml boiled  xxxg1963xxx  were added and cells were incubated
at 37ºc for 30 min before determination. the proportion of cells in
each phase of cell cycle was determined by a bd facscan.

western blotting
cells were harvested and washed twice with pbs, then were lysed with lysis buffer at 4ºc for 30 min. cells were centrifuged at 12,
000 rpm, 4ºc for 15min. after adjusting the protein concentrations,
lysates were boiled with loading buffer at 100ºc for 10 min. lysates
were run in 12% polyacrylamide-sds gels, and transferred to
nitrocellulose. the nitrocellulose blots were blocked with phosphate-

oil red o staining
dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline,
fixed by 10% formalin in phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature.
after fixation, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with filtered oil red o stock solution (0.5 g of oil
red o (sigma) in 100 ml  xxxd2400xxx ) for 2 h at room
temperature. cells were washed twice with water, visualized and
photographed.

cell apoptosis assay
cells were harvested and washed with pbs and then binding
buffer. after that, cells were stained with 25 ng/ml  xxxg166xxx -fitc
at 37ºc for 10min, and stained with pi just before detection. then
annexin-v positive apoptotic cells was determined by a bd facscan
as previously described [8].

cell cycle assay
cell synchronization
cells were incubated at the density of 2.5×105 cells/150mm2 in
380

buffered saline containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% tween 20 and
then treated with antibodies that recognize p21,  xxxg1807xxx , c/ebpalpha or
akt/pkb, respectively.

immunoprecipitation
cells were harvested and washed twice with pbs, then were
lysed with lysis buffer at 4ºc for 30 min. cells were centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 15min at 4ºc. supernatants were carefully collected
without disturbing the pellet and transferred to a clean tube. the
quantity of protein in them was determined and adjusted to the same
level. 2 µg  xxxg1807xxx  monoclonal antibody and 500 µl lysis buffer were
added into the supernatants if it contains 500 µg proteins and incubated at 4ºc overnight. protein g-argarose was washed thrice with
lysis buffer and added 20 µl per sample. then the proteins were
incubated at 4ºc for 2 h. after thrice washing with lysis buffer,
proteins were boiled with loading buffer at 100ºc for 10 min. then
western blotting was performed and antibodies such as rxralpha, akt/
pkb were used.

results
clinic achievable dosage of  xxxd226xxx  could not
induce apoptosis but potently inhibited the differentiation of preadipocyte 3t3-l1
we first examined the effect of  xxxd226xxx  on cell
apoptosis and found that 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  could not
induce apoptosis of 3t3-l1 preadipocyte (fig. 1a) although higher dosage induced cell death (data not shown).
we did not detect measurable caspase activity after the
treatments with clinic achievable dosage (data not shown).
we observed that continual exposure of the cells with 3
µm  xxxd226xxx  potently inhibited differentiation of 3t3l1 cells as assayed by oil red o staining. as shown in
fig. 1d, cells treated with insulin containing differentiation mix were induced to differentiate and obtained morphology with microscopically visible droplets of lipids. in
contrast, under the identical conditions, cells grown in 3
µm  xxxd226xxx  or 0.5 µm vp16, a dna damage agent,
did not show lipid accumulation (fig. 1e and f). we further examined the biochemical marker of preadipocyte
differentiation, the appearance of  xxxg935xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ). as shown in fig. 1g, the activity of
 xxxg861xxx  was strongly inhibited by 3 µm  xxxd226xxx .
interestingly, the cells can continue to differentiate to the
comparable levels if we treated the cells for 12 or 24 h and
then withdrew  xxxd226xxx  (fig. 1h). if the cells were
treated for 48h with  xxxd226xxx , the differentiation
was markedly blocked and the activity of  xxxg861xxx  could
not recover to the comparable levels of untreated cells.
 xxxd226xxx  induced slight g2 accumulation of
cell cycle and p21 expression
because  xxxd226xxx  and vp16 are both cytotoxic
agents, commonly used clinically for treatments of
cancers, we next checked their effects on cell cycle of
382

3t3-l1. cells were treated with  xxxd226xxx  after 24 h
serum starvation, and the cell cycle was examined by flow
cytometry after pi staining. as shown in fig. 2a, there
was an increase of s phase at 24h and accumulation of
g2/m phase at 48h after  xxxd226xxx  treatment, whereas
vp16 treated cells were arrested at g2/m 24h after treatment (fig. 2b and 2c), suggesting that these two agents
has distinct effects on cell cycle. at the same time, p21
were increased following  xxxd226xxx  treatments (fig.
2d).
 xxxd226xxx  inhibited the expression of ppargammagamma
alpha
and c/ebpalpha
to understand the molecular mechanisms of arsenic
inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation, we next examined the protein levels of  xxxg1807xxx  and c/ebpalpha following
the induction of differentiation and the treatment of the
cytotoxic agent. as shown in fig. 3, expression of  xxxg1807xxx 
and c/ebpalpha were significantly reduced in  xxxd226xxx 
treated cells in comparison with that of control. there
was significant reduction of both ppargamma1 and ppargamma2
expression although there was a fluctuation of ppargamma1
expression following the treatments. these results indicate that  xxxd226xxx  inhibits lipid accumulation and
preadipocyte differentiation by downregulation of the expression of adipocyte transcription factors during
differentiation.
 xxxd226xxx  inhibited the interaction between
alpha
ppargammagamma and rxralpha
because the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha is
critical for the activity of the transcription complex, we
examined the expression of rxralpha and interaction between
the two proteins after the treatment of 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  and 0.5 µm vp16. our result showed that the treatment of  xxxd226xxx  also inhibited the expression of
rxralpha (fig. 4a). importantly, we found that the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha was reduced when treated
with  xxxd226xxx  as assayed by immunoprecipitation
(fig. 4b). another cytotoxic agent vp16 had minimal effect on the interaction of  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha.
 xxxd226xxx  could inhibit the interaction between
ppargammagamma and akt/pkb
having shown that  xxxd226xxx  strongly suppressed
differentiation by disrupting signaling  xxxg1807xxx /rxralpha
pathway, we next examined if akt/pkb may be involved
in mediating the survival signal even when cells were
treated with  xxxd226xxx . we found that the treatment
of  xxxd226xxx  increased the expression of akt/pkb
compared to that of control which was treated with differentiation mix.  xxxd226xxx  significantly enhanced

fig. 2 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  could induce cell cycle arrest and upregulation of p21. (a) the cell cycles of 3t3-l1 cells were determined
by flow cytometry. cells were synchronized before treatment. after synchronization, 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  or 0.5 µm vp16 was
added into the medium containing 10% fbs for 24, 36, 48 h respectively. (b)  xxxd226xxx  induced g2 arrest. (c) vp16 induced g2
arrest. (d) p21 was determined by western blotting. 3t3-l1 cells were induced to differentiate. during this process 3 µm arsenic
trioxide was added into the medium from d-2 for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 d respectively. then western blotting was performed.

the phosphorylation of akt/pkb, thereby its activation (fig.
5a), although the expression of  xxxg1807xxx , c/ebp and rxr
was reduced under identical conditions. interestingly, we
found that akt/pkb inhibitor could counteract the repression effect of  xxxd226xxx  on the differention of 3t3l1. when the 3t3-l1 cells were treated with  xxxd226xxx  and akt/pkb inhibitor together, there are more than
90% of cells accumulate droplets of lipids (see fig. 5c
and d). furthermore, we showed that akt/pkb interacted
with  xxxg1807xxx  directly and  xxxd226xxx  could suppress
the interaction between akt/pkb and  xxxg1807xxx  (fig. 5b).
our results suggest that akt/pkb could negatively regulate preadipocyte differentiation and may function to suppress apoptosis in the cells when treated with arsenic
trioxide.

discussion
the current study examined the molecular details of the
inhibitory effects of  xxxd226xxx  on cell differentiation
and apoptosis. we found that  xxxd226xxx  could inhibit
the expression of the  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha and disrupt the
interaction between them. we showed that akt/pkb expression and its phosphorylation are induced upon arsenic
trioxide treatment. terminal differentiation is usually associated with the long term survival. apart from the induction of the differentiation programme, insulin also activates
survival signals. of note, akt/pkb, which was found to
be a critical molecule for cell survival, is significantly induced by insulin. we found that akt/pkb expression was
induced and it was activated as revealed by phosphorylation upon the treatment of  xxxd226xxx , even when the

fig. 4  xxxd226xxx  can decrease the expression of rxralpha and
inhibit the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha. 3t3-l1 cells
were induced to differentiate. (a) rxralpha level was determined by
western blotting. during this process 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  were
added into the medium from d-2 for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 d respectively.
(b) the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and rxralpha was determined by
immunoprecipitation. 3 µm  xxxd226xxx  or 0.5 µm vp16 was

undifferentiated control, fd-control: fully differentiated control)

cell differentiation is significantly suppressed. it is interesting to note that akt/pkb can directly interact with  xxxg1807xxx 
and  xxxd226xxx  can inhibit the interaction between
them. the reduced interaction is associated with the inhibition of cell differentiation. of note, we found that akt/
pkb inhibitor could counteract, at least in part, the repression effect of  xxxd226xxx  on the differention of 3t3l1 while the inhibitor itself has minimal effects on cell
differentiation and cell death. this indicates that the repression effect of  xxxd226xxx  on the differentiation
was depended on the activation of akt/pkb. this is in
agreement with previous report that akt/ xxxg118xxx  plays an
important role in the regulation of preadipocyte growth
and proliferation, and it is down-regulated upon differentiation [16]. our results are also in agreement with wealth
information that akt/pkb functions to suppress apoptosis.

akt was determined by immunoprecipitation. 3 µm  xxxd226xxx 
or 0.5 µm vp16 was added into the medium till the end of the

trioxide inhibition of differentiation. 5 µm akt/pkb inhibitor was
added into the medium 2 d prior to the induction in the absence or

 xxxd226xxx . after 10 d, cells were fixed and stained with oil red

trioxide activate a number of signaling pathways, such as
mapk, erk and jnk or suppress certain signaling pathways [19, 20]. the molecular details of the network of
different signaling molecules to regulate cell differentiation need to be further investigation.
in addition to show that it inhibits the interaction between akt/pkb and  xxxg1807xxx , we found that  xxxd226xxx 
disrupts the interaction between  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr, critical
transcriptional factors functions together to regulate
adipogenic genes expression. these results extended previous findings which suggested that sodium arsenite could
inhibit the differentiation of another preadipocyte cell line,
c3h 10t1/2 by inhibiting the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  and c/
ebpalpha [21]. it appears that the inhibition of the activity of
 xxxg861xxx  by  xxxd226xxx  is reversible and preadipocyte
differentiation reached the comparable levels between control cells and cells exposed to the short exposure (12, 24
h). there may be a critical decision-making time for the
cells to decide their fates between 24 and 48 h. we observed that there was an accumulation of the cells at g2
phase and the increased expression of p21, at 48 h. p21
was also implicated in regulating cell survival. altiok and
his colleague found that  xxxg1807xxx  initiates withdrawal from
the cell cycle during adipogenesis [22]. in smooth muscle
cells,  xxxg1807xxx  activation results in accumulation of cells in
g0/g1 [23]. our results showed that  xxxd226xxx  decreased the expression of  xxxg1807xxx , suggesting that it is not
likely to be responsible for g2 accumulation. our results
also is in contrast to the finding that sodium arsenite inhibited the expression of p21 [21]. other report suggests that
arsenite induced p27, which is also related to cell cycle
entry [24]. this warrants further study of the determination of cell fates under arsenic stress conditions.
in summary, current study corroborates the earlier report that arsenic inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes
into adipocytes. we showed that arsenic disrupts adipogenesis via perturbation of the interaction of  xxxg1807xxx  and
rxralpha pathway. importantly, our data suggest that akt/
pkb could be a major survival signal and negatively regulate cell differentiation. our results may be useful for understanding of effects of  xxxd226xxx  in cell death and
differentiation.
