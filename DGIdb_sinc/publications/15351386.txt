abstract—cocaine abuse continues to be prevalent and eﬀective therapies for cocaine craving and addiction remain elusive. in the
last decade immunopharmacotherapy has been proposed as a promising means to alleviate this illness. by using the organism’s
natural immune response, an anti-cocaine vaccine promotes the production of cocaine-speciﬁc antibodies that sequester the drug
before their passage into the brain, where it exerts its reinforcing and thus addictive eﬀects. a series of studies demonstrating the
cocaine-blocking properties of various immunogenic conjugates will be reviewed in the context of the neuropsychopharmacological
proﬁle of the drug.

1. introduction
cocaine abuse has produced a major epidemic health
problem in north america in the 1980s, and has since
become a serious medical and public health concern in
the united states, with approximately 2.1 million people
dependent on cocaine.1
the abuse of cocaine is maintained by the drug’s eﬀects
on brain reward systems, and mediated at least in part

by its dopaminergic action. the patterns and consequences of use are best understood by considering the
pharmacokinetics (rapid absorption and delivery to the
brain, relatively short half-life) and the pharmacodynamics (intense central and peripheral neural stimulation). cocaine is used therapeutically as a topical and
local anesthetic. toxicity occurs primarily in cocaine
abusers, but also occasionally after therapeutic dosing.
medical complications reﬂect primarily excessive central
nervous system (cns) stimulation and excessive vasoconstriction, the latter resulting in severe hypertension
and/or organ ischemia with associated organ injury.
most deaths that result from medical complications
of cocaine intoxication are sudden and occur before

medical intervention is possible. other complications of
cocaine abuse with severe personal and social consequences include traumatic deaths and injuries, and
reproductive disturbances, as well as transmission of
infectious diseases, especially aids. cocaine addiction
represents a serious social and health problem, which
has led the national institute on drug abuse (nida) to
urge the scientiﬁc research community for the development of an eﬀective pharmacological treatment for this
condition. however, pharmacotherapies of cocaine
addiction that typically target the monoaminergic
neurochemical substrates implicated in its reward
properties, have as yet been unsuccessful, and often
generate adverse side eﬀects.2

this review focuses primarily on the development and
testing of the immunotherapeutic reagents reported over
the last decade. first, a general overview of cocaine
neuropharmacology and pharmacotherapeutic research
to date will be presented. next, we oﬀer a perspective on
the challenges to be faced in the successful application of
the immunotherapeutic technologies thus far developed.
finally, other protein-based, nonpharmacological cocaine blockers will be explored.

over the last decade, an alternate line of research has
emerged aimed at treating cocaine addiction using
immunological reagents and the immune system to
peripherally block the eﬀects of the drug. this approach
addresses key components that constitute an eﬀective
treatment venue, such as a signiﬁcant decrease of the
rapidity of cocaine permeation into the brain while circumventing unwanted side eﬀects. early work demonstrated that antibodies speciﬁc for haptenic drugs were
feasible and that they were useful in the attenuation of
their eﬀects.3 in this study, a rhesus monkey trained to
self-administer heroin and cocaine was immunized with
a morphine hemisuccinyl-bovine  xxxg124xxx  conjugate, that resulted in the gradual and selective extinction
of heroin self-administration. twenty years later, interest in this area was renewed with the ﬁrst successful
report describing eﬀective blockade of the psychostimulant eﬀects of cocaine by active immunization in rats.4
the approach is based on the premise that cocaine by
itself is not an immunogenic molecule, and as such
cannot produce an immune response. however, if conjugated with an immunogenic carrier molecule, administration of the conjugate would induce the immune
system to produce antibodies against cocaine. therefore, anti-cocaine antibodies induced by a cocaine vaccine, by inhibiting the entry of cocaine into the brain,
will inhibit the ability of cocaine to interact with all of its
targets in the cns. the speciﬁcity of the cocaine vaccine
for the drug, rather than for its target, should also
minimize interference with other therapies. also, a
therapeutic vaccine based on active immunization has
the potential to provide long-lasting clinical eﬃcacy for
relapse prevention after administration and to have
minimal problems with compliance in humans who are
motivated to stop using cocaine.

cocaine is obtained from coca leaves (containing between 0.6% and 1.8% alkaloidal cocaine) using a relatively simple method by which it is extracted from the
leaves with an organic solvent (often kerosene), resulting
in a coca paste containing about 80% cocaine. the
alkaloids are passed through an acidic aqueous solution
based on hydrochloric acid; the solution is neutralized
and the cocaine is extracted by recrystalization. cocaine
hydrochloride (hcl) is the pharmaceutical form used as
a local anesthetic, and abused by drug addicts. it is
readily water-soluble and thus can be taken orally,
intranasally, or by intravenous injection. cocaine hcl is
vulnerable to pyrolysis, resulting in a poor rewarding
eﬀect when smoked. however, upon transformation into
cocaine freebase, (popularly termed ‘crack’ or ‘rock’
cocaine) by dissolving it in an alkaline solution, followed
by precipitation, the hydrochloride salt transforms into
a smokable, pyrolysis-resistant material.

the advent of new technologies for monoclonal
antibody production and for creating highly speciﬁc
human antibodies has brought these proteins into the
realm of clinical evaluation. this alternative oﬀers the
immunotherapeutic application of passive transfer
for the treatment of cocaine overdose. other groups,
as well as our own group, have explored alternate
protein-based therapies involving the destruction of
cocaine before it has a chance of reaching the brain such
as murine monoclonal catalytic antibodies,5–7 and
cocaine metabolism enhancement with  xxxg248xxx .8

2. cocaine pharmacology

diﬀerent routes of consumption yield somewhat diﬀerent
patterns and levels of plasma cocaine concentration. extremely rapid absorption occurs with both intravenous
injection and smoking. hence, typical single doses taken
by the routes yield rather high concentrations of circulating cocaine (500–1000 ng/ml),9;10 although even higher
values can be attained with multiple doses that mimic the
pattern of a cocaine ‘binge’.11 with a pk a of 8.7, orally
consumed cocaine tends to be ionized in the digestive
system, slowing the rate of absorption. also, snorting
results in slower absorption; consequently these routes
yield lower cocaine levels in the range of 100–500 ng/ml.
the likelihood that a person will become addicted to
cocaine depends to a large degree on the method, frequency and duration that a person used the cocaine.
one study conducted by the outpatient recovery centers found that cocaine smokers were twice as likely to
fail to complete their treatment program compared to
intranasal abusers. other elements that determine
addiction liability are: the psychological and physical
changes brought about by drug use, the degree of
change, the speed of onset of the change, the duration of
change, and the post-drug eﬀects.12 given the characteristics that deﬁne the probability of addiction, cocaine
is most addictive when it is smoked. cocaine can be
smoked as coca paste, as freebase, or as crack. the
popularity of crack compared to freebase is largely a
product of marketing techniques, which make small

amounts of high-quality cocaine available at low prices
and without having to undertake a dangerous chemical
process to convert cocaine to a smokable form. in fact,
smoking is not an eﬃcient method of delivering cocaine
to the body. a signiﬁcant portion of the drug dose is lost
when the cocaine is heated in preparation to be smoked.
the eﬀects of the drug come on very quickly; only 8–10 s
pass before the user experiences the high. the peak
concentration of the drug in the brain also occurs more
rapidly when smoked, resulting in greater behavioral
eﬀects for a shorter period of time. also contributing to
the reinforcing and addiction potential of crack is the
fact that the eﬀects of the drug last only 8–10 min. after
the high is over, the crack user feels anxious, depressed,
and paranoid. such a rapid shift between positive and
negative eﬀects of the drug make users crave another
‘hit’ of the drug to restore the euphoria they felt just
moments before.13

esterase deﬁciency) can reﬂect unexpected variations in
the intensity of the pharmacological and toxicological
response to cocaine.

cocaine metabolizes primarily into ecgonine methyl
ester (2) and benzoylecgonine (3, fig. 1), which are
renaly excreted. both metabolites, account for 75–90%
of cocaine metabolism.9 at a smaller scale, ecgonine and
the biologically active metabolite norcocaine are also
formed. upon breakdown of cocaine to ecgonine methyl
ester, rapid catalysis by serum and liver cholinesterases
occurs, while hydrolysis of the ethyl ester linkage to
form benzoylecgonine may be nonenzymatic.14 finally,
the demethylation of cocaine to form norcocaine (4)
takes place through the hepatic mixed function oxidase
system.

3. cocaine neuropharmacology

turning to the pharmacokinetics, the half-life of cocaine
is short, approximately 90 min, because it is rapidly
metabolized by the liver, which leads during its ﬁrst
passage to the production of benzoylecgonine. renal
elimination of cocaine and benzoylecgonine is prompt
and is greater if there is an acidic urine ph, whereas the
metabolite is eliminated preferably at an alkaline ph.
metabolic detoxiﬁcation of cocaine is promoted by the
plasmatic and hepatic cholinesterases, whose ﬂuctuations in activity (for instance, in the fetus, the newborn
child, during pregnancy, old age, in congenital cholin-

in studies using intravenous injections, variable estimates of half-life elimination of cocaine range from 16
to 90 min across diﬀerent individuals.14 despite this
variability, the rapid clearance of cocaine results in the
subjective ‘high’ produced by a single intravenous or
smoked dose of cocaine may last only about 30 min.15 it
has been hypothesized that this pharmacokinetic feature
is a key component in the high addictive value of cocaine, and thus merits special consideration in the
development of therapeutic strategies to treat its abuse
and relapse potential.

the two main health-hazards associated with cocaine
consumption are the abuse of the drug and the toxicity/
lethality as a result of overdose. the neuropharmacology of both of these conditions focuses on the actions of
cocaine upon the discrete aspects of the cns and disruptions of cerebral blood ﬂow. the eﬀects of cocaine
on the cns and on cerebral blood ﬂow are complex and
only partly understood. cocaine alters synaptic transmission by interacting with the plasma membrane
transporters for dopamine (da), norepinephrine (ne),
and serotonin (5ht), blocking cellular uptake, which in
turn enhances monoaminergic synaptic activity by
increasing transmitter availability within the synaptic
cleft.16–18 actions at the  xxxg2149xxx  are believed to
be most important for the reinforcing eﬀects of cocaine;
for example, mice with a null mutation in the da
transporter gene are much less sensitive than normal
mice to the behavioral eﬀects of the drug.19
the major subjective and behavioral eﬀects of cocaine
are summarized in table 1. low to moderate doses of
cocaine in naive subjects or in users who have not yet
progressed to heavy, chronic patterns of drug intake
entail a behavioral and subjective aftermath of a positive, powerfully reinforcing nature such as euphoria and
hypermotility. many of these positive eﬀects become

negative or aversive with escalation of cocaine dose and
duration, and some of these eﬀects are present in most
high-dose users. when taken chronically, cocaine may
lead to stereotypic (frantic and repetitive) motor responses.10;20 therefore, the magnitude of the reinforcing
properties of cocaine intake are directly correlated to the
dose of the drug and, as mentioned in the previous
section, route of administration.
a wealth of research has demonstrated that cocaine
exerts its reinforcing and thus addictive eﬀects within the
neurocircuitry of the mesocorticolimbic da system.21
the most widely used animals models used to demonstrate the neural correlates of cocaine’s psychoactive and
reinforcing eﬀects are the locomotor activity assay and
intravenous self-administration. there is substantial
evidence linking cocaine-induced locomotor activation
to blockade of da reuptake. kelly and iversen ﬁrst
reported reductions in cocaine-induced locomotor
activity, and many studies since have supported this
hypothesis showing that locomotor activity can be elicited by direct microinjections of cocaine in the nucleus
accumbens, a structure found within the mesocorticolimbic da system.22;23
the neural mechanisms of cocaine reinforcement have
been most extensively studied using the self-administration paradigm. early studies showed that low doses
of da antagonists increased the rate of cocaine selfadministration, whereas high doses of the same compounds led to a cessation of responding.24;25 moreover,
cocaine self-administration is attenuated by 6-ohda
lesions of either the nucleus accumbens26 or the ventral
tegmental area (vta), the site of the dopaminergic
neurons that project to the accumbens.27 consistent
with these ﬁndings, in vivo microdialysis experiments
have shown that cocaine self-administration leads to
increased extracellular da concentrations in the nucleus
accumbens.28 therefore, most of the behavioral eﬀect
of cocaine in animals have been attributed to activation of dopaminergic transmission, particularly in the
nucleus accumbens.

eralized epileptic seizures,34 believed to be a consequence
of cocaine-induced hyperpyrexia, and the reduced cerebral blood ﬂow observed after cocaine intake, or heart
disorders caused by the drug, such as tachycardia and
ventricular ﬁbrillation.35
the above cited studies show that the neuropharmacological correlates of the addictive and toxic eﬀects of
cocaine occur mainly within the conﬁnes of the cns.
this knowledge has laid the grounds for an extensive
body of pharmacological research aimed at developing a
therapeutic means to alleviate the physical and mental
aﬄictions caused by cocaine abuse.

4. current pharmacotherapies
the development of pharmacotherapy for cocaine
addiction is based on previous strategies designed to
alleviate other chemical dependencies such as alcoholism
and opiate addiction, focusing on the neurobiological
and the behavioral bases of addiction.36 to date, no
pharmacotherapy has been approved by the u.s. food
and drug administration for cocaine dependence, but
two major classes of medications have been investigated:
(1) dopaminergic agents and (2) antidepressants. studies
have been relatively brief for both types of agents and
have focused on abstinence initiation rather than on
relapse prevention. in addition to dopaminergic agents
and antidepressants, other compounds such as calcium
channel blockers, have been examined as potential
treatments of cocaine dependence.
4.1. dopaminergic agents
based on the theory that chronic cocaine use reduces the
eﬃciency of central da neurotransmission (vide supra),

cocaine produces its toxic eﬀects and a variety of other
physiological and behavioral eﬀects through its interactions with several distinct cns receptor sites.
additional to the monoaminergic eﬀects of cocaine,
receptor-binding studies have shown that ())-cocaine
interacts with both sigma and muscarinic cholinergic
receptors in the brain.29 other ﬁndings of interest are
that cocaine does not appear to inhibit ligand binding to
gaba, nmda, phencyclidine, or benzodiazapine
receptors among others, receptors related to neuronal
systems typically associated with seizures, as well as to
the eﬃcacy of various anticonvulsant compounds.29;30
on the cerebral vascular system cocaine seems to act
directly, its action being mediated mainly by the eﬀects
on noradrenergic neurotransmission. cocaine causes
vasoconstriction, decrease in cerebral blood ﬂow,31 and
inﬂammation in the walls of the brain vessels (vasculitis).32;33 other chronic disorders have been associated
with the use of cocaine. among these, partial or gen-

several dopaminergic compounds, including amantadine
(5), bromocriptine (6),  xxxd2546xxx  (7), and methylphenidate (8) (fig. 2), have been examined as treatments for
cocaine abuse. investigators hoped that these dopaminergic agents, which have a fast onset of action, would
correct the da dysregulation and alleviate the withdrawal symptoms that often follow cessation of stimulant use.
a large array of cocaine analogues and other dopamine
uptake inhibitors (see table 2) including analogues of
win-35,065 (9), gbr-12909 (10),  xxxd2746xxx  (11), and
benztropine (12) (fig. 3) have been developed in the last
15 years.37–46 the largest class of compound studies is
the class of 3-phenyltropane analogues, of which many
hundreds have been made and tested. the analogues
rti-112 (13) and ptt (14) (fig. 4) are in preclinical
evaluation. like cocaine, rti-112 and ptt both have
good aﬃnity for all three monoamine transporters, but
in contrast to cocaine they enter the brain slowly and are
long-lasting. a number of other 3-phenyltropanes are
potent and selective for the  xxxg2149xxx  relative to inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine

transporters, are long-lasting, and also enter the brain
more slowly than cocaine,47 for example, rti-113 (15)
and rti-177 (16) (fig. 4).
compounds of the gbr series are also known to be
potent and selective for the  xxxg2149xxx  and
have been considered as viable substitute agonist medications.37;48 preclinical studies of these compounds in
nonhuman primates, however, have also indicated the
potential for abuse in humans,49;50 which may be a
problem with all substitute agonists.
the eﬀect of inhibiting neurotransmitter uptake is to
stimulate neurotransmitter receptors; thus the use of
direct receptor agonists as substitute agonist medications also has been suggested. data on dopamine
receptor agonists have been extensively reviewed. animal studies indicate that dopamine receptor agonists
such as apomorphine (17) (fig. 5) and bromocriptine (6)
maintain self-administration in rodents.51;52
a number of studies have found amantadine (5) to be
eﬀective in attenuating cocaine craving and use. for
instance, in cocaine-abusing methadone-maintained
patients, handelsman et al. reported decreased urine

cocaine metabolite levels and self-reported cocaine use
following amantadine treatment,53 and alterman et al.
found that patients who were given amantadine had
signiﬁcantly greater rates of cocaine abstinence than did
placebo-treated subjects.54 a double-blind comparison
of amantadine and bromocriptine for the treatment of
acute cocaine withdrawal evidenced that amantadine
was superior to bromocriptine.55 however, a placebocontrolled study comparing amantadine and placebo
observed no diﬀerences between the treatment groups.56
amantadine has also been compared with desipramine
(18) (fig. 5) and a placebo. in methadone-maintained
patients, no diﬀerences were found among the three
groups in treatment retention, cocaine craving, and cocaine-free urine samples, but attainment of two weeks of
cocaine abstinence was signiﬁcantly greater in the
amantadine treatment group relative to the desipramine
or placebo groups.57 thus, these studies suggest that
amantadine would be only marginally eﬀective in
reducing cocaine withdrawal symptoms as initial
attainment of cocaine abstinence.
the da d2 agonist bromocriptine (6) also has been
examined in the treatment of cocaine dependence. in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled study with cocainedependent individuals, giannini and billett found that
compared with placebo, bomocriptine signiﬁcantly reduced cocaine craving,58 while another report noted that
bromocriptine blocked the euphorigenic eﬀects of cocaine in several addicted patients.55 despite these positive results, bromocriptine has been reported to produce
side eﬀects such as headache, nausea, hypotension, and
psychosis,59;60 which makes this agent a poor treatment
choice.
 xxxd2546xxx  (7), a catecholamine reuptake inhibitor, was
initially associated with reduced cocaine use,61 but more
recent studies failed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic effects. for instance, in a one-week crossover study,
 xxxd2546xxx  did not reduce cocaine use or craving,62 and in
double-blind studies, no diﬀerences were observed between  xxxd2546xxx  and placebo treatment groups in selfreport ratings, rates of relapse, or cocaine use.63;64
methylphenidate (8), a stimulant, has been examined for
treatment of cocaine dependence because of its low
abuse liability relative to cocaine or amphetamine, rapid
onset of action relative to antidepressants, and long
duration of action relative to cocaine.57 methylphenidate has been reported to produce beneﬁcial eﬀects in
cocaine-dependant individuals with attention-deﬁcit/
hyperactivity disorder (adhd).65 however, others have
found that methylphenidate results in a mild sense of
stimulation that evokes an increased desire for cocaine
in persons without adhd.66 furthermore, a recent
double-blind, placebo-controlled study found no diﬀerence in cocaine use between methylphenidate and placebo treatment groups.67
overall, these studies indicate that the rewarding eﬀect
and withdrawal symptoms induced by cocaine may be
modestly attenuated by fast-acting dopaminergic agents.
however, the signiﬁcant side eﬀects resulting from

alterations to such a preponderant neurochemical system, decrease the medicinal value of these compounds.
4.2. antidepressants
the second class of medications used to treat cocaine
dependence, antidepressants, are thought to downregulate synaptic catecholamine receptors, and this action is
opposite to the presynaptic upregulation caused by
chronic stimulant use.68 although antidepressants have
a relatively benign side-eﬀect proﬁle, good patient
compliance rates, and lack of abuse liability, they have a
delayed onset of action ranging from 10 to 20 days.62
therefore, the physician may consider beginning antidepressant treatment during early withdrawal and
continuing for weeks or longer as clinically indicated.
the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (18) has been
studied most extensively as a treatment of cocaine
dependence. early studies of desipramine to treat cocaine dependence showed positive results,55;68 but placebo-controlled trials have not produced impressive
ﬁndings. a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies
by levin and lehman showed that although desipramine did not improve retention in treatment, it did
produce greater cocaine abstinence relative to placebo.69
however, treatment with desipramine has induced ‘early
tricyclic jitteriness syndrome’ and cocaine craving, as
well as relapse to cocaine use in some patients.70
therefore, desipramine as pharmacotherapy would hold
serious clinical caveats.
additional studies have focused on the involvement of
the 5ht3 receptor subtype in the neuropharmacology of
cocaine, but the results obtained are somewhat inconsistent. several 5ht3-selective antagonists, including
mdl-72222 (19) and ondansetron (20) (fig. 5) were
reported to attenuate cocaine-induced locomotor activity in rodents.71 however, ondansetron failed to block
the reinforcing or discriminative-stimulus eﬀects of cocaine in rodents.72;73
several other antidepressants, including ﬂuoxetine (21),
sertraline (22), and trazodone (23) (fig. 6), that work
predominantly through serotonergic mechanisms also
have been used as pharmacotherapy for cocaine
dependence. although some reports indicated that

blocker isradipine (25).

treatment with ﬂuoxetine reduced cocaine craving and
use in cocaine-abusing heroin addicts,74;75 other investigators have not found ﬂuoxetine to be eﬀective in
attenuating cocaine use and withdrawal symptoms.57;76
bupropion (24) (fig. 7), a ‘second-generation’ antidepressant, has been studied as pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence. in an open pilot study, treatment with
bupropion reduced cocaine use63 and attenuated several
cocaine-induced onsite subjective ratings during laboratory cocaine administration.77 however, another
study failed to show that bupropion produced greater
eﬃcacy than placebo for reducing cocaine’s eﬀects.78
4.3. calcium channel blockers
various studies suggest that l-type calcium channel
blockers potentially reduce the rewarding eﬀects of cocaine. one such compound, the l-type calcium channel
blocker isradipine (25) (fig. 7), attenuated the cocaineinduced dopamine release in the striatum of rats.79
another report described isradipine-induced attenuation
of condition place preference and the discriminativestimulus properties of cocaine.80 also, pretreatment with
isradipine resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in
intravenous cocaine self-administration.81;82 because of
the antihypertensive quality of calcium channel blockers, the potential increase in cardiac output in patients
with normal ventricular function could complicate their
use as pharmacotherapies for cocaine abuse.
notwithstanding the impressive amount of research effort in this area, a large number of studies using dopaminergic drugs have failed to yield encouraging results.
to date, no pharmacotherapeutic agent of this type used
on an experimental basis has been shown eﬀectiveness
that would merit medical implementation.

5. induction of the immune response
the importance of natural immunity has been widely
recognized and deﬁned by the generation or presence of
protective, therapeutic antibodies to infectious or foreign agents.83–85 antibody responses make up the humoral response, and immune protection from disease
can be passively transferred through serum containing
antibodies. antibodies represent a dominant class of
serum proteins; reaching 10 mg/ml in the serum fol-

lowing immunization or during the course of severe
chronic infections, or as a result of proliferative diseases
of antibody producing cells. the major classes of immunoglobulins (ig) include igg, iga, igm, igd, and
ige.86 igg represents the protective, high aﬃnity antibodies circulating in the blood (with a half-life of about
three weeks) with neutralizing activity for infectious
agents, bacteria, viruses or soluble toxins, and target
antigens in general. igg antibodies are large molecules,
having a molecular weight of approximately 150 kda,
are composed of two diﬀerent kinds of polypeptide
chains86 (fig. 8). one, of approximately 50 kda, is
termed the heavy or h chain, and the other, of 25 kda,
is termed the light of l chain. the two heavy chains are
linked to each other by disulﬁde bonds and each heavy
chain is linked to a light chain by a disulﬁde bond. in
any given immunoglobulin molecule, the two heavy
chains and the two light chains are identical, giving an
antibody molecule with two identical antigen-binding
sites, and thus the ability to bind simultaneously to two
identical structures. an antibody is composed of
multiple ig domains. a heavy chain contains four ig
domains, while the light chain has only two. the n
terminal ig domain of a heavy chain and light chain
aligns in the ig molecule and forms the antigen-binding
pocket. one igg molecule has two antigen-binding sites,
and this portion of the protein can be separated from the
constant region by enzymatic digestion, which cleaves
the molecule to the antigen binding f(ab)2 and the
constant fc fragments.86
the peptide sequence of the n terminal ig domain is a
variable property achieved by recombination and somatic mutation mechanisms. the two variable segments
that together make the antigen-binding pocket contain
peptide sequences of key importance in the complementarity determining regions (cdrs) responsible for
interaction with the antigen.87 cdrs represent the most
variable peptide sequences in the ig molecule and are
coded by variation, diverse and joining genomic segments. the total possible combinations of various segments and somatic mutation are responsible for the
diversity of antigen-binding sites that exceeds 106 possible permutations. invariant parts of ig chains are class
igd, igm, ige, iga, and igg subclasses. ig classes diﬀer
in their eﬀector activities, which are associated with the

5026

distal, fc portion of the molecules. speciﬁc ig binding
receptor mediated activation or inhibition of macrophages, granulocytes and mast cells, as well as intestinal,
endothelial and placental transfer of ig molecules are
dependent on various forms of ig class speciﬁc fc
receptors.
igm is the predominant immunoglobulin of the primary
immune response after challenge by an unknown antigen for the very ﬁrst time.86 the pentameric backbone,
with ten antigen-binding sites, is very eﬀective in
agglutination of antigenic particles. moreover, igm is
the most potent isotype in activating the complement
cascade, a system of serum proteins supporting many
immunological functions. the monomeric igm variant
is anchored on the surface of b cells and serves as the
speciﬁc b cell receptor (bcr). together with the surface
igm molecule, igd is coexpressed on the outer membrane of b cells.
igg is the predominant antibody of the secondary immune response.88 it is produced rapidly in high concentrations after meeting an already known antigen.
during the ﬁrst contact, b cells speciﬁc for the appropriate antigen expand and produce igm antibodies.
moreover, a few of these speciﬁc b cells do not proliferate but rather develop into memory cells. the latter
are long living (up to 10 years) cells with the same speciﬁc bcr. these primed cells are ready to react when
the appropriate antigen is presented and they start to
divide into further memory cells and many eﬀector b
cells, producing igg antibodies without having to perform all of those recombination steps. this memory
eﬀect of lymphocytes (the same is true for t lymphocytes) is the basis of successful vaccination.86

6. anti-cocaine haptens developed and preclinical studies
in the last 10 years, a new therapeutic strategy against
cocaine abuse has been explored. this approach entails
the synthesis of a therapeutic cocaine vaccine that induces the production of anti-cocaine antibodies. this

figure 9. schematic representation of anti-cocaine vaccination strategies.

immunogenic response is hypothesized to bind peripherally circulating cocaine, forming a large molecular
complex, impenetrable through the blood–brain barrier,
thus impeding its passage into the cns, where the drug
exerts its addictive eﬀects. as a result, the reinforcing
value of cocaine is expected to decrease, manifested in a
signiﬁcant reduction of relapse behavior (fig. 9).
cocaine itself cannot induce an immune response, but
covalent linkage with a carrier protein makes it a haptenic molecule aﬀording it immunogenic properties. the
carrier protein serves a dual function: it stimulates t-cell
mediated antibody production while providing a scaffolding, rendering cocaine multivalent and able to crosslink immunoglobulin on the surface of b cells. similar
technology is currently used for various conjugate vaccines presently available on the market, including the
series of haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b vaccines, which
couple polysaccharide antigens to protein carriers.89
although several carrier proteins can be used in a conjugate vaccine, cocaine vaccines reported in the last
decade have been synthesized by conjugating a conjugate analog or cocaine itself to klh (keyhole limpet
hemocyanin)4;90 or bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa).91
using this methodology, basagra et al. achieved anticocaine antibody induction in rats, reaching serum levels
ranging from 0.004 to 0.019 mg/ml. in these rats, the
analgesic eﬀects of 25 mg/kg cocaine were reduced.
furthermore, levels of circulating antibody negatively
correlated with the reaction time on the hotplate analgesia test. however, none of the animals showed complete resistance to this single moderate dose of cocaine,
thus it was suggested that the hapten, immunization
dose, and regimen were not optimal. this study was
followed by the ﬁrst successful report of a true blockade
of the psychostimulant eﬀects of cocaine by active
immunization by carrera et al.4 in this study, the cocaine-klh conjugate, gnc-klh (26) (fig. 10), was
shown to suppress locomotor activity and stereotyped
behavior induced by systemic cocaine (15 mg/kg) but not
amphetamine. furthermore, vaccination with gncklh resulted in signiﬁcant decrease of cocaine levels in
brain tissue of up to 80%. in a later report,92 it was
demonstrated that antibody titers rose to over 25,000 in

m. r. a. carrera et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 12 (2004) 5019–5030

figure 10. cocaine-klh immunoconjugates gnc-klh (26) and

rats given three injections of 250 lg gnc-klh over a
ﬁve-week immunization period. this level of antibody
was suﬃcient to block reinstatement of responding induced by a single noncontingent priming infusion of
cocaine, it also proved moderately surmountable when a
threefold increase in cocaine dose was available. upon
ad libitum exposure to cocaine elicited responding of
approximately 200% above baseline. of note, this dramatic rise in responding was entirely blocked by iv
administration of the monoclonal anti-cocaine antibody
(mab) gnc-92h2 at the 15 and 30 mg/kg dose.
importantly, active immunization with gnc-klh resulted in a rightward shift of the ascending limb of the
u-shaped dose–response curve, suggesting that this
treatment possesses true therapeutic potential for the
abatement of cocaine abuse.
subsequent work by this same group developed a secondgeneration cocaine-klh conjugate termed gnd-klh
(27). immunization (3 · 250 lg over ﬁve weeks) resulted
in a dramatic suppressing of the psychomotor stimulant
eﬀects of 15 mg/kg cocaine.93 as this eﬀect was sustained
for up to 12 days after immunization, gnd-klh was an
important improvement over gnc-klh by oﬀering
longer-term protection against cocaine. as the antagonistic eﬀects of the immunization protocol were not
absolute, it was concluded that the anti-cocaine antibody
titers generated by this treatment are still surmountable
by increasing doses of the drug. however, to date these
data reﬂect the most signiﬁcant blockade of cocaine by
any immunotherapeutic means. other groups implemented similar cocaine-klh haptens in the eﬀorts to
blunt the analgesic eﬀects of the drug, meeting with limited success.94;95 in these studies, cocaine was bound to
klh for immunization with a photoactivatable crosslinker (n-hydroxysuccinimide-4-azidobenzoate). this
conjugation method likely resulted in several diﬀerent
orientations of the exposed cocaine molecule, possibly
resulting in a broad spectrum of anti-cocaine antibodies.
immunization with this cocaine-klh complex resulted
in a marginally attenuating eﬀect of the analgesic and
reinforcing properties of cocaine in laboratory rodents.
a later study by fox et al. tested the eﬀect of an anticocaine vaccine termed ip-1010 (3 · 10 lg over six
weeks) in rats trained to self-administer 1 mg/kg cocaine,
at various doses of the drug.91 serum antibody levels

5027

ranged from 0.008 to 0.709 mg/ml two weeks after the
last vaccine injection. only rats having serum antibody
levels greater than 0.05 mg/ml displayed attenuated
drug-seeking behavior and drug infusions across the
range of doses examined. the ascending limb of the
inverted u-shaped dose–response curve was shifted to
the right for both drug-seeking behavior and number of
drug infusions earned, suggesting that immunization
with the cocaine vaccine antagonized the reinforcing
eﬀects of cocaine in this group of animals. however,
valid concerns were raised with regard to the schedule of
reinforcement and behavioral paradigm implemented
for this,96 which makes the interpretation of these data
controversial.
there is clearly a need for new treatment options for
cocaine addiction because the relapse rate among drug
abusers seeking treatment is quite high. the described
preclinical studies oﬀer an optimistic scenario for the
successful application of this therapeutic approach. it
will remain to be seen if clinical trials demonstrate the
safety and eﬃcacy of treating cocaine addiction with
immunopharmacotherapy.57

7. other nonpharmacological cocaine-blocking agents
in addition to both active immunization and passive
administration of monoclonal antibodies used to develop potential protein-based therapies for cocaine
addiction, other approaches involving peripheral modiﬁcations to the cocaine molecule have been explored.
one such approach entails the destruction of cocaine
before it has a chance of reaching the brain. an alternative form of passive immunization is the passive
transfer of monoclonal catalytic antibodies that bind
cocaine and subsequently hydrolyze the alkaloid into its
inactive products ecognine methyl ester and benzoic
acid (fig. 11). the unique feature of this preparation is
that after it hydrolyzes cocaine and releases its metabolites, the antibody becomes free for further binding.
to obtain antibodies able to catalyze this reaction, a
transition-state (ts) analogue approach for hapten
design has been reported,5–7 and these immunogens
would elicit the ﬁrst enzymes able to degrade cocaine in
vitro. in this model, the benzoyl ester at c-3 of the
cocaine framework is replaced by a phenylphosphonate
moiety (28) that approximates the ts for ester
hydrolysis.
using a ts analogue strategy, a catalytic antibody
(mab15a10) was developed, which catalyzed the
hydrolysis of cocaine to inactive  xxxd628xxx .
in a model of cocaine overdose, mab15a10 protected
rats from cocaine-induced seizures and sudden death in
a cocaine dose-dependent fashion.97 as further proof of
the concept, the  xxxd628xxx  concentration
was increased more than 10-fold in the plasma of rats
treated with the monoclonal antibodies. in a model of
cocaine self-administration, mab15a10 completely
blocked the reinforcing eﬀects of cocaine in rats. these

figure 11. hydrolysis of cocaine by catalytic antibodies; transition-state analogue 28.

preclinical ﬁndings can be considered as proof of the
general concept, but the approach needs further clinical
development and evaluation.
another protein-based approach to cocaine addiction
treatment is via enhancing cocaine metabolism with
naturally occurring enzymes such as human liver carboxylesterases  xxxg430xxx  and hce-2, and  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ).98;8  xxxg248xxx  is a major cocaine-metabolizing
enzyme present in the plasma of humans and other
mammals.8 intravenous pretreatment of rats with
5000 iu of horse serum-derived  xxxg248xxx  followed by
administration of 17 mg/kg cocaine (intraperitoneally)
produced a signiﬁcant attenuation of cocaine-reduced
locomotor activity. in a further proof of this approach,
 xxxg248xxx  altered the cocaine metabolic pattern to yield the
nontoxic metabolite  xxxd628xxx , instead of
the usual benzoylecgonine metabolite. however, systemic administration of  xxxg248xxx  compares unfavorably
to other pharmacokinetic approaches to attenuating
cocaine action including active immunization4;91 and
catalytic antibodies.7 although, unlike active immunization, which takes weeks to generate a useful antibody
titer,  xxxg248xxx  or cocaine antibody administration can
produce protective eﬀects within minutes after intravenous administration; active immunization however may
be more eﬀective at retarding cocaine from entering the
cns since these antibodies would be of higher aﬃnity
for cocaine.
an important caveat to this approach, however, is that
the speciﬁcity rate constants ðkcat =km þ of these cocainehydrolytic human esterases are several orders of magnitude below a diﬀusion-limited rate.99;100 not having
evolved under selection pressure for cocaine hydrolysis,
these enzymes accept cocaine serendipitously as part of a
broad range of substrates. it therefore follows, that an
enzyme, which has evolved to speciﬁcally hydrolyze
cocaine would likely have a faster rate than esterases
such as  xxxg430xxx , hce-2, and  xxxg248xxx . a recently characterized bacterial cocaine esterase, coce, was reported to
hydrolyze cocaine faster than any other described cocaine esterase. hydrolysis of the cocaine benzoyl ester
was found to proceed with a kcat ¼ 7:8 s1 and
km ¼ 640 nm. isolated from rhodococcal strain ( xxxg1862xxx )
that grows in the rhizosphere soil of the cocaine producing plant erythroxylum coca, coce is one of only
two known enzymes that are believed to have evolved

under selection pressure for cocaine hydrolysis.101 coce
catalyzes hydrolysis of the benzoyl ester of cocaine as
the ﬁrst step in a metabolic pathway that is capable of
utilizing cocaine as the only source of carbon and
nitrogen.102 with a speciﬁcity rate constant that is orders
of magnitude faster than any other known cocaine
hydrolyzing enzyme or catalytic antibody, the absence
of observable product inhibition and the ability to accept both cocaine and cocaethylene as substrates, coce
proﬁles as a promising addition to the generation of
cocaine catalytic antibodies for addiction therapy. the
success of its implementation in animal models of drug
abuse and the hapten design to elicit cocaine catalytic
antibodies remain to be examined.
8. conclusion
advances in our understanding of the underlying biology
of cocaine addiction are aﬀording new venues to procure
the development of a still elusive eﬀective therapy against
this disease. undoubtedly, the greatest challenge in this
scientiﬁc endeavor is the inherent multifaceted nature of
cocaine abuse with its complex psychosocial and neuropharmacological components. immunotherapeutic
strategies described herein oﬀer a means with which to
safely and eﬀectively address relapse behavior, the most
self-perpetuating component of cocaine dependence. still
with important challenges to overcome, such as titer
surmountability and improved binding aﬃnity, immunopharmacotherapy appears to be, to date, the most
promising tool to address cocaine abuse, in concert with
complementary therapeutic strategies that address the
complex nature of this social aﬄiction.

m. rocı́o a. carrera was born 29 december 1964 in acapulco, mexico. she earned her m.a. degree in psychology form the university of
california san diego (1991), working on the biological basis of
ingestive behavior with dr. anthony j. deutsch, speciﬁcally the satiety
properties of cholecystokinin. she continued her training with dr.
george f. koob at the scripps research institute where she was aptly
trained in neuropsychopharmacological assays to investigate the neural mechanisms of various drugs of abuse, including cocaine, heroin,
cannabinoids, nicotine, and amphetamine. currently she has a predoctoral fellowship from nida and is a graduate student in professor
kim d. janda’s laboratory. her research interests have spanned the
ﬁeld of immunopharmacotherapy, speciﬁcally with regards to cocaine
abuse, her main research interest to date.

kim d. janda was born 23 august 1957 in cleveland, ohio. he obtained his b.s. degree in clinical chemistry from the university of
south florida (1980) and his ph.d. in organic chemistry from the
university of arizona (1984). he joined the scripps research institute
in 1985 as a postdoctoral fellow and, in 1987, was promoted to the
faculty, where he is currently the ely r. callaway, jr. professor of
chemistry. his research interests include catalytic antibodies, polymer
supported methodologies, combinatorial chemistry/phage display systems, immunopharmacotherapy for the treatment of drug abuse and
cancer, physiologically relevant reactivity of nicotine metabolites,
protein–protein interactions, and quorum sensing. he is the recipient
of an alfred p. sloan fellowship (1993–1995) and the arthur c. cope
scholar award (1999).

michael m. meijler was born 12 december 1970 in amsterdam, the
netherlands. he earned his m.sc. degree in chemistry from the university of amsterdam (1996), where he worked with prof. gerrit-jan
koomen on the synthesis of brominated indole alkaloids. he interrupted his m.sc. project in the winter of 1995 to work with the late
professor david sigman at the university of california, los angeles,
on the mechanism of dna scission by chemical nucleases. he then
moved to israel to work with professor abraham shanzer at the
weizmann institute of science on the synthesis and evaluation of
siderophore analogs. after receiving his ph.d. in 2002, he joined the
group of professor kim d. janda at the scripps research institute,
where his main research interests are in the area of bioorganic chemistry, and the interplay between synthetic organic chemistry, microbiology, and immunology.
