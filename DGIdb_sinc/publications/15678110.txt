the transcription factor nf-jb is a key regulator of inflammation and cell survival. nf-jb is activated
by cerebral ischemia in neurons and glia, but its function is controversial. to inhibit nf-jb
selectively in neurons and glial cells, we have generated transgenic mice that express the ijba
superrepressor (ijba mutated at serine-32 and serine-36, ijba-sr) under transcriptional control of
the  xxxg702xxx  (nse) and the  xxxg883xxx  (gfap) promoter,
respectively. in primary cortical neurons of nse-ijba-sr mice, nf-jb activity was partially inhibited.
to assess nf-jb activity in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao), we
measured the expression of nf-jb target genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the
induction of c-myc and transforming growth factor-b2 by cerebral ischemia was inhibited by
neuronal expression of ijba-sr, whereas induction of gfap by mcao was reduced by astrocytic
expression of ijba-sr. neuronal, but not astrocytic, expression of the nf-jb inhibitor reduced both
infarct size and cell death 48 hours after permanent mcao. in summary, the data show that nf-jb is
activated in neurons and astrocytes during cerebral ischemia and that nf-jb activation in neurons
contributes to the ischemic damage.

introduction
the central nervous system reacts to noxious stimuli
with a complex genomic response. recent advances
in expression profiling have identified hundreds of
genes that are upregulated on damage to brain
tissue. in an attempt to investigate transcriptional
programs rather than individual genes, the functional role of transcriptional activators has been
studied in various paradigms of brain damage. in the
case of cerebral ischemia, there is clear evidence for
the activation of transcription factors such as
hypoxia inducible factor, interferon regulatory factor
1, and  xxxg1559xxx  (bergeron et al, 1999; iadecola et al,
1999; schneider et al, 1999; stephenson et al, 2000).

originally,  xxxg1559xxx  was discovered in an immunologic context but it is also present in the brain
(o’neill and kaltschmidt, 1997). five subunits, p50,
p52, p65 (rela), relb, and c-rel, form homo- and
heterodimers. in an inactive state,  xxxg1559xxx  dimers are
sequestered in the cytoplasm by the specific inhibitors  xxxg1561xxx , ikbb, and ikbe. on stimulation, ikb is
phosphorylated by the ikb kinase (ikk) complex,
ubiquitinated, and then degraded by the 26s
proteasome. however, there are also pathways of
 xxxg1559xxx  activation that are independent of ikk or the
proteasome (bui et al, 2001; schölzke et al, 2003). in
cerebral ischemia, most investigators found activation of  xxxg1559xxx  in neurons (huang et al, 2001;
schneider et al, 1999; stephenson et al, 2000). in
addition, there is also evidence for the activation of
 xxxg1559xxx  in endothelial and glial cells during cerebral
ischemia (carroll et al, 1998; gabriel et al, 1999;
terai et al, 1996).  xxxg1559xxx  activity in the brain
consists mainly of the subunits p50 and p65 (rela).
to show the functional significance of  xxxg1559xxx 
activation, we previously used p50-deficient mice.
a reduced infarct size in the absence of p50
suggested that  xxxg1559xxx  is involved in ischemic brain
damage (nurmi et al, 2004; schneider et al, 1999).
however, further interpretation of this result is

complicated because p50 both represses and transactivates gene transcription, depending on the
dimerization partner, the promoter, and cell type
that are studied (franzoso et al, 1992; kang et al,
1992; kurland et al, 2001). moreover, the absence of
p50 in all cells and tissues of the body causes slight
defects in immune responses (sha et al, 1995) and
potentially also other as yet unknown systemic
effects (e.g., changed levels of proinflammatory
cytokines released from endothelial cells during
ischemia), which might influence ischemic brain
damage indirectly. to obtain more definite evidence
for the functional significance of  xxxg1559xxx  activation in
cerebral ischemia, we have now generated transgenic mice that express a specific dominant inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx  activation under transcriptional
control of neuron- or astrocyte-specific promoters.
as a dominant inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx , we used  xxxg1561xxx 
mutated at the phosphorylation sites for ikk (serine32 and serine-36,  xxxg1561xxx  superrepressor,  xxxg1561xxx -sr),
which has been successfully used as a transgene
before (hettmann et al, 1999; vallabhapurapu et al,
2001). our results show that selective inhibition
of  xxxg1559xxx  in neurons reduces ischemic cerebral
damage.

materials and methods

body weight. a skin incision was made between the ear
and the orbit on the left side. the parotid gland and the
temporal muscle were removed by electrical coagulation.
the stem of the middle cerebral artery (mca) was exposed
through a burr hole and was occluded by microbipolar
coagulation (erbe, tübingen, germany). surgery was
performed under a microscope (hund, wetzlar, germany).
mice were kept at a body temperature of 371c on a heating
pad. after 48 hours they were deeply reanesthetized with
avertin and perfused intracardially with ringer’s solution.
brains were removed and immediately frozen on dry ice.
coronal cryosections (20 mm) were cut every 400 mm,
starting rostrally. sections were stained with a silver
technique to determine the infarct size (herrmann et al,
2003). stained sections were scanned at 600 dpi and the
infarct area was measured (scnimage, scion, frederick,
md, usa). the total infarct volume was obtained from
integrating infarcted areas corrected for brain edema
(swanson et al, 1990). surgery and infarct measurement
were obtained without a knowledge of the genotype. for
the measurement of physiologic parameters in a subgroup
of mice, the right femoral artery was cannulated. samples
(100 ml per mouse) were collected for analysis of arterial
blood gas, hemoglobin, and glucose. for laser doppler
measurements, the probe (p415-205; perimed, järfälla,
sweden) was placed 3 mm lateral and 6 mm posterior to
the bregma. relative perfusion units were determined
(periflux 4001; perimed, järfälla, sweden).

generation of transgenic mice
the  xxxg1561xxx -sr transgene is preceded by the b-globin
initiation signal to maximize translation efficiency and
by a t7 tag to facilitate detection (vallabhapurapu et al,
2001). a 2.1-kb fragment of the human growth hormone
gene downstream of the cdna provides intron and
polyadenylation sequences. a 1.8-kb fragment of the rat
 xxxg702xxx  (nse) promoter, which has been
shown to direct gene transcription into neurons (forsspetter et al, 1990), was inserted 50 to the  xxxg1561xxx -sr cdna
(pnse- xxxg1561xxx -sr). to construct pgfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr (gfap:
 xxxg883xxx ), the nse promoter was
replaced by a 2.2-kb dna fragment of the human gfap
promoter that was derived from the plasmid pegfp-gfap
(nolte et al, 2001). this promoter directs transgene
expression into astrocytes (brenner et al, 1994; nolte et al,
2001). transgenic mice were obtained by pronuclear
injection into oocytes that were derived from female f1
hybrids (c57bl/6  dba2/crl) and male c57bl/6 mice.
founders were backcrossed for four to six generations on a
c57bl/6 background. genomic dna obtained from tail
biopsies was tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
using the following primers resulting in a pcr product
of 233 bp: nm-map1, 50 -cct  xxxg889xxx  ttc act agc aac ctc aaa
cag aca cc; nm-map2, 50 -gta atc ctc gtc ctt cat ggc gtc caa
gcc ggc-30 .

immunohistochemistry
coronal cryosections (10 mm) were prepared and air-dried
for 1 hour. they were fixed in acetone (201c) for 2 mins,
air-dried again, and blocked with biotin-blocking solution
for 20 mins and with peroxidase-blocking reagent for 5
mins (dako, hamburg, germany). for staining of the t7
epitope, a monoclonal mouse anti-t7 antibody (novagen,
madison, wi, usa) was prelabeled with biotin using
dako ark (dako, hamburg, germany). sections were
incubated overnight at 41c with biotin-labeled anti-t7
(2.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). for
detection of the anti-t7 antibody, a streptavidin–peroxidase complex (ark, dako, hamburg, germany) was
used. peroxidase was visualized with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (dab). for immunohistochemistry of neurofilament200 kda, a rabbit anti-neurofilament-200 kda antibody
(1:500, sigma, munich, germany) was used. after washing
with pbs, sections were incubated with an alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:80,
dako, hamburg, germany) for 30 mins at room temperature. alkaline phosphatase was visualized with 5-bromo4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate/nitroblue
tetrazolium
(bcip/nbt).

real-time rt-pcr
middle cerebral artery occlusion
at an age of 4 to 8 months, male mice were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection of 150 ml 2.5% avertin per 10 g

mice were reanesthetized and perfused with ringer’s
solution 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(mcao); the ischemic and the corresponding contralateral
cortices were quickly dissected and frozen on dry ice.

tissues were stored at 801c. rna was extracted with
peqgold rnapure (peqlab, erlangen, germany),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in total
10 mg rna was transcribed with mmlv reverse transcriptase and random hexamers. primers for the quantitative
real-time pcr are listed in table 1. polymerase chain
reaction was performed according to the following protocol: 10 mins at 951c, 15 secs at 951c, and 1 minute at 601c
(40 cycles). amplification was quantified with the gene
amp 5700 sequence detector and the sybr green kit
(pe diagnostik, weiterstadt, germany). a linear concentration–response curve was established by diluting
pooled samples. quantified results for individual cdnas
were normalized to mean levels for glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ),  xxxg798xxx , and
b-actin. the purity of the amplified products was checked
by the dissociation curve.

tunel staining
for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 20 deoxyuridine 50 -triphosphate nick end labeling (tunel)
staining, sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
room temperature for 30 mins. then sections were washed
twice in pbs for 5 mins and permeabilized for 2 mins with
200 ml permeabilization solution (0.1% triton x-100 and
0.1% sodium citrate in pbs) at 41c. after washing,
sections were incubated with 50 ml tunel reaction mix
(enzyme solution diluted 1:6 in labeling solution; in situ
cell detection kit, fluorescein, roche, mannheim,
germany) for 1 hour at 371c in the dark. then sections
were mounted with medium containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole dihydrochloride (dapi, vectashield). tuneland dapi-positive cells were detected with a fluorescence
microscope. in three fields of 0.04 mm2 at the dorsal,
ventral, and middle border of the infarct at the level of the
anterior commissure, tunel-positive cells and dapipositive nuclei were counted. tunel-positive cells were
expressed as percent of total cell count. cells were
quantified without a knowledge of the genotype.

immunoblot
tissue lysates (in 50 m mol/l tris-hcl, ph 7.0, 1% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 2% 2- xxxd26xxx ) were
resolved by 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
journal of cerebral blood flow & metabolism (2005) 25, 30–40

and transferred to hybond nitrocellulose (amersham,
freiburg, germany). membranes were rinsed in tbst
(20 m mol/l tris-hcl, ph 7.6, 150 m mol/l nacl, 0.1%
tween 20), incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in
tbst for 2 hours, and then incubated with rabbit antiikba antibodies (0.4 mg/ml, santa cruz, heidelberg,
germany) or mouse anti-t7 (0.3 ng/ml, novagen, madison,
wi, usa) in tbst. antibody–antigen complexes were detected with ecl reagents (amersham, freiburg, germany).

cell culture and transfection
cortical neurons were derived from embryonic day 16
(e16) mice. the cells from individual brains were
dissociated and cultured in 24-well plates precoated with
poly-d-lysine (50 mg/ml) at a density of 200,000 cells/well.
these cells were then incubated in neurobasal medium
(invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) supplemented with b27
(invitrogen), 0.5 m mol/l l-glutamine, penicillin (100 iu/ml),
and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). after 10 days in vitro, cells
were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen)
and 1 mg/well of the  xxxg1559xxx  reporter plasmid pnf-kb-luc
comprising five tandem repeats of  xxxg1559xxx  binding sites
(stratagene, amsterdam, netherlands), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. after 24 hours, cells were
stimulated as indicated and harvested. to control for cell
viability after stimulation with 10 mm  xxxd412xxx , cells
were cotransfected with 0.1 mg/well of the reference
plasmid phrl-tk (promega, mannheim, germany).
renilla luciferase was measured with the dual-luciferase
reporter assay, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(promega). firefly luciferase activity was measured
as described (sallmann et al, 2000). cell death was
quantified after 16 hours of exposure to 10 m mol/l
 xxxd412xxx  by staining neurons with vectashield and
counting the cells with condensed and normal nuclei.
the preparation and culture of primary mouse astrocytes has been described before (schwaninger et al, 2000).
cells were transfected with pnf-kb-luc (2 mg/6-cm well)
and gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr using transfast (promega, mannheim,
germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
cotransfections were performed with a constant dna
concentration, which was maintained by adding pbluescript (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). at 42 hours after
transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 hours and
harvested.

in figure 1. for selective inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  in
neurons or astrocytes, the superrepressor of  xxxg1559xxx 
 xxxg1561xxx -sr was put under transcriptional control of the
rat 1.8-kb, neuron-specific nse or the human 2.2-kb,
astrocyte-specific gfap promoter, respectively. to
verify that the t7-tagged, mutated form of  xxxg1561xxx 
( xxxg1561xxx -sr) acts as an inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx , we transfected the construct pgfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr together with
an  xxxg1559xxx  reporter gene into primary mouse astrocytes.  xxxg1559xxx  activity stimulated by phorbol
12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (tpa) plus thapsigargin
was inhibited by expression of  xxxg1561xxx -sr in a dosedependent manner (figure 2).
we obtained three founders for the nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr
construct and four founders for the gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr
construct. two founder lines for each construct were
further investigated (nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr211, nse-ikbasr241, gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr211, gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr192). the
transgenes did not have any obvious effect on
behavior or breeding nor was gross brain morphology altered by the transgene (data not shown).
the transgenic  xxxg1561xxx -sr has a higher molecular
weight than the endogenous form because of the t7
tag. this allowed a direct comparison of the
expression of transgenic and endogenous  xxxg1561xxx  by
immunoblotting. transgenic  xxxg1561xxx -sr levels in brain
extracts were lower than endogenous  xxxg1561xxx  in all
transgenic lines (figure 3a). the specificity of the
band in immunoblots was confirmed by detection of
the transgene with an antibody against t7 (figure
3a). transgene expression was restricted to the
brain and could not be detected in heart, kidney,
liver, or spleen (data not shown).
the cell specificity of the transgene expression in
nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr mice was further verified by immunohistochemistry. the neuronal cell layer of the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus that expresses
the neuronal marker neurofilament-200 was also
stained by an antibody against the transgene epitope
t7 (figure 3b). in addition, neurons in the granular
layer of the cerebellum and in the cortex were
positive for the t7 marker (not shown). primary
cortical neurons in vitro expressed the transgene as
shown by immunoblots of cell extracts (figure 4a).
to test whether transgene expression interferes with
 xxxg1559xxx  activation, we used a reporter gene assay in
primary cortical neurons from mice with the nseikba-sr transgene and from wild-type littermates.
 xxxg1559xxx -driven luciferase expression was stimulated
by 10 ng/ml  xxxg2296xxx , a classical  xxxg1559xxx  inducer. in
cortical neurons from transgenic mice,  xxxg1559xxx 
activation was preserved, but was significantly
lower (figure 4b). to investigate the effect of nfkb inhibition on neuronal cell survival, we used
 xxxd412xxx , a dna-damaging agent (park et al,
1997). dna damage is an important component of
the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, well in
advance of dna fragmentation caused by the
apoptotic process (chen et al, 1997; cui et al,
2000; tobita et al, 1995).  xxxd412xxx  (10 m mol/l

 xxxd412xxx  exposure for 16 h also induced
neuronal apoptosis that was quantified by counting
cells with condensed nuclei. in prior experiments
nuclear condensation corresponded closely to
tunel staining. the percentage of apoptotic neurons was significantly smaller in primary cortical
cultures expressing the transgene  xxxg1561xxx -sr (figure
4c). thus, in primary neurons of nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr mice,
the transgene is expressed and inhibits  xxxg1559xxx 
activation and apoptosis.
to evaluate the effect of the  xxxg1561xxx -sr transgene on
 xxxg1559xxx  activation in vivo, we measured mrna
accumulation of specific  xxxg1559xxx  target genes in the
cortex by real-time rt-pcr. the promoter of the
c-myc gene contains two functional  xxxg1559xxx  sites and
the transforming growth factor-b2 (tgf-b2) promoter contains a putative  xxxg1559xxx  site (duyao et al, 1990;
la rosa et al, 1994; malipiero et al, 1990). both
c-myc and tgf-b2 are known to be induced in
neurons by cerebral ischemia (ata et al, 1999; huang
et al, 2001). middle cerebral artery occlusion for 24
hours induced a significant increase in the mrna
concentration of c-myc and tgf-b2 in wild-type
mice (figures 5a, b). however, in nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr
mice, mcao did not stimulate mrna levels of

figure 6 neuronal, but not astrocytic, expression of the  xxxg1559xxx  inhibitor  xxxg1561xxx -sr reduces the infarct size. after 48 hours of
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao), infarct areas were determined on consecutive coronal brain sections using silver
staining. typical sections at the level of the anterior commissure are shown at the top. infarct areas of nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr211 mice, gfapikba-sr192 mice, or the respective wild-type littermates (wt) are plotted from rostral to caudal. values are means7s.d. (n ¼ 12 to
15) of the average infarct area on two consecutive coronal brain sections. the anterior commissure is seen on section 10. *po0.05
compared with wt (anova, lsd post hoc test).

(data not shown). these data indicate a partial but
significant inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  activity in astrocytes
and neurons in the respective transgenic line.
to investigate the consequences of cell typespecific inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  on ischemic damage,
we compared the infarct size in  xxxg1561xxx  transgenic lines
and wild-type littermates after 48-hour mcao. in
nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr211 mice, the infarct size was significantly smaller (26 %) than in controls (figure 6, left
panel; 18.872.4 mm3 (n ¼ 15) in nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr211
versus 25.472.1 mm3 (n ¼ 12) in controls; po0.05).
to exclude an insertional effect of the transgene, the
experiment was repeated with another founder line
(nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr241) expressing the same transgene. in
this line, infarct size was also significantly smaller
than in wild-type littermates (reduction by 43%,
n ¼ 10; po0.05). physiologic parameters during the
surgery did not differ between nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr mice
and wild-type littermates. in addition, the reduction
in cerebral blood flow between groups was nearly
identical (table 2). in contrast to nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr lines,
the infarct size in two gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr mouse lines
did not differ from controls (gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr192,
figure 6, right panel; gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr211, data not
shown). these data demonstrate that inhibition of
 xxxg1559xxx  in neurons, but not in astrocytes, reduces the
infarct size after permanent mcao.
one possible explanation for the observed reduction in infarct size is protection of neurons against
ischemic cell death. staining with the fluorescent
dye fluoro-jade b, which specifically marks dying
neurons but does not distinguish between necrotic
journal of cerebral blood flow & metabolism (2005) 25, 30–40

and apoptotic neurons (schmued and hopkins,
2000), showed slightly reduced neuronal cell death
in the outer zone of the infarct in nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr mice,
but this did not reach statistical significance (data
not shown). tunel staining is considered to be
more specific for apoptotic cell death than fluorojade b. in accordance with this notion, only about
40% of fluoro-jade b-positive cells were tunel
positive. the number of tunel-positive cells was
significantly reduced in infarcts of nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr
mice. in gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr mice, there was a slight
reduction in the number of tunel-positive cells
that did not reach statistical significance (figure 7,
p ¼ 0.075). previous work has shown that, after
mcao, most tunel-positive cells in the brain are
neurons (schneider, 1999). these data support the
concept that  xxxg1559xxx  in neurons contributes to the
induction of apoptotic neuronal cell death.

discussion
to investigate the contribution of the transcription
factor  xxxg1559xxx  to brain pathology, we have generated
mice that express the  xxxg1559xxx  superrepressor  xxxg1561xxx -sr
under transcriptional control of an nse and an
astrocyte-specific promoter (gfap). mice with
neuronal and astrocytic expression of the superrepressor have an apparently normal phenotype,
although formal behavioral tests have not yet been
performed. in addition, body weight was the same
as in littermates. transgene expression effectively

inhibitor  xxxg1561xxx -sr reduces ischemic cell death. tunel-positive
cells were counted at the border of the infarct at the level of the

cells. values are means7s.d. (n ¼ 5 for nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr and

reduced the induction of neuron- or astrocytespecific target genes of  xxxg1559xxx  after mcao. however,
only neuronal expression of  xxxg1561xxx -sr interfered with
infarct volume after 48 hours of permanent mcao.
the neuroprotective effect of neuronal  xxxg1561xxx -sr was
reproduced in another founder line. our data
provide definitive evidence for the detrimental role
of  xxxg1559xxx  during the pathogenesis of stroke. previous
transgenic approaches could not clarify this point
because deficiency of p65, the main transactivating
subunit of  xxxg1559xxx  in the brain, causes embryonic
death (beg et al, 1995) and the use of p50/ mice is
obscured by reports that p50 can both activate and
repress  xxxg1559xxx  activity. future work will have to
investigate whether inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  also leads to
a long-term reduction of the infarct size.

several investigators have found that  xxxg1559xxx  is
activated in neurons after cerebral ischemia (huang
et al, 2001; schneider et al, 1999; stephenson et al,
2000). however, previous in vitro work of the role of
 xxxg1559xxx  in neuronal cell death only provided ambiguous results in contrast to nonneuronal cell types.
several studies have found an antiapoptotic effect of
 xxxg1559xxx  in neurons in vitro (reviewed in mattson and
camandola, 2001). however,  xxxg1559xxx  can also promote neuronal cell death in vitro (de erausquin et al,
2003; pizzi et al, 2002; qin et al, 1999). indeed,
cortical neurons expressing the  xxxg1559xxx  superrepressor were partially protected against camptothecininduced apoptosis (figure 4c). using the same
superrepressor of  xxxg1559xxx , fridmacher et al (2003)
recently observed that inhibition of neuronal  xxxg1559xxx 
reduced spontaneous cell death but increased
feso4-induced cell death in vitro. whether the
effect is pro- or anti-apoptotic depends on the
stimulus, the cell type, the activated subunits, and
the duration of  xxxg1559xxx  activation (kaltschmidt et al,
2002; pizzi et al, 2002; ryan et al, 2000). in the
ischemic brain, multiple potential stimuli of  xxxg1559xxx 
are released, which makes it difficult to predict the
net effect on  xxxg1559xxx  activation from in vitro data. our
results show in vivo that neuronal activation of
 xxxg1559xxx  in cerebral ischemia contributes to ischemic
brain damage. possibly, the neuroprotective effect of
the super-repressor is due to the moderate expression level in our mouse lines because there is
evidence that a critical  xxxg1559xxx  dosage is required
for cell survival and either too much or too little
activation is detrimental (goudeau et al, 2003).
numerous target genes of  xxxg1559xxx  are upregulated
in cerebral ischemia. candidates, which may mediate the toxic effect of  xxxg1559xxx  in neurons, are c-myc
and tgf-b2 (ata et al, 1999; huang et al, 2001).
c-myc functions as a proapoptotic regulator in cells
of various types and under a variety of conditions
(packham and cleveland, 1995). it has been linked
to n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor- and
journal of cerebral blood flow & metabolism (2005) 25, 30–40

neuronal nf-jb in cerebral ischemia

38

 xxxg1559xxx -mediated apoptosis in neurons (qin et al,
1999). administration of tgf-b1 has been reported
to protect against focal cerebral ischemia (prehn
et al, 1993). however, endogenous tgf-b is required
in vivo for apoptosis of axotomized motoneurons as
shown by the application of neutralizing antibodies
(krieglstein et al, 2000).
in gfap- xxxg1561xxx -sr mice, expression of the transgene  xxxg1561xxx -sr in astrocytes apparently inhibited nfkb activity because the upregulation of gfap was
reduced (figure 3).  xxxg883xxx  is a
marker of astroglia activation and a target gene of
 xxxg1559xxx  (krohn et al, 1999), implying a role of  xxxg1559xxx 
in glial activation in vivo. however, inhibition of
astrocytic  xxxg1559xxx  had no effect on infarct size. a
neuroprotective function of gfap has been reported
in cerebral ischemia (nawashiro et al, 2000). nevertheless, the moderate inhibition of gfap induction
in our mice had no detrimental effect or was
overridden by the effect on other target genes.
regulation of the endogenous gfap gene suggests
that  xxxg1561xxx -sr, which is directed by the human gfap
promoter, also exerts negative feedback on its own
expression but is still upregulated in ischemic
cortex compared to the nonischemic side.
pharmacological studies support our concept of
the neurodegenerative function of  xxxg1559xxx  in cerebral
ischemia although the inherent unspecificity of
drugs only provides correlative evidence. the
antioxidant ly341122 (stephenson et al, 2000), the
salicylate  xxxd3435xxx  (acarin et al, 2001), the proteasome inhibitor mln519 (williams et al, 2003), the
ubiquitin ligase inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (hayakawa et al, 2003; nurmi et al, 2004), and
the cannabinoid dexanabinol (jüttler et al, 2004) all
inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation and exert neuroprotective
effects in cerebral ischemia. the most specific step
in the  xxxg1559xxx  signaling is the activation of the ikk
complex (li and verma, 2002). because the mutation
of ikk phosphorylation sites in  xxxg1561xxx  prevents
degradation of  xxxg1561xxx  and inhibits  xxxg1559xxx , our results
from nse- xxxg1561xxx -sr transgenic mice suggest that
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  through ikk is a critical step
in cerebral ischemia. pharmacological ikk inhibitors might, therefore, represent a specific and
effective treatment of stroke.
