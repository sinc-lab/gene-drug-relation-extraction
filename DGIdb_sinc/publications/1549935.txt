clinical studies have indicated that a low dos of the dopamine dp-receptor antagonist  xxxd1945xxx  given
epidurally potentiate the antinociceptive effect of epidural morphine. the present study was conducted in
order to evaluate this drug interaction in a rat model. rats were given morphine and  xxxd1945xxx  intrathecally
in several combinations of doses. it was found that  xxxd1945xxx  had no antinociceptive effect by itself, nor in
combination with morphine. it was also shown that  xxxd1945xxx  and morphine exert no histopathological
effects on the rat spinal cord. this discrepancy between clinical endings and experimental pain studies
suggests different modes of action of  xxxd1945xxx  in the two situations.

key words: analgesia; dopaminergic receptors;  xxxd1945xxx ; intrathecal; morphine; morphometrics; neurotoxicity; rat.

in open clinical trials it has been demonstrated that a
small dose of  xxxd1945xxx  administered epidurally in
man potentiates the antinociceptive effect of simultaneously administered epidural morphine (1, 2). our
own clinical findings in a small number of patients
suffering from cancer-related pain support this observation (unpublished data). parvis et al. have demonstrated that epidural  xxxd1945xxx  reduces the side-effects
of epidurally administered morphine in the postoperative situation, but no additional analgesia could be
detected ( 3 ) .
 xxxd1945xxx  is a dopamine d,-receptor antagonist.
the role of dopaminergic nerves in central pain processing has been poorly investigated. there is experimental evidence, however, that dopamine d,-ugonists
administered intrathecally (4)or subcutaneously (5)
in the rat potentiate the antinociceptive action of morphine, and also that these agonists have an independent effect on nociceptive responses recorded in the
thalamus (6). o n the other hand, dopamine antagonists
have not been shown to exert any influence on nociception in the rat, either by themselves or via the
opioid system ( 7 ) .
in contrast to this, kim & stoelting (8) demonstrated that intrathecally administered  xxxd1945xxx  prolonged the duration of analgesia from intrathecally
administered morphine in the rat, as measured with
the hot plate test (hpt) and the hind limb pinch test.
haloperidol and other butyrophenones bind to

opioid receptor sites (9, 10).  xxxd1945xxx  has not been
tested for this kind of binding so far, but those drugs
tested show a very low affinity for the receptor, implying no significant binding following therapeutic
doses in man.
despite the conflicting data on these animal studies,
controlled clinical studies on the possible potentiation
of morphine-induced analgesia by  xxxd1945xxx  after epidural or intrathecal administration are needed to confirm results of the open studies (1, 2). before such
a study can be performed, there is a need for an
experimental investigation into the nociceptive effect
of spinally administered  xxxd1945xxx  as well as on its
possible neurotoxicological effects.
our first aim in this study was to examine the effect
of  xxxd1945xxx  on intrathecal morphine analgesia in a
rat model in order to evaluate this drug interaction.
our second aim was to investigate, by means of a new
method combining microscopy and morphometry, the
histopathological effects on rat spinal cord produced
by chronic intrathecal administration of morphine and
 xxxd1945xxx  before clinical studies. the study was approved by the ethics committee of uppsala university.

material and methods
surgical procedure
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 300-320 g were used. induction

tion, which per 100 ml contained 4.25 g chloral hydrate, 12 g ethanol
(75%), 42.8 g  xxxd3034xxx , 0.97 g phenobarbital and 2.1 g
 xxxd2534xxx . an indwelling catheter, pe 10, stretched to half
its original length, was then inserted 8.5 cm through the atlantooccipital membrane, leaving the tip of the catheter at the ll-l2 level
( 1 1).
the position of the catheter was checked by the injection of 10 p1
of lidocaine (50 mg/ml, astra ab, sodertalje, sweden) followed
by 10 pl of saline. only those rats which showed a prompt paresis of
the hind limbs were accepted. after the operation the rats recovered
for 7 days.

drugs
drug solutions used were “morphine epidural” (aco, stockholm,
sweden), with no preservative or other additives, and  xxxd1945xxx 
solution with no preservative (courtesy of janssen pharmaceutica).
the observer was blind to the solutions used in all but two pilot tests
on antinociceptive response. irrespective of the doses used, each of
the two drugs was given intrathecally in a volume of 5 pl of saline
separated by 1 pi of air. in the single drug tests the drug was given
in a volume of 10 pl of saline. the catheter in all cases was flushed
with 15 pl of saline. doses are given individually for each nociceptive
test.
in the histopathological study the animals were divided into three
groups. one group was given 15 pl of saline intrathecally ( n = 6 ) ,
one group was given 5 pg of morphine and 5 pg of  xxxd1945xxx 
intrathecally (n = 5 ) , and one group was given 5 pg of morphine and
15 pg ofdroperidol intrathecally (n = 5) once a day for 14 consecutive
days. the morphine dose chosen was previously found to produce
a clear antinociceptive effect in the rat and, on a weight basis,
approximately corresponded to the dose given epidurally to humans.
the lower  xxxd1945xxx  dose approximately corresponded to what has
been given epidurally to humans in a clinical setting (2). the high
 xxxd1945xxx  dose was the highest dose tolerated with no severe sideeffects by the animal.

injection technique
two different modes of drug administration were considered. the
two drugs could be given by separate injections separated by a short
time interval (in order to give the animal time to adjust to the
increased intrathecal volume), or morphine and  xxxd1945xxx  could be
given at the same time as a single injection. in order to evaluate these
two methods, two pilot tests were performed.
the first method was abandoned, since, in the pilot test, a second
injection of saline 15 min after morphine was given inhibited the
antinociceptive response. thus, morphine, known to have a slow
onset when administered intrathecally, probably due to its hydrophilic properties, was obviously washed away or diluted by the second
injection.
when morphine and  xxxd1945xxx  were given in combination, they
were injected on the same occasion but from different syringes, the
solutions being separated in the catheter by 1 pi of air.
nociceptive lefts
o n 3 consecutive days prior to testing, the animals were adapted to
the test situation by placing them on the unheated test plate and in
the test cage for 20 min daily.
a dose-response curve was determined for  xxxd1945xxx  alone, for
morphine alone, for different doses of  xxxd1945xxx  with an added,
constant dose of morphine and for different doses of morphine with
an added, constant dose of  xxxd1945xxx .
the last-mentioned experiment was extended into a tolerance test.
twice a day for 5 consecutive days the rats were given the same doses
of morphine and  xxxd1945xxx  as they had been given on the first day.
at the time of the eleventh dose, they were again tested with the hot
plate test and the tail immersion test.

taif immersion test (tit). during testing the rat was kept in a small
test cage and 5 cm of its tail was immersed in water maintained at
52°c. time was measured from immersion until the tail was withdrawn, or, in the case of impaired motor function, until the animal
showed clear signs of pain (squeaking, distress).
the t i t was performed, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after
injection. a cut-off time of 20 s was set to avoid tissue damage.
hotplate test ( h p t ) . the rat was placed on a plate confined in a cage
with transparent walls and maintained at 52°c. time was measured
until the animal shook or licked its hind limbs, or, in the case of impaired motor function, until it made a clear effort to do so.
the h p t was performed 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after
injection. a cut-off time of 60 s was set to avoid tissue damage.
histological preparation
one day after the 14th and last injection, the animals were anesthetized with phenobarbital and transcardially perfused with 200 ml of
tyrcde’s solution (38”c, p h 7.4) containing 10 000 units of heparin
per liter, followed by a 500-ml mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde and
1% formaldehyde in 0. i mol/l phosphate buffer. the spinal cord was
removed and stored for 1 day in cold fixative (4°c). the l, segment
was cut out and serially sectioned by means of a vitratome (oxford
instruments) into 100-pm-thick transverse sections. after a short
rinse in a 0.1 mol/l sodium cacodylate buffer (ph 7.4), the sections
were postfixed for 30 min in 2 % osmium tetroxide dissolved in the
buffer, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin
(agar 100) between teflon-sprayed slides and 100-pm-thick acetate
foil (12). after being examined in the light microscope, small, randomly selected tissue blocks containing the dorsal or ventral horn
were excised and re-embedded for both fine and ultrafine sectioning
(13). the fine sections were stained with toluidine blue and the
ultrafine ones with uranyl and lead citrate.
the fine sections were prepared for estimation of cell count in a
reference volume (vj containing the substantia gelatinosa and lamina 111 of the l, segment (14-16).
the (v,d was calculated according to the cavalieri principle ( 17)
in the following way: the outline of the laminae 1-111 was drawn
with the aid of a drawing tube attached to the microscope. the mean
area of about ten samples from each animal was considered the base
of a cylinder, the height of which was the length of the l, segment,
which was calculated from its proportion of the total length of the
spinal cord (unpublished observations).
the number of cells (q, was calculated within the reference volume according to the disector principle by counting the number of
nucleoli present in a disector (18). the first time this method was
used in a neurotoxicological study was by svensson et al. ( 15). the
volume of a disector (vdi,)is easily computed: the area of the disector
times the height of the fine section (2 pm). a systematic random
sample of sections from each animal was analyzed. the total number
of cells (n) was calculated according to the following formula (16):

n

=

vrd
zq-(l),where
vdis

qis the actual number of cells counted, v,, is the reference volume,
i.e. the total volume of the lateral part of the dorsal horn of the l,
segment, v,,, is the volume of one disector, n is the total number of
cells within the reference volume. n is then recomputed into number
of cells per mm3.
the total cell volume was estimated by point-counting as the ratio
between the area of cell bodies and the area of a disector (cell ratio)
(19). the mean cell volume was calculated from total cell volume
and total cell number within the vwp
randomly selected sections of the ultrafine sections were selected
for electron microscopy. they were scanned for signs of cell toxicity:

microtubules, neurofilaments, synaptic vesicles, and spinal tracts.
statistical methods
wilcoxon's rank sum test was used to test for significant differences
(p<0.05) in the antinociceptive tests.
for the morphometric test, the coefficient of error (ce) - measuring
thedistribution ofindividual cell countsfor each disector-was estimated
by dividing individual cell counts into two groups ofsamples (for details,
see 16). a coefficient of error less than 0.05 was accepted.

results
antinociceptive responses
 xxxd1945xxx . a pilot study with intrathecal doses of  xxxd1945xxx  ranging between 0.01 pg and 25 pg revealed
that the highest dose caused an obvious impairment of
motor function after 120 min and 180 min. the animals became rigid and showed some tremor. therefore
this dose was omitted from the main study. the main
study showed no antinociceptive effect of  xxxd1945xxx 
in doses ranging from 0.1 pg to 10.0 pg, as measured
with h p t and tit. with the highest dose the animals
showed a slight rigidity at 120 rnin and 180 min,
which, however, did not prevent them from licking
their hind limbs or withdrawing their tail.

morphine. in the t i t a dose range of 0.1 pg to 3.0 pg
was used. the maximum effect was recorded at 30 rnin
and had returned to baseline level at 180 rnin for all
doses (fig. 1).
in the hpt a dose range of 1.0 pg to 30 pg was
used. the maximum effect was recorded at 60 rnin
and did not return to the baseline level at 180 rnin for
the highest doses (fig. 2).
in both cases the effects were dose dependent. many

animals showed an increased tremor as compared to
control rats.

morphine and  xxxd1945xxx . morphine was given in doses
ranging from 1.0 pg to 10.0 pg for the h p t and in
the range 0.1 pg to 3.0 pg for the tit. each dose was
given to six rats together with 1.0 pg of  xxxd1945xxx .
there was no significant difference in antinociception
between the groups which had been given morphine
and  xxxd1945xxx  and the groups which had been given
morphine only, either with the h p t or with the tit
(fig. 1 and 2).
the motor effects noted in the morphine-treated rats
were clearly enhanced in the group which also received
 xxxd1945xxx . these animals had obvious tremor and
clung spastically to the hand when handled. still their
motor response did not seem to be slowed down and
they did not seem to show any impairment of their
ability to lick their hind paws or remove their tail from
the hot bath.
in a second series,  xxxd1945xxx  was given in doses
ranging from 0.1 pg to 10 pg. each separate dose was
given to six rats, together with 5.0 pg of morphine,
and tested with hpt and tit. i n this series a cut-off
time of 30 s was used for the hpt. there was no
difference in antinociception for any of the combinations of morphine and  xxxd1945xxx  as compared to
morphine alone, either with the hpt or with the tit.
the motor effects already observed in the previous
experiment were very evident for the group receiving
10 pg of  xxxd1945xxx  together with morphine. during
the later part of the test period the animals showed
clear signs of pain but were so rigid as to be unable
to lick or shake their hind limbs.

histopathology
light microscopy findings. in light microscopy the neurones analyzed in the dorsal (fig. 3) and ventral (fig.
4) horns of the l, segment had the same appearance
in the morphine/ xxxd1945xxx -treated rats as was seen in
the animals given saline. a few scattered dark cells
were observed in both groups of animals, with no
significant differences in numbers. such cells were
interpreted as inflammatory (fig. 3). the spinal tracts
demonstrated no signs of spongiose appearance. in
some of the rats the catheter had created a slight impression on the spinal cord.

tact cell membranes, normally shaped nucleoli and
cell organelles (fig. 5). the boutons contained a majority of small and round vesicles. the dark cells seen
in the light microscopy were identified as microglial
cells (fig. 6 ) . adjacent to these cells no degenerated
or phagocytosed structures were observed. the vessels
and paravascular astrocytes demonstrated normal
morphology. overall, the tissue was generally wellpreserved.
quantitative findings
very small differences in the number of cells were
found between the three treatment groups (table 1).
a cell count of 90 000 mm-'i was found in all three
groups with a standard deviation of approximately
13 000 mm-3. the coefficient of error was below 0.05
in all three groups.

could be detected between  xxxd1945xxx /morphine and

additive effect or potentiation of  xxxd1945xxx  on morphine-induced analgesia could be shown.
thus the apparent effect of intrathecal  xxxd1945xxx  on
morphine analgesia demonstrated by kim & stoelting
(8), who used no less than 25 pg of  xxxd1945xxx , is
certainly ascribed to a cerebral effect of  xxxd1945xxx 
rather than potentiation of morphine effects on the
spinal level. this conclusion is further supported by
the fact that in their tests the effect was evident only
at 150 to 210 min after administration of the drugs.
the side-effects noted in this study for  xxxd1945xxx 
alone were motor impairment rather than sedation.
the doses selected were found to have no side-effects
in the early part of the period, and only the largest
dose (10 pg) had late side-effects. these effects, having
a slow onset of action, are probably ascribed to a
rostra1 distribution of  xxxd1945xxx .  xxxd1945xxx  also enhanced, possibly potentiated, the motor effects caused
by morphine. these effects were not quantified, however.
different modes of drug administration were considered. one could either give the two drugs with
separate injections separated by a short time interval
(in order to give the animal time to accommodate to

the increased intrathecal volume), or one could give
morphine and  xxxd1945xxx  at the same time as a single
injection.
the first method was abandoned since, in a pilot
test, a second injection of saline, given 15 min after
morphine, inhibited the antonociceptive response.
thus, morphine, known to have a slow onset when
administered intrathecally, probably due to its hydrophilic properties, was obviously washed away or diluted by the second injection.
mixing the two drugs prior to injection was, at the
time of this study, not considered a safe practice due
to possible p h incompatibility or unforeseen reactions
between the drugs. after the conclusion of this study,
however, it has become known to us that a solution
containing  xxxd1945xxx  and morphine is stable for 24 h
at 37°c and for 8 days at 4°c (20).
the selected mode of administration (the two drugs
given on the same occasion but from different syringes,
the solutions being separated in the catheter by 1 pl of
air) is not quite ideal. we cannot be certain that the
two drugs mix properly at the time of injection within
the confinement of the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spinal cord. the first drug entering the subarach-

noid space will probably spread more rostrally and
caudally than the second drug. thus, considering the
antinociceptive effect of the combination of the two
drugs, we have to take into account that the two drugs
may act on partially different sections of the spinal
cord, at least until diffusion sets in.
furthermore,  xxxd1945xxx  and morphine, having different lipophilic properties, may have different onset
and duration of action. therefore, we also have to
take into account a temporal discrepancy between the
drugs as well as the above-mentioned spatial distribution incongruity.

the pain inflicted on the animal in the tail immersion test is very mild and the response is considered to
reflect spinal activity, although on a higher level of
neuronal organization than the tail flick latency test.
an animal with intact motor function withdraws its
tail without showing any signs of distress, often without
even stopping its current activity of, for example, licking its paws. thus, for the animals which were unable
to move their tails properly because of motor impairment, a general reaction to pain is a later pain reaction
than a clear-cut withdrawal response, clearly giving a
false reading. still this reading was used because it
must be closer to the true value than running the test
until cut-off time. this would also cause unnecessary
distress to the animal.
the hot plate test reflects pain reactions not only
on a spinal level but also on a cerebral level, as the
reaction to pain includes licking and shaking of limbs.
a few of the animals passed urine when put on the
hot plate, probably due to a stress reaction. the urine
was immediately wiped off the plate, and although this
procedure must have disturbed the animal, causing a
somewhat unreliable time reading, it was preferred to
allowing the animal to put its hind limb into a pool
of hot urine, which would cause an immediate, sharp
pain and therefore a meaningless reading.
the lack of analgesic effect of spinal  xxxd1945xxx  is
in accordance with findings on other dopamine d,antagonists administered intraperitoneally in the rat
(7). there is, however, now a growing body of evidence that dopamine and endorphines interact on different levels of function as well as in different anatomical areas within the central nervous system (21).
opioid receptors are located on dopaminergic nerve
terminals and cell bodies in certain areas of the brain.
it has also been found that parenteral administration
of opioids results in an increased synthesis and metabolism of dopamine in nerve terminals. furthermore,
dopamine has been shown to influence the central pendorphine concentration (21).
apomorphine and other dopamine d,-agonists have
been shown to potentiate morphine analgesia after
intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration, as
measured by several different pain tests (5, 22). clat-
