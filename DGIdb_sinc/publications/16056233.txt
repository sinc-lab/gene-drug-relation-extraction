1 the skeletal muscle ca2 þ release channel, the ryanodine receptor, is activated by the trypanocidal
drug  xxxd3266xxx  via the calmodulin-binding site. as calmodulin activates and inhibits the ryanodine
receptor depending on whether ca2 þ is absent or present,  xxxd3266xxx  analogues were screened for
inhibition of the ryanodine receptor.
2 up to 300 mm, the novel  xxxd3266xxx  analogue, 4,40 -(carbonyl-bis(imino-4,1-phenylene-(2,5-benzimidazolylene)carbonylimino))-bis-benzenesulfonic acid disodium salt (nf676) was not able to
significantly inhibit the basal [3h]ryanodine binding. however, kinetic analysis of the high affinity
[3h]ryanodine binding elucidates a time-dependent increment of inhibition by nf676, which is
indicative for an open channel blocker.
3 moreover, the ryanodine receptor was much more sensitive towards inhibition by nf676 when
preactivated with caffeine or the nonhydrolysable atp analogue, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate.
nonetheless, the  xxxd3266xxx  activated ryanodine receptor was not susceptible towards high-affinity
nf676 inhibition, indicating an allosteric hindrance between the binding sites of  xxxd3266xxx  and nf676.
4 in the line of this finding, nf676 per se was not capable to elute the purified ryanodine receptor
from a calmodulin-sepharose, but it prevented the elution by  xxxd3266xxx .
5 other than  xxxd3266xxx , nf676 did not inhibit the ca2 þ atpase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
however,  xxxd3266xxx -induced ca2 þ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum was completely abrogated by
preincubation with nf676.
6 taken together, we conclude from these data that nf676 represents a novel lead compound as a
potent use-dependent blocker of the  xxxg2001xxx  via an allosteric interaction
with the  xxxd3266xxx -binding site.

introduction
skeletal muscle contraction is under the strict control of
the cytoplasmatic ca2 þ concentration. excitation of skeletal
muscle results in the rapid ca2 þ release from sarcoplasmic
reticulum through the ryanodine receptor/ca2 þ release channel type 1 ( xxxg2001xxx ). the ryanodine receptor is one of the largest
ion channels known, organized as a homotetramer consisting
of four identical subunits each of a mass of 560 kda (for a
review, see meissner, 1994; sutko & airey, 1996; franziniarmstrong & protasi, 1997). there are several endogenous
regulators of the ryanodine receptor. out of these, calmodulin
exerts a dualistic influence on the  xxxg2001xxx  depending on the free
ca2 þ concentration (tripathy et al., 1995; rodney et al.,
2000). in its ca2 þ -free form, calmodulin (apocalmodulin)
activates the  xxxg2001xxx , but ca2 þ -liganded calmodulin is an

inhibitor of the channel (plank et al., 1988; smith et al., 1989;
buratti et al., 1995; tripathy et al., 1995).
the typanozidal drug  xxxd3266xxx  is established in the therapy
of infections caused by onchcerca volvulus, trypanosoma
gambiense and trypanosoma rhodensiense. however, in mammalians, several targets of action have been characterized
(voogd et al., 1993; freissmuth et al., 1996). among these, the
 xxxg2001xxx  was identified to be activated by  xxxd3266xxx  (emmick
et al., 1994; hohenegger et al., 1996; sitsapesan & williams,
1996). we could previously show that  xxxd3266xxx  is capable to
discriminate between various calmodulin-binding sites in
proteins as divergent as the  xxxg2001xxx , the g protein bg-subunit,
the neuronal no synthase and the  xxxd2213xxx  s-transferase
fusion protein with the cooh-terminal calmodulin-binding
domain of the metabotropic  xxxg981xxx  7a (klinger
et al., 2001). these observations made it conceivable that
 xxxd3266xxx  may serve as a lead compound for calmodulin

 xxxd3266xxx  analogue, 8,80 -(piperazine-1,4-diyl-bis(carbonylimino4,1-phenylenecarbonyl-imino-4,1-phenylene)
carbonyl-imino))-bis-naphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid hexasodium salt
(nf 307) exert their action via the calmodulin-binding site,
which was mapped to the peptide corresponding to amino acid
3609–3643 (klinger et al., 1999; papineni et al., 2002).  xxxd3266xxx 
is also a potent activator of the cardiac ryanodine receptor
type ii (ryr2) in [3h]ryanodine binding and single channel
recordings (hohenegger et al., 1996; sitsapesan & williams,
1996). moreover, very recent work of the laboratory of
sitsapesan provides experimental evidence that in the ryr2
 xxxd3266xxx  may also bind to the calmodulin-binding site of the
ion channel (hill et al., 2004).
as calmodulin is capable to activate and inhibit the  xxxg2001xxx 
(buratti et al., 1995; tripathy et al., 1995; fruen et al., 2000),
we have searched for novel compounds related to  xxxd3266xxx 
but with inhibitory action at the  xxxg2001xxx . the novel  xxxd3266xxx 
analogue nf676 (4,40 -(carbonyl-bis (imino-4,1-phenylene-(2,5benzimidazolylene) carbonylimino))-bis-benzenesulfonic acid
disodium salt) is characterised and shown to act as an usedependent antagonist of the  xxxg2001xxx  which may highlight a
novel drug target binding site.

methods
synthesis of the  xxxd3266xxx  analogue nf676
nf676 was synthesized similar to methods recently published
(kassack et al., 2004). briefly, 80 mmol of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (sulfanilic acid), dissolved in 150 ml water ph 4.5,
were acylated with 3,4-dinitrobenzoylchloride (140 mmol,
dissolved in 100 ml toluene). the aqueous layer was evaporated in vacuum to dryness yielding a yellow powder
(compound 1, yield: 69.2%). in total, 25 mmol of compound
1 was dissolved in 500 ml methanol and hydrogenated using
pto2 as catalyst (4 bar, 10 h). subsequently, 26 mmol
4-nitrobenzaldehyde (dissolved in 120 ml methanol) were
added immediately and stirred for 24 h. after concentrating
the mixture to a volume of b200 ml, the product was oxidized
(o2: 6 bar, 1201c, 12 h). recrystallization from ethanol/water
yielded 44% of 4-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)benzimidazole-5-carboxamido) benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt (compound 2). in all,
16 mmol of compound 2 was resuspended in a mixture of
350 ml methanol and 150 ml water and hydrogenated using
pd/c as catalyst (4 bar, 10 h) to yield 98% of compound 3
(4-(2-(4-aminophenyl)benzimidazole-5-carboxamido) benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt). lastly, 9 mmol of compound 3 were
resuspended in a mixture of 120 ml water and 40 ml methanol
(ph 7) and treated with 240 mmol phosgene (20% solution in
toluene). the complete mixture was evaporated in vacuum to
dryness, and the raw product was recrystallized from
methanol/water to yield 60% of nf676. identity of nf676
was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(1h- and 13c-nmr) and electron spray mass spectrometry.
purity of nf676 was demonstrated by elemental analysis (c,
h, n) and by a high-performance liquid chromatography
method previously published (kassack & nickel, 1996).
elemental analysis data were within 70.4%, and hplc
purity was 495%.

preparation of heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (hsr)
and purified  xxxg2001xxx 
hsr membranes were prepared from rabbit hind leg and back
skeletal muscle or heart as described previously (hohenegger
& suko, 1993; klinger et al., 1999). skeletal muscle hsr was
used as a starting material to purify the  xxxg2001xxx  (klinger et al.,
1999). the protein concentration was determined with the
biorad coomassie-blue kit (biorad, munich, germany) or
the bicinchoninic acid assay (micro-bca; pierce, rockford,
il, u.s.a.).

[3h]ryanodine binding
briefly, the hsr membranes (75 mg) were incubated in 50 ml
containing 40 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 200 mm kcl, 10 mm
nacl, 20 nm [3h]ryanodine, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin,
100 mm pefablock and the drug concentrations indicated in the
figure legends. the free calcium concentration was adjusted by
the ratio of egta and cacl2. the incubation was carried out
for 45 min at 371c. under such conditions, the difference
between stimulated and inhibited binding is more pronounced.
for kinetic experiments, the incubation time was varied from 2
to 180 min and saturation isotherms were incubated between
90 and 120 min. nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 100 mm ryanodine. the reaction was terminated by
filtration over glass fiber filters (presoaked in 1% polyethylenimine) using a skatron vacuum filtration device. the filters
were rinsed with 10 ml ice-cold 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4) and
500 mm nacl and the remaining radioactivity on the filters
was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

affinity chromatography and gel electrophoresis
the purified ryanodine receptor (0.1–0.2 mg ml1) was diluted
in 100 ml binding buffer containing 20 mm hepes.naoh (ph
7.4), 200 mm kcl, 10 mm nacl, 1 mm egta, 1.2 mm cacl2,
0.68% chaps and 0.5% phosphatidylcholine and preequilibrated with calmodulin-sepharose (60 ml of a 50% slurry).
after an incubation period of 60 min at 41c, the suspension
was centrifuged for 5 min at 500  g. the supernatant was
removed. the sedimented calmodulin-sepharose was washed
three times and subsequently, the ryanodine receptor was
eluted batchwise in three steps with 100 ml binding buffer
supplemented with  xxxd3266xxx , calmodulin or nf676. the
supernatants of the washes and elutions were mixed with
laemmli sample buffer. similarly, after the last elution step,
the calmodulin-sepharose was boiled in laemmli sample
buffer and centrifuged in order to control for the remaining
 xxxg2001xxx  on the gel matrix. the samples were heated to 951c for
5 min and aliquots were applied onto a discontinuous sds–
polyacrylamide gels (5% stacking and 7% separating gel). the
resolved proteins were visualized by silver staining and the
intensity of the protein bands quantified by the quanti-scan
software (biosofts, cambridge, u.k.).

calcium uptake and calcium release measurements
the photometric ca2 þ flux measurements were carried out
with hsr (1 mg ml1) in a medium containing 40 mm
mops.tris (ph 7.4), 140 mm kcl, 250 mm mgcl2, 50 mg ml1
creatine kinase, 4 mm creatine phosphate and 30 mm arsenazo

i. wolner et al

iii. the measurements were carried out with a sigma zws ii
dual-wavelength photometer. the reactions were continuously
monitored under permanent stirring at room temperature.
changes in the ca2 þ concentration were monitored by
subtracting the changes in transmission of arsenazo iii at
690 nm from that at 650 nm. the difference in transmission
was set zero and thereafter cacl2 was added stepwise (usually
to a final concentration of 60 mm) in order to obtain an
estimate for the change in free ca2 þ concentration. the ca2 þ
uptake into hsr was initiated by the addition of 150 mm atp.
the ca2 þ release was triggered by injection of the  xxxg2001xxx 
agonist  xxxd3266xxx  directly into the cuvette through a lid using a
hamilton syringe. at the end of each experiment, the virtually
ca2 þ free condition is defined by the addition of 2 mm egta.

miscellaneous procedures
the experiments were carried out in duplicates and each
experiment was repeated at least two times with different
protein preparations (n ¼ 6). all data are presented as
mean7s.d., if not otherwise stated. the data were fitted by
nonlinear least-squares regression to the appropriate equations
describing exponential decay, exponential rise and the hill
equation. statistical significance (po0.05) was determined
with student’s t-test and for multiple comparison with
anova and post hoc scheffe’s test.

results
[3h]ryanodine binding in presence of the  xxxd3266xxx 
analogue nf676
under physiological conditions (ph 7.4),  xxxd3266xxx  is an anionic
symmetric molecule in which a urea bridge connects two
polysulfonated naphthylbenzamide ring systems. the novel
 xxxd3266xxx  analogue nf676 shows modifications in the structure

and physicochemical properties compared to  xxxd3266xxx 
(figure 1). the symmetry is retained in the structure of
nf676. however, modifications involve a replacement of the
naphthalenetrisulfonic acid by a benzenesulfonic acid residue,
a substitution of the 1,3 (meta) connected aromatic residues by
1,4 (para) connection, an exchange of 4-methylbenzamide by
benzimidazole, and thus a switch from an anionic compound
( xxxd3266xxx ) to the zwitterionic nf676.
there is a general consensus that acceleration of the rate of
high affinity [3h]ryanodine binding is a measure for ryr
activation proportional to channel opening (chu et al., 1990).
the novel  xxxd3266xxx  analogue nf676 is not capable to inhibit
the high-affinity [3h]ryanodine binding at concentrations up to
100 mm irrespective of the usage of hsr from cardiac or
skeletal muscle (figure 2a). nevertheless, close to 1 mm nf676
reduces the binding to approximately 50–60%. in a rough
estimate, the high-affinity [3h]ryanodine binding with skeletal
muscle hsr was inhibited with an ic50 of 850741 mm. from
the relative comparison of the inhibitory potency of nf676,
the skeletal muscle hsr seems to be more sensitive than the
cardiac hsr. for this reason the following experiments
characterizing the action of nf676 were carried out with
hsr from skeletal muscle.
it is possible that nf676 achieves its inhibitory nature
by direct competition with the radioligand. nevertheless, in
saturation experiments, nf676 exerts no influence on the highaffinity [3h]ryanodine-binding site (data not shown). the
calculated kd for the high-affinity ryanodine binding was not
significantly different, independent whether nf676 was absent
or present (control: 4.971.1 nm; 100 mm nf676: 4.272.4 nm;
n ¼ 6). however, at concentrations of above 20 nm ryanodine,
the binding was slightly reduced in the presence of nf676.
the kinetic analysis showed that the apparent association
rate of [3h]ryanodine in the early time points is not affected
by nf676 when five experiments were pooled (figure 2b).
however, after an incubation time above 30 min, nf676
reduced the binding of [3h]ryanodine, which became

significant for the late time point (figure 2b; asterisk:
p ¼ 0.015). the calculated apparent association rate for
[3h]ryanodine was 0.005370.0006 nm1 min1 (n ¼ 3) under
control condition, which is lower, but comparable to
previously obtained results under similar conditions (klinger
et al., 1999). in the presence of nf676, the apparent
association rate was calculated to be 0.01370.002 nm1 min1
(n ¼ 3) (figure 2b). in order to exclude that drug-facilitated
heat denaturation is responsible for the reduction of [3h]ryanodine binding by nf676, one would expect that a simple
dilution of nf676 in the assay mixture is sufficient to recover
[3h]ryanodine binding. we, therefore, incubated hsr vesicles
in the absence and presence of 100 mm nf676, under
conditions identical to figure 2b. compared to the control,
the [3h]ryanodine binding was reduced by nf676 to
54.35715.86% (n ¼ 6) after an incubation for 5 h. thereafter,
aliquots of the incubation were diluted 10-fold, keeping all
compounds at a constant concentration, except nf676. within
an additional hour of incubation, a significant recovery of the
[3h]ryanodine binding was obtained to 76.9474.38% (n ¼ 9;
p ¼ 0.0012) of the control. this observation allows for the
conjecture that nf676 leads to a reversible inhibition of the
ryanodine receptor.
in order to determine dissociation rates, [3h]ryanodine
was allowed to bind to hsr vesicles for 2 h and thereafter
the dissociation was initiated by a 1000-fold molar excess of
cold ryanodine. the dissociation rate was accelerated in the
presence of nf676 to 0.274770.09 min1 (n ¼ 3) compared to
0.047970.003 min1 (n ¼ 3) under control conditions
(figure 2c). together, the experimentally determined kinetic
parameters allow for the assumption that nf676 inhibits the
bmax of the high-affinity [3h]ryanodine binding by the
acceleration of the dissociation of the radioligand (figure 2b
and c).

pharmacological analysis of the [3h]ryanodine binding
in the presence of nf676

figure 2 inhibition of the  xxxg2001xxx  by nf676. (a) sarcoplasmic
reticulum membranes (75 mg) were incubated with 20 nm [3h]ryanodine for 45 min at 371c in presence of nf676 at a calculated free
ca2 þ concentration of 1.2 mm. (b) kinetic analysis of the [3h]ryanodine binding in the absence and presence of 100 mm nf676 of five
experiments. asterisk represents statistical significance versus control (*p ¼ 0.015; students t-test). (c) [3h]ryanodine (20 nm) was
allowed to associate to hsr membranes. after 120 min of
incubation (time ¼ 0), the dissociation of [3h]ryanodine was
triggered by the addition of 20 mm ryanodine in the absence or
presence of 100 mm nf676. for comparison, the association was
also allowed to proceed (control). the data represent mean7s.d.
of a triplicate experiment, which was repeated twice with similar
results.

the  xxxg2001xxx  is tightly regulated by the cytoplasmic ca2 þ
concentration (meissner, 1994). this is documented by a
ca2 þ dependence of the [3h]ryanodine binding which follows
a bell-shaped curve (figure 3). in the presence of 100 mm
nf676, the [3h]ryanodine binding is superimposable with the
control at micromolar and millimolar concentrations of free
ca2 þ . the ec50 values for ca2 þ activated [3h]ryanodine
binding was 4.970.36 mm (n ¼ 4) in the absence and
4.8570.07 mm (n ¼ 4) in the presence of 100 mm nf676. the
ca2 þ -dependent inhibition of [3h]ryanodine binding gave an
ic50 value of 0.9670.08 mm (n ¼ 4) under control conditions
and 0.9470.29 mm (n ¼ 4) in the presence of nf676. this
observation is divergent to previous observations with  xxxd3266xxx 
and the more potent  xxxd3266xxx  analogue nf307, which act in a
ca2 þ -dependent manner (klinger et al., 1999; papineni et al.,
2002).  xxxd3266xxx  and nf307 increase the affinity of the  xxxg2001xxx 
for ca2 þ (klinger et al., 1999). in contrast to nf676,
ruthenium red completely inhibited the [3h]ryanodine binding
independent of the free ca2 þ concentration (figure 3).

activation-dependent inhibition of the  xxxg2001xxx  by nf676
so far nf676 shows rather low inhibitory potency under basal
conditions of [3h]ryanodine binding. however, the inhibition

competitive manner. if this is true, one would expect that in
the presence of nf676, the affinity for  xxxd3266xxx  is shifted to the
right. surprisingly, such a shift was not detectable in the
concentration–response curve of  xxxd3266xxx  (figure 5a and b).
moreover, the amplitude of the  xxxd3266xxx  induced stimulation
of [3h]ryanodine binding is diminished progressively by
increasing concentrations of nf676, which may indicate that
nf676 precludes further action of  xxxd3266xxx  (figure 5a).
conversely, the potency of nf676 was not significantly altered
by the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  (figure 5b). these observations are
compatible with a noncompetitive behavior between  xxxd3266xxx 
and nf676. most likely, nf676 interacts allosterically with
the  xxxd3266xxx  binding.

interaction of nf676 with the  xxxd3266xxx -binding site

figure 3 ca2 þ -dependent [3h]ryanodine binding in presence of
nf676. sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes (75 mg) were incubated
with 20 nm [3h]ryanodine under conditions described in legend to
figure 2a. the free ca2 þ concentrations were adjusted by variation
of the concentration of egta and cacl2. the incubation buffer
containing only 1 mm egta but no supplemented cacl2 was set
to be 1 nm free ca2 þ . incubations were carried out in the absence
and presence of 100 mm nf676 or 20 mm ruthenium red. the data
represent mean7s.e.m. of a triplicate experiment, which was
repeated three times.

became significantly pronounced at longer incubation times
(figure 2b). activating micromolar ca2 þ concentrations were
not sufficient to enhance inhibition of the basal [3h]ryanodine
binding. therefore, the  xxxg2001xxx  was stimulated with 10 mm
caffeine which increased the [3h]ryanodine binding, and also
the potency of nf676 to inhibit the  xxxg2001xxx  (figure 4a and b).
the concentration–response curve is dramatically shifted to
the left as this is clearly seen for the normalized data
(figure 4b). the calculated ic50 for nf676 in the absence of
caffeine was approximately 850 mm (cf. figure 2a) and is
reduced to 3.670.96 mm (n ¼ 3) in the presence of 10 mm
caffeine (figure 4b). these data are in accordance with the
assumption that nf676 got full access to its binding site only
in the activated conformation of the  xxxg2001xxx . therefore,
facilitation of the open conformation by the  xxxg2001xxx  agonist
caffeine had a pronounced effect on the potency of nf676.
similar results were obtained with the nonhydrolysable atp
analogues,  xxxd2933xxx  (b, g-methyleneadenosine 50 -triphosphate) or  xxxd604xxx . the nucleotide  xxxd604xxx  was used at a
concentration of 0.5 mm, which stimulated the ryanodine
binding approximately half maximally. nevertheless, this
activation of the  xxxg2001xxx  was sufficient to facilitate the
inhibition by nf676 (figure 4c and d). the normalized
concentration–response curve shifted to the left (figure 4d)
which was reflected by ic50 values of 809744 mm in the
absence of  xxxd604xxx  and 107.4753.4 mm (n ¼ 3) in the
presence of  xxxd604xxx . similar results were obtained with
 xxxd2933xxx  (data not shown). compared to controls, the shift
in the ic50 of nf676 was highly significant in the presence
of caffeine (po0.003) or  xxxd604xxx  (po0.005; anova and
post hoc scheffe’s test). thus, nf676 can be considered as an
use-dependent inhibitor of the  xxxg2001xxx .
 xxxd3266xxx , which is known to activate the  xxxg2001xxx , may
possibly interact with the inhibitory nf676-binding site in a

in order to confirm an allosteric hindrance between  xxxd3266xxx 
and nf676, the purified  xxxg2001xxx  was immobilized on a
calmodulin-sepharose matrix and eluted by calmodulin interacting agents. the eluted  xxxg2001xxx  was visualised by silver
staining, which represents a semiquantitative experimental
approach. in accordance to our earlier observations, calmodulin and  xxxd3266xxx  were capable to elute the immobilized  xxxg2001xxx 
from the calmodulin-sepharose in the presence of 200 mm
ca2 þ (figure 6a and b). nf676 at a concentration of 1 mm
was not capable to disrupt the binding of the  xxxg2001xxx  to
calmodulin, thus nearly all of the  xxxg2001xxx  was trapped on the
sepharose matrix (figure 6c). moreover, the successive elution
steps significantly reduced the intensity of the corresponding
 xxxg2001xxx  band compared with the wash step. furthermore, the
 xxxd3266xxx -induced dissociation of the  xxxg2001xxx –calmodulin complex was abrogated by nf676. consequently, no  xxxg2001xxx  was
found in the supernatant of the elution steps (figure 6d). thus,
the accessibility of the calmodulin-binding site by  xxxd3266xxx  is
antagonized by nf676, although nf676 per se had no
influence on the interaction of the  xxxg2001xxx  with calmodulin.
however, it is possible that nf676 may develop calmodulin
interacting properties only at the activated  xxxg2001xxx  (cf. figure 2).
to test this possibility, the purified  xxxg2001xxx  was also exposed to
10 mm caffeine or 0.5 mm  xxxd604xxx  in the presence of 1 mm
nf676. in all cases, the  xxxg2001xxx  was not eluted from the
calmodulin-sepharose independent whether caffeine or  xxxd604xxx  were used alone or in combination with nf676 (data not
shown). therefore, a conformation-dependent interaction of
nf676 with the calmodulin-binding site is unlikely.

ca2 þ uptake and ca2 þ release measurements
taken together, the above-described results provide substantial evidence that nf676 inhibits the  xxxg2001xxx  in the activated
conformation with high affinity via a binding site related to
that of  xxxd3266xxx . in order to confirm this interpretation and
expand it by functional analysis, we have employed photometric ca2 þ measurements with arsenazo iii in order to
circumvent the fluorescent behavior of  xxxd3266xxx  and nf676.
this experimental approach allows for the simultaneous
observation of ca2 þ uptake and ca2 þ release in hsr vesicles
(wyskovsky et al., 1990).  xxxd3266xxx  has been shown to release
ca2 þ from passively loaded sr vesicles (emmick et al., 1994).
this holds true also for actively loaded hsr in the presence of
an atp regenerating system (figure 7a). however, it is evident
that after  xxxd3266xxx  addition ca2 þ reuptake is dramatically

reduced. this is compatible with the finding that  xxxd3266xxx  is
also a potent inhibitor of the ca2 þ atpase of the sarcoplasmic
reticulum (emmick et al., 1994). therefore, 100 mm nf676 was
added prior to 150 mm atp in order to detect a possible
inhibition of the ca2 þ atpase. as depicted from figure 7b,
the addition of 100 mm nf676 caused an increase in transmission which is not due to dilution of the suspension (1.5%).
nevertheless, upon administration of 150 mm atp, the ca2 þ
uptake rate was not altered, the traces were superimposable to
controls and the steady-state plateau was reached (cf. also
figure 7c). as a rough estimate, the initial pseudo-linear ca2 þ
uptake phase was calculated to be 47.0717.3 a.u. min1 (n ¼ 3)
in the absence of nf676 and 33.2713.7 a.u. min1 (n ¼ 4;
p ¼ 0.48) in the presence of 100 mm nf676. spontaneous ca2 þ
releases or the occurrence of spontaneous ca2 þ oscillations
was not observed in the presence of nf676. a simple addition
of 100 mm nf676 at the plateau phase of the ca2 þ uptake
curve had no effect on the  xxxd3266xxx -induced ca2 þ release
(figure 7d). at the plateau phase of the ca2 þ uptake curve,
the  xxxg2001xxx  is virtually closed and nf676 may have no excess to
its binding site. therefore, the peak amplitude of the suramininduced ca2 þ release (150 mm) was 2.9770.06 a.u. in the
absence of nf676 and 2.7770.35 a.u. in the presence of
100 mm nf676 (n ¼ 3; p ¼ 0.38). in contrast, addition of
100 mm nf676 prior to the atp application resulted in a

complete abrogation of the  xxxd3266xxx -induced ca2 þ release
(figure 7c). analogously, caffeine-induced ca2 þ release was
also inhibited by nf676 (data not shown). we therefore
conclude that nf676 is a novel and potent  xxxg2001xxx  antagonist.

discussion
we have previously shown that  xxxd3266xxx  and its analogue
nf307 are potent agonists of the  xxxg2001xxx  via the calmodulinbinding site (hohenegger et al., 1996; klinger et al., 1999;
2001; suko et al., 2001). here, we show that modifications in
the structure of  xxxd3266xxx  convert the molecule into a potent
 xxxg2001xxx  antagonist. this  xxxd3266xxx  analogue, nf676, has only
weak effects on the basal ryanodine binding to hsr from
cardiac or skeletal muscle (figure 2a). conversely, under
conditions of  xxxg2001xxx  activation, nf676 turns into a potent
antagonist. the conclusion that nf676 is a use-dependent
inhibitor of the  xxxg2001xxx  is based on two observations. first,
nf676 inhibited [3h]ryanodine binding which becomes
significantly pronounced with increasing incubation times
(figure 2b). second, the potency of nf676 to inhibit
[3h]ryanodine binding was significantly increased when the
 xxxg2001xxx  was activated by  xxxd604xxx  or caffeine (figure 4). in
both cases, it is assumed that cumulative channel openings

increase with time. therefore, a possibly hidden or protected
binding site for nf676 may become accessible. we have
previously demonstrated that  xxxd3266xxx  does not interact with
the adenine nucleotide-binding site of the  xxxg2001xxx  (hohenegger
et al., 1996). the same is true for nf676. over the complete
range, the concentration–response curve for nf676 is significantly shifted to the left in the presence of  xxxd604xxx 
(figure 4d). this is not compatible with a competitive
interaction via the adenine nucleotide-binding site of the
 xxxg2001xxx .
our data suggest that nf676 may interact allosterically with
the  xxxd3266xxx -binding site of the  xxxg2001xxx . the  xxxd3266xxx  activated
 xxxg2001xxx  was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations
of nf676, but the ic50 values were not significantly changed
compared to control (figure 5a and b). vice versa, in the
presence of nf676, the concentration–response curves for
 xxxd3266xxx  were not shifted to the right. such a noncompetitive
behavior is corroborated by the following findings: (i)  xxxd3266xxx 
is capable to elute the  xxxg2001xxx  from a calmodulin-sepharose
while nf676 is not (figure 6b and c). the calmodulin-binding
site is therefore not accessible for nf676 such that the  xxxg2001xxx 
is not displaced from the calmodulin-sepharose. (ii) in the
presence of nf676, the elution of the  xxxg2001xxx  by  xxxd3266xxx  is
abrogated (figure 6d). thus, based on these results, the

60 min at 41c. the affinity matrix was washed three times and
subsequently,  xxxg2001xxx  was eluted with buffer containing 10 mm
calmodulin (a), 100 mm  xxxd3266xxx  (b), 1 mm nf676 (c) or 100 mm
 xxxd3266xxx  plus 1mm nf676 (d). residual protein trapped in the
matrix is labelled ‘m’. aliquots of input (lanes labelled ‘in’), of last
wash step (lanes labelled ‘w’) and of the three implemented elution
steps (lanes labelled ‘e1–e3’), were applied onto sds–polyacrylamide gels. the proteins were visualized by silver staining and
the high molecular mass range is depicted of the  xxxg2001xxx  indicated
by ‘ryr’. the intensity of the  xxxg2001xxx  band was quantified by the
quanti scans software.

conclusion is drawn that nf676 interferes with the suraminbinding site via an allosteric interaction, but has no access to
the calmodulin-binding site. this mechanism is very efficient,
since  xxxd3266xxx -induced ca2 þ release is completely blocked
by preincubation with nf676 (figure 7c). moreover, the
mechanism of nf676-induced inhibition of the [3h]ryanodine
binding is reversible. dilution of nf676 in the binding buffer
from 100 to 10 mm recovers [3h]ryanodine binding significantly
from 54 to 77% of control.
thus, these results substantially expand our previous
knowledge on  xxxd3266xxx  and  xxxd3266xxx  analogues. importantly,
 xxxd3266xxx  and the related agonist nf307 bind to the calmodulin-binding site of the  xxxg2001xxx  but mimic only the stimulatory
effect of calmodulin (klinger et al., 1999; papineni et al., 2002).
apocalmodulin acts as an activator, whereas ca2 þ bound to
the cooh-terminal end of calmodulin switches the protein to
an inhibitor (plank et al., 1988; smith et al., 1989; buratti
et al., 1995; tripathy et al., 1995; rodney et al., 2001). the
calmodulin-binding site was mapped to a peptide stretched
from  xxxg2001xxx  amino acids 3609–3643 (moore et al., 1999;
rodney et al., 2000; 2001). apocalmodulin and ca2 þ -bound
calmodulin bind to this binding site with their cooh-terminal
loop; however, apocalmodulin additionally requires the amino
acids between 3634 and 3643 (xiong et al., 2002). these
findings are in agreement with the structural alignments

figure 7 effect of nf676 on ca2 þ uptake and ca2 þ release with
hsr vesicles. (a–d) ca2 þ uptake and ca2 þ release were continuously monitored with a dual-wavelength photometer using 30 mm
arsenazo iii as a ca2 þ -sensitive dye. ca2 þ uptake and suramininduced ca2 þ release (a, c and d) were investigated in the absence (a)
and presence of nf676 (b, c and d). the ca2 þ transients depict
representative experiments (n ¼ 3–7).

investigating calmodulin binding to the  xxxg2001xxx  in the absence
and presence of ca2 þ (samso & wagenknecht, 2002). the
three-dimensional reconstructions of the two conformations of
the calmodulin– xxxg2001xxx  complex show distinct but overlapping
binding sites for calmodulin. the novel antagonist nf676
interacts with the  xxxg2001xxx  in a calcium-independent mechanism.
interestingly, ca2 þ -dependent activation and inhibition of the
[3h] ryanodine binding of the  xxxg2001xxx  was not altered by nf676
at any free ca2 þ concentration (figure 3). this is surprising,
because  xxxd3266xxx  and nf307 have been found to increase the
sensitivity of the  xxxg2001xxx  for ca2 þ and by doing so this
mechanism essentially contributes to the stimulatory effect of
 xxxd3266xxx  and nf307. when the  xxxg2001xxx  is activated by caffeine,
 xxxd604xxx  or  xxxd3266xxx , nf676 is a potent inhibitor of the
 xxxg2001xxx  (figures 4 and 5). we are not able to explain this

inhibition of  xxxg2001xxx 

behavior at the moment, but possibly the conformation of the
ca2 þ -activated  xxxg2001xxx  may not give full access to the nf676binding site (cf. also figure 7d). therefore, a simple opening or
activation of the  xxxg2001xxx  by ca2 þ is not sufficient to enable
nf676-mediated inhibition.
the calmodulin-binding site of the  xxxg2001xxx  is conserved in the
cardiac isoform (ryr2) with a homology of more than 90%.
moreover, mutation or deletion of the putative cardiac
calmodulin-binding site abrogated calmodulin binding and
inhibition by calmodulin in single channel recordings (yamaguchi et al., 2003). nevertheless, the ryr2 is not activated by
calmodulin at submicromolar ca2 þ concentrations. this
functional diversity of the ryr isoforms has not been clarified
on the molecular level.
recent observations highlight the essential pathophysiological role of the ryr2 in heart failure and arrhythmia (scoote
& williams, 2002; wehrens & marks, 2003). owing to
sympathetic stimulation of the heart, the ryr2 is hyperphosphorylated which results in augmented channel opening and
ca2 þ depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum. consequently, the
myocardial contractility is reduced and clinical features like
heart failure are observed. mutations in the ryr2 have been
linked to heart failure and exercise-induced sudden cardiac
death. it is worth mentioning that a use-dependent inhibitor of
the ryr2 would represent a rational new therapeutic concept
for the treatment of these common diseases of the heart.
 xxxd3266xxx  is capable to activate  xxxg2001xxx  and the ryr2
(hohenegger et al., 1996; sitsapesan & williams, 1996).
however,  xxxd3266xxx  has the drawback that it inhibits efficiently
the ca2 þ atpase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the atpbinding site (figure 7a) (emmick et al., 1994). this is clearly
not the case for nf676 (figure 7b). although, not investigated
in great detail, the basal [3h]ryanodine binding was also
inhibited by nf676 in cardiac hsr and thereby indicates the
ryr2 as a drug target (figure 2a). moreover, nf676 at
physiological ph shows zwitterionic behaviour, which may
facilitate bioavailability. the  xxxd3266xxx  analogue nf676 represents, therefore, an important novel lead compound in the
search for a novel class of use-dependent inhibitors of the
ryr.
