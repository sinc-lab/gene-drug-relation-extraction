background. of the polymethylene bismethonium congeners (c5±c12 and c18),  xxxd1820xxx  (c10) is the most potent neuromuscular blocking agent. we tested the hypothesis
that these congeners act as straight molecules and will not bend easily in spite of the ¯exible
connecting chain between the methonium heads. for congeners higher than c10, we also
hypothesized that the relative dif®culty with which the molecules to bend to conform to the
interonium distance of c10 proportionately reduces their neuromuscular blocking potency.
methods. each congener was modelled and subjected to computer searches for representative low-energy molecular conformers. the conformation±potency relationship of the congeners was examined.
results. for all congeners, we found that the lowest energy conformer (the `global minimum')
has a straight-chain conformation. reduction of the interonium distance (by bending) incurs a
steep energy penalty linearly related to the distance reduced. the global minimum of c10 has
an interonium distance of 14.03 aê and a total molecular length of 20.10 aê. for other congeners, the interonium distance differential from that of c10 and the energy penalty required to
conform to the interonium distance of c10 (where applicable) correlate with the reported
logarithmic (mmol kg±1) dose requirement for neuromuscular block.
conclusions. the c10 congeners strongly prefer a straight conformation. their molecular
length and resistance to bending is key to their neuromuscular blocking potency. a molecular
length of approximately 20 aê should best ®t the space available to neuromuscular blocking
agents between the two receptive sites of the endplate acetylcholine receptor.

of the polymethylene bismethonium series of compounds,
c5±c12 and c18, congener c10 ( xxxd1820xxx ) has an
optimal neuromuscular blocking action1 and was once
brought to clinical use as neuromuscular blocking drug for
anaesthetized humans undergoing surgery.2 3 other congeners, longer and shorter alike, are less potent. instead of
having neuromuscular blocking properties, c5 and c6 are
potent ganglion blockers.1
in the literature, the molecules of these congeners are
generally presented in straight-chain conformation. each
congener differs from its neighbour only by one methylene
group in the polymethylene chain that connects the two
terminal methonium heads. besides molecular length and a
slight increment in lipophilicity with each additional

methylene group, no known chemical factors may plausibly
explain the neuromuscular blocking pro®le of the series of
congeners. consequentially, one can assume that at one
point congener c10 optimally ®ts into an available space
between the two receptive sites of the skeletal muscle
endplate acetylcholine receptor.4±7 furthermore, one can
also hypothesize that the relative dif®culty with which other
congeners to ®t into this inter-site space may explain their
relative lack of neuromuscular blocking potency. however,
because the polymethylene chain connecting the terminal
methonium heads is ¯exible, the molecule of each congener
might adopt a shorter (bent) conformation with relative
ease. if this were true, the molecular length of these
congeners would become less meaningful and the superior

neuromuscular blocking potency of c10 would no longer be
explainable.
to test the hypothesis that the polymethylene bismethonium congeners probably exist as straight-chain molecules,
we searched for their low-energy conformations and
computed the energy penalty that hinders them from
reducing their interonium distance. the basic assumption
is that low-energy conformers are stable and preferentially
populated.8 only low-energy conformers, especially the
global minimum, may represent the molecule in
conformation±activity relationship studies.
to test the hypothesis that the molecular length of these
congeners determines their neuromuscular blocking potency, we also investigated the relationships between the
neuromuscular blocking dose requirement, the interonium
distance and the energy penalty required to change the
interonium distance of these congeners. in this series of
congeners, the interonium distance parallels the molecular
length because they all have the same methonium head.
these relationships are of interest not only in medicinal
chemistry but also for the assessment of the distance
between the two receptive sites of the endplate acetylcholine receptor in vivo. although the morphology of the
 xxxg456xxx  of the electric organ has
been studied very extensively in vitro,4±7 few studies have
given an indication of the inter-receptive site distance of the
endplate acetylcholine receptor in vivo. because of their
simple molecular structure, the conformation of the c10
congeners depends on few forces other than the torsion of
the methylene bonds and the hindrance and mutual repulsion of the two charged methonium heads. this increases
the chance that their molecular conformation can be
determined accurately. once their conformation is determined, one can exploit their well-established pharmacological pro®le for theoretical explorations of their
conformation±activity relationship.9 an abbreviated account of the conformation of c9, c10 and c11 has been
presented10 and preliminary results of the present report
have been cited in a recent review.9

methods
the study was performed on an sgi r10000 workstation
using the sybyl (version 6.7) molecular modelling software
package (tripos, st louis, mo, usa). molecules of c5 to
c18 were ®rst constructed in a straight-chain conformation.
their total energy was minimized. each molecule was then
subjected to extensive searches for a collection of representative low-energy conformers, by a method of conformational searching using a genetic algorithm (ga
search; for description, see appendix).11 for each congener,
we programmed the computer to identify up to 70 lowenergy conformers and store them in a database. in a
subsequent operation, all conformers in the entire database
were energy-minimized thoroughly, to converge at
ê ±1 using the mmff94s force ®eld,12 and
0.05 kcal mol±1 a

conformers considered duplicates of others were deleted.
the mmff94s takes into consideration the following
components of total energy: bond stretch, angle bending,
torsional, stretch-bending interaction, out of plane bending,
1±4 van der waals, van der waals, 1±4 electrostatic, and
electrostatic.
the interonium distance of each conformer was measured
from the centre of one n atom to the other (n±n distance).
the van der waals extensions of the terminal h atoms were
computed. these extensions de®ne the outer boundaries of
the h atoms and were included in the determination of the
total molecular length. for each congener, the relationship
between the n±n distance and the energy of the conformers
was examined by linear regression. the linear regression
also yielded the slope of energy penalty required to change
the n±n distance and the total energy penalty required to
conform to certain n±n distances. when it became certain
that the lowest energy conformer of each congener had a
straight-chain conformation, these global minima of the
entire series were identi®ed and all further analyses,
including examination of the relationship between
molecular length and neuromuscular blocking dose requirement, were based on these straight-chain conformers, as
follows.
the neuromuscular blocking dose requirements of
c5±c12 and c18 were established by the work of paton
and zaimis.1 for the present study, we adopted, without
bias, their ed95 (dose requirement to block neuromuscular
transmission by 95%) values for the tibialis anterior muscle
of the cat in vivo. the ed95 values were converted from
mg kg±1 to mmol kg±1 and expressed as log(ed95
mmol kg±1) where appropriate.
as bonds do not stretch under ordinary conditions, the
energy penalty determined by linear extrapolation for
ê
shorter molecules (c5±c9) to conform to n±n = 14.03 a
(the n±n distance of c10) has uncertain meaning. for some
studies, we therefore separated the congeners into two
categories, namely `c10 and higher' and `c10 and lower',
and recognized that in each category the effect of molecular
length on the neuromuscular blocking potency, if any, may
need a different explanation. accordingly, linear regressions were performed only on c10±c12 and c18, whose
neuromuscular blocking ed95 values in log(mmol kg±1)
were regressed on their n±n distance differentials from
ê , and again on the total energy penalty required to
14.03 a
accommodate the difference differentials. the values were
also ranked. for c6±c10, the ed95 values in log(mmol kg±1)
and the n±n distance differentials were examined by
ranking. as c5 and c6 were inferior neuromuscular
blockers1 and their ed95 values were available only as
>40 mg kg±1, c5 was excluded from the ranking.

inspection of the geometry of the conformers in each
database showed that bending of one methylene bond was
the least conformational change observed and that the
torsion of the terminal methylene bond was more energycostly to twist than other methylene bonds. the differences
in energy between the two lowest-energy conformers of all
congeners (c5±c18) are also shown in table 1, as minimum

congeners, and was 2.07 kcal mol±1 in the case of c10.

conformers of c10. the lowest-energy conformer (global minimum) is
ê . it is
the straight-chain conformer with an n±n distance of 14.03 a
clearly separated from the rest. of the two conformers of next shortest
n±n distances, the high-energy outlier (h) results from rotation of one
bond closest to the methonium head. the other (l), from rotation of one
non-terminal bond, represents minimum changes in n±n distance and
energy (2.07 kcal mol±1).

this clear separation was observed in all congeners
(c5±c18). among congeners, the minimum de is another
indicator of the relative dif®culty with which the congeners
change conformation, and again shows that the shorter the
congener, the harder it is to bend.
the conformation±activity relationship concerning the
neuromuscular blocking potency of the congeners is
presented in table 2 and figure 3, using the lowest-energy
straight-chain conformer as representative of each congener
and the neuromuscular blocking ed95 values adopted from
paton and zaimis1. the energy penalty for c10±c12 and

c18 to conform to an n±n distance of 14.03 a
by multiplying the energy penalty slope by the distance
ê . in both the c10 and higher and
differential from 14.03 a
the c10 and lower category, the ed95 values, the energy

penalty and the n±n distance differentials from 14.03 a
showed identical rank order with no exceptions. figure 3
shows the relationship between the ed95 (mmol kg±1)
values of the c10 and higher congeners and the energy

penalties required to conform to the n±n distance of 14.03 a
(fig. 3, upper left) and the relationship between the ed95
(mmol kg±1) values and the n±n distance differentials from
ê (fig. 3, upper right). upon logarithmic transform14.03 a
ation of the dose requirements, the relationships become
linear (fig. 3, lower left and lower right).

discussion
the genetic algorithm validated for the search for lowenergy molecular conformations (ga search) is a practical
version of the general optimization theory11 (see appendix).

the mmff94s force ®eld used in this study to minimize the
total energy of each conformer is a version of a reliable
force ®eld for small molecules and proteins.12 as the
number of possible conformers of a molecule increases
geometrically with the number of rotatable bonds, it is
theoretically impracticable to ascertain the discovery of the
least-energy conformer of molecules with many rotatable
bonds. hence, a ga search is particularly useful for our
purpose, because, unlike the random search, for which
computer time increases geometrically with the number of
bonds, the ga search uses an algorithm for which the
computer time required increases arithmetically.11
brie¯y, the ga search is a `global minimizer' that
optimizes the population by improving the average ®tness of
its individuals. it effectively searches the entire conformational space of a molecule for a collection of ®t samples,
without detailed re®nement of each sample during the
search. to re®ne the samples, a ga conformational search
is generally followed by an energy minimization that fully
minimizes the individual conformers harvested previously.
an energy minimizer improves the inter-atom relationship
of a conformer and joggles among all components of energy
to reduce the total to a minimum. while allowing
components of energy to increase (if needed towards that
goal), an energy minimizer must reduce the total energy
iteration after iteration. it may not allow the total energy to
increase at any step, even if such an intermediate step may
lead to a better ®nal outcome, because allowing both the
total energy and its components to increase will make the
entire process open-ended and endless. an energy minimizer is therefore a `local minimizer', bound to what is
possible within the limit of its starting geometry. the two
minimizers are thereby mutually complementary and interdependent processes. combined, they ®rst ef®ciently sample a wide conformational space and then reliably re®ne the
samples. for the present study, we used the combination of
steps not only to ®nd the global minima for correlation with
neuromuscular blocking potency among congeners but also
to collect local minima for linear regression of the energy
penalty required to bend each congener.
the observation that the global minimum of every
congener (c5±c18) has the straight-chain geometry is not
unexpected.8 nor is the observation that the higher
congeners have gentler slopes of energy penalty to bend,
because long connecting chains increase conformational
¯exibility and reduce mutual repulsion between the
methonium heads. also readily understandable is the
®nding that among the methylene bonds in the connecting
chain the terminal methylene bond is the hardest to twist,
because rotation of this bond directly involves the bulk and
the charge of the methonium head. rather, it is the large
energy barrier in favour of the straight conformation and the
close relationship between the conformational features and
the neuromuscular blocking dose requirement of the
congeners that are interesting. before computer modelling
became available, stereomodels (such as the model of

dreiding13) have permitted crude measurement of the
dimensions of molecules and tactile estimation of their
¯exibility. however, these models are at best semiquantitative and they give only a snapshot of a local minimum.
they cannot search conformational space, minimize total
energy, compute electrostatic or other components of
energy, or quantify the slope of changes. they are hard to
assemble in the case of large rigid cubic structures. since the
conclusion of the present project, we have extended our
studies to neuromuscular blocking agents of greater structural complexity, and have likewise obtained useful preliminary information to extend their structure±activity
relationship to the conformation±activity relationship.10 it
should be noted that, as a rule, the geometry of muscle
relaxant molecules is grossly inaccurate until computed
thoroughly.
like all alkanes, the methylene bonds of these congeners
have lower torsional energy when their neighbouring bonds
are staggered anti and the molecule is straight.8 for
example, when the con®guration of butane is changed
from anti to gauche, by a twist of one bond, the four-carbon
chain bends and shortens and the energy of the molecule
increases by about 0.9 kcal mol±1.8 for another comparison,
we replaced the n atoms of c10 with c atoms and subjected
the hypothetical compound to the same study. this hypothetical compound, 2,2,13,13-tetramethyl tetradecane, or
(ch3)3c(ch2)10c(ch3)3, also has a straight-chain conformer as its global minimum. it has no charged atoms. the
distance between its carbon 2 and carbon 13, the equivalent
ê
of the n±n distance of c10, can decrease from 13 to 11 a
without linearly increasing the energy penalty. by contrast,
it will take 5±7 kcal mol±1 for c10 to do so. the minimum
energy penalty to twist one bond is 0.84 kcal mol±1 for the
hypothetical compound vs 2.07 kcal mol±1 for c10 (table 1,
c10). viewed from these perspectives, our results indicate
the large extent to which the c10 congeners resist bending.
as molecules stabilize at low energy, a difference in
energy of 1.4 kcal mol±1 would mean a 10-to-1 ratio for the
lower-energy conformer to be populated preferentially.6 in
the example of butane, an energy barrier of 0.9 kcal mol±1

means a 72-to-28 chance in favour of the straight
conformer.8 by the same principle, our ®nding of a large
energy penalty required to bend would indicate the large
extent to which the straight conformers of the c10
congeners would prevail. in the case of c5, the minimum
de of 4.32 kcal mol±1 indicates that c5 will only vibrate
around its global minimum, with little chance of assuming a
bent conformation.
our data on the conformation±activity relationship support the hypothesis that the molecular length determines the
neuromuscular blocking dose requirement of the c10
congeners. the lipophilicity of the molecule is a factor in
the neuromuscular blocking potency of a series of
aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents.14 however,
increments in lipophilicity are unlikely to be large enough to
play a signi®cant role in the neuromuscular blocking
potency of the c10 congeners; otherwise, the neuromuscular blocking potency of the congeners would not show a
biphasic distribution to peak at c10. in agreement with this
hypothesis, the slope of conformational energy penalty
changed in tandem with the decrease in neuromuscular
blocking potency. both showed reduced inter-congener
decrement towards the higher end of the series.
from the above, it appears that c10 is a credible
molecular yardstick to measure, in vivo, the inner intersite space of the muscle endplate acetylcholine receptor
available to neuromuscular blocking agents at one point of
the drug±receptor interaction. one can also argue that the
long congeners act by conforming to the receptive sites by
bending, and that the shorter congeners have different
mechanisms of action. however, some caveats, which
follow, must ®rst be observed. these caveats should not
qualitatively nullify our conclusions.
first, all conformational searches can be criticized for not
taking into consideration the effects of the milieu in which
the molecules actually exist and act. for example, polar
solvents such as water tend to orient their molecules in a
coordinated manner so as to reduce the effect of the electric
charges on the conformation of the dissolved molecules.
furthermore, electrolytes and the acid±base status of the

biological ¯uid will further complicate the issue. modelling
the congeners in the presence of solvent may alter the results
in quantitative terms. however, we are not aware of any
validation of the `solvation' method or of the application of
other advanced molecular modelling techniques to the study
of quaternary neuromuscular blocking drugs. meanwhile,
conformational search and minimization appear encouraging as an affordable step in the right direction to extend
traditional structure±activity studies to the conformation±activity relationship.
another caveat concerns the thoroughness of the
conformational search. inadequate searches will produce
samples of greater scatter in energy and will miss the best
possible product. increased scatter will increase the slope if
the point of lowest energy alone has no scatter, which is the
case with the global minima here. furthermore, congeners
with a greater number of rotatable bonds have a greater
chance of being searched inadequately. if this happens, the
inter-congener relationship will be skewed. to minimize
technical errors, we used large populations, many generations and much computer time. we also adjusted these

parameters according to the chain length, based on repeated
preliminary test runs (see appendix). as a result, our data in
table 1 show consistency, high goodness of linear ®t, and
smooth and logical transition between congeners, in agreement with basic thermodynamic predictions. the simple
molecular structure of the congeners has rendered their
global minima relatively easy to ®nd and the search results
consistent.
geometry at the level of the receptive sites is important in
determining how the muscle relaxant molecule may ®t the
receptor. experiments in vitro have shown a distance of
ê between the inner borders of the receptive sites

molecular yardstick, our data would suggest that the space

measuring the receptor macromolecule.5 7 15 it is possible
that our argument may apply only to the cat tibialis anterior
muscle preparation in vivo, as used by paton and zaimis.1
higher and lower congeners require different explanations of why they are both weaker neuromuscular blockers
than c10. higher congeners may act by bringing their
methonium heads to ®t the available inter-site space of the
receptor. the loss of potency will depend on the energy
penalty, which is proportional to the distance of the required
accommodation and the slope. as molecules do not stretch,
lower congeners will not span both receptive sites. instead,
they may use two molecules acting simultaneously, one at
each site, as does succinylcholine, with a loss of potency.16
if the receptor changes its local conformation during the
interaction to ®t the congeners, the energy penalty will
likewise depend on the distance that has to be accommodated. if figure 3 were extrapolated to include the lower
congeners, as if they were stretchable, linearity of correlation would still exist (personal observation). in any case,
molecular length and how strongly the congeners prefer a
straight conformation determine their neuromuscular blocking potency.

appendix
a ga search for molecular conformations, in general terms,
starts with the creation of an initial population of
conformers by randomly changing the torsion angles of
designated rotatable bonds of the molecule to be searched.
each conformer is considered an `individual' with `genes'
contained in a `chromosome'. in this instance, each gene
represents the torsion angle of a rotatable bond. the
population of conformers then evolves, generation after
generation, towards a population of higher and higher
`®tness' by `selection', `crossover breeding', `mutation' and
`elitism'. in this case, ®tness of the individuals means low
energy of the conformers. selection means that individuals
of high ®tness are added preferentially to the next generation to participate in further evolution. selection is done by
a `roulette wheel pseudorandom' method in which individuals of greater ®tness are assigned a larger arc in the wheel,
which means a greater chance of being selected `randomly'
into the `mating pool'. crossover breeding means crossing
of conformers to exchange bonds. elitism means that the
best conformer of each generation is guaranteed a place in
the next generation and is protected from mutation.
mutation means random twisting of bonds. each product
of crossover breeding and/or mutation is subjected to
partial re®nement by abbreviated energy minimization. all
conformers (newly created and pre-existing) are then
compared and, keeping the population size constant, un®t
conformers are left out while ®t conformers enter the next
generation. generation after generation, the entire population then becomes a collection of conformers of lower and
lower average energy. as a result, a ga search ef®ciently
samples all available conformational space and produces a

representative collection of ®t conformers for further
re®nement. re®nement means thorough minimization of
energy. for large molecules, each search and minimization
run of the database may take hours, depending on the
computer and the programs.
according to the general algorithm, we speci®ed the
following parameters for the present study. all methylene
(±cc±) bonds were designated as rotatable. the size of the
population equalled 100 individuals for each rotatable bond.
for example, c10 has nine rotatable bonds and therefore
900 individuals in the evolving population. likewise, c15
has 14 bonds and a population of 1400 individuals. the
number of generations each population evolved through was
set to 10 times the number of individuals in the population.
thus, c10 evolved through 9000 generations and c18
through 17 000 generations. at the end of each search, up to
70 ®t conformers were saved, as long as each had energy
within 5 kcal mol±1 per rotatable bond of the ®ttest. for the
linear regression, we aimed at producing 30±50 evenly
distributed discrete conformers for each congener, all within
a range of 10 kcal mol±1 fully minimized. a large energy
allowance during the search prevented premature elimination of ®t conformers before ®nal minimization.
preliminary experiments had shown that these parameters
would allow a thorough search and yield satisfactory results
for all congeners, c5±c18 alike.
we used the mmff94s force ®eld12 in the minimization
of the conformers in the database, allowing an unlimited
number of iterations for each conformer to converge at a
ê ±1 gradient between iterations. all
0.05 kcal mol±1 a
minimized conformers in the database were also compared,
by matching each conformer with all other conformers atom
for atom. any conformer matching with a root mean square
ê or less from any other
inter-atom distance of 0.1 a
conformer was considered a duplicate and was deleted.
