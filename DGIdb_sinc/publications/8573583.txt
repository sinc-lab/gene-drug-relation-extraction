abstract: the active metabolite of  xxxd2450xxx , a771726, is a novel immunosuppressive compound
that has been shown to be a powerful antiproliferative agent for mononuclear and t-cells. the molecular
mechanism of action for this compound has not been clearly established. in vitro cellular and enzymatic
assays, however, demonstrate that  xxxd2450xxx  is an inhibitor of several protein tyrosine kinases, with
ic50 values between 30 and 100 Âµm. the in vivo properties of a771726 are reminiscent of another
immunosuppressive agent,  xxxd363xxx  sodium, which has been shown to be a nanomolar inhibitor (ki )
10-30 nm) of the enzyme  xxxg633xxx  (dhodase). on this basis, we have investigated
the effects of  xxxd2450xxx  and a771726 on the activity of purified recombinant human dhodase. we
find that a771726 is a potent inhibitor of dhodase (ki ) 179 ( 19 nm), while the parent compound,
 xxxd2450xxx , had no inhibitory effect at concentrations as high as 1 Âµm. studies of the dependence of
inhibition on the concentrations of the substrates ubiquinone and dihydroorotate demonstrate that a771726
is a competitive inhibitor of the ubiquinone binding site and is noncompetitive with respect to
dihydroorotate. the potency of a771726 as a dhodase inhibitor is thus 100-1000-fold greater than
that reported for its inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases. these data suggest that an alternative explanation
for the immunosuppressive efficacy of a771726 may be the potent inhibition of dhodase by this
compound.

organ transplantation has become an important modern
treatment for patients with advanced organ damage. in the
united states alone over 100 000 people have received
kidney transplants, with patient survival rates of ca. 8085% after 5 years. this life-sustaining therapy has been
successful in large part because of the availability of
immunosuppressive drugs that attenuate immune response
in the patient, thus overcoming the normal immune-based
rejection that would otherwise occur. the two immunosuppressive drugs most commonly used in organ transplantation,
 xxxd1781xxx  and fk506 (tacrolimus), share a similar
mechanism of action along with some common side effects
(thomson, 1990). there is considerable interest in identifying novel immunosuppressive compounds, with alternative
mechanisms of action, to potentially circumvent some of the
negative effects of current therapies. such immunosuppressive compounds could also be useful in the treatment of other
immune-based diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and
autoimmune diseases.
 xxxd2450xxx  (figure 1) is a novel immunosuppressive that
has demonstrated efficacy in human clinical trials for
rheumatoid arthritis (bartlett et al., 1991). the drug also
shows efficacy in animal models of arthritis and autoimmune
disease and is effective in blocking rejection after allograft
and xenograft transplantation in animals (bartlett et al., 1991;
williams et al., 1994; xiao et al., 1994). studies have
demonstrated that  xxxd2450xxx  is actually a prodrug that is
processed in vivo to the active metabolite a771726 (bartlett

et al., 1991). in cellular assays, a771726 has been shown
to inhibit proliferation of mononuclear and t-cells. the
immunosuppressive effects of this compound are likely to
be a direct result of its ability to block proliferation of
immune cells. the specific molecular mechanism of action
of a771726 as an immunosuppressive, however, has not yet
been elucidated.
several studies have been reported demonstrating that
a771726 is capable of inhibiting a number of protein tyrosine
kinases. the ic50 values for the compound in vitro range
from ca. 30 to 100 Âµm for the various kinases (bartlett et
al., 1991; mattar et al., 1993; xu et al., 1995). these data
have lead to the widely held view that protein  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibition is the molecular mechanism of a771726 immunosuppression in vivo. the data that have been reported to
date, however, are not sufficient to support this hypothesis
unequivocally. in fact, cherwinski et al. (1995) were not

able to demonstrate inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases by
 xxxd2450xxx  at concentrations that were antiproliferative in
t-cells, thus calling into question whether protein tyrosine
kinase inhibition is truly relevant to the antiproliferative
effects of this compound. these same investigators demonstrated also that the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd2450xxx 
could not be reversed by purine nucleosides, a result that
distinguished  xxxd2450xxx  from other immunosuppressive
agents, such as  xxxd2678xxx  (cherwinski et al., 1995).
in contrast, nair et al. (1995) recently reported that the
antiproliferative effects of  xxxd2450xxx  can be relieved by
treatment with uridine in mouse smooth muscle cells. these
results imply that the mechanism of antiproliferation by
 xxxd2450xxx  involves inhibition of pyrimidine production or
use in these cells.
 xxxd363xxx  sodium (bqr) is another experimental immunosuppressive that also works by blocking immune cell
proliferation (jaffee et al., 1993; makowka et al., 1993). this
compound has been shown (chen et al., 1992) to function
as a nanomolar inhibitor of the enzyme dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (dhodase; l-5,6-dihydroorotate:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase;  xxxg633xxx ). by inhibiting this enzyme,
 xxxd363xxx  sodium blocks the rate-limiting step in de novo
pyrimidine biosynthesis. the associated depletion of cellular
stores of pyrimidine results in the antiproliferative effects
displayed by bqr in cellular assays. as with a771726,
 xxxd363xxx  sodium is effective in blocking organ rejection after
allograft and xenograft transplantation in animals and is
likewise effective in animal models of arthritis and autoimmune disease (makowka et al., 1993.)
because of the similarities in the in vivo and cellular
profiles of a771726 and  xxxd363xxx  sodium, we wondered if
the former compound might also function by inhibition of
dhodase. we have therefore tested the ability of  xxxd2450xxx  and a771726 to inhibit purified recombinant human
dhodase and report the results of these studies here. we
find that a771726 is a competititve inhibitor of the ubiquinone binding site of human dhodase, while the parent
compound,  xxxd2450xxx , had no effect on the enzyme. the
potency of a771726 as a dhodase inhibitor is much greater
than its corresponding potency as a protein  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor, suggesting that inhibition of dhodase may be an
alternative explanation for the immunosuppressive activity
of this compound.
materials and methods
materials. recombinant human dhodase was purified
as described previously (copeland et al., 1995).  xxxd2450xxx 
and a771726 were synthesized by the medicinal chemistry
department of dupont merck research laboratories. the
identities of the two compounds were confirmed by 1h-nmr,
ir, and mass spectroscopy. the purity of each compound
was assessed by reverse-phase hplc and elemental analysis
and was found to be > 95% for both compounds. dihydroorotate (dho), ubiquinone (coenzyme q6; ubiquinone30), 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (dcip), triton x-100,
gelatin, and  xxxd3449xxx  were purchased from sigma.
enzyme activity measurements. dhodase activity was
measured by the dcip colorimetric assay, as described by
copeland et al. (1995). this is a coupled assay in which
oxidation of dho and subsequent reduction of ubiquinone
are stoichiometrically equivalent to the reduction of dcip.

biochemistry, vol. 35, no. 4, 1996 1271
reduction of dcip is accompanied by a loss of absorbance
at 610 nm ( ) 21 500 m-1 cm-1). the assay was performed
in a 96-well microtiter plate at ambient temperature (ca. 25
Â°c). stock solutions of 10 mm  xxxd2450xxx  and a771726
were prepared in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and these were
diluted with reaction buffer (100 mm tris and 0.1 % triton
x-100, ph 8.0) to prepare working stocks of the inhibitors
at varying concentrations. for each reaction, the well
contained 10 nm dhodase, 68 Âµm dcip, 0.16 mg/ml
gelatin, the stated concentration of ubiquinone, 10 Âµl of an
inhibitor working stock to give the stated final concentration,
and reaction buffer. after a 5-min equilibration period, the
reaction was initiated by addition of dho to the stated final
concentrations. the total volume of reaction mixture for
each assay was 150 Âµl, and the final dmso concentration
was e 0.01% (v/v). the reaction progress was followed by
recording the loss of absorbance at 610 nm over a 10-min
period (during which the velocity remained linear). velocities are reported as the change in absorbance at 610 nm per
minute (in units of mod/min ) 1000âˆ†a/min), and each
reported value is the average of three replicates. in experiments where the dho or ubiquinone concentration was
varied, the other substrate was held constant at 200 Âµm. to
determine the inhibitor potency of  xxxd2450xxx  and a771726,
the effects of varying concentrations of the two compounds
on the initial velocity of the dhodase reaction was
measured over a concentration range of 0.01-1.0 Âµm. in
these experiments the dho and ubiquinone concentrations
were held constant at 200 and 100 Âµm, respectively.
results and discussion
when a771726 is added to a sample of recombinant
human dhodase, one observes a concentration-dependent
inhibition of enzyme activity with an apparent ic50 value of
0.3 Âµm.  xxxd2450xxx , in contrast, did not show any
concentration-dependent inhibition of dhodase over the
concentration range 0-1.0 Âµm (data not shown). these data
indicated that a771726 is indeed a potent inhibitor of human
dhodase. to determine the mode of inhibition of dhodase by a771726, we investigated the effects of substrate
concentration on the inhibitory potency of this compound.
dhodase requires two substrates for catalysis: dihydroorotate, which is converted to  xxxd2794xxx  by the enzyme,
and ubiquinone, which acts as an electron acceptor during
catalysis. we therefore varied the concentration of each of
these substrates independently while holding the other
substrate at a saturating concentration. the initial velocity
of the enzymatic reaction at these varying substrate concentrations was determined in the absence of inhibitor and at
three different concentrations of a771726: 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0
Âµm. the data from these experiments were well described
by the henri-michaelis-menten equation for each inhibitor
concentration (data not shown):

the patterns observed in panels a and b of figure 2 are the
classical signatures for noncompetitive and competitive
inhibition, respectively. from these results we conclude that
a771726 is a competitive inhibitor of dhodase with respect
to ubiquinone binding and noncompetitive with respect to
dho binding. knowing that the inhibitor is competitive for
ubiquinone binding, we can use the data from figure 2b to
determine the inhibitor constant, ki, for a771726 from the
negative value of the x-intercept of a plot of kmapp as a
function of inhibitor concentration (segel, 1975). figure 3
illustrates such a plot for the data obtained at varying
ubiquinone concentrations from figure 2b. the ki value
determined from this plot was 0.179 ( 0.019 Âµm.
the ki values for a771726 inhibition of protein tyrosine
kinases have not been reported, making it difficult to
correctly compare the relative potency of this compound for
dhodase and these enzymes. comparing the ki values
obtained here for dhodase with the reported ic50s for
a771726 inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases, we find that
this compound is some 100-1000-fold more potent as a
dhodase inhibitor. this comparison is not rigorously valid,
however, since the mode of protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition
has not been reported, and for some inhibitor types (e.g.,
competitive inhibitors) the substrate concentration can greatly

affect the ic50 value obtained (cheng & prusoff, 1973).
nevertheless, given the large disparity in these potencies, it
is likely that a771726 is a much better dhodase inhibitor
than it is a protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor.
while more potent, the dhodase inhibitor bqr demonstrates in vivo immunosuppressive efficacy and cellular
antiproliferation similar to a771726 (batt et al., 1995). both
bqr and a771726 block rejection after allograft and
xenograft transplantation in animals, both compounds are
effective in animal models of arthritis and autoimmune
disease, and both compounds inhibit proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the mixed lymphocyte
reaction assay. given these similarities in cellular and in
vivo effects, and the current demonstration that both compounds can potentially block de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis
by inhibition of dhodase, it seems reasonable to propose
that the mechanism of a771726 immunosuppression is based
on dhodase inhibition instead of, or in addition to, the
ability of this compound to inhibit protein tyrosine kinases.
the mechanism of dhodase inhibition differs between
bqr and a771726. bqr has been demonstrated to be a
noncompetitive inhibitor of both the dho and ubiquinone
binding sites of the enzyme, with a ki value of ca. 10-30
nm (chen et al., 1992; copeland et al., 1995) presumably,
 xxxd363xxx  sodium inhibits the enzyme by binding at a site
that is distinct from both the dho and ubiquinone binding
pockets. in contrast, a771726 is clearly competitive for the
ubiquinone binding site of this enzyme (see figure 2b).
competition for the ubiquinone binding site raises the
possibility of poor enzyme selectivity for this compound.
such a poor selectivity profile may lead to broad inhibition
of other ubiquinone-dependent enzymes. for example, a
general ubiquinone binding inhibitor would be likely to
interfere with oxidative phosphorylation by blocking mitochondrial respiration at several key points in the electron
transfer cascade. whether a771726 is a general inhibitor
of ubiquinone binding proteins or is specific for the
ubiquinone binding site of dhodase remains to be determined. studies to examine the effects of this compound on
mitochondrial electron transfer are currently underway.
in summary, we have demonstrated that a771726 is a
potent, competitive inhibitor of human dhodase. the
cellular and in vivo effects of this compound are all consistent
with inhibition of this critical enzyme of the pyrimidine
biosynthesis pathway. whether the in vivo immunosuppressive effects of a771726 are due to inhibition of dhodase,

dhodase inhibition by  xxxd2450xxx  metabolite
inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases, or the combined effects
of inhibiting both enzyme types remains to be established.
the present data, however, provide compelling evidence for
a potential role of dhodase inhibition in the mechanism
of action of this novel immunosuppressive agent.
