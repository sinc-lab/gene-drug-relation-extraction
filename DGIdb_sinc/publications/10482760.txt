1999. gabab-receptor–mediated inhibition was investigated in anatomically identified inhibitory interneurons located at the border between the
dentate gyrus granule cell layer and hilus. biocytin staining was used to
visualize the morphology of recorded cells. a molecular layer stimulus
evoked a pharmacologically isolated slow inhibitory postsynaptic current
(ipsc), recorded with whole cell patch-clamp techniques, in 55 of 63
interneurons. application of the  xxxg828xxx  antagonists, cgp
35348 (400 mm) or cgp 55845 (1 mm) to a subset of 25 interneurons
suppressed the slow ipsc by an amount ranging from 10 to 100%. in
56% of these cells, the slow ipsc was entirely gabab-receptor–mediated. however, in the remaining interneurons, a component of the slow
ipsc was resistant to gabab antagonists. subtraction of this antagonist
resistant current from the slow ipsc isolated the gabab component
(ipscb). this ipscb had a similar onset and peak latency to that
recorded from granule cells but a significantly shorter duration. the
gabab agonist, baclofen (10 mm), produced a cgp 55845-sensitive
outward current in 19 of 27 interneurons. in the eight cells that lacked a
baclofen current, strong or repetitive ml stimulation also failed to evoke
an ipscb, indicating that these cells lacked functional gabab receptoractivated potassium currents. in cells that expressed a baclofen current,
the amplitude of this current was ;50% smaller in interneurons with
axons that projected into the granule cell dendritic layer (22.2 6 5.3 pa;
mean 6 se) than in interneurons with axons that projected into or near
the granule cell body layer (46.1 6 10.0 pa). similarly, the ipscb
amplitude was smaller in interneurons projecting to dendritic (9.4 6 2.7
pa) than perisomatic regions (34.3 6 5.1 pa). these findings suggest
that gabab inhibition more strongly regulates interneurons with axons
that project into perisomatic than dendritic regions. to determine the
functional role of gabab inhibition, we examined the effect of ipspb on
action potential firing and synaptic excitation of these interneurons.
ipspb and ipspa both suppressed depolarization-induced neuronal firing. however, unlike ipspa, suppression of firing by ipspb could be
easily overcome with strong depolarization. ipspb markedly suppressed
n-methyl-d-aspartate but not ampa epsps, suggesting that gabab
inhibition may play a role in regulating slow synaptic excitation of these
interneurons. heterogeneous expression of gabab currents in hilar
border interneurons therefore may provide a mechanism for the differential regulation of excitation of these cells and thereby exert an important role in shaping neuronal activity in the dentate gyrus.

interneurons located in the molecular layer (ml), granule cell
layer (gcl), and hilus. one region particularly rich in glutamic
acid decarboxylase (gad) positive, presumably inhibitory,
interneurons is the border of the gcl and the hilus (houser
and esclapez 1994; kosaka et al. 1985; ribak and seress 1983;
seress and ribak 1983; sloviter and nilaver 1987), an area
referred to by amaral (1978) as the dentate hilus border of
zone 4 or the d/h border zone. interneurons located in this
area form synaptic contacts with specific regions of the granule
cells they innervate (amaral 1978; halasy and somogyi 1993;
han et al. 1993; lorente de no 1934; mott et al. 1997; ramon
y cajal 1968; soriano and frotscher 1993). some cells in this
area, such as the pyramidal basket cells, have axons that
arborize within or very close to the granule cell layer. in
contrast, other interneurons are specialized to innervate more
distal dendritic regions of granule cells. interneurons innervating somatic and dendritic regions of granule cells may have
different inhibitory effects (miles et al. 1996). although many
interneurons in this layer innervate granule cells, recent studies
also have identified a subgroup of interneurons that are specialized to contact only other inhibitory cells (gulyás et al.
1996, hájos et al. 1996). these connected interneuronal networks may play a role in rhythm generation in the hippocampal
formation. differential modulation of d/h border zone interneurons thus may provide a mechanism to alter the functional
state of granule cells (parra et al. 1998).
the activity of interneurons is regulated by both gabaaand gabab-receptor–mediated inhibition. gabaa-receptor–
mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and currents (ipsp/
cs) have been examined in interneurons in several different
regions of the hippocampal formation (buckmaster and
schwartzkroin 1995; hájos and mody 1997; lacaille 1991;
lacaille and schwartzkroin 1988a,b; lacaille et al. 1987; misgeld and frotscher 1986; morin et al. 1996; soltesz and mody
1994; williams et al. 1994). these ipsp/cs are thought to
contribute a necessary timing mechanism for rhythmic oscillation in interneuronal networks and thereby contribute to the
generation of gamma frequency oscillations (20 –100 hz) in
principal cells (wang and buzsáki 1996; whittington et al.
1995). in contrast, the role of gabab-receptor–mediated inhibition in interneurons is less clear. gabab ipsp/cs have
been reported in hippocampal interneurons (buckmaster and
schwartzkroin 1995; khazipov et al. 1995; lacaille 1991);
however, they have not been examined in detail. to understand
how dentate-hilar border interneurons are regulated. we first

gabab inhibition in dentate interneurons

phological properties of the interneurons. therefore a primary
aim of this study was to characterize gabab-receptor–mediated ipsp/cs in morphologically identified d/h border zone
interneurons.
a second aim of this study was to determine the role of
gabab inhibition in regulating the activity of these interneurons. we previously have shown that activation of presynaptic
gabab autoreceptors on inhibitory terminals could suppress
the synaptic release of gaba and thereby disinhibit granule
cells (mott et al. 1990, 1993). however, the possibility exists
that gabab receptors located on the somatodendritic membrane of inhibitory interneurons may inhibit interneurons and
thus contribute to the disinhibition of granule cells. because of
its slower time course, gabab inhibition might be expected to
have markedly different effects on the frequency of interneuron
firing than does gabaa inhibition.
to address these issues, we used the whole cell patchclamp technique to record pharmacologically isolated slow
ipscs from visually identified interneurons at the dentatehilus border. the cells were filled with biocytin, allowing us
to reconstruct their axonal and dendritic arbors for anatomic
identification. we found marked heterogeneity in the magnitude of gabab responses in these interneurons that
largely correlated with their axonal distribution. in addition,
we found that ipspb inhibits interneuronal firing and powerfully suppresses n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) epsps.
we suggest that gabab inhibition modulates the activity of
d/h border zone interneurons and thereby plays an important role in regulating neuronal activity in the dentate gyrus.
methods

slice preparation and recording
transverse 300-mm brain slices were prepared from halothaneanesthetized male sprague-dawley rats (16- to 30-days old) using a
vibraslicer (campden 752), and the hippocampal formation was
gently dissected free of the remainder of the brain slice. hippocampal
slices were incubated in warmed (32–34°c), artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (acsf) containing (in mm): 120 nacl, 25 nahco3, 10 dextrose, 3.3 kcl, 1.23 nah2po4, 1.8 cacl2, and 1.2  xxxd2534xxx , bubbled
with a 95% o2-5% co2 gas mixture at ph 7.4. for recording, slices
were placed into a small submersion chamber maintained at 32–34°c
and held in place by a bent piece of platinum wire resting on the
surface of the slice. transilluminated slices were viewed with an
upright nikon optophot microscope with a 340 water immersion
objective, hoffman modulation contrast optics and infrared filtering.
our whole cell voltage-clamp technique has been described in our
previous publications (mott et al. 1993; xie et al. 1992). briefly,
recordings were made with microelectrodes (3– 6 mv) pulled from
borosilicate glass capillary tubing (1.5 mm od, 1.05 mm id, world
precision instruments, sarasota, fl) on a flaming-brown microelectrode puller. the intracellular solution contained (in mm): 130 kgluconate, 7 kcl, 10 hepes, 2 mgatp, and 0.3 trisgtp, and ph
adjusted to 7.2 with koh. biocytin (sigma chemical, st. louis, mo)
0.2– 0.4% was added for later visualization of the neuron morphology.
osmolalities were from 260 to 275 mosm for pipette solutions and
284 mosm for the acsf.
when used as the internal anion, gluconate has been reported to
interact with some types of potassium channels (zhang et al. 1994) but
not the  xxxg828xxx -coupled potassium conductance (lenz et al.
1997). however, to confirm this, we compared ipscbs in a group of
13 interneurons recorded with our gluconate-containing internal solution to the ipscbs in a group of 9 interneurons recorded with an

1439

internal solution in which gluconate had been replaced with an
equimolar concentration of methylsulfate. we found no difference in
the slope conductance of ipscb between these groups of cells (independent t-test, p . 0.87), indicating that gluconate had no specific
effect on the gabab conductance recorded in this study.
stimuli were 0.1-ms, monophasic, cathodal, rectangular, constant
current pulses (10 –1,000 ma) delivered through a monopolar tungsten electrode placed in the outer molecular layer. an axopatch 1d
amplifier with filtering at 3 khz and series resistance compensation
and capacitance compensation set at zero was used. series resistance
was monitored during the recording, and cells were discarded if seal
breakdown or sealing over was detected. responses were digitized
and recorded on magnetic disks using a nicolet digital oscilloscope
(model 410). in addition, responses were digitized by a digidata 1200
a-d board (axon instruments, foster city, ca) in a pc-based computer using strathclyde electrophysiology software whole cell program developed and generously provided by john dempster.
cells selected for recording had somata located near the hilar
border of the gcl, were distinctively larger than granule cells, and
exhibited basilar dendrites entering the hilus. on entry into the cells,
current injections were performed to record typical trains of action
potentials. if the cell did not exhibit the typical deep monophasic spike
afterhyperpolarizations seen in interneurons in this area, it was not
used (mott et al. 1997; scharfman 1992).

fixation, histochemistry, and reconstruction
our methods have been described previously (mott et al. 1997).
briefly, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1%
gluteraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and 75-mm sections were cut
on a vibratome. sections were incubated in avidin-horseradish peroxidase solution (vectastain abc standard kit) for 2–4 h, washed, and
incubated in phosphate buffer containing 0.05% 39-3-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride, cocl2 (0.025%), and ninh4so4 (0.02%) for 15 min
and then h2o2 (0.1% final concentration) until cells were visible. for
neuron reconstruction, cells were traced across all sections using a 3100
oil immersion lens and a three-dimensional neuronal reconstruction system consisting of an automated stage and a high resolution monitor
(neurolucida, microbrightfield, colchester, vt).
recovery of the stained cell was achieved in 52 of 110 interneurons
from which electrophysiological data were used in this report. the 58
cells in which morphology was not recovered were classified as
putative interneurons based on their visual appearance during recording and electrophysiological characteristics (see preceding text). of
the 52 cells from which anatomy could be recovered, identification of
axon morphology was possible in 35. in those interneurons the axons
of which were well stained, the distribution of the axons in the dentate
could be classified into four patterns previously described in detail by
mott et al. (1997), and the reader is referred to that publication for a
more extensive discussion of the interneuron morphology. interneurons, such as basket and axo-axonic cells, the axons of which arborized primarily in the granule cell layer, were termed gcl cells.
cells with axons that ramified throughout the molecular layer were
termed tml cells. many of these tml cells may represent the
pyramidal interneurons described by soriano and frotscher (1993).
cells with axons primarily in the inner molecular layer were termed
iml cells and most likely correspond to the hilar commissuralassociational pathway (hicap) cells of han et al. (1993). finally,
cells with axons preferring the outer molecular layer are termed oml
cells. these cells resemble the hilar perforant pathway-associated
(hipp) cells of han et al. (1993).

electrophysiology
resting membrane potential for each neuron was determined at the
beginning of the experiment by the voltage offset accompanying cell
access and rechecked at the end of the experiment by measuring the

amplitude of the dc offset produced when the cell access was lost.
we have corrected for a junction potential of 10 mv by setting the
values reported herein  xxxd1891xxx  mv more hyperpolarized than the values
read off the amplifier. the input resistance of each neuron was
determined in current clamp from the amplitude of the voltage deflection produced by a current injection of small amplitude (10 –
50 pa).
interneuron recordings lasted 20 – 60 min. during these recordings,
a gradual run down in the amplitude of synaptic currents was noted
but not specifically studied. despite the presence of atp and gtp in
the pipette solutions, nmda epscs, in particular, ran down with
time. in contrast, gabaa ipscs were clearly less prone to this
problem and gabab ipscs did not show a consistent decrease. the
average change in peak amplitude during the first 30 min of recording,
expressed as percent of the initial peak amplitude of the evoked psc,
was (mean 6 se) 276 6 20% for nmda epscs (n 5 10 cells),
219 6 4.9% (n 5 8 cells) for gabaa ipscs, and 210 6 7.4% for
gabab ipscs (n 5 8 cells).
values of experimental measurements are given in the results as
means 6 se followed by sample number (n). statistical significance
was determined using the student’s t-test or one-way anova with
post hoc bonferroni tests.
decay kinetics of the ipscs were analyzed using curve fitting
functions in strathclyde electrophysiology software whole cell program (version 1.1) and in microcal origin 5.0 (microcal software,
northhampton, ma). for the evoked ipscs, each trace fitted was an
average of three to five evoked responses. each trace was fitted to both
a monoexponential and biexponential decay curve. several criteria
were used to conclude whether a given decay phase was better
represented by a biexponential or a monoexponential function. one
criterion was the ratio of the residual variance of the fit to the
background variance as measured by the software. a second criterion
was simple visual inspection and often it was quite evident which
equation was the better fit to the data. in many cases, the two time
constants derived from the biexponential fit differed very little, i.e., by
a factor of #2, suggesting to us that the most parsimonious interpretation was a monoexponential decay.
reversal potentials for the ipscs were determined from current
voltage (i-v) curves of the ipscs elicited at different holding potentials. the expected reversal potential for potassium currents is 297
mv calculated using the nernst equation with our extracellular potassium concentration of 3.3 mm and intracellular concentration of
137 mm (hille 1992).

drugs
six,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione ( xxxd1918xxx ; 20 mm) and d(2)-2amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (d-apv) (50 mm) were purchased
from tocris cookson (bristol, uk). when nmda-receptor–mediated
currents were studied, 10 mm  xxxd1918xxx  was used. bicuculline methiodide (20 mm) and  xxxd2947xxx  (75 mm) were purchased from sigma
chemical . qx 314 was obtained from astra pharmaceutical products, (worcester, ma). gabab antagonists cgp 35348 and cgp
55845 and the agonist (6)baclofen were supplied generously by
novartis pharma ag (basel). all drugs were bath applied in the
perfusion medium. drugs were washed on until a steady-state effect
was observed before any measurements were taken. all drugs were
dissolved directly into the acsf except  xxxd1918xxx , which first was
dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and then added to the acsf.
results

in this study we recorded from 110 interneurons at the
border of the hilus and the granule cell layer in the dentate
gyrus. the input resistance of these interneurons averaged
242 6 20 mv and the resting potential averaged 266.0 6 0.7

mv. their morphological and passive electrotonic parameters
have been described previously (mott et al. 1997). in addition,
we also recorded from 18 granule cells for comparison with the
interneurons. these granule cells had an average input resistance of 324 6 38 mv and rested at 282.2 6 1.9 mv,
significantly more hyperpolarized than the interneurons (p ,
0.001, independent t-test).
slow ipscs
the slow ipsc was examined in 63 interneurons. in the
absence of antagonists a single stimulus to the ml evoked a
large fast epsc followed in most cells by a slow ipsc.
application of  xxxd1918xxx  (20 mm), d-apv (50 mm), bicuculline
methiodide (20 mm), and  xxxd2947xxx  (75 mm) blocked the
ampa, nmda, and gabaa components of the response,
respectively, leaving a slow ipsc in 55 of the 63 interneurons
(fig. 1). spontaneous slow ipscs were not observed. in 32 of
the 55 cells that exhibited a pharmacologically isolated slow
ipsc, we delivered a stimulus which evoked a maximal response. the maximal amplitude of the slow ipsc at a holding
potential of 270 mv averaged 22.8 6 2.6 pa but varied
markedly over a range from 1.6 to 56.9 pa. eight of the 63
interneurons exhibited no detectable slow ipsc despite strong
and/or repetitive stimulation and the presence of a robust epsc
in the absence of antagonists. these eight cells appeared electrophysiologically healthy in that they had an input resistance
(268 6 30 mv) similar to the average of all interneurons and
hyperpolarized resting potentials (263.0 6 1.7 mv). in contrast to interneurons, a slow ipsc was present in all 18 granule
cells examined. in 10 of these granule cells, we pharmacologically isolated the slow ipsc and delivered a stimulus that
evoked a maximal response. in these cells, the maximal amplitude of the slow ipsc averaged 35.7 6 6.6 pa (range:
8.8 – 69.9 pa), significantly larger than that recorded from
interneurons (p , 0.05, independent t-test).
the gabab antagonist, cgp 35348 (400 mm) was applied
to seven interneurons. it reversibly blocked the slow ipsc in
four of these cells (fig. 2a). however, in the remaining three
cells, this antagonist only partially reduced the peak current
(fig. 2c). similar results were obtained with the more potent
 xxxg828xxx  antagonist, cgp 55845. application of a
maximal concentration of cgp 55845 (1 mm) in a separate
group of eighteen cells blocked the slow ipsc in 10, but 8 were
partially resistant to this antagonist (fig. 2c). furthermore
increasing the concentration of cgp 55845 to 10 mm in three
of these cells produced no further reduction in the slow ipsc.
in contrast, 1 mm cgp 55845 blocked the slow ipsc in all 10
granule cells tested (fig. 2d). thus in contrast to principal cells
where the slow ipsc was entirely gabab-receptor mediated,
the slow ipsc in some d/h border zone interneurons appeared
to be mediated by both gabab receptors and receptors insensitive to gabab antagonists.
at a holding potential of 270 mv, the high concentration of
glutamate and gabaa receptor antagonists used in this study
was sufficient to block all inward currents in every granule cell
tested (n 5 10). in contrast, a small inward current remained in
36 of 63 interneurons (see figs. 3b and 8a). therefore where
indicated, this resistant epsc was subtracted from the waveform to isolate the ipscb.

baclofen effects
baclofen (10 mm) produced an outward current in 19 of 27
interneurons and 5 of 5 granule cells on which it was applied
(fig. 3a). in the 19 interneurons in which baclofen produced a
current the amplitude of this current at a holding potential of
270 mv averaged 39.5 6 6.8 pa. this was slightly smaller
than the average amplitude of the baclofen current in granule
cells at a holding potential of 270 mv (42.9 6 14.4 pa).
subsequent application of the  xxxg828xxx  antagonist
cgp 55845 (1 mm) fully reversed the effect of baclofen in all
cells tested.
the eight interneurons that did not exhibit a baclofen current
had high-input resistances (306.5 6 65.2 mv) and hyperpolarized membrane potentials (261.0 6 2.1 mv), suggesting
that they were electrophysiologically healthy. in five of these
cells, we were unable to evoke a slow ipsc (see preceding
text), suggesting that these interneurons did not possess
gabab-receptor–activated potassium currents. in contrast, the
remaining three cells did exhibit a slow ipsc. although this
ipsc was suppressed by baclofen, it recovered in the presence
of cgp 55845 (1 mm), suggesting that it was not gabab-

receptor mediated. thus these findings suggest the presence of
a subgroup of interneurons in the dentate hilar border region
that lack gabab-receptor–activated potassium currents.
application of baclofen to both interneurons and granule
cells consistently resulted in the disappearance of ipscb, presumably due to a reduction of gaba release or to saturation of
the gabab response by baclofen. interestingly, one interneuron in which the large baclofen current was antagonized completely by cgp 55845 also had a prominent slow ipsc that
was only minimally sensitive to cgp 55845 (fig. 3b). this
disparity in the ability of cgp 55845 to antagonize the baclofen current and the ipsc suggests that cgp-55845–sensitive gabab receptors were present on the postsynaptic membrane of this interneuron but were only minimally activated by
synaptically released gaba.
ipscb heterogeneity
in 13 interneurons that were treated with gabab antagonists, we recovered sufficient biocytin staining to compare the
maximal amplitude of ipscb with the morphology of the cell.

remaining 3 cells. in each cell, the slow ipscs returned to almost full amplitude after washout of the antagonist. similarly, cgp
55845 (1 mm) reduced the slow ipsc in all 18 cells tested. however, 8 of these cells exhibited an antagonist resistant component.

antagonist produced .92% suppression in every cell tested (n 5 10). histogram shows the mean and standard error for suppression
by the antagonist in these cells.

the amplitude of the gabab component of the slow ipsc in
each of these cells was determined by subtracting the antagonist-treated waveform from the control waveform. the maximal amplitude of the ipscb did not correlate with somatic
shape or dendritic morphology but did correlate with axonal
distribution. the ipscb in interneurons with axons which
projected to the inner molecular layer (iml cells) and granule
cell layer (gcl cells) was similar in amplitude to that recorded
from granule cells (fig. 4a). in contrast, the ipscb in interneurons with axons projecting to the outer molecular layer
(oml cells) and the total molecular layer (tml cells) was
significantly smaller. the difference in ipscb amplitude between these groups of interneurons could not be explained by
differences in their input resistance, as the input resistance of
tml/oml cells (204.0 6 25.5 mv) was similar to that of
gcl/iml cells (171.0 6 24.2 mv). in contrast to ipscb, the

amplitude of the antagonist-resistant component of the slow
ipsc was not different in interneurons with axons projecting to
perisomatic (10.3 6 3.4 pa, n 5 3) or dendritic (10.2 6 5.0
pa, n 5 3) regions of granule cells.
the differences in ipscb amplitude could be caused by
differences in our ability to activate gabaergic input to these
cells. therefore in nine interneurons, we compared the amplitude of the outward current elicited by baclofen with the axonal
projection of that cell. the input resistance (195.3 6 43.9 mv)
and resting membrane potential (255.0 6 3.1 mv) of gcl/
iml cells combined (n 5 5) was similar to that of tml/oml
cells combined (222.8 6 50.4 mv; 255.3 6 1.6 mv, n 5 4).
however, like our findings with ipscb, baclofen produced a
twofold larger current in gcl/iml cells than in tml/oml

interneurons with axons projecting to the granule cell dendrites.
voltage dependence and conductance of ipscb
in seven cells it was possible to construct complete currentvoltage curves from subtracted ipscbs. in each cell we measured the peak amplitude of the isolated ipscb over a range of
voltages. a regression line was then fit to each of these curves
so that the average slope conductance and reversal potential
could be determined. to average the curves between cells,
peak currents within a given neuron were normalized to the
peak current at 270 mv. the normalized measurements from
each cell then were averaged together to produce the i-v curves
shown in fig. 5. as these i-v curves show, the ipscb in both
interneurons and granule cells exhibited no rectification over
the range of potentials studied (fig. 5a). the reversal potential
of ipscb in interneurons was 296.7 6 1.9 mv, identical to the
calculated reversal potential of 297 mv for a potassium conductance. this reversal potential also compared well with that

of 294.6 6 2.0 mv for the ipscb obtained from four granule
cells.
in six interneurons the voltage dependence of the baclofen
current was examined by delivering voltage ramps from 270
to 2120 mv in control, in baclofen and after application of
cgp 55845. subtraction of the ramp delivered in baclofen
from the average of the ramps delivered in control and cgp
55845 revealed the component of the ramp current produced by
baclofen (fig. 5b). unlike ipscb, the baclofen current displayed some inward rectification over the range of membrane
potentials tested. the reversal potential of this current averaged
297.9 6 3.4 mv, similar to that of ipscb. in comparison, the
reversal potential of the baclofen current in granule cells averaged 91.3 6 1.2 mv (n 5 3).
in five of the seven interneurons in which the i-v relationship of ipscb was examined, a ml stimulus was used that
evoked a maximal ipscb. in these cells, the slope conductance
of ipscb averaged 0.75 6 0.12 ns (n 5 5; range: 0.6 –1.35
ns). this value is significantly smaller (p , 0.05, independent
t-test) than the ipscb conductance measured in granule cells
(1.31 6 0.23 ns, n 5 3). similarly, the conductance of the

perisomatic than dendritic regions of granule cells. a: ipscb amplitude in
interneurons with axons which projected to the dendrites (tml/oml cells,

presence of cgp 55845 (1 mm) and subtracted these responses
from the control responses in that cell. on average, the
summed ipscb plateaued after about seven stimuli at an amplitude that was 3.8-fold larger than that of a single maximal
ipscb in the same cells (fig. 6). both the peak latency (164 6
16%) and the duration (147 6 13%) of the summed response
to 10 stimuli were markedly longer than those of a single
response.
the total charge carried by the gabab current was determined from the net area of ipscb. this measurement revealed
that on the second and third responses of the train the charge
carried by the summed ipscb was actually potentiated relative
to the theoretical response expected assuming linear summation of the first maximal ipscb (fig. 6c). however, beginning
with the fourth stimulus, the summed ipscb rapidly fell below
this theoretical response. thus by the end of the train, the
response to the 10th stimulus added little to the total charge
flux of the summed ipscb beyond that evoked by the 7th
stimulus.

baclofen current, calculated from the amplitude of voltage
steps delivered in control, baclofen, and cgp 55845, was
smaller in interneurons (1.7 6 0.3 ns) than in granule cells
(2.6 6 0.6 ns);, however, this difference was not significant.
ipscb kinetics
ipscb kinetics were examined in all 25 interneurons to
which we applied gabab antagonists. for each interneuron,
the gabab component of the slow ipsc was isolated by
subtracting the antagonist resistant pscs. the kinetics of these
isolated ipscbs were studied at a holding potentials of 270
mv. gabab currents exhibited an onset latency ranging from
18 to 50 ms, a peak latency of 114 to 207 ms, and a duration
of 452 to 2,110 ms. although we found no significant difference in the onset or peak latency of ipscb in interneurons and
granule cells, we did find a difference in the decay of the
gabab current (table 1). the duration of ipscb in interneurons was significantly shorter than that in granule cells (p ,
0.05, independent t-test). in addition, in interneurons ipscb
exhibited a single exponential decay while, in 9 of the 10
granule cells, ipscb was better fit with a biexponential decay
curve. the ipsc in the remaining granule cell was best fit with
a single exponential curve with a decay t value of 410 ms.
biphasic current decay in granule cells has been reported
previously (otis et al. 1993).
summation of ipscb during high-frequency stimulation
we examined summation of isolated ipscbs by delivering
100-hz stimulus trains with up to 10 stimuli (n 5 4). the
stimulus intensity was set to evoke an ipscb of maximal
amplitude. to isolate the gabab component of the response,
we repeated the series of stimulus trains in each cell in the

inhibition of interneuron firing by ipspa and ipspb
we compared the ability of gabaa and gabab inhibition
to inhibit interneuron firing (n 5 6). in current clamp and in the
presence of 20 mm  xxxd1918xxx  and 50 mm d-apv, a monosynaptic
ipsp was evoked during a 2-s-long depolarization-induced
train of action potentials (fig. 7). the monosynaptic ipsp
consisted of a fast gabaa ipsp and a slow ipsp. we selected
cells in which the slow ipsp kinetics were similar to those of
ipspb to ensure that this response was produced primarily by
 xxxg828xxx  activation. with small current injections, the
firing rate of the interneuron was slow and both ipsps were
able to completely stop action potential discharge. however, as
the amplitude of the current injection increased, the firing rate
of the interneuron increased and ipspb, but not ipspa, became
almost completely ineffective. thus ipspa powerfully inhibited interneuron firing at all tested membrane potentials,
whereas ipspb produced a hyperpolarizing inhibition that was
effective only during weak to moderate depolarizations.

minutes after the addition of cgp 55845 (1 mm), ipspb was blocked, causing
the nmda epsp to widen. four minutes after adding cgp 55845, the same
stimulus evoked a delayed polysynaptic burst riding on a depolarizing slow
wave. addition of 50 mm d(2)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (d-apv)
blocked the nmda epsp except for the small remaining resistant component.

stimuli delivered to the outer molecular layer (1) demonstrate paired-pulse
depression of the nmda epsp by the ipspb. first stimulus of the pair evoked
an nmda epsp followed by an ipspb. second stimulus, delivered 150 ms
later, during the ipspb elicited an nmda epsp that was markedly suppressed.
the addition of cgp 35348 (400 mm) blocked the ipspb, allowing the 2
nmda epsps to summate. wash of the cgp 35348 reversed the effect.
current was injected to depolarize this cell to 266 mv during stimulation. d:
bar graph shows the effect of cgp 35348 (400 mm) on paired pulse depression
of the nmda epsp in a group of 6 interneurons. ordinate shows the ratio of
the amplitude of the second nmda epsp to that of the 1st nmda epsp
before the application of cgp 35348 (ctrl), during bathing in the antagonist
(cgp 35348) and after wash (wash). cgp 35348 significantly reduced paired
pulse depression of the nmda epsp (** p , 0.01, anova with post hoc
bonferroni test). amplitude of the first nmda epsp of each pair was
measured as the difference from the membrane potential at the time of the
stimulus to the peak depolarization during that epsp. amplitude of the 2nd
nmda epsp of the pair was measured in the same fashion after subtraction
of the response to a single stimulus. e: comparison of the effect of ipspb on
nmda (n 5 20) and ampa epsps (n 5 3). paired stimuli 150 ms apart were
delivered such that the 2nd epsp was evoked at the peak of the ipspb. only
the nmda epsp was significantly depressed (** p , 0.01, paired t test).
epsp amplitudes were measured as described above.

some cells. application of cgp 35348 (400 mm) blocked the
ipspb and increased the duration of the nmda epsp by 5.0 6
0.8 fold (fig. 8a). because of this longer duration, the area of

these responses was increased by .2.5-fold (fig. 8b). similarly, the latency to peak of the response increased from 48.1 6
2.8 ms to 68.1 6 6.0 ms, a significant difference (p , 0.05,
paired t -test). thus when gabaa inhibition is reduced, ipspb
appears to be capable of markedly truncating the nmda epsp
in these interneurons.
to further demonstrate the effect of ipspb on the nmda
epsps, a paired-pulse paradigm was used in which a test
stimulus was delivered to the ml 150 –200 ms after a conditioning stimulus, near the peak of the ipspb. the effect of
ipspb on the nmda epsp was quantitated by measuring the
amplitude of the conditioning epsp from baseline and the
amplitude of the test epsp in a similar manner after subtraction
of the conditioning waveform. the amplitude of the test
nmda epsp was clearly depressed in 19 of 20 interneurons
tested (fig. 8, c–e). in cells in which cgp 35348 (400 mm)
blocked the ipspb, it also significantly reduced depression of
the test epsp (fig. 8d). however, blockade of ipspb did not
completely eliminate depression of the nmda epsp. the
inability of this antagonist to completely block the depression,
despite its complete blockade of ipspb, suggests that factors
other than cgp 35348-sensitive gabab receptors also may
contribute to the depression.
a paired-pulse paradigm also was used to evaluate the effect
of ipspb on ampa epsps. ampa epsps were isolated by
blockade of nmda and gabaa responses with d-apv (50
mm), bmi (20 mm), and  xxxd2947xxx  (75 mm). these epsps
could be blocked by subsequent application of  xxxd1918xxx  (10
mm). as opposed to its effect on the nmda epsp, ipspb had
no effect on the ampa epsp (fig. 8e), suggesting that presynaptic depression of glutamate release did not contribute to
paired-pulse depression of nmda epsps.
discussion

the principal findings of this study were that in most d/h
border zone interneurons, ml stimulation evoked ipscbs similar to those in granule cells; a subpopulation of these interneurons lacked gabab currents; the amplitude of gabab
currents was larger in interneurons with perisomatic projections than in those with dendritic projections; ipspbs inhibited
depolarization-induced interneuronal firing during weak, but
not strong depolarizations; and ipspbs effectively blocked
nmda but not ampa epsps.
ipscbs
ipscbs have been reported in principal cells throughout the
hippocampal formation as well as in interneurons in ca1
stratum pyramidale (lacaille 1991; sik et al. 1995) and lacunosum-moleculare (khazipov et al. 1995). however, this current has not been examined in detail in any interneuronal
population. in this study, we have examined the kinetics of
ipscbs recorded from d/h border zone interneurons. we
found that the onset and peak latency of ipscb in these
interneurons were similar to those observed in granule cells
both in this study as well as in previous reports (hablitz and
thalmann 1987; mott et al. 1993; otis et al. 1993; staley and
mody 1992; thalmann and ayala 1982; xie et al. 1992).
however, the decay rate of ipscb in interneurons and granule
cells differed. in interneurons ipscbs decayed significantly

gabab inhibition in dentate interneurons

more rapidly than in granule cells and with monoexponential
kinetics, whereas in granule cells they decayed with biexponential kinetics. the mechanism underlying this difference is
unknown; however, it may reflect diversity in the subunit
composition of either the effector  xxxg1232xxx  or the g
protein responsible for the gabab-receptor–mediated current.
during rhythmic activity in the dentate network, these differences in the decay of ipscb in interneurons and granule cells
suggest corresponding differences in the frequency range over
which the ipscb will produce inhibition in these two cell
types.
as in granule cells (de koninck and mody 1997; otis et al.
1993), ipscb in interneurons exhibited a nonrectifying current-voltage relation over a range of membrane potentials from
2120 to 260 mv. in contrast, over a similar voltage range the
baclofen current showed some inward rectification. inward
rectification of the baclofen current also has been reported in
ca3 pyramidal cells (sodickson and bean 1996). the reason
for this difference in the i-v relationship between synaptically
evoked currents and baclofen currents is unclear.
the conductance of ipscb in d/h border zone interneurons
was quite small (;0.75 ns), consistent with its proposed function to provide hyperpolarizing inhibition (misgeld et al.
1989). given the single channel conductance of 5–11 ps reported for gabab-linked potassium channels (de koninck
and mody 1997; premkumar et al. 1990), this corresponds to
the contribution of 70 –150 channels to the peak of a single
maximal ipscb. the conductance of ipscb in both interneurons and granule cells was clearly smaller than that reported in
hippocampal pyramidal cells (range 6 –19 ns) (hablitz and
thalmann 1987; oleskevich and lacaille 1992; rovira et al.
1990), suggesting that the functional effects of ipscb in interneurons may be weaker than in pyramidal cells.
as in principal cells, repetitive stimulation was more effective than single stimuli at activating gabab receptors on
interneurons. this is thought to occur because gabab receptors are located extrasynaptically and therefore require gaba
spillover from the synaptic cleft for their activation (isaacson et
al. 1993; thompson and gähwiler 1992). during the second
and third pulses of the train, the amplitude of the individual
ipscbs did not run down but instead was potentiated as might
be expected if gaba spillover is increased. after these initial
responses, the amplitude of individual ipscbs progressively
declined during the train, such that stimuli after the seventh
added little to the overall response. this progressive decline in
the amplitude of individual responses may reflect gaba depletion, increased gaba uptake, or the activation of presynaptic gabab receptors capable of suppressing further gaba
release (mott et al. 1993). taken together, this behavior suggests that gabab receptors in these interneurons are optimally
activated by short bursts of inhibitory afferent activation, such
as occurs during rhythmic oscillation in the hippocampal formation (ranck 1973).
ipscb heterogeneity
gabab current amplitude in interneurons exhibited marked
heterogeneity. the lack of both a baclofen current and a slow
ipsc in some d/h border zone interneurons suggests the
existence of a subpopulation of these interneurons that lack
functional gabab-receptor–activated potassium currents. in

1447

those cells that expressed a gabab current, the maximal
amplitude of this current correlated with the axonal projection
of the interneuron. the heterogeneity in baclofen current amplitude could not be explained by differences in the dendritic
surface area, as there is little difference between the total
dendritic length of interneurons that project to perisomatic and
dendritic regions of granule cells (mott et al. 1997). alternately, because of the slow kinetics of ipscb, the difference in
ipscb amplitude between these groups of interneurons is unlikely to be caused by differences in dendritic filtering. furthermore we have found previously that the electrotonic length
of both tml and oml cells is slightly shorter than that of
gcl and iml cells (mott et al. 1997). therefore we suggest
that interneurons that project to perisomatic regions of granule
cells express greater postsynaptic  xxxg828xxx  function
than do interneurons which project to dendritic regions.
a number of possible mechanisms may account for postsynaptic differences in  xxxg828xxx  function. first, it is possible that some interneurons may simply lack or contain fewer
gabab receptors. a second possibility is that these interneurons may contain different subtypes of  xxxg828xxx 
(kaupmann et al. 1997) that couple with differing efficiencies
to their effector mechanism. alternatively, the effector  xxxg1232xxx  may be expressed more abundantly in some
interneurons or different subtypes may be expressed. a fourth
possibility is that a component of the  xxxg828xxx  system
may be persistently downregulated in interneurons that project
to dendritic regions of granule cells.
a growing body of evidence indicates that distinct groups of
interneurons express receptors for different neurotransmitters.
receptors that have been reported to be differentially expressed in subgroups of interneurons include serotonin (kawa
1994; morales and bloom 1997), muscarinic (behrends and
ten bruggencate 1993), nicotinic (mcquiston and madison
1999), noradrenergic (bergles et al. 1996), and metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mcbain et al. 1994). similarly, lambert
and wilson (1993) have reported heterogeneity in presynaptic
 xxxg828xxx  function in ca3 interneurons. other studies
have reported the expression of glutamate (mcbain and
dingledine 1993) and gabaa receptors (gao and fritschy
1994) with different subunit composition in different subpopulations of interneurons. this diversity provides a mechanism
by which interneurons with distinct roles in hippocampal computation might be differentially regulated. the heterogeneous
expression of gabab currents in d/h border zone interneurons may provide another means for the differential modulation
of these interneurons.
the animals used in this study were between 16- and 30days old. seress and ribak (1990) reported that by day 16 the
axonal plexus of basket cells was typically distributed and
relatively mature. therefore it is not clear that the axonal
distribution of other dentate interneurons would be expected to
change dramatically after day 16. although the axonal morphology of d/h border zone interneurons may be developmentally mature, it is unknown whether the expression pattern of
postsynaptic gabab receptors in these interneurons is still
maturing during the age range of animals used in this study. in
thalamic neurons, functional postsynaptic gabab receptors
are present at birth (warren et al. 1997);however, in hippocampal pyramidal cells. they are not present before the end of the
first postnatal week (gaiarsa et al. 1995). therefore although

we do not feel that it is likely, we cannot rule out the possibility
that differences in gabab function between these interneuronal groups may reflect differences in the developmental time
course of gabab receptors in some interneuron types.
resistant pscs
in addition to the differential expression of ipscb in d/h
border zone interneurons, we also saw heterogeneous expression of two unidentified currents. the first of these currents
was a slow ipsc that was resistant to gabab antagonists. it
was present in ;44% of d/h border zone interneurons. however, it was not observed in any of the granule cells tested and
has not been reported in principal cells (davies et al. 1993;
jarolimek et al. 1993; olpe et al. 1993) or l-m interneurons
(khazipov et al. 1995) of the hippocampus. it is not yet known
whether this current is present in other interneurons in the
hippocampal formation. the receptor mediating these resistant
slow ipscs is not known. it is possible that they are mediated
by a subtype of  xxxg828xxx  not sensitive to the antagonists used in this study (bonanno and raiteri 1993). alternatively, they may be produced by activation of a different
receptor system. dentate inhibitory interneurons are contacted
by serotonergic afferents from the median raphe (halasy et al.
1992), raising the possibility that the resistant ipsc is serotonergic. indeed, serotonin applied to pyramidal cells can evoke
a potassium conductance similar to ipscb (andrade et al.
1986; innis et al. 1988). alternatively, the resistant ipsc could
be an opioid-mediated potassium conductance (madison and
nicoll 1988; wimpey and chavkin 1991), although significant
release of opioids by a single ml stimulus seems unlikely
(wagner et al. 1990).
the second unidentified current in these interneurons was a
synaptically evoked inward current that was not blocked by
 xxxd1918xxx  and d-apv and was present in ;57% of the interneurons examined. it appeared similar to the spontaneous depolarizing synaptic response recorded from granule cells in the
presence of  xxxd1804xxx  (forti and michelson 1997). the
presence of each of these currents in a separate subpopulation
of d/h border zone interneurons suggests that, like gabab
receptors, they also may provide a means for the differential
modulation of certain subtypes of interneurons.
functional implications

responses mediated by voltage-dependent nmda receptors
but not those mediated by ampa receptors. inhibition of
nmda epsps by ipspb has been reported previously in ca1
pyramidal cells (morrisett et al. 1991) and in neurons of the
amygdala (huang and gean 1994). in d/h border zone interneurons, inhibition of nmda receptors by ipsp/cb may have
important consequences for rhythmic bursting, synaptic plasticity, and/or excitotoxicity in the dentate network. furthermore the ability of ipscb to suppress nmda currents may
serve an important compensatory role if gabaa inhibition is
compromised. these findings indicate that ipsp/cb inhibits the
response of these interneurons to slow and/or voltage-dependent excitatory stimuli, such as that mediated by nmda receptors, while leaving unaffected the response to strong fast
voltage-independent excitatory stimuli, such as that mediated
by ampa receptors. furthermore they suggest that gabab
inhibition may play an important role in shaping the excitatory
response of these interneurons and thus may contribute to the
gabab-receptor–mediated depression of inhibition previously reported in dentate granule cells (mott and lewis 1991;
mott et al. 1993).
conclusions
we conclude that gabab currents in d/h border zone
interneurons modulate interneuron firing rates and inhibit slow
excitatory currents. the heterogeneous expression of these
currents would produce different levels of gabab inhibition
in subpopulations of interneurons and thus permit these cells to
match the computational needs of their environment.

what may be the functional consequences of ipsc/pb in
these interneurons? the slow time course and small conductance increase associated with ipscb suggest that this form of
inhibition will play a more subtle role in regulating interneuron
function than does ipsca. in neocortical neurons (connors et
al. 1988), ipspb has been suggested as a mechanism to reduce
background neuronal firing. as in these neocortical neurons
(connors et al. 1988; mccormick 1989), ipspb in d/h border
zone interneurons was able to block action potentials evoked
by weak but not strong depolarizations, suggesting that it may
serve a similar function in these cells. strong membrane depolarization is thought to overcome gabab inhibition because
ipspb relies primarily on its ability to move the membrane
potential away from firing threshold to produce inhibition.
in support of this hyperpolarizing mechanism of inhibition,
ipscb in interneurons was able to inhibit excitatory synaptic
