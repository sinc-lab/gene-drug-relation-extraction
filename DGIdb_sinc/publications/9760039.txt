abstract
recombinant human žh.  xxxg1108xxx -mediated g-protein activation was characterised in membranes of transfected chinese
hamster ovary žcho. cells by use of guanosine-5x-o-ž3-w35sxthio.-triphosphate žw35sxgtpgs binding.. the potency and efficacy of 21
5-ht receptor agonists and antagonists was determined. the agonists, 5-ct žcarboxamidotryptamine. and flesinoxan displayed high
affinity žsubnanomolar k i values. and high efficacy ž emax ) 90%, relative to 5-ht s 100%.. in contrast, ipsapirone, zalospirone and
buspirone displayed partial agonist activity. ec 50 s for agonist stimulation of w35sxgtpgs binding correlated well with k i values from
competition binding ž r s q0.99.. among the compounds tested for antagonist activity, methiothepin and žq.butaclamol exhibited
‘ xxxd1422xxx ’ behaviour, inhibiting basal w35sxgtpgs binding. the actions of 17 antipsychotic agents were investigated. clozapine
and several putatively ‘atypical’ antipsychotic agents, including ziprasidone, quetiapine and tiospirone, exhibited partial agonist activity
and marked affinity at h5-ht1a receptors, similar to their affinity at hd 2 dopamine receptors. in contrast, risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx 
displayed low affinity at h5-ht1a receptors and behaved as ‘neutral’ antagonists, inhibiting 5-ht-stimulated w35sxgtpgs binding.
likewise the ‘typical’ neuroleptics, haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , raclopride and chlorpromazine exhibited relatively low affinity and ‘neutral’
antagonist activity at h5-ht1a receptors with k i values which correlated with their respective k b values. the present data show that ži.
w35sxgtpgs binding is an effective method to evaluate the efficacy and potency of agonists and antagonists at recombinant human
5-ht1a receptors. žii. like clozapine, several putatively ‘atypical’ antipsychotic drugs display balanced serotonin h5-ht1ardopamine
hd 2 receptor affinity and partial agonist activity at h5-ht1a receptors. žiii. several ‘typical’ and some putatively ‘atypical’ antipsychotic
agents displayed antagonist properties at h5-ht1a sites with generally much lower affinity than at hd 2 dopamine receptors. it is
suggested that agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors may be of utility for certain antipsychotic agents. q 1998 elsevier science b.v. all

1. introduction
the  xxxg1108xxx  is a member of the superfamily of
monomeric transmembrane g-protein-coupled receptors
and has been heterologously expressed in cos7 žafrican
green monkey kidney., hela, cho žchinese hamster
ovary., and other cell lines, enabling the study of its
coupling to g-proteins and second messenger systems

tors are localised as somatodendritic autoreceptors in raphe
nuclei and postsynaptically in corticolimbic structures such
as hippocampus and cortex, reflecting a key role in the
modulation of affective disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression žde vry, 1995; maes and meltzer,
1995; millan et al., 1997b..
5-ht1a receptors have also attracted interest as potential targets for novel antipsychotic agents. first, clinical
studies have reported that the  xxxg1108xxx  partial
agonist, buspirone, markedly ameliorates the lowered mood
and social withdrawal of schizophrenics, through its antianxiety effects žsovner and parnell-sovner, 1989; goff et
al., 1991; harvey and balon, 1995.. second, post-mortem
studies have shown that frontal cortex  xxxg1108xxx

from a functional deficiency in the frontal cortex, and in
rat dialysis studies,  xxxg1108xxx  agonists selectively
reinforce dopamine and noradrenaline release in this region, suggesting that  xxxg1108xxx  agonism may alleviate ‘hypofrontality’ žmillan et al., 1997b.. fifth, the ‘atypical’ antipsychotic, clozapine, which is clinically effective
against both positive and negative symptoms in the absence of extrapyramidal symptoms, displays marked affinity at human brain 5-ht1a receptors žmason and reynolds,
1992. and partial agonism at recombinant human 5-ht1a
receptors žnewman-tancredi et al., 1996a.. indeed, corbett et al. ž1993. suggested that the capacity of antipsychotic agents to treat psychotic symptoms in the absence
of extrapyramidal symptoms is due to agonist actions at
5-ht1a receptors. however, no direct evidence was provided to support this hypothesis and the present study
therefore undertook a systematic analysis of this issue by
investigating the intrinsic activity of antipsychotic agents
for modulation of  xxxg1108xxx -mediated signal transduction.
5-ht1a receptors modulate the activity of diverse second messenger pathways, including potassium and calcium
channels, inositol phosphate metabolism,  xxxd208xxx 
production and adenylyl cyclase activity žschoeffter and
hoyer, 1988; pauwels et al., 1993; boess and martin,
1994.. whilst these approaches yield valuable information
about  xxxg1108xxx  activation, they measure responses
which are several steps ‘downstream’ of the receptor per

density is increased in schizophrenic patients žhashimoto
et al., 1991; burnet et al., 1997.. third,  xxxg1108xxx 
agonists, such as 8-oh-dpat ž8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin., block the catalepsy induced in rats by neuroleptics such as haloperidol or raclopride žmcmillen et al.,
1988; andersen and kilpatrick, 1995., suggesting that an
antipsychotic agent which displays  xxxg1108xxx  agonist activity may show a lower incidence of extrapyramidal
symptoms in humans. fourth, schizophrenic patients suffer

se and depend on the cell types investigated žliu and
albert, 1991; raymond et al., 1993.. in addition, 5-ht1a
receptors can modulate different second messenger systems with different potencies žfargin et al., 1989; gudermann et al., 1996. or the same second messenger systems
in a different manner depending on brain region žclarke et
al., 1996; johnson et al., 1997.. these differing responses
complicate the interpretation of second messenger effects.
in contrast, both adenylyl cyclase inhibition and phosphoinositide hydrolysis are mediated by the same g-protein, at
least in hela cells žfargin et al., 1991., suggesting that
investigation of agonist activity at the g-protein level may
overcome some of these difficulties. odagaki and fuxe
ž1995. measured g-protein activation by determining
gtpase activity in rat hippocampal membranes, whilst
guanosine-5x-o-ž3-w35 sxthio.-triphosphate žw35 sxgtpgs.
binding methodology can be applied to 5-ht1a receptors
in recombinant systems žnewman-tancredi et al., 1996b,
1997a; stanton and beer, 1997..
the present study had several aims. first, to characterise the optimal experimental conditions for determination of agonist stimulation of 5-ht1a -receptor-mediated
w35 sxgtpgs binding in a cho cell line stably expressing
recombinant human 5-ht1a receptors. second, to evaluate
the agonistrantagonist activity žby stimulation of
w35 sxgtpgs binding. and binding affinity žby competition
with w3 hx8-oh-dpat. of serotonergic reference compounds. these include serotonergic agonists, antagonists,

247

and agents proposed for the treatment of affective disorders, such as buspirone and žq.flesinoxan. third, to investigate the  xxxg1108xxx  activity of a range of antipsychotic drugs. these included older antipsychotic agents,
such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx  and raclopride, which are known to provoke marked extrapyramidal
symptoms žmeltzer, 1996; baldessarini, 1996.. several
recent drugs, intended to display clozapine-like clinical
efficacy without extrapyramidal symptoms induction, were
also evaluated, including risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and  xxxd3195xxx  žschwartz and brotman,
1992; fleischhacker and hummer, 1997..

4. discussion
4.1. affinityr efficacy of 5-ht agonists at 5-ht1 a receptors
a range of serotonergic agonists and partial agonists
were tested for their capacity to stimulate  xxxg1108xxx 
mediated w35 sxgtpgs binding in cho-h5-ht1a membranes. the methoxynaphtylpiperazine ligand, s 14671,
was the most potent agonist tested, with virtually full
agonist activity, relative to 5-ht žtable 1; fig. 2c. consistent with its exceptionally potent and efficacious actions in
in vivo functional paradigms žmillan et al., 1992; schreiber
et al., 1994.. its analogue, s 14506 was also a highly
potent and efficacious ligand ž emax s 90%. in agreement
with previous in vivo studies žschreiber et al., 1994..
žq.uh 301 exhibited partial agonist activity at 5-ht1a
receptors ž emax s 35%. similar to that reported for inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in rat
hippocampal membranes ž47%, cornfield et al., 1991..
the roughly 20-fold difference between ec 50 values for
stimulation of w35 sxgtpgs binding and the respective k i
values for inhibition of w3 hx8-oh-dpat binding, probably
reflects the labelling by w3 hx8-oh-dpat of 5-ht1a receptors which are in a g-protein-coupled state žmongeau et
al., 1992; sundaram et al., 1993; gozlan et al., 1995.. in
contrast, ec 50 values probably correlate better with the
affinities of the ligands at uncoupled receptors žcornfield

251

et al., 1991; chamberlain et al., 1993.. the overall order
of potency of the agonists for activation of w35 sxgtpgs
binding corresponds closely to that for inhibition of w3 h x8oh-dpat binding ž r s 0.94. and agrees with the pharmacological profile of the classically characterised 5-ht1a
receptor. further, the efficacies reported here are positively
correlated with those reported using gtpase activity as a
measure of g-protein activation by native rat hippocampal
5-ht1a receptors žodagaki and fuxe, 1995; table 1 legend.. agonist efficacies determined at cho-h5-ht1a receptors are also broadly comparable with those for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in native brain hippocampal membranes žde vivo and maayani, 1986; schoeffter
and hoyer, 1988.. thus, whilst caution should be exercised in extrapolating data from recombinant to physiological systems žwhich are likely to express differing
levels of receptors andror g-proteins., the marked correspondence between the agonist efficacies determined by
w35 sxgtpgs binding in cho-h5-ht1a membranes and
those determined by gtpase or adenylyl cyclase determinations in hippocampal membranes is striking. thus, it
may be concluded that agonist-mediated stimulation of
w35 sxgtpgs binding to cho-h5-ht1a membranes, constitutes a model of activation of native hippocampal 5-ht1a
receptors.
in contrast, it is likely that agonist efficacies at presynaptic receptors would be ‘amplified’ by the presence of
‘spare receptors’. indeed, in cortical neurons in primary
culture, ipsapirone and buspirone act as antagonists whereas
in hippocampal neurons they acted as partial agonists
ždumuis et al., 1988.. further, ipsapirone acts as a full
agonist at presynaptic 5-ht1a autoreceptors žcox et al.,
1993.. these differences in efficacy have been attributed
to the presence of significant receptor reserve at presynaptic but not at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors žmeller et al.,
1990; yocca et al., 1992., a situation which may be
modelled by cell lines which express high densities of
recombinant 5-ht1a receptors žvarrault et al., 1992.. indeed, when cho-h5-ht1a cells were manipulated to express 3-fold more receptors, the partial agonist, eltoprazine, behaved virtually as a full agonist žnewman-tancredi
et al., 1997a..
4.2. affinityr potency of serotonergic antagonists at 5-ht1 a
receptors
marked differences were observed between the actions
of ‘antagonists’ žtable 2; fig. 2d.. the a 1r5-ht1a receptor ligand, nan 190 žglennon et al., 1988., demonstrated
its antagonist properties by a parallel shift of the 8-ohdpat stimulation curve, consistent with competitive antagonism. this suggests that its antagonist activity is predominant, at least in the present model of post-synaptic
5-ht1a receptors, although previous reports have shown
that it may exhibit some agonist properties at somatoden-

dritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors žgreuel and glaser, 1992;
lejeune et al., 1994..
in contrast, methiothepin and žq.butaclamol, as well as
spiperone, exhibited negative efficacy by concentration-dependently inhibiting w35 sxgtpgs binding below basal levels, indicating that they act as inverse agonists in this
system žresults, fig. 2c; newman-tancredi et al., 1997a..
it is interesting to note that methiothepin appears to exhibit
 xxxd1422xxx  activity at a range of serotonergic receptors
including  xxxg1110xxx  and 5-ht2c receptors žbarker et al.,
1994; thomas et al., 1995; stanton and beer, 1997..
further, žq.butaclamol exhibits negative efficacy at
dopamine d 2 receptors žhall and strange, 1997., whilst
spiperone discriminates differential affinity states of native
porcine dopamine d 2 žde lean et al., 1982. as well as
5-ht1a receptors žsundaram et al., 1993..
way 100,135, žy.uh 301 and the  xxxg1108xxx 
žand b-adrenergic. receptor antagonist, žy.tertatolol, acted
as ‘neutral’ antagonists, exhibiting antagonist activity
without any detectable agonist or  xxxd1422xxx  effects.
this is in accordance with previous ‘in vitro’ reports of the
actions of these compounds at post-synaptic 5-ht1a receptors žbjork et al., 1991; escandon et al., 1994., although
studies of raphe-localised serotonergic neuron firing suggest that way 100135, but not žy.uh 301 or
žy.tertatolol, may have some weak partial agonist action
žarborelius et al., 1994; escandon et al., 1994; lejeune et
al., 1994..
4.3. agonist actiõity of antipsychotic agents at 5-ht1 a
receptors
we have previously shown that the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, exhibits partial agonist properties for
stimulation of w35 sxgtpgs binding at cho-h5-ht1a cell
membranes žnewman-tancredi et al., 1996a.. the present
study confirms our previous report on clozapine and
demonstrates that several other putatively ‘atypical’ antipsychotic drugs also exhibit some agonist activity at
5-ht1a receptors žtable 3; fig. 4.. tiospirone, a buspirone analogue which is effective in the treatment of
psychoses with minimal extrapyramidal symptoms žjain et
al., 1987; moore et al., 1987., exhibits partial agonist
activity and has balanced hd 2rh5-ht1a receptor affinities.
quetiapine and ziprasidone displayed marked  xxxg1108xxx  agonist activity, similar to that of clozapine ž emax ;
50%. and also share clozapine’s balanced 5-ht1a rhd 2
receptor affinity žtable 3.. in vivo ziprasidone has a high
threshold for induction of catalepsy in rats, which seeger
et al. ž1995. tentatively attributed to its  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist actions. clozapine and, probably, quetiapine and
ziprasidone, display a distinctive clinical profile, compared
to the ‘typical’ antipsychotic, haloperidol, with a lower
incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and, possibly,
greater effectiveness against negative symptoms of

schizophrenia žfleischhacker and hummer, 1997; tollefson and sanger, 1997.. in contrast, although the preferential d 3 receptor antagonist, and potential antipsychotic
agent, nafadotride, showed marked efficacy at h5-ht1a
receptors ž emax s 68%., its affinity at this site was about
ten-fold lower than at dopamine hd 2 receptors žtable 3.
and about 100-fold lower than at hd 3 dopamine receptors
žsautel et al., 1995.. thus, nafadotride’s preferential
dopaminergic actions may be responsible for its induction
of catalepsy in vivo žsautel et al., 1995..
an important issue is the level of efficacy at 5-ht1a
receptors which is necessary for in vivo physiological and
behavioural effects to be expressed. bartoszyk et al. ž1996.
have shown that clozapine mediates some of its antianxiety
actions by a  xxxg1108xxx  mediated mechanism. further, the increase in frontal cortex dopamine levels induced
by clozapine is žat least partially. due to  xxxg1108xxx 
activation žrollema et al., 1997.. the selective 5-ht1a
receptor ligand žand anxiolytic drug. s 15535, ž emax s 35%
in the present system, newman-tancredi et al., 1996b.,
displays full agonist activity at presynaptic somatodendritic 5-ht1a receptors although acting as an antagonist in
in vivo models of post-synaptic  xxxg1108xxx  activation
žmillan et al., 1993, 1994.. these observations suggest that
efficacies equivalent or greater than that of buspirone, as
displayed by bmy 14802 and, possibly, fg 5893 and
quetiapine, may be necessary to observe post-synaptic
 xxxg1108xxx  effects žeg. hypothermia, serotonin syndrome. but lower efficacies would likely be sufficient to
provoke activation of 5-ht1a autoreceptors on serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei. thus the partial agonist
properties of clozapine, quetiapine and tiospirone, as well
as the more efficacious agonists, may be expressed physiologically at somatodendritic 5-ht1a sites. in contrast, although the tricyclic drug olanzapine is a structural analogue of clozapine žbymaster et al., 1996., it displayed
lower affinity at 5-ht1a receptors, with a 270-fold preference for dopamine hd 2 vs. serotonin h5-ht1a receptors,
compared with clozapine’s equilibrated 5-ht1a rhd 2 receptor affinities žtable 3.. further, olanzapine exhibited
only about half the efficacy of clozapine at cho-h5-ht1a
receptors ž24% vs. 53%.. thus, it may be hypothesised
that  xxxg1108xxx -mediated actions of clozapine are not
a feature of olanzapine’s therapeutic profile. nevertheless,
in clinical trials, olanzapine has significant effects in negative symptom improvement with a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms žtran et al., 1997. indicating that
activity at other receptor subtypes is also important. indeed, bartoszyk et al. ž1996. showed that the anticataleptic
action of clozapine was not reversed by the selective
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, way 100,635. further, bmy
14802, which in the present study displayed 10-fold selectivity for serotonin h5-ht1a vs. dopamine hd 2 receptors
with efficacious agonist activity ž emax s 82%, table 3. is
ineffective against schizophrenia in humans, whilst not
inducing extrapyramidal symptoms žgewirtz et al., 1994..

a. newman-tancredi et al.r european journal of pharmacology 355 (1998) 245–256

the relative importance of 5-ht1a vs. other receptor subtypes may be evaluated using novel antipsychotic agents
which display high affinity for h5-ht1a receptors. one
such putatively ‘atypical’ antipsychotic in clinical trials, s
16924, exhibits 25-fold h5-ht1a vs. hd 2 selectivity ž k i s
1.8 vs. 46 nm; millan et al., 1995a. and has clozapine-like
partial agonist properties at cho-h5-ht1a receptors ž emax
s 66%; newman-tancredi et al., 1995.. in vivo, s 16924,
like clozapine, blocks both amphetamine-induced locomotion and haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats.

253

types such as  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 žschotte et al., 1996;
seeman et al., 1997; millan et al., 1997a; roth et al.,
1998.. however, unlike clozapine, which is a 5-ht1a
receptor partial agonist, risperidone does dose-dependently
induce extrapyramidal symptoms, although at a lower incidence than haloperidol žschwartz and brotman, 1992;
fleischhacker and hummer, 1997., suggesting that an
additional agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors may help to
mimic a clozapine-like ‘atypical’ therapeutic profile.
4.5. conclusions

4.4. antagonist actiõity of antipsychotic agents at 5-ht1 a
receptors
spiperone is often used as a serotonergic antagonist
žescandon et al., 1994. and žq.butaclamol is used as a
stereoselective receptorial ligand for the in vitro study of
dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors žsundaram et al.,
1993; hall and strange, 1997.. however, these compounds
were originally intended as neuroleptic agents for the
treatment of psychosis and although spiperone has not
been tested as an antipsychotic agent in humans,
žq.butaclamol, an  xxxd1422xxx  at cho-h5-ht1a receptors, induces marked extrapyramidal symptoms in man
žclark et al., 1977.. other ‘typical’ antipsychotic drugs
which are known to induce extrapyramidal symptoms,
including chlorpromazine,  xxxd2956xxx  and haloperidol, displayed antagonist behaviour at cho-h5-ht1a receptors
žtable 2.. this group of ligands, including haloperidol,
raclopride, risperidone and  xxxd2956xxx , exhibited much
higher affinity at dopamine d 2 than at serotonin 5-ht1a
receptors žtable 3. with selectivity ratios of at least 80-fold.
this is also true of spiperone and žq.butaclamol, which
display k i values at hd 2 dopamine receptors of 0.06 and
1.3 nm žunpublished observation., i.e., at least two orders
of magnitude higher affinity that at h5-ht1a receptors
žtable 2..
it is tempting to speculate that equilibrated 5-ht1a rhd 2
receptor affinity and agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors
would impart an ‘atypical’ profile to antipsychotic agents.
however, as stated above, the profile of action of antipsychotic drugs at other receptor subtypes plays an important
role in reduced induction of extrapyramidal symptoms.
indeed, both  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone, which are widely
considered to exhibit certain ‘atypical’ features, displayed
marked selectivity for dopamine hd 2 vs. serotonin h5-ht1a
receptors ž k i ratios of 80 and 210, respectively; table 4,
fig. 4. and antagonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors. although antagonism at 5-ht1a receptors may be associated
with an amelioration of cognitive deficits and have promnesic proprieties žharder et al., 1996; buhot, 1997., it is
unlikely to be involved in reducing extrapyramidal symptoms. ‘atypicality’ may also be related to higher affinity at
serotonin 5-ht2a vs. dopamine d 2 receptors and actions at
d4 or d 3 receptors, as well as other 5-ht receptor sub-

the present study demonstrates that w35 sxgtpgs binding can be applied to cho-h5-ht1a receptors to characterise a wide range of agonist, antagonist and inverse
agonist ligands. the ligand binding and functional profile
of cho-h5-ht1a receptors resembles that of native hippocampal 5-ht1a receptors. the characterization of the
affinity and efficacy at h5-ht1a receptors of a range of
antipsychotic agents, indicates that, although the hypothesis that  xxxg1108xxx  agonism contributes to an ‘atypical’ profile is attractive, substantial further investigation is
required. nevertheless, clozapine and several other putatively atypical drugs displayed agonist activity at 5-ht1a
receptors whereas several ‘typical’ antipsychotic agents
did not. these observations suggest that, although high
intrinsic efficacy at  xxxg1108xxx  is insufficient, in
itself, for antipsychotic action, agonist activity at this site
may impart beneficial properties in the treatment of psychotic disorders.
