cocaine inhibits muscarinic cholinergic receptors in heart and brain.  (-)-cocaine inhibits m2 muscarinic cholinergic binding measured with [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate in heart and brain with a ki of 18.8 microm. the cyclic nucleotide  xxxd2928xxx  does not shift the competition curve, suggesting that (-)-cocaine is an antagonist. (-)-cocaine also reverses the  xxxd2586xxx -induced inhibition of guinea pig atrial contractions at a similar concentration. although (+)-cocaine is about 8-fold more potent than (-)-cocaine, (+)-cocaine is not present in extracts of the coca plant. of the many compounds tested, only (-)-cocaine and lidocaine have a higher affinity at m2 muscarinic receptors than at m1 receptors; other compounds such as (+)-cocaine, norcocaine, procaine and dimethocaine are equipotent at the m1 and m2 subtypes. these results indicate that cocaine can act as an antimuscarinic agent, particularly at higher, toxic doses.
