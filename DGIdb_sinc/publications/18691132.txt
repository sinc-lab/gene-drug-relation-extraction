abstract: this review describes symptoms and pathophysiology of parkinson’s diseases (pd) and restless legs syndrome
(rls), and discusses the relationship between clinical outcome of da agonists and their receptor-binding and
pharmacokinetics. oral da agonists are divided into 2 classes; the ergots and the non-ergots. both classes are in general
equally effective against pd motor symptoms. ergots (apart from bromocriptine) stimulate the da d1 subreceptor and
increase dyskinesia. furthermore, valvular heart disease (vhd) and pulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis appear to
represent a class effect of 8-aminoergolines as cabergoline and pergolide the side effects profile therefore seems more
beneficial for non-ergots than ergots. the main improvement of motor functions by da agonists is related to d2 agonism.
however, in monotheraphy, the selective d2-receptor da agonist sumanirole seemed less effective than  xxxd3145xxx  which
is selective for d2- like da-receptors (d2, d3 and d4). given as adjunctive to l-dopa both drugs had equal efficacy on
motor-symptoms, indicating that d2-receptor activity must be accompanied with stimulation of other da receptors for
optimizing the efficacy on motor symptoms. striatal  xxxg657xxx  loss may be more important than  xxxg656xxx  loss for
reduced response to dopaminergic treatment. d3 stimulation may also be beneficial for the non-motor symptom
depression/mood in pd and for neuron-protection. this makes d3-receptors a potential therapeutic target in pd. 5-ht1areceptor agonism and 2 adrenergic antagonism may contribute to prevention of dyskinesia. however, 5-ht-receptor
activity is also associated with side effects. 5-ht2b agonism (and possibly 5-ht1b agonism) is associated with fibrotic
reactions, and valvular heart disease (vhd). by interfering with the cyp450 system da agonists may contribute to drugdrug interactions. lack of cyp2d6 activity is also suggested as important for etiology and cns-symptoms of pd. based
on current knowledge d2-like receptor activities (preferences for the  xxxg657xxx ) seem most beneficial. 5-ht1a-receptor
agonism (prevention of dyskinesia), 5-ht2b antagonism or no 5-ht2b-receptor activity also seems beneficial.
development of da agonists containing these properties, without interfering with cyp2d6 may be beneficial.

1. introduction
parkinson’s disease (pd) is a progressive age-related
neurodegenerative disease. there will be an increase in the
number of at-risk individuals 60 years of age and older, and
therefore the prevalence of pd is likely to increase in the
coming decades [1]. nowadays it is known that pd has a
multifactorial etiology and pathology in which the substantia
nigra pars compacta (snc), together with the ventral
tegmentum, the most prominent dopaminergic nuclei in the
brain, play a prominent role [1, 2]. the degeneration of the
snc can be demonstrated by autopsy in deceased pd
patients and is generally considered as the ultimate
pathological confirmation of the diagnosis [1]. enhancing
dopamine synthesis and release following administration of
levodopa consequentially results in major therapeutic effects
on the symptoms of pd [1]. however, with progressing
neurodegeneration and longterm use of levodopa practical
problems do occur. after a certain period of time the efficacy
of levodopa decreases urging the need for higher dosages.
this in turn may go accompanied by motor fluctuations [1].
the current thought is that due to narrowing of the
therapeutic window, levodopa has to be administered more

frequently leading to more frequent, pulsatile, plasma peaks
of levodopa shooting into the levels that cause adverse
events. this experience has led to the concept of smooth less
pulsatile plasma concentrations. recently, this concept has
been developed into extended release preparations of
levodopa and continuous intestinal administration of the
drug in order to maintain stable plasma concentrations [1].
however, one should bear in mind that kinetic profiles in
blood plasma not necessarily reflect kinetic profiles in the
brain. another drawback of treatment with levodopa, despite
its undisputed therapeutic efficacy, is the availability of a
biosynthetic system that provides the bioconversion of
levodopa into dopamine [1]. moreover, a neuronal transport
system is necessary to transport both levodopa and dopamine
to the target areas for neurotransmission. these considerations have led to the development of chemical structures
that are able to bind to, and activate dopamine receptors, the
dopamine mimics, currently better known as the dopamine
agonists [1, 2]. another sensory neurological disorder in
which dopamine has been found to play a role is the
idiopathic restless legs syndrome (rls)[1, 3]. this neurological disorder gives highly effective therapeutic responses
with both levodopa and dopamine agonists [1, 3]. long-term
administration of levodopa in this pathology may lead to a
phenomenon known as augmentation characterized by
occurrence of symptoms earlier in the day and sometimes
worsening of these symptoms [3]. this augmentation is

observed in up to 72% of the rls patients treated with ldopa, it occurs with a much lower frequency in patients
using dopamine agonists [3]. despite the beneficial effects of
dopaminergic therapy in this condition, the role of dopamine
in the pathophysiology of rls is still unknown.
dopamine (da) agonists have the recent years become,
first-line treatment for pd (depending on age) [1, 2], as well
for rls [3]. pd and rls do have different pathophysiology,
show different symptomatology resulting in different dosing
and treatment-regimen.
1.1. parkinson’s disease
pd is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative
disease after alzheimer’s disease, with a prevalence of about
1 percent of the population over 60 years of age [2]. most
patients are first aware their illness through occurrence of
motor symptoms [4] as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and
postural instability [5]. pd is movements disorder with so
many multiple causative factors that a recent publication
refers to pd as “parkinson diseases” as it may present with a
plethora of different symptoms, or combinations of them like
motor symptoms, dysautonomia and non-motor symptoms
[4]. this multisystem disorder is also denoted as synuclinopathy, and can be readily differentiated from other
synuclinopathies as multiple system atrophy and hallervorden–spatz disease [5]. from screening of more than 1900
german pd patients, one demonstrated that mutations in the
-synuclein gene are rare, suggesting that other factors
contribute to the -synuclein aggregation in the majority of
the patients [6].

kvernmo et al.

its biological correlate in snc damage (stage 3), rather than
symptoms with its biological correlates in the lower
brainstem (stages 1-2).
an interesting hypothesis to explain this has recently
been published by lang [4]. he proposed that in most cases,
the degenerative process spreads like described by braak et
al. [5, 7, 8], but the initial cell loss in the other structures
than snc, is below the threshold for clinical symptoms.
this may be explained by the fact that there is a number
of underlying factors which may be activated in snc,
regardless of the cause or etiologic process, when the
degenerative process strikes it, resulting in an accelerated
loss of cells [4].
the underlying factors are several, as for example
oxidative stress with the presence of increased iron,
neuromelanin, increased daergic turnover (resulting in free
radical formation) and excitotoxic glutamatergic input [4].
according to this hypothesis, a successful disease
modifying therapy must consist of compounds, both dealing
with the specific daergic cell processes as well as the more
general degenerative processes [4]. it is thus important, not
only to identify the da agonists efficacy as da replacement
therapy, and potentially da cell-specific protection, but also
their potential effects on non-motor symptoms and/or more
general disease-modifying abilities.

the publications of braak et al. [5, 7, 8] demonstrate that
the pd pathology involves few predisposed nerve cell types,
being involved in a progressive manner. upon analysis of
125 autopsy cases, one found a continuous development of
characteristic inclusion bodies. the inclusions were present
as elongated and partly branched lewy neutrites in cellular
processes, and as globular or spherical lewy bodies in the
perykaria of involved neurons [5]. these neutrites/bodies
consist mainly of aggregations of misfolded -synuclein, a
protein most present presynaptically [5].

in the recent years, non-motor symptoms in pd such as
depression have attracted significant attention, due to
depression-prevalence of 38% among pd patients [10]. it
has been known for at least 15 years that there is a
connection between pd progression and depression [11].
starkstein and colleagues followed 105 patients for one year,
using the hoehn and yahr scale (1 to 5, 5 most severe) to
measure the disease progression. among these patients, 20%
with no depression, 41% with mild depression and 65% with
major depression had increased their score with one on the
hoehn and yahr scale during this year. statistical
significance was reached for the composite of no, - and mild
depression vs. major depression (p < 0.0001) as well as for
no depression vs. major depression (p < 0.05).

the lesions evolving during the course of the illness
begins in the medulla oblongata and olfactory bulb (stage 1
and 2), extending in a predictable manner throughout the
brain. the snc is involved later in its course (from stage 3)
[5, 7, 8], giving the above mentioned parkinsonian
symptoms due to reduced da levels in the striatum, altering
the activity of striatal output nuclei, with disinhibition of
basal ganglia output. this results in increased inhibition of
excitatory glutaminergic projections to the cortex, giving
reduced cortical motor output [9]. stage 4 involves the
anteromedial temporal mesocortex. stage 5 and 6 involves
the key neocortical areas. the declined intellectual facilities,
as well as impaired cognition in the end phase of pd, seem
to have its biological correlates in the damages of the
neocortical areas, as well as in the limbic structures [7].

a recent study [12], with a follow up on 11 years (50
controls, 90 pd patients) strongly connected comorbid nonmotor symptoms to increased mortality among these patients
[12]. when comparing pd patients with controls, the hazard
ratio for mortality was 1.64 (95% ci: 1.21-2.23). age at
onset for pd and the severity of neurological symptoms were
not independent predictors of mortality. dementia (hazard
ratio hr = 1.94, 95% ci: 1.26-2.99) and depression (hr =
2.66, 95% ci: 1.59-4.44) were independent predictors of
mortality. a recent study, prodest-pd, in 1023 patients
with idiopathic pd [13] demonstrated 9.9% of the patients to
suffer from major depressive disorder according to dsm iv
diagnostic criteria while high proportions reported
depressive symptoms on different rating scales (ham-d,
hads-d, bdi, updrs i items depression).

the validity of the braak staging [5, 7, 8] may be
challenged, as clinical experience as well as imaging studies
provides evidence both for and against [4]. most relevant for
the current treatment options is the fact that most patients
with pd first become aware of motor symptoms [4], having

the mesolimbic and mesocortical da system may be
involved in mood and behavior. d3 receptors have a high
concentration in this region, and d3 receptors may play a role
in the pathogenesis of depression [14-16].

receptor-binding and pharmacokinetic properties

based on this, one has speculated whether d3 agonists
may improve depressive symptoms [14]. da agonists d3
activity may thus also be important for treatment of the nonmotor symptoms as mood/depression/motivation.
1.2. restless legs syndrome (rls)
restless legs syndrome is defined as a sensorimotor
disorder with primary sensory symptoms of a strong, often
irresistible, urge to move the leg. it may involve one or both
legs; in advanced levels of severity of rls, the urge to move
can spread to include the arms or other parts of the body
(head, trunk). [17]. it is often described by patients as a
funny feeling in the legs, a creepy or crawly feeling in the
legs, with or without pain, and in general they find it difficult
to describe. these sensations occur when they have to sit for
a longer period of time and especially are worse at night
when they are in bed. the symptoms can hamper normal
sleep leading to prolonged sleep latency, more interruptions
of sleep and decreased sleep satisfaction. the international
restless legs study group has developed four essential
diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of rls: 1. an urge to
move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, 2. the urge to
move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during
periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting, 3. the
urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally
relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least
as long as the activity continues, 4. the urge to move or
unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than
during the day or only occur in the evening or night. [18].
supportive clinical features are: prevalence of rls among
first degree relatives of the rls patient, response to daergic
therapy (levodopa or da agonist), and the occurrence of
periodic limb movements during sleep (plms). rls has a
high prevalence in the general population and has a major
impact on quality of life [19]. the pathophysiological origin
of rls is still unclear. the daergic link has led to a number
of imaging studies especially of the nigro-striatal system.
there is no evidence of primary neurodegeneration in the
substantia nigra of patients suffering from rls. mri,
spect and pet scans have been used to measure pre- and
postsynaptic da receptor binding. no abnormalities or just
slight differences from normal controls were observed [20].
an obvious caveat is the low number of patients included in
these studies. currently more attention is being paid to the
role of central inhibition of reflexes [20]. studying soleus hreflexes in stimulus experiments in plmd/rls patients, in
comparison with normal controls, pointed to a diminished
inhibition at spinal level in plmd patients. the explanation
might be an altered function of descending spinal tracts,
peripheral influence or changes at the inter-neuronal circuitry
at spinal level, or combinations of these possibilities [21].
studying the effect of da agonist treatment on the cutaneous
silent period, a spinal reflex mediated by adelta cutaneous
afferents, in rls patients showed a change in duration that
can be considered as a clinical measure of improvement.
clemens and colleagues suggested a possible role of spinal
da dysfunction in the etiology of rls [22]. the role of a
daergic mechanism in the pathophysiology is strongly
supported by the high efficacy of daergic substances in the
treatment of rls [23, 24]. substantia nigra echogenicity as
measured by transcranial sonography (tcs) correlates with

current topics in medicinal chemistry, 2008, vol. 8, no. 12

the sn iron content, and sn echogenicity is shown to be
significantly decreased in rls patients (n=49) compared to
healthy controls (n=49, p< 0.001) [25]. this was suggested
to be a biological marker for the brain iron homeostasis in
rls [25]. moreover, brain iron and particularly iron in the
sn is reduced in rls [26].
in vitro and in vivo studies [26] indicate that iron
defiency reduces striatal d2 receptors and da transporters,
and increases striatal extracellular da, enhancing the
amplitude of the normal circadian pattern. increased
extracellular da is believed to result from either increased
da production, decreased uptake of da or both [26]. as
tyrosine hyd-roxylase, particularly in its phosphorylated
form, is also increased with iron chelation of pc12 cells, this
was at least partly suggested to be a result of increased
 xxxg2276xxx  activity [26]. furthermore, the iron
defiency was also suggested to create abnormalities in other
neuro-transmitter/ neuromodulator systems such as the
opioid, glutamate, histamine, and adenosine, which may also
produce some of the rls symptoms [26].
1.3. molecular structures, “classes” and “subclasses” of
da-agonists
the present marketed oral da-agonists may be divided
into 2 classes; the ergots and the non-ergot da agonists [27].
as a main conclusion, the 2 classes do not differ
significantly with respect to efficacy on motor symptoms in
pd, but due to the receptor-profiles, the non-ergots have a
more beneficial side effect profile (table 1).
except from bromocriptine (ergotaman-3',6',18-trione, 2bromo-12'-hydroxy-2'-(1-methylethyl)-5'alpha-(2-methylpropyl)-), the ergots may be further divided into 2-subgroups, 8-aminoergolines as  xxxd2498xxx  (urea, n'-((8alpha)9,10-didehydro-6-methylergolin-8-yl)-n,n-diethyl-)
and
terguride (urea, n,n-diethyl-n'-((8-alpha)-6-methylergolin8-yl)-), and 8-aminoergolines as cabergoline (ergoline-8carboxamide,
n-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-n-((ethylamino)carbonyl)-6-(2-propenyl)-, (8-beta)- )) and pergolide
(ergoline, 8-((methylthio)methyl)-6-propyl-, (8beta)-). all
the ergots on the market are orally administrated.
the non-ergots pramipexole ((s)-2-amino-4,5,6,7tetrahydro-6-(propylamino) xxxd304xxx ), piribedil (2-(4piperonyl-1-piperazinyl)pyrimidine) and  xxxd3145xxx  (4-(2(dipropylamino)ethyl)-1,3-dihydro-2h-indol-2-one) are all
orally administered, while the more recent introduced nonergoline
 xxxd3148xxx 
((6s)-6-(propyl(2-(2-thienyl)ethyl)
amino)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1- naphthalenol), is administered
as a patch.
structurally, apomorphine (4h-dibenzo(de,g)quinoline10,11-diol, 5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-6-methyl-, (r)- (9ci)) which
is a derivative of the opioid morphine can be classified as an
aporphine [28]. apomorphine was the first antiparkinsonian
drug to be administered subcutaneously, and is used as
adjunctive to l-dopa, or as “rescue” therapy [28]. apomorphine has a short acting agonist action at d1 and d2 receptors
[28].
even though the non-ergots pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx 
seem to have relatively similar molecular-structures, and
both are highly selective for d2 type da-receptors over d1

receptor-binding and pharmacokinetic properties

type da-receptors (table 2), they have different metabolic
pathways [27,28] as well as possible different efficacy
profiles [27].  xxxd3148xxx , differs from pramipexole and
 xxxd3145xxx  with respect to molecular structure, as well as in
the da-receptor profile (table 1) [29].
2. receptor profiles
2.1. binding affinities to different receptors
motor side effects may both be caused by the disease
progression itself due to alterations in da receptor
expression, and/or adaptive responses to drug treatment [9].
as previously assessed (table 1) by hurley and jenner [9],
there are differences between the concentrations and
distribution of da-subreceptors within the brain. there are
however, as earlier pointed out [9] not meaningful to target
receptor-populations within a specific brain region as the
drugs are systemically administered. it is thus of interest to
describe and discuss the da agonists according to their
receptor profiles, and the known clinical output.
table 1 shows the different da agonists binding affinities to daergic and serotonergic receptors, whose stimulation seems to be involved in the most pronounced
therapeutic effects as well as adverse events with the da
agonists. [27, 30, 31] the general pattern to be seen is the
higher selectivity of the non-ergots pramipexole and
 xxxd3145xxx  than the ergots.
this selectivity is seen between different receptor
families (daergic vs serotonergic) and betweeen daergicreceptor sub-families (d1 vs. d2 sub-family), with the nonergots (pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx ) showing low affinity for
both serotonergic receptors, and for daergic d1-like
receptors.
furthermore, there are also affinity differences between
pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx , with pramipexole more selective
for the d3 subtype receptors within the d2 sub-family, than
 xxxd3145xxx . the non-ergot  xxxd3148xxx , shows low selectivity
among the da receptors d1, d2, d3, d4 and d5, also
indicating low selectivity for daergic-receptor sub-families.
with the exception of  xxxg658xxx ,  xxxd3148xxx  exhibits a
binding profile towards da receptors similar to that of da,
with a 30-fold higher affinity for the receptors than da [29].
this means that the selectivity d2/d1, d3/d2 as well as d5/d 2
are similar to that of da (table 1). apomorphine has a d 1
selectivity, which numerically is between l-dopa and
 xxxd3148xxx  on one hand, and that of the ergots on the other,
and in general about 25 times less selective for the d1
compared to the d2 sub-family (table 1).
2.2. clinical relevant side effects of da-agonists and
proposed mechanism of action
dyskinesia is considered as a motor complication during
pd treatment, typically less prevalent in da mono-therapy/
da + l-dopa compared to l-dopa mono-therapy [32, 33]. in
the overall pd population, drug induced dyskinesias in
general are not the major determinant of quality of life (qol)
[34]. however, in patients with advanced stages of pd,
dyskinesias are associated with poorer qol [34].
it is suggested that there are different mechanisms for
different dyskinesias, meaning that l-dopa and da induced

1053

dyskinesias not necessarily have the same mechanism of
action, being an important knowledge as l-dopa induced
dyskinesias is one of the most challenging problems in pd
treatment [34]. it might be interesting to consider a direct
stimulating effect of l-dopa on da receptors [35]. increased
dyskinesias with higher dosages of l-dopa in advanced pd
can be lowered by decreasing the dosage of l-dopa. in
current thinking l-dopa will exert an anti-parkinsonian
activity after conversion to da. however, with advancing
stage of pd also neurodegeneration increases thus lowering
the da synthesizing capacity of the neurons needed for the
conversion of l-dopa. the amount of l-dopa in brain
increases but is not accompanied by higher concentrations of
da [36]. this underlines a possible role for l-dopa as
neurotransmitter under these circumstances.
the occurrence of dyskinesia in pd-patients receiving
anti-pd medications has been related to d1 affinity [37] and
d1 agonist properties [27].
d1-receptor stimulation has been shown to induce more
than 30 genes, were the level of several of these genes (such
as c-fos, fosb, c-jun and zif268/egrl have been correlated to
motor complications of treatment with l-dopa and da
agonists [9].
this was shown by a meta-analysis (n=1071) where
bromocriptine treated patients (d1 antagonist, ki = 1627 nm,
table 1), experienced significant less dyskinesias than those
treated with the  xxxg655xxx  agonist cabergoline (or = 1,57,
p = 0.03) [38]. pergolide, with similar d1 affinity (ki = 180
nm, table 1) as cabergoline (ki = 200 nm, table 1), is not
studied head to head against l-dopa on l-dopa naive
patients where one could add “rescue” l-dopa to any of the
treatment groups. in the pelmopet study (n= 294 danaive patients with early pd, prospective, randomized,
double-blind) [39], the ergot da pergolide and l-dopa was
compared. this comparison showed that 16.3% and 32.9%
in the pergolide and the l-dopa group, respectively, had
dyskinesia. the hr for developing dyskinesia for patients in
the pergolide group versus the l-dopa group was 0.48 (95%
ci, 0.29–0.80) [39].
upon a very recent retrospective analysis of the calmpd study (double-blind, n= 301, l-dopa vs. pramipexole,
supplemental l-dopa allowed), comparing the non-ergot da
pramipexole monotherapy group (n = 44) with the l-dopa
group (n = 150), 4.5% and 54% experienced “involuntary
movements”, respectively [40]. from these values, we
calculated a hr = 0.08 for developing dyskinesia in the
pramipexole versus the l-dopa group. a comparison of these
results with the pelmopet study is indicative of a
significantly less probability of developing dyskinesia with
pramipexole than with pergolide. one weakness with this
retrospective analysis of the calm-pd study in comparison
with the pelmopet study, is that one may assume that the
pramipexole patients not receiving supplemental (or rescue)
l-dopa have a less severe and/or a slower progressing
disease. on the other hand, pelmopet had duration of
three years, while calm-pd lasted for four years, may be
accumulating the risk of dyskinesia in the latter case as a
result of the disease itself.

this relation is further supported by the fact that the nonergots pramipexole (ki, d1 > 10000 nm) and  xxxd3145xxx  (ki,
d1 = 32500 nm), are associated with lower risk of dyskinesias than the ergot cabergoline [27, 41]. the non-ergots
pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx  bind mainly to the da receptors
d2 and d3. more indirect evidence for the relation between
d1 affinity and dyskinesia, is the comparison of placebo,
 xxxd3145xxx  and the highly selective  xxxg656xxx  agonist
sumanirole, with negligible activity at, d1, d3 and d4 da
receptors [42]. the agonists were added to l-dopa, and the
patients were in principle not allowed to deviate from the
initial l-dopa dose. this study demonstrated that these
agonists were similar with respect to motor efficacy and side
effects, including the relatively low rate of dyskinesia [42].
recently it has pointed out that therapies stimulating both
d1-like and d2-like receptors maximize the development of
l-dopa induced dyskinesias (lid), probably by simultaneous stimulation of both the indirect (d2 receptors), - and
the direct (d1 receptors) pathway [34]. this is in accordance
with the observation that 24% of patients treated with apomorphine developed or experienced worsening of dyskinesia
[43]. except from  xxxd3148xxx , apomorphine is the da with
the lowest d2/d1 ratio (table 1).
based on in vitro and animal models [44], the potential
for d1 agonist both exerting neuroprotective as well as
neurotoxic action, have been reviewed and discussed [44].
the catecholamine moiety of da and l-dopa are autooxidized, leading to free radical cascades and/or covalent modifications of cellular proteins [44]. it has been suggested that
accumulation of -synuclein protofibrils causes pd, while
fibrils are inert, or may be protective [45].
when using library screening for identifying molecules
might attenuate -synuclein fibrillation, all but one of 15
identified fibril inhibitors were catecholamines structurally
related to da [45], among them both da and l-dopa, in
addition to norepinephrine and epinephrine. these molecules
were inhibiting the protofibril to fibril conversion, causing
accumulation of the -synuclein protofibril, described as a
potential mechanism of associated -synuclein neurotoxicity
[45]. adding antioxidants reversed inhibitory activity of da
and l-dopa, suggesting catechol oxidation being responsible
for the observed inhibition [45]. as known full d1-agonists
are catecholamines [44], this may be an issue for development of drugs exerting this action.

from experiments in mice, sealfon and olanow [46]
have concluded that d5-receptor activation inhibits locomotor behavior [46].
it seems that several pathways within the basal ganglia
contribute to the expression of lid, with overactivity of the
direct striatal output pathway being a core component of its
pathophysiology [34]. the activity of this pathway is
regulated by several neurotransmitters and abnormalities in
several of these results in overactivity and dyskinetic
symptoms [34]. several classes of glutamate receptors are
involved in a complex abnormal transmission, including
alterations of the phosphorylation status of the glutamate
receptors [34]. the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor
antagonist amantadine (tricyclo(3.3.1.1(sup 3,7))decan-1amine) (fig. (1) has shown antidyskinetic effect in mptp
treated primates, as well as in phase ii studies [34]. this
clearly links the direct striatal output pathway and glutamate
and its receptors to the pathophysiology of lid.
other non-daergic transmitter systems than glutamate
are involved in lid through influences on the direct striatal
output pathway, but the mechanisms by which these are
involved in lid, are not fully elucidated yet [34].
fabbrini et al. [34] described the status of dyskinesia
research, and among successful approaches to reduce lid
(shown in clinical studies), comprise of d-2 like agonists, 2
adrenergic antagonists, 5-ht1a agonists, 5-ht2a/2c antagonists, nmda-receptor antagonists, histamine h3 agonists
and cannabinoid cb1 agonists and antagonists. in addition,
the d3 partial agonist bp 897 (2-naphthalenecarboxamide,
n-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)butyl)-,
monohydrochloride) reduces lid in non-humane primate studies.
d1 and nmda receptors are juxtaposed on dendrites of
striatal neurons, and are functionally linked through their
second messenger system. thus, activation of either of these
receptors may modify the function of the other [9], and
makes nmda-receptor antagonism a possible therapeutic
target to prevent and/or treat dyskinesia, documented in nonhuman primates and in a phase ii study, respectively [34].
2 adrenergic -2a and 2c receptors are distributed
widely within the basal ganglia, including in sn [47], in
mptp-treated primates, two 2 adrenergic antagonists
idazoxan ((+-)-2-(1,4-benzodioxan-2-yl)-2-imidazoline) and
fipamezole

imidazole) are shown to reduce lid and extend the duration
of l-dopa action [47]. the 2 adrenergic antagonists and
antidepressant
mirtazapine
(pyrazino(2,1-a) xxxd3047xxx (2,3c)(2)benzazepine, 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro- 2-methyl-) is
shown to reduce lid in pd patients [47], thus supporting
this mechanism of action. interestingly, 2 adrenergic antagonists do not reduce dyskinesia elicited by apomorphine
[34], indicative of dyskinesia having several mechanisms of
actions, and in this case, probably through d1 stimulation.
furthermore, this must also be indicative of the importance
of separating da agonists and l-dopa when discussing their
treatment-principles, in this case with respect to adverse
events. pergolide being an agonist for the 3 2 adrenergic

receptors studied (table 1), differs significantly from all
other da agonists in this respect, mostly being antagonists
or inactive on these receptors (table 1). this may be in
accordance with our indirect comparison with pramipexole,
indicating a clinical significant higher incidence of
dyskinesia with pergolide, also supporting stimulation of 2
adrenergic receptors being causative for dyskinesias.
the serotonergic system has in general been shown to be
affected in pd, irrespective of the presence of depression.
loss of 5-ht neurons and lewy bodies has been reported in
the raphe nuclei [48]. furthermore, 5-ht concentrations as
well as bmax of the 5-ht reuptake site were lower in the
striatum and neocortex [48].

bmax of the  xxxg1108xxx  has been shown to be
elevated in both frontal and temporal cortex compared to
control. however, in pd with dementia, and in dementia
with lewy bodies, the bmax in the frontal cortex was lower
and higher than control, respectively [48]. while the 5-ht1areceptor partial agonist buspirone prevented expression of
established dyskinesia in placebo-controlled phase ii studies,
the agonist sarizotan ((-)-3-((((r)-2-chromanylmethyl)
amino)methyl)-5-(p-fluorophenyl)pyridine)
demonstrated
this antidyskinetic activity in an open label phase ii study,
but not in two double blind placebo controlled studies [34].
nevertheless despite the promising findings, last year (2007)
merck kgaa decided to stop further development of its latestage development drug sarizotan as a treatment for pd. the
company made the decision after examining the results of
two phase iii studies of sarizotan in advanced pd patients
suffering from dyskinesia. a statement from merck said that
the phase iii studies did not confirm earlier phase ii findings
or the results from preclinical studies. the two trials,
paddy 1 and paddy 2, investigated twice-daily dosing of
sarizotan 1mg tablets to investigate whether the drug could
achieve a 25% improvement in dyskinesia symptoms, but it
failed to meet this efficacy threshold.

in the mesolimbic reward-system of these patients [54].
furthermore, by checking polymorphism at 31 genes
involved in the neurotransmitters da, serotonin, norepinephrine and gaba, one concluded that da, serotonin and
norepinephrine genes contribute approximately equally to
the risk for pg. among the da receptors, the d2 and d 4
polymorphism was the most significant [31].

as in the case of the  xxxg1108xxx , bmax of the 5-ht2a
receptor has been shown to be elevated in both frontal and
temporal cortex compared to control [48]. the 5-ht2a/2c
antagonist quetiapine (ethanol, 2-(2-(4-dibenzo(b,f)(1,4)
thiazepin-11-yl-1-piperazinyl)ethoxy)-) was effective in
preclinical but not in clinical studies, while the antagonist
clozapine reduced the severity of lid in a randomized
double blind, parallel group placebo-controlled study [34].

valvular heart disease (vhd) and pulmonary and
retroperioteneal fibrosis seen with (in particular) long term
use, appear to represent a class effect of 8-aminoergolines
as cabergoline and pergolide [27]. this is further confirmed
in a very recent meta-analysis [56]. these fibrotic reactions
are most probably mediated by  xxxg1114xxx  stimulation
[27, 60], and are to some extent related to cumulative dose
[27, 56]. cabergoline (ki = 1.2 nm) and pergolide (ki = 7.1)
are demonstrated to have a high affinity to the 5-ht2b
receptors [27], also being agonists [57], while bromocriptine,
both have a lower affinity (ki = 56.2) to this receptor, as
well as being a partial agonist [57], only having one vhd
report [27], but several hundred reports on other fibrotic
syndromes [58].

the histamine h3 agonists immepip (piperidine, 4-(1himidazol-4-ylmethyl)-) and imetit (carbamimidothioic acid,
2-(1h-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl ester) are shown in the nonhuman
primate to be efficacious antidyskinetic agents by preventing
expression of established dyskinesia [34]. interestingly, both
cannabinoid cb agonists and antagonists are shown to
prevent expression of established dyskinesia. in the first
case, nabilone (9h-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-9-one, 3-(1,1dimethylheptyl)-6,6a,7,8,10,10a-hexahydro-1-hydroxy-6,6dimethyl-, (6ar,10ar)-rel-) is shown to reduce lid in
nonhumane primates, as well as in a double blind placebocontrolled phase iia study. both the antagonist rimonabant
( xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxamide,
5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-n-1-piperidinyl-) as well as ave
1625
(1-[bis-(4-chloro-phenyl)-methyl]-3-[(3,5-difluorophenyl)-methanesulfonyl-methylene]-azetidine)
demonstrated antidyskinetic efficacy in mptp primates, but
rimonabant was ineffective in a small double-blind, placebocontrolled phase iia study [34].
recently, obsessive adverse events as pathological
gambling have been reported during da treatment, which
have been linked to daergic treatments, and thus stimulation
of da-receptors [49-52]. however, hypersexuality as an
adverse effect after treatment with l-dopa, ergot-da
agonists or selgiline was reported already in 1989 [53]. one
of these articles suggested d3 stimulation as causative for
pathological gambling (pg), as d3 receptors are mainly
localized in the limbic areas of the brain [49]. on the other
hand, studies of pg patients using fmr shows hypofunction

sudden onset sleep has also been reported as a side effect
upon l-dopa and da treatment, but with pd duration, nonmotor pd symptoms as vivid dreams and hallucinations as
well as high score on epworth sleepiness scale also being
characteristics of these patients [55].
there is no significant difference in the incidence of
sleep attacks when comparing the da agonists [55], but the
risk is higher with da agonists compared to l-dopa (rr=
2.9 vs. 1.9, n=2952). all the da agonists studied have a d4
affinity within the same order of magnitude (table 1) [55],
and all except from bromocriptine being agonists, supporting
a possible role of d4 polymorphism as a risk factor for sleep
attacks [30], which also supports the finding of no
differences between the da agonists with respect the
incidence of sleep attacks.

interestingly,  xxxd2498xxx  with its high affinity to the 5-ht2b
receptor (ki = 1.3 nm) [27], but being an antagonist [57],
does have significantly less reports on fibrotic syndromes
than bromocriptine (7 vs 272) [58]. a systematic search in
the existing adverse drug reaction databases, as well as in the
manufacturers own databases (covering 365000 patient
years), no reports on cardiac valvulopathy was found [59].
although  xxxd3145xxx  does have a few reports on fibrotic
syndromes [58], the meta analysis performed by simonis et
al. [56], shows that moderate to severe valvular heart
changes in the non-ergot group (consisting of pramipexole
and  xxxd3145xxx ) was equal to the control-group, both being
10%) this is in accordance with the  xxxg1114xxx  stimulation suggested to be causative for the fibrotic reactions, as
these non-ergot da agonists have very low affinities for the
 xxxg1114xxx , with ki > 10000 nm and ki = 3800 for
pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx , respectively (table 1).
these valvular changes were observed in 26% of the
patients treated with the 8 -aminoergolines cabergoline and
pergolide [56]. the incidence of severe valvulopathy is
estimated to be less than 1% [56], but according to the casereports evaluated in detail, it is evident that the fibrotic

reactions not necessarily are reversible, or only party
reversible upon cessation of the drug [27].
the 5-ht2b activation of cultured interstitial human
cardiac cells is shown to induce mitogenesis [60]. roth [60]
suggested that valvulopathy induced by these receptors, is
caused by the inappropriate mitogenic stimulation of
normally quiescent valve cells. this results in an overgrowth
valvulopathy, with several possible molecular mechanisms
[60]:
one of these molecular mechanisms is 5-ht2b activation
leading to the dissociation of the heterotrimeric g-protein,
with the gq subunit activating phospholipase c-  (plc). this is followed by the activation of protein kinase and
the liberation of diaglycerol.
src (a  xxxg2198xxx ) phosphorylation and activation, as
well as the activation of the pathways of extracellular
regulated kinases (erk’s) may be induced by g-proteins.
furthermore, src-p may enhance the activity of tgf-
receptor, with augmentation of 5-ht2b-stimulated mitogenesis being the result [60]. many g-protein coupled
receptors (as 5-ht2b) may facilitate activation of  xxxg1369xxx  and
 xxxg1366xxx  upon -arrestin binding [60].
phosphorylation of restinobloma protein is also a result
of 5-ht2b activation, and like the three other mechanism
mentioned above, leading to mitosis, and possibly an
overgrowth valvulopathy as the result [60].
one should also be aware of the potential for modified
receptor internalization upon coexpression of 5-ht1b and 5ht2b receptors. it was demonstrated that serotonin- induced
internalization of 5-ht2b receptors was accelerated 5–fold,
and was insensitive to the  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist rs
127445 (2-amino-4-(4-uoronapthyl-1-yl)-6-isopropylpyrimidine) [61].
the daily dose for rls treatment (pramipexole and
 xxxd3145xxx ) is typically around 10-20% that of pd treatment,
this low doses is probably reflected in the side effect-profile,
with nausea being the most prevalent one [23, 24].
2.3. clinical efficacy of da agonists and proposed
mechanism of action
despite the potential limitation and issues connected to
full d1 agonists, there is also pointed out several potential
benefits within neuroprotection and antiparkinsonian activity
[44]. the first bioavailable full  xxxg655xxx  agonist,
dihydrexidine (fig. 1) (benzo(a)phenanthridine-10,11-diol,
5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydro- (6ar,12bs)-rel-) (dhx) did
produce profound antiparkinson activity in the mptp-treated
monkey [44]. even though similar results have been
obtained with other full  xxxg655xxx  agonists, including a86929 (fig. 1) (benzo(f)thieno(2,3-c)quinoline-9,10-diol,
4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-, hydrochloride, (5ar,
11bs)-rel-) (given as the prodrug abt-431), chemically
related to dhx, no such agonists are available for clinical
use [44]. however, development of such agonists gave
compounds with poor oral bioavailability and rapid tolerance
development [44].

growth factor, are inhibited by da, and the d1 agonists
skf38393 (±-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1h)-3-benzazepine-7,8,-diol hydrochloride) and ym435 (7,8-isoquinolinediol, 4-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,2,3-tetrahydro-, hydrochloride, (s)-). this effect was blocked by the d1 antagonist
sch23390 ((r)-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5phenyl-1h-benzazepine-7-ol) [44]. as this suggested that
d1-receptors also play a role in the disease state of
atherosclerosis, this effect was suggested being important for
the ability of d1 agonists to increase neuronal growth in
brain [44]. this hypothesis has not been tested yet.
the motor-benefits of the da agonists have previously
been linked to  xxxg656xxx  stimulation, as it seems that areas
rich in these receptors (caudate and putamen) are involved in
motor control [14, 27]. at least the short term importance of
d2 stimulation is shown in a recent study with the highly
selective  xxxg656xxx  agonist sumanirole ((r)-5,6-dihydro-5(methylamino)-4h-imidazo(4,5,1-ij)quinolin-2(1h)-one)
which was shown to be as effective as  xxxd3145xxx  when added
to l-dopa, with a mean follow up for 281 days [42]. used in
monotherapy however, it seemed that sumanirole ( xxxg656xxx  activity only) was less effective than  xxxd3145xxx 
(activity on all d2-like receptors) with respect to improvement on motor symptoms [62]. due to a lack of clinically
meaningful improvement in efficacy and/or safety over
currently available da agonists, pfizer ceased further
development of sumanirole for the treatment of pd in july
2004 [62].
d2 stimulation is also shown to exert potential neuroprotective effects preventing apoptosis through phosphoinotiside 3-kinase activation [63]. da agonists (in this case
pramipexole) is shown to reduce da synthesis, release and
metabolism via activation of the presynaptic d2 autoreceptors, resulting in decreased free radical production, and
lower risk of oxidative damage [64, 65]. excess glutamate
release, may induce exitotoxic damage in targets of the
subthalamic nucleus [64], which may be modulated by da
agonists, as d2-type agonists have been shown to protect
mesencephalic neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity [66].
striatal  xxxg657xxx  loss may play a greater role than d2
receptor loss when looking at reduction of response to
daergic treatment [67, 27].
these reductions in d3 levels, particularly in putamen
and nucleus accumbens (40-50%) were observed in patient
with a pd diagnosis for more than 10 years [68].
furthermore, it was shown that the d2 and the d3 receptors
are independently changed within pd [68], resulting in
decreased  xxxg657xxx  levels, and increased  xxxg656xxx 
levels, respectively, compared with control.
the interpretation of these observations was that d3
stimulation by anti-pd drugs could be considered a therapeutic target (striatum) in pd-treatment [27, 67, 68].
it has been suggested that d3 receptors in the mesolimbic
pathway may be involved in behavior and mood [14]. this
might provide an explanation to the antidepressive and
antianhedonic effect seen with certain d3 selective cns
drugs [14, 69].
this is further supported by findings on reduced mesocortical and mesolimbic functions in pd patients by ouchi et

receptor-binding and pharmacokinetic properties

al. [70] and by loss of da and noradrenaline innervation in
the limbic system as reported by remy et al. [71]. the
purported antidepressant effect of pramipexole has been
demonstrated by reversal of stress-induced anhedonia in the
rat [72]. there is growing evidence for the d3 selective da
pramipexole's effect on major depression [73] and bipolar
depression [74, 75] in patients without pd, or depression in
patients with rls [76, 77], as well as on depression in
patients with pd [78-80]. corrigan et al. [73] compared
pramipexole (n = 104) with fluoxetine (n = 35) in patients
with major depression in a 8-week randomized, placebo (n =
35) controlled double-blind study, pramipexole in dosages
up to 5 mg daily showed positive effects on the ham-d and
madrs rating scales, being significantly better than
placebo (pramipexole 1 mg) and similar to fluoxetine.
goldberg et al. [74] studied the effect of pramipexole for 6
weeks when added to mood stabilizers in patients suffering
from treatment-resistant bipolar depression; 67% of the
patients on pramipexole vs. 20% of the patients on placebo
(p= 0.04, n =22) had an improvement of at least 50% in their
ham-d rating scale scores. zarate et al. [75] reported the
additional therapeutic effect of pramipexole in patients with
bipolar ii depression (- 47.1% vs. - 12.4% on madras for
placebo, p < 0.05) when added to mood stabilizers (6 weeks,
n = 21). cassano and colleagues [81] studied the effect of
pramipexole in patients with a treatment resistant major
depressive episode for 28 weeks. pramipexole was given as
add-on to current antidepressant therapy (n = 23) and
showed remission in 60.9% of the patients [81].
in patients with pd and major depression according to
dsm iv, barone et al. [82] demonstrated in an open
randomized comparison of pramipexole and sertraline that
both medications gave an improvement in ham-d score (14
weeks, n = 67). the effect of pramipexole on depression
was independent from the motor improvement (updrs iii).
rektorova et al. [79] studied the effects of pramipexole and
pergolide in pd patients for 8 months (n = 41). the
antidepressant effects were measured by blinded independent
observer in an open-label condition. a significant improvement was found for pramipexole with the madrs rating
scale. both pramipexole and pergolide showed significant
improvements with the zung rating scale. based on these
results the authors concluded that they had demonstrated an
antidepressant effect of pramipexole in pd, while they could
not make any conclusion for pergolide [79] which has a less
selective d3 profile (table 1). comparable improvements
were found for both drugs on motor symptoms. moeller et
al. [80] studied pramipexole versus placebo in a doubleblind study for 32 weeks. besides improvement in motor
functions and activities of daily life, significant improvements were found for the depression and motivation items
of updrs i (n = 176). lemke et al. [78] studied the effects
of pramipexole on depression, anhedonia and motor functioning in patients with pd (9 weeks, n = 657). frequency of
depression, anhedonia as well as motor function was
significantly improved during treatment with pramipexole
[78].
in an open trial on non-pd patients with treatment
resistant depression, the less d3 selective da  xxxd3145xxx  (n =
10, mean dose 1.33 mg/day) was added to tricyclic
antidepressants or to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

(ssris). after 16 weeks 4 patients were considered to be
responders. the mean reduction on both madrs and cgi
was significant (p< 0.02) [83]. in a recent study double
blind, placebo controlled study, adding  xxxd847xxx  (once
daily formuation) to l-dopa (n = 393, 24 weeks, mean
 xxxd3145xxx  dose 18.8 mg/day), where becks depression
inventory ii (bdi-ii) was among the scales used, there were
a small (13.2%) reduction for  xxxd3145xxx , significantly better
than that of placebo (3.1 %, p = 0.0130) [84]. in a 12 weeks
double-blind rls study (mean dose = 2.15 mg/day),
 xxxd3145xxx  was shown to improve both anxiety (hadsanxiety population = 136, p=0.0385) and mood (profile of
mood states (poms) n= 380, p=0.038) [85].
among several potential neuroprotective abilities
described for the da agonists, one is mediated through d3
receptors. both pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx  were shown to
up regulate brain-derived as well as glia cell derived growth
factors, thus having a neurotrophic effect [47].
most of the potential neuroprotective effects of the da
agonists, however, are mediated through alternative
mechanisms than d2 and/or d3-receptor stimulation. one
example is pramipexole which exert protective effects in
mpp+ or rotenone exposed cells devoid of da receptors
[47]. furthermore, blockade of da receptors in daergic cell
cultures does not prevent the protective properties of
pramipexole. in addition, the enantiomers of apomorphine
and pramipexole not binding to da receptors, protects
daergic neurons from mpp+, h2o2 or 6-ohda toxicity
[47]. the antioxidant mechanisms described, including
protecting against free radical generating systems, is
predominantly seen at high da concentrations, and are thus
questioning the clinical relevance [47].
a recent review, addressing the potential neuroprotective
effects of da agonists, assesses 7 different antioxidant
effects of da agonists (levels of: hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals,  xxxd2738xxx  radicals, in addition to superoxide
dismuates activity, catalase activity, lipid peroxidation and
 xxxd2213xxx  content).  xxxd3145xxx  was shown to have a
positive effect on six of these effects [64]. the other four da
agonists assessed (bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide and
pramipexole), had at least documented impact on three of
these effects [64]. some of these effects are probably direct
interactions as they may act as free radical scavengers, due to
the hydroxylated benzyl ring structures shared by several da
agonists [64].
potential neuroprotection in the clinic is addressed in 2
studies, using two different imaging techniques, studying
pramipexole [86], and  xxxd3145xxx  [87], respectively.
the calm-pd study compared the rates of da neuron
degeneration after initial treatment with pramipexole or
levodopa in early pd by  xxxg2149xxx  imaging. the
technique used was single-photon emission computed
tomography (spect) with 2carboxymethoxy-3  (4iodophenyl)tropane (-cit) labeled with iodine 123. the
primary outcome variables was percent (%) change from
basline in striatal [123i]cit uptake after 46 months. loss
in this uptake was significantly reduced in the pramipexole
group (16%) vs. the l-dopa group (25.5%) (p = 0.01). it was
concluded, that patients initially treated with pramipexole

1060 current topics in medicinal chemistry, 2008, vol. 8, no. 12

had a reduction in loss of striatal uptake, a marker of da
neuron degeneration, compared to patients initially treated
with l-dopa [86].
the real-pet study compared the rates of loss of daterminal function in de novo patients with clinical and 18fdopa positron emission tomography (pet) evidence of early
pd, after initial treatment with  xxxd3145xxx  or l-dopa. the
primary outcome measure was reduction in putamen 18fdopa uptake (ki) between baseline and 2-year pet. the ki
decrease for  xxxd3145xxx  and l-dopa were 14,1% and 22,9%
(95% ci, 4.24-13.3), respectively, with the  xxxd3145xxx 
decrease significantly lower than the one of l-dopa
(p<0.001). the authors concluded that  xxxd3145xxx  is
associated with slower progression of pd than l-dopa as
assessed by 18f-dopa pet [87].
it has however, been proposed that the differences
between l-dopa and the agonists in these studies (calmpd and real-pet) are due to pharmacological differences
in the capacity of these drugs to regulate the  xxxg2149xxx 
or f-dopa metabolism [47]. to address the short term effect
of l-dopa and pramipexole on [123i]cit and spect
imaging, one have initiated the inspect study [88]. there
are published preliminary data were the patients underwent a
baseline scan, followed by randomization to 12 weeks of
treatment with l-dopa (600 mg, n = 31), pramipexole (n =
31, 3.0 mg) or no treatment (n = 30). a new scan was
performed after these 12 weeks, followed by an 8 week
withdrawal from the treatment and a new scan [88]. the
percent change in the [123i]cit uptake after 12 weeks
were for l–dopa, pramipexole and no treatment, 1.22 %, 2.03 % and -1.53 %, respectively. furthermore, there were
no significant changes in the scans at baseline and week 20
[88].
the non-ergot da agonists pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx 
are in clinical studies both shown significantly improve
rls-symptoms, measured by several scales [23, 24]. even
though there also are performed clinical studies with other
da agonists [24], the total body of evidence including
extensive use of different da agonists with different
receptor-profiles is far less than in the case of pd. based on
this and section 1.3, one must conclude there are more
uncertainties connected to mechanism of action, receptor and
brain compartment involvement than in the case of pd.
3. drug interaction
3.1. cyp450 interactions
most of the da agonists are metabolized by this system,
and/or may inhibit some of these enzymes [27, 28]. as
assessed by table 3, these interactions may result in drug
failure (of the da and/or the interacting drug), or increased
intensity and/or an increased number of side effects (of the
da and/or the interacting drug).
as pd patients may develop non motor symptoms as
psychosis and antipsychotic medication as clozapine may be
necessary [89]. several antipsychotic drugs are metabolized
by the isoenzyme cyp2d6, and probably also some
clozapine metabolits result from cyp2d6 metabolism [90].
concomitant medication with strong 2d6 inhibitors (as

kvernmo et al.

paroxetine) is shown to increase both plasma levels and cns
side effects of antipsychotic drugs [90].
cyp2d6 deficiency is associated with increased risk of
developing pd [91-95], and it has previously been pointed
out that pd medication being strong cyp2d6 inhibitors
(turning the patients into poor metabolizers), may be
counterproductive [27]. a recent review pointed out that null
cyp2d6 activity in healthy volunteers is associated with
personality characteristics of social cognitive anxiety, which
may bear some resemblance to milder forms of psychoticlike symptoms [90]. the cyp2d6 protein is in particular
located in the cortex and hippocampus, and it was pointed
out a relation between cyp2d6 polymorphism and the
activity of 5-ht and da. there are evidences for that
cyp2d6 poor metabolizers (pms) have lower 5-ht levels,
but a higher da tone in the pituitary [90]. this hypothesis
may be explained by pms decreased potential for inhibiting
da release in daergic pathways, for example by stimulation
of the 5-ht2a-receptors [90]. in brain tissues, cyp2d6 may
also be involved in metabolism and/or synthesis of
progesterone and its derivatives [90].
as previously described [27], there are two mechanisms
which may give drug failure:
several cyp450 isoenzymes are necessary for the
activation of prodrugs [96], where one classical example is
the transformation of codeine (metylmorphine) to morphine.
the necessary o-demethylation is mediated through the
cyp450 isoenzyme cyp2d6. it is shown that poor 2d6
metabolizers, as well as patients receiving the strong
cyp2d6 inhibitor quinidine (ki = 0.03 mum, [97]),
experience a reduced analgesic effect [96].
although not studied in-vivo, it reasonable to believe that
the da agonists pergolide (ic50 = 0.08 mum) and  xxxd3145xxx 
(ic50 = 0.54 mum) do have a potential for inhibiting activation
of prodrugs through cyp2d6 [27]. another mechanism of
action, having the potential for drug failure, is induction of
cyp450 isoenzymes. cyp1a2 and cyp3a4, two of the
enzymes involved in the metabolism of one or more da
agonists are inducible. even though this not is studied
specifically with the da agonists, there are several clinical
studies addressing this issue, clearly demonstrating induction
of cyp1a2 and/or cyp3a4 may give a decrease in the
plasma level, with drug failure as the clinical consequence
[27].
r- and s-verapamil was decreased by 78% and 80%,
respectively (in 8 males, p <.0001) upon repeated administration of st. john’s wort (sjw) [98]. sjw is shown to be an
inducer of cyp3a4 as well as of cyp1a2 (probably in
women only) [99]. imatinib, predominantly metabolized by
cyp3a4, gets its clearance speeded up by 44% when
combined with sjw (6 males, 6 females, sjw for 14 days)
[100].
cyp interactions resulting in increased da levels are
demonstrated for the ergots bromocriptine and cabergoline,
as well for the non-ergot  xxxd3145xxx  [27].
concomitant use of bromocriptine, and the cyp3a4
inhbitor erythromycine, increases the auc for bromocriptine with 268% [101]. in the case of cabergoline, the
same pattern can be seen when using another macrolide,

 xxxd1713xxx . concomitant administration gave 1.7 fold
(p<0.01), and 2.6 fold (p<0.01) increase in cabergoline
concentration over 10 hours after dosing, for healthy volunteers (n = 10) and pd patients (n = 7), respectively [102].
similar results were obtained when combining cabergoline
with grapefruit juice in pd patients (n = 5), with a 1.7 fold
increase in the cabergoline concentration [103].
the combination of  xxxd3145xxx  and the cyp1a2 inhibitor
ciprofloaxin (n = 12), results auc increase of  xxxd3145xxx  by
84% [104].
3.2. other interactions
 xxxd3145xxx  treatment is contraindicated in patients with
creatinin clearance < 30 ml/min, [27], while creatinine
clearance < 50 require dose adjustments with pramipexole
[105].
as pramipexole undergoes almost no hepatic biotransformation, and 90% is excreted unchanged in the urine,
potential renal interactions must be evaluated. upon
coadminitsration of other drugs renally secreted by the
cationic transport system, the clearance of pramipexole
decreased 9.0% to 17.7% [27].

as antipsychotic drugs in general, at least partly are da
antagonists, this combination, although sometimes necessary, may reduce the anti-pd efficacy of da agonists.
4. future treatment concepts
4.1. continuous daergic stimulation
according to nutt [106], continuous daergic stimulation
cds is a pd treatment strategy hypothesized to avoid or
reduce the motor complications of long-term l-dopa therapy,
motor fluctuations, and dyskinesia, by preventing or reversing sensitization induced by pulsatile daergic stimulation
[106]. it was pointed out that this hypothesis itself is based
on at least three other hypotheses, and some clinical trials.
comparing l-dopa therapy and da agonists when
discussing cds, will not always give a correct picture as ldopa and da both is a part of the endogenous metabolism, in
contrast to the da agonists, which acts directly on the
receptors [28]. furthermore, l-dopa exerts most of its action
through direct-uptake into da nerve terminals, followed by
conversion to da [107]. other cells containing dopa
carboxylase may also convert l-dopa to da. l-dopa and da
are also precursors for the amines epinephrine (adrenaline)

1062 current topics in medicinal chemistry, 2008, vol. 8, no. 12

and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), both acting on
adrenergic receptors as 2. as blocking of this receptor
(suggested to be located post-synaptic on nonadrenergic
neurons) probably gives an antidyskinetic effect [108], one
should expect increased levels of these catecholamines to
influence dyskinesia, even though it is suggested that the
severity of dyskinesia not is dose dependent [106]. two
studies with continuous around the clock infusions of the da
agonists  xxxd2498xxx  and apomorphine, respectively, gave 25%
and 50% reduction in daily l-dopa dose, respectively.
dyskinesia however, was exacerbated in the case of  xxxd2498xxx ,
and apomorphine had no effect on dyskinesia [106]. these
two studies showed that 45% of the patients had psychiatric
complications, being a reason for confining continuous
administration to the waking-day only [106]. several studies
performing continuous administration during the wakingday, shows one or more of decreased dyskinesia severity,
increased on-time and decreased l-dopa dose [106]. nutt
concluded that it is unlikely that cds mimics the function of
the daergic system in normal brain but argued that constant
drug delivery during the waking day may be the best strategy
for treating pd [106].
a previous meta-analysis by inzelberg et al. [41],
demonstrates that pramipexole (t1/2elim = 8-12 h) and
 xxxd3145xxx  (t1/2elim= 6 h) are more likely to reduce dyskinesia
compared to l-dopa than cabergoline is (t1/2 = 63 - 110 h).
the odds ratios compared to l-dopa were 0.25, 0.31 and
0.38, respectively. this may indicate that the receptor profile
of the da is more important for this motor complication than
is the t1/2elim, in this case probably due to d1 stimulation [27].
this lack of correlation between blood t1/2elim and ability to
reduce dyskinesia may also sometimes be explained (at least
partly) by the fact that the t1/2elim in the brain and in the blood
may be different.
4.2. future drugs and their properties
table 2 summarizes potential clinical efficacy and side
effects related to existing and some potential future drugs
under development for the treatment of pd, based on animal
and/or human studies. of course, the da agonists ability to
exert action on different da-receptors has drawn most
attention, and the recent years, also their action on
serotonergic receptors, probably due to the 5-ht2b induced
fibrosis.
fabbrini et al. [34] identified three 5-ht receptors as
potential therapeutic targets (table 2), and agonism/ antagonism on these may be abilities one wish to put into new
da agonists (or other drugs), at the same time as one should
avoid 5-ht2b agonism and possibly 5-ht1b agonism due to
the fibrotic issues (table 2).
as antagonism on 2 adrenergic receptors are shown to
prevent expression of established dyskinesia [34], one should
consider avoiding da agonists with agonistic properties like
pergolide.
based on the studies with da agonists in pd, and
evaluating their clinical efficacy on motor symptoms in
general, towards their daergic receptor profiles, it seems
that d2 stimulations alone is not as effective as stimulations
of d2, d3, d4 (pramipexole and ropinorole) or a more “da
like” profile, also having more activity on the d1 like

kvernmo et al.

receptors (ergot da agonists and  xxxd3148xxx ). thus, evaluating the current da agonists clinical motor-efficacy, it seems
that d2, d3 and d4 stimulation is sufficient, as the additional
d1-like stimulation of da agonists may only increase the
likelihood for dyskinesia, not the efficacy.
among the other receptor-types pointed out as potential
targets for pd treatment, is development of selective nmda
antagonists identified as a major area of new developments
[34]. interestingly, oehlwein et al. showed that a combination of da, nmda antagonist (amantadine (adamantan-1amine) or budipine (1-tert-butyl-4,4-dicyclohexylpiperidine))
and the mao-b inhibitor seligiline (n-methyl-n-(1-methyl2-phenyl-ethyl)-prop-2-yn-1 xxxd2850xxx ) kept 120 of 141 pd
patients away from adjunctive l-dopa therapy for ten years,
also resulting in lack of dyskinesia and motor fluctuations
[109]. a recent study on mptp parkinsonian monkeys, using
the antagonist ci-1041 (2(3h)-benzoxazolone, 6-((2-(4-((4fluorophenyl)methyl)-1- piperidinyl)ethyl)sulfinyl)), selective for nr1a/2b subtype nmda receptors adjunctive to ldopa, prevented lid [110 ]. this is suggested to be due to
normalization of the gabaa receptor [110]. the same effect
was observed when using low doses of cabergoline, probably
due to its d2 agonist activity [110].
5. discussion and conclusions
discussion
as the pathophysiological origin of rls still is unclear,
and this disease obviously is different from pd, proposals of
future improvements of da agonists in this disease are very
challenging. furthermore, the rls symptoms seems to be
most pronounced in the evening and the night adding another
issue; whether treatment in general should be given only in
the periods with pronounced clinical symptoms (pramipexole
ir and  xxxd3145xxx  ir), or continuous 24 hour treatment
should be preferred (as  xxxd3148xxx ), remains to be addressed.
as one of the markers for rls seems to be increased
extracellular da, and the daily doses of da for treatment is
significantly lower than those used in pd, one should
consider this a daergic dysfunction, not necessarily a state
of daergic deficient.
within pd, d2 and d3/d4 and/or d1 agonist-activity
seems to be crucial for optimal motor efficacy of the da
agonists: all da agonists on the market have one of these
receptor profiles. unfortunately, the d2 - and d4-receptors
seems to be involved in the rare, but potential serious side
effect pathological gambling [31], while the  xxxg658xxx 
seems to be involved insudden onset sleep [30]. as all the
da agonists exerts significant d2 agonism (table 1), this
may explain why pathological gambling are believed to be
side effects for all da agonists [111]. sudden onset sleep
may partly be explained by d4 polymorphism [55]. this is in
accordance with the study of paus et al. [30], showing no
significant difference in the frequency of sleep attacks
among the da agonists evaluated [30]. furthermore, this is
also in accordance with the receptor profile (table 1),
showing that all the evaluated da agonists have d4-receptor
activity.
as da and l-dopa induced dyskinesia, at least partly,
seems to have different mechanisms of action, and
combination therapy is common, strategies to treat/prevent

receptor-binding and pharmacokinetic properties

these different types of dyskinesias are important.  xxxg655xxx  induced dyskinesia may be limited by choosing da
agonists without pronounced d1 activity, which is suggested
when doing indirect comparisons of da agonists with
different d1 activities [38, 41]. furthermore, d1 agonism
seems to be more important for development of dyskinesia
than the halflife.
this observations may to some extent be challenged by
 xxxd3148xxx , given as a patch (continuous delivery), and
basically, having a receptor profile resembling that of ldopa (table 1). the present clinical data is not indicative of
more dyskinesias than with pramipexole [111], which may
be partly be explained with its 5-ht1a agonism, at least
believed to prevent lid (table 2), but not necessarily d1
induced dyskinesia [34]. furthermore, its d1 activity’s
potential negative impact on dyskinesia, may also be
counterbalanced by its high selectivity for d3-receptors
within the d2 sub-family, as d3-agonism also is suggested to
prevent dyskinesia [34]. most important is maybe the fact
that the only study comparing  xxxd3148xxx  with other da
agonists, only had a follow up for 6 months [111], thus being
less conclusive with respect to the potential for development
of dyskinesia and/or to prevent lid. a long term study
comparing  xxxd3148xxx  with l-dopa and/or another non-ergot
da would have been of outmost interest to address these
issues.
based on the current knowledge, connecting receptorprofiles to clinical data, da agonists preferring the d2-like
receptors, with selectivity for the  xxxg657xxx  seems to be
beneficial, leading to optimal motor efficacy, including the
potential prevention of long term down-regulation of the
crucial d3 receptors in striatum. this has also been suggested
to explain the efficacy of the d3 selective da agonist
pramipexole (table 1) on patients with high tremor score as
well as its efficacy on treatment resistant tremor [27].
furthermore, d3 selective agonists seem to prevent/treat
depression, being neuroprotective and reduce the risk for
dyskinesias [27, 34, 47, 64, 73-87].
in general, all the ergots do have high affinity for 5-ht
receptors, and except from  xxxd2498xxx  being an antagonist and
bromocriptine a partial agonist for the 5-ht2b-receptor, all
the ergots are agonists for the 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx ,5ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c receptors (table 1). to evaluate
whether this gives positive clinical outputs is difficult as all
except one ergot (bromocriptine) are d1 agonists (table 1).
however, the tendency showing more dyskinesias with the
ergots cabergoline (20 times higher affinity for the 5-ht1a
receptor than the  xxxg655xxx ) and pergolide (95 times higher
affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx  than the  xxxg655xxx ) both
being relatively strong  xxxg1108xxx  agonists (table 1),
than with the non-ergots pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx  [27],
may be indicative of  xxxg1108xxx  agonism being less
important for dyskinesia than lack of d1 agonism. whether
the combination of  xxxg1108xxx  agonism and d2,- and d3
receptor activity gives synergies, will hopefully be addressed
by the ongoing clinical studies with slv308 (7-[4-methyl-1piperazinyl]-2(3h)-benzoxazolone,
monohydrochloride),
which is a partial da d2 ,- and  xxxg657xxx  agonist and
serotonin  xxxg1108xxx  agonist [112].

on the other hand, both 5-ht1b agonism and 5-ht2b
agonism (being the case for at least 2- ergots) may contribute
to fibrosis and vhd ([61], table 2). it is also suggested that
5-ht2a agonists and 5-ht2c agonists induces hallucinogenic
activity (table 2). antagonism on 2 adrenergic receptors is
shown to prevent expression of established dyskinesia [34],
and one should thus consider avoiding da agonists with
agonistic properties.
to date, we are not aware of any da agonists having any
nmda-receptor antagonistic properties, even though this
may have been a very interesting approach as the
combination of nmda-receptor antagonist, da and  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitor has been shown to be an effective non-l-dopa
treatment [109], also giving a low rate of dyskinesia.
the concept of cds is probably beneficial during the
waking day [106], but it was concluded that it not is likely to
avoid sensitization and tolerance [106]. furthermore, more
acute and long-term dopaminergic toxicity may be an
unintended consequence [106]. based on the general
knowledge, indirect comparison of bromocriptine and cabergoline [38],  xxxd3145xxx , pramipexole and cabergoline [41]
strongly indicates that the receptor profile is more important
than halftime, and thus cds, for preventing dyskinesia.
lack of cyp2d6 activity seems to be connected to pd
aetiology [91-95], but there is no clear evidence whether this
is connected to the enzymes in the liver, in the cns or both.
furthermore, lack of cyp2d6 activity is also associated
with personality characteristics of social cognitive anxiety,
which may bear some resemblance to milder forms of
psychotic-like symptoms [90], which may be consider
worrying as psychotic-like symptoms are a part of pdsymptoms. thus, da agonists should ideally not be strong
cyp2d6 inhibitors.
conclusions
based on the current knowledge, taking into consideration the receptor-profiles described in table 2 and the
clinical outcome upon agonism/antagonism on these, activity
on d2-like receptors, with preference for the  xxxg657xxx 
seems to be most beneficial. regarding 5-ht-receptor
activity, 5-ht1a agonism (prevention of dyskinesia) as well
5-ht2b antagonism (potential prevention of vhd or at least
devoid of being causative of vhd) seems to be beneficial.
activities on the other 5-ht receptors described in table 2
may result in adverse events or a combination of a beneficial
clinical outcome and adverse events. furthermore, antagonism on 2 adrenergic receptors seem beneficial.
lack of cyp2d6 activity may be an issue within the
etiology of pd as well as for inducing pd-like cns symptoms, possibly favoring da agonists without cyp2d6
inhibition. thus, future development of da agonists
containing these properties may be beneficial. one must
however, also take into consideration future clinical studies
with drugs as  xxxd3148xxx  and slv308 which further may
contribute to increased knowledge, further addressing
clinical outcomes and their biological correlates.
