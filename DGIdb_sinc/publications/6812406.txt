antiarrhythmic, antifibrillatory, and hemodynamic actions of
 xxxd326xxx  sulfate: an orally effective analog of  xxxd364xxx 
for suppression of ventricular tachyarrhythmias
marvin b. bacaner, md and david g. benditt, md

 xxxd326xxx  sulfate is a chemical and pharmacologic analog of  xxxd364xxx  tosylate that has virtually
identical antifibrillatory and inotropic actions on the
heart.  xxxd364xxx  is the only drug approved by the
food and drug administration specifically for the
“prophylaxis and treatment of ventricular fibrillation.” unlike  xxxd364xxx , which is poorly absorbed
from the gut and limited to parenteral use, oral
 xxxd326xxx  is absorbed rapidly.  xxxd326xxx  was
given to 23 patients with recurrent multiple drug
refractory ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
eighteen patients (78 % ) had complete suppression
of spontaneous or electrophysiologically inducible

tachyarrhythmias; 3 were improved and 2 had no
benefit. in 6 of a 9 patient subgroup studied by programmed electrophysiologic drug testing,  xxxd326xxx  completely prevented previously inducible
ventricular tachyarrhythmias at the maximal stimulus tested (including 4 extrastimuli and burstpacing  xxxd1891xxx  times threshold). cardiac output
measured in 6 patients 1 to 2 hours after  xxxd326xxx 
was increased in 4, unchanged in 2, and decreased
in 1. ten patients on long-term therapy with
 xxxd326xxx  and protriptylene (to prevent orthostatic
hypotension) have been free of arrhythmias from 2
to 26 (average 13) months.

because of disappointing

that
 xxxd326xxx 
increased

normal canine heart and 327% in the infarcted heart and
resulted in nonsustained
vf.7,8
in pilot human trials  xxxd326xxx ,
like  xxxd364xxx , also
was effective in suppressing
arrhythmias
and vf.“,40
similarly,
both drugs induced
orthostatic
hypotension.gj1,24,2s,40 in deciding in 1965 which drug to test in
major clinical studies,  xxxd364xxx 
was chosen because
tolerance to orthostatic hypotension
developed quickly,
allowing patients
to be ambulated.24~2rj1,:~9~42 in contrast, tolerance to orthostatic hypotension
almost never
developed
during  xxxd326xxx 
treatment
(4.1 and unpublished
observations).
thus, persistent
orthostatic
hypotension
precluded the successful use of  xxxd326xxx 
as an antifibrillatory
drug in ambulatory
patients and
studies were abandoned.
it has since been learned that orthostatic hypotension
induced by both  xxxd364xxx 
and  xxxd326xxx 
can be effectively antagonized
by a variety of drugs, particularly
tricyclic
antidepressants
such as protriptyline
and
desipramine
which are believed to block the norepinephrine
pump.4c3,44 if  xxxd326xxx 
can be used in ambulatory patients by combined therapy with a tricyclic,
this could be an effective oral means of preventing

methods
patient selection: twenty-three
consecutive patients with
repetitive unsustained
vt (runs of 6 to 99 ventricular ectopic
beats) or sustained
vt (more than 100 beats) were treated
with  xxxd326xxx 
because they could not be controlled
by
other antiarrhythmic
drug regimes. sixteen patients also had
from 1 to 20 episodes of vf. the patients had a variety of
heart diseases, and 16 patients had congestive heart failure
when  xxxd326xxx 
was started.
all patients were accepted if (1) they had multiple episodes
of out-of-hospital
life-threatening
vt and/or at least 1 episode
of primary vf, (2) they could take oral medication,
and (3)
they gave informed consent. all other antiarrhythmic
drugs
were discontinued.
in 10 patients,
tachyarrhythmias
were
initially treated successfully
with betylium before a trial of
 xxxd326xxx .
in each patient,  xxxd364xxx  was discontinued
and
treatment
with  xxxd326xxx 
was not started until tachyarrhythmias
reappeared
to make certain that acute efficacy of
bet,hanidine could be assessed clearly from the time course of
the response.
patients
received a loading dose of  xxxd326xxx 
ranging
from 3 to :%omg/kg and a maintenance
dose of 10 to 40 mg/kg
per day. all patients
also received protriptyline,
15 to 120
mg/day, in divided doses to antagonize orthostatic
hypotension.
specific
drug testing by programmed electrophysiologic stimulation: nine patients had cardiac catheterization
to place electrodes for programmed
electrophysiologic
study.
bach patient had had 1 or more cardiac arrests outside the
hospital. in the initial electrophysiologic
study, quadrapole
catheter electrodes
were positioned
in the right atrium, his
bundle, and right ventricle for recording, pacing, and stimu
lation. an arterial line was placed in 7 patients to assess the
effect of  xxxd326xxx 
on cardiac output (measured
by dye
dilution).
the test routine was designed to induce vt by delivering
from 1 to 4 programmed
ventricular
extrastimuli
(at 2 times
threshold current) to the right ventricle while it was paced at
a cycle length range of 400 to 500 ms. a rest interval of at least
10 sinus heats was taken before introduction
of extrastimuli.
the program systematically
added and shifted the extrastimuli in the cardiac cycle and varied the coupling interval.
when vt could not he induced by 4 sequential
extrastimuli,
ventricular
burst-pacing
(6 to 10 beats) was used. starting
with a cycle length of 400 ms, it was progressively
shortened
to 2:h) ms or until l-to-l ventricular
capture was no longer
possible. the end point of the study was the induction of reproducible episodes of either unsustained
or sustained vt or
hursts of’ vf or flutter which were terminated
by rapid right
ventricular
pacing or electrical cardioversion.
after vt was reproducibly
induced during the control
study. the test drug was administered
and the procedure repeated. the test drugs used were  xxxd326xxx ,
quinidine,

procainamide, and disopyramide. starting with patient 5
(table i), when  xxxd326xxx 
was found to prevent previously
inducible tachyarrhythmia
with 4 extrastimuli or burst-pacing
at 2 times threshold
(approximately
1 ma), the current
strength
was increased
to 10 times threshold
(8 ma, the
maximal
output of the current generator).
the stimulus
routine was then repeated
as the ultimate test of  xxxd326xxx -induced
resistance to initiation of ventricular tachyar
rhythmia.
the test dose of  xxxd326xxx 
ranged from 16 to :30
mg/kg. it was given with 10 to 15 mg of protriptyline
to test
the interaction
with  xxxd326xxx .
cardiac output was measured in triplicate by indicator dilution technique before and
again i to 2 hours after the oral loading dose of hethani
dine.

initially 16 mg/kg of hethanidine with 10 mg of protriptyline
were given and tested 1 to 1.5 hours after administration.
this
was followed by a second 8 mg/kg dose tested 45 minutes later.
the initial loading dose of hethanidine
was increased to 20
mg/kg given with 15 mg of protriptyline.
to exclude dose
dependence,
an additional dose of 10 mg/kg  xxxd326xxx 
was
given if the initial dose did not completely prevent inducible
arrhythmia
with 4 extrastimuli
or burst-pacing.
the order in which test drugs were given was varied randomly and 3 to 4 days were allowed for the previous drug to
be eliminated.
the doses of quinidine,
procainamide,
and
disopyramide
used were the highest doses considered
safe as
judged by changes in conduction
and checked by measuring
blood levels drawn immediately
after the test procedure.
blood levels of  xxxd326xxx 
were measured
in serial blood
samples drawn during electrophysiologic

results
the patients included
16 men and 7 women aged 21
to 75 years (mean 53). before treatment
with  xxxd326xxx , all patients
had recurrent
episodes
ofventricular
tachyarrhythmias
lasting
3 days to 1.5 years and 16
patients
had episodes
of vf. these tachyarrhythmias
had not been suppressed
by aggressive treatment
with
3 or more antiarrhythmic
drugs singly or in various
combinations
before  xxxd326xxx 
was administered.
 xxxd326xxx 
suppressed
existing repetitive
or electrically inducible
vt and vf in 18 (78%) of 23 patients,
none of whom had further tachyarrhythmia
while on
 xxxd326xxx .
ten patients in whom tachyarrhythmias
had been previously
suppressed
with  xxxd364xxx 
had
recurrences
8 hours to 6 days after  xxxd364xxx 
was discontinued.
in each patient,  xxxd326xxx 
suppressed the
recurring
tachyarrhythmia
as early as 6 minutes or as
late as 5 hours after ingestion
(fig. 1 and 2). delay
greater than 2 hours in the onset of action and ultimate
efficacy appeared
dose-dependent
in patients who received a starting
dose less than 20 mg/kg. in 3 other
patients with recurrent
episodes of vt, tachyarrhythmias were temporarily
suppressed
or became more
difficult to induce during programmed
electrophysiologic drug testing. in 3 patients,
 xxxd326xxx 
was effective but was discontinued
because of side effects. in

with 1, 2, or 3 programmed
extrastimuli;
the other patient
was having
frequent
spontaneous
episodes of unsustained

effect on stimulus tolerance:  xxxd326xxx  treatment (16 to 30 mg/kg) completely
protected
6 of the 9
patients
from inducible
arrhythmia
at the maximal
stimulus intensity
tested (table i). except for patient
2 (table i) who was protected by both  xxxd326xxx 
and
quinidine, no other patient in this group received a drug
other than  xxxd326xxx 
which prevented
inducible
arrhythmias at maximal stimulation.
three patients, who

after  xxxd326xxx ,
tolerated

two other patients
(patients

in that resistance
to induction
of vt increased from 3 to 4 extrastimuli,
and from 2 to
3 extrastimuli.
one patient had no benefit from any

antiarrhythmic

blood levels: after a 16 mg/kg dose, serial blood
samples in 3 patients
indicated
that the  xxxd326xxx 
blood level rises rapidly to 0.18 to 0.25 pg/ml within 15
minutes.  xxxd326xxx 
blood levels continued
to rise to
levels of 0.74 to 1.51 pm/ml 1.5 to 2 hours after ingestion
where maximal protection
against inducible
arrhythmias was observed.
effect of other antiarrhythmic
drugs on stimulus
tolerance:
the effect of quinidine
at doses up to 6
@g/ml blood levels was assessed in 4 patients,
but only
1 patient had any benefit. in 2 patients vt became more
easily inducible
on quinidine
than in the control state.
two patients who were well protected
by  xxxd326xxx 
alone had no benefit from  xxxd326xxx 
when it was given
immediately
after quinidine
testing.
procainamide
in doses up to 16.7 kg/ml and 10.4
pg/ml napa was studied in 5 patients,
but none were
protected at the maximal stimulus tested. one patient’s
tolerance increased from 3 to 4 extrastimuli
before vt
was induced. after administration
of  xxxd326xxx ,
vt
could not be induced in this patient with 4 extrastimuli
or burst-pacing
 xxxd1891xxx  times threshold. disopyramide
was
of no value in 2 patients t.ested. it was not tested in other
patients because it was contraindicated
by severe congestive heart failure.
effect on cardiac
hemodynamics:
one to 2 hours
after oral  xxxd326xxx ,
cardiac output and stroke volume increased in 4 patients, remained essentially
unchanged in 2 patients, and decreased in 1 patient (table
i). heart rate and supine blood pressure were essentially
unchanged
from control values.
outpatient
experience:
fifteen patients were discharged on doses of  xxxd326xxx  ranging from 10 to 40
mg/kg per day and protriptyline 15 to 80 mglday in divided doses, and 13 patients (86%) had no further episodes of vt or vf while on  xxxd326xxx .
although effective in suppressing
ventricular
tachyarrhythmia,
 xxxd326xxx 
was discontinued
in 3 patients: in 1 because
of pregnancy,
1 because of anxiety over taking an investigational
drug, and i because of persistent
orthostatic hypotension.
two patients on  xxxd326xxx 
died
after discharge from the hospital.
long-term
maintenance
on  xxxd326xxx :
ten
patients
have been maintained
on  xxxd326xxx 
from 2
to 26 months (average 13) with complete suppression
of tachyarrhythmia.
periodic holter monitor studies in
all patients
every 2 to 3 months
have shown single
ventricular
ectopic beats and pairs but no triples or runs
of vt, except as described
later. when ectopic pairs
were noted on the holter record, the dose of  xxxd326xxx 
was increased
by 50 to 100 mgldose and adjusted
to
subsequent
holter
findings.
after 14 months
on
 xxxd326xxx 
1 patient reported a brief episode of
symptoms, which may have been a run of vt that disappeared
3 to 4 minutes
after he took 700 mg of
 xxxd326xxx .
except for that instance he has been free
of symptoms
for 26 months and has returned
to fulltime work for the past 22 months. one other patient had
a single episode of vt 3 months after discharge, at
which time the serum potassium level was 2.7 meq/liter.

discussion

 xxxd326xxx  was safe and effective in acutely suppressing both spontaneous and electrophysiologically
inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias
in 78% of the
23 patients treated. ten patients on long-term maintenance treatment with  xxxd326xxx  and protriptyline
have been free of tachyarrhythmia
for 2 to 26 months
(mean 13). all 23 patients had recurrent vt and 16 had
1 or more out-of-hospital
cardiac arrests. these tachyarrhythmias
had been previously
refractory
to at least
3 other antiarrhythmic
drugs used singly or in various
combinations.
sixteen patients had moderate to severe
congestive heart failure.
another potentially
beneficial effect of  xxxd326xxx 
was its positive inotropic action8 which was manifested
by an increase in cardiac output in two thirds of the
patients tested. because increased cardiac output was
observed 1 to 2 hours after administration
of  xxxd326xxx , it was unlikely to be solely an effect of catecholamine release, which would probably be much shorter
in duration.
the long-term
effects on cardiac performance have not been assessed, but the patients maintained on  xxxd326xxx 
have shown no adverse hemodynamic effects.
test of efficacy:
the test of efficacy relied on each

patient as his own control. great care was taken to
etablish (1) that tachyarrhythmias
were indeed repetitive and refractory to other drugs, and (2) that efficacy
could be judged by an appropriate interval between the
time  xxxd326xxx  was administered and the time that
sustained elimination of the arrhythmia occurred.
electrophysiologic
drug testing by programmed
ventricular stimulation is widely accepted as a reproducible semiquantitative
method of evaluating and
matching the efficacy of a drug and its dose to a patient’s specific arrhythmogenic
cardiac disorder.da-52
in our 9 patients undergoing programmed drug study,
this was an acceptable controlled evaluation. in the
other 14 patients the criteria for efficacy were less rigorous because evaluation of data was based on rhythm
history and evidence of acute suppression. in each request for treatment with  xxxd326xxx , an experienced
cardiologist indicated that either (1) the arrhythmias
were persistent,
lasting at least 3 days, (2) all other
antiarrhythmic
drugs tested had failed clinically, or (3)
the arrhythmia
was successfully
suppressed
with
 xxxd364xxx 
but an oral drug was also needed to send the
patient home. in 10 patients
in whom the arrhythmia
was initially suppressed
with  xxxd364xxx ,
it was discon-

returned.
dose-dependent
efficacy: it also was apparent that
the onset of action was dose-dependent
(fig. 1). with
a low dose of  xxxd326xxx 
(3 mg/kg), initial conversion
to sinus rhythm began in 8 minutes after ingestion and
lasted 10 minutes, but was then interrupted
on the 18th
minute by another 2 minute burst of vt before definitive reversion
to sinus rhythm occurred on the 20th
minute after sufficient  xxxd326xxx 
had been absorbed.
after 3 days  xxxd326xxx 
was stopped and 45 hours later
vt returned. when a larger loading dose (9 mg/kg) was
given for the second episode of vt, definitive conversion
to sinus rhythm occurred after 6 minutes. such a rapid
response
suggests
that
the therapeutic
level of
 xxxd326xxx 
needed to suppress vt had fallen to only
slightly below the antiarrhythmic
threshold
concentration. only 6 minutes were needed to absorb the small
amount of  xxxd326xxx 
needed to bring the drug back
to a therapeutic
level.
the dose-dependent
action of  xxxd326xxx 
was also
demonstrable
during programmed
electrophysiologic
drug testing when  xxxd326xxx 
was tested after administration
of each additional
dose and stimulus tolerance was observed to increase with each dose up to 30
mg/kg.
electrophysiologic
drug testing: the complete
prevention
of inducible
arrhythmias
in 6 of 9 patients
and the partial protection
in 2 others after  xxxd326xxx 
intake was a very favorable frequency
of success for a
single drug. moreover,  xxxd326xxx 
was the only tested
drug that was significantly
effective in any patient except for quinidine
in 1 patient. by comparison,
reports
on many antiarrhythmic
drugs from centers
using
electrophysiotopic
drug testing indicate that in only 30
to 50% of patients tested did any drug or combination
of drugs prevent inducible
tachyarrhythmia.4fi-s2
the maximal number of extrastimuli
used was progressively
increased
during the course of the study.
when patients tolerated 3 extrastimuli
and burst-pacing, 4 extrastimuli
were tested. in later studies, when’
patients
on  xxxd326xxx 
tolerated
4 extrastimuli
and
burst-pacing
at 2 times threshold,
the current was increased to the maximal current output of the system (8
ma), which was approximately
10 times threshold, and
the test protocol was repeated. of 3 patients subjected
to this extreme provocation,
none had inducible
arrhythmia
while on  xxxd326xxx ,
although arrhythmias
were readily inducible
in all in the control state or on
other drugs. this was by far the most aggressive attempt
to induce arrthythmias
by programmed
ventricular
stimulation
reported from any laboratory.“e~~z
it is true that the superthreshold
stimulation
was
much greater than any provocation
that can occur
clinically short of electrocution.
nevertheless,
 xxxd326xxx  demonstrated
a protective
action that was not
obtainable
with any other antiarrhythmic
drug tested.
it remains to be established
that such a test is clinically
meaningful.
one potential
value of superthreshold
stimulation
is
that it may provide a basis for distinguishing
between
drugs when several drugs prevent inducible arrhythmias

in 1 patient,
both quinidine
and  xxxd326xxx 
prevented
inducible
arrhythmias
with 4 extrastimuli
or burst-pacing
at twice
threshold.
this patient, therefore,
was discharged
on
quinidine
because it was prudent
to use an approved
drug rather than an investigational
drug when both
appeared
equal in ability to prevent induced arrhythmias. the patient died suddenly
6 months after discharge. if an additional
superthreshold
challenge had
shown that  xxxd326xxx 
was more protective
than
quinidine
at io times threshold, the patient might have
been discharged
on  xxxd326xxx .
of the patients

patients discharged
on other drugs died suddenly.
drug antagonism:
 xxxd326xxx 
should not be given
together with quinidine,
which was found to antagonize
its therapeutic
effect in 2 patients. similar antagonism
to  xxxd364xxx 
efficacy also has been reported
with
quinidine
as well as procainamide
and other cardiodepressant
antiarrhythmic
drugs. 6,24,31,5:3 concomitant
administration
of  xxxd326xxx 
with other antiarrhythmic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants
other than protriptyline
probably
should be avoided until compatibility can be demonstrated.
pharmacologic
side effects: the only significant
side effect of  xxxd326xxx 
is orthostatic hypotension.
no
acute toxicity occurs in the dogs at 300 mglkg, which is
10 times the highest therapeutic
dose.4:’ no chronic

nerve endings, and the resulting
chemical
sympathectomy
reduces
peripheral
resistance.” blood pressure in the supine position may decrease but usually changes little because the positive
inotropic effect usually increases cardiac output sufficiently to compensate
for the decrease in peripheral
resistance.”
orthostatic
hypotension,
however,
is a
regular pharmacologic
side effect of  xxxd326xxx 
which
is aggravated
by inhibition
of baroreceptor

therapy.
protriptyline
did not interfere
with the antiarrhythmic-antifibrillatory
actions
of
 xxxd326xxx 
as the arrhythmias
remained
suppressed
after protriptyline
was added. indeed, some tricyclic
antidepressants
have been reported to increase the vf
threshold.“4
moreover,
in our recent animal experiments, protriptyline
alone increased the vf threshold
and also had a synergistic interaction
with  xxxd326xxx 
so that a combination
of the 2 drugs increased the vf
threshold
higher than did either drug alone (unpublished observations).
the first 13 patients
did not receive protriptyline
until it was clear that their arrhythmias
were suppressed
by  xxxd326xxx .
the dose of protriptyline
needed to
raise the vf threshold (5 mg/kg) was much higher than
even the highest dose used to antagonize the orthostatic
volume 50

antiarrhythmic

hypotension,
indicating
that protriptyline
itself does
not account for the antiarrhythmic
effect observed in
patients on both drugs. nortriptyline
did not raise the
vf threshold
of the canine heart and appeared to antagonize
 xxxd326xxx 
action
(unpublished
observations).
despite
effective
suppression
of arrhythmias,
 xxxd326xxx 
was discontinued
in 2 patients because of
persistent
orthostatic
hypotension.
one patient
had
severe congestive heart failure. he had an abnormally
low resting cardiac output which was lowered still further by  xxxd326xxx ;
he was the only patient in which
this occurred.
persistent
orthostatic
hypotension
probably reflected a limited cardiac reserve, so that the
decrease in peripheral
resistance was not compensated
by the positive inotropic action of  xxxd326xxx .
in the
second patient,  xxxd326xxx 
was discontinued
because
orthostatic
hypotension
persisted
with 40 mglday of
protriptyline
and at that time we were not yet using
higher doses of protriptyline.
 xxxd326xxx 
dosage: we started cautiously
at the
low end of the  xxxd326xxx 
dose (3 mg/kg) that was
found to increase the vf threshold
in the dog.s it became apparent in our first patient (fig. 1) that this dose
was marginal, so we quickly increased the loading dose.
in the patients
studied
by electrophysiologic
drug
testing, it became apparent
that 20 mg/kg followed by
another 10 mg/kg, if needed, was generally effective in
preventing
inducible
arrhythmia
with  xxxd326xxx .
guide to maintenance
therapy: after the 20 mg/kg
loading dose, maintenance
therapy was started using
5 to 8 mglkg  xxxd326xxx 
4 times daily together with 30
to 80 mg/day of protriptyline
in divided doses. ambulation began with dangling the legs at the bedside and
walking only with assistance. if symptoms of orthostasis
persisted,
the protriptyline
dose was increased
progressively
until all symptoms
(dizziness
or syncope)
were eliminated.
one patient received 120 mg/day for
1 day, but this dose should not be continued
for more
than 1 day because of the possibility
of an anticholinergic reaction. it is safer to take more time at doses of
60 to 80 mg/day. patients
were instructed
to change to
the upright position slowly to allow for slow adaptation
to position changes and to take an extra 5 mg of protriptyline
as necessary in addition to the regular doses
if they became lightheaded
after discharge. if protriptyline (15 mg tid) is given for 3 days before starting
 xxxd326xxx 
the patients can be ambulated
immediately
(robins ah, unpublished
observations).
 xxxd326xxx 
dosage was adjusted upward by 50 to 100
mg per dose or per alternate
dose if pairs or triple ventricular
extra beats were observed.
no attempt
was
made to suppress single ventricular
extra beats (even
if frequent) or even short episodes of bigeminal rhythm.
long episodes may respond to an increase in dose, but
the objective of treatment
should be to prevent vt and
vf by increasing
the vf threshold
so that premature
beats are rendered harmless.
the antihypotensive
action of protriptyline
began
about 4 hours after administration
but took many hours
or days to achieve maximal effect. protriptyline
tends
to have cumulative
effects, so after 4 to 6 weeks the

protriptyline
dose was reduced. this was done by reducing the dose by 5 mg/24 hours. after the initial adjustment
period, most patients got along well on 15 to
30 mg/day of protriptyline.
impotence
has occasionally
been a bothersome
side effect of sympathetic
blockade
but was eliminated
by increasing
the dose of protriptyline. one patient had persistent nausea which caused
anorexia.
despite
a good therapeutic
response,
 xxxd326xxx 
was discontinued
and the nausea disappeared.
comparison
of  xxxd326xxx 
and  xxxd364xxx :
 xxxd326xxx ,
like  xxxd364xxx ,
is not in a free diffusion
equilibrium
with tissue but is selectively concentrated
and bound in heart, sympathetic
nerves, liver, and
spleen. s5 the therapeutic
effect of  xxxd364xxx 
correlates
with its myocardial and not its plasma concentration.56
 xxxd326xxx 
very likely has similar kinetic characteristics. corders7 has calculated
the steady state volume
distribution
equilibrium
for  xxxd326xxx 
at 2.7 liters/
mg, which indicates that a large proportion
of the drug
is outside the bloodstream.
while similar in chemical structure
and pharmacologic characteristics,
 xxxd364xxx 
is poorly absorbed from
the gut because the strong fixed positive charge in the
side chain
limits
lipid
solubility.ag
in contrast,
 xxxd326xxx 
is likely to be rapidly transported
across the
gut and into myocardial
cells because the dimethylguanidine
on the side chain is more lipid-soluble
then
the charged quanternary
ammonium
(fig. 3). in dogs,
the vf threshold
rises 10 minutes after oral  xxxd326xxx .s the prompt suppression
of vt also indicates
a rapid onset of action in man (fig. 1).
adequate
potassium
required
for efficacy:
 xxxd326xxx ,
like  xxxd364xxx ,
probably acts directly on
the myocardial
cell, altering potassium,
sodium, and
calcium transport
and distribution.a*s
specific studies
on the mechanism
of action of  xxxd326xxx ,
however,
have not been done. an important
element in  xxxd364xxx 
efficacy, which also appears true for  xxxd326xxx ,
is that
myocardial
and serum potassium
must be normal for
the drug to be effective .6,25 neither drug appears to
work well when potassium
is depleted.
since many
cardiac patients with arrhythmias
are receiving diuretic
agents, digitalis glycosides,
and conventional
antiarrhythmic drugs, all of which tend to deplete intracellular
potassium,
it is important
to assess and restore myocardial potassium to normal levels in patients receiving
 xxxd326xxx .
 xxxd326xxx 
tends to reduce serum potassium as potassium
shifts into cells. because serum
potassium
may be in the normal
range even when

myocardial potassium is low, it is our practice to keep
serum potassium in the high normal range (4.5 meq/
liter).
