summary
in binding studies with rat brain membranes, 1,4-benzodiazepines
containing a t r i f l u o r o e t h y l moeity at the i-n p o s i t i o n ,
including  xxxd2255xxx  and  xxxd3058xxx , had s i g n i f i c a n t l y higher
a f f i n i t i e s for binding sites in cerebellum than in cortex. thls
s e l e c t l v i t y for cerebellar sites is not a property of
benzodiazepines without the t r i f l u o r o e t h y l moiety, but is
similar to that seen with the t r i a z o l o p y r i d a z i n e s .
since
 xxxd2255xxx  and  xxxd3058xxx , l i k e the t r i a z o l o p y r i d a z i n e s , have
behavioral effects in anlmals at doses much lower than those
that cause ataxia, i t is tempting to a t t r i b u t e t h i s separation
of pharmacologic a c t i v i t i e s to d i f f e r e n t i a l a c t i v i t y at
sub~opulations of benzodiazepine receptors. further work is
necessary to c l a r i f y this p o s s i b i l i t y .

the benzodiazepines constitute a structural group of organic compounds
which have clinical use as anxiolytics, hypnotics, muscle relaxants and/or
anticonvulsants. these drugs exhibit in vitro binding to specific receptor
sltes in brain (3,4,5) with a high correlation between pharmacologic
activity and binding potency (6). the demonstration of multiple
benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ) receptor sites (7,8,9) posed the possibility that the
different pharmacologic effects of  xxxd1459xxx 's were related to action at
different  xxxd1459xxx  receptor sites. this was of high interest to us because of
two unique benzodiazepines developed in our laboratory.  xxxd2255xxx 
(marketed as the anxiolytic  xxxd2255xxx ) had only weak ataxic effects in
animals at doses far above tranquilizing doses (1) and appeared to e l i c i t
minimal drug seeking behavior, as shown in monkeys (10) and in humans (11).
 xxxd3058xxx , unlike other bzds, caused only drowsiness and sleep in cats,
again at doses below those that caused ataxia (12,13). in addition,
tolerance to its a b i l i t y to block shock-induced seizures was not observed
after repeated administration to mice (12). accordingly, we evaluated the
a b i l i t y of these drugs, their major metabo~ites, and other selected
trifluorethyl bzds (figure i) to displace h-diazepam from rat
cortical, cerebellar, hippocampal, and/or midbrain reticular formation
(mrf) membranes. the cerebellum has been reported to contain almost
apresented in part at the 1983 fasebmeeting in chicago, il (i) and the
1983 aspetmeeting in phila, pa (2).

and hippocampus contain about 60% and 50% of bz retjptors, respectively,
with the remainder being a second subclass termed bz sites (8). the
makeup of the mrf is unknown; this tissue was includtd in experiments
related to  xxxd3058xxx  because it has been reported to be an anatomical locus
of action of hypnotic drugs (14).

materials and methods
a) drugs
diazepam [methyl-3h] (86 ci/mmol) was purchased from new england
nuclear corporation.  xxxd2140xxx  and chlordiazepoxide were gifts from
hoffman-laroche, oxazepam was obtained from wyeth laboratories, and
 xxxd2999xxx  from warner-lambert/parke davis. all other benzodiazepines were
synthesized at schering laboratories (15). all drugs were tested following
thorough suspension in an aqueous vehicle containing  xxxd2609xxx  (4
mg/ml) and  xxxd3449xxx  o.05m, ph 7.4.

b) tissue preparation
male sprague-dawley rats, 200-250 grams, from charles river breeding
laboratories, wilmington, ma were used to obtain brain receptor material.
the rats were decapitated and their brains rapidly removed and placed on
ice. the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were excised, weighed, and
homogenized in 20 volumes of iced 0.32m sucrose using a teflon-glass
apparatus (8 f u l l passes). the homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes
at 2,000 x g and the resultant supernatants recentrifuged for 10 minutes at
30,000 x g. the pellets from the second centrifugation (pp pellets) were
resuspended in 50 times the original tissue weight of 50 mm tris hci, ph
7.4.
c) binding assay
specific, high-affinity 3h-diazepam binding was characterized according
to theqmethod of braestrup and squires (3). assay tubes consisted of 250
~l of ~h-diazepam (yielding a final concentration of 1 nm) and 25 ~l of
 xxxd3449xxx  alone orotris buffer containing displacing bzds. the tubes
were incubated at 37 c for 15 min followed by transfer to an ice bath for
45 minutes. samples were then f11tered onto whatman gf/b glass fiber
f i l t e r s which were rapidly washed with a total of 10 ml of iced buffer
added in 4 portions. filters were transferred to vials with 10 ml of
"scintosol", a high efficiency s c i n t i l l a t i o n cocktail, shaken thoroughly,
and allowed to s i t overnight prior to s c i n t i l l a t i o n counting.
all determinations were carried out in t r i p l i c a t e . specific binding
was defined as the difference between total binding and binding in the
presence of 3 ~m unlabelled diazepam.
d) data anal~sis
k. values were determined using the following relationship: k =
ic50/i1 + ([l]/kn)), where ic50 = crncentration of drug necessary ~o
displace 50% of ~pecifically bound vh-diazepam, evaluated from displacement
curves containing 4-6 points equally distributed about the 50% blockade
point, [l] = concentration of radioligand used in the assay, and kd =
dissociation constant as determine~ through eadie-hofstee analysis (16).
for saturation curve experiments, h-diazepamwas used at concentrations
ranging from 0.3 to 33 nm. the data then underwent scatchard analysis
(17). hill coefficients were obtained by plotting displacement curve data
in the form of log [displacer] vs. log (100/%inhibition - i) and
determining the slope of the resultant lines through linear regression
analysis.

the potency of displacement of 3h-diazepam by  xxxd2255xxx  and i t s
3-oh-metabolite, as lndlcated by the lower k. values, was 2-3 times
greater (p<.05, student's t - t e s t ) in cerebellum than in e l t h e r hippocampus
or cortex (table i ) .
in contrast, none of the f l v e 'andard
benzodlazepines tested showed s p e c l f l c i t y for the cerebellum. in f a c t ,
there were s~gnlf~cant changes in the ki's for dlazepam and
desmethyldiazepam in the opposlte d l r e c t i o n , i . e . higher for cerebellum
than for e i t h e r of the other two regions, although the differences were
small and w i l l have to be confirmed in future studies. to our knowledge,
t h l s has not been reported in the l i t e r a t u r e previously but nelther have
similar comparisons been made.
compared to dlazepam, the potency of  xxxd2255xxx  was about 1/30th as
great ~n the cortex, 1/18th as great in hippocampus, and 1/6th as great in
cerebellum. 3-oh- xxxd2255xxx  was weaker than  xxxd2255xxx  in these tissues.

 xxxd1459xxx 's tested were not significantly different from unity (p>.05) in all 3
regions.  xxxd2255xxx  and its 3-oh-metabolite yielded a hill coefficient of
unity only in cerebellum, with hill coefficients significantly (p<.05) less
than unity in cortex and hippocampus.
b) displacement effects of  xxxd3058xxx , its major metabolites, and standard
 xxxd1459xxx  sleep-inducers
the potency of displacement of 3h-diazepam by  xxxd3058xxx  and its
2-oxo-metabolite (table iii-a) was significantly greater (p<o.05 student's
t - t e s t ) , as shown by the lower ki's, in the cerebellum than in either
cortex or the midbrain reticular formation (mrf). the ki for displacement
of h-diazepam by 3-oh-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  in cerebellum and ~fr was lower than
in cortex (p<.o5). the displacement potencies of the metabolities were
significantly greater (p<.05, student's t-test) than  xxxd3058xxx  in all three
tissues. in contrast, no significant regional differences were noted for
the des-trifluoroethyl metabolite of  xxxd3058xxx ,  xxxd2140xxx , nitrazepam or
triazolam.
hill plot analyses of the displacement curves yielded some unexpected
results (table iv-a). quazepamyielded hill coefficients significantly
less (p<.o5, student's t-test) than unity in both cortex and cerebellum.
hill coefficients were significantly less (p<.05, student's t-test) than
unity for 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  in cortex only and for 3-oh-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  in both
cortex and mrf. hill coefficients not different than unity were observed
for all other  xxxd1459xxx 's tested in all three tissues.
four other trifluoroethyl-containing benzodiazepines were also examined
(table iii-b). three of them also showed a higher affinity (p<o.05,

other bzds. this is manifested mainly by their higher a f f i n i t i e s for
binding sites in cerebellum than in cortex. in contrast, none of the ten
standard  xxxd1459xxx  anxiolytics or hypnotics tested which do not contain the
trifluoroethyl moiety had this property. it appears that those
trifluoroethyl  xxxd1459xxx 's showing hill coefficients of unity in the cerebellum
and less than unity in the cortex are discriminating between subpopulations
of  xxxd1459xxx  receptor sites in the cortex. these are the f i r s t benzodiazepines
reported to have this property. literally thousands of bzds studied thus
far have not shown evidence of selectivity for cerebellar sites (17); none
of these compounds contain a trifluoroethyl moiety in the 1-n position. it

the pharmacologic s i g n i f i c a n c e of s e l e c t i v e a f f i n i t y for d i f f e r e n t
subpopulations of  xxxd1459xxx  receptors is not f u l l y understood. the animal
pharmacology of  xxxd2255xxx  ( i ) indicates that t h i s compound has less ataxic
and sedative e f f e c t s than dlazepam or chlordiazepoxide. the s l m i l a r
p r o f i l e seen with the non- xxxd1459xxx  t r a n q u i l i z e r t r i a z o l o p y r i d a z i n e s eg cl 218872
(18) suggests a connection between a c t i v i t y at subpopulations of receptors
and the separation of a n x i o l y t i c e f f e c t s and sedation or e f f e c t s on motor
function.
the i n t e r a c t i o n of  xxxd3058xxx  with  xxxd1459xxx  receptors seems to be more
complex. like  xxxd2255xxx , i t e x h i b i t s a high a f f i n i t y for c e r e b e l l a r s i t e s
and has only weak ataxic e f f e c t s , but, as indicated by the low h i l l
c o e f f i c i e n t s in the cerebellum, i t also seems to discriminate between
subpopulations of  xxxd1459xxx  receptors in t h i s tissue which heretofore was
reported to have mostly (>92%) type i receptors (8). this suggests that
 xxxd3058xxx  probably also acts at another s i t e , perhaps a t h i r d subpopulation
of  xxxd1459xxx  receptors. further work is necessary to c l a m f y t h i s p o s s l b i l i t y .
the data in t h i s report support the p o s s i b i l i t y that binding sites in
one area (eg cerebellum) may be d i s t i n c t l y d l f f e r e n t from those in another
area, a p o s s i b i l l t y f i r s t advanced by gee and yamamura (1982). for
example, bo~h  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  are s i g n i f l c a n t l y more potent in
dlsplacing h-diazepam in cerebellum than in the mrf but t h e i r h i l l
c o e f f l c i e n t s were not d i f f e r e n t from unity in the mrf. the same argument
applles for sch 15698 and sch 15893, both of which are more potent in
cerebellum than cortex but have s i m i l a r h i l l c o e f f i c i e n t s in each of these
t i s s u e s . moreover, another  xxxd1459xxx , 2-oxo-3-oh- xxxd3058xxx , yielded i d e n t l c a l
k ' s for displacement of vh-diazepam in cerebellum and the mrf despite a
h i l l c o e f f i c i e n t not d i f f e r e n t from unity in cerebellum and less than unity
in the mrf.
note: dumng the course of the experlments reported here, i t came to our
a t t e n t i o n that sieghart (22) tested quazqpam, 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , and
3-oh-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  for displacement of ~h-flunitrazepam in rat cerebellum
and hlppocampus, and found s l m l l a r results ie greater a f f i n i t y of these
drugs for bzi receptors.
