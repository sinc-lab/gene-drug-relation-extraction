abstract
administration of formalin in rat paws results in stimulation of nociceptive pathways, which leads to an
increase in the excitability of neurons present in dorsal horn. this increased neuron excitability, described as
central sensitization, may result in development of inflammatory pain at a distant site of injury application,
known as secondary hyperalgesia. the aim of the present study was to verify whether formalin injection in rat
paws would lead to secondary hyperalgesia development, as measured by the tail-flick test. we also aimed to
investigate whether celecoxib, a specific  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitor, would affect secondary
hyperalgesia. formalin injected into the rat paws significantly reduced the latency for a flick response in the rat
tail, which characterized development of secondary hyperalgesia. in addition, formalin-induced secondary
hyperalgesia was locally prevented by pre-but not post-celecoxib treatment. however, celecoxib administered
spinally inhibited formalin-induced secondary hyperalgesia, either administered previously or following
formalin. in contrast,  xxxd2969xxx , an unspecific cox inhibitor which displays an increased selectivity towards
cox-1, only prevented secondary hyperalgesia to formalin at a high dose following spinal administration.
taken together, these results suggest that cox-2 plays an important role both in the central and in the
peripheral nerve sensitization following formalin administration in rat paws. they also suggested that once
central sensitization starts it can no longer be blocked by a specific cox-2 inhibitor administered locally.

introduction
continuous peripheral stimulation of nociceptive pathways can produce an increase in the
excitability of dorsal horn neurons. this phenomenon, termed central sensitization, can be
triggered by some conditions such as heat injury (kenshalo et al., 1992) arthritis (menétrey and
besson, 1982; neugebauer and schaible, 1990) and subcutaneous injection of irritants, e.g.
carrageenan (ren et al., 1992) and formalin (malmberg and yaksh, 1992a). local tissue injury
or inflammation may induce development of an increased response to noxious stimulation, which
is known as primary hyperalgesia (burgess and perl, 1967). however, when continuous longlasting nociceptive stimulation occurs, and a hyperalgesic state develops distant from the site of
primary injury, it is referred to as secondary hyperalgesia (hardy et al., 1950). sensitization of
central nervous system may play a role in secondary hyperalgesia development (hardy et al.,
1950).
according to (wiertelak et al., 1994), formalin injection evokes the spinal release of excitatory
amino acid (eaa) transmitters and  xxxg2240xxx  (sp). glutamate and sp, acting at specific receptors in
the dorsal horn cells, exert their effects through activation of several intracellular processes, including
prostaglandin synthesis and release. at the extracellular space, prostaglandins can enhance neural
excitability and give rise to secondary hyperalgesia (mccormack, 1994).
prostaglandins (ferreira and nakamura, 1978) as well as cyclooxygenases (coxs) have been
implicated in the development of hyperalgesia. so far, different isoforms of cox have been
identified in the literature: the constitutively expressed cox-1, the inducible cox-2, which is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli (vane et al., 1998; feng et al., 1993), and more
recently, a third isoform (cox-3) has been described in the dog brain (chandrasekharan et al.,
2002). both cox-1 and cox-2 are constitutively expressed in the spinal cord, although cox-2
appears to be the most common isoform present at this location (beiche et al., 1996). rat paw
inflammation due to complete freund adjuvant produces a time-dependent increase in cox-2
mrna in the lumbar spinal cord, a key site for sensory transmission (samad et al., 2001).
according to (struebe and beiche, 1997), the increased cox-2 mrna levels which develops
spinally under peripheral painful inflammatory stimulation may suggest spinal cox-2 as the
responsible for nociceptive processing.
in the present study we aimed (1) to verify whether formalin would induce secondary hyperalgesia
in rats under our experimental conditions, (2) to determine the role of cox-2 on the development of
this secondary hyperalgesia, as measured by tail-flick test, and finally (3) to determine the location of
cox-2 activity, whether peripheral and/or spinal, by the use of a specific cox-2 inhibitor, celecoxib
(vane et al., 1998).

materials and methods
animals
male wistar rats weighing 160–190 g were used throughout the study. animals were housed in a
temperature-controlled room (23 f 1 8c) on a 12 h light/dark cycle and with free access to food and
water. all experiments were conducted during the light part of the cycle. twenty-four h before test, the
animals were subjected to a contact with apparatus (analgesimeter) in order to minimize stress during the
experiments. all procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the local ethics committee
(federal university of minas gerais), which in essence followed the ethical guidelines from the
international association for the study of pain in conscious animals (zimmerman, 1983).
formalin preparation and injection
a 5% formalin solution was prepared from a mixture of 37% formaldehyde and sterile physiological
saline. fifty microlitres (al) from a 5% formalin solution were injected subcutaneously in the plantar
surface of the left hind paw at time zero. control animals received the same volume of saline in
ipsilateral pads.
tail-flick test
ten minutes after formalin administration, the animals were submitted to tail-flick (tf) test, using a
modification of the procedure developed previously (d’amour and smith, 1941). this modification has
been published elsewhere (tatsuo et al., 1997). in brief, hyperalgesia was defined as a decrease in the
latency for rats to withdraw their tails from a noxious radiant heat source (tf latency). response was
observed over a period of 70 min following formalin administration, in 10-min intervals, similarly to the
work by (wiertelak et al., 1994; watkins et al., 1997). baseline responses (bl) were established between
4 to 6 s, to both control and test animals, with a cut-off time of stimulation at 9 s to prevent tissue
damage. in order to analyze data, the tail-flick index (tfi) was calculated by the following formula:
tfi ¼

tflatency  bl
9  bl

to ease comparison of data in different animal groups tfi results were also transformed to area under
the curve (auc). negative values for tfi or auc indicate a hyperalgesic state or its attenuation while
positive values indicate hypoalgesia development or analgesia.
drugs and routes of administration
peripheral effect of celecoxib, a specific cox-2 inhibitor, was assessed by ipsilateral or contralateral
intraplantar (i.pl.) injection (in 20 al), 10 min before or 7 min after formalin administration. spinal
effects of celecoxib and the opioid antagonist naloxone (in 10 al) were assessed using the intratechal
route of administration before or following formalin administration, according to the method described
in (mestre et al., 1994). in this method, the rat was firmly held in one hand by the pelvic girdle and a 30gauge hypodermic needle was inserted in the tissues between the dorsal aspects of l5 and l6,

2810

a.p.c. veiga et al. / life sciences 75 (2004) 2807–2817

perpendicular to the vertebral column. when the needle entered the subarachnoidal space, a sudden
lateral movement of the tail was observed. only animals that did not show motor disturbances after any
injection were studied. celecoxib was also administered orally by gavage (final volume of 1 ml/animal).
control animals were injected with the same volume of celecoxib vehicle (saline+dmso). some
animals were treated with  xxxd2969xxx , either injected i.pl. or i.t., as for celecoxib.
drug sources and dilutions
celecoxib (celebrar-searle/pfizer, porto rico) and naloxone (sigma, usa) were diluted in 0.9%
saline (nacl).  xxxd2969xxx  ( xxxd2969xxx , pfizer ltda, brazil) was diluted in physiological saline and in 60%
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)/saline, respectively. some animals were treated with  xxxd2969xxx , an
unspecific cox inhibitor which displays increased selectivity towards cox-1, either injected i.pl. or i.t.,
as for celecoxib.
data analysis
results are expressed by the mean values f standard error of the means (s.e.m) for n = 6 in each
group. to ease data analysis, temporal determinations of the tail-flick index were transformed to area
under the curves (auc) for all figures. statistical analysis was carried out by one-way analysis of
variance (anova). statistical significance between two groups was calculated using mann-whitney
test and for multiple comparisons kruskal-wallis test followed by student-newman-keuls test were
used. the significance level was set at pb0.05 given by the sigma stat software (version 1.199).

results
subcutaneous injection of 5% formalin into the hind paw induced a decrease in the tail-flick index
(tfi), indicating development of secondary hyperalgesia. this hyperalgesia increased progressively
reaching a maximum value at 30 min. after 70 min of injection, the hyperalgesic effect returned to the
basal level, whereas tfi from control (saline-injected) animals did not vary during 70 min of observation
(fig. 1a), remaining at the basal level all through the experiments. the same results are presented as area
under the curves (auc) in fig. 1b, which eased comparison of data between groups. for this reason, all
data were subsequently transformed to auc.
doses of 200 and 400 ag celecoxib ipl, 10 min before formalin dose-dependently reduced the
decrease in auc induced by 5% formalin, while the effect of 100 ag was not different from the control
group (fig. 2). a dose of 400 ag was effective to totally prevent the development of secondary
hyperalgesia and higher doses (800 ag) did not increase further this inhibition (data not shown). in
contrast, when administered locally (in the paw) 7 min after formalin, celecoxib did not inhibit the
development of secondary hyperalgesia anymore (fig. 2). in addition, a dose of 400 ag celecoxib
previously administered into the contralateral paw did not prevent the hyperalgesic effect (data not
shown), indicating that the blockade derived from a local effect.
however, celecoxib (ccx) administered by intrathecal route at doses of 11 and 22 ag produced a
hypoalgesic effect dose-dependently, while 5.5 ag of celecoxib only inhibited the development of
hyperalgesia. intrathecal celecoxib (5.5 ag) was also efficient to inhibit the formalin-induced secondary

analgesic response, here described as a hypoalgesic effect, was induced by intratechal administration of
celecoxib. this hypoalgesia was fully reverted by an effective dose of the opioid antagonist (10 ag)

doses (40 mg/kg) did not induce extra inhibition, while a dose of 10 mg/kg was inefficient to induce any
anti-hyperalgesic effect (fig 5).
in contrast to celecoxib,  xxxd2969xxx  administered intraplantarly 10 min before formalin did not prevent
development of secondary hyperalgesia. however, only a dose of 100 ag partially prevented the
development of secondary hyperalgesia, when  xxxd2969xxx  was intrathecally administered 10 min before
formalin (fig. 6).

discussion
in the present study we demonstrated that formalin injected in the paw can induce hyperalgesia in the
rat tail. this hyperalgesia detected far from the primary injured site was denominated secondary
hyperalgesia. according to (coderre et al., 1993), secondary hyperalgesia depends, in part, on a central
sensitization process, which at the spinal cord level, seems to be mediated by the release of excitatory
amino acids (eaas) and nmda receptors activation (wiertelak et al., 1994). behavioral and
eletrophysiological studies have indicated that spinal cyclooxygenase products, i.e., prostaglandins are
involved in the nociceptive effect of formalin (malmberg and yaksh, 1992a; chapman and dickenson,
1992). in fact, increase in prostaglandin levels following formalin administration has been demonstrated
by (scheuren et al., 1997) and recently, (park et al., 2000) suggested that pge2 may act as a retrograde
messenger in the eaas-induced spinal hyperalgesia.
based on such findings, we have examined whether secondary hyperalgesia resulting from formalininduced central sensitization would derive from the activity of cox-2 isoform, so far the main enzyme
responsible for prostaglandin formation during inflammatory conditions (vane et al., 1998). additionally, we have also investigated the possible sites of cox-2 activation, whether occurring peripherally or
in the central nervous system.
we have observed that intraplantar injection of celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of cox-2 isoform,
before but not after formalin administration, completely inhibited development of secondary
hyperalgesia. such finding suggested that products of cox-2 were released in the injected paw
immediately after formalin injection, because the intraplantar post-formalin administration of celecoxib
was ineffective in preventing such hyperalgesia. in accordance, local (intraplantar) or still spinal
administration of celecoxib previously to formalin also inhibited development of secondary hyperalgesia. this suggestion is supported by earlier findings from (moncada et al., 1975), who established
that prostaglandin synthesis induced by formalin could sensitize peripheral nociceptors located at the site
of inflammation, so facilitating the activation of c-fiber terminals. continuous activation of such
terminals would produce functional changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (coderre et al., 1990;
tflsen et al., 1992), which could culminate in facilitation of spinal pain conduction. furthermore, the
failure of the post-treatment with local (peripheral) celecoxib to prevent the development of secondary
hyperalgesia as shown in this study fits in the proposal by (coderre et al., 1993), who suggested that
once activated central sensitization becomes independent of continuity of peripheral inputs. this was
later confirmed by local anesthetic doses of lidocaine after formalin administration to experimental
animals, whose secondary hyperalgesia still remained (data not shown). so, for secondary hyperalgesia
to develop it is critical that initial inputs from the injured site do reach the spinal cord. however, once it
is reached, inputs from the injured peripheral tissue are no longer necessary. the fact that spinal posttreatment with celecoxib blocked hyperalgesia is in accordance with many other studies using cox

2815

inhibitors (malmberg and yaksh, 1992a; malmberg and yaksh, 1992b; zhang et al., 1997) and suggested
that prostanoid turnover must be relatively rapid and continuous in the animal spinal cord under
peripheral inflammation.
when celecoxib was administered intrathecally to the animals, both doses (11 and 22 ag) produced an
analgesic response, here described as a hypoalgesic effect. i.e., celecoxib-treated animals not only
presented lack of secondary hyperalgesia to formalin but also presented an increased threshold to flick
their tails. a hypoalgesic response associated with use of specific cox-2 inhibitors has already been
demonstrated by our group using carrageenan as the experimental model to induce hyperalgesia
development (francischi et al., 2002). surprisingly in the present study, animals which were injected
spinally with a combination of celecoxib and naloxone, a full opioid antagonist, did not present this
hypoalgesic effect. the existence of a link between the actions of nsaids (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) and the opioid system in the mediation of antinociception has been suggested by
many authors in the literature. for instance, (herrero and headley, 1995) studying the nsaid flunixin
concluded that its antinociceptive effect was mediated by endogenous opioids released in the spinal cord.
for these authors, presumably nsaids increased the release of endogenous opioid peptides that occurs
tonically under conditions of acute inflammation. according to (malmberg and yaksh, 1992b), the
increase of prostaglandin release would counteract the suppressive (inhibitory) effect of opioids. thus,
the blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by nsaids would substantially enhance the potency of the
endogenous opioid system.
discovery of mechanisms involved in the central sensitization process which occurs during
(peripheral) inflammatory conditions is of paramount importance to prevent development of such a
phenomenon, thus reducing substantially the hypersensitivity that follows many situations such as those
which occur following surgical procedures. clinically, intrathecal or even local administration of
analgesic drugs are not usual. therefore, we have investigated the systemic action of celecoxib in
preventing development of secondary hyperalgesia through its oral administration in the formalin
method. a dose of 20 mg/kg of oral celecoxib totally prevented development of formalin-induced
secondary hyperalgesia, an effect which was also reverted by intrathecal but not a local naloxone
treatment (data not shown). this further suggest specific cox-2 inhibitors could be useful as presurgical treatments in order to prevent central sensitization.
 xxxd2969xxx  is a classical example of unspecific nsaid which inhibits the cox-1 isoform
preferentially being 600-fold more selective towards the cox-1 isoform (vane et al., 1998). we
showed in the present study that neither local nor intratechal administration of  xxxd2969xxx , except in a
very high dose compared with celecoxib, was effective to prevent formalin-induced secondary
hyperalgesia. this result further reinforces our working hypothesis that the cox-2 is the predominant
isoform involved in the central sensitisation process. indeed, the partial anti-hyperalgesic effect observed
when a high dose (100 ag) of  xxxd2969xxx  was administrated by intrathecal route in the secondary
hyperalgesia due to formalin can also be explained by its inhibitory activity on cox-2 isoform.
in conclusion, our results demonstrated through the use of celecoxib, a standard cox-2 inhibitor,
that cox-2 isoform plays an important role in the central sensitization derived from a peripheral
inflammation, both at the local and at the spinal level. moreover, these data suggest that once the
process begins, peripheral (local) inhibition of cox-2 no longer affects its development. however,
spinal blockade of this enzyme still is efficient in preventing the maintenance of central sensitization.
taken together our data suggest that both 1) prostaglandins play an important role in the induction and
maintenance of the hyperalgesic state peripherally and centrally, and 2) prevention of their production/

release by specific cox-2 inhibitors might be explored with further analgesic purposes, such as in
pre-anesthesia.
