abstract

background the thrombotic process is a multicellular phenomenon in which not only
platelets but also neutrophils are involved. recent in vitro studies performed in our
laboratory have demonstrated that tri¯usal, a 4-tri¯uoromethyl derivative of salicylate,
reduced platelet aggregation not only by inhibiting thromboxane a2 production but also
by stimulating  xxxd2738xxx  (no) generation by neutrophils. the aim of the present study was
to evaluate whether oral treatment of healthy volunteers with tri¯usal could modify the
ability of their neutrophils to produce no and to test the role of the no released by
neutrophils in the modulation of adp-induced platelet aggregation and a-granule secretion.
methods the study was performed in 12 healthy volunteers who were orally treated
with tri¯usal (600 mg day 1) for 5 days. flow cytometric detection of platelet surface
expression of  xxxg2049xxx  was used as a measure of the ability of platelets to release the
contents of their a-granules.
results after treatment with tri¯usal, there was an increase in no production by neutrophils and an increase in  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  (enos) protein expression in
neutrophils. a potentiation of the inhibition of platelet aggregation by neutrophils was
reversed by incubating neutrophils with both an l-arginine antagonist, ng-nitro-l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name) and an no scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline 1-oxyl 3-oxide (c-ptio). a slight decrease in  xxxg2049xxx  surface expression
on platelets was found which was not modi®ed by the presence of neutrophils and therefore
by the neutrophil-derived no. exogenous no released by sodium nitroprusside dosedependently inhibited both adp-stimulated a-granule secretion and platelet aggregation.
therefore, platelet aggregation showed a greater sensitivity to be inhibited by exogenous no
than  xxxg2049xxx  expression.
conclusion oral treatment of healthy volunteers with tri¯usal stimulated no production
and enos protein expression in their neutrophils. after tri¯usal treatment, the neutrophils
demonstrated a higher ability to prevent adp-induced platelet aggregation. however, the
neutrophils and the endogenous no generated by them failed to modify  xxxg2049xxx 
expression in adp-activated platelets.

introduction
during the last years, the thrombotic process has been
considered as a multicellular phenomenon in which platelets, neutrophils and the endothelium are implicated [1].
therefore, new agents released from these cells have
been involved in the regulation of platelet activation. in
this regard, there is evidence showing that two vasodilating
mediators produced by endothelial cells and neutrophils
[ xxxd2738xxx  (no) and prostacyclin (pgi2)] have synergistic

812

l. s. de miguel et al.

anti-platelet effects mediated by  xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp)- and
camp-related systems, respectively [2,3].
the inhibition of platelet activation has been the focus of
several pharmacological strategies in the prevention and
treatment of thrombotic events.  xxxd234xxx 
remains a cornerstone in these preventive and damagelimiting strategies [4]. however, several compounds have
been developed to improve the ef®cacy of acetylsalicylic
acid [5].
tri¯usal (2-acetoxy-4-tri¯uoromethylbenzoic acid) is
one of these new anti-platelet drugs. the main difference
between tri¯usal and  xxxd234xxx  resides in the
ability of the de-acetylated metabolite of tri¯usal, 2hydroxy-4-tri¯uoromethylbenzoic acid (htb) to inhibit
camp phosphodiesterase activity. this effect was not
seen with the de-acetylated metabolite of acetylsalicylic
acid,  xxxd3159xxx  [6].
the inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity by
tri¯usal does not fully explain the antithrombotic effect of
this drug. in this regard, it has been reported that tri¯usal
has a greater platelet-inactivating effect in the presence of
leukocytes [7]. we recently demonstrated that tri¯usal
reduced platelet aggregation in vitro via an increase in
no production by human neutrophils [7,8].
as mentioned above, cellular homeostasis in the blood
not only includes homotypic (platelet±platelet) interactions, but also heterotypic cell±platelet interactions.
within the context of heterotypic cell interactions, i.e.
platelet±neutrophil,  xxxg2049xxx  has a relevant role.  xxxg2049xxx 
is present in the internal membrane of the a-granule in
resting platelets and it is mobilized to the plasma membrane after platelet activation [9,10]. although it has been
reported that different no donors decrease a-granule
secretion by activated platelets, some evidence seems to
indicate that cyclooxygenase inhibitors do not modify agranule secretion, and therefore  xxxg2049xxx  expression, in
platelets [11,12]. however, it remains to be addressed
if the in vivo administration of tri¯usal increases the ability
of neutrophils to produce no and to reduce platelet
activation in terms of platelet aggregation and a-granule
secretion.

materials and methods
chemicals
 xxxd3253xxx ±hypaque medium was obtained from flow laboratories (madrid, spain). l-arginine, ng-nitro-l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name) and sodium nitroprusside (snp)
were purchased from sigma chemicals (st louis,
mo).both 3h-labelled l-arginine and the cgmp radioinmmunoassay kit were purchased from amersham
(buckinghamshire, uk). adp was purchased from
chrono-log (havertown, pa). fluorescein isothiocyanatelabelled anti-human  xxxg1202xxx /iiia antibody was purchased
from dako (glostrup, denmark) and phycoerythrinlabelled anti-human  xxxg2049xxx  antibody ( xxxg2049xxx ) was

obtained from becton-dickinson (san joseâ, california).
all other chemicals were of the highest commercially
available quality from sigma.
experimental protocol
the study was performed in a group of 12 healthy male
volunteers (30 6 6 years) who had not previously been
taken any medication for at least 20 days prior to the
experiments.
trifusal (600 mg day 1; one oral morning dose) was
administered for 5 days. blood samples were obtained by
peripheral venopuncture before tri¯usal treatment (basal
value) and on the 5th day 1 h after the last administration.
this time was chosen because it is the time at which
tri¯usal has been shown to reach its maximum plasma
concentration [13].
all volunteers gave written informed consent. the protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the
institutional ethics committee and the investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the declaration of
helsinki.
neutrophil isolation
human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood by
 xxxd3253xxx ±hypaque centrifugation as previously described
[14]. neutrophils (95% pure, 98% viable by trypan blue
exclusion) were resuspended in ca2 physiological saline
solution (pss) containing: 140 mmol l 1 nacl,
4´6 mmol l 1 kcl, 2´0 mmol l 1 cacl2, 1´0 mmol l 1
mgcl2, 5´0 mmol l 1 d-glucose and 10´0 mmol l 1
hepes, ph 7´4.
platelet-rich plasma preparation and platelet
aggregation
platelet-rich plasma (prp) was obtained from the same
volunteer as the neutrophils for each experiment and prepared as previously described [8]. brie¯y, whole blood was
obtained in 10% (v/v) acid±citrate±dextrose mixture
(l40 mmol sodium citrate, 11´8 mmol  xxxd1710xxx , 18 mmol
dextrose) and centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. 120 g for 15 min.
prp was collected and the platelets were counted in a
coulter counter. the platelet number was adjusted with
platelet-poor plasma obtained from the same donor
to 1´2 ´ 108 cells ml 1 plasma. platelet activation was
monitored with a two-channel aggregometer (chronolog, havertown, pa) by measuring the change in light
transmission.
platelet-poor plasma was used as control (100% light
transmission). to correct for the possible light absorption
induced by the presence of the neutrophil suspension,
platelet-poor plasma contained an equal number of
neutrophils as the sample.
prp (500 ml) was incubated at 37 8c for 10 min in the

q 2000 blackwell science ltd, european journal of clinical investigation, 30, 811±817

tri¯usal and no in human neutrophils

aggregometer with continous stirring (1000 r.p.m. 120 g)
and then stimulated with adp (10 5 mol l 1). five minutes before stimulation, 20 ml of the neutrophil suspension
was added to prp to obtain a ®nal ratio of platelets to
neutrophils of (125 : 1) which is approximately the relative
ratio of these cells in normal blood. to determine the
involvement of no in the effects of neutrophils on platelets, neutrophils were preincubated with the no synthase
inhibitor, l-name (10 4 mol l 1), 30 min before the
experiments were performed. the l-name-treated neutrophils were washed before being added to the platelets. in
addition, an no scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5
tetramethylimidazoline
1-oxyl
3-oxide
(c-ptio,
3 ´ 10 5 mol l 1), was added to the platelet±neutrophil
suspension 5 min before adp stimulation.
to standardize the results, only the values of turbidimetry at 5 min were used for calculations. this time period
corresponds to the plateau of the maximum value of the
®rst wave of platelet aggregation.
determination of 3h-labelled  xxxd2429xxx  content
as detailed elsewhere [8,14], isolated neutrophils were
counted and incubated for 45 min at 37 8c in pss-ca2
containing 10 4 mol l 1 l-arginine and 1 mci ml 1 3hlabelled l-arginine (41 ci mmol 1 speci®c activity). unincorporated 3h-labelled l-arginine was washed out twice
with the same buffer. the experiments were performed by
incubating 3 ´ 106 neutrophils per sample for 10 min at
37 8c.
after incubation, the neutrophils were lysed with
cold ethanol and the supernatants were collected and
evaporated until dryness under n2 atmosphere. as previously described [8,14], the extracts were resuspended
in 20 mmol l 1 hepes/koh, ph 5´5, and applied to
columns of dowex ag50wx8 (na form) which were
subsequently eluted with water ( xxxd2429xxx  fraction) and
0´5 mol l 1 naoh (l-arginine fraction). the 3h-labelled
citrulline fraction was quanti®ed by liquid-scintillation
counting. this column method separates l-arginine from
 xxxd2429xxx  by up to 92 6 3%.
western-blot analysis.
expression of  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  (enos)
protein was analysed in human neutrophils by western
blotting. after neutrophil isolation, the neutrophils were
lysed in laemmli buffer containing  xxxd26xxx 
[15]. the proteins were separated on denaturing sodium
dodecyl sulphate (sds)±10% polyacrylamide gels (15 mg
per lane) and blocked overnight at 4 8c with 5% nonfat dry
milk in tbs-t (20 mmol l 1 tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, 137 mmol l 1 nacl, 0´1% tween-20) as
described [16]. western blot analysis was performed with
a monoclonal antibody against enos (transduction
laboratories, lexington, uk). blots were incubated with
the ®rst antibody (1 : 2500) for 1 h at room temperature

813

and, after extensive washing, with the second antibody
(horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody) at a dilution of 1 : 1500 for a further 1 h.
speci®c enos protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl, amersham iberica, madrid, spain)
and evaluated by densitometry (molecular dynamics,
sunnyvale, ca). prestained protein markers were used
for molecular mass determinations.
to assess the speci®city of the enos monoclonal antibody, we analysed the cross-reactivity of the antibody
against the neuronal  xxxd2738xxx  synthase ( xxxg1577xxx ) isoform
with a homogenate of rat pituitary and against the inducible
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase ( xxxg1578xxx ) isoform expressed in homogenates of lps-treated human macrophages.
expression of  xxxg2049xxx 
platelets were incubated in the presence and in the absence
of neutrophils (125 : 1) and stimulated with adp for 5 min
at 37 8c. the cells were ®xed overnight in 1% paraformaldehyde. the ®xed cells were then washed three
times, resuspended in pss-ca2 solution and used for
cyto¯uorometric analysis.
to detect  xxxg2049xxx -positive cells, the samples were
incubated with a monoclonal anti- xxxg2049xxx  antibody for
30 min at room temperature. the samples were analysed in
a ¯uorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) ¯ow cytometer
(becton-dickinson san joseâ, ca) as described [17]. a
minimum of 10 000 cells was analysed for each sample.
neutrophils were excluded by a combination of size and
platelet-speci®c marker (anti- xxxg1202xxx /iiia) gating.
mean  xxxg2049xxx -positive ¯uorescence for the entire
platelet population was expressed in arbitrary ¯uorescence
units. the percentage of cells positive for  xxxg2049xxx 
was generated by substracting an isotype control (mouse
phycoerythrin-labelled igg1).
statistical methods
the results are expressed as mean 6 standard error of
the mean (sem). to determine the statistical signi®cance
of our results, we used a two-tailed analysis of variance
(anova) with bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons. a p-value < 0´05 was considered statistically
signi®cant.

generation by neutrophils was markedly
increased (fig. 1a). in the presence of l-name
(10 4 mol l 1), the conversion of 3h-labelled l-arginine
into 3h-labelled  xxxd2429xxx  was inhibited by 85 6 4%
both before and after tri¯usal treatment, indicating the
speci®city of the reaction.
the modi®cations of enos protein synthesis by oral
tri¯usal treatment were further analysed by western blotting. neutrophils obtained after 5 days of tri¯usal administration showed a signi®cant increase in enos protein
expression with respect to the levels found before (fig. 1b).
as previously reported [16,18], the monoclonal antibody
used to detect the 140-kda enos isoform reacted with a
positive control obtained from human umbilical vein
endothelial cells, while it failed to recognize a band in homogenates from rat pituitary and lipopolysaccharide-treated
human macrophages.

observed which was markedly potentiated by neutrophils
(fig. 2).

we determined  xxxg2049xxx  expression in platelets incubated
alone and in the presence of neutrophils (1´25 ´ 108 platelets: 1 ´ 106 neutrophils). to reproduce the conditions
of the platelet aggregation experiments, platelets were
stimulated with adp (10 5 mol l 1). adp-stimulated pselectin expression in platelets (%  xxxg2049xxx  expression:

before tri¯usal administration, the presence of neutrophils
did not modify adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression (fig.

lower adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression (fig. 3). in contrast to the aggregation experiments, after oral tri¯usal
administration, the presence of neutrophils failed to
modify  xxxg2049xxx  expression in adp-stimulated platelets
(fig. 3). neither the presence of l-name-incubated

effect of exogenous no on platelet aggregation and
 xxxg2049xxx  expression
several studies have previously established that no donors
decrease  xxxg2049xxx  expression in activated platelets. however, in the present study we have found a different effect of
neutrophil-derived no on platelet aggregation and agranule secretion. as shown in fig. 4(a), the addition of
an no-donor, snp, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of
adp-stimulated platelet aggregation. we found that the
different snp doses used to diminish platelet aggregation
starting from 10 9 mol l 1 produced a signi®cant inhibition
of platelet aggregation (fig. 4a). exogenous snp also prevented adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression (fig. 4b). the
threshold dose for snp to reduce  xxxg2049xxx  expression was
10 7 mol l 1 which was higher than that required for platelet aggregation (10 9 mol l 1) (fig. 4a,b). the same dose of
snp produced a sign®cantly higher inhibition of platelet
aggregation than of  xxxg2049xxx  expression (fig. 4a,b).

discussion
the present results demonstrate that oral administration
of tri¯usal, a new  xxxd234xxx -related compound,
stimulates no production, measured as 3h-labelled lcitrulline formation by human neutrophils. the enhanced
synthesis of no by neutrophils related to tri¯usal administration reduced platelet aggregation. in contrast to platelet aggregation, the effect of tri¯usal on a-granule secretion
was unrelated to the presence of neutrophils and neutrophil-derived no. in a previous study performed in vitro, we

demonstrated that tri¯usal stimulated no generation by
neutrophils [8]. the present study, using blood from
human volunteers under oral tri¯usal treatment, demonstrates the in vivo relevance of the previously described
in vitro ®ndings.
to obtain further insight into the mechanisms leading to
the increase in no production by human neutrophils
associated with tri¯usal treatment, we determined the
expression of enos protein in the neutrophils before and
after tri¯usal treatment. functional evidence has previously demonstrated the ability of neutrophils to produce
no through a constitutively expressed  xxxg1578xxx  [19,20]. oral
tri¯usal treatment increased the expression of enos protein in human neutrophils. in the endothelium the enos
isoform had been initially described as constitutive; however, in the last few years some evidence has demonstrated
that several stimuli modulate enos protein expression in
endothelial cells [21,22]. therefore, it is not surprising that
modi®cations of enos expression could also occur in
human neutrophils. the present study demonstrates, at
the molecular level, the presence in human neutrophils of
an endothelial-like  xxxg1578xxx . the expression of enos has been
identi®ed not only in the endothelium but also in other
blood cells. in this regard, berkels et al. [23] have demonstrated that platelets express the enos isoform. moreover,

q 2000 blackwell science ltd, european journal of clinical investigation, 30, 811±817

816

l. s. de miguel et al.

roman et al. [24] have suggested that the constitutively
expressed  xxxg1578xxx  isoform in monocytes/macrophages is of
the endothelial type. nevertheless, we can rule out that in
our preparations the presence of enos protein was related
to contamination with other blood cells because neutrophil
preparations were 97% pure.
the present experimental design did not allow us
to elucidate the mechanism by which tri¯usal could upregulate enos protein expression in human neutrophils.
tri¯usal and its main metabolite, htb, show camp
phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity. interestingly, the
enos gene promoter contains a camp-response element
[25]. moreover, ravichandran and johns have recently
reported that cgmp stimulated enos protein expression
in cultured endothelial cells [26]. human neutrophils also
possess soluble  xxxg1587xxx  activity and the no
generated by neutrophils could act on themselves [27]
and therefore increase cgmp and stimulate enos protein
expression. further studies beyond the scope of the present
research are needed to con®rm these hypotheses.
the experiments concerning platelet activation provided
functional implications of the changes in the ability of
tri¯usal to stimulate no production by neutrophils. the
no-dependent anti-platelet-aggregating effects of tri¯usal
together with its effects on neutrophils were ®rst suggested
by the lack of this effect in l-name-incubated neutrophils.
moreover, an no scavenger, c-ptio, also reverted the
anti-platelet-aggregating effects of neutrophils.
in a second set of experiments, we analysed the effect of
tri¯usal on a-granule platelet secretion associated with pselectin surface expression.  xxxg2049xxx  is localized in the
platelet a-granules and is secreted in the early phase of
platelet activation [9]. therefore, we can associate pselectin expression on the platelet surface with a-granule
secretion.
previous studies, most of them performed in vitro,
have shown the failure of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, i.e.
 xxxd234xxx , to prevent  xxxg2049xxx  expression in
activated platelets [11,12]. however, several studies have
established that no donors reduced a-granule secretion by
activated platelets [28]. therefore, we determined the
effect of no generated by neutrophils on  xxxg2049xxx  expression in activated platelets. adp induced a signi®cant
increase in the percentage of platelets expressing  xxxg2049xxx .
tri¯usal treatment inhibited  xxxg2049xxx  expression on
platelets, although the presence of neutrophils failed to
modify adp-induced platelet a-granule secretion. moreover, both the inhibition of no production using lname-incubated neutrophils and the action of endogenous no by adding an no scavenger, c-ptio, failed
to modify  xxxg2049xxx  expression in adp-stimulated platelets co-incubated with neutrophils. these results suggested
that neutrophil-derived no was unable to modify  xxxg2049xxx 
expression in activated platelets. we then determined
whether exogenous no could prevent  xxxg2049xxx  expression in adp-stimulated platelets. increasing doses of
snp, an no-donor, reduced  xxxg2049xxx  expression in
adp-stimulated human platelets. this ®nding was at
least surprising since, while exogenous no could inhibit

 xxxg2049xxx  expression in activated platelets, neutrophilderived no showed no effect. the present design did not
allow us to answer the question about why no endogenously generated by neutrophils does not modify agranule secretion by platelets. we could not rule out the
possibility that the level of no produced by human neutrophils could be not enough to prevent  xxxg2049xxx  expression.
in this sense, platelet aggregation showed a greater sensitivity to inhibition by exogenous no than a-granule secretion. another interesting aspect of the present results is the
different regulation of platelet secretion and platelet aggregation by neutrophils, suggesting that both processes are
independent. in this sense, gerrard and white have
demonstrated that a-granule secretion by activated platelets
also occurs in the absence of platelet aggregation [29].
the main limitation of the present results is that the
study was performed in platelets and neutrophils from
healthy donors. the behaviour of neutrophils and platelets
from patients with acute coronary syndromes may be
different from that found in normal volunteers. in this
regard, tri¯usal has demonstrated ef®cacy in a number of
cardiovascular diseases associated with platelet activation,
including myocardial infarction [30]. therefore, further
studies are needed to assess the importance of these
mechanisms in platelets and neutrophils from patients
undergoing acute coronary syndromes. moreover, since
tri¯usal is closely related to and often compared with
aspirin, it should also be investigated whether the effects
of tri¯usal/htb analysed in the present study are speci®c
to this drug or are also shared by aspirin/ xxxd3159xxx . in
this regard, in previous in vitro studies we demonstrated
that both aspirin and tri¯usal stimulated  xxxd2429xxx  formation by human neutrophils [8,21]. however, we and others
have reported that tri¯usal/htb but not aspirin/salicylic
acid, inhibited camp and cgmp phosphodiesterase activities favouring the anti-platelet-aggregating effect of no
and prostacyclin [8,31].
in summary, our study demonstrates that oral tri¯usal
administration stimulates  xxxd2429xxx  formation, as an
index of no synthesis, and enos protein expression by
human neutrophils. moreover, after tri¯usal treatment, the
neutrophils demonstrated a higher ability to prevent adpinduced platelet aggregation. however, platelet a-granule
secretion was not modi®ed by neutrophils. while no
derived from neutrophils reduced adp-stimulated platelet
aggregation, the regulation of  xxxg2049xxx  expression was
unchanged by the presence of neutrophils and by the no
generated by these cells. a better knowledge of the
mechanisms of action of the anti-platelet drugs may
lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies
in the prevention and treatment of acute coronary
syndromes.
