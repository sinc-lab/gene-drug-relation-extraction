late numerous biological processes, including mesoderm formation, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis in vivo (2). since the fgf
prototypes are characterized by the lack of a classical signal
peptide sequence to provide access to the conventional endoplasmic reticulum-golgi secretion pathway, it has been suggested that the release of both  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  may proceed
through a novel release pathway (3). our laboratory recently
demonstrated that  xxxg786xxx  is released as a reducing agent- and
denaturant-sensitive complex, containing the p40 extravesicular domain of p65 synaptotagmin (syt) 1 in vitro (4, 5) and that
 xxxg786xxx , p40 syt1, and  xxxg2004xxx  are components of a heparin
binding complex in vivo (1).
it is well established that several members of the s100 gene
family are associated with the cytoskeleton (6, 7) and that the
actin cytoskeleton is essential in transmembrane signaling,
endocytosis, and secretion (8). there is also increasing evidence
that actin microfilaments and the subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton are involved in several aspects of vesicle transport (9).
indeed, in yeast, actin cytoskeleton mutants accumulate large
secretory vesicles and exhibit defects in endocytosis that correlate with changes in actin-polarized organization (10). the
actin cytoskeleton is also required by mammalian cells for cell
proliferation, motility, and morphological changes (8).
the src pathway also plays a central role in the modulation
of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to
extracellular stimuli through the phosphorylation of several
actin-binding proteins including cortactin (11, 12). indeed, the
activation of the src pathway correlates with the induction of
cell migration and the redistribution of cortactin and f-actin,
in response to  xxxg786xxx  (13).
since (i)  xxxd157xxx  is an inhibitor of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1
release in vitro (1), (ii) this reagent binds  xxxg2004xxx , a member
of the heparin binding complex containing p40 syt1 and  xxxg786xxx 
(1, 14), and (iii) members of the s100 gene family are involved
in the regulation of cytoskeletal function (6, 7), we examined
the effect of  xxxd157xxx  on cell morphology, migration, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization. we report that  xxxd157xxx  induces a src-dependent phosphorylation of cortactin that
may be responsible for the reversible inhibition of cell migration and organization of actin stress fibers and induces a srcindependent reversible inhibition of cell proliferation that correlates with  xxxg366xxx  down-regulation.
materials and methods

cell culture—human umbilical vein endothelial cell (huvec), nih
3t3, swiss 3t3, and l6 cells were grown as described previously (13,
15). newborn rat aorta smooth muscle cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture
of dmem (cellgro) and ham’s f-12 (cellgro) supplemented with 5%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (hyclone) (16) and human fibroblasts (imr 90

 xxxd157xxx  binds  xxxg2004xxx  and inhibits the release of
 xxxg786xxx  ( xxxg786xxx ). because members of
the s100 gene family are known to be involved with the
function of the cytoskeleton, we examined the ability of
 xxxd157xxx  to modify the cytoskeleton and report that
 xxxd157xxx  induces a dramatic reduction in the presence
of actin stress fibers and the appearance of a random,
non-oriented distribution of focal adhesion sites. correspondingly,  xxxd157xxx  induces the complete and reversible non-apoptotic inhibition of cell migration and proliferation, and although  xxxd157xxx  does not induce either
the down-regulation of f-actin levels or the depolymerization of actin filaments, it does induce the tyrosine
phosphorylation of cortactin, a src substrate known to
regulate actin bundling. in addition, a dominant negative
form of src is able to partially rescue cells from the effect
of  xxxd157xxx  on both the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. in contrast, the inhibition of cell proliferation by
 xxxd157xxx  correlates with the inhibition of  xxxg366xxx  expression without interference of the receptor  xxxg2198xxx /mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. last, the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to inhibit  xxxg786xxx  release
is reversible and correlates with the restoration of the
actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role for the actin cytoskeleton in the  xxxg786xxx  release pathway.

monolayers were washed with dmem containing 5 units/ml heparin
(the upjohn co.). cells previously treated with  xxxd157xxx  were also
incubated in dmem containing 5 units/ml heparin but in the presence
or absence of 0.375 mm  xxxd157xxx , and the cells, previously not treated
with  xxxd157xxx , were further incubated under  xxxd157xxx -free conditions. the cell populations were subjected to heat shock (42 °c for 110
min) as previously reported (5, 23). to evaluate the effect of latrunculin
on  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1 release, nih 3t3 cells transfected with  xxxg786xxx 
and p65 syt1 were grown until 70% confluent and were subjected to
heat shock (42 °c, 110 min) in the presence and absence of 400 nm
latrunculin (biomol). media conditioned by this response were processed and analyzed by  xxxg786xxx  and/or syt1 immunoblot analysis as
described previously (5, 23).
results

 xxxd157xxx  reversibly modifies cell morphology—we have
previously demonstrated that the  xxxg2004xxx  binding compound,
 xxxd157xxx , inhibits the release of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1 from
nih 3t3 cells in response to heat shock (1). since several
members of the  xxxg2004xxx  family are cytoskeleton-associated
proteins (6, 7), we questioned whether  xxxd157xxx  could modify
cell morphology. after exposure for 24 h to  xxxd157xxx , nih
3t3 cells exhibited a dramatic change in their morphology that
included a larger and more flattened phenotype and often displayed long processes that are stable for at least 10 days (fig.
1, a and b). interestingly, the  xxxd157xxx -induced morphology
of nih 3t3 cells completely reverted to the normal phenotype
2 days after the removal of  xxxd157xxx .
 xxxd157xxx  was also able to produce similar, reversible effects on cell morphology in a large variety of cell lines, including huvec (fig. 1, c and d), swiss 3t3 cells, human imr90
fibroblasts, newborn rat aorta smooth muscle cells, rat l6
myoblasts, and the murine glioma cell lines u251mg and
u563mg (data not shown). interestingly, the phenotype exhibited by huvec populations resembled the phase contrast morphology of the senescent huvec phenotype resulting from
extended serial propagation in vitro (24). in addition, serum
starvation accelerated the effects of  xxxd157xxx  upon cell morphology. nih and swiss 3t3 cells serum-starved for 2 days and
then treated with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  exhibited a more dramatic
and rapid morphological change than cells maintained in complete cell culture medium (data not shown).
 xxxd157xxx  induces changes in the actin cytoskeleton—the
induction and reversion of morphological changes produced by
 xxxd157xxx  prompted us to examine the organization of the
cytoskeleton using huvec populations which are quite sensitive to agents that promote apoptosis. interestingly, we observed no differences in the level of apoptosis between control
(2.5% ⫾ 1.0) and  xxxd157xxx -treated (2.6% ⫾ 1.1) huvec
populations as well as nih and swiss 3t3 cells (data not
shown), using an assessment of chromatin fragmentation by
hoechst staining. in addition, fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin staining of huvec populations treated for 4 days with
 xxxd157xxx  revealed a dramatic attenuation of the f-actin cytoskeleton (fig. 1, e and f). indeed, the  xxxd157xxx -treated
cells exhibited either a complete absence or strong down-regulation of phalloidin-positive f-actin stress fibers. however, the
subplasmalemmal f-actin cortex remained readily apparent in
the  xxxd157xxx -treated cells. this change in the appearance of
the f-actin cytoskeleton became visible as early as 4 to 8 h after
the addition of  xxxd157xxx  and was fully prominent after 24 h
(data not shown). similar changes in the f-actin cytoskeleton
were induced by 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  in swiss (data not shown)
and nih 3t3 cells (fig. 3, a and b). in addition, the changes in
the f-actin cytoskeleton induced by  xxxd157xxx  were reversible.
indeed, 2 hours after the removal of  xxxd157xxx , the majority of
the huvec population previously treated for 4 days with
 xxxd157xxx  exhibited the presence of prominent f-actin stress
fibers in vitro (fig. 1g). in contrast, however, despite the dra-

westermark (university of uppsala, uppsala, sweden), were grown in
dmem supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (bcs; hyclone)
(17). nih 3t3 cells were transfected with a mutated form of xenopus
laevis src in which lysine 294 was replaced by alanine and tyrosine 526
was replaced by phenylalanine (18). the src mutant, kindly provided by
r. friesel was cloned into pcdna 3.1/hygro vector (invitrogen) using
the xhoi and xbai restriction sites. the transfection was performed
using a multi-component lipid-based reagent (fugene 6, roche molecular biochemicals). swiss 3t3 or nih 3t3 cells were made quiescent
by incubating the confluent monolayer in serum-free hormone-defined
medium (dmi) as described (19).  xxxd157xxx  (aa673) was a generous
gift of takeda chemical industries, osaka, japan and was solubilized
in equimolar naoh. latrunculin and jasplakinolide were purchased
from biomol and molecular probes, respectively.
fluorescence microscopy and f-actin expression—immunofluorescence and f-actin staining were performed as described previously (13)
focal adhesion sites, vinculin and tubulin, were stained using, respectively, a monoclonal anti- xxxd1075xxx  (upstate biotechnology), a
monoclonal anti-vinculin (sigma), and a monoclonal anti-tubulin (sigma) antibody. to examine f-actin expression, cells were fixed in 4%
(v/v) formaldehyde in buffer a (5 mm pipes, ph 7.2, containing 5 mm
kcl, 138 mm nacl, 4 mm nahco3, 0.4 mm kh2po4, 2 mm mgcl2, and
2 mm egta) and permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) triton x-100 in buffer
a for 20 min. the monolayers were rinsed in 0.1 m glycine in buffer a for
10 min and washed 5 times with buffer a. the cells were incubated in
1 ␮m nbd-phallacidin (molecular probes) in buffer a for 1 h and
washed 5 times for 5 min with buffer a, and the f-actin-bound nbdphallacidin was extracted with methanol at 4 °c for 90 min. simultaneously, cells plated at the same density and treated as described above
were used to quantitate cell number using a hematocytometer. fluorescence of the methanol extraction solution was measured at 465-nm
excitation and 535-nm emission and normalized against cell number
(21).
immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis—cells were grown
to confluence and incubated for 48 h in dmi, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and collected by centrifugation
(1.000 ⫻ g, 10 min). cell pellets were lysed for 20 min in 0.5 ml of cold
lysis buffer (20 mm tris, ph 7.5, containing 300 mm sucrose, 60 mm kcl,
15 mm nacl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm edta, 1% (v/v) triton x-100, 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 2 ␮g/ml leupeptin,
and 0.2% (w/v)  xxxd1835xxx ) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate,
and cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (2.000 ⫻ g, 10 min). for
actin immunoblot analysis, cells were treated as described above except
the cells were not pretreated with dmi and were lysed in cold lysis
buffer not containing sodium orthovanadate. actin levels were evaluated using an anti-actin monoclonal antibody from sigma. for  xxxg366xxx 
analysis, quiescent swiss 3t3 cells were treated for 6 h with either 1
mm  xxxd157xxx  or with 10 ng/ml  xxxg786xxx  or with both and lysed as
described above. protein concentration was determined using the pierce
bca protein assay kit. to examine protein tyrosine phosphorylation,
immunoprecipitation was performed using a rabbit antibody against
cortactin (12), a rabbit antibody against focal adhesion kinase (sigma),
two rabbit antibodies against  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  (santa cruz), a rabbit
antibody against pdgfr type b (upstate biotechnology), a rabbit antibody against  xxxg791xxx  (13), and a rabbit antibody against the insulin
receptor ␤ subunit (upstate biotechnology) as described previously (12).
analysis of cell migration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis—cell
proliferation was assessed as described previously (15), and cell migration was evaluated using an in vitro model of wound repair as described
(22). to examine apoptosis, confluent monolayers of huvec and nih
3t3 cells were incubated with or without 0.375 m or 1 mm  xxxd157xxx . to
prevent the loss of floating apoptotic cells from the cell population, fresh
medium was added every 2 days to the culture dish without removing
the old medium. after 3 days, the cells were harvested by trypsin
digestion, and the floating cells were independently collected by centrifugation and combined with the cells obtained from the monolayer.
the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and smears
were prepared and fixed in 70% (v/v) ethanol. the cells were stained
with 100 ng/ml hoechst #33258 (sigma) for 1 min, and apoptotic nuclei
with fragmented chromatin were quantitated using a fluorescence microscope. five hundred cells were counted per treatment, and apoptotic
cells were expressed as a percentage of total cells counted. the experiment was repeated in triplicate using two wells for each condition.
analysis of  xxxg786xxx  release—the reversibility of  xxxg786xxx  release after
 xxxd157xxx  pretreatment was performed using nih 3t3 cells stably
transfected with  xxxg786xxx  (23). cells were grown until 70% confluence and
incubated overnight in the presence or absence of 1 mm  xxxd157xxx . the

matic attenuation of the f-actin cytoskeleton, the amlexanoxtreated huvec population did not exhibit any significant
change in the organization of their tubulin-containing microtubule and vimentin-containing intermediate filament networks (data not shown). fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin
staining of  xxxd157xxx -treated, serum-deprived nih and swiss
3t3 cells exhibited a very rapid (30 min to 1 h) disappearance
of actin stress fibers and the fragmentation of the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown).
the strong attenuation of f-actin stress fibers after treatment with  xxxd157xxx  prompted us to evaluate the total level of
actin and the level of f-actin in huvec populations before and
after exposure to  xxxd157xxx  for 48 h. as shown in fig. 1h,
actin immunoblot analysis revealed no difference in the levels
of actin expression between  xxxd157xxx -treated and control
huvec populations. similarly, we did not observe a difference
in the content of polymerized actin as measured by the fluorescence of methanol-extracted nbd phallacidin between the con-

nih 3t3 cells (a and b) and huvec (c

under “materials and methods” in the absence (a and c) or in the presence of 1 mm

contrast microscopy (a–c, 10⫻; d, 20⫻)
was used to record the phenotype. fluorescence microscopy of actin distribution
(e–g) is shown in huvec populations
incubated in the presence (f) or in the
absence (e) of 0.375 mm  xxxd157xxx  for 4
days. actin distribution in huvec populations treated with 0.375 mm  xxxd157xxx 
for 4 days and further incubated for 2 h in
normal growth medium without  xxxd157xxx  (g) is shown. fluorescent photomicrographs were taken with a 100⫻ objective. h, immunoblot analysis of total actin

presence of 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  did not alter the steady state
levels of the actin transcript in swiss 3t3 cells as assessed by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (data not
shown). in addition, jasplakinolide, an agent that binds and
stabilizes filamentous actin (20), prevented the amlexanoxinduced changes in cell morphology and attenuation of f-actin
stress fibers (data not shown).
 xxxd157xxx  induces cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation—
because (i)  xxxd157xxx  was able to affect the organization of
actin stress fibers without affecting the expression of actin and
its polymerization and (ii) serum deprivation potentiated the
effect of  xxxd157xxx , we evaluated the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, an actin-binding protein whose phosphorylation by src has been implicated in the rearrangement of
the actin cytoskeleton after growth factor stimulation (25).
since swiss 3t3 cells under conditions of serum deprivation

display a very low level of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation,
we examined this cell culture system for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in response to  xxxd157xxx . as shown in fig.
2, we observed that the  xxxd157xxx  was able to stimulate the
tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in a rapid and sustained
manner. interestingly, the intensity of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by  xxxd157xxx  (fig. 2) appeared to be
greater than that achieved by  xxxg786xxx  after a 6-h incubation
period.  xxxd1075xxx  analysis of cortactin immunoprecipitates also revealed the presence of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including a p60 protein that was phosphorylated
in parallel with cortactin in  xxxd157xxx -treated cells as well as
in cells stimulated with  xxxg786xxx  for 6 h (fig. 2). two additional
proteins, p110 and p140, were also phosphorylated on tyrosine
residues in an  xxxd157xxx -dependent manner 30 min and 2 h
after  xxxd157xxx  treatment but not in the presence of  xxxg786xxx 
(fig. 2).
a dominant negative form of src prevents the amlexanoxinduced collapse of actin cytoskeleton and down-regulates
cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in  xxxd157xxx -treated
cells—since (i) cortactin is a protein phosphorylated by src in
response to extracellular growth factors stimulation (12), (ii)
 xxxd1075xxx  analysis of cortactin immunoprecipitates after
 xxxd157xxx  treatment revealed the presence of a p60 protein
(fig. 2), and (iii) cortactin is involved in the regulation of actin
bundling (25), we investigated the involvement of the src phosphorylation in the  xxxd157xxx -dependent collapse of the actin
cytoskeleton using a dominant negative (dn) mutant of src (18).
stable dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants were obtained, and
these displayed enhanced levels of the src transcript and protein, as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction and immunoblot analysis, respectively (data not
shown). interestingly, treatment with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  for 48 h
in the presence of 10% (w/v) bcs resulted in the disappearance
of actin stress fibers in nih 3t3 cells (fig. 3, a and b) but
failed to completely destroy stress fibers in dnsrc nih 3t3 cell

cells treated with  xxxd157xxx . swiss 3t3 cells were grown to confluence and incubated for 48 h in dmi. quiescent cells were further
incubated with either 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  for the times indicated or with
10 ng/ml  xxxg786xxx  for 6 h. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with
rabbit anti-cortactin antibody 2719 (12), resolved by 8% (w/v) acrylamide sds-page, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (upstate biotechnology) as described under
“materials and methods.” the arrows indicate the position of cortactin
and three other  xxxd1075xxx -containing proteins with approximate
masses of 60, 110, and 140 kda.

transfectants (fig. 3, c and d). correspondingly,  xxxd157xxx 
also induced a less dramatic morphological change in dnsrc
nih 3t3 cell transfectants (data not shown).
although nih 3t3 cells displayed high levels of cortactin
tyrosine phosphorylation under conditions of cellular quiescence and these levels were not significantly altered by the
addition of either  xxxd157xxx  or  xxxg786xxx , cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the dnsrc nih 3t3
cell transfectants treated for 6 h with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  (fig.
4a). this decrease in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation also
correlated with the conservation of the actin cytoskeleton observed in the  xxxd157xxx -treated dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants (fig. 3).
 xxxd157xxx  reversibly inhibits cell migration—since (i)  xxxd157xxx  modifies the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton
through a src-related mechanism and (ii) src is involved in the
regulation of cell migration (13), we examined the ability of
 xxxd157xxx  to interfere with cell motility (22). indeed, the migratory ability of nih 3t3 cells was significantly diminished by
the presence of  xxxd157xxx  in a dose-dependent manner, with a
half-maximum value of approximately 100 ␮m  xxxd157xxx  (fig.
5a). the vehicle (1 mm naoh) used to deliver  xxxd157xxx  did
not modify the migratory ability of nih 3t3 cell population
(fig. 5a). similar results were obtained using swiss 3t3 cells
and huvec (data not shown). this repression of cell migration
was reversible (data not shown) and occurred at concentrations
of  xxxd157xxx  similar to those that were able to alter both cell
morphology and actin cytoskeleton.
since dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants exhibited an attenuation of the effect of  xxxd157xxx  on the actin cytoskeleton, we
evaluated the capacity of  xxxd157xxx  to suppress the motility of
these cells. as shown in fig. 5b,  xxxd157xxx  exhibited a strong
inhibition of nih 3t3 cell migration, whereas the inhibition of
cell motility was less dramatic in two clones of the dnsrc nih
3t3 cell transfectants treated with  xxxd157xxx .
 xxxd157xxx  induces changes in focal adhesion site distribution and modifies the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase—since actin stress fibers are known to be structurally linked to focal adhesion sites through ␣-actinin (26) and
are involved in the regulation of cell migration and adhesion
(27), we questioned whether  xxxd157xxx  treatment was able to
modify the organization of focal adhesion sites in nih 3t3 cells
and dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants. immunohistochemical
staining for vinculin, a component of focal adhesion sites (28),
demonstrated that  xxxd157xxx  treatment in the presence of
serum resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity and
the redistribution of focal adhesion sites in nih 3t3 cells.
instead of the parallel and well oriented focal adhesion sites
that are often concentrated at the leading edge of the cell and
usually observed in cells undergoing migration (24), we observed a radial or random distribution of the vinculin-positive
focal adhesion sites in the  xxxd157xxx -treated cells (fig. 3, e
and f). this phenotype is usually associated with non-migratory and “sedentary” populations of cells (24). the effect of
 xxxd157xxx  on focal adhesion site orientation in the dnsrc nih
3t3 transfectants was not as dramatic as that observed with
control nih 3t3 cells (fig. 3, g and h), and this is consistent
with the resistance of dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants to
 xxxd157xxx -induced inhibition of cell migration. in addition,
under short term conditions of serum deprivation,  xxxd157xxx 
produced a more dramatic and faster disappearance of focal
adhesion sites in nih 3t3 cells, whereas  xxxd157xxx  treatment
produced only a partial redistribution of focal adhesion sites in
the dnsrc nih 3t3 transfectants (data not shown).
since src has been demonstrated to regulate cell migration
by forming a complex with focal adhesion kinase (fak) in focal

adhesion sites (29), we examined whether the  xxxd157xxx -induced redistribution of focal adhesion sites in nih 3t3 cells
correlated with a change in the tyrosine phosphorylation of
fak.  xxxd1075xxx  analysis of fak immunoprecipitates
exhibited similar levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in control
nih 3t3 and dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants (fig. 4b). after
treatment with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  for 6 h under serum-free
conditions, cells displayed a moderate down-regulation of fak
phosphorylation in both control nih 3t3 and dnsrc nih 3t3
cell transfectants (fig. 4b). this was also observed in swiss
3t3 cells (data not shown).
 xxxd157xxx  reversibly inhibits cell proliferation—since (i)
 xxxd157xxx  inhibits the release of  xxxg786xxx  from nih 3t3 cells in
response to heat shock (1), (ii) the ability of  xxxg786xxx  to induce
biologic responses requires its presence in the extracellular
compartment to mediate receptor-dependent signaling (2, 3),
and (iii) other reagents that affect the integrity of actin cytoskeleton also inhibit cell proliferation (30), we examined the
ability of  xxxd157xxx  to modify in vitro the growth of huvec,

cells that are dependent upon the presence of a source of
extracellular fgf for growth (15).  xxxd157xxx  was able to inhibit the growth of huvec (fig. 6a) in a dose-dependent
manner, with a half-maximum value of approximately 30 ␮m
 xxxd157xxx  (data not shown). the vehicle (0.375 mm naoh)
used to deliver  xxxd157xxx  did not modify the proliferative
ability of the huvec population (fig. 6a). the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to repress huvec growth was time-dependent, with
significant inhibition of huvec growth observed after 72 h of
treatment with the drug (data not shown). we also examined
the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to inhibit dna synthesis. huvec
populations were treated for 2 or 4 days with  xxxd157xxx  in a
concentration-dependent manner, and their ability to incorporate [3h]thymidine in the nucleus was assessed by autoradiography. we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of dna synthesis in cells treated with  xxxd157xxx  with a half-maximal
effect at 30 ␮m  xxxd157xxx  (data not shown). similar results
were observed with human imr90 fibroblasts, newborn rat

swiss 3t3 cells, and the murine glioma cell lines u251mg and
u563mg. although the swiss 3t3 and nih 3t3 cells were less
responsive to  xxxd157xxx  with half-maximal inhibition of cell
growth at 300 ␮m, the remainder of the cells exhibited growth
inhibition at concentrations of  xxxd157xxx  similar to that observed with huvec populations (data not shown).
we also examined whether the inhibition of cell growth was
reversible. confluent populations of huvec were exposed to
0.375 mm  xxxd157xxx , and after 4 days, the cells were harvested
by trypsin digestion and replated, and the  xxxd157xxx -pretreated cells were incubated with or without 0.375 mm  xxxd157xxx . as shown in fig. 6a, the huvec population previously
exposed to  xxxd157xxx  initially exhibited a decrease in their
proliferative ability but after 3 days exhibited a population
doubling time similar to the control,  xxxd157xxx -free population. in contrast, the huvec population previously exposed to
 xxxd157xxx  was not able to proliferate if  xxxd157xxx  remained
present in the cell culture medium (fig. 6a). flow cytometry
analysis of huvec treated with  xxxd157xxx  and swiss 3t3
cells synchronized by incubation in the presence of either dmi
and/or 4 mm thymidine and stimulated with serum in the
presence and absence of  xxxd157xxx  demonstrated that  xxxd157xxx  inhibits the cell cycle in g1 and g2 phases (data not
shown).

 xxxg366xxx , a protein that plays a key role in the progression
from g0 through g1 into the s phase and is up-regulated in g1
phase of cell cycle (24). as shown in fig. 6c, quiescent swiss
3t3 cells did not express detectable levels of  xxxg366xxx , and
 xxxd157xxx  was not able to induce  xxxg366xxx  expression. however, cells stimulated for 6 h with  xxxg786xxx  demonstrated an
induction of  xxxg366xxx  protein expression, and this induction
was inhibited by the simultaneous exposure of cells to 1 mm
 xxxd157xxx  (fig. 6c). we also evaluated  xxxg366xxx  protein levels
during swiss 3t3 cell proliferation in response to serum in the
presence and absence of 1 mm  xxxd157xxx . as shown in fig. 6c,
proliferating populations of swiss 3t3 cells exhibited high levels of  xxxg366xxx , but after exposure to  xxxd157xxx , the levels of
 xxxg366xxx  were significantly and rapidly decreased.
to understand if the  xxxd157xxx -dependent inhibition of  xxxg366xxx  induction was the result of its ability to interfere with
polypeptide growth factor/receptor/ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, we evaluated the capacity of
 xxxg786xxx ,  xxxd292xxx , and insulin to activate their receptors in the
presence of  xxxd157xxx . quiescent swiss 3t3 cells were treated
for 6 h with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  or incubated for an additional 6 h
in serum-free medium without  xxxd157xxx  and then were stimulated for 30 min with either 10 ng/ml  xxxg786xxx , 5 ng/ml pdgfbb, or 1 ␮g/ml insulin in the presence or absence of  xxxd157xxx .
 xxxd1075xxx  immunoblot analysis following  xxxg791xxx ,
pdgfr type b, and  xxxg1194xxx  ␤ subunit immunoprecipitation demonstrated that exposure to  xxxd157xxx  was not able
to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors and
was unable to prevent their tyrosine phosphorylation in response to their respective ligands (fig. 7). in addition,  xxxg1369xxx 
and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation in response to either  xxxg786xxx  (fig.
6b) or  xxxd292xxx  (data not shown) was not affected by exposure
of quiescent swiss 3t3 cells to  xxxd157xxx . these data suggest
that the ability of polypeptide growth factors to induce the
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathway is independent of the presence of the
f-actin cytoskeleton.
 xxxd157xxx  inhibition of  xxxg786xxx  secretion is reversible—since
the effects of  xxxd157xxx  on the actin cytoskeleton, cell morphology, and cell migration are reversible, we examined
whether the inhibition of  xxxg786xxx  release by  xxxd157xxx  was also
reversible.  xxxg786xxx  nih 3t3 cell transfectants were treated for
18 h with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  in the presence of 10% (v/v) bcs to
produce a collapse of actin cytoskeleton.  xxxd157xxx  was removed from the medium, and the cells were subjected to heat
shock (42 °c, 110 min) in the presence or absence of 0.375 mm
 xxxd157xxx . as shown in fig. 8a,  xxxd157xxx  treatment resulted
in a significant inhibition of  xxxg786xxx  release, but  xxxg786xxx  release
was completely restored if  xxxd157xxx  was removed from the
cell culture medium before the temperature stress.
to further investigate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in
 xxxg786xxx  release, we evaluated the effect of latrunculin, a drug
known to depolymerize f-actin (30), on  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1
release. nih 3t3 cells stably transfected with either  xxxg786xxx  (23)
or with  xxxg786xxx  and p65 syt1 (4, 5) were subjected to temperature stress in the presence and absence of 400 nm latrunculin.
as shown in fig. 8, b and c, a significant inhibition of both
 xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1 release in response to heat shock was
observed in the latrunculin-treated cells.

observation that the inhibition of cell migration and proliferation by  xxxd157xxx  was reversible.
in association with the suppression of cell migration and
proliferation, prominent changes in cell morphology were also
observed. indeed, in most situations these morphologic changes
were rapid and were readily visible after approximately 8 to
12 h. these morphologic alterations included an increase in cell
size, the formation of a more flattened appearance, and the
generation of long dendrite-like processes. interestingly, the
changes correlated with a strong attenuation of the presence of
actin stress fibers in cells treated with  xxxd157xxx  at concentrations that not only inhibit cell migration and proliferation
but also alter and disorient the distribution of focal adhesion
sites. in addition, we also observed more rapid and prominent
morphological changes induced by  xxxd157xxx  with a disappearance of actin stress fibers and subplasmalemmal cortex
under serum-free conditions.
it is clear that the effects of  xxxd157xxx  on the cytoskeleton
are not due to the down-regulation of intracellular levels of
actin or to the depolymerization of actin filaments. also, using
an in vitro system of actin polymerization, we observed that
 xxxd157xxx  was unable to inhibit this process.2 we therefore
suggest that the process of actin microfilament bundling may
be involved in mediating the effects of  xxxd157xxx . supportive
of this interpretation is the observation that jasplakinolide, an
agent known to stabilize actin stress fibers (20), is able to
prevent the effects of  xxxd157xxx  on cell morphology and actin
cytoskeleton.
the mechanism utilized by  xxxd157xxx  appears to involve the
function of cortactin and src. cortactin is a src substrate and
an f-actin-binding protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation results in a dramatic reduction in f-actin cross-linking activity
and actin bundling (25). indeed,  xxxd157xxx  is able to rapidly
induce and sustain the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin,
and in response to  xxxd157xxx , cortactin is able to associate
with a variety of  xxxd1075xxx -containing proteins includ2

ing a p60 polypeptide. since it has been demonstrated that
cortactin is phosphorylated by src in response to  xxxg786xxx  and
other growth factors as a relatively late event in the g1 phase
of cell cycle (12, 31), we evaluated the role of src pathway in
mediating the effect of  xxxd157xxx . the overexpression of a
dominant negative form of src, known to act as an inhibitor of
endogenous src activity (18), attenuated the effect of  xxxd157xxx  on both cell morphology and actin stress fibers. in addition,  xxxd157xxx  was also able to significantly reduce the levels
of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in the dnsrc nih 3t3 cell
transfectants. the dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants were also
less sensitive to  xxxd157xxx -induced inhibition of cell motility
and to the redistribution of focal adhesion sites, suggesting
that these effects of  xxxd157xxx  may also be mediated, in part,
by src.
since it is well established that fak is localized at focal
adhesion sites (29) and is involved in the regulation of cell
migration in response to extracellular stimuli (27), we evaluated whether  xxxd157xxx  was able to affect fak phosphorylation. interestingly,  xxxd157xxx  was only able to produce a moderate down-regulation of fak phosphorylation in both nih
3t3 and the dnsrc nih 3t3 cell transfectants, and this effect
required a prolonged exposure (3– 6 h) to  xxxd157xxx . these
results suggest that the redistribution of focal adhesion sites in
 xxxd157xxx -treated cells may be a consequence of the collapse of
the actin cytoskeleton. this interpretation is consistent with
the observation that a 1-h treatment with  xxxd157xxx  under
conditions of serum deprivation was able to affect the intensity
and the distribution of vinculin-positive focal adhesion sites in
nih 3t3 cells but not dramatically alter the tyrosine phosphorylation of fak (data not shown).
because the treatment of cells with  xxxd157xxx  was able to
prevent the  xxxg786xxx -induced up-regulation of  xxxg366xxx  in both
quiescent and proliferating populations of swiss 3t3 cells, we
evaluated the capacity of  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxd292xxx , and insulin to
activate their cell surface receptors in presence of  xxxd157xxx .
interestingly, the exposure of cells to  xxxd157xxx  for 6 h did not
prevent the ability of  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxd292xxx , and insulin to induce
the auto-phosphorylation of their receptors. in addition, aml-

 xxxd157xxx  induces the disassembly of stress fibers

exanox treatment did not alter the ability of  xxxg786xxx  and
 xxxd292xxx  to induce  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation in
quiescent swiss 3t3 cells and did not prevent the  xxxg786xxx -induced migration of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  to the nucleus (data not
shown). we also evaluated the capacity of  xxxd157xxx  to interfere with  xxxg791xxx  activation as a function of exposure time to
 xxxd157xxx  using quiescent populations of swiss 3t3 cells, and
we observed a decrease in the ability of  xxxg786xxx  to induce the
autophosphorylation of  xxxg791xxx  only after long term exposure
(18 h) of the cells to  xxxd157xxx . shorter time periods of exposure to  xxxd157xxx , which were able to induce the disaggregation of actin cytoskeleton and prevent the up-regulation of
 xxxg366xxx , failed to interfere with receptor signaling. since
 xxxd157xxx  was able to inhibit the proliferation of dnsrc nih
3t3 cells and the induction of  xxxg366xxx  in dnsrc nih 3t3 cells
(data not shown), we suggest that the anti-proliferative effect of
 xxxd157xxx  is dissociated from its effect on the src pathway.
this could be explained by the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to interfere
with  xxxg366xxx  induction and the molecular events that are
responsible for the g1 transition, yet these appear to be independent of the induction of the polypeptide growth factor/re-

ceptor/ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. our data may also suggest the importance of the actin
cytoskeleton during pre-replicative events of the g1 phase.
other biochemical agents such as the cytochalasines and
latrunculins also induce the disorganization of actin cytoskeleton as well as the inhibition of cell proliferation (30). however,
unlike  xxxd157xxx , these agents induce apoptosis, and their
effects on the actin cytoskeleton are more rapid and include the
attenuation of stress fibers, a prominent decrease in f-actin
protein levels, and a reduction in the subplasmalemmal f-actin
cortex. in addition, the latrunculins and cytochalasines induce
prominent cell rounding and the formation of cytoplasmic
blebs, and these effects were not observed with  xxxd157xxx  in
the presence of serum (30). indeed, to our knowledge, this is the
first study to identify a reagent that is able to induce the
reversible disassembly of actin bundles without influencing
actin polymerization and inducing apoptosis. the biological
activities of  xxxd157xxx  may also offer novel opportunities for
its use as a reagent for studies in the fields of cell biology and
experimental medicine. the reversible suppression of cell
growth may potentially be used to synchronize cells, and its

 xxxd157xxx  induces the disassembly of stress fibers

effect on actin stress fibers may prove useful for studies of the
organization and functions of the actin cytoskeleton. in addition,  xxxd157xxx  may also prove useful as a reagent to assess
the role of actin stress fibers in the cellular trafficking of
organelles and macromolecules. lastly, the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to reversibly inhibit human endothelial cell migration and
proliferation suggest that its anti-inflammatory activities in
vivo may possess an anti-angiogenic component. however, the
poor solubility of  xxxd157xxx  will require the development of
novel methods for the efficient in vivo delivery of this rather
interesting biological antagonist.
the reason for studying the mechanism of  xxxd157xxx  activity was the observation that  xxxd157xxx  is able to bind  xxxg2004xxx 
(14), a protein that together with syt1 is a component of a
heparin binding multiprotein complex involved in the mechanism of  xxxg786xxx  release (1). little is known about the biological
functions and intracellular localization of  xxxg2004xxx , and it is a
relatively novel member of the s100 gene family of calciumbinding proteins (32). however, it is well described that s100
gene family members, s100a1 and s100a4 (6, 7) co-localize
with actin stress fibers. in addition,  xxxg2007xxx  is able to associate
with the actin-capping protein, capz (33), and s100a2 is interactive with tropomyosins (34), which are known to regulate
the bundling of actin filaments (35). thus, the ability of  xxxd157xxx  to induce cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and to
modify actin stress fibers in vitro may reflect either the potential co-localization of  xxxg2004xxx  with the actin filaments or a
potential role of  xxxg2004xxx  to cooperate in the organization of
actin cytoskeleton.
the effect of  xxxd157xxx  on the src pathway and actin stress
fiber disassembly could underlie the mechanism used by this
agent to interfere with the function of proteins involved in the
release of  xxxg786xxx  as well as its ability to suppress the release of
histamine by mast cells, an important allergenic mediator (36).
we observed that the effect of  xxxd157xxx  on  xxxg786xxx  release is

fig. 8. the reversible effect of  xxxd157xxx  on  xxxg786xxx  release and
the ability of latrunculin to inhibit  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1 release.
a, nih 3t3 cells transfected with  xxxg786xxx  were grown until 70% confluence and treated for 18 h with 1 mm  xxxd157xxx  to obtain a complete
collapse of actin cytoskeleton.  xxxd157xxx  was removed, and the cells
were incubated for 110 min at 42 °c in dmem containing 5 units/ml
heparin with and without 0.375 mm  xxxd157xxx . conditioned media
were prepared as described under “materials and methods,” resolved by
15% (w/v) acrylamide sds-page, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a rabbit anti- xxxg786xxx  antibody. b and c, nih 3t3 cells transfected with  xxxg786xxx  (b) or cotransfected with  xxxg786xxx  and p65 syt1 (c) were
grown until 70% confluent and incubated for 110 min at 42 °c in
dmem containing 5 units/ml heparin in the presence or absence of 400
nm latrunculin. conditioned media were prepared as described under
“materials and methods,” resolved by 12% (w/v) acrylamide sdspage, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a rabbit anti- xxxg786xxx 
(b) and a rabbit anti-syt1 (c) antibodies.

reversible and correlates with the restoration of the actin cytoskeleton. moreover, latrunculin, another reagent that affects
the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton through a different mechanism that involves the depolymerization of f-actin (30), is also
able to inhibit the release of  xxxg786xxx  and p40 syt1 in response to
temperature stress. thus it is possible that the function of the
src pathway and the actin cytoskeleton may be involved in the
regulation of the intracellular trafficking responsible for  xxxg786xxx 
and syt1 release. since (i) p65 syt1, a transmembrane component of intracellular vesicles (37), is involved in the regulation
of exocytotic and endocytotic organelle trafficking (38), including the docking of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane
(39), and (ii) the function of intracellular p65 syt1 is required
for  xxxg786xxx  release (4), we suggest that syt1-positive intracellular vesicles containing the extravesicular  xxxg786xxx  homodimer
may traffic along actin stress fibers and that the function of
 xxxg2004xxx  or other members of the s100 gene family may be
involved in the regulation of this trafficking.
