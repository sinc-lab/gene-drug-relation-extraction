abstract.  xxxd2098xxx , a /f-adrenergic agonist recently introduced to treat asthmatic disorders, inhibits antigen-induced histamine release from human basophil leukocytes and lung mast cells in a dose-dependent fash­
ion. the dose-response inhibition curve is paralleled by a  xxxd2098xxx -induced increase in the camp levels of hu­
man leukocyte preparations. the relationship between the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  and camp level is supported by
the finding that the ^-adrenergic agonist only inhibits the first stage of antigen-induced histamine release and
not the release caused by the ca2+ ionophore, a23187. propranolol, a competitive antagonist of /^-adrenergic
receptor, blocks the inhibition of release and the camp accumulation caused by  xxxd2098xxx . finally,  xxxd3344xxx ­
line, a cam p phosphodiesterase inhibitor, synergistically potentiates the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on hista­
mine release and the accumulation of camp. these data suggest that  xxxd2098xxx  may modulate the in vivo re­
lease of the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions via the activation of /^ - a d r e n e r g ic receptor
linked to adenylate cyclase on human basophils and mast cells.

chemical mediators released from basophils and
mast cells probably play a role in the pathogenesis of
human allergic and inflammatory disorders. there­
fore, considerable effort has been devoted to the study
of the pharmacological control of the basophil/mast
cell release reactions.
increasing evidence suggests that cyclic adenosine
3'-5'-monophosphate (camp) participates in both
the initiation and the modulation of ige-mediated re­
lease reactions [6, 7, 9] of these cells. exogenous
camp and camp phosphodiesterase inhibitors sup­
press ige-mediated histamine release from human
basophils and mast cells [1,7, 11, 19], furthermore,
catecholamines, adenosine and prostaglandins of the
e series, and histamine itself, inhibit the ige-mediat­
ed release reaction from human basophils [1, 15].
their inhibitory effects are mediated by activation of
cell surface receptors linked to adenylate cyclase,
thereby resulting in increased intracellular camp [1,
14, 15]. analogs of these substances are utilized clin­

ically in the treatment of obstructive airway diseases
[24, 28, 29],
 xxxd2098xxx , a selective agonist of /f-adrenergic re­
ceptors [21] exerts a marked bronchodilator effect in
vivo [28] and prevents antigen-induced passive perito­
neal anaphylaxis in the rat [4], based on these in vivo
observations, we evaluated the in vitro effects of feno­
terol on ige-mediated histamine release from baso­
phil leukocytes of allergic donors and from human
lung mast cells. it was found that  xxxd2098xxx  inhibits
ige-mediated histamine release. our results suggest
that this effect is probably due to an increase in the in­
tracellular  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) content of human ba­
sophils and mast cells, in turn induced by the interac­
tion between  xxxd2098xxx  and the /f-adrenergic recep­
tors on these cells.

 xxxd2098xxx -induced inhibition of histamine release

buffers
the buffer used in these experiments was made up of 25 mm
pipes, 110 mm naci, 5 mm kc'i (ph 7.35). this mixture is re­
ferred to as p; pc contains, in addition to p, 2.0 mmcacl [20],
histamine release from human basophils
blood was drawn after informed consent was obtained. leuko­
cytes were isolated by dextran sedimentation as previously de­
scribed (16). cells were allowed to sediment for 90 min at 22°c. the
leukocyte-rich upper layer was drawn off, pelleted and washed as
previously described [15]. all cell preparations were 95% viable as
assessed from the ability to exclude erythrosin b. 0.4-ml aliquots of
the cell suspension were placed in falcon 12 x 75 mm polyethylene
tubes and warmed to 37 °c; 0.2 ml of the prewarmed (37 °c) releas­
ing stimuli were added, and incubation was continued at 37°c for
45 min. after centrifugation the cell-free supernatants were assayed
for histamine with an automated fluorometric technique developed
by siraganian (27). the net percentage release was calculated by
subtracting the histamine released spontaneously from the unstim­
ulated aliquots, from the total histamine released from cell aliquots
lysed with 2% perchloric acid. spontaneous release of histamine in
pc was always less than 5% of the total histamine. to study the two
stages (‘first’ and ‘second’) of histamine release [10], cells were incu­
bated with antigen for 2 min in the absence of calcium, washed
twice with cold p. and resuspended in pc as previously described
[15]. all experiments were carried out with the cells of at least 4 sep­
arate donors and each experiment was performed in duplicate or
triplicate, with a less than 5% variation among replicates.
histamine release from human chopped lung
human lung tissue obtained during surgery for resection was
processed as previously described [7], macroscopically normal hu­
man lung tissue, obtained within i h of resection, was dissected free
of major bronchi and blood vessels, chopped with scissors into re­
plicates of 100-200 mg in wet weight and washed 5 times in buffer
p. replicate samples were passively sensitized in 1.0 ml of 1:20 dilu­
tion of serum from a patient highly allergic to ragweed e for 18 h at
22°c, washed and placed in 5.0 ml pc. to assess histamine release,
duplicate samples of human lung tissue were prewarmed to 37°c
and challenged by incubation with antigen e (2x 10"' ,ug/ml) for
20 min. spontaneous histamine release was estimated in duplicate
tubes without antigen. total histamine was measured in parallel tri­
plicate tubes boiled in pc buffer for 10 min to extract tissue hista­
mine [7],

results
the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on ige-mediated histamine
releasefrom human basophils
histamine release from human leukocytes of ryegrass-sensitive donors was measured by adding an
optimal concentration of antigen group-i rye grass to
a series of tubes containing different concentrations
of  xxxd2098xxx . figure 1 shows that  xxxd2098xxx  caused a
dose-dependent inhibition of antigen-induced hista­
mine release from human basophils of allergic do­
nors.  xxxd2098xxx  inhibits during the ‘first stage’ of his­
tamine release and has no effect during the ‘second
stage’ of the release process (fig. 1). the inhibition
caused by  xxxd2098xxx  ranged from about 10%  xxxd1891xxx ~x m
to 50-70%  xxxd1891xxx "4 m. within this concentration range,
 xxxd2098xxx  had no effect on cell viability nor did it
cause spontaneous histamine release.
agents that act on the membrane-bound adenylate
cyclase to increase intracellular camp levels inhibit
histamine secretion during the ‘first stage’ and have
no effect on the ‘second stage’ of the release process
[11, 15]. the data shown in figure 1, therefore, sug­
gested that  xxxd2098xxx  might increase the level of in­
tracellular camp in human basophil leukocytes. fig­
ure 2 shows that the same concentrations of  xxxd2098xxx 
that inhibited histamine release caused a dose-de-

cells were preincubated for 5 min with propranolol or buffer alone

ophylline (2 x l0 -4 m), with or without  xxxd2098xxx 
(10-7 m), and the antigen was added to the mixture.
figure 4 shows that theophylline alone produced a
modest inhibition
15%) of histamine and that a
suboptimal concentration of  xxxd2098xxx  caused a 20%
inhibition. however, a combination of theophylline
and  xxxd2098xxx  produced a marked synergistic effect
both in terms of inhibition of histamine release and
accumulation of camp in leukocytes (fig. 4).

inhibition of the effects o f  xxxd2098xxx  by propranolol
we next investigated the mechanism of  xxxd2098xxx 
inhibition of ige-mediated histamine release. feno­
terol is a /li-adrenergic receptor agonist [21]. there­
fore, the effects exerted by  xxxd2098xxx  on both camp
metabolism and histamine release could be attributed
to a direct action of  xxxd2098xxx  on /^-adrenergic recep­
tor. to explore this possibility we used propranolol, a
competitive antagonist of the /preceptor. the cells
were preincubated for 5 min with or without various
concentrations of propranolol, before the addition of
 xxxd2098xxx . these concentrations of propranolol had
no effect on histamine release by themselves, but they
completely blocked both the  xxxd2098xxx -induced inhi­
bition of histamine release (fig. 3) and camp accumu­
lation in leukocytes (data not shown).
it is known that the phosphodiesterase inhibitor,
theophylline, in combination with /2-agonists, such as
 xxxd2401xxx , synergistically inhibits ige-mediated
histamine release in the human basophil system [9],
experiments were performed to test the effect of the­

the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on ca2+ lonophore
a23187-induced histamine release from human
basophils
the mechanism of histamine release from human
basophils induced by the calcium ionophore a23187
is similar to the terminal biochemical stages of anti­
gen-induced histamine release [12]. agents that act on
the membrane-bound adenylate cyclase to increase
camp levels within the cells have no effect on ionophore-induced histamine release. table i shows that
 xxxd2098xxx  (10~8 to 10-4 m) had no effect on ionophoreinduced histamine release when basophils were
preincubated for 5 or 10 min with the drug before
stimulation.

lenged with an appropriate concentration of antigen

discussion
the present results demonstrate that  xxxd2098xxx , a
selective fc agonist, is a potent inhibitor of ige-mediated histamine release from human basophils and
mast cells. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2098xxx  in vitro
first becomes detectable at a level as low as 10-x to
10~7 m, which is presumably reached during in vivo
treatment with this drug.
previous experiments demonstrated that the me­
chanism of histamine release from human basophils
can be divided into at least two distinct stages [10, 15].
inhibitory agents such as adenosine,  xxxd2401xxx ,
histamine and pget act only during the ‘first stage’,
and inhibition of histamine release is associated with
increases in intracellular camp [1, 15]. the present
data indicate that  xxxd2098xxx  is an effective inhibitor of
basophil histamine release during the ‘first stage’ and
that it increases leukocyte camp levels. inhibition of
histamine release is first observed at about 10-8 m and
it peaks at about 10~5 m; the  xxxd2098xxx -induced
changes in the leukocyte camp level occur over the
same range of concentrations. it should be pointed
out that our results were obtained with mixed leuko­
cytes samples. although a partial purification of ba­
sophil leukocytes has been achieved [13, 22], only
highly purified basophil preparations will allow di­
rect measurement of the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on camp
metabolism. the involvement of camp in fenoterolinduced inhibition is also suggested by the finding
that all the agents known to inhibit histamine release
by increasing intracellular camp, including fenote­
rol, have little or no effect on ionophore-induced his­
tamine release [12, 15]. therefore,  xxxd2098xxx  could in­
hibit histamine secretion by activating the ^-adrener­
gic receptor on the basophil membrane, which in turn
results in the activation of adenylate cyclase and in
the accumulation of camp. this hypothesis is sup­
ported by the observation that the effects of  xxxd2098xxx 
on both inhibition of histamine release and camp ac­
cumulation are blocked by propranolol, a selective /)blocker.
 xxxd2098xxx  activation of /^-adrenergic receptor is
also suggested by the finding that theophylline, a
camp phosphodiesterase inhibitor, synergistically

marone/ambrosio/bonaduce/genovese/triggiani/condorelli

potentiates both the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on
histamine release and the accumulation of camp.
the synergistic effect of low concentrations of the­
ophylline and  xxxd2098xxx  may be exploited in clinical
practice. both drugs have been shown to be effective
to some extent in inhibiting the in vitro and in vivo
manifestations of human allergic reactions [3, 4, 25,
30], the marked synergism of these drugs in the inhi­
bition of in vitro release of chemical mediators sug­
gests that an association of the two might be benefi­
cial in treating allergic disorders.
it has been previously shown that  xxxd2098xxx  inhi­
bits anti-ige-induced histamine release from human
lung fragments and purified lung mast cells [25].
however, the mechanism underlying histamine re­
lease induced by antigen differs in many aspects from
that induced by anti-ige [18]. we now show that feno­
terol also inhibits histamine release from human
chopped lung challenged with antigen. furthermore,
our data demonstrate that  xxxd2098xxx  is an inhibitor of
antigen-induced histamine release in the basophil sys­
tem, another in vitro model relevant to human ana­
phylaxis [8],  xxxd2098xxx  is a potent bronchodilator [28]
useful in the treatment of allergic reactions in man [5,
26]. our results indicate that  xxxd2098xxx  is a potent inhi­
 xxxd1961xxx  of the ige-mediated release of chemical media­
tors from human basophils and mast cells and that the
effect is mediated by increasing the camp level in
these cells.
the results of the present study suggest a mecha­
nism whereby  xxxd2098xxx  exerts its anti-allergic effects.
chemical mediators released by an ige-dependent
immunological activation of mast cells and basophils
probably play an essential role in human allergic dis­
orders [23]. therefore,  xxxd2098xxx  might prevent anti­
gen-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic pa­
tients by inhibiting mediator release from basophils
and mast cells.
