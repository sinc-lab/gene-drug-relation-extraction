abstract

purpose: endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, are commonly given to most patients with
 xxxg730xxx  (era) ^ positive breast carcinoma but are not indicated for persons
with era-negative cancer. the factors responsible for response to tamoxifen in 5% to 10%
of patients with era-negative tumors are not clear. the aim of the present study was to elucidate the biology and prognostic role of the second er, erh, in patients treated with adjuvant
tamoxifen.
experimental design: we investigated erh by immunohistochemistry in 353 stage ii primary
breast tumors from patients treated with 2 years adjuvant tamoxifen, and generated gene expression profiles for a representative subset of 88 tumors.
results: erh was associated with increased survival (distant disease-free survival, p = 0.01;
overall survival, p = 0.22), and in particular within era-negative patients (p = 0.003;
p = 0.04), but not in the era-positive subgroup (p = 0.49; p = 0.88). lack of erh conferred
early relapse (hazard ratio, 14; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-106; p = 0.01) within the eranegative subgroup even after adjustment for other markers. era was an independent marker
only within the erh-negative tumors (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.89;
p = 0.02). an erh gene expression profile was identified and was markedly different from the
era signature.
conclusion: expression of erh is an independent marker for favorable prognosis after adjuvant
tamoxifen treatment in era-negative breast cancer patients and involves a gene expression
program distinct from era. these results may be highly clinically significant, because in the
united states alone, f10,000 women are diagnosed annually with era-negative/erh-positive
breast carcinoma and may benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen.

estrogens play an important role for the development and
progression of breast carcinoma. their effects on growth and
proliferation are mediated through the two estrogen receptors
(er) a and h (1 – 3), which function as transcription factors
and modulate the expression of target genes in response to
estrogens. the biology of era has been studied for decades
and evaluation of tumor era content is a mainstay of clinical
practice as a marker associated with prognosis and response to
endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen (4).
tamoxifen is a selective er modulator and is the most
frequently prescribed drug for treatment of breast cancer.
tamoxifen is known to inhibit estrogen-stimulated growth of
breast cancer cells by competitively binding to and blocking
era (4). patients with tumors lacking era in general do not
benefit from tamoxifen therapy, although a fraction of eranegative tumors do seem to be sensitive to tamoxifen (5 – 7).
the factors responsible for these responders are debated and no
means of identifying this group is currently known. therefore,
tamoxifen is not indicated for patients with era-negative
tumors in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
since the discovery of erh (3), which has a similar binding
affinity as era for estrogens (8), several studies have focused on
its biological function in relation to era. the two er proteins
share a high degree of homology in the dna-binding regions

but differ considerably in the nh2-terminal activation function
1 region, where interactions with other proteins in the
transcriptional machinery takes place, and to a certain degree
in the ligand-binding region (9), indicating that these receptors
may share some similar functions but may not be entirely
redundant. indeed, they have been shown to respond
differently in ligand-induced activation at activator protein 1
sites (10). in addition, era and erh can exist as a heterodimer
(11 – 13), suggesting a possible role for erh as a modulator of
era activity.
recently, several studies have measured erh in breast cancer
specimens and sought to clarify the relationship between erh
and other clinicopathologic features and its role in response to
endocrine treatment; however, some of the results have been
conflicting and most focused on erh as a resistance marker
in era-positive tumors (refs. 14 – 16, and those reviewed in
ref. 17). erh has been shown to bind tamoxifen (18), and it has
been suggested that low levels of erh associates with tamoxifen
resistance (14). conversely, hopp et al. (15) showed that
expression of erh had a beneficial effect on disease-free and
overall survival in a group of 186 tamoxifen-treated tumors;
however, they found no such association in their set of 119
untreated patients, suggesting a role for erh as a predictive
marker for tamoxifen sensitivity but not as a prognostic marker.
importantly, the patients studied by hopp et al. (15) were
predominantly era-positive and the numbers were limited;

thus, they were unable to perform an analysis stratified by era
status. to our knowledge, no study has investigated the role of
erh as a predictive marker for tamoxifen response for patients
with era-negative tumors.
in the present report, we investigated erh protein levels as
predictor of therapy response in a large patient set, including
both era-positive and era-negative tumors all treated uniformly with 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. furthermore, we
sought to identify a gene expression signature for erh status
and compare it with the era-associated expression signature.

materials and methods
patients. we studied a cohort of 425 women with stage ii breast
cancer collected by the participating departments of the south swedish
health care region after approval of the lund university hospital
ethics committee. these women had been part of two randomized
trials of adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy (19, 20), and were selected
for this study with the following criteria: 2-year tamoxifen treatment
arms (n = 995), complete follow-up data (n = 992), receipt of freshfrozen sample from primary tumor (n = 783), and uniform method for
 xxxg1603xxx  content determination (n = 537). from these, all the
premenopausal women (n = 79) and a random selection of the
postmenopausal women (n = 346) were included in the study. losses
due to nonevaluable erh immunostaining reduced the final cohort to
353 cases (table 1). patients were operated with either modified radical

erb and tamoxifen response
mastectomy or breast conservation surgery in combination with
axillary lymph node dissection. radiotherapy was offered to all
patients treated with breast conservation surgery and to patients with
lymph node metastases treated with modified radical mastectomy.
the median follow-up for patients free from distant recurrence
was 5.7 years and for patients alive at the end of the study was
14.5 years.
erb immunohistochemical analysis. formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor blocks from the 425 cases were used to generate
tissue microarrays, with three 0.6-mm-diameter cores taken per tumor.
antigens were retrieved by heat pretreatment [102jc for 30 min with 1
mmol/l tris edta buffer (ph 9)] in the pt module device (labvision,
fremont, ca). immunostainings were carried out with an autostainer
(labvision) using a cocktail of two monoclonal anti-erh antibodies
(clone 14c8 from genetex, san antonio, tx, which is pan-specific for
erh isoforms, and ppg5/10 from serotec, oxford, united kingdom,
which is specific for erh1), both diluted 1:2,000 from the manufacturers’ stock. powervision+ (immunovision technologies, daly city,
ca) was used for immunodetection according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the diaminobenzidine reaction product was enhanced
with 0.5% copper sulfate for 5 min at room temperature, and the tissue
was counterstained with hematoxylin. losses due to lack of sufficient
invasive tumor cells in the cores or detachment of tissue cores left 353
cases that could be evaluated. the scoring was done
by one person (m.l.), blinded to all patient data, with the score erhnegative (erh ) defined as no to weak staining reaction (over
background) in less than 20% of carcinoma cells, erh moderately
positive (erh+) as weak staining intensity in 20% to 100%, and
erh strongly positive (erh++) as intense staining intensity in 20% to
100%, using high-resolution digitized images and a virtual microscopy
system (21).
determination of other tumor markers. steroid receptor protein
[era and  xxxg1737xxx  (pgr)] determinations using enzyme
immunoassay (22), and flow cytometric analysis of s-phase fraction
and dna ploidy analysis (23), were done as part of the routine tumor
evaluation. era and pgr status, s-phase fraction status, and dna
ploidy status were classified as previously described (22, 24). erbb2
amplification was measured using chromogenic in situ hybridization
analysis (25).
statistical analysis. the m2 test for association and m2 test for trend,
mann-whitney u test, and kruskal-wallis test were used to assess
associations between tumor erh or era content and other variables. all
factors were used as categorized variables in the statistical analysis
except for age, which was also analyzed as a continuous variable. the
kaplan-meier method was used to estimate distant disease-free survival
and overall survival and the log-rank test was used to compare survival
between two strata. the log-rank test for trend was used to compare
survival in more than two strata. to test whether the effects on distant
disease-free survival of era and erh changed significantly with time,
schoenfeld’s test for time dependence was applied. the association of
the level of erh with patient outcome, adjusted for other prognostic
factors and for interaction between erh and era, was assessed in a
multivariate analysis using cox proportional hazards model. all tests
were two-sided and p values <0.05 were considered significant.
statistical analyses were carried out using stata 8.0 (stata corporation,
college station, tx).
microarrays. cdna microarrays with 27,648 spots were produced
in the swegene microarray facility, department of oncology, lund
university. the gene set consisted of 24,301 sequence-verified image
clones (research genetics, huntsville, al) and 1,296 internally
generated clones, together representing 15,000 unigene clusters
(build 180) and 1,200 unclustered expressed sequence tags, and were
pcr amplified using vector-specific primers essentially as previously
described (26) with some modifications. tissue processing for the 88
breast tumor samples, rna labeling, and microarray hybridization
protocols are described in detail in supplementary materials and
methods.

microarray data analysis. microarray data are available through
national center for biotechnology information gene expression
omnibus,6 accession no. gse6577. the erh+ and erh++ tumors were
grouped together and analyzed as a single erh-positive (erh+/++)
entity. thus, the distribution of the 88 tumors between the four era/
erh groups was as follows: 10 era /erh , 36 era /erh+/++,
8 era+/erh and 34 era+/erh+/++.
data analysis was done using bioarray software environment (27).
data preprocessing and filtering procedures, described in the supplementary materials and methods, left 10,493 informative genes. the
genes were ranked based on the signal-to-noise statistic (28), which
calculates a correlation score between gene expression and the tumor
annotation of interest. to evaluate the significance of the expression
signatures between two annotation classes (e.g., erh status), 1,000
permutations were run whereby the samples were randomly given an
annotation label and the p value for a score was calculated as the
average number of reporters exceeding the score in the permutation test,
divided by the total number of reporters in the gene list. the false
discovery rate (fdr) was calculated by random permutations,
controlled according to benjamini et al. (29), and used as an indicator
of the robustness of the gene expression profile. an fdr of 0% indicates
no false positives, whereas an fdr of 100% indicates complete random
signal. to test the dependence of fdr on number of samples for the
erh analysis in the two era status subgroups, two erh-negative and
two erh-positive samples were randomly removed from the eranegative cohort, making both these two groups equal in size to the
corresponding groups in the era-positive cohort. for the reduced
era-negative data set, genes were ranked and fdrs based on 1,000
permutations were calculated; the procedure was repeated 200 times
with different random selections of removed samples. the significance
analysis of microarrays algorithm (30) implemented in tigr multiexperiment viewer 3.1 (31) with 1,000 permutations and default
settings was also used to generate comparative fdr plots. hierarchical
clustering and data visualization are described in the supplementary
materials and methods.

results
association between erb and clinicopathologic variables. we
evaluated total erh protein levels by performing immunohistochemistry using a cocktail of two well-characterized
monoclonal anti-erh antibodies, clones 14c8 and ppg5/10,
previously shown to be the best-performing antibodies for this
application (32). seventy-four percent of the tumors stained
positive for erh (erh+, 54%; erh++, 20%) and 26% were
erh (table 1; supplementary fig. s1). seventy percent of the
tumors were era positive, and the association between the
expression of erh and era was nonsignificant (p = 0.18).
although era positivity was associated with several clinical
variables such as increasing age (p = 0.003), postmenopausal
status (p = 0.007), a greater number of lymph nodes with metastases (p = 0.006), pgr positivity (p < 0.001), a low s-phase
fraction (p < 0.001), and nonamplified erbb2 (p < 0.001),
erh expression did not correlate significantly with any of the
clinical variables tested (table 1). in a subgroup analysis,
increasing erh level was associated with high s-phase fraction
within the era-negative group (p = 0.03) but not with any
other markers (data not shown).
analysis of distant disease-free survival. among all cases,
erh expression was significantly associated with an increased
distant disease-free survival (p = 0.01; fig. 1a). when stratified
by era status, erh level was significantly associated with better

a significantly worse distant disease-free survival for the erh

with a hazard ratio (hr) of 14 [95% confidence interval
(95% ci), 1.8-106; p = 0.01]. between the erh+ and erh++

groups in the era-negative subgroup, there was a similar but
nonsignificant trend (hr, 6.1; 95% ci, 0.79-46; p = 0.08). in
contrast, as extrapolated from the model presented in table 2,
there was no effect of erh on distant disease-free survival in the
era-positive group (fig. 1c), neither between the erh and
erh++ groups (hr, 1.2; 95% ci, 0.57-2.5; p = 0.70) nor
between the erh+ and erh++ groups (hr, 1.0; 95% ci, 0.052.0; p = 1.00). the cox regression model also showed that the
effect of erh++ status (compared with erh ) was significantly
different in the two era subgroups (p = 0.02; table 2).

erb and tamoxifen response

having identified an era-dependent effect for erh, we tested
for the inverse dependency: the correlation of era status with
distant disease-free survival in the whole patient group and in
the different erh subgroups (fig. 1d-g). interestingly, using
the kaplan-meier method and log-rank test, era was significantly associated with a better prognosis exclusively in the
erh subgroup (p = 0.05; fig. 1e) but not in the whole cohort
or any of the other erh subgroups (figs. 1d and f-g,
respectively). from the cox regression model with interaction
between era and erh (table 2), the predictive value of era for
distant disease-free survival in the different erh subgroups
could be interpreted. in agreement with the results from the
kaplan-meier analysis, we found that era positivity was a
significant independent predictive marker for improved distant
disease-free survival only within the erh group (hr, 0.44;
95% ci, 0.21-0.89; p = 0.02), whereas no significant effect was
seen in the other two subgroups (erh+: hr, 0.86; 95% ci,
0.45-1.7; p = 0.70; erh++: hr, 5.2; 95% ci, 0.67-40; p = 0.12).
the effect of erh on distant disease-free survival in the eranegative group did not change significantly with time (p = 0.21;
schoenfeld’s test), whereas the effect of era expression on
distant disease-free survival in the erh group proved to be
time dependent (p = 0.005) and diminished over a long followup time. furthermore, as the distributions of era and pgr
concentrations between the erh subgroups within the eranegative tumors were similar (p = 0.68 for era and p = 0.41 for
pgr, kruskal-wallis test), we concluded that residual low levels
of era or pgr protein in the three erh subgroups did not
contribute to the prognostic effect of erh within the eranegative tumors.
in addition to erh++ status compared with erh in the eranegative subgroup, four or more lymph nodes (compared
with 0) and menopausal status had independent prognostic
value after tamoxifen treatment in the multivariate analysis
(table 2). no other effects were significant; however, erbb2

benjamini et al. (29). x axis, gene ranks.

amplification and erh+ status (compared with erh++) in the
era-negative subgroup showed a tendency (p < 0.10) to carry
prognostic information (table 2). s-phase fraction, age as a

included in the multivariate analysis as they showed no
significant association with distant disease-free survival in
univariate analysis.
analysis of overall survival. using the kaplan-meier method
and log-rank test, a beneficial effect of erh positivity on overall
survival was seen among era-negative tumors (p = 0.04;
fig. 1i) but not in the whole tumor group (p = 0.22; fig. 1h) or
among era positives (p = 0.88; fig. 1j).
gene expression analysis. the erh gene expression signature
in the 88 patients, representative of the original cohort (data
not shown), had an fdr of 49% per top 100 discriminator
genes ranked by the signal-to-noise ratio analysis score (28),
and 50% per top 500 genes, indicating that erh was associated
with a unique, albeit weak, expression profile. the era status –
associated gene expression signature from this data set had no
false-positive genes in the top 1,000 genes. when stratified by
era, erh was associated with a detectable expression profile
within the era-negative group (fdr of 40% per top 100
discriminator genes, and 43% per top 500; fig. 2); however,
there was no signal in the era-positive group (fdr reached
>90% by the top 10 genes; fig. 2). a similar difference in gene
expression signature strength was seen when using the
significance analysis of microarrays algorithm (30) to generate
fdr curves (data not shown).
to investigate whether the absence of an erh-associated
expression profile within the era-positive tumors was due to
the erh signal being masked by the much stronger eraassociated profile, we used the top 50 and top 100 erh genes
generated from the era-negative subgroup and tested whether
they could separate the tumors according to erh status within
the era-positive subgroup using hierarchical clustering analysis. the resulting tumor dendrogram showed a scattered
distribution not correlating to erh levels (data not shown),
whereas using these genes within the era-negative group
displayed erh-associated tumor clusters (result for the top

50 erh genes are shown in fig. 3). the successful erh
discrimination in the era negatives was not due to a difference
in distribution of residual era concentration in the erh
groups, because the distribution of era values in the three
erh subgroups within the era-negative tumors were similar
(p = 0.75) as were the distribution of pgr concentrations
(p = 0.58). moreover, the erh signal in era-negative tumors
was still present even when top 400 era signature genes were
removed before identifying the erh signature (fdr of 42% per
top 100 genes).
furthermore, to test whether the lack of signal for erh in the
era-positive group was due to the lower number of samples in
this group compared with the era-negative group (42 era
positives versus 46 era negatives), samples were randomly
removed from the era-negative cohort, to make the two erh
groups equal in size to the corresponding groups in the
era-positive cohort. in none out of the 200 randomly reduced
era-negative cohorts was the fdr, for top 10 up to top 1,000
genes or more, equal to or larger than that of the era-positive
cohort, indicating that the difference in erh signal strength in
the two era subgroups is robust.
we compared the extent of overlap of genes comprising the
erh and era expression signatures. the two expression profiles
generated from all 88 cases were substantially different: no
genes were overlapping among the respective top 100 ranked
genes; moreover, among the top 1,000 ranked genes, the

overlap was only 6%. the erh signature generated from within
the era-negative tumors, which could be considered a ‘‘purer’’
erh profile, showed a similar degree of nonoverlap with the
era gene list from all cases: 1% in top 100 and 7% in top
1,000.

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first study to show an era
status – specific survival benefit of erh expression in tamoxifentreated breast cancer patients. in light of a previous study
showing no prognostic value of erh in untreated patients (15),
our results suggest that erh is a predictive marker for response
to tamoxifen in era-negative patients.
although era positivity is a well-established predictor of
response to tamoxifen and era-negative patients are considered
nonresponders, it has been noted that 5% to 10% of eranegative tumors do benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen (5 – 7).
several theories have been put forward to explain these cases:
failures or inconsistencies in the performance or evaluation of
era measurements result in miscategorization of what are
actually era-positive tumors, or that tamoxifen acts through
mechanisms independent of era. our results support the latter
and suggest that an era-independent alternative mechanism of
action of tamoxifen is via erh (of note, 17% of era-negative
tumors were strongly positive for erh). furthermore, there was
a similar distribution of era and pgr protein values in the
three erh subgroups within the era-negative tumors, suggesting that misclassification of era-positive tumors did not
confound our results.
although era did not have significant predictive value for
tamoxifen response in the entire patient group over the
complete long follow-up period, era was predictive within
the erh-negative group (p = 0.05, fig. 1e; hr, 0.44; 95% ci,
0.21-0.89; p = 0.02, extrapolated from table 2). moreover, it
appeared that era negativity may confer a better outcome
within the erh strongly positive group (p = 0.09, fig. 1g; hr,
5.2; 95% ci, 0.67-40; p = 0.12, table 2). these findings raise an
intriguing hypothesis that the best tamoxifen response is
achieved when a tumor is expressing either era or erh, but
not both. a biological explanation for this could be that the two
receptors modulate the function of each other, so that when
coexpressed the effect of tamoxifen becomes less pronounced
or, alternatively, is growth promoting. this postulation is
supported by the following observations: the two receptors can
be coexpressed within individual breast carcinoma cells (33);
they can form heterodimers (11 – 13); erh can function as an
inhibitor of era activity under certain conditions (34); and
when coexpressed with era, erh has been suggested to be
associated with tumor characteristics indicative of a poorer
prognosis (35).
despite the similar utility of erh or era as markers for
benefit from tamoxifen therapy in this study group, the two
receptors show many dissimilarities. within all cases, era
expression correlates strongly with the majority of other
standard clinicopathologic markers, whereas erh expression
did not, corroborating the results of recent studies (15, 16).
erh did, however, correlate with high s-phase fraction within
the era-negative group, which is consistent with the literature
showing an association between erh and the proliferation
marker ki67 (16, 36). an erh-dependent high proliferation

erb and tamoxifen response

rate of these tumor cells may render them more sensitive to
tamoxifen therapy (37).
we have previously shown that era status in breast cancer is
associated with a robust gene expression signature (38), and the
most readily apparent subdivision of breast cancers based on
gene expression data is according to era status (39, 40). the
present study is the first to identify an erh-associated gene
expression profile in human tumor biopsies. the lack of erhassociated signal in era-positive tumors suggests that erh
seems to be less influential on gene expression, and hence
tumor biology, in cancers also expressing era. however, this
does not necessarily rule out that erh under certain conditions
can have some modulating effect on era. our results indicate
that the erh gene expression signature was markedly different
from the era gene expression signature as the genes included in
the two profiles showed minimal overlap. however, due to the
limited sample size in this study, these findings call for further
validation in data sets including larger number of tumors.
together, our data suggests that erh, in the absence of era, is
not simply a surrogate marker for era, but rather erh may
affect growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells through
modulation of different downstream target genes.
as far as we are aware, this is the largest survival study of erh
in breast cancer specimens to date. it will be important to
confirm our results in other cohorts containing large numbers
of era-negative tumors treated uniformly with tamoxifen. it
remains to be tested whether a predictive effect of erh exists for
patients treated with other selective er modulators or other
types of endocrine therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors.

moreover, analysis of large series of untreated patients is
necessary to confirm that erh does not have prognostic value
(15) and is specifically a predictive marker for therapeutic
response to tamoxifen. in this regard and suggesting that the
erh benefit may indeed be related to antiestrogen therapy, a
recent study of era-negative breast tumor patients that received
varied therapies (<35% received unspecified hormonal therapies alone or in combination) found no recurrence-free survival
benefit for erh expression (16).
in the present study, we categorized erh status into three
groups with the goal of understanding the influence of different
levels of erh expression on survival for tamoxifen-treated
patients. further refinement will be needed to identify optimal
and standardized methods for determining erh content,
scoring, and thresholds, and whether different erh variants
modulate response dissimilarly.
from our data, it can be estimated that in the united states
alone, f10,000 patients per year will be diagnosed with eranegative/erh-positive breast carcinoma. given the relatively
low toxicity and cost of tamoxifen, our results have striking
clinical implications that motivate further studies to explore the
efficacy of tamoxifen to treat era-negative/erh-positive breast
tumors.
