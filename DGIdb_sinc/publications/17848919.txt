atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects:
insights from receptor-binding profiles
ha nasrallah
department of psychiatry, university of cincinnati college of medicine, cincinnati, oh, usa
atypical antipsychotic drugs offer several notable benefits over typical antipsychotics,
including greater improvement in negative symptoms, cognitive function, prevention of
deterioration, and quality of life, and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (eps). however,
concerns about eps have been replaced by concerns about other side effects, such as
weight gain, glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia. these side effects are associated with
potential long-term cardiovascular health risks, decreased medication adherence, and may
eventually lead to clinical deterioration. despite a greater understanding of the biochemical
effects of these drugs in recent years, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying their
various therapeutic properties and related side effects remain unclear. besides dopamine d2
receptor antagonism, a characteristic feature of all atypical antipsychotic drugs, these agents
also bind to a range of non-dopaminergic targets, including serotonin, glutamate, histamine,
a-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. this review examines the potential contribution of
different receptors to metabolic side effects associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment
for all seven agents currently marketed in the united states (risperidone, olanzapine,
quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole,  xxxd2830xxx  and clozapine) and another agent
( xxxd336xxx ) in clinical development at the time of this publication.

introduction
atypical antipsychotics are currently the most frequently prescribed class of drugs for schizophrenia.1
published evidence indicates that these agents provide antipsychotic efficacy with a lower risk of
extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) than typical antipsychotics.2 although the use of atypical antipsychotics offers many benefits and may reduce some of the
factors related to the morbidity and mortality of
schizophrenia, these drugs appear to be associated
with varying degrees of metabolic adverse effects,
such as weight gain, impaired glucose metabolism,
dyslipidemia and in some cases, more serious
morbidity, such as cardiovascular disease.3,4 moreover, a number of epidemiological studies of patients
with schizophrenia have documented a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than in the general
population, and patients with schizophrenia may be
at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease even in
the absence of antipsychotic treatment.5–7 this is
likely due to higher rates of unhealthy lifestyle,
obesity, lipid abnormalities, diabetes, hypertension,

physical inactivity, poor compliance and smoking in
this population.5,8,9 consequently, it is important that
health care professionals work together to monitor the
metabolic functioning of patients with schizophrenia,
who are at high risk for metabolic disorders.10 health
care professionals also need to be aware of the
potential metabolic impact of current pharmacologic
treatments for schizophrenia.
the specific binding profiles of atypical antipsychotics vary greatly. each drug has unique pharmacological properties, including activity at multiple
receptors.11 this complex pharmacology leads to
interactions of varying intensity with numerous
serotonergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic
and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. the specific
binding profile of different antipsychotic agents may
help explain the occurrence of particular side effects
associated with each drug. for example, drug affinity
at the  xxxg1078xxx  is linked to weight gain,
whereas affinity at muscarinic receptors is linked to
anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth,
constipation and blurred vision.12–16 thus, differences in receptor-affinity profiles may explain differences in side-effect profiles (as well as efficacy)
between specific agents within this heterogeneous
class of drugs.
the study of antipsychotic receptor binding is
relatively new and still evolving. although the
specific receptor-binding profile of various atypical

agents is increasingly well understood, in some cases,
the link between receptor binding and a specific
clinical effect has not been definitively established.
this review focuses on current knowledge regarding
the relative contribution of various neurotransmitter
receptors to the metabolic side effects of atypical
antipsychotic drugs. it is important to note that a
complete understanding of the role that specific
receptor-binding relationships play in understanding
both metabolic and other side effects will require a
significant amount of further research that expands
upon not only the understanding of the receptor
subtypes discussed in this review, but also upon those
subtypes for which current research is absent.
receptor-binding profiles of atypical antipsychotics
typical antipsychotics are universally characterized
by their antagonistic effect and high affinity for
dopamine receptors, particularly d2 receptors. dopamine antagonism is believed to be the mechanism of
these agents’ ability to reduce positive symptoms of
schizophrenia as well as their tendency to produce
eps. atypical antipsychotics, in contrast, are antagonists for both serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht)
and dopamine receptors.17 in general, atypical agents
have an enhanced 5-ht2a/d2 affinity ratio, a chartable 1

acteristic that distinguishes atypical from typical
antipsychotics better than any other known pharmacologic feature and a characteristic that helps explain
why typical and atypical agents may have different
clinical effects.18 for example, both risperidone and
olanzapine have relatively high 5-ht2a receptorblocking activity but relatively lower affinities for
the  xxxg656xxx , particularly compared with
the affinities for the  xxxg656xxx  of typical antipsychotics, and treatment with both risperidone and
olanzapine is associated with fewer eps than treatment with haloperidol, a stronger d2 antagonist.19,20
the atypical antipsychotics generally have additional affinities for a variety of neurotransmitter
receptor subtypes, including other serotonin ( xxxg1108xxx , 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx  and  xxxg1120xxx ) and dopamine
receptors (d1, d3 and d4), as well as the histamine
receptor h1, muscarinic receptors ( xxxg447xxx , m2, m3, m4 and
m5) and adrenergic receptors (a1 and a2).11 the
receptor-binding profiles of six marketed atypical
antipsychotic drugs (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) are
presented in table 1. these data, expressed as

exhaustive investigation of the receptor-binding profiles of all currently marketed atypical agents.
atypical antipsychotics currently in development,
such as  xxxd336xxx , also act at multiple-receptor sites
(figure 1).  xxxd336xxx  exhibits high affinity for
human dopamine d2, d3, d4 and serotonin 5-ht1a
receptors, moderate affinity for m opiate, adrenergic
a2a- and adrenergic a2c-receptors, low affinity for
a1- and muscarinic receptors, and virtually no affinity
for serotonin 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c and histaminergic h1
receptors.21,22 in comparison, data available on the
most recently marketed atypical antipsychotic,  xxxd2830xxx  (9-hydroxy-risperidone), the active metabolite of risperidone, indicate that it binds with similar
affinity as  xxxd336xxx  to d2 receptors and with greater
affinity to 5-ht2a receptors (figure 1).  xxxd2830xxx 
is also active as an antagonist at adrenergic a1- and
a2-receptors and histaminergic h1 receptors, and has
no affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or adrenergic
b1- and b2-receptors.23,24 such differentiation between
antipsychotic agents in receptor pharmacology may
contribute to distinct efficacy and safety profiles in
patients with schizophrenia.
in addition to having distinct binding profiles,
some atypical antipsychotics have a unique effect on
neurotransmitter receptor activity. while typical
antipsychotics and most atypical drugs are dopamine
antagonists that block dopaminergic systems throughout the brain,17 some agents, such as aripiprazole and
 xxxd336xxx , act as partial dopamine agonists.25 partial
agonists have a lower intrinsic activity at neurotransmitter receptors than full agonists, and thus do not
induce a maximal response. in addition, partial
agonists may act either as functional agonists or
antagonists, depending on the surrounding levels of
endogenous neurotransmitter. in the absence of a full

agonist, a partial agonist demonstrates functionally
agonistic effects; however, if a full agonist is present, a
partial agonist shows antagonistic activity.25 it has
been suggested that such partial agonism may treat a
broader range of schizophrenic symptomatology. for
example, while the positive symptoms of schizophrenia appear to be associated with hyperactive subcortical dopamine pathways, some models attribute the
negative symptoms to hypoactive cortical dopaminergic systems.25 partial dopamine agonism may stabilize
dysregulated dopamine systems by applying antagonistic and agonistic effects to the subcortical and
cortical dopaminergic systems, respectively, thereby
regulating different types of dopaminergic dysfunction
and effecting both positive and negative symptoms.
certain atypical antipsychotics also act as partial
agonists at other sites in addition to dopamine
receptor sites. aripiprazole, ziprasidone and  xxxd336xxx , for example, each display partial agonism at
5-ht1a receptors.17,25 similarly, a number of reports
have noted that clozapine is a partial agonist of  xxxg447xxx ,
m2 and m4 muscarinic receptors and an antagonist of
m3 and m5.16,26,27 further, the major active metabolite
of clozapine, n-desmethylclozapine, acts as a partial
agonist at m5, a full agonist at  xxxg447xxx  and an antagonist at
m3 receptors.27 according to dean et al.,28 some postmortem studies in subjects with schizophrenia show
regionally specific reductions in the density of muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system, supporting the argument that selective muscarinic receptor
agonism (to compensate for reduced receptor density)
may be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia.
the finding that antipsychotic medications interact
with multiple neurotransmitter receptors is consistent
with the fact that such drugs have clinical effects
beyond their antipsychotic efficacy. to maximize

efficacy and minimize side effects, the main goal of
drug discovery during the past few decades has been
to develop drugs with high target selectivity. consequently, a number of attempts have been made to
develop antipsychotic drugs that target a single
receptor without raising the risk of severe side effects
associated with such multiple-receptor drugs as
clozapine. compounds selective for either d2, d3,
d4, 5-ht2a, muscarinic receptors, glutamate receptors
or adrenoreceptors have been tested for their efficacy
in treating schizophrenia; virtually none has proven
to be clinically effective.11 an exception to these
findings has been seen with the highly selective d3/d2
receptor antagonist,  xxxd155xxx , which is currently
marketed in europe. compared with typical antipsychotics, several studies have demonstrated  xxxd155xxx ’s significantly improved efficacy in terms of
global schizophrenia symptoms, with a trend toward
greater efficacy regarding negative symptoms, as well
as fewer extrapyramidal effects and study dropouts.29,30  xxxd3096xxx , another clinically effective,
highly selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, was withdrawn from the market in 1994 because of an
association with aplastic anemia.31,32
overall, evidence to date regarding the atypical
antipsychotics currently available on the us market
does not support development of a ‘magic bullet’ that
would bind to a single receptor. rather, to alleviate
effectively the symptoms of schizophrenia, agents
that bind to multiple targets are being pursued in the
belief that they will offer greater therapeutic advantages. roth et al.11 have referred to this as the ‘magic
shotgun’ approach to schizophrenia treatment.
because us clinicians rely currently on atypical
antipsychotic agents that act at multiple sites, a
close examination of neurotransmitter receptor subtypes that are associated with the most common
metabolic complications would be of great clinical
value.10 this subject is explored below under the
headings of weight gain, glucose dysregulation and
dyslipidemia.

weight gain
weight gain is a common feature of antipsychotic
drug treatment.33 most atypical antipsychotics are
associated with greater weight gain liability than their
typical counterparts. the molecular mechanisms
responsible for antipsychotic-induced weight gain
are not fully known. there is ample evidence,
however, that binding to certain neurotransmitter
receptors may at least partly explain antipsychoticassociated weight gain.34 a meta-analysis by allison
et al.35 determined that patients receiving standard
doses of most antipsychotic drugs experienced weight
gain versus placebo after 10 weeks and that the
amount of weight gain varied by agent, most likely
reflecting differing degrees of action on serotonergic,
dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other
neurotransmitter systems (figure 2). in this analysis,
patients given clozapine and olanzapine treatment
had the greatest weight gain. these results were
recently confirmed in active comparator studies
comparing weight gain in patients treated with
different atypical antipsychotics.2,36,37
weight gain patterns seem to vary over the length of
treatment with different antipsychotic agents.3
although long-term studies indicate that ziprasidone-induced weight gain is limited to approximately
1 kg (2.2 lb) over the first year of treatment, use of
quetiapine and risperidone is associated with gains of
2–3 kg (4.4–6.6 lb) over the same period.38 in patients
given aripiprazole for 52 weeks, weight change was
related to baseline body mass index (bmi). patients
with baseline bmi of > 27 exhibited a mean weight
loss of 1.2 kg ( 2.6 lb), whereas those with a bmi
of 23–27 exhibited a mean weight increase of 1.4 kg
(3.1 lb) and those with a bmi < 23 gained a mean
2.6 kg (5.7 lb).39 a small, 10-month trial of clozapine
in treatment-resistant patients revealed mean weight
gain of 12.4 kg (27.3 lb) in the six responders.40 weight
gain associated with antipsychotic drug use is
frequently of clinical significance. at standard doses
of olanzapine, mean weight gain ranged from 6.8 to

11.8 kg (15.1–26.2 lb) during the first year of treatment,
with many patients gaining more than 20% of their
initial body weight, while a 15 mg/day dose of
olanzapine resulted in mean weight gain of 12 kg
(26.4 lb) over 12 months.34,41 similarly, pooled data
from studies on weight change with antipsychotic use
revealed that 24–37% of olanzapine-treated patients
experienced weight gain of x7% of their body weight.36
importantly, patients who experience antipsychotic-induced weight increases exhibit elevated rates of
morbidity and reduced treatment compliance, even if
the psychopharmacological treatment is effective.42,43
for example, in the clinical antipsychotic trial of
intervention effectiveness (catie) study, a large-scale
naturalistic, prospective trial comparing the effectiveness of typical and atypical agents, the rate of
discontinuation due to weight gain or metabolic
effects with olanzapine was more than twice that
of any other study medication (9 versus 1–4%,
p < 0.001).44 moreover, a recent report noted that
olanzapine therapy in patients with first episode
schizophrenia causes an increase in central body fat
deposition that is associated with raised triglyceride
and insulin levels.45 because this type of weight gain
is often coupled with insulin resistance,46 it is a
significant long-term health issue. taken together,
these results suggest that drug choice may have a
considerable impact on patient weight and health.
thus, switching to antipsychotics with a reduced
propensity to cause weight gain may be a useful
strategy for patients with schizophrenia who have
gained excessive weight on other agents.3,47
emerging data suggest that  xxxd336xxx , an investigational atypical antipsychotic, may be associated
with weight decreases at least comparable to those of
placebo,48–51 a feature that may be related to this
agent’s receptor-binding profile and/or partial agonist
activity at d2 and 5-ht1a receptors. while further
confirmation is needed, this finding represents an
example of an atypical antipsychotic that may result
in weight decrease versus placebo.
a number of studies have examined the relationship between neurotransmitter receptor-binding profiles and weight gain (table 2). for example, kroeze

et al.,52 found that affinity for h1 receptors closely
correlates with antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
this finding has subsequently been confirmed by
others,53–55 and is consistent with data demonstrating
that  xxxg1078xxx  antagonism promotes
feeding in rodents and that h1 knockout mice are
prone to weight gain.55–57 recently, kim et al.55
showed that atypical orexigenic antipsychotics selectively and potently stimulate hypothalamic adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (amp
kinase), an enzyme involved in regulating food
intake,58 while reversing the actions of leptin, an
anorexigenic hormone. this effect is mediated through
the  xxxg1078xxx : clozapine augmentation of
amp kinase was abolished in h1 knockout mice and
the orexigenic potencies of various atypical antipsychotics were found to correlate with their affinity for
the  xxxg1078xxx , with olanzapine and clozapine having
the highest affinities in animal models.55 this work
suggests a compelling mechanism for the weight gaininducing properties of some atypical antipsychotics,
although it may not explain their effect fully. for
example, matsui-sakata et al.53 also reported correlations between drug affinity for d2, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2c and
a2-adrenergic receptors and weight gain. drugs with
high h1-receptor affinity also have sedative effects,
leading some investigators to speculate that sedation
may induce weight gain because of reduced mobility.59
genetic variation may also influence antipsychotic
drug-induced weight gain. for example, treatmentnaive patients with a variant of the  xxxg1115xxx 
gene are less likely to experience significant weight
gain following olanzapine or risperidone therapy than
those with the wild-type polymorphism.60–62 similar
results were observed in treatment-experienced
patients;63–65 however, conflicting reports exist.66–68
5-ht2a and  xxxg1119xxx  polymorphisms in treatment-naive
and refractory patients, respectively, have also been
associated with weight gain following risperidone but
not clozapine therapy.62,69 in addition, weight gain
tends to be less pronounced in treatment-experienced
patients,36 and thus, prior treatment may mask weight
gain associated with genetic polymorphisms. such
studies suggest that pharmacogenetics may play a key
role in optimizing the treatment of individual patients
with schizophrenia in the future.

31

glucose dysregulation
epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased risk of diabetes in schizophrenia patients
treated with many atypical antipsychotics.70 in addition, it has been estimated that patients with schizophrenia, even if drug naive, are 2–3 times more likely
to have type ii diabetes than adults in the general
population.71 moreover, diabetes is frequently undiagnosed and undertreated in patients with schizophrenia, and screening methods vary significantly
among different clinical studies.71,72 consequently, it
is difficult to gauge the extent to which diabetes and
other abnormalities in glucose metabolism result from

the disease itself or from treatment with a specific
antipsychotic medication.
the earliest reports linking atypical antipsychotic
drugs to an increased risk of hyperglycemia or
diabetes were based on case reports and small case
series in patients treated with olanzapine and
clozapine.73–75 in most instances, hyperglycemia was
reversed when treatment ended and reappeared when
treatment was resumed.73,76
although there are conflicting reports in the
literature, several studies have suggested a relationship between certain antipsychotic drugs and an
increased risk of diabetes.71,77 in a retrospective, casematched, controlled study of over 8000 inpatients,
citrome et al.78 found that patients taking atypical
antipsychotics, such as clozapine or quetiapine, had a
significantly greater risk of developing diabetes than
those receiving typical antipsychotics. similarly, a
large population study of over 56 000 patients receiving antipsychotic medication through the us department of veterans affairs revealed that the risk of
diabetes was higher in patients taking clozapine or
olanzapine than in recipients of typical antipsychotics.79 another retrospective study involving 100 000
medicaid patients found that the estimated risk of
diabetes in patients receiving antipsychotics depended on study design; that is, in studies that
screened patients for pre-existing diabetes, selected
those on monotherapy and identified diabetes with
prescription claims, only olanzapine and clozapine
were associated with an increased risk of glucose
dysregulation.80
besides retrospective trials, several randomized,
controlled, prospective studies have also examined
the relationship between diabetes, schizophrenia and
antipsychotic medication usage. the catie study
found that patients treated with olanzapine had
significantly higher levels of glycosylated hemoglobin
and blood glucose than those treated with perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone.43,44
other prospective studies have noted an increased
risk of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia treated
with clozapine.81 these findings bolster those of prospective trials in which schizophrenia itself was found
to be a contributing factor in metabolic syndrome,
with as many as 43% of patients having the condition.82,83 metabolic syndrome includes, among other
things, risk factors such as abdominal obesity, elevated fasting triglyceride levels and insulin resistance,
all of which have been implicated in the development
of diabetes and coronary heart disease.82,84
recent studies have analyzed the potential relationship between antipsychotic drug affinity for specific
receptor subtypes and diabetes (table 2). for example, matsui-sakata et al.53 reported that antipsychotic
drug affinities for 5-ht2c, h1 and muscarinic receptors are associated with an increased risk of diabetes.
indeed, atypical antipsychotics, excluding ziprasidone and  xxxd336xxx , have relatively high affinities
(pki > 7) for the  xxxg1078xxx .11,21 in addition, although
aripiprazole, quetiapine and  xxxd336xxx  each have

molecular psychiatry

low affinity for the  xxxg1115xxx , most antipsychotic agents have a high affinity for this receptor (table 1
and figure 1).11,21
because atypical antipsychotic drugs generally
have a higher binding affinity for 5-ht receptors than
d2 receptors (table 1), therapeutic doses often
saturate 5-ht receptors to achieve sufficient d2
occupancy for therapeutic effect. wirshing et al.85
have proposed a serotonergic model for clozapine and
olanzapine-induced diabetes, which they based on
animal models showing that 5-ht1a antagonism
decreases pancreatic b-cell responsiveness, thereby
decreasing insulin secretion and increasing serum
glucose levels. work in healthy volunteers has since
shown that 5-ht2 antagonists can significantly decrease insulin sensitivity compared with placebo
(p = 0.047), an effect possibly mediated by the suppression of  xxxg1113xxx -mediated glucose uptake
in skeletal muscle.86 it should be noted, however, that
most atypical antipsychotics have stronger antagonistic effects at 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c than at 5-ht1a,85 and
that 5-ht2c antagonism is most closely correlated
with an increased risk of diabetes and weight gain.53
consistent with this notion, 5-ht2c knockout mice
develop insulin resistance and impaired glucose
tolerance and experience severe weight gain.87
in addition to serotonin receptors, histamine and
muscarinic receptors may also be associated with an
increased risk of diabetes. a meta-analysis by matsuisakata et al.53 indicated that disruption of h1 function
may interfere with leptin-mediated appetite suppression, an effect that could lead to weight gain and
insulin resistance. moreover, silvestre and prous88
found that antipsychotic drug affinity for muscarinic
m3 receptors is a significant predictor of the development of diabetes. this finding is supported by the
fact that m3 is highly expressed by pancreatic b-cells,
where it is thought to play a central role in regulating
glucose-dependent acetylcholine modulation of insulin secretion. in accordance with this view, mice
with targeted deletions in the m3 gene have reduced
basal levels of insulin and glucagons.88 johnson et
al.89 also found that low concentrations of olanzapine
and clozapine (but not risperidone or ziprasidone)
can markedly and selectively impair cholinergicstimulated insulin secretion by blocking muscarinic
m3 receptors in isolated rat islet cells. in vitro binding
and functional data also showed that olanzapine and
clozapine, unlike the other two atypical agents or
haloperidol, are potent muscarinic m3 antagonists. it
should be noted, however, that selective m3 antagonists used to treat patients with urinary incontinence
have not been associated with a higher risk of
diabetes.88 it may thus be possible that m3 antagonism
is only a precipitating factor in individuals predisposed to the development of diabetes, such as
patients with schizophrenia.
clearly, a broad array of receptors is implicated in
the tendency of certain atypical antipsychotics to
increase the risk of diabetes. in a recent crosssectional study involving non-obese patients with

receptor-binding profiles of atypical antipsychotics
ha nasrallah

schizophrenia on long-term antipsychotic treatment,
henderson et al.37 demonstrated that both olanzapine
and clozapine were associated with significant insulin resistance and impaired glucose effectiveness
compared with risperidone. findings regarding olanzapine have since been corroborated in a similarly
designed study using matched normal controls.90
dyslipidemia
patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk for
dyslipidemia, in part because of poor diet and
sedentary lifestyle. dyslipidemia can also be exacerbated by certain antipsychotic medications.5 the
available data indicate that an increase in serum
lipids is associated with an increase in body weight;
therefore, agents associated with the lowest increase
in body weight would also be expected to have a
lesser risk of inducing serum lipid changes, but this
concept requires further investigation. recent studies
have shown that clozapine, olanzapine and, to a
lesser extent, quetiapine are associated with elevations in triglyceride and total cholesterol levels,
whereas risperidone and aripiprazole have minimal
or no effect on these lipid parameters.91 in both shortand longer-term studies, patients treated with  xxxd336xxx  experienced mean reductions of up to 24% in
fasting triglyceride levels and 8% in fasting total
cholesterol levels.34,48–51
the receptor-binding profiles that most closely
correlate with antipsychotic-associated dyslipidemia
are unclear, although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars), transcriptional regulators of
lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, may play a role.92
a number of reports have suggested a link between
the ppars and diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and
inflammation. a study by arulmozhi et al.92 showed
that the antidiabetic agents  xxxd2203xxx  and rosiglitazone, both of which are  xxxg1805xxx  agonists, and the
hypolipidemic agent  xxxd2096xxx , an agonist of  xxxg1807xxx ,
significantly reversed the increase in triglycerides
observed in response to the antipsychotics chlorpromazine, clozapine and ziprasidone. these agents also
reduced increases in insulin resistance and glucose
levels, at least for some of the antipsychotics
studied.92  xxxd2203xxx , rosiglitazone and  xxxd2096xxx 
have different ppar-binding profiles and thus receptor activation can lead to an increase or decrease in
target gene transcription. for example, binding of the
 xxxg1805xxx  receptor results in transcription of genes
involved in fatty acid uptake and oxidation, inflammation and vascular function, whereas  xxxg1807xxx  binding upregulates genes involved in fatty acid uptake
and storage, inflammation and glucose homeostasis.93

conclusions
atypical antipsychotic drugs vary greatly in their
pharmacology and in their risk of specific adverse
effects. adverse effects such as weight gain and
glucose dysregulation not only add another layer of
complexity for physicians managing a patient with

schizophrenia, but also may have serious prognostic
and cost implications with respect to the incidence of
treatment-related diabetes and cardiovascular disease. a number of recent studies have examined the
receptor-binding profiles of atypical antipsychotics to
determine which sites are most closely linked with
side effects such as weight gain, glucose dysregulation, diabetes and dyslipidemia. affinity for the h1
receptor is most closely linked to increased weight
gain, although affinity for d2, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2c and a2receptors may also be involved.52,53 drug affinity for
the h1, m3 and 5-ht2c receptors is correlated with an
increased risk of diabetes.53,94 the receptor-binding
profiles that correlate with antipsychotic-associated
dyslipidemia are not well understood; however,
emerging evidence suggests that ppar agonism may
convey a therapeutic benefit.92 improved understanding of both the receptor-binding profiles of antipsychotic drugs and the associated side effects may help
guide clinicians in tailoring treatment to the needs of
individual patients and encourage baseline screening
and routine monitoring of patient weight, fasting
plasma glucose and lipid profile.
