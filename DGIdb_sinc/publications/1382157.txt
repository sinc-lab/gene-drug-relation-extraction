summary: we investigated pressor sensitivity to infused
phenylephrine (pe), 0.05 to 0.4 wg/kg/min, and angioten-
sin ii (ang ii), 2.5 to 10 ng/kg/min, in 35 patients with
mild-to-moderate hypertension, before and at the end of
a 4-week treatment period with the angiotensin-convert-
ing enzyme (ace) inhibitor,  xxxd1694xxx , 2.5 or 5.0 mg/day.
 xxxd1694xxx  lowered the mean systolic and diastolic blood
pressure by 10.6/3.5 mm hg, but had no effect on the
dose-response curves of dose of pe or ang ii vs. the
increase in systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure, or
heart rate. there were also no significant effects of cil-
azapril on pd» values, i.e., the dose of pe or ang ii
required to increase mean arterial blood pressure (map)

there seemed to be evidence from animal studies
on which to base a prediction that treatment of pa-
tients with arterial hypertension with an angioten-
sin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor would alter
pressor sensitivity to a-adrenoceptor agonists and
to  xxxg99xxx  (ang ij). in pithed rats, there were
decreased pressor responses to sympathetic acti-
vation and to intravenous norepinephrine (ne) fol-
lowing treatment with the ace inhibitors  xxxd3237xxx 
(1), captopril, ramiprilat, and the ang ii antagonist
saralasin, but not by the b,- and b2-antagonists, ne-
bivolol and ici 118, 551, respectively (2). however,
in patients with hypertension, enalapril increased
pressor responsiveness to the a,-adrenoceptor ag-
onist, phenylephrine (pe) (3).

it seemed likely, also, that ang ii pressor sen-
sitivity would be increased in patients on ace in-
hibitor therapy, on the basis of the general principle
that a sustained decrease in endogenous agonist
concentration will result in an upregulation of the
corresponding receptor. enalapril increased re-

by 20 mm hg, or on ar-r/amap (ratio of the increase
of the ecg r-r interval to the increase in mean arterial
blood pressure) as a measure of baroreflex sensitivity.
plasma renin activity was significantly increased by cil-
azapril therapy, but there were no changes in plasma con-
centrations of ang ii or atrial natriuretic factor. we con-
clude that  xxxd1694xxx , an ace inhibitor, does not alter a,-
adrenoceptor and ang ii receptor sensitivity to selective
agonists, nor does it affect baroreflex sensitivity. key
words: a-adrenergic receptor agonists—angiotensin
i]—  xxxd1694xxx — hypertension— phenylephrine— angio-
tensin receptors.

sponsiveness to infused ang ii in hypertensive pa-
tients (3). on the other hand, the often-confirmed
finding in the rat and in humans with established
hypertension that the ang ii pressor dose-response
curve is shifted upwards would lead to the predic-
tion that reversal of the hypertension, and, possibly,
the elevated plasma ang ii levels, by an ace in-
hibitor would cause the exogenous ang ii pressor
dose-response curve to shift downwards.

we therefore studied the effect of  xxxd1694xxx , an
ace inhibitor, taken by patients with mild-to-mod-
erate hypertension, on the pressor sensitivity to in-
fused pe and ang ii.

methods

study design

the study design was 2 weeks of placebo therapy fol-
lowed by a double-blind 4-week active treatment period
with  xxxd1694xxx , randomized into two dosage groups, 2.5
and 5.0 mg/day, as monotherapy.

a total of 40 patients, of whom 35 were assessed as
evaluable, were entered into the study. they were all out-
patient volunteers, with mild-to-moderate essential hy-
pertension, who fulfilled the selection criteria, and who
gave their informed, written consent to participate in the
study. the protocol was approved by the johannesburg
hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committee and the
university of the witwatersrand committee for research
on human subjects.

selection criteria included sitting mean diastolic blood
pressure (phase v) of 95-115 mm hg at visit week —1
and 0 of the placebo period. patients were excluded if
their age was below 18 or over 75 years, if there was any
history of severe, malignant, or complicated hyperten-
sion, coronary artery disease, or any other major illness,
if they were women of child-bearing potential, or if there
was a history of sensitivity to any drugs. during the pla-
cebo period, all active medication was discontinued, and
the patients were seen weekly. during the 4-week active
treatment period, the patients were seen at weeks 2 and
4. at each visit, sitting and standing systolic and diastolic
blood pressures were recorded, using an automated blood
pressure instrument (lifestat 200, physio control, red-
mond, wa, u.s.a.), as well as sitting and standing heart
rate, weight, and a symptom questionnaire. at the start
and at the end of the active treatment period, there was
also a full physical examination, laboratory investigations
including a 12-item biochemistry profile, full blood count,
and urinalysis, and measurements of plasma renin activity
(pra) and plasma concentrations of ang ii and atrial na-
triuretic factor (anf).

pe and ang ii pressor sensitivity

pe and ang ii sensitivities were also determined at the
beginning and at the end of the active treatment period.
blood pressure was measured using a standard sphyg-
momanometer. mean arterial blood pressure (map) was
defined as diastolic blood pressure plus one-third of the
pulse pressure. following a 30-min stabilization period
with an intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose in water (5-
10 ml/h of infusion) in the supine position, pe was infused
at increasing rates, at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 pg/kg of body
mass/min. each rate was maintained for at least 10 min,
in the last 5 min of which three measurements of blood
pressure and heart rate were obtained. the patients then
had another 15-min period with 5% dextrose in water
only. if at the end of that period the map had stabilized
at pre-pe infusion baseline values, the second phase of
the study, namely the ang ii dose-response phase, was
commenced. using the same protocol as with the pe, the
ang ii dose-response relationship was determined using
2.5, 5, and 10 ng/kg/min intravenously. dose-response
curves were constructed for the dose of the pressor agent
vs. the increase (a value) in systolic, diastolic, and map
and heart rate. the pdyo, i.e., the pe or ang ii pressor
dose required to increase the mean arterial pressure by
20 mm hg, was also calculated. we also plotted asystolic
blood pressure vs. ar-r interval [where r-r interval in
ms = (60/hr)1,000], as a measure of baroreceptor sen-
sitivity (4).

in all cases, we compared values at the beginning and
at the end of the active treatment period, using the paired
t test with the bonferroni adjustment and the wilcoxon
two-sample test, with differences in means assessed as
significant when p < 0.05.

results

thirty-five patients, 18 women and 17 men, with
a mean age of 60.4 + 1.5 years and mean body mass
of 78.1 + 2.5 kg were evaluated. pretreatment ar-
terial blood pressure was 162.9 + 3.8 mm hg sys-
tolic and 98.0 + 1.9 mm hg diastolic.

there were no significant differences in any of
the parameters studied between the two groups of
patients that received 2.5 and 5.0 mg/day of cila-
 xxxd1694xxx ; consequently, the two groups were pooled
for the purpose of data analysis.

there were significant (p < 0.05) falls in systolic,
mean, and diastolic blood pressure over the 4 weeks
of  xxxd1694xxx  therapy (fig. 1). systolic blood pres-
sure fell from 162.9 + 3.8 to 152.3 + 3.4 mm hg,
and diastolic blood pressure fell from 98.8 + 1.9 to
95.3 + 2.0 mm hg. there was no significant change
in mean heart rate.

figures 2 and 3 show the infusion rate of pe or
ang ii vs. the increase in systolic, diastolic, or mean
blood pressure or heart rate.  xxxd1694xxx  does not sig-
nificantly affect blood pressure or heart rate re-
sponses to both pe and ang ii, with no significant
shift of the dose-response curves.

these data are supported by the analysis of the
values for pd (table 1). there are no significant
differences in mean values of pd between the start
and the end of  xxxd1694xxx  therapy with respect to both
pe and ang ii, and in patients on both doses of
 xxxd1694xxx .

baroreceptor sensitivity, assessed as ar-r/
amap in ms/mm hg, was unchanged over the 4
weeks of  xxxd1694xxx  therapy, measured by the r-r

interval and blood pressure responses to both pe
and ang ii (table 2). values for ar-r/amap were
much higher if pe was used as the test agent than
for ang ii; pe caused a demonstrable reflex brad-
ycardia, while ang ii did not (see also figs. 2 and
3). this could be explained on the basis of a positive
chronotropic effect of ang ii. measurements of
pra and the plasma concentrations of ang ii and
anf are shown in table 3. as expected, the ace
inhibitor caused a significant increase in pra, but,
surprisingly, there was no significant fall in plasma
ang ii concentration. plasma anf increased but
this was not statistically significant.

discussion

the mechanism of action of ang ii as a modulator
of a-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses has
been intensively studied in recent years, with no
consensus emerging. theoretically, two or more
agents that affect the autonomic control of vaso-
motor tone can interact in several ways. one in-
volves the alteration of the kinetics of absorption,
metabolism, or excretion of one agent by another.

there is no evidence that this mechanism is oper-
ative with respect to ang ii and a-adrenoceptor ag-
onists and antagonists. another mechanism might
be the modulation, by a-adrenoceptor agents, of the
activation of the renin—angiotensin system; but al-
though the role of renal b-adrenoceptors in this re-
gard has been established, there is no indication that
a-adrenoceptors work in this way. most attention
has focused on interactions between ang ii and
ace inhibitors, on the one hand, and a-adrenocep-
tor agonists and antagonists, on the other, at the
level of the central autonomic outflow, the auto-
nomic nerve terminal, and the a-adrenoceptors of
vascular smooth muscle.

centrally administered ang ii causes a rise in ar-
terial blood pressure by activating the sympathetic
nervous system (5,6), with elevation of the plasma
epinephrine level (7). ang ii also acts on sympa-
thetic nerve terminals to facilitate ne release (8),
and on ang ii membrane-bound receptors to acti-
vate phospholipase c, probably via a membrane
guanosine nucleotide regulatory protein, thus shar-

ing a major excitation—contraction coupling path-
way with ne and a,-adrenergic receptors. for all
of these reasons, it could be predicted that ace
inhibition would, by reducing endogenous ang ii
concentrations at effector sites, result in upregula-
tion of a-adrenoceptor-dependent mechanisms and
sensitization to a;-adrenoceptor agonists.

the experimental support for this idea is meager.
reid et al. (3) showed that, in patients with essential
hypertension treated for 6 weeks with enalapril, 20
mg daily, the pressor responsiveness to infused pe
was increased. our study, reported here, showed
no such effect following 4 weeks of therapy with
 xxxd1694xxx , 2.5 or 5.0 mg daily. the reason for this
lack of effect is not known; it could be a too short
duration of therapy, a too low dose (a possibility
supported to some extent by the lack of any de-
crease in plasma ang ii concentration; however,
there was a reactive hyperreninemia), or a too ov-
ersimplified pathophysiological concept.

it should be mentioned that others have reported

sence of reflex bradycardia induced by ang il.

very different data, but in different animal prepa-
rations. grant and mcgrath (9), using the pithed rat,
found that the ace inhibitor teprotide attenuated
pressor responses to a - (and a2-) adrenoceptor ag-
onists, while tierney et al. (10) reported no effect
of enalaprilat on rat tail artery segment responses
to pe.

the ang ii responses (or rather lack of them) are
of great interest. we have shown no effect of cila-
 xxxd1694xxx  therapy on exogenous ang ii pressor re-
sponses in humans. this is in contrast to increased
responsiveness to ang ii in hypertensive patients
on enalapril (3), but consistent with findings in
pithed rats in which there was no effect of teprotide
pretreatment on pressor responses to ang ii (9).

most receptors upregulate in response to dener-
vation or to pharmacologic inhibition of agonist con-
centration. the lack of sensitization of ang ii pres-
sor receptors in our experiments may be due to the
same factors listed above in the context of pe sen-
sitivity. in addition, the increase in anf found in
our patients may, by inducing a negative sodium
balance, further enhance the hyperreninemia, suf-
ficient to antagonize the fall in ang ii induced by
the ace inhibitor. furthermore, anf, at least
when administered centrally to unanesthetized rats,
attenuates the central ang ii-induced pressor re-
sponse and plasma epinephrine elevation (7).

the apparent lack of ace inhibitor effects on pe
and ang ii pressor sensitivity in the present exper-
iments is in marked contrast to other modulators of
pressor effects in a similar population of patients.
for instance,  xxxd2737xxx , a dihydropyridine cal-
cium-channel blocker, significantly attenuates nor-
epinephrine and ang ii pressor responses, suggest-
ace inhibition and pressor sensitivity

ing that at least some of the vasopressor activity of
norepinephrine and ang ii is due to activation of
calcium channels (11). the clinical significance of
these findings may be that, because there seem to
be common pathways for a,-adrenergic and ca**-
mediated effects, the therapeutic combination of a -
adrenoceptor antagonists and ca?* channel block-
ers makes less sense than the combination of a-
adrenoceptor antagonists and ace inhibitors,
which seem to act independently of each other.
