(3), the initial spurt of dna synthesis occurs independent of
pituitary function (6). actual tumor induction, however, results
from action of unmetabolized estrogen directly upon the leydig
cells (7). these cells in both a susceptible and a nonsusceptible
strain of mouse contain an er3 complex. the cells from the

abstract
the interaction of 14 steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogen agonists and
antagonists with the intracellular  xxxg730xxx  system was examined
in cell suspensions prepared from the testes of mice that develop malig
nant leydig cell tumors after prolonged estrogen administration. the
ability of these substances to stimulate dna synthesis in short-term (3day) studies and to provoke leydig cell hyperplasia with prolonged (3mo) administration was also measured. our data were consistent with
the proposal that, in leydig cells, the carcinogenic effects of estrogens
are mediated through the intracellular receptor complex that results in a
localization of hormone bound to chromã¢tin and nuclear matrix.
all tested compounds displaced 170-[3h]estradiol from the cytosolic

two strains differ significantly in that nuclei from susceptible
animals bind more estrogen, and the proportion of the nuclear
er that remains fixed to the nuclear matrix in solutions of
high salt concentration is greater in the tumor-susceptible ani
mals (8). furthermore this fraction of the er increases in
amount per leydig cell as estrogen treatment of susceptible
mice continues over a 3-mo period and hyperplasia is initiated
(9).
the present study was undertaken to investigate the reaction
of a number of putative estrogen agonists and antagonists with
the er system in the leydig cells of the tumor-susceptible
balb/c strain. our specific objective was to correlate the
cytosolic er to nuclear acceptor interaction with the early
initiation of dna synthesis and with the subsequent develop
ment of leydig cell hyperplasia.

 xxxg730xxx , but to varying degrees; and there was no discernible
relationship between their ability to compete for this receptor and their
efficacy in stimulating dna synthesis. the effect of the test compounds
on the levels of  xxxg730xxx  in cytosol and in nuclei was measured
by |'ii|ostradio! exchange. 17/8-estradiol,  xxxd2018xxx , 17a- xxxd2054xxx ,
diethylstilbestrol, hexestrol,  xxxd1878xxx , coumestrol, and  xxxd2692xxx  pro
voked a complete  xxxg730xxx  response: acutely a decrease in the
level of cytosolic  xxxg730xxx  and an increase in the nuclear estrogen
receptor. all of these substances acutely stimulated dna synthesis.
tamoxifen, clomiphene, and nitromifene provoked a decrease in cytosolic
receptor but no increase in demonstrable nuclear  xxxg730xxx . 17aestradiol,  xxxd2581xxx , and estriol did not significantly alter the levels of
 xxxg730xxx  in cytosol or nuclei. only those substances that in
creased measurable nuclear  xxxg730xxx  also acutely stimulated
dna synthesis.
chronic (3-mo) treatment of 2-mo-oid male balb/c mice with dieth
ylstilbestrol, 17/3-estradiol,  xxxd2054xxx , and  xxxd2692xxx  led to leydig
cell hyperplasia. chronic  xxxd2581xxx  treatment also provoked leydig cell
hyperplasia; this is most probably due to induction of liver metabolism
of  xxxd2581xxx  to  xxxd2054xxx . chronic treatment with 17a-estradiol,
tamoxifen, and clomiphene failed to produce significant histologie al
changes in the testes. only chronic administration of those substances
that exhibited a complete  xxxg730xxx  response and acutely stimu
lated dna synthesis produced leydig cell hyperplasia.

introduction
malignant neoplasms arising from mature testicular leydig
cells can be induced readily in genetically susceptible mice by
chronically administering estrogenically active compounds,
either steroidal or nonsteroidal in chemical structure (1, 2).
twenty-four h after the initiation of treatment of such suscep
tible animals, but not of nonsusceptible ones, an increased
replicative synthesis of dna can be demonstrated in the leydig
cells (3-5). this new dna synthesis increases rapidly to peak
during the third day of treatment but is not associated with a
corresponding increase in mitotic activity. it then declines
significantly until several mo later when neoplasms form and
increases in both dna synthesis and mitotic activity become
evident. although a functional hypophysis is required for the
production of leydig cell hyperplasia and subsequent neoplasia

administration of test substances. in the experiments measuring the
effect on dna synthesis, estrogens and antiestrogens were administered
as 10-mg pellets of 10% test substance in cholesterol implanted s.c.

the two compounds were mixed and heated to 200â°c.coumestrol was

solved in 70% ethanol in 0.167 m nacl at a concentration of 2.5 mg/
ml and 100 m'(250 mg)were injected s.c.
preparation of cell suspensions. testis cell suspensions were pre
pared by a modification of the mechanical dispersion procedure de
scribed by schumacher et ai. (11). decapsulated testes, six to a flask,
were placed in 10 ml l-15 medium, ph 7.4, in 50-ml erlenmeyer flasks
and dispersed by gently drawing them into and expelling them 50 times
from a 5 x 400-mm teflon tube attached to a 50-ml syringe. the flasks
were then placed in a dubnoff metabolic shaking incubator (precision
scientific, chicago, il) at 24â°cfor 15 min with moderate agitation.
the flask contents were transferred to 16 x 125-mm falcon (becton,
dickinson and co., oxnard, ca) screw-capped plastic test tubes and
the tubes placed on an ames (miles laboratory inc., elkhart, in)
aliquot mixer for 1 min. after mixing, the tubes were placed upright in
crushed ice. after 30 sec the supernatant portions were transferred with
pasteur pipets of 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes through 62-/im
nylon mesh (small parts, inc., miami, fl). l-15 medium (5 ml) was
added to the tubes and the mixing-decanting repeated until 50 ml of
supernatant had been collected. the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at 4"c. the pelleted cells were suspended in
l-15 for thy inidino incorporation studies and in tem buffer for prep
aration of cytosolic and nuclear fractions.
preparation of cytosolic and nuclear fractions. cell suspensions were
homogenized in conical teflon-glass tissue grinders (kontes glass co.,
vineland, nj) at 0-4â°c.the homogenates were centrifugea at 800 x
g for 10 min at 4â°cin the type sw 50.1 rotor of a beckman l5-75b

tion of the tubes and quantification of the bound [3h]e2 were carried
out as described above.
binding to nuclear er. the binding of [3h]e2to nuclei was measured
by an adaptation of the exchange assay of anderson et al. (15) under
conditions that measure total available receptor sites. [3h]e2 (30 /il;
1.29 x io"8 m to 1.55 x io"7 m) was added to 1.5-ml eppendorf
centrifuge tubes, followed by nuclear suspension (125 /il; 0.2-0.3 mg
protein). nonspecific binding was measured in a series of replicates
containing  xxxd3426xxx -fold excess of unlabeled e2. the tubes were capped
and incubated at 37â°cfor l h with moderate agitation in a new
brunswick controlled environment incubator shaker (new brunswick
scientific co. inc., edison, nj), then cooled to 4â°c.the tubes were
centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4â°cand the supernatants removed
by aspiration. the pellets were washed twice by resuspending in 0.5 ml
tem buffer and centrifuging. the washed pellets were suspended in
0.5 ml of bts-450 and incubated at 45â°cfor 2 h with occasional
mixing. after cooling, duplicate 100-fil portions were taken for liquid
scintillation counting in 10 ml of the omnifluor cocktail.
cytosolic and nuclear er levels. in experiments measuring the
translocation of er from cytoplasm to nucleus, the cytosolic and
nuclear er were quantified by [3h]e2 exchange. eight-wk-old mice

supernatant from this step was collected without including the super
fici;il lipid layer. a low-molecular-weight inhibitor of estrogen binding
to cytosolic er was removed by sephadex g-50 chromatography as
described by sato et al. (12). the sephadex eluates were treated with
dextran-coated charcoal to remove any endogenous estrogens (13) and
used for studies measuring cytosolic er binding and exchange.
pellets from the first homogenate centrifugation were resuspended
in 2 ml 0.2% tween 80 and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4â°c.

 xxxd102xxx 30% 0.167 m nacl. control animals received vehicle only. at
selected time intervals the animals were killed and testis cell fractions
prepared as described above. total binding was measured by incubating
cytosols with 15 nm [3h]e2at 4â°cfor 18 h; nuclei were incubated with
15 nm [3h]e2 for 30 min at 30â°c.nonspecific binding was estimated
by similar incubations with the addition of 4.5 mme2. [3h]e2 bound to
cytosols or nuclei was quantified by the procedures previously described.
the amount of exchangeable er was calculated from the specific
binding knowing the specific activity of the labeled e2 and expressed as
fmol/mg protein. protein was measured by the method of lowry et al.
(16).
l'i l| tliymiiliiif incorporation in vitro. the procedure used here was
similar to that used by spruance et al. (5). one ml cell suspension in
l-15 was incubated in polyethylene scintillation vials with [methyi-3h]thymidine (10 /ici; .16 nmol) for 1 h at 37â°cin a dubnoff metabolic

the supernatants were discarded and the pellets washed twice by
resuspending in 2 ml tem buffer and centrifuging. the final pellets
were resuspended in 5.5 ml tem buffer and used as the nuclear fraction.
binding to cytosolic er. the binding of e2 to cytosolic er was
measured by a modification of the exchange assay described by katzenellenbogen et ai. (14). [3h]e2was dissolved in ethanol and then diluted
with tem buffer to the desired concentrations. [3h]e2 (30 /â»i;1.29 x
io"8 m to 1.55 x 10~7 m was added to 1.5-ml eppendorf centrifuge

shaking incubator. the reaction was stopped by adding an equal
volume of 8% formaldehyde and homogenizing the cells in a conical
teflon-glass tissue grinder. the homogenization and subsequent steps
were carried out at 4â°c.samples of the homogenate were diluted in
dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for protein analysis, and 2 por
tions of 50 n\ were digested with bts-450 and counted to determine
the total radioactivity in each incubation. the remaining homogenates
were transferred to graduated conical centrifuge tubes, and the acidinsoluble material was precipitated by the addition of 3 times their
volume of 0.5 m perchloric acid. the precipitates were fractionated
into rna, dna, and protein, and the radioactivity in each fraction
was quantified by the procedure described and validated in an earlier
publication (17) modified slightly to accommodate the present tissues.

dilutions with dimethylformamide and tem buffer to the desired
concentrations. the tubes were capped and placed in a 4â°ccold room
for 2 h. all subsequent operations were carried out in the cold room.
cytosol (125 /â»i;
0.125-0.15 mg protein) was added to each of the tubes
which were then capped and incubated for 18 h with continuous
agitation in an eberbach shaker (eberbach instruments inc., ann
arbor, mi). hydroxylapatite (250 /il; 1 mg/ml in tem buffer) was
added to each tube. the tubes were incubated at 4â°cfor 15 min, with

cytosolic and nuclear er. the presence of er in leydig cell
cytosolic and nuclear fractions as previously reported (8,9) was
confirmed in our preparations and characterized by carrying
out the estrogen-binding assay with concentrations of [3h]e2

vortexing every 3 min, and centrifuged at 8800 x g for 5 min. the
supernatants were removed by aspiration and the pellets washed 3 times
by resuspending in 1 ml tem and centrifuging. the washed hydroxylapatite pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml ethanol and the tubes
incubated at 45â°cfor 2 h with occasional vortexing. the tubes were
cooled to 4â°cand centrifuged. duplicate 100-fil portions of the super
natants were transferred to 7-nil glass scintillation vials, 7 ml betaphase
were added to each, and the samples were counted in a beckman ls7500 liquid scintillation counter (beckman instruments, fullerton,
ca).
the ability of several putative estrogen agonists and antagonists to
complete with [3h]e2 for binding to cytosols was also measured. the
test substances were dissolved in ethanol or dimethylformamide and
carried through serial dilutions with ethanol, dimethylformamide, and

ranging from 2.5 to 30 nm. both fractions exhibited saturable,
specific binding. the kas were estimated from double-reciprocal
plots. the cytosolic receptor had a ka of 6.5 x 10~8m, and the
nuclear receptor had a kt of 1.25 x 10~8 m.
competition of test substances for cytosolic er. most of the
substances studied were not readily available in radiolabeled
form. under the proper experimental conditions, that is, if the
concentrations of unlabeled ligand and of binding sites are
much lower than the ka, the concentration of unlabeled sub15

stance that will displace 50% of the radiolabeled estradici from
the er (the k\â€ž)provides an estimate of the ability of that
substance to compete with estradici for the er (18).
to test the validity of this method the displacement of
radiolabeled e2 (1 x 10~9 m) from cytosolic er by non labeled
e2 was measured. the ic50 for e2 was 8.75 x 10~" m. since
this was very close to the kafrom the double-reciprocal plot of
the saturation curve, we concluded that displacement of [3h]e2
would provide a valid estimate of relative affinity of the test
substances for the cytosolic er in this system. competition
curves for des, e2, and ee are shown in fig. 1.
the ability of a number of steroidal and nonsteroidal estro
gens and of antiestrogens to complete for the cytosolic er was
measured, and the results are shown in table 1.

the time course of the change in er levels in the nuclear
fractions for the same substances is shown in fig. 3. the
maximum change in er in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions
for all of the compounds tested are summarized in table 2.
stimulation of dna synthesis. the next set of experiments
tested the ability of these compounds administered in vivo to
stimulate dna synthesis. this was done by quantifying [3h]thymidine incorporation in vitro into the dna of testis cell
suspensions obtained 3 days after initiation of treatment. four
groups of animals were used in each experiment: a control
group that received cholesterol pellets, a "positive control"
group that received 10% des 90% cholesterol pellets: and two
groups that received 10% "test" substance: 90% cholesterol
pellets. differential cell counts revealed that suspensions pre

values calculated for the test compounds were not spuriously
high.
effects of chronic administration. to correlate the early dna
synthesis spurt with the development of leydig cell hyperplasia,
2-iiki old animals were implanted with a single 5-mg fused
pellet containing 20% ee or e2. at necropsy 3 mo later, the
testes of ee-implanted animals showed as extensive leydig cell
hyperplasia as if they had received a des-containing pellet (9).
however, the interstitial tissues of these mice did contain more
lipid-filled macrophages than is usual with des treatment. the
testes of animals receiving an e2 pellet also had distinct areas
of leydig cell hyperplasia, but these hyperplastic changes were
not as extensive or evenly distributed throughout the gland as
with ee or des treatment.
since  xxxd2581xxx  is an effective estrogen but requires demethylation of the methoxy radical at c3 for activation (19, 20),
male mice were implanted with one or two 5-mg pellets of 20%
 xxxd2581xxx  fused with cholesterol. ten to 14 days later the mean
weight of the sv-cgc was reduced by more than 50%, indic
ative of effective estrogenization. also, the level of 3h-e2exchangeable er in nuclear fractions prepared from testis cell
suspensions from these animals had increased to a level com
parable to that found in preparations from animals bearing ee
or des pellets for the same time period (data not shown).
unlike animals implanted with ee or des, the suppression of
sv-cgc weight had diminished significantly after 6 wk of
implantation suggesting a more rapid extraction of the steroid
from the pellet. to test for production of leydig cell hyperplasia
animals were, therefore, implanted with five 5-mg pellets. three
mo later their sv-cgc were found to be greatly suppressed,
and there was extensive preneoplastic hyperplasia of the testicular leydig cells similar to that seen in animals treated with
ee.

compounds to be tested, mice were implanted with 5 fused 5mg pellets containing 20% of the various test substances, and
the effects of tamoxifen,  xxxd2692xxx , clomiphene, and 17aestradiol were examined. after 3 mo of treatment, areas of
leydig cell hyperplasia were evident in animals that had re
ceived  xxxd2692xxx -containing pellets. significant histologie al
terations could not be discerned in the testes of animals bearing
pellets containing any of the other test substances.
discussion
the evidence presented here is consistent with the proposal
that estrogens act in mouse leydig cell carcinogenesis through
an  xxxg730xxx  mechanism to stimulate [3h]thymidine
incorporation into dna during short-term administration and
to provoke preneoplastic hyperplasia after longer periods of
treatment.
each of the several estrogen agonists and antagonists studied
was able to compete with e2 for the cytosolic er, but there was
no correlation between the relative ability of a substance to do
so (the ic50) and its ability to acutely stimulate [3h]thymidine

ing rapid dna synthesis. this resulted in a variable baseline
for comparing [3h]thymidine incorporation experiment to ex
periment when the values obtained from the "control" prepa
rations were used directly. to reduce this variability, the results
shown in table 3 are presented as the ['hjthymidine incorpo
ration following treatment with each "test" compound as a
percentage of that found in the preparation from des-treated
animals in the same experiment, i.e., as a percentage of the
"positive" control. additionally, only the results of those ex
periments (81 of 90) in which the incorporation of [3h]thymi-

and hexestrol were the two most potent stimulators of [3h]thymidine incorporation, while their ic5os differed by a factor
of 35. on the other hand ee was a potent stimulator of [3h]thymidine incorporation while 17a-estradiol was inactive in
this regard, and their ic50s were quite similar.

er in leydig

cell

when the same series of compounds was tested for their
effect on the levels of exchangeable cytosolic and nuclear er,
only those substances that acutely provoked a complete estro
gen receptor response, that is, both a decrease in the cytosolic
er and an increase in the nuclear er, also stimulated | 'i i|-

preneoplasia

mice (7). the present studies support the proposal that biolog
ically active estrogens effect malignant transformation of leydig cells through the intracellular receptor mechanism that
results in binding of the active compound to chromatin and to
the nuclear matrix (8, 9). within 3 days, this results in a surge
of replicative dna synthesis and, upon chronic exposure, pro
vokes a hyperplastic overgrowth of leydig cells eventually
giving rise to the evolution of malignant neoplasms.

thymidine incorporation into dna (tables 2 and 3). in the
case of the steroids, administration of e2,  xxxd2018xxx , and ee was
followed by a marked increase in nuclear er and [3h]thymidine
incorporation, while  xxxd2581xxx , 17a-estradiol, and estriol pro
voked only a slight increase in nuclear er and actually de
pressed [3h]thymidine incorporation below the control. the

stilbene derivatives diethylstilbestrol, hexestrol, and  xxxd1878xxx 
were all highly potent in stimulating increases in both nuclear
er and [3h|thymidine incorporation. the triphenylethylene

antiestrogens tamoxifen, clomiphene, and nitromifene de
pressed the cytosolic er but failed to elevate exchangeable
nuclear er or stimulate [3h]thymidine incorporation. the only
putative antiestrogen which provoked a complete estrogen re
ceptor response was the diphenyldihydronaphthalene derivative
 xxxd2692xxx , and it stimulated [3h]thymidine incorporation
acutely.
the data presented here provide no explanation for the failure
of the triphenylethylene estrogen antagonists to provoke an
increase in the exchangeable nuclear er even though they
depressed the cytosolic er. one possibility is that when these
substances bind to the receptor they induce a conformation
such that the [3h]e2 does not readily exchange with the bound
ligand and thus some of the receptor would not be detected by
this methodology, whether it is located in the cytosol or the
nucleus. in this regard, tamoxifen, which has to be monohydroxylated to be biologically effective, was the only compound
that decreased the level of exchangeable nuclear er. rat uterine
nuclear er labeled with [3h]4- xxxd91xxx  is much more
resistant to proteolytic digestion than er labeled with [3h]estradiol or [3h] xxxd1880xxx  (21). this suggests a differ
ent conformation of the nuclear er when it is bound to the 4hydroxytamoxifen than when it is bound to its natural steroid
ligand or to the estrogen agonist des.
when 2-mo-old male balb/c mice were subjected to chronic
(3-mo) treatment with several of these substances, leydig cell
hyperplasia occurred in animals treated with des, e2, ee, and
 xxxd2692xxx , all substances which provoked a complete estrogen
receptor response and acutely stimulated [3h]thymidine incor
poration. 17a-estradiol, tamoxifen, and clomiphene failed to
produce any significant histologie changes in the testes; these
are substances which neither increased the nuclear er nor
stimulated [3h]thymidine incorporation.
the compound that did not fit this pattern was  xxxd2581xxx ,
which was inactive in provoking the short-term responses but
when given continuously for 3 mo did lead to extensive leydig
cell hyperplasia. the estrogenic activity of  xxxd2581xxx  in humans
is attributed to the fact that it is demethylated to ee (19, 20),
a reaction which also occurs in rat liver microsomes (22). the
demethylase activity of these microsomes is inducible, since it
is increased by pretreatment of the animals with phã©nobarbital.
it may be that our mice lacked sufficient demethylase activity
to convert  xxxd2581xxx  to the active product during the first days
of administration but that the enzyme system was induced by
longer (10- to 14-day) treatment with  xxxd2581xxx , thus providing
the animals with physiologically active levels of ee.
a previous study demonstrated that the carcinogenic effects
of e2 on leydig cells resulted from actions of the unmetabolized
steroid directly on testicular tissues of genetically susceptible
