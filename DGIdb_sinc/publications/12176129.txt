1. introduction
malaria is arguably the most important transmitted
parasitic disease in humans and is endemic in over 100
countries. on an average, more than 100 million patients
contract malaria each year [1] and estimates of malariarelated mortality vary from 1.5 to 2.7 million people
worldwide annually [2]. despite therapeutic progress, the
drug armamentarium used to treat malaria is limited.
 xxxd2258xxx  is a widely used phenanthrene-methanol
class antimalarial drug that is widely prescribed in developing countries for the treatment of uncomplicated

chloroquine-resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria. it is
also prescribed for travelers to malaria endemic areas to
treat failed chemoprophylaxis [3–5]. orally administered
as a racemic mixture,  xxxd2258xxx  undergoes n-debutylation in the liver by  xxxg590xxx  (cyp 3a4) to
its major metabolite n-desbutylhalofantrine. this metabolite is found in serum soon after administration of  xxxd2258xxx  usually in lower concentrations [6,7]. both compounds are thought to contribute to the antimalarial activity
of the parent drug.
 xxxd2258xxx  is associated with lengthening of the qt
interval in patients without known cardiac abnormalities
[1,8–10]. the drug has been associated with palpitations,
syncope, and fatal or near fatal arrhythmias [7,11,12]. this
resulted in prescribing information for  xxxd2258xxx  that
time for primary review 15 days.

objective: the antimalarial drug  xxxd2258xxx  has been associated with qt interval prolongation and with fatal and nonfatal
arrhythmias in patients without known underlying cardiac abnormalities. a common target for qt interval-prolonging drugs is the human
ether-a-go-go gene (herg) which encodes the pore forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier k 1 current (ikr ). methods:
we studied the effects of  xxxd2258xxx  (0.1–1000 nm) and its major metabolite n-desbutylhalofantrine (3–1000 nm) on wild type herg
k 1 channels stably expressed in hek 293 cells, using the whole cell patch-clamp recording technique. results:  xxxd2258xxx  and
n-desbutylhalofantrine blocked herg k 1 channels in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of
21.6 nm (n531 cells) and 71.7 nm (n518 cells), respectively. the development of drug block for both  xxxd2258xxx  and ndesbutylhalofantrine required channel activation indicative of open and / or inactivated state block. drug washout or cell hyperpolarization
resulted in minimal current recovery consistent with virtually irreversible binding. using a ventricular action potential voltage clamp
protocol,  xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine block of herg current was greatest during phases 2 and 3 of the action potential
waveform. conclusion: we conclude that both  xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine cause high affinity block of herg k 1 channels.
although n-desbutylhalofantrine has been suggested to be a safer antimalarial agent compared to  xxxd2258xxx , our results suggest that the
gain in the safety margin for qt interval prolongation-related cardiotoxicity is minimal.

recommends its use only in persons who have a normal
electrocardiogram, which makes its use in many less
developed countries not practical [5,13]. animal studies
have confirmed that  xxxd2258xxx  prolongs the rate-corrected qt (qtc) interval in a concentration-dependent
manner [14]. little is known about the electrophysiological
effects of n-desbutylhalofantrine.
cardiac delayed rectifier k 1 current is composed of two
distinct components, the rapidly (ikr ) and slowly (iks )
activating currents [15]. the ikr channel pore-forming
protein is encoded by the human ether-a go-go related
gene (herg) [15–17]. suppression of ikr causes action
potential and qt interval prolongation leading to the
generation of early afterdepolarizations and ventricular
arrhythmias [18]. herg channels have unique pharmacological properties and are blocked by many classes of
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular drugs that cause
drug-induced long qt syndrome (for discussion, see refs.
[18–20]). in the present report, we examined the effects of
 xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine on herg channels heterologously expressed in a human cell line to
compare their respective herg block properties. a preliminary report of this work has appeared [21].

2.1. dna constructs and stable transfection of hek 293
cells
the stable transfection and culture of human embryonic
kidney (hek) 293 cells with herg cdna has been
previously described [22–24]. the cells were harvested
from the culture dish by trypsinization, washed twice with
standard mem, and stored in this medium at room
temperature for electrophysiological study on the same
day.

2.2. patch clamp recording method
membrane currents were recorded in the whole-cell
patch clamp configuration [22–24] using an axopatch
200b amplifier. patch electrodes typically had resistances
of 3–5 mv when filled with internal pipette solution.
capacitance compensation was used in all experiments.
computer software (pclamp 6.02 or 8, axon instruments) was used to generate voltage clamp protocols,
acquire data, and analyze current signals. cells were
superfused with tyrode solution containing (in mm) 137.0
nacl, 4.0 kcl, 1.8  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 1.0 mgcl 2 , 10.0 glucose, and
10.0 hepes / naoh, with a ph of 7.4. the internal pipette
solution contained (in mm) 130.0 kcl, 1.0 mgcl 2 , 5.0
egta, 5.0 mgatp, 10.0 hepes / koh, with a ph of 7.2.
solution exchanges in the cell bath were completed within
1 min. experiments were performed at 2361 8c except for

2.3. drugs and chemicals
 xxxd2258xxx  (halafan  ) and n-desbutylhalofantrine
were kindly provided by smithkline beecham, uk. the
drugs were dissolved in 100% ethanol to make 10 mm
stock solutions. fresh drug aliquots were prepared on the
day of the experiments by diluting stock solution with
tyrode solution. ethanol, at a concentration of 0.01%,
equivalent to the highest drug dilution studied had no
effect on herg current (data not shown).

2.4. curve fitting and statistical methods
data are given as a mean6standard error of the mean.
concentration-dependent effects were fit to the hill equation (idrug /icontrol 5 1 / [1 1 (d/ ic 50 )n h ]), where d is the
drug concentration, ic 50 is the drug concentration for 50%
of maximal block, and n h is the hill coefficient. statistical
significance was analyzed using a student t-test. a p value
,0.05 was considered statistically significant.

fig. 1 shows the effect of  xxxd2258xxx  (left panels) and
n-desbutylhalofantrine (right panels) on herg k 1 current. the voltage protocol is shown in the upper traces in
fig. 1a and c. depolarizing steps were applied from a
holding potential of 280 mv to between 270 and 60 mv
for 4 s, followed by a step to 250 mv for 5.7 s to elicit
tail current. this pulse protocol was applied at 15-s
intervals. representative herg current traces for control
conditions and following drug exposure (30 nm  xxxd2258xxx  and 300 nm n-desbutylhalofantrine) to produce
steady-state block are shown beneath the voltage protocols.
both drugs reduced herg current amplitude. fig. 1b and
d shows averaged current–voltage relations obtained for
herg current measured at the end of the depolarizing step
(istep ) and for peak tail current amplitude (itail ) measured
following the step to 250 mv. for control conditions,
herg current activated at voltages positive to 250 to
240 mv, maximum current was reached for steps to |10
mv, and at more positive voltages inward rectification was
present because of voltage-dependent rapid inactivation
[25,26]. the peak tail current was maximal after voltage
steps positive to 20 mv. the current–voltage plots after
drug exposure show that 30 nm  xxxd2258xxx  (n54 cells)
and 300 nm n-desbutylhalofantrine (n54 cells) suppressed herg current.

used an initial depolarizing step to 20 mv for 4 s followed
by a step to 250 mv for 5.7 s to elicit tail current, with the

intervals. with application of the first depolarizing step to
20 mv, herg current amplitude initially was only minimally reduced for both  xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine, but decreased further during the step as
additional block developed. block of herg current during
the voltage clamp protocol reached a steady-state by the
application of the fourth pulse in the sequence. these
findings demonstrate that the development of high-affinity
drug block required the activation of herg channels from
the closed state. using this protocol to obtain steady-state
block,  xxxd2258xxx  was studied at 0.1, 0.3, 3, 10, 30, 100,
300 and 1000 nm concentrations with each cell (n531)
exposed to only one drug concentration. n-desbutylhalofantrine was studied at 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 and
1000 nm concentrations with each cell (n518) also
exposed to only one drug concentration. for  xxxd2258xxx ,
the ic 50 value for steady-state peak tail current block was
21.663.6 nm with a hill coefficient of 0.62, and for
n-desbutylhalofantrine the ic 50 value was slightly higher
at 71.767.3 nm with a hill coefficient of 1.36.

recovery from drug block of herg channels is highly
variable. for drugs such as methanesulfonanilide antiarrhythmic compounds (e.g. e-4031, mk-499 and dofetilide)
unbinding occurs very slowly so that drug block is
essentially irreversible. this has been attributed to trapping
of charged drug moiety within the inner vestibule of the
pore [19,20]. in contrast, other drugs (e.g. verapamil,
cocaine) have been shown to rapidly unblock following
membrane repolarization possibly due to equilibrium diffu-

sion of the uncharged drug moiety [24] or to the direct
escape of charged drug moiety via the open channel [27].
to assess voltage-dependent unbinding of  xxxd2258xxx  and
n-desbutylhalofantrine, a two-pulse protocol was used.
the voltage clamp protocol is shown in fig. 3a. from a
holding potential of 280 mv, a 100-ms-long step to 60 mv
was applied to rapidly activate herg current followed by
a 10-s-long step to 0 mv to obtain a steady level of drug
block. the cell membrane was repolarized to 280 mv for
a variable period of time before a test pulse sequence to 60
mv for 100 ms and then to 0 mv for 200 ms was applied
to assess the amount of herg current that could be
elicited following repolarization.  xxxd2258xxx  (100 nm) or
n-desbutylhalofantrine (300 nm), drug concentrations that
cause similar levels of block, was continuously perfused in
the chamber while the two-pulse protocol was applied at
60-s intervals. fig. 3b ( xxxd2258xxx ) and 3c (n-desbutylhalofantrine) show example herg current records.
 xxxd2258xxx  or n-desbutylhalofantrine was added to the
chamber while each cell was held at 280 mv. the first
depolarizing pulse sequence (1st step) resulted in a large
amplitude herg current that decreased during the 10-slong step as drug block developed, and steady-state block
was reached by the second application of the two-pulse
protocol. recovery intervals of up to 50 s resulted in
virtually no increase in herg current amplitude consistent
with nearly irreversible drug binding to herg channels by
both  xxxd2258xxx  (n53 cells) and n-desbutylhalofantrine
(n54 cells). in other experiments, washout for 5 min of
100 nm  xxxd2258xxx  (n55 cells) or 300 nm n-desbutylhalofantrine (n53 cells) did not result in recovery of
herg current (data not shown), consistent with essentially
irreversible drug binding.

3.3. cardiac action potential clamp
to examine the effects of  xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine on herg current, a ventricular action
potential clamp method was used as shown in fig. 4a. at
positive voltages reached during action potential depolarization, herg channels rapidly inactivate, causing the
control herg current amplitude to initially be small.
during action potential repolarization, herg channels
recover from inactivation to rapidly reopen and then to
more slowly deactivate, which increases their occupancy in
the open state and the amplitude of herg current. with
terminal repolarization herg current then deactivates.
this is shown in the control records in fig. 4b and c
where herg current reaches its maximum during phases 2
and 3 of the action potential clamp waveform.  xxxd2258xxx 
(100 nm, fig. 4b) or n-desbutylhalofantrine (1 mm, fig.
4c) was then superfused for 10 min and the action
potential clamp protocol was applied at 5-s intervals to
obtain a steady-state of drug block. herg current was
suppressed throughout the action potential clamp waveform with the reduction most evident during phases 2 and
3. similar findings were obtained in three cells with each

803

drug. for each cell, the peak outward herg current
amplitude during phases 2 and 3 of the action potential
clamp waveform was measured for the control current and
this value was compared to the current remaining at the
same time point following drug exposure. for 100 nm
 xxxd2258xxx , herg current amplitude was reduced by
71.463.6% (p,0.05), and for 1 mm n-desbutylhalofantrine herg current amplitude was reduced by 94.761.5%
(p,0.05). these reductions of herg current amplitude
are nearly identical to the reductions of herg current
amplitude obtained using conventional voltage clamp
square pulse protocols (see fig. 2a and b). the reduction
in herg current provides a mechanism for action potential prolongation.

 xxxd2258xxx -induced prolongation of the qt and qtc
intervals on an electrocardiogram was initially reported in
patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria receiving

are among the more potent herg channel blocking drugs
reported, and suggest that drug screening in heterologous
expression systems may have clinical utility. block of
herg current, or ikr in native heart cells, is well known to
cause drug-induced long qt syndrome. this occurs with
several antiarrhythmic drugs, as well as with many other
classes of drugs including macrolide antibiotics [33],
fluoroquinolone antibiotics [34,35], antipsychotics [36],
antihistamines [37,38], and gastrointestinal prokinetic
agents [22].
the role of drug metabolites in drug-induced long qt
syndrome is both complex and important. a role for drug
metabolites in cardiotoxicity is being increasingly recognized by the pharmaceutical industry [39]. for some drugs
such as  xxxd236xxx , its principal metabolite (desmethylastemizole) is known to cause block of herg channels
that is equipotent to the parent compound, and under some
conditions it is the metabolite that has been postulated to
be the principal cause of drug-induced long qt syndrome
[38]. for  xxxd236xxx , it is known to have additional
metabolites (norastemizole or tecastemizole) that also exert
herg channel block [38]. for other drugs such as
terfenadine, its principal metabolite (terfenadine carboxylate or fexofenadine) exerts only very weak block of
herg channels, and it has become a clinically important
antihistamine drug thought not to cause long qt syndrome
[40]. n-desbutylhalofantrine has been suggested to be a
potentially safer antimalarial drug compared to its parent
compound [31]. our results do not provide a conclusive
answer to this question. however, the finding that the ic 50
values for herg channel block are similar suggests that
improvement in the safety margin for qt interval prolongation-related cardiotoxicity is likely to be minimal.

dose)  xxxd2258xxx  caused dose-dependent lengthening of
qtc intervals in 61 patients with multidrug-resistant
falciparum malaria [6]. these investigators suggested that
qt interval prolongation was associated with the parent
drug  xxxd2258xxx , but not its major metabolite n-desbutylhalofantrine [29]. subsequent studies have yielded
conflicting results. matson et al. reported that  xxxd2258xxx 
and n-desbutylhalofantrine both could cause qt interval
lengthening [30]. in a different study the sum of the
 xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine serum concentrations correlated with qt interval lengthening, although the
relative effects were not determined [8]. in a brief report
correlating serum drug levels and adverse cardiac events,
gundersen et al. reported  xxxd2258xxx -associated ventricular fibrillation in a patient without predisposing qtc
prolongation [7]. they found that the serum level for
n-desbutylhalofantrine (324 mg / l) exceeded the serum
level for  xxxd2258xxx  (53 mg / l) and suggested a key role
for the metabolite in the cardiotoxicity of  xxxd2258xxx .
limited data exist that directly compare  xxxd2258xxx  and
n-desbutylhalofantrine. in feline ventricular myocytes and
perfused hearts, wesche et al. showed that  xxxd2258xxx  was
slightly more potent at suppressing ikr and prolonging the
qt interval than was n-desbutylhalofantrine [31].
our findings provide evidence that closed state block by
 xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine is minimal, rather,
our findings suggest that both drugs block preferentially
the activated (e.g. open and / or inactivated) states of
herg channels. the experiments, however, do not distinguish between open or inactivated state block. this
agrees with many previous reports of other drugs that
block herg channels in a similar manner, and with
previous findings with  xxxd2258xxx  by tie et al. [32]. our
results also suggest that both  xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine bind to herg channels to cause essentially irreversible block. the mechanism of irreversible
block has been suggested to involve drug binding within
the inner vestibule of the pore region to aromatic amino
acid residues of the herg protein [19,20].
the present work is the first report comparing these
drugs on a cloned human ion channel. our work provides
new information about potential cardiac toxicity of the
anti-malarial drug  xxxd2258xxx . the principal finding is
that both  xxxd2258xxx  and its metabolite, n-desbutylhalofantrine, cause high affinity block of herg k 1
channels. the ic 50 values, while not identical (21.6 and
71.7 nm, respectively, p,0.05) suggest that these drugs
block herg channels with relatively similar affinities.
the value we found for  xxxd2258xxx -induced block of
herg channels is close to the ic 50 value (196.9 nm)
recently reported for herg channels expressed in cho
cells [32], however, these investigators did not study ndesbutylhalofantrine. the metabolite, in part because of its
slower elimination kinetics, can achieve higher steady-state
plasma concentrations than the parent compound [7]. our
data indicate that  xxxd2258xxx  and n-desbutylhalofantrine
