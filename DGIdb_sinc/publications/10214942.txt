abstract transcriptional activation of pparqq by the antidiabetic compound troglitazone enhances the rate of 3t3-l1
adipocyte differentiation. in this study, we examined the effects
of troglitazone, a specific pparqq ligand, on the expression of
pparqq during and after 3t3-l1 adipocyte differentiation.
troglitazone treatment caused a significant decrease in pparqq
proteins and dna binding activity. this reduction was
associated with a similar decrease in transcription of pparqq
mrna. these data suggest that in 3t3-l1 cells, the expression
of pparqq is auto-regulated.

pparq and pparn occurs very rapidly during adipocyte differentiation. third, the ectopic expression of either pparq or
ppark can induce fat cell di¡erentiation in the presence of
ppar activators in nih 3t3 cells [14,15].
therefore, the ability of thiazolidinediones to decrease plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients [16] may result from pparq dependent regulation of gene transcription. because the
biologic e¡ect of ppar ligands must depend on the cellular
concentration of its functional receptors, we sought to examine the regulation of pparq by troglitazone in the 3t3-l1
adipocyte system. we show that pparq undergoes ligand
dependent down-regulation in 3t3-l1 adipocytes.
2. materials and methods

1. introduction

2.1. materials
dex,  xxxd2388xxx  and insulin were purchased from sigma. 2-bromopalmitate was obtained from aldrich. troglitazone was synthesized at
parke-davis pharmaceutical research, division of warner-lambert
co. fetal bovine serum (fbs) was purchased from summit biotechnology. dulbecco's modi¢ed eagle's medium (dmem) was from
gibco bethesda research laboratories (brl).

treatment of con£uent 3t3-l1 preadipocytes with fetal bovine serum (fbs), insulin, dexamethasone (dex) and  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) induces the di¡erentiation of 3t3l1 cells into adipocytes within 7 to 8 days [1]. acquisition of
the adipocyte phenotype requires the coordinate expression of
speci¢c transcription factors, and the subsequent induction of
adipocyte-enriched genes including ap2 (intracellular lipid
binding protein), glucose transporter 4 (glut4) and stearoylcoa desaturase 1 ( xxxg2014xxx ) [2,3]. initial work showed that expression of the ccaat enhancer binding protein alpha (c/
ebpk) was necessary and su¤cient for expression of the adipocyte phenotype [4]. however, the late expression of c/ebpk
during di¡erentiation led researchers to discover an adipocyteenriched new transcription factor, pparq.
in mouse, several ppar subtypes, ppark, pparq and
pparn ( xxxg1806xxx / xxxg1806xxx ), have been identi¢ed [5^7]. pparq
is expressed predominantly in mouse white and brown fat,
with lower levels in liver, whereas ppark is present in heart,
kidney and liver [7,8]. pparn expression is ubiquitous [6,9].
heterodimerization with a second steroid receptor family
member, the retinoic x receptor (rxr), is required for
dna binding of ppar to its direct repeat dna consensus
site, the ppre. transcriptional activity is established by the
binding of the isoform speci¢c ligands to the c-terminal ligand binding domain of the ppar [10,11].
several pieces of evidence establish ppars as important
regulators of fat cell di¡erentiation. first, in several preadipocyte cell lines, ppar activators such as 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (etya) or thiazolidinediones enhance adipocyte conversion [8,12,13,21]. second, the induction of

2.4. antibody preparation and immunodetection procedures
a full-length pparq protein was expressed in e. coli as a fusion
protein linked to a maltose binding protein using the pmal-c2 cloning vector (new england biolabs). the rabbit polyclonal antibody
was prepared using this fusion protein. standard western blotting
and immunoprecipitation protocols were used to identify or immunodeplete pparq from nuclear extracts [19]. the western blot was
quantitated with the bioimage system (imaging systems, millipore
corp.).

2.2. cell culture
3t3-l1 preadipocytes were cultured and induced to di¡erentiate as
reported previously [1]. brie£y, 2 days post-con£uent preadipocytes
were treated with 0.25 wm dex, 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx  and 1 wg/ml insulin
for 2 days. cells were then switched to 10% fbs/dmem media containing only insulin (1 wg/ml) for 2 days, and ¢nally to 10% fbs/
dmem. for ppar activator treatment, a ¢nal concentration of 5 wm
troglitazone in dmso, or 30 wm 2-bromopalmitate in ethanol, was
added to the media. for the di¡erentiation experiments, the compounds were added to the media at the initiation of di¡erentiation
and replenished with every media change.
2.3. preparation of nuclear extracts
nuclei were isolated from 3t3-l1 cells as published previously [17].
brie£y, cells were rinsed twice with pbs and incubated with 50 mm
edta for 10 min to allow cells to detach from the plates. cells were
pelleted at 3000 rpm for 10 min, incubated in hypotonic bu¡er for
5 min, and homogenized using a dounce homogenizer ¢tted with a
tight pestle. nuclear extracts were prepared as published previously
[18]. protein concentrations were determined using the bca protein
reagent (pierce chemical co.).

3p) of the ap2 enhancer region or a double stranded nfub oligonucleotide (5p gatccgaggggactttccgctggggactttccagg 3p) (oncogene science) was end-labeled using [q-32 p]atp.
the labeled probe was then gel puri¢ed to remove single stranded
products. approximately 20 fmoles of the labeled probe were incubated with 5 wg of nuclear extracts in 1umobility shift assay bu¡er
(15 mm hepes ph 7.9, 80 mm kcl, 10% glycerol, 1 wg poly di/dc,
0.2 mm edta and 0.4 mm dtt) at room temperature for 20 min.
protein-dna complexes were analyzed in 5% 1utbe polyacrylamide
gels.
2.6. northern blot analysis
total rna was isolated from 3t3-l1 cells treated with the appropriate ligands in the presence or absence of  xxxd1800xxx  (5 wg/ml)
using the ultraspec rna isolation system (biotecx). approximately
10^15 wg of total rna was resolved on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde
gels and transferred to hybond-nylon membranes (amersham corp.)
in 10ussc. northern blots were prehybridized in a solution consisting of 10% peg, 1.5usspe, 7% sds, and 100 wg/ml of sonicated
salmon sperm dna at 65³c for 1 h. the pparn (a gift from p.a.
grimaldi, centre de biochimie, france), mouse c/ebpk (a gift from
p.f. johnson, frederick cancer research and development center,
frederick, md, usa), mouse ap2 (a gift from c. burrant, university
of chicago) and rat l-actin (pcractf) (a gift from r. hart,
rutgers university, new brunswick, nj, usa) cdnas were labeled
with [k-32 p]dctp (3000 ci/mmol, amersham) using random primed
labeling (brl). denatured, labeled probe was then added and incubation continued at 65³c overnight. high stringency wash conditions
were employed by soaking ¢lters twice in 2ussc, 0.1% sds (w/v) at
room temperature for 30 min and twice in 0.1ussc/0.1% sds (w/v)
at 65³c for 60 min. filters were removed and subjected to autoradiography at 370³c, or exposed to a phosphorimager screen (molecular dynamics) for quantitation.
2.7. rnase protection assay (rpa)
a set of primers (nucleotide positions 481^502 and 785^806) was
designed from the published pparq cdna sequences [20] and used to
amplify a 325 base pair (bp) pparq speci¢c fragment by polymerase
chain reaction (pcr). the pcr fragment was inserted into the pcrii
vector (invitrogen) and the nucleotide sequence was veri¢ed using
sequenase chemistry according to the manufacturer's recommendation (ubi). an antisense riboprobe was synthesized using sp6 rna
polymerase (brl). rpa was carried out following the instructions for
the rpa ii protocol (ambion). for normalization, a 340 bp mouse  xxxd2437xxx  riboprobe was synthesized from ptri-l-mouse dna template
(ambion) using sp6 rna polymerase and hybridized in the same
reactions with the pparq probe. the size of the protected pparq
and actin riboprobes was 300 and 250 base pairs, respectively.

3. results
3.1. e¡ects of troglitazone on pparq protein levels in
di¡erentiating 3t3-l1 cells
because ligands often auto-regulate the expression of their
own receptors, it was of interest to assess the e¡ects of troglitazone and other ppar activators on pparq protein levels
during 3t3-l1 cell di¡erentiation. fig. 1 shows the level of
pparq1 and pparq2 protein present in nuclear extracts at
various time points after the initiation of di¡erentiation with
or without troglitazone. in preadipocytes, both isoforms of
pparq proteins were detected at low levels. the expression
of both proteins increased dramatically within 2 days of di¡erentiation in control cells. this correlates well with the published reports on the early induction of pparq mrna during
3t3-l1 cell di¡erentiation [15]. however, within 2 days of
di¡erentiation, the presence of troglitazone caused a 72% decrease in pparq1 and a 50% decrease in pparq2 protein
levels relative to the control. the pparq protein levels continue to decline throughout the di¡erentiation in both treated
and the control cells. however, pparq protein levels remained lower in treated cells at all times.

fig. 1. the e¡ects of troglitazone on the expression of pparq1 and
g2 proteins. nuclear extracts were prepared from 3t3-l1 cells during di¡erentiation treated with either dmso or 5 wm troglitazone
in the presence of standard adipogenic inducers for the indicated
times. equal amounts of nuclear extract (30 wg of protein) as determined by bca protein reagent (pierce chemical co.) were subjected
to gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted using the anti-pparq
antibody. shown is a representative of two separate experiments.

3.2. e¡ects of troglitazone on the dna binding activity of
pparq
gel shift analysis was performed to determine if the troglitazone-induced changes in the pparq protein levels a¡ected
changes in pparq dna binding activity. nuclear extracts
isolated from di¡erentiating cells with or without troglitazone
were subjected to gel shift analysis. as the are7 ppre has
previously been shown to speci¢cally bind to pparq and
rxr heterodimer, a double stranded oligonucleotide containing the are7 ppre was used as a probe [14]. in control cell
extracts, the pparq dna binding activity reached maximal
levels after 3^4 days of di¡erentiation and decreased slightly
thereafter (fig. 2a). in comparison, nuclear extracts prepared
from cells treated with troglitazone showed a signi¢cant decrease in pparq dna binding activity (30^45%) (days 2^5).
addition of speci¢c or non-speci¢c competitor oligonucleotides indicated that the binding to are7 was speci¢c. moreover, to verify that the protein complexes formed in are7
ppre contain pparq, immunodepletion experiments were
performed using the anti-pparq antibody (fig. 2c). 3t3-l1
adipocyte extracts were immunoprecipitated with no antibody, pre-immune sera or anti-pparq antibody prior to gel
shift analysis. immunoprecipitation of the nuclear extract with
the anti-pparq antibody speci¢cally prevented retardation of
the ppre in the mobility shift assay, indicating the presence
of pparq in the shifted complex (fig. 2a and c).
to show that the troglitazone dependent decrease was speci¢c for ppars, an identical amount of nuclear extract was
used to shift a double stranded 32 p-labeled nfub oligonucleotide. no signi¢cant change in the binding activity of nfub
was found in troglitazone treated cells compared to that in
untreated control cells (fig. 2b). these results demonstrate
that troglitazone speci¢cally decreases the amount of pparq
dna binding activity without generally a¡ecting the levels of
other transcription factors.
3.3. troglitazone decreases pparq steady state mrna levels
in di¡erentiating 3t3-l1 cells

occurs at the level of transcription, the e¡ect of troglitazone

fig. 2. dna binding activity of pparq in troglitazone treated di¡erentiating 3t3-l1 cells. gel shift assay was performed using approximately
20 fmoles of the 32 p-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the pparq binding site (are7) (a) or a double stranded 32 p-labeled nfub oligonucleotide (b), and 5 wg of nuclear extracts prepared as described in the legend of fig. 1. to demonstrate speci¢city of pparq binding to
the probe, a 100-fold excess of either cold speci¢c (are7) or non-speci¢c oligonucleotides were added during the incubation of nuclear extracts
with the labeled are7 probe. each shift was performed in duplicate and the percent of total probe shifted, i.e. the amount of pparq binding,
in each sample was quantitated using the phosphorimager. the average value for each time point is graphed beneath. the data shown are representatives of six separate experiments. c: nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either no antibody, pre-sera or anti-pparq antibody (see section 2) and used in mobility shift assays.

of pparq was determined. 3t3-l1 cells were chronically
treated with either 2-bromopalmitate or troglitazone for
5 days. treatment with troglitazone or 2-bromopalmitate
caused approximately 30 to 60% reduction of pparq
mrna levels, respectively (fig. 3a). this e¡ect was also
seen with  xxxd3147xxx  suggesting that the decrease in pparq
gene expression occurs with all pparq activators, not just
troglitazone (data not shown). because pparn was shown
to be stimulated by  xxxd2154xxx  in transient reporter assays
[9,23], pparn mrna levels in cells treated with troglitazone
or 2-bromopalmitate were also examined. although pparn
mrna levels increased approximately 8-fold as di¡erentiation progressed, the chronic treatment of cells with ppar
activators did not cause notable changes in pparn mrna
levels (fig. 3b).
3.4. troglitazone down-regulates pparq mrna levels in fully
di¡erentiated adipocytes
because the troglitazone-mediated pparq down-regulation
was much more pronounced in the later stages of di¡erentia-

tion, the e¡ects of ppar activators on pparq expression in
fully di¡erentiated adipocytes were examined. eight days
post-di¡erentiated cultures were stimulated with troglitazone
for 1^12 h, and analyzed for the expression of pparq. a 60%
decrease in pparq transcripts was observed within 2 h of
troglitazone treatment and that level was maintained for 12 h
(fig. 4a). again, nuclear extracts were prepared from adipocytes treated with either troglitazone or 2-bromopalmitate for
3 or 6 h to see if the reduction of pparq mrna levels
correlated with pparq dna binding activity. a signi¢cant
reduction of pparq dna binding activity was observed in
cell extracts treated with either troglitazone or 2-bromopalmitate for 3 or 6 h (fig. 4b). therefore, this decrease in pparq
expression upon ppar ligand treatment occurs at both
mrna and dna binding activity levels. to further investigate troglitazone-mediated receptor down-regulation, we examined the e¡ect of rna synthesis inhibition by stimulating
cells with troglitazone in the presence of  xxxd1800xxx . as
shown above, troglitazone treatment caused a 50% reduction
of pparq mrna levels. however, the rate of pparq mrna

gest that this receptor down-regulation occurs via a ligandmediated negative feedback mechanism which is dependent
upon the di¡erentiation state of the 3t3-l1 cell.
we have noticed that the e¡ects of ligand on pparq expression are dependent on the overall competency of preadipocytes to become adipocytes (i.e. cell passage number and
plating density). in a well di¡erentiating line, the receptor
down-regulation occurs as early as 24 to 48 h after the addition of troglitazone in the presence of a mixture of adipogenic

of adipogenic hormones for 5 days. total rna was isolated and
analyzed for pparq mrna and l-actin levels using rpa (a), or
pparn and l-actin mrna levels using northern blot analysis (b).

degradation was una¡ected by the drug (fig. 5). thus, the
e¡ects of pparq ligand treatment on pparq mrna levels
must occur at the level of transcription.
4. discussion
through the use of ligand binding assays, kliewer and coworkers demonstrated that the anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones including troglitazone, are speci¢c ligands for pparq
[11]. in this report, we show that during the late stages of
adipocyte di¡erentiation and in adipocytes, ligand treatment
results in a down-regulation of pparq mrna, protein, and
dna binding activity. based on several observations, we sug-

kinase and phosphorylation of ser-84 (ser-112 in pparq2)
also regulate pparq1 activity [27]. thus, many factors contribute to the expression and regulation of pparq activity.
the additional knowledge that pparq expression is subject to
ligand dependent down-regulation may help us to understand
the anti-diabetic e¡ects of thiazolidinediones.

hormones. the continuous presence of troglitazone causes a
decrease in pparq gene expression and dna binding activity
during the later stages of di¡erentiation. we speculate that
during the course of di¡erentiation there is a threshold point
for which a speci¢c level of pparq activity is required for
adipogenesis to proceed and ppar activators serve to enhance the rate at which this threshold is achieved. upon attainment of the required level of ppar activity, the continued
presence of ligands causes the receptor down-regulation similar to that seen with other nuclear receptors.
auto-regulation of receptor concentration by the ligands is
well documented for numerous receptor subtypes including
the nuclear receptors [22^25]. in most studied systems, both
dexamethasone and  xxxd2493xxx  have been shown to
down-regulate the levels of the glucocorticoid and thyroid
receptors, respectively [23,24]. in rat hepatoma cells, a ligand-mediated transient decrease in  xxxg1601xxx 
was observed [23], similar to that seen with pparq in the
3t3-l1 adipocytes. the mechanisms for the ligand-induced
down-regulation of these other nuclear receptors include
both the reduced transcription and increased turnover of the
receptor mrna and protein levels [23^25]. based on  xxxd1800xxx  experiments, we have found no signi¢cant changes in
the stability of pparq mrna by troglitazone treatment.
therefore, we suggest that a decrease in mrna synthesis
accounts for the reduction in pparq message. as protein
levels also decrease dramatically after 2 h, protein degradation
must also a¡ect pparq expression.
how the auto-regulation of pparq expression manifests
itself in vivo is unclear. the e¡ects of  xxxd3147xxx  treatment
on pparq expression in adipose tissue have been described
and are dependent upon diet and the nutritional state of the
animals [26]. growth factor dependent activation of map
