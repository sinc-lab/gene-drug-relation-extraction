abstract
emedastine [l-(2-ethoxyethyl)-2-(4-methyl-l-homopiperazinyl)-benzimidazole difumarate] was
evaluated for topical ocular anti-histaminic activity in histamine and antigen stimulated conjunctivitis
models. concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine induced vascular permeability changes
occurring in the conjunctiva was observed when the time interval between topical ocular
administration and histamine challenge ranged from 1 min to 8 hr. the calculated ed50 values
obtained using intervals of 1 min, 30 min, 2,4 and 8 hr were 0.0002%, 0.000035%, 0.0029%, 0.019%
and 0.19%, w/v, respectively. comparisons of relative potency 30 min post dosing between
emedastine and other anti-histamines demonstrated that emedastine is equipotent to ketotifen, and 7,
7, 10, 10, 100, 357, 3333, and 5813 times more potent than  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine,
clemastine,  xxxd3050xxx ,  xxxd2469xxx ,  xxxd2906xxx , diphenhydramine, and  xxxd186xxx , respectively.
emedastine (0.1%) failed to significantly attenuate either serotonin or platelet-activating-factor
induced vascular permeability changes indicating high selectivity for the histamine h, receptor. in a
passive conjunctival anaphylaxis model in guinea pigs, significant inhibition of the allergic response
was observed following topical ocular administration of emedastine 5 min or 30 min prior to antigen
challenge (ed50s 0.0046% and 0.00022%, respectively). these data clearly indicate that emedastine
has potential as a topical ocular anti-histamine for treating allergic conjunctivitis.

introduction

allergic conjunctivitis,

by ocular pruritis, erythema, edema, and tearing, is
frequently treated by ophthalmologists, optometrists and allergists
(1). pharmacological intervention in this disease has been primarily through the use of topically
applied histamine h, antagonists in combination with a-adrenergic agonists (2,3,4). recently, the
anti-histamine  xxxd2469xxx  has exhibited clinical activity in allergic conjunctivitis patients without
the addition of a vasoconstrictor (5). berdy et al. (6) have demonstrated that hl antagonists are
effective in relieving not only pruritis but also conjunctival injection and erythema in human
volunteers. these reports suggest that there is a need for potent, selective, rapidly effective
anti-histamines for the topical treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

emedastine

[l-(2-ethoxyethyl)-2-(4-methyl-l-homopiperazinyl)-benzimidazole difumarate] is

potent h! antagonist. sharif et al. (7) and fukuda et al. (8) demonstrated that the compound
extremely potent and selective for the h¡ receptor. these studies were confirmed by fleisch et

one such
was

al. (9) using a number of smooth muscle preparations. in their studies emedastine produced pkb
values of 9.9, 9.9 and 9.2 on histamine induced contractions of ileum, aorta and trachea, respectively.
anti-histaminic activity in vivo following systemic (oral, intravenous) administration has also been
reported (8). in these test systems emedastine was more potent than chlorpheniramine,
diphenhydramine, clemastine and ketotifen. topical anti-histaminic activity was also observed
following pulmonary aerosol delivery in guinea pigs. the compound was more effective than either
chlorpheniramine or clemastine administered in similar fashion (10).
because of the reported potency and selectivity of emedastine, studies were undertaken to
characterize its effects following topical ocular administration in models of histamine and allergen
stimulated conjunctivitis. this report presents data obtained from those studies and compares the
effects of emedastine with those of other h, antagonists.

t test

emedastine (0.1 %), applied onto the eye 30 minutes before challenge failed to significantly
attenuate either platelet-activating-factor or serotonin induced vascular permeability changes in
conjunctiva (table 2). specificity was further evaluated using radioligand binding assays. emedastine
(10 um) did not significantly interact with the following receptors: adenosine 1 & 2, alpha 1 & 2,
beta, dopamine 1 & 2, serotonin 1 & 2, nicotinic, leukotriene b4, leukotriene d4, and thromboxane

a2 (table 3).
comparisons of emedastine's potency with those of reference anti-histamines utilizing topical
ocular administration and treatment intervals of 1 min or 30 min in the in vivo testing paradigm
described above were completed. emedastine is 3, 8, and 17 times more potent than ketotifen,
 xxxd2906xxx , and  xxxd186xxx , respectively, and approximately equipotent to  xxxd3050xxx  when
compounds are administered topically 1 min before histamine challenge (table 4).  xxxd2469xxx 
(0.05%) failed to significantly attenuate the histamine induced vascular permeability response in the
conjunctiva when administered topically 1 min before histamine injection. results obtained using a
30 min treatment interval are presented in table 5. emedastine is equipotent to ketotifen, and 7, 7,
10, 10, 100, and 3333 times more potent than  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine, clemastine,

emedastine was evaluated at concentrations of 10"5, 10"7, and 10"9 m. data are shown only for
10"5m. percent inhibition represents an average of 2 samples. negative inhibition values
reflect a slight enhancement of radioligand binding over background controls.

 xxxd2469xxx  and diphenhydramine, respectively. additionally, emedastine is approximately 357 and
5813 times more potent than  xxxd2906xxx  and  xxxd186xxx , respectively, in these studies. (approximate
potency has been calculated due to lack of parallelism.)
because of the potent, specific anti-histaminic activity described above, emedastine was
evaluated for its ability to inhibit a passive conjunctival immediate hypersensitivity response following
topical ocular administration.
significant reductions of the allergic response were observed in animals treated with 0.001%
and 0.01% solutions of emedastine 30 min before i.v. antigen challenge (table 6). the ed50 value
for emedastine obtained from this experiment is 0.00022%. in an experiment in which the allergic
response was initiated by topical ocular antigen challenge and quantified by clinical scoring,
emedastine administration 5 min before antigen challenge produced concentration-dependent
reductions in the severity of the hypersensitivity response (table 6). significant attenuation was
observed with concentrations ranging from 0.0001% to 0.1% (ed5u 0.0046%).

discussion

experimental results demonstrate that emedastine is a potent, selective, histamine
antagonist possessing a rapid onset and an acceptable duration of action following topical ocular
administration. direct comparisons of emedastine's antihistaminic potency to a number of reference
anti-histamines clearly demonstrate emedastine to be more potent than  xxxd375xxx ,
chlorpheniramine, clemastine,  xxxd3050xxx ,  xxxd2469xxx ,  xxxd2906xxx , diphenhydramine and
 xxxd186xxx . ketotifen was the only reference compound equipotent to emedastine using a 30 min
interval between topical ocular treatment and histamine challenge. in similar experiments using a 1
min interval between drug treatment and histamine challenge, emedastine was 3, 8 and 17 times more
potent than ketotifen,  xxxd2906xxx  and  xxxd186xxx , respectively, and approximately equipotent to
 xxxd3050xxx , four drugs marketed for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.
the potency data agree with the report by fukuda et al. (8) that orally administered
emedastine was 3, 39 and 780 times more potent than ketotifen, chlorpheniramine and
diphenhydramine, respectively, at preventing histamine induced mortality in guinea pigs and 4 and
27 times more potent than ketotifen and chlorpheniramine at preventing histamine induced increases
in vascular permeability.
 xxxd2469xxx  evaluated at the marketed concentration (0.05 %) failed to significantly inhibit
the histamine induced response when administered immediately prior to challenge while emedastine
(0.01%) inhibited the response by 92% in this experiment.  xxxd2469xxx  has been reported to inhibit

administered 30 min before histamine challenge, the drug was 100 times less potent than emedastine
in this study. the immediate onset of action and the potency noted with emedastine suggests that a
rapid therapeutic effect can be anticipated. this offers advantages to allergic conjunctivitis patients.
emedastine's ability to inhibit increases in vascular permeability is agonist specific.
concentrations of emedastine which produce significant inhibition of the histamine induced response
failed to significantly inhibit either serotonin- or paf-induced increases in vascular permeability.
selectivity is further demonstrated by the lack of interaction noted with emedastine (10 |im)  xxxd2216xxx 
adrenergic, dopamine d2, serotonin s2, and numerous other receptors. fleisch et al. (9) using a variety
of smooth muscle preparations from rat and guinea pig evaluated the selectivity of emedastine for the
histamine hl receptor. they found that emedastine was inactive against leukotriene d4, bradykinin,
prostaglandin f2a, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. additionally, no effect was noted on
histamine  xxxg1079xxx  mediated relaxation of the rat uterus. the selectivity of emedastine compares
favorably to that of  xxxd2469xxx  which has been reported to interact with dopamine d2, alpha 1
adrenergic and serotonin s2 receptors (17).
the high degree of selectivity noted above suggests emedastine will have minimal side-effect
potential. mydriasis, increases in intraocular pressure, and dryness of the mucous membranes
associated with anticholinergic effects are ocular side-effects reported with topical anti-histamine use
(18). topical anti-histamine-vasoconstrictor combinations have been reported to be more likely to
produce pupil dilation and elevated intraocular pressure than single entity products (19). emedastine
did not display any significant anticholinergic activity (9) or alpha adrenergic activity as described
above. extensive neuropharmacological studies indicate that emedastine does not inhibit a conditioned
avoidance response or cause changes in spontaneous eeg at doses as high as 20 mg/kg. no effect
was noted on monosynaptic or polysynaptic reflexes following treatment with emedastine (20). the
local anaesthetic activity of the compound was also evaluated using the corneal reflex in guinea pigs
and measurements of action potential of desheathed frog sciatic nerve fiber. emedastine at a
concentration of 4.0% (w/v) produced no local anaesthetic effect on corneal reflex. at a concentration
of 500 u-m the compound did not influence action potentials of frog sciatic nerve (21).
topical ocular application of emedastine to sensitized guinea pigs significantly and dosedependently inhibited i.v. and topically administered antigen stimulated allergic conjunctivitis
responses. guinea pig allergic responses possess a strong histaminic component (22, 23). it has been
672

that histamine h, antagonists effectively inhibit experimental allergic conjunctivitis (24).
woodward et al. (25) have reported that the conjunctival microvascular permeability response is
mediated by histamine h, receptor activation. therefore, it is not surprising that topical emedastine
significantly decreases the immediate hypersensitivity response occurring in the guinea pig

reported

conjunctiva.

the data obtained from the present investigations clearly demonstrate emedastine to be a
selective, topically effective, extremely potent anti-histamine with a rapid onset and acceptable

duration of action in preclinical models of conjunctivitis. emedastine exhibits superior potency
compared to anti-histamines which are effective in clinical practice (6) as well as other reference
anti-histamines examined. because the acute symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mediated in large
part by histamine released from conjunctival mast cells acting upon h, receptors, the use of a potent
histamine h[ receptor antagonist for topical therapeutic intervention is warranted.
