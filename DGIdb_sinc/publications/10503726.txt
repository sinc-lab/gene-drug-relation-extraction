abstract
acute treatment with ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  [⌬ xxxd1943xxx ; 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg b.w. intravenously (i.v.)], the major psychoactive constituent
of marijuana, produces a dose-related suppression of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (lh) secretion in ovariectomized rats. to determine
whether ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  produces this response by altering neurotransmitter and/or neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of lh
secretion, ovariectomized rats were pretreated with antagonists for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, or opioid receptors, and the effect
of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on lh release was determined. pretreatment with the  xxxg656xxx  antagonists butaclamol (1.0 mg/kg b.w., intraperitoneally) or
 xxxd2956xxx  [0.63 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)], the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone (1-4 mg/kg, i.v.) or naltrexone (2 mg/kg, i.v.), the
noradrenergic ␣2-receptor antagonist idazoxan (10 ␮g/kg, i.v.), or the serotonin  xxxg1115xxx /2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (1 or 5 mg/kg b.w.,
i.p.), did not alter ⌬ xxxd1943xxx -induced inhibition of pulsatile lh secretion. pretreatment with a relatively high dose of the ␤-adrenergic receptor
blocker propranolol (6 mg/kg, i.v.) attenuated the ability of the low thc dose to inhibit lh release; however, lower doses of propranolol
were without effect. furthermore, the ability of a relatively nonspecific serotonin 5-ht1a/1b receptor antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  (4 mg/kg, s.c.) or
the specific  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way-100635 (1 mg/kg, s.c.) to significantly attenuate thc-induced lh suppression indicates that
activation of serotonergic 5-ht1a receptors may be an important mode by which thc causes inhibition of lh release in the ovariectomized
rat. © 1999 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
marijuana or ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  (⌬ xxxd1943xxx ), the
predominate psychoactive constituent in marijuana, has pronounced effects on luteinizing hormone (lh) secretion in
humans and experimental animals [1–5]. in females, ⌬9thc has been shown to block the proestrous preovulatory
lh surge in gonadal-intact animals [6] and to produce
dose-related inhibition of pulsatile lh release in ovariectomized rats [7]. the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to inhibit lh secretion appears to be due to an action of thc within the central
nervous system (for review, see ref. [8]). indeed, direct
intracerebroventricular administration of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  produces
decreased plasma lh levels and increased hypothalamic
levels of  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh; ref. [9]).
this suggests that decreased release of gnrh into the

pituitary portal vasculature is responsible for the suppressed
levels of lh following ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment.
whether ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  inhibits gnrh release through a direct
effect on gnrh neurons or indirectly through regulation of
neuromodulatory neurons that synapse on gnrh neurons is
not known. cannabinoids do not appear to directly block
basal gnrh secretion from hypothalami in vitro [10]. however, there is considerable evidence that cannabinoids affect
the activity of neuronal systems known to inhibit gnrh
secretion in ovariectomized rats, including norepinephrine,
dopamine, serotonin,  xxxg517xxx 
(crh), and the endogenous opioid peptides ␤-endorphin
and  xxxg1801xxx  [8]. furthermore, several studies have
shown a clear temporal correlation between alterations in
neurotransmitter or neuropeptide activity and suppressed
lh or testosterone levels following acute ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment
[3,11,12]. increases in hypothalamic norepinephrine and
dopamine activity, concomitant with decreased lh release,
have been reported in ⌬ xxxd1943xxx -treated rats [3]. moreover,
hypothalamic  xxxg1801xxx  levels are increased during

⌬ xxxd1943xxx -induced suppression of testosterone levels in male
rats [13]. we recently reported that elevations in crh
following acute ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment may have a role in the
suppression of lh by cannabinoids [14]. pretreatment of
ovariectomized rats with the crh receptor antagonist ␣-helical crh attenuated the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to inhibit basal
lh release. the inability of ␣-helical crh to completely
prevent the inhibitory effect of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on lh release
suggests that other neurotransmitter/neuropeptide systems
are involved. in the present study, the potential role of
norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and endogenous opioid peptides in mediating the suppression of lh release by
⌬ xxxd1943xxx  will be addressed.

2. experimental
2.1. animals
adult female sprague–dawley rats of the hsd(sd)br
strain were obtained from harlan sprague–dawley, inc.
(indianapolis, in, usa) at a body weight of 150 –175 g and
individually housed in the southern illinois university–
carbondale vivarium in environmentally controlled animal
quarters illuminated by fluorescent lighting 12 h each day
(06:00-18:00 h). teklad laboratory chow and water were
provided ad libitum. approximately 2 weeks after animals
were brought into the facility, bilateral ovariectomies were
performed via flank incisions while the animals were maintained under ether anesthesia. all experimental protocols
were performed in accordance with the regulations in the
‘guide for the care and use of laboratory animals’ published by the public health service.
2.2. treatment protocol
four weeks after ovariectomy and 24 h before the experiment, a polyethylene cannula was surgically implanted
into the right jugular vein under ether anesthesia for the
purpose of drug administration and blood withdrawal. ⌬9thc of greater than 95% purity was provided in ethanol by
the national institute on drug abuse. immediately before
use, the ethanol was evaporated under nitrogen at 45–50°c,
and the residue was emulsified in a vehicle consisting of
10%  xxxd3034xxx  and 1% tween-80 in 0.9% saline.
the dopamine receptor antagonists butaclamol [1 mg/kg
b.w., intraperitoneally (i.p.) in 1% tween-80 in 0.9% saline]
or  xxxd2956xxx  [0.63 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.) in 0.1 m
tartaric acid or their respective vehicles were administered
2.5 h prior to treatment with ⌬ xxxd1943xxx . the opioid receptor
antagonists naloxone [1, 2, or 4 mg/kg b.w., intravenously
(i.v.)] or naltrexone (2 mg/kg b.w., i.v.) or saline vehicle
was administered 10 min before ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  administration.
the ␣2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, idazoxan (10 ␮g/kg
b.w., i.v.), the ␤-adrenergic receptor blocker (-)-propranolol
hcl (2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg b.w., i.v.), or saline vehicle was

665

administered 1 h before ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment. a serotonin
5-ht1a/1b receptor antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  (4 mg/kg b.w., s.c.
in 0.1 m tartaric acid), the specific  xxxg1115xxx /2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (1 or 5 mg/kg b.w., i.p. in 0.1 m tartaric
acid) or the specific  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist
way100635 maleate (1 mg/kg b.w., s.c. in water) were
given 1 h ( xxxd2957xxx , ritanserin) or 30 min (way100635)
before ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment. all drugs were received from
rbi (natick, ma, usa) unless otherwise specified.
blood samples (0.4 cc) were drawn at times 0, 10, 30, 60,
and 120 min with the first sample obtained immediately
before ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg b.w.) or vehicle administration (time 0). blood was placed in microcentrifuge
conicals containing heparinized saline (1u/10 ␮l). after
each blood withdrawal, samples were centrifuged at
1800 ⫻ g for 2 min. plasma was aspirated and stored at
⫺70°c for lh determinations, and red blood cells were
resuspended in 0.9% saline and reinjected into the respective animal following the subsequent blood withdrawal.
2.3. hormone assay
plasma lh was determined in duplicate by radioimmunoassay using reagents supplied by the national hormone
and pituitary program (bethesda, md, usa). briefly,
plasma samples (50 ␮l) and reference preparation
(niaddk-rat lh-rp-3) were brought to a volume of 200
␮l using 0.01 m phosphate buffer containing 1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  fraction v (sigma) at ph 7.6 before the
addition of antibody and tracer. anti-rat lh serum
(niaddk-anti-rat-lh-s-9), diluted 1:41250 in 0.01 m
phosphate buffer containing 0.05 m edta and 2% normal
rabbit serum, was added to sample tubes in a volume of 100
␮l and incubated at room temperature for 24 h together with
iodinated niaddk-rat-i-9 (10 000 cpm/100 ␮l/tube),
which was generated using chloramine-t. goat anti-rabbitg-globulin second antibody (1.0 u/100 ␮l/tube; calbiochem) was added for an additional 24-h incubation at room
temperature. free tracer was separated from the antibodybound tracer by centrifugation (2000 ⫻ g for 30 min at
4°c). the sensitivity of the assay was 0.2 ng/ml with interand intra-assay coefficients of variance of 8.8 and 7.6%,
respectively.
2.4. statistical analyses
each experimental group consisted of 8 –10 animals, and
data are presented as means ⫾ sem. comparisons between
pre- and post-drug responses in the same animals were
made using one-way analysis of variance (anova) with
repeated measures followed by scheffé’s test. comparisons
between responses in drug and vehicle-treated groups were
made using two-way anova. differences were considered
to be significant if p ⬍ 0.05.

3.1. results
in ovariectomized rats, the acute administration of ⌬9thc produced a dose-related decrease in plasma lh levels
(fig. 1). within 30 min of treatment, both doses of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx 
(0.5 and 1 mg/kg) significantly reduced lh release by
approximately 70% when compared to vehicle controls
(p ⬍ 0.05). at 60 min after treatment, plasma lh levels in
animals receiving the low-dose ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  were not different
from vehicle controls; however, lh levels remained suppressed (p ⬍ 0.05) in animals receiving the high ⌬ xxxd1943xxx 
dose. by 120 min post-treatment, there were no differences
in lh levels between vehicle and the ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  groups.
in figure 2, the effects of pretreatment with dopamine
receptor antagonists on the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  (0.5 mg/kg) to
inhibit lh release is depicted. pretreatment with either the
dopamine d2/d1-receptor antagonist butaclamol (1 mg/kg)
or the d2-receptor antagonist  xxxd2956xxx  (0.63 mg/kg) did not
prevent the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to decrease lh levels 30 min
after cannabinoid administration. fig. 3 shows the effects of
pretreatment with opioid receptor antagonists on the ability
of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to alter plasma lh levels. neither naloxone
(data not shown) nor naltrexone pretreatment, blocked the
inhibitory effect of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on lh release.
the effects of pretreatment with noradrenergic receptor
antagonists on ⌬ xxxd1943xxx -induced lh suppression is shown
in fig. 4. pretreatment with idazoxan (0.01 mg/kg), a noradrenergic ␣2-receptor antagonist, did not prevent the ⌬9thc-induced decrease in lh levels at 30 min after cannabinoid treatment. in fig. 5, pretreatment with the low dose
of the noradrenergic ␤-receptor antagonist propranolol (2
mg/kg) also did not alter the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to suppress
lh release. however, when animals were pretreated with
the 6 mg/kg dose of propranolol, the inhibitory effect of
⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on lh release at 30 min was prevented. indeed, at

30 min post ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment, plasma lh levels in animals
pretreated with the higher propranolol dose were not significantly different from time 0 pretreatment lh values in the
same treatment group.
in fig. 6, the effect of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on plasma lh levels in
ovariectomized rats pretreated with various serotonin receptor antagonists is described. pretreatment with either dose of
ritanserin, a potent 5-ht2/ xxxg1115xxx  receptor antagonist, did
not affect the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to decrease plasma lh
levels at 30 min. interestingly, both  xxxd2957xxx , a 5-ht1a and
noradrenergic ␤-receptor antagonist, and way100635, a
selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, prevented the ability
of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to suppress lh release. the plasma lh concentrations at 30 min post-thc treatment in animals pretreated
with either  xxxd2957xxx  or way100635 were not different from
time 0 pretreatment lh levels.

4. discussion
this study is the first to test the effects of a wide variety
of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptor blockers on
the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to alter lh release in vivo. the doses
of receptor antagonists selected for use in this study were
based on earlier studies which demonstrated that these doses
were effective in blocking the neuroendocrine effects of
their respective agonists in either ovariectomized female or
male rats [15,16]. furthermore, as shown in figs. 2–5,
pretreatment with receptor antagonist alone did not appear
to affect basal lh release prior to ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment. thus,
the doses of the different receptor blockers utilized in this
study should provide relevant information with regard to the
potential role of specific neurotransmitters and endogenous
opioid peptides in the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to suppress lh
release.

the results strongly indicate that activation of serotonin
5-ht1a receptors is involved in the suppression of lh
release following ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment in ovariectomized rats.
this is supported by the findings that pretreatment with the
selective  xxxg1108xxx  blocker way100635, and the
less specific  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist  xxxd2957xxx , prevented
the suppression of lh release following ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment.
furthermore, the noradrenergic ␤-blocker propranolol,
which also acts as a  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist [17], prevented the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to inhibit lh release in ovariectomized animals. although these results indicate that noradrenergic ␤-receptors may also be involved in the ability of

⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to alter lh release, the findings that way100635
and  xxxd2957xxx  and only a high dose of propranolol blocked
the effects of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on lh secretion, support the hypothesis that serotonin 5-ht1a receptors are primarily responsible. that 5-ht1a receptors are specifically involved in this
neuroendocrine effect of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  is further supported by
the finding that ritanserin, a 5-ht2/ xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, was
without effect.
specific receptors for cannabinoids have recently been
identified in brain (cb1; [18,19]) and peripheral tissues
(cb2; [20,21]) that mediate the psychotropic effects and
immunosuppressive actions of cannabinoids, respectively

[21,22]. treatment of ovariectomized rats with the cb1
receptor agonists cp55,940, win55,212-2 or anandamide,
an endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors [23], produces a dose-dependent inhibition of lh secretion with
cp55,940 ⬎ win55,212-2 ⬎ anandamide [24,25] in direct
correlation with the potency of these drugs in pharmacological and binding studies [26]. thus, cannabinoid receptors
appear to mediate the suppressive effects of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on lh
release in female rats. using specific cannabinoid receptor
agonists, studies have shown that cb1 receptors are located
on presynaptic terminals where they have been shown to
modulate acetylcholine [27], glutamate [28], and norepinephrine release [29] in cultured neurons or brain slices.

several lines of evidence suggest an interaction between
cannabinoids and the serotonergic system. it has been reported that ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  increases serotonin synthesis [30 –32],
alters serotonin release [33–35] and blocks serotonin reuptake [33], although the mechanism of this cannabinoid
action remains unclear. because serotonin is inhibitory to
lh release in ovariectomized rats [36], the current results
suggest that ⌬ xxxd1943xxx -induced increases in synaptic serotonin levels result in increased binding to post-synaptic serotonin 5-ht1a receptors and lh suppression. it is unclear
whether serotonin receptors are localized on gnrh neurons
[37]; however serotoninergic neurons have been shown to
directly synapse on crh-immunoreactive neurons [38],

where enhanced serotonin activity causes an increase in
crh release [39]. in light of the findings demonstrating that
crh is inhibitory to gnrh release [40,41], it is possible
that crh mediates the inhibitory effects of serotonin on lh
release following acute ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment. indeed, earlier
findings from this laboratory demonstrated that the crh
receptor antagonist ␣-helical crh, significantly attenuated
the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to inhibit lh secretion in ovariectomized rats [14].
the acute administration of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  produces dose- and
time-dependent changes in hypothalamic catecholaminergic

[3] and opioidergic activity [13]. in ovariectomized, steroidprimed rats, naloxone pretreatment blocked the ability of
acute ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  treatment to inhibit the steroid-induced lh
surge [42]. although opioidergic mechanisms may be important in mediating the inhibitory effects of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on the
preovulatory lh surge, the current study demonstrated that
endogenous opioid peptides may be less important in mediating the effects of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  on basal pulsatile lh secretion. neither pretreatment with naloxone nor the longeracting naltrexone affected ⌬ xxxd1943xxx ’s ability to suppress
basal lh release. in ovariectomized animals, the absence of

ovarian steroids promotes an inhibitory role of norepinephrine on lh release possibly as a result of decreased noradrenergic-␣1 receptor function and an increase in ␣2- and
␤-adrenoceptor activity [43]. in the current study, blocking
the potential inhibitory influence of norepinephrine on lh
release by pretreating rats with idazoxan or a low dose
propranolol, did not prevent the inhibitory effect of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx 
on lh secretion. a higher dose of propranolol did prevent
⌬ xxxd1943xxx ’s ability to inhibit lh release, suggesting that
propranolol in higher doses was blocking 5-ht1a receptors
and/or that blocking ␤-adrenoceptors also prevented ⌬9thc’s actions on lh release. in vitro studies using mouse
cerebral cortex synaptosomes, revealed that ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  increased the binding of noradrenergic agonists to ␤-adrenoceptors [44] which suggests that in vivo ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  could
increase binding of norepinephrine to inhibitory ␤-adrenoceptors in ovariectomized rats.
due to the high density of cannabinoid receptors in
many parts of the brain [18,19], including the cortex,
hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, in addition
to less dense localization of cannabinoid receptor in hypothalamic areas, it is likely that the ability of ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  to
alter hormone secretion is mediated by an accumulation
of various actions of the drug on neurotransmitter and
neuropeptide systems. the current study has identified
the importance of serotoninergic  xxxg1108xxx  activation as one plausible mechanism by which ⌬ xxxd1943xxx  may
act to inhibit lh release.
