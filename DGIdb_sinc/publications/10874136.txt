protective action of cardiac dt- xxxg641xxx  against  xxxd2563xxx  toxicity in guinea pig isolated atria.  in myocardial preparations isolated from guinea pigs, 2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone ( xxxd2563xxx ) causes an increase in contractility that is strictly related to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) as a consequence of quinone metabolism. in heart,  xxxd2563xxx  undergoes one-electron reduction to semiquinone, a reaction mainly catalysed by mitochondrial nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase. it is also converted to hydroquinone by the soluble two-electron reductase, dt- xxxg641xxx , and is conjugated with gsh by  xxxg1073xxx . in order to assess the role of dt- xxxg641xxx  in cardiac responses to  xxxd2563xxx , we examined the effects of both a specific inhibitor ( xxxd1875xxx ) and an inducer (beta-naphthoflavone) of the enzyme on the inotropic action of the quinone. in electrically driven left atria of guinea pig, 4 microm  xxxd1875xxx  significantly enhanced the positive inotropic effect of  xxxd2563xxx , especially at the lower concentrations of the quinone. in myocardial preparations isolated from guinea pigs treated with beta-naphthoflavone (80 mg/kg i.p.for 2 days), dt- xxxg641xxx  activity was enhanced (+36% with respect to control animals, p < 0. 01), whereas the activities of the other enzymes involved in  xxxd2563xxx  metabolism were not modified. in these preparations,  xxxd2563xxx  caused a significantly lower increase in the force of contraction than in atria from untreated animals; moreover, pretreatment with beta-naphthoflavone caused a significant decrease in the  xxxd2563xxx -induced oxidative stress, as evaluated from the gsh redox index. taken together, these results demonstrate that cardiac dt- xxxg641xxx  does not contribute to ros generation, but represents a detoxification system.
