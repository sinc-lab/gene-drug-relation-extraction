abstract: niemann-pick disease type c (np-c) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
by progressive neurological deterioration leading to premature death. the disease is caused by
mutations in one of two genes, npc1 or npc2, leading to impaired intracellular lipid transport
and build-up of lipids in various tissues, particularly the brain.  xxxd2645xxx  ( xxxd2645xxx ®), a reversible
inhibitor of glycosphingolipid synthesis, has recently been authorized in the european union,
brazil and south korea for the treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and
pediatric patients, and represents the first specific treatment for np-c. here we review current
data on the pharmacology, efficacy, safety and tolerability of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with np-c,
based on findings from a prospective clinical trial, preclinical and retrospective studies, and
case reports. findings demonstrated clinically relevant beneficial effects of  xxxd2645xxx  on neurological disease progression in adult, juvenile and pediatric patients with np-c, particularly
those diagnosed in late childhood (6–11 years) and in juveniles and adults (12 years and older),
compared with those diagnosed in early childhood (younger than 6 years).  xxxd2645xxx  therapy
was well-tolerated in all age groups. with the approval of  xxxd2645xxx , treatment of patients with
np-c can now be aimed toward stabilizing neurological disease, which is likely the best attainable therapeutic goal for this disorder.

niemann-pick disease type c (np-c) is a rare, panethnic, autosomal recessive disease
with an incidence estimated at between 1:120,000 and 1:150,000 live births.1–3 np-c is
characterized by progressive neurological deterioration leading to premature death.
the disease is caused by mutations in either one of two genes, npc1 or npc2. npc1
gene mutations are present in 95% of cases, and npc2 mutations are present in
approximately 4%.4–7 the remainder of patients are biochemically-proven cases who
do not have identified mutations.
mutations in npc1 and npc2 give rise to severe abnormalities in the intracellular transport of lipid, notably cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and sphingosine.8–12
the npc1 or npc2 gene products normally function cooperatively in intracellular lipid
transport,8,13,14 and so impaired function leads to the accumulation of lipids in the lateendosomal and lysosomal intracellular compartments, resulting in the build-up of excess
lipids in various tissues. in the liver and spleen, excess storage of unesterified cholesterol,
sphingomyelin, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, glycosphingolipids and sphingosine
can lead to visceral symptoms such as organomegaly and liver dysfunction,15–18 while
increased levels of glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and particularly gm2 and gm3

gangliosides in the brain could contribute to the neurological
manifestations of the disease.19
np-c has an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation characterized by a wide range of symptoms that are not
specific to the disease, and which arise and progress over
varied periods of time.1,7 presenting manifestations differ
according to the individual patient and are heavily dependent
on the patient’s age at the onset of disease. diagnosis can
therefore be difficult and is often delayed by several years
after presentation of the first symptoms. a clinical diagnosis
of np-c requires in-depth screening for characteristic neurological (as well as systemic) features, and must be confirmed
by laboratory biochemical and/or molecular genetic testing.1,3
the key laboratory diagnostic test for np-c is filipin staining
of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient, to demonstrate
free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes secondary to
impaired intracellular cholesterol transport.20 evaluation of
the rate of intracellular cholesterol esterification is a useful
complementary test.20 molecular genetic testing for npc1
and npc2 gene mutations is also vital to confirm diagnoses
in patients with a variant biochemical phenotype, as well as
to enable early and reliable prenatal diagnosis.20
until recently, treatment for np-c has been limited to
supportive measures, for relief of specific manifestations of
the disease. anti-epileptics to control seizures, antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy and anticholinergics to
control tremor and dystonia may all be employed to help
improve the quality of life of np-c patients.3,21,22 systemic
manifestations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms can be
managed with anti-diarrheal medications, and simple measures such as softening of food for patients with dysphagia
can also be beneficial.3
a number of experimental disease-specific therapies,
based on the molecular pathology of np-c, have been tested
in cell culture and animal models. these include neurosteroids and cholesterol-binding agents, which have been
shown to delay the progression of disease in animal models
of np-c.23–25 direct or indirect overexpression of the gtpase,
rab 9, has been shown to reverse the np-c phenotype in tissue culture26,27 and reduce stored lipids and prolong lifespan
in a mouse model of np-c.28 recently, curcumin has been
suggested to have beneficial effects on intracellular calcium
homeostasis and lipid metabolism in npc1-mutant mice.29
however, data from clinical studies are required to assess the
possible role of these compounds in np-c therapy.
 xxxd2645xxx  ( xxxd2645xxx ®; actelion pharmaceuticals ltd,
allschwil, switzerland) is the first and only approved therapy
for patients with np-c.  xxxd2645xxx  is a small iminosugar

molecule that reversibly inhibits glycosphingolipid
synthesis.30  xxxd2645xxx  is approved in the european union
(eu), usa, canada, brazil, australia, turkey, israel,
switzerland, south korea and new zealand for the treatment
of patients with mild to moderate type 1 gaucher disease
(gd1) for whom enzyme replacement therapy (ert) is
unsuitable or not a therapeutic option. recently, the eu
commission extended  xxxd2645xxx ’s indication to include the
treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult
patients and pediatric patients with np-c. this was followed
by authorization in brazil and south korea. these approvals
were based on findings from preclinical studies, a prospective clinical trial and a retrospective cohort study. here we
review the current literature on the pharmacology, efficacy,
safety and tolerability of  xxxd2645xxx  in np-c.

neurological manifestations
in np-c
both the symptomatology and the rate of disease progression
of np-c are heavily influenced by the age of the patient at the
onset of disease.1,3,31–33 in neonates and infants, np-c typically
manifests as organomegaly and severe liver dysfunction,
while later onset forms are primarily neurological in nature.
in late infantile-onset patients, np-c typically presents
as ataxia, cognitive impairment and clumsiness. impaired
vertical saccadic eye movements are invariably present,
but are often overlooked. gelastic cataplexy and epileptic
seizures are also common; progressive dystonia, dysphagia
and dysarthria manifest as the disease advances.34–36 these
manifestations also feature in juvenile- or adult-onset
disease; however learning disabilities (often leading to school
failure), behavioral problems, psychiatric signs and slowlyprogressive motor problems are also common in these age
groups.3,31,33,37,38 cognitive impairment and dementia are most
commonly seen in adult-onset patients.
in an observational retrospective study of the natural
history of neurological disease in 57 patients with np-c,31
patients were assessed using a modified version of an
np-c specific disability scale,32 which rated the severity
of defects in ambulation, manipulation, language and
swallowing. overall, the rate of neurological deterioration
was similar across all four measures. however, progression of neurological disease was consistently more rapid
in patients who were diagnosed during early childhood
(younger than 6 years), compared with those diagnosed
in late childhood (6 to 11 years) or with juvenile or adult
presentation (12 years or older)31 (figure 1). similarly,
studies of patients with np-c in the uk and spain have

also indicated a more rapid progression of disease and early
death in patients with early-onset np-c, and slower, more
subtle progression in juvenile- and adult-onset patients.32,33
a study in patients with np-c in the us has also recently
demonstrated linear disease progression, but did not detect
a link between age of onset and the rate of progression.37
this was likely due to the small size and varied nature of the
patient cohort, which had very few juvenile or adult-onset
patients. in addition, patients were undergoing various
therapies during the study, which may have confounded
the study results.
since np-c is primarily a neurological disease, at least in
patients whose symptoms develop in early childhood or later,
any effective treatment for np-c needs to be able to cross
the blood–brain barrier in order to prevent further neuronal
damage. while the precise sequence of neuropathological
changes leading to neurological disease progression in np-c
is not currently clear, it is considered likely that symptoms
arise from two populations of brain cells: those that have
been lost via cell death and those that are dysfunctional,
but still viable. in either case, permanent neuronal damage
will already have occurred by the time most patients are
diagnosed with np-c. one study has suggested that the
appearance of clinical symptoms may indicate that overall
neuronal impairment has reached a threshold level, and that
pathological functional changes have become irreversible.37
there is the possibility that certain symptoms of np-c could

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2009:5

be associated with dysfunctional (but still living) cells.
however, given the vast heterogeneity of neuropathologies
and clinical neurological manifestations in np-c, it is not
currently considered possible to discern whether changes
(improvement or deterioration) in certain symptoms may
be related to direct therapeutic effects on subpopulations of
brain cells, or just a product of patient-to-patient variability.
overall, experts agree that in most patients with np-c, stabilization of neurological disease is likely the best attainable
therapeutic goal.3 therapeutic benefits with  xxxd2645xxx  in
np-c are therefore considered in terms of delaying or halting
the progression of neurological manifestations of np-c.
due to the heterogeneous nature of neurological
manifestations in np-c, the choice of clinical endpoints
and monitoring techniques is vast. so far, no clinical tools
have been validated for monitoring disease progression in
patients with np-c; nevertheless, clinical studies are a source
of valuable information on which assessment measures may
have the most clinical utility. the functional disability scale
used by iturriaga et al32 and modified for the observational
study of neurological disease progression in np-c,31 incorporates four parameters of disease that are clinically relevant
across all age groups that typically experience neurological
manifestations, and is a simple, easy-to-use instrument for the
assessment of progression of neurological disease. although
it has yet to undergo formal validation studies, the scale has
been shown to be capable of detecting differences in severity

and progression rates between different age subgroups of
patients with np-c.31,32
one limitation of the functional disability scale is that
it does not capture psychiatric symptoms; for patients with
psychiatric impairment, various neuropsychiatric evaluations
are available, including the mini-mental state examination
(mmse) as a general measure of cognition,39 and the frontal
assessment battery (fab),40 which evaluates cognitive
domains that are most commonly affected in np-c, particularly late-stage patients with predominantly frontal dementia.
magnetic resonance imaging (mri) may also be a useful
measure for detecting these late changes, particularly for
the detection of cerebellar atrophy in later stages of disease.
in addition, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (h-mrsi), by evaluation of choline/creatine ratios, has
been proposed as a more sensitive imaging technique to
monitor disease progression in np-c.41
as supranuclear gaze palsy is a common neurological
manifestation of np-c that occurs across the age groups,
ophthalmic measures, such as saccadic eye movement
(sem), have been employed to measure the effect of
treatment on neurological manifestations in patients with
np-c.42 specialized assessments of sem can be conducted
based on video-recorded eye movements, and subsequent
computerized measurements of peak velocity, amplitude
and duration of either or both of horizontal or vertical eye
movements. however, the clinical validity of sem data has
been questioned; there is some debate over whether these
measures are related to overall disease severity, as they do not
always correlate with other clinical parameters.43 sem data
may therefore not fully detect clinical benefit from treatment
in patients with np-c.

pharmacology and
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2645xxx 
mode of action
 xxxd2645xxx  is a small iminosugar molecule that acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme  xxxg2376xxx ,
which catalyzes the first committed step in glycosphingolipid (gsl) synthesis, the glycosylation of ceramide.30
this inhibits the synthesis of all glucosylceramide-derived
glycosphingolipids. the inhibition of gsl synthesis by
 xxxd2645xxx  has been demonstrated to reduce pathological
intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal
uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood b
lymphocytes of np-c patients.44 this leads to a reduction of
the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gangliosides gm2
and gm3, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, and may

prevent further neuronal damage. this is thought to be the
primary mode of action of  xxxd2645xxx  in np-c.
recent studies have suggested that  xxxd2645xxx  indirectly
modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis through its
effects on glucosylceramide levels.45 there is evidence to
suggest that impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage may be an initiating factor in the pathogenesis
of np-c.29 sphingosine accumulates in the lysosomes of
npc1-mutant cells, and this is thought to inhibit lysosomal
calcium uptake, as demonstrated in a study using human and
mouse npc1-mutant cells.29 depletion of lysosomal calcium
leads to impaired endocytic function and subsequent lipid
storage, thus inducing the np-c disease phenotype. the
effect of  xxxd2645xxx  on intracellular calcium levels might
therefore influence an important underlying pathogenetic
mechanism of np-c.

pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2645xxx  have not been assessed in
patients with np-c, but are likely to be similar to those seen in
patients with gd1. in patients with gd1,  xxxd2645xxx  is rapidly
absorbed after oral administration; the time taken to reach
maximal plasma drug concentration (tmax) is approximately
2 to 2.5 hours. the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd2645xxx  is at
least 80%. although taking  xxxd2645xxx  with a fatty meal can
extend tmax, this effect is not considered clinically relevant.
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2645xxx  in gd1 are approximately
dose-proportional,46, 47 and the mean volume of distribution
is large, at around 83 to 105 l. this indicates that  xxxd2645xxx 
is not restricted to the bloodstream, and can distribute into
extravascular tissues.47 data from animal studies have confirmed that  xxxd2645xxx  has specific physico-chemical properties (including lipid solubility and electrical charge) that
allow wide tissue distribution, and the ability to cross the
blood–brain barrier.48 this wide tissue distribution is essential
to enable  xxxd2645xxx  to reach all of the affected body tissues
and organs in np-c, particularly the brain.
although  xxxd2645xxx  can penetrate the blood–brain barrier,
concentrations of the drug in the cerebrospinal fluid are lower
than plasma levels. to compensate for this, a higher dose
than the 100 mg 3 times daily recommended in gd1, which
is primarily a systemic disease, is required for patients with
np-c. a dose of 200 mg three times daily was therefore
selected for adult patients, which should be reduced in
proportion to body surface area in pediatric patients. the
three-times-daily dosing regimen is a result of the fact that
 xxxd2645xxx  remains in the body for around 8 hours, and must
therefore be taken three times daily to maintain therapeutic

levels.  xxxd2645xxx  is not metabolized in vivo, and so has a
low mean rate of clearance from the body (mainly via the
kidneys) of 11.8 to 13.8 l/hour.47 the half-life of  xxxd2645xxx 
of 6 to 7 hours predicts that steady-state conditions will be
achieved soon after treatment initiation. in clinical studies
of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with gd1, steady-state was reached
after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment.49

effects of  xxxd2645xxx  in animal models
of np-c
the discovery that  xxxd2645xxx  has the ability to cross the
blood–brain barrier and reduce intracellular lipid storage in
np-c cell culture models led to a study of the effect of the
drug in animal models of np-c. in np-c mice, only 11% of
animals treated with  xxxd2645xxx  developed an np-c clinical
phenotype after 50 to 62 days, while 78% of non-treated mice
displayed the same manifestations.50 by 65 to 78 days, all
of the non-treated mice had developed symptoms of np-c,
compared with 56% of treated mice. mean survival in treated
mice was 89 days, compared with 67 days in untreated mice.50
cerebellar pathology and storage of gm2 and gm3 gangliosides
were also shown to be reduced in the treated mice compared
with those that did not receive treatment. these findings
suggest that  xxxd2645xxx  can delay the progression of np-c
and prolong survival. similarly, in a feline model of np-c,
cats treated with  xxxd2645xxx  showed a delay in the onset and
progression of symptoms.50 ganglioside accumulation in the
brain was also reduced.50

efficacy
following positive results from preclinical and animal studies,
a prospective, randomized clinical trial ( xxxd2645xxx -007) was
designed and implemented to assess the efficacy, safety and
tolerability of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with np-c. juvenile or
adult patients (aged 12 years or older) were enrolled, and
randomized to either  xxxd2645xxx  200 mg three times daily
(n = 20) or standard care (n = 9).43 the randomized phase of the
study was 12 months in duration. in parallel to this randomized
trial, a pediatric sub-study assessed the effects of  xxxd2645xxx 
in children (n = 12) aged from 4 to 11 years with np-c.43,51
these pediatric patients received open-label  xxxd2645xxx  for
12 months at a dose adjusted for their body weight.
in adult and juvenile patients, improvements in the
primary endpoint, horizontal saccadic eye movement peak
velocity (hsem-alpha) were seen in  xxxd2645xxx -treated patients
versus those receiving standard care at month 12, a finding
that was statistically significant when patients receiving
concomitant benzodiazepine therapy were excluded from

the analysis.43 benzodiazepines are known to impair saccadic
eye movements. benefits of  xxxd2645xxx  therapy were also seen
on measures of swallowing capacity, auditory acuity and
ambulation. an overall mean improvement in hsem-alpha was
also seen in pediatric patients at month 12.43
adult and juvenile patients who completed the randomized phase of the study were eligible to continue treatment in
a 12-month, non-controlled extension phase. following this,
patients could enter a long-term ‘continued extension’ phase.
similarly, pediatric patients who completed the first 12 months
were eligible to continue treatment for a 12-month extension period followed by a long-term ‘continued extension’
phase. long-term data from the open-label extension phases
have also been reported.52 in all patients who had at least
one assessment during the continued extension phase (past
24 months, n = 14), swallowing capacity was improved in
more than 75% patients. median standard ambulation index
scores indicated stabilization.52 a disease stability analysis
of 19 adult or juvenile patients who completed at least
12 months of  xxxd2645xxx  therapy, based on four key parameters
of disease progression (hsem‑alpha, swallowing, ambulation and
cognition), showed that 68% had stable disease after treatment
(unpublished data wraith et al 2009).
in pediatric patients, the overall mean improvement in
hsem‑alpha velocity was maintained at month 24, and stabilization of ambulation and swallowing was also achieved.51 the
analysis of key parameters of disease progression revealed
that 80% of pediatric patients who entered the extension
phase had stable disease by month 24, suggesting that
 xxxd2645xxx  provided similar benefits in pediatric patients as in
juveniles and adults.51 these findings indicate that long-term
 xxxd2645xxx  therapy stabilizes neurological manifestations in
pediatric, juvenile and adult patients with np-c.
in addition to the prospective clinical trial, the effect
of  xxxd2645xxx  on the progression of neurological disease
in patients with np-c has been studied in an international, multicentre, observational cohort study. sixty-six
patients with np-c treated with  xxxd2645xxx  in clinical practice at 25 expert centers were assessed retrospectively53
using a modified disease-specific disability scale.32 the
scale analyzed four key parameters of neurological disease
progression in np-c: ambulation, manipulation, language and
swallowing. the mean annual progression was +0.11 score
units/year on the disability scale from diagnosis to treatment
start, indicating considerable disease progression prior to
initiation of  xxxd2645xxx  therapy. annual progression decreased
to −0.01 score units/year from treatment start to the last clinic
visit, indicating disease stabilization with  xxxd2645xxx  therapy.

previous epidemiological studies have established that npc tends to present in a range of different clinical forms
defined by patients’ age at onset of neurological symptoms:
early-infantile (onset 3 months to 2 years), late-infantile
(onset 2 to 6 years), juvenile (onset 6–15 years) and adult
(onset 15 years).20,32,33,54 when the patients in the retrospective  xxxd2645xxx  cohort were divided into three age groups, stabilization of neurological disease was observed in all groups.
however, the magnitude of the effect was greater in patients
diagnosed in late childhood (6–11 years) and in juveniles and
adults (12 years and older), compared with those diagnosed
in early childhood (younger than 6 years) (figure 2).
the efficacy of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with np-c has
also been demonstrated in a number of case series.41,55,56
in two taiwanese patients treated with  xxxd2645xxx  for one year,
cognitive improvement was observed in one patient and liver
and spleen volumes and  xxxg444xxx  levels were stabilized
in both patients.55 one patient had severe swallowing difficulties at baseline; this was greatly improved with  xxxd2645xxx 
treatment. the patient that showed improved cognition had
a later disease onset (late childhood) compared with the
second patient, whose presenting symptoms occurred in
infancy. a report of a brazilian patient with early childhood
onset np-c who received  xxxd2645xxx  for 12 months indicated
improvements in speech, ataxia, seizures, hypotonia, gaze

palsy and behavioral symptoms, and particularly ambulation.56
brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess
the effects of 24 months’  xxxd2645xxx  treatment in three patients
with np-c. a decrease in choline/creatine ratio was identified
as a potential marker for treatment efficacy, as a sustained
decrease correlated with mild improvement or stabilization of
clinical manifestations (swallowing, dysarthria, awareness or
ambulation) achieved with  xxxd2645xxx  therapy.41 the choline/
creatine ratio is a measure of membrane destruction, or gliosis,
so can be used as a marker for brain dysfunction.41 together,
these findings support data from the prospective clinical trial
and observational cohort study, indicating beneficial therapeutic effects of  xxxd2645xxx  in patients with np-c.

disease course, treatment should be commenced at or before
the anticipated time of neurological symptom onset. however,
patients with early-infantile onset np-c, and those with severe
dementia in the terminal stage of the disease, are less likely to
benefit from treatment with  xxxd2645xxx  and decisions to start
treatment should be made on a case by case basis. based on
these guidelines, a protocol for the initiation of  xxxd2645xxx 
treatment in np-c was developed (figure 3).
the recommended dose of 200 mg three times daily for
adult patients with np-c should be adjusted according to
body surface area for younger patients, as shown in table 1.3
in general  xxxd2645xxx  therapy should be continued as long as
patients continue to derive discernable therapeutic benefits with
an acceptable tolerability and safety profile. in early-infantile
onset disease it can take up to 6 to 12 months to see discernable
clinical benefits and 2 to 3 years in later-onset disease. given
the high variability of np-c in terms of symptomatology and
rate of progression, decisions to alter or discontinue treatment with  xxxd2645xxx  should be based on individual patient
characteristics, in consultation with the patient and their
family members. in cases where there is a perceived lack of
response, dose manipulation can be undertaken with careful
consideration of risk versus benefit and patient tolerability.3
a disease-specific registry to evaluate the long-term disease
course in patients with np-c, both untreated and treated with

 xxxd2645xxx , has been designed by an international scientific
committee57 and will be implemented in late 2009. one of the
objectives of this registry is to describe the natural history of
np-c and to evaluate the treatment experience of patients with
np-c, including the longitudinal assessment of outcomes. the
registry will employ the functional disability scale32 to assess
the progression of neurological disease. this first international registry for patients with np-c will provide important
further information on patient outcomes during  xxxd2645xxx 
therapy in real-world, clinical practice settings, and will bring
together information from a larger number of patients.

safety and tolerability
findings from the prospective clinical trial demonstrated
that  xxxd2645xxx  has a similar safety and tolerability profile in
pediatric and adult and juvenile patients with np-c to that
seen in patients with gd1.49,58,59 the most frequently reported
treatment-emergent adverse events with  xxxd2645xxx  therapy
were mild or moderate diarrhea, flatulence and weight loss
(table 2).43,51 the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events
and mild to moderate weight loss tended to decrease over time
on continued therapy. no deterioration of growth rates was
noted in pediatric or juvenile patients treated with  xxxd2645xxx .51
neurological adverse events such as tremor, headache and
fatigue were also commonly reported, but were generally

mild or moderate in intensity. although six juvenile or adult
patients and five pediatric patients experienced serious
adverse events during the full 24-month study period, none
of these events were considered related to  xxxd2645xxx  therapy.
withdrawals due to adverse events occurred in four adult or
juvenile patients and two pediatric patients. mild reductions
in platelet counts that were not associated with bleeding were
observed in some patients. continued monitoring of platelet
counts is recommended in patients who show a reduction that
is not associated with bleeding.47
when  xxxd2645xxx  was first launched in europe for the
treatment of gd1, a post-authorization surveillance program
was established. patients with np-c treated with  xxxd2645xxx  in
clinical practice are also included in the database.60 in march
2009, data had been collected from 102 patients with np-c
across 11 european countries.  xxxd2645xxx  was well-tolerated,
with a safety and tolerability profile matching that seen in
the clinical trials. over 60% of patients had received more
than 24 months’  xxxd2645xxx  therapy, and 38% had received
36 months’ treatment, demonstrating the long-term safety of
 xxxd2645xxx  in patients with np-c.60
there is some evidence to suggest that  xxxd2645xxx  may
have an effect on fertility. in animal studies, administration
of  xxxd2645xxx  to male mice resulted in reversible infertility in
some inbred mouse strains.61 in the same study normal male
fertility was reported in the rabbit. a pilot study of the effects
of  xxxd2645xxx  on spermatogenesis in healthy human men did not
detect any effect on sperm motility, morphology or concentration during 6 weeks of  xxxd2645xxx  therapy.61,62 however, further
data are required to confirm these findings; in the meantime
it is recommended that male patients should cease  xxxd2645xxx 
therapy before seeking to conceive, and maintain reliable
contraceptive methods.  xxxd2645xxx  may also have an effect
on fertility in women; for this reason  xxxd2645xxx  should not be
used during pregnancy or by breast-feeding women.47

patient and carer perspective
the prospective clinical trial of  xxxd2645xxx  in np-c did
not include any quality of life or patient satisfaction and

acceptability measures, so case reports are the main source
of data on the patient and caregiver perspective.  xxxd2645xxx 
has been shown to have a positive impact upon social
behavior, depression and affective and attention problems
in a brazilian patient with np-c,56 potentially leading to
improved quality of life, not only for the patient but also for
the patient’s family and carers. this was reflected in the case
study of two taiwanese patients, in which families of both
patients expressed satisfaction with  xxxd2645xxx  treatment.55
one of the patients also indicated satisfaction with treatment;
the second patient was not able to express his comments
despite improvements in communication during therapy.55
in our own clinic, we have a number of patients who have
achieved disease stabilization on  xxxd2645xxx  to the satisfaction
of both the patients and their parents.

conclusions
the eff icacy, safety and tolerability of  xxxd2645xxx  in
juvenile, adult and pediatric patients with np-c have been
demonstrated in a prospective clinical trial and a retrospective
observational study,43,51–53 supported by findings from
preclinical studies,44,48,50 case reports41,55,56 and the  xxxd2645xxx 
post-authorization surveillance program.60  xxxd2645xxx  may
stabilize the progression of neurological manifestations in
np-c, a significant achievement in this disease, for which
there has previously been no disease-modifying therapy
available. experts agree that stabilization of neurological
disease is the best attainable therapeutic goal in patients
diagnosed with np-c, due to the fact that irreversible damage
or loss of neurons will likely already have occurred by the
time the diagnosis of np-c is made.3 to date,  xxxd2645xxx  is the
only approved, disease-specific therapy for the treatment of
np-c. with the extension of  xxxd2645xxx ’s indication to include
the treatment of progressive neurological disease in adult and
pediatric patients with np-c, treatment can now be aimed at
stabilizing neurological disease progression. this represents
a significant step forward in the management and treatment
of this severely debilitating disorder.
