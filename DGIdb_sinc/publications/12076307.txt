abstract:  xxxd3398xxx  and its major active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-hm) are potent muscarinic receptor antagonists
that show selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands in vivo. this tissue selectivity cannot be attributed to
muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity, since both compounds are non-selective with respect to the m1– xxxg451xxx 
subtypes. the aim of the present in vitro study was to determine the specificity of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm for muscarinic
receptors compared to other potential cellular targets. carbachol-induced contractions of isolated guinea pig bladder were
effectively inhibited by  xxxd3398xxx  (ic50 14 nm) and 5-hm (ic50 5.7 nm).  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm were weak inhibitors
of effects mediated by a-adrenergic receptors (rat portal vein), histamine receptors (guinea pig ileum) and calcium channels
(guinea pig potassium-depolarised urinary bladder, spontaneously beating right atria and electrically-driven right papillary muscle). the ic50 values were in the mm range and the antimuscarinic potency of  xxxd3398xxx  was 27, 200 and 370–
485 times higher, respectively, than its potency in blocking histamine receptors, a-adrenoceptors and calcium channels.
the active metabolite, 5-hm, was ⬎900 times less potent at these sites than at bladder muscarinic receptors. radioligand
binding data on 54 different receptors and binding sites showed that  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm bind with significant affinity
only at muscarinic receptors. in conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that both  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm are
specific muscarinic receptor antagonists. the tissue selectivity of these agents in vivo cannot therefore be explained by
secondary pharmacological actions.

overactive (unstable) bladder is characterised by uncontrolled contractions of the detrusor muscle during the filling
phase of the micturition cycle, resulting in symptoms of increased micturition frequency and urgency, with or without
urge incontinence. contractions of the human detrusor are
considered to be predominantly mediated by cholinergic
muscarinic receptors (andersson 1993). antimuscarinic
drugs are therefore widely used in the treatment of bladder
overactivity, but the clinical utility of older drugs (e.g. oxybutynin) is limited by their classical antimuscarinic side-effects, e.g. bothersome dry mouth (andersson et al. 1999).
indeed, antimuscarinic side-effects often result in discontinuation of drug treatment (yarker et al. 1995; kelleher et
al. 1997).
 xxxd3398xxx  (fig. 1) is the first muscarinic receptor antagonist to be specifically developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. data from studies in healthy volunteers
show that the effect of  xxxd3398xxx  on the bladder is rapid
in onset and long lasting, whereas the effect on salivation is
transient and only apparent around the time of peak serum
levels (stahl et al. 1995; brynne et al. 1997). moreover, results from comparative clinical studies in patients with overactive bladder show that  xxxd3398xxx  (2 mg twice daily) is as
effective as oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) with regard
to bladder symptoms, but with markedly improved toleraauthor for correspondence: lisbeth nilvebrant, nilvebrant pharma consulting ab, lillsjönäsvägen 11, se-167 32 bromma,

bility and a significantly lower incidence of dry mouth (appell 1997; abrams et al. 1998; drutz et al. 1999; malonelee 2000). this observation was recently confirmed in a
comparative study of the once-daily formulations of  xxxd3398xxx  and oxybutynin (ditropana xl) (chapple 2001).
thus, the clinical results with  xxxd3398xxx  have confirmed
the early pharmacological observations in the anaesthetised
cat, i.e. that  xxxd3398xxx  exhibits a favourable selectivity for
the bladder over salivary glands in vivo whereas oxybutynin
has a significantly more pronounced effect on the salivary
glands than on the bladder (nilvebrant et al. 1997a).
in man and several animal species,  xxxd3398xxx  is extensively metabolised (primarily by oxidation mediated by
 xxxg588xxx  in the liver) (postlind et al. 1998) to
the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, 5-hm (labcode dd 01;
pnu 200577) (fig. 1) that is pharmacologically active (nilvebrant et al. 1997b). based on pharmacological and
pharmacokinetic data, it has been concluded that 5-hm

pharmacological specificity of  xxxd3398xxx 

contributes to the therapeutic effect of  xxxd3398xxx  (nilvebrant et al. 1997b & c; larsson et al. 1999). the degree of
serum protein binding differs between  xxxd3398xxx  and 5hm, with the unbound concentration of 5-hm being ten
times higher than that of  xxxd3398xxx  in human serum
(påhlman & gozzi 1999). the antimuscarinic profile of 5hm is almost identical to that of  xxxd3398xxx  with regard to
both in vitro potency and in vivo tissue selectivity (nilvebrant et al. 1997b). however, both  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm
are non-selective with respect to the five muscarinic receptor
subtypes, m1–m5 (nilvebrant et al. 1997 a & b). the functional tissue selectivity observed in vivo, in both animals and
patients cannot therefore be attributed to selectivity of  xxxd3398xxx  or 5-hm for a specific muscarinic receptor subtype.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the pharmacological specificity of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm for muscarinic receptors, as compared to a variety of other sites,
to determine whether some secondary action (e.g. calcium
channel blockade) might contribute to the selectivity for the
bladder observed in vivo. the methods used comprised
functional in vitro studies in isolated tissues and radioligand
binding studies of 54 different receptors and binding sites.
for purposes of comparison, atropine and oxybutynin were
included as reference compounds in the functional studies.
atropine served as the classical standard ‘pure’ antimuscarinic agent, while oxybutynin was included because it has
been classified as having a mixed mechanism of action on
smooth muscle (andersson 1988; andersson et al. 1999).
preliminary reports of some of the functional data have previously been presented in abstract form (nilvebrant et al.
1994; gillberg et al. 1996; nilvebrant 1997).
materials and methods
functional in vitro studies in isolated tissues. the antagonist activities of  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm, oxybutynin and atropine were determined at muscarinic (versus carbachol), a-adrenergic (versus noradrenaline) and histamine (versus histamine) receptors in the guinea
pig isolated urinary bladder, rat isolated portal vein and guinea
pig isolated ileum, respectively. potential calcium channel-blocking
activity was studied in the guinea pig bladder (potassium depolarised), spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven papillary muscle from the right ventricle. the choice of tissue preparations was based on the superficial structural similarity between  xxxd3398xxx  and terodiline (nilvebrant 1997 & 2000). terodiline is a
weak antimuscarinic drug with low pharmacological specificity
since it blocks not only muscarinic receptors but also calcium channels (at similar concentrations as required for blockade of muscarinic receptors), a-adrenoceptors and histamine receptors (nilvebrant 1997 & 2000).
pilot studies were carried out to validate the experimental conditions for each tissue preparation. thus, to determine a suitable
concentration and interval for challenge with the agonist in the
standard experiments described below, a series of concentrationresponse curves were made with all agonists used. great care was
taken to establish the time to reach equilibrium with the antagonists
in the tissue baths, and at least one reference antagonist was included as positive control for validation purposes (i.e.  xxxd2914xxx 
for a-adrenoceptors, promethazine for histamine receptors, and
verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem for calcium channel-blocking
effects).

muscarinic receptor antagonists increase heart rate. however,
preliminary experiments on spontaneously beating right atria indicated that high concentrations were required to demonstrate a negative inotropic effect of the antimuscarinic agents. under these conditions, the effect on contractile force was more pronounced than
the effect on frequency of contractions. the concentration-effect
curves for the negative inotropic effect were steep and determinations of frequency became unreliable due to the small amplitude
of the contractile response at high concentrations. it was therefore
decided to focus on the negative inotropic effect in this preparation.
experimental procedure. male guinea pigs (dunkin hartley strain,
weighing about 300 g) and male rats (sprague dawley strain,
weighing about 200 g) were killed by a blow to the neck and exsanguinated. the required tissues were quickly removed, placed in
krebs-henseleit solution [composition (mm): nacl (119), kcl
(4.6), cacl2 (1.5), mgcl2 (1.2), nah2po4 (1.2), nahco3 (20) and
glucose (11); ph 7.4] and dissected for immediate use. guinea pig
urinary bladders were cleansed of adherent fat and connective
tissue, before being opened along the longitudinal axis on each side.
mucosal tissue was gently removed, and four muscle strips (3–5
mm¿10–13 mm) were prepared. guinea pig ileum was relaxed in
temperate (37 æ) krebs-henseleit solution, gently washed and dissected free from adherent mesenteric tissue, before sections of 1.5–
2 cm in length were prepared. the entire ileal wall was used, i.e.
the circular and longitudinal muscle layers were not separated. for
preparation of guinea pig cardiac tissues (the right atria and papillary muscle from the right ventricle), hearts were placed in temperate (35 æ) krebs-henseleit solution, continuously aerated with 93.5%
o2/6.5% co2 to avoid anoxia. rat portal vein was cleansed of fat
and adherent connective tissue before being opened by a longitudinal incision. each vein was divided into two strip preparations, 7–
10 mm long.
dissected tissues were transferred to 5 ml jacketed tissue baths
(10 ml for cardiac preparations) and mounted vertically between
two hooks and connected to a force transducer (ft 03, grass instruments). the baths contained temperature-controlled (37 æ; cardiac preparations, 35 æ) krebs-henseleit solution, continuously aerated with 93.5% o2/6.5% co2 to maintain ph 7.4. for experiments
on the urinary bladder involving the response to potassium depolarisation, the nacl in the krebs-henseleit solution was replaced by
kcl. isometric tension was recorded by a polygraph (model 7 d or
79 d, grass instruments). a resting tension of 5 mn (atria 10 mn)
was initially applied to each preparation. during stabilisation (approximately 45 min.; at least 60 min. for cardiac tissues), the preparations were repeatedly washed and the resting tension adjusted.
each non-cardiac preparation was exposed to a standard submaximal concentration of agonist at fixed intervals (guinea pig urinary bladder: 3 mm carbachol [ec80] or 127 mm potassium [ec95],
at 15–20 min. intervals; guinea pig ileum: 0.5 mm histamine [ec80]
at 2–4 min. intervals; rat portal vein: 1 mm noradrenaline [ec60] at
15–20 min. intervals) until a reproducible contractile response was
observed (æ10% variation in amplitude). after appropriate exposure of the preparations to antagonist (incubation times of 10
and 60 min., respectively, for guinea pig ileum and urinary bladder;
15 min. for rat portal vein), the contractile response to the agonist
was again recorded, in the presence of the antagonist.
for guinea pig right papillary muscle, the ventricular end was
fixed in the organ bath while the chordal end was connected to the
force transducer. following stabilisation, electrical field stimulation
was delivered via two platinum electrodes from a grass s88 stimulator as square-wave pulses with duration of 2 msec. at supra-maximal voltage (15 v). the frequency interval was 1 hz. for both cardiac preparations, cumulative concentration-effect curves (negative
inotropic effect) were generated by stepwise addition of the antagonist at intervals of at least 30 min. at least six concentrations of
antagonist were evaluated in each experiment to generate concentration-inhibition curves. only one concentration of antagonist was
used in each individual tissue preparation. drug effects were calcu-

required to cause 50% inhibition of the control response) were determined graphically from concentration-inhibition curves.
radioligand binding studies. the affinities of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm
at 54 different receptors and binding sites, including a-adrenergic
and histamine receptors, as well as calcium channels, were investigated according to standard radioligand binding procedures (cerep,
celle l’evescault, france). in brief, all assays were performed in
triplicate, using a fixed concentration (1 mm) of either  xxxd3398xxx 
or 5-hm as competing unlabelled ligand. in each experiment, an
appropriate reference compound for the receptor (or binding site)
under investigation was simultaneously tested at eight concentrations (duplicate samples) to obtain a complete competition curve
for validation of the assay.  xxxd3398xxx  or 5-hm were to be subjected to a second experiment only if the first assay (at 1 mm) resulted in ⬎50% displacement of the receptor specific binding of the
radioligand. in these instances,  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm were to be
tested at ten different concentrations (duplicate samples) to generate full competition curves for determination of the dissociation
constant (ki).
following incubation with the appropriate radioligand, membrane suspension and unlabelled drug, binding assays were terminated by rapid filtration under vacuum through gf/b or gf/c glass
fibre filters (whatman or packard) followed by several washings
with ice-cold buffer, using a brandel or packard cell harvester.
bound radioactivity was measured by means of liquid scintillation
counting. hill coefficients (nh) and ic50 values were determined by
non-linear regression analysis of the competition binding curves.
ki values were calculated according to the cheng-prusoff equation
(cheng & prusoff 1973).
drugs and chemicals. the following agonists and antagonists were
used in the functional in vitro studies: carbachol (carbamylcholine
chloride), noradrenaline hydrochloride, histamine dihydrochloride,
 xxxd247xxx , oxybutynin hydrochloride,  xxxd2914xxx  methanesulphonate, promethazine hydrochloride, nifedipine, verapamil
hydrochloride, diltiazem hydrochloride and  xxxd2398xxx  [(ª)- xxxd2401xxx  (pi)-bitartrate). these compounds were all purchased
from the sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa.  xxxd3398xxx 
[(r)-n, n-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)- xxxd1061xxx ] and 5-hm [(r)-n, n-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethylphenyl)- xxxd1061xxx ] were synthesised by
pharmacia corporation, sweden. all other chemicals used were of
analytical grade and purchased from general commercial sources.

results
functional in vitro studies.
 xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm effectively inhibited carbachol-induced contractions of the guinea pig isolated urinary blad-

der, with ic50 values (14 and 5.7 nm, respectively) that were
similar to those determined for oxybutynin (17 nm) and
atropine (7.2 nm) (table 1).  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm, oxybutynin
and atropine also inhibited the contractile responses to histamine in the guinea pig isolated ileum and to noradrenaline in the rat isolated portal vein, in a concentration-dependent manner. however, the ic50 values for these effects
were in the mm range (table 1).  xxxd3398xxx , which was the
most potent of the antimuscarinic compounds tested in
these tissues, was about 170 times less potent than the reference antagonists promethazine and  xxxd2914xxx  (table 1).
the potency of  xxxd3398xxx  at bladder muscarinic receptors
was 27 and 200 times higher, respectively, than its potency
at histamine and a-adrenergic receptors.  xxxd3398xxx ’s
major metabolite, 5-hm, was about 1000 and 17 500 times
less potent at these sites, respectively, than at bladder muscarinic receptors. in fact, both oxybutynin and atropine
were more potent than 5-hm at histamine and a-adrenergic
receptors (table 1).
 xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm, oxybutynin and atropine blocked calcium channels in the guinea pig isolated bladder, and all
compounds produced a concentration-dependent negative
inotropic effect in the spontaneously beating right atria and
the electrically paced papillary muscle (table 2). the negative inotropic effect in the cardiac preparations could be
readily reversed by the addition of calcium ions (0.5–3 mm)
or  xxxd2398xxx  (100 nm) (data not shown). these findings
support the assumption that the effects of the antimuscarinic agents were due to blockade of calcium channels
(fleckenstein 1977; cavero & spedding 1983). the rank order of potency found in the cardiac preparations for the
calcium antagonists included as positive controls (nifedipine
ø verapamil ⰷ diltiazem) was in agreement with previous
reports on cardiac preparations from different species
(granger et al. 1985; nakaya et al. 1988; polster et al. 1990;
schwinger et al. 1990). the calcium channel-blocking activity of  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm, oxybutynin and atropine was
weak. thus, with ic50 values of ⬎5 mm,  xxxd3398xxx  (fig. 2
and table 2) and oxybutynin were about 370–485 and 350–
650 times less potent, respectively, at calcium channels than
at bladder muscarinic receptors (table 2). similarly, 5-hm
was ⬎900 times less potent in these preparations than at
muscarinic receptors (fig. 2 and table 2).

ic50 values for calcium antagonist activity in the urinary bladder were derived from concentration-inhibition curves generated versus a fixed

radioligand binding studies.
in line with the functional studies, a-adrenergic receptors,
calcium channels and histamine receptors were included in
the panel of 54 different targets studied in this broad radioligand binding screening of pharmacological specificity. except for these sites, data are presented only for assays in
which  xxxd3398xxx  (1 mm) produced at least 50% inhibition
of the receptor specific radioligand binding.
the affinity of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm at muscarinic receptors was determined in the rat cerebral cortex, using
[3h](ª) l-quinuclidinyl benzilate as radioligand (richards
1990). as expected, both  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm (1 mm) produced 100% displacement of the receptor specific binding
of the radioligand. the ki values derived from full competition curves with  xxxd3398xxx  (0.34 nm) and 5-hm (0.24
nm) (table 3) were in fair agreement with those previously
reported for the guinea pig cerebral cortex ( xxxd3398xxx , 0.75
nm; 5-hm, 0.60 nm) (nilvebrant et al. 1997a & b).
the potential affinity of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm at a1- and
a2-adrenergic receptors was assessed using [3h]- xxxd3000xxx 

(greengrass & bremner 1979) and [3h]-rx821002 (uhlén &
wikberg 1991), respectively, as radioligands.  xxxd3398xxx  and
5-hm (1 mm) inhibited the specific binding of these radioligands by 0–5%. the affinity at calcium channels was investigated in the rat cerebral cortex versus [3h]-pn200–110 (lchannel, dihydropyridine site; lee et al. 1984) and [125i]omega-conotoxin gvia (n-channel; wagner et al. 1988).
the inhibition produced by  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm (1 mm) at
these sites was 0–2%. full competition curves were therefore
not generated for a-adrenoceptors or calcium channels.
binding to histamine h1 and h2 receptors was evaluated
in the guinea pig cerebellum (versus [3h]- xxxd3050xxx ; dini
et al. 1991) and in the guinea pig striatum (versus [125i]apt; ruat et al. 1990).  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm (1 mm) had
no affinity at h2 receptors, since the inhibition of the specific radioligand binding amounted to ⬍7% (no further experiments were therefore carried out). however,  xxxd3398xxx 
and 5-hm (1 mm) inhibited the specific binding of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  by 78% and 32%, respectively. although the inhibition produced by 5-hm was ⬍50%, both compounds
were subjected to a second set of experiments to generate

activity was determined in the potassium-depolarised bladder (s), spontaneously beating right atrium (ò) and electrically paced papillary

ki values were derived from competition experiments, using the radioligands [3h](ª)-l-quinuclidinyl benzilate (muscarinic receptors, rat
cerebral cortex), [3h]-(pi)-pentazocine (sigma-1 receptors, guinea pig cerebral cortex) and [3h]- xxxd3050xxx  (histamine h1 receptors, guinea
pig cerebellum).  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm were studied at ten different concentrations (duplicate samples) to generate full competition curves.
the reference antagonists were studied at eight concentrations (duplicate samples). two sets of data are shown for the reference antagonists
(i.e. atropine,  xxxd3050xxx  and haloperidol), the first value pertains to the control run with the  xxxd3398xxx  experiment and the second to that

full competition curves. the ki values revealed that the affinity of  xxxd3398xxx  at histamine h1 receptors was 500 times
lower than at muscarinic receptors in rat cerebral cortex.
the corresponding specificity ratio for 5-hm at h1 receptors was about 4000 (fig. 3 and table 3).
in the initial screening,  xxxd3398xxx  was also found to exhibit some affinity at the sigma-1 site, as determined in the
guinea pig cerebral cortex using [3h]-(pi)-pentazocine as
radioligand (bowen et al. 1993). thus,  xxxd3398xxx  (1 mm)
inhibited 78% of [3h]-(pi)-pentazocine binding. although
the same concentration of 5-hm only produced 18% inhibition of radioligand binding, full displacement studies were
carried out for both agents. as shown by the ki value, the
affinity of  xxxd3398xxx  was about 1000 times lower at the
sigma-1 site than at muscarinic receptors in the rat cerebral
cortex (fig. 3 and table 3). for 5-hm, the difference in affinity was more than 10 000-fold (fig. 3 and table 3).
except for muscarinic receptors and the initial results
for the  xxxg1078xxx  and the sigma-1 site,  xxxd3398xxx  showed no significant inhibitory effect or binding to
any of the other receptors and binding sites included in
this broad screening for pharmacological specificity.  xxxd3398xxx ’s major metabolite, 5-hm (1 mm), produced

⬎50% inhibition of specific radioligand binding only at
muscarinic receptors.

discussion
 xxxd3398xxx  and its major pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-hm, are potent and competitive muscarinic receptor
antagonists that show a selectivity for the urinary bladder
over salivary glands in vivo, both in animals and in patients
with an overactive bladder (appell 1997; nilvebrant et al.
1997a & b; abrams et al. 1998; drutz et al. 1999; malonelee 2000; nilvebrant 2000 & 2001). this tissue selectivity
cannot be explained by selectivity for a specific muscarinic
receptor subtype, since both compounds are non-selective
with regard to the five muscarinic (m1–m5) receptor subtypes (nilvebrant et al. 1997a & b). the present in vitro
study was undertaken to investigate the pharmacological
specificity of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm for cholinergic muscarinic receptors, as compared to a variety of other cellular
targets, to evaluate whether some secondary action (e.g. calcium channel blockade) might contribute to the selectivity

histamine h1 (ò) and sigma-1 (ô) receptors determined in radioligand binding studies.

pharmacological specificity of  xxxd3398xxx 

macological actions are important to consider also from a
safety perspective.
 xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm, oxybutynin and atropine effectively
inhibited carbachol-induced contractions of the guinea pig
isolated bladder with ic50 values in the nm range. in
agreement with previously reported data from functional
and radioligand binding studies on guinea pig and human
bladder (naerger et al. 1995; nilvebrant et al. 1997a; yono
et al. 1999),  xxxd3398xxx  (ic50 14 nm) was equipotent to
oxybutynin (ic50 17 nm). however, 5-hm was somewhat
more potent than  xxxd3398xxx  in this study (ic50 5.7 nm).
this phenomenon has also been observed for the kb
values determined versus carbachol in the guinea pig bladder ( xxxd3398xxx , 3.0 nm; 5-hm, 0.84 nm) (nilvebrant et
al. 1997a & b). there is no explanation as to the apparent
difference in antimuscarinic potency between  xxxd3398xxx 
and 5-hm in functional studies on the guinea pig isolated
bladder. radioligand binding data clearly show that  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm bind with almost identical affinities to
the muscarinic receptors both in the guinea pig bladder
and in other tissues from this species, as well as to the
five human m1–m5 receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells (nilvebrant et al. 1997a & b). similarly,
the radioligand binding data in the present study showed
no difference between the affinities of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5hm at the muscarinic receptors in the rat cerebral cortex.
in addition, functional data on the human bladder show
that  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm are equipotent with pa2 values
of 9.04 (yono et al. 1999).
the four antimuscarinic compounds evaluated in the
present study were able to inhibit both histamine-induced
contractions of the guinea pig isolated ileum and noradrenaline-induced contractions of the rat isolated portal vein
(rank order of potency:  xxxd3398xxx  ⬎ atropine ⬎ oxybutynin ⬎ 5-hm). however, the antimuscarinics were weak antagonists in these preparations, with ic50 values in the mm
range. the radioligand binding screening confirmed that
neither  xxxd3398xxx  nor 5-hm had any significant affinity
at a-adrenoceptors (a1 and a2) or histamine h2 receptors.
although  xxxd3398xxx  inhibited 78% of the specific binding
of [3h]- xxxd3050xxx  to histamine h1 receptors in the guinea
pig cerebellum, the affinity of  xxxd3398xxx  for the h1 receptors was 500 times lower than its affinity at muscarinic receptors in the rat cerebral cortex. as shown by the data in
fig. 3, the concentrations of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm needed
to significantly affect histamine h1 receptors were much
higher than those required to saturate the muscarinic receptors in the rat cerebral cortex.
a calcium channel-blocking activity could be demonstrated for  xxxd3398xxx , 5-hm, oxybutynin and atropine in
the potassium-depolarised guinea pig isolated urinary bladder, the spontaneously beating right atria (rank order of
potency in these preparations:  xxxd3398xxx  ⬎ oxybutynin ⬎
5-hm ⬎ atropine) and in electrically driven papillary
muscles from the right ventricle (rank order of potency: 5hm ∑ oxybutynin ∑  xxxd3398xxx  ⬎ atropine). however, the
antimuscarinics were weak also as calcium channel block-

265

ers, with ic50 values in the mm range.  xxxd3398xxx , which
was the most potent among the antimuscarinics tested, had
ic50 values of 5.2–6.8 mm in the three preparations studied.
thus, a 100% inhibition of carbachol-induced contraction
of the isolated bladder was achieved at concentrations of
 xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm that had no effect at calcium channels in the bladder or the cardiac preparations (see fig. 2).
the radioligand binding studies on  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm
included two calcium channel assays. the results showed
that even at the high concentration used (i.e. 1 mm),  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm had no effect at l- or n-channels. the
potent inhibitory actions of these compounds on bladder
tissue cannot therefore be attributed to a mixed action with
combined blockade of muscarinic receptors and calcium
channels in smooth muscles. similar observations have previously been reported for oxybutynin (kachur et al. 1988;
smith et al. 1998; kaneko et al. 1999). moreover, it has also
been shown that the effect of oxybutynin on the bladder
in vivo significantly correlates only with its antimuscarinic
activity (noronha-blob & kachur 1991).
overall, the results of the present study clearly indicate
that  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm are pure muscarinic receptor
antagonists and that the in vivo selectivity for the bladder
over salivary glands probably cannot be explained by any
secondary effect on smooth muscle. for example, the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm on calcium channels in the functional in vitro studies could be demonstrated
only at high concentrations (mm) that are of no pharmacological or therapeutic relevance. thus, the recommended
dose of  xxxd3398xxx  (2 mg twice daily) results in unbound
serum concentrations ( xxxd3398xxx  pi 5-hm) in the nm
range, i.e. close to the ki values determined for  xxxd3398xxx 
(2.7 nm) and 5-hm (2.9 nm) at bladder muscarinic receptors (larsson et al. 1999).
potential secondary pharmacological actions of drugs are
important also from a safety point of view, both for the
parent compound and for any active metabolite, particularly if the unbound concentration of the metabolite in
serum is higher than that of the parent compound. active
metabolites are common among the drugs that are currently
used for the treatment of urge incontinence and overactive
bladder. however, except for primary action(s), the pharmacological profile of active metabolites of commonly used
drugs seem not to have been investigated in great detail.
thus, a major metabolite of oxybutynin, n-desethyloxybutynin, is pharmacologically active. the serum concentration
of this metabolite is 2–5 times higher, and persists longer,
than the levels of oxybutynin itself (hughes et al. 1992).
moreover, n-desethyloxybutynin is at least as potent as oxybutynin with regard to antimuscarinic potency and shows
an even greater selectivity than the parent compound for
m1 and m3 over m2 receptors (nilvebrant et al. 1989; waldeck et al. 1997). it has therefore been suggested that both
the therapeutic effect and side effects of oxybutynin may be
largely due to this metabolite (waldeck et al. 1997; smith
et al. 1998; andersson et al. 1999). on the other hand, ndesethyloxybutynin seems not to have been subjected to de-

266

tailed investigations on potential secondary pharmacological actions.
propiverine is another drug that is used in the treatment
of urge incontinence and which has several active metabolites. pharmacologically, propiverine is a weak antimuscarinic drug that also exerts calcium channel-blocking activity
within the same concentration range (tokuno et al. 1993;
kaneko et al. 1999). however, more than 15 metabolites
of propiverine have been identified, four of which have an
antimuscarinic activity that is equal to, or greater than, that
of the parent compound (haustein & hüller 1988; müller
et al. 1993). both the plasma concentrations and half-lives
of these metabolites exceed those of propiverine (siegmund
et al. 1990). thus, the clinical effect of propiverine may be
due to the antimuscarinic properties of its metabolites.
however, scientific data that illuminates the role of propiverine versus active metabolites, with regard to efficacy and
safety, are not presently available in the literature.
terodiline is another drug that previously was widely
used for the treatment of urge incontinence and overactive
bladder. however, terodiline was withdrawn from the market because of a suspected association with severe cardiac
arrhythmias (andrews & bevan 1991; conolly et al. 1991;
mcleod et al. 1991; stewart et al. 1992). terodiline is a
weak antimuscarinic drug that has a low degree of pharmacological specificity. it has, for example, been shown that
terodiline blocks calcium channels in the heart at concentrations that are lower than those required for an efficient
blockade of the muscarinic receptors in the bladder (nilvebrant 1997). as mentioned earlier,  xxxd3398xxx  shows a
superficial 2-dimensional structural similarity to terodiline.
however,  xxxd3398xxx  and terodiline are distinct chemical
entities. thus, the 3-dimensional structures of these drugs
show that they do not occupy the same volume in space
and have different electronic properties (nilvebrant 1997 &
2000). therefore, it is not surprising that  xxxd3398xxx  and
terodiline exhibit distinct pharmacological profiles (nilvebrant 1997 & 2000).
in conclusion, the results of the present study show that
both  xxxd3398xxx  and its major active metabolite, 5-hm, appear to be pure muscarinic receptor antagonists since no
significant affinity was observed at any of the other receptors or binding sites studied. the present results do not explain the tissue selectivity exhibited by  xxxd3398xxx  and 5hm for the bladder in vivo. however, from a safety point
of view, it is important that both  xxxd3398xxx  and its major
active metabolite, 5-hm, showed a high degree of specificity
for muscarinic receptors as compared to other sites. these
in vitro results are, in fact, in agreement with the side-effect
profile that has been reported from clinical studies with  xxxd3398xxx . thus, there have been no safety concerns, with the
general side-effect profile reflecting the pure antimuscarinic
nature of both  xxxd3398xxx  and 5-hm. thus, the most common side effect is dry mouth, as could expected for any
antimuscarinic drug. however, both the incidence and the
severity of dry mouth are significantly lower during treatment with  xxxd3398xxx  than with oxybutynin (appell 1997;

abrams et al. 1998; drutz et al. 1999; malone-lee 2000;
nilvebrant 2001).
