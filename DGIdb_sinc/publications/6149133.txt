 xxxd3096xxx , a new potential antipsychotic compound with selective anti-dopaminergic actions in the rat brain, european j.
pharmacol. 102 (1984) 459-474.
the novel substituted benzamide,  xxxd3096xxx , preferentially blocked apomorphine-induced hyperactivity with
weak effects on stereotypies. the potency of  xxxd3096xxx  was about 50 times higher than that of sulpiride.
 xxxd3096xxx  caused a weak, atypical form of catalepsy and showed a high separation between the eds0 for blockade
of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity and the eds0 for induction of catalepsy (ratio 24).  xxxd3096xxx  was shown to
be a selective dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist since it displaced [3h]spiperone (ic50=1570 rim) but not
[ 3h] xxxd2137xxx  (ic50 > 100 000 nm) in rat striatum, and did not inhibit striatal da-sensitive adenylate cyclase in vitro
(ic50 > 100 000 nm).  xxxd3096xxx  is a potent antagonist of d 2 receptors showing a dose-dependent blockade of
[ 3h]spiperone and [a h]n-propylnorapomorphine in vivo binding with a potency equal to that of chlorpromazine. in
contrast to haloperidol,  xxxd3096xxx  caused a preferential blockade of in vivo [ 3h]spiperone binding in the mesolimbic
da rich areas and the substantia nigra with much less effect in the striatum. in addition,  xxxd3096xxx  produced a
preferential increase of da utilization following synthesis inhibition in the olfactory tubercle. only minor changes in
na and 5-ht metabolism were observed while hva and dopac levels were markedly elevated. taken together,
these results indicate that  xxxd3096xxx  is a potent, selective d 2 receptor blocking agent with a preferential action in
mesolimbic and extrastriatal dopamine-containing neurons.

1. introduction
the antipsychotic effect, extrapyramidal disturbances (eg. parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesias)
and neuroendocrine side-effects of neuroleptic
drugs have been associated with the blockade of
dopamine (da) receptors in mesolimbic, striatal
and hypothalamic brain regions, respectively (iversen, 1975; gudelsky and moore, 1976). in recent
years considerable attention has been devoted to
the possibility of selectively manipulating functional activity in the different d a systems (fuxe
et al., 1977). there are several reports of a prefer* to whom all correspondenceshould be addressed.

hyperactivity

stereotypies

ential blockade by some neuroleptics of da receptors in the limbic forebrain, an area considered
important for the antipsychotic action of neuroleptic drugs (stevens, 1973; bunney and
aghajanian, 1974). two types of postsynaptic da
receptors have been identified by biochemical
studies in the rat striatum; one of which is linked
to an adenylate cyclase (d1) and one not linked to
this cyclase (d2) (garau et al., 1978; kebabian
and calne, 1979). in addition, several types of da
receptors have been proposed based on results
obtained with receptor ligand studies (sokoloff et
al., 1980; seeman, 1980). thus, the existence of
subgroups of d a receptors in the brain and the
observation that neuroleptic drugs have different

460

affinities for different da receptors (seeman, 1980)
offers the possibility of developing drugs that act
selectively on certain types of da receptors. selective da receptor antagonists would improve the
present treatment of psychotic disorders and reduce the frequency of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side-effects.
in the search for selective da antagonists, it
was recently demonstrated that a series of novel
n-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-dialkoxybenzamides exhibited properties in the rat suggesting blockade of central da receptors. several
compounds in this series were considerably more
potent than sulpiride as da receptor antagonists
as evidenced by their ability to block the behavioural effects of the da agonist apomorphine
(florvall and 0gren, 1982; florvall et al., 1983).
the blockade of da receptor activity in vivo was
mainly confined to the levorotatory isomers having the s absolute configuration.
one of these compounds,  xxxd3096xxx  (fla
7 3 1 ( - ) , (s)-(-)-3-bromo-2,6-dimethoxy-n-[(1ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-benzamide) (fig. 1)
was found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of
central da receptors. thus, it preferentially
blocked apomorphine-induced hyperactivity with
a potency three times less than that of haloperidol
(florvall and 0gren, 1982). in the present paper
the action of  xxxd3096xxx  on central da receptor
mechanisms has been further characterized. in view
of the importance of understanding the mechanism of action of different types of neuroleptic
drugs, the effects of chlorpromazine, haloperidol,
 xxxd3096xxx , sulpiride and thioridazine were
analyzed in detail, combining results from
histochemical, biochemical and behavioural observations in the rat.

and 60 min after the apomorphine injection. the
compounds were injected i.p. 60 rain prior to
apomorphine hydrochloride (1.0 m g / k g dissolved
in saline) injected s.c. into the neck. after the
injection of apomorphine the animals were placed
in individual observation cages and observed for
60 min. the stereotypies were scored according to
a modified version (0gren et al., 1978) of the
scoring system introduced by costall and naylor
(1973). the intensity of the stereotypies was scored
using a 0-3 rating scale:
score

description of stereotyped behavior
no sniffing
discontinuous sniffing
continuous sniffing
continuous sniffing combined with
chewing, biting and licking

in addition, the number of animals displaying
apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was scored at
the same time periods as the stereotypies. a hyperactive state was defined as a forward movement
covering a distance of at least 10 cm within 30 s.

2.2. measurement of catalepsy
male sprague-dawley rats (275-325 g) were
used. each dose level was tested in 8 animals in
open macrolon ® cages fitted with a 7 cm high
horizontal bar. catalepsy was measured 1, 2, 4, 8
and 24 h after injection of the test compound. the
forelimbs of each animal were gently placed on the
horizontal bar and a cataleptic state was scored if
the rat failed to remove itself from the bar within
60 s.

2.3. blockade of apomorphine-induced emesis in dogs
2. materials and methods

2.1. blockade of apomorphine-induced stereotypies
and hyperactivity in rats
male sprague-dawley rats (275-325 g) were
used. the rats were observed in macrolon® cages
(length 40 cm x width 25 cm x height 39 cm), and
the behavioural responses were scored 5, 20, 40

male and female beagle dogs weighing 8.5-17.5
kg were housed in individual cages and fed com-

mercial dog food (pris ®, ewos, sweden) and tap
water. eight animals were studied simultaneously.
written records of the results were kept throughout
the study by the same observer. initial tests on the
emetic response to 50 #g/kg of apomorphine were
made to obtain baseline values. if the animal did
not respond to this dose of apomorphine it was
excluded from the study. the dose was low, in
order to avoid unnecessary strain on the animals
but sufficiently high to give reproducible results
between tests on the same animal, as seen from the
consistency in the responses to apomorphine between the pretreatment control test (mean 7.5
vomitings) and the post-treatment control test
(mean 7.5 vomitings) five months later.
the apomorphine test was repeated at intervals
of at least five days in order to avoid habituation
to the effects in the animals. the animals were
pretreated orally with  xxxd3096xxx , sulpiride or
haloperidol 1, 4, 8 or 16 h before the apomorphine
test. the doses tested ranged from 0.05 to 5
/~mol/kg. three animals were tested at each dose
level. the number of vomitings at each test was
recorded. the effects of pretreatments were calculated as percent protection compared to the mean
of the two control determinations for each dog.

2.4. in vitro receptor binding and adenylate cyclase
assays
studies on the [3h]spiperone binding to homogenates prepared from the rat striatum were performed as described previously (hall and ogren,
1981). [3h] xxxd2137xxx  binding was also determined in striatal homogenates while [3h]wb4101 binding was determined in cortical homogenates. male sprague-dawley rats (150-200 g)
were decapitated and the brain tissues quickly
removed and put on ice. striata from 4 or more
rats were pooled and homogenized using a sonifier
(branson b30). the homogenate was centrifuged
at 48000 x g for 10 rain, and the pellet was homogenized and centrifuged a second time. the
pellet was resuspended to a final concentration of
5 mg wet weight/ml in tris hc1 buffer (ph 7.4;
0.05 m) containing electrolytes and the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2850xxx . ( + )-butaclamol
(1 #m) was used to determine non-specific binding

in [3h]spiperone and [3h] xxxd2137xxx  binding experiments. in order to exclude dopamine d 2 receptors and obtain specific binding to dopamine d,
receptors only,  xxxd1927xxx  (100 nm) was added
to the assay tubes for [3h] xxxd2137xxx  binding.
the incubations (10 min at 37 o c) were carried out
in plastic trays suitable for filtration with cell
harvester equipment (hall and thor, 1979). the
radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (mark iii, nuclear chicago inc.).
the potencies of the compound to inhibit
dopamine adenylate cyclase were determined using
a method modified from that of kebabian et al.
(1972). striatal homogenate, dopamine (10 /xm)
and the antagonist were preincubated for 18.5 min
at + 4 ° c and 1.5 min at 30°c before the addition
of 2.5 mm atp. the incubation was continued for
5 min then stopped by immersion into a hot water
bath. the content of camp was determined using
a camp-kit (amersham, u.k.).

2.5. blockade of [3h]spiperone binding in vivo
the procedure used for the in vivo binding of
[3h]spiperone has been described previously
(krhler et al., 1979; 1981b). groups of 4-8 male
sprague-dawley rats (150 g) received tail vein
injections (1.1 /~g, 15 #ci in 0.3 /~1 saline) of
[3h]spiperone (26 ci/mmol, new england
nuclear). this dose of the ligand is sufficient to
saturate neuroleptic binding sites in the brain regions studied. the test compounds were injected
i.p. 30 rain before the injections of [3h]spiperone
and the rats were decapitated 150 rain later. the
following brain regions were rapidly dissected on
ice: the olfactory tubercle, septum, striatum and
the substantia nigra, including the ventro-medial
tegmentum and the cerebellar cortex. the brains
were dissolved in soluene (1 ml) and processed for
liquid scintillation spectroscopy (efficacy approximately 50%) as described earlier (krhler et
al., 1981b). the specific binding of [3h]spiperone
was defined as the difference between the total
binding in a brain region and the binding in the
cerebellum or as the percent of the binding blocked
by (+)-butaclamol (5 mg kg/i.p.). the prevention
of binding by the neuroleptic drugs was expressed
in percent of the specific binding in saline-treated
rats.

462
2.6. blockade of [3h]n-propylnorapomorphine binding in vivo
the procedure used for the in vivo binding of
[3h]n-propylnorapomorphine ([3h]npa) was similar to that reported earlier (k6hler et al., 1981a).
briefly, groups of 4-8 male mice (anticimex,
stockholm, body weight 20 g) were given tail vein
injections of [3h]npa (5 #ci, new england
nuclear, 50 ci/mmol, in 0.3 ml saline containing
0.1%  xxxd228xxx ) and sacrificed 45 min later.
the striatum and cerebellum were rapidly dissected on ice. maximal specific binding was determined either by displacement with ( + ) butaclamol (5 m g / k g i.p.) or as the difference
between the radioactivity found in the cerebellum
and that found in the striatum. the test drugs
were injected (i.p.) 30 rain before [3h]npa administration.
2. z regional da turnover
the method used was based on a procedure
described by einarsson et al. (1975). the test
drugs were given i.p. 15 min prior to the
catecholamine synthesis inhibitor h 4 4 / 6 8 (amethyl- xxxd3459xxx  methylester. hc1, h~tssle, 250
m g / k g i.p.) and the rats were sacrificed 2 h later.
the animals were perfused transcardially under
pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg, mebumal ®) anaesthesia and under high pressure with 100 ml of 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 40% mgso 4 (ph 4.0). after perfusion, the
brain was rapidly removed from the skull and cut
into blocks containing the area of interest. the
brain pieces were immediately immersed into liquid
propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. subsequently,
the specimens were freeze-dried (falck et al., 1962)
and exposed to formaldehyde vapor for 1 h at
80 °c, embedded in paraffin and sectioned  xxxd1891xxx 
#m. the sections were placed on microscope slides
and cover-slipped with entellan® (merck). measurement of fluorescence intensity was made using
a leitz orthoplan microscope equipped with a
microspectrograph. the measuring diaphragm was
set at 40 #m. measurements were obtained from
the following structures: olfactory tubercle, nucleus
accumbens and striatum. at least six measure-

ments were made in each region and always replicated on two subsequent sections. background fluorescence was obtained by measuring from the
corpus callosum which lacks catecholamine-containing processes. all measurements were made
without knowledge about the pharmacological
treatment of the animals. the results were expressed as percent reduction in fluorescence compared to the saline + h44/68-treated group.
2.8. measurements of monoamines and monamine
metabolites
male sprague dawley rats (170-210 g) were
used. the test drugs were given i.p. and the animals
killed by decapitation 2 h later. the concentrations of da, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(dopac), homovanillic acid (hva), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa), 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht), noradrenaline (na) and free 3-methoxy4-hydroxy-phenethyleneglycol ( m h p g ) were assayed by a slight modification of the hplc method
with electrochemical detection as described earlier
(magnusson et al., 1980). immediately after
sacrifice the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle
and striatum were dissected on ice. the nucleus
accumbens and the olfactory tubercle of each rat
were pooled. following sonication in 0.1 m hc104,
one aliquot of the supernatant was injected directly into the chromatographic column for determination of the concentrations of da, dopac,
hva, 5-hiaa and 5-ht whereas the assay of na
was preceded by an adsorption step on alumina
and subsequent elution with hc104 (3 rain). the
mobile phase of the chromatographic column
(packed with nucleosil cx8 5 #m) was citrate
buffer (ph 4.25) containing hexyl sulphate (1.7 ×
10 -3 m) and methanol (8%). the detector potential was set at + 700 mv vs. an ag/ xxxg33xxx   xxxg2118xxx  reference
electrode.
2.9. radiolabelled compounds and test compounds
[3 h]spiperone (new england nuclear, spec. act.
26-31.7 ci/rnmol), [3h] xxxd2137xxx  (nuclear research centre, negev, israel, spec. act. 10.1 c i / m mol), [3h]wb4101 (new england nuclear, spec.

463
phine (npa) (new england nuclear, spec. act. 50
ci/mmol). the compounds were administered
either i.p. or orally at a volume of 5 ml/kg. the
following compounds were tested: ( + )-butaclamol
hc1 (ayerst), haloperidol (janssen),  xxxd3096xxx 
hc1 (astra), sulpiride (delagrange), 1-sulpiride
(ravizza), thioridazine hc1 (sandoz) and dl-amethyl- xxxd3459xxx  methyl-ester hc1 (h44/68,
h~ssle). the compounds were dissolved in saline
(0.9% naci) with the exception of haloperidol,
sulpiride and 1-sulpiride which were dissolved in
acetic acid and distilled water.
3. results

3.1. blockade of apomorphine-induced behaviours in
the rat
apomorphine given at a dose of 1 m g / k g s.c.
produced both hyperactivity and oral stereotypies.
fig. 2 shows the dose-dependent blockade of
apomorphine-induced behaviours produced by  xxxd3096xxx , sulpiride and haloperidol; the ed50
values for blockade of the apomorphine-induced
 xxxd3096xxx 

behaviours are presented for the compounds tested
in table 1.  xxxd3096xxx , sulpiride and thioridazine
blocked preferentially the apomorphine-induced
hyperactivity while haloperidol and chlorpromazine blocked stereotypies and hyperactivity at
about the same dose levels. haloperidol was about
3 times more potent than  xxxd3096xxx  which in
turn was about 50 times more potent than sulpiride
in blocking the hyperactivity induced by
apomorphine (table 1).
3.2. induction of catalepsy in the rat

even at the highest dose of  xxxd3096xxx  tested,
(49 #mol/kg) only a few rats displayed ptosis
while reliable ptosis was seen after haloperidol (1.3
/~mol/kg) and sulpidde (150-300 #mol/kg). in
contrast to haloperidol,  xxxd3096xxx  caused little
suppression of locomotion even at the higher doses
tested.  xxxd3096xxx  and sulpiride caused a weak,
atypical form of catalepsy (fig. 3). in contrast to
those receiving haloperidol and chlorpromazine,
both  xxxd3096xxx - and sulpiride-treated rats were
aroused by external tactile and auditory stimuli

which resulted in locomotor activity. the peak of
the cataleptic effect differed between compounds
and occurred 2-4 h after the injection of  xxxd3096xxx  and haloperidol while the peak effect of
sulpiride was not observed until 4-8 h after the
injection.  xxxd3096xxx  showed a marked separation between the doses required to block
apomorphine-induced hyperactivity and those
which induced catalepsy (fig. 3 and table 1). of all
the neuroleptics tested  xxxd3096xxx  showed the
highest ratio (24) between these two parameters.
sulpiride and thioridazine, similar to  xxxd3096xxx ,
showed a clear separation between production of
catalepsy and blockade of apomorphine-induced
hyperactivity (ratio 3.5 and 8.7, respectively), while
the separation between these measures was small
for haloperidol (ratio 1.6) and chlorpromazine
(ratio 2.1).

3.3. blockade of apomorphine-induced vomiting in
the dog
haloperidol was 2-3 times more potent than
sulpiride in inhibiting apomorphine-induced
vomiting in dogs 1 h after oral administration of
the compounds (fig. 4a).  xxxd3096xxx  was about
10 times less potent than haloperidol (fig. 4a). the
effect of  xxxd3096xxx  did not vary much with time
within the observation period (1-16 h) indicating a
long duration (fig. 4b).

the intensity of the stereotypies by 50% over the observation period of 60 min compared to apomorphine-treated rats, or the doses
which reduced by 50% the number of animals showing hyperactivity. the edsos were calculated from log-dose response curves and
are based on 5-6 dose levels with 6-8 animals per dose. catalepsy was examined in the bar test. a cataleptic state was scored if the rat
failed to remove itself from the bar within 60 s. edso, the dose at which 50% of the animals were cataleptic, was calculated from
log-dose response curves on the results obtained at the peak effect of each compound.

3.4. receptor binding studies in vitro

stituted benzamides had little affinity for this receptor.

haloperidol, chlorpromazine and thioridazine
had considerably varying affinities for the
[3h]spiperone binding site which labels dopamine
d 2 receptors. haloperidol was 5-6 times more active than thioridazine. the substituted benzamides
sulpiride and  xxxd3096xxx  both showed low affinity for the [3h]spiperone binding site in vitro,
 xxxd3096xxx  being 100 fold less potent than haloperidol (table 2) and about 7 times less potent
than sulpiride. thioridazine, but not  xxxd3096xxx 
or sulpiride, had a relatively high affinity for the
d 1 binding site labelled by [3h] xxxd2137xxx  assayed in the presence of  xxxd1927xxx  (hyttel,
1980). the d 1 / d 2 ratio was high for haloperidol,
low for chlorpromazine while thioridazine was
about equally potent on both the d 1 and d 2
binding sites. consistent with the low affinity for
dopamine d 1 receptors,  xxxd3096xxx  like sulpiride
was found to be a very weak inhibitor of dastimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the striaturn (ics0 > 100 #m for both compounds).
in addition to the inhibitory activity on d 2
receptors labelled by [3h]spiperone, both haloperidol and in particular chlorpromazine and
thioridazine were relatively potent inhibitors of the
cortical al-receptor (table 2) while the two sub-

all drugs tested caused a dose-dependent decrease of [3h]spiperone binding in all brain regions studied (fig. 5). in this study 1-sulpiride was
included instead of dl-sulpiride since data on the
latter have been published elsewhere (k6hler et al.,
1979, 1981b). haloperidol was found to be more
potent than both chlorpromazine and  xxxd3096xxx 
in displacing [3h]spiperone from both striatal and
extra-striatal areas while 1-sulpiride was the least
potent of the four compounds tested. the potency
of the four drugs in blocking [3h]spiperone binding was found to reflect their relative potencies in
blocking the behavioural effects of apomorphine.
while chlorpromazine and haloperidol produced
an approximately equal decrease in [3 h]spiperone
binding in striatal and extra-striatal areas, both
 xxxd3096xxx  and 1-sulpiride (similar to dl-sulpiride)
showed a preferential blockade of [3h]spiperone
binding in the substantia nigra, the olfactory
tubercle and the septum. both  xxxd3096xxx  and
1-sulpiride weakly blocked striatal [3h]spiperone
binding. thus, in the dose range within which
 xxxd3096xxx  and sulpiride were found to block

apomorphine-induced hyperactivity, no significant
displacement of [ 3h]spiperone was observed in the
striatum. moreover, both drugs caused a low maximal displacement in the striatum compared to the
other brain regions. thus, even at very high doses,
neither  xxxd3096xxx  nor 1-sulpiride displaced
striatal [3h]spiperone more than 40-50% in contrast to the 80-90% displacement by chlorpromazine and haloperidol.

3.6. displacement of [3h]n-propylnorapomorphine
in vivo
the in vivo binding of [3h]npa is saturable
and sensitive to a number of da agonists and
antagonists such as the substituted benzamides
(k6hler et al., 1981a). similar to the results with
[3h]spiperone binding in the rat, the compounds
tested produced a dose-dependent blockade of
specific [3h]npa binding in the mouse striatum
(fig. 6). the relative potencies of the compounds in
blocking striatal [3h]npa binding paralleled their
relative potency to block in vivo [3h]spiperone
binding (fig. 5a). thus, haloperidol,  xxxd3096xxx 
and chlorpromazine were found to be more potent
blockers of the [3h]npa binding than 1-sulpiride.
however, both  xxxd3096xxx  and 1-sulpiride blocked

[3h]npa binding more potently than [3h]spiperone binding in the striatum. moreover, the
maximal blockade by  xxxd3096xxx  and l-sulpiride
of striatal [3h]npa binding was found to be
about the same as that observed for haloperidol
and chlorpromazine (70-80%). this reduction was
greater than the maximal reduction of striatal
[3h]spiperone binding caused by the two benzamide drugs in the rat.

3. 7. regional da turnover
 xxxd3096xxx , like haloperidol and thioridazine,
caused a dose-dependent increase in da turnover
(measured as the decrease in da fluorescence
compared to the level in rats treated with amethyl- xxxd3459xxx ) in all brain regions examined.
at the lowest dose tested  xxxd3096xxx  like 1sulpiride and thioridazine but in contrast to haloperidol preferentially increased da turnover in the
olfactory tubercle without affecting da turnover
in the striatum (fig. 7). even at the highest dose
tested (5.6 # m o l / k g )  xxxd3096xxx , like thioridazine, caused a greater increase in da turnover in
the olfactory tubercle than in the striatum. thus,
 xxxd3096xxx  differs from thioridazine in its effects
on da turnover by discriminating between the
olfactory tubercle and the nucleus accumbens.

3.8. monoamine metabolism

preliminary studies show that a maximal increase in striatal hva and d o p a c levels was
obtained 2 h after either  xxxd3096xxx  or haloperidol. this time point was therefore chosen for
subsequent studies. at the lowest dose tested (1
/xmol/kg), which corresponds to the eds0 for
blockade of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity,
 xxxd3096xxx  did not significantly change da
metabolism (fig. 8). however, at 2 t t m o l / k g i.p.
there was a 75-100% increase of h v a / d o p a c in
both the striatum and limbic areas (olfactory
tubercle + nucleus accumbens). the percent increase in hva and d o p a c was about the same

in both striatal and limbic areas. sulpiride, on the
other hand, produced a 150% increase of
h v a / d o p a c in the limbic areas at the 50
/~mol/kg dose which corresponds to the eds0 for
blockade of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity.
at this dose level a 40-50% increase was observed
in the striatum. haloperidol produced a marked
elevation of both d a metabolites at 0.2 # m o l / k g ,
which is close to the eds0 for behavioural blockade (fig. 8). in contrast to  xxxd3096xxx , haloperidol
produced a higher elevation of both d o p a c and
hva in striatal than in the limbic tissue. moreover, the percent increase in hva exceeded that of
dopac.

4. discussion

the present studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3096xxx  is a potent and selective antagonist of
the central dopamine d 2 receptors.  xxxd3096xxx 
appears to produce few effects on other monoamine-receptor mechanisms. thus, in contrast to
thioridazine and chlorpromazine,  xxxd3096xxx  had
a low affinity for a-adrenoceptors in vitro and
failed to block adrenergic activity in the rat and

dog in vivo (submitted for publication). the lack
of interaction with a-adrenergic receptors probably partly explains the weak sedative action of
 xxxd3096xxx  in the rat since occupation of aadrenergic receptors is related to suppression of
locomotor activity in rodents (u'prichard et al.,
1978; ogren et al., 1981). further evidence for a
selective dopaminergic action of  xxxd3096xxx 
versus other monoaminergic mechanisms was provided by the observation of small effects of the

drug on na and 5-ht turnover as measured by
their respective metabolites in the striatum and the
olfactory tubercle (table 3). in contrast, an increased na turnover in the brain has been observed following administration of haloperidol,
chlorpromazine, clozapine or thioridazine (and6n
et al., 1970; biarki et al., 1975; nyb~ck and sedvall,
1970).
previous studies have indicated that substituted
benzamides may act on a subpopulation of central
da receptors (jenner and marsden, 1979; spano
et al., 1979) and sulpiride has been classified as a
selective dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist (jenner
et al., 1980). the low potency of  xxxd3096xxx  to
displace [3h] xxxd2137xxx  and to inhibit striatal
da sensitive adenylate cyclase activity indicates
that  xxxd3096xxx  does not block the d 1 receptor.
however, the affinity of  xxxd3096xxx  for
[3h]spiperone binding sites in vitro was considerably lower than predicted from the behavioural
results which showed that  xxxd3096xxx  was only 3
times less potent than haloperidol in blocking the
apomorphine-induced hyperactivity and 50 times
more potent than sulpiride. the discrepancy between the results of in vitro binding experiments
using [3h]spiperone as a ligand and the behavioural findings might be explained by the formation
of an active metabolite of  xxxd3096xxx . an alternative possibility is that  xxxd3096xxx  requires an

accessory site for binding which is disrupted in the
in vitro binding procedure.
on the other hand, in vivo binding studies with
 xxxd3096xxx  showed a dose-dependent blockade of
[3h]spiperone binding at doses which closely correlated to the eds0 for the blockade of
apomorphine-induced hyperactivity and for doses
which increase da turnover, thus,  xxxd3096xxx 
displaced [3h]spiperone in vivo in limbic and in
ventral tegmental structures but not in striatal
tissue at doses which selectively block apomorphine-induced hyperactivity. blockade of [3h]spiperone in the striatum was observed only at
high cataleptogenic dose levels of  xxxd3096xxx .
this separation was not observed for haloperidol
but is a typical feature of many substituted benzamide drugs including sulpiride (k6hler et al.,
1984). in addition, the maximum blockade by
 xxxd3096xxx  of [3h]spiperone in striatum was far
less than the blockade by haloperidol which caused
between 80-90% displacement of striatal
[3h]spiperone in vivo. taken together, these resuits support previous data showing that the induction of cataleptic behaviour was correlated with
displacement of [3h]spiperone in the striatum
while blockade of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity correlates with the displacement of the binding in extra-striatal brain areas (k0hler et al.,
1979; 1981b; 1984). one explanation for the rela-

471
tively low total displacement of striatal [3n]spiperone might be that [3h]spiperone labels a
larger number of different da receptors than do
 xxxd3096xxx  and sulpiride in vivo. however, it is
not likely that the regional selectivity of  xxxd3096xxx  is explainable by [3h]spiperone labelling multiple monoaminergic receptor sites. thus,
previous displacement studies using different types
of monoaminergic antagonists showed that with
the exception of that in prefrontal cortex,
[ 3h]spiperone binding in vivo appears to be mainly
related to da receptors (k6hler et al., 1984).
recent studies suggest that [3h]npa is a potent
and selective agonist at the d 2 receptors in vitro
(creese et al., 1982; seeman, 1980) and in vivo
(k6hler et al., 1981a; fuxe et al., 1980; van der
werf et al., 1983). although the dose-response
curves for blockade of [3h]npa binding by  xxxd3096xxx , haloperidol and sulpiride paralleled
their relative potencies to prevent in vivo
[3h]spiperone binding, it is interesting to note
that, unlike haloperidol,  xxxd3096xxx  and sulpiride
were more potent in blocking striatal [3h]npa
binding in vivo (k/shler et al., 1984), in particular
when expressed as maximal displacement of the
respective ligand (fig. 6). similar findings have also
been reported for other benzamide drugs, including metoclopramide and sulpiride, in both mouse
(kishler et al., 1984) and rat brain (fuxe et al.,
1983). thus, these observations provide further
evidence for a preferential interaction of substituted benzamide drugs with a subclass of da
receptors, presumably those not linked to adenylate cyclase.
the preferential displacement in vivo by  xxxd3096xxx  of [3h]spiperone in the extrastriatal
brain regions suggests either a selective distribution of the drug to these areas or alternatively a
differential distribution of the various types of da
receptors between the striatum and the olfactory
tubercle. of interest in this regard are our observations that  xxxd3096xxx , as well as sulpiride, increased da turnover more in the olfactory tubercle
than in striatal tissue, as measured by the tyrosine
hydroxylase inhibition model. a significant increase in da utilization in the olfactory tubercle
occurred at doses corresponding to the eds0 for
blockade by  xxxd3096xxx  of apomorphine-induced

hyperactivity. in contrast, increases in da turnover
in the striatum occurred only at dose levels that
blocked apomorphine-induced stereotypies and induced signs of catalepsy. these semiquantitative
results support earlier findings by fuxe and coworkers (1977) who used the same method and
demonstrated a selective increase of da turnover
in the olfactory tubercle by sulpiride. several biochemical studies have also shown a selective increase in da turnover in limbic structures such as
the olfactory tubercle or nucleus accumbens after
sulpiride, clozapine or thioridazine treatment in
the rat (and6n and stock, 1973; bartholini, 1977;
crow et al., 1975; fuxe et al., 1977; scatton et al.,
1979; waldmeier and maitre, 1976; westerink et
al., 1977). one explanation for these observations
could be the higher potency of substituted benzamides, including  xxxd3096xxx , in blocking limbic
as compared to striatal da receptors, which may
result in a preferential, compensatory activation of
the mesolimbic da pathways (see carlsson and
lindqvist, 1963).
however, other investigators studying the increase in dopac and hva following treatment
with atypical neuroleptics failed to find a dissociation between da metabolism in the striatum and
olfactory tubercle (wilk et al., 1975). the discrepancy between the synthesis inhibition method
and measurements of da metabolites could be
due to methodological factors. thus, bartholini
(1977) showed that sulpiride, clozapine and
thioridazine produced a greater increase in hva
levels in limbic than in striatal tissue when probenecid was used to block the egress of the acid. the
h p l c technique (magnusson et al., 1980) used in
the present study allowed simultaneous determination of dopac and hva in the limbic areas
(olfactory tubercle + nucleus accumbens) as well
as the striatum.
however, the samples from the olfactory
tubercle and nucleus accumbens were pooled,
which may have confounded the results since with
the synthesis inhibition method a preferential
activation of da utilization has only been observed
in the olfactory tubercle but not in the nucleus
accumbens following sulpiride treatment (see fuxe
et al., 1977). nevertheless, sulpiride caused a much
greater increase of dopac in the limbic than in

472
the striatal areas, while the da metabolites were
increased equally in both limbic and striatal areas
following  xxxd3096xxx  treatment. haloperidol was
found to increase the levels of dopac and hva
markedly at doses related to apomorphine blockade, and the percent increase was greater in
striatal than in limbic tissues (nucleus accumbens
+ olfactory tubercle). in the case of  xxxd3096xxx 
the threshold dose for the increase in hva and
dopac was somewhat greater than expected
from the behavioural data. the present results
could therefore suggest that  xxxd3096xxx  is relatively less potent than haloperidol in blocking the
dopamine receptor mechanisms regulating da
metabolism compared to those involved in the
utilization of the amine. moreover,  xxxd3096xxx 
and sulpiride appear to have a preferential effect
on the utilization of the amine in the mesolimbic
compared to mesostriatal neurons. the difference
between  xxxd3096xxx  and sulpiride may suggest
that sulpiride is more active on the autoreceptormediated regulation of da turnover in the mesolimbic neurons.
behavioural studies have also provided evidence
for multiple types of da receptors (di chiara et
al., 1976; fuxe et al., 1977; puech et al., 1978). it
has been proposed that the stereotypies (licking
and gnawing) and the hyperactivity induced by the
dopamine agonist apomorphine are associated with
stimulation of da receptors localized in the striatum and in the limbic brain areas (olfactory
tubercle, nucleus accumbens), respectively (ernst,
1967; pijnenburg et al., 1972; cools et al., 1976;
cools and van rossum, 1976; costall et al., 1977;
fuxe et al., 1977; ljungberg and ungerstedt, 1978;
0 g r e n et al., 1978). cataleptic effects of neuroleptic drugs have generally been attributed to
blockade of da receptors in the nigro-neostriatal
da pathways (carlsson, 1967). some evidence
also suggests that the emesis and hypothermia
induced by apomorphine are mediated through
stimulation of dopamine receptors distinguished
from those mediating stereotyped behaviours
(rotrosen et al., 1972; riffee et al., 1979).
the present study showed that both sulpiride,
 xxxd3096xxx  and the atypical neuroleptic drug
thioridazine blocked apomorphine-induced hyperactivity at dose levels which did not affect the

stereotypies while haloperidol was about equally
effective in blocking the stereotypies and hyperactivity. these results suggest that similarly to other
benzamides (e.g. sulpiride) but unlike haloperidol,
 xxxd3096xxx  blocks two types of dopamine receptor mechanisms in a selective manner. however,
 xxxd3096xxx  differed from sulpiride in two major
aspects. first, sulpiride-treated rats were cataleptic
at doses 3-4 times higher than the eds0 for the
inhibition of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity.
 xxxd3096xxx  on the other hand showed a much
higher separation between the dose range where
catalepsia was observed and that which caused
blockade of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity
(ratio 24). no such separation was found for
haloperidol or chlorpromazine. however, the low
cataleptogenic potential of  xxxd3096xxx  cannot be
explained by an antimuscarinic action since the
compound has neglible anticholinergic effects (unpublished observation). in this respect  xxxd3096xxx 
differs from thioridazine which has a potent antimuscarinic action (see miller and hiley, 1974).
these results suggest that  xxxd3096xxx  has a lower
affinity for those dopamine receptor mechanism(s)
mediating cataleptic behaviour compared to other
neuroleptics including sulpiride and thioridazine.
the present results also suggest that the dopamine
receptor(s) mediating cataleptic behaviour are distinct from those mediating stereotyped behaviour
and hyperactivity. however, it should be pointed
out that both  xxxd3096xxx  and sulpiride caused a
weak, atypical form of catalepsy as measured in
the bar test. it is possible, therefore, that under
somewhat different conditions or in more rigorous
tests for cataleptic behaviour, for example the
vertical grid test (di chiara et al., 1979) both
compounds would prove to be non-cataleptogenic
in the rat. this conclusion is supported by the
observation that rats treated with  xxxd3096xxx  or
sulpiride were sensitive to external (auditory)
stimulation implying that the measured catalepsy
may be related to weak sedation or motor suppression.
the relatively low potency of  xxxd3096xxx  versus
sulpiride and other benzamides to block
apomorphine-induced emesis in the dog further
distinguishes  xxxd3096xxx  from drugs which are
known to have a high affinity for da receptors

in conclusion,  xxxd3096xxx  has been shown to
be a selective dopamine d 2 antagonist with a low
cataleptogenic potency. both the in vivo receptor
binding studies, the effects on da utilization and
the behavioural effects of the compound suggest a
more powerful action on dopamine d e receptors
in the mesolimbic and extra-striatal da systems
than in the mesostriatal system.
