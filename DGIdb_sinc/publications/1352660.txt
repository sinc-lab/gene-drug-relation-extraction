fluorescence polarization techniques (reviewed in ref. 4).
several years ago we reported the results of a study that
compared the sensitivities of two selectively bred mouse
lines to the anesthetic effects of 17 sedative-hypnotic drugs
including barbiturate^.^ the mouse lines used in this study
were selectively bred for differences in duration of ethanolinduced anesthesia or sleep time.6’7these mouse lines,
designated long-sleep (ls) and short-sleep (ss), differ in
duration of  xxxd102xxx induced sleep-time because of differences in central nervous system sensitivity to ethanol; only
small differences in the rate of ethanol elimination exist.’
our analysis of the relative sensitivities of the two mouse
lines to the 17 test drugs yielded an interesting result: the
mouse lines differed in sensitivity to drugs with relatively
low lipid solubility whereas they did not differ in sensitivity
to highly lipid soluble drugs. this suggeststhat the selective
breeding of these mice was specific for anesthetic agents
with lipid solubilities which are similar to ethanol.
the actions of ethanol, in all probability, are quite
complex. the anesthetic actions, for example, are probably due to actions on more than one system as suggested

a classical (mendelian) genetic analysis of responses to eight sedative-hypnotic compounds (ethanol, urethane,  xxxd3432xxx ,
chloral hydrate,  xxxd285xxx , paraldehyde,  xxxd2620xxx , pentobarbital)
was conducted in crosses derived from mouse lines that were
selectively bred for differential duration of anesthesia following
ethanol. the sleep-time responses of these mice, the long-sleep
(ls) and short-sleep (ss) mouse lines, as well as the f1, f2 and
backcross (f1 x ls, f1 x ss) generations were measured. generally,
differences in responses among the generations were greater for
water soluble compounds than were differences for more lipid soluble compounds. also, the inheritance of responses to water soluble
compoundscould be explained primarily by additive effects of alleles
while the inheritance patternsfor more lipid soluble compoundswere
more complex. genetic correlation with ethanol response decreased
with increasing lipophilicity.these results suggest that the selection
of the ls-ss mouse lines was specific for water soluble anesthetic
agents. because several of these agents are known to act at gaba
receptors,examination of the interactions of compounds which differ
in lipid solubility at gaba receptors from ls and ss mice may prove
useful in elucidating the mechanism of the anesthetic actions of
ethanol and other drugs.

methods
animals
both sexes of the ls and ss mice as well as mice bred for use in the
mendelian analyses were used in these studies. the classical analysis was
constructed by reciprocal crosses of ls and ss mice to produce the f l
generation. it is assumed that the ls and ss mice are homozygous at all
loci which regulate the sleep-time response to ethanol. while the f1
animals are heterozygous at all loci where the parental ls-ss mice differ,
they should be isogenic at all loci involved in the sleep-time response.
thus, the ls, ss, and f1 animals can be considered pseudo-isogenic.
mice from the f1 generation were intercrossed to produce the f2
generation. crosses of male and female f1 animals to both sexes of the
parental ls and ss generations were made to produce the two backcross
generations (f1 x ls and f1 x ss). rearrangements of genes occur in
the f2 and backcross generations thereby breaking down spurious associations between traits.
all mice were raised at the institute for behavioral genetics, kept on
a 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle and were allowed food (wayne lab blox)
and water ad libitum. mice were weaned at 25 days of age and were
housed with one to five like-sex littermates. animals were 60 to 100 days
old when tested. all animals were tested only once and all testing was
conducted between 8:oo am and 4:oo pm.

drug administration
all of the drugs, with the exception of  xxxd2620xxx , were obtained
from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).  xxxd2620xxx  was a generous
gift of roche laboratories (nutley, nj). these drugs were administered
by intraperitoneal injection of the drug dissolved in physiological saline.
the injection volume for  xxxd3432xxx , chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde was 0.02 ml/g, whereas the injection volume for  xxxd285xxx , pento-

for the ls-ss parental generations, the main and interactive effects of
dose were assessed by anova. for those analyses in which significant
effects were found, the results were subjected to the tukey b post hoc
test. because no sex differences were found for any of the drugs, all of
the genetic analyses described below were performed with data from the
two sexes combined. additionally, ed6,,,,,," values, the dose at which
animals slept an average of 60 min, were calculated and the entire doseresponse curves for the ls-ss parental lines were analyzed by a computerized regression line comparison program. this program sequentially
tests for: (1) differences in homogeneity of variance (an f test), (2)
differences in slope (a t test) and ( 3 )whether the lines are superimposable
(i.e., identical) (a t test). this method of analysis takes into account all
points on the linear portions of the dose-response curves and therefore
is more powerful than using a a t test to test for differences in
values. also, unlike using an anova, the entire dose-response curves
for two groups can be compared even when the doses given to the two
groups do not overlap. therefore, this method allows greater flexibility
in analyzing dose-response data than is possible by anova.
the classical (mendelian) cross data were initially analyzed using the
method of br~el1.i~
a graphic triangle is constructed with this method.
mean values are plotted on the ordinate while gene dosage is plotted on
the abscissa. the mean values of the nonsegregating, pseudo-isogenic
populations (ls, ss, and f l generations) are plotted to form the three
corners of the triangle. if genetic control of a trait is purely additive (i.e.,
there is no dominance or epistasis) the f1 generation will fall directly on
the line which connects the two parental generations. this point, the
midparent value, is halfway between the two parental generations and is
equivalent to the average ofthe parental means. in the absence of epistasis
any deviation of the f1 generation from this midparent value is indicative
of dominance. furthermore, any deviation of the three segregating
generations (f2, f1 x ls, and f l x ss) from the lines of the triangle is
indicative of epistatic interaction. in the absence of epistasis, the f2
generation is expected to lie halfway between the two backcross generations.

the genetic data were then subjected to the means analysis of mather
and jinks.i4 this more sophisticated analysis utilizes a weighted (by
variance) least squares regression approach to obtain estimates of the
midparent value (m), an additive genetic effect ([d]) and a dominance
genetic effect ([h]) as well as the three epistatic parameters [i], b] and [i]
. for actual data sets, the fit of genetic models containing any or all of
these parameters can be assessed through x 2 testing. the expectations of
a full genetic model containing all of these parameters are presented in
table 1.
data for each of the drugs were first fitted to a model which only
included the m parameter; i.e., all other parameters were set to zero. if
there was no segregation among the generations, this model would fit
the data (i.e., a nonsignificant x2 would be calculated). subsequently,
data were fitted to each of the genetic models listed in table 2 and the
fit of each of these models was assessed by x 2 testing. the relative fit of
models was assessed by comparing the ratios of respective x2 degrees of
freedom (an f test; e.g., ref. 9). the simplest model which fit the data
was the best fitting model in each case.
genetic correlations, the degree to which two traits are related, were
calculated between response to ethanol and response to the other sedative-hypnotic agents. using data from the six generations, genetic correlations were estimated by the calculated pearson product-moment cortable 1. assumptions of a full genetic model including the parameters: m,
midparent value; [d], summation of additive genetic effects; [h], summation of
dominance deviations: [i] epistatic interaction between homozygous pairs of
alleles; b], epistatic interaction between homozygous and heterozygous pairs of
alleles; and [i] epistatic interaction between heterozygous pairs of alleles

inbred strains and no significant differences have been found in results
obtained using this method versus more sophisticated method^.'^.'^ the
relationship between these genetic correlations and the lipid solubility of
the drugs employed in these studies was analyzed by a correlational
analysis. specifically, the correlation between the log of the octanol/
water partition coefficients (log p) and the genetic correlation with
ethanol response was calculated. similarly, the correlation between the
log of the octanol/water partition coefficients (log p) and the ratio of ss

values was calculated. the octanol/water correlation
coefficients used were those determined by leo et al." due to concerns
to be addressed in the discussion, data for  xxxd3432xxx  and  xxxd2620xxx  were omitted from the analysis.

lipid solubility with the responses to the least lipid soluble
drug (ethanol) presented in fig. 1 and the responses to the
most lipid soluble drug (pentobarbital) presented in fig.
8. in the upper panels of the figures, the response of the
six generations to a single dose of each compound is
presented. in the upper left panels, values are presented in
bar graph form while, in the upper right panels, values are
presented in genetic triangle form.13 in the lower panels,
dose-response curves for the ls-ss parental generations
are presented. while significant differences were found
among the generations for all drugs tested (see figure
captions for p values), the degree of these differences
varied among the agents. also, the pattern of inheritance
differed dependent upon the drug tested.
the responses to ethanol are presented in fig. 1. ls and
ss mice differed markedly at the one common dose with
which they were tested (80 mmol/kg), f( 1,36) = 627.88,
p < 0.0001. analysis of the dose-response curves also
reveal large ls-ss differences (see table 3). the genetic
triangle displays an inheritance pattern which is primarily
additive. the means analysis, however, reveals that a
simple additive or additive-dominance model does not fit
these data. instead epistasis is indicated. it should be noted
that both ceiling and floor effects could be responsible for
this. most of the ls mice tested at this dose were anesthetized for the maximal 180 min while most of the ss and
many of the fl x ss mice never lost the righting response
at this dose. post hoc analyses (tukey b) reveal that the
ss do not differ from the f1 x ss backcross generation
presumably because of floor effects. this lack of a difference in all probability is the cause of the apparent epistasis.
responses to urethane are presented in fig. 2. similar
to the finding for ethanol, the ls and ss lines differed
markedly at the one common dose at which they were

greater sensitivity than the ss line, f( 1,23) = 3252.6, p <

markedly (see table 3). the genetic triangle indicates an

curves differ. unlike the pattern for ethanol and urethane,

the genetic triangle indicates dominance as the primary
inheritance pattern. post hoc analyses reveal that only the
ls mice and the f l x ls backcross generation differ from
the ss mice. furthermore, the response of the f2 generation is more similar to the response of the f l x ss
backcross generation than the response of the f1 x ls
generation. consistent with this, the means analysis reveals that the inheritance is additive with significant deviations due to epistatic interactions. as was the case with
ethanol and urethane, floor and ceiling effects may be
partially responsible for the observed inheritance pattern.

no line x dose interaction was seen for either drug. the

however, are not as great as those seen for ethanol as

the sleep-time responses to  xxxd2620xxx  are presented
in fig. 7. ls mice were more sensitive to the anesthetic
properties of this drug than were ss mice, f( 1,36) = 15 1.7,
p < 0.0001; however, this drug elicited a most unusual
response in the ss mice. long-lasting seizures, rather than
a typical anesthetic response were observed. animals that
seized were given a zero sleep-time score. ls mice and
mice of the other derived generations exhibited more
classical anesthetic responses. however, several animals
of the f2 and f1 x ss generations also failed to lose the
righting response and exhibited seizures. while genetic
models were not fitted to the seizure data, these findings
suggest that the seizure response is a recessive trait. the
inheritance of the anesthetic response is best described by
an additive model with some epistasis. the genetic triangle
reveals that the response of the f2 generation deviates the

most from the expectations of a simple additive model.
post hoc analysis supports this in that the f2 generation
does not differ significantly from the ss line.
the pattern for inheritance of sensitivity to pentobarbital is quite different from the inheritance seen for the
other agents as can be seen in fig. 8. anova and the
analysis of the dose-response curves revealed that ls and
ss mice did not differ following administration of this
compound, f( 451) = 0.69, p = 0.41 (see table 3). while
overall differences were found among the six generations
(see figure legend for f value), post hoc analysis revealed
significant differences only between the ss and f2 and the
ss and fl x ss generations. the means analysis reveals
that a complex model including additivity and all three

thus, in this respect the major assumptions of mendelian
cross data may not have been violated.
the segregation pattern of ethanol sensitivity yielded
results that are best explained by an additive or additivedominance model with some epistasis (gene interaction).

roacetic acid, the probable major metabolite of  xxxd3432xxx , is highly toxic." it might be that differences seen
among and within the generations in sleep-time response
are confounded by differences in production of, or toxic
response to, trifluoroacetic acid.  xxxd2620xxx  was not
included because the ss mice, and several of the f2 and
fl x ss animals, failed to lose the righting response and
exhibited convulsions instead. this might be indicative
that a convulsant metabolite is formed in some animals,
but this is doubtful because animals exhibited convulsions
very shortly after  xxxd2620xxx  administration. nevertheless, the response of these animals to  xxxd3432xxx  and
 xxxd2620xxx  makes genetic modeling or other analyses of
an anesthetic response questionable. therefore,  xxxd2620xxx  and  xxxd3432xxx  were not included in the analyses
presented in the top half of fig. 9, but removal of these
drugs from the analyses does not affect the significance of
the relationship between the genetic correlation to ethanol
response and the log of the octanol/water partition coefficient ( r = -0.96 & 0.03; p < 0.001 with these drugs
omitted and r = -0.97 +- 0.03, p < 0.00 1 with these drugs
included).
only small ls-ss differences in sensitivity to chloral
hydrate were detected and the segregation pattern did not
fit a simple model. it has been argued that the depressant
actions of chloral hydrate are due to its rapid conversion
to the more lipid soluble t r i c h l o r ~ e t h a n o l (log
' ~ ~ ~p~=
0.85)." recently, we presented evidence that chloral hytherefore, the
drate has anesthetic activity of its
sleep-time response to chloral hydrate is probably mediated by both chloral hydrate and its active metabolite,
trichloroethanol. if this is the case, the segregation analysis
for chloral hydrate may be different from ethanol because
of differences among the generations in rate of formation
of trichloroethanol as well as differences in sensitivity to
chloral hydrate and its major metabolite. in addition, the
ratios and log p values (fig.
correlation between ed60min
9) may be confounded by an inaccurate estimate of the
partition coefficient. the partition coefficient for the biologically active species in vivo is probably somewhere
between the partition coefficients for chloral hydrate and
trichloroethanol.
pentobarbital, the most lipid soluble drug tested, showed
very small ls-ss differences and inheritance of response
to this drug did not fit an additive model. several studies
have compared the relative responses of the ls and ss
mice to p e n t ~ b a r b i t a l . ~ ?with
~ ' - ~ the
~ exception of the
study of alpern and mcintyre,*' all of these studies obtained results which agree with those obtained in the
current study; i.e., depending on the pentobarbital dose,
either no ls-ss difference was seen or the ss mice were
slightly more responsive. any differences in the responsiveness of ls and ss mice to pentobarbital, however,
appear to be due pharmacokinetic factors and not to
differences in cns sensitivity.24s26
several other genetic studies provide additional evi-

519

dence that genetic influences on ethanol- and pentobarbital-induced sleep-time are different. two earlier studies
examined the relative sensitivities of the ls and ss mice
and derived generations to several sedative-hypnotic
drug^.^^,^^ in both studies the inheritance pattern for pentobarbital sensitivity differed from the inheritance pattern
for ethanol sensitivity. recently, allan and harris3' examined the sleep-times of 93 heterogeneous stock (hs)
mice following pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and ethanol (3.5
g/kg). the correlation between pentobarbital- and
 xxxd102xxx induced sleep-time was nonsignificant ( r = 0.09).
the results of all of these studies may mean that ethanol
and pentobarbital elicit their hypnotic effects via totally
different mechanisms. alternatively, it may be that no
genetic variance exists for those sites that are affected by
both drugs in the ls and ss lines or in the hs mice from
which they were derived.
a significant correlation between log p and genetic
correlation was found in the analysis presented in the top
half of fig. 9, but examination of the figure reveals that
the significance of the relationship is primarily due to the
lack of a genetic correlation between pentobarbital and
ethanol. significant genetic correlations were found between ethanol and all of the other agents tested except for
pentobarbital, the most lipid soluble agent tested. while
not shown in the analysis in fig. 9, a genetic correlation
for  xxxd2620xxx , the next most lipid soluble agent, and
alcohol was calculated. this was also not significant. in
the present study, no drugs with lipid solubilities between
those of  xxxd2620xxx  (log p = 0.77) and pentobarbital
(log p = 2.03) were tested.
while little is known about the molecular mechanisms
of action of anesthetic drugs such as urethane, chloral
hydrate and paraldehyde, considerable progress has been
made in recent years in understanding the mechanisms of
action of the barbiturates. a major site of action for the
barbiturates appears to be associated with the gababenzodiazepine receptor. there are differences, however,
among the barbiturates in their actions at this receptor
complex. leeb-lundberg and olsen" have observed that
lipid soluble barbiturates are much more potent in increasing the affinity of [3h]-diazepamfor its binding site on rat
cortical membranes than are water soluble barbiturates.
the results reported here are consistent with this finding
in that the inheritance pattern for the relatively lipid
insoluble  xxxd285xxx  was markedly different from the inheritance pattern obtained with pentobarbital. it may be that
a comparison of the effects of water and lipid soluble
barbiturates on properties of the gaba receptor will
provide much needed insight into a major mechanism of
action of ethanol.
mendelian or classical crosses have been used only
rarely to assess genetic associations between drug responses
and the results of such an analysis must not be interpreted
too broadly. the observation that the segregation patterns
for two traits are similar does not necessarily mean that

520

the genes which regulate these two traits are identical.
rather, this result might only mean that similar models
explain each segregation pattern. for example, ls mice
frequently have a peach coat color and ss are frequently
albino but if coat color segregated into the various generations along with ethanol sensitivity this would not necessarily mean that “coat color genes” are also alcohol
genes. however, if the segregation patterns for two traits
are clearly different, the argument can be made that it is
not likely that the two traits that are associated in the
parental strains are regulated by precisely the same gene
or set of genes. thus, the results reported here do not
prove that the same genes regulate ethanol and  xxxd285xxx  or
other water soluble drug sleep-time responses, but these
results clearly argue that different genes regulate the hypnotic responses to ethanol and pentobarbital. as with all
correlational analyses, the reliability of a correlation increases with the number of observations, but it is best to
remember that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. nonetheless, the observation that sensitivity to the
anesthetic actions of all of the water soluble drugs is
genetically correlated with sensitivity to the anesthetic
actions of ethanol argues that the ls-ss differences in
sensitivity to the anesthetic actions of water soluble drugs
does not occur by chance.
the intent of a classical cross analysis is to break down
linkage, and if two traits show differing patterns of inheritance, an argument can be made for differential genetic
regulation. thus, because the apparent association between ethanol and water soluble anesthetic drug response
was not broken down, it seems possible that the anesthetic
responses to ethanol and these other water soluble drugs
are regulated by some of the same genes. however, more
stringent tests must be done to assess whether common
genes regulate traits which show similar inheritance patterns. one strategy is to measure the correlation between
two traits in a segregating population such as an f2
generation or a heterogeneous stock, but this method may
provide erroneous information if measuring the first trait
affects the second. this, we believe, is a significant concern
when measuring drug-induced anesthesia because many
animals exhibit symptoms of toxicity after testing. therefore, the method of choice is to use animals with identical
genotype where each animal is tested only once. recombinant inbred strains, which are derived by inbreeding the
f2 generation derived from crossing two parental strains,
are especially valuable in testing genetic associations because the procedure used in developing recombinant
inbreds breaks down linkage and then fixes genes in new
configurations. the accompanying paper32used recombinant inbred strains derived from the ls and ss mice to
test whether the anesthetic responses to drugs with low
lipid solubility are regulated by the same genes. the results
obtained are in agreement with the results reported in fig.
9 in this paper: there is a significant negative correlation
between lipid solubility and the degree of genetic com-

de fiebre et al.

monality. in other words, more genes are shared in common that regulate the sleep-time response for water soluble
drugs than for lipid soluble drugs.
as noted above, recombinant inbred strains may be the
best tool available to test genetic hypotheses concerning
ethanol and other drug actions, but recombinant inbred
strains, although very valuable, are often not available.
consequently, their utility is often limited. however, the
genetics of alcohol literature is rich with studies that have
utilized only two strains or lines of animals and attempted
to correlate biochemical differences with genetically influenced behavioral differences. the interpretation of such
studies is severely limited by a lack of degrees of freedom.
this is especially the case if the parental line difference is
one which was developed using a selective breeding program that did not include replicate lines as is the case with
the ls-ss selection. the results reported here suggest that
the classical cross may be of value in testing genetic
hypotheses. while this method increases available degrees
of freedom, we must emphasize that the results obtained
should not be interpreted too broadly.
in summary, the segregation patterns for all of the drugs
tested were not identical, but the similarity was greater for
those compounds with similar lipid solubilities. one possible explanation for these findings is that the overlap with
ethanol in terms of sites or mechanisms of action decreases
as lipid solubility increases. the finding that ethanol’s
anesthetic actions are regulated by seven to eight “effective
factor^"^*'^ might mean that ethanol exerts its effects by
altering the activities of seven to eight gene products. if
each of these gene products is equieffective in regulating
sleep-time, researchers are faced with the difficult task of
attempting to explain only a small fraction of the response
on the basis of actions on a specific gene product. it may
be that greater progress could be made if future studies
include analyses of the actions of drugs that showed differential segregation patterns in the study reported here.
