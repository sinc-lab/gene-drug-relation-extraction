to determine whether the  xxxg681xxx  receptor
2 (erbb2) and akt1 can alter the in vivo growth of mcf-7 cells,
parental cells or cells stably transfected with constitutively
active akt1 (myr-akt1) or dominant-negative akt1 mutants
(k179m-akt1 and r25c-akt1) were implanted into athymic
nude mice. tumor growth was monitored in the presence or
absence of the antiestrogen tamoxifen and the selective erbb2
inhibitor, ag825. mcf-7 [parental or empty vector transfected, cytomegalovirus (cmv)] and myr-akt1 cells formed
tumors upon estradiol supplementation after 20 –30 d (59-, 29-,
and 17-fold increase in tumor volume, respectively). tamoxifen and ag825 blocked the estradiol effect by 93 and 96% in
mcf-7 xenografts, 88 and 81% in cmv xenografts, and 91% in
myr-akt1 xenografts. furthermore, ag825 suppressed the
growth of established tumors in cmv and myr-akt1 inoculated animals by 68 and 75%, respectively, as compared with
continued estrogen supplementation, suggesting a role for

he growth and development of breast cancer is
regulated by a complex set of factors, including hormones, growth factors, and their receptors. estrogens are the
most important etiological factors for many breast cancers,
playing a critical role in tumorigenesis. prolonged exposure
of reproductive organs to estrogen leads to an increased risk
for this disease (1). the effects of estrogens are mediated by
direct binding to estrogen receptors (ers) in the nucleus,
after which the receptors dimerize and bind to specific estrogen response elements located in the promoters of target
genes (classical genomic effect). hormone binding causes a
conformational change in the hormone binding domain that
leads to recruitment of specific coactivators (2). another
genomic mechanism (nonclassical genomic effect) involves

erbb2. when k179m-akt1 or r25c-akt1 cells were injected
into ovariectomized animals, tumor growth was reduced upon
estradiol treatment by 95% and 98%, respectively, supporting
a role for akt1. in contrast to ovariectomized animals, in intact animals, myr-akt1 cells could establish tumors without
estradiol priming after 40 –50 d (20-fold increase in tumor volume). loss of akt1 phosphorylation was associated with tumor growth inhibition. immunohistochemical assays showed
that in tumors from parental and cmv xenografts, estradiol
decreased  xxxg730xxx -␣ expression and induced  xxxg1737xxx  expression and akt phosphorylation, effects that were inhibited by tamoxifen, ag825, and r25c-akt1
by 89, 82, and 77% for  xxxg1737xxx  expression and
48, 66, and 73% for pakt expression, respectively. cumulatively, our results suggest that akt1 and erbb2 are involved in
in vivo tumorigenesis and modulation of  xxxg730xxx -␣
expression and activity. (endocrinology 148: 1171–1180, 2007)

binding transcription factors in the nucleus. in addition,
membrane-associated nongenomic actions of estrogens can
lead to altered functions of proteins in the cytoplasm and to
regulation of gene expression (2). these actions are rapid and
associated with activation of several protein kinase cascades
that transduce the signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
activating nuclear transcription factors, and phosphorylating
er-␣. finally, growth factors can also activate protein kinase
cascades, leading to phosphorylation and activation of nuclear ers (ligand-independent activation) (2).
er-␣ is the selection criterion for patients to endocrine
therapy. seventy percent of breast cancers express er-␣ and
progesterone receptors (prs). however, most responsive tumors will eventually acquire resistance (3). the antiestrogen
tamoxifen is a successful drug for er-␣-positive breast cancer
treatment and is currently prescribed for the prevention of
breast cancer in high-risk women (4). many tumors that first
respond to tamoxifen will eventually develop resistance to
the drug (acquired tamoxifen resistance) (3). in contrast, the
pure antiestrogen  xxxd2165xxx ,780 has no estrogenic properties
because it causes destruction of the er (5). tamoxifen resistance is heterogeneous and multifactorial. a tamoxifen-stimulated phenotype may occur in some patients, other tumors
may become resistant through changes in immunity, drug

pharmacokinetics, or host endocrinology (6). growth factor
interactions may also occur, leading to breast tumor growth
by growth factor-induced er-␣ activity through activation of
protein kinases resulting in er-␣ phosphorylation (5).
er-positive breast cancer cells produce autocrine and/or
paracrine growth factors that activate their intrinsic tyrosine
kinases, initiating a complex cascade of signal transduction.
the members of the  xxxg681xxx  receptor
(egfr) superfamily of tyrosine kinases are often activated in
breast cancer (7, 8). human  xxxg681xxx  receptor
2 (erbb2) is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast
tumors (6, 9, 10). erbb2 activation, via dimerization with
other egfr family members or itself, can lead to the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-k) the
serine/threonine protein kinase, akt (11). tumors with
erbb2 overexpression respond poorly to antiestrogen treatment (12). preclinical data have demonstrated that inhibition
of erbb2 signaling can restore hormone responsiveness in
erbb2 overexpressing endocrine-resistant breast tumors, delay the development of endocrine resistance, and increase the
antiproliferative effect of endocrine agents (13–15). these
effects were, in part, mediated by the inhibition of the pi
3-k/akt and mapk pathways (16 –18). akt and mapk activate er-␣ by direct phosphorylation at s167 and s118,
respectively (17–19).
the growth factor-coupled activation of pi 3-k and its
central effector, akt, is a critical pathway in oncogenesis.
there are three isoforms of akt in human cells: akt1,  xxxg119xxx ,
and  xxxg120xxx , and all three have the same domain organization.
akt can be activated by growth factors that bind to their
membrane receptors, phosphorylating their tyrosine residues and leading to pi 3-k activation. pi 3-k generates membrane-bound phoshoinositides, which act as second messengers and then recruit akt and its upstream kinases,
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (pdk)1 and  xxxg1715xxx , to
the membrane via its ph domain (20). this membrane localization facilitates akt phosphorylation at t308 and s473
(20). activated akt then translocates to the cytosol and nucleus to phosphorylate several downstream protein targets
(21). these phosphorylation events lead to cell survival,
growth, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, angiogenesis,
migration, invasion, and metabolism (8, 21). constitutive
activation of akt, chromosomal amplification of akt or pi
3-k, and the deletion of the  xxxg1870xxx 
deleted from chromosome 10 may play a role in tumor formation. er-␣ but not er-␤ can directly bind to pi 3-k (22, 23)
and estradiol stimulation increases er-␣-associated pi 3-k/
akt1 activity (22, 24, 25). the frequency of pi 3-k/akt alterations found in breast tumors suggests the occurrence of
hormone-dependent cancers with this pathway activated.
therefore, aberrant akt signaling may block antiestrogen
actions and those er-positive cancers with akt signaling
might be candidates for antiestrogens in combination with
akt inhibitors (15).
we previously demonstrated a cross talk between growth
factors and  xxxg730xxx  signaling that converges in the
erbb2/pi 3-k/akt pathway in hormone-dependent mcf-7
breast cancer cells (24, 26). the purpose of this study was to
extend our in vitro observations (26) by examining whether
the erbb2/pi 3-k/akt1/er-␣ signal transduction pathway

lehnes et al. • effect of estradiol on in vivo tumorigenesis

is similarly activated in vivo. in this study, we demonstrate
that akt1 and erbb2 are involved in in vivo tumorigenesis
and modulation of er-␣ expression and activity.
materials and methods
tissue culture
mcf-7 cells were stably transfected with either dominant-negative
akt1 mutants (k179m-akt1 or r25c-akt1) or a constitutively active
mutant of akt1 (myr-akt1) as described elsewhere (24). the expression
vector alone, cmv, was used as a negative control. monolayer cultures
of mcf-7 cells (parental and stably transfected with cmv and the akt1
mutants) were grown in improved mem (imem) supplemented with
5% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of 750 ␮g/ml  xxxd2191xxx 
( xxxg418xxx ). at 80% confluence, the medium was replaced with phenol redfree imem containing 5% charcoal-treated calf serum (27) in the presence or absence of 750 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx . the calf serum was pretreated with
sulfatase and dextran-coated charcoal to remove endogenous steroids
(28). after 2 d, the medium was changed into serum-free, phenol red-free
imem supplemented with fibronectin, glutamine, hepes, trace elements, and transferrin. cells were harvested and inoculated into athymic nude mice.

plasmids
the expression vector for wild-type akt1 (29), the kinase defective
akt1 mutants, k179m-akt1 (30) and r25c-akt1 (30), and the constitutively active akt1 mutant, myrakt1, were generated as hindiii-bamhi
inserts in pcmv-6 (30).

western blot analysis
snap-frozen tumors were crushed and minced under liquid nitrogen
and homogenized by sonication (31) in nonidet p-40 lysis buffer. the
homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at
100,000 ⫻ g for 30 min at 4 c. protein loading buffer was added and
lysates were heated to 95–100 c for 5 min. protein concentration in the
lysates was determined using the standard bradford assay. equal
amounts of protein (100 ␮g) were loaded onto sds-polyacrylamide gels.
the samples were electrotransferred onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes and the membranes were washed in pbs four times at room
temperature. membranes were kept in blocking buffer overnight at 4 c
and incubated with either an antiphospho-akt antibody (s473) or an
anti-akt antibody (new england biolabs, beverly, ma) for 1 h at room
temperature. after three additional washes in pbs, membranes were
incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. reactivity
with a monoclonal anti-␣-actin antibody (chemicon, temecula, ca) was
used as a control for protein loading on each blot. detection was performed by chemiluminescence, using the super signal chemiluminescent substrate (pierce, rockford, il).

athymic mouse model system
er-positive mcf-7 human breast cancer cell lines [parental and stably transfected with the empty vector, cmv; constitutively active akt1
(myr-akt1); or dominant-negative akt1 (k178m-akt1 and r25c-akt1)
(24)] were cultured as described previously (31). the athymic nude mice
were 4- to 6-wk-old female ovariectomized balb/c-␯⫹/␯⫹ strain, approximately 15 g in weight and were purchased from taconic (germantown, ny). the animals were housed four to five per cage in a
pathogen-free environment under controlled conditions of light (12-h
light, 12-h dark cycle), temperature (22 ⫾ 3 c), and humidity (60 ⫾ 10%)
and received sterilized food and water ad libitum. mice were observed
daily. animal care was in accordance with a georgetown university
institutional animal care and use committee-approved protocol.
approximately 5 ⫻ 106 subconfluent mcf-7 cells (parental or stably
transfected with the empty vector or with the akt1 mutants), resuspended in 0.1 ml of medium (imem phenol-red free ⫹ 5% ccs ⫾ 750
␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx ) were injected sc into two sites of the flanks (on the left and
right sides) of female nude mice to initiate tumor formation (32). estradiol supplementation was provided in form of a 90-d release 0.25 mg

estradiol pellet (innovative research of america, sarasota, fl), placed
sc in the interscapular region of the mice to stimulate tumor growth. the
surgical incision was closed with a staple.
in the tumorigenesis experiments, animals were randomly divided
into different treatment groups for the parental mcf-7 cells as well as
for mcf-7 cells stably transfected with the empty vector, cmv, and
myr-akt1: 1) vehicle treated [dimethylsulfoxide (dmso)] control
group, 2) estradiol-supplemented group, 3) tamoxifen-treated group
(500 ␮g/d, monday through friday; sc injection), 4) ag825-treated
group (50 ␮g/kg䡠d, ip injection), 5) estradiol supplemented in the presence of tamoxifen, and 6) estradiol supplemented in the presence of
ag825. we chose ip dosing for ag825 to allow the component to reach
maximum exposure regardless of its oral bioavailability. in addition, for
the dominant-negative akt1 transfected cell lines, k179m-akt1 and
r25c-akt1, as well as for intact mice inoculated with either cmv or
myr-akt1 cells, animals were divided into two groups: 1) vehicle-treated
animals (dmso) and 2) estradiol supplemented animals. ag825 was
dissolved in dmso [1% (vol/vol)] and a corresponding volume of
peanut oil was added to yield a final concentration of 50 ␮g/kg䡠d.
tamoxifen was dissolved in ethanol and peanut oil was added to yield
its final concentration of 500 ␮g/d. each group consisted of at least four
to 10 animals inoculated bilaterally. tumor volumes and body weight
were measured twice a week with a vernier caliper by a single observer.
a trained observer closely monitored the clinical condition of the animals. mean tumor volumes were determined by measuring tumors at
all implantation sites. volumes were calculated in cubic millimeters as
the product of the width, length, and depth and reported to the percent
of body weight of each animal.
the effect of ag825 on the growth of mcf-7 cells (parental, cmv, and
myr-akt1) established tumors was also studied after tumors had
reached a size of approximately 200 mm3 (2–5 wk). at this time, tumorbearing animals were randomly allocated to three treatment groups: 1)
continued estradiol supplementation; 2) continued estradiol supplementation and treatment with ag825; and 3) removal of the estradiol
pellet. the effect of ag825 was compared between groups 1 and 2 and
between groups 2 and 3.
at the end of the experiment (52–104 d from the day of cell inoculation), mice were killed by cervical dislocation, tumors were excised,
and all organs were examined macroscopically. tumors, livers, and
kidneys from each mouse were either immediately snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at ⫺70 c or were placed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin until embedded in paraffin and processed for immunohistochemical staining or staining with hematoxylin and eosin.
repeated anova was used to test the significant difference between
treatments or between experiments. anova was used to test the significant difference between treatments at each day point. for animals
inoculated bilaterally with cells treated with the same compound, mean
value as one observation was considered.

immunohistochemistry
for immunostaining of formalin fixed-paraffin embedded tumors,
sections were cut at 5 ␮m thickness. the deparaffinized sections were
pretreated for antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (ph 6.0) with incubation
in a steamer for 20 min. after allowing to cool slowly to room temperature, slides were treated with 0.3% (wt/vol)  xxxd2298xxx  in
methanol for 30 min to block endogenous peroxides activity, and then
a blocking step was conducted by incubation of sections in 10% normal
serum, the same as used in the secondary antibody. then the sections
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber
with the appropriate dilution of the primary antibodies directed against
either akt (1:100; cell signaling technology, inc., danvers, ma), pakt
(1:50; cell signaling technology), pr (1:100, dako, carpinteria, ca), or
erbb2 (1:100; dako). the secondary biotinylated antibody reagents were
mouse and rabbit antibody, respectively (1:200 dilution). sections were
incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibody, followed by incubation in an abc kit (vector laboratories, ltd., burlingame, ca). then
3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate was used for detection. after washing, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin
for 20 sec, dehydrated, and mounted with a coverslip. sections were
evaluated for membrane, nuclear, or cytoplasmic staining. a semiquantitative score (negative, 0; weak, 1⫹; moderate, 2⫹; strong, 3⫹) was
determined based on the staining intensity.

results
dominant-negative akt1 mutants and the selective erbb2
inhibitor ag825 inhibit in vivo tumorigenesis in
ovariectomized athymic nude mice

because we have previously shown that akt1 is a major
downstream signaling molecule in mcf-7 cells (30, 32, 35),
we further investigated in vivo regulation of akt in a xenograft model of human breast cancer growth. hormone-responsive breast tumors can be formed in ovariectomized
athymic mice using mcf-7 cells and estrogen supplementation (36, 37). female ovariectomized athymic mice implanted with mcf-7 cells are also an appropriate model of
postmenopausal women with estrogen-dependent breast
cancer because plasma levels of estradiol in these mice are
similar with those observed in postmenopausal women
(27–38 and 10 – 40 pg/ml, respectively) (38, 39).
mcf-7 cells (parental and stably transfected with the
empty vector, cmv, k179m-akt1, r25c-akt1, or myr-akt1)
were bilaterally inoculated into ovariectomized female nude
mice. tumor formation was monitored after estradiol treatment in the presence or absence of tamoxifen or ag825 (fig.
1). tumors were visible from 23 to 30 d after estradiol supplementation in mice inoculated with parental or cmvtransfected cells (fig. 1, a and b). tumor volume increased
by 59- (p ⫽ 0.0013) and 29-fold (p ⬍ 0.0001) the next 68 d (fig.
1a) and 52 d (fig. 1b), respectively. tamoxifen and ag825
caused a marked reduction in tumor development, with 93%
(p ⫽ 0.0031) and 96% (p ⫽ 0.004) reduction in tumor size,
respectively, in mcf-7 parental cells and with 88% (p ⬍
0.0001) and 81% reduction (p ⬍ 0.0001), respectively, in
cmv-transfected cells.
additionally, growth of mcf-7 cells transfected with
k179m-akt1 or r25c-akt1 cells after estradiol supplementation was markedly impaired [95% (p ⬍ 0.0001) and 98%
(p ⬍ 0.0001) reduction, respectively] (fig. 1, d and e). in two
experiments, no tumors were formed until d 68 and 104,
respectively, when ovariectomized mice were inoculated
with k179m-akt1 and supplemented with an estradiol pellet. in a third experiment, however, small tumors appeared,
presenting a 3-fold increase in volume at d 101, compared
with non-estradiol-treated animals. tumor growth was substantially delayed because tumors were formed at 72 d upon
estradiol treatment. when we used r25c-akt1, in one experiment, no tumors were formed by d 68 in the presence of
the estradiol pellet, whereas in another experiment tumors
appeared in some animals at d 38 and represented a 82.9%
inhibition when compared with cmv-inoculated and estradiol-treated animals.
in ovariectomized animals, myr-akt1 cells did not show
tumor development in the absence of estradiol. only upon
estradiol supplementation, tumors appeared after 20 –34 d
and showed a 17-fold increase in tumor volume (p ⬍ 0.0001)
(fig. 1c). ag825 inhibited the effect of estradiol, resulting in
94% (p ⬍ 0.0001) reduction in tumor volume.
these results implicate akt1 and erbb2 action as important mechanisms in tumorigenesis of mcf-7 cells in ovariectomized athymic nude mice.

ag825 inhibits the growth of established tumors in
ovariectomized animals

it has been shown that estrogen withdrawal results in a
partial regression of mcf-7 tumors due to an inhibition of
cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (40). to determine whether ag825 can also inhibit the growth of established tumors, another xenograft protocol was used. mcf-7
cells (stably transfected with empty vector and myr-akt1)
were injected into ovariectomized mice to initiate tumor
formation by estrogen supplementation. mice were divided
into three treatment groups after tumors reached approxi-

mately 200 mm3 2–5 wk after inoculation: estrogen withdrawal (c), estrogen treatment in the absence (e2) or presence
of ag825 (e2⫹ag825). a representative experiment is depicted in fig. 2. ag825 suppressed the growth of established
tumors in both cmv- and myr-akt1-inoculated ovariectomized animals almost to the same extent as estrogen withdrawal. when compared with continued estrogen supplementation, the tumors in cmv- and myr-akt1 xenografts
were inhibited by 68% (p ⬍ 0.0001) (fig. 2a) and 75% (p ⫽
0.0004) (fig. 2b), respectively, upon ag825 treatment. these
results strongly suggest a role for erbb2 in tumor growth.

tal mcf-7 cells increased by 36-fold (p ⬍ 0.0005) upon estrogen supplementation. a similar growth upon continuous
treatment with estrogen in median tumor weight was reported earlier in the same nude mouse mcf-7 xenograft
model (41). the estradiol effect was inhibited by both tamoxifen as well as ag825 by 86% (p ⬍ 0.002) and 82% (p ⬍
0.002), respectively (fig. 3a). tamoxifen and ag825 did not
have any effect on tumor weight in the absence of estrogen
supplementation. inoculation of k179m-akt1- and r25cakt1-expressing mcf-7 cells into nude mice also decreased
tumor weight at the end of the experiment by 87% (p ⫽
0.0056) and 74% (p ⫽ 0.002), respectively, in estradiol supplemented mice, confirming a role for akt1.
similarly, ag825 was able to inhibit established tumors by
52% (p ⫽ 0.0438) and 46% (p ⬍ 0.0001), respectively, in cmvor myr-akt1-inoculated animals when compared with animals that received continued estrogen supplementation (fig.

these results corroborate with the data obtained for tumor
volumes at the end of each experiment (figs. 1, a, d, and e,
and 2) and further suggest that ag825 is as effective as
tamoxifen for inhibition of in vivo tumorigenesis in cmv
xenografts. in addition, in contrast to tamoxifen, ag825 was
also able to inhibit tumorigenesis in myr-akt1 xenografts.

ag825 (e2⫹ag825) (50 ␮g/d, ip injection). a and b, animals were

we next determined the effect of akt1 on in vivo tumorigenesis in intact animals. mcf-7 (empty vector or myr-akt1
transfected) cells were injected into intact mice. tumor formation was monitored for 101 d (fig. 4). in contrast to ovariectomized mice, in intact animals, tumor formation was observed after 30 d, even in the absence of estrogen
supplementation when animals were inoculated with myrakt1 cells (fig. 4b), suggesting that akt1 is tumorigenic in a
physiological estrogen environment, when the steroid hormones were not removed by ovariectomy. the increase in
tumor volume was 20-fold (p ⫽ 0.0049) in myr-akt1 xenografts when compared with cmv-injected intact animals. as
expected, in cmv-treated animals, estradiol supplementation also led to a similar increase in tumor volume with the
induction observed in ovariectomized animals inoculated
with the same cell transfectants [14-fold (p ⫽ 0.0275 increase
in tumor volume] (fig. 4a), and an even greater increase,
although not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.2125), was observed in myr-akt1-injected animals (fig. 4b).
regulation of akt, and erbb2 does not influence animal
toxicity and body weight

inoculation of dominant-negative akt1 mutant transfected
cells (k179m-akt1 and r25c-akt1) and ag825 administration were well tolerated by animals for the entire time of the
experiments and did not result in gross toxicity, such as
altered growth of the host or any drug- or cell line inoculation-related death. furthermore, no significant changes in
body weight gain between treatment groups or between
different cell transfectants were observed at the end of each
experiment (data not shown).

er-␣ expression in tumors is modulated by erbb2
and akt1

to determine the effect of ag825 on er-␣ expression in
tumors from animals inoculated with parental and cmvtransfected mcf-7 cells, immunohistochemical analyses
were performed in paraffin sections using an anti-er-␣ antibody (fig. 5). all tumors were carcinomas and expressed
er-␣, akt and erbb2. in both parental and empty vector
transfected xenograft tumors, estrogen treatment led to a
49% (p ⬍ 0.0005) and 51% (p ⫽ 0.0004) decrease in er-␣
expression. this effect was inhibited by 95% (p ⫽ 0.0055),
90% (p ⫽ 0.0299), and 80% (p ⫽ 0.00853), respectively, upon
tamoxifen, ag825, or r25c-akt1 treatment. in myr-akt1transfected xenograft tumors, er-␣ expression was inhibited
by 62% (p ⬍ 0.05). estradiol treatment did not further decrease er-␣ expression (63.3%, p ⬍ 0.05). whereas ag825
did not have any effect on er-␣ expression, it was able to

block the effect of estradiol, suggesting that myr-akt1 mimics the effect of estradiol in this xenograft model. these
results are similar to those obtained in our previous study in
vitro (26).
er-␣ activity in tumors is modulated by erbb2 and akt

to determine the effect of ag825 on er-␣ activity in tumors from animals inoculated with mcf-7 cells (stably transfected with cmv or akt1 mutants), immunohistochemical
analyses were performed in paraffin sections using an anti-pr antibody (fig. 6). staining intensity was categorized
into negative (⫺), weakly positive (⫹1), moderately positive
(2⫹), and strongly positive (ⱖ3⫹). the final score resulted
from the product of staining intensity and percentage of
stained cells and was compared with percent vehicle-treated
cells (percent control, c). erbb2 staining showed that tumors
had low erbb2 levels, similar to parental mcf-7 cells. in
tumors from cmv xenografts, pr expression was 55-fold
(p ⬍ 0.0005) elevated upon estrogen supplementation when
compared with no estrogen treatment. tamoxifen and
ag825 inhibited this effect by 89% (p ⫽ 0.0003) and 82% (p ⬍
0.0001), respectively. r25c also inhibited pr expression by
77% (p ⫽ 0.0038). these results suggest that er-␣ activity can
be modulated by akt1 and erbb2.

presence or absence of tamoxifen (tam) and ag825. mice were killed
after 52–104 d. tumors were kept in 10% formalin, and paraffin
sections from each tumor were prepared. immunohistochemical

as described in fig. 3.

to determine akt activity in the xenograft tumors, immunohistochemical analyses were performed using an antiphospho-akt antibody as well as an antitotal akt antibody
(fig. 6). akt was both localized in the cytoplasm and in the
nucleus. a statistically significant increase (5-fold) (p ⫽
0.0135) was observed for cytoplasmic pakt level in tumors
from estrogen supplemented cmv-inoculated ovariectomized nude mice when compared with nonsupplemented
animals. tamoxifen, ag825, and r25c-akt1 inhibited cytoplasmic pakt level by 48% (p ⫽ 0.0459), 66% (p ⫽ 0.0046), and
73% (p ⫽ 0.0089), respectively. although nuclear pakt levels

ovariectomized animals inoculated with mcf-7 cells (stably
transfected with cmv or myr-akt1) without or with an estradiol pellet in the presence or absence of ag825 were also
analyzed for akt phosphorylation and compared with the
parental cell line, mcf-7, nontreated or treated with estradiol
or heregulin-␤1 (hrg-␤1) (fig. 7a). similar to cells grown in
vitro, tumors growing in the presence of estradiol in cmvinoculated animals as well as myr-akt1 inoculated animals
without estradiol supplementation had high akt phosphorylation. this phosphorylation was significantly reduced
when animals received estradiol plus ag825, suggesting that
loss of akt phosphorylation was paralleled by inhibition of
tumor growth. in tumors from xenografts of mcf-7 cells
stably transfected with cmv, phosphorylation of akt was
accompanied by phosphorylation of erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx  (fig.
7b), and ag825 treatment also inhibited erbb2 and  xxxg722xxx 
phosphorylation. these results suggest that, similar to
mcf-7 cells in vitro (26), estradiol treatment results in dimerization and activation of the erbb2* xxxg722xxx  complex.
discussion

athymic female nude mice were used to investigate the
effects of the selective erbb2 inhibitor, ag825, and akt1
mutant-transfected cells (mcf-7-parental and stably transfected cells with empty vector, cmv; constitutively active
akt1, myr-akt1; and dominant-negative-akt1, k179m-akt1
and r25c-akt1) on in vivo growth. overall, ag825 treatment
and use of both dominant-negative akt1 mutant-transfected
cells inoculated into animals resulted in inhibition of tumor
growth (figs. 1– 4). the growth-inhibitory effects of ag825
and the dominant-negative akt1 mutant-transfected cells
correlated with decreased akt phosphorylation in tumors
(figs. 5 and 6), a decrease in pr expression (fig. 6), and an
increase in er-␣ expression (fig. 5). in intact animals without
estradiol supplementation but not in ovariectomized ones,

myr-akt1 promoted tumorigenesis (fig. 4). collectively,
these results reinforce the concept that cross talk among
estradiol, er-␣, and akt1 signaling occurs in vivo.
akt is a central effector of many signaling pathways in
breast cancer, involving er-␣, erbb2, and egfr (35–37).
akts are amplified in breast cancer (38) and have elevated
activity and/or expression [in er-negative breast cancers,
 xxxg120xxx  (42); mcf-7, akt1 (41), and 40 –94% of human tumors,
akt1 and  xxxg119xxx  (17, 43)]. high activity of akt in breast
cancer was associated with poor prognosis (43) and pathological phenotype (44), and hormone and chemotherapeutic
resistance (45). although expression of constitutively active
akt (t308d and s473d, akt-dd) interfered with normal
mammary gland development by attenuating apoptosis, tumors were not observed in transgenic mice carrying the
akt-dd transgene (46). however, coexpression of akt-dd
with a middle t antigen, decoupled from pi 3-k resulted in
a dramatic acceleration of mammary tumorigenesis (44). this
suggests that tumorigenesis requires the constitutive activation of other signaling pathways that are recruited by the
mutant polyoma virus middle t antigen, pyvmt, oncogene.
similarly, in our study, constitutively active akt (myr-akt1)
was not able to induce tumor formation in ovariectomized
animals without estrogen priming (fig. 1). these results are
also corroborated by other recent studies that suggested that
overexpression of akt1 was not enough to induce transformation or tumorigenesis (47). isografts of pdk1- or protein
kinase c␣-expressing comma-1d mouse mammary epithelial cells but not akt1-expressing cells in syngeneic mice
led to formation of poorly differentiated breast carcinomas.
moreover, constitutively active  xxxg120xxx - but not akt1-expressing mcf-7 cells produced tumors in ovariectomized
nude mice in the absence of estradiol with a reversal of
estrogen and tamoxifen response (48). however, in intact
animals, we were able to observe tumor growth when ani-

mals were inoculated with myr-akt1 cells in the absence of
estradiol treatment (fig. 4). these results are in agreement
with the findings reported by degraffenried et al. (49). they
have also shown that mcf-7 cells expressing myr-akt1 could
proliferate under reduced estrogen conditions, being resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of tamoxifen (49).
mammary gland-directed expression of either constitutively active or wild-type akt1 in transgenic animals has
failed to induce a malignant phenotype (38, 50, 51), suggesting that additional factors or signaling pathways are required for tumorigenesis. nevertheless, introduction of antisense  xxxg119xxx  or dominant-negative forms of akt1 can
inhibit mcf-7 (52) or zr75–1 (53) tumor formation in nude
mice. in our study, we demonstrate herein that both dominant-negative akt1 mutant (k179m-akt1 and r25c-akt1)containing mcf-7 cells, implanted into ovariectomized animals, blocked tumor formation. these results were also
confirmed by beliakoff et al. (54) using other akt inactive
mutants, t308a and s473a. they showed that the akt inhibitor geldamycin and its clinically relevant derivative, 17allyl amino-17-demethoxygeldamicin, led to inhibition of
mcf-7 and tamoxifen-resistant mcf-7 tumor xenografts in
severe combined immunodeficient mice. introduction of an
akt-kinase dead mutant directly into tumor cells can also

inhibit tumor formation in nude mice (52). however, these
effects were not observed in normal cells (53) or the mcf10
normal counterpart (52). thus, akt inhibition may not be
toxic to normal cells. in our study, we also did not observe
toxic effects or any significant changes in body weight gain
upon inoculation of mcf-7 cells stably transfected with dominant-negative akt1 mutants into nude mice. these results
suggest that akt is an integral component of the phenotypic
signaling during tumorigenesis and an important signaling
node that regulates many downstream effectors. therefore,
targeting the pi 3-k/akt1 pathway simultaneously with
er-␣ signaling may lead to inhibition of in vivo tumorigenesis
in not only hormone-dependent breast cancers but also hormone-resistant forms of this disease.
deregulation of erbb2 is also frequently associated with
aggressive clinical course of breast cancer, decreased diseasefree survival, poor prognosis, and development of hormone
independence as well as increased metastasis (48). treatment
with a combination of tamoxifen and an erbb2 kinase inhibitor, ag 1478, reduced tumor mapk activity in erbb2overexpressing mcf-7 xenografts in athymic mice (19).
these results suggest that inhibition of erbb2 and mapk
signaling may enhance tamoxifen action and abrogate antiestrogen resistance. similarly, we demonstrate in this study

lehnes et al. • effect of estradiol on in vivo tumorigenesis

that even in xenograft tumors from mcf-7 cells, which contain low concentrations of erbb2, a selective erbb2 inhibitor
was able to block in vivo tumorigenesis (figs. 1 and 4). in
addition, ag825 was also capable of inhibiting tumorigenesis when a constitutively active akt1 construct-transfected
mcf-7 cells were inoculated into ovariectomized nude mice.
therefore, ag825 is more effective than the antiestrogen
tamoxifen in these cells. moreover, ag825 significantly decreased akt phosphorylation in these tumors (figs. 6 and 7),
suggesting that erbb2 is coupled with akt1. our results
indicate that, in cells overexpressing myr-akt1, the membrane localization of constitutively active akt1 may permit
a direct interaction with erbb2 and membrane er-␣, as opposed to the known signaling of erbb2 via pi 3-k/akt under
conditions when myr-akt1 is not overexpressed (mcf-7 and
cmv transfected cells). these two different pathways may
either be alternative or concurrent, their balance depending
largely on cell conditions. in agreement with our findings,
mda-mb435 cells stably transfected to express a constitutively active erbb2 also led to increased akt phosphorylation
(55). whereas it is very clear that erbb2 can activate akt and
that akt activity is important for tumor growth, the ability
of ag825 to block growth of tumors containing myr-akt1
strongly suggests that other signaling pathways, independent of akt, could also be activated by erbb2.
we have previously shown that in mcf-7 cells, the blockade of erbb2, but not the egfr signaling, inhibits the effect
of estradiol on er-␣ expression and activity. our in vitro
results suggested that the nongenomic effects of estradiol are
coupled and/or synergize with its genomic effects (26). in
this study, we demonstrate that similar to our in vitro results,
the effect of estradiol on er-␣ expression and activity in
xenograft tumors, can be abrogated by the selective erbb2
inhibitor (figs. 5 and 6). ag825 inhibited er-␣ decrease and
pr induction. additionally, r25c-akt1 cells inoculated into
nude mice also inhibited pr expression (fig. 6), suggesting
that both erbb2 and akt1 can modulate er-␣ expression and
activity. our results show for the first time that the erbb2/pi
3-k/akt signaling pathway plays a major role in estrogenmediated signaling in vivo and that activation of this pathway
may therefore set the stage for later genomic actions of estradiol. in our model, the nongenomic estradiol effect may
complement and/or synergize with its genomic actions.
therefore, simultaneous interruption of the erbb2 and akt1
signaling pathways may enhance the inhibitory effects of
antiestrogens on both er-␣-mediated transcription and tumor cell proliferation.
