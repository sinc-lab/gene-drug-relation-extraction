1 negative inotropic eects of several b-adrenoceptor (bar) antagonists on electrically-stimulated
right atria, left atria, right ventricles and left ventricular papillary muscles from reserpine-treated rats
were used as a measure of their  xxxd1422xxx  activities.
2  xxxg91xxx  antagonists  xxxd58xxx , atenolol and metoprolol,  xxxg92xxx  antagonist ici-181,551 and
nonselective bar antagonists  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2689xxx , propranolol and  xxxd3377xxx  produced negative
inotropic eects, which were most marked on the right atria.
3 the nonselective bar antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  did not exhibit  xxxd1422xxx  activity but inhibited
the negative inotropic activities of ici-118,551, atenolol and propranolol.
4 the negative inotropic eects of lidocaine, nifedipine and pentobarbitone were similar on all the
four myocardial preparations.
5 the positive inotropic ecacy of salbutamol on right and left atria but not on right ventricles
and papillary muscles was comparable to that of  xxxd2398xxx . the antagonist activity of ici-118,551
against  xxxd2398xxx  was greater on right atria than on other cardiac regions.
6  xxxg91xxx  proteins were expressed in all regions of the heart but of  xxxg92xxx  were primarily localized in
the right atrium.
7 it is concluded that  xxxg92xxx  play a greater role in right atria than in other cardiac regions and
almost all bar antagonists behave as inverse agonists.

introduction
according to the two-state model of receptor activation (le,
1995), a fraction of total g protein-coupled receptors exist in
spontaneously active conformational state and can couple to g
protein in the absence of ligand (ehlert, 1986; lefkowitz et al.,
1993; bond et al., 1995; milligan et al., 1995). the inhibition of
the receptor-mediated functions by antagonists in the absence
of the agonist is de®ned as inverse agonism (ehlert, 1986). this
ligand-independent activity of g protein-linked receptors
(schutz & freissmuth, 1992) has been demonstrated for
benzodiazepine receptors (hunkeler et al., 1981; braestrup et
al., 1982; ehlert, 1986), bradykinin b2 receptors (leeblundberg et al., 1994), d opioid receptors (costa & herz,
1989), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (hilf & jakobs, 1992;
hanf et al., 1993), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (barker et
al., 1994; westphal & sanders-bush, 1994) as well as dierent
adrenoceptors (ar) such as  xxxg82xxx  (tian et al., 1994), bar
(gotze & jakobs, 1994),  xxxg91xxx  (mewes et al., 1993) and  xxxg92xxx 
(samama et al., 1994; chidiac et al., 1994; 1996; bond et al.,
1995).
 xxxg92xxx  selective antagonist ici-118,551 (bilski et al., 1983)
has been demonstrated to act as an  xxxd1422xxx  in
transgenic mice (bond et al., 1995) and cell lines (chidiac et
al., 1994; 1996; samama et al., 1994) overexpressing  xxxg92xxx .
several workers have reported dierences in the relative
densities of  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  in atrial and ventricular regions
of the heart (minneman et al., 1979; hedberg et al., 1980;
*author for correspondence; e-mail: dvarma@pharma.mcgill.ca

brodde et al., 1982; murphree & satz, 1988; brodde, 1991;
kitagawa et al., 1995) and in the positive inotropic activities of
dierent bar agonists (deng et al., 1997). it is thus possible
that the constitutive activities of  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  are not
uniform in dierent regions of the heart. in the present study
we determined negative inotropic responses of electricallystimulated left and sinus node-excised right atria as well as
right ventricular and left ventricular papillary muscle
preparations from reserpine-treated rats to  xxxg92xxx  selective
antagonist ici-181,551 (bilski et al., 1983) and a number of
 xxxg91xxx  selective and bar nonselective antagonists (homan &
lefkowitz, 1996); it was assumed that ligand-independent
 xxxd1422xxx  activity of bar antagonists should express as
negative inotropic response. data suggest that all bar
antagonists with the exception of  xxxd2957xxx  exert  xxxd1422xxx 
activity to varying degree, which is most prominent in the right
atria and virtually absent in the left ventricular tissue.

u.s.a. anti- xxxg91xxx  and anti- xxxg92xxx  antibodies were purchased
from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca, u.s.a.).
pentobarbitone and all other high purity chemicals were
purchased from  xxxg257xxx , montreal, qc, canada.

animals
male (350 ± 400 g) sprague-dawley rats (charles river, st.
constant, qc, canada) were used according to a protocol of
the mcgill university animal care committee. animals were
maintained at 238c, 50 ± 70% humidity and a 12 h light/dark
schedule (lights on 07.00 h ± 19.00 h) and fed ad libitum rat
chow and tap water. in order to deplete endogenous
catecholamines, 5 mg kg71 reserpine was injected intraperitoneally 24 h before animals were used for these studies. rats
were decapitated and hearts quickly excised and used for
dierent experiments.

negative inotropic responses
left atria, right atria (devoid of sinus node), a strip of the right
ventricle (4610 mm) and one left ventricular papillary muscle
from reserpine-treated rats were used to determine negative
inotropic responses. in some studies, right atria were divided
into two identical pieces one of which served as the control and
to the other was added 10 mm  xxxd2957xxx  30 min before
constructing negative inotropic response-curves to selected
bar antagonists. a small number of studies were also done on
tissues from non-reserpinized rats. the tension was recorded
by means of grass force-displacement transducers (ft03c) on
a grass polygraph (quincy, ma, u.s.a.). the preparations
were set up in tissue baths at 378c in krebs buer of the
following composition (mm): nacl 117, kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5,
 xxxd2534xxx  1.18, kh2po4 1.2, nahco3 25, dextrose 11 and
edta 0.03 (deng et al., 1997). the buer was gassed with a
mixture of 95% o2 and 5% co2. preparations were stimulated
at 1 hz, 5 ms pulse duration and 1.5 times the threshold
voltage (20 ± 30 v) and the tension was adjusted to yield
maximal basal contractions. preparations were allowed to
equilibrate for 1 h with changes in krebs buer every 15 min.

positive inotropic responses
right atria, left atria, right ventricle and left ventricular
papillary muscles were set up exactly as described above
except that the ca2+ concentration in the buer was 1.8
instead of 2.5 mm, the temperature of the bath was 32 instead
of 378c and rats were not treated with reserpine.
preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h with changes
in buer before constructing concentration-positive inotropic
response curves to  xxxd2398xxx  and salbutamol. in order to
determine the antagonist activity of ici-118,551 against
 xxxd2398xxx , left and right atria were divided into two and
two strips of right ventricles and two left ventricular papillary
muscles were set up; one preparation of each tissue served as
the control and to the other was added ici-118,551 (10, 100
and 1000 nm) 30 min before starting the construction of
concentration-positive inotropic response curves to  xxxd2398xxx .

western analysis of  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg91xxx 
right and left atria and ventricles were homogenized in icecold buer (ph 7.5) containing tris-hcl (10 mm), edta,
egta and  xxxd302xxx  (1 m each), 1 mg ml71 each of
leupeptin and soybean  xxxd207xxx  and phenylmethylsul-

inverse agonism

phonyl ¯uoride (pmsf) (0.2 mm). the supernatant following
homogenization at 3,0006g for 10 min was centrifuged at
100,0006g for 45 min; the membrane pellet was solubilized in
the above buer containing 1% tween 20 for 1 h on ice. the
solubilized proteins were quanti®ed by dye-binding method
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard. aliquots (300 mg)
of soluble proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min in
laemmli buer containing 10% b- xxxd26xxx  and
resolved on 8% sds ± page gels. the transfer of proteins
to membranes, the incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-bar
antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg
antibodies were done as previously described (peri et al., 1995).
the immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using a commercial kit (amersham, oakville, on,
canada).

data analysis and statistics
negative (denoting inverse agonism) and positive inotropic
potencies were calculated as pd2, which was the negative log of
ec50 (the molar concentration of the test agent causing 50% of
the maximal decrease or increase in eects). since bar
antagonists generally decreased the contractions of the left
atria, right ventricles and left ventricular papillary muscles less
than 30%, negative inotropic pd2 on these preparations was
not calculated. the antagonist potency of ici-118,551 was
calculated as pkb, the negative log of the dissociation constant
kb (molar concentration of the antagonist divided by the doseratio minus one) (besse & furchgott, 1976). multiple means
were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (anova)
followed by bonferroni test for signi®cance; two means were
compared by student's t-test for paired means. a probability
of less than 0.05 was assumed to denote a signi®cant dierence.
data are presented as means+s.e.mean.

results
basal contractions
the basal control contractions of the four sets of preparations
from reserpine-treated rats were signi®cantly dierent
(p50.05) from each other and were as follows: right atria,
644+28 mg (n=91); left atria, 552+28 mg (n=85); right
ventricles, 1004+60 mg (n=87); left ventricular papillary
muscles, 720+47 mg (n=90).

time-course of negative inotropic responses
negative inotropic eects were observed 1 ± 2 min after the
addition of eective concentrations of bar antagonists and
reached a plateau within 5 ± 10 min. the decrease in the
contractile force of all the four preparations following the
highest concentration (30 mm) of bar antagonists used could
not be reversed by repeated washes with fresh buer for at
least 60 min.

negative inotropic eects of lidocaine, nifedipine and
pentobarbitone
lidocaine (figure 1a), nifedipine (figure 1b) and pentobarbitone (figure 1c) caused concentration-dependent decreases in
the contraction of all myocardial preparations; there was no
signi®cant dierence in the negative inotropic eects of these
agents on the right atrial, left atrial, right ventricular and left
ventricular papillary muscle preparations.

d.r. varma et al

negative inotropic eects of ici-118,551
 xxxg92xxx  antagonist ici-118,551 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the basal contractions of right atrial
preparations; the negative inotropic eects of ici-118,551
were similar in preparations from non-reserpinized (figure 2a)
and reserpinized rats (figure 2b). the negative inotropic pd2
of ici-181,551 on right atria from non-reserpinized rats were,
respectively, 6.01+0.17 (n=8) and 6.08+0.18 (n=12). ici181, 551 produced minimal eects on the basal contractions of
left atria, right ventricles and papillary muscles from both
control and reserpine-treated rats (table 1).

reserpinized rats (figure 2d) were less than on preparations
from non-reserpinized animals (figure 2c). atenolol exerted
minimal negative inotropic eects on right ventricles and left
ventricular papillary muscles from both non-reserpinized and
reserpinized rats (figure 2c and d).
the negative inotropic potency and ecacy of metoprolol
were similar to those of atenolol; however, both atenolol and
metoprolol were more ecacious than  xxxd58xxx  (table 1).

negative inotropic eects of nonselective bar
antagonists
all nonselective bar antagonists studied ( xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2689xxx ,
 xxxd2957xxx , propranolol and  xxxd3377xxx ) with the exception of
 xxxd2957xxx  exhibited  xxxd1422xxx  activities; they caused a
greater decrease in the contractions of the right atria than of
the other three preparations (left atria, right ventricles and left
ventricular papillary muscles) (figure 3).  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2689xxx ,
propranolol and  xxxd3377xxx  caused signi®cantly greater decrease
in the basal contractions of the right atria than did  xxxd58xxx 
(table 1).

inhibition of negative inotropic eects of bar
antagonists by  xxxd2957xxx 
 xxxd2957xxx  produced minimal eects on the basal contractions of
right atria (figure 4a) and other cardiac regions (table 1).
however,  xxxd2957xxx  inhibited the negative inotropic eects of
ici-118,551 (figure 4b), atenolol (figure 4c) and propranolol
(figure 4d); this inhibitory eect of  xxxd2957xxx  appeared to be
less marked against  xxxg91xxx  antagonist atenolol than against
 xxxg92xxx  antagonist ici-118,551 and nonselective bar antagonist propranolol. eect of  xxxd2957xxx  on negative inotropic
responses to other bar antagonists and on other cardiac
regions was not studied.

positive inotropic eects of  xxxd2398xxx  and salbutamol
 xxxd2398xxx  produced concentration-dependent positive
inotropic eects on all the four myocardial preparations
studied; the rank order of potency and ecacy was: right
atria4left aria4right ventricle4left ventricular papillary
muscles (figure 5a). the ecacy of salbutamol on right
and left atria was comparable to that of  xxxd2398xxx ;
however, salbutamol exerted minimal positive inotropic
eects on right ventricles and left ventricular papillary
muscles (figure 5b).

experiments; all the four preparations in each experiment were from
the same animal.

ici-118,551 at a concentration of 100 nm antagonized the
positive inotropic eects of  xxxd2398xxx  on right atria (figure
6a) but exerted little eect on left atria (figure 6b), right
ventricles (figure 6c) and papillary muscles (figure 6d). the
pkb of ici-118,551 against  xxxd2398xxx  on right atria was
7.81+0.08 at 100 nm (n=7) and did not dier signi®cantly
from its pkb (7.78+0.21)  xxxd1891xxx  nm (data not shown). pd2
values of  xxxd2398xxx  in the absence and the presence of
100 nm ici-118,551 were, respectively, 7.21+0.27 and
7.22+0.21 on left atria, 7.13+0.3 and 7.04+0.26 on right
ventricles and 6.81+0.03 and 6.78+0.41 on left ventricular
papillary muscles; ici-118,551 did not cause a signi®cant
change in pd2 of  xxxd2398xxx  on these three preparations. at
relatively high concentration (1 mm), ici-118,551 inhibited the
eects of  xxxd2398xxx  on right and left atria as well as right

western analysis of bar
distinct band corresponding to  xxxg92xxx  at 47 kda region was
detected in right atrium and to a lesser extent in left atrium;
this 47 kda band could not be detected in right or left
ventricular tissue (figure 7a). in contrast  xxxg91xxx  proteins were

detected in both right and left atria and ventricles in greater
abundance than  xxxg92xxx  proteins (figure 7b).

1996) has been previously demonstrated. the primary
objective of this study was to determine if bar antagonists
exert  xxxd1422xxx  activity in native rat myocardium at
physiological concentrations of  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx . because an
activation of bar increases myocardial contractions, we
assumed that the inverse activity of bar antagonists would
express as negative inotropic response.
the present study revealed that dierent bar antagonists
with the exception of  xxxd2957xxx  exhibited  xxxd1422xxx 
activities; however they all produced greater negative inotropic
eects on the right atria than on other myocardial preparations
(left atria, right ventricles and left ventricular papillary
muscles). since nifedipine, lidocaine and pentobarbitone
caused comparable decreases in the contractions of the atrial
and ventricular preparations (figure 1), it would appear that
the dierences in the eects of bar antagonists on right atria
and other preparations re¯ect sensitivities of bar to inverse
agonist activities of dierent agents and not dierences in their
`quinidine-like' or `membrane-stabilizing' activities (homan
& lefkowitz, 1996). this inference is also supported by the
data that the nonselective bar antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  caused
little decrease in the basal contractions of all the four
myocardial preparations studied.
the negative inotropic eect of ici-118,551 was not
modi®ed by reserpine treatment (figure 2a and b) in
conformity with other reports (bond et al., 1995). it would
thus appear that  xxxg92xxx  in their native state are not under the

inverse agonism

in¯uence of endogenous catecholamines, as suggested by
others (bryan et al., 1981). moreover, endogenous catecholamines do not seem to equally modulate basal functions of
 xxxg91xxx  in dierent regions of the heart since the negative
inotropic eect of atenolol on right and left atria but not on
the ventricular preparations was decreased by reserpine
treatment (figure 2c and d). because myocardial preparations
from reserpine-treated rats were used as a measure of inverse
agonism, it could be assumed that the negative inotropic
responses of bar antagonists were minimally caused by
antagonizing the eects of endogenous catecholamines. this
inference is also supported by the data that nonselective bar
antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  exerted little negative inotropic eect
(figure 4a, table 1).
we studied  xxxg92xxx  selective antagonist ici-118,551 (bilski et
al., 1983),  xxxg91xxx  selective antagonists metoprolol, atenolol and
 xxxd58xxx , and nonselective bar antagonists  xxxd123xxx ,
 xxxd2689xxx ,  xxxd2957xxx , propranolol and  xxxd3377xxx  (homan &
lefkowitz, 1996). since both  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  antagonists
exerted negative inotropic eects, it would appear that both
 xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  are susceptible to  xxxd1422xxx  activity. the
®ndings that the  xxxd1422xxx  activities of bar antagonists
were greater on the right atria than on other preparations (left
atria, right ventricles, papillary muscles) suggest that the
constitutive activity of bar is tissue-speci®c. the greater
susceptibility of right atria than of other cardiac regions to
 xxxd1422xxx  activities of bar antagonists seems to be
related to relative distribution of  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  as well as to
a possible greater constitutive activity of  xxxg92xxx  than of  xxxg91xxx .
it has been reported that ici-118,551 did not decrease wholecell l-type calcium currents in guinea-pig ventricular
cardiomyocytes although both atenolol and propranolol
exhibited  xxxd1422xxx  activities (mewes et al., 1993); it is
very possible that a lack of  xxxd1422xxx  activity of ici-118,
551 in these ventricular cardiomyocyte preparations re¯ects
sparse expression of  xxxg92xxx .
studies using dierent regions of the myocardium from
humans (brodde, 1991), rabbits (brodde et al., 1982), cats
(hedberg et al., 1980), guinea-pigs (hedberg et al., 1980), rats
(hancock et al., 1979; minneman et al., 1979; kitagawa et al.,
1995) and dogs (murphree & satz, 1988) have consistently
demonstrated a much higher concentration of  xxxg91xxx  than of
 xxxg92xxx .  xxxg92xxx  constitute approximately 20% of the total in right
atria and are either undetectable (hedberg et al., 1980) or
expressed at much lower concentration in other regions
(brodde et al., 1982; kitagawa et al., 1995). in conformity
with these data, we found that  xxxg92xxx  protein was expressed
primarily in the right atria whereas  xxxg91xxx  proteins were
expressed in greater abundance in all myocardial regions
including the right atria (figure 7). a much greater positive
inotropic ecacy of salbutamol on right atria than on left atria
and minimal eects on right ventricles and papillary muscles
(figure 5) as well as a greater antagonist activity of ici118,551 against  xxxd2398xxx  on right atria than on left atria
and left ventricular papillary muscles (figure 6) also suggest a
greater functional role of  xxxg92xxx  on right atria than in other
cardiac regions of the rat. since the  xxxd1422xxx  ecacy of
 xxxg92xxx  antagonist ici-118,551 on right atria was comparable to
that of  xxxg91xxx  antagonists metoprolol and atenolol as well as
bar nonselective antagonist propranolol despite a relatively
lower concentration of  xxxg92xxx , it would appear that the relative
constitutive activity of  xxxg92xxx  exceeds that of  xxxg91xxx .
the reported  xxxd1422xxx  potency of ici-118,551 on
myocardial  xxxg92xxx  in transgenic mice (bond et al., 1995) and of
nonselective bar antagonists in cells overexpressing  xxxg92xxx 
(chidiac et al., 1994; 1996) is much higher than found in this

left ventricular papillary muscles (d) from non-reserpinized rats. two identical pieces of each tissue from the same rat were used; one
served as the control and to the other was added 100 nm ici-118,551, 30 min before starting the construction of concentrationresponse curves to  xxxd2398xxx . data are means+s.e.mean of 6 ± 8 separate experiments.

study. a possible explanation of this disparity in the inverse
agonist potencies might be related to much higher concentration of receptors following over expression than in native

tissues. furthermore, bond et al. (1995) found  xxxd123xxx  to
behave as a neutral antagonist in mouse myocardium
overexpressing  xxxg92xxx  although other workers (chidiac et al.,
1994) found that all bar antagonists tested ( xxxd123xxx ,
propranolol,  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxd2435xxx , dichloroisoprenaline) exhibited  xxxd1422xxx  activities. the data of this study
are in conformity with that reported for cells overexpressing
 xxxg92xxx  (chidiac et al., 1994). since the negative inotropic eect
of  xxxd123xxx  was comparable to that of ici-118,551,
propranolol and metoprolol, it would seem that  xxxd123xxx 
can act as an  xxxd1422xxx  at concentrations much higher
than those utilized by bond et al. (1995) in their studies.
in the present study using rats, on the other hand,  xxxd2957xxx 
was found to behave as a `neutral' antagonist. although
 xxxd2957xxx  exerted little negative inotropic eect, it signi®cantly
reduced the  xxxd1422xxx  activities of  xxxg92xxx  antagonist ici118,551,  xxxg91xxx  antagonist atenolol and nonselective bar
antagonist propranolol (figure 4); these data also suggest that
the negative inotropic activity of ici-118,551, atenolol and
propranolol and possibly of other bar antagonists re¯ects
 xxxd1422xxx  activities of these agents rather than an
antagonism of endogenous ligands.
in summary, data of this study provide evidence for an
 xxxd1422xxx  activity of bar antagonists in native
myocardial tissues. since the negative inotropic activities of
dierent bar antagonists considerably vary in dierent
cardiac regions but are present even after the depletion of
endogenous catecholamines, it would appear that myocardial

depression following clinical use of these agents might in part
re¯ect their  xxxd1422xxx  activities; the magnitude of this
depressant eect might vary in dierent cardiac regions
depending upon bar concentrations. the data of this study
do not elaborate on the `two-state' model of receptor
activation (le, 1995) but are consistent with this hypothesis

inverse agonism

and provide additional evidence for constitutive activity of
bar receptors in native cardiac tissues.

this study was supported by a grant from the quebec heart and
stroke foundation.
