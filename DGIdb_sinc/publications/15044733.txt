abstract
the flavin enzyme  xxxg633xxx  (dhod; ec 1.3.99.11) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to  xxxd2794xxx , the fourth step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis of ump. the enzyme is a
promising target for drug design in different biological and clinical applications for cancer and arthritis. the
first crystal structure of the class 2  xxxg633xxx  from rat has been determined in complex
with its two inhibitors  xxxd363xxx  and  xxxd243xxx . these inhibitors have shown promising results as antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, and antiparasitic agents. a unique feature of the class 2 dhods is their
n-terminal extension, which folds into a separate domain comprising two ␣-helices. this domain serves as
the binding site for the two inhibitors and the respiratory quinones acting as the second substrate for the class
2 dhods. the orientation of the first n-terminal helix is very different in the two complexes of rat dhod
(dhodr). binding of  xxxd243xxx  causes a 12 å movement of the first residue in the first ␣-helix. based
on the information from the two structures of dhodr, a model for binding of the quinone and the residues
important for the interactions could be defined. his 56 and arg 136, which are fully conserved in all class
2 dhods, seem to play a key role in the interaction with the electron acceptor. the differences between the
membrane-bound rat dhod and membrane-associated class 2 dhods exemplified by the escherichia coli
dhod has been investigated by grid computations of the hydrophobic probes predicted to interact with
the membrane.

dihydrorotate dehydrogenase (dhod) (ec 1.3.99.11) catalyzes the fourth step and only redox reaction in the de novo
pyrimidine biosynthesis, the stereospecific oxidation of (s)dho to  xxxd2794xxx  accompanied by the reduction of the prosthetic flavin (fmn) group (fig. 1). a phylogenetic analysis
of available dhod sequences revealed that dhod from
different organisms can be assigned to two different major
classes: class 1 and class 2 (björnberg et al. 1997). class 1
dhods originating mainly from gram-positive bacteria can
furthermore be divided into subclasses 1a, 1b, and a new
type 1s identified in sulfolobus solfataricus (sørensen and
dandanell 2002). the dhods belonging to the different
classes differ also in their location in the cell. the class 1a
and 1b dhods are found in the cytosol, whereas those
from class 2 are membrane associated. another distinct difference between the two classes of enzymes is their natural
electron acceptor used to reoxidize the flavin group.
lactococcus lactis contains two genes encoding for
dhods representing subclass 1a and 1b, dhoda and
dhodb, respectively. they differ in their structural organization and use of electron acceptor. the dhoda enzyme
is a homodimer comprising two pyrda subunits with an
(␣␤)8 barrel fold and the prosthetic fmn group located at

the c-terminal ends of the ␤-strands at the top of the barrel
(rowland et al. 1997); it uses fumarate as its natural electron acceptor (andersen et al. 1996). the dhodb is a
heterotetramer composed of a central homodimer of pyrdb
subunits resembling the dhoda structure and two pyrk
subunits (rowland et al. 2000). it is the presence of the
pyrk subunits, which contain an fad group and a [2fe-2s]
cluster, that enables the class 1b enzymes to use nad+ as
the natural electron acceptor (nielsen et al. 1996). class 1s
dhod can use q0 and molecular oxygen as electron acceptors, together with the unphysiological substrates ferricyanide and dcip used in in vitro measurements (sørensen
and dandanell 2002).
the membrane-associated class 2 dhods found in gramnegative bacteria and in eukaryotes are monomeric enzymes
that have the respiratory quinones as their physiological
electron acceptors (fig. 1; björnberg et al. 1999). a major
structural difference between the class 1 and class 2 dhods
is their extended n terminus. the structure determinations
for the dhodc and  xxxg633xxx , truncated to be of the same
length as dhodc, showed that the n terminus in the class
2 enzymes comprises a separate domain with two ␣-helices
located on the top of the catalytic (␣␤)8 barrel close to the
fmn group (liu et al. 2000; nørager et al. 2002). all
eukaryotic enzymes from class 2 are located in the mitochondrial membrane attached by transmembrane ␣-helices,
whereas the gram-negative bacterial enzymes are associated
with the cytosolic side of the outer membrane. the extension of the n terminus in class 2 dhods is thought to serve
as a targeting signal guiding the enzyme to its location in the
inner mitochondrial membrane (rawls et al. 2000; löffler et
al. 2002)
a basic residue in the active site mediates the stereospecific oxidation of (s)-dho. it is a cysteine in the class 1
enzymes (björnberg et al. 1997) and a serine residue in the
class 2 dhods (björnberg et al. 1999). the basic residue is
located in a loop in close contact to dho bound on top of
the fmn group. this position facilitates abstraction of a
proton from the c5 atom of dho in the enzymatic reaction,
where a double bond between c5 and c6 is formed due to
the transfer of a hydride ion from c6 to the n5 atom of
fmn (fig. 1). the second half reaction uses the respiratory
quinones as electron acceptors. their proposed binding site
(liu et al. 2000) is the n-terminal domain, where they are
able to mediate the electron transfer to the fmnh2 group
bound in the (␣␤) 8 barrel, as shown in figure 1.
the inhibition of dhods causes a lowering of the intracellular pools of uracil, cytosine, and thymine nucleotides in
cells, which makes dhods attractive drug targets (fairbanks et al. 1995). most organisms are able to use a salvage
pathway for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. it allows
the pyrimidine bases or nucleosides formed from degradation of nucleotides and nucleic acids to be reused by salvage
reactions. some of the genes encoding for the enzymes in

 xxxg633xxx  from rat

the pyrimidine salvage pathway were not identified in the
genomes of two organisms affecting human health, the bacterium helicobacter pylori causing stomach ulcers and
stomach cancer and the malaria-causing parasite plasmodium. they therefore depend exclusively on de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, which explains why
dhods from these organisms are very attractive drug targets.
rapidly dividing human cells, like activated lymphocytes (cutolo et al. 2003) and cancer cells (shawver et al. 1997) require
also a functional de novo nucleotide pathway to meet their
requirement for nucleotides because recycling using salvage
pathways of the already existing nucleotide pool through salvage pathways is not sufficient (fairbanks et al. 1995).
the immunomodulating drug  xxxd2450xxx  (arava) has
been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
(goldenberg 1999). it has been shown that this drug inhibits
 xxxg633xxx  and thereby inhibits the pyrimidine de novo biosynthetic pathway (davis et al. 1996). the structure of
 xxxg633xxx  is known in complex with a771726, the active
metabolite of the prodrug  xxxd2450xxx  ( xxxg633xxx -lefl) and
 xxxd363xxx  ( xxxg633xxx -breq) (liu et al. 2000). from the analysis of the two structures of  xxxg633xxx , it was concluded that
the inhibitors could bind to the same site as the second
natural substrate, the respiratory quinone. this feature was
also deduced from enzyme kinetics studies of most of the
class 2 enzyme inhibitors reported so far (bader et al. 1998;
knecht et al. 2000). considerable efforts have been put into
structure activity analysis for dhods from different organisms, among them rat and mouse (knecht et al. 2000).
an interesting feature of class 2 dhods is the relatively
small number of conserved residues located in their extended n termini. this explains why the n-terminal domains in the known structures of the class 2 dhods display
significant variations in the length and orientation of the
helices that form this domain (nørager et al. 2002). the
comparison of the sequences from  xxxg633xxx , dhodc, and
dhodr in figure 2 reveals that, among the residues corresponding to the first 40 residues of dhodc, there are
only six conserved. it is likely that this variation is the origin
of the different behavior of inhibitors even for very closely
related dhods like the rat and human (knecht and löffler
1998). thus, it seems possible to design inhibitors that are
specific for a given organism, as demonstrated by structureactivity studies made on class 2 dhods (copeland et al.
2000).
the work presented here addresses the differences between the class 2 dhods. we have determined the crystal
structures of the dhod from rat, truncated like  xxxg633xxx  to
be of the same length as dhodc, in complex with  xxxd363xxx  (dhodr-breq) and  xxxd243xxx  (dhodr-ato).  xxxd243xxx  (fig. 1) is a structural analog of ubiquinone. it is used
as a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug and has showed activity against various parasitic infections, such as malaria,
toxoplasmosis (caused by toxoplasma gondii), and pneu-

monia (pneumocystis carinii) (kaneshiro et al. 2000).
 xxxd243xxx  has passed clinical trials and thereby received
approval to combat plasmodium falciparum. the primary
mechanism of action in plasmodium falciparum is the irreversible binding to the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex, but it is also a potent inhibitor of dhod activity
(ittarat et al. 1994).  xxxd243xxx  is marketed in the united
states under the trade name  xxxd243xxx .  xxxd243xxx  is one of
the active compounds in malarone (glaxosmithkline), used
in the prophylaxis (prevention) and treatment of malaria.
 xxxd363xxx  is a quinoline carboxylic acid, which has been
tested preclinically as a cytostatic agent.
the three inhibitors  xxxd243xxx , a77126, and  xxxd363xxx 
(known to inhibit different class 2 dhods) are chemically
different and do not mimic the natural electron acceptor, as
shown in figure 1. our analysis of the two structures of
dhodr-ato and dhodr-breq revealed a remarkable difference in the conformation of their small n-terminal domain. a comparison to the structures of inhibited  xxxg633xxx 
have revealed subtle differences in the n-terminal domain
that can explain why the dhod inhibitors act differently on
the two highly homologous enzymes. these results are
valuable for the structural-based drug design of organismspecific inhibitors of dhod, and have formed the basis for
a modeling of quinone binding. furthermore, we present an
analysis of the differences in the n-terminal domain between the class 2 membrane-bound and membrane-associated dhod, based on computational grid modeling.
results and discussion
the structures of dhodr
the structures of the truncated dhodr complexed with
 xxxd363xxx  (dhodr-breq) and  xxxd243xxx  (dhodr-ato)
have been determined to 2.4 å and 2.3 å resolution, respectively. overall pictures of the two structures are presented in figure 3, a and b. dhodr-ato comprises two
independent but identical complexes. superimposition calculated with default values in the program o (jones et al.
1991) shows an rmsd of 0.14 å for 358 c␣ atoms. like the
other known class 2 dhod structures, dhodr is a monomer, which folds into a small n-terminal domain and an
(␣␤)8 barrel comprising the larger c-terminal domain. the
smaller n-terminal domain contains the two ␣-helices (␣a
and ␣b). a remarkable difference is noted between the
dhodr-ato and dhodr-breq structures with respect to
the orientation of the ␣a-helix, which adopts very different
positions in the two structures (fig. 3a,b). the similarity
between the two dhodr-ato complexes in the asymmetric
unit and the absence of close (<3.9 å) crystal contacts make
it unlikely that the difference between the two dhodr
structures is due to crystal-packing effects. superimposition
of the two structures in two different orientations is shown
in figure 3c. using the position of the n-terminal tyr 38

and  xxxg633xxx -lefl. the overall fold of dhodr-breq is very
similar to the fold observed in these three structures,
whereas the dhodr-ato displays a unique orientation of
the n-terminal ␣〈-helix. superposition of dhodr-breq
and  xxxg633xxx -breq using default values in the program o
(jones et al. 1991) gives rmsd values of 0.536 å for 339 c␣
atoms. the inhibitors in the dhod structures bind in the
same location, between the two n-terminal helices ␣a and
␣b suggested as the binding site for the natural quinone
substrate (liu et al. 2000). this binding site is empty in
dhodc, which was determined without any inhibitors. the
n-terminal domain of dhodc differs from the other
dhod structures by having a distinct kink in the ␣b-helix,
with the last part comprising a 310 helix (nørager et al.
2002).

did not reveal any significant differences; thus, the different
orientation of the ␣a-helix in dhodr-ato does not represent a more solvent-exposed structure.
two n-terminal ␣-helices, ␣a and ␣b, form a hydrophobic entrance to the fmn group located on the top of the
(␣␤)8 barrel.  xxxd2794xxx  is bound as in the complexes of the
class 1a and 1b enzymes with the ring system stacked at the
si-face of fmn (rowland et al. 1998, 2000). the presence of
bound cations in dhodr-breq and a detergent molecule,
␤-octylglucoside, in dhodr-ato can be attributed to the difference in crystallization conditions. the cations are located
far from the substrate and inhibitor binding sites, and the detergent molecule is localized parallel to ␣1- and ␣2-helices of
the (␣␤)8 barrel. the flexible loop with many conserved residues covering the active site is poorly defined in the electron
densities of the dhodr structures. the disorder of this loop
has the implication that asn 217–leu 224 and pro 216–leu
224 could not be traced in the electron density maps for
dhodr-breq and dhodr-ato, respectively.
comparison to the structures of other class 2 dhods
the structures of dhodr-ato and dhodr-breq were
compared with the structures of dhodc,  xxxg633xxx -breq,

the overall binding of  xxxd363xxx  in dhodr-breq is illustrated in figure 3a and in more detail in figure 4a.  xxxd363xxx  interacts with residues coming from the helices of the
n-terminal helix, the loop connecting the two domains, ␤c,
one of the additional ␤ strands in the (␣␤)8 barrel, and the
first residue of ␣8. the carboxylate group of  xxxd363xxx 
forms a hydrogen-bonded ring system with arg 136. the
hydrophobic moiety of  xxxd363xxx  is in contact with met 43,
ala 59, leu 68, pro 364, ala 55, leu 46, and ile 360. the
stacking interactions between the fluorosubstituted quinoline ring system and the imidazole ring of his 56 seems also
to be important for the  xxxd363xxx  binding (fig. 4a).  xxxd363xxx  binding in dhodr-breq resembles the binding of
 xxxd363xxx  in  xxxg633xxx , but the ic50-value of  xxxd363xxx  is
127 nm for dhodr and 6 nm for  xxxg633xxx  (ullrich et al.
2001). to explain this significant difference in inhibition,
we made a superimposition of the n-terminal domains of
dhodr and  xxxg633xxx . the binding of  xxxd363xxx  is alike in
the two dhods; however, phe 62 in the  xxxg633xxx  (replaced
with val 62 in the dhodr) could give a better interaction
with the aromatic ring, explaining why  xxxd363xxx  binds
more strongly to  xxxg633xxx . the aromatic ring in phe 62 is
almost perpendicular to the fluoro substituted part of the
quinoline ring system of  xxxd363xxx .
 xxxd243xxx  binding in dhodr
 xxxd243xxx  also displays pronounced differences with respect to inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  and dhodr: the ic50 value
is 14,500 nm for  xxxg633xxx  and 698 nm for dhodr
(knecht et al. 2000). a detailed structural picture of the
binding of  xxxd243xxx  in dhodr is presented in figure
4b.  xxxd243xxx  interacts with residues from the same sequence regions as  xxxd363xxx . the interactions to the pyrrolidone rings of pro 44 and pro 364, which stack with the
para-chloro phenyl group seem also to be significant. there

are other hydrophobic interactions between  xxxd243xxx  and
his 56, tyr 356, val 134, ile 360, ala 55, gln 47, and met
43. arg 136 is essential for the binding of  xxxd243xxx . it
forms a hydrogen-bonded ring system with the hydroxy and
one of the carbonyl groups of the fused ring system resembling the one involving the carboxylate group of  xxxd363xxx .
the side chain of arg 136 adopts quite different conformations in the two dhodr structures, as illustrated by the
differences in the chi and  xxxg444xxx  torsion angles as calculated with o (jones et al. 1991). they are −61° and 175° in
the  xxxd243xxx  complex compared with −157° and −57° in
the  xxxd363xxx  complex. the hydrogen bonds between  xxxd243xxx  and arg 136 open an opportunity for interactions
between the first residue glu 40 in ␣-helix 1 and the chloro
atom in  xxxd243xxx . a comparison of this region in
dhodr-breq and dhodr-ato reveals that if the n-terminal ␣a-helix is positioned like that in the  xxxd363xxx  structure, it would lead to clashes between the p-chloro-phenyl
group and glu 40. the movement of the ␣〈-helix enables
the formation of a hydrogen bond between the side chain of
gln 47 (ne2) and the backbone carbonyl group of ile 360,
an interaction that can contribute to the stabilization of the
orientation of the ␣a-helix in the dhodr-ato structure.
superimposition of the c␣ atoms of the two rat structures
(fig. 3c) reveals that  xxxd243xxx  is bent toward ␣-helix 1.
 xxxd243xxx  appears more deeply buried in the tunnel compared with  xxxd363xxx  and therefore closer to fmn. interestingly, kinetic experiments with the dhodr (knecht et al.
2000) showed that both  xxxd243xxx  and  xxxd363xxx  are uncompetitive inhibitors with respect to dihydroorotate. however,  xxxd243xxx  was found to be a competitive inhibitor
with respect to the ubiquinone substrate qd,, whereas  xxxd363xxx  did not show pure competitive inhibition with respect
to qd. its noncompetition of dhodr could be identified as
a “mixed-type”inhibition (copeland 2000; knecht et al.
2000). on the basis of kinetic investigations, it was proposed that though the two inhibitors bind to the same qd
binding site, they have different interactions with the enzyme. the naphthoqinone ring system makes  xxxd243xxx 
structurally more similar to qd than  xxxd363xxx  (fig. 1). the
fact that it functions as a competitive inhibitor against the
electron acceptor confirms that it is bound at the same site.
inhibitor binding in different dhods
whereas  xxxd2450xxx ’s active metabolite a771726 and  xxxd363xxx  (fig. 1) inhibit  xxxg633xxx  and dhodr, they do not
inhibit dhodc (k.f. jensen, unpubl.). from the  xxxg633xxx -

breq and  xxxg633xxx -lefl structures, the following residues
were identified as interacting with the inhibitors: gln 47,
arg 136, his 56, tyr 356, thr 360, and met 43, ala 59, leu
68, pro 364 (liu et al. 2000). a structural-based sequence
comparison of the  xxxg633xxx , dhodr, and dhodc (fig. 2)
reveals that only four of these nine residues are conserved in
the three organisms: arg 136, his 56, tyr 356, and pro 364,
noting that only his 56 is located in the n-terminal domain.
this could explain why inhibition patterns of the three enzymes dhodc, dhodr, and  xxxg633xxx  are significantly
different.
the empty n-terminal domain of dhodc is depicted in
figure 4d. from the comparison to the  xxxg633xxx  structure
(nørager et al. 2002), the following residues in the n-terminal domain were identified as being of potential significance for the difference between the two enzymes in inhibitor binding: met 43, gln47, and ala59, which are all conserved in dhodr and  xxxg633xxx  but lacking in dhodc. in
addition, val 134 can play a role for the differences in
inhibition as this is replaced by a leucine in dhodc.

inhibition studies
the structures were determined for the truncated histidinetagged enzyme. in order to examine how far the n-terminal
truncation influenced the biological function, the efficacy of
 xxxd243xxx  and  xxxd363xxx  with truncated dhodr was
evaluated from dose-response curves with the inhibitor and
compared with that observed with the full-length enzyme.
because ic50 values (inhibitor concentration giving 50%
inhibition) of a particular inhibitor can change with changing solution conditions (copeland 2000), the values were
determined under the same standardized assay conditions as
previously applied for the full-length enzyme (knecht et al.
2000; ullrich et al 2002).
the ic50 values as obtained from dose-response curves
are presented in table 1 with those determined with the
full-length dhodr for comparison. both versions of the rat
enzyme are more sensitive to  xxxd363xxx  than  xxxd243xxx .
the difference of drug efficiency between the truncated and
the full-length enzyme could indicate that access to the
binding site to a certain extent is influenced by the n terminus. interestingly, the difference observed here for the
quinone analogs  xxxd243xxx  and  xxxd363xxx  was not detected
with the isoxazole class of malonnitrilamide compounds,
a771726, mna 279, and mna 715. these revealed fairly
identical ic50 values when comparisons between the full-

length and truncated dhodr were made (knecht and löffler 1998; ullrich et al. 2001).
the role of the n-terminal extension of class 2 dhods
class 2 dhods are all associated with membranes and have
an extended n terminus compared with the class 1 dhods.
dhodc possesses one of the shortest extensions, and the
eukaryotic dhods that have been subject to structure determination (liu et al. 2000 and this work) have had ∼30 of
their first amino acids removed to have the same length as
dhodc. the succeeding residues (the first of dhodc)
fold into the n-terminal domain that is the binding site for
the second substrate and the inhibitors as discussed earlier.
the question remains on the biological function of the first
n-terminal amino acids in the eukaryotic dhods. a probable function of these residues is to contribute to the membrane attachment through a transmembrane ␣-helix (tm in
fig. 2), but also to provide a mitochondrial targeting signal
(rawls et al. 2000; löffler et al. 2002). from the cdna of
rat liver dhod, a typical sequence of 10 amino acid residues corresponding to a targeting signal and a hydrophobic
stretch of 18 amino acids (residues 12–29) corresponding to
the transmembrane ␣-helix could be identified (knecht et al.
1996).
dhodc does not possess a transmembrane ␣-helix, but
it is still associated with the membrane. in order to investigate if the difference in membrane association between the
dhods from gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes is related to differences in the hydrophobic character of their
surface, we used the program grid (goodford 1985) to
calculate hydrophobic contour surfaces for the two different
types of dhods. dhodc was used as a prototype for
dhods from gram-negative bacteria, and we constructed a
model of the eukaryotic dhods that includes the residues
that connect the first ␣a-helix and the tm-helix. the residues 30–38 from the  xxxg633xxx -breq (pdb accession number
1d3g) were used for the structural modeling because all of
1038

protein science, vol. 13

the residues in helix ␣a are present in this structure. the
hydrophobic contour surfaces calculated for this chimerical
dhodr and dhodc are depicted in figure 5, a–d. the
hydrophobic area covered by the n-terminal ␣-helices is
larger in dhodc than in dhodr. this could be one of the
reasons why the eukaryotic dhods require a transmembrane helix for attachment. in fact, a mutant of dhodr
lacking the transmembrane helix was shown to be translocated into the mitochondrial matrix rather than to be inserted into the inner membrane (rawls et al. 2000). the
residues that contribute mostly to the hydrophobic surface
in dhodc are the aromatic residues tyr 2, phe 5, phe 21,
and pro 4. other contributing residues are glu 20 and the
chain of arg 17, arg 28, lys 8 (∼fig. 5c,d). it is also the
aromatic residues in dhodr that make the largest contribution to the hydrophobic contour surfaces, namely, tyr 41
and phe 37. contribution to the hydrophobic contour surfaces in dhodr comes also from val 62, leu 49, leu 50,
arg 48, and arg 70 (fig. 5a,b). these grid calculations
also provide an estimate of the hydrophobic binding capacity of the small n-terminal domain, which is −12.91 kcal/
mole for dhodr and −10.46 kcal/mole for dhodc. this
corresponds to a very small difference in the binding constant for dhodr and dhodc. however, the binding capacity is distributed over a larger area in dhodc compared
with dhodr, which could give the dhodc a better interaction with the membrane.
substrate binding in class 2 dhods
his 56 and arg 136 are the only fully conserved residues
that interact with the inhibitors of the class 2 dhods. this
could indicate that they also play a role in binding of the
electron acceptor. arg 136 contributes to the binding of
 xxxd243xxx  and  xxxd363xxx  in dhodr by making hydrogen
bonds to the inhibitors and adopting different conformations
of the side chain. in order to get a picture of the binding of
the natural substrate, we used autodocking (version 3.0.3)
from the scripps research institute and molecular graphics
laboratory to dock a quinone into the binding pocket of
dhodr. the result of this modeling is depicted in figure
4c. accommodation of the quinone into the pocket can take
place in a similar way as for  xxxd363xxx  and  xxxd243xxx ,
exploiting the flexibility of arg 136, meaning that arg 136
can adopt its conformation to the chemical nature of the
compound bound in the pocket, in this case making tight
interactions with the c3 bound carbonyl group. as seen for
the inhibitors, his 56 stacks with the quinone ring system.
the significance of this residue in the substrate recognition
is supported by earlier work by davis and copeland (1997).
they showed that replacing his 56 by alanine cause a 10fold reduction in catalytic activity relative to the wild-type
 xxxg633xxx  and that the mutant h56a was 167-fold less sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd363xxx . these results support our
hypothesis that his 56 and arg 136 are important for bind-

materials and methods
protein preparation
recombinant dhodr was expressed in e. coli and purified as a
truncated protein where the first 29 amino acids in the n terminal
are removed, as described previously (ullrich et al. 2001).  xxxd243xxx  was obtained from the wellcome foundation and  xxxd363xxx 
from dupont pharma gmbh.

crystallization
initial searches for crystallization conditions were performed using
crystal screen 1 and 2 from hampton research (jancarik and kim
1991) using the vapor diffusion method. protein solutions of 15
mg/ml protein, 2 mm  xxxd2794xxx , 0.1% ␤-octylglucoside, and inhibitor in a concentration of 0.1 mm and 1 mm for  xxxd243xxx  and
 xxxd363xxx , respectively, were used. hanging or sitting drops of

2-␮l protein solution and 2-␮l reservoir solutions were equilibrated over 500-␮l reservoir or 1-ml reservoir solution at room
temperature.
in the presence of  xxxd243xxx , small yellow crystals (dhodrato) appeared after 3 d in crystal screen 1, solution 39 (2% peg
400 and 2 m ammonium sulphate, 0.1 m hepes-na at ph 7.5).
optimization of this condition gave large reproducible crystals (0.2
mm × 0.3 mm) grown with the following composition of the reservoir solution 5% peg 400, 1.9 m ammonium sulphate, and 0.1
m tris-hcl buffer (ph 8.6). crystals of dhodr-breq were found
in two conditions, solution 40 from crystal screen 1 (20% 2- xxxd3026xxx , 20% peg 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate at ph 5.6) and solution 35 from crystal screen i (70% mpd, 0.1 m hepes at ph
7.5). crystals used for data collection were grown as yellow thin
needles over a period of 15 d with a reservoir solution consisting
of 65% mpd, 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.5).

data collection
diffraction data for dhodr-ato were collected to 2.3 å resolution
at beamline bw7a, embl, hamburg, germany, using a ccd
detector from mar research. prior to data collection, at 100k the
crystals were transferred to cryo protectant (2 m ammonium sulphate, 20% peg 400, and 0.1 m tris-hcl at ph 8.5) and flash-

59%. a data set to 2.4 å resolution was collected for dhodrbreq at beamline i711 (max lab, lund, sweden) on a crystal
cooled to 100k. these crystals belong to space group  xxxd2372xxx 
(a ⳱ 49.8 å, b ⳱ 95.8 å, c ⳱ 144.5 å) and have one molecule in
the asymmetric unit with a corresponding water content of 39%.
auto indexing, data reduction, and scaling were performed with
programs from the hkl suite (otwinowski and minor 1997). details of data collection and statistics are summarized in table 2.

structure determination and refinement
the structure of dhodr-breq was determined by molecular replacement using epmr (kissinger et al. 1999). the crystal structure of  xxxg633xxx -breq (pdb accession number 1d3g), sharing
88% sequence identity with dhodr, was used as search model. a
correlation coefficient of 60.5% and an r-factor of 40.2% were
obtained for the correct solution. the nonconserved residues in the
model were changed to alanine residues using o (jones et al. 1991)
and this model was used in a rigid body refinement, performed
with cns (brunger et al. 1998). the difference electron density
map showed clear density for  xxxd2794xxx ,  xxxd363xxx , and fmn. these
three molecules were incorporated in the model that was built
using o (jones et al. 1991) and a simulated annealing refinement
was performed with cns (brunger et al. 1998). a few rounds of
model building with o (jones et al. 1991) and refinement with
cns (brunger et al. 1998) revealed two distinct peaks in the
electron density, which from their peak height and surroundings
were interpreted as a sodium ion and a nickel ion, the latter coming
from the purification of dhodr on ni-column. both ions are
located far from the active and the inhibitor binding sites. these
ions were introduced in the model, b-factors were refined, and

1040

protein science, vol. 13

water molecules were added automatically in cns (brunger et al.
1998) at a peak height above 3.0 ␴ in the fobs-fcalc electron density
map and above 1.5 ␴ in the 2fobs-fcalc electron density map, with
at least one hydrogen bond between water and any atom in the
protein, and a b-factor below 50 å2. the final model has an
r-factor of 21.0% (r-free 26.3%) and contains 351 amino acid
residues, one  xxxd2794xxx  molecule, one fmn molecule, one  xxxd363xxx ,
one sodium ion, one nickel ion, and 41 water molecules.
the refined model of dhodr-breq was used as a search model
in molecular replacement with the dhodr-ato diffraction data
using epmr (kissinger et al. 1999). the correct solution had a
correlation coefficient of 61.5% and an r-factor of 38.5% and
confirmed the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit.
 xxxd2794xxx , fmn, and  xxxd243xxx  were easily identified in the electron density map and these molecules were added to the model
using o (jones et al. 1991). a major movement of the n-terminal
helix was discovered. after cycles of refinement in cns (brunger
et al. 1998) and model building in o (jones et al. 1991), these
amino acid residues could be placed in agreement with the electron
density map. moreover, as refinement progressed, a ␤-octylglucoside molecule was identified bound to each molecule parallel to the
␣1- and ␣2-helices in (␣␤)8 barrel. b-factors were refined and
water molecules added as described earlier. the final model has an
r-factor of 21.6% (r-free 24.2%). both molecules in the asymmetric unit contain 358 amino acid residues, one  xxxd2794xxx  molecule,
one fmn molecule, one  xxxd243xxx  molecule, and one ␤-octylglucoside molecule, in addition to the 208 water molecules. a
summary of refinement statistics for the two structures is shown in
table 2.
the quality of the structural models was evaluated with
procheck (laskowski et al. 1993). dhodr-breq has 93.2%,
and both chain a and chain b of dhodr-ato have 90.8% of the
residues located in the most favored regions in the ramachandran
plot. the additionally allowed regions contain 6.2% of the residues
in dhodr-breq and 8.9% of the residues in dhodr-ato (both

 xxxg633xxx  from rat

chain a and chain b). the generously allowed region contains one
residue (glu 40) from both chain a and b in dhodr-ato and two
residues (ser 120 and tyr 356) in dhodr-breq. these residues
are all well defined according to the electron density. the structures have been deposited at the protein data bank (dhodr-ato:
1 uum and dhodr-breq: 1uuo).

modeling of dhodr residues 30–38 was performed using the
homology modules as implemented in insight ii (97.0; biosym/
msi). the template for these residues was taken from dhodhbreq (pdb accession number 1d3g). the program grid (version
21, molecular discovery ltd.; goodford 1985) was used to compute the hydrophobic contour surfaces. this was used to predict
the residues in the small n-terminal domain that are involved in
attachment of dhodc to the membrane and to compare the same
domain in dhodr. the hydrophobic binding affinity was obtained from a summation over the pairwise interactions of hydrophobic probe with the protein atoms.

docking of natural substrate
a truncated quinone was docked into the hydrophobic tunnel of
dhodr-breq where  xxxd363xxx  was removed before docking.
there were no constraints on the torsion angles during the docking
experiment performed with the program autodock (version
3.0.3) from the scripps research institute and molecular graphics
laboratory.

enzyme assay and inhibition studies
all studies were performed with the histidine-tagged enzyme without cleavage of the tag. the chromogen reduction assay was carried out with 1 mm l-dho, 0.1 mm qd, 0.06 mm dcip, 50 mm
tris-hcl, 150 mm kcl at ph 8.0, 0.08% triton (for solubilization
of qd), and 1% dmso (for solubilization of inhibitors) to test
enzyme activities; the assay was started by addition of the enzyme
and measured at a600 nm (␧ ⳱ 18,800 m−1cm−1).
to determine the inhibitory potency of the drug  xxxd243xxx , we
measured the initial velocity of the dhodr-catalyzed reaction at
saturating concentrations of dho (1 mm) and qd (0.1 mm) with
varying drug concentrations in the range of 20 nm up to 200 ␮m.
the equation vi / vo ⳱ 1/[1 + [i]/ic50], where vi is the initial velocity in the presence of the inhibitor at concentration [i] and vo is
the initial velocity in the absence of the inhibitor, was fitted to the
initial velocities in order to find the drug concentration causing
50% inhibition of the enzyme activity (ic50; copeland 2000).
