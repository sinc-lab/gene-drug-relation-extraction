abstract aims/hypothesis: the incretin hormone  xxxg873xxx  (glp-1) has antihyperglycaemic effects,
but its therapeutic usefulness is limited by its metabolic
instability.  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ) is established as the primary inactivating enzyme, but the roles
of other enzymes remain unclear. methods: the effect of
 xxxd419xxx , a selective inhibitor of  xxxg1417xxx 
(nep) 24.11, on glp-1 pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics with or without  xxxg651xxx  inhibition was examined
in anaesthetised pigs. results: during glp-1 infusion,
 xxxd419xxx  doubled c-terminal immunoreactivity, improving the pharmacokinetics (t½ 2.3±0.1 to 8.8±1.2 min; metabolic clearance rate [mcr] 20.4±3.4 to 4.8±0.4 ml·kg−1·
min−1; p<0.01), but had no effect upon intact glp-1
(t½ 1.4±0.1 to 1.6±0.1 min; mcr 47.9±8.0 to 38.8±5.0
ml·kg−1·min−1). insulin responses to intravenous glucose
were unaffected by  xxxd419xxx , but glucose tolerance was
improved (deltaaucmin 27–87 118±5 to 74±14 min·mmol·l−1;
glucose elimination rate [k] 6.6±0.5 to 8.6±0.5%; p<0.05).
when  xxxd419xxx  was co-administered with valine pyrrolidide (a  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor), changes in c-terminal glp-1
pharmacokinetics mirrored those seen when  xxxd419xxx 
alone was administered (t½ 2.7±0.3 and 7.7±0.8 min; mcr
17.3±2.6 and 6.5±0.8 ml·kg−1·min−1 for valine pyrrolidide
without and with  xxxd419xxx , respectively). however, in-

tact glp-1 pharmacokinetics were improved (t½ 2.8±
0.3 and 7.5±0.6 min; mcr 18.3±0.6 and 9.4±0.9 ml·
kg−1·min−1; p<0.02), potentiating the antihyperglycaemic/
insulinotropic effects of glp-1 (glucose deltaaucmin 27– 87
103±8 to 62±14 min·mmol·l−1; k 6.8±0.4 to 11.4±1.4%;
insulin deltaaucmin 27–87 3,680±738 to 7,201±1,183 min·
pmol·l−1; p<0.05). conclusions/interpretation: this study
confirms a role for nep-24.11 in glp-1 metabolism in
vivo, suggesting that up to 50% of glp-1 entering the
circulation may be degraded by nep-24.11. furthermore,
combined inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  and nep-24.11 is superior
to  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone in preserving intact glp-1,
which raises the possibility that the combination has therapeutic potential.

 xxxg873xxx  (glp-1) has a spectrum of effects,
which makes it an attractive target in the search for new
therapies for type 2 diabetes [1]. however, a major factor limiting clinical application is its metabolic instability, as it is rapidly degraded and inactivated in vivo [2–4].
strategies that take advantage of the beneficial effects of
glp-1 include the development of degradation-resistant
analogues and selective enzyme inhibitors to enhance the
effects of the endogenously released peptide [3, 5], and
recent research has focused on glp-1 degradation in vivo
in an attempt to identify the enzymes with physiological
relevance.
structure–activity studies have shown that residues in
the c-terminal region of the peptide are important for

1883

receptor binding, while the n-terminal dipeptide is crucial
for receptor activation [6]. consequently, most studies
investigating glp-1 metabolism have addressed the mechanisms behind the n-terminal truncation, as this seems to
be the primary inactivating step. in vitro studies have revealed that glp-1 is a substrate for dipeptidyl peptidase
iv ( xxxg651xxx ) [7], while subsequent studies in vivo suggest
that  xxxg651xxx  is likely to play a role in regulating its metabolic stability [2–4]. this was confirmed by the finding
that n-terminal cleavage of exogenous and endogenous
glp-1 is practically eliminated by  xxxg651xxx  inhibition in
vivo [8–10] and that endogenous glp-1 stability is improved in mice lacking  xxxg651xxx  catalytic activity [11].
several studies have shown that  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors improve
glucose tolerance in rodents [8, 12–14] and patients with
type 2 diabetes [15, 16]; these inhibitors are now in the
late stages of clinical development as antihyperglycaemic
agents.
fewer studies have examined the involvement of other
enzymes in glp-1 degradation in vivo.  xxxg1417xxx  (nep-24.11, also known as  xxxg1417xxx ; see
turner et al. [17] for review) is a widespread membranebound zinc metallopeptidase with a broad substrate specificity. it is found in high concentrations in the kidney,
where it may be involved in the renal clearance of peptide
hormones. nep can degrade members of the glucagon/secretin/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip)
family of peptides, including glp-1, in vitro [18, 19], but
the significance of this observation in terms of glp-1 degradation in vivo is unknown.
this study investigated the physiological relevance of
nep-24.11 in glp-1 metabolism, using  xxxd419xxx  (a
selective nep-24.11 inhibitor [20, 21]) and a previous
protocol that revealed the physiological role of  xxxg651xxx  in
glp-1 and gip metabolism [9, 22] and of nep-24.11 in
glucagon degradation [23]. the influence of  xxxd419xxx  on
the metabolic stability and antihyperglycaemic/insulinotropic effects of glp-1 was examined in anaesthetised
pigs. in addition, these parameters were examined with
 xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone and with  xxxg651xxx  inhibition together with  xxxd419xxx , to see whether inhibition of nep-

24.11 leads to further improvement beyond that achieved
by  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone. findings from part of this
study (preliminary data; effects of combined  xxxg651xxx /nep
inhibition) have previously been reported in brief [24].

materials and methods
animals and surgical procedures animal studies were in
accordance with international guidelines (national institutes of health publication no. 85-23, revised 1985, and
danish legislation governing animal experimentation, 1987)
and were carried out after permission had been granted by
the animal experiments inspectorate, ministry of justice,
denmark.
non-fasted danish lyy strain pigs (30–35 kg) were
used for study. after premedication with midazolum (0.5
mg/kg,  xxxd2641xxx ; roche, basel, switzerland) and ketamine (10 mg/kg, ketaminol; veterinaria, zurich, switzerland), animals were anaesthetised with i.v. alpha-chloralose
(66 mg/kg; merck, darmstadt, germany) and ventilated
with intermittent positive pressure using n2o/o2. catheters were placed in the right carotid artery for sampling of
arterial blood, in the left ear vein for peptide infusion and
in the right ear vein for valine pyrrolidide (a selective
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitor [25]) and/or  xxxd419xxx  administration.
after surgical preparation, animals were heparinised and
left undisturbed for 30 min. anaesthesia was maintained
with additional chloralose as necessary.
the experimental protocol is outlined in fig. 1. in six
animals, two basal arterial blood samples (3 ml) were
collected, after which 20 ml of vehicle (0.9% nacl), was
given as a bolus over 2 min via an ear vein. after 10 min,
the first of two identical infusions of glp-1 (7-36)amide
(bachem, bubendorf, switzerland; dissolved in 0.9%
nacl containing 1% human  xxxg124xxx ; calbiochem;

a rate of 0.75 pmol·kg−1·min−1 for 47 min using a syringe
pump, commencing at time 0. an intravenous glucose infusion (0.2 g/kg; 50% solution) was administered from
the 28th to the 37th minute. arterial blood samples were

glp-1 infusion) contained enough inhibitor to halt nep24.11 activity in vitro by 74.4±1.8%. the percentage gradually decreased to 60.2±2.4% by the end of the peptide
infusion, reaching 46.1±3.7% in samples collected at the
end of the experiment. a similar percentage of inhibition
was obtained when  xxxd419xxx  was administered after valine pyrrolidide.
effects of  xxxd419xxx  alone the effects of  xxxd419xxx 
alone were examined in six animals. when glp-1 alone
was infused, the overall auc during and after the infusion
(aucmin 0–107) for c-terminal immunoreactivity was
2,634±745 min·pmol·l−1. this was increased by  xxxd419xxx  (to 7,011±1,697 min·pmol·l−1, p=0.0109; fig. 2).
accordingly, the metabolic stability measured by cterminal assay was greatly improved (t½ from 2.3±0.1 to
8.8±1.2 min, p<0.0006; mcr from 20.4±3.4 to 4.8±0.4
ml·kg−1·min−1, p=0.0071). in contrast,  xxxd419xxx  had no
effect on any parameter measured by elisa for intact
glp-1 (aucmin 0–107 from 2,170±159 to 2,181±277
min·pmol·l−1; t½ from 1.4±0.1 to 1.6±0.1 min; mcr from
47.9±8.0 to 38.8±5.0 ml·kg−1·min−1; all p>0.2).
previous studies [9] have revealed no differences in
blood glucose or insulin responses to a first vs a second
glp-1/glucose infusion. in the present study, the presence
of  xxxd419xxx  during the second glp-1 infusion reduced
the glucose excursion compared with during the infusion
of glp-1 alone (fig. 3a; deltaaucmin 27–87 118±5 to 74±14

comparison of  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone and combined
 xxxg651xxx /nep-24.11 inhibition a study of valine pyrrolidide administration alone and combined with  xxxd419xxx 
was carried out in seven animals, but owing to some
sample loss there was only sufficient plasma to measure
glp-1 concentrations with both assays in four animals.
during the first infusion with  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone, nterminal glp-1 degradation was prevented and the pharmacokinetic parameters measured by both assays were
the same (aucmin 0–107 3,656±692 vs 3,387±679 min·
pmol·l−1; t½ 2.7±0.3 vs 2.8±0.3 min; mcr, 17.3±2.6
vs 18.3±0.6 ml·kg−1·min−1; c-terminal assay vs elisa,
all p>0.2). co-administration of  xxxd419xxx  increased
glp-1 concentrations measured by both assays (p<0.03
for each assay, relative to valine pyrrolidide alone), and
although there was a tendency for levels measured by cterminal assay to exceed those measured by elisa, this
was not significant (aucmin 0–107 6,293±614 vs 4,724±
645 min·pmol·l−1, c-terminal vs elisa, p=0.180). accordingly, the t½ was prolonged by the inhibitor combination (c-terminal assay to 7.7±0.8 min, p=0.003; elisa
to 7.5±0.6 min, p=0.001) and the mcr was reduced (cterminal assay to 6.5±0.8 ml·kg−1·min−1, p=0.023; elisa
to 9.4±0.9 ml·kg−1·min−1, p=0.013). overall, plasma profiles resembled the c-terminal plasma glp-1 levels shown
in fig. 2.
data for glp-1 pharmacodynamics are presented for all
seven animals. the improvement in the metabolic stability
of glp-1 was associated with improved antihyperglycaemic and insulinotropic effects. thus, compared with
the first glp-1 infusion with valine pyrrolidide alone,
kglucose was increased by co-administration of  xxxd419xxx 
(from 6.8±0.4 to 11.4±1.4 %/min; p=0.012), resulting in a
smaller glucose excursion following intravenous glucose
(fig. 4a; deltaaucmin 27–87 103±8 vs 62±14 min·mmol·l−1,
p=0.0404).
insulin concentrations in six of the seven animals were
increased by adding  xxxd419xxx , but in one animal, they
were slightly lower. accordingly, when all seven animals
were included (fig. 4b), although the mean auc was increased by  xxxd419xxx  (deltaaucmin 27–87 3,974±689 vs
6,542±1,197 min·pmol·l−1), this failed to reach significance (p=0.130, paired t-test). however, when the one nonresponder was excluded, the increase in insulin secretion
became significant (deltaaucmin 27–87 3,680±738 vs 7,201±
1,183 min·pmol·l−1, p=0.044).
with valine pyrrolidide alone, plasma glucagon concentrations were modestly suppressed by infusion of  xxxg873xxx , even before the glucose infusion, and they decreased
further once glucose was given, before returning to basal
levels (fig. 4c). once  xxxd419xxx  was administered, glucagon concentrations increased more than two-fold in the
period before the glucose challenge. after the glucose load,
the glucagonostatic effect of glp-1 was potentiated, but
on cessation of the glp-1 infusion, glucagon levels were
restored.

after administration of valine pyrrolidide (val-pyd; 300 mumol/kg).
 xxxd419xxx  (candox; 5 mg/kg) was given 60 min after the end of
the first glp-1 infusion, and after a further 30 min the second  xxxg873xxx  infusion was initiated. intravenous glucose (0.2 g/kg) was administered from the 28th to the 37th minute of each glp-1 infusion.

comparison of two successive glp-1 infusions during
 xxxg651xxx  inhibition as described above, valine pyrrolidide
prevents n-terminal glp-1 degradation, giving similar
pharmacokinetic profiles irrespective of which glp-1
assay is used. however, to verify that changes in pharmacodynamics during the second glp-1 infusion with
both inhibitors were a result of elevated glp-1 levels
rather than of the inhibitor combination only being given
with the second glp-1/glucose infusions, a control experiment was performed. animals received two successive
glp-1/glucose infusions during  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone,
revealing identical glp-1 pharmacokinetics (aucmin 0–107

discussion
this study investigated the role of the enzyme nep-24.11
in glp-1 metabolism in vivo using the selective inhibitor
 xxxd419xxx . glp-1 degradation is reduced by  xxxd419xxx ,
thereby confirming a physiological role for nep-24.11 in
its metabolism. however, the possibility that this may be
affected by the anaesthesia cannot be ruled out.
 xxxd419xxx  is the pro-drug of the active compound
 xxxd420xxx  and is a potent competitive and selective
inhibitor of nep-24.11; it was developed as a diuretic for
clinical use [31–33].  xxxd419xxx  does not affect the activity of carboxypeptidase a, leucine aminopeptidase ( xxxg163xxx ) or  xxxg36xxx , which
belong to the same zinc metalloprotease superfamily as
nep-24.11 [20], or that of the more closely nep-related
enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme-1 [31]. following
oral administration,  xxxd419xxx  is rapidly absorbed and
converted to the active drug by plasma esterases [21, 34].
the effective dose in pigs is unknown, but the chosen dose
successfully inhibited glucagon degradation in another
study using a similar protocol [23]. in the present study,
plasma samples contained enough active inhibitor to inhibit
nep-24.11 activity in the in vitro assay by 50 to 75%
(depending on the time elapsing after in vivo  xxxd419xxx 
administration). however, this underestimates the true in
vivo inhibition, because the plasma (and hence the inhibitor) was diluted 63-fold in the activity assay, meaning
that inhibitor concentrations in vitro were much lower than
the original concentrations in vivo, and because the assay
requires the addition of a substrate, which competes with
the inhibitor for binding to the enzyme.
in vitro studies indicated that nep-24.11 can cleave
glp-1, and six potential cleavage sites in the central and cterminal regions were identified. hydrolysis occurred particularly readily between glu27-phe28 and trp31-leu32, and
other sites included asp15-val16, ser18-tyr19, tyr19-leu20
and phe28-ile29 [19]. cleavage at these sites would generate
fragments that are not recognised by either of the glp-1
assays used in the present study. during infusion of glp-1
in the presence of  xxxd419xxx , c-terminal immunoreactive
glp-1 concentrations doubled and the plasma half-life
increased three-fold, suggesting that nep-24.11 is responsible for the degradation of half of the total amount of
glp-1 in the plasma. it has previously been suggested
that while n-terminally directed assays should be used for
measuring biologically active, intact glp-1 concentrations,
c-terminally directed assays (detecting both intact glp-1
and the n-terminally truncated metabolite arising from
 xxxg651xxx -mediated degradation) are more suitable for the
measurement of total glp-1 secretion [35]. in light of the
findings of the present study, it could now be speculated
that current measurements of endogenous glp-1 secretion,
measured by c-terminally directed assays, underestimate
the true secretion by a factor of two. with  xxxd419xxx 

1888

alone, cleavage by nep-24.11 is prevented but  xxxg651xxx  is
still active, leading to an accumulation of the n-terminally truncated metabolite glp-1 (9-36)amide. indeed, levels of intact glp-1 were not significantly affected by
 xxxd419xxx  alone. however, when the two inhibitors were
co-administered, valine pyrrolidide completely prevented
n-terminal glp-1 degradation, and the metabolic stability
of intact glp-1 was improved, resulting in a six-fold increase in its plasma half-life.
the relatively slow clearance of  xxxd419xxx  (1.9 ml·kg−1·
min−1 in humans, 15 ml·kg−1·min−1 in rats [21]) precluded a cross-over experimental design in which the order of inhibitor administration was alternated, raising the
possibility that any changes in glucose or insulin concentrations after  xxxd419xxx  were a result of factors other than nep inhibition. in previous studies using similar
protocols, glp-1 pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in
the absence of any enzyme inhibition were similar during
two successive glp-1 infusions [9]. in the present study,
fluid loss was replaced, heart rate and blood pressure remained constant throughout the experiment, and the effects of the two glp-1 infusions in the presence of valine
pyrrolidide alone were not significantly different. this
suggests that the pharmacodynamic changes seen during
the second glp-1 infusions after  xxxd419xxx  administration were a result of the effects of  xxxd419xxx .
the presence of  xxxd419xxx  during the glp-1 infusion
increased the elimination rate of glucose by 30%, resulting
in a corresponding reduction in the glucose excursion
(auc) compared with during infusion of glp-1 alone.
this cannot be attributed to glp-1 itself, because levels of
biologically active glp-1 were unaffected, indicating that
other factors must be involved. in this context, it is worth
noting that, despite lower glycaemia, insulin levels were
maintained during the second glp-1 infusion with  xxxd419xxx . this suggests that  xxxd419xxx  could have increased levels of another insulin secretagogue; otherwise, a
lower glucose-induced insulin secretion would be expected. additionally, a direct effect of  xxxd419xxx  on insulin
itself may also have contributed to the reduced glucose
excursion. in early studies involving the purification of
nep-24.11, degradation of labelled insulin beta-chain was
used to monitor the enzyme activity [36], suggesting that
nep-24.11 can cleave insulin. however, it is unknown
whether the intact insulin molecule is also a substrate.
moreover, it has also been reported that  xxxd3357xxx  (a less
selective nep-24.11 inhibitor) potentiates the hypoglycaemic effects of insulin in rats in vivo, indicating that nep24.11 could be involved in insulin catabolism [37]. it is,
therefore, possible that  xxxd419xxx  reduced insulin degradation but that this escaped detection with the insulin assay
used. further studies using an insulin assay with a different specificity or using hplc should be able to resolve
this question.
as mentioned above,  xxxd419xxx  may have affected the
degradation of other endogenous nep substrates, which
in turn influenced glucose homeostasis. gip is a substrate
for nep in vitro, albeit a poor one, with a rate of hydrolysis that is two orders of magnitude slower than that of

glp- 1 [19]. nevertheless, the possibility cannot be excluded that  xxxd419xxx  reduced endogenous gip degradation in vivo, which contributed to the antihyperglycaemic
effect, particularly when  xxxg651xxx  was simultaneously inhibited. there is also evidence that bradykinin is degraded
by nep [38], and several studies have shown that selective
nep or dual nep/ace (vasopeptidase) inhibitors lead to
improved insulin sensitivity in obese, insulin-resistant rats
[39–42] via a mechanism involving increased activation of
the kinin–nitrous oxide pathway [39, 42]. this improvement in whole-body insulin-mediated glucose disposal,
effected by nep inhibition, seemed to be a result of improvements in insulin sensitivity rather than secondary to
changes in cardiovascular or renal function, because heart
rate, blood pressure, femoral blood flow and gfr were
unaltered [40, 43].
therefore, given that active glp-1 levels were unaltered
by  xxxd419xxx  alone in the present study, glp-1-independent mechanisms must have been responsible for the improved glucose tolerance seen after nep inhibition alone.
however, in the presence of both inhibitors, the situation
is different. intact glp-1 levels, which are already significantly increased by  xxxg651xxx  inhibition as reported previously [9], increase by a further 40% owing to the
additional effect of the c-terminal stabilisation brought
about by  xxxd419xxx , and this is enough to increase insulin
levels beyond those achieved by  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone.
it is, therefore, reasonable to speculate that in the presence
of both inhibitors, the effect of increased active glp-1
levels together with the glp-1-independent mechanisms
discussed above result in the near doubling of the glucose
elimination rate and explain why the glucose excursion is
almost halved relative to  xxxg651xxx  inhibition alone.
endogenous glucagon levels (measured by c-terminal
assay) increased after  xxxd419xxx  administration, which is
consistent with the results of our recent study showing that
nep-24.11 is involved in glucagon degradation in vivo
[23]. however, n-terminal glucagon immunoreactivity is
unaffected by  xxxd419xxx  [23], and since an intact nterminus is required for the biological activity of glucagon
[44], it was concluded that nep-24.11 in itself does not
regulate this activity [23]. therefore, the changes in endogenous glucagon immunoreactivity seen in the present
study following  xxxd419xxx  administration are likely to
reflect the accumulation of n-terminally truncated (inactive) glucagon fragments, which are unlikely to have
influenced glucose homeostasis.
 xxxg651xxx  cleavage is regarded as being responsible for
the initial inactivation of glp-1, but this study has demonstrated that nep-24.11 also plays a role in the degradation of the intact peptide and the truncated metabolite.
 xxxg651xxx  inhibition protects intact glp-1 from n-terminal
truncation, leading to improved insulinotropic and antihyperglycaemic activity, and this is further enhanced by
concomitant nep-24.11 inhibition.  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors have
reached late-phase clinical trials and have shown promising effects in patients with relatively mild type 2 diabetes
(hba1c of ~7.4%) [15, 16]. their mechanism of action is
believed to include preservation of endogenous intact

1889

glp-1 [45], raising the question of whether this will be
enough to confer sufficient glucose-lowering efficacy,
especially as monotherapy in patients at more advanced
stages of the disease, since there will be a limit to the
level of increase in plasma levels of the active hormone
(dependent on the maximal secretory capacity of the l
cell). in diabetic patients, intact glp-1 accounts for 30 to
50% of endogenous c-terminal glp-1 immunoreactivity
[46], and clinical studies with  xxxg651xxx  inhibition have
reported increases in intact glp-1 of approximately twofold [15]. however, as the present study shows, up to half
of the glp-1 entering the circulation may be degraded by
nep-24.11, suggesting that combining nep inhibition
with  xxxg651xxx  inhibition may be able to further increase
active glp-1 levels, thereby potentiating the effects of
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitor monotherapy. further studies are warranted to examine the effect of nep-24.11 inhibition on
endogenous glp-1 levels, particularly in light of reports
suggesting that increased intact glp-1 may, via a feedback mechanism, inhibit its own release [35]. such studies
may also shed further light on the complex physiological
control mechanisms involved in regulating active glp-1
levels, and may help elucidate the endocrine, paracrine
and/or neuromodulatory role of this important peptide
hormone.
