migraine is a common complex disorder,
currently classified into two main subtypes,
migraine with aura (ma) and migraine without aura (mo). the strong preponderance
of females to males suggests an x-linked
genetic component. recent studies have
identified an x chromosomal susceptibility
region (xq24–q28) in two typical migraine
pedigrees. this region harbours a potential
candidate gene for the disorder, the  xxxg1115xxx  (5-ht2c) gene. this study
involved a linkage and association approach
to investigate two single nucleotide variants
in the 5-ht2c gene. in addition, exonic coding
regions of the 5-ht2c gene were also sequenced for mutations in x-linked migraine
pedigrees. results of this study did not detect
any linkage or association, and no disease
causing mutations were identified. hence,
results for this study do not support a significant role of the 5-ht2c gene in migraine
predisposition. ß 2003 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
migraine, a common complex neurovascular disorder,
affecting 12% of caucasian populations remains
largely idiopathic. characteristic of this debilitating
disorder are recurrent attacks of severe headache,
vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. frequency
and duration of these symptoms are highly variable

among affected individuals. current clinical diagnoses
of migraine categorize the disorder into either migraine
with aura (ma) (previously classic migraine) or migraine without aura (mo) (previously common migraine)
[international headache society, 1988]. evidence for
genetic factors in migraine has been demonstrated by
twin heritability studies indicating pairwise concordance rates that are higher in monozygotic twins than in
dizygotic twins [honkasalo et al., 1995; larsson et al.,
1995]. familial risk estimates have indicated that 50%
of migraine sufferers have an affected first degree
relative [goadsby et al., 1991]. familial risk for ma
and mo in first degree relatives of probands is increased
2.2-and 2.9-fold respectively, in comparison with the
general population [russell et al., 1993]. additionally,
spouses of the probands were less susceptible to the risk
of migraine than were first degree relatives, thus suggesting the importance of genetic factors [russell et al.,
1993].
epidemiological studies conducted approximately
10 years apart have reported a 1-year prevalence of migraine varying between 17.6–18.6% amongst females,
and 5.7–6.5% amongst males [stewart et al., 1992;
lipton et al., 2001]. the strong preponderance of females
to males (3:1) suffering from typical migraine, suggests
an x-linked genetic component. in support of this,
linkage studies in our laboratory showed promising evidence of excess allele sharing to a genomic region
telomeric to the q arm of the x chromosome (xq24–
q28) in two large migraine pedigrees [nyholt et al., 1998,
2000]. within this linkage region is the serotonin
receptor (5-ht2c) candidate gene localised to xq24
[milatovich et al., 1992]. belonging to the  xxxg1113xxx 
subclass, this receptor has been implicated in gastrointestinal and vascular smooth muscle contraction,
platelet aggregation, neuronal depolarisation, and the
disorders of hypertension and migraine [borne, 1994].
the density of 5-ht2c receptors has been reported
to be highest within the choroid plexus of rats with
lower levels of the receptor protein found in the cerebral
cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and substantia nigra
[kennett et al., 1994]. the distribution of receptor
proteins in the rat is very similar to the distribution in
humans as these findings support previous autoradiographic and mrna distribution studies [abramowski
et al., 1995]. high levels of the  xxxg1115xxx  in the
choroid plexus has initiated suggestions that it may

5-ht2c, investigation in typical medicine

regulate cerebral spinal fluid levels. preliminary results
from chugani et al. [1999] also noted increased cerebral
blood flow in the brain stem during migraine headache,
and patients with migraine displaying a significantly
higher serotonin synthesis capacity in all brain regions studied, a finding specific to patients with mo
[chugani et al., 1999]. fluctuations in serotonin levels
and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa),
have been known to occur, before and during a migraine
attack [curran et al., 1965; anthony et al., 1967; rolf
et al., 1981; ferrari et al., 1989]. the importance of this
gene as an aetiological candidate is further enhanced
due to evidence of serotonin receptors interacting with
various drugs used to alleviate migraine headache
[fozard and kalkman, 1994; kalkman, 1994; schmuck
et al., 1996; kalkman, 1997]. in addition, kennett et al.
[1994] has hypothesised that the  xxxg1115xxx  may
also mediate the prophylactic effects of the non-selective
 xxxg1115xxx  antagonists in migraine treatment.
an open reading frame (orf) polymorphism resulting
in a guanine to cytosine transversion, and a subsequent
amino acid substitution (cys23ser) has been identified
previously within the 5-ht2c gene [lappalainen et al.,
1995]. migraine investigations of this locus have been
negative to date for association [burnet et al., 1997] and
linkage [buchwalder et al., 1996]. more recently, a single
nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in the 30 untranslated
region (30 utr) of the 5-ht2c gene has been identified
[song et al., 1999]. to date, there have been no published
reports analysing the 30 utr locus and migraine. this
study undertook a comprehensive investigation of the
5-ht2c gene, utilizing linkage, association, and sequencing methods to test 5-ht2c for involvement in typical
migraine that encompasses both ma and mo subtypes.
before subject acquisition, griffith university0 s ethics
committee for experimentation on human subjects
approved ethical clearance. all participating subjects in
the study gave informed consent and were of caucasian
origin. diagnosis of typical migraine was carried out by
an approved questionnaire and clinical evaluation carried out by a neurologist in accordance with specified
criteria set by the international headache society
[international headache society, 1988]. two multigenerational caucasian pedigrees (denoted mf7 and
mf14) shown previously to exhibit excess allele sharing to xq24–q28 markers [nyholt et al., 1998, 2000]
were selected for non-parametric linkage analysis of the
5-ht2c polymorphisms. nineteen of the tested 28 individuals in mf7, and 16 of the tested 36 members in mf14
were diagnosed with either ma or mo. association
analysis was also carried out on a population of 275 unrelated migraineurs and 275 unrelated non-migraineurs
who were matched for gender, age (5 years) and
ethnicity (caucasian origin). this association population provided a female to male ratio of 2.8:1. ethnically
matched populations are important to avoid population
stratification and hence, false positive associations.
dna preparation for linkage and association analysis
required 20 ml of blood from each subject before a salting
out extraction procedure according to the method of
miller et al. [1988]. a previously identified rflp in the
orf of the 5-ht2c gene [lappalainen et al., 1995] was

87

amplified by pcr, digested with the hinf i restriction
endonuclease and subjected to 5% ultra high resolution
agarose gel electrophoresis. bands were visualized
under ultraviolet light after ethidium bromide staining, and molecular sizes (bp) assessed. a second rflp
identified in the 30 utr of the 5-ht2c gene [song et al.,
1999] was amplified by pcr. oligonucleotide site specific mutagenesis was employed to design primers [sense
50 -gcttttcacttcttaaggcccg-30 ; antisense 50 caattgatgttgaatcctg-30 ], introducing a smai
recognition sequence. digested pcr products were electrophoresed on 5% ultra high resolution agarose gels.
bands were visualized under ultraviolet light after
ethidium bromide staining, and molecular sizes (bp)
assessed. subjects from both the association population
and the mf7 and mf14 pedigrees were genotyped for
both markers.
five (1 male, 4 female) affected individuals from mf7
with an average age (se) of 49  10 years all suffering
from ma were selected for sequence analysis. an additional seven members (3 male, 4 female) from mf14 with
an average age of 52  10 years (5 with ma, 2 with mo)
were also selected for exonic mutation screening. primers specific for the coding regions of the 5-ht2c gene,
that is, exons 3, 4, 5 and 6, were selected to carry out
pcr amplification in accordance with standard procedures. pcr fragments then underwent sequencing
using qiagentm sequencing kits and electrophoresed
using an abi-377 automated dna sequencertm. editviewtm and sequenchertm software was used to assess
and analyse all sequence data.
linkage analysis has proven to be an effective means
of investigating diseases with known inheritance patterns. ambiguous disease models and modes of transmission, however, can be detrimental to classic linkage
applications. model free linkage analysis was therefore carried out using the sall scoring function of
the genehunter plus (x version 1.2) program to
avoid any such associated ambiguities [kong and cox,
1997]. association analysis between the migraine and
non-migraine groups was performed by a standard w2
analysis. the power of the association population was
based on two alternative hypotheses of an associated
rare allele at a ¼ 0.05 for the orf and 30 utr polymorphisms exhibiting a prevalence of 15% and 4% in
the general population, respectively. therefore, to detect a two-fold increase in the case group we estimate
the power of this study to be approximately 95% and
85%, respectively. it should be noted that these
power estimates do not factor in the effects of disease
and marker parameters such as penetrances, traitinfluencing allele frequency and distance from marker
to trait-influencing locus. linkage disequilibrium (ld)
analysis was performed on the two 5-ht2c markers
using the eh (estimated haplotypes) program [xie and
ott, 1993] on male and female data separately, due to
males being hemizygous for x-linked loci.
affected individuals from the mf7 and mf14 pedigrees showing excess allele sharing to the xq24–q28
genomic region [nyholt et al., 1998, 2000] were screened
for the 5-ht2c cys23ser variant and other mutations within the coding regions of this gene. sequencing

88

johnson et al.

revealed no mutations present in the coding exons in any
of the affected mf7 and mf14 individuals. also, there
was no presence of the cys23ser polymorphism in the
tested pedigree members.
the sall scoring function of genehunter plus
calculates identical by descent (ibd) allele sharing
between all individuals in the pedigrees simultaneously.
reporting the genehunter plus lod* score statistic provides a more efficient measure of incomplete
inheritance information, and selection of the exponential allele sharing model (asm-exp) over the linear allele
sharing model (asm-lin) provides a better fit to data
consisting of a small number of pedigrees (n ¼ 2) [kong
and cox, 1997]. for the orf marker, a lod* score of
0.0158 (p ¼ 0.405) was reported for the mf7 and mf14
pedigrees, both with heterozygosity values <0.1. additionally, a lod* score of 0.0338 (p ¼ 0.346) was reported for the 30 utr marker in both mf7 and mf14 with
heterozygosity values of 0 and <0.1, respectively. very
low heterozygosity values for either pedigree is indicative of very little genetic information.
the orf and 30 utr polymorphisms were genotyped
in the affected and unaffected migraine populations and
are presented in table i. allele frequencies for each of
the two 5-ht2c genetic markers were analysed by a
standard w2 analysis, results of which were non-significant (p > 0.05). given the female: male (3:1) preponderance of migraine sufferers, the notion of an x-linked
genetic component has been suggested [stewart et al.,
1991, 1992; rasmussen and olesen, 1992; launer et al.,
1999; rozen et al., 1999]. therefore a secondary analysis
of male migraine sufferers for both orf and 30 utr
polymorphisms was carried out (table ii). allele frequencies for both 5-ht2c polymorphisms were once
again analysed by w2 analysis, results of which were nonsignificant (p > 0.05). the reduced size of the male sample
(n ¼ 72) subsequently reduced the power to detect a significant increased allele frequency in this test group.
there was no evidence for ld between either marker
or a possible disease locus. additionally, there was no
evidence for ld between the two tested markers (males,
p > 0.4; females, p > 0.3) within the 5-ht2c gene.
the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) has been implicated in a variety of
neurological disorders, such as anxiety and mental depression, as well as migraine [meltzer and lowry, 1987;
humphrey et al., 1990; taylor, 1990]. the serotonin

transporter gene (sert or  xxxg2150xxx ) has been shown
to display altered allele frequency distributions in a
danish population suffering from ma and mo [ogilvie
et al., 1998]. in addition, a possible role for serotonin in
migraine has been suggested by chugani et al. [1999] as
levels of 5-ht are altered during migraine attack. these
factors considered, it is important to analyse genetic
variants in serotonergic genes as possible candidates
for migraine predisposition. previous publications have
reported a negative association [burnet et al., 1997] and
exclusion of linkage [buchwalder et al., 1996] for the
orf polymorphism in typical migraine. this study confirms a negative association and no evidence of linkage
with the orf (cys23ser) variant, but also reports no
association or evidence of linkage with the 30 utr variant identified by song et al. [1999]. the linkage findings
however, can best be described as inconclusive due to
very insufficient genetic information in both mf7 and
mf14 as all individuals with the exception of one in mf7
and two individuals in mf14 were homozygous for the
wild-type (g) allele for the orf variant. additionally, all
individuals with the exception of one, in both pedigrees
were homozygous for the wild-type (t) allele for the
30 utr variant. linkage disequilibrium results are also
inconclusive due to very little or no genetic information,
thus reflecting the high level of homozygosity of both
markers. the high level of homozygosity for the orf
polymorphism is also reflective of the absence of the
mutation from sequenced individuals from mf7 and
mf14.
overall, there was no evidence indicating that the
orf or 30 utr locus of the  xxxg1115xxx  gene is involved in typical migraine. in making such a statement,
however, it must be noted that the low informativeness,
low heterozygosity of these loci and low frequency of the
mutant alleles meant that these markers did not provide
much genetic information in either linkage or association analyses. results also did seem to indicate that ld
did not exist between the two 5-ht2c markers tested.
once again though, low mutant allele frequencies could
result in inhibited haplotype analysis of the two tested
markers. of particular note, however, is the fact that
despite the mf7 and mf14 pedigrees displaying positive
evidence of excess allele sharing to this xq24–q28
chromosomal region, sequencing of all the coding regions of a prime candidate gene (5-ht2c) located within
this region did not reveal any new mutations in affected

members of these pedigrees. hence this study does not
support a significant role for the 5-ht2c gene in migraine, although, this does not completely exclude this
gene as intron-exon boundaries or promoter region mutatios may still be involved in the disorder.
