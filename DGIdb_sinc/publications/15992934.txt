melatonin, an indoleamine neurohormone that is synthesized mainly in the pineal gland and derived from
5-ht, has many effects on a wide range of physiopathological functions. some of these effects are
mediated by the interactions of melatonin with the
two melatonin mt1 and mt2 receptors. other effects are
often suggested to be due to the chemical antioxidant
nature of this indoleamine, and are observed at high,
non-physiological concentrations. however, it is
increasingly believed that some of these effects are
due to interactions with other protein targets. in this
review, we summarize the molecular pharmacology of
melatonin, including the main enzymes involved in its
synthesis and catabolism, and the proteins that mediate
its actions. furthermore, various compounds, mainly
inhibitors and antagonists, that can be used to dissect
these functions and pathways are presented.

melatonin: a pharmacological agent with a plethora of
actions
melatonin is a neurohormone that is synthesized in the
pineal gland. its production is controlled through the
suprachiasmatic nucleus by the photoperiod (i.e. the succession of nights and days). melatonin relays the information about this photoperiod to the tissues that express
melatonin binding sites in both central and peripheral
nervous systems. melatonin has been claimed to exert
many functions (box 1). however, in humans, appropriate
clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of melatonin only
in circadian-rhythm sleep disorders. an animal model is
considered to be relevant for human pathology only if it
has been validated by drugs for which their efficacy has
been demonstrated in clinical trials. results of preclinical
studies in such validated animal models suggest that
other therapeutic options exist for melatonin [1], particularly in wake–sleep disorders, depression and aging.
indeed, a novel treatment of depression that involves a
melatonin component has been proposed recently and
validated clinically with agomelatinew, a dual melatonin
mt1– xxxg1477xxx  agonist and  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist [2]. the main curiosity associated with the wide range
of proposed functions of melatonin is the concentration at
which melatonin is active. depending on its actions,
melatonin is reportedly active at concentrations ranging

from subnanomolar to millimolar doses, although melatonin circulates at a nightly peak concentration in the low
nanomolar range (0.3 nm).
to understand the complex pharmaco-physiology of
melatonin it is important to identify the exact number of
molecular targets through which melatonin exerts its effects.
to date, three proteins to which melatonin binds with strong
affinity have been identified: the two well-characterized
g-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane-domain receptors
(gpcrs) mt1 and mt2, and the less-characterized cytosolic  xxxg1593xxx  ( xxxg1593xxx ). however, melatonin also
exerts other actions. for example, melatonin can regulate
the expression of genes [3] and it is reported to exhibit
antioxidant activities at high, non-physiological concentrations [4]. other interesting targets related to melatonin are the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis
including, in particular, the enzyme that catalyses the
limiting step in its synthesis, the acetylating enzyme
 xxxg4xxx  ( xxxg4xxx ;  xxxg4xxx ), and
the enzymes that catalyse its oxidative catabolism,
myeloperoxidase (mpo; ec 1.11.1.7) and indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase (ido;  xxxg147xxx .11) (figures 1 and 2).
by fine-tuning the activities of these enzymes, the
synthesis or catabolism of melatonin can be limited
artificially. in this review, the most interesting chemical
tools available for the study of melatonin pathways
are discussed.

figure 1. melatonin pathways. (a) biosynthesis. melatonin is synthesized from
tryptophan. hydroxylation at position 5 of the indole moiety of tryptophan and
decarboxylation leads to the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan, which undergoes
methylation of a hydroxyl group in position 5 and n-acetylation to form melatonin.
(b) activity. melatonin acts through three known binding sites, mt1 and mt2
receptors and the cytosolic enzyme  xxxg1593xxx  ( xxxg1593xxx /mt3), which is
involved in toxification and detoxification processes. (c) catabolism. the
catabolism of melatonin is mediated through two main pathways. 60% of
melatonin is hydroxylated at position 6 and further conjugated to the hydrophilic
moieties glucuronyl or sulfate groups, catalysed by udp-glucuronosyltransferase
or sulfotransferase, respectively. furthermore, w15% is metabolised by myeloperoxidase and/or by indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, leading to the pharmacologically active n1-acetyl-5-methoxy-kynurenine (amk) (a member of the family of
kynurenamines). w25% of melatonin remains unchanged. see compound

another experimentally difficult aspect of melatonin
pharmacology is that in vivo studies depend on the
diurnal–nocturnal cycle of the experimental animals.
laboratory rodents are nocturnal (i.e. are active at
night) but their melatonin rhythms are similar to humans
(i.e. with peak production during the night). consequently, the results obtained in rodents cannot be
extrapolated directly to diurnal species.

how melatonin is synthesized from 5-ht
the enzyme serotonin-n-acetyltransferase
melatonin is synthesized in a pathway (figure 2) in which
the first steps involve tryptophan hydroxylation and
subsequent decarboxylation. these processes lead to the
formation of serotonin (5-ht), which in turn is acetylated
on the free amine and then o-methylated on the
5-hydroxyl position. the limiting step of this process is
the alkylation of 5-ht, which is catalysed by  xxxg4xxx . this
process takes place mainly in the pineal gland, where
 xxxg4xxx  is expressed [5], despite a recent report suggesting that it is present in other cells, such as mucosal
enterochromaffin (ec) cells [6]. furthermore, melatonin
can be synthesized by o-methylation of n-acetyl-5hydroxytryptamine. this reaction appears to occur in
the gut, where high levels of melatonin have been
identified, which is not consistent with a pineal production
of melatonin.  xxxg4xxx  has been cloned from various

figure 2. from tryptophan to kynurenine: the synthesis and catabolism of
melatonin. melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan in a four-step pathway.
first, tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan by tryptophan 5 monooxygenase (t5m;  xxxg2315xxx ). aromatic-l -amino-acid decarboxylase (aaad;
 xxxg618xxx ) then catalyses the conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is converted to n- xxxd70xxx  by serotonin-n-acetyltransferase ( xxxg4xxx ). the last step in this biosynthetic pathway is catalysed by
hydroxyindol-o-methyltransferase ( xxxg198xxx ;  xxxg198xxx ), which leads to the
formation of melatonin. melatonin is eliminated from the body by two concomitant
processes. (i) the classical hydroxylation pathway. in this pathway cytochrome
p450 1a2 (cyt p450 1a2, a member of the ec 1.14.14.1 family of enzymes) catalyses
the formation of 6-hydroxymelatonin, which undergoes further conjugation with
either sulfate, catalysed by sulfotransferase  xxxg2228xxx  (a member of the ec 2.8.2.1
family), to form 6-sulfomelatonin, or glucuronic acid, catalysed by udp-glucuronosyltransferase (a member of the ec 2.4.1.17 family), to form 6-hydroxymelatonin
glucuronide. (ii) alternatively, the indole core of melatonin is opened during
oxidation catalysed by indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (ido) and/or myeloperoxidase (mpo). the compound formed during this process is the unstable
intermediary compound n1-acetyl-n2-formyl-5-methoxy-kynurenine, which is
de-formylated to the more stable n 1-acetyl-5-methoxy-kynurenine (amk).

species, including humans [7]. the majority of the studies
has examined ovine  xxxg4xxx , probably because posttranscriptional mechanisms dominate the regulation of
ovine and primate aanats (as occurs in humans),
whereas in rats both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in the regulation of the
enzyme [6]. using a truncated version of the ovine enzyme
to enhance its solubility (as opposed to the poorly soluble
full-length human enzyme), two research groups obtained
the  xxxg4xxx  crystal structure [8–10]. interestingly, despite
highly conserved sequences between ovine and human
(77.4%), the respective features of the enzymes are
different. indeed, the recombinant ovine and rat enzymes
were purified easily to homogeneity after expression in
escherichia coli, whereas the human enzyme remained,
under identical expression and purification conditions, a
minor contaminant of the e. coli chaperone protein  xxxg1106xxx 
[11]. therefore, the differences in the behaviour of these
enzymes were difficult to attribute to intrinsic reasons
(e.g. sequence and three-dimensional structures) or to the
presence of a large amount of the chaperone  xxxg1106xxx . it was
only after several strategies of expression [11] that a way
to purify the human enzyme to homogeneity was found,
enabling differences in enzymatic behaviour of the
 xxxg4xxx  to be attributed to intrinsic reasons (and not to
its association with this chaperone). furthermore, a
fascinating aspect of melatonin biochemistry is the way
its production, in the brain, is controlled at the level of the
 xxxg4xxx  enzyme. indeed, complex control of the catabolism
of melatonin is exerted through various phosphorylations
of  xxxg4xxx  [by  xxxg1836xxx  (pka), but also by other
kinases such as  xxxg1969xxx  or checkpoint protein 1
( xxxg442xxx )] [12] and the subsequent association of the
phosphorylated  xxxg4xxx  with the chaperone-like 14.3.3
protein [13]. this dimerization either drives the complex
to a proteasome-mediated destruction or protects the
complex against this destruction. catabolism of  xxxg4xxx ,
however, seems to be limited to the pineal gland, whereas
the retinal  xxxg4xxx  enzyme appears to be protected
against destruction during the day [14].

toolbox: substrates and inhibitors
 xxxg4xxx  recognizes a large number of arylalkylamines,
including synthetic arylalkylamines [15,16]. this feature
might indicate that  xxxg4xxx  can acetylate xenobiotic
compounds, leading to slightly more hydrophobic n-acetyl
derivatives thereof. the search for inhibitors of  xxxg4xxx 
should have been facilitated by the availability of the
ovine truncated enzyme crystal (see earlier). however,
using these coordinates, several hundreds of thousands of
molecules were screened in a classical virtual screening
approach but no new inhibitors were identified [16]. to
identify new inhibitor entities, other strategies have
been used, including systematic screening [17] and combinatorial library deconvolution (a technique used to
identify a single peptide in a mixture of peptides [73])
[16]. the main  xxxg4xxx  inhibitors and melatonin receptor
ligands that have been discovered using these techniques
are shown in figure 3, with representative data related to
their potencies shown in table 1. the major breakthrough,
however, came from an approach comprising the design of
bisubstrate analogues (i.e. mimics of the substrate
tryptamine, and of the co-substrate acetyl-coa) and the
description of an original enzyme-mediated mechanism of
in situ production of potent inhibitors such as n-bromoacetyltryptamine (bat) [18,19]. independently, melatoninderived compounds were synthesized as inhibitors [20],
with ic50 values in the nanomolar to micromolar range
(table 1), but with a major bias: these compounds were at
the same time potent melatonin receptor agonists [19]
{also for observed for bmnep (see chemical names) [21]};
therefore, while impairing the synthesis of the hormone,
they would substitute for it at its receptor level, mimicking
the effect(s) of melatonin.
molecular targets: gpcrs
melatonin receptors
the effects of melatonin are mediated through highaffinity gpcrs. mt1 receptors are located mainly on cells
of the pituitary pars tuberalis (pt), whereas there is no
evidence to suggest that mt2 receptors are present in the
pt. by contrast, both mt1 and mt2 receptors are located

 xxxg4xxx  [15]. 6-chloromelatonin, a melatonin receptor super-agonist (i.e. is more potent than the natural agonist), is an experimental ligand used for receptor binding studies.
luzindole (n-acetyl-2-benzyltryptamine) is a nonselective mt1 and  xxxg1477xxx  antagonist [69]. 4p-pdot (4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin) [36] and bmnep (4-phenyl-2propionamidotetralin) [21] are selective  xxxg1477xxx  antagonists, whereas s26131 is a selective  xxxg1476xxx  antagonist [27,70], and  xxxd3078xxx  (ralmeteonw) is a nonselective
mt1 and  xxxg1477xxx  agonist [71].

in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [22]. the radiolabelled
molecule 2-[125i]- xxxd2377xxx  has been used in binding
and radioautography studies [23] and has enabled
detection of melatonin binding sites expressed at low
density in most tissues in which effects of melatonin have
been reported. 2-[125i]- xxxd2377xxx  is the only radioligand available [23] for the study of melatonin receptor
subtypes.
in 1994, the first melatonin receptor was cloned from
xenopus laevis immortalized melanophore mrnas [24],
but expressed only in non-mammalian species (chicken,
birds and fish). subsequently, mt1 and mt2 receptors
have been cloned in humans [25,26]. they show high
identity at the amino acid level (w55% overall and 70%
within transmembrane domains) and have similar affinities for melatonin [27]. the low density of melatonin
binding sites in animal tissues has made their study more
difficult. indeed, in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, one of the
main targets of melatonin, the receptor density is w4 fmol
per mg protein (i.e. w100 times lower than 5-ht receptors
in other brain structures) [28].

genetically engineered mice have been constructed,
and  xxxg1476xxx  knockout mice exhibit no detectable
melatonin binding in the brain [29], whereas  xxxg1477xxx 
knockout mice exhibit the same apparent phenotype as
wild-type mice [30]. further characterization of the
physiology and behaviour of double mt1 and  xxxg1477xxx 
knockout mice is still needed [30].
the transduction pathways mediated by these melatonin
receptors remain an unsolved and complex issue [31]. the
 xxxg1476xxx  couples to different g proteins, one of which
mediates inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the other
activates phospholipase cb (plc-b). the  xxxg1477xxx 
couples to phosphoinositide (ptdins) production, the
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the inhibition of the
soluble  xxxg1587xxx  pathway. melatonin stimulates
the formation of phosphoinositides to w40–60% above

(4p-pdot) attenuates melatonin-mediated stimulation of
ptdins hydrolysis [32].
a brief pressure ejection of melatonin onto rat
cerebellar granule cells in culture induces a significant
and reversible increase of the delayed rectifier kc current
amplitude in most tested cells [33]. this effect is concentration dependent, and is mimicked by  xxxd2377xxx ,
whereas pretreatment of the cultured cells with pertussis
toxin impairs this action of melatonin. mt1 receptors are
present in pancreas b-cells and are coupled to insulin
secretion through an inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase–
camp pathway [34].
receptor-mediated melatonin actions
there are hundreds of reports on the actions of melatonin
in almost any physio-pathological process. some of these
studies are based on the use of so-called pharmacological
doses (1 mm and above), as opposed to physiological doses
(below the nanomolar range) [21] of melatonin. it is
difficult to determine which actions of melatonin are
mediated through its receptors and which are mediated
through its antioxidant activity or its inhibition of  xxxg1593xxx 
enzymatic activity (see later). in 2003, this literature was
reviewed [35], and it was concluded that specific receptor
ligands were needed to dissect these different functions.
agomelatinew, a mixed mt1– xxxg1477xxx  agonist and
5ht2c receptor antagonist, is the first compound in this
class to show an interesting clinical profile in depression.
ralmeteonw is a mt1– xxxg1477xxx  agonist that has been
developed to treat sleep disorders.
toolbox: agonists and antagonists
melatonin has equally high affinity for both receptor
subtypes (in the nanomolar range). its analogue
 xxxd2377xxx  is more potent, with affinities of 40 pm
and 180 pm for mt1 and mt2 receptors, respectively. the
molecular pharmacology of the human receptors, in
addition to cloned ovine receptors, has been reported in
detail [27,36], and selective ligands for the receptor
subtypes have been identified recently. 4p-pdot [37] is
specific for the  xxxg1477xxx  subtype, whereas the
antagonist s26131 is 100 times more potent at mt1
receptors than mt2 receptors [27] (figure 3). these
ligands are valuable pharmacological tools to study the
respective functional roles of these receptors [27,37].
approximately 300 different molecules with affinity for
the receptors, with potencies ranging from subnanomolar
to micromolar values, have been reported [38,39].
mt3 is  xxxg1593xxx : towards the rationalization of the
antioxidant properties of melatonin?
purification and characterization of the mt3 binding site
the binding site mt3 has been identified in hamster brain
membrane preparations [40,41]. two major observations
related to this binding site remain poorly documented:
(i) the membrane preparations used for some of these
experiments were poorly characterized (being mainly lowspeed centrifuged brain homogenates [41]), and therefore
probably included cytosol; and (ii) this binding site was
coupled to inositol production in the rpmi cell line [42], a
feature that strongly suggests that it was indeed a new

melatonin seven- xxxg1608xxx  closely resembling the two previously identified receptors mt1 and
mt2 [42]. the discovery of a specific ligand [mca-nat
(5-methoxycarbonylamino-n-acetyltryptamine)] has helped
further studies of this binding site [43]. indeed, until much
later, binding on this mt3 site could only be performed at
48c [40]. independently, a series of binding experiments
using methods to counteract the fast kinetic parameters of
this binding site permitted confirmation of its presence not
only in hamster brain [44], but also in various organs such
as lung and kidneys of various species, including dogs
and monkeys [45]. the purification to homogeneity of this
binding site permitted the identification of this protein as
 xxxg1593xxx  [46]. this enzyme has remarkable features because
its main hydride donor co-substrate is a product of the
catabolism of nadh ribosyl-nicotinamide. although still
controversial, it seems that  xxxg1593xxx  has a detoxification role,
similar to its analogue  xxxg1592xxx . surprisingly, mice in which
the gene encoding  xxxg1593xxx  has been deleted have been shown
to be more resistant to  xxxd2563xxx  than wild-type mice,
which is contrary to its detoxification role [47]. in another
strain of  xxxg1593xxx -deleted mice, the obvious lack of the mt3
binding site, as measured by [125i]-mca-nat binding,
demonstrated that mt3 was indeed identical to the  xxxg1593xxx 
protein [48]. in any case, further studies are needed in
relation to melatonin, to better understand the relationship between this curious enzyme and the last of the
melatonin binding sites.
toolbox: substrates and inhibitors
several chemical tools are available to study the mt3
binding site. the main tool, as stated earlier, is mca-nat
(figure 4) [43], although other tools are also available [49]
(figure 4). several chemicals have been screened recently
in the search for  xxxg1593xxx  substrates [50]. however, results
were poor and only one (coenzyme q0) out of almost 100
quinones turned out to be a substrate of  xxxg1593xxx . further
studies led to the discovery that  xxxg1593xxx  can use coenzyme
q0, q1 and q2 as substrates [50]. furthermore, a large
family of flavonoid-like molecules was tested as inhibitors.
a few compounds with micromolar potencies for enzyme
inhibition were identified [50,51]. one of the most
surprising and interesting reports published recently
was the co-crystallization of  xxxg1593xxx  with resveratrol [52], a
compound isolated from red wine and suspected to be
responsible of the so-called ‘french paradox’, (i.e. the
perplexing disconnect between france’s rich cuisine and
slender population) [53]. the same authors clearly showed
that resveratrol is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1593xxx  activity
(35 nm) and that its protective effect is mimicked by the
deletion of  xxxg1593xxx  activity in stable  xxxg1593xxx -rnai k562 cells
[52]. the melatonin-mediated inhibition of  xxxg1593xxx  activity at
high doses suggests, in a parallel manner, that melatonin
might have a similar effect on  xxxg1593xxx -mediated toxification
activities.

[indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (ido) inhibitors]. mca-nat (5-methoxycarbonylamino-n-acetyltryptamine) [42] and immnea (n-[2-(2-iodo-5-methoxy-1-methyl-6-nitroindol3-yl)ethyl]-amide) [48] are specific ligands for mt3/ xxxg1593xxx . resveratrol is thought to be an inhibitor of  xxxg1593xxx  [52] whereas chrysoeriol is an inhibitor of  xxxg1593xxx /mt3 catalytic activity
[50]. n1-acetyl-5-methoxy-kynurenine (amk) is the main oxidised catabolite of melatonin [55]. the most commonly used inhibitors of ido are 1-methyl-tryptophan [72]
and 5-hydroxytryptophan [55] and the most commonly used inhibitor of myeloperoxidase is salicylhydroxamic acid [62].

understood, with the exception of the conjugation steps
that account for w70% of the ingested dose ([54] and
references therein). a proportion of melatonin (w15%) is
excreted untransformed. the remaining catabolism
(figure 2) has been attributed to ido [55], an enzyme
found in all tissues but liver. however, purified ido
cannot cleave melatonin or n-acetyl-tryptophan [56]. ido
catalyses two types of activities: (i) the well-known
dioxygenase reaction, which is independent of hydrogen
peroxide and converts tryptophan to kynurenine; and
(ii) the less-studied peroxidase-like reaction, which uses
 xxxd2298xxx  as a co-substrate [57]. the use of
 xxxd2298xxx  as a co-substrate is a common feature
of many haem-containing enzymes. both reactions,
however, lead to an identical product. by contrast, several
reports [58,59] have suggested that another enzyme,
mpo, might be responsible for the oxidative breakdown
of melatonin. the affinities of both enzymes (ido and
mpo) for melatonin are in the micromolar range.
although it seems that melatonin is cleaved by both
pathways, melatonin appears to be cleaved mainly
through the mpo-mediated pathway. indeed, under the
experimental conditions of tryptophan breakdown, melatonin is not a substrate of ido, whereas it is a substrate of
mpo, which strongly suggests that mpo is the melatoninoxidising enzyme in vivo [60].
this oxidative catabolism leads to the formation of a
kynurenine derivative, n1-acetyl-n2-formyl-5-methoxykynurenine (afmk), which is further metabolised, either
spontaneously or enzymatically by kynunerine formamidase, to n1-acetyl-5-methoxy-kynurenine (amk). the
importance of these metabolites is poorly recognized but
they might explain some of the unexpected actions of
melatonin in vivo [61].

toolbox: substrates and inhibitors
the tools available to study ido are scarce. two
inhibitors, derived from tryptophan, have been reported
www.sciencedirect.com

for ido, and a single inhibitor has been reported for mpo
(salicylhydroxamic acid) [62] (figure 4).
other targets?
much remains to be understood about melatonin. future
work will focus on the discovery of new melatonin targets.
melatonin nuclear binding sites have been reported in the
liver [63] and melatonin has also been described as ligand
for the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor-related orphan receptor
(ror), retinoid z receptor (rzr) family of orphan nuclear
receptors [64] but the direct binding at these receptors has
not been repeated by other groups studying either
melatonin receptors or nuclear receptors and is highly
controversial [65,66].
concluding remarks
in most cases, a molecule is not an actual target in the
search for drugs. however, there are o11 200 citations
related to melatonin in pubmedw, which highlight the
fascinating characteristics of melatonin. melatonin has
been described as having an effect in almost all the main
physiological functions of the body. thus, its molecular
targets are of particular interest. indeed, it is difficult to
believe that two seven-transmembrane receptors and one
enzyme are the sole proteins through which this pineal
hormone exerts its effects. furthermore, the discovery of
the third site,  xxxg1593xxx , added many questions to the list,
instead of solving problems. functions that involve the
melatonin pathway are shown in box 2.

the recent discovery that homo- and heterodimerizations of seven-transmembrane receptors were not an
exception, but rather a universal rule, opened a large
number of routes for investigation, in the sense that these
homodimerizations, but more particularly heterodimerizations between unrelated receptors, might change the
current and classical views of the molecular pharmacology
of receptors [67]. melatonin receptors undergo these
associations [68] and further studies will be needed to
clarify the molecular data because these dimerizations
might change the behaviour of agonists and antagonists.
