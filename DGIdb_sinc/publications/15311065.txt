abstract

purpose: overactive bladder symptoms due to various etiologies have been successfully treated
with capsaicin by desensitization of the temperature sensitive  xxxd428xxx  receptor trpv1. recently another temperature sensitive receptor,  xxxg2334xxx , activated by menthol and cool temperatures (8c to 28c) was described that may be the proposed cool receptor, at least in part
mediating the bladder response in the diagnostic ice water test. we defined the sites of mrna
and protein expression of  xxxg2334xxx  and trpv1 in the rat and human genitourinary tract.
materials and methods: prostate, testis, penis, bladder and dorsal root ganglion tissue was
obtained from rats. prostate, testicle, seminiferous tubules, corpus cavernosum, glans, overlying
glans skin, scrotal skin and bladder were obtained from human patients. reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction was done using species specific primers for  xxxg2334xxx  and trpv1.
immunofluorescence staining for  xxxg2334xxx  was performed in rat tissues as well as in cultured
human urothelial cells.
results:  xxxg2334xxx  and trpv1 mrna were detected in all rat tissues. human samples demonstrated  xxxg2334xxx  mrna in prostate, testicle, seminiferous tubules, scrotal skin and bladder. no
 xxxg2334xxx  mrna was identified in human corpus cavernosum, glans or overlying glans skin.
separation of layers in human bladder demonstrated mrna for  xxxg2334xxx  only in the urothelium
and not in the detrusor. immunofluorescence location of  xxxg2334xxx  was found in rat prostate, drg
and bladder, and in human urothelial cells in culture. trpv1 mrna was detected in all human
genitourinary tract tissues.
conclusions: these results demonstrate that mrna and protein for  xxxg2334xxx  exist in multiple
genitourinary organs in the rat and human, and it may be considered a possible new target, as
is trpv1, for the pharmacological treatment of detrusor overactivity or other urological disorders.

the existence of bladder receptors sensitive to cold temperature has been hypothesized for decades and yet the identity
of these receptors has eluded investigators.1–5 in 1957 bors
and blinn reported a human bladder cooling reflex (bcr),
consisting of immediate detrusor contraction in response to
intravesical ice water infusion in subjects with spinal upper
motor neuron lesions.6 investigations in the cat have suggested that bladder thermosensation involves an association
of cold sensitive receptors and unmyelinated c-fiber afferent
neurons.2 intravesical infusion of a  xxxd2565xxx  was
shown to increase the threshold temperature needed to trigger c-fibers in cats, suggesting that these responses were
likely mediated by a receptor sensitive to cold and menthol.3
a group using intravesical infusion of menthol in humans
with a positive bcr noted similar sensitization of the detru-

sor contractile response, suggesting that cold and menthol
sensitive receptors also exist in the human bladder.4
until recently the identity of a receptor that is activated by
cold temperatures had not been described. in 2002, 2 groups
reported a nonselective cation channel sensitive to cold temperatures and menthol,  xxxg2334xxx .7, 8 the receptor belongs to
the temperature sensitive trp channel family, which includes warm temperature and capsaicin sensitive trpv1.9
recently there has been clinical interest in compounds
such as capsaicin and  xxxd3101xxx  for their abilities to
desensitize c-fibers and provide relief in patients with detrusor overactivity.10, 11 a cool receptor in the same receptor
family that is also associated with c-fibers may be an additional or preferred therapeutic target in the future. to date in
the human genitourinary (gu) tract transcripts for  xxxg2334xxx 
receptors have been identified only in the prostate using in
situ hybridization.12 we report the detailed tissue distribution of mrna and protein for  xxxg2334xxx  receptor as well as
trpv1 in the rat and human gu tracts.

l5 to s1) from 3 rats were also collected as positive controls for  xxxg2334xxx  receptor. tissues from the testicle (tunica
albuginea and seminiferous tubules), seminiferous tubules, corpus cavernosum, glans, overlying glans skin and
scrotal skin were obtained from a human patient undergoing gender reassignment surgery. human prostate was
obtained from a patient undergoing transurethral prostate
resection and bladder samples were obtained from 4 patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. radical retropubic prostatectomy specimens were obtained
from the posterior bladder neck. division of urothelium
from detrusor layers was performed using microdissection
techniques. acquisition of all human specimens was performed under an institutional tissue banking protocol and
consent was obtained from all patients.
tissue preparation. good separation of bladder urothelium from detrusor layers was assured by histochemistry
after fixation of part of the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate buffered saline (pbs). cryoprotection was
achieved by placing specimens in 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose/
pbs on consecutive days. specimens were then embedded
in optimal cutting temperature compound (sakura
finetek, torrance, california) and snap frozen on dry ice.
using a microtome, 10 to 14 ␮m cryosections were made
and mounted on glass slides. slides were then stained with
hematoxylin and eosin, cover slips were affixed and light
microscopy was used for inspection.
reverse transcriptase (rt)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
total rna was extracted from every tissue using trizol reagent (gibco brl, life technologies, grand island, new york)
according to the manufacturer suggested protocol. the reverse
transcription step (60 minutes at 42c) was done on 2 ␮g total
rna using oligo- xxxd3364xxx  and mmlv rt (promega,
madison, wisconsin). due to high sequence homology pcr
could be performed using identical oligonucleotide primers for
human and rat  xxxg2334xxx  (see table). species specific trpv1
primers were used for pcr and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) primers were used as an internal
loading control. for pcr denaturation (1 minute at 95c), annealing (1 minute at 60c) and elongation (1 minute at 72c)
were done for 35 cycles. separation and analysis of pcr products were done using 1.5% agarose gels and ethidium bromide
staining. dilution of cdna prior to pcr was 1⫻ for  xxxg2334xxx , 20
to 200⫻ for trpv1 and 1,000⫻ for  xxxg861xxx . preliminary data
showed that these conditions rendered amplification that was
less than saturated for all 3 genes analyzed.
cdna sequencing. gel bands were isolated with a scalpel
blade and cdna was purified with a wizard pcr preps dna
purification system (promega) according to the manufacturer protocol. purified cdna was then sequenced at the
university core facility.
cell culture. human urothelial cells were cultured with
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in a 5% co2 incubator at 37c.
development of a more differentiated culture was achieved in
serum-free conditions, as described by rossi et al.13 for immunocytochemistry cells were plated in 4-well chamber glass
slides (lab-tek ii, nalge nunc, naperville, illinois) in the
corresponding medium and fixed 72 hours later in 4% paraformaldehyde.
immunofluorescence. rat tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryopreserved in sucrose gradient and cryosectioned to 10 ␮m.  xxxg2334xxx  was detected with rabbit polyclonal

0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 0.5% tween 20 in pbs),
using alexa fluor 546 goat antirabbit igg (molecular probes,
eugene, oregon), diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. nuclei
were stained with  xxxd2284xxx  (bisbenzimide, sigma
chemical co., st. louis, missouri). nonspecific staining was
assessed without the primary antibody. pictures were recorded using an olympus bx-51 microscope equipped with
an olympus magnafire digital camera (olympus, melville,
new york).
results

using rt-pcr mrna for rat  xxxg2334xxx  receptor was detected in testis, prostate, penis and bladder tissue as well as
in drg (fig. 1, a). in human tissue  xxxg2334xxx  transcripts were
identified in testicle, seminiferous tubules, scrotal skin, prostate, and bladder urothelium and detrusor samples. no
 xxxg2334xxx  mrna was noted in corpus cavernosum, glans or
overlying glans skin (fig. 1, b). further separation of urothelium from underlying detrusor in human bladder samples
demonstrated that  xxxg2334xxx  transcripts existed only in the
urothelial layer with none in the detrusor (fig. 2, a and b).
purification and sequencing of the 570 bp cdna product from
agarose gels demonstrated 98% homology to the corresponding sequence in the  xxxg2334xxx  gene (data not shown).
figure 3 shows the localization of  xxxg2334xxx  in rat tissues by
fluorescence immunohistochemistry. clearly positive staining was noted in most drg neurons, in scattered prostatic
stromal cells and in the most luminal side of bladder urothelium (fig. 3, a to f). other rat tissues analyzed (penis and
testicle) showed inconclusive staining results inconsistent

with rt-pcr data (data not shown). human urothelial cells
in culture also showed positive staining for  xxxg2334xxx  with
higher intensity staining in cells that were induced to a more
differentiated state by culturing in serum-free conditions (fig.
3, g to j).
rat trpv1 mrna was noted in all tissues studied, including testicle, prostate, penis, bladder and drg (fig. 4, a).
transcripts for human trpv1 were also noted in all tissues,
including testicle, seminiferous tubules, corpus cavernosum,
glans, overlying glans skin, scrotal skin, prostate, and bladder urothelium and detrusor (fig. 4, b). trpv1 mrna was
further observed in urothelium and detrusor after separation
of the layers (fig. 2, c).
discussion

since the bcr was described in 1957, temperature receptors in the bladder have been hypothesized.6 lindstrom and
mazieres,3 and geirsson et al4 performed studies suggesting
that there are cold and menthol sensitive receptors primarily
associated with unmyelinated c-fibers in the cat and human
bladders. the reason for the existence of these receptors in
the bladder is only speculative but it could be related to
regulation of the body core temperature by signalling the
bladder to contract and excrete a thermal load.3
patients with upper motor neuron lesions experience an

interruption of the normal a␦ mediated spinal-bulbar-spinal
micturition pathway.14 subsequently a lower motor neuron
segmental reflex involving c-fiber afferents, and associated
with cool and hot receptors becomes the dominant micturition pathway and it is likely the reason for a positive bcr.
support for these mechanisms is suggested by evidence that
infants younger than 4 years who have an immature spinalbulbar-spinal pathway also have a positive bcr. it is hypothesized that chronic bladder pathological states, such as obstructive cystopathy and interstitial cystitis, result in a
recruitment of c-fibers with an increase in their contribution
to the micturition pathway.15 this is likely the reason that
intravesical capsaicin has demonstrated therapeutic benefits
for detrusor overactivity in patients with chronic bladder
irritative and neurological pathologies.10, 11 the identification and characterization of c-fiber associated cool receptors
theoretically provides an additional target for future overactive bladder pharmacotherapy.

likely that it does have a large role in temperature sensation
and the c-fiber micturition pathway. furthermore, the wide
gu tissue distribution of  xxxd2565xxx  receptors that we
described suggests many other roles of these receptors in
normal and pathological urological conditions.

identified in the prostate.12 interestingly the same group
noted that the number of  xxxg2334xxx  transcripts was increased
in malignancies, including prostate, breast and colon cancer.
to our knowledge ours is the first known report identifying a
bladder cool receptor, which may be the putative receptor
mediating the bcr. we further observed that this receptor
mrna and protein only exist within the bladder urothelial
layer. this makes sense conceptually because a cold fluid
load would be in direct contact with the urothelial layer and
a subsequent stimulated reflex would encourage the expulsion of that thermal ballast.
the additional findings of cool and hot receptor mrna in
the rat and human testis, and in human scrotal skin may be
related to the thermosensitivity of the positioning of the
testes close to or far from the body depending on the ambient
temperature. this may provide some insight into male factor
infertility as we further characterize the location and role of
these receptors within these tissues.
previously the human and rat trpv1 receptor had only
been investigated and identified in kidney and bladder
within the gu tract.16, 17 we report the existence of trpv1
mrna throughout the gu system in multiple tissues. furthermore, the level of expression of the hot receptor is much
higher compared to the cool receptor since we diluted cdna
as many as 200 times to yield similar density bands after
performing rt-pcr. the wide tissue expression pattern of
trpv1 receptors could be useful for treating other disorders,
including but not limited to premature ejaculation and prostatitis, especially with well tolerated agonists such as  xxxd3101xxx .
conclusions

since the characterization of trpv1 receptor (sensitive to
temperature greater than 43c) in 1997, another 5 temperature sensitive receptors have been identified.18  xxxg2334xxx  is
activated by temperatures of 8c to 28c, while the more
recently described channel  xxxg2331xxx  is activated by even
lower temperatures.19 until more studies are performed it is
difficult to ascribe the bcr only to  xxxg2334xxx  but with its tissue
distribution in the rat bladder and human urothelium it is
