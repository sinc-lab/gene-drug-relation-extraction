experimental evidence for  xxxg786xxx  control of blastema cell proliferation during limb regeneration of the amphibian pleurodeles waltl.  during regeneration, blastema cell proliferation depends on several different factors which are, as yet, not fully understood. previous studies showing the presence of  xxxg786xxx  and fgf receptors in the limb blastema make  xxxg786xxx  a potentially important molecule for limb regeneration but they do not demonstrate that this factor is active during the process. in the present study, we have first of all confirmed the presence of  xxxg786xxx  in limb blastemas of the amphibian pleurodeles waltl using immunochemistry. second, we provide evidence in vivo that  xxxg786xxx  controls blastema cell proliferation by using different reagents which interfere with fgf activity. sulfated polysaccharides which bind fgfs, such as heparin, iota-carrageenan and  xxxd2878xxx , are able to decrease both 3h-thymidine incorporation and the mitotic index in regeneration blastemas. in addition,  xxxd3266xxx  which inhibits the binding of growth factors to their receptors, induces the same effect. the presence of receptors in blastema cells is also demonstrated by using the fgf-saporin complex which is known to bind to fgf receptors and to kill cells bearing these receptors. this complex decreases the mitotic index in mesenchyme, while saporin alone did not influence cell proliferation. finally, results obtained using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against  xxxg786xxx  which was able to specifically reduce blastema cell proliferation, suggests that  xxxg786xxx  plays an important function in limb regeneration.
