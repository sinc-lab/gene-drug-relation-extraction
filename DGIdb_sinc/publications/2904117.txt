the relative selectivity of anticholinergic
drugs for the m l and m2 muscarinic
receptor subtypes

summary: anticholinergic drugs are used to treat a number of neurologic disorders, inctuding parkinsonism, vestibular disturbances, and dystonia. traditionally, these drugs have been thought to act in similar fashion, as competitive
antagonists at a single class of muscarink receptors, and not to differ significantly in their therapeutic efficacy. recently, however, pharmacoiogic studies
have shown that the novel antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  is capable of recognizing
heterogeneity among muscarinic receptors; high-affinity  xxxd2965xxx  sites have
been classified as mi sites and low-affinity sites as m2. this study examined
whether the anticholinergics currently available for treatment of neurologic
symptoms have selectivity for these subtypes and whether they differ in their
degree of selectivity; the study showed that these drugs do demonstrate selectivity. all had greater affinity for the mi site, indicated by higher affinity for
rat forebrain membranes, where m1 predominates, than hindbrain preparations, where m2 predominates. the degree of sefectivity vaned greatly; some
compounds, such as  xxxd2055xxx , had little m1 selectivity, whereas others,
such as scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, and biperiden, were quite selective,
like  xxxd2965xxx . it is unknown whether these differences in selectivity have
any immediate therapeutic implications. however, these results support the
emerging concept of muscarinic receptor subtypes and the prospect of developing more selective agents, with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. key words:
anticholinergic- muscarinic- receptor- subtypes

anticholinergic drugs have been used for many years to treat a number of neurologic conditions, including parkinsonism (11, acute dystonic reactions (2), and
vestibular disorders (3). more recently, high-dosage anticholinergic therapy has
been shown to be effective in the treatment of primary and secondary dystonias
(43.the traditional concept of anticholinergic pharmacology is that, while these
drugs differ in potency and in their noncholinergic pharmacology, such as their

effect on dopamine reuptake (6), they are all competitive antagonists at a single
muscarinic receptor site and have similar clinical efficacy. this concept has been
supported by studies in a number of pharmacologic paradigms, in both central
and peripheral nervous systems, which have shown similar potency ratios-among
anticholinergics, indicating interaction with a single type of muscarinic receptor
(7). in addition, radioligand binding studies have shown interaction of classic
muscarinic antagonists with a single class of receptor sites (8).
however, some earlier evidence was inconsistent with this concept.  xxxd2174xxx 
was demonstrated to have, in addition to its nicotinic blocking properties, antimuscarinic effects that were selective for the heart (9). another compound, 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpipendine (.i-damp), was shown to have greater affinity for ileum than heart (10). even among classic muscarink antagonists, there
has been evidence suggesting heterogeneity in binding; small, but definite, differences in affinity for forebrain and hindbrain membrane preparations have been
reported ( i i).
more recently, substantial evidence has shown that the novel muscarinic antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  recognizes heterogeneity among muscarinic receptors (12). indirect receptor binding studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2965xxx  has different
affinities for different peripheral tissues and brain regions, with a higher affinity
for forebrain than hindbrain (12). this evidence has been supported by direct
studies of [3h]- xxxd2965xxx  binding in both homogenate (13- 15) and intact tissue
preparations (16), which have shown a greater proportion of high-affinity sites in
forebrain than hindbrain. pharmacologic studies have also shown selective effects
of  xxxd2965xxx  on functional responses.  xxxd2965xxx  is a more potent inhibitor of
gastric acid secretion (17) and ganglionic stimulation (18) than an inducer of
tachycardia. in brain, it is a more potent antagonist of acetylcholine at presynaptic receptors regulating dopamine release than at those regulating acetylcholine
reiease (autoreceptors) (19). based on evidence for a selective action of  xxxd2965xxx , a nomenclature of mi (high-affinity) and m2 (low-affinity) muscarinic receptor subtypes has been proposed (18).
this study addressed whether currently available anticholinergics are selective
for the mi and m2 muscarinic receptor subtypes, and if they are, whether they
differ in their pattern and degree of selectivity. these questions have been approached by studying the ability of these drugs to inhibit the binding of a potent
muscannic antagonist ligand, [3h]-quinuclidinylbenzilate([3h]qnb), in rat forebrain and hindbrain membrane preparations. the relative affinity of these drugs
for these two membrane preparations can be used as a measure of their selectivity
for the mi and  xxxg448xxx  subtypes because of the greater number of mi sites in
forebrain and m2 sites in hindbrain ( 1 3- 15).
materials and methods

muscarinic receptor binding was performed as described by yamamura and
snyder (20) with minor modifications. on the day of assay, a male spraguedawley rat (200-225 g, charles river laboratories, wilmington, ma, u.s.a.)
was killed by decapitation and its brain rapidly removed. the brain was transected by a midcollicular cut. all brain tissue anterior to the transection was

defined as forebrain, and all posterior tissue (including cerebellum) was defined
as hindbrain. regions were weighed and homogenized in 20.0 ml of 50 mm trishc1 (ph 7.7) with a polytron (brinkman, westbury, ny) at setting no. 6 for 15 s.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 10 min, and the supernatant
was discarded. the homogenization and centrifugation steps were then repeated,
the supernatant discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 volumes per
original wet weight 50 mm nakpo, (ph 7.4). forebrain and hindbrain membrane
preparations from a single rat were prepared in parallel for each assay. aliquots
(100 p1; 26 -t 0.5 pg protein) of this membrane preparation were incubated with
120 pm t3h]~-qnb
(amersham, arlington heights, il; batch 20; 38 cummol), in
the presence or absence of varying concentrations of unlabeled anticholinergic
drug, in 50 mm nakpo, (ph 7.4), at a final volume of 4.0 ml,for 60 min at 37°c.
the incubation was stopped by addition of 5.0 ml iced nakpo, buffer, followed
by immediate filtration through glass fiber fdters (whatman gf/b, 2.5 cm) under
vacuum and then two additional washes with 5.0 ml of iced buffer. filters were
then air dried and placed in vials with 10.0 ml aquasol (new england nuclear,
boston, ma). after at least a 6-h delay, radioactivity was determined by liquid
scintillation spectrophotometry at an efficiency of 38%. nonspecific binding was
defined by the addition of 1 p m  xxxd247xxx ; 100% specific binding was defined as binding in the absence of an unlabeled competing ligand minus nonspecific binding.
the ability of each drug to inhibit the binding of [3h]qnb in forebrain and
hindbrain was studied in parallel in each experiment; points were determined in

were averaged for all experiments and expressed as logit-log curves, which were
analyzed by linear regression analysis. the concentration of each drug required
to inhibit [3h]qnb binding by 50% (ic50)was determined from the linear regression analysis. the inhibition constant (ki) for each drug in both brain regions was
calculated from the icso values, using the cheng and prusoff equation (21) and
empirically determined kd values for [3h]qnb binding in forebrain (22  xxxg1653xxx ) and
hindbrain (28 pm). the confidence interval about each linear regression was determined with the use of clinfo software.

that affinity data correspond to clinical potency, i.e., atropine and scopolamine are greater than benztropine, biperiden, and trihexyphenidyl, which are greater than  xxxd2055xxx  and orphenadrine. (abbreviations: nms, n-methyl scopolamine; dex, dexetirnide; atr, atropine; stop, scopolamine; meth,

fig. 1b for  xxxd2055xxx . as reported by others for  xxxd2965xxx  (12), there is a
nine-fold higher affinity for forebrain than hindbrain membrane preparations.
also consistent with the findings of others (12), the hill coefficient for competitive displacement of [3h]qnb in forebrain is significantly less than 1 .o (hill coefficient (n, = 0.77), indicating an interaction with more than one site, whereas
this coefficient in hindbrain is approximately equal to i .o (n, = 1.1 ;p < 0.005 for
the difference in slopes). among the compounds studied,  xxxd2055xxx  shows
one of the smallest affinity differences between forebrain and hindbrain membrane preparations. nevertheless, as shown by the 95% confidence bands in fig.
lb, there is a significant difference in affinity for these two brain regions (p <
0.001), with a greater affinity for forebrain.
all compounds studied showed a significantly higher affinity for forebrain
membrane preparations, indicating an ability to distinguish muscarinic receptor
subtypes. the competition binding data for all compounds for forebrain membranes are shown in fig. 2. the affinity relationships depicted are comparable
with those reported by others in ligand binding experiments; i.e., dexetimide
greater than atropine ( 2 2 ) ; atropine greater than scopolamine (8); and n-methyl
scopolamine very much greater than  xxxd2965xxx  (12). these affinity relationships
also correspond reasonably well to clinical potency, judged from typical daily
doses in a variety of indications (3): atropine and scopolamine greater than benztropine, biperiden, and trihexyphenidyl, which are greater than  xxxd2055xxx 
and orphenadrine. competition binding data for these compounds for hindbrain
membranes is shown in fig. 3. while rank order of potency remains largely the
same in hindbrain preparations, it is also apparent that a number of affinity relationships among these compounds have changed, when expressed as difference in
absolute affinity values. while scopolamine .has only slightly lower affinity than
atropine in forebrain preparations, it has a 2.3-fold lower affinity in hindbrain,
trihexyphenidyl and biperiden have considerably greater affinity than ethopropa-

scopolamine has shifted in its affinity relationship to  xxxd2597xxx ; trihexyphenidyl and biperiden have
shifted to be almost equipotent to  xxxd2055xxx . (see fig. 2 for explanation of abbreviations.)

zine for forebrain preparations, whereas they are only slightly more potent in
hindbrain preparations.
these differences in affinities for fore- and hindbrain membrane preparations
are presented quantitatively in table i and in fig. 4. in table 1, compounds are
listed in the rank order of their affinity to forebrain membrane preparations. this
rank order is largely preserved for the affinity of the compounds to hindbrain
preparations, with the exception of scopolamine, which is less potent than  xxxd2597xxx  for hindbrain binding. further information is provided by the ratio of
hindbrain affinity (kih)to forebrain affinity (kif), which provides an index of
selectivity for the mi site. the highest ratio is for  xxxd2965xxx  at 8.5, as reported
(12). some anticholinergics, particularly scopolamine, biperiden, and trihexyphenidyl, are similar to  xxxd2965xxx  in their mi selectivity. others, however, have
a relatively low ratio, and they, therefore, are relatively less selective, including
orphenadrine and  xxxd2055xxx . no compound had a selectivity ratio less than
1.0, i.e., none had a higher affinity for hindbrain preparations and thus none
seemed selective for the m2 site.

discussion
these results demonstrate that these clinically available anticholinergics differ
in their receptor binding affinity, and that there is an ordinal correlation between
their affinity and clinical potency, as expected.

compounds are listed in descending order of affinity for forebrain membrane
preparations. for each compound, the inhibition constant (k,) has been determined for each region from ic,, values with the use of the cheng and prusoff
equation (21) and empirically determined kd values for [%i]qnb for each region
(forebrain kd = 22 pm; hindbrain k, = 28 pm). a 95% confidence interval for
each ki was determined from the linear regression analysis. for each compound a
ratio of k,, hindbrainik,, and forebrain was determined; higher values signify a
greater affinity for the mi site. for this ratio, a 90% confidence interval has been
computed based on possible maximum and minimum values of k,, and k,, within
their respective 95% confidence intervals.

of greater interest is the demonstration that ail of these drugs, like  xxxd2965xxx ,
have a greater affinity for forebrain than hindbrain membrane preparations. the
most likely explanation for this affinity difference, based on the concept of m1
and m2 receptors defined by  xxxd2965xxx  binding, is that these drugs have a
greater affinity for the m1 site, and its preponderance in forebrain accounts for
the higher affinity in that region. none of these drugs had a higher affinity for
hindbrain membranes, and thus none seems to be m2 selective.
it is important to emphasize that although the affinity difference of these compounds for fore- and hindbrain membrane preparations provides a useful relative
measure of their m1/m2 selectivity, it does not provide an absolute measure.
although forebrain, as defined here, contains predominantly the m 1 subtype,
some structures included in the forebrain tissue contain m2 sites (e.g., the superior colliculus and the medial septum (23). likewise, although hindbrain, as dis-

142

sected here, contains predominantly the m2 subtype, there is autoradiographically demonstrable f3h]-pirenzepinebinding (mi) in several hindbrain structures,
including the hypoglossal nucleus and other cranial nerve nuclei (16). this admixture of m1 and m2 receptors in the two brain regions leads to an underestimate of
the actual selectivity for the two subtypes.  xxxd2965xxx , for example, shows a
10-fold difference in affhity for fore- and hindbrain membrane preparations, but
actually has a 100-fold difference in affinity for the two sites, based on direct
binding studies and computer modeling of inhibition data (13).
the present results demonstrate that these drugs vary in their selectivity for the
m1 site. some, such a s orphenadrine and  xxxd2055xxx , have minimal selectivity
for this site. others, however, such as scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, and biperiden, are like  xxxd2965xxx  in being rather selective for the m1 site.
it is unknown whether the difference in muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity
among these drugs has or will have clinical significance. in the treatment of parkinsonism, although these drugs have different potency, they seem to have similar
efficacy (24). in the treatment of focal dystonias,  xxxd2055xxx  may be better
tolerated by adults than trihexyphenidyl, with fewer cerebral side effects such as
forgetfulness and confusion (4). it is of interest, in view of this observation, that
trihexyphenidyl is not only more potent than  xxxd2055xxx , but considerably
more selective for the mi subtype. the mi subtype predominates in cortex and
hippocampus, and it might be expected to play a greater role in learning and
memory. some animal data support a role for the m1 subtype in learning (25).
however, a difference between trihexyphenidyl and  xxxd2055xxx  in the treatment of adult dystonias has not been rigorously established, and even if this difference were clear, other pharmacologic differences between the two drugs, beside their subtype selectivity, could account for'a difference in therapeutic index.
in most clinicai applications of these drugs, it is difficult to anticipate how the
subtype selectivity demonstrated here could be exploited to therapeutic advantage, because the subtypes that mediate benefit and adverse effects are unknown.
one use of anticholinergics, where it may be worthwhile to explore a different
therapeutic index among these drugs, based on their differences in selectivity, is
in the treatment of  xxxd1892xxx  and vestibular disorders. scopolamine is effective in the treatment of  xxxd1892xxx  (26,27). major adverse effects of scopolamine are confusion and forgetfulness, which are due to its anticholinergic
properties. benefit is probably mediated by an anticholinergic effect, and while
the precise site of action is unknown, it is believed to be the central vestibular
nuclei (28). based on autoradiographic studies, the vestibular nuclei are likely to
contain predominantly the  xxxg448xxx  subtype (16,231. if, indeed, anticholinergics mediate benefit at m2 receptors at this site, then it is possible that drugs
such as orphenadrine or  xxxd2055xxx , which have less effect at the  xxxg447xxx , may provide equal benefit with fewer cerebral side effects than scopolamine, which is mi selective.
the major implication of these findings is not that these particular drugs may
differ in their therapeutic index for the treatment of neurological disorders, but
rather that it should be feasible to develop anticholinergics with greater subtype

selectivity and to exploit this selectivity in clinical therapeutics. while none of
these drugs was m2 selective, radioligand binding studies have demonstrated for
 xxxd2174xxx  that it may be an mzselective antagonist (29), and it is possible that
clinically useful m2 antagonists may be found. these considerations also apply to
the clinical pharmacology of cholinergic agonists, some of which differ in their
selectivity for muscarinic receptor subtypes (3oj 1). the development of selective cholinergics and anticholinergics should not only enhance clinical therapeutics with these agents but should also provide some information about their
site of action in brain, given the heterogeneous regional localization of muscarink
receptor subtypes in brain.
