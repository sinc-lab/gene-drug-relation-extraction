abstract
the level of aromatase in the preoptic area of rats is transcriptionally regulated through a specific androgen-receptor mediated
mechanism and can be used as a measure of central androgenic effect. therefore, several commonly abused anabolic–androgenic steroids
žaas. were tested for their ability to induce aromatase activity in the preoptic area of castrated rats. in addition, we determined the
relative binding affinities of these compounds for the  xxxg183xxx , as well as their ability to bind  xxxg183xxx  in vivo
following subcutaneous injections. all of the aas compounds tested significantly stimulated poa aromatase activity above castrate
levels. the compounds that produced the greatest stimulation of aromatase activity were those that bound most avidly to the androgen
receptor in vitro ži.e., testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and nandrolone.. in contrast, the 17a-alkylated compounds that were tested
žstanozolol,  xxxd1806xxx , methandrostenolone. modestly stimulated aromatase and were weak competitors for the  xxxg183xxx . the
subcutaneous injection of aas compounds increased the concentrations of occupied nuclear androgen receptors in the brain, but the
magnitude of effect was not related to their potency for inducing aromatase or their relative binding affinity for the  xxxg183xxx 
suggesting that  xxxg183xxx  occupancy in poa is not correlated with the action of androgen on aromatase. the present results help
explain the behavioral effects of aas compounds in rats. q 1998 elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
anabolic–androgenic steroids žaas. are synthetic
derivatives of testosterone, which are taken in high doses
by athletes with the intention of enhancing their muscular
appearance andror athletic performance. despite the
well-documented adverse cardiovascular and hepatic effects of these compounds, their misuse has become a
prevalent substance abuse problem that is beginning to
effect a younger generation of athletes. at present it is
estimated that more than one million individuals, some as
young as high school-age students, have used aas in the
usa w11,15,31,33x.
aas compounds are therapeutically useful in androgen
replacement therapy and as chemotherapeutics for certain
types of cancer w26,32x. chemical modification of the

have led to the identification of novel steroids which differ
from testosterone in their ability to stimulate the development of male secondary sexual characteristics ži.e., androgenic effects. vs. their ability to stimulate muscular hypertrophy and nitrogen retention ži.e., anabolic effects.. the
androgenic:anabolic ratio of an androgen is an important
consideration when determining the clinical usefulness of
these compounds. accordingly, compounds with a high
ratio of androgenic to anabolic effects remain the drug of
choice in androgen-replacement therapy to treat hypogonadism in males, whereas compounds with reduced androgenic:anabolic ratios have significant benefits in the treatment of other medical conditions, in which their primary
clinical application is for their anabolic effects že.g., anemia, osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following
trauma, surgery or prolonged immobilization. w12x.
the doses and combinations of aas compounds used
by athletes are usually in large excess ž10–100 fold. of
therapeutic doses. recent evidence suggests that at such
high doses, aas compounds can alter sexual behavior and
reproductive physiology in males w31x. controlled studies
in rodents demonstrated that aas compounds have dis-

tinct behavioral and physiological actions and vary in
terms of their androgenic potency w5,8,10,18,19x. it is
currently believed that masculine sexual behavior in rats is
dependent on both  xxxg183xxx  activation and the
transformation of testosterone to estrogen by cytochrome
p450 aromatase in target neurons of the preoptic area, an
area that is essential for the expression of masculine sexual
behavior w7,29x. moreover, androgens regulate the expression of poa aromatase mrna and enzyme activity through
an  xxxg183xxx -specific mechanism w1,22x. in the
case of testosterone, this constitutes a feed-forward system,
since testosterone is both the regulator and major substrate
of aromatase. hence, the actions of aas in the brain are
complex and the final response depends not only on their
interaction with androgen receptors, but also on their ability to regulate andror act as substrate for aromatase.
the present study examined whether selective aas
steroids can regulate aromatase in the preoptic area. moreover, to determine whether these aas act through the
 xxxg183xxx  in brain, we compared the relative binding affinities of selected compounds, as well as their
ability to bind androgen receptors in vivo following subcutaneous administration.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and treatments
male sprague–dawley rats purchased from simonsen
breeders žgilroy, ca. were maintained on a 12 h light:12
h dark schedule with food and water available ad libitum.
to study the effect of treatment with different aas compounds on poa aromatase activity, 40 adult males ž220–
240 g at the start of the experiment. were randomly
assigned to one of the following treatment groups ž5
ratsrgroup.: ž1. castrated žcx.; ž2. intact žint.; ž3. cx
q testosterone žt. 1 ; ž4. cx q dihydrotestosterone ždht.;
ž5. cx q stanozolol; ž6. cx q nandrolone; ž7. cx q
 xxxd1806xxx ; and ž8. cx q methandrostenolone. castrations
and sham surgeries were performed transcrotally under
ketamine ž55 mgrkg. –xylazene ž5 mgrkg. anesthesia.
immediately after surgery, the rats were given sc injections
of steroid ž4 mgrkg. or oil vehicle ž200 m l.. treatments
and vehicle injections were continued daily for 7 days.
approximately 24 h after the last injection all animals
were weighed and killed by decapitation. the brains were
rapidly removed and used fresh. the brain was dissected

the structural nomenclature for the aas compounds used in this
study are: dihydrotestosterone ždht., 5 a- xxxd3240xxx ;  xxxd1806xxx , 17 b -hydroxy-2,4,17 a -pregnadien-20-ynol w 2,3-d x isoxazole;
methandrostenolone, 1-dehydro-17a-methyl-testosterone; nandrolone ž19nor testosterone., 17b-hydroxy-4-estren-3-one; stanozolol, 17a-methyl5 a-androstano-w3,2-cxpyrazol-17b-ol; testosterone žt., 4- xxxd2618xxx -17bol-3-one.

according to previously published coordinates w13x. the
ventral prostates and levator ani were weighed to monitor
peripheral androgenic and anabolic effects. to determine
the competition of aas for androgen receptors and their
ability to displace bound hormone from receptor in the
brain and prostate, twelve additional gonadally intact adult
male rats were used. the brain tissue used in this experiment consisted of a combined dissection of the preoptic
area žpoa., hypothalamus, and amygdala ži.e., hpoa..
finally, to determine the ability of selected aas to activate androgen receptors in vivo following subcutaneous
administration, adult male rats were castrated and 48 h
later given subcutaneous injections ž4 mgrkg. of steroid
dissolved in sesame oil. two hours after the injections, the
rats were killed and androgen receptors were measured in
the poa and prostate. preliminary studies showed that
nuclear  xxxg183xxx  binding was maximal at the 2-h
time point ždata not shown..
2.2. aromatase assay
the poas from individual rats were homogenized in
dounce tissue grinders in 10 volumes of phosphate buffer
ž10 mm kh 2 po4 , 100 mm kcl, 1 mm edta, and 1 mm
dithiothreitol, ph 7.4.. aliquots of these homogenates
were incubated for 1 h at 37 c with w1 b- 3 hxandrostenedione žnen research products, dupont, boston, ma; specific activitys 27.5 cirmmol. in the presence of an
nadph generating system. aromatase activity was estimated by quantifying the amount of 3 h 2 o generated by
the stereospecific loss of the c-1 b tritium which is proportional to the amount of estrogen formed w21x. protein
concentrations were determined by the method of lowry et
al. w17x. aromatase activity was expressed as fmol hy1

the methods for measurement of cytosolic žarc. and
nuclear žarn. androgen receptors have been previously
described w20x. cytosols and kcl extracts of sucrose purified nuclei were prepared and incubated for 18–24 h with

pooled from 2–5 intact male rats. all competitors žtable

32-fold molar excess compared with the 3 h-labeled ligand,
with 2-fold differences between the concentrations. nonspecific binding was determined at a 200-fold excess of
unlabeled dht and the highest concentration of each
competitor. the relative binding affinity žrba. was calculated from logit–log plots as the ratio between the molar

3. results
a series of commonly misused aas compounds were
tested for their ability to induce aromatase activity in the
poa of castrated rats. all of the aas compounds used in
this study significantly increased poa aromatase activity
žfig. 1.. as expected, the naturally occurring androgens, t
and dht, maintained aromatase at levels comparable to
intact males. of the four other aas used, nandrolone had
the greatest effect on poa aromatase. after nandrolone
treatment the levels of aromatase activity were significantly greater than in castrates, but not different from rats
that were treated with t and dht. treatments with
stanozolol,  xxxd1806xxx , and methandrostenolone maintained
aromatase at intermediate levels that were significantly
greater than in castrates, but significantly less than in intact
males or castrates treated with t, dht, or nandrolone.
all of the aas compounds were tested in an in vitro
system as competitors for the  xxxg183xxx . w 3 hxdihydrotestosterone was used as the ligand. the study was
carried out in cytosolic and nuclear extracts from both the
brain ži.e., hpoa. and the prostate in order to make tissue
comparisons of the relative binding affinity for the receptor žtable 1.. of the steroids tested, the most efficient
competitor for the  xxxg183xxx  was dht itself žrelative binding affinitys 1.0 by definition.. this was true in
both cellular compartments from brain and prostate. dht
was followed by nandrolone and t in both tissues žrelative
binding affinitys 0.2 to 0.7.. the  xxxg183xxx  binding was weak žrelative binding affinity values - 0.01 to
0.08. for the 17a-methylated compounds, none of which
showed any differences in affinity between cellular compartments or tissues.
to verify the anabolic effect of the treatments, the
levator ani žla. and ventral prostate žvp. weights were
measured and the ratio of larvp was calculated as an

different from the castrate control.

estimate of the anabolic potency of the aas compounds
w14x. this ratio varied from 0.3 to 1.18 žtable 2., the
greater value is indicative of a greater anabolic or myotropic activity relative to androgenic activity. stanozolol,
nandrolone,  xxxd1806xxx , and methandrostenolone all had ratios close to 1, whereas the ratios for t and dht were 0.4
and 0.3, receptively. there was no significant effect of
treatment on body weights.
the concentrations of occupied arn that were measured in the poa and prostate 2 h after a single subcutaneous injection of aas compounds are shown in figs. 2
and 3, respectively. in the poa, all of the aas compounds significantly increased the concentration of occupied arn after injection. there were only subtle differences in effect, with a trend for t and nandrolone to be
most effective. in contrast, significant differences were
observed in the ability of the aas compounds to occupy

the present study clearly demonstrated that aas compounds act on the poa to stimulate aromatase activity. t
and its natural metabolite dht were equally effective at
inducing aromatase. of the synthetic aas compounds
studied, nandrolone was the most potent and stimulated
aromatase to the same extent as t and dht. the 17a-alkylated androgens, stanozolol,  xxxd1806xxx , and
methandrostenolone, were the least potent aas compounds with respect to stimulation of aromatase. in general, the potency for stimulation of poa aromatase was
related to the ability of these aas compounds to bind
 xxxg183xxx  in vitro. those aas compounds that
bound most avidly to the  xxxg183xxx  žt, dht, and
nandrolone. were more effective than those that were weak
competitors žstanozolol,  xxxd1806xxx , and methandrostenolone..
in contrast, there was no apparent relationship between
anabolic potency as measured by the ratio of levator ani
and ventral prostates weights žlarvp ratio. and the ability to induce poa aromatase.
the relative binding affinities of aas compounds for
the  xxxg183xxx  in the prostate have been reported
previously w16,24x. the data shown here are in general
agreement with these earlier studies and extend the analysis to the central nervous system. prostate and hpoa
exhibited the same rank order of potency for androgen
recep to r affin ity : d h t ) n an d ro lo n e ) t )
methandrostenolone f  xxxd1806xxx  f stanozolol. the more
planar 19-nor-androgen, nandrolone, was more potent than
t, while the 17-alkyl derivatives were all less potent.
all aas compounds tested in this study increased the
concentrations of occupied arn in the poa after subcutaneous administration, but the magnitude of effect was not
related to their potency for inducing aromatase or their
relative binding affinity for  xxxg183xxx . similarly,
the increased concentrations of occupied arn measured in
the ventral prostate after the subcutaneous injection of
aas compounds were not correlated with the relative
binding affinity of these steroids in this tissue. there were
also differences in the effectiveness with which the selected androgens increased concentrations of occupied arn
that differed between the prostate and poa and which may
result from differences in the metabolism of the steroids in
these tissues or the varied activities of the resultant
metabolites w3,27,31x. the lack of correlation between
receptor occupancy and biologic response ži.e., induction
of aromatase. may relate to the cellular heterogeneity of
poa tissue, in that androgen receptors may be involved in
more than one response that could each occur with a
different time course or within a distinct cellular popula-

c.e. rosellir brain research 792 (1998) 271–276

tion. it may also be due to differences in the distribution,
metabolism, andror clearance characteristics of different
aas compounds. it will be important for future studies to
address these possibilities. nevertheless, the present results
agree with the work of others studying the kidney, who
have also reported that concentrations of occupied arn do
not correlate with differential hormone responses in renal
tissue w2,6x.
comparison of the effects of aas compounds on sexual behavior in rats demonstrates a distinct pattern of
effectiveness which does not completely correlate with the
ability of these compounds to bind  xxxg183xxx  and
induce aromatase in the brain w8–10x. in general, 17amethylated aas compounds bind less avidly to androgen
receptors and have been reported to be less behaviorally
efficacious than t or nandrolone w9,10x. however, at least
one 17a-methylated compound, methandrostenolone, is capable of maintaining ejaculatory behavior in castrated rats
even though it binds poorly to the  xxxg183xxx  as
demonstrated in the current study. the reason for this
discrepancy is not known, but may relate to differences in
neuronal availability, metabolism, or clearance of various
17a-methylated compounds. moreover, it seems unlikely
that affinity for the  xxxg183xxx  alone explains the
behavioral efficacy of aas compounds since it is generally believed that aromatization plays a role in this process
as well w29x. thus, although dht and nandrolone bind
avidly to the  xxxg183xxx , only nandrolone can be
aromatized w23,28x. this capacity for aromatization may
explain, in part, why nandrolone can maintain ejaculatory
behavior, whereas dht can not w9,10,25x. finally, recent
evidence also demonstrates that nandrolone induces alkaline phosphatase activity in human endometrial adenocarcinoma ishikawa cells, a sensitive assay for estrogenic
activity w4x. direct binding of an androgen to hypothalamic
estrogen receptors has been demonstrated in vitro for
5 a-androstane-3 b ,17b-diol w30x. although not yet tested,
we cannot exclude the possibility that certain aas compounds or their metabolites bind estrogen receptors directly in brain to exert behavioral effects.
in conclusion, we have shown that the differential
effects of aas compounds on induction of aromatase
activity in the preoptic area correlates with their affinity
for the  xxxg183xxx  in brain. our data also suggest
that differences in the pattern of aas metabolism may
contribute to diversities in their biological effects. future
studies are needed to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms through which aas compounds act in neural tissues.
