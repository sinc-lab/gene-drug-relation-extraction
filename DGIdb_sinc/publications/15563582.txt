abstract
the  xxxg1871xxx  ( xxxg1871xxx ) receptor, a g protein-coupled
receptor that mediates chemotaxis of inflammatory cells in
response to  xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx ), is hypothesized to play a
role in th2-mediated allergic disease. in addition to  xxxg1073xxx ,
 xxxg1871xxx  can be activated by indomethacin, a nonselective
cyclooxygenase inhibitor and widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (nsaid). to evaluate the structural features
that confer  xxxg1871xxx  binding selectivity, structure-activity relationship analysis of arylacetic acid class nsaids as  xxxg1871xxx 
receptor ligands was performed. indomethacin,  xxxd3260xxx , and  xxxd3563xxx  displaced [3h] xxxg1073xxx  binding at the mouse
 xxxg1871xxx  receptor (mcrth2) with comparable affinity (ki ⫽ 1.5 ⫾
0.1, 2.5 ⫾ 0.4, and 3.3 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m, respectively). the indomethacin metabolite 5⬘-o- xxxd2352xxx  (5⬘-dmi) possessed binding affinity similar to indomethacin; however, elimination of the 2-methyl substituent on the indole ring resulted in

 xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx ), the predominant prostanoid produced by activated mast cells, is associated with allergic
diseases such as allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis
(lewis et al., 1982; murray et al., 1986; barr et al., 1988). the
biological effects of  xxxg1073xxx  are mediated by two distinct g
protein-coupled receptors: the d prostanoid receptor (dp)
and the recently discovered chemoattractant receptor-homolthis work was supported by grants from the national institutes of health

a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity. no binding was detected
for indole acetic acid and indole derivatives such as tryptophan,
serotonin, and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid, demonstrating the
importance of the n-acyl moiety of indomethacin. neutral derivatives of indomethacin also failed to bind to mcrth2, suggesting that the negatively charged carboxylate moiety participates in a key ligand-receptor interaction. despite similar
binding affinities, nsaid-type mcrth2 ligands exhibited variable potencies as mcrth2 agonists.  xxxd3260xxx  and 5⬘dmi inhibited intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  ([camp]i) generation and
stimulated cell migration comparable with indomethacin. in
contrast,  xxxd3563xxx  did not inhibit [camp]i generation or stimulate cell migration but weakly antagonized the effects of indomethacin on [camp]i. together, these results reveal structural
features of arylacetic acid nsaids that may be exploited for the
development of selective  xxxg1871xxx  ligands.

ogous molecule expressed on th2 cells ( xxxg1871xxx ). despite
binding  xxxg1073xxx  with high affinity, the  xxxg1871xxx  receptor does
not share significant sequence homology with the dp or other
prostanoid receptors; instead, it exhibits greatest sequence
similarity to chemoattractant receptors such as the formyl
peptide receptor (hirai et al., 2001). in humans, the  xxxg1871xxx 
receptor is expressed on th2 cells and eosinophils (nagata et
al., 1999a,b) which are well known to play a role in the
pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as allergic asthma
(hamid et al., 2003). in vitro activation of  xxxg1871xxx  stimulates
chemotaxis of human th2 cells, eosinophils and basophils
and in vivo activation leads to leukocyte mobilization in rats
(hirai et al., 2001; shichijo et al., 2003), suggesting that
 xxxg1871xxx  may mediate recruitment of inflammatory cells in

response to  xxxg1073xxx  generated in the setting of allergic inflammation.
although the precise role of  xxxg1871xxx  in allergic disease has
yet to be fully elucidated, emerging data suggest that it may
mediate proinflammatory effects of  xxxg1073xxx . therefore, the
generation of selective and specific  xxxg1871xxx  antagonists is of
interest as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of
allergic disease. it was recently reported that ramatroban,
initially described as a thromboxane receptor antagonist and
marketed for allergic rhinitis in japan, has significant
 xxxg1871xxx  antagonist activity and can inhibit  xxxg1073xxx -stimulated
eosinophil migration in vitro (sugimoto et al., 2003). consistent with this finding, ramatroban was observed to inhibit
antigen-induced mucosal eosinophilia in sensitized guinea
pigs (narita et al., 1996), an effect unlikely to be caused by
direct inhibition of thromboxane receptor receptors on eosinophils. at present, however, no truly  xxxg1871xxx -selective antagonist has been reported.
indomethacin is an arylacetic acid class nonselective cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitor and widely prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). in addition to suppressing prostaglandin formation by inhibiting cox,
indomethacin is known to possess cox-independent activity
such as suppression of malignant transformation of embryonic fibroblasts (zhang et al., 1999) and activation of the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ␣ and ␥ (lehmann et al., 1997). indomethacin has also been shown to be
an agonist at the  xxxg1871xxx  receptor and to stimulate shape
change,  xxxg1206xxx  up-regulation, and chemotaxis of eosinophils
(hirai et al., 2002; stubbs et al., 2002). this novel activity of
indomethacin is not shared by other nsaids such as aspirin
or ibuprofen. we have reported that indomethacin and  xxxd3259xxx , also an arylacetic acid nsaid, can bind to the mouse
 xxxg1871xxx  receptor (mcrth2), suggesting that arylacetic acid
class nsaids possess a unique structural motif that allows
binding to  xxxg1871xxx  (hata et al., 2003). whereas the structureactivity relationships of indomethacin derivatives as selective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase isozymes have been
extensively studied (kalgutkar et al., 2000a,b), little is
known about these molecules as  xxxg1871xxx  ligands. based on
our initial observations, we hypothesized that the arylacetic
acid core provides a fundamental structural motif that allows
this class of nsaids to bind and activate the  xxxg1871xxx  receptor. to define the structural features required for the novel
 xxxg1871xxx  activity of arylacetic acid nsaids, we performed
structure-activity relationship analysis on a series of arylacetic acid nsaids and indomethacin derivatives as mcrth2
agonists.

dynamics simulations to connect appropriate loop segments with a
trans peptide bond. a putative disulfide cross-link between the extracellular region of transmembrane helix iii and extracellular loop
2 was generated by applying additional constraints during the generation of extracellular loop 2. to simplify model construction, the
c-terminal tail was truncated at val321. the intact mcrth2 receptor model was then refined further with limited energy minimization
and low-temperature molecular dynamics simulation to relieve any
peptide backbone conformational strain or residual bad steric interactions. indomethacin was then docked into the putative ligandbinding pocket using an automated ligand docking algorithm. all
structural refinement calculations were performed in vacuo with a
distance-dependent dielectric model, using standard amber allatom potential functions. energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the amber package. ligand docking was performed using the automated docking module in
moe (chemical computing, inc., montreal, qc, canada).
data analysis. all data are presented as the mean ⫾ s.e.m.
competition binding curves and ic50 values were calculated using a
one-site competition model (prism 4; graphpad software inc., san
diego, ca). ki values were calculated according to the method of
cheng and prusoff (1973). ec50 values for [camp]i dose-response
experiments were calculated using a fixed slope sigmoidal doseresponse model (prism). differences between means were tested for
statistical significance using two-tailed unpaired t test for [camp]i
and chemotaxis experiments, with p ⬍ 0.05 considered significant
(instat 3; graphpad).

cells (100,000) were added to the upper chamber of 24-well 8.0-␮m
polycarbonate transwell inserts (costar, cambridge, ma) that had
been previously treated overnight with 5 ␮g/ml matrigel (bd biosciences, bedford, ma) in pbs at 4°c and blocked in the presence of
2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in pbs for 1 h at 37°c. ligands were
diluted in dmem and added to the lower chamber. after incubating
for 4 h at 37°c, inserts were removed and cells adhering to the top of
the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. cells on the bottom
of the membrane were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, washed
twice with pbs, and stained overnight with crystal violet. for each
insert, five independent fields were counted in blinded manner at
200⫻ magnification.
cyclooxygenase activity assay. time-dependent inhibition of
ovine  xxxg1883xxx  and murine  xxxg1884xxx  was measured
as described previously (kalgutkar et al., 2000b).
molecular modeling of mcrth2. the transmembrane spanning ␣-helical bundle of mcrth2 was constructed with homology
modeling methods, using a current ␤2-adrenergic receptor model as
a template (furse and lybrand, 2003). amino acid side chains in the
␤2-adrenergic receptor model were replaced to generate the
mcrth2 sequence, using a backbone-dependent side chain rotamer
library. limited energy minimization was used to relieve unfavorable steric interactions after side chain replacement. the extracellular and cytosolic loops were generated de novo. the amino and
carboxy terminal segments of each loop were constructed as extended peptides and attached to the end of the appropriate transmembrane helix. weak harmonic constraints were then applied
gradually during short (10–20 ps), low-temperature (30 k) molecular

iaa core of indomethacin and other arylacetic acid nsaids
is not in itself sufficient to confer binding to mcrth2.
in vivo, indomethacin undergoes demethylation of the 5⬘o-desmethyl substituent to yield 5⬘-dmi, which has been
reported to lack anti-inflammatory properties (shen, 1964;
van dyke et al., 1982). in contrast, 5⬘-dmi exhibited comparable mcrth2 binding affinity (ki ⫽ 3.9 ⫾ 1.2 ␮m) to indomethacin (fig. 3b). removal of the 2-methyl substituent
(2- xxxd2352xxx ; 2-dmi) resulted in a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity (ki ⫽ 15 ⫾ 4 ␮m). thus, the
2-methyl but not the 5⬘-o-methyl substituent contributes to
the  xxxg1871xxx  binding affinity of indomethacin. in addition,
indomethacin possesses a p-substituted n-acyl moiety, a
structural feature that is present in  xxxd3260xxx  and
 xxxd3563xxx . comparison of the binding affinities for 2-dmi
and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-hiaa), which differ principally in the absence or presence of the n-acyl moiety,
strongly suggests that this substituent is essential for highaffinity binding to mcrth2. the p-bromobenzyl indomethacin derivative (pbi) also bound to mcrth2 with similar
affinity as indomethacin (ki ⫽ 1.2 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m).
to investigate the role that the carboxylate group plays in
indomethacin- xxxg1871xxx  interaction, we assessed the ability of
the primary amide and methyl ester derivatives of indomethacin to bind to mcrth2. neither the methyl ester nor primary amide derivative showed significant binding to
mcrth2 at concentrations up to 30 ␮m (fig. 3c), indicating
that the carboxyl moiety is critical for binding.
ramatroban was recently reported to be a  xxxg1871xxx  antagonist (sugimoto et al., 2003) and shares structural similarity
with arylacetic acid nsaids (fig. 2). ramatroban displaced
[3h] xxxg1073xxx  binding with high affinity in our binding assays (ki
⫽ 28 ⫾ 6 nm; data not shown), which is in good agreement
with the reported ki values of 47 ⫾ 13 nm and 60 ⫾ 13 nm for
human and mouse  xxxg1871xxx  receptors expressed in l1.2 mouse
b cell leukemia cells (shichijo et al., 2003).
we next investigated the agonist activity of compounds
having significant binding activity at mcrth2 in [camp]i
inhibition and chemotaxis assays. indomethacin, 5⬘-dmi,
and pbi (1 ␮m) fully activated mcrth2, leading to inhibition of [camp]i generation in er293/mcrth2 cells as demonstrated by a maximal inhibitory effect equivalent to that of
the endogenous agonist  xxxg1073xxx  (fig. 4a).  xxxd3260xxx  was
also capable of achieving a maximal inhibitory effect at
higher concentrations (10 ␮m; data not shown). similar to
the rank order of relative binding affinities, 5⬘-dmi exhibited
similar potency as indomethacin (ic50 ⫽ 7 ⫾ 3 and 2.5 ⫾ 0.9
nm, respectively), whereas 2-dmi was 10-fold less potent
(ic50 ⫽ 50 ⫾ 20 nm; fig. 4b). in contrast, concentrations of
 xxxd3563xxx  up to 50 ␮m did not significantly decrease [camp]i
levels (fig. 4c) despite its similar binding affinity to indomethacin. to determine whether  xxxd3563xxx  is a mcrth2
antagonist, we evaluated whether it was capable of antagonizing indomethacin-induced inhibition of [camp]i. at high
concentrations,  xxxd3563xxx  partially antagonized the effects of
indomethacin (fig. 4d), whereas the  xxxg1871xxx  antagonist
ramatroban fully reversed the indomethacin-induced inhibition of [camp]i (ramatroban ic50 ⫽ 120 ⫾ 50 nm; data not
shown). consistent with their ability to act as mcrth2
agonists and inhibit [camp]i, indomethacin, pbi, 5⬘-dmi,
2-dmi, and  xxxd3260xxx  but not  xxxd3563xxx  (100 nm)

a panel of nsaids was screened for their ability to displace [3h] xxxg1073xxx  from the mouse  xxxg1871xxx  receptor expressed
in hek293 cells. in addition to indomethacin and  xxxd3259xxx 
(hata et al., 2003), the arylacetic acid  xxxd3260xxx  and
 xxxd3563xxx  also displaced [3h] xxxg1073xxx  binding with high affinity (ki ⫽ 1.5 ⫾ 0.1, 2.5 ⫾ 0.4, and 3.3 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m for indomethacin,  xxxd3260xxx , and  xxxd3563xxx , respectively); in contrast, diclofenac did not display detectable binding (fig. 1).
the binding of indomethacin to the human  xxxg1871xxx  receptor
(hcrth2) has been previously characterized (hirai et al.,
2002; sawyer et al., 2002); our binding assays confirmed that
the affinity of indomethacin for hcrth2 (ki ⫽ 3 ⫾ 1 ␮m;
data not shown) is similar to the affinity reported by hirai
and coworkers and similar to that of the mouse ortholog.
the arylacetic acid core of indomethacin is analogous to
 xxxd2348xxx  (iaa), a plant auxin that modulates a
number of growth processes (goldsmith, 1993). in addition to
iaa, several other biologically active molecules share an
indole or iaa core, most notably serotonin and its immediate
precursors and metabolites (fig. 2). to investigate the importance of the iaa core in conferring affinity for mcrth2,
we tested whether these molecules were capable of binding to
mcrth2. these compounds were unable to displace
[3h] xxxg1073xxx  at concentrations up to 30 ␮m (fig. 3a). thus, the

discussion
although indomethacin is predominantly known as a nonselective cox inhibitor, it has been shown to elicit a number
of cox-independent effects, including activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥, leading to adipocyte

differentiation (lehmann et al., 1997), inhibition of malignant transformation of embryonic fibroblasts (zhang et al.,
1999), and inhibition of the  xxxg1073xxx  11-ketoreductase  xxxg115xxx 
(lovering et al., 2004). it has also been demonstrated to
stimulate eosinophil shape change,  xxxg1206xxx  expression, and
chemotaxis via direct activation of the  xxxg1871xxx  receptor (hirai et al., 2002; stubbs et al., 2002). hirai and others have
reported that indomethacin, but not other nsaids such as
aspirin and ibuprofen, is an agonist at the human  xxxg1871xxx 
receptor (hirai et al., 2002; stubbs et al., 2002), and we
confirmed that the mouse  xxxg1871xxx  ortholog shares a similar
pharmacological profile (hata et al., 2003). the reported
binding affinity constants (ki) for indomethacin at the human  xxxg1871xxx  receptor vary from 25 nm (sawyer et al., 2002)
to 8 ␮m (hirai et al., 2002). the reason for this discrepancy
is unclear; however, the assay conditions used in the present
binding studies support affinities for indomethacin at both
human and mouse  xxxg1871xxx  receptors in the low micromolar
range. the ki value for  xxxd3260xxx  at hcrth2 has also
been reported (3.5 ␮m; sawyer et al., 2002) and is similar to
the value of 2.5 ␮m for mcrth2.
although the structure-activity relationships of arylacetic
acid nsaids as selective and nonselective cox inhibitors
have been characterized (kalgutkar et al., 2000b), little is
known about the structural determinants necessary for
 xxxg1871xxx  binding. no binding was observed for compounds
that included only the indole or indole-acetic acid core, suggesting that the arylacetic acid core alone is not sufficient for
binding. on the other hand, the presence of the p-substituted
n-acyl moiety seemed to correlate with mcrth2 binding
affinity. for instance, both 5⬘-dmi and 2-dmi bind to
mcrth2 with micromolar affinity, whereas 5-hiaa, which

and [camp]i levels were determined as described under
materials and methods. a, nsaids (1 ␮m) exhibit differing potencies for inhibiting [camp]i; indomethacin

indomethacin. er293/mcrth2 cells were incubated
with varying concentrations of  xxxd3563xxx  in the presence of 0.01 ␮m indomethacin. the ability of 1 ␮m
ramatroban, a known  xxxg1871xxx  antagonist, to reverse the
inhibition of [camp]i by indomethacin is shown for comparison. for a, c, and d, each data point was determined in triplicate and the mean value from 3– 8 independent experiments is shown (error bars represent
s.e.m.). for b, each data point was determined in duplicate; data are representative of three independent

stimulated migration of mcrth2-transfected er293 cells
(fig. 5).
to confirm previous reports that 5⬘-dmi lacks cox inhibitory activity (shen, 1964; van dyke et al., 1982), we tested
5⬘-dmi for its ability to directly inhibit cox-1 and -2 in vitro.
it is surprising that 5⬘-dmi showed identical inhibition of
mouse cox-2 compared with indomethacin (ic50, 250 nm for
both) and slightly lower activity in inhibiting sheep cox-1
(ic50 ⫽ 210 and 35 nm, respectively).
to visualize potential ligand-receptor interactions, we
modeled the mcrth2 receptor using a combination of de
novo and homology modeling techniques starting from the
transmembrane helical bundle of a previously described
model of the ␤2-adrenergic receptor (furse and lybrand,
2003). similar to other small-molecule binding g proteincoupled receptors, the putative ligand binding pocket is located within the top (extracellular) one-third of the transmembrane helical bundle (fig. 6a). ligand docking
simulations yielded several different low energy conformations for indomethacin within the ligand-binding pocket. it is
interesting that in one low-energy indomethacin-mcrth2
complex, the acetate carboxylate of indomethacin forms a
charge stabilized hydrogen bond with lys209 in helix v (fig.
6b), and the p-chlorobenzoyl moiety is positioned to form
hydrophobic stacking interactions with the aromatic ring of
phe110 if helix iii (fig. 6c).

interaction of nsaids with the mouse  xxxg1871xxx  receptor

differs principally in the absence of this moiety, showed no
significant binding at concentrations tested.  xxxd3563xxx ,
which lacks the indole acetic acid core but possesses the

identical n-(p-chlorobenzoyl) group to indomethacin, binds
with similar affinity to indomethacin. our molecular modeling studies suggest that this moiety could form hydrophobic
interactions with the aromatic ring of phe110 of helix iii.
beyond the apparent requirement for the p-substituted nacyl moiety, the ligand-binding pocket of mcrth2 tolerates
slight variations in substituent size at the para position as
demonstrated by the fact that  xxxd3260xxx  and pbi have
similar binding affinities. binding studies also revealed that
the 2-methyl substituent of indomethacin plays a role, albeit
less important, in mcrth2 binding. 2-dmi possesses a 10fold lower affinity for mcrth2 compared with indomethacin, and a similar relative difference was observed in ability
to inhibit fsk-stimulated [camp]i.
interactions between the negatively charged carboxylate
moiety of a ligand and positively charged residues within the
ligand binding pocket have been implicated in ligand binding
and activation of prostanoid (negishi et al., 1995; audoly and
breyer, 1997) and chemoattractant receptors (demartino et
al., 1995; mills et al., 2000). neutralization of the indomethacin carboxylate moiety by derivatization to the methyl ester
or primary amide form abolished mcrth2 binding. by comparison, neutralization of the carboxylate moiety of indomethacin decreases cox-1 but slightly increases cox-2 inhibitory activity, leading to a substantial enhancement of
cox-2 selectivity (kalgutkar et al., 2000b). although the

binding of the bacterial-derived peptide f-met-leu-phe
(fmlp) to the surface of neutrophils (cost et al., 1981). this
is especially intriguing in light of the present studies, because the  xxxg1871xxx  receptor shares significant sequence identity with the formyl peptide receptor (nagata et al., 1999a),
which is responsible for mediating the neutrophil response to
the fmlp. however, whether the effects of nsaids on these
two related receptors are caused by similarities in receptor
structure is unclear. the effect of nsaids on fmlp binding
does not seem to involve competitive binding to the fmlp
binding site within the formyl peptide receptor (minta and
williams, 1985; perianin et al., 1987), in contrast to the
hypothesized interaction between indomethacin and  xxxg1871xxx .
this study demonstrates that the  xxxg1871xxx  receptor is selective for arylacetic acid nsaids, whereas the inhibitory effect
on fmlp binding to neutrophils is also observed for nonarylacetic acid nsaids such as ibuprofen (skubitz and hammerschmidt, 1986; shelly and hoff, 1989). furthermore,
nsaid concentrations necessary to displace fmlp binding
and inhibit neutrophil function are much greater than those
required for the arylacetic acid nsaids at the  xxxg1871xxx 
receptor.
previous studies have suggested that the ability of the
 xxxg1871xxx  receptor to be activated by indomethacin is not
shared by the dp receptor (hirai et al., 2002). however,
indomethacin has been reported to bind to the human and
mouse dp receptors, albeit with an order of magnitude lower
affinity than  xxxg1871xxx  (ki ⬇ 10 ␮m; sawyer et al., 2002; hirai
et al., 2003). torisu and coworkers recently reported the
generation of novel indomethacin derivatives as antagonists
at the mouse dp receptor. modification of the n-acyl moiety
and transformation of the  xxxd2348xxx  template to
indole-4-acetic acid gave yielded substantial increases in
binding affinity and antagonistic activity (torisu et al.,
2004a). further optimization of the n-acyl moiety to
n-methyl benzomorpholine derivatives yielded potent orally
active dp receptor antagonists that inhibit ovalbumininduced vascular permeability in guinea pigs (torisu et al.,
2004b,c). binding affinities for the four ep receptor isoforms
and the  xxxg1879xxx  were also reported, but the affinity for
binding  xxxg1871xxx  was not discussed. although, the dp and
 xxxg1871xxx  receptors possess different pharmacological profiles
(hirai et al., 2001; sawyer et al., 2002), the observation that
indomethacin and indomethacin derivatives function as
 xxxg1871xxx  agonists/antagonists raises the possibility that these
novel dp antagonists may posses activity as agonists or
antagonists at  xxxg1871xxx  as well.

potential impact of subtle volume differences between the
indomethacin free acid and neutral derivatives cannot be
ignored, it is likely that the decrease in binding affinity is
caused by the loss of the negative charge and potential disruption of an interaction with a positively charged residue
side chain within the binding pocket. the primary structure
of mcrth2 reveals several positively charged residues that
may be candidates for this interaction including lys209 in
helix v, which is analogous to arg205 in the formyl peptide
receptor and arg206 in the c5a receptor, both of which have
been demonstrated to interact with ligand (demartino et al.,
1995; mills et al., 2000). our molecular modeling studies
support this possibility and suggest the presence of a chargestabilized hydrogen bond between lys209 and the indomethacin carboxylate.
in most instances, the arylacetic acid nsaids and indomethacin derivatives functioned as full mcrth2 agonists
and inhibited [camp]i and stimulated cell migration to a
similar magnitude as the endogenous ligand  xxxg1073xxx . however,
 xxxd3563xxx  failed to inhibit [camp]i even at high ligand concentrations where ⬎90% of the receptor would be expected to
be occupied by ligand (i.e., 50 ␮m). on the other hand,
 xxxd3563xxx  weakly antagonized the ability of indomethacin to
inhibit [camp]i at high concentrations, raising the possibility
that this class of molecules may be exploited for the development of  xxxg1871xxx  antagonists. ramatroban, the only  xxxg1871xxx 
antagonist reported to date, shares structural similarity with
indomethacin, including a negatively charged carboxylate
and a p-substituted acyl moiety. it is worth noting that
indomethacin and its desmethyl derivatives are capable of
activating mcrth2 at nanomolar concentrations despite
having micromolar binding affinities [ec50,(camp) and ki for
indomethacin are 2.5 nm and 1.5 ␮m, respectively], whereas
the difference between ec50 and ki for  xxxg1073xxx  is much smaller
[ec50,(camp) and ki ⫽ 0.9 and 38 nm, respectively; hata et
al., 2003]. a similar phenomenon has been reported for the
human  xxxg1871xxx  ortholog whereby indomethacin possesses
micromolar binding affinity but stimulates intracellular calcium mobilization at nanomolar concentrations and  xxxg1073xxx 
possesses nanomolar binding affinity and stimulates intracellular calcium mobilization at nanomolar concentrations
(hirai et al., 2001, 2002). the small difference between the
relative potencies of indomethacin and  xxxg1073xxx  despite the
large difference in binding affinities suggests that indomethacin may possess greater intrinsic activity, the relative ability to affect a specific conformational change in the receptor
upon binding, as a  xxxg1871xxx  agonist than  xxxg1073xxx .
in vivo, indomethacin undergoes o-demethylation to yield
5⬘-dmi, a minor metabolite that is present in plasma and
urine (duggan et al., 1972; vree et al., 1993). 5⬘-dmi has
been reported to lack anti-inflammatory activity (shen, 1964;
van dyke et al., 1982) suggesting that it has lost the ability
to inhibit cyclooxygenase. we found that 5⬘-dmi has similar
potency to indomethacin for activating mcrth2, initially
suggesting that 5⬘-dmi may be a selective arylacetic acidclass  xxxg1871xxx  ligand. however, further in vitro studies directly examining the ability of 5⬘-dmi to function as a cox
inhibitor revealed that it is comparable with indomethacin in
its ability to inhibit cox-2 and only slightly less potent for
cox-1.
