abstract

to study the influence of dopaminergic activity on the expression of dopamine d 2 receptors and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
in substantia nigra, mice were treated daily for several days with an irreversibly acting dopamine d 1 and  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist n-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-l,2-dihydroquinoline (eedq) or with a selective irreversible d 2 dopamine receptor
antagonist fluphenazine-n-mustard. mice were killed 24 h after the last injection. dopamine d 1 and dopamine d 2 receptors
were determined by receptor autoradiography, and dopamine d 1 and dopamine d 2 receptor mrna and  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase mrna were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. the results showed that treatment with eedq,
which blocked 80% to 85% of the dopamine d 2 and dopamine d 1 receptors in substantia nigra, increased the levels of dopamine
d 2 receptor mrna in substantia nigra by about 27%. treatment with fluphenazine-n-mustard, which blocked about 85% of the
d o p a m i n e o 2 receptors in substantia nigra but had no significant effect on dopamine d 1 receptors, increased the levels of
d o p a m i n e o 2 receptor mrna by about 34%. there were no detectable levels of dopamine 01 receptor mrna in substantia
nigra either in control animals or in animals treated with the dopamine receptor antagonists.  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
mrna was expressed in several regions of the mid-brain but only that expressed in substantia nigra was altered by treatment
with dopamine receptor antagonists. the levels of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase mrna in substantia nigra increased by 83%
following eedq treatment, and by 50% following treatment with fluphenazine-n-mustard. these results suggested that
dopamine receptors, particularly dopamine d 2 receptors, play an important role in regulating the expression of both dopamine
d 2 receptor mrna and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase mrna in substantia nigra.

1. introduction

neurotransmitters, though their interaction with
their respective target receptor proteins, not only elicit
acute electrophysiological and biochemical responses
in postsynaptic neurons, but also produce long-term
modulation of the expression of certain genes in their
target neurons. this is one of the important homeostatic mechanisms by which altered presynaptic input
can produce adaptive changes in electrophysiological

and biochemical responses in postsynaptic neurons.
d o p a m i n e is one of the most widely studied neurotransmitters in the central nervous system that has
been shown to regulate the expression of certain genes
in basal ganglia (vernier et al., 1988; gerfen et al.,
1990; angulo et al., 1991; qin et al., 1994a-c). the
transcripts for the genes regulated by dopaminergic
input include dopamine d a and dopamine o 2 receptor
m r n a and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a . this
may be of physiological significance since dopamine
and y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) are important neurotransmitters in basal ganglia (graybiel 1990).
two general pharmacological strategies have been
employed to study the transsynaptic regulation of gene

expression by dopaminergic transmission. one strategy
is to destroy nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways using
neurotoxins, such as 6-hydroxydopamine. another
strategy is to block or activate postsynaptic receptors
using selective dopamine receptor antagonists or agonists. studies using 6-hydroxydopamine produced relatively consistent results. they showed that removal of
dopaminergic input increased the level of dopamine d 2
receptor m r n a (gerfen et al., 1990; neve et al., 1991;
lisovoski et al., 1992; qin et al., 1994b) and decreased
the level of dopamine d 1 receptor m r n a (gerfen et
al., 1990; qin et al., 1994b) in the denervated striatum.
lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway also
increased the rate of synthesis of dopamine d 2 receptors but decreased the rate of synthesis of dopamine
o 1 receptors in the denervated striatum, results that
correlate well with the differential effects of 6-hydroxydopamine on the levels of dopamine d 1 and dopamine
d 2 receptor mrnas (neve et al., 1985; qin et al.,
1994b). lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway also induce an increase in the level of glutamic
acid decarboxylase m r n a in the denervated striatum
(vernier et al., 1988; lindefors et al., 1989; segovia et
al., 1990; soghomonian et al., 1992) and in the globus
pallidus ipsilateral to lesions (kincaid et al., 1992).
these effects of 6-hydroxydopamine lesions on dopamine receptors and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a
could be reversed by chronically treating animals with
dopamine receptor agonists or by implanting dopaminergic grafts (segovia et al., 1991; savasta et al., 1992).
as a corollary to the experiments in which dopaminergic input was reduced, chronic treatment with
dopamine d 2 receptor agonists decreased the levels of
dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a (chen et al., 1993) and
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a (caboche et al.,
1991). these studies suggested that dopamine plays a
role in modulating the expression of dopamine receptors and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase.
in contrast to the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine,
studies using dopamine receptor antagonists produced
inconsistent changes on dopamine d1 and dopamine
d 2 receptor mrna. treatment with dopamine d 2
receptor antagonists either increased (srivastava et al.,
1990; bernard et al., 1991; de la concha et al., 1991;
buckland et al., 1992; kopp et al., 1992) or did not
change (van tol et al., 1990; goss et al., 1991; matsunaga et al., 1991; creese et al., 1992) the level of
dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a in striatum. similarly,
blocking dopamine d l receptors produced both increases (creese et al., 1992) or decreases (chen et al.,
unpublished) the levels of dopamine d~ receptor
mrna. however, chronic treatment with dopamine
receptor antagonists such as sulpiride, haloperidol and
clozapine consistently increased the level of glutamic
acid decarboxylase m r n a in striatum, globus pallidus
and entopeduncular nucleus (caboche et al., 1992;

mercugliano et al., 1992; chen and weiss, 1993; qin et
al., 1994a).
thus far, no study has focused on the effects of
dopaminergic input on the regulation of dopamine d?
receptor m r n a in substantia nigra. this area of the
brain sends major efferents to the striatum and receives major afferents from several regions of the basal
ganglia (albin et al., 1989). there are two major populations of nigral neurons: dopaminergic neurons and
gabaergic neurons. dopaminergic neurons are found
mainly in the substantia nigra, pars compacta, whereas
gabaergic neurons are localized largely to the substantia nigra, pars reticulata. the dopaminergic neurons in pars compacta project to the striatum whereas
the gabaergic neurons in pars reticulata project to
the thalamic nucleus and the superior colliculus.
therefore, the substantia nigra plays an important role
in regulating the function of basal ganglia and motor
activity (albin et al., 1989; chevalier and deniau,
1990).
the substantia nigra expresses high levels of dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a which encodes the dopamine
autoreceptor. there autoreceptors play a prominent
role in regulating the synthesis and release of dopamine
(ch6ramy et al., 1981; altar et al., 1987; johnson et al.,
1992) as well as the rate of firing of dopaminergic
neurons (aghajanian and bunney, 1977). the substantia nigra also expresses high levels of  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase mrna, and gabaergic output from
substantia nigra plays an important role in regulating
movement (parent, 1990). however, the effects of
dopaminergic input on  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
mrna in this brain area has not yet been reported.
in the present studies, the effects of persistent
blockade of dopamine receptors with two irreversible
antagonists, n-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy- 1,2-dihydroquinoline ( e e d q ) and fluphenazine-n-mustard, on the
levels of dopamine d 2 receptor mrna and glutamic
acid decarboxylase mrna in substantia nigra were
examined. the results showed that blockade of dopamine receptors, particularly dopamine d 2 receptors,
significantly increased the levels of dopamine d 2 r e c e p t o r m r n a and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase mrna
in substantia nigra.

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals

male swiss webster mice, weighing 22-24, g were
purchased from ace animals inc. (boyertown, pa).
animals were housed in a temperature and humiditycontrolled environment with a 12 h light-dark circle.
all animals had free access to food and water.

z.-h. qin, b. weiss/european journal of pharmacology - molecular pharmacology section 269 (1994) 25-33
2.2. drugs and probes

e e d q was purchased from aldrich chemical co.
(milwaukee, wi). fluphenazine-n-mustard was purchased from rbi (natic, ma). a 39 mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe was designed to detect both the long
and short forms of d 2 dopamine receptor mrnas
(chen et al., 1991), based on the c d n a sequence
published by bunzow et al. (1988). a 36 mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe was designed to detect the
mouse  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a that encodes the 62 kda  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase protein
(katarova et al., 1990; qin et al., 1994a). the structure
of this probe was based on the cdna sequence published by katarova et al. (1990).
2.3. administration of drugs

e e d q and fluphenazine-n-mustard were dissolved
in  xxxd102xxx , and then were diluted with 0.9%
 xxxg2020xxx  (ethanol/saline = 1:2). mice were treated once
daily with e e d q or fluphenazine-n-mustard for 5
days. control animals received the vehicle solution. all
animals were killed 24 h after the last injection. the
animals were orally administered concentrated milk to
minimize weight lose caused by e e d q treatment.
2.4. receptor autoradiography

mice were decapitated, and brains were dissected
and stored at -80Â°c. coronal sections (12 /xm) were
cut on a cryostat at the level of f - 2 . 8 to - 3 . 0 ,
according to slotnick and leonard (1975), and were
mounted onto gelatin-coated microscope slides. receptor autoradiography was performed according to procedures described previously (qin et al., 1994b). briefly,
brain sections were washed and incubated in 50 mm
tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.4) at room temperature for 60
min. for labeling dopamine d 1 receptors, brain sections were incubated in tris-hc1 buffer with 2 nm
[3h]sch-23390. non-specific binding was determined
by incubating anatomically adjacent sections in the
presence of 2 /zm sch-23390. for labeling dopamine
d 2 receptors, brain sections were incubated in tris-hc1
buffer with 2 nm [3h]raclopride. non-specific binding
was determined by incubating anatomically adjacent
sections in the presence of 2 /xm sulpiride. after
incubation with radioactive ligands, brain sections were
rinsed, dried and exposed to x-ray film (hyperfilm[3h], amersham) for 10 days (for dopamine d 1 receptors) or 60 days (for dopamine d 2 receptors). the film
autoradiographs were quantitatively analyzed using a
computerized image analyzer (dumas, drexel university). tritium standards (american radioactive
chemicals, inc.) were used to construct a standard
curve from which the amount of ligand bound to tissue

27

was derived from the gray levels of signals; these values
were then converted to f m o l / m g tissue based on the
specific activity of the ligand. three adjacent brain
sections were used for each measurement.
2.5. in situ hybridization histochemistry

synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes were labeled
with [35s]- xxxd1148xxx  (1500 c i / m m o l , nen, boston) using
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (ibi, new haven)
and were purified with n e n s o r b 20 nucleic acid
purification cartridges (nen, boston). in situ hybridization histochemistry was performed as described
earlier (chen et al., 1991). briefly, brain sections were
fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (0.1 m pbs, ph 7.0), then were rinsed,
dehydrated and hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (1.5 Ã 106 cpm/section). after hybridization, brain sections were washed, dehydrated,
dried and exposed to x-ray film (hyperfilm /3 max,
amersham) for 10-14 days. the film autoradiographs
were quantitatively analyzed using a dumas image
analyzer. optical density standards (kodak autoradiographic standard tablet no 3) were used for constructing a standard curve from which optical density values
were derived from gray levels of signals after subtracting the film background. three adjacent sections were
used for each measurement.
2.6. statistical analyses

all data were analyzed using one-way a n o v a followed by a dunnett t-test.

3.1. effects o f e e d q and fluphenazine-n-mustard on
dopamine d 1 and dopamine d 2 receptors in mouse
substantia nigra

fig. 1a shows the effects of repeated treatment with
e e d q and fluphenazine-n-mustard on dopamine d 1
receptors in the mouse substantia nigra, as determined
by receptor autoradiography. as may be seen, the
substantia nigra, pars reticulata expressed high levels
of dopamine d 1 receptors (control). the density of
dopamine d 1 receptors in this brain area showed a
distinct decreasing ventromedial to dorsolateral gradient. there was also a significant signal in the cerebral
cortex. although sch-23390 binds primarily to
dopamine d 1 receptors, it also binds to serotonin 5-ht 2
receptors, albeit with a relatively low binding affinity
(hess et al., 1986). previous studies from our laboratory showed that under the experimental conditions
used, there was no substantial binding of sch-23390 to

this was apparent in both the substantia nigra and

had no obvious effects on dopamine d~ receptors in
mouse substantia nigra or cerebral cortex (fig. 1a). a

or fluphenazine-n-mustard (50%) (fig. 4b). moreover,
e e d q was significantly more effective than fluphenazine-n-mustard in inducing increases in  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase m r n a in mouse substantia nigra ( p <

or fluphenazine-n-mustard on  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a in any of the other brain regions indicated above (data not shown).

the means by which the nervous system compensates for altered neuronal input is an important problem in neurobiology. in many cases this compensation
is achieved by modulation of specific receptors that
interact with their respective neurotransmitters. recently, the mechanism by which dopamine receptors
are regulated has been partially uncovered, for there is
now evidence with that the transcripts encoding for
these receptors are altered.
several laboratories reported on the effects of
dopaminergic input on the levels of dopamine d] and
dopamine d 2 receptor mrna. continuous treatment
with the dopamine d 2 / d 3 agonist quinpirole resulted
in a decreased density of dopamine d 2 receptors (zhou
et al., 1991) and a decreased level of dopamine d 2
receptor m r n a (chen et al., 1993). however, the
effects of dopamine antagonists on the levels of dopamine d l and dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a in striaturn have not been consistent. differences in dosage,
frequency of drug administration, length of treatment,
and species may be partially responsible for these
inconsistent results. indeed, it is well established that
intermittent administration of dopaminergic drugs has
effects on dopamine receptors different from those
produced by their continuous administration (engber
et al., 1993). therefore, the present studies examined
the effects of irreversible dopamine receptor antagonists on the levels of the dopamine receptor transcripts. the major advantage of using irreversible dopamine antagonists are that the magnitude of blockade
of dopamine d 1 and dopamine d 2 receptors is greater
than that can be achieved by reversible dopamine
receptor antagonists and that the blockade of dopamine
receptors is well maintained between intervals of drug
administration.
repeated administration of eedq, which produced
about 85% inhibition of dopamine d~ and 80% inhibition of dopamine d2, induced a significant increase in
the levels of dopamine d 2 receptor mrna in mouse
substantia nigra, pars compacta. e e d q is a relatively
non-selective, irreversible dopamine receptor antagonist, interacting not only with both dopamine d l and
dopamine d 2 receptors, but with other neurotransmitter receptors as well (miller et al., 1991). for this
reason, we included in this study a more selective
irreversible dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist fluphenazine-n-mustard. fluphenazine-n-mustard selectively
blocks dopamine d 2 receptors with little or no effects
on dopamine d 1 receptors (thermos et al., 1987; winkler et al., 1987). the present results showed that
fluphenazine-n-mustard was as effective as e e d q in
blocking dopamine d 2 receptors in mouse substantia
nigra, but had no significant effects on dopamine d 1
receptors. like eedq, fluphenazine-n-mustard in-

duced a significant increase in the levels of dopamine
d 2 receptor m r n a in mouse substantia nigra, pars
compacta.
the substantia nigra consists of the pars reticulata
and pars compacta. the pars reticulata contains
dopamine d 1 receptors but little or no dopamine d 1
receptor m r n a and little or no dopamine d 2 receptors or dopamine d 2 receptor mrna, suggesting that
dopamine d 1 receptors in pars reticulata are in nerve
terminals whose cell bodies lie outside this area (altar
and hauser 1987). by contrast, the pars compacta
contains abundant levels of dopamine d 2 receptors
and dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a but relatively few
dopamine d 1 receptors or dopamine d 1 receptor rna.
the dopamine d 2 receptors in pars compacta are
thought to be dopamine autoreceptors which are located at dopaminergic nerve terminals as well as at
somatodendritic sites of dopaminergic neurons. these
autoreceptors play important roles in regulating the
synthesis and release of dopamine and the firing rate
of nigral dopaminergic neurons (altar et al., 1987;
ch6ramy et al., 1981). although the activity of dopamine autoreceptors can be altered by chronic treatment with dopamine agonists and antagonists (gordon
et al., 1986), it is difficult to determine whether these
treatments alter the levels of dopamine autoreceptors,
as there are no selective ligands for dopamine autoreceptors. one means of addressing this issue is to study
the effects of dopamine agonists and antagonists on
the dopamine receptor transcripts. for since the
dopamine receptor transcripts are likely to be only in
cell bodies, by measuring the dopamine d 2 receptor
m r n a in substantia nigra, pars compacta by in situ
hybridization histochemistry, one may be able to measure the levels of the m r n a encoding dopamine autoreceptors and thereby gain insights into how dopamine autoreceptors are regulated. this may be a useful
alternative for studying the regulation of dopamine
autoreceptors and its implication in certain neurological disorders.
although fluphenazine-n-mustard or e e d q failed
to significantly alter the levels of either dopamine d 1
or dopamine d 2 receptor mrnas in mouse striatum,
nucleus accumbens or olfactory tubercle (qin et al.,
1994b), these treatments significantly increased the levels of dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a in mouse substantia nigra, pars compacta. this suggests the possibility
that blockade of dopamine autoreceptors increases the
expression of dopamine d 2 receptor m r n a in substantia nigra, pars compacta, leading to an increased
synthesis and density of dopamine autoreceptors.
the major efferents from the substantia nigra, pars
reticulata are gabaergic. these gabaergic neurons
project to the thalamic nucleus and superior colliculus
(chevalier and deniau, 1990; parent 1990) and play an
important role in regulating motor activity (albin et al.,

31

1989). in the present studies, we found that persistent
blockade of dopamine d~ and dopamine d 2 receptors
by e e d q or blockade of dopamine d 2 receptors by
fluphenazine-n-mustard significantly increased the levels of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a in substantia
nigra pars reticulata. treatment with either e e d q or
fluphenazine-n-mustard failed to alter the levels of
g a d m r n a in other brain areas such as superior
colliculus, darkschewitch nucleus, dentate gyrus, red
nucleus and interpenduncular nucleus, an effect which
may be explained by the fact that these latter brain
areas express relatively low levels of dopamine receptors.
previous studies showed that e e d q and fluphenazine-n-mustard were almost equally effective in increasing  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a in mouse
striatum, both drugs increasing the levels of glutamic
acid decarboxylase m r n a by less than 30% (qin et al.,
1994a). the present studies, showed that similar treatment with these antagonists increased the levels of
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a more dramatically
in substantia nigra, pars reticulata than in striatum
(50% increase induced by fluphenazine-n-mustard and
83% increase induced by eedq). since e e d q interacts with g a b a receptors as well as with dopamine
receptors (miller et al., 1991), it is possible that inhibition of g a b a receptors may account for some of the
effects of e e d q on  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
m r n a in substantia nigra, pars reticulata. the data
showing that fluphenazine-n-mustard also increases
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a and that this increase in  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a is evident
in substantia nigra, pars reticulata supports the contention that dopamine receptors, particularly dopamine d 2 receptors, modulate the expression of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a in substantia nigra,
pars reticulata. however, it is still possible that e e d q
and fluphenazine-n-mustard may interact with other
dopamine receptor subtypes and that these interactions may account for some of the effects observed.
in s u m m a r y , the present studies demonstrate that
persistent blockade of dopamine d 2 receptors increases the levels of dopamine o 2 receptor m r n a in
substantia nigra, pars compacta, and increases the levels of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase m r n a in substantia
nigra, pars reticulata. the increased levels of these
transcripts in these brain areas may contribute to the
alterations of motor activity induced by long-term use
of dopamine receptor antagonists.
