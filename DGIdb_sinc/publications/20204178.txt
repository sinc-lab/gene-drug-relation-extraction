 xxxg2412xxx  agonists (vdras) directly suppress  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) mrna expression. diﬀerent vdras are
known to have diﬀerential eﬀects on serum calcium (ca), which may also aﬀect serum pth levels since serum ca regulates pth
secretion mediated by the ca-sensing receptor ( xxxg343xxx ). in this study, we compared the eﬀects of  xxxd2851xxx  and  xxxd1935xxx  on
regulating serum ca and pth, and also the expression of pth, vdr, and  xxxg343xxx  mrna. the 5/6 nephrectomized (nx) spraguedawley rats on a normal or hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet were treated with vehicle,  xxxd2851xxx , or  xxxd1935xxx  for two
weeks. both drugs at the tested doses (0.042–0.33 mug/kg) suppressed pth mrna expression and serum pth eﬀectively in the 5/6
nx rats, but  xxxd2851xxx  was less potent in raising serum ca than  xxxd1935xxx . in pig parathyroid cells,  xxxd2851xxx  and the active
form of  xxxd1935xxx  induced vdr translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, suppressed pth mrna expression and
inhibited cell proliferation in a similar manner, although  xxxd2851xxx  induced the expression of  xxxg343xxx  mrna more eﬀectively. the
multiple eﬀects of vdras on modulating serum ca, parathyroid cell proliferation, and the expression of  xxxg343xxx  and pth mrna
reflect the complex involvement of the vitamin d axis in regulating the mineral homeostasis system.

1. introduction
the steroid hormone, 1, 25- xxxd408xxx  (1,
25(oh)2 d3 , calcitriol), activates multiple signaling
pathways in various cells and tissues. although the
synthesis of  xxxd1682xxx  occurs naturally in the skin with
adequate sunlight exposure,  xxxd1682xxx  is not active and
needs to be converted to 25(oh)d3 in the liver. from
the liver, 25(oh)d3 is transported to the kidney and
hydroxylated by  xxxg581xxx  to
form the active hormone, 1, 25- xxxd408xxx  or
calcitriol [1]. calcitriol is metabolized by 25-hydroxyvitamin
d-24-hydroxylase (cyp24a1) [2] to yield the biliary
excretory product calcitroic acid. the binding of 1, 25dihydroxyvitamin d3 or its analogs to the vitamin d
receptor (vdr), a nuclear receptor, activates vdr to recruit
cofactors to form the vdr/cofactor complex, which binds

to vitamin d response elements in the promoter region of
target genes to regulate gene transcription [3].
during the past three decades, a majority of the studies
in the vdr field have focused on elucidating its role in
mineral homeostasis, which covers regulation of parathyroid
hormone, intestinal calcium, and phosphate absorption
and bone metabolism [4]. as a result of those studies,
many new vdr agonists or activators (vdras) have been
developed in an eﬀort to curtail the increases in serum
ca associated with calcitriol. currently new vdras such
as  xxxd2851xxx  and  xxxd1935xxx  are commonly used to
manage hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic kidney
disease (ckd) [1].  xxxd2851xxx , like calcitriol, activates
vdr directly, while  xxxd1935xxx  is inactive until it is
metabolized in the liver to form 1, 25(oh)2 d2 (the major
active metabolite) and 1, 24(oh)2 d2 (the minor active
metabolite).

the serum pth level is maintained by various mechanisms. decreases in serum calcium (ca) (hypocalcemia)
and prolonged increases in serum phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) stimulate the parathyroid gland to secrete pth
from its storage granules. ca regulates pth secretion from
the storage mediated by the ca-sensing receptor ( xxxg343xxx ),
while vdras down-regulate pth gene expression at the
transcriptional level. however, diﬀerent vdras also exert
diﬀerential eﬀects on raising serum ca, which may aﬀect
serum pth levels. in an eﬀort to investigate how the vitamin
d axis modulates diﬀerent factors involved in the mineral
homeostasis system, we compared two vdras,  xxxd2851xxx 
and  xxxd1935xxx , on modulating serum ca and pth,
and the expression of vdr, pth and  xxxg343xxx  mrna in
5/6 nephrectomized rats and in primary culture of pig
parathyroid cells. we also studied the eﬀect of vdras
on parathyroid cell proliferation and employed confocal
microscopy to examine the vdr subcellular distribution
pattern after parathyroid cells were treated with  xxxd2851xxx 
or active  xxxd1935xxx . our results suggest that  xxxd2851xxx 
and  xxxd1935xxx  regulate multiple factors involved in the
mineral homeostasis system in a similar manner with some
subtle diﬀerences.

2. methods
2.1. materials.  xxxd1935xxx  (1alpha(oh)d2 ,  xxxd1935xxx ), the major active metabolite of  xxxd1935xxx  (1alpha,
25-dihydroxyvitamin d2 , 1, 25(oh)2 d2 ), and 19-nor-1alpha, 25dihydroxyvitamin d2 (19-nor-1alpha, 25-(oh)2 d2 ,  xxxd2851xxx )
were from abbott laboratories. other reagents were of
analytical grade.
2.2. subtotally nephrectomized rats. the 5/6 nephrectomized (nx) uremic rats were obtained from charles
river. the nephrectomy was performed on male, spraguedawley rats with a standard two-step surgical ablation
procedure. about six weeks after the surgery, the rats were
treated with vehicle (5% ethanol +95%  xxxd3034xxx ,
0.4 ml/kg),  xxxd2851xxx  or  xxxd1935xxx  at the indicated
doses intraperitoneally (i.p.), 3 times/week, for two weeks.
twenty-four hours after the last dosing, animals were anesthetized with ketamine and blood samples were collected.
in the study measuring pth mrna in the parathyroid
gland, about two weeks after the surgery the rats were
put on a hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet containing 0.9%
phosphorous and 0.6% calcium for 4 weeks, followed by
treatment with vehicle,  xxxd2851xxx  or  xxxd1935xxx  at the
indicated dose (i.p., 3 times/week) for two weeks. twentyfour hours after the last dosing, animals were anesthetized
with ketamine and blood and parathyroid gland were
collected.
2.3. measurements of physiological parameters. serum total
calcium (ca), serum phosphorus (pi), creatinine, and bun
concentrations were measured using an abbott aeroset.
serum pth was measured using a rat intact  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) elisa kit obtained from alpco (windham,

international journal of endocrinology
nh). blood ica was determined using an i-stat portable
clinical analyzer with an eg 7+ cartridge.
2.4. real-time rt-pcr. real-time reverse transcriptionpcr was performed with a icycler (biorad, hercules, ca).
each sample has a final volume of 25 mul containing 100 ng of
cdna, 0.4 mum each of the forward and reverse pcr primers
and 0.1 mum of the taqman probe (applied biosystems).
temperature conditions consisted of a step of 5 minutes at
95◦ c, followed by 40 cycles of 60◦ c for 1 minute and 95◦ c for
15 seconds. data was collected during each extension phase
of the pcr reaction and analyzed with the software package
(biorad). threshold cycles were determined for each gene.
2.5. pig parathyroid cell cultures. freshly harvested pig
parathyroid glands were purchased from analytical biological systems (wilmington, de). dispersed pig parathyroid cells were prepared using a method adapted from
those previously described for isolating bovine parathyroid
cells [5, 6]. briefly, pig parathyroid glands were rinsed in
100% ethanol first and then in ice-cold buﬀer a (20 mm
hepes, ph 7.5, in dmem without bicarbonate, plus 1 mm
ca, 1 mm magnesium, 500 units/ml penicillin, 500 mug/ml
streptomycin, 1.25 mug/ml  xxxd164xxx , and 100 mug/ml
 xxxd2193xxx ). the glands were trimmed of extraneous fatty
tissue and finely minced into fragments. the minced pieces
were washed twice with ice-cold pbs and incubated in buﬀer
a containing 2 mg/ml collagenase type 1 (worthington
no. 4196) and 50 mug/ml dnase 1 (sigma no. dn25,
10 ml/gram of tissue) for 1.5–3.0 hours at 37◦ c in a co2
incubator. during incubation the tissue was stirred every
30 minutes. at the end of the digestion period large pieces
were removed and the cell suspension was filtered through
70 mum and then 40 mum cell strainers (bd, falcon). the cells
were washed 3x with ice-cold pbs and gently resuspended
in medium a containing dmem: ham’s f-12 (50 : 50),
10% fbs, 1.2 mm ca, 15 mm hepes, 100 iu/ml penicillin,
100 mug/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mug/ml  xxxd164xxx , 1 : 100
insulin-tranferrin-selenium (gibco). the cells were then
incubated overnight at 37◦ c in a co2 incubator, and washed
for at least 3 times in medium a. a > 80% viability (as
determined by trypan blue staining) was obtained. cells were
used within 2 days for experiments.
2.6. proliferation assay. pig parathyroid cells were plated at 1
× 107 cells/well into 48-well plates (corning, corning, ny).

the cell number was determined at plating (day 0) and after
cells were treated with test agents for 72 hours.
2.7. confocal microscopy. cells grown in four-chamber slides
were treated with test agent for diﬀerent periods of time.
cells were washed with pbs for 30 seconds, fixed with
4% formaldehyde in pbs for 15 minutes, washed again
with pbs, and then treated with 0.2% triton x-100 in
pbs for 5 minutes. the slides were rinsed with pbs and
incubated with pbs plus 1% bsa for 1 hour at room
temperature. the slides were then incubated with a mouse
anti-vdr monoclonal antibody (50-fold dilution, santa

figure 4: eﬀects of  xxxd2851xxx  and  xxxd1935xxx  on serum pth and pth mrna levels in uremic rats. the 5/6 nx rats on a
hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet were treated with vehicle,  xxxd2851xxx , or  xxxd1935xxx  at 0.33 mug/kg, i.p., 3 times/week, for two weeks
(n = 8–11 per group). blood samples and parathyroid gland were collected for the measurement of serum pth (a) and pth mrna (b).
for (b), real-time rt-pcr was performed as described in materials and methods. the mrna expression level was first normalized to
the  xxxg861xxx  mrna level and then calculated as % of control (sham-vehicle, 100%). one way anova dunnett test with 95% confidence

significantly changed in the 5/6 nx-vehicle group (versus
sham).  xxxd2851xxx  and  xxxd1935xxx  induced an increase
in serum and ionized ca in a dose-dependent manner; the
eﬀect of  xxxd1935xxx  was much more profound than that
of  xxxd2851xxx . although there was variation in the serum
phosphate (pi) values (figure 3(c)), both drugs at the tested
doses did not have a significant eﬀect. these results are
consistent with a previous report by slatopolsky et al. [7]
that  xxxd2851xxx  is less hypercalcemic than  xxxd1935xxx .
figure 3(d) shows that serum pth was elevated in the 5/6
nx rat, and was significantly reduced by either  xxxd2851xxx 
or  xxxd1935xxx  at the tested doses.
we then determined the eﬀects of these two drugs on
pth mrna expression in the 5/6 nx rats. in order to induce
parathyroid gland hypertrophy so that enough tissues could
be collected for real-time pcr analysis, the 5/6 nx rats were
put on a hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet containing 0.9%
phosphorous and 0.6% calcium [8] for 4 weeks, followed
by treatment with vehicle or drugs for two weeks. table 1
summarizes the physiological parameters. similar to the
study in figures 2 and 3, the serum creatinine and bun
levels were significantly elevated in the 5/6 nx rats (versus
sham).  xxxd2851xxx  at or  xxxd1935xxx  at 0.33 mug/kg had no
significant eﬀect on creatinine or bun. the serum ca or
ica level was lower in the nx-vehicle group, while serum pi
was significantly higher. both drugs at the tested dose raised
serum ca and ica, but did not significantly change the serum
phosphate level (versus nx-vehicle). the caxpi product was
increased by the drug treatment, although the value in the
 xxxd2851xxx  group failed to reach a statistical significance
(versus nx-vehicle). figure 4 shows that the combination of
5/6 nephrectomy and the hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet
caused a 17-fold increase in the serum pth level and a 4.6-

fold increase in pth mrna (versus sham). both  xxxd2851xxx 
and  xxxd1935xxx  at the tested dose reduced serum pth
and pth mrna.
to further investigate the eﬀects of  xxxd2851xxx  and
 xxxd1935xxx  on pth mrna expression, we treated primary culture of pig parathyroid cells with diﬀerent concentrations of  xxxd2851xxx  or the major active metabolite
of  xxxd1935xxx  (1alpha, 25-(oh)2 d2 , active  xxxd1935xxx ).
figure 5(a) shows the results from real-time rt-pcr analysis
that  xxxd2851xxx  decreased pth mrna eﬀectively in a
dose-dependent manner achieving a 75% inhibition at
100 nm. active  xxxd1935xxx  also suppressed pth mrna
in a similar manner. figure 5(b) shows that  xxxd2851xxx  or
active  xxxd1935xxx  did not have a significant eﬀect on
vdr mrna expression. figure 5(c) shows that  xxxd2851xxx 
induced the expression of  xxxg343xxx  mrna in a dose-dependent
manner, while active  xxxd1935xxx  had no eﬀect.
figure 6 compares the eﬀects of  xxxd2851xxx  and active
 xxxd1935xxx  on the proliferation of the pig parathyroid
cells. during the 72 hours incubation period, the number of
parathyroid cells increased by ∼3-fold (versus day 0). both
drugs inhibited the proliferation of these cells.
we then treated the parathyroid cells with 1 nm  xxxd2851xxx  or active  xxxd1935xxx  for 30 minutes or 48 hours,
and then fixed and stained cells with an anti-vdr antibody
to examine the eﬀect of these two drugs on the subcellular
localization of vdr. the nuclei were stained by  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide (red color). figure 7 shows representative fields from
confocal microscopy. the pig parathyroid cells contained
a thin layer of cytoplasm over a large nucleus. in the
absence of vdras, vdr staining (green color) seemed more
dispersed in the cytoplasm in ∼90% of cells; approximately
10% of cells exhibited strong vdr staining in the nuclei

for 30 minutes, an increase in vdr localization in the
nucleus was observed in >80% of cells; the eﬀects of both
drugs were similar. interestingly, in cells treated with 1 nm
 xxxd2851xxx  continuously for 48 hours, vdr localization
was still observed in the nucleus in >60% of the cells. as
a comparison, >80% of the cells treated with 1 nm active
 xxxd1935xxx  for 48 hours exhibited no vdr staining, and
the remaining vdr-positive cells exhibited a bright ring of
green color (vdr staining) surrounding the nucleus.

figure 5: eﬀect of  xxxd2851xxx  and active  xxxd1935xxx  on the
expression of pth, vdr, and  xxxg343xxx  mrna in pig parathyroid
cells. cells were treated with  xxxd2851xxx  and active  xxxd1935xxx 
at indicated concentrations (in log m) for 24 hours. samples were
processed and real-time rt-pcr performed. the mrna expression
level was normalized to the  xxxg861xxx  mrna level. c: control (no
drug treatment); doxer:  xxxd1935xxx . values shown are mean ±
the standard deviation (n = 4). one way anova dunnett test with
95% confidence intervals of diﬀerence was performed for statistical
comparisons. ∗ p < .05, ∗∗ p < .01, ∗∗∗ p < .001 versus control (c,

vdras regulate pth at the transcriptional level. however,
the serum pth level is maintained by other mechanisms
including serum ca and phosphate, which modulates the
parathyroid gland to secrete pth from its storage granules.
it is known that diﬀerent vdras such as calcitriol,  xxxd1935xxx , and  xxxd2851xxx  exhibit diﬀerent eﬀects on raising
serum ca. calcitriol is about 10-fold more hypercalcemic
than  xxxd2851xxx , while  xxxd1935xxx  is ∼2-3-fold more
hypercalcemic [2, 9–11]. to investigate whether the diﬀerent
hypercalcemic eﬀect of vdras plays a role in serum
pth suppression, we studied  xxxd2851xxx  and  xxxd1935xxx 
because these two drugs are similar in potency in suppressing
serum pth with diﬀerent hypercalcemic eﬀects. our data
from the 5/6 nx rats are consistent with the previous studies
[9–11] that  xxxd2851xxx  and  xxxd1935xxx  are equally
eﬃcacious in suppressing serum pth, but  xxxd2851xxx  is less
hypercalcemic than  xxxd1935xxx .

figure 7: localization of vdr in pig parathyroid cells. cells were incubated without (a) or with 1 nm  xxxd2851xxx  (b) or active  xxxd1935xxx 
(c) for 30 minutes or 48 hours, and then stained for vdr (green) and nucleus (red). the vdr staining alone was also shown in black and
white. (a): 3× magnification; (b) and (c): 2× magnification; doxer:  xxxd1935xxx .

since it is not practical to isolate parathyroid cells from
the rat due to the limited availability of the tissue, we
prepared primary culture of pig parathyroid cells. previously
it has been shown that, in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells,
calcitriol reduced the expression of pth [12]. our results
using the pig parathyroid cells are consistent that vdras
suppress pth mrna expression and inhibit parathyroid cell
proliferation.  xxxd2851xxx  and active  xxxd1935xxx  have no
significant eﬀects on modulating the vdr mrna level in the
parathyroid cells, although  xxxd2851xxx  seems more eﬀective
in inducing the expression of  xxxg343xxx  mrna.  xxxd2851xxx  may
“prime” the parathyroid cells to become more sensitive to
serum ca since  xxxd2851xxx  is less eﬀective in raising serum
ca levels.
we demonstrate by confocal microscopy that vdra
treatment of the pig parathyroid cells increases vdr staining
in the nucleus, which can be seen as early as 30 minutes
after the addition of  xxxd2851xxx  or active  xxxd1935xxx .
the observation, consistent with our previous studies in
the hl-60  xxxg1785xxx  cells, demonstrates that
vdr resides predominantly in the cytoplasm of the pig
parathyroid cells in the absence of vdras, and vdra
treatment induces vdr to translocate into the nucleus [13].

our observations seem to suggest that diﬀerent vdras may
have diﬀerential eﬀects on the subcellular distribution of
vdr after a prolonged incubation period. it is well known
that binding of agonists to the receptor stabilizes the vdr
via protecting the receptor from proteolytic degradation.
therefore, it is possible that the diﬀerent eﬀects of these two
compounds on nuclear vdr staining could be an indication
of a diﬀerential intraparathyroid catabolism of the ligandbound vdr.
from this study, we demonstrated that the eﬀect of
vdras on suppressing serum pth involves multiple factors
such as regulation of pth and  xxxg343xxx  mrna expression,
inhibition of parathyroid cell proliferation, and modulation
of serum ca. these observations reflect the complexity of
the vitamin d axis in regulating the mineral homeostasis
system.
