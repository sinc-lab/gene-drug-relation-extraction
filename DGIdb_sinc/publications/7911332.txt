abstract: this study surveys the total community prescription use of benzodiazepine agents in australia
for the years 1990 and 1991. also included is information on the utilisation of these agents on the
pharmaceutical benefits and repatriation pharmaceutical benefits schemes (pbs/rf‘bs) over the period
1987 to 1991. the australian data are from the drug utilization subcommittee (dusc) database, which is
derived from two sources: the pbs/rpbs (subsidised prescriptions), and a national sample of pharmacy
guild of australia pharmacies (private and under-copayment general prescriptions). the data are
converted to defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (ddd/looo/day) in accordance with the
unit of measurement for drug utilisation studies approved by the world health organization.
benzodiazepine utilisation was 33.96 ddd/looo/day for 1990 and 29.31 ddd/1000/day for 1991. the
four drugs listed on the pharmaceutical: benefits scheme, namely diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam and
temazepam, constituted 82 per cent of the australian market. the availability of government subsidy
appears to influence benzodiazepine- prescribing behaviour. benzodiazepine utilisation has been falling
in recent years. the fall may be related to the impact of new guidelines and community awareness
campaigns. there are major differences in the composition of the market between australia and the
nordic countries. (aurt j public health 1993; 17: 345-9)

t

e prescribing and use of benzodiazepines
have been a matter of controversy since firm
evidence of a withdrawal syndrome associated
with long-term use in therapeutic doses became
available. guidelines for their prescriptimon have
been forthcoming from a number of sources and
a report from the drug utilization subcommittee of the pharmaceutical benefitsadvisory committee. correspondence to the secretary, dusc, department of health, housing, local
government and community services, po box 9848, woden,

these generally advisejudicious use in the short term
and the avoidance of daily use beyond one m ~ n t h . ~ - ~
monitoring the impact of such guidelines requires a
system of drug-use monitoring to be in place.
since 1988 the drug utilization subcommittee
(dusc) of the pharmaceutical benefits advisory
committee (pbac) has been investigating ways of
providing comprehensive and valid prescriptiondrug utilisation data in australia.

maceutical benefits scheme (pbs) and repatriation
pharmaceutical benefits scheme (rpbs) are potentially valuable sources of information on community
drug dispensing but these records have become inadequate for the purpose of reviewing the total usage of
some drugs. this is because the prices of many drugs
fall below the level of the contribution by the patient,
the copayment, which rose from $4 in 1985 to $16 in
1993. moreover, many drugs are not listed on the
pbs or rpbs and are available only on private
prescription.
the dusc has been working for a number of years
to develop and evaluate improvements to this drugutilisation database. as an initial step, the pbs/rpbs
pensioner category was used to give a qualitative picture of australian dispensing as, before november
1990, pensioners did not pay a patient contribution
and thus full capture of this group was available.’
this approach was then extended to cover general
pbs beneficiaries by examining drug groups of clinical importance, such as the lipid lowering agents,
which are priced above the patient copayment and
hence are returned for subsidy.8 complete community dispensing data were available at this time
only on the pensioner/concessional group or on
drugs priced above the patient copayment.
however, to provide a similar examination of the
benzodiazepines, which have all been priced under
the patient copayment (as a general benefit) since
july 1985, required the development of a major new
database. the department of health, housing,
local government and community services, guided
by the dusc, established a database that combines
actual pbs/rpbs data with an estimate of private
and under-copayment (drugs which cost less than the
copayment) drug use.
this article presents, for the first time, comprehensive community prescription statistics on the utilisation of benzodiazepines in australia. patterns of
use are discussed with reference to the findings of the
1989-1 990 national health survey.9

methods
the database from which the present analysis is
derived is constructed from two sources, firstly information available as a byproduct of the australian
government subsidy payment for drugs through the
pbs/rpbs, and secondly, information from community pharmacies. from mid-1989 onwards, a random sample of 240 pharmacies belonging to the
pharmacy guild of australia (to which about 80 per
cent of australian pharmacies belong) forwarded an
extra copy of the monthly usage of all dispensed
drugs to chemdata, a pharmacy computer services
company. details identifymg the pharmacy were
deleted and the information was collated, summarised by drug code and category and forwarded to
dusc.‘o
within the department, the drug codes were
reclassified via a mapping program to the internationally accepted anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system. for each international code,
the database included the generic name, form and
strength of each preparation, the amount of active
ingredient in a unit of the prescription and the
defined daily dose (ddd) of the substance (table 1).
346

the defined daily dose was established by the nordic
council on medicines and the who drug utilization
research group on the basis of the assumed average
dose per day of the drug, used for its main indication
by adults.” it is the internationally accepted unit of
measurement for drug utilisation statistics and allows
for comparisons independent of differences in price,
preparation and quantity per prescription. the statistic, ddd per 1000 inhabitants per day, gives an estimate of the prevalence of use in the population,
although some caution is needed in such an
interpretation, as the ddd is clearly an indirect
measure of prevalence.
the dusc database provides information in prescription counts and ddd per 1000 inhabitants per
day for each generic form in each of the dispensing
categories applying in australia. eight categories of
dispensing are included in the database: pensioner,
repatriation, concessional, safety-net, doctor’s bag,
general benefit, under-copayment and private. in
this paper, the categories have been collapsed
into:
1. pbs/rpbs: the first six categories of the eight
listed above, to give a total volume for subsidised
dispensing where a government contribution was
made to the cost of the medication to the
patient
2. survey: categories seven and eight, where there
was no direct government contribution.
these two summary categories, ‘pbs/rpbs’ and
‘survey’ can be summed to give an estimate of the
total of all dispensing through community pharmacies in australia.
the guild survey information is the only australian source available which allows estimation of
under-copayment and private categories of dispensing. it is reasonable to assume that data from the
survey pharmacies were accurate, as stock control is a
basic and necessary function for any pharmacy. correlation of the estimates for the pbs/rpbs volumes
from the survey with the actual pbs/rpbs volumes is
high.i2 nonetheless, the figures from the guild survey were estimates, not actual totals of dispensed
prescriptions.
the database for the pbs/rpbs was established in
1987, making it possible to examine trends in the
subsidised segment of dispensing in australia. however, as guild data were not available until mid-1989
it is not possible to exarnine trends in the total volume
of dispensing for these drugs in earlier years.
results

years 1990 and 1991, both as volumes of prescrip
tions and as ddds per 1000 inhabitants per day, is

tants per day. over the same period the population
growth was 250500 (1.4 per cent).
based on the above estimates of total community
use for 1990, enough benzodiazepines were dispensed in 1990 to provide an average daily dose every
day for about 3 per cent of the australian population, that is, about 540 000 persons. from data on
benzodiazepine utilisation in the 1989-1990
national health surveyg it was estimated that there
were over 750 000 users of benzodiazepines of whom
approximately 330 000 were using the drugs daily for
six months or longer,iyconfirming the dispensing
data accessed from the dusc database.

the distribution of benzodiazepine utilisation in
australia for 1990 is presented in table 3, together
with those for the nordic countries (norway,
sweden, finland, denmark and iceland).
discussion
the overall prescription volume for benzodiazepines
in 1991 was 9.2 1 million, with an estimated total consumption of 29.31 ddd per 1000 inhabitants per
day (table 2). these figures represent a nearly 14 per
cent drop from the previous year (1990) of 10.55 million prescriptions and 33.96 ddd per 1000 inhabi-

utilisation of individual benzodiazepines in australia
four drugs, diazepam, oxazepam, temazepam and
nitrazepam, have approximately equal market shares
and together account for 82 per cent of all
benzodiazepine utilisation in australia (table 2).
flunitrazepam has the next largest market share with
310 989 prescriptions in 1991, but this is well below
the volumes for the four leading agents. the remaining benzodiazepines have appreciably lower levels of
utilisation in australia.
utilisation of individual benzodiazepines appears
to be influenced by the availability of government
subsidy. the four benzodiazepines dominating the
australian market are the only four of the group with
pbs listing. subsidised benzodiazepines represented
62 per cent of total community use in 1990 and 64
per cent in 1991. several other benzodiazepines
( xxxd369xxx , clorazepate, flunitrazepam,
 xxxd2140xxx  and lorazepam) are listed on the rpbs
but not on the pbs. the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme serves the needs of around
210000 veterans, so access to government subsidy
under this scheme is restricted.
the general patient copayment rose to $5.00 for
each dispensed pbs item in 1985. since then, however, the cost of the listed benzodiazepines has been
below the patient copayment, so that for general
patients, these prescriptions are no longer forwarded
to the government for subsidy. this explains the
appreciable volumes of non-pbs/rpbs dispensing
shown in figure 1. most of this non-pbs/rpbs dispensing remains concentrated on the four pbs-listed
drugs. this indicates that even with patients who do
not receive a subsidy (because the price is below the
patient copayment), listing of a drug on the pbs
appears to influence prescribing behaviour.

munity benzodiazepine utilisation. the absence of
financial barriers would appear to contribute to the
high utilisation by this group, although psychosocial
factors must also be involved. length of time on the
market varies for these different products, from
diazepam, the progenitor of the group, through to
the most recent addition, alprazolam. in addition,
the level of activity promoting each of these products
presumably influences utilisation, but no objective
information about this is available.

other nonclinical factors which may influence utilisation include the price to the patient, promotional
activity and the attitude of the public and the profession towards the appropriateness of use of this
class of drug.19j9so far as the price to the patient is
concerned, beneficiaries of the department of social
security receive listed drugs through the pbs either
free or with a small copayment. this group r e p
resents 28 per cent of the total population and, from
the dusc database, 57 per cent of the total com-

triazolam has surprisingly high utilisation in all of
the nordic countries except sweden. this
benzodiazepine has negligible use in australia as it
entered the market only in 1989 and is not listed on
the pbs or rpbs. given the controversy over the
adverse effects of triazolam, the drug evaluation system in australia, (known for its caution) may, with
hindsight, have been wise in protecting the australian consumer from wider exposure to this
drug.17

internutional comparisons
total benzodiazepine utilisation is considerably
higher in the nordic countries than in australia. for
1990 the range was 45.7 ddd per 1000 inhabitants
per day for sweden to 81.4 ddd per 1000 inhabitants per day for denmark, which is from 1.5 to over
2.5 times the australian utilisation.i4-l6part, but not
all, of the difference may be because the nordic figures are wholesale data and include hospital use,
whereas the australian data represent community
dispensing only.

as well as there being wide international variation
in overall utilisation, there are marked differences in
market share of individual benzodiazepines between
the countries (table 3). in australia, the market is
dominated by the four pbs-listed drugs which have
approximately equal market shares, as previously discussed. diazepam has a dominant market share in all
countries. relative to australia, oxazepam has low
use in several of the nordic countries, while
temazepam has low use in denmark and is not marketed in iceland, norway and sweden. nitrazepam
has a substantial market share in the nordic
countries. flunitrazepam is popular in all nordic
countries except finland.

benzodiazepine utlllsatlon

the australian data do not cover hospital utilisation
which the nordic data suggest could be important.
review within the drug utilization subcommittee of
utilisation of cardiovascular drugs in a sample of hospitals suggests that they account for 1 to 5 per cent of total
utilisation of drugs in that group. thus, hospitaldispensed drugs in general probably do not greatly modify the australian picture.
trends in beru,odiazepine dispensing
the pbs/rpbs-subsidised portion of benzodiazepine dispensing, asjudged by prescription volumes
and ddds per 1000 per day, has been falling since 1988.
there was a sharp fall from 1990 to 1991 (which
appeared to be related mainly to the patient copayment
changes of november 1990)which included for the first
time the introduction of a s m a l l pensioner copayment
($2.50). however, the decrease in utilisation from 1990
to 1991 was also seen in the nonsubsidised portion of
benzodiazepine dispensing (table 2), so other factors
apart from the effect of patient contribution are
involved. the fall may have been related to the new
pdelines and community awareness campaigns which
followed a better understanding of the problem of
dependence on these agents.-.i8.lq
of concern is the possibility that tricyclic
antidepressants could be substituted for benzodiazepines. the dusc database will allow such a change
in prescribing to be monitored. for pbs/rpbs dispensing, there has been no major change in
antidepressant utilisation since 1987, barring evidence
of hoarding before, and consequent drop in use after,
the pensioner copayment. prescription volumes for
antidepressants were 3.4 million in 1987, 1988 and
1989, 3.6 million in 1990 and 3.3 million in 1991.
time trends for pbs/rpbs dispensing of the four
major benzodiazepines, expressed as ddds per 1000
inhabitants per day, are compared in figure 2. between
1987 and 1990, diazepam utilisation remained stable,
whereas utilisation of both oxazepam and nitmepam
decreased. in contrast, temazepam utilisation increased
each year over this period. it has steadily increased its
market share since being listed on the pbs in 1980. a
similar growth in market share was seen for diazepam
and oxazepam after they were listed on ihe pbs.")."
notably, pbs/rpbs dispensingof all four drugs (including temazepam) decreased in 1991, resulting in the fall
in total benzodiazepine dispensing mentioned previously. the eventual impact on utilisation trends of the
introduction of the pensioner copayment is not yet clear
but it merits close monitoring to see whether the downward trend continues.
a recent and useful review of psychoactive drug prescribing in tasmania estimated benzodiaz.epine utilisation for the population in that state as 47.8 ddd per
1000 inhabitants per day in 1989." this figure is much
higher than the estimated total communityutilisation for
australia. the difference may reflect local influences,
such as are apparent among the nordic countries. however, the estimates for tasmania are based on data from
a relatively small sample of 11 communitypharmacies.
the development of this new pharmacoepidemiological database represents ari important
advance for drug utilisation studies in australia. the
dusc database represents the total dispensing picture
in communitypharmacy and, by adoption of the defind
daily dose and the international anatomical therapeutic

chemical code methodology, allows international comparisons to be made for the first time. the variations in
utilisation highlight our imperfect understanding of
influences on prescribing and the importance of factors
other than health.
