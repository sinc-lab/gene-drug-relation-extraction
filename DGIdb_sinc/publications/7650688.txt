a new pharmacophoric model for the hi-antagonist binding site is derived which reveals that
a simple atom to atom matching of compounds is not sufficient; in this model, interacting
residues from the receptor need to be included. to obtain this model, the bioactive
conformations of several (semi-)rigid classical histamine hi-receptor antagonists have been
investigated ( xxxd1785xxx ,  xxxd2904xxx , triprolidine, epinastine,  xxxd2572xxx , ibf28145,
and  xxxd2637xxx ). in general, these antihistamines contain two aromatic rings and a basic
nitrogen atom. a previously derived pharmacophoric model with the nitrogen position fixed
relative to the two aromatic rings is now found not to be suitable for describing the hi-antagonist
binding site. a procedure is described which allows for significant freedom in the position of
the basic nitrogen of the histamine hi-antagonist. the area accessible to the basic nitrogen is
confined to the region accessible to its counterion on the histamine hi-receptor, le., the
carboxylate group of asp116. the basic nitrogen is assumed to form an ionic hydrogen bond
with this  xxxd233xxx  which ca- and cp-carbons are fured with respect to the protein backbone.
via this hydrogen bond, the direction of the acidic proton of the antagonist is taken into account.
within these computational procedures, an  xxxd233xxx  is coupled to the basic nitrogen of
each hi-antagonist considered; the carboxylate group is connected to the positively charged
nitrogen via geometric h-bonding restraints obtained from a thorough database search (csd).
also to the basic nitrogen of the pharmacophore is coupled an  xxxd233xxx  (to yield our new
template). in order to derive a model for the hi-antagonist binding site, the aromatic ring
systems of the antagonists and template are matched according to a previously described
procedure. subsequently, the ca- and cp-carbons of the  xxxd233xxx  coupled to the
hi-antagonists are matched with those of the template in a procedure which allows the
antagonist and the carboxylate group to adapt their conformation (and also their relative
position) in order to optimize the overlap with the template. a six-point pharmacophoric model
is derived which has stereoselective features and is furthermore able to distinguish between
the so-called “cis”- and “trans”-rings mentioned in many (q)sar studies on hi-antagonists.
due to its stereoselectivity, the model is able to designate the absolute bioactive configuration
of antihistamines such as  xxxd2904xxx  (s),epinastine (si,and ibf28145 (r). a further merit
of this study is that a model is obtained which includes an amino acid from the receptor. since
this amino acid has been identified t o be asp116,tools are now available to dock the antagonists
with the  xxxd233xxx  coupled t o the nitrogen in a homology model of the receptor, while
matching the coupled aspartate with asp116 of the protein. the most likely (energetically
favorable) binding site for the antagonists can then be determined by allowing for rotation
around the ca-cb bond, while leaving the position of ca and cp unchanged. since several
homology models can be built for the protein depending on the alignment chosen, the likelihood
of the binding site and especially the (dislagreement with (q)sarand biological data will give
clues for the most probable 3d-model (i.e., alignment) of the protein (studies in progress). the
underlying approach which includes known interacting amino acids from the receptor into a
pharmacophoric model is of general importance for verifying protein models with limited
reliability, such as models derived for g-protein-coupled receptors from bacteriorhodopsin.

e.g., figure 1). although initially the expectations for
the therapeutic use of these so-called “classical”histamine hi-antagonists against allergic disorders were
very high, the application of these drugs has been rather
limited, mainly because of severe central side effects,
especially sedation.

cal structures of these drugs (e.g.,  xxxd236xxx , temelastine, terfenadine,  xxxd2572xxx , epinastine, cetirizine,
and loratadine) often deviate from the basic structure
of classical antihistamines. recently, a study on a series
of sedating and nonsedating hi-blockers demonstrated
that nonsedative hi-antagonists fulfill specific lipophilicity criteria which prevent them from brain penetration.2
for the purpose of rational drug design based on
structure-activity information, one is confined to data
mainly concerning so called classical antagonist^.^
qsar studies indicate that para substitution with a
small lipophilic group group (i.e., ch3, c1) is favorable
for only one of the two aromatic rings of classical hiantagonists (figure 1). on the basis of a comparison
with diphenylaminopropene analogues (e.g., triprolidine
3, figure 1)the latter ring is called the “~is”-ring.~
the
aromatic character of this ring seems to be indispensable for hi-activity. in contrast, the second aromatic
“trans”-ringcan be replaced by nonaromatic lipophilic
groups (e.g., cyclohexyl) without drastic effects on hiblocking activity. obviously, the different receptor
environment of the two ring systems is responsible for
the stereoselectivity observed for many hi-antagonists,
e.g., the trans-isomer of triprolidine 3 is 1000 times
more active than the cis-isomer and the r-isomer of 8
(4-methyldiphenhydramine,figure 1)is 100 times more
active than the s - i ~ o m e r . ~ - ~
three-dimensional models describing the structural
features of histamine hi-receptor antagonists are generally based upon the semirigid and potent hi-antagonist  xxxd1785xxx  1.6-8 most of the early 3d-models
were derived from flexible hi-antagonists for which only
one conformation was considered (crystal structure6 or
global minimum’). in later years, when lack of cpu
time was not so much an issue, van drooge et al.
derived a five-point pharmacophore by matching lowenergy conformations of the semirigid and potent hiantagonists  xxxd2904xxx  (2) and triprolidine (3) on six

always be matched with the position of the template
nitrogen in the boat3 conformation of 1. therefore, we
allowed for a certain flexibility in the position of the
nitrogen. for this purpose, an approach was developed
which considers the several interaction possibilities
between a basic nitrogen and an  xxxd233xxx  in the
histamine hi-receptor. the introduction of an aspartate

site-directed
mutagenesis study on the histaminergic hi-receptor
confirms our hypothesis by showing that the aspartate
conserved in all aminergic g-protein coupled receptors
(asp116)interacts with the classical hi-antagonist  xxxd3050xxx .13 in our strategy, we further assume that
the cis- and trans-rings of 1-7 have a preferred orientation within the antagonist binding site, resulting in a
relative position toward the c,- and cp-carbons of the
aspartate. furthermore, we implicitly assume that all
antagonists considered bind to the same site. these
considerations lay the foundation for our model.
in order to derive a new pharmacophoric model for
the hi-antagonist binding site, low-energy conformations of compounds 2-7 (figure l) are superimposed
on six previously derived low-energy conformations of
 xxxd1785xxx .8 an aspartate is coupled to the basic
nitrogen of each hi-antagonist and t o the template
conformations of 1 (figure 2a). for this coupling,
geometric constraints are obtained from a statistical
analysis of the cambridge structural database with
respect to the specific type of hydrogen-bonding interaction. in a first step the aromatic rings of the antagonist
and the template are matched. subsequently,a “unique”
position for the c,- and cp-atoms of the aspartate is
derived by allowing for flexibility in the asparate side
chain. in this second step the positions of the ring
systems of the antagonist are fixed relative to those of
the pharmacophore, while the ca’s and cp’s are being
matched (figure 2c). a n additional advantage of this
approach compared to all previous approaches is that
the directionality of the hydrogen bond between the
basic nitrogen and the aspartate is automatically taken
into account. the stereoselectivity of the model is
determined in a final step, where the flexible and
stereoselective isomers of 8 are used to designate the
cis- and trans-ring of our pharmacophoric model. our
approach results in a new and stereoselective pharmacophore defined by the relative positions of the c,- and
cp-carbons of an  xxxd233xxx  of the hi-receptor (probably asp116)positioned relative to the cis- and transring of classical histamine hi-antagonists.

methods
investigated compounds (figure 1). in the present
modeling study we consider the (semi-)rigid histamine hiantagonists 1-7 and the stereoselective isomers of 4-methyldiphenhydramine 8. from displacement experiments with
i'$hlmepyramine (guinea pig cerebellum membranes, 30 min),
it is evident that compounds 1-4 and 7-8 are potent hiantagonists with apparent pk, values of 9.27 ( l ) , 8.20 (2), 8.78
(3, cis/trans mixture), 8.85 (4), 9.07 (71, and 7.91 ( 8 , ris
mixture).'l the high potencies of these compounds have also
been measured in other, different, and therefore incomparable
functional systems, for example, pa2(l) = 9, pa2(2) = 8.8, pa2(3)= 9.9, -log(ics0)(4) = 8.8, and pa2(8) = 8.7 (in contrast to
a value of 6.8 for the s-isomer of
l8 the potencies for 5
and 6 are reported by barbe et al. as being 7.2 and 7.3,
respectively (pedso values measured on guinea pig ileum).l 9
however, a binding constant of 8.0 was reported for 5 by
leysen et al. (displacement of l3hlmepyramine from guinea
pig cerebellum membranes after 30 min), and even higher
picsovalues (up to 9.0) were measured a t longer incubation
times.20
the activities of the potent and (semi-)rigid hi-antagonists
used in this study are measured in different pharmacological
systems and should therefore not be compared quantitatively.
for this reason no relative weights were given to the compounds during the construction of the present hi-antagonist
model.

stem from the classical definition of bond dipoles and thus
correspond to the mm2 dipoles exactly. for the dielectric
constant a value of 1 was used (batchmin user manual
version 4.0, columbia university, new york).
fit procedures. in the present study two different fit
procedures were used (chem-x, january 1990). the first
approach corresponds to the one described earlier in which two
neighboring aromatic rings and a basic nitrogen of a n hiantagonist are matched with a five-point pharmacophore.r
each aromatic ring is represented by two dummy atoms, 1.8
a above and below the centroid of the ring. low-energy
conformations of compounds 2-8 are superimposed on the
template conformations of 1 ( t h t pharmacophore) using restraint constants of 10 kcal/(mol*a2)for the dummies and 100
for the basic nitrogen. the compounds are first matched by
allowing for global rotations and translations only (rigid
match). in a subsequent step (flexible fit) the internal nonbonded energy of the antagonist is minimized with respect to
user-defined exocyclic bonds (compound 2, 1 rotatable bond;
3, 4 bonds; 5 , 2; 6, 1; and 8, 6) and the penalty functions
(restraints). endocyclic nitrogen inversion was considered for
compounds 4-7. also the nonplanar ring system(s) of compounds 1, 2, 4, and 7 can adopt several distinct low-energy
conformations due to variations around endocyclic bonds.
therefore, all low-energy conformations of compounds 1-2 and
4- 7 generated manually or with macromodel were considered
separately in the above procedure. for compounds 3 and 8
(only exocyclic torsions), only the ges was considered since
the restraint constants are high enough to overcome the small
energy barriers present.
in the second approach, a n  xxxd233xxx  is coupled to the
basic nitrogen of each investigated antagonist and the template conformations of 1 (figure 2a). the carboxylate group
is connected to the protonated tertiary amino group (all
compounds except 4) according to geometric constraints derived from a statistical analysis (gstat88) on 23 structures
describing the interaction between a tertiary amino and a
carboxylate (cambridge structural database, oct. 1992;21

compound 4 contains a fused guanidino group. a carboxylate is connected using geometric constraints derived from a
study on arginine-carboxylate interactions.22 the geometry
of this bidentate complex (i.e., a methylguanidinoaspartate
moiety) was optimized using ab initio methods (gamess,
sto-3g basis set). although this so-called anti i1 geometry
involves two hydrogen bonds, only one is used to connect the
aspartate to the guanidino of 4 (figure 3b) (see discussion).

such a n h-bond. this energy was used for determining he

results and discussion
conformational analysis of  xxxd1785xxx (1).
the major reason for using the potent hi-antagonist 1
as a template molecule is its relative rigidity. the
piperidylene ring may attain two chair and four boat
conformations (see also ref 8). including the two different attachments of the n-methyl group being either
axial or equatorial, 12 different low-energy conformations are obtained (table l). the relative energies of
these ab initio optimized conformations indicate chair1
with the n-methyl group equatorial (chairleq)to be the
ges; this conformation is also found in x-ray studies
on  xxxd1785xxx .25 more importantly,
ih-nmr experiments show that chairleq and chair2eq
are the only conformations observed in solution (cdc13)
occurring in a ratio of about 4:1.26 this is in agreement
with our data in table 1.
consequently, three conformations of 1were considered as possible templates: the two conformations
observed in solution (chairleq and chair2eq) and boaeeq,
since this conformation has earlier been suggested to
be the bioactive conformation.8
conformationanalysis of  xxxd2904xxx  (2) and
triprolidine (3). the chiral molecule  xxxd2904xxx 
2 and the nonchiral trans-triprolidine 3 are two semirigid hi-antagonists used in the study by van drooge
et al8 it is worthwhile mentioning that the double bond
of  xxxd2904xxx  can either be in the piperidyl ring (as
in 2, figure 1)or in between the phenyl group and the
piperidyl ring (not shown). thus  xxxd2904xxx  can be
isolated in two epimeric forms, their ratio depending on
the salt or free base being formed.27 the structural
formula 2 depicted in figure 1is representative for the
commercially available  xxxd2904xxx  tartrate salt and
is reported to be the bioactive epimer of  xxxd2904xxx .28
taking into account the likely epimerization of  xxxd2904xxx , it is interesting to note that no one has ever
separated stereoisomers of 2. since no information is
available on the absolute configuration of the bioactive
epimer 2, both stereoisomers of 2 were considered in
the fitting procedures.
the relative rigidity of 2 is due to the limited
flexibility of the fused tetrahydropyridine ring and the
presence of only one freely rotatable bond. we found
that the tetrahydropyridine ring can adopt two different
boatlike conformations which differ only 0.5 kcavmol
in internal energy (ab initio, sv4-31g basis). as the
n-methyl group can either be in the favorable equatorial
or in the less favorable axial position, four local minima
are obtained all within 1.8 kcallmol from the global
minimum (figure 4).

formational analysis resulted in a global energy structure (ges) with the a-pyridyl ring and the double bond
almost in the same plane (deviation 22"); the substituted
phenyl ring is rotated out of this plane by -59".
considering the many low-energy conformations of 3 (4
rotatable bonds) and low-energy barriers between the
local minima, only the ges was used for flexible fitting
purposes. starting from other low-energy conformations for this specific compound is unlikely to influence
the final results.
conformation analysis of epinastine (4), phenothiazine derivatives 5 and 6, and  xxxd2637xxx 
(7). epinastine 4 is a highly rigid and basic compound
with a pka of -11.2 all theoretically possible conformations and tautomers of the protonated form were built
and optimized. tautomers with two protons at nitrogen
n2 (see figure 5) are at least 36 kcavmol more favorable
(sv 4-31g basis set) than tautomers with the acidic
proton attached to n1 or n3. therefore, the tautomer
depicted in figure 2 is likely to be the bioactive
protonated species of 4. in total, six conformations are
possible for 4: a, b, and c for both the s- and r-isomer
(figure 5). the large ab initio energy differences
indicate that conformation a is probably active at hireceptors. it is important to mention that 4 can be
methylated at n3 (thereby replacing the n3-hydrogen)
without losing antihistamininic activity; in fact this
compound is 2 times more active than 4 itself.29 on the
basis of this observation, the ionic hydrogen bond
between 4 and a protein carboxylate is assumed to be
formed with n2 and not with n3.
as the tricyclic phenothiazine part of compounds 5
and 6 is symmetric, interconversion of the thiazine ring
does not yield different conformations. however, inversion of the ring nitrogen can put the side chain either
in an axial or equatorial orientation. the local minima
resulting from the conformational analyses show that
the equatorial position is energetically more favorable
than the axial position (ab initio ae: 3.40 kcavmol for
5 and 1.44 kcavmo1 for 6). for fitting purposes, both
the equatorial and axial conformers were considered.
since the carbon connecting the tricyclic part with the
3-quinuclidinyl group is chiral, two stereoisomers were
also investigated.
although  xxxd2637xxx  (7) has no freely rotatable
bonds, the molecule is relatively flexible. the fused
piperazinyl ring can be oriented either axial or equatorial at both the central chiral carbon and the neighboring nitrogen (nitrogen inversion). as a consequence,
this ring can attain several chair, boat, and twisted boat
conformations. conformational analysis yielded six lowenergy piperazinyl chair conformations. the ges is a
chair with the n-methyl in an equatorial position (sv431g basis set). all low-energy conformations of both
stereoisomers were considered in the fitting procedures.

that antihistaminics 4-7 could not be fitted on the
previously assumed bioactive boat3eq conformation of
 xxxd1785xxx .8 although the aromatic rings of 4-7
match the pharmacophore well, the nitrogens of especially 4,5, and 7 hardly match (distance >0.8 a; table

between boat3eq and the global minimum chairleq is
substantially higher with ab initio methods (ae:6.08
kcavmo1) than with semiempirical methods (mndo:
aahf: 2.7 kcavmol), we questioned the validity of boat3
as a possible pharmacophore.8
on the basis of the above observations, we focused
our attention on chairleq and chairaeq, which are found
in solution and have the lowest ab initio energies. we
found that only a limited number of compounds could
be fitted on the two five-point pharmacophores represented by chairleq (compounds 2 and 3) and chair2eq
(compounds 2 , 3 and 5). in all other combinations (le.,
4,6, and 7 on chair2eq and 4-7 on chairleq), the fit of
the basic nitrogens was not satisfactory (n-n distances
>0.5 a; table 2).
in summary, the fit results, partially presented in
table 2, demonstrate that the basic nitrogen of hireceptor antagonists does not occupy one particular
position in space with respect to the position of the
aromatic rings. we therefore conclude that a five-point
pharmacophore derived from either chairleq, chair2eq,
or boat3eq is not sufficient to describe the histamine
hi-antagonist binding site.
a pharmacophore with a variable position for
the basic nitrogenatom. from the results presented
in table 2, we anticipated that the ionic interaction
between the basic nitrogen and the hi-receptor should
have a relatively large positional freedom. we therefore
introduced an  xxxd233xxx  into our model with which
the antagonists interact and which represents an  xxxd233xxx  from the receptor. a penalty function was
put on the position of the c,- and cp-carbons; no
restraints were put on the basic nitrogens. this approach results in a six-point pharmacophore, while at
the same time sufficient attention is given to the
directionality of the acidic proton.
for the construction of the new pharmacophore, the
experimentally observed chairleq and chair2eq were
considered as templates. in the two conformations, the
acidic hydrogens have opposite directions which is
illustrated by the different positions of the aspartate in
figure 6. since preliminary fitting experiments showed
that the acidic hydrogens in chairlax and chair2ax point
approximately in a similar direction as in the aboveinvestigated chair2eq and chairleq conformations (see
table l), these axial conformations were not further
investigated.
it was observed that when more than three molecules
were fitted simultaneously according to the flexible
fitting procedure described in figure 2c, the number
of restraints prevented the c,- and cg-atoms from
converging. therefore at maximum two compounds out
of the series 2-7 were simultaneously fit on 1. each
compound was combined with several other compounds
(starting with the most rigid ones) in order to derive
the most likely template molecule. in case a template

was rejected, it was checked whether the outcome was
not an artefact of the applied restraints.
especially in the fits of 4 and 5 on 1, a clear
distinction is present between the quality of the fits on
chairleq and chair2eq (figure 6). within our predefined criteria, epinastine 4 does not fit on chairleq
due to low fit quality of the aromatic rings; the centroids
have at best deviations of 0.42 (ring i) and 1.00 a (ring
11), respectively. moreover, the cp of the aspartate
coupled to 4 could not be superimposed on the cp of
chairleq (cp-cp > 0.8 a). also the steric overlap
between 4 and chairleq is low (vdwexci = 34.2 a3)
compared to the overlap between 4 and chair2eq (vdwexc1 = 44.7 a
').
comparable results were found for  xxxd2572xxx  (5).
although the rings of 5 fitted well on both templates,
the aspartate of 5 did not match the chairleq aspartate
(cb-cp > 0.8 a). moreover, the 3-quinuclidinyl side
chain of 5 is forced to occupy a spatial area different
from the one occupied by the piperidylene side chain of
the template chairleq (vdwexcl=73.8 a3;figure 6). in
contrast, the fit on the chair2e aspartate appeared to
be much better (ca-ca = 0.07 cg-cg = 0.15 a) and
resulted in a large steric overlap (vdwexc1 = 8.0 hi3).

i,

the fit results for both 4 and 5 on 1 indicate that the
bioactive conformation of 1 most probably is chair2eq.
low-energy conformations of 4 (ges) and 5 (ae= 1.94
kcal/mol; table 3) have a good steric overlap with a lowenergy conformation of 1 (chairaeq, ae = 1.36 kcal/mol)
with respect to the aromatic rings and the side chains;
moreover, the three compounds are able to interact with
the same carboxylate group.
our tentative conclusions are supported by the remarkable good fits of compounds 2,3,6, and 7 on the
six-point chair2eq pharmacophore (table 3); because of
the limited flexibility of 2,6, and 7 , these results were
unexpected. figure 7 shows the conformations of 2-7
superimposed on chair2eq. the molecules show a good
fit with respect to the aromatic rings, relatively compact
steric boundaries of the various side chains and only
negligible variations in the position of the ca- and cgatoms of the postulated  xxxd233xxx . the model shows
that the interacting basic nitrogen occupies largely
different positions within the antagonist binding site.

bioactive, conformation appeared to be very close to the
global or a local minimum (table 3). for example, the
final conformation of  xxxd2904xxx  2 is a slightly
distorted version of conformation c (figure 4). an
acceptable ab initio energy of 3.58 kcavmol above ges
was found.
the internal energy of 3 is high relative to ges (ae
= 7.42 kcdmol, table 3). this is caused by the inability
of the chem-x force field to treat conjugated systems
in an appropriate way. the chem-x molecular mechanics force field easy rotates the aromatic rings out
of the plane of the conjugated double bond in order to
improve the fit, whereas ab initio methods assign
relatively high energies to these distorted systems. this
phenomenon can also be observed when 3 is fitted on
the three different conformations of 1in the absence of
an aspartate (table 2). even when the restraints on
the basic nitrogen or the aspartate are removed, the ring
systems of 3 and 1 are hard to match. this suggests
that in order to explain the high antagonistic activity

of 3,we might have to assume that the position of one
of the rings might be less restricted than that of the
second ring. this suggestion is supported by qsar
studies which indicate that the steric boundaries of the
trans-ring are relatively undefined compared to those
of the ~ i s - r i n g .the
~ probably unnecessary forced fit of
the trans-ring of 3 on the trans-ring of 1 explains the
relatively high internal energy of 3.
as a consequence of the above observations, the
orientation of the trans-ring in compounds 4-7 relative
to 1might also be too restricted. nonetheless, the ring
systems of 4-7 fitted extremely well on 1(table 3). the
lower fit quality is generally found for the more rigid
compounds 4 and 7. this is probably due to the
restriction of the n-h* -0 hydrogen bond angle and the
n-ha -0-c dihedral angle to their optimal values of
180" (figure 2). since the actual interaction is probably
less restricted, it is to be expected that relative internal
energies can be slightly overestimated (in the order of
a few kcavmo1).

in conclusion, the whole series of (semi-)rigid hiantagonists can be fitted well on a six-point pharmacophore (chair2eq coupled to an aspartate) illustrated
by high-quality fits, low intramolecular energies relative
to ges, and optimal interaction geometries with an hireceptor  xxxd233xxx .
definition of the cis- and trans-ring. one of the
aromatic rings of trans-triprolidine 3 is substituted with
ap-methyl group and has been defined as the cis-ring
of hi-antagonists. we found that the cis- and transring of 3 when fitted on 1cannot be interchanged. thus,
our model confirms the substantially lower affinity of
cis-triprolidine compared to trans-triprolidine 3 (see
introduction). the ring closest to the carboxylate group
(smallest distances between the ca-and cgatoms of the
 xxxd233xxx  and the centroids of the ring systems) is
defined as the cis-ring (figure 9).
at this stage of the study, it is important to mention
that the model still lacks stereoselectivity since for none
of the chiral compounds (2 and 4-7) the absolute
configuration of the bioactive stereoisomer is known. as
a consequence, two pharmacophores are possible: the
pharmacophore shown in figure 7 and its mirror image.
the pharmacophore with the appropriate stereochemistry can be found by fitting the potent and stereoselective isomers of 4-methyldiphenhydramine 8 on
chair2eq. for both isomers, the para-substituted ring
was fitted on the cis-ring of chair2eq. keeping the
aromatic rings optimally fitted on the template, only one
of the two mirror images of the pharmacophore appeared to be a good template for the most active
r-isomer of 8 (1.88 kcdmol above ges). in contrast,
the 100 times less potent s-isomer did not match well
with chair2eq unless the side chain was folded (best
f i t 11-04kcdmol above ges). figures 7 and 9 present
the pharmacophore in the appropriate configuration.

qualitative prediction of the stereoselectivity
of antihistamines 2,4, and 6. compound 8 made it
possible to determine the stereoselectivity of the model;
now we can qualitatively predict the absolute configuration of the bioactive stereoisomers of 2,4, and 6. we
found that only the s-isomer of 2, the s-isomer of 4,
and the r-isomer of 6 are able to fit the present
pharmacophore. the model also designates the phenyl
group of  xxxd2904xxx  2 as the cis-ring. also, the
aromatic ring of 4 closest in space to its guanidino group
is found to be comparable to the cis-ring (figure 9).
unfortunately, the pharmacophore does not unambiguously predict the stereoselectivity of 5 and 7.

 xxxd2572xxx  5 is represented by its r-isomer, whereas
the s-isomer fits equally well. this is not surprising
since the chiral center is relatively “far away” from the
aromatic ring systems when compared to 6.  xxxd2637xxx 
(7) is represented by its r-isomer, whereas also in this
case the mirror image (s-isomer)fits equally well. since
in the fits of the r- and s-isomers of 7 the aromatic rings
are interchanged, it is not possible to predict the
stereoselectivity of 7 and/or designate the putative cisand trans-ring.
the presented pharmacophore enables us to extrapolate the structure activity relationships obtained for
classical hi-antagonists to a 3d-model for (semi-)rigid
antihistamine^.^ also less rigid and/or nonclassical hiantagonists can be fitted in the pharmacophoric model
in order to elucidate their stereoselectivity and/or
designate their cis- and trans-rings. in general, the
model will be useful for understanding the binding
modes of nonclassical antagonists and for the design of
new, preferably nonsedating, antihistamines. in preliminary studies we have found that modern antihistamines such as terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx , loratadine, and
cetirizine also fit the model indeed. however, the “best”
fit cannot be assigned based on these results, since these
compounds usually have an additional flexible side
chain attached to the basic nitrogen which occupies an
area within the hi-receptornot described by the present
model.

since the directionality of the proton differs in the three
low-energy conformations and cypropheptadine is the
basis of our template.
(iv)the existence of several low-energy conformations
for  xxxd1785xxx  indicates that this compound possibly binds to the histamine and muscarine or serotonine receptors in different conformations. this might
further explain the different stereoselectivity observed
for histamine and muscarine antagonists.
(v)a model is obtained which includes one amino acid
of the receptor. since this amino acid has been identified to be asp116, tools are now available to dock the
antagonists in a homology model of the receptor while
matching the aspartate coupled t o the basic nitrogen of
the antagonist with asp116 of the protein. the most
likely (energetically favorable) binding site for the
antagonists can then be determined by allowing for
rotation around the c,-cp bond while leaving the
position of c, and cp unchanged. since several homology models can be built for the protein depending on
the alignment chosen (e.g., refs 30-321, a number of
possible binding sites will be obtained (one for each 3dmodeyalignment). the most probable binding site and
therefore the most probable alignment can be attained
when the energetics of the binding sites are compared,
i.e., by investigating whether the model explains observed biological data such as affinity values. furthermore, the properties of the binding site should explain
the known (q)sar data. both studies will give clues
on the most probable 3d-model (le., alignment) of the
protein. the underlying approach including known
protein interaction sites into a pharmacophoric model
is of general importance for verifying protein models
with limited reliability such as models derived for
gpcrs from bacteriorhodopsin. furthermore, these
interaction sites are necessary in case a simple atom to
atom matching of compounds is not sufficient t o derive
a model which can accommodate all investigated compounds. studies investigating several 3d-models for the
hi-receptor are in progress.
since our model is able to assign the bioactive
stereoisomers of phenindame (s-isomer),epinastine (sisomer), and ibf28145 (r-isomer)and further predicts
that the receptor binds these enantiomers with high
stereoselectivity, we encourage chiral separation of the
enantiomers of these compounds for further validation
of our model.
finally, the presented pharmacophoric model might
enhance insights into the sars of several other classes
of histamine hi-antagonists. in the near future we
intend to use our model as a basis for an extensive
comparative molecular field analysis (comfa)~~
and,
when possible, determine the bioactive conformation of
several classical and nonclassical hi-antagonists.
coordinates of the hi-antagonist pharmacophoric
model may be obtained from the authors (by e-mail:
donne@chem.vu.nl).

conclusions
a new pharmacophoric model for the histamine hiantagonist binding site has been derived which reveals
that a simple atom t o atom matching of compounds is
not sufficient anymore for describing the binding of an
extended series of antagonists but that interacting
residues from the receptor need to be included. the new
model allows for significant freedom in the position of
the basic nitrogen of the histamine hi-antagonist. the
area accessible to the basic nitrogen is confined t o the
region accessible to its counterion on the histamine hireceptor, i.e., the carboxylate group of asp116. the basic
nitrogen is assumed to form an ionic hydrogen bond
with this  xxxd233xxx  whose c,- and cg-carbons are
fixed with respect t o the protein backbone. via this
hydrogen bond the directionality of the acidic proton of
the antagonist is taken into account. a six-point pharmacophore is derived describingthe bioactive conformations of  xxxd1785xxx ,  xxxd2904xxx , triprolidine,
epinastine,  xxxd2572xxx , ibf28145, and  xxxd2637xxx .
the merits of this study are as follows.
(i) the pharmacophore is stereoselective and is able
to designate the absolute bioactive configuration of hiantagonists such as phenindame (s),epinastine (s),and
ibf28145 (r). since we did not succeed in accommodating the opposite enantiomers of these three
compounds, we conclude that the receptor is highly
stereoselecive for these componds.
(ii) the model is able t o distinguish between the socalled cis- and trans-rings mentioned in many (q)sar
studies on hi-antagonists.
(iii) the bioactive conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  is
revealed not be the ~ h a i r l e qor~ boat3eq

but chair2eq. this has important implications for the
docking of  xxxd1785xxx  (and other classical hiantagonists) into three-dimensional receptor models
