 xxxd2113xxx , a class ic antiarrhythmic, was shown to improve myotonia caused by sodium channel
mutations in situations where the class ib antiarrhythmic drug mexiletine was less efficient. yet
little is known about molecular interactions between  xxxd2113xxx  and human skeletal muscle
sodium (hnav 1.4) channels. whole-cell sodium currents (i na ) were recorded in tsa201 cells
expressing wild-type (wt) and mutant hnav 1.4 channels (r1448c, paramyotonia congenita;
g1306e, potassium-aggravated myotonia). at a holding potential (hp) of –120 mv,  xxxd2113xxx 
use-dependently blocked wt and g1306e i na equally but was more potent on r1448c channels.
for wt, the extent of block depended on a holding voltage more negative than the activation
threshold, being greater at –90 mv as compared to –120 and –180 mv. this behaviour was
exacerbated by the r1448c mutation since block at –120 mv was greater than that at –180 mv.
thus  xxxd2113xxx  can bind to inactivated sodium channels in the absence of channel opening.
nevertheless, all the channels showed the same closed-state affinity constant (k r ∼480 µm)
and the same inactivated-state affinity constant (k i ∼18 µm). simulations according to the
modulated receptor hypothesis mimic the voltage-dependent block of wt and mutant channels
by  xxxd2113xxx  and mexiletine. all the results suggest similar blocking mechanisms for the two
drugs. yet, since  xxxd2113xxx  exerts use-dependent block at lower frequency than mexiletine, it
may exhibit greater benefit in all myotonic syndromes. moreover,  xxxd2113xxx  blocks hnav 1.4
channel mutants with a rightward shift of availability voltage dependence more specifically than
mexiletine, owing to a lower k r /k i ratio. this study offers a pharmacogenetic strategy to better
address treatment in individual myotonic patients.

excessive and sustained firing of action potentials in
the skeletal muscle results in myotonia, a disorder
characterized by long-lasting involuntary contractions
leading to muscle stiffness. the genes responsible for
inherited non-dystrophic myotonias have been identified
as those encoding the skeletal muscle voltage-gated
chloride or sodium channels, which lead to a loss or
a gain, respectively, of gating function of the channel
protein (cannon, 2001; jurkat-rott et al. 2002). chloride
channel myotonias include the dominant myotonia
congenita of thomsen and the recessive generalized
myotonia of becker, while sodium channel myotonias
include paramyotonia congenita (pmc) and potassiumaggravated myotonias (pam) both with autosomal
dominant inheritance patterns. although clinically
distinguishable by the nature of exacerbating factors,

all these disorders share a similar phenotype and
medication. the sodium channel blocker mexiletine is
widely considered as the drug of choice to treat myotonic
syndromes (moxley, 2000). the rationale for the use of
mexiletine is that this drug produces a use-dependent
block of sodium channels, that is the higher the frequency
of sarcolemma depolarization, the greater is the blocking
action, which allows a selective action of the drug on
myotonic discharges of action potentials. yet, regarding
the sodium channel myotonias, the mutations themselves
can modify the sensitivity of the channel to mexiletine
(fan et al. 1996; fleischhauer et al. 1998; weckbecker
et al. 2000; desaphy et al. 2001; takahashi & cannon,
2001). these modifications may result from altered
intrinsic affinity or from mutation-induced altered
gating. for instance, since mexiletine binds inactivated

sodium channels with much higher affinity than closed
or open channels, a few myotonic mutations that
shift the voltage dependence of channel inactivation
toward more negative potentials with respect to
wild-type
channels
increase
mutant
channel
responsiveness to mexiletine, whereas most of the
myotonic mutations decrease the proportion of
inactivated channels at the resting potential (rightward
shift of channel availability voltage dependence) and
consequently reduce mutant channel block by the drug
(desaphy et al. 2001). thus individual myotonic patients
should benefit from drugs acting more specifically on
mutant channels with respect to wild-type sodium
channels (griggs & ptá xxxg791xxx , 1999).
interestingly, the antiarrhythmic drug  xxxd2113xxx  was
shown to improve muscle stiffness in patients with sodium
channel myotonia and shorten q–t intervals in patients
with long-qt3 syndrome, an inherited life-threatening
arrhythmia due to mutations in the cardiac sodium
channel, in situations where mexiletine was less efficient
(rosenfeld et al. 1997; wang et al. 1999; benhorin et al.
2000; abriel et al. 2000). whereas mexiletine is a class
ib antiarrhythmic drug,  xxxd2113xxx  is considered as a
paradigm for class ic antiarrhythmics. both drugs have
similar pk a (more than 95% of the drugs are protonated at
physiological ph), but mexiletine binds to the inactivated
channel from the intracellular side, whereas  xxxd2113xxx 
is referred to as an open-channel blocker and may
reach its binding site from the extracellular side of the
membrane, at least in cardiac na+ channels (nitta et al.
1992; ragsdale et al. 1996; grant et al. 2000; nagatomo
et al. 2000). thus drug-specific molecular blocking
mechanisms may influence individual patient response to
antimyotonic therapy. yet, nothing is known about the
mechanism of block of skeletal muscle sodium channels by
 xxxd2113xxx .
in the current study, we investigated the effects of
 xxxd2113xxx  on myotonic and wild-type human skeletal
muscle sodium (hnav 1.4) channels transiently expressed
in tsa201 cells. we found that  xxxd2113xxx  binds inactivated
sodium channels with high affinity, as compared to closed
channels. this process does not require channel opening,
since voltage-dependent block develops at potentials more
negative than the activation threshold. using the model
of modulated receptor, we show that the molecular
mechanism of  xxxd2113xxx  block is quite similar to that
of mexiletine. yet, there may be two main advantages in
using  xxxd2113xxx  against myotonic syndromes. first, usedependent block develops at lower frequency as compared
to mexiletine, which may offer a greater benefit in all
myotonic syndromes, independently of the genetic origin.

j physiol 554.2 pp 321–334

second,  xxxd2113xxx  block is less dependent on voltagedependent channel availability as compared to mexiletine,
owing to the smaller difference between affinities for
the closed and the inactivated channels (desaphy et al.
2001). thus, for those mutations that produce a positive
shift in the voltage dependence of sodium channel
availability, the difference in  xxxd2113xxx  block between
mutant and wt channels is less with respect to mexiletine
block, and the patients carrying these mutations may
respond better to  xxxd2113xxx  therapy. overall, this study
provides a framework for developing a pharmacogenetic
therapy against sodium channel myotonias to address
with enhanced specificity and efficiency the treatment in
individual myotonic patients.
methods
full-length mutant hnav 1.4 constructs were subcloned
in the mammalian expression vector prc/cmv as
previously described (yang et al. 1994). the tsa201
cells were cotransfected with 10 µg of plasmid dna
encoding the channels and lower amount of plasmid dna
encoding cd8 receptors, using the calcium phosphate
coprecipitation method (desaphy et al. 2001). for
patch clamp recordings (36–72 h after transfection),
successfully transfected cells were identified using dynal
microbeads coated with anti-cd8 antibody (dynal a.s.,
oslo, norway).
whole-cell sodium currents (i na ) were recorded at room
temperature (20–22◦ c) using an axopatch 1d amplifier
(axon instruments, union city, ca, usa). voltage
clamp protocols and data acquisition were performed
with pclamp 6.0 software (axon instruments) through
a 12-bit a–d/d–a interface (digidata 1200, axon
instruments). the external solution contained (mm): 150
nacl, 4 kcl, 2 cacl2 , 1 mgcl2 , 5 hepes and 5 glucose, and
the ph was set to 7.4 with naoh. the pipette solution
contained (mm): 120 csf, 10 cscl, 10 nacl, 5 egta and
5 hepes, and the ph was set to 7.2 with csoh. with such
solutions, pipettes made with corning 7052 glass (garner
glass, claremont, ca, usa) had resistance ranged from 1
to 2 m. currents were low-pass filtered at 2 khz (–3 db)
by the four pole bessel filter of the amplifier and digitized
 xxxd1891xxx –20 khz.
after rupturing the patch membrane, a 25 ms-long test
pulse to –20 mv from a holding potential of –120 mv was
applied to the cell at a low frequency until stabilization of
i na amplitude and kinetics was achieved (typically 5 min).
data were considered for analysis only from cells exhibiting
peak current amplitudes of 0.6–6 na and series resistance
errors <5 mv. little (<5%) or no rundown was observed
within the experiments. specific voltage protocols

effect of  xxxd2113xxx  on wt and myotonic skeletal muscle na+ channels

and analysis procedures are described in the results
section.
 xxxd2113xxx  acetate was purchased from sigma
(milan, italy). qx-314 was a gift from alomone
laboratories (jerusalem, israel). the r(–)-enantiomer of
mexiletine was kindly provided by professor v. tortorella
(department of medicinal chemistry, university of bari,
bari, italy). the patched cell was continuously exposed
to a stream of external solution flowing out of a plastic
capillary. for extracellular application of  xxxd2113xxx , the
superfusing external solution was supplemented with the
drug at final concentration. for intracellular application,
 xxxd2113xxx , qx-314 and mexiletine were dissolved in
pipette solution at final concentration.
average data are presented as means ± s.e.m. and
statistical difference between the means was evaluated

using student’s unpaired t test, with p < 0.05 considered
as significant.

results
different sensitivity of wt and mutant sodium
channels to  xxxd2113xxx 

we have shown previously that paramyotonia congenita
r1448c mutant channels and potassium-aggravated
myotonia g1306e mutant channels are, respectively, more
and less sensitive to mexiletine as compared to wildtype channels (desaphy et al. 2001). to allow direct
comparison, block of sodium channels by  xxxd2113xxx  was
evaluated by measuring the reduction of i na elicited from

figure 1. frequency-dependent  xxxd2113xxx  block of wild-type and mutant hnav1.4 channels at a holding
potential of –120 mv
a, block of sodium currents by  xxxd2113xxx  was assessed 3 min after drug application by measuring the reduction
of ina elicited from –120 to –30 mv at stimulation frequencies of 0.1 hz and 10 hz. b, concentration–response
curves for  xxxd2113xxx  block were constructed at 0.1 hz using the protocol described in a and fitted with eqn (1)
(see results). each data point is the mean ± s.e.m. of at least 3 cells. the calculated ic50 values ± s.e. of the fit were
83.5 ± 16.9 µm for wt, 82.8 ± 11.2 µm for g1306e, and 21.4 ± 2.2 µm for r1448c. c, concentration–response
curves for  xxxd2113xxx  block were constructed  xxxd1891xxx  hz using the protocol described in a and fitted with eqn (1) (see
results). each data point is the mean ± s.e.m. of at least 3 cells. the calculated ic50 values ± s.e. of the fit were
36.6 ± 6.1 µm for wt, 38.2 ± 1.8 µm for g1306e, and 8.2 ± 0.4 µm for r1448c.

the holding potential (hp) of –120 mv to –30 mv at
0.1 hz and 10 hz. applying this protocol in the absence of
drug, there was no significant change (<5%) in current
amplitude for wt or mutant channels (not shown).
figure. 1a illustrates examples of current traces recorded
before (control) and at the steady-state of  xxxd2113xxx  block,
i.e. 3 min after drug application at 0.1 hz and then between
the 100th and 110th pulse  xxxd1891xxx  hz. for both wt and
g1306e channels, 100 µm  xxxd2113xxx  reduced peak i na
by ∼60% at 0.1 hz and by ∼80%  xxxd1891xxx  hz. in contrast,
30 µm  xxxd2113xxx  was sufficient to obtain a similar block of
r1448c peak i na as compared to wt. the concentration–
response curves were fitted with a first-order binding
function,
idrug /icontrol = 1/{1 + ([drug]/ic50 )}

(1)

where ic50 (µm) is the half-maximum inhibitory
concentration. at 0.1 hz, the ic50 values calculated at the
hp of –120 mv were 83.5 µm for wt channels, 82.8 µm
for g1306e mutants, and 21.4 µm for r1448c mutants
(fig. 1b).  xxxd1891xxx  hz, the ic50 values were 36.6 µm, 38.2 µm,
and 8.2 µm, respectively.
closed state-dependent affinity of wt and mutant
sodium channels for  xxxd2113xxx 

for an inactivated-channel blocker (e.g. mexiletine),
apparent affinity measured at the hp of –120 mv
reflected the combination of binding to resting (closed)
and inactivated sodium channels (wright et al. 1997;
desaphy et al. 2001). indeed, a mutant channel (such
as r1448c) showing greater inactivation at –120 mv is
more sensitive to mexiletine than wt channels, whereas a
mutation (such as g1306e) reducing inactivation at this
potential is less sensitive. although  xxxd2113xxx  is generally
reported as an open-channel blocker (ragsdale et al.
1996; grant et al. 2000), recent studies described binding
of the drug to inactivated channels (viswanathan et al.
2001; liu et al. 2002, 2003). thus to look at  xxxd2113xxx 
binding affinity for resting sodium channels (k r ), we
first measured block of wt and r1448c channels while
maintaining the cell hyperpolarized at the hp of –180 mv
for 180 s (prepulse) and, only after that, the cell was
depolarized at 0.1 hz frequency (fig. 2a and b). at
this holding potential, the entire population of wt and
mutant channels should be in the closed state, ready to
open in response to depolarization. in the presence of
100 µm  xxxd2113xxx , only ∼17% of r1448c i na reduction
occurred during the prepulse at –180 mv, and this effect
was quite similar for wt channels (fig. 2c). the block
further developed during stimulation at 0.1 hz, revealing

j physiol 554.2 pp 321–334

a large component of use-dependent block that was greater
for r1448c channels as compared to wt (p < 0.05;
fig. 2d). the same drug effect was obtained using a 90
s-long prepulse, while the same protocol had no effect
in the absence of the drug (data not shown), indicating
that neither slow inactivation nor ultra-slow inactivation,
which develop with time constants of ∼10 s and ∼100 s,
was involved in i na reduction (vilin & ruben, 2001;
hilber et al. 2002). altogether, these data suggested that
the i na reduction during the prepulse was due to drug
binding to closed channels and that  xxxd2113xxx  has the
same affinity for closed r1448c and wt channels, while
the difference in sensitivity between these two channels
observed at –180 mv and 0.1 hz was mainly due to
difference in use-dependent block. thus we calculated
the k r value for wt and r1448c sodium channels
as the ic50 value of concentration–response curves for
block occurring during the prepulse (k r ∼480 µm,
fig. 2e).
inactivated state-dependent affinity of wt
and mutant sodium channels for  xxxd2113xxx 

to verify whether  xxxd2113xxx  binds to sodium channels in
the inactivated state, we repeated the same protocol as in
fig. 2a using various holding potentials more negative
than the activation threshold. for wt channels, changing
the hp from –180 to –120 mv produced no change in
i na block, whereas tonic block was significantly greater
at –90 mv (fig. 2c and d). for r1448c channels, the
extent of block was already significantly enhanced when
depolarizing the cell to –120 mv. these results indicate
that  xxxd2113xxx  can bind to inactivated skeletal muscle
channels without channel opening, i.e. through closedstate inactivation. since there is no difference in slow
inactivation between wt and r1448c channels (hayward
et al. 1999), the difference between the two channels in drug
sensitivity observed at –120 and –90 mv is not imputable
to slow inactivation. also, it was not due to ultra-slow
inactivation because we observed no difference between
90 s and 180 s prepulses (not shown). thus the difference
in drug sensitivity between the two channels observed
at these potentials may result from difference in voltage
dependence of fast inactivation.
in a previous study, we obtained a quite good estimate
of the binding affinity constant to fast inactivated channels
(k i ) for clenbuterol by measuring the shift of steady-state
availability curves induced by the drug (bean et al. 1983;
desaphy et al. 2003). thus we repeated this protocol
for both r1448c and wt channels in the presence of
various concentrations of  xxxd2113xxx . the steady-state

the hp of –180 mv and depolarized to –30 mv at 0.1 hz frequency, except under the open bar where the hp was
maintained with no depolarization for determination of tonic block (itb ). the filled bars indicate application of 100
µm  xxxd2113xxx . b, traces of r1448c ina measured at the times indicated by arrows in a. ictrl was measured just
before application of the drug, while i0.1 was measured when steady-state block was reached at 0.1 hz stimulation
frequency. c and d, tonic block is expressed as 100 × (ictrl – itb )/ictrl , while use-dependent block is expressed as
100 × (itb – i0.1 )/ictrl , measured as in a with hp = –180, –120 and –90 mv. each bar corresponds to the mean
± s.e.m. of at least 4 cells. the p-values reported on bars were calculated using student’s unpaired t test versus
respective block at hp = –180 mv. in addition, use-dependent block of r1448c channels was significantly greater
than that of wt channels (at least p < 0.02). e, concentration–response curves were constructed for itb /ictrl
measured as in a at hp = –180 mv and fitted with eqn (1). each data point is the mean ± s.e.m. of at least 4 cells.
the calculated ic50 values ± s.e. of the fit were 469.0 ± 31.8 µm for wt and 481.2 ± 21.4 µm for r1448c.

availability relationships were fitted with a boltzmann
equation,
ina /{ina,max = 1/{1 + exp[(v − v1/2 )/s]}

(2)

where v 1/2 (mv) is the half-maximum inactivation
potential and s (mv) is the slope factor. as already
described, inactivation of r1448c i na occurred at ∼10mv more negative potentials and s was lower as compared
to wt i na (desaphy et al. 2001). in the presence of
 xxxd2113xxx , the availability curves of both channels were
negatively shifted in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3a
and b). nevertheless the drug did not change the steepness
factor of each channel, as expected from the modulated
receptor model that forecasts a strong 1 : 1 binding
to the inactivated channel with respect to binding to
the closed channel (hille, 1977; bean et al. 1983). the
half-maximum inactivation potential was reported as a
function of  xxxd2113xxx  concentration, and the relationships
were fitted with the equation
v1/2 = v1/2,ctrl + sctrl ln{1/(1 + ([drug]/k i ))} (3)
where sctrl and v 1/2,ctrl were the mean values of s and
v 1/2 measured in control conditions (bean et al. 1983; fan
et al. 1996; desaphy et al. 2003). although the shift was
greater for r1448c channels, the k i value was quite similar
for mutant and wt channels (k i = 18 µm). indeed, the
shift difference between the wt and r1448c channels was
related to the different slope factors of availability curves
between the two channels (see equation parameters of the
fits in fig. 3).
recovery from inactivation and from  xxxd2113xxx  block

it should be noted that interpulse intervals in the
availability protocol must be at least 30 s long to prevent
accumulation of  xxxd2113xxx  block and consequent overestimation of the drug-induced shift (fig. 3a). this is
consistent with the development of use-dependent block
we observed at 0.1 hz frequency stimulation (see fig. 2).
to estimate more accurately recovery time from  xxxd2113xxx 
block, we included a recovery pulse of increasing duration
at –180 mv between two test pulses at –30 mv (fig. 3c and
d). the amplitude of i na elicited by the second test pulse
was normalized with respect to amplitude of first pulse
i na and reported as a function of recovery pulse duration.
the relationships were best fitted with a biexponential
function:
i (t) = a0 + a1 (1 − exp(−t/tau1 )) + a2 (1 − exp(−t/tau2 ))
(4)

j physiol 554.2 pp 321–334

where a1 and a2 are the relative contributions of the
exponential time constants tau 1 (ms) and tau 2 (ms). the term
a0 was introduced in eqn (4) to take into consideration
the delay before recovery from inactivation that has been
reported by others (kuo & bean, 1994; groome et al.
1999). in drug-free condition, a 0.5 ms-long conditioning
pulse allowed ∼50% of wt channels to recover from fast
inactivation and full recovery was reached in ∼30 ms
(fig. 3c). in previous studies, several mutations at position
1448 were shown to accelerate recovery from inactivation,
but this effect was less significant at hyperpolarized voltage
(fan et al. 1996; ji et al. 1996; bendahhou et al. 1999;
groome et al. 1999; weckbecker et al. 2000). accordingly,
we found little difference in recovery from inactivation
between r1448c and wt channels at –180 mv (table 1).
in the presence of  xxxd2113xxx , the time course of the fast
component was similar to that observed without drug,
and the relationships were fitted with eqn (4) using
the tau 1 value obtained in control conditions. for wt
channels,  xxxd2113xxx  increased a2 from ∼10% to ∼15%
and drastically slowed tau 2 from ∼7 ms to ∼3 s (table 1).
for r1448c channels, the effect of  xxxd2113xxx  on a2 was
similar, but the effect on tau 2 was more pronounced (from
∼6 ms to ∼16 s). it is clear from fig. 3 that an interval
duration of 10 s (0.1 hz) between two depolarizing pulses
allowed fewer r1448c channels to recover from  xxxd2113xxx 
block as compared to wt, thereby explaining the greater
use-dependent block of r1448c channels shown in fig. 2.
effect of  xxxd2113xxx  on sodium current decay

since the slowing of i na decay rate is a common
feature of myotonia-causing mutations, such a defect was
proposed as a determinant of myotonic attacks (yang et al.
1994). counteracting this biophysical defect may therefore
constitute a specific approach against myotonia. in fig. 4,
the superposition of control and  xxxd2113xxx -modified i na
of r1448c channels, as well as the drug-modified i na
normalized with respect to control peak i na (dashed line),
indicates that the drug was able to accelerate current decay.
to quantify such an effect, the current decays of wt
and r1448c channels in control and in the presence of
100 µm  xxxd2113xxx  were fitted with a biexponential function
including a residual current (r),
i (t) = pexp(−t/tau d1 ) + qexp(−t/tau d2 ) + r

(5)

such an equation allowed an excellent fit to experimental
data in >90% of the cells; the other <10% of cells
were discarded from analysis. as previously shown
(desaphy et al. 2001), the r1448c mutation significantly
prolonged both tau d 1 and tau d 2 , and drastically increased
the contribution of tau d 2 (term q in eqn (5)) to total current

from –150 to –30 mv in 10 mv increments. pulses were delivered  xxxd1891xxx  s or 30 s interval duration (id) as indicated
and hp was –180 mv. the peak ina recorded during the test pulse was plotted against the conditioning pulse

17.1 ± 1.1 µm for wt (v 1/2,ctrl was –75.7 mv and sctrl was 5.8 mv in eqn (3)) and 17.8 ± 2.9 µm for r1448c
channels (v 1/2,ctrl was –85.0 mv and sctrl was 11.1 mv). c and d, the recovery of wt and r1448c channels
from inactivation and from  xxxd2113xxx  block was measured at –180 mv. a recovery pulse at the hp of increasing
duration was included between two test pulses at –30 mv. the peak ina recorded during the second test pulse was
normalized with respect to the peak ina recorded during the first test pulse and means ± s.e.m. were calculated
from at least 5 cells to be plotted against the recovery time. the relationships were fitted with eqn (4) (see results).

the values of dissociation constants for closed channels (k r ) and inactivated channels (k i ) were calculated experimentally in the
present study for  xxxd2113xxx  and a previous study for mexiletine (desaphy et al. 2001). each drug showed the same state-specific
affinities to all the three channels. the half-maximum inactivation potential (v 1/2 ) and the slope factor (s) were determined from the
fit of steady-state availability curves specific to each channel and are given along with the s.e. of the fit. the proportion of closed
channels (h) at a holding potential (hp) of –120 mv is given as mean ± s.e.m. from 17–33 cells. the theoretical apparent affinities k app

from dose–response curves obtained experimentally at the hp of –120 mv (see fig. 6).

decay (fig. 4). in the presence of  xxxd2113xxx , the acceleration
of current decay was attributable mainly to a reduction of
q with respect to p, whereas r and both time constants
remained unchanged (fig. 4). the two time constants may
be the macroscopic manifestation of channels gating in
two inactivating modes, named m1 and m2 (zhou et al.
1991). the m2 gating mode is largely repressed in wildtype channels expressed in mammalian cells, whereas it is
exacerbated by myotonic mutations (moran et al. 1999).
the reduction of q by  xxxd2113xxx  therefore suggests that
the drug may stabilize mutant channels in the m1 gating
mode or may preferentially block m2 gating channels.
access route of  xxxd2113xxx  to its molecular binding site

it is generally proposed that charged class i antiarrhythmic
drugs reach their binding site from the intracellular side of
the channel pore, but that cardiac sodium channels present
also an external access path for membrane-impermeant
quaternary amine local anaesthetics, which is not found
in skeletal muscle and neuronal sodium channels (frazier
et al. 1970; qu et al. 1995). by assessing use-dependent
block in the presence of intracellular  xxxd2113xxx , two studies
performed on native and heterologously expressed cardiac

channels have proposed that  xxxd2113xxx  may reach its
binding site from an extracellular route (nitta et al. 1992;
grant et al. 2000). to test this hypothesis in the skeletal
muscle sodium channel,  xxxd2113xxx  was included in the
micropipette solution and, 5–10 min after achieving the
whole-cell configuration, test pulses from –120 to –30 mv
were applied  xxxd1891xxx  hz stimulation frequency to assess usedependent block (fig. 5). in drug-free conditions, such
protocol produced less than 5% current reduction. with
300 µm qx-314 in the pipette, a membrane-impermeant
quaternary lidocaine analogue, use-dependent block of i na
developed to ∼50% of control. with 100 µm  xxxd2113xxx ,
use-dependent block was only ∼8% of control i na (not
shown). adding 1 mm  xxxd2113xxx  to the pipette solution,
use-dependent block reached ∼15% of control i na and was
similar to that produced by 1 mm mexiletine (fig. 5). this
result suggests that  xxxd2113xxx  can reach its binding site
from the intracellular side. the reduced use-dependent
block by internally applied, membrane-permeant drugs
as compared to that obtained with external application
of the same drugs is most probably due to the diffusion
of the internally applied drug out of the cell because
of the large difference in volume between the internal
and external cell compartments. accordingly, pronounced

effect of  xxxd2113xxx  on wt and myotonic skeletal muscle na+ channels

use-dependent block was observed with internal
application of a membrane-impermeant, quaternary
analogue of  xxxd2113xxx  in a recent study performed on
cardiac channels (liu et al. 2003).

simulation of  xxxd2113xxx  block according to the
modulated receptor hypothesis

we performed simulations to test whether the modulated
receptor hypothesis may account for the voltage
dependence of  xxxd2113xxx  block (hille, 1977). using the k r
and k i values for mexiletine and  xxxd2113xxx  we determined
in previous and the present studies, we applied the
modulated receptor hypothesis to block of wt, g1306e,

and r1448c channels, using the equation
1/k app = h/k r + (1 − h)/k i

(6)

where k app is the apparent affinity constant at the potential
considered and the terms h and (1 – h) are the proportions
of closed and inactivated channels at this potential, as
determined from steady-state availability curves (bean
et al. 1983). the ic50 values for tonic block obtained
experimentally at the hp of –120 mv for both mexiletine
and  xxxd2113xxx  are quite similar to the theoretical values of
k app calculated with eqn (6) (table 2). the experimental
and theoretical dose–response relationships are compared
in fig. 6. the model confirms that changing the hp from
–180 to –120 mv has little effect on  xxxd2113xxx  block of wt
and g1306e channels but a pronounced effect on r1448c

channel blockade (fig. 6a and c). conversely, because the
affinity of mexiletine for inactivated channels was stronger
(lower k i value), depolarizing the membrane to the hp
of –120 mv has a marked effect also on wt channel
blockade by mexiletine, in accord with the experimental
data (fig. 6b and d).
discussion
molecular mechanism of  xxxd2113xxx  block

 xxxd2113xxx  is a sodium channel blocker that has been
studied in various animal models of arrhythmia and used
against ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmia
in patients without structural heart disease (american
heart association, 2000). because of its potent inhibition
of cardiac sodium channels and slow recovery kinetics,
 xxxd2113xxx  has been included in the class ic of
antiarrhythmic drugs (vaughan williams, 1984). the
molecular mechanism of  xxxd2113xxx  block has been
addressed on cardiac and neuronal sodium channels, but
little is known about drug interaction with skeletal muscle
sodium channels. based on voltage dependence and
kinetic analysis of whole-cell and single-channel current
block of cardiac and brain sodium channels,  xxxd2113xxx 
is widely considered as an open channel blocker (anno

were held at –120 mv and received a 25 ms-long depolarizing pulse to
–30 mv every 0.1 s (10 hz) to elicit ina . this protocol was applied
about 5 min after achieving the whole-cell configuration to allow
pipette solution to diffuse well within the cell. peak ina measured at
each test pulse was normalized with respect to the first pulse ina . each
data point is the mean from at least 3 cells.

& hondeghem, 1990; nitta et al. 1992; ragsdale et al.
1996; nagatomo et al. 2000; grant et al. 2000). however,
such a view has been recently challenged by two studies
using cardiac sodium channel mutants responsible for
 xxxg2028xxx  and brugada syndromes (viswanathan et al. 2001;
liu et al. 2002). both studies concluded that  xxxd2113xxx 
binds to inactivated states of the cardiac channels. yet, one
proposed that  xxxd2113xxx  block occurs through closed-state
inactivation that develops below the resting membrane
potential, whereas the other retained the view that
 xxxd2113xxx  block requires channel opening.
our study clearly demonstrates that closed-state
inactivation is a determinant of  xxxd2113xxx  block in cells
expressing wild-type and mutant hnav1.4 channels. for
wt channels, the extent of block was dependent on
holding voltage below the activation threshold, being
greater at –90 mv as compared to –120 and –180 mv.
this behaviour was further exacerbated by the r1448c
mutation that produces a negative shift in channel steadystate fast inactivation voltage dependence. these effects, as
well as the differences between mexiletine and  xxxd2113xxx 
in voltage dependence of sodium channel blockade, were
fully explained by the modulated receptor hypothesis that
predicts the preferential binding of  xxxd2113xxx  to inactivated
channels as compared to closed channels. thus  xxxd2113xxx 
can be considered as an inactivated-channel blocker of
human skeletal muscle sodium channels.
importantly,  xxxd2113xxx  block developed at potentials
that did not allow channels to open. we also verified that
recovery of wt and r1448c channels from  xxxd2113xxx 
block does not require channel opening, since sodium
current recovered control amplitude on return to drugfree solution in the absence of depolarization (not shown).
thus  xxxd2113xxx  can access and leave its binding site without
channel opening, although we cannot exclude that channel
opening may favour transit of charged drug as previously
suggested for the cardiac channel (liu et al. 2003). without
single-channel recordings, it is hazardous to definitely
exclude open-channel blockade by  xxxd2113xxx . however,
 xxxd2113xxx  did not modify the two decay time constants
that describe the decay of wt and r1448c currents.
this suggests that the channel mean open times were
not modified by the drug, arguing against open channel
blockade.
the mechanism of  xxxd2113xxx  block we described on
skeletal muscle sodium channels, including the internal
access path toward the binding site, is in contrast with many
of the studies performed with the cardiac sodium channels.
the mechanistic basis that governs the differences in drug
affinity between the two channel isoforms is still debated.
some studies proposed that it depends on differences in

effect of  xxxd2113xxx  on wt and myotonic skeletal muscle na+ channels

channel gating that secondarily alter drug effect (wright
et al. 1997; nuss et al. 2000), whereas others proposed that
it depends on structural differences in the drug receptor
site or access (nuss et al. 1995; wang et al. 1996; weiser
et al. 1999). elucidation of the mechanisms that account for
the differences in  xxxd2113xxx  block would require the direct
comparison of drug effect between the two channels and
is beyond the scope of this paper.

effect of r1448c mutation on recovery from
 xxxd2113xxx  block

recovery from  xxxd2113xxx  block was assessed at –180 mv in
an attempt to minimize any bias introduced by mutationinduced changes in inactivation voltage dependence.
interestingly, the time constant corresponding to recovery
from  xxxd2113xxx  block was larger for r1448c as compared

as described in fig. 2. each data point is the mean ± s.e.m. of at least 3 cells. the relationships were fitted with
eqn (1) (see results) and the ic50 values are reported in table 2. c and d, the theoretical curves according to
the modulated receptor hypothesis were built using eqn (1) (see results) with the k app values calculated for wt,

k r and k i were obtained using k r and k i values reported in table 2 for each drug and describe the theoretical
relationships for a hypothetical pure block of closed channels (k r ) and a hypothetical pure block of inactivated
channels (k i ).

to wt channels, which provides a rationale for increased
use-dependent block of r1448c i na . a similar effect
of mexiletine was described on r1448h channels
(weckbecker et al. 2000). the arginine at position 1448
is the outermost charged residue of the voltage sensor
within domain iv and contributes approximately 2/3 of
the gating charge of the s4 segment (sheets & hanck,
1999). immobilization of s4 segments of domains iii
and iv in an outward position have been associated
with the slow time course of recovery from inactivation,
and binding of lidocaine to cardiac sodium channels has
been shown to stabilize the gating charges of these two
segments in the depolarized conformation (cha et al. 1999;
sheets & hanck, 2003). accordingly, our results suggest
that neutralization of the main gating charge in div-s4
through the r1448c mutation enhances voltage sensor
immobilization by  xxxd2113xxx , thereby slowing the recovery
time constant.
therapeutic interest of  xxxd2113xxx  in myotonic
syndromes

use of  xxxd2113xxx  has appeared valuable in sodium
channelopathies of heart and skeletal muscle where
mexiletine was less efficient (rosenfeld et al. 1997;
benhorin et al. 2000; abriel et al. 2000). in the heart, such
improvement may result from the different mechanisms
of action of the two drugs on cardiac sodium channels
(nagatomo et al. 2000). in the skeletal muscle, molecular
mechanisms of  xxxd2113xxx  block are quite similar to those
of mexiletine, and gating changes induced by myotonic
mutations may account for the different drug sensitivities
of encoded channels (desaphy et al. 2001). although some
mutations may also affect more directly the binding site or
the access path of the drugs (fan et al. 1996; takahashi &
cannon, 2001), we believe that, as for mexiletine, voltage
dependence of channel availability may be considered
as a general index of mutant channel responsiveness to
 xxxd2113xxx  therapy.
there may be two main motivations in using  xxxd2113xxx 
instead of mexiletine in myotonic syndromes. first,
 xxxd2113xxx  use-dependent block develops at frequencies
lower than those required by mexiletine, which may help
to prevent the development of myotonic runs of action
potentials. such mechanism should apply to all forms of
myotonia, independently of the genetic origin. second,
for those mutations such as g1306e that produce a
positive shift in sodium channel availability,  xxxd2113xxx 
may target more efficiently the mutated channel as
compared to mexiletine. indeed, we previously proposed
that mexiletine most probably exerts its beneficial

j physiol 554.2 pp 321–334

effect by blocking preferentially wt channels in the
heterozygous patients carrying these mutations (desaphy
et al. 2001). since  xxxd2113xxx  block is less dependent
on voltage-dependent channel availability, owing to a
smaller difference between k i and k r , the difference
in  xxxd2113xxx  block between mutant and wt channels
is less as compared with mexiletine block. moreover
 xxxd2113xxx  is able to accelerate i na decay rate of myotonic
mutants, which may represent a specific therapeutic
approach toward sodium channel myotonias. thus,
 xxxd2113xxx  appears to be a good candidate to improve
the antimyotonic therapy in sodium channelopathies. for
instance, carriers of the v445m mutation that suffer from
painful myotonia are resistant to mexiletine and  xxxd3387xxx 
therapy, but respond dramatically to  xxxd2113xxx  (rosenfeld
et al. 1997).
in conclusion, our findings provide a general framework
for developing a pharmacogenetic therapy against sodium
channel myotonia.  xxxd2113xxx  and mexiletine exhibit the
same mechanism of block of skeletal muscle sodium
channels, but  xxxd2113xxx  blocks some mutant channels
more efficiently than mexiletine. the choice of the drug
can be addressed on the basis of gating defects induced by
the mutation, especially the specific voltage dependence of
channel availability.
