abstract. spironolacotone
and
 xxxd2010xxx 
are
mineralocorticoid-blocking agents used for their ability to block both the epithelial and non-epithelial actions
of aldosterone. spironolactone is a non-selective  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist with moderate affinity
for both progesterone and androgen receptors. the latter
property increases the likelihood of endocrine side effects
with spironolactone including loss of libido, menstrual irregularities, gynecomastia and impotence.  xxxd2010xxx  is a
next generation  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist selective
for aldosterone receptors alone. this lesser affinity for
progesterone and androgen receptors was arrived at by
replacing the 17-alpha-thioacetyl group of spironolactone with
a carbomethoxy group.  xxxd2010xxx  is further distinguished
from spironolactone by its shorter half-life and the fact that
it does not have any active metabolites. both  xxxd2010xxx 
and spironolactone are effective antihypertensive agents
and each has been shown to improve the morbidity and
mortality of heart failure.  xxxd2010xxx  or spironolactone
use can increase serum potassium values and occasionally
results in clinically relevant hyperkalemia. this is more apt
to occur with spironolactone due to the very long half-life
of several of its active metabolites.

introduction
aldosterone is classified as a mineralocorticoid
hormone based on its potent effects on sodium
(na+ ) retention and potassium (k+ ) excretion.
this occurs mainly at the renal tubular level and
to a lesser extent at other epithelial sites such as
the salivary glands and the gastrointestinal tract.
these effects on vectorial na+ /k+ exchange are
termed classical or “epithelial” and are mediated
via the binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid (type 1 glucocorticoid) receptor, interaction of
the ligand-receptor complex with dna and an adjustment in gene expression. recent evidence suggests that aldosterone also has a variety of “nonepithelial” effects, which was deduced with the
discovery of mineralocorticoid receptors in mul-

tiple non-epithelial locations. the non-epithelial
effects of aldosterone appear to be mediated by a
second messenger system, which involves activation of the na+ /h+ transporter [1,2].
aldosterone-receptor antagonists (aras)—
such as spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx —limit
both the epithelial and non-epithelial responses to
aldosterone [2]. these compounds are commonly
employed in the management of hypertension
with or without primary hyperaldosteronism, and
in the volume-overload phases of heart failure
(hf), cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome [3–5].
in this regard, the pertinent site of action for
these compounds resides in the distal nephron.
more recently, the identification of aldosterone
receptors in locations such as the heart has
prompted use of this class of agents to control
detrimental cardiac effects of aldosterone, which
are volume-independent. the cardiac benefits
of aldosterone-receptor blockade are now sufficiently well established to justify routine use of
these compounds in advanced stages of hf [6,7].

class considerations
the first compound in a class of medications is
generally well-defined mechanistically but oftentimes ends up being given in a suboptimal dosing form and/or carries with its use burdensome
side-effects; thus, classes of medications generally evolve along the lines of more efficient delivery systems and/or that of increased mechanistic specificity to reduce side-effect rate. the
calcium-channel blocker (ccb) class of medications illustrates how such progression occurs in

the pharmaceutical field. for this medication class
sustained (and/or) delayed-release delivery systems have substantially improved dosing flexibility; moreover, more evolved ccbs, characterized
by reduced side-effect rates, have become available.
in the instance of aras two compounds exist—
spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  (fig. 1). spironolactone was the first diuretic engineered expressly
to block a particular renal transport process involved in sodium (na+ ) handling; structurally,
spironolactone contained elements of the progesterone molecule and as was to be expected, its use
was accompanied by progestogenic and antiandrogenic adverse effects—such as painful gynecomastia and other sexual side effects [8]. mindful of
this lack of specificity for the mineralocorticoid
receptor other more specific compounds—such as
 xxxd2010xxx —were synthesized to reduce the possibility of sexual side-effects; thus, the advancement
in the field of ara therapy [9,10].

pharmacokinetics
spironolactone
spironolactone is poorly soluble in aqueous fluids
and an intravenous formulation is not available
for routine clinical use. the absolute bioavailabilty
of spironolactone has not been determined in man;
however, balance experiments would suggest that
the extent of absorption is in the 80–90% range for
some but not all commercial preparations. food increases the absorption of spironolactone and possibly decreases its first-pass metabolism; however,
administration of spironolactone with food in hypertensive patients results in similar therapeutic
effects as when the drug is given in a fasted state
[11].
spironolactone is both rapidly metabolized hepatically into a number of metabolites as well as
being an inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes in man. until recently, canrenone was thought to be the major metabolite

of spironolactone. this conclusion proved erroneous being based on non-specific fluorometric
assay findings [12,13]. assays of spironolactone
and its metabolites by the use of high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) have established that fluorometrically determined levels
of canrenone overestimate true canrenone levels
[14]. using hplc, the predominant metabolite,
7alpha-methylspironolactone (tms) [15], was found to
account for around 80% of the k+ -sparing effect of
spironolactone. spironolactone (88%) and its canrenone metabolite (99%) are extensively bound to
plasma protein at therapeutic concentrations [16].
in normal volunteers, taking spironolactone
(100-mg/day) for 15 days, the mean half-lives
(t1/2 ) for spironolactone, canrenone, 7alpha-tms and
6ß-hydroxy-7alpha-tms were 1.4, 16.5, 13.8, and 15
hours, respectively. thus, although unmetabolized
spironolactone is present in serum, it is quickly
cleared. spironolactone is used in cirrhotic patients to induce a natriuresis and in heart failure
as a component of two or three-drug diuretic therapy. in cirrhotic patients, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the t1/2 of spironolactone and its
metabolites are increased. the t1/2 for spironolactone, canrenone, 7alpha-tms and 6ß-hydroxy-7alpha-tms
are 9, 58, 24, and 126 hours, respectively [17].
the pharmacokinetics of spironolactone and its
metabolites have not been specifically studied in
the setting of renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease (esrd) [18].
the onset of action for spironolactone is typically very slow, with a peak response sometimes occurring 48 hours or more after the first
dose. this may relate to it taking several days of
spironolactone dosing for its active metabolites to
reach steady-state plasma levels. the natriuretic
effect of spironolactone gradually wanes over a period of 48 to 72 hours. the duration of spironolactone effect may differ relative to natriuresis and
antikaliuresis. the latter has been observed to
persist for several days after discontinuation of
spironolactone.
 xxxd2010xxx 
the critical feature of the  xxxd2010xxx  molecule
conferring selectivity for the  xxxg1602xxx  is the presence of the 9, 11-epoxy in the
lactone ring (fig. 1). in vitro studies have shown
this structural difference to produce an approximate 10–20 fold lower affinity for the  xxxg1602xxx  compared with spironolactone
[9,10] however, in vivo 3 h aldosterone binding to
rat renal mineralocorticoid receptors is 50% inhibited with oral  xxxd2010xxx  (0.8-mg/kg) compared
with a dose of 1.7-mg/kg for spironolactone. the
difference in receptor affinity and potency between
the 2 molecules may be due to the lesser protein
binding (50%) of  xxxd2010xxx .

the most striking distinction between
 xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone lies in their differing affinity for androgen and progestin receptors.
compared with spironolactone  xxxd2010xxx  has
up to a 500-fold lower affinity for these receptors, which may translate into a several-fold
decrease in adverse effects of a progestogenic
and/or antiandrogenic nature.  xxxd2010xxx  is
also 370-fold less potent than spironolactone in
blocking dihydrotestosterone-related activation
of androgen receptors (table 1) [9]. the change in
receptor affinities with  xxxd2010xxx  is attributed
to sterical interference of the receptor fit by the 7
alpha-ester and the 9alpha–11alpha substitutions.
the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd2010xxx  is not
known; however, balance studies have shown that
it is rapidly absorbed from any of a number of intestinal sites including the duodenum, jejunum,
colon, and rectum with a maximum concentration
(cmax ) of 1.3-hrs [19]. there are no known fooddrug interactions with  xxxd2010xxx .  xxxd2010xxx 
is moderately (33–60%) protein bound, primarily to alpha1 -acid glycoprotein. the protein binding of
 xxxd2010xxx  is concentration-dependent within the
expected therapeutic range for this drug; however,
the protein binding 90-minutes post-dose (100-mg)
is 49% and should be the reference value [19]. the
apparent volume of distribution for  xxxd2010xxx 
at steady-state is 43–90 l.  xxxd2010xxx  and its
metabolites do not preferentially partition into red
blood cells [19].
the primary route of elimination for  xxxd2010xxx 
is through cyp450 3a4-mediated metabolism [20].
the apparent plasma clearance of  xxxd2010xxx 
is ≈10l/hr and its elimination half-life is 4 to
6-hrs. no active metabolites have been identified for  xxxd2010xxx . the two major metabolites of
 xxxd2010xxx  in humans,  xxxd1946xxx -oh  xxxd2010xxx  and the
open lactone ring form of  xxxd2010xxx  are both inactive when tested using human mineralocorticoid
receptors. the large majority of  xxxd2010xxx  recovered in urine is as metabolite and not as the intact

25

molecule [21]. as a percentage of dose, the primary
metabolites excreted in urine and feces included
 xxxd1946xxx -hydroxy-ep ( xxxd1946xxx -ohep) (32.0%), 6 beta, 21-ohep
(20.5%), 21-ohep (7.89%), and 2alpha, 3 beta, 21-ohep
(5.96%). the amounts of the other metabolites excreted are less than 5% each [19].
in elderly volunteers (aged ≥ 65-yrs), receiving  xxxd2010xxx  100-mg once daily, cmax and the
area-under-the-curve (auc) for  xxxd2010xxx  are increased by 22 and 45%, respectively, compared
with healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45-yrs [22,23].
such pharmacologic changes in the elderly can
generally be inferred as being due to decreases
in conventional physiologic variables such as
liver volume and/or intrinsic enzyme capacity. at
steady-state, the cmax and auc for  xxxd2010xxx  are
decreased by 19 and 26%, respectively in black
compared with white patients [22]. in patients
with various stages of renal insufficiency, the
greatest increase in cmax and auc for  xxxd2010xxx 
was 24 and 38%, respectively.  xxxd2010xxx  is not removed by hemodialysis. these modifications in the
elimination profile of  xxxd2010xxx  are insufficient to
warrant dosage adjustment based on pharmacokinetic considerations [21]. in patients with childspugh class b hepatic impairment, the cmax and
auc are increased by ≈4 and 42%, respectively.
dose adjustment is not necessary in the elderly
or in patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction as a function of altered pharmacokinetics
[23].
 xxxd2010xxx  should not be administered together with potent inhibitors of the cyp3a4 system, such as ketoconazole (and itraconazole), since
the auc of  xxxd2010xxx  increases 5-fold when it is
coadministered with ketoconazole [24]. less potent inhibitors of the cyp3a4 system such as erythromycin, verapamil, fluconazole, and saquinavir
will increase the auc for  xxxd2010xxx  by a factor of
two [24]. in the case of coadministration of these
compounds, the starting dose of  xxxd2010xxx  should
be reduced from 50 to 25-mg/day.  xxxd2010xxx  itself
does not have an effect on cyp3a4; thus, it will not
interfere with the metabolism of other substrates
for cyp3a4 [25].
pharmacodynamics
when spironolactone was originally developed,
the scientific study of aldosterone was limited to
effects on epithelial ion transport, and even this
knowledge was in its infancy. as a result, spironolactone was initially classified as a k+ -sparing diuretic. although it retains this property this classification is presently obsolete given the growing evidence for aldosterone effect in cardiovascular disease in areas other than ion transport.
thus, the pharmacodynamics of aras consist of
issues of epithelial ion transport, a spectrum of

26

sica et al.

non-epithelial cellular processes, and blood pressure (bp) regulation, which may be influenced by
both epithelial and non-epithelial actions of aras.
the following section will discuss the pharmacodynamic actions of aras including: epithelial
cell transport of na+ /k+ , changes in the balance
state of the renin-angiotensin axis, alterations
in bp, and cardiac/renal end-organ protection.
head-to-head studies comparing spironolactone to
 xxxd2010xxx  as to most of these pharmacodynamic
measures are not available. where such comparison studies exist, they will be described; otherwise,
the dose-response relationships for these pharmacodynamic end-points will be individually characterized.
na+ transport. spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx 
are weak natriuretic agents when given acutely;
however, at least in the case of spironolactone
( xxxd2010xxx  has not been similarly studied) when
given to patients with cirrhosis and ascites or hf
a significant natriuretic response can occur particularly if combined with a loop diuretic [26,27]
although  xxxd2010xxx  has lower in vitro affinity
than spironolactone for the  xxxg1602xxx ,
both compounds display similar in vivo efficacy
in blocking aldosterone mediated changes in the
urinary na+ : k+ ratio. differences between the
in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of
 xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone may be explained
by differing in vivo study conditions and/or a lesser
degree of protein binding for  xxxd2010xxx .
renin-angiotensin-axis. it is well-established
that blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (raas)—such as ace inhibitors or
angiotensin-receptor blockers—prompt upstream
activation of this axis by disrupting the short feedback loop. in addition, blockade of aldosterone

action at distal nephron mineralocorticoid receptors by  xxxd2010xxx  or spironolactone stimulates
renin release and increases aldosterone levels by
interruption of the long feedback loop. thus, a
predictable pharmacodynamic response to mineralocorticoid blockade with  xxxd2010xxx  or spironolactone is a rise in both plasma renin and aldosterone levels. when studied in parallel treatment
groups at a total daily dose of 100-mg  xxxd2010xxx 
elicits smaller changes in raa axis components
than spironolactone, suggesting that on a molecular weight basis  xxxd2010xxx  is 50 to 75% as potent
as spironolactone (table 2) [28].
of note, the rise in aldosterone levels with
chronic mineralocorticoid blockade is absent a
detrimental effect because the mineralocorticoid
receptor is unavailable for activation by aldosterone. rather, the elevation in serum aldosterone in response to mineralocorticoid blockade
is a usable biomarker of in vivo mineralocorticoid blockade. it is important to note that neither spironolactone nor  xxxd2010xxx  inhibit the relevant enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for
aldosterone.
blood pressure. the greatest treatment experience with aras for hypertension is with
spironolactone. spironolactone has been used with
or without a thiazide-type diuretic in the treatment of essential hypertension and more recently
as monotherapy in the setting of resistant hypertension [29–31]. the dose-response relationship
for spironolactone in the treatment of essential
hypertension is such that doses of 200 and 400mg day provide little additional bp reduction beyond that seen with a dose of 100-mg/day [30].
this differs in resistant hypertension where low
doses of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) in addition to conventional therapies can significantly

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mineralocorticoid blocking agents

reduce bp [29]. the maximal hypotensive effect of spironolactone oftentimes requires 3 to 4
weeks to be fully expressed [32] and may persist for 1 to 2-weeks following its discontinuation
[33].
in one clinical trial with  xxxd2010xxx  there was
no significant difference between once- and twicedaily dosing with the exception of 50-mg twice
daily dosing producing a significantly greater reduction in diastolic bp than 100-mg given once
daily (3.4-mmhg additional ↓ [ p = 0.036]). this
study was an important consideration in establishing the recommended dose titration for
 xxxd2010xxx  as 50-mg once daily to be increased to
50-mg twice daily (rather than 100-mg once daily)
if an inadequate bp response was present with
initial dosing (table 2) [28]. in this same study,
the mg-for-mg bp lowering effect of  xxxd2010xxx 
was less that that of spironolactone. the magnitude of the bp reduction with 50-mg of spironolactone twice daily was comparable to that seen
with  xxxd2010xxx  200-mg twice daily (or 400-mg
once daily), and was 1.3–2.0 times greater than
that seen with  xxxd2010xxx  50-mg twice daily (or
100-mg once daily) (table 2) [28].
the mechanism by which aras reduce bp relates to factors beyond simple volume changes. for
example, in a short-term hemodynamic study of
the effects of increasing doses of spironolactone
(25, 50, and 75 mg/day) in a 5 patient cohort of
esrd disease patients (where volume changes
could be removed from the consideration of mechanism) there was an obvious dose-dependent reduction in systemic bp [34]. on a mechanistic
basis it was observed in these studies that
the pressor response to norepinephrine and
angiotensin-ii was reduced suggesting that cardiovascular reactivity was inhibited by this therapy. furthermore, the pattern of response to
spironolactone has been demonstrated to be independent of prevailing plasma aldosterone values
[29,30].
end-organ protection. head-to-head studies comparing end-organ effects of  xxxd2010xxx 
and spironolactone are not available; moreover,
limited information is available, concerning doseresponse relationships for either compound as to
effects on specific cardiac and renal end-points.
for example, a study of the effect of  xxxd2010xxx 
(with or without enalapril) on either regression
of left ventricular mass or reduction in urine
protein excretion force dose-titrated  xxxd2010xxx  to
200-mg/day [35,36]. also, in both the randomized
 xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study [rales] and the
 xxxd2010xxx  post–acute myocardial infarction
heart failure efficacy and survival study
(ephesus) the doses of spironolactone and

27

 xxxd2010xxx  were 25 and 50-mg, respectively
[6,7]. thus, the medication dose needed for
either a peak or a threshold effect has not been
identified in the case of hf or proteinuric renal
disease.
potassium. both  xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone
are associated with a dose-related increase in
serum k+ levels [37,38]. in this regard, it is important to qualify the effect of an ara on serum
k+ based on the pre-therapy serum values. in addition, there are several patient variables, which
govern the incidence of hyperkalemia (definition of
hyperkalemia can be highly variable) with aras
with the level of renal function being the single
most important determinant of risk; thus, patients
with a primary underlying renal disease (and in
particular diabetic renal disease) or conditions
characterized by a high frequency of accompanying renal failure—as is the case in hf—will be
prone to excessive increases in serum k+ values
with ara treatment [39,40].
the pattern of serum k+ change in hf provides
a good basis for understanding the risk benefit
ratio for ara therapy since spironolactone and
 xxxd2010xxx  have emerged as significant adjunctive
hf treatments [6,7]. a long-term study (the randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study [rales]) of
the effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hf, already receiving conventional hf therapy, offers insight into
the incidence of hyperkalemia in such patients
[6]. rales was preceded by a short, dose-finding
study (dose range 12.5–75.0-mg/day) in which hyperkalemia (serum k+ ≥ 5.5-mmol/l) occurred in
13, 20 and 24%, respectively of patients treated
with spironolactone 25, 50 and 75-mg/day [37].
these incidence numbers for hyperkalemia were
an important consideration in selecting a 25.0-mg
spironolactone dose for rales. in rales, the option existed to reduce the dose of spironolactone to
25-mg every other day if serum k+ concentrations
rose into a hyperkalemic range or to increase
the dose to 50-mg daily after 8-weeks in those
patients with signs or symptoms of worsening
hf.
after 1-yr of therapy with 25-mg of spironolactone daily in rales, the median k+ concentration had risen by a statistically significant
0.3-mmol/l. there were 10 and 14 cases of serious
hyperkalemia in the placebo and spironolactonetreatment groups, respectively. importantly, this
study excluded patients with a serum creatinine
level >2.50-mg/dl (221 µmol per liter) and/or a
baseline serum k+ level >5.0-mmol/l. in addition, the long-term use of agents known to interact with spironolactone increased the risk of hyperkalemia. k+ supplements were used by 29% of

28

sica et al.

the patients in the spironolactone group. it should
be emphasized that in clinical practice following
the rales serum creatinine exclusion criteria
of >2.5 mg/dl can still result in life-threatening
hyperkalemia [41,42]. moreover, spironolactone is
now more broadly used without consideration of
the hf class and/or ejection fraction and without optimization of background treatment with
ace inhibitors and beta-blockers [43]. in the recently completed ephesus compared to placebo
the ara  xxxd2010xxx  significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with left ventricular dysfunction and hf in the post-myocardial
infarction setting [7] at 1-yr k+ levels increased
in this study in both the placebo (↑0.2 mmol/l) and
active therapy groups (↑0.3 mmol/l), p < 0.001).
serious hyperkalemia (serum k+ concentration ≥
6.0 mmol/l) was more common in  xxxd2010xxx  than
in placebo-treated patients (5.5 v. 3.9%). twelve
and 3 patients were hospitalized (at the discretion
of the investigator) in the  xxxd2010xxx  and placebo
groups, respectively. it should be noted that in
routine clinical practice hospitalization for hyperkalemia of diverse etiologies remains an arbitrary
process, in part, because the inpatient treatment
of hyperkalemia may not improve on the outcome
achieved with outpatient management of hyperkalemia [44].
in ephesus, the incidence of hyperkalemia
was higher in those patients with a creatinine
clearance (clcreat ) below 50-ml/min ( xxxd2010xxx 
[10.1%]; placebo [5.9%]) [7]. in patients whose
baseline clcreat was greater than 50-ml/min, the
corresponding rates of hyperkalemia were 4.6 and
3.5%, respectively for  xxxd2010xxx  and placebo. of
note, in ephesus  xxxd2010xxx  also reduced the
risk of hypokalemia, which was twice as likely
as the risk of serious hyperkalemia. in additional
placebo-controlled studies with  xxxd2010xxx , 1%
of patients receiving daily dosages of 100 and
200-mg experienced mean serum k+ levels above
5.5-mmol/l, which was an incidence similar to
that of placebo. in the long-term studies increased
serum k+ values were noted in 2.4% of patients
receiving  xxxd2010xxx  50–200 mg/daily, mostly at
the highest dose.

conclusions
the pharmacokinetics of both  xxxd2010xxx  and
spironolactone are important considerations in
the safe and effective use of these aras. spironolactone has a number of active metabolites and a
longer pharmacodynamic effect than is the case for
 xxxd2010xxx . the more prolonged duration of effect
for spironolactone may be the basis for its ability to reduce bp more so than  xxxd2010xxx ; however, in at-risk patients this extended pharmaco-

dynamic effect for spironolactone may also be associated with a greater risk of hyperkalemia than
what is seen with  xxxd2010xxx . whenever, an ara
is in clinical use a health care provider should be
mindful of the effect of these compounds on serum
k+ . the pre-therapy serum k+ qualified by the
level of renal function should dictate the dose and
frequency of dosing for an ara. once therapy is
begun with an ara, monitoring and therapy for
changes in serum k+ should be anticipatory for
