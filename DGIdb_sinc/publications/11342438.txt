hemostasis, thrombosis, and vascular biology

model for a  xxxg752xxx  activation complex on blood platelets:
dimeric conformation of factor xia is essential
david gailani, david ho, mao-fu sun, qiufang cheng, and peter n. walsh

human  xxxg742xxx  ( xxxg742xxx ) is a
plasma  xxxg745xxx  composed of 2
identical 80-kd polypeptides connected
by a disulfide bond. this dimeric structure is unique among blood coagulation
enzymes. the hypothesis was tested that
dimeric conformation is required for normal  xxxg742xxx  function by generating a monomeric version of  xxxg742xxx  ( xxxg742xxx /pka4) and comparing it to wild-type  xxxg742xxx  in assays
requiring  xxxg752xxx  activation by activated
 xxxg742xxx  (fxia).  xxxg742xxx /pka4 was made by replacing the  xxxg742xxx  a4 domain with the a4 domain
from prekallikrein (pk). a dimeric version
of  xxxg742xxx /pka4 ( xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326) was prepared as a control. activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4

and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 activate  xxxg752xxx 
with kinetic parameters similar to those
of fxia. in kaolin-triggered plasma clotting assays containing purified phospholipid,  xxxg742xxx /pka4 and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 have
coagulant activity similar to  xxxg742xxx . the surface of activated platelets is likely to be a
physiologic site for reactions involving
 xxxg742xxx /fxia. in competition binding assays
 xxxg742xxx /pka4,  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326, and  xxxg742xxx  have
similar affinities for activated platelets
(ki ⴝ 12-16 nm). in clotting assays in
which phospholipid is replaced by activated platelets, the dimeric proteins  xxxg742xxx 
and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 promote coagulation similarly; however, monomeric  xxxg742xxx /

pka4 has greatly reduced activity. western immunoblot analysis confirmed that
activated monomeric  xxxg742xxx /pka4 activates
 xxxg752xxx  poorly in the presence of activated platelets. these findings demonstrate the importance of the dimeric
state to  xxxg742xxx  activity and suggest a novel
model for  xxxg752xxx  activation in which
fxia binds to activated platelets by one
chain of the dimer, while binding to
 xxxg752xxx  through the other. (blood. 2001;

introduction
a paradigm in the field of blood coagulation is that the zymogen of
a plasma protease is activated by limited proteolysis on a phospholipid surface, in the presence of a protein cofactor and divalent
cations.1-5 in vivo, appropriate phospholipid surfaces are provided
by activated platelets and cell membranes of damaged tissues.
formation of surface-bound protease-substrate complexes increases the rate of zymogen activation, concentrates procoagulant
reactions to sites of vessel injury, and minimizes spread of
thrombogenic proteases beyond wound sites. an apparent exception to this model is the activation of  xxxg752xxx  by activated factor
xi (fxia). in in vitro coagulation systems, such as the activated
partial thromboplastin time (aptt) assay, activation of  xxxg752xxx  by
fxia requires calcium ions.6-8 however, phospholipids known to
promote activation of  xxxg741xxx  and prothrombin, such as brain
cephalin, have little effect on the reaction.9,10 furthermore, a
candidate protein cofactor to promote surface assembly of a
fxia-based  xxxg752xxx –activating complex has not been identified.
these observations suggest, counterintuitively, that  xxxg752xxx 
activation by fxia proceeds to a significant extent in the fluid
phase of blood.
zymogen factor xi ( xxxg742xxx ) and fxia do bind to activated
platelets in a process that is saturable and reversible and that
requires the protein cofactor high molecular weight kininogen
(hk) and zinc ions.11,12 evidence strongly suggests that the platelet

surface is a physiologic environment for reactions involving  xxxg742xxx .
when bound to activated platelets,  xxxg742xxx  activation by the proteases
thrombin, factor xiia, and fxia is greatly accelerated.13,14 furthermore, prothrombin may substitute for hk as a cofactor for
 xxxg742xxx /fxia binding to platelets,13,15 providing an explanation for the
lack of excessive bleeding in patients congenitally deficient in
hk.16 given these data and the observation that  xxxg752xxx  binds to
activated platelets,17 it is likely that the surface of activated
platelets is a physiologic environment for activation of  xxxg752xxx 
by fxia.
the  xxxg742xxx  polypeptide is composed of an n-terminal noncatalytic
heavy chain and a c-terminal trypsin-like catalytic light chain.18,19
the heavy chain consists of 4 homologous subunits called apple
domains (designated a1 to a4, from the n-terminus),19,20 a feature
 xxxg742xxx  shares with the plasma protease prekallikrein (pk).21,22
mapping studies identified key amino acids in the a2 and a3
domains that are required for normal binding to  xxxg752xxx .23,24
amino acids involved in  xxxg742xxx  binding to activated platelets have
also been localized to the a3 domain.15,25 the putative  xxxg752xxx 
and platelet-binding sites partially overlap, raising a question as to
the mechanism by which fxia would bind simultaneously to its
substrate and a platelet surface.23,26 a unique feature of  xxxg742xxx 
structure may offer a solution to this dilemma. the protein is a
disulfide bond-linked dimer comprised of 2 of the polypeptides

described above.18-20 in this study we describe the preparation and
characterization of a monomeric version of fxia and demonstrate
that fxia must be a dimer to properly promote coagulation in the
presence of activated platelets. the findings suggest a novel model
for a  xxxg752xxx  activation complex on platelets in which one heavy
chain of fxia binds to the platelet, and the other binds to  xxxg752xxx .

materials and methods
preparation and activation of recombinant proteins
expression constructs for wild-type  xxxg742xxx  and for chimeras  xxxg742xxx /pka4 and
 xxxg742xxx /pka3 ( xxxg742xxx  with the a4 or a3 domain, respectively, replaced with the
corresponding domain from pk) have been described.27 a dimeric version
of  xxxg742xxx /pka4 ( xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326) was created by changing cys326 to
glycine, using a chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene,
lajolla, ca).  xxxg742xxx  with cys321 replaced by alanine ( xxxg742xxx -ala321) was
made in a similar manner. proteins were expressed in 293 fibroblasts23,27
and purified from 500-2000 ml serum-free conditioned media by antibody
affinity chromatography.27 proteins were checked for purity by sodium
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and
protein concentration was determined by dye binding assay (biorad,
hercules, ca). proteins were activated by diluting to 100-200 ␮g/ml in 25
mm tris-hcl ph ⫽ 7.4, 100 mm nacl (tbs) containing 5 ␮g/ml human
fxiia, and incubating at 37°c. conversion of the 80-kd zymogen to the 45and 35-kd chains of fxia was followed by reducing sds-page.
plasma proteins
 xxxg742xxx  and hk were purified from human plasma by published methods.28,29
all proteins appear as single bands on gelcode blue (pierce, rockford,
il)–stained gels. specific activity of human  xxxg742xxx  (230 u/mg) was determined by aptt assay, using  xxxg742xxx -deficient plasma as substrate and pooled
normal plasma as standard (1 u  xxxg742xxx  activity/ml plasma).30 human plasmas
were from george king biomed (overland park, ks). for competition
binding assays, human  xxxg742xxx  was labeled with 125i by a modification of the
iodigen method.31 specific activity of 125i- xxxg742xxx  was 29.4 ␮ci/␮g protein.
human pk, as well as factors ix, ixa, x, and xiia, was purchased from
enzyme research laboratories (south bend, in).

activation of  xxxg752xxx  by fxia. activation of  xxxg752xxx  by activated
proteases was evaluated as described.23 briefly, enzyme (0.2 ␮g/ml) was
incubated at 37°c for 1 minute with  xxxg752xxx  (0.05-1.0 ␮m) in tbsa
containing 5 mm cacl2. activation was stopped by adding edta to 25
mm. the reaction was diluted 1:100 in tbsa, and 10 ␮l was added to 50
␮l of a mixture of factor viii (8 u/ml; recombinate baxter/hyland,
glendale, ca), cacl2 (10 mm), and rabbit brain cephalin, and to 30 ␮l
 xxxg741xxx  (450 nm). incubations were at 37° c for 2.5 minutes, and then
edta was added as above. fifty microliters of each reaction was mixed
with 50 ␮l 1.0 mm s-2765, and change in absorbance at 405 nm was
followed on the microtiter plate reader. results were compared to a control
curve constructed with purified factor ixa. michaelis-menten constants
were determined, using averages from 3 separate experiments. rabbit brain
cephalin was made from rabbit brain acetone extract (sigma, st louis, mo)
by the method of bell and alton.32
platelet-binding experiments
gel-filtered human platelets were prepared from fresh blood as previously
described.33  xxxg746xxx  agonist sfllrn-amide was prepared at
the protein chemistry facility of the university of pennsylvania.25 binding
experiments were performed by a modification of published methods.12
briefly, platelets (108/ml) were activated by 5 ␮m sfflrn-amide for
5 minutes at 37°c and then supplemented with  xxxd3556xxx  (25 ␮m), cacl2
(2 mm), hk (50 nm), and 125i-labeled plasma-derived  xxxg742xxx  (22 nm) either
in the presence or absence of recombinant proteins. incubation was
continued for 30 minutes at 37°c. aliquots (100 ␮l) were layered on dow
corning methyl silicon oil (3 parts 550 density oil:2 parts 200 density oil)
and platelets were separated from unbound protein by centrifugation in a
microfuge. 125i- xxxg742xxx  bound to the platelet pellet was measured with a
wallace 1470 wizard gamma counter. the concentration of cold protein
that displaced 50% of bound 125i- xxxg742xxx  (ic50) was determined by plotting
125i- xxxg742xxx  bound to platelets against the concentration of competing ligand.
ki was calculated, using the equation ic50 ⫽ (1 ⫹ [s]/kd) ki, where s is the
concentration of 125i- xxxg742xxx  (22 nm) and kd is the binding constant for  xxxg742xxx 
determined by direct binding experiments (10 nm).
activity of recombinant proteins in plasma clotting assays

protein (10-20 ␮g) in 100-200 ␮l of tbs underwent size-fractionation on a
superose-12 gel filtration column (amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj) fitted to a biologic fplc workstation (biorad, richmond, ca).
the column was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate ph 7.3 and
150 mm nacl. fractions of eluate (500 ␮l) were collected. retention times
of proteins (determined by od 280 nm) were compared to a series of
protein standards. the identity of the eluted protein was confirmed by
performing western immunoblot analysis on column fractions (data
not shown).

coagulant activities for zymogen  xxxg742xxx /pka4 and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 were
determined by aptt assay. hepes-tyrode buffer ph 7.4 (100 ␮l)
containing 1 nm  xxxg742xxx /pka4 or  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 was mixed with 50 ␮l
 xxxg742xxx -deficient plasma. to this mixture was added 50 ␮l kaolin (5 mg/ml)
in hepes-tyrode buffer ph 7.4 containing either phospholipid (inosithin
0.04%; accurate chemicals, westbury, ny) or activated platelets (108/ml).
incubation was for 5 minutes at 37°c, followed by addition of 50 ␮l 50
mm cacl2. time to fibrin clot formation was determined on a fibrometer.
all proteins were tested in triplicate and were compared to a standard curve
prepared with wild-type  xxxg742xxx . one nanomolar wild-type  xxxg742xxx  was assigned
an activity of 1.00 (100%). fxia and activated chimeric enzymes were
tested in a similar manner, except that phospholipid or platelet suspensions
did not contain kaolin, and incubation at 37°c was for 60 seconds prior to
addition of cacl2. a standard curve was prepared with wild-type fxia (1
nm fxia was assigned an activity of 1.00 or 100%).

chromogenic substrate assays

western immunoblot analysis of  xxxg752xxx  activation by fxia

chromogenic substrates s-2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-pnitroanaline) and s-2765 (n-␣-benzyoxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-glycyl-larginine-p-nitroanaline) were from diapharma (westchester, oh).
cleavage of s-2366 by fxia. activated proteins were diluted to 0.5
␮g/ml in tbs with 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (tbsa) containing
50-1000 ␮m s-2366, and change in absorbance at 405 nm was followed on
a microtiter plate reader. michaelis-menten constants (km and vmax) were
determined by standard methods, using the average of 2 separate experiments. values for vmax were converted to nm pna/sec, using an extinction
coefficient of 9800 optical density units (405 nm)/mole of pna. turnover
number (kcat) was calculated from the ratio of vmax to enzyme concentration.

human  xxxg752xxx  (150 nm) was incubated at 37°c with 1 nm wild-type
fxia or activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4 in tbsa that contained 2 mm cacl2. at
various time points, 10 ␮l samples were removed into 5 ␮l sds-sample
buffer (500 mm tris-hcl ph 6.8, 40% glycerol, 10% sds). a second set of
experiments was carried out under similar conditions, except that reactions
included hk (50 nm),  xxxd3556xxx  (25 ␮m), and activated platelets (0.5 ⫻
108/ml). samples were size-fractionated on 12% polyacrylamide gels,
followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. blots were developed
with a goat antihuman  xxxg752xxx  polyclonal immunoglobulin g (affinity
biologicals, hamilton, ontario, canada), using an enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting detection kit (amersham pharmacia biotech).

recombinant proteins

human  xxxg742xxx  is a 160-kd disulfide bond-linked dimer comprised of 2
identical 80-kd polypeptides (figure 1a, lanes 1 and 4).18,20 the a4
domain mediates dimer formation, with cys321 in a4 forming the
inter-chain disulfide bond.34  xxxg742xxx  in which cys321 is replaced by
alanine ( xxxg742xxx -ala321, figure 1a, lane 3) is an 80-kd protein on
nonreducing sds-page; however, gel filtration experiments performed under conditions of physiologic salt concentration and ph
demonstrate that it is the same size as plasma factor xi (figure 1b).
this suggests that the protein is a noncovalently associated dimer.
these data confirm earlier work, demonstrating that an inter-chain
disulfide bond is not required for dimer formation.34 in contrast, pk
(figure 1a, lane 5), which is structurally homologous to  xxxg742xxx ,20,22
has a higher retention time on gel filtration (molecular mass ⬃90
kd; figure 1), demonstrating it is a monomer.34
to prepare monomeric  xxxg742xxx , the a4 domain was replaced with
pka4. the resulting protein,  xxxg742xxx /pka4, as expected, is an 80-kd

protein on nonreducing sds-page (figure 1c, lane 2). in gel
filtration experiments,  xxxg742xxx /pka4 has a similar retention time to
pk, indicating it is a monomer (figure 1d).  xxxg742xxx /pka4 is
expressed poorly by 293 fibroblasts (⬍ 100 ng/ml conditioned
media).27 this is consistent with data showing that mutations
interfering with  xxxg742xxx  intracellular dimerization result in poor
protein expression.35,36 dimeric  xxxg742xxx /pka4 ( xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326)
was made by replacing cys326 in  xxxg742xxx /pka4 with glycine. cys326
in pka4 is normally paired with cys321 to form an intra-chain
disulfide bond. its removal leaves cys321 free to form an
inter-chain disulfide-link with cys321 on another polypeptide.
 xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 is expressed by 293 cells at similar levels to
wild-type  xxxg742xxx  (data not shown), and the expressed protein is
entirely dimeric (figure 1c, lane 4, and 1d). parenthetically, this
suggests that elements in  xxxg742xxx  distinct from the a4 domain are
involved in promoting dimer formation.
fxia activity in purified protein assays

activated proteases were studied in 2 purified protein systems. in
the first system, the capacities of the proteases to cleave the
chromogenic substrate s-2366 were tested. kinetic parameters for
s-2366 cleavage are similar for all proteins tested (table 1),
indicating that the catalytic domains are intact. kinetic parameters
for activation of  xxxg752xxx  by recombinant proteases were determined by a 3-stage assay.23,27 the results demonstrate that activated
 xxxg742xxx /pka4 and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 activate  xxxg752xxx  similarly to
fxia (table 1). this indicates that both chimeric molecules bind
normally to, and have normal catalytic activity toward,  xxxg752xxx 
when activation takes place in solution.

 xxxg742xxx /pka4 and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 were tested for their capacity to
compete with 125i-labeled  xxxg742xxx  for binding to activated platelets
(figure 2). results were compared to those for plasma-derived  xxxg742xxx 
(positive control) and to  xxxg742xxx /pka3 (negative control).  xxxg742xxx /pka3,
a chimera consisting of  xxxg742xxx  with the a3 domain replaced by the
pka3 domain,27 binds poorly to platelets because pka3 lacks
critical amino acids required for platelet binding.15,25 the ki for
 xxxg742xxx /pka4 (14 nm) and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 (16 nm) are similar to
the value for plasma  xxxg742xxx  (12 nm), indicating the 3 proteins bind to
platelets with similar avidity. in contrast, the ki for  xxxg742xxx /pka3 is
more than 500 nm, a result similar to reported values for pk
binding to platelets.12

assay under nonreducing conditions. wild-type fxia and activated
 xxxg742xxx /pka4 activate  xxxg752xxx  to factor ixa␤ similarly in the
absence of platelets (figure 3a). in contrast, and consistent with
the results of the clotting assays, activation by activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4
is significantly reduced compared to wild-type fxia and activated
xi/pka4-gly326 when activated platelets are included in the
reaction (figure 3b). it is not clear if the relatively small amount of
factor ixa␤ generated by  xxxg742xxx /pka4 represents enzyme activity on
the platelet surface, or activation in solution phase by  xxxg742xxx /pka4
that has not bound to the platelet.

discussion
figure 2. binding of  xxxg742xxx  and chimeric proteins to activated platelets.  xxxg742xxx  and
 xxxg742xxx /pk chimeras were used in competition binding studies as competitive ligands for
22 nm 125i- xxxg742xxx  binding to activated platelets in the presence of 50 nm hk and 25 ␮m
 xxxd3556xxx . plasma-derived  xxxg742xxx  (e),  xxxg742xxx /pka3 (䡺),  xxxg742xxx /pka4 (‚), and  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326
(䉫). data are mean values (⫾ sem) of total binding results from 3 separate
experiments, each performed in triplicate.

phospholipid is required for several enzymatic steps.3 activated
platelets may serve as a source of phospholipid. clot formation in
this type of assay depends on  xxxg752xxx  activation by fxia. in aptt
assays using purified phospholipid (inosithin),  xxxg742xxx /pka4 and
 xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 correct the defect in  xxxg742xxx -deficient plasma
similarly to wild-type  xxxg742xxx  (table 2, column 1). in contrast, when
the phospholipids are replaced by activated platelets, only the
dimeric protein  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 shows significant activity (table
2, column 2). in the presence of activated platelets, the activity of
monomeric  xxxg742xxx /pka4 is below the lower limit of detection of
the assay.
these data indicate that activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4 bound to platelets
does not properly activate  xxxg752xxx . alternatively, zymogen
 xxxg742xxx /pka4 may not be activated well in this system. to distinguish
between these possibilities, a modified clotting assay was performed in which coagulation is initiated by fxia or activated
chimera rather than by kaolin. poor activation of  xxxg742xxx /pka4 is not
an issue in this case as the protease is added in the active form.
activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4 and activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 demonstrate significant activity in the presence of phospholipid (table 2,
column 3). however, consistent with the results obtained using
zymogens in the aptt assay, activated  xxxg742xxx /pka4 has little activity
in the presence of activated platelets compared to its dimeric
counterpart  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 (table 2, column 4).

the formation of protease-substrate complexes on activated platelets and damaged tissue is crucial for normal hemostasis.1-5 in
complexes involving  xxxd3522xxx –dependent proteases (prothrombin
and factors vii, ix, and x), both protease and substrate bind to
phospholipid in an interaction involving the n-terminal “gladomain” of each protein.2,3 gla-domains contain 10 to 12 glutamic
acid residues that undergo post-translational modification by
addition of a carboxyl group to the ␥-carbon.37 this modification is
necessary for calcium-dependent protein binding to phospholipid.
 xxxg742xxx  is the only  xxxg745xxx  required for normal coagulation that
lacks a gla-domain.19,20 this may explain why phospholipid has
little effect on  xxxg752xxx  activation by fxia. although  xxxg742xxx  may not
interact with purified phospholipid, it is clear that  xxxg742xxx  and fxia

 xxxg752xxx  activation by fxia in the presence of platelets

during activation of  xxxg752xxx  (molecular mass 55 kd), an
approximately 11-kd activation peptide is released to generate the
active enzyme, factor ixa␤ (45 kd).6-8 therefore, the activation of
 xxxg752xxx  by fxia can be directly observed by western immunoblot

 xxxg752xxx  activation on platelets

3121

figure 4. a model for the activation of  xxxg742xxx  and factor
ix on activated platelets. the  xxxg742xxx  or fxia molecule is a
dimer composed of 2 identical 80-kd polypeptides, each
containing 4 apple domains (designated a1 through a4),
and one trypsin-like catalytic domain. for the sake of
clarity, schematic representations of  xxxg742xxx  are shown only
with apple domains involved in the relevant interaction.
 xxxg742xxx  binds to the surface of an activated platelet through
one of its a3 domains in a reaction that requires either hk
and zn2⫹, or prothrombin (pt) and ca⫹⫹. hk or pt (shown
interacting with the a1 domain of  xxxg742xxx  in the solution
phase of the diagram) appears to be required for  xxxg742xxx  to
be in the proper conformation for binding to the platelet
but does not appear to be a necessary component of a
platelet-binding site for  xxxg742xxx . it is not known if  xxxg742xxx  interacts
with either hk or pt on the platelet surface. furthermore,
it is not clear if hk and pt interact with one or both
polypeptides of the  xxxg742xxx  dimer.  xxxg742xxx  bound to the platelet is
activated to fxia by thrombin, factor xiia, or factor
xia.13,14  xxxg752xxx  binds to fxia through the heavy chain
not involved in binding to the platelet. available data
suggest that the  xxxg752xxx  binding site on fxia involves
components of the a2 and a3 domains.23,24,27 fxia then
converts  xxxg752xxx  (fix) to factor ixa (fixa) in a reaction
requiring calcium ions.6 abbreviations:  xxxg742xxx , factor xi;
fxia, factor xia; fix,  xxxg752xxx ; fixa, factor ixa␤; a1
througha4, factor xi apple domains 1 through 4, respectively;

bind to activated platelets.11,12 amino acids in the c-terminus of the
a3 domain are required for platelet binding.15,25 curiously, this
region may overlap with the  xxxg752xxx  binding site. as data suggest
that the platelet surface is a physiologic site for  xxxg742xxx  activation and
activity, this finding raises a question as to the manner in which
fxia would bind simultaneously to its substrate and a platelet
surface.23,26 a possible answer may be found in the dimeric
structure of  xxxg742xxx .
human  xxxg742xxx  is a disulfide-bond linked homodimer,19,20 a unique
feature among coagulation proteases. meijers et al34 demonstrated
that the a4 domain is involved in dimer formation,34 with cys321
involved in the inter-chain disulfide bond.20,34 to test the significance of the dimeric state to  xxxg742xxx  function, a  xxxg742xxx  monomer is
required for comparison. taking advantage of the homology
between  xxxg742xxx  and pk (a monomeric protein), we generated the
monomeric chimera  xxxg742xxx /pka4. as in  xxxg742xxx , there is a cysteine at
position 321 in pka4; however, it is involved in an intra-chain
bond with cys326, a residue unique to pk.  xxxg742xxx /pka4 is expressed
poorly in 293 cells,27 consistent with work showing that dimerization is necessary for proper protein secretion.35,36 indeed, meijers et
al34 postulated that  xxxg742xxx  may be dimeric to facilitate intracellular
processing and secretion. in our experiments with  xxxg742xxx /pk chimeras, arrangements placing the a3 domain of  xxxg742xxx  in a monomeric
protein result in poor expression (d.g., unpublished observation,
november 1999). this suggests that fxia3, in contrast to pka3,
prefers to be a component of a dimer. this is supported by the
normal expression of  xxxg742xxx /pka4-gly326 in 293 cell culture.
despite lacking fxia4, a  xxxd1788xxx  at cys321 facilitates dimer
formation (possibly driven by the a3 domain) and improves the
poor expression seen with  xxxg742xxx /pka4.
we compared  xxxg742xxx /pka4 to wild-type  xxxg742xxx  and  xxxg742xxx /pka4gly326 in a series of assays requiring  xxxg752xxx  activation by fxia.
in the absence of activated platelets (either in purified protein or
plasma clotting assays) the 3 molecules performed similarly. in
contrast, when activated platelets are used as a lipid source,
monomeric  xxxg742xxx /pka4 demonstrates a defect in  xxxg752xxx  activation. several scenarios must be considered as explanations for this
observation.  xxxg742xxx /pka4 may be activated poorly on the platelet

surface in an aptt assay. however,  xxxg742xxx /pka4 has poor activity
even when added to the assay in the activated state. similarly, it is
difficult to invoke abnormalities in  xxxg742xxx /pka4 platelet binding
because  xxxg742xxx /pka4 and wild-type  xxxg742xxx  have similar affinities for
platelets. a hypothesis that fits all experimental data well is that
monomeric fxia is unable to interact simultaneously with activated platelets and  xxxg752xxx . the findings are consistent with a
scenario in which fxia binds to a platelet by one polypeptide of the
dimer, while interacting with  xxxg752xxx  through the other. a model
based on this hypothesis is shown in figure 4.
several assumptions were made in preparing the model that
require further testing and may, therefore, not be accurate. for
example, it is likely that  xxxg752xxx  is bound to the platelet through
its gla-domain during activation, rather than being in solution as
shown in figure 4. in addition, it is not clear if one or both fxia
catalytic domains interact with the substrate. a study by wolberg et
al38 suggested that the 2 proteolytic cleavages made in  xxxg752xxx 
during activation by fxia may require both fxia catalytic
domains. finally, for most reactions involving  xxxd3522xxx –dependent coagulation proteases, phospholipid or activated platelets are
both suitable surfaces. in contrast, our results strongly indicate that
fxia behaves differently in the presence of activated platelets
compared to purified phospholipid. this suggests that fxia may be
interacting with a platelet membrane protein rather than the
phospholipid component of the platelet membrane as shown in
figure 4. in this regard, preliminary data indicating that  xxxg742xxx  binds
to glycocalycin, the extramembrane portion of glycoprotein ib, are
of interest (p.n.w., unpublished observations, june 1999). additional work will be required to validate this model; however, it
offers a reasonable explanation as to why  xxxg742xxx , alone among
coagulation proteases, is dimeric.
