the sex steroid  xxxd3023xxx  is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland
epithelium during pregnancy. in relation to this, in vitro studies using breast carcinoma t47d cells have
demonstrated a biphasic  xxxd3023xxx  response, consisting of an initial proliferative burst followed by a
sustained growth arrest. however, the transcriptional factors acting with the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) to
mediate the  xxxd3023xxx  effects on mammary cell growth and differentiation remain to be determined.
recently, it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kda (trep-132), initially
identified as a regulator of steroidogenesis, is also a cell growth suppressor. similar to  xxxd3023xxx -bound pr,
trep-132 acts by inducing the gene expression of the g1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  (p21)
and  xxxg419xxx  (p27). the putative interaction between trep-132 and  xxxd3023xxx  pathways in mammary cells
was therefore analyzed in the present study. our results show that trep-132 interacts in vitro and in t47d
cells with  xxxd3023xxx -activated pr. trep-132 synergizes with  xxxd3023xxx -bound pr to trans activate the
p21 and p27 gene promoters at proximal sp1-binding sites. moreover, trep-132 overexpression and knockdown, respectively, increased or prevented the induction of p21 and p27 gene expression by  xxxd3023xxx . as
a consequence, trep-132 knockdown also resulted in the loss of the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3023xxx  on prb
phosphorylation, g1/s cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. furthermore, the knockdown of trep-132
expression also prevented the induction of both early and terminal markers of breast cell differentiation which
had been previously identified as  xxxd3023xxx  target genes. as well, the  xxxd3023xxx -induced accumulation
of lipid vacuoles was inhibited in the trep-132-depleted cells. finally, trep-132 gene expression levels
increased following  xxxd3023xxx  treatment, indicating the existence of a positive auto-regulatory loop between
pr and trep-132. taken together, these data identify trep-132 as a coactivator of pr mediating the
growth-inhibitory and differentiation effects of  xxxd3023xxx  on breast cancer cells.
indicated that pr-b is specifically required for the  xxxd3023xxx -dependent development of the mammary gland during
pregnancy (11).
in relation to the function of  xxxd3023xxx  in breast development, both growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory effects have
been previously reported on breast epithelium cells and cancer
development in tumor animal models (11, 42, 46). moreover,
in vitro studies using the pr-positive mammary carcinoma
t47d cell line as a model have demonstrated a biphasic cellular response to either  xxxd3023xxx  or its derivatives (r5020
or org 2058), with an immediate proliferative burst followed
by a sustained growth arrest (28, 38, 50). as with many hormones and growth factors, the regulation of retinoblastoma
gene product (prb) phosphorylation—a critical checkpoint of
the g1/s transition—plays a major role in the control of proliferation by  xxxd3023xxx  (18, 39, 71). the initial prb phosphorylation provoked by  xxxd3023xxx  is catalyzed by constitutively expressed cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), which are
activated through interaction with specific cyclins induced by
 xxxd3023xxx  (39). the ensuing growth arrest is associated, at
least in part, with the transitory induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cdkis)  xxxg418xxx / xxxg418xxx  (p21) and p18ink4c
(p18), followed by a sustained induction of  xxxg419xxx  (p27) (28,

the steroid hormones estrogen and  xxxd3023xxx  play key
roles in the growth of the mammary gland (49). estrogens
appear to be the main drive for proliferation of the mammary
gland epithelium, whereas  xxxd3023xxx  is required for its terminal growth and differentiation (27). the induction of mammary epithelial development during pregnancy is mediated by
a rise in  xxxd3023xxx  levels (51). the physiological effects of
 xxxd3023xxx  occur mainly via interaction with specific intracellular  xxxd3023xxx  receptors (prs), pr-a and pr-b, which
are products of a single gene and members of the nuclear
receptor (nr) family (11). studies performed on mice in which
the expression of both prs was ablated have demonstrated
that  xxxd3023xxx  is necessary for ductal branching and the
lobulo-alveolar development of the mammary gland (45).
more recently, selective ablation of each receptor isoform has

trep-132 in breast cancer cell growth inhibition

materials and methods
plasmids. the trep-132 expression vector subcloned in pcdna3 and the
wild-type or mutated  xxxg1073xxx  (gst)–trep-132 fusion protein
were constructed as previously described (24). the p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  and the  xxxg419xxx 
promoter luciferase reporter constructs were kindly provided by x. wang (dept.
of pharmacology, duke university medical center, durham, nc) (13) and t.
sakai (kyoto prefectural university of medicine, japan) (34), respectively.
cell culture assays. human t47d ductal carcinoma cells, a commonly used
model to study  xxxd3023xxx  signaling in breast cancer cells (e.g., references 28,
38, and 50), were obtained from the american type culture collection (rockville, md) and were cultured as monolayers as previously described (25). in all
assays, cells were first synchronized in g0/g1 phase by serum starvation for at
least 48 h in medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum.  xxxd3023xxx  (30 nm) or
ethanol (vehicle) was added daily when cells resumed proliferation by reincubation in the routine growth medium (corresponding to time zero of the experiments). each experiment was repeated at least three times, and values represent
the means ⫾ standard deviations (sd) of a representative experiment carried out
in triplicate.
cellular dna content and flow cytometry profiles were, respectively, performed by the staining of nuclear dna using the fluorochrome 3,5-diaminobenzoicacid free acid and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide as described previously (24).
transient transfections were performed with fugene 6 (roche molecular
biochemicals) as previously described (25). the efficiency of transfection, which
was verified using a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid, was ⱖ60%.
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described else-

where (24) by using 4 ␮g of anti-trep-132, anti-pr (ms-298; neomarkers), and
anti-p300 and anti-sp1 (sc-584x and sc-59, respectively; santa cruz biotechnology) antibodies for the immunoprecipitation of cell lysates.
immunocytological staining. t47d cells, subconfluently grown on glass coverslips, were transfected with small interfering rna (sirna), treated with
 xxxd3023xxx  or ethanol (vehicle) for 48 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). for fluorescent immunocytochemistry, cells were first permeabilized by boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer. the rabbit
polyclonal trep-132 antibody (24) or a rabbit nonimmune serum (as control)
was then detected with an alexafluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg; molecular probes). for lipid detection, cells were stained using
oil red o and counterstained with hematoxylin. after final washes, the coverslips and their attached cells were mounted on glass microscope slides using
mowiol mountant (hoechst, frankfurt, germany). specimens were visualized
and photographed using a leitz dmrb microscope and lhesa nb (for fluorescent immunocytochemistry) or leica dc480 video (for oil red o staining)
camera. oil red o staining intensity was quantified with adobe photoshop using
the public program from the national institutes of health (http://rsb.info.nih.gov
/nih-image/). results represent the means ⫾ sd of values from a single experiment (n ⫽ 6 fields/point) which was repeated four times with similar results.
reverse transcription and quantitative pcr. transcript levels in extracted
total rna were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr)
by using the oligonucleotide primers specific for human trep-132, p21, and p27
as described previously (24). in addition, the following primer pairs were used:
 xxxg661xxx , 5⬘-tgataaactcagacagcgcc-3⬘ and 5⬘-catcaaacac
cagcttggag-3⬘ (genbank identification number gi 58530839 ); na⫹/k⫹atpase ␣1, 5⬘-ctggcttgaggctgtcatcttcctc-3⬘ and 5⬘-ttccttg
ccatgcgtttggc-3⬘ (genbank identification number gi 48762680 ); fatty
acid synthase (fas), 5⬘-atcgtggacggaggcatcaacc-3⬘ and 5⬘-ttgg
ccatcatcgctcgctg-3⬘ (genbank identification number gi 41872630 ); tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (alp), 5⬘-tcactctccgagatggtggt
ggtgg-3⬘ and 5⬘-ttccttcatggtgcccgtgg-3⬘ (genbank identification
number gi 13787192 ). because of their stability during cell cycle progression, 28s
rna levels were simultaneously quantified for normalization. each figure indicates
mrna levels as means ⫾ sd (n ⫽ 3) of one experiment representative of at least
three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
knockdown of trep-132 expression. knockdown of trep-132 expression
using sirna was performed as described elsewhere (24) with slight modifications. briefly, oligonucleotides used for the generation of two trep-132 sirnas
targeting two distinct regions of trep-132 cdna (sirna-1, nucleotides 298 to
318; sirna-2, nucleotides 362 to 382) were synthesized by eurogentec. the
nonsilencing sirna oligonucleotide, which does not target any known mammalian gene and is used as a negative control, was from qiagen. transfections of
sirna duplexes (700 ng) were performed at 0 and 3 days using jetsi (polyplus
transfection, illkirch, france). the efficiency of the transfection was ascertained
by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) analysis (see below) following control transfection of a fluorescein-coupled nonsilencing sirna. the loss of endogenous trep-132 gene expression after transfection with trep-132 sirna
was verified by quantitative pcr and immunofluorescence using an anti-trep132 antibody as described previously (24). the nonsilencing sirna control did
not significantly influence trep-132 expression (data not shown). experiments
performed with trep-132 sirna-1 and -2 led to a decrease in trep-132 mrna
levels by ⬃77% and 62%, respectively, and comparable effects were obtained.
representative experiments have been performed with trep-132 sirna-1.
protein assays. in vitro gst pull-down analyses were performed as described
in reference 24. in-cell protein assays were performed as previously described
(23) according to the santa cruz biotechnology (california) protocol. cells were
washed twice with ice-cold pbs and collected with ice-cold ripa buffer (1⫻
pbs, 1% nonidet p-40, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx ,
phosphatase, and protease inhibitors). after removing cell debris by centrifugation, extracts were aliquoted and either used immediately (e.g., for coimmunoprecipitation assays) or stored at ⫺80°c. for coimmunoprecipitation assays,
whole-cell lysates in ripa buffer were first cleared with 1.0 ␮g nonimmune
rabbit igg (sc-2027; santa cruz), together with 30 ␮l of protein a-sepharose
beads (amersham biosciences, uppsala, sweden). after centrifugation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4°c with 1 ␮g of the anti-trep-132
antibody or nonimmune rabbit igg and then incubated overnight at 4°c with
protein a-sepharose. the immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times
with lysis buffer and once with pbs and then resuspended in electrophoresis
sample buffer. samples of immunoprecipitated or total proteins (30 ␮g) were
analyzed by western blotting using as antibodies the anti-pprb-ser807/811
antibody (9308; cell signaling) raised against a prb peptide phosphorylated on
the ser807/811 residue, which is phosphorylated by both  xxxg410xxx  and  xxxg411xxx /6

50, 69). associations of these cdkis with the different g1
cdk complexes lead to an inhibition of their activity and a
decrease in prb phosphorylation, resulting in an arrest in the
late g1 phase of the cell cycle. it is known that  xxxd3023xxx 
induces both p21 and p27 expression through a transcriptional
mechanism which involves interaction between progesteronebound pr, the general coactivator cbp/p300, and the transcription factor sp1 at proximal sp1-binding sites (25, 52).
however, given the fact that pr is expressed during both
phases of the  xxxd3023xxx  response (28, 50), it is likely that
yet-unidentified pr target genes and/or cofactors of pr are
involved with pr in the delayed growth-inhibitory effects of
 xxxd3023xxx .
the transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kda (trep132) was isolated as a novel factor implicated in the regulation
of various steroidogenic genes (21, 22, 26). notably, in human
adrenal carcinoma nci-h295 cells, trep-132 acts as a coactivator of the nuclear receptor  xxxg1604xxx  to enhance cytochrome p450 side chain cleavage ( xxxg570xxx ) and c17
( xxxg573xxx ) gene promoter activity (23). recently, we identified
a new function for trep-132 as a growth suppressor protein in
hela and mammary cancer cells (24). as with pr, the antiproliferative activity of trep-132 involves its interaction with
sp1 to activate the p21 and p27 promoters, resulting in the
inhibition of g1 cdk-mediated phosphorylation of prb and
histone h1. considering the ability of trep-132 to function as
a nuclear receptor coactivator, in this study we tested whether
trep-132 interacts with pr and influence the progesteronedependent regulation of mammary cancer cell growth. using
the t47d cell line as a model, we show that trep-132 does
indeed act as a pr coactivator to activate the p21 and p27 gene
promoters. furthermore, we show that trep-132 gene expression itself is steadily induced by  xxxd3023xxx , which is necessary for the long-term growth-inhibitory and differentiating
effects of the hormone. thus, trep-132 is likely to mediate a
positive feedback loop in the  xxxd3023xxx  response which is
crucial for the delayed and sustained action of  xxxd3023xxx  in
breast cancer cells.

statistical analyses. statistical analyses were done using the nonparametric
mann-whitney test.

results
trep-132 enhances the  xxxd3023xxx  response of the cdki
p21 and p27 gene promoters. trep-132 and progesteronebound pr have been shown to activate the p21 and p27 genes
by interacting with sp1 through the same proximal sp1-binding
elements (composed of the sp1-3 and sp1-4 sites for p21 [25,
52] and the sp1-1 and sp1-2 sites for p27 [24, 25]). therefore,
it was hypothesized that trep-132 and pr may functionally
interact at these proximal sp1 response elements to activate
transcription of both promoters. to test this, wild-type p21 or
p27 promoter reporter constructs (denoted as p21luc and
p27luc, respectively) were cotransfected with the trep-132
expression plasmid in pr-positive breast carcinoma t47d cells

(21, 22, 24), and cells were treated or not with  xxxd3023xxx 
(fig. 1). confirming the results of previous studies (24, 25,
52), trep-132 or  xxxd3023xxx  treatment alone stimulated both
p21 and p27 gene promoter activities. interestingly, a synergistic
effect of trep-132 and  xxxd3023xxx  was observed on both
cdki promoters. to further assess the roles of the sp1 sites in
this response, the p21 and p27 reporter constructs mutated at
each sp1 site were transiently cotransfected with trep-132 in
cells incubated or not with  xxxd3023xxx  (fig. 1). as previously
reported, the mutation of the sp1-3 and sp1-1 sites diminished
the basal activity and abolished the responses of the p21 and p27
promoters to trep-132 or  xxxd3023xxx  alone (24, 25, 52). moreover, the mutation of either the sp1-4 or the sp1-2 sites resulted
in the reduction of  xxxd3023xxx -dependent trans activation of the
p21 or p27 promoters, respectively. however, mutation of each of
these sites prevented the synergistic effects of trep-132 and
 xxxd3023xxx  on both promoters. these results indicate that
trep-132 cooperates with the  xxxd3023xxx  pathway to trans
activate proximal sp1 response elements of p21 and p27 gene
promoters.

trep-132 in breast cancer cell growth inhibition

trep-132 is recruited by  xxxd3023xxx -activated pr at proximal sp1-binding sites of p21 and p27 gene promoters. to
investigate the in-cell occupancy of these sp1-binding sites by
trep-132 and the influence of  xxxd3023xxx  on this, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed on dna isolated from t47d cells treated or not with  xxxd3023xxx  (fig.
2a). in good correlation with our previous findings in hela

cells (24), trep-132 was found to be associated by immunoprecipitation with the proximal sp1-binding elements of the
p21 and p27 genes. interestingly, this association was greater in
 xxxd3023xxx -treated than in vehicle-incubated cells.
previous reports have indicated that the cbp/p300 protein
functions as a coactivator of pr (44, 65) and cooperates with
pr at the proximal sp1-binding sites of the p21 and p27 gene
promoters to increase their activities (25, 52). concurring with
these data, pr, trep-132, and sp1 were found to be present
together with cbp/p300 at proximal sp1 elements of the p21
and p27 promoters in  xxxd3023xxx -treated t47d cells (fig.
2b). as a control of specificity, amplification using primers
covering regions ⬃1 kb upstream of these sites or oligonucleotides specific for the ␤-actin gene resulted in nonrelevant background products.
the putative interaction between trep-132 and  xxxd3023xxx -activated pr was then analyzed. to this end, we first
determined in coimmunoprecipitation assays whether endogenous trep-132 and pr interact in t47d cells treated or not
for 12 h with  xxxd3023xxx  and the partial pr antagonist
ru486 (fig. 3a). low levels of endogenous pr were found in
the complex immunoprecipitated by the anti-trep-132 antibody in untreated t47d cells. however, the amount of pr
coimmunoprecipitated with trep-132 drastically increased in
cells treated with  xxxd3023xxx  alone. this effect was attenuated by cotreatment with ru486. to further assess whether
trep-132 interacts in vitro with pr, gst pull-down assays
were performed with gst–trep-132 and pr proteins (fig.
3b). the results indicated that trep-132 interacts physically
with pr and that this interaction is enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by  xxxd3023xxx  (fig. 3b, top left panel). in good
correlation with fig. 3a, the binding observed between trep132 and  xxxd3023xxx -activated pr diminished in the presence
of ru486 (fig. 3b, top right panel). we previously demonstrated that trep-132 contains two putative nuclear receptor
box (nr-box) lxxll motifs at amino acids 181 (lrqll)
and 863 (lemll) (22), which are nuclear receptor interaction
domains of numerous transcriptional coregulatory proteins
(30). interestingly, the mutation of either lxxll motif drastically reduced the binding of trep-132 to pr. this indicates
the importance of both lxxll motifs in the in vitro interaction between trep-132 and pr (fig. 3b, lower panel).
taken together, these results suggest that trep-132 is recruited by  xxxd3023xxx -activated pr through its nr-box
lxxll motifs in the regulatory complexes formed with sp1 at
proximal sp1-binding sites of the p21 and p27 gene promoters.
trep-132 expression is required for the  xxxd3023xxx -induced increase of p21 and p27 expression and inhibition of
g1/s t47d cell cycle progression. the next question we addressed was whether trep-132 is required for the induction of
p21 and p27 expression as well as the regulation of cell proliferation by  xxxd3023xxx .
first, the expression of both genes in response to  xxxd3023xxx  was assessed in t47d cells in which trep-132 expression
was silenced using an sirna strategy (24) (fig. 4). concurring
with reference 24, the decrease of trep-132 expression resulted in a significant down-regulation of both p21 and p27
mrna (fig. 4a) and protein levels (fig. 4b). moreover, in
good agreement with previous observations (28, 50),  xxxd3023xxx  treatment resulted in an early and transient up-regula-

fig. 2.  xxxd3023xxx  enhances trep-132 recruitment at multiprotein complexes formed with pr and cbp/p300 at proximal sp1 elements of the p21 and p27 promoters. soluble chromatin was prepared
from t47d cells incubated with  xxxd3023xxx  (30 nm) or ethanol
(vehicle) (a) or with  xxxd3023xxx  (30 nm) alone (b) for 2 h 30 min
before lysis. immunoprecipitations were then performed using antibodies as indicated (top). controls included pcrs done without dna
(h2o) or with nonprecipitated genomic dna (input) or immunoprecipitation assays performed without antibody (no ab) or with an irrelevant antibody (anti-ha). the extracted dna was amplified using the
primer pairs covering either the ⫺83/⫺65  xxxd3023xxx -responsive

region of the p21 gene located ⬃1 kb from this element, the ⫺545/

element, or a ␤-actin gene region (lower panel).

trep-132 in breast cancer cell growth inhibition

tion of p21, followed by a delayed and sustained up-regulation
of p27. strikingly, this  xxxd3023xxx -dependent modulation of
p21 and p27 gene expression was completely abolished upon
sirna-mediated specific silencing of trep-132.
next, the influence of trep-132 silencing on the growthinhibitory effects of  xxxd3023xxx  was tested. in good correlation with previous reports, cell growth of control-transfected
cells was inhibited by  xxxd3023xxx  after 4 and 6 days of treatment as a consequence of p21 and p27 up-regulation (28, 50),
and silencing of trep-132 provoked an increased proliferation
of untreated cells (24). however, sirna silencing of trep132 completely prevented the growth-inhibitory effects of  xxxd3023xxx  (fig. 5a). to assess the specificity of this effect, the
role of trep-132 in the response to rosiglitazone, a ligand of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥) which
has been previously reported to also inhibit mammary cancer

cell growth (19, 48), was also analyzed. in contrast to  xxxd3023xxx , silencing of trep-132 did not alleviate the growthinhibitory effects of rosiglitazone on t47d cells (fig. 5b). this
therefore indicates that trep-132 specifically mediates the
inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation by pr.
finally, the cell cycle phase distribution and in-cell prb
phosphorylation status were analyzed (fig. 6). as previously
reported (28, 50),  xxxd3023xxx  induced an initial acceleration
of cell cycle progression (fig. 6a, left panel; performed after
6 h of  xxxd3023xxx  treatment), followed by an inhibition of the
g1/s transition (fig. 6a, right panel; performed after 24 h of
 xxxd3023xxx  treatment) which was associated with an inhibition of prb phosphorylation (fig. 6b; performed 24 h after
 xxxd3023xxx  treatment). interestingly, sirna-induced trep132 silencing did not affect the early cell mitogenic response to
 xxxd3023xxx . by contrast, trep-132 knockdown prevented
the subsequent decreases in the percentage of cells in the s
phase as well as the regulation of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated prb levels (fig. 6a, right panel, and b).
collectively, these data indicate a specific role for trep-132
as a coactivator of pr in the regulation of the progesteroneinduced g1-phase cell cycle arrest of breast cancer cells.
trep-132 mediates the differentiation-enhancing activities
of  xxxd3023xxx  in breast cancer cells. recent in vitro reports
have associated the ability of  xxxd3023xxx  and its derivatives
to negatively control mammary cancer cell proliferation with
the induction of a cell differentiation program (3, 43, 50),
which leads to the acquisition of a secretory phenotype (15,
29). therefore, we tested whether sirna silencing of trep132 also influences the effects of  xxxd3023xxx  on t47d cell
differentiation. to this end, the expression levels of a panel of
previously identified markers of early and terminal differentiation in breast cancer cells (15, 35, 37) were analyzed (fig. 7a
and b). as reported,  xxxd3023xxx  induced the early gene
expression of  xxxg661xxx  and na⫹/k⫹-atpase ␣1 (37),
which are markers for epithelial differentiation and glandular
development, respectively (56, 67) (fig. 7a). moreover, concurring with previous data (16, 35),  xxxd3023xxx  increased the
expression of fas and alp, which are markers of differentiation correlating with lipid storage in breast cancer cells (9, 15)
(fig. 7b). interestingly, the induction of each of these mrna
levels was abolished by trep-132 knockdown (fig. 7a and b).
concurring with these rna data,  xxxd3023xxx  treatment induced an accumulation of lipid droplets as visualized by oil
red o staining, and this effect was significantly decreased by
⬃87% in trep-132-deficient cells (fig. 7c).
therefore, the induction of a differentiated secretory phenotype of breast cancer cells by  xxxd3023xxx  requires the
expression of trep-132.
trep-132 gene expression is induced by  xxxd3023xxx . since
 xxxd3023xxx  exerts biphasic effects on mammary cancer cell
proliferation despite the continuous presence of transcriptionally competent pr, it has been proposed that the long-term
growth arrest provoked by  xxxd3023xxx  requires the induction
of additional factors (28, 50). to determine whether trep-132
expression is regulated by  xxxd3023xxx , trep-132 mrna
levels were measured by quantitative rt-pcr analysis in
t47d cells following  xxxd3023xxx  treatment (fig. 8). interestingly, treatment with  xxxd3023xxx  provoked a long-lasting increase in trep-132 mrna levels which was already obvious

within 12 h of treatment (fig. 8a, left panel). induction of
trep-132 mrna levels by  xxxd3023xxx  was inhibited by  xxxd1800xxx  (an inhibitor of rna polymerase ii), but not
by cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) (fig.
8a, right panel), indicating that  xxxd3023xxx -bound pr
may directly induce trep-132 gene transcription. correlating with mrna data, trep-132 protein levels increased in
 xxxd3023xxx -treated t47d cells, as shown by fluorescence
immunocytochemistry after 24 h of  xxxd3023xxx  treatment
(fig. 8b). together, these results indicate that trep-132 is
a  xxxd3023xxx -responsive gene acting with pr in a positive
feedback loop that inhibits mammary cell proliferation and
stimulates differentiation.
discussion
it has been proposed that the delayed growth arrest provoked by sustained  xxxd3023xxx  treatment requires the presence and/or activation of other transcription factors and/or
coregulators acting with pr (28). both trep-132 and  xxxd3023xxx  have been previously shown to act at the g1/s transition
checkpoint through similar mechanisms, i.e., the transcriptional induction of the p21 and p27 cdki gene promoters via
their proximal sp1-binding sites (25, 28, 50, 52). knockdown of
p21 and p27 expression using an sirna approach prevented
the growth-inhibitory response to either  xxxd3023xxx  or
trep-132 (25, 28, 50, 52; data not shown), highlighting their
requirements for both inhibitory pathways. therefore, in the
present study, we analyzed whether pr and trep-132 also
cross talk in the control of these cell cycle-regulating genes in
the trep-132- and pr-expressing mammary carcinoma t47d
cell line (21, 22, 24). our results indicate that trep-132 is
rapidly recruited following  xxxd3023xxx  treatment to the multiprotein complex formed with pr and cbp/p300 at proximal
sp1-binding elements of the p21 and p27 gene promoters.

moreover, trep-132 and  xxxd3023xxx  synergize to trans activate the p21 and p27 gene promoters through these proximal
sp1-binding sites. coimmunoprecipitation on intact cells and
gst pull-down assays further revealed a physical interaction
between pr and trep-132 that was enhanced by  xxxd3023xxx 
and mediated by the two lxxll nr-boxes of trep-132.
these observations thus identify a novel function for trep132 as a coactivator of pr implicated in the progesteronedependent regulation of the p21 and p27 genes.
basal trep-132 levels may be sufficient to initiate the
growth-inhibitory  xxxd3023xxx  response via a direct transcriptional effect on the p21 and p27 gene promoters. indeed, the
induction of p21 and p27 observed after 24-h  xxxd3023xxx 
treatment was inhibited by the rna polymerase ii inhibitor
 xxxd1800xxx  but was not affected by the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide (data not shown). however, it was
noteworthy that  xxxd3023xxx  treatment also provoked an
early and steady induction of trep-132 gene expression itself.
although a positive control by  xxxd3023xxx  of the expression
of pr coactivators such as  xxxg1510xxx  and cbp/p300 has been
observed in normal human endometrium (60), to our knowledge such molecular pathways have not been shown in breast
tissue yet. moreover, trep-132 knockdown experiments demonstrated that trep-132 expression is necessary for the consecutive  xxxd3023xxx -induced transitory p21 and long-lasting
p27 increases and the consequent inhibitory effects on g1/s cell
cycle progression. concurring with this, we have previously
shown that trep-132 and p27 gene expression levels correlate
with pr levels in human primary breast tumor biopsies (24,
25). these data indicate that trep-132 mediates, as both a pr
cofactor and a target gene, a positive feedback loop participating in the growth-inhibitory response to  xxxd3023xxx  (28, 50).

(19, 48). interestingly, trep-132 sirna did not affect either
the transcriptional up-regulation by  xxxd3023xxx  of metallothionein iia and pepsinogen c, which are genes not directly
related to cell cycle control and are regulated by  xxxd3023xxx 
via a canonical pr-responsive element (5, 63) (data not
shown). thus, specific interactions between pr, trep-132,
and other proteins included in the multiprotein complexes
formed at proximal sp1-binding elements of the cell cycle
regulatory p21 and p27 genes appear to exist and underlie the
growth-inhibitory response to  xxxd3023xxx . importantly, lowering of sp1 levels by ⬃60% using an sirna approach resulted
in a significant decrease of p21 and p27 mrna levels in both
the absence and presence of  xxxd3023xxx  (data not shown).
this indicates the requirement of sp1 for basal and  xxxd3023xxx -stimulated p21 and p27 promoter activities. however,

as shown for the trans activation of the p21 gene by ppar␥
(31), it is obvious that the contribution of sp3 and/or sp4
protein in the regulation of the p21 and/or p27 promoters by
trep-132 and  xxxd3023xxx  cannot be excluded. besides, in
addition to the two nr-box lxxll motifs, the primary structure of trep-132 also contains several other putative interaction domains with coregulatory proteins (22). significantly,
trep-132 interacts in vitro and in nci-h295 cells with cbp/
p300 (22, 23), which is, to date, the only known pr coactivator
that synergizes with  xxxd3023xxx -bound pr to trans activate
the p21 and p27 promoters (25, 52). whether additional transcriptional regulatory factors such as cbp/p300 interact also
with trep-132 to mediate the  xxxd3023xxx  response therefore remains to be analyzed.
it is, however, possible that trep-132 binds to nuclear re-

to regulate their expression in contexts other than the  xxxd3023xxx  response. in fact, the proximal sp1-binding regions of
the p21 and p27 gene promoters integrate different growth-

modulatory signals. for instance, the sp1 sites are involved in
the trans activation of the p21 promoter by transforming
growth factor ␤ (13) and brca1 (66, 72), which is also a
corepressor for the  xxxg730xxx , the  xxxg183xxx ,

and the pr (72). the proximal sp1 sites of the p27 promoter
are required for the response to  xxxd1682xxx  (33) and tamoxifen
(41). furthermore, the sp1-binding sites have a common important role in the modulation of the cell cycle (53). notably,
they also mediate the induction of  xxxg366xxx  by estrogens (7).
thus, further studies are warranted in order to analyze
whether trep-132 could play a more general role in the cross
talk of different growth signaling pathways.
we have recently shown that trep-132 expression levels are
positively associated with markers of cell differentiation in
human breast tumor biopsies (24). our present data further
demonstrate that trep-132 itself acts as a differentiation factor in breast epithelial cancer cells, notably in the mediation of
 xxxd3023xxx  effects. indeed, the presence of trep-132 was a
prerequisite for the early induction by  xxxd3023xxx  of certain
common differentiation markers (37), as well as for the  xxxd3023xxx -dependent increase in the synthesis of lipid droplets
which is associated with a differentiated secretory phenotype in
mammary cells (15). it is tempting to propose that p21 and p27
are involved in the trep-132-dependent effects on breast cancer cell differentiation. in fact, the induction of p21 and p27
has been shown to constitute a molecular switch that facilitates
hormone-induced differentiation in numerous cell systems

(34). in breast tissue, high levels of p21 and p27 are found in
intermediately differentiated and well-differentiated ductal
carcinoma in situ, respectively (47). furthermore, p27 up-regulation is thought to be the molecular basis for the blockage in
the alveolar differentiated state (58). thus, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the function of trep-132 in mammary
cell differentiation and the putative role of p21 and p27 induction therein remain to be investigated.
the role of pr activity on breast tumorigenesis has been the
subject of controversy. in epidemiological studies,  xxxd3023xxx  levels during a first pregnancy at an early age are thought
to confer protective effects against future breast tumor development (62). however, the possible deleterious effect of certain  xxxd2554xxx  used in hormone replacement therapies
(hrts) after menopause and as contraceptives to counteract
the proliferative action of unopposed estrogens on the uterus
recently resurfaced in the women’s health initiative and the
million women studies (6, 57). these studies showed that a
combined estrogen plus  xxxd3023xxx  regimen as hrt is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer compared to estrogen alone or placebo. in spite of these data, different reports have also indicated that the effects of  xxxd3023xxx  and
its derivatives may depend on several different factors, includ-

and to guide the future discovery of drugs. in fact, selective
 xxxg1737xxx  modulators inducing trep-132 cofactor recruitment to pr may prevent breast cancer development
when used in hrts, contraceptives, or treatment of uterine
diseases. further studies are thus warranted to evaluate the
putative tissue-specific roles of trep-132 in  xxxd3023xxx 
pathways.

ing the family history of breast cancer, the mode of administration (e.g., episodical or cyclical versus continuous), and the
dose and type of  xxxd2554xxx  (e.g., estrane or pregnane derivatives) (for reviews, see references 17, 36, and 61). the in vitro
demonstration of the delayed action of  xxxd3023xxx  derivatives on breast cancer cell proliferation could explain their
potential differential stimulatory or growth-inhibitory effects,
depending on whether the treatment is transitory or continuous, respectively (28, 50, 68). interestingly, sirna knockdown
of trep-132 did not modulate the influence of  xxxd3023xxx 
on the initial proliferative burst, as shown by facs analysis
(fig. 6a, left panel) or bromodeoxyuridine proliferation assays
(data not shown). in correlation with this, the induction after
6 h of  xxxd3023xxx  treatment of  xxxg366xxx , d3, a, b1, or e
gene expression, which participate in the immediate acceleration of cell cycle progression (28, 50, 68), was not affected by
trep-132 sirna transfection (data not shown). these data,
indicating a role for trep-132 specifically in the growth-inhibitory response to  xxxd3023xxx , suggest that the effects of each
 xxxd3023xxx  treatment may also depend on levels of trep-132
expression in breast epithelium and/or of trep-132 recruitment to the pr.
in clinical practice, the expression of pr in breast tumor
biopsies is assessed as a predictive marker for favorable disease
prognosis, with the absence of pr reflecting a nonfunctional
 xxxg730xxx  and resistance to hormone therapy (12, 32).
expression levels of pr correlate with p27 and differentiation
status in large populations of primary mammary tumors (25,
55). p27 mrna and protein levels in breast cancer biopsies
correlate positively with a favorable outcome in human breast
tumors, whereas a loss of p27 gene expression is associated
with a shorter overall survival (8, 25, 54). however, a subgroup
of steroid receptor-positive tumors with low levels of p27,
which are of poor prognosis and are resistant to antiestrogen
therapy, exists (4). it is tempting to speculate that an alteration
of the activity of transcriptional factors—such trep-132—
involved with pr in the (dys)regulation of the p27 gene promoter could play a role in p27 loss and mammary tumor development. it is noteworthy that breast tumor formation is
associated with a decrease in trep-132 gene expression (24).
moreover, the human trep-132 gene lies on the chromosome
6p21.1-p12.1 locus (14, 21, 59), for which allelic loss has been
shown to accompany the acquisition of tamoxifen resistance by
mcf-7 cells (1). analyses of potential correlations between
genetic alterations of the trep-132 gene and p27 expression
could be decisive in clarifying the role of trep-132 in familial
predisposition to certain cancers and/or failure of hormonal
therapy.
following tamoxifen, the first identified selective estrogen
receptor modulator, a number of other antiestrogens have
been developed (20). the notion that selective nuclear receptor modulators can exhibit cell- and tissue-specific effects has
also been extended to a panel of other nuclear receptors (64).
selective  xxxg1737xxx  modulators, such as asoprinil,
are now under investigation in the treatment of uterine fibroids
and endometriosis (10). however, to date, they have been
mostly identified by empirical and in vivo studies (10). the
characterization of trep-132 as a pr coregulator molecule
involved in the antiproliferative and differentiation effects of
 xxxd3023xxx  in breast tissue may have the potential to explain
