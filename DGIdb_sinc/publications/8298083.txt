neuropharmacology and neurotoxicology

d1azoxide (dzx) opens atp-sensitive k (k,7p) channels
in muscle and other cells. in whole-cell voltage-clamp re-
cordings in slices, in the presence of kynurenate and
bicuculline to minimize indirect effects, dzx (0.65 mm)
did not increase input conductance; but it sharply reduced
persistent inward and outward currents. an inward cur-
rent (peak near —20 mv) was especially clear in the pres-
ence of k channel blockers; was fully evident in
ca-channel blocking medium; but was abolished by tetro-
dotoxin. the main direct effects of dzx on these neurones
are thus mediated not by activation of k,,, channels, but
rather by modulation of voltage-dependent channels,
including a ttx-sensitive persistent na current and poss-
ibly a ca current.

introduction

because it quickly relaxes vascular smooth muscle,
 xxxd1868xxx  (dzx) has long been in use for the treatment
of acute hypertensive episodes.! a pronounced side-
effect is hyperglycaemia,? which is mainly due to
hyperpolarization of pancreatic insulin-secreting
cells—mediated by opening of atp-sensitive k (k,+p)
channels.>*

according to the few relevant studies,>” dzx does
not produce any comparable increase in k conduc-
tance (g,) of hippocampal ca3 pyramidal or granule
cells—either because they have no kap channels or
because these are insensitive to dzx (though dzx-
sensitive channels appear to be present in mossy fibre
terminals, where they may prevent anoxic glutamate
release).

dzx does not affect voltage-dependent currents of
insulin-secreting cells.* in hippocampal neurones, cro-
makalim (another activator of g, in muscle®) modu-
lates inward rectifiers, a delayed rectifier and a
d-current.'*? in view of the intense current interest in
the effects of dzx on ligand-gated channels,” the
possibility that dzx might also significantly affect
voltage-dependent currents needed investigating.

materials and methods

after decapitating adult sprague-dawley rats,
under full halothane anaesthesia, hippocampal slices
(450 wm) were cut with a vibroslicer (campden
instruments, loughborough, uk). they were then
kept for one hour, at room temperature, in oxygenated
(95% o, and 5% co,) artificial cerebrospinal fluid

(acsf) containing (in mm): nacl 124; kc13.0;  xxxg2125xxx ,
2.0; nah,po, 1.25; nahco, 26 and glucose 10. after
their transfer to the recording chamber, slices were just
submerged in flowing acsf (at 33°).

whole-cell recording was with 2.5-3 wm patch
electrodes, usually containing k methylsulphate
(150 mm), hepes (10 mm), mgcl, (1.0 mm),  xxxg2125xxx ,
(0.1 mm) and kegta (1.1 mm), the ph being
adjusted to 7.25 with koh; in most experiments,
1.0 mm atp was also added. electrodes had a resist-
ance of 3-5 m2. the voltage-clamping was done with
an axoclamp-2 (axon instruments, burlingame, ca)
operating in the discontinuous mode, taking the usual
precautions to maintain an optimal input frequency
response.

in some experiments, ca-dependent currents were
minimized by prolonged superfusion with a phos-
phate-free ‘mn/low ca’ acsf (containing 2.3 mm
mncl, and 0.4mm  xxxg2125xxx ,). bicuculline (bic), kyn-
urenic acid (kyn), carbachol, tetraethylammonium
chloride (tea) and  xxxd3394xxx  (from 100 mm stock
solution in 150 mm naoh) were all obtained from
sigma corporation (st louis, mi); tetrodotoxin (ttx)
was purchased from the qinhuangdao trading cor-
poration (china) and  xxxd1868xxx  from schering canada
inc. (montréal:  xxxd1868xxx  solution, 65 mm, at ph
11.6).

voltage-dependent currents were elicited either
with 0.5 s pulses (usually from a holding potential (v,,)
near —50 mv to suppress the depolarization-inacti-
vated a- and d-type currents) or with slowly-rising
depolarizing ramps (50 mvs“). in all cases, kyn
(1 mm) and bic (10 4m) were added to the acsf to
eliminate possible indirect effects mediated by dzx-
modulation of transmitter release or actions.§”!>"4

results

current/voltage (i/v) plots of the final, sustained
(‘steady-state’) value of evoked currents were charac-
terized by pronounced outward rectification (fig. 1a).
in standard acsf, the most obvious and consistent
effect of dzx bath applications (0.65 mm) was to
reduce the outward current, while producing no
increase in input conductance (cf. open and closed
circles in fig. 1a). all nine cells—six tested with pulses
and three with ramps—showed a sharp depression of
outward current by dzx (by 47.2%; s.e. + 10.2,
p < 0.01 for = 6).

dzx also appeared to block a sustained inward cur-
rent—normally masked by the prominent outward
current—but detectable upon closer inspection of the
region between —40 and 0 mv (after initial firing that
could not be adequately controlled by our voltage-
clamp (cf. inset traces in fig. 1b)). this inward current
was much enhanced by blocking gy with carbachol
and tea. its persistence after prolonged exposure to
“mn/low ca’ acsf strongly indicated that it is a na
(and not ca) current.

under these conditions, a zone of prominent nega-
tive slope appeared in the i/v plots (fig. 1b, open
circles). when dzx was applied (0.65 mm, as above),
the inward inflexion disappeared (fig. 1b, closed
circles). a similar inward current was evident in the

ramp-evoked i/v plots (control trace cnt in fig. 2a)
and was equally suppressed by dzx (not shown).
after these long applications of dzx, two cells
showed no recovery of outward or inward currents
after 15 min wash, as previously reported,® or after
adding  xxxd3394xxx  (1 mm).

in two experiments in ‘mn/low ca’ acsf, the
inward inflexion in ramp-evoked currents was practi-
cally abolished after adding ttx (1 4m), as in figure
2a: the persistent inward current blocked by ttx is
more directly illustrated by the difference current in
figure 2b, obtained by subtracting the “i'tx-treated’
from the control current. a more general suppression
of inward currents was suggested by three experi-
ments, performed in acsf containing ttx and k
channel blockers, in which presumed ca currents were
also much reduced by dzx (not shown).

discussion

the present findings show that there is very little
similarity between the effects of dzx on hippocampal
neurones and on non-neural structures, such as insu-
lin-secreting cells (and smooth muscle),? where dzx
causes a major increase in g,—mainly by opening kp
channels——but has no effect on voltage-dependent cur-
rents.® as in previous experiments on hippocampal

tive na current. voltage-clamp recording in ‘mn/low ca‘ acsf contain-
ing also kyn, bic, tea and carbachol (as in fig. 1b). a: currents were
elicited by depolarizing ramp (from -80 to 0 mv) illustrated in c; nega-

neurones,” there were only minimal changes in
input conductance. but dzx consistently depressed
voltage-dependent slowly-inactivating outward and
inward currents. the nature of the dzx-sensitive
outward current remains to be clarified. the dzx-sen-
sitive current includes a ttx-sensitive na current—
tentatively identified as the persistent na current
known to exist in hippocampal neurones'"—as well as
at least one ca current. owing to the limitations of our
voltage-clamp, we made no attempt to look for any
comparable depression of the fast na current.

conclusion

though showing little sign of activating k,7» chan-
nels,  xxxd1868xxx  has quite marked effects on voltage-
dependent, slowly-inactivating outward and inward
currents, which can be expected to modulate signifi-
cantly the firing behaviour of hippocampal (and per-
haps other cns) neurones.
