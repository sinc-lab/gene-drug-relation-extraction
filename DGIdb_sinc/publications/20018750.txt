although  xxxg1807xxx  (ppar␥)
agonists such as thiazolidinediones (tzds) are widely used to treat
type 2 diabetes, how its activation in individual tissues contributes to
tzd’s therapeutic action remains controversial. as tzds are known to
have receptor-independent effects, we sought to establish gain-offunction animal models to delineate the receptor’s insulin-sensitizing
actions. unexpectedly, we find that selective activation of ppar␥ in
adipocytes, but not in macrophages, is sufficient for whole-body
insulin sensitization equivalent to systemic tzd treatment. in addition
to improved adipokine, inflammatory, and lipid profiles, ppar␥ activation in mature adipocytes normalizes serum insulin without increased adipogenesis. co-culture studies indicated that ppar␥-activated adipocytes broadly suppress induction of inflammatory
cytokines and c-x-c family chemokines in macrophages. collectively,
these data describe an ‘‘adipocentric’’ model in which adipose activation of ppar␥ is sufficient for complete insulin sensitization and
suggest a specific application for fat selective ppar␥ modulators in
diabetic therapy.

t is increasingly recognized that adipose tissue is an active
metabolic and endocrine organ that impacts widely on wholebody homeostasis. one key factor in supporting the centrality of
adipose tissue in whole-body glucose metabolism is ppar␥, a
nuclear receptor that is critical both for adipocyte differentiation
and for maintenance of mature adipocytes (1, 2). ppar␥ was
shown to be critical both for adipocyte differentiation and for
maintenance of mature adipocytes (1, 3). thiazolidinediones
(tzds), the only class of insulin-sensitizing drugs in clinical use, are
high-affinity ligands for ppar␥ (2, 4, 5). two currently available
tzds, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are widely prescribed antidiabetic drugs. although ppar␥ is predominantly expressed in
adipose tissue (2), major tissues of insulin-responsive glucose
homeostasis include skeletal muscle and liver. while the complete
lack of ppar␥ leads to embryonic lethality (6), previous studies
that involve tissue specific deletion of ppar␥ have been confusing.
adipose-specific mouse knockouts of ppar␥, when fed a high-fat
diet, develop systemic insulin resistance (7, 8). lack of ppar␥ in
muscle, on the other hand, leads to muscle insulin resistance under
a normal chow diet (9, 10). in addition, it was recently reported that
macrophage-specific deletion of ppar␥ results in systemic insulin
resistance and glucose intolerance (11, 12). while these findings
point to the contribution of adipose and non-adipose ppar␥ in the
origin of insulin resistance, use of knockout models fails to address
how and where tzds act to promote insulin sensitization in
diabetic conditions, and whether the cellular targets of insulin
sensitivity are the same or different from those promoting insulin
resistance. moreover, it has been demonstrated that absence of
adipose ppar␥ can be compensated by increased gene expression
in liver (13) and muscle (14). to circumvent such complications
caused by the loss-of-function, we generated gain-of-function

ppar␥ models to investigate the role of the receptor in dietinduced insulin resistance. surprisingly, ppar␥ activation in adipocytes was sufficient to improve whole-body insulin sensitivity to
a degree similar to systemic tzd treatment. in addition to improved adipokine profiles and reduced serum lipids, adipose
ppar␥ activation suppressed high fat diet-induced inflammation
and dramatically lowered circulating insulin levels.
results
adipose-specific activation of ppar␥ increases whole-body insulin
sensitivity. to address the selective role of adipose in insulin

sensitization, transgenic mice were generated expressing a vp16ppar␥ fusion protein (vp␥) under the control of the ap2 promoter. vp␥ has been shown to regulate ppar␥ target genes
independent of ligand, and has no activity on response elements for
other nuclear receptors (15). in vitro, vp␥ efficiently up-regulated
a ppar response element (ppre) driven reporter in the absence
of ligand (fig. s1 a). the resulting transgenic (tg) mice were
found to express a level of the transgene similar to that of
endogenous levels of ppar␥ in white (wat) and brown (bat)
adipose tissues; no significant expression was detected in other
tissues (fig. s1b). while tzds can promote increased adipogenesis
and weight gain, the late adipogenic stage expression of the ap2
promoter restricts the transgene activity to nonproliferating mature
adipocytes (fig. s1c). thus, this strategy allows us to selectively
address the impact of a single cell type, (i.e., the mature adipocyte)
to insulin sensitization. by western blot, vp␥ band was detected in
adipose tissue from tg but not wild-type (wt) animals (fig. s1e).
under normal chow, tg mice exhibited apparently normal
growth and development of epididymal, perirenal, subcutaneous,
and brown adipose tissues, unaltered glucose excursion curves and
similar circulating lipids (table s1 and figs. s1f and s2 a and b).
this correlates with the observed lack of effect of tzds in insulin
sensitive lean subjects (16). to study the effects of adipose-specific
ppar␥ activation in the context of insulin resistance, animals were
fed high-fat diet (hfd) for 3 months. while the tg mice experienced a similar increase in wat mass and weight, the tg cohort
had lower fasting glucose levels compared to wt animals, indicating improved glucose metabolism (table s1). indeed, glucose
tolerance (gtt) and insulin tolerance (itt) tests revealed that tg
mice display significantly diminished glucose excursions and enauthor contributions: s.s., p.o., and r.m.e. designed research; s.s., p.o., d.d.s., m.s., a.r.a.,

hanced insulin sensitivity (fig. s1 g and h). compared to wt mice,
insulin levels in tg mice were dramatically diminished more than
3.5-fold on hfd (3.6 vs. 0.98 ng/ml) (fig. 1a) indicating that
selective activation of ppar␥ in adipocytes is protective against
diet-induced insulin resistance.
adipose ppar␥ activation has a comparable effect to tzd treatment.

these results prompted us to compare the therapeutic effect of
tzd treatment with adipose-specific ppar␥ activation in the
insulin resistant state. both wt and tg mice, fed hfd, were
treated with or without pioglitazone. while tzd treatment resulted in a 9–23% increase in body weight due to enhanced adipose
mass, tg groups did not show such an increase (table 1). importantly, this shows that activation of ppar␥ in mature adipocytes
does not promote proliferation. surprisingly, fasting glucose and
insulin levels were reduced to the same degree in tzd-treated and
tg groups (table 1). as shown in fig. 1 b and c, respectively, itt
and gtt indicated that both tzd-treated and transgenic animals

have comparably improved insulin sensitivities and glucose tolerance compared to nontreated controls. wt mice exhibited hyperinsulinemia during gtt, while tzd-treated and tg groups had
much lower levels of circulating insulin (fig. 1d), indicating that
both tzd treatment and adipose ppar␥ transgene expression
produced robust protection against insulin resistance. indeed, the
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (homa-ir), a
product of basal insulin and glucose concentrations, pointed to
similarly dramatic alleviation in insulin resistance by either tzd
treatment or adipose restricted ppar␥ activation (fig. 1e). hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed to further delineate whole body and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity and
glucose metabolism. the glucose infusion rates required to maintain euglycemia were dramatically increased in both tzd-treated
and tg mice (fig. 1f), indicating equivalent states of systemic
insulin sensitivity. glucose disposal rates, which primarily occur
through muscle, were enhanced in tzd and tg groups (fig. 1g).

in addition, the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose
production during the clamp was significantly increased in tzd and
tg animals (fig. 1 h and i). as with the gir, the gdr showed
the greatest improvement in the tg cohort. interestingly, tzd
treatment did not further improve insulin sensitization in tg mice,
raising the question as to whether direct action of tzds in muscle
or liver is necessary. together, these results clearly demonstrate that
adipose-restricted ppar␥ activation is as effective as tzd treatment in reversing systemic insulin resistance.
consistent with the above observations, circulating free fatty
acid, triglycerides, leptin, and  xxxg1940xxx  levels were significantly reduced in both tzd-treated and tg mice (table 1). in contrast,
levels of adiponectin and resistin significantly changed only with
tzd treatment. although diet-induced obesity is known to cause
adipocyte hypertrophy and leukocyte infiltration in wat (17–20),
adipocytes from tg wat were smaller in size and greater in
number per unit area than those from either wt or tzd-treated
wt wat (fig. 2a). similarly, brown adipocytes from tg mice
were smaller and contained markedly less lipids (fig. 2b). in
addition, both tzd treatment and adipose ppar␥ activation led
to a significant reduction in macrophage specific cd68-positive
cells in wat (fig. 2c) and a remarkable secondary improvement
in hepatic steatosis in tg mice (fig. s2c). these improvements in
adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation emphasize that critical
systemic benefits of tzds can be achieved by selective activation of
the adipocentric ppar␥ gene network.

adipose ppar␥ influences lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, insulin
signaling, and inflammatory genes. as the vp␥ transgene and tzd

treatment had similar but not identical effects, a comparison of their
molecular targets may offer insights into the genetic mechanisms
underlying insulin sensitization. we compared expression profiles
in wat from four hfd-fed cohorts, including wt, wt⫹tzd,
tg, and tg⫹tzd mice. fold change was calculated against the
transcript levels of the wt group. the results from wat revealed
significantly altered expression in a large cluster of genes in tzdtreated and tg mice (dataset s1). among them, 1,080 transcripts
were up-regulated and 723 down-regulated in all three groups (fig.
3a). gene ontology annotations of the combined 1,803 gene set
showed significantly enriched functional categories, which include
lipid and fatty acid metabolism, carboxylic acid and glucose metabolism, intracellular signaling, immune response, and lymphocyte
activation (fig. 3b). interestingly, the majority of ‘‘immune system
response’’ genes showed down-regulation, while nearly all ‘‘carboxylic acid metabolism’’ genes were up-regulated (fig. 3c). in contrast, the ‘‘lipid metabolic process’’ category included a balance of
both down-regulated (e.g.,  xxxg1938xxx , apoa4, and agpat4) and upregulated (e.g., fabp4/ap2, cd36,  xxxg2014xxx , dgat1, and pten) genes.
unexpectedly, several genes in the ‘‘other’’ category include components of the insulin signaling cascade such as  xxxg1198xxx ,  xxxg1199xxx , pi3k p85,
and glut4, all of which were significantly increased. in addition,
liver (fig. s3a) and muscle (fig. s3b) were examined in wt and
tg groups. although the numbers of gene changes were substantially smaller than those in wat (fig. s3c and dataset s2), a major
gene category that was significantly enriched in these tissues is
related to metabolism, inflammatory, and immune regulatory
processes. these results prove that the constitutive adipose transgene is as effective as tzd treatment in activating and repressing
target genes, and they identify a subset (red genes in fig. 3a) that
closely track insulin sensitivity.
to complement the findings observed in the microarray analysis,
real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) was performed for several key
factors in wat (fig. 4a). ppar␥ and established ppar target
genes such as ap2,  xxxg1337xxx  (lpl), pepck, cd36, and
 xxxg434xxx  were all increased in tzd-treated or tg animals (fig. 4a
and fig. s4a). unexpectedly, there was no additive effect on these
genes in tzd-treated tg mice. enhanced expression of key factors
playing roles in the insulin signaling pathway, including  xxxg1198xxx ,  xxxg1199xxx ,
glut4, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k), and  xxxg1194xxx , but not akt, was found in both tzd-treated and tg groups,
supporting the microarray results (fig. 4a). up-regulation of  xxxg1198xxx 
and  xxxg1199xxx  was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis (fig. s4b).
inflammatory mediators tnf␣,  xxxg357xxx , and mip1␣, and macrophage markers f4/80 and cd68 exhibited modest decreases in
expression (fig. s4a). these results suggest that adipose ppar␥
activation may act to limit the inflammatory response in this tissue.
ppar␥ activation in adipocytes controls inflammatory processes in
macrophages. it was reported that ap2 is expressed in the macro-

phage and its expression enhanced by cell activation (21). this
finding leaves the possibility that the receptor can also be activated
in macrophages in the tg mice and that insulin sensitization could
be contributed by these cells. to investigate this possibility, stromal
vascular fractions (svf) and adipocytes (ac) were separated from
adipose tissue, and the macrophage population (svf-m␾) was
enriched from svf. a control experiment confirmed enrichment of
an adipocyte marker in the ac and macrophage markers in the
svf-m␾ (fig.  xxxg1865xxx ). the results showed that svf-m␾ had very
little expression of the transgene, ppar␥, or ap2 compared to ac
when fed a normal diet or hfd (fig. s5b). to directly address the
role of ppar␥ in macrophages, we created an additional mouse
model named ‘‘mtg’’ in which the transgene expression is driven
under the control of a macrophage-specific cd68 promoter (22).
the transgene is selectively and highly expressed in bone marrowderived and peritoneal macrophages (fig. s6a). among different

tissues examined, adipose tissue was found to contain substantial
macrophage-specific transgene expression (fig. s6b). in wat from
mtg mice, svf-m␾, but not ac, exhibited induction of transgene,
ppar␥, and ap2 expression; hfd feeding increased their expression in svf-m␾, indicating more infiltration of this cell type (fig.
s6c). nevertheless, mtg mice had no significant difference in body
weight, lipid profiles, fasting glucose, and glucose excursion curves
when they were fed either a normal diet or hfd (fig. s7). this
suggests that activation of ppar␥ in macrophages under diet-

induced obesity does not improve whole body glucose metabolism.
collectively, although we do not exclude the notion that macrophages per se can play a role in systemic insulin sensitization,
macrophage ppar␥ is not expected to be a major contributor to
the phenotype observed in our ap2-driven transgenic animals.
to explore the mechanism at the cellular level as to how
inflammatory genes are down-regulated in the tg mice, a coculture system was used to examine whether ppar␥ activation in
adipocytes modulates the inflammatory function of leukocytes. we
found that lipopolysaccharide (lps)-activated raw264.7 macrophages suppress ppar␥, its target genes such as ap2, and insulin
signaling components including  xxxg1198xxx  and glut4 in 3t3-l1 preadipocytes (fig. s8a). in contrast, stable expression of ppar␥ in 3t3-l1
cells reciprocally suppresses expression of lipopolysaccharide (lps)induced inflammatory and chemokine factors, including il-6, tnf␣
and  xxxg357xxx  in macrophages, which is further repressed by adipocyte
differentiation (fig. s8b). adipocytic ppar␥ did not alter il-4
induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. among the
genes that are significantly repressed by tzds and the transgene in
the microarray studies above include the c-x-c family of chemokines. qpcr indicated that  xxxg561xxx ,  xxxg559xxx , and cxcl16 are
dramatically repressed by ppar␥ activated wat in vivo (fig. 4b).
this repression was further supported by the in vitro experiment
that adipocytic ppar␥ activation reduces lps-mediated induction
of  xxxg561xxx ,  xxxg559xxx , and cxcl16 in macrophages (fig. 4b). thus,
adipocyte ppar␥ itself is anti-inflammatory, counteracting mac-

rophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory activities, presumably by
the release of one or more secreted factors.
adipocyte ppar␥ activation modulates insulin signaling. enhanced
expression of important insulin signaling components in the experiments above prompted us to further investigate its key player, akt
(23). although akt did not change at the transcriptional level (fig.
4a), basal phosphorylation of akt on ser-473, an indicator of akt
activation, is higher in wat from both tzd-treated and tg mice
and this enhanced akt activity was further exaggerated during the
insulin infusion (fig. 4c). similarly, in muscle, akt activation was
enhanced in the presence of insulin in tg mice as well as tzdtreated wt mice. taken together with the gene expression studies
above, we conclude that either tzd treatment or transgenic
ppar␥ activation improves insulin sensitivity by increasing expression and posttranslational activation of key insulin signaling components in adipose tissue.
adipose-selective ppar␥ agonists may be the best insulin sensitizers.

based on the results above, we hypothesized that compounds that
act more effectively on adipose ppar␥ than others should also
confer greater insulin sensitizing effects. to test this hypothesis, we
compared the physiological and gene expression effects of four
ppar␥ ligand treatments in zucker fatty rats using the tzds
pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone, and the non-tzd
ag035029 (24). as expected, each of the ppar␥ ligand treatments
improved the insulin sensitivity profiles of the rats compared to
untreated controls (table s2). insulin sensitization occurred with
tissue-associated phenotypes, for example, improved gdr (muscle), hgp suppression (liver), and suppression of plasma ffas
(adipose tissue) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies.
the ppar␥ ligand treatments also resulted in significant gene
expression changes in muscle, liver and adipose tissue (table 2).
although each was insulin-sensitizing, the ppar␥ ligands exhibited
distinct physiology and gene expression altering efficacy profiles.
for example, ag035029 was the most potent insulin sensitizer and
the most efficient inducer of differential gene expression in adipose
tissue. in contrast, troglitazone and rosiglitizone were most effective in altering liver and muscle genes. thus, superior efficacy of
ag035029 in adipose tissue is correlated with superior insulinsensitizing activity.
discussion
in this report, we show that ppar␥ activation in adipose tissue is
sufficient to explain the body wide insulin-sensitizing actions of
tzds. activation of ppar␥ in adipocytes, but not in macrophages,
leads to significant increases in glucose disposal rates in muscle and

suppression of hepatic glucose production, and reverses systemic
hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. these results support our
‘‘adipocentric’’ model where fat is not only a contributor but a
central player in diabetes-associated insulin sensitization. two
mechanisms have been proposed to explain how adipocytes contribute to the maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis (2).
one is by the release of insulin-sensitizing adipose-derived hormones or adipokines, while the other is through the sequestering of
excess  xxxd2154xxx  and triglycerides that induce insulin resistance (25,
26). our studies reveal that ppar␥ activated adipocytes display
enhanced responsiveness to insulin, and exert potent repressive
functions on macrophage activation. these multiple mechanisms
are not mutually exclusive. for instance, some adipokines and lipids
can work as anti-inflammatory mediators, and their release may
depend on the insulin signaling state of adipocytes.
there are several advantages to the transgenic strategy used in
this study. first, the ppar␥ transgene allows us to study receptorspecific functions in absence of ligands such as tzds which are
known to harbor receptor-independent activities (27). second,
since we made use of the ap2 promoter to drive adipose-specific
expression, this results in expression of the transgene in mature
adipocytes, but not in preadipocytes, as ap2 is expressed after
adipogenesis has been initiated. stimulation of adipogenesis by
tzds results in the complication of weight gain, yet can be
beneficial by enabling fat to store more lipids and lower circulating
free  xxxd2154xxx  (5). however, previously it has not been possible to
determine whether insulin-sensitizing effects of tzd depend on
adipogenesis per se (28). our data argue that ppar␥ activation in
mature adipocytes, but not in preadipocytes, is sufficient to dramatically improve insulin sensitivity without increased adipogenesis. this provides direct genetic support to the observations that
several selective ppar␥ modulators (sparms) can improve insulin sensitivity without causing weight gain (29). this may reflect
an ability of these compounds to regulate receptor activity more
selectively in mature adipocytes, possibly through differential corepressor dismissal and coactivator recruitment.
although tzds are often referred to as ‘‘insulin sensitizers,’’
little evidence has been presented as to how ppar␥ increases the
ability of target cells to sense insulin. we identify several insulin
signaling components including  xxxg1198xxx  and glut4 as being upregulated in tzd-treated and tg mice. another central regulator
of insulin signaling, akt, is highly activated by insulin in ppar␥activated adipose tissue. reduction of insulin-signaling activities in
adipocytes is associated with systemic insulin resistant states (30,
31). this suggests that activation of adipocytic insulin signaling
pathway observed following systemic tzd treatment or adipocyte
sugii et al.

ppar␥ activation is a bona fide indicator of improved insulin
sensitivity in the whole body.
in addition, the finding that a number of immune response or
inflammatory genes were found to be down-regulated in wat can
explain further mechanisms of insulin sensitization. we demonstrate that adipocytic ppar␥ activation acts to limit the inflammatory response in this tissue. this suppression may be secondary
to the induction of repressors such as ncor. recent studies
demonstrated that macrophage ppar␥ plays an important role in
whole body insulin sensitization and glucose homeostasis (11, 12).
it was reported that ap2 is expressed in the macrophage and its
expression enhanced by cell activation (21). our studies find that
resident macrophages from wat exhibited very limited expression
of the transgene and ppar␥/ap2 compared to adipocytes. furthermore, a separate model of macrophage-selective ppar␥ activation failed to improve diet-induced insulin resistance. thus, while
we do not exclude the possibility that macrophages per se play a role
in systemic insulin sensitization, macrophage ppar␥ is not reasonably expected to be a major contributor to the phenotype
observed in our adipose-selective mouse model. recently, it was
reported that an increase of cxcl5, a member of c-x-c family
chemokines, in adipose resident macrophages is correlated with
obesity-associated insulin resistance (32). while we did not find
involvement of cxcl5 in our models, other members of the family
including  xxxg561xxx ,  xxxg559xxx , and cxcl16 are significantly suppressed by adipocytic ppar␥ activation. these data indicate that
adipocytes themselves possess anti-inflammatory functions and
modulate macrophage infiltration and activities, which may otherwise exacerbate the insulin resistant state.
in conclusion, we demonstrate that adipose-specific activation of
ppar␥ is sufficient for reversing whole body insulin resistance to
a similar degree as systemic tzd treatment. supporting this notion
is that the non-tzd agonist ag035029, which has the greatest adipose
specificity, exhibits the most potent insulin sensitizing activities.
recent concerns over adverse side effects by rosiglitazone, one of
the two tzds in the market, reveal that we do not fully understand
how this drug works (33). our results suggest that it may be possible
to dissociate the benefits from the complications and newer classes

physiology

tg animals were generated by placing vp16-ppar␥ downstream of the ap2
promoter and upstream of the sv40 poly(a) sequence. founders were identified
by pcr and southern blotting (fig. s1d), then backcrossed to c57bl/6j animals for
more than four generations. mtg animals were generated by placing the vp16ppar␥ transgene downstream of the human cd68 promoter (22) and betaglobin intron, and upstream of woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (wpre) and sv40 poly(a). the transgene was injected into an inbred
c57bl/6j strain. control animals that only express the vp16 domain were also
generated and were phenotypically identical to wild-type (34). for dna microarray analysis, rna was pooled from six mice or from two rats in each group.
samples from each group were labeled and hybridized to affymetrix mouse
genome 430 2.0 (n ⫽ 2 each group) or rat 230a (n ⫽ 3 each) arrays. functional
annotations such as gene ontology (go) were made using the vampire microarray analysis suite or david bioinformatics resources. qpcr analyses using sybr
green dye (invitrogen) were run in triplicate and expression was normalized to
the levels of the housekeeping control  xxxg861xxx . for phosphorylation assays,
tissues intraportally infused with humulin at 0.5 units/kg for 5 min were homogenized and their protein extracts were analyzed for phosphorylation levels of akt
using bio-plex phosphoprotein detection kits (bio-rad). in vitro transfection
assay, metabolic measurements, histology, separation of different adipose cell
types, and co-culture studies are described in si text. unless noted, statistical
comparisons were made using student’s t test. error bars of the graphs are
presented as mean ⫾ sem. to identify genes differentially regulated by various
ppar␥ ligands, anova was conducted on muscle, liver and adipose tissue microarray expression data from zucker fatty rats treated for 21 days with
ag035029 (24), pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, or troglitazone. tukey’s post-hoc
tests were conducted to determine significant gene expression differences between pairs of treatment groups. significance was evaluated after anova and
tukey analyses using a cutoff p value of 0.05.
