purpose: we determined the response rate to and safety of a dual 5␣-reductase
inhibitor, dutasteride, in men with castration recurrent prostate cancer.
materials and methods: a total of 28 men with asymptomatic castration recurrent prostate cancer were treated with 3.5 mg dutasteride daily (luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone treatment continued), and evaluated monthly for
response and toxicity. eligibility included appropriate duration antiandrogen
withdrawal, baseline prostate specific antigen 2.0 ng/ml or greater and a new
lesion on bone scan, increase in measurable disease using response evaluation
criteria in solid tumors criteria, or 2 or more consecutive prostate specific
antigen measurements increased over baseline. outcomes were progression, stable disease, partial response (prostate specific antigen less than 50% of enrollment for 4 or more weeks) or complete response.
results: there were 25 evaluable men with a mean age of 70 years (range 57 to
88), a mean prostate specific antigen of 61.9 ng/ml (range 5.0 to 488.9) and mean
gleason score 8 (range 6 to 10), 15 of whom had bone metastases. eight men had
10 grade 3 or higher adverse events using national cancer institute common
terminology criteria, all of which were judged to be unrelated to treatment. of
the 25 men 14 had disease progression by 2 months, 9 had stable (2.5, 3, 3, 4, 4,
5, 5, 8.5, 9 months) disease, 2 had a partial response and none had a complete
response. overall median time to progression was 1.87 months (range 1 to 10,
95% ci 1.15–3.91).
conclusions: dutasteride rarely produces biochemical responses in men with
castration recurrent prostate cancer. however, further study is warranted given
its favorable safety profile.
key words: dutasteride; prostatic neoplasms; clinical trial, phase ii; prostate
cancer is the most common
noncutaneous malignancy of american men. the initial treatment for
those in whom local therapy fails or
metastasis develops is androgen deprivation therapy. invariably prostate cancer recurs and treatment options are limited.
castration recurrent prostate cancer is often referred to as androgen

independent or hormone refractory.
however, high levels of expression of
the  xxxg183xxx  and androgen
receptor regulated genes suggest a
continued role for the  xxxg183xxx  in prostate cancer recurrence.1 dihydrotestosterone, the preferred  xxxg183xxx  ligand, is produced

dutasteride for castration recurrent prostate cancer

inantly by the enzyme 5␣-reductase type ii. however, in castration recurrent prostate cancer the 5␣reducing capacity switches toward type i isozyme.2
furthermore, castration recurrent prostate cancer
tissue has dht levels sufficient for  xxxg183xxx  transactivation whether measured using radioimmunoassay or mass spectrometry.2,3 these findings suggest that dutasteride, which inhibits both
isozymes of 5␣r, may be useful in castration recurrent prostate cancer. finasteride, which primarily
inhibits the type ii isozyme, infrequently produces
remission in castration recurrent prostate cancer.4
dutasteride is well tolerated and safe in men with
lower urinary tract symptoms but its safety in men
with castration recurrent prostate cancer remains
unclear.5 in this study we determined the safety of
and response rate to dutasteride in men with castration recurrent prostate cancer.

an exact 1-stage design was used to evaluate efficacy.
since the median ttp after cytotoxic chemotherapy (docetaxel) in this setting was 10 months, the primary efficacy analysis based on this historical control involved a
2-sided test of the null hypothesis that the 10-month probability of progression was 50%.8 the alternative was that
the rate was less than or greater than 50%. a 1-sample
binomial test was used to determine if the rate of patients
without treatment failure  xxxd1891xxx  months was different from
50%. the upper bound on the type i error was set to be
0.05. sample size was determined such that the lower
bound of the statistical power for correctly concluding a
difference in ttp exists was 0.80 if the true 10-month
progression rate was 80% or greater, or 23% or less. the
overall survival and estimated progression-free survival
distribution were obtained using the kaplan-meier
method. statistical analysis was performed using sas®
9.1.3.

results
materials and methods
a total of 28 men with asymptomatic prostate cancer
progression despite medical ( xxxg930xxx  agonist with or without antiandrogen) or surgical castration were enrolled in
an institutional review board approved phase ii study.
the prostate specific antigen working group definition of
progressive disease was used for eligibility, that is 1)
increased size of measurable lesions on radiographic study
using recist, 2) new lesion on bone scan, or 3) 2 successive increases in psa measured at least 1 week apart.6,7
no minimum increase in psa was required. other eligibility criteria included serum psa 2.0 ng/ml or greater,
appropriate duration of antiandrogen cessation (28 days
or greater for  xxxd2143xxx , 42 days or greater for biclutamide
or  xxxd2725xxx ), and eastern cooperative oncology group
performance status 2 or less. psa doubling time was calculated using 3 or more values.
dutasteride was administered daily at 3.5 mg until
intolerable toxicity or evidence of disease progression. all
patients were monitored with physical examinations and
laboratory studies which included serum psa at the initiation of therapy and every 4 weeks thereafter. toxicity
was graded using the nci common toxicity criteria.
after entry into the study disease progression was defined by any of 4 criteria, namely 1) appearance of new
lesions suspicious for metastatic disease on bone scan, 2)
increase in radiographically measurable disease using
recist, 3) greater than 25% increase in serum psa
compared to baseline or posttreatment nadir, whichever
was lower, and increase 5.0 ng/ml or greater, or 4) development of symptoms directly related to prostate cancer.
complete response to treatment required disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease and normalization of
psa (less than 0.2 ng/ml on 2 successive determinations).
partial response was a greater than 50% decrease in serum psa that persisted 4 or more weeks, or a 30% or
greater decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all
metastatic target lesions using recist. disease was considered stable if it did not meet the criteria for progression, or partial or complete response.

a total of 28 patients were enrolled in the study
between february 2005 and february 2007 at roswell park cancer institute (23) and louisiana
state university health sciences center (5). two
patients were lost to followup due to hurricane katrina and 1 declined participation after enrollment.
mean age of the 25 evaluable subjects was 70 years
(range 57 to 88), mean gleason score was 8 (range 6
to 10) and 15 had bone metastases. fourteen (56%)
patients met the eligibility criteria for progressive
disease because of psa progression only, and 11
(44%) met the criteria of psa progression and new
lesions on bone scan. no patient met eligibility criteria because of recist. at entry mean baseline
psa was 61.9 ng/ml (range 5.0 to 488.9). mean and
median pre-entry psa doubling times were 8 and 4
months, respectively, with a range of – 4 to 68.
nine (36%) patients had undergone prior single
modality local therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy), and 7 (28%) had undergone radical
prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy. the remaining 9 (36%) patients had been treated only with
androgen deprivation therapy. prior systemic treatments consisted of only  xxxg930xxx  agonists for 1 (4%)
patient,  xxxg930xxx  agonists and antiandrogens for 19
(76%), and orchiectomy and antiandrogens for 2
(8%). the remaining 3 patients (12%) were treated
with  xxxg930xxx  agonists and antiandrogens plus ketoconazole and prednisone (1 patient), dexamethasone
and intravenous calcitriol (1 patient), and dexamethasone, fulvestran and intravenous calcitriol (1
patient).
eight men experienced 10 grade 3 or higher adverse events using nci criteria. all of these events

median ttp was 1.87 months (range 1 to 10, 95%
ci 1.15–3.91) (fig. 1). fourteen patients (56%) had
disease progression within 2 months, 9 (36%) had
stable disease for a mean of 5 months (range 3 to 9)
(fig. 2) and 2 (8%) had a partial response for a mean
of 8 months (range 6 to 11). the 95% ci based on the
binomial distribution for the partial response rate
was 0.001 to 0.204. no patient had a complete response. the 10-month progression rate was 96%.
there was a significant difference in median time to
progression compared to docetaxel (p ⬍0.05). at a
median followup of 25 months 8 of 14 patients with
progression had died (57%), 2 of 9 patients with
stable disease had died (22%) and no patients with
partial response had died (fig. 3). the 25th percen-

discussion
until the last decade most clinicians believed that
cytotoxic chemotherapy had no role in the management of castration recurrent prostate cancer.9 since
then mitoxantrone and docetaxel have shown some
benefit in this setting.10 docetaxel produced a median survival advantage of approximately 2 months,
and was granted food and drug administration approval for castration recurrent prostate cancer. unfortunately cytotoxic chemotherapy has important
side effects. men with castration recurrent prostate
cancer who are asymptomatic are less likely to accept such toxic therapies especially when cancer recurrence is manifested only biochemically. the identification of less toxic therapies for such men would
have obvious benefits.
the current study revealed no toxicities that were
considered related to dutasteride. men with castra-

tion recurrent prostate cancer experienced the well
documented safety profile of this drug. the grade iii
toxicities that were observed were likely related to
underlying disease processes or medical comorbidities. dutasteride has been administered at doses up
to 40 mg per day for 7 days without significant
adverse effects, and at doses of 5 mg daily for 6
months with a safety profile similar to the 0.5 mg
dose used clinically.11,12 in the current study a dose
of 3.5 mg was chosen to maximize efficacy while
maintaining ease of administration since 3.5 mg
capsules were available.
no complete responses to dutasteride were found
using the criteria adopted a priori. overall the partial response rate was 8%. response rates this low
are usually considered of no interest. five men with
stable disease showed no evidence of psa decrease
and had psa doubling times sufficiently long that
stable disease criteria were met because of the time
required for psa to increase 25% and 5 ng/ml or
more as per the arbitrary progression criteria. however, 4 men with stable disease appeared to have
some biochemical response to dutasteride (fig. 2).
larger studies would help clarify what percentage of
men with stable disease has a clinically meaningful
reduction in psa increase.
currently available secondary hormonal therapies have modest response rates but more significant side effects. ketoconazole demonstrated a partial response rate of 27% in patients with castration
recurrent prostate cancer. however, 21% of patients
experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment related side effects.13 corticosteroids demonstrated a partial response in 20% to 30% of patients with a median
response duration of 4 months.14 steroids are wellknown to cause poor wound healing, skin changes,
and alterations in body fat, fluid retention, weight

gain and hypertension. in another study diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen, had a 21% response
rate in castration recurrent prostate cancer. diethylstilbestrol related toxicities include thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke or pulmonary embolism) and gynecomastia.15 in comparison
to these agents dutasteride demonstrated a lower
response rate, but in light of its more favorable side
effect profile dutasteride may still be a potentially
better initial choice among secondary hormonal
agents for those patients with asymptomatic castration recurrent prostate cancer.
ly320236, another dual 5␣r inhibitor, also demonstrated activity in castration recurrent prostate
cancer. in a phase ii study of 51 men with advanced
prostate cancer 4 of 15 (27%) men with castration
recurrent prostate cancer had a greater than 50%
decrease in serum psa that persisted 56 to 1,000⫹
weeks.16 ly320236 was well tolerated in the study
with only 3 of 51 patients experiencing reversible
nci grade 3-4 toxicity (diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes), although drug development was later discontinued due to its teratogenicity. however, using
the same response criteria only 2 of 25 men (8%)
responded to dutasteride in the current study. most
men in both studies did not experience a biochemical
or radiographic response.
the reason for the limited response to dual 5␣r
inhibitors in castration recurrent prostate cancer is
unclear. the expression of  xxxg183xxx  regulated growth genes may continue because of
accumulation of testosterone, which activates the
 xxxg183xxx , but not as well as dht or aromatization of testosterone to estrogen, which may
activate mutant androgen receptors.17–20 in the
ly320236 study the serum estradiol level was below
the limit of detection before treatment but increased
to 17.8 and 30.0 pg/ml after the 250 and 500 mg
doses, respectively. testosterone and dht levels did

625

not change appreciably with treatment. therefore,
inhibition of 5␣r activity may increase formation of
estradiol by favoring aromatization of androgens in
lieu of reduction.
the current study had several limitations. as a
phase ii study the number of patients recruited was
small. a larger trial is needed to test the ability of
dutasteride to induce biochemical and radiographic
response in patients with castration recurrent prostate cancer. in addition, patients in this study received a variable number, and nonstandardized dose
and duration of prior cancer treatments including
radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy and systemic therapy. what effect these treatments had on
the response to dutasteride was unclear. the duration of prior systemic treatments was also not
known for all patients. the frequency of psa tests
(every 4 weeks) could have increased the chance of
laboratory error since frequent measurement may
capture individual biological variation and not biochemical progression. lastly, the true response rate
to dutasteride may have been influenced by the arbitrary definition of stable disease. of the 9 men
with stable disease 5 had baseline psa doubling
times such that psa may not have increased by 25%
and 5 ng/ml even without treatment. they may have
been labeled as having stable disease although
dutasteride truly had no effect. furthermore, since
5␣r inhibition amounts to hormonal manipulation
of androgens and psa is influenced by androgens,
the meaning of decreased psa in patients with stable disease is unclear.

conclusions
dutasteride rarely produces biochemical responses
in men with castration recurrent prostate cancer.
however, further study is warranted given its favorable safety profile.
