of a1-adrenergic receptors via systemic administration of drugs such as phenylpropanolamine (ppa) and  xxxd1707xxx  results
in the suppression of feeding in rats. whether ppa acts via activation of the three currently identified a1-adrenoceptor
subtypes is unknown. the intent of the present study was thus to examine the effects of systemic administration of the novel
a1a-adrenoceptor antagonist rs-17053 on ppa-induced anorexia. adult male rats ( n56 to 8 per group) were pretreated
(ip) with either 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, or 10.0 mg/kg rs-17053 or with 2.0 mg/kg of the prototypical a1-adrenoceptor antagonist
 xxxd3000xxx . five minutes later, each rat was treated (ip) with either 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg ppa. food and water intakes were
recorded for a 30 min period starting 10 min after the treatment injection. rats pretreated with vehicle and then treated
with ppa exhibited a dose-dependent suppression of feeding with a maximal effect evident at the 15 mg/kg dose of ppa.
pretreatment with 2.0 mg/kg  xxxd3000xxx  reversed the anorexic activity of ppa. pretreatment with rs-17053 (0.1–2.5 mg/kg)
did not alter either baseline feeding or the anorexic action of ppa. these results suggest that ppa does not act via the
a1a-adrenergic receptor subtype to suppress food intake.  1997 elsevier science inc.

the a1-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  does not parse the
receptor subtypes in that each exhibits high affinity for this
general a1-antagonist. yet, the subtypes can be distinguished
on the basis of function, relative binding of pharmacological
probes, and cloning sequences (5,6,9). a limited number of
probes have been identified that selectively antagonize the
a1a-adrenoceptor subtype. the novel compound rs-17053,
for example, has been recently shown to exhibit selectivity
for the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype (6) over the a1b- and a1dadrenoceptor subtypes (6,7), and to functionally antagonize
a1a-adrenoceptors located within rat kidney (6).
whether the anorexic action of ppa is specifically associated with activity at one or more of the a1-adrenoceptor
subtypes is unknown. the present study therefore sought to
determine whether pretreatment with the a1a-antagonist rs17053 (0.1–10 mg/kg) would reverse the anorexic action of
systemically administered ppa (5–15 mg/kg). doses of rs17053 and of ppa were chosen to encompass a full dose range
(1,10,16). in addition, 2.0 mg/kg  xxxd3000xxx  (ip) served as a
positive control condition, in that this  xxxd3000xxx  dose was noted

phenylpropanolamine (ppa) has been used for decades as an over-the-counter drug intended to suppress appetite in persons wanting to lose moderate amounts of weight.
the anorexic efficacy of ppa has been established (8,11,16,
18), but only recently has a distinct mechanism been proposed
to account for the anorexic property of ppa. the anorexic
action of ppa is thought to result from its efficacy as an
a1-adrenergic receptor agonist (18). pharmacological studies
have demonstrated that ppa binds to and activates a1-adrenergic receptors (12,14). systemic administration of other
a1-adrenergic agonists including  xxxd1707xxx  (3), amidephrine
(13) or skf 89748 (13) suppresses food intake in rats. finally,
the anorexic action of systemically administered ppa or  xxxd1707xxx  is reversed by systemic pretreatment with the general
a1-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  (17).
the aforementioned findings support the notion that ppa
suppresses food intake via activation of a1-adrenoceptors,
but do not indicate whether ppa acts via one of the currently
identified a1-adrenoceptor subtypes. the a1-adrenoceptor
is comprised of three subtypes, labelled a1a, a1b, and a1d. (5,9).

methods

subjects
the subjects were 185 male sprague–dawley viral-free albino rats (obtained from harlan industries; houston, tx)
weighing approximately 275–300 g at the beginning of the
study. the rats were housed individually in standard plastic
rodent cages in a colony room maintained at 21.0 6 18c under
a 12 h/12 h illumination schedule (lights on at 0700 h). the
rats were provided continuous access to tap water and to
rodent pellets (teklad) in the home cage.
drugs
a vehicle solution was prepared using tween 80 (3 drops
per ml) dissolved in sterile distilled water. rs-17053 solutions
were prepared by dissolving rs-17053 (rs: 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and
10 mg/ml) into the vehicle. rs-17053 was kindly donated by
dr. david e. clarke of roche bioscience corporation (palo
alto, ca). the phenylpropanolamine solutions (5, 10 and
15 mg/ml) were prepared using ppa hydrochloride (6-norephedrine: sigma chemical) dissolved in the vehicle. a solution of  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride (2 mg/ml: sigma chemical) was
similarly prepared. all solutions were prepared as the weight
of the base and salt in vehicle solution.
procedure
the rats were maintained in the colony room for a minimum of one week prior to the start of the experiment to
acclimate them to daily handling and routine colony procedures. each rat underwent a series of baseline feeding trials.
beginning at 1500 h each day, each rat was provided with a
clean cage with a cardboard pad placed beneath a metal grid
floor. the feeders and water bottles were removed, and each
rat was weighed prior to the start of its feeding trial. one
hour later, approximately 12 g of the pellet diet was placed
on the grid floor of each home cage and each water bottle
was weighed and returned to the home cage. each rat was
allowed 30 min access to the pellet diet and water. following
each feeding trial, the remaining food and spillage was removed from the cage, and weighed to determine individual
food intake (to the nearest 0.1 g). water intakes were measured to the nearest 0.1 ml. rats had continuous access to
food and water until the start of the next ingestive trial on
the following day.
on days 8, 9 and 10, each rat received separate vehicle
injections (1.0 ml/kg, ip), with one injection given at 15 min
prior to and the second injection given  xxxd1891xxx  min prior to the
feeding trial. these vehicle injections served to adapt the rats
to the injection protocol used during the drug trial.
the baseline intake trials on days 8–10 were averaged for
each rat and were used to assign the rats to experimental
conditions. the design of this experiment was a completely
between-group factorial consisting of pretreatment and treatment combinations yielding 24 groups. the pretreatment factor consisted of vehicle, 0.1 mg/kg rs, 0.5 mg/kg rs, 2.5 mg/
kg rs, 10 mg/kg rs, or the positive control of 2 mg/kg  xxxd3000xxx . the treatment factor was vehicle, 5 mg/kg ppa, 10 mg/
kg ppa, or 15 mg/kg ppa. the rats were randomly assigned
to one of these twenty-four pretreatment-treatment combinations. on the drug day, the rats were injected with their respec-

tive pretreatment condition at 215 min and their treatment
condition at 210 min prior to the start of the 30 min trial.
food and water intakes were recorded to the nearest 0.1 g
and 0.1 ml for each rat as noted above.
the pretreatment and treatment intervals were chosen on
the basis of the extant literature relating the onset and duration
of action of ppa and of rs-17053. ppa and rs-17053 exhibit
similar profiles with a rapid onset of action (less than 5 min)
following systemic administration, with a duration of action
exceeding 60 min (d. e. clarke, personal communication,
may 15, 1996; 16,19).
data analyses
the food intake and water intake data of this experiment
were analyzed using two separate designs. the primary design
was a 534 factorial with a between-group factor of drug
pretreatment (vehicle, 0.1 rs, 0.5 rs, 2.5 rs, or 10 mg/
kg rs) and a between-group factor of ppa dose (vehicle, 5,
10, or 15 mg/kg ppa). the secondary design was a 234 factorial with a between-group factor of drug pretreat-

rs 17053 and phenylpropanolamine anorexia

283

ment (vehicle, 2.0 mg/kg  xxxd3000xxx ) and a between-group
factor of ppa dose (vehicle, 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg ppa). separate general linear model (glm) analyses (2) were computed using sas for the dependent variables of food intake
and water intake. additional contrasts were made using duncan’s multiple range procedure. difference probabilities less
than 0.05 were deemed statistically significant.
results

figure 1 depicts the changes in food intake associated with
the rs-17053 and  xxxd3000xxx  pretreatments and the ppa treatments of this experiment. a glm analysis revealed a significant effect of the ppa treatment condition [ f (3, 132) 5 29.74,
p 5 0.0019]. post-hoc analyses using duncan’s procedure
(a 5 0.05, df 5 132, mse 5 0.588) revealed that the vehicle
treatment condition was significantly different from the 10
mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ppa treatment conditions and that the
vehicle and 5 mg/kg ppa treatment conditions were significantly different from the 15 mg/kg ppa treatment condition.
the glm analysis revealed that rs-17053 pretreatment significantly altered food intake [ f (4, 132) 5 6.28, p , 0.0001].
further contrasts using duncan’s procedure (a 5 0.05, df 5
132, mse 5 0.557), revealed that 10 mg/kg rs-17053 significantly suppressed food intake. however, informal observation
of the rats after injection suggested that the locomotion was
impaired at the 10 mg/kg rs-17053 dose. in contrast, no significant differences were noted between vehicle and the 0.12.5 mg/kg doses of rs-17053. thus, the sole effect of rs17053 on feeding in this experiment was an inhibitory one, but
was only evident at a high dose that also impaired locomotion.
there was no significant interaction between rs-17053 pretreatment conditions and ppa treatment conditions [ f (12,
132) 5 1.58, p , 0.1049]. thus, pretreatment with rs-17053,
at doses that alone did not alter feeding, had no impact on
anorexia induced by ppa.
 xxxd3000xxx  pretreatment at 2 mg/kg reversed the anorexic
action of systemic ppa. a glm analysis revealed a significant
effect of  xxxd3000xxx  pretreatment [ f (1, 63) 5 7.34, p 5 0.0090],
but no significant interaction of  xxxd3000xxx  pretreatment conditions with ppa treatment conditions [ f (3, 63) 5 0.78, p 5
0.5096].
figure 2 depicts the changes in water intake associated
with the rs-17053 and  xxxd3000xxx  pretreatment conditions and
the ppa treatment conditions of this experiment. a glm
analysis revealed a significant effect of the ppa treatment
condition [ f (3, 132) 5 15.1, p , 0.0001] on water intake.
post-hoc analyses using duncan’s procedure (a 5 0.05, df 5
132, mse 5 1.0377) revealed that water intakes after each of
the three ppa treatment doses were significantly reduced
relative to water intake after vehicle treatment, but these
doses were not different from one another. the rs-17053
pretreatment conditions did not significantly alter water intake
[ f (4, 132) 5 0 .54, p 5 0.7055], nor was there evident a
significant interaction between rs-17053 pretreatment and
ppa treatment conditions [ f (12, 132) 5 0.49, p 5 0.9136].
finally, there was no effect of  xxxd3000xxx  pretreatment on water
intake [ f(1,54) 5 0.11, p 5 0.7372] nor was there a significant
interaction between  xxxd3000xxx  pretreatment conditions and
ppa treatment conditions [ f (3, 54) 5 1.55, p 5 0.2113].
discussion

the a1-adrenoceptor hypothesis suggests that ppa suppresses feeding via activation of a1-adrenoceptors (18). the
current study examined whether ppa anorexia results from

fig. 2. mean group water intake (ml) during a 30 min period for
rats pretreated (215 min) with either vehicle, various doses of rs17053 (rs: 0.1–10.0 mg/kg) or 2 mg/kg  xxxd3000xxx  ( xxxd1655xxx ) and then
treated (210 min) with either 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg ppa. the lines
above each bar represent the standard error of the mean. different
letters above the bars indicate a significant difference (bars with a
common letter are not significantly different); p , 0.05.

the selective activation by ppa of a specific subtype of
a1-adrenoceptors. the ligand chosen in the current study was
rs-17053, a recently identified compound known to selectively
inactivate a1a-adrenoceptors (6,7). rs-17053 has a rapid onset
of action, and a duration of action exceeding 60 min (d. e.
clark, personal communication, may 15, 1996). except at a
very high dosage of 10 mg/kg, rs-17053 did not alter food
intake or water intake, nor did this antagonist reverse the
anorexia induced by ppa doses ranging from 5-15 mg/kg. this
finding suggests that ppa does not act via the a1a subtype to
suppress feeding.
 xxxd3000xxx  has been noted to bind with equal affinity to each
of the three a1a subtypes (5,7), and is thus a non-selective
antagonist for a1-adrenoceptors. in the present study, a single
dose of  xxxd3000xxx  (2 mg/kg) was noted to reliably antagonize
the anorexia induced by ppa doses ranging from 5–15 mg/
kg. the present results are similar to those obtained in our
earlier study in which systemic  xxxd3000xxx  reversed the anorexic
action of ppa (17). the effect of  xxxd3000xxx  was restricted to
the anorexic activity of ppa. water intake was suppressed by
ppa, but this effect was not a function of dose, as was the
case for the effect of ppa on food intake. antagonism of

284

wellman et al.

a1-adrenoceptors using  xxxd3000xxx  did not alter the action of
ppa on water intake. this outcome also confirms our earlier
study in which systemic  xxxd3000xxx  did not alter the hypodipsic
activity of ppa.
the present findings suggest that although ppa anorexia
is reversed by systemic administration of  xxxd3000xxx , ppa is
unlikely to suppress feeding via the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype.
whether the a1b- or a1d-adrenoceptor subtypes may play a
role in ppa anorexia is an open question due to the lack of
suitable selective receptor subtype antagonists (9). yet, there
are hints in the literature that may point to the a1d-adrenoceptor subtype as playing a role in mediating ppa anorexia.
oshita, kigoshi, and muramatsu (15) noted that the a1-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2601xxx  exerted significant activity at
a1d-adrenoceptors in rabbit aorta, but was without effect at
a1b-adrenoceptors in rabbit aorta.  xxxd2601xxx  may thus
represent a pharmacological probe by which to dissociate a1dadrenoceptors and a1b-adrenoceptors. interestingly, an-

orexia is noted in rats following microinjections of  xxxd2601xxx  into the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pvn: 4),
a brain region containing a1-adrenoceptors (20). although
no study to date has compared the relative distribution of a1dand a1b-adrenoceptors within the pvn, each receptor subtype
has been localized within rat brain (5). these preliminary
studies hint that ppa may act via the a1d-adrenoceptor subclass, but a firm conclusion awaits future studies that examine
the effects on feeding in rats of administration of selective
a1d-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists.
