abstract - the activities of some antioxidative and hexose monophosphate shunt
enzymes, as well as of 2 hydrolases were studied in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens
taken from 39 patients with neuromuscular diseases and from 15 controls. the
activity of se-dependent glutathione peroxidase was higher in patients with congenital myotonia, whereas in the other diagnostic groups this enzyme activity was the
same as in the controls. the se-independent and total glutathione peroxidase activity
of patients in the various diagnostic groups did not differ from the controls.
moreover, no difference were observed in catalase activity between the patient
groups and the controls. the activities of the rate limiting enzymes of hexose
monophosphate shunt,  xxxg825xxx  and  xxxd593xxx 
dehydrogenase of muscle biopsy samples of various patient groups did not show any
significant difference from controls. the activity of a lysosomal hydrolase, b-nacetylglucosaminidase, was increased in patients with polyneuropathy and the
activity of a nonlysosomal protease, alkaline protease, was high in patients with
charcot-marie-tooth disease. the activities of se-dependent glutathione peroxidase,
6- xxxg1733xxx  and of both hydrolases showed a significant
correlation to the magnitude of muscle atrophy.

muscle wasting and connective tissue accumulation are the characteristic findings encountered in
most neuromuscular diseases. although the primary mechanisms underlying these phenomena
are still unknown, a lot of biochemical evidence
suggest that these processes are linked with the
activation of both the lysosomal and non-lysosoma1 hydrolytic pathways of muscle degradation
(1 -3) and with simultaneous acceleration of collagen biosynthesis (4-6). during the last few
years, special attention has been paid to the
possible role of the insufficient antioxidation of

2

muscle tissue in the development of membrane
damage found in neuromuscular diseases, attention which has even resulted in therapeutic enterprises. lipid peroxidation and other free radical
reactions are generally associated with damage of
cellular structures and function (7-9), and these
autocatalytic reactions might constitute the primary mechanism inducing the membrane damage
linked with the manifestation of neuromuscular
disease. this membrane hypothesis has even been
widened to embrance the ageing process, suggesting that the primary event in ageing might be free

radical induced damage to the biological membrane lipid and protein components. (10, 11).
furthermore, it has been pointed out that the
products of lipid peroxidation might initiate the
activation of acid hydrolytic enzymes. lipid peroxides are formed when oxygen radicals in a
soluiion react with polyunsaturated lipids (9).
unsaturated membrane lipids are especially suspectible to such peroxide damage.
it has been shown that lipid peroxidation is
involved in nutritionally induced animal myopathies which can be prevented by antioxidants or
selenium (12, 13). an increased level of lipid
peroxidation has also been verified by kar and
pearson (8) and mechler et al. (14) in human
dystrophic muscle. selenium is a part of the
enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which catalyses
the oxidation of glutathione with simultaneous
detoxification of lipid peroxides. decreased concentration of selenium in blood has been described in patients with myotonic dystrophy (15).
hexose monophosphate shunt is important for
antioxidation because it reduces nadp to
nadph, which is necessary, e.g. for the reduction of  xxxd2811xxx . there are some
reports of the increased activity of hexose monophosphate shunt in experimental (16) and human
myopathies (17, 18).
the purpose of the present study was to determine the activities of selected antioxidative, hexose monophosphate shunt and hydrolytic enzymes in the muscle tissue of patients with
adulttype myogenic and neurogenic muscle diseases and to compare the activities with the
severity of muscular atrophy.

mean age being 41 years. they comprised the
following diagnostic groups: 5 patients with
congenital myotonia (mean age 29 years; range,
24-41 years; mean duration of the symptoms,
16 years); 7 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(mean age 50 years; range 38-69 years; mean
duration of the disease 10 months), 15 with
polyneuropathy, 5 of whom with charcot-marie-tooth disease (mean age 47 years; range
29-68 years; mean duration of the disease 6
years), 4 with non-defined myopathy (mean age
39 years; range 19-52 years; mean duration of
the disease 7 years), 4 patients with various
forms of progressive muscular dystrophy (mean
age 34 years; range 17-45 years; mean duration
of the disease 20 years), and 4 duchenne muscular dystrophy carriers (mean age 33 years;
17-51 years). the controls (mean age 42 years;
range 27-56 years) had various neuromuscular
complaints, but no disease that could be
derived by laboratory tests for serum enzymes,
clinical neurophysiological examination, and
histological investigation of muscle biopsy specimens. the diagnosis of the neuromuscular disease in each patient was based on clinical
examination, laboratory tests for enzymes characteristic of neuromuscular and systemic disease (i.e. creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase
and aldolase), electroneuromyography, and histological examination of the muscle biopsy
specimen. the magnitude of muscle atrophy in
the biopsied muscle (scale of 0-3; 0 indicates no
atrophy; 1 mild atrophy; 2 moderate atrophy;
and 3 severe atrophy) was evaluated by a clinical
neurophysiologist. in all the cases muscle atrophies were verified in more than on limb.

patients and methods
patients
muscle-biopsy specimens and serum samples
were obtained from patients for diagnostic purpose. in accord with the principles of the declaration helsinki, all muscle samples were
obtained with the permission of the patient.
the patient group consisted of 39 subjects with
various neuromuscular diseases and of is controls. there were 33 males and 21 females, the

biopsy specimens
the muscle biopsy specimens were taken from an
affected muscle, i.e. either the anterior tibia1
muscle (50), quadriceps femoris (2), or deltoid
muscle (2), with a weil-blakeslay conchotome
under local 1070 lidocaine-epinephrine anaesthesia. the specimens were washed with cold
0.9%  xxxd3213xxx , dried with gauze,
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -7ooc until
assayed.

assay
the frozen muscle biopsy specimens were homogenized in ice-cold 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at a p h of 7.4, with an allglass
homogenizer (potter-elvehjelm) (670 rpm). homogenates were made in distilled water to a
concentration of 5% (w/v). due to the small
size of biopsy specimens not all the enzyme
assays could be carried out on all the patients.
the following enzyme activities were assayed on
the homogenates: se-dependent ( xxxg948xxx .9)
( i 9) and se-independent glutathione peroxidase
(20), catalase ( xxxg345xxx ) (21), glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg72xxx   xxxg73xxx   xxxg74xxx   xxxg75xxx   xxxg76xxx   xxxg77xxx   xxxg110xxx   xxxg111xxx   xxxg112xxx   xxxg113xxx   xxxg114xxx   xxxg115xxx   xxxg116xxx   xxxg257xxx   xxxg540xxx   xxxg615xxx   xxxg634xxx   xxxg635xxx   xxxg637xxx   xxxg935xxx   xxxg1013xxx   xxxg1046xxx   xxxg1060xxx   xxxg1072xxx   xxxg1084xxx   xxxg1085xxx   xxxg1088xxx   xxxg1092xxx   xxxg1095xxx   xxxg1132xxx   xxxg1133xxx   xxxg1134xxx   xxxg1313xxx   xxxg1314xxx   xxxg1315xxx   xxxg1316xxx   xxxg1317xxx   xxxg1390xxx   xxxg1393xxx   xxxg1394xxx   xxxg1395xxx   xxxg1739xxx   xxxg1943xxx   xxxg1946xxx   xxxg2186xxx   xxxg2430xxx .49) (22),

the

discussion
clinically, various neuromuscular diseases greatly resemble each other, the gradual muscle loss
being the most characteristic clinical feature.
electrophysiologically, the differentiation into
myopathies and neurogenic lesions is usually easy
to carry out. however, a more detailed and biochemical approach is needed in order to penetrate into pathophysiology of the diseases, in the
majority of which a disturbance of the functions
of the sarcolemma and mitochondria seems to be
evident (26-28). therefore, it seems justifiable to
invistigate the rate of lipid peroxidation and

shunt enzymes in nm disease

especially the activities of enzymes of muscle
tissue showing protective functions in free radical
reactions.
there are some reports indicating lipid peroxidation of muscle tissue to be increased in some
nutritionally (14) or exercise induced (29) animal
myopathies. however, endurance training seems
to reduce the susceptibility of mouse skeletal
muscle to lipid peroxidation but not to result in
any change in some antioxidants (30).
recent results on patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy indicate a significant increase of
lipid peroxidation in muscle samples (8, 14) but
not in erythrocytes (14). in the present study
alterations in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, proved to be of a minor nature. in myotonic
patients, who typically show an increased irritability of muscle cell membranes, increased
activity of se-dependent glutathione peroxidase
was verified. clinically these patients have an
athletic appearance: the strong muscle fibre
activity produces a musculature similar to that
induced by physical training. in the other
groups, even in patients with muscular dystrophies often treated with selenium the activities of
the glutathione peroxidases and that of catalase
remained within the range of controls, which
observation does not refer to an insufficient antioxidative capacity.
it has been reported that catalase activity
increases during starvation-induced muscle wasting in rats and it has been suggested that this
increase is a valid indicator of the activity of
muscle disease processes (31). in the present
human material, however, no correlation could
be observed between catalase activity and the
degree of muscle atrophy. increased activities of
 xxxg825xxx  and 6- xxxg1733xxx  have been reported
in experimental myopathies (16, 32) and in some
human neuromuscular diseases (18). in our material high individual activities of both enzymes
were not statistically significant, a fact which is
possibly explained by the heterogenous nature of
the material where the duration of the disease of
the various individuals varied markedly. however, when surveying the whole material the
enzyme activities showed a positive correlation to

23

the magnitude of muscle atrophy and to the
activities of hydrolases. the clear correlations
between both the hydrolases studied (lysosomal
and nonlysosomal) and the muscle atrophy is in
accordance with our earlier results (3). the detection of increased values in patients with disorders
of both neurogenic and myogenic origin suggests
a non-specific character of this increase of
hydrolytic capacity.
as a conclusion drawn from the present results
we would suggest that there seems to be general
activation of hexose-monophosphate shunt and
the hydrolytic enzyme system in the wasting
processes of human muscle tissue of various origin, but that there is no support for the role of a
defective antioxidative capacity of muscle tissue
in the pathogenesis of the neuromuscular diseases studied.
