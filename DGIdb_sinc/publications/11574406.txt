structural basis for the interference between
nicorandil and sulfonylurea action
frank reimann,1,2 frances m. ashcroft,2 and fiona m. gribble1

nicorandil is a new antianginal agent that potentially
may be used to treat the cardiovascular side effects of
diabetes. it is both a  xxxd2738xxx  donor and an opener of
atp-sensitive kⴙ (katp) channels in muscle and thereby causes vasodilation of the coronary vasculature. the
aim of this study was to investigate the domains of the
 xxxg1253xxx  involved in nicorandil activity and to determine whether nicorandil interacts with hypoglycemic
sulfonylureas that target katp channels in pancreatic
␤-cells. katp channels in muscle and ␤-cells share a common pore-forming subunit,  xxxg1250xxx , but possess alternative sulfonylurea receptors (surs;  xxxg19xxx  in ␤-cells,
sur2a in cardiac muscle, and sur2b in smooth muscle).
we expressed recombinant katp channels in xenopus
oocytes and measured the effects of drugs and nucleotides by recording macroscopic currents in excised membrane patches. nicorandil activated  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b but not  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents, consistent
with its specificity for cardiac and smooth muscle katp
channels. drug activity depended on the presence of
intracellular nucleotides and was impaired when the
walker a lysine residues were mutated in either nucleotide-binding domain of  xxxg20xxx . chimeric studies showed
that the cooh-terminal group of transmembrane helices
(tms), especially tm 17, is responsible for the specificity of nicorandil for channels containing  xxxg20xxx . the
splice variation between sur2a and sur2b altered the
off-rate of the nicorandil response. finally, we showed
that nicorandil activity was unaffected by  xxxd2202xxx ,
which specifically blocks  xxxg19xxx -type katp channels, but
was severely impaired by  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx ,
which target both  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx -type katp channels.

icorandil is currently undergoing clinical trials
and is being increasingly used for the treatment
of angina (1). it has a  xxxd2082xxx , operating
both as a  xxxd2738xxx ⫺generating agent and as
an opener of atp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels in vascular
smooth and cardiac muscle (2). the katp channels in
these tissues are closely related to those that regulate
insulin secretion from pancreatic ␤-cells (3). like the
␤-cell channel, they are blocked by many of the sulfonylureas that are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes (4).
because type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, many diabetic patients might benefit from
therapy with both sulfonylureas and nicorandil. the current study was undertaken to investigate the molecular
basis for the previously reported tissue specificity of
nicorandil and to determine whether significant interactions might occur between nicorandil and sulfonylureas
when both drugs are administered concurrently.
katp channels respond to alterations in the metabolic
activity of the cell and thereby act as sensors of glucose
and oxygen availability. in pancreatic ␤-cells, katp channels are open at low glucose concentrations; their closure
in response to an increase in glucose metabolism leads to
membrane depolarization, thereby triggering the entry of
calcium and release of insulin (5). the opening of katp
channels in vascular smooth muscle results in muscle
relaxation and vasodilation (6). in cardiac muscle, the
katp channels are believed to be closed under normal
physiological conditions; their opening during hypoxia
results in a protective shortening of the cardiac action
potential that reduces cardiac work (7). in all these
tissues, the katp channels are believed to respond to
changes in the concentrations of adenine nucleotides.
the molecular composition of katp channels differs
among tissue types and provides a basis for targeting
drugs to a specific organ. the pore of the channel is
formed from four inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx 
subunits ( xxxg1250xxx , but kir6.1 in some smooth muscle channels) (8 –10), and atp inhibits katp channels by direct
interaction with  xxxg1250xxx  (11). an additional regulatory subunit, the sur, endows the channels with sensitivity to mg
nucleotides (which enhance channel activity) and therapeutic drugs such as the sulfonylureas and  xxxg1253xxx 
openers (3,12). the sur, a member of the atp-binding
cassette (abc) transporter family, is a large membrane
protein containing 17 transmembrane helices (tms), arranged in three groups of five, six, and six (13). it also
possesses two intracellular nucleotide-binding domains
(nbds). each  xxxg1253xxx  contains four kir and four
2253

nicorandil action on katp channels

sur subunits (3). two genes encoding surs have been
identified.  xxxg19xxx  is predominantly expressed in pancreatic
␤-cells and some neurones (14,15). alternative splicing of
 xxxg20xxx  produces sur2a (in cardiac muscle) and sur2b (in
smooth muscle) (16,17).  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  share 71% identity; sur2a and sur2b differ only in their cooh-terminal
42 amino acids.
in recent years, a number of sites on surs critical for
the binding and regulatory activity of nucleotides, sulfonylureas, and  xxxg1253xxx  openers have been identified.
the effect of nucleotides is dependent on their interaction
with walker a and walker b motifs in the nbds (18,19).
by contrast, the most important domain for drug binding appears to be the cooh-terminal group of six tms.
binding sites for  xxxd2215xxx  and the  xxxg1253xxx 
opener p1075 (an analog of pinacidil) have been mapped
to this area (20,21); differences between  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx 
within this region account for the tissue-specific effects of
sulfonylureas and some  xxxg1253xxx  openers. for example, a single residue (s1237 of  xxxg19xxx ) that is essential for
the selective inhibition of  xxxg19xxx -containing channels by
 xxxd3394xxx  has been identified in the cytoplasmic loop
connecting tms 15 and 16 (20). two additional amino
acids in tm 17 (t1253 and l1249 of  xxxg20xxx ) have been
implicated in the  xxxg20xxx -selective action of cromakalim
analogs (22). however, homologous residues of  xxxg19xxx  and
 xxxg20xxx  are also involved in drug binding, as  xxxd1868xxx  and
the nonsulfonylurea moiety of  xxxd2215xxx  exhibit similar potencies on katp channels containing the different
sur subtypes (4,23). domains important for the action of
nicorandil have not yet been identified.
in this study, we investigated the effects of nicorandil on
recombinant katp channels by expressing the different
channel subtypes in xenopus oocytes. currents were
recorded in inside-out membrane patches in response to
the addition of nucleotides and drugs to the intracellular
membrane surface. our results confirmed previous studies
that have shown that nicorandil action is dependent on the
presence of intracellular nucleotides and further suggested how this might be mediated by the nbds of surs.
we used sur chimeras to show that the last tm of  xxxg20xxx 
is critical for nicorandil action, whereas the splice variation between sur2a and sur2b modifies the potency of
the drug by altering its off-rate. finally, we showed that
sulfonylureas are not homogenous in their ability to interfere with nicorandil activation: although  xxxd2215xxx  and
 xxxd2203xxx  abolished the stimulatory effect of nicorandil,
this was not the case for  xxxd2202xxx . our data therefore
suggest that for patients requiring both nicorandil and
sulfonylurea therapy, the most appropriate choice of sulfonylurea might be one that, like  xxxd2202xxx , preferentially
inhibits  xxxg19xxx -type katp channels.
research design and methods
molecular biology. mouse  xxxg1250xxx  (genbank d50581) (10), rat  xxxg19xxx  (genbank l40624) (14), rat sur2a (genbank d83598) (16), and rat sur2b
(genbank d86038) (17) cdnas were cloned into the pbf vector. chimeras
between  xxxg19xxx  and sur2a were constructed as previously described (20).
capped mrna was prepared using the mmessage mmachine large scale in
vitro transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx) as previously described (24).
oocyte collection. female xenopus laevis were anesthetized with ms222 (2
g/l added to the water). one ovary was removed via a mini-laparotomy, the
incision was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. immature stage
v–vi oocytes were incubated for 60 min with 1.0 mg/ml collagenase (type a;
2254

roche) and manually defolliculated. oocytes were injected with ⬃0.1 ng
 xxxg1250xxx  mrna and ⬃2 ng mrna encoding  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, sur2b, or the
indicated sur chimera. the final injection volume was 50 nl/oocyte. isolated
oocytes were maintained in barth’s solution and studied 1–7 days after
injection (24).
electrophysiology. patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and
had resistances of 250 –500 k⍀ when filled with pipette solution. macroscopic
currents were recorded from giant excised inside-out patches at a holding
potential of 0 mv and at 20 –24°c using an axopatch 200b patch-clamp
amplifier (axon instruments, foster city, ca) (24). the pipette (external)
solution contained (in mmol/l) 140 kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 2.6 cacl2, and 10 hepes
(ph 7.4 with koh). the bath (intracellular) solution contained (in mmol/l) 107
kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 1 cacl2, 10 egta, and 10 hepes (ph 7.2 with koh; final [k⫹]
⬃140 mmol/l). nicorandil was prepared as a 100 mmol/l stock solution in
dmso.  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx  were prepared as 1,000⫻ stock solutions in dmso.  xxxd2202xxx  was prepared as a 100 mmol/l stock in 100 mmol/l
koh. nucleotides were added with equivalent concentrations of mgcl2, and
the ph was readjusted as required. rapid exchange of solutions was achieved
by positioning the patch in the mouth of one of a series of adjacent inflow
pipes placed in the bath.
in most experiments, currents were recorded in response to repetitive 3-s
voltage ramps from ⫺110 mv to ⫹100 mv. they were filtered at 5 khz,
digitized using a digidata 1320a interface, sampled at 0.4 khz, and analyzed
using pclamp software (axon instruments). the slope conductance was
measured by fitting a straight line to the current-voltage relation between ⫺20
mv and ⫺100mv; the average response to five consecutive ramps was calculated in each solution. in time-course experiments, macroscopic currents
were recorded at a fixed potential of –50 mv, and the off-rate of nicorandil was
measured by fitting an exponential function to the decay in current after
removal of the drug.
statistical analysis. data are presented as means ⫾ 1 se. statistical
significance was tested using analysis of variance (anova) or t test (paired,
unpaired, or single sample), as indicated in the text.

results

katp channels  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  (␤-cell type),  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
(cardiac type), and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b (smooth muscle type)
were heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes. in all
cases, the currents were small in cell-attached membrane
patches because of the inhibitory effect of cytoplasmic
nucleotides but increased when the patches were excised
into nucleotide-free solution.
nucleotide dependence of nicorandil activation. figure 1 shows that nicorandil had very little effect on
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a or  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents in the absence of
added nucleotide, as previously reported for native katp
channels (25). in this respect, therefore, the action of
nicorandil contrasts with that of pinacidil and its analog
p1075, which are effective even in the absence of added
nucleotide (26,27). nicorandil (100 ␮mol/l) activated both
types of  xxxg1253xxx  in the presence of atp, and the
relative activation at different atp concentrations was
similar for both  xxxg20xxx  isoforms (table 1). however, in the
presence of high nucleotide concentrations, which themselves produced strong current inhibition, the absolute
increase in current induced by nicorandil was correspondingly smaller. the effect of nicorandil on  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
currents in the presence of 300 ␮mol/l atp plus 100 ␮mol/l
adp was not significantly different from that in 100 ␮mol/l
of atp alone. the smaller relative activation of  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2b currents in 300 ␮mol/l atp plus 100 ␮mol/l adp
may have reflected the fact that the currents reached a
maximum level of activation.
effects of walker mutations. the nucleotide requirement for the action of other k-channel openers is determined by the nbds of the sur subunit (18,19,26 –28).

(100 ␮mol/l) were added to the intracellular solution, as indicated by the bars.

other abc transporters (29 –33). when the walker a lysine
was mutated in nbd1 of sur2a or sur2b, pinacidil activation became dependent on the presence of added nucleotide (26,27). however, mutation of the equivalent residue
in nbd2 of sur2a or sur2b did not impair the amplitude
of pinacidil activation.
we therefore investigated the role of the walker a
lysines in the action of nicorandil. figure 2 shows that
mutating the walker a lysine in nbd1 (k707a) of sur2a
or sur2b abolished nicorandil activation in the presence
of 100 ␮mol/l atp. by contrast, mutating the walker a
lysine in nbd2 (k1348a) of sur2a or sur2b impaired,
but did not completely eliminate, the effect of nicorandil.
nicorandil action requires the last tm of  xxxg20xxx . the
action of nicorandil is specific for katp channels containing one of the  xxxg20xxx  isoforms, as  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents
were unaffected by 100 ␮mol/l nicorandil in solutions
containing atp alone (300 ␮mol/l) or atp plus adp (300
and 100 ␮mol/l, respectively) (fig. 3). this difference between  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  enabled us to use a chimeric approach in identifying regions of  xxxg20xxx  critical for the
activity of nicorandil. chimeric surs, in which different

domains were swapped between  xxxg19xxx  and sur2a, were
coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx  in xenopus oocytes. we tested
the effect of nicorandil in the presence of 300 ␮mol/l atp
alone or 300 ␮mol/l atp plus 100 ␮mol/l adp, and expressed the results relative to the conductance in nucleotide-free solution.
figure 3 shows that nicorandil sensitivity could be
introduced into  xxxg19xxx  by transferring tms 13–17 from
 xxxg20xxx  to  xxxg19xxx  (chimera sur1212). the last tm (tm 17)
was crucial for this effect, as nicorandil activity was
not transferred by swapping tms 13–16 alone (chimera
sur129). the reverse chimera, in which tms 13–16 were
swapped from  xxxg19xxx  to  xxxg20xxx  (chimera sur219), was also

activated by nicorandil, but to a lesser extent than wildtype sur2a. this was more clearly seen when adp was
added. these data suggest that regions within both tms
13–16 and tm 17 are essential for the full effect of nicorandil. similar regions have been reported as essential for
the binding of another  xxxg1253xxx  opener, [3h]p1075
(21), and for the activity of cromakalim analogs (22,34,35).
nicorandil is more effective on sur2b than sur2a.
previous studies have shown that the reversal rates of
pinacidil and p1075 activation are dramatically slowed by
nucleotide interaction with the nbds of sur, and that this
effect is greater for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b than  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels (27). it was postulated that the slower off-rate of
p1075 accounts for the higher affinity of the drug for
sur2b reported in binding studies, which are routinely
performed in the presence of atp. the affinity of nicorandil was also greater for sur2b than sur2a when measured by the displacement of [3h]p1075 (kd ⬃8 and ⬃19
␮mol/l, respectively) (36). because sur2a and sur2b
differ only in their final 42 amino acids, a region that does
not include the domains that have been implicated in
p1075 binding (21), we investigated whether the different
binding affinities of nicorandil might be associated with
differences in the off-rate of the drug.
figure 4a shows that in the presence of 100 ␮mol/l atp,
the off-rate of nicorandil was considerably slower for
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents (time constant, ␶ ⬃25 s) than for
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents (␶ ⬃4 s). this would be consistent
with the higher affinity of the drug for sur2b. the further
addition of 100 ␮mol/l adp did not significantly alter the
2256

nicorandil off-rates (fig. 4b). mean data are given in fig.
4c.
effects of different sulfonylureas on nicorandil activation. we have previously shown that  xxxd2215xxx 
blocks both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels with
similar potency at a high-affinity site, whereas  xxxd2202xxx 
blocks only katp channels containing the  xxxg19xxx  subunit
with high potency (23,37). because many patients require
concurrent therapy for angina and diabetes, we next investigated whether the different sulfonylureas interfere
with nicorandil activation.
figure 5 compares the effect of nicorandil in the absence
and presence of three different sulfonylureas. the sulfonylureas were tested at concentrations sufficient to
saturate the high-affinity site on the sur subunit. all the
solutions contained atp, and the conductance in the
presence of the drug was expressed relative to that in atp
alone. the stimulatory effect of 100 ␮mol/l nicorandil on
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels was not altered
by the presence of a therapeutic concentration of  xxxd2202xxx  (10 ␮mol/l) but was severely impaired by both  xxxd2215xxx  (100 nmol/l) and  xxxd2203xxx  (100 nmol/l).
discussion

in this study, we identified regions of the sulfonylurea
receptor  xxxg20xxx  that are responsible for the tissue-specific
effects of nicorandil, and showed that the greater potency

compared with  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a (cardiac muscle type) chandiabetes, vol. 50, october 2001

the form i ⴝ io exp – (t/␶) ⴙ c (where i is the current at time t, io is the
current at t ⴝ 0, and ␶ is the time constant). the number of patches is
given above the bars. no significant difference (ns) was observed when
the time constants in the absence and presence of adp for a given
channel type were compared using an unpaired t test.

nels may, at least in part, be attributable to a slower
reversal of channel activation when the drug is removed.
also important is that we demonstrated that the ability
of nicorandil to open  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b
channels is unaffected by concurrent application of  xxxd2202xxx  but is severely impaired by both  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd2203xxx .
nucleotide requirement for nicorandil action. the
effects of several sulfonylureas and  xxxg1253xxx  openers
are modified by the interaction of mg nucleotides with the
nbds of surs (18,19,26 –28,38). nicorandil is no exception, and its stimulatory effect on  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2b channels requires the presence of atp at the
intracellular membrane surface. previous studies on native katp channels in cardiac muscle have suggested that
nicorandil action is also dependent on the presence of
mgadp (25). our data show that although adp enhances
the absolute current increase induced by the drug, atp is
sufficient to support nicorandil action.
the effects of the walker a mutations suggest an
diabetes, vol. 50, october 2001

underlying mechanism to explain the nucleotide dependency of nicorandil action. previous studies have concluded that atp remains bound at nbd1 for several
minutes after patch excision and that this is prevented by
mutation of the walker a lysine (26,39). in the current
study, mutating the walker a lysine in nbd1 abolished
nicorandil activation, even in the presence of added atp,
suggesting that nucleotide binding at this nbd is crucial
for activity of the drug. because nicorandil was ineffective
in the absence of added nucleotide, even when applied
immediately after patch excision, it appears that atp
binding at nbd1 is not sufficient to support nicorandil
activation.
mutation of the walker a lysine in nbd2 impaired but
did not completely abolish nicorandil activation. other
studies have shown that nbd2 of  xxxg20xxx  is able to hydrolyze atp and that mutating the walker a lysine to alanine
reduced, but did not completely prevent, nucleotide hydrolysis at nbd2 (33,40). our results therefore suggest
that binding and/or hydrolysis of nucleotide at nbd2, in
addition to that at nbd1, is required for nicorandil action.
the nucleotide requirements of nicorandil differ from
those of pinacidil, which appears to be effective even when
nucleotide is bound only at nbd1 (26). in this respect,
nicorandil action more closely resembles that of  xxxd1868xxx , which, in the case of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents, is also
enhanced in the presence of added adp (41).
measuring the nicorandil off-rate. the splice variation
between sur2a and sur2b alters only the cooh-terminal 42 amino acids and results in channels that exhibit
different responses to nucleotides (17,27,42). the principal
effect of the splice variation on the action of nicorandil
was to modify the drug off-rate. previous studies have
shown that pinacidil activation of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents
reverses more slowly than that of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents,
and that this rate is dependent on nucleotide interactions
with both nbds (26,27). the different nicorandil off-rates
measured for channels containing sur2a and sur2b may
therefore be explained by an interaction between nucleotide binding at the nbds and a drug-binding site in the
cooh-terminal group of tms of  xxxg20xxx . the slower nicorandil off-rate recorded for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b compared with
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents is reflected in the greater affinity of
sur2b for nicorandil measured in binding studies (36).
the affinities of sur2a and sur2b for nicorandil,
measured in binding studies by the displacement of
[3h]p1075, were 19 and 8 ␮mol/l, respectively (36). similar
values have been reported for native cardiac and smooth
muscle tissues (36). although the potency of nicorandil on
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels expressed in hek293 cells was
also in this range (ec50, 10 ␮mol/l), this was not the case
for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels (ec50 ⬎500 ␮mol/l) (43). our
results are more compatible with those obtained in binding studies, as we did not observe any further increase in
the response of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents to nicorandil when
the drug concentration was increased from 100 ␮mol/l to 1
mmol/l (data not shown). we also found that the splice
variation between sur2a and sur2b altered the nicorandil off-rate approximately fivefold, consistent with the
moderate difference in the affinity between sur2a and
sur2b found in binding studies. a possible explanation
for the greater ec50 of nicorandil measured for  xxxg1250xxx /

nicorandil action on katp channels

fig. 5. interference of sulfonylurea and nicorandil action. macroscopic: currents were recorded from oocytes coexpressing  xxxg1250xxx  and either
sur2a or sur2b. nicorandil (100 ␮mol/l) was applied in the presence of atp (100 ␮mol/l, but 300 ␮mol/l in the case of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents
with  xxxd2203xxx ). after activation reached steady state,  xxxd2202xxx  (10 ␮mol/l),  xxxd2215xxx  (100 nmol/l), or  xxxd2203xxx  (100 nmol/l) was also
added. the mean conductance in the presence of nicorandil or nicorandil plus sulfonylurea (g) is expressed relative to the mean conductance
measured in the presence of atp alone (gatp). the conductance in the presence of atp (and atp plus nicorandil) is given as the average of
conductances measured before and after application of the sulfonylurea. the number of patches is given above each bar. *p < 0.01; **p < 0.001;
ns, nonsignificant (using a paired t test to compare the conductance in atp plus nicorandil and atp plus nicorandil plus sulfonylurea).

sur2a currents in hek293 cells is the presence of the
high (3 mmol/l) intracellular atp concentration used in
these experiments (43), as our data showed that nicorandil
activation is modulated by the nucleotide concentration.
the intracellular solution in whole cell experiments may
also contain other factors that modulate channel activity.
identification of domains critical for nicorandil activity. the specificity of nicorandil for katp channels
containing  xxxg20xxx  isoforms enabled us to use a chimeric
approach to identifying regions of surs important for
activity of the drug. we showed that the final tm (tm 17)
of  xxxg20xxx  is essential for nicorandil activity but that the
preceding four tms are also required to confer a full drug
response. the chimeric approach has been previously
used to show that the cooh-terminal group of tms is also
involved in the binding of radiolabeled  xxxd2215xxx  to
 xxxg19xxx  and of p1075 to  xxxg20xxx  (20,21). the final tm helix was
shown to be crucial for both [3h]p1075 binding and
cromakalim activity (21,22,35), although it was not required for pinacidil activity (12).
interaction between nicorandil and sulfonylureas.
our results clearly showed that nicorandil action on
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels is severely impaired by  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx  but is unaffected
by  xxxd2202xxx . the lack of interference by  xxxd2202xxx  is not
surprising, as this drug blocks ␤-cell but not cardiac or
smooth muscle types of  xxxg1253xxx  (37). in contrast,
 xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx  block all three types of
katp channels with high affinity (23,44). although  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx  can reverse the stimulatory effect
of nicorandil, we cannot distinguish whether this is because the drugs impair nicorandil binding or interfere with
the transduction of nicorandil binding into channel opening. the former idea, however, is supported by the fact
2258

that  xxxd2215xxx  displaces the binding of [3h]p1075 from
 xxxg20xxx  (36).
conclusion. the differential potency of nicorandil between tissues can be explained by sequence variations in
tms 13–17 and the last 42 amino acids of the sur. the
effect of nicorandil is impaired by concomitant administration of  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd2203xxx , but is not affected
by  xxxd2202xxx . the results thus clearly indicate that care
should be taken in clinical practice when prescribing
combinations of  xxxg1253xxx  openers and sulfonylureas,
because drugs like  xxxd2215xxx  may impair the clinical
effectiveness of nicorandil.
