 abstract 
 
 gaba a  receptors that contain either the  xxxg833xxx ‐ or  xxxg835xxx ‐subunit isoform do not recognize classical 1,4‐benzodiazepines (bzds). however, other classes of  xxxd1459xxx  site ligands, including beta‐carbolines, bind to these diazepam‐insensitive receptor subtypes. some beta‐carbolines [e.g. ethyl beta‐carboline‐3‐carboxylate (beta‐cce) and methyl 6,7‐dimethoxy‐4‐ethyl‐beta‐carboline‐3‐carboxylate (dmcm)] display a higher affinity for  xxxg833xxx ‐ compared to  xxxg835xxx ‐containing receptors. in order to identify the structural determinants that underlie these affinity differences, we constructed chimeric  xxxg835xxx / xxxg833xxx  subunits and co‐expressed these with wild‐type rat  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  and  xxxg842xxx  l  subunits in tsa201 cells for radioligand binding analysis. after identification of candidate regions, site‐directed mutagenesis was used to narrow the ligand selectivity to a single amino acid residue (alpha6n204/alpha4i203). substitutions at alpha6n204 did not alter the affinity of the imidazobenzodiazepine ro15‐4513. a homologous mutation in the diazepam‐sensitive  xxxg830xxx  subunit (s205n) resulted in a 7–8‐fold reduction in affinity for the beta‐carbolines examined. although the binding of the classical agonist flunitrazepam was relatively unaffected by this mutation in the  xxxg830xxx  subunit, the affinity for ro15‐1788 and ro15‐4513 was decreased by ∼19‐fold and ∼38‐fold respectively. the importance of this residue, located in the loop c region of the extracellular n‐terminus of the subunit protein, emphasizes the differential interaction of ligands with the  xxxg216xxx  in diazepam‐sensitive and ‐insensitive receptors.

 gamma‐ xxxd2177xxx  type a (gaba a ) receptors are the major inhibitory receptors in the mammalian cns. these receptors are members of the ligand‐gated ion channel (lgic) family that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine and serotonin type 3 (5‐ht 3 ) receptors ( ortells and lunt 1995 ). each gaba a  receptor is a heteropentamer of homologous subunits that assemble to form a gaba‐gated, chloride‐selective ion pore. several different classes of receptor subunits have been cloned ( xxxg830xxx –6,  xxxg836xxx –3,  xxxg841xxx –3, delta, ɛ, pi and theta) (for reviews, see  barnard  et al . 1998 ;  korpi  et al . 2002 ) and different combinations of these subunits in the oligomer determine the pharmacology of the receptor subtype. although the number of subtypes remains unknown, most receptors appear to be formed by alpha, beta and gamma subunits in a 2 : 2 : 1 stoichiometry ( tretter  et al . 1997 ;  farrar  et al . 1999 ). allosteric modulation is a hallmark feature of the gaba a  receptor and this is best exemplified by compounds that act at the benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ) binding site. ligands of many chemical classes recognize this site and these compounds display a spectrum of efficacy from positive to negative allosteric modulation of gaba‐gated chloride currents ( barnard  et al . 1998 ).
          
 all receptors in the lgic family share common structural features, including a similar subunit topology and overall receptor conformation. in all members of the family, agonist binding sites are thought to lie at subunit–subunit interfaces and to be formed by six distinct stretches or ‘loops’ of amino acids; three of these domains (a–c) are contributed by one subunit, and the other three (d–f) are provided by the adjacent subunit in the pentamer (reviewed in  corringer  et al . 2000 ). in the case of the gaba a  receptor, gaba binding sites are predicted to lie at the interfaces between the beta–alpha (see  smith and olsen 1995 ) and alpha–beta ( newell  et al . 2000 ) subunits. the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site is predicted to be formed by homologous loops of amino acids that lie at the interface between alpha and gamma subunits ( sigel and buhr 1997 ;  cromer  et al . 2002 ;  ernst  et al . 2003 ).  xxxd1459xxx  pharmacology is determined by the specific alpha‐ and gamma‐subunit isoforms that are present in the receptor oligomer. the incorporation of the  xxxg833xxx  or  xxxg835xxx  subunit in the receptor, for example, bestows insensitivity to diazepam and other classical 1,4‐bzds, a property that has been ascribed to the substitution of a histidine (h101, rat  xxxg830xxx ‐subunit numbering) by an arginine ( wieland  et al . 1992 ). however, other ligands from diverse classes retain affinity for these diazepam‐insensitive (di) receptors and some display differential affinity for those containing the  xxxg833xxx  or  xxxg835xxx  isoform. certain beta‐carboline and pyrazoloquinolinone ligands, for example, have higher affinity for di receptors in the cortex compared with the cerebellum ( ito  et al . 1994 ). studies with recombinant receptors suggest that this may be due to the higher levels of expression of the  xxxg833xxx  subunit in the cortex compared with the cerebellum, where the  xxxg835xxx  subunit is preferentially expressed (see  yang  et al . 1995 ;  gunnersen  et al . 1996 ;  knoflach  et al . 1996 ).
          
 this study initially focused on the identification of specific residues in the  xxxg833xxx  and  xxxg835xxx  subunits that confer the differential affinity for certain beta‐carbolines. in order to identify regions of interest, we used a chimeric approach similar to that used previously in the analysis of binding requirements of  xxxd1459xxx  ligands (e.g.  boileau  et al . 1998 ). randomly derived chimeras from the  xxxg833xxx  and  xxxg835xxx  subunits were created and, based on their observed binding characteristics, individual residues were targeted for site‐directed mutagenesis. this led to the identification of a specific residue (alpha6n204/alpha4i203) that bestows the differential affinity for beta‐carbolines. by mutating the homologous residue in the  xxxg830xxx  subunit to that found in  xxxg835xxx  (s205n), we showed that, although this residue has little influence on binding of the classical agonist flunitrazepam, it has significant effects on the binding of both beta‐carbolines and the imidazobenzodiazepines ( i ‐ xxxd1459xxx ) ro15‐1788 and ro15‐4513.

 ro15‐4513 and ro15‐1788 were gifts from hoffmann‐la roche and co. (basel, switzerland). ethyl beta‐carboline‐3‐carboxylate (beta‐cce) was a generous gift from dr brian jones (glaxosmithkline, harlow, uk). methyl 6,7‐dimethoxy‐4‐ethyl‐beta‐carboline‐3‐carboxylate (dmcm) was obtained from rbi/sigma (natick, ma, usa). [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 (23.06 ci/mmol) and [ 3 h]flunitrazepam (84.5 ci/mmol) were obtained from perkin‐elmer (boston, ma, usa).
          
 
 
  production of alpha‐subunit chimeras 
 several randomly derived alpha‐subunit chimeras (chi) were created following the protocol of  moore and blakely (1994 ). sequences of both the rat  xxxg835xxx ‐ and  xxxg833xxx ‐subunit cdna were subcloned into the same pcdna3.1(+) expression vector (invitrogen, san diego, ca, usa) ( fig. 1 ). the complete  xxxg835xxx  cdna was inserted (as a  hind iii fragment) upstream of a partial  xxxg833xxx  cdna sequence (an  eco ri– xba i fragment containing an n‐terminally truncated  xxxg833xxx  sequence). a  bam hi restriction site was left in the polylinker between the inserts. restriction digestion was used to excise the intervening polylinker sequence as well as a portion of the  xxxg835xxx  insert, thereby limiting the amount of  xxxg835xxx  insert that was homologous to the  xxxg833xxx  cdna. digestion with  bam hi and  hpa i or with  eco ri and  bst xi limited the region of homology with the  xxxg833xxx  insert to a sequence in the  xxxg835xxx  cdna that represents the extracellular n‐terminus of the mature  xxxg835xxx  subunit. in this manner, random crossover events were targeted to occur in regions of the cdna that represent the extracellular, ligand binding domain of the alpha subunits, a technique that has been used previously to produce targeted random chimeras of gaba a  receptor subunits ( boileau et al. 1998 ). linearized plasmid dna was transformed into library efficiency ®  competent dh5alpha escherichia coli  cells (life technologies, gaithersburg, md, usa) where random crossover events occurred at regions of homology in the alpha‐subunit cdna sequences, producing in‐frame hybrid cdna. individual colonies were isolated and the extracted plasmid dna was assessed for size to indicate a potential recombinant crossover event. for those plasmids showing a chimeric crossover, the switch point was assessed by restriction digestion analysis and confirmed by dna sequencing. chimeras are named based on the point of crossover; the nomenclature represents the last residue of n‐terminal  xxxg835xxx ‐subunit contribution (rat subunit numbering) before the in‐frame switch. individual chimeras were used for transfection with rat  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  and  xxxg842xxx  l  plasmid constructs (see below).

  mutagenesis 
 site‐directed mutagenesis was performed using the quikchange protocol (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). wild‐type rat  xxxg835xxx  or  xxxg830xxx  cdna inserts were subcloned into pcdna3.1 (invitrogen) and were used as the templates in separate pcr‐mediated mutagenesis protocols. complementary 27‐mer mutagenic oligonucleotide primer pairs were synthesized (department of biochemistry, dna core laboratory, university of alberta, edmonton, alberta, canada) for each substitution reaction. pcr amplification with  pfu  polymerase (stratagene) was carried out under the recommended conditions. plasmid dna was digested with  dpn i endonuclease to degrade methylated template dna, and was subsequently transformed into competent  e. coli  cells for propagation of the plasmid. individual colonies were isolated and plasmid dna extracted. successful substitutions within the cdna insert of the plasmid were confirmed by dna sequencing.
          
 
 
  transient transfection 
 recombinant expression of gaba a  receptor subtypes was carried out in tsa201 cells. cells were maintained in low‐glucose dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (gibcobrl, grand island, ny, usa) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal clone iii bovine serum (hyclone, logan, ut, usa) and were provided with fresh medium before transient transfection ( davies  et al . 2000 ). briefly, subunit cdnas were subcloned into the pcdna3.1 expression vector (invitrogen). plates of cells were transiently co‐transfected with 10 µg each of wild‐type, mutant or chimeric alpha‐subunit plasmid together with wild‐type  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  and  xxxg842xxx  l  vector constructs in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. the dna was added to an appropriate volume of 250 m m   xxxg2125xxx  2 , to which was added an equal volume of  n , n ‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐2‐aminoethanesulfonic acid buffer (ph 7.02). solutions were mixed and added dropwise to plates of cells. cells were incubated at 37°c in a 3% co 2  incubator for 48 h. after incubation, cells were scraped into ice‐cold harvesting buffer (50 m m  tris, 250 m m  kcl, ph 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 m m   xxxd302xxx , 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.01 mg/ml chicken egg white  xxxd207xxx  and 0.5 m m  phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). harvested cells were homogenized with two pulses (10 s, 13 500 r.p.m.) of an ultra turrax homogenizer (ika labortechnik, staufen, germany). homogenates were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in ice‐cold harvesting buffer and stored at − 80°c until the day of experiments.
          
 
 
  radioligand binding 
 radioligand binding was performed as described previously ( davies  et al . 2000 ). in brief, for equilibrium binding assays, aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated in duplicate with increasing concentrations (0.5 n m −80 n m ) of [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 or [ 3 h]flunitrazepam in binding assay buffer (50 m m  tris, 250 m m  kcl, 0.02% nan 3 , ph 7.4) at 4°c for 60 min. non‐specific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled ro15‐4513 or flunitrazepam as appropriate. for competition binding assays, aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated with a constant concentration of radioligand (at a concentration equal to its  k d  for the receptor subtype) and increasing concentrations of displacing ligand. parallel samples were filtered through gf/b filters (whatman, maidstone, uk) using a cell harvester (brandel, gaithersburg, md, usa). the filters were immediately washed three times with 3 ml ice‐cold assay buffer before scintillation counting.
          
 
 
  data and statistical analysis 
 saturation and competition ligand binding data were analyzed using the least‐squares non‐linear regression curve‐fitting programs of graphpad prism 3.0 (graphpad, san diego, ca, usa). binding parameters ( k d  or  k i ) were determined as the mean ± sem of at least three independent experiments. data were analyzed by one‐way  anova  and levels of significance were determined by the dunnett post‐test for multiple comparisons or by a two‐tailed  t ‐test between two groups.

  binding to wild‐type alpha4beta2gamma2 and alpha6beta2gamma2 gaba a  receptors
          
 the  xxxg833xxx  and  xxxg835xxx  gaba a  receptor subunits were each recombinantly expressed with the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  and  xxxg842xxx  l  subunits in tsa201 cells for radioligand binding assays. each receptor subtype recognized [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 with nanomolar affinity ( table 1 ). this ligand was therefore used in competition studies to determine beta‐carboline affinities for these receptors. both beta‐cce and dmcm displayed a greater affinity (approximately 6‐ and 9‐fold higher respectively) for the  xxxg833xxx ‐containing subtype ( table 1 , see also  fig. 3 ).

  chimeric  xxxg835xxx / xxxg833xxx  subunits 
 chimeric alpha subunits were created from random recombination events at the cdna level. three chimeras were analyzed initially and, of these, two were identical. the two chimeric subunits with different crossover points (chi141 and chi207) were isolated for transient transfection with  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  and  xxxg842xxx  l  subunits ( fig. 1b ). expression of receptors containing the chimeric alpha subunits was verified by the retention of high‐affinity binding for [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 ( table 1 ) although, in the case of the chi207‐containing receptor, the affinity for this ligand was reduced by ∼ 4‐fold compared with the wild‐type alpha6beta2gamma2 l  receptor ( p <  0.001).
          
 competition assays were used to screen for the effect of the chimeric  xxxg216xxx  on beta‐cce affinity. the isolation of the initial two chimeras was fortunate, as inclusion of the chi141 or chi207 subunit produced receptor subtypes with an affinity for beta‐cce that was  xxxg833xxx ‐like or  xxxg835xxx ‐like respectively ( fig. 3 ;  table 1 ). thus the stretch of amino acids between the two crossover points,  xxxg835xxx (l141–e207), was implicated as containing residues that may confer the differential affinities of the  xxxg833xxx ‐ and  xxxg835xxx ‐containing receptor subtypes.
          
 
 
  effect of substitution mutations in the  xxxg835xxx  subunit 
 the  xxxg835xxx (l141–e207) region has a high degree of sequence homology with the same domain in the wild‐type  xxxg833xxx  subunit; there are only eight divergent residues. of these eight amino acids, one (alpha6n143) lies within the characteristic cys‐loop region and another (alpha6n204) lies within the loop c segment previously implicated in  xxxd1459xxx  binding ( fig. 2 ). to investigate their potential roles in beta‐carboline recognition, these residues in the  xxxg835xxx  isoform were individually substituted by their homologues in the  xxxg833xxx  subunit, i.e. alpha6n143d and alpha6n204i. expression of receptors bearing these alpha‐subunit mutations was again verified by the retention of high‐affinity binding of [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 ( table 1 ). although the alpha6n143d substitution had no significant effect on the affinity for beta‐cce, the alpha6n204i substitution resulted in a greater than 10‐fold increase in its apparent affinity ( fig. 3 ;  table 1 ), i.e. this mutation bestowed  xxxg833xxx ‐like higher affinity to the wild‐type  xxxg835xxx  subtype. this substitution also conferred higher‐affinity  xxxg833xxx ‐like binding of another beta‐carboline, dmcm ( fig. 4 ,  table 1 ). thus a single residue in loop c can account for the differences in beta‐cce and dmcm affinities for the  xxxg833xxx ‐ and  xxxg835xxx ‐receptor subtypes.

 in the other alpha subunits ( xxxg830xxx –3,5) the residue in the equivalent position to alpha6n204 is a serine ( fig. 2 ). a further substitution was therefore the alpha6n204s mutation. receptors carrying this mutation again retained high‐affinity binding of [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 ( table 1 ). the affinity of this mutant receptor for both beta‐cce and dmcm was increased approximately 5‐fold compared with their respective affinities for wild‐type  xxxg835xxx ‐containing receptors, again implicating this residue in beta‐carboline recognition.
          
 
 
  effect of substitution mutations in the  xxxg830xxx  subunit 
 in additional experiments, we characterized the binding of beta‐cce and dmcm to the wild‐type alpha1beta2gamma2 l  receptor ( table 2 ). within the  xxxg830xxx  subunit, a substitution with the  xxxg835xxx ‐subunit asparagine for the homologous serine residue (alpha1s205n) produced a mutant receptor with reduced affinity for beta‐cce and dmcm (∼6.5‐ and ∼8‐fold respectively), compared with the wild‐type  xxxg830xxx ‐containing receptors. although this alpha1s205n substitution led to a slight increase (∼3‐fold) in the affinity for [ 3 h]flunitrazepam, there were considerable decreases in the affinities for both of the  i ‐ xxxd1459xxx  compounds ro15‐1788 (∼ 19‐fold) and ro15‐4513 ( ∼38‐fold) ( fig. 5 ;  table 2 ).

  discussion 
 beyond the simple dichotomy of diazepam‐sensitive (ds) and di gaba a  receptor subtypes, ligand binding to the  xxxd1459xxx  site of the di subtypes can be pharmacologically differentiated by the inclusion of either the  xxxg833xxx  or the  xxxg835xxx  subunit. in agreement with previous reports ( yang  et al . 1995 ;  gunnersen  et al . 1996 ;  knoflach  et al . 1996 ), we found that beta‐carbolines (beta‐cce and dmcm) display higher affinity for receptors containing the  xxxg833xxx  subunit. we then used two subunit chimeras randomly derived from both the  xxxg833xxx  and  xxxg835xxx  isoforms and site‐specific mutagenesis to probe the basis of this differential affinity. substitution of a single residue within the loop c segment (alpha6n204i) was sufficient to bestow  xxxg833xxx ‐like higher affinity to the lower‐affinity  xxxg835xxx ‐containing receptor. several residues from the alpha‐subunit loop c segment have been shown previously to play a role in  xxxd1459xxx  binding (see  sigel 2002 ). the present results now implicate an additional residue in this domain of the  xxxg833xxx  and  xxxg835xxx  subunits as a determinant of beta‐carboline recognition.
          
 the results from additional mutagenesis studies show that the amino acid in the equivalent position in the  xxxg830xxx  subunit also influences beta‐carboline binding. introduction of a serine (conserved in  xxxg830xxx –3,5) into the  xxxg835xxx  isoform (alpha6n204s) resulted in an approximately 5‐fold increase in the affinity for both beta‐cce and dmcm. the reciprocal substitution at the homologous position in the  xxxg830xxx  subunit (alpha1s205n) reduced the affinity (∼ 7–8‐fold) of these ligands compared with that of wild‐type  xxxg830xxx ‐containing receptors. thus structural determinants for the binding of these ligands occur in similar domains of both di and ds receptors. these results are consistent with previous reports of altered beta‐carboline pharmacology upon mutation of other residues within the loop c domain of the  xxxg830xxx  subunit. substitutions at the neighbouring alpha1t206 (t206a,  buhr  et al . 1997 ; t206v,  schaerer  et al . 1998 ) increase dmcm affinity by 5‐ and 40‐fold respectively.
          
 the present study also demonstrates the importance of ser205 in the  xxxg830xxx  subunit in the binding of different classes of  xxxd1459xxx  site ligands. in addition to the effects on beta‐carboline affinity, the alpha1s205n substitution led to a modest increase (∼ 3‐fold) in the affinity for [ 3 h]flunitrazepam, consistent with a previous report in which the alpha1s205a mutation did not compromise the ability of classical 1,4‐bzds to potentiate gaba‐gated chloride currents ( buhr  et al . 1996 ). in contrast, the alpha1s205n substitution significantly decreased the affinity for the  i ‐bzds ro15‐1788 and ro15‐4513, by ∼ 19‐ and ∼38‐fold respectively. the large reduction in the affinity for ro15‐4513 was unexpected as homologous mutations in the  xxxg835xxx  subunit (alpha6n204i, alpha6n204s) had no appreciable effect on the binding of this ligand, permitting its use as a reporter ligand in displacement studies of beta‐carboline binding. in previous studies we have found that the binding of ro15‐4513 is much more resistant to other  xxxg830xxx ‐subunit mutations than the binding of flunitrazepam and ro15‐1788 ( davies  et al . 1998 ). additionally, several mutations within the  xxxg830xxx ‐subunit loop c domain have smaller effects on the binding of ro15‐1788 and ro15‐4513; substitutions at the adjacent alpha1s204 and alpha1t206 residues ( buhr  et al . 1997 ;  schaerer  et al . 1998 ;  casula  et al . 2001 ) alter the affinity of ro15‐1788 and ro15‐4513 by only ∼ 2–4‐fold. the considerable effect of the alpha1s205n substitution on  i ‐ xxxd1459xxx  affinity suggests a specific interaction of the alpha1ser205 residue with these ligands. as mutation at the homologous residue in the  xxxg835xxx  isoform did not change the affinity of ro15‐4513, there is an apparent differential contribution of this residue to  i ‐ xxxd1459xxx  binding at the ds and di subtypes.
          
 the results of the reciprocal  xxxg835xxx / xxxg830xxx  mutations emphasize the divergent requirements for ligand recognition at the di compared with the ds subtypes, in particular for ro15‐4513. several lines of evidence, including opposite efficacies at di and ds receptors ( hadingham  et al . 1996 ;  dunn  et al . 1999 ), suggest that ro15‐4513 interacts differently with each receptor subtype. distinct domains of alpha subunits are photolabeled by [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 in native bovine cortical ds receptors compared with cerebellar di receptors ( duncalfe and dunn 1996 ); however, this difference was not reproduced in recombinant receptors containing the  xxxg830xxx  or  xxxg835xxx  subunits ( davies  et al . 1996 ). the substrate of [ 3 h]ro15‐4513 labeling in cortical receptors has been mapped to the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 ( davies and dunn 1998 ), but more recent investigations have identified alpha1y209 (and the homologous tyrosine in the  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx  subunits) as a major site of ro15‐4513 labeling ( sawyer  et al . 2002 ). the proximity of this residue to alpha1s205 supports a role of this domain in the recognition of ro15‐4513 at  xxxg830xxx ‐containing receptors. determination of the site for covalent incorporation of ro15‐4513 into the  xxxg835xxx  (and  xxxg833xxx ) subunits remains to be determined.
          
 recent homology models of the  xxxd1459xxx  site based on the molluscan acetylcholine binding protein (achbp) ( brejc  et al . 2001 ) propose a specific orientation of ro15‐4513 within the binding cleft at the  xxxg830xxx – xxxg842xxx ‐subunit interface ( sawyer  et al . 2002 ;  kucken  et al . 2003 ) and predict the proximity of the photoreactive 8′‐azide for interaction with alpha1y209. ligand mapping modeling of the  xxxd1459xxx  pharmacophore predicts structural differences of the di  xxxd1459xxx  site, including a smaller binding pocket created with the  xxxg835xxx  isoform (e.g.  huang  et al . 2000 ;  he  et al . 2000 ). further predictions suggest that the 8′‐substituent of  i ‐ xxxd1459xxx  ligands underlies ds/di subtype selectivity and that the 8′‐azide moiety of ro15‐4513 must adopt different diastereomeric conformations for lowest energy docking within the ds and di binding sites ( wong  et al . 1993 ;  huang  et al . 2000 ). although the present mutational results cannot be directly compared with those from pharmacophore models, disparate effects of the alpha1s205n/alpha6n204s substitutions on ro15‐4513 binding are consistent with a differential interaction of the 8′‐azide with the loop c domain of the  xxxg216xxx  at ds and di subtypes.
          
 comparative modeling of the  xxxd1459xxx  site ( cromer  et al . 2002 ;  ernst  et al . 2003 ) suggests that, although there exists conservation of the overall hairpin structure of loop c, low sequence homology with the achbp ( brejc  et al . 2001 ) in this region leads to high model variability. in particular, the low homology prevents the exact placement of the preceding beta‐strand segment (beta9) and hampers the determination of the length of the bend (l10; centered on loop c) between the beta9 and beta10 structural beta strands of the proposed alpha‐subunit structure (see  fig. 2 ;  ernst  et al . 2003 ). as a consequence, a unified model across all alpha isoforms is not possible. the variable l10 region contains the identified alpha1s205/alpha6n204 divergence; structural differences in this region at di and ds  xxxd1459xxx  sites may underlie the disparate effects of substitution on ro15‐4513 recognition. additional residues from loop c that have been implicated in  xxxd1459xxx  ligand selectivity (see  sigel 2002 ) align to the beta‐sheet structures that flank the l10 hairpin, indicating a more complex region that influences the structure and pharmacology of the binding site. interestingly, inclusion of the chi207 subunit (with the crossover point in loop c) reduced the affinity of ro15‐4513 compared with that of either wild‐type di receptor, implying that the exact structure of this region influences ro15‐4513 recognition. the reduced affinity of ro15‐4513 at chi207‐containing receptors does not negate the usefulness of that chimeric subunit in identifying alpha6n204 as a mediator of beta‐carboline affinity at the di subtypes, and emphasizes the complex contributions to ligand recognition from multiple residues at the alpha–gamma‐subunit interface. further investigation of the differences in the binding sites produced with the different alpha isoforms (see  sigel 2002 ) is warranted to better understand ligand recognition, especially at the di  xxxd1459xxx  binding site.
