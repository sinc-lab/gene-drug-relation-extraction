we have investigated the regulation of hormone secretion from rat pancreatic islets by the
gabab receptors (gabab rs). inclusion of the specific gabab r antagonist cgp 55845 in
the extracellular medium increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion 1.6-fold but did
not affect the release of glucagon and somatostatin. conversely, addition of the gabab r
agonist baclofen inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by ∼60%. using rt-pcr,
transcription of gabab r1a-c,f and gabab r2 subunits was detected in beta-cells. measurements
of membrane currents and cell capacitance were applied to single beta-cells to investigate the
mechanisms by which gabab r activation inhibits insulin secretion. in perforated-patch
measurements, baclofen inhibited exocytosis elicited by 500-ms voltage-clamp depolarizations
to 0 mv by ≤ 80% and voltage-gated ca2 + entry by only ∼30%. both effects were
concentration-dependent with ic50 values of ∼2 µm. the inhibitory action of baclofen was
abolished in the presence of cgp 55845. the ability of baclofen to suppress exocytosis was prevented by pre-treatment with pertussis toxin and by inclusion of gdpbetas in the intracellular
medium, and became irreversible in the presence of gtpgammas as expected for a process involving
inhibitoryg-proteins(gi/o -proteins).theinhibitoryeffectofbaclofenresultedfromactivation
of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin and pre-treatment with  xxxd1781xxx 
or intracellular application of calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide abolished the effect. addition
of baclofen had no effect on [ca2 + ]i and electrical activity in glucose-stimulated beta-cells. these
data indicate that gaba released from beta-cells functions as an autocrine inhibitor of insulin
secretion in pancreatic islets and that the effect is principally due to direct suppression of
exocytosis.

pancreatic islets contain high levels of the inhibitory
neurotransmitter gamma - xxxd2177xxx  (gaba). gaba
is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in
the mammalian central nervous system (cns). three
types of gaba-receptors exist. in addition to the
iontropic gabaa - and gabac -receptors, which are
ligand-gated cl− channels, there are also metabotropic
g-protein-coupled gabab -receptors (gabab rs; chebib
& johnston, 1999). in neurones, gaba reduces electrical

excitability via both gabaa - and gabab -signalling and
by a combination of pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.
several cellular processes are influenced by gabab rs.
examples include inhibition of the voltage-gated ca2+
channels, modulation of the voltage dependence of a
transient a-type k+ current and activation of inwardly
rectifying k+ channels (for review see kerr & ong, 1995).
in addition, it has recently been reported that baclofen
reduces synaptic transmission by inhibition of vesicle
priming (sakaba & neher, 2003).
by contrast, the physiological roles of gaba in the
pancreatic islets are not fully understood. gaba is stored
in the beta-cell in synaptic-like microvesicles (slmvs), which

m. braun and others

accumulate gaba by active transport (thomas-reetz
et al. 1993). we have recently demonstrated that gaba
is released by regulated ca2+ -dependent exocytosis of the
slmvs (braun et al. 2004), and that gaba thus released
regulates glucagon secretion from neighbouring alpha-cells
by activation of gabaa -receptors (wendt et al. 2004).
however, there is also evidence suggesting that gabab rs
are expressed in pancreatic islet cells (brice et al. 2002)
and application of the gabab r agonist baclofen has been
reported to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion from
rat pancreatic islet (gu et al. 1993) and clonal min6-cells
(brice et al. 2002). here we have studied the expression
and function of gabab rs in rat pancreatic islets using a
combination of hormone release measurements, rt-pcr
analysis of gene transcription, recordings of the cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+ ]i ) and single-cell
measurements of exocytosis and voltage-gated ca2+
currents. we demonstrate that: (1) activation of gabab rs
selectively modulates insulin secretion from the pancreatic
islets and that release of glucagon and somatostatin is
not affected; (2) the effect of gaba on insulin secretion
involves inhibition of exocytosis at a late stage and is
independent of any changes in the intracellular camp
levels, ca2+ influx or [ca2+ ]i ; and (3) the inhibitory action
involves g protein-dependent activation of the protein
phosphatase calcineurin.
methods
preparation of rat alpha- and beta-cells

pancreatic islets and single alpha- and beta- cells were prepared
from sprague-dawley or wistar rats as previously
described for mice (olofsson et al. 2002). the rats were
anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (100 mg kg−1
i.p.) and killed by cervical dislocation or by inhalation
of co2 followed by cervical dislocation. all experimental
procedures involving animals were approved by the ethical
committees in lund, the city of hamburg and the
university of copenhagen. after excision of the pancreas,
islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and dispersed
into single cells essentially as detailed elsewhere (ämmälä
et al. 1993). the cells were plated on 35 mm diameter petri
dishes and incubated in a humidified atmosphere for up to
5 days in rpmi 1640 tissue culture medium (gibco brl,
life technologies ltd, paisley, uk) supplemented with
10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 i.u. ml−1
penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin.
one series of experiments (see fig. 7) was performed
on alpha-cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(facs; josefsen et al. 1996). based on the hormone
contents and their glucose sensitivities, we estimate
that the preparations contain > 80% alpha-cells and < 3%
beta-cells (josefsen et al. 1996; gromada et al. 1997). the
alpha-cells could be functionally distinguished from the beta-cells

by the presence of a prominent rapidly inactivating
na+ current and small cell size (cell capacitance
< 2.5 pf).
electrophysiology

patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (tip
resistance 3–4 m when filled with the pipette solution),
coated with sylgard and fire-polished before use. the
zero-current potential was adjusted before establishment
of the seal with the pipette in the bath. the holding
potential in all experiments was −70 mv.
exocytosis was monitored in single beta-cells as changes
in cell membrane capacitance using either the standard
or the perforated-patch whole-cell configuration. the
patch-clamp recordings were made using epc-7 (list
elektronik, darmstadt, germany; figs 3 and 5–7) or
epc-9 (heka electronics, lamprecht/pfalz, germany;
figs 4 and 8b) patch-clamp amplifiers. exocytosis was
elicited by 500-ms voltage-clamp depolarizations from
−70 to 0 mv. changes in cell capacitance were detected
using in-house software written in axobasic (axon
instruments, union city, ca, usa; ämmälä et al. 1993)
or the software pulse (heka, version 8.41). during the
electrophysiological experiments, the cells were placed in
an experimental chamber with a volume of 0.4 ml, which
was continuously superfused at a rate of 1.5 ml min−1
to maintain the temperature at 33◦ c. experiments
commenced when two successive depolarizations or trains
of pulses applied at a 1–2 min interval elicited exocytotic
responses of the same amplitude (± 10%) to ascertain
that the observed changes were not simply attributable to
spontaneous long-term changes of the secretory capacity.
membrane potential recordings (fig. 8b) were performed
in beta-cells in intact rat islets as previously described for
mouse islets (göpel et al. 1999).

the pipette solution for standard whole-cell
experiments (figs 5 and 6) contained (mm): caesium
glutamate 125, cscl 10, nacl 10, mgcl2 1, hepes 5,
egta 0.05, mgatp 3, camp 0.1 and gtp 0.01; ph was

to 7.35 with csoh or koh. electrical contact with the
cell interior was established by adding 0.24 mg ml−1

required a few minutes and the voltage clamp was
considered satisfactory when the series conductance
(g series ) was constant and exceeded 35–40 ns. the

mgcl2 1.2, cacl2 2.6, d-glucose 5 (figs 3–7) and hepes 5;
ph was adjusted to 7.40 using naoh. tea was included
to block outward rectifying k+ currents, which persist
even after replacement of intracellular k+ by cs+ . for
measuring glucose-induced electrical acitivity (fig. 8b),
tea was replaced by an equal concentration of nacl,
and the glucose concentration was increased to 20 mm.
 xxxd1742xxx  (2 µm) was included in the extracellular
solution in all experiments involving measurements of
exocytosis in intact beta-cells (perforated-patch recordings)
to increase the exocytotic capacity. calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide was supplied by calbiochem (la jolla,
ca, usa) and cgp 55845 was purchased from tocris
(bristol, uk). all other chemicals were purchased from
sigma.
measurements of [ca2 + ]i

the [ca2+ ]i measurements in single cells (fig. 3) were
made using an axiovert 135 inverted microscope equipped
with a plan-neofluar × 100, 1.30 na objective (carl zeiss,
oberkochen, germany) and an ionoptix (milton, ma,
usa) fluorescence imaging system as described elsewhere
(bokvist et al. 1995). the experiments were conducted
using the perforated-patch whole-cell configuration with
the pipette-filling solution specified above. prior to the
experiments, the cells were loaded with the acetoxymethyl
ester of fura-2 (fura-2 am; 0.2 µm; molecular probes,
eugene, or, usa) for 16–18 min. calibration of the
fluorescence ratios was performed using the standard
whole-cell configuration to infuse fura-2 am with
different mixtures of ca2+ and egta to obtain a known
[ca2+ ]i .
[ca2+ ]i in intact islets (fig. 8a) was recorded by
dual-wavelength microfluorimetry using a  xxxd104xxx  pti
microfluorimetry system (monmouth junction, nj, usa)
as described elsewhere (olofsson et al. 2002). in short,
the cells were loaded with 3 µm fura-2 am in the
presence of 0.007% w/v pluronic acid (molecular probes)
at 37◦ c for 30–40 min prior to measurements. during
the experiment, the islet was continuously superfused
with a solution containing (mm): nacl 140, kcl 3.6,
nahco3 2, nah2 po4 0.5,  xxxd2534xxx  0.5, hepes 5, cacl2 2.6
and glucose 5 or 15; ph was adjusted to 7.4 with
naoh.

and the atp-dependent k+ (katp ) channel blocker
 xxxd3394xxx  (sigma, st louis, mo, usa) were included
in the extracellular medium as indicated. at the end
of the incubation, duplicate aliquots (25–100 µl) of
the medium were removed and frozen pending the
radioimmunoassays.

total rna from rat islets and from facs purified rat alphaand beta-cells was isolated using rneasy mini kit (qiagen).
total rna 1 µg was used for reverse transcription using
random hexamer primers and superscript ii (invitrogen).
in a negative control superscript ii was omitted from
the reaction. pcr was performed under the following

hormone release measurements

data analysis

insulin, glucagon and somatostatin release were
determined by radioimmunoassay (ria) as described
elsewhere (vonen et al. 1989; salehi et al. 1999). briefly,
batches of 8–10 islets were pre-incubated in 1 ml of
krebs-ringer buffer (krb) supplemented with 1 mm

results are presented as means ± s.e.m. for the indicated
number of experiments. significant differences were
evaluated using student’s t test for paired data except
for fig. 1 where student’s t test for unpaired data was

gabab r antagonism increases glucose-induced
insulin secretion but has no effect on glucagon
and somatostatin release

to study the involvement of gabab rs in the regulation
of hormone release from isolated rat pancreatic islets,
we used the gabab r antagonist cgp 55845 (fig. 1a).
increasing glucose from 1 mm to 20 mm stimulated
insulin secretion 15-fold. addition of cgp 55845 resulted
in a further 61% enhancement of glucose-induced
insulin secretion whereas basal release was not affected.
glucagon secretion was suppressed by glucose (−38%)
but it was not affected by gabab r antagonism. finally,
glucose stimulated somatostatin release 5.1-fold. neither
basal, nor glucose-induced somatostatin secretion were
affected by the antagonist. it should be noted that the
observed effects of cgp 55845 in these experiments
are likely to reflect the removal of gabab r-signalling
due to endogenous gaba as no exogenous gaba was
added.

j physiol 559.2

the gabab r agonist baclofen inhibits
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion

we next tested the effects of the selective gabab r agonist
baclofen on insulin and glucagon secretion (fig. 1b). basal
insulin secretion was unaffected by 10 µm baclofen. in
this series of experiments, glucose (20 mm) stimulated
insulin secretion 13-fold. the latter effect was partially
suppressed (−63%) by baclofen. the inhibitory action of
baclofen on glucose-induced insulin secretion was fully
antagonized by the gabab r antagonist cgp 55845. it
is important that the amount of insulin secreted in the
presence of baclofen, cgp 55845 and 20 mm glucose is less
than that released from islets exposed to glucose and cgp
55845 (compare fig. 1a and b). the  xxxg1253xxx  blocker
 xxxd3394xxx  stimulated insulin secretion in excess of that
elicited by glucose alone (+55%). baclofen remained
capable of inhibiting insulin secretion under the latter
conditions but the effect was limited to a reduction by 23%.
whereas 20 mm glucose inhibited glucagon secretion by
∼50%, addition of baclofen had no statistically significant
effect on glucagon secretion (fig. 1b). taken together,

gabab receptors and pancreatic islet function

the hormone release measurements suggest that gabab r
activation selectively modulates insulin secretion and that
it has no effect on the release of the two other major islet
hormones.
expression of gabab rs in pancreatic islet cells

we explored expression of metabotropic gabab r
isoforms in rat islets and purified rat alpha- and beta-cells
(fig. 2a). we thus confirmed expression of gabab r1a
and/or gabab r1b and gabab r2 in pancreatic islets. we
also observed expression of gabab r1c and/or gabab r1f .
the same expression pattern was observed for whole rat
islets, purified rat alpha-cells and purified rat beta-cells. both
alpha- and beta-cell cdna preparations were checked for purity
using insulin and glucagon primers in a separate multiplex
rt-pcr (fig. 2b). insulin and glucagon mrnas were only
detected in the beta- and alpha-cell fractions, respectively.

concentration-dependent. little inhibition of exocytosis
was observed at 0.3 µm baclofen, and 10 µm produced
maximal inhibition. approximating the mean data points
to the hill equation yielded a half-maximal inhibition of
1.7 µm and co-operativity factor of 1.1. our value for
the ic50 of baclofen-induced inhibition of exocytosis in
beta-cells (1.7 µm) is close to the 0.8 µm obtained for the
inhibition of neurotransmitter release in the calyx of held
(takahashi et al. 1998). similarly, the integrated ca2+
current was half-maximally inhibited by baclofen at a
concentration of 1.6 µm (not shown).

the gabab r agonist baclofen inhibits
depolarization-evoked exocytosis in rat beta-cells

figure 3a shows parallel recordings of ca2+ current (i ca ),
associated increase in cytoplasmic free ca2+ concentration
([ca2+ ]i ) and exocytosis ( c m ) in a single rat beta-cell
in response to 500-ms depolarization from −70 mv to
0 mv applied at 2 min intervals. under control conditions,
the depolarization evoked an integrated ca2+ current
of ∼7 pc, produced a [ca2+ ]i increase from a basal
concentration of 0.1 µm to a peak concentration of
∼1 µm and a elicited a capacitance increase of ∼80 ff.
following the addition of 10 µm baclofen to activate
the gabab r, both the ca2+ current and the associated
increase in [ca2+ ]i were moderately (∼20%) reduced,
whereas exocytosis was more strongly (83%) inhibited.
all the effects of baclofen were readily reversible and
4 min after the removal of the agonist, the parameters had
returned to their control values.
in a series of six experiments, the average inhibition of
exocytosis produced by baclofen amounted to 79 ± 14%
(p < 0.01; fig. 3b). the effect was associated with
an average reduction of the integrated ca2+ current
(qca ) of 28 ± 9% and a decrease in the amplitude of
the depolarization-evoked peak [ca2+ ]i ( [ca2+ ]i ) of
22 ± 8%. all effects were reversed upon withdrawal of
baclofen. the inhibition of exocytosis in beta-cells produced
by baclofen is comparable to the reduction of neurotransmitter release at the calyx of held (takahashi et al.
1998; sakaba & neher, 2003).

the inhibitory action of baclofen is antagonized
by cgp 55845

we next ascertained that cgp 55845 is capable
of antagonizing the inhibitory action of baclofen
on exocytosis. exocytosis was elicited by 500-ms
depolarizations from −70 mv to 0 mv, applied at 2-min
intervals. figure 4a shows recordings of exocytosis (from
left to right) under control conditions, after addition of
baclofen, following washout of baclofen, after application
of cgp 55845 alone and in the combined presence of

j physiol 559.2

cgp 55845 and baclofen. it can be seen that whereas
baclofen in this experiment inhibited exocytosis by ∼70%
when applied on its own, it lacked inhibitory action in
the presence of the antagonist. data from a series of seven
experiments are summarized in fig. 4b.
the inhibitory action of baclofen on exocytosis is
mediated by activation of an inhibitory g-protein

the  xxxg828xxx  is a member of the large group
of g protein-linked membrane receptors. we made use

of the standard whole-cell configuration, which has the
advantage of permitting the cell interior to be dialysed
by the pipette solution (hamill et al. 1981), to elucidate
the involvement of g proteins in the effects of baclofen
on exocytosis. figure 5a demonstrates that the ability
of baclofen to inhibit exocytosis is maintained in the
standard whole-cell configuration and when the intracellular camp levels are clamped at 0.1 mm. in a series
of six experiments, 10 µm baclofen reversibly inhibited
exocytosis ( c m ) elicited by individual 500-ms pulses
from −70 mv to 0 mv by 82 ± 13% (fig. 5e). consistent
with the involvement of an inhibitory g protein (gi/o ),
the ability of baclofen to inhibit exocytosis was lost
following overnight treatment with 100 ng ml−1 pertussis
toxin (fig. 5b and e) or when 0.5 mm of the stable gdp
analogue gdpbetas was included in the intracellular solution
(fig. 5c and e). by contrast, when the experiment was
conducted in the intracellular presence of 100 µm gtpgamma s
(a stable gtp analogue that causes irreversible activation
of the gtp-binding proteins), application of baclofen
resulted in permanent inhibition of exocytosis (fig. 5d
and e).
baclofen mediates its inhibitory action on exocytosis
via activation of calcineurin

we have previously reported that the inhibitory action of
somatostatin, galanin and adrenaline on exocytosis from
beta-cells is secondary to activation of the serine/threonine
protein phosphatase calcineurin (renström et al. 1996a).
we explored whether this also applies to baclofen-induced
inhibition of exocytosis. indeed, baclofen failed to suppress
exocytosis following inhibition of calcineurin with  xxxd1781xxx  (1 µm for > 20 min; fig. 6a). a similar abolition
was observed after intracellular application (through

the patch electrode during whole-cell recordings) of
calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (100 µm), which is a
highly selective inhibitor of calcineurin (perrino et al.
1995) (fig. 6b). exocytosis measured after addition
of baclofen averaged 87 ± 18% (n = 5) and 89 ± 13%
(n = 5) of that observed under control conditions when
the experiments were conducted in the presence of
 xxxd1781xxx  and calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide,
respectively. under otherwise identical experimental
conditions but in the absence of the calcineurin
inhibitors, baclofen suppressed exocytosis by ∼80%
(fig. 5a).
baclofen does not inhibit adrenaline-stimulated
exocytosis in alpha-cells

we have previously reported that somatostatin in addition
to its effects on beta-cells (renström et al. 1996a) also
inhibits exocytosis in alpha-cells by a g protein-mediated
action involving activation of calcineurin (gromada
et al. 2001). given the similarity between the effects of
somatostatin and baclofen in beta-cells and the detection
of gabab r mrna in the alpha-cell fraction (fig. 2), we
next investigated the ability of baclofen to modulate
exocytosis in rat alpha-cells exposed to adrenaline (fig. 7).
in a series of five experiments, adrenaline increased
exocytosis by 312 ± 31% (p < 0.01), an effect that was
associated with a moderate increase in the integrated
ca2+ current (40 ± 17%; p < 0.01). baclofen had no
effect on either parameter, and the mean amplitude of
the exocytotic responses was 95 ± 9% (n = 5) of that
observed in the presence of adrenaline alone. the failure
of baclofen to affect exocytosis is in agreement with
the lack of effect of the agonist on glucagon secretion
(fig. 1).

baclofen has no effect on [ca2+ ]i or beta-cell electrical
activity in intact islets

to investigate the effect of gabab r stimulation on ca2+
signalling we measured [ca2+ ]i in glucose stimulated islets
before and after the addition of baclofen (fig. 8a). the
agonist was added to the islet in the steady state after a
regular [ca2+ ]i oscillatory pattern had established. in a
series of nine experiments, the fura-2 am fluorescence (f)
ratio at 350 and 380 nm (f 350 /f 380 ), as a measure of [ca2+ ]i ,
was 0.71 ± 0.02 in the presence of 5 mm glucose. in the
presence of 15 mm glucose, the average ratio before
addition of baclofen was 0.83 ± 0.03. f 350 /f 380 was
0.85 ± 0.03 4 min after addition of baclofen, and
0.86 ± 0.03 4 min after washout. oscillations in [ca2+ ]i
were observed in 8 out of 9 islets. the oscillations
were temporary in six islets and stable throughout
the experiment in two islets (see also fig. 8a). no
consistent correlation between addition of baclofen and
the appearance or disappearance of oscillations or the
oscillatory pattern was observed.
we also investigated the effect of baclofen on beta-cell
membrane potential. recordings were performed in the
perforated-patch whole cell configuration on functionally
identified beta-cells in intact rat islets. electrical activity

gabab receptors and pancreatic islet function

was elicited by increasing the glucose concentration of
the extracellular medium from 3 to 20 mm. application
of baclofen had no effect on action potential firing
and membrane potential (fig. 8b; n = 5). in the same
experiments the membrane conductance, principally
reflecting  xxxg1253xxx  activity, was 1.24 ± 0.16 ns in the
presence of 20 mm glucose alone and 1.35 ± 0.11 ns after
addition of baclofen (n.s.; n = 5).
discussion
pancreatic islet cells interact with each other via hormonal
and electrical signals. it is well established that the blood
sugar-regulating hormones also act as paracrine/autocrine
regulators of hormone release from islets (samols et al.
1986). in addition to peptide hormones, islet cells contain
and release several other bioactive compounds, including
classical neurotransmitters, which constitute potential
local signalling molecules (hayashi et al. 2003; rorsman
& renström, 2003). we have recently demonstrated that
ca2+ -dependent exocytosis of the slmvs leads to gaba
release into the islet interstitium that, via activation
of ionotropic gabaa receptors in the alpha-cells, inhibits
glucagon secretion (braun et al. 2004; wendt et al. 2004).
in this paper we focus on the possible role of metabotropic
gabab receptors in the regulation of pancreatic hormone
secretion.

405

beta-cells has an interstitial volume of 0.1 nl. an average
interstitial concentration of 1 µm will accordingly arise if
as little as 250 slmvs are released in the entire islet (i.e. 0.25
slmv per beta-cell). for comparison, the basal rate of gaba
release has been estimated to be one vesicle per second
(smismans et al. 1997), and the release rate increases up to
10-fold upon stimulation (braun et al. 2004). even when
allowance is made for the fact that baclofen is more potent
than gaba (takahashi et al. 1998), these considerations
make it likely that physiologically relevant concentrations
of gaba do indeed occur in the islet interstitium during
beta-cell electrical activity. the fact that neither glucagon, nor
somatostatin secretion was affected under these conditions
suggests that the effect on insulin secretion was indeed
mediated by activation of gabab rs and not unspecific
interactions with other effector proteins. the failure to
demonstrate an effect of baclofen on hormone release
from mouse islets in an earlier study (gilon et al. 1991)
possibly reflects the low gaba concentration found in
mouse islets (michalik & erecinska, 1992). thus, the
importance of gabaergic signalling in islets is likely to
vary between different species. it may seem surprising
that cgp 55845 has no effect on depolarization-evoked
exocytosis (fig. 4a and b). this we attribute to gaba
being quickly diluted/washed away in the experiments on
isolated beta-cells, whereas it is trapped in the interstitium
in the insulin release experiments conducted on intact
pancreatic islets.

endogenous gaba release selectively modulates
insulin secretion in intact islets

the gabab r antagonist cgp 55845 when added on
its own stimulated glucose-induced insulin secretion
whilst not affecting glucagon and somatostatin secretion
(fig. 1a). the fact that the antagonist was effective suggests
that biologically active concentrations of gaba are
present in the islet interstitium. the observed 1.6-fold
enhancement of glucose-induced insulin secretion can be
used to estimate the interstitial gaba concentration. as
shown in fig. 3c, exocytosis is influenced by baclofen in
a concentration-dependent fashion with an ic50 value
of ∼2 µm. if we assume that insulin secretion in the
intact islet and in the presence of the antagonist is
equivalent to exocytosis measured in isolated beta-cells in
the complete absence of gaba, then we can estimate that
the average interstitial concentration of gaba experienced
by the beta-cell in situ is equivalent to 2 µm baclofen
(75 ff/1.6 = 48 ff; see dotted line in fig. 3c). we have
estimated the intravesicular gaba content to be 0.4 amol
(braun et al. 2004). a pancreatic beta-cell has a volume of
∼1 pl (estimated using spherical geometry and a diameter
of 12 µm). if we assume that the interstitial space is about
10% of the intracellular volume as suggested by electron
microscopy (dean, 1973), then an islet containing 1000

mechanisms of baclofen action

it has been reported that baclofen leads to a reduction
in the cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration in rat beta-cells
(gu et al. 1993). we did not observe any effect
of baclofen on the glucose-induced ca2+ signal in
islets (fig. 8a). accordingly, baclofen had no effect on
glucose-induced electrical activity and katp currents
measured in beta-cells in intact islets (fig. 8b). this suggests
that baclofen, unlike other inhibitory agonists (rorsman
et al. 1991; renström et al. 1996a), does not inhibit insulin
secretion by influencing electrical activity and cytoplasmic
ca2+ signalling.
in the calyx of held, acute inhibition of synaptic
transmission by baclofen has been found to be
principally determined by the suppression of pre-synaptic
ca2+ entry, and exocytosis itself is unaffected (takahashi
et al. 1998). it is unlikely that the small decrease in
ca2+ current we observe is responsible for the inhibition
of exocytosis. indeed, reducing the beta-cell ca2+ current by
20–25% only marginally reduces the exocytotic responses
(renström et al. 1996b). we therefore conclude that
more distal actions are responsible for the suppression of
exocytosis in the beta-cell. recently, it has been demonstrated
that activation of gabab rs also interferes with the
replenishment of the ‘readily releasable pool’ (rrp) of

j physiol 559.2

synaptic vesicles (sakaba & neher, 2003). in the present
study, baclofen inhibited exocytosis elicited by individual
pulses, which principally reflects release of rrp granules
(renström et al. 1997; barg et al. 2001). this suggests that
the effect of baclofen is exerted distal to granule priming
in beta-cells. given the similarities of exocytosis in various
cells, it is possible that a direct effect on the exocytotic
process itself also contributes to gabab r modulation
of synaptic transmission; however, this remains to be
confirmed experimentally.
considering that baclofen appears to inhibit insulin
secretion via a direct effect on exocytosis, it was
surprising that the  xxxg1253xxx  blocker  xxxd3394xxx 
(which acts via increasing electrical activity and [ca2+ ]i )
partially antagonized the inhibitory effect of baclofen
on insulin secretion (fig. 1b). sulphonylureas have been
shown to stimulate exocytosis in beta-cells not only via
closure of katp channels, but also by a direct effect
on insulin granule exocytosis (eliasson et al. 1996).
 xxxd3394xxx  might therefore counteract the baclofen
effect via a direct effect on the secretory machinery.
alternatively, the ability of  xxxd3394xxx  to antagonize
the inhibitory action of baclofen may be apparent. the
stimulatory effect of the gabab antagonist cgp 55845
on insulin secretion (fig. 1a) indicates the presence
of a substantial concentration of gaba in the

islet interstitium. compared to 20 mm glucose alone,
 xxxd3394xxx  further increased insulin secretion ∼1.6-fold,
and a similar effect can be expected on gaba release
from beta-cells (braun et al. 2004). it is therefore conceivable
that release of endogenous gaba is sufficient to
achieve near saturation of the gabab r and addition
of baclofen therefore only leads to a moderate further
reduction.

baclofen mediates its inhibitory action by activation
of the protein phosphatase calcineurin

as camp has been shown to enhance ca2+ -dependent
exocytosis in beta-cells by both  xxxg1836xxx 
(pka)-dependent and pka-independent mechanisms,
it could be argued that suppression of exocytosis
by baclofen results from gi/o -mediated reduction of
adenylate cyclase activity (kerr & ong, 1995; bowery
et al. 2002). although we cannot exclude the possibility
that baclofen inhibits adenylate cyclase in beta-cells, the
finding that the inhibitory action of baclofen persisted
in standard whole-cell recordings when the cytoplasmic
camp concentration was clamped at 100 µm by inclusion
of the nucleotide in the pipette solution, argues that
inhibition of camp generation is not required for the effect
on exocytosis. our data instead suggest that the ability
of baclofen to inhibit ca2+ -dependent exocytosis involves
activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin. these
results are consistent with the results previously obtained
in mouse pancreatic beta-cells (renström et al. 1996a),
rat alpha-cells (gromada et al. 2001), bovine chromaffin
cells (craig et al. 2003) and nerve terminals (hens
et al. 1998). the data underscore the importance of
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in the control of
exocytosis in a variety of secretory cells and suggest that the
actions of the inhibitors converge at calcineurin. clearly, it
is now important to identify the molecular target involved.
recent observations made in chromaffin cells suggest
that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of  xxxg2182xxx  by
pka/calcineurin determines vesicle release competence
(nagy et al. 2004).

gabab rs in alpha-cells

in rt-pcr experiments, expression of gabab r
subunit mrna was detected in both purified beta-cells
and alpha-cells (fig. 2). however, baclofen neither affected
glucagon secretion from isolated islets (fig. 1) nor
adrenaline-stimulated exocytosis in single alpha-cells (fig. 7).
we have previously shown that the effects of adrenaline on
exocytosis in alpha-cells are mimicked by  xxxd1742xxx  (gromada
et al. 1997), which suggests that the experiments on
alpha- and beta-cells were conducted under comparable
conditions. the reason for the discrepancy between gene

c the physiological society 2004

407

expression and function in alpha-cells is not clear. although
gene expression is commonly regulated at the level of
mrna synthesis, it is also known to be controlled at
more distal stages such as rna transport and localization,
mrna translation or protein activity. another possible
explanation is that we have only examined exocytosis of
glucagon in this study. therefore we can not rule out
the possibility that gabab rs regulate other processes in
alpha-cells such as the release of slmvs (yamada et al. 2001).
the exocytosis of these vesicles would contribute little to
the capacitance changes (< 1%; cf. braun et al. 2004) and
therefore easily escape detection.

physiological significance of autocrine suppression
of insulin secretion

pancreatic beta-cells are constantly exposed to the microenvironment within the islet. the cells are exposed to the
secretions of the neighbouring alpha- and delta-cells, including
the islet hormones glucagon and somatostatin that
exert strong effects on insulin secretion (pipeleers et al.
1985a,b). exocytosis of the insulin granules is associated
with the co-release of adenine nucleotides, which have
been reported to activate katp channels and inhibit
exocytosis in beta-cells (poulsen et al. 1999). it is also
surprising that insulin itself has been reported to suppress
beta-cell electrical activity at concentrations only slightly
higher than those found in the plasma (khan et al. 2001;
persaud et al. 2002). here we demonstrate that gaba
by activation of gabab rs inhibits insulin secretion by
suppression of exocytosis. together these mechanisms
provide powerful feedback systems safeguarding against
hypoglycaemia and may contribute to the pulsatility of
insulin secretion in vivo.
