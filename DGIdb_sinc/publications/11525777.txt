cyclooxygenase selectivity of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs in humans: ex vivo evaluation.  we have recently described a novel assay to assess ex vivo the activity and selectivity on  xxxg1883xxx  and -2 (ec 1.14.99.1) of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) administered to rats [br. j. pharmacol. 126 (1999) 1824.]. here, we have extended these studies to humans. healthy male volunteers were given orally one of the following drugs (mg) for 5 days:  xxxd2065xxx  (200 or 400 b.i.d.),  xxxd2561xxx  (7.5 or 15 q.d.),  xxxd2727xxx  (100 or 200 b.i.d.),  xxxd2688xxx  (500 or 1000 b.i.d.) or naproxen (500 b.i.d.). blood samples were withdrawn from the volunteers before and up to 24 h after the last dose. plasma obtained from the blood was tested for its ability to inhibit prostanoid formation in interleukin-1beta-treated a549 cells ( xxxg1884xxx  system) and human washed platelets ( xxxg1883xxx  system). plasma from  xxxd2065xxx -treated subjects demonstrated a slight selectivity towards the inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx . this effect was more prominent in plasma from subjects receiving  xxxd2561xxx  or  xxxd2727xxx . plasma from  xxxd2688xxx -treated subjects showed no or little selectivity towards  xxxg1883xxx  depending on the dose of drug administered, while plasma taken from subjects receiving naproxen was more active at inhibiting  xxxg1883xxx  than  xxxg1884xxx . in conclusion, we have demonstrated that this assay can be used to assess ex vivo the relative activity against  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  of nsaids consumed by human volunteers. it is to be hoped that data from such systems will aid in our understanding of the relationships between the differential inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  by nsaids and their reported efficacies and (gastrointestinal) toxicities.
