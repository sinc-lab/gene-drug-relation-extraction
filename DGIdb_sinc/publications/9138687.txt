1 the a1-adrenoceptor population mediating contraction of caudal artery of rat has been characterized
by using quantitative receptor pharmacology.
2 cumulative concentration-eect (e/[a]) curves to noradrenaline (na) yielded a p[a]50 of 5.56+0.05
(n=16).  xxxd3000xxx  caused concentration-dependent, parallel, dextral shifts of e/[a] curves to na yielding
a pkb of 8.9 (schild regression slope=1.0). rs-17053 (n-[2-(2-cyclopropyl methoxy phenoxy) ethyl]-5chloro-a ,a-dimethyl -1h-indole- 3-ethanamine hydrochloride; 10 ± 100 nm), a selective a1a-adrenoceptor
antagonist, produced non-parallel, biphasic, dextral shifts of e/[a] curves to na, suggesting the
involvement of more than one a1-adrenoceptor subtype. analysis of the high anity component yielded
an apparent pa2 value of 9.2+0.3.
3 a-61603, a selective agonist at a1a adrenoceptors behaved as a full agonist relative to na and yielded
monophasic e/[a] curves with a p[a50] of 7.59+0.04 (n=15). pretreatment of tissues with
chloroethylclonidine (cec; 100 mm for 20 min, followed by 40 min washout), which preferentially
alkylates a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptors, did not alter e/[a] curves to a-61603.  xxxd3000xxx  (3 ± 300 nm) caused
concentration-dependent, parallel, dextral shifts of e/[a] curves to a-61603 yielding a pa2 estimate of
9.2+0.2.
4 experiments with a1-adrenoceptor antagonists of varying subtype selectivities (rs-17053, snap
5089, tamsulosin, 5-methylurapidil, bmy 7378, hv 723 and rec 15/2739) revealed parallel dextral
shifts of e/[a] curves to a-61603. schild regression analyses yielded pa2 estimates of 9.2, 9.3, 11.2, 9.0,
6.3, 8.7 and 10.0 for rs-17053, snap 5089, tamsulosin, 5-methylurapidil, bmy 7378, hv 723 and rec
15/2739, respectively, although deviations from unit slope (possibly re¯ecting a secondary involvement of
another a1-adrenoceptor) hindered estimations of pkb for some antagonists. the antagonist anity
pro®le obtained re¯ects best that described for the a1a-adrenoceptor.
5 in conclusion, caudal artery of rat contracts in response to na via activation of at least two a1adrenoceptor subtypes. one of these subtypes displays the pharmacology of the a1a-adrenoceptor, while
the other remains to be de®ned. use of the novel selective agonist, a-61603, allows for limited
pharmacological isolation of the a1a-adrenoceptor permitting characterization of the properties of
selective antagonists.

introduction
for over a decade, pharmacological studies have demonstrated
heterogeneity among a1-adrenoceptors, prompting regular revisions to classi®cation schemes (see ford et al., 1994; bylund
et al., 1994). currently, classi®cation of a1-adrenoceptors recognises three subtypes (a1a, a1b, and a1d; hieble et al., 1995a).
in addition, the existence of a fourth a1-adrenoceptor, the
putative a1l-adrenoceptor (muramatsu et al 1990a,b; oshita et
al., 1993), has been proposed on the basis of functional studies,
although a molecular biological correlate (e.g., distinct gene)
for this adrenoceptor is lacking.
particular interest has focused recently on the identity of the
a1-adrenoceptor which functions to contract smooth muscle of
the human lower urinary tract (prostate, bladder neck and
urethra; see review, hieble et al., 1995b). several groups claim
that the a1a-adrenoceptor is involved, especially as its mrna
predominates in these tissues (faure et al., 1994; forray et al.,
1994; marshall et al., 1995). others contend that the a1ladrenoceptor is involved. this contention is based on low af®nity estimates for several antagonists, including  xxxd3000xxx ,
snap 5089 and rs 17053 (muramatsu et al., 1994; ford et al.,
1996a). these probes serve to distinguish the a1l-adrenoceptor

neurobiology unit, roche bioscience, 3401 hillview avenue, palo
alto, ca 94304, u.s.a.

from the a1a-adrenoceptor. however, the validity of this distinction for tissues of the human lower urinary tract rests on
experiments done solely in isolated tissue baths (`static' tissue
preparations). consequently, it has been argued that the usefulness of these de®ning pharmacological probes ( xxxd3000xxx ,
snap 5089, rs 17053, etc.) should be con®rmed by an a1aadrenoceptor bioassay performed under identical methodological conditions (cumulative concentration-eect (e/[a])
curves in a tissue bath).
a functional bioassay for the a1a-adrenoceptor was ®rst
described in the rat vas deferens (han et al., 1987; aboud et al.,
1993; burt et al., 1995). however, despite being performed in
static tissue baths, this assay is not ideal as contractile responses to noradrenaline (na) are complex and phasic, and
analyses are limited to construction of non-cumulative e/[a]
curves. high anity competitive antagonists such as tamsulosin cause suppression of curve maxima (apparent insurmountability) under these conditions (furukawa et al.,
1995b), precluding anity determinations. furthermore, evidence exists to question whether a singular, homogeneous a1aadrenoceptor population functions in this tissue (ohmura et
al., 1992). functional a1a-adrenoceptor populations have been
de®ned more thoroughly in perfused vascular beds from rat,
including isolated kidney (eltze & boer 1992; blue et al., 1995)
and isolated mesentery (williams & clarke, 1995). however,
these assays are methodologically quite dissimilar to those

820

w.g. lachnit et al

performed on tissues from human lower urinary tract making
direct comparisons dicult. in addition, as these functional
assays only allow construction of non-cumulative e/[a] curves,
their suitability for analysis of high anity antagonists (e.g.,
tamsulosin, s-niguldipine) is limited (blue et al., 1995). indeed,
consideration of the literature reveals that an unequivocal a1aadrenoceptor, in a static tissue bath preparation, has not been
described. in this regard, we now describe studies using helical
strips of caudal artery of rat in isolated tissue baths and cumulative e/[a] curves. although it has been shown previously
that noradrenaline (na) mediates contraction in this blood
vessel by activation of more than one a1-adrenoceptor subtype
(medgett & langer, 1984) as well as putative activation of
postjunctional a2-adrenoceptors (templeton et al., 1989; maclean & mcgrath, 1990), a comprehensive characterization
with a range of subtype-selective pharmacological probes has
not been described.
the results indicate that caudal artery of rat contracts in
response to na via activation of at least two a1-adrenoceptor
subtypes, one of which displays the pharmacology of the a1aadrenoceptor. use of the novel selective a1a-adrenoceptor
agonist, a-61603, allowed for partial pharmacological isolation (30 fold window) of this receptor for analytical studies.
data obtained with a-61603 con®rm the usefulness of antagonists such as rs-17053 and snap 5089 for the pharmacological characterization of a1-adrenoceptors (most notably
distinguishing a1l- and a1a-adrenoceptors) in `static' tissue
bath preparations. a preliminary account of some of these
studies has been presented previously (lachnit et al., 1995).

methods
tissue preparation
male sprague dawley rats (200 ± 350 g) were killed by asphyxiation with co2. the caudal artery was removed carefully
and cleaned of adhering tissue. the endothelium was removed
and the artery cut into helical strips (5 ± 10 mm long, 1 ± 2 mm
wide). strips were suspended in waterjacketed tissue baths
(378c) for measurement of isometric tension in oxygenated
(95% o2, 5% co2) krebs solution containing (mm): na+
143.5, k+ 6.0, ca2+ 2.5, mg2+ 1.2, cl7 125.8, hco37 25,
h2po47 1.2, so427 1.2, supplemented with 100 mm ascorbate
(to minimize oxidation of na), 30 mm cocaine, 30 mm corticosterone (to block neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of na,
respectively), 10 mm indomethacin (to inhibit prostanoid production), 1 mm propranolol (to block b-adrenoceptors), and
300 nm idazoxan (to block a2-adrenoceptors). resting tension
was set at approximately 4 mn at the beginning of the experiment and tissues were equilibrated for 30 min.

agonist studies
following the construction of a concentration-eect curve to
na (cumulative addition in 0.5 log m increments) and a
45 min washout period, concentration-eect curves to agonists
were obtained by cumulative addition (0.5 log increments) of
agonist.

antagonist studies
with the exception of chloroethylclonidine (cec), all experiments with antagonists were performed as follows. following
construction of a control agonist concentration-eect curve,
each tissue was incubated for 60 min with antagonist. a second curve to the agonist was then constructed.

inactivation studies
experiments with cec were performed as follows. after
construction of a control concentration-eect curve to na or
a-61603, each tissue was incubated with cec (100 mm) for

a1a-adrenoceptor in caudal artery of rat

20 min. tissues were then washed regularly for 40 min before
construction of a second concentration-eect curve to either
na or a-61603.

data analysis
concentration-eect curves were plotted by use of non-linear
iterative curve-®tting methodologies to a form of the logistic
equation for estimation of mid-point location parameter
([a]50), such that e=emax . [a]nh/([a]nh+[a]50nh), where emax
is the magnitude of the upper asymptote and nh is the hill
coecient (de®ning the slope of the relationship). antagonist
anity estimates (as pkb or pa2) were obtained by construction of schild regressions, except in the case of rs-17053
versus na, which was obtained by `single-concentration'
analysis (assuming a schild regression slope of 1) according to
the equation: pa2=7log[b]+log ( xxxd1097xxx ), where [b] is molar
concentration of antagonist, and r is the ratio of [a]50 in the
presence of rs-17053 divided by that obtained in the absence
of rs-17053. wherever possible, estimates of r used in schild
regressions were corrected for variations in tissue sensitivity to
agonist over time. data presented are means+s.e.mean and n
represents number of tissues. all terms and equations used in
this study are in accordance with iuphar guidelines (jenkinson et al., 1995).

from research biochemicals inc. (natick, ma, u.s.a.). (+)noradrenaline hydrochloride, (+)-propranolol hydrochloride,

(ym 617) were synthesized in the chemistry department at
roche bioscience (palo alto, ca, u.s.a.). solutions were
prepared in deionized water or dimethylsulphoxide (corticosterone,  xxxd3000xxx , rs-17053, tamsulosin, hv-723, rec 15/
2739, snap 5089, 5-methyl urapidil, and (+)-sdz nvi 085).
the ®nal concentration of dimethylsulphoxide in the bathing
solution did not exceed 0.1% and had no eect on muscle
contraction.

results
increasing concentrations (0.5 log increments) of na produced sustained concentration-dependent increases in tension
in caudal artery of rat. e/[a] curves were monophasic
(nh=1.0+0.07) and yielded a p[a]50 estimate for na of
5.56+0.05 (mean+s.e.mean; n=16).  xxxd3000xxx  (3 ± 300 nm)
produced parallel dextral shifts of e/[a] curves to na without
a change in maxima (figure 1a). schild regression analysis
yielded a slope of 1.0 and a pkb estimate of 8.9 (figure 1b). in

w.g. lachnit et al

contrast to  xxxd3000xxx , rs 17053 (10, 30 and 100 nm), a novel,
selective a1a-adrenoceptor antagonist (ford et al., 1996a),
produced surmountable non-parallel, dextral shifts of e/[a]
curves to na, which could be resolved into two sites by use of
biphasic analysis (assuming nh of 1.0 for each phase; figure
2a). schild regression analysis of the `high-anity' site yielded
an apparent pa2 value for rs-17053 of 9.2+0.3 (n=15). exposure of tissues to 100 mm cec for 20 min (which preferentially alkylates a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptors; han et al.,
1987; hieble et al., 1995a) did not signi®cantly in¯uence e/[a]
curves to na (figure 2b). however, figure 2b also shows that
following cec treatment, rs-17053 (30 nm) elicited surmountable parallel dextral shifts of e/[a] curves to na (pa2
estimate of 8.6; n=4). in tissues pretreated with rs 17053
(100 nm) to block a1a-adrenoceptors, bmy 7378 (10 ±
100 nm), a selective a1d-adrenoceptor antagonist (saussy et al.,
1994), failed to shift e/[a] curves to na, implicating no role
for a1d-adrenoceptors.
the a1a-adrenoceptor selective agonist, a-61603, elicited
robust increases in tension that did not fade over time (figure
3) and behaved as a full agonist relative to na. as can be seen
from figure 3, the absence of response `fade' in this assay
system was well re¯ected by the ability of a-61603 to surmount
fully the antagonism produced by tamsulosin, a slowly dissociating antagonist. more time was needed to reach steady-

state in the a-61603 e/[a] curve in tissues equilibrated with
tamsulosin (figure 3d) than was needed to achieve steady-state
in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx  (figure 3b) and rs-17053 (figure
3c). figure 4 shows that cumulative additions (0.5 log increments) of a-61603 resulted in monophasic e/[a] curves
(nh=1.05+0.06) with a p[a]50 of 7.59+0.04 (n=15) and that,
unlike the eect on responses to na (figure 2), rs-17053 (3 ±
300 nm) evoked surmountable parallel dextral shifts of e/[a]
curves to a-61603. further studies also revealed that e/[a]
curves to a-61603 constructed in the presence of ¯uparoxan
(1 mm), an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist with more than 2500
fold selectivity over a1-adrenoceptors (halliday et al., 1991)
were not signi®cantly dierent from those constructed in the
presence of 300 nm idazoxan (data not shown), providing
evidence that a2-adrenoceptors were not functionally involved
in responses to a-61603. additionally, incubation with cec
(100 mm for 20 min followed by washout) was without eect
on e/[a] curves to a-61603.
 xxxd3000xxx  (3 ± 300 nm, produced parallel dextral shifts of
e/[a] curves to a-61603 with no signi®cant reduction in
maxima. in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd3000xxx , the a2-adrenoceptor
antagonist ¯uparoxan (3 ± 30 mm) failed to shift e/[a] curves to
a-61603 any further (data not shown), illustrating that even
after e/[a] curve displacement, a2-adrenoceptor involvement
was not evident.

presence of 3 nm (*), 30 nm (&), and 300 nm (&) rs-17053. values
presented are expressed as a percentage of the maximal contraction
of the curve in the absence of rs-17053.

similarly, the high anity a1a-adrenoceptor antagonists,
rs-17053 (3 ± 300 nm), snap 5089 (10 ± 300 nm), 5-methylurapidil (10 ± 300 nm), tamsulosin (10 ± 300 nm), and rec 15/
2739 (10 ± 300 nm) all produced parallel dextral shifts of e/[a]
curves to a-61603 with no signi®cant change in maxima. as is
evident in table 1 and figure 5, schild regression slopes for
tamsulosin, hv 723, snap 5089, bmy 7378, and oxymetazoline were not signi®cantly dierent from 1, consistent with
simple competitive antagonism at a single receptor population.
in contrast, schild regression analysis for  xxxd3000xxx , rs 17053,
5-methylurapidil, and rec 15/2739 yielded lines with slopes
that were slightly, but signi®cantly, less than 1 (table 1 and
figure 5. however, in each case, it was possible to analyse a
component of the schild regression which was consistent with
a competitive interaction at a single population of a1-adrenoceptors (bold line in figure 5 with concentration-ratios of up

to approximately 20 to 30 fold). the estimates of antagonist
anity (pkb) and slopes for these partial regressions are also
given in table 1.
an agonist potency pro®le was obtained in order to extend
the characterization of the a1-adrenoceptor involved in contraction of rat caudal artery. table 2 shows that, with the
exception of a-61603 and phenylephrine, all agonists acted as
partial agonists relative to na. the following potency order
(relative potency) was observed: a-61603 (0.01)44na
(1)=phenylephrine (1)4sdz nvi 085 (2.3)=ns-49
(2.4)4amidephrine (6)= xxxd2601xxx  (6). e/[a] curves for
each agonist were displaced in a parallel manner, and with high
anity, by rs-17053 (30 nm).
oxymetazoline, although eliciting increases in tension, did
not act as an a1-adrenoceptor agonist, as rs-17053 (3 ±
300 nm) and  xxxd3000xxx  (3 ± 300 nm) failed to antagonize responses to oxymetazoline (data not shown). contractile responses to oxymetazoline were not antagonized by ¯uparoxan
(1 mm), but were antagonized by mesulergine (1 mm), and  xxxd2419xxx  (100 nm; data not shown), both of which behave as 5ht2 receptor antagonists (van wijngaarden et al., 1990). as
agonism of a1-adrenoceptors was not apparent with oxymetazoline, its ability to antagonize responses to a-61603 was
evaluated. oxymetazoline (100 ± 300 nm) produced parallel
concentration-dependent shifts in the e/[a] curves to a-61603
without aecting maxima, yielding a pkb estimate of 7.6 (table
1).

discussion
isolated helical strips from caudal artery of rat developed
tension in a robust and sustained manner in response to increasing concentrations of na. antagonism of na-mediated
responses by  xxxd3000xxx  was surmountable and fully consistent
with simple competition, as indicated by a schild regression
slope of 1. the subnanomolar anity estimate for  xxxd3000xxx 
con®rms the involvement of a1-adrenoceptors in mediating the
contraction to na.
in contrast to  xxxd3000xxx , rs-17053, which is a selective a1aadrenoceptor antagonist, displaced the e/[a] curves to na in a
biphasic manner, indicating contributions from more than one
adrenoceptor. however, after treatment with cec, rs-17053
evoked only parallel, high anity shifts. thus, it appears that
cec inactivated a low anity site for rs-17053. however, the

w.g. lachnit et al

a1a-adrenoceptor in caudal artery of rat

role of this putative site in the contractile response to na,
under normal conditions, may be minimal, as the treatment
with cec itself failed to alter e/[a] curves to na.
incubation of tissues with bmy 7378 (an antagonist selective for the a1d-adrenoceptor subtype; goetz et al., 1995) at
concentrations up to 100 nm, alone and in the presence of rs17053, did not in¯uence e/[a] curves to na (data not shown).
this indicates that the a1d-adrenoceptor subtype does not
contribute substantially to na-mediated contractions of the
rat caudal artery, despite the presence of messenger rna for
this receptor subtype (piascik et al., 1995). thus, rs-17053
resistant contractions may be mediated by the a1b-adrenoceptor subtype. further studies with a high anity competitive
antagonist possessing selectivity for the a1b-adrenoceptor will
be needed to test this notion.
in order to achieve selectivity of agonism, a-61603, a
novel imidazoline molecule was employed. a-61603 is selective for a1a-adrenoceptors and, despite its imidazoline structure, shows only weak agonist activity at a2-adrenoceptors,

(knepper et al., 1995). in caudal artery strips, a-61603 elicited stable increases in tension that did not fade and behaved as a full agonist relative to na. these sustained
increases in tension allowed for cumulative e/[a] curves to be
constructed, with a potency value displayed for a-61603 that
was only slightly lower than has been found previously (7.70,
canine prostate; 8.21, rat vas deferens; knepper et al., 1995).
this potency value, when compared with anity estimates at
cloned a1-adrenoceptor subtypes, is most consistent with activation of a1a-adrenoceptors (knepper et al., 1995). cumulative e/[a] curves to a-61603 surmounted fully the
antagonism of all agents tested, including those antagonists
(e.g. tamsulosin, dihydropyridines) which have been shown
previously to be insurmountable in other a1a-adrenoceptor
assays (see furukawa et al., 1995a,b). thus, because of the
stability of responses in caudal artery, it was possible to make
anity determinations for several anatagonists which might
otherwise have appeared `pseudoirreversible' (see kenakin,
1993).

table 3 shows that compounds with selectivity for the a1aadrenoceptor, most notably rs-17053, snap 5089, rec 15/
2739, and 5-methylurapidil, inhibited a-61603-mediated contractions of rat caudal artery with high anity (pkb estimates
of 8.9 ± 9.8), consistent with an action at the a1a-adrenoceptor
subtype (table 3). moreover, bmy 7378 exhibited low anity
consistent with that observed previously at a1a-adrenoceptors
(saussy et al., 1994). the high anities obtained with rs17053 and snap 5089 indicate clearly that these antagonists
can disclose a1a-adrenoceptors under conditions which prevail
in isolated tissue bath experiments.
agonist potencies in rat caudal artery are similar to those
obtained previously in the perfused isolated kidney of rat
(eltze & boer, 1992; blue et al., 1995). with the exception of
oxymetazoline, agonist e/[a] curves were displaced with high
anity by rs-17053 (data not shown). furthermore, the high
intrinsic activities obtained from experiments with amidephrine and a-61603 in particular, are strongly supportive of a1aadrenoceptor involvement (minneman et al., 1994; knepper et
al., 1995).
an interesting ®nding from the present study is that the
imidazoline, oxymetazoline, did not elicit increases in tension
via an agonist eect at an a1- or a2-adrenoceptor population,
but, apparently, via an eect on a  xxxg1113xxx  population
shown previously to function in this tissue (lachnit et al.,
1996). consequently, the ability of oxymetazoline to antagonise responses to a-61603 was evaluated. the estimate of
anity for oxymetazoline (pkb=7.6) is in accordance with a
pkb estimate of 7.9 obtained in the rat perfused isolated kidney

a1a-adrenoceptor in caudal artery of rat

(an a1a-adrenoceptor preparation; blue et al., 1995). these
data are also in agreement with pki values obtained from
radioligand binding assays for the a1a-, but not a1b- or a1dadrenoceptor subtypes (table 3; minneman & esbenshade,
1994).
it is intriguing that the a1-adrenoceptor subtype mediating the response to a-61603 in rat caudal artery displays a
pkb value of 9.1 for  xxxd3000xxx . such a value is slightly lower
than seen in rat kidney (9.5; blue et al., 1995) and vas deferens (9.3; burt et al., 1995) at the a1a-adrenoceptor but
still does not approach the low estimates obtained for the
a1l-adrenoceptor (e.g.; 7.9, dog saphenous vein; muramatsu
et al., 1990a; 8.3, human prostate; muramatsu et al., 1994)
which form a basis for the so-called a1l-adrenoceptor. although the putative a1l-adrenoceptor is also insensitive to
cec (muramatsu et al., 1990a), as is the major contractile
receptor found in the present study, the overriding pharmacological evidence fails to support its presence in rat
caudal artery. the high anities observed for rs-17053,
snap 5089 and 5-methylurapidil are solely consistent with
an a1a-adrenoceptor (see ford et al., 1996a). thus, a marginally lower anity estimate for  xxxd3000xxx  may indicate that
the a1a-adrenoceptor displays tissue-dependent variability in
anity, perhaps arising from cell-speci®c in¯uences on the
conformation of the receptor protein (see ford et al.,
1996b).
the data from the present study are not totally consistent
with a single receptor subtype mediating contractile responses to a-61603. a second site was revealed when e/[a]
curves to a-61603 were displaced by more than 20 to 30
fold. thus, schild regressions (slopes signi®cantly less than 1)
obtained against responses to a-61603 for  xxxd3000xxx , rs
17053, 5-methylurapidil, and rec 15/2739 may indicate receptor heterogeneity in rat caudal artery. however, it is of
interest that whereas slopes were slightly lower than 1 for
some antagonists (see above), others gave schild regressions
of 1 (tamsulosin, snap 5089, hv 723). if an additional
receptor population does contribute to contractile responses
of a-61603, it is a population with higher anity for these
latter antagonist. based on knowledge of this group of ligands, and currently de®ned a-adrenoceptors, it is dicult to
deduce any population that would display these characteristics.
it has been shown previously that the caudal artery of rat
contains functional a2-adrenoceptors (medgett & langer,
1984; atkinson et al., 1988). although these post-junctional a2adrenoceptors may play a prominent vasoconstrictor role in
vivo (redfern et al., 1995), when assayed in vitro, they contract
tissue only when basal tension is elevated by prior application
of another spasmogen (templeton et al., 1989; maclean &
mcgrath, 1990). furthermore, it has been shown recently that
the postjunctional a2-adrenoceptor functioning in rat caudal
artery is of the a2c subtype (craig et al., 1995). the binding
anities (pki) of a-61603 at the recombinant a2a-, a2b-, and
a2c-adrenoceptors are 6.0, 4.6 and 5.4, respectively, but ecacy
is very low at these subtypes (unpublished observations).
consequently, the involvement of a2-adrenoceptors is probably very minor, but may have been sucient to complicate the
shape of schild regressions in the current study, notably at e/
[a] curve shifts greater than 20 ± 30. clearly, the ®nding that
¯uparoxan (3 ± 30 mm) failed to shift further e/[a] curves to a61603 that were already shifted by  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mm) does not
support this explanation.
in summary, caudal artery of rat contracts in response to
na via activation of at least two a1-adrenoceptor subtypes.
one of these subtypes displays the pharmacology of the a1aadrenoceptor, while the other remains to be de®ned. a-61603
allows for isolation of the a1a-adrenoceptor component (approximate 30 fold window) and for quantitative pharmacological studies. in addition, data with rs-17053 and snap 5089
show that these selective a1a-adrenoceptor antagonists, despite
problematic physicochemical properties (i.e., high lipophilicity;
especially for snap 5089), are useful pharmacological probes

w.g. lachnit et al

that can be used at a low concentration in isolated tissue bath
studies to characterize receptor populations. in light of these
®ndings, the failure to observe high anities with these agents

a1a-adrenoceptor in caudal artery of rat

in human lower urinary tract tissues under identical experimental conditions (ford et al., 1996a) adds support to the a1ladrenoceptor characterization assigned to those tissues.
