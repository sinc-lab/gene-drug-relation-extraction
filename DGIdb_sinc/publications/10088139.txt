total sleep deprivation (tsd) shows powerful but transient
clinical effects in patients affected by bipolar depression.
 xxxd2957xxx  blocks the serotonergic 5-ht1a autoreceptor, thus
improving the antidepressant effect of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors. we evaluated the interaction of tsd
and  xxxd2957xxx  in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar
depression. forty bipolar depressed inpatients were
randomized to receive  xxxd2957xxx  7.5 mg/day or placebo for
nine days in combination with three consecutive tsd
cycles.  xxxd2957xxx  significantly improved the antidepressant
effect of tsd, and prevented the short-term relapse after

treatment. the response rate (hdrs scores ,8) at the end
of treatment was 15/20 for  xxxd2957xxx , and 3/20 for placebo.
coadministration of  xxxd2957xxx  and tsd resulted in a
complete response, which could be sustained for six months
with lithium salts alone, in 65% of cases. this results
suggest a major role for serotonergic transmission in the
mechanism of action of tsd, and makes tsd treatment
more effective in the treatment of bipolar depression.

though several hypotheses have been proposed, the
mechanism of action of tsd is still unclear. from a neurochemical point of view, sleep deprivation enhances
the functioning of several neurotransmitter systems including brain serotonin (5-ht) pathways, which physiologically show the highest activity during behavioral
arousal and the lowest during sleep (fornal and jacobs
1988). in particular, preclinical research showed that

total sleep deprivation (tsd) causes a marked but transient improvement of depressive symptomatology in
bipolar depressed patients: it acts rapidly and with a response rate of about 60%, but the dramatic mood improvement is usually followed by an early relapse (i.e.,
within the first days after tsd) which lessens the clinical usefulness of this treatment (wu and bunney 1990).

changes in the activity of brain 5-ht pathways after
sleep deprivation included an increase in the serotonergic neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn)
of cats (gardner et al. 1997), an increase in brain 5-ht
turnover in rats and hamsters (hery et al. 1970; cramer
et al. 1973; asikainen et al. 1995), and an increase in behavioral responsiveness to 5-ht precursors (santos and
carlini 1983). in agreement with these findings, a clinical study showed that in human depressed females
sleep deprivation led to an enhanced prolactine response to tryptophan, an effect mediated by serotonergic pathways (salomon et al. 1994).
preclinical studies showed that changes in 5-ht
function due to tsd involve a reduction in sensitivity
of 5-ht1a autoreceptors. in rats, maudhuit et al. (1996)
showed that rem sleep deprivation reduced the inhibitory response of serotonergic drn neurons to citalopram, an effect mediated by 5-ht1a autoreceptors stimulation (hjorth 1993). in cats, gardner et al. (1997)
showed that the neuronal inhibition produced by the
selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat) was reduced after tsd.
gardner et al. (1997) then hypothesized that the observed increase in the firing rate of serotonergic drn
neurons could be due to a decrease in the sensitivity of
5-ht1a autoreceptors after tsd.
several findings are in agreement with the hypothesis of gardner et al. (1997). in the awake cat the 5-ht1a
antagonist way-100635 increased 5-ht cell firing (fornal et al. 1996). in healthy human subjects the administration of the 5-ht1a-beta adrenoreceptor blocker  xxxd2957xxx , but not other beta adrenoreceptor blockers,
caused a significant rem sleep suppression with rem
rebound after withdrawal (betts and alford 1985; kostis and rosen 1987), an effect which is similar to that observed after administration of serotonergic antidepressant drugs (e.g., vogel et al. 1980). in rats,  xxxd2957xxx 
caused similar changes in sleep and antagonized the effects of 8-oh-dpat (monti and jantos 1994). in rats, the
5-ht1a antagonist nan-190 suppressed rem sleep and
the combination of nan-190 with citalopram augmented
the effect (neckelmann et al. 1996). since an enhancement in 5-ht function at the mesopontine level leads to
a reduction in rem sleep (leonard and llinàs 1994), these
findings suggest that manipulation of 5-ht1a autoreceptors directly influence brain serotonergic function.
in another hypothesis, enhancement in 5-ht firing
due to tsd could involve enhanced 5-ht1a autoreceptor stimulation, with self-inhibition of 5-ht neurons,
and subsequent reduction in the sensitivity of 5-ht1a
autoreceptors due to down-regulation mechanisms.
whether the “primary” effect of tsd on 5-ht pathways is the desentization of 5-ht1a autoreceptors or the
enhancement in neuronal firing, the administration of a
5-ht1a antagonist should potentiate the increase in 5-ht
function due to tsd.

sustained antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation 381

 xxxd2957xxx  is a 5-ht1a-beta adrenoreceptor blocking
drug. in vivo microdialysis and electrophysiological
studies showed that  xxxd2957xxx  blocks pre- but not
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors (romero et al. 1996).
since somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors are responsible of the self-inhibition of 5-ht on serotonergic neurons, it has been hypothesized that the combination of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) with  xxxd2957xxx  could reduce the self-inhibition of serotonergic
transmission, thus enhancing the antidepressant effect
of the former compounds (artigas 1995; artigas et al.
1996). recent double-blind placebo-controlled studies
confirmed, with one exception (berman et al. 1997), that
 xxxd2957xxx  hastens the antidepressant effect of ssris
(perez et al. 1997; tome et al. 1997a, 1997b; zanardi et
al. 1997; zanardi et al. 1998), while controversial results
have been reported in studies on resistant depression
(e.g., artigas et al. 1994; blier and bergeron 1995;
moreno et al. 1997).
preclinical and clinical evidences suggest that an enhancement in 5-ht function may be a common denominator in the therapeutic action of most antidepressant
treatments (blier et al. 1990; charney et al. 1984). if tsd
exerts its effect through an increase in brain 5-ht activity, the coadministration of  xxxd2957xxx  should result in an
enhanced antidepressant effect, similar to that observed
with  xxxd2957xxx  and serotonergic drugs.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
effect of the combination of tsd and  xxxd2957xxx  in the
treatment of acute episodes of bipolar depression.

methods
patients
eighty-six consecutively admitted inpatients diagnosed
as bipolar disorder, type i, depressive episode without
psychotic features (dsm-iv criteria) (american psychiatric association 1994) were screened. all patients were
submitted to physical examinations, laboratory tests
and electrocardiograms at admission in order to exclude pregnancy, history of epilepsy, major medical
and neurological disorders, medical contraindications
to the use of  xxxd2957xxx , history of drug or alcohol dependency or abuse within the last six months. forty-six out
of 86 patients were excluded: 9 because of additional diagnoses on axis i, 1 because of mental retardation, 29
because of treatment with lithium salts or long-acting
neuroleptic drugs in the last six months before admission or with neuroleptics or irreversible maois in the
last month before admission, 1 because of history of epilepsy, and 7 because of medical illnesses.
forty patients met the selection criteria and gave
their written informed consent to participate in the
study. previous treatments during the current episode were: ssris 8/40, tricyclic antidepressants 10/40,

382 e. smeraldi et al.

moclobemide 1/40, benzodiazepines 7/40, no medication 14/40.

neuropsychopharmacology 1999–vol. 20, no. 4

during the follow-up period, they were excluded from
the study and administered a drug treatment upon clinical need.

study design
patients underwent a 7-day run-in period with singleblind placebo, during which semi-structured interviews
based on dsm-iv for axis i diagnoses were completed.
after the run-in period, all patients had a 21-item
hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs) (hamilton
1960) score .18 and no response to placebo was observed.
patients were randomly assigned to two treatment
groups (day 0): tsd plus  xxxd2957xxx  (group 1, n 5 20) or
tsd plus placebo (group 2, n 5 20); randomization was
performed by a computer generated schedule. all subjects were administered three tsd cycles, composed of
a night of tsd followed by a recovery night. on days 1,
3, and 5 patients were totally deprived of sleep and had
to stay awake for 36 hours, from 7:00 a.m. until 7:00
p.m. of the following day. they were then allowed to
sleep during the night of days 2, 4, and 6 (benedetti et
al. 1996). from day 1 to day 9 patients were doubleblind treated tid with  xxxd2957xxx  2.5 mg or placebo.
patients’ perceived mood levels were rated by a selfadministered 12.5 cm visual analogue scale (vas)
[modified from aitken (1969)] three times during the
day (7 a.m., 1 p.m., and 7 p.m.) from day 1 to day 7. patients could not see their previous self-ratings when administered vas. raw data were converted to a 0–100
rating scale, with 0, 50, and 100 denoting depression,
normothymia, and euphoria, respectively. the patient’s
perceived mood level on each day was calculated as the
mean of the three scores for that day.
the 21-item hdrs was administered by trained raters who were blind to treatment option at day 0 and at
day 10 (i.e., four days after the last tsd cycle); whenever possible, the same rater conducted admission and
following ratings for each patient. severity of depression was rated over a one-day period except for item #16
(weight loss) which was rated over a period of one week.
side effects were recorded using dosage records
and treatment emergent symptoms (dotes) (nimh
1976); blood pressure and pulse frequency were recorded three times a day by nursing staff.
if patients showed a complete response to treatment
(defined as hdrs score ,8 at day 10) and maintained it
for the following week without medication, they started
a mood stabilizing therapy with lithium carbonate (day
17) and their clinical status was monitored during the
following six months (once a week during the first two
months, and once a month during the following four).
lithium salts were up-titrated to reach therapeutic levels. mean 6 sd plasma lithium levels were .69 6 .07 after 1 month, .71 6 .06 after three months, and .67 6 .07
after six months. if patients did not respond or relapsed

data analysis
baseline clinical and demographic characteristics between groups were compared using x2 test (with yates’
correction) and student’s t tests as appropriate. changes
in hdrs scores over time between groups were analyzed with a two-way repeated measures analysis of covariance, with time and treatment ( xxxd2957xxx  or placebo)
as independent variables, and age, number of previous
episodes, and duration of current episode as covariates.
post hoc comparisons were performed with scheffé test.
homogeneity of variances at time 0 was tested using
levene’s test. vas scores were compared with student’s t tests for independent samples. between group
differences in response rates at day 10 and in relapse
rates during the follow up period were tested with x2
test (with yates’ correction). computerized analyses
were performed with a commercially available statistical package (statistica 1993).

results
clinical and demographic characteristics of two groups
(group 1 vs. group 2) were as follows. sex distribution:
8 males, 12 females vs. 7 males, 13 females; current age
(mean 6 sd): 44.90 6 11.47 vs. 51.60 6 11.97 years; age
of onset: 30.90 6 7.17 vs. 34.15 6 11.66 years; duration
of illness: 14.00 6 10.60 vs. 17.45 6 9.28 years; number of
episodes: 5.70 6 3.39 vs. 8.35 6 5.14; duration of current
episode: 8.50 6 11.55 vs. 13.40 6 10.84 weeks. no difference between the two groups was statistically significant.
mean 6 sd hdrs scores at day 0 were 24.65 6 3.30
in group 1 and 25.70 6 5.28 in group 2. mean 6 sd
hdrs scores at day 10 were 6.60 6 5.55 (26.8% of baseline values) in group 1 and 16.55 6 6.68 (64.4% of baseline values) in group 2. homogeneity of variances at
time 0 was successfully tested (f 5 1.39; df 1,38; p 5
0.25). a two-way repeated measures analysis of covariance on hdrs scores showed a highly significant group
effect (f 5 13.59; df 1,35; p 5 .0008), a highly significant
time effect (f 5 159.89; df 1,35; p 5 .00001), and a highly
significant time per group interaction (f 5 17.12; df 1,35;
p 5 .0002). covariates did not significantly influence
hdrs scores. scheffé test showed a non significant difference between groups at baseline (p 5 0.914) and significantly better scores for group 1 at day 10 (p ,
.00001).
mean vas scores are plotted in figure 1. a comparison
between the two groups showed significant differences
after the second tsd (day 4: student’s t 5 2.92, df 5 38,

two-tailed p 5 .006) and after the last recovery night
(day 7: t 5 2.17, df 5 38, p 5 .036).
at day 10, 15/20 group 1 patients were rated as responders (hdrs score ,8) versus 3/20 group 2 patients (x2 5 12.22, df 1, p 5 .0005) (figure 2). one week
after, 14/20 group 1 and 1/20 group 2 patients were
still rated as responders (x2 5 15.36, df 1, p 5 .0001)
and started a mood stabilizing therapy with lithium
salts.
no switch into manic phase was observed.
during the follow-up period, one group 1 responder
relapsed (4 weeks after the acute treatment).
no patient showed clinically relevant side effects
during  xxxd2957xxx  treatment, nor there was any drop out
among the 40 patients enrolled into the study. six patients joined to group 1 ( xxxd2957xxx ) complained hypotension; 4 patients (equally distributed into the two
treatment groups) referred headache and 10 patients (8
assigned to  xxxd2957xxx  group and 2 to placebo group)
complained about a “scarcely restorative sleep” during
the recovery nights, without insomnia. a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance showed that  xxxd2957xxx  significantly reduced systolic (day 0 131.0 6 21.7
mmhg; day 4 121.8 6 26.1; day 9 120.3 6 23.6) and diastolic blood pressure (day 0 83.8 6 12.1; day 4 77.3 6
13.0; day 9 76.0 6 11.4) and pulse frequency (day 0 76.3 6
7.7 bpm; day 4 73.2 6 8.3; day 9 73.2 6 7.7).

tients treated with coadministration of  xxxd2957xxx  and
tsd (versus 15% of patients treated with placebo and
tsd) showed a complete response. one week after 70%
and 5% of patients respectively were still rated as responders.
these data confirming the presence of a positive interaction between  xxxd2957xxx  and tsd are in agreement
with the hypothesis of a major role of 5-ht neurotransmission in the mechanism of action of tsd. despite the
clinical relevance of the effect, detailed psychobiologic
explanations must be considered only hypothetical because of the still uncertain status of research about the
neurochemical effects of tsd. basing on the data on 5-ht
function summarized in the introduction,  xxxd2957xxx  could
act sinergistically with tsd via two different but not alternative mechanisms:  xxxd2957xxx  could directly enhance
5-ht turnover by blocking somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors; or  xxxd2957xxx  could prevent the self-inhibiting activation of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors
due to increased 5-ht turnover in brain stem.
since  xxxd2957xxx  is also a beta-blocker, the possibility
of a noradrenergic mechanism in explaining our findings cannot be excluded. up to now no data are available on the interaction between beta-blocking drugs devoid of 5-ht1a antagonism and tsd. when given
alone, however, beta-blocking drugs do not show antidepressant properties and can induce depressive symptomatology (e.g., waal 1967; petrie et al. 1982). further
researches employing more specific drugs will clarify
this point.
only one group 1 responder relapsed during the sixmonth follow-up period. for ethical reasons, all responders were treated with lithium salts, and this is
likely to have contributed to a sustained response. lith-

at the end of the acute treatment (day 10; i.e., four days
after the last tsd cycle) 75% of bipolar depressed pa-

384 e. smeraldi et al.

ium salts have been reported to have acute antidepressant properties in bipolar depression, possibly via a serotonergic mechanism (e.g., price and heninger 1994),
and to acutely sustain the effect of sleep deprivation
(e.g., szuba et al. 1994). however, since lithium was administered only 11 days after the last tsd cycle, it could
not interfere with the acute effect of tsd treatment.
a high rate of switch from depression into mania after tsd has been reported in rapid-cycling bipolar depressed patients (wehr et al. 1982; wehr 1992). few
data are available on the occurrence of switch after tsd
in other diagnostic cathegories (see review in wu and
bunney 1990). in the present study we did not observe
switches into mania. the possibility of a switch from
depression into mania should, however, be considered
when treating bipolar depressed patients with antidepressant treatments (e.g., solomon et al. 1990).
this is the first report about the effect of the combination of  xxxd2957xxx  to tsd. american psychiatric association practice guidelines suggest the usefulness of sleep
deprivation in the treatment of bipolar depression
(american psychiatric association, 1995), but the high
frequency of an early relapse after tsd and the difficulty to carry out the treatment have hampered a broad
application of this technique. whichever the exact
mechanism of action, the combination of  xxxd2957xxx  to
tsd seems to resolve the relapse problem. given the
high response rates in the absence of important side effects, the rapidity of action in responders, and the short
time needed to test its efficacy, the use of  xxxd2957xxx  in
combination with sleep deprivation may represent a
tentative first choice therapy in the treatment of bipolar
depression.
