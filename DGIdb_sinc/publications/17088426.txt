here is a growing appreciation that the cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp)– xxxg1836xxx 
(pka) signaling pathway is organized to form transduction units that function to deliver speciﬁc messages.
such organization results in the local activation of pka
subsets through the generation of conﬁned intracellular
gradients of camp, but the mechanisms responsible for
limiting the diffusion of camp largely remain to be clariﬁed. in this study, by performing real-time imaging of
camp, we show that prostaglandin 1 stimulation generates multiple contiguous, intracellular domains with different camp concentration in human embryonic kidney 293

cells. by using pharmacological and genetic manipulation
of phosphodiesterases (pdes), we demonstrate that compartmentalized  xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  are responsible for
selectively modulating the concentration of camp in individual subcellular compartments. we propose a model
whereby compartmentalized pdes, rather than representing an enzymatic barrier to camp diffusion, act as a sink
to drain the second messenger from discrete locations,
resulting in multiple and simultaneous domains with different camp concentrations irrespective of their distance
from the site of camp synthesis.

introduction
camp is a ubiquitous second messenger and is responsible for a
plethora of cellular effects and biological functions (beavo and
brunton, 2002). the generation of camp occurs upon ligand
binding to gs protein–coupled receptors (gpcrs) and the consequent activation of a family of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases
(acs) localized at the plasma membrane (cooper, 2005). an alternative source of camp is the soluble ac, an enzyme that has
been shown to localize in different subcellular compartments,
the activity of which is independent of gpcr stimulation and is
regulated by bicarbonate and calcium ions (zippin et al., 2003).
camp exerts its cellular functions via the activation of
three different effectors: the camp-dependent pka, cyclic

nucleotide-gated ion channels (biel et al., 1999), and exchange
proteins directly activated by camp (epac; bos, 2003). the action of camp is terminated via its degradation by phosphodiesterases (pdes), a large superfamily of enzymes grouped in 11
families with >40 isoenzyme variants (soderling and beavo,
2000; francis et al., 2001; houslay and adams, 2003; lugnier,
2006). individual pde enzymes exert specific functional roles
as a consequence of the unique combination of regulatory mechanisms, intracellular localization, and enzyme kinetics (houslay
and milligan, 1997; beavo and brunton, 2002; baillie et al.,
2005) and play an important role in shaping intracellular gradients of camp (rich et al., 2001; zaccolo and pozzan, 2002;
rochais et al., 2004).
the notion of the spatial regulation of camp as a means
of generating specific downstream responses is now well accepted (tasken and aandahl, 2004; wong and scott, 2004).
such a paradigm is grounded on increasing evidence that
camp/pka signaling is compartmentalized in discrete subcellular domains in which pka is anchored to a kinase–anchoring

generation of a fret-based sensor
for camp targeted to the plasma membrane

we recently generated a fret-based sensor for real-time imaging of camp. the sensor, called pka-gfp, includes the regulatory (r) and catalytic (c) subunits of the pka tagged with the
cfp and yfp variants of gfp, respectively (fig. 1 a). when
overexpressed in hek293 cells, pka-gfp shows a uniform
distribution in the cytosol (fig. 1 a).

to compare camp dynamics in the bulk cytosol and in
the subplasma membrane compartment, we generated a variant
of the pka-gfp sensor that is targeted to the plasma membrane. to this end, we fused to the n terminus of the r subunit a
short polypeptide (mp) corresponding to the n-terminal targeting signal from the lyn kinase (resh, 1999). this sequence is
posttranslationally myristoylated and palmitoylated and targets
to the plasma membrane (fig. 1 b). hek293 cells cotransfected
with mpr-cfp and c-yfp (mppka-gfp) show the predicted
localization of both the r and c subunits at the plasma membrane
(fig. 1 b). to verify that modification of the r-cfp sequence
with the mp peptide does not affect the sensitivity for camp,
we determined activation constant (ka) values both for pka-gfp
and mppka-gfp. as shown in fig. 1 c, ka values were identical for the two sensors (ka = 0.77 mum). modification at the
n terminus of the r subunit does not affect its dynamic interactions with the c subunit, as shown by its complete release

proteins (akaps; wong and scott, 2004) in close proximity to
its specific targets and is activated by restricted pools of camp
(buxton and brunton, 1983; jurevicius and fischmeister, 1996;
zaccolo and pozzan, 2002; mongillo et al., 2004; barnes et al.,
2005; dodge-kafka et al., 2005). however, the concept of the
restricted intracellular diffusion of camp contrasts with the evidence that the diffusion rate of this second messenger in the
cytosol appears to be unrestrained (500–700 mum2s−1; bacskai
et al., 1993; nikolaev et al., 2004). to explain the paradox of a
signaling pathway organized in spatially segregated transduction units, the selective activation of which is committed to a
freely diffusible second messenger, the hypothesis of either a
physical or an enzymatic barrier restricting intracellular diffusion of camp has been formulated (rich et al., 2000, 2001;
zaccolo et al., 2002; cooper, 2003; rochais et al., 2004;
willoughby et al., 2006; for review see brunton, 2003).
recently, new methods for monitoring intracellular camp
concentration in single living cells have been developed. one approach using cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel–based sensors
relies on ion influx measurements as a readout of camp changes
near the plasma membrane (rich et al., 2001). another approach
uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret)–based indicators in which camp binding to pka (zaccolo et al., 2000) or
epac (dipilato et al., 2004; nikolaev et al., 2004; ponsioen et al.,
2004) proteins leads to a change in fluorescence emission that
correlates with the intracellular concentration of camp. such optical biosensors allow the detection of camp changes with submicrometer resolution in different intracellular compartments.
these new technologies led to the identification in human
embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells of a subplasma membrane
compartment showing a larger rise in camp concentration in
response to prostaglandin 1 ( xxxd124xxx ) receptor stimulation as
compared with the bulk cytosol (rich et al., 2001; dipilato et al.,
2004), but the molecular and structural components responsible
for such compartmentalization largely remain to be defined.
here, we set out to study local camp dynamics by using
fret-based biosensors that are selectively targeted to distinct
subcellular compartments in hek293 cells. we found that compartmentalized pdes, rather than acting as barriers to camp
diffusion from the plasma membrane to the bulk cytosol, act as
a sink that drains camp concentration in defined domains by
locally degrading the second messenger. as a result, intracellular camp concentration is not bound to change along a uniform
gradient from the plasma membrane to the deep cytosol, but
multiple contiguous domains with different concentrations of
camp may coexist within the volume of the cell.

 xxxd124xxx  stimulation generates a higher camp
response under the plasma membrane
as compared with the bulk cytosol

to verify whether gpcr stimulation generates different camp
signals in the subplasma membrane compartment as compared
with the bulk cytosol, we stimulated hek293 cells transfected
with either pka-gfp or mppka-gfp with 10 mum  xxxd124xxx  and
measured camp-induced fret changes in the two compartments. as shown in fig. 2 (a–c), the camp response in the
subplasma membrane compartment was almost twice as large
as the response in the bulk cytosol (∆r/r0 = 18.6 ± 2.1 [mean
± sem; n = 30] vs. 9.6 ± 1.2% [n = 34]; p = 1.4 × 10−4).
furthermore, the time to reach half-maximal response to  xxxd124xxx 
was almost twice as fast in the subplasma membrane compartment as compared with the bulk cytosol (t1/2 = 58.9 ± 7.3 [n =
30] and 110.6 ± 12.5 s [n = 34], respectively; p = 1.7 × 10−3;
fig. 2 d). we found that in 50% of the analyzed cells,  xxxd124xxx 
generated a transient response in both the subplasma membrane
compartment and the bulk cytosol, with the level of camp returning to baseline levels in 5.8 ± 0.84 and 7.6 ± 1.04 min, respectively, after application of the stimulus (fig. 2 b). in the
other 50% of the cells, the response reached a plateau value
and remained sustained for at least 10 min (unpublished data).
application of the nonselective pde inhibitor isobutyl-methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ; 100 mum) in the continuous presence of  xxxd124xxx 
raised the camp level in both compartments, indicating that

c-yfp is effectively resequestered to the plasma membrane upon
camp removal (supplemental material and video 1; available at
http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200605050/dc1).

termination of the camp response to  xxxd124xxx  was caused by pde
activity. we excluded any overt role for receptor desensitization
in the termination of the camp response to  xxxd124xxx  based on the
observation that it is possible to repeatedly stimulate the  xxxd124xxx 
receptor and obtain comparable rises in intracellular [camp]
(supplemental material and fig. s1; available at http://www.jcb.
org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200605050/dc1). the application of
1 mum  xxxd124xxx  also generated different camp levels in the two
compartments, with a response in the subplasma membrane compartment of 8.2 ± 1.5% (n = 34) and of 3.3 ± 0.6% (n = 33) in
the bulk cytosol (p = 9.5 × 10−4; fig. 2 e).
a unimolecular sensor for camp conﬁrms
the generation of discrete camp domains
upon  xxxd124xxx  stimulation

when using the mppka-gfp sensor, the binding of camp to
mpr-cfp causes subunit dissociation, releasing the c-yfp
subunits to diffuse away from the mprii-cfp fret partners
anchored at the plasma membrane. conversely, when camp
binds to the r-cfp subunits of pka-gfp in the bulk cytosol,
the dissociating c-yfp subunits remain in close proximity to
their cytosolic r-cfp fret partners. in our experiments,
fret changes are measured as cfp intensity/yfp intensity
(480/545-nm fluorescence emission; see fret imaging section).
therefore, as a result of the diffusion of c-yfp away from
the plasma membrane, the fret changes measured upon probe
dissociation in the subplasma membrane compartment may
result in artifactually larger values being observed than the
fret changes measured in the cytosol. to exclude this possibility and confirm that the subplasma membrane compartment
and the cytosolic compartments show a distinct camp response

to  xxxd124xxx , we used a unimolecular fret sensor for camp based
on epac1 (h30; fig. 3 a). as h30 is a single polypeptide chain,
cfp and yfp do not diffuse apart upon camp binding. we
modified h30 by fusing the plasma membrane–targeting mp sequence (mph30; fig. 3 b) to its n terminus, which, as with rii,
allowed for the effective targeting of this unimolecular sensor to
the plasma membrane (fig. 3 b). membrane targeting of h30
did not substantially modify its sensitivity to camp, as shown
by the apparent dissociation constants measured for h30 and
mph30 (ec50 = 12.5 and 20 mum, respectively; fig. 3 c). using
these unimolecular probes, we show in fig. 3 (d and e) that the
stimulation of hek293 cells expressing h30 or mph30 with
1 mum  xxxd124xxx  generated a mean ∆r/r0 of 23.5 ± 1.4 (n = 40) and
31.4 ± 1.2% (n = 36), respectively (p = 10−4). these results
confirm that  xxxd124xxx  stimulation generates a compartmentalized
camp response, with a higher level of camp being generated
in the subplasma membrane compartment as compared with the
bulk cytosol. interestingly, the steepness of the camp gradient
between the subplasma membrane and bulk cytosol compartments is smaller (35% higher camp response at the plasma
membrane vs. the cytosol) as compared with the steepness of
the gradient recorded with the pka-based sensor (148% higher
camp response at the plasma membrane vs. the cytosol; compare fig. 2 e with fig. 3 e).

cytosol upon  xxxd124xxx  stimulation. however, such a gradient appears
steeper when detected by the pka-gfp probe as compared
with h30. one possible explanation for this is that overexpression of the pka-based sensor, the catalytic subunit of which
is enzymatically active, may affect the steepness of the camp
gradient. to test this hypothesis, we measured camp levels in
hek293 cells transfected with either h30 or mph30 alone or
in combination with untagged pka. as shown in fig. 4 (a and b),
in the presence of overexpressed pka, the fret change
recorded at the plasma membrane was ∆r/r0 = 9.5 ± 1%
(n = 48), whereas the fret change recorded in the bulk cytosol
was ∆r/r0 = 5.8 ± 0.5% (n = 60; p = 0.0009), indicating
that the level of camp is 62% higher at the plasma membrane as compared with the cytosol. thus, pka overexpression increases the steepness of the camp gradient between the
two compartments around twofold. in further support of this,
we found that the higher the level of pka overexpression,
the larger the effect is on the steepness of the camp gradient
(supplemental material and fig. s2; available at http://www.jcb.
org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200605050/dc1).
pka is known to activate  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 families of
pdes, thereby stimulating the degradation of camp (smith
et al., 1996; mackenzie et al., 2002). interestingly, pde4 and
 xxxg1695xxx  are the major camp pde activities represented in
hek293 cells, with pde4 accounting for 68% of the total
pde activity and  xxxg1695xxx  accounting for a remaining 30% (lynch
et al., 2005). therefore, we asked whether pdes may be the
effectors of pka in modulating the steepness of the camp
gradient. we found that the inhibition of pdes with 100 mum of
the nonselective pde inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx  completely abolished the

reestablishing a difference in the camp level present in the two
compartments of 25% (compare fig. 4 b with fig. 3 e). these
results confirm that pdes mediate the effect of pka on the
camp gradient. in agreement with this finding and in support of
the key role played by pka in shaping the camp gradient, the
inhibition of overexpressed pka activity with 10 mum  xxxd477xxx 
completely abolished the camp gradient (∆r/r0 = 12.7 ±
2.05% [n =35] in the cytosol and 16.18 + 2.7% [n =22] at the
plasma membrane; p = ns; fig. 4 b). similarly, the inhibition
of endogenous pka with  xxxd477xxx  was sufficient to completely dissipate the camp gradient generated upon  xxxd124xxx  stimulation
(fig. 4 c). interestingly, the camp response to  xxxd124xxx  in the
presence of  xxxd477xxx  was invariably more sustained in time, with the
level of camp being reduced by only 25%  xxxd1891xxx  min after application of the stimulus.
to determine the contribution of different pde families in
shaping the camp gradient, we selectively inhibited either
pde4 with 10 mum  xxxd3142xxx  (mackenzie and houslay, 2000) or
 xxxg1695xxx  with 10 mum cilostamide (manganiello and degerman,

the effect of total pde inhibition with  xxxd2388xxx  (∆r/r0 = 30.88 ±
3.9% [n = 14] in the cytosol and 41.8 ± 2% [n = 16] at the

 xxxd3142xxx  showed a similar effect in cells transfected with h30

data). conversely, selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition with 10 mum cilostamide did not substantially raise the camp level generated by
 xxxd124xxx  stimulation in either compartments both in the presence
(∆r/r0 = 5.05 ± 0.6% [n = 16] in the cytosol and 10.8 ± 1.7%
[n = 12] at the plasma membrane; p = 0.00095; fig. 5) and in
the absence of overexpressed pka (not depicted). these results
strongly indicate that pde4 is the key regulator of the intracellular camp gradient in hek293 cells.
tethered pdes determine the direction
of the camp gradient in hek293 cells
upon  xxxd124xxx  stimulation

our results are in agreement with studies indicating that pdes
may be responsible for the generation of intracellular camp
gradients by acting as an enzymatic barrier that by rapidly degrading camp limits its diffusion from the site of synthesis
(the plasma membrane) to the deep cytosol (rich et al., 2000;
rochais et al., 2004; mongillo et al., 2004). according to this
view, the inhibition of pde activity would abolish the barrier to
camp diffusion and should result in a fast reequilibration of camp
concentration within the cell. surprisingly, however, our results
show that pde inhibition with either  xxxd2388xxx  or  xxxd3142xxx  does
not dissipate the camp gradient between the plasma membrane
and the bulk cytosol elicited by  xxxd124xxx  stimulation (figs. 2, b–e;
3 e, 4, and 5). we reasoned that as both  xxxd2388xxx  and  xxxd3142xxx 
are competitive pde inhibitors, in the high [camp] subplasma
membrane compartment, they may be less efficient in inhibiting
pdes than in the bulk cytosol (lower [camp]), thus sustaining
the camp gradient between the two compartments.
to test the effect of noncompetitive inhibition of pde4
on the intracellular camp gradient, we performed genetic ablation of pdes by an rna silencing approach to reduce enzyme
concentration. the most represented pde4 subfamilies in
hek293 cells are  xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx , with  xxxg1698xxx  representing 30% of the total pde4 activity and  xxxg1700xxx  representing
65% in these cells (lynch et al., 2005). therefore, we focused
on these two subfamilies. the design of sirna oligonucleotides

as well as the time and means of transfection had been previously optimized by us to achieve 95% selective knockdown

we cotransfected the camp sensor with sirna sequences that
selectively knock down  xxxg1700xxx , we found that the camp response was higher in the cytosol as compared with the
subplasma membrane compartment (∆r/r0 = 22.8 ± 2.4 [n =
25] and 14.6 ± 2.5% [n = 23], respectively; p = 0.04; fig. 6 c).
the finding that the ablation of  xxxg1700xxx  results in the inversion of the camp gradient suggests that a pde different from
 xxxg1700xxx  is active in the subplasma membrane compartment and
maintains the camp concentration low in that domain. in fact,
when we ablated both  xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx , we found that the
camp gradient was completely abolished (∆r/r0 = 22.8 ±
2.2% [n = 20] in the cytosol and 20.3 ± 2.4% [n = 22] in
the subplasma membrane compartment; fig. 6 d). overall, our
results suggest that  xxxg1698xxx  mainly regulates the subplasma
membrane compartment, whereas  xxxg1700xxx  mainly regulates the
cytosolic pool.
the ability of individual pde4 subfamilies to control
camp concentration independently in defined compartments
implies that they are selectively tethered within such compartments. to test this, we overexpressed catalytically inactive point
mutants of  xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  in hek293 cells. such mutants
have been shown to exert a dominant-negative (dn) effect by
displacing the cognate endogenous active pde4 isoforms from
their functionally relevant anchor sites (baillie et al., 2003). as
shown in fig. 7 a, upon the overexpression of either dnpde4b1
or dnpde4b2, the camp response to  xxxd124xxx  was higher in the
subplasma membrane compartment than in the cytosol. this
finding indicates that the displacement of  xxxg1698xxx  from its anchor
sites and its consequent distribution inside the cell do not affect

 xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  localize in distinct
compartments in hek293 cells

the aforementioned effect of the genetic manipulation of
 xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  implies a distinct localization of the two
enzyme subfamilies. to confirm this, we performed immunocytochemistry by using monoclonal antibodies specific for either
subfamilies and found that, as expected,  xxxg1698xxx  shows a prevalent localization at the plasma membrane, whereas  xxxg1700xxx  localizes mainly in the bulk cytosol (fig. 8). such membrane
sequestration of  xxxg1698xxx  is consistent with a previous study
showing that in hek293 cells, pde4b2 is unavailable to interact with cytosolic beta-arrestin (lynch et al., 2005).
pde4s deﬁne local drains for camp
and generate multiple contiguous,
intracellular compartments with different
concentrations of the second messenger

the results presented in figs. 6 and 7 indicate that pde4
enzymes, rather than acting as a barrier to camp diffusion
from the site of synthesis to the bulk cytosol, function as a local drain to degrade freely diffusible camp and maintain the
low concentration of the second messenger in discrete compartments. thus, rather than a continuous gradient from the
plasma membrane (higher [camp]) to the deep cytosol (lower
[camp]), we may expect to find contiguous compartments with
higher or lower [camp] independent of their distance from the
site of synthesis but depending on the localization and activity
of pdes. according to this hypothesis, a subcellular compartment deeper inside the cell as compared with the bulk cytosol and in which pde activity is low should show a higher
[camp] as compared with the bulk cytosol. the nucleus is such
a compartment.
to monitor [camp] inside the nucleus, we fused a nuclear
localization sequence (nls) to the c terminus of the h30 sensor
(fig. 9 a) that selectively targets the probe to the nucleus (fig.
9 a). when we challenged hek293 cells transfected with nlsh30
with 1 mum  xxxd124xxx , we found that the fret change was higher in

0.03) and was similar to the fret change found in the subplasma membrane compartment (fig. 9, b and c). the different
response recorded in the nucleus was not caused by a higher
sensitivity of the nlsh30 sensor to camp changes, as indicated
by similar ec50 (17.5 mum for nlsh30 vs. 12.5 mum for h30; fig.
3 c). in apparent contrast with our data showing that there is
a delay in the camp changes in the bulk cytosol as compared
with the subplasma membrane compartment (fig. 2 d), the kinetics of the nuclear camp changes appear to be as fast as those
occurring at the plasma membrane (fig. 9 b). this is caused
by differences in probe kinetics in that the velocity of nlsh30
fret change upon [camp] rise is significantly faster than
the velocity of h30 (p = 0.004) and mph30 (p = 0.0001)
fret changes at the same [camp] (supplemental material).
the difference in the fret change between the nucleus and the
bulk cytosol was completely abolished when  xxxg1700xxx  was ablated by sirna duplex cotransfection (∆r/r0 = 17.7 ± 1.5%

the pleiotropic effects of camp pose the pressing question of
how signaling specificity is achieved. in the past few years,
compartmentalization of the camp signal transduction pathway has emerged as an important mechanism to ensure the necessary specificity of response (tasken and aandahl, 2004; wong
and scott, 2004). a particular focus has been placed on the organization of macromolecular complexes, including receptors,
effectors, modulators, and targets effectively organized in restricted domains, within which the molecular components of
the complex only affect each other appropriately. some of these
domains are localized at the plasma membrane, one example of
which is the assembly of the beta2 adrenergic receptor, heterotrimeric g proteins, ac, and pka and its target, the l-type ca2+
channel  xxxg304xxx  (davare et al., 2001). within the complex, activation of the receptor leads to the synthesis of camp and activation of pka, which, in turn, can regulate the activity of the
channel in a highly localized manner. akap/pka signaling domains have also been found to be located deep in the cytosol
and away from the site of camp synthesis, as is the case, for
example, for the centrosome-associated akaps (witczak et al.,
1999) or the nuclear membrane-associated muscle akap
(dodge et al., 2001). specific activation of the pka pools,
which are spatially segregated deep inside the cell, requires that
camp is made available selectively in such compartments. how
the highly hydrophilic, freely diffusible camp molecule can
selectively activate deep intracellular targets without affecting
pka enzymes located closer to the site of camp synthesis
remains to be defined.
one example of the limited diffusion of camp is the generation of a subplasma membrane pool of the second messenger
in response to  xxxd124xxx  stimulation of hek293 cells. to explain
such compartmentalization, the hypothesis was formulated of a
physical barrier that is possibly formed by elements of the endoplasmic reticulum and localizes underneath the plasma membrane, thereby limiting camp diffusion from the site of synthesis
to the deep cytosol (rich et al., 2000). however, an important
contribution to camp compartmentalization appears to derive
from the activity of pdes, as pointed out by a large body of indirect evidence based on altered cell functioning after selective
pde inhibition (rich et al., 2001; zaccolo and pozzan, 2002;
jurevicius et al., 2003; abrahamsen et al., 2004; mongillo et al.,
2004, 2006). pdes can be targeted to subcellular compartments,
including the plasma membrane, and can be recruited into multiprotein signaling complexes (perry et al., 2002), thereby providing a means to terminate the camp signal in a spatially
restricted manner (baillie et al., 2005). such features suggested
a role for pdes as an enzymatic barrier to camp diffusion
(for review see brunton, 2003; barnes et al., 2005; willoughby
et al., 2006).

the model of a barrier to camp diffusion implies the generation of a gradient of camp with a higher concentration of the
second messenger at the plasma membrane and a progressively
lower concentration toward the deep cytosol. however, the direction of such a gradient is incompatible with the selective activation of a subset of pka anchored deep inside the cytosol
without concomitant activation of those pka enzymes that are
localized at the plasma membrane and closer to the site of
camp synthesis.
in this study, we set out to study the camp response to
gpcr stimulation of the transmembrane ac with  xxxd124xxx  in
hek293 cells with the aim of defining the role of pdes in the
generation of a subplasma membrane pool of high camp. we
applied an imaging approach for real-time monitoring of camp
dynamics in single living cells and used fret-based biosensors
selectively targeted to different subcellular domains. we found
that the camp response in the subplasma membrane compartment is higher as compared with the bulk cytosol because of a
compartmentalized  xxxg1700xxx  located in the cytosol that keeps the
level of the second messenger low in this compartment. indeed,
genetic ablation of  xxxg1700xxx  inverted the direction of the camp
gradient, resulting in a higher concentration of the second messenger in the cytosol as compared with the subplasma membrane compartment. on the contrary, genetic ablation of  xxxg1698xxx 
did not affect the direction of the gradient. the camp gradient
was completely abolished only when the expression of both
 xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  was blocked. these results demonstrate
that the concerted activity of  xxxg1698xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  is sufficient to
generate an intracellular camp gradient in response to  xxxd124xxx  in
hek293 cells. we also found that dislocation of  xxxg1700xxx  from
its anchoring sites by means of the overexpression of catalytically inactive enzymes dissipated the camp gradient, indicating that the compartmentalization of  xxxg1700xxx  is responsible for
shaping such a gradient.
intriguingly, we found that the inhibition of endogenous
pka with  xxxd477xxx  completely abolished the camp gradient between the plasma membrane and bulk cytosol. on the contrary,
the overexpression of pka via pde activation increased the
steepness of the subplasma membrane camp gradient generated by  xxxd124xxx . these results indicate that pka not only has a
role in shaping the intracellular camp gradient upon receptor
stimulation but also that pka itself can reinforce the boundaries between the intracellular camp compartments and can selfregulate the specificity of its own activity.
in this study, we show for the first time that a compartment deep inside the cell may accumulate higher levels of
camp as compared with the bulk cytosol. these findings demonstrate that multiple and contiguous domains with different
concentrations of camp can be generated simultaneously inside the cell irrespective of their distance from the site of synthesis of the second messenger. to explain such findings, we
must assume that pdes, rather than acting as enzymatic barriers
to camp diffusion from the plasma membrane to the bulk cytosol, are organized to generate local drains that dump camp in
defined compartments. such a mechanism of control of camp
diffusion may be more general and may also apply to the production of nonuniform intracellular camp domains in response

published november 6, 2006

to soluble ac activation. therefore, we propose a new model
whereby camp is free to diffuse from the site of synthesis and
to accumulate in the cell to levels effective for pka activation
except in those domains in which localized pdes degrade it to
protect sensitive targets from inappropriate activation.

materials and methods
reagents
dme, opti-mem, fbs, l-glutamine, penicillin, trypsin/edta, pbs, and lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from invitrogen.  xxxd124xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx  were
obtained from sigma-aldrich. restriction enzymes, t4 ligase, and shrimp
ap were purchased from new england biolabs, inc. fugene-6 transfection reagent was obtained from roche.

activation constants and apparent dissociation constants determination
to determine apparent activation constants for pka-gfp and mppka-gfp,
the prsetb vectors carrying the riibeta, mpriibeta, or calpha subunits were introduced into bl21(de3) (stratagene) for heterologous protein expression in
bacteria. individual subunits were subsequently puriﬁed with ni– xxxd2739xxx  resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions (qiagen).
puriﬁed proteins were buffer changed by gel ﬁltration to 20 mm mops,
150 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, 100 mum atp, and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
ph 7.0 (dialysis buffer), to remove imidazole. for pka holoenzyme formation, pka-r (pka-gfp and mppka-gfp) and pka calpha subunits (slice et al.,
1989; herberg et al., 1993) were mixed in a molar ratio of 1.5:1.0,
and dialysis was performed overnight with three buffer changes against
dialysis buffer (herberg et al., 1993). for the determination of activation
constants, a coupled spectrophotometric assay (cook et al., 1982) was performed using the peptide kemptide (lrraslg; biosynthan) as the substrate.
phosphotransferase activity was measured in an assay mixture consisting
of 100 mm mops, ph 7.0, 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm phosphoenol pyruvate,
1 mm atp, 200 mum nadh, 1 mm dtt, 15 u/ml lactate dehydrogenase
(roche), and 70 u/ml pyruvate kinase (roche). for the reaction, 100 mul
of assay mixture, 20 nm pka holoenzyme, and 1 mul kemptide peptide
(200 mum) were mixed in a quartz cuvette. the enzymatic activity (∆e340nm ×
min−1) was monitored at room temperature using a spectrophotometer
(lambda bio uv/vis; perkinelmer). ec50 values for activation were determined by preincubating the pka holoenzyme with increasing concentrations of camp for 1 min in assay mixture before starting the reaction with
kemptide peptide. data points were determined in duplicates, and experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. statistical analyses
were performed using prism 4.0 software (graphpad software).
to determine in vivo apparent dissociation constants for h30,
mph30, and nlsh30, hela cells expressing the camp sensor were injected
with known concentrations of camp via a patch pipette, and fret changes
were recorded as described in the fret imaging section. cells were continuously superfused at 2 ml/min in a standard extracellular solution, ecs-1,
which contained 150 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes,
2 mm cacl2, 2 mm pyruvate, and 5 mm glucose, ph 7.4. patch pipettes
were ﬁlled with an intracellular solution, ics-1, containing 120 mm kaspartate, 10 mm tea-cl, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, 10 mm cscl,
0.3 mm gtp-na, 3 mm atp-k (adjusted to ph 7.2 with koh), 5 mm
bapta, 1 mm thapsigargin, 0.1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , and 0.007–0.18 mm camp
as indicated and ﬁltered through 0.22-mum pores (millipore). only cells

cell culture and transfection
hek293 cells were grown in dme containing 10% fbs supplemented with
2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% co2. for transient expression, cells
were seeded onto 24-mm diameter round glass coverslips, and transfections were performed at 50–70% conﬂuence with fugene-6 transfection
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1–2 mug dna
per coverslip. imaging experiments were performed after 24–48 h.
to achieve the selective knockdown of  xxxg1698xxx  or  xxxg1700xxx  subfamilies, we used double-stranded 21-mer rna duplexes (dharmacon) targeted at regions of sequence that are unique to each of these subfamilies
as described previously (lynch et al., 2005). each sirna duplex was delivered into target cells via the reagent lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen).
speciﬁcally, 5 mul lipofectamine 2000 (1 mg/ml) was diluted in 100 mul
opti-mem, and, separately, 125 pmol of each sirna sample and 1 mug
camp sensor dna were diluted in 100 mul opti-mem. 200 mul sirna–dna
transfection complexes were added to each well, and the plates were
incubated for 3–4 h at 37°c (5% co2). these complexes were then
removed and replaced with dme. imaging experiments were performed
after 48 h.

construct generation
the membrane-targeted version of the r-cfp subunit of the pka-based
camp sensor (lissandron et al., 2005) was generated by inserting the nterminal targeting signal mgcikskrkdnlndd (mp) from lyn kinase at the
n terminus of r-cfp. this becomes posttranslationally myristoylated and
palmitoylated, resulting in its targeting to membrane rafts. the camp
epac1-based sensor, called h30, was provided by k. jalink (the netherlands cancer institute, amsterdam, netherlands) and corresponds to the
cfp-epac(deltadep-cd)-yfp sensor (ponsioen et al., 2004). the membranetargeted version of h30 was generated by fusion at the n terminus of the
mgcikskrkdnlndd plasma membrane–targeting sequence. the nucleartargeted version of h30 was generated by fusion of the nuclear localization
signal pkkkrkveda (nls) at the c terminus (dipilato et al., 2004).
untagged pka was generated by cloning both the riibeta subunit of
pka and the calpha subunit of pka into pcdna3.1 (invitrogen). constructs for
the expression of pka subunits in escherichia coli were generated by cloning riibeta, mpriibeta, and calpha into prsetb (invitrogen).

that displayed a seal resistance of >2 gomega before achieving the whole cell
conﬁguration were retained. cells admitted to the analysis after achieving
the whole cell conﬁguration were further characterized by an access resistance of <12 momega and an apparent membrane resistance of >300momega.
at least six cells were analyzed for each concentration of camp.

fret imaging
fret imaging experiments were performed 24–48 h after transfection.
cells were maintained in hepes-buffered ringer-modiﬁed saline containing
125 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm na3po4, 1 mm mgs04, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm cacl2, and 20 mm hepes, ph 7.5, at room temperature (20–
22°c) and imaged on an inverted microscope (ix50; olympus) with a
60× na 1.4 oil immersion objective (olympus). the microscope was
equipped with a ccd camera (sensicam qe; pco), a software-controlled
monochromator (polychrome iv; till photonics), and a beam-splitter optical
device (multispec microimager; optical insights). images were acquired
using custom-made software and processed using imagej (national institutes of health). fret changes were measured as changes in the background-subtracted 480/545-nm ﬂuorescence emission intensities on
excitation at 430 nm and expressed as either r/r0, where r is the ratio at
time t and r0 is the ratio at time = 0 s, or ∆r/r0, where ∆r = r – r0.
confocal imaging
cells were stained with anti- xxxg1698xxx  and - xxxg1700xxx  monoclonal antibodies
(fabgennix). alexafluor488-conjugated anti–mouse antibody was used
as the secondary antibody. confocal images were acquired with an inverted microscope (eclipse te300; nikon) equipped with a spinning disk
confocal system (ultraview lci; perkinelmer) and a 12-bit ccd camera
(hamamatsu; orca er). cells were excited using the 488-nm line of a
krypton-argon laser (643-ryb-a02; melles griot) for imaging yfp and the
alexafluor488 ﬂuorophore and using the 405-nm diode laser (iflex2000;
point source) for imaging cfp.
