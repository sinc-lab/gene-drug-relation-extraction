 xxxd1798xxx  (anti-tac, zenapax) in the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma
ta waldmann
metabolism branch, center for cancer research, national cancer institute, nih, bethesda, md, usa

 xxxd1798xxx  (zenapax) identiﬁes the  xxxg216xxx  of the
interleukin-2 (il-2) receptor and blocks the interaction of
this cytokine with its growth factor receptor. the scientiﬁc
basis for the choice of the  xxxg1175xxx   xxxg216xxx  as a
target for monoclonal antibody-mediated therapy of
leukemia/lymphoma is that very few normal cells express
 xxxg1175xxx  alpha, whereas the abnormal t cells in patients with
an array of lymphoid malignancies express this receptor. in
1997,  xxxd1798xxx  was approved by the fda for use in the
prevention of renal allograft rejection. in addition, anti-tac
provided effective therapy for select patients with t-cell
malignancies and an array of inﬂammatory autoimmune
disorders. finally, therapy with this antibody armed with
90
y has led to clinical responses in the majority of patients
with adult t-cell leukemia. these insights concerning the
il-2/ xxxg1175xxx  system facilitated the development of
effective  xxxd1798xxx  antibody therapy for select patients
with leukemia/lymphoma.

introduction
in 1981, in our laboratory, uchiyama reported the
development of the anti-tac monoclonal antibody
directed toward the interleukin-2 (il-2) receptor alpha
subunit (uchiyama et al., 1981a, b). the  xxxg1175xxx 
subunit identiﬁed by the murine monoclonal antibody,
anti-tac, was shown to be a densely glyclosylated,
sulfated integral membrane protein with an apparent mr
of 55 000 (leonard et al., 1982, 1984, 1985). the il-2
receptor is composed of 272 amino acids including a 21
amino-acid signal peptide, a single hydrophobic membrane region of 19 amino acids and a very short 13
amino-acid cytoplasmic domain (leonard et al., 1984).
the cytoplasmic domain of the  xxxg1175xxx  alpha
subunit appeared to be too small for enzymatic
function. furthermore, it did not contain a cytoplasmic
tyrosine. thus, the issue was how the  xxxg1175xxx 
signals were transduced to the nucleus if there was only

an  xxxg1175xxx   xxxg216xxx . furthermore, there was the
issue of the structural explanation for the great
difference in afﬁnity between high- (10 11 m) and low10 8 m) afﬁnity receptors. we resolved these issues in
parallel with investigators in the laboratory of warren
leonard by co-discovering a novel non-tac 70 kda il-2
binding protein,  xxxg1175xxx  beta, that is shared with il-15
(sharon et al., 1986; tsudo et al., 1986). subsequently,
the high-afﬁnity  xxxg1175xxx  was shown to also include
the 64 kda  xxxg1175xxx  g chain (or gc) shared by il-4,  xxxg1183xxx ,
il-9, il-15 and il-21 (sugamura et al., 1996)). the
cellular distribution of the 55 kda subunit of the il-2
receptor deﬁned using the anti-tac monoclonal antibody revealed that o5% of unstimulated human
peripheral blood t cells react with the anti-tac
monoclonal antibody (waldmann, 1989). however,
high  xxxg1175xxx  alpha expression was demonstrated on an
array of abnormal cells including the malignant cells in
patients with adult t-cell leukemia (atl), cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, hairy
cell b-cell leukemia, and the reed sternberg and
associated polyclonal t cells in hodgkin’s disease as
well as acute and chronic granulocytic leukemia cells
(waldmann 1986, 1989). furthermore, such abnormalities of  xxxg1175xxx  alpha expression have been demonstrated
in the autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, aplastic anemia,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, crohn’s disease,
sarcoidosis, scleroderma, noninfectious uveitis, chronic
active hepatitis, multiple sclerosis and tropical spastic
paraparesis (tsp) (waldmann, 1989, 2003). furthermore, such elevations of il-2 r alpha expression have
been detected in the serum of patients during organ
allograft rejection and from those with graft-versus-host
disease (rubin and nelson, 1990). this discordance in
 xxxg1175xxx  alpha expression between normal cells, which we
wish to retain that do not express the receptor, and
abnormal cells in disease that express the receptor
provided the scientiﬁc basis for the use of anti-tac and
its humanized form,  xxxd1798xxx , for an array of clinical
conditions including cd25-expressing leukemias and
lymphomas, autoimmune diseases and to prevent
allograft rejection. in 1997  xxxd1798xxx , the humanized
form of this antibody was approved by the fda for use
in the prevention of renal allograft rejection (vincenti
et al., 1998; wiseman and faulds, 1999). in addition, we
and our collaborators demonstrated that  xxxd1798xxx  is
of value in the treatment of patients with non-infectious
uveitis, multiple sclerosis and the neurological disease,

myelopathy (ham)/tsp (lehky et al., 1998; nussenblatt
et al., 1999; bielekova et al., 2004). others demonstrated
therapeutic efﬁcacy with  xxxd1798xxx  in patients with
pure red cell aplasia, aplastic anemia and psoriasis
(krueger et al., 2000; maciejewski et al., 2003; sloand
et al., 2006). in addition, unmodiﬁed  xxxd1798xxx  as well
as  xxxd1798xxx  armed with toxins and radionuclides has
proven effective in the treatment of select patients with
t-cell leukemias and lymphomas and hodgkin’s disease
(waldmann et al., 1988, 1993, 1995; kreitman et al.,
2000). these latter studies will be the primary focus of
this review.
 xxxd1798xxx  therapy for patients receiving organ
allografts
organ allograft rejection is associated with an elevated
serum-soluble  xxxg1175xxx  alpha level that is linked to the
activation of t cells mediated by major histocompatibility complex mismatch recognition. two major phase
iii studies were used to evaluate the clinical efﬁcacy of
 xxxd1798xxx  linked to immunosuppression compared
with a placebo with the same immunosuppressive
regimen (vincenti et al., 1998; nashan et al., 1999). in
the two phase iii multicenter studies, which were
double-blind and randomized, the end points were the
incidence of biopsy-proven rejection that occurred in the
ﬁrst 6 months after transplantation. a total of 535
patients was studied. in both studies, the patients
receiving  xxxd1798xxx  and immunosuppression had a
signiﬁcantly reduced biopsy conﬁrmed number of
episodes of rejection when compared with the patient
groups receiving standard immunosuppression plus
placebo. in one of the studies, the patients on
 xxxd1798xxx  therapy had better graft function, reduced
requirement for antithrombocyte or antilymphocyte
globulin, lower administered corticosteroid doses, a
lower incidence of cytomegalovirus infection, a lower
incidence of infectious deaths and a greater 1-year
survival than did the patients on placebo (nashan et al.,
1999). on the basis of the efﬁcacy in these multicenter
trials and the lack of associated increase in toxicity, in
1997 the fda provided marketing clearance for the use
of  xxxd1798xxx  in the prevention of acute kidney
transplant rejection. in subsequent studies, in clinical
trials involving a large group of recipients,  xxxd1798xxx 
provided a reduction in the rejection episodes in patients
receiving renal, liver, cardiac and pancreatic islet
transplants (beniaminovitz et al., 2000; eckhoff et al.,
2000; shapiro et al., 2000).

cells in hodgkin’s disease. we developed a murine model
of human atl (met-i) to evaluate the different
therapeutic approaches involving  xxxd1798xxx  (phillips
et al., 2000). to establish this murine model of human
atl, we injected human atl cells into non-obese,
diabetic (nod), severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(scid) mice (phillips et al., 2000). the transferred
disease progressed to death of the mice after 4–6 weeks.
various forms of antibody directed to the  xxxg1175xxx 
 xxxg216xxx  including  xxxd1798xxx , the humanized form
of anti-tac, murine anti-tac and the 7g7/b6 monoclonal
antibody that targets this  xxxg1175xxx  subunit at an
epitope other than the il-2 and anti-tac binding sites,
signiﬁcantly delayed the progression of the leukemia and
prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice (phillips
et al., 2000). thus, it appeared that in this met-i model,
 xxxd1798xxx  and the other  xxxg1175xxx  alpha receptor-directed
antibodies acted by a mechanism that had not been
anticipated. the prevailing view was that the antibodies
to the  xxxg1175xxx  alpha receptor have an effective action that
is limited to the blockade of the interaction of il-2 with
its growth factor receptor, thereby inducing cytokine
deprivation-mediated apoptotic cell death (depper et al.,
1984). however, the 7g7/b6 monoclonal antibody
deﬁnes an epitope on the  xxxg1175xxx  subunit that is
not involved in il-2 binding. furthermore, in the met-i
model, the human atl cells obtained from the spleen of
the leukemia-bearing mice did not produce human il-2
nor did they respond to murine il-2. we considered an
alternative mechanism of action of the anti-cd25
antibodies, by requiring fcr receptor expression on host
cells such as monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated  xxxd1798xxx  in
the therapy of the met-i model in both wild-type scid/
nod mice as well as in scid/nod fcr g / mice that
lacked effective fcrgi, fcrgiii and fcrgiv receptors
(zhang et al., 2004). the  xxxg1175xxx  alpha directed monoclonal antibody,  xxxd1798xxx , that was effective in wildtype mice was not active in these fcr gamma / mice,
supporting the view that an action requiring fc-receptor
expression on monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes was probably involved in the therapeutic efﬁcacy in
this model of atl (zhang et al., 2004). thus, in terms of
its mode of action,  xxxd1798xxx  acts by a number of
mechanisms that include blockade of the interaction of
il-2 with its receptor as well as by an fcr receptor
requiring mechanism. recently, yet another mechanism
of action has been reported. in particular, in humans the
interaction of  xxxd1798xxx  with the  xxxg1175xxx  was
associated with a 4- to 20-fold increase in the number of
circulating cd56 bright, cd25 expressing, il-10 secreting natural killer cells that mediate negative immunomodulatory actions (li et al., 2005; bielekova et al., 2006).

 xxxd1798xxx  therapy of  xxxg1175xxx  alpha (cd25) expressing
leukemia/lymphoma
 xxxg1175xxx  alpha, the target of  xxxd1798xxx , is expressed by the
malignant cells from select patients with atl/lymphoma,
cutaneous t-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, granulocytic neoplasms and

retrovirus htlv-i-associated atl (waldmann et al.,
1988). the retrovirus htlv-i encodes a transactivating
protein, tax, that stimulates the transcription of
numerous host genes, including those of il-2 and  xxxg1174xxx  alpha (uchiyama et al., 1977; jeang, 2001). the
malignant atl cells constitutively expressed approximately 10 000–28 000  xxxg1175xxx  alpha receptor subunits
identiﬁed by the anti-tac monoclonal antibody. these
observations stimulated us to perform a therapeutic trial
with the unmodiﬁed murine version of the anti-tac
monoclonal antibody. seven of the 19 patients developed mixed (one case), partial (four cases) or complete
(two cases) responses (waldmann et al., 1993). in one
case, the remission has persisted for more than 17 years
after initiation of a short course of antibody therapy.
none of the patients treated suffered any untoward
reactions. however, six of 10 patients treated with the
murine antibody that developed clinical remissions
produced antibodies to this therapeutic agent. additional limitations in the murine anti-tac antibody were
that it had a short in vivo survival of only 50 h in the
circulation of humans, precluding its long-term use as an
agent to provide the antibody-mediated saturation of
receptors that is required to prevent the interaction of
the growth factor il-2 with its receptor. an additional
problem was that the antibody did not function in
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) with
human mononuclear cells and was relatively ineffective
as a cytocidal agent.
we joined with cary queen to generate a humanized
version of the anti-tac monoclonal antibody ( xxxd1798xxx ) that is reactive with the human  xxxg1175xxx  alpha
subunit (queen et al., 1989; junghans et al., 1990). in
this effort, the human igg1 framework sequence from
the eu-myeloma antibody was chosen to be as homologous as possible to the original mouse antibody to
reduce any deformation of the mouse complementarity
determining regions (cdrs). second, computer modeling was used to identify several framework amino acids
from the mouse antibody that interact with the cdrs or
directly with antigen. these amino acids were retained
as were the murine or more typical human amino acids
and were transferred to the human framework along
with the murine cdrs. this latter action proved to be
critical in generating a high-afﬁnity humanized anti-tac
( xxxd1798xxx ). the parent murine anti-tac molecule had
an afﬁnity of 9  10 9 m to its target  xxxg1175xxx  alpha,
whereas the hyperchimeric humanized version had an
afﬁnity of 3  10 9 m – still very high (queen et al.,
1989). the original humanized anti-tac monoclonal
antibody,  xxxd1798xxx , and the parent murine version
manifested comparable inhibition of the t-cell proliferation in response to the tetanus-toxoid antigen
indicating that humanization was not associated with
the loss of functional activity. furthermore, in contrast
to the murine version,  xxxd1798xxx  manifested adcc
with human mononuclear cells (junghans et al., 1990).
finally, the humanized version  xxxd1798xxx  had a
prolonged terminal t1/2 of 20 7 0.6 days in humans.
 xxxd1798xxx  is being evaluated in clinical trials of
patients with cd25-expressing atl (morris and

waldmann, 2000). an escalation analysis was used to
deﬁne the dose required to maintain saturation of the
 xxxg1175xxx . in patients with high numbers of
leukemic/lymphoma cells, a dose of 8 mg/kg of  xxxd1798xxx  every 3 weeks was required to maintain saturation
of the  xxxg1175xxx  alpha expressed on the lymph node cells of
the patients.  xxxd1798xxx  therapy was associated with
partial responses that were predominantly observed in
patients with smoldering or chronic atl who appear to
be in the il-2/ xxxg1175xxx  alpha autocrine phase of their
disease.
 xxxd1798xxx  cytotoxic conjugates: immunotoxin-linked
monoclonal antibodies
a limitation in the use of  xxxd1798xxx  for the treatment
of t-cell leukemia/lymphoma is the fact that like other
unmodiﬁed monoclonal antibodies it is relatively
ineffective as a cytocidal agent. this limited efﬁcacy
of unmodiﬁed  xxxd1798xxx  in leukemia/lymphoma
therapy led to the alternative approach of using
this antibody as a carrier of cytotoxic agents such as
toxins or radionuclides. in one series of studies in
conjunction with krietman and pastan, we evaluated
the clinical efﬁcacy of a fusion immunotoxin that
involved a truncated version of pseudomonas exotoxin
a (pe38) linked genetically to the fv region of antitac (kreitman et al., 2000). the anti-tac fv pe38
(lmb-2) was evaluated in a phase i/ii clinical trial
that involved 35 patients who had leukemia/lymphoma
that expressed cd25 ( xxxg1175xxx  alpha). in this trial, there
were eight responders including four with hairy cell
leukemia and one each with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, hodgkin’s disease, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and atl.
 xxxd1798xxx  armed with radionuclide
in an alternative approach, anti-tac and its humanized
form,  xxxd1798xxx , were armed with radionuclides for
use in systemic radioimmunotherapy of leukemia/
lymphoma. our systemic radioimmunotherapy clinical
trials have focused on the use of 90y linked to anti-tac.
eighteen patients with atl were treated with a total of
55 doses of 90y-labeled anti-tac involving 5–15 ci of
90
y-labeled anti-tac per patient dose (waldmann et al.,
1995). ten of the evaluable patients responded to 90yanti-tac with partial (eight) or complete (two) remissions. the only meaningful (>grade 3) toxicity was
limited to the hematopoietic system. recently, we have
also had encouraging results with the humanized form
of 90y  xxxd1798xxx  in the treatment of patients with
hodgkin’s disease where there were seven complete
responses (crs) and ﬁve partial responses (prs)
observed in the 17 patients with hodgkin’s disease
treated with repeated doses of 15 ci of 90y (o’mahony
et al., 2006). thus, it appears that  xxxd1798xxx  armed
with the radionuclide 90y provides meaningful therapy
for select patients with atl and hodgkin’s disease.

future directions
a number of approaches could be exploited to
optimize the action of  xxxd1798xxx  in the therapy of
 xxxg1175xxx  alpha (cd25) expressing lymphoid leukemias
and lymphomas. a paradigm is being established that
monoclonal antibodies will not be used in monotherapy of human malignancy, but rather will be used in
association with an array of agents including chemotherapeutic agents that utilize a different mode of
action. in the murine met-i model, there was
considerable synergy when the  xxxd1798xxx  antibody
was used in conjunction with velcade (bortezoumib) or
with ﬂavopiridol (tan and waldmann, 2002; zhang
et al., 2005). furthermore, another insight derived
from the studies involving systemic radioimmunotherapy in preclinical models of adult human t-cell
leukemia should be translated into clinical trials. in
particular, patients who have t-cell leukemia with its
isolated cells could be treated with antibodies linked to

select alpha-emitting radionuclides such as astatine-211
in lieu of the beta-emitting radionuclide yttium-90
whose cross-ﬁre effect is relatively ineffective when
directed toward isolated malignant cells (zhang et al.,
2006).
in summary, basic insights concerning the il-2/ xxxg1175xxx 
system, developed using the  xxxd1798xxx  monoclonal
antibodies, when coupled with the experience with this
humanized antibody in clinical trials are providing an
effective monoclonal antibody-mediated approach for
the treatment of select patients with  xxxg1175xxx  alpha
(cd25) expressing leukemia and lymphoma.
