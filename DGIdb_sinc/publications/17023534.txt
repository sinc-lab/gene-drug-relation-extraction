a number of conditions, including osteoporosis, frailty, and
sexual dysfunction in both men and women have been improved using androgens. however, androgens are not widely
used for these indications because of the side effects associated with these drugs. we describe an  xxxg183xxx  (ar)
ligand that maintains expected anabolic activities with substantially diminished activity in the prostate.  xxxd1351xxx  is a
nonsteroidal, nonaromatizable, highly selective ligand for the
ar, exhibiting virtually no affinity for the other intracellular
receptors. we determined that ar bound to  xxxd1351xxx  exhibits
a unique pattern of protein-protein interactions compared
with testosterone,  xxxd2136xxx  (an orally available steroidal androgen), and other steroids, suggesting that
 xxxd1351xxx  alters the conformation of the ligand-binding domain. we demonstrated that  xxxd1351xxx  is fully active in cellbased models of bone and muscle.  xxxd1351xxx  exhibited anabolic

activity on muscle and bone with reduced impact on prostate
growth in rodent models. biomechanical testing of bones from
animals treated with  xxxd1351xxx  showed strong enhancement of
bone strength above sham levels.  xxxd1351xxx  was also efficacious in a sex-behavior model in male rats measuring mounts,
intromissions, ejaculations, and copulation efficiency. these
results with an orally available, nonaromatizable androgen
demonstrate the important role of the ar and androgens in
mediating a number of beneficial effects in bone, muscle, and
sexual function independent from the conversion of androgens into estrogenic ligands. taken together, these results
suggest that orally active, nonsteroidal selective androgen
receptor modulators may be useful therapeutics for enhancing muscle, bone, and sexual function. (endocrinology 148:
363–373, 2007)

s

upplemental androgen therapy is used to
treat a variety of male disorders characterized by low
testosterone (t) levels. in men 75 yr of age and older but
otherwise in good health, mean plasma t levels drop to 35%
of that of a comparable population of younger men (1). this
age-associated t decrease, or andropause, may cause the
fatigue, depression, reduced muscle and bone mass, decreased hematopoiesis, and sexual dysfunction sometimes
found in elderly men (2). androgens not only are effective in
the elderly, but supplemental androgens have also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis, including
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. they are also efficacious at building muscle and bone in wasting diseases such

as cancer and hiv (3). furthermore, androgens may have a
role in the treatment of certain forms of female (4) and male
(5) sexual dysfunction.
despite the mounting evidence that androgens are effective in a growing number of indications for both men and
women, they are not routinely prescribed. there are a number of problems with current therapies that limit their usefulness. these include prostate hypertrophy and the potential for induction or acceleration of prostate cancer disease in
men, the development of male secondary sex characteristics
in women (hirsutism and deepening of voice), and acne in
both sexes. the route of administration is also an issue;
steroidal androgens cannot be given orally without risking
liver toxicity. injectable t or t esters can cause problems that
are associated with abnormally high t immediately after
administration. other topical options such as t patches and
gels can cause local skin irritation and spousal transfer and
are cumbersome to use.
although androgens clearly have a valuable effect on bone
in the clinic, conversion of t into estrogen by aromatization
has clouded the interpretation of the efficacy of androgens
directly on bone, in particular because of the well characterized effects of estrogen on bone in females (6). furthermore, the severe osteoporosis found in an  xxxg730xxx 
(er)-␣-negative male has validated the important role the er
plays in the male skeleton (7). that estrogens are important

does not diminish the need for androgen action in bone.
nonaromatizable androgens are known to be active in cancellous bone without aromatization to estrogens (8). furthermore, male  xxxg183xxx  (ar) knockout mice develop severe osteopenia (8 –10).
the development of an orally active, selective ar modulator (sarm) with significant anabolic activity in muscle,
bone, and sexual function but with a reduction in the severity
of side effects may be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis,
frailty, and some forms of sexual dysfunction (11, 12).
compounds derived from known ar antagonists ( xxxd334xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx ) have been found to have relatively
little effect on prostate while maintaining effects on muscle,
but little or nothing is known about their effects on bone or
on sexual behavior. these molecules are rapidly cleared in
the liver (13, 14) and are thus not suitable for oral administration. other sarms have been described, but these exhibit
a weak separation between their effects on prostate and bone
and are not orally available (14, 15). moreover, the mechanism by which these sarms separate anabolic efficacy from
prostate effects is unknown (14 –20).
the ar is a ligand-regulated transcription factor that modulates gene expression either by binding directly to the promoter of target genes or by affecting gene expression indirectly through the interaction with protein coregulators. it is
these interactions that result in the regulation of gene transcription and a response to androgens. the ar contains three
domains involved in transcriptional regulatory activity, including a central dna-binding domain, a c-terminal ligandbinding domain (lbd), and an n-terminal activation domain, all of which are capable of binding coregulatory
proteins. many of these regulatory proteins contain a specific
motif of amino acids (lxxll) that binds directly to the activation function 2 (af2) region of the lbd of the receptor
(21). ar itself has a related sequence, fxxlf, in the n terminus. this sequence interacts directly with the lbd in a
hormone-dependent manner (22, 23). the ar n terminus is
bound to the c terminus in the presence of hormone in living
cells (24). interaction between the receptor lbd and the
lxxll motif of the coregulatory proteins or the receptor n
terminus depends on the nature of the ligand that is bound
to the receptor. some agonist ligands allow this interaction,
many antagonists do not, and some ligands alter the affinity
and specificity of coactivator interactions (25–27). ligands
that change the coregulator interaction profile may also alter
the function of ar when bound to these molecules as has
been seen for other steroid receptors (28).
this manuscript describes the discovery and characterization of  xxxd1351xxx .  xxxd1351xxx  exhibits anabolic activity in in
vitro and in vivo models of bone and muscle response to
androgen, despite reduced interaction of ar with certain
coactivators relative to steroids. in contrast to the effects of
t and dihydrotestosterone (dht), prostate growth in the
 xxxd1351xxx -treated animals was markedly reduced. furthermore, this nonaromatizable compound is fully capable of
inhibiting resorption in cancellous bone and enhancing the
bone formation rate in cortical bone. the latter is solely a
property of androgens, because estrogens under the same
conditions inhibit cortical bone formation (29). these effects
in bone result in an overall increase in bone strength well

beyond the level achieved with endogenous t.  xxxd1351xxx  is
fully efficacious at preventing castration-induced loss of sexual function in male rats. taken together, these data show
that  xxxd1351xxx  exhibits a beneficial profile that would be
useful in a clinical setting characterized by low levels of t,
reduced bone mineral density, or reduced muscle mass without some of the side effects of currently marketed steroidal
androgens.
materials and methods
in vitro binding
extracts from spodoptera frugiperda 9 (sf9) moth cells infected with
recombinant baculovirus expressing the indicated receptor were used in
labeled hormone-binding assays. growth and purification of recombinant human ar baculovirus was done as described (25–27). labeled
dht (1–2 nm [3h]dht) (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo) at 130
ci/mmol was used, and varying concentrations of competing ligand
(0 –10⫺5 m). dissociation constant (kd) values for the analogs were calculated by application of the cheng-prussof equation.
 xxxg1602xxx  (mr),  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), and
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) expression in the baculovirus system and
binding assays were conducted similarly except that labeled ligands
were 1–2 nm [3h]aldosterone (trk 434; amersham, arlington heights,
il) with a specific activity of 60 ci/mmol, 1–2 nm [3h]dexamethsone at
84 ci/mmol, and 2–3 nm [3h]progesterone at 93 ci/mmol (sigma),
respectively. each binding assay point was done in duplicate, and each
full experiment was repeated three to five times.

reporter assays
dmem and eagle’s mem were obtained from biowhittaker (walkersville, md). all fetal bovine serum (fbs) was purchased from hyclone
(logan, ut). cv-1 cells were obtained from american type culture
collection (rockville, md).
cv1 or mda-mb-453 cells derived from a human mammary carcinoma (atcc htb 131) were cultured in dmem supplemented with
10% charcoal resin-stripped fbs. cells were seeded 48 h before transfection in 96-well microtiter plates. cells were transiently transfected by
the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (30) with a reporter
plasmid, mmtv-luc, containing the mouse mammary tumor virus
(mmtv) long terminal repeat linked to luciferase, a ␤-galactosidase
(␤-gal) expression plasmid, pcmv-␤-gal, coding for the constitutive
expression of escherichia coli ␤-gal, and filler dna (pgem) in the presence (cv1) or absence (mda) of hgr expression in plasmid (rsvhgr).

il-6 repression assay
the human osteoblast cell line saos-2 was transfected with a human
ar expression plasmid and a luciferase reporter plasmid consisting of
the il-6 promoter controlling luciferase expression. saos-2 cells (3 ⫻ 106)
were seeded in a t225 flask and cultured for 24 h in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs. fugene 6 transfection reagent (roche molecular
biochemicals, indianapolis, in), was used to transiently transfect the
cells according to the manufacturer’s specifications. transient transfections were performed at a 3:1 (vol/wt) fugene 6/dna ratio containing
0.7 ␮g human ar expression plasmid and 1.4 ␮g luciferase reporter
plasmid per flask of cells for 16 h. cells were removed from the flask
using trypsin and plated into 96-well plates (6 ⫻ 103 cells per well) in
dmem-charcoal absorbed (ca) fbs. compounds were diluted in
dmem-ca fbs containing tnf␣ (10 ng/ml) and il-1␤ (1 ng/ml) and
the cell incubated for 16 h in the absence and presence of compound
(from 10⫺11 to 10⫺6 m) and with dmem-ca fbs alone. medium was
removed, and cells were lysed in triton x-100 buffer.

cell line derived from a xenograft that was serially propagated in mice
after castration-induced regression and relapse of the parental, androgen-dependent cwr22 xenograft. cells were cultured in imdm supplemented with 10% fbs. cells were seeded 24 h before transfection in
24-well plates. cells were transiently transfected using fugene 6
(roche), according to the manufacturer’s specifications. transient transfections were performed at a 6/1 (vol/wt) fugene 6/dna ratio containing 25 ng psa reporter and 25 ng of a ␤-gal expression plasmid,
pcmv-␤-gal, coding for the constitutive expression of escherichia coli
␤-gal, and 50 ng filler dna (pgem) per well for 18 h. compounds were
diluted in imdm-2% charcoal-treated-fbs medium and cells treated for
24 h and lysed and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (torcon).

two-hybrid assays
gal4 dna-binding domain-peptide fusions were constructed by first
synthesizing the following oligonucleotides (all shown 5⬘ to 3⬘): fxxlf

the forward and reverse pairs were annealed by heating to 95 c and
cooling slowly and then cloned into pm (clontech, palo alto, ca) and
cut with ecori and xbai. the resulting plasmids were sequenced to
verify the in-frame fusion to the gal4 dna-binding domain of the fxxlf
(the polypeptide sktyrgafqnlfqsvrevi) or the d11/f (vesgssrfmqlfmandllt) (31). for experiments using gal4-peptides, experiments were conducted as described (25–27). hepg2 liver cells lacking
ar were transfected with reporter gal4d5luc3, vp16-har, gal4-peptide construct, rous sarcoma virus (rsv)-␤-gal as a normalization control, and pgem as carrier dna. transfections were carried out using
fugene 6 per the manufacturer’s protocol (roche). after 24 h treatment,
cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and ␤-gal activity. all values
shown are the mean of three wells and are representative of multiple
experiments.

gr interacting protein 1 ( xxxg1511xxx ) coactivation assay
a total of 3 ⫻ 106 cv-1 cells (american type culture collection) were
transfected with fugene 6 with 4 ␮g mmtv-luc, 0.5 ␮g rsv-␤-gal, 1
ng rsv-driven har expression plasmid, and either 1 ␮g pgem or
psg5. xxxg1511xxx  expression vector (kindly provided by m. stallcup, university of southern california). after 24 h, cells were trypsinized and
replated in 96-well plates (30,000 cells per well) with compounds as
indicated in eagle’s mem supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-treatedfbs. luciferase and ␤-gal assays were performed after 24 h of treatment.
all values shown are representative of four experiments done in
triplicate.

serum lh determination
serum (200 ␮l) was incubated at room temperature for 2–3 d with 100
␮l 1:100,000 diluted primary rabbit antibody (niddk antirat lh s-11
antibody), and 100 ␮l of [125i]iodinated lh (covance laboratories, inc.,
vienna, va) diluted to 200,000 –300,000 cpm/ml was added and the
incubation continued for an additional 24 h. bound lh was separated
from the free hormone by adding 50 ␮l of 4% normal rabbit antibody and
50 ␮l of 1:10 diluted goat antirabbit secondary antibody (antibodies,
inc., davis, ca) on beads followed by overnight incubation at 4 c and
centrifugation. pellets were counted in a 10-channel ␥-counter. the assay
has a minimum detectable lh amount of 0.001 ng/tube. the intra- and
interassay variability is less than 10%.

urine deoxypyridinoline (dpd) determination
urine dpd and creatinine were assayed at skeletech, inc. (bothell,
wa). both dpd and creatinine were assayed according to the protocol
of metra biosystems, inc. (mountain view, ca).

data analysis
the data were analyzed for the effects of androgens on orchidectomized (ordx) rats by anova, followed by fisher’s protected least
significant difference (plsd) test. p ⬍ 0.05 was the level necessary to
achieve statistical significance.

compounds and formulations
 xxxd1351xxx  was synthesized at ligand pharmaceuticals, inc., and  xxxd2136xxx  (9␣-fluoro-11␣-hydroxy-17␣-methyltestosterone) was
purchased from spectrum (new brunswick, nj; catalog no. fl-134).
both  xxxd1351xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx  were formulated as suspensions in
a vehicle containing 9.95%  xxxd2982xxx  400, 0.05% tween 80, and
0.9% carboxymethyl cellulose in water. the concentrations of test compounds corresponded to doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg per 4-ml
vehicle. calcein and tetracycline hydrochloride (sigma) were used for
bone labeling. calcein was dissolved in 2% nahco3 and tetracycline
hydrochloride in sterile water. both markers, which were used at a
concentration of 50 mg/ml, were injected in a volume of 0.1 ml, corresponding to a dose of 5 mg/250 g rat into the perivascular region at the
base of the tail.

animals
all procedures involving animals were approved by ligand’s institutional animal care and use committee.

two-week study
for the 2-wk studies (see fig. 3), adult (7-wk-old) sprague dawley
rats were purchased from harlan (indianapolis, in), orchidectomized,
and treated using oral gavage immediately after surgery with either
vehicle or  xxxd1351xxx  (1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg䡠d). twenty-four hours
after the last dose, the animals were euthanized by decapitation. the
ventral prostate and levator ani muscle were collected, dissected free of
adipose tissue, blotted dry, and weighed.

six-week study
for the 6-wk long-term bone study (see fig. 4), 7-wk-old male
sprague dawley rats (⬃250 g body weight) were used. animals were
housed two to three per cage, fed standard rodent chow (teklad, 8604)
containing 1.46% calcium, 0.99% phosphorus, and 4.96%  xxxd1682xxx  and
maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (lights on at 0600 h). animals
were acclimatized for 1 wk before beginning experiments. the first
bone-labeling marker, calcein (5 mg/rat䡠0.1 ml) was administered to the
animals by perivascular injection at the base of the tail 3 d before ordx.
at the beginning of the study (d 1), rats were arbitrarily allocated to
seven groups, with 10 animals per group. groups were treated with
compound by oral gavage (groups 1–3 were vehicle treated): 1) gonadally intact (baseline control group), 2) sham-operated, 3) ordx, 4)
ordx treated with  xxxd2136xxx  (100 mg/kg䡠d), and 5–7) ordx
treated with  xxxd1351xxx  at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg䡠d. on d 2, animals of the
baseline control group (group 1) were killed by decapitation, tibiae and
femora were isolated and tibiae transferred to 70% ethanol, and femora
were stored at ⫺80 c. on d 32 and 40 (10 and 2 d before being killed),
rats received tetracycline (5 mg/rat䡠0.1ml) as a second and third bonelabeling time point. urine was collected continuously over a 16-h period
in metabolic cages and frozen at ⫺80 c. cleared urine supernatants were
sent to skeletech for analysis of dpd and creatinine. at the end of the
study (6 wk), rats were weighed and then killed by decapitation. serum
was processed and stored at ⫺20 c for further analysis. long bones,
consisting of tibiae and femora of both hind limbs, were isolated and
tibiae transferred to 70% ethanol. femora were stored at ⫺80 c. tibiae
were evaluated using histomorphometric analysis.

histomorphometry
histomorphometric analyses of hind limb tibiae were carried out as
described (8, 32). multiple parameters of cortical bone (tibial diaphysis)
and cancellous bone (proximal tibia metaphysis) were measured using
a digitizing morphometry system. the system consisted of an epifluorescence microscope, a color video camera, and a digitizing pad (nu-

the lumbar vertebral body. the load and extension curve was collected
by the accompanied software (merlin ii; instron corp.). all tests were
conducted using a 5-kn load cell at a constant loading rate of 6 mm/min.

cortical bone measurements
ground transverse sections were used for morphometric analysis of
cortical bone. cross-sections of 150-mm thickness were cut at the tibiofibular junction with a low-speed saw (isomet) equipped with a diamond wafer blade. the sections were ground to a thickness of 15–20 ␮m
on a roughened glass plate and were mounted in glycerin before microscopic examination under uv illumination to visualize calcein and
tetracycline fluorochrome labeling. the following measurements were
performed: 1) periosteal bone formation rate (mm2/d ⫻ 10⫺3), calculated
as the area outside of initial calcein label and inside the periosteal surface
divided by the labeling period; 2) bone mineral apposition rate (␮m/d),
defined as the area outside of the initial calcein label and inside the
periosteal surface divided by the product of the labeled surface length
(see below) and the labeling period; and 3) periosteal mineralization rate,
calculated as the area bounded by each pair of tetracycline labels and
divided by the product of the length of the initial label and the labeling
period. these measurements are described in greater detail by baylink
et al. (33).

cancellous bone measurements
the tibiae were sectioned transversely at the mid-diaphysis with a
low-speed diamond saw and decalcified in 5%  xxxd2154xxx  in 10% formalin for several days. the bones were then bisected in the midsagittal
plane using a scalpel and dehydrated in ascending grades of alcohol
before infiltrating and embedding in glycol-methylmethacrylate, a mixture of methylmethacrylate and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (12.5/1).
the resulting blocks were sectioned at an indicated thickness of 5 ␮m
on a jung-reichart microtome (heidelberg, germany). the sections were
mounted on slides and subjected to morphometric analysis. cancellous
bone was examined in the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibia
metaphysis at a standard sampling site no less than 1 mm caudal to the
epiphysial growth plate. measured parameters of cancellous bone included 1) total bone area, defined as the total area of trabecular bone
present expressed as a percentage of the total tissue area (bone and
marrow area) in the sampling site, which was converted to a volume by
multiplication by unit thickness (bone volume/trabecular volume); 2)
cancellous bone perimeter, defined as the total trabecular surface length
present in the sampling site; 3) single- and double-labeled perimeters;
and 4) interlabeled widths.
the measured parameters were then used to calculate 1) percent
cancellous bone volume (cancellous bone area/total tissue area ⫻ 100%)
and 2) cancellous bone formation rate (double-labeled perimeters ⫹
single-labeled perimeters/2) ⫻ interlabeled widths/interval time/cancellous perimeters). all measurements and calculations were carried out
according to the standard nomenclature (34).

compression test of the fourth lumbar vertebral body
a compression test was used to determine the mechanical properties
of the lumbar vertebral body, as described (35). the lumbar vertebral
body test specimen was obtained by removing the two epiphyseal ends,
posterior pedicle arch, and spinous process from the whole vertebra
using a slow-speed saw. an electronic caliper was used to measure the
average dorsal to ventral diameter (a), side-to-side diameter (b), and
height (h). the maximal load (36), stiffness (s), and energy (w) were
obtained from the load and extension curve. the following parameters
were calculated from the measured values: cross-sectional area (csa) ⫽
(␲⫻ a ⫻ b)/4; ultimate strength (␴) ⫽ fu/csa; elastic modulus (e) ⫽
s/(csa/h); and toughness (t) ⫽ w/(csa ⫻ h). breaking strength is the
force necessary to compress/crush the bone (newtons). ultimate breaking strength is the crush force per area (newtons per square millimeter).

sexual behavior study
 xxxd1351xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx  were tested for effects on sexual behavior parameters in ordx hooded long-evans rats between 5 and 6
months of age. these animals have previously been shown to respond
to androgens (37, 38). ovariectomized female sprague dawley rats
(charles river, ma) were used as stimulus. rats were housed under a
reversed 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. before ordx, male rats were first
tested for consistent sex behavior with sexually receptive (stimulus)
females. males that reliably copulated over the course of several weeks
of testing were admitted to the treatment phase of the study.
the males were kept sexually active during a 6-wk interval between
screening tests and treatment by testing them in 20-min sex behavior
tests with stimulus females  xxxd2274xxx - to 14-d intervals. the males were
castrated and implanted with silastic capsules (30 mm long; inner diameter, 1.57 mm; outer diameter, 3.18 mm; dow corning, midland, mi)
containing 17␤-estradiol (17␤-e2) (sigma; lot 28h0818; 50 ␮g/ml in olive
oil) under isoflurane anesthesia. before implantation, the silastic capsules were rinsed twice with 0.1 m pbs (ph 7.4) for removal of 17␤-e2
from the exterior of the capsule and then stirred overnight in pbs to
facilitate the release of the 17␤-e2 from the interior of the capsule. the
males were subdivided into three groups, and animals in each group
were dosed daily by oral gavage (4 ml/kg) with one of the following
treatments: vehicle (n ⫽ 15), ,  xxxd1351xxx  (100 mg/kg in vehicle) (n ⫽ 16),
or  xxxd2136xxx  (100 mg/kg in vehicle) (n ⫽ 16). males were then
tested weekly at 6- or 7-d intervals starting 1 wk after surgery for 8 wk
with stimulus females (treatment phase of sexual behavior testing). the
males were killed 4 d after the last test session.

sixteen-week study

in vitro activity

the 16-wk long-term bone study (see fig. 4, g–i) was conducted
similarly to the 6-wk study with the following exceptions. nine-monthold male sprague dawley rats (⬃500 g body weight) were housed
individually and acclimatized for 2 wk. on d 2, animals of the baseline
control group (group 1) were weighed, anesthetized by co2, and then
euthanized by exsanguination. ten and 2 d before the termination of the
16-wk study, rats received tetracycline (5 mg/rat䡠0.1ml) as a second and
third bone-labeling time point. at the conclusion of the 16-wk treatment
period, bones, serum, and tissues were processed as described above; in
addition, lumbar vertebrae (l1–l2 and l3–l5) were excised and processed for further analysis. tibiae and l1–l2 lumbar vertebrae were

to skeletech for determination of bone mineral density and mechanical
properties.

 xxxd1351xxx  was synthesized based on structure-activity relationships within a series of bicyclic compounds (6-alkylamino1h-quinolin-2-ones) that exhibited ar agonist and antagonist
properties. this compound (6-[bis-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)amino]4-trifluoromethyl-1h-quinolin-2-one) binds ar with high affinity (kd ⫽ 1 nm) (fig. 1, a and b).  xxxd1351xxx  shows no

inducing both transcriptional activation and repression by ar.
 xxxd1351xxx  activity is antagonized by known selective antagonists of ar in vitro and in vivo (data not shown). because of the
negative effect of androgens on prostate size and prostate
cancer, we also tested the activity of  xxxd1351xxx  in a prostate
cancer cell line (22rv1) for activation of the psa promoter (fig.
1e). we transfected a psa/luciferase reporter into 22rv1 cells
and measured activity in response to androgens and the
sarm  xxxd1351xxx . the results indicate that in contrast to the
mmtv and bone cell assays,  xxxd1351xxx  exhibits weak partial
activity in this prostate cancer cell line.
coactivator interactions

to understand the differential activity of  xxxd1351xxx , we
have used a series of peptide-based two-hybrid assays to
analyze the effects of  xxxd1351xxx  on the structure and function

of the ar af2 pocket on the surface of the lbd. these assays
use the gal4 dna-binding domain tethered to small interacting peptides that are capable of binding to ar in the
presence of ligand (31). the  xxxd234xxx  contains an fxxlf
motif derived from the ar n terminus and represents one of
the interaction sites between the ar n terminus and the ar
lbd (23). the steroidal agonists t and  xxxd2136xxx  efficiently induce the interaction of ar and the peptide; however,  xxxd1351xxx  is much weaker, exhibiting greatly reduced
efficacy and potency (fig. 2a). in contrast, a peptide with a
different sequence (d11/f) (31) demonstrated equal efficacy
between the steroids and  xxxd1351xxx  (fig. 2b). as expected,
2-hydroxyflutamide, an ar antagonist, was inactive in both
assays. as shown in fig. 2c,  xxxd1351xxx  was fully capable of
antagonizing the  xxxd2136xxx -induced ar lbd-f-peptide interaction, suggesting that indeed, the peptide was not
able to bind to the ar lbd in the presence of  xxxd1351xxx .

similarly,  xxxd2143xxx  could also antagonize the  xxxd234xxx  interaction with the ar lbd. the same results were obtained
using the full-length n terminus (data not shown). in addition, in another type of coactivation assay, grip-1 (also
known as  xxxg1510xxx ) (39, 40) did not
enhance  xxxd1351xxx -mediated transcription but markedly enhanced steroid-mediated transcription (fig. 2d). this differential interaction was not seen with other coactivators in
similar assays (data not shown).
two-week in vivo study

the strong in vitro efficacy profile in bone and muscle cell
assays as well as the clearly distinct coactivator binding

profile prompted us to test  xxxd1351xxx  in vivo. a 2-wk study
was conducted in young adult rats that were ordx at 8 wk
of age and dosed orally from 1–100 mg/kg䡠d with  xxxd1351xxx 
or t (fig. 3). t was used for this study because it is routinely
used clinically to treat hypogonadism. we have conducted
similar experiments with other orally available steroids ( xxxd2136xxx ) with similar results. in fig. 3, both  xxxd1351xxx 
and t exhibited strong anabolic activity on levator ani muscle
weight that was similar to sham at 3 mg/kg and greater than
sham at higher doses (fig. 3a). high levels of androgen
typically results in increased growth of the prostate. however, in contrast to the results with the muscle endpoint,
 xxxd1351xxx  produced considerably less prostate growth at all

doses when compared with t. prostate weight reached levels
comparable to the intact animals only at 100 mg/kg䡠d (fig.

a large difference in potency and efficacy is also observed
when the effect of  xxxd1351xxx  is compared with the effect of t
on lh suppression (fig. 3c). note that this graph is expressed as percent efficacy relative to sham; thus, high efficacy equals high (sham-like) lh suppression in this case.
 xxxd1351xxx  also suppressed seminal vesicle growth less efficiently than t (data not shown). these results suggest that
 xxxd1351xxx  is capable of strongly enhancing the development
of muscle without excessively stimulating the prostate and
the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.

young growing ordx rats with oral doses of 1, 3, or 10
mg/kg䡠d  xxxd1351xxx  for 6 wk, we detected similar activity on
lh and similar selectivity of muscle vs. prostate size compared with animals treated with  xxxd2136xxx  at 100
mg/kg (fig. 4, a–c). the animals were also examined for the
effects of the treatments on bone structure, strength, and
bone biomarkers. dpd is a collagen cross-link, which is predominantly found in the extracellular matrix of bone or cartilage (41). the urinary excretion of dpd is widely recognized as a valuable marker of bone matrix degradation
during androgen deficiency in male rats (42– 44). dpd levels
were decreased in ordx rats to sham values by  xxxd1351xxx ,
suggesting reduced bone resorption (fig. 4d). to confirm
this activity in the bone itself, we examined tibiae from these
rats directly using histomorphometry. mineral apposition
rate (number of osteoblasts) and bone formation rate (total
osteoblast activity) were calculated based on histomorphometric data from tibiae from these animals. neither castra-

tion nor any dosing treatment of  xxxd1351xxx  had significant
effects on either overall bone density or static or dynamic
measurements in cortical bone (data not shown). in cancellous bone, as expected from earlier work in bone (44, 45) and
from the dpd data, bone formation and mineral apposition
rate were reduced in  xxxd2136xxx  and  xxxd1351xxx -treated
rats (fig. 4, e and f). the reduced bone formation is due to
the direct coupling between bone formation and bone resorption in cancellous bone and indicates a reduction in bone
turnover (44, 45); increased bone turnover with a net increase
in bone resorption is the mechanism for bone loss after
ordx. for both parameters,  xxxd1351xxx  was fully efficacious
at 3 mg/kg, effectively normalizing these parameters with
minimal effect on prostate.
sixteen-week in vivo study

because we were unable to see significant effects of
 xxxd1351xxx  on overall bone density and bone formation in
cortical bone in this 2-month study in immature rats, we
conducted a longer study in skeletally mature ordx rats
dosed orally for 16 wk.  xxxd2136xxx  treatment at 100
mg/kg for this length of time enlarged the livers of the
animals (data not shown). oral steroidal androgens have
been associated with liver toxicity in humans and rodents
(46); however, liver enlargement has not been reported in
humans. no liver enlargement was seen with  xxxd1351xxx   xxxd1891xxx 
mg/kg (data not shown).
at 16 wk after ordx, animals exhibited substantial loss of
bone density, and this loss was prevented by both the steroidal androgen  xxxd2136xxx  and the nonsteroidal androgen  xxxd1351xxx  (fig. 4g). in addition, at the higher doses
of 3 and 10 mg/kg,  xxxd1351xxx  caused frank increases in bone
mineral density above sham levels. the breaking strength
(newtons) and the ultimate breaking strength (newtons per
square millimeter) of  xxxd1351xxx -treated tibae were above
sham at all doses, and 1 mg/kg of  xxxd1351xxx  was equivalent
to 100 mg/kg of  xxxd2136xxx  (fig. 4, h and i).
histomorphometric analysis of cortical bone from the
16-wk study revealed that both the periosteal mineral apposition rate and the periosteal bone formation rate were
significantly enhanced by treatment with  xxxd1351xxx . this anabolic activity of  xxxd1351xxx  was able to prevent bone loss and
maintain bone quality in ordx rats by stimulating bone
formation while simultaneously inhibiting bone resorption
in cancellous bone.

motivation and performance. ejaculation is associated with
performance. copulatory efficiency is an overall performance measure describing the animal’s ability to achieve an
intromission when mounting.
reliably copulating, 6- to 9-month-old male rats were
ordx and implanted with silastic capsules containing lowdose estrogen and treated with vehicle,  xxxd1351xxx , or  xxxd2136xxx . the animals were tested for sexual activity
every 6 –7 d for 8 wk. the number of tests on which a given
rat 1) mounted, 2) intromitted, and 3) ejaculated were determined and expressed in graphical format. vehicle-treated
animals exhibited declines in both motivational and performance indicators during the course of the study. in contrast,
oral dosing of these animals with either  xxxd2136xxx  or
 xxxd1351xxx  significantly enhanced sexual function over vehicle
alone. this included  xxxd1351xxx -mediated increases in
mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations (fig. 5, a–c). the

sex behavior model

in primates and in rats, nonaromatizable androgens act
both on the brain and in the periphery to stimulate male
sexual behavior. in rats, the central effects of nonaromatizable androgens do not occur unless the animals are treated
concurrently with a behaviorally suboptimal priming dose of
estrogen (37, 38). the central and peripheral contributions of
androgens to the activation of male sexual behavior are often
evaluated by subdividing the behavior into motivation and
performance, respectively. mounts, intromissions (insertion
of the penis into the vagina), and ejaculations were scored.
mounting is considered to be the clearest measure of motivation, whereas intromitting is considered a measure of both

sarm also exhibited full efficacy on copulatory efficiency
(fig. 5d) beginning at wk 4.  xxxd1351xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx 
were not significantly different from each other. thus, both
androgens were capable of preventing the loss of motivation
and performance that occurs after castration in this rodent
model.
discussion

steroidal androgens are used in both men and woman for
a large variety of diseases including osteoporosis, frailty,
hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, and others (47). androgens are quite effective because they are anabolic on bone
and muscle and act both centrally and peripherally on sexual
function.
the search for novel androgens that have a desirable efficacy profile coupled with reductions in the common side
effects associated with currently prescribed steroidal androgens is being actively pursued (12–15).
several groups, starting from the known ar antagonists
 xxxd334xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx , have developed a series of injectable compounds that exhibit less effect on prostate while
maintaining effects on muscle or bone (12–20).
we have discovered a structurally distinct class of orally
active nonsteroidal compounds capable of functioning as
sarms. we describe here a member of this class,  xxxd1351xxx ,
that binds competitively to the ar lbd with an affinity in the
nanomolar range. this compound is highly selective for the
ar, with greater than 1000-fold less affinity for any other
nuclear receptor (fig. 1). in contrast to other described injectable molecules with less selectivity,  xxxd1351xxx  is a full
agonist in a number of in vitro efficacy assays and a partial
agonist in a prostate cancer cell psa assay (figs. 1 and 2).
molecular analysis of the coactivator peptide interaction profile of  xxxd1351xxx  revealed significant differences between this
molecule and reference steroids. this differential profile was
generated using a number of peptides capable of binding to
the ar in a ligand-dependent fashion. we discovered that
one peptide derived from the n terminus of ar itself, despite
strong steroid-dependent interactions, was unable to bind
efficiently to ar in the presence of  xxxd1351xxx . this suggested
that in much the same way that selective er modulators alter
the conformation of the af2 coactivator pocket of the er,
 xxxd1351xxx  alters the structure of this area of the ar in subtle
but critical ways such that certain peptides interact with
normal affinity, but the binding of others are significantly
reduced. the n-terminal interaction has been postulated to
play an important role in the regulation of gene expression
by the ar in prostate (23). we tested  xxxd1351xxx  in several
versions of n-c interaction assays and found that the compound exhibited reduced activity. thus, it is likely that when
ar binds  xxxd1351xxx , the n terminus is less tightly bound to
the lbd than when the ar is bound to steroids. in addition,
we have found that the coactivator grip 1 is less able to
coactivate a receptor bound to  xxxd1351xxx  than one bound to
steroidal androgens.
this altered coactivator and n-terminal interaction profile
likely is the result of alterations in the structure of the receptor lbd helix 12 region. x-ray crystallographic analysis
of ar bound to  xxxd1351xxx  is underway and will be published

elsewhere. the functional consequences of this altered coactivator interaction profile were tested in vivo in a rat model
of androgen deficiency. there is controversy on the relative
contribution of ar vs. er to bone structure and function,
because of the conversion of t to estrogen. neither  xxxd2136xxx  nor  xxxd1351xxx  is subject to aromatization to estrogen;
thus our experiments address this issue directly by testing
the effects of both nonaromatizable androgens on critical
parameters of bone formation, resorption, and strength in
ordx rats as well as other endpoints.
we conducted a 2-wk study in ordx rats with t or
 xxxd1351xxx  and examined several parameters. we demonstrated significant changes in lh. this critical steroidogenic
hormone is under tight negative feedback control by t, and
ordx resulted in the expected rise in serum lh. this increase was entirely and potently prevented by the control
steroid and by  xxxd1351xxx  (fig. 3a). muscle weight from these
treated animals increased dramatically in response to
 xxxd1351xxx  and the steroid, consistent with the role of androgens in maintaining and enhancing muscle growth. at the
same dose that  xxxd1351xxx  was powerfully anabolic to muscle,
prostate growth was limited, not reaching eugonadal levels
even  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg (fig. 3, b and c). this separation in desired
efficacy and side effect suggests that this molecule could
have beneficial effects in patients in need of the anabolic
effects of androgens while avoiding the stimulatory effects
on prostate.
the effects on muscle notwithstanding, a critical component of any sarm must be its activity on bone. as expected,
after 6 wk of dosing with vehicle, ordx animals increased
bone resorption either because of the decreased activity of the
ar in response to endogenous t and dht or because of the
decreased activation by the er in response to decreased
estrogen from aromatized t. after dosing for 6 wk with the
nonaromatizable, orally available androgen  xxxd2136xxx  and with  xxxd1351xxx , organ weights and hormone measurements changed significantly for lh (fig. 4a), levator ani
(fig. 4b), and prostate (fig. 4c), but the tissue selectivity
noted in the 2-wk study remained. note that  xxxd2136xxx  is less potent on the organ endpoints than t. in addition,
both compounds efficiently blocked the bone resorption
marker dpd (fig. 4d). examination of the cancellous bone by
histomorphometry corroborated the marker data. castration
increased both bone formation rate and mineral apposition
rate, and androgen treatment decreased these endpoints (fig.
4, e and f). this androgen-driven decrease in bone formation
rate occurs because of the linkage between resorption and
formation of new bone in the cancellous compartment (48).
androgens decrease resorption in cancellous bone on which
bone formation depends, and so formation drops as well.
thus, by multiple measures, androgens that act solely
through the ar are capable of inhibiting bone resorption in
cancellous bone. this result indicates that it is possible for
androgens to mediate similar effects as estrogens in the cancellous compartment, suggesting that therapy with androgens would at least mimic the antiresorptive activity of estrogens and bisphosphonates. in contrast, in rat cortical bone,
there is very little bone resorption, providing an ideal environment to measure anabolic effects on bone formation di-

rectly. it is known that estrogen actually inhibits bone formation in cortical bone (32).
to measure bone formation in the cortical compartment,
we conducted an extended study of 16 wk of oral dosing with
 xxxd1351xxx  followed by structural and histomorphometric
analysis of bones from treated and control animals. bone
mineral density was significantly affected by both castration
and treatment with the androgenic compounds.  xxxd2136xxx  and  xxxd1351xxx  fully maintained bone density, and
 xxxd1351xxx  at 3 and 10 mg/kg actually increased bone density
above eugonadal levels (fig. 4g). this change in density was
accompanied by a change in breaking strength of the bone
that was well above eugonadal for all doses of  xxxd1351xxx  (fig.
4, h and i). thus, this sarm not only increased the amount
of bone present but also significantly enhanced the strength
of that bone. one explanation for this activity is that the
compound may be enhancing the rate of bone formation in
the periosteum. using histomorphometry on cortical bone
samples, we established that  xxxd1351xxx  is capable of enhancing both the mineral apposition rate and the bone formation
rate in castrated animals. neither the steroid  xxxd2136xxx  nor  xxxd1351xxx  was able to fully maintain the rate of bone
formation compared with sham, suggesting other testes components may also be important. this beneficial effect of androgens on cortical bone is not a consequence of aromatization to estrogen for two reasons: 1) estrogen in this model
is actually inhibitory to cortical bone formation and mineral
apposition rate (49) and 2)  xxxd1351xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx 
are both active on building bone and neither one is aromatizable. thus the benefits generated by these compounds are
due to the activation of the ar likely acting directly on
osteoblasts. other well characterized antiresorptive agents
such as bisphosphonates (50) and estrogen are incapable of
this type of activity. only true anabolic agents such as steroidal androgens or pth (51) build bone strength and mass
by enhancing the action of osteoblasts. these results demonstrate that  xxxd1351xxx  exhibits a highly beneficial profile on
bone, with both antiresorptive, and, significantly, anabolic
bone effects.
there are initial reports of nongenomic effects of androgens on bone (36), which are hypothesized to play a role in
mediating the effects of androgens. we know that  xxxd1351xxx 
strongly activates and represses classical androgen-responsive genes through genomic mechanisms, but we have no
data on the activity of  xxxd1351xxx  on potential nongenomic
effects.
the role of androgens in libido and sexual function is well
established for both males and females (4). declines in androgen levels can affect multiple aspects of sexual activity in
patients. supplemental topical androgens have provided
benefit in a number of clinical trials (52, 53), but their use is
confounded by prostate-related side effects in men and androgenic side effects in women as well as skin irritation at the
site of application in both sexes.
 xxxd1351xxx  was tested for activity in a sexual behavior
model in rats along with the nonaromatizable androgen  xxxd2136xxx  as a positive control. in this model, the response of male rats to the presence of a sexually receptive
female is examined. castrated males were tested for their
receptiveness to females by monitoring behavioral re-

sponses. dosing castrated animals (on a low-priming-dose
estrogen) with either  xxxd2136xxx  or the sarm
 xxxd1351xxx  resulted in an improvement in measures of both
performance and motivation, including mounts, intromissions, ejaculations, and copulatory efficiency compared with
vehicle (fig. 5).
thus,  xxxd1351xxx  is a highly active androgen, capable of
anabolic activity on both bone and muscle. in addition,
 xxxd1351xxx  exhibits a safer profile on prostate growth and is
able to enhance sexual function and motivation. this beneficial profile is likely the result of alterations in the conformation of the lbd of the ar when it binds to  xxxd1351xxx . this
compound is an orally available sarm, the prototype of a
series of molecules that may provide patients with additional
bone, muscle, and quality of life enhancement with fewer of
the side effects produced by current therapies.
