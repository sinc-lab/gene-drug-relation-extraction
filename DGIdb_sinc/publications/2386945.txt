the plating medium was replaced three times at 6-8-h intervals with
fresh 3-ml aliquots of phenol red-free dmem plus 2% stripped cs, 2
mm glutamine, and 50 mg/ml gentamicin. drug, estradiol, or the
appropriate solvent controls were added to the flasks after a total of 24
h in steroid-free medium. on the days indicated, cells in the medium
and those harvested from the monolayer by trypsinization were pooled,
pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 min, and resuspended in 1
ml of hbss. single cell suspensions were made by passing the cells
through a 20-gauge needle. cell counts were performed using a hemacytometer in the presence of 0.06% trypan blue to assess viability.

and/or hormones were added to the cells following the final medium
replacement on day 4. eighteen to 24 h later, cells were incubated at
37â°cfor l h with 0.5 â¿ici/wellof ['h-methyl]thymidine (85 ci/mmol;

trichloroacetic acid precipitates, as detailed previously (27).
flow cytometry. cells were replica plated (4 x 10*/60-mm: dish) on
day 1 in 3 ml of phenol red-free dmem plus 2% stripped cs. medium
replacements and drug/hormone additions were performed according
to the schedule used in the ['hjthymidine incorporation assays. cells
were harvested and counted after 24 or 72 h of drug and/or hormone
exposure. nuclei were prepared and stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
according to the method of vindel0v (28), except that nuclei were
treated with trypsin (0.03 mg/ml) for 25 min at 37â°cbefore proceeding
with the ribonuclease and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining steps. the pro

100,000 x g for 40 min. progesterone receptors in the resulting cytosol
were measured using a competitive binding assay (32). a single satu
rating concentration of ['hjr5020 (20 nim)in the absence and presence
of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled r5020 was used. both competed and
uncompeted tubes contained a final concentration of 100 n\i hydrocor

inhibition of breast cancer growth

where /b = fractional drug response (table 1). there is close
agreement between the kt determined by [3h]thymidine incor
poration assays following acute drug exposure (18-24 h) and
cell number data obtained following a 5-day drug exposure.
under all conditions tested,  xxxd2956xxx  was twice as potent as
thioridazine in the inhibition of mcf-7 cell proliferation in
vitro. in preliminary studies (data not shown), the potencies of
 xxxd3431xxx  and fluphenazine were found to be equivalent
to that of thioridazine in the inhibition of mcf-7 cell growth.
 xxxd2956xxx  inhibition of estradiol-induced [3h]thymidine in
corporation into mcf-7 cells was not overcome by increasing
the concentration of estradiol to 250 nm.  xxxd2956xxx  (2.5 um)
inhibited [3h]thymidine incorporation by 56% in cells exposed
to 2.5 nm estradiol and by 61% in cells exposed to 250 nm
estradiol. therefore, competition with estradiol for er
binding sites or an increased rate of estradiol metabolism to
less active metabolites is unlikely to account for the growthinhibitory actions of  xxxd2956xxx . analogous studies with thiori
dazine were not performed; however, the interactions of both
 xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine with er were further explored.
effects of  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine on the mcf-7 estrogen
and progesterone receptors.  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine failed
to compete with [3h]estradiol for mcf-7 er binding sites at
drug concentrations that antagonized the growth of mcf-7
cells (fig. 2). competition between unlabeled estradiol and
[3h]estradiol for er binding is shown as a control. changes in

long-term exposure to  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine were also
examined. whole cell er binding assays were performed after
exposure of mcf-7 cells to  xxxd2956xxx  (1 /â¿m)
or the appropriate
solvent (0.1%  xxxd1896xxx ) for 4 h, 24 h, or 5 days.
scatchard plot analyses of the binding data were used to esti
mate the number of  xxxg730xxx  sites per cell and their
affinity for estradiol. the binding data are summarized in table
2 and indicate that neither  xxxg730xxx  number nor affin
ity for estradiol was reduced by chronic exposure of mcf-7
cells to  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine.
finally, the biological activity of the  xxxg730xxx  in
 xxxd2956xxx -treated mcf-7 cells was demonstrated by its nuclear
localization and its ability to induce cytosolic progesterone
receptors (table 3). estrogen receptors in estrogen-deprived
and estradiol-treated cells were localized primarily within the
nucleus. levels of cytosolic estrogen receptors in these same
cells were less than 10% of the nuclear levels (data not shown).
 xxxd2956xxx  treatment did not reduce levels of nuclear er or
increase levels of cytosolic er.
pgr were undetectable in mcf-7 cells grown in the complete
absence of estrogen for 10 days. induction of pgr by treatment
with 2.5 nm estradiol for 72 h occurred in both the absence and
the presence of 2.5 mm  xxxd2956xxx . these data suggest that
 xxxd2956xxx  interferes with the process of estrogen-induced growth
in mcf-7 cells via a mechanism that is distinct from that
involved in the induction of progesterone receptors.
effects of  xxxd2956xxx  on mcf-7 cell cycle. to determine the
influence of  xxxd2956xxx  on progression of mcf-7 cells through
the cell cycle, mcf-7 cells were treated for 24 or 72 h with
estradiol,  xxxd2956xxx , or estradiol plus  xxxd2956xxx  (fig. 3). pimo
zide treatment resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent
decrease in the percentage of cells in s phase. prolonged ex
posure to  xxxd2956xxx  resulted in a gradual accumulation of cells
in gã¬/co.this effect was concentration dependent and most
marked in the estradiol-treated cells that were traversing the
cell cycle most rapidly. mcf-7 cells exposed to high concentra
tions of  xxxd2956xxx  (10 mm)in the absence of estradiol showed
some accumulation in g2-m, an effect that is sometimes indic
ative of cytotoxicity (33). cell viability was monitored through
out these experiments by trypan blue exclusion, which corrob
orated this observation. at 24 h, cell viability exceeded 90% in
all cells exposed to 0 or 2.5 mmpimozide and 85% in cells
exposed to 5 or 10 mm  xxxd2956xxx . by 72 h, cell viability in
untreated cells was 88%, but it decreased to approximately 65
and 48% in cells treated with 5 or 10 mmpimozide, respectively.
we conclude that a delay in the gi/g0 to s phase transition
plays a role in the inhibition of mcf-7 cell growth by concen
trations of  xxxd2956xxx  <5 mmand that higher concentrations of
 xxxd2956xxx  are cytotoxic.

calmodulin antagonism is likely to play a role in the mech
anism of the antiproliferative action of  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine. our experiments with  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine are con
sistent with earlier studies showing inhibition of the growth of
mcf-7 (10, 35, 36) and other tumor cells in tissue culture (59) by compounds with calmodulin antagonist activity. concen
trations of  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine that block breast cancer
cell growth are similar to drug concentrations that have been
shown to inhibit calmodulin-dependent enzyme activation (34).
furthermore, our results with the naphthalenesulfonamides
w-13 and w-12 provide specific evidence for the role of cal
modulin in the control of mcf-7 breast cancer cell growth
in vitro.
 xxxd2956xxx  is the most potent calmodulin antagonist among
the neuroleptic drugs currently approved for clinical use (34);
thus, we have focused our efforts on this compound.  xxxd2956xxx 
was shown to inhibit proliferation of one er-negative and three
er-positive human breast cancer cell lines. in mcf-7 cells,
 xxxd2956xxx  was shown to block estradiol-induced growth inde
pendently of effects on the er and to inhibit proliferation in
response to three polypeptide hormones, insulin,  xxxg1144xxx , and
egf.
a variety of compounds possessing anticalmodulin activity
induce similar alterations in cell cycle kinetics. inhibition of
mcf-7 cell growth by r24571, tamoxifen, and  xxxd2956xxx  is
accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells in s phase
and a concomitant increase in the number of cells in g|/g0
(36, 37). sutherland and colleagues (36) have presented evi
dence that the actions of tamoxifen and the calmodulin antag
onist r24571 are specifically directed to an event early in the
gã¬phase of the mcf-7 cell cycle. these pharmacological data
are consistent with a mechanism of action involving a delay in
the progression of cells through gi, and, consistent with this
hypothesis, rasmussen and means (38) have shown that bio
chemically elevated intracellular calmodulin concentrations
enhance the progression of mouse c127 cells through the g,
phase of the cell cycle. the nature of the calmodulin-sensitive
event(s) in gã¬is of considerable interest, as this could serve as
an important target for chemotherapeutic intervention of tumor
cell growth.
in light of the evidence that  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine have
calmodulin antagonist activity, it is interesting that no adverse
effects on the ability of the mcf-7 er to bind [3h]estradiol or

â¡torof proliferation in both the er-negative and er-positive
cell lines (data not shown).

by two relatively selective calmodulin antagonists, w-13 and to function in the induction of pgr were observed in our studies.

the specific uptake of ['hjestradiol and decrease the number of

measurable [3h]estradiol-receptor binding complexes in whole
esses. the results in fig. 5 show that there is a close correlation
between the inhibition of mcf-7 cell numbers after a 5-day cell binding assays (41). these effects disappeared 3 h after
exposure to w-13 and inhibition of [3h]thymidine incorpora

inhibition of breast cancer growth

failed to compete with estradiol for mcf-7 cytosol er binding
sites.
in addition to calmodulin antagonism,  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine have multiple cellular actions that may contribute to
their antiproliferative effects.  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine block
calcium entry through plasma membrane calcium channels in
tissues such as brain, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and
pituitary cells (43-46). although the role of calcium in mcf-7
cell proliferation is not known, a preliminary characterization
of calcium channels in mcf-7 cells has been reported (47).
 xxxd2956xxx  has also been shown to inhibit protein kinase c
activity (48). although down-regulation of protein kinase c in
mcf-7 cells by  xxxd2925xxx 
results
in growth stimulation (49), not inhibition, other protein kinases
may be important in mcf-7 cell growth regulation. for ex
ample, elevations in c-myc mrna levels are associated with
estradiol-induced growth in mcf-7 cells (50), and phosphorylation of the wye-encoded protein by casein kinase ii has been
implicated in the transduction of the mitogenic stimuli of
insulin,  xxxg1144xxx , and egf to the nucleus (51-53).
 xxxd2956xxx  is a neuroleptic that is approved for use in the
control of a neurological disorder called tourette's disease (54).
thioridazine is a neuroleptic drug that is used to control
schizophrenia and other psychoses (54). the demonstration
that  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine inhibit the growth of human
breast cancer cell lines in tissue culture is evidence that alter
native strategies for control of breast cancer proliferation in
vivo may be found among existing drugs that have not tradi
tionally been considered anticancer agents and provides a ra
tional basis for the experimental use of  xxxd2956xxx  in vivo to
block estrogen- and polypeptide hormone-stimulated
breast
cancer growth. significantly, concentrations of  xxxd2956xxx  and
thioridazine that inhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro are
achieved in patients receiving these drugs (43, 55) without the
cytotoxic effects associated with standard chemotherapeutic
regimens. control of breast tumor growth in vivo by  xxxd2956xxx 
and thioridazine administration would therefore offer obvious
advantages. some adverse side effects attributable to the antidopaminergic activity of these drugs to occur in vivo (54).
however, the incidence of parkinson-like symptoms and tardive
dyskinesia with long-term administration of thioridazine is less
than observed with other phenothiazines. elevations in serum
prolactin are common in patients receiving all neuroleptic
drugs. although the data implicating prolactin in human breast
tumor growth are equivocal (56, 57), prolactin receptors have
been identified in 40% of human breast tumors (58). the
potential for stimulation of breast tumor growth in vivo by
 xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine is of concern and could affect the
clinical usefulness of  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine in breast cancer
treatment. the concurrent use of a prolactin-lowering drug
such as  xxxd372xxx  (59) in patients with prolactin receptorpositive tumors may suffice to control prolactin-stimulated
tumor growth. we conclude that  xxxd2956xxx  and thioridazine are
possible candidates for further development for use in human
breast cancer treatment.
