 xxxd3417xxx  inhibition of il-1-induced il-6 production by human lung fibroblasts.  il-6 is a multi-functional cytokine that plays an important role in normal biologic homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. retinoids are  xxxd3105xxx  analogs that regulate the function of a wide variety of inflammatory and structural cells. to further understand the biology of retinoids and il-6 we determined whether all-trans- xxxd3417xxx  (ra) and other retinoids regulate lung fibroblast il-6 production. ra did not stimulate fibroblast il-6 production. instead, it inhibited the production of il-6 by il-1-stimulated cells. this effect was dose-dependent with an ic50 of 10(-7) m ra and significant inhibition being noted with doses of ra as low as 10(-8) m. these inhibitory effects could not be explained by cytotoxicity or a shift in the kinetics of il-6 production. they also did not appear to involve alterations in the early events in il-1-induced il-6 production, because ra inhibited il-6 production even when added 6 h after il-1 and ra did not inhibit il-1 binding to cell surface il-1 receptors. ra inhibition of il-6 protein production was associated with a comparable decrease in il-6 mrna accumulation and gene transcription. 13-cis- xxxd3417xxx , retinol, retinaldehyde, all-trans  xxxd71xxx , ro 13-6298, and 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  also inhibited il-1-induced il-6 production. however, 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide and  xxxd2071xxx  did not share this property. the inhibitory effects of these analogues may be mediated by nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors as mrna encoding  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1933xxx , and rxr-alpha were present, and  xxxg1932xxx  was induced by ra in human lung fibroblasts. these studies demonstrate that ra and other retinoid analogs inhibit il-1-induced il-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at least partially, transcriptionally mediated.
