abstract
background: the use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure.
hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( xxxg1048xxx ) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. however,
the expression of  xxxg1048xxx  in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with
beta-blocker is little known.
methods and results: to test the hypothesis that  xxxg1048xxx  plays a role in the failing myocardium because
of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult sprague-dawley rats to
induce volume-overload heart failure. carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was
given. the heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 ⫾ 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 ⫾ 0.7
(p ⬍ .001) in the shunt group. left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 ⫾ 0.5 mm to
8.7 ⫾ 0.6 mm (p ⬍ .001). treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and
ventricular dimension to the baseline values. western blot showed that  xxxg1048xxx , vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf), and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) proteins were upregulated and  xxxg1564xxx -beta
(ngf-beta) downregulated in the shunt group. real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mrna of
 xxxg1048xxx , vegf, and bnp increased and mrna of ngf-beta decreased in the shunt group. treatment with
carvedilol reversed both protein and mrna of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, bnp, and ngf-beta to the baseline values.
increased immunohistochemical labeling of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, and bnp in the ventricular myocardium
was observed in the shunt group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling.
conclusion:  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf mrna and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of
volume-overload heart failure. treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation
of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf in the failing ventricular myocardium.
key words: beta-blocker, congestive heart failure, gene expression, growth factor.

as a substrate for beta-oxidation.1,2 in the mechanism of the activation of glycolysis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( xxxg1048xxx )
is known to be involved in the increased expression
of glycolytic enzymes.3,4 in the progression of heart failure,
in which impaired energy metabolism may occur, hif1alpha is likely to be involved in the activation of the glycolytic
system.  xxxg1048xxx  has been shown to early express in ischemic myocardium in patients with myocardial infarction5
and in animal model of coronary artery ligation.6
in addition to the hypoxic pathway mediating  xxxg1048xxx 
expression, other, nonhypoxic pathways factors such as neurohormonal activators and mechanical stress have also been
shown to induce  xxxg1048xxx  expression in vascular smooth
cells.7,8 recently kim et al9 demonstrated that acute hemodynamic overload induced  xxxg1048xxx  and vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) expression in rat myocardium.

congestive heart failure is an important cause of death in
human. how to prevent and treat heart failure is a critical issue
in medicine. in heart failure, key enzymes in beta-oxidation
are downregulated, with impaired incorporation of fatty acid

hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and heart failure

 xxxg1048xxx  and vegf were upregulated in a mouse model of
dilated cardiomyopathy caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.10 the expression of  xxxg1048xxx  in chronic heart failure
resulting from volume overload is little known. we hypothesized that  xxxg1048xxx  plays a role in the failing myocardium
because of volume overload. the use of beta-blockers has
emerged as a beneficial treatment in patients with congestive
heart failure.11–13 although expression of other genes such
as serca have been extensively examined in heart failure
treated with beta-blocker, much less is known about  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf.14–16 moreover, the link of protein expression to
beta-blocker treatment in congestive heart failure is largely
unknown. accordingly, we sought to investigate the gene
and protein expression of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf in a rat model
of volume-overload heart failure caused by aorta-caval shunt
and to evaluate the effect of carvedilol on both genes and
proteins expression in this model of heart failure.
methods
rat model of aorta-caval shunt
on the day of surgery, the sprague-dawley rats weighing 280
to 330 g were anesthetized with ether and the vena cava and
aorta were exposed via abdominal midline incision. the aorta
was punctured at the union of the segment two-thirds caudal to
the left renal artery and one-third cephalic to the aortic bifurcation,
with an 18 gauge disposable needle held with a plastic syringe.
the needle was advanced into the aorta, perforating its adjacent
wall and penetrating the vena cava. a bulldog vascular clamp was
then placed across the aorta caudal to the left renal artery. after the
aorta was clamped, the needle was fully withdrawn and the hole at
the aorta was sutured. the clamp was then removed. the patency
of the shunt was verified visually by a swelling vena cava and the
mixture of arterial and venous blood. the induced aorta-caval shunt
eventually caused a ratio of 1.7 of pulmonary flow to systemic
flow. sham-operated control animals were prepared in a similar
manner, except that the aorta was not punctured. after the procedure, the abdominal wound was sutured and the rats were allowed
to recover. in the experimental group, the rat was given 50 mg/kg
body weight per day of carvedilol in drinking water after surgery
for 4 weeks. the animals were randomly assigned to experimental
or sham groups. the perioperative mortality in the shunt group

was around 10%. all animal procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guideline and conformed with the guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals as published by the us
national institutes of health.
hemodynamic monitor
four weeks after the surgery, the animals were anesthetized with
pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg) and their carotid arteries were
cannulated with polyethylene catheters to measure mean arterial
pressure. heart rate was measured through a grass model tachograph preamplifier. after the measurement of hemodynamic data,
the rats were sacrificed to remove the heart to perform the following experiments.
assessment of cardiac dilatation and function
cardiac function of aorta-caval shunting rat was evaluated noninvasively by echocardiography performed with an acuson (siemens
medical solutions, mountain view, california) sequoia 512 machine using a 15-mhz probe at the day of sacrifice, 4 weeks
after surgery. left ventricular percent fractional shortening, left
ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and interventricular septum
thickness were calculated.
western blot analysis
tissue samples from left ventricle were homogenized in modified ripa buffer (50 mmol/l tris [ph 7.4], 1% igepal ca630 (sigma, st. louis, missouri), 0.25% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 150
mmol/l nacl, 1 mmol/l edta, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and 1 µg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). nuclear
and cytosolic protein samples were mixed with sample buffer, boiled
for 10 minutes, separated by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and
electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. the nitrocellulose
membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer, incubated with  xxxd328xxx , or anti– xxxg1048xxx , anti–brain natriuretic peptide (bnp), or anti– xxxg1564xxx  (ngf)-beta antibody, washed,
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody. signals were visualized by chemiluminescent detection.
rna isolation and reverse transcription
total rna was isolated from frozen left ventricle using the
single-step acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method. total rna (1 µg) was incubated with 200 u of

results
hemodynamic and echocardiographic change after
shunting and treatment with carvedilol

the surgical aorta-caval shunt significantly increased the
heart weight and the ratio of heart weight and body weight
at 4 weeks, as shown in table 1. the heart weight increased
significantly from 803 ⫾ 50 mg in the sham group to 1203 ⫾
95 mg in the shunt group (p ⬍ .001). heart rate increased
significantly after induction of shunting for 4 weeks from
311 ⫾ 8 beats/min in the sham group to 361 ⫾ 25 beats/min
(p ⬍ .001) in the shunt group. mean arterial pressure decreased from 89 ⫾ 19 mm hg in the sham group to 56 ⫾
10 mm hg (p ⬍ .001) in the shunt group. the aorta-caval
shunt also increased left ventricular end-diastolic and endsystolic dimensions, but maintained the left ventricular
fraction shortening. these findings indicated that our aortacaval shunt induced volume-overload heart failure. treatment with carvedilol significantly reduced the heart weight
and the ratio of heart weight and body weight. the heart
weight in the shunt group decreased to 788 ⫾ 35 mg after
treatment of carvedilol for 4 weeks. mean arterial pressure
also increased after treatment with carvedilol. the increased
left ventricular dimension was reversed to normal by carvedilol. the fractional shortening did not improve with carvedilol
treatment because the reduction of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (from 8.7 ⫾ 0.6 mm to 6.5 ⫾ 0.2 mm) is
greater than that of left ventricular end-systolic dimension
(4.3 ⫾ 0.7 mm to 3.4 ⫾ 0.6 mm). the fraction shortening
showed no statistical difference between control group and
carvedilol treatment group. treatment with carvedilol in the
shunt and sham groups significantly decreased heart rate as
compared with both groups without treatment. the serum
levels of  xxxg99xxx  measured by immunoassay for sham,
shunt group without treatment, and shunt group treated with
carvedilol were 55 ⫾ 8 pg/ml, 180 ⫾ 10 pg/ml, and 50 ⫾
8 pg/ml (p ⬍ .01, n ⫽ 3 per group), respectively. the serum
levels of  xxxg674xxx  also increased in the shunt group and
decreased to the control value after treatment with carvedilol
for 4 weeks (data not shown).

1alpha ( xxxg1048xxx ),  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf), nerve
growth factor-beta (ngf-beta), and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) after
induction of aorta-caval shunt for 6 weeks with or without treatment
with carvedilol. similar results were observed in another 2 independent experiments.

to evaluate the effect of aorta-caval shunt and carvedilol
on the  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf protein expression, western blotting was performed. the  xxxg1048xxx  protein increased 2.3-fold
at 4 weeks of induction of aorta-caval shunt as compared with
the sham group (p ⬍ .001). vegf protein also increased
slightly but significantly (p ⬍ .01) at 4 weeks of induction of
aorta-caval shunt as compared with the sham group (fig. 1).
treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group significantly
blocked the increase of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf proteins induced
by aorta-caval shunt. aorta-caval shunt significantly increased bnp protein expression (1.8-fold, p ⬍ .01 versus

sham group) and decreased ngf-beta protein expression (0.7fold, p ⬍ .05 versus sham group). treatment with carvedilol
in the shunt group reversed the bnp and ngf-beta protein
expression to the baseline levels. treatment with carvedilol
in the sham group did not affect the protein expression of
 xxxg1048xxx , vegf, bnp, and ngf-beta. we extended the study
of the aorta-cava shunt to a longer duration of 6 weeks. as
shown in fig. 2,  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf protein expression still
increased significantly in the shunt group without treatment
and reversed to normal value after treatment of carvedilol
for 6 weeks. the pattern of bnp and ngf-beta protein expression in the 6-week duration of aorta-caval shunt was similar
to that in the 4-week duration.
expression of mrna by real-time pcr after
shunting and treatment with carvedilol

we used real-time pcr to evaluate the effect of aortacaval shunt and carvedilol on the  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf mrna
levels. as shown in fig. 3,  xxxg1048xxx  mrna increased 1.8fold at 4 weeks of induction of aorta-caval shunt as compared
with the sham group (p ⬍ .001). vegf mrna also increased 2.2-fold at 4 weeks of induction of aorta-caval shunt

as compared with the sham group (p ⬍ .001). treatment with
carvedilol in the shunt group significantly inhibited the
increase of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf mrna-induced by aortacaval shunt. as shown in fig. 4, aorta-caval shunt significantly increased bnp mrna expression (1.5-fold, p ⬍ .01
versus sham group) and decreased ngf-beta mrna expression
(0.7-fold, p ⬍ .05 versus sham group). treatment with
carvedilol in the shunt group completely blocked the increase
of bnp and ngf-beta mrna expression-induced by shunting.
treatment with carvedilol in the sham group did not affect
the mrna expression of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, bnp, and ngfbeta. treatment with  xxxd3487xxx  at 25 mg/kg in the shunt group
for 4 weeks did not reverse the  xxxg1048xxx  (1.6 ⫾ 0.2 fold
versus sham group) and vegf (2.1 ⫾ 0.2 fold versus sham
group) mrna expression as compared with the shunt group
without treatment.
increased immunohistochemical labeling of  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf after aorta-caval shunt

immunohistochemical stain confirmed the previous
findings from western blots and real-time pcr. increased
labeling of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf and bnp in the ventricular myocardium was observed after induction of aorta-caval shunt for

decreased the immunohistochemical labeling of  xxxg1048xxx ,

of ngf-beta in the ventricular myocardium was observed after
induction of aorta-caval shunt for 4 weeks. treatment with
carvedilol in the shunt group increased the immunohistochemical labeling of ngf-beta. treatment with carvedilol in
the sham group did not affect the immunohistochemical
labeling of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, bnp, and ngf-beta (data not

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that both  xxxg1048xxx  and
vegf mrna and protein expression were upregulated in
a rat model of chronic volume-overload heart failure. the
model of heart failure was confirmed by morphologic and
gene profile study. after induction of aorta-caval shunt for
4 weeks, heart weight, heart rate, and left ventricular dimensions increased. the hemodynamic data presented certainly
support a volume-overload state. cardiac bnp and ngf-beta
mrna and protein expression were measured to confirm

the presence of heart failure. cardiac bnp gene expression
is specifically induced in states of severe heart failure,17
whereas ngf-beta is downregulated in heart failure.18,19 the
elevated cardiac bnp and decreased cardiac ngf-beta in our
study were consistent with previous studies and support the
presence of heart failure.
use of beta-blocker to treat patients with congestive heart
failure is beneficial. the functional recovery resulting from
beta-blocker therapy has been shown to restore the unfavorable
gene expression that control ca2⫹ handling in the failing
heart.15,16 whether beta-blocker therapy can alter  xxxg1048xxx , a
major physiologic regulator of many genes, in myocardium
is not known in congestive heart failure. change gene expression after beta-blocker therapy in human was obtained from
right ventricle.15,16 gene expression of the left ventricle is
not necessarily the same as in the right ventricle.
the vegf expression in heart failure is controversial.
tham et al10 reported upregulation of  xxxg2413xxx  without angiogenesis in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy caused

patients with congestive heart failure, the blood levels of
vegf were also inconsistent.21,22 in these studies,  xxxg1048xxx 
was not studied.  xxxg1048xxx  is a key physiologic regulator of
gene expression that responds to changes in cellular oxygen
tension. recent studies suggest that  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and
protein can be induced under normoxic conditions by growth
factors and hormones in vascular smooth muscle cells7,8 and
by mechanical stress in rat myocardium.9 in this study, we
demonstrated that  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and protein expression
was upregulated in a volume-overload heart failure. the
increase in  xxxg1048xxx  protein will increase its target gene,
vegf expression.
tissue ischemia has been reported in congestive heart
failure,23 possibly because of a combination of increased

wall stress and coronary vasoconstriction and endothelial
dysfunction. neurohormonal and mechanical factors have
been shown to induce  xxxg1048xxx  expression.7,8 in the model of
volume-overload congestive heart failure, the left ventricle is
stretched by the enlarged chamber and cytokine released
because of neurohormonal activation. accordingly,  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf were upregulated in the volume-overload heart
failure. treatment with beta-blocker has been shown to decrease
cytokine expression after myocardial infarction in rats.24
myocardial tissue ischemia can be reduced after treatment
with beta-blocker. therefore, the upregulated  xxxg1048xxx  and
vegf mrna and protein expression were reversed to the
baseline levels without heart failure. our study presented
for the first time that carvedilol modulated the expression

hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and heart failure

of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf in a model of volume-overload heart
failure. carvedilol is a nonselective, vasodilating beta-blocker
with potent antioxidant and free radical-scavenging properties that is used in the treatment of hypertension, angina,
and congestive heart failure.25 in our study, we did not demonstrate whether it is the beta-blocking effect of carvedilol that
is altering gene expression or some of other mechanisms of
action of carvedilol.  xxxd3487xxx , an  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonist, did not reverse gene expression abnormalities
in our study. this finding may indicate that the effect seen on
 xxxg1048xxx  and vegf gene expression in the volume-overload
model is specific to carvedilol.
reducing heart rate has been reported to increase myocardial vegf production.26 in our study, carvedilol reduced
heart rate both in the treated sham and shunt groups. however, vegf and  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and protein expression in
the treated sham group were similar to that in the sham
group without treatment. this finding indicated that the
upregulation of vegf and  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and protein expression in the volume-overload heart failure was not the
result of bradycardia effect. however, we cannot exclude
the possibility that hemodynamic change after carvedilol
treatment may alter the  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf expression in
our study.
in summary, we demonstrated that  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf
mrna and protein expression were upregulated in a rat
model of volume-overload heart failure induced by aortacaval shunt. treatment with carvedilol results in a reversal
of cardiac remodeling and abnormal expression of  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf in this model of heart failure.
