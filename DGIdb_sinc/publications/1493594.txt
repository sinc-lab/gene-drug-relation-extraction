the objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that the diabetes-induced reduction in  xxxg1337xxx  activity
in cardiac myocytes may be due to hypertriglyceridemia. administration of 4-aminopyrazolopyrimiqine(50 mg/kg) to control
rats for 24 h reduced plasma triacylglycerol levels and increased the heparin-induced release of  xxxg1337xxx  into the
incubation medium of cardiac myocytes. the acute (3 -5 days) induction of diabetes by  xxxd3249xxx  (100 mglkg) produced
hypertriglyceridemia and reduced heparin-releasable  xxxg1337xxx  activity in cardiac myocytes. treatment of diabetic
rats with 4-arninopyrazolopyrimidine resulted in a fall in plasma triacylglycerol content and increased heparin-releasable
 xxxg1337xxx  activity. administration of  xxxd3458xxx  also resulted in hypertriglyceridemia, but the heparin-induced
release of lipoprotein iipase from control cardiac myocytes was not reduced in the absence of lipolysis of triacylglycerol-rich
lipoproteins. treatment with  xxxd3458xxx  did, however, increase the heparin-induced release of  xxxg1337xxx  from
diabetic cardiac myocytes. preparation of cardiac rnyocytes with 0.9 mm  xxxd2777xxx  resulted in a decrease in both total cellular
and heparin-releasable  xxxg1337xxx  activities. these results suggest that the diabetes-induced reduction in heart
 xxxg1337xxx  activity may, at least in part, be due to an inhibitory effect of free  xxxd2154xxx , derived either from lipoprotein
degradation or from adipose tissue lipolysis. on  xxxg1337xxx  activity in (and (or) release from) cardiac rnyocytes.

introduction
the triacylglycerol (tg) component of circulating lipoproteins is hydrolyzed by  xxxg1337xxx  (lpl) located at
the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells (bensadoun
1991; eckel 1989); iipolytic products (free  xxxd2154xxx  and
2-monoacylglycerol) are then available for tissue utilization.
endothelid cells cannot synthesize lpl (camps et a%.19901,
so in the heart, lpl is synthesized and processed in cardiac
myocytes and then translocated to its functional site at the
endothelium mlanchette-mackie et al. 1989). a portion of
lpl in cardiac myocytes is located on the cell surface
(rodrigues et al. 1992a, 1992b), where it can be displaced by
heparin or released after incubation with a phosphoinositidespecific phospholipase c (braun and severson 1991).
one of the factors that regulates the activity of lpl is the
level of its lipoprotein substrate. cellular lpl activity was
decreased when the culture medium of mesenchymal cells

from neonatal rat hearts was supplemented with very low
density lipoprotein (vldl); highest levels of enzyme activity
were measured in cells grown in a medium with a low tg content (friedman el a/. 1979a). conversely, friedman et al.
(1979b) showed that a reduction in plasma tg by the in vivo
administration of 4-aminspyrazobo[3,4-dl pyrirnidine (app) ,
an agent that inhibits lipoprotein secretion (shiff et ak. 1971),
resulted in an increase in rat heart lpl activity measured in
whole-tissue homogenates. the app-induced increment in rat
heart lpl activity was reversed by inhsion of vldl (friedman
et al. 1979k). therefore, there is a reciprocal relationship
between the concentration of circulating tg-rich lipoproteins
and lpl activity in cardiac tissue. regulation of lpl activity
in, and (or) release from, cardiac myocytes according to the
rate of utilization of plasma lipoproteins would provide a
mechanism to prevent the excessive delivery of free  xxxd2154xxx 
(ffa) to the myocardial cell by controlling the translocation
of lpl to its hnctional site on vascular endothelial cells, and
thus complement other mechanisms that acutely regulate the

endothelium-bound enzyme by the fatty acid product s f lipslysis, such as product inhibition and the reduction in activation
of lpl by apolipoprotein cii (bengtsson and blivecrona
1980), and displacement of epl into the circulation (peterson
et ah. 1990).
the hypertriglyceridemia which is a characteristic feature s f
insulin-deficient (type i) diabetes may, at least in part, be due
to the reduced metabolic clearance of tg-rich lipoproteins,
caused by a reduction in lpl activity (taskinen 1987).
insulin-deficient models of diabetes mellitus result in decreased
hnctional lpl activity in perhsed rat hearts with a corresponding reduction in lipolysis of vlde (o'looney et al.
1983). diabetes also produced a fdl in lpe activity in cardiac
myocytes and a reduction in the release of epl into the
medium induced by heparin and phospholipase c (braun and
severssn 1991). however, in vitro incubations with insulin
have no effect on lpl activity in control and diabetic cardiac
myocytes (braun and severson 1992). therefore, the diabetesinduced reduction in lpl activity may be secondary to some
metabolic factor other than insulin deficiency. on the basis of
the reciprocal relationship between ebl activity and levels of
its plasma substrate (friedman et ak. 1979a, 1979b), a
diabetes-induced hypertriglyceridemia due to overproduction
of tg-rich lipoproteins (gibbons 1990) could be the cause of
the reduction in myocardia%lpl activity (braun and severson
1991; o'looney et al. 1983). to test this hypothesis, the
effect of lowering circulating tg levels on heparin-releasable
lpl activity in cardiac myocytes was determined following
the administration of app to control and diabetic rats. in
addition, the effect of decreasing the utilization of circulating
tg-rich lipoproteins by triton we%-1339 (magata and zilversmit 1987) on lpl activity in cardiac myocytes was also
examined.

materials and methods
experimental aazimls
male sprague -dawley rats (200 -250 g) were fed a laboratory chow
diet (wayne rodent blox 8604) ad libitum, were allowed free access
to water, and were maintained under a light (0700- 1900 h) - dark
cycle. in some experiments, rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of app (50 mglkg in 18 mm sodium phosphate, ph 3) to reduce
circulating levels sf tg and cholesterol (friedman et a!. 1879b; shiff
 xxxg1686xxx /. 197i), and then were anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium,
15 mg ip) and elled 24 h later for perhsion of hearts or preparation
of cardiac myocytes. control rats received an injection of phosphate
buffer. when hearts were perfused, control rats were fasted to be
more comparable with np-treated rats, which exhibited decreased
food consumption with some weight loss. fasting the control group
ensured that any effect of app on heparin-releasable activity in perhsed hearts was not the result of the well-known effect of starvation
to selectively increase functional, heparin-releasable lpl activity in
perhsed hearts (borensztajn and robinson 11970). fasting has no
effect on lpl activity in cardiac myocytes (r. carroll, b. rodrigues,
and d. &. severson, unpublished observations), so the control rats
used for isolating cardiac myocytes were either fed or fasted for comparison with myocytes from app-treated rats. app was administered
for 24 h, since this time interval was shown to be optimal for increasing lpl activity in whole-heart homggeates; no change in heart
lpl activity was observed after 3 or 6 h of treatment with app
(friedman st al. 197%).
diabetes was induced by the intravenous injection s f  xxxd3249xxx 
(100 mglkg in 63.1 m citrate, ph 4.5) as described by braun and
severson (1991, 1992); diabetic rats were given food and water
ad libitum and were killed after 3 - 5 days. in some experiments, diabetic rats were treated with either insulin (toronto, 5 u iv; braun and

severson 1991), heparin (hepalean, 800 u ip). or an appropriate
saline injection for 1 h before the rats were killed.  xxxd3458xxx 
was administered to rats by an intravenous injection (300 mglkg).
control rats received a saline injection, and both control and
experimental animals were fasted for 24 h prior to killing. when app
or  xxxd3458xxx  was administered to diabetic rats, both experimental and diabetic control groups were fasted for the 24-h period
before the animals were killed. plasma samples were collected at the
time of sacrifice and frozen for subsequent chemical analyses.
hehart pe&sion
rats were anesthetized with penteabarbital (15 mg ip) and killed so
that the heart could be removed and perfused retrogradely aker cannulation of the aorta as described by rodrigues eb cad. (1992~).the
perfusion solution (solution c) was jomik minimal essential medium
supplemented with 1.2 mm mgso,, i mm dl-carnitine, 1.5 mm
caci,, and 1% (wlv) fatty acid free bovine  xxxg124xxx , and the
flow rate was 6-7 mllmin. at zero time, heparin (5 uiml) was
added to the perfusion solution. the coronary perhsate was collected
in timed fractions and frozen until assayed for lpl activity.
prepamtion and incubation of cardiac myocytes
calcium-tolerant cardiac myocytes were isolated from hearts
removed from heparinized (2 ulkg ip for 1 h) and anaesthetized (pentobarbital, 15 mg ip) rats according to rodrigues et a!. (1992a). in
some experiments as noted, myocytes were prepared without heparin
pretreatment of the rats. the time elapsed between the initial perhsion of the heart and the onset of incubations was 1.5 -2 h. the yield
of myocytes (5.5 -7.5 x 1q6 cells per heart) and viability (percentage of elongated cells with clear cross striations that excluded 8.2%
trypan blue, which ranged from 75 to 85%) were assessed microscopically. viability was unchanged during incubation of cardiac
myocytes under the experimental conditions described in the text.
mywytes were finally suspended in solution g to a cell density of
0.4 x 106cellslml and were incubated at 37 "c under an atmosphere
of 95 % 0, - 5 % co,. to study the release of lpl activity into the
medium (braun and severson 1991, 1992), heparin (5 bjlml) was
added to the incubation, and at the indicated times, 1-ml aliquots
were removed and centrifuged for 10 s at 15 000 x g in a microcentrihge. the supernatant (medium) was decanted and frozen. the corresponding cell pellets after centrifugation were also frozen and then
resuspended by sonication in 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm edta,
1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4) (braun and severson
1991; rodrigues et cad. 1992b) to give a cellular homogenate for lpl
activity determinations.
the hydrolysis of radiolabelled triolein by intact myocytes was
measured as described previously (rodrigues et a!. 1992a, 1992b).
myocytes were incubated at 330°c in solution c containing 1.5 mm
[3h]triolein (glycerol tri[9,10-3h] xxxd2777xxx ) and 4% (vlv) chicken
semm for the indicated times; lipase activity was calculated from the
release of [gh] xxxd2777xxx  into the medium. the hydrolysis of exogenous
[3h]triolein by intact cardiac myocytes has been demonstrated to be
entirely serum dependent (rodrigues et al. 1992a) and to be reduced
by heparin preincubation (rodrigues et al. 1992b), indicating that the
triolein degradation was catalyzed by lpl present on the cell surface
of myocardial cells.
in some experiments, 0.9 mm  xxxd2777xxx  was added to solution c
(6: 1 molar ratio to albumin) during the preparation of cardiac myocytes ( h r s e n and severson 1990) so that the total duration of
exposure to  xxxd2777xxx  prior to any incubation was at least 90 min; this
procedure has been used to prepare myocyas that have some of
the same characteristics as diabetic myocytes, such as an elevated
endogenous tg content. the  xxxd2777xxx -pretreated myocytes were subsequently incubated in the absence of  xxxd2777xxx  to measure the heparininduced release of lpl into the medium.
lpl assay
the activity of lpl in heart perhsates, and in the incubation
medium and homogenates of cardiac myocytes was determined by
measuring the in vitro hydrolysis of a sonicated e3w]ltriolein sub-

were 0.6 mm glycer0l-tri[9,10-~~loleate(1 mciimmol (i ci =
37 gbq)), 25 mm pipes (ph 7 3 , 0.05 r (wiv) albumin, 50 mm
mgcl,, 2% (viv) chicken serum as lpl activator, and appropriate
quantities of the heart perfusate (1w pl), incubation medium
(100 pl), or cell homogenate (20 pl) in a total volume sf 400 pl.
when lpl activity was measured in myocyte homogenates, heparin
(2 uiml) was added to the assay. the release of [3h] xxxd2777xxx  was
measured after an incubation of 30 min at 30°c; all assays were performed under conditions where eke reaction rate was linear with
respect to both time and protein.
plasm analyses
plasma samples were collected when the rats were killed. glucose
was measured with a b e c h m glucose analyzer. the plasma content
of tg, cholesterol, and nonesterified  xxxd2154xxx  was determined with
diagnostic kits from s i g m chemical co. (st. louis, mo.), boehrlnger
mannheim (laval, quebec), and wako pure chemical industries
ltd. (osaka, japan), respectively. the concentration of tg and fatty
acids was only determined in plasma samples obtained from rats that
had not been heparinized, because in vivo heparin treatment releases
lbl into the blood stream with the result that plasma tg values are
drastically reduced owing tea hydrolysis, with a corresponding increase
in fatty acid concentrations (riemersma el a / . 1982).

results
app treatment of control rats
the plasma concentrations of glucose, tg, and ffa for each
of the experimental groups of animals are given in table 1.
app treatment for 24 h produced a profound decrease in the
plasma tg concentration to 7 % of control; plasma cholesterol
levels were also reduced, to 34 f 5 % (mean f sem; n = 5)
s f control (results not shown). app had no effect on plasma
glucose or ffa concentrations in control rats, as was reported
by friedman et a / . (197%).
app treatment increased the heparin-induced release of lpl
from cardiac myocytes; results from a typical experiment are
shown in fig. 1. in four experiments, the heparin-induced
release of lpl was enhanced by 38 f 4.7 % in myocyte preparations from app-treated rats. interestingly, the total cellular

in the plasma tg concentration caused by app (table 1) was
also associated with a significant elevation in heparin-releasable
epl activity (64% increase; average from all perfusion times)
in perfused hearts (fig. 2). therefore, a reciprocal relationship between plasma tg levels and lpl activity was observed
for both isolated cardiac myocytes and perfbased hearts.

app treatment of diabetic rats
the acute (3 -5 day) and severe model of diabetes produced
by the administration of 100 mg  xxxd3249xxx /kg resulted in
both hyperglycemia, as noted previously (braun and severson
1991, 19921, and hyperlipidemia (table 1). administration of
app to diabetic rats for 1 day prior to killing reduced elevated
plasma tg concentrations to less than control values. plasma
cholesterol levels in diabetic rats were also reduced by app
treatment (results not shown), but the diabetes-induced hyperglycemia was not influenced by app (table 1). the plasma
ffa level in app-treated diabetic rats was not significantly
different from the concentration in untreated diabetic rats.
intact cardiac rnywytes have been shown to hydrolyze
exogenous [3h]triolein added to the incubation medium
through the action of lpl present on the myocardial cell surface (rodrigues et al. 1992a, 1992b). the degradation of

bars are shown for some times. probability values were calculated by
a student's t-test: *, g < 0.05 relative to control.

exogenous triolein by diabetic myocytes was markedly reduced
in comparison with control cardiac myscytes (fig. 3), indicating that diabetes decreased surface-bomd lpl activity. the
observation that the release of ebl induced by heparin and
phospholigase qzwas reduced in cardiac myocytes from diabetic rat hearts (braun and severssn 1991) is consistent with
this observation. the inhibitory effect of diabetes on the
heparin-induced release of lpe into the incubation medium
of cardiac myocytes is also shown in fig. 4a. administration
of app t s diabetic rats increased, but did lnd~tnsrmdize, rates of
lpl release (fig. 4b). in three experiments, abp treatment
resulted in a 56 f 12% enhancement of the heparin-induced
release of lpl from diabetic cardiac myocytes. for the
experiment shown in fig. 4b, the total cellular activity prior
to addition of heparin was increased from 1108 to 1420 nmol
 xxxd2777xxx  released h-i - 10-$ cells in app-treated myscytes.
app also increased heparin-releasable lpl activity in perhsed diabetic rat hearts (results not show). therefore, diabetesinduced hypertriglyceridemia is associated with decreased
lpl activity, which can be partially reversed by app, suggesting that elevated plasma tg levels may be the cause,
rather than the effect, of the diminished lbl activity in
cardiac myocytes.
the reduction in the heparin-induced release of lpl from
diabetic cardiac myocytes can be rapidly reversed by in vkvo
treatment of diabetic rats with insulin (5 u, iv) for only 1 h
(braun and severson 199i , 1992). to determine if this acute
effect of insulin could be secondary to changes in plasma lipid
concentrations, rats were treated with in vivo insulin, and the
effect on lpl release was compared with results from rats
given an acute injection of heparin to reduce the concentration
s f plasma tg. insulin administration to diabetic rats reduced

the elevated plasma tg level and increased the heparininduced release of lpl from cardiac myocytes to near control
rates (fig. 5). in comparison, although treatment of diabetic
rats with heparin produced the same fall in plasma tg as
insulin, the release of lpl from cardiac myocytes was only
slightly increased by heparin pretreatment (fig. 5). therefore,
it is unlikely that the ability of insulin to acutely reverse the
effects sf diabetes on the heparin-induced release of lpl is
due to a f d l in plasma tg. heparin treatment of control rats
for 2-4 h d s o had only a slight stirnulatory effect on the subsequent heparin-induced release s f lpl from cardiac myocytes (results not shown), thus establishing that the routine
practice of heparinizing rats prior to the preparation of cardiac
myocytes does not confound subsequent measurements of lpe
release.
treatment sf control and diabetic rats with  xxxd3458xxx 
the peripheral lipolysis s f tg-rich lipoproteins can be
inhibited by triton we%-i339so that newly secreted lipsprsteins accumulate in the plasma (nagata and zilvenmit 1987).
although administration s f triton wr- 1339 to control rats
resulted in a plasma tg level s f 7.3 mm after 24 h, the
heparin-induced release of lpl from cardiac myocytes was
not reduced (fig. 6a). therefore, the chronic elevation of
plasma tg has no inhibitory effect on epl release from
cardiac mywytes in the absence of lipolysis. the reduction in
tg degradation induced by  xxxd3458xxx  did, however,
increase heparin-releasable epl activity in diabetic cardiac
myocytes (fig. 6b). the plasma tg value in diabetic rats
treated with triton ww-1339 was 4.6 f 0.68 rnm (n = 4);
plasma ffa levels were unchanged. these results indicate
that the ffa product from lipolysis of plasma tg must be
the inhibitory signal that regulates lpl activity in cardiac
myocytes.

lpl activity measured in whole hearts from fed rats treated
with heparin. fuflhermcere, the intravenous injection of  xxxd3230xxx  for 1 h to produce hypertriglyceridemia did not change
heart lpl activity (peterson et al. 1985). therefore, chronic
changes in the plasma concentration of tg-rich lipoproteins
must be required for regulation of lpl activity in cardiac
tissue.
the administration of app for 24 h to control rats resulted
in a pronounced fa11 in the plasma tg concentration (table 1)
and an increase in the heparin-induced release of lpl from
cardiac myocytes (fig. 1) and in heparin-releasable lpl
activity in perfused hearts (fig. 2). friedman et al. (1979b)
were the first to observe that app treatment increased lpl
activity in the whole heart, but functional (heparin releasable)
lpl activity or enzyme activity in myocytes was not measured
in their experiments. insulin-deficient models of diabetes
mellitus result in hypertriglyceridemia (taskinen 1987), and a
reduction in lipolysis of vldl and in functional, heparinreleasable lpl activity in perhsed hearts (09looney et ak.
1983). administration of app to diabetic rats reversed the
hypertriglyceridemia (table 1) and significantly increased the
heparin-induced release of lpl from isolated cardiac myocytes (fig. 4). these results suggest that the decrease in heart
lpl activity associated with diabetes may, at least in part, be
secondary to an inhibitory effect of the elevated levels s f
tg-rich lipoprotein substrates since app treatment did not
change plasma ffa levels significantly (table 1). hypertriglyceridemia in the absence of lipslysis as produced by
 xxxd3458xxx  (nagata and zilversmit 1987) had no ihibitory effect on the heparin-induced release of lpl from control
cardiac myocytes (fig. 6a), indicating that lipolytic products

sylatisn, and (or) direct inhibitory effects on the intracellular
transport s f lpl or release of lpl from the myocardial cell
surface, perhaps by influencing heparan sulfate protesglycan
binding sites for lpl (fig. 8). as a consequence, translocation of lpl to binding sites on the surface of vascular endsthelial cells will be reduced with the result that functional lpl
activity will decline as a further compensatory mechanism to
prevent the oversupply of ffa to myocardial cells, and so

hypertriglyceridenaia will be accentuated as a result of a
removal defect (taskinen 1987).
it follows that elevations in circulating ffa as a consequence of accelerated rates of adipose tissue lipolysis due t s
insulin deficiency should d s s contribute to the regulation of
lpl in diabetic cardiac myscytes in the same manner as ffa

the utilization of plasma tg as a consequence of either app
(fig. 4b) or triton ww-1339 (fig. 6b) increased, but did not
normalize, heparin-induced lpl release from diabetic cardiac
myocytes. the in vktro preparation of cardiac myocytes in the
presence of  xxxd2777xxx  resulted in a reduction in cellular and
heparin-releasable lpl activities (fig. 7) to an extent that was
very similar to results with diabetic cardiac myocytes (fig. 4;
see d s o braun and severson 1991). therefore, although ffa
did not acutely displace surface-bound epl into the incubation
medium of cardiac myocytes (rodrigues et al. 1992a), chronic
exposure to  xxxd2777xxx  for greater than 60 min can reduce lpl
activity (fig. 7; rodrigues et a&.1992b). the medium content
of ffa was not measured during incubations of cardiac myocytes. however, the acute exposure of myocytes to ffa does
not result in the transfer of inhibitory quantities of  xxxd2154xxx 
into the lpl assay (rodrigues et a&.h992w) or reduce heparinreleasable enzyme activity during incubations of up to 60 min
(rodrigues et al. 1992b), indicating that medium ffa does
not affect the stability of released lpl under these conditions.
previous studies have shown that lpl is not inactivated in the
medium of cardiac myocytes following secretion (severson
et al. 1988). further experimentation with cultured cardiac
myocytes where the content of various components in the
medium can be varied systematically to mimic the in viva
condition of diabetes will be necessary to further test the suggestion (fig. 8) that the diabetes-induced reduction in lpl
activity in cardiac myocytes is, in part, secondary to elevated
plasma lipid concentrations and the associated enhanced chronic
delivery of ffa to myocardial cells in the heart.
twolimitations in the model of epl regulation presented in
fig. 8 must be acknowledged, however. first, fasting-induced
increases in plasma ffa cannot be reconciled with observations that heparin-releasable lpl activity was either increased
in perfused hearts (borensztajn and robinson 1970; rodrigues
et al. 19920) or unchanged in cardiac myocytes following fasting. therefore, the model presented in fig. 8 may only be
applicable to an acute, severe form of insulin-deficient diabetes. differences in the absolute levels of circulating ffa
and (or) in individual fatty acid species may contribute to the
discrepancy between the effects of diabetes and fasting on
myocardial epl activity. diabetes resulted in a threefold
increase in the intracellular content of ffa in cardiac myocytes from diabetic rat hearts (kenno and severson 1885);
comparable measurements have not been performed for cardiac
myocytes isolated from fasting rats. second, dthough cardiac
myocytes represent the principal source of lpl activity in
control hearts (blanchette-mackie et ak. 1989; camps et ak.
1990), the contribution of other cell types in diabetic hearts
cannot be excluded. for example, lpl synthesis has been localized to interstitial (mesenchyrnal) cells in cholera toxin treated
hearts (stein et a&.1991). therefore, regulatory mechanisms
in nonmyocardid cells may also contribute to the diabetesinduced reduction in functional enzyme activity at the endothelium of the heart.
comparison of the acute (1 h) effects of insulin and heparin
administered in vivo (fig. 5) indicates that the stimulatory
effect of insulin on heparin-releasable lpl activity in diabetic
myocytes is probably not due to a fall in plasma tc.in other
words, the mechanism(s) responsible for the acute stimulatory
effect of insulin on lpl activity in cardiac myocytes is (are)
likely different from the mechanisms presented in fig. 8 for
the reduction in enzyme activity associated with chronic
insulin deficiency. a similar conclusion has come from studies

on the acute insulin activation of pyruvate dehydrogenae as
compared with the chronic effects of diabetes (benton eb al.
1989). insulin has no direct effect on ebe activity as determined from in vivo incubations of control and diabetic cardiac
myocytes (braun and severson 1992), suggesting that insulin
may require the presence of some other in viva factor, such as
another hormone or metabolite, to stimulate lbe activity in
cardiac myocytes. this possibility is currently under investigation in our laboratory, using cultured cardiac rnyocytes as
the test system.
the mechanism presented in fig. 8 for regulation of heart
lpl activity in diabetes that is mediated by plasma lipids is
tissue specific. the decline in lpl activity in adipose tissue
as a consequence of diabetes (chen et al. 1980) will likely be
a direct consequence of insulin deficiency. insulin has been
shown to directly stimulate adipose tissue lpl activity
(raynolds et a!. 1990; semenkovich et al. 1989). the direct
regulation of adipose tissue lpl by insulin would explain the
lack of correlation between the reduction in adipose tissue
lpl activity and the extent of hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes
(chen et a&.1980), and the observation that an app-induced
decrease in plasma tg resulted in a decrease in adipose tissue
lpl activity (friedman et a&.1979b), in contrast to the stimulatory effect noted in cardiac tissue (figs. 1 and 2; friedman
et a[. 1979b). the reduced vldl degradation observed in
diabetes (chen et al. 1980; taskinen 1987) will also include
contributions from other mechanisms in addition to decreased
lpl activity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscles and heart
(deshaies et a / . 1991), such as altered apoprotein content
(09looney et al. 1985) and glycation of apoproteins (marno
et al. 1990) in lipoprotein substrates that reduces their
catabolism.
