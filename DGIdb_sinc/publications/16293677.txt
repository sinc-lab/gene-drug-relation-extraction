treating hcv with ribavirin analogues and ribavirin-like molecules
robert g. gish*

nucleos(t)ide analogues have proven useful in the treatment of viral infections. ribavirin is a nucleoside,
guanosine analogue, whose mechanisms of action include inhibition of  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase (impdh), which is the key step in de novo guanine synthesis, a requirement for viral replication.
in combination with pegylated interferon alfa, ribavirin is the standard of care for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis c today. however, the medication is associated with significant haemolytic anaemia, which may
require dose reduction, discontinuation or treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin. dose reduction also appears to decrease sustained viral clearance rates. newer impdh inhibitors are in various stages
of development. viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has demonstrated significant antiviral
activity and erythrocyte-sparing properties. it is currently in phase 3 trials. clinical trials of merimepodib,
another investigational impdh inhibitor, have completed enrolment for a phase 2b study as a third
medication for administration with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. although other imdph inhibitors
also have antiviral activity, these medications appear best suited as immunosuppressive medications at
this time.

244.2 (figure 1).7

introduction
clinical studies of combination therapies for chronic hepatitis c
have shown sustained viral response (svr) rates of 55%.1,2
efforts to raise this rate of response have been blocked by numerous
obstacles involving patient, viral and medication factors, including
patient- and virus-related variables (e.g. cirrhosis, viral levels, race,
genotype), adverse events requiring dose reductions or medication
discontinuation (e.g. anaemia, depression, cytopenias) and nonadherence to treatment regimens. for example, an essential component of therapy for chronic hepatitis c is ribavirin, a nucleoside
analogue that inhibits  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase
(impdh), among other mechanisms of action; however, ribavirin
is also associated with potential dose-limiting haemolytic anaemia
that compromises svr rates.3,4 pharmaceutical manufacturers are
responding by developing a number of new, safer anti-hepatitis
c virus (hcv) medications including impdh inhibitors, protease
inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, helicase inhibitors, internal ribosomal entry site inhibitors, small and expressed interfering rnas,
ribozymes and several new interferons (e.g. albumin-interferon
alfa, consensus-interferon, interferon-g).5,6 several ribavirin-like
molecules presently under development have the potential to
improve outcome compared with standard ribavirin.

pharmacology
nucleotide synthesis in hcv infection. hcv is an enveloped virus
and member of the genus hepacivirus within the flaviviridae
family.9 it has a single-stranded rna genome with positive polarity. within the cell, nucleotides required for rna and dna synthesis are made available through one of two pathways: (i) salvage
from recycling nucleosides and nucleobases from native rna and
dna; and (ii) de novo synthesis. the rapidity of the cell cycle may
necessitate a greater complement of nucleotides than are available
by salvage alone and, thus, the de novo pathway has been proposed
as the primary source of nucleotides for rna and dna synthesis in
rapidly proliferative cell synthesis (figure 2).10,11 in de novo

figure 3. immune-mediated and direct antiviral activities of ribavirin. this
illustration demonstrates five potential mechanisms of action of ribavirin in
patients with chronic hepatitis c: (i) the drug enhances immune clearance of
the virus by facilitating the switch from a th2 to a th1 phenotype with resultant
production of antiviral cytokines such as tnf and ifn; (ii) rmp inhibits the
enzymatic activity of impdh in the conversion of imp into gmp; (iii) by
inhibiting hcv rdrp activity, rtp inhibits hcv rna replication; (iv) rtp
also acts as an rna mutagen; and (v) the combined direct antiviral activities of
steps (ii)–(iv) result in down-regulation of hcv virion production while hcv
particles that are released are defective. ctl, cytotoxic t lymphocytes; hcv,

conversion of  xxxd557xxx  into xanthine monophosphate, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides. the enzyme has two isoforms: the type i isoform is
constitutively expressed, whereas the type ii isoform is upregulated in rapidly proliferating cells.12 inhibitors of impdh

direct mechanisms of action. ribavirin enters the cell as a
prodrug and is converted into ribavirin 50 -monophosophate (rmp),
-diphosphate (rdp) and -triphosphate (rtp) through the sequential actions of three cellular kinases (figure 3).8 the actions of
rmp, a direct competitive inhibitor of impdh, decreases intracellular levels of  xxxd2247xxx  (gtp). because gtp is
essential for transcription of viral genomes and replication of
rna viruses, low levels of gtp are thought to down-regulate
viral replication. ribavirin inhibits viral guanylyltransferase and
mrna (guanine-7n-)-methyltransferase activity, thereby creating
mrna with abnormal 50 -cap structures and blocking viral transcription.13 ribavirin phosphates inhibit viral polymerase; consequently, the enzyme is unable to create copies of the original
positive-stranded (antisense) viral rna.14 in addition, ribavirin
can be incorporated into viral rna by the polymerase15 giving
rise to ribavirin-induced mutations in the viral genome and replication error (suicide mutations) catastrophe, which results in
fewer infectious virions16 and thus interferes with inter-hepatocyte
infection. this raises concerns about the damage to host genetic
(chromosomal) structures and probably results in or contributes to
the teratogenicity of ribavirin. ribavirin is also considered as a
carcinogen in some animal and in vivo models.7,17

process continues th2 predominance develops, which is associated
with infection chronicity.19 this may be the result of suppressive
effects of hcv core proteins on production of  xxxg1164xxx , a
cytokine essential for induction of th1 immunity.20 administration
of ribavirin shifts the response towards th1 cells and their associated cytokines.21 the resultant th1 cytokines, particularly
interferon-g, appear to inhibit production of the hcv virion,
enhance immunologically mediated lysis of infected hepatocytes,
inhibit neoplastic transformation and down-regulate hepatic fibrogenesis.20 the latter appears to inhibit proliferation and activation
of hepatic stellate cells, which are the principal mediators of
hepatic collagen formation and extracellular matrix deposition.22

adverse events
ribavirin is associated with haemolytic anaemia that can be either
predictable and dose related or unpredictable and potentially dose
limiting. plasma ribavirin is transported into erythrocytes by the
‘es’ nucleoside transporter and is converted into rmp, rdp and
rtp.23 the ribavirin phosphates accumulate because erythrocytes
lack the phosphatases needed to hydrolyse them.23 accumulation
of the ribavirin phosphates, with a relative deficiency of adenosine
triphosphate, produces cellular toxicity and subsequent extravascular haemolysis. depletion of high energy phosphates is thought

indirect mechanisms of action. acute control of hcv rna levels
occurs through a brisk intrahepatic t-helper and t-suppressor cell
response, a shift toward a th1 cytokine profile and up-regulated
natural killer cell activity.18 this adaptive immune response
favours elimination of virus-infected cells. however, as this

adverse events. pharmacokinetic and safety studies of viramidine
have demonstrated that it is safe and tolerable. most reported
adverse events are mild. the respective percentages of treatment-emergent adverse events that were deemed possibly related
to viramidine 200, 600 and 1200 mg were 0, 26 and 50%, respectively.23 the majority of adverse events were mild and most
resolved without sequelae.

the efficacy of ribavirin monotherapy in patients with hcv infection has been evaluated in several randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials.27,28 results of these and other clinical
evaluations29–31 indicated that ribavirin treatment had modest transient effects on plasma hcv rna levels but lowered aminotransferase levels. study results also suggest that ribavirin monotherapy
leads to improvement in hepatic histology in some patients who
show a biochemical response.28,29,32 however, the biochemical
responses are usually transient and the histological improvements
are generally modest. in combination with standard or pegylated
interferon, however, ribavirin significantly improves virological
outcomes by reducing relapse rates. therefore, this combination
is the current standard of care.33

clinical trial results. end-of-treatment and svr results from a
phase 2 randomized, active-controlled, multicentre study of pegylated  xxxd2365xxx  plus either viramidine or ribavirin in
180 treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis c demonstrated
no significant differences between the treatment groups in the
proportion of patients with undetectable hcv rna levels, regardless of hcv genotype during therapy.38,39 however, significantly
fewer patients developed anaemia in the viramidine-treatment
groups than in the ribavirin group (4% versus 27%; p < 0.001)
(figure 5). no cases of anaemia were reported among patients
receiving viramidine 400 mg twice daily, and only one case was
reported among those receiving 600 mg twice daily (2%). in contrast, the incidence of defined anaemia was 11% in the viramidine
800 mg twice daily treatment group and 27% in the ribavirin group.
other adverse events were similarly observed between treatment
groups.38,39
phase 3 trials of viramidine 600 mg twice daily, known as
viser1 and viser2 (viramidine’s safety and efficacy versus
ribavirin), are currently comparing viramidine plus pegylated
 xxxd2365xxx  or -2b. these studies were designed to determine
whether viramidine is as effective as ribavirin and to confirm the
medication’s erythrocyte-sparing properties—an effect that would
remove ribavirin-related anaemia and the associated need for dose
modification or recombinant human erythropoietin from the
therapeutic equation.

ribavirin-like molecules in development
viramidine
pharmacology. viramidine is a liver-targeting, synthetic nucleotide prodrug of ribavirin. studies of the immunomodulatory activity
of the medication indicate that its effect on th1 cytokine production
and t-cell proliferation is preserved and similar to that of ribavirin.34 viramidine is structurally similar to adenosine35 and can
thus be converted into its active form by hepatic  xxxg62xxx , a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of adenosine to inosine and ammonia (figure 4). both ribavirin and
viramidine are rapidly eliminated. both the parent molecules
and metabolites are excreted by the kidneys and have a tmax of

1.5–3 h.23 neither medication significantly binds to serum proteins.36 in non-human primates, the higher viramidine:ribavirin
ratio in portal compared with systemic plasma indicates that viramidine is predominantly taken up by the liver (first pass effect)
and activated (converted) in the liver to ribavirin by adenosine
deaminase.37 the ribavirin once it is derived from viramidine is
subsequently concentrated in the liver. experimentally, hepatic
retention of the ribavirin that is derived from a single oral dose
of viramidine is 3-fold greater than that of oral ribavirin. in the
same non-human primate model, viramidine produces 50% higher
levels of ribavirin in the liver but only one-half in the plasma and
red blood cells (rbcs).23 because it produces lower rbc levels
of ribavirin phosphates, viramidine has the potential to maintain
hb concentrations in patients treated with combination therapy.
studies of cytochrome p450 metabolism in pooled hepatic microsomal fractions indicate that neither medication significantly
inhibits or activates the principal human cytochromes.36 both viramidine and ribavirin are filtered by the glomeruli and excreted into
the urine; however, the amount of either medication measured in
urine is only 2–5% indicating that both are predominantly eliminated by metabolism.

to lead to down-regulation of the hexose monophosphate shunt with
an associated increased sensitivity of the erythrocyte to oxidative
damage and resultant haemolysis.24 ribavirin-related anaemia often
occurs rapidly during the first 4 weeks of therapy, when it is crucial
to maintain ribavirin levels to maximize chances for an svr.
in clinical trials, haemoglobin (hb) levels in pegylated
interferon/ribavirin-treated patients decrease by an average of
2–3 g/dl. approximately 10–13% of patients experience significant anaemia with hb levels declining below 10 g/dl, the cut point
for initiating ribavirin dose reduction in accordance with the ribavirin prescribing information, and up to 52% of patients develop a
hb of <12, the threshold at which oncology patients begin to
experience symptoms associated with decreases in quality of
life.25,26 however, because the effect of anaemia on outcomes is
a function of factors, such as gender, renal function, geographic
elevation, age, comorbidities, activity and rate of hb decreases,
dose reductions may be necessary in patients with hb levels
>10 g/dl. in the pegylated  xxxd2365xxx –ribavirin licensing
study anaemia prompted ribavirin dose reductions in 22% of
patients treated for 48 weeks.25

development for the treatment of hcv infection. merimepodib
inhibits both impdh isoforms and is structurally unrelated to
other medications that show similar catalytic activity. when tested
against a variety of dna and rna viruses merimepodib demonstrated significant activity.10 combination therapy with merimepodib or ribavirin plus interferon alfa showed modest additive
activity, with merimepodib more potent in this combination than
ribavirin.

other impdh inhibitors
 xxxd2677xxx  is an impdh inhibitor used for immunosuppression in the transplantation setting, including orthotopic
liver transplantation in patients with chronic hepatitis c
(figure 7). its immunosuppressive activities appear to far exceed
the medication’s antiviral properties, although there are currently
no ongoing trials to evaluate the medication in this indication.42
mycophenolate may be useful for immunosuppression in patients
with autoimmune disease as well as autoimmune liver disease and
can help with manifestations of chronic hepatitis c.43 mizoribine is
an impdh inhibitor that is marketed as an immunosuppressant
(figure 8). like mycophenolate, mizoribine has shown antiviral
properties but is not currently in clinical trials for treatment of
hepatitis c. mizoribine inhibits the replication of hcv at a concentration (5 mm) similar to that reported for ribavirin44 and thus
may find use in anti-hcv regimens in the future.

pharmacology. zha et al.40 performed a pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic analysis to evaluate the potential relationships
between the plasma exposure to merimepodib and ribavirin and the
12-week virological responses or development of anaemia in 31
patients who did not respond to a previous course of pegylated
interferon plus ribavirin. merimepodib or placebo was administered in combination with ribavirin plus pegylated interferon alfa2a to 31 patients infected with hcv genotype 1. at the end of
12 weeks, 28 patients had completed therapy with pegylated interferon plus weight-based ribavirin in addition to placebo (n = 9),
merimepodib 25 mg (n = 8) or merimepodib 50 mg (n = 11) given
every 12 h.40
preliminary results showed that the auc0–12 of merimepodib
was significantly higher in patients who showed a virological
response than in those who did not.40 in the logistical regression
analysis, age and merimepodib auc0–12 were the only significant
predictors of 12 week virological response. at week 12, a 2-log
drop in hcv rna was reported in 60%, 75% and 80% of patients

has made it a central component in pegylated interferon-based

combination therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis c. however,
the haemolytic anaemia associated with ribavirin therapy is
potentially dose limiting. whereas recombinant human erythropoietin can be used to treat the anaemia, its use adds a second
medication to treat the complications of the first medication.
experimental studies have demonstrated that other impdh inhibitors have antiviral activity. viramidine, a liver-targeting ribavirin
prodrug, has been shown to have end-of-treatment efficacy and
svr comparable to that of ribavirin when combined with pegylated interferon with a substantially lower rate of anaemia. if two
large ongoing phase 3 trials confirm this, viramidine may be used
more commonly as the oral antiviral agent in combination regimens
with pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c.
while a phase 2b trial of merimepodib has completed enrolment,
preliminary pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic results of the
anti-hcv activity of merimepodib in combination with pegylated
interferon plus ribavirin have resulted in discontinuation of clinical
trials. current data suggest that all other impdh inhibitors such as
mycophenolate are best used as immunosuppressive therapy.
