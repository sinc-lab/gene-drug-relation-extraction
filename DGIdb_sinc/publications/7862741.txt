effect of anesthetic and convulsant
barbiturates on n-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor-mediated calcium flux in
brain membrane vesicles

 

abstract

the effects of anesthetic and convulsant barbiturates on brain
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor function were exam-
ined in a cell-free membrane vesicle preparation from mouse
hippocampus. increases in intracellular free calcium concen-
trations (ca;) were determined using a fluorescent dye, indo-1,
after stimulation with the nmda receptor agonist, l-gluta-
mate. anesthetic barbiturates inhibited nmda responses in a
concentration-dependent manner with a rank order of potency
of  xxxd3183xxx  >  xxxd158xxx  > pentobarbital > mephobarbi-
tal = phenobarbital >>  xxxd285xxx . however, the icso values for
these barbiturates were larger than probable blood anesthetic
concentrations. barbiturates with both anesthetic and  xxxd2924xxx -
sant effects in mice [optical isomers of pentobarbital and seco-
 xxxd285xxx , 5-(2-cyclohexylideneethyl)-5-ethylbarbituric acid
and (+/-)-dimethylbutylbarbituric acid] also reduced nuda
responses. inhibition of nmda responses by racemic pento-
 xxxd285xxx  or isomers of pentobarbital was noncompetitive.
resting ca; was altered by all barbiturates tested except seco-
 xxxd285xxx  and  xxxd285xxx , but not in a consistent manner, suggest-
ing that the effect of barbiturates on resting caj is not related
either to their effects on nmda receptor responses or to their
behavioral effects. therse results show that anesthetic and
convulsant barbiturates inhibit nmda responses, but their
anesthetic and convulsant activities may be primarily due to
their effects on other brain targets.

introduction

barbiturates are members of the structur-
ally diverse group of general anesthetic drugs.
some barbiturates exhibit convulsant activity
in addition to their anesthetic activity [1].
recent work indicates that barbiturates may
produce anesthesia by specific actions on
brain receptors, including receptors for exci-
tatory amino acids (eaas) [2-4] and y-ami-
nobutyric acid (gaba) [5]. eaas themselves
produce convulsion [6] and facilitate kindling
[7], while blockers of eaa receptors can pro-
duce anesthesia [8] and enhance the anesthe-
sia produced by volatile and nonvolatile gen-
eral anesthetics [9-11].

the role of the various eaa receptor sub-
types in the actions of convulsant and anes-
thetic barbiturates is unclear. based on elec-
trophysiological and pharmacological data,
eaa receptors have been subdivided into
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) and non-
nmda types. in some brain neuronal prepa-
rations, non-nmda receptors appear more
sensitive to the inhibitory effects of anesthetic
barbiturates [12], but nmda responses are
also sensitive to inhibition by barbiturates and
other general anesthetic agents [3, 4, 13, 14].
behavioral experiments from this laboratory
also provide evidence for the role of nmda
receptors in anesthesia. when administered
intracerebroventricularly, nmda antagonists
produce anesthesia, while nmda itself pro-
duces seizures [daniell, unpublished data].
nmda antagonists also strongly potentiate
the duration of anesthesia (loss of righting
reflex) produced by pentobarbital [10, 11].

activation of the nmda receptor in-
creases the conductance of the receptor-asso-
ciated ion channel for ca?*, resulting an in-
creases in the intracellular free calcium con-
centration (ca;) [15-17]. nmda responses
have recently been characterized in brain
membrane vesicles by measuring nmda-

stimulated increases in ca; using a fluorescent
dye (indo-1) and 45ca influx [16, 17]. nmda
responses produced by nmda or l-gluta-
mate are enriched in microsacs, a fraction
which consists of membrane vesicles contain-
ing postsynaptic and presynaptic structures
[18] but are small in synaptosomes, a vesicle
fraction which is enriched in presynaptic
structures, but depleted of postsynaptic struc-
tures [19], suggesting that most nmda recep-
tors are localized post-synaptically. agonists
for non-nmda eaa receptor subtypes, kai-
nate and  xxxd3068xxx , are relatively inactive in
microsacs [17] and responses to nmda and
l-glutamate are inhibited by the nmda re-
ceptor antagonists, mg?*, 5-methyl-10,1 1-di-
hydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-im-
ine (mk-801), 2-amino-7-phosphonohepta-
noic acid, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic
acid, and zn2*, indicating that nmda- and
l-glutamate-stimulated increases in caj in
microsacs are due to the activation of nmda
receptors [16, 17]. nmda itself is a partial
agonist, while /-glutamate is a full agonist of
hippocampal and cerebrocortical nmda re-
ceptors [20, 21].

the aim of this study was to characterize
the effects of anesthetic barbiturates and bar-
biturates with both anesthetic and convulsant
activity on nmda receptor responses in
brain membrane vesicles. the results show
that anesthetic barbiturates and barbiturates
with mixed convulsant and anesthetic activity
inhibit nmda responses.

methods

male icr mice (harlan, 60-120 days old) were
used in all experiments. indo-1-am was obtained from
molecular probes and dissolved in dmso. the (+)
and (-)-isomers of pentobarbital and  xxxd3183xxx 
were obtained from the national institute of drug
abuse through the research resources drug supply
system. 5-(2-cyclohexylideneethyl)-5-ethylbarbituric

297
acid (cheb) and (+/-)-dimethylbutylbarbituric acid
(dmbb) were gifts of dr. raj ticku. all other chemi-
cals and barbiturates were obtained from sigma
chemical co. or fisher and were of the highest grade
available.

preparation of microsacs and incorporation of

indo-1

microsacs were prepared as described previously
[16]. mouse brain areas were homogenized by hand in
ice-cold assay buffer (mmol/l: nacl, 120; kci, 5; glu-
cose, 10; hepes, 25; and  xxxg2125xxx , 1.5; ph adjusted to
7.4 with naoh) using a teflon to glass homogenizer at
1:15 wt/vol. the homogenate was centrifuged at
1,000 g for 15 min. the pellet was resuspended with
ice-cold sucrose-hepes (mmol/l: sucrose, 320;
hepes, 3; edta, 0.1; ph adjusted to 7.4 with tris
base) to adjust the proein concentration to about 5 mg,
protein/ml, and incubated in a shaking water bath for
30 min at 35°c with dmso (0.17%) for control sam-
ples or with indo-1-am (final concentration, 1.7 pmol/
1). indo-1-am incorporation and its hydrolysis to indo-
1 free acid was terminated by the additon of 5 vol of
ice-cold assay buffer. the suspension was centrifuged
at 5,500 g for 20 min. the pellet was resuspended with
assay buffer and the microsac suspension was kept at
0-4°c for up to 3.5h before use. protein concentra-
tions were determined by the method of lowry et al.
[22].

determination of ca;

ca; was determined using a t-format hh-3 spec-
trofluorometer (h&l instruments; burlingame, calif.)
with continuous computer-assisted data acquisition.
indo-1 fluorescence was monitored at an excitation
wavelength of 345 nm and emission wavelengths of
410 and 500 nm (10-nm bandpass filters; microcoat-
ings). the maximal and minimal ratios were deter-
mined from at least one sample of each microsac prep-
aration, the maximal ratio was measured in the pres-
ence of 25 jzmol/l  xxxd2379xxx  and assay buffer which
contained 1.5 mmol/l  xxxg2125xxx ; the minimal ratio was
determined in the same sample after addition of
egta (final concentration, 18 mmol/l). leakage of
indo-1 (<5% over 5 min at 35°c) was subtracted from
experimental sample values after measurement of the
decrease in fluorescence intensity produced by
50 mol/l mncl, immediately after its addition. all
values were corrected for autofluorescence/light scat-
tering using control samples with measurements per-
formed in an identical manner. ca; was calculated
according to grynkiewicz et al. [23] using a ky for ca2*
of 250 nmol/l.

immediately before determination of caj, a 0.5-ml
aliquot (about 1 mg protein/sample) of the microsac
suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 or 16,000 g for
30s and resuspended with 2.5 ml of warm (35°c)
assay buffer containing 0.3 mol/l glycine. drugs were
added in a 25-1 volume using microliter syringes. a
magnetic stirrer was used to mix samples. the sample
temperature was maintained at 32 + 0.4°c, deter-
mined using a sample temperature probe (h&l instru-
ments, burlingame, calif.).

determination of duration of anesthesia

anesthetic doses of barbiturates were administered
inraperitoneally. immediately after onset of anesthesia
(loss of righting reflex), animals were placed on their
backs in triangular troughs. duration of anesthesia was
defined as the time from barbiturate administration to
regaining of righting reflex twice within 1 min.

data analysis and statistics

the data were analyzed by one-way or two-way
anova. for percent of control data comparing barbi-
turate optical isomers, data were first normalized by
transformation as the arcsine of the square root. post
hoc analysis was by fisher’s protected least significant
difference test. differences were considered significant
at the p< 0.05 level.

results

nmda responses were determined in hip-
pocampal microsacs using 30 jtmol/i l-gluta-
mate. this concentration of l-glutamate pro-
duces maximal increases in ca; (data not
shown). anesthetic barbiturates dose- xxxd2870xxx -
dently reduced nmda responses stimulated
by l-glutamate in hippocampal microsacs in
mg?*-free buffer with 0.3 mol/l glycine
(fig. 1,2). the relatively impotent barbitu-
rate,  xxxd285xxx , did not alter nmda responses
at concentrations up to 6 mmol/l (fig. 2; data
not shown for concentrations above 1 mmol/
1). the order of potency (icso) for the five
active anesthetic barbiturates tested was
 xxxd3183xxx  (0.16 mmol/l) >  xxxd158xxx 
(0.56 mmol/l) > pentobarbital (1.0 mmol/l) >
 xxxd2569xxx  = phenobarbital (2.0 mmol/l).

of isomers of pentobarbital and  xxxd3183xxx 
are shown in table 2. no difference between
pentobarbital isomers was found for alow dose
(50 mg/kg; table 2). however, the duration of
anesthesia produced by a 75-mg/kg dose of (-)-
pentobarbital was 138% greater than that
produced by the same dose of (+)-pentobarbi-

in male icr mice, intraperitoneal admin-

duced severe tonic-clonic seizures and death
within 10 min after intraperitoneal adminis-

nation of the anesthetic effects of dmbb,
mice were pretreated with the anticonvulsant
barbiturate, phenobarbital (75 mg/kg), to
block the majority of seizure activity and
allow expression of anesthetic activity. ob-

which was greater than that produced by eith-
er pentobarbital isomer but less than that pro-
duced by  xxxd3183xxx  isomers (table 3).

discussion

the results of this study show that barbitu-
rates inhibit nmda receptor responses in
hippocampal microsacs. for barbiturates
lacking significant convulsant activity, the or-
der of potency for inhibition of nmda re-
sponses ( xxxd3183xxx  >  xxxd158xxx  > pento-
 xxxd285xxx  >  xxxd2569xxx  = phenobarbital >>
 xxxd285xxx ) was similar but not identical to that
for duration of loss of righting reflex after
administration of an anesthetic dose (secobar-
bital > pentobarbital >  xxxd158xxx  > mepho-

 xxxd285xxx  > phenobarbital >>  xxxd285xxx ). when
barbiturates with both anesthetic and  xxxd2924xxx -
sant activity are compared, the order of poten-
cy for inhibition of nmda responses [(+)-pen-
tobarbital > dmbb > (+/-)- xxxd3183xxx  > (+)-
 xxxd3183xxx  = (—)- xxxd3183xxx  >  xxxd158xxx 
> (+/-)-pentobarbital > (—)-pentobarbital >
 xxxd2569xxx  = phenobarbital >>  xxxd285xxx ]
differs from the order of potency for duration
of anesthesia [(-)- xxxd3183xxx  > (+)-secobarbi-
tal = (+/-) xxxd3183xxx  > (—)-pentobarbital >
dmbb > (+/-)pentobarbital > (+)-pentobarbi-
tal >  xxxd158xxx  >  xxxd2569xxx  = pheno-
 xxxd285xxx  >>  xxxd285xxx ]. however, it is more diffi-
cult to relate this order of potency to the anes-
thetic activity of these mixed acting barbitu-
rates for several reasons. first, they exhibit dif-
fering degrees of convulsant activity in vivo
which may nonspecifically interact with or
counteract their anesthetic activity. and for
one convulsant barbiturate, dmbb, anticon-
vulsant pretreatment was required to block
fatal seizure activity and demonstrate anes-
thetic effects; this anticonvulsant pretreatment
may also interact nonspecifically with the
anesthetic effects of these barbiturates.

barbiturates with mixed convulsant and
anesthetic effects inhibited nmda receptor
responses with an order of potency [cheb >
(+)-pentobarbital > (+)- xxxd3183xxx  = (—)-se-
cobarbital > dmbb > (-)-pentobarbital]
which differed from the order of convulsant
potency in vivo [dmbb = cheb > (+)-pento-
 xxxd285xxx  > (-)-pentobarbital > (—)- xxxd3183xxx 
> (+)- xxxd3183xxx ]. overall, these results sug-
gest that barbiturate inhibition of nmda re-
sponses may be related to the anesthetic ef-
fects of these drugs but not to their convulsant
activity.

data from this laboratory showed that the
duration of barbiturate anesthesia in vivo is
incrased by nmda receptor antagonists and
channel blockers [10, 11], supporting the role
of nmda receptors in barbiturate anesthesia.

barbiturates and nmda receptors
central administration of nmda antagonists
produced anesthesia, while nmda itself pro-
duced seizures [daniell, unpubl. data]. sub-
anesthetic doses of the noncompetitive
nmda antagonists, mk-801, phencyclidine
and ketamine, strongly potentiated the dura-
tion of anesthesia produced by pentobarbital
[10]. a competitive nmda receptor antago-
nist, cgs 19755, also increased the duration
of ethanol and pentobarbital anesthesia [11].
however, the icsq values for inhibition of
nmda responses in hippocampal microsacs
were larger than blood anesthetic concentra-
tions of anesthetic barbiturates (approximate-
ly 0.05-0.16 mmol/l for pentobarbital [24]).
therefore, it seems likely that the anesthetic
effects of barbiturates are primarily mediated
by effects on other neurotransmitter systems,
possibly non-nmda eaa receptors. in the
cerebral cortex, synaptic responses to kainate
and  xxxd3068xxx  were more potently inhibited
by pentobarbital than were responses to
nmda [25] and, in cultured hippocampal
neurons [26] and striatal neurons [27], kai-
nate responses were inhibited by pentobarbi-
tal to a greater degree than were aspartate
responses. hippocampal  xxxd3068xxx  re-
sponses were inhibited to a greater degree by
pentobarbital than were nmda responses
[3]. these results suggest that non-nmda
eaa receptors are more sensitive to inhibi-
tion by barbiturates than nmda receptors.
the convulsant barbiturates tested in this
study all exhibited anesthetic properties. the
isomers of pentobarbital and  xxxd3183xxx  also
exhibited convulsant activity, but this activity
was mild and accompanied by significant
anesthetic effects. cheb and dmbb are
much more potent convulsants than pento-
 xxxd285xxx  and  xxxd3183xxx  isomers and similar
doses of these barbiturates (50 and 75 mg/kg)
produced severe convulsions followed by
death. however, a previous study showed that
the dose-dependent anesthetic effects of

cheb can be determined after pretreatment
with a nonanesthetic dose of the anticonvul-
sant barbiturate, phenobarbital [28]. similar-
ly, in this study, the dose-dependent anesthet-
ic effects of dmbb were revealed after pre-
treatment with phenobarbital. these results
show that all of the barbiturates used in this
study have significant anesthetic effects,
which may also be accompanied by  xxxd2924xxx -
sant activity, and suggest that the anesthetic
and convulsant properties of barbiturates
may be due to activity at different neuronal
sites or receptors.

previous work examining other neuronal
signalling systems also failed to demonstrate
consistent differences between barbiturates
with and without convulsant activity. thus,
although anesthetic barbiturates increase the
conductance of brain gaba-a receptors [29],
convulsant barbiturates also increase gaba-
stimulated ion flux [30], suggesting that the
convulsant effects of barbiturates are not me-
diated by reduction of gaba-a receptor ac-
tivity. barbiturates also block voltage-sensi-
tive calcium channels [31-33]. this effect
may be related to their inhibitory effects on
depolarization-evoked neurotransmitter re-
lease [34] and their anesthetic activity. how-
ever, the convulsant barbiturate, cheb,
which has anesthetic activity as well, also
reduced voltage-sensitive calcium influx [28,
35] and depolarization-evoked neurotrans-
mitter release [34]. in other studies, the effects
of convulsant barbiturates have been con-
trasted with effects of anesthetic barbiturates.
cheb and (+)-dmbb both increased minia-
ture endplate frequency at the neuromuscular
junction [36], and cheb increased the spon-
taneous release of acetylcholine from hippo-
campal slices, but this effect was not shared by
the convulsant barbiturate, 1-methyl-5-phe-
nyl-5-propyl barbituric acid [(+)-mppb] [37].
the main factor confounding these investiga-
tions is the coexisting anesthetic activity of

305
most, ifnot all, convulsant barbiturates studied
to date. it is difficult to determine whether any
of these actions observed in vitro are in fact
related to convulsant activity of barbiturates.

pentobarbital isomers produced a greater
degree of inhibition of nmda responses at
higher agonist concentrations, indicating that
barbiturates block nmda responses in a non-
competitive manner. the nmda receptor
has a number of allosteric modulatory sites,
including sites for glycine, zinc, and poly-
amines, as well as distinct sites within the cat-
ion channel itself for mg?+ and mk-801 [38].
it is possible that barbiturates act at the mg?*
or mk-801 site on the nmda receptor. this
would be consistent with a noncompetitive
mode of antagonism of nmda responses as
these sites are located inside the cation chan-
nel of the receptor and both mg?*+ and mk-
801 are noncompetitive blockers of nuda
responses. however, further studies are
needed to determine the site of action of bar-
biturates on the nmda receptor.

earlier work showed that barbiturates alter
calcium homeostatic mechanisms, including
mitochondrial calcium transport [39, 40] and

references

 

synaptic ca-atpase activity [41, 42]. in this
study all barbiturates tested, except for seco-
 xxxd285xxx  and  xxxd285xxx , altered resting caj, but
not ina consistent manner. the concentrations
of anesthetic barbiturates required to alter rest-
ing ca; were also generally higher than those
required to inhibit nmda responses. these
results suggest that the barbiturate-stimulated
changes in resting ca; are unrelated to their
anesthetic or convulsant activity in vivo. these
results further suggest that the ability of barbi-
turates to alter resting caj is also unrelated to
their anesthetic or convulsant activity in vivo.
the mechanism of barbiturate alteration of
resting ca; remains to be elucidated but could
be due to effects on calcium homeostatic mech-
anisms as noted above.
