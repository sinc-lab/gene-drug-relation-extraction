discrimination of three opiate receptor binding sites with the use of a computerized curve-fitting technique.  the presence of different types of opiate binding sites was investigated with the use of a computerized, weighted, nonlinear least-squares regression program. the experimental data were obtained from four groups. each of three labeled opiate ligands was displaced using each of the same unlabeled ligands. the resulting nine different ligand combinations of each group were evaluated by use of a curve-fitting program. the four groups consisted of the kappa ligand ethylketocyclazocine, the sigma ligand skf 10047, and the oripavine derivatives  xxxd2070xxx  and  xxxd1913xxx , each in conjunction with the delta opiate receptor ligand (d-ala2,d- xxxg2329xxx )-enkephalin and the  xxxg1635xxx  ligand  xxxd1888xxx . the binding model which best fitted each of the four groups suggested the existence of three different binding sites in the rat brain homogenate. two of these sites conform to the previously described mu and delta sites. a third site (r3) displayed high affinity for ethylketocyclazocine, skf 10047,  xxxd2070xxx , and  xxxd1913xxx  but very low affinity for  xxxd1888xxx  and [d-ala2,d- xxxg2329xxx ]enkephalin. naloxone, cyclazocine, and dynorphin-(1--13) had high affinity for r3. behavioral data support the interpretation that the r3 site may represent a kappa site at which skf 10047 acts antagonistically.
