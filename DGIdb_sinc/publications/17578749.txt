long-term physical activity is known to increase the antioxidant defense
(aod) system, whereas sedentary lifestyle is associated with oxidative
stress (os). the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely
understood. the aim of this prospective, nonrandomized study was to
evaluate and compare the relationship between long-term physical activity and inactivity and plasma antioxidant status in female adults with
intellectual disability (id) that were diagnosed after birth.
a total of 21 adults with id were examined. the following aod was
examined: superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx),  xxxd3521xxx , and  xxxd3105xxx . inactive persons with id had
significantly lower sod (p < 0.05), cat (p < 0.05), and gpx (p < 0.05).
all plasma vitamin levels were significantly higher in physically active
subjects ( xxxd3105xxx : 1.42 ± 0.05 mmol/l,  xxxd3521xxx : 31.32 ± 2.62 mmol/l)
than in sedentary control subjects ( xxxd3105xxx : 1.02 ± 0.03 mmol/l,  xxxd3521xxx : 18.88 ± 2.23 mmol/l) p < 0.01. these results suggest that regular
physical activity is associated with preserved aods in adults with id.

introduction
physical inactivity, bed rest, and a passive lifestyle are common among
adult people with id (carmeli et al. 2003). with increased life expectancy
and improved care and awareness, the numbers of aged persons with id is
increasing steadily. the major reasons for increased life expectancy are
attributed to improvements in medical technology and in the quality of
health and social care (rimmer and braddock 2002). they have indicated
that, until recently, health promotion for adult people with id has been a
neglected area of interest on the part of the general health community. in
addition, they imply that treating the physical ailments as the primary
focus will influence positively the quality of life for this population.
regular physical activity is an important factor for disease prevention
and healthy aging (american college of sports medicine [acsm] 1998).
the human cells contain elaborate aod systems that are conventionally
classified into two categories: enzymatic and nonenzymatic, and their function depends mainly on aging and lifestyle, i.e., physical activity, dietary
intake, medications, and so on (carmeli, lavian, and reznick 2000).
high molecular weight (aos) are available in every cell where reactive
oxygen species (ros) are produced (kedziora and bartosz 1988). antioxidant enzymes in biological systems include sod, cat, gpx, and others.
the low molecular weight aos are small lipophilic or hydrophilic molecules, which include alpha- tocopherol ( xxxd3521xxx ), beta-carotene ( xxxd3105xxx ), and
others, and posses great ability to penetrate into the cells in sites undergoing
oxidative stress. the aos break free radicals chain reactions and maintain
the cellular homeostasis. unlike the high molecular ao enzymes, levels of
the low molecular nonindicible aos are not as tightly regulated and, thus,
they could be heavily influenced by physical activity or by dietary intake
and, therefore, are susceptible to deficiency (devasagayam et al. 2004).
even though regular physical activity could improve ao status (franciscojavier et al. 2006), it is not completely understood whether the body’s natural
aod system (high molecular weight–enzymes group) is sufficient to counteract the prevalence of certain diseases or whether additional supplements (low
molecular weight ao–vitamins group) are needed. the inducible aos have
demonstrated prominent adaptive responses to physical activity and aging.
(blokhina, virolainen, and fagerstedt 2003) point out that an ao defense
system is vitally important in protecting against os in aerobic tissues. in a

number of pathologies as well as in physical activity and aging, studies have
shown that aos are not sufficient to protect against excessive os, (but a
variety of aos such as vitamins a, c, and e has proved beneficial in attenuating os-associated changes (preziosi, et al. 1998; zondlo 2002).
antioxidants plasma levels are a parameter used to determine the antioxidant status. the vitamin and enzyme plasma levels, however, may not
reflect their functional status. understanding the unique characteristics of
various aos will help us develop strategies to enhance cellular ao capacity through physiological and nutritional means.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the differences of plasma total
antioxidant status, that is, vitamin and enzyme levels in active and nonactive female adults with id.
methods
the prospective, nonrandomized samples were divided to two groups:
one group comprising 11 physically active adults with id (average age ±
sd, 47.1 ± 3.5 years) and a second group comprising 10 sedentary controls with id (average age ± sd, 49.8 ± 4.3 years) recruited from the same
residential care center located in the northern part of israel.
intellectual disability was diagnosed within 1–3 years after birth by iq
scores defined by the wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence
(harcourt assessment inc., san antonio; hays, reas, and shaw 2002).
all subjects were nonmenstruating females.
to eliminate the factors that might affect free radical antioxidant activity we excluded individuals with one of the following conditions: type ii
diabetes mellitus; chronic or acute heart failure; smoking; alcohol drinking; hyperlipidaemia; taking dopamine, lithium, or glucocorticoids; and
thyroid, liver, adrenal, or kidney diseases. special care was taken to
exclude subjects who were taking anabolic drugs, vitamins, or other antioxidants, or who were smokers. none of the subjects was following a special diet, and participants were subjected to the same diet regime as
routinely served in the residential care center. a face-to-face interview
was conducted with every participant, and a detailed food frequency
questionnaire was completed in order to obtain information about her
dietary habits. the quality, quantity, and frequency of consumption of red
meat, chicken, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, dietary products, and soft
drinks were similar in all of the subjects.
after a 12-h overnight fast, and between 07:00–08:00 a.m., a total of
15 ml of venous blood samples were drawn from the medial cubital vein:
7 ml were collected into clean tubes for analyses of vitamins and into heparin-containing tubes for determination of total antioxidant potential, and
8 ml were collected for enzyme analyses. samples were maintained in

standard position, i.e., standing in a cold chamber (4°c) for 1 h until separation by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 min at 4°c, and immediately
used for routine determinations. aliquots were stored at −74°c.
this study was approved by the institutional ethic committee of residential care centers under the administrative control of the israeli ministry of welfare. written informed consent was obtained from all tested
subjects’ legal guardians/surrogates.

serum vitamin determination
serum was obtained after centrifugation at 1000×g of the blood samples
obtained as above and was stored at −74°c until use. the deep-frozen
plasma was thawed and mixed to disperse possible precipitates. the
extraction of liposoluble vitamins was carried out using n-hexane after
deproteinization with ethanol. a liposoluble vitamin ( xxxd3521xxx ) was
determined by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) in the nhexane extract of plasma after drying in a nitrogen current and redissolving in methanol. this assay allows the simultaneous determination of
vitamins a and e in serum in a single isocratic hplc run. interassay
precision is <4.5%, and intrassay precision is <3%. the hplc was a
chromosystem® with a uv detector.  xxxd3521xxx  was determined at
295 nm, and beta-carotene at 325 nm.
serum enzyme determination
determination of the antioxidant parameters sod, ca, and gpx was performed using the commercial tests manufactured by randox laboratories
ltd, uk, based on spectrophotometer determination methods. copper-and
zinc-containing sod (cuzn-sod) was determined in a haemolysate prepared from blood collected in heparin vacutainer tubes. the haemolysate
preparation for sod determination consisted of erythrocyte separation by
centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1,500 rpm, followed by washing four times
with 3 ml of 154 mmol/l nacl and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,500
rpm. after the last supernatant decantation, we followed the method of
ellman (1959) to determine the plasma thiol group and erythrocyte lysate
thiol group levels based on the thiol-disulphide interchange reaction between
2-nitrobenzoic acid and biological thiols. sod determination was performed
by using a randox test kit (randox laboratories ltd. uk, cat. no. sd 12).
catalase activity was determined by measuring the decomposition
of  xxxd2298xxx  at 240 nm, as described by aebi et al. 1974. to determine gpx, the whole blood was diluted with a dilution solution (obtained
with the test reagents) and lysed with a doubly concentrated drabkin reagent,
using a ransdox test kit (randox laboratories ltd. uk, cat. no. rs 505).

statistical analysis was carried out using spss version 12. the data
obtained are expressed as mean values (±sd). to determine whether differences between means were significant, we used the student t test and
chi-square test, with p < 0.05 taken as the significance level. bivariate
comparisons were examined using spearman correlation coefficients (r)
and values were corrected for ties.
results
the general characteristics of the subjects are presented in table 1. there
was no significant difference between the groups in bmi, weight, and
age. it is worth noting that before and during the study no differences in
diet intake between the groups were reported.
biochemical characteristics of both groups are shown in table 2. significant differences were found between the groups in the antioxidants
parameters. the mean decrease in sod, ca, and gpx activities was
28%, 26%, and 29%, respectively, versus in the active group values.

sod, ca, and gpx values in active id individuals were significantly
higher in comparison to the sedentary control group (p < 0.05). the mean
decrease values of vitamins a and e were 28% and 39%, respectively,
versus in the physically active group.
all plasma vitamin levels were significantly higher in the physically
active subjects ( xxxd3105xxx : 1.42 ± 0.05 mmol/l;  xxxd3521xxx : 31.32 ± 2.62
mmol/l) than in the sedentary control subjects ( xxxd3105xxx :1.02 ± 0.03
mmol/l ;  xxxd3521xxx : 18.88 ± 2.23 mmol/l) p < 0.01. on the other hand, all
vitamin and enzyme levels were within normal ranges.
discussion
the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may be responsible for a series of biochemical changes that occur in a someone with prolonged inactive lifestyle.
the depression in plasma activities of antioxidant capacity and the
inferior levels of free radical scavengers of high and low molecular
mass in the sedentary control group may compensate for the os caused
by an inactive lifestyle. in contrast, however, plasma antioxidants
capacities were significantly higher in the physically active group than
in controls.
 xxxd3521xxx  is transported bound to all three plasma lipoprotein fractions (volumetric, low and high-density lipoprotein, vldl, ldl, and
hdl) of humans (cynshi and stocker 2005). because of this nonspecific transport by plasma lipoproteins,  xxxd3521xxx  concentration is
greatly affected by both dietary supplementation and changes in the
lipoprotein metabolism (clarkson and thompson 2000; schroder, navarro,
and mora 2002; cha, kim, and daily 2003). plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations are affected by cholesterol levels (positively correlations),
which might be indicative of their mobilization from liver or adipose
tissue or both.
physical activity activates signal transduction pathways that in turn
might cause antioxidant mobilization. the increase in low molecular
weights aos concentrations during physical activity correlated with the
increase in high molecular weight aos. several studies have pointed out
that physical activity increased the function of the sympathetic nervous
system, which induces the release of free  xxxd2154xxx  from adipose tissue
and thus the release of vitamins a and e (machefer, groussard, and rannon
2004; rousseau, hininger, and palazetti 2004; chen and yang 2004).
it has been suggested that there is a rapid flux of these vitamins
between plasma and tissue. it is still unknown whether these adaptive
mechanisms differ in elderly and young subjects, and it can be supposed
that the endogenous antioxidant system in active elderly subjects is not

relevant for the same adaptive mechanisms as compared with that in
active young subjects (cang, hsiao, and hsuen 2003).
the association between oxidative stress and cardiopulmonary-vascular
and musculoskeletal diseases is a widely accepted fact today. generally,
inactive people are at higher risk of cardiopulmonary-vascular incidents
and even mortality because of lack of movement. we have examined
active and nonactive lifestyle-associated antioxidant processes by measuring plasma, vitamins a and e, and sod, cat, gpx activity and
plasma status in both sedentary and active men. the largest difference
was observed in the antioxidant status between sedentary and active men.
our findings indicated that regular, long-term physical activity induces
adaptive responses that confer protection against os.
physical activity in general and motor skill acquisition particularly are
required throughout life for adaptation to our daily environment and are
essential for achieving independence in many activities of daily living
(pigeon et al. 2003). the present research revealed the fact that regular physical activity showed a beneficial effect on aod system levels (avery, kaiser,
and sharman 2003; kang, lin, and yeh 2004; pincemail, lecomte, and
castiau 2000; rannel, wagner, and elmadfa 2004; sacheck and blumber
2001). the role of antioxidants in the general maintenance of homeostasis
already has been established. it is suggested, therefore, that by adopting a regularly active lifestyle, antioxidant functions should be monitored and supplemented whenever necessary to maintain the integrity of the cellular function.
