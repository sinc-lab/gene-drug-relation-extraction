1 the presence of b3-adrenoceptors and the low anity state of the b1-adrenoceptor (formerly
`putative b4-adrenoceptor') was investigated in ring preparations of rat isolated aorta preconstricted
with phenylephrine or prostaglandin f2a ( xxxd1902xxx ). relaxant responses to  xxxd2398xxx , selective b3adrenoceptor agonists (brl 37344, sr 58611a, cl 316243) and non-conventional partial agonists
(cgp 12177a, cyanopindolol,  xxxd2957xxx ) were obtained.
2 in phenylephrine-constricted, but not  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings, relaxations to  xxxd2398xxx 
showed a propranolol-resistant component.
3 in phenylephrine-constricted rings, relaxations to brl 37344 (pec50, 4.64) and sr 58611a
(pec50, 4.94) were not antagonized by the selective b3-adrenoceptor antagonist sr 59230a
(41 mm). cl 316243 (4100 mm) failed to produce relaxation. in  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings only sr
58611a produced relaxation, which was not aected by sr 59230a (43 mm).
4 non-conventional partial agonists produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted but not
 xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings. the relaxation to cgp 12177a was unaected by sr 59230a (41 mm) or
by cgp 20712a (10 mm), reported to block the low anity state of the b1-adrenoceptor.
5 b-adrenoceptor antagonists also produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted rings with an
order of potency of (pec50 values):  xxxd384xxx  (5.5)&sr 59230a (5.47)&cyanopindolol

59230a (10 mm) produced no relaxation in  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings.
6 these results provide no evidence for the presence of functional b3-adrenoceptors or the low
anity state of the b1-adrenoceptor in rat aorta.

introduction
the term `atypical' has been used extensively to describe badrenoceptors not corresponding pharmacologically to the
b1/-b2-classi®cation. it is now known that `atypical' badrenoceptors correspond to b3-adrenoceptors and to the
low anity state of b1-adrenoceptors (formerly `putative b4adrenoceptors'). the pharmacological properties of these
receptors are now well established (arch & kaumann, 1993;
kaumann, 1997). b3-adrenoceptors are pharmacologically
characterized by (i) low anity of classical b-adrenoceptor
antagonists, such as propranolol, (ii) activation by selective
b3-adrenoceptor agonists, such as brl 37344 (arch et al.,
1984), sr 58611a (bianchetti & manara, 1990) and cl
316243 (bloom et al., 1992), (iii) activation by nonconventional partial agonists (potent b1/b2-adrenoceptor
antagonists with b3-adrenoceptor agonist activity at higher
concentrations (kaumann, 1989)) such as cgp 12177a
(mohell & dicker, 1989), cyanopindolol (engel et al., 1981)
and  xxxd2957xxx  (walter et al., 1984), (iv) blockade by selective
b3-adrenoceptor antagonists such as sr 59230a (manara et

al., 1996). a fourth subtype of b-adrenoceptor, the `putative
b4-adrenoceptor' was also postulated to exist in the heart,
sharing properties (i) and (iii) above, but not (ii) and (iv)
(kaumann, 1989; malinowska & schlicker, 1996; kaumann
& molenaar, 1996; galitzky et al., 1997). however, the
pharmacology of the `putative b4-adrenoceptor' is not seen in
b1-adrenoceptor knockout mice (konkar et al., 2000;
kaumann et al., 2001) and it is now understood that this
receptor corresponds to a low-anity state of the b1adrenoceptor (kompa & summers, 1999; konkar et al.,
2000; kaumann et al., 2001).
vascular b-adrenoceptors were originally classi®ed as b2(lands et al., 1967) although b1-adrenoceptors also mediate
vasorelaxation (o'donnell & wanstall, 1985). a number of
recent studies have also suggested the presence of atypical badrenoceptors, i.e. b3-adrenoceptors or `putative b4-adrenoceptors' in blood vessels. for example, b3-adrenoceptor
agonists have been shown to have peripheral vasodilator
eects in dogs (tavernier et al., 1992; shen et al., 1994; 1996),
rats (shen et al., 1996) and in mice (rohrer et al., 1999). b3adrenoceptor agonists have also been shown to have
vasorelaxant properties in vitro (oriowo, 1994; 1995; sooch

n. brahmadevara et al

& marshall, 1997; tamaoki et al., 1998; macdonald et al.,
1999; sha®ei & mahmoudian, 1999; trochu et al., 1999;
brawley et al., 2000). the eects of the b3-adrenoceptor
agonists, however, may not all be mediated via b3adrenoceptors. for example, oriowo (1995) found that the
relaxations to brl 37344 and cgp 12177a in rat aorta and
carotid artery were not desensitized by brl 37344 or
antagonized by cyanopindolol, a b3-adrenoceptor antagonist
in the gastrointestinal tract (blue et al., 1989; mclaughlin &
macdonald, 1990; 1991), in contrast to the well-characterized
b3-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations of colon and fundus.
sha®ei & mahmoudian (1999) found that relaxations to
cyanopindolol in rat aorta were not blocked by sr 59230a
and suggested that the eects of non-conventional partial
agonists in rat aorta may be mediated via the `putative b4adrenoceptor'. brawley et al. (2000) also found that
relaxations to brl 37344 and cgp 12177a were not
blocked by the selective b3-adrenoceptor antagonist sr
59230a and similarly suggested the presence of the `putative
b4-adrenoceptor'. however the latter authors conceded that
not all of their data supported this conclusion since, ®rstly,
the putative b4-adrenoceptor is not activated by selective b3agonists (kaumann, 1997) and secondly, the order of potency
obtained for cyanopindolol and cgp 12177a (cyanopindolol4cgp 12177a) was the wrong way round for the cardiac
`putative b4-adrenoceptor' (kaumann & molenaar, 1996;
malinowska & schlicker, 1996). in contrast to these studies,
trochu et al. (1999) reported that relaxations to sr 58611a
in rat aorta were mediated via b3-adrenoceptors since they
were antagonized by sr 59230a. thus there is con¯icting
evidence for the presence of b3-adrenoceptors and/or the low
anity state of the b1-adrenoceptor (`putative b4-adrenoceptor') in rat aorta.
the aim of the present study was to investigate further the
nature of the relaxations mediated by b3-adrenoceptor
agonists and by non-conventional partial agonists in rat
isolated aorta. an important aspect of the study was the
choice of preconstrictor. the most commonly employed
preconstrictors for investigation of b-adrenoceptor-mediated
relaxation are a1-adrenoceptor agonists. the possibility that
relaxant eects of b3-adrenoceptor agonists or non-conventional partial agonists were due to non-speci®c blockade of
a1-adrenoceptors or interference with the a1-adrenoceptor
signalling pathway was investigated by additionally employing a preconstrictor with a dierent mechanism, prostaglandin f2a ( xxxd1902xxx ). preliminary accounts of these results have
been presented to the british pharmacological society
(brahmadevara et al., 2001; 2002).

methods
male wistar rats (200 ± 250 g) were stunned and killed by
cervical dislocation followed by exsanguination. the thoracic
aorta was isolated, removed carefully to prevent endothelium
damage and cleared of fat and connective tissue. in some
experiments, distal colon was also removed.

thoracic aorta
aortae were cut into 3 mm ring segments and mounted on
stainless steel wires in 20 ml organ baths containing krebs'

medium with the following composition in (mm): nacl 19,
kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, nahco3 25, kh2po4 1.2,
d-glucose 11.1. the krebs' medium also contained ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid (30 mm) and  xxxd228xxx  (30 mm).
the medium was maintained at 378c and gassed continuously with 95% o2 and 5% co2. each tissue was placed
under 1.5 g resting tension and equilibrated for 60 min prior
to the execution of experimental protocols. during this
period tissues were washed with krebs every 15 min and
tension was readjusted to 1.5 g. isometric muscle tension was
recorded with grass transducers and displayed on a goerz
servogor 400 oscillograph.
phenylephrine and  xxxd1902xxx  produced concentration-dependent contractions of aortic rings (pec50s: 6.90+0.03, n=8;
5.45+0.01, n=7, respectively) from which sub-maximal
concentration of phenylephrine (0.6 mm, approximately
ec80) and  xxxd1902xxx  (3 mm, approximately ec50) were chosen
for subsequent experiments. after the equilibration period,
artery rings were constricted with phenylephrine (10 mm)
twice or  xxxd1902xxx  (10 mm) followed by washout for 30 min.
functional endothelium was checked by the presence of at
least 80% relaxation in response to acetylcholine (1 mm) after
pre-constricting the tissues with a sub-maximal concentration
of phenylephrine (0.6 mm) or a sub-maximal concentration of
 xxxd1902xxx  (3 mm). in some experiments endothelium was
denuded by gentle abrasion of the intimal surface of the
aortic rings with the tip of a stainless steel wire. endothelium
removal was con®rmed by the absence of relaxation to
acetylcholine (1 mm). after washout, some tissues were
incubated with the appropriate antagonist for 30 min with
control tissues receiving vehicle treatment. the rings were
then contracted again with phenylephrine (0.6 mm) or  xxxd1902xxx 
(3 mm) and cumulative concentration-response curves to
relaxants were obtained following stabilization of constrictor-induced tone. in experiments with  xxxd1902xxx , tissues were
incubated with  xxxd3000xxx  (0.75 mm) to block a1-adrenoceptors
when  xxxd2398xxx  was used as a relaxant.

distal colon
longitudinal segments (c. 2.5 cm) of distal colon were
mounted in organ baths containing krebs' medium (composition and conditions as described above), with care taken not
to occlude the lumen. each tissue was placed under 1 g
resting tension and equilibrated for 40 min prior to
contraction with 50 mm kcl for 15 min followed by a
30 min wash. tissues were again contracted with a submaximal concentration of kcl (30 mm) and washed for
30 min. tissues were then incubated with the appropriate
antagonist for 30 min with control tissues receiving vehicle
treatment. the tissues were then contracted again with kcl
(30 mm) and cumulative concentration-response curves to
relaxants were obtained, after contraction was stabilized.

the ®nal concentration of dmso in the organ baths was
0.06%. at this concentration the solvent alone had no eect
on the tissues.

calculations and statistical analysis
responses to relaxants were calculated as percentage of
inhibition of the constrictor-induced contraction and expressed as mean+s.e.mean. mean concentration response
curves to relaxants were analysed by ®tting to a four
parameter logistic equation (given below) using non-linear
regression (graph pad prism),

where x is the logarithm of molar concentration of the
relaxant, y is the response and p is the hill slope. rmax and
pec50 values were obtained where rmax is the maximum
percentage of relaxation obtained and ec50 is the concentration (m) of relaxant that produces 50% of its maximum
response. concentration ratios (r) were determined from
ec50 values and antagonist anities were expressed as pkb
values using the following equation (schild, 1949):

statistical analyses were performed using student's t-test to
compare two groups and one-way analysis of variance
followed by the tukey multiple comparison post test for
comparison of three or more groups. p50.05 was considered
to be signi®cant.

results
 xxxd2398xxx  in phenylephrine-constricted rings
 xxxd2398xxx  produced a concentration-dependent, full relaxation of phenylephrine-constricted rings (figure 1). the b1/b2adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (30 nm, 0.3 mm and
1 mm) caused rightward shifts of the  xxxd2398xxx  concentration-response curve with no reduction in the maximum
response (figure 1a, table 1) and no signi®cant dierence in
hill slopes (p40.05). a higher concentration of propranolol
(3 mm) produced a small reduction in the maximum relaxation

1a, table 1). the corresponding schild plot, using concentrations of propranolol up to 1 mm, gave a slope of 0.42 (95% cl:
0.24 to 0.60), signi®cantly dierent from unity (n=24,
p50.05) (figure 1b). calculation of pkb values for each
individual propranolol concentration showed that the higher
concentrations (0.3, 1 and 3 mm) caused reduced rightward
shifts compared to the lower concentration (30 nm) indicating
a propranolol resistant component (table 1).

selective b3-agonists in phenylephrine-constricted rings
brl 37344 and sr 58611a produced concentrationdependent, full relaxation of phenylephrine-constricted rings
(table 2, figure 2a). cl 316243 (30 nm to 100 mm) had no
relaxant eect (n=14, figure 2a). even at a lower
constrictor concentration of phenylephrine of 0.1 mm,
approximately the ec50, cl 316243 (4100 mm) had no
relaxant eect (n=7). the relaxations to brl 37344 and sr
58611a took up to 8 and 6 min respectively to reach a
plateau. relaxations to these compounds were unaected by
propranolol (0.3 or 1 mm) or sr 59230a (41 mm) (table 2).

higher than 1 mm indicated that these concentrations reduced
the level of pre-constriction (see below).  xxxd384xxx , which
also blocks b3-adrenoceptors at mm concentrations, could not
be tested as it also depressed the phenylephrine constriction
at these concentrations.

non-conventional partial agonists in
phenylephrine-constricted rings
the non-conventional partial agonists, cgp 12177a, cyanopindolol and  xxxd2957xxx  also produced concentration-dependent
full relaxation of phenylephrine-constricted rings (table 2,
figure 2b). relaxations to cgp 12177a or to  xxxd2957xxx  were
unaected by propranolol (1 mm). relaxations to cgp
12177a were unaected by sr 59230a (41 mm) or cpg
20712a (410 mm) (table 2).

of  xxxd384xxx  was unaltered by propranolol (1 mm) (table

effect of  xxxd2398xxx  in  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings
 xxxd2398xxx  produced a concentration-dependent relaxation
of  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings (pec50, 7.42+0.04, rmax, %,

b3-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in rat colon
in order to con®rm potency and selectivity of b3-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, experiments were carried out
in distal colon, a tissue known to contain b3-adrenoceptors
(mclaughlin & macdonald, 1990). selective b3-adrenoceptor
agonists brl 37344 and cl 316243 produced concentrationdependent relaxation of kcl (30 mm)-contracted distal colon
at low concentrations (pec50 values: brl 37344, 8.11+0.02,
n=6; cl 316243, 8.40+0.02, n=5) (figure 3). relaxations
took up to 25 min and 20 min to reach a plateau to brl
37344 and cl 316243 respectively. pre-incubation with sr
59230a (1 mm) produced 93 and 99 fold shifts of the brl
37344 and cl 316243 concentration-response curves respec-

discussion
a characteristic pharmacological property of both b3adrenoceptors and the low anity state of b1-adrenoceptors
is resistance to blockade by propranolol (arch & kaumann,
1993; kaumann, 1997). in the present study, relaxations to
 xxxd2398xxx  in phenylephrine-constricted arteries were inhibited by propranolol in a non-competitive manner, with a
propranolol-resistant component of the response, con®rming
previous observations in blood vessels (oriowo, 1994; 1995;
sooch & marshall, 1997; brawley et al., 2000). the shift
produced by 30 nm propranolol (pkb, 8.64) is consistent with
an action of  xxxd2398xxx  at b1-/b2-subtypes (pa2 8.2 to 8.8,
wilson et al., 1984). higher concentrations of propranolol
produced smaller than expected shifts, indicating the
appearance of a propranolol-resistant component at higher
concentrations of  xxxd2398xxx . this propranolol-resistant
component to  xxxd2398xxx  has been taken as evidence of
vascular `atypical' b-adrenoceptors (oriowo, 1994; 1995;
sooch & marshall, 1997; sha®ei & mahmoudian, 1999;
brawley et al., 2000). however, in the present study no
evidence for a propranolol-resistant component was found in
the  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings. it appears therefore that the
apparent propranolol-resistance in phenylephrine-constricted
rings is constrictor-dependent. the reason for an apparent
propranolol-resistant component in phenylephrine-constricted, but not  xxxd1902xxx -constricted preparations, is not clear,
but as most of the other studies using blood vessels in vitro
employ either noradrenaline or phenylephrine as the
constrictor then further studies with alternative constrictors
are required.

a second characteristic property of b3-adrenoceptors, but
not the low anity state of b1-adrenoceptors, is activation by
selective b3-adrenoceptor agonists (kaumann, 1997). in the
present study relaxations in phenylephrine-constricted rings
to the selective b3-adrenoceptor agonists brl 37344 and sr
58611a were obtained, although rings failed to relax to cl
316243. relaxation to selective b3-adrenoceptor agonists has
been taken as evidence of the presence of b3-adrenoceptors in
blood vessels (sooch & marshall, 1997; tamaoki et al., 1998;
macdonald et al., 1999; trochu et al., 1999). however, in
contrast to the colon where b3-adrenoceptors are known to
be present (mclaughlin & macdonald, 1990), the relaxations
to brl 37344 occurred only with low potency (pec50s:
aorta, 4.64; colon, 8.11). the low potency of b3-adrenoceptor
agonists in rat aorta in this study is in agreement with that
found in other studies in the same organ (oriowo, 1995;
sooch & marshall, 1997; trochu et al., 1999; brawley et al.,
2000). the relaxations were also dierent in nature from
those seen in the colon, where the relaxations are slow. in
addition, the selective b3-adrenoceptor antagonist sr 59230a
failed to antagonize brl 37344 or sr 58611a-induced
relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted aorta at a concentration (1 mm) that produced more than 90 fold shifts of brl
37344 and cl 316243 in the colon. the pkb values obtained

`atypical' b-adrenoceptors in rat aorta?

in colon (7.96 and 7.97 against brl 37344 and cl 316243
respectively) are in agreement with the reported pa2 for sr
59230a against brl 37344 at b3-adrenoceptors in rabbit
jejunum (pa2, 7.58, macdonald & watt, 1999). the lack of
eect of sr 59230a on sr 58611a-induced relaxation is in
contrast to the results of trochu et al. (1999) who showed
that sr 59230a (10 mm) abolished sr 58611a-induced
relaxation and reported that a lower concentration (1 mm)
reduced the relaxation. in the present study, we were unable
to use concentrations of sr 59230a higher than 1 mm since
they reduced the size of the phenylephrine constriction (see
later). for the same reason, we were unable to use
 xxxd384xxx  as a b3-adrenoceptor antagonist since it reduced
the size of the phenylephrine constriction at concentrations
reported to block b3-adrenoceptors (kaumann & molenaar,
1996). thus the low potency of brl 37344 and sr 58611a
and the lack of antagonism of their relaxant eects by sr
59230a support the conclusion that the relaxations induced
by brl 37344 and sr 58611a in phenylephrine-constricted
aortic rings do not appear to be mediated by b3adrenoceptors. the absence of b3-adrenoceptors is supported
by the lack of any relaxant eect in phenylephrine-constricted
rings of cl 316243, whose potency and b3-selectivity (bloom
et al., 1992; kaumann & molenaar, 1996) was con®rmed in
the colon in the present study (pec50, 8.4). further evidence
for the lack of b3-adrenoceptors was provided by the
experiments in  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings. in these rings the
selective b3-adrenoceptor agonists brl 37344 and cl 316243
has no relaxant eects although  xxxd2398xxx  produced
relaxation with only a small dierence in potency from
phenylephrine-constricted rings. sr 58611a did produce
relaxation in  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings, which was not
prevented by the selective b3-adrenoceptor antagonist, sr
59230a, or by mm concentrations of  xxxd384xxx  or
 xxxd123xxx , both reported to block b3-adrenoceptors at these
concentrations (kaumann & molenaar, 1996; blue et al.,
1990).
a characteristic property of both b3-adrenoceptors and
the low anity state of b1-adrenoceptors is activation by
non-conventional partial agonists. the non-conventional
partial agonists, cgp 12177a, cyanopindolol and  xxxd2957xxx 
also relaxed phenylephrine-constricted rings. relaxation to
cgp 12177a in blood vessels has been quoted as evidence
for the presence of b3-adrenoceptors or `atypical' badrenoceptors (oriowo, 1994; 1995; trochu et al., 1999;
brawley et al., 2000). the relaxations to cgp 12177a were
unaected by the selective b3-adrenoceptor agonist sr
59230a, in agreement with a previous study (brawley et
al., 2000) and in agreement with the present results with b3adrenoceptor agonists (see above). relaxations to cgp
12177a were not blocked with cgp 20712a (3 and 10 mm),
which is reported to block the low anity state of the b1adrenoceptor at high concentrations (kaumann & molenaar, 1996; galitzky et al., 1997; malinowska & schlicker,
1997). this is in disagreement with our previous study in
noradrenaline-constricted rat aorta where cgp 20712a
antagonized the eects of cgp 12177a (brawley et al.,
2000). the reasons for the dierent results are not clear but
as the antagonism reported was clearly not simply
competitive, then some other factors may have contributed
to the results. the functional absence of the low anity
state of the b1-adrenoceptor was con®rmed in this study by

n. brahmadevara et al

a complete lack of relaxant eect of cgp 12177a and
cyanopindolol in  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings.
it was reported previously that removal of endothelium
attenuates the relaxant response of the b3-adrenoceptor
agonist sr 58611a, leading to the conclusion that b3adrenoceptors are located on endothelial cells (trochu et
al., 1999). in the present study, endothelium removal had
little or no eect on the relaxations obtained to sr 58611a
and cgp 12177a in phenylephrine-constricted rings. thus
the `non-speci®c' relaxant eect of sr 58611a and cgp
12177a in phenylephrine-constricted rings is not endothelium-dependent.
since preliminary experiments had shown that the badrenoceptor antagonists sr 59230a and  xxxd384xxx  at mm
concentrations could depress phenylephrine constrictions, we
considered whether the relaxant eect of the non-conventional
partial agonists was shared by other b-adrenoceptor antagonists. all of the b-adrenoceptor antagonists tested produced
relaxation of phenylephrine-constricted rings (order of potency:  xxxd384xxx %sr 59230a%cyanopindolol4pindolol4
alprenolol4propranolol4ici 1185514cgp 12177a%cgp
20712a) (figure 2, tables 2 and 4). in contrast, in pgf2aconstricted rings no relaxation was seen with the b-adrenoceptor antagonists tested ( xxxd384xxx ,  xxxd123xxx , propranolol,
sr 59230a). thus all of the b-adrenoceptor antagonists tested,
including the non-conventional partial agonists, produce
relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted but not  xxxd1902xxx -constricted rings, supporting the conclusion that the relaxant
eects of the non-conventional partial agonists is not related to
their agonist activity at b3-adrenoceptors or at the low anity
state of the b1-adrenoceptor. the fact that the relaxant eects

occur in phenylephrine-constricted but not  xxxd1902xxx -constricted
arteries suggests some interference with the a1-adrenoceptor
signalling pathway, possibly a1-adrenoceptor blocking activity.
these results suggest that phenylephrine is not a suitable
constrictor for investigation of b3- or low anity state of b1adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation.
in conclusion, although some b3-adrenoceptor agonists and
the non-conventional partial agonists produce relaxation in
phenylephrine-constricted rat aorta, the relaxation is unrelated to stimulation of b3-adrenoceptors or to the low
anity state of the b1-adrenoceptor. the selective b3adrenoceptor agonists brl 37344 and sr 58611a appear
to mediate eects in rat aorta other than those previously
reported at b3-adrenoceptors. cl 316243 lacks these eects
and thus may be a suitable agonist for investigation of b3adrenoceptors in blood vessels. b-adrenoceptor antagonists,
including the non-conventional partial agonists, relax phenylephrine-constricted but not  xxxd1902xxx -constricted arteries,
suggesting interference with the a1-adrenoceptor signalling
pathway. these results provide no evidence for the presence
of functional b3-adrenoceptors or the low anity state of the
b1-adrenoceptor in rat isolated aorta and it is suggested that
phenylephrine is an unsuitable constrictor for investigation of
these receptors in blood vessels.
