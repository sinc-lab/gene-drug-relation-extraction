abstract
prourokinase-induced plasminogen activation is complex and involves three distinct reactions: (1) plasminogen
activation by the intrinsic activity of prourokinase; (2) prourokinase activation by plasmin ; (3) plasminogen activation by
urokinase. to further understand some of the mechanisms involved, the effects of epsilon- xxxd146xxx  acid ( xxxd146xxx ), a
lysine analogue, on these reactions were studied. at a low range of concentrations (10^50 wm),  xxxd146xxx  significantly
inhibited prourokinase-induced (glu-/lys-) plasminogen activation, prourokinase activation by lys-plasmin, and (glu-/
lys-) plasminogen activation by urokinase. however, no inhibition of plasminogen activation by ala158 -prourokinase (a
plasmin-resistant mutant) occurred. therefore, the overall inhibition of  xxxd146xxx  on prourokinase-induced plasminogen
activation was mainly due to inhibition of reactions 2 and 3, by blocking the high-affinity lysine binding interaction
between plasmin and prourokinase, as well as between plasminogen and urokinase. these findings were consistent with
kinetic studies which suggested that binding of kringle 1^4 of plasmin to the n-terminal region of prourokinase
significantly promotes prourokinase activation, and that binding of kringle 1^4 of plasminogen to the c-terminal lysine158
of urokinase significantly promotes plasminogen activation. in conclusion,  xxxd146xxx  was found to inhibit, rather than
promote, prourokinase-induced plasminogen activation due to its blocking of the high-affinity lysine binding sites on
plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ). ß 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

the zymogen plasminogen is a multi-domain glycoprotein consisting of an amino terminal peptide,
¢ve homologous kringle domains (kringle 1^5) and
a trypsin like  xxxg745xxx  domain [1,2]. plasminogen is activated to plasmin by speci¢c cleavage of
the arg561 ^val562 peptide bond by plasminogen activators [3] including tissue plasminogen activator

( xxxg1766xxx ) [4^6], urokinase (uk) [7^9] and prourokinase
(pro-uk) [10,11]. whereas the enzymology of t-paor uk-induced plasminogen activation is well established, that of pro-uk is complex and less well
understood.
pro-uk is a single chain zymogen plasminogen
activator which has an intrinsic activity against plasminogen and is itself activated to uk by plasmin by
cleavage of the lys158 ^ile159 peptide bond [12]. this
feedback activation means that plasmin generation
by pro-uk is the integrated consequence of three
distinct reactions: (1) activation of plasminogen to
plasmin by the intrinsic activity of prourokinase;
(2) activation of prourokinase to urokinase by plasmin; (3) activation of plasminogen to plasmin by
urokinase. the molecular interactions among these
proteins, particularly the non-catalytic interactions,
are not well understood. therefore, in the present
study, these reactions were investigated using miniplasmin( xxxd2046xxx ), a low-molecular-weight mutant of
pro-uk/uk, a plasmin resistant mutant of pro-uk
(ala158 -pro-uk) and  xxxd146xxx  to evaluate the roles of
these interactions in pro-uk-induced plasminogen
activation.
there are two classes of  xxxd146xxx  binding sites on
glu-plasminogen, the native form of the molecule, a
single strong lysine binding site with a dissociation
constant (kd ) of 9 wm and ¢ve weaker sites with a
kd of 5 mm [13]. on lys-plasminogen, probably also
on lys-plasmin, there is one strong  xxxd146xxx  binding
site of kd 18^35 wm, a slightly weaker site of kd 260
wm, and four much weaker sites of average kd 10
mm [13,14]. saturating the weak binding sites of
glu-plasminogen by  xxxd146xxx  induces a conformation
transition to an open or lys-plasminogen-like shape
[15^19]. this results in an acceleration of glu-plasminogen activation by  xxxg1766xxx  and uk. occupation by
 xxxd146xxx  of the strong binding site on glu-plasminogen does not have this e¡ect [16^18]. for this reason,
the function of the strong lysine-binding site on gluplasminogen is readily overlooked.
it was previously reported that in the presence of
cl3 , pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation
was signi¢cantly promoted by  xxxd146xxx  [20]. however,
in that study, only one high  xxxd146xxx  concentration
(2.0 mm) was tested. in the present study, a range
of concentrations of  xxxd146xxx  (0^10 mm) in pro-ukinduced plasminogen activation was studied to eval-

183

uate the roles of both the higher and lower a⁄nity
binding sites. we found that the net e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx 
on pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation was
inhibition rather than promotion. when the mechanism of this inhibition was studied, it was found to
be due mainly to the e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk
activation by plasmin and on plasminogen activation
by uk. in addition, the binding of plasmin kringle
1^4 to the n-terminal region (ser1 ^lys135 ) of prouk, containing an egf and kringle domain, signi¢cantly promoted pro-uk activation by plasmin, and
the binding of plasminogen kringle 1^4 to the c-terminal lysine of uk promoted plasminogen activation
by uk. these binding iterations were also prevented by low concentrations of  xxxd146xxx  and presumably mediated by the high-a⁄nity lysine binding
site located in kringle 1^4 of plasmin and plasminogen.

2. materials and methods
recombinant pro-uk and a low-molecular-mass
mutant, v125-pro-uk missing the egf and kringle
domains, were obtained from farmitalia carlo erba
(milan, italy). two-chain uk and v125-uk were
made by plasmin treatment of their single chain precursors as described previously [21]. a plasmin-resistant mutant of recombinant pro-uk constructed by
site-directed mutagenesis with a substitution of
lys158 to ala158 (ala158 -pro-uk), was a gift from
collaborative research inc. (bedford, ma). human
glu-plasminogen and lys-plasminogen were puri¢ed
from diisopropyl £uorophosphate (dfp) treated
bank plasma essentially by the method of castellino
and powell [16]. mini-plasminogen and kringle 1^3
fragment of plasminogen were obtained by digesting
plasminogen with a catalytic amount of porcine pancreatic elastase and puri¢ed as described previously
[22]. mini-plasminogen and kringle 1^3 fragment
were treated with dfp before use. lys-plasmin and
mini-plasmin were produced from plasminogen and
mini-plasminogen respectively by using immobilized
uk. chromogenic substrates, s2444 and s2251, were
obtained from kabi (franklin, oh). immobilized
 xxxg502xxx  (cpb) was purchased from calbiochem (san diego, ca).  xxxd146xxx  was obtained from
sigma (st. louis, mo).

2.1. e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk, v125-pro-uk and
ala158 -pro-uk-induced plasminogen activation
in the absence or presence of  xxxd146xxx , the time-absorbance curves of pro-uk, v125-pro-uk and
ala158 -pro-uk-induced plasminogen activation were
determined by measuring the optical density (od)
increase in the reaction mixture with time at 405
nm on a microtiter plate reader as previously described [10]. the reaction mixture contained s2251
(1.5 mm),  xxxd146xxx  (0^10 mm), plasminogen (1.0
wm for glu-plasminogen, 0.2 wm for lys-plasminogen and mini-plasminogen), and pro-uk (0.5 nm),
v125-pro-uk (2.0 nm) or ala158 -pro-uk (10 nm) in
the assay bu¡er (50 mm tris^hcl, 0.1 m nacl,

temperature.

reader.
2.4. e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  and kringle 1^3 fragment on
pro-uk and v125-pro-uk activation by
lys-plasmin and mini-plasmin
pro-uk or v125-pro-uk (0.2 wm) was incubated
with lys-plasmin or mini-plasmin (0.1 nm) and
s2444 (1.2 mm) in the presence of  xxxd146xxx  (0^10
mm) or kringle 1^3 fragment (0^2.0 wm). the od
increase in the reaction mixture with time at 405 nm
was measured with a microtiter plate reader.
2.5. kinetic studies of plasminogen (glu-, lys- and
mini-) activation by uk, v125-uk and
cpb-pretreated uk in the absence or presence
of  xxxd146xxx 

to evaluate a direct inhibition by  xxxd146xxx  on the
catalytic activity of plasmin, the amidolytic activities
of lys-plasmin (5.0 nm) and mini-plasmin (5.0 nm)
against s2251 (1.2 mm) were assayed in the presence
and absence of  xxxd146xxx  (0^50 mm).
the e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on the amidolytic activities of
uk and v125-uk were also studied. brie£y, a range
of concentrations of s2444 (0.18, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8,
2.4 mm) was incubated with uk or v125-uk (4.0
nm) in the absence or presence of  xxxd146xxx  (10, 25, 50,
100 mm) in assay bu¡er at room temperature. the
reaction rate was measured by the linear od increase
with time at 405 nm on a microtiter plate reader. the
michaelis constant (km ), catalytic rate constant (kcat )
and inhibition constant (ki ) were determined with a
computerized program (enz¢tter; elsevier biosoft,
cambridge, uk).

in the absence of  xxxd146xxx , a range of concentrations of (glu-, lys- and mini-) plasminogen (1.0,
1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 wm) was incubated with
uk, v125-uk or cpb-pretreated uk (0.05 nm)
and s2251 (1.2 mm) in the assay bu¡er at room
temperature. plasminogen activation rate was calculated by the od increase with the time square (t2 ) at
405 nm [10]. the michaelis constant (km ) and catalytic rate constant (kcat ) were determined from lineweaver^burk plots with enz¢tter program.
in the presence of  xxxd146xxx , time-absorbance curves
of plasminogen activation at room temperature were
obtained by measuring the od increase in the reaction mixture with time at 405 nm. the reaction mixture contained s2251 (1.2 mm), glu- or lys-plasminogen (4.0 wm and 8.0 wm), uk (0.05 nm), and
 xxxd146xxx  (0^10 mm). the km and kcat were calculated
as previously described [10].

activation by lys-plasmin and mini-plasmin in

glu-plasminogen, lys-plasminogen or mini-plasminogen (0.2 wm) was incubated with uk, v125uk, cpb-pretreated uk or cpb-pretreated v125uk (0.1 nm) and s2251 (1.2 mm) in the presence
of  xxxd146xxx  (0^10 mm) or kringle 1^3 fragment (0^8.0

a range of concentrations of pro-uk or v125-prouk (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0 wm) was incubated with lys-plasmin or mini-plasmin (0.1 nm)
and s2444 (1.2 mm) in the absence or presence of

perature. the same range of concentrations of prouk or v125-pro-uk without plasmin was incubated
with s2444 as background. the apparent od
(odapp ) increase in the reaction mixture was measured at 405 nm. the actual od (odact ) was calibrated with odapp divided by (km;s2444 +[s2444])/
{km;s2444 (1+[i]/ki )+[s2444]}, where km;s2444 is michaelis constant of uk against s2444, [s2444] is
the concentration of s2444, [i] is the concentration
of  xxxd146xxx , ki is the competitive inhibition constant
of  xxxd146xxx  against amidolytic activity of uk. the
pro-uk activation rate was calculated by the odact
increase with the time square (t2 ) as previously described [10].

3. results and discussion
three distinct reactions are involved in the reciprocal activation of plasminogen and pro-uk:

ðreaction 1þ

ðreaction 2þ

ðreaction 3þ
the chain reactions are triggered by the intrinsic activity of pro-uk which is substantially higher (0.1^
0.4% that of uk) than those of other protease zymogens [21,23]. after plasminogen activation has been
initiated by pro-uk, plasmin induces the conversion
of pro-uk to uk, and then uk catalyzes more
rapid plasmin generation. factors which change the
rate of any one of the three reactions will a¡ect net
plasmin generation. plasminogen activation by prouk and uk is a¡ected by certain ¢brin fragments
[10,11,24], synthetic peptides [25,26], and plasmin ac-

185

tivation of pro-uk is also modulated by  xxxg1768xxx 
[27,28].
by inducing an open conformation in glu-plasminogen,  xxxd146xxx  can promote plasminogen activation by plasminogen activators, including uk or
plasmin resistant pro-uk [10].  xxxd146xxx  also has an
anti¢brinolytic e¡ect which is related to its inhibition
of the binding of plasminogen and plasmin with ¢brin [29,30]. this property is used clinically for the
treatment of certain hemorrhagic conditions [30,31].
3.1. e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk, v125-pro-uk and
ala158 -pro-uk-induced plasminogen activation
(total e¡ect and reaction 1)
a signi¢cant inhibition of pro-uk-induced gluplasminogen (fig. 1a) or lys-plasminogen (fig.
1b) activation occurred in the presence of  xxxd146xxx .
in the case of lys-plasminogen, inhibition by
 xxxd146xxx  occurred in a single-phase dose-dependent
manner. by contrast, the inhibition of glu-plasminogen activation by  xxxd146xxx  was separable into three
phases depending on  xxxd146xxx  concentration. from
0.01 mm to 0.25 mm,  xxxd146xxx  inhibited pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation in a dose-dependent manner. from 0.25 mm to 5.0 mm,  xxxd146xxx 
promoted pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation, consistent with its induction of an open conformation in glu-plasminogen. however, the overall
activation rate of glu-plasminogen in the presence
of 0.25^5.0 mm  xxxd146xxx  was still much lower than
that in the absence of  xxxd146xxx . the third phase was
found when  xxxd146xxx  concentration was above 5.0
mm, and the generation of plasmin was inhibited
in an  xxxd146xxx  dose-dependent manner, probably due
to a direct inhibition of the active site of uk by
 xxxd146xxx  (see below).
by contrast,  xxxd146xxx  caused only slight inhibition
of pro-uk-induced mini-plasminogen activation
(data not shown), suggesting that the kringle 1^4 of
plasminogen was involved in the inhibitory e¡ect of
 xxxd146xxx .
ala158 -pro-uk, a plasmin resistant mutant (which
has the same intrinsic activity as wild-type pro-uk
[11]), was used to investigate the e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on
the intrinsic activity of pro-uk against plasminogen
(reaction 1).  xxxd146xxx  had little e¡ect on lys-plasmin

 xxxd2046xxx  activation by ala158 -pro-uk [10]. the e¡ect on
glu-plasminogen activation was separable into two
phases (fig. 1c). when the concentration of  xxxd146xxx 
was below 5.0 mm,  xxxd146xxx  promoted ala158 -pro-uk
activation of glu-plasminogen in a dose-dependent
manner, but above 5.0 mm, the promoting e¡ect of
 xxxd146xxx  decreased as the  xxxd146xxx  concentration increased. these results indicated that the overall inhibition of  xxxd146xxx  on (wild-type) pro-uk-induced
plasminogen activation was not related to its e¡ect
on reaction 1.
to investigate the roles of the egf and kringle
domain of pro-uk, v125-pro-uk was used. when
the  xxxd146xxx  concentration was between 1.0 mm to 5.0
mm, v125-pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation was promoted by  xxxd146xxx  in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 1d). however, when the  xxxd146xxx  concentration was below 0.5 mm, a slight inhibition was
seen. these results suggested that the n-terminal region of pro-uk was involved in the inhibitory e¡ect
of  xxxd146xxx .
in summary,  xxxd146xxx  caused no inhibition of reaction 1. both the kringle 1^4 of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ) and
n-terminal region of pro-uk were involved in the

inhibitory e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk-induced gluplasminogen activation.
3.2. e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  on amidolytic activities of
lys-plasmin, mini-plasmin, uk and v125-uk
it was previously reported that the amidolytic activity of plasmin was inhibited by  xxxd146xxx  with a ki of
98 mm [32]. however, in the present study, no measurable e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on lys-plasmin or mini-plasmin activity against s2251 was observed when the
concentration of  xxxd146xxx  was below 50 mm (data
not shown). in contrast, the amidolytic activities of
both uk and v125-uk were competitively inhibited
by  xxxd146xxx  with a similar inhibition constant (ki ) of
10.5 þ 0.9 mm.
3.3. e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  and kringle 1^3 fragment on
plasminogen activation by uk, v125-uk,
cpb-pretreated uk and v125-uk (reaction 3)
glu-plasminogen activation by uk and by v125uk were comparable (fig. 2a,b), and the generation
of plasmin was decreased when the  xxxd146xxx  concen-

tration was below 0.5 mm. while an  xxxd146xxx  doesdependent inhibition of glu-plasminogen activation
was observed in the presence of low  xxxd146xxx  concentrations ( 6 0.15 mm), an  xxxd146xxx  dose-dependent
promotion was found at higher  xxxd146xxx  concentrations (0.5^5.0 mm), reaching a limit at an  xxxd146xxx 
concentration of 5.0 mm (fig. 2a,b).
both uk (fig. 2c) and v125-uk (data not
shown) induced lys-plasminogen activation were signi¢cantly and comparably inhibited by  xxxd146xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner.
the ¢nding that the  xxxd146xxx  e¡ect on uk and
v125-uk-induced plasminogen activation was comparable indicated that the egf and kringle domains

of uk were not involved in the e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on
reaction 3. the di¡erent inhibitory behavior of
 xxxd146xxx  on lys-, glu-, and mini-plasminogen (see below) activation suggested that more than a direct
e¡ect by  xxxd146xxx  on the active site of uk was involved.
uk-induced plasminogen activation was previously shown to be promoted by the c-terminal lysine
(lys158 ) on the a-chain of uk [33]. recently, the
uk149ÿ158 region was proposed to be an important
functional motif that could act as a ligand for the
kringles of plasminogen [34]. the role of lys158 in
the  xxxd146xxx  e¡ect was studied by cpb treatment of
uk (fig. 2d) and v125-uk (data not shown). when

bbapro 36609 1-5-02

188

z. sun et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1596 (2002) 182^192

 xxxd146xxx  concentration was below 5.0 mm, glu-plasminogen activation by cpb-pretreated uk was promoted by  xxxd146xxx  in a dose-dependant manner, and
no inhibition was found at low concentrations of
 xxxd146xxx . these results suggested that the lys158 of
uk was involved in the inhibitory e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx .
since it seems unlikely that the c-terminal lys158 on
the a-chain (of uk) could a¡ect the catalytic site of
uk, we postulate that the interaction between plasminogen and lys158 of uk, which facilitates plasminogen activation, might be blocked in the presence
of  xxxd146xxx . this inhibitory e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  was previously overlooked, probably because the uk used
[6^8,10] was puri¢ed from urine and therefore, was
missing the c-terminal lys158 [35].
based on the above results, the dose-dependent
e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on glu-plasminogen activation could
be explained. at low  xxxd146xxx  concentrations ( 6 0.15
mm), inhibition predominated, probably due to
blocking the interaction of glu-plasminogen with
the c-terminal lysine of uk. at higher  xxxd146xxx  concentrations, promotion predominated due to inducing an open conformation of glu-plasminogen.
neither  xxxd146xxx  (fig. 2e) nor cpb pretreatment of
uk (data not shown) had a signi¢cant e¡ect on
mini-plasminogen activation, indicating that the
kringle1^4 of (glu- or lys-) plasminogen was involved in the inhibitory e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on plasminogen activation by uk (reaction 3). this was further con¢rmed by the inhibition of kringle 1^3
fragment on uk-induced plasminogen activation
(fig. 2f).
in summary, these ¢ndings suggested that the interaction between (glu or lys-) plasminogen and
uk is mediated by the kringle 1^4 of plasminogen
and the c-terminal lys158 of uk, and that this interaction (which facilitated plasminogen activation)
might be blocked by low concentrations of  xxxd146xxx ,
thereby causing inhibition of reaction 3.
3.4. e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  and kringle 1^3 fragment on
pro-uk and v125-pro-uk activation by
lys-plasmin and mini-plasmin (reaction 2)
pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin was signi¢cantly inhibited by  xxxd146xxx  in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3a), whereas  xxxd146xxx  only slightly inhibited
v125-pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin (fig. 3b)

and pro-uk activation by mini-plasmin (fig. 3c).
these ¢ndings suggested that the kringle 1^4 of
lys-plasmin as well as the egf and/or kringle domain of pro-uk were involved in the inhibitory effect of  xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin
(reaction 2). a dose-dependent inhibition of kringle
1^3 fragment on pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin
was also observed (fig. 3d). by contrast, kringle 1^3
fragment had little e¡ect on plasmin activation of
v125-pro-uk (data not shown). these results suggested that the interaction between lys-plasmin
and pro-uk is mediated by the kringle 1^4 of plasmin and the n-terminal region of pro-uk, and that
this interaction (which facilitated pro-uk activation)
could be blocked by  xxxd146xxx , thereby causing inhibition of reaction 2.

mini-) activation by uk, v125-uk and

were comparable (table 1), indicating that the nterminal region of uk were not signi¢cantly involved in this reaction.
the catalytic e⁄ciencies of mini-plasminogen activation by uk, cpb-pretreated uk or v125-uk
were comparable, but were only about half as e⁄cient as that of lys-plasminogen activation (table 1).
these data were consistent with earlier ¢ndings (fig.
2), and indicated that the binding of kringle 1^4 of
plasminogen with the c-terminal lys158 of uk facilitated plasminogen activation. this was further supported by the ¢nding that lys-plasminogen and
mini-plasminogen activation by cpb-pretreated uk
were also comparable (table 1).
both the km and kcat of uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation were increased by  xxxd146xxx  in a dosedependent manner (table 2). at low  xxxd146xxx  concentrations ( 6 0.5 mm), the increase in km was predominant. when the concentration of  xxxd146xxx  was more
than 0.5 mm, the increase in kcat exceeded km , and
plasmin generation was promoted.
since the kd for the weak  xxxd146xxx  binding site of
glu-plasminogen was 5.0 mm [13], less than 1% of
the weak binding site was occupied at 0.05 mm

table 2, it was postulated that low concentrations
of  xxxd146xxx  inhibited uk activation of glu-plasminogen by occupying the high-a⁄nity lysine binding site
located in kringle 1^4 of plasminogen and preventing
plasminogen binding to the c-terminal lys158 of uk.

3.8-fold greater than that of v125-pro-uk activation
(table 3). by contrast, the catalytic e⁄ciencies of
v125-pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin and miniplasmin were comparable. these data supported previous speculation that the interaction between prouk and the kringles of plasminogen a¡ected the
binding and activation of pro-uk at the active site
of plasmin [36], and further con¢rmed that the
n-terminal region of pro-uk and kringle 1^4 of
plasmin were both required to facilitate pro-uk activation.
in the presence of  xxxd146xxx , the km increased in a
dose-dependent manner and the catalytic e⁄ciency
(kcat /km ) of pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin was
reduced. by contrast,  xxxd146xxx  only had slight inhibition of v125-pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin (table 4), which was consistent with previous ¢nding
that the n-terminal region of pro-uk was involved
in the inhibitory e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk activation.
since pro-uk activation by lys-plasmin was signi¢cantly inhibited when the  xxxd146xxx  concentration
was only 0.05 mm (fig. 3 and table 4), far less
than the kd for the weak  xxxd146xxx  binding site of
lys-plasmin [14], we postulated that this inhibition
was related to  xxxd146xxx  occupying the high-a⁄nity lysine binding site located in kringle 1^4 of plasmin,
which prevented the binding interaction between
plasmin and the n-terminal region of pro-uk.
the di¡erent e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  on plasmin generation induced by ala158 -pro-uk, pro-uk and v125pro-uk could be explained by the in£uence of
 xxxd146xxx  on reactions 1^3. for ala158 -pro-uk activation of glu-plasminogen, only reaction 1 was involved, since ala158 -pro-uk cannot be activated by

plasmin.  xxxd146xxx  promoted reaction 1 by inducing an
open conformation of glu-plasminogen.
for pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation
in the presence of low concentrations of  xxxd146xxx 
( 6 0.5 mm), reaction 1 was slightly promoted by
 xxxd146xxx , while reactions 2 and 3 were signi¢cantly
inhibited, and net plasmin generation was decreased.
at higher  xxxd146xxx  concentrations (0.5^5.0 mm), reaction 3 became promoted by  xxxd146xxx  in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a decline in overall inhibition.
for v125-pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation at low concentrations of  xxxd146xxx  ( 6 0.5
mm), both reactions 2 and 3 were inhibited, which
accounted for a net decrease of plasmin generation.
at higher concentrations of  xxxd146xxx  (1.0^5.0 mm),
the promoting e¡ect of  xxxd146xxx  on reaction 3 overcame its weak inhibitory e¡ect on reaction 2 (fig. 3
and table 4), and overall plasminogen activation was
enhanced.
our results di¡ered from those in a previous report
[20] in which 2.0 mm  xxxd146xxx  was found to promote
pro-uk-induced glu-plasminogen activation in the
presence of cl3 . the reason for this di¡erence is

unknown. within a wide range of concentrations of
pro-uk (0.1^10 nm) and glu-plasminogen (0.2^8.0
wm) tested, we found a similar inhibitory e¡ect of
 xxxd146xxx  on pro-uk-induced plasminogen activation.
in conclusion,  xxxd146xxx  is an inhibitor of pro-ukinduced plasminogen activation. this e¡ect was due
to its inhibition of two reactions, uk activation of
plasminogen and plasmin activation of pro-uk.
analysis of the e¡ects of  xxxd146xxx  showed that the
binding of kringle 1^4 of plasmin to the n-terminal
region of pro-uk promoted pro-uk activation, and
that the binding of kringle 1^4 of plasminogen to the
c-terminal lys158 of uk promoted plasminogen activation. these interactions were interrupted by
 xxxd146xxx , accounting for its inhibitory e¡ect.
