androgen receptors are present in numerous tissues throughout the female body,
and knowledge of the specific actions of androgens at different sites is increasing, along
with the understanding of their contribution to various pathophysiological states. this
article reviews the physiology of androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) and
immediate androgen precursors (dehydroepiandrosterone [dhea], dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [ xxxg2231xxx ], and androstenedione), with specific reference to the androgen
receptor, production and metabolism of c-19 steroids, circulating androgen concentrations, and androgen actions. in addition, the evidence for physiological modulation of
androgens including circadian variation, cyclical variation, age, and natural menopause is
reviewed.

ndrogens in women have multiple physiological roles, which currently are incompletely defined.
androgen receptors have been reported to be located
in diverse anatomical sites, underpinning their roles in
human physiology in multiple systems. knowledge of
androgen physiology in women in general lags behind
that in men; however, important features common to
both sexes include the roles of androgens in growth,
reproduction, and development.
androgens measured in routine clinical management of women include testosterone, androstenedione,
and the so-called pre-androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( xxxg2231xxx ). the latter is the sulfated form of
dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), a precursor compound for androgen production. of importance also is
sex hormone–binding globulin (shbg), which binds
with high affinity to total testosterone, and thus
affects the amount of free testosterone in the peripheral
circulation.1

 xxxg183xxx 
the  xxxg183xxx  is nuclear based, and is encoded
by a gene on the long arm of the x chromosome.2 the
receptor binds only testosterone and dihydrotestosterone3; the effects of testosterone are mediated by intracellular conversion to the more potent dihydrotestosterone via 5a-reductase. androgen receptors are present
in a wide variety of tissues, including skeletal muscle,4
skin,5 gastrointestinal tract,6 heart,7 brain,8 bone,9 adipose tissue,10 genitourinary tract,11 placenta,12 and even
lacrimal glands,13 although it is unclear whether androgens have specific actions at all of these sites.

c-19 steroids
c-19 steroids include dhea, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone, and are formed via
cytochrome p450 and 3b/17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase–based enzymatic conversions originating from
current perspectives on the use of androgens in women; guest

cholesterol (fig. 1). testosterone and dihydrotestosterone act directly with the  xxxg183xxx , whereas
androstenedione, the major c-19 steroid, does not.
likewise, dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  are in general considered to be biologically inert steroids, are collectively
known as pre-androgens, and act as precursors for
testosterone production via androstenedione.
testosterone circulates tightly bound to shbg
and less tightly to albumin (66% and 33%, respectively,
in the nonpregnant state).1 free testosterone is therefore
limited to comprise only 1 to 2% of circulating testosterone.1

androgen production
estimated actual daily production rates of androgens and
pre-androgens in reproductive-age women are 3.5 to
20 mg of  xxxg2231xxx , 8 mg of dhea, 3 to 6 mg of
androstenedione, 100 to 300 mg of testosterone, and 4.3
to 12.5 mg of dihydrotestosterone.14,15

sites of androgen production
reproductive-age women

the bulk of androgen production in women arises from
the adrenal cortices and ovarian thecal cells/stroma.
acth regulates adrenal production of androgen pre-

cursors, whereas  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  (lh) regulates
ovarian androgen production. precursors dhea and
androstenedione are produced by the ovaries and adrenal
cortices, the latter of which produces the majority of
dhea (80%) and its sulfate,  xxxg2231xxx  (> 90%).16
direct ovarian secretion is thought to account for one
third of testosterone production, whereas the remainder
is accounted for by conversion of androstenedione in
peripheral or extragonadal sites, including adipose tissue
and skin.17 there is much debate about the direct
adrenal production of testosterone, with some studies
reporting either very little testosterone production by the
adrenals18 or none.19 dihydrotestosterone is produced
mainly by target tissues.
postmenopausal women

much debate exists about the ovarian production of
androgens after menopause, with some authors claiming
that there is negligible ovarian production of androgens
in postmenopausal women, and others claiming that the
postmenopausal ovary continues to produce androgens.
current thinking is such that the origin of most androgens in postmenopausal women is the adrenal cortex,
whereas testosterone is believed to originate primarily
from the ovaries.20,21
ovarian secretion of testosterone and androstenedione, but negligible secretion of dhea,  xxxg2231xxx ,
or dihydrotestosterone, has been reported.22,23 in terms

androgen physiology/davison, bell

androgen metabolism
androstenedione is converted to testosterone, via 17bsteroid dehydrogenase type iii, or to estrone, via the
aromatase cytochrome p450 enzyme, a product of the
 xxxg574xxx  gene. peripheral aromatization of androstenedione to estrone increases with age and weight.26 likewise, testosterone is ultimately irreversibly converted to
dihydrotestosterone via 5a-reductase or to estradiol
by aromatase. dihydrotestosterone is metabolized to
17-ketosteroids and other products ultimately excreted
in urine.

androgen concentrations
in terms of concentration, the pre-androgens dhea
and  xxxg2231xxx  circulate at concentrations approximately
a thousand-fold greater than that of androstenedione
(measured in micromoles per liter and nanomoles per
liter, respectively), which in turn circulates at about 10
times the concentration of total testosterone (measured
in nanomoles per liter). free testosterone is estimated
to comprise only 1 to 2% of levels of total testosterone
(measured in picomoles per liter).1 considerable differences also exist with regard to affinity of binding to

shbg and potency of androgens, such that the
strength of binding of testosterone to shbg and its
relative potency are greater when compared with androstenedione,  xxxg2231xxx , and dhea, despite the
marked differences in circulating concentrations in
women.1
normal female ranges for the androgens and
pre-androgens vary considerably according to individual assays/assay technique. the largest study of physiologically normal women to date has described 10th to
90th percentile ranges of 0.5 to 10.8 mmol/l for
 xxxg2231xxx , 1.3 to 13.7 nmol/liter for androstenedione,
0.3 to 2.5 nmol/l for total testosterone, and 3.4 to
38.6 pmol/l for calculated free testosterone (using the
sodergard equation).25

androgen actions
androgens have direct effects and also act as precursor
hormones for ovarian and extragonadal estrogen synthesis. testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are active
at nuclear androgen receptors around the body, binding
to receptors and in turn activating androgen target genes.
dihydrotestosterone is the more potent of the two
steroids with regard to androgenic effects on target
tissues such as skin and hair follicles.
androgen action appears to be dependent on both
the concentration of androgen receptors in target tissues
and on the presence and activity of 5-areductase/
aromatase enzymes, which convert testosterone to the
potent dihydrotestosterone or inactive androstenedione/
estradiol respectively.
testosterone has been identified in the female
brain, with highest concentrations in the hypothalamus,
preoptic area, and substantia nigra.27 some aspects of
cognitive function, including visuospatial ability, have
been reported to improve in studies of androgen administration to female-to-male transsexuals.28
androgens also have important roles in bone
mineralization, and appear to have both direct effects
and effects via aromatization to estrogen. lower androgen concentrations have been associated with bone loss
in pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women,29 and levels
of  xxxg2231xxx  have been correlated positively with bone
mineral density in postmenopausal women.30

physiological modulators of
androgens
circadian variation
in premenopausal women, the majority of studies
suggest the presence of a diurnal variation in levels of
dhea,  xxxg2231xxx , androstenedione, and dihydrotestosterone, with morning peak levels of all steroids
measured.29–36 the evidence for a diurnal variation in

of contribution, others have concluded that the postmenopausal ovary contributes approximately 50% to
plasma testosterone levels and 30% to androstenedione
levels, and that the adrenal glands were the predominant
contributor to dhea levels.20
in recent times, the postmenopausal ovary has not
been viewed as a major androgen-producing gland, and
that in the absence of adrenal steroids, postmenopausal
women have negligible concentrations of circulating
androgens.24 more recently, however, others have reported significantly lower levels of free and total testosterone in bilaterally oophorectomized postmenopausal
women versus normal controls.25
in summary, there are some inconsistencies with
regard to the findings of studies examining the sites of
androgen production in women. consistent findings
among studies include the adrenal cortical production
of dhea, the majority of  xxxg2231xxx , and androstenedione. the direct secretion of testosterone from the
adrenal glands is controversial.
in premenopausal women, the primary androgen
secreted by the ovary is androstenedione, whereas limited amounts of  xxxg2231xxx , if any, are produced by the
ovaries. ovarian production of testosterone is under lh
control and varies throughout the menstrual cycle. half
of circulating testosterone is believed to arise from the
ovaries, with the majority of the other half arising from
conversion of androstenedione. the production of androgens by the postmenopausal ovary is currently under
debate.

testosterone levels in premenopausal women is conflicting, with approximately half of the studies in this area
suggesting a morning peak in total testosterone levels,32,34,37 and others describing a morning trough level31
or no difference in levels across the day.36,38–40 for free
testosterone, one study reported a morning peak level37
and one suggested no change throughout the day.38 this
disparity between the presence of a circadian variation
for testosterone versus the other sex steroids may reflect
the lack of precision in assays for total and free testosterone at female levels, rather than reflect a true description of physiology.41
very few studies have examined the presence of a
circadian variation in androgen levels in postmenopausal women; one study reported morning peak levels
in total testosterone, dhea, androstenedione, and
dihydrotestosterone,20 whereas another study reported
no change in total testosterone levels throughout the
day.42

cyclical variation
the majority of studies have described a midcycle
increase in total testosterone levels occurring alongside
the lh peak16,43–51; one study also reported a nadir in
levels in the early follicular phase.48 others suggest no
change in levels throughout the menstrual cycle.39,40,52–54
two studies have reported a midcycle increase in levels of
free testosterone.48,49 as may be the case with circadian
variation of androgen levels, these findings may reflect
insensitivity of assays for total testosterone rather than
represent actual physiology.
several studies support the presence of a
cyclical variation in androstenedione (a midcycle
increase),16,43,44,46,47 but not for dhea,16,46,55
 xxxg2231xxx ,16,45,52 or dihydrotestosterone.44

effects of age
studies of changes of androgen levels with age in adult
females lack general consistency in their findings, are
heterogeneous in nature by design and by exclusion
criteria, and frequently are limited to the reproductive
or postreproductive state. in addition, many studies are
limited by the assays used for measurement of androgen
levels, especially in the case of total testosterone, for
which issues of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and
precision arise. several studies also report total or free
testosterone levels without concurrent reporting of
shbg levels.
to address these problems, a recent study has
measured levels of total testosterone, shbg, calculated
free testosterone, androstenedione, and  xxxg2231xxx  in a
reference group of 595 women age 18 to 75 years who
were free of factors known to modulate androgen levels,
and using a sensitive and validated assay for measurement of total testosterone.25,41 all sex steroids in this
study were found to decrease significantly with age
(fig. 2), with the steepest decline evident in the age
group 18 to 34 years. modeling of the data suggested a
nadir in levels occurring from early in the seventh decade
to late in the eight decade, with a slight increase in levels
thereafter. the physiological basis of this consistent
decrease in androgen levels from the early reproductive
years is unclear.

effects of menopause
the independent effects of menopause on androgens are
difficult to disentangle from those of age,25 and several
studies have reported lower levels of androgens in postversus premenopausal women, without controlling
for age. the majority of studies that have controlled
for age have found no change in levels of testosterone,

androstenedione, dhea, or  xxxg2231xxx  directly attributable to menopause.25,56–60
conclusions
our knowledge of androgen physiology and the contribution of androgens to pathophysiological states in
women is increasing. androgen receptors are distributed
throughout the body, and the actions of androgens at
these sites currently are incompletely understood. levels
of androgens decrease from the early reproductive years,
and the physiological basis for this is unclear. menopause appears to have no independent effect on androgen
levels, unlike the steep decrease in estradiol seen at this
time. the circadian and cyclical variation in androgen
levels needs to be taken into account in measurement of
androgen levels in adult females.
