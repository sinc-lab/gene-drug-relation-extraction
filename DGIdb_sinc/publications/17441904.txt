hantavirus-induced diseases such as hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome are a global health concern.
hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by
sin nombre virus lacks specific therapy and its
high mortality makes sin nombre virus a potential
bioweapon agent. sin nombre virus entry into susceptible cells requires expression of avb3 integrin.
we recently reported the sequence of a cyclic
nonapeptide that inhibited sin nombre virus entry
into vero e6 cells at a level comparable to reopro,
a fab fragment of the anti-b3 antibody  xxxd53xxx .
here, we refine the parental peptide, cyclo[cpfvktqlc], using alanine scanning and amino
acid deletions, by optimizing for viral inhibition.
the ic50 of the resulting peptide, cyclo-[cpfvc],
was 267 lm compared with 263 lm for the parental
peptide. the solution structure of cyclo-[cpfvc]
was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing the phe
ring in an extended conformation stacked against
the pro ring and containing a b-turn encompassing
val-4 through cys-1. as an initial step in identifying interactions between cyclo-[cpfvc] and its
target cellular receptor, the refined peptide structure was docked into the reopro binding site of
integrin b3. this structure will provide the basis
for designing more potent peptidomimetic therapeutics to prevent sin nombre virus entry and
treat hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

according to the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, there are four viral families recognized as category a priority
pathogens due to their ability to cause viral hemorrhagic fever: arenaviruses (machupo virus, lassa fever), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses,
rift valley fever virus), flaviviruses (dengue virus) and filoviruses
(ebola and marburg viruses). in addition, to being a global health
concern, these viruses are considered to be bioweapon threat
agents because of their high lethality, aerosol transmission and lack
of specific treatment. sin nombre virus (snv), a hantavirus from
the family bunyaviridae, is a causative agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (hcps), another rare but high-mortality syndrome with no specific treatment. the potential for release of snv
or other hantaviruses as bioweapons demands development of compounds for prophylaxis or therapeutic intervention.
snv and other pathogenic hantaviruses in the family bunyaviridae
are carried by wild rodents of the family muridae. hantaviruses are
enveloped spherical particles with a helical nucleocapsid and a genome consisting of three negative-sense rna segments. the hantavirus rna segments are designated l [large; 6500 nucleotides (nt)],
m (middle; 3600–3700 nt) and s (small; 1700–2100 nt) and encode,
respectively, an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), a glycoprotein precursor (gpc) that is processed into g1 and g2 transmembrane glycoproteins, and a nucleocapsid protein (n). it is probable
that hantavirus entry into human endothelial cells is mediated by
interaction of g1/g2 glycoproteins with the integrin avb3 expressed
on the host cell surface (1,2).
entry of pathogenic hantaviruses such as snv into human cells can
be prevented by neutralizing antibodies directed against the virus or
against the integrin receptor avb3. however, even humanized mab
may have significant side effects in patients compared with peptide
administration (3,4). we recently reported specific cyclo-nonapeptides, identified by use of a combinatorial peptide phage display library, which bind avb3 and inhibit snv entry into avb3-expressing
cells (5). we selected one of the most potent of these peptides,
cyclo-[cpfvktqlc], which is cyclized through a cys1–cys9 disulphide bond, for further refinement and analysis. a combination of
alanine scaning and residue deletions were used to identify the
putative active residues. the three-dimensional structure of the
resulting peptide, cyclo-[cpfvc], cyclized through a cys1–cys5 disulphide bond, was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr) spectroscopy. this structure was subsequently used for docking studies with the crystal structure of human avb3 [pdb id 1u8c
(6)]. the structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] is an ideal target for use as a

nmr structure of a novel anti-hantavirus peptide

pharmacophore to search for highly potent peptidomimetic molecules to combat hcps and viral hemorrhagic fever caused by pathogenic hantaviruses.

materials and methods
reagents and monoclonal antibodies
cysteine-constrained peptides were synthesized by biopeptide (san
diego, ca, usa) and solubilized at a concentration of 10 mm in
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 5%  xxxd1896xxx ,
ph 7.4. peptide stocks were stored at )80c until use. reopro, a
fab fragment of the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody
 xxxd53xxx , was purchased from eli lilly and company (indianapolis, in,
usa), and suspended in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m sodium
chloride, and 0.001% polysorbate 80, ph 7.2. vero e6 cells (atcc
crl 1586) were purchased from the american type culture collection (manassas, va, usa) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg) was purchased from
boehringer mannheim (indianapolis, in, usa).

focus reduction test
twenty-four hours prior to beginning the assay, duplicate wells of
105 vero e6 cells/well were plated onto lab-tek 16-well chamber
slides (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa, usa) using minimal essential medium (mem) (gibco, grand island, ny, usa) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (fbs), and incubated at 37c. the confluent cells
were washed once with pbs and serially diluted synthetic peptide
or reopro was added in a volume of 50 ll directly to the cells
and incubated at 37c in mem with 2.5% fbs for 1 h. we then
added 50 ll of snv strain sn77734 (7) (500–1000 focus-forming
units/ml) in mem-2.5% fbs and incubated the cells for 1 h at
37c in a biosafety level 3 facility, centers for disease control
registration number c20041018-0267. the virus was removed by
aspiration. the cells were washed twice with pbs, and the media
replaced with mem-2.5% fbs. after 24–36 h, the cells were fixed
in 300 ll/well ice-cold methanol/acetone (50:50) and the slide was
maintained at 4c until staining. cells were washed twice with
pbs before staining, and then overlaid with 100 ll of a 1:10 000
dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-snv recombinant n antibody (8) in
pbs. after 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37c, we added 50 ll
of 1:500 fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit igg in pbs then washed the
cells three times in pbs. for counterstaining we used 200 ll of
1:105 evans blue (wt/vol) for 3–5 min, and then rinsed with water.
after mounting, foci were counted by fluorescent microscopic
examination. to determine the number of snv foci added to each
well, we used control wells that lacked any inhibitor. after normalization for reopro activity, the percent inhibition was calculated as
the number of infected cells compared with the untreated controls.
the relative activity of each peptide was determined to be the
(percent inhibition of the mutant peptide)/(percent inhibition of the
parental peptide).

nmr data acquisition and processing
the cyclo-[cpfvc] peptide was dissolved at a concentration of
10 mm in pbs, ph 7.4 in h2o to which 10% d2o was added to

provide a lock nucleus. chemical shifts are reported with respect to
internal 1 mm dss [sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propane-d6-sulfonic
acid; isotec, miamisburg, oh, usa]. nmr spectra were acquired on
a bruker avance 500 mhz instrument (billerica, ma, usa) using
watergate water suppression with a 2.5 mm probe equipped with
3-axis gradients. data acquisition was performed at 295.0 k and
the temperature was monitored and controlled to within €0.1 k
with a bruker bvt3000 temperature controller operating a liquid
nitrogen reservoir. residue assignments were derived from total
correlated spectroscopy (tocsy), nuclear overhauser enhancement
spectroscopy (noesy), and rotational nuclear overhauser effect
spectroscopy (roesy) data sets. spectra were fourier-transformed
with polynomial solvent elimination in both dimensions with the aid
of nmrpipe software (9) and felix (accelrys, inc., san diego, ca,
usa). interproton distances were measured from a set of roesy time
courses measured with mixing times ranging from 50 to 300 ms.

nmr spectral analysis and restraint generation
the utilization of roesy data for restraint generation was performed essentially as previously published (10). the mixing-time
dependences of the nuclear overhauser effects (noes) were determined from quadratic polynomial fits to noe peak volumes. interproton distances were generated by comparing the volumes of
cross-peaks from the b to the b¢ protons in phenylalanine (r ¼
1.74 ) to cross-peaks of unknown distance using the isolated spinpair approximation (11). coupling constants (3jhn-h) were measured
in high digital resolution (0.1 hz) 1d-nmr experiments.

molecular modeling
distance geometry (dg) calculations were performed as previously
described (10) using insight ii (accelrys) on a 400 mhz silicon
graphics octane2 workstation. the inputs for the calculation were
(i) the molecular structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] minimized to a convergence of 10)7 using the conjugate gradient method and (ii) the
noe-derived distance restraints. optimization of the structures was
carried out with a short (10 ps) simulated annealing (sa) protocol
using the consistent valence force field (cvff) forcefield and a
dielectric constant of 80. this process was repeated to generate
100 structures for further analysis.

cpfvc:itb3 docking
integrin b3 protein coordinates were obtained from the published
structure [pdb 1u8c (6)]. sybyl software (tripos inc., st louis, mo,
usa) was used to prepare both receptor protein and peptide for
docking. non-polar hydrogen atoms were removed and charges
were merged into the bonded carbon atoms. heteroatoms were
removed from the receptor protein and partial charges were
assigned based on the kollman united atom charge set. cyclo[cpfvc] peptide partial charges were based on the gasteiger-huckel
method provided in sybyl. electrostatic and potential grids were
centered on the reopro:b3 binding site (residues 129, c177–184) as
previously identified (12) and were set to encompass a volume of
8.9 lm3. all free torsions were removed and docking was carried
out using autodock 3.0 software (13) (http://autodock.scripps.edu/)
with a population size of 50, 5.0 · 105 energy evaluations, and 200

6.5 and using eight 300 mhz processors.

results
characterization of inhibitory peptides
our previous report (5) described repeated selection of phage from
a cyclic nonapeptide phage display library (new england biolabs,
cambridge, ma, usa) to enrich for phage binding to avb3 integrin.
based on a group of phage identified as the most potent inhibitors
of snv entry into vero e6 cells in a focus reduction assay, we synthesized and screened four cyclic peptides, (cyclo-[cpfvktqlc],
cyclo-[clhkpwsrc], cyclo-[crsltdnqc] and cyclo-[cpghihrtc]), for
their abilities to inhibit snv entry in vitro (5). the most potent of
these synthesized peptides, cyclo-[cpfvktqlc], was selected for further investigation.

figure 1: focus reduction assay demonstrating inhibitory activities against snv of peptides with amino acid deletions based on
cyclo-[cpfvktqlc]. peptide sequences were tested for their ability
to block snv entry into vero e6 cells. each peptide (2 mm) was
pre-incubated with virus (2000 pfu) for 1 h prior to adding to cells.
reopro was used as blocking control at 80 lg/ml. two types of
buffer controls are shown: media is cell culture media only, and
buffer is pbs used for peptide suspension (n ¼ 4–8).

we produced alanine-substituted derivatives of cyclo-[cpfvktqlc]
to determine the amino acid residues that are critical for inhibitory
activity. an alanine was substituted at each position in the peptide
and each peptide examined in parallel for inhibition of snv entry
into vero e6 cells. based on the percent inhibition, the relative
activity of each peptide was calculated (table 1). we found that
substitution of the position 2 proline led to the greatest loss in
inhibition, with a relative activity of 0.26. alanine substitution at
position 4 had the least impact on relative activity at 0.97, while
the remaining residues, phe-3, lys-5, thr-6, gln-7 and leu-8,
showed an intermediate impact, with relative activities ranging from
0.42 to 0.82. based on the change in inhibitory activity when
replaced by alanine, residue 2 (proline) was considered to be critical to the inhibitory activity of cyclo-[cpfvktqlc]. the contribution
of pro-2 to inhibition is possibly due to direct binding interactions
with b3 or to secondary effects on the structure of the cyclic peptide
which increase its stability in a conformation favorable for binding or
increases the resistance of the peptide to proteolytic degradation.

four c-terminal deletion mutants of the cyclo-peptide were synthesized (cpfvc, cpfvkc, cpfvktc, and cpfvktqc) and tested for
inhibitory activity compared with the parental nonapeptide and cafvktqlc (figure 1). sequential deletion of thr-6, gln-7 and leu-8
resulted in significant loss of inhibition, with relative activities ranging from 0.05 to 0.5. notably, however, the smallest cyclo-peptide
identified, cyclo-[cpfvc], maintained inhibitory capability (relative
activity of 0.85) when compared with the parental peptide. this
minimized peptide sequence was selected for further comparison
against the parental peptide cyclo-[cpfvktqlc].

with the long-term goal in mind of producing a non-peptide
mimetic, we opted to define the minimal peptide length required
for activity. as reported above, alanine-substitution derivatives indicated that residue 2 of cyclo-[cpfvktqlc] was crucial for inhibition
of snv entry in vitro (cafvktqlc in table 1). based on that result,

we next determined whether the parental peptide, cyclo[cpfvktqlc], or cyclo-[cpfvc] inhibited snv entry in vero e6 cells
in a dose-dependent manner and the concentration of half-maximal
inhibition (ic50). the ic50s were similar for the two peptides and

nmr assignments
the assignments for the peptide protons are reported in table 2.
most of the assignments were accomplished based on a comparison
of the chemical shifts of the residues with those from random coil
spectra (14). we could not complete the assignments in this manner
because of unique features of the pentapeptide. cys-1 and pro-2
have no amide protons, so the fingerprint region of the tocsy spectrum contained only three amide correlations from the amide protons
of phe-3, val-4, and cys-5. the b protons of both the phe-3 and
cys-5 residues resonated at essentially the same frequency, so that
unambiguous assignments of their amide resonances could not be
accomplished based on spin couplings appearing in the tocsy spectrum alone. furthermore, the presence of a phe residue suggested
that ring current shifts would be observed for one or more neighboring residues. these ring currents primarily influenced the protons on
pro-2, so we will discuss the assignments for this residue first.

examination of the toscy spectrum of cpfvc (figure 3a) showed
the typical coupling pattern for the a)b)c)d protons in pro-2, and
indicated that the resonance at 1.72 p.p.m. arose from pro-2. we
assigned the pro b1 proton to the resonance at 1.72 p.p.m. on the
basis of three factors: first, it was the closest proton to the phe
ring and experienced the largest ring current shift. the reverse
assignment, that of  xxxg2028xxx  to this shift, would have resulted in a ring
current shift of almost zero, while the shift for  xxxg2028xxx  would then
have exceeded 0.5 p.p.m. second, both of these protons are close
enough to the phe ring (0.4 nm) so that they should both show
shifts of 0.2–0.3 p.p.m. finally, we used the chemical shift prediction software of case (http://www.scripps.edu/mb/case/qshifts/
qshifts.htm) and williamson (15) and both programs predicted that

have found that pro ha resonates at 4.3 p.p.m. in the trans conformation, while it is found at 3.2 p.p.m. in the cis conformation.

nmr structure of a novel anti-hantavirus peptide

to the assignments for these amino acids utilized the throughspace interactions found in the roesy spectrum. in addition to
phe-3-induced ring current shifts of the proline b proton resonances, one should observe relatively strong noes between these two
residues. cys-5 was too far away from the phe ring to experience
any ring current shifts. therefore, examination of the roesy spectrum of the peptide (figure 3b) revealed the correct assignments
for the cys-5 and phe-3 amides as follows: we observed noes
between the phe amide proton (d ¼ 7.65 p.p.m.) and the phe b¢
proton (d ¼ 3.29 p.p.m.), the phe 4 and 3,5 ring protons, as well
as to the a,b, and d protons of pro-2. we therefore assigned the
phe amide proton to the signal  xxxd2274xxx .65 p.p.m. further support for
this assignment came from the observation of sequential amide
noes from cys-5 to val-4 to phe-3 to the phe ring protons,
respectively, in that order. these assignments also allowed us to
differentiate the phe ha at 4.71 p.p.m., from the cys-5 ha at
4.66 p.p.m. finally, the lack of an amide proton resonance from
cys-1 allowed us to differentiate the nmr signals of cys-1 from
those of cys-5.

noe build-up and distance restraint calculation
the noes in the rotating frame were measured at 295 k for four
roesy mixing times from 50 to 300 ms, and for six noesy mixing times from 50 to 400 ms. both the noesy and the roesy
experiments displayed strongly negative solution noes (data not

shown). the signal-to-noise ratio for the roesy data sets was
superior to that of the noesy data sets, so we used the roesy
data alone to derive a total of 67 pairs of noes, measured from
both sides of the diagonal, giving 13 noes per residue. the
ratio of the distances derived from the paired noes across the
diagonal was 1.02 € 0.14, where most of the error was contributed by distances greater than 2.1 . the noe-derived distances
were used as restraints in sa by assigning the lower distance
bound to the noe-derived distance, and an upper bound of
0.5 nm.

backbone 3jhn)ha analysis
the folding of the cpfvc peptide into its secondary structure
involved rotations around the backbone bonds to accommodate the
constraints imposed by cyclization through the disulfide link of the
terminal cysteines. the 3jnh)ah coupling constants for the phe-3,
val-4, and cys-5 residues (table 2) were interpreted within the
framework of the karplus relationship (19) and were all consistent
with backbone dihedral angles, u, of )120. for val-4, we found
that )158 < u < )82, for phe-3, )140 < u < )100, and for cys5 )155 < u < )85. as shown by the ramchandran plots (figure 4a)
for the cluster of 11 lowest energy structures, the backbone angles
for all residues fell into allowed regions, and the dihedral angles in
the structures agreed with those found from the above coupling constant analysis.

structural modeling and features
restrained sa produced 100 structures consistent with the noederived distance restraints. the 11 lowest energy structures were
very similar in energy, with a coefficient of variation of only 2.8%.
the average rmsd resulting from the superposition of these 11
low-energy structures was 1.07 . the lowest energy model of the
nmr-derived solution structure of the peptide is shown in figure 4c.
we found that the 11 best nmr structures were all characterized
by the phe ring in an extended conformation stacked against the
pro ring (figure 4b). the presence of pro in the cyclic structure led
to the expectation that the cyclic peptide would contain a b-turn
encompassing val-4 through cys-1. this was confirmed in the solution nmr structure which revealed that the val-4 a–carbon was
7  from the cys-1 a-carbon. one additional feature of our model
is that all of the backbone carbonyl oxygens are aligned on the
face of the peptide opposite to the face encompassing the phe ring
and disulfide bond (figure 4c).

docking of cyclo-[cpfvc]
even cyclized peptides can demonstrate flexibility in solution and
have the potential for flexibility in binding protein receptors. in
order to ascertain whether the nmr determined solution conformation of cyclo-[cpfvc] presented here reflects a conformation that
can be bound by the integrin b3, docking studies were performed
against the structure of b3 determined by x-ray crystallography
[1u8c.pdb (6)]. we utilized autodock 3.0 software (13) to perform
rigid docking in a molecular mechanics forcefield using a genetic
algorithm. as reopro, a derivative of the murine mab  xxxd53xxx , was
used to selectively elute the phage-bearing peptide library from
avb3, and it was these phage from which cyclo-[cpfvc] evolved,
the docking grid was centered on the binding site of mab  xxxd53xxx  as
identified by artoni et al. (12). this binding site included b3 residues w129 and c177-c184, which are positioned on the surface of
b3 in a niche approximately 15  wide. we were able to dock the
solution structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] onto this region of b3 without
distortion to the peptide backbone or changes to the orientations of
the amino acid side chains. as shown in table 3 and figure 5a, the
lowest energy complex was positioned directly within the reopro
binding site and exhibited interactions with a number of b3 residues. hydrogen bonding interactions were observed between the
cyclo-[cpfvc] backbone nitrogen of cys-1 and the mainchain carbonyl of both k125 and l128 from b3. cys-1, which also showed
extensive van der waals interactions with b3 k125, l128 and

overall binding energy of the complex. the second largest contributor to the overall binding energy was val-4 (20.6%), which also displayed van der waals interactions with b3 k125, along with t183,
c184, and val212. thus, the overall favorable binding energy of the
b3:cyclo-[cpfvc] complex results from a combination of hydrogen
bonding and hydrophobic interactions within the niche created by
b3 residues w129 and c177-c184.

discussion
to our knowledge, small molecule therapeutic interventions for preventing hantavirus cellular entry via integrin avb3 are currently nonexistent. in this present study, we present the optimization and
nmr solution structure of a cyclic peptide selected for its ability to
inhibit snv entry in vitro through blocking of avb3. this optimized
inhibitory peptide, cyclo-[cpfvc], was developed by alanine-substitution and deletion scanning of our parental peptide, cyclo[cpfvktqlc], originally identified through sequential rounds of panning a nonapeptide-bearing combinatorial phage-display library
against the avb3 integrin and eluting with the fab fragment of
 xxxd53xxx  mab (reopro) (5). both the optimized and parental peptides
have the ability to inhibit snv cellular entry in vitro at micromolar
concentrations, and the docked structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] fits neatly,
without alteration, onto the region of b3 previously identified to be
the binding surface for  xxxd53xxx  (12). this cyclic peptide provides direction for future development of even more potent and specific peptides or small molecule peptidomimetics.
inhibition of protein–protein interactions requires that the inhibitory
molecule bind the protein interaction surface of one protein partner
and prevent access by the other partner. because protein–protein
interaction sites are typically located on the surface of most globular proteins, inhibition requires the ability to interact with the solvent exposed residues at these surfaces. despite their location on
the protein surface, which might suggest the presence of predominantly polar or hydrogen-bond capable residues, protein–protein
interfaces are known to be largely hydrophobic, with electrostatic
residues and hydrogen-bonding groups uniformly distributed across
the binding interfaces (20–22). although the primary structure of
cyclo-[cpfvc] is suggestive of a predominantly hydrophobic molecule, the tertiary structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] reveals that the peptide
has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics. as previously
mentioned, all of the backbone carbonyl oxygens are aligned on the
face of the peptide opposite to the face encompassing the stacked
phe and pro rings and disulfide bond. this division of hydrophobicity
is likely a link to the peptide's specificity, because in the docked
model each of the peptide residues makes some hydrophobic contact with the binding surface of b3, while simultaneously allowing
for hydrogen bonding contributions from cys-1, pro-2, and cys-5.
the partial hydrophilic nature revealed by the nmr solution structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] also provides an explanation for the high
degree of solubility (>150 mm) of what at first approximation would
seem to be a largely hydrophobic molecule. thus, the amphipathic
nature of the cyclic peptide reported here fills a niche in the realm
of protein–protein interaction inhibition and is consistent with characteristics previously identified for protein–protein interfaces.

knowledge of the structure of an inhibitor bound to its receptor is
a necessary step in the drug design process in order to identify
residues directly involved in binding, and to assess whether the
conformation of the bound ligand differs from that of the inhibitor
in solution. as an initial step toward this goal, we docked the
solution structure of cyclo-[cpfvc] onto the mab  xxxd53xxx  binding site
of integrin b3. in solution, interactions between pro-2 and phe-3
chem biol drug des 2007; 69: 180–190

appear to play a stabilizing role for the peptide (figure 4c), and
in the docked model the orientation of these residues can be
maintained. as shown in figure 5a, cys-1, val-4, and cys-5 are
tucked between residues c177-c184 of the specificity determining
loop and w129 of b3 and form the anchor for peptide binding.
two of these peptide residues are part of a conserved b-turn
identified in the peptide solution structure, which includes residues
187

hall et al.

cys-1 to val-4. b-turns have repeatedly been shown to occur in
the binding components of numerous peptides (23–28), and aromatic stacking between phe-pro have the potential to further stabilize
b-turns (17). therefore, docking of the peptide structure of cyclo[cpfvc] onto integrin b3 highlights residues potentially critical to
both peptide stability and inhibitory activity. although binding studies and mutational analysis of cyclo-[cpfvc] and integrin b3,
together with determination of the x-ray crystal structure of the
peptide:receptor complex, are needed to definitively establish the
interactions in question, the structural information provided by our
docking studies will be used in pharmacophore programs to screen
large databases for structurally related organic compounds of
potentially higher potency.
the importance of hydrophobic residues in protein–protein recognition sites has been repeatedly demonstrated (29–31). in the case
of our parental peptide, cyclo-[cpfvktqlc], alanine scanning identified pro-2 as one of the main contributors to inhibitory activity.
this contribution is not surprising as proline is often present at
hot spots of protein–protein interaction sites (area at the interface
that contributes the most to the dg of binding) (32–34), and
because of the expected rigidity forced upon the peptide due to
the presence of proline. also not surprisingly, alanine substitution
of phe-3 resulted in a 29% loss of inhibition. both cys and phe
have been shown to be enriched at protein–protein interaction
sites (34), and aromatic residues such as phe can provide a large
fixed surface for interaction. here, although not directly in contact
with the b3 binding site, the alanine substitution data suggest
that stabilization of the b-turn made possible by the stacking
interaction of pro-2 and phe-3 contributes to the inhibitory nature
of the peptide. our results re-emphasize the importance of hydrophobic residues in protein–protein interactions, particularly in
small peptides where the role of each residue may be crucial,
and again demonstrate a critical role for aromatic residues at
binding hot spots.
on a larger scale, the exact means by which mab  xxxd53xxx /reopro, and
hence the peptide cyclo-[cpfvc], is able to prevent hantavirus
attachment to integrin b3 is the subject of much speculation. raymond et al. (2) have previously demonstrated that binding of b3 by
pathogenic hantaviruses requires the presence of b3 asp39 in the
context of inactive, bent avb3 integrins. as shown in figure 5b,
asp39 is located at the knee/gnu of b3 and is approximately 80 
from the  xxxd53xxx  binding site (12). based on the available structural
data (35), access to asp39 is likely greatly reduced in the active/
extended b3 conformer. as noted by artoni et al. (12), the  xxxd53xxx  epitope of b3 is adjacent to the rgd binding region and the metal
ion-dependent adhesion site and thus may have allosteric and/or
steric effects on rgd-dependent ligand binding and subsequent
activation. interestingly, it has been shown that  xxxd53xxx  binds more
readily to activated than unactivated platelets (36), with activated
platelets proposed to present integrins in the extended conformation (12). a  xxxd53xxx  driven shift in equilibrium favoring the extended integrin conformation would subsequently reduce the availability of
bent conformers presenting access to b3 asp39. thus, cyclo[cpfvc], if interacting in a manner similar to mab  xxxd53xxx  and reopro,
could interfere with hantavirus binding to avb3, not by directly
blocking the necessary binding site, but by shifting the dynamic
188

equilibrium of integrin conformers toward the activated/extended
state.
development of a small molecule peptidomimetic requires identification of the smallest functional peptide unit capable of inhibiting
the targeted interaction. optimization of our parental peptide,
cyclo-[cpfvktqlc], by alanine scanning and residue deletion identified cyclo-[cpfvc] as a minimized cyclic unit showing inhibition
comparable to the parental peptide. although cyclic tri- and tetrapeptides have been reported (37–41), the cyclic pentapeptide structure reported here may be the smallest possible cyclic peptide
inhibitor of the snv:b3 interaction as demonstrated by our analysis.
as previously mentioned, docking of the solution structure of cyclo[cpfvc] against integrin b3 suggested the necessity of cys-1 and
val-4 in specificity of binding, and both cys-1 and cys-5 are
required for cyclization. although pro-2 and phe-3 make some contribution to the hydrophobic binding capacity of the peptide, the
docked model emphasizes the scaffolding role of these residues.
another cyclic pentapeptide, cyclo(rgdf ¼ n{ne}v), has previously
been demonstrated to be sufficient for binding the rgd recognition
site of avb3 and inhibiting binding by other rgd containing proteins
(42). as cyclo-[cpfvc] clearly is of sufficient size to interact with
the three to five critical residues typically required for blocking of
protein:protein binding sites (34), this cyclic pentapeptide is likely
the smallest peptide moiety capable of inhibiting snv entry via
avb3.
multivalent ligand-receptor binding is important for many systems,
including viral attachment and entry into cells (43,44), and adds to
the complexity of successful inhibitor development. inhibition of
snv entry via avb3 requires blocking a multivalent ligand, i.e., the
snv virion displaying multiple copies of the g1/g2 heteroglycoproteins, interacting with avb3 on the cell surface. presumably each
heteroglycoprotein pair is capable of binding one avb3 integrin,
and subsequently, each virion can potentially bind multiple copies
of avb3. this leaves us with the task of inhibiting a multivalent
ligand with a monovalent cyclic peptide. specifically, 50% inhibition of infectivity requires blocking half of the available receptor
sites (avb3) on the cell surface, some of which may be inaccessible because of steric effects of multivalent ligand-receptor binding
(44). zwartz et al. (45) demonstrated that the ratio of a single dissociation rate (k1) to that of multiple bond dissociation rates (kn),
where n is valency of the ligand, is as follows: k1/kn ¼ log [1.0–
0.51/n]/log [0.5]. this equation indicates that as the valency of a
ligand increases, the off rate decreases, indicative of a lower kd
and higher binding affinity. therefore, although inhibition of the
snv-integrin interaction by cyclo-[cpfvc] occurs at moderate
micromolar concentrations, we expect that kd values for the individual monovalent interactions will prove to be in the near nanomolar range. we have previously demonstrated that a cyclic
peptide with an in vitro ic50 of 970 lm, showed efficacy in an
in vivo mouse model (46,47). these data, together with the specificity previously demonstrated (5), bode well for in vivo efficacy
of this inhibitor and translation to an even more potent peptidomimetic.
finally, among the reasons for selection of cyclic peptides as
potential therapeutic inhibitors of protein–protein interactions are
chem biol drug des 2007; 69: 180–190

nmr structure of a novel anti-hantavirus peptide

the following: (i) cyclic peptides are often poor substrates for
proteases and, therefore, exhibit increased serum half-lives compared with linear peptides; (ii) cyclization may result in increased
potency as cyclic peptides have limited conformational preferences compared with more flexible linear peptides; and (iii) protein–protein interaction sites often involve b-turns, and many
cyclic peptides will contain these, as is the case with cyclo[cpfvc]. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a peptide
inhibitor capable of preventing hantavirus cellular entry via integrin avb3. following presentation of its in vitro inhibitory abilities,
this small inhibitory cyclic peptide has already been useful in
in vivo studies that demonstrate blocking of snv infection. the
tertiary structure of this novel cyclic pentapeptide now serves as
the template for pharmacophore analysis to identify potential
non-peptide organics with oral availability and longer half-life
than the current peptide.
