and caffeine metabolites in equine forebrain
tissues

objective—to determine the presence of adenosine
receptor subtypes a1 and a2a in equine forebrain tissues and to characterize the interactions of caffeine
and its metabolites with adenosine receptors in the
cns of horses.
sample population—brain tissue specimens
obtained during necropsy from 5 adult male research
horses.
procedure—membrane-enriched homogenates from
cerebral cortex and striatum were evaluated by radioligand binding assays with the a1-selective ligand
and
the
a2a-selective
ligand
[3h]dpcpx
[3h]zm241385. functional responses to adenosine
receptor agonists and antagonists were determined
by a nucleotide exchange assay using [35s]-guanosine
5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate ([35s]gtpgammas).
results—saturable high affinity [3h]dpcpx binding
(a1) sites were detected in cerebral cortex and striatum, whereas high-affinity [3h]zm241385 binding
(a2a) sites were detected only in striatum. caffeine
and related methylxanthines had similar binding affinities at a1 and a2a sites with rank orders of drug binding affinities (theophylline > paraxanthine ≥ caffeine
>> theobromine) similar to other species. [35s]gtpgammas
exchange revealed that caffeine and its metabolites
act as pure adenosine receptor antagonists at concentrations that correspond to a1 and  xxxg82xxx 
binding affinities.
conclusions and clinical relevance—results of our
study affirm the presence of guanine nucleotide binding protein linked adenosine receptors (ie, high-affinity a1 and a2a adenosine receptors) in equine forebrain
tissues and reveal the antagonistic actions by caffeine
and several biologically active caffeine metabolites.
antagonism of adenosine actions in the equine cns
by these stimulants may be responsible for some
central actions of methylxanthine drugs, including
motor stimulation and enhanced racing performance.

everyday products, many domestic species are likely to
ingest or otherwise be exposed to these agents and
thereby may contain detectable drug concentrations in
tissues or body fluids. caffeine is the archetype agent
for the methylxanthine class and is considered to produce the broadest range of pharmacologic actions,
including bronchial, cardiovascular, respiratory, and
cns stimulatory effects. because the results of several
studies2-4 indicate that caffeine can delay the onset of
fatigue and increase the capacity for work during prolonged exercise, caffeine use is monitored closely or, in
some instances, banned by agencies that oversee
human and nonhuman athletic competitions. caffeine
has been classified as a class 2 agent in racehorses by
the association of racing commissioners international, with no acceptable amount permitted.
although methylxanthine-related agents have distinct pharmacokinetic properties and elicit a unique
spectrum of pharmacologic actions, in general, these
drugs are considered to interact with a common set of
molecular or cellular targets. three predominant
mechanisms have been described for methylxanthine
action, including mobilization of intracellular calcium,
inhibition of intracellular phosphodiesterase enzymes,
and antagonism of cellular adenosine receptors.5,6
although the results of several studies7-10 have revealed
an association between selected behavioral or cardiovascular effects and the 2 former mechanisms of
action, most of the effects of caffeine appear to derive
from adenosine receptor blockade.11 within the cns, a
link exists between caffeine-induced psychomotor
stimulation and competitive blockade of adenosine
receptors in selected forebrain pathways. in light of
such findings, studies of methylxanthine-induced
behavioral changes have focused primarily on the roles
of cns adenosine receptors.
molecular cloning studies in mammalian tissues
have uncovered 4 major classes of adenosine receptors
that are designated a1, a2a, a2b, and a3.12 results of
complimentary pharmacologic studies13,14 have confirmed the presence of distinct adenosine receptor subtypes in many tissues and have revealed striking differences in the drug binding properties among these
receptors.one interesting and potentially important
observation is the low affinity of a2b and a3 receptors
for the endogenous agonist adenosine. this observation
may be relevant to the action of methylxanthine drugs
and other adenosine receptor antagonists, because
under normal conditions, it appears that extracellular
adenosine concentrations are insufficient to activate a2b
and a3 receptors. in view of this, a1 and  xxxg82xxx 
subtypes are considered the primary mediators of
methylxanthine drug actions in most tissues.11,13

previous reports6,13-15 have described the binding affinities and pharmacologic actions of caffeine and its congeners at a1 and a2a receptors in cns tissues from several species, including rats, mice, guinea-pigs, cows,
and humans. however, similar studies of adenosine
receptors and methylxanthine drug actions have not
been reported for equine forebrain tissues.
nevertheless, in view of concerns over nonmedical uses
of caffeine and related agents as possible performanceenhancing drugs in racing horses, our investigation was
undertaken to delineate the nature of methylxanthine
drug interactions with equine cns adenosine receptors.
materials and methods
tissue preparation—brains were obtained from adult
male horses (thoroughbreds and quarter horses; age range,
3 to 8 years old) that were euthanatized by barbiturate overdosea by personnel of the anatomic pathology service at the
university of florida, college of veterinary medicine. none
of the horses were afflicted with any known cns disease or
dysfunction. following removal, brains were packed in ice,
and samples of cerebral cortex and striatum were dissected,
weighed, and homogenized in 30 volumes of ice-cold trishcl buffer (50mm, ph 7.4) with a tissue homogenizerb at
setting 4 for two 15-second bursts. tissue homogenates were
centrifuged immediately at 48,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°c,
pellets were washed twice by removal of the supernatant
resuspended in fresh cold buffer (30 volumes), and tissues
were recollected by centrifugation. washed tissue pellets
were homogenized in 5 volumes of fresh buffer and stored at
–80°c until use for radioligand binding or nucleotide
exchange assays. samples were analyzed for total protein
according to the lowry method.
radioligand binding assays—radioligand binding
experiments were performed by use of 8-[dipropyl-2,3-3h
(n)]-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine ([3h]dpcpx, 111.6
ci/mmol)c or [2-3h](4-(2-[7-amino-2 (2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol)
([3h]zm241385, 17 ci/mmol)d to label a1 and a2a adenosine
receptors, respectively. for determination of  xxxg81xxx  binding, tissue homogenates were thawed and diluted in cold trishcl buffer (50mm) to a final concentration of 30 to 40 µg
protein/ml (cortex) or 40 to 50 µg protein/ml (striatum).
binding reactions (0.5ml total volume) were performed in
tris-hcl (50mm, ph 7.4) buffer containing adenosine deaminasee (0.1 u/ml) at 25°c for 15 minutes. the binding reaction was initiated by addition of [3h]dpcpx (0.05 to 10nm
final concentration) and terminated by rapid separation of tissue-bound radioligand by vacuum filtration onto glass fiber
filter stripsf with a cell harvester.g filters were rinsed 3 times
with 2 ml of ice-cold buffer, transferred to scintillation vials,
and tissue was digested in 2 ml of naoh (0.2 n). samples
were acidified with excess hcl (0.5 n). and tritium content
was determined by liquid scintillation countingh using a commercial scintillation fluid.i total and nonspecific radioligand
binding was measured in duplicate tubes in the presence of
vehicle (1%  xxxd1896xxx ) or the nonxanthine adenosine receptor antagonist 9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5]quinazolin-5-imine monomethane sulfonatej (cgs15943, 5µm final concentration), respectively.
specific binding was calculated as the arithmetic difference
between total and nonspecific binding and represented > 92%
of the bound radioactivity. for competition binding experiments, membrane suspensions were incubated with a fixed
concentration of [3h]dpcpx (1nm, final concentration) and
9 concentrations of each methylxanthine agent.
ajvr, vol 64, no. 2, february 2003

estimation of  xxxg82xxx  binding in equine forebrain
membranes was performed using the a2a-selective ligand
[3h]zm241385. binding reactions (0.5 ml final volume)
were performed in tris-hcl buffer (50mm; ph 7.4) containing nacl (120mm), kcl (5mm),  xxxg62xxx 
(1 u/ml), and membrane protein (300 to 500 µg) for 30
minutes at 25°c. the binding assay was initiated by addition
of [3h]zm241385 (0.05 to 20nm final concentration) and
terminated as described for [3h]dpcpx binding, except for
the substitution of cold tris-nacl-kcl buffer as the rinse
buffer. for competition binding experiments, membrane suspensions were incubated with a fixed concentration of
[3h]zm241385 (3nm, final concentration) and 9 concentrations of each methylxanthine agent. nonspecific binding was
determined in the presence of cgs15943 (5µm in 1%
 xxxd1896xxx ) and used to estimate specific radioligand
binding as already described.
guanine nucleotide exchange assay—adenosine receptor regulated exchange of membrane-bound guanine
nucleotides was determined in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog guanosine-5'-o-(3-[35s]thiotriphosphate)tetralithium ([35s]gtpgammas, 1,250 ci/mmol)c according to a
modification of a published technique.16 membrane preparations from cerebral cortex (approx 70 µg protein/assay) and
striatum (approx 50 µg protein/assay) were incubated for 20
minutes at 37°c to eliminate endogenous adenosine.
immediately thereafter, membrane homogenates were diluted in tris-hcl (50mm, ph 7.4) containing nacl (80mm),
mgcl2 (4mm), edta (1mm), dithiothreitol (1mm),  xxxd1248xxx  (10µm), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0.5%,
wt/vol), [35s]gtpgammas (0.2nm), and adenosine (0.2nm to
15µm) in a final volume of 300 µl. reaction mixtures were
incubated for 30 minutes at 25°c, and tissue-bound
[35s]gtpgammas was separated by rapid filtration and rinsing as
already described for [3h]dpcpx binding experiments.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of
excess nonradioactive gtpgammask (20µm). to assess the efficacy
and potency of adenosine receptor ligands, each drug was
tested at multiple concentrations alone and in the presence of
adenosine (4µm) to test for possible agonist and antagonist
actions, respectively. data from [35s]gtpgammas exchange experiments were calculated as the percent of maximal druginduced stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas binding relative to the
maximal effect by adenosine.
data analysis—in each experiment, all assays were performed in duplicate tubes, and experiments were repeated
over 4 to 5 separate runs. unless specified otherwise, all
results are expressed as arithmetic means ± 1 sem. for saturation binding experiments, values of specific radioligand
binding were transformed with a computer-assisted curve fitting algorithml into standard scatchard plots (bound vs
bound/free) and used to determine dissociation binding constants (kd) and maximum binding capacities (bmax) for
each radioligand. for competition binding experiments,
transformed data were fitted to a 4-parameter logistic equation by weighted nonlinear regression curve fittingl and used
to determine values of ic50 (drug concentration that inhibits
50% of ligand binding). inhibition binding constants (ki)
were derived from ic50 values according to the relationship
described previously.17 values of kd and ki are reported as
geometric means in view of the log-normal distribution of
these parameters.18 statistical comparisons of drug binding
data were carried out using a student’s t-test or 1-way
anova. a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

results
binding properties of forebrain a1 and a2a adenosine receptors—receptor binding studies were per217

formed in washed homogenates from equine cerebral
cortex and striatum with the a1-selective radioligand
[3h]dpcpx and the a2a-selective radioligand
[3h]zm241385. prior to undertaking binding assays in
equine forebrain tissues, preliminary studies were conducted to identify and optimize appropriate assay conditions (buffer, temperature, incubation time, etc) that

yielded equilibrium binding of both radioligands in tissue homogenates. specific binding of both ligands was
determined to be directly proportional to protein concentration over an 8- to 10-fold range of total tissue
protein (data not shown), and binding was unaffected
following storage of washed tissue homogenates for up
to several weeks at –20°c. specific binding for each

sites in striatal homogenates with a correlation coefficient for the regression line of 0.94.

radioligand achieved a rapid equilibrium (< 10 minutes for [3h]dpcpx and < 20 minutes for
[3h]zm241385) and, under the specified assay conditions, remained stable for > 2 hours. saturation binding experiments were conducted with both ligands in
cerebral cortical and striatal membranes (fig 1). for
the a1-selective ligand [3h]dpcpx, saturable highaffinity specific binding sites were detected in the cerebral cortex and striatum. scatchard analysis of specific
binding data revealed that cerebral cortical
homogenates contained a significantly higher density
of [3h]dpcpx binding sites than striatal homogenates
with apparent bmax values of 972 ± 24 and 580 ± 15
fmol/mg protein, respectively. in contrast, the equilibrium kd values derived from scatchard plots revealed a
2-fold higher binding affinity for [3h]dpcpx in striatum (0.29nm), compared with cerebral cortex
(0.58nm). for both tissues, the linearity of bound versus bound/free plots was consistent with the presence
of a single homogenous population of noninteracting
a1 adenosine receptor binding sites.
a parallel set of experiments was performed with
the a2a-selective radioligand [3h]zm241385, although
no results were presented for cerebral cortical
homogenates because little or no specific binding
could be detected (data not shown). for striatal tissues, [3h]zm241385 bound to a finite population of
high-affinity binding sites (fig 1) with an apparent kd
of 0.9nm. scatchard analysis unveiled a linear binding
relationship with an apparent density of striatal
[3h]zm241385 binding sites (bmax, 274 ± 19 fmol/mg
protein) that was markedly lower than the density of
a1 binding sites in the cortex or striatum. the presence
of high-affinity binding sites for [3h]zm241385 and
[3h]dpcpx in striatal tissue, coupled with the near
absence of [3h]zm241385 binding sites from the cere-

nonradioactive zm241385 (0.1nm to 10mµm) was tested for

membranes (triangles). results are plotted as mean ± sem of

values for zm241385 were 0.99, 0.98, and 0.98 for inhibition of

bral cortex, provided an opportunity for additional
investigations of a1 and  xxxg82xxx  sites within these
tissues. by using the unlabeled form of the a2a-selective ligand zm241385, binding sites labeled with
[3h]dpcpx in cortex and striatum, as well as striatal
sites labeled with [3h]zm241385, were compared with
respect to the ki for this highly selective compound.
zm241385 inhibited striatal [3h]zm241385 binding
with high affinity (apparent ki, 0.48nm; fig 2), a finding that agrees reasonably well with the kd obtained
from direct saturation binding analysis. in contrast,
when tested against [3h]dpcpx-labeled tissues,
zm241385 had nearly 600-fold lower affinity in the
cerebral cortex (apparent ki, 260nm) and striatum
(apparent ki, 275nm). in all cases, the pseudo-hill
slope values were close to unity, thereby lending support to the view that homogenous but separate populations of membrane sites are labeled by [3h]dpcpx
and [3h]zm241385 in equine forebrain tissues. the
high selectivity of zm241385 in our experiments
agrees closely with results reported previously19-22 for
other animal species and indicates that binding sites
identified here represent pharmacologically distinct
adenosine receptor populations.

respectively. competing drugs were tested in duplicate tubes at
8 to 9 concentrations, and results are plotted as mean ± sem
from 3 to 4 independent experiments. best-fit curves were generated by use of a 4-parameter logistic equation.

binding affinities of 4 methylxanthine derivatives (caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine) at
a1 and a2a adenosine receptors in the cerebral cortex

and striatum, respectively. all 4 compounds produced
concentration-dependent displacement of radioligand
from cortical a1 ([3h]dpcpx-labeled) and striatal a2a

thine ≥ caffeine >> theobromine), with theobromine
having the lowest apparent affinity and causing incomplete inhibition at the highest concentration (1.5mm)
that was tested. quantitative analysis of fitted inhibition curves revealed that theophylline had the highest
affinity among the methylxanthine compounds with
apparent ki values of 7 and 16µm at a1 and a2a binding sites, respectively (table 1). with the possible
exception of theobromine, none of the methylxanthine
agents appeared to have any substantial selectivity
toward a1 or a2a receptors, although caffeine and
paraxanthine had modest (approx 2-fold) preference
for a2a receptors, and theophylline had an equally
modest preference for a1 receptors.
adenosine receptor-regulated guanine nucleotide
exchange—previous studies23,24 have established that
drug binding to guanine nucleotide binding protein
(g protein)-coupled adenosine receptors can stimulate
the exchange of gtp or selected analogs that are
bound to the receptor-g protein complex. in view of
this, we used [35s]gtpgammas, a metabolically stable radiolabeled analog of gtp, to delineate the nature of selected drug actions on adenosine receptors in equine forebrain tissues (fig 4). under the conditions already
described, the natural agonist adenosine stimulated
[35s]gtpgammas exchange in homogenates of the cerebral
cortex and striatum in a potent and concentrationdependent manner. significant increases in [35s]gtpgammas
exchange were detected at submicromolar concentrations (as low as 20nm adenosine), and maximal stimulation in both tissues occurred at 10µm adenosine.
fitting of data to a logistic equation revealed modest
differences in the potency and maximal effect by
adenosine in these tissues. specifically, adenosine produced an approximately 3-fold significantly greater
stimulatory effect in the striatum (158 ± 14%), compared with the cerebral cortex (53 ± 9%). in addition,
exogenous adenosine was slightly more potent in striatum as indicated by significant differences in the concentrations that produced a half-maximal (50%) effect
(ec50) in striatum (0.4µm) versus the cerebral cortex
(1.6µm). parallel studies with the nonxanthine adenosine receptor antagonist cgs15943 revealed no significant changes in [35s]gtpgammas exchange when this agent
was tested alone at concentrations up to 1mm.
however, cgs15943 caused a concentration-dependent and total inhibition of adenosine-stimulated
[35s]gtps binding in both tissues with estimated ic50
values of 0.4µm (striatum) and 1.6µm (cerebral cortex). on the basis of these results, [35s]gtpgammas exchange
was used to delineate the intrinsic activities of
methylxanthine-related agents at adenosine receptors
in equine striatum and cerebral cortex. caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine acted as pure
adenosine receptor antagonists in the cerebral cortex
and striatum insofar as all 4 agents caused complete
inhibition of adenosine (4µm)-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas
exchange while causing little or no stimulatory effect
when tested alone. quantitative analysis of the
inhibitory effects by these drugs revealed that, in general, the rank orders of drug potencies were similar to
results obtained from binding studies (table 1; fig 3),
ajvr, vol 64, no. 2, february 2003

although no direct relationship was established
between drug receptor binding and [35s]gtpgammas
exchange.
discussion
the purposes of our study were to demonstrate
the existence of specific high-affinity adenosine receptors in equine forebrain tissues and to evaluate possible actions by caffeine and related methylxanthine
agents on these important cns drug targets. to achieve
this goal, we used 2 conventional pharmacologic
approaches, radioligand binding and guanine
nucleotide exchange assays, as a means to characterize
the drug binding properties and pharmacologic effects
on selected adenosine receptor subtypes. the results
from our study provide the first direct evidence that
caffeine and related compounds act as competitive
antagonists at central equine adenosine receptors and,
furthermore, indicate that the cellular actions of
methylxanthine drugs in horses have striking similarities to actions reported in other species, including
humans.
to identify and study putative adenosine receptors
in equine brain tissues, radioligand-binding techniques
were developed by use of 2 high-affinity ligands that
have been used previously in other animal species.
putative a1 adenosine-receptor binding sites were
studied with [3h]dpcpx, a high-affinity ligand for a1
receptors that binds with > 500-fold selectivity at a1
versus a2a receptors in rat tissues.15,25,26 in equine forebrain tissues, [3h]dpcpx binds with high affinity to
homogenous populations of membrane binding sites in
the cerebral cortex and striatum with affinity constants
(apparent kd values of 0.58nm and 0.29nm for cortex
and striatum, respectively; fig 1) that are within the
range of kd values reported for brain membranes from
other species, including sheep (0.2nm), cows (0.2nm),
rats (0.5nm), hamsters (0.5nm), rabbits (0.7nm), pigs
(0.8nm), and guinea pigs (2.1nm).27 the higher density of [3h]dpcpx binding sites in equine cerebral cortex relative to striatum parallels regional distribution
patterns for a1 receptors in other species,15,25,27 although
the absolute density of a1 binding sites is substantially
higher in the striatum of horses relative to most
species. taken together, our results for [3h]dpcpx
binding in equine brain tissues are consistent with data
reported for other species and provide strong support
for the presence of specific high-affinity a1 adenosine
receptors in the equine cns.
similar experiments were performed by use of the
nonxanthine adenosine antagonist [3h]zm241385 to
identify possible a2a adenosine receptors in equine
cns tissues. on the basis of the results of previous
functional studies,19,20 as well as investigations using
tissues or cell lines derived from rats, guinea pigs,
dogs, and humans,19-22 [3h]zm241385 is considered to
be 1 of the most selective, high-affinity ligands available for labeling a2a adenosine receptors.
[3h]zm241385 labeled a homogenous population of
binding sites in equine striatal membranes that had a
binding affinity (apparent kd, 0.9nm) comparable to
that reported for other species (fig 1).21,22 the large
excess of [3h]zm241385 binding sites in horse stria221

tum relative to cerebral cortex (undetectable in most
samples) also parallels the reported distribution of a2a
adenosine receptors in the forebrains of other mammalian species, although low densities of a2a binding
sites have been detected within rat cerebral cortex.28-30
on the basis of these findings, we conclude that
[3h]zm241385 is a suitable radioligand for labeling
high-affinity a2a adenosine receptors in the equine
cns. nevertheless, in view of the coexistence of substantial amounts of a1 and a2a adenosine receptors in
equine striatal tissues (bmax values of 580 ± 15 and
274 ± 19 fmol/mg protein, respectively), additional
experiments were performed to differentiate the drugbinding properties of these putative receptor subtypes.
under identical experimental conditions, unlabeled
zm241385 was found to inhibit binding of both radioligands in striatum, as well as [3h]dpcpx in cerebral
cortex. however, zm241385 had nearly 600-fold higher affinity for a2a sites, compared with a1 sites labeled
with [3h]dpcpx in striatal and cortical membranes
(fig 2). on the basis of this marked selectivity by a
well-recognized a2a-selective adenosine receptor
antagonist, we conclude that zm241385 represents a
suitable pharmacologic tool for  xxxg82xxx  binding
studies in equine tissues and could easily provide a
useful probe for distinction between a2a and a1 adenosine receptor-mediated effects in horses.

were characterized by use of competitive ligand binding and a functional second messenger-based assay. in
tests for potential drug interactions with a1 adenosine
receptors ([3h]dpcpx binding in cerebral cortex) and
a2a adenosine receptors ([3h]zm241385 binding in
striatum), all 4 methylxanthine drugs had strong
inhibitory actions with all agents except theobromine,
causing complete inhibition of ligand binding. for
both tissues, a similar rank order potency was obtained
with a ranking of theophylline > paraxanthine ≥ caffeine >> theobromine (fig 3). although the absolute
values for drug-inhibition constants (ki values) differed slightly for each drug between horses (table 1)
and other species, overall these agents had no substantial selectivity between a1 and  xxxg82xxx 
subtypes in the equine forebrain. when compared with
similar studies19,21,25,27,28 in other species and tissues,
including rats, cows, and humans, our results reveal
remarkable concordance with drug inhibition constants and rank order potencies for the methylxanthine
drugs across several mammalian species. however,
some discrepancies were observed between our results
and results from several older studies31,32 that used agonist radioligands or ligands with poor binding selectivity profiles for a1 or  xxxg82xxx  subtypes.
despite these minor differences, we conclude that caffeine and 2 of its active metabolites (theophylline and
paraxanthine) bind with high affinity at adenosine
receptors in equine forebrain tissue and, therefore, are
likely to exert substantial pharmacologic actions in the
equine cns.
although radioligand-binding approaches can be
used to determine important quantitative measures of
drug-receptor interactions, it is often impossible to
222

ascertain the functional consequences of receptor
occupancy (ie, agonism vs antagonism) through the
use of radioligand binding studies alone. therefore, to
determine the intrinsic activities of methylxanthine
drugs at equine forebrain adenosine receptors, experiments on function were undertaken on the basis of the
presumed coupling of these receptors with functional
g proteins. studies33,34 in other species have established
that adenosine receptors are coupled to g proteins
through which intracellular signaling pathways may be
regulated. for example, a1, a2a, and a2b adenosine
receptors are likely to associate selectively with distinct
families of g proteins and either inhibit (a1) or stimulate (a2a and a2b) adenylate cyclase activity.13,35,36
although previous studies35 have revealed the utility of
monitoring adenosine receptor-regulated  xxxd1773xxx 
production as a means to characterize drug-receptor
interactions, such measures can be limited by the need
for tissues that are fresh and contain intact viable cells.
in light of these and other limitations, we used adenosine-regulated exchange of the gtp analog [35s]gtpgammas
as a functional measure for drug interactions with
equine adenosine receptors. similar approaches have
been used previously in freeze-thawed or cell-free tissue homogenates and appear to provide a sensitive and
accurate indicator for drug intrinsic activities at adenosine receptors.16,23,24 under our assay conditions, adenosine stimulates [35s]gtpgammas exchange in the cerebral
cortex and striatum (fig 4), which supports the
hypothesis that adenosine receptors are coupled to g
proteins in equine forebrain tissues. although it is
noteworthy that adenosine produces a maximal effect
nearly 3-fold greater in striatum and is slightly more
potent in that tissue, our data provide no clear explanation for this difference. nevertheless, several possible reasons could account for the disparity between
cerebral cortex and striatum. for example, differences
in the concentration of endogenous substances that
regulate [35s]gtpgammas exchange could alter the basal rate
for this process and thereby affect the net response to
exogenous adenosine. in addition, the coupling efficiency between receptors and g proteins could be
greater in striatum, or the combined effect by a1 and
a2a receptors in striatal tissue might supersede the
stimulatory effect mediated by a1 receptors alone in
cerebral cortex. with regard to the latter point, studies16 in bovine tissues have failed to detect any substantial effects on guanine nucleotide exchange by a2a
adenosine receptors. nevertheless, despite these
regional differences, it appears that adenosine-induced
stimulation of [35s]gtpgammas exchange is mediated entirely by specific adenosine receptors in both tissues. this
conclusion is based on the observation that cgs15943,
a nonselective synthetic adenosine receptor antagonist,37 completely blocks the effect of adenosine in both
tissues. using the same approach in our study, all 4
methylxanthine compounds were determined to act as
adenosine receptor antagonists on the basis of their
ability to inhibit adenosine-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas
exchange while having no effect when tested alone.
therefore, in conjunction with results from radioligand binding analyses, our results indicate that caffeine, theophylline, paraxanthine, and theobromine
ajvr, vol 64, no. 2, february 2003

can competitively antagonize adenosine actions in the
equine cns, although their abilities to do so in vivo is
likely to vary owing to differences among their pharmacokinetic profiles.
finally, although our study focused on the interactions of caffeine and its analogs with g protein-coupled
a1 and a2a receptors in the equine forebrain, it is
important to consider additional possible actions by
these drugs. based on evidence obtained from studies34,38 in rodents and other species, there is abundant
evidence that adenosine and adenosine receptors may
have a central role in numerous cns-related phenomena, including sleep-arousal mechanisms, seizure susceptibility, and analgesia. the putative roles of various
adenosine receptor subtypes, including those that
influence neuronal cation-selective channels (notably,
potassium and calcium channels), are complex and
reflect the broad spectrum of functions influenced by
cns adenosine receptors.33,39,40 in addition, blockade of
adenosine a2a receptors within the basal ganglia is now
recognized to disrupt gamma- xxxd2177xxx -mediated
regulation of striatal dopaminergic neurons and thereby alter spontaneous motor activity.41-43 in view of the
broad array of actions associated with adenosine and
its various receptors, it is likely that caffeine actions in
the equine forebrain have a similar degree of diversity
and complexity.
the results of our study provide the first direct evidence that specific a1 and a2a adenosine receptors are
present in equine cns tissues. furthermore, our results
indicate that normal activation of these receptors by
adenosine can be blocked by caffeine, theophylline,
paraxanthine, theobromine, and related methylxanthine analogs and thereby may explain in part some of
the behavioral effects of these agents, including motor
stimulation. although our study does not address any
specific pharmacologic actions by these agents in horses in vivo, previous investigations have affirmed a pronounced motor stimulant effect following systemic caffeine administration.44,45 in view of our results that
reveal potent antagonistic effects by theophylline and
paraxanthine at equine adenosine receptors, the possibility exists for these caffeine metabolites to contribute
substantially to the overall spectrum of cns actions
associated with caffeine administration.
