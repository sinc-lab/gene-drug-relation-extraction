abstract
to evaluate the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxd3274xxx  ( xxxd3274xxx ), a new prostaglandin (pg) f2a derivative, we examined its
receptor-binding affinities, intraocular pressure (iop)-lowering effect, effects on aqueous humor dynamics, and stimulating effect on
melanogenesis. the receptor-binding profile for afp-172, a carboxylic acid of  xxxd3274xxx , was determined by measuring muscle contractions
in an organ bath, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and competitive binding of a radio-labelled ligand. for the iop-measurement study,
ocular normotensive and laser-induced ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys were used, and iop was measured using a
pneumatonograph. for the studies of aqueous humor dynamics, iop (goldmann applanation tonometry), fluorophotometry, two-level
constant pressure perfusion, and isotope dilution and accumulation techniques were used in ocular normotensive monkeys. the melanin
contents in the medium and in the cell bodies of cultured b16-f0 melanoma cells were measured. the affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx  shown by
afp-172 (ki : 0·4 nm ) was 12 times that of phxa85 (ki : 4·7 nm ), a carboxylic acid of  xxxd2446xxx . a single application of  xxxd3274xxx  at
0·0025% significantly lowered iop in both ocular normotensive and hypertensive monkeys (3·1 and 11·8 mmhg, respectively, p , 0·01) and
 xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005% significantly lowered iop (2·1 mmhg, p , 0·01 and 9·5 mmhg, p ¼ 0·059; respectively). once daily instillation of
 xxxd3274xxx  at 0·001, 0·0025, or 0·005% for 5 days in normotensive monkeys significantly reduced iop not only for a few hours, but also at the
drug-trough time 24 hr after application.  xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005% also reduced iop, but not at the drug-trough time.  xxxd3274xxx  decreased iop
mainly by increasing uveoscleral outflow by 65% ðp , 0·05þ and, as sometimes seen with other prostanoids, also increased total outflow
facility (33% increase, p , 0·05). in cultured b16-f0 melanoma cells, afp-172 (100 mm) did not stimulate melanogenesis, but phxa85
(100 mm) did. these findings indicate that  xxxd3274xxx  has a high affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx , has potent iop-lowering effects in both
ocular normotensive and hypertensive monkeys that exceed those of  xxxd2446xxx , and has less stimulating effect on melanogenesis in
melanoma cells.

prostaglandin (pg) f2a analogues (fig. 1).  xxxd3274xxx  is
under development as an ocular hypotensive drug in the
usa, europe, and japan. it is a pro-drug ester that facilitates
corneal penetration and allows delivery of the active
carboxylic acid form (afp-172) to the aqueous humor, a
similar situation to that seen with  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester and
other ocular hypotensive derivatives of  xxxd1902xxx , such as
 xxxd2446xxx .
glaucoma is a major cause of blindness worldwide, and
many ocular hypotensive drugs are in existence. for over 20
years, b-blockers such as  xxxd3377xxx  were the first-line therapy.

fig. 1. chemical structures of  xxxd3274xxx  and afp-172.

then, after the discovery of the intraocular pressure (iop)lowering effects of pgs (camras and bito, 1981), several
pg-derivatives such as isopropyl unoprostone (taniguchi
et al., 1996),  xxxd2446xxx  (stjernschantz et al., 1995; camras
et al., 1996),  xxxd340xxx  (woodward et al., 2001), and
 xxxd3414xxx  (sharif et al., 1999; hellberg et al., 2001) were
launched into the market as anti-glaucoma drugs. the ioplowering effect of  xxxd2446xxx  has been found to be greater
than that of  xxxd3377xxx  in a number of clinical comparative
studies (alm, 1995; mishima et al., 1996; watson et al.,
1996; alm et al., 2000). recently, because of its potent ioplowering effects and fewer general side effects,  xxxd2446xxx 
has been used as first-line therapy in many countries,
including the usa and japan.
prostanoid fp-receptor agonists have potent iop-lowering efficacy, and effectively no general side effects.
however, pg-related ocular hypotensive drugs do have
local side effects, such as pigmentation of the iris (wistrand
et al., 1997; yamamoto and kitazawa, 1997; sherwood and
brandt, 2001; netland et al., 2001), palpebra or/and
periocular skin (wand et al., 2001), and abnormal eyelash
growth (trichiasis) (johnstone, 1997). furthermore, the
existing pg-related ocular hypotensive drugs, including
 xxxd2446xxx , do not produce satisfactory iop control in all
patients. we therefore tried to find a new candidate as an
ocular hypotensive drug that exceeds  xxxd2446xxx  in terms of
iop-lowering efficacy, and has weaker local side effects.
in this study, in a comparison with  xxxd2446xxx , we
examined the binding affinity of afp-172 for recombinant
human prostanoid fp receptors, the binding selectivity of
afp-172, the iop-lowering effects of  xxxd3274xxx  in ocular
normotensive and laser-induced ocular hypertensive monkeys, the effects of  xxxd3274xxx  on aqueous humor dynamics in
ocular normotensive monkeys, and the effects of afp-172
on melanogenesis in cultured b16-f0 melanoma cells.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
 xxxd3274xxx  and afp-172 were synthesized at the laboratories of asahi glass co. ltd (tokyo, japan).  xxxd2446xxx ,

unoprostone isopropyl, and  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester were
purchased from cayman chemical co. (ann arbor, mi,
usa).  xxxd2446xxx  ophthalmic solution (xalatanw) was
purchased from pharmacia k. k. (tokyo, japan), pilocarpine hydrochloride from sigma-aldrich corp. (st louis,
mo, usa), and [3h]  xxxd1902xxx  (200 mci/ml) from amersham
biosciences corp. (piscataway, nj, usa). [125i] and [131i]
were obtained from perkinelmer life sciences, inc.
(boston, ma, usa).  xxxd3377xxx -gel forming ophthalmic
solution ( xxxd3377xxx -xew) was a product of santen pharmaceutical co. ltd (osaka, japan). phxa85 and unoprostone
(carboxylic acids of  xxxd2446xxx  and unoprostone isopropyl,
respectively) were prepared at the laboratories of santen
pharmaceutical co. ltd. because  xxxd2446xxx , unoprostone
isopropyl, and  xxxd3274xxx  are pro-drug esters, and each is
converted to its respective acid by the esterase in the cornea,
the carboxylic acid forms were used in vitro, while the ester
forms were used in vivo.
2.2. receptor-binding assays
2.2.1.  xxxg1878xxx 
for the  xxxg1878xxx -binding study, we used a
clonal cell line that stably expresses the recombinant human
 xxxg1878xxx  (abramovitz et al., 1994). the
radioligand-binding assay was performed according to the
methods of abramovitz et al. (1994) and graves et al. (1995).
in this conventional filtration assay, membranes expressing
the receptor are incubated with a fixed concentration of the
radioligand and increasing concentrations of the test
compounds. after reaching equilibrium, the radioligand
bound to the membranes (bound) is separated from the
unbound (free) radioligand by filtration through glass-fiber
filters. the amount of bound radioactivity is determined by
liquid scintillation spectrometry (ls5000td; beckman
coulter inc., fullerton, ca, usa), and the amount of
bound radioactivity is plotted as a function of the logarithm
of the concentration of the competing test compound.
increasing concentrations of the competing test compound
decrease the binding of the radioligand according to the laws
of mass action, and the affinity (ic50) of the test compound
for the receptor can be determined by non-linear regression
analysis according to
b ¼ non-specific binding
þ

ðtotal binding 2 non-specific bindingþ
1 þ 10log½c2logðic50 þ

where b equals the amount of radioligand-binding at a given
concentration of test compound [c], total binding equals the
amount of radioligand-binding in the absence of test
compound, and non-specific binding equals the residual
amount of radioligand-binding after complete displacement
of specific binding by a saturating concentration of the test
compound.

2.2.2. prostanoid dp, ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, ip, and tp receptors
binding affinity for the prostanoid dp receptor was
determined by measuring the inhibition of the adenosine
diphosphate (adp)-induced aggregation of rabbit platelets.
platelet-rich plasma was prepared from freshly obtained
rabbit blood, and platelet aggregation was induced by 10 mm
adp ( xxxd1704xxx  and whiting, 1989). binding affinities for the
prostanoid ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and ep3 receptors were determined by
measuring muscle contractions in an organ bath. the
muscles, which were attached to an isometric transducer,
were maintained at 378c in aerated (95% o2, 5% co2)
krebs –hensleit solution. for the  xxxg1872xxx ,
contraction of the guinea pig ileum was induced by 1 mm
afp-172 ( xxxd1704xxx  and whiting, 1989), and the contraction
induced by afp-172 was expressed as a percentage of the
maximal response to 10 mm acetylcholine. for the  xxxg1873xxx , contraction of the guinea pig trachea was
induced by 1 mm carbachol, then inhibited by 1 mm afp172. for the prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx , twitch contractions of
the guinea pig vas deferens were induced by electrical
stimulation (1 min interval, 5 sec trains of pulses at maximal
voltage; pulse width, 1 msec; frequency, 5 hz), then
inhibited by afp-172 (savage et al., 1993). the binding
studies for prostanoid ip and tp receptors were performed
by a contract facility (cerep, france) with standard binding
procedures.
2.2.3. other receptors and transporters
the binding studies for other receptors and transporters
listed in table 3 were performed by another contract facility
(daiichikagaku pure chemicals co. ltd, toukaimura,
japan) with standard binding procedures.
2.3. iop measurement
for the studies on ocular normotensive monkeys, 10
adult male cynomolgus monkeys, each weighing 4·7– 7·4 kg
(keari co. ltd, osaka, japan), were used for the singleapplication experiment, and another 10 adult monkeys, each
weighing 4·5 – 8·1 kg (animal care co. ltd, tokyo, japan),
were used for a repeated-application study. only animals
with normal eyes (in terms of anterior chamber, angles, iop,
ocular media, and optic nerve heads) were included in these
studies. for the ocular hypertensive monkey study, 12 adult
cynomolgus monkeys, each weighing 5·2 –8·1 kg (keari co.
ltd, osaka, japan), were used. elevated iop was produced
in the monkeys according to a previous report (lee et al.,
1985), with a minor modification. briefly, ocular hypertension was induced in the left eye by photocoagulating the
trabecular meshwork using an argon laser (ultima 2000;
coherent-japan, tokyo, japan), applying 150 burns around
360 degrees twice with a 1-week interval. the present study
was carried out more than 4 weeks after the last
photocoagulation. if the iop in the photocoagulated eye
was not 5 mmhg greater than that in the non-photocoagulated fellow eye, the animal was not used for this study.

769

before we measured iop, all monkeys were trained for
restraint in a monkey chair (cl-4535; primate products,
miami, fl, usa) and for measurements of iop. for iop
measurements, the monkey was kept in a sitting position in
the monkey chair, and the iop was measured with a
pneumatonograph (model classic 30r; soran ophthalmic,
jacksonville, fl, usa) without any general anesthesia or
sedation. for corneal anesthesia, 0·4% oxybuprocain
solution (santen pharmaceutical co. ltd, osaka, japan)
was topically applied prior to iop measurement. drugs
(20 ml) were applied to one eye in each monkey, with the
contralateral eye remaining untreated. in the normotensive
monkey study (single application), iop was measured just
before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr after drug application. in
the normotensive monkey study (repeated application), iop
was measured just before and at 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr on days 1,
3, and 5 of the drug-application protocol. in the ocular
hypertensive monkey study, drugs (20 ml) were applied to
the left eye with elevated iop in each monkey, at 9 – 10 a.m.
iop was measured just before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr
after drug application. a masked observer (f. n.) measured
iop in all experiments. a crossover design was applied to
these studies; each animal contributed to all groups.
prior to aqueous humor dynamics studies, iop responses
to  xxxd3274xxx  (4 £ 5 ml of 0·005%),  xxxd3377xxx  (2 ml containing
5 mg  xxxd3377xxx ) and  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester (2 £ 5 ml of
0·02%) were confirmed in monkeys anaesthetized with
ketamine hcl (10 mg kg21, i.m.) using a minified goldmann applanation tonometer (kaufman and davis, 1980).
2.4. aqueous humor dynamics assays
for the aqueous humor dynamics study, we used a total
of 28 adult male and female cynomolgus monkeys, each
weighing 2·5– 6·0 kg (the majority from covance inc.,
madison, wi, usa; two from the coulston foundation,
almagordo, nm, usa; one born at the university of
wisconsin, madison, wi, usa). aqueous humor formation
(ahf) was measured in eight monkeys (i.m. ketamine
anesthesia, 10 mg kg21 initial supplemented by 5 mg kg21
as needed) by fluorophotometry (gabelt et al., 1994); total
outflow facility was measured in the same eight monkeys
plus four additional ones (i.m. ketamine (10 mg kg21)
followed by i.v. pentobarbital (15 mg kg21 initial,
supplemented with 5– 10 mg kg21 as needed)) using twolevel constant pressure perfusion (bárány, 1964; gabelt
et al., 1991); uveoscleral outflow and trabecular outflow
were measured in the same 12 monkeys by means of isotope
accumulation (sperber and bill, 1984; gabelt et al., 2003)
prior to outflow facility measurements on the same day.
only animals with normal eyes (in terms of anterior
chamber, angles, iop, ocular media, and optic nerve
heads) were used. in these studies, 4 £ 5 ml of 0·005%
 xxxd3274xxx  was applied once daily for 3 – 5 days; 5 mg
 xxxd3377xxx  (2 ml of  xxxd3377xxx -gel forming solution diluted with
saline) was applied once daily for 3 days; 2 £ 5 ml of 0·02%

770

y. takagi et al. / experimental eye research 78 (2004) 767–776

 xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester was applied twice daily for 4 or 5
days to eight monkeys different from the previous 12;
100 mg/10 ml  xxxd2950xxx  was applied intracamerally to
yet another group of eight different monkeys.
the rate of ahf was determined in ketamine anaesthetized monkeys using a coherent scanning ocular
fluorophotometer (fluorotron master, palo alto, ca,
usa). fluorescein (10%  xxxd2130xxx  for injection, alcon
laboratories, inc., fort worth, tx, usa) was administered
topically on the afternoon preceding the fluorophotometry
experiments (usually five 2 ml drops of 5% solution diluted
with 0·1 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7·4) 5 min after
one drop of 0·5% proparacaine hydrochloride (bausch and
lomb pharmaceuticals, inc., tampa, fl, usa). this kept
the corneal fluorescein concentration at 200 ng ml21 or
more during the measurement period. on the experimental
day, scans were recorded in each eye every hour for 5 hr.
isotopic determination of ahf was performed in
pentobarbital anaesthetized monkeys beginning 3 hr after
the last dose of  xxxd3274xxx  (fourth or fifth dose of once daily
treatments) or  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester (seventh or ninth dose
of twice daily treatments) by circulating [125i] or
[131i]monkey albumin through the anterior chamber and
measuring the dilution of label with newly formed aqueous
(by counting a portion of the circuit every 5 min over a 2 hr
period in a well detector/multichannel analyzer system,
(asa-100 nai multichannel analyzer, genie-2000 spectroscopy software, canberra industries, inc., meriden, ct,
usa). flow through the trabecular meshwork was determined by taking blood samples every 10 min from a femoral
artery and counting them in a gamma counter (cobra
model d5003, packard instrument co., downers grove, il,
usa). uveoscleral outflow was calculated as the difference
between ahf and trabecular outflow.
total outflow facility was determined in pentobarbital
anaesthetized monkeys by two-level constant pressure
perfusion of the anterior chamber with bárány’s mock
aqueous humor, correcting for the internal resistance of the
perfusion apparatus as appropriate (bárány, 1964). for
 xxxd3274xxx  and  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester studies, total outflow
facility was determined for approximately 45 min at the
conclusion of isotope studies and were completed within
hours 5– 6 after the fourth or fifth dose of once daily
treatments with  xxxd3274xxx  or after the seventh or ninth dose
of twice daily treatments with  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester. for
pilocarpine, the anterior chambers of both eyes were
cannulated with a branched needle (with one branch
connected to a reservoir and the other to a pressure
transducer). baseline facility measurements were taken for
35 – 45 min. following baseline measurements, a bolus
injection of 10 ml containing 100 mg  xxxd2950xxx  was
made into the inflow tubing of one eye, bárány’s into the
opposite eye tubing. following a 5-min wash in period
with the reservoirs elevated, cold air was blown on the
corneas to mix the anterior chamber contents by convection.
post-drug outflow facility was then determined for another

35– 45 min. facility was calculated by successive averaging
(bárány, 1964).
2.5. melanogenesis assay
b16-f0 melanoma cells were purchased from dainippon
pharmaceutical co. ltd (osaka, japan). melanin contents
were measured as in previous reports (siegrist and eberle,
1986; kosano et al., 1995). briefly, fourth- or fifth-passage
b16-f0 melanoma cells (atcc no. crl6322; 5 £ 103
cells/well) were seeded in a 24-well plate (asahi techno
glass corp., funabashi, japan) in culture medium (dulbecco’s modified eagles medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and 50 mg ml21 gentamicin). starting the day after
seeding, the cells were cultured for 4 days in culture
medium with or without drug (afp-172 or phxa85).
the culture medium was collected, and the cells dissolved
in lysis buffer (0·1n naoh solution containing 10% triton
x-100) with 10-sec sonication. the melanin content of the
medium and cell lysates was measured by absorbance at 490
and 415 nm, respectively.
2.6. statistical analysis
the following statistical analyses were performed. for
the iop measurement study, the maximal reduction in iop
was used for statistical analysis. a student’s t-test was
carried out following an f-test. dunnett’s test and the
tukey – kramer test were carried out following a one-way
analysis of variance. for the aqueous humor dynamics
study, a two-tailed paired t-test was carried out on the values
obtained for treated/control ratios. p , 0·05 was taken as
statistically significant.

3. results
3.1. receptor-binding assays
3.1.1.  xxxg1878xxx 
prior to the fp binding study, we confirmed the
expression of prostanoid fp receptors in the clonal cells.
immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti- xxxg1878xxx 
antibody, examination of the accumulation of inositol
phosphates induced by fluprostenol, and radioligand-binding competition curve analysis of  xxxd1902xxx  to [3h] xxxd1902xxx 
revealed that the clonal cell line used in this study did
indeed express human fp receptors (data not shown). afp172 showed a high affinity for the human prostanoid fp
receptor, with an ec50 of 0·53 nm . the affinity of afp-172
was 12 times that of phxa85 and 1700 times that of
unoprostone (table 1). afp-172 produced full displacement
of specific [ 3h]pgf 2a binding and competed in a
manner consistent with a simple bimolecular reaction
(hill slope , 1), as did phxa85 and unoprostone.

3.1.2. prostanoid dp, ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, ip, and tp receptors
the inhibitory or stimulatory effects of afp-172 on
the binding or pharmacological responses of prostanoid
receptors are shown in table 2. afp-172 at 1 mm did not show
evidence of inhibitory or stimulatory effects on any receptor
binding, except that of the prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx . the ic50
of afp-172 for the prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  was 67 nm , and
the binding affinity of afp-172 was 126 times weaker for this
receptor than for the  xxxg1878xxx  (see tables 1 and
2).  xxxg1073xxx  (dp), pge2 (ep1), butaprost ( xxxg1873xxx ), 17-phenyl
trinol-pge2 (ep3),  xxxd2331xxx  (ip) and u44069 (tp) were used
as positive controls in each experiment.
3.1.3. other receptors and transporters
as shown in table 3, the inhibitory effects of afp-172 at
1 mm on a variety of receptor and transporter bindings were
all less than 15%.

at 0·0025% was over 3 mmhg, greater than that induced by
 xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005% (which was approximately 2 mmhg,
statistically significant compared to that in the vehicletreated eye). the potency of  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·0005% was
almost equal to that of  xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005%.
3.3. effects of repeated applications of  xxxd3274xxx  on
intraocular pressure in conscious normotensive monkeys
fig. 3 shows time –course data for the effects of repeated
applications of  xxxd3274xxx  or  xxxd2446xxx  on iop in ocular
normotensive monkeys. mean iop values at the pretreatment time in all groups were within a narrow range
(21·5– 22·1 mmhg), and there was no statistically significant difference among the groups. all doses of  xxxd3274xxx 
reduced iop at 4, 6, and 8 hr after their application on days
1, 3, and 5.  xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005% caused significant iop
reductions at 4, 6, and 8 hr after its application on days 1, 3,
and 5. while  xxxd2446xxx  did not reduce iop at the trough
time-point (24 hr after its application; i.e. 0 hr on days 2– 6

in fig. 3),  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·0025 and 0·005% did significantly
reduce iop at each trough time-point from 0 hr on day 3
(24 hr on day 2) through 0 hr on day 6 (24 hr on day 5). even
with  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·001%, an iop reduction at the trough
time-point was observed after 0 hr on day 3 (24 hr on day 2),
and this effect was significant on and after 0 hr on day 4
(24 hr on day 3). fig. 4 shows the daily maximal iop
reductions induced by  xxxd3274xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx . the daily
maximal reductions induced by all doses of  xxxd3274xxx  and
 xxxd2446xxx  increased after day 1, but statistically significant
increases vs. day 1 were observed only with  xxxd3274xxx  at
0·0025 and 0·005%. the maximal iop reductions achieved
with  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·0025 (mean ^ s.e.m. : 4·7 ^ 0·2 and
5·0 ^ 0·2 mmhg at day 3 and 5, respectively, n ¼ 10) and
0·005% (6·1 ^ 0·2 and 5·8 ^ 0·3 mmhg at days 3 and 5,
respectively, n ¼ 10) were greater than that achieved with
 xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005% (4·2 ^ 0·3 and 4·2 ^ 0·4 mmhg at
day 3 and 5, respectively, n ¼ 10).
3.4. effects of a single application of  xxxd3274xxx  on
intraocular pressure in conscious laser-induced ocular
hypertensive monkeys
fig. 5 shows the maximal iop reductions induced by
applications of  xxxd3274xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  in laser-induced
ocular hypertensive monkeys. the mean iop values at the
pre-treatment time in all groups were in the range 35·8–
38·7 mmhg, and there was no statistically significant
difference among the groups.  xxxd3274xxx  (0·00002 –
0·0025%) induced a dose-dependent iop reduction, the
maximal reduction at 0·0025 and 0·005% (11·8 and
10·5 mmhg, respectively,) being statistically significant
compared to that in the vehicle-treated eye (6·2 mmhg).
the effect of  xxxd3274xxx  on laser-induced ocular hypertension
seemed to peak at 0·0025%, then almost plateau. the
maximal iop reduction (9·5 mmhg) seen after application
of  xxxd2446xxx  tended to be greater than that in the vehicletreated eye, but with borderline significance ðp ¼ 0·057þ·

each parameter relating to aqueous humor dynamics in
ocular normotensive monkeys.
by fluorophotometry, once daily application of  xxxd3274xxx 
at 0·005% for 3 days did not affect ahf. on the other hand,
once daily application of  xxxd3377xxx  for 3 days significantly
decreased ahf by 23%.
according to the isotope perfusion data, once daily
application of  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·005% for 4 or 5 days
significantly decreased the flow to blood (ftb) by 22%,
and significantly increased both ahf by 14% and

uveoscleral outflow (fu) by 65%. in this experiment, the
ftb value is assumed to represent outflow through the
trabecular meshwork (conventional outflow).
twice daily application of  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester at
0·02% for 4 or 5 days did not affect ahf, but significantly
decreased ftb by 59% and tended to increase fu (although
not significantly due to variability in the data).
once daily application of  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·005% for 4 or 5
days significantly increased total outflow facility by 33%
compared to contralateral control eyes, but twice daily
application of  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester at 0·02% for 4 or 5
days did not. however, the control eye values in  xxxd3274xxx 
animals tended to be lower than those of the control eyes for
 xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester and pilocarpine; the absolute facility
values for  xxxd3274xxx -treated and  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl estertreated eyes were almost exactly the same. intracameral
application of pilocarpine significantly increased total
outflow facility by 184%.
3.6. effect of  xxxd3274xxx  on melanogenesis in b16-f0
melanoma cells
fig. 6 shows the effects of  xxxd3274xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  on
melanogenesis in cultured b16-f0 melanoma cells. in these
cells, a-melanocyte stimulating hormone increased the
melanin content in both the culture medium and cell bodies
(data not shown). afp-172 at 1 –100 mm and phxa85 at 1
and 10 mm did not increase the melanin content in either the
culture medium or cell bodies. phxa85 at 100 mm
significantly increased the melanin content above that
seen with vehicle.

4. discussion
afp-172, a carboxylic acid of  xxxd3274xxx , showed a potent
affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx , and its affinity was
greater than that of either phxa85, a carboxylic acid of
 xxxd2446xxx , or unoprostone. the binding affinity of afp172 was 126 times higher for the  xxxg1878xxx 
than for  xxxg1874xxx . on the other hand, afp-172 showed
no or less affinity for other prostanoid receptors (dp, ep1,
 xxxg1873xxx , ip and tp) and other receptors and transporters. afp172 also contracted the isolated cat iris sphincter muscle and
its efficacy was greater than that of phxa85 (nakajima
et al., 2003). these findings indicate that the binding profile
of afp-172, like that of phxa85, is that of a selective
agonist for the  xxxg1878xxx  (stjernschantz et al.,
1995). since the structural characteristics of  xxxd3274xxx  and
afp-172 involve two fluorine atoms in position 15 in the bchain of the prostaglandin structure, its fluorine atoms may
bestow a more potent affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx 
than that exhibited by other pg derivatives.

in ocular normotensive and laser-induced ocular
hypertensive monkeys. a single application of  xxxd3274xxx

 xxxd1902xxx -ie: prostaglandin f2a-isopropyl ester; aqueous humor formation (ahf) was calculated from the dilution of fluorescein or 125i-albumin in the
anterior chamber. total outflow facility for  xxxd3274xxx  and  xxxd1902xxx -ie was measured at the conclusion of isotope studies by two-level constant pressure perfusion.
flow through the trabecular meshwork was determined from the radioactivity in the blood. uveoscleral outflow (fu) was taken as the difference between
aqueous formation and trabecular outflow; data represent the mean ^ s.e.m. for ratio values, *p , 0·05; ** p , 0·01 for difference from 1·0 (two-tailed paired

induced a dose-dependent iop reduction in conscious ocular
normotensive monkeys. the peak time for the iop
reduction induced by  xxxd3274xxx  was 8 hr after its application,
similar to  xxxd2446xxx . the duration of the iop reduction
seen with  xxxd3274xxx  was greater than that seen with
 xxxd2446xxx . once daily applications of  xxxd3274xxx  led to
progressive increases in the daily maximal iop reduction
and in the iop reduction at the trough time-point (just
before the next application). these effects at the trough
time-point were not observed with  xxxd2446xxx . these results
indicate that the iop-lowering effect of  xxxd3274xxx  is stronger
and more continuous than that of  xxxd2446xxx  in the monkey.
 xxxd3274xxx  also induced an iop reduction in laser-induced
ocular hypertensive monkeys, in which the iop reductions
induced by  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·0025 and 0·005% were statistically
significant, and greater than that of  xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005%.
taken together, the above results suggest that the ioplowering effect of  xxxd3274xxx  might be greater than that of
 xxxd2446xxx  in the clinic as well.
the mechanism underlying the iop-lowering effect of
 xxxd3274xxx  was investigated in ocular normotensive monkeys.
the methods used in this study were validated by their
ability to detect the effects of positive controls, such as
 xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester and pilocarpine.  xxxd3274xxx 
decreased the flow to blood (ftb, conventional outflow)
and increased the uveoscleral outflow. the effect of afp168 on ahf was similar by the different methods: increases
of 10% by fluorophotometry (not significant) and 14% by
isotope perfusion (significant). compared to the increase in
uveoscleral outflow, this increase in ahf is relatively small.
therefore,  xxxd3274xxx  may affect ahf slightly, as do the
other  xxxd1902xxx  analogues (lindén and alm, 1997; brubaker

et al., 2001).  xxxd3274xxx  also decreased ftb, presumably due
to rerouting of flow to the uveoscleral pathway. among the
four ways to reduce iop (decrease in ahf, increase in
conventional outflow facility (increase in ftb at any
constant pressure), increase in fu, or decrease in episcleral
venus pressure (evp)),  xxxd3274xxx  increased fu and total
outflow facility, but did not decrease ahf or increase ftb.
thus, the primary mechanism underlying the iop-reducing
effect of  xxxd3274xxx  is via an increase in uveoscleral outflow,
as with other pg derivatives (stjernschantz et al., 1995).
simultaneously measured vehicle-treated contralateral eyes
are the best controls for drugs not expected to act
systemically, so the effect, whether on the uveoscleral or
the trabecular outflow pathways, is likely to be real. in any
case, the effect on facility, although significant by this

measure, is still very small compared to that of pilocarpine.
also, the total outflow facility increase seen with  xxxd3274xxx 
in the current study is not different than the total outflow
facility effect sometimes seen with  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester in
other studies which subsequently demonstrated that the
effect was not on trabecular outflow facility (gabelt and
kaufman, 1990). the increase in total outflow facility might
be due to an increase in uveoscleral facility. there is still
controversy over whether or not fu may become more
pressure sensitive with pgs (toris and pederson, 1987;
gabelt and kaufman, 1990; becker and neufeld, 2002; bill
et al., 2003). techniques to unequivocally measure
uveoscleral facility are needed to determine whether this
is responsible for the increases in total outflow facility that
are sometimes found.
phxa85 increased melanogenesis in cultured b16-f0
melanoma cells, but afp-172 did not. although the
concentration of phxa85 needed to achieve such an effect
was extraordinarily high, it may indicate that  xxxd2446xxx 
can induce melanogenesis. application of  xxxd2446xxx  for
several months causes alterations in iris or periocular skin
colour through the induction of melanogenesis (wistrand
et al., 1997; yamamoto and kitazawa, 1997; wand et al.,
2001). therefore, the incidence of iris or periocular colour
change may be expected to be lower with  xxxd3274xxx  than
with  xxxd2446xxx . further studies will be needed to clarify
the difference.
in conclusion, afp-172, a carboxylic acid of  xxxd3274xxx ,
exhibited a high and selective binding affinity for the
 xxxg1878xxx , and did not affect melanogenesis in
cultured b16-f0 melanoma cells. furthermore, the maximal
iop reduction achieved with  xxxd3274xxx  at 0·0025% was
greater than with  xxxd2446xxx  at 0·005% in both normotensive and ocular hypertensive monkeys. in its pharmacological characteristics,  xxxd3274xxx  may be superior to  xxxd2446xxx :
potent iop-reducing efficacy and weak melanogenetic side
effect.
