abstract
most antipsychotics were thought to induce antipsychotic action at an excess of 70% striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, while the
clinical dose of clozapine was reported to show less than 60% occupancy. high-dose clozapine could occupy as high as 80% of striatal
 xxxg656xxx  in monkey pet studies. although the time course of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is an important property of
antipsychotics, that by clozapine has not been investigated in a clinical setting. we measured the time course of extrastriatal dopamine d2
receptor occupancy with different doses of clozapine and evaluated whether the measured occupancies fitted the binding theory. three
consecutive pet scans with [11c]flb 457 were performed for two patients with schizophrenia, chronically taking 600 mg/day and 200 mg/
day of clozapine, respectively. series of occupancies were also measured in combination with fluvoxamine or paroxetine in one patient.
 xxxg656xxx  occupancies were also simulated using individual clozapine plasma data and previously determined in vivo ed50
value. the occupancy of one patient with high plasma concentration (1207 ng/ml at peak time) was around 75% at peak and around 60%
after 26 h. another patient with medium plasma concentration (649 ng/ml at peak time) showed less than 50% occupancy at peak, decreasing
to 15% after 25 h. the measured occupancy values fitted well with the simulated occupancy values. at high plasma concentration, clozapine
can induce high extrastriatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in the human brain, and this finding fitted well with the theoretical estimation.

the degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy by
antipsychotics in living human brain (farde et al., 1992;
kapur et al., 1999). more than 70% of striatal dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  is reportedly occupied by therapeutic doses of
antipsychotics (farde et al., 1992; kapur et al., 1999).
however, less than 60% occupancies have been reported
with the therapeutic doses of clozapine and quetiapine
(farde et al., 1992; nordstrõm et al., 1995; kapur et al.,
1999), and different binding sites or endogenous dopamine
have been considered to contribute to these low occupancy
values (farde et al., 1989; pilowsky et al., 1997; van tol
et al., 1991). a transient high  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy has been shown for quetiapine (kapur et al.,

76

a. takano et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 30 (2006) 75 – 81

2000). the time course of receptor occupancy is recognized as one of the important characteristics of drugs.
haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, has been
reported to show a high level of striatal dopamine d2
receptor occupancy for more than 1 day (nordstrõm et al.,
1992). we have reported that high-dose clozapine could
induce as high as 80%  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in
a monkey striatum (suhara et al., 2002b), and like other
antipsychotics, the occupancy value of clozapine has been
suggested to follow the law of mass action (nyberg et al.,
2002).
on the other hand, extrastriatal dopamine d2 receptors
are thought to be common sites of action of antipsychotic
drugs (farde et al., 1997; lidow et al., 1998), and we
have reported the extrastriatal  xxxg656xxx  data in drugnaı̈ve schizophrenia using [11c]flb 457 (suhara et al.,
2002a).
in this study, we aimed to measure the time course of
extrastriatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancies in patients
treated with high and medium doses of clozapine, and we
compared those values with simulated ones from individual clozapine plasma concentrations and previously
determined in vivo ed50 value.

2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
two male patients (patients a and b) aged 30 and 32
years who met the dsm-iv criteria (american psychiatric
association, 1994) for schizophrenia participated in this
study. the patients were recruited from the outpatient
units of hokkaido university hospital (sapporo, japan).
although clozapine has not yet become commercially
available in japan, clozapine treatment had been continuing for several schizophrenic patients, including patients a
and b, who responded to clozapine in a phase ii trial in
japan. patient a was treated with 600 mg/day (3  200
mg) of clozapine for 4 years and patient b with 200 mg
of clozapine daily for 4 years. patient a underwent
consecutive pet scans under three different conditions. in
the phase ii trial, he started taking 50 mg of clozapine
after tapering other antipsychotics such as haloperidol and
olanzapine. clozapine was then increased up to 600 mg
for the treatment of somatic hallucination and obsessive
symptoms. since the obsessive symptoms did not improve
despite the high-dose clozapine, fluvoxamine was added.
the first series of pet scans was performed about 6
months after starting 200 mg of fluvoxamine. fluvoxamine was then switched to 40 mg of paroxetine because
of insufficient effect on the obsessive symptoms, and the
second series of pet scans was performed about 6
months later. paroxetine was finally tapered because the
obsessive symptoms were not cured. the third series of
pet scans, again about 6 months later, was performed

without any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssris).
after explaining the study, written informed consent was
obtained from each patient. this study was approved by the
ethics and radiation safety committee of the national
institute of radiological sciences, chiba, japan.
2.2. radioligand
precursors for the synthesis of [11c]flb 457 were
kindly supplied by astra arcus (sweden). [11c]flb 457
was synthesized by o-methylation of the corresponding
precursors with [11c]methyliodide with high specific
radioactivity, which was obtained by a reduction of
[11c]co2 with lialh4 in an inert atmosphere with
specially designed equipment (halldin et al., 1995; suzuki
et al., 1990). the radiochemical purities were more than
95%.
2.3. scanning procedure
ecat exact hr+(cti-siemens, knoxville, tn,
usa) was used to follow the radioactivity. the system
provides 63 planes and a 15.5-cm field of view. to minimize
head movement, a head fixation device (fixster, stockholm,
sweden) was used. a transmission scan for attenuation
correction was performed using a 68ge – 68ga source.
acquisitions were made in 3d mode with the interplane
septa retracted. a bolus of 195.4 – 316.0 (mean t s.d.;
244.2 t 38.7) mbq of [11c]flb 457 with high specific
radioactivities (95.1 –289.7 gbq/amol) was injected intravenously from the antecubital vein with a 20-ml saline flush.
dynamic scans were performed for 80 min immediately
after the injection.
patient a took 600 mg of clozapine on the day before,
and on the first pet scan day he took 300 mg at 8:00 a.m.
the first pet scan was performed  xxxd1891xxx :00 a.m. (2 h after
clozapine), the second at 3:00 p.m. (7 h after), and the third
 xxxd1891xxx :00 a.m. the next day (26 h after). during these 2 days,
blood samples were taken 14 times to measure the plasma
concentrations of clozapine and prolactin. patient a
followed the same schedule of three consecutive pet scans
when he was also taking 200 mg of fluvoxamine t.i.d. or 40
mg of paroxetine q.d.
patient b was asked not to take his usual clozapine dose
the night before the first pet scan day. he was also asked to
desist from taking clozapine until the completion of all three
pet scans once they had started. because he opted to take
another 200 mg of clozapine on the first pet scan day
earlier (the dosage he would normally take that evening), the
total dose on this day became 400 mg. thus, he took 200
mg of clozapine at 8:00 a.m. and again at 11:00 a.m. on the
day of the first pet scan, which was performed at 12:00
a.m. (1 h after second dose). the second scan was done at
5:00 p.m. (6 h after) and the third at 12:00 a.m. on the next
day (25 h after). during these 2 days, blood samples were

a. takano et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 30 (2006) 75 – 81

taken 17 times to measure the concentrations of clozapine
and prolactin.
after the series of pet scans, both patients resumed their
usual clozapine regimens.
2.4. analysis of pet data
all emission scans were reconstructed with a hanning
filter cut-off frequency of 0.4. the tissue concentration of
radioactivity was obtained from regions of interest (rois)
defined on the pet images of summated data for 80 min
with reference to the available individual mr images and
brain atlas. the regions were the prefrontal cortex,
temporal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellar cortex. circular
rois were set at 8-mm diameter to cover 7 slices for the
cerebellum, 6 slices for the thalamus and 10– 11 slices
for the prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex. the average
values of right and left rois were used to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio for the calculations. quantification
was performed using a three-parameter simplified reference tissue model (lammertsma, 1996). the cerebellum
was used as the reference tissue because of its practically
negligible density of dopamine d2 receptors (suhara et
al., 1999). this model allows the estimation of binding
potential (bp), which was defined as the ratio of receptor
density (b max) to dissociation constant (k d). dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy of clozapine was estimated using
the following equation: occu = (bpnaı̈ve  bpdrug)  100 /
bpnaı̈ve, where occu is the percentage occupancy, bpnaı̈ve
the binding potential of the patient in the drug-naı̈ve
state, and bpdrug that of the patient taking the drug. since
we could not perform pet scans in a drug-naı̈ve state in
this study, the mean bps in the prefrontal cortex
(0.95 t 0.19), temporal cortex (1.79 t 0.26), and thalamus
(3.31 t 0.30) of eleven drug-naı̈ve patients with schizophrenia (age range 19 –40 years; mean t s.d., 28.1 t 7.9
years) reported in our previous study (suhara et al.,
2002a) were used as bpbaseline.
2.5. plasma concentration of clozapine
plasma concentration of clozapine was measured by
means of high-performance liquid chromatography with
electrochemical detection (lovdahl et al., 1991). the
time course of plasma concentration after peak time was
fitted to one-exponential function. from the fitted
equation, the half-life of the plasma concentration was
obtained.
2.6. simulation study
the simulated time course of receptor occupancy was
calculated using the plasma kinetic data and in vivo ed50
values (takano et al., 2004). the relationship between
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy and plasma concentration of antipsychotics was expressed by the following

77

equation (fitzgerald et al., 2000; kapur and remington,
1996):
d2

occu

¼ 100  d=ðed50 þ dþ;

ð1þ

where d2 occu is  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, d is
the concentration of the drug in proximity to the
 xxxg656xxx , and ed50 is the concentration to
induce 50% occupancy.
the change in plasma concentration after peak concentration was expressed by the following equation (gefvert et
al., 1998; tauscher et al., 2002):
c ¼ m ebt ;

ð2þ

where c is plasma concentration, m is the simulated
maximal plasma concentration at 0 h, b is a constant, and
t is the time after the drug administration.
plasma concentration was used as functional surrogate of
d (fitzgerald et al., 2000; kapur and remington, 1996).
therefore c = d.
combining (1) with (2),
d2

¼ 100  m ebt = ed50 þ m ebt



ð3þ

the time course of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy by clozapine after
peak plasma concentration was estimated from the plasma
concentration of clozapine in this study and the in vivo ed50
value of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, which was set between 400
ng/ml and 600 ng/ml with reference to the reported data
(nordstrõm et al., 1995; kapur et al., 1999; nyberg et al.,
2002).

3. results
3.1. time course of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy by
clozapine
for patient a without ssris, the mean extrastriatal
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy of three regions (prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and thalamus) was
73.7 t 8.7% (mean t s.d.) at 2 h, 75.5 t 4.3%  xxxd2274xxx  h, and
59.5 t 10.2% at 26 h. for patient b, the mean occupancy
was 45.6 t 3.3% at 1 h, 43.4 t 2.3% at 6 h, and 16.8 t 6.2%
at 25 h (fig. 1a).
the concentration of clozapine reached a peak (1207
ng/ml at 3 h after last administration of clozapine in patient
a without ssris, and 649 ng/ml at 6 h after in patient b),
and decreased with a half-life of approximately 21 h for
patient a and 11 h for patient b (fig. 1b). although the
plasma concentration of prolactin remained within normal
range (1.5 – 9.7 ng/ml) during the experiment, a peak (5.9
ng/ml in patient a and 9.0 ng/ml in patient b) was
observed to approximately coincide with the peak of
clozapine (fig. 1c).

78

(1207 ng/ml). the concentration of clozapine decreased with
a half-life of approximately 18 h with fluvoxamine and
approximately 21 h with paroxetine (fig. 2b).
the plasma concentration of prolactin showed a peak
(4.9 ng/ml with fluvoxamine and 6.7 ng/ml with paroxetine)
at about the peak of the plasma concentration of clozapine
(fig. 2c).

4. discussion

79

4.2. time course of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
the time course of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy for
patient b was relatively fast, similar to the reported time
course of quetiapine (kapur et al., 2000). however, the
change in the occupancy with time was small in patient a,
as could be expected from the relative plateau portion of the
saturation hyperbola. the shape of the saturation hyperbola
has been discussed since the reported plateau portion did not
exceed 70% (nordstrõm et al., 1995; kapur et al., 1999);
several possible reasons have been proposed, such as
different binding site(s) or effect of endogenous dopamine
(farde et al., 1989; pilowsky et al., 1997; van tol et al.,
1991). however, our results suggested that the saturation
hyperbola of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy by clozapine
could also follow the general binding theory. simulation of
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy using plasma elimination
data of clozapine and ed50 value derived from previous
studies (nordstrõm et al., 1995; kapur et al., 1999)
indicated that the estimated occupancy values were similar
to the measured ones. in this simulation study, the expected
maximal receptor occupancy was 100%.

4.1.  xxxg656xxx  occupancy by clozapine
in this study, high extrastriatal  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy was demonstrated in a patient with high plasma
concentration of clozapine. previous clinical pet studies
reported that clozapine could induce only limited striatal
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy, around 50% (nordstrõm
et al., 1993), and extrapolated maximal occupancy was
reported to be less than 70%. although several studies
have reported a large inter-individual variety in the plasma
concentration of clozapine (olesen et al., 1995), the
majority of clinical cases showed less than 1000 ng/ml
(kapur et al., 1999). in the present study, the peak
concentration of clozapine was 1207 ng/ml without ssris
and 2051 ng/ml with fluvoxamine (patient a). we recently
reported that clozapine induced a high occupancy of
 xxxg656xxx  in the monkey striatum after a
bolus injection of high-dose clozapine (suhara et al.,
2002b). in the monkey study, 5 mg/kg of clozapine was
administered as bolus injection, equivalent to approximately 1500 ng/ml of plasma concentration and comparable to about 1200 mg of human oral dose. another
monkey pet study showed 87 –89% of striatal dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy after a 20-mg/kg injection of
clozapine, corresponding to 2800 mg of human oral dose
(nyberg et al., 2002).
the patient with a medium concentration level of
clozapine (patient b) showed approximately 50% of
extrastriatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, similar
to the previous results for striatal dopamine d2
receptor occupancy (kapur et al., 1999). taken together, the previous results of low occupancy could be
attributed to a concentration of clozapine insufficient for
saturation.

4.3. extrastriatal and striatal  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy
we did not measure striatal occupancy because [11c]flb
457 is not appropriate for striatal measurement (olsson et
al., 1999). we combined the data from three regions
(prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and thalamus) in this
study, as only two subjects were measured and the data were
not enough for discussing regional differences. extrastriatal
occupancy data might not be simply comparable to the
striatal data, as a difference in occupancy by clozapine
between the striatum and cortical region has been reported
(pilowsky et al., 1997). however, an absence of significant
difference in  xxxg656xxx  occupancy has also been
reported in clozapine-treated patients (talvik et al., 2001).
clozapine was reported to have minimal effect on the
prolactin level (kane et al., 1981). however, our results
indicated a transient but marked effect on prolactin
secretion, consistent with a recent report (turrone et al.,
2002).
4.4. co-administration of ssris
regarding the co-administration of ssris, they were
added to treat obsessive symptoms of patient a. although
fluvoxamine can be used to augment clozapine (olesen and
linnet, 2000), it reportedly elevates the plasma concentration of clozapine by inhibition of the catalyzing enzyme
cyp1a2 (hiemke et al., 1994). in this study, the plasma
concentration of clozapine was 1.7 times higher with
fluvoxamine compared to that of clozapine only. in this
sense, paroxetine has a relatively low risk to increase the
plasma concentration of clozapine (wetzel et al., 1998).

80

a. takano et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 30 (2006) 75 – 81

since repeated administrations of ssris such as citalopram and fluoxetine reported to have some effects on
[11c]raclopride binding in healthy volunteers (tiihonen et
al., 1996; penttila et al., 2004), the possible effects on
[11c]flb 457 binding by fluvoxamine or paroxetine could
not be ruled out. however, the effect would be minor since
[11c]flb 457 is not sensitive to endogenous ligand
(okauchi et al., 2001).
4.5. study limitations
there are several limitations to this study. first, the
number of subjects was certainly insufficient for reaching
any firm conclusions \ a situation that can in part be
blamed on the fact that clozapine is not commercially
available in japan. second, occupancies were calculated
using the mean value of other patients with schizophrenia,
and this might result in calculation errors. if the bp values
at baseline or drug-free state changed by 20% of the value,
which was within s.d. of bp of the 11 drug-naı̈ve
schizophrenia patients (suhara et al., 2002a), 75% of
occupancy, for example, would be changed to 69% or to
79%. third, recently it has been reported that the use of
the cerebellum as a reference region implies the risk of
error in the occupancy estimation. however, the error
estimated by occupancy using srtm would be within 5%
(olsson et al., 2004). fourth, it can be the effect of the
injected mass of [11c]flb 457 which was 0.7 t 0.3 ag
(0.4 –1.1), which could occupy less than 10% of receptor
occupancy in extrastriatal regions.

5. conclusions
this preliminary study showed that high dopamine d2
receptor occupancy can be induced with a high plasma
concentration of clozapine in the patients. this indicates that
the binding property of clozapine might not be special in
terms of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. however, the
antipsychotic mechanism of clozapine at the usual clinical
dose with low  xxxg656xxx  occupancy still
remains to be studied.
