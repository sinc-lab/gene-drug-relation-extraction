introduction
 xxxd3522xxx  was discovered by henrik dam in 1929 (43) in studies of chicks fed
fat-free diets . he observed quite unexpectedly that some of the chicks de­
veloped hemorrhages under the skin, in muscle, and in other tissues and that
blood, taken for laboratory examinations, showed delayed coagulation (42).
this delayed coagulation was discovered to be due to an absence of prothrom­
bin activity in plasma (223). similar observations were made in 193 1 by
mcfarlane and his co-workers ( 1 65) in canada and shortly afterward by holst
& halbrook ( 1 07) of the university of california. the early work on the
isolation and structural determination of both  xxxd3522xxx  and  xxxd1875xxx  (5 1 )
ushered i n a period of study of prothrombin and other  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
factors . over the period from 1950-1974, various hypotheses about the action
of  xxxd3522xxx  included a role in mitochondrial electron transport ( 1 57), a
possible function as an inducer of protein synthesis ( 1 85), and finally a role as
an agent for posttranslational modification of a prothrombin precursor protein
(240) .
the discovery of 'y-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) in bovine prothrombin inde­
pendently by stenflo (240) , nelsestuen et al ( 1 79), and magnusson et al ( 1 49)
revolutionized ideas about the function of  xxxd3522xxx . since this modified
amino acid was absent from prothrombin that circulated in the blood of animals
given the anticoagulant  xxxd1875xxx  (stenflo 240) it was concluded that vitamin
k was involved in the 'y-carboxylation of glutamate in a prothrombin precursor.
gla residues were first identified in a tryptic peptide containing residues 4- 1 0
o f prothrombin. further enzymatic degradation o f this peptide yielded a tet­
rapeptide containing residues 6-9 [leu-glx-glx-val] (243). proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (ms) showed
that both  xxxd2431xxx  residues in this peptide had one extra carboxyl group on
their 'y-carbon atoms (73). the corresponding peptide from  xxxd1875xxx -induced
prothrombin had unmodified  xxxd2431xxx  residues in these positions. as
shown in figure i , this new amino acid is a  xxxd2537xxx  derivative that is stable
in base but labile in hot acid. this property may explain why it was not detected
earlier in amino acid sequencing studies by the edman technique.
the presence of gla in another peptide from fragment 1 of prothrombin was
reported by nelsestuen et al (1 79), who identified a gla ser dipeptide,
representing residues 33 and 34 of prothrombin. magnusson ( 147) , who had
been studying the amino acid sequence of bovine prothrombin for many years,
also noted the abnormal anodal mobility of tryptic peptides representing
prothrombin residues 4- 10 and 4- 1 1. in 1974 magnusson et al ( 1 49) presented
the amino acid sequence of the first 42 residues of bovine prothrombin. gla
residues were found at positions 7, 8, 15, 1 7 , 20, 2 1 , 26, 27 , 30, and 3 3 . thus
the first 10  xxxd2431xxx  residues in the n-terminal sequence of prothrombin

the remainder of the molecule.
in addition to the four classical  xxxd3522xxx -dependent coagulation proen­
zymes, factors ii, vii, ix, and x, shown in table 1 , four additional ,,-carboxy
containing coagulation factors have been isolated over the past four years .
these are protein c (239),  xxxg1850xxx  (50), protein m (226) , and protein z (207) .
all have an amino acid sequence homologous to that of prothrombin for
residues 1 -40 ( 1 06) , and all require calcium ions for activity. protein c
contains two chains, a light chain of 1 55 amino acids and a heavy chain of 260
amino acids containing three carbohydrate side chains (72, 242). in addition to
1 1 gla residues in positions 6, 7 , 14, 16, 1 9 , 20, 23, 25 , 1 26, 29, and 35 of the
light chain of protein c , a (3-hydroxyaspartate was identified at position 7 1
(52). the heavy chain is the serine hydrolase portion of the molecule and is
homologous with factors ix and x .
protein c inhibits coagulation and promotes fibrinolysis (30) . activated
protein c rapidly and selectively inactivates both normal and thrombin­
modified factors v and viii in vitro ( 1 54) . the plasma of subjects with the rare
heritable combined deficiency of factors v and viii completely lacks an
inhibitor of  xxxg1847xxx  ( 1 55). the rate of  xxxg749xxx  inactivation by
 xxxg1847xxx  is enhanced by  xxxg1850xxx  in the presence of phospholipid
(274) .
proteins s and z seem to be homologous with prothrombin in the n-terminal
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent portions ofthe peptide but possibly not in the c-terminal
portion where serine hydrolase activity has not yet been detected.  xxxg1850xxx 
contains 10 and protein z 1 3 gla residues. protein m , which appears to

promote prothrombin conversion to thrombin, has not been as extensively
studied .
 xxxd3522xxx  function and metabolism have been reviewed extensively since
the landmark papers appeared in 1974 describing the isolation of "1carboxyglutamate from bovine prothrombin ( 1 49 , 1 79 , 243). these reviews
have sought to interpret the crescendo of papers that appeared in the wake of the
discovery of gla (87, 1 1 7 , lsi, 193, 246, 248 , 254).
it is the purpose of the present review to bring biomedical students and
investigators up to date on recent discoveries and concepts that characterize this
fast-moving field. the nomenclature for the k vitamins used in this review is
that of the iupac-iub commission on biochemical nomenclature ( 1 1 4).
biosynthesis of prothrombin

from gene to mrna
expression of the biological information coded in eukaryotic genes is made
possible by synthesis of a messenger rna (mrna) from the dna by enzyma­
tic transcription. this process involves generation of a complementary heter­
ogeneous rna transcript followed by extensive splicing and modification to
yield a mrna with a 5' cap of the general structure 7-methylguanosine­
(5' )ppp-(5' )xpyp, where x and y are the first two nucleotides of the coding
sequence, followed by the other nucleotides in the coding sequence , and
eventually by a 3' -poly(a) tail of 40-200 residues. the mrna is then secreted
into the cytoplasm where it is taken up by ribosomes , either free or attached to
the endoplasmic reticulum, and translated into a protein with a specific amino
acid sequence. the mrna of proteins destined for secretion is attracted to
ribosomes that become attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer)
via a leader sequence of amino acids that permits internalization of nascent
peptide in the rer (23 , 24). these events permit further posttranslational
modification of the peptide during the trip down the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum to the golgi apparatus, which, by exocytosis, secretes the protein
into the plasma.
these tenets of molecular biology have been shown to be pertinent to the
biosynthesis of prothrombin and the other  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins,
which undergo posttranslational carboxylation of selected  xxxd2431xxx  res­
idues in the n-terminal portion of the nascent chain followed by glycosylation
at three asparagine residues located at positions further down the chain.
although prothrombin is one of the most abundant coagulation glycoproteins
present in plasma (at a level of about 100 flg/ml) , its mrna constitutes only
about 1 % of the total mrna in bovine liver compared to 10% for bovine serum
albumin ( 1 44).
the level of rna in liver made it difficult to purify prothrombin mrna to
the degree of homogeneity required for many biochemical investigations.

macgillivray et al ( 145) , however, increased the percentage of mrna for
prothrombin by specific immunoprecipitation of bovine liver polysomes to
enhance the concentration of the desired mrna by 8-20-fold with a 30% yield.
complementary dna (cdna) was then synthesized from the enriched mrna
fraction by reverse transcriptase and an oligodt primer. a double-stranded
cdna was made in two steps, trimmed with appropriate enzymes, and 9 dcmp
residues were added to the 3' terminus. it was then annealed to pbr322 dna
that had been cleaved at a ps+i site and similarly tailed with  xxxd1837xxx . the
resulting plasmids were used to transform e coli strain rri .
several recombinant plasmids were found to contain cdna inserts coding
for prothrombin. the dna sequence of the longest contained a 700 base-pair
insert that coded for the carboxyl-terminal sequence of 1 60 amino acid residues
from prothrombin. the sequence from residue 423-583 corresponded closely
to that determined by magnusson and his co-workers ( 1 48) for bovine
prothrombin. the stop codon uag was followed by a noncoding region of 119
base-pairs and a poly(a)-tail of 60 base-pairs.
in a subsequent investigation, degen et al (49) characterized a cdna of
2005 base-pairs coding for human prothrombin isolated from a cdna library
prepared from human liver mrna by methods similar to those described above
for bovine prothrombin. this cdna clone coded for a leader sequence of 36
amino acids, for the 579 amino acids in mature prothrombin, a stop codon, a
noncoding region of 97 base-pairs, and a poly(a) tail of 27 base-pairs. the
leader sequence of the cdna studied corresponded to an incomplete hydropho­
bic signal sequence of 27 amino acids without an n-terminal methionine start
site, followed by a 9 amino acid basic pro-segment containing 4 arginines,
which was joined to the bonafide n-terminal alanine of mature human
prothrombin. when macgillivray et al ( 143) had earlier translated an enriched
mrna for bovine prothrombin in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of
radioactive amino acids , they found a sequence of 23 amino acids preceding the
n-terminal alanine of mature bovine prothrombin. residues - 16 to -6 of this
bovine mrna translation product were identical to residues - 36 to -26 of the
human leader sequence. it is likely, therefore, that the human signal sequence
is 7 amino acids longer than the cdna insert provides information for and that
the pro-sequence in the bovine cdna is shorter.
the pro-segment of human prothrombin mrna is compared with that of rat
 xxxg124xxx  in table 2. the 6-residue pro-segments for rat and bovine serum
albumin are identical in length and sequence (214, 247). the pro-segment for
human prothrombin is longer (9 residues) and more basic, and the pro-segment
for bovine prothrombin is shorter but may be homologous. although mrna
for rat prothrombin has been enriched and translated in a reticulocyte lysate
system to yield an immunochemically detectible prothrombin of mol wt 75 ,000
on sds-polyacrylamide gels, the sequencing of the n-terminal portion is still
incomplete ( 175).

degen et al (49) also isolated a �-phage bearing a human dna insert of 5
kilobases by cdna hybridization with a human fetal liver genomic dna
library . by subcloning and sequencing. it was determined that this fragment
contained half the gene for human prothrombin. which included six introns and
five exons coding for amino acids 1 44-448 of human prothrombin. thus the
human gene for prothrombin. like those for many other mammalian proteins.
contains interrupted noncoding sequences that. when transcribed as heter­
ogeneous mrna. must undergo considerable excision and splicing before a
translatable mrna is obtained (i).

processing of nascent peptide to mature prothrombin
the translation of the mrna for
prothrombin results in the formation of a nascent peptide that consists of a
signal pre-segment of 1 8-34 amino acid residues. a basic pro-segment of 5-9
residues. a coding segment of 579-584 residues. and a stop codon. followed by
a nontranslated tail-segment. as shown in figure 2. until the stop codon is
reached the peptide remains attached to the ribosome and is considered to be a
nascent peptide. the posttranslational modifications. namely 'y-glutamyl car­
boxylation and glycosylation. occur normally on the nascent chain ( 1 1 3).
a protein with an n-terminal extended amino acid sequence preceding the
amino acid sequence expressed in the mature protein is generally called a
preprotein. this leader sequence. which permits entry of the nascent peptide
into the membrane, is promptly cleaved by a signal peptidase on the lumenal
side of the rer . if, in addition, the nascent peptide contains another adjacent
n-terminal sequence necessary for proper folding ( xxxg1193xxx ) or some other
physiological need (proalbumin). the original translation product is called a
preproprotein. with prothrombin we have a problem in nomenclature because
the mature protein is called a "proprotein" because of its role as a precursor for
thrombin. logically, the mrn a translation product for prothrombin should be
called a pre-pro-prel-pre2-prothrombin in which the pre i and pre2 states denote
prothrombin precursors uncarboxylated and unglycosylated. for simplicity i
suggest that the initial translation product for prothrombin be called prepro­
prothrombin with the acarboxy- and aglycosyl-intermediates called simply
metabolism of the signal sequence

figure 2 structure of human prothrombin. a linear model of the nascent peptide is shown at the
top. it has three components, a pre-segment of 34 amino acids,a basic pro-segment of 9 amino
acids,and a coding portion of 579 amino acids. the pre-segment is cleaved by a signal peptidase on
the lumenal side of the rer. the pro-segment is cleaved (in part) in the ser and totally in the golgi
apparatus . the second linear drawing shows the mature prothrombin secreted into plasma,which
has an n-terminal alanine and a c-terminal  xxxd2431xxx . the thrombin portion is crosshatched.
prothrombin is split at arginine 271 by activated  xxxg741xxx  to generate prethrombin-2,which is
converted into an  xxxd2299xxx -chain,disulfide-linked thrombin by a second  xxxg741xxx . clip at arginine
320. the thrombin formed autocatalytically splits prothrombin and fragment 1,2 at arginine 156 to
yield prethrombin-i and fragments i and 2 . the 10 gla residues in fragment i are at positions 7,8,

15,17,20,2 1,26,27,30,and 33 .

"precursor forms". in fact, multiple intermediate forms of immature prothrom­
bin have been found in the endoplasmic reticulum of  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats
(59, 94, 174).
"i-carboxylation scheinbuks (221) and olson et a1 (187) observed that
when rat liver microsomes from  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats were incubated with
reduced menaquinone-2, cycloheximide, and nah 1 4c03 for 1 0 min at 37°c,
followed by fractionation of the rer, 2% of the incorporated 1 4c02 was in the
heavy polysome fraction. this radioactive 1 4c02 , furthetli!ore, sedimented
with the polysomes in csci gradients . thirty percent of this radioactivity could
be released from the ribosomes by incubation with low concentrations of
 xxxd3041xxx ,  xxxg679xxx  ( xxxg679xxx ) , and gtp. analysis of these ribosomes
for prothrombin by radioimmunoassay revealed that one molecule of prothrom­
bin was present per 1000 ribosomes . eighty percent of the radioactivity in this
prothrombin migrated on dowex columns with gla after basic hydrolysis, and
about one half of that was found in  xxxd2431xxx  after acid hydrolysis. van
buskirk & kirsch (270) also reported the presence of gla in ribosomes from
animals and wheat germ.

coagulation proenzymes, is an intrinsic membrane protein liberated only by
detergents and is concentrated in the rer. its properties and mechanism of
action, to the extent they are known, are discussed in the next section. it acts to
carboxylate all of the  xxxd2431xxx  residues from 7 to 33 in prothrombin. after
residue 33, none of the remaining 33  xxxd2431xxx  residues in the protein is
carboxylated. the specificity of the enzyme for given  xxxd2431xxx  residues
may involve a macromolecular recognition phenomenon-i.e. the conforma­
tion and/or location of the precursor protein in the membrane, rather than a
given amino acid sequence.
the sites of carbohydrate attachment to prothrombin
appear to be aspargine residues 78, 100, and 373, all of which have the
adjoining sequence of asn-x-thr, where x equals any other amino acid. this
sequence is associated with the action of protein-oligosaccharyltransferase in
the rer, the enzyme that transfers an n- xxxd2683xxx -branched man­
nose-glucose-containing oligosaccharide from dolichol to asn residues in the
biosynthesis of glycoproteins. further processing of the oligosaccharide by
removal of glucose residues and addition of  xxxd2683xxx  residues
occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. the terminal sialic acid residues
of the carbohydrate side chains are added in the golgi apparatus just prior to
secretion ( 176). meeks & couri ( 1 66, 1 67) have cl aimed that warfarin blocks
and  xxxd3522xxx  stimulates the carbohydrate attachment to prothrombin in rat
liver. it is likely, however, that this is a secondary event in the rat , an animal
that does not secrete a mature prothrombin in the presence of warfarin.
coumarin drugs do not block the attachment of carbohydrate to acarboxy­
prothrombin in animals that secrete an acarboxyprothrombin.
glycosylation

suttie reported in 1 973 (249) that a precursor protein that did not
bind calcium and did not yield thrombin with  xxxg741xxx  accumulated in the
microsomes of warfarin-treated or  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats. it could be liber­
ated with triton x-loo and would produce thrombin when treated with echis
carinatus viper venom. this accumulated microsomal precursor protein could
be carboxylated by injection of  xxxd3522xxx  into anticoagulated rats resulting in
its conversion to prothrombin and secretion into the plasma. this finding also
proved that the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase could recognize detached
nascent chains in the  xxxd3522xxx -deficient reticulum.
several proteins have now been isolated from the livers of warfarin-treated
rats (59 , 94, 172, 230) that have properties consistent with incompletely
processed prothrombin. they are glycoproteins immunochemically similar to
prothrombin with molecular weights indistinguishable from those of rat
prothrombin on sds-polyacrylamide gels. both electrophoretic and isoelec­
tric-focusing analyses indicate that these precursor proteins are less negatively

charged than prothrombin. they range from pi 5.8 to 7 . 2 . specific proteolysis
of these precursors by echis carinatus viper venom or thrombin yielded
fragments indistinguishable from those formed by similar proteolysis of
prothrombin. these proteins do not contain a full complement of gla residues
(usually less than 4 per mol) and do not absorb to bas04 . these proteins also
lack sialic acid residues. the increased basic nature of these proteins is a
property of the amino-terminal region of the molecule and probably reflects the
extent to which the pro-segment of the nascent peptide is retained .
the fully carboxylated, glycosylated, and secreted prothrombin has a pi of
5 . 0 . desialylated prothrombin has a pi of 5 . 5 (178) . at ph 8.0 the ten gla
carboxyl groups should provide ten negative charges on the protein, which
should make the isoelectric point of the mature protein more acidic than its
acarboxy-precursor. this, however, does not occur, and secreted acarboxy­
prothrombin (usually called abnormal prothrombin) has the same isoelectric
point and mobility on disc gel electrophoresis as does normal mature prothrom­
2
bin. if ca + is added, however, the anodal migration of normal prothrombin is
slowed somewhat ( 1 76, 240, 245). this indicates that the extra "(-carboxyl
groups of normal prothrombin are not available externally and are probably
salt-linked to basic groups in the interior of the molecule.
munns et al ( 1 74) observed that confluent monolayers of h-35 hepatoma
cells respond to  xxxd3522xxx  addition by the synthesis and secretion of mature
prothrombin. as demonstrated by radioimmunassay, selective barium salt
adsorption, and two coagulation assays that discriminate between precursor
and mature prothrombin, these cells retained their ability to synthesize precur­
sor prothrombins in the absence of exogenous phylloquinone. when phyllo­
quinone was added to the medium ( 1 00 ng/ml), the existing intracellular
concentration of preprothrombin was reduced to 50% within 1 hr after exposure
to the vitamin and slowly declined thereafter to approximately 30% of control
levels by 36 hr. concomitant with the rapid loss of intracellular preprothrombin
was the appearance of mature prothrombin in the medium.
in a subsequent study , graves et al (96) labeled the precursor prothrombins
3
in h-35 rat hepatoma cells with [ h]-leucine for 2 hr in the absence of vitamin
k and then isolated them by immunospecific adsorption to rat prothrombin
antibodies coupled to sepharose . five distinct e h)-leucine-labeled precursors
of mature prothrombin were identified possessing pi values of 5.5 , 5 . 8 , 6.2,
6 . 7 , and 7.2 as determined on isoelectric focussing gels. all of these precursors
of mature prothrombin had (a) immunochemical similarity , (b) inability to be
adsorbed by insoluble barium salts, (c) common molecular weights of
-75 ,000, and (d)  xxxd3522xxx  dependency. when cells were labeled with
3 [h]-leucine in the presence of  xxxd3522xxx , there was a marked reduction (70%)
of intracellular pi 7 . 2 and 6.7 species and a moderate reduction (35%) of pi 6.2,
5.8, and 5 . 5 forms with a concomitant appearance of mature prothrombin in the

cell culture medium (pi value of 5 .0, mol wt 75 ,000) . the results showed that
 xxxd3522xxx  accelerated the rate of synthesis and/or processing of precursor
prothrombins resulting in the secretion of mature prothrombin molecules into
the medium.
graves, grabau , and munns (95) showed that an analysis of the distribution
of radioactivity incorporated into each precursor during a short (5-10 min) and
long (120 min) radioactive pulse of cells maintained in the presence and
absence of  xxxd3522xxx  provided an insight into the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
processing step. these data indicated that the presence of  xxxd3522xxx  signifi­
cantly altered the percentages of radioactivity incorporated in the 6.7 and 7 . 2
precursor species . during a 10-min pulse the presence of  xxxd3522xxx  increased
by 50% the radioactivity associated with the 7 . 2 precursor while decreasing by
25% the radioactivity incorporated into the 6.7 species . furthermore, the pi 6.7
species was associated with the rer, the pi 7 . 2 and 6.2 species with the ser,
'
the pi 5 . 8 and 5 . 5 species with the golgi apparatus, and the pi 5 . 0 with the
secreted product . it appears that the pro-segment of the prothrombin precursor
is not fully removed until the peptide reaches the golgi body as is also the case
with  xxxg124xxx  (214) .
animals and birds vary in the extent to which the acarboxyprothrombin in
 xxxd3522xxx -deficient or warfarin-treated organisms is processed by enzymes of
the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted into plasma as a biologically inactive
prothrombin . in the human (88) , the cow, (36) and to a lesser extent the chicken
(36, 89 ,), fully glycosylated acarboxyprothrombin appears in the plasma. the
corresponding precursor prothrombin in the chick has not yet been character­
ized, but it is likely that it bears a similar relationship to plasma prothrombin in
the chick, which has only 30% of the biological activity of rat prothrombin and
contains no sialic acid (281).
the finding that the  xxxd3522xxx -deficient chick accumulates only 24% as
much precursor per gram of liver as the rat explains the heretofore puzzling
difference in the relationship between  xxxd3522xxx  action and prothrombin
secretion in the two species.  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats given  xxxd3522xxx  show a
marked "burst" of prothrombin secretion in the first hour, followed by a slower
rate of plasma enrichment (12, 191, 250) .  xxxd3522xxx -deficient chicks , on the
other hand, show a linear response to the vitamin (192). second, the action of
 xxxd3522xxx  in the deficient rat is only partially inhibited by cycloheximide and
 xxxd3041xxx  (12 , 191, 250) whereas in the chick it is completely inhibited (184,
192, 282) . since the chick secretes an acarboxy form of plasma prothrombin,
whereas the rat does not (36, 173), the chick accumulates much less precursor
in its liver than the rat and hence is more dependent than the rat upon ribosomal
synthesis of precursor to sustain prothrombin secretion in response to vitamin
k. it appears that the human and the cow resemble the chick in this regard more
than the rat (36, 116, 245).

immunochemical detection of abnormal prothrombins
ganrot and nilehn (88) first demonstrated the presence of a protein in the
plasma of human subjects receiving  xxxd1875xxx  that reacted to antibodies against
human prothrombin but did not demonstrate any biological activity in a stan­
dard clotting assay using  xxxg741xxx  and thromboplastin. this protein has been
given different names by various investigators: protein induced by  xxxd3522xxx 
absence (pivka), abnormal prothrombin, isoprothrombin, paraprothrombin ,
 xxxd1875xxx -induced prothrombin , atypical prothrombin , acarboxyprothrombin,
or des-')'-carboxyprothrombin. since the extent of carboxylation of this group
of ,),-carboxy glutamyl-deficient prothrombins varies under different conditions
of anticoagulation, "abnormal prothrombin" is used here to denote plasma
variants and "precursor prothrombin" is used to denote immature forms in
microsomes.
the initial studies of abnormal prothrombin (176, 240, 245) indicated that it
appeared to have the same molecular weight and amino acid composition as
normal prothrombin, that it was not adsorbed by insoluble barium salts as was
normal prothrombin, and that it lacked biological activity in the standard
clotting assay . the lack of barium salt adsorption and calcium-independent
mobility in electrophoresis (240, 245) suggested a difference in calcium­
binding properties of these two proteins, which was demonstrated by nelses­
tuen & suttie (177). the difference in calcium binding was shown by stenfio
(241, 244) to be a property of the prothrombin fragment 1 (figure 2), and the
fact that this abnormal prothrombin yielded thrombin when treated with trypsin
or snake venoms indicated that the c-terminal portion of the molecule was
normal. it was shown (62) that the abnormal prothrombin will not bind to a
phospholipid surface in the presence of calcium ions and that the addition of
phospholipid, which drastically stimulates the xa-ca2+ activation of
prothrombin , has no effect on the rate of activation of abnormal prothrombin. a
study (16) of the conformation of these two proteins by optical rotatory
dispersion and circular dichroism revealed that they were indistinguishable in
the absence of calcium ion. on the addition of calcium ions , however, spectral
changes occurred in normal prothrombin as a result of gla residues that were
not seen in the abnormal prothrombin.
the early studies (176, 240, 245) of abnormal prothrombin indicated that its
carbohydrate content and structure were similar if not identical to those of
normal prothrombin and provided refutation of earlier claims ( 1 19, 197) that
the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent step in the formation of prothrombin involved gly­
cosylation of the protein.
furie et al (84, 85) reported that antibodies directed against the ')'­
carboxyglutamic acid-rich region of bovine prothrombin could be isolated
from antisera raised in rabbits immunized with native bovine prothrombin. by
using sequential immunoabsorption on sepharose-bound prothrombin frag-

ments, a population of antibodies was identified specific for the region of
prothrombin from amino acid residue 12 to residue 44, which contains eight of
the ten gla residues present in prothrombin. these anti-( 1 2-44)n antibodies
form soluble complexes with prothrombin and inhibit the conversion of
prothrombin to thrombin in plasma. the anti-( 1 2-44)n antibodies are igg
immunoglobulins that are heterogeneous with regard to charge and affinity for
prothrombin. a subpopulation of anti-( 1 2-44)n is calcium-dependent and
binds prothrombin strongly only in the presence of cach . these anti-( 1 2-4 4)n
antibodies appear to be specific for a metal-stabilized conformation of the
region 1 2-44 in prothrombin and do not cross-react with the region 1 2-44 in
abnormal prothrombin. these results suggest that the ca(ii)-dependent struc­
tural transition of prothrombin involves, in part, alteration of the tertiary
structure of the region 1 2-44.
blanchard et al ( 19) then sought to find specific antibodies against abnormal
prothrombin by immunizing rabbits against abnormal prothrombin from war­
farinized calves . by selective immunoabsorption on sepharose-bound des-'y­
carboxy-fragment 1 and prothrombin, respectively, a purified antibody sub­
population was found that bound abnormal prothrombin but did not cross-react
with normal bovine prothrombin. the interaction of these antibodies with
abnormal prothrombin was not affected by the presence of calcium ions. the
2
interaction of these antibodies with 1 51-labeled abnormal prothrombin was
inhibited by the plasma obtained from a calf treated with warfarin but was not
significantly inhibited by normal bovine plasma, human plasma obtained from
a patient treated with warfarin, or normal human plasma. these studies indicate
that human and bovine abnormal prothrombins do not share antigenic determi­
nants against which these antibodies are directed, nor is abnormal prothrombin
a significant component of normal bovine plasma.
blanchard et al (22) then developed similar conformation-specific antibodies
against human prothrombin, abnormal human prothrombin, and human pre­
thrombin 1 . the anti-prethrombin bound prothrombin and abnormal prothrom­
bin equally. standard radioimmunoassays were developed with 1 251_
prothrombin, 1 251 -abnormal prothrombin, and 1251-prethrombin 1 and applied
to the assay of human plasma. the correlation between the concentration of
mature prothrombin by immunoassay and prothrombin activity by clotting
assay was 0.99. no abnormal prothrombin was detected in normal subjects. in
patients treated with warfarin, abnormal prothrombin ranged from 20 to 90% of
total prothrombin. patients treated with warfarin have multiple populations of
partially carboxylated forms of prothrombin circulating in their blood (64). in
the plasma of patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy blanchard et al (22)
found small but consistent concentrations of abnormal prothrombin compo­
nents exist that bind poorly to anti-abnormal prothrombin and anti­
prothrombin:ca(ii) .

the assays described offer new ways to diagnose disorders associated with
abnormalities of prothrombin biosynthesis. as reported previously, low levels
of abnormal prothrombin circulate in the plasma of patients with liver disease
(20). since this antigen is not detectable in normal plasma, it may serve as a
useful antigenic marker of abnormal liver function or  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency .
furthermore, these immunoassays are a much more sensitive measure of
clinical and subclinical  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency than the prothrombin time. these
assays also show promise for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy (21). for
example, 89% of patients with a bleeding or thrombotic complication during
warfarin therapy were identifiable with the assay of prothrombin antigen. only
33% would have been predicted to be at risk on the basis of the prothrombin
time. finally, these investigators have shown that abnormal prothrombin is an
antigenic serum marker for primary hepatic carcinoma, present in 93% of the
73 patients tested (138) .

carboxylase

distribution
although it was originally assumed that gla residues would be found only in
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent plasma coagulation proenzymes, a search for this new
amino acid in other proteins has revealed a broader distribution than in the
coagulation system. likewise, a survey oftissues has indicated that the vitamin
k-dependent ,),-glutamyl carboxylase is distributed in tissues other than the
liver. as already mentioned , in addition to the four classical  xxxd3522xxx ­
dependent coagulation factors, four new gla-containing plasma proteins with
various roles in coagulation have been discovered since 1974, all of which
appear to be synthesized in the liver (60) . it is not known, however , whether a
single  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase is responsible for the posttranslational
modification of each of these eight factors or whether a family of isozymes
accomplishes these carboxylations . all of these proteins have a homologous
sequence in the n-terminal region of the native protein and contain 10-13 gla
residues.
a  xxxg260xxx  (bgp) was discovered independently by hauschka et al
(102) and price et al (204). this protein is a matrix protein , is extractable from
bone with edta , makes up 20% of edta extractable protein, and represents
1 % of total bone protein. the harvard group has called this protein osteocalcin.
the amino acid composition and sequence have been determined by price (206)
in calf, swordfish, and human. the bgp for calf and human bone has a
molecular weight of 5700 and contains 49 residues , of which residues 1 7 , 2 1 ,
and 24, clustered around a disulfide bridge , are gla. the swordfish protein is
homologous with 47 residues. none of these proteins is homologous with the

coagulation factors, but all bind ca + and particularly hydroxyapatite. its
precise function in bone metabolism is not known:
microsomes from embryonic chick bone contains a  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
'y-glutamyl carboxylase that can carboxylate endogenous bone protein and
glu-containing pentapeptides ( 136). the synthesis of bgp in embryonic chick
and calf bones is inhibited by warfarin (87, 1 80). the synthesis of bgp,
furthermore, is regulated by 1 ,25-dihydroxyvitamin 03 in cultured osteosarco­
ma cells (203). this suggests that bgp may mediate some action of vitamin 0
on bone. while the present data show that a deficiency of bgp does not affect
bone structure or fracture repair, plasma bgp is elevated in metabolic bone
disease (205) and may stimulate bone modeling and mobilization of calcium .
a protein closely related to bgp has been found in calcified atherosclerotic
plaques (atherocalcin) ( 134, 204) and in calcified aortic valves ( 135).
in 1 976, lian & prien ( 137) reported the presence of another gla-containing
protein in the matrix of calcium-containing renal stones in humans. it was
reported to have a molecular weight of 1 8 ,000 and to contain three to four
residues of gla. it may function to solubilize calcium salts in urine . in 1 976
hauschka et al ( 1 0 1 ) demonstrated that menaquinone-3 stimulated the synthe­
sis of 14c-gla from 14c02 in kidney microsomes from  xxxd1875xxx -treated
animals, and friedman et al (79) have localized this synthesis to the tubular
cells. gla biosynthesis has also been demonstrated in a mouse renal adenocarci­
noma in tissue culture (266).
bell (6) and buchthal et al (32. 33) have reported that  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
'y-glutamyl carboxylase is present in micro somes from liver, lung, kidney,
testes, spleen , and several tumors (melanoma, mammary gland, most cell and
lymphomas) for rats and mice . liver was the most active by a factor of 2-3 .
vermeer et al (27 1 , 273) found the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent 'y-glutamyl carboxy­
lase in liver, testes, kidney , spleen , thyroid, pancreas, thymus, cartilage , and
bone from horses and cows. no activity was found in muscle, heart, or
lymphocytes .

requirements
the requirements of crude systems for  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylation
have been reviewed ( 193 , 2 1 7 , 248). postmitochondrial supernatant suspen­
sions and isolated microsomes from liver carboxylate their endogenous k­
dependent factor precursors in the presence of oxygen , hcoi , nao(p)h or
ott and phylloquinone or a range of menaquinones from  xxxg1373xxx  to mk-io.
menaquinone- l had a reduced activity and 2-methyl- l ,4,-naphthoquinone and

enhanced the biosynthesis of prothrombin in postmitochondrial supernatant
suspensions but not in more purified systems (228).

lase system could be solubilized in dilute solutions of triton x-ioo, which
extracted both the precursor protein and the enzyme (6 1 ,92, 1 09, 1 46, 1 90).
the solubilized preparation retained many of the properties of the membrane­
associated system requiring oxygen,bicarbonate, either nadh plus  xxxd3522xxx 
or  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone, but had higher requirements for  xxxd3522xxx  and o2,
did not require atp, and was unaffected by the inhibitory atp analogs.
the requirements of this enzyme system as currently known are summarized
in table 3 . the substrate can vary from a simple substituted  xxxd2431xxx 
(n-t-boc- xxxd2431xxx -a-benzylester) to precursor prothrombin containing
579 amino acids. pentapeptides developed by suttie et al (253) and by houser
et al ( 109), including phe-leu-glu-glu-val, phe-leu-glu-glu-leu, and phe­
leu-glu-glu-lie , have been used successfully. rich et al (2 1 0) have studied a
large number of related peptides and have observed a range of carboxylation
activities, with none being significantly better than phe-leu-glu-glu-leu. the
km for these peptides is 4-6 mm. oxygen is required for half-maximal activity
at a  xxxg2324xxx  of about 60 mm hg for the solubilized enzyme (256),but  xxxg2324xxx  is only
1 0 mm hg for microsomes ( 1 20). this latter level is higher than that required
for half-maximal activity of cytochrome oxidase but similar to that reported for
cytochrome p-450-dependent cholesterol 7-a-hydroxylase (28). carbon diox­
ide is required and appears to be the proximal reactant rather than bicarbonate
( 1 2 1 ) . the km for bicarbonate was found to be 0.2-0 .4 mm . atp and biotin
are not required, and avidin has no effect on the reaction. the apparent km for
 xxxd3522xxx  in microsomes plus cytosol is about 0 . 1 ij.m ( 1 20),whereas in the
solubilized system the apparent km for vitamin kh2 is about 4 ij.m (98). this

purification
attempts to purify the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent 'y-glutamyl carboxylase by a
variety of methods have not been very fruitful. ion exchange resins, chaotropic
ions, sulfhydryl binding columns, thrombin affinity columns, hydrophobic
affinity columns , and gel filtration in various combinations have provided' some
purification but not to a homogeneous protein. affinity columns employing
 xxxd3522xxx  homologs and analogs have not been useful because of the relatively
low affinity of the enzyme for  xxxd3522xxx  or even vitamin kh2• attempts to
purify the enzyme by reacting immunospecific adsorbants with its substrate
preprothrombin have been partially successful since the enzyme and its sub­
strate are closely associated and purify together. it has been extraordinarily
difficult to remove the substrate from the enzyme when this enzyme-substrate
complex is partially purified . in all these attempts the peptide carboxylation
system was used as a guide to purification (186). several methods for partial
purification of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase are described below.
capture of enzyme-substrate complex
in 1978 houser et al ( 1 1 0)
reported the partial purification of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase from
liver microsomes from  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats by using affinity columns for
the substrate of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase. this procedure involved
the isolation of the rough reticulum from crude microsomes, followed by
partial purification of the enzyme substrate complex on a heparin affinity
column. heparin binds the prothrombin precursors , which are tightly associ­
ated with the carboxylase . the enzyme-substrate complex was eluted with
hypertonic salt in a single set of fractions. at this stage there was an approxi­
mate l00-fold purification of the enzyme from whole microsomes with a yield
of 11 % . when the heparin eluate was then rechromatographed on a prothrom­
bin antibody affinity column, 50% of the enzyme now appeared in the void
volume with some continuing retention of the enzyme substrate complex on the
column. the increase in specific activity in this last step was about 3-fold to
yield a product that was 285-fold purified from initial microsomes. this final
fraction, however, represented only 2% of the original activity and was very
unstable on storage . by subjecting the partially purified enzyme to isoelectric
focusing it was possible to identify one peak that contained all the carboxylase
activity and represented a further 3-fold purification, but unfortunately the
isolation of this protein was not possible in the presence of ampholytes (186).
the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase-substrate complex was also purified
about 400-fold from crude microsomes by girardot et al (90, 91) using a

ammoniol)- l -propane sulfonate detergent (chaps) was used to solubilize
liver microsomes from  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats . the soluble mixture was
precipitated by 55% ammonium sulfate and the proteins resuspended in buffer
and applied to a column of ultragel aca-34 previously equilibrated with buffer.
fractions able to carboxylate both added peptide and endogenous protein were
eluted in a smooth peak, which was rechromatographed on carboxymethyl­
sepharose to yield fractions about 350-fold purified. the final step was chro­
matography on a hydrophobic column (leu-glu-glu-leu-phe-ach-48) to
yield a fraction of carboxylase-substrate complex 4oo-fold purified. the
ko:c02 ratio increased from 1.6 to 4.0 during the purification. cytochrome
p-450 activity was absent from this final product. radioactivity from 55fes04
given to rats prior to sacrifice did not parallel carboxylase activity in this
purification.
in 1980 canfield et al (35) de­
veloped procedures to remove inactive proteins from triton-solubilized micro­
somes in order to enhance the activity of the final material. peripheral proteins
were removed from the microsomes with 0.1% octylglycoside in buffer con­
taining phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) as an inhibitor of proteolysis.
the pellet obtained after centrifugation in octyl glycoside was treated with the
chaotropic ion perchlorate and with dtt to liberate inactive membrane pro­
teins. the pellet was then extracted with 0.3% sodium  xxxd1685xxx ; the residue was
suspended in 40 times the original microsomal volume of buffer, and saturated
(nh4hs04 was slowly added over a period of 5 min to give a final concentra­
tion of 33% saturation. the salted-out pellet was collected by centrifugation,
and large volumes of buffer were used to remove the  xxxd1685xxx . the pellet was
resuspended in the original volume containing triton x- l oo , dtt, and 0.5
molar kcl, dialyzed, and assayed. the resulting preparation, called complex
a, was used immediately or stored at -70°c for use. the increase in specific
activity from an initial value of 0.25 units/mg to 37 .6 units/mg was due
principally to the removal of inhibitors of the enzyme with enhancement of total
activity by 40-fold. with loss of other membrane proteins, the specific activity
of the final product was increased iso-fold from the initial microsomes.
the initial vitamin kh2 concentration required for half-maximal activity of
complex a was increased 4-fold, from 20 /-lg/ml to 80 /-lg/ml . the ph optimum
was found to be 6 . 5 , slightly lower than that of solubilized microsomes. the
total carboxylase activity increased 30-fold, whereas the total epoxidase activ­
ity declined to 40%, a reduction in epoxidase:carboxylase ratio of 75-fold.
complex a was devoid of  xxxd3522xxx  reductase and hence required kh2. fifty
percent of the phospholipid originally present in the microsomes was present,
but microscopy showed no membranous material remaining in complex a .
most of the cytochrome p-450 system had been removed.

attempts to further purify complex a by wallin et al (275 , 279) were
unsucces sful . the use of sepharose-desoxycholate and sepharose­
 xxxd2926xxx  affinity chromatography was effective in separating the
protein to two peaks but with a loss of total activity. endogenous carboxylase
activity was present, suggesting that the endogenous substrates (one of high
molecular weight) were tightly bound to the enzyme and were carried through
the purification . the cytochrome p-450 activity of the preparation was dimin­
ished, and the carboxylase activity was enhanced 2-fold. this preparation was
called complex b .
the procedure of vermeer et al (272) for the l q,ooo-fold
purification by gel filtration of a  xxxd3522xxx �ependent carboxylase from bovine
liver microsomes for a decarboxy-prothrombin substrate could not be repeated
by uotila and suttie (269) . the latter investigators found the properties of the
beef enzyme similar to but not identical with the rat liver  xxxd3522xxx �ependent
carboxylase . pentapeptide was active but decarboxyprothrombin was inactive
as a substrate for the bovine carboxylase.
gel filtration

solid phase carboxylase
demetz et al (48) reported the partial purification of bovine liver vitamin
k�ependent carboxylase by immunospecific adsorption onto sepharose­
bound antibodies to factor ii,  xxxg752xxx , and  xxxg741xxx . by analyzing carboxy­
lated precursors from beef microsomes, preincubated with 1 4c02, with factor­
specific sepharose-bound antibodies, these investigators determined that 69%
was  xxxg741xxx  precursor, 21 % prothrombin precursor, and 8%  xxxg752xxx  precur­
sor. the immobilized  xxxg741xxx  carboxylase containing  xxxg741xxx  precursor was
97-fold purified from crude microsomes. when the solid-phase carboxylase
was eluted with 2% sos, in 6 m urea, their most purified preparations still
contained eight proteins on sos-polyacrylamide gels. they reported that 30%
of the enzyme activity could be released into solution from the gel after
incubation with kh2, pentapeptide, nahc03, and  xxxg741xxx . unfortunately, the
liberated enzyme was very unstable and could not be further purified.
in a subsequent paper, oemetz et al (47) reported that sepharose-bound
vitamin-k dependent carboxylase (sp-carboxylase) from bovine liver con­
tained phosphatidylcholine, which is essential for its in vitro activity . the
sp-carboxylase could be depleted of phospholipids either by washing the
enzyme with detergents or by treatment with phospholipase c. the enzyme
could be reconstituted by adding mixed micelles of phosphatidylcholine and
 xxxd1685xxx  ( 1 : 1 ) to the solid-phase enzyme. these investigators found the deter­
gents triton x-ioo,  xxxd1685xxx , and  xxxd1835xxx  , which are commonly used for
the extraction of carboxylase from microsomal membranes, strongly inhibitory
to sp-carboxylase. this inhibition could be prevented by adding a crude extract

of microsomal phospholipids as a sepharose-bound enzyme. demetz et al (45)
further reported that acetone and  xxxd1896xxx  would stimulate carboxy­
lation of peptapeptide and epoxidation of kh2 by their sp-carboxylase up
to 5-fold. they speculated that these solvents might enhance the mobility of
kh2 in the lipid micelle and increase its availability as a substrate to the car­
boxylase.
olson and colleagues ( 168 , 1 86) also prepared a solid-phase rat liver car­
boxylase using sepharose-bound antibodies to rat plasma prothrombin. vir­
tually all of the prothrombin precursor protein was bound by the antibody gel.
the percentage of carboxylase enzyme activity bound by the antibody gel from
four different preparations ranged from 40% to 69% , with a mean value of
50% . it seems possible from these results that the enzyme(s) are present in
excess of the prothrombin precursor protein. it is known that about 50% of the
carboxylase activity in solubilized rat liver microsomes precipitates with anti­
 xxxg741xxx  antibodies (285). whether the enzyme that carboxylates  xxxg741xxx 
precursor is the same as the one that carboxylates preprothrombin is not known.
as suggested earlier, the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylases may be a family of
isozymes.
with 5 rom ddt present, the carboxylase activity of the anti-prothrombin
solid-phase enzyme toward exogenous pentapeptide was linear over a 2-hr
period. this contrasts with the findings of demetz et al (47), who reported a
30-min lag in developing pentapeptide carboxylase activity with the beef
enzyme precipitated with antibodies to  xxxg741xxx . the optimum temperature for
peptide carboxylation for both the solid phase and soluble enzyme appeared to
be around 1 8°c.
phosphatidylcholine (0.2 mg) stimulated carboxylase activity approximately
25% . it also proved to be a stabilizing factor. mnch (10 rom) stimulated
carboxylase activity 2-fold. dithiothreitol (ddt) enhanced activity another
2-fold by maintaining the vitamin kh2 in a reduced form for a longer period.
rat  xxxg124xxx  (0.2 mg) stimulated activity , probably as a result of its free
fatty acid binding properties. with all ligands present, the specific activity of
the solid-phase enzyme was 240 times that of the soluble preparation.
one surprise was the total lack of stimulation of pentapeptide carboxylation
by the solid-phase enzyme by 1 rom pyridoxal-5 ' -phosphate. peptide carboxy­
lation by the triton-solubilized enzyme is stimulated 2-3-fold by pyridoxal-5 ' ­
phosphate ( 1 1 2 , 255) . it is likely that the plp receptor site is blocked by
antibodies in the solid-phase enzyme despite the availability of peptide to the
active site.
cuc 1 2 (2 rom) , a blocker of -sh groups, inhibited the activity of the
solid-phase enzyme. this inhibition was completely reversed with 5 rom ddt.
this solid-phase enzyme exhibited a mixed "cytochrome type" difference
spectrum in the presence of dithionite, showing a minimum at 410 nm and a

maximum at 426 nm . 59fes04 given to rats prior to sacrifice was found in the
solid-phase system at an increased specific activity (186) .
prothrombin precursor carboxylated by the solid state comigrated with
prothrombin at an apparent molecular weight of 75 ,000. no other antibody­
precipitated carboxylated protein was present except for a minor protein with
an apparent molecular weight of 55,000. this carboxylation of the endogenous
precursor occurred rapidly over a period of 1-2 min and then ceased. the
enzyme-substrate complex was thus functional in the antibody-precipitated
solid-phase state, as was also observed by swanson & suttie (259).

kinetic studies
one question that has intrigued
investigators in this field is whether or not the liver microsomal vitamin
k-dependent carboxylase that fixes co2 into synthetic glu-containing pep­
tides is the same enzyme that carboxylates the endogenous microsomal
prothrombin precursor protein. as noted, peptide carboxylation in solubilized
hepatic microsomes is stimulated 2-3-fold by mn2 + and other divalent cations
and by pyridoxal-5 t -phosphate, and is inhibited 90% by chloro-k (1 /ig/ml) ,
99% by warfarin (10 mm), and 93% by  xxxd2843xxx  (0. 5 mm).
in contrast, the carboxylation of the endogenous protein is not stimulated or
markedly inhibited by these ligands ( i 1 2, 123 , 255).
kappel & olson (122) undertook to study the mechanism of divalent cation
activation of the solubilized rat liver  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase from
warfarinized rats . they also undertook a study of the effect of pentapeptide
substrate on the initial velocity of endogenous microsomal protein carboxyla­
tion as well as the effect of the presence of endogenous protein substrate on the
initial velocity of the pentapeptide carboxylation . the carboxylation rate of the
pentapeptide substrate was stimulated 2-3-fold by l o mm mn2+ , mg2+ , ca2 + ,
and sr2 + . the cation activation of the pentapeptide carboxylation is nonaddi­
tive and is probably a general action of divalent cations . these same cations
exhibited a reproducible but much smaller activation (11-18%) of the endoge­
nous protein carboxylation rate. the anions cl- , f- , br- , and h 2poi had no
effect.
the mechanism responsible for the cation stimulation of the pentapeptide
carboxylation was investigated in more detail. the data demonstrated that
manganese chloride does not effect the vmax of the reaction but effectively
lowers the apparent km of pentapeptide 3-fold, from 6.2 mm to 1 . 7 mm .
 xxxd2532xxx  exhibited identical effects on km and vmax '
the slight activation of the endogenous protein carboxylation rate by cations
could be the result of the much lower km value for the natural endogenous
substrate. soute et al (238) have shown that the apparent km for added
peptide vs protein carboxylation

decarboxylated plasma prothrombin and the decarboxylated nhz-terminal
residues 1 3-29 are l o-fold and 1000-fold lower, respectively, than the km for
the pentapeptide. the concentration of precursor prothrombin in microsomes
varies from 0.2 to 1 .0 j.lm , so one would expect the km to be in the micromolar
range for the endogenous substrate.
kappel & olson ( 1 22) found that the carboxylation of endogenous precursor
was rapid at 20°c and was totally dependent on vitamin khz. the reaction
exhibited a linear rate for only about 45 sec and was essentially complete within
5 min. the effect of pentapeptide substrate on the initial velocity of the
endogenous protein carboxylation was investigated using 3 mm pentapeptide
in the presence of 5 mm dte, 10 mm manganese chloride at 20°c. a small but
significant decrease in the initial rate of endogenous protein carboxylation of
about 14% in the presence of 3 mm pentapeptide was observed. the final
incorporation of 14c02 into the protein was equivalent in the presence and
absence of peptide after 3 min . when peptide carboxylation was observed in
the presence of uncarboxylated precursor, there was a 45-sec delay before the
pentapeptide carboxylation became linear, indicating a competition with the
endogenous protein for the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase. if the endoge­
nous precursor was carboxylated prior to the addition of peptide, then no lag in
the carboxylation of peptide was observed. these data plus identical thermal
denaturation rates for the enzymes catalyzing protein and peptide carboxylation
suggest strongly that a single carboxylase is responsible for the carboxylation
of both endogenous precursor and added peptide. the initial carboxylation rate
for endogenous protein is about 50 pmoles/minlmg protein, which is six times
the peptide carboxylation rate in the presence of mnc l z.
shah & suttie (227) approached this problem in a slightly different way by
studying the comparative carboxylation activity for protein and peptide of
partially solubilized (0.25% triton x- l oo) and completely solubilized ( 1 .0%
triton x- l oo) microsomes. the rate of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylation of
endogenous protein precursors was rapid in the completely solubilized liver
microsomal preparation and was accompanied by the simultaneous carboxyla­
tion of the exogenous peptide phe-leu-glu-glu-leu . in the partially solubil­
ized liver microsomal preparation, however, the rate of protein carboxylation
was reduced, and a lag in the carboxylation of exogenous substrate was
observed. when the microsomes from  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats were depleted
of endogenous precursor by prior  xxxd3522xxx  injections, the lag in peptide
carboxylation was eliminated. they also concluded that both substrates utilized
the same microsomal pool of carboxylase.
the role of pyridoxal-5 ' -phosphate

it was first shown by suttie et al
(255) that pyridoxal-5 ' -phosphate (plp) stimulated the carboxylation of pen-

tapeptide about 2-fold but had little, if any, effect on the carboxylation of the
endogenous protein precursor. dubin et al (53) showed that this effect was due
not to schiff-base formation between the peptide and the plp but to the binding
of the plp to the microsomal carboxylase. suttie et al (25 1 ) observed that the
carboxylation of amino protected peptides that could not form schiff-base with
plp are still stimulated with plp.
rikong-adie et al (21 2) reported that the plp adduct of phe-leu-glu-glu­
val reduced with nab� was a good substrate for the carboxylase but was not
further stimulated by exogenous plp. they concluded that the plp effect was
due to derivatization of peptide and not the enzyme.
kappel & olson ( 1 22) found that increasing concentrations of plp enhanced
the initial rate of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent pentapeptide carboxylation 2-3-fold in
the concentration range between 0.5 and 1 .0 mm whereas plp concentrations
of 2.0 mm or higher were less stimulatory. they observed that the km for
pentapeptide was 7 . 1 mm in the absence of plp and 2.4 mm in the presence of
plp. there was no effect on the vmax of the reaction.
the activation by plp was found to be specific since pyridoxal, pyridoxine,
pyridoxine-5 1 -p, pyridoxamine, pyridoxamine-5 1 -p, and 4-pyridoxic acid did
not stimulate the rate of pentapeptide carboxylation. in fact, all six analogs
inhibited the carboxylation reaction in either the presence or absence of added
plp. the activation of the carboxylase by plp appears to be mediated by its
direct binding to the enzyme via schiff-base formation. sodium borohydride
reduction of solubilized microsomes in the presence of plp, fol lowed by
dialysis to remove unbound material, resulted in a carboxylase preparation with
a specific activity twice that of the untreated control microsomes when both
were assayed in the absence of added plp. the derivatized enzyme was not
further stimulated by added plp. the plp-derivatized pentapeptide exhibited
1 50% of the carboxylase activity of the control pentapeptide, in agreement with
rikong-adie (21 2) ; but in the presence of this substrate, exogenous plp
actually inhibited carboxylation.
it was concluded that plp forms a covalent attachment to a lysine near the
active center of the enzyme, which is stabilized by nab� reduction. since the
plp-derivatized peptide is an active substrate that prevents further activation
by external plp, the peptide must bind in close proximity to the critical lysine,
and this site is blocked from external plp when the bulky plp-derivatized
peptide is the substrate.

martius ( 156) predicted that  xxxd3522xxx  would be found to be a member of a
specialized electron transport chain in animals beginning with nadh and
terminating with 02. his prediction, though made for mitochondria, has been
confirmed for a microsomal system.  xxxd3522xxx  reduction may be initiated by

an nad(p)h-dependent flavoprotein reductase (278) that converts  xxxd3522xxx 
to the hydroquinone (kh2) or by a dithiol-dependent reductase in rat liver
microsomes (283) that accomplishes the same reaction.
the autooxidation of kh2 results in the formation of k and h202 ( 1 70) .
quinone-mediated electron transport in mitochondria produces small amounts
of h202 in proportion to the content of reduced ubiquinone (27) . the llgo for
the oxidation kh2 + o2 - k + h202 is about 35 kcal per mol, more than
enough energy to accomplish the carboxylation of peptide-bound glutamate.
the llgo for the oxidation of  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone to  xxxd3522xxx -2,3epoxide, namely kh2 + o2 - ko + h 20, is somewhat less but nonetheless
sufficient to provide adequate energy for the carboxylation reaction. the main
energy-requiring step is the removal of a proton or hydrogen from the 'y­
methylene carbon of peptide-bound glutamate. since the system is membrane
bound and does not require atp, energy conservation is accomplished in some
unknown way. uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and two calcium
ionophores (a-23 1 87 and x-537a) do not inhibit the reaction ( 1 93). the
system, furthermore, functions in the presence of detergent concentrations that
would presumably destroy the membrane integrity needed to maintain an ion
gradient.
the chemical possibilities to be considered as mechanisms for vitamin
k-dependent 'y-glutamyl carboxylation include (a) the activation of oxygen,
(b) the activation of co2, and (c) the activation of  xxxd2431xxx .
as regards the activation of oxygen, the oxidation of hydroquinones results
in the generation of superoxide anion (oio) and h202. the evidence does not
favor these reduced forms of oxygen as driving forces for the carboxylation
reaction since superoxide dismutase and catalase do not inhibit the carboxyla­
tion significantly (63, 1 29).
as regards co2, jones et al ( 1 2 1 ) investigated the active species of "c02" in
the microsomal system by the low-temperature method of filmer & cooper
(75) . this was possible only because menaquinone-2 is quite active  xxxd1891xxx °c in
the microsomal system. the reactions were carried out with washed micro­
somes in the presence of cycloheximide, avidin, and acetazolamide to inhibit,
respectively, protein synthesis, biotin-dependent reactions, and carbonic
anhydrase. 1 4c02 or h 1 4co; were generated preferentially, and the rate of
uptake of isotope from each species into gla residues in microsomal protein
was measured at minute intervals for 5 minutes. the incorporation of radioac­
tivity from 14c02 after 1 min was 5-10 times that from h 1 4co; . the presence
of 1 mm atp or the inhibitor adp-nh-p had no effect on the rate of uptake of
either species. when the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor was omitted, a linear
14c02 uptake curve, intermediate between those obtained in its presence, was
obtained. the apparent km for -hc03 in these experiments was 0.4 mm
which suggests that the km for co2 is the order of 2 x 10- 5 m. the hydro,

phobic nature of the endoplasmic reticulum protects co2 against hydration and
permits this tight binding of co2 to the  xxxd3522xxx -{fependent carboxylase.
no role for  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone as a co2 carrier via hemicarbonates [a
role analogous to that proposed by todd and his colleagues (264) for reduced
napthoquinone hemiphosphates as intermediates in oxidative phosphorylation]
was evident. the hemicarbonate ethylester of menaquinone-2 labeled with 1 4c
in the carbonate moiety proved inactive in the carboxylation assay ( 193).
the activation of co2 by a radical exchange reaction involving the formation
of the semiquinone plus ·c02 , namely

as suggested by gallop et al (86) , has not yet been substantiated. peroxy
radicals of  xxxd3522xxx  have been produced by pulse radiolysis (209) , but a
radical-radical c-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the  xxxd3522xxx -{fependent
carboxylase has not been demonstrated.
the activation of the 'y-methylene group of glutamyl residues to a 'y­
methylene carbanion or a 'y-methylene radical is thus the only remaining
possibility, and this mechanism has been intensively explored. friedman et al
(8 1 ) demonstrated with an acetone powder of microsomes from  xxxd3522xxx ­
deficient rats that the release of tritium from the 'y-position of  xxxd2431xxx  in
the peptide phe-leu-glu*-glu*-leu (labeled in the 'y and \3 protons of glutamic
acid with 3h) is dependent upon the concentration of vitamin kh2 and o2 but
not co2, the ratio of tritium released to co2 fixed in these experiments varied
from 2 1 .6 at 0.2 mm hcoi , to 1 .9 at 4 mm h coi , as shown in figure 3 .

tritium release exceeded co2 uptake by a factor of two at the point of
maximum coupling. in a subsequent paper these authors ( 1 27) showed that
tritium release from glu-iabeled pentapeptide paralleled net  xxxd3522xxx -2,3epoxide (ko) formation in triton x- ioo solubilized rat liver microsomes.
under these conditions, however, the ko:c02 ratios varied from 16 to 27 . in
this study the ratio of ko:c02 formed varied with the -hc03 concentration
from 1 0: 1 at o . 5 mm to 1 : 1 at 6 mm (figure 3). these workers concluded that
carboxylation of glu-peptide and epoxidation are coupled i : i under physiolog­
ical conditions. in other studies, the epoxidase:carboxylase ratio has varied
from 0 . 8 to 5.0 in different preparations at the point of maximum coupling (46,
2 1 6).
attempts to introduce tritium from 3 h20 have thus far failed (78) . it has been
noted by cram et al (40) that intramolecular proton transfers within diphenyl­
benzyl derivatives can occur without exchange of protons with relative nonpo­
lar solvents . in order to determine whether the active form of peptide-bound
glutamate is a carbonium on a carbon radical , friedman et al (78) synthesized
boc-['v-3h] glu-glu-leu-ome with fluorine in the l3-position of the glu
residues, expecting fluoride to be eliminated if a carbanion were formed . these
fluorinated tripeptides , however, were not carboxylated when incubated with
solubilized microsomes and 14c02 , nor was fluoride eliminated. other
approaches are needed to determine the precise species of "active" glutamate.
dubois et al (54) synthesized two fluoro-pentapeptides of general structure
phe-leu-x-glu-val, where x is either the l-threo-'v-fluoroglutamic acid or the
l- xxxd2033xxx -isomer, to determine the stereochemical course of the  xxxd3522xxx ­
dependent carboxylation. both peptides were carboxylate� , but the reaction
occurred exclusively on the  xxxd2431xxx  of the l-threo-'v-fluoro­
glutamate-containing peptide, whereas both glutamic and fluoroglutamic res­
idues of the l- xxxd2033xxx -'v-fluoroglutamate-containing peptide were carboxy­
lated. a study of hydrolysis products of these carboxylated fluoropeptides
revealed that no carboxylation of the l-threo-isomer of glutamate occurred , but
excellent carboxylation of the l- xxxd2033xxx -isomer was observed . it was also
shown that glutamic residue 4 in the pentapaptide can be carboxylated if a
nonreactive residue occurs in position 3 . in nonfluorinated pentapeptide , the
preferential site of carboxylation in vitro is residue 3 (76, 2 1 2).
these results reveal that the enzymatic 'v-hydrogen abstraction step is stereo­
specific and corresponds to the elimination of the pro-s hydrogen of glutamic
acid. the precise reaction mechanism by which hydrogen is removed from the
pro-s position on the 'v-methylene carbon of peptide-bound glutamate by
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase remains unsettled.
one hypothesis proposed for the removal of the 'v-hydrogen from glutamate
is via an intermediate in the oxidation of  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone (kh2) to
 xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide (ko). willingham & matschiner (286) were the first to

cursor in liver microsomes from rats with  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency or warfarin
treatment. in their experiments the administration of  xxxd3522xxx  to these anti­
coagulated rats stimulated prothrombin appearance in the plasma and caused a
fall in  xxxd3522xxx  epoxidase activity. they postulated that "the enzymic inter­
conversion of phylloquinone and its 2,3 epoxide is involved in the vitamin
k-dependent production of prothrombin."
later, sadowski, schnoes & suttie (2 1 8) correlated carboxylation activity
with epoxidase activity in rat liver microsomes under a variety of conditions,
whereas wallin et al (276) could dissociate the two activities completely by
chromatographic fractionation of detergent-solubilized rat liver microsomes.
nonetheless, any hypothesis for the role of  xxxd3522xxx  in the carboxylation
reaction must consider the relationship between these two activities. both
reactions are located in the same tissues (83), and both activities are enriched in
the rer (37 , 56) . both enzymatic activities utilize the reduced vitamin as a
substrate (220), are inhibited by chloro-k ( 14), and are active with the same
forms of the vitamin (82) . it has been demonstrated, furthermore, that increas­
ing the concentration of a peptide substrate for the carboxylase , which in­
creases the number of carboxylation events, also increases epoxidase activity
(252) .
although the ko:c02 ratio appears to be 1 .0 under some conditions, the
carboxylation and epoxidation rates can be uncoupled under a variety of
conditions. the addition of 1 0 mm cn- inhibits carboxylation 50-70% and
increases epoxidation 1 50-200% above normal (46, 1 27 , 1 3 1 ) . larson et al
( 1 27) noted under their conditions of kcn inhibition of carboxylation that 3h
release was inhibited 30% despite a doubling of the rate of epoxidation .
manganese ions at 1 0 mm stirnulated carboxylation, epoxidation, and 3 h
release ( 1 28). various methods of extracting microsomes can also change the
ratio of carboxylation and epoxidation (35).
these data lead to the general working hypothesis for the action of the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase depicted in figure 4. the reaction is pre­
sented as an ordered mechanism. basically, three coupling sites are proposed.
the first is the combination of the enzyme with kh2 and o2 to yield a ternary
enzyme-substrate couplex and possibly a vitamin khr(02) compound. this
step is inhibited competitively by cl-phylloquinone and tetra-chloropyridinol
(284). a ternary complex of kh2 and o2 with a metalloprotein has also been
proposed ( 1 86) . some leakage will occur at this point to produce  xxxd3522xxx  and
h202 as indicated.
the 2-hydroperoxide of  xxxd3522xxx  has been suggested as the active in­
termediate (44 , 1 29). t-butyl-hydroperoxide, proposed as a model for the
 xxxd3522xxx  hydroperoxide by larson & suttie ( 1 29), is not an agonist of vitamin
k in solubilized microsomes (99) nor is it a competitive inhibitor of the vitamin
k-dependent carboxylase (98). the nad(p)h-dependent carboxylated pro­
duct with t-butyl-ooh is not gla but an unidentified acid (99, 280).

absence of peptide, and this blank is subtracted in computing ko:c02 ratios.
peptide addition, however, usually enhances both carboxylation and epoxida­
tion . cn- , however, uncouples both 3h release and carboxylation from epox­
2
idation, whereas mn + ions appear to stimulate all three events . x is put in
series with kh2 - [02] and ko because the intermediate steps are not known
with certainty. larson & suttie ( 1 29) proposed that a hypothetical vitamin
k-hydroperoxy anion might be sufficiently basic to remove the 'v-methylene
proton from peptide-bound glutamate . olson et al ( 1 86) argued the contrary
and suggested an induction mechanism for the labilization of the "v-methylene
proton. they also reported (98) that in their hands pure glutathione peroxidase
did not inhibit  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylation.
demetz et al (44) have suggested that heterolytic fission of the hypothetical
hydroperoxide group could generate a hydroxyl ion basic enough to remove a

'y-proton from peptide-bound glutamate. they also claimed that hs03 ions
caused reduction of the hypothetical kh-ooh to hydroxyvitamin k and water,
a claim that has not been confirmed ( 1 69).
further work is needed on purer preparations of the carboxylase to advance
understanding of this complicated mechanism.

absorption and metabolism of  xxxd3522xxx 

absorption
the absorption of phylloquinone and the menaquinones requires bile and
pancreatic juice for maximum effectiveness ( 1 50) . dietary  xxxd3522xxx  is
absorbed in the small bowel , is incorporated into chylomicrons , and appears in
the lymph (25). the efficiency of absorption has been measured at 40--80%,
depending upon the vehicle in which the vitamin is administered and the extent
of the enterohepatic circulation . when isotopically labeled phylloquinone was
administered orally to animals (287) and humans (232) in doses ranging from
the physiological to the pharmacological , the vitamin appeared in the plasma
within 20 min and reached a peak in the plasma in two hours. when i mg of
phylloquinie was given intravenously, peak plasma levels of about 100 ng/ml
were observed. the concentration of the vitamin then declined exponentially to
low values over a period of 48-72 hr to reach postabsorptive values of 1-5
ng/ml (38, 1 32 , 23 1 , 234). during this period, it appeared to be transferred
from the chylomicron remnants to the liver, where it is incorporated into very
low density lipoproteins (vldl) and ultimately distributed to tissues via low
density lipoproteins (ldl). this transfer system also applies to dietary sterols
and carotenoids. thus far a specific plasma carrier protein for  xxxd3522xxx  has not
been identified .

intermediary metabolism
the liver appears to be the primary target of administered  xxxd3522xxx  in animals
and humans. as much as 50% of a parenterally administered dose of  xxxd3522xxx  i
may appear in the liver of rats within 1 hr ( 1 1 ) . after oral administration , the
liver may contain as much as 20% of the administered dose in 2 hr, which then
declines to low values after 24 hr. the principal sites of uptake, after liver, were
skin and muscle . fractionation of liver tissue, after the administration of
3h-phylloquinone to rats , showed the following relative distribution of radioac­
tivity: nuclei, 1 3 % , mitochondria, 9%, microsomes, 63%, and cytosol , 14%
( 1 1 ) . in omnivorous animals like humans, both phylloquinone and the higher
molecular weight menaquinones (mk-7 to mk- 1 3) of bacterial origin are
found in the liver ( 1 58 , 2 1 1 ) . haroon & hauschka (100) have found phyllo­
quinone levels in rat liver to vary between 8 and 44 ng/g fresh weight (20-- 1 00
pmoles/g). taggart & matschiner (260) estimated that 10 pmoles/g (4. 5 ng/g)
of  xxxd3522xxx  is the minimum hepatic concentration to sustain normal prothrom­
bin levels in the rat.

the turnover of  xxxd3522xxx  in the animal body is rapid, and the total
body-pool size is surprisingly small. bjornsson et al ( 1 7) infused 300 �g of
3
h-phylloquinone into human volunteers with or without previous drug loading
with warfarin or  xxxd1724xxx  . the initial half-time (tt ) for the first exponential
a
phase was 26 ± 8 min and the average terminal half-time was 1 66 ± 9 min
under all conditions . shearer et al (233) found similar results with a 1 mg
3
intravenous dose of h-phylloquinone, namely t t ;::; 20-24 min and t t ;::;
�
a
1 20-1 50 min. from data on the volume of distribution and clearance rate ,
bjornsson et al ( 1 8) calculated the fractional turnover rate to be o.4/hr,
suggesting that the body pool was turning once every 2.5 hr. from approximate
daily intakes of  xxxd3522xxx , body-pool sizes were estimated to be 50-1 00 �g,
which is less than the body-pool size from  xxxd2716xxx  \ 2 and extraordinarily low
for a fat-soluble vitamin.

 xxxd3522xxx - xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide cycle
in 1 970, matschiner et al ( 1 60) reported the isolation and characterization of
phylloquinone 2,3-epoxide as a new metabolite of phylloquinone in the rat.
although small amounts of this metabolite were found in normal rats , a marked
accumulation of the epoxide was demonstrated in the presence of warfarin .
approximately 30 years earlier, fieser and his colleagues (74) synthesized the
2,3-epoxide of phylloquinone and showed that it was rapidly converted to
 xxxd3522xxx  in normal animals. bell & matschiner ( 10) then reported that
phylloquinone epoxide had the same biological activity as phylloquinone in the
 xxxd3522xxx -deficient rat but was much less active in the warfarin-anticoagulated
rat. they suggested that warfarin inhibited the reductase required for the
normal conversion of phylloquinone oxide to phylloquinone . bell & matschin­
er (9) then suggested that  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide was not only a metabolite of
 xxxd3522xxx  but in fact a competitive inhibitor of the vitamin at its active site on
the c arboxylase . they ( 1 3 ) administered 3 h-phylloquinone and 3 h_
phylloquinone epoxide to normal and warfarin-treated rats .  xxxd3522xxx ) ­
epoxide: xxxd3522xxx ) ratios were found to be elevated in animals receiving
warfarin as opposed to controls, but the hepatic  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide: xxxd3522xxx 
ratios obtained in rats pretreated with warfarin receiving various doses of
 xxxd3522xxx  from 5 to 100 �g varied over too small a range (0.9- 1 .9) to account
for the changes in prothrombin response (0-60%) . further, bell & caldwell (8)
showed that in warfarin-resistant rats where  xxxd3522xxx ) epoxide appeared to
accumulate in the absence of warfarin, "inhibitory ratios" of  xxxd3522xxx  epox­
ide: xxxd3522xxx  ) were obtained at 1 00% plasma prothrombin levels.
neither goodman et al (93) nor sadowski & suttie (2 19) could confirm the
conclusion that  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide was an inhibitor of the vitamin. good­
man et al (93) infused l . 6 mg of  xxxd3522xxx ) oxide (k ) o) per hour for 4 hr
intravenously into warfarin-resistant rats and demonstrated that the ko:k ratio
in the liver reached high values (7 .2 ± 1 .6 sem) without any effect upon

plasma prothrombin levels ( 1 00 ± 10%). in a companion experiment in which
warfarin was given in doses of 1 mglkg simultaneously with physiological
amounts of  xxxd3522xxx  (50 ng/hr intravenously) , warfarin had its usual effect
upon prothrombin level when the ratio of  xxxd3522xxx \ oxide: xxxd3522xxx \ was in
the physiological range of 0. 1 3 ± 0.03. sadowski & suttie (2 1 9) conducted
similar studies, which demonstrated that the conversion of microsomal precur­
sors of prothrombin to the active zymogen was not blocked by a high level of
administered  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide. bell and colleagues (7) finally retracted this
hypothesis.
warfarin-resistance is observed in both animals and humans ( 1 82). mutant
strains of wild rats having a greatly increased resistance to warfarin and other
4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulants were discovered in wales (97). when these
rats were crossbred to the warfarin-susceptible sprague-dawley (sd) rat,
selecting for the trait of resistance (which is carried on an autosomal dominant
gene), the resultant offspring required 50-200 times more warfarin to anti­
coagulate and 20 times more  xxxd3522xxx  to maintain hemostasis. despite this, no
marked changes in the overall metabolism of warfarin or  xxxd3522xxx  from that of
the sensitive sprague-dawley rat could be demonstrated in early studies ( 1 03 ,
1 9 8 , 265 ) . shah & suttie (229) found that the 2-chloro-3-phytyl- l ,4naphthoquinone was as effective, if not more effective , in suppressing
prothrombin synthesis in warfarin-resistant rats than in normal rats. zimmer­
man & matschiner (289) reported that the k-epoxide reductase of warfarin­
resistant rats was 30 times more resistant to inhibition by warfarin in vitro than
the reductase present in sprague -dawley control animals. they concluded that
this defect was the molecular basis of the warfarin resistance .
the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle is shown in figure 5 . in essence it is a salvage pathway
for  xxxd3522xxx , a vitamin present in only nanomolar quantities in liver and other
tissues. it postulates that the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxidase (which may be linked to, or
identical with, the carboxylase) converts  xxxd3522xxx  to its 2,3-epoxide usually in
excess of the carboxylation rate. the epoxide i s then reduced to the quinone by
an epoxide reductase . the regenerated  xxxd3522xxx  is now reduced to the vitamin
k hydroquinone by several possible enzymes, at least one driven by a dithiol
and several by nad(p)h. the dithiol-dependent epoxide reductase and
quinone reductase are strongly inhibited by warfarin, whereas the nad(p)h
dependent dehydrogenases are relatively insensitive (278).

activity was inhibited most effectively by direct antagonists of  xxxd3522xxx 
action, such as tetrachloro-4-pyridinol.
a subsequent study by sadowski et al (2 1 8) demonstrated that the heat-stable
factor could be replaced by nadh and that, at least under these circumstances,
no soluble cytoplasmic protein was required. the nadh requirement was
abolished if the reduced form of  xxxd3522xxx  was used as the substrate, and it was
shown that the hydroquinone form of the vitamin was the species that was
converted to the epoxide. with isotopically. labeled oxygen, it was demons­
trated that o2 is the source of the epoxide oxygen. the overall reaction appears
to be an atypical mixed-function oxidase with the required reducing equivalents
coming from the  xxxd2299xxx  form of the vitamin. although the epoxidase activity
can be induced by phenobarbital treatment, the lack of sensitivity to co ( 1 25)
and the lack of effect of commonly used inhibitors of cytochrome p-4s0 (2 1 8)
suggest that it is not a p-450 enzyme. the most intriguing aspect of microsomal
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxidase activity is the possibility, discussed above, that it is part of
the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent 'y-glutamyl carboxylase.
preusch & suttie (200) have shown that the epoxidase reaction generates a
stereospecific (+ )phylloquinone-2,3-epoxide, which has been assigned the
2s,3r configuration shown in figure 6.

 xxxd3522xxx -2 ,3-epoxide reductase
addition to epoxidase activity, liver microsomes contain an epoxide reduc­
tase activity that can convert the  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide back to the vitamin
( 1 63 , 289). this enzyme is inhibited by warfarin. it has been postulated that the
cyclic interconversion of the vitamin to its epoxide and back is required for its
action and that warfarin exerts its effect on prothrombin synthesis through its
action on this enzyme.
warfarin-resistant strains of rats were first identified in northern europe (29,
142), and the epoxide reductase activity in these rats has been shown to be
much less sensitive to warfarin than that of normal rats (289). more hydropho­
bic 4-hydroxy coumarin drugs like difenacoum inhibit the epoxide reductase in
warfarin-resistant rats equally well ( 1 05).
some of the properties of this enzyme have been described by whitlon et al
(283) . the enzyme has little activity in the presence of nad(p)h but is active
when dithiothreitol is used as a reducing agent. the physiologically active
reducing agent is not known.  xxxd2494xxx  at the same concentration was 53% as
activity as dtt and, as is the case with dtt, the  xxxd2494xxx -driven reductase was
warfarin sensitive. the  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxidediol is not an intermediate in the
reaction (5). more recently, siegfried (235) has reported success in solubilizing
in

the reductase i n potassium  xxxd1685xxx . the properties of the solubilized enzyme
appear to be similar to those observed for the microsomal-bound enzyme. a
protein factor present in the cytosol was observed to enhance the microsomal
epoxide-reductase activity (235).
preusch & suttie (200) studied the stereoselectivity of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide
reductase for the oxirane ring configuration by recovering the partially re­
solved, unreacted substrate following incubations of racemic  xxxd3522xxx  epox­
ide with rat liver microsomes . after incubation, this substrate was enriched for
the ( - )-enantiomer, but selectivity for the biologically relevant ( + )­
enantiomer was low. this result was confirmed by direct comparison of the
rates of reaction of the racemic substrate compared to the naturally occurring
( + )vitarnin k epoxide. the selectivity of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase for the
cis- or trans-phytyl configuration of the  xxxd3522xxx  side chain was also low.
these results suggest an enzyme active site that is open toward the 2,3 positions
and is able to bind the substrate in two opposite orientations with respect to the
positions of the methyl and phytyl side-chain substituents, as shown in figure
6.
silverman (236) suggested a mechanism for  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase
based on a chemical model that depicted a simultaneous acid-base catalysis
involving protonation of the oxygen in the oxirane ring and an attack on
carbon-2 of the epoxide by a sulfhydryl group to give a thioether of  xxxd3522xxx 
with opening of the oxirane ring. an adjacent sulfhydryl in the enzyme was
visualized as attacking the sulfur binding the 2-position with formation of a
keto-enol tautomer at position 1 that stabilizes the substrate and permits the
elimination of water and the reconstitution of  xxxd3522xxx -quinone . this model
(see figure 7) has been restudied by preusch & suttie (20 1 ) , who proposed the
enol as the sole intermediate in the reductive step prior to the elimination of
water.
fasco et al (68) have identified 3-hydroxyvitamin k [(3)-hydroxy-2 ,3dihydro-2-methyl ,3-phytyl- l ,4�naphthoquinone] as a product of  xxxd3522xxx 
epoxide reduction in hepatic microsomes from warfarin-resistant rats , but not
in those obtained from normal rats and not in detergent-solubilized microsomes
from either strain of rat. the structure of 3-hydroxyvitamin k (3-khoh) was
determined by comparison of the hplc behavior, uv , ir, cd, and mass
spectra of the unknown with chemically synthesized standards. alterations in
the formation of hydroxyvitamin k occurred in parallel with alterations in total
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reduction in warfarin-resistant rats with respect to reaction
time, extent of reaction, effect of detergents, and inhibition by warfarin. thus ,
3-khoh appears to be a product of the warfarin-resistant  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide
reductase. it is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the epoxide reductase.
khoh is formed from both enantiomers of  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide, but
( + ) xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide yields (+ )3-khoh. in microsomes of warfarin­
resistant rats the enolate (vi), shown in figure 7, may be more loosely bound.

mechanism of action of  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide reductase. it is proposed that the vitamin

k-epoxide (ko)(i) is attacked at position 2 by an -sh group of the enzyme to form a thioether
adduct with opening of the oxirane ring (ii). attack by an adjacent -sh to form a disulfide enzyme
forms an enolate of 3-hydroxy k. the enolate is then visualized as rearranging to form either the
quinone (iv) and water (pathway a) or 3-hydroxy  xxxd3522xxx  (pathway b). a less tight binding of the
enolate to the enzyme would favor pathway h. after (68).

this could pennit dissociation and chemical rearrangement to the  xxxd3522xxx 
hydroxide.

washed liver microsomes revealed that a cytoplasmic factor plus nad(p)h was

factor was a  xxxd3522xxx  reductase. chemically prepared  xxxd3522xxx  hydro­
quinone can substitute for  xxxd3522xxx  plus nad(p)h and a reductase .
since vitamin kh2 is rapidly oxidized by air to  xxxd3522xxx  in foods, the
dietary intake of the vitamin is solely as the quinone, which appears to circulate
in the blood as the quinone at levels of 1-5 ng/m! . one of the current questions
about the metabolism of  xxxd3522xxx  and the action of the 4-hydroxycoumarin
drugs is the identity of the reductase(s) that carry out the reduction of  xxxd3522xxx 
in the endoplasmic reticulum.
there are several enzymes in tissues that can reduce  xxxd3522xxx  to its
hydroquinone. marki & martius ( 1 53) described an nadh- xxxd3522xxx  reduc­
tase from beef liver, which was found principally in the cytoplasm and to a
lesser extent in mitochondria. at about the same time, ernster et al (57 , 58)
described a flavoprotein enzyme from rat liver, which they named dt­
 xxxg641xxx  (e.c. 1 . 6. 99.2) because it catalyzed the oxidation of both nadh
and nad(p)h with various organic dyes and quinones , including  xxxd3522xxx .
the enzyme was found principally in the cytoplasm, was strongly inhibited by
 xxxd1875xxx , and was activated by  xxxg124xxx . the sensitivity to  xxxd1875xxx 
raised the question whether the reduction of  xxxd3522xxx  was the 4-hydroxy­
coumarin-sensitive step in anticoagulation.
wallin et al (277) purified dt- xxxg641xxx  from rat liver by affinity chroma­
tography and showed that this enzyme was also present in solubilized micro­
somes. they removed the enzyme from solubilized microsomes by affinity
chromatography and showed that all carboxylation activity due to  xxxd3522xxx 
was lost. the carboxylase activity of this inactive preparation could be com­
pletely restored by the addition of the purified dt- xxxg641xxx  plus nad(p)h.
in this experiment dithiothreitol (dtt) could not replace the dt- xxxg641xxx  . it
was concluded that dt- xxxg641xxx  , though principally cytosolic, is also pres­
ent in microsomes and is the physiologically relevant  xxxd3522xxx -reductase .
more recently, wallin & hutson (278) raised antibodies to pure dt­
 xxxg641xxx  and showed that only 45% of the n ad(p)h activity of triton x- 1 00
solubilized microsomes (the warfarin-sensitive fraction) could be neutralized
with this antibody. they concluded that about one half of the nad(p)h­
dependent reductase activity in microsomes is due to a warfarin-insensitive
reductase different from dt- xxxg641xxx . this warfarin-insensitive enzyme
appears to be the one relevant to 'y-glutamyl carboxylation that is reduced in
activity by riboflavin deficiency (202).
fasco & principe (7 1 ) identified vitamin kh2 as a product of dtt reduction
of  xxxd3522xxx  in intact rat liver microsomes. this enzyme is sensitive to warfarin
inhibition (ca 1 p..m ) . this system also produced kh2 from k-2,3-epoxide in
accord with the observations of whitlon et al (283), who found in intact liver
microsomes from  xxxd3522xxx -deficient rats that dtt would support protein
carboxylation better than nad(p)h, particularly at low levels of  xxxd3522xxx . in

their studies, warfarin (0. 1 6 mm) totally inhibited these reductases, whereas
the nao(p)h reductases were not inhibited (70).
kinetic studies by fasco & principe (69) then revealed that the ott-driven
reduction of  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide in microsomes was an ordered reaction
resulting in the fonnation first of  xxxd3522xxx  and later, after attaining a certain
steady-state level of the quinone, vitamin kh2. the amounts of warfarin
required for inhibition of the two reductase activities were, for susceptible and
warfarin-resistant rats, different by 2-3-fold. fasco & lee (67) have suggested
that this ordered reaction by the ott-driven  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide reductase
may be explained by assuming that ko and k reductions occur at separate
catalytic sites and that an essential disulfide, reducible by ott, supplies
reducing equivalents for both reductions.

terminal oxidation sequence
wiss & gloor (287) observed that the principal excretory fonn of  xxxd3522xxx  in
rat urine was a metabolite resembling the lactone of  xxxd3521xxx  first described by
simon & colleagues (237) . it was iden!ified as a chain-shortened and oxidized
derivative of  xxxd3522xxx  that fonns a j'-lactone and is probably excreted as a
glucuronide. similar studies have been carried out by shearer and colleagues in
humans (233). this confinns the oxidation pathway for degradation of vitamin
k involving w-oxidation followed by j3-oxidation of the side chain toward the
ring to generate the 6 ' -carboxylic acid (v) and 'y-iactone (vi) (figure 8). in
addition, they showed further that a new, additionally foreshortened 4 ' ­
carboxylic acid (iv) was present. these phylloquinone metabolites were re­
duced to 15% of the total in subjects treated with warfarin in whom analogous
epoxide metabolites (ill and vii) were found ( 1 64) . these metabolites are
usually conjugated with glucuronic acid and participate in an enterohepatic
circulation.

anticoagulant activity in animals and humans. one of the more popular ones in

the oral anticoagulant agents regulate the biosynthesis of prothrombin

hypoprothrombinemia and other factor deficiences at specific rates when given
in saturating doses, even though the half-life of various drugs varies from hours
to days in different animals and in humans. as soon as there is an effective
concentration of the drug,  xxxd3522xxx -dependent factor biosynthesis by liver is
shut off and the factors then decay in plasma at their specific half-lives ( 1 8 1 ) .

investigation, although it seems fairly clear that these agents do not directly
block the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase. as noted earlier, bell & mats­
chiner (10) proposed that the primary action of warfarin was to inhibit vitamin
k-2,3-epoxide reductase and prevent the recycling of the epoxide to  xxxd3522xxx ,
thus reducing the concentration of kh2 in vivo to ineffective levels . this view
has been strongly supported by others (248). more recently, fasco et al (66)
have shown that the dtt-driven  xxxd3522xxx  reductase is more sensitive to
warfarin than the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase in both nonnal and warfarin­
resistant rats and that the  xxxd3522xxx -k0 cycle is blocked at both reduction steps
by warfarin. fasco et al (69) have also observed that warfarin and vitamin
k-2,3-epoxide are not competitive with respect to each other, and that warfarin
binding occurs exclusively to the disulfide (oxidized) fonn of the epoxide
reductase. they speculated that dtt antagonizes warfarin by maintaining the
epoxide reductase in the reduced state. the extent of ko/k elevation in
warfarin-treated rabbits does not correlate well with the dose required for.
anticoagulant activity ( 1 96) .
the kinetics of 4-hydroxycoumarin action in whole animals are not competi­
tive with  xxxd3522xxx  ( 1 29, 1 93) . in vitro, warfarin inhibits  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
carboxylation of prothrombin precursor in rat liver microsomes but has little
effect on the solubilized carboxylase system ( 193). the amount of  xxxd3522xxx 
required by microsomes for carboxylation activity is lower by a factor of 100
than that required in detergent-solubilized preparations. the apparent km for
intact microsomes is about 100 pmoles/g ( 1 20, 283) and corresponds to the
amount actually present in mammalian liver. it is possible that the dtt-driven
 xxxd3522xxx  reductase has a very low km when compared to the nad(p)h­
dependent  xxxd3522xxx  reductase, and hence under physiological conditions the
dti-powered warfarin-sensitive enzyme is the pathway used. in order to
overcome the warfarin block, large amounts of  xxxd3522xxx  are necessary. at
these high levels, the relatively warfarin-insensitive nad(p)h reductases are
used (278), restoring carboxylation as long as kh2 can be formed .
warfarin-binding studies have shown that nonnal microsomes bind warfarin
more tightly and in larger amounts than those from warfarin-resistant rats ( 14 1 ,
263). searcey and colleagues (225) reported the isolation of warfarin-binding
proteins (wbp) for microsomes of normal and warfarin-resistant rats. these
appear to be intrinsic proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum since they are
liberated only by detergent. the warfarin-binding protein isolated from spra­
gue-dawley rats was half-saturated at 8 ij.m warfarin and bound 0.7 mol of
warfarin per mol of protein at saturation. the corresponding protein from
warfarin-resistant rats did not saturate at levels of 30 ij.m warfarin and bound
only 0. 1 mol of warfarin per mol of protein. the molecular weight of the
binding protein from both nonnal and warfarin-resistant rats was 32,000 by
sds-gel electrophoresis. maximum warfarin binding by the protein from

and tryptic digestion . the (s)-enantiomer of warfarin was the preferred ligand.
on the basis of these data it is likely that this protein is the warfarin receptor
protein that mediates the effect of the drug on prothrombin synthesis. the
isolated protein showed no enzymatic activity, which could have been lost

during the isolation procedure .
difenacoum and brodifacoum are more potent and persistent antagonists to
 xxxd3522xxx  than warfarin ( 1 30, 1 94). they appear to have the same general
mode of action-i . e . to inhibit  xxxd3522xxx  or  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductases with
elevation of the ko:k ratio in plasma in liver-but have a much higher affinity
for these enzymes and a longer duration of action . these agents were equally
effective in the susceptible and the warfarin-resistant rats ( 1 05 ) .

salicylate and other drugs
salicylate in doses greater than 6 g per day can induce hypoprothrombinemia in
humans. the mechanism appears to be di fferent from that of the 4hydroxycoumarin drugs even though plasma ko:k ratios were found to rise in
rabbits and the effect of salicylate could be overcome by high doses of vitamin
k ( l 9s). hildebrandt & suttie ( 1 04) observed that although hepatic ko:k
ratios increased with salicylate treatment of rats, there was no effect in vitro on
the  xxxd3522xxx -2 ,3-epoxide reductase. there was a marked effect, however, on
dt- xxxg641xxx  and vitamin-k + nadh-driven carboxylation . these authors
concluded that the pharmacologic effect of salicylate is on  xxxd3522xxx  reductase
and that the effects on the epoxide reductase and the ko:k ratio are indirect .
ticrynafen [ 2 , 3 -dichloro-4-(2-thienyl-carbonyl)-phenoxy acetic acid] a
nonsulfonamide diuretic, uricosuric, and antihypertensive agent, which causes
hypoprothrombinemia in humans, has the same effect as salicylate in the rat. it
markedly inhibits dt- xxxg641xxx  and tends to cause a rise in hepatic vitamin
ko:k ratios ( 1 99).
broad spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics (moxam®, cefamandol®) have
been observed to cause  xxxd3522xxx -reversible hemorrhage in humans ( 1 08 ) .
lipsky ( 1 40) reported that the n-methylthiotetrazole moiety o f these antibiotics
could block  xxxd3522xxx -dependent peptide carboxylation in triton-solubilized
rat liver microsomes in a dose-dependent manner. uotila & suttie (268)
verified the effect of these antibiotics on the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase
in vitro. this inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to pentapeptide and
kh2 and was partially reversed by pyridoxal-s' -phosphate .
 xxxd2924xxx , an anticonvulsant drug, has been observed to reduce
prothrombin levels in adults but particularly to increase the susceptibility of
infants born of epileptic mothers to  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency ( 1 83 ) .

 xxxd398xxx 
recently it has been reported that toxic doses of  xxxd398xxx 
(bht) cause a hemorrhagic death in rats (262) . the mechanism of this effect
involves an antagonism to  xxxd3522xxx  as indicated by a fall in the vitamin
k-dependent coagulation proenzymes and correction of the defect by added
phylloquinone (258). in a recent paper, suzuki and co-workers (257) reported
that the  xxxd3522xxx  content of the livers of rats fed 0.25 % bht was reduced, and
fecal excretion of  xxxd3522xxx  metabolites was increased compared to controls .
these authors concluded that bht was not acting as a coumarin-like  xxxd2180xxx ­
ist, but may be inhibiting the uptake of  xxxd3522xxx  by intestinal or liver cells.
takahashi & hiraga (26 1 ) have recently reported that the quinone methide of
bht (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylene-2,5-cyclohexadienone) a metabolite of
bht, inhibits  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase in rats 20-30% . no effect of this
compound was noted on vitamin kh2 or vitamin-k + nadh-driven carboxyla­
tion. strangely,  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide given to rats with bht-induced hypothrom­
binemia restored prothrombin levels to normal. further studies of bht poison­
ing are indicated.

vitamins a and e
the fat-soluble vitamins a and e are known to antagonize  xxxd3522xxx . it has
been recognized since 1 944 ( 1 39) that hypervitaminosis a in the rat leads to
hemorrhages and hypoprothrombinemia that can be prevented by the adminis­
tration of  xxxd3522xxx . matschiner & doisy ( 1 6 1 ) found there was a close
relationship between the level of dietary  xxxd3105xxx  (above normal) and the
resulting deficiency of  xxxd3522xxx  as expressed by depressed prothrombin levels
in rats . the effect of  xxxd3105xxx  was more severe in males than in females , and
 xxxd3417xxx  was more effective than  xxxd3105xxx  acetate . in a subsequent paper
in which the anti-coagulant effects of squalene and  xxxd3417xxx  were studied in
adult male rats, matschiner and colleagues ( 1 59) observed that 0.5% squalene
or 50 i. v .  xxxd3417xxx  per day increased the  xxxd3522xxx  requirement to 10 times
that seen in germ-free rats. no effect of parenterally administered  xxxd3417xxx 
was observed. these investigators concluded that the action of excess vitamin
a was to prevent the absorption of  xxxd3522xxx .
large amounts of  xxxd3521xxx  may also antagonize the action of  xxxd3522xxx .
march et al ( 1 52) observed that when diets containing 2200 l.v.  xxxd3521xxx  per
kilogram were fed to chicks, prothrombin times were lengthened . this
prothrombin deficiency was responsive to  xxxd3522xxx . prolongation of
prothrombin times as a result of megavitamin e therapy has also been reported
in humans ( 1 26). this conditioned  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency in human subjects
taking megadoses of  xxxd3521xxx  has also been expressed as a hypersensitivity to
the coumarin anticoagulant drugs. corrigan & marcus (39) reported clinical
evidence of  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency in a patient taking 5 mg warfarin, 2.0 g of
 xxxd1724xxx , and 1 200 i. v. of  xxxd3521xxx  each day. vpon discontinuation of his

megavitamin e therapy, the bleeding tendency and prolonged prothrombin
time normalized. lesser doses of  xxxd3521xxx  in humans (42 i. u . per day for 30
days) do not potentiate the anticoagulant effects of warfarin (224).
the question of whether this antagonism between  xxxd3521xxx  and phyllo­
quinone is exercised at the level of absorption or metabolism remains unsettled.
woolley (288) first observed in rats that a-tocopherolquinone in large doses
caused hemorrhages that could be prevented by  xxxd2563xxx . these observations
were confrrmed in pregnant rats by rao & mason (208) .
olson & jones ( 1 88, 1 89) observed that high dietary intakes of  xxxd3521xxx  in
rats antagonize  xxxd3522xxx  activity and increase the  xxxd3522xxx  requirement.
 xxxd3521xxx  does not appear to affect  xxxd3522xxx  uptake or distribution from the
gut, nor does  xxxd3521xxx  directly affect the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase in
vitro.
although the tocopherolquinone can be produced in vitro by fecl3 or other
oxidative agents, it is not clear what amounts of quinone and hydroquinone are
formed after ingestion of  xxxd3521xxx  in various animals. apparently, the
amounts normally formed in vivo are small (4 1 ) and probably vary with the
amount of  xxxd3521xxx  administered. it has been reported that there is a
marked increase of tocopherylquinone in the livers of mice after intraperitoneal
administration of large amounts of a- xxxd3389xxx  (4).
bettger, jones & olson ( 15) found that d-a-tocopherolquinone (d-a-tq) is a
more potent antagonist of  xxxd3522xxx  activity in the rat than d- xxxd3521xxx .
neither compound appeared to affect the absorption of distribution of vitamin
k. feeding high levels of  xxxd3521xxx  to rats (2 g/kg diet) resulted in an increase
in d-a-tq in liver microsomes from 2.5 nmol/g to 9.4 nmollg. the microsomal
concentration of d-a-tq appears to be of physiological importance in its role as
a  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist, since d-a-tq inhibits  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxy­
lase activity in vitro at these concentrations. a variety of antioxidants also
antagonize  xxxd3522xxx  activity in vivo; however, only n-propyl gallate is a
potent inhibitor of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase in vitro.
nutritional requirements for  xxxd3522xxx 
in humans

sources of  xxxd3522xxx 
 xxxd3522xxx  is derived both from foods and from the microflora of the gut. the
 xxxd3522xxx  content of common foods have been determined by bioassay in
chicks and by hplc chromatography ( 1 83). much of the older work using
bioassay techniques must be repeated to develop better values. in general ,
green leafy vegetables are high, fruits and cereals low, and meats and dairy
products intermediate in concentration. in fact, the intestinal absorption of
 xxxd3522xxx  from plant sources ranges from 30% to 70% of the actual content
determined by extraction. in human liver, rietz and associates (21 1 ) have

demonstrated the presence of menaquinone-7 , menaquinone-8, menaquinone9 (2h), menaquinone-9 (4h), menaquinone- l o , and menaquinone- l l in addi­
tion to phylloquinone. it is clear that the distribution of  xxxd3522xxx  homologs in

mammalian liver reflects both dietary and bacterial sources of the vitamin

present in their intestinal tracts . tobacco is one of the richest sources of
phylloquinone known, containing about 5 mg/ !00 g. a small percentage of this
 xxxd3522xxx  is volatilized in smoking and is absorbed through the mucous
membranes of the nasal pharynx and bronchi.

vitamin

k

deficiency

primary  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency is uncommon in both animals and humans. this
is due to widespread distribution of  xxxd3522xxx  in plant and animal tissues and to
the microbiological flora of the normal gut, which synthesize the mena­
quinones in amounts that may supply the bulk of the requirement for  xxxd3522xxx  .
the causes of deficiencies i n the  xxxd3522xxx -'-<iependent coagulation factors in
humans are largely secondary to disease or drug therapy and are presented in
table 4 .
hemorrhagic disease of the newborn

newborn infants represent a
special case of  xxxd3522xxx  nutrition because (a) the placenta is a relatively poor
organ for the transmission of lipids, and (b) the gut is sterile during the first few
days after birth. in normal infants , the plasma prothrombin concentration, and
that of the other  xxxd3522xxx -'-<iependent factors, may decrease to a level as low as
30% in the second and the third days of life . as food is taken, the levels
gradually climb to normal adult values over a period of weeks . human milk is a
poorer source of  xxxd3522xxx  (2 /lg/liter) than cow's milk ( 1 0 /lg/liter) (23 1 ) . if
prothrombin values fall below 10% , hemorrhagic disease of the newborn
appears (3 1). premature infants are even more susceptible to  xxxd3522xxx  de­
ficiency than are full-term infants .

infants of mothers on hydantoin anticonvulsants should have prophylactic
 xxxd3522xxx  because  xxxd2924xxx  is an antagonist to  xxxd3522xxx  (65).
neonatal complications such as diarrhea, malabsorption, cystic fibrosis,
idiopathic cholestasis, atresia of the bile duct, and prolonged parenteral nutri­
tion are indications for intramuscular  xxxd3522xxx  administration.
healthy adult subjects fed low- xxxd3522xxx  diets ( 1 0
f.lg per day) for periods of several weeks show minimal signs of  xxxd3522xxx 
deficiency (i.e. plasma prothrombin values of 60-90%) unless they are also
given bowel-sterilizing antibiotics such as neomycin (77 , 267). in one study of
apoplectic patients , intravenous nutrition plus neomycin was required to lower
the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent clotting factors to below 20% of normal (77) in four
weeks. the intravenous administration of  xxxd3522xxx  in various doses (0.03- 1 . 5
f.lg/k) to these patients caused a proportional rise in the concentration of these
depressed values to normal levels. in unusual cases, self-imposed dietary
restriction induces hypoprothrombinemia with hemorrhage responsive to oral
 xxxd3522xxx  (2, 1 24). dietary deficiency of  xxxd3522xxx  becomes manifest more
quickly in debilitated patients with or without antibiotics (3).

dietary inadequacy

 xxxd3210xxx 

with the advent of subclavian-vein
catheterization in 1 968 for long-term parenteral nutrition of both surgical and
medical patients unable to eat, new nutritional deficiency syndromes have been
reported (55), among which is hemorrhage due to  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency (2 1 5) .
physiologic amounts of the fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamins e and k ,
are not metabolized normally when introduced into the central venous circula­
tion. it is advisable to give doses of i mg phylloquinone per week (equivalent to
about 1 50 f.lg  xxxd3522xxx  per day) in cases of prolonged total parenteral
nutrition.

biliary .obstruction
prior to the discovery of  xxxd3522xxx  and the recogni­
tion of its deficiency in obstructive jaundice, bleeding commonly occurred after
surgical correction of biliary obstruction (26). because the secretion of bile
salts is essential for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, it is not
surprising that biliary obstruction was early identified as a cause of  xxxd3522xxx 
deficiency. all patients with obstructive jaundice should receive parenteral
 xxxd3522xxx  \ (5 mg per day) for three days prior to surgery.
malabsorption syndrome
depression of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
. coagulation factors is frequently found in the malabsorption syndromes and in
other gastrointestinal disorders (e. g . cystic fibrosis, sprue, celiac disease,
ulcerative colitis , regional ileitis , ascaris infection, and short-bowel syn­
drome) .

liver disease
patients with parenchymal liver disease may have hypo­
prothrombinemia and an elevation in plasma des--y-carboxyprothrombin. they
are unable to utilize  xxxd3522xxx  in the biosynthesis of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
clotting factors , usually as a result of destruction of the rough reticulum in the
hepatocyte. patients with liver disease, however, should be challenged with
 xxxd3522xxx  to determine the extent of the organic disorder preventing biosynthe­
sis of prothrombin . to do this, a parenteral dose of 10 mg daily for three days
should be administered.
drug therapy

coumarin and related anticoagulants the coumarin anticoagulant drugs can
induce serious hypoprothrombinemia. some of the contributory causes are
reduction in dietary intake of  xxxd3522xxx , ingestion of interfering drugs, and the
inadvertent alteration of the anticoagulant dosage schedule. salicylates in large
doses may also depress  xxxd3522xxx -dependent factors.
broad-spectrum antibiotics intestinal bacteria comprise an important source
of  xxxd3522xxx  in humans. as has been mentioried, the gastrointestinal flora may
supply an individual 's entire requirement. however,  xxxd3522xxx  is not well
absorbed from the colon. udall (267) showed that large amounts of  xxxd3522xxx 
(of the order to 500 mg per day) instilled into the cecum did not elevate
depressed coagulation factors in anticoagulated patients, whereas the same
dose given orally gave a prompt response . it appears that the microorganisms
synthesizing  xxxd3522xxx  in the gut must reside in the ileum, where absorption of
 xxxd3522xxx  is possible.
sulfa drugs, neomycin, and other broad-spectrum antibiotics are capable of
sterilizing the bowel and inducing hemorrhagic syndrome. cephalosporin
antibiotics, in addition, inhibit dt- xxxg641xxx  and further compromise the
supply of kh2 for carboxylation .

as discussed earlier this diuretic can cause hypoprothrom­

fat-soluble vitamins as mentioned in a previous section, large amounts of
vitamins a and e may antagonize the action of  xxxd3522xxx .

 xxxd3522xxx  requirements
the  xxxd3522xxx  requirement of mammals is met by a combination of dietary
intake and microbiologic biosynthesis in the gut. furthermore, genetic factors
influence the  xxxd3522xxx  requirement in both animals and humans . in conven­
tional rats , the  xxxd3522xxx  requirement is about 10 fj.g/kg/day supplied in 0. 1
fj.g/g food, whereas in germ-free rats the requirement is more than doubled to

about 25 j.lg/kg/day ( 1 33). chicks have a higher requirement of 50 j.lg/kg/day,
equivalent to 0.5 j.lg/g food.
in human subjects, the  xxxd3522xxx  homologs stored in the liver suggest that
about 40-50% of the daily requirement is derived from plant sources (that is,
vitamin kt) and the remainder from microbiologic biosynthesis. both phyllo­
quinone and menaquinone are present in human plasma (38, 133, 234).
phylloquinone is present in the range of 0.5-5 .0 ng/ml with an average of 2
ng/ml in healthy persons. menaquinone is present in lower amounts. by
assuming that the intravenous dose of  xxxd3522xxx  required to raise depressed
levels of  xxxd3522xxx  to normal for i day is i j.lglkg (77), and that 50% of the
 xxxd3522xxx  appearing in the lumen of the gut each day is absorbed , the total daily
requirement for the vitamin would be 2 j.lg/kg/day . if, however, one assumes
that 50% of the requirement is derived from intestinal microorganisms, then the
dietary requirement would be reduced again to 1 j.lg/kg/day. these assumptions
need further experimental verification.
with the information at hand, this is a rough estimate, particularly because
there is controversy concerning the relative activity of phylloquinone and the
menaquinones in stimulating prothrombin synthesis ( l i s , 1 62). a "normal
mixed diet" in the united states contains 300-500 j.lg  xxxd3522xxx  per day, an
amount more than adequate to supply the dietary requirement of  xxxd3522xxx  .

summary and conclusions
since the discovery of 'y-carboxyglutamic acid a decade ago, great progress has
been made in advancing our knowledge of the function and metabolism of
 xxxd3522xxx  . the distribution of this new amino acid in proteins of diverse origin
and the presence of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase in diverse tissues
have emphasized the widespread significance in biology of a new triad: vitamin
k, gla, and calcium.
new knowledge has been obtained on the importance of the utilization and
reutilization of  xxxd3522xxx  , whose body pools are extremely low for a fat-soluble
vitamin, for the posttranslational carboxylation of peptide-bound glutamate
residues in the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins. the regulation of the activation
of the  xxxd3522xxx - xxxd3522xxx -epoxide cycle by drugs and nutrients appears to be
the key to controlling the synthesis of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins, eight of
which are involved in blood coagulation. the purification of the vitamin
k-dependent 'y-glutamyl carboxylase has turned out to be a more formidable
task than anyone had imagined. many of the questions about its complicated
mechanism, utilizing as it does four substrates (kh2, o2 , co2, and a glu­
containing peptide) , cannot be answered until the enzyme is homogeneous.
basically, the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase system consists of a spe­
cialized microsomal electron transport system coupled to a carbon dioxide

fixation. the reaction does not require atp but apparently utilizes the energy
of vitamin kh2 oxidation to perform the chemical work required in gla
synthesis. why a quinone is employed in this system when other mechanisms
exist for co2 fixation is still mysterious unless the whole process goes by one
electron transport. whether the final co2 addition t� the "v-methylene group of
 xxxd2431xxx  is a radical reaction is unsettled. since this enzyme is an intrinsic
membrane-bound protein, the scientific attack on its structure and function is at
one of the present frontiers of molecular biology . a view of the synthesis of
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins in the rer is shown in figure 9.
finally, the nutritional requirements for  xxxd3522xxx  in humans are unknown.
an unknown fraction of  xxxd3522xxx  in humans is derived from menaquinone
biosynthesis in the intestinal flora. contributions from diet and biosynthesis
have not yet been quantitated. sensitive hplc methods for measuring plasma
phylloquinone are now available , and related methods for measuring long­
chain menaquinones can be developed .
