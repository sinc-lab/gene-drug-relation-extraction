1. introduction
in cardiomyocytes, the rapid component of the delayed
rectifier k 1 current, ikr [4] is an important repolarizing
potassium current. ikr is encoded by the human ether-a-gogo-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ). this has been demonstrated in
macroscopic current measurements [37,47] and single
channel measurements [22,53]. many class iii antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the cardiac action potential and thereby
the refractory period by blocking ikr . likewise, block of
 xxxg1246xxx  channels by various drugs has been investigated
previously [40,22,23,45,46,3,51,20].
in patients after myocardial infarction [19,36,10] and
dilated cardiomyopathy [26,17,50], arrhythmias are a

major cause of death. in theory, the prolongation of the
cardiac refractory period makes the heart less susceptible
for cardiac arrhythmias [18]. although, prolonging the
refractory period has the possibility of both antiarrhythmic
and proarrhythmic potential, particularly where na 1 channel blockade increases both the refractory period and the
vulnerable period [43,44,9]. for class iii antiarrhythmic
drugs, outcomes of clinical trials show overall beneficial
effects for amiodarone [5,35,13] and significant increases
of the postinfarction mortality for the pure class iii drug
d-sotalol [49].
the aryloxypropanolamine carvedilol (1-(9h-carbazol4-yloxy)-3-[[2-(2 - methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-propa nol) is a multiple-action cardiovascular drug: a competitive
inhibition of b-1 [41], b-2 [14] and a-1 receptors [42,38]
is part of its neurohumoral properties. it is a calciumtime for primary review 26 days.

objective: the aryloxypropanolamine carvedilol is a multiple action cardiovascular drug with blocking effects on a-receptors,
b-receptors, ca 21 -channels, na 1 -channels and various native cardiac k 1 channels, thereby prolonging the cardiac action potential. in a
number of clinical trials with patients suffering from congestive heart failure, carvedilol appeared to be superior to other b-blocking
agents in reducing total mortality. given the multiple pharmacological actions of carvedilol, this may be due to specific channel blockade
rather than b-antagonistic activity. since human ether-a-go-go related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ) k 1 channels play a critical role in the pathogenesis of
cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, the effects of carvedilol on  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 channels were investigated. methods: doubleelectrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed on  xxxg1246xxx  potassium channels which were expressed heterologously in xenopus
oocytes. results: carvedilol at a concentration of 10 mm blocked  xxxg1246xxx  potassium tail currents by 47%. the electrophysiological
characteristics of  xxxg1246xxx , i.e. activation, steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation were not affected by carvedilol.
inhibition of current gradually increased from 0% immediately after the test pulse to about 80% at 600 ms with subsequent marginal
changes of current kinetics during the resting 29 s, indicating a very fast open channel block by carvedilol as the major blocking
mechanism. conclusion: this is the first study demonstrating that carvedilol blocks  xxxg1246xxx  potassium channels. the biophysical data
presented in this study with a potentially antiarrhythmic effect may contribute to the positive outcome of clinical trials with carvedilol.

2. methods

2.1. solutions and drug administration
two-microelectrode voltage clamp measurements of
xenopus oocytes were performed in a physiologically low
k 1 solution containing (in mm) 5 kcl, 100 nacl, 1.5
 xxxg2125xxx  2 , 2 mgcl 2 , and 10 hepes (ph 7.3). current and
voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m kcl solution.
carvedilol (hoffmann-la roche, usa) was dissolved in
ethanol to a stock solution of 100 mm and stored at 148c.
on the day of experiments, aliquots of the stock solution
were diluted to the desired concentration with the bath
solution. with the highest concentration of 100 mm of the
drug, the ethanol concentration was 0.1%; although, 0.1%
ethanol alone only minimally reduced inward tail currents
(by 2.0760.89%, n53, at 2120 mv, after a test pulse to
100 mv; data not shown). all measurements were carried
out at room temperature (208c). the volume of the bath
chamber was 150 ml; after solution switch, it took about 4
s for the new solution to reach the bath (tubing length of
about 37 cm); at a flow-rate of 1 ml / min, solution in the
bath was totally exchanged within 9 s. in general, record-

ing began 30 s after solution switch. all measurements
were done under steady-state conditions at least 2 min after
total solution exchange.

2.2. electrophysiology and data analysis
the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp configuration
was used to record currents from xenopus laevis oocytes.
microelectrodes had tip resistances ranging from 1 to 5
mv. data were low-pass filtered at 1–2 khz (23 db,
four-pole bessel filter) before digitalization at 5–10 khz.
recordings were performed using a commercially available amplifier (warner oc-725a, warner instruments,
hamden, ct, usa) and pclamp software (axon instruments, foster city, ca, usa) for data acquisition and
analysis. no leak subtraction was done during the experiments. for activating currents, absolute values have been
taken for analysis. for description of tails, currents were
expressed relative to the baseline at the holding potential
(280 mv). dose–response curves were fitted with the hill
equation
i /i0 5 i0 /(1 1 x / ic 50 )n
where i /i0 is the relative current, i0 the unblocked current
amplitude, x the carvedilol concentration, ic 50 the dose
for half maximal block and n the hill coefficient.
steady-state inactivation curves were fitted with a
boltzmann distribution
y 5 h1 1 exp [(v1 / 2 2v ) /k]j 21
where v1 / 2 represents the half-maximal activation potential, y the degree of steady-state inactivation and k is the
slope factor.
statistical data are expressed as mean6standard error
where n represents the number of experiments performed.
statistical significance was evaluated using the paired
student’s t-test. differences were considered to be significant when the p value was ,0.05.

2.3. expression of  xxxg1246xxx  channels in xenopus oocytes
the  xxxg1246xxx  clone was a gift from m.t. keating (salt
lake city, ut, usa).  xxxg1246xxx  complementary rna was
prepared from the  xxxg1246xxx  cdna [37] in the psp64 plasmid
with the mmessage mmachine in vitro transcription
kit (ambion) by use of sp6 polymerase after linearization
with ecori (boehringer mannheim). injection of rna
(50–500 ng / ml) into stage v and vi defolliculated oocytes
was performed by using a nanoject automatic injector
(drummond, broomall, usa). the volume of injected
crna solution was 50 nl per oocyte, and measurements
were made 2–10 days after injection. the investigation
conforms with the guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals published by the us national institutes of health (nih publication no. 85-23, revised 1996).

channel blocker [32] and sodium-channel modulator [27].
it has inhibitory effects on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)
receptors [27] and antioxidant activity has also been
described for carvedilol [52].
potassium currents generated by several native k 1
channels in cardiomyocytes [11], i.e. ikr (the rapid component of the delayed rectifier k 1 current), iks (the slow
component of the delayed rectifier k 1 current) and ito (the
transient outward k 1 current), have also been blocked by
carvedilol, resulting in a prolongation of cardiac action
potential [6]. however, in ecgs of patients treated with
carvedilol, a significant qt prolongation was not observed
[39].
the pharmacological profile of carvedilol explains the
wide spectrum of therapeutical effects. carvedilol is
advantageous in the treatment of hypertension and chronic
stable angina [48]. it reduces infarct size by protecting
against lethal reperfusion injury [2]. it has been demonstrated that carvedilol inhibits aortic lipid deposition in
hypercholesterolemia [15] and attenuates vascular remodeling by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [34]. several clinical studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of carvedilol on the overall survival in congestive heart failure [1,33,12,8]. however, the reason for the
particular effectiveness of this agent in congestive heart
failure remains unclear, so far. one theoretical explanation
would be a decline of fatal arrhythmia, which represent a
major complication of congestive heart failure. so, in this
study, we demonstrate the blockage of the  xxxg1246xxx  potassium current by carvedilol contributing to its putative
class-iii antiarrhythmic properties.

3. results

3.1. inhibition of  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 currents by carvedilol
to investigate the effect of carvedilol on cloned  xxxg1246xxx 
k 1 currents, two-microelectrode voltage clamp experiments were performed on xenopus oocytes heterologously
expressing the  xxxg1246xxx  channel. first the control measurements were obtained (fig. 1a), then the carvedilol (10
mm) was washed into the bath for 10 min, and the
measurements with carvedilol (fig. 1b) were made. currents were measured with an i–v protocol. from a holding

potential of 280 mv test pulses from 280 to 180 mv in
10-mv increments (400 ms) were applied at a frequency of
0.2 hz to measure activating currents. each pulse was
followed by a constant return pulse to 260 mv (400 ms) to
evoke outward tail currents.  xxxg1246xxx  currents had an
activation threshold of 240 mv, reached a current maximum  xxxd1891xxx  mv before a considerable current reduction at
higher test pulse amplitudes could be measured, as a result
of inward rectification. fig. 1c shows the current–voltage
relationship (i–v curve) at the end of the test pulse. after
application of 10 mm carvedilol (fig. 1b), the peak current
amplitude ( xxxd1891xxx  mv) was reduced by 46.163.6% (n54;

for a typical measurement in a xenopus oocyte expressing  xxxg1246xxx  potassium channels. the maximum outward current (after a test pulse to 0 mv) was
reduced by 44.1% (c). the peak tail current was reduced by 50.7% after the test pulse to 30 mv (d). activating currents normalized to their peak are
shown in (e) tail currents normalized to their maximum are shown in (f). pulse protocol: holding potential 280 mv, test pulses from 280 to 180 mv

fig. 1c). under carvedilol, the increase of activating
current graph with subsequent saturation developed faster
than in the control, which has to be interpreted as a sign of
open channel block.
the amplitude of the outward tail currents in the return
pulse partially exceeded the amplitude of the activating
current due to slow activation, fast inactivation, rapid
recovery from inactivation and slow deactivation. (this
has been described elsewhere [22,24,37,40]). tail currents
saturated after a test pulse amplitude of 140 mv or above
(fig. 1d). carvedilol in a concentration of 10 mm reduced

the peak tail current amplitude (after a test pulse to 40 mv)
by 46.563.7% (n54) (fig. 1d). normalized activating
and normalized tail currents for control and 10 mm
carvedilol were scaled in fig. 1e and f.

subsequently, a series of 50 constant pulses to 30 mv
(400 ms) at a frequency of 0.07 hz served to investigate
the onset of carvedilol-induced inhibition of  xxxg1246xxx  k 1
outward tail currents (fig. 2a). after nine recordings,

investigate onset and washout of  xxxg1246xxx  tail current block by carvedilol (a and b). corresponding currents normalized to the peak activating current are
shown in (c and d). after nine control measurements (0–150 s) demonstrating the stability of the experimental conditions, carvedilol in a concentration of
10 mm was perfused into the bath and achieved an inhibition of 36.2% within 90 s. after 12 min, the inhibition was 47.7% (e). in a subsequent series,
carvedilol was washed out after another nine measurements resulting in a partial recovery of current by 60.4% (f). voltage protocol for (a and b): holding
potential 280 mv, test pulses 130 mv and return pulses 260 mv (400 ms each).

demonstrating steady-state conditions, carvedilol was
washed into the bath at a concentration of 10 mm. steadystate block was already achieved at step 16, i.e. within 90
s. thereby, the current was reduced by 36.2%. finally, at
step 50, i.e. after 750 s from the beginning of the
experiment, a total reduction by 47.7% could be measured
(fig. 2e). a similar result was found in n56 experiments;
thereby, 50% of maximal block was achieved within
28.3361.08 s, 75% in 45.6760.88 s and 90% in
60.6761.78 s.
the washout of carvedilol was investigated with the
same electrophysiological protocol (fig. 2b). after nine
recordings during steady-state block by 10 mm carvedilol,
the substance was washed out. the washout was almost
complete within 3 min, reaching 80.061.0% (n53) of the
current amplitude at the beginning of the experiment (fig.
2f). currents in fig. 2a and b were normalized to the
peak activating current in fig. 2c and d. during the first
400 ms of activation, a time-dependent decrease of current
with 10 mm carvedilol could be registered (fig. 2c), a
sign for fast open channel block. after washout, this
current decrease was reversible (fig. 2d).

3.3. concentration-dependence of block

3.4. carvedilol does not affect the steady-state
inactivation of  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 current
to measure inactivation, a special protocol was used
that inactivates the channel at a holding potential of 120
mv, recovers the channel from inactivation at various
potentials from 2120 to 30 mv (15 ms) in 10-mv steps,
and measures the resulting peak outward current at constant 120 mv as a measure of steady-state inactivation
(fig. 4c). having obtained the control measurement
shown in fig. 4a, we washed in carvedilol at a concentration of 10 mm for 15 min and held the oocyte during
this period of time at 280 mv. in this set of experiments, a
holding potential of 280 mv was necessary to prevent
destruction of the oocyte that usually occurs when holding
the oocyte 15 min at 120 mv. finally, the measurements
with carvedilol were made, as shown in fig. 4b. in fig.
4d, the inactivating outward current amplitude (measured
at constant 20 mv) was normalized and plotted against the

the concentration-dependence of carvedilol-induced
inhibition was measured on  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 tail current amplitudes. from a holding potential of 280 mv, test pulses
to 130 mv (400 ms) and return pulses to 260 mv (400
ms) were applied (fig. 3a). the effect of carvedilol on the
tail current at 260 mv was concentration dependent, i.e.
carvedilol in a concentration of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mm blocked
the tail current to 96.061.8, 91.662.2, 53.164.5,
14.467.6% (n54) of the control, respectively. the normalized dose response curve was fitted with a dose–

values for n54). currents were normalized and the fitted dose–response

distribution and did not show any significant shift after the
application of carvedilol in four experiments [dv1 / 2 5

3.5. carvedilol does not affect activation of  xxxg1246xxx  k 1
currents
the effect of carvedilol on activation kinetics of  xxxg1246xxx 
k 1 currents was investigated by measuring activation
curves. activation curves were obtained with a protocol,
where we applied variable test pulses ranging from 2120
to 1100 mv (200 ms) in 10-mv increments, and measured

fig. 4. carvedilol does not affect steady-state inactivation of  xxxg1246xxx  k
current. to measure inactivation, a special protocol was used that
inactivates the channel at a holding potential of 120 mv, recovers the
channel from inactivation at various potentials from 2120 to 30 mv (15
ms) in 10-mv steps, and measures the resulting peak outward current at
constant 120 mv as a measure of steady-state inactivation. resulting
outward currents 2 ms after the final step to 120 mv were displayed for
control (a) and 10 mm carvedilol (b) as a function of the test pulse
potential in (c). current amplitudes were normalized resulting in the
inactivation curves in (d). carvedilol did not produce any shift in the
normalized steady-state inactivation curves from n54 experiments.

the corresponding inward tail current amplitude at 2120
mv (fig. 5a and b). the inverted tail current amplitude
was displayed against the test pulse potential, resulting in a
normalized tail current curve that was a measure of steadystate activation (fig. 5c). in fig. 5d the activation curves
for control and with carvedilol (10 mm) were normalized
for n54 experiments. there was no significant shift in the
activation curve (dv1 / 2 5 0.860.8 mv, p.0.05, (n54
experiments)).

fig. 5. carvedilol does not affect activation of  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 currents
activation curves of  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 currents were measured in a protocol
with inward tail currents in a representative experiment. the control
measurement is shown in (a). the measurement with carvedilol is shown
in (b). in (c) the tail current amplitude is displayed against the test pulse
voltage in the previous step. in (d) the inverted tail current amplitude
was displayed as a function of the previous test pulse potential resulting
in an activation curve. there was no significant shift in the normalized
activation curve from n54 experiments (d). voltage protocol: holding
potential 280 mv, test pulses from 280 to 180 mv in 10-mv increments
(200 ms) return pulses constant 2120 mv to measure tail currents.

3.6. no frequency and no use-dependence of carvedilol
block
after carvedilol block reached steady-state conditions
(after 2 min) the frequency dependence of block was
investigated.  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 channels were activated by depolarizing pulses to 100 mv (400 ms) at intervals of 15 s
(fig. 6a) and 1 s (fig. 6b) under control conditions and in
the presence of carvedilol. the outward tail currents at
260 mv were subsequently used for analysis. the level of

c. a. karle et al. / cardiovascular research 49 (2001) 361 – 370

steady-state block after 70 s of repetitive step pulses might
be taken as a measure for the frequency dependence of
block. we found, that at both frequencies the current
amplitudes did not change. therefore the block of  xxxg1246xxx 
currents by carvedilol is not frequency and not use-dependent within this protocol that has a test pulse duration of
400 ms according to the qt-interval in the ecg. the lack
of use-dependence despite an open channel block by
carvedilol is mainly caused by the fast velocity of block,
which allows complete inhibition within one single step.
so the subsequent pulses cannot intensify the block.

3.7.  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 channels are blocked by carvedilol
mainly in the open state
to address the question of which state of the channel is

blocked by carvedilol, we measured outward currents with
a special experimental design: firstly we did the control
measurements without carvedilol, then we washed in
carvedilol in a concentration of 100 mm for 2 min while
holding the cell at 280 mv to keep all channels in the
closed state and then made a measurement with a long test
pulse of 30 s at 0 mv. experiments with the same pulse
protocol, but washin-periods of 5 and 10 min were added.
punctual inhibition immediately after the test pulse
would be a measure of closed state block. the amount of
block that would occur gradually during the long test pulse
would be a measure of open state block [20].
control currents and currents after application of carvedilol were normalized to their peak currents and in
additional graphs, the degree of inhibition was shown with
logarithmic and linear time scale.
normalized macroscopic currents over 30 s scaled for
washin periods of 2 and 5 min (fig. 7a and b). although,
analysis of the first 600 ms revealed a steady increase of
inhibition from almost 0% immediately after the test pulse
to about 80% at 600 ms (fig. 7c). this can be interpreted
as a very fast open channel block within the first 400 ms of
the measurements. other experimental findings support
this result as well: the faster development of stable current
under carvedilol where control activating current still
increased (fig. 1) and a slight decrease of activating
current under 10 mm carvedilol during the first 400 ms of
fig. 2c. in fig. 7, the peak current was reached after about
400 ms in all measurements and depending on the washinperiod, the maximum inhibition by 100 mm carvedilol was
69.9364.18% after 2 min and 79.4763.30% after 5 min
(fig. 7a). this slight increase of maximum inhibition
depending on the washin period is compatible with the
onset experiments in fig. 2e showing some further increase of inhibition within this time period.
control experiments over 10 min without any drug
application demonstrated, that there was no significant
time-dependent run-down (n54, data not shown).

4. discussion
this study demonstrates that the  xxxg1246xxx  potassium
channel is blocked by carvedilol. the  xxxg1246xxx  potassium
channel produces the ikr potassium current in cardiomyocytes. recently it has been shown that carvedilol
blocks ikr in isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes. this indicates
that the block of this channel occurs also in native cardiac
cells [6]. the effects of carvedilol on  xxxg1246xxx  in our study
and ikr currents in the study by cheng et al. [6] occurs in a
concentration range similar to concentrations achieved by
carvedilol in a clinical setting. in hypertensive patients
which are treated with carvedilol, plasma concentrations in
a range of 32–252 mg / l have been found [29,31], which
corresponds to concentrations of 0.1–0.6 mm. in com-

parison to the block of ikr in cardiomyocytes (ic 50 50.4
mm; [6]) a higher concentration of carvedilol was necessary in our study to inhibit  xxxg1246xxx  channels expressed in
xenopus oocytes (ic 50 510.4 mm). this difference is
attributed to the viteline membrane and yolk of the
oocytes, which requires up to 10- to 30-fold higher
concentrations for the drug effects [28,20]. taking this into
consideration, this study and the study of cheng et al. [6]
indicate that the block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels by carvedilol is
of therapeutical relevance for treated patients.
clinical trials with carvedilol have proven that this drug
is effective in the therapy of ischemic and idiopathic heart
failure. beneficial effects on mortality and hospitalisation
rate have been demonstrated in the trial of the us
carvedilol heart failure study group. carvedilol reduced
the mortality by 65% in patients with either form of
cardiomyopathy [33]. in the trial of the australia–new
zealand heart failure research collaborative group,
carvedilol increased the left ventricular ejection fraction of
patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease by
5.3% and the rate of death or hospital admission was lower
in the carvedilol group [12]. the mocha multicenter trial
for patients with mild to moderate heart failure demonstrated a decrease of mortality risk by 73% in carvedilol-

treated patients [1]. in the precise trial, a significant
decrease in the combined risk of morbidity and mortality
could be shown for moderate to severe heart failure [33].
sudden cardiac death due to malignant arrhythmias and
pump failure are the most common causes of death in
patients with severe heart failure. although some clinical
trials describe a reduction of ventricular arrhythmias under
carvedilol treatment [39,7], the reduction of sudden death
mortality under carvedilol in the clinical trials have not yet
been explained. it may be possible that the reduction of
malignant arrhythmias and consequently the reduction of
sudden cardiac death may be at least, in part, the result of
an antiarrhythmic effect of carvedilol by blocking  xxxg1246xxx 
potassium channels. this potentially antiarrhythmic effect
together with its b-blocking properties may be responsible
for the positive outcome of the clinical trials.
we found, that blockade of  xxxg1246xxx  potassium channels
by carvedilol appears to occur rather quickly and almost
exclusively on open states (fig. 7c). the lack of usedependence is a sign of very fast development of complete
block already during one short test pulse. the onset of
block by carvedilol is fast and occurred within 2–3 min.
this is much faster than block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels by
dofetilide [22] or block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels by amiodarone

fig. 7.  xxxg1246xxx  k 1 channels are blocked by carvedilol in the open state. channels were held at 280 mv, i.e. in their closed state, before a test pulse to 0 mv
(for 30 s) was applied. shown are mean absolute (n54) (a) and scaled overlay experiments (b) for control and 100 mm carvedilol. per oocyte, only one
control pulse and one consecutive pulse after 2 or 5 min wash-in of 100 mm carvedilol (at 280 mv) was applied. after 2 min, mean recordings (n54)
show a carvedilol-induced peak current reduction by 69.9%. normalized graphs scale for 2 and 5 min of washin. additional graphs show the degree of
inhibition (carvedilol-sensitive current at time x / control current at time x) in percent, beginning 20 ms after the test pulse, with extrapolation for the first 20
ms (c and d). inhibition of current steadily increased from 0% immediately after the test pulse to about 80% at 600 ms with subsequent marginal changes
of current kinetics during the resting 29 s, indicating that mainly open channels were blocked, with weak open channel unblock.

[25]. we speculate, that carvedilol blocks  xxxg1246xxx  channels
with low affinity from the extracellular site of the membrane, because the onset of block is faster than intracellular
block by dofetilide.
in the literature, inactivated  xxxg1246xxx  channels, though,
might be inhibited by the gastrointestinal prokinetic agent
 xxxd1708xxx  [30] and by haloperidol [46]. activated open (or
preactivated closed)  xxxg1246xxx  channels are blocked by the
class iii antiarrhythmic drug dofetilide from the intracellular site by binding to the h5 segment [16,21].
after the negative outcome the sword trial [49] with
the pure class iii drug d-sotalol, recent discussions have
led to the widespread opinion that block of  xxxg1246xxx 
channels is a negative feature of drugs with the induction
of proarrhythmia. we do not support this opinion in
general since the action of a drug on the  xxxg1246xxx  channel
and the resulting cardiac electrophysiological changes
depend strongly on the pharmacological profile of the
drug. for example, the class iii drug amiodarone blocks
 xxxg1246xxx  channels in the closed and open state [25] and
clinical data strongly suggest, that amiodarone is a very
safe and efficious antiarrhythmic drug [5,35,13]. it may be
possible, that an additional therapy with b-blocking agents,
or intrinsic b-blocking activity of the drugs is necessary to
prevent proarrhythmias in a so far unknown mechanism. in
the same line the additional  xxxg1246xxx  blocking activity of
amiodarone or carvedilol may lead to superior clinical
results compared to conventional therapy with pure bblocking agents.
this pharmacological study provides new and detailed
information about the block by carvedilol of the cloned
 xxxg1246xxx   xxxg1232xxx . such detailed pharmacological
studies are not possible to obtain in isolated cardiomyocytes from guinea pig or rabbit or human, because
the ikr current is usually very small. even more so because
in isolated cardiomyocytes it is necessary to block other
currents with compounds that possibly also act on the ikr
current and the voltage protocols in such studies with
cardiomyocytes are very restricted.
