structure-activity relationships for inhibition of  xxxg778xxx  in vitro and inhibition of bone resorption in vivo by nitrogen-con...  it has long been known that small changes to the structure of the r(2) side chain of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can dramatically affect their potency for inhibiting bone resorption in vitro and in vivo, although the reason for these differences in antiresorptive potency have not been explained at the level of a pharmacological target. recently, several nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were found to inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vitro by inhibiting  xxxg778xxx , thereby preventing protein prenylation in osteoclasts. in this study, we examined the potency of a wider range of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, including the highly potent, heterocycle-containing  xxxd3561xxx  and minodronate (ym-529). we found a clear correlation between the ability to inhibit  xxxg778xxx  in vitro, to inhibit protein prenylation in cell-free extracts and in purified osteoclasts in vitro, and to inhibit bone resorption in vivo. the activity of recombinant human  xxxg778xxx  was inhibited at concentrations > or = 1 nm  xxxd3561xxx  or minodronate, the order of potency ( xxxd3561xxx  approximately equal to minodronate >  xxxd3128xxx  >  xxxd2311xxx  > incadronate > alendronate >  xxxd2837xxx ) closely matching the order of antiresorptive potency. furthermore, minor changes to the structure of the r(2) side chain of heterocycle-containing bisphosphonates, giving rise to less potent inhibitors of bone resorption in vivo, also caused a reduction in potency up to approximately 300-fold for inhibition of  xxxg778xxx  in vitro. these data indicate that  xxxg778xxx  is the major pharmacological target of these drugs in vivo, and that small changes to the structure of the r(2) side chain alter antiresorptive potency by affecting the ability to inhibit  xxxg778xxx .
