summary

this study analyses the effects of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists on
rat gastrointestinal transit (git) in an attempt to identify the mechanisms
involved. dopamine (da), apomorphine, quinpirole, bromocriptine and
 xxxd2097xxx  were given by subcutaneous (s.c.), intrathecal (i-t.), intracisternal
(i.c.) and/or intraperitoneal (i.p.) routes. in general, da (200 yg, i-t.),
apomorphine (3, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c; or 10, 30 and 100yg, i-t.), and
bromocriptine (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) elicited decreases in gastrointestinal transit
which were significantly antagonized by the  xxxg656xxx  antagonists  xxxd1927xxx 
or  xxxd115xxx  (both 5 mg/kg, s.c.), but remained unaffected by the d, receptor
antagonist sch 23390 (5 mg/kg, s.c.). similarly, da (50, 100 and 200 yg, i.c.)
and apomorphine (12 and 50 yg; i.c.) produced dose-dependent decreases in
gastrointestinal transit amenable to blockade by the classical da receptor
antagonist haloperidol (10 yg, i.c.). the responses to apomorphine (3, 5 and
10 mg/kg, s.c.) were unaltered by 6-hydroxydopamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced
sympathectomy but were antagonized by both propranolol (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and
 xxxd2914xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.). significantly, after bilateral (cervical) vagotomy,
gastrointestinal transit was markedly reduced, but apomorphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.)
apparently further reduced gastrointestinal transit.

the d, agonists  xxxd2097xxx  (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly reduced
git.  xxxd2097xxx -induced antitransit effects were markedly modified by the d,
receptor antagonist, sch 23390 (5 mg/kg, s.c.); only the response induced by
5 mg/kg of  xxxd2097xxx  was apparently antagonized by sch 23390. the mixed d,
and d; receptor agonist quinpirole (4 and 8 mg/kg, s.c.; or 8 mg/kg, i.p.; 200 ug,
it.) did mimic da eliciting significant reductions in gastrointestinal transit which,
however, were not antagonized by  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.).

taken together, the present results support the contention that the decrease in rat

gastrointestinal transit induced by da and apomorphine may be mediated by an
interaction with central and/or peripheral d, receptors. the presence of dopamine
receptors (d2) in the alimentary canal are strengthened by antitransit effect of
 xxxd2097xxx  and bromocriptine in the gastrointestinal tract.

transit, rat.

introduction

gastrointestinal motility depends basically upon autonomic control by
parasympathetic (excitatory; cholinergic) and sympathetic (inhibitory;
noradrenergic) fibres [1,2]. nevertheless, in addition to acetylcholine and
noradrenaline, other neurotransmitters may be involved. for example, endogenous
dopamine (da) is suggested to play a physiological role in the regulation of some
aspects of gastrointestinal motility and endocrine secretions in several species
including humans [3, 4].

in this context, vagal dopaminergic innervation has been shown in the rodent
alimentary tract [5,6], and da is present in significant amounts in the
gastrointestinal tract [7]. indeed, da exerts an inhibitory effect on the motility of
some gastrointestinal preparations including guinea-pig ileum [8], rabbit ileum
(9], oppossum lower oesophageal sphincter [10,11], dog stomach [12] and rat
jejunum [13]. nevertheless, the identification of the receptors involved in the
above responses to da is contentious, as depending on the species, autonomic and
enteric influences. the enteric system or “intrinsic system” of nerves and ganglia
are found between the longitudinal and circular muscles of the intestine. this layer
is called “brain of the gut” [2], due to its intricate complex nature and because of
its central role in the control of gastrointestinal motility. in addition, depending on
the segment of the gastrointestinal system under study and/or the experimental
circumstances, adrenoceptors and/or da receptors may be involved [4, 13, 14].
with respect to the latter, a large body of evidence has indicated the existence of
at least two da receptor subtypes, namely d, and d, (4, 14, 16]. in the light of
these findings, it is particularly interesting to note that in some gastrointestinal
preparations it is not yet clear whether da is acting through d, or d2 receptors
(for references, see glavin and szabo [16]). with the advent of selective da
receptor agonists and antagonists, a number of da _ receptor-mediated
gastrointestinal effects have been delineated. for this purpose, apomorphine has
been used as a tool to investigate the presence of da receptors since it displays
structural, biochemical and pharmacological similarities with da [17-20], and
several agonists and antagonists with a high degree of selectivity for d, and d,
receptors are now available (for references, see andersen ef al. [15]). in addition,
specific dopamine d, agonist  xxxd2097xxx  and d, agonist bromocriptine were also
used to confirm the presence of dopamine receptors.

to our knowledge, most of the studies concerning da receptor-mediated
effects in the rat gastrointestinal system have been performed in vitro
(4, 13, 14, 16]. therefore, in the present investigation, we set out to investigate the
pharmacological research, vol. 27, no. 4, 1993 337

effects of da and some “selective” da receptor agonists administered by various
toutes, or gastrointestinal transit in conscious rats, in an attempt to characterize by
pharmacological means the receptors involved in these responses, using
antagonists for either da receptors or receptors other than da. preliminary results
of this investigation have been published as a short note [21].

materials and methods

general

wistar rats of either sex (250-350) were fasted for 24h prior to the
experiment, with free access to water. intestinal transit was evaluated giving a
charcoal meal (2-3 ml/rat) by gastric gavage [22, 23]. twenty minutes after giving
the charcoal meal the rats were killed by cervical dislocation, and the small
intestine from pyloric to iliocecal junction was removed and measured. the
distance travelled by charcoal from the pyloric end was determined and expressed
as percentage of the total distance from pyloric to iliocecal junction.

drug administration

for administration of drugs into the subarachnoid space in the spinal cord, a
polyethylene catheter was implanted through the cisterna magna caudally and the
catheter was pushed up to the lumbar region according to the method of yaksh and
rudy [26]. further individual rats were kept apart in single cages and allowed to
recover for 5 days before they were used.

for intracisternal administration of drugs the head of the rat was flexed at 45° to
the line of back and the drug was administered into the cisterna magna by a needle
of 26 gauge (terumo europe n.v., belgium). this is a modified form of the
method used in mice by vogelweid and kier [25].

due to day to day variation in gastrointestinal transit, saline controls were
always performed on the day of the experiment. for the analysis of the responses
to subcutaneous (s.c.) administration, apomorphine was given in doses of 3, 5 and
10 mg/kg (n=5 each). this procedure was repeated 10 min after s.c. administration
of smg/kg of either sch 23390,  xxxd115xxx ,  xxxd1927xxx ,  xxxd2914xxx  and
propranolol (1 mg/kg). 6-hydroxydopamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in
the rat and 18 h were allowed before it was challenged with apomorphine (3, 5 and
10 mg/kg, i-p.). furthermore, the effects induced by the d, agonist  xxxd2097xxx  (5,
10 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.) and d, receptor agonist bromocriptine (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg,
s.c.) and quinpirole (4 and 8 mg/kg, s.c; or 8 mg/kg, i.p.; or 200 yg, i.t.; n=5 each)
were analysed. after prior administration of sch 23390 (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and
 xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.) in animals, they were challenged with  xxxd2097xxx  (5,
10 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.) and bromocriptine (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) and
subsequently quinpirole (4 and 8 mg/kg, s.c.) was also given to animals pretreated
with  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.; 10min before quinpirole). in addition,
quinpirole (200 jg) and saline were given intrathecally.

for the analysis of the responses to intrathecal (i.t.) administration, three doses
of apomorphine (10, 30 and 100 ug total dose, n=5 each), and one dose of da
(200 yg; total dose, n=5) were given. this procedure was repeated in additional
338 pharmacological research, vol. 27, no. 4, 1993

groups of animals pre-treated with  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.) or sch 23390
(5 mg/kg, s.c), respectively. two control groups (one for apomorphine and another
for da; n=5 each) were given 10 ul of physiological saline (total dose; i.t.).

for the analysis of the responses to intracisternal (i.c.) administration, two
doses of apomorphine (12 and 50 yg; total dose, n=5 each), and three doses of da
(50, 100 and 200 yg; total dose, n=5 each) were given. this procedure was
repeated in additional groups of animals pre-treated with haloperidol (10 yg; i.c.,
total dose). two control groups (n=5 each) were given 10 wl of physiological
saline (total dose; i.c.).

lastly, in two groups of animals, bilateral vagotomy at the cervical level was
performed, and the responses induced by saline (1 ml/kg, s.c.) or apomorphine
(5 mg/kg, s.c.) on gastrointestinal transit were analysed.

data presentation and statistical evaluation

all data in the text, tables and illustrations are presented as meants.e.m. the
significance of the differences between the variables at the saline-, agonist- and
antagonist-treated groups were compared with those in the untreated control group
using the duncan’s new multiple range test, once an analysis of variance
(randomized block design) revealed that the samples represented different
populations [26]. statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05 (two tailed).

compounds

the following drugs were used:  xxxd1927xxx  and haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx 
(janssen pharmaceutica; beerse, belgium); bromocriptine (sandoz; basel,
switzerland); sch 23390  (chlorotetrahydro-methyl-phenyl-benzazepine;
schering corporation; kalamazoo, michigan, usa); naloxone hydrochloride
(dupont; ’s-hertogenbosch, the netherlands), apomorphine and dopamine
hydrochloride (pharmacy, erasmus university, rotterdam, the netherlands);
 xxxd115xxx  chloride (pharmaexport; haarlem, the netherlands); quinpirole
hydrochloride (lilly; indianapolis, indiana, usa), and 6-hydroxydopamine
hydrochloride (sigma chemicals, st. louis, missouri, usa),  xxxd2097xxx 
hydrochloride (smith and kline, philadelphia, usa),  xxxd2914xxx  methane
sulphate (ciba-geigy, arnhem, the netherlands), propranolol hydrochloride (ici,
rotterdam, the netherlands). except for  xxxd1927xxx  (dissolved in a few drops
of dimethyl-sulphoxide) all drugs were dissolved in physiological saline and
subjected to ultrasonication. the vehicles had no effect on gastrointestinal transit
(data not shown).

results

effects of da and apomorphine given by several routes on the rat
gastrointestinal transit

table i shows the effects produced by da and apomorphine administered by
different routes on rat gastrointestinal transit. da produced significant decreases
in gastrointestinal transit (in comparison with the control group) when given i.t.
(200 4g, total dose) or ic. (50, 100 and 200 yg, total dose). apomorphine
pharmacological research, vol. 27, no. 4, 1993 339

mimicked the aforementioned effects of da, eliciting dose-dependent decreases in
gastrointestinal transit when given s.c. (3, 5 and 10 mg/kg), i-t. (10, 30 and 100 yg;
total dose) or i.c. (12 and 50 yg; total dose).

23390 (5 mg/kg; s.c.) did not significantly modify the decreases in gastrointestinal
transit induced by da (200 yg, i.t.) or apomorphine (3, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.).
likewise, intracisternal administration of the classical da receptor antagonist
haloperidol (10 zg) completely blocked the decreases in gastrointestinal transit
induced by da (100 yg, i.c.) and apomorphine (50 yg, i.c.); however, the response
induced by 200 yg of da (i.c.) was not modified by the same dose of haloperidol
when compared to the control group.

interestingly, the d, receptor antagonist  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.) did
significantly antagonize the decreases in gastrointestinal transit induced by
apomorphine (3, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) when compared to the control group;
however, the antitransit effect induced by apomorphine (100 wg, i.t.) was
apparently blunted when compared to the control group (table i). in the same
connection, pretreatment with another d, receptor antagonist,  xxxd115xxx  (5 mg/kg,
s.c.), similarly antagonized the decreases in gastrointestinal transit induced by the
above doses of apomorphine. the values of gastrointestinal transit (%)
corresponding to s.c. administration of physiological saline (1 ml/kg; 63.942.0) or
apomorphine (3, 5 and 10 mg/kg; 41.64+4.6*, 28.346.9* and 30.7+41.9*,
respectively) were significantly different (p<0.05) from those after pretreatment
with  xxxd115xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.) [control 53.5£1.5; after  xxxd115xxx  and apomorphine
g3, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.): 58.042.0, 53.141.5 and 43.943.9, respectively].

figure 1 shows that pretreatment with the a-adrenoceptor blocker  xxxd2914xxx 
(5 mg/kg, s.c.) or the f-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, s.c.)
completely antagonized the antitransit effect of apomorphine. in contrast,
pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) did not modify the
responses to apomorphine.

the antitransit effect of  xxxd2097xxx  and bromocriptine is shown in fig. 2 before

attenuate the  xxxd2097xxx -induced antitransit effect.

on the other hand,  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.) did not antagonize the

discussion

general

several lines of evidence support the existence of at least two types of da
receptors, namely d, and d, [4, 15, 20, 27], and some nomenclature proposals
suggest that da, and da) receptors in the periphery have, respectively,
biochemical properties similar with d, and d, receptors in the cns [4, 28]. thus,
in the present manuscript we have used the d,/d, nomenclature. interestingly, a d3
receptor in the cns has recently been cloned [29].

effect of da, apomorphine and quinpriole on the rat gastrointestinal transit

da does not cross the blood brain barrier; for this reason, the catecholamine
was given directly into the brain (i.c) and spinal cord (i.t.). thus, centrally
administered da elicited a decrease in gastrointestinal transit. this effect of da
was mimicked by apomorphine when given centrally (i.t. and i.c.) or peripherally
(s.c.) (see table i). several functional studies indicate that apomorphine is a
potent agonist at d, receptors; nonetheless, the drug can also interact, though
much less potently, with d, receptors [4, 30]. from these results it is tempting to
suggest that both central and/or peripheral d, receptors may play a role in both
da- and apomorphine-induced decrease in gastrointestinal transit. however, the
d, receptor agonist, quinpirole [31,37], did similarly decrease gastrointestinal
transit when given by s.c. or ip. or it. routes. hence, it can be assumed that d,
(and probably also d; receptors) could be involved in the antitransit effects of da,
apomorphine and quinpirole, since the k; (nm) values for d, and d, receptors are
47433 and 2543 (da); 2442 and 2043 (apomorphine) and 576447 and 5.140.3
(quinpirole), respectively [29].

effect of d, and d, receptor antagonists on da-, apomorphine- and/or
quinpirole-induced decrease in gastrointestinal transit

the present results demonstrate that the d; receptor antagonists,  xxxd1927xxx 
and  xxxd115xxx  [15, 31, 38], but not the d, receptor antagonist sch 23390 [37, 38],
antagonized the decreases in gastrointestinal transit induced by da and/or
apomorphine administered by several routes (see table i and results), supporting
the view that d, receptors may be involved in the antitransit effect induced by da
and apomorphine. it is interesting to note that the responses to subcutaneous
apomorphine were more potently antagonized by  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.) than
the responses to intrathecal apomorphine. a possible explanation for this finding
could be that  xxxd1927xxx , which was administered only subcutaneously, is a
specific d, receptor antagonist devoid of important central activity [32]. however,
the central d, receptor antagonist  xxxd115xxx , which is very effective against
apomorphine-induced emesis [34], did antagonize the decreases in gastrointestinal
transit induced by subcutaneous apomorphine as  xxxd1927xxx  did, these results
are in close agreement with those reported by wolverton ef al. [38], where
apomorphine-induced discriminative stimulus in rhesus monkeys was antagonized
by central d, receptor antagonists, but not by sch 23390 (d,-antagonist).

clearly, the involvement of central d, receptors in the antitransit effect induced
by central administration of da and apomorphine is substantiated by the finding
344 pharmacological research, vol. 27, no. 4, 1993

that the classical da receptor antagonist, haloperidol (10 wg, i.c; [20]), potently
blocked these responses (table i); haloperidol is a much more potent antagonist at
d, than d, receptors [15, 35]. however, the discrepancy that the antitransit effect
produced by da (200 ug, i.c.) was not antagonized by haloperidol (10 yg, i.c;
table 1) could be most likely explained by the fact that the dose of da used was
high enough to overcome the blockade induced by haloperidol (10 yg, i.c.). lastly,
it should be noticed that the d, receptor agonist quinpirole [33, 39], displaying k,
values (nm) of 576447 and 5.1+0.3 for d, and d; receptors, respectively [31], did
mimic da eliciting significant reductions in gastrointestinal transit (table ii)
which, however, were not antagonized by  xxxd1927xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.); thus, the
possible involvement of d, receptors in the responses to quinpirole in this
preparation is questionable. the present findings seem to rule out a possible
interaction of quinpirole with  xxxd1927xxx -sensitive d, receptors, which conflicts
with its well established d. agonist properties [20]. two plausible explanations for
this apparent discrepancy can be offered. firstly, it is likely that the decrease in
gastrointestinal transit induced by da receptor agonists could be mediated by two
different subtypes of the d, receptor, as previously suggested by sibley (33]; thus,
one subtype could be sensitive to da receptor antagonists (e.g.  xxxd1927xxx ), but
insensitive to da receptor agonists (e.g. quinpirole) whereas the other subtype
could be insensitive to  xxxd1927xxx , but sensitive to quinpirole. the second
possibility is that a novel da receptor, perhaps d; [29, 33] could be involved;
indeed, this contention if further substantiated by the k; (nm) values of quinpirole
and  xxxd1927xxx  for d; and d; receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary
cells: 576447 and 5.1£0.3 (quinpirole) and 0.3040:03 and 9.5+0.5 ( xxxd1927xxx )
for d, and d, receptors, respectively [29]. admittedly, the recent publication [39]
proposed a specific antagonist for d; agonist quinpirole which in future will shed
more light on the role of a d; receptor in intestinal transit.

effect of d,-agonist  xxxd2097xxx  and d,-agonist bromocriptone on
gastrointestinal transit

the present results show that the d,-receptor antagonist sch 23390 [37]
antagonized the antitransit effect of the lowest dose of  xxxd2097xxx  (5 mg/kg, s.c.).
since sch 23390 (5 mg/kg, s.c.) had no effect on intestinal transit (control 59.39+
2.84, sch 23390: 52.9142.10) nor did it potentiate the antitransit effect of
 xxxd2097xxx , it may be possible that antitransit effect of higher doses of
 xxxd2097xxx  may be through other mechanisms (inhibition of sympathetic system
or a direct effect on smooth muscle of intestine). hence further work is needed to
understand the antitransit effect of  xxxd2097xxx . thus it is apparent that dopamine
d, receptor blockade by sch 23390 is surmountable by higher doses of
 xxxd2097xxx  but still the results indicate that there is a partial blockade induced by
sch 23390. however,  xxxd1927xxx  did not attenuate the antitransit effect of
 xxxd2097xxx , thus showing that the antitransit effect of  xxxd2097xxx  is through a
specific dopamine d,-receptor.

on the other hand,  xxxd1927xxx  antagonized the bromocriptine-induced
decrease in gastrointestinal transit. thus it is conceivable from these studies that a
dopamine receptor (d,) is involved in the intestinal transit.

effect of chemical sympathectomy (6-hydroxydopamine) and adrenergic blockers
on the decrease in gastrointestinal transit induced by apomorphine

despite the availability of selective da receptor agonists and antagonists,
evidence for the presence of da receptors in the gastointestinal tract is limited,
depending on the species, autonomic influences, the segment of the
gastrointestinal system under study and/or adrenergic receptors may be involved
in the inhibitory effects of da on gastrointestinal motility [4, 13,14]. 6-
hydroxydopamine produces chemical sympathectomy [40]. in the present study,
6-ohda (100 mg/kg, i.p.) did not modify baseline gastrointestinal transit,
suggesting that in spite of chemical sympathectomy, circulating catecholamine can
still interact with the gastrointestinal system. in addition, apomorphine-induced
antitransit effect was not modified after chemical sympathectomy, implying that
this reponse is not due to the indirect release of sympathetic neurotransmitters.

on the other hand, pretreatment with adrenoceptor blockers  xxxd2914xxx 
(5 mg/kg, s.c.) and propranolol (1 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the
antitransit effect of apomorphine. thus the present results show that in addition to
dopamine receptors there are also @ and f-adrenoceptors involved in the intestinal
transit. interestingly, it is known that intestinal adrenergic mechanisms are known
to play an inhibitory role in intestinal motility [4, 13, 14, 40].

effect of vagotomy on baseline gastrointestinal transit and on apomorphine-
induced decrease in gastrointestinal transit

our findings, showing that after bilateral cervical vagotomy the baseline
gastrointestinal transit was markedly decreased, confirm and extend previous
studies [1,2] demonstrating that parasympathetic tone exerts an excitatory
stimulus on the gastrointestinal system. in addition, since apomorphine (5 mg/kg,
s.c.) produced a further decrease in gastrointestinal transit after vagotomy (table
iii), it is reasonable to assume that apomorphine exerts a direct effect on d,
receptors in the gastrointestinal system; nevertheless, additional studies are
necessary to substantiate this assumption.

in conclusion, the present study provides evidence that the decrease in
gastrointestinal transit elicited by da, bromocriptine and apomorphine is
primarily through d, receptors and d, receptors through  xxxd2097xxx  respectively.
in addition to dopamine receptors @ and f-adrenoceptors are also involved in
intestinal propulsion of gastrointestinal contents.
