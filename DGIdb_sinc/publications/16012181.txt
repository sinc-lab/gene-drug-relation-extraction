introduction
aberrant signalling through the  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) is associated with neoplastic cell proliferation, migration, stromal invasion, resistance to apoptosis and
angiogenesis [1]. the high frequency of abnormalities in
egfr signalling in human carcinomas and preclinical studies
showing that inhibition of egfr can impair tumour growth,
have made egfr an attractive target for the development of
cancer therapeutics [1]. among the classes of agents targeting
egfr in clinical development are monoclonal antibodies
against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor
and small molecules that inhibit activation of the receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  [1]. several of these molecules are under
development in colorectal cancer (crc) [2 –7].
the chimeric antibody cetuximab has been investigated
alone and in combination with irinotecan in patients with
refractory metastatic colorectal cancer and has shown a
consistent activity in egfr-expressing chemotherapy-refractory crc [2]. in the pivotal bond study, the combination of

cetuximab plus irinotecan led to a response rate of 23% in
patients with irinotecan refractory egfr-positive metastatic
crc and to a tumour stabilisation in 33% of patients. the
response rate after cetuximab alone in this trial was 11% [2].
in this and other studies, no correlation was found between
the strength of the egfr expression as determined by
immune-histochemistry and response rate [2, 8]. therefore
more tools are needed to define tumours in which egfr
inhibitors are really active.
 xxxd2838xxx  ( xxxd2838xxx ) is a fully human monoclonal
antibody that inhibits the egfr. as monotherapy, a response
rate of 11% has been found in chemorefractory crc [4]. the
humanised monoclonal antibody matuzumab (emd72000) is
in early phase 2 development in different tumour types [5].
the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors gefitinib,  xxxd2029xxx  and
 xxxd2866xxx  have been studied less extensively in crc, but
seem to be less active in crc [6, 7].
egfr inhibitors are generally well tolerated and do not
have the severe systemic side-effects usually seen with cytotoxic drugs. however, they often cause signs of skin toxicity,
most often an acneiform eruption [2–10]. a correlation has
been suggested between the acneiform eruption and egfr
inhibitor antitumour activity [2, 3, 10]. prospective studies
including skin and tumour biopsies are, however, needed to
clarify and explain this possible relationship.

the last few years, new therapies targeting the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) have
shown their efficacy in the treatment of several types of cancer. monoclonal antibodies against the
egfr (e.g. cetuximab,  xxxd2838xxx ) or egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib,  xxxd2029xxx )
are generally well tolerated and do not have the severe systemic side-effects usually seen with cytotoxic drugs. a considerable number of patients treated with these egfr inhibitors, however,
develop dermatological side-effects, most frequently an acneiform eruption but also xerosis, eczema,
fissures, telangiectasia, hyperpigmentation, hair changes and paronychia with pyogenic granuloma.
these skin effects appear to be mechanism-based linked to the inhibition of egfr action but the
exact pathophysiology remains elusive. left untreated these dermatological side-effects could represent a threat to patient compliance. therefore effective management is mandatory. mild cases of
acneiform eruption respond well to topical anti-inflammatory acne therapy, whereas tetracyclines are
needed to treat moderate to severe cases. this review outlines the broad spectrum of cutaneous sideeffects of egfr inhibitors, discusses possible underlying mechanisms and provides practical guidelines for the management based on literature data and on personal experience.

xerosis and related changes
patients receiving egfr inhibitors can gradually develop a dry
skin over weeks resembling the xerosis in atopic eczema [21,
25, 27]. patient’s old age, previous therapy with cytotoxics and
history of atopic eczema will accentuate the cutaneous dryness,

the most frequently reported side-effect of egfr inhibitors
(both monoclonal antibodies and  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors) is
an acneiform eruption [2 –17]. the rash seems to be dosedependent [4, 11, 12, 14, 17] and is seen in more than 50% up
to 100% of patients (table 1). further studies are ongoing to
understand this dose relationship better.
in clinical studies, the acneiform eruption caused by egfr
inhibitors is usually classified according to the national
cancer institute common toxicity criteria version 2.0
(nci ctc v2.0) [2, 3, 5, 12, 14, 15, 18] (table 2) or the more
recent national cancer institute common terminology
criteria for adverse events version 3.0 (nci ctcae v3.0)
[19]. only a small portion (most often less than 5% up to
18%) of the patients experience a grade 3 reaction (table 1).
however, these criteria exhibit some shortcomings that do not
always allow accurate classification of the skin rash [9]. in
this respect, version 2 attaches great value to body surface
involvement which is, however, very difficult to score in a follicular eruption. version 3 introduces a special category on
acneiform eruption that is at the same time very pragmatic
and highly susceptible to interpretation (table 2).
the eruption is more or less confined to the seborrheic
areas (rich in sebaceous glands): the face, the neck and retroauricular area, the shoulders, the upper trunk (v-shaped)
(figure 1a, b) and the scalp. sometimes the lower parts of
the back, the abdomen, the buttocks and even the arms and
legs can be involved as well, whereas the palms and soles are

spared [20–27]. the eruption is similar in patients receiving
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies but tends
to be more severe and widespread with the latter [26].
the skin lesions consist of sometimes itchy erythematous
follicular papules (figure 1a) that may evolve into pustules
[20–27] (figure 1b, c). the pustules may confluate to lakes
of pus that dry out with the formation of yellow crusts (figure
1d) [26]. sometimes the facial lesions consist of diffuse
erythema with follicular papulopustules and telangiectasia
resembling rosacea. in other cases a seborrheic dermatitis-like
picture is seen on the face [25] when the pustules leave an
erythema covered with small greasy squames. rarely the rash
presents with an oedematous, warm erythema of the face
mimicking an erysipelas. very rarely the cutaneous inflammation is so pronounced that skin necrosis with black eschar
formation and ulceration is seen. the follicular skin lesions
are not preceded by visible comedones (blackheads or whiteheads) and can therefore not be considered as a true acne [23,
24, 27, 28]. in contrast to acneiform eruptions caused by other
drugs [28],  xxxd1256xxx -induced skin lesions may be
accompanied by pruritus.
the acneiform eruption arises a few days after treatment
with the  xxxd1256xxx , to reach a maximum after 2 [9] to
3 weeks [2] following commencement of the therapy. more
rarely (11%) the rash occurs in a delayed fashion after the first
3 weeks of treatment (with cetuximab) [2]. some spontaneous
improvement can be seen even when treatment is continued [9].
however, a flare-up of the rash can occur following each infusion of further treatment [23]. the eruption disappears in a few
weeks time when treatment is discontinued leaving sometimes
residual hyperpigmentation and xerosis [21]. no relationship
has yet been observed between the appearance or severity of
the rash and a history of oily skin, acne [20] or rosacea.
microscopic evaluation of the skin lesions shows a picture
of a neutrophilic folliculitis and perifolliculitis [20, 21, 23,
26]. an early infiltration with t-lymphocytes is followed by a
hyperkeratotic, ectatic appearance of the follicular infundibula
and a florid, neutrophilic suppurative infiltrate [20]. intraepidermal acantholysis is sometimes present but the significance of this finding is unknown [20]. in contrast to true acne,
no clear formation of comedones is seen [28], although the
absence of early biopsy specimens cannot exclude the formation of a microcomedo as the trigger of inflammation. the
pustules are notably sterile with negative cultures or stainings
for bacteria, fungi, yeasts (including malassezia furfur) or
demodex mites [23, 24] but no quantitative or longitudinal
microbiological investigations have been carried out yet.
the (pre-existing?) presence of propionibacterium acnes or
malassezia furfur could only be demonstrated in a few exceptional cases [20, 21, 24].

patients receiving egfr inhibitors [21]. sometimes involvement of the mucosae can be seen with vaginal dryness [27] or
aphtous ulcers of the oral or nasal mucosa [20, 25].

nail changes
nail changes are seen in 10%– 15% of patients and are a late
event (starting usually not earlier than 4–8 weeks) during the
treatment course [25]. paronychia manifesting with inflammation of the nail fold (mainly of the great toe; other toes and
fingers may be involved as well) is usually the first sign [20].
this paronychia can be very painful and mimics an ingrown
toenail in the severe cases where pyogenic granuloma of
the nail fold develops [25, 29 –32] (figure 3). secondary

which manifests with dry, scaly, itchy skin especially of the
limbs and of skin areas that were affected by acneiform eruption [21]. the xerosis may develop into chronic asteatotic
eczema. when secondary infection of the xerotic skin with
staphylococcus aureus occurs, a flare-up of acute oozing dermatitis and sometimes yellow crusting may be seen. rarely the
compromised epidermal barrier in these patients is the portal of
entry for secondary infection with herpes simplex virus, manifesting with a monomorphous picture with numerous tiny
vesicles. the fingertops and toes may develop a dry pulpitis
with dry scaly eczema. painful fissures may arise on the fingers
and toes, mainly at the tops, in the nail folds and over the interphalangeal joints [20, 27] (figure 2). along with the xerosis,
increased skin fragility and easy bruising are observed in

telangiectasia

infection with staphylococcus aureus is not uncommon [30,
32] and painful fissures sometimes arise in the nail folds [27].
the nails tend to grow more slowly; they are more brittle and
sometimes crack [27].

hair changes
during prolonged treatment with egfr inhibitors, changes of
the hairs can be noticed. very characteristic are the long,
curly, rigid eyelashes, also named trichomegaly [33, 34]
(figure 4). the eyebrows become thicker and more rigid as
well [34] whereas the scalp hairs grow more slowly and adopt
a finer, more brittle and curly aspect [21]. in addition less
shavings of the beard are required. mild hair loss can be seen
on the scalp, arms or legs, whereas hypertrichosis with small
vellus hairs may develop on the face and the female lip.

hyperpigmentation
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation [32] is typically seen
following acneiform eruption (figure 6) or other causes of
skin inflammation such as eczema or an inflamed sebaceous
cyst. sun exposure aggravates the hyperpigmentation.

pathophysiology
several factors plead in favour of a mechanism-based sideeffect that is directly linked to specific inhibition of the egfr.
first, similar cutaneous effects develop regardless of the mechanism of action of the  xxxd1256xxx  as a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab,  xxxd2838xxx , matuzumab) [2– 5, 17] or as
an egfr-specific  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (gefitinib,  xxxd2029xxx )
[12, 14, 15, 18]. moreover, acneiform eruption or nail changes
are not seen with inhibitors of other egfr family members
such as trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against her2

early during the development of acneiform eruption or with
subsequent flares of the rash, scattered telangiectasia (figure 5)
may appear on the face, on and behind the ears, on the chest,
back and limbs, usually in the vicinity of a follicular pustule.
unlike other telangiectasia, the lesions tend to fade over
months usually leaving some hyperpigmentation.

receptor [35]. secondly, the cutaneous effects appear to be
dose-dependent as shown for gefitinib [12, 14] and  xxxd2838xxx  ( xxxd2838xxx ) [4, 17]. thirdly, there is growing evidence
for a possible correlation between tumour response and the presence or extent of skin rash as demonstrated with cetuximab
[2, 3, 10, 36],  xxxd2838xxx  [17],  xxxd2029xxx  [15, 18, 37] and
gefitinib [8, 38]. hence there is an ongoing discussion about
the use of skin side-effects as a surrogate marker for pharmacodynamic effects of egfr inhibitors [39] and about (‘dose-torash’) strategies to titrate the  xxxd1256xxx  dose in individual
patients to a level that causes detectable skin rash. a randomised study is ongoing in which patients with no rash or rash
grade 1 are randomised between an increasing dose of cetuximab plus irinotecan or the recommended dose of cetuximab
plus irinotecan (everest study). in this study, skin and
tumour biopsies are taken before and during treatment to understand better the mechanism of this  xxxd1256xxx -induced
rash. very recently, a polymorphism in the intron 1 of the
egfr gene that affects transcription efficiency of the gene,
was found to correlate with both tumour response and skin toxicity [40]. fourthly, egfr-null skin of genetically engineered
mice is very dry, flaky and covered with a thin epidermis [41].
moreover, extensive hair follicle defects result not only in thin
and brittle hair but also in a mixed inflammatory infiltration at
the hair follicle with rupture of the follicular epithelium [42],
findings that are strikingly similar to the skin changes induced
by egfr inhibitors.
in the spectrum of drug-induced skin changes, the combination of the itchy acneiform eruption, xerosis, paronychia,
hair changes and telangiectasia is entirely unique. classical
inducers of acneiform eruption are corticosteroids,  xxxd2716xxx 
and antiepileptics, but this rash usually does not itch and is
not accompanied by the other skin findings elicited by
egfr inhibitors [28]. oral retinoids may induce xerosis and
paronychia but not acneiform changes [43]. the only common
finding in the kaleidoscope of dermatologic effects induced by

egfr inhibitors is that they occur in sites where egfr is
known to be expressed, namely the basal epidermal cells,
sebaceous glands, hair follicle outer root sheath and hair shaft
and the capillary system [44].
the mechanism by which inhibition of egfr leads to
acneiform eruption and the other dermatologic symptoms is
largely unknown. egfr activation serves essential functions
in the skin such as the promotion of keratinocyte proliferation, survival and motility and the regulation of differentiation and keratinisation [45]. hence egfr occupies a
central role in carcinogenesis, psoriasis and wound healing
[45]. wound healing problems are, however, not seen with
egfr inhibitors. numerous pharmacodynamic studies have
confirmed molecular effects in the skin of patients treated
with different egfr inhibitors. not unexpectedly, a dramatic decrease of the phosphorylation status of the egfr in
the epidermis and in the percentage of activated mapkpositive epidermal cells was noticed in gefitinib-treated
patients [12] together with thinning of the corneal layers,
decreased labelling of cells with the proliferation marker
ki67 and increased numbers of cells that are immunohistochemically positive for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p27, a marker for growth arrest [46]. epidermal p27 upregulation was also seen in cetuximab-treated patients [20]
as well as decreased thickness of stratum corneum and
decreased ki67 labelling following  xxxd2029xxx  therapy [16].
the keratinocyte growth arrest and thinning of the corneal
layers is in line with egfr’s role in maintaining keratinocyte proliferation [45] and in promoting late terminal differentiation [47] but is hard to explain the acneiform aspect of
the eruption (a follicular papulopustular eruption mostly
confined to the seborrheic areas) observed in the majority
of patients receiving egfr inhibitors. the expression of
egfr in the pilosebaceous unit, both in follicular keratinocytes and in sebocytes [44], is likely to play an, as yet, unidentified but major role in the follicular localisation of the
eruption in regions rich in sebaceous glands. similar folliculitis changes in the skin of egfr knockout mice confirm
the importance of egfr in the hair follicle (or pilosebaceous unit) [42].
the study of the pathophysiology of acne or acneiform
eruptions is considerably hampered by the lack of reliable
animal models [28]. in an in vitro acne model system, egf
was recently demonstrated to facilitate the development of
acne by causing disorganisation of infundibular keratinocytes
enhancing the entry of inflammatory sebum into the dermis
[48]. these results sharply contrast with the acneiform eruption in patients on egfr inhibitors. this discrepancy may be
explained by the limitations of the in vitro model or by the
fact that both egfr overstimulation and inhibition lead to disorganisation of the pilosebaceous unit leading to follicular
inflammation. in addition, it should be stressed that no blackheads or whiteheads precede the follicular papules or pustules
of an acneiform eruption, unlike acne, which typically starts
with the formation of comedones by follicular hypercornification due to seborrhoea [28].

management
dermatological side-effects of egfr inhibitors should be
taken seriously since they can cause not only itch (acneiform
eruption, xerosis, eczema) and pain (paronychia) but also cosmetic discomfort that may compromise compliance to therapy
if left untreated. therefore, it is important to inform patients
about the possible side-effects, to provide preventive measures
to minimise side-effects and to treat the skin symptoms when
needed. treatment is best individualised according to the type

and the extent of the skin lesions. in this respect, choice of the
right vehicle and frequent follow-ups to re-evaluate the skin
lesions are important. a multidisciplinary approach with a dermatologist is advisable especially in the more severe cases.
publications on the management of skin toxicity of egfr
inhibitors are still very scarce [27, 59 –61]. here, we provide
some practical guidelines based mainly on personal experience.

general measures
to ensure a maximal hydration of the skin, the use of bath oil
or shower oil (instead of shower gel or soap) and of tepid
water to wash should be encouraged. to prevent xerosis, an
emollient cream (especially on the limbs) can be used. sun
exposure should be avoided and/or effective sun barrier preparations should be used to minimise the risk of
hyperpigmentation.

acneiform eruption
for mild grade 1 reactions, no treatment or treatment with
topical  xxxd3159xxx  or anti-rosacea agents with anti-inflammatory
properties can be started (e.g. metronidazole gel or cream, erythromycin or clindamycin gel or lotion, benzoylperoxide gel
or cream on the face or  xxxd3159xxx  in alcoholic lotion on
chest/back). one should bear in mind that this topical treatment has drying properties and may aggravate xerosis. when
the acneiform eruption is fading or becoming scaly, one
should switch topical treatment to cream bases instead of alcoholic lotions or gels.
in patients treated with  xxxd2029xxx , no effect was seen with
topical retinoids, vitamin d analogues or steroids [9]. except
in the presence of eczema (see below), the use of topical or
systemic steroids should be avoided since they are well known
to induce or aggravate acne, acneiform eruption, rosacea or
telangiectasia [28]. moreover systemic steroids may interfere
with the antibody-dependent cytotoxic action of egfr antibodies. although anticomedonal topicals such as retinoids
(tretinoin) or a-hydroxyacids have been advocated in some
reports [21, 61], we would not recommend them because of
the lack of comedones [27] and the possible aggravation of
xerosis and eczema [21].
for grade 2 reactions, topical treatment as for grade 1 can
be used together with topical menthol cream or an oral antihistamine (cetirizine, loratadine, hydroxyzine) when itch is
present and an oral tetracycline (minocycline 100 mg/day,
lymecycline 300 mg/day or doxycycline 100 mg/day) [21, 23].
thanks to their anti-inflammatory properties, tetracyclines
exert marked  xxxd3159xxx  effects, when given in a course of at
least 3 months [28]. oral isotretinoin is not recommended
because of its overlapping side-effect profile (xerosis,
paronychia) [43] and its unknown interaction with the antitumoural properties of egfr inhibitors.
in the case of grade 3 reactions, delay of therapy with
egfr inhibitors should be taken into consideration. in
addition to the aforementioned topicals, compresses with
physiologic solution can be applied in the case of acute

until now, most of the considerations about the mechanisms
behind  xxxd1256xxx -induced acneiform eruption imply
effects on (follicular) keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation that cause secondary inflammation. however, egfr
targeted therapies may affect the immune system more
directly as well, by unblocking cutaneous chemokine production resulting in leukocyte chemotaxis and infiltration in
the skin based on a recent study attributing a role to cutaneous
egfr in the suppression of chemokine production [49].
the  xxxd1256xxx -induced xerosis can be explained more
easily by the established role of egfr in the maintenance of
the integrity of the epidermal permeability barrier [50],
whereas the skin fragility and epidermal thinning refer to the
involvement of egfr in keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and survival [45]. moreover dryness and fragility of
the skin can be reproduced in egfr knockout mice [41].
the hair changes reflect the role of egfr and its ligands in
hair follicle biology and hair cycling. similar hair changes can
be seen in transgenic mice or spontaneous mutants affecting
egfr, its ligands or its partner receptors [42, 51 –53], including long and curly whiskers corresponding to the trichomegaly
in patients on egfr inhibitors [33, 34].
paronychia and pyogenic granuloma of the nail fold
resemble the side-effects of systemic retinoids [43]. retinoids
are also well known to cause xerosis but no acneiform eruption, telangiectasia or hyperpigmentation [43]. this partly
overlapping side-effect profile may be due to the downregulating effects of retinoids on the egfr system [54] or alternatively to the similar effects of retinoids and egfr inhibitors
on epidermal proliferation and differentiation [43, 45]. xerosis
and desquamation of nail fold and nail bed epidermis may
cause epidermal squames to be stuck between the nail plate
and the surrounding epidermis inducing chronic irritation and
inflammation [55]. the development of pyogenic granuloma
may reflect effects on angiogenic factors such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf) that are overexpressed in
these lesions [56]. the effects of retinoids on vegf
expression in vitro are known to depend on culture conditions
displaying inhibition as well as stimulation [57]. egfr inhibitors have been demonstrated to inhibit vegf expression and
angiogenesis [58] but it is unknown whether these drugs could
also induce vegf in some tissues (skin) under certain circumstances. moreover, the very peculiar development of telangiectasia could also be linked to disturbances in the
production of angiogenic factors.

1431
inflammation. oral anti-histamines and oral tetracyclines
at high (maximal anti-inflammatory) doses (minocycline
2100 mg/day, lymecycline 2300 mg/day or doxycycline
2100 mg/day) complete the treatment. the dose can be
tapered as soon as the acute inflammation has faded.
grade 4 reactions, although extremely seldom, should be
treated in specialised burn care units and egfr inhibitors
should be immediately stopped for good.

xerosis

paronychia
as a preventive measure, it is important to avoid friction and
pressure on the nail fold by wearing shoes that are not too
tight. the paronychia caused by egfr blockers are not infective in nature but render the nail folds very sensitive to infection [30, 32]. topical antiseptics or antibiotics (soaks and/or
creams) should, therefore, be used on a regular basis. in our
hands, a drying paste containing an antiseptic (chlorhexidine),
an anti-yeast (nystatin) and in severe cases a topical corticosteroid [29, 31] has proved helpful in the treatment of paronychia. in case of secondary bacterial infection, oral antibiotics
can be administered according to the antibiogram. although
the nail fold inflammation caused by egfr inhibitors mimics
the clinical picture of an ingrown nail, partial nail bed excision has no effect. total nail extraction with destruction of
nail matrix may help but then the nail is permanently lost
(own experience). silver nitrate application on a weekly basis
will improve pyogenic granuloma.

telangiectasia
telangiectasia caused by treatment with egfr inhibitors,
unlike spontaneous telangiectasia, will gradually disappear

hyperpigmentation
since the excessive pigmentation appears to be mostly postinflammatory in nature, adequate prevention and treatment of
acneiform eruption and eczema is important. another preventive measure is to avoid the unfavourable effect of the sun, by
minimising sun exposure and encouraging the use of sun
blocking creams. bleaching creams are not very helpful; the
hyperpigmentation will fade spontaneously with time
(months).

conclusion
cutaneous effects of egfr inhibitors represent a totally
unique new group of class-specific side-effects consisting
essentially of an itchy acneiform papulopustular eruption, telangiectasia and xerosis. during longer treatment nail fold
inflammation, hair changes and hyperpigmentation may also
arise. these side-effects compare well in their tolerance to
those seen with cytotoxic drugs. the underlying mechanisms
are poorly understood but are most likely linked to inhibition
of egfr in the skin. as there is growing evidence of a
relationship between treatment efficacy and rash, the rash may
serve as a surrogate marker for tumour response. although the
numbers treated are small, in our experience the acneiform
eruption responds well to topical  xxxd3159xxx  therapy and tetracycline antibiotics, whereas emollients are recommended for
the skin xerosis. future clinical research is required to meet
the need for a more accurate classification (in order to better
define the relation between skin effects and tumour response)
and for more evidence-based treatment of skin toxicity.

apart from the general hydrating measures, the right vehicle
choice to treat skin conditions is indispensable to alleviate
skin dryness. in this respect alcoholic lotions or gels should be
discontinued when the first signs of dryness appear and
switched to oil in water creams instead (on face/chest/back).
on the limbs greasy (water in oil) creams or even ointments
can be used for moderate to severe xerosis. the right balance
should, however, always be kept since occlusive ointments
may facilitate the development of folliculitis lesions. when
eczema is present, topical weak corticosteroids are recommended for a short term (1 –2 weeks). when eczema
becomes wet, a swab for bacterial (or viral culture) can be
taken and treatment with topical (fusidic acid) or in severe
cases systemic antibiotics (penicillinase-resistant pennicillins)
can be added. in the rare case of herpes simplex virus superinfection, treatment with systemic antiviral drugs is necessary.
fissures can be treated with propyleneglycol 50% solution
under plastic occlusion,  xxxd3159xxx  10% ointment, a hydrocolloid dressing,  xxxd2139xxx  tape or liquid cyanoacrylate
glue [27].

over months. in selected cases electrocoagulation or pulsed
dye laser therapy can be applied to accelerate disappearance.
