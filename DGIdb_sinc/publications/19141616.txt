gabaergic synapses and are critical for the development and
coordination of neuronal activity underlying the majority of
physiological and behavioral processes in the brain (1–3).
gabaa receptors are assembled from seven classes of homologous subunits, ␣(1– 6), ␤(1–3), ␥(1–3), ␦, ⑀, ␲, and ␪ (4), into
heteropentamers that display extensive structural and functional heterogeneity at different subcellular localizations (5).
thus, gabaa receptors also operate as tonically active extrasynaptic receptors (6 – 8), and as modulatory auto- or heteroreceptors present on axons and, in some instances, presynaptic
nerve terminals in specific areas of the central nervous system
(9, 10).
presynaptic inhibition mediated by gabaa receptors was
first described in the spinal cord (11–15). recent electrophysiological studies have established the presence of presynaptic
gabaa receptors in a number of brain regions, including cerebellum (16 –19), hippocampus (20 –26), auditory brainstem
(27), ventral tegmental area (28), and others (9). however, from
these studies it is apparent that the presynaptic activity of
gabaa receptors can have diverse effects on properties of neurotransmitter release, ranging from inhibition to stimulation of
spontaneous or evoked release of neurotransmitters, depending on a type of nerve terminals, brain region, and/or the age of
animals (9). given that neurotransmitter release results from a
complex cascade of interactions between voltage-gated ion
channels and protein machinery involved in synaptic vesicle
exocytosis, and can be regulated at multiple points in this cascade (29), it is important to establish the exact signaling mechanisms activated downstream of gabaa receptors to regulate
this process.
we demonstrate here that gabaa receptors, by regulating
intraterminal calcium concentration ([ca2⫹]i), increase ca2⫹/
calmodulin-dependent signaling to inhibit subsequent voltagegated ca2⫹ entry and thereby suppress neurotransmitter
release from glutamatergic terminals isolated from the adult rat
neocortex. we demonstrate further that the inhibition of glutamate release requires  xxxg2079xxx  activity, implicating a cl⫺ electrochemical gradient subserving a depolarizing activity of
gabaa receptors in this preparation. moreover, the modulagad,  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase; vglut, vesicular glutamate transporter;  xxxg2079xxx ,  xxxg2078xxx  1; anova, analysis of variance; cdi,

␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) receptors, a family of
clⴚ-permeable ion channels, mediate fast synaptic inhibition as
postsynaptically enriched receptors for ␥- xxxd2177xxx  at
gabaergic synapses. here we describe an alternative type of
inhibition mediated by gabaa receptors present on neocortical
glutamatergic nerve terminals and examine the underlying signaling mechanism(s). by monitoring the activity of the presynaptic cam kinase ii/ xxxg2235xxx  signaling pathway in isolated
nerve terminals, we demonstrate that gabaa receptor activation correlated with an increase in basal intraterminal [ca2ⴙ]i.
interestingly, this activation of gabaa receptors resulted in a
reduction of subsequent depolarization-evoked ca2ⴙ influx,
which thereby led to an inhibition of glutamate release. to
investigate how the observed gabaa receptor-mediated modulation operates, we determined the sensitivity of this process to
the  xxxg2078xxx  1 antagonist bumetanide, as well as
substitution of ca2ⴙ with ba2ⴙ, or ca2ⴙ/calmodulin inhibition
by w7. all of these treatments abolished the modulation by
gabaa receptors. application of selective antagonists of voltage-gated ca2ⴙ channels (vgccs) revealed that the gabaa
receptor-mediated modulation of glutamate release required
the specific activity of l- and r-type vgccs. crucially, the inhibition of release by these receptors was abolished in terminals
isolated from r-type vgcc knock-out mice. together, our
results indicate that a functional coupling between nerve terminal gabaa receptors and l- or r-type vgccs is mediated by
ca2ⴙ/calmodulin-dependent signaling. this mechanism provides a gaba-mediated control of glutamatergic synaptic activity by a direct inhibition of glutamate release.

nerve terminal gabaa receptors regulate glutamate release
tion is dependent on the influx of ca2⫹ via l- or r-type vgccs,
although only r-type channels directly contribute to the
release. the modulatory entry of ca2⫹ leads to the activation of
calmodulin. together, our results demonstrate gabaa receptor-mediated and ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent down-regulation of vgccs leading to an inhibition of glutamate release
from nerve terminals.

experimental procedures
preparation of synaptosomes—percoll gradient-purified synaptosomes were prepared as described previously (30) from the
cerebral cortices of 2-month-old male sprague-dawley rats or
from male wild-type or r-type (cav2.3) ␣1e subunit-deficient
(␣1e⫺/⫺) mutant mice characterized previously (31). on incubation at 37 °c, synaptosomes show metabolic competence and
ability to release neurotransmitters (32, 33).
glutamate release assay—synaptosomes (0.1 mg) were
resuspended in 1.5 ml of hepes-buffered incubation medium
(hbm: 140 mm nacl, 5 mm nahco3, 1 mm mgcl2, 1.2 mm
na2hpo4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm hepes, ph 7.4), and
placed in an ls-5 spectrofluorimeter (perkinelmer life sciences) at 37 °c with stirring. glutamate release was assayed in
the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (50 units/ml, sigma),
nadp⫹ (2 mm), and cacl2 (1 mm) by on-line fluorimetry, as
described previously (32, 34). where indicated, synaptosomes
were incubated in the presence of  xxxd2947xxx  (50 –100 ␮m, tocris), sr 95532 (50 ␮m, tocris), strychnine (30 ␮m, sigma),
bumetanide (10 ␮m, sigma), w7 (20 ␮m, tocris), or w5 (20 ␮m,
tocris) for 10 min; ␻-agatoxin iva (100 ␮m, alomone labs),
␻-conotoxin gvia (10 ␮m, alomone labs), nicl2 (50 ␮m,
sigma), nifedipine (1 ␮m, alomone labs), or  xxxd1315xxx -482 (100 nm,
alomone labs) for 4 min; and muscimol (10 –500 ␮m, tocris)
or isoguvacine (10 –500 ␮m, tocris) for 3 min prior to the addition of secretagogue. other experiments were performed in the
presence of egta (0.2 mm) for 7 min, followed by the addition
of either bacl2 (1 mm) with/without muscimol (200 ␮m) or only
muscimol (200 ␮m), and further incubated for 3 min prior to the
addition of secretagogue. release was stimulated as indicated
with  xxxd1804xxx  (4ap, 1 mm), kcl (10 mm), or  xxxd2379xxx 
(5 ␮m), 10 min after the start of incubation and monitored at 2-s
intervals. data were analyzed using lotus 1-2-3, microcal origin, and microsoft excel. each n indicates the number of individual synaptosome preparations used; each preparation was
derived from a single animal. mean glutamate release ⫾ s.e. in
the absence or presence of drugs is reported in time course
traces. unless otherwise indicated, mean release values ⫾ s.e.
(nmol/mg protein/5 min) quoted in the text are levels attained
at “steady state” 5 min after stimulation. additionally, for some
comparisons, the values obtained in the presence of drugs are
expressed as percent of corresponding control values in the
absence of drugs and shown as bar graphs. statistical analysis
was carried out using one-way anova followed by post-hoc
lsd test. dose-response curves were fit using a sigmoidal relationship with variable slope employing graphpad prism.
intraterminal ca2⫹ measurements—intraterminal ca2⫹ levels were assayed by on-line fluorimetry as described previously
(33, 35). synaptosomes (0.1 mg) were resuspended in 1 ml of
hbm containing cacl2 (0.1 mm) and loaded with fura 2-am (5

␮m) for 20 min at 37 °c. synaptosomes were washed with hbm
by centrifugation, resuspended in 1.5 ml of hbm, and placed in
an ls-5 spectrofluorimeter (perkinelmer life sciences) at 37 °c
with stirring in the presence of cacl2 (1 mm). synaptosomes
were incubated for 3 min in the presence of muscimol (10 –500
␮m) prior to depolarization with 4ap (1 mm). calibration procedures were performed as described previously (33). briefly,
samples were alternately excited at ␭ ⫽ 340 nm and ␭ ⫽ 380
nm; fluorescence emission was monitored at ␭ ⫽ 505 nm, and
fluorescence ratios (excitation 340/380 nm) were calculated.
the maximum fluorescence ratio (i.e. ca2⫹-saturated fura-2)
was determined in the presence of 0.1% sds and the minimum
fluorescence ratio (i.e. ca2⫹-free fura-2) in the presence of 20
mm egta, added at the end of each experiment. calculation of
cytosolic [ca2⫹]i was carried out assuming a kd value for fura-2
and ca2⫹ of 224 nm, using equations as described previously
(36). cumulative data were analyzed using lotus 1-2-3.
changes in intraterminal ca2⫹ concentration (⌬[ca2⫹]i), 5 min
after the addition of 4ap in the presence of muscimol, were
calculated and expressed as percentage of ⌬[ca2⫹]i measured
under control conditions without muscimol. statistical analysis
was performed by one-way anova followed by post-hoc lsd
test.
drug incubation and immunoblotting—synaptosomes were
resuspended in hbm (at 1 mg/ml) in the presence of cacl2 (1
mm) on ice and placed at 37 °c with stirring to start the incubation. as indicated in figure legends, synaptosomes were incubated with gabase (0.02– 0.4 unit/ml),  xxxd2947xxx  (1–100 ␮m),
or bicuculline (10 –100 ␮m) for 10 min or in the presence of
muscimol (10 –500 ␮m) or isoguvacine (1–500 ␮m) for 2 min
before the lysis with 2% sds. protein concentrations were
measured using the bca assay (pierce), with bovine serum
albumin as standard. equal amounts of protein were subjected
to sds-page and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
immunoblotting was carried out with a phosphorylation statespecific antibody that was raised to specifically recognize serine
603 (p-site 3) in  xxxg2235xxx  phosphorylated by ca2⫹/calmodulindependent kinase ( xxxg329xxx   xxxg330xxx ) ii (anti-phospho (p)-site 3  xxxg2235xxx 
antibody, 0.5 ␮g/ml) or with a total  xxxg2235xxx  antibody (0.5
␮g/ml, both kindly provided by professors p. greengard and
a. c. nairn, the rockefeller university, new york). in additional immunoblotting experiments, antibodies specific for ␣1,
␣2, ␤3, ␥2, and ␦ subunits of gabaa receptors (kindly provided
by professor w. sieghart, vienna, austria) were used as
described (37). primary incubations were followed by incubation with 125i-labeled protein a (0.05 ␮ci/ml; amersham biosciences). blots were exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and
quantification of immunoblots was carried out using phosphorimager scanning and imagequant software (ge healthcare).

immunohistochemistry—immunofluorescence analysis was
performed on neocortical slices as described previously (38,
39). sections were incubated with primary antibody solutions
containing anti-p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx  antibody (0.5 ␮g/ml), antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) antibody (0.5 ␮g/ml,
chemicon), and anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1
(vglut1) antibody (0.2 ␮g/ml, chemicon), for 14 –16 h at

4 °c. sections were then washed (five times for 5 min) in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in phosphate-buffered
saline with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (w/v) containing a mixture of fluorescently tagged markers as follows: goat anti-rabbit
igg-alexa 488, goat anti-mouse igg-alexa 555, and goat antiguinea-pig igg-cy5 (all diluted to 1:750; chemicon). immunoreactivity was visualized using a zeiss lsm 510 meta laserscanning confocal microscope. the estimation of the
percentage of glutamatergic terminals positive for p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx  was carried out in six randomly selected areas (324 ␮m2)
in images acquired from neocortical layers i–iii, layer iv, and
layers v and vi.

presynaptic gabaa receptors regulate ca2⫹-dependent
phosphorylation of  xxxg2235xxx  in glutamatergic nerve
terminals—to detect the activity of gabaa receptors localized to nerve terminals in the rat neocortex independently from
the large postsynaptic pool of these receptors, we isolated presynaptic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) using a well established procedure (30, 40, 41). the presence of gabaa receptor

detected by immunoblotting with subunit-specific antibodies
(fig. 1a, lane s). we hypothesized that the activation of these
receptors may regulate intraterminal ca2⫹ levels ([ca2⫹]i) in a
way similar to changes observed in mossy fiber terminals in the
hippocampus (26). to test this hypothesis, we monitored the
effects of gabaa receptor activation or inhibition on the presynaptic camkii/ xxxg2235xxx  signaling pathway, using a phosphorylation state-specific antibody that recognizes  xxxg2235xxx 
only when phosphorylated by camkii at ser-603 (anti-p-site 3
 xxxg2235xxx  antibody, see refs. 42, 43). this is a highly sensitive
biochemical reporter of changes in intraterminal [ca2⫹]i as
 xxxg2235xxx  phosphorylation by camkii occurs specifically in
response to depolarization-triggered ca2⫹ influx, as demonstrated previously (44). accordingly, in all  xxxg2235xxx  phosphorylation experiments, increases in anti-p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx  in
response to depolarization (4ap, 1 mm)-triggered ca2⫹ influx
were monitored as positive controls (fig. 1, b–f, lanes 4ap).
we first tested whether activation of gabaa receptors with
the agonist muscimol or isoguvacine stimulated camkii-dependent signaling in nerve terminals. immunoblotting with

increase in camkii-dependent p-site 3 phosphorylation of
 xxxg2235xxx  in the presence of muscimol (1–500 ␮m), with 500
␮m agonist producing a 302.2 ⫾ 68.4% increase compared with
controls (n ⫽ 6, fig. 1b, blot p-site 3 syn i and bar graph).
addition of isoguvacine (1–500 ␮m) caused a similar dose-dependent stimulation of phosphorylation, with 50 and 500 ␮m,
respectively, effecting 385.4 ⫾ 132.5 and 670.7 ⫾ 263.7%
increases compared with controls (fig. 1c, panel p-site 3 syn i
and bar graph). neither agonist affected the total levels of  xxxg2235xxx  in these experiments (fig. 1, b and c, panel syn i).
given the relatively high concentrations of gabaa receptor
agonists required to produce the observed effects, we reasoned
that high affinity gabaa receptors (45) may be tonically active,
because the ambient concentration of gaba in our preparation has been estimated to be as high as 1–5 ␮m (at 1 mg/ml
concentration of synaptosomal protein) (46). to reduce the levels of gaba, we incubated synaptosomes with increasing concentrations of gabase (a complex of gaba-aminotransferase
and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 0.02– 0.4 unit/ml)
(47). immunoblotting with anti-p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx  antibody
revealed a significant dose-dependent decrease in camkii-dependent phosphorylation of  xxxg2235xxx  with increasing concentrations of gabase (0.02– 0.4 unit/ml), reaching 59.8 ⫾ 7.7% of
control in the presence of 0.4 unit/ml (fig. 1d, panel p-site 3 syn
i and bar graph), without any effect on the total levels of  xxxg2235xxx  (fig. 1d, panel syn i).
to confirm that the observed regulation of presynaptic
camkii/ xxxg2235xxx  signaling by ambient gaba was mediated
by gabaa receptors, we incubated synaptosomes with
increasing concentrations of  xxxd2947xxx  (1–100 ␮m), a
gabaa receptor cl⫺ channel blocker, or bicuculline (10 –
100 ␮m), a competitive gabaa receptor antagonist. immunoblotting with anti-p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx  antibody revealed a
dose-dependent decrease in basal levels of camkii-dependent
phosphorylation of  xxxg2235xxx , with statistically significant
effects at 50 ␮m (63.8 ⫾ 6.8% control) and 100 ␮m  xxxd2947xxx 
(61.6 ⫾ 5.8% control, fig. 1e, panel p-site 3 syn i and bar graph).
bicuculline produced a significant dose-dependent decrease in
camkii-dependent p-site 3 phosphorylation of  xxxg2235xxx  at all
the concentrations tested (10 ␮m, 73.1 ⫾ 8.9% of control; 20 ␮m,
72.4 ⫾ 8.6% control; 50 ␮m, 55.8 ⫾ 10.3% of control; and 100
␮m, 65.0 ⫾ 7.9% control; fig. 1f, panel p-site 3 syn i and bar
graph). neither  xxxd2947xxx  nor bicuculline affected the total
levels of  xxxg2235xxx  (fig. 1, e and f, panels syn i).
synapsins are presynaptic proteins expressed ubiquitously in
all presynaptic nerve terminals in the central nervous system
(48). to determine whether the gabaa receptor-mediated
regulation of  xxxg2235xxx /camkii signaling cascade occurs universally throughout the rat neocortex (layers i–vi) or only in
certain populations of nerve terminals, we carried out triple
labeling immunocytochemistry, followed by confocal microscopy and colocalization analysis, using anti-p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx

identify gabaergic nerve terminals
(fig. 2, a–c, in red), and antivesicular glutamate transporter
(vglut) 1 antibody to identify glutamatergic nerve terminals (fig. 2,
a–c, in blue). although terminalspecific staining was detected with
all three antibodies, p-site 3  xxxg2235xxx  was detected exclusively in a
population of glutamatergic nerve
terminals as reflected by the overlapping (green/blue) turquoise color
and evidently absent from gabaergic terminals (fig. 2, a–c, merged
images). the quantitative analysis
revealed the presence of p-site 3

i–iii), 19.1 ⫾ 1.7% (layer iv), and
19.2 ⫾ 1.5% (layers v and vi) of glutamatergic nerve terminals in the
neocortex. complete lack of colocalization between gad and
vglut 1 confirmed the specificity
of antibodies used in these experiments. these results, together with
our biochemical experiments, are
indicative of the presence of functional gabaa receptors specifically
on a subset of glutamatergic nerve
terminals in the rat neocortex.
presynaptic gabaa receptors
modulate glutamate release
through control of depolarizationdependent ca2⫹ influx—to determine whether presynaptic gabaa
receptor activity regulates glutamate release, synaptosomes (0.1
mg/ml) were incubated in the presence of increasing doses of muscimol (10 –500 ␮m) or isoguvacine
(1–500 ␮m), followed by the addition of 1 mm 4ap to trigger release.
control glutamate release (28.2 ⫾
1.6 nmol/mg/5 min) was decreased
in a dose-dependent manner by 200
␮m (21.8 ⫾ 1.6 nmol/mg/5 min,
77.2% of control) and 500 ␮m
(22.6 ⫾ 1.8 nmol/mg/5 min, 80.3%

nerve terminal gabaa receptors regulate glutamate release
to monitor gabaa receptor-dependent changes in intraterminal [ca2⫹]i directly, we carried out on-line fluorescent
assays using a ca2⫹-sensitive indicator fura-2 (36). although
the application of increasing doses of muscimol caused no
detectable changes in basal [ca2⫹]i (data not shown), the
depolarization-dependent increase in [ca2⫹]i (⌬[ca2⫹]i)
from 155.1 ⫾ 12.2 nm (mean ⫾ s.e., n ⫽ 5) to 340.2 nm ⫾ 39.1
nm (mean ⫾ s.e., n ⫽ 5), under control conditions, was significantly attenuated at concentrations of muscimol higher
than 50 ␮m (fig. 3h). these data indicate that the ability of
nerve terminals to undergo depolarization-dependent activation of ca2⫹ channels is significantly attenuated by prior
gabaa receptor activity.
gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release
requires  xxxg2079xxx  activity, influx of ca2⫹, and activation of
calmodulin—to dissect the signaling pathway(s) activated
downstream of gabaa receptors in glutamatergic nerve terminals, we tested whether the observed regulation of release was
sensitive to the inhibition of the inwardly directed cl⫺ transporter,  xxxg2079xxx , previously reported to maintain high intraterminal [cl⫺]i in some types of nerve terminals (49, 50). synaptosomes were incubated with bumetanide (10 ␮m), a selective
 xxxg2079xxx  inhibitor, and glutamate release was triggered by the
addition of 1 mm 4ap (fig. 4a). glutamate release of 26.1 ⫾ 0.3
nmol/mg/5 min under control conditions was significantly
decreased to 21.9 ⫾ 0.3 nmol/mg/5 min (83.9% of control) by
muscimol (200 ␮m). glutamate release was also significantly
reduced by bumetanide (10 ␮m) to 16.3 ⫾ 1.8 nmol/mg/5 min
(62.6% of control release). crucially, muscimol-dependent
inhibition of release was completely abolished in the presence
of bumetanide (15.2 ⫾ 1.0 nmol/mg/5 min; fig. 4a), indicating
an important role of presynaptic  xxxg2079xxx  activity, and consequent high intraterminal [cl⫺]i, in glutamate release and modulation thereof by presynaptic gabaa receptors.
with a high intraterminal [cl⫺]i, presynaptic gabaa receptors would be predicted to depolarize glutamatergic nerve terminals and activate voltage-gated ca2⫹ entry. although this
increase in ca2⫹ entry may not be sufficient to trigger vesicle
fusion, it may suffice to instigate the observed modulation of

reversed by 50 ␮m  xxxd2947xxx  (27.1 ⫾ 0.9 nmol/mg/5 min,
92.7% of the control) and abolished by 100 ␮m  xxxd2947xxx 
(29.4 ⫾ 0.8 nmol/mg/5 min, 100.3% of control; fig. 3c). the
inhibition of control release (26.0 ⫾ 1.3 nmol/mg/5 min) by
muscimol (200 ␮m, 22 ⫾ 1 nmol/mg/5 min, 84.5% of control)
was also abolished by 50 ␮m sr95531 (25.6 ⫾ 0.6 nmol/mg/5
min, 98.5% of control; fig. 3d). however, the inhibition of control release (24.9 ⫾ 1.4 nmol/mg/5 min) by muscimol (200 ␮m,
20.7 ⫾ 1.8 nmol/mg/5 min, 83.1% of control) was unaffected by
the addition of 30 ␮m strychnine, a  xxxg904xxx -specific
antagonist (20.1 ⫾ 1.8 nmol/mg/5 min, 80.6% of control; fig.
3e), further demonstrating a specific role of gabaa receptors
in the observed inhibition of glutamate release. glutamate
release evoked by 4ap in the absence of extracellular ca2⫹ was
unaffected by muscimol (200 ␮m) indicating that gabaa
receptor activity does not influence the release of glutamate
occurring by any reversal of plasma membrane glutamate
transporter (data not shown).
we confirmed the gabaa receptor-mediated modulation of
glutamate release using an alternative secretagogue, kcl. control glutamate release evoked by 10 mm kcl (19.7 ⫾ 1.3 nmol/
mg/5 min) was potently inhibited by 200 ␮m muscimol (15.0 ⫾
1.0 nmol/mg/5 min, 76.1% of control; fig. 3f). importantly, the
release triggered by ca2⫹-ionophore  xxxd2379xxx  (5 ␮m, 8.3 ⫾
0.5 nmol/mg/5 min) was unaffected by muscimol (200 ␮m,
7.8 ⫾ 0.7 nmol/mg/5 min; fig. 3g). thus, in stark contrast to
depolarization-dependent release evoked by 4ap or kcl, a
direct increase in [ca2⫹]i without any vgcc activation was not
modulated by gabaa receptor activation. this indicates that
the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed inhibition
of glutamate release by nerve terminal gabaa receptors
involve steps prior to synaptic vesicle recruitment and exocytosis and are likely to operate at the level of voltage-gated ion
channels that trigger glutamate release.

extrasynaptic ca2⫹ prior to triggering glutamate release by the addition of 1 mm 4ap (in the presence of
1 mm ca2⫹; fig. 4b) (51). in these
experiments, although glutamate
release per se (29.1 ⫾ 1.6 nmol/mg/5
min) was not altered, muscimol-dependent inhibition of release was
completely abolished. the release
measured with this protocol was
27.9 ⫾ 1.8 nmol/mg/5 min, similar
to levels obtained in the absence of
muscimol (fig. 4b). this indicates
an obligate requirement for extrasynaptosomal ca2⫹ during the
gabaa receptor-mediated modulation phase. evidently the modulatory pathway needs to be activated
prior to depolarization with 4ap,
given that the presence of muscimol
and ca2⫹ during depolarization as
such (fig. 4b) is insufficient to produce an effect. this also implies that
the gabaa receptor-mediated
inhibition of glutamate release is
contingent upon the activation of a
long lasting ca2⫹-dependent signaling mechanism.
we further investigated the signaling role of ca2⫹ in the observed
gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release by measuring the effects of muscimol in the
presence of 1 mm bacl2 instead of
cacl2. ba2⫹ is an effective substitute for ca2⫹ in triggering glutamate release (33) because it can
enter nerve terminals through
vgccs (52, 53). however, ba2⫹
does not bind calmodulin and is
therefore ineffective in activating
calmodulin-dependent
signaling
pathways (54). glutamate release
measured in the presence of ba2⫹
(29.0 ⫾ 0.9 nmol/mg/5 min) was
comparable with the release measured in the presence of ca2⫹ (25.6 ⫾
0.6 nmol/mg/5 min; fig. 4c),
although slightly increased. however, the decrease in glutamate
release effected by muscimol (200
␮m) seen in the presence of ca2⫹
(22.5 ⫾ 0.7 nmol/mg/5 min, 87.9%
of control release) was abolished in
the presence of ba2⫹, i.e. release in
the presence of ba2⫹/muscimol
(28.1 ⫾ 0.8 nmol/mg/5 min) was
indistinguishable from control

release in the presence of ba2⫹ (fig. 4c). these results point to
a key role of ca2⫹-dependent activation of calmodulin downstream of presynaptic gabaa receptors.
to directly confirm that calmodulin is involved in gabaa
receptor-dependent inhibition of glutamate release, we tested
the effects of w7, a specific calmodulin inhibitor (55). under
control conditions, glutamate release triggered by 1 mm 4ap
(26.8 ⫾ 0.7 nmol/mg/5 min) was decreased to 21.4 ⫾ 0.8 nmol/
mg/5 min (79.9% of control) by muscimol (200 ␮m, fig. 4d). in
the presence of w7 (20 ␮m), glutamate release was potently
inhibited to 16.7 ⫾ 1.7 nmol/mg/5 min (62.3% of control
release), but crucially, muscimol-induced inhibition of release
was abolished (17.9 ⫾ 1.6 nmol/mg/5 min, 66.7% of control; fig.
4d). however, in the presence of w5, an analogue of w7 with
⬃10-fold lower affinity for calmodulin (56, 57), inhibition of the
control glutamate release (26.8 ⫾ 1.0 nmol/mg/5 min) by muscimol (200 ␮m, 21.9 ⫾ 0.8 nmol/mg/5 min, 81.7% of control)
was unaffected (19.3 ⫾ 1.3 nmol/mg/5 min, 82.8% of w5 alone;
fig. 4e). w5 caused a small but statistically insignificant inhibition of glutamate release (23.3 ⫾ 1.1 nmol/mg/5 min, 86.9%
control; fig. 4e). this comparison of the structurally similar
w7 and w5 indicates that it is the more potent anti-calmodulin
activity of the former that abrogates the gabaa receptor-mediated modulation of release. these results emphasize that
ca2⫹ mediates the observed gabaa receptor-dependent inhibition of glutamate release through the specific activation of
calmodulin.
specificity of vgccs involved in the gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate—given that inhibition of glutamate release by presynaptic gabaa receptor activity requires
an influx of ca2⫹ from the extracellular milieu, we applied
selective vgcc inhibitors to characterize the role of individual
ca2⫹ channel subtypes in this process. we started by investigating the role of n-, p-, and q-type vgccs, which are known
to directly participate in triggering glutamate release from synaptosomes (58, 59). to assess the role of p/q-type vgccs specifically, synaptosomes were preincubated with 100 ␮m ␻-agatoxin iva (␻-aga iva) (60). glutamate release evoked by 1 mm
4ap (25.6 ⫾ 0.8 nmol/mg/5 min; fig. 5a) was significantly
decreased in the presence of ␻-aga iva alone (17.2 ⫾ 1.5 nmol/
mg/5 min, 67.2% of control release, or muscimol alone (19.5 ⫾
1.5 nmol/mg/5 min, 76.2% of control release). however, in the
presence of ␻-aga iva, glutamate release was further inhibited
by muscimol (12.1 ⫾ 1.6 nmol/mg/5 min, 70.3% of release in the
presence of ␻-aga iva alone; fig. 5a). the additive relationship between ␻-aga iva and muscimol indicates that,
although p/q-type vgccs contribute significantly to 4apevoked glutamate release, they appear not to mediate the modulatory effects of presynaptic gabaa receptors on glutamate
release.
to block n-type vgccs specifically, synaptosomes were
preincubated with 10 ␮m ␻-conotoxin gvia (␻-ctx gvia)
(61). glutamate release evoked by 1 mm 4ap (25.6 ⫾ 0.9 nmol/
mg/5 min; fig. 5b) under control conditions was significantly
decreased in the presence of ␻-ctx gvia alone (21.4 ⫾ 1.3
nmol/mg/5 min, 84% of control) or muscimol alone (21.0 ⫾ 1.9
nmol/mg/5 min, 82.1% of control). crucially, in the presence of
␻-ctx gvia, addition of muscimol caused a further inhibition

of 4ap-evoked glutamate (17.1 ⫾ 1.4 nmol/mg/5 min, 67.3% of
release in the presence of ␻-ctx gvia alone; fig. 5b), indicating that the modulatory influence of gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release is independent of n-type
ca2⫹ channel activity, even though, similarly to p/q type
vgccs, these channels are directly involved in mediating neurotransmitter release.
a potential role of t-type vgccs in gabaa receptor-mediated modulation was tested in the presence of nicl2, which
selectively blocks these channels at the 50 ␮m concentration
used in our experiments (62, 63). glutamate release evoked by 1
mm 4ap (24.5 ⫾ 0.5 nmol/mg/5 min) under control conditions
was unaffected by nicl2 (22.3 ⫾ 1.8 nmol/mg/5 min) indicating
that t-type vgccs do not directly support glutamate release
from synaptosomes (fig. 5c). muscimol (200 ␮m) caused a significant inhibition of glutamate release (18.7 ⫾ 1.9 nmol/mg/5
min, 76.3% of control release) as shown earlier, but notably the
modulation of glutamate release by gabaa receptor activation
was unaffected by the presence of nicl2 (18.1 ⫾ 0.9 nmol/mg/5
min, 81.2% of nicl2 release; fig. 5c), indicating that t-type
vgccs, similar to p/q- and n-type vgccs, are not involved in
the observed modulation of glutamate release by presynaptic
gabaa receptors.
next, the effect of inhibition of l-type vgccs on the
observed muscimol-dependent inhibition of release was investigated in the presence of 1 ␮m nifedipine. glutamate release
triggered by 1 mm 4ap (24.9 ⫾ 1.5 nmol/mg/5 min) under
control conditions was comparable with that obtained in the
presence of nifedipine (27.9 ⫾ 2.6 nmol/mg/5 min; fig. 6a).
importantly, although control release was significantly inhibited by muscimol alone (200 ␮m, 19.2 ⫾ 1.1 nmol/mg/5 min,
77.1% of control), this effect of gabaa receptor activation was
abrogated in the presence of nifedipine, with release in presence of nifedipine and muscimol (25.0 ⫾ 1.5 nmol/mg/5 min;
fig. 6a) being comparable with that in the presence of nifedipine alone. thus, although presynaptic l-type vgccs are not
directly involved in triggering glutamate release (58, 59), their
activity appears critical for gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release.
finally, the contribution of r-type vgccs activity to
muscimol-dependent inhibition of glutamate release was investigated using  xxxd1315xxx -482 (100 nm), a toxin shown to specifically
block ␣1e-subunit containing vgccs at the concentration
used in our assays (64). control glutamate release evoked by
4ap (25.2 ⫾ 1.7 nmol/mg/5 min) was reduced in the presence
of  xxxd1315xxx -482 (22.3 ⫾ 1.1 nmol/mg/5 min, 88.5% of control
release), indicating that r-type vgccs directly contribute to
release of glutamate from synaptosomes. although 4apevoked glutamate release was significantly reduced (20.4 ⫾ 1.4
nmol/mg/5 min, 81% of control release) in the presence of muscimol alone (200 ␮m), this modulation was abolished by the
addition of  xxxd1315xxx -482, with the release measured in the presence

nerve terminal gabaa receptors regulate glutamate release

discussion
the data presented here reveal the presence and examine the
function of presynaptic gabaa receptors in a population of
glutamatergic nerve terminals in the adult rat neocortex. we
demonstrate that nerve terminal gabaa receptors activate
presynaptic ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent signaling to inhibit
depolarization (4ap)-evoked ca2⫹ influx and glutamate release
from isolated nerve terminals. this inhibitory action is dependent on the activity of the  xxxg2079xxx  transporter, ca2⫹ and calmodulin, and the activity of l- and/or r-type vgccs. although
both l- and/or r-type vgcc appear essential for modulation,
they evidently play distinctive roles in this process given that, of
the two, only r-type channels contribute directly to the release
of glutamate.
we initially defined the presynaptic effects of gabaa receptors using ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of
 xxxg2235xxx , as a direct and sensitive biochemical readout of
alterations in intraterminal [ca2⫹]i (43, 65). the synapsin family of small synaptic vesicle-associated proteins is ubiquitous
throughout the central nervous system but is exclusively localized to presynaptic nerve terminals (66). with this definitive
presynaptic marker, we demonstrate that gabaa receptor
activity increases basal intraterminal [ca2⫹]i, as reflected by
increased camkii-dependent phosphorylation of  xxxg2235xxx ,
whereas their inhibition produces a decrease in this parameter.
moreover, our immunohistochemical analysis to delineate this
signaling revealed its exclusive localization to a subpopulation
of glutamatergic terminals and its notable absence from
gabaergic terminals, the latter finding being in agreement
with the absence of ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent kinases and
phosphatases at gabaergic synapses (67, 68). crucially, this
analysis evinces gabaa receptors as modulatory heteroreceptors on ⬃20% of glutamatergic terminals in the rat neocortex.
the observed changes in intraterminal [ca2⫹]i suggest that
nerve terminal gabaa receptors effect presynaptic depolarization rather than the hyperpolarization that is typical of postsynmarch 27, 2009 • volume 284 • number 13

aptically localized receptors (1). the functional outcome of
gabaa receptor activation is predominantly determined by
the cl⫺ electrochemical gradient established across the plasma
membrane. this is in turn regulated by the activity of cation/
chloride cotransporters such as  xxxg2082xxx , which extrudes cl⫺,
and/or  xxxg2079xxx , which transports cl⫺ into the cytosol (1).
whereas  xxxg2082xxx  is absent from presynaptic nerve terminals
(69),  xxxg2079xxx  has been implicated in the regulation of intraterminal [cl⫺] (49, 50), to achieve the high levels of 20 –22 mm (cf.
somatodendritic compartment), directly measured in the calyx
of held (70), pituitary terminals (71), and retinal bipolar cell
terminals (72). in experiments reported herein, the inhibition
of glutamate release by gabaa receptor agonists was highly
sensitive to blockade of the cation/chloride cotransporter
 xxxg2079xxx . together, the data suggest that high intraterminal
[cl⫺]i, leading to the depolarization of nerve terminals by
gabaa receptors, is of critical importance for the regulation of
glutamate release by these receptors.
whereas depolarizing effects of presynaptic gabaa receptors have been supported by electrophysiological evidence (1,
9), the final functional outcome of their activity at the level of
neurotransmitter release has been contentious given the conflicting reports indicating both stimulation and inhibition of
release being mediated by gabaa receptors (9). as described
here, inhibition of the evoked release by nerve terminal gabaa
receptors has also been observed in the spinal cord (73), frontal
cortex (74), hippocampus (20, 75), suprachiasmatic nucleus
(76), ventromedial hypothalamus (49), posterior pituitary (71,
77), etc. conversely, stimulation of spontaneous and evoked
release of neurotransmitter by presynaptic gabaa receptors
has been described in the cerebellum (18, 19), hippocampus
(21–25), auditory brainstem (27), locus ceruleus (50), ventral
tegmental area (28), etc. typically, facilitation is largely
observed in tissue from young animals. in addition to factors
such as the age of animals, it is apparent that the type of nerve
terminal or the central nervous system region determines the
final functional outcome of gabaa receptor activity. this
would be determined by the repertoire of presynaptically
expressed gabaa receptor subtypes, as well as the operative
signaling pathways and their targets (including voltage-gated
ion channels such as vgccs modulated to regulate basal as
well as evoked intraterminal [ca2⫹]i; see our biochemical
experiments and ref. 26).
we demonstrate that an increase in basal intraterminal
[ca2⫹]i resulting from gabaa receptor activity is an obligate
requirement for subsequent inhibition of depolarization (4ap)evoked ca2⫹ influx and glutamate release, i.e. the modulation of
release is absent in the absence of extracellular ca2⫹ or in the
presence of extracellular ba2⫹. interestingly, when  xxxd2379xxx 
was used as the secretagogue after gabaa receptor activation,
no modulation was observed. these data indicate that gabaa
receptor- and ca2⫹-dependent regulation of vgcc activity
underpins the subsequent regulation of excitation-secretion
coupling.
we elucidated the vgcc subtype(s) involved in the gabaa
receptor invoked regulatory pathway by monitoring its sensitivity to vgcc subtype-specific antagonists added during the
activation of gabaa receptors. although blockade of p/q-type

of  xxxd1315xxx -482 and muscimol (22.9 ⫾ 1.1 nmol/mg/5 min) being
similar to that obtained in the presence of  xxxd1315xxx -482 alone.
to authenticate the role of r-type vgccs in the observed
modulation of glutamate release by muscimol, we carried out
experiments utilizing synaptosomes prepared from the neocortex of ␣1e subunit knock-out (␣1e⫺/⫺) mice lacking the r-type
vgcc activity (31). in wild-type mice, glutamate release
evoked by 1 mm 4ap under control conditions (35.5 ⫾ 1.3
nmol/mg/5 min) was significantly reduced by muscimol (200
␮m, 31.6 ⫾ 0.4 nmol/mg/5 min, 89% of control release in wildtype mice; fig. 6c). glutamate release triggered by 1 mm 4ap
was also significantly reduced in r-type knock-out mice (29.8 ⫾
1.1 nmol/mg/5 min, 83.9% of the release in wild-type mice).
however, the inhibition of release by muscimol observed in
wild-type synaptosomes was completely abolished in synaptosomes isolated from r-type vgcc knock-out mice, with the
release measured in the presence of muscimol (29.1 ⫾ 1.3
nmol/mg/5 min) being similar to that in the absence of muscimol (fig. 6c). together, these experiments demonstrate a key
role of r-type vgccs as mediators of the presynaptic gabaa
receptor-mediated regulation of glutamate release.

nerve terminal gabaa receptors regulate glutamate release

8736 journal of biological chemistry

␣1e-subunit knock-out mice now show that there is significant
support of glutamate release by these vgccs. the question as
to whether direct cdi of r-type vgccs underlies the gabaa
receptor-mediated inhibition is more open. this is because cdi
is generally short lived, yet the regulation of release by muscimol is long lasting because it evidently occurs/persists for some
time after initiation of ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent signaling.
moreover, cdi per se would also invoke p/q- and n-type
vgccs in the regulation, which we observe clearly not to be the
case. an alternative possibility is that the ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent regulation impinges on r-type vgcc activity indirectly, by mediating activation of a phosphorylation or dephosphorylation cascade. interestingly in this regard, in the
dendritic spines of the ca1 pyramidal cells, l-type vgcc-mediated elevations of ca2⫹ are suggested to activate camkii
(and/or ca2⫹-dependent adenylyl cyclase), which then leads to
a relatively long lived depression of r-type vgccs (89). similarly, in gabaergic terminals projecting to meynert neurones,
l- and r-type vgccs collaborate in mediating spontaneous
and evoked neurotransmitter release, respectively (90). a
tenable hypothesis arising from the present data would be
that gabaa receptor-mediated depolarization leads to
presynaptic l-type vgcc-mediated activation of ca2⫹/
calmodulin-dependent signaling, which subsequently effects
depression of ca2⫹ entry through r-type vgccs during the
release of glutamate. this hypothesis is consistent with the
abolition of gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release following the pharmacological block of l- or
r-type vgccs, or deletion of the ␣1e-subunit underpinning
r-type ca2⫹ conductance.
together, our results demonstrate that nerve terminal
gabaa receptors play an important and specific role in the
regulation of glutamate release from a population of glutamatergic nerve terminals in the neocortex. thus gabaa receptors
may instigate a powerful activity-dependent presynaptic control of excitatory synapses, and as such, they represent a novel
functional target for a plethora of gabaergic pharmacological
agents.

(by ␻-aga iva) or n-type (by ␻-ctxgvia) vgccs reduces
4ap-evoked release substantially, conspicuously, the residual
release in each case is still inhibited by gabaa receptor activation with muscimol. t-type vgcc block (by nicl2) had no
effect on evoked release or the inhibition thereof by prior muscimol treatment.
in contrast, l-type vgcc block by nifedipine abolished the
inhibition of glutamate release produced by muscimol (note
nifedipine has no effect on glutamate release in control conditions). although l-type vgccs are mainly located at the soma
and dendrites (78), ca2⫹ influx through these channels during
repetitive stimulation has been implicated in regulation of
gaba release from cultured gabaergic neurons, presumably
through a presynaptic localization and operation (79). more
directly, l-type vgccs also appear to be present in mossy fiber
terminals where they mediate large ca2⫹ currents (80). it is
therefore feasible that depolarizing action of nerve terminal
gabaa receptors initiates a long lasting ca2⫹-dependent regulatory mechanism following l-type vgcc activation.
finally, we examined the role of r-type vgccs in the
observed regulation using both pharmacological blockade by
 xxxd1315xxx -482, and by the genetic ablation of the ␣1e channel subunit in mice (31). in both these models, the inhibition of glutamate release by muscimol was abolished. thus, together
with l-type vgccs, r-type vgccs are implicated in the
modulation of release produced by presynaptic gabaa
receptor activation.
a key question arising is: what is the ca2⫹-dependent mechanism invoked by presynaptic gabaa receptors to inhibit glutamate release? our observations that gabaa receptordependent inhibition of release is ablated by the inhibitor w7,
but unaffected by its inactive analogue w5, clearly implicates
calmodulin as a modulatory player. the effects of ca2⫹/calmodulin on the observed regulation could operate at any number of loci in the release cascade. judging from the lack of
gabaa receptor-mediated regulation of release when  xxxd2379xxx  is used as the secretagogue, involvement of targets downstream of ca2⫹ entry is obviated. this leaves potential regulation at the level of ca2⫹ entry or upstream at loci controlling
nerve terminal excitability.
direct inhibitory action of gabaa receptor-mediated ca2⫹
entry on vgccs themselves is a tenable possibility given that all
the high threshold vgccs have been shown to be subject to
ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent inactivation (cdi) (81– 85). if
vgccs are indeed direct targets for gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition, r-type vgccs surface as the only feasible targets given our data showing that p/q- and n-type vgcc blockade is of no consequence to the regulation seen, and l-type
vgccs do not support release. these observations not only
support r-type vgccs as key players in the regulation seen,
but they obviate the possibility that gabaa receptor-dependent regulation impinges upstream at the level of channels regulating nerve terminal excitability, as such an action would then
be predicted to equally affect all release-supporting vgccs.
there are increasing examples of r-type vgccs supporting
neurotransmitter release in the calyx of held (86), glutamatergic transmission in the rat hippocampus (87) and in oxytocin
secretion in neurohypophysial terminals (88). our data with
