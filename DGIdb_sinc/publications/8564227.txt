1 to investigate the structure-activity relationships of a-adrenoceptor agonists for the ac-adrenoceptor
subtypes*, we have compared the imidazoline class of compounds, oxymetazoline and  xxxd1707xxx , with
the phenethylamine, noradrenaline, in their affinities and also in their intrinsic activities in chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells stably expressing the cloned human ocl-adrenoceptor subtypes (czia-, cib-, and
ald-subtypes).

2 radioligand binding studies with [1251]-heat showed that  xxxd1707xxx  and oxymetazoline had higher
affinities at ocla-subtype than at oib- and ald-subtypes, while noradrenaline had higher affinity at the 0idsubtype than at a1a- and clb-subtypes.
3 in functional studies,  xxxd1707xxx  caused transients of cytosolic ca2+ concentrations ([ca2+]i response)
in a concentration-dependent manner and developed a maximal response similar to that to noradrenaline
in cho cells expressing the aca-subtype, while it acted as a partial agonist at mib- and ild-adrenoceptors.
oxymetazoline, on the other hand, was a weak agonist at ala-adrenoceptors, and has no intrinsic activity
at the other subtypes.
4 using the phenoxybenzamine inactivation method, the relationships between receptor occupancy and
noradrenaline-induced [ca2+]i response for olxa- and ad-subtypes were found to be linear, whereas it was
moderately hyperbolic for the alb-subtype, indicating the absence of receptor reserves in cho cells
expressing ula- and cxld-subtypes while there exists a small receptor reserve for cho cells expressing the
alb-subtype.

5 in summary, our data obtained in cells exclusively expressing a single receptor subtype support the
idea that the relative role of agonist affinity and intrinsic activity may vary depending on the subtype of

czl-adrenoceptor.

introduction
ac-adrenoceptors play critical roles in the regulation of a
variety of physiological processes. recently, it was found that
a,-adrenoceptors comprise a heterogeneous family (minneman
& esbenshade, 1994). two natively expressed subtypes (aca
and axb) can be distinguished pharmacologically, while three
subtypes (ala, m1b and ald) have been cloned (cotecchia et al.,
1988; schwinn et al., 1990; perez et al., 1991; lomasney et al.,
1991). the alb-adrenoceptor cdna clone appears to encode
the natively expressed, pharmacologically defined clb-subtype.
earlier studies using heterologous expression systems suggested that neither the ala- (previously defined as axc) nor xjdclones (previously defined as (xa or oca/d) encoded a subtype
identical to the native xa-adrenoceptor. the uncertain relationship between the cloned and native subtypes has been a
source of much confusion; however, more recent reports detailing the cloning and expression of the rat homologue of the
bovine ala-(previously otc) subtype provide strong evidence to
support the idea that the al.-adrenoceptor cdna encodes the
pharmacologically defined cla-adrenoceptor (laz et al., 1994;
author for correspondence.
throughout this paper, we have used the standardized
nomenclature system for al-adrenoceptor subtypes recently
recommended by the iuphar committee on the classification of
adrenoceptors. in this system, the cloned subtypes are designated by
lower case letters as a,., m1b, and (ld which correspond to the clones
previously defined as alc, mlb, and mia (or ala/d and alid) respectively.
the corresponding pharmacological subtypes are designated with
upper case letters and are defined as ocxa, 11b, and o1d, respectively.
*

perez et al., 1994). the functional role of the native aidadrenoceptor still remains to be defined.
antagonist specificities of al-adrenoceptor subtypes have
been studied extensively, but less information is available on
agonists. evaluation of agonist selectivity is difficult because
both binding and functional measurements of agonist/receptor
interactions are dependent on the conditions under which they
are examined. agonist-induced functional responses are complicated by differential receptor reserves (ruffolo, 1982),
whereas radioligand binding studies are influenced by differential affinity states due to g protein coupling (terman et al.,
1987). without reliable information concerning relative receptor reserves for each subtype, comparing the relative intrinsic activity of each agonist may give false conclusions.
since it is known that the subtypes can couple with different
efficacies to second messenger systems (e.g., the ala-adrenoceptor couples to phospholipase c more efficiently than does
the mlb-adrenoceptor; schwinn et al., 1991), simple comparisons of relative receptor density do not address this problem.
therefore, the quantitative relationship between fractional
occupation of al-adrenoceptor subtype and the receptormediated responses needs to be determined when comparing
the relative intrinsic activity of agonists.
there are two main classes of o,-adrenoceptor agonists that
have different chemical structures, the phenethylamines, such
as noradrenaline, and the imidazolines, such as  xxxd1707xxx  and
oxymetazoline (nichols & ruffolo, 1991). in general, most
phenethylamines are full agonists, whereas imidazolines tend
to be partial agonists.  xxxd1707xxx , however, is known to be a
notable exception to this generalization, in that the drug is an

1612

k. hode et al

imidazoline but acts as a full a,-adrenoceptor agonist in several
systems (jim et al., 1985; ruffolo & zeid, 1985). the effect of
chemical structure on oc-adrenoceptor agonist activity has
been extensively studied in terms of the affinity and efficacy of
the drug since agonist potency depends on the two independent
properties (nichols & ruffolo, 1991). however, there is insufficient information available at present concerning the
structure-activity relationships of a-adrenoceptor agonists for
the various a(-adrenoceptor subtypes. as an initial effort to
investigate the structure-activity relationships of a-adrenoceptor agonists for a,-adrenoceptor subtypes, we have compared the affinity and the intrinsic activity of the imidazoline
class of compounds, oxymetazoline and  xxxd1707xxx , with those
of the phenethylamine, noradrenaline, in chinese hamster
ovary (cho) cells stably expressing the cloned al-adrenoceptor subtypes (denoted cho.,a, cho.lb, and chold cells).
to avoid potential effects of species difference, we used the a,adrenoceptor subtype clones from a single species, (man), in
the present study.

methods

cloning of the human occ-adrenoceptor subtypes
0la (formerly termed oj) human ac,-adrenoceptor clone was

isolated from the human prostate cdna library as described
previously (hirasawa et al., 1993). the 2.1 kb-full length
coding region, including 436 bp of 5' untranslated sequence
and 486 bp of 3' untranslated sequence, was ligated into the
ecori site of the eukaryotic expression vector psvk3 containing the neomycin-resistant gene of pmam-neo
(psvk3neo).

omb human (lb-adrenoceptor clone was a cdna/gene fusion
construct from the human prostate cdna library and pcr
products amplified from the human genomic library. a full
length cdna/gene alb-adrenoceptor fusion construct was obtained by ligation of a partial pst i - bss hii cdna fragment
to a pcr product containing 5' terminal sequence of oem gene
at their common pst i site and to a pcr product containing 3'
terminal sequence at their common bss hii site. the deduced
amino acid sequence of our alb-adrenoceptor clone is 100%
identical to that recently reported by weinberg et al. (1994).
the 1.8 kb-full length coding region, including 26 bp of 5'
untranslated sequence and 203 bp of 3' untranslated sequence,
was ligated into the ecori site of the psvk3neo.
oed (formerly termed cia or ocla/d) human ccd-adrenoceptor
clone was isolated from the cdna library prepared from
sknmc cells and also from the human prostate cdna library (esbenshade et al., 1995). the 2.1 kb-full length coding
region, including 21 bp of 5' untranslated sequence and 357 bp
of 3' untranslated sequence, was ligated into the ecori site of
the psvk3neo.

dna sequencing
the cloned cdna, genomic dna, and constructs were subcloned into pbluescript ii ks( +) (stratagene, la jolla,
u.s.a.). nucleotide sequence analysis was performed by use of
overlapping templates by the abi 373a dna sequencer
(applied biosystems, inc., foster city, u.s.a.) for both
complete strands.

transfection of the human receptor genes
stable cell lines were obtained by transfection of the
psvk3neo containing the human ac,- or ocad-adrenoceptor
cdna construct, or the human (lb-adrenoceptor cdna/gene
fusion construct into cho-ki cells, by use of the lipofectin
technique as described previously (horie et al., 1994). cells
were grown as monolayers in  xxxd2143xxx  (gibco,

grand island, u.s.a.) containing l-glutamine supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units ml"7) and
streptomycin (100 gg mlr'). stable clones were then selected
for resistance to  xxxg418xxx  (600 gg ml-') as described previously
(horie et al., 1994). cells were harvested and membrane preparations were assayed for their ability to bind ['25i]-heat as
described below.

membrane preparation for ['25i-heat binding
subconfluent 150 mm plates of transfected cells were washed
twice with 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline (pbs: nacl
139 mm, kcl 2.7 mm, na2hpo4 8.8 mm, kh2po4 1.48 mm,
ph 7.5), and harvested by scraping. cells were pelleted by
centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min, washed, and the pellet was
homogenized in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer a (sucrose 250 mm tris
hc1 5 mm, mgcl2 1 mm, ph 7.4) and centrifuged at 1,000 g at
4°c for 10 min to remove nuclei. the supernatant was then
centrifuged at 35,000 g for 20 min at 4°c and the pellet was
homogenized and frozen at -80°c until assay. the protein
concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (pierce, rockford, u.s.a.).

[125i-heat binding
radioligand binding studies were performed as described
previously (hirasawa et al., 1993). briefly, in the radioligand
binding assay buffer b (tris hcl 50 mm, mgcl2 10 mm,
egta 10 mm, ph 7.4) was used in the incubation medium.
measurement of specific [1251j-heat binding was performed
by incubating 0.1 ml of membrane preparation (-10
itg of
protein) with [1251]-heat (2,200 ci mmol-') in a final volume
of 0.25 ml buffer b for 60 min at 25°c in the presence or absence of competing drugs. the incubation was terminated by
adding ice-cold buffer b and immediately filtering through
whatmann gf/c glass-fibre filters with a brandel cell harvester (model-30, gaithersburg, u.s.a.). each filter was collected and the radioactivity was measured. binding assays were
always performed in duplicate. for competition curve analysis,
each assay contained about 70 pm ['251j-heat. at this concentration nonspecific binding, defined as binding displaced by
10 gm  xxxd2914xxx , represented less than 10% of total
binding. in some experiments, the incubation was performed in
buffer b containing 200 glm gpp(nh)p to examine the effects
of guanine nucleotides on agonist binding affinity.

measurement of [ca2j]i
the transfected cells at 50% confluency in 100 mm culture
dishes were trypsinized and washed twice with a buffered salt
solution (bss composition mm: nacl 140, kcl 4, mgcl2 1,
cacl2 1.25, nahpo4 1, hepes 5, glucose 11 ph 7.4), and
incubated in the buffer containing 4 gm fura-2/am for 30 min
at 25°c. the cells were then washed twice and resuspended in
bss buffer without the dye. mobilization of [ca2"]i evoked by
various concentrations of agonists was monitored by a jasco
caf-1 10 fluorescence spectrophotometer (nihon bunkoh,
tokyo, japan) with dual excitation at 340 nm/380 nm and
emission at 500 nm (horie et al., 1994). for studying the antagonist action of oxymetazoline, various concentrations of
oxymetazoline were added 10 min prior to the addition of
noradrenaline. agonists induced an acute [ca2+], increase in
the transfected cells that was followed by lower plateau [ca2+]i
levels. the peak [ca21], values from the initial transients were
used to generate the dose-response curves.
[ca2]i, was calculated based on the formula (grynkiewicz et
al., 1985) as follows:

[ca2+],

kd sf3g/b (r - rmin)/(rwa-r)
wherekd is 225 nm in the cytosolic environment, s8o0/380 is the
ratio of the intensities of the free and bound dye forms at
380 nm, r is the fluorescence ratio (340nm/380nm) of the in=

k.

horie et mi

tracellular fura-2, and r,,ain and rmax are the minimal and
maximal fluorescence ratios, respectively. calibration of the
fluorescence levels was performed for every aliquot by equilibrating intracellular and extracellular ca2" with 5 jl of 10%
triton-x 100 followed by addition of 5 jli of 300 mm egta/
3 m  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 9.0).

phenoxybenzamine inactivation method
to obtain the quantitative relationship between fractional occupation of ocl-adrenoceptor subtype and the receptor-mediated
[ca2"]i responses, phenoxybenzamine inactivation analysis was
performed as described previously (tsujimoto et al., 1989). to
examine the effect of receptor inactivation by phenoxybenzamine on ['251]-heat binding, chooal, chocalb, and
choocld cells were harvested and suspended into bss containing
specified phenoxybenzamine concentrations (1 pm-10 gm) for
30 min at 37°c. after incubation, cells were washed three times
with the buffer a and were homogenized for the membrane
binding study. data were expressed as % b/bm., where b was
the amount of ['251]-heat specifically bound under the experimental conditions and bmax was the amount of specific [125i]_
heat binding in the absence of any phenoxybenzamine.
to measure phenoxybenzamine inhibition of noradrenalineinduced [ca2']j responses, chocia., choczlb, and choald
cells were exposed to bss containing fura-2/am and specified
phenoxybenzamine concentrations (0.1 nm-10 gm) for 30 min
at 37°c. termination of the incubation was the same as outlined above. data were expressed as percentages of the [ca2+],
response induced by 1 gm noradrenaline alone.

statistical analysis
computer analyses with ligand (munson & rodbard,
1980) were used to evaluate dissociation constant and receptor
density. in [ca2+]i response experiments, the ec50 and ic50
values were determined with a sigmoidal function using analytical software sigmaplot (jandel scientific, san rafael,
u.s.a.). values are expressed as the mean+ s.e.mean. a twoway analysis of variance with 99% confidence limits was performed, followed by student's t test on individual sets of data.

results

stable expression offunctional ccl-adrenoceptor subtypes
in cho-kj cells
membrane preparations from cho cells stably transfected
with the human cloned ax-adrenoceptor genes showed saturable binding of ["25i]-heat; bm... and kd values for the ala-,
alb-, and xcd-adrenoceptors were 1.3+0.2, 5.5±0.1, and
1.1 + 0.1 pmol mg' protein (n = 4, each), and 110 + 20,
60+1.0, and 262 + 15 pm (n = 4, each) respectively. the ki
values of ax-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists at the
cloned human ac-adrenoceptors are shown in table 1. consistent with their identity as a,-adrenoceptors, the three cloned
ac-adrenoceptor subtypes showed an extremely low affinity for
the a2-selective antagonist yohimbine. the phenethylamines,
noradrenaline and adrenaline, were found to be more than one
order of magnitude potent at the human acld-subtype than at
the lia- or alb-subtypes.  xxxd3000xxx  showed very small differences
in their binding potencies at the three ac-adrenoceptor subtypes. however, there were several agonists and antagonists
that showed marked differences in their potencies to inhibit
['251]-heat binding to the three cloned human ac-adrenoceptor subtypes. among agonists,  xxxd2601xxx  was 25 fold
more potent at the acia-than at the clb-subtype, and oxymetazoline was found to be markedly more potent at the  xxxd1328xxx -subtype than at a1b- and cld-subtypes. moreover, the antagonists
wb-4101 and 5-methylurapidil were found to be 17 and 44
fold less potent, respectively, at the alb- than at the cla-subtype
(table 1).

the possibility that differences in apparent agonist affinity
might be caused by the existence of multiple affinity states
related to ternary complex formation with g proteins (terman
et al., 1987) was tested by addition of guanine nucleotides in
the radioligand binding assays. the apparent ki for noradrenaline at each subtype was slightly increased but not significantly altered when 200 gim gpp(nh)p was added to the
incubation buffer (data not shown).

remained, n= 3, figure lc).

[ca2" i measurements

the quantitative relationship between fractional occupation of
ax-adrenoceptor and noradrenaline-induced [ca2+]i responses
was examined in each subtype by use of the phenoxybenzamine

effects of x-adrenoceptor agonists on the elevation of [ca2]j
were examined in choal., choalb, and choald cells preloaded with fura-2. as shown in figure la and b, noradrenaline (1 gm) and  xxxd1707xxx  (100 im) caused rapid increases in
[ca2 ]j, consisting of quick transient peaks and more sustained
components in chocaj and choxlb cells. in choold cells,
however, the increases in [ca2l]i induced by noradrenaline and
 xxxd1707xxx  were transient, with small sustained components.
the peak [ca21], values induced by noradrenaline (1 jm) and
 xxxd1707xxx  (100 jim) were 1,310+205 nm and 1,297± 183 nm in
choocla cells, 1,550 + 250 nm and 822 + 108 nm in choxlb
cells, 960 ± 130 nm and 451 + 49 nm in choold cells, respectively (n=4, each). the [ca2+]i responses induced by noradrenaline and  xxxd1707xxx  were a1-adrenoceptor-mediated in all
of the transfected cells, as shown by the fact that those responses were abolished by pretreatment of the cells with 10 gm
 xxxd2914xxx  or 0.3 }im  xxxd3000xxx  but not 1 jim rauwolscine
(data not shown). although exposure to medium containing
no extracellular ca2l and 1 mm egta caused a reduction in
basal levels of [ca2l ], noradrenaline and  xxxd1707xxx  still gave
substantial increases in [ca2+]j in all transfected cells; however,
these increases in [ca2"ji were transient, with no evidence for
sustained components. oxymetazoline (1 mm) caused a rapid
increase in [ca2+]i only in choal. cells in the presence of
extracellular ca2" (figure ic); however, the peak [ca2j]i values were significantly lower (p<0.01) than those of noradrenaline and  xxxd1707xxx  in choal. cells (the peak [ca2j]i
responses of oxymetazoline were 328±39 nm, n=4, in
choala cells). in choalb and choald cells, on the other
hand, oxymetazoline produced no or little measurable [ca2+]i
response (table 2). furthermore, the peak [ca2+1i responses to
oxymetazoline in choal. cells were significantly reduced in
ca2+-free medium, and the sustained components were
maintained for more than 10 min. the oxymetazoline-induced

maximal ['251]-heat binding capacity was progressively decreased by exposure to increasing concentrations of phenoxybenzamine in all of the transfected cells, reaching a minimal
level of 1.1 +0.3%, 2.7+0.5%, and 1.5+0.3% at a phenoxybenzamine concentration of 10 gm for choalc, choxcb, and
choold cells, respectively (n = 3 each). the phenoxybenzamine concentrations necessary to block half of the [125i]heat sites were 0.29 + 0.05 nm, 22.8 + 1.1 nm, and
11.2+1.8 nm in chocaia cells, choecib cells, and choald
cells, respectively (n=3 each). the half-maximal inhibitory

seleciit of imidazolines for ai-adrenoceptors
agonistic effects of noradrenaline and imidazolines on

c1-adrenoceptor subtypes

the potencies of agonists in the [ca2 ] responses were compared by constructing concentration-[ca2+]i response curves
for noradrenaline,  xxxd1707xxx , and oxymetazoline in choala,
choilb, and choaod cells (figure 3 and table 2).  xxxd1707xxx 
exerted a maximal response that was not different from that of
noradrenaline in choocla cells, while it produced a significantly (p < 0.01) lower maximal response than noradrenaline in choalb or chookld cells, indicating that  xxxd1707xxx 
worked as a partial agonist on elb- and hxld-subtypes. oxymetazoline was found to elicit [ca2+]i responses only in
choocla cells, whereas it produced no noticeable responses in
choalb and choocld cells (figure 3 and table 2). ec50 values
of concentration-[ca2j]i response curves for oxymetazoline
were thus determined only for the ara-adrenoceptor subtype.

antagonistic effects of oxymetazoline on a1-adrenoceptor
subtypes
as oxymetazoline was found to be a weak agonist in producing
a [ca2+]i response only for the aca-adrenoceptor subtype and
to have little or no intrinsic activities for xib- or crd-subtypes,
we attempted to determine whether the compound might
possess a blocking effect on noradrenaline-induced [ca2+]i responses in each transfected cell. fura-2 loaded cells were incubated at variable concentrations (0.1 nm-i mm) for 10 min
with oxymetazoline prior to the stimulation with 1 gm noradrenaline. as shown in figure 4, oxymetazoline inhibited
noradrenaline-induced [ca2+]i responses in all of the three
transfected cells; however, oxymetazoline showed marked
differences in its inhibitory abilities in the three transfected
cells. the inhibitory ability of oxymetazoline was markedly
potent in chocla. cells (ic50 values in chocra., chootlb, and
chocrld cells were 104 + 16 nm, 7.0 ± 1.8 gm, and 44 + 18 gm,
respectively, n = 4 each).

with the phenethylamine noradrenaline in their affinities and
also in their intrinsic activities. radioligand binding studies
showed that  xxxd1707xxx  and oxymetazoline had higher affinities
at the aia-subtype than at alb- and czld-adrenoceptor subtypes,
while noradrenaline had higher affinity at acd-subtype than at
ala- and alb-subtypes. using the phenoxybenzamine inactivation method, we found the absence of receptor reserve in
choala and choald cells, whereas there exists a small receptor reserve in choalb cells. in functional studies with
[ca2+]i monitoring, we found that imidazolines were highly
selective for the a,.-subtype, having substantially lower intrinsic activities at the alb- and czld-adrenoceptor subtypes.
oxymetazoline was a weak agonist for the ala-subtype, and
had little or no intrinsic activities at the alb- and ald-subtypes.
 xxxd1707xxx  behaved as a full agonist at the ala-subtype, whereas
it worked as a partial agonist at the mwb- and ald-subtypes.
taken together, our present study performed in cho cells
which exclusively express a single receptor subtype supports
the idea that the relative role of agonist affinity and intrinsic
activity may vary depending on the subtype.
as indicated in the introduction, evaluation of agonist selectivity can be complicated by the possibility of nonlinear
relationships between receptor occupancy and response (ruffolo, 1982). in the presence of receptor reserves, only a fraction
of receptors must be occupied to generate a maximal response,
making it impossible to determine the affinities and relative
efficacies of agonists from simple concentration-response relationships. for example, if there were a much larger receptor
reserve in choalb cells than in choala cells,  xxxd1707xxx  could
have similar intrinsic activities at both subtypes. in fact, as
shown by the phenoxybenzamine inactivation analysis,
choaxa and chold cells have little, if any, receptor reserve,
and choalb cells have a small receptor reserve. an almost five
fold greater expression of the alb-adrenoceptor (1.3, 5.5 and
1.1 pmol mg-' protein for choala, choalb and choald,
respectively) might influence the receptor reserve, and thereby
the intrinsic activity. thus, the presence of receptor reserve
cannot be ruled out for any of the three subtypes, and the
observed intrinsic activity hence appears to be a first approximation of relative intrinsic efficacy, and the intrinsic activity in
choaib cells may be overestimated.
the different receptor occupancy-response relationships for
oxymetazoline and  xxxd1707xxx  observed at different subtypes
may partly explain the markedly differing efficacies of these
agonists in various native tissues. oxymetazoline is known to
have moderately high intrinsic activity in causing the contraction of a variety of tissues including rat caudal artery (abel
& minneman, 1986) and rabbit iris dilator (konno & takayanagi, 1989), while it did not elicit any positive inotropic
effect in rabbit ventricular myocardium (hiramoto et al., 1988)
or rat myocardium (gross et al., 1988).  xxxd1707xxx  is generally
regarded as a full al-adrenoceptor agonist in various tissues
(jim et al., 1985; ruffolo & zeid, 1985); however, the present

selectviy of imidazolines for a1-adrenoceptors

data suggested that  xxxd1707xxx  may have different intrinsic activities depending on the subtype. therefore, the differing efficacy of these agonists in different tissues could partly be
explained by the existence of distinct receptor subtypes involved, although several other factors including receptor density and tissue g protein composition might influence receptormediated responses in different tissues.
lack of correlation between agonist affinity and efficacy has
been described in a variety of tissues where receptor subtypes
co-exist (abel & minneman, 1988). in the present study, we
also observed the independence of affinity and intrinsic activity
even in the cell expressing exclusively single receptor subtypes
(tables 1 and 2); thus, typically oxymetazoline has a high affinity but a low intrinsic activity at the ala-receptor (table 2).
oxymetazoline was found to be partial agonist in causing
[ca2+]i response only at the a.a-subtype. the observation is in
good agreement with the recent observation by minneman et
al. (1994), although they examined [3h]-inositol phosphate
formation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in their study.
since oxymetazoline has a high affinity and a very low intrinsic
activity for the a.a-subtype, oxymetazoline can be expected to
behave as a competitive antagonist. in fact, oxymetazoline was
found to antagonize the full agonist noradrenaline-induced
[ca2+]i responses in a dose-dependent manner at all subtypes
(figure 4). the inhibitory effect, however, was markedly selective for the a,.-subtype, possibly due to its higher affinity for
the subtype. interestingly, oxymetazoline was previously reported to act as a competitive antagonist in the ax-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect in rabbit ventricular
myocardium (hiramoto et al., 1988).
in summary, our data obtained in cells exclusively expressing the single receptor subtype support the idea that the relative role of agonist affinity and efficacy may vary depending
on the subtype of a-adrenoceptor. since very few native tissues
exclusively expressing a single receptor subtype have been
identified, accurate information regarding agonist affinity and
efficacy at the distinct receptor subtypes cannot be obtained.
as exemplified in the present study, the approach using classical pharmacological methods to analyze the properties of
cloned receptors in transfected cells may have important implications for the validation and improvement of receptor
theory.
