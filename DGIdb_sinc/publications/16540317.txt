abstract—human methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (hmetap-2) was identiﬁed as the molecular target of anti-angiogenic agents
such as  xxxd2166xxx  and its analogues. we describe here the crystal structure of hmetap-2 in complex with l -methionine and d -methionine at 1.9 and 2.0 å resolution, respectively. the comparison of the structure of the two complexes establishes the basis of
enantiomer discrimination and provides some considerations for the design of selective metap-2 inhibitors.

methionine aminopeptidase (metap) is a dimetalloprotease that catalyzes the removal of n-terminal methionine in newly formed polypeptide chains.1,2 metaps
are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, and
two types of metaps are recognized from amino acid sequence comparisons and structural studies: type 1 (metap-1) and type 2 (metap-2). metap activity is
essential for survival, as the removal of n-terminal initiator methionines precedes post-translational modiﬁcations such as acetylation and myristoylation, which are
required for proper localization and stability of
proteins.3 in prokaryotes, the deletion of the single metap gene is a lethal event.4 in yeast, the deletion of either
metap gene results in a slow growth phenotype, and
deletion of both types is lethal.5 while the detailed biological roles of various metaps remain to be deﬁned,
two independent papers have identiﬁed human methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (hmetap-2) as the molecular
target of the fungal metabolite  xxxd2166xxx  and its
derivatives. these epoxide-containing natural products
are potent anti-angiogenic compounds through irreversible covalent inhibition of hmetap-2.6–8

angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, has
been identiﬁed as an essential step in the growth and
proliferation of cancer cells as well as a prominent feature in diabetic retinopathy, hemangiomas, arthritis,
and psoriasis.9–11
currently,  xxxd1330xxx , a  xxxd2166xxx  synthetic derivative, is
in clinical trials for cancer treatment. although the ability of  xxxd2166xxx  and analogues to inhibit endothelial cell
growth is related to their ability to inhibit metap-2
activity, it is not fully established why endothelial cell
proliferation requires metap-2 activity. this study
was undertaken to better understand the interactions
in the binding pocket and active site of hmetap-2 for
the design of reversible and speciﬁc inhibitors.
lowther et al. have described structural and biochemical
studies on type 1 methionine aminopeptidase from
escherichia coli, emetap-1, and these studies have provided important insights into the structure-based design
of inhibitors for this type 1 enzyme.12 a particularly
interesting example is their analysis of the crystal structure of emetap-1 in complex with the substrate-like
inhibitor (3r)-amino-(2s)-hydroxyheptanoyl-l -ala-l leu-l -val-l -phe-ome, an analogue of the natural product  xxxd3463xxx .12 those results, besides clarifying possible
reaction mechanisms for emetap-1, suggested that an
unnatural absolute conﬁguration at the ca mimic of
methionine—a d - not an l -amino acid—could be incorporated into potent inhibitors.
in a preliminary eﬀort to gain insight into hmetap-2’s
binding pocket and especially to explore enantiomeric

inhibitor binding, we carried out high-resolution crystal
structure determinations for metap-2 in complex with
l - and d -methionine at 1.9 and 2.0 å resolution, respectively. recombinant hmetap-2 was expressed and puriﬁed as previously reported13 and crystals of hmetap-2
could be grown in two days at 4 c using the sitting
drop vapor diﬀusion technique.14 lack of reproducibility in preparing hmetap-2 crystals under the original
crystallization conditions prompted us to investigate
the protein’s stability. n-terminal amino acid sequence
analysis was performed at the bioresource center at
cornell university using pre-formed hmetap-2
crystals15 indicating that a fragment of hmetap-2 starting at residue gly108 is the only detectable species in
our crystals. the crystallization of this stable truncated
hmetap-2 fragment of approximately 42 kda is consistent with the results recently reported by yang et al.16
in their work, analysis of full-length and truncated
hmetap-2 shows that the deletion of the 107 n-terminal
residues from hmetap-2 does not aﬀect the overall
structure of the peptidase domain and does not alter
its kinetic behavior or the binding aﬃnities of inhibitors.

crystals of the l -met and d -met complexes were obtained by soaking native hmetap-2 crystals with saturated solutions of the tripeptide l -met-l -ala-l -ser
(purchased from sigma) or d -methionine (purchased
from aldrich). data collections for the (l -met) xxxg1400xxx  and (d -met)metap-2 complexes were performed at
the advanced photon source (aps, 14-bm-c beam
line) and the cornell high energy synchrotron source
(chess, f2-beam line), respectively. data collection
statistics are shown in table 1. crystals of the two complexes proved to be isomorphous to those previously obtained and the coordinates of the native hmetap-2,
without metals, waters or  xxxd3319xxx , were used to obtain an initial set of phases. l -methionine and d -methionine molecules were clearly present in the active site, as
observed by ra-weighted 2fo  fc and fo  fc maps for

comprising the hydrophobic pocket are 3.79 å for sd
of l -met (sdmet) and cb of phe219, and 3.94 å for
sdmet and cb of ala414.
the carboxyl, amino, and a-hydrogen of d -methionine
must reorient relative to their locations in the l -methionine complex to accommodate the change in absolute
stereochemistry (fig. 2). the carboxylate is roughly in
the same location but with a diﬀerent orientation, and
the amino and a-hydrogen switch places (fig. 2). the
plane of the carboxylate group rotates roughly 90 while
maintaining an interaction with his339 (2.17 å). new
interactions with the conserved his231 (3.04 å) and a
water molecule (2.76 å) complete the interactions of
the carboxylate, which does not interact with the metal
sites in the d -met complex. the amino group occupies
a new location with no p-cation interaction to phe219,
a hydrogen bond to the side chain of asp251 (3.02 å),
and a closer approach to the metals.

of the carboxylate bridges the two metal centers, while
the other oxygen is hydrogen bonded to the imidazole
of conserved his339 (3.25 å) and two water molecules
(2.95 and 2.97 å, fig. 2). in the (l -met)hmetap-2 complex, the amino group of the methionine interacts with
the edge of the p-electron cloud of phe219. the distance
between the n-terminal nitrogen of l -met (nmet) and
cz is 3.0 å, nmet-ce1 is 3.68 å, and nmet- xxxd1050xxx  is
2.86 å, and this interaction will be addressed shortly.
this location relative to phe219 places the nitrogen
2.38 å from metal site 1.
the side chain of l -met is accommodated in a hydrophobic tunnel deﬁned by phe219, gly222, ile338,
met384, and ala414. the closest distance observed
between l -met and residues that comprise the active
site is 3.6 å between sd of l -met and cb of ala414.
there is no signiﬁcant movement of the residues
comprising the hydrophobic pocket upon l -met binding,
which recapitulates the lack of reorganization seen on
 xxxd2166xxx  binding,13 and suggests that the binding pocket is preorganized for binding a methionine side chain.
the ﬁnal model of (d -met)hmetap-2 complex (accession code 1kq0) contains one protein molecule comprising residues 111–478, with a disordered loop
comprising residues 139–154, two metal ions, a tertbutanol molecule, a d -met and 192 solvent sites treated
as water oxygens. the average b-factors for the main
chain and side chains are 27.4 and 27.5 å2, respectively.
the side chain of d -methionine is located in the same
hydrophobic pocket as l -methionine’s and makes
the same hydrophobic interactions. in particular, the
closest distances observed between l -met and residues

it has long been accepted that multiple noncovalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and
hydrophobic contacts play an important role in stabilizing protein folding and protein–ligand interactions.
more recently, p-cation interactions have also been
shown to contribute to folding, stability of biological
systems, and molecular recognition process.22–26 burley
and petsko have thoroughly documented the preference
of a protonated amino group to interact with the center
of the p-electron cloud of an aromatic ring.24 more
recently, zaric et al. proposed a variation on this interaction, the metal ligand aromatic cation-p interaction
(mlacp), in metalloproteins.25 in mlacp interactions, the metal interacts with the lone pair of an unprotonated amino group to mimic a protonated amino
group, which then interacts with the p-electrons of an
aromatic ring. because of geometrical constraints and
the lack of a fully protonated amino group, the interaction is often to the side, not the center, of the ring.
the (l -met)hmetap-2 crystal structure indicates a
mlacp interaction between the amino group of methionine and phe219. phe219, the aromatic ring identiﬁed
to take part of mlacp in (l -met)hmetap-2, is conserved in all type 2 metaps but not in type i metaps,
where phe219 is replaced by a conserved lys residue.
interestingly, a comparison among the three-dimensional structures of other members of the aminopeptidase
family suggests that weak interactions such as hydrogen
bonds, p-cation, and others may be required for proper
recognition and positioning of their natural substrate.
for example, the structure of the (l -met)emetap-1
complex reveals that besides the n-terminal interaction
to metal site 2 previously described, a threonine residue
was found to interact with the amino nitrogen of the
substrate (2.95 å, 30). aminopeptidase p from e. coli
(eampp) is a proline peptidase that speciﬁcally releases
the n-terminal residue from a peptide where the next
residue is a proline.27 as observed in metaps, ampp
is activated in the presence of divalent metal ions coordinating with the same conserved residues. a superposition between eampp and hmetap-2 reveals that

m. c. nonato et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 16 (2006) 2580–2583

phe219 is replaced by tyr219, allowing hydrogen bond
formation with the n-terminal nitrogen from the
substrate.
in summary, the present work reveals the binding
modes of the reaction product, l -methionine and its
enantiomer d -methionine, determined by x-ray
crystallography at 1.9 and 2.0 å, respectively. these
results suggest that diﬀerent absolute conﬁgurations
can be accommodated in the active site and that structure-based inhibitors exploiting both binding modes
could be considered.
