abstract mutations in human caveolin-3 are known to
underlie a range of myopathies. the cav-1 gene of
caenorhabditis elegans is a homologue of human caveolin3 and is expressed in both neurons and body wall muscles.
within the body wall muscle cav-1 localises adjacent to
neurons, most likely at the neuromuscular junction (nmj).
using fluorescently tagged cav-1 and pre- and post-synaptic markers we demonstrate that cav-1 co-localises
with unc-63, a post-synaptic marker, but not with several
pre-synaptic markers. to establish a model for human
muscular dystrophies caused by dominant-negative mutations in caveolin-3 we created transgenic animals carrying
versions of cav-1 with homologous mutations. these animals had increased sensitivity to levamisole, suggesting a
role for cav-1 at the nmj. animals carrying a deletion in
cav-1 show a similar sensitivity. sensitivity to levamisole
and locomotion were also perturbed in animals carrying a
dominant-negative cav-1 and a mutation in dynamin, which
is a protein known to interact with caveolins. thus, indicating an interaction between cav-1 and dynamin at the
nmj and/or in neurons.

introduction
caveolae are 50–100 nm invaginations located at the
plasma membrane of many cell types. they are enriched
in lipid raft associated molecules: cholesterol, sphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and many signalling and receptor proteins (anderson 1998). although identified over
50 years ago, the function of these structures has remained
elusive. however, it is known that they play a role in cell
signalling, and clathrin-independent endocytosis (parton
and richards 2003). caveolae require the caveolin protein
for formation. removal of caveolin from cell lines or from
knock-out mice causes a complete loss of caveolae (drab
et al. 2001). furthermore, introduction of caveolin into
cells that do not normally produce caveolae stimulates
caveolar bio-genesis (lipardi et al. 1998). mammals have
three caveolin genes:  xxxg346xxx  and caveolin-3 are very
similar and are essential for caveolae formation. caveolin2 forms heterodimers with  xxxg346xxx . caveolin-3 is muscle specific, and several mutations in this gene are associated with muscle pathologies including rippling muscle
disease (rmd), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (lgmd)
type 1c, distal myopathy and hyperckemia (woodman
et al. 2004). the mechanisms by which caveolin-3 mutations alter muscle function are unknown, but it is known
that caveolin-3 is associated with the trafficking of dysferlin, a protein known to be involved in muscular dystrophy diseases (hernandez-deviez et al. 2006) and
dystrophin, a protein which leads to muscular dystrophy
when defective (mcnally et al. 1998). a range of mutations
associated with myopathies in the caveolin-3 gene are
known (mcnally et al. 1998; minetti et al. 1998; woodman
et al. 2004). of these, most are single amino acid substitutions and a number are known, or believed to be, dominant-negative mutations.

structs were microinjected  xxxd2274xxx  ng/ll. rol-6(su1006) was
used as a marker to isolate transformants, except for
locomotion assays where a mec-7 gfp plasmid was used
(phab200).

caenorhabditis elegans has two caveolin genes; cav-1
and cav-2, that are homologous to their mammalian counterparts (tang et al. 1997). the cav-1 protein is equally
similar to both  xxxg346xxx  and caveolin-3 from mammals.
previous results (scheel et al. 1999) showed that cav-1 is
expressed predominantly in the nervous system in adult
worms; however, no neuronal function has been elucidated.
to investigate the role of cav-1, we used fluorescently
tagged proteins to elucidate the localisation of cav-1. we
show that it is expressed in neurons and body-wall muscles.
to deplete cav-1, we generated two mutations that are
analogous to previously described dominant-negative
mammalian caveolin-3 mutations identified in patients with
either lgmd or rmd. in conjunction with rnai and
analysis of a deletion mutant, this approach revealed that
cav-1 functions at the neuromuscular junction in c. elegans. we also investigated possible interactions with dynamin. the role of dynamin in clathrin-meditated
endocytosis is well established [reviewed by (takei et al.
2005)]. other evidence also suggests that dynamin plays an
integral part in caveolae function. we show that in c. elegans, cav-1 and dynamin (dyn-1) interact and induce a
locomotion phenotype. taken together, these data suggest
that c. elegans would make an appropriate model for the
study of caveolinopathies and dystrophies.

unpaired t tests were used to compare the mean values

and body-wall muscles

caenorhabditis elegans was cultured using standard media
and methods (fleming et al. 1997; sulston and hodgkin
1988).
levamisole and aldicarb assays were conducted on
ngm plates containing 100 lm or 400 lm levamisole, or
1 mm aldicarb. e. oli op50 was seeded overnight on the
plates. briefly, larval stage 4 (l4) worms were placed on
plates and monitored for complete paralysis (i.e. animals
were incapable of locomotion when prodded) every 10 min
over a 100 min period. radial dispersion assays were
conducted on seeded ngm plates. worms were placed at a
marked spot and left for 3 min, the distance from the
starting location was scored. all assays were conducted at
20c unless indicated otherwise. twenty worms were used
in each assay. assays were repeated five times.
for fluorescence studies a leica sp laser confocal
microscope was used with excitation at 488 nm or, for colocalisation studies, a leica sp confocal microscope
equipped with 458 and 514 nm laser lines was used.
dna and dsrna constructs were injected into the
animals’ gonads. to make transgenic animals, dna con-

in order to explore the function of cav-1 we made two  xxxg346xxx ::gfp fusions in which gfp was inserted close to the nor c-terminal coding regions. these constructs included
4 kb of dna upstream of the cav-1 coding sequence, thus
including all of the putative, native cav-1 promoter. following transformation, both constructs yielded identical
expression patterns. cav-1::gfp was expressed in most, if
not all, cells in embryos. it was predominantly localised to,
or close to, the membrane in these cells although some
small intracellular bodies were also visible (fig. 1 a). this
widespread expression continued into the early larval
stages, but with maturation, cav-1::gfp became restricted to most, but not all, neurons (fig. 1b). staining was
seen in the ventral nerve cord (vnc), and was also frequently observed in the commissures. of particular interest
was the punctate nature of labelling which is most obvious
in the vnc, this staining suggests possible localisation to
synapses. a similar expression pattern with an anti-cav-1
antibody was observed by scheel (1999).
the identification of cells or cell types expressing
fluorescent proteins is most readily performed when the

123

gfp/yfp/cfp fusion and site directed mutagenesis
cav-1::gfp fusion proteins were generated with gfp
inserted close to the 5¢ or 3¢ end of the gene with 4 kb of
wild-type dna upstream of the atg start codon and 2 kb
of dna downstream of the stop codon. a gfp-only
transcriptional fusion was made with the same 4 kb of
upstream dna driving gfp. c-terminal cfp or yfp fusions were generated using the pcr fusion technique
(hobert 2002). in these constructs yfp/cfp is coupled to a
let-858 3¢ utr.
all point mutations were generated using the quickchange site directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene).

fig. 1 expression of cav-1 in c. elegans. a cav-1::gfp translational
fusion constructs under the control of the native cav-1 promoter
reveal that cav-1::gfp is expressed in embryonic cells and localises
to the cell periphery. intracellular cav-1 positive vesicles can also be
detected (arrowed). b with maturation, cav-1::gfp becomes
restricted to neuronal structures, it is particularly evident in the
ventral nerve cord (arrowed). c a transcriptional gfp fusion driven
by the native cav-1 promoter allows for clearer identification of cells
expressing gfp (and therefore cav-1). in this case, body wall muscle
cells (arrows) and neuronal processes are visible

protein is present in the cell body. we considered that the
full expression pattern of cav-1 might be being masked due
to the highly localised nature of cav-1::gfp. therefore,
we analysed a construct that contained a transcriptional
fusion of the cav-1 promoter alone driving gfp. this
construct revealed that body wall muscles also express  xxxg346xxx  (fig. 1c). c. elegans differs from most other animals
because motor neurons do not leave the nerve fascicle to
innervate their target. instead, body wall muscles extend
muscle arms that intercept neuronal process running on the
outside of the bundle in the nerve cord and form en-passant
neuromuscular junctions (nmjs) (hedgecock et al. 1990;
hedgecock and hall 1991). thus, if cav-1::gfp is targeted to muscle arms and/or synaptic regions in body wall
muscles it is likely that it will appear to be present close to
the nerve cord.
to test the localisation of cav-1 in the vnc we looked
for co-localisation with known pre- and post-synaptic
markers. to this end, we generated cfp translational
fusions to the markers and looked for co-localisation in
conjunction with a cav-1::yfp fusion. the following presynaptic markers were used: (1) synaptotagmin (snt-1),
which is localised to regions known to be rich in synapses
and appears to be associated with synaptic vesicles (nonet
et al. 1993; richmond and broadie 2002). (2) endophilin
(unc-57), a pre-synaptic protein required for endocytosis of
synaptic vesicles and synaptic vesicle recycling in c. elegans (schmidt et al. 1999; schuske et al. 2003). (3) synaptobrevin (snb-1), expressed in gabaergic neurons under
the control of the unc-47 promoter (mcintire et al. 1997;

159

fig. 2 cav-1 co-localises with unc-63. cav-1::yfp (green and
indicated by block-headed arrows) failed to co-localise with the presynaptic markers, snt-1::cfp (synaptotagmin a) and unc-57::cfp
(endophilin b) (both in red and indicated by open-headed arrows).
c cav-1::yfp (green) co-localises in some places (yellow), indicated
by the block-headed arrow, with the post-synaptic nachr subunit,
unc-63::cfp (red). areas of no co-localisation are detected and are
showed by the open-headed arrows. d the ventral nerve cord (vnc)
presented with good co-localisation (yellow). embryos in (b) are
indicated by ‘‘emb’’. auto-fluorescent gut granules are also shown in
red

nonet et al. 1998). no substantial co-localisation was detected with any of these pre-synaptic markers (fig. 2a, b,
and unpublished data). thus we conclude that cav-1 is
unlikely to be presynaptic within the vnc.
since cav-1 is also expressed in muscle cells, we
reasoned that it could be localised to the muscle arms
containing the post-synaptic regions of nmjs, we therefore
tested for co-localisation with unc-63. unc-63 is a  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) a-subunit that is
expressed predominantly in body wall and vulval muscles
with some neuronal expression (culetto et al. 2004; hosono and kamiya 1991). confocal images of worms carrying both cav-1::yfp and unc-63::cfp revealed that
cav-1::yfp and unc-63::cfp co-localise in some parts
of the nervous system and in structures that are either part
of, or close to, the vnc (fig. 2c, d). the latter localisation
suggests that cav-1 and unc-63 co-localise in muscle
arms. this pattern may include localisation to the postsynaptic regions of nmjs and extrasynaptic positioning.
within the nervous system as a whole, obvious area
without co-localisation also exist, these are particularly
evident in neurons that express only unc-63 and not cav-1
or vice versa, confirming that cav-1 is not expressed in all
neurons.
the hypothesis that cav-1 is located post-synaptically
at nmjs, reminiscent of mammalian caveolin-3 expression
(carlson et al. 2003), is supported because cav-1 failed to
co-localise with any of the pre-synaptic markers, but did

123

160

localise with unc-63. cav-1 also appears to be expressed
elsewhere in the nervous system—but it is unlikely that it is
at the pre-synaptic membranes of nmjs as it does not colocalise with presynaptic markers in the motor neurones of
the ventral nerve cord.
cav-1 functions in acetylcholine signalling
to test the function of cav-1 in c. elegans, and specifically
in the neuromuscular system, we aimed to perturb cav-1.
we used a dominant-negative transgenic approach to mimic
the effects of muscular dystrophy associated mutations.
two reports have shown that in at least four unrelated cases
an ala46thr substitution in human caveolin-3 prevented the
localisation of the protein to the plasma membrane in a
dominant-negative fashion (betz et al. 2001; herrmann
et al. 2000; vorgerd et al. 1999). a second dominant-negative mutation, asp27glu, was reported in human caveolin-3
in patients with rmd, protein reduction was detected by
western blots, supporting a dominant-negative effect
(fischer et al. 2003). the regions of human caveolin-3
containing these mutations are well conserved in c. elegans
cav-1 (tang et al. 1997), although the equivalent to ala46
is gly126. site directed mutagenesis was used to create the
equivalent changes in cav-1, gly126thr and asp108glu, to
produce cav-1g126t and cav-1d108e, respectively. both
mutations were made in the cav-1 and cav-1::gfp constructs and expressed under the control of the native cav-1
promoter. confocal analysis revealed that cav-1::gfpd108e
had a substantial reduction in detectable gfp whilst  xxxg346xxx ::gfp g126t had only a small reduction in fluorescence
(data not shown). worms expressing the dominant-negative
constructs grew well and did not have any gross phenotypes. we also tested a cav-1 deletion mutant (ok2089), this
strain grows poorly for reasons that are currently unclear.

aldicarb and levamisole assays were used to test the
function of cav-1 at the synapse. worms are gradually
paralysed by these two compounds. previous analysis has
shown that resistance to levamisole, a nachr agonist,
results from mutations affecting levamisole sensitive postsynaptic nachrs, or putative downstream components at
the nmj. whereas strains carrying mutations that reduce
pre-synaptic ach release are resistant to aldicarb, which is
an inhibitor of acetylcholine esterase. it should be noted
that post-synaptic changes can also alter aldicarb sensitivity. the use of these two compounds to dissect synaptic
function is well established (nguyen et al. 1995; nonet
et al. 1998; nurrish et al. 1999; rand and russell 1985).
wild type (n2) and cav-1 dominant-negative worms
were subjected to 100 lm levamisole or 1 mm aldicarb
and assayed for paralysis. both the cav-1g126t (hb544)
and cav-1d108e (hb542) worms were more sensitive to
levamisole compared to n2s (table 1, fig. 3a). the increased sensitivity is most pronounced in animals carrying
the d108e mutation (hb542), which also had the most
substantial decrease in cav-1::gfp expression.  xxxg346xxx (ok2089) worms were also more sensitive (fig.3c). thus,
depletion of cav-1 increases levamisole sensitivity at the
nmj, this again indicates a post-synaptic role for cav-1.
aldicarb treatment had no affect on hab542 or 544
(fig. 3b) or on cav-1(ok2089) (data not shown). depletion
of cav-1 using dsrna had no effect on the animals’ sensitivity to either levamisole or aldicarb (table 1).
cav-1 and dynamin interact at the genetic level
dynamin associates with mammalian  xxxg346xxx  (kim and
bertics 2002) and mediates caveolar fission (oh et al.
1998). we used dyn-1(ky51) a temperature-sensitive allele
of dyn-1 which contains a mutation within the gtpase

although the over-expression of cav-1::yfp disrupted the
dyn-1::cfp localisation in neurons compared to dyn1::yfp alone (data not shown).
to assess whether dyn-1 and cav-1 act in the same
processes we tested the effect of the cav-1d108e mutation
on dyn-1 mutant worms by introducing the construct into
dyn-1(ky51) animals (making hb552). dyn-1(ky51) worms
presented with a large increase in sensitivity to levamisole
and a small increase in sensitivity to aldicarb, compared to
wild-type animals (table 1). introduction of the cav-1d108e
construct into dyn-1(ky51) worms resulted in a further increase in sensitivity to levamisole but a decrease in sensitivity to aldicarb, compared to the dyn-1(ky51) control.
when cav-1 was targeted by rnai in the cx51 strain, the
phenotype mimicked the increase in aldicarb sensitivity
observed in the hb552 strain. however, this was not the
case with sensitivity to levamisole. the observation that
dominant-negative and rnai levamisole assays gave different results might be explained by the reduced efficiency
of rnai in the c. elegans nervous system (fraser et al.
2000; simmer et al. 2002).

fig. 3 animals carrying cav-1 dominant-negative constructs or cav-1
mutant alleles are sensitive to levamisole. a wild-type (n2) worms
transformed with the dominant-negative constructs cav-1d108e (strain
hb542) and cav-1g126t (strain hb544) are sensitive to 100 lm
levamisole exposure. the time taken for 50% paralysis (t50%l) is
approximately 45, 55 and 70 min in cav-1d108e, cav-1 g126t and n2s,
respectively. b neither strain exhibited any sensitivity to aldicarb
compared to the n2 controls. c cav-1(ok2089) worms are also more
sensitive to levamisole and have a t50%l of 43 min. error bars
indicate sem

domain. cx51, dyn-1(k51) worms exhibit a reversible,
uncoordinated phenotype when shifted to higher temperatures (‡25c) (clark et al. 1997). we detected some
co-localisation between cav-1::yfp and dyn-1::cfp,

locomotion in c. elegans is achieved through sinusoidal
body-wave formations resulting from neuronal regulation
of 95 body-wall muscles (chalfie et al. 1985; sulston 1983;
wakabayashi et al. 2004). radial dispersion assays were
used to investigate locomotion phenotypes in control and
dyn-1 mutant animals carrying the cav-1d108e construct.
transformants were selected by expression of a gfp
marker (phab200). control animals carry the gfp marker
only; cav-1d108e animals carry the gfp marker and the
dominant-negative construct. strains were tested for locomotion deficiencies at 20c, i.e. below the fully restrictive
temperature for dyn-1(ky51) function however, previous
results also suggest that the function of dyn-1 is compromised at 20c (clark et al. 1997).
cav-1d108e had little to no effect on locomotion compared to control animals (fig. 4). compared to controls, the
dyn-1(ky51) mutant had approximately 20% reduction in
dispersion; however, expression of cav-1d108e in the dyn1(ky51) background (table 1; dyn-1 d108e, hab200)
further reduces dispersion by approximately 45%
(p = 0.0033). rnai of cav-1 in wild type worms (n2s) has
no effect on locomotion or drug sensitivity compared to
controls (table 1 and data not shown), similarly rnai
seems to have little effect on the levels of cav-1::gfp in
transgenic animals (not shown). but, cav-1 rnai in a dyn1 background resulted in a reduction in animal dispersion
(table 1). (p < 0.0001 compared to the chloramphenicol
acetyltranferase control cat). rnai and dominant-negative
worms have similar locomotion phenotypes, suggesting

fig. 4 depletion of cav-1 in dyn-1(ky51) mutants decreases the
animals locomotion. wild-type (n2) worms transformed with the
dominant-negative cav-1d108e construct had no change in locomotion
compared to controls. transforming dyn-1(ky51) mutants with
cav-1d108e significantly reduced locomotion compared to controls
and dyn-1(ky51) alone. all transgenic strains and controls also carried
a gfp marker plasmid, phab200. cav-1 rnai on the dyn-1(ky51)
mutant replicated the phenotype observed in the dominant-negative
assays compared to the dyn-1(ky51) control-worms injected only with
the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) dsrna control. error
bars indicate sem

that the deficiency leading to reduced locomotion may exist
post-synaptically [since rnai is inherently inefficient in
the c. elegans nervous system (fraser et al. 2000; simmer
et al. 2002)].

discussion
we have shown that cav-1 in the adult c. elegans is expressed neuronally and in body-wall muscles. in the latter
case, the protein appears to be localised to the muscle arms.
this result indicates a function for cav-1 in the neuromuscular system.
our dominant-negative approach allowed us to analyse
the role of cav-1 in the neuromuscular system. as the
system is transgenic it offers the potential for regulated
disruption of cav-1 function. the extent to which the
dominant-negative mutation disrupts the function of cav-1
is unknown. however, the cav-1d108e mutation may
cause a substantial knockdown as the neuromuscular phenotype is as severe as that seen in the cav-1(ok2089)
knock-out strain.
our data on the distribution of cav-1, in particular its
failure to co-localise with any pre-synaptic markers in the
vnc, and the alterations in levamisole sensitivity, point to
a post-synaptic function for caveolin. since cav-1 is expressed in both neurons and muscles, the observed phenotypes may be in either or both of these tissues. although
levamisole action is generally associated with nmj function, it is clear that levamisole sensitive nachr subunits

123

are expressed in a range of neurons in addition to muscles
(culetto et al. 2004; rayes et al. 2007; towers et al. 2005).
cav-1 is clearly expressed widely in the nervous system,
and the failure to detect any co-localisation with pre-synaptic neuronal markers is quite surprising and suggests a
very strong localisation of cav-1. what might be the role
of cav-1 in the post-synaptic cell? levamisole resistance
in c. elegans can result from mutations in the receptors
themselves or proteins involved in receptor trafficking
(fleming et al. 1997; lewis et al. 1980). thus, changes in
any of these, or other components, may cause changes in
levamisole sensitivity. recent work reveals the possibility
that caveolin-3 is required for the proper trafficking of
proteins required for proper muscle function (hernandezdeviez et al. 2006) and this may indicate a mechanism by
which cav-1 alters muscle function.
our transgenic strains utilise mutations associated with
muscular dystrophies in humans, however, all experiments
were carried out in the presence of endogenous cav-1 and
thus rely on the dominant-negative effect of such mutations
for phenotypic identification. analysis of cav-1 mutants
would be a useful adjunct to such studies. during the
course of this study we found that a previously described
cav-1 knock-out strain [vc205, cav-1(ok270)] actually
contained both a cav-1 deletion and a wild-type cav-1
duplication, furthermore, attempts to knock out the cav-1
gene by homologous recombination where unsuccessful
(unpublished data). however, a recently isolated allele
(cav-1(ok2089)) is viable although it grows very poorly and
is difficult to maintain (unpublished observation). nevertheless, it replicates the levamisole phenotype detected in
the cav-1 dominant-negative strains and is negative for an
aldicarb phenotype. when assessing the value of such
mutants we should also bear in mind that none of the
muscular dystrophies associated with cavoelin-3 result
from large deletions (galbiati et al. 2001; mcnally et al.
1998; woodman et al. 2004) thus cav-1 knock-outs may
have some limitations as tools for investigating muscular
dystrophies in the c. elegans system. interestingly,
c. elegans has been used as a model to test the function of
other proteins involved in muscular dystrophies, especially
components of the dystrophin complex (carre-pierrat et al.
2006; mariol et al. 2007; towers et al. 2006). in the future
it will be interesting to test for the genetic interactions of
cav-1 with other proteins involved in muscular dystrophies,
such as dystrophin and dysferlin, as well as its role in
signalling pathways at the nmj.
finally, our results show that the depletion of cav-1 and
dynamin causes a change in the locomotion of the animals,
since cav-1 depletion alone causes no change this is a
synergistic effect. the fact that dyn-1 and cav-1 interact is
not surprising since dynamin is well documented to be
involved in several cell functions in which caveolins have

invert neurosci (2007) 7:157–164

also been implicated in (kim and bertics 2002). we also
noted that cav-1 mutant animals have an altered dynamin
distribution (unpublished data), so this may be the root of
the phenotype. alternatively, dynamin and caveolin may
directly interact in a process(es) required for proper locomotion. the role of dynamin has been analysed at the presynaptic side of the synapse, but dynamin is widely expressed in the cell. its striking effect on levamisole sensitivity, together with a limited change in aldicarb sensitivity,
suggests it might also have an important post-synaptic
function.
our study presents for the first time the use of c. elegans
as a model of caveolin-associated human muscular dystrophy diseases. a cav-1 phenotype at the nmj has been
discovered based on a forward-genetic approach using
information from inherited human diseases. the cav-1 and
cav-1::gfp point-mutations presented here could be a
valuable tool for investigating cav-1 function. furthermore,
the interaction of dynamin and caveolin should be considered for further study in the context of muscular dystrophy research.
