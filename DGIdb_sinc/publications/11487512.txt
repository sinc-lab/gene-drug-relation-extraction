the anti-migraine 5-ht(1b/1d) agonist  xxxd3135xxx  inhibits neurogenic dural vasodilation in anaesthetized guinea-pigs.  these studies investigated the pharmacology of neurogenic dural vasodilation in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. following introduction of a closed cranial window the meningeal (dural) blood vessels were visualized using intravital microscopy and the diameter constantly measured using a video dimension analyser. dural blood vessels were constricted with  xxxg674xxx  (3 microg kg(-1), i.v.) prior to dilation of the dural blood vessels with calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp; 1 microg kg(-1), i.v.) or local electrical stimulation (up to 300 microa) of the dura mater. in guinea-pigs pre-treated with the cgrp receptor antagonist cgrp((8-37)) (0.3 mg kg(-1), i.v.) the dilator response to electrical stimulation was inhibited by 85% indicating an important role of cgrp in neurogenic dural vasodilation in this species. neurogenic dural vasodilation was also blocked by the 5-ht(1b/1d) agonist  xxxd3135xxx  (100 microg kg(-1)) with estimated plasma levels commensurate with concentrations required for anti-migraine efficacy in patients.  xxxd3135xxx  did not reverse the dural dilation evoked by cgrp indicating an action on presynaptic receptors located on trigeminal sensory fibres innervating dural blood vessels. in addition, neurogenic dural vasodilation was also blocked by the selective 5-ht(1d) agonist pnu-142633 (100 microg kg(-1)) but not by the 5-ht(1f) agonist ly334370 (3 mg kg(-1)) suggesting that  xxxd3135xxx  blocks neurogenic vasodilation via an action on 5-ht(1d) receptors located on perivascular trigeminal nerves to inhibit cgrp release. this mechanism may underlie one of the anti-migraine actions of the  xxxd3263xxx  class exemplified by  xxxd3135xxx  and suggests that the guinea-pig is an appropriate species in which to investigate the pharmacology of neurogenic dural vasodilation.
