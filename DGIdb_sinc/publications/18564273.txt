summary
eosinophilic oesophagitis (eo) is an increasingly recognised chronic, relapsing
inflammatory condition of the oesophagus. there has been a mini-epidemic of eo
in the last decade. the incidence of this condition is higher in children and is commoner in males. there is either a family or personal history of atopic conditions
present in a significant number of patients and can also be familial in up to 10%.
the classical symptom in an adult is chronic, intermittent solid-food dysphagia and
food impaction, often necessitating emergency endoscopic removal. despite the
history of dysphagia for a number of years, patients remain well with no weight
loss, which can mislead clinicians to diagnose a functional problem with a resulting delay in the diagnosis. there are various endoscopic features of eo; commonly
multiple rings and linear furrows, though these can be subtle and the mucosa may
be macroscopically normal. the hallmark of this condition is the histological presence of ‡15 eosinophils/high power field (hpf) in the oesophageal mucosa. therapeutic options include avoidance of dietary allergens, topical or systemic steroids,
montelukast,  xxxd2570xxx  (anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody) and endoscopic dilation of strictures
unresponsive to medical therapy.

introduction
eosinophilic oesophagitis (eo) is an increasingly
recognised, chronic inflammatory condition of the
oesophagus characterised by dense eosinophilic infiltration. although eosinophils in the oesophagus had
been noted in isolated cases of eosinophilic gastroenteritis (1) and dysphagia (2,3) the condition we now
refer to as eo was first described in adults in 1993
(4) and children in 1995 (5). in 1982 the presence of
eosinophils in the oesophagus was noted to be a marker of oesophageal exposure to prolonged acid reflux
(6). this was supported during 1980s by the observation that patients with reflux symptoms and oesophageal eosinophilia responded to anti-acid therapy (7).
over the last decade, there has been an exponential
growth in the number of cases and articles published
about this condition, mainly in children, but increasingly in adults. there are more than 1000 paediatric
cases and 325 adult cases reported to date (8–10).
the oesophagus is normally devoid of any eosinophils, although they can be present in rest of the
gastrointestinal tract (11). historically, it was thought
that the presence of eosinophils in the oesophageal
mucosa was a result of acid reflux injury to the

message for the clinic
in any young person with recurrent dysphagia,
unresponsive to anti-reflux therapy, eo should be
excluded. high clinical suspicion, endoscopic
vigilance along with multiple oesophageal biopsies,
irrespective of the endoscopic appearance of
oesophageal mucosa, is the key in recognizing this
under diagnosed, disabling condition.

oesophageal mucosa (4). subsequently, a number of
reports of patients unresponsive to acid suppressive
therapy suggested an alternative pathology to account
for oesophageal eosinophilia (12,13). since the landmark paper describing eo as a distinct clinical entity,
there are studies comparing the characteristics of
eosinophilia in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
(gord) and eo (6,11,14–16). the majority of the
studies suggest that smaller numbers of eosinophilia
[< 5 ⁄ high power field (hpf)] is suggestive of gord
compared with a dense infiltration (> 15 ⁄ hpf)
favouring eo, although there are other histological
features to distinguish between these two conditions.
oesophageal eosinophilia can also be associated with
drugs (e.g. aspirin), infections (particularly fungal
and parasitic), connective tissue diseases, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hypereosinophilic
syndrome (hes), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (ege)
and malignancies (11,17,18).
although the condition was recognised initially in
adults, there has been more awareness and recognition of this condition amongst children. unless
oesophageal biopsies are taken routinely, diagnosis
can be easily overlooked and patients can be
wrongly labelled as having a functional problem.

eosinophilic oesophagitis

the average delay from the time of presentation to
diagnosis is usually in terms of a number of years
(up to 18) which in itself highlights the urgent need
for increased awareness of this condition (19–22).
there have even been cases of inappropriate antireflux surgery prior to their diagnosis of eo
(7,12,19).
the majority of the adult patients with eo tend to
present with easily recognisable distinctive and uniform symptoms (23). with a careful history, endoscopic examination followed by multiple oesophageal
biopsies these patients can be identified.
this article reviews the current literature in relation to epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis,
treatment, possible pathological mechanisms of eo
and dysphagia.

epidemiology
over the past decade there has been a plethora of
articles reporting an increasing incidence of eo. it is
controversial whether this is a result of increasing
awareness or because of a real increase in incidence
or both. the prevalence of eo was noted to be 0.1%
in swedish population (8). in another population
study, about 5% of the asymptomatic population
had oesophageal eosinophilia and nearly 1% had
either definite or probable eo (24). it is estimated
that the prevalence of eo is around 1 : 2500 in children and 1 : 4000 in adults (25). straumann and
simon (26) showed an annual incidence of
1.4 ⁄ 100,000 adult population with increasing prevalence from 2 to 23 ⁄ 100,000 over a period of 16 years.
this increased incidence seems to be worldwide (27–
29). as the significant numbers of patients have an
atopic history and clinically improve with the avoidance of allergens, an underlying allergic mechanism
has been implicated. this finding, along with the
increasing incidence of asthma and atopic eczema in
parallel has led to the theory that eo may be a manifestation of underlying systemic allergic disease (30).

clinical features
this condition has male preponderance (60–90%) as
shown by most of the studies (9,27,29,31). the majority of the adult patients present in their third or fourth
decade of their life (9,29,32–34). the history of atopic
conditions, either personal or of family, such as atopic
eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, food and drug allergy is common in patients with
eo (6,35–38). familial occurrence of this condition
has also been described (39–42). in one case series, 17
eo patients from seven families affecting two generations were reported (43). familial forms of eo seem

to follow an autosomal dominant pattern and are seen
in approximately 10% of patients (11). in a retrospective study of 381 paediatric eo patients, 53% had evidence of allergic condition, 43% had first-degree
family member with allergic condition, 7% had a parent with eo and 5% had siblings with eo (31).
the predominant symptom in adults is chronic
intermittent solid-food dysphagia. the duration of
dysphagia varies from 6 months to 20 years prior to
diagnosis (6,22,33,44). each episode of dysphagia
tends to be intermittent (30,40) and can last from a
few minutes to hours leading to food impaction.
most of the time, the food impaction spontaneously
resolves, although as the disease progresses, it may
necessitate emergency endoscopic removal. for many
patients food impaction needing hospitalisation is
the first manifestation of eo (32,34) and eo may be
the commonest cause of esophageal food impaction
in adults < 50 years of age (45). once the dysphagia
spontaneously resolves, the next episode may take
weeks or months to recur (46). in advanced disease,
the patients may develop dysphagia for liquids and
weight loss.
other symptoms of eo include odynophagia, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, chest pain and even a presentation with spontaneous oesophageal rupture has
been reported (47). in the paediatric population,
dysphagia tends to be less common compared to
abdominal pain, failure to thrive, feeding disorders,
nausea, vomiting and heartburn. older children are
more prone to present with dysphagia (21).

investigations
the key diagnostic feature of eo is the presence of
‡ 15 eosinophils ⁄ hpf in the oesophageal epithelium
(48). however, this degree of oesophageal eosinophilia can occasionally occur with other conditions
such as gord and ege. the combination of classical symptoms unresponsive to anti-reflux therapy,
presence of dense eosinophilia along with response
to usual therapies of eo is required for a definite
diagnosis. significant eosinophilia (> 15 ⁄ hpf) may
reduce with prolonged  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor (ppi)
therapy, and therefore all patients should undergo a
trial of ppi therapy followed by repeat biopsy before
diagnosing eo (15). in clinical practice, the dilemma
usually comes down to the diagnosis of eo vs.
gord. the following features can help to differentiate between the two (table 1).

endoscopic features of eo
initial reports of eo reported that many patients will
have a normal endoscopic appearance (6,19,49).

however, with the increasing recognition and careful
examination of the oesophagus, up to 90% of
patients have abnormality present at endoscopy
(9,37). among 317 adult patients, the most common
mucosal abnormality was mucosal fragility or mucosal oedema (59%), followed by rings (49%), strictures (40%), whitish exudates (15%) and small
calibre oesophagus (5%) (9).
the endoscopic appearances of eo are varied and
there are about 10 oesophageal features reported.
they are linear furrows, transient or constant concentric oesophageal rings, cobblestoning of the
oesophageal mucosa, trachealisation of the oesophagus (feline oesophagus), white exudates or plaques,
fragile ‘crepe-paper’ like appearance with mucosal
fragility, narrow or small calibre oesophagus, mucosal oedema with loss of normal vascular pattern, and
single or multiple strictures (commoner in the mid
or proximal oesophagus) (figures 1–4). in our previously reported series, multiple rings and linear furrows were commonly seen (49). areas of white
exudates may correlate with striking accumulation of
eosinophils and increased dysphagia (50). schatzki’s

ring may be associated with eo (43,51,52); this finding was opposed by other studies (53–55).
it should be noted that macroscopic endoscopic
appearances alone are inaccurate in the diagnosis of
eo and histology is always required.

histological assessment of eo
the american gastroenterological association has
recently recommended ‡ 15 eosinophils ⁄ hpf as the
histological guideline for the diagnosis of eo (48).
prior to this recommendation, various diagnostic

infiltration of the oesophagus as well as varying density of eosinophilia per biopsy specimen. hence multiple biopsies, examined by histopathologists
experienced in the diagnosis of eo, are recommended (37).
the key differential diagnosis of oesophageal
eosinophilia is gord. there are a number of studies
comparing the characteristics of eosinophilia in
gord and eo (4,6,11,14,16). the majority of studies suggest that smaller numbers of oesophageal
eosinophilia (< 5 ⁄ hpf) is suggestive of gord, while
dense infiltration (> 15 ⁄ hpf), particularly in
patients on acid suppressive therapy, favours eo.
one study compared 41 adult eo patients to 116
gord patients (29) and showed a mean eosinophil
count of 39 ⁄ hpf in eo patients compared with
1 ⁄ hpf in gord patients. forty-two per cent of eo
patients had eosinophilic micro abscesses (an aggregate of four or more contiguous eosinophils at the
surface of epithelium) compared with none in
gord. other studies have also shown that microabscesses are specific to eo (16,56,59). the presence
of mucosal oedema, basal zone hyperplasia, lamina
propria papillae elongation was shown to be commoner in eo patients, while lamina propria fibrosis
was specific for eo (28,29).
the presence of degranulating granules in the
esophageal biopsies has also been reported to favour
the diagnosis of eo (29). eosinophilic infiltration
can also extend into deeper muscle layers of the
oesophagus (1,19,60).

manometry tests

cut-offs have been suggested between 15–30 ⁄ hpf
(6,8,9,27–29,35,56,57). the density of eosinophils is
more in the distal (3–5 cm from z line) compared
with mid-oesophagus (5–10 cm from z line) partly
because of the eosinophilia secondary to acid reflux.
hence, it is important to biopsy both the distal and
mid-oesophagus to maximise the diagnostic efficacy
(4,32,53). the degree of eosinophilia in the oesophagus correlates with non-response to conventional
anti-reflux therapy (58).
the sensitivity of diagnosing eo increases with
increasing number of endoscopic oesophageal biopsies (53). one biopsy had a sensitivity of 55% of
diagnosing eo compared with 100% with five biopsies. this is due to the patchiness of the eosinophilic

the majority of eo patients tend to have normal
oesophageal ph studies (6,19,32,56). up to 40% of
eo patients may show mild non-specific dysmotility
on manometry (9). a summary of 49 patients from
various studies showed normal oesophageal manometry in 29. the common abnormalities noted among
20 patients were uncoordinated contractions (30%),
hypercontraction (7%) and ineffective peristalsis
(4%). a review of 29 adults undergoing 24-h ambulatory ph studies showed a normal ph profile in
90% of patients (9). there are reports of patients
presenting with nutcracker-like dysmotility and achalasia on manometry (2,4,9,33).

radiological assessment of eo
the first radiological abnormality of a patient with
eo was reported in 1981 (3). the radiological features seen on the barium examinations are multiple
strictures mainly in the mid- and upper-oesophagus

eosinophilic oesophagitis

along with the evidence of small calibre oesophagus
(32,36,37,61). strictures and the presence of a small
calibre oesophagus are the late manifestations of the
disease; endoscopy is more likely to pick up the subtle features of eo in the early stage of the disease,
and allows oesophageal biopsies to be taken.

endoscopic ultrasound
preliminary reports of endoscopic ultrasound (eus)
in patients with eo suggest eosinophilic infiltration
is likely to involve the deeper layers and superficial
biopsies may not be representative of the underlying
infiltration. one report showed circumferential but
asymmetric thickening of the muscularis propria in
the lower part of oesophagus (62). high-resolution
eus revealed significant expansion of the oesophageal wall and individual tissue layers including the
combined mucosa and submucosa, and muscularis
propria in children with eo compared with healthy
control patients (59).

serological markers of eo
absolute eosinophil count (aec) and immunoglobulin e (ige) levels have been shown to be increased in
patients with eo, especially in the paediatric population. peripheral eosinophilia was present in 5–50%
of adult patients compared with about 60–67% of
children (35,56). ige was also increased in about 56–
69% of adult patients (27,28).
blood levels of aec,  xxxg1964xxx  and  xxxg354xxx -3 correlates with oesophageal
eosinophilic density and increase in patients with
active eo vs. controls; suggesting its possible role in
monitoring disease progression (63).

skin prick test and patch test
skin prick test (spt) and radio allergo-sorbent
immuno-assay (rast) evaluates the presence of type
i, ige-mediated allergic response and patch test (pt)
examines type iv, non-ige-mediated hypersensitivity
reactions and can be useful in identifying the allergens involved in patients with eo. there is very little
data available in adults and 40% of adult patients in
one study had positive rasts (27). in a paediatric
study, a total of 26 patients underwent both spt and
pt to identify the potential food allergens. nineteen
were positive for spt, 21 for pt and 14 for both.
only one patient was negative for both. most commonly identified food allergens were milk, egg, soy
and wheat. only 14 (10%) of the 139 positive food
allergens were positive in both, compared with 80%
of the food allergens being positive in either spt or
pt (64). these results show the difficulty in identifi-

cation of all the allergens involved as well as its practical application in clinical practice.

pathophysiology
eosinophils are important effector cells in epithelial
inflammation at the interface between external and
internal milieu (56). oesophagus is an interface epithelium where an initial encounter with foreign antigen occurs. eo is a localised disease; hence the
factors responsible for eosinophil trafficking and activation are of utmost importance in the pathogenesis.
eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory tissue is a
complex process regulated by a number of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (il)-3, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,
granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx ,
and chemokines such as regulated upon activation,
normal t-cell expressed, and secreted ( xxxg363xxx ),
monocyte chemo-attractant protein (mcp)-2,  xxxg364xxx 
and eotaxins (65–67).  xxxg1180xxx  is the most specific cytokine and  xxxg354xxx  is the most specific cc chemokine
for eosinophils (38,58). also oesophageal mucosa, in
contrast to its traditional role of being a simple
muscular tube transporting food to the stomach, has
been shown to have an active immunological surface
capable of participating in immunoallergic response
(52,68).
the pathogenesis of eo remains incompletely
understood, but the following are some of the factors
implicated:

genetic susceptibility
recently, whole genome-wide expression analysis of
oesophageal tissue in eo patients demonstrated that
the gene encoding  xxxg354xxx -3 was the most highly
induced gene. a single-nucleotide polymorphism was
associated with disease susceptibility (66). this has
been supported by many case series involving multiple family members (11,41–43).

antigenic stimulus (allergens)
food allergens and aeroallergens have been implicated to trigger the onset of eo. as a number of
patients become asymptomatic once the offending
food allergen is eliminated, the triggering effect of
the food antigen has been proposed as a key initiating feature in the pathogenesis (7,8,16,31,56). as
many patients are reported to have positive spt
and ⁄ or positive pt, both ige-dependent and nonige-dependent mechanisms are thought to be operative in eo.
the role of aeroallergens in eo has been studied
in murine models. it has been suggested that the
oesophageal eosinophilic inflammation may be
mechanistically linked with pulmonary inflammation.

eosinophilic oesophagitis

the exposure of mice to intranasal allergen induced
eosinophilic inflammation of both lung and oesophagus; however, oral and intragastric allergen exposure
failed to promote eo (65). intranasal allergen inoculation to non-anaesthetised mice, bypassing allergen
delivery to the lung, failed to induce pulmonary and
oesophageal inflammation which led to the speculation that primary sensitisation occurs through the
lung. when these sensitised mice were subsequently
exposed to the oral allergen deposited by the intranasal application, they developed a hypersensitivity
response that led to an eosinophil infiltration into
the oesophagus. the delivery of th2 cytokine il-13
to the lung in mice also induced experimental eo
supporting the role of aeroallergens in eo (69). the
role of aeroallergens is supported by a case report of
a patient with symptomatic and histological exacerbations during pollen seasons (70). recently akei
et al. (71) have shown, in murine model, that primary skin sensitisation with an antigenic stimulus
can also result in oesophageal eosinophilia.

cytokines ( xxxg1180xxx ) and chemokines ( xxxg354xxx -3)
the role of eosinophil-directed cytokines and chemokines in eo has been studied extensively in mouse
models (56,58,65,66,69). fujiwara et al. (67) reported
the expression of the  xxxg354xxx  in human oesophagus
in an eo patient in 2002. murine models have suggested that eo is a th2-associated disease, with  xxxg1180xxx 
and the  xxxg354xxx  subfamily of chemokines (composed
of  xxxg354xxx ,  xxxg354xxx -2 and  xxxg354xxx -3), being vital for
its pathogenesis.
induction of experimental eo in animal models
was abolished in  xxxg1180xxx -deficient mice and partially
reduced in  xxxg354xxx -deficient mice, demonstrating the
central role of  xxxg1180xxx  in inducing eosinophilic trafficking to oesophagus (58,65).  xxxg1180xxx  may induce eosinophil trafficking to the oesophagus by enhancing
eosinophil responsiveness to endogenous chemokines
expressed by the oesophagus, such as  xxxg354xxx  or by
up-regulating homing receptors specifically involved
in eosinophil trafficking. blanchard et al. (66) have
suggested that  xxxg354xxx -3 is the key chemokine
involved in the pathogenesis of eo and the mice
deficient in  xxxg354xxx  receptor cc  xxxg565xxx 
3 (ccr3) were protected from the experimental eo.

immune dysregulation
immunohistochemical examination of oesophageal
tissue in eo patients has shown increased t- and
mast-cell numbers suggestive of possible immune
dysregulation (16,30). teitelbaum et al. (68) showed
increased oesophageal mucosal cd3 and cd8 t cells,
as well as  xxxg376xxx  antigen presenting cells in paediatric
eo patients.

as the majority of patients have an atopic background, it is possible that systemic atopic sensitisation might play a role in the overall pathogenesis of
eo. the pattern of inflammatory cells and cytokine
expression in eo is similar to the findings in allergic
diseases of the airways or the skin. hence eo may
be an additional manifestation of systemic atopy
(72).
the majority of eo patients had preceding allergic
airway disease suggesting that initial sensitisation
might take place in the airways. aeroallergens might
sensitise the oesophagus, but are unlikely to be the
direct causative antigens as studies have consistently
shown improvement with elimination diets (64).
histological and immunopathogenic characteristics
in adult eo patients are similar to many features of
chronic airway inflammation in bronchial asthma,
hence eo may be considered as ‘asthma of the
oesophagus’ (56).
ultimately, eo may be a common end-point for
different inflammatory pathways involving dietary
and airborne allergens, and interactions between
the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tract.
alternatively, some cases could be associated
with immune dysregulation and might not reflect
hypersensitivity driven by the discrete antigens
(60).

mechanisms of tissue injury and
dysphagia
the presence of eosinophils alone does not cause
epithelial damage, but eosinophilic degranulation
does correlates with tissue damage (30). eosinophils
cause epithelial injury via release of mediators such
as cytotoxic granule proteins, reactive oxygen intermediates, lipid mediators and cytokines (8,56,73).
eosinophils release four cytotoxic cationic proteins
including major basic protein (mbp). the ongoing
inflammatory response results in both structural and
functional oesophageal abnormalities leading onto
clinical manifestations of eo.
dysphagia could be a result of: (i) transient
smooth muscle spasm induced by activation of
eosinophils or mast cells; (ii) luminal stenosis caused
by inflammation induced oesophageal fibrosis and
shrinking or (iii) loss of elasticity of the mucosa with
alteration of the oesophageal transport function due
to remodelling (28,40).

dysphagia because of transient muscular
contractions
in many patients with dysphagia or food bolus
obstruction, the oesophageal mucosa looks normal
without stricturing. this finding along with the

eosinophilic oesophagitis

reversibility of dysphagia with steroid therapy has
led to the theory of transient muscular contractions causing symptoms (31,46,52). degranulation
of eosinophils and mast cells release potent stimulators of smooth muscle contractors such as mbp,
leukotrienes and histamine. mbp can act as an
antagonist at the muscarinic m2 receptors of acetylcholine directly increasing the smooth muscle
contractions (30) and has shown to be increased
in eo (51).

dysphagia because of luminal stenosis
oesophageal stenosis with food impaction is a consistent feature in eo patients. recent reports of
improving dysphagia as well reversibility of the endoscopically impassable oesophageal strictures with steroid therapy alone, support an inflammatory rather
than fibrotic nature of these strictures (31,46,52).
schatzki’s ring may result in dysphagia in eo
patients (43,51,52).

dysphagia because of altered oesophageal
transport function
it has been suggested that eosinophilic infiltration of
the oesophagus results in dysmotility (73). this has
been supported by eus studies showing muscularis
propria hypertrophy in eo patients; however, correlation of these eus findings to oesophageal dysmotility and clinical symptoms require further study
(59,62).
the fragile and inelastic mucosa seen in some
patients indicates an ongoing remodelling process
which could be responsible for the altered oesophageal transport function resulting in dysphagia. however, further evidence would require full thickness
morphological examination of the oesophagus (28).

treatment
various treatment modalities have been shown to be
effective in the management of eo (7,16,19,32–
34,74–81), although only two of these have been subjected to randomised controlled trials (74,79). diet
studies argue that only dietary therapy addresses the
primary pathology, whereas, other therapies affect
the final manifestations of the disease (16). hence
with the ever increasing understanding of this disease, in the future we may be able to fully understand the pathogenesis and treat with the following
goals:
• symptom resolution – acceptable if patients do not
progress to develop long-term complications;
• resolution of inflammation – this should be the
therapeutic aim if long-term studies show progres-

sion to stricturing disease or other complications
(60).
treatment options can be broadly classified into
three categories.
• dietary therapy – elimination diet or elemental
diet.
• pharmacological therapy – systemic steroids, topical steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonist (ltra)
and anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody.
• endoscopic therapy – dilatation of strictures
(should usually be considered after failed pharmacological therapy).

dietary therapy
this consists of either ‘dietary restriction’, the exclusion of selected foods based on allergy testing, or
‘complete dietary elimination’ of all foods with
patients being placed strictly on an amino acid-based
hypoallergenic formula. the evidence of dietary therapy come from paediatric studies (7,16,31). the
advantages of this treatment are removal of the
offending allergen, hence dealing with the underlying
cause, and no adverse side effects. the disadvantages
are its expense and unpalatability needing frequent
nasogastric (ng) feeding. close supervision from the
parents is required along with repeat endoscopies
and oesophageal biopsies. allergy testing using spt
and pt provide limited value in majority of the
patients with eo. usually, more than one food is
involved and the process of elimination and reintroduction can be a long, laborious process, and is unlikely to be practical in majority of the adult patients
(14).
kelly et al. (5) first reported the efficacy of elemental diet in 10 children with eo treated for a
median of 17 weeks. eight patients became asymptomatic and two showed improvement. the oesophageal eosinophilia decreased significantly, however all
patients redeveloped their symptoms on open food
challenges.
markowitz et al. (16) reported striking improvements in both symptoms and histology in 49 of 51
eo patients. these patients were given an elemental
formula consisting of free amino acids, corn syrup

and the number of eosinophils ⁄ hpf decreased significantly from 33.7 before the diet to 1.0 after the diet
(p < 0.01).
liacouras et al. presented a retrospective study of
largest number of paediatric patients undergoing dietary therapy (n = 247). all of the 75 patients in the

eosinophilic oesophagitis

‘dietary restriction’ group, based on the spt and pt,
showed a significant symptomatic as well as histological resolution. the other 172 patients received
amino acid-based formula. 80% were fed by ng tube
and 20% took the formula orally. 160 (97%) of the
164 diet compliant patients demonstrated significant
improvement in clinical symptoms and oesophageal
eosinophilia. during follow up, 84% of the patients
were able to discontinue the elemental diet over a
period of 3 to 18 months (31).

pharmacological therapy
systemic corticosteroids
systemic steroids have consistently been shown to be
effective in inducing symptomatic as well as histological improvement (6,9,13,25,46,60,76,79), even in
patients with severe oesophageal strictures and to
reduce the need for repeated dilatations. the major
drawback with this treatment is the recurrence of
symptoms after cessation of therapy. the need for
repeated courses raised concerns about the side
effects, in particular, the growth suppression in children. hence systemic corticosteroids have been
increasingly replaced by topical steroid therapy.
glucocorticoids are the most effective agents for
reducing eosinophilia. the main action of glucocorticoids on eosinophil-active cytokines involves
mrna destabilisation reducing the half-life of cytokines. in addition, steroids inhibit the cytokine
dependent survival of eosinophils (25).
liacouras et al. (13) demonstrated the effectiveness
of oral corticosteroids in 20 paediatric patients with
eo. the patients were given oral methylprednisolone
(1.5 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day in two divided doses) for 4 weeks
and tapered over the next 6 weeks. nineteen of 20
patients showed significant symptomatic as well as
histological improvement after 4 weeks treatment.
the average time to clinical improvement was
8 days. at 12 months follow up, 10 remained asymptomatic and nine developed recurrence of symptoms.
an adult study reported 100% response to systemic
corticosteroids (19 patients) and 95% response to
topical steroid therapy (36 patients) (9).
gupta et al. (79) compared oral prednisone to
swallowed fluticasone in a prospective, randomised
paediatric study. prednisone (1 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ dose bid),
fluticasone (110 mcg for age < 11 years and 220 mcg
for age > 11 years; two puffs bid) were given for
4 weeks followed by tapering over the next 8 weeks.
at 4 weeks, all patients treated with oral steroids
were asymptomatic (20 ⁄ 20) compared with 19 of 22
in fluticasone group. there was a significant histological improvement in both the groups with degree
of improvement better with prednisolone than fluti-

casone. however, this did not translate into better
long-term disease remission.

topical steroid therapy
concerns regarding the side effects of systemic
steroids led to the use of topical steroid therapy.
faubion et al. (81) reported the first use of topical
steroids to treat four patients with eo in 1998. fluticasone proprionate is the preferred topical steroid
because of its low oral bioavailability and rapid
first-pass metabolism in the liver (74). topical
steroid therapy has been shown to be effective in
resolution of clinical symptoms as well as histological changes (9,32,33,41,51,56,68,74,75,80–82), and
decreases the need for oesophageal dilatations
(32,33,51). the possible side effects are oesophageal
candidiasis and dysphonia. when the drug is
inhaled without a spacer, about 80% of the drug is
deposited in the oesophagus (83). based on this
finding, faubion et al. theorised that ingestion of
the same drug would increase the oesophageal drug
delivery and would treat the eo. this would also
limit systemic absorption as the steroid absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract undergoes first-pass
metabolism in the liver.
there is only one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of  xxxd2145xxx  (fp)
therapy in eo (74). thirty-six paediatric patients
were randomly assigned to receive either 880 mcg of
fp (21 patients) or placebo (15 patients) divided
twice daily for 3 months. fifty per cent of fp-treated
patients achieved histological remission compared
with 9% of patients receiving placebo (p = 0.047).
the histological remission in the fp group was more
pronounced in non-allergenic and younger individuals, especially in the proximal oesophagus (74,82).
the histological improvement was less striking than
the previous non-randomised published reports of
> 90%. the possible explanations were lack of monitoring of drug compliance in this study, lack of strict
histological definition of remission in previous studies along with the possible publication bias. however,
it was interesting to note that 9–18% of patients
showed spontaneous histological remission within
3 months which might point towards the natural
regression of eo in some patients (74).
arora et al. (33) reported the use of fp in 21 adult
patients. all these patients had solid-food dysphagia
and 15 of them, prior food impaction; 220 mcg of
swallowed fp twice daily for 6 weeks was used. all
patients reported complete resolution of their solidfood dysphagia usually within 2 weeks of therapy.
none of the 16 patients who had required oesophageal dilations prior to steroid therapy required dilations for 8–12 months after therapy. three patients

eosinophilic oesophagitis

required additional courses of fp for relapse of dysphagia.
in patients who were unresponsive or unable to
use the fp for various reasons, the use of oral suspension of budesonide has been recommended
(75,80). developmental delay was identified as the
most likely associated problem present in 15% of
patients precluding fp use (84). aceves et al. (75)
reported two paediatric eo patients, with developmental delay, demonstrating clinical and histological
improvement to oral budesonide suspension, after
one failed to respond and another was unable to use
fp. the same group reported once daily use of
1–2 mg budesonide in 14 children with eo, three of
who had failed fluticasone therapy. three to
4 months of therapy resulted in a significant decrease
in the oesophageal eosinophil count, improvement in
the oesophageal endoscopic abnormalities and symptomatic improvement. one patient developed
oesophageal candidiasis. these results are preliminary
and further trials are warranted to evaluate its use in
the management of eo (80).

ltra therapy – montelukast
montelukast was originally licensed as a cystienyl
ltra for use in asthma. it actively and selectively
blocks the leukotriene  xxxg658xxx  of cystienyl leukotrienes present in eosinophils. the actions of leukotrienes include: eosinophil attraction and migration
and powerful constriction of smooth muscle. by
blocking the  xxxg658xxx  the inflammatory action of
the eosinophil cell is negated but the numbers of
eosinophils remain unaltered.
attwood et al. (19) first reported the use of montelukast in adult patients. eight patients were treated
with montelukast for a varying duration of 4–
28 months with a median of 14 months. six of eight
patients reported complete subjective improvement
and the other two partial improvements. there were
no symptom recurrences on maintenance therapy;
however, six patients experienced the symptom
recurrence within 3 weeks of either cessation or dose
reduction. side effects included nausea in four
patients and myalgia in one patient. the subjective
improvement of symptoms in both paediatric and
adult patients has also been replicated in a case
report and smaller case series (46,49,76).

anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody therapy –  xxxd2570xxx 
 xxxg1180xxx  is a crucial cytokine implicated in the
pathogenesis of eo.  xxxg1180xxx  is produced by t cells, mast
cells, and eosinophils and acts selectively on eosinophils by regulating their production, differentiation,
recruitment, activation and survival. anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibodies have been used to treat conditions associated

with eosinophilia, such as bronchial asthma, atopic
dermatitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, hes (77,78).
stein et al. (78) conducted an open-label phase
i ⁄ ii safety and efficacy study of  xxxd2570xxx  in four
adult patients with eo. all these patients had significant symptoms unresponsive to various therapies
including oral and topical steroids and were given
three infusions of  xxxd2570xxx  (750 mg intravenously monthly). this therapy was associated with
marked decrease in peripheral and oesophageal
eosinophilia along with resultant improved clinical
outcome and quality of life.

endoscopic therapy
endoscopic oesophageal dilatations have been
reported to improve dysphagia in patients with dysphagia in majority of the patients. problems associated
with dilations are the need for repeat dilations and
increased risk of mucosal tears in the fragile oesophagus seen in eo. hence it is advisable to use pharmacological therapy (topical or systemic steroids), even in
patients with impassable oesophageal strictures, before
considering dilatation (9,22,33,34,36,37,56).
a review of 64 adult patients from 11 studies
showed extensive mucosal shearing after the passage
of push dilators in majority of the patients. in this
series, 9.3% of patients needed hospitalisation for
severe chest pain postdilation and 1.5% (one patient)
suffered oesophageal perforation. immediate symptomatic improvement noted in 83% of patients
and symptomatic recurrence was common within
3–8 months (9). despite the lack of any direct
evidence, in view of the mucosal fragility in eo
patients, we recommend dilation under direct endoscopic guidance using balloon dilators than push
dilators which can subject the oesophageal mucosa
to shear stress increasing the risk of perforation.

recommendations
from the available information so far, we would recommend the following management pathway for
adult patients with eo. all patients with dysphagia
and food bolus obstruction history should have a
gastroscopy, and if no obvious cause found to
explain the symptom, 3–5 oesophageal biopsies each
from distal and mid-oesophagus should routinely be
taken to exclude eo. if there is oesophageal eosinophilia, we would recommend the following pathway
(figure 5).

prognosis
the long-term prognosis is unknown, but is likely to
be benign as the majority of the patients are symp-

tomatic for a number of years (up to 30 years) prior
to the diagnosis. in the longest adult follow-up
study, 30 patients were followed up to 11.5 years
(mean 7.2 years). all the patients remained well and
none of these patients progressed to ege, hes or
malignancy. dysphagia persisted in 29 of 30 patients
with major impact on quality of life in one patient
and minor impact in 15 patients. dysphagia severity
increased in 23.3%, was stable in 36.7%, decreased in
36.7% and completely resolved in one patient
(3.4%). the patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia or more pronounced endoscopic features had
a less favourable course (28).
patients with allergic disorders, such as food
allergy and atopic dermatitis, often outgrow their
allergies as they grow older (56,85). the density of
oesophageal eosinophilic infiltrate has been shown

to be inversely proportional to the age with gradual decline with time (57). all these findings may
explain the increased incidence of eo in children.
whether majority of the paediatric eo patients
‘outgrow’ the condition by adulthood and eo in
adults represent the paediatric patients in whom
spontaneous resolution fail to occur remains to be
seen.

the future
the future in the management of eo looks promising and exciting. the recent finding of the eotaxin3, the highly induced gene in eo patients, will
hopefully help us in the understanding of various
factors involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. further research is necessary to define the

exact role of many cytokines and chemokines
involved in eo so that appropriate therapeutic targets can be developed. the link between the rise in
allergic disorders and eo needs to be defined. there
is a possibility of developing non-invasive biochemical markers to monitor the disease response to
therapy without the need for repetitive invasive
endoscopy. there is an ongoing study looking at
serum, urinary and faecal cd23 as a non-invasive
tool to diagnose and monitor response to therapy.
regarding the pharmacological therapy of eo, there
are a number of ongoing trials evaluating efficacy of
drugs such as intravenous  xxxd2570xxx , subcutaneous  xxxd2784xxx , fluticasone proprionate, esomeprazole and topical budesonide in eo patients. there
are also possibilities of developing  xxxg354xxx -3 or
ccr3 receptor blockers as a potential therapeutic
target. hopefully, these trials along with better
understanding of pathogenesis will help us in formulating a definitive management plan for the treatment of eo patients in the near future.
