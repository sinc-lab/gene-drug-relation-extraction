5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) is an antiinflammatory drug widely used in the treatment of
inflammatory bowel diseases. it is known to inhibit the production of cytokines and
inflammatory mediators, but the mechanism underlying the intestinal effects of  xxxd2579xxx 
remains unknown. based on the common activities of peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor- (ppar-) ligands and  xxxd2579xxx , we hypothesized that this nuclear receptor
mediates  xxxd2579xxx  therapeutic action. to test this possibility, colitis was induced in heterozygous
ppar-/ mice and their wild-type littermates, which were then treated with  xxxd2579xxx .  xxxd2579xxx 
treatment had a beneficial effect on colitis only in wild-type and not in heterozygous mice.
in epithelial cells,  xxxd2579xxx  increased ppar- expression, promoted its translocation from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus, and induced a modification of its conformation permitting the
recruitment of coactivators and the activation of a peroxisome-proliferator response element–
driven gene. validation of these results was obtained with organ cultures of human colonic
biopsies. these data identify ppar- as a target of  xxxd2579xxx  underlying antiinflammatory
effects in the colon.

5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) is among the
oldest antiinflammatory agents in use today for
the treatment of crohn’s disease and ulcerative
colitis, two major human forms of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds). in 1942,
 xxxd2579xxx  was initially combined with an antibiotic
sulfapyridine in a molecule named  xxxd3255xxx  (1). thirty-five years later, azad khan et
al. demonstrated that  xxxd2579xxx  was the therapeutically active moiety of this drug with proven
antiinflammatory effects in ibds (2). after oral
or rectal administration,  xxxd2579xxx  acts locally in
the colon and is absorbed by colonic epithelial
cells (3–5). the effectiveness of the drug is related to its mucosal concentration (6), and sysc. rousseaux and b. lefebvre contributed equally to this work.

putative antiinflammatory actions of  xxxd2579xxx 
include modulation of inflammatory cytokine

of nf-b by modulating rela/p65 phosphorylation (9), and inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes (10).
however, despite these numerous experimental

remains unknown.

colon inflammation in ppar-/ mice is refractory to
 xxxd2579xxx  therapy
intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic
acid (tnbs) to male 129/sv mice provoked a severe colitis,
which represents a well-validated model that has many macroscopic and histologic similarities to human ibds (fig. 1 a)
(16–18). in nontreated animals killed 5 d after colitis induction, weight loss and severe macroscopic and histologic lesions that would have resulted in death were observed in
50% of mice (fig. 1). these lesions, characterized by large
areas of ulceration, necrosis, and a transparietal neutrophilic
infiltration, were scored by macroscopic and histologic evaluation as 5.2  0.8 and 2.6  1.2, respectively, according to
the multiparametric wallace and ameho criteria (19, 20).
the most clinically effective dosage of a controlled-release
 xxxd2579xxx  preparation given orally was investigated in these
conventional 129/sv mice by a detailed dose–response study
of dosages ranging from 50 mg/kg/d to 1,000 mg/kg/d (fig.
1, b–d). evolution of weight curves was similar in control
mice without colitis and mice receiving tnbs and treated
with  xxxd2579xxx  at 100, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg, but not with
 xxxd2579xxx  at 50 mg/kg (fig. 1 b). these data were used to
eliminate the  xxxd2579xxx  dosage of 50 mg/kg. because  xxxd2579xxx  at
100 mg/kg was the concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  closest to that used
to treat ibds in humans (21), and because the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2579xxx  on body-weight changes (fig. 1 b), mortality
rate (fig. 1 c), and macroscopic wallace scores (fig. 1 d)
were statistically similar for the dosages of 100, 500, and
1,000 mg/kg, we selected 100 mg/kg as the optimal concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  for the following study in ppar-/
mice. at this concentration of  xxxd2579xxx , improvements in
body-weight changes, mortality rate, and wallace scores
were similar those seen in the rosiglitazone-positive mice
(fig. 1, b–e). a significant decrease in colonic methyl peroxidase (mpo) and tnf- mrna concentrations used as
biological markers of inflammation paralleled this improve-

animals were killed 5 d later to evaluate the intensity of colitis. (b–d) a
detailed dose–response study was performed with oral  xxxd2579xxx  given daily

macroscopic wallace scores. (e and f) to evaluate whether the antiinflammatory role of  xxxd2579xxx  in the colon was mediated by ppar-, we compared
the antiinflammatory effects of the most efficient dosage of  xxxd2579xxx  in
wild-type mice (black) and in ppar/ mice (gray). in contrast with wildtype mice,  xxxd2579xxx  was ineffective in ppar/ mice and did not modify (e)

ment (fig. 1 f). to determine whether the antiinflammatory
effects of  xxxd2579xxx  in the colon were mediated by ppar-,
colitis was induced in 129/sv ppar-/ mice by intrarectal tnbs administration. compared with their wild-type
littermates, these heterozygous knockout mice had a mean
70  8% decrease of ppar- mrna levels in the colon.
as established previously (17), ppar-/ mice exhibited
more pronounced macroscopic/histologic lesions and higher
concentrations of biological markers of inflammation than
wild-type animals (fig. 1, e and f). in contrast with control
mice,  xxxd2579xxx  treatment did not affect the severity of tnbs
colitis in ppar-/ mice, as assessed by macroscopic or
histologic scores, colonic mpo, or tnf- concentrations
(fig. 1, e and f), indicating ppar- may have a major role
in mediating the antiinflammatory effect of  xxxd2579xxx .

ppar- plays an important role in the maintenance of mucosal integrity in the intestine (12). expressed at high levels in
the colonic epithelium, ppar- and its high-affinity synthetic ligands such as thiazolidinediones are involved in the
regulation of colon inflammation (12–15). based on the
common activities of  xxxd2579xxx  and ppar- ligands in colonic
epithelial cells, we hypothesized that ppar- may be the
molecular target of  xxxd2579xxx . in the present study, we report
that chemically induced colitis in mice heterozygous at the
ppar- locus (ppar-/) was refractory to  xxxd2579xxx  therapy. using the ht-29 colon epithelial cell line, we found
that  xxxd2579xxx  induced ppar- mrna and protein expression. furthermore, the ability of  xxxd2579xxx  to bind and activate
ppar- in different experimental settings including receptor
binding, transcriptional activation, and conformational changes
indicated that  xxxd2579xxx  exerts its effects in the colon through
direct ppar- activation.

such as 3t3-l1 cells (22). to evaluate the role of  xxxd2579xxx  as
a ppar- activator, we compared the effects of different
concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  and of the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone on confluent 3t3-l1 preadipocytes at day 8 after
confluence. optimal dosage of rosiglitazone (105 m) enhanced intracytosolic accumulation of lipid as monitored by
oil red o staining in 94  3% of cells (fig. 2). treatment
with  xxxd2579xxx  also induced a marked differentiation of preadipocytes in a dose-dependant manner leading to lipid accumulation in 98  1% of cells (fig. 2). lactate dehydrogenase
activity remained low and was not modified in the presence
of rosiglitazone or  xxxd2579xxx  (unpublished data), ensuring that
 xxxd2579xxx  did not exert a direct cytotoxic effect on 3t3-l1
cells. these data establish that  xxxd2579xxx  has an adipogenic capacity similar to that of rosiglitazone.

we also investigated ppar- transcriptional activity by
transient transfections (13). analysis of ppar- activity in
transfected ht-29 cells showed that  xxxd2579xxx  at 30 mm increased the reporter-gene activity by threefold, thereby displaying an activity similar to that of rosiglitazone (fig. 3 c).

induction and activation of ppar- expression in
 xxxd2579xxx –treated epithelial cells
experiments in cultured preadipocyte suggest that activation
of ppar- by rosiglitazone modestly increases the expression of this receptor in a positive-feedback loop (23, 24). we
then compared the capacity of  xxxd2579xxx  and of rosiglitazone to
induce ppar- expression at the mrna and protein levels
in the ht-29 cell line. a threefold induction of ppar-
mrna expression quantified by real-time pcr technique
was found in colonic epithelial cells treated for 12 h with
 xxxd2579xxx , 30 mm (fig. 3 a). western blot extended and
confirmed these results, showing a threefold induction of

binding of  xxxd2579xxx  to ppar- induces activation
activation of ppar- results in a cascade of reactions including translocation or redistribution of ppar- in the cell
nucleus (25, 26), conformational changes within ppar-
(27, 28), recruitment of coactivators, and binding to specific
dna sequence elements termed peroxisome-proliferator response elements (ppre) (29–31). the effects of  xxxd2579xxx –
bound ppar- were examined at these different steps.
intracellular localization of ppar- in epithelial cells has
not been characterized previously. in other cell types, distinct ppar- localizations have been observed (25, 26, 32).
using fluorescence microscopy to visualize the cellular distribution of a gfp-tagged ppar-, a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of the fluorescent label was found in
unstimulated ht-29 cells (fig. 4 a). this cytoplasmic
localization of ppar- in epithelial cells has been noted
previously ex vivo by immunohistochemistry in the colonic
epithelial cells of patients (13). exposure of epithelial cells to

mm) for 24 h resulted in a similar redistribution of gfptagged ppar- to the nucleus (fig. 4, a and b). the translocation of gfp-tagged ppar- from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus was also observed with rosiglitazone.
next, to evaluate the conformational changes induced by
the binding of  xxxd2579xxx  to ppar-, we performed a protease
protection assay of [35s]-ppar- bound to either  xxxd2579xxx  or
rosiglitazone. rosiglitazone binding did not lead to a radical
change in the proteolytic pattern as compared with  xxxd2579xxx 
(fig. 5). as previously described, rosiglitazone-positive con1208

 xxxd2579xxx  binding assay for ppar- and docking studies
the direct binding of  xxxd2579xxx  to ppar- was explored by
competitive ligand-binding assay using radioactive rosiglitazone. because rosiglitazone is located in the ligand-binding
pocket of the ppar- ligand-binding domain (lbd) in the
crystal structure of the complex (34), loss of rosiglitazone
binding would demonstrate that  xxxd2579xxx  displaces it. as previously described, in a competitive experiment the commercially available ppar- ligand gw1929 displaced
[3h]rosiglitazone used as positive control from the ppar-
lbd with a ki value of 60 nm (fig. 7 a and reference 35).
 xxxd2579xxx  also displaced [3h]rosiglitazone from the ppar-
lbd with a ki value of 28.7 mm (fig. 7 b). the concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  that caused 50% inhibition (ic50) of rosiglitazone binding was 15.2 mm. this ic50 of  xxxd2579xxx  corresponds
to the efficient  xxxd2579xxx  concentrations (1–50 mm) found in
vivo in treated patients (36, 37).
docking simulations were performed to predict the
binding mode of  xxxd2579xxx  into the active site of ppar- formerly occupied by rosiglitazone (38). one of the most stable docking models showed a binding mode of  xxxd2579xxx  similar to the crystal orientation of the thiazolidinedione head
group of rosiglitazone (fig. 8, a and b).  xxxd2579xxx  fitted

ppar- mrna expression was observed at 12 h in cells incubated with

for each condition in proportion to the quantity of the internal control
-actin in the same sample. (c) activation of ppar- by  xxxd2579xxx . ht-29
std cells transfected with the response element for ppar- (2xcyp) and
treated by  xxxd2579xxx  (30 mm) or rosiglitazone (10 5 m) showed a similar,
approximately threefold induction of ppar- reporter gene activity indicating the ability of  xxxd2579xxx  to induce ppar- activation. results are expressed as fold activation (mean  sem) compared with untreated cells.

 xxxd3105xxx  induced a conformational change in ppar- as assessed
by the generation of two protease-resistant bands following
partial chymotrypsin digestion of [35s]-ppar- (fig. 5 and
references 27, 28).  xxxd2579xxx  also generated protease-resistant
fragments different from those observed with rosiglitazone,
indicating that  xxxd2579xxx  induces structural transitions in ppar-
distinct from those induced by rosiglitazone.
recruitment of transcriptional coactivators plays a central role in mediating transcriptional activity of liganded
ppar-. among these coactivators, vitamin  xxxg657xxx –
interacting protein (drip)-205 is an important coactivator
interacting directly with ppar- (31, 33). to study the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  binding to ppar-, we examined whether
 xxxd2579xxx -bound ppar- can bind to drip-205.  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) pull-down assays with [35s]ppar- incubated with either  xxxd2579xxx  (1 and 5 mm) or
rosiglitazone and a gst-drip-205 fusion protein were
performed. the results clearly showed that, like the control
rosiglitazone,  xxxd2579xxx  was able to bind and to activate
ppar- resulting in an increased interaction between [35s]ppar- and gst-drip (fig. 6). the maximal efficacy of
 xxxd2579xxx  (5 mm) was 150% of that observed with rosiglitazone (105 m), suggesting that in these conditions the formation of ppar-–drip complexes was more pronounced
with  xxxd2579xxx  than with rosiglitazone.
taken together, these observations point to the productive binding of  xxxd2579xxx  to ppar-, inducing a coordinated
cascade of reactions leading to the translocation of ppar-
in the cell nucleus, a modification of its conformation permitting the recruitment of coactivators and activation of a
ppre-driven reporter gene.

which are considered key determinants for molecular recognition and ppar- activation (fig. 8, c and d, and references 34, 39). the phenolic hydroxyl group of  xxxd2579xxx  did
not interact with the receptor, but its orientation favored an
intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group as
shown in its crystal structure (40). superimpositions of our
 xxxd2579xxx  model to other known ppar- head group ligands
such as the ppar-–bound crystallographic conformations
of tesaglitazar (az242) (39) and farglitazar (gi262570) (38)

discussion
although  xxxd2579xxx  therapy has been widely used in patients
with ibd, the general mechanism underlying its antiinflammatory effects in the colon remain incompletely characterized. in the present study, we demonstrate that ppar- is
the key receptor for  xxxd2579xxx  that mediates its main effects in
the colon. this determination is based on multiple functional, pharmacological, and chemical lines of evidence and
was validated in vivo in a murine model of ibd and with
human clinical samples.
after oral or rectal administration into the colon, some
 xxxd2579xxx  is absorbed by colonic epithelial cells, but most remains
within the lumen and is passed in the stool (3–5). in ibd patients receiving standard  xxxd2579xxx  maintenance treatment, the
median mucosal concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  are 16 ng/mg,
ranging from 3 to 50 ng/mg of wet colonic tissues (2). the
therapeutic effect of  xxxd2579xxx  depends more on the direct contact of the molecule with the epithelium of the colon than on
the tissue concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  in the colon, indicating
that a high perimucosal concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  is a prereq-

uisite for its action. it has been previously reported in patients
conventionally treated with  xxxd2579xxx  that stool concentrations
of  xxxd2579xxx  are in the median order of 30 mm, ranging from
10 to 100 mm; these concentrations correspond to luminal
concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  100 times greater than the concentrations in the colonic mucosa (2, 7, 34, 42, 43). in vitro,
these millimolar concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  (1–50 mm) are
able to inhibit signal transduction (44), cell proliferation (45),
and expression of the  xxxg1578xxx  (46).
taken together, these data indicate that the  xxxd2579xxx  concentrations between 1 and 50 mm used in the present study are
clinically and biologically relevant and may be even below
the  xxxd2579xxx  concentrations found intraluminally in ibd patients receiving  xxxd2579xxx  maintenance treatment.
we have previously shown that ppar- is expressed at
the highest levels in adipose tissue and the colonic epithelium (12, 13, 47, 48). best characterized as a regulator of cellular metabolism and adipocyte differentiation, ppar- is
also capable of inhibiting the inflammatory response in several experimental models of colitis induced either by the administration of dextran sodium sulfate (14, 15) or 2, 4,
6-tnbs (17) and by ischemia-reperfusion (49). based on the
common antiinflammatory functions of  xxxd2579xxx  and ppar-
in epithelial cells and the high expression of ppar- by the
colon epithelial cells that  xxxd2579xxx  targets, we hypothesized
that  xxxd2579xxx  may be a new functional ligand of ppar-. using clinically relevant  xxxd2579xxx  concentrations (36, 37), we
showed by transfection studies using gfp-tagged ppar-,
a ppar-–sensitive reporter gene, protease protection assays, and gst pull-down assays that  xxxd2579xxx  is able to bind
ppar-, to induce its translocation from the cytosol of epithelial cells to the nucleus, to promote a ppar- conformational change, and to induce recruitment of a coactivator.
evidence supporting  xxxd2579xxx  as a direct functional agonist
of ppar- was obtained with a ligand-binding assay and by

using 3t3-l1 cells. ppar- is a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and this effect has been well demonstrated with the 3t3-l1 cells, which required ppar- activation for their differentiation (22). we showed that, like
the ppar- ligand rosiglitazone,  xxxd2579xxx  is an inducer of adipogenesis resulting in the conversion of 3t3-l1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. the relevance of these in vitro data
was further demonstrated in an experimental model of colitis
in mice treated with a controlled-release  xxxd2579xxx  preparation
developed to deliver the drug in the colon and to minimize
its systemic absorption in the proximal intestine (3–5). indeed, ppar-/ mice with colitis induced by intrarectal
administration of tnbs were completely refractory to
 xxxd2579xxx  preventive treatment, whereas the same dosage of
 xxxd2579xxx  given to wild-type mice with the same genetic background significantly attenuated the inflammatory response in
the colon. besides this therapeutic effect of  xxxd2579xxx  given
preventively, we and others have also shown that, after induction of colitis by dextran sodium sulfate or tnbs, administration of ppar- ligands is always effective in reducing lesion intensity and mortality compared with untreated
mice, despite destruction of the epithelial cell layer (14, 17).
the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of
ppar- ligands in established intestinal lesions remain partially unknown. it is possible that expression of ppar- in
the colon by immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes residing in the lamina propria may play a role (50,
51). because the spontaneous fluorescent properties of
 xxxd2579xxx  enable its localization in macrophages and lymphocytes of the lamina propria after oral or rectal administration
(52), we can hypothesize that during  xxxd2579xxx  administration,
ppar- expressed by macrophages and t cells may be activated in vivo and may induce antiinflammatory effects in the
gut, as previously described (15, 53).
regulation of ppar- expression in epithelial cells remains completely unknown. there is evidence that activation of ppar- by thiazolidinedione in preadipocytes can
increase modestly the expression of this receptor in a positive-feedback loop (23, 24). in ht-29 colonic epithelial
cells treated with  xxxd2579xxx , we observed a threefold induction
of ppar- expression at the mrna and protein levels.
these results obtained by quantitative real-time pcr paralleled those found in organ cultures of human colonic biopsies and by western blot analysis at the protein level in epithelial cell line. these data suggest that  xxxd2579xxx  is able to bind
and activate ppar- and also may enhance its expression.
this point is particularly important in patients with ulcerative colitis characterized by a chronic inflammation of the
colon in which ppar- expression is decreased in colonic
epithelial cells (13).
taken together, these data make a compelling case that
 xxxd2579xxx  is a novel ppar- agonist and show that ppar- is
the major functional receptor mediating the common
 xxxd2579xxx  activities in ibd. several x-ray studies of ppar-
crystal structures revealed the binding mode of synthetic

published april 11, 2005

ppar- agonists such as glitazones and glitazars in the lbd
of the receptor (38, 39). in our study, we identified  xxxd2579xxx 
as a new synthetic ppar- ligand interacting with the
lbd. because  xxxd2579xxx  was originally developed without any
knowledge of its molecular target, there is hope that the research described here will lead to the rational optimization
or development of better ppar- ligands. improvements in
efficacy may reside in a new compound with higher affinity
or an association of agents with additive or synergic effects
on the ppar-/retinoid x receptor (rxr) heterodimer.
studies are also in progress to evaluate if quantification of
ppar- expression in the intestinal mucosa of patients may
be a marker for monitoring therapeutic effectiveness of
 xxxd2579xxx . by analogy with glitazones or glitazars, other studies
should also be done to assess whether  xxxd2579xxx  could have
therapeutic effects in patients with metabolic disorders.

induction of tnbs colitis and study design. animal experiments
were performed in accredited establishments at the institut de génétique et
de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire in strasbourg (b59-108 and b 67–
218-5) and at the institut pasteur from lille (86/609/cee) according to
governmental guidelines. animals were housed five per cage and had free
access to standard mouse chow and tap water. for colitis induction, mice
were anesthetized for 90–120 min and received an intrarectal administration
of tnbs (40 l, 150 mg/kg) dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 0.9% nacl with
100% ethanol (13, 18). control mice received a 1:1 mixture of 0.9% nacl
with 100% ethanol or a saline solution using the same technique. animals
were killed 5 d after tnbs administration. the antiinflammatory effects of
 xxxd2579xxx  were evaluated by administration of different dosages of a controlled-release  xxxd2579xxx  preparation (50 mg/kg/d–1,000 mg/kg/d) and compared with the ppar- ligand rosiglitazone used at the optimal dosage of
20 mg/kg in 129/sv wild-type and ppar-/ mice (fig. 1 and reference
17).  xxxd2579xxx  was administered orally once daily, starting 2 d before colitis induction. body-weight changes and macroscopic and histological indications
of colitis were evaluated blindly by two investigators. the colon of each
mouse was examined under a dissecting microscope (at a magnification of 5)
to evaluate the macroscopic lesions according to the wallace criteria. the
wallace score rates macroscopic lesions on a scale from 0 to 10 based on
features reflecting inflammation, such as hyperemia, thickening of the
bowel, and extent of ulceration (19). a colon specimen located precisely 2
cm above the anal canal was used for histological evaluation according to
the ameho criteria (20). this grading on a scale from 0 to 6 takes into account the degree of inflammation infiltrate, the presence of erosion, ulceration, or necrosis, and the depth and surface extension of lesions. the other
parts of the colon were frozen and used to quantify ppar-, mpo, and
tnf- mrna levels (16, 17).
cell lines. 3t3-l1 preadipocytes (atcc cl-173) were grown to confluence in dme (invitrogen) with 10% fcs and antibiotics. the medium was
supplemented with 1 m dexamethasone, 0.2 mm isobutyl methyl xanthine, 10 g/ml insulin, and 10% fcs for 2 d (27). the effects of  xxxd2579xxx 
(104 m–102 m) on the differentiation of 3t3-l1 preadipocytes into adipocytes were compared with the effects of rosiglitazone (105 m) on confluent cells over 8 d. medium,  xxxd2579xxx , and rosiglitazone were changed every
2 d. cell viability was assessed by testing lactate dehydrogenase activity in
the culture medium taken during the course of the differentiation process or
on mature 3t3-l1 cells, treated or not with rosiglitazone and  xxxd2579xxx . adi1212

real-time mrna quantification. total rna was isolated from cells
and colonic tissues using rneasy kit (macherey nagel) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. rna quantification was performed using spectrophotometry. after treatment at 37 c for 30 min with 20–50 units of
rnase-free dnase i (roche diagnostics corp.), oligo-dt primers (roche
diagnostics corp.) were used to synthesize single-stranded cdna. mrnas
were quantified using sybr green master mix (applera corp.) with
specific mouse oligonucleotides: tnf-, forward, 5 -tgggagtagacaaggtacaaccc-3 , reverse, 5 -catcttctcaaaattcgagtgacaa-3 ; and human oligonucleotides: ppar-, forward, 5 -cctgataggccccactgtgt-3 , reverse, 5 -caggtgggagtggaacaat-3 and ngal, forward, 5 -ttcagggaggcccaaaga-3 , reverse, 5 -cctctacgggagaaccaagga-3 in a geneamp abiprism
7000 (applera corp.). in each assay, calibrated and no-template controls
were included. each sample was run in triplicate. sybr green dye intensity
was analyzed using the abiprism 7000 sds software (applera corp.). all
results were normalized to the unaffected housekeeping gene -actin:
mouse -actin, forward, 5 -gggtcagaaggattcctatg-3 , reverse,

evaluation of ppar, -actin, and mpo by western blot analysis.
total proteins were obtained by cell or colon homogenization in an extraction buffer consisting of pbs with 2% triton, 100 mm pmsf, and a classical
protease-inhibitor cocktail. total proteins were then separated by page
and electroblotted. polyvinylidendifluoride membranes were incubated
overnight with rabbit polyclonal primary antibody directed against ppar-
(dilution 1/500, tebu bio) or mpo (dilution 1/500; dakocytomation)
(13, 17). -actin was detected using a rabbit monoclonal primary antibody
diluted at 1/10,000 (sigma-aldrich). immunodetection with a swine secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1/1,000; dakocytomation) and
chemiluminescence were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol
(ecl, amersham biosciences). mpo results were expressed as units of od
per quantity of total protein. od values of ppar- were given for each
condition in proportion to the quantity of the internal control -actin in
the sample.
gfp-tagged ppar-. 1 g of gfp-tagged ppar- vector was transfected in ht-29 std cells using the effectene transfection reagent
(qiagen). after 24 h incubation, cells were treated with  xxxd2579xxx  (1 mm, 5
mm, or 30 mm) or with rosiglitazone (105 m) for 1 d. after two pbs
washes, cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde. nuclei were stained with
hoescht 33342 solution, 0.125 mg/ml (sigma-aldrich). slides were
mounted and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (leica).
protease digestion assay. [35s]methionine-labeled full-length human
ppar-2 was generated using transcription/translation system (promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 l of labeled ppar-2, diluted in binding buffer (10 mm hepes, ph 7.4; 100 mm kcl; 2 mm
dithiothreitol; 10% glycerol), was incubated with  xxxd2579xxx  (5 mm) or rosiglitazone (105 m) for 120 min at 4 c and submitted to chymotrypsin digestion as previously described (54). this high concentration of rosiglitazone
was used to ensure complete receptor saturation. different concentrations
of chymotrypsin (0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 u; sigma-aldrich) were added to the
mix for 30 min at 25 c. the reaction was terminated by the addition of 15

l of 3 denaturing gel loading buffer and by boiling for 1 min. proteolysis
products were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% sds-page gel.
after electrophoresis, gels were dried, and radioactivity was detected with a
storm 860 phosphoimager (molecular dynamics).
gst pull-down experiments. the protocol used has been published
elsewhere (55). in brief, 5–10 pmol (5 l) of [35s]-labeled human ppar-
was incubated with the indicated concentration of ligand in a 200- l final
volume. the binding buffer consisted of 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 150
mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% triton x-100. after 1 h incubation at 20 c,
40 l of gst-drip slurry was added to the mix and agitated slowly on a
rotating wheel for 90 min at 20 c. unbound material was removed by
three successive washes of sepharose beads by 10 volumes of 1 phosphatebuffered saline 0.1% triton x-100. resin-bound receptors were then resolved by sds-page on a 10% gel and detected by autoradiograph with a
storm 860 phosphoimager (molecular dynamics). the amount of ppar-
bound to coactivator in the presence of the indicated ligands was expressed
as fold-induction relative to that measured in the absence of ligand (defined
as 1). each sample was processed in duplicate.

competition binding assay for ppar-. ligand-binding assays were
processed as described previously (56). in brief, purified ppar-–lbd (invitrogen) was incubated at 4 c for 2–3 h in 100 l of buffer a (50 mm
tris, ph 8.0, 100 mm kcl, 100 g/ml ova, 0.3% ([3-cholamidopropyldimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), and 10 mm dithiothreitol) with
40 nm [3h]rosiglitazone in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled  xxxd2579xxx  (0–100 mm) or the known ppar- agonist gw1929
(0–800 nm, sigma-aldrich) used as positive control. 40 nm is the concentration of [3h]rosiglitazone usually required for competition experiments,
yielding a reversible 80% saturation of the receptor (27). bound radioactive
ligand was separated from free radioactive ligand by incubating samples for
10 min at 4 c with 50 l of a charcoal-dextran suspension (3% charcoal,
0.3% dextran in buffer a) and was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. each assay was performed in triplicate. ki values were calculated according to the equation of cheng and prusoff corresponding to ki ic50/
(1 [l]/kd) where l is the concentration of [3h]rosiglitazone (40 nm), and
the kd for rosiglitzone is 45 nm (57).
molecular modeling. molecular modeling studies were performed using
sybyl software version 6.9 (tripos associates inc.) running on silicon
graphics workstations. a three-dimensional model of the zwitterion form
of  xxxd2579xxx  was built from a standard fragments library, and its geometry was
subsequently optimized using the tripos force field (58) including the electrostatic term calculated from gasteiger and hückel atomic charges. powell’s method, available in maximin 2 (sybyl 6.9; tripos associates) procedure, was used for energy minimization until the gradient value was smaller

untreated patients operated on for crohn’s disease (n 3), ulcerative colitis
(n 3), or colon cancer (n 6). the study was approved by the local ethics committee. biopsies were immediately placed in hbss–calcium or
magnesium free supplemented with 100 iu/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin. after washing, biopsies were incubated in a humidified atmosphere for 1 d at 37 c in six-well tissue-culture plates containing 2 ml of
rpmi 1640 supplemented with 1, 30, or 50 mm  xxxd2579xxx  (61). supernatants

transient transfection with ppar- and stimulation of cells. ht29 std cells were transiently transfected using the effectene transfection
reagent (qiagen) according to instructions from the manufacturer. to
test ppar- activation, we performed transfection with 500 ng of a minimal promoter construct containing two copies of ppre obtained from the
cytochrome p450 4a (2xcyp) (13). the renilla luciferase plasmid (0.1 g/
well) was also transfected as an internal control for monitoring transfection
efficiency and for normalizing the firefly luciferase activity. transfected cells
were incubated for 48 h at 37 c. stimulations were performed for 6 h with
 xxxd2579xxx  30 mm or with the ppar- synthetic ligand rosiglitazone 105 m
used as positive control. total cell extracts were prepared using the passive
lysis buffer (promega). luciferase activity was assayed in 20 l of the extract using promega’s dual luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer’s protocol. transfections were assayed in triplicate in at least three
separate experiments. the luciferase activity was expressed as fold of the activity obtained in cells treated with  xxxd2579xxx  dividing by luciferase activity
from nonstimulated cells.

ing domain was obtained from its complexed x-ray crystal structure with
the rosiglitazone available in the research collaboratory for structural bioinformatics protein data bank (1fm6) (38). flexible docking of  xxxd2579xxx 
into the receptor active site was performed using gold software (cambridge crystallographic data centre; reference 59). the most stable docking models were selected according to the best-scored conformation predicted by the goldscore (59) and x-score scoring functions (60). the
complexes were energy-minimized using the powell method available in
maximin2 procedure with the tripos force field and a dielectric constant of
4.0 until the gradient value reached 0.01 kcal/mol å. the anneal function
was used to define a 10-å hot region and a 15-å region of interest around
the ligand.
