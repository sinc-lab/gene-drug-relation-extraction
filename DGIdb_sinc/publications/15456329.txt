abstract

 xxxd2688xxx  is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug, which exerts its
pharmacological effects via the metabolite 6-methoxy-2- xxxd1338xxx 
(6-mna).  xxxd2688xxx  itself is non-acidic and, following absorption, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the main circulating active metabolite (6-mna) which is a much more potent inhibitor of preferentially
cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2. the three major metabolic pathways of  xxxd2688xxx 
are o-demethylation, reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, and an oxidative
cleavage of the side-chain occurs to yield acetic acid derivatives. essentially no
unchanged  xxxd2688xxx  and <1% of the major 6-mna metabolite are excreted
unchanged in the urine from which 80% of the dose can be recovered and another
10% in faeces.
 xxxd2688xxx  is clinically used mainly for the management of patients with
osteoarthritis (oa) or rheumatoid arthritis (ra) to reduce pain and inflammation.
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx  has also been evaluated in patients with
 xxxg1055xxx , soft tissue injuries and juvenile ra.
the optimum oral dosage of  xxxd2688xxx  for oa patients is 1g once daily,
which is well tolerated. the therapeutic response is superior to placebo and
similar to nonselective cox inhibitors. in ra patients,  xxxd2688xxx  1g at bedtime
is optimal, but an additional 0.5–1g can be administered in the morning for
patients with persistent symptoms. in ra,  xxxd2688xxx  has shown a comparable
clinical efficacy to aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ), diclofenac,  xxxd2969xxx , ibuprofen
and naproxen.
clinical trials and a decade of worldwide safety data and long-term postmarketing surveillance studies show that  xxxd2688xxx  is generally well tolerated. the
most frequent adverse effects are those commonly seen with cox inhibitors,
which include diarrhoea, dyspepsia, headache, abdominal pain and nausea.
in common with other cox inhibitors,  xxxd2688xxx  may increase the risk of gi
perforations, ulcerations and bleedings (pubs). however, several studies show a
low incidence of pubs, and on a par with the numbers reported from studies with
cox-2 selective inhibitors and considerably lower than for nonselective cox
inhibitors. this has been attributed mainly to the non-acidic chemical properties
of  xxxd2688xxx  but also to its cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor profile. through its
metabolite 6-mna,  xxxd2688xxx  has a dose-related effect on platelet aggregation,
but no effect on bleeding time in clinical studies. furthermore, several short-term
studies have shown little to no effect on renal function.
compared with cox-2 selective inhibitors,  xxxd2688xxx  exhibits similar
anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in patients with arthritis and there is
no evidence of excess gi or other forms of complications to date.

 xxxd2688xxx  is one of the most commonly used
nsaids in the world today. the popularity of this
drug lies in both its unique pharmacokinetic profile
and special safety features in pharmacodynamic

terms. the recent introduction of selective cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors and their increasing
clinical use has led to a need for a comparative
overview of  xxxd2688xxx  versus the current array of
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

nsaids. hence, this article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic disposition, dosage recommendations, adverse effects, drug interactions and
efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx  in patients with selected
rheumatic disorders especially in comparison with
other nsaids.
medical literature dealing with  xxxd2688xxx  published in any language since 1983 was identified by
database searches in medline and embase. the
reference lists of published articles were used to
identify additional references. the company developing the drug supplemented bibliographical information, including contributory unpublished data on
request.[1]  xxxd2688xxx  and osteoarthritis (oa) or
rheumatoid arthritis (ra) were used as search terms
and searches were last updated january 2004. the
selection of studies included in this review was
based mainly on whether the methods section of the
trials described the inclusion of patients with oa
and ra. large, well controlled trials with appropriate statistical methodology were preferred when
available. studies with relevant pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic data were also included.
1. clinical pharmacology
of  xxxd2688xxx 
1.1 cyclo-oxygenase (cox) isoenzymes

cox has the structural features of a ‘housekeeping’ enzyme and its expression may also be regulated.[2-4] from the early suggestions that there appeared to be more than one form of cox,[5-7] genomic studies resulted in identification of a novel gene
that was highly homologous to the gene for the
original cox or cox-1.[8-10] this novel isoform
was termed cox-2. further research demonstrated
that cox-2 could be up-regulated by cytokines,
growth factors and tumour promoters.[8-12]
the expression of both cox-1 and cox-2 is
increased in inflammatory processes and in atherosclerotic plaques.[13,14] the catalytic activities and
tertiary structures of cox-1 and cox-2 are largely
similar,[15-17] but cox-2 has a broader affinity for
substrates because the hydrophobic channel leading
to the active site of this enzyme is larger. in early
research cox-1 was generally considered as a constitutive enzyme and cox-2 as an inducible enzyme

for prostanoid formation during different pathological conditions. however, later research has demonstrated that this is an oversimplification since
cox-2 may also act as a constitutive enzyme.
cox-1 and cox-2 are thus differentially expressed in different tissues during physiological and
various pathophysiological conditions, which are of
major relevance to the clinical effects of drugs inhibiting the different cox isoforms.
1.2 cox inhibitory properties
of  xxxd2688xxx 

 xxxd2688xxx  itself is a prodrug but, while the
parent compound is a weak cox inhibitor, the main
active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2- xxxd1338xxx 
(6-mna), strongly inhibits cox.[18-21] therefore, it
is important to note that the data regarding its
cox-2 preferential actions relates to 6-mna. several studies have investigated the cox-1/cox-2
selectivity of 6-mna. such studies over a wide
concentration range indicate that 6-mna is a
cox-2 preferential inhibitor.[22,23] moreover, comparative studies with other cox inhibitors using the
human enzyme have also reported preferential
cox-2 inhibition by 6-mna, though less pronounced. using purified human enzyme, barnett et
al.[22] found 6-mna to be approximately three to
five times more active on cox-2 than cox-1
(cox-2/cox-1 ratio 0.28), despite describing this
as ‘equiselectivity’. similarly, in another study, patrignani et al.[24] have also reported 6-mna to be
equipotent despite a cox-2/cox-1 ratio of 0.67. in
addition to these studies, laneuville et al.[23] did not
report any preferential selectivity of 6-mna for
cox-2, describing it to be a largely equipotent
inhibitor of both cox-1 and cox-2. however, also
in this study, 6-mna showed preferential activity
against cox-2 over the major part of the concentration range tested.[23]
however, it is now evident that estimates of
cox-2/cox-1 ratios in vitro of different cox inhibitors or nsaids cannot easily be translated into
comparative gastric, cardiovascular or renal tolerability in clinical practice. rather, collective evidence indicates that there are multiple pharmacological mechanisms involved in the events leading to
cox inhibitor-related gastropathy as well as cardiovascular or renal adverse events. the differences in

the tolerability profile of cox inhibitors appear to
be multifactorial and certainly more complex than
previously understood.[25-28]
several important factors have been identified for
stomach ulcer development. these include, for example, the low disassociation constant (pka) or
acidic nature of most cox inhibitors as well as their
ability to be absorbed in the stomach, which, together with biliary excretion, may result in vulnerability
during secondary exposure of the stomach to the
specific nsaid through a biliary reflux. such factors are not applicable for  xxxd2688xxx  since it is a
non-acidic prodrug that is poorly absorbed from the
stomach and is not subject to biliary reflux.[21,27-29]
although  xxxd2688xxx  itself has no irritant effect on
the gastric mucosa, the systemic effects of the active
metabolite 6-mna may, however, cause dyspepsia
and nausea.

2. pharmacokinetics
when taken orally,  xxxd2688xxx  is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract to the
presystemic circulation.  xxxd2688xxx  is almost
completely metabolised in the liver to produce a
range of metabolites (figure 1). one of these metabolites, 6-mna,[20,30] is the major pharmacologically active principle which accounts for the cox-1/
cox-2 inhibitory activity. 6-mna is the result of
oxidative cleavage of the side-chain on the parent
molecule. a number of additional metabolites are
produced by demethylation processes and by reduction of the ketone moiety to an alcohol. the active
6-mna metabolite is itself metabolised to
desmethyl-6-mna (figure 1), but this, as well as the
other metabolites of  xxxd2688xxx , appear to have
minimal pharmacological activity compared with
6-mna. therefore, the parent compound  xxxd2688xxx  can be considered to be a non-acidic prodrug to
6-mna.
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

2319

metabolism of orally administered  xxxd2688xxx 
occurs through three interrelated metabolic pathways:[30,31] o-demethylation, reduction of the ketone
to an alcohol and oxidative cleavage of the sidechain to yield acetic acid derivatives (figure 1 and
figure 2).
after oral administration, plasma concentrations
of unchanged  xxxd2688xxx  remain below the limit of
detection in most individuals. the mean absolute
bioavailability of the active metabolite 6-mna was
38% after oral administration of  xxxd2688xxx  in six
young healthy volunteers.[32-34]
after oral administration of a single  xxxd2688xxx 
dose of 1.0g to patients with ra or oa, peak
synovial fluid concentrations of the active 6-mna
metabolite range between 10 and 16 mg/l.[35] these
concentrations are generally reached between 4 and
12 hours after the first administration of the drug.
the active metabolite 6-mna has a volume of distribution of around 7.5 l/kg. essentially, no  xxxd2688xxx  is excreted unchanged in urine. both
free[30,31] and conjugated 6-mna, as well as its odemethylated metabolite are found in the urine (figure 1), but <1% of  xxxd2688xxx  reaches the urine as
the major active 6-mna metabolite.[33] two nonacidic urinary metabolites account for another 16%
of the dose. the remaining 45% is made up of
numerous minor inactive metabolites resulting from
further metabolism. taken together, 80% of the
administered dose of  xxxd2688xxx  is excreted in the
urine and approximately 10% in the faeces.[20,32,33]

several metabolites of  xxxd2688xxx  other than
6-mna have been found, mainly as conjugates in
the urine, although in minor amounts.
2.1 special populations
2.1.1 pregnancy and neonates

in animal studies, 6-mna crossed the placenta
barrier[36] and was excreted in breast milk. safety of
 xxxd2688xxx  during pregnancy and lactation has not
been established and, therefore, use is not recommended during this period.[36]
2.1.2 children

 xxxd2688xxx  has only been studied to a limited
extent in groups of children and, therefore, its use is
not recommended for children. however, in a recently performed open study in 99 patients with
juvenile ra (aged 2–16 years),  xxxd2688xxx  was
effective and safely used. the dose used was 30 mg/
kg/day.[37] these findings are supported by data
from two smaller studies including 10 and 15 patients with juvenile ra.[38,39]
2.1.3 elderly

in the elderly, administration of  xxxd2688xxx  results in higher plasma 6-mna concentrations compared with younger individuals.[20,40] however, this
pharmacokinetic observation appears to be clinically insignificant[20] when comparing younger and elderly patients in terms of efficacy and adverse effects.
therefore,  xxxd2688xxx  dosages are generally not
reduced when treating elderly patients.[32]
2.1.4 patients with liver and renal impairment

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2688xxx  have only
been studied to a limited extent in patients with liver
impairment. in a small study including patients with
cirrhosis,  xxxd2688xxx  pharmacokinetics were similar to that in healthy volunteers,[41] while in another
study[42] the excretion of 6-mna appeared to be
slightly delayed in the patients with liver dysfunction. therefore, dose reduction may be necessary
when treating patients with cirrhosis.
both  xxxd2688xxx  and its metabolites show a high
degree of protein binding. glucoronidised metabolites are excreted renally but plasma 6-mna concentrations are not altered during steady state in
patients with reduced renal function despite of the
fact that the renal elimination of 6-mna is reduced.
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

2320

this may be explained by a non-linear protein binding or that excretion may occur through other routes
of elimination. therefore, in practical terms the dose
of  xxxd2688xxx  need not to be adjusted in patients
with mild-to-moderate renal function.[43]
2.2 drug-drug interactions

the active 6-mna metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx  is
>99% protein bound and it may, therefore, potentially displace other highly protein-bound drugs.[35] although studies[44,45] have shown that coadministration of  xxxd2688xxx  with warfarin has no clinically
significant effect on coagulation parameters, a case
of abnormal bleeding complication has been reported.[46] therefore, concomitant administration with
warfarin and other anticoagulants should be undertaken with caution.
the following commonly available drugs do not
affect  xxxd2688xxx  metabolism and bioavailability:
paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ), cimetidine, and  xxxd131xxx 
antacids.[47]
there are several reports of interactions between
commonly used nonselective cox inhibitors as
well as cox-2 selective inhibitors and antihypertensive drugs.[48] so far, there have been no such
reports with  xxxd2688xxx .[49]
2.3 food-drug interactions

after oral  xxxd2688xxx , the bioavailability of
6-mna is largely unaffected by food. however, if
 xxxd2688xxx  is administered orally together with
milk, plasma 6-mna concentrations increase.[20,49]
absorption of  xxxd2688xxx  is not affected by
antacids, and alcohol (ethanol) does not appear to
alter the kinetics of the drug.[49]
3. therapeutic efficacy
similar to other cox inhibitors,  xxxd2688xxx  has
been shown to be effective in reducing pain and
inflammation in patients with oa, as well as pain,
inflammation and stiffness in patients with ra. furthermore, and like other cox inhibitors,  xxxd2688xxx  has not been shown to alter the progression of
the disease process.
therapeutic activity has been assessed in patients
with oa by symptom relief and analgesia. efficacy

parameters included physicians’ and patients’ global
assessment of disease activity, pain relief and improvement in the activities and lifestyle index.[50]
in a large number of oa studies  xxxd2688xxx  has
been compared with other traditional nsaids such
as aspirin, diclofenac,  xxxd2352xxx  (indomethacin)
and naproxen in standard dosages.[47]
in patients with ra,  xxxd2688xxx  has been compared with aspirin, as well as with a number of other
clinically available cox inhibitors. the parameters
used to assess therapeutic activity in such trials
commonly include the following: (i) ritchie articular index; (ii) severity of pain; (iii) physician and
patient global assessment of disease severity; (iv)
duration of morning stiffness; (v) time to walk 50
feet (15.2 metres); (vi) grip strength; and (vii) improvement in the activities and lifestyle index. in
addition, outcome parameters may also include need
for rescue analgesics and withdrawal rate for insufficient effect.[51]
in addition, a smaller number of studies are available in patients with juvenile ra,  xxxg1055xxx  and soft tissue injuries.

efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx  in oa were of short duration (2–8 weeks), but in four of the studies  xxxd2688xxx  and its reference treatments were given for
periods of up to 1 year or longer.[52-55] in two of
these early trials long-term  xxxd2688xxx  therapy was
compared with placebo. in both studies[52,53]  xxxd2688xxx  1g once and twice daily were statistically
and clinically superior to placebo. both treatment
regimens were well tolerated, although  xxxd2688xxx 
treatment was associated with more moderate adverse effects than placebo.
a 6-month, double-blind, controlled, randomised, parallel study of 40 patients compared the
efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2688xxx  (1g at bedtime) with naproxen (250mg twice daily) in the
treatment of oa.[54] the results indicated that  xxxd2688xxx  and naproxen have comparable efficacy and
tolerability at the dosage used. in another 6-month,
multicentre, double-blind study of 332 patients with
oa the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2688xxx  1g as a
single bedtime dose or aspirin 900mg in four dividdrugs 2004; 64 (20)

ed doses was compared.[55] the result demonstrated
that, at these dosages,  xxxd2688xxx  was as efficacious as aspirin and produced fewer adverse effects.
short-term studies comparing  xxxd2688xxx  with
traditional nsaids[47] have demonstrated similar
efficacy to the comparative agents. the trials compared  xxxd2688xxx  with other cox inhibitors such
as aspirin, diclofenac,  xxxd2352xxx  and naproxen
given in standard dosages.[47,50,51,56] in two studies
some patients withdrew because of an unsatisfactory
therapeutic effect of the 1 g/day dosage.[54,55] this
indicates that the optimum therapeutic dose range
may be between 1.0 and 2.0 g/day. in fact, in a
multicentre trial where 868 patients with oa received open-label  xxxd2688xxx  at individually titrated doses ranging between 1.0 and 2.0g for up to 8
years, 70% of patients maintained or even further
improved their initial response to therapy with
time.[57]
3.2 rheumatoid arthritis (ra)

cox inhibitor therapy represents one of the cornerstones in the treatment of patients with ra. no
formal dose-ranging studies have been performed
for  xxxd2688xxx  in ra patients but 1.0g once daily
in the evening remains the dosage schedule most
frequently used,[58,59] although in some long-term
ra studies, some patients required daily doses of
1.5–2.0g.[60]  xxxd2688xxx  administered as an evening dose is considered to be more effective than a
dose administered at other times of the day.[61]
 xxxd2688xxx  1.0 g/day or in the evening has an
analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in ra patients that is superior to placebo.[58,59] furthermore,
in comparative studies with other cox inhibitors,
 xxxd2688xxx  appears to be better or equally well
tolerated compared with most other cox inhibitors.[51,62] compared with aspirin,  xxxd2688xxx  produced fewer gi and cns complaints,[63] and compared with  xxxd2352xxx  or diclofenac[64-66]  xxxd2688xxx  produced fewer gi adverse effects. in an open
study of 1490 patients with ra or oa treated with
 xxxd2688xxx  for up to 8 years, the withdrawal rate
for lack of efficacy was 9.1% of patients.[57] in this
study two-thirds of the 622 patients with ra maintained or even further improved short-term benefits
during long-term  xxxd2688xxx  therapy.[57] a recent
open-label study in patients with juvenile ra dem© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

onstrated a safety profile with no loss of efficacy
compared with previous nsaid treatment.[67] ninety-nine patients aged 2–16 years were enrolled and
received  xxxd2688xxx  30 mg/kg once daily (as a
tablet or a slurry) for 12 weeks. the adverse event
profile was similar to that reported for  xxxd2688xxx 
in adults with ra.
3.3  xxxg1055xxx 

so far,  xxxd2688xxx  has only been evaluated in a
limited number of small studies in patients with
 xxxg1055xxx . in a double-blind, parallelgroup trial including 29 patients,  xxxd2688xxx  1.5 g/
day was slightly less effective than  xxxd2352xxx 
given in dosages of up to 175 mg/day.[68] in an
additional study, where 42 patients were receiving
 xxxd2688xxx  1g twice daily or  xxxd2352xxx  50mg
three times daily,  xxxd2688xxx  demonstrated comparable efficacy to  xxxd2352xxx . there was also a
similar profile of adverse events, although gi adverse effects appeared to be less frequent and less
severe with  xxxd2688xxx .[69]
3.4 juvenile ra

in a recent open study,  xxxd2688xxx  was assessed
in terms of safety and efficacy in patients with
juvenile ra aged 2–16 years.[37] the authors concluded from this trial in 99 patients that treatment
with  xxxd2688xxx  30 mg/kg/day was safe and effective. these findings are further supported by data
from two smaller studies including ten and 15 patients with juvenile ra.[38,39]
3.5 soft tissue injuries

studies in patients with soft tissue injuries, usually resulting from sporting accidents, seem to confirm that  xxxd2688xxx  is as effective as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.[70-74]
4. tolerability and safety
similarly to other cox inhibitors, safety issues
for  xxxd2688xxx  and 6-mna have been related to the
gi and renal systems, as well as the cardiovascular
system in relation to the platelet effects of
6-mna.[75-77]  xxxd2688xxx  has been extensively
evaluated regarding gi adverse events in comparative studies as well as in large prospective safety

evaluations.  xxxd2688xxx  therapy may cause salt
and water retention and, therefore, patients with
moderate or severe renal impairment may experience a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (gfr).
in platelets,  xxxd2688xxx  inhibits thromboxane a2
(txa2) production in a dose-dependent manner.
thus,  xxxd2688xxx  possesses anti-aggregatory
properties, but the antiplatelet effect is less than that
of naproxen and the bleeding time is not prolonged.[19,78]  xxxd2688xxx  has also been evaluated in
terms of its cardiovascular safety profile in patients
at increased risk for thromboembolic events, as well
as in patients at risk for heart failure and volume
retention.[77,79,80]
extended  xxxd2688xxx  safety data from both
premarketing clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance studies has been published,[76] summarising the safety of  xxxd2688xxx  in 44 953 patients
treated for periods between 3 weeks and 8 years.
this surveillance report revealed a low incidence of
serious gi, cardiovascular and renal adverse events
related to  xxxd2688xxx  therapy. furthermore, and
importantly, the data collected[76] revealed no reports of bone marrow suppression, liver necrosis,
serious cns conditions or life-threatening dermatological reactions. in addition, there was no increase
in toxicity in relation to increases in the dosage
within the therapeutic range of 1–2 g/day or in rela-

tion to age. withdrawal rates as a result of adverse
events were between 3% and 13%, and varied
among patients depending on the geographical location and duration of the treatment. as expected,
most withdrawals for adverse effects in  xxxd2688xxx 
treated patients occurred within the first year and
after that the withdrawal rate was reduced.
a recent study investigated the extent to which
 xxxd2688xxx  was tolerated by patients with verified
hypersensitivity to aspirin or nsaids.[81] twentyfour patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to aspirin or nsaids, which was verified by a physician,
on at least two occasions were enrolled. patients
were exposed to  xxxd2688xxx  1g orally and monitored for 4 hours, and further monitored after 3 and
12 months. twenty-two of the exposed patients did
not show any adverse reaction to  xxxd2688xxx . one
patient had urticaria and one had mild pruritus without objective signs, both of which resolved spontaneously. it should be noted that this was only single
exposure, no long-term treatment was commenced.
hence, these findings indicate the possibility that
 xxxd2688xxx  can be tried as an alternative in most
patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to commonly used nsaids.

4.1 upper gastrointestinal (gi) adverse
effects of cox inhibition

a major drawback associated with long-term use
of cox inhibitors relates to gi complications such
as perforation, ulcer or bleedings (pubs).[82] in general, the incidence of serious pubs due to long-term
cox inhibition by a variety of agents is about 2–4%
per year, but rates increase when specific risk factors
are present.[83,84]
the prevailing hypothesis that nonselective cox
inhibitors induce gi injury, primarily by inhibiting
the mucosal cox-1 isoenzyme, predicts that a
cox-1 selective inhibitor should be very toxic to
the gi mucosa and that cox-1 mice deficient in the
isozyme would be susceptible to spontaneous mucosal ulcer development and also more sensitive to
cox inhibition than their wild-type littermates.
however, this is not the case. furthermore, it has
been reported that a highly selective cox-1 agent
(sc-560) induces no gi injury in rats when administered alone, whereas gi toxicity develops when
given together with a cox-2 selective inhibitor.[85]
furthermore, langenbach et al.[86] reported that
cox-1-deficient animals had no detectable gi ulcer
disease and, if anything, were more resistant to
 xxxd2352xxx -induced ulcer development. to make
matters even more confusing, morham et al.[87]
found in a subsequent study that cox-2 knockout
mice were not viable, and developed peritonitis and
renal disease. the notion that cox-2 inhibition has
negative consequences is also supported by animal
studies indicating that ulcer healing in the proximal
and distal part of the gut was retarded in animals
treated with selective cox-2 antagonists.[88-91]
these findings demonstrate that the prevailing
concept, that cox-related gi mucosal injury is predominantly related to inhibition of mucosal cox-1
activity, needs to be reassessed since laboratory as
well as clinical studies demonstrate that the injurious actions of cox inhibitors are not always linked
to their ability to inhibit cox-1 in the gastric mucosa. thus, there is a possibility that these drugs may
cause injury of the gastric mucosa by mechanisms
other than cox inhibition. a rather strong case can
be made that nonspecific cox inhibitors induce gi

ulceration and bleeding primarily by topically injuring the mucosa, since they can enter the gi lumen
via oral intake, secretion into the bile or both. lichtenberger[92] has put forward the hypothesis that
zwitterionic phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) secreted into either the mucus gel layer or bile
may protect the gi epithelium from the toxic effects
of a variety of noxious agents such as hydrochloric
acid or bile salts present in the lumen. an alternative
hypothesis may, therefore, be that cox inhibitors
induce gi ulceration and bleeding by diminishing
the availability of phosphatidylcholine and related
phospholipids, which normally protects the gi
mucosa against a variety of luminal ulcerogenic
agents.
there is also evidence from clinical studies suggesting that mucosal cox inhibition may not be
directly involved in the pathogenesis of the enteropathy induced by cox inhibitors. in fact, several
studies in humans have reported that intravenous
administration of aspirin does not cause any detectable histological injury to the gastric mucosa, which
is in contrast to oral administration of the cox
inhibitor in the same dose range.[93,94] moreover,
after 2–4 weeks of cox inhibitor treatment, the
human gastric mucosa becomes resistant to the injurious actions of oral aspirin or  xxxd2352xxx . furthermore, this adaptive response was not linked to a
recovery of cox activity, which remained fully
blocked during the study period.[95,96]
various animal laboratory studies have compared the cox inhibitory efficacy and the gi toxicity of several cox inhibitors when given by different routes of administration (intragastric vs rectal or
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

2324

parenteral).[97,98] interestingly, such studies demonstrate that the gi damaging effect of several nonselective cox inhibitors, such as  xxxd3259xxx , ibuprofen and aspirin, was dependent on the intragastric
delivery of these drugs. this was evident despite the
fact that they all induced maximal mucosal cox
inhibition, regardless of the route of administration.
an interesting characteristic for some of the cox
inhibitors is that gi mucosal injury may also appear
when agents are administered systemically.  xxxd2352xxx , diclofenac or  xxxd2423xxx  are all secreted
into the bile and enter the enterohepatic transport
system.[99-101] from such data in animals it may be
demonstrated that there is a highly significant association between the percentage of the administered
dose of a cox inhibitor that is secreted into the bile
and the ability of the cox inhibitor to induce gi
ulceration.[99] further evidence supports the possibility that these drugs may induce topical injury to
the mucosa by being secreted into the bile. results
from a number of laboratories indicate that mucosal
injury which occurs with systemic administration of
cox inhibitors can be prevented by bile duct ligation.[100,101] also worth noting is the fact that some of
the animal studies that have demonstrated that systemic aspirin administration induces gastric injury,
purportedly by gastric cox inhibition, have been
performed exclusively on cats,[102-104] a species that
is highly sensitive to the gi toxic effects of aspirin.
thus, cox inhibitor-induced gi mucosal injury
is not easily explained, and an interesting case can
be made to investigate other mechanisms by which
cox inhibitors may induce gi mucosal injury. importantly, such information could be used to develop
alternative strategies to reduce or prevent the gi
toxicity of cox inhibitors. other potential targets of
cox inhibitor-related enteropathy may be related to
reduced mucosal blood flow and enhanced leucocyte adherence to the vascular wall,[105] uncoupling
of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,[106] induction of cellular acidification due to their protonophore characteristics,[107] or attenuation of the hydrophobic, non-wettable characteristics of the
mucosa, which would increase the susceptibility of
the tissue to luminal acid.
however, a number of questions remain about
the putative the role of cox-1 inhibition in the
pathogenesis of nsaid-induced gastropathy, and

hedner et al.

the potential influence of cox-2 inhibition in mucosal integrity and the ulcer healing process. the
initial and prevailing hypothesis states that nonselective cox inhibitors induce gi injury by inhibiting cox-1, which leads to a depletion of ‘cytoprotective’ prostaglandins in the mucosal tissue. indeed, there is considerable support for the concept
that nonselective cox inhibitors primarily induce
gi injury by inhibiting cox-1 activity of the gastric
mucosa.[103,108-113] several studies have demonstrated, in both animals and humans, that cox inhibitor-related gastroduodenal pubs are frequently
associated with a decrease in the mucosal prostaglandin content and/or cox activity. furthermore, the exogenous administration of prostaglandin analogues such as, for example, misoprostol can either partially or completely reverse the
deleterious effects of cox inhibitors on the gi
mucosa. however, such findings related to substitution therapy cannot be considered as definitive proof
since prostaglandin administration has a general
protective effect on the gi mucosa against a number
of damaging stimuli or conditions that do not cause
tissue prostaglandin depletion.[108,109]
although much debated, it is now evident that in
the clinical setting, cox-1-induced inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis does not entirely explain
nsaid-induced gastroduodenal toxicity. for example, mice lacking the cox-1 gene still develop
ulcers on cox inhibitor therapy.[86] furthermore, in
clinical studies, replacement of mucosal prostaglandin with misoprostol does not fully prevent
cox-related ulcer development.[113,114] in addition,
in patients with healed cox inhibitor-induced ulcers, 27% relapsed during 1 year of continuous
misoprostol treatment to prevent cox inhibitor ulcer recurrence.[114] from such examples, it is apparent that other factors are involved, which may also
be related to the multifunctional roles of cox-2 in
the gi mucosa. cox-2 is widely expressed in epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa at the margin of
ulcers. it seems to participate in epithelial regeneration,[89,115] which may be relevant to gastric ulcer
healing. as indicated by stenson,[116] inflammation
and wound healing are dependent on similar mechanisms and, therefore, drugs that inhibit inflammation may also retard gastric ulcer healing. however,
an effect of cox-2 inhibition on gastric ulcer healdrugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

ing may not be detectable in short-term gastric ulcer
studies. in studies extending over longer time periods, however, the effect might be evident because an
increased ulcer prevalence can result from either
induction of ulcers or delaying their spontaneous
healing. therefore, it is clear that only long-term
outcome studies correctly assessing gastric ulcer
incidence that compare cox-2-selective inhibitors
with other cox inhibitors such as  xxxd2688xxx  will
provide clinically useful data.
4.1.1 cox-1/cox-2 inhibition

the risk of developing severe gi adverse events
varies between patients as well as between cox
inhibitors. numerous epidemiological studies demonstrate that the use of cox inhibitors increases
the overall risk (expressed as the odds ratio [or]) of
peptic ulcer bleeding (or 2.7–3.3), perforation (or
5.9–6.1) and gi adverse event-related death (or
4.79–7.62).[117-121] among risk factors that predispose cox inhibitor users to a greater risk of developing a severe gi event are age >60 years (or
2.86), a history of ulcer or ulcer bleeding (or
4.76–9.5), high-dose or use of multiple cox inhibitors (or 4.0–23.3), concomitant corticosteroid therapy (or 1.83–4.4) and concomitant anticoagulation
therapy (or 2.1–16.0).[117-121] since gi safety has
been a major concern with the use of cox-1/cox-2
inhibitors for decades, many preparations have been
developed to minimise cox inhibitor-induced gi
adverse events by using different drug formulations,
including enteric coating or encapsulation[122] or by
offering different routes of administration.[123] unfortunately, none of these approaches have reduced
the occurrence of long-term gi ulcer complications
to any major extent.[117-121]
4.1.2  xxxd2688xxx 

from a mechanistic point of view,  xxxd2688xxx 
has several pharmacological properties that may
contribute to its low gi toxicity. such beneficial
properties include the nonacidic prodrug formulation, lack of enterohepatic recirculation and possibly
a preferential inhibition of cox-2.[124,125] these
properties reduce the direct influence of  xxxd2688xxx  and its metabolite 6-mna on the gi mucosa
and minimise the risk of mucosal injury caused by
the agent.[126] interestingly, early studies evaluating
the effect of  xxxd2688xxx  on gi blood loss with
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

2325

51cr-tagged red blood cells did not show any significant difference in faecal blood loss between  xxxd2688xxx  1g given at bedtime and placebo, whereas
aspirin 3.6 g/day caused substantial gi microbleeding.[127] the likely explanation for this is that longterm use of  xxxd2688xxx , in contrast to conventional
nonselective cox-inhibitors, did not cause intestinal inflammation or mucosal injury, and further that
intestinal permeability remained normal.[128]
although cox-related damage to the upper gi
tract has been extensively investigated, small bowel
adverse events are less studied reflecting the relative
inaccessibility of that part of the gi tract for endoscopic studies. new techniques for investigating the
small bowel are emerging including increased use of
enteroscopy and the recently described wireless endoscopic capsule that produce endoscopic images of
the entire small intestine.[129] these techniques will
focus on the cox-related enteropathies in the future. however, different approaches including intestinal permeability assessment, enteroscopy, markers
of inflammation in the stools, surgery and postmortem studies have been undertaken. the rate of
small bowel damage related to nonselective cox
inhibitors differs (8–65%) according to which diagnostic methods are used. the highest prevalence is
found using the faecal markers.[130] whether the
highly selective cox-2-inhibitors are associated
with small bowel damage needs to be further studied.
 xxxd2688xxx  use seems to be less related to these
enteropathies than other nonselective cox inhibitors. in patients with ra the intestinal permeability
measured with 51credta was unchanged during
treatment with  xxxd2688xxx  1 g/day compared with a
significant increase of permeability during treatment
with  xxxd2352xxx  150 mg/day.[131] because  xxxd2688xxx , in contrast to  xxxd2352xxx , is a prodrug it is a
poor inhibitor of the prostaglandin synthesis until it
is converted to its active form. therefore,  xxxd2688xxx  would have little effect on the mucosa during
the absorption phase and as, in contrast to most other
cox inhibitors, it is not secreted into the bile, it
would have little effect via this route. the difference
between  xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd2352xxx  suggests that
cox inhibitors cause small bowel damage during
absorption or after biliary excretion, and that systemic effects are less important.

drugs 2004; 64 (20)

2326

lichtenberger[92] has recently provided an explanation as to how cox inhibitors secreted into the
bile possibly induce gi injury. biliary phosphatidylcholine plays an important role in intestinal mixed
micelle formation, which reduces the cytotoxic effects of bile salts. phosphatidylcholine can protect
rats from a number of ulcerogenic agents including
nsaids. there is also evidence that cox inhibitors
have a strong ability to chemically associate with
phosphatidylcholine, which transforms the mixed
micelles into cytotoxic bile salt micelles.[92] since
 xxxd2688xxx  is not secreted into the bile, it should
not be affected by this interaction with phosphatidylcholine.
individual studies have suggested that  xxxd2688xxx  has a safety profile which is superior to comparator nsaids as expressed by pubs, especially in
long-term studies.[47,76] the cumulative incidence of
 xxxd2688xxx -induced pubs in the early premarketing and postmarketing studies varied from 0.02% to
0.95%. the low incidence of pubs observed in
those surveys in the  xxxd2688xxx -treated patients
may be due to patient selection as well as the fact
that  xxxd2688xxx  is a prodrug. when administered to
patients, the conversion of the inactive parent drug
( xxxd2688xxx ) to the active 6-mna metabolite takes
place after absorption. thus, the non-acidic structure of  xxxd2688xxx , the fact that it does not inhibit
cox until after conversion to 6-mna and the lack
of enterohepatic circulation[28,132] may be important
explanations to the low incidences of pubs reported
after  xxxd2688xxx  therapy.
the early  xxxd2688xxx  studies including 1677
patients with ra or oa showed that there were 17
patients who developed ulcers, although the majority were regarded as being uncomplicated.[133] a
kaplan-meier life table analysis from this  xxxd2688xxx -treated cohort showed that the nabumetoneassociated risk of ulcer formation was 0.3% (95% ci
0, 0.6) at 6 months; 0.5% (0.1, 0.9) at 1 year; 0.8%
(0.3, 1.3) at 2 years; and 2.35% (1.1, 3.59) at 6 years.
expressed as a yearly incidence over the 6 years, the
mean calculated ulcer development rate was approximately 0.4% per year, with the upper 95% confidence limit being 0.6% per year. moreover, and as
shown in figure 5, the cumulative life table rate of
ulcer formation in  xxxd2688xxx -treated patients is
essentially linear over 5 years, which allows the

hedner et al.

event rate to be expressed in terms of events per 100
patient-years of  xxxd2688xxx  exposure. of the 17
ulcers related to  xxxd2688xxx , there were only four
clinically significant bleeding episodes and no perforations, providing an incidence a rate of complicated pub events of only 0.1 per 100 patient-years.
4.1.3  xxxd2688xxx  versus other cox inhibitors

the comparative gi safety of  xxxd2688xxx  has
been evaluated in a meta-analysis of randomised
trials which compared the gi safety of  xxxd2688xxx 
with other cox inhibitors in patients with ra or
oa. the 4411 patients assessed in these trials were
randomised to either  xxxd2688xxx  or a comparator
cox inhibitor such as diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen or  xxxd2969xxx . patients were given recommended
starting dosages of their respective medication, and
the investigator increased these dosages, depending
on clinical response and tolerability. notably, only
one ulcer occurred in the 3287 patients in the  xxxd2688xxx  group (681 patient-years), whereas six ulcers occurred in the 1077 patients receiving the
reference cox inhibitor therapy (221 patientyears). there was a significant difference between
the  xxxd2688xxx  and reference cox inhibitor strategies, whether based on cumulative incidence
(kaplan-meier life table) or events per 100 patientyears of exposure[133] (figure 5).
huang et al.[75] evaluated the difference in gi
adverse events, such as the rate of pubs, in comparative trials of  xxxd2688xxx  and conventional cox-1/
cox-2 inhibitors. this meta-analysis identified 13
studies consisting of 29 treatment arms and 49 501
patients that met the criteria predefined in the protocol. tests for heterogeneity found no significant
difference between the individual studies included
in the meta-analysis. overall, dyspeptic symptoms
of flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea were the
most commonly reported adverse events, accounting for 98.6% of the total gi adverse events. significantly more patients treated with comparator nonselective cox inhibitors experienced gi adverse
events compared with patients treated with  xxxd2688xxx  (p = 0.007). in fact, after adjustment for patient-exposure years, pubs were 10 to 36 times
more likely to develop in patients treated with a
comparator nonselective cox inhibitor than with
 xxxd2688xxx .

interestingly, the meta-analysis of the incidence
of ulcers and ulcer complications associated with the
therapeutic use of  xxxd2688xxx  by huang et al.[75]
suggests that the gi and other safety of this agent is
superior to that of nonselective comparator cox
inhibitors. this was a consistent finding in patients
participating in non-endoscopic (n = 7468) as well
as endoscopic studies (n = 244). furthermore, in
postmarketing or open-label studies of  xxxd2688xxx 
there was only one pub reported per 500 patientexposure years over 17 502 treatment years
(n = 39 389). moreover, gi adverse event-related
study withdrawals and hospitalisations were 1.3and 3.7-fold higher in patients treated with a comparator cox inhibitor compared with  xxxd2688xxx ,
respectively.[47]
in addition to the direct comparative studies and
meta-analyses, the incidence of pubs with  xxxd2688xxx  has been assessed and compared with other
cox inhibitors in database studies.[75,134-137] two
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

large database studies have compared the rates of gi
events occurring during treatment with  xxxd2688xxx 
and a variety of other cox inhibitors. in both studies the lowest rates of gi complications were observed in  xxxd2688xxx  treated patients.[134,136,137]
the tayside medicines monitoring unit
study[134,136] provided data for the rate of upper gi
toxicity in 53 293 patients aged ≥50 years receiving
cox inhibitors during the 3-year period from 1
january 1989 to 31 december 1991 compared with
73 792 subjects who did not receive a cox inhibitor
during the same period. in the study groups, 382
ulcers or complications (163 ulcers or erosions and
219 complications) occurred during 29 700 patientyears of cox inhibitor exposure, that is, a rate of
1.29 per 100 patient-years. in the reference group,
there were 1005 events (495 ulcers or erosions and
510 complications) during 220 540 years of followup, that is, an incidence rate of 0.46 per 100 patientyears. interestingly, the point estimate for nabumedrugs 2004; 64 (20)

2328

tone was the lowest within the group, which is
consistent with the experience from the  xxxd2688xxx 
clinical trials’ data.
in another large study, the aramis (arthritis,
rheumatism, and aging medical information system) database was surveyed[137] providing data on
3883 patients with ra, including cox inhibitor
treatment and complication rates. data have been
collected from 1976 and the study is still ongoing. in
this large cohort,  xxxd2688xxx  had the lowest absolute rate of hospitalisation for pubs among all cox
inhibitors surveyed, which is consistent with the
results achieved in the early controlled trials for this
agent.
an important rationale for the development of
cox-2 inhibitors, that is, the premise that they
would cause fewer gi adverse effects than available
nonselective cox inhibitors, seems unlikely to
apply to  xxxd2688xxx , which has the lowest incidence of gi toxicities among the agents. the incidence of 0.4% gi ulcers and 0.1% serious complications for  xxxd2688xxx  (e.g. gi perforations or bleeds)
is approximately one-tenth of that for the comparator nonselective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors and constitutes the current standard of comparison for the
cox-2 inhibitors.
4.2 platelet effects of cox inhibition

over the past few decades, multiple clinical evidence has emerged on the antithrombotic effect of
aspirin in cerebrovascular and coronary disease.[138]
txa2 is generated and released by platelets in response to a number of stimuli such as collagen,
thrombin and  xxxd80xxx  (adp). these
events may result in irreversible platelet aggregation
and vascular contraction. in this sense, txa2 enhances the ability of platelets to react with an aggregatory response to a number of diverse stimuli. by
this mechanism, platelet-derived txa2 may initiate
sequences of biological responses resulting in an
occlusive thrombotic disease event.[139]
ra patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular events.[140] thus, it is of major importance
in any therapeutic regimen to evaluate and consider
effects on platelet function.

4.2.1 cox-1 and cox-1/cox-2 inhibition

the cox-1 isoform of cox, which is produced
in human platelets,[141,142] has been crystallised[143]
and the structural basis of enzyme inhibition by
aspirin[15] as well as traditional cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors[144] has been elucidated. the aspirin- and the
cox inhibitor-binding sites both lie within a narrow
hydrophobic channel within the core of the
enzyme.[144] thus, there may be a structural basis for
a competitive interaction between aspirin and other
cox inhibitors, which is also supported by evidence from recent studies.[145]
txa2 is the predominant product of cox in
platelets.[146] the anucleate platelet represents a
unique target for aspirin because once cox is acetylated by aspirin, substrate access to the active site of
the enzyme is blocked for the remaining lifespan of
the platelet. thus, normal and continuous txa2
formation requires new platelets, which are formed
at a daily rate of approximately 10%.[147,148] the
only isoform of cox in platelets is cox-1.[148]
aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cox-1 by acetylating the amino acid serine in position 529 within
the active site of the cox-1 enzyme, which results
in a reduced production of txa2.[141] aspirin also
irreversibly inhibits the inducible cox-2 enzyme in
a similar way. the platelet cox-1 inhibitory
properties of aspirin have been evaluated in vitro by
analysing the amount of txb2 generated during
blood coagulation, that is, analysis of serum txb2,
which is a stable metabolite of txa2. single doses
of aspirin 5–100mg dose-dependently inhibit platelet cox-1 and a dose of 100mg induces an almost
complete inhibition of platelet cox-1, that is an
almost total inhibition txa2 generation. this inhibitory effect has been studied in healthy volunteers[149]
and in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease.[150] the effect is very rapid and present before
aspirin enters the systemic circulation. thus, the
therapeutic effect of aspirin is probably the result of
an acetylation of platelet cox-1 already in the
presystemic portal circulation. moreover, and as a
result of the irreversible effect of aspirin on cox-1,
when the daily intake of aspirin is stopped, the cox
activity in the platelets will very slowly resume full
activity. this process is dependent on de novo generation of platelets from the bone marrow and their
appearance in the circulation.[151] because of the
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

irreversible nature of the aspirin-induced platelet
cox-1 inhibition, the inhibitory effect of aspirin
doses <100mg is cumulative.[148,149] administration
of aspirin 30–50 mg/day will result in an almost
complete blockade of platelet cox-1 after approximately 7–10 days, resulting in a maximal inhibition
of thromboxane-dependent platelet aggregation as
well as a slight to intermediate prolongation of
bleeding time.[152,153] biochemical,[154] pharmacological[155] and clinical studies[156] unanimously support the concept that aspirin-induced inhibition of
platelet cox-1 is the mechanism that is mainly
responsible for its antithrombotic effect.
the irreversible blockade of cox-1 and cox-2
is specific for aspirin, while other cox inhibitors
induce reversible and dose-dependent blockade of
these enzymes. most cox inhibitors, which have no
distinct cox-1/cox-2 selectivity inhibit both isoenzymes to a similar and clinically significant extent. the clinical consequences of the different
platelet inhibitory properties of cox-2 selective
agents compared with the nonselective cox-1/
cox-2 inhibitors have been considerably debated
during recent years.[157-159]
in light of these novel findings on the putative
role of cox-2 related to platelet-vessel wall interactions, the question has been raised as to whether or
not cox-2-specific inhibitors confer an increased
risk of arterial thrombosis. looking at the current
evidence, the majority of the early efficacy studies
of cox-2 inhibitors in arthritis patients were of
short duration, and not designed or powered to reveal an altered incidence of arterial thrombotic
events (e.g. cardiovascular events). however, in
some recent large studies examining the efficacy
and safety profiles of the cox-2-selective inhibitors
celecoxib and rofecoxib, sufficiently large numbers
of patients were included allowing for an analysis of
cardiovascular outcomes.[160,161]
four large outcomes studies (vigor [vioxx
gastrointestinal outcomes research],[160,162,163] advantage [assessment of difference between
vioxx and naproxen to ascertain gastrointestinal
tolerability and effectiveness] trial,[164] class
[celecoxib long-term arthritis safety study][161-163]
and success [the successive celecoxib efficacy
and safety studies]),[165,166] examined the gi and
overall safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib compared

2329

with established cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors (naproxen, ibuprofen or diclofenac) in >39 000 patients
with oa or ra. some data from these trials may
indicate that patients taking cox-2 inhibitors
(rofecoxib or celecoxib) had lower rates of pubs
compared with the reference cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors naproxen, ibuprofen or diclofenac. however,
more debated has been the fact that the vigor trial,
where patients were not allowed low-dose aspirin,
showed a significantly increased occurrence of severe adverse events, preferentially related to cardiovascular and thrombotic endpoints. one potential
explanation behind this could be the lack of platelet
inhibitory effects of the cox-2 inhibitor in comparison with the reference therapy, the cox-1/cox-2
inhibitor naproxen.
4.2.2  xxxd2688xxx 

cipollone and coworkers[167] studied the effect of
 xxxd2688xxx  0.5–1 g/day on prostaglandin synthesis
in nine healthy volunteers.[167] platelet cox-1 activity was investigated by determination of serum
txb2 at steady state during day 7, and there was a
dose-dependent 50–70% inhibition of txb2 metabolites and serum txb2. after cessation of 7-day  xxxd2688xxx  treatment, serum txb2 was normalised at a
rate that corresponded to the half-life of the active
 xxxd2688xxx  metabolite 6-mna. the authors concluded that  xxxd2688xxx  inhibited platelet cox-1dependent txa2 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner.[167] several cox inhibitors ( xxxd2352xxx , naproxen, 6-mna and  xxxd2688xxx ) were investigated
by jeremy and coworkers[168] by assessing their effects on platelet aggregation and txa2 synthesis. in
their work, platelet aggregation and txa2 generation was inhibited in the following sequence;  xxxd2352xxx  > naproxen > 6-mna >  xxxd2688xxx .
from these results it was also concluded that 6mna effectively inhibits platelet prostaglandin synthesis, as opposed to the prodrug  xxxd2688xxx ,
which did not demonstrate any platelet inhibitory
properties in its own right.[168]
the effect of  xxxd2688xxx  on platelet activity was
studied by nunn and chamberlain[78] in six healthy
volunteers and compared with the effect elicited by
naproxen.  xxxd2688xxx  had a demonstrable inhibitory effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

2330

and the ‘second wave’ effect by adp-induced aggregation.[78]
jennings et al.[46] studied the effect of  xxxd2688xxx  in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery.
there was no difference in bleeding time between
the 15 patients who were randomised to  xxxd2688xxx 
1 g/day and the 15 randomised to placebo. in addition, the results from a study where arthroscopic
knee surgery was performed[169] showed that  xxxd2688xxx  had little or no effect on haemostasis and it
was suggested that this drug could be used safely in
the perioperative setting.
however, in slight contrast to these data, giuliano and coworkers[170] used an in vitro system to
evaluate the cox-1 and cox-2 antagonising effect
in plasma from healthy volunteers after intake of
different cox inhibitors such  xxxd2065xxx  200 or
400mg twice daily,  xxxd2561xxx  7.5 or 15 mg/day,
 xxxd2688xxx  0.5 or 1g twice daily, nimesulid 100 or
200mg twice daily or naproxen 500mg twice
daily.[170] the plasma from  xxxd2065xxx -treated patients
demonstrated a slight cox-2 preferential effect.
this cox-2 preference was more pronounced after
intake of  xxxd2561xxx  or nimesulid. the plasma from
 xxxd2688xxx -treated patients, however, showed no
or slight preference for cox-1 and naproxen had a
greater effect on cox-1 compared with cox-2.[170]
regarding  xxxd2688xxx  and its active metabolite
6-mna, it is clear that there is a significant effect on
cox-1 resulting in a platelet inhibitory effect as
shown by reduced aggregatory activity in vitro and
reduced txa2 synthesis. thus, it is reasonable to
conclude that  xxxd2688xxx  in such test systems appears as a cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor.[170] furthermore, it is difficult to make a reasonable comparison
from available in vitro data of the capacity of the
different cox inhibitors to block cox-1 and inhibit
platelet txa2 production in vivo. it is likely that a
single dose of aspirin 100mg as well as aspirin
30–75 mg/day for 1 week both induce a more effective platelet cox-1 inhibition than a therapeutic
dose of  xxxd2688xxx . proper comparative studies
have not yet been performed, but based on current
evidence it would not be surprising if such studies
should demonstrate a largely similar inhibitory effect on platelet cox-1 of the two agents.

hedner et al.

4.2.3 cox-2 inhibitors

leese and coworkers[171] investigated the effect
of a supratherapeutic dose of celecoxib 600mg twice
daily compared with a standard dose of naproxen
500mg twice daily in 24 healthy volunteers. platelet
activity was evaluated by bleeding time, aggregometry and serum txb2. the study demonstrated that even at these high doses, celecoxib did not
interfere with normal platelet activity, providing
evidence for a high degree of cox-2 selectivity for
celecoxib and consequently the lack of platelet effects of such therapy.[171]
the results from the recent vigor study have
led investigators to speculate whether naproxen has
a cardioprotective effect.[160,162,163] if such an effect
is present during naproxen therapy, a similar effect
should also be present after long-term  xxxd2688xxx 
treatment since the two agents seem to inhibit platelet cox-1 to a similar extent.[20,21] however, such
an effect is not present with the selective cox-2
inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib.
hennan et al.[172] studied the effect of aspirin and
celecoxib on thrombogenic mechanisms experimentally in the dog. mechanisms of coronary thrombosis and coronary vasodilatation were investigated in
their experimental model. the authors found that
celecoxib counteracted the anti-thrombotic preventive effect of aspirin. moreover, celecoxib inhibited
 xxxd208xxx -induced vasodilatation in coronary
arteries, which led the authors to conclude that: “the
results indicate important physiological roles for
cox-2-derived prostacyclin and raises concerns regarding an increased risk of acute vascular events in
patients receiving cox-2 inhibitors. the risk may
be increased in individuals with underlying inflammatory disorders, including coronary artery disease”.[172]
in another recent work by konstam et al.[173] a
pooled analysis was made of all studies with the
cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib regarding antiplatelet
trialists’ collaboration adverse events (cardiovascular death, death from bleeding, sudden death,
nonfatal myocardial infarction [mi] and nonfatal
stroke).[173] the authors stated that: “this analysis
provides no evidence for an excess of [cardiovascular] events for rofecoxib relative to either placebo or the non-naproxen cox inhibitors that were
studied. differences observed between rofecoxib
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

and naproxen are likely to be the results of the
antiplatelet effects of the latter agent”. there have
been several comments on this work, emphasising
that alternative interpretations are possible. also,
from a methodological point of view, this is a retrospective meta-analysis pooling different patient
groups. for example, results from 6-week studies
were mixed with studies of 15 months’ and 4 years’
duration. in addition, studies were mixed regarding
when aspirin was and was not allowed.[173]
in a recent, very interesting study, catella-lawson and coworkers[145] found that ibuprofen inhibited the irreversible acetylation of platelet cox-1
induced by aspirin. such an effect was not present
for celecoxib.[145] the authors concluded that in
order to obtain a cardioprotective effect, aspirin
should be taken 2 hours before ibuprofen and that
ibuprofen by itself could reduce the cardiac protective effect by aspirin if this interaction is not considered. thus, given these results, there are reasons to
perform detailed studies on platelet cox-1 acetylation for a number of cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors as
well as selective cox-2 inhibitors when combined
with aspirin.[145,174] van solingen et al.[175] studied
the effect of  xxxd2423xxx  200 mg/day with and without coadministration of  xxxd234xxx /day on platelet aggregation as well as serum txb2.[175] after a
daily intake during 1 week,  xxxd2423xxx  alone reduced serum txb2 by 85% compared with an 84%
reduction during concomitant medication with  xxxd2423xxx  and aspirin.[175]
taken together, the current clinical data are relatively consistent regarding the effect of highly selective cox-2 inhibitors on platelets, of which there
are few. however, it remains unclear what impact
the platelet effects of the cox inhibitors may have
on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. clearly,
several studies on nonselective cox-inhibitors demonstrate cardioprotective effects, while other studies on selective cox-2 inhibitors have shown an
interference with the cardioprotective effects of
nonselective cox-inhibitors.
4.3 cardiovascular adverse effects of
cox inhibition

as discussed in section 4.2, cox-2 inhibitors

cardioprotective effects. the potential of cox-2

inhibitors to increase the risk of cardiovascular
events in patients with arthritis/musculoskeletal pain
has emerged as a major concern in comparison with
treatment with conventional cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors.[157] the reasons for this concern are that any
beneficial effects of the selective cox-2 inhibitors
related to gi safety could potentially be outweighed
by this potential increased cardiovascular risk of
these novel agents or indeed compared with the
cardioprotective effects of aspirin or several conventional nonselective cox inhibitors.
4.3.1 cox-1/cox-2 inhibition

aspirin has been shown to be effective in the
secondary prevention of vascular disease in hypertensive patients.[176] however, the effectiveness of
traditional cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors in this respect
is largely unknown, since prospective, controlled
trials are, as yet, limited.[177,178] data from an initial
case-control analysis may suggest that cox-1/
cox-2 inhibitors may not reduce the risk of a first
mi.[179] cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors, unlike aspirin,
bind in a reversible manner to the active site of the
cox enzyme, usually depressing cox-1-dependent platelet thromboxane formation to the degree
that platelet function is inhibited only for a portion
of the dose administration interval.[180]
according to current dogma, cox-1 is constitutively expressed in cultured endothelial and vascular
smooth-muscle cells while the expression of cox-2
is increased by a number of agents, such as cytokines, growth factors, phorbol esters and lipopolysaccharide in endothelial and vascular smooth
muscle cells, and by injury to the vasculature. on the
basis of these observations it has been suggested that
cox-2 is involved in the increase of prostacyclin
formation during clinical syndromes related to
platelet activation.[181] cox-2, as well as cox-1,
expression is upregulated in foam cells and smoothmuscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques.[14] cox-2
inhibitors decrease urinary excretion of prostacyclin
metabolites in healthy individuals, [182,183] which is
indicative of a decreased prostacyclin production.[184] an important function of cox-2 in endothelial cells is that laminar shear forces increase
prostacyclin expression in vitro[185] and may do so
also in endothelial cells in healthy individuals.[183]
therefore, prostacyclin, as well as vascular cox-2,
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

2332

may be a part of a homeostatic defence mechanism
limiting the consequences of platelet activation in
vivo.[181]
in support of this, in vivo biochemical studies
suggest that selective cox-2 inhibition could alter
the platelet-blood vessel wall homeostasis mediated
by a balance between txa2 and prostacyclin effects, where txa2 acts as a vasoconstrictor and
promotes platelet aggregation, while prostacyclin
acts as a vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. administration of cox-2-selective inhibitors
such as celecoxib or rofecoxib to healthy volunteers
resulted in a suppression of in vivo prostacyclin
production as measured by its urinary metabolite,
while there was no effect on platelet txa2 production.[182,183] this is in contrast to the effects of lowdose aspirin, which induces suppression platelet
txa2 production while it has relatively minor effects on vascular prostacyclin production.[150,186]
4.3.2  xxxd2688xxx 

 xxxd2688xxx  has been compared with  xxxd2352xxx  with regards to the cardiovascular and
renal responses to exercise in healthy volunteers.[187]
neither compound, given as a daily dose of  xxxd2688xxx  1g or  xxxd2352xxx  100mg during rest or exercise, had any effect on arterial blood pressure (bp),
cardiac output, renal responses or plasma catecholamines.
cox inhibitors have frequently been reported to
interfere with the bp-lowering effects of a number
of antihypertensive drugs.[188] in a study by thakur
et al.,[189]  xxxd2688xxx  did not influence the antihypertensive response of a fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide combination in hypertensive women
with arthritis.
in another larger study involving 1042 patients
with oa of the knee, rofecoxib 12.5mg or  xxxd2688xxx  1g was given over a 6-week treatment
period.[79,162] the primary objective was to compare
the therapeutic efficacy of the two treatment alternatives. in this trial, there were similar proportions of
patients in the  xxxd2688xxx  and rofecoxib groups
that experienced hypertension or increased bp.
however, there were more patients who reported
oedema-related adverse events in the rofecoxib
group, which led the evaluator to conclude that: “an
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

hedner et al.

increase in cardiovascular events at higher doses of
rofecoxib cannot be excluded”.[79,162]
in another similar trial (n = 978),[79,162]  xxxd2688xxx  1g was compared with rofecoxib 12.5mg or
placebo, also in patients with oa of the knee, for 6
weeks. in this study there were significantly more
patients discontinuing rofecoxib treatment because
of clinical adverse experiences (7.4%) compared
with  xxxd2688xxx  (3.8%) or placebo (3.6%). there
were no deaths in the study, but significantly more
serious adverse experiences were reported on
rofecoxib therapy (2.3%) compared with  xxxd2688xxx  (0.5%) or placebo (0.5%).[79,162] furthermore,
in this study there were significantly more reports
with one or more adverse experiences in rofecoxib
patients (56.4%) compared with  xxxd2688xxx 
(49.2%) or placebo (42.9%). in addition, there were
six serious cardiovascular adverse experiences (mi,
cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation) in the
rofecoxib-treated patients compared with two such
experiences (congestive heart failure, mi) in patients treated with  xxxd2688xxx  and one (coronary
artery occlusion) in the placebo group.
a recent study by palmer and coworkers[190]
showed that  xxxd2688xxx  therapy was well tolerated
in patients with antihypertensive therapy and on a
par with cox-2 therapy.[190] they performed a
double-blind study in which 385 hypertensive patients were stabilised on an ace inhibitor and concomitantly treated with  xxxd2688xxx , celecoxib, ibuprofen or placebo for 4 weeks. this was an experimental study in patients without ra or oa.
ibuprofen caused significantly greater increases in
systolic (p < 0.001) and diastolic (p < 0.01) bp
compared with placebo, but not  xxxd2688xxx  or celecoxib. the proportion of patients with systolic bp
increases of clinical concern at endpoint was significantly higher (p < 0.001) for the ibuprofen group
(16.7%; 15 of 90), but not for the  xxxd2688xxx  group
(5.5%; 5 of 91) or the celecoxib group (4.6%; 4 of
87) compared with the placebo group (1.1%; 1 of
91).
4.3.3 cox-2 inhibitors

specifically, since the cox-2-selective agents
rofecoxib and celecoxib lack antiplatelet properties,
one could anticipate that there would be an increased risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

patients compared with cox-1/cox-2 inhibitory
agents. in the vigor study, which included 8076
patients, rofecoxib was compared with naproxen.[160] in this study there were an increased number of mis in the patient group receiving rofecoxib.
in the rofecoxib group 0.4% (n = 111) of patients
had a mi compared with 0.1% (n = 50) in the patient
group receiving the nonselective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor naproxen over the follow-up period.[160] the
increased incidence of mis in the patient group
randomised to rofecoxib has been ascribed to the
lack of platelet effects[159] of the cox-2 selective
agent rofecoxib.
although there was a 4-fold increase in mi in
patients on the cox-2 inhibitor in the vigor
study,[160] in the class study which compared
celecoxib with ibuprofen or diclofenac, the rate of
mi did not differ between groups.[161] one difference between the two studies was that low-dose
aspirin was allowed when indicated in the class
study, where approximately 20% of patients took
low-dose aspirin. this was not permitted in the
vigor study, although a further and later analysis
of the vigor study cohort showed that 4% of
patients met clinical criteria for low-dose aspirin
treatment but were not taking it. interestingly, 38%
of patients who had a mi event were in this subgroup. these results have been interpreted as showing that selective cox-2 inhibition may provoke mi
clinical events in patients at risk and that low-dose
aspirin or nonspecific cox inhibition may be protective in these patients.[73,157,176,177]
in the vigor study, the increased cardiovascular risk seen with rofecoxib relative to naproxen may be explained by the actions of cox-2
inhibition or the lack of platelet cox-1 inhibition.
this effect is likely to have been absent or reduced
in the class study, where low-dose aspirin was
allowed in those patients who had indications for
such therapy. therefore, one may argue that an
increased cardiovascular risk, if confirmed, may be
a class effect of cox-2 inhibitors and not specific
for rofecoxib only. on the basis of these findings
and arguments, there has been speculation as to
whether an increase in cardiovascular risk of cox-2
inhibition would balance estimates of lives lost as a
result of cox-1-/cox-2-related major upper gi
events.[161]
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

2333

in australia, calculated cox-1-/cox-2-induced
upper gi haemorrhage- and bleeding-related deaths
has amounted to 100–200 patients each year.[191] if
there was an increase in ischaemic heart disease
deaths of 100–200 per annum this would amount to
an increase of only 0.34–0.68% of deaths per
year.[192] thus, only a very small proportionate increase in ischaemic heart disease death related to
cox-2-selective inhibitors would outweigh any advantage of reduced upper gi mortality compared
with conventional platelet inhibitory cox-1/cox-2
inhibitors.
in addition to this, british as well as australian
committees on safety of medicines have reported
that the spectrum of adverse effects for the selective
cox-2 inhibitors includes morbidity as well as mortality related to pubs.[192,193] moreover, there were
also significant numbers of cardiovascular and renal
adverse events among the spectrum of adverse effects reported.
additional evidence from case reports may also
indicate that use of cox-2 inhibitors could exacerbate thrombotic disease. two patients with connective tissue diseases and medical histories suggestive
of antiphospholipid syndrome both developed arterial occlusions after celecoxib.[194] thus, on a population level, deaths from upper gi toxicity related to
nonselective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors or preferential cox-2 inhibitors may well be balanced by their
cardiovascular protective effects in patients at high
risk.[178] thus, the previous focus on safety of cox2-specific inhibitors in relation to upper gi events
may have overlooked the obvious and clinically
important fact that cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors have
beneficial cardiovascular actions, which do provide
sizeable reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.
4.4 renal adverse effects of cox inhibition

in the kidneys, prostaglandins maintain a normal
renal blood flow (rbf) and normal gfr by balancing a number of vasoconstrictor stimuli.[195-199] renal cox-1 is constitutionally expressed in endothelial cells, in smooth muscle cells, in glomeruli and in
the cells of the tubular collecting duct system.[200-202]
the location of cox-1 in the kidneys indicate that
prostaglandins are of local haemodynamic importance as well as having a direct effect on the saltdrugs 2004; 64 (20)

2334

water excretion.[201,202] renal cox-1 is responsible
for prostaglandin synthesis under normal conditions
but, in contrast to several other tissues, there is also a
relatively pronounced constitutive expression of
cox-2 under normal physiological conditions.[199,201,203,204] in experimental animals, this expression takes place in the renal medulla and macula
densa.[202,205,206] in addition, cox-2 activity is increased during conditions of salt and water restriction,[201,202] which indicates that prostaglandin synthesis via cox-2 plays a role in the regulation of the
salt-water balance and renal haemodynamics during
normal physiological as well as pathophysiological
conditions.
4.4.1 cox-1/cox-2 inhibition

cox-mediated inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via cox-1 results in a reduction of rbf and
gfr, as well as salt and water retention since there
is an inhibition of the vasodilatory effect of the
prostaglandins on the renal vascular bed.[207,208] the
effects of cox-1 inhibition are largely dose related
and a 20–50% reduction of rbf and gfr can be
seen within 24–48 hours after drug administration.[207] in some patients or individuals at high risk,
acute renal failure may develop.[209] patients at particular risk for adverse effects affecting renal function are those who have an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as during salt and water restriction
or individuals who already have a reduced rbf and
gfr through other mechanisms or diseases.[207-209]
in such individuals, maintenance of an intact renal
haemodynamic function is critically dependent on
intact prostaglandin synthesis and homeostasis.
however, the risk of renal adverse events by coxmediated prostaglandin inhibition is minimal in individuals with a normal renal function.[208] when
symptoms do appear in individual patients, they
vary from moderate weight increase, peripheral oedema, increased bp or precipitation of hyperkalaemia to overt congestive heart failure or even
acute renal failure.[207-209] the negative effects on
rbf and gfr become apparent within a few days
after initiation of treatment with cox inhibitors,
while symptoms related to an increased salt and
water retention usually appear after a longer time on
therapy.[207-209] in order to detect untoward renal
effects by cox inhibitors, it is important to closely
monitor patients who are at an increased risk for

developing renal adverse effects. this can be done
by simple tests reflecting renal function, such as
control of serum creatinine 1 week after start of
treatment with a cox inhibitor.
apart from functionally related adverse effects
on the renal function, cox-1 inhibitors may also
exert direct nephrotoxic effects, which may lead to
interstitial renal damage and pronounced proteinuria.[207,208,210] however, this type of adverse effect
is relatively uncommon. the time span to its development may vary from days to months after exposure to cox inhibitor treatment and the renal damage does not appear to be directly related to the
inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. in most patients the renal damage is fully or partially reversible
after cessation of the cox-1 inhibitor therapy.[207]
4.4.2  xxxd2688xxx 

after hepatic conversion from  xxxd2688xxx ,
6-mna inhibits cox-2 as well as cox-1 in a
cox-2 preferential manner. several well controlled
studies have investigated the renal effects of  xxxd2688xxx  in humans.[77,211-213] in these studies,  xxxd2688xxx  was compared with placebo,  xxxd2352xxx ,
 xxxd3259xxx  and ibuprofen, but none of the studies
investigated the renal effects of  xxxd2688xxx  compared with a cox-2-selective inhibitor such as
rofecoxib or celecoxib. however, most studies have
investigated relatively small patient groups during
short durations of therapy, commonly between 1 and
4 weeks. moreover, the studies have generally not
included patients with known renal disease, congestive heart failure or patients with a negative saltwater balance, but rather included patient groups at
low risk for renal adverse events. results from such
studies show that patients with a low risk for renal
adverse effects from cox inhibition have had no
apparent untoward effects of  xxxd2688xxx  on renal
function. furthermore, there are no reports of interstitial renal damage during therapy with  xxxd2688xxx  as yet.
thus, the renal effect profile of  xxxd2688xxx  appears to be qualitatively similar to the type of renal
adverse event profile seen with nonselective
cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors. available documentation
for  xxxd2688xxx  further indicates that there is a low
incidence of such renal adverse events in individuals
with a normal renal function without any other
drugs 2004; 64 (20)

known risk factors for renal damage by cox inhibition.[77,211-213]
4.4.3 cox-2 inhibitors

while the renal consequences of nonselective
cox inhibition are well characterised, the effects of
selective cox-2 inhibition on renal function and
structure are to date less well known. brater and
coworkers[204] reviewed the renal effects of selective
cox-2 inhibitors and concluded that cox-2-selective inhibitors and nonselective cox inhibitors induce similar reductions in urinary prostaglandin excretion and gfr as well as similar degrees of saltwater retention. thus, it is unlikely that selective
cox-2 inhibition would result in a different spectrum of renal adverse events compared with nonselective cox inhibitors. indeed, current research
and clinical experience show that selective cox-2
inhibitors as well as nonselective cox-1/cox-2
inhibitors share a similar renal adverse event profile.[201,202,214] thus, cox-2-selective inhibitors
should be used with similar restrictions as nonselective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors in patient groups at
increased risk for renal adverse events, that is, patients with reduced renal function, diabetes mellitus
or congestive heart failure. current postmarketing
experience and adverse event or side effect reporting
also indicate that cox-2-selective inhibitors may
induce interstitial renal damage as expected as a
result of the presence of cox-2 in the renal medulla.[201,215,216]
as mentioned in section 4.4.1, selective cox-2
inhibitors seem to share a similar renal adverse
event profile to the nonselective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors or a preferential cox-2 inhibitor. thus,
from a renal point of view it is questionable whether
or not cox-2 inhibitors provide any advantage over
conventional cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors.
5. hepatic adverse effects of
cox inhibition
elevations in serum transaminase levels may occur with  xxxd2688xxx  therapy, which is similar to
other cox-inhibitors. thus, there are some reports
of elevations in  xxxg941xxx  (alt) and
aspartate transaminase (ast) in patients receiving
© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

 xxxd2688xxx , but the incidence of marked elevations
of serum transaminase levels in major clinical trials
was <1%.[31,80] in patients with symptoms and/or
signs suggestive of liver dysfunction, or in whom an
abnormal liver function test has occurred while receiving cox inhibitor treatment, an evaluation for
evidence of a more severe hepatic reaction should be
performed.
in long-term safety studies of  xxxd2688xxx ,
marked elevations in alt and ast were observed
in only 0.4% of treated patients.[80] similar results
were also reported by jackson et al.[31] in a study
cohort of more than 1900 patients from which ten
patients withdrew because of liver function test abnormalities. no clinically important changes or
trends were apparent in the remaining patients as
assessed by the predefined abnormal test definition
(ast and alt >100% of normal range). however,
in this patient cohort there was a trend toward an
elevation of lactate dehydrogenase.[31] in another
large patient study comparing the safety experience
of  xxxd2688xxx  and four other cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors, patients were randomised to one of the following groups:  xxxd2688xxx  1–2 g/day (n = 3315);
diclofenac 100–200 mg/day (n = 296); naproxen
500–1000 g/day for oa patients or 1500 g/day for
ra patients (n = 279); ibuprofen 1.2–3.2 g/day
(n = 235); or  xxxd2969xxx  10–20 mg/day (n = 286). of
the five cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors studied, diclofenac was the only agent associated with significant
elevations of transaminases (at least two to three
times the upper limit of normal).[217] with diclofenac
therapy, the incidence of ast elevation was 1.1%
compared with 0.2% with  xxxd2688xxx  (p < 0.01).
for the other three cox inhibitors the incidence of
alt elevation was 0% for  xxxd2969xxx  and 0.4% for
naproxen and ibuprofen, respectively. in another
study investigating patients aged 65 years or more,
the incidence of abnormal hepatic function related
or probably related to  xxxd2688xxx  therapy was
0.4% (n = 1392) compared with 3.3% (n = 174) of
patients treated with diclofenac (p < 0.04).[218]
thus, from a hepatic point of view,  xxxd2688xxx 
appears to be a safe alternative in a wide range of
patients.

6. comparison of adverse events
spectrum between cox-1/cox-2 and
cox-2 selective inhibitors
the optimal ratio of cox-2 to cox-1 inhibition
for obtaining an anti-inflammatory response and an
acceptable safety profile of an anti-inflammatory
agent is not yet settled. while cox-1 previously
was thought to be important in maintaining cellular
homeostasis (e.g. in the gi tract, kidney and platelets), cox-2 was considered to be induced during
inflammatory states.[219] however, more recent evidence in cox-1 knockout mice suggests that
cox-1 may also play a role in the inflammatory
process. langenbach et al.[86] showed a reduced
inflammatory response to  xxxd208xxx  in such
animals, while cox-2 knockout mice were still able
to show inflammatory responses.[220] there is also
evidence suggesting that cox-2 may play an important role in gi epithelial integrity and gi ulcer
healing,[89,90,221] bone and cartilage repair,[222] renal
haemodynamics and function[223,224] and ovarian
function.[225] these studies, except the one by
stichtenoth et al.[223] which was performed in
healthy volunteers and demonstrated that cox-2 is
responsible for the prostaglandin synthesis-mediated renin release, were all performed in animal
models. in 40 healthy salt-depleted volunteers, rossat et al.[226] showed that a selective cox-2 inhibitor
at higher doses reduced gfr and renal plasma flow
compared with baseline. it is possible that cox-1
and cox-2 have overlapping functions in inflammatory states and during normal physiological
conditions.[227,228] in order to determine the physiological roles of cox-1 and cox-2 and the possible
clinical relevance of such findings, well controlled
clinical trials are needed to properly assess the relative inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 with respect to
safety as well as efficacy.
the efficacy, safety and tolerability of  xxxd2688xxx  were compared with rofecoxib and placebo in
341 oa patients aged ≥80 years.[229] in this trial, the
primary efficacy endpoint, patient global assessment of disease status, was similarly reduced for
the two active treatments versus placebo. secondary
endpoints, including the three western ontario and
mcmaster universities oa index (womac) subscales (pain, stiffness and disability) and the investi© 2004 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

gator global assessment of disease status, were
consistent with the primary endpoint. there were no
significant between-group differences in the proportions of patients who discontinued treatment as a
result of clinical adverse events or abnormal laboratory values. renal adverse experiences such as oedema and hypertension were similar for rofecoxib
and  xxxd2688xxx . there were no gastroduodenal ulcers reported in the trial. from these data, the authors concluded that in oa patients ≥80 years, clinical efficacy for rofecoxib 12.5 and 25mg once daily
was similar to that of  xxxd2688xxx  1.5g. moreover,
and importantly, both the selective cox inhibitor
rofecoxib and the cox-1/cox-2 prodrug  xxxd2688xxx  were well tolerated in this elderly study cohort.
7. conclusion
since the start of clinical use of aspirin more than
a century ago,[230] there has been a quest for agents
with anti-inflammatory properties equal or better
than aspirin but with decreased toxicity. as a result
of this, a wide range of cox inhibitors have been
developed and become clinically available over the
past five decades. although the anti-inflammatory
efficacy of these agents has remained largely similar, there has been a focus on finding cox inhibitors
with a more beneficial adverse effect profile, in
particular related to gi ulcers or bleeding complications as well as cardiovascular, haematological and
renal adverse events. importantly, in spite of the fact
that many promising agents from the cox inhibitor
class have been developed over the years, the true
and complete adverse event profile for any individual agent only becomes apparent after many years of
clinical use in large patient populations the clinic.
the choice of a specific cox inhibitor for patients
with oa, ra or other inflammatory disorders
should ideally be based on such critical evaluations
of therapeutic benefit versus individual risks.
 xxxd2688xxx  is a chemically distinct cox inhibitor prodrug that is converted to its active metabolite,
6-nma, which acts prostaglandin synthase inhibitor
by a dual blockade of cox-1/cox-2. in clinical use
 xxxd2688xxx  exhibits an anti-inflammatory efficacy
that is similar to a wide range of other cox-1/
cox-2 as well as selective cox-2 inhibitors. in
terms of safety,  xxxd2688xxx  has been extensively
evaluated in large postmarketing surveillance studdrugs 2004; 64 (20)

 xxxd2688xxx  in arthritis

ies showing that it is well accepted by patients with a
very low incidence of liver or kidney damage and
bone marrow suppression as well as precipitation of
heart failure or oedema. interestingly, there is also a
low incidence of cardiovascular complications,
which may be due to the fact that the 6-mna
metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx  provides a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation.
a major clinical drawback associated with the
long-term use of a cox inhibitor is that of gi
pubs.[82] for most cox inhibitors, the incidence of
pubs ranges between 2% and 4% per year, and
increases significantly in the presence of certain risk
factors.[83] for  xxxd2688xxx , the cumulative incidence of pubs in large clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance studies is considerably less, and
ranges between 0.02% and 0.95%. the reason behind this lower incidence of pubs is considered to
be due to the nonacidic nature of the parent  xxxd2688xxx  compound as well as the lack of enterohepatic
circulation.[28] these properties of  xxxd2688xxx  are
thought to be the main reasons for the improved gi
safety profile of this agent. in recent studies on a
comparatively small number (341) of elderly oa
patients,  xxxd2688xxx  1.5g has been compared with
rofecoxib 12.5 and 25mg in terms of efficacy and
safety,[229] in particular, gi or cardiovascular/renal
adverse experiences. these studies did not demonstrate any differences in the gi/cardiovascular/renal
safety profile between the agents, nor were there any
differences in the clinical efficacy in elderly oa
patients. these data provide evidence that  xxxd2688xxx  may offer a similar degree of gi safety as the
cox-2-selective agent rofecoxib. in addition to
that,  xxxd2688xxx  may, in contrast to a cox-2 inhibitor, offer platelet inhibitory properties by an action
on cox-1.
in conclusion,  xxxd2688xxx  is a cox-1/cox-2
inhibitor prodrug that has been clinically available
for the management of ra, oa and other rheumatic
disorders for approximately two decades. current
evidence shows that long-term  xxxd2688xxx  treatment of such disorders may also offer patients a gi
safety profile that is superior to nonselective
cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors and seems to be similar to
that of a cox-2 selective inhibitor, albeit with preserved cardiovascular preventive properties.
