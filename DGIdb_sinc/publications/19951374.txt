abstract
background: the prevalence of airway inﬂammatory disorders keeps rising; its pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood.
objective: the present study aimed to investigate the role of muscarinic receptor (m
receptor) in regulating the immune cell activity in nasal mucosa by using surgical
removed nasal mucosa from patients with nasal polyposis (np) as a study platform.
methods: human nasal mucosal sample was collected from inferior turbinectomy of
86 patients with np or/and allergic rhinitis. expression of  xxxg2296xxx 
alpha (tnf-alpha), m receptor, ox40 ligand was measured in nasal mucosa by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ﬂow cytometry, and western blotting assay.
results: when compared with non-np (nnp) nasal mucosa, contents of tnf-alpha
and tnf-alpha(+) cells markedly increased in np nasal mucosa; immune staining
colocalized  xxxg449xxx (+) and tnf-alpha(+) cells in np nasal mucosa; exposure
of isolated cd4(+) t cells to  xxxd2586xxx  induced the release of tnf-alpha. we
also found  xxxg1208xxx (+)/ xxxg449xxx (+) cells in np nasal mucosa.  xxxd2586xxx 
increased the expression of ox40l in dendritic cells. staphylococcal (s) aureus and
s. enterotoxin b (seb) were detected in np nasal mucosa. exposure of dendritic
cells or naı̈ve cd4(+) t cells to seb initiated the expression of  xxxg449xxx  at
mrna and protein levels.
conclusions: the present data demonstrate that parasympathetic activity has the
capacity to activate dendritic cells to release ox40 ligand, the latter induces
cd4(+) t cells to produce il-4 and tnf-alpha that may further contribute to the
pathogenesis of np.

nasal polyposis (np) features as a chronic immune inﬂammation in nasal mucosa that is usually arise from inﬂammatory nasal mucosa complicating with chronic rhinosinusitis;
the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis is >10% of the general population in the world (1). the pathogenesis is not fully
elucidated. the treatment of np is not satisfactory currently.
recurrence of np after surgical remove or other treatments
is very often (2, 3) because the causative factors of np are
not clear.
not only causing the nasal stufﬁness, np is also associated
with inﬂammatory disorders in the lower airways, such as
hypersensitivity reaction to normal antigens. over 84% of
sinonasal ct scans shows abnormal results in severe asthmatic patients (4). asthmatic patients usually beneﬁt from
removing the pathogenic tissue from nasal cavity and sinuses

(5). because t helper 2 (th2) cytokines and tumor necrosis
factor a ( xxxg2296xxx ) were found in np nasal mucosa (6), these
mediators may be released and absorbed into the blood
stream to affect the immune homeostasis in other organs,
such as in the lower airways, of the body, but the direct evidence is still scarcely available.
 xxxg2296xxx  is a proinﬂammatory cytokine that is involved in
an array of inﬂammatory process such as asthma (7), np (6,
8), inﬂammatory bowel disease (9), and rheumatic arthritis
(10). yet apart from the ﬁnding that levels of  xxxg2296xxx  were
increased in np nasal mucosa, from which cell type the
 xxxg2296xxx  derived from is not clear.
nasal mucosal dcs from chronic nonallergic rhinitis
(nar) patients or healthy subjects are positive for  xxxg376xxx ,

 xxxg398xxx , and ccr6 (11). high levels of  xxxg398xxx  were detected in
dendritic cells (dc) of ar nasal mucosa (12). among the cell
markers,  xxxg1208xxx  is generally selected as dc markers (13)
although it is overlapped with macrophages. it is proposed
that ox40/ox40 ligand (ox40l) interaction in dcs induces
cd4+ t cells to produce  xxxg2296xxx  and il-4 (14) that plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of immune inﬂammation
such as airway allergy (15). activated dcs produce ox40l
upon proper stimulation such as exposure to thymic stromal
lymphopoietin (16). however, little information is published
yet on whether nasal mucosal dcs produce ox40l.
it is accepted that cholinergic activity plays a role in nasal
mucosal inﬂammation. five types of muscarinic receptors (m
receptor) were identiﬁed in the blood vessels and glands in
nasal mucosa (16, 17); whether immune cells in nasal mucosa
express m receptors is not clear. on the other hand, microbial
products have a close relation with the regulation of immune
responses (18, 19); but whether microbial products modulate
the parasympathetic activity, and immune reaction in the
nasal mucosa is not fully understood. therefore, based on the
previous information, we hypothesized that microbial product
can be one of the important factors that modulate the immune
responses in the nasal mucosa to play an important role in the
pathogenesis of np. the present study used surgical removed
nasal mucosa as a study platform and aimed to analyze (i)
 xxxg2296xxx  contents and  xxxg2296xxx + cells in np nasal mucosa; (ii)
m receptor expression/activation inﬂuencing the function of
nasal mucosal immune cells; and (iii) microbial products modulating the expression of m receptor in immune cells of nasal
mucosa. the results showed that microbial products up regulate the expression of  xxxg449xxx  in nasal mucosal immune
cells that further increases the production of ox40l in nasal
dcs and drives the production of  xxxg2296xxx  in nasal mucosa.

contained <0.2 u lps/10 lg reagents.
patients
eighty-six patients were recruited into this study that
included 30 np/ar, 30 np/nar (not ar), 18 not np
(nnp)/ar, and 8 nnp/nar (table 1). the demographic data
were listed in table 2. the diagnosis of ar was followed the
established criteria at our department that was also published
elsewhere (20). all patients had severe symptoms of nasal
obstruction because of the hypertrophic inferior turbinate.
all ar patients had positive allergy responses for mite nasal
allergy, determined by a clinical history, a nasal smear positive for eosinophils, positive intradermal testing, serum mitespeciﬁc ige antibodies (all the patients had >2.0 kua/l
serum mite (der p 1)-speciﬁc ige that ranged as 0.21–
18.8 kua/l), positive nasal provocation test responses to mite
allergen and negative test responses for other common aeroallergens. np diagnosis was based on nasal cavity examination
and pathoanatomic examination on np-like tissue biopsies.
five patients with nasal cancer were also recruited. the marginal nasal mucosa was excised from surgically removed tissue using as control. all the patients were repeatedly treated
with medical intervention (including nasal spray of decongestion and steroids) that did not get satisfactory results and
asked for surgical treatment with inferior turbinectomy,
remove np and some with endoscopic sinus surgery. written

informed consent was obtained from each patient. the study
protocol was approved by the human research ethic committee at shanxi medical university. all subjects did not use
any medicines in past 2 weeks. the patients recruited in the
present study did not have nasal surgery history.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)
serum mite (der p 1)-speciﬁc ige, contents of  xxxg2296xxx  and
ox40l were determined by elisa with commercial reagent
kits following the manufacturer’s instruction.
flow cytometry
cells were collected and incubated with ﬂuorescently labeled
primary antibodies (or isotype igg) on ice for 30 min (for
the intracellular staining, cells were ﬁxed with 1% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min and incubated with permeabilization reagents for 30 min on ice). the stained cells were
analyzed using a facsarray (bd bioscience, san jose, ca,
usa). data were analyzed with software flow jo.
immunohistochemistry
nasal mucosal cryosections were ﬁxed with acetone
for 20 min. after blocking with 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
for 30 min, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (anti- xxxg449xxx , 1 : 1000; anti-tnf-alpha, 1 : 200)
or isotype igg at 4c overnight. sections were incubated
with ﬂuorescence-labeled second antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature.  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (10 lg/ml, 15 min) was used
as contrast staining. washing with pbs was performed after
each incubation. sections were observed with a confocal
microscope (lsm510).
quantitative real time rt-pcr (qpcr)
total rna was extracted from collected cells using an rneasy
mini kit. cdna was synthesized using iscripttmcdna synthesis kit. the resulting cdna was subjected to qpcr that
was performed with a lightcycler using a superscript iii
platinum sybr green two-step qpcr kit. the ampliﬁed
product was detected by the presence of an sybr green ﬂuorescent signal. b-actin cdna was used as the internal control.
the primers of human ox40l were forward: 5¢-gtgaatggcggagaactgat-3¢; reverse: 5¢-gccaggatctgcttcttgtc-3¢ (ncbi:
x79929).

m receptor, tnf-alpha and nasal polyposis

was detected with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents and
recorded with x-ray ﬁlms.
immune cell isolation
surgical removed nasal tissue (12.5 g tissue/patient was
obtained in the present study) obtained from all patients that
were cut into small pieces and treated with predigestion solution (1 · hbss containing 5 mm edta and 1 mm dtt) at
37c for 30 min under slow rotation. the tissue was collected
by centrifugation (126 · g, 10 min) and incubated in digestion solution (dissolve 0.05 g of collagenase d, 0.05 g of
dnase i and 0.3 g of dispase ii in 100 ml of 1 times pbs) at
37c for 60 min under slow rotation. cells were ﬁltered with
a cell strainer. isolation of  xxxg1208xxx + dcs and cd4+ t cells
was performed with commercial magnetic cell sorting kits.
the purity of all the isolated cells was over 90% as checked
by ﬂow cytometry. one gram nasal tissue could harvest
0.31.2 · 105 dcs and 0.53.8 · 106 cd4+ t cells in the
present study.
generation of dcs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmc)
immature dcs were generated from pbmc with our established protocol (21) that was also described elsewhere (22).
brieﬂy, pbmcs were prepared from healthy volunteers by
gravity density centrifugation. the isolated pbmcs were then
transferred into 12-well plates at a density of 0.5 · 106 cells/
ml and placed in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37c. the cells
were grown in rpmi1640 media supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 u/ml) and streptomycin
(100 lg/ml), il-4 (10 ng/ml) and gm-csf (20 ng/ml). the
cytokine-supplemented medium was replaced weekly, and the
nonadherent cells were collected and split to fresh medium.
 xxxg1208xxx ,  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  expression were used as an indicator of dcs. as shown by ﬂow cytometry, over 95% cells
were  xxxg1208xxx  positive in day 6 with mild expression of  xxxg396xxx 
and  xxxg398xxx  (compared with lps-stimulated dcs; data not
shown); these cells were used for further experiments.
statistics
the data were expressed as means ± sd of at least three
independent experiments. the values were analyzed using the
two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test when data consisted of
two groups or by anova when three or more groups were
compared. p < 0.05 was set as the statistically signiﬁcant.

western blotting
total proteins were extracted from surgical removed nasal
mucosa or cultured cells with established procedures (18).
equal amounts protein extracts of each sample were separated on a precast nupage gel system and blotted onto
nitrocellulose membrane. the membranes were then blotted
with primary antibodies against target proteins. the proteins
were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies. horseradish peroxidase enzymatic reaction

results
 xxxg2296xxx  level is increased in nasal mucosa of patients with np
published data indicate that the proinﬂammatory cytokine
 xxxg2296xxx  is associated with an array of immune diseases such
as allergic rhinitis (ar) (23), low airway hypersensitivity (24),
rheumatoid arthritis (25), and intestinal inﬂammation (26).
because np is also an immune disorder (27), we speculated

might be increased in np nasal mucosa. to prove the speculation, we isolated cd4+ t cells from surgically removed
nasal mucosa with or without np and stained with antitnf-a antibody. as shown by ﬂow cytometry data, signiﬁcantly more  xxxg2296xxx + cells were detected in those from np
nasal mucosa than cells from nnp nasal mucosa (fig. 2).

that the  xxxg2296xxx  might play a role in the pathogenesis of np.
to test the hypothesis, we evaluated the levels of  xxxg2296xxx  in
surgically removed nasal mucosal extracts from patients with
nasal mucosal hyperplasia with or without np. as shown by
elisa data, levels of  xxxg2296xxx  were signiﬁcantly higher in
patients with np than that from nnp. further analyses
showed that the levels of  xxxg2296xxx  in nasal mucosal specimen
from patients with both np and ar were not signiﬁcantly
higher than those with np/nar (fig. 1).
 xxxg2296xxx + cells increase in np nasal mucosa
a subtype of immune cells produces  xxxg2296xxx  in inﬂammatory
tissue. we had detected the increase in  xxxg2296xxx  in nasal
mucosa (fig. 1). thus, it was conceivable that  xxxg2296xxx + cells

it is not clear what factors cause  xxxg2296xxx + cell increase in np
nasal mucosa. published data indicate that human nasal
mucosa expresses m receptor 1–5 (24). m3 is the subtype
that most abundantly expresses in nasal mucosa (24). using
m receptor blockers suppresses the clinical symptoms of
nasal immune disorders (28). the present data show that
 xxxg2296xxx + cells are increased in np nasal mucosa (fig. 2) that
implies m3 may be increased in np nasal mucosa. to this
end, we employed the double immune staining technique with
antibodies against  xxxg2296xxx  and m receptor 3 to stain cryosections of nasal mucosa. the results showed that number of
 xxxg2296xxx + m3+ cells was signiﬁcantly more in np nasal
mucosa than those of nnp (fig. 3). it is noteworthy that
apart from co-stained with  xxxg2296xxx , many other cells were
also stained positively with anti-m3 antibody. to identify the
cell types of the  xxxg2296xxx ) m3+ cells in nasal mucosa, m3+
cells were isolated from surgically removed nasal mucosa
by magnetic cell sorting (macs) and stained with antibodies
against  xxxg1208xxx , il-4, inf-c, foxp3,  xxxg1166xxx  and m3, and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. the results showed that apart from
 xxxg2296xxx + m3+ cells,  xxxg1208xxx + m3+ cells and il-4+ m3+
cells were also identiﬁed. the results indicate that dcs in

interaction of  xxxd2586xxx  (mch)/m3 triggers  xxxg2296xxx  release
from cd4+ t cells in np nasal mucosa
because we found that nasal mucosal immune cells coexpressed m3 and  xxxg2296xxx , we wondered whether activation
of m3 could be a factor to trigger the release of  xxxg2296xxx . to
this end, cd4+ t cells were isolated from surgically removed
np nasal mucosa. as prechecked by ﬂow cytometry with
sample cells, these cd4+ t cells expressed high levels of
 xxxg2296xxx  (data not shown). the cells were exposed to mch at
graded concentrations for 30 min. as expected,  xxxg2296xxx 
was detected in culture media that was in a mch dose-dependent manner (fig. 4).

of seb could initiate the expression of m3 in nasal mucosal
dcs. to prove this point, our ﬁrst attempt was to check
whether these patients with np also had staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) colonization in nasal mucosa. with published
approaches (29), we isolated s. aureus from surgical removed
nasal mucosa of 13/30 np patients. statistical assay resulted
in positive correlation to m3 expression (r = 0.65, p < 0.05)
in isolated dcs (fig. 6g). in nnp patients, s. aureus was
detected in 3/30; the correlation assay resulted r = 0.105,
p > 0.05. in an alternative approach, we assessed the levels
of seb in protein extracts from surgically removed nasal
mucosa. as shown by elisa, 27/30 np patients had
high levels of seb in their nasal mucosa (mean =
45.8 ± 12.6 ng/mg protein); positive correlationship (r =
0.93, p < 0.001) was also determined between seb levels
and m3 expression in isolated dcs. on the other hand, seb
was only detected in 5/30 patients with nnp (2.6 ± 2.1 ng/
mg protein) (r = 0.26 between seb and m3 expression,
p > 0.05).
the results in the observation of s. aureus and seb in
nasal mucosa imply a positive connection between seb and
m3 expression existing in dcs in np nasal mucosa. to conﬁrm the speculation, we generated dcs from peripheral
mononuclear cells with our established protocol (21). the
dcs were exposed to seb in culture at graded concentrations for 48 h. as shown by ﬂow cytometry assay, the expression of m3 in dcs was increased in seb dose-dependent
manner. the results were further conﬁrmed by qpcr and
western blotting assay (fig. 6).

 xxxg2296xxx -producing cells. to test the hypothesis, dcs were isolated from surgically removed nasal mucosa by macs. the
expression of m3 on isolated dcs was checked with ﬂow
cytometry; about 30% dcs expressed m3 (fig. 3f). the isolated dcs were exposed to mch in culture at graded concentrations for 48 h. as shown by elisa data, the expression
of ox40l was markedly increased in culture media of dcs
from np patients that was higher than that from nnp
patients. the results were further conﬁrmed by western blotting assay (fig. 5). to clarify whether dcs constitutively
express m3, we isolated dcs from the peripheral blood. as
detected by ﬂow cytometry, the expression of m3 was very
low in peripheral dcs (data not shown). the results demonstrate that m3 is not constitutively expressed in dcs; but can

in dcs
because dcs from np nasal mucosa expressed m3, while
peripheral dcs did not, other factors within nasal mucosa
must be triggers for the expression of m3 in nasal mucosal
dcs. we previously found that seb drove dcs to express
t-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 4 (tim4) in dcs that
plays a critical role in the initiation of skewed th2 polarization (18, 19); we therefore wondered whether the stimulation

with the advantage of obtaining relatively large volume of
human tissue from inferior nasal turbinectomy of patients
with chronic hyperplasia rhinitis and np, we isolated sufﬁcient immune cells that gave us opportunity to study the roles
of these cells in the pathogenesis of immune inﬂammation in
nasal mucosa. the study had several novel ﬁndings that
include (i) nasal mucosal dcs express muscarinic receptor 3
(m3); (ii) activation of m3 by mch induced the expression of
ox40l in dcs; (iii) il-4+  xxxg2296xxx + t cells were abundant
in nasal mucosa of patients with np; (iv) m3 expression was
also identiﬁed in il-4+  xxxg2296xxx + t cells of np nasal mucosa;
(v) exposure to mch drove np nasal mucosa-derived  xxxd3054xxx +  xxxg2296xxx + t cells to release il-4 and  xxxg2296xxx .
it is proposed that np is resulted from chronic inﬂammation. allergy is one of the major factors in the induction of
np in which ige and mast cell degranulation are regarded as
the major effector factors (30).  xxxg2296xxx  is one of the chemical
mediators of mast cell that is released upon mast cell activation. previous studies also found that increases in  xxxg2296xxx  in
np nasal mucosa (31). our data are in line with these studies
by revealing increases in  xxxg2296xxx  in protein extracts of nasal
mucosa as well as found increases in  xxxg2296xxx + cell number in
np nasal mucosa.  xxxg2296xxx  has the capacity to induce cell
death via apoptotic pathway and induces inﬂammation in
local tissue. the present data imply an important role of
 xxxg2296xxx  in the pathogenesis of np and chronic rhinitis.

figure 6 seb promotes expression of m3 in dcs. peripheral dcs
were prepared and exposed to seb in culture at graded concentrations. m3 expression in dcs was analyzed by flow cytometry,
qpcr and western blotting. a–d, histograms indicate the m3+ dc
population. e, bars indicate m3 mrna expression in dcs that was
presented as percentage of b-actin. f, immune blots show m3 pro-

tein in dc cellular extracts. gel a: m3 protein; gel b: b-actin. each
experiment was repeated 3 times. g, scatter plots show the relation between the expression of  xxxg53xxx  mrna in isolated dcs
and the s. aureus colony numbers cultured from nasal mucosal
specimens.

it seems most inﬂammatory cells produce  xxxg2296xxx  upon
activation, which includes mast cells, th1 cells and th2 cells.
thus, the mechanism of activation of inﬂammatory cells is
important in studying the pathogenic mechanism of np and
chronic inﬂammation in the airway. hyperactivity of parasympathetic nerve in nasal mucosa is associated with both
allergic and nonallergic nasal inﬂammation (32). previous
studies indicate that m3 receptors are extensively distributed
on nasal mucosa, especially in the inferior turbinate (16, 17).
the  xxxg449xxx  is probably important in the physiology of
the human inferior turbinate. the cholinergic activities stimulate m3 muscarinic receptors on the submucosal glands to
cause the exocytosis and thick mucous discharge (16, 17). in
accordance with these previous reports, the present data
show that hyper expression of  xxxg449xxx  in nasal mucosa
of np patients with or without ar. furthermore, we found
that the expression of m3 receptors not only localized in

blood vessels and glands as reported previously, we also
unraveled that most immune cells also expressed m3 receptors, especially in dcs and cd4+ t cells.
parasympathetic nervous transmitters, such as acetylcholine, can bind m receptors to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase and subsequently initiate the signal transduction
pathway and activates the m receptor-bearing cells (33). in this
way, parasympathetic nervous system is involved in regulating
the immune function in the body, such as modulating the antibody production, inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration, and lymphocyte proliferation (34–36). the present data add a novel aspect
to the immune regulatory aspects of parasympathetic nervous
system that can drive immune cells to release inﬂammatory
mediators, e.g. exposure to mch induced the release of  xxxg2296xxx 
from cd4+ t cells isolated from np, but not those from nnp,
nasal mucosa as observed in the present study. collectively,
the data also suggest deregulation of parasympathetic activities

in the pathogenesis of np. to regulate the parasympathetic
function in nasal mucosa may be a potential therapeutic remedy for np that is worth further exploring.
ox40 and ox40l belong to the  xxxg2296xxx 
receptor/ xxxg2296xxx  superfamily; they are
expressed on activated lymphocytes and on a number of
other lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells (37). interaction of
ox40/ox40l modulates cytokine synthesis in immune cells
and is involved in the process of immune inﬂammation (38).
epithelial cell-derived tslp is a factor driving dcs to
express ox40l that further binds to ox40 on cd4+ t cells
to promote the production of inﬂammatory cytokine, such as
 xxxg2296xxx  (14). the present data indicate that, similar to tslp,
cholinergic activity can also up regulate the expression of
ox40l in dcs. because the innervations of parasympathetic
nerve are ubiquitously distributed in the body, apart from in
the subepithelial region where epithelial cell-derived tslp
can directly inﬂuence dc’s function, the cholinergic activity
may inﬂuence dc’s function, such as inducing the expression
of ox40l, in most part of the body.
the regulation of m receptor expression in immune cells is
unclear. our data provide a connection between s. aureus
colonization on nasal mucosa and  xxxg449xxx  expression in
dcs and cd4+ t cells in np nasal mucosa. additional evidence obtained in the present study is seb was detected in
over 90% np nasal mucosa. seb is a superantigen and has
high immune regulatory activity. our previous studies indicate that seb is involved in the initiation of skewed th2
response (18, 19). the present data add another novel point
to seb’s capacity on immune regulation by showing that
seb increases the expression of  xxxg449xxx  in dcs and
cd4+ t cells at mrna and protein levels.

based on the present data, we may envisage a scenario
that exposure to microbial products (such as seb) up regulates the expression of  xxxg449xxx  on nasal mucosal dcs
and cd4+ t cells. cholinergic agents activate  xxxg449xxx 
to induce dcs to release ox40l; the latter drives th2 cells
to express  xxxg2296xxx  (14). activation of m3 receptors on these
 xxxg2296xxx -producing th2 cells induce the release of  xxxg2296xxx  to
induce inﬂammation to occur in local tissue such as inducing
np formation (8).
in summary, the present study revealed that high levels of
 xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx + il-4+ t cells were detected in np nasal
mucosa. both dcs and il-4+ t cells expressed high levels of
 xxxg449xxx . interaction of mch/m3 increased the expression
of ox40l in dcs and the expression of  xxxg2296xxx  and il-4 in
cd4+ t cells. the present study demonstrates that dysregulation of parasympathetic function affects the immune system
in nasal mucosa and induces inappropriate immune responses
and eventually induces immune inﬂammation in the nasal
mucosa such as np.
