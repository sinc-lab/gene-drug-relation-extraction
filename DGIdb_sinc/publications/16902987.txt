background. the purpose of the current study was to determine the maximum
tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetic profile, and recommended phase ii dose of oral administration of tas-102, a novel nucleoside
formed by the combination of a,a,a- xxxd3434xxx  (ftd) and a thymidine
phosphorylase inhibitor (tpi: 5-chloro-6-(2-iminopyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl-2,4(1h,3h) xxxd3470xxx ).

methods. eligible patients had advanced solid tumors, adequate organ function,
and had not received anticancer therapy in the preceding 4 weeks. tas-102 was
administered orally once daily for 14 days, followed by a 1-week rest, repeated

every 3 weeks. the initial dose of tas-102 administered was 100 mg/m2/day. the
first 2 patients treated at that dose experienced substantial toxicity and, therefore,
lower dose levels of tas-102 were subsequently explored.

results. fourteen patients were enrolled; all patients were evaluable for toxicity
assessment and 12 were evaluable for response. the initial dose explored was
100 mg/m2/day, based on a preclinical monkey model. however, the first 2
patients experienced bone marrow suppression of grade 3 or 4 in course 1. the
protocol was amended to study the next cohort of patients at 50 mg/m2/day. at
this dose level no grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in course 1. in the subsequent dose level (60 mg/m2/day), 3 of 6 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia as dose-limiting toxicity. three additional patients for a total of 6
were enrolled at 50 mg/m2/day without occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity.
thus, 50 mg/m2/day was declared the maximum tolerated dose for this schedule.

conclusions. the authors’ study showed that 50 mg/m2/day was a tolerable
dose of the novel antimetabolite ftd in combination with an inhibitor of its
inactivating enzyme tp, and this is the recommended phase ii dose. evaluation
of this daily dose in malignancies for which fluoropyrimidines have failed is
needed. cancer 2006;107:1383–90.  2006 american cancer society.

ince the development of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), an antineoplastic
antimetabolite, in 1957, fluoropyrimidines have been the backbone of chemotherapy regimens used as treatment for colorectal,
breast, stomach, and head and neck cancers. 5-fu can be administered in different ways, but the continuous infusion regimens
appear to yield the best responses with the least toxicity. the use of
conventional 5-fu has been complicated, however, both by the
need for cumbersome central venous catheters, because long infusions are desirable, and a high incidence of tumor resistance with
the currently available agents, and therefore the development of a

newer, more convenient, and more effective oral
fluoropyrimidine would certainly be welcome.
the main antitumor mechanism of 5-fu appears
to be inhibition of the  xxxg2366xxx  enzyme
(ts) by 1 of its metabolites,  xxxd2117xxx 
monophosphate (fdump). this leads to inhibition of
dna synthesis,1 with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. a,a,a- xxxd3434xxx  (ftd), initially synthesized by heidelberger et al.2–6 in 1964, is a
well-known anti-neoplastic antimetabolite and is
believed to act as a ts inhibitor, similar to 5-fu.
additionally, ftd can be passively incorporated into
the dna of the cell and induce its fragmentation as
an alternative mechanism of cytotoxicity.7,8 phase i
and ii studies of the agent administered intravenously (i.v.) were begun in the late 1960s,2–5,9 but the
initial clinical trials were disappointing, with no
objective responses reported. one of the original
findings from the pharmacokinetic (pk) studies conducted in these trials was that ftd had a very short
serum half-life (12 minutes after injection), and
therefore a second schedule was explored (2.5 mg/
kg/day given i.v. in divided doses every 3 hours for
8–13 days). using this schedule, responses were
reported in 8 of 23 patients with breast cancer, and
an almost complete response was reported in 1 out
of 6 patients with colon cancer.10 unfortunately, the
responses were not maintained, with rapid recurrence seen after initial regression, generally before
the next scheduled course. attempts at using maintenance therapy were hindered by an unacceptable
level of bone marrow toxicity and the development
of the drug in oncology was discontinued.
despite setbacks in the development of ftd, it
was discovered that, when orally administered, it is
rapidly degraded to an inactive form, 5-trifluoromethyluracil or 5-trifluoromethyl-2,4(1h,3,h)- xxxd3470xxx  (fty), by the enzyme  xxxg2365xxx 
(tp). thus, it was theorized that the use of an inhibitor of tp (tpi: 5-chloro-6-(2-iminopyrrolidin-1-yl)
methyl-2,4(1h,3h)- xxxd3470xxx ) with ftd would
be able to maintain and raise ftd concentrations
in the body, leading to increased cytotoxicity.11,12
moreover, because it has been shown that tp is the
same protein as platelet-derived endothelial growth
factor ( xxxg2365xxx ), the inhibition of tp by tpi could
theoretically decrease tp-induced angiogenesis or
metastasis.13,14
tas-102 (taiho pharmaceutical, tokyo, japan)
is a novel antitumor nucleoside formed by the combination of 1 m ftd and 0.5 m tpi. the optimum
combination ratio of ftd to tpi was determined by
treating nude mice xenografted with human colorectal carcinoma dld-1. the study results indicated

that the combination of ftd with 0.5 or more
equivalents of tpi on a molar basis maximized the
antitumor activity of ftd without increasing adverse
reactions,14 and it showed greater effectiveness than
i.v. 5-fu therapy and oral uracil/ xxxd3301xxx  (uft) therapy14 in human tumor xenograft models of esophageal and pancreatic cancer in nude mice.15
on the basis of the encouraging preclinical data,
we initiated a phase i study in patients with advanced solid tumors. the primary objectives were to
determine the maximum tolerated dose (mtd),
dose-limiting toxicities (dlt), pk profile, and recommended phase ii dose of tas-102. a secondary objective was to document any possible antitumor
activity.

materials and methods
patient eligibility
eligible patients had a histologically or cytologically
confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor, with advanced
or metastatic disease refractory to standard therapy or
for which no standard therapy existed. other eligibility
criteria included age 18 years, performance status
2 on the zubrod scale, life expectancy 12 weeks,
absolute granulocyte count 1500/ml, platelet count
100,000/ml, and hemoglobin 9.0 g/dl. patients
had adequate liver function (bilirubin 1.5 mg/dl)
and adequate renal function (creatinine 1.5 mg/dl).
we required that transaminases be 2 times the
upper limit of normal (uln) except for patients with
liver metastasis whose transaminases could be 5 times
the uln. pregnant and breast-feeding women were
excluded from this study. patients with clinical signs of
brain involvement or leptomeningeal disease were not
eligible. all participants had recovered fully from surgery (at least 4 weeks had elapsed since major surgery)
and had received no chemotherapy or radiotherapy for
at least 4 weeks before study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and  xxxd2655xxx ). patients could not receive
concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy while participating in this study or treatment
with any other investigational drug (including antiemetics and pain medications) within the 28 days before
registration or while enrolled in the study. patients
all had measurable or evaluable disease. finally, all
patients were required to stay in the houston, texas,
area for the first course of treatment and to return to
m. d. anderson cancer center for evaluation before
the start of each subsequent course of treatment
with tas-102. all patients gave written informed consent and the institutional review board approved the
protocol.

evaluation of tas-102/hong et al.

pretreatment evaluation and sampling schedule
pretreatment evaluation included obtaining a computed tomography (ct) scan, chest x-ray (cxr), and
electrocardiogram (ecg) within 30 days of treatment
and a medical history, physical examination, and toxicity assessment, as well as laboratory tests (complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis) within 7 days of treatment. toxicity assessments and serum and chemistry profiles were
obtained before each course, weekly throughout the
study, and at the end of the study. the physical examination (including weight, performance status,
and vital signs) was also repeated before each course
and at the end of the study. tumor assessment by ct
scan was repeated after every 2 courses and at the
end of the study. toxicity grading was based on the
national cancer institute (nci) common toxicity
criteria v. 1.0. dlt was defined as the inability of the
patient to take 75% of the planned chemotherapy
dose during a treatment cycle or to begin the next
course of treatment within 2 weeks of the last dose
of drug due to unresolved toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia lasting 3 days, febrile neutropenia, grade 4
thrombocytopenia, grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea/vomiting), or grade 3 nausea
and vomiting uncontrolled by antiemetics.
pharmacokinetic sampling
clinical pk studies were performed in all consenting
patients in order to determine pk parameters of
ftd, fty, and tpi. these included half-life, maximum plasma concentration (cmax), auc, clearance,
and volume of distribution. during course 1, on days
1 and 14 whole blood samples were collected before
and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after
study drug administration. urine was collected 0–8
hours, 8–16 hours, and 16–24 hours after study drug
administration.
determination of plasma and urine levels
of ftd, fty, and tpi
plasma and urine concentrations of ftd, fty, and
tpi were determined by the validated high-performance liquid chromatography technique with ultraviolet (hplc) and mass spectrometric detection (lc/
ms/ms).
pharmacokinetic analyses
estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters of ftd
and tpi in plasma was performed by noncompartmental methods using winnonlin (v. 3.1; pharsight,
mountain view, ca) software. the maximum plasma
concentrations (cmax) and time to maximum plasma
concentrations (tmax) were determined from the
observed highest concentration and time of its

1385

occurrence. the area under the concentration-time
curve (auc0–24) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method from 0–24 hours. the elimination
half-life (t1/2) was estimated from ln(2)/ke, where the
terminal phase elimination rate constant (ke) estimated using log-linear regression during the terminal
phase. the oral clearance (cl/f) was calculated as
dose divided by auc, where auc equals auc0–? (0 to
infinity) on day 1, and auc0–24 on day 14. auc0–?
was calculated by adding the value cplast/ke to auc0–t,
where cplast was the last measurable plasma concentration and auc0–t was the area under the concentration-time curve 0 to last measurable sample. the
volume of distribution (vd) was calculated as cl/f
divided by ke. the percent of the dose of each compound excreted in urine over the 24-hour postdose
period was calculated. in addition, renal clearance
(clr) was calculated as the amount excreted in urine
divided by auc0–24.

treatment program
based on preclinical studies, tas-102 was given
orally once daily for 14 days, followed by a 1-week
rest, repeated every 3 weeks. the initial starting dose,
determined by one-third the 4-week monkey study
toxic low dose of 300 mg/m2/day, was 100 mg/m2/
day. at each dose level an initial cohort of 3 patients
was enrolled. no further dose escalation could occur
until 3 patients completed a course of therapy. the
initial patient at each dose higher than the starting
dose was observed for 3 weeks before the entry of
subsequent patients. no intrapatient dose escalation
was allowed. further rules for dose escalation were
as follows: if none of the initial 3 patients developed
dlt, dose escalation continued. if 1 of the initial
3 patients developed dlt, 3 additional patients were
entered at the same dose level. if none of the 3 additional patients treated at the same dose level developed dlt, dose escalation continued. if 2 or 3 of the
initial 3 patients treated at a dose level or 1, 2, or
3 of the additional 3 patients treated at a dose level
developed dlt, dose escalation ceased. up to 9 patients were to be treated at a dose that was 10 mg/
m2/day less than the dose with the unacceptable
number of dlts. doses were to be escalated by
20 mg/m2/day until grade 2 toxicity (other than alopecia) was noted. after grade 2 toxicity was noted,
subsequent escalations were to be continued by
10-mg/m2/day increments until the suggested phase
ii dose was determined. if tas-102 was withheld due
to toxicity during a course, those days were counted
as treatment days. compliance was determined by
counting the number of unused tablets at each return visit.

taiho pharmaceutical provided the tas-102 in
blister packets containing immediate-release, filmcoated tablets in which ftd and tpi were combined
at a molar ratio of 1:0.5. tablets were available in 100
mg and 20 mg tablets. uneven doses were rounded
to the closest 20 mg. patients took tas-102 orally
with 8 ounces of water each morning upon rising, at
approximately the same time each morning, on an
empty stomach, at least 1 hour before a meal.

results
a total of 14 patients were enrolled and treated in this
trial. their demographic and clinical characteristics
are shown in table 1. all patients had a primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer and had received from 2 to
8 prior treatment regimens. a majority of patients (13
patients; 92.9%) had undergone prior surgery, but only
8 patients (57.1%) had received prior radiation therapy. seven of the 14 patients had known liver metastases; however, none of these patients had elevated
transaminases on enrollment to the trial.
patients received 100% of the prescribed amount
of drug in 34 out of a total of 38 courses completed.
missed doses were secondary to a number of factors, including dlts, physician instructions, adverse

events (aes), and patients forgetting to take an occasional dose.
the initial 2 patients enrolled received tas-102
at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day, based on the preclinical
monkey model; however, both patients experienced
bone marrow suppression in course 1, considered
related to the study drug. one patient experienced
grade 3 anemia and the other experienced grade 4
granulocytopenia. pk analysis revealed an approximately 3-fold higher than expected (auc) for ftd
relative to that observed in preclinical studies in
monkeys, and therefore the starting dose was reduced to 50 mg/m2/day. an initial cohort of 3 patients received tas-102 at this dose. all patients
completed course 1 without dlt or dose reduction.
grade 2 toxicities were observed; therefore, the next
cohort of 3 patients was treated at a dose of 60 mg/
m2/day. one of these 3 treated at 60 mg/m2/day
developed dlt of grade 4 granulocytopenia; therefore, an additional 3 patients were treated at this
dose. dose escalation did not continue above the
60 mg/m2/day dose because 2 of the additional
patients experienced grade 4 granulocytopenia as
dlts. an additional 3 patients were then treated at
the 50 mg/m2/day dose to further characterize this
dose level. six patients each were evaluable for toxicity at the 50 mg/m2/day and 60 mg/m2/day doses,
and 2 were evaluable at the 100 mg/m2/day dose of
tas-102.
during the first course of tas-102, 4 of the 6
patients treated at the 50 mg/m2/day dose experienced toxicities (related aes) of maximum grade 1
and 2 patients experienced toxicities of maximum
grade 2. no patient in this group experienced toxicities grade 3 or 4. during the first course the most
frequently occurring (50% of patients) toxicities
were asthenia (100%), nausea (83.3%), and taste perversion (83.3%). during all courses, of the 6 patients
treated at the 50 mg/m2/day dose, 1 patient experienced a toxicity of maximum grade 3 granulocytopenia and 3 patients experienced toxicities of
maximum grade 4 granulocytopenia. the most frequently occurring (50% of patients) toxicities in all
courses were asthenia (100%), nausea (100%), taste
perversion (83.3%), and granulocytopenia (66.7%).
the most common toxicities secondary to drug effect
in all courses are presented in table 2.
six patients were treated at the 60 mg/m2/day
dose level. of these, 3 experienced grade 3 granulocytopenia (50%) and 2 experienced grade 4 (33.3%)

included abdominal pain (1 patient) and granulocytopenia (3 patients), and 3 patients experienced
grade 4 granulocytopenia. the most frequently
noted related toxicities in all courses were granulocytopenia (100%), asthenia (83.3%), nausea (66.7%), diarrhea (50%), and alopecia (50%).
of the 2 patients treated at the 100 mg/m2/day
dose, 1 experienced toxicity of maximum grade 3
(anemia), and 1 patient experienced toxicity of maximum grade 4 (granulocytopenia) during the first
course. the first patient went on to course 2, but
treatment was discontinued early secondary to grade
4 granulocytopenia.
during the study, 1 patient developed a serious
adverse event of intestinal obstruction (grade 4). this
was considered related to disease and not related to
study drug. a total of 14 patients discontinued the
therapy (12 due to progression of disease and 2 due
to unacceptable toxicity). of note, no deaths were reported secondary to drug effect.

efficacy analyses
response (complete response, partial response, no
change, progressive disease) was assessed for all evaluable patients. patients were evaluable for efficacy if
they completed 75% of the planned treatment for at
least 2 cycles. patients who had progressive disease
after a single course of therapy were also considered
evaluable for response.
no patient achieved a complete or partial response. four patients had no change in tumor size (2
at 50 mg/m2/day and 2 at 60 mg/m2/day), and 8
patients had progressive disease (four at 50 mg/m2/
day and four at 60 mg/m2/day) as their best response. the median time to treatment failure for all
patients was 57 days. the reasons for treatment failure were unacceptable toxicity for the 2 patients in

the 100 mg/m2/day group and progression of disease
for the 12 patients in the 50 and 60 mg/m2/day
groups.

pharmacokinetic analyses
tas-102 is a combination of ftd and tpi in a molar
ratio of 1:0.5. when ftd is given orally it degrades to
an inactive metabolite, fty. twelve patients completed the pk phase of this study (6 received the 50
mg/m2/day dose, 4 received the 60 mg/m2/day dose,
and 2 received the 100 mg/m2/day dose). the pk
values for ftd and tpi at each dose level are listed
in table 3.
ftd readily appeared in plasma, with tmax values
ranging from 0.506 to 1.33 hours (fig. 1). mean values
for ftd auc0–24 on day 14 at the 3 dose levels (50,
60, and 100 mg/m2/day) were higher than the values
for auc0–24 on day 1, indicating a change in the disposition of this compound after multiple doses. ftd
was rapidly eliminated from the plasma, and the
mean t1/2 values did not markedly change with dose
or time. approximately 1.0% to 16.7% of the administered dose was recovered unchanged in urine, indicating that the ftd was mainly eliminated by a
nonrenal route. fty, the inactive metabolite of ftd,
rapidly appeared in plasma and was steadily eliminated after oral administration of tas-102. no accumulation of this metabolite was observed after
multiple doses (data not shown).
tpi readily appeared in plasma and was steadily eliminated after oral administration of tas-102
(fig. 2). the mean cmax and auc0–24 values were
generally the same at doses of 50, 60, and 100 mg/
m2/day. no accumulation of this compound was
observed after multiple doses. approximately 2.46%
to 50.4% of the administered dose was recovered
unchanged in urine.

discussion

the initial reason for the development of the
combination of the active ftd compound with the
tp inhibitor in the form of tas-102 was the short
half-life of the ftd compound alone. heidelberger
et al.10 noted the mean half-life of ftd in the plasma
to be only 12 minutes. the pk studies showed that
indeed tpi increased the half-life of ftd to a mean
between 1.37 and 1.57 hours on day 1 and between
1.55 and 2.51 hours on day 14. this half-life is comparable to the half-life of the 5-fu generated by the
oral administration of s-1 or uft, which contain
gimeracil (cdhp) or uracil as an inhibitor of 5-fu
degradation, respectively. the mean half-life for tpi
ranged between 3.05 and 6.68 hours on day 1 and
between 1.50 and 7.46 hours on day 14. the ftd
auc mean values on day 14 at the 3 dose levels
(50, 60, and 100 mg/m2/day) were markedly higher
than on day 1, indicating a likely change in the
disposition of this compound and possible accumulation after multiple doses. this could explain the
increase in granulocytopenia observed over multiple

this is the first phase i trial of ftd combined with a
tp inhibitor. we determined that the mtd of tas102 is 50 mg/m2/day when administered to advanced
solid tumor patients daily for 14 days, followed by a
1-week rest.
the dlts observed in this study were granulocytopenia and anemia. the toxicity profile of tas-102
suggests that bone marrow toxicity remains the primary dlt of ftd (as previously reported by heidelberger et al.12) and that the addition of tpi does not
result in additional dlts. the toxicity profile differs
from that of other oral fluorinated pyrimidines, such
as  xxxd425xxx , where gastrointestinal (gi) toxicities
appear to predominate. up to 6 courses were given
at the determined phase ii dose of 50 mg/m2/day.
although no dlts were observed during course 1,
the data suggest that subsequent courses may lead
to an increase in dlt, specifically granulocytopenia,
which nonetheless seems to be responsive to the use
of g-csf.

courses. investigators will need to take this into
account in subsequent studies when long-term treatment is expected.
the abnormal accumulation of ftd in plasma
on day 14, not expected from its half-life at day 1,
was observed. at the present time it is not clear why
such an accumulation was observed. the accumulation does not appear to be secondary to tpi. this
was in contrast to the preclinical data that showed
no such accumulation in rat preclinical models. one
possibility is the induction of endogenous thymidine,
uridine, or other pyrimidines by the antimetabolite,
which may interfere with the catabolic pathways of
the parent drug. whether this will lead to clinical
problems in future phase i and phase ii trials is to
be determined. in the ongoing tas-102 phase i studies, dosages up to 180mg/m2, there was no fatal
case related to study drug, although the interindividual variability of ftd in plasma was observed
(unpubl. data). an ongoing phase i study in japan
will explore the levels of endogenous pyrimidines,
especially thymidine.
prior phase i studies exploring ftd showed no
clinical regressions,10,16 but the phase ii study by ansfield and ramirez17 showed partial responses in 8 of
23 patients with breast cancer and a complete response in 1 of 6 patients with colon cancer. our study
did not show any partial or complete responses; however, our patients were heavily pretreated, with an average of more than 4 prior treatments. a phase ii trial
is necessary to determine efficacy.
the fluoropyrimidine 5-fu has been the core of
chemotherapy regimens for a number of tumor types
for over 40 years. development of oral fluoropyrimidines, such as uft and  xxxd425xxx , has shown that
oral routes of antimetabolites may be as effective as
the intravenous route. resistance to fluoropyrimidines remains a serious problem, however. the
development of alternative antimetabolites may circumvent this resistance or the alternatives may show
increased efficacy compared to the 5-fu-based regimens. we have shown here that 50 mg/m2/day is a
tolerable dose of the novel antimetabolite ftd in
combination with an inhibitor of its inactivating
enzyme tp, and this is our recommended phase ii
dose. evaluation of this daily dose in malignancies
for which fluoropyrimidines have failed is needed.
