triiodothyronine and interleukin-6 (il-6) induce expression of hgf in an immortalized rat hepatic stellate cell line.  despite its being considered a primary mitogen for hepatocytes, triiodothyronine (t3) has no effect on the proliferation of hepatocytes in vitro, and in our studies, induces significant in vivo hepatocyte proliferation only during liver injury. we hypothesized that t3 may affect hepatocytes proliferation indirectly, by inducing other cells in the liver to secrete hepatic mitogens.
