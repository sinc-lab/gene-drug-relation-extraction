characterization of determinants of ligand binding to the  xxxg1026xxx   xxxg1026xxx  ( xxxg1026xxx /puma-g).  the g-protein-coupled receptor  xxxg1026xxx  ( xxxg1026xxx /puma-g) has recently been shown to function as a receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  (niacin) and to mediate its antilipolytic effects.  xxxd2715xxx  is able to strongly raise plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a property that distinguishes  xxxd2715xxx  from other lipid-lowering drugs. to investigate the structural determinants of  xxxg1026xxx  ligand binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of putative ligand binding residues combined with generation of chimeric receptors consisting of  xxxg1026xxx  and its close relative  xxxg1027xxx , which does not bind  xxxd2715xxx . we could identify asn86/trp91 [transmembrane helix (tmh) 2/extracellular loop (ecl) 1], arg111 (tmh3), ser178 (ecl2), phe276 (tmh7), and tyr284 (tmh7) as amino acid residues critical for binding of  xxxd2715xxx . together with data from molecular modeling studies, our data suggest that the ligand binding pocket for  xxxd2715xxx  of  xxxg1026xxx  is distinct from that of most other group a receptors. although arg111 at tmh3 serves as the basic anchor point for the carboxylate ligands, the ring system of  xxxd2715xxx  is embedded between trp91 at the junction tmh2/ecl1 and phe276/tyr284 at tmh7. the heterocyclic ring is also bound to ser178 at ecl2 via an h-bond. these data will facilitate the design of new antidyslipidemic drugs acting via  xxxg1026xxx .
