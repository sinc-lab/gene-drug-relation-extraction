behavioral, and reproductive neuroendocrine
responses to photoperiod and melatonin in
siberian hamsters (phodopus sungorus)

environmental day length drives nocturnal pineal melatonin secretion, which in turn generates or
entrains seasonal cycles of physiology, reproduction, and behavior. in mammals, melatonin (mel)
binds to a number of receptor subtypes including high-affinity (mt1 and mt2) and low-affinity
(mt3, nuclear orphan receptors) binding sites, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system and periphery. the mel receptors that mediate photoperiodic reproductive and behavioral responses to mel have not been identified in a reproductively photoperiodic species. here
i tested the hypothesis that mt1 receptors are necessary and sufficient to engage photoperiodic
responses by challenging male siberian hamsters (phodopus sungorus), a species that does not
express functional mt2 receptors, with  xxxd3078xxx  (ram), a specific mt1/ xxxg1477xxx  agonist. in
hamsters housed in a long-day photoperiod, late-afternoon ram treatment inhibited gonadotropin secretion, induced gonadal regression, and suppressed food intake and body mass, mimicking effects of mel. in addition, chronic (24 h/d) ram infusions were sufficient to obscure endogenous mel signaling, and these treatments attenuated gonadal regression in short days.
together, the outcomes indicate that signaling at the  xxxg1476xxx  is sufficient and necessary to
mediate the effects of photoperiod-driven changes in mel on behavior and reproductive function
in a reproductively photoperiodic mammal. (endocrinology 151: 714 –721, 2010)

easonal cycles in physiology and behavior are ubiquitous in nature and contribute to the etiology of psychiatric and infectious disease (1). changes in day length
(photoperiod) and in photoperiod-driven nocturnal melatonin (mel) secretion play a central role in the transduction of time-of-year information into the central nervous and neuroendocrine systems (2).
much of what is known about photoperiodic control of
the central nervous system (cns) has been derived from
the study of seasonal rhythms in mammalian reproduction. long- and short-duration mel signals are generated
in winter and summer, respectively (3), and over an interval of many weeks induce seasonal reproductive phenotypes (4, 5). two mel receptor subtypes, mt1 and mt2,
have been identified in mammals (6). several reports have

s

addressed the role of these receptors in circadian and seasonal biology. mt1 receptors bind mel in the brain and
pituitary of mice (7); however, both mt1 and mt2 receptors
have been implicated in the phase-shifting responses of the
circadian system to mel in mice (7, 8). evidence that siberian hamsters (phodopus sungorus) exhibit circadian phase
shifts and entrainment to mel points to the existence of
species differences in the necessity of mt2 receptors for circadian responses to mel (9), because siberian hamsters lack
a functional  xxxg1477xxx  (10).
evidence on the role of mt1 and mt2 in the reproductive response to photoperiod and mel is not consistent. high doses (30 mg/kg) of luzindole, an mt1/mt2
antagonist/ xxxd1422xxx , were without effect on hamster reproductive responses to photoperiod or mel (11),

suggesting that disruption of mel signaling at mt1/mt2
receptors is compatible with normal photoperiodic responses. in contrast, late afternoon injections of mel
elicit changes in ependymal cell layer expression of type ii
and type iii iodothyronine deiodinase mrna (dio2 and
dio3, respectively) in wild-type mice but fail to do so in
mice with targeted disruption of the  xxxg1476xxx  (12).
dio2 and dio3 enzymes have been implicated as early
mediators of mel-based photoperiod information into
the neuroendocrine system of photoperiodic rodents (12–
14). although a causal link between dio2/dio3 expression and reproductive photoperiodism has not been definitively established in mammals, dio2/dio3 expression
levels track photoperiod (13) and dio2/dio3 protein
products control t4 catabolism in a manner consistent
with a role in the transduction of photoperiod information
into the cns (15). additionally, mel may act at other
binding sites (low-affinity mt3 receptors, nuclear orphan
receptors) (16 –18) to mediate gonadal responses to
changes in photoperiod.
the recent availability of the mt1/mt2 agonist  xxxd3078xxx  (ram) may allow insight into the necessity and sufficiency of mt1 mel receptors in reproductive photoperiodism. ram acts on mt1 and mt2 receptors, with an
affinity three to 16 times higher than that of mel (19, 20),
and has no detectable affinity across a wide range of cns
ligand binding sites, including benzodiazepine, monoamine, and opiate receptors, nuclear receptors, ion channels, and transporters, including the mt3 receptor (19,
21). because siberian hamsters lack functional mt2 mel
receptors, the combination of using a specific mt1/mt2
agonist in conjunction with a natural mt2 knockout species provides a direct examination of the role of mt1 receptors in a reproductively photoperiodic organism.
if mt1 receptors are sufficient to mediate the effects of
mel on the reproductive system, then treatment of siberian hamsters with ram should inhibit gonadotropin secretion and induce gonadal regression similar in magnitude and latency to that elicited by mel. moreover, if
mt1 signaling is necessary to mediate effects of mel on
the reproductive system, then obscuring mt1 signaling
via constant-release (24 h) ram infusions should attenuate gonadotropin and reproductive responses to
photoperiod.

18 –21 d of age and raised two to four per cage (28 ⫻ 17 ⫻ 12
cm) under a 15-h light, 9-h dark photoperiod 关long day (ld);
lights off at 1800 h central standard time] with ad libitum
access to food and filtered water at all times. ambient temperature was 20 ⫾ 0.5 c, and relative humidity was 53 ⫾ 2%
throughout the experiment. three weeks before the initiation of
each experiment, hamsters were housed one per cage.

drugs and delivery
in experiment 1, mel ( xxxd2559xxx ; sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo) and ram 关 xxxd2589xxx -关2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahyrdo-2h-indeno关5,4-b兴furan-8-yl)ethyl兴propionamide; takeda
pharmaceuticals, n.a., deerfield, il兴 were delivered by mouth in a
small (100 –200 mg) piece of fresh apple, according to methods
described by hiebert et al. (22). the oral route of administration
permits drug delivery without the confounds of handling and injection stress on the circadian system. briefly, mel and ram were
each dissolved in 70% ethanol at concentrations of 3.5 mg/ml and
7 mg/ml, respectively. working solutions were protected from light
and stored at ⫺20 c until use. each day, fresh apple cubes were cut
and impregnated with 5 ␮l mel or ram solution, and the ethanol
solvent was then evaporated at room temperature for 30 min before
feeding. final dosing was 0.5 mg/kg mel and 1 mg/kg ram, which
lie within the effective range for inducing gonadal regression in
siberian hamsters and inducing phase advances in circadian locomotor activity in rats when given in a single daily oral dose (21, 22).
control treatments consisted of apples impregnated with 5 ␮l 70%
ethanol. before the onset of drug treatments, hamsters were habituated to the feeding protocol for 1 wk with  xxxd102xxx treated apples.
in experiment 2, hamsters were administered mel or ram
via constant release miniosmotic pumps (200 ␮l vol; 0.25 ␮l/h
delivery rate; alzet 2004 model; alza corp., mountain view,
ca) while concurrently exposed to ld or short day (sd; 9-h
light, 15-h dark cycle) photoperiods. mel and ram were dissolved in ethanolic saline vehicle to concentrations of 0.24 and
0.48 ␮g/␮l, respectively, and delivered sc in surgically implanted
osmotic minipumps according to the manufacturer’s instructions. final dosing was 1.27 ␮g mel/d and 2.53 ␮g ram/d. this
amount of mel is sufficient to induce gonadal regression when
administered daily to male siberian hamsters (4); no previous
data are available concerning ram concentrations necessary
and sufficient to elicit reproductive responses. control miniosmotic pumps were loaded with vehicle (14% ethanol in 0.9%
saline). miniosmotic pumps were implanted under 3% isoflurane anesthesia at wk 0 and were replaced at wk 4 with identical
pumps. treatments continued through wk 8.

somatic, reproductive, and behavioral measures
estimated testis volumes (etvs) were determined on wk 0
and 4 in experiment 1, and on wk 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 in experiment
2. etvs were obtained by measuring the length and width of the
left testis through the abdominal skin with analog calipers (to 0.1
mm) while under light isoflurane anesthesia. in hamsters, etv is
positively correlated with testis weight, circulating testosterone,
and spermatogenesis (23, 24). in experiment 1, food in the cage
hopper was weighed (to 0.1 g) weekly to obtain a measure of food
intake. in experiment 2, hamsters were euthanized via co2 inhalation on wk 8, and paired testes weights were determined (to
0.1 mg). all hamsters were weighed (to 0.1 g) weekly.

circadian locomotor activity
circadian locomotor activity was monitored during the final
10 –14 d of experiment 1 (wk 3– 4). home cage activity data were
collected using passive infrared motion detectors (coral plus;
visonic, bloomfield, ct) positioned 22 cm above the cage floor.
motion detectors registered activity whenever three of 27 zones
were crossed. activity triggered closure of an electronic relay,
which was recorded by a pc running clocklab software (actimetrics, evanston, il). the timing of activity was analyzed using
clocklab software according to methods described by evans et
al. (25). a 24-h histogram was produced for each hamster by
averaging activity counts in 5-min bins over a 7- to 10-d window
between wk 6 and 8. for each histogram, activity onset was
defined as the point in the activity profile after 1400 h with
average counts exceeding the daily overall mean level and sustained above the daily mean for at least 30 min. activity offset
was defined as the last time point exceeding this threshold (25).
the phase angle of entrainment (␺r,l) to the light-dark cycle was
calculated as the difference between the onset of darkness and the
onset of activity (positive values indicate activity onset before
lights off).

blood sampling
at the end of experiment 1 (wk 4), and 1 wk before the end
of experiment 2 (wk 7), blood samples (500 ␮l) were collected
4 –5 h before lights-off under light isoflurane anesthesia from the
right retroorbital sinus using heparinized natelson collection
tubes. blood collections were performed in a room separate from
the general animal colonies, and hamsters were separated from
the colony until all blood collections for the day were completed.
animal handling during the blood collection was kept to a
minimum (⬍1 min). after collection, blood samples remained
on ice less than 1 h and were centrifuged at 300 ⫻ g for 30 min
at 4 c. plasma was stored at ⫺80 c until assayed for fsh
concentrations.

plasma fsh concentrations were determined in duplicate in
a single assay with rfsh rp-3 as standard and antirat fsh 11
antibody (national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases, rockville, md), as previously described (26, 27)
and validated for use in this hamster species (26, 27). the lower
limit of detection was 0.5 ng/ml, and the intraassay coefficient of

in experiment 1, 4 wk of late-afternoon mel treatments
inhibited fsh secretion, induced gonadal regression, and
suppressed food intake and body mass, confirming and extending other work in this species (22). these effects can be
attributed to an extension of the endogenous pattern of
short-duration nocturnal mel secretion into a longer mel
signal, which mimics that generated under a sd photoperiod
(5). in experiment 2, 8 wk of treatment with 24-h/d mel
attenuated the effects of sd on fsh secretion and reproductive condition. discrete, long-duration mel signals are substantially more inhibitory than chronic, 24-h mel signals;
the latter lack a daily mel-free interval (28) and obscure the
endogenous short-day pattern of mel secretion (29, 30).
this masking of endogenous mel signaling was responsible
for the attenuated reproductive responses to sd in hamsters
bearing mel implants (31). in both experiments 1 and 2,
treatment with the mt1/mt2 agonist ram mimicked the
effects of mel on reproductive physiology and hormone
secretion, food intake, and body mass. in light of the functional inadequacy of the  xxxg1477xxx  subtype in this species
(10), the data indicate that photoperiod signal transduction
through the mt1 mel receptor is sufficient to induce seasonal reproductive, behavioral, and somatic responses to
photoperiod.
daily oral administration of ram yielded significant
phase advances in the circadian locomotor activity
rhythm, consistent with previous reports in rats (21) and
humans (32) indicating efficacy at concentrations of 1
mg/kg and lower (33). when administered daily, the concentration of mel required to entrain the circadian clock
greatly exceeds that required to induce gonadal regression
(micrograms vs. nanograms) in siberian hamsters (4, 34)
and syrian hamsters (29, 35). if a similar relation obtains
for all mel receptor ligands, then the identification of a
ram concentration sufficient to entrain/phase-advance
the circadian system increased the likelihood that such a
concentration was above a value minimally sufficient for
engaging the mel-sensitive hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. indeed, this appeared to be the case.

ram implants would have constituted evidence in support of non-mt1-mediated mel signaling in the photoperiodic control of reproduction. this was not observed,
however. instead, against a background of mild reproductive inhibition (induced by the constant-release implant),
obscuring mel signaling at the  xxxg1476xxx  only, via
ram treatment, abolished the effects of photoperiod, preventing both sd-induced gonadal regression and ld-induced gonadal maintenance. together, this pattern of outcomes suggests that any non- xxxg1476xxx -mediated
signaling by endogenous mel is functionally irrelevant to
the photoperiodic control of reproduction in this species.
recent work in a reproductively non-photoperiodic
mammalian model 关wild-type and mel receptor-deficient
(mt1⫺/⫺ and mt2⫺/⫺) c3h mice兴 also implicate mt1
receptors in the transduction of mel signals into changes
in expression of t4 catabolism enzymes (dio2 and dio3)
at the hypothalamo-hypophyseal level (12). photoperiodic changes in dio3 expression were evident in wild-type
and mt2⫺/⫺ c3h mice but were abolished in mt1⫺/⫺
mice; both dio2 and dio3 responses to mel treatments
were absent in mt1⫺/⫺ mice (12). several parallels exist
between photic regulation of dio in reproductively photoperiodic mammalian species and those evident in reproductively non-photoperiodic species (e.g. inbred mice) after manipulations of photoperiod (36, 37). however, no
evidence of photic or melatonergic regulation of seasonal
behavior, body mass, gonadotropin secretion, or reproductive physiology exists in inbred mouse models of seasonality. moreover, it is not known whether photoperiodic or mel-driven changes in dio2 and dio3 expression
in mice would exceed a threshold sufficient to engage seasonal phenotypic changes in behavioral or gonadotropic
effector pathways in the brain and pituitary. lastly, clear
species differences in the mel receptor subtypes sufficient
to mediate effects of mel on the circadian system do not
encourage a priori confidence that mel engages the seasonal photoperiodic system via similar mel receptor subtypes in mice and hamsters. although work in models with
targeted deletion of specific receptor subtypes provides
important insights into photic regulation of dio expression, the present report provides evidence, in a reproductively photoperiodic mammalian species, that photoperiodic changes in gonadotropin secretion, reproductive
condition, behavior (food intake), and body mass are mediated by the mt1 mel receptor.
although the present report cannot categorically exclude a role for non-mt1 receptors in seasonal biology,
any such mel signaling seems unlikely to play a major
role in the induction of the seasonal reproductive and energetic phenotype in this species. in experiment 2, hamsters were housed in ld or sd and received a 24-h ram

signal that occluded only the mt1/mt2 receptors. hamsters were pineal intact; therefore, any endogenously generated mel signals should have been free to communicate
photoperiod-specific (i.e. short or long) mel signals at
putative extra-mt1/mt2 targets. if any such signaling
impacted the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, then
reproductive responses in ld-ram and sd-ram hamsters would have been expected to diverge. however, gonadotropin and reproductive responses in these two
groups were indistinguishable, further supporting the conclusion that mel signaling at receptors other than mt1
appears to be functionally irrelevant. whether data obtained in this species extrapolates to other photoperiodic
seasonal breeders (e.g. sheep and syrian hamsters) cannot
be determined from the present data set, but the available
data suggest that the data may be generalizable. in sheep,
mt2 is undetectable in the majority of breeds (38 – 40),
and among breeds in which mt2 is detectable (han
sheep), a disrupted sequence likely renders it incapable of
binding mel (41). moreover, a number of functional
polymorphisms in the structure of the  xxxg1476xxx  have
been associated with the timing of seasonal breeding in
sheep (42– 45), suggesting that mt1 is the major mediator of ovine reproductive responses to mel. it is
unknown whether the  xxxg1477xxx  is functional in
syrian hamsters.
in summary, the present study demonstrated that mt1/
mt2 agonist treatments that were timed so as to summate
with endogenous mel induced gonadal regression and the
short-day phenotypes in several photoperiodic traits in ld
hamsters; in addition, ram infusions that obscured endogenous mel signals attenuated gonadal regression in sd. respectively, these outcomes indicate that signaling at the mt1
receptor is sufficient and is necessary to mediate effects of
photoperiod-driven changes in mel on seasonal changes in
behavior and reproductive function in a reproductively photoperiodic mammal.
