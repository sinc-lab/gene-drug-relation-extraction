pharmacology and chemistry of  xxxd77xxx 
braham shroot, phd, and serge michel, phd sophia antipolis, france

background: refinoid research in the field of dermatology has been influenced by the clinical success of topical tretinoin and oral isotrefinoin in the treatment of acne, and by the discovery of high-affinity binding proteins for refinoic acid mediating its action and interaction
with other vitamins and hormones)
objective: we sought molecules with an optimal balance between stability, efficacy, and local tolerance for topical acne therapy.
methods: in vitro and in vivo bioassay systems were used to test the abifity of retinoids to
modulate cell proliferation and diferentiafion. in addition, anfiinflammatory properties were
assessed. binding and transactivation assays were used to compare affmities and transcriptional activities of  xxxd77xxx  and tretinoin for the nuclear transcription factors,  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors (rars).
results and conclusion:  xxxd77xxx  is a stable naphthoic acid derivative with potent retinoid pharmacology, controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition it has significant anfiinflammatory action. the nuclear gene transcription factors rar[3 and rare/
mediate the retinoid activity of  xxxd77xxx .
(j am acad dermatol 1997;36:$96-103.)
retinoid action of  xxxd77xxx  on cell proliferation
and differentiation is mediated by  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors (rar)-binding proteins and gene transactivation. a potent comedolytic effect in vivo was
observed after topical administration to the rhino
mouse. enhanced antiinflammatory action compared to the natural retinoids, tretinoin and isotretinoin, may partially explain improved tolerance in
vivo. these data led to the selection of  xxxd77xxx  for
development as a topical therapy for acne.
fig. 1 depicts the chemical structure of several retinoids. a progression is traced from the flexible,
photo-labile conjugated double bond array (tretinoin
[i], isotretinoin [ii],  xxxd2071xxx  []]i]) to the fully aromatic naphthalene derivatives (ttnn [iv],  xxxd77xxx  iv]).
in acne, the normal program of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation is disturbed in the pilosebaceous duct or the epidermis. this is accompanied by a chronic inflammatory component, bacterial colonization, with the involvement of the immune
system. we tested molecules for their ability to

modify all three factors to select the best candidates
for potency and local tolerance.
modifications in the chemical structure of the
natural product, tretinoin [i], were initially made to
increase the biologic half-life of the chemically and
biochemically labile parent substance. although this
gave rise to another drug,  xxxd2071xxx  [1]i], its use in the
management of psoriasis was impaired by its long
residence time in the body and by a lack of topical
efficacy.
 xxxd77xxx ,  xxxd77xxx  [v], was selected from our
program 2 as the best choice as a locally active potent
drug with high stability (figs. 2 and 3) and a low local side-effect profile as compared with tretinoin.

subco~]uency in a low calcium semi-defined culture
medium. the expression of transglutaminase (tgasei),
one of the enzymes responsible for the formation of
comified envelopes, was induced by culturing the cells for
4 days in high calcium medium. at the same time, retinoids were added to the medium.  xxxg744xxx  i expression by
nhk was determined using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (elisa).
hela cell proliferation s
hela cells were seeded at low density in fetal calf serum-supplemented medium. they were then treated for
4 days with the retinoids. the antiproliferate potential of
retinoids was then determined using a marker of mitochondrial activity (xty assay).
reconstructed skin 6
demlal equivalents or collagen lattices were prepared.
nhks were seeded onto the collagen lattice, and the cultures were kept submerged for 1 week and raised at the
air liquid interface during the second week. retinoids
were then added to the culture medium. the morphology
of the reconstructed skin was assessed by histology. indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed on
cryostat sections using monoclonal antibodies directed
against keratin k10 and filaggrin.
r a r binding assay 7
cos-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors
coding for human rarol, rar[5, and rar% nuclear
extracts were then prepared and used for competition
binding experiments using a stable reference retinoid analogue [3h]-cd367. bound and free ligands were separated by high performance size exclusion chromatography (hpsec).
functional transactivation assay 7
hela cells were cotransfected with expression vectors
for either human  xxxg1933xxx ~, rar[5, or rare/and with the
tre3-tk-cat reporter plasmid. they were then grown

for 24 hours in the presence of retinoids. cat expression
was determined using an elisa technique.
in vivo assays
rhino mouse model s
the rhino mouse is a mutant. at the age of 7 to 8 weeks
it loses hair, and the hair follicle ducts widen and accumulate keratin and other proteins to give rise to utricules
that resemble the microcomedo of human ache. reduction in the size of these utricles by topical application of
retinoids for 3 weeks was assessed by using a standardized image analysis technique on vertical actions.
epidermal  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) assay 9
epidermal odc activity was induced by cellulose tape
strippings of the skin of hairless rats: topical application
of refinoids immediately after the tape stripping significantly inhibited the induction of odc determined 6 hours
later.
mouse ear edema after topical application of
 xxxd208xxx  1°
retinoids were incorporated into the  xxxd208xxx 
solution, and the edema was measured 2 hours after application.
results
 xxxd77xxx  modulates cellular
differentiation

the in vitro screening models used have been described previously (table i). a characteristic property o f retinoids is their capacity to modulate cellular differentiation. depending on the cell type, but
also on physiologic, pathologic, and in vitro culture
conditions, this modulation can result either in inhibition oa" inhibition of differentiation.

 xxxd77xxx  induces differentiation of mouse
embryonal carcinoma cells
treatment of the murine embryonal carcinoma
cell line f9 with  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) results in the induction of an epithelium accompanied
by the secretion of specific markers, plasminogen
activator and laminin, indicating that f9 stem cells
are converted to endoderm-like cells. secretion of
 xxxg1766xxx  in the medium is
readily quantified in this system) fig. 4 shows the
dose response curves of plasminogen activator induction in f9 cells treated with atra and  xxxd77xxx . in this test,  xxxd77xxx  was at least three times
more active than  xxxd3417xxx .

 xxxd77xxx  inhibits keratinocyte
transglutaminase in vitro
in cultured keratinocytes,  xxxd3417xxx  suppresses
the expression of plasma membrane-associated enzyme transglutaminase type i. this enzyme catalyzes the formation of a comified envelope beneath
the plasma membrane during the final stages of differentiation. the effect of an increasing concentration of  xxxd3417xxx  or  xxxd77xxx  on the expression
of  xxxg744xxx  i can be quantified with an elisa. 4 as
shown in fig. 5, the concentration of  xxxd77xxx  leading to half-maximum inhibition (ics0 value)  xxxg744xxx 
i expression is 2.5 nmol/l. in this test  xxxd77xxx  was
10-fold more potent than  xxxd3417xxx .

 xxxd77xxx  has an antiproliferative effect
hela cells, derived from a cervical carcinoma, are
highly proliferative. they can be used to assay the
antiproliferative activity ofretinoids. 5 this effect can

be conveniently quantified by assessing mitochondrial activity with the ~
assay. tretinoin, isotretinoin, and  xxxd77xxx  inhibited cell proliferation with
equal potency in this test system.
as shown in table i, the potency of  xxxd77xxx  is
either equivalent or superior to that of the other retinoids. these data may be explained by two phenomena. first,  xxxd77xxx  is more stable than atra.
second,  xxxd77xxx  has a different binding profile than
cellular and nuclear refinoic acid binding proteins.

effect of  xxxd77xxx  on reconstructed skin
 xxxd77xxx  was able to modify epidermal morphogenesis and keratinocyte differentiation in a reconstructed skin model. the morphologic feature of
the reconstructed epidermis and the expression of
keratinocyte-specific differentiation markers, keratin
k10 and filaggrin, were modulated in a dose-dependent manner by both  xxxd77xxx  and tretinoin. 6 in a
preliminary study, using a commercially available
reconstructed skin system,  xxxd77xxx  had a benef'lcial effect on the survival of the reconstructed skin
(fig. 6). tretinoin at equal concentration was less
effective.

animal pharmacology
human acne vulgafis is characterized by an
altered profile of cellular proliferation and differentiation. the ability of  xxxd77xxx  to alter these cellular functions is consequently a prerequisite for its
action in the treatment of this disease.
 xxxd77xxx  has comedolytic activity
utricles packed with comified debris are present
in the epidermis of the rhino mouse, which gives

rise to its wrinkled appearance. topical application
of  xxxd77xxx  produced a dose-related reduction of
the number of utricles. 8 this activity was similar or
superior to tretinoin. i n contrast, the intercomedo
epidermal hyperplasia response was lower for  xxxd77xxx  than tretinoin (fig. 7).

 xxxd77xxx  has antiproliferative activity
the induction of odc activity9 is a prerequisite
for de novo dna synthesis, essential for increased
cell proliferation. topical  xxxd77xxx  significantly
inhibited adhesive tape-stripped--induced epidermal odc activity in the hairless rat. the observed
inhibition was comparable or superior to isotretinoin
and  xxxd2071xxx  but inferior to tretinoin.

 xxxd77xxx  has anti-inflammatory activity
 xxxd77xxx  pharmacology was further explored in
terms of its antiinflammatory activity. polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration and  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism are two factors associated with a wide
variety of cutaneous inflammatory reactions.  xxxd77xxx  significantly inhibited peripheral human
blood polymorphonuclear chemotactic and chemokinetic responses to the peptide f-met-leu-phe. the
5- and 15-1ipoxygenase pathways for the generation
of mono, di, and trihydroxylated metabolites of
 xxxd208xxx  (including leukotrienes of the a, b,
c, d, e, and f families, hete's, and the lipoxins)
were significantly inhibited by  xxxd77xxx  (fig. 8).
the anticyclooxygenase activity of  xxxd77xxx  as determined in vitro using homogenates of rat seminal
vesicles was at least 100 times less than for the 5- and
15-1ipoxygenases.
a single topical application of  xxxd208xxx  to
the mouse ear induces an inflammation attributable
to both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products.10, 11 the resulting edema can be inhibited by
topical administration of nonsteroidal anfiinflanmm-

tory drags such as indomethacin, and weakly inhibited by the corticosteroid betamethasone 17-valerate.
in this model of acute inflammation, topical  xxxd77xxx  had activity comparable to indomethacin and
betamethasone 17-valerate. under similar test conditions, tretinoin was inactive.

 xxxd77xxx  and the retinoid signalling
pathway
retinoids exert their pronounced effect on gene
expression by binding to a class of transcription enhancer/repressor factors that belong to the ligandactivated  xxxg1594xxx  superfamily.
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor subtypes rarol, [3, and "y and
retinoid x receptor subtypes rxrol, 13, and -y bind
as hetero-dimers to the promoter region of retinoid
sensitive genes (for review, see reference 1). in addition, rxr can homodimerize or form heterodimers
with other members of the receptor superfamily such
as the  xxxg2412xxx . in a particular cell, the response to a given retinoid may depend on the
expression pattern of receptor subtypes and the nature of the cognate response elements. the latter
consist of direct repeats of six nucleotides of the
general motif pugg/ttca with variable spacing (1
to 5 nucleotides). it is therefore not surprising that
retinoids that bind selectively to rxr have a
distinctly different profile than ligands that bind to
rars. certain synthetic ligands bind to rar subtypes with different selectivity; consequently subtle
differences are anticipated in their activity. rednoid
receptors can also act indirectly without binding to
dna. it has been proposed that a protein complex
is formed between an rar subtype and the jurdfos
protein complex preventing the latter from binding
to its cognate dna binding sites termed ap-1. the

ap-1 system is induced by phorbol esters or uv
light; thus, retinoids with affinity to rars may inhibit this induction.
at the molecular level,  xxxd77xxx  has a receptor
affinity profile distinct from tretinoin or isotretinoin;
it displays a rar[3, "y affinity profile and does not
bind to cytosolic  xxxd3417xxx  binding proteins
(crabp). molecular modelling shows that  xxxd77xxx  cannot bind efficiently to crabp ii as a result of steric hindrance occasioned by the adamantyl
function. a low affinity for the transport proteins
crabp i and ii may not reflect potency differ-

ences 12 but improved tolerance. this observation
was confirmed in a clinical study in which a solution
of  xxxd77xxx  was applied under occlusion to human
skin for 4 days. the treatment did not lead to
erythema or affect epidermal morphology. in contrast  xxxd3417xxx  induced erythema and epidermal hyperplasia and spongiosis under the same conditions. biochemical action had occurred because
both drags induced an early indicator of retinoid action, namely crabpi113 m-rna expression.
 xxxd77xxx  has higher affinity for rar[3 and

furthermore, transactivation by rxro~ is unaltered
by  xxxd77xxx  indicating that this retinoid is most
likely a rar selective ligand.
we have shown that the ability of  xxxd77xxx  to
modify cell differentiation and proliferation can be
abrogated by an rar[3, -¢ antagonist. that the
rar'y subtype is predominantly expressed in the
epidermis has been demonstrated. 14 selective agonists such as  xxxd77xxx  will serve as pharmacologic
tools to probe the events occurring between the
docking of a ligand to its receptor, their interaction
with dna, with dimerization parmers and the subsequent initiation of the machinery of gene transcription to produce different profdes of effector/

suppressor proteins that ultimately give rise to the
biologic events.
