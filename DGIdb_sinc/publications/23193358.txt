fibronectin and laminin are clinically relevant plasmin receptors in the eye. located at the vitreoretinal interface, they are cleaved
by  xxxd2767xxx  ( xxxd2767xxx , thrombogenics, iselin, nj), a novel ophthalmic medication. a series of clinical trials to study
 xxxd2767xxx  for the treatment of vitreoretinal diseases such as vitreomacular traction, macular hole, and exudative age-related
macular degeneration are underway. the results are promising and may impact patient care.

1. introduction
the vitreous occupies approximately 80% of the eye and is
composed of water, collagen fibers, and  xxxd2289xxx  [1].
in children, the vitreous is normally attached to the retinal
surface and relatively innocuous. with aging, the vitreous
physiologically liquefies and separates from the retina in a
process called posterior vitreous detachment (pvd). the
strongest points of vitreoretinal attachment are at the optic
nerve, central retina (macula), blood vessels, and ora serrata.
at any age, the vitreous can be abnormally adherent
to the macula, leading to sight-threatening diseases such as
vitreomacular traction and macular hole [2, 3]. vitreomacular traction is also implicated in the worsening of diabetic
retinopathy and exudative age-related macular degeneration
(amd). traditionally, diseases of the vitreoretinal interface
have been treated with surgery to mechanically detach the
vitreous from the retina and improve vision.
vitreous surgery carries inherent risks such as bleeding,
infection, retinal detachment, and accelerated cataract formation. furthermore, inducing vitreous separation from the
retina, particularly in the setting of an abnormal vitreoretinal
interface, is among the most technically challenging and
dangerous steps of vitreous surgery. therefore, pharmacological vitreolysis has been an important research goal in
ophthalmology [4].
 xxxd2767xxx  ( xxxd2767xxx , thrombogenics, iselin,
nj) is a medicine that may be injected into the vitreous and
administered in an oﬃce setting. it is a new technique to

pharmacologically induce a posterior vitreous detachment
by cleaving the extracellular matrix that adheres the vitreous
to the internal limiting membrane of the retina [5–7]. the
biomedical rationale and status of  xxxd2767xxx  for vitreoretinal diseases are discussed herein.

2. plasmin receptors in the eye
plasmin, the key enzyme of the fibrinolytic cascade, is also
known to cleave other extracellular matrix components,
specifically laminin and fibronectin [8–10]. in the eye, both
molecules localize to the vitreoretinal interface, where they
are postulated to play a central role in the adherence of
collagen fibers between the vitreous and the internal limiting
membrane (ilm) [11–17].
early work showing the eﬃcacy of plasmin in inducing a
posterior vitreous detachment (pvd) was largely performed
in rabbit eyes. verstraeten et al. [18] initially demonstrated
that intravitreal injection of plasmin followed by mechanical
core vitrectomy successfully induced a pvd, as was later
confirmed by histologic analysis. hikichi et al. [19] aiming
to avert the need for vitrectomy, subsequently combined
intravitreal injection of plasmin with sf6 gas into rabbit
eyes to successfully create a pvd without any signs of retinal
toxicity. interestingly, plasmin given alone was not suﬃcient
to induce pvd in either study [18, 19]. in contrast to the
previous reports, which investigated the intraocular eﬀects of
plasmin after only 1 week, kim et al. [20] followed plasmininjected rabbit eyes for 4 months, with no significant toxicity

observed. additionally, they showed that plasmin alone was
suﬃcient to produce a clean separation between the vitreous
cortex and retina [20].
gandorfer et al. [21] demonstrated that the degree of
vitreoretinal separation induced by plasmin directly correlates with the concentration as well as length of exposure
to the enzyme. porcine eyes exposed to 1 unit of plasmin
for 30 minutes had a dense network of residual collagen
fibrils covering the ilm, while those exposed to 1 unit
of plasmin for 60 minutes had only sparse collagen fibrils
remaining. furthermore, eyes treated with 2 units of plasmin
for 60 minutes had a smooth retinal surface on postmortem
examinations, consistent with a bare ilm. a later study by
the same group was the first to duplicate these results in
human cadaver eyes, and without any evidence of induced
retinal damage [22].
li et al. [23] separately investigated administration of
intravitreal plasmin injections in human cadaver eyes. using electron microscopy, they observed progressively less
evidence of vitreous collagen fibers on the retinal surface
with increasing doses of plasmin administered (1, 2, and 3
units) without producing morphological changes or acute
toxicity to the inner retina. through immunocytochemical
labeling techniques, they were also able to demonstrate that
treatment with plasmin dramatically decreased the density
of fibronectin and laminin at the ilm. uemura et al. [24]
additionally confirmed through western blot analyses that
fibronectin and laminin were degraded by plasmin to several
fragments of lower molecular weight in the ilms collected
from patients with macular holes or cystoid macular edema
who underwent vitrectomy.
cleavage of fibronectin and laminin may actually oﬀer
only a partial explanation to the molecular basis of pharmacologic vitreous detachment. given that laminin and
fibronectin are present at other ocular tissues beyond the
vitreoretinal interface, such as the lens, ciliary body, retinal
vessels, and lamina cribrosa [14], how is it that intravitreal
plasmin injection can induce a pvd without adversely
aﬀecting these other structures? the answer may lie in
plasmin’s additional ability to activate endogenous matrix
metalloproteinases (mmp), namely  xxxg1428xxx  ( xxxg1428xxx ),
which normally reside within the vitreous in their proenzyme state [25–30]. due to its aﬃnity for various collagens,
notably basement membrane type iv, activation of  xxxg1428xxx 
by exogenous plasmin likely contributes to the formation of
pvd [26].
beyond creating a pvd, brown et al. [27] showed that
experimentally injected active  xxxg1428xxx -cleaved bovine vitreous collagen and concluded that  xxxg1428xxx  activity could be
considered a potential mechanism for the vitreous liquefaction seen in aging as well as various pathologic states. animal
studies suggest that plasmin, likely through activation of
 xxxg1428xxx , may also liquefy the vitreous and be of particular
benefit as an adjunct to small-gauge vitrectomy systems.
this, in turn, may facilitate both easier and increased vitreous removal during vitrectomy, while shortening duration
of surgery. staubach et al. [31] measured a greater reduction
in the wet weight of enucleated porcine eyes injected with
plasmin compared with controls once the vitreous was

journal of biomedicine and biotechnology
removed by core vitrectomy. corroborating these findings,
hermel et al. [32] observed a 27% increase in rate of vitreous
removal through a 25-gauge cutting system in rabbit eyes
injected with plasmin as compared with no injection.
clinically, autologous plasmin has been utilized as an
adjunct to vitrectomy in numerous patient cohorts. given
the robust vitreoretinal adhesion in pediatric patients, trese
and colleagues investigated the utility of plasmin-assisted
vitrectomy in the repair of traumatic macular holes [33, 34],
stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity [35], and complicated xlinked retinoschisis [36], reporting successful anatomic outcomes in all groups. the use of plasmin-assisted vitrectomy
to treat stage 3 full-thickness macular holes has revealed
higher rates of spontaneous pvd noted intraoperatively in
conjunction with reduction in overall surgery time [24, 37–
39]. other investigators employing preoperative plasmin in
cases of tractional diabetic macular edema found higher
incidences of spontaneous pvd at the time of surgery [40,
41], less suction required to create a pvd when needed [42],
and improved postoperative visual outcomes compared with
controls [41]. hirata et al. [43] observed that plasmin pretreatment in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy
resulted in significantly less surgical time and a decreased risk
for iatrogenic retinal breaks.
unfortunately, autologous plasmin has several shortcomings which limit its feasibility for routine clinical practice.
first, it is not readily available, and the process to obtain it
is time-consuming and expensive. autologous plasminogen
must be harvested from the patient’s own blood, then
converted by streptokinase to plasmin in vitro prior to use.
second, this procedure must be done immediately before
surgery as plasmin is exceedingly unstable and rapidly
inactivates itself via autolysis and binding to  xxxg831xxx -antiplasmin.
recent advances in pharmaceutical drug development
led to the discovery of  xxxd2767xxx  ( xxxd2767xxx ), a recombinant product of only the catalytic domain of human plasmin [44]. distinct advantages of  xxxd2767xxx  over plasmin
include. (1) it is approximately one-fourth the size of plasmin
(22-kda versus 88-kda) which is thought to facilitate greater
penetration of vitreous and epiretinal tissues; (2) generation
by recombinant techniques ensures product sterility and
eliminates the risk of microbial contamination associated
with blood derivatives; (3) when commercially available, it
will allow investigators to avoid the rigorous preparation of
autologous plasmin; (4) it is more stable than plasmin which
simplifies storage and timing of administration [45].
intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  has been evaluated in several
preclinical studies utilizing porcine, rat, rabbit, feline, and
human cadaver eyes as the experimental model [46–48].
gandorfer et al. initially reported a dose- and time-dependent cleavage between the posterior hyaloid and the ilm
created by  xxxd2767xxx  without any adverse eﬀects on retinal
structure, in both human cadaver and feline eyes. doses
greater than or equal to 125.0 mug (equivalent to 2 units of
plasmin (sigma-aldrich, poole, united kingdom)) produced
a complete pvd with bare ilm in the human eyes, as
demonstrated by electron microscopy.
de smet et al. [49] confirmed these findings in a porcine
eye model, observing that  xxxd2767xxx  caused vitreolysis

journal of biomedicine and biotechnology
and pvd in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. the
minimal eﬀective dose also appeared to be 125 mug [49].
sakuma et al. [50] corroborated these findings as well in
rabbit eyes using doses of  xxxd2767xxx  ranging from 12.5
to 250 mug. they, too, found that 125 mug of  xxxd2767xxx  or
greater successfully induced a complete pvd, while lower
doses only induced a partial pvd. in all treated eyes, there
was a temporary reduction in the a- and b-wave amplitudes
on electroretinography, which recovered by 14 days after
injection all groups except the 250 mug treatment group. in this
higher dose faction, while the b-wave eventually recovered,
a-wave alterations persisted at 90 days. a mild, transient
vitreous haze was also noted within the first day after
injection in this and other studies [12, 50, 51].
most recently, chen et al. [12] were able to show
through immunofluorescence histochemistry that intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  degraded fibronectin and laminin not
only at the vitreoretinal interface, but also at the level of the
photoreceptor layer in the outer retina of rats. theoretically,
the smaller molecular weight of  xxxd2767xxx  facilitates deeper penetration of retinal tissue but it is uncertain if this holds
true in humans.

3. clinical trials with  xxxd2767xxx 
in 2004, a series of clinical trials sponsored by thrombogenics were initiated and collectively called  xxxd2767xxx  for
intravitreous injection- tractional release without surgical
treatment (mivi-trust). to date, there are 14 studies
involving intravitreal administration of  xxxd2767xxx  (clinicaltrials.gov). of these, 9 are included in the mivi series.
results of the first three clinical trials (mivi-i, mivi-iit, and
mivi-iii) are published [7, 18, 19].
in each of these clinical trials, all patients with prior vitreous surgery and/or history of retinal detachments were
excluded. adverse events were also recorded and none of
these studies have thus far shown an increased rate of retinal
detachment, a known complication of posterior vitreous
detachment, after  xxxd2767xxx  therapy.
3.1. mivi-i: a dose-escalation clinical trial of intravitreal
 xxxd2767xxx  in patients undergoing surgical vitrectomy for
vitreomacular traction maculopathy. mivi-i was a phase
i/ii safety study with dose escalation (25–125 micrograms)
and increasing exposure time (1 hour–1 week) [7]. sixty
patients were enrolled in 6 successive cohorts. all patients
had vitreomacular traction (vmt) maculopathy for which
vitrectomy was indicated, including macular edema associated with vmt, stage ii-iii macular hole of <6 months
duration since symptom onset, demonstration of vitreomacular adhesion (vma) based on preoperative optic coherence
tomography (oct), or an oct finding of posterior hyaloid
membrane inserting onto the macula but with some area of
clear separation visible between the retina and the posterior
hyaloid. results demonstrated that intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx 
was well tolerated and capable of inducing a pharmacologic
pvd in some patients.

3.2. mivi-ii: a randomized, sham-injection-controlled,
double-masked, ascending-dose, dose-range-finding trial
of  xxxd2767xxx  intravitreal injection for nonsurgical pvd
induction for treatment of diabetic macular edema. miviii was a phase ii trial evaluating pvd induction in patients
with diabetic macular edema (dme) 14 days after injection
of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  versus sham. disease status and
safety at 6 months were also evaluated. the study was completed in 2010; however, results have not yet been published
at the time of this paper.
3.3. mivi-iit: a randomized, sham-injection-controlled,
double-masked, ascending-dose, dose-range-finding trial of
 xxxd2767xxx  intravitreal injection for nonsurgical pvd
induction for treatment of vitreomacular traction. miviiit was a randomized, double-masked phase ii trial with a
control sham injection [18]. sixty patients were enrolled in
4 cohorts. patients in each of the cohorts were randomized
to active treatment or sham injection. in the first 3 cohorts,
increasing doses of  xxxd2767xxx  (75, 125, and 175 micrograms) were administered. in the fourth cohort, patients
received 125 micrograms of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  monthly
until the vma was released, up to a total of 3 doses.
the first 3 cohorts had a nonsurgical resolution of vma
in 8, 25, 44, and 27% of the patients who received sham, 75,
125, and 175 micrograms of  xxxd2767xxx , respectively. in the
fourth cohort,  xxxd2767xxx  caused a pvd in 58% of patients
at one month after the last treatment.
the mivi-iit trial provides support for the potential use
of  xxxd2767xxx  in the nonsurgical treatment of vma.
3.4. mivi-iii: a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, parallel-group, dose-ranging clinical trial of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  in patients undergoing
surgical vitrectomy the mivi iii ( xxxd2767xxx  for vitreous
injection iii) trial. mivi–iii evaluated the safety and eﬃcacy of a preoperative intravitreal injection of  xxxd2767xxx 
in patients already scheduled for vitreous surgery [19]. one
hundred twenty-five patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy (ppv) for the treatment of either vmt or macular hole
were enrolled in this phase ii placebo-controlled doublemasked dose-ranging clinical trial. a single intravitreal
injection of  xxxd2767xxx  (25, 75, or 125 micrograms) or
placebo was administered 7 days prior to ppv. the presence
or absence of pvd at baseline, injection day, operative day,
and postinjection day 90 and 180 were evaluated.
rates of pvd observed at the time of surgery were 10,
14, 18, and 31% in the placebo, 25-, 75-, and 125-microgram
 xxxd2767xxx  groups, respectively. the rates of resolution of
vmt precluding the need for ppv at day 35 were 3, 10,
15, and 31% for the placebo, 25-, 75-, and 125-microgram
 xxxd2767xxx  groups, respectively. at day 180, these rates were
3%, 7%, 15%, and 28%. at both day 35 and day 180, the rates
of canceled vitrectomy in the 125-microgram  xxxd2767xxx 
group were statistically significant when compared to the
placebo group (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, resp.).
mivi-iii concluded that  xxxd2767xxx  injection at a dose
of 125 micrograms led to a greater likelihood of induction

4
and progression of pvd than placebo injection. this study
also suggested that patients receiving  xxxd2767xxx  were more
likely to not require vitrectomy surgery and that further trials
were warranted.
3.5. mivi-5: a randomized, sham-injection-controlled, double-masked, multicenter trial of  xxxd2767xxx  intravitreal
injection for treatment of focal vitreomacular adhesion in
subjects with exudative age-related macular degeneration
(amd). exudative amd is a serious cause of blindness
in elderly patients, and current standard of care includes
monthly intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor
(vegf) injections [52]. vitreomacular traction is thought
to exacerbate amd by exerting tractional forces on the
macula, hypothetically stimulating abnormal blood vessel
growth.
mivi-5 is an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety
and eﬃcacy of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  in patients diagnosed
with exudative amd with focal vma. patients enrolled in
this study have active subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane and have received at least 3 antiangiogenic intravitreal
injections, with evidence of focal vma on oct. patients
who have previously received more than 9 antiangiogenic
intravitreal injections are excluded.
the primary outcome measure is the proportion of
patients with release of focal vma by day 28 as determined
by a masked central reading center. mivi-5 started in early
2010 and completion is anticipated in late 2012.
3.6. mivi-trust (tg-mv-006): a randomized, placebocontrolled, double-masked, multicenter trial of  xxxd2767xxx 
intravitreal injection for nonsurgical treatment of focal
vitreomacular adhesion and mivi-trust (tg-mv-007): a
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicenter trial of  xxxd2767xxx  intravitreal injection for nonsurgical
treatment of focal vitreomacular adhesion. mivi-trust
tg-mv-006 and tg-mv-007 are both phase iii clinical trials
evaluating the safety and eﬃcacy of a 125-microgram dose
of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  in patients with focal vma. the
primary outcome measure was the nonsurgical resolution of
focal vma at postinjection day 28. both studies began late
2008 and were completed in 2010. final published results
from these 2 studies are not yet available.
3.7. mivi-8: an open-label, single-centre trial of  xxxd2767xxx  intravitreal injection for nonsurgical treatment of focal
vitreomacular adhesion. mivi-8 is a phase ii clinical trial
assessing the safety and eﬃcacy of 125-microgram  xxxd2767xxx  administered as an intravitreal injection in patients
with focal vma. primary outcome measures include full
ophthalmologic examination at baseline, postinjection days
7, 14, 28, and months 3 and 6. a secondary outcome is the
proportion of patients with nonsurgical resolution of focal
vma at study visits other than the 28-day postinjection visit.
mivi-8 completed in april 2011 and published results are
currently pending.

3.8. mivi-10: an open-label, ascending-exposure-time,
single-center trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties
of  xxxd2767xxx  (generic name of the molecule  xxxd2767xxx )
intravitreal injection in subjects scheduled for primary pars
plana vitrectomy. the purpose of mivi-10 is to evaluate
the pharmacokinetic properties of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx 
when administered at diﬀerent time points prior to planned
ppv. in this phase ii clinical trial, 38 patients undergoing
primary ppv received an intravitreal injection of 125microgram  xxxd2767xxx  5 minutes to 7 days prior to surgery.
 xxxd2767xxx  activity levels in the vitreous samples were
evaluated. the study completed in early 2011 and final results
have not yet been published.
3.9. non-mivi trials. in addition to the mivi-trust trials,
there are 4 other trials that are currently evaluating the
use of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx (clinicaltrials.gov). a singlecenter, placebo-controlled phase ii clinical trial is actively
enrolling patients to assess the eﬃcacy of a high-dose
(1.875 milligram) intravitreal injection of  xxxd2767xxx  in
the treatment of focal vma in patients with exudative
amd. besides improving amd by eliminating vitreomacular
traction,  xxxd2767xxx  may also aﬀect the pharmacokinetics
and eﬃcacy of  xxxd328xxx  agents. a study in rabbits showed
that bevacizumab (an  xxxd328xxx  agent) in combination with
 xxxd2767xxx  facilitated the penetration of bevacizumab into
the retina [53]. the secondary endpoint of this clinical trial
involving amd and  xxxd2767xxx  is a decrease in subsequently
required  xxxd328xxx  injections.
another study recruiting patients is  xxxd2767xxx  for
treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion including macular hole (oasis), a phase ii clinical trial evaluating the treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion
including macular hole with a single 125-microgram intravitreal injection of  xxxd2767xxx .
additionally, the  xxxd2767xxx  intravitreal administration in participants with uveitic macular edema is an
ongoing phase i/ii trial investigating the safety and potential
eﬃcacy of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  as a possible treatment for
macular edema secondary to uveitis. this study was initiated
in 2010 and is anticipated to conclude in early 2012.
finally, the  xxxd2767xxx  in children (mic) trial is
also recruiting patients to assess the safety and eﬃcacy
of intravitreal  xxxd2767xxx  as an adjunct to conventional
vitrectomy for the treatment of pediatric patients under 16
years of age. the vitreous in children is denser and more
adherent to the retina as compared with that in adults,
and the safety and eﬃcacy profile of  xxxd2767xxx  may diﬀer
in children and adults. this phase ii, placebo-controlled,
double-masked trial will evaluate a 175-microgram dose of
 xxxd2767xxx  in pediatric patients undergoing a standard 2port or 3-port ppv. any child diagnosed with stage 1, 2, 3, or
5 retinopathy of prematurity (rop) at the time of the surgery
is excluded.
in summary, the safety and eﬃcacy of  xxxd2767xxx  for
vitreoretinal diseases are being systematically evaluated in
over a dozen clinical trials. the medicine is meant to help
some patients avoid surgery or at least make vitreous surgery
safer in others.

4. federal drug administration approval
in december 2011, a federal drug administration (fda)
application was submitted for the use of  xxxd2767xxx 
2.5 mg/ml in adults. it was withdrawn and resubmitted
for priority review in april 2012. if fda approved, future
applications for  xxxd2767xxx  would include its use in more
common vitreomacular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy
and vein occlusions.
