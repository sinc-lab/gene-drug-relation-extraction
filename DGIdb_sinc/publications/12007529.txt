abstract
orlistat is a non-centrally acting anti-obesity agent that acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit lipase, an enzyme that is crucial
for the digestion of long-chain triglycerides. at the recommended dose of 120 mg three times daily, orlistat inhibits dietary fat absorption by
about 30%. over a 1-year period, obese patients taking orlistat in combination with a hypocaloric diet show a reduction of 2 – 5 kg over the
weight decrease with placebo. when continued for a second year in combination with a weight maintenance diet, orlistat reduces weight
regain compared to placebo-treated patients. orlistat in combination with dietary intervention is also associated with beneficial effects on
cardiovascular risk factors including total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure and plasma glucose. it is not known if
orlistat has any impact on clinical outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death. orlistat has not been compared with
other anti-obesity agents. d 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. background
orlistat (xenicalr, hoffman-la roche) is a novel noncentrally acting anti-obesity agent that acts locally in the
gastrointestinal tract to inhibit pancreatic and gastric lipases,
enzymes that play a crucial role in the digestion of long
chain triglycerides. at the recommended therapeutic dose of
120 mg three times a day, orlistat inhibits dietary fat
absorption by about 30%. orlistat is approved for treatment
of obese patients with an initial body mass index z 30 kg/
m2 or those with a body mass index z 28 kg/m2 in the
presence of other risk factors such as hypertension, type 2
diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and in some cases of obstructive
sleep apnoea.

clinical excellence guidelines published in june 2001
(national institute for clinical excellence, 2001) give the
following recommendations for the use of orlistat.
. orlistat should only be prescribed for obese patients
(who fulfil the licensing criteria) who have lost at least 2.5
kg in weight by dietary control and increased physical
activity alone, in the month prior to treatment.
. when treatment is offered, arrangements should be
made for appropriate health professionals (trained practice
nurses and community dieticians) to offer specific concomitant advice, support and counselling on diet, physical
activity and behavioural strategies.
. continuation of orlistat therapy beyond 3 months
should be supported by evidence of a loss of at least a
further 5% of body weight from the start of treatment.
. continuation of treatment beyond 6 months should be
supported by evidence of a cumulative weight loss of at
least 10% of body weight from the start of drug treatment.
. treatment should not usually be continued beyond 12
months and never beyond 24 months.
the national institute for clinical excellence guidelines
are more restrictive than the guidelines for use that have
been approved by the federal drug administration in the
united states. for instance, there is no requirement for prior
weight loss using a hypocaloric diet and exercise alone. in

addition, continuation of treatment beyond 3 and 6 months
does not require weight loss of at least 5% and 10%,
respectively.

2. clinical pharmacology
2.1. mode of action
orlistat is a chemically synthesised hydrogenated derivative of  xxxd2792xxx , a naturally occurring lipase inhibitor
produced by streptomyces toxytricini (guerciolini, 1997).
orlistat exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the
gastrointestinal tract by forming a covalent bond with the
active serine residue site of gastric and  xxxg1789xxx .
the inactivated enzymes are unable to hydrolyse dietary fat
in the form of triglycerides to absorbable free  xxxd2154xxx  and
monoglycerides. as undigested triglycerides are not absorbed, the resulting caloric deficit may have a positive
effect on weight control. orlistat is highly specific for lipase
and has no significant inhibitory effect on other digestive
enzymes such as amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin and phospholipases.
2.2. pharmacokinetics
systemic exposure to orlistat is minimal. approximately
1% of orlistat is systemically absorbed, with single-dose
studies showing plasma concentrations of intact orlistat < 5
ng/ml after a single dose of 800 mg. in clinical studies
involving monitoring of plasma samples, detection of
intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations
were low with no evidence of accumulation (sjöström
et al., 1998). at therapeutic doses, orlistat is therefore
unlikely to produce systemic lipase inhibition. a few cases
of hypersensitivity (rash, urticaria and angiooedema) have
been reported with orlistat treatment. however, with this
exception, side-effects of orlistat do not appear to be
related to systemic exposure to the drug or any components of the capsule.
after oral dosing, nearly all of the administered drug is
excreted in the faeces, mostly as intact orlistat. based on
animal data, it is likely that the metabolism of orlistat occurs
mainly within the gastrointestinal wall. two metabolites
have been identified in oral [14c]-orlistat mass balance
studies in obese patients. m1 (four-member lactone ring
hydrolysed) and m3 (m1 with n-formyl leucine moiety
cleaved), accounted for approximately 42% of the total
plasma concentration. m1 and m3 have extremely weak
lipase inhibitory activity (1000- and 2500-fold less than
orlistat, respectively) and are considered pharmacologically
inactive (zhi et al., 1996, zhi et al., 1999). the cumulative
renal excretion of orlistat was less than 2%. orlistat and its
metabolites also undergo biliary excretion. complete excretion (faecal plus urinary) of radiolabelled orlistat took 3 to 5
days.

2.3. pharmacodynamics
based on faecal fat measurements, the effect of orlistat
120 mg three times daily is seen after 2 days of treatment.
on discontinuation of treatment, faecal fat usually returns to
baseline, within 48 – 72 h. the inhibition of dietary fat
absorption by orlistat is dose dependent. there is little
additional effect on faecal fat excretion at doses greater
than 360 mg daily and the recommended dose is one 120
mg capsule three times daily.

3. orlistat in clinical practice
3.1. recommendations for use
in adults, the recommended dose of orlistat is one 120
mg capsule with each main meal. the capsules may be
taken immediately before, during or up to 1 h after the meal.
the patient should be on a well-balanced, mildly hypocaloric diet that contains approximately 30% of calories
from fat. the daily intake of fat, carbohydrate and protein
should be distributed as evenly as possible over three main
meals. gastrointestinal side-effects may increase when orlistat is consumed with a meal high in fat content ( > 30%
total daily calories from fat). the effect of orlistat on weight
loss is diminished in patients consuming less than 30% of
calories from fat. no dose adjustment is necessary for the
geriatric patient. the safety and efficacy of orlistat has not
been established in children. at least one ongoing study is
attempting to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
of orlistat in severely obese children and adolescents with
obesity-related comorbid conditions. patients should be
counselled to take a multivitamin that contains fat-soluble
vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition because orlistat has
been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat soluble
vitamins and h-carotene. the supplement should be taken
once a day at least 2 h before or after the administration of
orlistat. many physicians advise their patients to take the
supplement at bedtime.
3.2. weight loss and prevention of weight regain
the effects of orlistat on weight loss, weight maintenance, and prevention of weight regain and on a number of
related comorbid conditions were assessed in eight longterm (1- to 2-year duration) multicenter, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trials (james et al., 1997; hollander et al., 1998; sjöström et al., 1998; davidson et al.,
1999; hill et al., 1999; finer et al., 2000; rossner et al.,
2000; karhunen et al., 2000). similar inclusion criteria were
used in these studies. obese (body-mass index range 28– 47
kg/m2) men and women, aged 18 – 77 years, were eligible
for inclusion. obese patients were randomised to placebo or
orlistat (120 mg three times daily), combined with a
hypocaloric diet (energy deficit of 500 – 600 kcal/day) dur-

patients were treated with orlistat (120 g three times daily) or placebo in combination with a mildly hypocaloric diet.

ing the first year and in three of the trials a weight
maintenance diet in the second year of treatment to prevent
weight regain. the percentages of patients achieving z 5%
and z 10% weight loss after 1 year for the intent-to-treat
populations are summarised in table 1.
3.2.1. studies of orlistat in specialist obesity clinics
sjöström et al. (1998) studied the efficacy of orlistat in
promoting weight loss and preventing weight regain in
obese patients over a 2-year period. after completing a 4week, single blind, placebo lead-in period, 683 patients (567
women) were randomised to receive either orlistat 120 mg
three times daily (n = 343) or placebo (n = 340) in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet (600 kcal/day less than calculated total energy expenditure) containing 30% of the energy
as fat. at randomisation, the study groups were similar with
mean baseline body mass index of 36.0 kg and body weight
of 99.8 and 99.1 kg in the placebo and orlistat groups,
respectively. to compensate for the anticipated reduction in

energy expenditure accompanying the weight loss, the
prescribed energy intake was further reduced by about 300
kcal/day at the end of week 24. for subjects already
prescribed the minimum daily energy intake of 1200 kcal/
day, daily consumption was only reduced to 1000 kcal/day.
in the second 52-week double-blind period, 526 patients
were reassigned orlistat or placebo with a weight maintenance (eucaloric) diet which was designed to prevent or
diminish weight regain rather than to produce further weight
loss. at the end of the first year, the mean decrease in body
weight was 10.3 kg in the orlistat group compared with 6.1
kg in the placebo group (fig. 1). at the end of year 1,
significantly more patients in the orlistat group achieved
clinically relevant weight loss ( z 5%, table 1). during the
second year, patients who continued on orlistat regained
about 2 kg, while those switched to placebo had regained
about 4.6 kg ( p < 0.001). patients switched from placebo to
orlistat lost an additional 0.9 kg during year 2 in contrast to
a mean regain of 2.5 kg in those continued on placebo

( p < 0.001). at the end of 2 years, 57.1% of orlistat patients
vs. 37.4% who took placebo during both years maintained
z 5% weight loss. it is not known if a continuous hypocaloric diet during the second year would have prevented
some of the weight regain.
in a 2-year double-blind multicentre trial, 892 obese
patients (30 – 43 kg/m2) were randomised to receive placebo
(n = 224) or orlistat 120 mg three times daily (n = 668) plus a
hypocaloric diet (davidson et al., 1999). at the end of the
first year, patients were placed on a weight maintenance diet
to assess the impact of treatment on the prevention of weight
regain. in the second year those patients originally randomised to orlistat were re-randomised either to the initial dose
(three times daily) of 120 mg, to a 60-mg dose, or to
placebo. at the end of the first year, orlistat-treated patients
lost significantly ( p < 0.001) more weight (8.7 f 0.37 kg)
than those in the placebo group (5.8 f 0.67 kg). more
orlistat-treated patients achieved clinically significant
weight loss (>5% of their initial body weight) compared
with the placebo-treated subjects (table 1). of the subjects
treated with orlistat 120 mg three times daily during the first
year, those who also received 120 mg during the second
year regained significantly less of their first-year weight loss
(3.2 kg, 35.2% regain) than those who received orlistat 60
mg (4.3 kg, 51.3% regain) or placebo (5.6 kg, 63.4% regain)
during the second year ( p < 0.001). treatment with orlistat
120 mg for 2 years produced significantly more ( p = 0.02)
weight loss (7.6% of initial body weight) compared with
patients who received placebo for 2 years (4.5%). in this
study, the investigators also measured waist circumference,
which is the best anthropometric correlate of the amount of
visceral adipose tissue or intra-abdominal fat (pouliot et al.,
1994). preferential accumulation of abdominal adipose
tissue, especially of visceral adipose tissue, is an independent risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and
coronary heart disease (kissebah et al., 1989). after 2 years
of treatment, the decrease in mean waist circumference was
significantly ( p < 0.05) greater in the orlistat-treated group
( 4.5 cm) compared with the placebo group ( 2.4 cm).
the selection and exclusion criteria in these two studies
(sjöström et al., 1998; davidson et al., 1999), which are the
largest of several similar placebo-controlled studies, may
limit extrapolation to the general population of obese
patients. subjects were excluded if they had cardiac, renal,
hepatic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, or endocrine disorders
or drug-treated diabetes mellitus.
3.2.2. orlistat in primary care
hauptman et al. (2000) evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of orlistat in a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled, study conducted over 2 years in seventeen
primary care centres in the united states. this study differed
from others in that patients were counselled by health care
staff who had no specialist training in diet or obesity
management. patients viewed videos on behaviour modification for weight loss and were provided with booklets on

weight management and dieting. a total of 796 obese
patients (body mass index, 30 –43 kg/m2) were randomised
to receive placebo, orlistat 60 mg three times daily or orlistat
120 mg three times daily in conjunction with a reducedenergy diet for the first year and a weight-maintenance diet
during the second year. patients in each of the orlistat
groups lost significantly more weight (7.1 and 7.9 kg for
the 60 and 120 mg orlistat groups, respectively) than those
treated with placebo (4.1 kg) in year 1 ( p < 0.001) and
sustained more of this weight loss during year 2 ( p < 0.001).
more patients treated with orlistat lost 5% or more of their
initial weight in year 1 compared with placebo (table 1) and
this weight loss was sustained over 2 years in significantly
more ( p < 0.001) of the orlistat-treated patients (34%)
compared with 24% in the placebo group ( p < 0.001). mean
weight loss in this study, in both the orlistat and placebo
groups, was slightly less than that achieved in other trials of
orlistat.
3.2.3. orlistat in patients with type 2 diabetes
caloric restriction and modest weight loss (5– 10% of
initial body weight) improves glycaemic control and insulin
sensitivity in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and is an
important goal of therapy (wing et al., 1987a; meigs et al.,
1997). however, weight loss can be difficult to achieve and
sustain with dietary restriction and exercise alone in this
group of patients (hanefield et al., 1991; wing et al.,
1987a). hollander et al. (1998) studied the efficacy of
orlistat in promoting weight loss in 322 obese patients
(49% female, body mass index 28 – 40 kg/m2) with type 2
diabetes who were taking oral sulphonylurea drugs. patients
were randomised to orlistat 120 mg three times daily or
placebo in combination with a hypocaloric diet (500 kcal/
day deficit) for 1 year. orlistat-treated patients lost significantly ( p < 0.001) more weight (6.2% of initial body
weight) than the placebo group (4.3%). twice as many
patients receiving orlistat lost z 5% of their initial body
weight (table 1). similarly, more patients in the orlistat
group than in the placebo group lost z 10% of their initial
body weight. furthermore, mean waist circumference
decreased significantly more ( p < 0.01) in the orlistat-treated group (4.8 cm) than in the placebo group (2.0 cm).
3.2.4. summary
in summary, orlistat in combination with a hypocaloric
diet has been shown to be efficacious in promoting weight
loss over a 1-year period. in absolute terms, mean weight
loss from trials shows a reduction of some 2 to 5 kg over
the weight decrease with placebo. the percentage of
subjects who lost more than 5% of their initial body
weight ranged from 18.3% to 49.2% in the placebo groups
and 35.5% to 68.5% in those treated with orlistat; greater
than 10% weight loss occurred in 8.8% to 24.8% and
17.9% to 38.9% of these groups, respectively (table 1).
when continued for a second year in combination with a
weight maintenance diet, orlistat reduces weight regain

a. ballinger, s.r. peikin / european journal of pharmacology 440 (2002) 109–117

compared to placebo-treated patients. there is no evidence
about the efficacy of orlistat in promoting weight loss for
periods over 12 months since all studies discontinued
hypocaloric diets at 12 months.
3.3. metabolic complications of obesity
weight reduction in orlistat-treated patients is associated
with beneficial changes in several cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, glucose
intolerance and type 2 diabetes. in clinical studies, the
difference in serum cholesterol levels between placebo and
orlistat-treated subjects was greater than would be expected
from weight loss alone. the independent-cholesterol lowering effect of orlistat is thought to be related to the partial
inhibition by orlistat of fat absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. the decrease in fasting glucose and insulin
concentrations in orlistat-treated patients appeared to be
related to the overall greater weight loss in these patients
rather than an independent drug effect.
3.3.1. dyslipidaemia
in the 2-year study by sjöström et al. (1998), patients
treated with orlistat achieved significantly greater reductions
in serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than those who received placebo.
during a 4-week placebo lead-in period, weight loss was
accompanied by significant decreases in total cholesterol
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol within the future
placebo and orlistat groups. however, after randomisation,
total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol continued to
decline in the orlistat-treated subjects but increased in the
placebo group even though the subjects were losing weight.
after 1 year of treatment, there was a 0.36% reduction in
total cholesterol and 1.15% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in orlistat-treated patients compared
with a 4.91% and 5.18% increase in the placebo-treated
patients ( p < 0.001). the group that received orlistat for 2
years showed a reduction in total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ( 1.14% and
0.62%,
respectively compared to before treatment values). this
was in contrast to those who received placebo for 2 years
in whom these values increased ( + 6.51% and + 6.05%).
changes in triglyceride were similar in both groups throughout the study. a lipid-lowering effect of orlistat (fig. 2) was
also reported by davidson et al. (1999), and in obese
patients with type 2 diabetes (hollander et al., 1998).
3.3.2. insulin and glucose metabolism
in studies of non-diabetic obese subjects, orlistat in
combination with diet resulted in significantly greater
improvements in fasting serum insulin and blood glucose
concentrations than treatment by dietary intervention alone.
at 1 year, there was a significantly greater decrease in blood
glucose in patients receiving orlistat ( 0.21 mmol/l) compared with those receiving placebo ( 0.07 mmol/l). at the

113

end of the second year of the study, blood glucose was just
below ( 0.02 mmol/l) pre-treatment values in those who
received orlistat for 2 years and had increased above pretreatment values ( + 0.25 mmol/l) in those who received
placebo for 2 years (sjöström et al., 1998). in addition, at
the end of 2 years, fasting serum insulin concentrations were
lower ( 5.05% compared to pre-treatment values) in orlistat-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo
( + 19.1%). in the study by davidson et al. (1999), orlistat in
combination with diet also resulted in significantly greater
improvements in levels of fasting serum insulin and glucose
after 1 and 2 years than treatment by dietary intervention
alone.
heymsfield et al. (2000) pooled data from three similar
orlistat trials (davidson et al., 1999; sjöström et al., 1998;
hauptman et al., 2000) to determine whether small amounts
of weight loss improved glucose tolerance and reduced the
rate of diabetes onset in obese patients. this meta-analysis
included only those patients who were assigned to receive
either orlistat 120 mg three times daily or placebo for the
full 2 years. after 2 years, patients taking orlistat lost
significantly more weight (6.7 kg; p < 0.001) than patients
taking placebo (3.79 kg). impaired glucose tolerance at
baseline was present in 18.7% and 16.8% of subjects in
the orlistat and placebo groups, respectively. after 2 years, a
smaller percentage of these patients progressed to diabetes
in the orlistat (3.0%) vs. placebo (7.6%, p = 0.04) group.
furthermore, of the patients with impaired glucose tolerance
at baseline, 71.6% who were treated with orlistat had normal
glucose tolerance at the end of treatment compared with
49.1% in the placebo group ( p = 0.04). fasting serum
glucose concentrations decreased more in patients taking
orlistat than in those taking placebo whether they had
normal ( 0.16 vs.
0.04 mmol/l; p = 0.02) or impaired
glucose tolerance ( 0.42 vs. + 0.1 mmol/l; p = 0.01) at
baseline. there was a trend towards reduced fasting insulin
concentrations in the orlistat-treated group but this was not
significantly different from placebo.
modest weight loss of 5 – 10% improves glycaemic
control in patients with type 2 diabetes (wing et al.,
1987b). in the study by hollander et al. (1998), obese
patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with orlistat in
combination with a mildly hypocaloric diet. at 1 year, there
was a significant improvement in glycaemic control in the
orlistat-treated group as reflected in decreases in haemoglobin a1c, fasting blood glucose and in dosage reductions in
oral sulphonylurea medication. mean fasting insulin concentrations decreased in orlistat-treated patients and
increased in the placebo group. however, this difference
was not statistically significant (table 2).
3.3.3. blood pressure
moderate weight loss of just 5 kg is associated with a
significant reduction in blood pressure in obese patients
with or without hypertension (langford et al., 1991; whelton et al., 1998). in the study by sjöström et al. (1998),

114

a. ballinger, s.r. peikin / european journal of pharmacology 440 (2002) 109–117

with orlistat compared with a 5.5-mm hg reduction in the
placebo-treated group (zavoral, 1998).
3.3.4. summary
orlistat in combination with dietary intervention is associated with beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors.
in clinical trials of obese patients total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein/
high-density lipoprotein ratio, and concentrations of glucose
and insulin decreased more in orlistat-treated than in placebo-treated patients. these changes were also apparent in
obese patients with type 2 diabetes. however, it is not
known if these modest changes in physiologic risk factors
translate into meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes
such as myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death.
3.4. adverse effects

fig. 2. mean ( f s.e.m.) changes in fasting serum low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations in obese patients during
treatment with orlistat or placebo in combination with a hypocaloric diet

systolic and diastolic blood pressure were slightly, yet
significantly, decreased in the orlistat group compared with
placebo-treated patients (mean systolic 129.0 to 127.0 vs.
128.0 to 129.0 mm hg, respectively after 1 year; p = 0.02;
diastolic 82.4 to 80.3 vs. 81.9 to 82.1 mm hg, p = 0.002).
the greater reductions in blood pressure in the orlistattreated group are consistent with the greater degree of
weight loss in the orlistat-treated patients. at the end of
the second year and with introduction of a weight maintenance diet, blood pressure was similar in orlistat and
placebo-treated patients and had increased slightly from
baseline. davidson et al. (1999) also reported significantly
greater reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure after 1 year of orlistat compared with placebo. a
meta-analysis of five randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies showed that patients who had raised
diastolic blood pressure at baseline ( z 90 mm hg) showed
a 7.9-mm hg reduction in diastolic pressure when treated

the safety of orlistat has not yet been established beyond
2 years. orlistat is not appreciably absorbed and systemic
adverse events are negligible. orlistat is associated with a
greater incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects that relate to
its pharmacological mode of action. the majority of patients
treated with orlistat experienced 1 or 2 adverse gastrointestinal events, which usually occurred early in treatment
(within 3 months), were mild to moderate in intensity, and
generally resolved spontaneously (table 3). gastrointestinal
side-effects may increase when orlistat is taken with a diet
high in fat (>30% total daily calories from fat) or if the
recommended daily fat intake is not distributed over three
meals. in placebo-controlled trials, between 1.1% and 6% of
orlistat-treated patients and 0.6% and 1.3% of placebotreated patients withdrew because of gastrointestinal sideeffects (james et al., 1997; hollander et al., 1998; sjöström
et al., 1998; davidson et al., 1999; finer et al., 2000; rossner
et al., 2000).
in clinical trials, treatment with orlistat was associated
with a reduction in mean blood pressure. however, there are
occasional case reports of orlistat associated with increased
blood pressure. in one patient, rechallenge with orlistat
confirmed a temporal relationship between drug treatment
and an increase in blood pressure (persson et al., 2000,
2001).
vagal cholinergic and cholecystokinin mediated hormonal mechanisms are the most important mediators of

gallbladder emptying under physiological conditions. the
release of cholecystokinin from the small intestine is
critically dependent on the presence of long-chain free
 xxxd2154xxx  in the intestine. postprandial cholecystokinin
release and gallbladder contraction might therefore be
decreased by orlistat, potentially resulting in an increased
risk of gallstone formation. in healthy volunteers, orlistat
in combination with a fat meal is reported to reduce
(schwizer et al., 1997; borovicka et al., 2000; feinle et
al., 2001) or have no effect (froehlich et al., 1996) on
postprandial cholecystokinin release. in the latter study,
gallbladder contraction was also measured and the investigators reported that a single dose of orlistat did not
reduce gallbladder motility after ingestion of a pure-fat or
mixed meal. in a double-blind controlled trial, 23 obese
patients were randomised to orlistat, 120 mg three times
daily or placebo in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet
(trouillot et al., 2001). at the end of the 4-week treatment period, there were adverse changes in biliary lipid
composition in the placebo (decrease in total bile acid
and phospholipid concentration) but not the orlistat
group. mean changes from the baseline in cholesterol
saturation and gallbladder motility were similar in both
groups. microscopy of bile did not show evidence of
biliary sludge in either group. thus, in summary, shortterm studies in healthy volunteers and obese patients do
not suggest an increased risk of gallstone formation
during treatment with orlistat. however, the safety of
long-term treatment with orlistat with respect to gallstone
formation remains to be determined.
feinle et al. (2001) showed that postprandial plasma
cholecystokinin levels were reduced after orlistat treatment
and this was associated with an increase in hunger and a
decrease in fullness measured by visual analogue scales.
the authors hypothesise that an increase in hunger in
patients taking orlistat could partially offset the benefit of
the drug on weight loss.
during 2-year clinical studies, plasma concentrations of
fat soluble vitamins (a, d, e and beta-carotene) decreased
among subjects taking orlistat but generally remained

within the clinical reference range. in the study by sjöström et al. (1998), 11.9% of patients in the orlistat group
and 5.3% in the placebo group had two or more consecutive low vitamin concentrations recorded in the first year
of treatment. in the study by davidson et al. (1999),
treatment with orlistat was also associated with a slightly
higher incidence of reduced fat soluble vitamin concentration. in this study, vitamin supplementation was required
in 14.1% of subjects treated with orlistat for 2 years
compared with 6.5% of placebo recipients. supplementation with once-daily multivitamins restored serum concentrations to within the normal range and no subjects were
withdrawn due to low values.
some patients may develop increased urinary oxalate
excretion following treatment with orlistat and therapy
should be used cautiously in patients with a history of
hyperoxaluria or calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.
3.5. drug interactions
absorption of fat soluble vitamins may be decreased by
orlistat. in short-term studies, orlistat did not result in any
change in warfarin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.
however, because of a potential decrease in  xxxd3522xxx 
absorption, patients stabilised on warfarin should be closely
monitored for changes in coagulation parameters. orlistat
markedly decreased peak and trough blood cyclosporine
concentrations in a transplant patient (nagele et al., 1999).
no drug interaction studies have been conducted with
orlistat and cyclosporine.
3.6. contraindications
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of
orlistat in pregnancy. teratogenicity studies conducted in
rats and rabbits at doses of up to 23 and 47 times the
human dose showed no evidence of teratogenicity or
embryotoxicity. however, because animal studies are not
always predictive of human response, orlistat is contraindicated during pregnancy. it is not know if orlistat is
secreted in breast milk and therefore orlistat should not be
taken by breastfeeding women. absolute contraindications
to orlistat include chronic malabsorption syndrome or
cholestasis and known hypersensitivity to orlistat or any
of its components.
3.7. summary
orlistat inhibits gastrointestinal lipase and reduces absorption of dietary fat by about one-third. in a series of 1and 2-year randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials,
orlistat in combination with a weight-reducing diet resulted
in significantly greater weight loss than that achieved with
diet alone. weight regain after a period of weight loss is
also reduced by orlistat treatment. orlistat treatment is
associated with an improvement in serum lipid values that

116

a. ballinger, s.r. peikin / european journal of pharmacology 440 (2002) 109–117

is more than can be explained by weight reduction alone.
improvements in glycemic control and blood pressure have
also been noted and result from decreases in body weight
alone.
it is not known how quickly weight is regained on
cessation of orlistat treatment. longer-term studies with
orlistat will also define the potential for maintenance of
weight reduction and the progression to co-morbidities. in
clinical studies, entry criteria included a body mass index of
z 28 kg/m2 and the majority of patients enrolled were
women (>82%). it is argued that high-risk obese patients
should be identified on the basis of both body weight and
waist circumference (després, 2001). men are generally
characterised by the more dangerous, abdominal obesity
(després et al., 2001). further studies are needed to define
the role of orlistat in these high-risk patients.
sibutramine is also available for the treatment of obesity.
in clinical trials, sibutramine in combination with a hypocaloric diet is more effective at promoting and maintaining
weight loss than dietary treatment alone. there are also
associated beneficial effects on plasma concentrations of
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride, but not low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and these changes exceeded those
expected from weight loss alone (james et al., 2000).
orlistat and sibutramine have not been directly compared
in clinical trials.
