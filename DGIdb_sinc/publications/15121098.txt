abstract
the quaternary amine,  xxxd364xxx , is a class iii antiarrhythmic drug used to treat ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. the primary mode
of action for  xxxd364xxx  is thought to be inhibition of voltage-gated k+ channels. while the na,k-atpase has been the pharmacological target
of cardiac glycosides for over a century, recent evidence has shown that  xxxd364xxx  may also inhibit the na pump. our experimental findings
support and extend these previous reports and provide definitive evidence supporting the previous suggestion that  xxxd364xxx  and k compete
for the na pump. we find that  xxxd364xxx  inhibits the na pump in a dose-dependent manner in both na,k-atpase (ic50 4.5 mm) and rb flux
experiments (ic50 3.5 mm). furthermore, we show that  xxxd364xxx  and rb+ competes for an extracellular site by measuring ouabain-sensitive
86
rb flux in intact human red blood cells; that is, there is an apparent increase in km for rb+ in the presence of 5 mm  xxxd364xxx , while vmax
remains unchanged. we also determined that unlike k+,  xxxd364xxx  does not facilitate the hydrolysis of e2-p. however, it stabilizes this
conformation by reducing the ability of k+ to facilitate dephosphorylation. finally, we show that  xxxd364xxx , like k+, reduces [3h]ouabain
binding to the na pump. taken together, these data are consistent with  xxxd364xxx  binding to the extracellular facing cation site within the e2p state of the enzyme. moreover, these findings suggest that  xxxd364xxx  may serve as an effective tool for freezing the pump in an
extracellularly cation-bound phosphorylated intermediate, which will aid in future structural analyses.

introduction
the na+,k+-atpase (na pump) is a 165 kda heterodimeric protein within the plasma membrane responsible for
maintaining ionic homeostasis of both na+ and k+ within
eukaryotic cells. the outward transport of three na+ molecules and the inward movement of two k+ ions per cycle is
coupled to energy derived from the hydrolysis of a single
molecule of atp [1]. the ionic gradients produced by the
na+ pump are important to cell excitability, contractility,

osmotic balance, and establishes the driving force for the
coupled transport of other important solutes (e.g., ca2 +, h+,
glucose) [2,3]. the sodium pump is a member of the p2-type
family of atpases, which also includes other alkali metal
active transporters such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum caatpase, the gastric h,k-atpase, and the neurospora hatpase [4,5]. the sodium pump consists of a catalytically
active a-subunit, which consists of 10 transmembrane
spanning domains [6] and an additional smaller h-subunit.
the h-subunit consists of a single membrane spanning
region with the majority of the protein facing the extracellular space. the sodium pump and the gastric h,k-atpase
are the only members of the p-type atpases that have two
subunits, which in both cases exist in a 1:1 stoichiometry
[4]. while the role that the h-subunit plays in enzyme
catalysis remains to be definitively elucidated, it has been

j.b. helms et al. / blood cells, molecules, and diseases 32 (2004) 394–400

demonstrated to play a role in assembly and delivery of the
ah complex to the plasma membrane [7].
the kinetics of the sodium pump are described in terms of
the post – albers model (fig. 1) [8,9]. in this model, two
major conformations are considered (e1 and e2), which can
exist in either a phosphorylated or unphosphorylated state.
since there is some variability in how e1 and e2 are used in
the literature, we define our usage as follows: e1 and e1-p
are enzyme conformations that have the cation-binding site
facing the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and e2 and
e2-p are enzyme conformations that have the cation-binding
site facing extracellularly. in the forward direction, e1
preferentially binds na that is required to facilitate phosphorylation via atp to produce e1-p. there is then a
conformational change that translocates the three na+ ions
to the extracellular space and results in the e2-p conformation. continuing forward, e2-p preferentially binds k+ from
the extracellular side, which subsequently potentiates the
hydrolysis of e2-p and concomitantly results in the occlusion of k+ ions in the e2 conformation. the second translocation step ensues and releases the two k+ ions to the
cytoplasm that brings the enzyme back to the initial e1 state.
the sodium pump has been the pharmacological target
for the treatment of congestive heart failure by cardiac
glycosides for more than a century. recently, it has also
been suggested that the class iii antiarrhythmia drug  xxxd364xxx  tosylate (brt) may also inhibit the sodium pump [10 –
12]. the primary mode of action for brt has been suggested
to be the inhibition of voltage-dependent k+ channels [13];
however, garfinkel et al [14] demonstrated that the ability of
brt to convert ventricular fibrillation to ventricular tachycardia was unrelated to its ability to inhibit k+ channels.

395

since brt is a quaternary amine that has been used as a k+
channel blocker, we investigated the possibility that brt
might mimic k+ on the sodium pump. indeed, two of us
have previously demonstrated that in the presence of extracellular protons, there was increased binding of brt to the
sodium pump of red blood cells that was similar to the
effects of extracellular protons on k+ binding [15].
in this paper, we demonstrate that (1) brt inhibited
ouabain-sensitive rb+ uptake into intact human erythrocytes
in a manner that was competitive with respect to rb+. these
observations agree with earlier reports measuring rb uptake
into trout  xxxd187xxx  [16]. (2) we observed that brt inhibits
na,k-atpase activity measured in purified dog kidney
enzyme with the same affinity (approximately 4 mm), as
it does the red cell rb+ flux. this inhibitory potency is
slightly less than that reported for membrane preparations
from guinea pig heart [11,16]. (3) unlike k+, brt does not
facilitate dephosphorylation of e-p; in contrast, it appears to
stabilize e-p. in addition, the binding of brt reduces the
ability of k+ to facilitate dephosphorylation. (4) similar to
k+, brt antagonizes [3h]ouabain binding. taken together,
these data are consistent with brt binding to the extracellular cation site in the e2-p conformation of the na pump.

materials and methods
materials
[32p]atp and 86rb were from perkin –elmer life sciences. all other chemicals were reagent grade purchased
either from sigma (st. louis, mo) or from fisher scientific
(pittsburgh, pa). dog kidneys were harvested from euthanized dogs that were part of other approved iacuc experiments and were the kind gift of dr. james l. cook. red
blood cells were obtained from a male human volunteer.
na,k-atpase assay and enzyme phosphorylation with
[32p]atp

fig. 1. a modified post – albers scheme for the sodium pump reaction
cycle. during the normal cycle, na+cyt and mgatp bind to e1, and the e1-p
phosphointermediate is formed. na+ext dissociates, and then k+ext binds to
e2-p. this binding causes immediate dephosphorylation of the enzyme.
after k+cyt dissociates, the cycle can start again. not shown is the
stimulation of k+cyt deocclusion by atp, a low affinity effect. a and b are
inhibitors that bind, respectively, to the cytoplasmic and extracellular
transport sites. pnppase activity is catalyzed by a pump conformation that
has k+ bound. the fact that the pump can mediate k+/k+ exchange in the
absence of atp and pi implies that the bottom pathway that allows the
dephosphorylated pump with the transport site facing extracellularly (e2)
must occur at least at the rate of k+/k+ exchange. inhibitor a will be
competitive with respect to na+cyt; in contrast, inhibitor b will be
competitive with respect to k+ext, but not with respect to na+cyt .

atp hydrolysis was measured as reported previously for
the red cell ca pump [17], with minor modifications for
purified na,k-atpase (see ref. [17]). briefly, a 0.1-mg
quantity of purified canine renal sodium pump enzyme was
diluted into 2.8 ml of 200 mm imidazole (ph 7.4). this
mixture was warmed at 37jc for 10 min before being
diluted 12-fold into 550 al of an assay solution containing
(in mm): 50 imidazole (ph 7.4), 10 mgcl2, 0.5 tris – atp
(0.5 aci [32p]atp), 130 nacl, and 20 kcl. quadruplicate
samples were then incubated for 10 min at 37jc. reactions
were stopped with the addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold
solution containing 12 mm trichloroacetic acid and 100 g/
l activated charcoal. the activated carbon was removed via
centrifugation in a microfuge (4000 rpm, 2 min). a 0.5-ml
volume of each supernatant containing liberated 32po4 was
assayed with liquid scintillation spectroscopy.

e-p measurements
the phosphorylation measurements were carried out
essentially as described previously [18] in 50 al medium
containing 1 mm nacl (or 1 mm kcl), 0.1 mm mgcl2, 50
mm tris –hcl, ph 7.2, and 50 ag of protein. the reaction
was initiated by the addition of atp ([32p]atp, and 7.3 am
tris – atp) and incubated in an ice-bath for 30 s. the
phosphorylation was stopped with 750 al of ‘‘ice-cold’’
5% (v/v) perchloric acid (pca) containing 0.5 mm tris –
atp and 1.5 mm tris-phosphate. the samples were filtered
through millipore filters (pore size 0.45 am), washed three
times with 3 ml of stopping buffer, and counted in a
scintillation counter. specific phosphorylation was calculated from the difference between 32p incorporation in native
protein preparations and those where pca was added before
atp to denature the proteins. for dephosphorylation experiments, see fig. 6.
[3h] ouabain binding
specific ouabain binding was measured as described
earlier [7]. briefly, 50 ag of enzyme was incubated at
37jc for 1 h in 50 ml of an incubation buffer containing
3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1 mm na2vo4, 1 mm egta, 10 mm
mops –tris (ph 7.2) containing 5 mm [3h]ouabain in the
presence or absence of 1.4 mm unlabeled ouabain. the
reaction mixtures were filtered through millipore filters
(pore size 0.45 mm), washed three times with ice-cold
mops – xxxd3449xxx , and the amount of radioactivity was
determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. the difference between samples incubated in the absence and presence of excess ouabain was considered specific ouabain
binding.

rb influx into human erythrocytes

ouabain-sensitive 86rb influx was determined as described previously [15]. for each rb + concentration, we
determined the ouabain-sensitive flux as the difference
between controls and samples containing 1 mm ouabain.

results
fig. 2 shows the concentration-dependence of brt
inhibition of the na pump. the na pump inhibition by
 xxxd364xxx  was measured both on na,k-atpase activity
from purified dog enzyme (fig. 2a) and on 86rb flux
into human  xxxd187xxx  (fig. 2b). the k-congener rb+ was
chosen for these experiments because 86rb+ is a more
convenient radioisotope than 42k+, and the na pump
transports both ions equally. the ic50 values obtained
from both measurements were similar (i.e., 4.5 f 0.21
and 3.5 f 0.24 mm for atpase and rb flux, respectively). moreover, the similarity in ic50 values between

fig. 2. dose-dependence of brt inhibition on atpase and rb+ flux. the
inhibitory effect of brt was measured on both an ‘‘open’’ preparation of na
pump (a) and on whole red blood cells (b). in both cases, lines were fit to
the standard equation v = v * ic50/(ic50 + b) where v is the maximal
velocity in the absence of brt (i.e., b = 0), and b is [brt]. the ic50 was 4.5
f 0.21 and 3.5 f 0.24 mm for atpase activity and rb+ flux
measurements, respectively. the similarity between the two ic50 values
is consistent with brt acting at the same site in each. data were normalized
to the activity in the absence of brt for both a and b.

the sided red cell preparation and the ‘‘open’’ atpase
preparation is consistent with brt acting at the same
extracellular site within the ‘‘open’’ enzyme preparation
as it does when only applied to the outside of the red
cell. that is, it appears brt does not bind to the inward
facing cation site exposed in the e1 conformation (or brt
binds with exactly the same apparent affinity in both e1
and e2-p).
 xxxd364xxx  binding to e2-p predicts that extracellular k +
and brt should compete. we tested this prediction in human
 xxxd187xxx  by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86rb+ uptake. it is
clear in fig. 3 that as the [rb+] increases the inhibition by 5
mm brt decreases. when both curves were fit to the
michaelis– menten equation, the maximal velocities were
not significantly different (i.e., control vmax = 1.01 f
0.014,  xxxd364xxx ; vmax = 0.96 f 0.02), yet the km for
rb+ in the presence of brt was increased, consistent with

fig. 3. brt inhibition of ouabain-sensitive rb+ flux. the rb concentrationdependence for 86rb+ uptake into  xxxd187xxx  was tested in the absence and
presence of 5 mm brt. these experiments clearly show that rb+ and brt
compete for an extracellular site on the na pump. data were fit to the
michaelis – menton equation. circles represent flux in the absence of
inhibitor, triangles represent flux in the presence of brt. consistent with
competition, km changed (0 mm brt, km = 0.21 f 0.01 mm; 5 mm brt,
km = 0.97 f 0.05 mm), but vmax remained the same (0 mm brt, vmax =
1.01 f 0.01; 5 mm brt, vmax = 0.96 f 0.02). data values were normalized
to the vmax in absence of brt.

further support for brt and k+ occupying the same extracellular site (fig. 4).
the data presented above demonstrated that brt and k+
bind to the same enzyme conformation (e.g., e2-p) and
likely to the same site. although it is unlikely, due to its
size, that brt would be transported by the na pump, brt
could conceivably facilitate some of the k+-dependent
partial reactions of the pump. for example, k+ has two
effects on the phosphorylated pump (e-p). intracellular k+
(by competing with na+ and lowering the atp affinity)
prevents phosphoenzyme formation while extracellular k+
in the forward reaction cycle accelerates enzyme dephosphorylation. fig. 5a shows that brt differed from k+ in its
inability to prevent phosphoenzyme formation from na+,
mg2 +, and atp, whereas the presence of k+ completely
abolished the amount of phosphoenzyme formed. even at
concentrations 10-fold higher than the ic50 value, brt had
no effect on the amount of phosphoenzyme formed (fig.
5b). although the experiments performed in fig. 5 were

both rb+ and brt binding in a mutually exclusive manner
to the e2-p state (fig. 3).
in order to test further whether brt binds to e2-p, we
measured [3h]ouabain binding to purified dog enzyme in
the presence and absence of brt. it is known that the
binding of k+ antagonizes ouabain binding to the na,katpase. consequently, if brt binds to e2-p, then it should
decrease the ability of [3h]ouabain to bind. indeed, the
presence of brt significantly decreased the amount of
specific [3h]ouabain associated with the enzyme, providing

using purified canine renal na pump. like k+, brt antagonsizes ouabain
binding in a dose-dependent manner. error bars represent the mean f se

[3h]ouabain binding in the absence of brt.

fig. 5. effect of  xxxd364xxx  on e-p. the ability of  xxxd364xxx  to inhibit na+dependent phosphorylation from atp32 was determined. (a) na+ (1 mm)
facilitated 32pi incorporation, whereas k+ (1 mm) did not. also, the
presence of both na+ and k+ resulted in no measurable phosphorylation,
since k+ ions facilitate hydrolysis. similar to k+,  xxxd364xxx  (5 mm) did not
facilitate 32pi incorporation; however, in contrast to k+,  xxxd364xxx  was
unable to prevent na-dependent phosphorylation, nor facilitate hydrolysis.
(b) in order to determine if a higher concentration of  xxxd364xxx  was needed
to compete with na+ and prevent pump phosphorylation, we measured ep
formation (with na, mgatp) at increasing  xxxd364xxx  (0 – 50 mm). brt
failed to prevent ep formation at any concentration. data are means of
quadruplicate determinations and bars are standard errors from a single
experiment in each case representative of several similar experiments.

competes with k+ for binding at the extracellular cation site.
(2)  xxxd364xxx  does not compete with intracellular na+. (3)
 xxxd364xxx  cannot replace k+ and support atpase nor catalyze dephosphorylation. (4)  xxxd364xxx  can replace k+ and
antagonize the binding of ouabain. below we discuss our
data in context of the post – albers scheme for p-type atpase
function and suggest that  xxxd364xxx  may be a useful tool to
examine the pump in an e2-p/cation-bound state.

 xxxd364xxx  competes with external k+, but not internal
na+

fig. 6.  xxxd364xxx  blocks k+-mediated dephosphorylation. the ability of
brt to prevent k+ from accelerating ep hydrolysis was determined.
phosphoenzyme was formed by the addition of na+, mg2+, and 32p[atp].
after 30 s, the phosphoenzyme solution was diluted into media containing
either (a) na+, (b) k+, or (c) k+ with the indicated concentrations of brt,
and the remaining phosphoenzyme was measured. data are normalized
values for the na-dependent phosphorylation: (c
b)/(a
b). in these
experiments, [k+] was 0.1 mm; data are from three experiments. the line is
the best linear fit to the data. clearly, brt increases the amount of
phosphoenzyme present, that is, it prevents k+ dephosphorylation.

performed at 1 mm na+, maximal ep levels were achieved
as increasing the na+ concentration to 65 mm did not
increase our ep measurements; moreover, the higher [na+]
had no effect on brt (data not shown). we conclude from
these experiments that either (1) brt cannot bind to the
phosphoenzyme or (2) that brt does bind to ep but cannot
induce the conformational change necessary to allow h2o
to attack the acylphosphate within the active site.
the post – albers scheme (fig. 1) shows that the addition of k+ in the forward direction facilitates dephosphorylation of e-p (indeed e2-p is usually defined as k+sensitive ep). thus, we can distinguish between the two
conclusions above by determining the effect of brt on k+mediated dephosphorylation. if brt does bind to the
phosphoenzyme, but cannot induce the requisite conformational change, one would predict that brt would reduce
the ability of k+ to accelerate dephosphorylation by
competing with k+. fig. 6 demonstrates that brt does
indeed slow the rate of k+-mediated dephosphorylation in
a dose-dependent manner. thus, these data strongly support a model where brt binds to the phosphoenzyme in a
mutually exclusive manner with k+ (i.e., the e2-p conformation, fig. 1).

discussion
the work presented here describes an in-depth characterization of  xxxd364xxx  inhibition of the na pump and is
consistent with the following hypotheses: (1)  xxxd364xxx 

the positive charge on  xxxd364xxx  suggested that it might
inhibit the pump by competing with either na+ or k+ (or
both) for binding to the cation site on the enzyme. our data
are accommodated by a model in which  xxxd364xxx  competes
with extracellular k+ on e2-p and is not inhibiting by
binding intracellularly.
increasing concentrations of rb+ were able to overcome
the inhibitory effect of  xxxd364xxx , and the maximal velocity
for 86rb uptake into  xxxd187xxx  was unchanged (fig. 3). in
these flux experiments, rb+ activation necessarily occurs at
the extracellular surface (inhibitor b in fig. 1). furthermore,
when we measured e-p formation from na+ and mgatp in
an open enzyme preparation, brt was unable to block po4
incorporation (fig. 5). specifically, the ic50 for brt is less
than 5 mm, yet 10-fold higher brt concentrations were
unable to prevent e1-p formation (fig. 5b); these observations provide strong evidence that brt cannot bind to the
intracellular cation site (i.e., e1). these data are consistent
with the observations of  xxxd364xxx  inhibition of guinea pig
cardiac na,k-atpase and rb+ influx in trout erythrocytes
[16].
we performed controls for atpase, e-p, and paranitrophenyl phosphatase (pnppase) measurements using tosylate
anion. we found that tosylate did not alter e-p levels nor
na,k-atpase activity (unpublished observations). however, we did observe an inhibitory effect of tosylate on
pnppase activity (unpublished observations). we are currently trying to decipher the different pnppase inhibitory
components produced by brt and tosylate.

 xxxd364xxx  binds to the extracellular cation site
 xxxd364xxx  prevented k+ dephosphorylation of e2-p (fig
6). moreover, a much higher concentration of  xxxd364xxx  was
required for blocking k+ dephosphorylation than for inhibiting the atpase or rb+ flux reactions. at first glance of the
kinetic model in fig. 1, one would predict that the ic50 for
brt inhibiting na,k-atpase and preventing k-dependent
dephosphorylation should be similar for the same [k+].
indeed, the affinity for brt to bind to e2-p is the same
regardless of the experimental measurement. however, the
different experimental methods used for each measurement

j.b. helms et al. / blood cells, molecules, and diseases 32 (2004) 394–400

399

necessitate that more brt be required to prevent k+ dephosphorylation. thus, this result was expected because in
the dephosphorylation reaction, as soon as a k+ binds, the
enzyme is dephosphorylated, and under our conditions,
rephosphorylation is prevented. consequently, there must
be sufficient brt present to prevent the first k+ from
binding to stop dephosphorylation. in contrast, when k+
binds during the atpase, a single atpase cycle occurs, but
then brt can rebind and prevent the subsequent atpase
cycle, resulting in inhibition.
ouabain has been shown to bind preferentially to the
e2-p form of the na pump and has been well documented
to bind extracellularly [4]. in addition, binding of ouabain
has been shown to be antagonized by the presence of
extracellular k+ in a dose-dependent manner. indeed,
measuring the ability of k+ to antagonize [3h]ouabain
binding has been used successfully in the past to determine
if selective inactive, but properly folded, na pump mutants
were involved in k+ coordination [19]. thus, in these
studies, we used ouabain-binding antagonism to determine
if brt, like k+, induced a na pump conformation that
decreased the kd for cardiac glycosides. indeed, brt was
able to antagonize ouabain binding in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 4). consequently, taken together, the above
observations argue convincingly for brt competing with
k+ for the extracellular facing cation site on the phosphoenzyme (e2-p).

our data are consistent with a model in which  xxxd364xxx 
can trap the pump in an e2-p/ xxxd364xxx  conformation. in
previous work from one of our laboratories [15], we
concluded that  xxxd364xxx  behaved more like extracellular
k+ than like extracellular na+. this conclusion was based
upon the fact that extracellular protons increased the apparent affinity for k+ and brt, but had little or no effect on the
binding of na+. thus, it appears that not only does brt
inhibit the sodium pump by preventing k+ from accessing
its extracellular binding site but also that brt traps the pump
in an e2-p/brt conformation. until now, only two pump
phosphointermediate conformations with extracellular transport access have been characterized: e1-pna and e2-p. k+
binding to e2-p leads to immediate dephosphorylation;
thus, it has not been possible to study the phosphointermediate when the transport site is occupied and the pump is
in a k+-bound state (e2-p/cation). since  xxxd364xxx  binds to
this conformation and inhibits the pump,  xxxd364xxx  can be
an important tool in characterizing the na pump. one such
application may be to use brt to stabilize the e2-p
conformation for high-resolution structural analyses. at this
point, there are only two crystal structures of any p-type
pump, that is, the e1-ca and e2-thapsigargin states of
serca [22].  xxxd364xxx  (or like compounds) may aid in
the characterization of an additional pump conformation.

atpase assay using [32p]atp versus a colorimetric assay

conclusion

earlier, we reported that the concentration dependence
of brt was biphasic [12]. that is, low concentrations of
brt produced a small, but consistent, increase in atpase
activity, which was followed by an exponential decrease in
atpase activity as [brt] increased above 2 mm [20].
when we repeated these experiments, we noticed the
formation of a precipitate in the reaction tubes containing
brt when we used the standard atpase assay protocol of
brotherus et al. [21]. subsequent experiments to determine
the concentration dependence of brt utilizing [32p]atp for
na,k-atpase assays instead of the molybdate-based colorimetric assay revealed no such stimulation at low brt
(e.g., see fig. 2a). the formation of a precipitate can
explain both an apparent stimulation via increased light
scattering in the spectrophotometer (as was likely the case
with our earlier results); in addition, a precipitate may lead
to an overestimate of the inhibitory potency if much of the
colored precipitate settles to the bottom of the cuvette
before reading the sample. this may explain the difference
between our brt ic50 value of 4.5 mm measuring 32po4
liberation (fig. 2a) and the 2.3 mm value reported for brt
inhibition of guinea pig cardiac na,k-atpase, where the
molybdate colorimetric assay was used [16]. alternatively,
the different values may reflect species or pump isoform
differences (or both).

we have demonstrated that brt inhibits the na pump by
specifically competing with k+ for the extracellular binding
site. also, we show that brt cannot bind to the intracellular
facing na site, as high brt (50 mm) could not prevent e1-p
formation in the presence of low na (1 mm). how can this
dramatic sided difference for brt be explained? one possibility is that these differences reveal a significant size
distinction between the two opposite facing cation sites (or
access to the sites). that is, since brt is a relatively large
molecule as compared to k+, its ability to compete with k+
on the extracellular side would then suggest that the binding
sites on this surface are more open then the intracellular
binding sites that obviously exclude brt. currently, our
laboratories are investigating this possibility utilizing other
positively charged organic compounds.
