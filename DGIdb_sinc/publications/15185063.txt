abstract using a series of triptans we characterized in
vitro the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptor that
mediates the contraction in guinea-pig iliac arteries
moderately precontracted by prostaglandin f2alpha (pgf2alpha).
additionally, we investigated by reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (rt–pcr) which  xxxd3263xxx -sensitive receptor is present in this tissue. frovatriptan,
 xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx , naratriptan, sumatriptan, and
almotriptan contracted guinea-pig iliac arteries with pd2
values of 7.52±0.04, 6.72±0.03, 6.38±0.06, 6.22±0.05,
5.86±0.05 and 5.26±0.04 respectively. for comparison,
the pd2 values for 5-ht and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5ct) were 7.52±0.02 and 7.55±0.03 respectively. in
contrast to all other triptans tested, the concentrationresponse curve for  xxxd1976xxx  was biphasic (first phase:
0.01–3 mum, pd2≈6.6; second phase: ≥10 mum). contractions to 5-ht, 5-ct, frovatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx ,
naratriptan, sumatriptan, almotriptan, and  xxxd1976xxx  (first
phase) were antagonized by the 5-ht1b/1d receptor
antagonist gr127935 (10 nm) and the  xxxg1109xxx 
antagonist sb216641 (10 nm). rt-pcr studies in guineapig iliac arteries showed a strong signal for the 5-ht1b
receptor while expression of  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors
was not detected in any sample. the present results
demonstrate that  xxxd3263xxx -induced contraction in guinea-pig
iliac arteries is mediated by the  xxxg1109xxx . the
guinea-pig iliac artery may be used as a convenient in vitro
model to study the (cardio)vascular side-effect potential of
anti-migraine drugs of the  xxxd3263xxx  family.

introduction
at the present time there is no clear consensus on the
mechanism of action of sumatriptan and newer  xxxd3263xxx 
derivatives as highly effective drugs in aborting migraine
attacks (humphrey and goadsby 1994; pauwels and john
1999; goadsby 2000; tfelt-hansen et al. 2000; villalón et
al. 2002; waeber and moskowitz 2003). particularly, the
nature of the 5-ht receptor(s) mediating the anti-migraine
effect of the triptans is unclear (goadsby 2000). it is likely
that the therapeutic action of the triptans is based on
vascular effects, neuronal effects or both. triptans
constrict cranial vessels (de vries et al. 1999) via
activation of 5-ht1b receptors (longmore et al. 1997;
nilsson et al. 1999a; van den broek et al. 2002). in
addition, triptans induce peripheral trigeminal neuronal
inhibition (moskowitz and cutrer 1993) via activation of
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors (rebeck et al. 1994) or inhibition of
transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. the latter
effect is mediated by 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  or  xxxg1112xxx  receptors
(goadsby 2000). on the other hand, sumatriptan, as well
as other triptans, also constrict peripheral vessels, including the human coronary artery. the human coronary artery
has been used as an in vitro model to evaluate the side
effect potential of anti-migraine drugs (parsons et. 1998;
maassenvandenbrink et al. 1998, 2000; bou et al. 2001;
van den broek et al. 2002). functional pharmacological in
vitro studies using human coronary arteries have shown
that the  xxxg1109xxx  is the predominant vascular
receptor mediating contractility to 5-ht and  xxxd3263xxx 
agonists (maassenvandenbrink et al. 2000; van den
broek et al. 2002). in rabbit pulmonary artery, however,
not only 5-ht1b but also  xxxg1110xxx  receptors seem to be
involved in 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct)-induced
contraction since the effects were antagonized by both
the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist sb224289 and the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor antagonist brl15572 (murdoch et al. 2003).
there are controversial reports concerning the presence
or absence of mrna for 5-ht1 receptor subtypes in
vascular tissues. while 5-ht1b mrna has been detected
in nearly all vessels responding to triptans,  xxxg1110xxx  mrna

55

seems to be only weakly expressed or completely absent in
vascular tissue of different species including man, pig and
rat (ullmer et al. 1995; bouchelet et al. 1996, 2000;
verheggen et al. 1998; ishida et al. 1999; morecroft et al.
1999; nilsson et al. 1999b). on the other hand, mrnas
encoding both 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors have been
detected in dog saphenous vein (branchek et al. 1995).
concerning  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna in vascular tissue,
information is unclear (bouchelet et al. 1996, 2000; ishida
et al. 1999; nilsson et al. 1999b). controversial results
have also been obtained using immunocytochemical
approaches and in situ hybridization techniques. such
experiments revealed the presence of 5-ht1b receptors or
both 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors in different blood
vessels of man and rabbit (nilsson et al. 1999a, 1999b;
razzaque et al. 2002; akin and gurdal 2002; van den
broek et al. 2002). thus, any a priori assignment of the
vascular 5-ht receptor to the  xxxg1109xxx  subtype is
not quite correct. whether contractile responses to 5-ht or
triptans in the vasculature can be explained by activation
of 5-ht1b receptors,  xxxg1110xxx  and/or possibly  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors remains to be firmly established in the respective
vessel under investigation (watts and cohen 1999).
the present study was undertaken to characterize the
 xxxd3263xxx -sensitive 5-ht1b/1d receptor in the guinea-pig
isolated iliac artery. a further aim was to show, whether
this guinea-pig model represents a reliable functional invitro bioassay for evaluation of the (cardio)vascular sideeffect potential of anti-migraine drugs. we performed
organ bath studies using 5-ht, 5-ct and a series of
triptans (sumatriptan, almotriptan,  xxxd1976xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx ,
naratriptan,  xxxd3562xxx , and frovatriptan) as agonists.
experiments were conducted in the absence and presence
of the non-selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist
gr127935 (skingle et al. 1996), the selective 5-ht1b
receptor antagonist sb216641, and the selective  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor antagonist brl15572 (price et al. 1997;
schlicker et al. 1997). in addition, we used rt-pcr
technology to identify the mrna being expressed with
regard to the  xxxd3263xxx -sensitive receptor present in this
vessel.

materials and methods
guinea-pigs of either sex (300–400 g) were killed by a blow on the
neck and bled. the right and left common iliac arteries were
removed, cleared of adhering connective tissue and kept in modified
krebs-henseleit solution of the following composition (in mm):
nacl 118, kcl 4.7, cacl2 1.25,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, nahco3 25 and
glucose 11.5. the solution was aerated with 95%o2/5% co2.
drugs the following drugs were obtained as gifts: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct; glaxosmithkline, stevenage, uk), almotriptan
acid maleate (almirall prodesfarma, barcelona, spain), cimetidine
(glaxosmithkline, uk), dinoprost trometamine (pgf2alpha; upjohn,
kalamazoo, mi, usa),  xxxd1976xxx  hydrobromide (pfizer, sandwich,
kent, uk), frovatriptan (ucb pharma, braine-l’alleud, belgium),
2’-methyl-4’-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-(1,1’-biphenyl)-4-carboxylic acid [4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl- xxxd2960xxx -1-al)-phenyl] amide
(gr127935; glaxosmithkline, uk), naratriptan hydrochloride
(glaxosmithkline, uk),  xxxd2419xxx  tartrate (janssen, beerse,

belgium),  xxxd3135xxx  benzoate (msd ltd., ballydine, ireland),
 xxxd3263xxx  (glaxosmithkline, uk) and  xxxd3562xxx 
(astrazeneca, cheshire, uk). the following drugs were purchased:
3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)  xxxd2960xxx -1-yl]-1,1-diphenyl-2- xxxd3026xxx  hydrochloride (brl15572; sigma, st. louis, mo, usa), cocaine
hydrochloride (merck, darmstadt, germany), 5-hydroxytryptamine
creatinine sulfate (5-ht; acros organics, geel, belgium), idazoxan
hydrochloride (sigma, usa),  xxxd3050xxx  hydrogen maleate
(sigma, usa),  xxxd3000xxx  (sigma, usa) and n-[3-[3-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]-4-methoxyphenyl]-2’-methyl-4’-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-[1,1’-biphenyl]-carboxamide hydrochloride (sb216641;
tocris, ellisville, mo, usa).
all drugs were dissolved in distilled water to a 10 mmol/l stock
solution with the following exceptions:  xxxd3000xxx  was dissolved in
50% ethanol, almotriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  in 10 mmol/l hcl.
brl15572 hydrochloride was dissolved in warmed distilled water
to a 3 mmol/l stock solution. stock solutions were diluted in distilled
water.
contractile responses two or three tissue rings (1.5–2 mm long)
were cut in each iliac artery. no attempt was made to remove the
endothelium. each ring was horizontally suspended between two lshaped stainless steel hooks (diameter 0.15 mm) and mounted in a
20-ml organ bath filled with modified krebs-henseleit solution. the
bath fluid additionally contained  xxxd2419xxx  (1 mum),  xxxd3000xxx 
(1 mum), idazoxan (1 mum),  xxxd3050xxx  (0.3 mum), cimetidine
(30 mum) and cocaine (30 mum) to block 5-ht2a-, alpha1-,  xxxg831xxx -, h1- and
h2 receptors, and neuronal uptake of 5-ht, respectively. the
solution was kept at 37°c and aerated with 95%o2/5% co2
(ph 7.4). contractions were recorded using an isometric force
transducer (w. fleck, mainz, germany) attached to a tse 4711
transducer coupler and a siemens c 1016 compensograph. resting
tension was adjusted to 5 mn at the beginning of each experiment.
during an initial stabilization period of 100 min the bathing medium
was changed every 30 min. tissue rings were then exposed to a
near-maximally effective concentration of pgf2alpha (30 mum). after
washout, re-adjusting of the tension to 5 mn and re-equilibration for
further 45 min, the rings were moderately precontracted with an
ec10 to ec20 (0.05 to 0.5 mum) of pgf2alpha. the contractile responses
to 5-ht, 5-ct, and triptans were studied by constructing a single
cumulative concentration-response curve (e/[a] curve) in the
absence and presence of antagonist (gr127935, sb216641 or
brl15572). antagonists were incubated for 45–60 min. effects
were expressed as a percentage of the pgf2alpha (30 mum)-induced
contraction in each tissue.
in separate experiments, the role of the endothelium on agonistinduced contraction was evaluated. using the experimental protocol
described above, these experiments were performed with endothelium-denuded tissue rings or with endothelium-intact tissue rings in
the presence of the  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor, ng-nitro-larginine methyl ester (l-name). to remove the endothelial layer, a
stainless steel wire was inserted into the lumen of the tissue ring and
the ring was gently rolled so that the wire scraped the luminal
surface. in experiments with l-name, this drug (200 mum) was
added 15 min before the pgf2alpha (30 mum)-induced contraction. when
the contraction had reached a plateau, carbachol (10 mum) was added
and the tissues were allowed to relax. carbachol-induced relaxation
was totally absent in arteries treated with l-name and amounted to
49±3% (n=5) in endothelium-intact arteries. the latter observation is
consistent with that reported by sahin-erdemli et al. (1991). lname (200 mum) was reincubated 15 min before the precontraction
with the ec10 to ec20 of pgf2alpha. then a single cumulative e/[a]
curve to 5-ht and sumatriptan was constructed in each arterial ring.
rt-pcr right and left common iliac arteries were obtained from
four guinea-pigs as described above. to obtain a positive control for
receptor expression in rt-pcr, the whole brain of two guinea-pigs
was isolated. arteries and brains were frozen in liquid nitrogen. for
rna isolation the tissues were homogenized in trizol reagent
with a tissue-tearor (biospec, bartlesville, ok, usa) and total
rna was extracted as described earlier (chomczynski and sacchi
1987). after the addition of 200 mul chloroform to the homogenate

56
and centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 g at 4°c, rna was
precipitated from the aqueous layer by the addition of 500 mul
isopropanol. the rna was separated by centrifugation, washed
twice with 1 ml ethanol (75% v/v) and resuspended in water (1 mug/
ml). rna (1 mug) together with random hexamers (2 mug) were
denaturated at 70°c and the first strand of cdna was synthesized in
a reaction volume of 25 mul by adding the following reagents: reverse
transcription buffer (7 mm mgcl2; 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.5;
70 mm kcl; 10 mm dtt), 10 mm dntps, and m-mlv reverse
transcriptase (50 u). a control was similarly prepared, except that
the m-mlv reverse transcriptase was omitted. the reaction was
carried out for 60 min at 37°c. three microliters of the cdna thus
synthesized was diluted to a total volume of 50 mul containing the
following components: taq dna polymerase (2.5 u), 250 mum of
each  xxxd1148xxx , dttp,  xxxd1837xxx  and dctp, 3.0 mm mgcl2, pcr buffer
(10 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.5, 50 mm kcl, 0.15% triton x-100), and
20 mum of the following forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers
(tibmolbiol, berlin, germany): 5’-gcc gcc acc atg ggg
aac cct gag gc-3’ and 5’-tga ctc agg ttg tgc act
taa a-3’ for the guinea-pig  xxxg1109xxx  (pauwels et al. 1998);

ttt ccg gaa  xxxd2550xxx ’ for the guinea-pig  xxxg1110xxx  receptor (bhalla

nucleotides 1–22, and 5’-gaa tgc ttt ctt gaa cta ctt-3’,
nucleotides 1054–1074) were designed on the basis of the sequence
of the guinea-pig  xxxg1112xxx  receptor (bhalla et al. 2002). as internal
standard the gene for  xxxg825xxx  ( xxxg1010xxx )
was used of which the sequence was developed from the primary
structure of the protein. based on this sequence the following pair of
degenerated primers was constructed (roth, karlsruhe, germany):
rod-g6pd-s 5’-gg(agct) ga(ct) (ct)t(agct) gc(agct)
aa(ag) aa(ag) aa(ag) at(act) ta(ct) gg(agct) at

(agct) a(ag)(ag) ta(ag) tg(ag) tc-3’. the pcr was
performed in a stratagene robocycler gradient 40 (stratagene
europe, amsterdam, the netherlands) under the following conditions: cdna was denaturated for 60 s at 95°c and annealed to the
primers for 75 s at 59°c with the reaction extended for 100 s at 72°c
and this procedure was repeated for 42 cycles. the amplified pcr
products (fragment size of 1,170 bp, 1,140 bp and 1,050 bp for the
5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors, respectively) were separated
on 1% tae-agarose gel, treated with ethidium bromide for 15 min,
shortly differentiated with water and photographed.
data analysis and presentation data are presented as mean ± sem
for n animals. agonist concentration-response curves (e/[a] curves)
were fitted to the hill equation using an iterative, least-squares
method (graphpad prism 4.0, graphpad software, san diego, ca,
usa):
e¼

emax
1 þ 10ðpec50 log ½ aþnh

to provide estimates of the maximum response emax (relative to the
maximum response induced by 30 µm pgf2alpha) and the halfmaximum effective concentration pd2 (the negative logarithm of the
molar concentration of the agonist producing 50% of the maximum
response). to monitor individual changes both in emax and pd2 to
the reference agonist 5-ht, at least one arterial ring was routinely
used as control.
antagonist affinities were expressed as either an apparent pkb or
a pd’2 value. apparent pkb values were calculated from the
following equation:
pkb ¼  log ½b þ log ðr  1þ
where [b] is the molar concentration of antagonist and r the ratio of
agonist ec50 measured in the presence and absence of antagonist
(furchgott 1972).

for insurmountable antagonists a pd’2 value was calculated as
follows:


pd00 2 ¼  log ½b þ log emax emax  1
where emax is the maximum response to the agonist in the absence
of antagonist and emax* the maximum response to the agonist in the
presence of antagonist (van rossum 1963).
where appropriate, differences between means were determined
by student’s t-test (unpaired for comparison of means between two
independent experiments, paired for comparison of means between
experiment and control) after checking the homogeneity of the
variances by f-test; p values <0.05 were considered to be
significant.

results
5-ht, 5-ct and sumatriptan have previously been shown
to elicit 5-ht1b/1d receptor-mediated contractions in the
guinea-pig isolated iliac artery if the basal tone is slightly
increased by pgf2alpha (sahin-erdemli et al. 1991; schoeffter
and sahin-erdemli 1992). the phenomenon of activating
silent 5-ht receptors, however, does not occur exclusively
with the 5-ht1b/1d receptor (sahin-erdemli et al. 1991;
schoeffter and sahin-erdemli 1992) but also with the 5ht2a receptor in this tissue (pertz 1993). the observation
is consistent with that reported in rabbit ear artery, where
5-ht1b/1d- and  xxxg1113xxx -mediated responses to 5ht have been uncovered by a small k+-induced
precontraction (smith et al. 1999). to eliminate the
influence of contractile 5-ht2a receptors in the present
study, experiments were conducted in the continuous
presence of  xxxd2419xxx  (1 mum).
contractions induced by 5-ht and sumatriptan: role of
endothelium
in preliminary experiments, the endothelium of guinea-pig
iliac artery was mechanically removed. using this treatment, we observed that the magnitude of the contraction to
the exposure to 30 mum pgf2alpha decreased from 12.3
±0.8 mn (n=5) in endothelium-intact rings to 6.1±0.9 mn
(n=5) in endothelium-denuded rings (p<0.05). in addition,
endothelial denudation decreased the efficacy of 5-ht
from 6.0±1.1 to 1.6±0.7 mn (n=5) and that of sumatriptan
from 4.6±0.8 to 1.7±0.7 mn (n=5). decrease in efficacy
following mechanical denudation of the endothelium
might be attributed to functional damage of the vessel.
therefore, endothelium-denuded tissue rings were not
routinely used in the present study. to further evaluate the
role of endothelium on the contractile response to 5ht1b/1d receptor agonists, we used l-name (200 mum) to
inhibit  xxxd2738xxx  synthase in endothelium-intact guineapig iliac arteries. l-name had no significant effect on the
pgf2alpha (30 mum)-induced contraction and did not affect the
efficacy and potency of 5-ht and sumatriptan, respectively (table 1). this suggests that 5-ht1b/1d receptormediated contractions in guinea-pig iliac artery are not
inhibited in the presence of endothelium.

contractions induced by 5-ht, 5-ct and a series of
triptans
in these experiments, endothelium-intact tissue rings of
guinea-pig iliac artery, moderately precontracted by
pgf2alpha, were challenged with 5-ht, 5-ct, and a series
of triptans. 5-ht elicited a contraction with a pd2 value of
7.52±0.02 and an emax value of 32±1% (n=55; fig. 1).
the contraction to 5-ct was similar to that of 5-ht
(pd50=7.55±0.03, emax=29±3%; fig. 1). triptans contracted guinea-pig iliac arteries with the following order of
potency: frovatriptan >  xxxd3562xxx  >  xxxd3135xxx  ≈
naratriptan > sumatriptan > almotriptan (fig. 2). in
contrast to all other triptans tested, the e/[a] curve to
 xxxd1976xxx  was biphasic (fig. 3). only the emax value of
 xxxd3135xxx  was significantly lower than that of 5-ht
( xxxd3135xxx : 22±4%, 5-ht: 43±3% in respective control

10 nm), respectively (figs. 1, 2). gr127935 (10 nm)
inhibited the effects of the agonists in a non-competitive
manner by depression of the maximum response
(pd’2=8.5–8.8). with the exception of one case ( xxxd3135xxx ), the antagonism by sb216641(10 nm) of the
contractile responses to the agonists was more complex
and resulted in both a depression of the maximum
response and in a rightward-shift of the e/[a] curve
(apparent pkb=8.4–9.2; figs. 1, 2, table 3). in experiments with  xxxd3135xxx , sb216641 (10 nm) failed to shift
the e/[a] curve to the agonist to the right and induced only
a moderate depression of the maximum response (fig. 2).

this lower affinity phase was insensitive to both

monitor contamination with genomic dna

rt–pcr
using rt–pcr we analysed mrnas for serotonin
receptor subtypes, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx , expressed
in guinea-pig iliac artery (fig. 4). contamination with
genomic dna could be excluded in all rna preparations
by performing the same rt–pcr procedure without
adding reverse transcriptase. the amplification of  xxxg825xxx  ( xxxg1010xxx ) cdna
(546 bp) ensured the quality of the samples and the level
of transcription. while three different 5-ht mrnas, 5ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx , were found in guinea-pig brain
(control tissue), successful amplification was only detected
in guinea-pig iliac artery using the pair of primers for the
 xxxg1109xxx  (fig. 4). pcr products for the  xxxg1110xxx 
and the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor were not detected in any sample.

discussion
from the historical point of view, 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors have formerly been designated “5-ht1-like

60

receptors” (saxena et al. 1998). sahin-erdemli et al.
(1991) and schoeffter and sahin-erdemli (1992) have
previously reported that the contractile response to 5-ht
in guinea-pig isolated iliac artery is mediated by 5-ht1like receptors (i.e., 5-ht1b/1d receptors). the authors
could show that 5-ht failed to contract iliac arteries unless
a modest degree of tone was induced by a threshold
concentration of pgf2alpha (sahin-erdemli et al. 1991). the
phenomenon that 5-ht1b/1d receptor-mediated contractions to 5-ht or sumatriptan remain ‘silent’ until the
vessels are prestimulated, e.g., with either pgf2alpha,
u46619,  xxxg99xxx , histamine, phenylephrine, noradrenaline or by elevations in extracellular k+ concentration
has also been demonstrated in other vessels such as the
isolated rabbit ear, iliac, mesenteric and renal arteries
(movahedi and purdy 1997; yildiz and tuncer 1995a,
1995b; choppin and o’connor 1993, 1995; hill et al.
2000). the mechanism responsible for this ‘uncovering’ of
5-ht1b/1d receptor-mediated contraction is based on an
influx of external ca2+ through voltage-dependent ca2+
channels with the consequence that the contractile response to 5-ht is facilitated (hill et al. 2000).
previous studies in the authors’ laboratory have shown
that the guinea-pig iliac artery possesses both silent 5ht1-like (i.e., 5-ht1b/1d) and silent 5-ht2a receptors
(pertz 1993). pretreatment with a threshold concentration
of pgf2alpha yielded a biphasic e/[a] curve to 5-ht (pertz
1993). the high affinity phase remained unaffected in the
presence of the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  at
concentrations up to 1 mum while the lower affinity phase
was inhibited by  xxxd2419xxx  (pkb 9.3; pertz 1993). the
observed  xxxd2419xxx  insensitivity versus the high affinity
phase argues against the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor as the subtype
mediating this functional response since  xxxd2419xxx 
showed a pki value of 6.9 for the cloned guinea-pig  xxxg1110xxx  receptor (zgombick et al. 1997). the modest
selectivity (5-fold) of  xxxd2419xxx  for the guinea-pig  xxxg1110xxx  receptor vs. the guinea-pig  xxxg1109xxx  in
radioligand binding studies, however, suggests that
 xxxd2419xxx  has limited utility in discriminating functional
responses mediated by these subtypes (zgombick et al.
1997). in the present study, we used brl15572, a
selective antagonist at human  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (price et
al. 1997), to show whether  xxxg1110xxx  receptors might be
involved in 5-ht-induced contraction in guinea-pig iliac
artery. brl15572 (100 nm) was ineffective in blocking
the contractile responses to 5-ht and sumatriptan,
respectively. to our knowledge, no binding data are
available for brl15572 at guinea-pig 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors. in addition, it should be mentioned that
brl15572 failed to discriminate between porcine 5ht1b and 5-h1d receptors (bhalla et al. 2000). therefore,
we used other methods including rt-pcr to provide
evidence which receptor is involved in 5-ht-induced
contraction in guinea-pig iliac artery.
in earlier studies on guinea-pig iliac arteries, the
contractility to 5-ht receptor agonists including sumatriptan was evaluated using endothelium-intact rings
without focussing on the role of the endothelium (sahin-

erdemli et al. 1991; schoeffter and sahin-erdemli 1992;
pertz 1993). the vascular endothelium, however, has
recently been shown to inhibit the constrictor response to
5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists via the release of no
(maclean et al. 1994; valentin et al. 1996; bhattacharya
et al. 2004). to determine whether this possibility may
also be relevant in guinea-pig iliac artery, we performed
organ bath studies in the absence and presence of lname. in contrast to recently reported findings in bovine
pulmonary artery (maclean et al. 1994), rabbit saphenous
vein and basilar artery (valentin et al. 1996; bhattacharya
et al. 2004), the presence of endothelium in guinea-pig
iliac artery failed to inhibit 5-ht- and sumatriptan-induced
contraction (see table 1). obviously, the ability of the
endothelium to modulate contractility to 5-ht and
sumatriptan is dependent on the vascular bed but this
should be substantiated in further studies.
in endothelium-intact guinea-pig iliac artery, precontracted by a threshold concentration of pgf2alpha, 5-ht
receptor agonists such as 5-ht, 5-ct, and a series of
triptans were able to elicit contractions. agonist potencies
in guinea-pig iliac artery were in good agreement with
those determined in agonist-stimulated gtpgammas binding
experiments using recombinant guinea-pig 5-ht1b receptors in c6-glial cells (pauwels et al. 1998). the observed
agonist potencies of the triptans were also similar to those
reported in human peripheral vessels, e.g., human coronary artery (see table 2) and saphenous vein (maassenvandenbrink et al. 2000). in contrast, agonist potencies of
the triptans in guinea-pig iliac artery were lower than those
reported in human middle meningeal artery (see table 2).
human middle meningeal arteries and coronary arteries
are convenient in-vitro models for  xxxd3263xxx  derivatives to
study their anti-migraine efficacy and side-effect potential,
respectively (maassenvanden brink et al. 2000; van den
broek et al. 2002). due to the agonist potencies of the
triptans determined in the present study, we think that the
guinea-pig isolated iliac artery can be used as a convenient
in-vitro model for studying the contractile responses to
anti-migraine drugs in peripheral blood vessels to evaluate
the side-effect potential of these drugs. it should be
mentioned that close similarities have also been observed
between the agonist potencies of the triptans in guinea-pig
iliac artery and those reported in non-human bioassays
such as the rabbit saphenous vein. this in-vitro model has
previously been used to study anti-migraine efficacy and
vascular side effects of 5-ht1 receptors agonists (wurch et
al. 1997; cohen and schenk 1999).
a further aim of the present study was to show whether
 xxxg1112xxx  receptors might be responsible for  xxxd3263xxx -induced
contractions in guinea-pig iliac artery. the involvement of
 xxxg1112xxx  receptors can be ruled out due to the pharmacological properties of  xxxd3135xxx  and frovatriptan. these
drugs exhibited high affinity for 5-ht1b receptors with a
30- to 40-fold selectivity over  xxxg1112xxx  receptors (johnson
et al. 1997; comer 2002). in the present study, frovatriptan
was the most potent  xxxd3263xxx  derivative showing a greater
than 40-fold potency compared to sumatriptan.  xxxd3135xxx 
displayed a 3-fold higher potency than sumatriptan. on the

61

other hand,  xxxd3135xxx  has been shown to possess a 5–500fold lower potency than other  xxxd3263xxx  derivatives including
sumatriptan in the functional  xxxg1112xxx  receptor-associated
guinea-pig neurogenic dural extravasation model of
migraine (johnson et al. 1997). thus, frovatriptan and
 xxxd3135xxx  are useful tools to discriminate between 5ht1b/1d receptors and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors.
to characterize further 5-ht1-receptor-mediated contractions to triptans in guinea-pig iliac artery, we
performed experiments with selective receptor antagonists.
sb216641 has been shown to possess 30-fold selectivity
for human 5-ht1b receptors over  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (price
et al. 1997). gr127935 is selective for 5-ht1b/1d
receptors without discriminating between both subtypes
(price et al. 1997). contractile responses to the 5-ht
receptor agonists tested were sensitive to both sb216641
(3–10 nm) and gr127935 (1–10 nm), of which the latter
antagonized the contractile responses in an insurmountable
manner. this is in accordance with other studies on
gr127935 against sumatriptan in dog basilar artery and
saphenous vein (skingle et al. 1996). estimates for the
antagonist affinity of sb216641 (apparent pkb=8.4–9.2)
and gr127935 (pd’2=8.5–8.8) are more consistent with
data published for cloned human 5-ht1b receptors
(pki=9.0 for both; price et al. 1997) than for cloned
human  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (pki = 7.6 and 8.6, respectively;
price et al. 1997). the results from our organ bath
experiments are substantiated by the experiments from
molecular biology which reveal the presence of 5-ht1b
receptor mrna and the absence of  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor mrna in guinea pig iliac artery.
in our study two triptans were of special interest due to
their different chemistry and pharmacology,  xxxd3135xxx  and
 xxxd1976xxx .  xxxd3135xxx  is the only  xxxd3263xxx  in therapy without
a sulfonic acid structure. in guinea-pig iliac artery,
 xxxd3135xxx  only acted as a partial agonist of moderate
potency. the contractile response to  xxxd3135xxx  was
insurmountably antagonized by gr127935. in contrast
to all other triptans tested, antagonism by sb216641 (3–
10 nm) to  xxxd3135xxx  did not result in an rightward-shift of
the e/[a] curve and elicited only a moderate depression of
the maximum response. this observation suggests that
 xxxd3135xxx , due to its special chemical structure, may
occupy a different site in the active center of the receptor
than the other triptans. as a consequence,  xxxd3135xxx  may
not compete with sb216641 for the same binding site. the
lipophilic  xxxd1976xxx  was also of special interest. the time
between drug administration and response was significantly longer than to all other 5-ht agonists tested (400 s
vs. 100–250 s, not shown). the e/[a] curve to  xxxd1976xxx 
was biphasic, suggesting two different binding sites for
 xxxd1976xxx . the observation is in accordance with findings
from other groups who have also described a biphasic e/
[a] curve to  xxxd1976xxx . in human coronary artery,
maassenvandenbrink et al. (2000) reported a persistent
increase in the contractile force after administration of
high drug concentrations of  xxxd1976xxx  without reaching a
plateau. in the present study, the high affinity site (0.01–
3 mum; pd2≈6.6) was sensitive to both sb216641 (3–

10 nm) and gr127935 (1–10 nm). the other binding site,
responsible for contractile effects at high concentrations of
 xxxd1976xxx  (>10 mum) was not affected by both antagonists.
this suggests that contractile effects to  xxxd1976xxx  in
guinea-pig iliac artery were mediated by more than one
receptor. while the contractile effects to low concentrations of  xxxd1976xxx  argue for the activation of 5-ht1b
receptors, the identity of the receptor mediating contractile
effects at high concentrations of  xxxd1976xxx  still remains
unclear.
in conclusion we established a guinea-pig in-vitro
model to study the contractile responses to new  xxxd2022xxx  drugs to predict their (cardio)vascular side-effect
profile. furthermore, using 5-ht receptor agonists,
subtype-selective antagonists and rt–pcr, we showed
that the contractile response to 5-ht in guinea-pig iliac
artery is solely mediated by 5-ht1b receptors.
