the recent finding that the fda-approved antiobesity agent orlistat ( xxxd2792xxx , xenical) is a
potent inhibitor of the thioesterase domain of  xxxg765xxx  (fas) led us to develop a concise and
practical asymmetric route to pseudosymmetric 3,4-dialkyl-cis-beta-lactones. the well-documented upregulation of fas in cancer cells makes this enzyme complex an interesting therapeutic target for cancer.
the described route to 3,4-dialkyl-beta-lactones is based on a two-step process involving calter’s catalytic,
asymmetric ketene dimerization of acid chlorides followed by a facial-selective hydrogenation leading
to cis-substituted-beta-lactones. importantly, the ketene dimer intermediates were found to be stable to flash
chromatography, enabling opportunities for subsequent transformations of these optically active, reactive
intermediates. subsequent r-epimerization and r-alkylation or acylation led to trans-beta-lactones and
beta-lactones bearing r-quaternary carbons, respectively. several of the ketene dimers and beta-lactones
displayed antagonistic activity (apparent ki in the low micromolar range) in competition with a fluorogenic
substrate toward a recombinant form of the thioesterase domain of  xxxg765xxx . the best antagonist,
a simple phenyl-substituted cis-beta-lactone 3d, displayed an apparent ki (2.5 ( 0.5 µm) of only ∼10-fold
lower than that of orlistat (0.28 ( 0.06 µm). in addition, mechanistic studies of the ketene dimerization
process by reactionview infrared spectroscopy support previous findings that ketene formation is rate
determining.

introduction
the development of synthetic processes that deliver optically
active products from achiral starting materials in a practical and
catalytic manner continues to be a vital area of research in
organic synthesis.1 in the area of beta-lactone synthesis, the
wynberg process continues to be a benchmark for further
developments in this area.2 several groups have recently

involving nucleophile-catalyzed aldol-lactonizations and lewisacid-catalyzed [2+2] cycloadditions.3 with regard to the former
route, we recently reported an intramolecular, nucleophilecatalyzed aldol-lactonization process building on the work of
wynberg that effectively joins catalytic, asymmetric carbocycle
synthesis with beta-lactone synthesis employing organocatalysis.4

figure 1. schematic diagram of fas showing enzymatic steps involved in fatty acid biosynthesis leading to  xxxd2833xxx . fas is comprised
of six enzymatic domains and an acyl-carrier protein (acp). the steps in fatty acid biosynthesis are as follows. (i) the malonyl/acetyl transferase
domain (1) transfers an acetyl group onto the acp. it is then translocated to the active-site cysteine by r-ketoacyl synthase (2). this position,
marked “r”, also serves as the loading position for the growing acyl chain in subsequent iterations. (ii) the malonyl/acetyl transferase domain (1)
then transfers a malonyl group to the acp, and the two are condensed (2) into a four-carbon product bound to the enzyme through the thiol of the
acp. (iii) the ketoacyl reductase (3) reduces the ketone at c-3 to an alcohol. (iv) the dehydrase (4) further reduces the alcohol to an alkene. (v)
the enoyl reductase domain (5) further reduces the alkene bond to an alkane, and the acp-bound chain is translocated back to the active-site
cysteine (2). steps ii-v are then repeated six times to yield a 16-carbon, fully saturated  xxxd2833xxx  bound to the acp. (vi) the palmitate is
released from fas by the enzyme’s intrinsic thioesterase domain (fas te, 6), which is the target of orlistat and the beta-lactones generated in this
study.

limitation was overcome by use of lewis-acid additives in the
wynberg process by nelson and calter, allowing access to cisbeta-lactones in high enantiopurity.5 in a related process, the calter
group described a novel application of asymmetric organocatalysis for the dimerization of methylketene6 and more recently
several in situ generated ketenes leading to pseudosymmetric,
chiral 3-alkyl-4-methylene-2-oxetanones 2 (scheme 1, 1 f 2).7
these homodimers were typically not isolated but directly ringopened with lithiated secondary amines to provide enolates that
could undergo subsequent aldol reactions leading to polypropionate fragments and ultimately to polyketide natural products.8
important to the process described herein, the geometry of the
olefin in dimer 2 was determined to be z by virtue of the
stereochemical outcome of the subsequent aldol process. in this
article, we describe hydrogenation of isolated, optically active
ketene dimers 2 leading to cis-beta-lactones 3 and subsequent

r-epimerization and alkylations leading to trans-beta-lactones 4
and r,r-disubstituted-beta-lactones, respectively (scheme 1). this
process provides a practical (two steps from acid chlorides) and
complimentary approach to simplified pseudosymmetric dialkylbeta-lactones 3.
our long-standing interest in the development of enantioselective methodologies for beta-lactone synthesis and our recent
discovery that  xxxd2792xxx  (orlistat) potently inhibits fatty
acid synthase (fas)9 prompted us to explore the potential of
optically active ketene dimers as precursors to pseudosymmetric
trans-3,4-dialkyl-beta-lactones 4 and study the ability of these
simplified beta-lactones to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty
acid synthase (fas te) (figure 1). human  xxxg765xxx 
(fas) is the enzyme responsible for cellular synthesis of
palmitate. fas contains seven separate enzymatic pockets that
function sequentially to condense acetyl-coa with malonylcoa to form a four-carbon intermediate. six additional turns
of the enzyme’s cycle convert this intermediate to palmitate,
which is then liberated from fas by the action of the
thioesterase domain.10 fas is attracting great interest as a drug
target in oncology because it is up-regulated in most solid
tumors, including those of the breast,11 prostate,12 and ovary.13
furthermore, a number of studies show that a pharmacologic
blockade of fas can be cytostatic and cytotoxic to tumor cells.14

results and discussion

derivative,
were found to inhibit the ketosynthase (ks)
domain of fas and thus shut down tumor cell proliferation and
in some cases induce apoptosis.17 we recently showed that
orlistat, which bears a beta-lactone and is a drug approved for
treating obesity, is a potent inhibitor of fas te and that this
natural product derivative is cytotoxic and cytostatic to tumor
cells in vitro and can inhibit tumor growth in vivo.9 however,
orlistat has poor solubility and poor bioavailability, so there is
a great need to develop new beta-lactones that overcome these
problems and that can be deployed as potential antitumor drugs.
in addition, simplified derivatives that are readily prepared
would also ultimately be attractive from the standpoint of
process development.
a particularly attractive feature of the described strategy is
its practicality since beta-lactones 4, which are simplified but
structurally analogous to orlistat, could potentially be obtained
in three steps from acid chlorides in optically active form.
following ketene dimerization and hydrogenation, r-epimerization would allow access to the thermodynamically favored
trans-beta-lactones 4 (scheme 1) corresponding to the relative
stereochemistry found in orlistat (5) and also commonly
observed in beta-lactone-containing natural products such as
nocardiolactone (6), the ebelactones (7a,b), and most recently
the belactosins (e.g., belactosin c (8), (figure 2)). furthermore,
given the potential that beta-lactones are showing currently as
inhibitors of several enzymes including proteases,18 hmg  xxxd1739xxx 
synthase,19 esterases, and also the proteasome,20 the ketene
dimerization/hydrogenation process described herein could also
find wider application.

development of a one-pot ketene dimerization/hydrogenation sequence. initial studies focused on the possibility
of developing a one-pot, two-step ketene dimerization/hydrogenation process employing hexanoyl chloride 1a to access
beta-lactone 3a (scheme 2). following ketene dimerization by the
method of calter7 with quinidine (9, figure 3) as nucleophilic
catalyst and simple filtration to remove amine hydrochloride
salts, the reaction mixture was transferred to a hydrogenation
vessel and pressurized to 30 psi of h2. this procedure provided
only modest overall yields of beta-lactone 3a due to apparent
degradation of the ketene dimers in the presence of traces of
dissolved quaternary ammonium salts, a process with precedent
in the literature.21 despite careful filtration of the amine salts
prior to hydrogenation, extensive degradation of the dimer was
always observed. more significantly, the enantiopurity of the
ketene dimer (97% f 78% ee at 40% conversion) and thus the
enantiopurity of the beta-lactone (97% f 74% ee) were found to
erode during the hydrogenation, thus rendering this method
ineffective for obtaining highly enantiopure beta-lactones. the
stereochemistry of beta-lactone 3a was assigned based on coupling
constant analysis (jcis ≈ 6 hz, jtrans 4-4.5 hz)22 and subsequently confirmed by x-ray analysis of the cyclohexyl-containing beta-lactone 3c (vide infra).
isolation and purification of ketene dimers. to avoid
erosion of optical purity and degradation during the hydrogenation step, we studied the stability of ketene dimers 2 toward
isolation and purification. previous large-scale synthesis and
purification of racemic ketene dimers bearing long alkyl chains
(>13 carbons) relied on acidic extraction to remove alkylam-

monium salts followed by vacuum distillation, and this could
potentially be applied to the asymmetric process described
herein.23 however, in efforts to develop a procedure that would
be tolerant of acid-sensitive functionality and avoid extensive
heating, we studied the stability of ketene dimers to silica gel
chromatography. indeed, we were able to purify all ketene
dimers by normal silica gel flash chromatography. ketene dimer
2a possessed sufficient stability to allow determination of its
enantiomeric purity by gas chromatography using cyclodextrin
bis-otbs as chiral stationary phase.24 beta-lactones (r)-2a and
(s)-2a were obtained in high optical purity by use of either qnd
(9, >98% ee) or o-tms quin (12, >96% ee), respectively
(table 1, entries 1 and 5). the enantiopurity of other dimers
was determined following hydrogenation to the cis-beta-lactones
(vide infra). silylated alkaloids gave comparable yields of ketene
dimer 3a compared to in situ generated, acetylated derivatives
(table 1, entry 1 vs 2).25 a slight improvement in yield was
realized when shorter reaction times were employed (6 vs 24
h), consistent with our finding that the ketene dimer is unstable
to prolonged exposure to trialkylammonium salts (table 1,
entries 1-3 vs 4). the yield of ketene dimer could be improved
further by use of doubly-distilled acid chloride (75% vs 62%
yield, table 1, entry 4 vs 5). while our work was in progress,
calter reported that ketene dimers derived from propanoyl
chloride and malonyl chloride half-ester could be purified by
rapid filtration through silica gel.7 the ability to isolate and
purify optically active ketene dimers 2 greatly extends the
potential utility of these intermediates for beta-lactone synthesis,
allowing for subsequent transformations including epoxidation
as reported by us recently, leading to novel spiro-epoxy-betalactones.26
hydrogenation of ketene dimers. we next studied the
hydrogenation of the isolated ketene dimers. prior hydrogenation
studies of diketenes have primarily focused on the parent
diketene, 4-methylene-2-oxetanone, in both racemic and asymmetric fashion, as a means to obtain the corresponding 4-methyl2-oxetanone, a commodity chemical utilized on ton scale for
polymer applications.27 several catalysts have been utilized for
hydrogenation of enol ethers;28 however, for simplicity and
practicality, palladium on carbon was studied initially with

racemic ketene dimer 2a. at the outset, we expected high facial
selectivity for the hydrogenation due to the proximity of the
alkene to the r-stereogenic carbon at c3 of the beta-lactone.
however, hydrogenation of dimer 2a employing 5 mol % pd/c
(5 wt %) resulted in high yield but low diastereoselectivity,
providing a mixture of cis- and trans-beta-lactones 3a (4:1 favoring
cis) after a 24 h reaction time (entry 1, table 2). addition of
100 mol % triethylamine relative to pd catalyst, in an attempt
to reduce the activity of the catalyst, improved the diastereoselectivity to 17:1 with the same reaction time (entry 2, table
2). however, repeating these conditions with optically active
dimer 2a (98% ee) indicated that racemization was occurring
under these conditions necessarily at the dimer stage, providing
cis-beta-lactone 3a with reduced enantiopurity (71% ee). shortening the reaction time using 5 mol % catalyst without added et3n
also gave high diastereoselectivity (entry 3, table 2). taken
together, these results suggest that both longer reaction times
and the absence of catalyst poison leads to erosion in diastereoselectivity. optimal conditions that prevented racemization
and maintained high diastereoselectivity were eventually realized
by decreasing the amount of pd/c to 1 mol % and reducing the
reaction time to 30 min under 30 psi of h2 pressure without
et3n. under these conditions, no racemization or epimerization
was observed for either the ketene dimer or the major diastereomer isolated, cis-beta-lactone 3a. the latter could be isolated
in 90% yield as a >19:1 mixture of cis/trans diastereomers 3a
as determined by coupling constant analysis (3a, jha,hb ) 6.3
hz) in 96% ee (table 2, entry 4).29 in this manner, hydrogenation of a series of ketene dimers 2a-f gave consistently high
yields of the corresponding beta-lactones 3a-f with high enantiomeric purities (table 3). enantiomer ratios were determined
by chiral gc analysis following hydrogenation. racemic
beta-lactone 3c was crystalline, and thus, x-ray analysis verified
the cis stereochemistry obtained during hydrogenation and
suggested by coupling constant analysis for the entire series
(figure 4).

r-epimerization of cis- to trans-beta-lactones. as described
above, the majority of naturally occurring beta-lactones possess
trans-beta-lactone stereochemistry including orlistat (see figure
2). thus, we explored conditions to epimerize to the thermodynamically preferred trans-beta-lactones. deprotonation leading
to beta-lactone enolates is possible since beta-elimination in these
systems is a symmetry forbidden process.30 competing intermolecular claisen condensations can be precluded provided
there is an r-substituent; however, in some cases, low yields
of r-monoalkylated systems have been obtained using inverse
addition with highly reactive electrophiles.31 numerous thermodynamic conditions to effect epimerization were studied

however, all these conditions gave low conversion to the transisomers along with decomposition. ultimately, an unsatisfying
but functional procedure was developed involving kinetic
deprotonation and quenching to provide a mixture of cis- and
trans-beta-lactones, which could then be separated by silica gel
chromatography to deliver pure trans-isomers 3a and 3c

alkylation/acylation of cis-beta-lactones. enolization with
lithium hexamethyldisilazide (lihmds) followed by addition
of various electrophiles proved more fruitful and allowed access
to beta-lactones bearing r-quaternary centers. alkylation proceeded
with high diastereoselectivity when benzyl bromide was employed (entries 2 and 3, table 4), whereas the smaller electrophile, methyl iodide, provided only moderate diastereoselectivity
(entry 1, table 4), as previously observed for beta-lactones with
moderately sized beta-substituents.32 the relative stereochemistry
of the major diastereomer of benzyl-beta-lactone 8b was determined by noe analysis.33 in the case of acylation with benzyl

overall dimerization process. figures 5 and 6 show results of
reactionview ir monitoring for the overall dimerization
reaction of hydrocinnamoyl chloride in ch2cl2 (0.1 m) leading
to ketene dimer 2d. under reaction conditions i, the nucleophilic catalyst, tms-qnd (10), is added 5 min after the addition
of etni-pr2 (hünig’s, dipea) base at 30 min (figure 5). under
these conditions, three distinct species (i) hydrocinnamoyl
chloride (1793 cm-1), (ii) 3-phenyl prop-1-en-1-one (2118
cm-1), and (iii) 3-benzyl-4-(2-phenylethylidene)oxetan-2-one
(2d, 1710 cm-1) were detected and monitored over a period of
540 min. the data are plotted as absorbance versus time in a
two-dimensional format (figure 5a) and three-dimensional
format (figure 5b) following peak fitting (reactionview
software). upon addition of 1.0 equiv of hünig’s base at t )
30 min to the hydrocinnamoyl chloride, ketene generation is
immediately initiated, and after 5 min, a 50% decrease in
absorbance for hydrocinnamoyl chloride is observed. separate
experiments revealed that ketene was stable at this temperature
for at least 15 min. subsequent addition of tms-qnd (10) at
t ) 35 min completely consumes the ketene after 44 min.
however, a brief induction period is observed wherein ketene
dimer formation is retarded until hydrocinnamoyl chloride is
almost consumed at t )160 min. it is clear that under these
conditions the formed ketene is rapidly consumed, and following
this time, presumably an undetectable amount of ketene is
produced slowly from acid chloride, leading to complete
conversion to ketene dimer 2d.
in a second experiment the order of addition of reagents was
altered (reaction conditions ii, figure 6). addition of hydrocinnamoyl chloride at t ) 18.3 min to a mixture of hünig’s
base and tms-qnd immediately produced ketene dimer along
with a trace amount of ketene. under these reaction conditions

it appears that the rate of ketene consumption exceeds that of
ketene generation in accordance with the results above and also
those observed by calter,7 and thus, the ketene resonance is
fleeting on the time scale of mid-ir measurements. these
reactionview studies provide further evidence for a ratedetermining ketene generation step followed by rapid ketene
dimerization as found previously by calter during rate studies
of the ketene dimerization process.7a
enzyme inhibition studies. a recombinant form of the
thioesterase domain of  xxxg765xxx  was used in a
substrate-based screen to measure the apparent ki’s of ketene
dimers 2a-d and both cis-beta-lactone and trans-isomers of the
derived simplified orlistat derivatives. importantly, orlistat is
presumed to be a covalent inhibitor of the fas te domain, in
analogy to the adduct formed with the active site serine of
 xxxg1789xxx .34 we presume that all of the beta-lactones
examined in this study function via the same mechanism.
therefore, the results are reported as apparent inhibition
constants (app ki), as the term ki is usually used for reversible
inhibitors. 4-methylumbelliferyl  xxxd2269xxx  (4-muh) was
utilized as a substrate for fas te as it was found to provide

the product of this substrate, 4-methylumbelliferone, fluoresces
at 450 nm (excitation at 350 nm) and provides a convenient
readout of thioesterase activity. in this assay, the hydrolysis of
4-muh is blocked by orlistat, our lead antagonist with an
apparent ki of 0.21 µm. the ability of the various beta-lactones
and some ketene dimer precursors described above to act as
antagonists of 4-muh toward recombinant fas te was

measured by this assay (table 5). the beta-lactones were tested
across a concentration range of 1-100 µm, and the doseresponse curve for trans-beta-lactone 3a is shown as a representative example (figure 7).
ketene dimers were tested and showed moderate activity (516 µm) with the exception of dimer 2c which showed no activity
(table 5, entries 1-4). the most potent ketene dimer tested
was phenyl derivative 2d with an app ki of ∼5.0 µm, which is
approximately 25-fold less potent than orlistat.
in the cis-isomeric series (table 5, entries 9-15), addition
of an ester substituent in proximity to the beta-lactone nucleus
led to a drastic reduction in activity (table 5, entry 14).
however, a remote methoxy substituent as in beta-lactone cis-3f
(entry 15) restored activity comparable to that observed for the
n-butyl-substituted beta-lactone, cis-3a (entry 10).35 as expected,
the trans-isomers, in general, were found to possess greater
inhibitory activity compared to the cis-isomers with the same
substituents (entries 5-8 vs 10-13). beta-lactones 8a-c bearing
r-quaternary carbons showed moderate activity (10-19 µm)
but presumably also lead to covalent adducts suggestive of the
possibility that the thioesterase domain is not selective for only
3,4-disubstituted-beta-lactones.
in the case of the phenyl-substituted ketene dimer 2d (5.0
µm), a ∼2-fold increase in activity to 2.5 µm was observed
following hydrogenation to give the phenyl-substituted cis-betalactone 3d (table 5, entry13). surprisingly, little variation in
activity is observed (3.3 µm, entry 8) when this derivative is
epimerized to trans-beta-lactone 3d possessing the relative and
absolute stereochemistry corresponding to that found in orlistat.
although none of the simple 3,4-dialkyl-beta-lactones described
herein were found to be as potent as orlistat, the findings are
significant since these are highly simplified beta-lactones devoid
of the n-formyl aminoester side chain. these polar substituents
are expected to serve as additional recognition sites via potential
hydrogen-bonding and polar-polar interactions to fas te. in
addition, they should also contribute to water solubility.
however, a promising lead compound for further optimization
is the phenyl-substituted derivative trans-3d.
in summary, we developed a scaleable process to prepare
cis-3,4-disubstituted beta-lactones using a ketene dimerization/
hydrogenation sequence from readily available acid chlorides
in good overall yields and high enantioselectivity. this reaction
could be run as a single-pot, two-step process, but higher overall
yields and optical purities were obtained upon isolation of the
ketene dimer by silica gel chromatography and subsequent
hydrogenation of the purified ketene dimer at moderate pressures. several ketene dimers were isolable, and their enantiomeric purity could be determined by chiral gc analysis. a
current limitation in this process is the accessibility of only
pseudosymmetric ketene dimers 2 via the calter procedure
(35) for previous studies of the impact of beta-lactone stereochemistry and
substitution on enzyme inhibitory activity, see: (hmg-coa synthase) (a)

leading to pseudosymmetric beta-lactones 3. enolization followed
by alkylation and acylation of the cis-beta-lactones provided ready
access to r,r-disubstituted beta-lactones with high diastereoselectivities. trans-beta-lactones could also be obtained by r-epimerization in low yield; however, a general, practical solution for
this process remains elusive. these highly simplified dialkylbeta-lactones are analogous to the natural products norcardiolactone, valilactone, and orlistat and were found to exhibit moderate
to good inhibitory activity toward recombinant fas te as
measured by enzymatic activity using recombinant protein with
a fluorogenic substrate. the best antagonist, cis-beta-lactone 3d,
displayed an app ki of only ∼10-fold less than that of orlistat.
in addition, analysis of the ketene dimerization process by
reactionview ir spectroscopy further substantiates findings by
calter that ketene formation is rate determining in the catalyzed
ketene dimerization process. further transformations of these
optically pure ketene homodimers are being explored as a means
to provide practical routes to beta-lactones more structurally
analogous to orlistat and expected to have higher affinity for
fas te. in addition, the use of hetero-ketene dimers will
expand the beta-lactone structures accessible by this strategy.

racemic ketene dimers were initially prepared in a similar
manner using hünig’s base. subsequently, 5 mol % quinuclidine
hydrochloride with 1.0 equiv of hünig’s base gave optimal results
in terms of reaction rate and yield; therefore, this method was
subsequently used for preparation of racemic ketene dimers.

general experimental procedure for in situ mid-ir spectroscopy with a remspec reactionview system. a remspec
reaction view system was fitted with a double-pass liquid
transmission head that was placed into a flame-dried two-necked
20 × 2.3 cm reaction tube equipped with a spin vane stir bar, and
the reaction flask was placed under a nitrogen atmosphere.
following addition of 30 ml of ch2cl2, a background spectrum
was obtained for 15 min and then automatic data collection was
initiated and provided 45 scans/min for both experiments at 23 °c.
the data collected for hydrocinnamoyl chloride, ketene, and ketene
dimer for both experiments were peak fitted with a lorentzian
function on grams/ai software and normalized on microsoft excel
to obtain absorbance versus time curves.
reaction condition i. sequential addition of hydrocinnamoyl
chloride (0.45 ml, 2.97 mmol; t ) 14.5 min) and 565 µl of hünig’s
base (2.97 mmol; t ) 30 min) gave rise to expected acid chloride
and ketene absorbances. after complete consumption of acid
chloride, 5 mol % tms-qn (22 mg) was added as a solution in 1
ml of ch2cl2 in one portion at t ) 35 min, and data was collected
for an additional 540 min.
reaction condition ii. in this procedure 5 mol % tms-qn
(22 mg) and 565 µl of hünig’s base was added to 30 ml of ch2cl2. at t ) 18.3 min, hydrocinnamoyl chloride (0.45 ml, 2.97
mmol) was added over a period of 5 min and data was collected
for an additional 230 min.

fluorogenic assay for detection of enzyme inhibition.
expression of the recombinant thioesterase domain of fas was
performed as described previously,9 and large-scale expression was
performed by invitrogen corp. (madison, wi). the synthetic
fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl  xxxd2269xxx  (4-muh),
was purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). the reaction mixture
consisted of 45 µl of 500 nm fas te in buffer a (100 mm trishcl, 50 mm nacl at ph 7.4) which was preincubated with 2.5 µl
of stock solutions of test beta-lactones dissolved in dmso at final
concentrations of 0.32-100 µm at 37 °c for 30 min. the reaction
was initiated by addition of 5 µl of 1.25 mm 4-muh in 1:1 dmso:
buffer a. the resulting fluorescence from liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was measured every 5 min at 350/450 nm for 40-60
min. results are the average of triplicate time points in which the
typical standard deviation was <5%. each compound was tested
at least twice, yielding essentially identical results.
