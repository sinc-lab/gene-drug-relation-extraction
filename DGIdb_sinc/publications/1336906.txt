dihydrotachysterolj,
a reduced for hydrogenated) analog of vitamin d, in which the a ring has been
rotated through 180”, is, after hepatic 25-hydroxylation, converted in vivo to a dihydroxylated metabolife, termed peak h, which is at present unidentified but with good afhnity for the  xxxg2412xxx .
although peak h is made in relatively large amounts in vivo, it has not yet been possible to synthesize
it in vitro. mass spectrometric evidence suggests that peak h is 25-hydroxylated and the presumption
that it is a metabolite of 2.5-hydroxydihydrotachystero!,
was confirmed by the demonstration that
radiolabeledpeak h was formed in vivo in the rat after injection of25-hydroxy-[10,19-3h] xxxd1891xxx ,, produced from [io,l9-“hldihydrotachystero!,
in a hepatic cell model. the metabolism of 25
hydroxy-[10,19-‘h]dihydrotachystero13
was also studied in a rat osteosarcoma cell umr-106, a known
target cell for vitamin d, using high (11 pm) and low (10 nm) substrate concentrations. metabolic
products were isolated by lipid extraction, purihed by high-performance
liquid chromatography,
and
characterized by direct-probe mass spectrometry and gas chromatographylmass
spectrometry.
the
formation of peak h from 25-hydroxydihydrotachystero!,
could not be demonstrated in umr-106
cells. however, 25-hydroxydihydrotachystero13
was metabolized to at least seven side-chain modi$ed
metabolites, each of which was extensively characterized and tentatively identified. it is concluded that
the vitamin d enzyme system present in umr-106 cells is able to metabolize dihydrotachystero!,
very
efhciently to a series of metabolites but is incapable of producing peak h. (steroids 57236-243,

the active form of vitamin d, 1,2sdihydroxyvitamin
d, (1,25-(oh),d,).3 recent work in our laboratories
has shown that dht, undergoes extensive metabolism
in vivo to at least 14 different metabolites.4 seven of
these were also observed as metabolites of 25ohdht, in vitro using the perfused rat kidney and were
shown to be analogous to degradation products of vitamin d since they belonged to putative 24-oxidation
and 26,23-lactone pathways.4 one in vivo metabolite of
dht, which we termed peak h, proved to be extremely
interesting since it possessed chromatographic properties similar to lc~,25-(oh)~d, (ref. 5) and had strong
affinity for the vdr,6 but it was not synthesized in the
kidney in vitro.4 thus, peak h could represent the
active metabolite of dht.
apart from the kidney, there are only a few other
tissues thought to be capable of extensive metabolism
of vitamin d and these might also produce peak h. one
such extrarenal tissue is the bone (primarily osteo-

blast), in which recent work using cultured embryonic
osteoblasts,’ osteosarcoma cells (e.g., umr-106, human u20s),839and osteoblasts from cultured explants’
has shown that cells of this origin are capable of the
synthesis of 1,25-(oh),d,, 24,25-(oh)~d~,and their
further metabolites. we considered the possibility that
osteoblasts might be capable of the synthesis of peak
h and asked two questions: (1) can peak h be produced from 25oh-dht3 in an osteosarcoma cell line,
umr-106, in vitro? and (2) are the extrarenal hydroxylases of umr-106 capable of metabolizing 25ohdht, to other derivatives in vitro, thereby revealing
important details about the specificity of the enzymes
involved? this paper describes the results of experiments designed to answer these two questions.

 xxxg257xxx  chemicals ltd. (toronto, ontario, canada). solvents were
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) grade from
caledon (georgetown, ontario, canada).
the human hepatoma-derived ceil line, hep 3b, was obtained
from american tissue culture collection. umr-i~ cells8 were
obtained from dr. j.n.m. heersche, university of toronto (toronto, canada). trypsin,  xxxd2871xxx ,  xxxd2193xxx ,  xxxd164xxx ,
earle’s medium, and mccoy’s medium were purchased from
gibco. fetal calf serum (fcs) was purchased from flow laboratories.
male wistar rats (average, 300 g) purchased from charles
river inc. (st. constant, quebec, canada) were used in in vivo
experiments. [10,19-‘h]dht, (47 ciimmol) was custom synthesized by amersham, uk, by reduction of tachysterol,.

generation of [i 0, 19-3h]25-oh-dht, from
~l~,~9-3h~~ht~using hep 3b cells
hep 3b cells were grown in 25- and 75cm2 culture flasks containing 10 or 20 ml, respectively, of earle’s minimum essential
medium supplemented with l-glutamine (4 mm), 10% fcs,  xxxd2871xxx  (100 pg/ml),  xxxd2193xxx  (5 pglml), and  xxxd164xxx  (300
ng/ml).‘o cultures were maintained at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co, in air in which the medium was changed every
3 days. near confluency, the medium was discarded and nearly
confluent monolayers were incubated with unlabeled dht, (16
pg/2 ml unsupplemented minimum essential medium in t-25
flasks; 20 pm or 48 &6 ml unsupplemented minimum essential
medium in t-75 flasks; 20 pm). incubations were continued
for a further 72 hours under the same culture conditions. lipid
extraction of ceils and medium followed by hplc on a zorbaxsil column using a hexanefisopro~no~meth~ol
solvent system, as explained below, showed a major metabolite bearing the
characteristic uv spectrum of dht. such a compound was
purified and identified as 25-oh-dht, by co-migration with the
authentic compound on two hplc systems and its structural
identification confirmed by direct probe mass spectrometry of

10 nm) (figure 1). the product was identified by its retention
time and was found to have a specific activity equal to that
of the starting material, [10,19-3hjdht~. incubations at higher
[io, 19-3h]dht, concentrations led to an equally high percentage
conversion to [10,19-3h]25-oh-dht3 (approximately 5%).
thus, the feedback control on the 25-hydroxylation reported for
vitamin d10-‘2was not seen for dht.

osteosarcoma cell line incubations
umr-106 cells were grown in 25- or 150-cm2 culture flasks containing 10 or 50 ml, respectively, of mccoy’s modified 5a medium supplemented with 10% fcs,  xxxd2871xxx ,  xxxd2193xxx ,
and  xxxd164xxx , as with hep 3b cells. similarly, cultures were
maintained at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co, in air
in which the medium was changed every 3 days.
at late log phase of growth, cells were treated with ethanol
(vehicle) or with 10 nm 1,25-(oh&d, for 4 hours to induce vitamin d side-chain hydroxylase enzymess8 for studies using radioisotopically labeled metabolites the t-25 flasks were used, the
medium was discarded, and the cells were washed with 10 ml
phosphate-buffered saline. then [10,19-3h]25-oh-dht3 (5 x
io5cpm) was added to 2 ml 10% fcs-supplemented medium/
t-25 flasks and the total concentration of 10 nm 25-oh-dht,
was completed by the addition of unlabeled substrate.
for preparative generation of unlabeled metabolites, t-150
flasks were used for further identification. 1,25-(oh)zd3-induced
cells were washed with 20 ml phosphate-buffered saline and 45
pg 25-oh-dht, was added in 10 ml 10% fcs-supplemented
medium/t150 flasks at a final concentration of 1i fm.
incubations were carried out for 24 hours at 37 c on a 60 cycle/
min shaker and were terminated by the addition of methanol, the
first step in lipid extraction.

lipid extraction
cells and medium were extracted using a modification of the
method of bligh and dyer,j3 substituting methyiene chloride for

hplc.

high-performance

liquid chromntography

purification and analysis were carried out on a system consisting
of a combination of a 712 sample injector, a model 590 pump,
and a model 990 photodiode array assembly (supplied by waters
scientific, milford, ma, usa). separations were obtained on a
6-frn zorbax-sil

(9 i : 7 : 2) at a row rate of 2 mlimin.‘”
for unlabeled metabolites,
peaks bearing the characteristic
uv spectrum of dht compounds were collected, redissolved in
him (94 : s : 1) and run on either a 3-pm zorbax-sil (0.62 x 8

zorbax-cn (0.46 x 25 cm) column using him (94 : 5 : 1)at a flow
rate of 1.3 mlimin.” the second column was used for further
purification and identification
before preparation for chemical
modification and mass spectrometry.
for radioisotopically
labeled metabolites, automatic analytical hplc was performed using instruments comprising a model
440 pump, a wisp automatic sample injector, and a fixed wavelength uv detector (254 nm) (waters associates, milford, ima,
usa). haif-minute fractions were collected, dried down under
air. and redissolved
in organic scintillation fluid (readysafe,
beckman) followed by scintillation counting in an automatic
counter (model ls7500, beckman instruments).
fractions of
radioactive peaks were pooled and subjected to further identification by hplc and chemical modification.

results

direct probe mass spectrometry
was carried out on isolated and
purified metabolites using a model hps985 mass spectrometer
(hewlett-packard)
fitted with a direct insert probe.4 samples (500
ng to wg) were introduced in him 94 : 5 : 1 and the probe heated
from 20 to 200 c at a programmed rate of 15 cimin. ionization
voltage was 70 ev. positive ion el (electron impact) spectra
were recorded and stored on disk using a hewlett-packard
series
21mx-e computer.
mass spectra of the pe~rimethyisily1
ethers of metabolites
were obtained by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry
(cc/
ms).’ purified metabolites
were derivatized with 50 /*i of ntrimethylsilyl
imidazole (tmsi) incubated for 1 hour at 50 c.
the products were dissolved in hexane and passed through a
small prewashed  xxxd2096xxx  column to remove excess tmsi. samples were then dried down and transferred to small conical vials
for injection into the gc. gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry was carried out on a hewlett-packard
5890 gc using an hpi cross-linked methyl silicone gum (12 m x 0.2 mm x 0.33 pm
film thickness) column with helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1
ml/min using a 5970 series mass selective detector. mass spectra
were obtained by averaging each peak and subtracting the background.

the metabolism of 10 nm [3h]25-o~-~ht~ in umr106 cells led to the generation of ten ‘h-labeled metabolites. figure 2 shows the chromatographic profile of the
umr-106 extract on a zorbax-sil column. a similar
profile was generated using ethanol (vehicle)-treated
cells, except that peaks were quantitatively reduced
over 1,25(oh)~d~-induced ceils (data not shown).
peaks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were collected and rerun,
separately, on a second hplc step using a zorbaxcn column. ten peaks of radioactivity were resolved.
seven of these 10 radioactive metabolites were characterized by their chromatographic
mobility in the two
hplc systems used in this study and by sensitivity
to sodium m-periodate as explained in table 1. such
identification was also based on a similar pattern described in the perfused rat kidney4 as well as by comparison with metabolites detected by their uv spectrum
in extracts from umr-106 cells incubated with high
concentrations of the unlabeled substrate as described
below.

the preparative scale umr-106 incubations with 11
pm 25oh-dht3 were carried out to generate sufficient quantities of metabolites for structural identification. the same 10 metabolites of 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol,
detected
by their characteristic
uv spectrum, were formed, although in different proportions. figure 3 illustrates the hplc pattern on a
zorbax-sil column of the preparative cell incubations
extract showing the substrate and four major metabolites with their typical dht spectra. three of these
metabolites were generated in sufficient quantities and
were identified by their chromatographic behavior and
mass spectra, as explained iater, as 24-oxo-25ohdht,, 23,25-(oh),dht,, and 24,25-(oh),dht,. the
fourth metabolite
was resolved from the 23,25(oh),dht, peak and was identified as 24-0x0-23,25(oh)*dht, by its chromatographic
behavior and by
co-elution with an authentic standard. a fifth metabolite, which was the most polar and thus is not shown in
figure 3, could nevertheless be generated in sufficient
quantity
to be identified
by ms as 23,2.5,26(oh)3dht3, as explained later. in contrast to 10 nm
incubations, in which two more major metabolites,
25-oh-dht~-26,23-lactone
and 25oh-dht,-26,23lactol, were formed (figure 2, table l), the two metabolites were not observed in significant amounts when
high substrate concentrations
were used. therefore,
the identification of both metabolites was based merely
on their uv spectra, chromatographic behavior, and
sensitivity to chemical reactions in comparison with
data reported in the rat kidney perfusion study.4

24-oxo-25-oh-dhts.
this metabolite had a retention
time of 8.7 minutes on the zorbax-sil column, but it

qaw at al.

was more strongly retained, relative to 25oh-dht,,
on the zorbax-cn column (table 1). this suggests the
presence of an 0x0 group in this least polar 25ohdht, metabolite. the insensitivity to sodium periodate
treatment suggests the absence of vicinal hydroxyls.
direct probe ms of the underivatized
compound
showed a molecular ion at m/z 416, which indicated the
addition of 14 mass units to the substrate 25oh-dht3
(m+402), suggesting the addition of one oxygen and the
loss of two hydrogens (figure 4a). a major fragment at
m/z 358 was present, which was probably derived from
the loss of 58 mass units by c-24-c-25 cleavage. this
suggests that the additional 0x0 group is at c-24. the
mass fragment at m/z 255 representing the loss of side
chain and dehydration at c-3 can also be seen, as well
as the fragment at m/z 121 representing ring a-h20
after the c-7-c-8 cleavage. gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry of the per-trimethylsilyl ether derivative
(figure 4b) gave the molecular ion of m/z 560, representing the addition of two trimethylsilanol groups and
indicating the presence of only two hydroxyl groups.
major mass fragments can be seen at m/z 131 (c-25, c26, c-27-otmsi fragment)‘, m/z 545 (m- 15)+, m/z 470
(m-90)+, and m/z 255. aildata available are consistent
with this metabolite being identical to one isolated from
a perfused kidney model4 and with it being 24-0x0-25oh-dht?.
23,~-(oh)~dht~.
this metabolite eluted at the front
edge of 24-oxo-23,25-(oh),dht,
on a zorbax-sil column and could not be resolved on this hplc system.
however, on a zorbax-cn column it did not change
its position and it was resolved from 24-0x0-23,25(oh)*dhti, which was retained for a longer time. direct probe ms of the underivatized compound gave a
molecular ion at m/z 418, an increase of 16 mass units
from the substrate, which could be due to the addition
of an extra hydroxyl group to 2%oh-dht, (figure
4c). the presence of mass fragments at m/z 273 (mside chain)+, m/z 255 (m-side chain-h,o)+ and m/z
121 (a ring-h,o) after c-7-c-8 cleavage suggested
that the extra hydroxyi was on the side chain excluding
c-24, c-25, c-26, and c-27. the mass fragment at m/z
344 could represent the loss of a c-24,c-25,c-26, xxxd962xxx -oh fragment due to the c-23-c-24 cleavage, as
reported in a similar metabolite from kidney perfusate.4
gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry of the pertrimethylsilyl ether derivative (figure 4d) gave the moiecular ion at m/z 634, indicating the presence of three
tmsi groups, which includes an extra tmsi over derivatized 25oh-dht,.
the mass fragment at m/z 489
could indicate again the loss of 145 mass units of the
c-24,c-25,c-26,c-27-0tmsi
fragment due to the c23-c-24 cleavage. other fragments can also be seen at
m/z 544 (m-90)‘, m/z 454 (m-90-90)‘, m/z 364 (m-90
-9o-90), m/z 398 (m-145-90)+, m/z 308 (m-145-90-90)+,
m/z 255 (m-side chain-90)+, and m/z 131 (c-25,-26,

of the c-23-c-24 bond, are in agreement with data
obtained from the same compound formed in the kidsteroids, 1992, vol. 57, may

this metabolite had a retention time of 9.6 minutes on a zorbax-sil column preceding the next metabolite, 24,25-(oh),dht,,
however, on a zorbax-cn column this order of elution was

probe ms of the underivatized compound gave a molecular ion at m/z 418, where the extra 16 mass units
suggest the addition of a hydroxyl to 25-oh-dht,. the
presence of other mass fragments at m/z 273 (m-side
chain) + , m/z 255 (m-side chain-h20) + , and m/z 12 1 (a
ring-h,o) indicated that the extra hydroxyl group is
on the side chain. the compound was susceptible to
sodium periodate oxidation (table 1) giving a broad
peak, similar to that reported for the compound identified in kidney perfusate in addition to 24,25-(oh),ds.
this susceptibility to periodate oxidation suggests that
the extra hydroxyl group is on c-24, c-26, or c-27. gas
chromatography/mass
spectrometry of the pertrimethylsilyl ether derivative gave a molecular ion at m/z
634, indicating the introduction of three trimethylsilyl
groups. the mass fragments at m/z 131 (c-25,c-26, xxxd962xxx -otmsi)’ and m/z 413 (m-131-90)+ suggest that c24 is the most likely site for the extra hydroxyl group.
other mass fragments can be seen at m/z 544 (m-90) + ,
m/z 454 (m-90-90)+, and m/z 255. all data suggest that
this compound is 24,25-(oh),dht,.

this metabolite had a retention time of 12.5 minutes on the zorbax-sil column, eluting only 1 minute behind 24,25-(oh)zdht,
(table 1). on zorbax-cn, however, it was retained
more than 8 minutes behind 24,25-(oh)~dht~, indicating the presence of an 0x0 group. sodium periodate
treatment had no effect on this compound. in addition
to its  xxxd2437xxx  counte~art,
this metabolite was a minor
product and, at high substrate concentration levels, its
yield was insufficient for ms studies. the available
data are in agreement with that reported on the same
metabolite isolated from kidney perfusate and suggest
that the metabolite is 2%oh-dht,-26,23-lactone.

this .metabolite showed a
highly characteristic broad peak during hplc, resembling that reported for the same metabolite from kidney
perfusate. it had a retention time of 16 minutes on the
zorbax-sil column some 3.5 minutes after the lactone.
on zorbax-cn it eluted 4 minutes ahead of the lactone.
it was susceptible to periodate oxidation, indicating the
presence of vicinal oxygen functions. because of the
poor yields of this metabolite, no ms studies were
carried out. comparison of data reported on the same
metabolite isolated from kidney perfusate suggests that
this metabolite is 25oh-dht,-26,23- xxxd2437xxx .
23,25,26-(oh),dht,. this metabolite had a retention
time of 24.5 minutes on the zorbax-sil column, which
makes it the most polar metabolite of 25oh-dht,
formed in this study (table i). no increased retention
on the zorbax-cn column was observed. the metabolite was susceptible to periodate oxidation, suggesting
the presence of vicinal oxygen functions. enough compound was formed in this study, in contrast to the
kidney perfusate study, to carry out direct probe ms
on the underivatized metabolite. it gave a molecular
ion at m/z 434, indicating the presence of two additional
hydroxyl groups over 25oh-dht, (as concluded from
the extra 32 mass units which account for two extra
oxygen molecules). a small but significant mass fragment was observed at m/z 342, which is attributed to
c-23-c-24 cleavage, suggesting c-23 as a site for one
of the extra hydroxyl groups. other fragments were
also observed at m/z 273 (m-side chain)+, m/z 255 (mside chain-h,o), and m/z 121 (a ring-h,o). gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of the pertrimethylsilyl
ether derivative gave a molecular ion at m/z 722 (which,
because of a mass discrimination error, was labeled as
m/z 723), indicating the incorporation of four trimethylsilyl groups, again suggesting the addition of two extra
hydroxyl groups to 25oh-dht,. major and distinctive
mass fragments were observed at m/z 489, m/z 399, and
m/z 309 and are attributed to the loss of 233 mass units,
after c-23-c-24 cleavage, and subsequent loss of two
silanol groups. the absence of an ion at m/z 131 suggests a further substitution, in addition to 2%hydroxylation, on one of the terminal methyl groups of the side
chain. in support of this suggestion, instead of the mass
fragment at m/z 131 seen with 25hydroxylated
compounds and associated with cleavage between c-24 and
c-25, a mass fragment at m/z 219 was observed, suggesting the presence of an additional derivatized hydroxyl group on c-26 or c-27. all data suggest that this
metabolite is 23,25,26-(oh),dht,,
the precursor of
26,23- xxxd2437xxx  and 26,23-lactone of 2%oh-dht,.

discussion
we have shown that the rat osteosarcoma cell umr106, is capable of metabolizing 25oh-dht,
into a
number of side-chain oxidation products, previously
observed in the rat in vivo and also in the perfused rat
kidney in vitro.4 all these metabolites can be placed on
two catabolic pathways, namely, the c-24-oxidation
pathway and the c-26-23 lactone pathway observed for
vitamin d,. “.” all metabolites were produced in the
umr-106 system in nanogram and microgram quantities, permitting fairly rigorous characterization of their
structure by physicochemical
techniques, including
hplc, gcims, and derivatization. the production of
these metabohtes by the osteosarcoma cell again shows
that the enzymes responsible for target cell destruction
of 25oh-d, and the hormone 1,25(oh),d, have a
fairly broad specificity. in fact, it was a little surprising
to us that a molecule like dht with an a ring turned
through 180” would still serve as a substrate for vitamin

d-inducible vitamin d, hydroxylases. one might speculate based on these results that binding of vitamin d
and its analogs to side-chain hydroxylases
must be
primarily dependent on the structure and stereochemistry of the side chain and not so greatly on the structure
and stereochemistry of the triene and a ring. definition
of the limits of the specificity of these catabolic enzymes seems particularly topical with recent synthesis
of a large number of analogs of 1,25-(oh&d,, including calcipotriol (a”,“-24-oh-25.26,27-cyclopropyl
calcitriol) and 22-oxa- 1,25-(oh),d, for clinical use. ‘9.70
in this study we failed to synthesize peak h, the
peak observed previously in vivo and which appears to
have superior biologic activity (i.e., vdr binding) to
any dht metabolite so far tested. it thus appears that
peak h is not made in bone, although it is conceivable
that osteosarcoma cells do not accurately reflect ail the
metabolic activities of osteoblasts in vivo. however,
this does not seem likely since we have shown that
human osteosarcoma cells do reflect metabolic properties of freshly isolated cells from human bone explants.’
a more likely explanation is that peak h is not made
by bone, or even another vitamin d target cell. but by
a vitamin d-independent tissue. work in our laboratory
using a variety of cultured cell systems has failed
to reveal the cell type responsible for synthesis of
peak h.
one possible trivial explanation for the lack of synthesis of peak h from 25-oh-dht, in vitro but its
demonstrable synthesis from dht, in vivo has always
been that peak h may not contain a 25-hydroxyl and
thus may not be formed through 25-oh-dht,. experiments described in this paper using [ 10,19,-‘hi25ohdht, have dispelled this possibility. [ 10,19,-3h]dht,
was first converted to [io, l9-‘h]25-oh-dht, in a hepatoma cell system in vitro, then the pure radioactive
compound was injected into rats in vivo. results (see
figure 5) clearly show that [ 10, 19-3h] peak h is produced from [ 10, 19-3h]25-oh-dht, and therefore that
the structure of peak h probably involves no signficant
modification at the lo,19 carbons. furthermore,
the
experiment involving co-administration
of 25-oh-d,
with 110,19-~h]25-oh-dht~ suggests that the enzyme(s) responsible for peak h production must be
either vitamin d independent or not easily saturable.
contrast this with the formation of [10,19-3h]24,25(oh),dht, by side-chain hydroxylases
in figure 5,
which is totally abolished by the co-administration
of
excess 25oh-d,. we believe, therefore, that peak h
synthesis will prove to be a vitamin d-independent
pathway found in a tissue outside of bone, kidney, and
liver, since the hepatoma cell lines used to synthesize
[ 10,19-“hi25oh-dht,
fail to further metabolize it to
[ l0,19-“h] peak h. in conclusion, studies aimed at elucidation of the structure of peak h and its site of synthesis are continuing.
