katsuura, g., n. ibii and a. matsushita. activation of  xxxg352xxx  receptors induces elevation of plasma corticosterone in
rats. peptides 13(1) 203-205, 1992.--cholecystokinin octapeptide (cck-8) and  xxxd464xxx  (1 #g/kg) produced a pronounced
increment of plasma corticosterone levels at 30 min after intraperitoneal administration. the response to these peptides was
suppressed by pretreatment with a selective antagonist for  xxxg352xxx  receptors, (-)l-364,718, in a dose-related manner, but not
with an antagonist for  xxxg353xxx  receptors, (+)l-365,260. however, (-)l-364,718 itself had no effect on basal levels of plasma
corticosterone. these results indicate that peripheral administration of cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  stimulates the hypothalamo-pituitary
adrenal axis through the activation of  xxxg352xxx  receptors, but not  xxxg353xxx  receptors.

cholecystokinin octapeptide (cck-8) in the central nervous system has a wide range of central actions as neurotransmitter or neuromodulator to affect the activity of the central
nervous system (3,4,12-15,17,19). recently, cck receptors have
been classified into two subtypes, namely peripheral type (ccka) and brain type ( xxxg353xxx ), on the basis of ligand binding assay
and functional studies (1,2,6). after developing and characterizing selective nonpeptide antagonists for  xxxg352xxx  and  xxxg353xxx 
receptors (5), there is increasing evidence showing the involvement of a subtype of cck receptors in cck actions (l 8,20).
our previous results demonstrated that cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx 
activate the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis following intraperitoneal (ip) injection in rats (9,1 l). in the present study we
observed which subtype of cck receptors is involved in the
activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis following
the peripheral injection of cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  in rat using
selective nonpeptide antagonists for cck receptors.

logical saline solution. nonpeptide antagonists for cck receptors, (+)l-365,260 and (-)l-364,718 (synthesized in shionogi
res. labs.), were suspended with 50% arabic gum and injected
ip 30 min before the administration of peptides. the animals
were sacrificed by decapitation 30 rain after the injection of
peptides, and blood was collected in ice-cold test tubes containg
50/zl of heparin solution. plasma corticosterone was determined
by the fluoresence method as described previously (9). the data
were statistically analyzed by duncan's multiple range test after
one-way analysis of variance. each value represents the mean
_+ se of 7-9 rats.
results
ip injection of cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  in a dose of 1 #g/kg
induced pronounced elevation of plasma corticosterone levels
(fig. 1), which was consistent with our previous results (9,11).
a  xxxg352xxx  antagonist, (-)l-364,718, in doses over 1 #g/kg administered ip 30 min before the injection of cck-8, significantly
suppressed the elevation of plasma corticosterone levels in response to cck-8, f(9,70) = 16.86, p < 0.01 (fig. 1a). the
response to  xxxd464xxx  was also inhibited by (-)l-364,718 in
doses more than 10 #g/kg, f(9,70) = 6.68, p < 0.01 (fig. ib).
the effective dose of the antagonist was approximately 3 and
30 times greater than cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx , respectively, as
based on the molecular weight. however, a  xxxg353xxx  antagonist,

method
male wistar rats, weighing approximately 220 g, were housed
at a constant room temperarture of 25°c under a light/dark
cycle of 12:12 hours with lights turned on  xxxd2274xxx :00. rats were
allowed access to rat biscuits and water ad lib. cck-8 (peptide

discussion
our previous reports showed that cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  increased the plasma corticosterone levels following ip injection,
but the intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of the peptides

had no effect in rats (7,11). the response to the peptides was
completely diminished by vagotomy and hypophysectomy in
rats, and the peptides did not affect the secretion of  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) in in vitro study using hemipituitary
cultures (9,11). we have demonstrated that vagotomy reduces
the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone,
indicating the involvement of vagal neurons in activity of the
hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis (10). thus it is conceivable
that through cck receptors on peripheral nerves, such as vagus
nerve, cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  stimulate corticotropin-releasing
horome (crh) which, in turn, induces acth and then corticosterone secretion. while the presence of  xxxg352xxx  receptors on
the vagal neurons remains to be determined by direct binding
assay at this time, the present study clearly demonstrated the
involvement of  xxxg352xxx  receptors in the activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis, because the increment of
plasma corticosterone levels following the injection of the peptides was completely suppressed by the pretreatment of the selective antagonist for  xxxg352xxx  receptors, (-)l-364,718, but the
antagonist for  xxxg353xxx  receptors, (+)l-365,260, in the same dose
range of the  xxxg352xxx  antagonist, was ineffective at blocking the
response to cck and  xxxd464xxx . according to numerous studies
on subtypes of cck receptors,  xxxg352xxx  receptors have been
demonstrated to have high affinity with a sulfated form of cck8, but not nonsulfated cck-8, cck-4,  xxxd2873xxx  and gastrin,
and  xxxg353xxx  receptors have relatively high affinity with these
peptides as well as sulfated cck-8 (1,2,6). our previous studies
demonstrated that icv administration of sulfated cck-8, instead of ip injection, suppressed the increment of plasma corticosterone levels induced by  xxxg2417xxx , and
 xxxd2873xxx  suppressed the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary
adrenal axis (7,8). these findings indicate that  xxxg353xxx  receptors
are not involved in the activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary
adrenal axis. it has been reported that cck-8 induces the secretion ofbeta-endorphin through  xxxg352xxx  receptors in rats (16).
it is well known that the release of both acth and  xxxg1801xxx  is stimulated by a common hypothalamic factor, crh.
therefore, it seems likely that the activation of  xxxg352xxx  receptors
induces the secretion of crh, which stimulates the release of
acth and  xxxg1801xxx  from the pituitary. however, the
antagonist for  xxxg352xxx  receptors failed to influence the basal levels
of plasma corticosterone, suggesting that the blocking effect of
the antagonist is specific for cck action.
studies using antagonists for cck receptors might reveal the
physiological and pathophysiological relevance of cck in peripheral organs and the central nervous system.
