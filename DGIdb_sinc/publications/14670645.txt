abstract
there is substantial evidence that mammary cancer tissue contains all the enzymes responsible for the local biosynthesis of
estradiol (e2 ) from circulating precursors. two principal pathways are implicated in the final steps of e2 formation in breast
cancer tissue: the ‘aromatase pathway’ that transforms androgens into estrogens and the ‘sulfatase pathway’ that converts estrone
sulfate (e1 s) into estrone (e1 ) via  xxxg2222xxx . the final step is the conversion of weak e1 to potent biologically active e2
via reductive 17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity. it is also well established that steroid sulfotransferases, which
convert estrogens into their sulfates, are present in breast cancer tissues. one of the possible means of blocking e2 effects in
breast cancer is to use anti-estrogens, which act by binding to the  xxxg730xxx  (er). another option is to block e2 using
anti-enzymes (anti-sulfatase, anti-aromatase, or anti-17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17␤-hsd). various progestins (e.g.
promegestone, nomegestrol acetate, medrogestone, 17-deacetyl  xxxd2753xxx ,  xxxd1957xxx  and its 20-dihydro derivative), as
well as  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites, have been shown to inhibit  xxxg2222xxx  and 17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. some
progestins and  xxxd3372xxx  can also stimulate sulfotransferase activity. these various progestins may therefore provide a new option
for the treatment of breast cancer.

1. introduction
the “intracrine concept”, where a hormone has
a biological response in the same organ in which it
is produced, is entirely applicable to breast carcinoma tissue for two main reasons: (1) breast cancer
tissue accumulates extensive quantities of estrogens
(unconjugates and sulfoconjugates), particularly in
postmenopausal patients; (2) the enzyme systems for
the bioformation and metabolic transformation of
estrogens are present in high levels in this tissue. it
is clear that the biological responses to steroid hor∗

mones in their target tissue are subject to modulation
by a variety of enzymes. these enzymes may control
the access of steroids to their receptors by converting
them into forms with a higher affinity for the receptor
or by inactivating the corresponding steroid. one of
the possible ways of blocking the estradiol (e2 ) effect
in breast cancer is via anti-estrogens. another way
to block e2 is by using anti-enzymes (anti-sulfatase,
anti-aromatase, or anti-17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17␤-hsd) (type 1 against the enzymes that
are involved in e2 biosynthesis in breast cancer tissues)). at present, anti-aromatases are extensively
used in breast cancer treatment with positive benefits. however,  xxxg2222xxx  is quantitatively
the most important pathway in e2 bioformation in

breast cancer tissue. in this review, we summarise
the effect of various progestins on  xxxg2222xxx ,
17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and  xxxg2230xxx  in human breast cancer tissue.

2.  xxxg2222xxx  and its control in breast
cancer
2.1. the importance of  xxxg2222xxx  in
breast cancer
e2 is one of the most important factors in the
growth and evolution of hormone-dependent breast
tumors and it is now well accepted that breast tumors have the capacity to locally synthesize active e2 . two metabolic pathways are implicated
in this intra-tumoral biosynthesis: the “aromatase
pathway” that converts adrenal androgen precursors
(e.g. androstenedione) to estrone (e1 ) by aromatisation, followed by reduction of estrone to e2 via
17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17␤-hsd) type
1; and the “sulfatase pathway” that transforms the
precursor  xxxd2046xxx  (e1 s) to e1 via sulfatase in
adipose tissues, followed by 17␤-hsd type 1 reductive activity to e2 .
estrogen sulfates and sulfatases are important in
breast cancer due to the following reasons:
1.  xxxd2046xxx  is the most abundant circulating estrogen in the plasma of postmenopausal women.
the levels of this conjugate are 2–10 times higher
than those of unconjugated e1 and e2 [1–3].
2. as estrogen sulfates do not bind to estrogen receptors (er), estrogen-3-sulfates must be hydrolyzed
by sulfatases to elicit a biological response. e1 , after conversion to e2 , increases the amount of progesterone receptors (pr) and ps2 protein, as well
as estrogen-inducible protein  xxxg550xxx  [4–8] in
hormone-dependent breast cancer cells (mcf-7),
whereas estrogen-17-sulfates, which are not hydrolyzed by sulfatases, do not cause any biological
responses [6,7].
3. the incidence of breast cancer is higher after the
menopause when the ovaries have ceased to be
functional and the levels of e2 and  xxxd2046xxx 
are 7–11 times higher in breast tumour tissue than
in plasma [3].

4. the concentration of  xxxd2046xxx  in the tumor
is higher in postmenopausal than in premenopausal
breast cancer patients [3].
5. the tissue concentration of  xxxd2046xxx  is higher
in tumoral than in normal breast tissue [9].
6. sulfatase activity is very intense in malignant and
benign breast tumors compared with normal breast
tissue [9–12].
7. quantitative measurements indicate that levels of
 xxxg2222xxx  are 40–500 times higher than
those of aromatase in breast tumour tissue [3].
2.2. control of  xxxg2222xxx  in breast cancer
 xxxg2222xxx  activity is high in human hormone-dependent breast cancer cells (mcf-7, t- xxxd751xxx ).
in contrast, hormone-independent breast cancer cells
(mda-mb-231, mda-mb-468) show very low sulfatase activity in intact cells, but the activity is restored
when the cells are homogenized [13,14]. the sulfatase mrna is present in both the hormone-dependent
and hormone-independent breast cancer cells, and the
expression of this mrna correlates with sulfatase activity [15].
the data clearly indicate that sulfatase is present in
hormone-independent cells, but that it does not function in complete cells. why, in spite of the existence
of the enzyme, is very little  xxxd2046xxx  hydrolyzed
within these intact cells? the answer to this question
is not currently clear, but suggestions include the presence of repressive factor(s) or sequestration into an
inactive form for this kind of cell. more information
is needed to elucidate this mechanism.
as  xxxg2222xxx  is the other important means
of producing biologically active estrogens, blockade
of the sulfatase pathway constitutes a promising alternative for reducing the level of e2 . in recent years,
the potential inhibitory effects of a wide range of
compounds, including anti-estrogens, progestins,  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites, as well as steroidal and
non-steroidal compounds, have been explored.
2.2.1. inhibition by anti-estrogens
the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and its more potent metabolite,  xxxd91xxx , as well as ici
164,384, have been reported to inhibit sulfatase activity, probably by a non-competitive mechanism
[16–19]. chu et al. [20] found that, in the rat liver,

(e)- and (z)- xxxd91xxx  sulfamates are
also sulfatase inhibitors, with ki values of 35.9 and

2.2.2. inhibition by progestins
incubation of physiological concentrations (5 ×
10−9 m) of  xxxd2046xxx  with mcf-7 or t- xxxd751xxx 
human breast cancer cell lines showed that various progestins (nomegestrol acetate, promegestone,
progesterone, medrogestone (prothil® ), 17-deacetyl
 xxxd2753xxx  can provoke significant inhibition of  xxxg2222xxx  activity [13,21–24]. fig. 1 shows the
relative percentage of sulfatase inhibition by theseprogestins. recently, it was demonstrated that  xxxd1957xxx  ( xxxd1957xxx ® ) and its 20-dihydro derivatives
are potent inhibitors of  xxxg2222xxx  in mcf-7
and t- xxxd751xxx  breast cancer cells [25]. this is indicated
in fig. 2.
2.2.3. inhibition by  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites
 xxxd3372xxx  (org od14; active substance of  xxxd3372xxx ®
(2.5 mg)) is a 19-nortestosterone derivative with
tissue-specific estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties. it is used as monotherapy for the
treatment of climacteric symptoms and the prevention
of osteoporosis, without stimulating the endometrium.
 xxxd3372xxx , and its more active metabolites org 4094,
org 30,126 (3␣- and 3␤-hydroxy derivatives) and

org om38 (the 4-en isomer), are potent sulfatase inhibitors at low concentrations (5 × 10−7 m) in mcf-7
and t- xxxd751xxx  hormone-dependent breast cancer cells
[26].

line. cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 ◦ c with a physiological concentration (5 × 10−9 mol/l) of [3 h]-e1 s alone (control:
non-treated cells) or in the presence of dyd or dhd at the range
of concentrations from 5 × 10−9 mol/l to 5 × 10−5 mol/l. qualitative and quantitative analyses of e2 in the cell compartment were
performed by thin-layer chromatography and liquid scintillation
counting. results are expressed in fmol of e2 formed/mg dna

values (non-treated cells).

2.2.4. inhibition by steroidal compounds
estrone-3-o-sulfamate (emate) is a potent synthesized sulfatase inhibitor [27]; at a concentration
of 10−7 m,  xxxg2222xxx  activity in mcf-7
cells is 99% inhibited [28,29]. unfortunately, the
potent estrogenic activity of this compound precludes its use in clinical applications [30,31]. estrone phosphate and dhea-phosphate are also
potent inhibitors of estrogen sulfatase activity
[32].
in other studies, boivin et al. [33] and poirier and
boivin [34] attempted to develop sulfatase inhibitors
without residual estrogenic activity by synthesizing a series of e2 derivatives bearing an alkyl, a
phenyl, a benzyl substituted (or not), or an alkyan
amide side chain at position 17␣. these studies
showed that sulfatase inhibitors act by a reversible
mechanism and that the hydrophobic group at the
17␣ position increases the inhibitory activity, whilst
stearic factors contribute to the opposite effect. the
most potent inhibitor is a 17␣-benzyl substituted e2
derivative with an ic50 value of 22 nm. when these
17␣-substituents were added to the 3-o-sulfamate
estradiol structure, the combined inhibitory effect
was more potent, with an ic50 value of 0.15 nm
[35].
2.2.5. inhibition by non-steroidal compounds
an interesting new family of compounds has been
synthesized with a tricyclic coumarin sulfamate structure [36–40]. these non-steroidal sulfatase inhibitors
are active in vitro and in vivo, are non-estrogenic
and possess, in vitro, an ic50 value of approximately 1 nm. however, the most potent inhibitor in
vivo does not correspond to the best compound in
vitro.
2.2.6. inhibition of  xxxg2222xxx  activity by
estradiol (e2 )
recent studies have demonstrated a paradoxical effect of e2 in mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  breast cancer cells in
that it can block its own bioformation by inhibiting,
in a dose-dependent manner, the conversion of estrone
sulfate to e2 at concentrations of 5 × 10−10 m to 5 ×
10−5 m [41] (fig. 3). e2 is a potent inhibitor of estrone
sulfatase activity, with ic50 values of 1.84 × 10−9 m
and 8.77 × 10−10 m in t- xxxd751xxx  and mcf-7 cells, respectively.

and chetrite [41].

3. 17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the
breast
17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17␤-hsd),
a widely distributed enzyme in mammalian tissues,
is implicated in the inter-conversion of the inactive
17␤-keto to the active 17␤-hydroxy form of sex
steroid hormones (estrogens and androgens). however, some types of 17␤-hsd may metabolize other
substrates such as bile acids, alcohols,  xxxd2154xxx 
and retinols. 17␤-hsd belongs to a superfamily of
enzymes in which 11 different isoforms have been
recognised to date.
in normal breast tissue, oxidative 17␤-hsd activity
(e2 to e1 ) was found to be the preferential direction
and this activity was more intense during the secretory
phase of the menstrual cycle [42]; 17␤-hsd type 1
and 2 mrna are both expressed in glandular epithelium. in hme human mammary epithelial cell lines,
mrna for 17␤-hsd types 1, 2, and 4 was detected,
but only oxidative 17␤-hsd activity was present; it

j.r. pasqualini / maturitas 46s1 (2003) s45–s54

was suggested that this activity is due to 17␤-hsd
type 2 [43].
in breast tumours, in vivo and in vitro studies show
that the preferential conversion is the reduction of
e1 to e2 . 17␤-hsd type 1 is found in the cytoplasm
of malignant epithelial cells in breast tumours [44].
however, the direction of enzymatic activity (oxidative or reductive) in breast cancer is also greatly
dependent on the local, metabolic or experimental
conditions, including: the nature and concentration of
the cofactors (e.g. nadph or nadp) and substrate,
ph, and the subcellular localisation of enzymes. in
vitro studies using human tumour homogenates indicated that the predominant 17␤-hsd activity was
oxidative rather than reductive [45]. however, in vivo
studies following isotopic infusion of estrogens in
postmenopausal breast cancer patients have shown
that the reductive direction is greater than the oxidative
[44].
in hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines
(mcf-7, t- xxxd751xxx , r-27, zr-75-1), 17␤-hsd type 1
was found to be the predominant reductive isoform,
but types 2 and 4 isoforms with oxidative activities
(formation of e1 ) were also detected [44,46–48].
3.1. control of 17beta-hsd in the breast
in epithelial cells from normal breast, the progestin promegestone (r-5020) was shown to increase
17␤-hsd activity in the oxidative (e2 to e1 ) direc-

s49

tion; this stimulatory effect of progestins depends on
preliminary sensitization by estrogens [49,50].
progestins can induce 17␤-hsd type 1 activity,
with an increase in both the 1.3 kb mrna species and
the enzyme protein, in hormone-dependent t- xxxd751xxx 
breast cancer cells [44,48]. coldham and james [51]
found that the progestin  xxxd2554xxx 
(mpa) stimulated the reductive (e1 to e2 ) activity of
mcf-7 cells when phenol red was excluded from the
tissue culture media. the authors suggested that this
could be the way in which progestins increase cell
proliferation in vivo. on the other hand, couture et al.
[46] observed that when hormone-dependent zr-75-1
breast cancer cells were incubated with mpa, the
oxidative (e2 to e1 ) direction was predominant; this
effect seems to implicate the  xxxg183xxx . other
progestins, such as progesterone, levonorgestrel and
 xxxd2751xxx , increased both the oxidative and reductive 17␤-hsd activity in mcf-7 cells [52], whereas
promegestone (r-5020) had no significant effect on
the reductive activity of 17␤-hsd [53] but increased
the oxidative (e2 to e1 ) activity in t- xxxd751xxx  cells [54].
nomegestrol acetate had an inhibitory effect on the
17␤-hsd enzyme in t- xxxd751xxx  cells (35 and 81% inhibition at 5 × 10−7 m and 5 × 10−6 m, respectively),
but no significant effect was found in mcf-7 cells,
except at 5 × 10−5 m [22]. medrogestone (prothil® ),
a synthetic pregnane derivative of progesterone, significantly decreased the reductive 17␤-hsd type 1
activity in mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  breast cancer cells. the

inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent and
more intense, even at low concentrations, in the t- xxxd751xxx 
cell line than in the mcf-7 cells; the ic50 values,
which correspond to 50% inhibition of the conversion
of e1 to e2 , were 0.45 and 17.36 ␮m, respectively
[55]. comparative effects of various progestins:
promegestone,  xxxd1806xxx , medrogestone, nomegestrol
acetate, on the inhibitory effect of 17␤-hsd in t- xxxd751xxx 
cells are indicated in fig. 4. recently, it was shown
that  xxxd1957xxx  ( xxxd1957xxx ® ) and its 20-dihydro
derivatives can also inhibit the conversion of e1 to e2
in the t- xxxd751xxx  breast cancer cells (fig. 5).

were incubated for 24 h at 37 ◦ c with a physiological concentration
(5 × 10−9 mol/l) of [3 h]-e1 alone (control: non-treated cells) or in
the presence of dyd or dhd at the range of concentrations from
5 × 10−9 mol/l to 5 × 10−5 mol/l. qualitative and quantitative analyses of e2 in the cell compartment were performed by thin-layer
chromatography and liquid scintillation counting. results are expressed in fmol of e2 formed/mg dna from e1 . the data are the

cancer
as sulfoconjugates are not biologically active, control of their formation in breast cells represents an
important mechanism by which to modulate the biological action of e2 in this tissue. comparative studies

cells show significantly higher sulfotransferase levels
in the former [55].
4.1. effect of medrogestone and other progestins
medrogestone is a synthetic pregnane derivative
used in the treatment of pathological deficiency of
 xxxd3023xxx . this compound has secretory
activity in the estrogen-primed uterus, is thermogenic
and acts as an anti-estrogen and antigonadotropin. in
mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  breast cancer cells, medrogestone
had a bi-phasic effect on sulfotransferase activity: at
a low concentration (5 × 10−8 mol/l) it stimulated
the formation of estrogen sulfates in both cells lines,
whereas at a high concentration (5 × 10−5 mol/l)
sulfotransferase activity was not modified in mcf-7
cells or inhibited in t- xxxd751xxx  cells [23] (fig. 6).

fig. 8. effects of estradiol sulfotransferase (est) activity on the
proliferation of breast cancer cells. in normal breast cells, as a
consequence of est activity, proliferation is inhibited because
estradiol sulfate (e2 s) is biologically inactive. in contrast, in breast
cancer cells, hest activity is very low or non-existent as e2 s is
not formed and e2 can stimulate proliferation.

ii) hest inactivates e2 by e2s formation

in normal breast cells, a sulfotransferase (est) is
present that acts at nanomolar concentrations of e2 to
form estradiol sulfate (e2 s) and consequently blocks
the proliferative effect of e2 (e2 s is biologically inactive). however, in breast cancer cells, phenol sulfotransferase is active at micromolar concentrations of
e2 (figs. 7 and 8) and est is not present [56–58]. as
the progestin medrogestone stimulates est in breast

fig. 7. mechanism of sulfotransferase (st) activity in normal
and breast cancer cells. in normal breast cells, it is suggested
that hest acts at physiological (nanomolar) concentrations of
estradiol (e2 ) to form estradiol sulfate (e2 s), which is biologically
inactive. this enzyme is absent from breast cancer cells, where
phenol-st activity is seen only at micromolar (non-physiological)
concentrations.

iii) cell proliferation

cancer cells, and as it blocks the proliferation of t- xxxd751xxx 
cells, it has been suggested that the anti-proliferative
effect of medrogestone is correlated with the stimulatory effect of human  xxxg2230xxx  in
breast cancer cells (fig. 9). more information on the
proliferative effect on breast cancer cells of various
progestins or other molecules at nanomolar concentrations is needed to verify this hypothesis.

6. conclusions
one of the possible ways of blocking the effect of
e2 in breast cancer is by the use of anti-estrogens,
which act by binding to the  xxxg730xxx . more
than 15 years experience have shown that breast cancer patients treated with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen
(nolvadex) have a significantly reduced risk of recurrence and an increased overall survival. recently,
tests using a series of new anti-estrogens yielded very

encouraging clinical results. another way to block e2
is using anti-enzymes (anti-sulfatase, anti-aromatase
or anti-17␤-hsd) against enzymes that are involved
in e2 biosynthesis in breast cancer tissues. at present,
anti-aromatase is extensively used in breast cancer
treatment with positive benefits. however, estrone
sulfatase is quantitatively the most important pathway
in e2 bioformation in breast cancer tissue. interesting data have been obtained concerning the inhibitory activity of various progestins (promegestone,
nomegestrol acetate, medrogestone,  xxxd1957xxx 
and its 20-dihydro derivative), as well as  xxxd3372xxx  and
its metabolites, on  xxxg2222xxx , as well as on
17␤-hsd, which is involved in another pathway of
e2 formation in breast cancer cells.
recent data also show that some progestins
(promegestone, nomegestrol acetate,  xxxd1957xxx 
and medrogestone) and  xxxd3372xxx  can stimulate sulfotransferase activity in hormone-dependent breast
cancer cells. this is an important point in the physiopathology of this disease, as it is well known that
estrogen sulfates are biologically inactive.
