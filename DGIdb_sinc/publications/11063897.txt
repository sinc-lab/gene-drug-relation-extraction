abstract
objecti6e: to evaluate the effect of mirtazapine on the severity of hot flushes and bouts of perspiration in women.
method: in two women with depression a reduction in hot flushes was noticed by serendipity during treatment with
mirtazapine 15–30 mg/daily. on the basis of this observation clinical studies were extended with two non-depressed
and non-anxious women with hot flushes. both subjects were prescribed mirtazapine daily. results: four cases are
described as case reports. all subjects reported a practically complete disappearance of hot flushes and associated
perspiration, within the first week of treatment. conclusion: mirtazapine appears to have a substantial ameliorating
effect on hot flushes and perspiration bouts. it is postulated that the 5-ht2a blocking properties of mirtazapine is
accounted in the symptomatic relief of hot flushes. in addition it is hypothesized that the serotonergic system is
crucially involved in the pathogenesis of hot flushes and perspiration bouts. further evaluation in double-blind
placebo-controlled studies is encouraged. © 2000 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
hot flushes are commonly related to the decline
of estrogen production mostly as a result of
menopause [1]. around menopause 67% of
women [2] suffer from severe hot flushes which

are relieved by hormonal replacement therapy
(hrt) in the majority of patients. hrt has been
recognized to be first line of treatment against hot
flushes due to menopause but is contraindicated
in a number of clinical entities. apart from medical contraindications, it is the inconvenience of
monthly withdrawal bleedings and the small but
significant increased risk of breast cancer which
needs carefully attention. moreover, a low compliance for long-term estrogen therapy has been
reported in several studies [3].

lt is of note that hot flushes may also occur
long before or after the menopause which suggests
that apart from sex steroids there may be, yet
unknown factors, that are involved in its pathogenesis. by serendipity we found a clinically significant disappearance of severely symptomatic
hot flushes and associated bouts of perspiration in
two women treated with the antidepressant mirtazapine. in addition we successfully treated two
other women, who were not depressed but only
had hot flushes and bouts of perspiration, with
mirtazapine.

tiated with 20 mg of paroxetine daily, followed by
40
mg/day.
at
follow-up
paroxysmal
endocrine syndromes were excluded. after 2
months, due to sexual side effects paroxetine was
switched into mirtazapine 30 mg/day. after 1
week of treatment ms b reported a reduction of
frequency and intensity of hot flushes and
bouts of perspiration to neglectable proportions.
after 3 month of treatment by mirtazapine 30
mg/day, hot flushes and perspiration were not
recurring.

2.3. case 3
2. case reports

2.1. case 1
ms a, a 60-year-old dutch woman, suffered
from restlessness, anxiety, depressive feelings, hot
flushes and associated bouts of perspiration. she
was formerly successfully treated with hrt. after
a minor stroke she was advised to stop hrt.
however, cessation of estrogen treatment resulted
in the recurrence of hot flushes to an equal extent
as previously. ms a attended the outpatient department of psychiatry. she was diagnosed with
agitated major depression disorder (dsm-iv),
and mirtazapine 30 mg/day was prescribed. after
1 week, the patient reported that her agitation
was slightly decreased, she did not experience an
improvement in mood, but reported a significant
decrease in frequency and intensity of hot flushes,
and associated bouts of perspiration. the mirtazapine dosage was, therefore, increased to 60 mg
daily which resulted in an improvement in mood.
after 2 months of treatment there was a slight
recurrence of hot flushes and bouts of
perspiration.

2.2. case 2
ms b, a 39-year-old woman with premature
ovarian failure leading to early onset menopause,
was suffering from a moderate anxious depression. she was also complaining of hot flushes and
bouts of perspiration. she was diagnosed with
dysthymic disorder (dsm-iv). treatment was ini-

ms c, a 46-year-old woman in early menopause
suffered from at least 12 severe hot flushes and
bouts of perspiration commonly during nights.
malignancies and infectious diseases as well as
endocrine paroxysmal syndromes were excluded.
hrt was recommended but unfortunately contraindicated because of mammary cysts in the
past. after informed consent was obtained she
was treated with mirtazapine 15 mg/day. ms c
reported no more than two hot flushes within 1
week of treatment. after cessation of the drug the
attack frequency rose again to at least 12 times
per 24 h. on treatment she did not complain of
any side effect of the drug.

2.4. case 4
ms d, a 51-year-old woman suffered from at
least 15 severe hot flushes attacks a day. she also
had night sweats in her perimenopausal period.
after informed consent was obtained, she was
treated with mirtazapine 15 mg/day. she reported
a moderate reduction of hot flushes and sweating
to about 10 per day within 2 days of treatment.
within 2 days after increasing the dose to 30
mg/day the number of hot flushes was decreased to about six per day with a very low
intensity and night sweats were hardly recognized.
stopping the treatment caused a recurrence of the
flushes and sweating to pretreatment levels within
2 days. as side effect ms d reported some drowsiness only on the first day of treatment. after
increasing the dose this drowsiness was not seen
anymore.

3. discussion
the case reports we present here show different
women with regard to their mental status. all of
them had in common a complaint of intractable
attacks of hot flushes and bouts of profuse perspiration related to the onset of the menopause. two
women who suffered from a moderate depression
were intentionally treated with mirtazapine at the
outpatient department of psychiatry. these
women reported a strong decrease of hot flushes,
both in frequency and in intensity of the hot
flushes. therefore, two other women severely suffering from hot flushes were also treated with
mirtazapine. the effective treatment with mirtazapine with respect to these flushes and night sweats
in all four patients is a remarkable finding and
strongly suggests the efficacy of mirtazapine in
this respect.
the menopause is characterized by a strong
decrease of blood serum estrogen levels. it is
known that estrogens interact with several neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system
(for review see [4]). especially strong interactions
with the serotonergic (5-ht) system have been
described [5]. thus after estrogen withdrawal the
activity of the serotonergic system is decreased
and estrogen treatment has been found to augment the serotonergic activity resulting, among
others, in an upregulation of 5-ht2a receptors [5].
these 5-ht2a receptors are thought to underlie
the thermogenesis [6] and stimulation of these
receptors may cause a lowering of set-point temperature thereby activating some autonomic functions to cool down the body. indeed in humans it
was
found
that
administration
of
metachlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp), a 5-ht2c/2a
agonist causes palpitations and sweating [7].
blockade of 5-ht2a receptors might therefore
reduce the occurrence and/or intensity of hot
flushes [8]. mirtazapine possesses  xxxg1113xxx 
blocking properties and in the cases we report
here it strongly reduced the number and intensity
of hot flushes and night sweats. however, mirtazapine also binds to 5-ht2c, 5-ht3 and a2
adrenergic receptors [9,10]. the influence of the
5-ht2c and 5-ht3 receptors in the blockade of
hot flushes can as yet not completely be excluded.

167

an effect via blockade of the a2-adrenergic receptors by mirtazapine is not likely since activation
of these receptors by clonidine is known to reduce
hot flushes [11].
in conclusion, this report suggests that mirtazapine reduces the frequency and intensity of hot
flushes independent of the menopausal state.
however, in the patients we described, the measurement of frequency and intensity of hot flushes
at baseline and during treatment was not performed by objective instruments. double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies are needed to further
investigate the intriguing phenomenon of mirtazapine reducing hot flushes and associated perspiration. in these studies a placebo group has to be
included because placebo effects in this kind of
studies in which flushes are scored subjectively,
can not be excluded. in some studies placebo
treatments have shown to reduce the frequency of
flushes up to 20% [11,12].
