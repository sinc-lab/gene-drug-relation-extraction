effect of inhibition of  xxxg981xxx  by  xxxd444xxx  on central nervous system oxygen toxicity.  exposure of animals to o2 at increased partial pressures above 2.5 atmospheres absolute results in seizures. the endogenous intracellular antioxidant defense mechanisms are thought to play a protective role in mitigating such seizures. investigations were carried out to determine if inhibiting brain  xxxg981xxx  with  xxxd444xxx  would result in an alteration in time to seizures of rats exposed to high pressure o2. treatment of air-breathing rats with  xxxd444xxx  (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg i.v.) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease (p less than .001) in whole-brain  xxxg981xxx  activity without affecting the activities of the other components of the antioxidant defense mechanisms determined. this treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease (p less than .001) in time to seizure of rats exposed to four atmospheres absolute o2. conversely, treatment of rats with  xxxd2502xxx  (30 mg/kg i.v.), a nitrosourea compound related to  xxxd444xxx , failed to affect the activity of brain  xxxg981xxx  or any other component of the antioxidant defense mechanism determined, or did it influence the seizure time of rats exposed to four atmospheres absolute o2. these results suggest that  xxxg981xxx  is an integral component of the antioxidant defense mechanisms. inhibition of this enzyme results in an alteration in sensitivity of the organism to the toxic effects of o2.
