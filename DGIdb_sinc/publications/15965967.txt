pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the biological active form
of pyridoxine, is a cofactor for dopa-decarboxylase (ddc) enzyme. pyridoxine may augment the
conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery and therefore decrease availability of
levodopa to the brain. however, this effect can
be negated in the presence of a ddc inhibitor,
which potentiates plasma levodopa level. a single
nucleotide polymorphism at the nucleotide 1947
in the  xxxg487xxx  (comt) gene
encodes the high (comth) and low activity
(comtl) forms of the enzyme. in this study, we
examined the effect of the comtl allele on the
clinical response to pyridoxine in parkinson’s
disease (pd) patients. pd patients who were on
stable and optimized dose of levodopa were
included in this study. their mean motor and
activities of living score improved after high dose
pyridoxine (p ¼ 0.09, p ¼ 0.04), and worsened after
a washout period (p ¼ 0.005, p ¼ 0.001). using a
multivariate model, the presence of the comtl
allele predicted response to pyridoxine, with the
best outcome observed in comtl/l homozygotes.
our observational study suggests that the status
the functional comtl variant may be potentially
useful to select pd patients for high dose pyridoxine therapy.

[tan et al., 2003, 2004; lee et al., 2004]. levodopa in
combination with a dopa-decarboxylase (ddc) inhibitor
remains the cornerstone of therapy. however, medical treatment frequently has to be individualized [jankovic, 2000]. the
relationship between pyridoxine and plasma levodopa levels
has been investigated more than three decades ago [duvoisin
et al., 1969; klawans et al., 1971; yahr and duvoisin, 1972;
fahn, 1974; mars, 1974, 1975]. pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the
biological active form of pyridoxine, is a cofactor for ddc.
pyridoxine may augment the conversion of levodopa to
dopamine in the periphery and therefore decrease availability
of levodopa to the brain, with an increase in homovanillic acid
synthesis. but this effect can be negated in the presence of a
ddc inhibitor, which potentiates plasma levodopa level [fahn,
1974; mars, 1974, 1975] (fig. 1).
the enhancement of peripheral levodopa degradation by
pyridoxine and the action of ddc inhibitors can be variable
[mars, 1974, 1975]. it is not clear in an individual pd patient,
what pyridoxine and ddc inhibitor dose would affect motor
function. previous biochemical studies have focused on metabolic interaction of pyridoxine and levodopa with oral or
intravenous and intramuscular injections of 25–100 mg of
pyridoxine [duvoisin et al., 1969; klawans et al., 1971; yahr
and duvoisin, 1972; fahn, 1974; mars, 1974, 1975]. however
such route or dose of pyridoxine may not truly reflect
prescriptions in clinical practice.
a single nucleotide polymorphism at the nucleotide 1947 in
the  xxxg487xxx  (comt) gene encodes the
high (comth) and low activity (comtl) forms of the enzyme,
with a valine substitution for methionine at the 158/108 locus
in the peptide sequence. the comtl allele results in a heatlabile protein with a fourfold reduction in enzymatic activity
[mannisto and kaakkola, 1999]. this variant has been
demonstrated to influence dopamine regulation in the human
brain by their variable conversion of levodopa to 3-omethyldopa [akil et al., 2003]. it may be associated with risk
of pd [tan et al., 2000; wu et al., 2001].
in this study, we examined; (1) the effect of high dose
pyridoxine on the motor function during the ‘‘on’’ state in pd
patients, and (2) the effect of the comtl allele on the clinical
response to pyridoxine.
materials and methods
the trial was designed as a prospective, patient-controlled,
crossover study. consecutive pd patients were recruited and
evaluated by a movement disorder specialist in the outpatient
clinic. pd patients who were on stable and optimized dose of
levodopa (levodopa and ddc inhibitors) for at least 3 months

prior to study were included. the exclusion criteria were;
(1) patients who were taking  xxxd2716xxx  or other vitamin preparations or drugs that can interact with pyrixodine (such as
phenytoin, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, etc), (2) advanced
pd (hoehn & yahr stage 5), (3) patients who suffered from poor
nutrition, malabsorption, or had gut surgery, (4) patients with
debilitating and life threatening systematic illness, (5)
patients with allergy to any component of neuroforte1, and

interviewed regarding the food items consumed daily over a
4 weeks period. we calculated the amount of pyridoxine
consumed in milligrams by each subject over a course of
1 month based on the definitions and recommendations of the
usda national nutrient database for standard reference
(http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/data/sr17/wtrank/
wt_rank.html).

motor examination

blood was taken from study subjects as part of a larger study
on genetic susceptibility in pd. for comt, the polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) was carried out using primer pair of f-50 tcgtggacgccgtgattcagg-30 and r-50 -aggtctgacaacgggtcaggc-30 under conditions previously described
[wu et al., 2001; akil et al., 2003]. the pcr products were
digested with nlaiii and the comth (val-108) allele, and
comtl (met-108) allele were differentiated on gel electrophoresis.
a genetic polymorphism (4 bp deletion in exon1, of unknown
significance) of the ddc enzyme (fig. 1) was examined as a
control. genotyping was carried out using primers f-50 -gag
gga tgc tgc tca gta aa-30 , r-50 -atc cag aga gct
gga cgc-30 under previously described conditions [borglum
et al., 1999]. informed consent was taken from every study
subject for both the clinical and genetic analysis, and the
institution ethics committee approved the work.

all patients were examined during the ‘‘on’’ state for their
baseline motor function and the activities of daily living (adl)
using the unified pd rating scale. ‘‘on’’ was defined as the
time when both patients and investigator agreed that the
levodopa response was optimal, and this happened usually 2–
3 hours after a levodopa dose. they were instructed to take one
tablet of neuroforte1 (merck, germany) (each tablet contains
200 mg of pyridoxine, 100 mg thiamine, and 200 mcg of
cyanocobalamin) twice daily (at the same time as madopar1 or
sinemet1) for 4 weeks. this was equivalent to 400 mg
pyridoxine daily.
the patients were examined 4 weeks later during the ‘‘on’’
state, similar as examination at baseline. after a 2 weeks
washout period of pyridoxine, they were re-examined again
following similar procedures. the dosages of their levodopa
and other pd drugs were kept constant throughout.

genetic analysis of comt and ddc genes

dietary intake of pyridoxine

blinded examination/analysis

the patients were evaluated on their dietary habits to
estimate the amount of pyridoxine obtained from their daily
diet. the dietary habits of a list of 21 food items that contained
significant amounts of pyridoxine and frequently consumed
by our local population were investigated. subjects were

two groups of investigators conducted the clinical assessment and genetic analysis independently, and were blinded to
the clinical and genetic data available to each group. a third
group of investigators carried out the analysis of the clinical
and genetic data at the end of the study period.

high dose pyridoxine in parkinson’s disease

statistical analysis
two main outcome measures were evaluated; change in adl
and change in motor function score from baseline value.
manova was carried to find out the independent predictors
for the adl change and motor function change when the two
outcomes were considered simultaneously. manova works
by creating a composite measure of the two dependent
variables. the factors and covariates included in the manova
model were comt polymorphism, ddc polymorphism, dietary intake of pyridoxine, age, gender, stage and duration of
disease, and dose of levodopa.
results
out of 45 patients who participated, we found 6 protocol
violators (5 skipped the dose more than once, and 1 defaulted
follow-up). thirty-nine patients were finally analyzed comprising 24 men (61.5%) and 15 women (38.5%) with mean age of
69.9 (7.6), and mean duration of disease 5.9 years (sd  3.2).
the majority was of h&y stage 2–2.5 (61.5%) (range 2–4). the
mean total daily dose of levodopa was 421.5 mg (sd  226.2)
and the mean dietary intake of pyridoxine was 7.37 mg/week
(sd  2.78).
the mean baseline adl score was 13.4 (sd  4.8), which
decreased to 12.9 (sd  4.1) after the patients took pyridoxine
for 4 weeks (p ¼ 0.09) and increased to 13.7 (sd  4.7)
(p ¼ 0.005) after the washout period. the mean motor score
was 37.9 (sd  8.3), which improved to 36.7 (sd  8.2) after
pyridoxine for 4 weeks (p ¼ 0.04) and worsened to 38.7
(sd  8.5) after the washout period (p ¼ 0.001).
the comtl allele was present in 26/78 (33.3%) of patients,
with comtl/h heterozygotes accounting for 20/39 (51.3%)
followed by wild type 16/39 (41.0%) and comtl/l homozygotes
3/39 (7.7%). the multivariate pillai’s trace statistics from
manova showed that the comtl variant significantly
differed in terms of the composite measure of adl change
and motor function change (f(4,52) ¼ 2.943, p ¼ 0.029). the
comtl was significantly associated with motor function
improvement (f(2,26) ¼ 6.788, p ¼ 0.004) (table i). the dose
of levodopa weakly influenced adl change (f(1,26) ¼ 4.894,
p ¼ 0.036). ddc polymorphism, gender, age, stage of disease,
dietary intake of pyridoxine, and duration of pd were not
significant predictors (table i).
simple a priori contrast testing with t statistics revealed
that comtl/l homozygotes demonstrated a significantly
drop (from baseline) in motor function score than wild type

(t ¼ 3.628, p ¼ 0.001). the mean change in motor score (afterbefore neuroforte) was 8.082 (sd  6.0) for comtl/l homozygotes, 1.961 (sd  2.4) for comtl/h heterozygotes, and
þ0.338 (sd  3.1) for the wild type.
discussion
pyridoxine is a constituent of most multivitamin preparations available over the pharmacy’s counter. manufacturers’
information sheet instructs caution if levodopa is to be
prescribed.  xxxd2716xxx  preparations are frequently prescribed
for, or self-administered by pd patients.
we examined the effect of a widely available  xxxd2716xxx 
formulation that contains a high dose of  xxxd3049xxx  (200 mg/
capsule) in a select group of well nourished pd patients who
were on optimized levodopa regime. we demonstrated an
improvement of the mean motor score of 1.2 after 1 month of
pyridoxine and a deterioration of two points after the washout
period. similar findings were found in the adl score. in the
multivariate analysis, the presence of the functional comtl
allele but not the other studied variables predicted improvement in motor function. further analysis of the comt
genotypes demonstrated the greatest improvement in patients
who were comtl/l homozygotes. using a ddc polymorphism
of unknown function as a genetic control, such an association
was not demonstrated.
the probability of a false positive finding was low for the
following reasons; (1) the genetic and clinical analysis was
carried out by investigators independently, (2) the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria restricted confounding variables,
(3) the statistic (p ¼ 0.004) observed for the comt allele in the
multivariate model was robust, (4) the graded improvement
demonstrated in the comt genotypes, and (5) the lack of
association of the ddc polymorphism in the control arm.
importantly our findings make biological sense. in patients with
comtl allele, the conversion of levodopa to 3-0-methyldopa is
reduced, allowing more levodopa to be converted to dopamine.
high dose pyridoxine (a co-factor for brain decarboxylase)
facilitates the metabolism of levodopa to dopamine in the brain.
in the periphery, the presence of ddc inhibitors negates the
action of pyridoxine and more of the levodopa enters the brain
in those with the comtl allele (fig. 1). hence the overall effect
of taking high dose pyridoxine is greatly facilitated in the
brains of those with the comtl allele.
our observational study has some limitations. the sample
size did not allow us to conduct a more effective subset
comparison between those with different genotypes, though

the comtl/l homozygotes showed the greatest improvement,
followed by the comtl/h heterozygotes and those with the
wild type. however, based on a motor function change of eight
points (with sd of 3), our sample size has more than 95% power
to detect the observed difference between the comtl/l
homozygotes and wild type at a ¼ 0.01. similarly it has 80%
power to detect a difference of six points (sd of 3) between
comtl/h heterozygotes and wild type at a ¼ 0.01. in addition,
the multivariate analysis demonstrated robust association of
the comtl allele with clinical improvement. it is not clear
whether vitamins b1 and b12, minor constituents of neuroforte1 have any complimentary role in the outcome.
in conclusion, our study suggests that the status of a
functional comtl variant may be potentially useful to select
pd patients for high dose pyridoxine (at 400 mg/day) therapy.
further double blind controlled studies are warranted to
further investigate the utility of high dose pyridoxine as a
potential supplement to the pd therapeutic regime.
