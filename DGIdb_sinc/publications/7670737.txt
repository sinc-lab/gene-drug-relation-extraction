to a(-adrenoceptor blockade

1 the renal vascular responses of the rat isolated perfused kidney to the dopamine d,-receptor
agonists, dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx , were examined.
2 both kidneys were perfused in situ at constant flow rate (11 ml min-') with krebs-bicarbonate
solution at 37°c. the perfusion pressure was monitored and to enable vasodilator responses to be
measured, the resting perfusion pressure was raised by infusing noradrenaline (6 x 10-9 m).
3 dose-related vasodilator responses to bolus doses of dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  were obtained.
however, these were not antagonized by the d,-receptor antagonist, sch 23390, indicating that
di-receptors were not involved.
4 bolus doses of the a,-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx , caused similar dose-related vasodilator
responses indicating the possibility that a,-adrenoceptor blocking properties of dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  were responsible for the vasodilatation.
5 a-adrenoceptor blockade by dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  was confirmed by the parallel displacement of dose-response curves for the vasopressor responses to noradrenaline. pa2 values were determined by schild analysis for dopexamine,  xxxd2097xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx  antagonism of noradrenaline in the
presence of neuronal (cocaine, 10- m) and extraneuronal uptake blockade (metanephrine, 10-5 m). the
values were 6.23, 6.02 and 8.91, respectively. schild plot slopes of unity were obtained for dopexamine
and  xxxd2097xxx  indicating competitive antagonism. a slope of greater than unity for  xxxd3000xxx  may be
explained by the lack of equilibrium conditions associated with bolus doses of noradrenaline, the
responses of which are affected more by the high affinity antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx , than the two lower
affinity antagonists.
6 this study has demonstrated that renal vasodilator responses to the d,-receptor agonists, dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx , are due to a brief antagonism of the a-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction
induced by noradrenaline. this presumably masks any direct d,-receptor-mediated vasodilatation.

introduction

methods

the antihypertensive drug  xxxd2097xxx  was introduced as a
potent, selective renal vasodilator, acting predominantly
through stimulation of renal vascular d1-receptors. unlike
dopamine, it lacks a-adrenoceptor agonist activity (hahn et
al., 1982). similarly, dopexamine, used in the acute management of low cardiac output conditions, also produces renal
vasodilatation by selective stimulation of renal vascular d1receptors and lacks al-adrenoceptor agonist activity. in addition, the p2-adrenoceptor agonist activity of this drug promotes reduction of afterload due to vasodilatation and mild
positive inotropy (smith & o'connor 1988). in the present
study, the effects of both drugs were examined in the rat
isolated perfused kidney. this preparation has been used as a
model for d1-dopamine receptor-mediated vasodilatation.
there are several reports of dopamine and selective d,receptor agonists, including  xxxd2097xxx , producing falls in
perfusion pressure when the basal pressure is raised by
vasoconstrictors including prostaglandin f2. (imbs et al.,
1984; schmidt et al., 1987). however, this paper describes an
unexpected observation that although both drugs cause
vasodilatation of the rat renal vasculature, constricted with
noradrenaline, it is not due to di-receptor agonist activity
but to o1-adrenoceptor blockade. this property of the two
drugs is then quantified by determination of pa2 values and
compared to  xxxd3000xxx .

male wistar rats (300-350 g) were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (60 mg kg- ', i.p.). the abdomen was
opened and a polythene cannula was advanced retrogradely
along the abdominal aorta until the tip lay opposite the left
renal artery. the mesenteric artery was tied with a cotton
ligature and the aorta was ligated immediately below the
coeliac artery. both kidneys were then perfused, at a flow
rate of approximately 11 ml min- ', with carboxygenated
krebs-bicarbonate solution at 37°c by means of a watsonmarlow peristaltic pump (type 502s). the krebs-bicarbonate
solution had the following composition (mm): nacl 118.4,
nahco3 24.9, kcl 4.7, cacl2 1.9 (used as the dihydrate),
 xxxd2534xxx  1.15 (as the heptahydrate), kh2po4 1.15 and glucose
11.7.  xxxd228xxx  (1 mm) was added to reduce the oxidation of noradrenaline. although earlier studies have employed a more complex medium for examining renal function
in isolated perfused kidneys, this was not essential for the
present vascular studies. no deleterious effects were observed
upon the responses to noradrenaline over the time period of
each experiment.
the vena cava was cut between the left and right renal
veins to allow escape of perfusate. alterations in perfusion
pressure, arising from changes in renal vascular resistance,
were recorded on a lectromed polygraph (mt8 p. welwyn
garden city, hertfordshire) by means of a pressure transducer (bell and howell, type 4-327-l221) situated between
the perfusion cannula and the warming coil. a condon

statistics

manometer was also connected in series with the pressure
transducer to accommodate some degree of volume change
during drug responses.

student's t tests were used to test for significant differences
between geometric mean ed50 values, arithmetic mean maximum responses and pa2 values and to test the slopes of
schild plots for significant differences from unity. differences
were considered significant with p < 0.05. for comparison of
more than two means, tukey's multirange test (95% probability) was used.

construction of dose-response curves
in order to observe substantial vasodilator responses, the
renal vasculature was constricted by addition of 6 x i0- m
noradrenaline to the perfusion medium. when the elevated
perfusion pressure (213.2 ± 5.3 mmhg, n = 6) had stabilized
(about 15 min), non-cumulative dose-response curves to
vasodilator drugs were obtained by injection of increasing
bolus doses into the perfusion cannula. vasodilatation was
measured as the peak reduction in perfusion pressure at each
dose of drug, measured from the stable elevation of pressure
induced by noradrenaline. the ed50 value was calculated as
the dose producing 50% of maximum vasodilatation and the
geometric mean with 95% confidence limits was determined.

drugs and solutions
drugs were obtained from the following sources:- cocaine
hydrochloride (hillcross pharmaceuticals, burnley, lancashire, u.k.), dopexamine hydrochloride (fisons pharmaceuticals, loughborough, leicestershire, u.k.),  xxxd2097xxx  mesylate (skb, philadelphia p.a., u.s.a.), (± )metanephrine hydrochloride (sigma, poole, dorset, u.k. ),
(-)-noradrenaline bitartrate (sigma), pentobarbitone sodium
(sagatal) (rhone merieux, tallaght, dublin, ireland),
 xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride (pfizer, sandwich, kent, u.k.), (± propranolol hydrochloride (inderal) (ici pharmaceuticals,
macclesfield, cheshire, u.k.) and scti 23390 [(r)-( + )-8chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1h-3-benzazepine]
as the maleate (schering corporation, bloomfield, nj,
u.s.a.). stock solutions were prepared as follows:- dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  were made up in 0.9% saline containing 0.05% w/v sodium metabisulphite.  xxxd3000xxx , cocaine and
metanephrine were dissolved in twice distilled water, the
latter containing 0. 1% w/v sodium metabisulphite.
noradrenaline was dissolved in 0.01 m hcl. sch 23390 was
initially dissolved in a small quantity of 2 m hco and was
then made up to the required concentration by addition of
twice distilled water. stock solutions of dopexamine were
stored frozen in small aliquots for a maximum of 5 days.
stock solutions of sch 23390 were stored in the same way
for several weeks. solutions of  xxxd3000xxx  and noradrenaline
were prepared immediately prior to the experiment. working
drug concentrations were obtained by serial dilution of stock
solutions in krebs-bicarbonate solution.

calculation of pa2 values
pa2 values for the antagonism of vasoconstrictor responses
to noradrenaline by dopexamine,  xxxd2097xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx 
were calculated (arunlakshana & schild, 1959). following an
initial non-cumulative dose-response curve to increasing
bolus doses of noradrenaline in the absence of antagonist, a
30min period of antagonist infusion was allowed before a
second dose-response curve was constructed in its presence.
responses were measured as the increase in perfusion pressure. to compensate for time-dependent changes in tissue
sensitivity to noradrenaline between the first and second
dose-response curves, correction factors derived from timematched control experiments in the absence of antagonist
were applied to the first curve. at each dose of
noradrenaline, the response ratio (curve 2/curve 1) was
calculated for the control experiments. mean correction
ratios (n > 4) were then multiplied by the corresponding
response values of the initial curve of the 'test' experiments.
dose-response curves were then plotted as a percentage of
the maximum response and the ed50 determined as the dose
producing 50% of the maximum response. dose-ratios were
calculated by division of individual ed50 values obtained in
the presence of antagonist (curve 2) by the corresponding
values in the absence of antagonist (curve 1). geometric
mean ed50 values and their 95% confidence limits were
calculated. values for pa2 were obtained by plotting log
(dose ratio -1) on the ordinate scale against log antagonist
concentration on the abscissa scale; the intercept of the
regression line on the abscissa scale giving the pa2 value.

results

vasodilator responses to dopexamine andfenoldopam
responses to dopexamine were examined in the presence of

p-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol (10-6 m). both
 xxxd2097xxx  and dopexamine caused dose-related falls in perfusion pressure (figure 1). the maximum response to dopexamine was consistently greater than that of  xxxd2097xxx

(figure 2). this was shown by administration of a maximum
dose of one agonist following completion of the doseresponse curve to the other, as illustrated in figure 1.

effect of sch 23390 on responses to dopexamine and
 xxxd2097xxx 
the dose-response curves for vasodilatation in the
noradrenaline-constricted kidney preparation in response to
bolus doses of dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  were not
significantly dextrally displaced in the presence of the competitive di-receptor antagonist, sch 23390 (10-6 m) (figure
3). the basal noradrenaline-induced perfused pressure prior
to administration of the dopamine agonist was not affected
by the presence of sch 23390. the mean values prior to
dopexamine of 205.5 ± 5.1 and 216.3 ± 4.7 mmhg (n = 4) in
the absence and presence of sch 23390, respectively, were
not significantly different (p>0.05).

effect of  xxxd3000xxx 
as with dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx , bolus doses of the
ax-adrenoceptor-selective competitive antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx 
(cambridge et al., 1977), caused dose-related falls in perfusion pressure (figure 2). although the ed50 for  xxxd3000xxx 
(44.8(15.2-132.0)ng) was significantly lower than for dopexamine (3.8(2.6-5.3)flg) and  xxxd2097xxx  (5.9(4.6-9.7)pg), the
maximum decreases in perfusion pressure caused by  xxxd2097xxx  (122.5 ± 6.3 mmhg) and dopexamine (127.1 ± 5.3
mmhg) were significantly greater than the maximum for
 xxxd3000xxx  (94.0 ± 2.6 mmhg).

which were not significantly different from unity (table 1).
the pa2 value obtained for dopexamine was (6.23 ± 0.11)
and a similar value was determined for  xxxd2097xxx 
(6.02 ± 0.21). the antagonism of noradrenaline responses by
 xxxd3000xxx  yielded a pa2 of 8.91 ± 0.58, although the slope of
the schild regression (1.28 ± 0.16) was significantly greater
than unity (p< 0.001) (figure 6c).
in the absence of uptake block, the slope of the schild plot
for  xxxd2097xxx  (0.35 ± 0.12, figure 6e) was significantly less
than unity (p<0.01). the pa2 value (8.36 ± 0.21) was consequently higher than the corresponding value in the presence
of uptake blockade. in contrast, the slope of the schild plot
for dopexamine (figure 6d) remained close to unity
(1.08 ± 0.20), resulting in a pa2 value which was close to that
obtained in the presence of uptake block (table 1).

discussion
in view of the established di-receptor agonist activities of
 xxxd2097xxx  (hahn et al., 1982) and dopexamine (brown et
al., 1985), it was assumed that their vasodilator responses in
the noradrenaline-constricted isolated perfused kidney were

concentration-response curves for noradrenaline were progressively displaced to the right by dopexamine (figure 4),
 xxxd2097xxx  (figure 5) and  xxxd3000xxx . pa2 values for this
antagonism by dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  were determined
either in the presence or absence of neuronal and extraneuronal uptake block by cocaine (10-5 m) and metanephrine (10-5 m), respectively. the pa2 for  xxxd3000xxx  was
obtained in the presence of neuronal and extraneuronal
uptake block but not in their absence.
in the presence of uptake block, the schild plots for the
antagonism of the vasoconstrictor responses of noradrenaline
by dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  (figure 6a and b) had slopes

the result of dopamine d,- receptor stimulation. furthermore, this isolated organ is known to exhibit vasodilator
responses to dopamine (imbs et al., 1984; schmidt et al.,
1987). however, the inability of the potent, selective d,receptor antagonist, sch 23390 (hilditch et al., 1984) to
antagonize the vasodilator responses to either  xxxd2097xxx  or
dopexamine at a concentration of 10-6 m, suggested that
di-receptors were not involved. this concentration is known
to be sufficient to antagonize d1-receptor-mediated responses
in this tissue (schmidt et al., 1987) and the splenic artery
(hilditch & drew, 1985) where pa2 values of about 10 were
obtained. the possibility was considered that the responses
were a result of antagonism of the cx-adrenoceptor-mediated
noradrenaline pre-constriction rather than d1-receptormediated relaxation. the similarity of the  xxxd2097xxx  and
dopexamine responses to those produced by the competitive
al-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  (cambridge et al., 1977)
in the same preparation, supported this suggestion. this,
together with reports in the literature demonstrating
antagonism by  xxxd2097xxx  of the a,-adrenoceptor-mediated
responses of noradrenaline in the rat (ohlstein et al., 1985),
dog and rabbit (nakamura et al., 1986) isolated blood
vessels, prompted efforts to confirm and quantify the axadrenoceptor antagonist properties of  xxxd2097xxx  and

dopexamine in the noradrenaline-constricted rat isolated perfused kidney.
both  xxxd2097xxx  and dopexamine caused concentrationrelated displacement of the noradrenaline dose-response
curves, indicating a,-adrenoceptor blockade. since dopexamine has been shown to have uptake blocking activity
(mitchell et al., 1987) which may have influenced the
measurement of antagonism, pa2 values for dopexamine and
 xxxd2097xxx  were determined both in the presence and
absence of uptake blockade.

effect of uptake block on the antagonism of
noradrenaline responses by  xxxd2097xxx 
since the slope of the schild plot for  xxxd2097xxx  was not
significantly different from unity in the presence of uptake
block, but was significantly less than unity in the absence of
uptake block, it seems likely that the low slope obtained
under the latter conditions was due to the operation of an
agonist uptake mechanism rather than to a lack of competitive antagonism (blinks, 1967; furchgott, 1967; langer &
trendelenburg, 1969). the low slope can be explained in
terms of a model proposed by langer and trendelenberg
(1969) which ascribed three regions to the uptake process. in

region i, a fixed proportion of the agonist is removed from
the vicinity of the receptor. as the agonist concentration is
increased (for example, to overcome the effect of a competitive antagonist), an increasing proportion of the agonist
reaches the receptor due to progressive saturation of the
uptake mechanism (region ii) until saturation of uptake is
virtually complete and the concentration of agonist at the
receptor approaches that in the surrounding medium (region
iii). as dose-response curves to the agonist are shifted progressively to the right by increases in antagonist concentration, they pass from region i, through region ii, in which
the increasing proportion of the agonist reaching the receptor
has a potentiating effect causing steepening, and sinistral
(leftwards) displacement of the ecm. thus, the dose-ratios
are reduced and the slope of the schild plot is reduced.

effects of noradrenaline in the rat isolated perfused kidney by dopexamine,  xxxd2097xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx . experiments were performed either
in the presence of uptake blockade by cocaine (10-5 m) and
metanephrine (10-s m) (dopexamine a,  xxxd2097xxx  b,  xxxd3000xxx  c) or
in the absence of uptake blockade (dopexamine d,  xxxd2097xxx  e).
points are mean values ± s.e.mean (n > 4).

renal vasodilatation by dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx 

figure 6e shows that in the absence of uptake block, no
increase in dose-ratio was observed as the concentration of
 xxxd2097xxx  was increased from 10-6 m to 10' m. only
when the concentration of  xxxd2097xxx  was raised to
3 x 10-0m did the dose-ratio appreciate. according to the
langer & trendelenberg (1969) model, 3 x 10-6 m and
10-0m  xxxd2097xxx  may have shifted the noradrenaline doseresponse curves into region ii, where an increasing proportion of the agonist reaches the receptor due to progressive
saturation of neuronal uptake. the resulting potentiation of
the noradrenaline responses was sufficient to nullify the effect
of increasing the  xxxd2097xxx  concentration such that the
dose-response curves were shifted no further rightwards than
in the presence of 10-6 m  xxxd2097xxx  (figure 5a). this
argument assumes that although higher added concentrations
of noradrenaline were not in fact used in the presence of
3 x 10-6 and 10-0m  xxxd2097xxx , there may be a higher
concentration at the receptor. when the antagonist concentration was increased to 3 x 10-5 m, the noradrenaline doseresponse curves were shifted into region iii in which saturation of uptake is virtually complete, and with no further
opposition to the action of  xxxd2097xxx  possible, the
noradrenaline dose-response curve was driven further rightwards with. a consequent increase in ed50 and dose-ratio.
due to the magnitude of this final dose-ratio, the slope of the
schild plot was not drastically reduced by the failure of
3 x 10-6 m and 10-5 m  xxxd2097xxx  to increase the dose-ratio
appreciably from its value of 10-6 m. rather, the major cause
of the reduced slope was the large magnitude of the doseratios associated with the 10-6 10-5 m concentrations of the
antagonist. this, in turn, was the result of an effect
associated with the correction (for time-dependent changes in
sensitivity) of the pre-antagonist dose-response curve.
figure 7 shows noradrenaline dose-response curves from
time-matched control experiments. the curves were constructed before and after a 'sham' incubation period equivalent to
the contact time with  xxxd2097xxx . contrary to expectations,
in the absence of uptake block (figure 7a), curve 2 was
sinistrally displaced; if anything, a dextral displacement was
anticipated due to the attenuation of tissue sensitivity with
repeated exposure to noradrenaline. in the presence of
uptake block, the two curves were virtually superimposed
(figure 7b), suggesting that the operation of the uptake
mechanism was, paradoxically, responsible for potentiation
of the responses to noradrenaline on repeated exposure.
one possible explanation for this is that supramaximal
doses of noradrenaline required to confirm the maximum
response may have persisted in the uptake mechanism during
washout and resulted in potentiation of responses in the
second curve. this is supported by the fact that the ed50 for
the second curve constructed in the absence of uptake block
(63 (37-109)ng) was not significantly different from the edo
for the corresponding curve obtained in the presence of
uptake block (56 (40-77)ng). the pre-antagonist curve was
therefore displaced to the left by the correction procedure
(figure 8a) and this exaggerated the dose-ratios to a proportionally greater extent at lower concentrations of  xxxd2097xxx . this effect caused the marked reduction of the slope
of the schild plot in the absence of uptake block compared

figure 7 dose-response curves for vasoconstrictor responses to
noradrenaline from time-matched control experiments conducted in
the absence of antagonist and obtained in the absence (a) or presence
(b) of uptake block. the initial dose-response curve (0) was followed after a sham-incubation without antagonist by a second curve
(0). points are the mean responses expressed as a percentage of the
maximum response (± s.e.mean, n > 4).

with that obtained in the presence of uptake block. this
indicates the importance of inhibiting the uptake mechanism
when using noradrenaline as the agonist.

effect of uptake block on antagonism of noradrenaline
responses by dopexamine
unlike  xxxd2097xxx , dopexamine progressively shifted the
noradrenaline dose-response curves rightwards in a
concentration-dependent manner in the absence as well as in
the presence of uptake block (figure 4a). this was reflected
in the slopes of the schild plots which were not significantly
different from unity in either case. the most obvious reason
for dopexamine producing a unity schild plot slope in the
absence of uptake block is that it is a more potent inhibitor
of neuronal uptake than cocaine (mitchell et al., 1987;
nedergaard, 1988; 1989). inhibition of uptake by dopexamine would potentiate dose-response curves to
noradrenaline and thus lessen the degree of antagonism.
according to the langer & trendelenburg model (1969),
there would be no potentiation of the dose-response curve
generated in the absence of the antagonist, and dose-ratios
would consequently be reduced to a greater extent at low
concentrations of dopexamine than at high concentrations.
this would result in a steepening of the schild plot to
maintain unity slope in the absence of cocaine.

effect of  xxxd3000xxx 

on

the

responses to

noradrenaline

in the presence of uptake blockade, the antagonism of the
vasoconstrictor responses of noradrenaline by  xxxd3000xxx 
resulted in a schild plot having a slope which was
significantly greater than unity. schild plot slopes exceeding
unity can result from lack of equilibrium conditions for the
antagonist at the time the response is measured, or from loss
of free drug from the external solution (furchgott, 1972). in
addition, a saturable removal mechanism for the antagonist
can also give rise to high slopes (kenakin, 1987). the latter
cause can be discounted since  xxxd3000xxx  is not a substrate for
neuronal or extraneuronal uptake which were, in any case,
blocked with cocaine and metanephrine respectively. it is
possible that the time allowed for equilibration of  xxxd3000xxx 
with the receptor (30 min) was not sufficient. since the rate of
onset of antagonist action is concentration-dependent, the
effect of low concentrations of  xxxd3000xxx  with this length of
equilibration may be underestimated, resulting in a steepening of the slope of the schild plot (kenakin, 1987). indeed, in
the present case, a disproportionately low dose-ratio value at
the lowest concentration of  xxxd3000xxx  was the main cause of
the high slope obtained. another possible explanation for the
high slope of the schild plot for  xxxd3000xxx  is that bolus
injections of noradrenaline, being short-lived in the system,
do not allow sufficient time for the drug to reach equilibrium.

s.w. martin & k.j. broadley

as in the present study, blue & clarke (1992) found that
antagonism by  xxxd3000xxx  of the vasoconstrictor responses produced by bolus doses of noradrenaline in the rat perfused
kidney apparently deviated from competitive inhibition; the
slope of the schild plot obtained was significantly greater
than unity (1.33). on the other hand, when noradrenaline
was administered by infusion, the schild plot for antagonism
of the responses by  xxxd3000xxx  was not significantly different
from unity, indicating competitive kinetics. these authors
proposed that lack of equilibrium conditions for the agonist,
due to the inherent transience of bolus doses in a perfused
system, can lead to a progressive overestimation of the doseratio of the antagonist and thus to the slope of the schild
plot exceeding unity when high affinity antagonists such as
 xxxd3000xxx  are employed. in the present study, the slope of the
schild plot for the antagonism of noradrenaline by  xxxd3000xxx 
was greater than unity whereas both  xxxd2097xxx  and dopexamine (in the presence of uptake block) produced slopes
which were not significantly different from unity. the
hypothesis of blue & clarke (1992) can account for this
difference in that  xxxd2097xxx  and dopexamine are weaker
antagonists (pa2 = 6.2 and 6.0 respectively, see above) than
 xxxd3000xxx , and as such their relatively rapid onset/offset rates
would allow both noradrenaline and antagonist (dopexamine
or  xxxd2097xxx ) to attain equilibrium with the a,-

renal vasodilatation by dopexamine and  xxxd2097xxx  355

adrenoceptor in spite of the rapid removal of injected
noradrenaline from the perfused kidney.
the finding that the two di-receptor agonists, dopexamine
and  xxxd2097xxx , also possess antagonist activity at a,adrenoceptors confirmed previous observations for  xxxd2097xxx  by ohlstein et al. (1985). this property would probably contribute to the antihypertensive activity of  xxxd2097xxx  (ventura et al., 1984). al-adrenoceptor blockade by
dopexamine would also complement its agonist activity at
di-dopamine receptors and p2-adrenoceptors by reducing
sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone to the renal vasculature and
improving renal blood flow. the reduced vascular tone
would also exert favourable effects on cardiac pre- and afterload to improve cardiac performance in low output states.
the fact that the vasodilator activities observed in the-present study could be attributed to al-adrenoceptor blockade
was dependent upon the use of noradrenaline to maintain
vascular tone. it does not imply that these compounds cannot exert vasodilatation via di-receptors when an alternative
vasoconstrictor is employed (schmidt et al., 1987).
