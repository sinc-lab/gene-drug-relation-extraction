abstract: although the qualitative nucleocytoplasmic transport of nuclear hormone receptors (nhrs)
has been studied, there is little documentation of the cellular kinetics of this transport. here,
translocation studies using the human  xxxg183xxx  (har) and the human  xxxg1601xxx 
(hgr) were performed to aid in identifying the mechanism by which anabolic-androgenic steroids
(aas) were activating har and potentially interacting with hgr and how glucocorticoid ligands were
interacting with the hgr and har. the real-time analysis of egfp-labeled har and hgr ligandinduced cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation was performed using fluorescence microscopy to better
understand the action of these nhrs in a physiologically relevant cell-based model. after transient
transfection, the har and hgr individually translocate as expected (i.e., transport is ligand-induced
and dose-dependent) in this model biological system. testosterone (test) had the fastest
translocation rate for the har of 0.0525 min-1. the other endogenous steroids, androstenedione
(ane) and dihydrotestosterone (dht), had considerably lower har transport rates. the rates of har
transport for the exogenous steroids methyltrienelone (met), nandrolone (nan), and  xxxd2806xxx 
(oxa) are lower than that of testosterone and similar to those of the endogenous steroids ane and
dht. the hgr transport rates for cortisol (cor) and dexamethasone (dex) are also presented.
the synthetic gc, dex, had a more rapid translocation rate (0.1599 min-1) at the highest dose of
100 nm compared to the endogenous gc cor (0.0431 min-1). the data obtained agrees with the
existing qualitative data and adds an important ligand-dependent kinetic component to har and hgr
transport. these kinetic data can aid our understanding of nhr action and interaction with other
regulatory proteins, and can be useful in the development of new therapies.

introduction
the human  xxxg183xxx  (har) and the human
 xxxg1601xxx  (hgr) are nuclear  xxxg1603xxx 
(nhr) transcription factors that shuttle from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus upon ligand binding. once in the nucleus,
they bind to hormone response elements (hres) in the

promoter region of their target genes and activate or repress
transcription. this transport to the nucleus is a necessary
component of ligand-mediated nhr action; har and hgr
have been extensively studied, and their nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling is documented.1-16 however, there are few reports
of the cellular kinetics of nhr transport.17

the exact mechanism of action (moa) of anabolicandrogenicsteroids(aas)isstillnotcompletelyunderstood.18,19
studies suggest the moa of aas may differ between steroid
compounds because of variation in the structure of the steroid
molecule and its affinity to the har or the hgr.18 synthetic
steroids, which are commonly abused for their muscle
building effects, have been developed via the modification
of testosterone in an attempt to enhance pharmacologic
properties of the steroids. however, the reasons for the
variation of resulting pharmacologic activity are unclear.
these synthetic aas do activate the har, but there has been
no assessment of the kinetics and rate of transport variation
between the compounds. in addition, the competitive antagonism of hgr by aas (complementary to their agonist
activity at har) has been reported,20-22 but it is unclear if
the har ligands are causing hgr transport.
this study determines the rate of import of har and hgr
individually into the nucleus of living cells in real time with
representative ligands specific to each receptor. the ligands
included in this study are representative endogenous steroids
and synthetic steroids. the real time imaging to determine
dynamic effects which occur after ligand binding may aid

length har or hgr into the expression plasmid pegfp-c1
(clontech, mountain view, ca).
cell culture and transient transfection. cos-7 cells
were maintained in rpmi-1640 media with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 µg/ml penicillin, streptomycin, and  xxxd164xxx . the cells were kept in an incubator at 37 °c and
5% co2. cos-7 cells were transiently transfected using
lipofectamine 2000 cd according to optimized manufacturer’s instructions. a 1:5 ratio of dna:lipofectamine in
400 µl of plain rpmi-1640 was used for transfection in
live cell chambers (lab-tek chamber slide system, 2 ml,
nalge nunc international, naperville, il) seeded with
cos-7 cells at 90% confluency. for transport assays, 1 µg
of egfp-labeled nhr was used.
transport studies. approximately 24 h after transfection,
media on the cos-7 cells was changed to phenol red-free
rpmi-1640 containing 10% charcoal stripped fbs. after
an hour, the cells were treated with steroid (concentration
of 1 nm, 10 nm, 50 nm, or 100 nm or ethanol vehicle).
these four concentrations of steroids range from very low
to supraphysiological and encompassed normal physiological
levels. translocation of receptors was viewed with fluorescence microscopy; images were taken at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20,
30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min for individual experiments.
time points were chosen based on previous studies and the
observation that import reaches steady state (or plateaus) after
2 h.3,17 the fastest import rates occur during the first 30 min
after ligand induction.17
microscopy. an olympus ix701f inverted fluorescence
microscope (scientific instrument company, aurora, co)
with high-quantity narrow band gfp filter (excitation
hq480/20 nm, emission hq510/20 nm, with beam splitter
q4951p) was used. cells were photographed at a magnification of 40× using an f-view monochrome ccd camera. to
minimize photobleaching of the egfp chromophores, cells

were imaged using neutral density filters at short (500 ms)
exposure times. an air stream incubator (nevtek asi 400,
burnsville, va) with temperature control was used to
maintain the microscope stage at 37 °c.
quantitation of receptor translocation data analysis
and statistics. fluorescence microscopy was used to study
and quantify the amount of protein present in a cellular
compartment as done previously.25-29 fluorescence intensity
of a particular compartment relates to the amount of protein
present in that compartment; therefore, quantitation of protein
in the nucleus and cytoplasm was carried out by measuring
the fluorescence intensity of egfp tagged to the protein
construct as previously described.26,29,30 all the images were
analyzed using analysis software (soft imaging system,
lakewood, co), which calculates values for total cell
intensity and nucleus intensity. to obtain percent intensity
in nucleus (which indicated the amount of protein in the
nucleus compared to cytosol), nucleus intensity was divided
by total cell intensity and multiplied by 100.
curve fitting and statistical analysis. for individual
translocation studies all doses of steroids were repeated in
triplicate (n ) 3) and 10 cells representative of the whole
population were analyzed in each experiment (n ) 30 cells

results
har transport. after transient transfection of egfphar into cos-7 cells, the majority of the receptor is located

the cytoplasm of the cells. figure 1 shows cos-7 cells
treated with vehicle; over time, there is no change in the
localization of egfp-har. at all time points the approximate
percent intensity in the nucleus is 20%. the initial 20%
intensity in the nucleus is likely due to the use of normal
fluorescence microscopy, which allows for the recording and
assessment of all gfp signals generated from each cell.
figure 2 shows cos-7 cells treated with four different
concentrations of test at three time points. at time 0 for
all treatment groups there is approximately 20% of cellular
intensity in the nucleus. at 45 min, more of the receptor
has shuttled from the cytosol to the nucleus in a dosedependent manner; there is a higher percentage of nuclear
intensity at higher doses. at 240 min, the maximal amount
of receptor per dose has been shuttled into the nucleus. the
cells for other aas studies are similar (data not shown).
several aas were chosen for analysis in these studies. these
aas were chosen and used because they have varying affinities
for the har and varying reported potencies.19,31-34 the selected
aas are also representative of the major structural modifications
made to aas: varied conjugation of a, b, and c rings in the
steroid and varying functional groups on carbon 17. in addition,
the har antagonist flu was assessed.
figure 3 shows the data for har ligand transport of test,
ane, dht, epi, met, nan, oxa, and flu in graphical
form along with vehicle. the dose-dependent rate of transport
is evident by the varying steepness of the fitted curves. the
rates, as determined from the curve fit, and the rrvs are
summarized in table 1. test had the highest rates followed
by met, oxa, nan, dht, ane, and epi. this trend,
although dose-dependent, was not expected based on affinity;
the results were not affinity-dependent. flu showed little
transport except at the highest dose. for test, ane, met,
and oxa, the highest rate was seen at the 50 nm dose, which
is the dose closest to physiological levels of endogenous aas.
figure 4a shows cos-7 cells treated with 100 nm cor
at three time points. at all time points, there is no nuclear
translocation of egfp-har observed. the cells treated with
dex and e2 are similar, as expected (no translocation; data
not shown). figure 4b shows the har transport data of cor;
the har transport data for dex and e2 look similar (data
not shown). there was no change in receptor localization
due to these ligands; the best fit lines and rates are similar
to vehicle. the rates determined from the curve fit and the
rate relative to vehicle for cor, dex, and e2 are summarized in table 2. although these results were predicted,

hgr transport. as with egfp-har, after transient
transfection of egfp-hgr into cos-7 cells the majority of
the receptor is located the cytoplasm. figure 5 shows cos-7
cells transfected with hgr and treated with vehicle. over
time and similar to vehicle treated egfp-har, there is no

the approximate percent intensity in the nucleus is 20%.
figure 6 shows cos-7 cells transfected with hgr and

to the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. at 240 min, the
maximal amount of receptor per dose has been shuttled into

expected (data not shown).

varying structures and affinity for the hgr.35,36 as with har
and aas, the dose-dependent rate of transport is evident by
the varying steepness of the fitted curve. the rates of cor and
dex mediated hgr transport, as determined from the curve
fit, and the rate relative to vehicle are summarized in table 3.
cor has higher rates than dex at 1 nm, 10 nm, and 50 nm
while dex has a higher rate at 100 nm.
figure 8a shows cos-7 cells treated with 100 nm test

and flu) and e2 are similar (data not shown). figure 8b
shows the graphical representation of test-induced hgr
transport. there was no change in receptor localization due
to this ligand; the best fit line and rate is similar to vehicle.

kinetics of har and hgr transport

articles
there has been no evaluation of the effects of har ligands
on the transport of hgr and vice versa. the har ligands
chosen for analysis vary in their reported affinities for the
har and have several common structural modifications made
to aas in order to alter the pharmacology of the compounds.
dex and cor, chosen to assess hgr transport, have very
different reported affinities to the hgr. with a better
understanding of the relative rates of ligand-induced har
and hgr transport, it may be possible to better understand
why different aas and gcs produce differing effects on a
cellular level. although these studies utilize nonphysiologic
transient transfection, the data obtained add an important
kinetic component to the study of nhr transport.
figures 3 and 4 show the graphical transport data of har
in the presence of har ligands and hgr ligands, respectively. test and other aas produce a robust and dosedependent transport of the har while there is no corinduced transport (figures 1, 2, and 4 show transport of har
in representative cells). the rates of har transport for 11
ligands and 4 doses (unless there was no transport; only the
highest dose was used) are reported in tables 1 and 2.
unexpectedly, the translocation rates obtained are not
affinity-dependent and no distinct correlations were determined because of structural variations.

are similar (data not shown). the rates determined from the
curve fit and the rate relative to vehicle for these ligands are
summarized in table 4. these results were predicted, as nonhgr ligands are not expected to cause the translocation of
har. these data demonstrate that there is no transport of
hgr mediated by aas.

discussion
this study used real time imaging to determine dynamic
effects which occur to the har and the hgr after ligand
binding. the har and the hgr are transcription factors, which,
after ligand binding, shuttle to the nucleus. this ligand-induced
cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation is a very early step in the
transcription process which can be exploited to aid in the
understanding of the moa of these receptors as well as aid in
the identification of agonists (and their potency), antagonists
and other nhr modulators. additionally, the kinetic data
obtained from these studies can aid in our understanding of the
pharmacodynamic actions of aas and related compounds and
can potentially be used for the development of drug delivery
systems which utilize nucleocytoplasmic transport.
although qualitative har transport is well documented
in the literature, only test, dht, and met have been
evaluated, and there has been no report of the kinetics of
transport nor a comparison of any rates for har.2,3,6–8,12,14–16
the transport of hgr has also been studied, but again, no
analysis of rate was performed.1,4,5,9–11,13,25 additionally,

for the har and har ligands, rate of transport is generally
dose dependent, that is, at higher doses, there is a higher
rate of transport. it is interesting to the note that, for some
of the ligands tested (test, ane, met, oxa), there was
a slightly higher rate of transport calculated for the 50 nm
dose than the 100 nm dose. this could be of physiological
significance since the 50 nm dose is close to physiological
concentrations of androgens. extremely high doses of ligands
may be causing the nhrs present in the cos-7 cells to act
irregularly. savory reports that the strength of nhr dimer
(and oligomer) interactions are regulated by ligand binding.37
the very high doses of aas may increase the stability of
dimers or oligomers of nhrs that do not typically occur
and can hinder transport. it has been reported that cos-7
cells have extremely low levels of gr present.38 with very
high doses of aas, there may be some binding of the aas
to grs which are present endogenously in cos-7 cells. after
ligand binding, gr homodimer and/or har:gr heterodimer
interaction with importin r/beta machinery at the nuclear pore
complex may be affecting the apparent import of har
homodimers because of a lower affinity of the ar dimer to
the importin complex. this lower affinity can occur due to
steric effects or differences in the strengths of nuclear localization signals. additionally, the high doses of aas may alter
coregulator recruitment. coactivators are known to stabilize
ligand bound dimers.39 at the high doses of aas, mixed

figure 6. translocation of egfp-hgr in cos-7 cells after cor treatment. representative time points of 0 min, 45
min, and 240 min are shown for 4 treatment concentrations of cor (1 nm, 10 nm, 50 nm, and 100 nm). at 0 min, the
majority of egfp-hgr is cytosolic. at 45 min, egfp-hgr has translocated to the nucleus. at 240 min, transport of
egfp-hgr to the nucleus has plateaued in a dose-dependent manner; more egfp-hgr is nuclear in the cells
treated with the highest dose of test. translocation of dex was similar.

dimers, which may have a reduced transport rate due to reduced
affinity for the importin complex, may be stabilized.
until recently, it was thought that epi had no biological
relevance or steroidal activity; however, it has now been
postulated that epi may act as an endogenous antiandrogen
that aids in the regulation of androgen dependent events.40
we show that epi does cause a dose-dependent har
transport. this information adds to the theory that epi may
have some biological relevance.
flu, which is an antiandrogen and har antagonist, causes
little transport at low dose, but does cause transport at higher
doses. this is contrary to a previous study which says that antagonists do not cause nuclear har translocation.3 as expected,
neither the gcs tested nor e2 caused har translocation.
figures 7 and 8 show graphical representation of hgr
transport after induction with cor, dex, and test. these
data show the robust and dose-dependent cor- and dexinduced transport of hgr, while no hgr transport was seen in
the presence of test (figures 5, 6, and 8 show transport of
hgr in representative cells). the rates of hgr transport for 11
ligands and 4 doses (unless there was no transport; only the
highest dose was used) are reported in tables 3 and 4.
the rate of transport of the hgr ligands cor and dex
was dose-dependent. at high doses, cor and dex transport
was also affinity dependent; at 100 nm, dex, with a much
higher affinity for the hgr than cor, had a much higher
rate of transport (see table 3). this affinity dependence does
not hold true for lower doses, however. at all three lower
doses, cor caused a higher rate of hgr translocation.
although it is likely that, under normal physiologic conditions, dex and cor may saturate the binding of hgr at

low concentrations, translocation was not saturated at the
low doses here. this is likely due to the transient transfection
method used. excess (much more than under normal physiologic conditions) hgr was present in the cells, allowing
for greater binding and translocation. none of the aas tested
or e2 caused hgr translocation (see table 4).

arguments; the aas of varying structures induce different
conformations of the har and therefore cause differential
translocation and perhaps differential association with nuclear

the importin r/beta system).46,47 it is also plausible that the

exposure could account for the varying rates of nuclear
translocation seen in these studies.47–49
further studies attempting to determine the mechanism underlying varying translocation rates are warranted to fully
understand ligand-mediated nhr translocation. mechanistic
studies assessing the affinity of har and hgr to importin r as
well as the utilization of mutants of har and hgr which have
defective nlss can aid in the elucidation of the translocation
mechanism. additionally, assessment of the ligand-induced conformational changes and subsequent coregulator protein recruitment may aid in the determination of mechanism of action.

the translocation of the receptor. however, it does not fully
explain the mechanims of the ar. additional studies, not
within the scope of the presented data, are required to more
fully understand the mechanism of ar action, especially
assessment of the confomational changes induced by each
ligand and how this conformational change recruits other
