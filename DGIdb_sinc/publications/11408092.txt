regional distribution of  xxxg1626xxx  activity and polyamine levels in experimental cat brain tumors.  biosynthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx , and activation of the first key enzyme  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) are closely associated with cellular proliferation. in the present study, the distribution of odc activity and polyamine levels was investigated for the first time regionally in experimental brain tumors of the cat. brain tumors were produced by stereotactic xenotransplantation of rat glioma cells. twenty days after implantation, the brains were frozen in situ, cut into slices, and cryostat sections and tissue samples were taken to determine odc activity and polyamine levels biochemically. the quantified data were color-coded to present the regional distribution of odc activity and polyamine levels in the respective section. odc activity significantly increased in some areas within the tumor, whereas peritumoral tissue showed no difference to the non-tumoral, contralateral hemisphere. this increase turned out in parallel to a high number of mitoses in the same tumor parts (r=0.861). putrescine levels increased both, in the whole tumor and in the peritumoral edema. regional differences in putrescine content did not correlate with solid and proliferative parts of the tumor. spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels were only slightly increased in some parts of the tumor. thus, these experiments show the close correlation of a high mitotic rate and activation of odc within experimental gliomas and underline the relevance of odc as a biochemical marker of proliferation in brain tumors.
