 xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes and
 xxxd59xxx  anticoagulation status:
interaction between both genotypes affects
overanticoagulation
objective: our objective was to assess the effects of  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes on severe overanticoagulation and time to achieve stability and their contributions to dose requirement during the initial phase of
 xxxd59xxx  treatment.
methods: a prospective follow-up study was conducted at 2 anticoagulation clinics in the netherlands. we
assessed the cyp2c9 genotype (cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3 polymorphisms) and the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t genotype
of the subjects and collected data on international normalized ratio, dose, comedication, and comorbidity.
results: of the 231 patients in the cohort, 150 (64.9%) had a  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t polymorphism and 84
(36.4%) had a cyp2c9*2 or cyp2c9*3 allele. only carriers of a combination of a cyp2c9 polymorphism
and a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism had an increased risk of severe overanticoagulation compared with subjects
with no polymorphism or only 1 polymorphism (hazard ratio, 3.83 [95% confidence interval, 1.62-9.05]).
the time to achieve stability was associated with the possession of the cyp2c9 genotype, not with the
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype (hazard ratio for cyp2c9*3 allele compared with cyp2c9 wild type, 0.59 [95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.87]). patients with a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism required significantly lower doses than
 xxxg2418xxx  cc wild-type patients. a larger part of the variability in dose requirement was explained by the
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype than by the cyp2c9 genotype (21.4% and 4.9%, respectively).
conclusion: being a carrier of a combination of polymorphisms of  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9, rather than of one
of these polymorphisms, is associated with severe overanticoagulation. the time to achieve stability is mainly
associated with the cyp2c9 genotype. (clin pharmacol ther 2006;80:13-22.)

anticoagulants of the coumarin type are effective drugs
for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic
diseases. however, the use of these drugs is accompanied by considerable problems as a consequence of the
high interindividual variability, as well as intraindividual variability, in dose requirement. this variability
can partly be explained by age, drug-drug and drugfood interactions, infections, ingestion of varying quantities of  xxxd3522xxx , heart failure, impairment of liver
function,1-5 and cyp2c9 genotype.6-23
polymorphisms of the cyp2c9 gene, which encodes the
main metabolizing enzyme of coumarins, have been extensively studied. an association between possession of at least
1 cyp2c9*2 or cyp2c9*3 allele and reduced dose requirement, severe overanticoagulation, major bleeding risk, and
retarded stabilization has been convincingly demonstrated for
warfarin,6,8,9,11,16,19,24-27  xxxd59xxx ,12,15,18,22 and  xxxd2911xxx .14,28
recently, the presence of polymorphisms in the
 xxxg2418xxx  gene has drawn attention as another source of
variability in the response to coumarins. the enzyme
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) reduces vitamin
k 2,3-epoxide to the biologically active  xxxd3522xxx 
hydroquinone, which catalyzes the production of the
carboxylated blood-clotting proteins ii, vii, ix, and x.
coumarins act by inhibiting  xxxg2418xxx  activity, their target
having been identified as the protein  xxxd3522xxx  reductase complex subunit 1 ( xxxg2418xxx ) encoded by the
homonymous gene  xxxg2418xxx .29,30 in several studies an
association between the presence of polymorphisms of
the  xxxg2418xxx  gene and a reduced dose need of
warfarin31-35 and acenocoumarol36 has been demonstrated. in most of these studies the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype
explained a larger part of the variation in dose requirement than did the cyp2c9 genotype.
because the aforementioned studies mainly focused
on dose requirements as an outcome of coumarin sensitivity, we conducted a study in  xxxd59xxx -using
outpatients to assess the effects of  xxxg2418xxx  and
cyp2c9 genotypes on severe overanticoagulation and
time to achieve stability.
methods
study design and patients. this study was conducted in the same cohort of  xxxd59xxx -using outpatients in whom we earlier examined the association
between cyp2c9 genotype and anticoagulation status.
for full details not described in this article, we refer to
the report of our study previously published in this
journal.15
in brief, the original study was a prospective
follow-up study at 2 anticoagulation clinics in the

clinical pharmacology & therapeutics
july 2006

netherlands. we included patients who started therapy
from november 1998 until september 2002 with the
following characteristics: use of  xxxd59xxx , anticoagulant indication for at least 3 months, and loading
dose of 6, 4, and 2 mg on the first 3 days of therapy,
respectively, with the first international normalized ratio (inr) measurement being taken on the fourth day.
we did not include patients who were taking drugs that
pharmacokinetically interact with coumarins at the start
of  xxxd59xxx  therapy. we excluded from analysis
patients who started pharmacokinetically interacting
drugs during the follow-up period of the study. these
drugs were identified by the dutch standards on the
management of coumarin interactions.37
the medical ethical committee at the utrecht medical centre, utrecht, the netherlands, approved our
earlier study,15 in which we used a blood sample from
a regular inr measurement for cyp2c9 genotyping.
all patients who met the aforementioned criteria were
informed about the aims of the study and were asked
for their written consent, which included a statement
that the samples would be preserved for 10 years maximally for examination of analog research questions.
data collection and follow-up time. we collected
data on sex, age, anticoagulant indication and the corresponding therapeutic inr range, inr measurements,
 xxxd59xxx  doses, comorbidity, infections, and comedication as recorded by the anticoagulation clinics. for
cyp2c9 genotyping, we used blood samples from regular
inr measurements at the anticoagulation clinics. we assessed only the presence of the cyp2c9*2 and
cyp2c9*3 alleles, which are the most frequently occurring variant alleles in white populations. we reanalyzed
the deoxyribonucleic acid samples from the cyp2c9
genotyping to assess the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t genotype. the
single-nucleotide polymorphism c1173t in intron 1 of
the  xxxg2418xxx  gene appears to be as informative about
coumarin sensitivity as 5  xxxg2418xxx  haplotypes, which are
predictive for the warfarin dose requirement and which
together account for 96% to 99% of the total haplotypes in
european-american white populations.35
patients were followed up from the date of the first
 xxxd59xxx  use (entry date) until the end of the
observation period, which was set on the last regular
anticoagulation clinic visit within 190 days from the
entry date.
genotyping. for cyp2c9 genotyping, we refer to
our previous study.15
for the detection of the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t polymorphism, a lightcycler (roche diagnostics, mannheim,
germany) assay was performed (roijers jfm, unpublished data, 2006). during the melting-curve analysis,

both  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 affect overanticoagulation

the hybridization probes dissociate from the target deoxyribonucleic acid at specific melting temperatures.
the presence of a c allele introduces a destabilizing
mismatch, which results in a decreased melting temperature. comparison between lightcycler genotyping
and digestion with a restriction enzyme showed completely concordant results.

 xxxg2418xxx  tt.
outcomes. the primary end points of our study were
as follows:
1. severe overanticoagulation (defined as inr ⬎6.0)
during the observation period. an inr greater than
6.0 is associated with a considerably increased
bleeding risk.38,39
2. time to achieve the first period of stability. this
period was calculated as the time (in days from the
entry date) until the first of 3 consecutive inr
measurements within the therapeutic range, with
these inr measurements encompassing a period of
at least 2 weeks, with a maximum difference between the mean daily dosages of 10%.
secondary end points of our study were mean daily
dosage during the first period of stability and the percentage of variability in dose need that could be explained by  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes.
statistical analysis. for assessment of deviations of
allelic frequencies from hardy-weinberg equilibrium,
we used the chi-square test. to assess hazard ratios of
severe overanticoagulation and time to achieve stability, we used cox proportional hazard models. to assess
differences in mean  xxxd59xxx  dosage during the
first period of stability and percentage of variability
explained by  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes, we
used linear regression models. we examined effect
modification by introducing product terms in our models between the  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes and
between each of these genotypes and other factors, such
as sex and age. in all models we adjusted for the
potential confounders age, sex, and target therapeutic
range. to adjust for confounding comedication, the best
strategy would have been to include potential interacting drugs as time-varying covariates in our models.
however, files from anticoagulation clinics from which
we retrieved our data did not provide reliable information on using time of comedication. therefore we excluded all subjects who initiated use of cytochrome
p450 (cyp) 2c9 –inhibiting drugs from our analyses.
moreover, we tested the robustness of our findings by

reanalyzing our outcomes after exclusion of those patients who started to use antibiotics or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), which can both
contribute to overanticoagulation.40,41
results
of the 231 patients who met the criteria of our study,
5 started to use a pharmacokinetically interacting drug
during the follow-up period and were excluded from
further analysis (table i).
the frequencies of the  xxxg2418xxx  cc,  xxxg2418xxx 
ct, and  xxxg2418xxx  tt genotypes were 35.1%, 48.1%,
and 16.9%, respectively. the frequencies of the
cyp2c9*1, cyp2c9*2, and cyp2c9*3 genotypes
were 63.6%, 16.5%, and 19.9%, respectively. allelic
frequencies of both genotypes were in hardyweinberg equilibrium. there were more men than
women included in our study (57.8% versus 42.2%).
the mean follow-up period was 172 days, and the
mean number of inr measurements during the
follow-up was 14.7 (table i).
for combined  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes,
numbers of patients, numbers of patients with severe
overanticoagulation, numbers of patients in whom stability was achieved, number of days until the first
period of stability was achieved, mean dose requirements in the first period of stability, and initial inr
values are summarized in table ii.
for the association between severe overanticoagulation (inr ⬎6.0) and cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes,
effect modification was found between both genotypes
(for product term in cox model, p ⫽ .020). carriers of
a polymorphism of cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  had a significantly increased risk of severe overanticoagulation
compared with wild-type subjects or carriers of only 1
polymorphism of cyp2c9 or  xxxg2418xxx  (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.85 [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.629.11]) (table iii and fig 1). stratified analysis revealed
that within subjects with at least 1  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism, the risk of severe overanticoagulation was increased in carriers of a cyp2c9 polymorphism compared with cyp2c9 wild-type subjects (adjusted
hazard ratio, 5.83 [95% ci, 1.82-18.6]). however,
within subjects with the  xxxg2418xxx  wild type, the risk of
severe overanticoagulation was not increased in carriers
of a cyp2c9 polymorphism compared with cyp2c9
wild-type subjects (table iii). similarly, within carriers
of a cyp2c9 polymorphism, there was a strong trend
toward an increased risk in subjects with at least 1
 xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism compared with  xxxg2418xxx 
wild-type subjects (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.16 [95% ci,
0.88-9.15]); in contrast, within subjects with the

cyp2c9 wild type, the overanticoagulation risk was
not increased in carriers of a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism.
there was even a weak trend toward a decreased risk
compared with subjects with the  xxxg2418xxx  wild type
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% ci, 0.10-1.40]) (table iii).
the probability to achieve the first period of stability
within the first 6 months of therapy was decreased in
carriers of at least 1 cyp2c9*3 allele compared with
carriers of the cyp2c9 wild type (hazard ratio, 0.59
[95% ci, 0.40-0.87]; p ⫽ .007 [adjusted for differences
in age, sex,  xxxg2418xxx  genotype, and target therapeutic
range]). moreover, if patients achieved stability within
the follow-up time, it took significantly more time for
carriers of at least 1 cyp2c9*3 allele compared with
cyp2c9 wild-type subjects (mean difference, 13.7
days [95% ci, 1.9-25.6]; p ⫽ .023 [adjusted for differences in age, sex, target therapeutic range, and
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype]). there was no significant difference between carriers of at least 1 cyp2c9*2 allele and
the cyp2c9 wild type (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.16

[95% ci, 0.78-1.70]; p ⫽ .47) (fig 2, a). for subjects
with a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism, the chance to achieve
stability was not significantly different from that in
subjects with the  xxxg2418xxx  wild type: hazard ratios for
 xxxg2418xxx  ct and  xxxg2418xxx  tt genotypes compared
with the  xxxg2418xxx  wild type were 1.06 (95% ci, 0.771.46) (p ⫽ .71) and 0.82 (95% ci, 0.53-1.28) (p ⫽
.38), respectively (adjusted for differences in age, sex,

b) (data not shown in table). we found no effect

and cyp2c9 genotypes as we did for severe overanticoagulation.
for subjects in whom stability was achieved compared
with subjects with the  xxxg2418xxx  wild type, the presence of
a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism was associated with a significantly lower mean daily  xxxd59xxx  dose. the adjusted mean difference was 0.56 mg (95% ci, 0.34-0.78

between  xxxg2418xxx  ct subjects and  xxxg2418xxx  cc
subjects (data not shown in table).
the exclusion of all users of nsaids and antibiotics
did not change our results considerably, even without a
loss of statistical significance of our main findings (data

least 1 cyp2c9*3 allele compared with cyp2c9 wildtype subjects. after adjustment, we also found a decreased
dose requirement in carriers of at least 1 cyp2c9*2 allele
compared with cyp2c9 wild-type subjects (adjusted
mean difference, 0.29 mg [95% ci, 0.01-0.56 mg]). for
all combinations of at least 1  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9
polymorphism, except  xxxg2418xxx  cc plus cyp2c9*2, the
mean daily dose requirement was significantly decreased
compared with subjects with the  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9
wild type (table iv).
the combination of age,  xxxg2418xxx  genotype, and
cyp2c9 genotype explained 39.1% of the variation in
mean daily dosage, with adjusted r2 values of 12.8%
for age, 21.4% for  xxxg2418xxx  genotype, and 4.9% for
cyp2c9 genotype (data not shown in table).
we identified 38 subjects (16.4%) with a supratherapeutic initial inr, assessed on the fourth day of
 xxxd59xxx  use after the fixed starting dose of
6-4-2 mg. the risk of a supratherapeutic initial inr
was increased only in users of the  xxxg2418xxx  tt
genotype compared with both  xxxg2418xxx  ct and
 xxxg2418xxx  cc subjects (odds ratio, 5.07 [95% ci,
2.00-12.8] [adjusted for differences in age, sex, and
cyp2c9 genotype]). on the other hand, there was no

discussion
the results of our study, in which we evaluated the
role of cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes on the anticoagulation status of patients taking  xxxd59xxx ,
strongly suggest that the association between the possession of the variant allele cyp2c9*2 or cyp2c9*3
and severe overanticoagulation that we found in our
earlier study15 is modified by the  xxxg2418xxx  1173ct
genotype, with only carriers of a combination of
cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms having an increased risk. however, the probability of achieving
stability within the follow-up period appears to be
mainly associated with the cyp2c9 genotype, although
the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype explains a considerably larger
part of the variation in mean daily dosage than the
cyp2c9 genotype.
the allele frequencies we found for the c⫺1173
allele (59.1%) and the t⫺1173 allele (40.9%) were in
accordance with other studies in several white populations, with t⫺1173 allele frequencies varying from
39.1% to 45.8%.33,36,42
our results regarding the association of the  xxxg2418xxx 
genotype with coumarin dose requirements are in
agreement with the findings of other studies in users of
 xxxd59xxx , as well as warfarin.32-35,43
sconce et al34 and wadelius et al32 made predictive
regression models for dose requirements in warfarinusing patients in english and swedish anticoagulation
clinics, respectively. both models with the cyp2c9
genotype,  xxxg2418xxx  genotype, age, and several other
factors predicted 54% to 56% of the variation in dose
requirement. our model with the cyp2c9 genotype,
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype, and age explained a smaller part of
the variation in dose requirement (39.1%), but we had
a smaller number of variables at our disposal. our
finding that the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype contributed more
than the cyp2c9 genotype to the variability in dose
requirement was in agreement with studies in warfarin
users of rieder et al,35 wadelius et al,32 and bodin et
al.36 in contrast, in the studies of d’andrea et al33 and
sconce et al,34 a larger contribution of the cyp2c9
genotype than of the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype to the dose
requirement has been reported. this could be because

genotype (a) and  xxxg2418xxx  genotype (b). a, the difference between cyp2c9*3 (dashed line) and
cyp2c9*1/*1 (solid line) was significant (log rank test, ␹21 ⫽ 7.13; p ⫽ .008). b, there were no
significant differences between the  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes (log rank test for comparison of  xxxg2418xxx 
tt with  xxxg2418xxx  cc, ␹21 ⫽ 0.38; p ⫽ .54).

of the higher proportion of cyp2c9 variant alleles in
their studies compared with our study: for cyp2c9*2
and cyp2c9*3, d’andrea et al33 had allelic frequencies of 17.0% and 8.8%, respectively; sconce et al34
had frequencies of 14.2% and 9.4%, respectively; and
we had frequencies of 9.5% and 10.4%, respectively.
furthermore, differences in the percentage of explained
variance and relative contribution of different genotypes can also be a consequence of differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria between studies.
of the aforementioned authors, only bodin et al36
studied the effects of the cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes as determinants of  xxxd59xxx  sensitivity,
whereas the other studies were aimed at warfarin. however, bodin et al36 conducted their study in healthy
volunteers. as far as we know, our study is the first to
examine the effects of the combined  xxxg2418xxx  and
cyp2c9 genotypes in  xxxd59xxx -using patients.
in a case-control study reitsma et al44 found an increased bleeding risk in  xxxd2911xxx -using carriers of
a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism compared with  xxxg2418xxx  wildtype subjects, whereas such an increased risk was not
found in  xxxd59xxx  users. although this study failed

to show an effect for  xxxd59xxx , the finding for
 xxxd2911xxx  underlines the increased sensitivity of
carriers of a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism compared with
 xxxg2418xxx  wild-type subjects. a limitation of this otherwise interesting study was the lack of data on the cyp2c9
genotype, which makes a comparison with our finding of
an interaction between both genotypes affecting overanticoagulation impossible.
our study adds 2 interesting novel findings to all
other hitherto performed studies. first, the risk of severe overanticoagulation is significantly increased in
patients with a combination of polymorphisms of
 xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9, as compared with patients with
no polymorphism or maximally 1 polymorphism of
either gene. this necessitates a reconsideration of the
findings of earlier studies that demonstrated an increased risk of overanticoagulation in carriers of a
cyp2c9 polymorphism9,15,18,22 and underlines the importance of the knowledge of both  xxxg2418xxx  and
cyp2c9 polymorphisms to identify patients at risk of
severe overanticoagulation. our finding that within
cyp2c9 subjects there was a weak trend toward a
decreased risk of overanticoagulation in carriers of a

 xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism compared with  xxxg2418xxx 
wild-type subjects was not expected and is probably a
chance finding. other studies are needed to elucidate
this subject further.
our second novel and, at first sight, unexpected
finding is that the search for a stable  xxxd59xxx 
dose regimen appears to be associated more with the
cyp2c9 genotype than with the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype.
only carriers of at least 1 cyp2c9*3 allele had a
decreased chance to achieve stability compared with
patients with the cyp2c9 wild type or carriers of a
cyp2c9*2 allele. this seems to contrast with our finding that  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms account for a larger
part of the variability in dose need. however, especially
because the possession of a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism is
associated more with a lower dose need, dose adjustments in carriers of such polymorphisms will point
faster to a lower dose need compared with dose adjustments in carriers of only a cyp2c9 polymorphism.
this might result in faster stabilization with a lower
dose. on the other hand, possession of the “pharmacokinetic” cyp2c9*3 allele results in detectable quantities of the more active s-enantiomer of  xxxd59xxx 
in contrast to patients with only cyp2c9*1 or *2
alleles (or both of these alleles), in whom the coumarin
effect is exclusively based on the less active

r-enantiomer.45 so, without cyp2c9 genotyping, anticoagulation clinics unknowingly manage 2 anticoagulants with different pharmacokinetic profiles in carriers
of a cyp2c9*3 allele,15 independent of the  xxxg2418xxx 
genotype. this indicates that knowledge of the
cyp2c9 genotype could be more important for guidance to a stable  xxxd59xxx  dose in the long term
than knowledge of the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype.
our study indicates that using data of both the
 xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes might contribute to
the development of new and safer dosing and monitoring algorithms in  xxxd59xxx  users. of course, this
issue has to be further examined in prospective studies.
some limitations of our study have to be considered.
because we had only medical data of anticoagulation
clinics at our disposal, we could have missed relevant
data about comorbidities and comedication. furthermore, because our study was originally designed to
examine the effects of 2 cyp2c9 alleles on  xxxd59xxx  anticoagulation status, the numbers of patients
with overanticoagulation and nonstabilization in the
combined strata of cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms had become too low for examination of risks in
specific combinations of genotypes such as cyp2c9*3
and  xxxg2418xxx  tt. however, our results proved to be

clinical pharmacology & therapeutics
2006;80(1):13-22

both  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 affect overanticoagulation

robust after exclusion of users of nsaids and antibiotics from our cohort.
in conclusion, our study shows that in  xxxd59xxx  users the possession of a combination of polymorphisms of  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9, rather than the
possession of one of these polymorphisms, is associated with severe overanticoagulation and that the time
to achieve a period of stability seems to be associated
only with the cyp2c9 genotype. being a carrier of a
 xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism or a cyp2c9 polymorphism
is associated with lower  xxxd59xxx  dose requirements compared with those in wild-type subjects, with
the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype explaining a larger part of the
variability in dose requirement.
