this review focuses on the mechanisms of action of histone
deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors (hdaci), a group of
recently discovered ‘targeted’ anticancer agents. there are
18 hdacs, which are generally divided into four classes,
based on sequence homology to yeast counterparts.
classical hdaci such as the hydroxamic acid-based
 xxxd3529xxx  (also known as saha and  xxxd3529xxx ) inhibits
classes i, ii and iv, but not the nad þ -dependent class iii
enzymes. in clinical trials,  xxxd3529xxx  has activity against
hematologic and solid cancers at doses well tolerated by
patients. in addition to histones, hdacs have many other
protein substrates involved in regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation and cell death. inhibition of
hdacs causes accumulation of acetylated forms of these
proteins, altering their function. thus, hdacs are more
properly called ‘lysine deacetylases.’ hdaci induces
different phenotypes in various transformed cells, including growth arrest, activation of the extrinsic and/or
intrinsic apoptotic pathways, autophagic cell death,
reactive oxygen species (ros)-induced cell death, mitotic
cell death and senescence. in comparison, normal cells are
relatively more resistant to hdaci-induced cell death.
the plurality of mechanisms of hdaci-induced cell death
reﬂects both the multiple substrates of hdacs and the
heterogeneous patterns of molecular alterations present in
different cancer cells.

introduction
acetylation and deacetylation of histones play an
important role in transcription regulation of eukaryotic
cells (lehrmann et al., 2002; mai et al., 2005). the
acetylation status of histones and non-histone proteins
is determined by histone deacetylases (hdacs) and
histone acetyl-transferases (hats). hats add acetyl

groups to lysine residues, while hdacs remove the
acetyl groups. in general, acetylation of histone promotes a more relaxed chromatin structure, allowing
transcriptional activation. hdacs can act as transcription repressors, due to histone deacetylation, and
consequently promote chromatin condensation. hdac
inhibitors (hdaci) selectively alter gene transcription,
in part, by chromatin remodeling and by changes in the
structure of proteins in transcription factor complexes
(gui et al., 2004). further, the hdacs have many nonhistone proteins substrates such as hormone receptors,
chaperone proteins and cytoskeleton proteins, which
regulate cell proliferation and cell death (table 1). thus,
hdaci-induced transformed cell death involves transcription-dependent and transcription-independent
mechanisms (marks and dokmanovic, 2005; rosato and
grant, 2005; bolden et al., 2006; minucci and pelicci,
2006).
in humans, 18 hdac enzymes have been identiﬁed
and classiﬁed, based on homology to yeast hdacs
(blander and guarente, 2004; bhalla, 2005; marks and
dokmanovic, 2005). class i hdacs include hdac1,
2, 3 and 8, which are related to yeast  xxxg1033xxx   xxxg1034xxx   xxxg1035xxx  deacetylase
and have high homology in their catalytic sites. recent
phylogenetic analyses suggest that this class can be
divided into classes ia (hdac1 and -2), ib ( xxxg1035xxx )
and ic ( xxxg1039xxx ) (gregoretti et al., 2004). class ii
hdacs are related to yeast hda1 (histone deacetylase
1) and include  xxxg1036xxx , -5, -6, -7, -9 and -10 (bhalla,
2005; marks and dokmanovic, 2005). this class is
divided into class iia, consisting of  xxxg1036xxx , -5, -7 and
-9, and class iib, consisting of  xxxg1037xxx  and -10, which
contain two catalytic sites. all class i and ii hdacs are
zinc-dependent enzymes. members of a third class,
sirtuins, require nad þ for their enzymatic activity
(blander and guarente, 2004) (see review by e verdin,
in this issue). among them, sirt1 is orthologous to
yeast silent information regulator 2. the enzymatic
activity of class iii hdacs is not inhibited by
compounds such as  xxxd3529xxx  or  xxxd3426xxx 
(tsa), that inhibit class i and ii hdacs. class iv
hdac is represented by hdac11, which, like yeast
hda 1 similar 3, has conserved residues in the catalytic
core region shared by both class i and ii enzymes (gao
et al., 2002).
hdacs are not redundant in function (marks and
dokmanovic, 2005; rosato and grant, 2005; bolden
et al., 2006). class i hdacs are primarily nuclear in
localization and ubiquitously expressed, while class ii

hdacs can be primarily cytoplasmic and/or migrate
between the cytoplasm and nucleus and are tissuerestricted in expression.
the structural details of the hdac–hdaci interaction has been elucidated in studies of a histone
deacetylase-like protein from an anerobic bacterium with
tsa and  xxxd3529xxx  (finnin et al., 1999). more recently, the
crystal structure of  xxxg1039xxx –hydroxamate interaction has
been solved (somoza et al., 2004; vannini et al., 2004).
these studies provide an insight into the mechanism of
deacetylation of acetylated substrates. the hydroxamic acid
moiety of the inhibitor directly interacts with the zinc ion at
the base of the catalytic pocket.
this review focuses on the molecular mechanisms
triggered by inhibitors of zinc-dependent hdacs in
tumor cells that explain in part: (i) the effects of these
compounds in inducing transformed cell death and (ii)
the relative resistance of normal and certain cancer cells
to hdaci induced cell death. hdaci, for example, the
hydroxamic acid-based  xxxd3529xxx  (saha,  xxxd3529xxx ), are
promising drugs for cancer treatment (richon et al.,
1998; marks and breslow, 2007). several hdaci are in
phase i and ii clinical trials, being tested in different
tumor types, such as cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, acute
myeloid leukemia, cervical cancer, etc (bug et al., 2005;
chavez-blanco et al., 2005; kelly and marks, 2005;
duvic and zhang, 2006) (table 2). although considerable progress has been made in elucidating the role of
hdacs and the effects of hdaci, these areas are still
in early stages of discovery.

been identiﬁed, which may be acetylated and substrates
of hdacs (table 1) (glozak et al., 2005; marks and
dokmanovic, 2005; rosato and grant, 2005; bolden
et al., 2006; minucci and pelicci, 2006; zhao et al.,
2006). in addition, two recent proteomic studies
identiﬁed many lysine-acetylated substrates (iwabata
et al., 2005; kim et al., 2006). in view of all these
ﬁndings, hdacs may be better called ‘n-epsilon-lysine
deacetylase’. this designation would also distinguish
them from the enzymes that catalyse other types of
deacetylation in biological reactions, such as acylases
that catalyse the deacetylation of a range of na-acetyl
amino acids (anders and dekant, 1994).
non-histone protein targets of hdacs include
transcription factors, transcription regulators, signal
transduction mediators, dna repair enzymes, nuclear
import regulators, chaperone proteins, structural
proteins, inﬂammation mediators and viral proteins
(table 1). acetylation can either increase or decrease the
function or stability of the proteins, or protein–protein
interaction (glozak et al., 2005). these hdac substrates are directly or indirectly involved in many
biological processes, such as gene expression and
regulation of pathways of proliferation, differentiation
and cell death. these data suggest that hdaci could
have multiple mechanisms of inducing cell growth arrest
and cell death (figure 1).
hdaci

hdac substrates
recent phylogenetic analyses of bacterial hdacs
suggest that all four hdac classes preceded the
evolution of histone proteins (gregoretti et al., 2004).
this suggests that the primary activity of hdacs may
be directed against non-histone substrates. at least 50
non-histone proteins of known biological function have
oncogene

hdaci have been discovered with different structural
characteristics, including hydroximates, cyclic peptides,
aliphatic acids and benzamides (table 2) (miller et al.,
2003; yoshida et al., 2003; marks and breslow, 2007).
certain hdaci may selectively inhibit different
hdacs. for example,  xxxd2001xxx  preferentially inhibits
hdac1 with ic50, at 0.3 mm, compared to  xxxg1035xxx 
with an ic50 of about 8 mm, and has little or no

inhibitory effect against  xxxg1037xxx  and  xxxg1039xxx  (hu
et al., 2003). two novel synthetic compounds, sk7041
and sk7068, preferentially target hdac1 and 2 and
exhibit growth inhibitory effects in human cancer cell
lines and tumor xenograft models (kim et al., 2003a). a
small molecule, tubacin, selectively inhibits  xxxg1037xxx 
activity and causes an accumulation of acetylated atubulin, but does not affect acetylation of histones, and
does not inhibit cell cycle progression (haggarty et al.,
2003). no other hdaci for a speciﬁc hdac has been
reported.
hdaci selectively alters gene expression
hdaci can affect transcription by inducing acetylation
of histones, transcription factors and other proteins
regulating transcription (table 1) (glozak et al., 2005;
marks and dokmanovic, 2005; bolden et al.,
2006; minucci and pelicci, 2006). early differential
display experiments with lymphoid cell lines cultured
with tsa showed that only 2% of 340 genes examined
were altered in their expression, either increased
or decreased, compared to untreated cells (van lint
et al., 1996). recent studies using cdna arrays showed
as many as 7–10% of genes were altered in their
expression in cell lines of leukemia, multiple myeloma,
and carcinomas of colon, bladder, kidney, prostate
and breast, cultured for up to 48 h with butyrate,
tsa,  xxxd2001xxx ,  xxxd3529xxx  or fk228 ( xxxd1841xxx ) using
twofold change as the cut-off value (chambers et al.,
2003; glaser et al., 2003; mitsiades et al., 2004;
peart et al., 2005; sasakawa et al., 2005). the time of
culture, concentration and the hdaci used affect
the number of genes detected with altered transcription.
short time points (chambers et al., 2003; mitsiades
et al., 2004; sasakawa et al., 2005) and low concentrations (glaser et al., 2003) cause fewer changes in gene
transcription, while the magnitude of change

and number of genes altered increase to certain
extent with the increase of time of culture and
concentration of hdaci. some changes in gene
expression are probably direct effects of the hdaci
on the gene promoter and other secondary and downstream effects. the patterns of alterations of gene
expression are similar for different hdac inhibitors,
but show deﬁnite differences induced by different agents
in various transformed cells (glaser et al., 2003; gray
et al., 2004; mitsiades et al., 2004; peart et al., 2005;
sasakawa et al., 2005). in these several studies, it has
been found that hdaci induce about as many genes as
are repressed.
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21
( xxxg418xxx / xxxg418xxx ) is one of the most common genes induced
by hdaci (archer et al., 1998; richon et al., 2000;
sasakawa et al., 2002). hdaci-induced expression of
p21 is independent of p53 and correlates with an
increase in the acetylation of histones associated with
the p21 promoter region (richon et al., 2000; gui et al.,
2004). in arp-1 cells,  xxxd3529xxx  caused speciﬁc
modiﬁcations in the pattern of acetylation and methylation of lysines in histones h3 and h4 associated with the
proximal promoter of the p21 gene (gui et al., 2004).
these changes did not occur in the histones associated
with the promoter region of the expressed p27 ( xxxg419xxx ) or
the silent epsilon globin gene in arp-1 cells, and neither
gene was altered in its expression by  xxxd3529xxx . the
protein complex associated with the proximal promoter
region of the p21 gene contained hdac1 and -2, myc,
baf155, brg-1,  xxxg1226xxx , p300 and sp1.  xxxd3529xxx 
caused a marked decrease in hdac1 and myc, and
recruitment of rna polymerase ii, with little detectable
changes in  xxxg1034xxx  or other proteins in the complex.
the loss of hdac1 from the complex was not
associated with a decrease in this protein in the nuclear
extract (gui et al., 2004). these ﬁndings suggest that the
selective alteration of transcription of a gene by hdaci
may be determined by the speciﬁc composition and
oncogene

conﬁguration of proteins in the transcription factor
complex including the hdacs.
hdac activity is required for transcriptional activation mediated by signal transducer and activator of
transcription 5 ( xxxg2216xxx ) (rascle et al., 2003). inhibiting
hdac activity can prevent expression of genes for
which  xxxg2216xxx  is required, and result in repression of
their expression. hdaci-induced transcriptional repression of  xxxg183xxx  (ar) results from the
induction of a suppressor complex (wang et al., 2004).
hdaci-induced antitumor pathways
hdaci can induce transformed cell growth arrest,
terminal differentiation, cell death and/or inhibition of
angiogenesis (figure 1). normal cells are relatively
resistant to hdaci-induced cell death (burgess et al.,
2004; insinga et al., 2005; ungerstedt et al., 2005). the
cell death pathways identiﬁed in mediating hdaciinduced transformed cell death include apoptosis
(rosato and grant, 2005; bolden et al., 2006; minucci
and pelicci, 2006) by the intrinsic (rueﬂi et al., 2001)
and extrinsic pathways, mitotic catastrophe/cell death
(qiu et al., 2000; dowling et al., 2005; xu et al., 2005),
autophagic cell death (shao et al., 2004), senescence (xu
et al., 2005) and reactive oxygen species (ros)facilitated cell death (rosato and grant, 2005; ungerstedt et al., 2005). the response to hdaci appears to
depend, in part at least, on the nature of hdaci,
concentration and time of exposure, and importantly,
the cell context.
hdaci induces cell cycle arrest
hdaci induce cell cycle arrest in both normal and
transformed cells (marks and dokmanovic, 2005;
ungerstedt et al., 2005). low concentrations of hdaci
predominantly induce g1 arrest, while high concentrations induce both g1 and g2/m arrests (richon et al.,
2000). g1 and g2 arrests are largely associated with
induction of p21, which inhibits cdks regulating g1
progression ( xxxg411xxx /6) and g1/s transition ( xxxg410xxx ), the
activity of  xxxg1681xxx  that is
required for dna replication (vidal and koff, 2000),
and  xxxg407xxx /cdk1 that regulates g2/m transition. loss of
p21 abolishes hdaci-induced g1 arrest (archer et al.,
1998; rosato et al., 2001; xu et al., 2005). g1 arrest was
observed in cells without p21 (hitomi et al., 2003). in
this case, hdaci may induce other cdk inhibitors that
cause cell cycle arrest. tsa induced g1 arrest in human
colon hct116 p21/ cells associated with the
induction of p15 ( xxxg422xxx ), which is an inhibitor of the
cyclin d-dependent kinases (hitomi et al., 2003).
p27, which inhibits  xxxg411xxx - and  xxxg410xxx -containing
complexes (vidal and koff, 2000), was induced by
 xxxd3529xxx  and/or tsa, in leukemia cells k562 and
lama-84 (nimmanapalli et al., 2003), and breast
cancer cells mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 (huang and
pardee, 2000). in cells cultured with hdaci, the
increase of the cdk inhibitors and the decrease of
cyclins may act together to account for the reduced
oncogene

cdk activity, causing dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (rb), which blocks e2f activities in the
transcription of genes for g1 progression and g1/s
transition (bolden et al., 2006). transformed cells
sensitive to hdaci-induced cell death are generally cell
growth-arrested with increase of p21 expression (huang
and pardee, 2000; xu et al., 2006). hdaci can kill both
proliferating and non-proliferating cells (burgess et al.,
2004). this is in contrast to the action of many
chemotherapeutic drugs, which are effective only on
proliferating cells.
in some cells, the g1 arrest is associated with terminal
differentiation (marks et al., 1996). the property of
 xxxd3529xxx  to induce differentiation of transformed cells
was discovered before identifying its inhibitory activity
against hdacs (marks and breslow, 2007).
hdaci activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathways
the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by the
binding of death receptors, including fas ( xxxg764xxx  or  xxxg764xxx ),
 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) receptor-1 (tnfr-1),
 xxxg2303xxx  (trail or
 xxxg2298xxx -l) receptors ( xxxg1057xxx  and -5), dr-3 (apo3) and
dr-6, to their ligands, such as fasl, tnf, trail and
 xxxd2557xxx  (apo3l), leading to activation of  xxxg342xxx  and
caspase-10 (ashkenazi, 2002). hdaci can upregulate
the expression of both death receptors and their ligands,
in vitro and in vivo, in transformed cells, but not in
normal cells (nakata et al., 2004; insinga et al., 2005).
fas and fasl were induced in human neuroblastoma
cells by m-carboxycinnamic acid bihydroxamide (glick
et al., 1999), nude mice xenograft of human osteosarcoma cells by fk228, and mouse model of apl by vpa
(insinga et al., 2005). trail and its receptor  xxxg1057xxx 
were induced in the mouse model of apl by vpa
(insinga et al., 2005), and jurkat human t-cell
lymphoblast leukemia cells and skw6.4b lymphoblast
cells by  xxxd1797xxx  (rosato et al., 2006). hdaci
upregulated  xxxg1057xxx  in various transformed cells. expression of  xxxg2296xxx  was upregulated by fk228 in hl-60 and
k562 cells.  xxxg436xxx , an inhibitor of the death receptor
pathway, was downregulated by hdaci (nakata et al.,
2004; peart et al., 2005; rosato and grant, 2005;
sutheesophon et al., 2005).
hdaci-induced cell death can be reduced by
chimeras of  xxxg1057xxx -fc (anti-trail) or fas-fc (antifas), monoclonal antibodies against fasl or trail
and small inhibitor rna (sirna) of trail or fas
(nakata et al., 2004; insinga et al., 2005; rosato and
grant, 2005). taken together, the data indicate that the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway can account for hdaciinduced cell death in many transformed cells.
hdaci activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathways
the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is mediated by mitochondria, with the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins, such as  xxxg569xxx , apoptosis
inducing factor (aif) and smac, and the consequent
activation of caspases. it is regulated, in part, by proand antiapoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family (jiang and
wang, 2004). activation of the intrinsic apoptotic

mechanisms of histone deacetylase inhibitors
ws xu et al

pathway is a major pathway for hdaci to induce cell
death. by mechanisms that are still not well understood, hdaci leads to release of  xxxg569xxx  from
mitochondrial intermembrane space and activation
caspase-9 (marks and dokmanovic, 2005; bolden
et al., 2006). overexpression of bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx ,
which protect mitochondria, inhibits hdaci-induced
apoptosis. inhibition of bcl-2 by a chemical inhibitor
ha14-1 increases hdaci-induced cell death (xu et al.,
2006).
hdaci alter the factors that mediate or regulate the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway. bid cleavage, which can
initiate the intrinsic pathway (bolden et al., 2006),
occurred before mitochondrial disruption in cem cells
cultured with  xxxd3529xxx  or oxamﬂatin (rueﬂi et al.,
2001; peart et al., 2003). hdaci upregulate proapoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family, such as bim, bmf, bax,
bak and bik (zhang et al., 2004; zhao et al., 2005; xu
et al., 2006). the mechanism of this effect is not
understood. it has been shown that  xxxd3529xxx  and
tsa increase bim transcription by increasing the
activity of  xxxg668xxx  (zhao et al., 2005). hdaci decrease
antiapoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family, such as bcl-2,
 xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg253xxx  and  xxxg1388xxx  (zhang et al., 2004; rosato
et al., 2006; xu et al., 2006). hdaci decrease the
inhibitor of apoptosis (iap)  xxxg2432xxx  by suppressing its
transcription (zhang et al., 2004; rosato et al., 2006),
and survivin by inducing protein degradation (rosato
et al., 2006). hdaci cause the release of the mitochondrial intermembrane proteins,  xxxg569xxx , aif
and smac (rueﬂi et al., 2001; rosato et al., 2006), and
may also increase their levels (xu et al., 2006).
the effects of hdaci to increase the proapoptotic
proteins and decrease the antiapoptotic proteins are cell
context dependent. the basal level of these proteins
vary dramatically in different tumor cells even of
the same type of cancer, for example, prostate, as do
the changes in these proteins induced by hdaci (xu
et al., 2006).
using the eu-myc mouse model of b-cell lymphoma,
 xxxd3529xxx  was found to selectively induce lymphoma
cell death (in vivo), which was independent of p53 and
death receptor pathways (lindemann et al., 2007).
sensititivity to the hdaci was dependent on expression
of the bh3 – only proteins and bid and bim.
hdaci induces mitotic cell death
hdaci can induce mitotic defects associated with
aberrant acetylation of histones in heterochromatin
and centromere domains. newly replicated chromatin
contains acetylated histones. in culture with tsa,
histones in newly synthesized chromatin remain acetylated, and this disrupts the structure and function of the
centromere and the pericentric heterochromatin, with
loss of binding to heterochromatin binding proteins
(taddei et al., 2001; cimini et al., 2003). histone
acetylation interferes with histone phosphorylation and
disrupts the function of mitotic spindle checkpoint
proteins, such as bubr1, hbub1, cenp-f and
cenp-e (dowling et al., 2005; robbins et al., 2005).
as a result, the cells show a transient arrest at

prometaphase, followed with aberrant mitosis such as
missegregation and loss of chromosomes, resulting in
cell death by either apoptosis or, mitotic cell death/
catastrophe (qiu et al., 2000; cimini et al., 2003; xu
et al., 2005). hdaci-induced a-tubulin acetylation does
not affect mitosis, although a-tubulin is a component of
mitotic spindle that mediates mitosis. the hdac6speciﬁc inhibitor tubacin induced a-tubulin acetylation,
but did not affect cell cycle progression (haggarty et al.,
2003). fk228 caused mitotic arrest, but did not inhibit
tubulin deacetylase  xxxg1037xxx .
hdaci induces autophagic cell death and senescence
hela cells with  xxxg169xxx  knockout or  xxxg251xxx  overexpression were induced to autophagic cell death with
autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm, when cultured
with  xxxd3529xxx  or butyrate (shao et al., 2004). in colon
carcinoma cells, senescence phenotype was observed in
 xxxd3529xxx -induced polyploidy cells associated with
mitotic defects (xu et al., 2005).
ros, thioredoxin and trx binding protein 2 in
hdaci-induced cell death
accumulation of ros occurs in transformed cells
cultured with hdaci, such as  xxxd3529xxx , tsa,
butyrate or  xxxd2001xxx  (rueﬂi et al., 2001; rosato et al.,
2003; ungerstedt et al., 2005; xu et al., 2006).
accumulation of ros may be important in hdaciinduced cell death. ros accumulation occurs within 2 h
of culture with hdaci, before disruption of mitochondria. free radical scavengers such as  xxxd68xxx 
decrease hdaci-induced apoptosis (rueﬂi et al., 2001;
rosato et al., 2003).
in many transformed cells, ros-oxidation–reduction
pathways are important mechanisms of hdaciinduced transformed cell death (ungerstedt et al., 2005;
xu et al., 2006). thioredoxin (trx) acts as a hydrogen
donor required for activation of many proteins, including ribonucleotide reductase that is essential for dna
synthesis, and transcription factors, for example, nuclear factor kb ( xxxg1559xxx ), and is an antioxidant scavenger
of ros (lillig and holmgren, 2007). hdaci upregulates the expression of trx binding protein 2 (tbp2)
(butler et al., 2002; xu et al., 2006), which binds and
inhibits trx activity (nishiyama et al., 1999), and can
cause downregulation of trx in transformed but not
normal cells (butler et al., 2002; ungerstedt et al., 2005).
trx is an inhibitor of apoptosis signal regulating kinase
1 (ask1) (saitoh et al., 1998). ask1 promotes
apoptosis by activation of set1-jnk and  xxxg1363xxx /
mkk6-p38 signaling cascades, and by enhancing the
expression of proapoptotic protein bim through a
positive feedback on  xxxg668xxx  activity (tan et al., 2006).
inhibition of trx by tbp2 activates ask1. further,
hdaci increase the expression of ask1. these effects
can act together to promote apoptosis. ros accumulation may also be a consequence of apoptosis. the pancaspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk blocked  xxxd2001xxx -induced
apoptosis as well as ros accumulation in human
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (lucas et al., 2004).

antitumor effects of  xxxg1037xxx  inhibition
 xxxg1037xxx  is an unique hdac, localized in the cytoplasm,
where it associates with non-histone substrates,
such as hsp90 and a-tubulin. it has two catalytic domains
and a ubiquitin binding domain, named buz domain
(zhang et al., 2006; zou et al., 2006). overexpression
of  xxxg1037xxx  leads to deacetylation of a-tubulin and
increases cell motility (hubbert et al., 2002; haggarty
et al., 2003).  xxxg1037xxx  can not only bind both mono and
poly-ubiquitinated proteins but also promote its own
mono-ubiquitination. speciﬁc inhibition of  xxxg1037xxx  activity or its downregulation by sirna increases a-tubulin
and hsp90 acetylation, which reduces cellular motility,
and induces hsp90 client proteins degradation,
cell growth inhibition and cell death (bali et al., 2005;
kovacs et al., 2005). acetylated hsp90 cannot form
stable complex with client proteins and its deacetylation
by  xxxg1037xxx  is required to regenerate functional hsp90
(aoyagi and archer, 2005). hsp90 acetylation is
associated with loss of function, and its client proteins
such as pro-survival and pro-proliferation proteins
akt, bcr-abl, c-raf and erbb2 can be poly-ubiquitinated
and degraded via proteosome (bali et al., 2005; chen et al.,
2005). inhibition of  xxxg1037xxx  by either speciﬁc or panhdaci can trigger different mechanisms of cell death.
 xxxg1037xxx  may also be involved in upregulating p21. runx2
(cbfa1, aml-3) is a transcription factor that can bind
 xxxg1037xxx , recruit it to the p21 promoter and repress its
expression. inhibition of  xxxg1037xxx  activity could result in
induction of p21 and, consequently, cell cycle arrest
(westendorf et al., 2002).
activation of protein phosphatase 1 hdaci can
disrupt phosphatase complexes. recombinant  xxxg1037xxx 
binds directly to protein phosphatase 1 (pp1) catalytic
subunit. tsa disrupts endogenous  xxxg1037xxx –pp1 complexes (brush et al., 2004). hdac1 and 10 are also
components of cellular phosphatase complexes. hdaci
disrupt hdac–pp1 complexes and activate pp1, which
inactivates akt by dephosphorylation (chen et al.,
2005). the interactions between hdacs and pp1
provide a mechanism by which hdaci can cause
simultaneous changes in cellular protein phosphorylation and acetylation, which contribute to the antitumor
activity of hdaci.
disruption of the function of chaperonin hsp90 hdaci can cause accumulation of acetylated hsp90 through
 xxxg1037xxx  inhibition, with consequent inactivation of
hsp90 (bali et al., 2005). as indicated above, this
chaperone protein is essential for the stability
and function of many client proteins, including steroid
hormone receptors and protein kinases, that are crucial
for numerous cell signaling processes and cellular
homeostasis (solit and rosen, 2006). recent studies
have demonstrated both a direct physical interaction
between  xxxg1037xxx  and hsp90, and  xxxg1037xxx  as a
regulator of hsp90 activity, through its deacetylation
(bali et al., 2005; kovacs et al., 2005). considering
the number of hsp90 client proteins, many molecular
oncogene

alterations can be anticipated as a result of hsp90
inactivation through  xxxg1037xxx  inhibition by hdaci, or
its downregulation by  xxxg1037xxx  sirna. the effects of
inactivation of hsp90 include non-functional  xxxg1601xxx  with defects in ligand binding, nuclear
translocation and transcription activation (kovacs
et al., 2005).
ar can be acetylated and become more transcriptionally active, suggesting that some hdaci could
stimulate cell proliferation (fu et al., 2003). however,
hdaci inhibit  xxxg1037xxx  and consequently hsp90,
which hypothetically can overcome the ar activation
(as a consequence of its acetylation) by inducing its
degradation. further, hdaci suppress ar transcription (wang et al., 2004). these ﬁndings suggest that
hdaci may be promising for the treatment of
hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
in human leukemia k562 cells, the knockdown of
 xxxg1037xxx  by sirna or culture with hdaci  xxxd1797xxx 
induces acetylation of hsp90 and a-tubulin, and inhibits
the binding of hsp90 to atp (bali et al., 2005),
disrupting hsp90 chaperone function with client
proteins, inducing poly-ubiquitinalation and partial
depletion of bcr-abl. targeted inhibition of  xxxg1037xxx 
led to polyubiquitylation and depletion of other progrowth and pro-survival hsp90 client proteins, including akt. these studies indicate that inhibition of
 xxxg1037xxx  leads to disruption of the antiapoptotic akt
pathway, either by akt dephosphorylation and/or by its
degradation.
disruption of the aggresome pathway  xxxg1037xxx  is a
component of the aggresome, a cellular structure that
constitutes the major site of degradation for misfolded
protein aggregates, both non-ubiquitinated and ubiquitinated misfolded proteins (kawaguchi et al., 2003).
direction of misfolded proteins to aggresomes is
essential for cell survival, since these proteins are
susceptible to forming cytotoxic aggregates that can
interfere with normal cell function. aggresome formation requires the microtubule network and the microtubule-associated motor, dynein (johnston et al., 2002).
 xxxg1037xxx  can bind  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx   xxxg163xxx , a component of dynein motor
complex, and act as a bridge between the dynein motors
and the ubiquitination process, directing the polyubiquitinated proteins to aggresome.  xxxg1037xxx  has a
high afﬁnity for ubiquitin molecule (due to the presence
of the znf-ubp or buz domain) and is involved in the
transport of poly-ubiquitinated proteins (boyault et al.,
2006).  xxxg1037xxx  deacetylase activity is important for
transport of misfolded poly-ubiquitinated proteins to
the aggresome, and loss of  xxxg1037xxx  function makes cells
more sensitive to misfolded protein stress induced by
protease inhibitor and, as a consequence, cell death
(kawaguchi et al., 2003).
hdaci inhibits angiogenesis
hdaci can block tumor angiogenesis by inhibition
of hypoxia inducible factors (hif) (liang et al.,
2006). hif-1 and hif-2 are transcription factors for

mechanisms of histone deacetylase inhibitors
ws xu et al

5547

angiogenic genes (brown and wilson, 2004). the oxygen
level can control hif activity through two mechanisms.
first, under normoxic conditions,  xxxg1048xxx  binds to von
hippel–lindau protein ( xxxg2415xxx ) and is degraded by the
ubiquitination–proteasome system. second, hif activity depends on its transactivation potential (tap),
which is affected by the interaction with the coactivator
p300/cbp among others. this complex can be disrupted
by factor inhibiting hif (fih). hypoxic conditions
activate hif through repression of the hydroxylases
responsible for hif degradation and loss of function.
hypoxia is a common event in tumors. hypoxic
conditions can induce transcription activation of
hdac1, -2 and -3 in transformed cells (liang et al.,
2006). these class i hdacs downregulate expression of
p53 and  xxxg2415xxx , which reduces fih expression and
consequently activates  xxxg1048xxx  and promotes angiogenesis (liang et al., 2006).
tsa,  xxxd3529xxx , fk228, butyrate and  xxxd1797xxx  were
found to repress angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and
reduce expression of pro-angiogenesis factors, including
 xxxg1048xxx  and vegf (deroanne et al., 2002; bolden et al.,
2006; liang et al., 2006). hdaci can induce  xxxg1048xxx 
degradation by acetylation at lys532, leading to the
interaction with, and ubiquitination by  xxxg2415xxx  (jeong
et al., 2002). further, hdaci can induce  xxxg1048xxx 
degradation in a vhl-independent mechanism (kong
et al., 2006). class ii hdacs,  xxxg1036xxx  or  xxxg1037xxx ,
physically associate with  xxxg1048xxx , and their selective
inhibition by sirna induced  xxxg1048xxx  degradation (qian
et al., 2006). moreover,  xxxg1048xxx  binds to hsp90, and
hdaci can disrupt hsp90 chaperone function, exposing  xxxg1048xxx  to proteasomal degradation. these observations suggest that  xxxg1037xxx  should be inhibited for an
effective abolishment of  xxxg1048xxx  function.
another mechanism by which hdaci disrupt  xxxg1048xxx  function is through repression of its tap. low doses
of hdaci, which did not induce  xxxg1048xxx  degradation,
did repress  xxxg1048xxx  tap under both normoxic and
hypoxic conditions (fath et al., 2006). this repression
occurs due to the targeting of  xxxg1048xxx /p300 complex by
hdaci. hdaci could also decrease  xxxg1048xxx  activation
by inhibiting  xxxg1038xxx  activity, since under hypoxic
conditions,  xxxg1038xxx  translocates to the nucleus, where it
can interact with  xxxg1048xxx  and increase its transcriptional
activity (kato et al., 2004).
hdaci inhibit angiogenesis by preventing endothelial cells from responding to the angiogenic
stimulus generated by vegf (deroanne et al., 2002).
tsa and  xxxd3529xxx  inhibit vegf-induced expression
of vegf receptors and  xxxg1608xxx , and induction of
semaphoring iii expression in endothelial cells. the
anti-angiogenic effects of hdaci can contribute their
antitumor activities. these observations support the use
of combination therapies with vegf inhibitors.

including chemotherapeutic drugs, new targeted therapeutic reagents and radiation, by various mechanisms,
some unique for particular combinations (rosato and
grant, 2004; bhalla, 2005; marks and dokmanovic,
2005; bolden et al., 2006).
hdaci have shown synergy with chemotherapeutic
agents, such as antimetabolites 5-ﬂuorodeoxyuridine
and gemcitabine, antitubule agents docetaxel and
 xxxd2854xxx , topoisomerase (topo) ii inhibitors
doxorubicin,  xxxd2008xxx ,  xxxd2068xxx  (etopside) and ellipticine
(munster et al., 2001; kim et al., 2003b), and dna
crosslinking agent cisplatin (kim et al., 2003b). the
synergistic effects may depend on the sequence of
drug administration. for example, prior treatment
with hdaci induced chromatin decondensation and
increased topo iib/dna cleavable complex formation,
resulting in synergy of hdaci plus  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors
(marchion et al., 2005). the reverse order of administration of the drugs resulted in antagonistic effects,
or had no more effect than each drug alone (kim et al.,
2003b). further, pretreament with hdaci had
more effect (four times) than the reverse (1.8 times) in
the combination with cisplatin, although the reverse
was not antagonistic (kim et al., 2003b). hdaci have
also been reported to have synergy with transcription
modulator all-trans retinoid acids,  xxxd1682xxx  and its
analogs,
dna
demethylating
agent
5-aza20  xxxd1836xxx , abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (gleevec,
sti571) in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) cells, hsp90
inhibitor 17-ally-amino-demethoxy  xxxd2187xxx , proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( xxxd357xxx ), trastuzumab
(herceptin), which is a monoclonal antibody against
 xxxg721xxx  (erbb2) receptor, and radiotherapy
(nimmanapalli et al., 2003; marks and dokmanovic,
2005; bolden et al., 2006).
upregulation of death receptors and/or reducing the
inhibitory regulators of death receptor pathway by
hdaci sensitize tumor cells to trail (bolden et al.,
2006). hdaci also achieve synergy with trail by
simultaneous activation of the intrinsic and the extrinsic
apoptotic pathways, without changing the expression of
trail receptors or the inhibitory protein  xxxg436xxx 
(rosato and grant, 2004).
many kinase inhibitors, including cdk inhibitor
ﬂavopyridol, phosphatidylinocitol 3 kinase inhibitor
 xxxd2523xxx ,  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2642xxx  and  xxxg1361xxx /2
inhibitor  xxxd1688xxx , suppress hdaci-mediated p21
induction, and potentiate the cell killing effect of
hdaci. blocking  xxxg1559xxx  activation by i kappa b
alpha ( xxxg1561xxx ) phosphorylation inhibitor bay 11-7082
markedly increase hdaci-induced apoptosis (almenara et al., 2002; rosato and grant, 2005).
clinical development of hdaci

combination of hdaci with other antitumor agents
the hdaci have shown synergistic or additive antitumor effects with a wide range of antitumor reagents,

the studies with tumor bearing animals and
clinical trials of hdaci have been extensively reviewed
elsewhere (rosato and grant, 2004; bhalla, 2005;
marks and dokmanovic, 2005; bolden et al., 2006;
oncogene

mechanisms of histone deacetylase inhibitors
ws xu et al

5548

marks and breslow, 2007) (table 2).  xxxd3529xxx  is the
ﬁrst of the new hdaci to be approved by food and
drug administration for the clinical use in cancer
patients, namely the treatment of cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ) (duvic et al., 2007; garber, 2007).
in a phase ii study with orally administered  xxxd3529xxx 
on 33 previously treated patients with refractory
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, partial response were
observed in eight patients (24.2%) and 14 of 31
evaluable patients (45.2%) had pruritis relief (duvic
et al., 2007).
at least 14 different hdaci are in some phase
of clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination
with retinoids, taxols, gemcitabine, radiation, etc, in
patients with hematologic and solid tumors, including
cancer of lung, breast, pancreas, renal and bladder,
melanoma, glioblastoma, leukemias, lymphomas,
multiple myeloma (see national cancer institute website for  xxxd3432xxx  clinical trials,  xxxd3432xxx .cancer.gov or clinicaltrials.gov, and website of companies developing
hdaci; table 2).

the resistance to hdaci
development of resistance to hdaci is a major
concern as with any new antitumor therapy. in
preclinical studies, resistance to hdaci-induced
transformed cell death was observed in human bladder
carcinoma cells (t24) and prostate cancer cells
( xxxg1682xxx ) (butler et al., 2000; richon et al., 2000; xu
et al., 2006). although  xxxd3529xxx  achieved 24.2%
response rate in a phase ii trial on  xxxg2343xxx , a considerable
proportion of patients with  xxxg2343xxx  did not respond
well (duvic et al., 2007). resistance has been observed in
clinical trials with other hdaci in different tumors.
the basis of resistance to hdaci is not well understood. high levels of bcl-2 (pommier et al., 2004),
trx (powis et al., 2000) and peroxiredoxins (chung
et al., 2001) have been associated with resistance
of transformed cells to chemotherapy, and may
play a role in the resistance to hdaci. upregulation
of trx protects normal cells against hdaci-induced
cell death (ungerstedt et al., 2005). overexpression
of bcl-2 blocks hdaci-induced transformed cell death
(mitsiades et al., 2003). peroxiredoxins reduce
ros generation (kang et al., 1998) and may protect
transformed cells from hdaci-induced cell death,
which is strongly associated with ros production
(rosato and grant, 2005). resistance to fk228
has been associated with multiple drug resistance,
upregulation of and efﬂux by  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  ( xxxg10xxx ) (glaser,
2006). the  xxxg10xxx -mediated resistance does not affect
 xxxd3529xxx  (rueﬂi et al., 2002).

conclusions and perspectives
hdacs have multiple substrates involved in many
biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation,
oncogene

apoptosis and other forms of cell death. indeed, the fact
that hdacs have histone and multiple nonhistone
protein substrates suggests these enzymes should be
referred to as ‘lysine deacetylases’. hdaci can
cause transformed cells to undergo growth arrest,
differentiation and/or cell death. normal cells are
relatively resistant to hdaci. hdaci are selective
in altering gene expression, which may reﬂect, in part,
the proteins composing the transcription factor
complex to which hdacs are recruited. both
altered gene expression and changes in non-histone
proteins caused by hdaci-induced acetylation play
a role in the antitumor activity of hdaci. this
is reﬂected in the different inducer-activated antitumor pathways in transformed cells (figure 1).
the functions of hdacs are not redundant. thus,
a pan-hdac inhibitor such as  xxxd3529xxx  may
activate more antitumor pathways and have therapeutic advantages compared to hdac isotype-speciﬁc
inhibitors.
almost all cancers have multiple defects in the
expression and/or structure of proteins that regulate
cell proliferation and death. compared to other antitumor reagents, the plurality of action of hdaci
potentially confers efﬁcacy in a wide spectrum of
cancers, which have heterogeneity and multiple defects,
both among different types of cancer and within
different individual tumors of the same type. the
multiple defects in a cancer cell may be the reason for
transformed cells being more sensitive than normal cells
to hdaci. thus, given the relatively rapid reversibility
of  xxxd3529xxx  inhibition of hdacs, normal cells may be
able to compensate for hdaci-induced changes more
effectively than cancer cells.
hdaci have synergistic or additive antitumor effects
with many other antitumor reagents – suggesting that
combination of hdaci and other anticancer agents
may be very attractive therapeutic strategies for using
these agents. complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the resistance and sensitivity to hdaci
has obvious therapeutic importance. targeting resistant
factors will enhance the antitumor efﬁcacy of hdaci.
identifying markers that can predict response to hdaci
is a high priority for expanding the efﬁcacy of these
novel anticancer agents.
