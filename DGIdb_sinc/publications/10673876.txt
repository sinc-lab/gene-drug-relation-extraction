we have investigated the effect of treatment with  xxxd3410xxx , an inhibitor of fibrinolysis,
on blood loss, blood transfusion requirements and blood coagulation in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study of 42 patients after total knee arthroplasty.  xxxd3410xxx 
15 mg kg–1 (n521) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (n521) was given 30 min before
surgery and subsequently every 8 h for 3 days. coagulation and fibrinolysis values, blood loss
and blood units administered were measured before administration of tranexamic  xxxd2008xxx  h
after the end of surgery and at 24 and 72 h after operation. coagulation profile was examined
(bleeding time, platelet count, prothrombin time (pt), activated partial thromboplastin time
(aptt), plasminogen, beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinogen). fibrinolysis was evaluated by measurement of concentrations of d-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (fdp). total blood
loss in the  xxxd3410xxx  group was 678 (sd 352) ml compared with 1419 (607) ml in the
control group (p,0.001), and occurred primarily during the first 24 h after surgery. thirteen
patients received 1–5 u. of packed red blood cells in the control group compared with two
patients in the  xxxd3410xxx  group, who received 3 u. (p,0.001). postoperative packed cell
volume values were higher in the  xxxd3410xxx  group despite fewer blood transfusions.
postoperative concentrations of plasminogen were decreased significantly in the tranexamic
acid group (p,0.001). platelet count, pt, aptt, bleeding time, beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinogen
and fdp concentrations did not differ between groups, but d-dimer concentrations were
increased in the control group. thromboembolic complications occurred in two patients in
the control group compared with none in the  xxxd3410xxx  group.

total knee arthroplasty is associated with minimal intraoperative, but extensive postoperative, blood loss. both
surgery and application of a pneumatic tourniquet are
reported to enhance coagulability and the local fibrinolytic
activity in the limb.1–5 increased plasma concentrations of
coagulation factors, reduced concentrations of coagulation
inhibitors, enhanced platelet activity, endovascular release
of catecholamines and serotonin contribute to haemostasis.
the fibrinolytic system is activated when tissue trauma
releases tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ). thrombin also
activates fibrinolysis by triggering release of  xxxg1766xxx  from the
vascular endothelial cells.6 7  xxxg1766xxx  is the major enzyme
responsible for conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.
surgical stress enhances the release of plasmin at the site
of vascular damage and, in orthopaedic surgery, the use of
a tourniquet increases further fibrinolytic activity.8 this
may contribute to blood loss after total knee arthroplasty,

although after surgery, the fibrinolytic system shuts down
as a consequence of increased release of plasminogen
activator inhibitor that inactivates  xxxg1766xxx .8 9
apart from technical operative measures, antifibrinolytic
agents may improve haemostasis and reduce blood loss.
 xxxd3410xxx , a synthetic inhibitor of fibrinolysis, competitively blocks a lysine binding site of plasminogen.
plasminogen– xxxd3410xxx  complexes are displaced from
the surface of fibrin and, as plasmin is prevented from
binding to fibrinogen or fibrin monomers, lysis is delayed.10
at higher concentrations,  xxxd3410xxx  also acts as a
non-competitive inhibitor of plasmin.11 12
despite several clinical studies proving the efficacy of
 xxxd3410xxx  with single or multiple boluses of different
sizes with or without subsequent infusions, no consensus
has been reached on the dose of  xxxd3410xxx  to be
administered or duration of treatment.2 4 13–15 previous

studies established the therapeutic plasma concentrations of
 xxxd3410xxx   xxxd1891xxx  ng ml–1 16 and the need for an 80%
reduction in the activity of plasminogen activator for
suppression of fibrinolysis in tissues.17 an i.v. dose of
 xxxd3410xxx  10 mg kg–1 maintains such plasma concentration for only 3 h.18 this may be insufficient to prevent
postoperative bleeding in prosthetic knee surgery and thus
is an argument for using higher doses. furthermore, there
are indications that local enhancement of fibrinolysis elicited
by application of a tourniquet may affect haemostasis for
a considerably longer time than the surgical procedure.15
thus it may be beneficial to maintain antifibrinolytic treatment for several days.
in studies related to knee surgery,2 13–15  xxxd3410xxx 
was administered just before release of the tourniquet. as
tourniquet inflation stimulates the fibrinolytic system,1 8 we
found it more logical to start administration of tranexamic
acid before the tourniquet was inflated.
in this study, we have investigated, in a homogeneous
healthy population undergoing total knee arthroplasty, if
administration of a high dose of  xxxd3410xxx  for 3 days
influences blood loss and has a blood-sparing effect. in
addition, we assessed the mechanism of action of tranexamic
acid on coagulation and fibrinolysis.

patients and methods
the study was approved by the university ethics
committee and written informed consent was obtained
from each patient. we studied 42 asa i–iii patients,
diagnosed with osteoarthrosis and undergoing unilateral
bicondylar cemented total knee arthroplasty. exclusion
criteria were known allergy to  xxxd3410xxx , preoperative hepatic or renal dysfunction, serious cardiac or
respiratory disease, congenital or acquired coagulopathy or
a history of, or evolving, thromboembolic disease. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication was discontinued at
least 24 h before surgery. thromboprophylaxis was given
routinely in every patient with low-molecular weight heparin
(fraxiparin, sanofi-winthrop, france), starting the day
before surgery and continuing until hospital discharge, as
performed routinely by the department of orthopaedics.
patients were allocated randomly to receive tranexamic
acid 15 mg kg–1 ( xxxd3410xxx , bournonville pharma, belgium)
or an equal volume of saline, in a double-blind manner,
30 min before inflation of the tourniquet and surgery, and
repeated subsequently every 8 h for 3 days. both the
surgeon and anaesthetist were blinded to the treatment
regimen.
general anaesthesia was induced with propofol
1–1.5 mg kg–1, vecuronium 0.1 mg kg–1 and fentanyl
0.1 mg, and maintained with isoflurane and a 40%
mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide, with increments
of fentanyl. during surgery, patients received ringer’s
solution at a rate of 4 ml kg–1 h–1 for compensation of
insensible fluid losses and measured blood losses were

replaced with a modified fluid gelatin solution (geloplasma)
and crystalloids (ringer’s solution) in equal volumes.
arterial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration,
oesophageal temperature and pulse oximetry were measured
continuously.
to prevent intraoperative blood loss, a pneumatic
tourniquet was inflated after the leg had been elevated for
5 min. an esmarch bandage was not used for exsanguination
of the limb. the tourniquet was released at the end of
surgery when a compressive dressing was applied and the
blood drainage system functioned correctly. each arthroplasty was performed by the same surgeon using a standard
technique. an insall/burstein ii modular knee system,
posterior stabilized series (zimmer, indiana, usa), was
implanted in all patients using palacos r bone cement with
gentamicin (schering-plough sa, belgium). in each knee,
two intra-articular drains and one subcutaneous drain
were placed.
blood loss was measured by weighing swabs and
operative drapes and measuring the volumes in the suction
bottles after surgery, and then by checking the drain
collectors on admission to the post-anaesthesia care unit
(pacu) and every 8 h thereafter for 3 days until the surgical
drains were removed. patients remained in the pacu for
the first 8 h after operation.
homologous blood transfusions given during the whole
hospital stay were recorded for quantity and time of
administration. the indication for postoperative transfusion
was set at a packed cell volume (pcv) of less than 26%
in any of the postoperative measures.
bleeding time, estimated using the ivy method (simplate
i, organon teknika, turnhout, belgium) and concentrations
of alt, ast and creatinine were measured before operation
and venous blood samples were obtained before surgery,
8 h after arrival in the pacu and at 24 and 72 h after
operation. blood samples were analysed for haemoglobin
concentration, pcv, platelet count, prothrombin time (pt)
and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), and concentrations of beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinogen, plasminogen,
d-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (fdp).
plasminogen was measured in plasma using the il test
plasminogen kit in which plasminogen is converted to a
plasminogen–streptokinase complex having a plasmin-like
activity. this activity is detected by a chromogenic substrate.
the method is linear in the range 15–120% of plasminogen.
standard laboratory techniques were used for all other
assays. all samples were assayed in duplicate. all patients
were examined daily for signs of deep venous thrombosis
(dvt).
randomization was performed using a computergenerated random number list. fisher’s exact test and the
chi-square test were used for the fdp and d-dimer data
sets and to compare qualitative variables. the temporal
evolution of the biological variables was evaluated using a
repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by a post
hoc analysis using the newman–keuls test if a total time

effect was significant. if values were missing, groups were
compared using the mann–whitney u test and different
times were compared successively with preoperative values
using the wilcoxon signed rank test. bonferroni correction
was applied to avoid statistical error induced by multiplication of the tests. spearman’s test was used for non-parametric
correlation analysis. results are expressed as mean (sd).
p,0.05 for two-tailed tests was considered significant.

results
the two groups were comparable in age, height, body
weight, sex, preoperative concentrations of creatinine, ast
and alt, operative time and duration of tourniquet inflation
(table 1).
total mean blood loss measured at 72 h was 678 (352)
ml (range 40–1560 ml) in the  xxxd3410xxx  group and
1419 (607) ml (range 675–3020 ml) in the control group
(table 2). blood loss on discharge from the pacu was
reduced by 58% in the  xxxd3410xxx  group (p,0.001).
cumulative postoperative blood losses between 24 and 72 h
were 32% lower in the  xxxd3410xxx  group than in the
control group (211 (123) ml vs 308 (139) ml, respectively;
p,0.03).
the need for blood transfusion was greater in the control
group, with 13 of 21 patients requiring a mean of 1.5 u.
(range 1–5), compared with only two of 21 patients in the
 xxxd3410xxx  group, who received 3 u. each. the total
amount of blood transfused in each group was 15.7 litre in
the control group and 2.9 litre in the  xxxd3410xxx  group.
the relative risk of blood transfusion was 2.9 times higher
in the control group than in the  xxxd3410xxx  group (95%
confidence interval 1.6–5.4).

preoperative haemoglobin values were significantly
greater in the  xxxd3410xxx  group compared with the
control group (p,0.05). however, when haemoglobin
concentration was compared separately for males and
females between the two groups, the difference was no
longer statistically significant (p50.41 male; p50.06
female). all other preoperative haematological, coagulation
and fibrinolysis variables were comparable between groups
(tables 3, 4). compared with respective preoperative values,
mean haemoglobin concentration decreased significantly in
both groups at each postoperative assessment. on the first
postoperative day, haemoglobin concentration, expressed as
a fraction of the preoperative value, was significantly lower
in the control patients than in the  xxxd3410xxx  group
(75 (8)% vs 83 (6)%, respectively; p,0.01) and reflected
the difference in blood loss. at 72 h, there were no
differences between groups. pcv decreased to a greater
extent in the control group at 24 h after operation.
platelet count, bleeding time and beta-thromboglobulin
concentrations were similar in both groups, with a slight
decrease in platelet count, a significantly lower beta-thromboglobulin concentration at 24 h in the control group and no
major differences in bleeding time. postoperative fibrinogen
concentrations increased significantly in the  xxxd3410xxx 
group and in the control group at 72 h after operation, with
no significant differences between groups.
there were no clinically relevant differences in aptt
or pt (table 4). plasminogen concentrations decreased
noticeably with time in the  xxxd3410xxx  group only
(p,0.001).
peak fdp concentrations (.40 µg ml–1) were found in
one patient in each group on the day of surgery. the
 xxxd3410xxx  group had significantly lower d-dimer
concentrations on discharge from the pacu and at 24 h
after operation than the control group (p,0.001). eight
patients in the control group had concentrations exceeding
200 ng ml–1 while this occurred in only two patients in the
 xxxd3410xxx  group. there was no relationship between
d-dimer concentrations and the extent of blood loss, but
there were significant correlations between blood loss during
the first 24 h and fibrinogen concentrations in both groups
( xxxd3410xxx  group r5–0.349, p,0.02; control group
r5–0.397, p,0.01) and with plasminogen concentrations
in the  xxxd3410xxx  group only (r50.472, p,0.002).
there were no thromboembolic complications in the
 xxxd3410xxx  group. in the control group, one patient
had a proven dvt 4 days after operation and another
12 days after surgery; both incidents were confirmed by
phlebography.

discussion
we have evaluated the use of  xxxd3410xxx  given
during total knee arthroplasty and for the first 3 days after
operation.  xxxd3410xxx  decreased blood loss by 48%
and significantly reduced transfusion requirements. the

blood-sparing effect of  xxxd3410xxx  was most evident
during the first 24 h after operation when blood loss was
significantly reduced compared with the control group.
despite the larger amounts of blood transfused, pcv
remained lower in the control group 24 h after operation.
the degree of blood loss during the first 24 h correlated
significantly with both fibrinogen and plasminogen concentrations in the  xxxd3410xxx  group but with only
fibrinogen in the control group.
 xxxd3410xxx  (trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane
carboxylic acid) inhibits the conversion of inactive
plasminogen to the active proteolytic enzyme plasmin by
competitive blocking of a high affinity lysine binding site
of plasminogen. this prevents plasmin from binding to
fibrinogen and fibrin structures after clot formation. the
drug is a weak non-competitive inhibitor of plasmin.11
fibrinolytic activation is a cascade process that is most
easily inhibited in its earlier phase, which may explain why
 xxxd3410xxx  has little effect when given after heavy
blood loss.19 20
despite the efficacy of  xxxd3410xxx  for reducing
bleeding, no direct correlation was found between blood
loss and variables of fibrinolysis (d-dimer, fdp). as
 xxxd3410xxx  inhibits the transformation of plasminogen
into active plasmin, a higher plasma concentration of

plasminogen could be expected in this treatment group.
however, as in the study of benoni, lethagen and fredin,21
plasminogen concentrations were significantly lower after
surgery in the  xxxd3410xxx  group than in the placebo
group (p,0.001). it is known that  xxxd3410xxx 
interferes with assay of plasminogen and decreases
measured plasminogen concentrations by 16%.21 but the
reduction in plasminogen concentrations observed in our
patients was much larger (range 17–66% vs preoperative
values). reduced plasminogen concentrations may represent
contributory evidence of enhanced fibrinolysis. however,
we considered this unlikely. if decreased plasminogen
indicates enhanced conversion to plasmin and exaggerated
fibrin degradation with consumption of fibrin and to a
lesser extent fibrinogen, an attendant increase in serum
concentrations of fdp and decreased concentrations of
fibrinogen would be expected. in contrast, tranexamic acidtreated patients showed no bleeding tendency, increased
fibrinogen concentrations and no increase in fdp concentrations.
we also found significantly fewer patients with increased
d-dimer concentrations in the  xxxd3410xxx  group.
increased concentrations of d-dimer in the control group
during the first 24 h after operation indirectly support the
antifibrinolytic effect of  xxxd3410xxx . d-dimer con-

centrations reflect degradation of fibrin when plasmin acts
on cross-linked fibrin and are not a direct indicator of
plasmin activity. a decrease in d-dimer and fdp concentrations in plasma was also reported after  xxxd3410xxx 
treatment in cardiac surgery4 where more intense fibrinolytic
activation occurs.22
our data confirmed that  xxxd3410xxx  did not induce
platelet activation.23 24 indeed, platelet count and beta thromboglobulin, a marker of platelet activation, were similar in
both groups and decreased at 24 h after operation, while
bleeding time was unaffected. a platelet-sparing effect of
 xxxd3410xxx  was not found. the amount of modified
fluid gelatin used never exceeded 500 ml in 24 h and should
therefore have no significant effect on platelet function.
extrinsic coagulation (pt) and the intrinsic pathway of
coagulation (aptt) were unaffected by  xxxd3410xxx  and
varied within their reference limits, indicating that the
observed blood loss was not caused by any major deficit
in coagulation factors.
is the timing of the initial dose of  xxxd3410xxx 
crucial? in our study,  xxxd3410xxx  was given before
inflation of the tourniquet. application of a pneumatic
tourniquet enhances fibrinolysis as a result of plasminogen
activator released from the vascular endothelium, triggered
by hypoxia or venous stasis.25–27 nevertheless, the reported
incidence of dvt after total knee replacement varies
from 40 to 84%.28–30 thrombi develop during tourniquet
inflation. concentrations of  xxxg784xxx  and thrombin–
 xxxg2056xxx  complexes (tat), which are circulating
indices of thrombin generation, are increased markedly
immediately after deflation of the tourniquet8 31 while
 xxxg1766xxx  activity increases during tourniquet inflation and is
already decreased 1 h after surgery. starting an antifibrinolytic treatment before tourniquet inflation could
interfere with the natural defence mechanisms of the
body against thrombosis formation. previous research on
 xxxd3410xxx  and thrombosis failed to show any
thrombogenic effect,13 14 32 but thrombotic complications
were reported with therapy exceeding 24 h.33 34 investigation
of clot stability by thrombelastography may have demonstrated evidence of increased fibrinolysis after use of the
tourniquet in the control group and its absence in the
 xxxd3410xxx  group. in our study, there were no thromboembolic complications in the  xxxd3410xxx  group, but
two patients in the control group had a dvt. it has been
reported that increased plasma concentrations of tat and
d-dimer correlate with thrombotic tendency.35 although we
have no data on tat, decreased d-dimer concentrations
could be an indication of reduced risk of dvt in the
 xxxd3410xxx  group, but our study was not designed with
sufficient power to detect differences in the incidence of
dvt. treatment with  xxxd3410xxx  before inflation of
the tourniquet did not seem to augment the risk of dvt,
but this could be attributable to the additional protection
offered by low-molecular weight heparin given for
thrombosis prophylaxis in all patients.

in summary,  xxxd3410xxx , given over 72 h after
operation, was effective in reducing blood loss and transfusion needs after prosthetic knee surgery. inflation of the
tourniquet after administration of a bolus dose of tranexamic
acid did not augment the risk of thrombogenesis. a dose
regimen of 15 mg kg–1 every 8 h for 24 h would seem
appropriate as longer administration of  xxxd3410xxx  was
not accompanied by further reductions in blood loss.
