from the zinc-bound water and transferring it to buffer b in
solution. the most prominent acceptor in y64h cavc has a
pk, near 9.2; in fact, kcatvalues for this mutant andca vc are
identical at ph >8 (fig. 4). thus, it canbe concluded that this
proton acceptor is not t y r 6 4 , but another residue near thezinc.
at ph <7, the values of kc,, for this mutant exceed those for
cavcby as much as 5-fold and show a second pk, near 6.2
with a maximum near lo4 s-' (fig. 4). this suggests a possible
proton acceptor role of his64in y64h ca vc; his64is a proton
acceptor in hcai1 (tu et al., 1989) and in k64h hcai11
(jewell et al., 1991). however, in hca 11, the presence of his64
supports proton transfer to give a maximal value of kcat near
lo6 s-'; in y64h cavc, this maximal value appears to be
closer t o lo4 s-'. thus, the replacement tyr'j4 + his in cavc
does not result inkeatvalues similarto those for ca 11, and the
presence of typ4 is not a major factor in the unique kinetic
properties of ca v.
a comparison of the maximal values of the steady-state kinetic constants for the hydrationof co, appears intable i. the
maximal steady-stateparameters for ca vresemble most
closely those for ca i. it isuseful to note that previous reports
of human ca v as a low activity enzyme (nagao et al., 1993;
their value is not a specific activity) and of a turnover number
of 24,000 s-' for rat cav (dodgson and cherian, 1989) referto
ph near 7.4; at more alkaline ph, the activity is appreciable
and not a low activity carbonic anhydrase. this may be significant since intramitochondrial ph is expected to be alkaline.
the inhibition ofcavc by two prominent sulfonamides and
cyanate is very similar to thatof ca i1 (table 11).thus, itwill
not be possible to differentiate between ca i1 and v in physiological function using these sulfonamides.
