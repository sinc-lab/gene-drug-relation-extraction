(laam) is a synthetic opioid analgesic with agonistic activity and a long duration of action.
there are several, almost exclusively us american studies showing the eﬃcacy of laam as a
maintenance drug which has the advantage that
it needs to be administered only three times a

countries due to cardiac complications. we
report on the first european multi-center, parallel group, flexible dose, open-label, randomized
clinical trial comparing laam and methadone in
patients with opioid dependence.

introduction
&
in spite of the widely accepted use of methadone
maintenance in opiate addiction [1, 27, 34, 42]
there are several drawbacks to this treatment.
daily dosing requires frequent attendance at a
clinic, which is cost-intensive and interrupts
daily activities. this is true especially for patients
with regular employment or who care for a
family. these complications can be alleviated by
dispensing methadone as a take-home dose,
however, this is one of the origins of an illicit
methadone market. there is also the risk of accidental intoxication, e.g., due to the use of takehome methadone dosages by small children
present in the family [4]. methadone doses do
not prevent withdrawal symptoms for the entire
24 h interdosing interval in approximately onethird of those in treatment [9, 10]. it can also be
euphorigenic shortly after intake due to a rapid
rise of blood levels [37], which is contradictory to

then randomly assigned to a methadone (n = 41)
or a laam (n = 43) group. study duration was 24
weeks after randomization. objective measures
(drug urine screenings, retention rate), subjective
measures (symptoms of withdrawal and craving,
report of substance use), and safety data were
collected weekly. the main outcome criterion
was the number of opiate-free urine samples per
number of weeks of study participation.
results: non-inferiority was shown for laam
compared to methadone. both substances were
well tolerated. there were no clinical cardiac
complications in either group.
discussion: our study confirmed the results
of previous investigations with laam as being
eﬃcacious and well tolerated in opioid dependence. a discussion to reconsider the availability
of laam is recommended.

an optimal maintenance medication for opioid
dependence. a longer acting opioid would be
more advantageous for maintenance treatment.
levo-alpha- xxxd2588xxx  (laam) was developed in 1948. traditionally, it was understood as
a prodrug with the metabolites  xxxd2475xxx  and
dinor-laam, both of which are more potent than
laam. other studies have shown that laam
itself may have comparable potency to methadone [11, 51]. the significance that the long duration of action would be beneficial for maintenance
treatment became clear in the 1970s. several
studies [2, 14, 21, 22, 24, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34–36, 40,
44, 46, 47, 52] and two meta-analyses [6, 16] have
been performed comparing laam to methadone
in maintenance treatment: “laam appears more
eﬀective than methadone at reducing heroin use”
[6]. the studies were conducted exclusively in
north america, with the exception of one australian study [44]. it is impossible to generalize
the results of the north american trials as the

health care and welfare systems in the us are so diﬀerent from
those in most european countries. we report on the first multicenter, parallel group, flexible dose, open-label, randomized
european study comparing laam to methadone in opioid
dependence.

patients and methods
&
patients
for this study men and non-pregnant, non-nursing women with
opioid dependence according to icd-10 criteria were recruited.
candidates for the study had to have been in methadone maintenance treatment for at least one month prior to screening.
patients with severe hepatic, other somatic or psychiatric disease, unstable methadone dose during the last two weeks before
screening or during the run-in phase, dependence on drugs
other than heroin, a positive pregnancy test, or younger than 18
years of age were excluded. all patients were informed about the
benefits and risks involved in the study procedures and signed
an informed consent. the trial was endorsed and supervised by
the bundesinstitut für arzneimittel und medizinprodukte (german federal institute for drugs and medical devices, project no.
430 48 20) and approved by all local ethics committees.
centers involved in recruiting patients were a university outpatient clinic, two public maintenance clinics and a private practice specializing in the treatment of drug addicts. all centers
employ health professionals and social workers. there was usually one patient contact with a professional per week beside that
of dispensing medication. there were no single or group psychotherapy sessions while the study was in progress.

methods
the study consisted of three phases (䊉䉴 fig. 1): screening
(week − 5), run-in (weeks − 4 to − 1), and randomized treatment
period of 24 weeks. eligibility of the candidate was determined
during the screening phase. all patients received methadone
during the run-in phase: the methadone dosage was determined
from the daily dose during the last two weeks before the study
began and had to remain stable during the entire run-in period.
patients who were eligible to enter the study at day 1 of the runin phase were randomized into one of two groups according to a
central randomization procedure. there was no stratification of
randomization by race, sex, or any other factors. group 1 continued to receive methadone under the same conditions as in the
run-in phase, with the exception that dosage adjustments were
allowed. group 2 received laam on mondays, wednesdays and
fridays. switching from methadone to laam was done abruptly.
on mondays and wednesdays, laam dosage was 1.3-fold the

study design.

last daily methadone dose, on fridays 1.6-fold. one week after
baseline, dosages could be adjusted freely according to clinical
needs by the treating physician as long as the upper limit (methadone: 100 mg/die, laam: 130 mg on mondays and wednesdays, 160 mg on fridays) was not exceeded. isolated adjustment
of the friday laam dose was possible.
take-home doses were allowed in the methadone group under
the condition that patients had been in methadone maintenance
for at least six months without any use of illegal drugs. patients
with take-home methadone were required to come to the clinic
on monday, wednesday and friday to comply with the required
number of randomized urine drug screens, alcohol testing and
interviews. take-home doses were not allowed in the laam
group. if a patient in the methadone group did not come to the
clinic for more than two consecutive days, s/he received only 2/3
of the previous methadone dose and it was gradually increased
in the following days. after missing five or six days, the dose was
reduced by 1/2 and then gradually increased. if a patient missed
seven or more days, they were excluded from the study. the
dose in the laam group was reduced by 2/3 after missing two
visits, and patients were excluded after missing 3 visits.
patients were seen at least once a week by an investigator. vital
signs and safety data were collected and patients were investigated as follows:
§ the addiction severity index (american version: asi, european version: europasi) [19, 38] is an index of frequency and
quantity of drug and alcohol use as well as of associated consequences for health and social status. the entire interview
was performed at screening, baseline, and weeks + 12 and + 24.
the section “drug and alcohol use” was completed once a
week. composite scores were determined for each section
using both the american and the european versions.
§ the clinical global impressions scale, german version (cgi),
which reflects the physician’s perception of disease severity
and improvement compared to baseline [7, 39].
§ three self-assessment scales: the subjective opiate withdrawal scale (german version: soes; weekly), a visual analog
scale (vas; weekly) regarding heroin craving, and the scl-90r, german version (weeks − 2, + 6, + 12, + 19, + 24) [8, 13].
§ patients had to deliver two urine samples per week for toxicology screens according to a randomized schedule. one of
these was randomly passed on to the laboratory. urine was
collected in tamper-proof containers (premier diagnostics,
formerly franklin diagnostics corp., morristown, new jersey), and urine temperatures were recorded. the treating
physician was informed of the results regardless of treatment
group.
§ the women had a pregnancy test once a week.

secondary objectives
the following secondary indicators of eﬃcacy were derived from
urine samples screened for opiates:
§ “dirty rate”: the number of opiate-positive urine screenings
divided by the number of weeks of study participation. missing values were replaced as described for the free rate. this
index is complementary to the main eﬃcacy criterion.
§ “actual free rate”: the number of opiate-free urine screens
divided by the number of urine screens actually analyzed
without a replacement of missing values. a marked diﬀerence
between this indicator and the free rate would indicate a
major influence of the missing data replacement procedure.
§ treatment eﬀectiveness score (tes): the number of opiatefree urine samples divided by the intended number of weeks
of study treatment (24 weeks). this index [33] combines
information from the free rate and from the retention rate.
§ relapse rate: the proportion of patients with at least one opiate-positive finding during the observation period in the
whole treatment group.
§ time to relapse: number of days between baseline and occurrence of the first opiate-positive urine screening.
a combined variable was created regarding the use of non-opiates from the screening results for cannabis, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates, cocaine and amphetamines. this variable was set
to “positive” if the screening for any of these substances yielded
a positive result. a second combined variable was created comprising the consumption of non-opiates excluding cannabis. all
indices were computed for both variables as described for the
opiate screening (see above). a dirty rate and a free rate were
calculated for alcohol use but without a replacement of missing
values since the number of possible spirometric tests per week
ranged from 2 to 7. no treatment eﬀectiveness score could be
computed for the same reason.
the retention rate was defined as the proportion of patients who
completed the study regularly after 24 weeks in the entire treatment group. the following ratings, scales and questionnaires
were also regarded as secondary eﬃcacy parameters:
§ the cgi item “eﬃcacy”.
§ asi composite scores according to the american as well as
european standards.

§ the scl-90-r subscales and the scl-90-r global scores general symptomatic index, positive symptom total and positive
symptom distress index.
§ the subjective opiate withdrawal scale (german version:
soes).
§ the visual analog scale for heroin craving (vas).
assessment of tolerability and safety (global cgi rating of tolerability; frequency and severity of all drug-related adverse events)
were also secondary criteria in this trial.

statistics
in order to demonstrate that the therapeutic eﬃcacy of
treatment with laam is equal to or better than the eﬃcacy of
treatment with methadone, the study was designed as a “noninferiority trial” [15, 45].
the primary target variable (“free rate”) has a theoretical range
from 0 (no opiate-free urine at all assessments) to 1 (only opiate-free urine samples at all assessments). the equivalence
boundary was defined by  = − 0.1 points corresponding to a proportion of 10 % of drug-free urine samples. this was considered
as a clinically relevant diﬀerence of a comparator to methadone.
if it could be proven that the free rate in the laam group is not
less than 10 % compared to the methadone group, the hypothesis
of non-inferiority is accepted.
the hypotheses are described as follows:
laam or meth: expected value of the rate of opiate-free urine
samples within the up to 24 week treatment period after baseline (t0) under treatment of laam or methadone (meth).
test problem for demonstrating equivalence:
h0 : µ laam − µmeth < −0.1 vs. h1 : µlaam − µmeth ≥ −0.1
the null hypotheses h0 was examined with a two-sided (95.0 %)
confidence interval for laam–meth [3, 25]. to adjust for center
eﬀects, confidence intervals were calculated according to a proposal for stratified computation of confidence intervals suggested by lehmacher [30]. decisive for assuming non-inferiority
would be if the weighed confidence intervals include predefined
boundary of clinical relevant inferiority. significance levels are
only provided for illustrative purposes.
the eﬃcacy analysis was based on the intention to treat (itt)
population, which comprises all patients who took at least one
dose of medication after baseline.

results
&
a total of 106 patients was screened to participate in the study.
of all patients screened, 13 did not enter the run-in phase
because they refused participation (n = 5), had a significant
hepatic disorder (n = 3), or showed dependency on psychotropic
substances other than heroin (n = 2). other reasons were a severe
respiratory condition, pregnancy, or unstable dose of methadone (each n = 1). 93 patients entered the run-in phase (57 men
and 36 women; mean age 29.6 ± 6.2 years; range: 18–46 years).
84 participants were randomly assigned into one of the treatment groups. the patients suﬀered from long-term opiate addiction. demographic data are shown in 䊉䉴 table 1.
the retention rate over 24 weeks was 68 % in the methadone
group and 79 % in the laam group. reasons for drop-outs during
the run-in period and randomized treatment are shown in
䉴 table 2. the retention in treatment is shown in 䊉

§ there were at least twice weekly randomized spirometric
alcohol controls.
§ methadone and laam plasma levels were taken three times
during the trial to assure compliance.
§ laboratory and other safety data including ecg recordings
were retrieved at screening, baseline, and weeks + 12
and + 24.
laam was supplied as 5 mg and 40 mg soluble tablets, which
were added to approximately 150 ml of water and fruit juice.
methadone was supplied as 2 % solution of  xxxd2587xxx .
data were verified and analyzed by an independent research
firm. there were monthly monitoring visits with source data
verification and a public audit by the state health authorities.
the primary objective was the eﬃcacy of laam treatment in
comparison to treatment with methadone. the eﬃcacy was
assessed by the rate of opiate-free urine samples divided by the
number of weeks of study participation (“free rate”). missing
urine screenings were regarded as drug positive for the calculation if the patient was responsible, i.e., refused the sample or did
not come to the center, and negative if the investigator himself or
other circumstances had caused the missing value.

the mean treatment duration in the study was 135 ± 54 days in
the methadone group, and 150 ± 39 days in the laam group
(mean values not significantly diﬀerent, p = 0.17). the mean daily
dose of methadone during the run-in phase was 67 ± 26 mg in
the laam group and 70 ± 25 mg in the methadone group. the
average daily methadone dose was 69.5 ± 28.7 mg during the
controlled treatment phase. the average laam dose was
91 ± 31 mg on monday, 90 ± 30 mg on wednesday and 112 ± 36 mg
on friday: this was slightly increased on fridays and remained
stable on mondays and wednesdays.
dosage adjustments were performed in 70 % of laam patients
and 63 % of methadone patients, with a median of one adjustment in both groups [range: 1–14 (laam) and 1–10 (methadone)].

primary criterion of eﬃcacy
the free rate was 75 ± 28 % in the methadone group and 84 ± 25 %
in the laam group (itt population). the 2-sided 95 % confidence
interval for the 9 % diﬀerence in favour of laam was − 2.3 %
to + 20.3 % (2-tailed p = 0.118). these data show non-inferiority
of laam compared to methadone. for the per protocol (pp) population, the confidence interval was comparable: − 3.4 %
to + 20.0 % (2-tailed p = 0.162).

secondary criteria of eﬃcacy
a selection of results is shown in 䊉䉴 table 3. concomitant use of
non-opiates was comparable in both groups; alcohol consumption (as detected by breath alcohol testing) was negligible.
there were no diﬀerences found in the asi between groups with
the exception of a slight tendency in the subscale “physical condition” which improved in the laam but not the methadone
group. no relevant diﬀerences were found in the soes for with-

drawal symptoms or the vas for heroin craving. satisfaction
with treatment improved slightly in the laam group and worsened under methadone.
in the scl-90-r, average scores in the anger-hostility subscale
increased in the methadone group but decreased under laam
therapy (p = 0.0252). in the positive symptom distress index
(mean score for patients with symptoms), a favourable eﬀect of
laam (decrease of total severity score) compared to methadone
(increase) was found (p = 0.0472). no diﬀerences appeared in the
other subscales or indices.
in the cgi, improvement was found in 31.7 % of patients in the
methadone group and 32.5 % patients of the laam group,
whereas 14.6 % of the methadone patients and 11.6 % of the
laam patients worsened. the majority of patients remained
unchanged between baseline and endpoint.
the diﬀerence in secondary criteria of eﬃcacy between laam
and methadone was slightly more pronounced in women
(䊉䉴 table 4) and in patients without any relapse with illegal opiates during the run-in phase (䊉䉴 table 5). no trends were
observed for patients with take home allowance during run-in
(䊉䉴 table 6).

there were 95 aes in 52 patients during the run-in phase: 54
were classified as methadone-related. the most frequent were
an increase in sweating (24.4 % of all patients) and sleep disorders (20.0 % of all patients). 204 adverse events (aes) were documented in the controlled treatment phase in 68 patients. there
were 95 drug-related aes in 47 patients (m: 20, l: 27). the most
frequent were related to trial treatments: withdrawal symptoms
(m: 8, l: 13), increased sweating (m: 1, l: 7), sleep disorder (m:
2, l: 6) and nausea (m: 1, l: 6). severe intensity was attributed to
5 aes in the methadone group (drug abuse, abnormal hepatic
function, nausea, vomiting, withdrawal symptoms) and to 2 aes
in the laam group (somnolence, withdrawal symptoms).
slightly more adverse events occurred under laam than under
methadone treatment. a life-table analysis of the date of occurrence in the laam group showed that most aes occurred during
the first 6 weeks after switching treatment from methadone to
laam. ecg recordings showed a slight, but significant increase
of the qtc interval after week-long laam treatment compared
to baseline values under methadone, however, there were no
clinical cardiac complications in either group. ecg recordings
were analyzed in detail in a separate study (wieneke et al., submitted).
thirteen of all aes in both study phases were classified as serious (sae); 4 saes appeared during the run-in phase, 9 (m: 4, l:
5) during the controlled treatment phase. all saes were hospitalizations. one sae from each group was rated as “possibly
related to trial medication”. in both cases, additional use of illicit
drugs made detoxification necessary (m: benzodiazepines, l:
heroin). one sae from both groups was considered “unlikely” to
be related to trial medication (m: infected retroauricular wound
and swelling of lymph nodes; l: diabetes mellitus type ii). all
other saes were not related to the trial medication.
no safety risks were detected in the analyses of blood samples,
vital signs, physical examination data. a weight increase in the
laam group was not found in the methadone group.

discussion
&
several studies and two meta-analyses have been performed
comparing laam to methadone. in a cochrane review of publications until 2000 [6] all randomized trials, controlled trials and
controlled prospective studies comparing laam and methadone
for the treatment of heroin dependence and measuring outcomes of eﬃcacy or acceptability were included. the conclusion
was that laam appeared to be more eﬀective than methadone
at reducing heroin use; more laam patients stopped their allocated medication during the studies and no diﬀerence in general
safety was observed. another recent study showed laam to be
more eﬀective than methadone in promoting treatment retention and extended reduction in, and abstinence from opiate use
[2].
despite these results, laam has only been marketed in the usa
(since 1993) and several countries in the european union (denmark, germany, the netherlands, portugal, spain and the united
kingdom) since its approval in 1997 [6, 16, 41]. following several
cases of life-threatening arrhythmias in association with qt prolongation, the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal
products (emea) has recommended that marketing authorization should be withdrawn in europe and the u.s. food and drug
administration (fda) has recommended that laam should not
be used as a first-line therapy. jaﬀe [23] pointed out that both

methadone and laam can prolong the qt interval and that cardiac complications have been reported with both substances; he
concluded that laam should be available with proper screening
and ecg monitoring.
the maintenance therapy studies were performed almost exclusively in northern america. the present first multi-centre european study demonstrated that laam was non-inferior to
methadone regarding the main study criterion of eﬃcacy. several other secondary outcome measures showed a trend in
favour of laam compared to methadone (tes, scl-90-r, vas,
cgi), although none reached statistical significance. in previous
studies some elements may have favourably influenced outcomes of laam treatment, e.g., variability of laam dosing, the
presence of a methadone stabilization period before laam treatment, and the use of higher friday dosage [6, 16]. all of these
elements were included in our study and may have been the reason for the positive results in the laam group.
as in the recently published, large-scale study by anglin et al.
[2], our study was randomized, but treatment was not blinded.
this may be surprising for a prospective multi-centre trial, but
there are several good reasons for an open-label comparison of
methadone and laam: (1) experienced opioid users are able to
tell the diﬀerence between laam and methadone due to the
faster increase of serum levels after methadone intake independent of formulation [17]. this may cause a slight feeling of
euphoria or being “drugged” and is presumably less frequent
under laam maintenance. (2) both substances have similar
eﬀects on craving and withdrawal symptoms and the presumed
advantage of laam over methadone is its lower frequency of
intake. this eﬀect cannot be tested in a blinded trial, since both
groups would have to come to the clinic on a daily basis. it
remains a study design with blinded take-home doses. the
number of reliable patients receiving a permit for take-home
methadone is too small, and it is not legal to dispense a takehome dose of laam as severe intoxication may occur if it is
taken more often than every other day. the question remains
whether the non-blinded treatment may have unilaterally
improved results in the laam group. the contrary was assumed
in the publication by glanz et al. [16]. the authors speculate that
receiving laam as an experimental drug may cause suspicious
patients to drop out of a study setting and prefer methadone as
the reliable and accepted maintenance medication. another possible source of bias in our study could have been that the results
of urine drug screens were revealed to patients and treating
physicians, however, we felt that all treating physicians should
be aware of possible use of additional drugs in both groups, and
that this possible influence was equally distributed.
isolated dosage adjustments for friday doses in the laam group
were possible in our study. as a result, the friday/monday dose
relationship was higher at the end of the study as compared to
baseline when patients were switched from methadone to
laam. the reason was that many patients complained of withdrawal symptoms starting on sunday following the friday laam
intake. there was no reason to increase monday or wednesday
doses.
the percentage of participating women was higher in our study
than in many previous laam studies. the trend of favourable
results in the laam group was more pronounced in women
than in the entire study population according to a subgroup
analysis. there are few other studies specifically looking for sex
diﬀerences in response to opioid agonist treatment and the
results have been heterogeneous [26]. patients who managed to

remain opiate-free during the run-in phase clearly demonstrate
more favourable results in the laam group. one possibility is
that these patients were less severely addicted to opiates and
could profit more clearly from reduced contact to the maintenance clinics. the tennant report showed that laam may be
preferable for a subgroup of patients: the authors reported in
their investigation on 959 opioid-dependent patients treated
with laam that 39 % would completely drop out of the maintenance program if laam was not available [49].
this was the first european randomized controlled trial with
laam which was proven to be an eﬀective medication for the
maintenance treatment of opiate addiction in several north
american trials and an australian investigation. our results confirm that laam is eﬀective and clinically well tolerated. for decades cardiac ecg changes during laam treatment have been
observed. known risk factors are, e.g., previous cardiovascular
disease, excess doses of laam, medication inhibiting the p4503a4 system, and medication lowering serum potassium or magnesium [48]. taking these factors into account, stimmel [48]
suggested the following procedure: performance of a baseline
ecg in all patients prior to laam treatment with a subsequent
exclusion of patients with prolonged qtc interval, additional
ecgs two weeks after onset of laam treatment and after every
substantial change of dosage. prolongation of qtc interval is not
specific for laam, but has also been observed in methadone
treatment and with neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs [5].
this does not necessarily lead to a principal withdrawal of these
drugs from the market. instead, in order to improve the safety of
maintenance treatment, safety measures such as therapeutic
drug monitoring should be developed for maintenance drugs as
has been established for other psychiatric medication [50]. in
sum, we agree with jaﬀe [23] that it would be beneficial for opiate-addicted patients if laam were to be available as a maintenance drug.
