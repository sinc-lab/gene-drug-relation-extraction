abstract: casein kinase 2 ( xxxd1409xxx ) is a ubiquitous, essential, and highly
pleiotropic protein kinase whose abnormally high constitutive activity
is suspected to underlie its pathogenic potential in neoplasia and other
diseases. using a virtual screening approach, we have identified the
 xxxd1979xxx , a naturally occurring tannic acid derivative, as a novel
potent  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor. at present,  xxxd1979xxx  represents the most potent
known  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor (ki ) 20 nm).

casein kinase 2 ( xxxd1409xxx ) is probably the most pleiotropic protein
kinase known, with more than 300 protein substrates already
recognized, a feature which might, at least partly, account for
its lack of strict control over catalytic activity.1 its catalytic
subunits (r and/or r′) are in fact constitutively active either
with or without the regulatory beta-subunits, which appear to play
a role in targeting and substrate recruiting, rather than controlling
catalytic activity. although constitutively active  xxxd1409xxx  is ubiquitous, essential, and implicated in a wide variety of important
cell functions,2 evidence has been accumulating that its catalytic
subunits may behave as oncogenes,3-6 consistent with the
observation that they display an antiapoptotic effect in prostate
cancer cell lines.7 actually, they are invariably more abundant
in tumors as compared to normal tissues and their overexpres* to whom correspondence should be addressed. tel. +39 049 8275704.

sion is causative of neoplastic growth in animal and cellular
models presenting alterations in the expression of cellular
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.8 these data, in conjunction with the observation that many viruses exploit  xxxd1409xxx  as
phosphorylating agent of proteins essential to their life cycle,1
are raising interest in  xxxd1409xxx  as a potential target for antineoplastic
and/or antiinfectious drugs.9
in the past few years, we have performed an intensive
screening program, using both conventional and in silico
approaches, with the aim of discovering novel potent and
selective  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors.10,11 in particular, we have recently
implemented an in-house molecular database (defined as “mmsdatabase”) in which almost 2000 natural-occurring compounds
are collected for specific virtual screening applications. several
families of  xxxd1979xxx  compounds, including a large class of
flavones, flavonols, isoflavones, catechins, anthraquinones,
coumarins, and tannic acid derivatives, are represented in our
molecular database. following some recent reports of success
in the discovery of new kinase inhibitors by high-throughput
docking of large collections of compounds,12,13 we have
performed a virtual screening experiment targeting the atp
binding site of  xxxd1409xxx  by browsing the mms-database. in
principle, this strategy could represent a very useful approach
to prioritizing compounds for biological screening.14 in our
virtual screening protocol, we have decided to utilize a
combination of high-throughput docking protocols in tandem
with a consensus scoring strategy as recently presented by
miteva and collaborators.15 in particular, a combination of four
docking protocols (moe-dock,16 glide,17 fred,18 and gold19)
and five scoring functions (moe-score,16 glidescore,17 goldscore,19 chemscore,19 and xscore20) has been utilized to
appropriately dock and rank all mms-database candidates. the
flowchart of our high-throughput consensus docking is shown
in figure 1 (detailed information about the described virtual
screening strategy are described in the supporting information).
after high-throughput consensus docking, a naturally occurring
tannic acid derivative known as  xxxd1979xxx , depicted in figure
2, has been found to sit in the top 5% of the ranked database
independently from the nature of the used scoring function.
considering the unexpected and encouraging virtual screening
result, we have prioritized the acquisition and the biochemical
characterization of  xxxd1979xxx  as new potential  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor.

figure 1. flowchart of our high-throughput consensus docking.

figure 2. kinetic analysis of  xxxd1979xxx / xxxd1409xxx  complexation consistent
with a reversible and competitive mechanism of inhibition.  xxxd1409xxx  activity
was determined as described in the experimental section either in the
absence or in the presence of the indicated ea concentrations. the
data represent means of triplicate experiments with sem never
exceeding 15%.

as shown in figure 2, inhibition of  xxxd1409xxx  by  xxxd1979xxx  is
competitive with respect to the phosphodonor substrate atp,
and a 20 nm ki value has been calculated from linear regression
analysis of lineweaver-burk double reciprocal plots, which
is the lowest ki reported so far of any  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor. ellagic
acid has been previously reported to inhibit the catalytic activity
of other kinases such as pka (ic50 ) 2 µm) or pkc (ic50 )
8 µm).21 however,  xxxd1979xxx  seems to be a much more potent
and a quite specific inhibitor of  xxxd1409xxx , according to a preliminary
selectivity study (table 1). further selectivity investigations are
ongoing in our laboratories. moreover, beside  xxxd1979xxx , other
interesting  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor candidates have been selected from
our consensus “docked/scored list”, and an intensive validation
work is being carried out to determine their activities.
from a molecular point of view, similar to other  xxxd1409xxx 
inhibitors such as 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1-benzotriazole (tbb) and

to a number of condensed  xxxd1979xxx  compounds,10,11 ellagic
acid is atp-competitive and, as expected, it can occupy the
atp binding region between the n-terminal and the c-terminal
lobes of the  xxxd1409xxx  enzyme. as shown in figure 3, our molecular
docking investigations have clearly demonstrated that ellagic
acid displays a very good steric and chemical complementarity
with the atp binding cavity. interestingly, the docked conformation shown in figure 4 has been the best ranked in our highthroughput consensus docking strategy by all docking programs.
specifically,  xxxd1979xxx  lies essentially in the same plane of
all other already known polyaromatic structures but penetrates
deeper, reaching the hinge region of the enzyme.10,11 however,
the peculiarity of the  xxxd1979xxx  binding mode in comparison
to those presented by all other  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors is its ability to
simultaneously bind the hinge region and the phosphate-binding
region of the atp-binding cleft. at present, this presents a
unique binding motif among all known  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors. in fact,
in this binding configuration,  xxxd1979xxx  makes a stabilizing
interaction between the hydroxyl group at the 3-position and
the backbone carbonyls of glu114 in the hinge region (figure
3). notably, these are the same regions that interact with the
adenine moiety of atp when bound to the active site.10,11 on
the other side, both hydroxyl groups  xxxd2274xxx - and 8-positions interact
with the carboxylic group of asp175 (figure 3) through double
hydrogen-bonding interactions. in addition, several hydrophobic
interactions (val53, val66, phe113, met163, ile174) contribute
to strongly stabilize  xxxd1979xxx  in complex with  xxxd1409xxx . in
conclusion, the shape and the reduced dimension of the ck2atp binding site appear to play a key role in determining the
selectivity of  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors.10,11 the right balance of both polar
and hydrophobic interactions and the perfect shape complementarity with the atp-binding cleft are ultimately responsible
for the high potency of  xxxd1979xxx .
our findings disclose a molecular mechanism that predict,
at least in part, therapeutic potentials of  xxxd1979xxx .22 when
taken as a supplement, the  xxxd1979xxx  impacts cancer as well
as aiding in conventional radiation and chemotherapy.23,24
moreover,  xxxd1979xxx  has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor
growth induced by several chemical carcinogens in animal
models.25,26 as shown in figure 4a, in vitro growth of four
alcl cell lines, either expressing npm-alk (karpas299,
sr786 and sudhl1) or not (fe-pd), was inhibited at
micromolar concentrations in a dose-dependent manner by
treatment with  xxxd1979xxx .
cytotoxicity profile measured after 48-h exposure demonstrated that  xxxd1979xxx  almost completely inhibited the growth
of sudhl1 and fepd cells at the highest concentrations (85
and 70%, respectively), whereas about 60 and 40% growth
inhibition was observed in karpas299 and sr786 cells,
respectively, under the same experimental conditions. the
findings that  xxxd1979xxx  strongly reduces viability also of fepd cells that are npm-alk negative together with the absence
of a direct inhibition of npm-alk observed in vitro on the
recombinant enzyme (table 1) support the view that the
cytotoxic effect of  xxxd1979xxx  in all alcl cell lines is mediated
by  xxxd1409xxx . in line with previous reports, we observed that higher
concentrations than those used in vitro were required to assess
the antiproliferative activity of  xxxd1979xxx  in living cells. this

dose- and time-dependent manner, as previously shown.28 to
better elucidate the possible mechanism of action of  xxxd1979xxx 
in alcl cell lines, exponentially growing cells were cultured
in the presence of the drug for 48 h, and induction of
programmed cell death was investigated by assessing molecular
events occurring downstream activation of caspase cysteine
proteases, which are known to be responsible for execution of
apoptosis. to this end, the activity of effector caspases in cells
undergoing apoptosis has been shown to promote the activation
of enzymes responsible for chromatin condensation and fragmentation, as well as to result in proteolytical inhibition of
selected target proteins, such as the dna-damage repairing
enzyme parp (poly(adp-ribose)polymerase). collapse of
nuclear integrity and the appearance of apoptotic bodies was
observed in all four alcl cell lines at 48 h posttreatment
(figure 4b, arrowheads), and this was accompanied by increased
cleavage of the 116 kda apoptotic marker protein parp into
its 89 kda polypeptide (figure 4c, cleaved parp). hence,
although we cannot exclude the involvement of caspaseindependent effectors, these data indicate that induction of
programmed cell death, through activation of pro-apoptotic
caspases, takes place in alcl treated cells and perhaps
represents a leading mechanism for the cytotoxicity of ellagic
acid in vivo. we are presently synthesizing different focused
libraries of  xxxd1979xxx  analogues with the aim of increasing
the potency and selectivity against  xxxd1409xxx .
figure 4. (a) effect of  xxxd1979xxx  on cell viability. karpas299,
sudhl1, sr786, and fe-pd cell lines were cultured in the presence
or absence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd1979xxx  (5-100 × 10-6
m) for 48 h. cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. values represent the
mean of triplicate cultures. control cells (dmso) were assigned
viability ) 1.0. (b) log-phase growing alcl cells (0.5 × 106/ml)
were treated for 48 h with  xxxd1979xxx  (100 × 10-6 m) or left untreated
(dmso) and then processed for immunofluorescence analysis as
described in material and methods. the cells were stained with 4′-6diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi), and nuclei were observed using a
fluorescence microscope. (c). to assay cleavage of the apoptotic
hallmark parp protein, exponentially growing alcl cells were treated
with  xxxd1979xxx  (+) or left untreated (-) as described above, and then
lysed in 0.1% sds ripa buffer. parp protein steady-state was
analyzed by western blotting, using a specific antibody recognizing
the 89 kda-cleaved fragment.

may be due to a number of factors, notably slow permeability,
instability, and/or competitive mechanisms inside the cells, such
as the high concentration of endogenous atp.28 however, we
cannot exclude that even in the absence of appreciable cytotoxicity the drug is effective in inducing cell cycle arrest in a
