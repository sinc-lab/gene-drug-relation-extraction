characterization of the renal tubular transport of zonampanel, a novel alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4- xxxd3029xxx  receptor antagonist...  zonampanel monohydrate (ym872; [2,3-dioxo-7-(1h-imidazol-1-yl)-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-quinoxalinyl]acetic acid monohydrate) is a novel alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4- xxxd3029xxx  (ampa) receptor antagonist. the major elimination route for zonampanel has been reported to be by urine via the kidneys. the purpose of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the renal excretion of zonampanel using cells stably expressing human organic anion transporters (hoat) 1,  xxxg2114xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx , as well as human organic cation transporters (hoct) 1 and hoct2. another  xxxg981xxx  antagonist, ym90k [6-(1h-imidazol-1-yl)-7-nitro-2,3(1h,4h)-quinoxalinedione monohydrochloride], a decarboxymethylated form of zonampanel, was also used for comparing the substrate specificity. zonampanel inhibited the uptake of prototypical organic anion substrates, [14c]para-aminohippurate in  xxxg2113xxx  and [3h] xxxd2046xxx  in  xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx , in a competitive manner. a time- and concentration-dependent increase in [14c]zonampanel uptake was observed in cells expressing  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx . the km values of zonampanel uptake by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  were 1.4, 7.7, and 215 microm, respectively. considering the localization of each transporter, results suggest that zonampanel is taken up via  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  from the blood into proximal tubular cells and then effluxed into the lumen via  xxxg2109xxx . probenecid and cimetidine competitively inhibited [14c]zonampanel uptake by the hoats ( xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  for probenecid;  xxxg2115xxx  for cimetidine). ym90k inhibited the uptake of the prototypical substrate via  xxxg2115xxx  competitively, but the uptake via  xxxg2113xxx  noncompetitively. these findings suggest that the prototypical organic anion substrates (para-aminohippurate and  xxxd2046xxx ), cimetidine, probenecid, and zonampanel share binding specificity in each hoat, whereas ym90k does not in  xxxg2113xxx , possibly due to it being the decarboxymethylated form.
