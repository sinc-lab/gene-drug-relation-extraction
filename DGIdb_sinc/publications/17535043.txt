abstract

psychoses are major mental disorders marked by derangement of personality
and loss of contact with reality, and are common in the elderly. various hypotheses suggest the pivotal role of abnormal neurotransmitter and neuropeptide
systems in psychotic patients, the most studied of which are the dopaminergic,
serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. in particular, long-term treatment with
antagonists at dopamine (d) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) receptors and agonists at glutamate receptors may improve symptoms. treatment with
antipsychotics is very common in the elderly and often indispensable. however,
for successful treatment it is essential to have an adequate multidimensional
assessment of the geriatric patient and of his or her polypathology and
polypharmacy, together with knowledge of age-dependent pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamic changes and drug-drug interactions.
conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine,  xxxd3024xxx ,
tiapride and  xxxd3568xxx  are d2-receptor antagonists and inhibit dopaminergic
neurotransmission in a dose-related manner. they decrease the intensity of all
psychotic symptoms, although not necessarily to the same extent and with the
same time course. negative symptoms may persist to a much more striking extent
than delusions, hallucinations and thought disorders, and there is a dose-related
incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (eps). newer antipsychotics, such as
clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and ziprasidone, have a different
receptor-binding profile, interacting with both d and 5-ht receptors; they less
frequently cause eps and are better tolerated in the elderly. their use is advantageous because they are effective both on positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia and may also be used in the treatment of behavioural disturbances
in elderly and/or demented individuals. the use of clozapine is limited by the
onset of agranulocytosis, whereas olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and, more
recently, ziprasidone are widely used, with good results in the above-mentioned
diseases.

psychoses are common in the elderly, because
they can be either the expression of a disease that
had its onset at a young age or the complications of
some organic diseases beginning in later life (e.g.
dementia).
psychoses are major mental disorders of organic
or emotional origin marked by derangement of personality and loss of contact with reality. they are

events and interior experiences, with delusions or
prominent hallucinations occurring in the absence of
insight;[1] their prevalence varies from 6% to 10% in
the elderly population.[2,3] various hypotheses suggest the pivotal role of abnormal neurotransmitter
and neuropeptide systems in psychotic patients. the

nin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) receptors and agonists at glutamate receptors may improve symptoms.
therefore,
pathophysiological
studies
on
dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic
neurotransmission have been the basis of modern
pharmacology for psychotic disorders. in particular,
we have focused on neurobiological studies that
have led to the development of modern antipsychotic drugs.
1. neurotransmitter systems
and psychoses
1.1 the dopamine hypothesis

the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia and
psychoses was formulated in the 1950s, when delay
et al.[5] discovered the potential therapeutic effects
of chlorpromazine, which has since that time been
known as an antihistaminic drug that suppresses
hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenic patients. this pharmacological activity was described
as ‘neuroleptic’ action. later, neurochemical experiments in animal brain and animal behavioural studies led to the recognition of the dopamine antagonist
properties of the antipsychotic agents.[6-8] on the
other hand, amphetamine, by releasing dopamine
from central nerve terminals, could exacerbate
psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.[9,10]
recently, most attention has been focused on
possible mutations or deficits in dopamine receptors. at present, five subtypes of dopamine receptors
have been distinguished by gene cloning;[11,12] they
are g-protein-coupled receptors, monomers with
seven transmembrane domains. agonist binding
evokes the activation of a g-protein that hydrolyses
 xxxd2247xxx . the g-protein dissociates
and activates an effector protein, which is an enzyme or an ion channel that either produces an
intracellular second messenger (e.g.  xxxd1773xxx  [camp], inositol triphosphate
or  xxxd208xxx ) or causes ion fluxes.[13,14] dopamine receptors have been grouped into two main
classes: d1-like (d1 and d5) and d2-like (d2, d3
and d4).[15] activation of the former causes an in© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

crease in camp, whereas activation of the latter
causes a decrease in camp. d1 receptors are more
abundant in the brain and seem to have a role in
actions of dopamine in the control of motor, cognitive and cardiovascular functions.[16,17] however,
d1-receptor antagonists do not show any antipsychotic activity. on the contrary, d2-receptor antagonists play a key role in the treatment of positive
symptoms of psychoses. excessive blockade of
these receptors may cause extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) and may be involved in the development
of tardive dyskinesia.
all the currently known antipsychotics, except
the obsolete monoamine depletor reserpine, are d2
antagonists. studies on receptor occupancy by positron emission tomography have clearly demonstrated that moderate blockade of central d2 receptors is
adequate for treatment of positive symptoms of
psychoses, whereas a high degree of d2-receptor
occupancy gives rise to eps. in particular, it has
been widely shown that striatal d2-receptor occupancy as measured with [123i]odobenzamide and
single photon emission tomography is able to predict the occurrence of eps in patients treated with
antipsychotics.[18] moreover, it is widely known that
the blockade of d2 receptors in the anterior pituitary
gland causes elevation of blood prolactin levels.[19,20] post-mortem studies on brains of patients
affected with schizophrenia have shown elevated
levels of striatal d2 receptors, although it is not
entirely clear whether this increase in d2 receptors is
a result of treatment with antipsychotic drugs or is
related to the disease process.[21]
d3 antagonists showed no antipsychotic activity
in patients with schizophrenia, nor was any linkage
shown between the d2 and  xxxg657xxx  genes and
the onset of schizophrenia.[22] clozapine, a prototype of the atypical antipsychotics, has a higher
affinity for d4 than for d2 receptors. in addition,
pipamperone, which shows antipsychotic activity,
has a 15-fold higher affinity for d4 than d2 receptors.[4] moreover, it has been suggested that d4
receptors may play a role in the modulation of
gabaergic neuronal activity by dopamine.[23]
however, a potent and selective d4 antagonist,

gareri et al.

l-745870, failed to reveal antipsychotic activity.[23]
table i presents the dopamine receptor subtypes and
their main individual features.
1.2 the serotonin hypothesis

the possible involvement of serotonergic neurotransmission in the onset of psychoses was suggested by the ability of some chlorpromazine-like antipsychotics to antagonise the behavioural effects of
the 5-ht-receptor agonist tryptamine in rats, and by
the hallucinogenic action of  xxxd2527xxx  (lysergic acid
diethylamide, lsd), a 5-ht agonist. later on, some
receptor-binding sites for certain antipsychotics
were shown to be 5-ht receptors, particularly subtype 5-ht2a. pipamperone, a butyrophenone showing predominant 5-ht2a antagonist properties, was
noted for its anti-agitation and resocialising effects
and for its ability to normalise sleep rhythms in
psychiatric patients.[24,25] several years ago, ritanserin, a long-acting 5-ht2a antagonist, was found to
attenuate haloperidol-induced eps, and was shown
to be very effective against the negative symptoms
of both schizophrenia and dysthymia.[26,27] later,
risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic showing very
potent 5-ht2a antagonism with a weaker d2 antagonism, was developed.[28-30] it is successfully used in
treating the positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia, in both the young and the elderly.
moreover, it enhances cognition and has fewer adverse effects than the conventional antipsychotics;[31-33] its action suggests that negative symptoms
may derive from the overactivation of excitatory
5-ht2a receptors. this receptor subtype seems to be
the most important serotonin receptor, since all the
newer antipsychotics are relatively potent 5-ht2a
antagonists and are more potent antagonists at
5-ht2a than at d2 receptors.[34-37]
the localisation of 5-ht2a receptors in mammalian brain has been extensively studied by means of
radioligand autoradiography, in situ hybridisation of
mrna and immunocytochemistry. these receptors
occur mainly in the telencephalon and much less in
the midbrain and hindbrain.[4] some antipsychotics
also show relatively high binding affinity for
5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors. twelve mam© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

malian 5-ht receptors are known; they belong to
the superfamily of g-protein-coupled receptors, except the  xxxg1116xxx , which is a ligand-gated
cation channel. recently, other subtypes have been
found, although they are not yet well characterised.
table ii summarises the 5-ht receptor subtypes
and their main individual features, as previously
reported.[38-40]
1.3 the glutamate hypothesis

dysfunction of corticolimbic glutamatergic
neurotransmission may contribute to or account for
the manifestations of psychoses.[41,42] in fact, glutamatergic neurons represent the primary excitatory
afferent and efferent systems innervating the cortex,
limbic regions and striatum. a dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission may be relevant in
forms of psychosis characterised by negative symptoms and cognitive deficits and deterioration. the
postsynaptic actions of glutamate are mediated by a
family of glutamate-gated ion channels that permit
the influx of sodium and calcium, so depolarising
exciting neurons. one of these receptors, the nmethyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor, is the site of
action of psychotomimetics such as phencyclidine,
ketamine and related anaesthetics, which in healthy
individuals can reproduce most of the symptomatic
features of schizophrenia.
there have been at least three lines of evidence in
the development of the hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia and psychoses.
in 1980, kim et al.[43] proposed the glutamate
hypothesis based on their finding that the glutamate
levels in cerebrospinal fluid of 20 schizophrenic
patients (16 with chronic disease) were about onehalf the normal value.[44] they hypothesised primarily impaired function of the glutamatergic neurons
in schizophrenia. in addition, sherman and coworkers[45,46] demonstrated that the release of glutamate was reduced by high k+ in the synaptosomes
of schizophrenic patients and this may support the
hypoglutamatergic hypothesis.
phencyclidine, which has been known as a
psychotomimetic street drug since the early
1960s,[47] is reported to block the nmda ion chanclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

nel.[48] unlike amphetamines, phencyclidine exacerbates psychotic symptoms in chronic schizophrenia.[49] in addition, phencyclidine-induced psychosis
is regarded as a better pharmacological model of
schizophrenia[50-52] than amphetamine-induced psychosis, because this model can mimic not only positive symptoms but also negative ones.[53,54]
among glutamate receptors, the kainate (ka)
receptor was first measured in the post-mortem
brains of schizophrenic patients by nishikawa et
al.,[55] who, in 1983, reported increased 3h-ka
binding to the putamen and prefrontal cortex areas.
a significant increase was found in off-drug
psychotic patients compared with healthy controls
in these two areas. this biochemical alteration may
be related to the impairment of prefrontal cortical
function such as certain cognitive functions, alterations in affective and social behaviour, and abnormal eye movements, which are often observed in
psychotic patients. the increased ka receptor binding may reflect reduced activity at certain glutamatergic synapses in the cns.
the 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole4)- xxxd3029xxx  (ampa) receptor was found to be
unchanged in some brain areas in patients with
schizophrenia and in controls.[56] although the brain
areas analysed were restricted and further studies are
required, abnormalities of ampa receptors in the
brain were thought to be minimally involved in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. some years ago,
ampakines, a family of substances that freely cross
the blood-brain barrier and positively modulate
ampa receptors, were developed.[57] they enhance
glutamatergic transmission,[58] facilitate long-term
potentiation[59] and enhance learning and memory in
rodents[60] and humans,[61] suggesting the drugs may
improve cognitive dysfunction in patients. consonant with the general idea of competitive glutamatergic/dopaminergic systems, an ampakine has
been shown to reduce the aberrant behaviours induced in rats by methamphetamine,[62] a common
and predictive test of antipsychotic drug activity.
some ampakines, such as cx516 and others, hold
promise for the treatment of psychoses and seem to
improve attention and memory.[63]

gareri et al.

moreover, there are three studies in which the ion
channel of the nmda receptor was assayed.
kornhuber et al.[64] measured nmda receptors by
using 3h-mk-801, an nmda-receptor antagonist,
and found a binding increase in the putamen of the
schizophrenic brain. another study showed an increase in nmda receptors in three brain areas, the
superior temporal cortex, superior parietal cortex
and supramarginal cortex, among 13 areas measured.[65] simpson et al.[51] reported that 3htrichloropropane binding was bilaterally increased
in the orbital frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients. the three studies therefore indicated an increase in nmda receptors labelled by 3h-ion channel blockers in several areas of schizophrenic brains,
the areas differing among the studies.
in one of the studies on the nmda receptor,
ishimaru et al.[66] found that strychnine-sensitive
glycine-binding sites were significantly increased in
six of the 16 areas of the schizophrenic cerebral
cortex. the authors excluded the effects of longterm treatment with antipsychotic drugs on the binding data from animal experiments. the extent of the
increase in 3h-glycine binding is more pronounced
and anatomically more widespread than that in 3hmk-801 binding, investigated in the same brain
series.
the significance of the increased ionotropic
glutamate, nmda receptor or glycine-binding sites
has not yet been elaborated, but a possible explanation is a postsynaptic compensation for impaired
glutamatergic neurotransmission. similar mechanisms may occur in the brain of psychotic patients
during the chronic stage of schizophrenia.
dopaminergic hyperactivity is believed to be a
prominent cause of schizophrenia. the release of
glutamate may be inhibited by dopamine receptors
located on corticostriatal terminals,[67-69] probably
acting presynaptically.[70]
interactions between glutamate and dopamine in
the striatum are, however, reciprocal.[70] it has also
been shown that glutamate presynaptically stimulates the release of dopamine from the striatum.[71-73]
conversely, the nmda receptor located on
dopaminergic terminals in the cingulate cortex meclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

diates presynaptic inhibition of dopaminergic terminals in the cingulate cortex and along the mesocortical pathway.[74] deutsch et al.[75] first demonstrated
that phencyclidine increased dopamine metabolism
in the mesolimbic and mesocortical areas, but did
not influence dopamine neurons in the striatum.
as for the subclassification of psychotic disorders, there has been agreement that patients with
positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, are more likely to respond to antipsychotic
drugs.[76] it is possible to assume that primarily
dopaminergic hyperactivity exists in the brain of
such individuals. in patients with antipsychotic
drug-refractory negative symptoms, such as flattened affect and social withdrawal, abnormal neurotransmitter substances other than dopamine may be
involved, in addition to brain atrophy.[77] one such
candidate transmitter is glutamate, and its hypofunction can be hypothesised. patients with negative
symptoms may be subclassified into two groups.
one group is core schizophrenic patients, who develop negative symptoms from the beginning of the
illness with intellectual and personality deterioration; glutamatergic hypofunction may primarily exist in the brain of such patients. another group is
characterised by shifting from positive to negative
symptoms during the course of the beginning of the
illness. in other words, patients show positive symptoms and respond well to antipsychotic drugs at the
beginning. during the clinical course with periodic
or repetitive relapses, they gradually shift to an
antipsychotic drug-refractory, deteriorated state. in
the latter subtype, dopaminergic hyperactivity mainly exists in the early stage but a long-term
hyperdopaminergic state may induce glutamatergic
hypofunction in the brain, resulting in the patients
entering a chronic and deteriorated state.
the following points may therefore support the
above inference. firstly, psychoses induced by
phencyclidine, an ion channel blocker of the nmda
receptor, are sometimes refractory to antipsychotic
drugs[47,53] and cause schizophrenia-like symptoms,
including negative ones. secondly, glutamatergic
ionotropic receptors such as ka, nmda and
strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding sites in© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

creased in our brain series obtained from patients
with chronic schizophrenia and they showed significant negative correlations with glutamate concentrations.[44] finally, the above-mentioned interactions
between dopamine and glutamate in the brain will
furnish valuable evidence.
because biochemical post-mortem studies on
brains of schizophrenic patients revealed abnormalities of several transmitter substances, for example
 xxxg2240xxx  and benzodiazepine receptors,[44] further intensive studies should lead to a better understanding of psychoses.
an endogenous antagonist at the nmda receptor, n-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, appears to have enhanced activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampal formation in persons with these disorders. this
means that drugs enhancing nmda-receptor function reduce negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in persons with chronic psychosis who are receiving antipsychotics.[78] table iii summarises the
types and properties of excitatory amino acid receptors.
2. use of antipsychotics in psychiatry
antipsychotics are among the most effective
drugs used in psychiatry and reach the level of
efficacy common for accepted medications in other
fields of medicine. as shown by a number of double-blind studies lasting 4–8 weeks, antipsychotics
are effective drugs in 50–80% of treated patients; in
the maintenance therapy of schizophrenia, the relapse rate of patients treated with antipsychotics is
several times lower than that of placebo-treated patients.[79] efficacy in mania or in acute psychotic
reactions is at least as great as in schizophrenia. in
several other indications (e.g. delusional disorders,
borderline psychoses, neurological conditions, behavioural disturbances), clinical study has been less
comprehensive, often limited to particular antipsychotics or cases, but is also positive in terms of the
remarkable improvement of patients. in psychotic
exacerbations, in mania and acute schizophrenia,
relatively high dosages of antipsychotics are indicated (e.g. in the elderly, haloperidol 10–20mg or
chlorpromazine 25mg every 8 hours).[80] in disorclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

ders with minimal involvement of psychosis, treatment is started with a low dose that may be increased slowly according to therapeutic response.
this is a rule, especially in the elderly. abrupt
discontinuation of antipsychotics may lead to withdrawal symptoms and should therefore be avoided.
conventional
antipsychotic
drugs
are
d2-receptor antagonists and inhibit dopaminergic
neurotransmission in a dose-related manner. there
is good agreement between the concept of
dopaminergic equilibrium and therapeutic effectiveness.[81] unlike purely sedating drugs, all of which
may reduce psychomotor agitation, they decrease
the intensity of all psychotic symptoms, although
not necessarily to the same extent and with the same
time course. negative symptoms, related to withdrawal and flat affect, may persist to a much more
striking degree than delusions, hallucinations and
thought disorders. there is a dose-related incidence
of eps. at fixed, high doses of potent antipsychotics, the incidence and intensity of eps are frequently
judged to be excessively high.[81] in other studies,
however, the same drugs are used at individually
adapted doses below the antipsychotic threshold and
yet produce the desired antipsychotic effect.[79,80]
for most patients, adequate clinical improvement
does not appear to depend on doses that result in
disturbing adverse effects. some of the more potent
antipsychotics can be used intramuscularly for rapid
neuroleptisation. the advantages of rapid control of
psychosis must be weighed against the fact that in
many patients thought disorders and other symptoms may require weeks of treatment to be resolved.
in daily practice, an antipsychotic is rarely selected at random, because the known differences in
pharmacological spectrum and pharmacokinetics
lead to differential prescription according to the
severity of the condition and the characteristics of
the patient (e.g. age). in fact, aging leads to remarkable changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, sensitivity to various potential adverse effects, and the requirements of rapid and complete
recovery with the lowest possible dose. as regards
the dosage, the choice is based on previous history,
physical condition, age and clinical evolution. addi© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

tional measures, including psychotherapy, family
education, social rehabilitation and social steps, may
consolidate the results of pharmacotherapy. the
most disturbing adverse effects can be avoided by
using the most appropriate drugs and dosages.
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations favour the specific, potent antipsychotics
with good oral bioavailability. clinically, the spectrum and intensity of symptoms, desirability of initial sedation, differences in potential adverse effects
or in outpatient conditions, and other factors may
vary sufficiently to consider several options from
haloperidol-like to thioridazine-like antipsychotics
and also new antipsychotics.[82] in fact, modern antipsychotics can be successfully used as first-line
therapy, in both the young and the elderly.[82] in
several clinical indications, the selection of particular drugs is imperative. for intense acute psychotic
reactions, injectable preparations of potent antipsychotics with minimal cardiovascular or other autonomic effects are available, e.g. tiapride, olanzepine.
the same compounds are preferable for other shortterm or high-dose applications. if high-dose treatment of schizophrenia during the first 4–6 days is
therapeutically ineffective or not tolerated, switching to a different antipsychotic for a second or third
treatment period may lead to improvement.[83]
for psychosis in elderly patients and general
medical indications, e.g. dementia, low doses of
potent antipsychotics are considered the most appropriate and well tolerated. in monodelusional disorders and in predominantly negative schizophrenic
syndromes, atypical antipsychotics are much more
effective and well tolerated in the elderly. the injectable diphenylbutylpiperidine  xxxd2142xxx , in
low-dose therapy, has marked activity in minor tranquilliser indications even if in such cases benzodiazepines appear to be more appropriate and safer.
apparent effectiveness (greater calmness, less aggressiveness) is the first sign of a reduction in psychomotor agitation, which is a preliminary step to a
change in other ‘core’ symptoms.[84]
true antipsychotic effects are obtained in the
course of weeks of treatment, in which signs of
hallucinations, delusions and thought disorders may

regress. frequently, the effect of appropriate doses
of antipsychotics on negative and positive symptoms is sufficiently large to avoid long-term hospitalisation. if the expected remission does not start
within 6 weeks and there are no disturbing adverse
effects, higher doses can be used for a limited time,
even though the proportion of responders decreases
with increasing doses. maintenance treatment at a
dose lower than the acutely effective dose markedly
reduces relapse rate. every relapse further complicates the outcome for the patient.[84]
moderate, individually adapted doses limit the
incidence of disturbing eps. early recognition of
treatment failures and avoidance of coadministration of anticholinergics with antipsychotics largely
eliminate many other difficulties associated with
antipsychotic treatment. tolerance develops to the
antipsychotic-induced sedative effects. tolerance
and cross-tolerance are also observed in behavioural
and biochemical effects, particularly related to
blockade of dopaminergic receptors in the basal
ganglia.[35,81] these drugs are not addictive; however, a mild degree of physical dependence is manifested by muscular discomfort, and difficulty in
sleeping may occur several days after abrupt discontinuation.[81] adverse effects include, firstly, eps,
which are typical for antipsychotics. the second
group of adverse effects involves non-eps dosedependent effects related to common activity components of the known antipsychotics. the symptoms
associated with eps are dose dependent and are
observed with all antipsychotics at usual clinical
doses, but with variable incidence and severity. the
lowest incidence, about 4%, is observed with clozapine, and the incidence increases several-fold with
more specific, potent antipsychotics.[84] two known
factors have a major effect on the incidence of eps.
one is related to the pharmacological profile, since
antimuscarinic and antiserotonin activity decrease
the relative risk of eps. the other factor is related to
practical use. when using the less specific and
weaker antipsychotics in the elderly, dosage increments are usually slower, and the upper limit is
lower than in the young, leading to more gradual and

gareri et al.

less extreme d2-receptor occupation. more conservative use of potent antipsychotics in sensitive
individuals can prevent some of the eps observed in
clinical studies using fixed doses.[84]
most patients with schizophrenia obtain a good
clinical response with doses of antipsychotics not
inducing distinct eps. the antipsychotic threshold
for eps can be artificially raised by concomitant
treatment with an anticholinergic. however, this
second therapeutic agent has its own adverse effect
profile and in fact conceals the effects of antipsychotic overdose. the dose of antipsychotic causing symptoms of overdose in the elderly varies
depending on individual factors and drug-drug interactions, and of course it depends on the changes in
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics usually
present during ageing. therefore, a normal dosage
in the young may be toxic in the elderly, leading, for
example, to adverse effects, such as tardive dyskinesia, especially when combined with a drug that
masks the neurological signs of the antipsychotics.
as can be expected from the chemical heterogeneity of antipsychotics, the metabolic and
pharmacokinetic behaviour of these compounds is
not uniform. some antipsychotics appear to be better candidates for therapeutic monitoring than
others. the ability to monitor pharmacokinetic parameters of a given antipsychotic has, in part, a
technical basis. high pressure liquid chromatography generally provides the best separation of parent
drug, isomer and metabolites; however, this approach may not always provide needed sensitivity.
radioimmunoassays are usually very sensitive, but
specificity of the assay depends on the antiserum
batch. the gas chromatographic/mass spectrometer
approach is specific and sensitive, but the costs are
high for such an instrument, and specially trained
professionals are required for the assays and for
maintaining the equipment. for practical drug monitoring, the radioreceptor assay may have advantages, because it measures, in the plasma sample, the
total binding activity of the drug and active metabolite to d2 receptors.[4]

3. in vitro receptor binding profile
of antipsychotics
the receptor binding affinity of the compounds
for neurotransmitter receptor subtypes has been assessed by radioligands. receptor subtypes are
grouped according to neurotransmitter: dopamine
(five subtypes), 5-ht (12 subtypes), adrenoceptors
(four subtypes, none of the compounds binds to beta1or beta2-adrenoceptors), histamine (one subtype), and
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (no subtype differentiation). some compounds show high
d2-receptor affinity (i.e. haloperidol,  xxxd3024xxx  and
clotiapine [figure 1]); others show intermediate d2
affinity (i.e. risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone,  xxxd3195xxx , ziprasidone and zotepine [figure 2 and figure 3]). others have low to moderate affinity[4] (i.e.
olanzapine, clozapine, pipamperone and quetiapine
[figure 2 and figure 3]). olanzapine and clozapine
show a similar binding affinity for d1 and d2 receptors (figure 2), and ziprasidone has a 15-fold higher
affinity for d2 than for d4 receptors. the contribution of  xxxg658xxx  blockade to the therapeutic action of the compounds remains to be elucidated. the
two butyrophenones, haloperidol and pipamperone,
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

have quite different receptor-binding profiles. haloperidol is the prototype of conventional antipsychotics, and shows high d2-receptor binding affinity and
has a moderate affinity for alpha1-adrenoceptors, and
shows no or few interactions with other neurotransmitter receptors. on the contrary, pipamperone
binds primarily to 5-ht2a receptors, with a nearly
equal affinity to d4 receptors and a moderate affinity for 5-ht2c, d2, d3, alpha1- and alpha2b-adrenoceptors.
however, the compounds showing primary 5-ht2areceptor affinity include risperidone (figure 2),
pipamperone and  xxxd3195xxx  (figure 3).[4]
the tricyclic agents (clozapine, olanzapine,
zotepine and quetiapine) have their highest affinity
for h1 receptors (figure 2 and figure 3);[4] this probably explains the highly sedative effects of these
drugs and, in some cases, may contribute to weight
increase.
moreover,
quetiapine,
clozapine,
pipamperone,  xxxd3195xxx  and zotepine show a very
high potency at alpha1-adrenoceptors compared with d2
receptors, whereas risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, ziprasidone and olanzapine have approximately equal affinity for d2 and alpha1-adrenoceptors
(figure 2 and figure 3). haloperidol is more potent at
d2 than at alpha1-adrenoceptors. central alpha1-adreclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

inhibits adrenergic transmission and may contribute
to enhanced cognition and antidepressant effects,
while peripheral blockade can increase cardiac output.
relatively potent muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding is found for clozapine, olanzapine
and quetiapine; anticholinergic activity accounts for
various adverse effects such as delirium, confusion,
cognitive deficits, blurred vision, dry mouth, urinary
retention and constipation. it may reduce eps, but
may promote the development of tardive dyskinesia.[4]
4. antipsychotics in the elderly
antipsychotic treatment is common in the elderly
and often indispensable. results of an adequate multidimensional evaluation of a geriatric patient, including polypathology and polypharmacy on the
one hand and comprehensive knowledge of drugdrug interactions and age-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes on the other,
are essential for successful treatment.[85]
4.1 age-related changes in
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics may cause an increase in adverse drug reactions in elderly persons.
4.1.1 pharmacokinetics

ageing causes a number of changes in drug absorption, distribution, biotransformation and elimination.[86,87] drug pharmacokinetics may change
with age as a consequence of living habits in elderly
individuals, such as diet, alcohol consumption,
smoking, concomitant use of other drugs and genetic polymorphism of hepatic enzymes, diseases,
etc.[88] (figure 4).
the most important factors influencing drug absorption in the aged are:
• the increase in gastric ph, resulting from the
reduction in acid output from the gastric parietal
cells.[89] the increase in gastric ph increases the
absorption of basic drugs and reduces the absorption of acid drugs;

•

the reduction in gastrointestinal motility, with
consequent delayed gastric emptying;[86]
• the reduction in splanchnic blood[90]flow resulting
from diminished cardiac output;
• the decrease in absorption surface in the gastrointestinal tract.
the distribution of a drug is influenced by tissue
blood flow, plasma protein binding and the physicochemical properties of the drug itself.[86] moreover,
it is influenced by lean and non-lean body mass,
total body water and extracellular volume. since
adipose mass increases with aging, whereas total
body water is reduced, the volume of distribution is
less for water-soluble drugs and greater for lipidsoluble ones, such as diazepam, nitrazepam, amitriptyline, lidocaine ( xxxd2482xxx ), haloperidol, chlorpromazine and 3h-spiperone.[91] therefore, these
lipid-soluble drugs tend to accumulate in adipose
tissue, resulting in increases in their plasma halflives and their duration of action, thus increasing the
risk of iatrogenic effects in elderly persons.[81,89,92-94]
plasma-binding proteins are albumin, alpha1-acid
glycoprotein and lipoproteins. aging causes reduced synthesis of these proteins; in persons older
than 80 years, albumin synthesis is 20% less than in
a young adult, while it is even less in elderly patients
affected by liver and/or renal failure (table iv).
these pathological conditions may alter plasma protein levels and cause accumulation of some substances competing with drugs in protein binding.[94]
albumin mainly binds to acid drugs, such as warfarin,  xxxd3159xxx , phenytoin, haloperidol and risperclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

of chlorpromazine, propranolol and pethidine is virtually unaffected by age or may be slightly increased
for chlorpromazine.[97]
another crucial point in drug kinetics is metabolism. liver clearance of a drug depends mainly on
liver blood flow, which decreases with aging, and on
liver enzyme activity. the latter depends on phase 1
and phase 2 reactions. in phase 1 reactions the
involved enzymes are called mixed-function oxidases, composed of a number of haemoproteins,
such as cytochrome p450 (cyp), cytochrome b5
and a flavoprotein,  xxxd3210xxx  (nadph)-cytochrome-c-reductase.
phase 2 reactions involve acetylation and conjugation reactions with glycuronic acid. phase 2 reactions are not influenced by age, whereas phase 1
reactions are strongly influenced by aging, sex and
genetic factors. in fact, the existence of a genetic
polymorphism in the oxidative metabolism of some
drugs, such as antidepressants and beta-blockers, has
been shown.[86,98-100] therefore, genetic mutations
inherited as recessive autosomal characters might
cause reduced synthesis of various cyp isoenzymes
(now named cyp2d6, cyp1a2, cyp2c9,
cyp2c19 and cyp3a4) [table v]. this means that
for a given substance, i.e. the prototype  xxxd1818xxx , an experimental antihypertensive drug, there
are fast metabolisers (90% of individuals) and slow
metabolisers (10%; that is, those with genetic mutations).[101] several years ago, alexanderson et al.[98]

administered the same dose of nortriptyline to
monozygotic and dizygotic twins. the results were
remarkable, as they showed that plasma nortriptyline concentrations were equal in monozygotic
twins, but different in dizygotic twins. furthermore,
even in the monozygotic twins, the concentrations
could be different if one was at the same time treated
with other drugs. in fact, liver metabolism may also
be influenced by smoking, liver disease, alcohol,
nutritional status and, especially in the elderly, concomitant administration of various drugs. the last
factor is important because drugs may increase or
reduce microsomal enzymes that metabolise drugs.
the former are called inducers, the latter inhibitors.
liver metabolism of a drug can also be reduced by
another drug via competition for the same enzyme
system.
4.1.2 genetic polymorphism of hepatic enzymes

cyp isoenzymes have a particular role in drug
metabolism, both in adults and in the elderly. in
humans, more than 30 cyp isoenzymes have been
identified; cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6
and cyp3a4 are important in the metabolism of a
number of antipsychotics (table v). a genetic polymorphism has been described for two of them
(cyp2d6 and cyp2c19), and two phenotypes have
been identified – poor metabolisers and extensive
metabolisers.[102-104] therefore, all patients presenting a genetic deficiency of these enzymes may have
a higher risk of adverse effects when they are treated
with a drug that is a substrate of these
isoforms.[105,106] on the other hand, the discovery of
a gene amplification for cyp2d6 may explain the
existence of ultrarapid metabolisers.[101] isoenzymes
of cyp1a2 and cyp3a4 have shown a high interindividual variability in their activity, which may be
induced by some exogenous factors, such as smoking and drugs (i.e. barbiturates, carbamazepine,
phenytoin) [table v]. moreover, cyp2d6 is the
cytochrome whose polymorphism has been better
studied. the activity of this isoenzyme is deficient
or absent in 5%–8% of white people and 2%–5% of
black and oriental people. this cytochrome is involved in the metabolism of some antipsychotics,
i.e. thioridazine, perphenazine, fluphenazine,

antidepressants (tcas) – such as amitriptyline,
imipramine and clomipramine, and some antipsychotics – such as clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol. it is inhibited by fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin (table v). cyp2c19 is responsible for
demethylation of diazepam and tertiary amines of
the tcas. cyp3a4 is important for the metabolism
of short half-life benzodiazepines, such as triazolam, some dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, immunosuppressants (cyclosporin), erythromycin and
other macrolides, some tcas, sertraline and citalopram, and it represents a secondary metabolism
pathway for venlafaxine.[108,109] other substrates are
antiepileptics such as carbamazepine,  xxxd2090xxx  and
tiagabine and some antipsychotics such as haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone
and  xxxd3195xxx  (table v).
4.1.3 drug excretion

ageing also causes reduced renal drug excretion.
this occurs even in the absence of overt renal failure, because glomerular filtration in elderly persons
is 30%–35% less than in young adults and tubular
function and renal blood flow are also compromised.[110] drugs that are excreted through glomerular filtration and are potentially toxic in the elderly
include digoxin, lithium, aminoglycosides, procainamide, cimetidine and  xxxd1678xxx . moreover, in the elderly, a normal serum creatinine does
not mean good glomerular filtration, or rather it can
be misleading because it is slowed in individuals
with decreased muscle mass. therefore, determination of creatinine clearance is desirable, and a fast
method is using a formula (see below), although
direct determination based on 24-hour urine collection is preferable.[94,111,112]
creatinine clearance = (140 – age in years) ×
bodyweight (kg)/72 × plasma creatinine (mg/dl).
4.1.4 pharmacodynamics

some drugs may have different pharmacological
effects in the elderly than they do in the young.
there are various reasons, including changes in the
number of receptors and in binding affinity and the
deficits in homeostatic mechanisms, that is, all the
hormonal, biochemical and nervous compensatory
reflexes limiting drug effect.[94,113] so, for example,
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

an elderly individual may experience orthostatic
hypotension following administration of an antihypertensive drug, because of reduced autonomic
function.[90]
geriatric patients frequently have medical conditions such as dementia, hypoalbuminaemia and
chronic renal failure, which can alter pharmacological response. all these changes have to be taken into
account, and they explain why, for example, elderly
persons are more sensitive to benzodiazepine or
antipsychotic effects, experiencing stronger sedation even with lower plasma concentrations of these
drugs than those required for a sedative effect in
younger persons. in other words, when considering
therapy in elderly patients, we need to be careful to
try to achieve an efficacious pharmacological response with the lowest dosage.
5. characteristics of
individual antipsychotics
as mentioned in section 4, conventional and
atypical antipsychotics show significant differences
both in receptor binding profile and in pharmacokinetic characteristics; we have focused in particular
on some of them. a medline search was made using
the following keywords: conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, elderly, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, side effects. the research
was restricted to the last 5 years; further data on the
drugs were obtained from micromedex® healthcare
series (micromedex inc., englewood, co,
usa).[114] in addition, we included some studies that
were referenced in reports from our pharmacovigilance centre.

bound, especially to alpha1-acid glycoprotein, and is

and in the elderly. haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx  is a longlasting intramuscular injection used for long-term
treatment of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.[115,116]
haloperidol can be administered orally, intramuscularly or intravenously; it is well absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract. first-pass metabolism in the liver reduces the bioavailability to approximately 60%, while the bioavailability of the
lactate formulation is 75% when it is given intramuscularly. peak plasma concentrations after oral

eps frequently occur during treatment with haloperidol and seem to be a result of d2-receptor blockade. it is not well known why they occur less frequently after intravenous than after intramuscular or
oral administration. they are classified as dystonic
reactions, akathisia and pseudoparkinsonism (i.e.
reduced motor activity, resting tremors, hip rigidity,
hypersalivation and postural abnormalities). dystonic reactions usually occur 24–96 hours after the
beginning of treatment and involve 30–64% of treated patients. akathisia occurs in 25–26% of patients
treated with high-potency antipsychotics and generally develops in several days to weeks; it may respond to dose reduction or to concomitant administration of a benzodiazepine (usually lorazepam) or a
beta-blocker
(e.g.
propranolol,
metoprolol).
pseudoparkinsonism usually appears 1–2 weeks after the beginning of treatment; its incidence is
15%–36% and it appears especially in the elderly
and in women. dystonia and pseudoparkinsonism
are usually treated with an anticholinergic agent
such as benzatropine or diphenhydramine. neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms) may rarely occur
in patients receiving haloperidol. tardive dyskinesia, sometimes irreversible, may appear particularly
in elderly women with medical conditions. other
adverse effects are somnolence (tolerance usually
develops after prolonged therapy), hyperprolactinaemia (with gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea,
impotence, infertility and ejaculation dysfunction),
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

306

gareri et al.

retinopathy, melanosis and haematological disturbances (anaemia, leucopenia and leucocytosis). cardiovascular adverse effects include hypertension,
ventricular tachycardia, qt prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (frequently with large dosages, e.g. >100 mg/day). qt interval corrected for heart rate (qtc) is prolonged, especially in critically ill patients, when haloperidol is
administered intravenously.[117]
haloperidol is widely used in the treatment of
schizophrenia, delusional disorders, dementia, agitation, aggression and chronic psychoses in elderly
patients. two studies have compared it with the
newer antipsychotic risperidone in the treatment of
behavioural disorders in demented patients.[118,119]
both studies demonstrated treatment failure and
eps more frequently with haloperidol than with
risperidone. eps are also more frequent in elderly
demented than nondemented patients.[120] recently,
haloperidol has been shown to have lower efficacy
than intramuscular olanzapine for treating agitation
in schizophrenia.[121] the mean dosage in the elderly
is 1.5–2mg/day; the maximum recommended dosage is 5–7 mg/day.[122]
6.2 chlorpromazine

chlorpromazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine
used mainly as an antipsychotic. it is the prototype
of the antipsychotic agents. it is rapidly absorbed
after oral administration, but there is considerable
individual patient variation in peak plasma concentrations, because the drug undergoes metabolism in
the gastric mucosa and during the first pass through
the liver. after oral ingestion, onset of sedation
occurs within 30–60 minutes and lasts for 4–18
hours. chlorpromazine is 92%–97% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha1-acid glycoprotein; it
crosses the placenta and distributes to breast milk. it
is extensively metabolised to produce more than 100
metabolites, some of which, such as 7-hydroxychlorpromazine, have pharmacological activity.
mean plasma half-life is 27–37 hours, and the drug
undergoes enterohepatic cycling. excretion is
primarily renal and elimination is via the biliary
tract and faeces.
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

clinical indications are represented by the treatment of psychotic disorders (schizophrenia,
schizoaffective abnormalities) and severe behavioural abnormalities (also in adolescents).[122] eps
also occur frequently during treatment with phenothiazines because of d2-receptor blockade, especially during high-dose use. somnolence, dizziness, migraine, cerebral oedema and seizures may frequently
appear. anticholinergic effects include blurred vision, xerostomia, mydriasis, nausea, adynamic ileus,
urinary retention, impotence and constipation.
leucopenia, including agranulocytosis, is the
haematological disorder that has been reported most
frequently during phenothiazine treatment. allergic
reactions, including obstructive jaundice, have been
reported with chlorpromazine. it usually develops
within 3–4 weeks of initiating drug treatment and is
associated with skin reactions, jaundice, fever and
eosinophilia. prolonged therapy with phenothiazines can lead to skin hyperpigmentation, photosensitivity and pigmentary retinopathy. hyperprolactinaemia and cardiovascular adverse effects
are analogous to those reported for haloperidol.[91]
mean dosage in the elderly is 25–75 mg/day.[123]
6.3 thioridazine

thioridazine is a piperidine phenothiazine indicated for the treatment of schizophrenic patients
who fail to respond adequately to treatment with
other antipsychotic drugs. it has also been used for
the treatment of dementia, organic brain syndrome
and, together with antidepressants, for the treatment
of depression, although these are not approved indications. the mean oral dosage in adults is
50–100mg three times daily up to a maximum of
800 mg/day, while elderly patients usually require
lower dosages (mean recommended dosage is
30–50 mg/day).[122].
therapeutic blood levels range from 140 to
660 mug/l 3 hours after a single dose of 100mg. peak
serum levels are reached within 1 hour and levels
may persist for 100–120 hours after withdrawal of
the drug; the elimination half-life is 21–24 hours.
thioridazine undergoes extensive hepatic metaboclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

lism to active and inactive compounds, with minimal excretion of unchanged drug in the urine.
in the elderly, particular attention should be given to the use of concomitant medications that prolong the qtc interval, since thioridazine has been
shown to prolong the qtc interval in a dose-related
manner and may be associated with torsade de
pointes-type arrhythmias and sudden death. other
adverse effects include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, hypotension, confusion,
tardive dyskinesia, eps, nms, nausea, vomiting,
parotitis, sexual dysfunction, retinopathy, skin discoloration and phototoxicity. in particular, elderly
patients should be treated with reduced doses of
thioridazine and closely monitored for excessive
parkinsonian adverse effects. significantly higher
plasma concentrations (1.5- to 2-fold higher) were
reported in elderly patients (mean age 76 years) than
in young adults.[123] adverse effects (postural hypotension, dry mouth) were more frequent and severe
in the elderly.[124] concurrent use of anticholinergic
agents (benzatropine, orphenadrine,  xxxd3019xxx ,
trihexyphenidyl) to control eps may reduce the
absorption of thioridazine and antagonise its behavioural and antipsychotic effects, together with enhancing anticholinergic adverse effects. this occurs
particularly in the elderly, in whom anticholinergic
adverse effects are more severe (ileus, excessive
sedation, dry mouth, hyperpyrexia). therefore, its
use in the elderly requires caution.
6.4  xxxd3024xxx 

 xxxd3024xxx  is an aliphatic phenothiazine antipsychotic agent, with a low-potency antidopaminergic action, alpha1-adrenergic antagonism and anticholinergic properties. it is rapidly absorbed after oral
administration; peak plasma concentrations occur at
between 2 and 4 hours and its plasma half-life is
about 6 hours.  xxxd3024xxx  is highly bound to plasma
proteins, especially albumin. it undergoes hepatic
metabolism and is eliminated via the kidneys.[123]
 xxxd3024xxx  is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, paranoid states, mania, toxic psychosis (caused
by amphetamines,  xxxd2527xxx  [lsd], cocaine),
mental organic disorders with delirium, severe anxi© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

ety refractory to benzodiazepines, and depression
associated with psychomotor agitation and delusions. in elderly demented patients it is usually
administered when behavioural disturbances occur.[125] on the other hand, it may increase the
sedative effects of benzodiazepines, hypnotics,
anaesthetics and antihistaminic agents.[91] its main
adverse effects are sedation, somnolence, insomnia,
anxiety, agitation, seizures, various anticholinergic
effects (caution is required in association with anticholinergic drugs), eps, dizziness, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, syncope, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hyperprolactinaemia, cholestatic jaundice and nms. mean dosage in the elderly
is 15–60 mg/day.[122]
6.5 fluphenazine

fluphenazine is a piperazine phenothiazine antipsychotic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. following intramuscular administration of
fluphenazine dihydrochloride, peak serum levels are
achieved at 1.5–2 hours. intramuscular fluphenazine
enanthate produces peak serum levels on days 2–3,
whereas intramuscular fluphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  produces peak levels on day 1. the half-life of oral
fluphenazine is about 33 hours, and that of
fluphenazine enanthate is about 3.5–4 days. the
elimination half-life of fluphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  is
6.8–9.6 days after a single injection and increases to
at least 14 days after multiple injections.[123]
fluphenazine can be used in geriatric patients,
but at lower doses than in adults. elderly patients
should receive an initial oral dosage of 1–2.5 mg/
day of fluphenazine, or 12.5–25mg of intramuscular
fluphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  every 4 weeks.[91]
adverse reactions may include blood dyscrasias,
such as leucopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia. hypertension and fluctuations in blood
pressure have often been reported, and hypotension
has occurred rarely, as have tachycardia and oedema.
the most common cns adverse effects include
pseudoparkinsonism, dyskinesia, opisthotonus,
hyper-reflexia, dystonia and akathisia. these effects
appear to be dose related and can be alleviated by
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

gareri et al.

dosage reduction and/or use of anticholinergic medication. headache, cerebral oedema, drowsiness and
lethargy have also occurred, as well as altered eeg
tracings. the enanthate salt produces significant
eps more often than the  xxxd1821xxx  salt, probably
because of the longer duration of action of the
latter.[126,127] tardive dyskinesia, seizures and elevated prolactin levels are more prevalent in the
elderly, especially in women. furthermore, menstrual irregularities, impotence in men and increased
libido in women have occurred. nms and gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, hypersalivation, dry mouth, constipation, paralytic ileus
and weight gain have also occurred with
fluphenazine.[91]
in the elderly, care must be taken with the coadministration of other drugs, particularly those drugs
prolonging the qtc interval, because of the wellknown risks of increasing proarrhythmias.[91]
6.6 perphenazine

perphenazine is a piperazine phenothiazine antipsychotic agent used in the treatment of schizophrenia, psychoses, organic mental syndrome characterised by delusions, agitation and severe anxiety, and
psychosis and behavioural disturbances in demented
patients.[128] it blocks d2 receptors and presents a
high affinity for 5-ht2 and histaminic receptors,
whereas it has low adrenolytic and anticholinergic
activity.[91,123] it is quickly absorbed, with bioavailability of about 20%. peak plasma concentrations
occur 1–4 hours after oral administration, plasma
half-life is 8–21 hours, and the drug is excreted by
the kidneys. the enanthate form is administered
intramuscularly. extensive metabolism into several
metabolites occurs in the liver, by sulphoxidation,
hydroxylation, dealkylation and glucuronidation.
perphenazine metabolism is mediated by
cyp2d6.[91]
for treating schizophrenia and psychoses, recommended dosages in adults are 12–48 mg/day, whereas in elderly patients with psychotic manifestations
recommended dosages are one-third to one-half of
the usual adult dosage, whether given orally or
intramuscularly.[91] adverse effects are eps, seda© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

tion, anticholinergic effects, seizures, agranulocytosis, endocrine effects, tardive dyskinesia and liver
damage. caution is especially required in the elderly
because of postural hypotension as a result of antiadrenergic activity, and muscle weakness; an increased incidence of hip fracture has been reported
in elderly patients.[91]
6.7  xxxd3568xxx 

 xxxd3568xxx  is a thioxanthene antipsychotic
with d1 and d2 antagonism, high affinity for 5-ht2
receptors and low adrenolytic, muscarinic and histaminic activity. peak plasma concentrations occur
2–4 hours after oral administration, with a plasma
half-life of 20 hours. metabolites have no pharmacological activity.  xxxd3568xxx  is also available
as  xxxd1821xxx , esterified with a fatty acid and slowly
released (long-lasting, about 3 weeks), and as acetate, which is highly lipophilic. the acetate is administered intramuscularly, slowly spreads in tissues and undergoes enzymatic degradation with formation of active  xxxd3568xxx .
 xxxd3568xxx  is used in schizophrenia when
hallucinations, hostility, aggression and delusions
dominate the clinical picture, in mania and in organic mental disorders (i.e. mental insufficiency, senile
dementia). it is frequently used in the elderly, although caution is required, especially if cardiovascular disease, renal failure or history of seizures are
present.[91,123] mean recommended dosages in the
elderly are 2–6 mg/day; dosage may be increased as
needed up to 10–20 mg/day.[91,123] adverse effects
include dystonic reactions, akathisia, tremors, sedation, depression, confusion, hallucinations, increased transaminases and rarely tardive dyskinesia.
especially in the elderly, caution is required because
of the frequent presence of cardiovascular effects
such as hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness and orthostatic syncope, and autonomic effects such as
xerostomia, urinary retention, constipation and accommodation disturbances.[91,123]
6.8 levosulpiride

levosulpiride is a benzamide and a dopamine
agonist. it is used at low doses in dysthymia and at
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

higher doses as an antipsychotic. it undergoes rapid
absorption, with peak plasma concentrations occurring in 1–5 hours. plasma half-life is biphasic, with a
rapid phase of 2–5 hours and a slow phase of 15–18
hours. steady state occurs in 48–72 hours. levosulpiride undergoes hepatic metabolism, which leads to
inactive compounds, and is excreted by the kidneys,
mostly as an unmodified compound.[91,123]
the adverse effects of levosulpiride are particularly marked in the elderly and include sedation and
hypotension, as well as precocious dyskinesia (stiff
neck, oculogyric crises, trismus), eps requiring antiparkinsonian treatment, tardive dyskinesia (observed in the case of prolonged treatment) and some
endocrine effects, such as hyperprolactinaemia,
galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. it may also potentiate the effects of antihypertensive, hypnotic and
analgesic drugs. mean dosage in the elderly is
100–200 mg/day.[91,123]
6.9 tiapride

tiapride is a derivative of the substituted
benzamide series of antipsychotics, characterised by
a high affinity for d2 receptors, whereas it has no
affinity for adrenergic, cholinergic and histaminic
receptors. it is rapidly absorbed after oral and intramuscular administration, with peak plasma concentrations after 60 and 30 minutes, respectively.[91,123]
tiapride has a plasma half-life of about 3–4 hours
and undergoes renal excretion in 24 hours. it is
particularly effective in behavioural disorders in the
elderly at dosages of 100–300 mg/day, with less
tendency to cause eps compared with haloperidol.[91,128]
the main adverse effects are an increase in serum
prolactin, somnolence, sleep disorders, dyskinesia,
eps, allergic dermatitis, muscle pains and, rarely,
postural hypotension. sedation and hypotension are
the most common adverse effects in the elderly.[91]

it is slowly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring 8 hours after oral administration.
 xxxd2956xxx  undergoes hepatic metabolism, without
active metabolites, and has a long plasma half-life
(about 50–60 hours).[91,123]
in the elderly, the half-life may be longer; therefore, careful dosage adjustment and continuous
monitoring of adverse effects are required. adverse
effects are mild eps, and rarely sedation, somnolence, impotence and skin eruptions.[91]  xxxd2956xxx 
may enhance the sedative action of anxiolytics and
hypnotics, and the response to sulphonylureas and
antiepileptics may be decreased. the activity of
antihypertensive drugs may be potentiated. caution
must be exercised in patients, especially the elderly,
treated with antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, diuretics
or antihistamines, because of the risk of ventricular
arrhythmias.
 xxxd2956xxx  is used in psychoses when aggression,
psychomotor agitation or severe anxiety are not the
most important symptoms. it has also been shown to
be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia
induced by prolonged administration of phenothiazines.[129] mean dosage in the elderly is 2–4 mg/
day.[91,123]
7. atypical antipsychotics
7.1  xxxd155xxx 

 xxxd155xxx  is an alkylsulphone derivative of the
substituted benzamide series of antipsychotics, with
high affinity for presynaptic d2/d3 dopamine receptors,[130] whereas it has no affinity for serotonergic,
alpha1-adrenergic, histaminic or cholinergic receptors.
low doses of this drug may improve negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients and are also used in
the treatment of patients with dysthymia, by enhancing dopaminergic transmission at the level of the
mesolimbic system.[131] high dosages (≥600 mg/
day) have antidopaminergic activity and are therefore used for treating positive psychotic symptoms
or acute delusional attacks.[131]
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

gareri et al.

 xxxd155xxx  is rapidly absorbed and peak plasma
concentrations in the elderly occur 1.5–2 hours after
oral administration.[91] food has modest effects on
its absorption.[132] it is poorly protein-bound
(11%–17%) and its plasma concentrations decrease
in a biphasic manner, with a first cmax between 2–5
hours and a second beween 15–18 hours.[91,123]
 xxxd155xxx  is weakly metabolised, with two inactive metabolites, undergoing n-dealkylation and oxidation; 70% of this drug is excreted by the kidneys.[91] the elimination half-life is 12–17 hours.[132]
 xxxd155xxx  has a low occurrence of eps because of its preferential binding to dopamine receptors in extrastriatal regions rather than in the striatum.[133] because  xxxd155xxx  can cause sedation
and hypotension, caution should be used in geriatric
patients. increases of half-life, maximum plasma
concentration and area under the concentration-time
curve were observed after a single oral dose of 50mg
in these patients.[91] furthermore, in the elderly,
somnolence, sleep disorders, precocious and tardive
dyskinesia, endocrinological effects (hyperprolactinaemia, galactorrhoea, gynaecomastia) and
allergic dermatitis are often observed.[123]
7.2 clotiapine

clotiapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent with
a tricyclic structure of the dibenzothiapine type; its
general properties are similar to those of phenothiazines. it has a high affinity for d2 and 5-ht2
receptors; moreover, it has adrenolytic, anticholinergic and antihistaminic activity.[91]
clotiapine is well absorbed after oral administration, is extensively metabolised and a major portion
is excreted in the urine. its elimination half-life is
about 8 hours. it is especially used in psychoses and
schizophrenia and its efficacy has been well known
for several years.[134] common adverse effects include fatigue, drowsiness, tremor, constipation,
tardive dyskinesia, eps and nms. other effects are
postural hypotension, tachycardia, syncope, severe
muscle stiffness, seizures and trouble with breathing. its use in the elderly requires caution, and low
dosages (10–30 mg/day) should be used,[91,123] espe© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

cially when prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma or paralytic ileus are present.[91]
7.3 clozapine

clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine derivative structurally related to  xxxd2511xxx ; despite typical antipsychotic effects, it has greater specificity for the
limbic system and a low incidence of eps. clozapine was the first atypical agent to be proven in the
treatment of schizophrenia refractory to other medications, but it has the disadvantage of causing severe
adverse effects such as agranulocytosis, which can
be fatal.
it is rapidly absorbed after oral administration,
and only 27%–50% of a dose reaches the systemic
circulation because of significant first-pass metabolism.[135,136] various individual factors can alter response, such as smoking, hepatic metabolism, gastric absorption, age and sex. smoking cigarettes
(tobacco) increases the clearance of clozapine and
may result in a substantial reduction in plasma clozapine concentration.[137] clozapine is rapidly and
extensively distributed; it crosses the blood-brain
barrier and 95% is bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha1-acid glycoprotein. steady state is reached
in about 7–10 days. many weeks may be required
for the onset of the antipsychotic effect, but maximum effects are obtained several months after the
beginning of treatment. metabolism occurs primarily via the cyp1a2 and cyp3a4 hepatic microsomal enzymes and leads to two metabolites, norclozapine and clozapine-n-oxide. the mean terminal half-life is 6–33 hours; about 50% of a dose is
excreted in the urine and 30% in the faeces, but only
small amounts consist of unchanged drug.[135]
agranulocytosis, defined as an absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3, is the most severe adverse
effect, and treatment should not be initiated if the
baseline white blood cell count is <3500/mm3. furthermore, clozapine lowers the seizure threshold and
may precipitate grand mal seizures, particularly at
dosages greater than 600 mg/day or after dosage
increases greater than 100 mg/day. clozapine is less
likely to cause eps than typical antipsychotic
agents, but should be used with caution in patients

antipsychotics in the elderly

with prostatic hypertrophy, paralytic ileus, closedangle glaucoma or urinary retention, because it has
strong anticholinergic activity that can exacerbate
these conditions. clozapine must be used with caution in patients with cardiac and/or pulmonary diseases; indeed, it may frequently induce tachycardia
and orthostatic hypotension, and therefore it must be
prescribed carefully in the elderly.[136] furthermore,
a number of studies have reported that clozapine
may increase the plasma glucose level in patients
with or without a prior history of diabetes mellitus.[138-140] the possible mechanisms of onset of
diabetes are presented in table vii. weight gain and
elevations in serum triglycerides were also widely
observed in patients treated with clozapine.[141-143]
on the other hand, according to several studies,
diabetes mellitus may be more common in schizophrenic patients than among the general population.[144] there have been at least 20 case reports of
diabetes induced or exacerbated by clozapine; diabetic ketoacidosis was the presenting symptom in
ten cases.[138,145] another very common adverse effect is excessive sedation or somnolence. abrupt
discontinuation of clozapine is not recommended,
unless required by the patient’s medical condition
(e.g. leucopenia).
clozapine is used in schizophrenia refractory to
other medications and in bipolar disorder. at very
low doses, it has been shown to be very effective for
the management of psychosis in elderly patients
with parkinson’s disease,[146] and it is also effective
in elderly schizophrenic and demented patients.
recommended dosages in the elderly range from 25
to 150 mg/day.[147]

and

7.4 risperidone

risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative, is a
first-line oral antipsychotic agent. at therapeutic
dosages, the combined 5-ht2a and d2 antagonism
of risperidone is thought to be responsible for its
effectiveness on positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia and its lack of eps. these are its main
advantages compared with other currently available
antipsychotics.[136,148] in the limbic system, a dopamine excess is responsible for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia; in the mesocortical tract,
dopamine blockade may be responsible for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. in the nigrostriatal
pathway, dopamine blockade is known to cause
eps. therefore, risperidone may antagonise dopamine receptors in the limbic system only, thus
treating positive symptoms. on the contrary, in the
mesocortical tract risperidone exhibits selective
 xxxg1113xxx  blockade, which causes an excess of
dopamine and an increase in dopamine transmission, thus having an effect on negative symptoms.[148] since risperidone does not affect dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, except at very
high doses, eps are usually avoided, although there
is individual variability. another dose-related adverse effect is dopamine receptor blockade in the
tubero-infundibular tract, resulting in prolactin release, weight gain and menstrual irregularity.
alpha1-receptor blockade may cause hypotension and
this has to be especially taken into account when an
elderly person is treated.
risperidone is administered orally without any
regard to meals. peak plasma concentrations are
achieved within 1–2 hours and are dose proportional.[148,149] risperidone is metabolised via the
cyp2d6 hepatic microsomal isoenzyme ( xxxd1818xxx  hydrolase) and also via dealkylation; its main
metabolite, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, is active. both
risperidone and 9-hydroxy-risperidone are highly
protein bound. all drugs inhibiting or inducing
cyp2d6 may affect the plasma levels of both compounds, and therefore the incidence of adverse effects and the efficacy of risperidone (table v).
cyp3a4 and  xxxg592xxx  microsomal isoenzymes
have also been shown to metabolise risperidone to
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

312

9-hydroxy-risperidone; the former is the most abundant of the liver cyp isoenzymes and is
polymorphically expressed, appearing in only about
one-fourth of human livers.[150] therefore, the contribution of cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 to the metabolism of risperidone may have significant value in
predicting potential drug-drug interactions in the
clinical use of risperidone, as can occur in elderly
patients with polypathology. polymorphism of metabolic enzymes, together with decreases in hepatic
blood flow and renal clearance, may lead to increased blood levels of risperidone in the elderly.[151]
risperidone and 9-hydroxy-risperidone have halflives of about 3 and 24 hours, respectively. steady
state for risperidone occurs after 1 day, whereas for
9-hydroxy-risperidone it occurs after 4.5 days. excretion is mainly via the kidneys and a small amount
is eliminated in the urine. half-life is prolonged in
patients with hepatic or renal disease.
in the elderly, an initial dosage of 0.5mg twice
daily is recommended; if strictly necessary, increases of 0.5 mg/day or twice daily are well tolerated. however, as is also the case in adults, the effectiveness of dosages above 6 mg/day have not been
demonstrated and such doses are associated with an
increased risk for eps.[91]
this atypical antipsychotic agent is commonly
used in the treatment of psychotic disorders in the
elderly.[152] it has also been found to be very effective in the treatment of some behavioural disorders
such as agitation, aggression and wandering in patients with dementia. in fact, risperidone at dosages
of 1–2 mg/day seemed to be effective in reducing
noncognitive psychiatric and behavioural symptoms
in demented patients.[33,119,125,153-157] recently, it has
been shown that crossover from haloperidol to risperidone is generally safe and effective and may
produce favourable moods in agitated demented patients.[158] madhusoodanan et al.[159] showed very
good efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of 103 elderly patients with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorders. at present, few data are
available on long-term results; davidson et al.[160]
carried out an open-label, long-term study evaluating the effects of risperidone in elderly psychotic

gareri et al.

patients. results suggest that long-term treatment
with risperidone is associated with a continuous
improvement, a decrease in severity of pre-existing
eps and a low incidence of tardive dyskinesia.
several studies have also shown positive effects on
cognition, especially in elderly patients;[161,162] this
is probably because of the lack of antimuscarinic
activity.
adverse effects have to be carefully monitored,
particularly in elderly patients. arterial hypotension
(and in elderly patients especially orthostatic hypotension) is a result of alpha1-receptor blockade. this
adverse effect is more frequent at the beginning of
treatment and is characterised by the onset of dizziness, sinus tachycardia or syncope. the incidence of
eps (akathisia, dystonic reactions, pseudoparkinsonism) is much lower with risperidone (roughly
2.1%) than with other antipsychotics such as haloperidol. this is probably because of the high serotonin antagonism exhibited by risperidone, counteracting its dopaminergic activity.[136] the low incidence of eps is dose related, and dosages above
10 mg/day increase the risk of inducing these symptoms.[136] it is also possible that risperidone may
mask the signs and symptoms of developing tardive
dyskinesia. these symptoms may emerge on withdrawal of the drug. nms occurs in a few patients
receiving risperidone. several predisposing factors,
such as heat stress, physical exhaustion, dehydration
and organic brain disease (frequently present in an
elderly individual) can contribute to the development of nms. seizures were reported in 0.3% of
patients.[136]
both risperidone and its metabolite  xxxd2830xxx  are known to prolong the qtc interval,
so other drugs known to prolong this interval should
be avoided or very carefully administered.[163] this
can occur especially in the elderly, in whom
polypathology and polytherapy are often present;[153] drugs usually involved are certain antiarrhythmics (such as quinidine,  xxxd2113xxx , amiodarone, sotalol and verapamil), other antipsychotics (haloperidol and phenothiazines), tricyclic
antidepressants, antihistamines (terfenadine and asclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

temizole), some antibiotics (grepafloxacin and
erythromycin), cocaine,  xxxd3014xxx  and ketoconazole.
somnolence was reported in 8% of treated patients.[33] rare adverse effects are photosensitivity,
constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, reduced or increased salivation, blurred vision, fatigue, impotence and ejaculation dysfunction.
recently, the onset of diabetes was shown in two
patients treated with risperidone; however, these
patients had a family history of diabetes and obesity
and the disease occurred 1 year after the beginning
of treatment. this is partly in contrast with the time
to onset of diabetes observed during treatment with
other antipsychotics, such as clozapine and
olanzapine (20 weeks). furthermore, the increase in
adipose tissue may have contributed to insulin resistance and to the onset of diabetes, and these patients
were treated with several drugs.[164]
7.5 olanzapine

olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent
similar to clozapine in chemical structure and in
mechanism of action. it is administered orally, and
an intramuscular formulation of olanzapine is currently available in some countries for the treatment
of acute psychotic symptoms and of acutely agitated
demented patients.[165] the drug is well absorbed
and peak serum concentrations are reached in approximately 6 hours. there is extensive first-pass
metabolism, with about 40% of a dose being metabolised before reaching the systemic circulation.
steady-state concentrations are reached after approximately 1 week of continuous administration.
olanzapine is 93% bound to plasma proteins,
primarily to albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein.[136]
olanzapine
is
primarily
metabolised
by
glucuronidation and cyp oxidation, the involved
microsomal enzymes being cyp1a2 and cyp2d6.
neither metabolite has any pharmacological activity. the elimination half-life averages 30 hours, and
57% and 30% of a dose is recovered in the urine and
faeces, respectively.
the more common adverse effects are somnolence in 26% of patients, dizziness, agitation, constipation, akathisia, postural hypotension and weight

313

gain. tardive dyskinesia occurs in about 1% of
patients treated with olanzapine and is sometimes
irreversible. akathisia and other eps occur more
frequently with dosages greater than 10 mg/day.
the most common cardiovascular adverse effect is
orthostatic hypotension, which occurs in about 5.5%
of patients treated and may also be the cause of
dizziness. elevation of hepatic enzymes generally
occurs in 9.2% of patients receiving olanzapine.
other rarely reported adverse effects are sexual dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis and hyperglycaemia. in
particular, hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus and
ketoacidosis are widely known to be induced by
olanzapine.[139,140,166] in the reported cases, hyperglycaemia was present only during treatment, and
treatment withdrawal resulted in regression of
symptoms. however, the reintroduction of treatment
(rechallenge) caused a new onset of diabetes. family history was negative for this disease.[140] latency
time was also constant among the cases (about 16
weeks). the possible mechanisms of onset of diabetes are presented in table vii. both schizophrenia
itself and the older antipsychotic medications have
been reported to be associated with a similar risk for
causing disruption in serum glucose control. diabetes also has well-recognised associations with a
number of medical disorders such as cardiovascular
disease; therefore it is worthy of attention. fifteen
cases of diabetes following olanzapine treatment
have been reported in the literature.[166]
a number of studies suggest that olanzapine is
safe in treating adult patients of any age with schizophrenia, acute bipolar mania and behavioural and
psychological symptoms of dementia.[167-170] compared with risperidone, it has shown improvement in
social functioning in elderly patients with dementia[171] and psychosis, but it has more adverse effects, such as cognitive deterioration, glucose metabolism disorders and decreased blood pressure.[170]
other studies have shown that  xxxg1119xxx  antagonism by
olanzapine causes acetylcholine release, thus improving cognitive functions.[172]
recent studies suggest a role for olanzapine in
the acute treatment of psychotic mood disorders.[173]
an intramuscular formulation of olanzapine has
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

314

been developed because there are no rapid-acting
intramuscular atypical antipsychotic drugs currently
available in the us for treating acute agitation in
schizophrenic patients.[121] premarketing studies included few elderly patients; therefore, further data
are required in the elderly, especially in patients
with comorbidity.
madhusoodanan and co-workers[174] demonstrated the efficacy and safety of olanzapine (5–20 mg/
day) in 11 hospitalised elderly patients aged between 60 and 85 years with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder. solomos and geiger[175]
conducted a retrospective study in 58 elderly patients with psychotic symptoms refractory to conventional antipsychotics; 60.3% of them responded
to treatment with olanzapine. compared with young
adults, elderly patients may have a 6-fold higher
prevalence of tardive dyskinesia when treated with
olanzapine.
as mentioned above, a number of studies have
shown the efficacy of low dosages of olanzapine
(5–10 mg/day) in the treatment of psychosis and/or
aggression and psychomotor agitation in
alzheimer’s disease.[167-169,176] somnolence and
weight gain were frequently observed; no increase
in cognitive dysfunction, eps or central anticholinergic effects was found at the dosages administered.
wolters and co-workers[177] showed that, in 15
patients with parkinson’s disease and a drug-induced psychosis, psychotic symptoms decreased
without evidence of a worsening of eps. similar
results were reported by aarsland et al.[178]
few data have been published from controlled
studies of risperidone compared with olanzapine in
elderly psychotic patients. madhusoodanan et al.[159]
analysed data collected on 151 elderly hospitalised
psychiatric patients, 114 treated with risperidone
and 37 with olanzapine. response to treatment, interruption of treatment and adverse effects were
similar in the two groups. furthermore, olanzapine
does not contribute to qtc prolongation in psychotic
patients.[160] recommended dosages in elderly patients are 5–20 mg/day.[147]

7.6 quetiapine

quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine structurally
similar to clozapine. it has good efficacy on positive
and negative psychotic symptoms, without producing eps.[179,180] quetiapine is administered orally, is
rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentration is
achieved in about 1.5 hours; about 83% is bound to
plasma protein. it is largely metabolised in the liver,
and less than 1% of a dose is excreted unchanged.
the main metabolites are a sulphoxide inactive metabolite, produced by cyp3a4, and an acid metabolite produced by oxidation. mean plasma half-life is
about 6 hours and clearance is reduced by 40% in
the elderly.
therapeutic indications are treatment of psychotic and behavioural disorders. quetiapine may cause
orthostatic hypotension (because of alpha1-receptor
blockade), associated with dizziness, tachycardia
and, in rare cases, syncope. it should be used carefully in patients with heart disease, particularly
those with heart failure, previous history of myocardial infarction or conduction abnormalities. quetiapine rarely causes eps, such as akathisia, tremors
and hypokinesia. it more frequently causes weight
gain, somnolence, constipation, xerostomia and dyspepsia. however, it was recently shown that longterm monotherapy with quetiapine is associated
with a potentially normalising effect on weight, with
a tendency towards weight gain in underweight patients and weight loss in severely obese patients.[181]
the onset of seizures was demonstrated in 0.8% of
patients treated with quetiapine. it is associated with
dose-dependent reductions in total and free thyroxine and transient increases in hepatic enzymes (especially aspartate aminotransaminase).
madhusoodanan and co-workers[182] showed the
efficacy of quetiapine in seven elderly hospitalised
patients aged 61–72 years with schizophrenia-related psychotic symptoms, schizoaffective disorder or
bipolar disorder. four patients responded to treatment; transient hypotension, dizziness and somnolence were the most frequently observed adverse
effects. no eps were found. the long-term efficacy
and safety of quetiapine in elderly patients with
psychosis has been studied by some authors.[183,184]
clin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

no cardiovascular adverse effects were observed;
qtc interval changes on ecg are not frequent and
patients who begin treatment with this drug do not
require an ecg. treatment-related eps were no
more frequent than those observed with placebo.[185]
recommended dosages in elderly patients are
50–300 mg/day.[147]
7.7 ziprasidone

ziprasidone is a new antipsychotic agent with a
high ratio of  xxxg1113xxx  blockade to  xxxg656xxx 
blockade. it can be used intramuscularly in the treatment of acute psychosis, or orally, and is effective
on both positive and negative symptoms and in
affective symptoms. ziprasidone is usually more
effective in reducing the symptoms of psychosis and
better tolerated than haloperidol, especially in
movement disorders.[186] given orally, it is rapidly
absorbed; steady-state serum concentrations are
achieved within 2–3 days.[187] the influence of age
and sex on its pharmacokinetics is not clinically
significant. even mild to moderate renal and hepatic
impairment does not cause significant alterations of
its pharmacokinetics and therefore does not necessitate dose adjustment.[188,189] it may also have a more
favourable cognitive profile than traditional agents
in the elderly, because of its weak anticholinergic
effects.[190] unlike other newer agents, it does not
appear to be associated with weight gain in most
patients and shows a low risk of neurological and
neuroendocrinological adverse effects.[191] it also
causes no change in glucose utilisation and seems to
bring about a reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.[192] it may increase the qtc interval.[193]
recommended dosages in elderly patients are
20–40 mg/day.[194]
7.8  xxxd3096xxx 

 xxxd3096xxx  is an atypical antipsychotic. it is a
pure enantiomer, without any action on 5-ht2a
receptors. after oral administration, the drug is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, with bioavailability above 90%.[195] it has no first-pass metabolism, its apparent volume of distribution is 0.7 l/kg,
and it is about 80% bound to plasma proteins, main© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

315

ly alpha1-acid glycoprotein.  xxxd3096xxx  has a plasma
half-life in the range of 4–7 hours; no significant
changes in plasma half-life are found in the elderly.
it is eliminated by both hepatic metabolism and
renal excretion; more than 70% of the dose is recovered as urinary metabolites, while about 25% is
excreted unchanged. decreased renal function is
usually associated with an increase in  xxxd3096xxx 
plasma levels.[196] steady-state levels are achieved
within 2 days, and they increase linearly with dosages up to 600 mg/day. drug-drug pharmacokinetic
interactions with diazepam, alcohol (ethanol), biperiden and warfarin are not present.
the most common adverse effects are tiredness
and eps, especially in the elderly.[157]  xxxd3096xxx 
can be used in the treatment of psychosis and behavioural disturbances.[157] recommended dosages in
elderly patients are 50–100 mg/day.[197]
7.9 zotepine

zotepine is an antipsychotic drug acting on d1,
d2 and 5-ht2 receptors; it is also bound to alpha1- and
h1-receptors and is able to inhibit noradrenaline
reuptake. it is administered orally, usually three
times daily at the conventional dosages. it is well
absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations are achieved 2–3 hours after administration. zotepine undergoes extensive firstpass metabolism, producing inactive metabolites
and the active metabolite norzotepine. hepatic
microsomal cyp1a2 and cyp3a4 are the main
isoenzymes involved in zotepine metabolism. it is
highly bound to plasma proteins (97%) and is excreted by the kidneys; its half-life is about 14 hours.
zotepine should be used carefully in the elderly,
since some severe adverse effects, such as tachycardia, hypotension, prolongation of qtc interval, somnolence and sleep disorders, have been reported.
parkinsonian adverse effects were reported in about
5.3% of patients treated; in prone patients, seizures
were observed, especially at high doses.[198] weight
gain, constipation, urinary retention, mydriasis and
hepatotoxicity were sometimes described. two
cases of deep vein thrombosis were seen in patients
receiving combined paroxetine and zotepine therclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

apy.[199] zotepine seems to be active especially
against negative symptoms of schizophrenia and in
the prevention of recurrence in patients with chronic
schizophrenia.[200] recommended dosages in elderly
patients are 75–150 mg/day.[91]
7.10  xxxd3195xxx 

 xxxd3195xxx  is a novel antipsychotic agent that was
removed from the market in december 1998 because of reports of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden
death.[201] it is implicated in the development of
torsade de pointes, as a result of lengthened qtc
interval. figure 3 shows its receptor-binding profile.
it is well absorbed, with bioavailability of 75%, is
99% protein bound and is metabolised in the liver by
cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 isoenzymes. its half-life
ranges from 55 to 90 hours.[91]  xxxd3195xxx  is effective
in the treatment of psychoses; indeed, it is effective
for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, with little or no motor impairment at therapeutic dosages. no dose adjustment is recommended in the elderly, since pharmacokinetic studies
showed no differences between young and elderly
individuals.[202] the main adverse effects are nasal
congestion, headache and insomnia; qt interval
prolongation, postural hypotension and transient
elevation of liver enzymes were sometimes observed.[91]
a recent study showed that  xxxd3195xxx  has more
antipsychotic activity than placebo, and is as well
tolerated as placebo and better tolerated than haloperidol;[203] it was associated with fewer movement
disorders than haloperidol, but was shown to cause
more weight gain.[203]  xxxd3195xxx  is now being reevaluated in a phase 4 study in patients with schizophrenia of all ages to assess whether it should be
reintroduced. it will initially be given only to patients enrolled in the clinical study; patients treated
with  xxxd3195xxx  will be carefully selected and monitored to maximise the benefits of treatment and
minimise any risks. therefore, there is no information about its use in the elderly. recently, a comparative study of mortality rates and cardiac arrhythmias in postmarketing surveillance studies of  xxxd3195xxx , risperidone and olanzapine was conducted.

although no statistically significant difference was
shown in mortality rates between  xxxd3195xxx  and
comparator cohorts, the  xxxd3195xxx  group was too
small to rule out an association between the use of
this drug and cardiovascular deaths.[204]
7.11 aripiprazole

aripiprazole is a new atypical antipsychotic
agent (quinolinone derivative) that exhibits partial
d2-receptor agonist activity;[204] in vitro data indicate its d2 agonist activity at presynaptic
autoreceptors, with antagonist activity at postsynaptic d2 receptors (regulating inhibition of camp
synthesis).[204] it seems to be useful in the treatment
of schizophrenia at dosages of 15–30 mg/day.
pharmacokinetic data are limited; peak plasma concentrations occur 3–5 hours after oral doses at
steady state. animal studies suggest hepatic metabolism; the elimination half-life is 48–68 hours during
multiple dosing and is not dose dependent.[205] eps
and prolactin increases have been uncommon in
available studies;[91,205] weight gain, nausea, vomiting and somnolence have been reported, but no
significant qt prolongation was observed.[91]
aripiprazole will compete with other atypical antipsychotics that are characterised by relatively good
efficacy and a low incidence of eps (i.e. risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine), and comparative
studies with these agents are required. no data are
available in the elderly.
8. conclusions
the principal brain target of all antipsychotic
drugs is the  xxxg656xxx ; in fact, the older
traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol,
chlorpromazine,  xxxd2956xxx , fluphenazine and
 xxxd2137xxx , bind more tightly than dopamine itself
to the  xxxg656xxx , with dissociation constants that
are lower than that of dopamine. therefore, they
induce extrapyramidal signs and symptoms and elevate serum prolactin. the newer atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,
quetiapine,  xxxd3096xxx  and ziprasidone, all bind
more loosely than dopamine to the  xxxg656xxx  and
have dissociation constants higher than that of dopclin drug invest 2003; 23 (5)

antipsychotics in the elderly

amine. as already shown by brain imaging findings,
through positron emission tomography scans, atypical antipsychotics clinically help patients by transiently occupying d2 receptors and then rapidly
dissociating to allow normal dopamine neurotransmission; they also block 5-ht2a receptors, thus
balancing serotonin and dopamine.[170] this effect is
remarkable, because it keeps prolactin levels normal, spares cognition and obviates eps. therefore,
the use of newer antipsychotics is particularly advantageous in the elderly for adequate control of
cognitive deficits and a decrease in eps, especially
if concomitant diseases and polypharmacy are present. on the other hand, the antipsychotic threshold
of occupancy of the  xxxg656xxx  for antipsychotic
action remains at about 65% for both typical and
atypical drugs, regardless of whether 5-ht2a receptors are blocked. recently, a number of studies have
reported that some atypical antipsychotics, especially clozapine and olanzapine, may cause increased
plasma glucose levels in patients with or without a
prior history of diabetes; other agents, such as quetiapine, may interfere with plasma levels of triglycerides.[138,192] therefore, careful monitoring of
these metabolic adverse effects is required, particularly in patients with medical diseases or a family
history of diabetes mellitus, or in elderly patients.
the use of antipsychotics in the elderly is an
indispensable means available to all physicians for
controlling the symptoms in psychoses, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders and behavioural disorders in demented patients. it is widely known that
dosages have to be strictly individualised in the
elderly; the changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics must be taken into account to avoid a
dangerous accumulation of the drug, with potential
for harmful adverse effects.
table viii presents mean recommended dosages
of some conventional and new antipsychotics in
various diseases (schizophrenia, parkinson’s disease
and dementia) for elderly patients.[91,123,147,206]
it is important to be alert for possible interactions
between drugs, particularly with some types of
drugs and in patients with different diseases and
polytherapies. elderly patients require an adequate
