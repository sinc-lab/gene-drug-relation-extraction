1 in this study we describe experiments to establish ex vivo the selectivity of non-steroidal antiin¯ammatory drugs (nsaids) given in vivo.
2 anaesthetised (inactin, 120 mg kg71) male wistar rats (220 ± 250 g) received an i.v. dose of one
of the following compounds (dose mg kg71): aspirin (20), diclofenac (3), l-745,337 (30),  xxxd2727xxx 
(15), salicylate (20),  xxxd3259xxx  (10). blood samples were taken before and up to 6 h after dosing and
the plasma obtained from it was tested for its ability to inhibit prostanoid formation in il-1btreated a549 cells (cox-2 system) and human washed platelets (cox-1 system). for control the
same compounds were also added directly to the assay systems.
3 all drugs, except  xxxd3219xxx , inhibited cox-1 and cox-2 when added directly to the test
systems. plasma from aspirin-treated rats was without eect on either cox-1 or cox-2, consistent
with the rapid in vivo metabolism to salicylate. conversely, plasma from  xxxd3259xxx -treated rats
inhibited cox-1 and cox-2 with potencies according with in vivo metabolism to  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide.
diclofenac was cox-1/2 non-selective when tested in vitro, but a slightly preferential inhibitor of
cox-2 when tested ex vivo.  xxxd2727xxx  was con®rmed as preferential inhibitor of cox-2 both in
vitro and ex vivo. l-745,337 was a selective cox-2 inhibitor when tested in vitro or ex vivo.
4 in conclusion, our experiments show clearly (a) nsaids inactivation, (b) activation of prodrugs, and (c) nsaids selectivity. our assay provides useful information about the selectivity of
nsaids that could be extended by the analysis of plasma samples taken from humans similarly
treated with test drugs.

introduction
prostanoids are formed initially by the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  to a common intermediate, prostaglandin
(pg) h2, by the enzyme prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase
(pghs) also known as cyclooxygenase (cox) (see vane et al.,
1998). this enzyme carries out two distinct reactions. the
cyclooxygenase activity forms pgg2 from  xxxd208xxx ,
while the peroxidase activity of pghs converts pgg2 to
pgh2. the subsequent formation of particular prostanoids
depends on the actions of speci®c isomerases acting upon
pgh2 (see hershman, 1996). following the discovery in the
early 1990s of an inducible isoform of cox (xie et al., 1991;
kujubu et al., 1991; wong et al., 1991; o'banion et al., 1991) it
is now known that cox exists in at least two isoforms. a
constitutive `house-keeping' enzyme, cox-1, which is responsible for homeostatic functions (moncada et al., 1976; whittle
et al., 1980) and an inducible isoform, cox-2, associated with
mitogenic events and in¯ammatory states (raz et al., 1988; fu
et al., 1990; masferr et al., 1990; o'banion et al., 1992; lee et
al., 1992; xie et al., 1992). as a re®nement of the mechanism
proposed by vane in 1971 it has therefore been suggested that
inhibition of cox-2 underlies the therapeutic ecacy of nonsteroidal anti-in¯ammatory drugs (nsaids) whilst inhibition
of cox-1 underlies their side eects (mitchell et al., 1993). the

potential therapeutic bene®t of cox-2 selective inhibitors has
encouraged the development of numerous in vitro test systems
in which to de®ne and develop both classical and novel
nsaids. the numerous in vitro test systems may be classed
into three main groups, puri®ed/recombinant enzymes (meade
et al., 1993), cultures of intact cells (cromlish et al., 1996) and
human whole blood (patrignani et al., 1994; 1997). although
all of these test systems have provided information about the
abilities of nsaids to inhibit cox-1 and -2, they also have
shortcomings that limit their application to the preliminary
testing of a drug. for example, assays employing broken cells
cannot account for cell penetration and intracellular drug
distribution. many cell-based assay systems use non-human
cells and fail to account for plasma binding. human bloodbased assays, therefore, have clear advantages. they do,
however, still have drawbacks. in particular, dierent
incubation times for assays of cox-1 and cox-2 activity
reduce the ability of these systems to predict with accuracy the
in vivo ecacy and selectivity of nsaids.
here, therefore, we have investigated the possibility of
establishing an assay to assess ex vivo the activity of nsaids
given in vivo. to achieve this goal we injected rats
intravenously with nsaids and then withdrew blood at
dierent time points. the nsaid activity in the plasma was
determined by its ability to inhibit cox-1 and cox-2 in,
respectively, human washed platelets and il-1b-treated a549
cells. the nsaids used in this study for the in vivo
experiments were chosen to represent the four functionally

f. giuliano & t.d. warner

de®ned classes of nsaids: cox-1 selective (aspirin, salicylate
and  xxxd3259xxx ), cox-1/-2 non-selective (diclofenac), cox-2
preferential inhibitors ( xxxd2727xxx ) and cox-2 selective
compounds (l-745,337). from this assay system we have
obtained good predictive data with regard to the activities of
nsaids and novel cox-2 selective compounds.

methods
in vivo
male wistar rats (220 ± 250 g; tuck, rayleigh, u.k.) were
anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of thiobutabartibal
sodium (inactin; 120 mg kg71, i.p.; rbi, natick, u.s.a.).
body temperature was maintained at 378c by means of a
homeothermic blanket connected to a rectal probe. the
trachea was cannulated to facilitate ventilation. the right
carotid artery was cannulated and connected to a pressure
transducer (type 4-422-0001, transamerica instruments) for
the monitoring of systemic blood pressure displayed on a
graphtec linearcorder. the jugular vein was also cannulated
to allow injection of drugs and infusion of saline. animals were
left for 30 min following surgery to stabilise after which time a
control plasma sample was withdrawn (t=760). one hour
later (t=0) the rats received an i.v. bolus of aspirin
(20 mg kg71; n=4), diclofenac (3 mg kg71; n=4), l-745,337
(30 mg kg71; n=5),  xxxd2727xxx  (15 mg kg71; n=4), sodium
salicylate (20 mg kg71; n=4) or  xxxd3259xxx  (10 mg kg71; n=5).
blood samples of %300 ml were taken from the carotid artery
at t=760, 5, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min. the samples
were centrifuged 12000 g for 2 min at 48c and the plasma
removed supplemented with heparin (15 u ml71, national
veterinary supplies, stoke on trent) and snap frozen in liquid
n2. three hundred ml of warm saline was injected i.v. after
each withdrawal of blood. at the end of the time course,
animals were killed by an overdose of anaesthetic. individual
drugs were administered to rats on at least 4 dierent study
days.

cell culture
a549, a human epithelial carcinoma cell line (ecacc ref.
no. 86012804), expresses cox-2 when exposed to il-1b
(mitchell et al., 1994). production of pge2 by this cell line can
therefore be used as an index of cox-2 activity. a549 cells
were maintained in a humidi®ed atmosphere of 5% co2-95%
air at 378c and grown in dulbecco's modi®ed eagle medium
(dmem; sigma, poole, u.k.) supplemented with 10% foetal
bovine serum (fbs; sigma, poole, u.k.). for the experimental
procedures, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and grown to
con¯uence before use. in order to induce cox-2 expression,
cells were incubated for 24 h in fresh dmem supplemented
with 10% fbs and il-1b 10 ng/ml. before the experimental
procedure, the medium was replaced with fresh dmem: ca2+free modi®ed krebs-ringer solution (see below) (4 : 1, v/v) at
378c.

washed platelets
the production of thromboxane (tx) b2 by platelets was used
as index of cox-1 activity. blood from healthy volunteers,
who had not taken nsaids for at least two weeks, was
collected by venepuncture into gelatine-coated (0.1% porcine
gelatine in h2o, 1 ± 3 h at 378c) plastic tubes containing trisodium citrate 3.15% (1 : 9, v/v). the blood was centrifuged at

2006g for 7 min to produce platelet rich plasma (prp).
prostacyclin (300 ng ml71) was then added to the prp
followed by centrifugation at 10006g for 15 min to sediment
the platelets. the resulting supernatant was removed and
replaced with an equal volume of ca2+-free modi®ed krebsringer solution at 378c (10 mm hepes, 20 mm nahco3,
120 mm nacl, 4 mm kcl, 2 mm na2so4. 0.1% glucose, 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx ). the pellet was gently resuspended and
further prostacyclin (300 ng ml71) added. the platelets were
pelleted again and resuspended in ca2+-free modi®ed krebsringer buer at 378c to match half of the initial plasma
volume. thirty minutes later the platelet suspension was
diluted 1 : 5 in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs and
plated into gelatine-coated 96-well plates (100 ml well71).

evaluation of nsaids activity on cox-1 and cox-2
to assay nsaids activity in plasma collected from the rats,
10 ml of plasma was added to medium bathing either preinduced a549 cells or washed platelets. concentration
response curves to aspirin (n=4) or salicylate (n=4) (0.1 nm
to 1 mm), diclofenac (n=4), l-745,337 (n=5),  xxxd2727xxx 
(n=4),  xxxd3259xxx  (n=4) or  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide (n=5) (0.01 nm to
0.1 mm) were also constructed on the same culture plates on
which the corresponding plasma series were tested. after
incubation for 30 min at 378c, calcium ionophore a23187
(50 mm) was added and the cells or platelets incubated for a
further 15 min at 378c. at the end of the incubation, plates
containing the platelet suspension were centrifuged for 5 min
at 15006g (48c) and the supernatant removed and snap frozen
until analysis by radioimmunoassay. medium from a549
plates was also removed and frozen. each plate of cells and
platelets included two sets of control wells, one incubated with
vehicle (0.1%  xxxd1896xxx ) the other receiving control
plasma withdrawn at t=760. inhibition of cox-1 and cox2 by test compounds or plasma samples was calculated as
percentage of the activity measured in the corresponding
control wells. the eects of vehicle, plasma series and nsaids
on cox activity were measured in at least three separate
determinations (wells) on at least four dierent experimental
days. the same set of plasma samples or drug dilutions were
not used on more than one experimental day.

materials
for the in vivo procedure, all the drugs were dissolved in a 5%
bicarbonate - 2.5% glucose buer in h2o and sonicated until a
clear solution or a very ®ne suspension were obtained. the
required amount of drug was dissolved in 1 ml and injected
over a period of 100 s. for the in vitro experiments, all the
drugs were dissolved in dmso to form stock solutions of 0.1
to 1 m before being further diluted in dmem.
all compounds used were obtained from sigma (poole,
u.k.) unless otherwise stated. l-745,337 was a gift from
merck frosst, canada.  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide was purchased
from aniti (exeter, u.k.). for the radioimmunoassay,
antisera to pge2 and txb2 were obtained from sigma
(poole, u.k.); [3h]-pge2 and [3h]-txb2 were purchased
from amersham (little chalfont, u.k.). il-1b was obtained
from genzyme (kings hill, u.k.).

data analysis
results are expressed as mean+s.e.m. concentration response

two-way analysis of the variance (anova) was used to
evaluate statistical dierences between dose response curves.
ic50 values were compared using the t-test for unpaired
observations. a one-sample t-test was performed to determine
signi®cant dierences from normalized controls. a p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically signi®cant. all analysis
and regressions were performed using graphpad prism
(graphpad software, san diego, ca, u.s.a.).

than cox-2 (ic50 12.34 mm) (table 1, figure 3a). however
plasma taken from aspirin-treated rats was without any
signi®cant eect (p40.05, one sample t-test) on the activities
of either cox-1 or cox-2 as early as 5 min after
administration in vivo (figure 3b). similarly salicylate, the
metabolite of aspirin, was without activity when added directly
to the assay systems in concentrations of up to 1 mm (table 1,
figure 4a), or when plasma from salicylate-treated animals
was tested (figure 4b).

results

 xxxd3259xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide plasma taken from sulindactreated animals inhibited cox-1 to a markedly greater extent
than cox-2 throughout the sampling period (figure 5b). in a
similar fashion, when added directly to the assay systems,
 xxxd3259xxx  and in particular its active metabolite,  xxxd3259xxx 
sulphide, inhibited both isoforms of cox with selectivity
towards cox-1 (table 1, figure 5a and c). importantly, it
should be noted that  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide inhibited cox-1 355
times more potently than the parent drug.

in vivo
the mean arterial blood pressure of the rats at t=770 and
t=360 min was, respectively, 94.3+2.2 mmhg and
75+2 mmhg with no signi®cant dierences between treatment
groups (p40.05, one way anova; n=25). a transient
increase in blood pressure of 15+5 mmhg, lasting 5 ± 20 min,
was recorded after the i.v. injection of each drug. again, no
signi®cant dierence between drugs was noted.

prostanoid production
the stimulated release of pge2 by a549 cells in the presence of
drug vehicle or control plasma was 60.3+3.1 ng ml71 (n=30)
and 62.3+3.9 ng ml71 (n=25), respectively. thromboxane b2
production by washed platelets was 25+2 ng ml71 in the
presence of drug vehicle (n=30) and 21.2+1.3 ng ml71 in the
presence of control plasma (n=25).

l-745,337 the novel cox-2 selective drug l-745,337 clearly
showed the greatest selectivity for cox-2 over cox-1 both in
vitro (1100 fold) (table 1, figure 6a) and in the ex vivo assay
(figure 6b). in this latter assay, l-745,337 (30 mg kg71) was

diclofenac of the compounds tested, diclofenac was the most
potent inhibitor of cox-1 and cox-2, although it was nonselective. plasma taken from diclofenac-treated rats inhibited
both cox-1 and cox-2 with a small but signi®cant selectivity
for cox-2 (p50.05, two-way anova) (table 1, figure 1a).
notably, the inhibitory activity of the plasma from diclofenactreated rats decreased throughout the in vivo experimental
period (figure 1b).
 xxxd2727xxx  in vitro,  xxxd2727xxx  showed a preferential inhibition of cox-2 (ic50 0.071 mm) over cox-1 (ic50 0.392 mm)
(table 1, figure 2a). consistently, in the ex vivo assay,
 xxxd2727xxx  showed a signi®cant selectivity (p50.05, two-way
anova) towards the inhibition of cox-2. plasma samples
from  xxxd2727xxx -treated rats also demonstrated little change in
activity over the 6 h sampling period (table 1, figure 2b).

discussion
here we report a novel approach to assessing the activity of
nsaids against cox-1 and cox-2. our data demonstrate
selectivity and metabolism of both classical nsaids and,
more importantly, for a novel cox-2 selective compound.
nsaids produce their bene®cial eects by inhibiting
cox-2 and their deleterious eects by inhibiting cox-1 (see
vane et al., 1998). thus, predictive in vitro and in vivo assays
of nsaids selectivity for cox-1 vs cox-2 are essential
both to rationalize the use of existing nsaids and to lead to
the production of the next generation of nsaids. the most
widely used test system for the evaluation of nsaids ecacy
and selectivity is currently the whole human blood assay. in
this system, the clotting of whole human blood and the
measurement of the txb2 formed is the basis for measuring
cox-1 activity whereas the formation of pge2 or txb2 in
blood incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide for 5 ± 24 h
is the basis for measuring cox-2 activity (brideau et al.,
1996; patrignani et al., 1994; 1997; young et al., 1996). this
assay has the clear advantage of using easily accessible
human cox-producing cells and of taking into account drug

figure 3 eect of aspirin (a) and plasma samples from aspirintreated rats (b) on cox-1 and cox-2 activity. aspirin added
directly to the assay system inhibited cox-1 more potently than
cox-2 whereas plasma samples from aspirin-treated animals failed

as mean+s.e.m. from three determinations from four separate
experimental days.

binding to plasma proteins. however, the need to induce
cox-2 ex vivo introduces an important variable which in
particular leads to a considerable time discrepancy between
the cox-1 and cox-2 assays. here we have established a
test system that avoids this problem. signi®cantly, it also
allows the analysis of not only cox selectivity but also
nsaids activation and inactivation. drugs were administered intravenously to limit variations caused by dierences
in absorption. however, the assay could be applied following
oral administration of nsaids.
aspirin added directly to the test systems caused inhibition
of cox-1 and cox-2 with ic50 values of, respectively, 1.88
and 12.34 mm. conversely, plasma taken from aspirin-treated
rats had no eect on the activity of either cox isoform. this
observation is in accordance with aspirin being rapidly
hydrolysed in the blood stream to salicylate (higgs et al.,
1987) which is a weak inhibitor of cox. under our assay
conditions, where high levels of free  xxxd208xxx  are
achieved, these concentrations of salicylate were without eect
on cox activity (mitchell et al., 1997).
in contrast to aspirin, plasma from  xxxd3259xxx -treated animals
inhibited both cox-1 and cox-2 with selectivity towards
cox-1. analysis of the control concentration response curves
indicates that  xxxd3259xxx  could only produce such an inhibition
of cox-1 and cox-2 at concentrations greater than 0.1 mm.
this is greater than that achievable following the dose given

and indicates metabolic activation of  xxxd3259xxx , probably to
 xxxd3259xxx  sulphide (kwan & duggan, 1977). indeed, our
control curves indicated  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide to produce
inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 at concentrations that accord
much more closely with the dose given. thus, this test system
eectively allows the testing and characterization of pro-drugs.
moreover, the selectivity towards cox-1 shown by  xxxd3259xxx 
sulphide in vitro was clearly reproducible ex vivo.
to substantiate the hypothesis that our test system would
be suitable for evaluating ex vivo the selectivity of nsaids
administered in vivo, we tested three more drugs. having
already tested cox-1 selective drugs, we chose diclofenac as
representative of cox-1/-2 non-selective nsaids (mitchell,
1993),  xxxd2727xxx  as representative of preferential cox-2
inhibitors (see famaey, 1997), and l-745,337, a cox-2
selective compound (chan et al., 1995).
when tested in vitro, diclofenac produced approximately
equipotent inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2. in the ex vivo
assay, diclofenac produced a slightly preferential inhibition of
cox-2. it is tempting to propose that the mild selectivity of
diclofenac towards the inhibition of cox-2 could account in
part for the low relative risk of upper gastrointestinal toxicity
reported by several authors for this drug (henry et al., 1996;
garcia rodriguez et al., 1998). the ex vivo assay may,
therefore, provide a better indication of gastrointestinal risk.
in the ex vivo assay diclofenac also showed a decrease in the

conversely,  xxxd2727xxx  activity in the plasma samples from
 xxxd2727xxx -treated rats was approximately stable throughout
the in vivo experimental period. however the lack of reliable
intravenous pharmacokinetic studies following intravenous
administration of this drug (bernareggi, 1993) does not allow
any validation of our ®ndings. the selectivity of  xxxd2727xxx  as
an inhibitor of cox-2 was con®rmed both in vitro and ex vivo.

well correlates with the high gastric tolerability observed at low
dosage (100 or 200 mg twice daily) for short treatment periods
(marini & spotti, 1993). however, as the dose and/or
administration period increase, the gastric tolerability of
 xxxd2727xxx  is reduced (warrington et al., 1993; garcia
rodriguez et al., 1998). the safety margins shown by cox-2
preferential inhibitors are lower than those for cox-2 selective
inhibitors. here, in fact, the novel cox-2 selective drug l745,337 when tested in vitro was 1100 fold more active against
cox-2 than cox-1. in the ex vivo assay, l-745,337 was also
con®rmed to be highly selective cox-2 inhibitor, for plasma
from l-745,337 treated rats was without any eect on cox-1.
this observation is consistent with the anti-in¯ammatory and
gastric sparing pro®le of l-745,337 (chan et al., 1995). the ex
vivo assay also showed that l-745,337 activity was very stable
throughout the in vivo experimental period.
the data above suggest that the ex vivo assay system we
have developed has a very promising utility both for pro®ling

the actions of existing nsaids and for the characterization of
new compounds. it can be used to study selectivity and
metabolism under de®ned conditions for cox-1 and cox-2.
it does, however, have two disadvantages. firstly the use of rat
plasma in combination with human cells and platelets
produces a biological heterogeneity that limits the potential
for predictivity in humans. secondly, because of the limited
availability of plasma from drug-treated rats it was possible to
test ex vivo only small volumes (10 ml) of plasma. the resulting
10 fold dilution produces an underestimation of the real drug
activity in the plasma. nevertheless, it is clear that this assay
provides information valuable in predicting the in vivo ecacy
and selectivity of old and new nsaids.
from the studies we have performed, however, it is not
possible to draw conclusions about the relative eects of
nsaids against cox-1 and cox-2 when used, for instance,
as anti-in¯ammatories. in particular, as we were interested in
demonstrating in vivo activation and/or inactivation, nsaids
were administered as i.v. boluses. clinically, of course, these
drugs are generally administered orally. further studies in
which blood samples are taken from animals receiving
nsaids in orally active anti-in¯ammatory and analgesic
doses would of course clarify this issue. more importantly, this
assay could be of much usefulness in the analysis of plasma
samples taken from humans treated with nsaids. the use of
pure plasma ex vivo in association with human cells or platelets
would provide a high quality standard from which to predict
nsaids' in vivo ecacy and selectivity. this test system may
also represent a new approach for the study of nsaid
pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs. generally, in
most of the investigations dealing with pharmacokinetic
interactions the total blood concentration of the drug is
determined. however the clinical value of dierences in plasma
concentrations is questionable (brouwers & de smet, 1994).
the evaluation of the drug activity in plasma rather than its
total blood concentration could represent a much better
clinical index.
in conclusion, we have established a test system that is
capable of assessing ex vivo the activity of nsaids
administered in vivo. in particular, using aspirin and  xxxd3259xxx ,
we have shown that our assay can unveil phenomena of drug
inactivation as well as drug activation. more importantly,
using diclofenac,  xxxd2727xxx  and the novel cox-2 inhibitor l745,337, we have demonstrated the possibility of studying the
dierential inhibition of cox isoforms with improved
accuracy in predicting nsaids selectivity in vivo. therefore,
the application of this system to the analysis of human-derived
samples may help to better understand the correlation between
nsaids dierential inhibition of cox and their reported
gastrointestinal toxicity index. studies on the pharmacokinetics interactions of nsaids with other drugs may also
bene®t from the application of this test system.
