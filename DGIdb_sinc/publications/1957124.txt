of the multiple actions of  xxxd3252xxx , not all are equally relevant. in fact, certain
actions of the drug contribute to healing of acute ulcers or to ulcer prevention, whereas
other actions are more important in accelerating the healing of gastric and duodenal
ulcers. the action of  xxxd3252xxx  can now be defined by the '1 x 1 x 1' mechanism of
action-that is, one action of  xxxd3252xxx  is important for acute prevention, one is
relevant to both acute and chronic protection, and one is important for chronic ulcer
healing. maintenance of mucosal vascular integrity and of blood flow, which ensures
rapid epithelial restitution to repair superficial defects, are the most important acute
actions of  xxxd3252xxx . on the other hand, increased bicarbonate and mucus secretion
seem to be relevant in both acute and chronic protection of the gastroduodenal
mucosa. finally, the enhanced binding by  xxxd3252xxx  of fibroblast growth factor and
 xxxg681xxx  stimulates angiogenesis. granulation tissue, and epithelization for ulcer healing. this 1 x 1 x 1 theory of the mechanism of action of  xxxd3252xxx 
concentrates on the relevant effects of this drug (which has more than a dozen actions)
and may help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action.

 xxxd3252xxx  is the only extensively used clinical
drug, apart from colloidal bismuth subcitrate
(cbs), which gives both acute gastroprotection
and acceleration of chronic ulcer healing without
a substantial decrease in gastric acidity. these
acid-independent, acute and chronic actions of
 xxxd3252xxx  are important in the light of the high
incidence of ulcer recurrence after treatment
with the h2-receptor antagonists. although
these antagonists have revolutionized the field of
ulcer pharmacology by eliminating acute ulcers
and accelerating ulcer healing, they have not
markedly changed the natural history of ulcer
disease. the problem is illustrated by the unusually high recurrence rates, which vary from
40% to 80% depending on clinical trials (l), and
the small but real segment of the population who
are non-responders to h2-receptor antagonists.
furthermore, one should remember that the

stomach is the only organ that is treated by
suppression of its basic physiologic functionsecretion of acid and pepsin ( 2 ) . thus, as with
the disorders of other organs, such as the
heart, kidney, and liver, it is more appropriate to
treat diseases of the stomach and the duodenum
without interfering with their basic physiologic
functions.
although substantial advances have been made
in understanding the mechanism of action of
 xxxd3252xxx , the mode of prevention of acute
mucosal lesions and the acceleration of chronic
ulcer healing remain incompletely understood.
the critical evaluation of the mechanism of action
of  xxxd3252xxx  in the 1990s is complicated by the
fact that previous studies may need new interpretations. for example, the search for a single
mechanism of action of  xxxd3252xxx  (such as receptor antagonism or inhibition of a well-defined

enzyme) needs to be altered to look instead for
a multiplicity of relevant actions (3). the interpretation of the apparent preferential binding
of  xxxd3252xxx  and also of aluminium to gastric
ulcers, as was first demonstrated in rats, has been
confirmed but needs also to be modified (4).
although both  xxxd3252xxx  and aluminium
preferentially cover the ulcer, this can happen to
any compound that is picked up by the debris in a
necrotic tissue. furthermore, the binding does not
provide a uniform coat, as was first imagined, but
rather  xxxd3252xxx  provides a localized and uneven
cover ( 5 ) . o n the other hand, the preferential
binding of  xxxd3252xxx  to the ulcerated area as
opposed to non-ulcerated gastric mucosa has
been shown in patients (6). the benefits of
coating probably needs reconsideration and may
be interpreted as preferential binding by  xxxd3252xxx  of growth factors, such as epidermal growth
factor (egf) and  xxxg787xxx 
( xxxg787xxx ).
acute versus chronic actions of
 xxxd3252xxx 
numerous reviews exist on the pharmacologic
spectrum of  xxxd3252xxx  and its mechanism of
action (7, 8). my previous review was, however,
probably the first to differentiate the single from
multiple, and the acute from chronic actions of
 xxxd3252xxx  (3). although  xxxd3252xxx  exerts at least
10 actions on the gastrointestinal tract, not all of
these are equally relevant to acute gastroprotection and chronic ulcer healing (3). for example,
stimulation of cell proliferation is clearly important only for chronic ulcer healing. while the
protection of the proliferative zone and vascular
integrity are particularly important for acute
gastroprotection (fig. 1). in this review, additional
information, clarifying the actions of  xxxd3252xxx 
and their relevance to acute gastroprotection and
to chronic ulcer healing, are given.
it should be emphasized that acute actions
mostly refer t o prevention of acute gastroduodenal lesions (table i). this usually implies a
single dose as a pretreatment in animal experiments, although a few similar results in clinical
btudies are also available. in human studies, single

or multiple treatments of short duration with
drugs such as  xxxd3252xxx  are also generally labeled
acute or subacute. o n the other hand, the chronic
actions refer to healing of chronic gastric and
duodenal ulcers, with special reference to maintenance therapy after the healing of the ulcer. the
healing of chronic experimental ulcers can usually
be investigated by use of acetic acid-induced
chronic gastric ulcer or cystamine-produced
chronic duodenal ulcers. most of the data available at present are related to the acute actions of
 xxxd3252xxx , and we have very little, if any, evidence
to explain its mode of action in accelerating
healing or its efficacy in preventing relapse after
the initial successful therapy.

endogenous mediators
acute gastroprotection by  xxxd3252xxx  is influenced
by endogenous mediators in the mucosa (table
11). hollander & tarnawski (8) and hollander
et al. (9) initially described that, in rats, administration of  xxxd3252xxx  enhanced prostaglandin
generation in the gastric mucosa. this observation
was reproduced in several animal experiments but
was not uniformly confirmed in human studies
(10). furthermore, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor

indomethacin decreased the acute gastroprotection by  xxxd3252xxx  by only about so%,suggesting
that about 50% of the action of  xxxd3252xxx  is not
accounted for by increases in prostaglandin levels.
because of this interpretation, and because of the

discrepancies between the animal and human
studies, it is probably fair to conclude that increased prostaglandin levels play some role but
probably cannot explain all the acute protective
actions of  xxxd3252xxx .

sulfhydryls (sh) were the second endogenous
mediators implicated, and these have been investigated so far only in animal experiments (11).
these studies showed that subcutaneous administration of the sh alkylator. n  xxxd2684xxx  (nem). abolished the gastroprotection induced by  xxxd3252xxx . this action of endogenous
sh-mediating gastroprotection is probably similar
to the action of nem in counteracting the gastroprotection by prostaglandins, polyamines, and
other gastroprotective agents (12).
growth factors have also been implicated as
mediators of  xxxd3252xxx  action. nexe, sr poulsen
found that  xxxd3252xxx  binds e g f in experimentally
induced gastric and duodenal mucosal lesions
(13). the action of growth factors is probably
more relevant to the chronic action of  xxxd3252xxx 
because they stimulate proliferation of cells. new
studies (see below) strongly suggest that the
enhanced binding of  xxxg787xxx  to  xxxd3252xxx  is particularly important in the healing of chronic ulcers
because of the multiplicity of targets of fgf,
which affects not only fibroblasts and endothelial
cells. but also epithelial cells and smooth-muscle
cells. although egf stimulates mostly epithelial
cells and exerts only a slight effect on other cell
components of granulation tissue, fgf 1s the most
potent endogenous mitogen for endothelial cells,
and for the regeneration of fibroblasts and other
cells, including smooth muscle (14). thus, growth
factors might be the major mediators of the
chronic actions of drugs such as  xxxd3252xxx .
most recent data indicate that  xxxd3252xxx  might
also release endogenous somatostatin (ls), which
is both a gastroprotective agent and an inhibitor of
gastric acid secretion. further studies are needed
to determine the possible contribution of somatostatin release under in vivo conditions to the
gastroprotective and ulcer-healing properties of
 xxxd3252xxx .
 xxxd3252xxx : t h e 1 x 1 x 1 mechanism
of action
despite the multiplicity of actions of  xxxd3252xxx , of
which some might be more relevant for acute than
chronic conditions. the 1 x 1 x 1 theory proposes
that there is one action that probably explains the

acute gastroprotection by  xxxd3252xxx , one action
that is relevant to both acute and chronic protection, and one action of  xxxd3252xxx  that is related
only to chronic ulcer healing (table 111).
acute prevention: vascular integrity and restitution
prevention of early microvascular injury in the
gastric mucosa (16), resulting in maintenance of
blood flow (17), is essential for the energydependent, rapid epithelial restitution from the
mucous neck cell (fig. 1) (18). data available in
1990 suggest that this is a key element in the acute
gastroprotective actions of  xxxd3252xxx  (16-18).
pretreatment with  xxxd3252xxx  or its active components (sulfate or  xxxd3254xxx  (sos))
prevents  xxxd102xxx induced microvascular endothelial injury in the gastric mucosa (as shown by
the deposition of the vascular tracer monastral
blue) (11). this morphologic demonstration of
vascular injury is accompanied by functional
maintenance of microcirculation, as is demonstrated by in vivo microscopy: the passage of
erythrocytes in subepithelial capillaries is uninterrupted after the local administration of the
water-soluble sos component of  xxxd3252xxx , while
in non-pretreated animals the erythrocyte passage
stops, invariably within 1 rnin after application of
ethanol, hci. or naoh (pihan and szabo, unpublished observations).
the migration of surface epithelial cells from
the mucous neck, causing rapid restitution (18), is
an energy-dependent process. it is clear that

other hand, fgf is the most potent endothelial
