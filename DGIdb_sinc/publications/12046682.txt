summary –  xxxd3342xxx  – removed from widespread clinical use by 1962 because of severe teratogenicity – has anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects, including the inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx .
it has returned to practice as an effective oral agent in the management of various disease states
including erythema nodosum leprosum, for which it was fda-approved in 1998, and more recently
certain malignancies, including multiple myeloma. whilst the mechanism of action of  xxxd3342xxx 
remains incompletely understood, considerable insight has been generated by extensive preclinical
studies in multiple myeloma. moreover, clinical trials both as a single agent and in combination have
confirmed benefit in relapsed and refractory disease.  xxxd3342xxx ’s role in treating newly diagnosed
patients is currently under study and it is now established as an important therapeutic option in the
treatment of multiple myeloma. © 2002 éditions scientifiques et médicales elsevier sas
anti-angiogenesis / immunomodulation / myeloma /  xxxd3342xxx 

a tragic sentinel event in the history of drug development occurred with the over-the-counter marketing of  xxxd3342xxx  in europe during the late 1950’s
for the treatment of pregnancy-associated morning
sickness. as early as 1961, reports of teratogenecity
and dysmyelia (stunted limb growth) associated with
 xxxd3342xxx  use prompted its subsequent withdrawal
[45, 46]. the return of  xxxd3342xxx  as a therapy in
certain conditions stems from its broad array of
pharmaco-immunologic effects [31]. this rehabilitation was reflected by its approval in 1998 by the food
and drug administration for the short-term treatment
of cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe
erythema nodosum leprosum (enl), together with
its use as maintenance therapy to prevent and suppress the cutaneous manifestations of enl recurrence [31].  xxxd3342xxx  has since become a treatment of choice for enl and its wide spectrum of
activity has fostered its application in a variety of

disease states. [31, 80, 92] given its teratogenic
effects,  xxxd3342xxx  is now only used under strict
guidelines to ensure that fetal exposure to the drug
does not occur [92].
in the field of medical oncology, the discovery of
 xxxd3342xxx ’s anti-angiogenic properties has coincided with the emerging importance of antiangiogenesis in the role of tumor growth and progression.  xxxd3342xxx  has been shown to inhibit
angiogenesis induced by beta fgf in a rabbit cornea
micropocket assay and vegf in a murine model of
corneal vascularization [15, 42]. in human studies,
the drug appears to undergo activation to metabolites with anti-angiogenic activity [6]. given these
anti-angiogenic properties,  xxxd3342xxx  is currently
undergoing evaluation in the treatment of various
solid tumors, multiple myeloma (mm), and other
hematologic malignancies [20, 25, 27, 47, 49].
results in multiple myeloma are particularly promising, although the precise mechanisms of action of
 xxxd3342xxx  in the treatment of multiple myeloma
are not completely understood and its anti-angiogenic

effects are believed to be only part of the means by
which its anti-myeloma activity occurs. these other
potential actions include modulation of adhesion
molecules; inhibition of tumor necrosis alpha factor
( xxxg2296xxx ); downregulation of lymphocyte surface
molecules; lowering of cd4:cd8 peripheral lymphocyte ratios; and direct effects on myeloma cells
themselves [25, 29, 37, 58, 70, 74] .
in this review, we will present a brief commentary
on its pharmacology; a comprehensive description of
preclinical studies in multiple myeloma to illustrate
the complex putative mechanisms of action of  xxxd3342xxx , and a description of clinical studies in multiple myeloma to reflect its status in the treatment of
the disease.
pharmacology
 xxxd3342xxx  is a derivative of  xxxd2431xxx  and is
pharmacologically classified as an immunomodulatory agent [84]. structurally,  xxxd3342xxx  contains 2
amide rings and a single chiral center (see figure 1),
and its full chemical name is alphan{phthalimido}glutarimide [c 13 o4 n2 h9] with a
gram molecular weight of 258.2 [84].
the currently available formulation is a non-polar
racemic mixture present as the optically active s and

r isomers at physiologic ph, which can effectively
cross cell membranes [55, 84]. the s isomer has been
linked to  xxxd3342xxx ’s teratogenic effects, whereas
the r isomer appears to be primarily responsible for
its sedative properties [42, 55, 66]. the isomers rapidly interconvert at physiologic ph in vivo, and thus
efforts at formulating only the r isomer have failed
to obviate the teratogenic potential of  xxxd3342xxx 
[21, 55].
pharmacokinetic analysis of  xxxd3342xxx  in
humans has been limited by the absence of a suitable
intravenous formulation due to its instability and poor
solubility in water, and the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3342xxx  have therefore been determined only from
animal studies and in humans receiving oral therapy.
the pharmacokinetics appear highly variable [11,
26], and as a result of this variability, the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3342xxx  in humans have not
been well characterized, which has confounded the
definition of a dose-response effect against human
cancer. when oral  xxxd3342xxx  at a dose of 100 mg/
kg has been administered in animal studies, maximum serum concentrations were reached within 4
hours [23]. absorption in these studies was apparently independent of the administered doses and
slower than drug elimination. recent studies in
humans show a similar pattern with  xxxd3342xxx  at
200 mg per dose achieving a mean time to reach peak
concentration (tmax) of approximately 4 hours [11,
26, 61, 81]. animal studies have demonstrated a wide
distribution of  xxxd3342xxx  throughout most tissues
and organs [23]. it is present in semen following oral
administration in a rabbit model but it is not known
whether the drug is present in human semen [48, 84].
human pharmacokinetic studies to date also indicate
that  xxxd3342xxx  has a large apparent volume of distribution (vd) [26, 61, 72]. further, studies in elderly
prostate cancer patients suggest variability in vd
which may be attributable to alterations in absorption and plasma protein binding [26].
 xxxd3342xxx  undergoes rapid and spontaneous
non-enzymatic hydrolytic cleavage at physiologic ph
to generate up to 50 metabolites, of which five are
considered to be primary metabolites [6, 21, 23, 55,
73]. research efforts to better characterize the biologic properties of the specific metabolites have been
complicated by their instability and rapid degradation under physiologic conditions [22]. whilst in
vitro studies suggest  xxxd3342xxx  induces cytochrome

117

 xxxd3342xxx  in multiple myeloma

(cyp) 450 isoenzymes in rat models, recent evaluation of single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic
parameters of oral  xxxd3342xxx  at 200 mg daily in
healthy human volunteers has indicated that  xxxd3342xxx  does not inhibit or induce its own metabolism
over a 21-day period in humans, and thus very little
metabolism of  xxxd3342xxx  is thought to occur via
the hepatic cyp 450 system [72, 83, 91].
 xxxd3342xxx  appears to be rapidly excreted in the
urine as its metabolites, with the non-absorbed portion of the drug excreted unchanged in feces, but
clearance is primarily non-renal, with mean terminal
half lives of the r and s isomers measured in healthy
male human volunteers at 4.6 and 4.8 hours, respectively [11, 23, 81]. in a study report of urinary excretion data for a single dose (200 mg daily), the elimination half life was approximately 8 hours, with
minimal drug excretion over a 24 hour period [11].
both single and multiple dosing of  xxxd3342xxx  in
older prostate cancer patients revealed a significant
longer half life at higher dose (at 1200 mg daily) compared to lower doses (at 200 mg daily) [26]. conversely, no effect of increased age on elimination
half-life was identified in the age range of 55–80
years [26]. thus the effects of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the clearance of  xxxd3342xxx  remain
unclear and additional studies are needed to better
characterize age related or physiologic effects on drug
clearance.
d’amato et al., whilst evaluating  xxxd3342xxx ’s
mechanism of teratogenicity, found that  xxxd3342xxx 
exhibited anti-angiogenic properties [15, 42]. they
postulated that  xxxd3342xxx  acted as an  xxxg482xxx  through the interruption of processes induced by betafgf and/or vegf [15, 42, 43].
further in vitro studies suggested that the antiangiogenic effect of  xxxd3342xxx  was due to specific
metabolites and not the parent compound [35].
another important property of  xxxd3342xxx  is that it
selectively inhibits  xxxg2296xxx  production, while leaving
the patient’s immune system otherwise intact [18],
which has lead to its application in various disorders
characterized by abnormal  xxxg2296xxx  activity. the exact
mechanism of  xxxd3342xxx  induced  xxxg2296xxx  inhibition
is unclear, but it does appear to be different than other
 xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors such as  xxxd2880xxx  and dexamethasone [8, 54]. one mechanism postulated by moreira and colleagues is that  xxxd3342xxx  inhibits  xxxg2296xxx 
synthesis by accelerating degradation of  xxxg2296xxx 

mrna, resulting in a significant but incomplete suppression of  xxxg2296xxx  protein production [54, 71]. of
particular interest is the recent demonstration that  xxxd3342xxx  decreases the binding activity of nf kappa
beta, which in turn controls activation of the  xxxg2296xxx  gene
[85]. it has also been postulated that  xxxd3342xxx ’s
effect on angiogenesis may be through  xxxg2296xxx  inhibition, since  xxxg2296xxx  has pro-angiogenic effects [15].
however, the absence of a demonstrable  xxxg2296xxx  effect
in experimental models of angiogenesis, coupled
with the inability of strong  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors to
directly influence angiogenesis, suggests that  xxxd3342xxx ’s anti-angiogenic activity is not related to
 xxxg2296xxx  inhibition alone [15, 42].
studies evaluating the effects of  xxxd3342xxx  on
lymphocytes have been inconsistent [24, 40, 53].
emerging evidence suggests that  xxxd3342xxx  does
not directly suppress lymphocyte proliferation [29].
however, differential effects on t cell stimulation,
shifts in t cell responses, and inhibition of proliferation of already stimulated lymphocytes have been
shown [33, 34, 40, 50, 74]. modification of surface
adhesion molecule on leukocytes, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, and effects of cytokines other
than  xxxg2296xxx  have been demonstrated, including the
inhibition of il-12 production, enhanced synthesis
of il-2 and inhibition of il-6 [18, 29, 52, 58, 69,
75].
common side effects reported during treatment
with  xxxd3342xxx  are summarized in table 1 [79].
sedation and constipation appear to be the most common adverse effects encountered in cancer patients
[20, 43, 49]. the most serious adverse effect associated with  xxxd3342xxx  is peripheral neuropathy. there
may also be an increased incidence of thromboembolic events, but this appears to be rare when the

drug is used as a single agent. however, recent reports
have shown thrombo-embolic complications to be
more frequent when the drug is combined with steroids and in particular with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, causing early cessation of one study
exploring a combination of  xxxd3342xxx  with  xxxd1937xxx   xxxd1938xxx 
and dexamethasone [59, 90]. possible cardiovascular effects of  xxxd3342xxx  include bradycardia and
hypotension. the risk of adverse cardiovascular
events of  xxxd3342xxx  therapy appears to be greater
when taken by older patients with coronary disease
together with multiple blood pressure-lowering medications [79]. it is well known that  xxxd3342xxx  must
not be used at any time during pregnancy, and recommended contraceptive methods must be used by
both men and women of child bearing potential [92].
the system for  xxxd3342xxx  education and prescribing safety (steps), implemented to ensure the safe
distribution of  xxxd3342xxx , requires a patient’s compliance with contraception guidelines and mandatory
surveillance procedures [92]. in addition, all healthcare providers who plan to prescribe and/or dispense
 xxxd3342xxx  must be registered with the program
[92].
 xxxd3342xxx -induced peripheral neuropathy commonly presents with numbness of the toes and feet,
muscle cramps, weakness, signs of pyramidal tract
involvement, and carpal tunnel syndrome [80, 84].
clinical improvement typically occurs upon prompt
discontinuation of the drug, but long-standing sensory loss has been documented [3, 12, 28, 51]. drugrelated neuropathy is characterized as asymmetric,
painful, peripheral paresthesia with sensory loss [3,
12, 28, 51, 80]. the risk of developing peripheral
neuropathy during  xxxd3342xxx  increases when high
cumulative doses are administered and especially in
the elderly [84]. in myeloma patients,  xxxd3342xxx 
should be used with caution in patients with a prior
history of neuropathy and when used in combination
with other agents known to have neurotoxic effects
[79]. however, whether the incidence of thalidomideinduced peripheral neuropathy is increased in
myeloma patients with a history of vinca alkaloid
use remains presently unknown. safety data from
current phase i and ii clinical trials of  xxxd3342xxx  in
the treatment of solid tumors, multiple myeloma, and
hematologic malignancies suggest peripheral neuropathy occurs in between 10–30% of patients [25,
47, 49, 77].

preclinical studies
of  xxxd3342xxx  and its analogs in
multiple myeloma
although  xxxd3342xxx  was initially used to treat multiple myeloma based upon its anti-angiogenic effects,
the mechanism of its anti-myeloma activity appears
to be more complex. preclinical studies of  xxxd3342xxx  and its potent analogs (also known as immunomodulatory drugs, imids) suggest that these drugs
act against myeloma in several ways. first, there
appears to be a direct effect on the myeloma cell
and/or bone marrow (bm) stromal cell which inhibits tumor growth and survival. second, adhesion of
myeloma cells to bm stromal cells (bmscs) triggers secretion of cytokines which augment myeloma
cell growth and survival [10, 32, 86] and confers drug
resistance [16]; importantly,  xxxd3342xxx  modulates
adhesive interactions [29] and thereby may alter
tumor cell growth, survival, and drug resistance.
third, cytokines secreted into the bm microenvironment by myeloma and/or bm stromal cells, such as
interleukin (il)-6,  xxxg1170xxx , il-10 and tumor necrosis
factor (tnf)alpha may augment myeloma cell growth
and survival [32, 36], and  xxxd3342xxx  may alter their
secretion and bioactivity [14]. fourth,  xxxd3342xxx 
decreases the secretion of vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf), il-6 [30] and basic fibroblast
growth factor ( xxxg787xxx ) by myeloma and/or bm stromal cells. these various mechanisms of action are
summarized in figure 2.
since il-6 is known to promote mm cell growth
and survival, and vegf has been demonstrated to
induce mm cell migration [62],  xxxd3342xxx  may
directly block tumor cell growth and migration, as
well as inhibiting bm angiogenesis [7, 88]. recent
studies in our laboratory have demonstrated the direct
anti-tumor activity of  xxxd3342xxx  and imids on
myeloma cells [37]. imids induce growth inhibition
of myeloma cells in a dose-dependent fashion, with
an ic50 of as low as 0.1–1 µm. importantly, imids
are effective against myeloma cell lines resistant to
conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin,  xxxd2562xxx  or mitoxantrone, as well as dexamethasone. moreover,  xxxd3342xxx  and the imids
enhanced the anti-tumor activity of dexamethasone
(figure 3a); and conversely, these effects were partially inhibited by interleukin-6 (figure 3b), a potent
myeloma growth and anti-apoptotic factor. imids
were also shown to have significant activity against

drug resistant patient myeloma cells. the observed
clinical activity of  xxxd3342xxx  in patients with
myeloma which is refractory to conventional therapies [76], coupled with our in vivo studies, provides
an important clinical correlate with the in vivo effects
demonstrated in our studies and suggests that  xxxd3342xxx  can overcome resistance to conventional
treatments. in addition, our laboratory work further
suggests that dexamethasone can add to the antiproliferative effect of  xxxd3342xxx  and its analogs in
vitro, suggesting potential utility of coupling these
agents in novel therapeutics.
the mechanism of growth inhibition induced by
 xxxd3342xxx  and its analogs is not totally understood.
specifically imids, and to a lesser extent  xxxd3342xxx , induce apoptosis of mm.1s cells, as evidenced
both by increased sub-g1 cells on pi staining and
increased  xxxg166xxx  positive cells. in these cells,
which characteristically have wild-type p53, exposure to these agents (and dexamethasone) downregulates p21, thereby facilitating g1 to s transition and
enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis. moreover, p27
is also upregurated by treatment with both  xxxd3342xxx  and imids (unpublished data). this profound
apoptotic effect may correlate with the clinical observation that complete responses to  xxxd3342xxx  are
occasionally observed. the mechanism of

 xxxd3342xxx /imids-induced apoptosis is not totally
understood. however, our preliminary data indicate
the participation of  xxxg342xxx  activation in
 xxxd3342xxx /imids-induced apoptosis. of note, il-6
overcomes the downregulation of p21 induced by
these agents, consistent with the increase in dna
synthesis triggered by il-6 even in the presence of
these drugs. in contrast, in hs sultan cells and patient

as cells (which are both wild-type and mutant p53),
the imids and  xxxd3342xxx  induce p21 and related
g1 growth arrest (figures 4 and 5), thereby conferring protection from apoptosis, as has been observed
in other systems [39, 63]. in prior studies in our laboratory [87], we have shown that p21 was constitutively expressed in the majority of myeloma cells and
also inhibited proliferation in both a p53-dependent
and -independent fashion.
previous reports that cells overexpressing p21 protein demonstrate chemoresistance [9] further support
the notion of the protective effect of g1 growth arrest
induced by  xxxd3342xxx  and imids in hs sultan and
as patient- derived myeloma cells. conversely, the

frequent regrowth of progressive myeloma noted
clinically upon discontinuation of  xxxd3342xxx  treatment may correlate with release of drug-related g1
growth arrest. we have previously shown that related
adhesion focal  xxxg2198xxx  ( xxxg1890xxx , figure 6)
mediated dexamethasone-induced mm apoptosis.
 xxxd3342xxx  and imids, similar to dexamethasone,
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1890xxx , suggesting the key role of  xxxg1890xxx  in  xxxd3342xxx - and
imids-induced apoptosis. importantly, activation of
 xxxg1890xxx  was also found in dexamethasone-resistant,
imid-sensitive mm.1r cells.
recent studies at our laboratory have also demonstrated [36] that myeloma cell lines and patient
myeloma cells produce  xxxg2296xxx .  xxxg2296xxx  in turn triggers il-6 secretion from bmscs in a dose-dependent
fashion; importantly,  xxxg2296xxx  is a more potent stimulus of il-6 secretion than  xxxg2269xxx  and vegf (figure 7). remarkably,  xxxg2296xxx  also induces  xxxg1559xxx  activation and expression of lfa-1, icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx ,
and  xxxg1482xxx  on myeloma cell lines as well as icam-1
and  xxxg2406xxx  on bmscs (figure 8). as a result,
adherence of myeloma cells to bmscs is signifi

50 ng/ml of il-6 for 10 min, lysed, transferred to pvdf membrane,
and blotted with anti-phospho mapk ab. blots were stripped and

cantly upregulated by  xxxg2296xxx -related induction of
these adhesion molecules. adherence of myeloma
cells to bmscs induces drug resistance of myeloma
cells, induces il-6 secretion in bmscs and activates
 xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk in myeloma cells, thereby promoting
tumor cell growth. since  xxxd3342xxx  and its analogs
are potent inhibitors of  xxxg2296xxx  production, they may
not only be acting directly on myeloma cells, but also
acting indirectly via inhibition of cytokine cross-talk
in the myeloma/bmsc microenvironment (figure 9).
in conclusion,  xxxg2296xxx  induces an increase in proliferation, as well as mapk/erk activation, in mm
cells, and induces il-6 secretion, as well as  xxxg1559xxx 
activation, in bmscs. importantly,  xxxg2296xxx  induces
adhesion molecules on mm cells and bmscs, with
resultant increased mm cell-to-bmsc binding and
il-6 secretion; conversely, blockade of tnfalphainduced  xxxg1559xxx  activation inhibits these sequelae.
these studies confirm a central role for  xxxg2296xxx  in the
growth and survival of mm cells in the bm milieu
and suggest the utility of novel therapeutics targeting  xxxg2296xxx  in mm.

121

keifer et al. recently reported that  xxxd3342xxx 
inhibited  xxxg1559xxx  activation triggered by  xxxg2296xxx  in jurkat t cell line [41]. this inhibitory effect of  xxxd3342xxx  on  xxxg1559xxx  activation was mediated by suppression of  xxxg463xxx  (ikk) activity. phosphorylation
of  xxxg1561xxx , an inhibitory molecule of  xxxg1559xxx , by ikk
is essential for degradation of  xxxg1561xxx . since adherence
of mm cell to bmsc induces il-6 secretion from
bmscs via  xxxg1559xxx  activation [10], and  xxxg2296xxx 
induces adhesion molecules on both mm and bmscs
also via  xxxg1559xxx  activation, targeting  xxxg1559xxx  may be
a novel therapeutic strategy.
finally, a recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that  xxxd3342xxx  and its analogs (imids) augment natural killer (nk) cell cytotoxicity in mm [17].
in this report, we showed that  xxxd3342xxx  and imids
do not induce t-cell proliferation alone, but act as
co-stimulators to trigger proliferation of anti-cd3stimulated t cells from mm patients, accompanied
by an increase in interferon-gamma and il-12 secretion.
importantly, treatment of patient peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with  xxxd3342xxx  or
imids triggered increased lysis of autologous mm
cells. furthermore,  xxxd3342xxx  therapy in mm
patients was aasociated with an increase in
cd3–cd56+ cells in patients responding to
 xxxd3342xxx /imid therapy. in addition, lentzch et al.
[44] demonstrated that  xxxd3342xxx  and imids inhibited microvessel density in mice transplanted with
hs-sultan cells, resulting in longer survival of imidtreated mice than that of non-treated mice. these
findings strongly support the anti-angiogenic effect
of  xxxd3342xxx  and imids in vivo. in summary, these
extensive preclinical studies in multiple myeloma
provide a compelling basis for the development and
testing of  xxxd3342xxx  and the imids in a new treatment paradigm to target both the tumor cell and the
microenvironment, overcome classical drug resistance, and achieve improved outcome in this presently incurable disease.
clinical studies in multiple
myeloma
despite recent advances in treatments, including
transplant, myeloma remains incurable and more
effective therapies are clearly needed [2, 78]. the
development of resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation is a characteristic of myeloma, and this has
spurred research in new biologically derived treat

ment strategies. one such approach involves antiangiogenesis, a strategy based on observations that
hematologic malignancies, such as multiple
myeloma, are associated with intense neovascularization of bone marrow and thus may be
angiogenesis-dependent [60, 89]. however, whilst
angiogenesis appears well established as a key component in the growth, progression and metastatic
spread of solid tumors [19], its role in hematologic
malignancy remains to be defined and only relatively
recently has clinical investigation suggested its
potential in this setting [56, 57, 65, 76, 88, 89].
in 1994, vacca and colleagues reported a high correlation between the extent of bone marrow angiogenesis and the labeling index (li ) of marrow plasma
cells and disease activity in patients with multiple

myeloma [89]. subsequent studies have confirmed
extensive bone marrow vascularization in multiple
myeloma [57, 65, 76, 88], and associated poor prognosis with both elevated levels of angiogenic cytokines, such as  xxxg787xxx  (beta-fgf)
and  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf), and
increased bone marrow levels of mast cells, which
secrete a variety of angiogenic factors [57, 65, 67,
89]. moreover, recent reports have shown increased
bone marrow angiogenesis in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (all) in children [60]. collectively, these
findings have provided the rationale for the use of
anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of multiple
myeloma and other hematologic malignancies.
 xxxd3342xxx  therapy for advanced refractory
myeloma began after an encouraging initial experi

ence in two patients at the university of arkansas
which then prompted a large phase ii study which
assessed the efficacy and toxicity of single-agent  xxxd3342xxx  in relapsed and refractory multiple
myeloma [76]. the primary endpoint of this phase ii
trial was paraprotein response. additional end points
included time to response and disease progression,
event-free survival, overall survival, and improvement in other laboratory parameters. a total of 84
patients were enrolled from december 1997 to june
1998. of the 84 patients, 76 had relapsed after receiving high-dose chemotherapy. oral  xxxd3342xxx  was
administered as a single agent for a median of 80
days (range, 2–46). the starting dose was 200 mg at
night–time and this was escalated by 200 mg every
2 weeks to a maximum of 800 mg. the median age
of the patient population was 58 years (range, 38–77);
the majority (73%) were men, and most patients
(61%) had igg myeloma. chromosome 13 deletion,
an unfavorable prognostic marker, was identified in
42% of patients. analysis of baseline bone marrow
biopsy showed that 21% of patients had > 50%
plasma cell infiltration of their marrow, and 15% had
a plasma cell li >1 %. in the patients who received
high-dose chemotherapy, the median time from
receiving high-dose chemotherapy to study entry was
14 months.

123

the median duration of treatment with  xxxd3342xxx 
was 80 days (range, 2–465). most patients received
 xxxd3342xxx  daily doses of 400 mg (86%), with fewer
attaining 600 mg/day (68%) and 800 mg/day (55%).
response was defined as ≥ 25% reduction in serum
or urine levels of paraprotein and was seen in 27
patients (32%). remarkably, reductions by ≥ 90% in
serum or urine levels of paraprotein were documented
in eight patients (two with complete remission), and
reductions in the paraprotein levels were typically
apparent within 2 months. in 78% of patients with
response, decreases in plasma cell infiltration of bone
marrow and increased hemoglobin values were seen.
however, it was noteworthy that microvascular density in bone marrow was unchanged even in responders.
adverse events were generally mild to moderate
and increased in incidence with higher doses. constipation was frequent but manageable with the use
of laxatives. neuropathy, characterized by paresthesia or numbness, was reported by 12% of patients at
the 200 mg dose level and increased in frequency to
28% in those patients receiving 800 mg daily. other
mild to moderate side effects included weakness,
fatigue and somnolence, which occurred in 34% of
patients at the 200 mg dose level and 43% of those
treated at the 800 mg dose level. more severe adverse
events were infrequent (occurring in ≤ 10% of
patients), and hematologic effects were rare. however, nine patients discontinued  xxxd3342xxx  because
of drug intolerance. one responding patient died suddenly on day 37, most likely due to sepsis, but a possible relationship to  xxxd3342xxx  could not be ruled
out. the incidence of myelosuppression was low,
with significant leukopenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia occurring in less than 5% of patients.
after 12 months of follow-up, kaplan-meier estimates of the mean event-free and overall survival for
all patients were 22% and 58%, respectively. additional patients have been enrolled on study since this
landmark report, and an evaluation of a 169 total
patient population confirmed a 50% or greater reduction in 30% of patients, with near complete or complete remission in 14%. interestingly, response was
more frequent in those patients with low plasma cell
labeling index (pcli) (< 0.5%) and normal cytogenetics. two-year event event-free and overall survival
rates were 20% ± 6% and 48% ± 6% respectively,
and these were superior with normal cytogenetics, a

alexanian and weber from md anderson have
recently reported a phase ii trial of  xxxd3342xxx  in 45
myeloma patients resistant to conventional therapies
[1]. forty-three patients were assessable for response.
partial response or greater, defined by ≥ 50 % reduction of serum myeloma production and/or ≥ 75%
reduction of bence-jones protein, was achieved in
11(26%) patients. side effects were mild and doserelated but reversible after dose reduction or interruption of therapy. consistent with other experiences,
common side effects included constipation (66%),
fatigue (60%), pruritis or rash (35%), unsteadiness
(28%), numbness/tingling/tremor (25%), and dry
mouth (24%). less than 20% of patients experienced
other problems, including peripheral edema and

venous thrombosis in three patients. as in other
reports, the authors concluded that  xxxd3342xxx  was
active in myeloma and should be evaluated further,
either in combination with other drugs or as maintenance therapy.
a smaller study by rajkumar et al. at the mayo
clinic reported on 16 patients (median age: 64) who
received a similar oral regimen of  xxxd3342xxx  with
a dose range of 200 mg/day for 2 weeks, increased
by 200 mg/day every 2 weeks to a maximum of
800 mg/day [64]. the median time from myeloma
diagnosis to initiation of  xxxd3342xxx  therapy was 32
months. twenty-five percent of patients had failed
stem cell transplant and a majority (88%) had
received two or more prior chemotherapy regimens
before institution of  xxxd3342xxx . all patients were
assessable for response. four (25%) achieved partial

 xxxd3342xxx  in multiple myeloma

response to therapy which was defined as ≥ 50 %
reduction in serum and urine protein level with a
response duration of 2 to 10 months. adverse effects
included constipation (25%), excessive sedation
(25%), fatigue (25%) and rash (19%). a few patients
experienced grade 3 sedation and constipation, and
one patient discontinued treatment because of peripheral neuropathy and cardiac arrythmia (grade 3). the
study therefore confirmed activity of  xxxd3342xxx  in
patients with advanced myeloma. future clinical
studies will include correlative analysis of bone marrow angiogenesis, as well as the expression of vegf,
beta fgf and their receptors to further define in vivo
whether the anti-myeloma activity of  xxxd3342xxx  is
associated with its anti-angiogenic effects. various
studies from europe have since confirmed response
rates of between 36 to 51% in both relapsed and
refractory settings with  xxxd3342xxx  at dose ranges
of 200 to 800 mgs per day [38, 82].
based upon the impressive activity of single-agent
 xxxd3342xxx  in refractory and relapsed multiple
myeloma, studies exploring the combination of  xxxd3342xxx  with chemotherapy and dexamethasone
have been started given that  xxxd3342xxx  has nonoverlapping toxicity and a different mechanism of
action. initial clinical experience at arkansas has
shown that the incorporation of  xxxd3342xxx  into the
dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and
 xxxd1709xxx  (dcep) regimen can induce cr in
patients with plasma cell leukemia and multiple
myeloma [5]. moreover, the same group is also piloting the use of  xxxd3342xxx  in newly diagnosed
patients who have received at least one prior cycle
of induction chemotherapy. in an ambitious treatment
program, patients receive induction chemotherapy
with four sequential regimens that include dcep and
cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and dexamethasone
(cad) followed by peripheral blood stem mobilization and an additional course of dcep therapy. eligible patients are then randomized to receive or not
receive  xxxd3342xxx  and subsequently undergo tandem transplant. a further randomization follows, and
patients receive either four courses of dcep every 3
months or a more intense consolidation consisting
of eight courses of dcep and cad for 1 year as
part of so-called ‘total therapy’. patients are maintained on interferon plus dexamethasone, with or
without  xxxd3342xxx . the results of these studies are

125

awaited with great interest, but the complexity of the
treatment strategy involved will make meaningful
interpretation of the role of  xxxd3342xxx  in this setting challenging.
low-dose  xxxd3342xxx  in combination with dexamethasone and also in combination with biaxin has
been reported to be active in relapsed disease in a
number of studies [13], and the results of larger trials exploring such approaches are awaited with interest, especially as there remains controversy regarding the importance of a dose-response effect with
 xxxd3342xxx  [4].
the combination of dexamethasone and  xxxd3342xxx  is under evaluation as therapy for previously
untreated patients. the importance of doing this in
the context of prospective, controlled trials was highlighted by recent reports of life-threatening toxicity
in the form of toxic epidermal necrolysis [84].  xxxd3342xxx  undergoes spontaneous non-enzymatic
cleavage to metabolites, and there is evidence that
the levels of these metabolites are affected by dexamethasone. thus the use of this combination as part
of a closely monitored clinical trial is recommended.
similarly, caution should be exercised when combining  xxxd3342xxx  with other drugs, which can result
in drug-drug interactions, such as sulphonamides and
allopurinol. moreover, a recent report of thrombotic
events occurring in patients treated with a novel combination of dexamethasone,  xxxd3342xxx  and  xxxd1937xxx   xxxd1938xxx 
has further emphasized concerns regarding hypercoagulability, although this seems to be enhanced primarily when the drug is used with other potentially
prothrombotic agents [59].
a particularly exciting new area of research
involves the  xxxd3342xxx  derivatives. two classes of
such derivatives have been reported; the phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors which inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  but
have little effect on t cell activation (so-called selective cytokine inhibitory drugs or selcids), and
another group of non-phosphodiesterase type 4
inhibitors known as immunomodulatory drugs
(imids) which not only inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  but also markedly stimulate t cell proliferation and interferon
gamma production. as described previously, the
imids appear to have significantly greater potency
than  xxxd3342xxx , with a potentially more favorable
toxicity profile. on this basis, phase i studies of
 xxxd2452xxx , also known as  xxxd2984xxx , are now under way

126

p. richardson et al.

in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple
myeloma, and preliminary results are encouraging
[68].
conclusion
it is evident that new approaches are needed to target the biological processes associated with disease
progression in multiple myeloma. current data suggest that  xxxd3342xxx , which has anti-angiogenic as
well as immunomodulatory properties, has major
activity in patients with multiple myeloma. the emergence of orally active  xxxd3342xxx  derivatives with
considerable promise for improved efficacy and less
toxicity also provide an exciting platform for the
future treatment of this otherwise deadly disease.
