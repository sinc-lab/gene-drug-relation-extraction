abstract
rationale  xxxd155xxx  is approved for clinical use in treating
schizophrenia in a number of european countries and also for
treating dysthymia, a mild form of depression, in italy.
 xxxd155xxx  has also been demonstrated to be an antidepressant for patients with major depression in many clinical trials.
in part because of the selective d2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonist
properties of  xxxd155xxx , it has long been widely assumed that
dopaminergic modulation is the proximal event responsible
for mediating its antidepressant and antipsychotic properties.
objectives the purpose of these studies was to determine if
 xxxd155xxx ’s antidepressant actions are mediated by offtarget interactions with other receptors.
materials and methods we performed experiments that: (1)
examined the pharmacological profile of  xxxd155xxx  at a
large number of central nervous system (cns) molecular
targets and, (2) after finding high potency antagonist affinity

for human 5-ht7a serotonin receptors, characterized the
actions of  xxxd155xxx  as an antidepressant in wild-type and
 xxxg1120xxx  receptor knockout mice.
results we discovered that  xxxd155xxx  was a potent competitive antagonist at 5-ht7a receptors and that interactions
with no other molecular target investigated in this paper
could explain its antidepressant actions in vivo. significantly,
and in contrast to their wild-type littermates,  xxxg1120xxx  receptor
knockout mice did not respond to  xxxd155xxx  in two widely
used rodent models of depression, the tail suspension test
and the forced swim test.
conclusions these results indicate that 5-ht7a receptor
antagonism, and not d2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonism, likely
underlies the antidepressant actions of  xxxd155xxx .

introduction
 xxxd155xxx  is a benzamide derivative that was initially
developed as a selective d2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonist for the
treatment of schizophrenia (perrault et al. 1997).  xxxd155xxx 
has been shown to be as or more effective than various
comparators in the treatment of schizophrenia in a large
number of clinical trials (racagni et al. 2004). meta-analyses
have identified clozapine,  xxxd155xxx , risperidone, and
olanzapine as being significantly more effective than firstgeneration (typical) antipsychotics and other secondgeneration (atypical) antipsychotics (davis et al. 2003;
leucht et al. 2009). clinically,  xxxd155xxx  is characterized
by a side effect profile most resembling that of an atypical
antipsychotic due to its low extrapyramidal symptom burden
(leucht et al. 2002). however, like risperidone and firstgeneration antipsychotic drugs,  xxxd155xxx  causes large
elevations in serum prolactin levels, most likely due to its
potent d2/d3 antagonist properties (wetzel et al. 1998).
thus, despite having a pharmacological profile reminiscent
of a typical antipsychotic in that it exhibits high d2 affinity
and low 5-ht2a affinity,  xxxd155xxx  therapeutically resembles atypical antipsychotics.  xxxd155xxx  has also been
reported to improve the cognitive domains of attention,
executive function, and working memory, as well as the
global cognitive index in patients with schizophrenia (deeks
and keating 2008) and declarative memory in another study
(mortimer et al. 2007). however, it has also been shown to
impair recognition memory in normal subjects (gibbs et al.
2008), (mortimer et al. 2007).
interestingly, there is evidence that  xxxd155xxx  has
antidepressant properties in both schizophrenia (kim et al.
2007) and other psychiatric disorders (montgomery 2002).
 xxxd155xxx  is approved for treating dysthymia in italy
(pani and gessa 2002) and has been shown to be a highly
effective antidepressant (montgomery 2002). in fact,
 xxxd155xxx  has been shown to be as effective as imipramine
in patients with dysthymia and major depression, as measured
by the montgomery and asberg depression rating scale
(lecrubier et al. 1997). in another study,  xxxd155xxx  was as
effective as fluoxetine in treating major depression and
dysthymia (smeraldi 1998).  xxxd155xxx  was also similar to
fluoxetine in terms of the percent of subjects with dysthymia
or major depression who responded to treatment, the number
of adverse events, and dropout rates (smeraldi 1998). in fact,
 xxxd155xxx  has been shown to be as effective as comparator
in humans in at least six clinical studies in patients with
dysthymia and/or major depression (racagni et al. 2004).
the presumed selectivity of  xxxd155xxx  for d2 and d3
dopamine receptors has led to the prevailing hypothesis that
modulation of dopaminergic signaling is responsible for its
antidepressant efficacy. indeed, a role for dopamine in
antidepressant action is plausible. multiple antidepressants

psychopharmacology (2009) 205:119–128

from different classes, including fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,
and desipramine, increase extracellular dopamine in the
prefrontal cortex of rats (tanda et al. 1994; jordan et al.
1994; bymaster et al. 2002). on the other hand, sulpride,
another benzamide derivative with selectivity for d2/d3
receptors, significantly reduces the antidepressant efficacy
of desipramine in the forced swim test in rats when
bilaterally injected into the nucleus accumbens, but not
the caudate putamen (cervo and samanin 1987). furthermore, although it has been suggested that sulpride has
antidepressant effects in humans, its efficacy in this regard
was found to be much smaller than that seen with the
comparator,  xxxd156xxx  (drago et al. 2000). overall, with
the exception of  xxxd155xxx , none of the benzamides are
well established as exhibiting antidepressant activity comparable to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and tricyclics.
while the evidence is strong that some antidepressants
can modulate dopaminergic systems, there is little or no
evidence, other than the aforementioned phenomenological
data, that selective dopamine receptor antagonists such as
haloperidol have antidepressant effects as monotherapy absent
action at any other targets. for instance, aripiprazole is
approved for adjunctive treatment of depression, although it
has significant off-target actions at many biogenic amine
receptors and transporters implicated in antidepressant drug
actions (shapiro et al. 2003). olanzapine has also been shown
to be an effective adjunctive agent to antidepressants in some
studies with treatment resistant or bipolar depression (deeks
and keating 2008). additionally, quetiapine's antidepressant
actions are most likely due to potent inhibition of the
 xxxg1505xxx   xxxg2148xxx  by its main metabolite ndesalkyl-quetiapine (jensen et al. 2008) and not to any direct
actions on dopamine receptors. thus, we set out to test the
hypothesis that the antidepressant action of  xxxd155xxx 
results from d2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonism. we screened
 xxxd155xxx  at a large number of cns targets in the hopes
of identifying and then characterizing target(s) responsible
for its antidepressant actions.

materials and methods
radioligand binding assays
radioligands were purchased from perkin-elmer or ge
healthcare. competition binding assays were performed using
transfected or stably expressing cell membrane preparations as
previously described (shapiro et al. 2003; roth et al. 2002)
and are available online (http://pdsp.med.unc.edu). key

 xxxd155xxx  in the above assay media was added  xxxd1891xxx × of
the final concentrations (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm).
five minutes later, 5 mul/well of 5-ht was added  xxxd1891xxx × of
the final concentrations (0, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1,000, and
3,000 nm). the assay was designed to generate a 5-ht
dose–response curve in duplicate in the absence and
presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd155xxx  at
every concentration point. the reaction proceeded for
30 min at 37°c. the camp production was determined
with ge's hithunter camp xs+kit according to the
manufacturer's instruction. briefly, at the end of 30 min
reaction, camp antibody reagent was added, immediately
followed by a mixture of galacton-star, emerald-ii, lysis
buffer and camp xs+ed reagent at a 1:5:19:25 ratio.
after 1-h incubation at room temperature, the camp xs+
ea reagent was added. the plate was incubated for another
hour at room temperature. luminescence signals were then
read using a standard beta counter. data were processed in
microsoft excel and graphpad prism. data were globally
fit in graphpad prism to the modified gaddum/schild

animals

data analysis

ten- to 12-week-old male  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice and their male
 xxxg1120xxx +/+ sibling controls were used. the generation of the
 xxxg1120xxx −/− mouse strain has been described previously
(hedlund et al. 2003). the mice used in this study had
been back-crossed on a c57bl/6j background for at least
16 generations. all behavioral experiments were started at
0900 hours. the mice were housed in a 12-hour light/dark
cycle (lights on at 0600 and off at 1800 hours) and had free
access to water and food pellets. all the experiments were
carried out in accordance with the guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals as adopted and promulgated by
the us national institutes of health and were approved by
the animal care and use committee at the scripps
research institute. every effort was made to reduce the
number of animals used and to minimize potential
suffering.

all values are expressed as means±standard errors of the
mean (sem). possible differences between genotypes and/
or drug treatments were analyzed using two-way analysis of
variance (anova) with genotype as one factor and drug
treatment as the other factor. the anova was followed by
an appropriate bonferroni post-test. all analyses were
performed using the graphpad prism software package.
differences were considered significant at p<0.05.

tail suspension test
the tail suspension test was performed as previously
described (hedlund et al. 2005). briefly, mice were
suspended from a metal rod mounted 50 cm above the
surface by fastening the tail to the rod with adhesive tape.
the duration of the test was 6 min and immobility was

forced swim test
the forced swim test was performed as previously
described (hedlund et al. 2005). briefly, mice were gently
placed in a clear plastic cylinder, diameter of 16 cm, height
25 cm, filled with 10 cm of clear water at 25°c. test
duration was 6 min, and immobility was measured during
the last 4 min. immobility was defined as the absence of
any horizontal or vertical movement in the water but
excluded minor movements required for the mouse to keep
its head above the surface. the water was replaced before
each animal.
drug treatments
for the tail suspension test and forced swim test, single
intraperitoneal injections were given 30 min before the test.
 xxxd155xxx  was obtained from sigma-aldrich. the drug
was dissolved in 50 mm tartaric acid in 0.9% nacl and
administered in the doses indicated in a total volume of
0.2 ml. the vehicle alone was used as control.

results
 xxxd155xxx  has high affinity for human 5-ht7a receptors
in order to identify targets that might explain the antidepressant efficacy of  xxxd155xxx , we undertook a large
screen of potential targets using our receptorome profiling
approach (armbruster and roth 2005; table 1). our screen
confirmed that  xxxd155xxx  was potent and selective at
d2 and d3 dopamine receptors.  xxxd155xxx  bound d2
receptors with a ki of 3±1 nm and d3 receptors with a ki
of 3.5±0.5 nm. however,  xxxd155xxx  also had high
affinity for two previously unidentified targets. these were
the 5-ht2b  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx , which bound  xxxd155xxx

 xxxd155xxx  is a potent human 5-ht7a receptor antagonist
our initial screen identified the h5-ht7a  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx 
as a high-affinity target of  xxxd155xxx . multiple splice
variants of the  xxxg1120xxx  receptor have been shown to exist in
rodent and human (heidmann et al. 1997), and it has been
shown that 5-ht7a is by far the most common isoform in
vivo in rats, though the different variants are indistinguishable in terms of 5-ht affinity and potency (heidmann et al.
1998). since drugs appear to exhibit identical pharmacological characteristics at the different  xxxg1120xxx  splice variants, we
performed all  xxxd155xxx  screening and characterization at
the most highly expressed variant, 5-ht7a. we elaborated on
our findings by performing another set of competition
assays, this time competing  xxxd155xxx  against [3h]5-ct,
which has sub-nanomolar affinity for 5-ht7a receptors
(thomas et al. 1998; to et al. 1995; fig. 2). [3h]5-ct
preferentially labels the high-affinity, agonist state of the
receptor, while [3h]lsd, a weak partial agonist, labels
mostly low-affinity, antagonist sites. we predicted that if
 xxxd155xxx  was a 5-ht7a receptor antagonist, it should have
preferentially lower affinity for [3h]5-ct labeled vs [3h]
lsd sites. indeed,  xxxd155xxx  had a much lower affinity for
[3h]5-ct-labeled 5-ht7a receptors (ki =135.5±15.8 nm),
suggesting that it is an antagonist. in confirmation of this
finding, initial studies indicated that  xxxd155xxx  did not
induce camp accumulation (data not shown). next, we

generated dose–response curves for 5-ht activation of
5-ht7a receptors in the absence or presence of increasing
concentrations of  xxxd155xxx , the putative antagonist. we
then used non-linear least squares regression to globally fit
the dose–response curves to the modified gaddum/schild
equation (motulsky and christopoulos 2004). as can be
seen, increasing concentrations of  xxxd155xxx  shifted the
dose–response curve for 5-ht activation of 5-ht7a receptors
to the right in a parallel fashion, suggesting that  xxxd155xxx 
is a reversible, competitive antagonist (fig. 3). an extra sum
of squares f test determined that the schild slope was not

intrinsic activity that preferentially binds high affinity sites, in contrast
with its higher affinity for [3h]lsd, a very weak partial agonist that
labels primarily low affinity antagonist binding sites, suggests that
 xxxd155xxx  is an antagonist at 5-ht7a receptors

significantly different from a value of 1, which indicates that
 xxxd155xxx  is a 5-ht7a receptor competitive antagonist. the
pa2 (7.94±.08) derived from globally fitting the gaddum/
schild equation thus provides an estimate of the kd (11.4±.8
nm), which is consistent with our earlier ki affinity estimates
at the [3h]lsd labeled receptor sites. thus, we have
established that  xxxd155xxx  is a high-affinity competitive
antagonist at the 5-ht7a receptor.
the  xxxg1120xxx  receptor mediates the antidepressant effects
of  xxxd155xxx  in vivo
our identification of the 5-ht7a receptor as a novel target
for  xxxd155xxx  suggested that  xxxg1120xxx  receptors might be the
target mediating its antidepressant actions in vivo. we
predicted that if  xxxg1120xxx  receptors were the critical mediator
of the antidepressant effects of  xxxd155xxx , then  xxxd155xxx 
should lack antidepressant efficacy in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice. as
previously reported (hedlund et al. 2005) (guscott et al.
2005),  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice showed lower immobility time than
 xxxg1120xxx +/+ mice in the tail suspension test (tst) and the
forced swim test (fst) when given vehicle only.  xxxd155xxx 
displayed a u-shaped dose–response effect in  xxxg1120xxx +/+ mice
(fig. 4) in both the tst and the fst, though the effective
dose of  xxxd155xxx  was different in the two depression
models. in  xxxg1120xxx +/+ mice, the immobility time was
significantly reduced at 1 mg/kg in tst and 0.1 mg/kg in
fst, which is consistent with the expected antidepressant
effect of the drug. on the other hand,  xxxd155xxx  in doses
less than 10 mg/kg in tst and less than 1 mg/kg in fst did
not affect immobility in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice (i.e., exerted no
antidepressant efficacy).  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg of  xxxd155xxx  in tst
and 1 mg/kg in fst, the immobility response was
significantly increased in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice to the level of
 xxxg1120xxx +/+ mice, likely due to extra-pyramidal actions at these
higher doses. similarly, the clear antidepressant effect
disappears at higher doses (3 and 10 mg/kg in tst and 3
and 1 mg/kg in fst) in  xxxg1120xxx +/+ mice. this low-dose
antidepressant effect of  xxxd155xxx  is consistent with the
clinical literature (racagni et al. 2004).

discussion
the main findings of this paper are that  xxxd155xxx  is a
potent 5-ht7a receptor antagonist and that its antidepressant
actions (as assessed by the tst and fst) require functional
 xxxg1120xxx  receptors in vivo. the unique therapeutic profile of
 xxxd155xxx  has proven difficult to explain in light of its
known pharmacological profile. there is some evidence that
 xxxd155xxx  has some selectivity for presynaptic dopamine
autoreceptors, and exhibits limbic versus striatal selectivity,
particularly at low doses, and it has been suggested that this

(upper panel) the tail suspension test and (lower panel) the forced
swim test.  xxxd155xxx  shows a dose-dependent antidepressant
efficacy in both depression models by reducing immobility time in
 xxxg1120xxx +/+ but not  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice. values are mean±sem. n=6 animals

might account for its therapeutic profile (schoemaker et al.
1997). it should be noted, however, that haloperidol has
similar effects at presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, while
another benzamide derivative, sulpride, also exhibits virtually
identical limbic selectivity (schoemaker et al. 1997). sulpride,
which exhibits similar d2/d3 selectivity when compared
to  xxxd155xxx , and the related substituted benzamides
raclopride,  xxxd3096xxx , and metoclopramide, do not bind
to  xxxg1120xxx  receptors (roth et al. 1994). sulpride has a very
small antidepressant effect in humans, despite an apparently
similar pharmacological profile to  xxxd155xxx  (drago et al.
2000). it also appears to have a depressant effect when given
in conjunction with an antidepressant in rat models of
depression, as it leads to a substantial reinstatement of
depression (cervo and samanin 1987). the evidence that
antidepressants modulate dopamine levels in prefrontal
cortex (tanda et al. 1994) further suggests that dopamine
may play some role in mediating their efficacy, though little
to no evidence exists that modulation of dopaminergic

psychopharmacology (2009) 205:119–128

signaling is sufficient or necessary for  xxxd155xxx ’s antidepressant actions.
indeed, the only antidepressant for which any case can
be made for a solely dopaminergic mode of action is
 xxxd155xxx , due to its apparent selectivity for d2/d3
receptors and well-established clinical antidepressant efficacy. given the inconsistency of the literature with respect
to the effect of dopaminergic agents on depression and the
known lack of antidepressant efficacy of other closely
related benzamides, we hypothesized that some other target
might explain the antidepressant actions of  xxxd155xxx . we
thus began by performing a parallel screen at a large panel
of cloned receptors with the aim of identifying a hitherto
unidentified target for  xxxd155xxx . the results of our screen
were consistent with a previous screen (schoemaker et al.
1997) in indicating that  xxxd155xxx  is relatively selective
for d2/d3 receptors. we identified two previously unreported targets, however: 5-ht2b and 5-ht7a. agonists at
the  xxxg1114xxx  have been associated with cardiac
valvulopathy (rothman et al. 2000; roth 2007; berger et
al. 2009), while 5-ht2b antagonists such as  xxxd155xxx 
(huang et al., submitted for publication) appear to be safe.
there is no evidence that 5-ht2b receptors can mediate any
therapeutic actions of  xxxd155xxx . on the other hand, the
 xxxg1120xxx  receptor (shen et al. 1993; lovenberg et al. 1993;
bard et al. 1993) has been consistently implicated in
numerous studies in the etiology of circadian rhythm
regulation, mood, sleep architecture, thermoregulation,
depressive behaviors (hedlund and sutcliffe 2004; berger
et al. 2009), and antipsychotic drug actions (roth et al.
1994), making it a promising candidate target for mediating
the antidepressant effects of  xxxd155xxx .
indeed, we found that  xxxd155xxx  is a potent competitive
5-ht7a receptor antagonist. we thus hypothesized that
antagonism of 5-ht7a receptors was likely to be responsible
for the antidepressant efficacy of  xxxd155xxx . to test this
hypothesis, we used an in vivo approach, predicting that
 xxxd155xxx  would no longer be efficacious in mice in which
the  xxxg1120xxx  receptor has been genetically deleted. as
expected, low-dose  xxxd155xxx  had no antidepressant effect
in the tst and fst in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice, despite its efficacy in
 xxxg1120xxx +/+ littermates. this is unlikely to be due to a “floor
effect” in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice resulting from their lower baseline
immobility time, as it has been shown that citalopram, an
ssri antidepressant, reduces tst immobility time in both
 xxxg1120xxx +/+ and  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice (hedlund et al. 2005). roughly
25% reduction in tst immobility time seen in  xxxg1120xxx +/+
mice after treatment with  xxxd155xxx  is consistent with the
previously reported effect of the  xxxg1120xxx  antagonist sb269970
in tst and not as large as the 50% or greater reduction seen
with the ssri citalopram (hedlund et al. 2005). finally, the
increase in immobility time at higher doses of  xxxd155xxx  is
consistent with the reported immobility-increasing effects of

125

the d 2/d 3 antagonist (−)eticlopride in tst (ferrari
and giuliani 1997), which further suggests that d2/d3
antagonism cannot explain the antidepressant efficacy of
 xxxd155xxx . thus, the clear conclusion is that  xxxg1120xxx 
receptors are critical mediators of the antidepressant actions
of  xxxd155xxx  in vivo in the tst and fst, the best
established animal models of depression.
studies of the effects of drugs that target  xxxg1120xxx  receptors
are highly consistent with our hypothesis. as shown
previously and in this study,  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice exhibit
significantly less immobility time in the tst (hedlund et
al. 2005) and fst (hedlund et al. 2005; guscott et al.
2005), which is consistent with the idea that reducing
 xxxg1120xxx  receptor signaling has antidepressant effects. while
sb269970, a selective  xxxg1120xxx  receptor antagonist, reduced
immobility time in the tst and fst in  xxxg1120xxx +/+ mice, it
had no effect in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice (hedlund et al. 2005). this
antidepressant effect of sb269970 in tst and fst has
been confirmed in at least one other study (wesolowska et
al. 2006). finally, another  xxxg1120xxx  antagonist, sb258719,
has been shown to reduce immobility time in fst (guscott
et al. 2005).
it is worth noting that chronic fluoxetine treatment has
been shown to downregulate  xxxg1120xxx  receptors in the hypothalamus (sleight et al. 1995; mullins et al. 1999), thus
correlating antidepressant efficacy with changes in  xxxg1120xxx 
receptor signaling, further evidence that a reduction in 5ht7 receptor signaling may be beneficial with respect to
treating depression. another important physiological parameter that is affected by antidepressant treatment is sleep.
changes in sleep architecture have long been known to be
associated with depression. depressed subjects exhibit
shorter latency time to the first entry into rapid eye movement (rem) sleep and increased total rem sleep time
(brunello et al. 2000). most antidepressants normalize sleep
architecture problems, increasing rem latency and decreasing total rem sleep time (staner et al. 1999). the
ability of antidepressants to normalize the sleep architecture
abnormalities seen in depressed patients has been positively
associated with clinical response in a number of studies,
though a few studies have been unable to replicate this
finding (ott et al. 2002). not surprisingly, the  xxxg1120xxx 
receptor antagonist sb-656104-a initiates rem sleep
changes consistent with those caused by most ssri and
tricyclic antidepressants, increasing latency to the start of
rem sleep and decreasing total rem sleep time (thomas
et al. 2003). furthermore,  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice spend less time in
rem sleep (hedlund et al. 2005). finally, there is some
evidence that  xxxg1120xxx  receptor antagonism may affect
neuronal morphology (kvachnina et al. 2005) and stimulate
hippocampal neurogenesis alone (nandam et al. 2007;
kodama et al. 2004) or synergistically with another
antidepressant (xu et al. 2006). this is consist with

126

antidepressant activity, since antidepressant efficacy has
been correlated with hippocampal neurogenesis in some
(santarelli et al. 2003; malberg et al. 2000), but not all
(holick et al. 2008), studies. thus,  xxxg1120xxx  receptor
antagonists initiate a number of the same physiological
changes as commonly prescribed ssri and tricyclic
antidepressants.
the prevailing notion that  xxxd155xxx  exerts its wellestablished clinical antidepressant effects by antagonizing
d2/d3 receptors results primarily from two lines of
reasoning. first, an early screen of  xxxd155xxx  showed
that  xxxd155xxx  appeared to be selective for d2/d3
receptors, suggesting that any therapeutic efficacy of the
drug must be mediated by that action. second, a number of
studies have shown that antidepressants affect dopamine
and dopamine receptors, leading to the hypothesis that
changes in the dopaminergic system may be an important
component of antidepressant drug actions (dailly et al.
2004). nonetheless, the idea that the antidepressant effects
of  xxxd155xxx  are mediated via d2/d3 antagonism is
problematic for a number of reasons. first, and perhaps
most prominently, no other d2/d3 antagonist, including
other benzamide derivatives, appears to be a highly
effective antidepressant in either animal models or humans.
second, though the evidence is strong that there are
dopaminergic changes in response to antidepressant treatment, nothing indicates that these phenomena are crucial
for antidepressant actions.
our identification of the 5-ht7a receptor as a target
blocked by  xxxd155xxx  suggests a plausible explanation for
its antidepressant efficacy. changes in  xxxg1120xxx  receptor
function have been shown to result from chronic antidepressant treatment (sleight et al. 1995; mullins et al. 1999).
furthermore,  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice exhibit less immobility time in
the tst and fst when compared to their littermates
(hedlund et al. 2005; guscott et al. 2005) and 5-ht7a
receptor antagonists are effective in animal models of
depression (hedlund et al. 2005) and have the same effects
on sleep architecture as most antidepressants (hedlund et
al. 2005; wesolowska et al. 2006).  xxxg1120xxx  receptor
antagonists and presently approved antidepressants also
appear to have similar effects on hippocampal neurogenesis
(kvachnina et al. 2005). finally, many antidepressant drugs
bind  xxxg1120xxx  receptors with high affinity, suggesting the
possibility that actions at  xxxg1120xxx  receptors may therapeutically complement the antidepressant efficacy of their other
pharmacological activities, thereby enhancing their efficacy
(shen et al. 1993). thus, there are multiple lines of
evidence suggesting that 5-ht7a receptors might be
mediating the antidepressant effects of  xxxd155xxx  in vivo.
our data showing that  xxxd155xxx  has no antidepressant
effect in  xxxg1120xxx −/− mice makes any other conclusion as to
the mechanism of action of the antidepressant efficacy of

psychopharmacology (2009) 205:119–128

 xxxd155xxx  highly problematic. additionally, the finding
that  xxxd155xxx  is a highly effective antidepressant via
antagonism at  xxxg1120xxx  receptors would make its mechanism
of action a unique one relative to other approved antidepressant drugs and supports the development and/or testing
of more selective  xxxg1120xxx  receptor antagonists to treat
depression in humans.
