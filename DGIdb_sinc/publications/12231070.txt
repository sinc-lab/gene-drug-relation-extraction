 xxxg183xxx  as a target in androgenindependent prostate cancer
steven p. balk

abstract
prostate cancer is dependent on androgen stimulation mediated by the  xxxg183xxx  (ar), a member
of the steroid  xxxg1603xxx  family of ligand-dependent nuclear receptors. most patients respond to
standard androgen ablation therapies, but virtually all patients eventually relapse with disease that has been
termed hormone-refractory or androgen-independent disease. efforts to use ar antagonists, such as
 xxxd2143xxx  or  xxxd334xxx , to enhance responses to primary androgen ablation therapy or to treat androgenindependent prostate cancer have been disappointing, which has diminished enthusiasm for more aggressive
or alternative methods to block ar function. however, many lines of evidence indicate that ar function
contributes to tumor cell survival after androgen ablation and to growth of androgen-independent prostate
cancer. this article outlines a number of mechanisms that may contribute to ar activity in androgenindependent prostate cancer, including ar amplification, ar mutation, altered expression of ar coactivator
and corepressor proteins, and activation of other pathways that can enhance ar function. understanding
the mechanisms responsible for ar function in androgen-independent prostate cancer should allow the
more rational development of antagonists that can enhance the efficacy of androgen ablation therapies.

ost prostate cancers are dependent on androgen stimulation mediated by the androgen
receptor (ar), a steroid  xxxg1603xxx  member
of the larger nuclear receptor superfamily.1–3 the
ar amino-terminal, encoded by exon 1, comprises
about half of the protein and can independently
strongly stimulate transcription (figure 1). dna
binding is mediated by a central dna binding domain (exons 2 and 3), which binds to specific dna
sequences (androgen responsive elements) located
in androgen-regulated genes. androgen binding is
mediated by the carboxy-terminal ligand– binding
domain, comprising exons 4 to 8. in the absence of
androgen, the ar associates with a heat shock protein 90 complex, which functions as a chaperone to
maintain the ar in a ligand-binding conformation.
upon androgen binding, the ar undergoes a conformational change that results in formation of a
homodimer, dna binding, and recruitment of

multiple transcription factors that activate the
transcription of androgen-dependent genes.
the standard therapy for metastatic prostate cancer is surgical or medical castration to remove testosterone produced by the testes (androgen ablation monotherapy), but lower levels of androgen
are also produced outside the testes (primarily by
the adrenals) and these can be converted into testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. therefore,
some patients are also treated with a direct ar antagonist ( xxxd2143xxx  or  xxxd334xxx  in the united
states) in an effort to block residual androgens (a
treatment termed combined androgen blockade).
patients treated with combined androgen blockade
have more rapid decreases in  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) levels and may have lower nadir levels
of psa.4 however, the results of most clinical trials
indicate that this combined therapy does not result
in a clinically meaningful improvement in survival
compared with androgen ablation monotherapy.4,5
these findings have led many to question whether
there is a role for more aggressive ar blockade in
the initial treatment of prostate cancer.
prostate cancer that recurs after androgen ablation therapy has been termed hormone-refractory
or androgen-independent prostate cancer. this
term is appropriate because only a small fraction of

figure 1. outline of  xxxg183xxx  (ar) structure and function. the unliganded ar with locations of the
dna-binding domain (dbd) and ligand-binding domain (lbd) is shown bound to the heat shock protein 90 ( xxxg1098xxx )
complex. dihydrotestosterone (dht) binding induces homodimer formation, binding to specific dna sequences
(androgen responsive elements [are]), and recruitment of multiple transcription factors. these include the steroid
receptor coactivator (src) family, cyclic  xxxd81xxx  response element binding protein (creb)
binding protein (cbp),  xxxg1227xxx  ( xxxg1227xxx ), and histone acetyltransferases (hat).

these tumors respond to secondary hormonal therapies, including  xxxd334xxx , and the responses
are generally modest and of short duration.6,7
nonetheless, the ar is expressed by the vast majority of these androgen-independent tumors, it
appears to be transcriptionally active, and it may be
required for tumor cell growth.8,9 therefore, although these tumors are clinically androgen independent, they appear to remain ar dependent
through mechanisms that are not effectively
blocked by androgen deprivation therapy (adt)
or ar antagonists. the evidence supporting a role
for the ar in androgen-independent prostate cancer and mechanisms that may be responsible for its
activity are outlined in this article.
 xxxg183xxx  expression in
androgen-independent prostate
cancer
the ar is expressed in most androgen-independent prostate cancers, probably at increased levels
relative to the primary tumors in most cases.10 –13
our complementary dna microarray expression
studies of metastatic androgen-independent versus
primary prostate cancer suggest up to 70-fold
higher levels of ar message in the androgen-independent tumors (unpublished data sp balk, 2002).
moreover, ar immunostaining reveals a strong
nuclear pattern of expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer, even in patients treated
with a luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone
( xxxg930xxx ) agonist and  xxxd334xxx  (unpublished
data). in contrast, ar expression is not increased
urology 60 (supplement 3a), september 2002

in primary androgen-dependent prostate cancer
relative to normal prostate epithelium.14 –17 these
observations suggest that there is selective pressure to increase ar expression in response to adt.
a mechanism for increased ar expression is
gene amplification, with the ar gene amplified in
approximately 30% of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer treated initially with androgen ablation monotherapy.18,19 significantly,
the patients with androgen-independent prostate
cancer with ar gene amplification had a higher
response rate to secondary treatments with ar antagonists, indicating that this subpopulation, with
perhaps the highest levels of ar expression, remained androgen dependent. 20 the ar expressed
in androgen-independent prostate cancer also appears to be transcriptionally active because these
tumors express high levels of multiple genes that
are normally ar regulated, including psa and
 xxxg806xxx . taken together, these observations indicate that the ar remains active in androgen-independent prostate
cancer through mechanisms that are refractory to
adt and treatment with ar antagonists.
 xxxg183xxx  mutations in
androgen-independent prostate
cancer
a mechanism proposed to account for ar activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer is ar
mutation. studies in vitro have shown that ar deletion mutants, with the entire carboxy-terminal
ligand-binding domain removed, are constitutively

active in the absence of androgens,21,22 yet these
mutations have not been identified in patients.
however, several groups have found ar missense
mutations in patients with androgen-independent
prostate cancer, although the frequency with
which these occur has been uncertain.12,19,23–27
this variable mutation frequency may reflect, in
part, different patient populations, tumor from primary sites versus metastatic sites, or methods used
to detect mutations. in any case, most studies in
patients treated with androgen ablation monotherapy (castration or  xxxg930xxx  agonist) have found a
low frequency of ar mutations.
we have used reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction amplification and dna sequencing
to analyze the ar expressed in bone marrow metastases from patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. in these studies, any
candidate mutations were confirmed by repeat amplification and sequencing, whereas polymorphisms were ruled out by sequencing the ar gene
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.12,26 results from these studies and additional samples are
summarized in table i. sequencing of the ar ligand-binding domain has revealed ar mutations
in 12 of 44 patients. significantly, most mutations
134

were in patients treated with an ar antagonist ( xxxd2143xxx ) in conjunction with androgen ablation
(combined androgen blockade). in this group, mutations were found in 9 of 21 samples, versus 3 of
23 samples from monotherapy-treated patients.
this finding suggests that  xxxd2143xxx  treatment is
selecting for tumor cells with ar mutations.
the mutation found most frequently in the  xxxd2143xxx -treated patients (codon 877 threonine to
alanine) was identical to the mutation identified
initially in the lncap cell line.28 importantly, this
mutant ar is strongly stimulated by 4-hydroxyflutamide (the active metabolite of  xxxd2143xxx ), as
well as by estradiol and progesterone. the functional consequences of the other mutants were
similarly assessed by transfecting each mutant
ar into an ar-negative cell line, in conjunction
with an androgen-regulated luciferase reporter
gene. these experiments demonstrated that 4-hydroxyflutamide also stimulated the val715met,
his874tyr, and thr877ser mutations identified in
the  xxxd2143xxx -treated patients.26,29 in contrast, the
asp890asn and gln902arg mutants from the monotherapy patients were not stimulated by 4-hydroxyflutamide. significantly,  xxxd334xxx  was
still an antagonist of these mutant ars in vitro, and
urology 60 (supplement 3a), september 2002

clinical responses to  xxxd334xxx  were observed
in patients bearing these mutations.7,26
taken together, these results indicate that there
is strong selective pressure to maintain ar activity
after androgen ablation therapy. this conclusion is
also supported by the report of a cortisol-stimulated mutant ar from an androgen-independent
prostate cancer bone marrow metastasis.30 nonetheless, the data do not support ar mutation as the
major mechanism of ar activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer, because mutations have
not been found in most patients (particularly those
treated with monotherapy). moreover, secondary
clinical responses to  xxxd334xxx  have generally
been of short duration, indicating a major population of resistant cells. although it remains possible
that further mutations will be identified at higher
frequency in the ar amino-terminus or in  xxxd334xxx -treated patients, the preliminary data indicate that this is not the case.
 xxxg183xxx  coactivators
and corepressors in androgenindependent prostate cancer
the transcriptional activity of the ar and other
steroid hormone receptors is mediated through a
large and growing number of interacting proteins
that function as coactivators, corepressors, or otherwise modulate transcriptional activity (figure
1).31 the best characterized of these coactivators
are the steroid receptor coactivator (src) proteins
( xxxg1510xxx , src-2, and  xxxg1512xxx ).32–37 these coactivators bind to agonist-liganded nuclear receptors,
with binding to the ar mediated by independent
sites in the ar amino-terminus and the carboxyterminal ligand-binding domain.38 – 42 the src
proteins enhance transcriptional activity through
intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and
binding of additional factors, such as cyclic  xxxd81xxx  response element binding
protein binding protein and p300. however, although the src proteins can clearly augment ar
transcriptional activity in the presence of androgens, their possible role in androgen-independent
prostate cancer has not been clear.
importantly, recent studies have found increased
expression of  xxxg1510xxx  and src-2 (transcriptional intermediary factor-2, murine  xxxg1601xxx  interacting protein-1) in clinical samples from
androgen-independent prostate cancer.43,44 these
results are supported by recent oligonucleotide microarray data indicating increased expression of
transcriptional coactivators, including  xxxg1510xxx , in
metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer
(unpublished data). studies in vitro further indicate that  xxxg1510xxx  can augment ar transcriptional
activity in the presence of therapeutic levels of biurology 60 (supplement 3a), september 2002

calutamide (unpublished data). taken together
with high levels of ar, these findings indicate that
increased coactivator expression could be a mechanism contributing to ar activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer. preliminary studies in
vitro suggest that this activity, mediated by  xxxg1510xxx ,
can be overcome by higher concentrations of conventional ar antagonists. however, the likelihood
that multiple coactivators contribute to ar activity
in androgen-independent prostate cancer suggests
that novel ar antagonists may be necessary to treat
the disease successfully in vivo.
corepressor proteins make important contributions to the biology of multiple nuclear receptors,
such as the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  and retinoid
receptors. the best characterized of these corepressors are nuclear receptor corepressor (ncor)
and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid
(smrt) hormone receptors, which bind to unliganded nuclear receptors and repress transcription
through recruitment of histone deacetylases.45,46
importantly, the activities of tamoxifen and raloxifene in breast cancer reflect their ability to induce
alternative conformations of the  xxxg730xxx 
that favor ncor binding.47– 49 nonetheless, a physiologic role for corepressors in regulating the ar
and other steroid hormone receptors has been uncertain, because unliganded steroid hormone receptors appear to be sequestered away from dna.
however, recent reports indicate that the ar can
be regulated by corepressors,50,51 including
ncor.52 these findings suggest the development
of selective agonists that favor ar-corepressor
binding as an alternative approach to block ar
function.
finally, it should be emphasized that there is a
large and rapidly growing list of additional proteins that appear to interact with and modulate the
ar. although some of these proteins may function
as general coactivators or corepressors of ar transcriptional activity, others may modulate ar activity selectively on subsets of promoters. the ar has
been shown to regulate multiple genes capable of
augmenting or inhibiting growth, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.53– 60 therefore, interactions
between the ar and these modulating proteins
may be another promising target for novel ar antagonists.
 xxxg183xxx  activation
through other signal
transduction systems
alternative mechanisms that have been proposed for ar activity in androgen-independent
prostate cancer are by ar activation through other
signaling pathways. ar activation in the apparent
135

absence of ligand has been reported in response to
several growth factors and activators of  xxxg1836xxx , and synergism has been reported between
androgens and protein kinase c.61– 67 some of these
effects may be mediated by ar phosphorylation,
but the role of phosphorylation in regulating ar
activity remains uncertain.3 interleukin-6 can also
stimulate ligand-independent ar activation,
which may be mediated by erbb2 or stat3.68 –70
however, in cases in which ar antagonists were
examined, ar activation could be inhibited by
 xxxd334xxx  at concentrations well within
those achieved in vivo in patients (approximately
10 ␮mol/l).71 therefore, ar activation through
these pathways is not fully consistent with the clinical behavior of androgen-independent prostate
cancer, which does not generally respond to secondary ar antagonist treatment.
another report has shown ligand-independent
ar activity on the complex psa promoter/enhancer in cells transfected with a constitutively activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase,
and this activity was only partially blocked by
 xxxd334xxx .72 further signal transduction pathways that may modulate the ar are through erks,
akt, ␤-catenin and caveolin, with recent reports
showing that the ar can interact directly with
␤-catenin and caveolin.73–77 finally, there is an
emerging literature demonstrating that ar (and
many other transcription factors) can be regulated
by acetylation, and by conjugation to ubiquitin and
the related protein small ubiquitin-like molecule.
it seems likely that ⬎1 of these proteins/pathways
contribute to ar activity in androgen-dependent
and androgen-independent prostate cancer, but
much more study is clearly needed to assess these
roles and determine how blockade of the respective
pathways may alter ar function.
conclusions
the ar plays a central role in the biology of prostate cancer, and androgen ablation therapy remains, after ⬎50 years, the most effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. although
options for achieving castrate levels of androgens
have evolved over this time, it is an unfortunate
fact that we have not yet been able to improve
significantly on orchiectomy for the hormonal
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. much of
the past effort has gone toward achieving more
complete androgen blockade with ar antagonists,
in conjunction with blocking androgen production. however, although this may lead to improvements in initial responses, it has not translated into
significant improvements in survival. it is generally accepted that the eventual failure of androgen
ablation therapy is caused by the outgrowth of tu136

mors cells present at the initiation of therapy that
are either fully androgen independent or partially
androgen independent, with cells in the latter case
evolving over time into more fully androgen-independent cells. the consistent expression of the ar
and of androgen-regulated genes by androgen-independent prostate cancer, and the selection for
tumor cells with ar gene amplification and activating ar mutations, indicate that continued ar activity is necessary for the outgrowth of these tumor
cells. future challenges are to identify the mechanisms mediating ar activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer and to develop appropriate
antagonists. these might include antagonists of
pathways that enhance ar activity, more potent
pure ar antagonists, ar antisense oligomers, or
novel ar antagonists (peptide or small molecule)
that block ar-dna binding or ar-protein interactions.

discussion following dr. balk’s presentation
oliver sartor, md (new orleans, louisiana): you mentioned
 xxxd334xxx . what about  xxxd2725xxx ? any data?
steven p. balk, md, phd (boston, massachusetts): in
many ways,  xxxd2725xxx  functions very similarly to  xxxd2143xxx .
androgen receptors (ars) that are stimulated by  xxxd2143xxx  are
also stimulated by  xxxd2725xxx . we’ve only looked at  xxxd334xxx . my guess is that it would be the same, however.

myles brown, md (boston, massachusetts): in terms of
looking at tumors that are so-called androgen independent,
have you looked at expression of coactivators yet?
dr. balk: we tried doing it by immunohistology, and it is
very difficult to get those antibodies to work. the microarray data that we have generated have been very informative.
we have arrayed about 10 hormone-refractory prostate canurology 60 (supplement 3a), september 2002
