new approaches in the pharmacological
treatment of obesity

summary many new substances
are currently being investigated for
their usefulness in the pharmacotherapy of obesity. most drugs
interfere with monoamine neurotransmitter (serotonin, noradrenalin,
dopamine and histamine) effects
and act as an appetite suppressant.
other approaches are to primarily
increase thermogenesis (e.g.
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists), or to
decrease fat absorption by inhibiting
the  xxxg1789xxx  (orlistat). new
promising agents are substances that
increase the effect of corticotropin
releasing factor (crf) or urocortin
in the brain (crf-binding protein
ligand inhibitor) and a  xxxg1590xxx  (npy)  xxxg166xxx 
antagonist. the clinical relevance of

introduction
obesity is one of the major health problems in industrialized countries (e.g., (19)). it is often associated with
chronic diseases like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and type ii diabetes, and with increased
risk of coronary heart diseases. obese individuals also exhibit a higher prevalence of gallstone disease and several
major cancers (for example breast and colon) than normal
weight subjects (19, 21, 91, 101). obesity together with
its associated diseases accounts for about 3-7% of all
health costs in the united states (22). the increasing
prevalence of obesity in industrialized countries can be
explained in part by a genetic susceptibility in combination with an abundance of highly palatable, energy dense
food and low levels of physical activity (11, 12, 25, 73).
estimates for the genetic contribution to the variance
in body weight range from 20 to 70% (5, 16, 32, 39).

leptin in the therapy of obesity is
probably limited, but can not be
fully evaluated at the moment. as
obesity has a multifactorial basis,
all these substances have in
common the fact that they can not
cure obesity. they should only be
used as an adjunct to classical
strategies like diet and exercise in
severe obesity. for developing new,
perhaps even more specific
pharmacological agents, further
research is needed to understand
the individually different genetic
and physiological basis of obesity.

about 20 genetic loci have been identified in humans that
correlate with obesity (125), but very rarely are cases of
human obesity the consequence of a single gene defect
(120).
obesity is defined as an excessive accumulation of
body fat. in most countries a body mass index (bmi =
body weight (kg)/ height (m2)) of 25-30 is considered to
be mild obesity, a bmi >30-35 as moderate, and a bmi
>35 as severe obesity (25). yet, not only the degree of
body fat or obesity is important, but also fat distribution
(e.g., (161)). two different types of fat distribution can
be distinguished: a) the abdominal, visceral, android,
upper-body, or male type obesity and b) the gynoid,
lower-body, or female type obesity (25). the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases clearly increases with
visceral obesity (161). data from the framingham study
demonstrate how beneficial weight loss is: it was calculated that each 10% reduction in the body weight of men

would cause a 20% decrease in the incidence of coronary
artery diseases. unfortunately, there is a high level of
failure in the therapeutic treatment of weight problems.
classical treatment strategies like dieting, behavioral
modification, and exercise often fail to achieve long-term
maintenance of weight loss (64). only 5% of the patients
treated with behavioral self-management of obesity
achieved sustained weight loss, and the long-term success
rate of a very low energy diet plus behavior training was
about 10% (56). in recent years, more knowledge has
been gained regarding the mechanism of energy homoeostasis and the complex nature of obesity (6). this should
help to develop new pharmacotherapies to support the
classical obesity management strategies. yet, the use of
an antiobesity drug can only be recommended if several
conditions are met (table 1). this review focuses on new
pharmacological approaches in the treatment of obesity
(table 2). because of the tremendous recent progress in
this field, it is difficult to present a truly comprehensive
overview of all drugs and substances that are now under
investigation.

drugs that interfere with monoamine
neuro-transmitters
serotoninergic drugs
it is well documented that serotonin (5-ht) inhibits food
intake in mammals (133). the precursor of 5-ht is the
amino acid l-tryptophan. the concentration of tryptophan in the brain determines the quantity of 5-ht produced (47). tryptophan is transported from the blood
stream into the brain by a specific carrier (127, 163). a
high carbohydrate intake increases brain 5-ht (48) by
increasing the tryptophan to lnaa (large neutral amino
acid) ratio in the blood, and, hence uptake of it into the
brain (9, 12, 49, 72). originally it was assumed that 5-ht
primarily inhibits carbohydrate intake (93, 163). recently, this idea has been largely abandoned because it

table 1

became clear that 5-ht strongly suppresses fat intake as
well (14). in any case, it is undisputed that 5-ht is an important factor in the control of food intake, and many
drugs that are used to treat obesity interfere with 5-ht
metabolism. the most effective way, however, to alter
energy intake is via agonism or antagonism of 5-ht receptors, not through alterations in serotonin synthesis.
dexfenfluramine/fenfluramine
dexfenfluramine stimulates 5-ht release into synaptic
clefts, inhibits 5-ht reuptake into presynaptic neurons,
and directly stimulates postsynaptic 5-ht receptors (40).
the racemate fenfluramine contains the therapeutically
active dextro-rotatory (+) stereoisomer of fenfluramine
(dexfenfluramine = d-fenfluramine) and levofenfluramine
(l-fenfluramine) (40, 46, 133). dexfenfluramine administration (usually 2 x 15 mg daily) leads to reduced appetite (10) and body weight loss (12). recent studies indicate that the hypophagic effect of dexfenfluramine (or of
its active metabolite dexnorfenfluramine) is mainly
caused by a direct activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1b
and/or 5-ht2c-receptors (formerly termed  xxxg1115xxx  receptor) (29, 36, 42, 60, 143). most animal studies suggest
that the 5-ht-receptor-mediated anorectic action occurs
in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, but
5-ht receptors in the caudal brainstem may also contribute to the dexfenfluramine anorexia (60). 5-ht may also
act peripherally to induce satiety (133). whether dexfenfluramine increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure is not yet clear. while it increased the thermic effect
of food in rodents, it failed to do so in a trial with 30
obese subjects, even though it decreased food intake and
body weight (89). in short-term (3 month) and also in
long-term (12 month) clinical studies dexfenfluramine
was more effective in reducing body weight than placebo
(40). in a one year trial, the dexfenfluramine-treated
group lost on average 9.8 kg, whereas the placebo group
had an average body weight loss of 7.2 kg (62). in normal
weight subjects fenfluramine decreased caloric intake

criteria that an ideal antiobesity drug should fulfill (28, 40, 63, 64)

•

it has to be proven that the drug reduces body weight through a selective decrease in body fat stores with sparing of body
protein

•

it should prevent weight regain once a desirable body weight has been reached

•

it should improve compliance with weight-reduction programs based on classical treatment strategies like diet and exercise

•

any side effects must be tolerable and transient

•

it should not have stimulant properties and an addictive potential

•

it should have a greater effect in obese subjects than in lean subjects and should not cause significant weight loss in lean
subjects

•

it should produce favorable alterations in the disturbed metabolic profile, e.g., lower plasma concentrations of triglycerides, free
 xxxd2154xxx , insulin, and glucose, and therefore improve body weight-dependent diseases

when the volunteers consumed a low-carbohydrate lunch,
but was ineffective in combination with a high carbohydrate lunch (49). this suggests that macronutrients influence the effect of fenfluramine. besides its anorectic effect, dexfenfluramine administration improved glycemic
control, reduced cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as
well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure (9, 63), and
atherogenic risk factors. nevertheless, after discontinuation of dexfenfluramine treatment body weight and cardiovascular risk factors returned to baseline (9). in shortterm studies, dexfenfluramine was better tolerated than
ephedrine/caffeine and fluoxetine (40). the originally
reported side effects of dexfenfluramine such as dry
mouth, diarrhea, tiredness, and drowsiness are dosedependent, mild, and transient, when the usual dose of
15 mg is administered twice a day. more recently, however, it was reported that dexfenfluramine might have a
hazardous potential to produce pulmonary hypertension
and neurotoxicity (9, 57, 75). on september 15 1997, the
u.s. food and drug administration (fda) asked the
manufacturers to voluntarily withdraw fenfluramine and
dexfenfluramine from the market (46). the reason for this
move was a report of 24 cases of heart valve disease in
patients taking a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine (fen-phen) (9, 21, 29, 35, 75). in addition, closer
examination of the echocardiograms of 291 patients who
had received these drugs and did not have symptoms of
heart disease revealed abnormal valve findings, primarily
aortic regurgitation, in 30% of these patients. no such
cases were reported in patients taking phentermine alone
(46). yet, it is not known whether dexfenfluramine itself
or the combination of dexfenfluramine with phentermine
caused this morphological and functional damage to cardiac valves (27).
fluoxetine
fluoxetine is a selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor that
binds only weekly to specific 5-ht receptors (36, 55). it
is a common medication in the treatment of depression
and bulimia nervosa. at a higher dose (common practice
is 60 mg/d) it also reduces food intake and body weight
(13, 90). in a study with rats fluoxetine decreased primarily fat intake and had little effect on carbohydrate intake
(72). placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated a
weight reducing effect of fluoxetine (55, 56, 90, 162)
comparable to that of dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine
(36). however, after a treatment period of about five
months a plateau was reached, and thereafter many patients regained weight despite continuing treatment (13,
55, 56). at the end of a 52-week study with obese patients the weight change between the fluoxetine and placebo groups did not differ (55). thus, there might be differences between various types of serotoninergic drugs
during long-term administration (13). apart from the
weight loss, fluoxetine seems to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity in obese non-insulin-dependent diabetics

(100, 162). reported side effects include asthenia, sweating, somnolence, nausea, tremor, and abnormal dreams
(56, 162). urdaneta et al. (150) showed that fluoxetine reduced amino acid absorption as shown for leucine. consequently, chronical administration of fluoxetine might
have an impact on nutritional status of obese patients
(150). other 5-ht re-uptake inhibitors are sertraline,
femoxetine, and paroxetine (133). so far dexfenfluramine
and fenfluramine were the most important 5-htergic
drugs. since fluoxetine is not as effective as dexfenfluramine, it will presumably not substitute it. however, the
new 5-ht and noradrenalin re-uptake inhibitor sibutramine, which will be discussed in the next section, might
be an effective and more promising drug in the therapy of
obesity.
sibutramine
sibutramine inhibits the re-uptake of 5-ht and noradrenalin (29, 66, 84), but has little effect on dopamine
metabolism (13). sibutramine and its active metabolite
also have no effect on 5-ht or noradrenalin release and
do not react with their receptors (84, 141). sibutramine
was originally developed for the therapy of depression.
whereas it failed to show antidepressant activity, it was
observed that patients taking this preparation lost body
weight (69, 141).
in several long-term studies (12 months), sibutramine
reduced body weight compared to placebo. after 12
months the achieved weight loss was 5-6 kg compared
with 2 kg in the placebo group, and after exclusion of
non-responders the average weight loss was even 8 kg.
the effect of sibutramine on body weight was doserelated with an optimal dose of 10 and 15 mg per day
(91). in one study in rats, sibutramine reduced food intake
more than the 5-ht and noradrenalin re-uptake inhibitors
venlafaxine and duloxetine (84). sibutramine did not only
enhance satiety in rats, but also stimulated thermogenesis
presumably via central activation of efferent sympathetic
activity, which involved activation of  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors (141).
in humans, sibutramine prevented the decline in 24 h
energy expenditure that normally occurs in obese subjects
on a low calorie diet (3). in addition, sibutramine appears
to preferentially reduce visceral fat, as indicated by a significant decrease in the waist-to-hip ratio (153), and it appears to improve obesity-related risk factors like glucose
intolerance, lipid parameters, and hyperuricaemia (154).
since sibutramine is a noradrenalin re-uptake inhibitor, it
elevates systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a mean
of 2 mmhg at a dose of 10-15 mg/d. in a placebo controlled study with mildly hypertensive obese patients,
however, mean diastolic blood pressure fell in the placebo and in the sibutramine treated group. therefore, the
expected reduction of blood pressure by weight loss
seems to exceed the blood pressure increasing effect of a
noradrenalin re-uptake inhibitor (91). in another trial with

m. leonhardt et al.
new approaches in the pharmacological treatment of obesity

obese patients no significant change in blood pressure
was observed, however, heart rate was increased. other
adverse events with sibutramine were dry mouth, constipation, and insomnia (66). as a consequence, blood pressure and heart rate should be carefully observed in patients receiving sibutramine (91). sibutramine has
recently received fda approval for the treatment of obesity (29).

tion (131). dopamine and docosahexaenoic acid are natural brain constituents, and so far no serious side effects
were observed in animal studies. therefore, doprexine
might be a safe and effective anti-obesity compound in
humans (158).
altogether, the dopaminergic drugs bromocriptine and
doprexine may be useful for the therapy of obesity. yet,
clinical studies still have to prove that they are safe and
effective without having an addictive potential.

dopaminergic drugs
adrenergic and noradrenergic drugs
dopamine plays a major role in the regulation of food intake (33). in the nucleus accumbens, dopamine enhances
response output and there it can induce eating. dopamine
release in this brain area is associated with pleasure and
reward. therefore, nutritional stimuli that increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens become preferred stimuli.
however, it is also well known that in the hypothalamus
dopaminergic substances suppress appetite (76), and  xxxg656xxx  antagonists enhance it (33). one of
the most effective appetite suppressants is the dopaminergic and adrenergic agonist amphetamine. the addictive
potential of amphetamine can be explained by its effect
on the dopaminergic reward pathway of the brain (29,
33). therefore, for the treatment of obesity it is necessary
to develop drugs that interfere with dopamine metabolism
without having an addictive potential.
bromocriptine
one of the new dopamine agonists with anorectic activities is the ergot alkaloid bromocriptine (30). results of
different studies indicate that bromocriptine is a sympatholytic  xxxg656xxx  agonist with 5-ht modulating activities (31). in a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial with 17 obese subjects, bromocriptine
combined with a moderate hypocaloric diet reduced body
weight to a greater extent than placebo. this effect is
probably not only the result of appetite suppression, but
also of an inhibition of lipogenesis. bromocriptine also
improved glucose tolerance in obese subjects (30). in
ob/ob mice, bromocriptine administration in combination
with the  xxxg655xxx  agonist skf 38393 was
even more effective in reducing body weight, body fat,
and food consumption, and in improving metabolic abnormalities like hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and
hyperlipidemia (31, 98).
doprexine (n-docosahexaenoyl, 3-hydroxytyramine /
nmi 8739)
doprexine is a conjugate of dopamine and the polyunsaturated fatty acid cis-docosahexaenoic acid. it crosses
the blood-brain barrier much faster than dopamine and is
presumed to act as a d2presynaptic agonist (158). in mice
and rats doprexine suppressed food intake, and in mice it
did not induce tolerance over three weeks of administra-

noradrenalin acts in the paraventricular nucleus (pvn) of
the hypothalamus on two different receptors with opposing functions (76). whereas it inhibits feeding through
alpha1-receptors (76), activation of  xxxg831xxx -receptors enhances
food intake (94). however, it is undisputed that different
catecholaminergic agonists increase sympathetic activity
and reduce appetite (29). the first adrenergic agents, amphetamines and closely related compounds like methamphetamine and  xxxd311xxx , are no longer recommended for the treatment of obesity because of their substantial abuse potential (18, 110, 132). diethylpropion,
 xxxd2546xxx , and phentermine are the adrenergic drugs most
commonly used by physicians in the united states to treat
obesity (5). these three agents have appetite-suppressant
activity and a minimal addiction or abuse potential (132).
adverse effects like insomnia, irritability, and nervousness were reported to be minor and were related to the
central nervous system (56, 132). as mentioned previously, phentermine was used for some time in combination with fenfluramine, which is currently not on the market (26). phenylpropanolamine is another adrenergic drug
with weak appetite suppressant activity and a weak effect
on energy expenditure (13). for further details about the
adrenergic substances mentioned see (18, 29, 56, 59, 110,
132).
ephedrine/caffeine
the sympathomimetic agent ephedrine suppresses food
intake, probably via adrenergic pathways in the hypothalamus (1, 13), and produces a prolonged increase in
resting energy expenditure (117). ephedrine also stimulates noradrenalin secretion from peripheral nerve terminals. caffeine inhibits noradrenalin degradation. aspirin
reduces the activity of prostaglandins that degrade noradrenalin after synaptic release and is sometimes added to
the ephedrine/caffeine preparation. therefore, the main
effect of these three agents is to increase or prolong the
noradrenalin action (5). the combination of ephedrine
and caffeine can induce weight loss through an increase
in energy expenditure and a decrease in food intake (116).
astrup et al. (1) calculated that 75% of weight loss is due
to an anorectic effect and 25% to a thermogenic effect. in
a placebo-controlled study they showed that chronic treat-

6

 steinkopff verlag 1999

ment of obese patients with a diet and the ephedrine/caffeine combination reduced body weight compared to placebo. either substance alone did not enhance the loss of
body weight (1, 5). in addition, ephedrine plus caffeine
prevented the decline in hdl cholesterol associated with
weight loss (2). during the initial phase of treatment, adverse effects, like increased heart rate and blood pressure,
increased serum insulin levels, tremor, insomnia, and dizziness can occur (1, 5). ingerslev et al. (82), however, reported no blood pressure increasing effect of ephedrine/caffeine during short-term treatment in normotensive
and hypertensive obese patients. according to a new
study with rats, ephedrine and caffeine may mutually potentiate one another’s amphetamine-like stimulating effect (166), but other results suggest limited reinforcing
effects of this combination in rats (23).
if the patient tolerates the ephedrine/caffeine combination and heart rate and blood pressure are checked regularly, it appears to be a useful short-term adjunct to a
weight-reducing diet. nevertheless, few data on longterm administration exist and recently the fda has expressed concerns about the safety of ephedrine because
some fatalities have been associated with ephedrinecontaining products (115).
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists
energy expenditure comprises mainly the basal metabolic
rate, the thermic effect of food, and the energy cost of
physical activity (118). it is now generally accepted that
there is a biological variability in daily energy expenditure in humans that is not a result of individual differences in body size, body composition, sex or age. a
lower than normal metabolic rate or a reduced thermic effect of food may be a major risk factor for weight gain in
humans (65, 118, 151). the idea to reduce body weight
by increasing thermogenesis in various tissues like brown
adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is not new. in fact,
many naturally occurring substances such as thyroid hormones, insulin, growth hormone, androgens, 5-ht, and
catecholamines increase thermogenesis. different nutrients like potassium, magnesium, phosphate and zinc have
also been reported to be thermogenic (1).
catecholamines are major candidates for increasing
thermogenesis. unfortunately, they nonselectively stimulate alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and therefore increase heart
rate and blood pressure. catecholamines are also of limited use for obesity treatment because of their short halflife in plasma (86). since it was demonstrated in animal
models that brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and lipolysis in white adipocytes are associated with activation
of an atypical beta-adrenoceptor (= xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor), new
antiobesity drugs were developed with selective  xxxg838xxx -action
(43, 54, 86, 165). the increased thermogenesis can be explained by an augmented transcription of mrna for the
mitochondrial membrane uncoupling proteins (ucp-1-3)
(165). ucps are responsible for the exothermic transport

of protons through the inner mitochondrial membrane,
down their concentration gradient, and uncoupled from
atp synthesis (58, 119). the uncoupling proteins were
originally assumed to be present only in brown adipose
tissue (148). whereas this is true for ucp-1, gong et al.
(58) demonstrated that ucp-2 and in particular the newly
cloned ucp-3 are also expressed by other tissues such as
muscle tissue and white adipose tissue. ucp expression is
partly under the control of  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation.
treating rats with the  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonist (cl 316243)
increased ucp mrna levels in white adipose tissue (58).
in adult humans skeletal muscle is quantitatively the
major site of thermogenesis (28) and of ucp-3 expression. in rats, however, muscle ucp-3 is primarily under
the control of thyroid hormones and is not effected by beta3adrenergic stimulation (58). so far, the effect of beta3adrenergic stimulation on skeletal muscle thermogenesis
in humans has not been critically evaluated.
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists can also modulate metabolism independent of ucps. for example, they stimulate
free fatty acid (ffa) release from visceral fat depots (99),
and enhance lipid (146, 159) and glucose oxidation (65),
which could account for a feeding suppressive effect.
many new drugs with  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonist activity
(brl 26830a, brl 35135, ro 40-2148, ro 16-8714,
cl 316243, and zd 7114) are now in clinical examination (29).
most studies indicate that  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists
can increase resting energy expenditure by 10-20% and
activate postprandial thermogenesis (2). on a 24 h basis,
energy expenditure may be increased by 5-10% (2, 4). in
a double-blind trial (18 weeks) with 40 obese subjects,
weight loss was higher in the group receiving the beta3adrenoceptor agonist brl 26830a than in the placebo
group (15 kg vs 10 kg). both groups were prescribed a
3.35 mj diet. (34).
in addition, administration of some  xxxg838xxx -agonists normalizes plasma insulin and glucose in rodents and diabetic patients (28, 43, 52, 53, 80) independent of the
weight change (38, 165). this might be explained by the
fact that  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists activate the expression
of the glucose-transporter four in adipose tissue and consequently increase glucose uptake in this tissue (38).
in general,  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists cause no variations in heart rate and blood pressure (65). one reported
side-effect is tremor, which is presumably due to nonspecific beta2-receptor stimulation in skeletal muscle (28, 34).
all in all, it is unlikely that  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists
are able to enormously increase energy expenditure in humans, because new data indicate that different to rodents,
humans express  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors in brown, but not in
white adipocytes (83), and adult humans have very little
brown adipose tissue. nevertheless, they might be useful
in obesity therapy in combination with diet and exercise,
because they appear to attenuate the decrease of resting
metabolic rate during dieting.  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors also im-

m. leonhardt et al.
new approaches in the pharmacological treatment of obesity

prove insulin sensitivity (140) and may exert anabolic effects on skeletal muscle (119). more clinical studies with
agonists that are selective for human  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor are
needed, however, to evaluate if the results of rat studies
are relevant for humans.
histaminergic drugs
several studies indicate that histaminergic neurons participate in the regulation of appetite (106, 145). peripheral histamine can not cross the blood-brain barrier.
therefore, the synthesis of histamine from the amino acid
histidine is the principle source of central nervous system
histamine (157). increased histidine transport into the
brain leads to increased rates of histamine synthesis.
three different subtypes of brain histamine receptors (h1,
h2 and h3) are known (106). an elevated concentration
of h1 receptors was associated with a decrease in food
intake (67). this is in line with other findings (92) showing that activation of brain h1 receptors decreases food intake.
the activation of the h3 receptor leads to a reduction
of brain histamine synthesis and release, and, therefore, it
has an opposite effect to the  xxxg1078xxx  activation. consequently, intracerebroventricular infusion of an h3 receptor antagonist increased the brain histamine level and
depressed feeding in rats (106, 126). in rats, the new h3
receptor antagonist gt-2016 crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to cortical histamine h3 receptors. gt2016 increased histamine release by about 75% above
baseline within 1 h (144). in studies with 24-h fasted rats
and also in obese zucker rats, gt-2016 significantly decreased food intake independent of the diet (145). this is,
however, not in line with findings in obese zucker rats, in
which another h3 receptor antagonist (thioperamide)
failed to suppress food intake (126). the authors explained their results with a histamine receptor insensitivity in obese zucker rats. however, they also demonstrated
that the histaminergic system in the brain plays a crucial
role in controlling food intake and energy balance (126).
all in all, the h1 and h3 brain histamine receptors may be
interesting future targets in obesity therapy.

brain peptides
corticotropin releasing factor (crf)
corticotropin releasing factor (crf) is a neuropeptide
that has long been known to reduce food intake when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (88, 97). the crf-related peptide urocortin (156) is
even more effective as an appetite suppressant than crf
itself (41). a reduced hypothalamic crf level due to a
dysregulation of the pituitary-adrenal axis may be associated with the development of obesity (41). however, crf
receptor agonists can not be used in the obesity treatment,
because they trigger stress symptoms (71). the binding of

7

crf to its specific carrier protein (crf binding protein,
crf-bp) in metabolic regulatory brain regions attenuates
its ability to reduce food intake (41, 70). a new substance
(crf-bp ligand inhibitor), which dissociates crf or urocortin from crf-bp and increases endogenous brain
levels of unbound crf or urocortin, significantly attenuated weight gain after intracerebroventricular administration in obese zucker rats (70). in contrast to crf receptor
agonists, it had no stimulating effect on  xxxg1801xxx  secretion, heart rate or blood pressure
(70, 71). since crf is considered to be one of the major
central satiety substances, crf-bp ligand inhibitors are
potentially useful drugs in obesity treatment, although
further studies are needed to establish their effectiveness
and safety.
 xxxg1590xxx 
 xxxg1590xxx  (npy) is another important neuropeptide
that stimulates food intake when injected into the hypothalamus (17, 93, 95) and other brain areas. npy belongs
to a group of neuropeptides that also includes  xxxd1348xxx 
(pyy) and  xxxg1823xxx  (pp) (87, 137). it is
synthesized by neurons of the arcuate nucleus and secreted from their terminals in the paraventricular nucleus
and ventromedial hypothalamus (45, 96). npy stimulates
in particular carbohydrate intake (96). besides inducing
hyperphagia and hyperinsulinemia, npy enhances liver
and adipose tissue lipogenetic activity and increases basal
corticosteronemia in rats. interestingly, the same effects
were observed when npy-induced hyperphagia was prevented by pair-feeding (168). npy receptors are found
both in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. to date, six npy receptor subtypes have been
characterized (114) and four have been successfully
cloned from rodent and human tissue (7, 138, 160). some
data (74, 87, 114) suggest that npy stimulates eating
through the y1 receptor. yet, recent evidence indicates
that the  xxxg166xxx  is the primary “feeding receptor” (51,
77, 128). this is in line with the selective downregulation of y5 and not y1 receptors observed in obese
zucker rats (160). another trial with mice lacking the
npy  xxxg166xxx  also demonstrated that the npy y5
receptor does mediate some of the effects of centrally
administered npy (102). however, the npy  xxxg166xxx 
was not required for appropriate feeding under normal
conditions or following food deprivation (102).
in addition, it is clear that neither a polymorphism in
npy y1 nor in npy  xxxg166xxx  genes is responsible for
the variability of body weight in humans (123). findings
that npy knockout mice eat and gain weight normally
suggest that npy is not an obligatory part of the neuroendocrine network for the control of food intake and body
weight (44). in addition, hollopeter et al. (79) showed
that npy is not required for the development of obesity
in diet-, chemical- and genetic-induced obesity of mice.
nevertheless, in the absence of npy, ob/ob mice were

8

european journal of nutrition, vol. 38, number 1 (1999)
 steinkopff verlag 1999

less obese and were less severely affected by diabetes and
sterility (45). therefore, npy might contribute to forms
of obesity associated with impaired leptin signaling (45).
once the physiological role of the different npy receptors is fully understood, it should be possible to develop selective npy receptor antagonists as antiobesity
drugs. however, presumably neither a npy y1 nor a
npy  xxxg166xxx  antagonist will be a panacea in obesity
therapy.

ob-gene product leptin
the discovery of the ob gene product leptin in 1994 by
friedman and colleagues (167) resulted in enormous publicity, because leptin is considered to be the long sought
lipostatic feedback signal in the control of body weight.
in addition, the fact that administration of leptin to female
mice triggered the onset of puberty and sexual maturity
indicates that leptin controls reproductive functions (6,
26, 130).
leptin is synthesized and secreted by white adipose
tissue in proportion to the adipose mass (24, 50, 81) and,
as shown recently, by the placenta of pregnant women
(103). in rodents, the ob gene is also expressed in brown
adipose tissue (125). glucocorticoids and insulin are
presumably involved in ob gene expression (125). also,
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor stimulation seems to reduce leptin expression (139), whereas cytokines such as tumor necrosis
factor-alpha and interleukin-1 stimulate leptin synthesis (15).
the cns action of leptin on food intake and energy
expenditure is mediated by different neuropetides. for example, leptin inhibited npy gene expression in various
brain regions including the arcuate nucleus (20, 25, 45,
109, 120, 136, 137) and increased crf gene expression
in the paraventricular nucleus (25, 147, 149). recent
studies identified further potential targets of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. central administration of leptin
was associated with a decrease in hypothalamic galanin,
melanin-concentrating hormone and  xxxg1801xxx ,
and with an increase in  xxxg1618xxx  gene expression
(124). mizuno et al. (107), however, showed a stimulating effect of leptin on hypothalamic  xxxg1801xxx 
neurons.
although the exact mechanism of leptin action is not
fully understood, it is clear that leptin reduces food intake
and increases energy expenditure after peripheral and
central administration in obese and lean laboratory animals (8, 25, 50, 54).
most obese people, however, have high leptin plasma
levels, and body fat content and plasma leptin concentration are highly correlated (50). this indicates that obesity
in humans is not caused by a leptin deficiency (6). yet, a
higher proportion of total leptin circulates in the bound
form in lean than in obese subjects (134). in addition, unlike marked changes in serum leptin, leptin concentration
in the cerebrospinal fluid in obese humans is only mod-

estly increased (134). this might be due to the fact that
leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier through a saturable
process (15, 134, 139). it is also interesting that independent from total body fat, leptin levels are higher in
women than in men (15, 134). presumably testosterone
secretion suppresses serum leptin levels in men (113).
at the moment, the clinical relevance of leptin in
obesity therapy can not be conclusively evaluated. although obesity in humans is very rarely caused by leptin
deficiency (6), a decreased sensitivity to leptin may contribute to the problem in some people (8, 25, 26, 50, 109,
129, 155). sinha and caro (134) assume that about 5% of
the obese population are relatively leptin resistant and
that they could benefit from leptin therapy. still, so far no
significant abnormality of the hypothalamic  xxxg1320xxx  has been demonstrated in humans (15, 24, 134).
short-term fasting or overfeeding (= negative or positive energy balance, respectively) triggers overproportional changes in plasma leptin level (37, 134). therefore,
leptin may function as a sensor of energy balance (134),
and leptin administration during active weight loss might
attenuate the compensatory neuroendocrine responses that
may result in increased appetite in some patients with
obesity. leptin might therefore help them to reduce food
consumption and to maintain their reduced weight after
dieting (15, 130, 139).

 xxxg1789xxx  inhibitor
one new gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor is orlistat (tetrahydro- xxxd2792xxx /thl), a derivative of the naturally occurring lipase inhibitor  xxxd2792xxx  (68). orlistat reacts with
gastric, pancreatic, and pancreatic carboxylester lipases
(29) to form a relatively stable orlistat-enzyme adduct.
consequently, triglyceride hydrolysis and the subsequent
absorption of free  xxxd2154xxx  and monoglycerides is reduced (61), and fecal fat excretion is increased (68).
orlistat reacts specifically with lipase and has no effect
on the activity of other hydrolases like amylase, trypsin,
and pancreatic  xxxg1759xxx  (61). however, the inhibition of the pancreatic carboxyester lipase leads to a reduced hydrolysis and absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins
(29).
in human volunteers, administration of 120 mg orlistat
three times a day (tid) caused an excretion of about 30%
of ingested fat and a caloric deficit of about 200 calories
per day (61). in different parallel-group, placebocontrolled studies with treatment periods in the range of 6
to 24 months, patients receiving orlistat lost more body
weight (85, 135, 152) and were more successful in maintaining the weight loss than control subjects, which only
received a calorie-restricted diet (85, 135). moreover,
orlistat decreased plasma total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol to a greater extent than expected from weight loss
alone (135). orlistat-treated patients with type 2 diabetes
achieved greater weight loss, improved glycemic control,

m. leonhardt et al.
new approaches in the pharmacological treatment of obesity

and the dose of oral hypoglycemic medication could be
decrease more than in the placebo group (78)
nevertheless, patients reported side-effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, looseness of stools or
occasional anal leakage (29, 85). generally, the tolerability of orlistat was related to the amount of fat in the diet.
with a diet containing high amounts of fat, less of the lipase inhibitor was tolerated compared with a low fat diet
(68). furthermore, orlistat decreased mean plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins, d and e, and
beta-carotene, although vitamin levels of most patients remained within the clinical reference range (85, 135, 152).
most of the administered drug (83%) is excreted as an
intact molecule with the feces, and only a small percentage is absorbed (1.5-4%) (61). this is confirmed by sjöström et al. (135) showing that even after a 24 months
treatment period with orlistat, plasma concentrations of
orlistat were measurable, but very low, with no evidence of
accumulation. therefore, the potential for a hazardous effect on postabsorptive metabolism should be low (61). the
finding that breast neoplasms were diagnosed in 11 female
patients receiving orlistat (120 mg tid, compared with 3
cases in the placebo group, however, caused doubt concerning the safety of orlistat (29, 104). after evaluating the
size of the tumors and length of time that the female patients were on orlistat, it was concluded that 8 of the 11 tumors were present prior the beginning of the medication
and consequently could not be caused by the therapy.
thus, there was no difference in the incidence of breast
cancer between the orlistat and the placebo group (104,
108). in may 1998, the fda issued a letter of approvability for orlistat and if certain conditions such as submission
of follow-up safety data are fulfilled, orlistat will achieve
final approval (121). recently, orlistat has also received
approval from the european commission (122).
overall, orlistat in conjunction with a mildly energyrestricted diet causes an additional caloric deficit due to a
reduction in fat absorption and is, therefore, a useful adjunct for obesity therapy. without dieting, the prescription of orlistat makes no sense, because patients are likely
to eat more food to compensate for the caloric deficit.
plasma concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins, however,
should be controlled regularly, and if necessary, the vitamins should be supplemented.
it is of course also possible to use fat substitutes in an
attempt to reduce fat absorption. one of the most important fat substitutes is olestra, a mixture of hexa-, hepta-,
and octa-esters of sucrose with long-chain  xxxd2154xxx . for
further details about fat substitutes see cerulli et al. (29)
and menden (105).

other potential targets for the treatment of obesity
the  xxxg1801xxx  ( xxxg1801xxx ), a product of the  xxxg1801xxx  gene, inhibits eating by
acting through the melanocortin-4 (mc4) receptor (107,

9

142). therefore, a mc4 receptor agonist might be a useful antiobesity agent (142).
as mentioned previously, ucp-2 and 3 are expressed
by white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (142), and, as
shown recently, ucp-2 mrna is decreased in skeletal
muscle (111) and in intraperitoneal adipose tissue of
obese humans (112). therefore, activators of these proteins other than  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonists might also be
interesting for obesity therapy (26).
further potential neuropeptide targets for appetite suppressants include receptors for melanocyte concentrating
hormone (mch), galanin, and opiod peptides (26). of the
gastrointestinal peptides implicated in the control of food
intake, glp-1 might be the most interesting for the development of antiobesity agents.

final remarks
in most adults, body weight and body fat remain relatively constant over many years despite large variations
of energy intake and expenditure. a very complex set of
peripheral (hormones, metabolites, fuel oxidation) and
central (neuropeptides and neurotransmitters) signals controls food intake. therefore, it is unlikely that one signal
substance can overwhelm all the other control mechanisms. a panacea for weight loss might never be found
and probably does not exist (164). consequently, most
antiobesity drugs so far cause only a modest weight loss
and tend to lose their effectiveness with long-term administration. in addition, after discontinuation of antiobesity
drugs, body weight generally returns to pre-treatment
level. therefore, chronic treatment is required to help patients to maintain their reduced body weight (57).
in this context, it is important to consider that every
antiobesity drug has side-effects and, as demonstrated for
dexfenfluramine, these undesirable effects are not always
immediately obvious and might put people at risk (75).
therefore, the prescription of antiobesity drugs should be
restricted to people who have an augmented health risk as
a result of their excessively high body weight. in addition, drugs should only be used as an adjunct to diet and
exercise to help patients to maintain their voluntary
change in eating behavior (101).
given the complex interactions and redundancies in
the physiological control of energy balance, a parallel intervention in multiple regulatory pathways may be the
most promising approach to avoid compensation as a consequence of the manipulation of one single pathway in
control of body weight (109). while such an approach reduces the likelihood of compensation, it may increase the
risk of side-effects (75). finally, further research is
needed to understand the genetic (16, 20) and physiological basis of obesity. in the future that knowledge might
help to develop even more specific pharmacological
agents that can more efficiently control body weight with
fewer hazards.
