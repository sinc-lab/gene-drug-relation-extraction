introduction:  xxxd2529xxx  is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (era)
showing sustained receptor occupancy. in vitro and in vivo animal studies
have demonstrated its potency in antagonizing endothelin-induced disorders. a large morbidity/mortality study in patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension (pah) taking  xxxd2529xxx  has been completed recently.
areas covered: this drug evaluation reviews the efficacy, safety and clinical
pharmacology of  xxxd2529xxx  in the treatment of pah.
expert opinion: the large phase iii study (seraphin) tested  xxxd2529xxx  in
more than 700 pah patients and has provided unique long-term outcome
data for this era, not available for other members of this class. the effect
on a composite clinically relevant morbidity/mortality end point was highly
significant at a 10 mg/day dose. the safety profile of  xxxd2529xxx  appears to
be superior with respect to hepatic safety and edema/fluid retention than
 xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx , respectively, and is similar when considering
decrease in hemoglobin concentration. the drug has a low propensity for
drug--drug interactions and has one circulating pharmacologically active
metabolite. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2529xxx  in patients with renal or
hepatic impairment does not require dose adjustments. based on its characteristics,  xxxd2529xxx  is an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in the long-term treatment of pah. its potential use in other disorders is
under investigation.

introduction

pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a progressive and severe cardiopulmonary
disease characterized by sustained elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, which
ultimately leads to right heart failure (rhf) and death [1]. pah refers to a group of
diseases characterized by a vasculopathy that involves small pulmonary arteries without significant parenchymal disease. the other four classes of pulmonary hypertension (ph) as classified by the dana point classification system [2] are ph due to left
heart disease, ph due to chronic lung diseases or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic
ph and ph with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms.

drug classes which have demonstrated beneficial effects in
the treatment of pah are the endothelin receptor antagonists
(eras)  xxxd358xxx  [3,4] and  xxxd138xxx  [5,6], the
phosphodiesterase-5 (pde-5) inhibitors sildenafil [7] and tadalafil [8,9], prostacyclin (epoprostenol) [10,11], and the prostanoids
 xxxd3415xxx  [12],  xxxd2331xxx  [13] and  xxxd319xxx  [14]. another era,
 xxxd3207xxx , also had shown beneficial effects [15] but was withdrawn from the market after cases of potentially drug-induced
fatal hepatotoxicity had been reported [16]. current guidelines
of the european society of cardiology [17] and the american
college of cardiology/american heart association [18] provide
recommendations for the choice of drug treatment based on
the severity of the disease (who functional class [fc]).
with the drugs mentioned, improvements in pulmonary
hemodynamics, exercise capacity (6-min walk distance,
6mwd), functional status and time to clinical worsening
were shown in short-term clinical trials over 3 to 6 months.
although a patient’s baseline 6mwd correlates with cardiac
function, quality of life and fc [19-22], the value of its change
from baseline in predicting survival is being debated [23-27].
savarese et al. [28] recently performed a meta-regression
analysis on 22 randomized clinical trials in more than
3000 pah patients and concluded that change in 6mwd
after 3 -- 6 months of therapy is not significantly associated
with outcome (all-cause death, hospitalization/transplantation, initiation of rescue therapy and composite clinical end
point). other limitations associated with change in 6mwd
as primary end point in pah trials are that improvement
may not be possible in patients who are on effective background therapies or in those with less advanced disease (ceiling effect) [29,30]. therefore, it is now recommended that a
composite clinical outcome end point that includes mortality
is used as primary end point in pivotal pah trials [2,31-33].
the design of the phase iii trial performed with  xxxd2529xxx 
(box 1) incorporated all these considerations in line with the
dana point guidelines [2] and was the first attempt to assess
the long-term outcome benefit of a pah therapy in a controlled clinical trial setting.

this paper provides an overview on efficacy, safety and
clinical pharmacology aspects of the new era  xxxd2529xxx 
and compares them with characteristics of the marketed
eras  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx .

compound and mechanism of action

 xxxd2529xxx  ( xxxd2529xxx ) is an orally active and potent dual
(eta and etb) era belonging to a new chemical class [34].
it is the result of an extensive discovery program with the
goal to maximize blockade of endothelin receptors in diseased
tissue, and to minimize the risk of liver enzyme changes
observed with other eras. chemically,  xxxd2529xxx  is

et-1 plasma concentrations, a marker of  xxxg677xxx  blockade, at doses which are pharmacologically active on blood pressure in rat models of systemic hypertension and ph. in most
animal models,  xxxd2529xxx  showed ~ 10-fold greater potency
than  xxxd358xxx  [39,42]. a study in hypertensive rats explored
whether  xxxd2529xxx  would be more effective than the etaselective era  xxxd138xxx  or the dual eta/etb era  xxxd358xxx .  xxxd2529xxx , administered at the time of maximal systemic
blood pressure decrease elicited by  xxxd138xxx  or  xxxd358xxx ,
further decreased systemic blood pressure, thus suggesting
that the efficacy of  xxxd2529xxx  is greater than the other
eras [43]. chronic administration of  xxxd2529xxx  in rats with
ph dose-dependently inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling and development of right ventricular hypertrophy and prolonged survival [39].
 xxxd2529xxx  has one active circulating metabolite,
act-132577 (see figure 1 and section 5.1), which is also a
dual eta/ xxxg677xxx  antagonist. in functional in vitro
assays (inhibition of contraction of isolated rat aorta and trachea), act-132577 is, on average, fivefold less potent than
 xxxd2529xxx . based on its pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics, act-132577 may contribute to
the overall pharmacological effect of  xxxd2529xxx .

clinical efficacy

seraphin (study with an endothelin receptor antagonist
in pulmonary arterial hypertension to improve clinical outcome) investigated whether long-term treatment with  xxxd2529xxx  would reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality in
pah patients (clinicaltrials.gov number: nct00660179).
this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup, event-driven phase iii study comprised 742 patients
aged 12 to 84 years with idiopathic or familial pah or

pah related to connective tissue disease (ctd), repaired
congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, hiv infection or
drugs and toxins. the diagnosis of pah was confirmed by
right heart catheterization. patients were required to have a
6mwd of ‡ 50 m and to be in class ii to class iv according
to the who functional classification. patients with symptomatic pah were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo (n = 250),
 xxxd2529xxx  3 mg (n = 250) or  xxxd2529xxx  10 mg (n = 242)
once daily. the doses of 3 and 10 mg investigated were
selected based on the results of phase i studies (increase in
plasma et-1 concentration) and from a dose-finding study
in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension [44].
the dose of 10 mg appeared to be on the plateau of the dose-response relationship, both for plasma et-1 increase and
blood pressure reduction. stable background oral or inhaled
pah therapy other than eras was allowed. clinical assessments (6mwd and who fc) and laboratory data were
obtained at screening and/or randomization, month 3, month
6 and every 6 months thereafter up to and including end of
treatment.  xxxg941xxx  (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and hemoglobin levels were measured
monthly up to 28 days after the end of treatment. the primary objective was assessed as the time from start of study
treatment to the first morbidity or mortality event observed
up to end of treatment + 7 days (table 1).
all components of the composite end point and the combined occurrence of the three constituents of ‘other worsening
of pah’ are highly clinically relevant in disease progression [24,45]. all primary end point events in the seraphin
study were adjudicated by an independent clinical event
committee, which was blinded to treatment allocation. secondary objectives of the trial were to demonstrate that either
dose of  xxxd2529xxx  improves pah symptoms (change in
6mwd from baseline to month 6, proportion of patients

with improvement in fc from baseline to month 6), reduces
the risk of death due to pah or hospitalization for pah and
improves survival. in a subset of patients, pulmonary blood

 xxxd2529xxx  at a dose of 3 mg/day versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.70; 97.5% ci: 0.52 -- 0.96; p = 0.01 by the logrank test) and
 xxxd2529xxx  at a dose of 10 mg/day versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.55; 97.5% ci: 0.39 -- 0.76; p < 0.001 by the logrank test).
the intention-to-treat analysis took into account all available data, whereas the kaplan--meier curve is truncated at
36 months.

clinical safety

a battery of preclinical studies performed in vitro or in vivo
following oral administration of  xxxd2529xxx  at pharmacological and supra-pharmacological doses has shown a favorable
safety pharmacology profile.  xxxd2529xxx  had no effect on
physiological function of the central and peripheral nervous
or respiratory systems or on cardiac repolarization or other
ecg variables. as shown for all eras,  xxxd2529xxx  displayed
teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits and, therefore, reliable
methods of contraception must be practiced by women of
childbearing potential when treated with  xxxd2529xxx .
safety in clinical studies
the safety and tolerability profile of  xxxd2529xxx  in clinical
pharmacology studies (see section 5) was unremarkable and
the highest doses tested following single- and multiple-dose
administration were 600 and 30 mg/day, respectively. with
respect to phase ii and phase iii studies, safety data are available for 863 patients who received  xxxd2529xxx  treatment and
370 patients who received placebo in randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies for a period of up to
188 weeks. this represents a total of 1120 patient-years exposure to  xxxd2529xxx  treatment and 484 patient-years exposure
to placebo treatment. in the pah indication, 492 and
4.1

249 patients were exposed to  xxxd2529xxx  and placebo treatment, respectively, during the double-blind study period.
together with the open-label extension to the pah study,
this represents a total of 1482 patient-years exposure to  xxxd2529xxx  (cut-off april 2012).
in the seraphin study, the overall incidence of adverse
events (aes) in the  xxxd2529xxx  groups was similar to that in
the placebo group and virtually all ae categories were well
balanced between the treatment groups. since primary end
point events were also reported as aes, worsening of pah
was the most frequently reported ae, but it occurred at a
lower incidence in the  xxxd2529xxx  groups, particularly in the
10 mg group (21.9%) compared to the placebo group
(34.9%). evaluation of the prevalence of aes, serious aes
(saes) and deaths over a period of more than 30 months
showed no increase in the proportion of patients with these
events on long-term  xxxd2529xxx  treatment.
similarly rhf, the most clinically relevant long-term complication of pah, was also reported at a lower incidence
(14.8, 13.2 and 22.5%) in the  xxxd2529xxx  3 and 10 mg and
placebo treatment groups, respectively.
 xxxd2529xxx  was generally well tolerated; aes were usually
mild and most of them were not dose-dependent. compared
with placebo, a higher proportion of  xxxd2529xxx -treated
patients had headache and respiratory aes, particularly those
affecting the upper respiratory tract, mainly nasopharyngitis.

doses (600 mg) or supratherapeutic doses (30 mg) for up to
10 days.
a relatively small phase ii trial (music, nct00903331)
in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf)
showed a favorable safety profile with respect to aminotransferase increases [54]. a total of 91 patients were treated with
 xxxd2529xxx  10 mg/day for a median period of 14.5 months.
in total, 3.4% of  xxxd2529xxx -treated patients and 5.1% of placebo recipients exhibited alt and/or ast elevations > 3 
the upper limit of normal (uln).
in the pivotal seraphin study, the proportion of
patients who had alt and/or ast elevations > 3  uln
was 4.0 and 3.4% in the  xxxd2529xxx  3 and 10 mg groups,
respectively, and 4.5% in the placebo group. it is also notable
that the overall incidence of reported aes denoting liver
abnormalities was lower in  xxxd2529xxx  10 mg (9.5%) compared to placebo (16.1%), and lower in  xxxd2529xxx  10 mg
(9.5%) versus  xxxd2529xxx  3 mg (12%), thus suggesting a
dose-related reduction. this may reflect the observation that
liver events in pah are frequently associated with worsening
of disease and associated rhf, both of which occur less frequently on efficacious treatment with  xxxd2529xxx .
the proportion of patients with alt and/or ast
elevations > 3  uln with or without total bilirubin > 2 
uln was comparable between the placebo group and the
two  xxxd2529xxx  groups. there were no patients who met the
hy’s law criteria of alt and/or ast > 3  uln, elevated
total bilirubin > 2  uln and no associated increase in alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of alternative explanations
which were possibly or likely the cause of the elevations,
that is, mainly worsening of pah and underlying congestive
heart failure. except for those cases associated with fatal outcome caused by the underlying disease, it is noteworthy that
all aminotransferase elevations (alt and/or ast > 3 
uln) resolved either on treatment discontinuation or, in a
few instances, on continued dosing.
as previously highlighted, congestive hepatopathy refers to
the spectrum of chronic liver injury attributed to passive
hepatic congestion that arises in the setting of rhf or any

cardiopulmonary disease leading to increased central venous
pressure. long-term passive congestion and relative ischemia
due to poor circulation are associated with pericentral liver
fibrosis and may cause cirrhosis [55]. the incidence of congestive hepatopathy, significant fibrosis or cardiac cirrhosis in
patients with significant heart failure has been estimated to
be between 15 and 65% [56]. liver histology was investigated
in 83 rhf patients. the presence of congestive changes was
apparent in nearly all specimens; however, significant fibrosis
associated with architectural distortion was present in 19%
and only one individual actually had cirrhosis [57].
patients with congestive hepatopathy may present with
asymptomatic liver enzyme abnormalities, jaundice (reflecting
increased total bilirubin), right upper quadrant discomfort,
anorexia, nausea and vomiting. cases of acute liver failure
resulting from severe heart dysfunction have also been
reported [58-60].
the results of four placebo-controlled clinical trials in pah
showed a background incidence of abnormal liver test values
(alt and/or ast > 3  uln) of 4% in 224 patients treated
with placebo and followed-up for 12 -- 28 weeks [61].
further, pah associated with ctd, including systemic
sclerosis (ssc) and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), is
part of group 1 of the dana point classification of ph (point
1.4.1). in the european  xxxd358xxx  post-marketing surveillance
program, 27% (1238 of 4623) of  xxxd358xxx -treated patients
presented with pah along with mixed ctd, ssc or
sle [62]. in the seraphin study, 30.5% of all patients
had pah related to collagen vascular disease. pathological
liver involvement in ctd patients has been documented in
the medical literature. a wide variety of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (such as sle, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, polymyositis, primary sj€ogren’s syndrome, ssc,
rheumatoid arthritis, and felty’s syndrome) affect the liver.
in addition, ~ 40% of idiopathic pah patients have circulating antibodies. their prevalence, significance and specific
hepatic pathology vary [63]. hepatic manifestations in autoimmune disease include chronic active hepatitis, autoimmune
hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia [63]. although
advanced liver disease with cirrhosis and liver failure in
ctd patients is rare, clinical and biochemical evidence of
associated liver abnormalities is common [64-69]. physical
examination of these patients may be unremarkable, but it
may also reveal hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice and
signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease. patients with
severe or fulminant symptoms accompanied by profound
jaundice and a prolonged prothrombin time may have aminotransferase levels in the thousands. in its most advanced form,
autoimmune hepatitis can progress to cirrhosis [70].
in summary, pah patients including those with concomitant ctd may develop cirrhosis and liver failure. hence,
hepatic comorbidity of pah and ctd is a significant confounding factor in the assessment of complex liver cases
reported in patients treated with eras.

based on the seraphin study, the kaplan--meier estimate of the hazard ratio for the first occurrence of alt
and/or ast > 3  uln as compared to placebo was
0.72 (95% ci: 0.30 -- 1.74) and 0.64 (0.26 -- 1.58) in the
3 and 10 mg groups, respectively. the kaplan--meier estimate
of the cumulative percentages of patients developing alt
and/or ast > 3  uln at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months remained
low for all treatments and time points. an observed apparent
higher incidence of alt and/or ast > 3  uln in the placebo arm compared to the  xxxd2529xxx  arms at 24 and
36 months is probably linked to progression of pah and
rhf and is mainly driven by ast elevations.  xxxd2529xxx 
liver test data are in line with those observed with  xxxd138xxx . the kaplan--meier estimate of the proportion of patients
with alt and/or ast > 3  uln at 6 months is 1.3% with
 xxxd2529xxx  10 mg versus 2.1% with  xxxd138xxx . at 1 year,
this estimate is 2.8% for  xxxd2529xxx  10 mg and 3.6% for
 xxxd138xxx  [71,72]. the second pivotal  xxxd358xxx  study in
pah (breathe-1) had shown an incidence of 14% over
12 weeks at the target dose of 250 mg/day [4] and a cumulative
11% (20 randomized clinical trials) [73].
based on the review of  xxxd2529xxx  preclinical and clinical
data, there is no definite hepatotoxicity signal from  xxxd2529xxx ; however, the complete exclusion of hepatotoxicity potential needs to be confirmed post-marketing with broader
patient exposure.
edema/fluid retention
 xxxd2529xxx  was designed to have a low impact on edema/fluid
retention through its dual eta and  xxxg677xxx  antagonism [34,39]. eta-selective eras may be more prone to cause
edema than dual eras [74]. no increase in edema aes was
seen in  xxxd2529xxx - versus placebo-treated subjects in
phase i studies. the phase ii study in a low number of ipf
patients showed a slightly increased incidence of peripheral
edema in  xxxd2529xxx - versus placebo-treated patients
(11.8 vs 6.8%) [54].
in the double-blind pah population (seraphin), aes
related to edema/fluid retention were reported at a similar
incidence across  xxxd2529xxx  and placebo treatment groups
( xxxd2529xxx  3 mg 20.0%,  xxxd2529xxx  10 mg 21.9% and placebo 20.5%). when adjusted for patient-years of exposure,
the incidences of these aes in  xxxd2529xxx  3 and 10 mg
(10.5 and 11.0 events/100 patient-years, respectively) were
actually lower than in placebo (12.5 events/100 patient-years).
saes relating to edema/fluid retention were reported less
frequently in  xxxd2529xxx  compared with placebo in the
double-blind pah population (0.8, 0.8 and 1.2% in the
 xxxd2529xxx  3 and 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively),
as well as in the pooled safety set from double-blind studies.
no pah patients discontinued  xxxd2529xxx  treatment due to
an ae of edema/fluid retention.
it is of note that the crude incidence of peripheral edema
during 10 mg  xxxd2529xxx  treatment was lower than with placebo in pah patients with more severe disease at baseline
4.3

(higher who fc or presence of signs/symptoms of rhf,
14.0% vs 21.8% for who fc iii iv and 17.1 vs 26.9%
for rhf, respectively). this may suggest that the beneficial
effect of  xxxd2529xxx  reduces the risk of peripheral edema
related to the underlying pah disease and its associated complications, such as rhf.
moreover, in patients who were receiving pah therapy at
baseline (primarily pde-5 inhibitors), peripheral edema was
reported at a lower incidence in  xxxd2529xxx  3 and 10 mg
(17.7 and 19.5%, respectively) compared to placebo (23.5%).
in the double-blind pah population, the number of
elderly patients (> 65 years) was 33, 27 and 44 in the maciten-

 xxxd2529xxx 

in hemoglobin concentration from baseline to trial completion has been observed with  xxxd358xxx  (0.9 g/dl) and  xxxd138xxx  (0.93 g/dl with  xxxd138xxx  10 mg and 0.84 g/dl for
all  xxxd138xxx  doses combined). in placebo-controlled studies (of all uses of  xxxd358xxx ), a decrease in hemoglobin ‡ 15%
from baseline resulting in values < 11 g/dl was observed in 6%
of  xxxd358xxx -treated and 3% of placebo-treated patients [73]. in
aries-1 and aries-2, 6.5% of patients receiving  xxxd138xxx  had decreases in hemoglobin ‡ 15% from baseline, which
fell below the lower limit of normal [76].
anemia was reported as an ae for 8.8% of patients in the
 xxxd2529xxx  3 mg group and for 13.2% of patients in the
 xxxd2529xxx  10 mg group. in the placebo group, the incidence
was lower at 3.2%. severe anemia was the cause of discontinuation in only one patient at each  xxxd2529xxx  dose and in the
placebo group.
cases of anemia requiring blood transfusion have been
reported with  xxxd2529xxx  as with other eras. in the
double-blind pah population, in patients who experienced
hemoglobin concentration < 10 g/dl (5.8 and 8.7% of
patients on  xxxd2529xxx  3 and 10 mg, respectively, compared
with 3.4% of patients on placebo), the decreases were associated with a medical history of anemia or were reported in the
setting of concurrent clinical events including bleeding, iron
or vitamin deficiency, whereas in some patients decreased
hemoglobin was detected when the patient experienced cardiac failure and edema and/or renal failure.
other risk factors in the patient population included the
use of concomitant anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors and, in
some patients (with rheumatoid autoimmune diseases such
as ctd) corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. indeed,
compared to the general population, pah patients have a
higher incidence of comorbidities that predispose to bleeding
and anemia including cardiac failure and complications
of ctd.
importantly, severe anemia in  xxxd2529xxx -treated patients
does not appear to be related to a specific mechanism and is
not different from the anemia in patients receiving placebo.
therefore, these severe cases of anemia can be most probably
attributed to underlying conditions.
these data are very similar to the changes observed in
patients treated with two other eras ( xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx ) based on both preclinical and clinical studies. the
preclinical studies provided strong evidence against hemolysis or bone marrow toxicity as mechanism of hemoglobin
concentration decrease. both these mechanisms are also
very unlikely in  xxxd2529xxx -treated patients since mean corpuscular volume did not change. accordingly, by deduction,
the most probable explanation is an increase in plasma volume, as had been already proposed for other eras [77]. the
effect of plasma expansion of ~ 140 ml is modest and clinically not considered of relevance. the extent is derived
from a 3% era-associated hematocrit reduction, a normal
plasma volume of 30 ml/kg and a normal hematocrit value
of 45%.

increased plasma volume due to vasodilatation and
decreased vascular permeability is a potential mechanism
that could explain the hematological observations. et-1 is a
potent vasoconstrictor and as such has experimentally been
shown to be associated with a decrease in plasma volume
and an increase in hematocrit without a change in red blood
cell mass. these observations could also be related to the ability of et-1 to increase capillary permeability. it is expected
that these effects would be reversed by an era, especially in
situations of increased plasma et concentrations (e.g.,
in pah).
this expansion is probably not ‘hemodilution’ as
observed after infusion of intravenous (i.v.) fluids since
sodium and albumin concentrations did not decrease but
is very similar to the ‘pseudo-anemia’ that is physiologically
observed during pregnancy. in this situation, the hemoglobin decrease was shown to result from an increase in red
blood cell volume masked by a larger increase in
plasma volume.
based on clinical experience in the double-blind seraphin study and extensive post-marketing experience with
eras, anemia was clinically manageable.
in summary, effects of  xxxd2529xxx  on hemoglobin concentration and incidence and severity of reported cases of
anemia are very similar to the changes observed in patients
treated with  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx  based on both preclinical and clinical studies. the data indicate that  xxxd2529xxx  exhibits a moderate, non-progressive and dose-related
hemoglobin reduction.
although many more patients have been exposed to  xxxd2529xxx  in phase iii than to any other pah drug, its safety profile can only be firmly established post-marketing.

clinical pharmacology

pharmacokinetics and metabolism
the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of  xxxd2529xxx  and its
active metabolite act-132577 have been extensively studied
in healthy subjects. the pharmacokinetics have also been
investigated in the target pah population as well as in
patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
after single-dose administration studied over a wide dose
range from 0.2 to 600 mg in healthy subjects,  xxxd2529xxx 
was slowly absorbed with a median tmax varying from 8 to
30 h. after attainment of cmax, plasma concentrations
decreased slowly with an approximate half-life of 16 h [78].
the active metabolite act-132577 was slowly formed with
a disposition half-life between ~ 40 and 60 h. after
multiple-dose administration of  xxxd2529xxx  at doses ranging
from 1 to 30 mg, the pharmacokinetics of both  xxxd2529xxx 
and act-132577 were consistent with those observed in
the single-ascending dose study with half-lives of ~ 16 and
48 h, respectively. accumulation of  xxxd2529xxx  was limited,
whereas act-132577 accumulated substantially, with an
increase in exposure between steady-state versus day 1 of

8.5-fold on average [79]. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2529xxx 
and act-132577 were dose-proportional over the range
from 1 to 30 mg. steady-state conditions were reached at
day 7 and the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2529xxx  was consistent with once-daily dosing [79]. these properties give  xxxd2529xxx  the profile of a so-called forgiving drug, that is, small
fluctuations in exposure over a dosing interval and still reasonable exposure following omission of a dose. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 were not influenced
by food, age, sex or ethnic origin [80]. in addition, pharmacokinetics of both compounds in pah patients in a substudy of
the seraphin trial (see section 3) were similar to those in
healthy subjects.  xxxd358xxx  led to higher exposure in pah
patients compared to healthy subjects at the same dosing regimen, probably because its clearance is more dependent on
liver blood flow [81].
in human plasma, two circulating metabolites have been
identified (figure 1): active metabolite act-132577 formed
by oxidative depropylation and the pharmacologically inactive
metabolite act-373898 formed by oxidative cleavage of the
bromopyrimidine group, yielding a carboxylic acid [82]. after
single-dose administration, total plasma exposure to  xxxd2529xxx , act-132577 and act-373898 were ~ 26, 71 and 3%,
respectively, of total radioactivity. conversion of  xxxd2529xxx 
to act-132577 was predominantly catalyzed by
cyp3a4 with cyp2c19 playing a minor role. these metabolites subsequently undergo further reactions to form additional metabolites that are excreted in urine and feces [82].
both kidney and liver are important elimination routes.
this has been demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies performed in renally or hepatically impaired patients [83,84]. in
these patient populations, no clinically relevant differences
in  xxxd2529xxx  or act-132577 pharmacokinetics have been
observed, suggesting that impairment of one elimination
route can be compensated by the other.
in vitro and in vivo data showed that  xxxd2529xxx  is not a
substrate of p-glycoprotein (p-gp); hepatic uptake is mostly
driven by passive diffusion and is not dependent on organic
anion-transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ) transport [85]. therefore,  xxxd2529xxx  will not accumulate in the liver, which has
important safety aspects (see section 5.2).

drug--drug interactions
weiss et al. showed in a recent publication that in vitro  xxxd2529xxx  was an inducer of cyp3a4 as well as an inducer and
inhibitor of several transporters such as p-gp [86]. however,
at clinically relevant concentrations, these properties are not
manifested, also in view of the high in vivo plasma protein
binding of  xxxd2529xxx  and its pharmacologically
active metabolite.
various clinical studies have demonstrated the low interaction potential of  xxxd2529xxx  at a dose of 10 mg, the maximum
dose used in clinical development of pah, with medications
that could be used concomitantly in patients.
5.2

400

 xxxd2529xxx  did neither affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin (s- and r-enantiomers) nor its pharmacodynamic
parameters, international normalized ratio and factor
vii [87].  xxxd138xxx  behaves similarly as  xxxd2529xxx  whereas
 xxxd358xxx , because of its enzyme-inducing properties, leads to
lower exposure to warfarin [88,89].
in contrast to the eras  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx ,  xxxd2529xxx  is not a substrate of  xxxg2163xxx  as demonstrated in a
drug--drug interaction study with cyclosporine, a potent
inhibitor of this transporter [85,90,91]. whereas  xxxd358xxx  and
 xxxd138xxx  exposure was increased in the presence of cyclosporine, no clinically relevant differences were observed for
 xxxd2529xxx . eras that are actively transported into the liver,
and subsequently leading to increased hepatic drug concentrations, may be associated with liver injury [92]. thus, the
improved liver safety profile of  xxxd2529xxx  (see section
4.2) may also be related to this drug feature. in addition,
 xxxd2529xxx  can be dosed concomitantly with other  xxxg2163xxx 
inhibitors, without need for dose adjustments, for example,
ritonavir.
further, no clinically relevant differences were observed on
pharmacokinetic variables of either compound or their respective metabolites when  xxxd2529xxx  and sildenafil were concomitantly administered, which is important as international
guidelines have highlighted the clinical benefits of combination therapy for pah with eras and pde-5 inhibitors [93-95].
further, sildenafil serves as a prototype cyp3a4 substrate,
indicating that no pharmacokinetic interactions are expected
between  xxxd2529xxx  and other cyp3a4 substrates, including
many drug classes such as calcium channel blockers and hormonal contraceptives. coadministration of  xxxd358xxx  and sildenafil leads to lower exposure to the latter, although this is
not considered clinically relevant [96,97]. no pharmacokinetic
interaction was demonstrated between  xxxd138xxx  and
sildenafil [98].
clinical drug--drug interaction studies with a cyp3a4
inhibitor and inducer indicated an effect on  xxxd2529xxx  pharmacokinetics [85,99]. in the presence of the strong
cyp3a4 inhibitor ketoconazole, the exposure to  xxxd2529xxx 
increased by approximately a factor of 2 and to
act-132577 was reduced by ~ 26% [99]. as the increase in
exposure to  xxxd2529xxx  was within the exposure seen within
the dose ranges studied in the single- and multiple-ascending
dose studies and  xxxd2529xxx  was well tolerated in this study,
the data suggest that  xxxd2529xxx  would not need dose adjustment when concomitantly administered with cyp3a4 inhibitors. in contrast, concomitant treatment with rifampin
caused a marked decrease of 80% in exposure to  xxxd2529xxx .
while the exposure to act-132577 was not impacted in the
presence of rifampin, reduced efficacy of  xxxd2529xxx  in the
presence of rifampin should be considered as in vitro
act-132577 was approximately fivefold less potent than
 xxxd2529xxx  [39]. in the presence of ketoconazole, exposure to
 xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx  approximately doubled and
increased by 35%, respectively [100,101]. taken together, the

drug--drug interaction data suggest that the profile of  xxxd2529xxx  is improved compared to that of  xxxd358xxx  and
 xxxd138xxx  [102].

conclusion

 xxxd2529xxx  is a dual eta and etb era with optimized physicochemical properties compared to marketed eras. the
drug shows enhanced tissue penetration and sustained receptor occupancy compared to  xxxd138xxx  and  xxxd358xxx .  xxxd2529xxx  can be administered once daily, partly due to the
formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite with a
longer half-life. no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2529xxx  or its active metabolite have been
observed in patients with chronic renal or hepatic impairment
compared to healthy subjects. it has shown a low propensity
for drug--drug interactions and is not a substrate of liver
drug transporters. although eras have been used in the treatment of pah for more than a decade,  xxxd2529xxx  has been
investigated in the first large-scale morbidity/mortality study
with a long-term outcome. the drug significantly reduced
the risk of morbidity and mortality in pah patients. benefits
were demonstrated in both treatment-naı̈ve patients and those
on background pah therapy with a favorable safety profile.

expert opinion

since the beginning of the millennium, the treatment of pah
patients has advanced considerably. until then only epoprostenol, i.v. administered via a central line, was available. with
the introduction of the era  xxxd358xxx  in 2001, which can be
orally administered, treatment options greatly improved, also
for patients in earlier stages of the disease [103]. currently,
three classes of drugs (eras, pde-5 inhibitors and prostanoids) have been approved by regulatory authorities, although
prostanoids are not available for the oral route. the pathways
targeted by these drugs are endothelin,  xxxd2738xxx  and prostacyclin, the latter two being vasodilatatory molecules, which
are decreased in pah. vasoconstrictive and proliferative
et-1 is increased in pah.  xxxd3127xxx , an oral soluble  xxxg1587xxx  stimulator, has been recently approved by the
fda [104]. in addition, the receptor  xxxg2198xxx  antagonist
imatinib has been studied in advanced trials but appears to be
further away from the market [105,106]. the expansion of the
therapeutic armamentarium has increased the use of combination therapies in the treatment of pah [106-110] and has raised
the question whether initiation of combination therapy in
treatment-naı̈ve patients is superior to initiating monotherapy. results of randomized clinical trials evaluating different
drug combinations are eagerly awaited.
 xxxd2529xxx  appears to offer several advantages over existing
eras, based on in vitro and in vivo animal studies. the pivotal phase iii seraphin trial conducted with  xxxd2529xxx 
can be considered a landmark study in the pah field and
has generated a wealth of clinically highly useful information.

thus far, it represents the largest prospective clinical study in
pah and in its objectives has gone beyond the mainly symptomatic treatment benefits detected in relatively short-term
clinical trials performed with other pah treatments. the primary end point has been a composite morbidity/mortality
one which encompasses highly clinically relevant components.
death, atrial septostomy and lung transplantation are clear
and indisputable events of pah deterioration, whereas initiation of i.v. or subcutaneous (s.c.) prostanoids introduces an
invasive procedure that is relevant to the patient and constitutes an important aspect of pah worsening. most events
in seraphin were ‘other worsening of pah’, the clinical
relevance of which was strengthened by the requirement for
the simultaneous occurrence of components of confirmed
deterioration in exercise capacity, symptomatic worsening
and need for additional pah-specific therapy. another new
feature to the design of seraphin was that consistency
and rigor of assessment of the composite primary end point
were ensured by the adjudication of all events by an independent clinical event committee in a blinded manner.
based on currently available data over a median treatment
duration of 115 weeks,  xxxd2529xxx  has a good tolerability
and safety profile. in terms of the risk of liver test abnormalities,  xxxd2529xxx  appears to have a better safety profile compared with  xxxd358xxx  and similar to  xxxd138xxx . the large
number of patients in seraphin enabled shedding more
light on the influence of hepatic comorbidity in pah and
ctd, which is a complex confounding factor in the assessment of liver cases in patients treated with eras. with respect
to edema/fluid retention,  xxxd2529xxx  compares favorably, in
particular, to  xxxd138xxx .  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd138xxx  are
both substrates of liver drug transporters which makes them
susceptible to interactions with drugs having an influence on
these transporters. in addition,  xxxd358xxx  is an inducer of several cyp isoenzymes leading to potentially reduced efficacy
on concomitant administration of drugs which are substrates
of these cyps. the low likelihood of eliciting drug--drug
interactions makes  xxxd2529xxx  an appropriate drug to test different combination therapies [95].
the properties of  xxxd2529xxx  make it a good candidate to
study its usefulness in a spectrum of other disorders.
currently, the drug is being investigated in eisenmenger’s
syndrome, ssc associated digital ulcers and recurrent glioblastoma -- diseases in which et may play an important role.
