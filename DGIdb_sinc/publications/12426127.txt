arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen associated with cancers of the skin, lung, liver,
and bladder. interestingly, arsenic has also been used as an effective chemotherapeutic agent in the
treatment of certain human cancers. however, the mechanisms by which arsenic induces proliferation of cancer cells or cancer cell death are not well understood. we found that exposure of jb6
p+ cells to low concentrations of arsenic induces cell transformation, whereas higher concentrations of arsenic induce cell apoptosis. arsenite induces phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (erks) and c-jun nh2-terminal kinases (jnks). arsenite-induced erk
activation was markedly inhibited by introduction of dominant-negative  xxxg1366xxx  into cells, whereas
expression of dominant-negative  xxxg1366xxx  did not inhibit jnks or mitogen-activated protein kinase
erk kinase 1/2. furthermore, arsenite-induced cell transformation was blocked in cells expressing
dominant-negative  xxxg1366xxx . in contrast, overexpression of dominant-negative  xxxg1370xxx  increased cell
transformation even though it inhibited arsenite-induced jnk activation. arsenic also induced
ap-1 and nuclear factor kappa b ( xxxg1559xxx ) activation. blocking  xxxg1559xxx  activation by dominantnegative inhibitory kappa betaalpha inhibited arsenic-induced apoptosis and enhanced arsenic-induced
cell transformation. arsenic induced activation of jnks at a similar dose range that was effective
for induction of apoptosis in jb6 cells. in addition, we found that arsenic did not induce p53dependent transactivation. similarly, apoptosis induction was not different between p53 wild-type
(p53+/+) or p53-deficient (p53–/–) cells. in contrast, arsenic-induced apoptosis was almost totally
blocked by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of jnk. taken together with previous findings that p53 mutations are involved in approxmiately 50% of all human cancers and nearly all
chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells mainly by apoptotic induction, we suggest that arsenic
may be a useful agent for the treatment of cancers with p53 mutations. these results suggest that
the activation of erks is required for arsenic-induced cell transformation, whereas the activation of
jnks and  xxxg1559xxx  is involved in arsenic-induced apoptosis of jb6 cells. key words: ap-1, apoptosis, arsenic, cell transformation, map kinase,  xxxg1559xxx , signal transduction. environ health

arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen and is associated with an increased risk of
human cancers of the skin, lung, and bladder
(chen et al. 1985; forkner and mcnair-scott
1931; kandel and leroy 1937; konig et al.
1997; nriagu 1994; smith et al. 1992;
sommers and mcmanus 1953). interestingly,
arsenic-containing compounds have been
used for treatment of cancer for hundreds of
years in both traditional chinese and
western medicine (chen et al. 1996, 1997;
forkner and mcnair-scott 1931; kandel and
leroy 1937; konig et al. 1997). several
recent studies confirm that  xxxd226xxx 
appears to be a valuable therapeutic tool for
patients with acute  xxxg1785xxx 
(chen et al. 1996, 1997).
although arsenic and its modes of
action have been the subject of reviews and
symposia, little data exist regarding specific
mechanism(s) differentiating its action as
a carcinogen to cause cancer and as a
chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment
of cancer. recently, our laboratory findings
provided mechanisms of arsenic-induced neoplastic cell transformation and arsenicinduced apoptosis in tumor cells (bode and
environmental health perspectives

dong 2000, 2002; chen et al. 2000a, 2000b;
huang et al. 1999a, 1999b, 2001) (figure 1).

arsenic induces cell transformation
much of the lack of progress in determining
mechanisms explaining the role of arsenic as a
carcinogen or as a chemotherapeutic agent
has been attributed to the availability of valid
and reproducible animal models. to study
whether arsenite induces cell transformation,
we exposed jb6 cl 41 cells to arsenite in soft
agar. anchorage-independent colonies were
observed in the eighth week after arsenite
exposure. cell transformation can only be
observed in cells exposed to 0.5–25 µm
arsenite, whereas no transformed colonies
were observed at higher concentrations of
arsenite (50–100 µm) because of the toxicity
of arsenic (huang et al. 1999a, 1999b).

induction of apoptosis by higher
concentrations of arsenic
a higher concentration of arsenic appears to
prevent cell transformation by inducing
apoptosis. we showed that treatment of
cells with a relatively higher concentration
(200 µm) of arsenite or arsenate resulted in

• volume 110 | supplement 5 | october 2002

apoptosis by 44.5 and 61.5%, respectively
(chen et al. 2000b).

differential activation of erks and
jnks by arsenite
we found that arsenite could induce activation of both c-jun nh 2 -terminal kinases
(jnks) and extracellular signal-regulated
protein kinases (erks) (huang et al. 1999a,
1999b). however, the activation of jnks
and erks by arsenite differs in time course
and dose response. during the time course
and dose–response studies, marked erks activation could be observed 15 min after exposure and at all dosages studied, but no
significant induction of erks by arsenite
occurred after a 30-min exposure. in contrast, arsenic activation of jnks was observed
only at a relatively high dosage (>50 µm)
and after 60 min of exposure.

arsenic induces ap-1 activation
in cells and ap-1-luciferase
transgenic mice
using jb6 cells, we found that both arsenite
and arsenate could induce transactivation of
ap-1 (huang et al. 2001). this induction of
ap-1 activity by arsenic appears to occur
through activation of mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases and protein kinase c
(pkc) because increased ap-1 activity by
arsenite could be blocked by either treating
cells with  xxxd1169xxx , an map kinase erk
kinase (mek)1 inhibitor, or overexpression
of dominant-negative  xxxg1837xxx  (chen et al.
2000a; huang 2001). furthermore, both
arsenite and arsenate could induce transactivation of ap-1 in ap-1-luciferase reporter
transgenic mice (huang 2001).

inhibition of erks activation blocks
arsenic-induced cell transformation
the results described above revealed that
erks activation by arsenite may be involved
in its cell transformation activity. to test
this possibility, we used dominant-negative

 xxxd1169xxx , an inhibitor of erks, and dominant-negative mutant (dnm)- xxxg1370xxx  blocked
arsenite-induced apoptosis, whereas dnmp38 kinase or sb2020190, an inhibitor of p38
kinase, did not. we conclude that erks and
jnks may be involved in arsenite-induced
apoptosis, and the inhibition of arseniteinduced apoptosis by egcg and theaflavins
may be mediated by a decreased phosphorylation of erks and jnks. furthermore, these
results provide a possible mechanism explaining the detoxification effect of tea on arseniteinduced toxicity (chen et al. 2000b).

 xxxg1366xxx -k52r stable transfectants (chen et al.
2000b; huang 1999a, 1999b). our results
demonstrate that erk activation but not
jnk activation is required for arseniteinduced cell transformation.

inhibition of jnks blocks arsenicinduced apoptosis
to investigate the role of activation of jnks
in arsenic-induced apoptosis, we used jb6
cells and a dominant-negative mutant of
 xxxg1370xxx  to test the effects on arsenic-induced
apoptosis (huang et al. 1999a). expression of
the dominant-negative mutant  xxxg1370xxx  blocked
induction of apoptosis by arsenite (4%) or
arsenate (7%) compared with vector-transfected control cells (31.5 and 40.5% for
arsenite and arsenate, respectively) (sommers
and mcmanus 1953).

p53 is not involved in induction
of apoptosis by arsenic
arsenic had no effect on p53-dependent transcription activation in cl 41 p53 cells treated
with a wide dose range of arsenic (huang
et al. 1999a). this suggested that p53 may not
be involved in arsenic-induced apoptosis. this
hypothesis was further tested by studying the
effects of arsenic on two fibroblast cell lines
derived from mouse embryos either containing wild-type p53 (p53+/+) or deficient in p53
(p53–/–). results showed that treatment with
arsenite or arsenate results in apoptosis in both
cell lines (huang et al. 1999a). therefore,
arsenic may be effective in counteracting drug
resistance in p53-deficient cancers because
arsenic appears to be able to induce apoptosis

in tumor cells independently of p53 activation
and thus could be specifically directed against
p53-defective cancer cells.

involvement of pkc in arsenicinduced signal transduction
our recent data show that pkc, upstream
from the map kinases, may be involved in
mediating arsenite-induced signal transduction (chen et al. 2000a). translocation of
pkc from the cytosol to the membrane is a
critical step for activation of this enzyme,
and treatment of jb6 cells with arsenite
resulted in an increased translocation of pkc
within 15 min. inhibition of activation of
pkc blocked both arsenite-induced ap-1
activity and arsenite-induced phosphorylation of erks, jnks, and p38 kinase, suggesting that pkc is required for arsenite-induced
activation of map kinases.

tea polyphenols block arsenicinduced signal transduction and
cytotoxicity
arsenite-induced apoptosis appears to be
important in accounting for its toxicity. green
tea has been used as a traditional chinese
remedy for detoxification of arsenite-caused
toxicity. in recent work, we found that tea
polyphenols, (–)- xxxd2006xxx 
(egcg) and theaflavins, effectively blocked
arsenite-induced apoptosis in jb6 cells and
inhibited arsenite-induced ap-1 transcriptional activation and ap-1 dna-binding
activity (chen et al. 2000b). egcg and
theaflavins potently inhibited arsenite-induced
erk activity but not p38 kinase activity.
volume

nuclear factor kappa b ( xxxg1559xxx ) is a rapidly
induced stress-responsive transcription factor
that may play an important role in arsenicinduced signal transduction, cell transformation, and apoptosis (bode and dong 2000,
2002). barchowsky et al. (1996,1999)
reported that arsenic-induced oxidant stress,
h2o2, and superoxide are the predominant
reactive species in endothelia cells and may be
the mediators for the activation of the  xxxg1559xxx 
pathway. we showed that arsenic induced
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  in different cell culture
models. expression of a dominant-negative
inhibitory kappa betaalpha blocked arsenic-induced
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  and apoptosis.

conclusions
arsenic is clearly a human carcinogen, but also
acts as a beneficial chemotherapeutic agent.
the lack of information regarding its mechanisms of action has been attributed to the
availability of appropriate animal models. in
the past few years we have established cell culture models to study arsenic-induced neoplastic cell transformation and apoptosis. others
have also reported that exposure of arsenic
could induce cell transformation in a rat liver
epithelial cell line (trl 1215) (meng and
meng 2000) or in blast transformation and
dna synthesis in human lymphocytes (zhao
et al. 1997). we found that arsenic significantly affects specific signal transduction pathways (figure 1). our data provided a model
for the role of signaling molecules including
map kinases, p53, ap-1, and  xxxg1559xxx  in
arsenic-induced cell transformation and apoptosis. more detailed studies are needed to
determine precise mechanisms of the effects of
arsenic on animals and humans.
