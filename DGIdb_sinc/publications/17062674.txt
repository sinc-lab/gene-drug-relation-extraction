abstract

purpose: glucocorticoids such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone are known
to provide some clinical benefit for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. however,
the underlying mechanisms by which glucocorticoids affect hormone-refractory prostate cancer
progression are not well established as yet. our previous study has shown that glucocorticoids
inhibit tumor angiogenesis possibly by down-regulation of  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf) and  xxxg562xxx . here, we hypothesized that the therapeutic effect of dexamethasone
on hormone-refractory prostate cancer can be partly attributed to a direct inhibition of lymphangiogenesis through the  xxxg1601xxx  by down-regulating a major lymphangiogenic
factor,vegf-c.
experimental design: the effects of dexamethasone on the expression of vegf-c and its
receptor, vegf receptor-3 ( xxxg802xxx ), were examined using an androgen-independent human
prostate cancer cell line, du145, which expresses  xxxg1601xxx . the effects of dexamethasone on tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis in du145 xenografts were determined by
analyzingvegf-c gene expression, lymphatic vessel density, and relative lymphatic vessel area.
results: dexamethasone significantly down-regulated vegf-c gene expression and protein
production by 48% (p = 0.003) and 44% (p = 0.002), respectively, under normoxic condition.
similarly, hydrocortisone down-regulated vegf-c gene expression. the effects of dexamethasone were completely reversed by the  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist ru486. even under
hypoxia-like conditions, dexamethasone inhibitedvegf-c gene expression. in du145 xenografts,
dexamethasone significantly down-regulated vegf-c gene expression and decreased lymphangiogenesis. dexamethasone did not affect  xxxg802xxx  gene expression in vitro and in vivo.
conclusion: glucocorticoids suppressed tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis by downregulating vegf-c through  xxxg1601xxx  in androgen-independent prostate cancer
cells in vivo.

prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and
the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the
united states (1), and the number of prostate cancer patients
has been rapidly increasing in japan (2). prostate cancer is
proposed to change the initial property of androgen-dependent
growth to androgen-independent and finally hormone-refractory growth through hormonal therapy (3). among several
treatment options, glucocorticoids (i.e., prednisone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone) are known to provide some benefit
for hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients. accumulating
evidence of clinical effects of glucocorticoids on hormonerefractory prostate cancer showed a >50% decline in prostatespecific antigen levels in 20% to 79% of patients with
hormone-refractory prostate cancer (4 – 7). glucocorticoids

are therefore recognized as one of a limited number of
treatment options for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
the distinct mechanism of glucocorticoids for hormonerefractory prostate cancer remains ill defined. to date, the
effects of glucocorticoids have been proposed to be due to the
inhibitory effects on adrenal androgen production (8, 9) and
cell proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells
(10). more recently, our group showed that dexamethasone, a
synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses androgen-independent
prostate cancer growth in vivo, possibly due to the inhibition
of tumor-associated angiogenesis by decreasing  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) and  xxxg562xxx  productions
directly through  xxxg1601xxx  (11), and that in renal
cell carcinoma cell lines, dexamethasone suppresses vegf
expression in vitro (12).
lymphatic spread has been implicated in poor prognosis in
various neoplasms, and tumor lymphangiogenesis is a fundamental event in the process of lymphogenic metastasis (13).
vegf-c pathway is well documented as one of the key
regulators of tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymph node
metastasis (14 – 16). in prostate cancer, vegf-c expression
was recently shown to be positively associated with high
pathologic grade, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis
(17, 18). in the present study, we hypothesized that the
therapeutic effect of dexamethasone on hormone-refractory

glucocorticoids suppresstumor lymphangiogenesis

prostate cancer can be partly attributed to the direct inhibition
of lymphangiogenesis through  xxxg1601xxx  by
down-regulating a major lymphangiogenic factor, vegf-c. to
elucidate the mechanism by which dexamethasone suppresses
lymphangiogenesis is an important initial step for designing
strategies and identifying therapeutic targets for hormonerefractory prostate cancer. to confirm this hypothesis, we
examined vegf-c gene expression and protein production by
dexamethasone-treated du145 cells, an androgen-independent
prostate cancer cell line known to express functional glucocorticoid receptors (10).

materials and methods
cell culture and drug treatment. three human prostate cancer cell
lines, du145, pc-3, and lncap, were obtained from the american
type culture collection (manassas, va) and maintained in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 ag/ml streptomycin at 37jc and 5% co2. for
treatment, cells were plated at 2  103 per well in 96-well assay plates
with 100 al of medium with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped
fbs, at 2  104 per well in 24-well plates with 500 al of medium, or at
4  105 per dish in 60-mm dishes with 3 ml of medium. after 12 to
24 hours of incubation, cells were treated with 2% dextran-coated
charcoal-stripped fbs with or without the test agents. dexamethasone,
hydrocortisone,  xxxd3240xxx , and ru486 were purchased
from sigma (st. louis, mo). ru486 was used as a glucocorticoid
receptor antagonist.
hypoxia-like conditions were chemically created by exposure of cells
to 100 amol/l cobalt chloride (cocl2; sigma) treated at 37jc and 5%
co2 for 12 hours. cellular responses to either hypoxia or cocl2 have
been shown to share a common mechanism for oxygen sensing, signal
transduction, and transcriptional regulation in several previous reports
(19, 20).
reverse transcription-pcr. total rna was extracted from the
prostate cancer cells using isogene according to the instructions of
the manufacturer (wako, osaka, japan). cdna was synthesized using a
thermoscript rt system (invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca) with 2 ag of
total rna from each of the prostate cancer cell lines (du145, pc-3, and
lncap) and produced in final volumes of 20 al. to evaluate the mrna
expression levels of vegf-c and its receptor, vegf receptor-3 ( xxxg802xxx ), the ratios of vegf-c and  xxxg802xxx  to the glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) mrna expression were measured
with real-time quantitative pcr using a lightcycler system as
previously reported (11). sybr green i dye (roche molecular systems,
indianapolis, in) was used for vegf-c and  xxxg861xxx  pcrs, and sybr
premix ex taq (takara bio, inc., shiga, japan) for  xxxg802xxx  pcr. the
vegf-c and  xxxg861xxx  primers were obtained from search-lc (heidelberg, germany) and vefgr-3 primer was from takara bio. pcr
conditions were programmed according to the instructions of the
suppliers. fluorescent products were measured by a single acquisition
mode after each cycle. the expression of vegf-c,  xxxg802xxx , and
 xxxg861xxx  in each sample was quantified in separate tubes. to distinguish
specific and nonspecific products and primer dimers, a melting curve
was obtained.
cell lysate preparation and protein assays for vegf-c and total
protein. prostate cancer cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes at 1.2 
106 per dish in rpmi 1640 containing 10% dextran-coated charcoalstripped fbs for 24 hours, after which the medium was replaced with
fresh medium containing 2% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fbs with
or without test agents for further 24 hours. protein solution of each cell
line was assayed for vegf-c and total protein concentrations according
to previously reported methods (16, 21) with some modifications.
briefly, the cells were collected and suspended in 1 of ml radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (sigma) with 1 mmol/l phenyl-

methanesulfonyl fluoride (fluka, buchs, switzerland). the suspensions
were centrifuged at 12,000  g and the supernatants were stored at
20jc until protein assay. to evaluate vegf-c protein concentrations,
the ratios of vegf-c to total protein were measured with human vegfc assay kit-ibl (ibl co., ltd. takasaki, japan) and autokit micro tp
(wako) according to the instructions of the manufacturers.
in vivo xenograft model. animal studies complied with the
animal welfare regulation of tokyo medical and dental university.
to establish a du145 tumor xenograft model, du145 cells were
detached with trypsin, and a mixture of rpmi 1640 with 10% fbs
containing du145 cells and matrigel basement membrane matrix
(1:1, v/v; bd biosciences, bedford, ma) was prepared immediately
before inoculation. the cells (1  107) were placed in the dorsal s.c.
space of 6-week-old male balb/c (nu/nu) mice. when the average
tumor volume reached 200 to 300 mm3, f2 weeks after inoculation,
mice were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group
(nine mice each). in the experimental group, each mouse was given a
s.c. peritumor injection thrice a week of 1 ag dexamethasone, which
had been dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1:2,000 in 100-al sterile
saline, whereas in the control group, ethanol diluted 1:2,000 in 100al sterile saline was injected. the tumor volumes were measured
weekly and calculated according to the following formula: length 
width2 / 2. the mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after the treatment and
the tumors were removed and then either frozen for mrna
extraction or fixed in 10% buffered formalin for immunohistochemical analysis.
immunohistochemical analysis of lymphatic vessel density and relative
lymphatic vessel area. paraffin-embedded sections (5 am thick) from
du145 xenograft tumors were placed on slides, deparaffinized, and
rehydrated. subsequently, the sections were microwaved thrice at
500 w for 5 minutes to improve antigen retrieval and incubated with
3% (v/v)  xxxd2298xxx  in pbs for 20 minutes at room temperature
to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. after the sections were
blocked with 10% goat  xxxg124xxx  for 30 minutes at room
temperature, they were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with
a rat monoclonal anti-mouse antibody against the lymphatic endothelial marker podoplanin (angiobio co., del mar, ca) at a concentration
of 10 ag/ml in pbs. the sections were then rinsed thrice with pbs,
incubated with goat anti-rat secondary antibody diluted 1:100 in pbs
(santa cruz biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca) for 30 minutes at
room temperature, and exposed to the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex (r.t.u. vectastain abc reagent, vector laboratories, inc.,
burlingame, ca) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. the
sections were visualized by incubating the slides with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (histofine simple stain dab solution, nichirei, tokyo,
japan) as chromogen and counterstained with meyer’s hematoxylin
(muto pure chemicals co., ltd., tokyo, japan). negative controls
were included by replacement of the primary antibody with pbs and
showed no specific staining.
lymphatic vessel density was assessed by procedures as previously
reported (21, 22). briefly, areas with the highest neolymphangiogenesis
were found by scanning the tumor sections with light microscopy at
low magnification (40 and 100). individual lymphatic vessel counts
were made at the areas on a 200 field (20 objective and 10 ocular,
0.74 mm2 per field). any brown-stained lymphatic endothelial cell or
endothelial cluster, clearly separated from adjacent blood vessels, tumor
cells, and other connective tissue elements, was considered a single,
countable lymphatic vessel. the results were independently reviewed by
two blinded authors (y.f. and a.i.) and two areas of highest lymphatic
vessel density identified within any single 200 field were selected from
each sample. data were expressed as the average of these highest counts.
to confirm the results of lymphatic vessel density, relative lymphatic
vessel area was evaluated by computer-assisted quantitative analysis.
first, two areas of the highest lymphatic vessel density were identified
from each sample. digital imaging of each hotspot was captured with a
polaroid pdmcle digital camera (polaroid, waltham, ma). relative
lymphatic vessel area, which was defined as the percentage of

effects of dexamethasone on vegf-c gene expression and
production by prostate cancer cells. we and others have
previously reported that du145 and pc-3 express  xxxg1601xxx  mrna whereas lncap lacks the glucocorticoid
receptor (10, 11). dexamethasone does not affect proliferation
of these prostate cancer cells when incubated with 2% dextrancoated charcoal-stripped fbs with or without dexamethasone
for 48 hours (11).
the hypothesis of this study was that the therapeutic effect of
dexamethasone on hormone-refractory prostate cancer can be

partly attributed to the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis. to
confirm this, we first analyzed the gene expression and protein
production by dexamethasone-treated prostate cancer cells for
vegf-c. in du145 cells, the statistically significant downregulation of vegf-c mrna expression by 48% (p = 0.003)
and of protein production by 44% (p = 0.002) were observed
in dexamethasone-treated group compared with the control
group. in pc-3 cells, no significant decrease in both vegf-c
mrna expression (p = 0.07) and protein production (p = 0.15)
was seen compared with the control group (fig. 1). the du145
cell line was chosen for subsequent experiments because it
expresses the  xxxg1601xxx  and dexamethasone
exerted an inhibitory effect on vegf-c in these cells. lncap
lacked the  xxxg1601xxx  and expressed extremely low
vegf-c mrna levels (data not shown).
we next examined in du145 cells whether dexamethasone
suppressed vegf-c expression in a concentration-dependent
manner at the mrna and protein levels. du145 cells were
treated with dexamethasone at concentrations of 1 to 1,000
nmol/l for 12 hours for analysis of vegf-c mrna expression

glucocorticoids suppresstumor lymphangiogenesis

fig. 3. time course of the effect of dexamethasone on vegf-c mrna expression
in du145 cells. du145 cells were treated with dexamethasone at concentrations
of 100 nmol/l for 2 to 24 hours for mrna expression analysis.vegf-c mrna
expression was quantified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. columns, mean of
three independent experiments; bars, se. *, p < 0.01, versus the control
(0 hour) group.

and for 24 hours for analysis of protein production in du145
cells. the down-regulation of the vegf-c mrna level
paralleled the inhibition of the protein level in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 2a). as shown in fig. 2b,
dexamethasone did not affect the  xxxg802xxx  mrna expression,
which has also been shown to be associated with tumor
lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in various
neoplasms (22 – 25).
we also examined time course of the effect of dexamethasone
on vegf-c expression. du145 cells were treated with 100
nmol/l dexamethasone for 2 to 24 hours and mrnas were
measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr
(rt-pcr). vegf-c mrna expression was maximally suppressed at 4 hours by 68% (p < 0.001) compared with the
control group (0 hour; fig. 3) and remained significantly
suppressed level beyond 12 hours after the treatment.
we next examined the effects of dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or  xxxd3240xxx  on vegf-c mrna expression
in du145 cells. dexamethasone and hydrocortisone similarly
exerted a significant inhibitory effect on vegf-c mrna
expression, 49% (p < 0.001) and 42% (p < 0.001) compared
with the control group, respectively. by contrast,  xxxd3240xxx  exhibited no inhibitory effect on vegf-c expression (p = 0.22; data not shown).
to examine the effects of dexamethasone on the suppression
of vegf-c expression through the  xxxg1601xxx , we
analyzed whether the  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist ru486
at a concentration of 100 nmol/l reversed the inhibitory effects
of dexamethasone on vegf-c mrna expression. ru486
completely reversed the suppression of vegf-c mrna levels
by dexamethasone in du145 cells. without dexamethasone,
ru486 did not affect the vegf-c expression in du145 cells
(data not shown).
effects of dexamethasone on du145 cells under hypoxia-like
condition. we next assessed whether the effects of  xxxd1853xxx -

asone are also valid under a chemically induced hypoxialike condition using cocl2. du145 cells were treated with
100 nmol/l dexamethasone and/or 100 amol/l cocl2 for
12 hours. even under the hypoxia-like condition, dexamethasone significantly suppressed vegf-c mrna expression by
21% (p < 0.001) compared with the control group. the
hypoxia-like condition itself resulted in a significant downregulation of vegf-c expression regardless of dexamethasone
treatment (p < 0.001; fig. 4).
in vivo effects of dexamethasone on lymphangiogenesis of
du145 xenograft tumors. in the last set of experiments, we
examined whether dexamethasone could inhibit the neolymphangiogenesis of androgen-independent du145 prostate
tumors. the low dose of dexamethasone used in this study, 1 ag
per mouse thrice a week, was based on a previous report
(10, 11) and is widely considered to be clinically beneficial for
patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. we initiated
the treatment f2 weeks after the inoculation when the mean
tumor volume reached 200 to 300 mm3 to confirm the
accomplishments of appropriate inoculation. dexamethasone
significantly reduced tumor growth, which is consistent with
our previous results (11). the mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after
treatment, and we analyzed lymphangiogenesis-related gene
expressions in xenograft tumors to confirm the decrease in
transcription levels of vegf-c in vivo. dexamethasone significantly down-regulated vegf-c mrna expression by 15%
(p = 0.025) compared with the control group, whereas it did
not affect  xxxg802xxx  expression (fig. 5a and b).
we counted lymphatic vessel density in the xenograft
tumors to determine whether in vivo administration of
dexamethasone affects the intratumor neolymphangiogenesis.
lymphatic vessel density identified by podoplanin immunoreactivity in the dexamethasone treatment group was 30
microvessel counts, which was significantly lower (p <
0.001) than that in the control group (41 microvessel counts)
per 200 field (fig. 6a and c). to confirm the result, we also
evaluated relative lymphatic vessel area. as shown in fig. 6b,

human cancer biology

cancer cells become hypoxic because the new blood vessels
that they develop are aberrant and have poor blood flow (26).
importantly, our results revealed that even under hypoxialike conditions, dexamethasone significantly down-regulates
vegf-c expression. interestingly, hypoxia-like condition itself
induced down-regulation of vegf-c in du145 cells as reported
in renal cell carcinoma cells (23). however, the mechanism by
which hypoxia regulates vegf-c gene expression is not well
established. although various lines of evidence have shown
that hypoxia regulates several angiogenic factors via hypoxiainducible factor-1 (27), no hypoxia-inducible factor binding
motif can be found in the published sequence of the vegf-c
promoter region examined to date (28, 29). hypoxia-inducible
factor sequences outside of the vegf-c promoter region or
other non-hypoxia-inducible factor-related mechanisms may
exist (30, 31).
recently,  xxxg1601xxx  – mediated gene regulation
has received considerable attention due to the link between cell
proliferation and angiogenesis (32).  xxxg1601xxx 
activated by glucocorticoids has been shown to interfere with
the transcriptional activity of several transcriptional factors,
such as nuclear factor nb (32, 33) and  xxxg1222xxx 
(32, 34). nuclear factor-nb binding motif can be found in the
published sequence of the vegf-c promoter region (28).
therefore, our results indicate that glucocorticoids exert
inhibitory effect on vegf-c, at least in part, by the  xxxg1601xxx  – mediated suppression of nuclear factor-nb
transcriptional activity.

expression of du145 xenograft tumors. balb/c (nu/nu) mice were each given an
injection in the dorsal area with 1  107 du145 cells. approximately 2 weeks
after the inoculations, the mice were each given a peritumor s.c. injection of 1 ag
dexamethasone (n = 9) or 0.05% ethanol (control; n = 9) thrice a week for
3 weeks. a and b, quantification of vegf-c and  xxxg802xxx  mrna expression in
the du145 xenograft tumors, respectively. mrna was assessed by real-time
quantitative rt-pcr. columns, mean; bars, se. *, p < 0.05, versus the control group.

dexamethasone significantly decreased relative lymphatic
vessel area (3.9% in dexamethasone group versus 8.1% in
the control group, p < 0.001).

discussion
in this study, we have shown that glucocorticoids suppress a
major lymphangiogenic factor, vegf-c, and tumor-associated
lymphangiogenesis in androgen-independent prostate cancer
cells. previous reports have shown that vegf-c expression is
positively correlated with tumor lymphangiogenesis, lymph
node metastasis, and poor prognosis in various neoplasms
including prostate cancer (14 – 18). our results therefore
support the hypothesis that the therapeutic effect of dexamethasone on hormone-refractory prostate cancer can be partly
attributed to the direct inhibition of lymphangiogenesis
through down-regulation of vegf-c. recently, it was shown
that  xxxg802xxx  expression is closely associated with lymph node
metastasis in prostate cancer (24, 25) and that blockade of
 xxxg802xxx  suppresses tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymph node
metastasis in lung cancer (22). interestingly, our results have
shown that dexamethasone does not affect  xxxg802xxx  mrna
expression under current experimental conditions. it is therefore
very possible that the direct inhibition of vegf-c, but not of
 xxxg802xxx , by dexamethasone leads to the reduction of tumor
lymphangiogenesis in androgen-independent prostate cancer.

glucocorticoids suppresstumor lymphangiogenesis

glucocorticoids are not experimental agents but have long
been clinically used in the treatment of numerous diseases
including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and arteriosclerosis (35). low-dose dexamethasone therapy was
found to be beneficial for patients with hormone-refractory
prostate cancer, inducing significant symptomatic improvements and decreasing  xxxg1281xxx  levels with mild
adverse effects (6, 7). in the current study, we observed a
maximal inhibition of vegf-c expression by dexamethasone at
concentrations of 10 to 100 nmol/l achievable in vivo by oral
administration of low doses (1-2 mg/d) of dexamethasone.
therefore, low-dose administration seems to provide more
favorable therapeutic effects rather than high-dose administration for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer,
although prostate cancer is known to consist of a heterogeneous population of cancer cells and may possess clinically
distinct biological features from du145 cells.

glucocorticoids seem to have various effects on hormonerefractory prostate cancer: inhibitions of adrenal production
(8, 9) and tumor cell proliferation (10) and other mechanisms
we have shown [i.e., inhibitions of tumor angiogenesis (11) and
lymphangiogenesis]. recently, we and others have shown that
the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on du145 cell growth
are more evident in vivo than in vitro (10, 11). this result indicates
that the indirect effects by dexamethasone, such as inhibition
of tumor vasculogenesis, are more prominent rather than the
direct inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cell growth in vivo.
in summary, the current study indicates that glucocorticoids
suppress tumor lymphangiogenesis by down-regulation of
vegf-c in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells directly
through the  xxxg1601xxx  pathway. the clinical use of
dexamethasone in combination with antiandrogen, estrogen,
or anticancer agents, such as docetaxel, may enhance the
therapeutic effect on hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
