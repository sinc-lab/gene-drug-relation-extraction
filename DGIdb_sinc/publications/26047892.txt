objective:  xxxd2035xxx  (org 50081), a medication that binds with high aﬃnity to serotonin 5-ht2a and
histamine-1 receptors, was evaluated as a potential treatment for insomnia.
methods: adults with primary insomnia were treated with  xxxd2035xxx  (3.0 or 4.5 mg) or placebo in
this 6-week, double-blind, randomized, polysomnography (psg) study. the end points included wake
time after sleep onset (waso) (primary), latency to persistent sleep, and total sleep time. patientreported parameters were also evaluated, including sleep quality and satisfaction with sleep duration.
residual daytime effects and rebound insomnia (sleep parameters during the single-blind placebo runout week after treatment ended) were also assessed.
results: overall, 419 patients were randomized and 366 (87%) completed treatment. the median decrease in psg waso (double-blind average) was 20.5 min for placebo, and 52.0 min and 53.6 min for
the 3.0- and 4.5-mg  xxxd2035xxx  groups, respectively (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo for both doses). changes
in the other psg parameters and in all patient-reported parameters were also statistically signiﬁcant with
both doses versus placebo. overall, 35–42% of  xxxd2035xxx -treated patients had adverse events (aes)
versus 29% in the placebo group. aes were mild or moderate in most  xxxd2035xxx -treated patients.
furthermore, the incidence of aes leading to discontinuation was low (<8%).
conclusions: six weeks of treatment with  xxxd2035xxx  was associated with consistent improvements
in objective and patient-reported parameters of sleep onset, maintenance, and duration. it was generally well tolerated, and residual daytime effects were minimal and no rebound insomnia was observed.

the neurobiology of the sleep–wake cycle involves the interaction between numerous neurotransmitters and hormones to generate
wakefulness or sleep [1]. gamma– xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) is the
main inhibitory transmitter in the brain and is the system targeted by benzodiazepine receptor agonists (bzras) [2], the current
standard of care for insomnia in the usa. histamine, on the other
hand, plays a key role in promoting wakefulness [1], and several
antihistamines (eg, hydroxyzine, doxepin, and diphenhydramine) are approved in the usa to treat disturbed sleep. like
histamine, serotonin (5-ht) also promotes arousal, and in addition it suppresses rapid eye movement (rem) sleep. it has been
shown that agonists of certain 5-ht receptor subtypes, for example,
5-ht2, increase wakefulness, while antagonists promote sleep
[3–5].
mirtazapine is an antidepressant agent used at doses of 15–45 mg.
it is a racemic mixture of r(−) and s(+) enantiomers, and it acts as
an antagonist at  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors, increasing both noradrenergic
and serotonergic neurotransmission [6,7]. in addition to its

n. ivgy-may et al./sleep medicine 16 (2015) 838–844

antidepressant effects, mirtazapine also has sleep-promoting
properties, both in preclinical models [8] and in healthy volunteers [9], and in patients with depression [10]; these effects are
thought to result from high-aﬃnity binding at 5-ht2 and histamine-1
(h1) receptors (aﬃnity at h1 is approximately six times greater
than that at 5-ht2) [11].  xxxd2035xxx  maleate (org 50081),
which was in development for the treatment of insomnia, is the
 xxxd2536xxx  salt of the s(+) enantiomer of mirtazapine. as
 xxxd2035xxx  has a shorter half-life (10 h) than racemic mirtazapine
and the r(−) enantiomer (18 h for both), it is anticipated
that  xxxd2035xxx  will have a smaller risk for residual sedative
effects the next day. two previous double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled studies have shown that short-term treatment
with 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg of  xxxd2035xxx  signiﬁcantly improved
objective and patient-reported measures of sleep duration,
onset, and maintenance, with higher doses (3.0 and 4.5 mg)
being more effective than the lower dose (1.5 mg) [12,13]. however,
these studies were of short duration (up to two weeks), and
given that insomnia is a chronic condition, longer-term studies
are required. the aim of the current trial was, therefore, to evaluate the eﬃcacy and safety of 3.0 and 4.5 mg of  xxxd2035xxx 
over a longer period (six weeks) in patients with chronic
primary insomnia.

2. materials and methods
2.1. study design and patients
this was a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study conducted between june 2007 and april 2008
in 43 outpatient research clinics in the usa and canada (protocol
number 176002; clinicaltrials.gov id nct00506389). the study
consisted of a screening period (10–14 days), a 6-week doubleblind treatment period, and a 1-week discontinuation period
(supplemental fig. 1). there were two polysomnography (psg) nights
at baseline, three during the double-blind phase (on nights 1, 15,
and 36), and two during the discontinuation period (on the ﬁrst two
nights of the week). during the screening and discontinuation periods,
patients were treated with single-blind placebo.
eligible patients were aged 18–65 years and were diagnosed with
primary insomnia, that is, according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, at least 1 month
before study entry. they also had to fulﬁll the following psg criteria on two screening/baseline psg nights: average total sleep time
(tst) < 6.5 h (and ≥3 and <7 h on both nights), wake time after sleep
onset (waso) ≥ 45 min (and ≥30 min on both nights), and latency
to persistent sleep (lps) ≥ 15 min (and ≥10 min on both nights). the

exclusion criteria were as follows: other sleep or circadian disorders,
current or recent history of depression, substance abuse history, other
conditions potentially causing sleep disturbances, and drugs known
to affect the sleep–wake function (eg, anxiolytics, sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and centrally acting antihistamines).
using an interactive voice-response system, eligible patients were
randomized (1:1:1) to receive  xxxd2035xxx  (3.0 or 4.5 mg) or
placebo once daily for six weeks. study medication was taken in
the evening, approximately 30 min before going to bed.  xxxd2035xxx 
and placebo tablets were identical in appearance, and both patients
and investigators were blinded to treatment assignment during the
6-week treatment period. patients were also blinded to treatment
(placebo) during the screening and discontinuation periods.
all patients provided informed consent to participate in the study,
which was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki
and the international conference on harmonisation guideline for
good clinical practice. the protocol and protocol amendments were
approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional
review board at each study center.
2.2. eﬃcacy endpoints
during the 6-week treatment period, psg was conducted at the
end of days 1, 15 (week 2), and 36 (week 5). patients also completed
an electronic sleep diary each morning during the treatment period.
the primary end point was psg-measured waso, and the key
secondary end point was psg-measured lps (mean at days 1, 15,
and 36). other secondary eﬃcacy end points were as follows: tst,
number of awakenings, waso per quarter of the night, and sleep
architecture (psg-assessed; average of entire 6-week period and
mean at days 1, 15, and 36 for waso per quarter); patient-reported
(subjective) tst (stst), sleep latency (sl), number of awakenings,
waso, sleep quality, and satisfaction with sleep duration (average
of weekly values and over entire 6-week period); and the insomnia severity index (isi) scores and the investigator’s global rating
(igr) (mean at days 15 and 36).
2.3. rebound and withdrawal
rebound was assessed using psg (days 43 and 44) and sleep
diary data (days 43–49) during the run-out period. withdrawal was
assessed using the tyrer benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms
questionnaire (bwsq), completed at baseline, and on days 36 and
50. this is a 20-item questionnaire completed by patients; each
symptom is rated as absent (0), moderate (1), or severe (2), and the
maximum possible score is 40.
2.4. safety and tolerability
safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse
events (aes), physical examinations, vital signs, routine laboratory parameters, and electrocardiograms (ecgs). residual daytime
effects of treatment were assessed in several ways: the bond–
lader rating scale; a morning alertness visual analog scale (vas);
data on daytime functioning, energy levels, and napping (recorded
in an electronic questionnaire completed in the evening); and a
digit symbol substitution test (dsst) on the mornings following
psg assessments.
2.5. statistical methods
all statistical analyses for eﬃcacy were performed on the intentto-treat population, deﬁned as all randomized patients who received
at least one dose of double-blind study medication and underwent at least one post-randomization eﬃcacy assessment. for
outcomes measured on days 1, 15, and 36, missing values were

replaced using the last observation carried forward method. for outcomes measured as averages over one or six weeks, data from
observed cases were used. safety analyses were conducted using
data from all patients who received at least one dose of doubleblind study medication.
from previous studies of other insomnia treatments, the standard deviation (sd) for psg waso was expected to be approximately
45 min. based on this, it was estimated that 130 patients per group
would be required to achieve a power of 90% to detect a clinically
relevant difference of 20 min between  xxxd2035xxx  and placebo
at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05.
for the primary end point (waso) and key secondary end point
(lps), two statistical tests were conducted to compare  xxxd2035xxx 
and placebo, using the analysis of covariance (ancova) model on
ranked data with treatment and center as ﬁxed effects and (ranktransformed) baseline values as covariates. to control for the type i
family-wise error rate in this multiple comparison situation, a ﬁxed
sequence procedure (wherein the hypotheses were ordered in a ﬁxed
sequence) was used for the primary end point (waso) with an
overall signiﬁcance level of 0.05 for a two-tailed test; testing started
with the high dose of 4.5 mg. a ﬁxed sequence procedure was also
used for the key secondary end point (lps), provided that the primary
end-point analysis was statistically signiﬁcant. the other eﬃcacy
parameters were also analyzed using ancova, but no adjustments were made for multiplicity.
3. results
3.1. patients
overall, 1197 patients were screened, 419 patients were
randomized, and 366 (87%) completed the study (fig. 1).
data from one of the sites (n = 15) were not included in the
eﬃcacy analysis due to concerns about the eligibility of patients;
based on audit ﬁndings, concerns were raised about the credibility
of the data. however, data from this site were included in the routine
safety analysis. overall, the treatment groups were well balanced
with respect to baseline demography and clinical characteristics,
although there were slightly fewer white patients in the 3.0-mg
 xxxd2035xxx  group (table 1).
3.2. objective (psg) measures of sleep eﬃcacy
there were statistically signiﬁcant improvements in waso
(primary end point) in both  xxxd2035xxx  groups versus placebo
at days 1, 15, and 36, and for the double-blind period average
(p < 0.0001 for both doses at all time points) (fig. 2). in addition,
both  xxxd2035xxx  doses signiﬁcantly improved waso in all four
quarters of the night; the difference from placebo was statistically
signiﬁcant at all time points (days 1, 15, and 36) and for the doubleblind period average (p < 0.02).
there were also statistically signiﬁcant improvements in lps, the
key secondary end point, in both  xxxd2035xxx  groups versus
placebo at all time points and for the double-blind average (p < 0.006
for both doses at all time points) (fig. 2).
compared with placebo, there were also statistically signiﬁcant improvements in the average values for tst (both  xxxd2035xxx 
doses; p < 0.0001) and the number of awakenings (3.0 mg of
 xxxd2035xxx ; p = 0.03) during the double-blind period (table 2).
there was also an increase in the total time in sws (stages 3 and
4) (p < 0.05 for both  xxxd2035xxx  doses) and stage 2 sleep
(p < 0.0001 for both  xxxd2035xxx  doses), but no evidence of a differential effect of the two  xxxd2035xxx  doses (table 2). there were
no statistically signiﬁcant between-group differences for stage 1
sleep, total rem time, or rem latency (table 2).

improved with both doses of  xxxd2035xxx  relative to placebo during
each week of the double-blind treatment.
the differences between both doses of  xxxd2035xxx  and placebo
were statistically signiﬁcant for the improvement in isi from baseline and for the igr-change score (table 2).
3.4. rebound and withdrawal
on days 43 and 44, the median values for psg waso were signiﬁcantly better relative to baseline in all treatment groups (fig. 3).
the same was also true for the median values for psg tst and lps
(p < 0.0001 vs. placebo). for psg waso and tst, the differences
between  xxxd2035xxx  and placebo were statistically signiﬁcant for
both parameters at day 43 for the 4.5-mg group and at day 44 for
the 3.0-mg group (p ≤ 0.02), with  xxxd2035xxx  showing greater
continued eﬃcacy.
for the patient-reported sleep parameters, there were statistically signiﬁcant improvements relative to baseline in waso, sl, and
stst in all treatment groups on each day of the 7-day discontinuation period. furthermore, the difference in stst between the placebo
and both  xxxd2035xxx  groups was statistically superior on most
nights (p < 0.04).
there was no evidence of withdrawal symptoms; bwsq scores
at day 50 in all treatment groups were not signiﬁcantly different
from baseline.
3.5. residual daytime effects
compared with baseline, all treatment groups showed
improvements in the scores for dsst (representing a learning effect),
morning alertness vas, and the bond–lader rating scale. there were
no statistically signiﬁcant differences for  xxxd2035xxx  versus
placebo for any of the parameters on days 2, 16, and 37, with the
exception of the dsst score for 3.0 mg of  xxxd2035xxx  on day 2,
when the increase was signiﬁcantly less than placebo (table 3).
there were also differences from baseline in all treatment groups
in energy levels and ability to work/function during the doubleblind treatment groups. for those who indicated that they had
napped during the day, the mean (sd) duration of naps was
71.7 (41.8) min and 66.6 (48.4) min in the 3.0- and 4.5-mg
 xxxd2035xxx  groups, respectively, and 50.5 (36.8) min in the placebo
group (double-blind average values).

3.6. safety and tolerability
the overall safety proﬁle of  xxxd2035xxx  is shown in table 4.
the overall incidences of aes, drug-related aes, and aes leading to
discontinuation were higher in the  xxxd2035xxx  groups than in
the placebo group. in those who experienced aes in the
 xxxd2035xxx  groups, the majority (>95%) were mild or moderate
in intensity. in addition, the overall rate of discontinuation was low
(<8%). one patient in the 4.5-mg  xxxd2035xxx  group experienced three serious aes (neutropenia, sepsis, and streptococcal
pneumonia). the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics
and recovered. there were no deaths during the study.
the most commonly reported aes were somnolence and headache, and the most common ae leading to discontinuation was
somnolence (two patients in the 3.0-mg group and three patients

placebo. the numbers (%) of patients with an increase in body weight
≥7% were one (0.7%), six (4.9%), and one (0.7%), respectively.

physical examination, vital signs, biochemistry, or ecg.

4. discussion
in the current study,  xxxd2035xxx  at doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg
were associated with consistent and sustained improvements in sleep
in adults with primary insomnia. compared with placebo, there were
signiﬁcant improvements in all sleep parameters (onset, maintenance, and duration) assessed both objectively (psg) and by patients.
there were modest increases in the duration of slow-wave and stage 2
sleep relative to placebo, but otherwise sleep architecture (stage-1
sleep, total rem time, and rem latency) was generally preserved.
sl was reduced (relative to placebo) by ~15–22 min (psg) and by
~10 min (patient-reported), and tst was increased by 44–50 min
(psg) and 32–35 min (patient-reported). the continuity of the effect
of  xxxd2035xxx  on sleep maintenance was also demonstrated by
the signiﬁcant decrease versus placebo in psg-measured waso
during each quarter of the night – this is an important ﬁnding given
the burden associated with sleep maintenance insomnia [14] and
the unmet need for treatments that promote sleep maintenance
without inducing signiﬁcant next-day sedation [15]. observed changes
in sleep parameters were paralleled by signiﬁcant improvements
in patient-reported quality of sleep and satisfaction with sleep
duration. there was no evidence of tolerance to the effects of
 xxxd2035xxx  as shown by the statistically signiﬁcant reductions
in sl, waso, sleep quality, and satisfaction with sleep duration during
each of the six weeks of the study. indeed, psg sleep parameters
continued to improve compared with baseline after treatment
discontinuation, and the difference from placebo was statistically
signiﬁcant for stst. this appears to be the ﬁrst time such a result
has been found in patients with primary insomnia, although a sustained beneﬁt after treatment discontinuation was reported in
patients with depression and comorbid insomnia treated with
ﬂuoxetine and eszoplicone [16].
 xxxd2035xxx  was associated with minimal residual daytime
effects as measured by dsst, morning alertness vas scores, and bond–
lader rating scale scores, despite the reports of somnolence in some
patients (see below). this may be due to the release of other wakepromoting neurotransmitters [17] or the circadian and arousal
variations in histamine release [18], although further research would
be required to evaluate this. previous studies of  xxxd2035xxx 
have also evaluated the potential for residual effects of treatment.
in the 2-week placebo-controlled study of 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg of
 xxxd2035xxx  in patients with chronic primary insomnia, changes
in all measures of the residual effect were similar in the  xxxd2035xxx 
and placebo groups [13]. in another study, which assessed the residual effects of  xxxd2035xxx  in healthy volunteers by evaluating
actual driving performance, single doses of 4.5 mg were associated
with residual daytime impairment, but this generally resolved after
repeated administration [19]. indeed, in an earlier randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ﬁnding study with
 xxxd2035xxx , there were reductions in daytime “energy” and “ability
to work/function” with all doses (1.5, 3, and 4.5 mg) relative to placebo
after the ﬁrst but not the second night of treatment [20].
the current standard of care for treating insomnia in the usa
includes bzras; this class consists of benzodiazepines (eg,
temazepam) and non-benzodiazepines (the “z-drugs,” zolpidem,
 xxxd2047xxx , and zaleplon). it is diﬃcult to compare the eﬃcacy of
 xxxd2035xxx  with that of the bzras because of differences in study
design and duration, but in a psg study in which adults with primary
insomnia were treated with  xxxd2047xxx  or placebo for six weeks,
sl and waso changes relative to placebo were ~19 min and ~7 min

843

for 3 mg of  xxxd2047xxx  [21,22]. comparisons of data from separate studies should, of course, be interpreted with caution.
comparison of the effects of  xxxd2035xxx  with that of another
potent h1 antagonist, doxepin, suggests some notable differences
between these agents. in a similar psg study in adults treated with
3 and 6 mg of doxepin, there were beneﬁcial effects on waso during
every portion of the night and on tst, as observed with
 xxxd2035xxx  [23]. however, unlike  xxxd2035xxx , doxepin did not
have a robust therapeutic effect on sleep onset or number of awakenings. these differences may reﬂect either a greater degree of h1
or 5-ht2 antagonism with  xxxd2035xxx  versus doxepin. clinically,
the data suggest that patients with sleep-onset diﬃculties would
be more likely to beneﬁt from  xxxd2035xxx  than from 3 or 6 mg
of doxepin, although further studies would be required to conﬁrm
this and to evaluate possible reasons for any differences.
 xxxd2035xxx  was generally well tolerated in the current study.
most aes were mild or moderate in intensity. somnolence was the
most common ae overall, affecting ~12% of  xxxd2035xxx -treated
patients. it was also the most common ae leading to discontinuation, but this affected <2% of patients. furthermore, as discussed
previously, it had no consistent effect on morning alertness, daytime
functioning, the bond–lader rating scale, or dsst, all of which are
sensitive to somnolence-induced changes in performance.
as reported in a previous, 2-week, placebo-controlled study [13],
there were small mean increases in body weight in esmirtazapinettreated patients; this may reﬂect blockade of h1 and/or 5-ht2c
receptors, the purported mechanism of mirtazapine-induced weight
gain [24,25]. the proportion of patients with ≥7% weight gain
(deﬁned by the food and drug administration (fda) as clinically
signiﬁcant) was the same in the 3.0-mg  xxxd2035xxx  and placebo
groups (0.7%) and 4.9% in the 4.5-mg  xxxd2035xxx  group. further
studies would be required to evaluate the longer-term effects of
 xxxd2035xxx  on body weight, as well as its eﬃcacy and safety in
elderly patients and in patients with insomnia and comorbid conditions such as depression.
there was no consistent differential eﬃcacy beneﬁt with the
higher  xxxd2035xxx  dose in the current study. similarly, there was
no consistent difference in the safety or ae proﬁles between the two
doses, although the degree of clinically signiﬁcant weight gain may
be higher with 4.5 mg of  xxxd2035xxx . it should be noted, however,
that the current study was not speciﬁcally designed to compare the
eﬃcacy and safety of the two  xxxd2035xxx  doses; further studies
would be required to evaluate this in more detail. another limitation of the current study is its short duration – further studies would
be required to determine its eﬃcacy and safety beyond six weeks.
the strengths of the study include the relatively large number of
patients enrolled, the rigorous design, and the selection of a patient
population that is generally representative of those with insomnia, increasing the generalizability of the results.
in conclusion, the current study shows that  xxxd2035xxx  was
effective for treating all nocturnal insomnia symptoms in adults. this
is in line with its known mechanism of high-aﬃnity binding at
5-ht2a and h1 receptors. this approach involves inhibiting the wakefulness system rather than the gabaergic approach, which stimulates
the sleep system.
