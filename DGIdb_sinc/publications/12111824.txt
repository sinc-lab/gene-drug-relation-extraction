the properties of a transport system specific for
␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) expressed in human u373
mg astrocytoma cells were examined. the uptake of
[3h]gaba was dependent on both extracellular na⫹ and
cl– ions and was inhibited by (⫾)-nipecotic acid,  xxxd2248xxx , and ␤-alanine, with a pharmacological profile
corresponding to that reported for the human homologue
of the gaba/betaine transporter ( xxxg2145xxx ). accordingly,
[3h]gaba uptake was also inhibited by betaine, and
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) analysis of total rna from u373 mg cells with
specific  xxxg2145xxx  primers resulted in the amplification of a
440 bp fragment that was further characterized by restriction analysis and sequencing. in addition, western
blot analysis with anti- xxxg2145xxx  antiserum revealed the
presence of a characteristic 60 kda band. the primary
structure of the human  xxxg2145xxx  protein predicts two putative phosphorylation sites for the ca2⫹/diacylgliceroldependent protein kinase (pkc), and treatment of u373
mg cells with the pkc activator phorbol 12-myristate13-acetate (tpa) led to a concentration- and timedependent decrease in [3h]gaba uptake. the maximal
effect was detected at 2 hr of incubation, to disappear
after 4 hr. tpa-induced reduction in [3h]gaba uptake
was reversed by preincubation with  xxxd3241xxx . taken
together, these results indicate that u373 mg cells express a gaba transporter of the  xxxg2145xxx  subtype whose
function is regulated by phosphorylation events through
pkc. © 2002 wiley-liss, inc.

40% of the synapses in the mammalian brain (iversen and
kelly, 1975). gabaergic synaptic transmission is mediated by two classes of gaba receptors; the most prevalent, termed gabaa, is a multisubunit protein containing
an intrinsic ligand-gated chloride channel in addition to
binding sites for a variety of neuroactive drugs, including
benzodiazepines and barbiturates (krnjevic et al., 1991). in
contrast, gabab receptors couple to g-proteins and
thereby modulate k⫹ and ca2⫹ channels (barnard et al.,
1998). as for most neurotransmitters, gabaergic transmission is terminated by the rapid uptake of gaba via
specific, sodium- and chloride-dependent transporters located on the presynaptic terminal and/or surrounding glial
cells (nelson, 1998). several members of a family of
gaba transporters have been cloned, namely,  xxxg2143xxx 
(guastella et al., 1990),  xxxg2146xxx , and  xxxg2144xxx  (borden et
al., 1992), all three from rat brain libraries. an additional
and unanticipated member of this class is a transporter
cloned from madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells
(yamauchi et al., 1992). this protein was shown to transport betaine, an important osmolyte in the kidney, as well
as gaba. accordingly, it was termed  xxxg2145xxx  (for
betaine/gaba transporter). interestingly, low concentrations of betaine have been detected in brain, which increase upon salt loading. therefore, an osmoregulatory
function for this molecule has been suggested (heiling et
al., 1989).

the human homologue of  xxxg2145xxx  has been cloned
from a brain cdna library and found to be widely distributed throughout the brain, although its localization
does not match that of gabaergic pathways (borden et
al., 1995). this lack of correspondence suggests that
 xxxg2145xxx  might not play a role in terminating the action of
gaba at the synapse; rather, it may serve to sequester
gaba that has diffused away from the synaptic regions,
thereby ensuring the fidelity of transmission. interestingly,
in the primary structure of human  xxxg2145xxx , two putative
phosphorylation sites for protein kinase c (pkc) are
present. whether these are genuine phosphorylation sites
is not known at this time.
inhibition of gaba uptake provides an interesting
approach to enhance inhibitory gabaergic transmission
in the central nervous system. several studies in human
brain have shown that in epileptic hippocampi gaba
transporter function is reduced (schousboe et al., 1983),
an effect that may result from reversed gaba transport
resulting from membrane depolarization. this action reduces the risk of hyperactive glutamatergic neurons that,
when they overcome a certain threshold, originate seizures. therefore, there is much interest in identifying
agents that block gaba uptake. these agents may be used
as anticonvulsive drugs by acting as selective inhibitors of
either glial or neuronal uptake.
the objective of the present work was the pharmacological and molecular characterization of the gaba
transporter expressed in u373 mg human astrocytoma
cells. because putative phosphorylation sites for pkc have
been identified in the cloned  xxxg2145xxx  transporter, we also
set out to investigate whether gaba uptake was modulated by the pkc activator phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx -13acetate (tpa).
materials and methods
chemicals
[3h]gaba (specific activity 81 ci/mmol) was obtained
from amersham pharmacia biotech (arington heights, il).
tissue culture reagents were from gibco-brl (grand island,
ny). plasticware was purchased from costar (cambridge, ma).
gaba,  xxxd2248xxx , tpa, and  xxxd3241xxx  (sta) were from
tocris. (⫾)-nipecotic acid and ␤-alanine were purchased from
rbi (nattick, ma). all other chemicals were from sigma
(st. louis, mo).
cell culture
u373 mg cells (national culture collection), were
plated at a density of 0.5 ⫻ 106 cells/ml in 6- or 24-well plates
in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem)/nutrient
mixture f12 (1:1 v/v; gibco-brl) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% antibiotics (0.01 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 u/ml
penicillin). cells were grown as monolayers at 37°c in a co2
incubator (5% co2).
[3h]gaba uptake assay
for the analysis of [3h]gaba uptake, the culture medium
was replaced by hepes-buffered krebs (kh) medium (in mm:

hepes 20, nacl 130, kcl 3.7, cacl2 1.8,  xxxd2534xxx  1.18,
glucose 11, k2hpo4 1.8, ph 7.4, with  xxxd3449xxx ), and the cells
were preincubated at 37°c. after 30 min, cells were washed
twice with warmed kh medium and then incubated in kh
medium containing [3h]gaba or [3h]gaba/gaba for
20 min at 37°c, except for time course experiments. thereafter,
the medium was removed by rapid aspiration, and the monolayers were washed with ice-cold medium and solubilized with
0.1 m naoh. aliquots of the suspension were used for protein
determination (bradford, 1987) and liquid scintillation counting.
for experiments on the na⫹ dependence of gaba uptake, licl was equimolarly substituted for nacl. to test the
dependence on extracellular cl– ions, acetate salts were equimolarly substituted for chloride salts. special care was taken to
preserve an equal osmolarity in the different solutions.
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
for rt-pcr, reverse transcription was performed as
previously reported (lópez et al., 1997).  xxxg2145xxx  oligonucleotide
primers map nt 1,820 –1,840 (upper) and 2,240 –2,260 (lower)
of the human betaine transporter (borden et al., 1995). total
rna was isolated from cell monolayers as described by chomczynski and sacchi (1987). first, the cdna strand was synthesized using 2 ␮g of total rna, 200 u of mmlv-reverse
transcriptase, and 40 pmol oligo-(dt) as primer. the oligonucloetides used were as follows:  xxxg2145xxx  sense 5⬘catcctcaccatcgccgtcat-3⬘,  xxxg2145xxx  antisense 5⬘acgcagacgcttcctgaaagg-3⬘;  xxxg2143xxx  sense 5⬘acg ctt cga ctt cct cat gtc ctg t-3⬘,  xxxg2143xxx

after 30 cycles, the density of the amplified band was
linear, with the amount of starting rna as shown by scanning
of the ethidium bromide staining of the electrophoresed pcr
products. sequence analysis was carried out with the big-dye
terminator kit (perkin elmer applied biosystems prism, norwalk, ct) and a genetic analyzer (310 abi prism).
sds-page and western blot
cells were harvested and washed three times with
phosphate-buffered saline solution (pbs; in mm: k2hpo4/
kh2po4 10, nacl 150, ph 7.4). cells were then lysed in
50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, containing protease inhibitors
(0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and
1 mg/ml leupeptin). an aliquot was used for protein determination, and lysates were boiled for 5 min in laemmli’s sample
buffer. equal amounts of protein (⬃70 ␮g) were resolved in
10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. the uniform transfer of
proteins to the nitrocellulose membrane was routinely monitored by transiently staining the membranes with ponceau s
stain. after transfer, the membranes were washed with pbs and
incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with 5% (w/v) skimmed
milk powder and 0.1% tween-20 in pbs, to block the excess of

 xxxg2145xxx  expressed in human astrocytoma u373 mg cells

nonspecific protein binding sites. blots were then incubated for
12 hr at 4°c with the primary antibody (polyclonal anti- xxxg2145xxx ;
chemicon, temecula, ca) diluted in pbs containing 5% (w/v)
skimmed milk powder and 0.1% tween-20. primary antibodies
were removed, and the blot was extensively washed with pbs/
0.1% tween-20. blots were then incubated for 1 hr at 37°c

127

with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit igg coupled to
horseradish peroxidase; bio-rad, hercules, ca) at 1:3,000 dilution in 5% skimmed milk powder dissolved in pbs/0.1%
tween-20. after removal of the secondary antibody, blots were
washed as described above and developed using the enhanced
chemiluminiscence detection system (amersham).
data analysis
all data are expressed as mean ⫾ sem. concentrationresponse curves were fitted by nonlinear regression to a hyperbola or to a logistic (hill) equation using the program prism
(graphpad software). statistical significance was determined by
student’s t-test or anova, followed by dunnett’s test as
appropriate.

results
[3h]gaba uptake in u373 mg cells
experimental conditions were first established for
measuring accurately the kinetics of [3h]gaba transport
in u373 mg cells. the uptake of [3h]gaba (50 nm) was
linear up to 30 min, the maximal period examined (data
not shown). therefore, in all subsequent experiments, incubations were set at 20 min. [3h]gaba uptake showed
a marked dependence on the extracellular concentration
of both na⫹ and cl– ions as shown in figure 1a. halfmaximal [3h]gaba uptake was observed at 64 ⫾ 4 mm
na⫹ ([cl–] maintained at 140 mm) or 97 ⫾ 3 mm cl–
([na⫹] maintained at 131 mm).
gaba uptake in response to increasing concentrations of [3h]gaba/gaba is shown in figure 1b. the
kinetic parameters of gaba transport determined by nonlinear regression analysis yielded a maximal velocity
(vmax) of 750 ⫾ 10 fmol/mg protein/min and a km of
299 ⫾ 7 ␮m (fig. 1b).

three blockers of gaba uptake [ xxxd2248xxx ,
␤-alanine and (⫾)-nipecotic acid] were tested for inhibition of [3h]gaba transport by u373 mg cells. in addition, the effect of betaine was also determined. all four
compounds inhibited the uptake of 50 nm [3h]gaba in
a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 1c). for all inhibition curves, there was no significant improvement in
the fit when the data were fitted to a two-site rather than
to a one-site model (nonlinear regression with prism;
graphpad software). best-fit estimates for ic50 values are
given in table i and compared with literature values for
the inhibition of cloned gaba transporters (borden et al.,
1992, 1995; borden, 1996).
molecular characterization of the gaba
transporter expressed in u373 mg cells
to characterize further the gaba transporter expressed by u373 mg cells, a pcr strategy was used. for
this purpose, we synthesized a set of primers mapping nt
1,820 –1,840 (upper) and 2,240 –2,260 (lower) that amplify a 440 bp fragment of the human  xxxg2145xxx  (borden et
al., 1995). when total rna isolated from u373 mg cells
was analyzed by rt-pcr with these primers, a sharp
band of the predicted size was obtained (fig. 2a, lane 2).
to rule out the possibility that under our experimental
conditions dna was present in the rna preparations,
and could thus serve as template in pcr, we used our
rna preparations directly in the pcr and, as expected,
no amplification was obtained (fig. 2a, lane 1).
the identity of the pcr fragment was determined
by restriction analysis with bglii (fig. 2a, lane 3) and
sequence analysis. restriction analysis resulted in the appearance of two overlapping 220 bp bands, and a 100%
homology was found when the sequence was compared
with the corresponding fragments of the  xxxg2145xxx  and
aslc6a12 sequences of the human genome as well as
with the corresponding fragment of the sequence of the
human kidney/brain  xxxg2145xxx  transporter (fig. 3). the
possibility that other gaba transporters could be participating in gaba uptake by u373 mg cells was examined
by rt-pcr experiments with specific  xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx ,

and  xxxg2144xxx  primers (guastella et al., 1990). with rat brain
cdna, these primers amplify the expected products; in
contrast, when u3273 mg cdna was used in the pcr,
no product could be detected (data not shown). these
results suggest that the [3h]gaba uptake activity in u373
mg cells is carried exclusively by  xxxg2145xxx . furthermore,
western blot analysis with anti- xxxg2145xxx  antibodies resulted
in the identification of an immunopositive polypeptide
migrating at approximately 60 kda (fig. 2b). note that
lysates from human epithelial lung cells (a 549) did not
express  xxxg2145xxx  (negative control), whereas a strong
immunopositive band was detected in mdck cells
(positive control), from which  xxxg2145xxx  was first cloned
(fig. 2b).
tpa-induced inhibition of [3h]gaba transport
to explore the role of the putative pkc phosphorylation sites of  xxxg2145xxx , we performed [3h]gaba uptake
experiments in u373 mg cells preexposed to tpa. figure
4a shows that tpa reduced [3h]gaba uptake in a
concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal inhibition of 35% ⫾ 2% for this series experiments and a
half-maximal effect at 27 nm. therefore, 100 nm tpa
was used in subsequent experiments.
the time course of the tpa effect is depicted in
figure 4b. a 30 min exposure to tpa is sufficient to
reduce markedly [3h]gaba uptake, although the maximal effect takes place at 2 hr, returning to control levels
after 4 hr. preincubation with the  xxxg1377xxx 
inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx  (500 nm) reversed the effect of
100 nm tpa (fig. 4c).
the kinetic constants of the transporter under a
30 min exposure to tpa were determined (fig. 5). there
was no significant change in km (328 ⫾ 37 and 325 ⫾
31 ␮m for tpa-treated and control cells respectively, n ⫽
3; p ⬎ 0.05), but vmax was reduced by 66% ⫾ 1% (p ⬍
0.05) in this series of experiments. these results strongly
suggest that phosphorylation events might play a role in
 xxxg2145xxx  activity modulation.

discussion
the results presented herein demonstrate the expression by human astrocytoma u373 mg cells of a functional
gaba transporter with the molecular and pharmacological characteristics of the human  xxxg2145xxx  transporter. this
transporter might be involved volume regulation within
the cns, taking into consideration that brain betain levels
rise after salt loading (heiling et al., 1989). in fact, a 61%
sequence identity of  xxxg2145xxx  with the taurine transporter
has been reported (smith et al., 1992). our results also
show that gaba uptake by u373 mg cells is regulated by
pkc activation. as with astrocytes, u373 mg cells express  xxxg883xxx  (gfap) and can be
induced to secrete a number of cytokines, including in-

(noe et al., 1999).
molecular cloning has revealed the existence of
genes for four distinct gaba transporters,  xxxg2143xxx ,
 xxxg2146xxx ,  xxxg2144xxx , and  xxxg2145xxx , that can also be differentiated by their pharmacological properties. gaba uptake
by u373 mg cells depends on the presence of both na⫹
and cl– ions in the extracellular medium, and its kinetic
parameters are similar to those reported for  xxxg2145xxx  (yamauchi et al., 1992; borden et al., 1995; matskevitch et al.,
1999). although the gaba transporter identified in u373
mg cells shows a relatively low affinity for gaba (km
⬃300 ␮m), compared with the reported 42 ␮m when

130

ruiz-tachiquı́n et al.

human  xxxg2145xxx  is expressed in cos-7 cells (borden et al.,
1995), this probably is due to differential protein–protein
interactions present in these cells. in any event, this low
affinity is significantly different from the affinity value
reported for all other three gaba transporters (10 –30 ␮m;

borden, 1996), favoring the involvement of this transporter in other physiological functions, such as volume
regulation.
the inhibition of [3h]gaba uptake by three different blockers was analyzed in the presence of a concentration of the radiolabeled neurotransmitter (50 nm) that
allowed a direct comparison with values reported previously (borden et al., 1992; borden, 1996). the pattern of
inhibition of [3h]gaba uptake and results of rt-pcr
experiments gave no indication of the presence of more
than one transporter, and the inhibition profile resembles
that of the cloned  xxxg2145xxx  transporter, rather than those
corresponding to  xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx , or  xxxg2144xxx  (table i). in
particular, the gaba transporter expressed by u373 mg
cells shows very low affinity for  xxxd2248xxx , ␤-alanine, and
(⫾)-nipecotic acid, with ic50 values in the millimolar
range that agree well with those reported for  xxxg2145xxx . in
contrast, other cloned gaba transporters show high
( xxxg2143xxx ) or moderate ( xxxg2146xxx ,  xxxg2144xxx ) affinity for (⫾)nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  and high affinity for ␤-alanine
( xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx ). the concentration of [3h]gaba
present in these experiments (50 nm) is well below the
km, so the estimated ic50 values should approximate the
inhibition constant (ki). the  xxxg2145xxx  transporter cloned
from mdck cells has been shown to transport betaine
(yamauchi et al., 1992), and our results show that gaba
transport by u373 cells is also inhibited by this drug,
although with an ic50 value in the low millimolar range,
in accordance with the value of 934 ⫾ 22 ␮m reported by
borden et al. (1995).
the molecular identity of the transporter was established using two approaches, rt-pcr and western blot,
with both techniques resulting in the identification of the
expected products. on the one hand, restriction analysis
with bglii resulted in the appearance of two overlapping
220 bp bands. on the other hand, when total cell lysates
were exposed to anti-rat  xxxg2145xxx  antibodies, a band of the
expected size (⬃60 kda) was revealed. it is worth mentioning that both strategies were complementary in view
of the fact that no antibodies have been developed against

found between the sequence of the pcr product and the
corresponding fragments of the human  xxxg2145xxx  sequences
confirms that u373 mg cells express this subtype of
gaba transporter. finally, rt-pcr analysis with specific  xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx , and  xxxg2144xxx  primers, which amplify
the expected products with rat brain cdna, showed no
evidence for the expression of such proteins, indicating
that gaba uptake by u373 mg cells is due solely to a
 xxxg2145xxx  transporter.
neurotransmitter transporters exhibit a number of
functional properties that enable them to influence neurotransmitter levels. for example, preincubation with different substrate concentrations modifies the transporter
activity (bernstein and quick, 1999). in addition, transporters can operate in reversed manner, the nonvesicular
efflux of transmitter being an important source for increased extracellular transmitter levels. in fact, this process
has been proposed to play a major role in a number of
pathophysiological conditions (attwell et al., 1993).
our present knowledge of the role of protein phosphorylation in gaba transport is restricted, and the signal
transduction mechanisms underlying these regulatory actions remain largely unexplored. gomeza et al. (1991)
have demonstrated an inhibition of gaba uptake in rat
primary astrocytes cultures under tpa exposure. a pkcdependent inhibition in betaine uptake activity in mdck
cells has also been reported (preston et al., 1995). more
recent studies have shown that pkc modulates the activity
of  xxxg2143xxx  via the regulation of the subcellular distribution

of the transporter, rather than by pkc-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter (corey et al., 1994; quick
et al., 1997; horton and quick, 2001). the redistribution
between different intracellular locations and the plasma
membrane has proved to be a common regulatory mechanism in several neurotransmitter transporters (deken et
al., 2001). the best characterized trigger for this mechanism is pkc, which is postulated to exert its action
through pick1 (protein interacting with the c kinase), a
novel protein involved in protein–protein interactions
with clustering molecules such as syntaxin 1a (deken et
al., 2000; torres et al., 2001).
as concerns brain  xxxg2145xxx , no information is available about its possible regulation by pkc. therefore, we
decided to examine the effect of tpa on the bgt-1mediated [3h]gaba uptake activity in u373 mg cells.
tpa induced a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in [3h]gaba uptake (fig. 2a,b), making conceivable the hypothesis of the physiological regulation of the
transport process. the sensitivity of this effect to  xxxd3241xxx  (fig. 2c) supported the involvement of pkc. the
analysis of the kinetic parameters in tpa-treated cells
showed no effect on the affinity for gaba, but a marked
decrease in the capacity of transport, favoring the idea that
tpa treatment results in a pick-mediated reduction of
membrane-associated  xxxg2145xxx  transporters.
in conclusion, u373 mg astrocytoma cells express
the  xxxg2145xxx  subtype of na⫹/cl–-dependent gaba transporter, whose acivity can be modulated by pkc stimulation. experiments currently underway in our laboratory
are aimed at establishing the molecular mechanisms of
such a regulation.
