the abbreviations used are: pghss, prostaglandin endoperoxide h

the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  (aa) to prostaglandin h2
(pgh2) (1–3). this is the committed step in the biosynthesis of
prostaglandins and thromboxanes. these compounds are local
hormones that act at or near their sites of synthesis to coordinate intercellular responses evoked by circulating hormones
and perhaps intracellular events associated with cell replication and differentiation (3). there are two pghs isozymes
designated  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  (or  xxxg1883xxx  and -2
(cox-1 and -2)).  xxxg1883xxx  and -2 are often referred to as the
constitutive and inducible forms of the enzyme, respectively.
 xxxg1883xxx  and -2 are closely related structurally (4 –7) and
mechanistically (2, 3, 8) although there are some subtle kinetic
differences between the two isoforms with respect to hydroperoxide activator requirements (9 –11) and substrate (12, 13) and
inhibitor (14, 15) specificities. both pghs isozymes catalyze
two different reactions as follows: a cyclooxygenase reaction in
which aa is converted to an intermediate prostaglandin endoperoxide pgg2, and a peroxidase reaction in which the 15hydroperoxyl group of pgg2 is reduced to an alcohol yielding
pgh2 (1–3). although the peroxidase activity can function independently of the cyclooxygenase activity (16), activation of
the cyclooxygenase requires a functional peroxidase (2, 3, 11).
x-ray crystallographic studies indicate that the cyclooxygenase reaction occurs in a hydrophobic channel that extends
from the membrane binding domain of the enzyme into the core
of the globular domain (7). the fatty acid substrate is positioned in this site in an extended l-shaped conformation (7).
cyclooxygenase catalysis begins with abstraction of the 13-pros-hydrogen from aa in the rate determining step to generate
an aa radical (17, 18). a tyrosyl radical positioned on tyr-3852
abstracts this hydrogen from the substrate fatty acid (2, 3, 18,
19). the tyrosyl radical is formed as a result of oxidation of the
heme group at the peroxidase site of the enzyme (2, 3, 8).
most studies of the cyclooxygenase activities of  xxxg1883xxx  and
-2 have utilized aa as the substrate. although aa is the preferred substrate, both enzymes will oxygenate n-3 and n-6 c18,
c20, and c22  xxxd2154xxx  in vitro with catalytic efficiencies in the
range of 0.05– 0.7 to that of aa (12). at least some of these
alternative substrates including 9,12-octadecadienoate (linolesynthases; pg, prostaglandin; aa,  xxxd208xxx ;  xxxd1887xxx , dihomo-␥ xxxd2490xxx ; hpghs-2, human  xxxg1884xxx ; opghs-1, ovine  xxxg1883xxx ;
11-hete, 11-hydroxy(5z,8z,12e,14z)-eicosatetraenoic acid; 11hpete, 11-hydroperoxy(5z,8z,12e,14z)-eicosatetraenoic acid; 15hete, 15-hydroxy(5z,8z,11z,13e)-eicosatetraenoic acid; 15-hpete,
15-hydroperoxy(5z,8z,11z,13e)-eicosatetraenoic acid; hetres, 11and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acids; r.m.s., root mean square.

the numbering of residues in opghs-1 is based on numbering the
n-terminal methionine of the signal peptide as residue number 1 (56),
and the homologous numbering system is used for human  xxxg1884xxx  (5,
6).

prostaglandin endoperoxide h synthases-1 and -2
(pghss) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin
biosynthesis. both isozymes can oxygenate a variety of
related polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . we report here the
x-ray crystal structure of dihomo-␥- xxxd2490xxx 
( xxxd1887xxx ) in the cyclooxygenase site of  xxxg1883xxx  and the
effects of active site substitutions on the oxygenation of
 xxxd1887xxx , and we compare these results to those obtained
previously with  xxxd208xxx  (aa).  xxxd1887xxx  is bound
within the cyclooxygenase site in the same overall lshaped conformation as aa. c-1 and c-11 through c-20
are in the same positions for both substrates, but the
positions of c-2 through c-10 differ by up to 1.74 å. in
general, substitutions of active site residues caused parallel changes in the oxygenation of both aa and  xxxd1887xxx .
two significant exceptions were val-349 and ser-530. a
v349a substitution caused an 800-fold decrease in the
vmax/km for  xxxd1887xxx  but less than a 2-fold change with aa;
kinetic evidence indicates that c-13 of  xxxd1887xxx  is improperly positioned with respect to tyr-385 in the v349a
mutant thereby preventing efficient hydrogen abstraction. val-349 contacts c-5 of  xxxd1887xxx  and appears to serve
as a structural bumper positioning the carboxyl half of
 xxxd1887xxx , which, in turn, positions properly the ␻-half of
this substrate. a v349a substitution in  xxxg1884xxx  has similar, minor effects on the rates of oxygenation of aa and
 xxxd1887xxx . thus, val-349 is a major determinant of substrate
specificity for  xxxg1883xxx  but not for  xxxg1884xxx . ser-530 also
influences the substrate specificity of  xxxg1883xxx ; an s530t
substitution causes 40- and 750-fold decreases in oxygenation efficiencies for aa and  xxxd1887xxx , respectively.

cyclooxygenase/fatty acid interactions

experimental procedures

materials— xxxd2154xxx  were purchased from cayman chemical co.,
ann arbor, mi. [1-14c] xxxd208xxx  (40 – 60 mci/mmol) and
[1-14c]dihomo-␥-linolenic ( xxxd1886xxx ) (50 – 60 mci/
mmol) were from perkinelmer life sciences.  xxxd2141xxx  was from
sigma. restriction enzymes and dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
were purchased from life technologies, inc. calf serum and fetal bovine serum were from hyclone. primary antibodies used for western
blotting were raised in rabbits against purified opghs-1 or human (h)
 xxxg1884xxx  and purified as igg fractions (40). goat anti-rabbit igg horseradish peroxidase conjugate was purchased from bio-rad. oligonucleotides used as primers for mutagenesis were prepared by the michigan
state university macromolecular structure, synthesis, and sequencing
facility. all other reagents were from common commercial sources.
preparation of opghs-1 and hpghs-2 mutants—mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of opghs-1 in the psvt7 vector
employing the stratagene quikchange mutagenesis kit and the protocol of the manufacturer (39, 40). oligonucleotides used in the preparation of various mutants were reported previously (39) except for two
opghs-1 mutants i434v, 5⬘-1375gccagcctgcaggccgggttggtgggggtagg-3⬘, and h513r, 5⬘-1617cttgagaagtgtcgaccgaactccatctttgg-3⬘, used for the construction of a quadruple mutant
v349a/i523v/i434v/h513r and two hpghs-2 mutants (41) v349a,
5⬘-1082gaagattatgcccaacacttg-3⬘, and v523i, 5⬘-1602ccatctttggtgaaacgatgatagaagttggagcacc-3⬘. plasmids used for
transfections were purified by cscl gradient ultracentrifugation, and
mutations were reconfirmed by double-stranded sequencing of the
psvt7 (opghs-1) or posml (hpghs-2) constructs using sequenase
(version 2.0, u. s. biochemical corp.) and the protocol described by the
manufacturer as described previously (39).
transfection of cos-1 cells with opghs-1 constructs—cos-1 cells
(attc crl-1650) were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
containing 8% calf serum and 2% fetal bovine serum and transfected
with psvt7 (opghs-1) or posml (hpghs-2) plasmid constructs containing cdnas encoding native or mutant enzymes using the deae
dextran/chloroquine transfection method (39, 41). forty hours following
transfection, cells were harvested, and microsomal membrane fractions

were prepared as described previously (39, 40). protein concentrations
were determined using the method of bradford (42) with bovine serum
albumin as the standard. microsomal preparations were used for western blotting and for cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays. all mutant
enzymes described in this report were expressed at protein levels similar to that of the native enzyme and retained ⱖ50% the peroxidase
activity of native opghs-1 (39).
cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays—cyclooxygenase assays were
performed at 37 °c by monitoring the initial rate of o2 uptake using an
oxygen electrode (39). reactions were initiated by adding ⬃250 ␮g of
microsomal protein in a volume of 20 –50 ␮l to the assay chamber. the
oxygenation of aa and  xxxd1887xxx  by native and mutant opghss-1 or
hpghss-2 was in all cases completely inhibited by the addition of 0.2
mm  xxxd2141xxx  to the reaction mixture. all data were normalized to
the relative levels of pghs protein expression as determined by western blotting and densitometry. fatty acid substrate concentrations of
100 ␮m were used to estimate maximal rates. km values were measured using concentrations of fatty acid substrates between 0.5 and 500
␮m as described previously (39). peroxidase activities were measured
spectrophotometrically with n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetramethylphenylenediamine
(tmpd) as the reducing cosubstrate (43) as reported previously (38).
reactions were initiated by adding 100 ␮l of 0.3 mm h2o2, and the
absorbance at 610 nm was monitored with time.
western blot analysis—microsomal samples (⬃5 ␮g of protein) were
resolved by one-dimensional sds-page and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes using a hoeffer scientific
semi-dry transfer apparatus. membranes were blocked for 12 h in 3%
nonfat dry milk, 0.1% tween 20, and tris-buffered saline, followed by a
2-h incubation with a peptide-directed antibody against opghs-1 or
hpghs-2 (40, 44) in 1% dry milk, 0.1% tween 20, and tris-buffered
saline at room temperature. membranes were washed and incubated
for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit igg-horseradish
peroxidase, after which they were incubated with amersham pharmacia biotech ecl reagents and exposed to film for chemiluminescence.
characterization of fatty acid oxygenation products—a general protocol for product analysis is as follows. forty hours following transfection, cos-1 cells were collected, sonicated, and resuspended in 0.1 m
tris-hcl, ph 7.5. aliquots of the cell suspension (100 –250 ␮g of protein)
were incubated for 1–10 min at 37 °c in 0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 7.5, containing 1 mm phenol and 6.8 ␮g of bovine hemoglobin in a total volume
of 200 ␮l. reactions were initiated by adding [1-14c]aa or [1-14c] xxxd1887xxx 
(35 ␮m final concentration) and were performed with or without 200 ␮m
 xxxd2141xxx  and stopped by adding 1.4 ml of chcl3:meoh (1:1, v/v).
insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 0.6 ml of
chcl3 and 0.32 ml of 0.88%  xxxd2154xxx  were added to the resulting
supernatant. the organic phase was collected, dried under n2, redissolved in 50 ␮l of chcl3, and spotted on a silica gel 60 thin layer
chromatography plate; the lipid products were chromatographed for 1 h
in benzene:dioxane: xxxd2154xxx :acetic acid (82:14:1:1, v/v). products
were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. negative control values from samples incubated with 200
␮m  xxxd2141xxx  were subtracted from the experimental values observed
for each sample in the absence of  xxxd2141xxx .
purification and crystallization—apo-opghs-1 was purified and
reconstituted with co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx  as described previously (7,
45). the co3⫹-heme opghs-1/ xxxd1887xxx  complex was formed by the addition of a 5-fold molar excess of  xxxd1887xxx  prior to crystallization. crystals
were grown in sitting-drops by combining the co3⫹-heme opghs1䡠dhla complex with buffer consisting of 0.64 m sodium citrate, 0.3–
0.6 m licl, 1 mm nan3, 0.33% (w/v) n-octyl-␤-d-glucopyranoside, ph 6.5,
and equilibrating over reservoir solutions containing 0.64 – 0.84 m sodium citrate, 0.3– 0.6 m licl, and 1 mm nan3 at 20 °c. the crystals
were harvested and transferred to stabilization buffer (0.9 m sodium
citrate, ph 6.5, 1.0 m licl, 0.15% (w/v) n-octyl-␤-d-glucopyranoside),
followed by a single step transfer to stabilization buffer with 24% (w/v)
sucrose as a cryoprotectant. the crystals were immediately frozen in
liquid propane at ⫺165 °c.
data collection—the co3⫹-heme opghs-1/ xxxd1887xxx  data set was assembled from two crystals. data were collected at ⫺165 °c on beamline
19-id of the structural biology center (advanced photon source, argonne, il) at a wavelength of 1.03321 å. each scan was processed
individually using hkl2000 (46) and then scaled together using
scalepack (46). details of the data collection and reduction are
summarized in table i.
co3⫹-heme opghs-1/ xxxd1887xxx  structural solution and refinement—
crystals of the co3⫹-heme opghs-1䡠dhla complex are isomorphous
with those of co3⫹-heme opghs-1 complexed with aa (7). therefore, all
ligands, detergent, and carbohydrate molecules were removed from the

ate; 18:2(n-6)),  xxxd1886xxx  (dihomo-␥- xxxd2490xxx ;
20:3(n-6)), and  xxxd2318xxx  (20:5(n-3)) are
also oxygenated via cyclooxygenase activity when added exogenously to intact cells (21, 22) or when mobilized from cellular
phosphoglycerides (23–27). in tissues such as vesicular gland
which have low levels of ⌬5-desaturase activity and thus low
levels of aa,  xxxd1887xxx  is converted efficiently to 1-series prostanoid products that are found in abundance in semen (25). other
less common  xxxd2154xxx  can also serve as cyclooxygenase substrates including adrenic acid (22:4(n-6)) (28), the mead acid
(5z,8z,11z-eicosatrienoic acid) (29), columbinic acid (5e,9z,12zoctadecatrienoic acid) (30, 31), and 5,6-oxido-eicosatrienoic acid (32,
33). substrates other than aa typically have somewhat higher km
values than aa but can compete with aa for the cyclooxygenase
active site thereby inhibiting formation of 2-series prostanoids.
this was first documented by lands and co-workers in vitro (34),
but this form of inhibition appears to occur in vivo as well (35–37).
a combination of crystallographic (7) and mutagenic (38, 39)
analyses of the interaction of aa within the cyclooxygenase
active site of ovine (o)  xxxg1883xxx  led us to assign active site
residues to five functional categories for aa oxygenation (39) as
follows: (a) residues directly involved in abstraction of the
13-pro-s-hydrogen (tyr-385); (b) residues essential for positioning c-13 for hydrogen abstraction (tyr-348 and gly-533);
(c) residues essential for high affinity binding of aa (arg-120);
and (d) residues critical for positioning aa such that following
abstraction of the 13-pro-s-hydrogen the arachidonyl radical is
converted to pgg2 instead of 11- or 15-monohydroperoxy acid
products (val-349, trp-387, and leu-534). here we report studies of opghs-1 that were designed (a) to determine how dihomo-␥-linoleic acid (20:3(n-6);  xxxd1887xxx ), a close homolog of aa,
binds within the cyclooxygenase active site and (b) to identify
active site residues that are determinants of cyclooxygenase
fatty acid substrate specificity.

co3⫹-heme opghs-1䡠aa complex (protein data bank code 1diy), and
the protein portion (residues 32–584) was used as the starting model.
refinement was performed using cns version 0.9a (47), employing the
maximum likelihood target using amplitudes, a bulk solvent correction,
and an overall temperature (b factor) correction, utilizing 2␴ data from
20.0 to 3.0 å. initial rigid-body refinement, followed by cycles of positional and group b factor refinement (main chain/side chain), resulted
in initial r and free r values of 25.8 and 28.8%, respectively. the 2fo ⫺
fc and fo ⫺ fc electron density maps calculated at this stage clearly
showed the position for co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx  and 9 carbohydrate
residues. these features are readily observable in the co3⫹-heme
opghs-1䡠aa complex (7) and have not been included in the initial
refinement protocol and map calculations, thus providing a good check
of model quality. in addition, strong electron density was observed for
 xxxd1887xxx  bound in the cyclooxygenase active site channel as well as for
three n-octyl-␤-d-glucopyranoside detergent molecules bound to the
membrane binding domain. these molecules were built into their corresponding electron density, followed by cycles of positional refinement,
group b factor refinement, and model inspection. a total of 60 water
molecules was then added at positions that were within 2.4 –3.6 å of a
hydrogen bond donor or acceptor and had electron density peaks greater
than 2.5␴ in fo ⫺ fc maps. the final model has r and free r values of
23.7 and 27.7%, respectively (table i). all residues lie within the most
favored or allowed regions of the ramachandran plot, and the parameters evaluated by procheck (48) are well within the bounds established from well refined structures at equivalent resolution. the mean
positional error in the structure was calculated to be 0.41 å (table i).
structural analysis—van der waals and hydrogen bond interactions
were calculated using the program chain (49). the criteria for a
hydrogen bond are that the three angles c⫽o–h, o–h-n, and h–n-c
be greater than 90° and the no distance not exceed 3.6 å. the upper
limit on distance for consideration as a van der waals contact is 4.0 å.
superposition of coordinates between structures was done using the
program align (50) and the coordinates for all calcium atoms unless
otherwise stated. the coordinates for co3⫹-heme opghs-1/ xxxd1887xxx  have
been deposited at the protein data bank (code 1fe2). mutations were
modeled and analyzed in the program chain (49).
results and discussion

structure of dihomo-␥- xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1887xxx ) bound in the
cyclooxygenase active site—we crystallized a complex of the
catalytically inert co3⫹-heme opghs-1 with  xxxd1887xxx  (4). the
crystal structure of the co3⫹-heme opghs-1䡠dhla complex
reveals all of the gross features expected of this dimeric, hemecontaining enzyme (4, 7). the tertiary structures of the n-

terminal  xxxg681xxx -like domain, the membrane
binding domain, and the catalytic domain were well resolved;
in addition, interpretable electron density was observed for
co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx , carbohydrate moieties at the three
n-linked glycosylation sites, and three ␤-octyl glucoside detergent molecules bound to the membrane binding domain (data
not shown).
 xxxd1887xxx  binds in the cyclooxygenase active site channel in an
extended l-shaped conformation grossly similar to that seen
for aa (7) (figs. 1 and 2). the carboxylate group is positioned
to interact with the side chain of arg-120, a known determinant of substrate binding to  xxxg1883xxx  (7, 39, 51), whereas the
␻-end of  xxxd1887xxx  binds in a hydrophobic groove located between
ser-530 and gly-533 along helix 17 (residues 520 –535). c-7
through c-14 are threaded around the side chain of ser-530,
the residue that can be acetylated by aspirin via an s-shaped
kink which, in turn, positions c-13 below tyr-385 for abstraction of the 13-pro-s-hydrogen. furthermore, c-11 is positioned
such that it is accessible to o2 addition to the antarafacial side
of the substrate.
despite their similar l-shaped conformations in the cyclooxygenase active site, the carboxyl halves of the  xxxd1887xxx  and
aa molecules differ quite significantly in their respective positions (fig. 2 and table ii). as the crystallographic analysis was
based on medium resolution diffraction data, it was important
to verify that the differences observed between the two substrates were significant and not due to crystallographic artifacts or over-interpretation. to test this hypothesis, we calculated fo ⫺ fc difference electron density maps using the
observed structure factors from the co3⫹-heme opghs1䡠dhla complex but with phases calculated from the refined
co3⫹-heme opghs-1 protein model and the refined model of
aa from the co3⫹-heme opghs-1/aa crystal structure (7)
placed in the cyclooxygenase active site. as the root mean
square deviation in the carboxylate region (c-2 through c-10)
between aa and  xxxd1887xxx  is greater than 1 å, we would expect to
observe the appropriate positive and negative difference density peaks in the fo ⫺ fc difference electron density maps if the
data contained sufficient information to detect these conformational differences. analysis of these maps contoured at 3␴
showed two positive peaks corresponding to the correct location
for c-3 and c-4 and c-6 through c-8 (data not shown); these
are the two regions in  xxxd1887xxx  whose positions show the largest
deviations from aa (fig. 2). similarly, appropriate negative
difference peaks corresponding to misplacement of the above
carbons were also observed. therefore, we can conclude that
the diffraction data are of sufficient quality and resolution to
discern the differences in conformation between  xxxd1887xxx  and aa
in the cyclooxygenase active site and that the current model
accurately represents those differences at this resolution.
moreover, no constraints on substrate binding arising from the
cyclooxygenase catalytic mechanism were used in building the
 xxxd1887xxx  model and no alternate models could be built for  xxxd1887xxx 
given its stereochemical constraints.
comparison of  xxxd1887xxx  and aa binding in the cyclooxygenase
active site—the r.m.s. deviation between the crystal structures of co3⫹-heme opghs-1/aa and co3⫹-heme opghs-1/
 xxxd1887xxx  is 0.19 å (550 out of 554 c␣ atoms) indicating that the
overall tertiary makeup of both structures is conserved.  xxxd1887xxx 
makes a total of 62 contacts with 19 residues lining the cyclooxygenase channel (fig. 3). only 3 of the 62 contacts are
hydrophilic, consisting of a salt bridge between the carboxylate
and the guanidinium group of arg-120 and two hydrogen bonds
between the carboxylate and the side chains of arg-120 and
tyr-355. these contacts are key to stabilizing the carboxylate
group in what is otherwise a predominantly hydrophobic active

site channel. aa also makes contacts with 19 active site residues in the active center although with four significant differences as follows: ser-353 and ile-377 make contacts with aa
but not  xxxd1887xxx , whereas val-228 and phe518 make contacts
with  xxxd1887xxx  but not aa. mutational analysis of both ser-353
and ile-377 (39), which contact c-3 and c-20 of aa, respectively
(7), have indicated that neither of these residues is especially
important either for binding the substrate or for positioning
c-13 with respect to tyr-385 for cyclooxygenase catalysis (39).
as mentioned above, the carboxyl halves of the  xxxd1887xxx  and
aa molecules differ quite significantly in their respective conformations (fig. 2 and table ii). specifically, the relative positions of c-2 through c-10 are very different between aa and
 xxxd1887xxx  due to the absence of the c-5/c-6 double bond in  xxxd1887xxx .
however, c-1, whose position is critical for the formation of
carboxylate interactions with arg-120, and carbons c-11
through c-20, which are involved in the alignment of c-13 for

hydrogen abstraction and for the initial oxygen insertion, are in
the same positions for both substrates. this is further reflected
in the r.m.s. deviation between carbon positions in  xxxd1887xxx  versus aa calculated for c-1 through c-10 and c-11 through c-20
(1.07 and 0.45 å, respectively). the absence of a c-5/c-6 double
bond in  xxxd1887xxx  permits greater conformational flexibility of the
carboxyl half of this fatty acid versus aa. c-2 through c-10
take on a more compact, coiled structure that allows  xxxd1887xxx  to
make the required carboxylate interaction with arg-120 and to
properly align c-13 below tyr-385 for hydrogen abstraction
(fig. 2). as a consequence of this binding arrangement, the
carboxyl half of  xxxd1887xxx  is positioned closer to helix 17, where it
makes 15 contacts with active site residues. conversely, there
are only four contacts with helix 6 (figs. 1 and 3). moreover, the
cg2 atom of ile-523 and o␥ of ser-530 move to accommodate
the substrate. these atoms move 0.9 and 1.1 å, respectively,

plex (fig. 2). despite the different positions for c-8 and c-9 in
 xxxd1887xxx  versus aa, there are no stereochemical or geometrical
constraints introduced that would prevent endoperoxide bridge
formation and subsequent cyclopentane ring closure via the
same mechanism proposed for aa (7).
determinants of substrate specificity—to learn more about
the structural basis for the substrate specificities of cyclooxygenases, we first compared effects of active site substitutions
on the rates of oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  and aa focusing on
hydrophobic residues that contact the alkyl chains of these
 xxxd2154xxx  (figs. 2 and 3). all of the hydrophobic residues
examined, when mutated, decreased the rates of oxygenation of
aa and  xxxd1887xxx  when tested with relatively high (100 ␮m) substrate concentrations (table iii). for most substitutions, the
rate of oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  was somewhat less than the rate
of oxygenation of aa, presumably because  xxxd1887xxx  is a slightly
poorer substrate for the native enzyme. however, substitutions
of most hydrophobic active site residues caused approximately
parallel changes in the rates of oxygenation of both  xxxd1887xxx  and
aa (table iii). the obvious exceptions were val-349 and
ser-530.
some cyclooxygenase active site mutants (i.e. v349a, v349l,
w387f, w387l, and s530t opghs-1) have previously been

shown to alter rather dramatically the distribution of oxygenated products formed from aa by opghs-1 (39). accordingly,
we analyzed the oxygenation products formed from
[1-14c] xxxd1887xxx  by these mutants (data not shown). all of these
mutants, with the exception of s530t opghs-1, produced an
excess of hydroxy acid products (hetres) from  xxxd1887xxx  relative
to the primary product pgg1 but in significantly reduced
amounts compared with aa. for example, when compared with
native enzyme v349a opghs-1 produced a 20-fold increase in
11-hete from aa (39) but less than a 2-fold increase in hetre products from  xxxd1887xxx . w387f and w387l opghs-1 produced a 13-fold increase in hete products from aa (39) and a
6-fold increase in hetre products from  xxxd1887xxx . s530t
opghs-1, which relative to native enzyme produces an abundance of 15-hete from aa (39), formed products in ratios
identical to the native enzyme when incubated with  xxxd1887xxx .

double bond in  xxxd1887xxx  allows for greater conformational flexibility in the carboxyl half of the substrates as compared with aa. this is reflected in

we interpret the rate data (table iii) and the results of the
product analyses broadly to indicate that residues other than
val-349 and ser-530 perform similar functions in the oxygenation of both aa and  xxxd1887xxx  (39). as discussed below substitutions of val-349 and ser-530 were examined in greater detail as
possible determinants of substrate specificity.
val-349 as a determinant of fatty acid substrate specificity
of opghs-1—a v349a substitution in opghs-1 caused a dramatic decrease in the vmax/km values for  xxxd1887xxx  relative to the
change seen with aa (table iv). although v349a opghs-1
oxygenates aa with a catalytic efficiency that is 65% that of
native opghs-1 (39), the vmax/km value for the v349a
opghs-1 mutant was decreased more than 800-fold with
 xxxd1887xxx  (table iv). because  xxxd1887xxx  was such an inefficient substrate for v349a opghs-1, we were able to test  xxxd1887xxx  as an
inhibitor of aa oxygenation.  xxxd1887xxx  was a competitive inhibitor
of aa oxygenation with a ki value of 2 ␮m (table iv). the
similarity between the km value of native opghs-1 for  xxxd1887xxx 
and the ki value for  xxxd1887xxx  inhibition of aa oxygenation by
v349a opghs-1 suggests that  xxxd1887xxx  can bind to the v349a
opghs-1 mutant with approximately the same affinity as
 xxxd1887xxx  binds native opghs-1; however,  xxxd1887xxx  must bind
v349a opghs-1 in a catalytically unproductive conformation
such that abstraction of the 13-pro-s-hydrogen cannot occur

efficiently.
while substitution of val-349 with alanine has a relatively
large impact on the ability of opghs-1 to oxygenate  xxxd1887xxx ,
substitution with a larger residue, leucine, has a much more
modest effect relative to the decrease in catalytic efficiency
observed with aa (table iv). the vmax/km value for v349l is
decreased about 6-fold with aa and about 19-fold with  xxxd1887xxx .
the difference between the efficiency of aa and  xxxd1887xxx  oxygenation by v349l is largely due to the increased km value for
oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx .
the greater importance of val-349 in the efficiency of oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  versus aa by opghs-1 can be rationalized
by comparing the co-crystal structures of these two homologous
 xxxd2154xxx  in complexes with opghs-1 (fig. 2 and table ii).
val-349 is positioned slightly differently in the two structures.
additionally, val-349 makes a single van der waals contact
with  xxxd1887xxx  involving c-5 of the substrate and the  xxxd435xxx  atom of
val-349; in contrast, aa makes two contacts with val-349
involving c-3 and c-4. the c-3 through c-5 segment of  xxxd1887xxx 
is positioned on one side by interactions involving ala527,
gly-526, and ile-523, whereas val-349 acts as a structural
bumper on the other side of this fatty acid.
computer modeling indicates that substitution of val-349
with alanine opens up a substantial pocket into which the c-3
to c-5 segment of the  xxxd1887xxx  molecule could move. this could
occur because of the flexibility of  xxxd1887xxx  in the c-3 to c-5
region. this movement would lead to a significant change in
the position of c-13 of  xxxd1887xxx  with respect to tyr-385 such that
abstraction of the 13-pro-s-hydrogen could not occur efficiently. the structure of aa is more constrained because of the
presence of its c-5/c-6 double bond and thus would be less
affected by the v349a substitution. the movement that does
occur with aa affects the position of c-9 with respect to c-11
leading to increased 11-hpete formation but does not affect
the positioning of c-13 with respect to tyr-385 (39).
computer modeling of a leucine at position 349 in the co3⫹heme opghs-1䡠aa and co3⫹-heme opghs-1䡠dhla complexes
suggests that leucine would crowd the carboxyl end of both aa
and  xxxd1887xxx  with the net effect of moving c-13 slightly away
from tyr-385. however, the extra rigidity of aa compared with
 xxxd1887xxx  apparently makes aa slightly more resistant to the
intrusion of the larger leucine at position 349. again however,
compared with v349a opghs-1, v349l opghs-1 has relatively similar activities with both aa and  xxxd1887xxx .
ile-523 also contacts c-5 of  xxxd1887xxx  (figs. 1–3 and table ii),
but elimination of the c-5 contact with ile-523 by replacement
of this residue with an alanine is relatively unimportant functionally apparently because of compensatory interactions with
ala-527 and gly-526 (fig. 2 and tables ii–iv).
overall, val-349 appears to provide the one critical interaction with the carboxyl end of  xxxd1887xxx  that is responsible for
proper positioning of the 13-pro-s-hydrogen for abstraction by
tyr-385.
val-349 in human  xxxg1884xxx —although val-349 is an important determinant of the substrate specificity for  xxxg1883xxx , it is
not an important determinant for  xxxg1884xxx  (table iv). v349a
human (h)  xxxg1884xxx  oxygenates  xxxd1887xxx  and aa with comparable
efficiencies, approximately half of those observed with the native enzyme (table iv). v349a hpghs-2 does behaves like
v349a opghs-1 in producing large amounts of 11-hete-30%
compared with 5% for native hpghs-1. however, there were
no differences in the distribution of oxygenated products
formed from  xxxd1887xxx  by v349a hpghs-2 versus native
hpghs-2. overall, the key difference between v349a opghs-1
and v349a hpghs-2 is the inability of v349a opghs-1 to
oxygenate  xxxd1887xxx  efficiently (table iv).

the differences between the specificities of v349a opghs-1
and v349a hpghs-2 for  xxxd1887xxx  led us to construct two additional opghs-1 mutants (v349a/i523v and v349a/i523v/
h513r/i434v opghs-1) in an attempt to develop a modified
‘version of v349a opghs-1 that would mimic v349a hpghs-2
(table iv). however, both the double (v349a/i523v opghs-1)
and quadruple (v349a/i523v/h513r/i434v opghs-1) v349a
mutants exhibited the same profile of oxygenation products as
the corresponding single v349a opghs-1 and hpghs-2 mutants, and the double and quadruple mutants showed only
small increases in the rates of oxygenation of both aa and
 xxxd1887xxx  (table iv). finally, substituting val-523 with an isoleucine in v349a hpghs-2 simply decreased the catalytic efficiencies of oxygenation of both aa and  xxxd1887xxx .
the volume of the cyclooxygenase active site of hpghs-2 is
⬃20% larger than that of opghs-1 (4 – 6). this volume difference is the result of three differences in amino acid residues
between the isozymes as follows: ile-523 is a valine; his-513 is
an arginine; and ile-434 is a valine in  xxxg1884xxx . computer
modeling of the v349a/i523v/h513r/i434v opghs-1 quadruple mutant indicates that this mutant is similar structurally to
 xxxg1884xxx  (i.e. the cyclooxygenase active site of the quadruple
mutant has a 20% greater volume than that of native opghs1). nonetheless, the v349a/i523v/h513r/i434v opghs-1 mutant has a substrate specificity that closely resembles v349a
opghs-1 and not v349a hpghs-2. thus, the reason that
v349a hpghs-2 but not v349a opghs-1 can oxygenate
 xxxd1887xxx  efficiently must be attributable to a factor other than
the difference between the volumes of the cyclooxygenase sites
of the isozymes. it is possible that differences in the interactions of the carboxylate groups of aa and  xxxd1887xxx  with arg-120
in  xxxg1883xxx  versus  xxxg1884xxx  (41, 51–52) in some way override the
differences in volume.3
ser-530 as a determinant of substrate specificity—ser-530
3
the differences observed between the opghs-1 and hpghs-2
v349a mutants in their abilities to oxygenate aa versus  xxxd1887xxx  may be
due indirectly to the reliance of substrate binding to  xxxg1883xxx  on an ionic
interaction between arg-120 and the carboxylate of fatty acid substrates (51);  xxxg1884xxx  does not need this ionic interaction for effective
substrate binding and oxygenation (41). this difference may provide
substrates with more freedom of movement in the  xxxg1884xxx  active site.

is the site of acetylation of opghs-1 by aspirin (53, 54). earlier
studies with opghs-1 involving aa as the substrate had
shown that substitution of ser-530 with alanine has relatively
little effect on aa oxygenation, that replacement of ser-530
with threonine causes a 95% drop in catalytic efficiency, and
that replacement of ser-530 with glutamine or valine prevents
catalysis apparently by blocking substrate access to the tyr385 radical (39, 53, 55).
we have extended these findings to show that a s530a
mutation has a somewhat larger effect on the efficiency of
oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  versus aa due primarily to a greater
than 4-fold increase in km (table iii). furthermore, there is a
750-fold decrease in the efficiency of oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  with
the s530t opghs-1 mutant (table iii). although s530t
opghs-1 is relatively inactive with both aa and  xxxd1887xxx , there
is both a 5-fold decrease in the vmax for oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx 
versus aa and a 7.5-fold increase in the km. as discussed
above, s530t opghs-1 produces a distribution of oxygenated
products similar to the native enzyme when incubated with
 xxxd1887xxx , whereas this mutant produces a relative abundance of
(15r)-hete when incubated with aa (39). overall, the data
with the ser-530 mutants indicate that substitutions of this
residue with amino acids having either larger or smaller side
chains is considerably more important for the oxygenation of
 xxxd1887xxx  than aa probably due to an effect on the positioning of
the 13-pro-s-hydrogen of these substrates for abstraction by
tyr-385.
there are three van der waals contacts between ser-530 and
aa involving c-10 and c-16 of the substrate (7, 39). there are
six van der waals contacts between ser-530 and  xxxd1887xxx  involving c-10, c-13, c-15, c-16, and c-17 (figs. 2 and 3 and table
ii). in both cases, the contacts are on the side of the substrate
directly opposite tyr-385. ser-530 is one of only two residues in
the cyclooxygenase active site that has a slightly different
orientation in the co3⫹-heme opghs-1/ xxxd1887xxx  crystal structure compared with the opghs-1-aa structure. in the  xxxd1887xxx 
structure both the c␣ and c␤ of ser-530 are oriented more
toward the fatty acid molecule than in the aa structure. two
critical contacts made between ser-530 and  xxxd1887xxx  not observed with aa are contacts at c-13 (the position of hydrogen
abstraction) and c-15. apparently, the greater flexibility of the

carboxyl end of  xxxd1887xxx  requires that the enzyme provide additional stabilizing influences near c-13 to optimize positioning
of the 13-pro-s-hydrogen with respect to tyr-385. analysis of
the co3⫹-heme opghs-1/ xxxd1887xxx  crystal structure indicates
that the mid-section of the fatty acid is folded more tightly
against ser-530 than is that of aa, making the residue at
position 530 that much more essential for efficient catalysis in
the case of  xxxd1887xxx .
conclusion—aa is the preferred substrate for the cyclooxygenase activity of  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx . both isozymes can also
oxygenate other c18, c20, and c22 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
albeit with lesser efficiencies than aa (13, 20, 28 –34).  xxxd1887xxx  is
the closest aa homologue lacking only the the c-5/c-6 double
bond of aa and is oxygenated with 50% of the catalytic efficiency of aa by native opghs-1 (table iv). in this study we
have shown that  xxxd1887xxx  is bound in the cyclooxygenase active
site of  xxxg1883xxx  in an l-shaped conformation in a manner similar to that of aa but that the regions between c2-and c-10 are
positioned quite differently for the two substrates. additionally, we have observed that among the 19 active site residues
that contact  xxxd1887xxx , val-349 and ser-530 are particularly important for the efficient oxygenation of  xxxd1887xxx  and thus serve as
determinants of cyclooxygenase fatty acid specificity.
