the rates of inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (ache;  xxxg38xxx ) by paraoxon, haloxon, ddvp and
enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates and cationic alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines
were measured in the presence and absence of ache peripheral site inhibitors:  xxxd2174xxx ,  xxxd3456xxx ,
 xxxd3027xxx , atropine and derivatives of coumarin. all ligands, except the coumarins, at submillimolar
concentrations enhanced the rates of inhibition by neutral organophosphates, whereas inhibition rates by
cationic organophosphates were decreased. when peripheral site ligand concentrations extended to millimolar
concentrations the extent of the enhancement decreased, creating a well-shaped activation profile. analysis
of inhibition by ddvp revealed that peripheral site inhibitors increase the second-order reaction rates by
increasing maximal rates of phosphorylation.
these observations suggest that peripheral site ligands are capable of allosterically affecting the conformation of residues in the choline binding site of ache, thus optimizing the position of the leaving group of
uncharged organophosphates during the inhibition reaction. copyright  2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.

some inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (ache; ec
3.1.1.7)-catalysed acetylthiocholine hydrolysis are known
to accelerate hydrolysis of certain neutral substrates. the
enzymic hydrolysis of a series of small neutral acetates
is accelerated, for example, in the presence of n-acetyl
acridinium cation.1 similarly, binding of small cationic
ligands, such as tetramethyl-or  xxxd3339xxx , into
the ache active center was shown to increase rates of
ache acetylation by carbamyl and sulfonyl fluorides.2,3
the small size of these neutral acylating agents and the
corresponding cations that modulate the kinetics allow for
their simultaneous coexistence within the ache active
center gorge.
in this study we have examined the acceleration of
the rate of phosphylation of mouse ache with neutral organophosphates but when accelerating ligands were
bound to the peripheral site of ache.

(fig. 1), but derivatives of coumarin reduced the rates of
phosphylation.

charged (acetylthiocholine) substrates. both activation
of phosphylation and inhibition of substrate hydrolysis
occurred in a biphasic manner, consistent with the formation of at least two different enzyme–inhibitor/accelerator
complexes. formation of the accelerating complex was
shown primarily to increase the maximal rates of phosphylation by ddvp (fig. 2) while not affecting the ddvp
affinity for ache.
the magnitude of enhancement of the inhibition rates
was reduced by amino acid replacements at the peripheral
site, whereas selective replacements at the choline binding
site increased the magnitude of enhancement of inhibition
achieved with peripheral site ligands. the enhancement
was potentiated further by simultaneous substitution of

residues in the choline binding site and in the acyl pocket
of the enzyme.
in summary, the acceleration of ache acylation by
neutral organophosphates can be interpreted in terms
of binding of the accelerating ligand to an allosteric
site. binding of a peripheral site ligand on the surface
of the enzyme enhances the rate of acylation occurring in its active center. presumably this occurs by
influencing a change in conformation, therein the orientation of the leaving group of the organophosphate.
thus, as suggested in previous studies,4 the peripheral site at the surface of the enzyme is linked to
the active center through a conformational change of
protein.
