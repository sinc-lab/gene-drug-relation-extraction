the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative fpi/02 antagonist selectivity of the f-adrenoceptor blocker  xxxd2689xxx , in lower than conventional clinical
doses.
2 eight normal volunteers received single oral doses of either placebo (pl),  xxxd2689xxx 
5 mg (n5), 20 mg (n20) or 80 mg (n80) in a single-blind, randomised crossover
design. j1-adrenoceptor antagonism was assessed by attenuation of exercise
tachycardia, and p2-adrenoceptor blockade by effects on salbutamol-induced
chronotropic, hypokalaemic and finger tremor responses. the relative percentage
attenuation of 02 and  xxxg2051xxx -mediated responses was calculated and expressed as ,2:1
selectivity ratios.
3  xxxd2689xxx  produced dose-related reductions in exercise tachycardia in keeping with
increasing f1-adrenoceptor blockade; mean % reduction (95% ci) compared with
placebo: n5 10.7 (6.6 to 14.8), n20 21.4 (17.3 to 25.4), n80 38.9 (34.8 to 42.9).
however, even the lowest dose of  xxxd2689xxx  (5 mg) produced almost complete
blunting of p2-mediated effects and significantly increased exercise hyperkalaemia; peak exercise hyperkalaemia (mmol 1-1) (means and 95% ci): pl 4.88
(4.68 to 5.07), n5 5.36 (5.17 to 5.55), n20 5.48 (5.28 to 5.67), n80 5.42 (5.22 to
5.61). 0f2:013 selectivity ratios significantly increased as the dose of  xxxd2689xxx  was
reduced.
4 these data suggest that whereas in the clinical dose range  xxxd2689xxx  behaves as a
non-selective ,b-adrenoceptor antagonist, as the dose is reduced this drug demonstrates an increasing degree of selectivity for the 0,2-adrenoceptor.
5
low-dose oral  xxxd2689xxx  may therefore be a useful selective j32-adrenoceptor antagonist for research studies in man.

introduction

0-adrenoceptor antagonists have conventionally been
classified into two main groups: 'non-selective' agents
which block p and p2-adrenoceptors, and drugs which
exhibit greater antagonism at one or other p-adrenoceptor subtype, being termed 'selective' for that
receptor. it has however become evident that padrenoceptor subtype selectivity is a relative rather
than an absolute property, in that drugs which are intrinsically selective for either the pi or p2-adrenoceptor have been found to antagonise the other
receptor subtype in a dose-dependent manner [1-3].
whether the reverse occurs is not entirely clear;

i.e. will a j-adrenoceptor blocking drug which is
'non-selective' polarise its effects in favour of one or
other ,-adrenoceptor subtype when used in a lower
than conventional dose. there is some evidence to
suggest that this may be the case with propranolol.
firstly, in vitro studies have demonstrated that propranolol has a 2-3 fold greater affinity for ,12 than
1 -adrenoceptors [4, 5]. secondly, a low dose of propranolol (10 mg) produces a proportionately greater
degree of antagonism of p2 compared with ,1-adrenoceptor mediated responses in vivo [6].
if low dose oral propranolol does indeed behave as a

relatively p2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, this
might prove to be a useful pharmacological probe for
dissecting out pi and p2-mediated responses in vivo.
however, since oral propranolol undergoes significant
first-pass hepatic metabolism, we decided to investigate the properties of low dose oral  xxxd2689xxx  which is
hydrophilic and therefore exhibits more predictable
pharmacokinetics.
thus, the purpose of the present study was to
evaluate the p2:41-adrenoceptor selectivity of lower
than conventional doses of oral  xxxd2689xxx . p1-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed by reduction of maximal exercise tachycardia [6, 7], and 02-adrenoceptor
blockade by attenuation of chronotropic, finger tremor
and hypokalaemic responses to the selective j2adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol [8, 9].

methods

subjects
eight normal volunteers were studied with a mean
age (s.e. mean) of 23 ± 3 years. prior to entry into
the study all subjects provided written informed consent and were required to have had a normal physical
examination, full blood count, biochemical profile,
urinalysis and 12-lead electrocardiogram. exclusion
criteria were a history of asthma, hypertension,
cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes and thyroid disease,
and no subjects were taking concurrent medication.
approval for the study was granted by the tayside
medical ethics committee.
protocol
subjects attended the laboratory at the same time
of day on each of the 4 study days, which were
separated by weekly intervals. all had fasted for 4 h
prior to attendance and physical exercise, nicotine
and caffeine consumption were prohibited on study
days. treatments were given in a single-blind, randomised (latin square), crossover design and 2.5 h
prior to attendance subjects ingested single oral doses
of either placebo (pl),  xxxd2689xxx  5 mg (n5),  xxxd2689xxx  20
mg (n20) or  xxxd2689xxx  80 mg (n80). on arrival subjects were weighed and an intravenous cannula was
inserted into each antecubital fossa for the purposes
of blood sampling and drug infusion. blood was
withdrawn for measurement of plasma  xxxd2689xxx  concentrations at the time point 2.5 h after ingestion.
subjects then performed a standardised 3 min exercise step test [7] in order to achieve maximum exercise heart rate. peak exercise heart rate (ehr) was
recorded and immediately on completion of exercise
venous blood was taken for the measurement of
serum potassium (k). subjects then rested supine for
a 45 min recovery period. baseline measurements of
heart rate (hr) and postural finger tremor (tr) were
made and blood withdrawn for measurement of serum
k and  xxxd2689xxx  concentration. subsequently an intravenous infusion of salbutamol sulphate ('ventolin',
allen and hanburys ltd, middlesex, uk) in 0.9%

 xxxd3213xxx  was given at a rate of 0.2 ,ug kg-l

min-' for 30 min, and measurements of hr, tr, k
and plasma salbutamol concentrations were made at
10 min intervals throughout.

measurements
for safety purposes, heart rate was continuously recorded throughout the study period and the mean
heart rate at each time point calculated from the mean
of five consistent r-r intervals. postural finger tremor
was measured by a previously validated method [10]
with an accelerometer transducer (entran ltd, ealing,
uk) and computer-assisted spectral analysis using
autocovariance. the total tremor power >20 hz was
calculated from the mean of five consistent recordings and used for analysis. all blood samples were
analysed in batches at the end of the study and
assayed in duplicate. serum potassium was measured
by flame photometry (il 943 analyser; instrumentation laboratory ltd, warrington, uk). the normal
reference range for serum potassium in our laboratory
is 3.5-5.0 mmol l-1. plasma drug concentrations were
analysed by high performance liquid chromatography
using  xxxd2957xxx  as an internal standard for the  xxxd2689xxx 
assay. the respective coefficients of variability for
analytical imprecision within and between assays
were as follows:  xxxd2689xxx  (2 ng ml-) 12.4% and 15.9%;
 xxxd2689xxx  (50 ng ml-') 4.4% and 6.8%; salbutamol (7.5
ng ml-') 4.0% and 6.7%.

statistical analysis
all data were analysed using a 'statgraphics' software package (stsc software publishing group,
bethesda, usa). repeated measures multifactorial
analysis of variance was used to compare the effects
of treatments on the time profiles of each variable.
bonferroni multiple range testing with confidence
limits set at 95% was used to identify time points
where differences between treatments were significant. all results are calculated as changes from
baseline and are expressed in the text as means and
95% confidence intervals. plasma drug concentrations
are given as means ± s.e. mean. effects of treatments
on exercise tachycardia are expressed as a percentage
reduction compared with the maximum heart rate
obtained with placebo. similarly, treatment effects on
salbutamol-induced chronotropic, hypokalaemic and
finger tremor responses are expressed as a percentage
reduction compared with the maximal effect obtained
with placebo. salbutamol effects are given at the time
point of peak response, 30 min after the start of the
infusion. 42:51 selectivity ratios for each treatment
were calculated by comparing the percentage reduction of each salbutamol-induced response (j2) with
the percentage reduction of exercise tachycardia (p1).
a probability value of p < 0.05 was considered as
being of significance for all statistical tests, and
hence for clarity individual p values are not given
where a result is stated in the text to be significant.
the use of eight subjects allowed a 0.3 mmol 1-l
change in the end-point of serum potassium to be
detected with 80% power.

discussion
the results of the present study show that whereas a
reduction in the dose of  xxxd2689xxx  to lower than conventional levels is associated with a progressive
decline in f1-adrenoceptor blockade, p2-antagonism

is maintained and is almost maximal even at the
lowest dose of 5 mg; i.e. a gradual shift towards
selective f2-adrenoceptor blockade occurs as the dose
is reduced. this suggests that as the dose of  xxxd2689xxx 
is progressively reduced, there is a relatively flat
dose-response curve for 032-adrenoceptor blockade,
but a steep dose-response for p1-adrenoceptor blockade in vivo.  xxxd2689xxx  therefore appears to exhibit
a greater affinity for 02 than p1-receptors. this
phenomenon has to a lesser extent been demonstrated
with propranolol, both in vitro and in vivo [4-6],
although to our knowledge no previous studies have

 xxxd2689xxx  and relative
been performed using  xxxd2689xxx . the findings of the
current study with  xxxd2689xxx  are substantiated by previous data using  xxxd2398xxx , a non-selective 1/p2adrenoceptor agonist [11]. it was shown that a 5 mg
dose of  xxxd2689xxx  produced almost complete p2-adrenoceptor blockade in terms of the finger tremor response to  xxxd2398xxx , but had no effect on the
systolic blood pressure response which is predominantly pi-mediated [12]. higher doses of  xxxd2689xxx  (20
mg and 80 mg) produced complete blunting of both
the pi and p2-mediated effects of  xxxd2398xxx . taken
together, these studies therefore imply that  xxxd2689xxx  is
only non-selective at doses used in clinical practice
(40-160 mg), but at lower doses (5 mg) it produces
preferential 02-adrenoceptor blockade.
in order to understand more clearly the results of
this study, it is important to consider the methodology
we have used to evaluate pl- and p2-adrenoceptor
blockade in vivo. f31-adrenoceptor antagonism was
assessed by attenuation of exercise tachycardia [6, 7],
since it has been shown that j3-adrenoceptor antagonists produce dose-related reductions in this response
[1, 2, 13], whereas selective 032-adrenoceptor blockade has no effect [6, 12]. in the present study,
increasing doses of  xxxd2689xxx  produced a progressive
reduction in exercise heart rate in keeping with 3ladrenoceptor antagonism, and significant differences
in response were apparent at each dose increment.
02-adrenoceptor antagonism was assessed by
studying the effects of treatments on the chronotropic, hypokalaemic and finger tremor responses
to the selective 02-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol
[8, 9]. in each case the pattern of the response was
similar. salbutamol produced significant increases in
heart rate and finger tremor, and a significant fall in
serum potassium in keeping with 02-receptor stimulation. chronotropic responses were considered to be
p2-mediated, since there is no good evidence to suggest that salbutamol loses 02-adrenoceptor selectivity
at this dose. all doses of  xxxd2689xxx  completely blocked
these responses, demonstrating that near-maximal
02-adrenoceptor blockade occurred even using the
lowest dose of  xxxd2689xxx  (5 mg). in addition, it has previously been shown that drugs which block p2adrenoceptors potentiate the hyperkalaemic response
to exercise [2, 14, 15], and this was also used as an
additional index of p2-adrenoceptor antagonism. in
this respect, all doses of  xxxd2689xxx  used in the present
study produced a significant increase in peak exercise

pilif2-adrenoceptor blockade

hyperkalaemia compared with placebo. a doseresponse effect was not seen, implying that even the
lowest dose of  xxxd2689xxx  (5 mg) produced near-maximal p2-adrenoceptor blockade, and this is in keeping
with its effects on the other ,b2-mediated responses
previously discussed.
having demonstrated individually the pi and 2blocking effects of each dose of  xxxd2689xxx , it is now
important to consider the concept of 0-adrenoceptor
subtype selectivity and how this should be expressed.
several 3-adrenoceptor antagonists such as atenolol,
bisoprolol and betaxolol are known to block pi to a
much greater degree than f2-receptors and are termed
, i-selective. however, selectivity is a relative rather
than an absolute property, since it has been shown
that increasing doses of a pi-selective antagonist produces dose-related p2-adrenoceptor blockade [1, 2, 8,
9] and that higher doses of the p2-adrenoceptor selective antagonist ici 118,551 inhibit exercise tachycardia [3]. although dose-related 02-adrenoceptor
blockade becomes evident, drugs such as atenolol,
even in large doses do not antagonise 02-receptors to
the same degree as for example, do propranolol or
 xxxd2689xxx , and in this respect they do not become truly
'non-selective' [8].
in pharmacological terms, 0-adrenoceptor subtype
selectivity refers to the ratio of p2:41 antagonism. in
the present study we therefore compared the effects
of  xxxd2689xxx  on the percentage reduction of salbutamolinduced responses (p2-adrenoceptor blockade), with
its effects on reduction of exercise tachycardia (,ladrenoceptor blockade), and the results were expressed as a i2/i1 selectivity ratio for each variable.
a similar pattern of response occurred for chronotropic, hypokalaemic and finger tremor effects, in that
increasing doses of  xxxd2689xxx  produced a significant and
progressive fall in the i2/1 selectivity ratio.
in summary, we have evaluated the f i and p2adrenoceptor antagonism produced by  xxxd2689xxx  across
a 16-fold dose range (5-80 mg), and have shown that
this drug displays selective 082-adrenoceptor blockade
at doses lower than those used in clinical practice.
low-dose  xxxd2689xxx  (5 mg) may therefore be a useful
02-selective antagonist for use as a research tool.
