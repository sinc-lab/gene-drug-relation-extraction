carvedilol inhibits  xxxg2296xxx -␣–induced endothelial
transcription factor activation, adhesion molecule expression,
and adhesiveness to human mononuclear cells

objective—we tested the hypothesis that carvedilol, a ␤-adrenoceptor and ␣-adrenoceptor antagonist with potent
antioxidant property, could inhibit  xxxg2296xxx -␣ (tnf-␣)–induced endothelial adhesiveness to human
mononuclear cells (mncs), an early sign of atherogenesis.
methods and results—circulating mncs were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. compared with
control condition, pretreatment of carvedilol (10 ␮mol/l for 18 hours) or  xxxd3014xxx  (5 ␮mol/l for 18 hours), but not
propanolol,  xxxd3000xxx , or both propanolol and  xxxd3000xxx  significantly decreased tnf-␣–stimulated adhesiveness of
cultured human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) to mncs. carvedilol inhibited tnf-␣–stimulated endothelial vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 ( xxxg2406xxx ) and  xxxg2048xxx  (66.0⫾2.0% and 55.60⫾1.0% of control, p⬍0.05, respectively)
expression, whereas  xxxd3014xxx  inhibited only  xxxg2406xxx  expression (79.0⫾5.0% of control, p⬍0.05). propanolol,
 xxxd3000xxx , or both did not alter the expression of adhesion molecules. further, pretreatment with carvedilol significantly
inhibited tnf-␣–stimulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) production and the activation of redox sensitive
nuclear factor kappa b and  xxxg1222xxx  transcription pathways.
conclusions—carvedilol reduced tnf-␣–stimulated endothelial adhesiveness to human mncs by inhibiting intracellular
ros production, transcription factor activation, and  xxxg2406xxx  as well as  xxxg2048xxx  expression, suggesting its potential
role in clinical atherosclerosis disease. (arterioscler thromb vasc biol. 2004;24:2075-2081.)

is currently used for treatment of hypertension or symptomatic heart failure.9,10 previous in vitro evidence showed
that carvedilol, as an oxidant scavenger, could inhibit
cardiomyocyte membrane lipid peroxidation and protect
cells from oxidant injury.11 it is further suggested that the
clinical benefits of carvedilol in cardiac protection might
be largely attributed to its antioxidant activity.9,12 recently, carvedilol was shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein oxidation in vitro13,14 and inhibit smooth muscle
cell migration, proliferation, or neointimal formation after
vascular injury in vivo.15 however, the direct mechanism
of carvedilol on endothelial protection has not been fully
clarified. we then tested the hypothesis that carvedilol may
reduce  xxxg2296xxx -␣ (tnf-␣)–induced intracellular ros production, redox-sensitive transcription pathway activation, and adhesion molecules expression, resulting in the inhibition of endothelial adhesiveness to human
mncs in vitro—an early sign of atherogenesis. these
findings may provide a novel rationale to the possible role
of carvedilol in clinical atherosclerosis disease.

n the early phase of atherogenesis, cell surface adhesion
molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
( xxxg2406xxx ), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1),
and endothelial cell selectin ( xxxg2048xxx ) could express on
endothelial cells to recruit circulating mononuclear cells
(mncs), mainly monocytes, and facilitate their binding to
endothelium and migrating to subendothelial space.1–3 reactive oxygen species (ros) may serve as a common intracellular messenger for various redox-sensitive transcription
pathways that lead to adhesion molecule expression in vascular endothelial cells.1,4,5 accumulating in vitro and in vivo
evidence showed that substances with antioxidant activity
such as  xxxd3014xxx  and  xxxd2199xxx  extract could scavenge
intracellular ros and inhibit endothelial adhesiveness to
monocytes by reducing the expression of various adhesion
molecules.6,7 however, because of the presence of significant
side effects or lack of clinical evidence, these drugs are rarely
used for human atherosclerosis disease.8

carvedilol, obtained from roche, was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  as a stock solution. 1-(isopropylamino)-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-2propanol hydrochloride (abbreviated as propranolol), a synthetic
␤-adrenergic receptor blocking agent,  xxxd3000xxx , a synthetic
␣-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, and  xxxd3014xxx , an antioxidant
that can inhibit in vivo atherosclerosis and in vitro atherogenesis,16
were used as contrast groups. propranolol,  xxxd3000xxx , and  xxxd3014xxx 
were purchased from sigma and dissolved in phosphate-buffered
saline or alcohol, respectively. before experiments, the stock reagents solutions were diluted as selected concentrated working
solution with medium 200 (cascade biologics).

propranolol (10 ␮mol/l) and  xxxd3000xxx  (10 ␮mol/l) for 18 hours in
100-mm culture dishes, then stimulated with 2 ng/ml tnf-␣ for 6
hours or 3 hours, respectively. the activated cells were scraped and
the cytoplasm total protein was extracted. the protein extracts were
applied to 10% sds-page and blotted to polyvinylidene diflouride
membrane. the blotted polyvinylidene diflouride membrane was
incubated with phosphate-buffered saline/tween-20 (0.05%) solution containing 2% skim milk for blocking nonspecific antigen and
incubated with goat anti-human  xxxg2406xxx , icam-1, or  xxxg2048xxx 
antibodies (1 ␮g/ml), respectively, at room temperature for 1 hour.
after primary antibody reaction, the membranes were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat monoclonal antibodies (0.25 ␮g/ml), detected by chemiluminescence reagent
(nen), and exposed to film (biomax mr; kodak).

methods
reagents

human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) were isolated from aortic
portion of donors by cascade biologics. cells were identified
positive for the  xxxg2423xxx  and  xxxg1724xxx  and negative for
␣-actin by immunohistochemistry. haecs were cultured in endothelial cell-supplemented medium 200 containing 2% fetal bovine
serum, 10 ng/ml human  xxxg681xxx , 3 ng/ml human
fibroblast growth factor, 10 ␮g/ml heparin, 100 u/ml penicillin,
100 pg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 ␮g/ml  xxxd164xxx . in this experiment, haecs with 2 to 8 passages were used and cells were grown
in a 5% co2 humidified atmosphere at 37°c. fresh medium was
changed every third day.

measurement of reagents cytotoxicity
the cell cytotoxicity of experimental drugs were measured by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay
(please see http://atvb.ahajournals.org).

evaluation for the viability of endothelial cells
the viability of haecs was evaluated by examining the cellular
morphology counterstained with hematoxylin and by measuring the
lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) concentration in culture medium in the
absence or presence of tnf-␣ and/or carvedilol.

haecs were pretreated with carvedilol (10 ␮mol/l) or propranolol
(10 ␮mol/l) for 18 hours and then stimulated with tnf-␣ (2 ng/ml)
for 30 minutes at 37°c before nuclear protein was extracted. the
nf-␬b oligonucleotide (5⬘-agt tga ggg gac ttt ccc agg
c-3⬘ and 3⬘-trichloroacetic acid [tca] act ccc ctg aaa ggg
tcc g-5⬘) or ap-1 oligonucleotide (5⬘-cgc ttg atg agt cag
ccg gaa-3⬘ and 3⬘- xxxg873xxx  aac tac tca gtc ggc ctt-5⬘)
(promega) were end-labeled with [␥-32p]atp (3000 ci/mmol  xxxd1891xxx 
mci/ ml). the labeled oligonucleotide could be separated from
unincorporated nucleotides by chromatography through a sephadex
g-25 spin column (pharmacia) equilibrated in te buffer. nuclear
protein extracts (20 ␮g) were incubated with 32p-labeled nf-␬b or
ap-1 consensus oligonucleotide for 20 minutes before loading to 6%
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and running the gel at room
temperature in 0.25x tbe buffer at 250 volts until the bromophenol
blue dye was below the gel. when the electrophoresis was complete,
the gel was exposed to x-ray film (biomax ms; kodak).

mnc isolation

2⬘,7⬘-dihydrodichlorofluorescin diacetate (molecular probes) was
used to measure intracellular h2o2 production in haecs. when the
studies were performed, the cells were loaded with 20 ␮mol/l of
2⬘,7⬘-dihydrodichlorofluorescin diacetate for 45 minutes after being
treated with 2 or 10 ␮mol/l of carvedilol, 5 ␮mol/l of  xxxd3014xxx , or
10 ␮mol/l of propranolol for 18 hours in 48-well plates. haecs
were washed with warm hbss 3 times and subsequently stimulated
with 2 ng/ml tnf-␣. the intracellular ros production of haecs
was counted by cytofluor 2300 (millipore) at emission of 530 nm
and absorption of 485 nm after tnf-␣ was stimulated for 10, 20, 40,
or 60 minutes.

human mncs were isolated from the peripheral venous blood in the
forearms of healthy adults. immediately after drawing blood, 30 ml
whole blood was transferred to cell preparation tubes containing 0.1
mol/l sodium citrate solution. the tubes were inverted 10 times
gently. then, the blood was centrifuged and washed with edta/
hbss solution as per operation instructions. the isolated mncs
were resuspended with rpmi 1640 medium, which was serum-free
for labeling. when the labeling procedure was completed, the
rpmi1640 medium was removed by centrifugation and the cells
were washed with edta/hbss, which contained 2 mmol/l ca2⫹,
2 mmol/l mg2⫹, and 20 mmol/l hepes. the viability of the
isolated mncs was assessed using trypan blue exclusion. there was
95% viability, at least in all samples used in these experiments. the
isolation procedures were performed at room temperature within 2
hours after the blood was drawn.

cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

mnc and endothelial cell adhesion assay

intracellular ros production assay

the detailed procedure of cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
has been previously described.6 in brief, to measure the expression of
cell surface adhesion molecules, the cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used. confluent haecs in 96-well plates were
pretreated with  xxxd3014xxx , carvedilol, propranolol,  xxxd3000xxx , or both
propranolol and  xxxd3000xxx  in the selected concentration for 18 hours
before being stimulated with 2 ng/ml tnf-␣ for the indicated time.
the expressions of  xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 were evaluated after
tnf-␣ stimulation for 6 hours and the expression of  xxxg2048xxx  was
evaluated after 3 hours of stimulation (please see
http://atvb.ahajournals.org).

western blot
western blot analysis was performed for the detection of  xxxg2406xxx ,
icam-1, or  xxxg2048xxx  expression by using goat igg. confluent
haecs were pretreated with carvedilol (10 ␮mol/l),  xxxd3014xxx 
(5 ␮mol/l), propranolol (10 ␮mol/l),  xxxd3000xxx  (10 ␮mol/l), or both

before the experiments of adhesion assay, mncs were labeled with
10 ␮mol/l 2⬘7⬘-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-56-carboxyflorescein acetoxymethyl ester (bcecf/am) (boehringer-mannheim) in serum-free
rpmi1640 medium for 45 minutes at 37°c in darkness, then the
surplus 2⬘7⬘-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-56-carboxyflorescein acetoxymethyl ester was washed with hbss. labeled mncs were added to
control or treated haecs that were confluent in 6-well plates, and
3⫻105 cells of leukocyte were added for each well. after incubation
at 37°c for 1 hour, nonabounded cells were removed with gentle
hbss washing 3 times. the degree of mnc adhesion to haecs was
counted by multilabel counter victor2 (wallace) at emission of 530
mn and absorption of 435 nm after cells were lysed with dmso.

statistical analysis
the data were expressed as the mean⫾sem and analyzed by
anova program, followed by dunnett test. p⬍0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

results
cell cytotoxicity of experimental drugs
the cell cytotoxicity of carvedilol,  xxxd3000xxx , propranolol, and
 xxxd3014xxx  were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. it was shown that the
dosage used of each drug in the following experiments did
not affect the cell viability of haecs (please see http://
atvb.ahajournals.org). furthermore, tnf-␣ or carvedilol or
both together did not impair the viability of haecs determined by the morphology of haecs and the ldh concentration in the culture medium (figure i, available online at
http://atvb.ahajournals.org).

carvedilol inhibited the adhesiveness of mncs to
tnf-␣–stimulated haecs

haecs were pretreated with 10 ␮ mol/l carvedilol,
10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3000xxx , 10 and 50 ␮mol/l propranolol, and
5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  for 18 hours before being stimulated with
2 ng/ml tnf- ␣ , then interacted with 2⬘7⬘-bis(2carboxyethyl)-56-carboxyflorescein acetoxymethyl ester–labeled mncs. the mnc binding to tnf-␣–stimulated
haecs was significantly increased as compared with control.
pretreatment with 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  or 10 ␮mol/l carvedilol, but not  xxxd3000xxx  or propanolol, significantly inhibited
mnc binding to tnf-␣--stimulated haecs. coincubated
with  xxxd3000xxx  and 10 or 50 ␮mol/l of propranolol did not
inhibit mnc adhesiveness to haecs (figure 1a to 1i). the
cells were then lysed with dmso and their relative fluorescence units were counted by fluorometer (multilabel counter
victor). as shown in figure 1j,  xxxd3014xxx  and carvedilol
significantly inhibited mnc binding to tnf-␣–stimulated
haecs by 52.1⫾6.2% and 5l.0⫾4.0% (p⬍0.05),
respectively.

carvedilol reduced tnf-␣–induced expression of
 xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx  in haecs
the effects of carvedilol on  xxxg2406xxx , icam-1, and
 xxxg2048xxx  expression on tnf-␣–stimulated haecs were
determine by cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (figure 2). high-dosage (10 ␮mol/l) but not low-dosage
(2 ␮mol/l) carvedilol significantly inhibited tnf-␣–induced
 xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx  (66⫾2% and 55⫾1%) but not
icam-1 expression (106⫾22%) in haecs. pretreatment
with 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  significantly downregulated
 xxxg2406xxx  but not icam-1 or  xxxg2048xxx  expression (79⫾5%,
104⫾2%, and 109⫾4%, respectively). pretreatment with
 xxxd3000xxx  or propranolol or both had no effects on any cell
adhesion molecule expression. the findings of cell enzymelinked immunosorbent assay were confirmed by western blot
analysis (figure 3). pretreatment with 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  or
10 ␮mol/l carvedilol significantly inhibited  xxxg2406xxx  expression, but only the latter significantly inhibited  xxxg2048xxx 
expression. tnf-␣–induced icam-1 expression was not
altered by the aforementioned treatments.

human mncs to tnf-␣–stimulated haecs. five independent
experiments gave similar results. *p⬍0.05 as compared with
tnf-␣–stimulated haecs.

ment with carvedilol significantly reduced the densities of the
nf-␬b and ap-1 shifted bands induced by tnf-␣ (figure 4).
propranolol had no such effects. supershift bands were also
performed with anti-p65 or anti-c-jun antibodies to confirm
the specific presence of bands to nf-␬b or ap-1 (figure ii,
available online at http://atvb.ahajournals.org).

carvedilol reduced intracellular ros formation
in tnf-␣–stimulated haecs

stimulation with 2 ng/ml tnf-␣ significantly increased
intracellular h2o2 production in haecs in a time-dependent
manner, beginning at 20 minutes of exposure (figure 5a and
5b). pretreatment with 2 ␮mol/l or 10 ␮mol/l carvedilol for
18 hours could reduce tnf-␣–induced h2o2 formation in
haecs. the effect of 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  was similar to that
of 10 ␮mol/l carvedilol. pretreated with 10 ␮mol/l propranolol did not alter the h2o2 production in tnf-␣–stimulated
haecs (figure 5b).

discussion
during early atherosclerosis, circulating monocytes and lymphocytes may interact with  xxxg2406xxx , whereas neutrophils
interact with icam-1 on endothelial cells to establish the
firm adhesion, a critical step of atherogenesis.17,18 in the
present study, mncs were isolated from the peripheral blood
of healthy adults for the in vitro adhesiveness of haecs,
which is similar to the firm adhesion during in vivo atherogenesis.17,18 carvedilol was shown to decrease tnf-␣–stimulated endothelial  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx  expression,
whereas  xxxd3014xxx  reduced  xxxg2406xxx  only. however, both
could inhibit endothelial adhesiveness to human mncs in a

were pretreated with 10 ␮mol/l carvedilol, 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3000xxx ,
10 ␮mol/l propranolol, and 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  for 18 hours, followed by tnf-␣ stimulation (2 ng/ml for 6 hours). the expression of  xxxg2406xxx  was reduced by  xxxd3014xxx  and by carvedilol but
not by  xxxd3000xxx  or propanolol or combination treatment. the
expression of icam-1 was not changed by either one of these
drugs. the expression of  xxxg2048xxx  was significantly reduced by
carvedilol only. three independent experiments gave similar
results. summarized data (mean⫾sem) are shown as a bar
graph from 3 separate experiments by densitometry.

similar degree. taken together,  xxxg2406xxx  may play a crucial
role in this in vitro model of atherogenesis,19 which is
compatible with our recent findings that serum level of
soluble  xxxg2406xxx , rather than soluble icam-1, was correlated to the angiographic severity of coronary artery
stenosis.20
during early atherogenesis, cytokines such as tnf-␣ may
activate membrane-bound nadph oxidase and increase
intracellular ros production, which could then activate
redox-sensitive transcriptional pathway such as nf-␬b and
induce the expression of  xxxg2406xxx  in vascular endothelial
cells.21,22 antioxidants such as probucol23 and pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate could inhibit in vitro endothelial  xxxg2406xxx 
expression by downregulating nf-␬b activation16,19,24 and
prevent in vivo atherogenesis.7,22 recent evidence also sug-

(lane b; 2 ng/ml for 30 minutes) increased the activity of nf-␬b
and ap-1 in haecs. pretreatment with 10 ␮mol/l of carvedilol
for 18 hours (lane c) inhibited the activation of nf-␬b and ap-1
stimulated by tnf-␣. pretreatment with 10 ␮mol/l of propranolol for 18 hours (lane d) had no such effects. three separate

gested that carvedilol might exert endothelial protection via
multiple mechanisms such as inhibiting low-density lipoprotein oxidation by scavenging ros,7,14 preserving intracellular
mitochondrial function by reducing excessive oxidative
stress,25 inhibiting xanthine– xxxg2431xxx -induced ldh
release, 26 enhancing vasodilatation by inhibition of
 xxxg674xxx  biosynthesis,27 stimulating endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  release through atp efflux,28 and preventing endothelial
apoptosis through modulation of fas/ xxxd3135xxx  and
caspase-3 pathway.29,30 our findings further indicated that
carvedilol could inhibit redox-sensitive transcription factor
nf-␬b and ap-1 activation in haecs. interestingly, carvedilol or  xxxd3014xxx , but not propranolol, a synthetic nonselective ␤-adrenergic receptor blocker, or  xxxd3000xxx , a synthetic
␣1-adrenergic receptor blocker, or both together, could significantly inhibit tnf-␣-stimulated adhesion molecules expression as well as endothelial adhesiveness to human mncs.
accordingly, antioxidant activity other than ␣- or ␤-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity may contribute to the antiatherogenesis effect of carvedilol.
in the present study, pretreatment with carvedilol reduced
endothelial expression of  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx , whereas
 xxxd3014xxx  only inhibited the former. thus, the redox-sensitive
nf-␬b activation, which could be inhibited by either carvedilol or  xxxd3014xxx , is critical to tnf-␣–stimulated  xxxg2406xxx 
expression.19,31,32 however, the inhibition of both nf-␬b and
ap-1 activation seems required for the inhibition of tnf-␣–
stimulated  xxxg2048xxx  expression. different from the significant increase by strong (10 ng/ml) tnf-␣ stimulation,33,34
 xxxg2048xxx  was mildly increased by 2 ng/ml of tnf-␣.35,36
recent evidence suggested that although superoxide is crucial
to tnf-␣–induced  xxxg2406xxx  expression, both superoxide and
h2o2 contribute to  xxxg2048xxx  expression in endothelial
cells.37,38 furthermore, endothelial  xxxg2048xxx  gene may present dna-binding sequences for both nf-␬b and ap-1,39 and
multiple nf-␬b binding sites in the human  xxxg2048xxx  gene
are required for maximal tnf-␣–induced expression.40 we

compared with control groups (f), tnf-␣ treatment (2 ng/ml
for 10, 20, 40, or 60 minutes) significantly increased h2o2 production in a time-dependent fashion in haecs (e) (p⬍0.05).
pretreatment with 2 ␮mol/l (䡺) or 10 ␮mol/l (ƒ) carvedilol or
5 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  (▫) significantly decreased tnf-␣–stimulated
h2o2 production in haecs. pretreatment with 10 ␮mol/l propranolol (f) did not affect tnf-␣–stimulated h2o2 production in
haecs. the data were presented with 3 independent
experiments.

then speculated that the inhibitory effect of carvedilol on
tnf-␣–induced  xxxg2048xxx  expression might be related to its
broad antioxidant capacity with the inhibition of both nf-␬b
and ap-1 activation.10,11,41 interestingly, although both nf␬b
and ap-1 action were significantly inhibited, icam-1 expression was not suppressed by carvedilol. in fact, both
redox-sensitive nf-␬b and ap-1 activation42 and redoxindependent nf-␬b activation43,44 may contribute to tnf-␣–
induced endothelial icam-1 expression. the limited effect of
carvedilol shown in the present study is compatible with the
notion that redox-independent nf-␬b activation is critical to
icam-1 expression in tnf-␣–stimulated haecs42,45 (please
see http://atvb.ahajournals.org).

carvedilol from oxygen free-radical–induced damage could
be attained at concentrations that are consistent with the
plasma levels of the drug attained in patients on a dose of 25
to 50 mg per day (ie, 100 to 300 nmol/l).45 however, it was
recently shown that carvedilol treatment failed to reduce
restenosis after directional coronary arthrectomy in patients
with coronary artery disease.46 in that study, carvedilol was
given orally 24 hours before the procedure. such duration
might not be enough for a full vascular protection of
carvedilol in vivo.31 in the present study, carvedilol was given
18 hours before tnf-␣ stimulation, which could significantly
reduce in vitro atherogenesis, suggesting that a sufficient
duration may be required for the preventive effect of carvedilol. this is compatible with the evidence that sufficient
pretreatment duration of antioxidant such as  xxxd3014xxx  is
critical to preventing restenosis after coronary intervention.47
in conclusion, carvedilol, by inhibiting the redox-sensitive
nf-␬b and ap-1 activation, may inhibit tnf-␣–stimulated
 xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx  expression and the adhesiveness of
endothelial cells to human mncs. the mechanism could be
related to its broad antioxidant activity and direct endothelial
protection, rather than ␣- and ␤-adrenergic block effects. the
findings may provide not only a novel mechanism of vascular
protection by carvedilol but also the novel rationale of its
potential implication to the prevention and treatment of
atherosclerosis diseases in humans.
