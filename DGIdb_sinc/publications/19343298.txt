abstract the introduction of targeted agents such as the
monoclonal antibodies rituximab (anti-cd20) and alemtuzumab (anti- xxxg393xxx ) has brought about a remarkable change
in the therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll).
although it is unclear whether overall survival has been
improved, the incorporation of these monoclonal antibodies
into chemoimmunotherapy regimens has dramatically
improved complete response rates and progression-free
survival in patients with both newly-diagnosed and relapsed
cll. the success of rituximab and alemtuzumab has
spurred the development of other monoclonal antibodies
targeting distinct proteins and epitopes on the surface of
cll cells and an exciting array of novel immunotherapeutics.
the judicious use of these agents provides the opportunity to
develop risk-adapted therapeutic strategies to optimize
responses and quality of life in patients with cll.

introduction
the introduction of targeted therapies in oncology afforded
investigators the opportunity for making paradigm shifts in

the way that these diseases are managed. although the
manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies was first reported
by kohler and milstein in 1975 [1], the clinical potential of
these agents in oncology has only been fully realized in
recent years. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), the
most frequently diagnosed leukemia in the western world,
and non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) are among the diseases
that have benefited from the use of monoclonal antibody
therapy. indeed, the use of these agents is one of the main
reasons why response rates and progression-free survival of
patients with cll have steadily improved over the past
10 years [2].
cll is diagnosed upon the identification of lymphocytosis exhibiting the characteristic b-cell immunophenotype
of cd5+/ xxxg375xxx +/cd20+/hla-dr+/cd23+/sigdim [3]. thus,
the  xxxg1445xxx  constitutes an appealing target for
therapy. the use of the anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody
rituximab in cll and cd20-positive nhl is a prime
example of the activity and safety of these agents and set
the stage for the development of novel agents to target bcell malignancies. alemtuzumab, a humanized lymphocytotoxic monoclonal antibody that recognizes  xxxg393xxx , has
also shown remarkable activity in patients with cll,
including those harboring del(17p13) [4], which is associated with loss of the p53 gene and confers a poor prognosis
in cll [5, 6]. in addition to cd20 and  xxxg393xxx , cll cells
express other membrane-anchored glycoproteins (e.g.  xxxg378xxx ,
cd23) that are amenable to targeting with monoclonal
antibodies. in this article we review the clinical activity of
both approved and investigational monoclonal antibodies for
the targeted treatment of cll and provide a primer of
promising novel agents still undergoing preclinical evaluation
for the treatment of this lymphoid malignancy.

approved monoclonal antibodies
rituximab
cd20, a calcium channel that interacts with the b-cell
immunoglobulin receptor complex, is expressed on the
surface of both normal and malignant b-cells but is not
present on b-cell precursors, mature plasma cells, or other
nonlymphoid normal tissues [7]. rituximab is a chimeric
murine-derived monoclonal antibody engineered by grafting
the variable regions targeting the  xxxg1445xxx  from a
murine anti-cd20 antibody (2b8) onto human constant
regions. binding of rituximab to b-cells activates complement and promotes c3b deposition on or in close proximity
to cell-bound rituximab [8]. the activity of rituximab has
been extensively documented in cll and b-cell nhl.
unlike b-cell nhl, the antigen density of cd20 on cll
cells is low. in b-cll, the expression of cd20 has been
shown to correlate linearly with the lytic response [9]. the
activity of rituximab against these malignancies is mediated
through several mechanisms of action. in addition to
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) and
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (cdc), rituximab induces
apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and sensitizes cells
to proapoptotic stimuli, which appears to be critical in
rituximab-induced cell killing [10–12] and in the effectiveness
of combining this antibody with conventional chemotherapy
in cll [13]. in vitro, the presence of surface antigens such
as  xxxg394xxx  and/or cd59, which block cdc or adcc, has
been shown to contribute to rituximab resistance. however,
results in patients have not been consistent [10].
activity and safety of single-agent rituximab therapy
rituximab was initially tested in phase i studies as a single
dose ranging from 10 to 500 mg/m2 of body-surface area
(bsa) intravenously (iv) and at doses ranging from 125 to
375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks. the optimal dose of
rituximab was never defined as the dose-limiting toxicity
was not identified [14, 15]. a regimen of 375 mg/m2

weekly for 4 weeks was empirically selected for further
testing [16–18]. this dose schedule was used in the pivotal
study that led to the approval of rituximab by the united
states food & drug administration (fda) for the
treatment of low grade nhl. although the response rate
was 50% in patients with follicular lymphoma, only 4
(13%) of 30 patients with relapsed/refractory small lymphocytic lymphoma (sll) or cll responded [19]. similar
modest results were obtained in a series of small trials in
which rituximab was used as a single-agent to treat relapsed
cll (table 1) [20–24]. it is believed that one reason for the
low response rates seen with single-agent rituximab is the
low level of cd20 expression on the surface of cll cells.
hainsworth et al administered rituximab 375 mg/m2
weekly for 4 weeks to 44 patients with previously untreated
cll/sll who had at least one indication for treatment
[25]. the overall response rate (orr) was 58% with a
complete response (cr) rate of 9%. the 2-year progressionfree survival (pfs) was 49% [25]. when given in the
frontline setting to 31 patients with cll rai stage 0–2 and
high beta2 microglobulin, rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for
8 weeks rendered an orr of 90% and a cr rate of 19% [26].
two dose-escalation studies were conducted in an
attempt to improve response rates in patients with cll.
o’brien et al tested the activity of rituximab given iv
weekly at doses up to 2250 mg/m2 in 40 patients with
previously treated cll and in 10 patients with other b-cell
leukemias; this resulted in a dose-dependent orr that
reached 75% at 2250 mg/m2 [27]. an orr of 45% was
observed among 33 patients with sll/cll who received
rituximab 375 mg/m2 three times per week for 4 weeks [28].
it was clear from these studies that rituximab was active
in cll particularly when given at high doses, but also that
its administration as single-agent was unlikely to change
the long-term prognosis of patients with cll.
rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy
based on several randomized studies in which rituximabbased chemoimmunotherapy resulted in improved orr as

well as overall survival in patients with b-cell nhl, this
monoclonal antibody was also tested in cll in combination
with different chemotherapy agents active against this
disease (table 2). the cancer and leukemia group b
(calgb) treated 104 patients with symptomatic previously
untreated cll in the study 9712 [29]. therapy consisted of
the nucleoside analog  xxxd2120xxx  (25 mg/m2 days 1 through
5 of a 28-day cycle for 6 cycles) given with (i.e., the fr
regimen) or without rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 (also on
day 4 of the first cycle), followed by rituximab 375 mg/m2
weekly for 4 weeks starting 8 weeks after completion of
 xxxd2120xxx  (fr regimen)[29]. the concurrent fr arm
rendered higher orr (90% vs 77%) as well as cr rates
(47% vs 28%) compared to the sequential arm. the median
response duration and survival had not been reached for
either regimen.
m.d. anderson cancer center evaluated the efficacy
of the fcr regimen, which consisted of  xxxd2120xxx 
25 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days,
and rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2
on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6. this regimen was administered to
177 patients with relapsed or refractory cll. therapy with
fcr was generally well tolerated and yielded an orr of
73%. cr was achieved by 25% of patients, of whom 32%
also had a complete molecular response [30]. given the
remarkable activity of fcr in heavily pretreated patients, the
next step was to test this regimen in patients with previously
untreated cll. keating et al reported the results of fcr
therapy in 300 patients with untreated cll [31]. the orr
was 95% with a remarkable cr rate of 72% [32]. the 6-year
overall (os) and failure-free survival (ffs) were 77% and
51%, respectively, with a median time to progression of
80 months [32]. a multivariate analysis of patients receiving
 xxxd2120xxx -based therapy at m.d. anderson cancer center
revealed fcr therapy to be the strongest independent
determinant of survival. despite the impressive results
obtained with the fcr regimen, this trial was a phase ii
study conducted in a single center. a trial conducted by the
german cll group compared fcr and fc. a recent press
release noted that the fcr arm had met the primary endpoint of at least a 35% prolongation of pfs. data are
expected at ash 2008.

rituximab has been combined with other purine analogues. the combination of rituximab 375 mg/m2, with
 xxxd2879xxx  4 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2,
(pcr regimen) was recently given to 46 patients (32 cll,
9 sll, 4 follicular lymphoma, 1 waldestrom’s macroglobulinemia). the patients with cll included in this trial
represented a poor prognosis group, with 78% having highrisk disease, 87% expressing  xxxg384xxx , and most of them
having failed extensive prior therapy. supportive measures
included the administration of  xxxd2106xxx  (300 µg for
patients ≤70 kg and 480 µg for patients >70 kg) sc daily
beginning 2 days after each treatment and continued until
the absolute neutrophil count exceeded 5,000/µl or 1,500/µl
for 2 days). therapy with pcr yielded an orr of 75% (cr
25%) and the median survival for the 32 patients with cll
was 44 months [33]. sixty-five symptomatic patients with
untreated cll (53% high rai risk, 71% unmutated
immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene, 34%
 xxxg384xxx +, and 34%  xxxg2438xxx +), received rituximab 375 mg/m2,
 xxxd2879xxx  2 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2
given on day 1 every 21 days for 6 cycles; the regimen was
well tolerated and resulted in an orr of 91% (cr 41%) [34].
interestingly, while 28% of patients were at least 70 years of
age, the efficacy of pcr was not significantly affected by age
or renal function [34].
alemtuzumab
alemtuzumab ( xxxd107xxx , genzyme, cambridge, ma) is
a humanized chimeric lymphocytotoxic monoclonal antibody that recognizes the antigen  xxxg393xxx , a 21- to 28-kd,
heavily glycosylated, membrane-anchored glycoprotein
which is abundantly expressed on b– and t-cells as well
as on natural killer cells, macrophages, and all cll cells
[35–37]. typically, granulocytes, platelets, erythrocytes,
and hematopoietic stem cells lack  xxxg393xxx  expression [38].
cross-linking  xxxg393xxx  on b-cell lines resulted in growth
inhibition followed by induction of apoptosis in a fas/fas
ligand-independent fashion [39].
phase i studies conducted in patients with relapsed cll
established a safe dose of 30 mg iv three times per week
for 4 to 12 weeks. in these studies, alemtuzumab was given

at 3 mg on day 1, 10 mg on day 2, 30 mg on day 3, and at
30 mg three times per week thereafter. a series of phase ii
studies have shown that alemtuzumab is effective in
patients with relapsed/refractory cll [40–44]. alemtuzumab
therapy was associated with infusion-related toxicities,
although they were generally grade 1–2 (grade 3–4 in
approximately 15%–20%), manageable with the prophylactic
use of pre-medications (i.e., acetaminophen and antihistamines, or corticosteroids), and more severe with the first
infusion. similar efficacy but markedly reduced infusionrelated events were achieved when alemtuzumab was administered subcutaneously (sc) [45, 46].
in may 2001, alemtuzumab was approved in the us and
europe as therapy for patients with b-cll refractory to
 xxxd2120xxx  on the basis of the pivotal study cam211 [41].
in this trial, 93 patients with  xxxd2120xxx -refractory cll
received alemtuzumab, which rendered an orr of 33%
with a cr rate of 2% [41]. the median time to progression
was 9.5 months and median os was 16 months. alemtuzumab was less effective in patients with adenopathy >5 cm
in diameter and patients with poor performance status [41].
unlike rituximab, alemtuzumab was very effective at
eliminating cll cells from the peripheral blood and bone
marrow, which was further corroborated in a british study
in which alemtuzumab 30 mg iv thrice weekly for up to
16 weeks was given to 91 patients with relapsed cll;
minimal residual disease (mrd) was eradicated in the bone
marrow as assessed by flow cytometry in 20% [47]. the
median treatment-free survival and os (84% at 60 months)
were significantly longer in mrd-negative patients compared
with that seen in mrd-positive responders [47]. another
distinctive feature of alemtuzumab compared to rituximab is
its activity in patients harboring del(17p13) [4], a cytogenetic
abnormality that leads to loss of the p53 gene and confers the
worst prognosis in cll [5, 6]. alemtuzumab has shown
important activity in patients with other poor prognosis
cytogenetic abnormalities such as del(11q22) [48], making it
an attractive therapeutic option for patients with high-risk
cll.
conversion from accelerated to regular fda approval
and a new labeling claim for the initial treatment of b-cll
was granted in september 2007 on the basis of results from
the cam307 study. the cam307 trial was an open-label,
international, multicenter, randomized trial designed to
demonstrate an improved pfs duration with alemtuzumab
(30 mg iv three times per week for a maximum of
12 weeks) relative to  xxxd1665xxx  (40 mg/m2 orally once
every 28 days for a maximum of 12 months) in patients
with previously untreated, rai stage i–iv cll experiencing
disease progression. a total of 297 patients were adaptively
randomized based on rai stage, age, performance status,
gender, and maximum lymph node size. based on an
intention-to-treat analysis, alemtuzumab yielded a higher

targ oncol (2009) 4:11–21

orr (83% vs 55%), cr rate (22% vs 2%), mrd
eradication rate (31% vs 0%), time to alternative treatment
(23.3 vs 14.7 months) and pfs, with a 42% reduction in risk
of progression or death (hazard ratio [hr]=0.58; p=0.0001)
[49]. benefits from alemtuzumab therapy were more
noticeable in patients with high-risk disease. of the 282
patients assessable for cytogenetic analysis, 82% had
abnormalities, including 19% with 11q deletions, 7% with
17p deletions and 14% with trisomy 12. patients with 17p
deletions who received alemtuzumab had a pfs of
10.7 months compared to 2.2 months for those who received
 xxxd1665xxx  [49]. overall response rates for these two
groups were 64% and 20%, respectively. the orr of
patients with 11q deletions was 87% and 29% in the
alemtuzumab and  xxxd1665xxx  arms, respectively, with a
pfs of 8.5 months in both arms. however, the orr for
patients with trisomy 12 was similar in both arms (83% vs
80%) [49]. grade 3–4 neutropenia and infectious complications were more frequent in the alemtuzumab arm (45% and
76%) than in the  xxxd1665xxx  arm (26% and 50%). cmv
reactivation as assessed by pcr occurred in 52% of patients
on the alemtuzumab arm. although the cam307 study
presents alemtuzumab as therapeutic option with notable
potential in the frontline setting, particularly in patients with
poor cytogenetic features, caution must be exercised when
interpreting these data given the limited follow-up and the
efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy combinations.
alemtuzumab has also shown acceptable tolerability and
high efficacy in combination with  xxxd2120xxx  (orr 83%,
cr rate 30%) [50] as well as when combined with
 xxxd2120xxx , cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (cfar
regimen; orr 65%, cr rate 24%) [51] in patients with
relapsed cll. a trial evaluating the activity of cfar in the
frontline setting is underway.
is there a role for alemtuzumab as consolidation therapy
in cll?
given the relatively low efficacy of alemtuzumab in
treating bulky lymph nodes but its high activity in
eradicating mrd from the peripheral blood and bone
marrow of cll cells, a relevant question is whether this
antibody might play an important role as consolidation
therapy in patients who have partially responded to
chemotherapy. in 2003, o’brien et al reported that 38%
of patients who had responded to prior therapy achieved a
mrd-negative marrow after receiving therapy with alemtuzumab as assessed by two-color flow cytometry (table 3)
[52]. after a median follow-up of 18 months, 6 patients
remained disease-free and the median time to progression
had not been reached [52]. similar results were observed by
wendtner et al in 2004 [53] and by moreton et al in 2005
[47]. wendter et al conducted a randomized phase iii study

in which 23 patients with cll responding to initial
chemotherapy with  xxxd2120xxx  (f) or  xxxd2120xxx  in
combination with cyclophosphamide (fc) were randomized
to receive treatment with alemtuzumab (30 mg iv three
times per week for 12 weeks or observation). consolidation
with alemtuzumab was associated with an increased incidence of severe infections and myelotoxicity. of the 21
assessable patients, 11 were randomized to receive alemtuzumab and severe infections were observed in 7 of them,
which included life-threatening pulmonary aspergillosis
(n=1), grade 3 cmv reactivation (n=4), pulmonary tuberculosis (n=1), and herpes zoster (n=1). this high incidence of
severe infection led to the premature closing of the trial. two
of 11 patients in the alemtuzumab arm converted from pr to
cr and 5 of 6 assessable patients eradicated mrd in
peripheral blood while all patients in the observation arm
remained mrd-positive [53]. moreton et al administered
alemtuzumab to 91 patients for a median of 9 weeks and
36% had a cr, including 20% (n=18) who achieved mrdnegative status by flow cytometry. the most striking finding
in this study was that patients with cr and no evidence of
mrd by flow cytometry had not reached median overall
survival, in contrast with those who had a cr but exhibited
mrd positivity in whom the overall survival was 60 months
[47].
in the calgb 19901 study, 56 patients with previously
untreated cll received single-agent  xxxd2120xxx  25 mg/m2
iv daily days 1 through 5 of a 28-day cycle for 4 cycles.
patients who achieved stable disease or better after 2 months
of observation (n=36) received alemtuzumab 30 mg iv
three times per week for 6 weeks. another 24 patients
received the same  xxxd2120xxx  regimen, but received
alemtuzumab sc if a response was achieved (n=18) [54].
fifteen (42%) of the 36 patients receiving iv alemtuzumab
improved to cr and 18 (50%) had pr for an overall
improvement of response rate of 92%. of the 18 patients
receiving sc alemtuzumab, 12 (66%) improved their
response, including 22% who achieved cr and 44% who
achieved pr [54]. similar results were observed in a
smaller study reported by montillo et al in 2006 [55],
further strengthening the role of alemtuzumab as a viable
option for the management of residual disease in the
consolidation setting.
the calgb 10101 is addressing the activity of
consolidation therapy with alemtuzumab sc in patients
with cll receiving the fr regimen [56]. in this phase ii
study, 51 previously untreated symptomatic patients with
cll received the fr regiment every 28 days for up to 6
cycles. three months after the last dose of  xxxd2120xxx ,
patients with stable or responsive disease received consolidation therapy with sc alemtuzumab 3 mg on day 1,
10 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 5, and 30 mg thrice weekly
thereafter for 6 weeks. an interim safety analysis of 51

targ oncol (2009) 4:11–21

patients disclosed that unacceptable toxicity after alemtuzumab was higher in patients in cr (47%) than in those in
pr (26%). in addition, there were 2 deaths in pr patients
and 5 in cr patients from a variety of infections including
viral meningitis, cmv pneumonia, legionella pneumonia,
listeria meningitis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and
epstein-barr virus (ebv) lymphoproliferative disorder
[56]. enrollment to the cr arm was halted. no efficacy
data was presented. in the phase ii trials of alemtuzumab
consolidation reporting infectious complications it is noteworthy that the median interval between completion of
chemotherapy and initiation of alemtuzumab was 4–
6 months. in contrast, both the german and the calgb
trial had a shorter interval of 2–3 months between treatments.
an effective interval to allow some immune recovery after
 xxxd2120xxx -based therapy may be important in minimizing
complications of alemtuzumab consolidation.
combination immunotherapy with rituximab
and alemtuzumab
the rationale for combining alemtuzumab and rituximab is
several-fold: a) both monoclonal antibodies target different
antigens on the surface of b-cells and could have different
mechanisms of action; b) alemtuzumab has proven very
efficacious at depleting cll cells that are circulating and in
the bone marrow, while rituximab is effective against cll
cells in the lymph nodes; c) the activity of rituximab in
cll may be complemented by the activity of alemtuzumab
in patients with 17p13- or p53 gene mutation who are
typically resistant to purine analogues; d) the favorable
toxicity profiles of these antibodies.
in 2003, faderl et al reported on the activity and safety
of rituximab in combination with alemtuzumab in 48
patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies,
including 32 with cll, 9 with cll/prolymphocytic
leukemia, 1 with pll, 4 with mantle cell lymphoma, and
2 with richter transformation [57]. therapy consisted of
rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks and
alemtuzumab given at the loading-dose schedule of 3 mg,
10 mg, and 30 mg on 3 consecutive days during the first
week of treatment, followed by a dose of 30 mg on days 3
and 5 of weeks 2 to 4. although patients could receive a
second 28-day cycle, depending on their response and
tolerability to the first cycle, only 7 (15%) did so [57]. the
overall response rate was higher than that previously
reported with alemtuzumab given as single-agent [41].
responses were observed in 25 (52%) patients, including 4
(8%) with cr, 2 (4%) with nodular partial response (pr),
and 19 (40%) with pr. the overall response rate among the
32 patients with cll was 63%, which included 2 patients
who achieved cr and 16 who achieved pr. after a median
follow-up of 6.5 months (range, 1–20 months), the median

targ oncol (2009) 4:11–21

time to progression was 6 months and the median overall
survival was 11 months. notably, almost complete clearance
of cll cells was observed in the peripheral blood while this
was documented in 40% to 70% of cases in the bone
marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen or liver. the combination
was generally well tolerated, with most toxicities being grade
1 or 2, and typically infusion-related. infection was reported
in 52% of patients while cmv antigenemia occurred in 27%
of patients but it was symptomatic and required therapy in
only 15%. overall, these results suggested that the combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab was active and
associated with an acceptable toxicity profile in patients
with poor prognosis cll.
the combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab was
evaluated in patients with earlier stage, high-risk cll by
investigators at the mayo clinic [58]. this combination
may be a good initial step for the management of patients
with high-risk cll based on the presence of poor risk
biologic features. in this study, 30 newly diagnosed patients
with at least one marker of high-risk disease (17p13-,
11q22-, or a combination of unmutated igvh and  xxxg384xxx +/
 xxxg2438xxx +) were treated with sc alemtuzumab with dose
escalation (3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg) over 3 consecutive days,
and then received 30 mg daily 3 days per week. rituximab
was given intravenously at 375 mg/m2 on day 8 and then
repeated weekly for 4 weeks. overall, 27 (90%) patients
responded, including 11 cr, 10 nodular pr, and 6 pr. six
(29%) of the 21 patients with either cr or nodular pr had
complete eradication of mrd as assessed by 3-color flow
cytometry, which detects 1:10 cll cells. the median
duration of response was 14.4 months (range, 9.3–22.5).
nineteen (63%) patients experienced disease progression
and 1 patient died of complications from allogeneic stem
cell transplantation. however, 4 of the patients in cr with
mrd-negative status were progression-free after a median
of 30.2 months (range, 15.3–32.3), underscoring the critical
importance of the depth of response in long-term outcomes.
although the combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab is
a promising option for high-risk patients, it is not curative
and most patients receiving this treatment eventually
progress [58]. it will be interesting to determine whether
the activity of this combination will be further improved by
the addition of  xxxd2120xxx  or other new agents.

other monoclonal antibodies in clinical development
a series of novel monoclonal antibodies with specificity
against a variety of antigens on the surface of b-cells are
currently undergoing evaluation. among the latter, lumilixumab (anti-cd23) and  xxxd2771xxx  (anti-cd20) are the
furthest along in clinical development.

17

lumiliximab
lumiliximab (idec-152) is a primatized chimeric monoclonal antibody with human igg1 constant regions and
macaque variable regions directed against cd23, a 45-kd
low-affinity ige receptor expressed on most cll cells. in
vitro studies have shown that lumiliximab induces apoptosis
in cd23-expressing lymphoid cell lines [59, 60], an effect
that was enhanced by  xxxd2120xxx  and rituximab [61]. in a
dose-finding study, 46 patients with previously treated (4
median prior therapies) and refractory cll were assigned
sequentially to receive lumiliximab at 125, 250, or 375 mg/m2
weekly for 4 weeks; 500 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks;
500 mg/m2 thrice during week 1, then 500 mg/m2 weekly for
the following 3 weeks; or 500 mg/m2 thrice a week for
4 weeks [62]. grade 3–4 toxicity occurred in 15% of patients
and was unrelated to lumiliximab dose. the mtd of
lumiliximab was not reached. although no pr or cr
occurred, a decrease in peripheral lymphocytosis was
observed in 91% of patients (greater than 50% in 28% of
patients) and nodal reduction was reported in 52% of
patients. lumiliximab accumulated at doses greater than
250 mg/m2, a dose at which saturation of cd23 receptors
occurred, being maintained for 1 week following completion
of therapy at 375 mg/m2. lumiliximab exhibited a median
terminal half-life of 7 days. lumiliximab 50 mg/m2 and
325 or 450 mg/m2 on days 2 and 4 of cycle 1 and 375 or
500 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6 was given in
combination with the fcr to 31 patients with relapsed cll
[63]. twenty patients (65%) experienced grade 3–4 toxicity,
primarily hematologic. the orr was 71%, and 52% of
patients achieved a cr. based on these promising results, a
randomized phase iii study comparing fcr alone to the
combination of fcr and lumiliximab is underway.
 xxxd2771xxx 
 xxxd2771xxx  (humax cd20, genmab, copenhagen,
denmark) is a high-affinity, fully humanized monoclonal
igg1 antibody directed to an epitope on cd20 closer to the
cell membrane and different from the rituximab binding
epitope. in this manner,  xxxd2771xxx  binds cd20 with
increased stability, thus reducing its off-rate and enhancing
its capacity to induce cdc. the fact that  xxxd2771xxx  binds
cd20 ensures that complement fixation occurs closer to the
site of action and further away from c1-inhibitor [64]. in fact,
 xxxd2771xxx  could induce complement-mediated lysis of
rituximab-resistant cells [65].  xxxd2771xxx  has been shown
to be safe and active in cll. in a phase i/ii study, 12 of 26
relapsed patients who had received 4 weekly infusions of up
to 2,000 mg of  xxxd2771xxx  responded [66]. time to
progression and time to next therapy was 161 and 366 days,
respectively, which correlated with the area under the curve

targ oncol (2009) 4:11–21

of  xxxd2771xxx  [66]. a non-randomized phase iii registration
trial (nct00349349) in patients with cll who progressed
after  xxxd2120xxx  and alemtuzumab or who are refractory to
 xxxd2120xxx  and have bulky adenopathy is underway. a
recent press release noted that interim analysis revealed
a 51% response rate in the double refractory group and a
similar response rate of 44% in the group with bulky lymph
nodes. presentation of these data is expected at ash 2008. a
phase ii study of  xxxd2771xxx  combined with cyclophosphamide and  xxxd2120xxx  in previously untreated patients
recently completed accrual.

mdx-1411 are monoclonal antibodies that target cd40
and cd70, respectively; they are being evaluated in ongoing
phase i trials for patients with cll.
in addition to classic monoclonal antibodies, several
novel immunotherapeutics potentially useful for the treatment
of cll are currently in early stages of development. among
the latter, are bispecific monoclonal antibodies with specificity
for both cd20 and  xxxg378xxx  [74], small modular immunopharmaceuticals targeting cd37, a glycoprotein strongly expressed
on the surface of cll cells, and t-cell engaging antibodies
such as  xxxd351xxx  (mt103/ xxxd351xxx ), which target
 xxxg375xxx  and cd3 simultaneously and are currently undergoing
evaluation in phase i clinical trials [75].

other monoclonal antibodies
a variety of monoclonal antibodies with different specificities
is in different stages of preclinical or early clinical investigation (table 4). some of the latter have been designed, like
rituximab, to target the cd20 surface antigen. one such
antibody is ame-133, an igg1 with high specificity for
cd20 whose fc region is binds cd16 ( xxxg775xxx ) with high
affinity, thus improving its ability to activate nk cells [67].
 xxxd2765xxx  is a humanized anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody
with high affinity for fcrgammaiii, which results in enhanced
adcc and strong caspase-independent apoptosis activity
upon cd20 binding [68].veltuzumab (ha20) is another
humanized igg1kappa monoclonal antibody that, despite targeting
the same cd20 epitope as rituximab [69], has shown clinical
activity at lower doses than the latter [70].  xxxd2015xxx , an
anti- xxxg378xxx  monoclonal antibody of the igg1(kappa) class has
activity as a single-agent [71] and also in combination with
rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or
refractory indolent b-cell nhl [72]. apolizumab (hu1d10;
remitogen) is a monoclonal antibody designed to target the
hla drß chain [73], which is present in 80%–90% of cll
cases. the activity of apolizumab is currently being tested
in patients with relapsed/refractory cll. hcd122 and

conclusion
despite steady improvements in patient outcomes over the
last decade, current data suggest that none of currently
available therapies for cll have proven curative. however,
cll therapy has greatly benefited from the development of
a variety of targeted agents. rituximab, a monoclonal
antibody directed towards the cd20 surface antigen,
represents the most important advance in the treatment of
this disease in recent years. although we await data from
the phase iii confirmatory trials, the fcr regimen, which
combines rituximab with  xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide
is arguably the most effective regimen for the treatment of
cll. the identification of other antigens on cll cells has
spurred the development of a multitude of monoclonal
antibodies in an attempt to target cll cells in a more
effective manner. some of them, such as alemtuzumab (anticd52) have already shown remarkable activity in cll.
many others, currently undergoing preclinical or early
clinical development, have shown improved cll-killing
activity compared to rituximab in vitro. ongoing trials will
establish whether these preclinical results translate into an

enhanced in vivo activity. in addition, a slew of novel
immunotherapeutics adds another layer of refinement and
complexity to the development of cll therapies. agents
such as the bispecific monoclonal antibodies and t-cell
engaging antibodies exploit distinct mechanisms of action in
an attempt to improve on current agents regarding clinical
activity and tolerability in the treatment of cll and other bcell malignancies. while the development and final approval
of these agents will obviously augment the cll therapeutic
repertoire, the critical challenge ahead will be selecting the
most effective amongst these agents and combining them in
a rational manner either amongst themselves or with
effective chemotherapeutic regimens to optimize current
cll outcomes.
