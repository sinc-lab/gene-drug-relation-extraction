abstract. the development of topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (cais) is a significant
recent achievement in glaucoma medical treatment.  xxxd367xxx , the newest topical cai, exhibits
selectivity, high affinity, and potent inhibitory activity for the carbonic anhydrase type ii isozyme ( xxxg293xxx ), which is involved in aqueous humor secretion. these characteristics, along with good ocular bioavailability, make  xxxd367xxx  maximally effective in lowering intraocular pressure (iop) by locally
inhibiting  xxxg293xxx  in the ciliary processes and suppressing aqueous humor secretion. notable among its
attributes as a safe and efficacious glaucoma drug is  xxxd367xxx ’s superior ocular comfort profile
because of its optimized suspension formulation at physiologic ph. the degree of tolerability in the eye
is considered an important determinant of a patient’s willingness to comply with the dosing regimen for
a long-term glaucoma medication. results from the preclinical pharmacologic evaluation of  xxxd367xxx  indicated that it acts specifically to inhibit ca without significant other pharmacologic actions that
could introduce undesired side effects. moreover, the typical side effects associated with systemically
administered cais are expected to occur at a lower incidence or not occur at all with  xxxd367xxx , as
its therapeutic dose and low systemic absorption do not produce a problematic level of systemic ca
inhibition.  xxxd367xxx ’s long tissue half-life in the eye, particularly in the iris–ciliary body, favors a
prolonged duration of iop lowering. this was substantiated in clinical trials, which showed that twicedaily  xxxd367xxx  provides as significant an iop reduction as three-times-daily  xxxd367xxx  or  xxxd1931xxx  in a relatively high percentage of patients.  xxxd367xxx  has been shown by the laser doppler
flowmetry technique to improve blood flow to the optic nerve head in pigmented rabbits after topical
administration, without producing an increase of blood pco2, indicating a potential for a local vasodilatory effect involving the optic nerve head circulation. the mean concentration of  xxxd367xxx  found
in the retina of pigmented rabbits (0.338 mg equivalents/g) after a single dose of 14c- xxxd367xxx  is
sufficient to inhibit  xxxg293xxx . these data suggest that topical  xxxd367xxx  could improve the blood flow in
the optic nerve head in humans should it inhibit carbonic anhydrase in that vascular bed.  xxxd367xxx 
is a new topically active cai that is safe and efficacious for reducing intraocular pressure. it offers the
convenience of topical dose administration and greater freedom from side effects related to the inhibition of ca seen with the systemic administration of cais. its formulation has been optimized to provide
greater comfort upon instillation, and this can result in a higher compliance rate by the patient. results
of studies in animals show that  xxxd367xxx  has promise for increasing blood flow to the optic nerve
head; however, this requires further assessment in the clinic.  xxxd367xxx  represents a significant technical achievement and an important addition to the medical treatment of glaucoma as both a primary
and an adjunctive drug. (surv ophthalmol 44 [suppl 2]:s119–s129, 2000. © 2000 by elsevier science

carbonic anhydrase (ca) was first described 65
years ago as the enzyme in blood that catalyzes the
reversible hydration of carbon dioxide involved in
the formation of hydrogen ion and bicarbonate anion.38 in the ciliary processes, bicarbonate anions
move with sodium ions across the epithelial cell
membrane to create the osmotic gradient that drives

aqueous humor secretion. eight years after the enzyme was discovered, sulfanilamide was reported to
inhibit its activity.29 in 1950 there were reports on
the synthesis and activity of heterocyclic sulfonamides as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (cais).39,42
acetazolamide was the first of these potent cais to
be developed pharmaceutically. at that time it was

suggested that reducing aqueous humor secretion
might provide an effective means of lowering intraocular pressure (iop) to treat glaucoma.18 shortly
thereafter, other findings prepared the way for the
use of the more potent sulfonamide cais to inhibit
carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes and to
suppress aqueous secretion.23,49 subsequently, the renal effects of acetazolamide were described and it
became the first useful diuretic drug of this class.33
after that, reports began to appear in the ophthalmic literature wherein acetazolamide administered systemically to glaucoma patients was observed
to produce a decrease in iop.6,8,20 an iop-lowering
effect in both nephrectomized and normal rabbits
and the accompanying decrease in the posterior
chamber aqueous humor bicarbonate concentration
in rabbits and guinea pigs treated with a cai was
also shown, indicating its local site of action.4,5 moreover, the reduction of bicarbonate entry into the
posterior chamber that accompanied ca inhibition
was demonstrated.24 sodium transport into the rabbit posterior chamber was shown again recently to
be reduced by the cai  xxxd2592xxx , as was aqueous flow into the posterior chamber.31
acetazolamide was the first drug of this class to be
used to lower iop by systemic administration. the
ophthalmic use of other cais, such as  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx , and  xxxd1872xxx , followed shortly thereafter. an impetus for the investigation of then-available cais for topical efficacy to lower
iop was the relatively high incidence of side effects
and adverse events that resulted from their systemic
administration at doses effective for lowering iop.
fewer than one third of patients were able to tolerate
systemic cais for longer than 1 month. it was particularly troublesome because it most commonly resulted
in discontinuation of therapy and was the symptom
complex consisting of malaise, fatigue, weight loss,
depression, anorexia, and loss of libido.17,19 thus,
poor patient tolerability and its effect on compliance
have placed these agents in a secondary or tertiary
role among drugs to treat glaucoma.
the earliest attempts to reduce iop by administering then-available cais topically were unsuccessful
because of insufficient enzyme inhibition and/or ocular bioavailability. years later, a concerted effort by
researchers in the pharmaceutical industry, academic scientists, and ophthalmic investigators demonstrated the feasibility of achieving topical efficacy
for lowering iop.32 this paved the way for the discovery and development of clinically useful topical
cais for treatment of glaucoma.30  xxxd1931xxx  was
the first of these drugs to be marketed for ophthalmology.15  xxxd367xxx  is the newest topical cai to
be successfully developed and marketed.
in general, sulfonamide cais inhibit the enzyme

desantis

with high specificity and in a noncompetitive and reversible manner. the currently available cais show
little or no inhibitory activity against other enzymes
and do not act on a variety of receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones. cais vary according
to their affinity (ki) of binding to a particular ca
isozyme, potency (ic50) for inhibiting that isozyme,
and physicochemical properties, which can influence their tissue distribution and scope of activity.
the ocular pharmacology of inhibitors of human
ca isozyme type ii ( xxxg293xxx ), the cytosolic isozyme in
the secretory ciliary epithelial cells, is to suppress
aqueous humor secretion and lower the iop.50  xxxd367xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx  are most potent against
 xxxg293xxx , with less activity against  xxxg295xxx , followed by
 xxxg287xxx .  xxxg295xxx  is the membrane-bound isozyme of ca
also found in the ciliary processes, but its contribution to aqueous humor secretion is unclear at this
time.34,35 the ic50 values for acetazolamide,  xxxd2058xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx , and  xxxd367xxx  against
 xxxg295xxx  are all similar and, generally, are an order of
magnitude less than those for  xxxg293xxx . the clinical significance of this relative to efficacy for lowering iop
and producing side effects is not known.
oral acetazolamide has been demonstrated by
aqueous fluorophotometry to decrease aqueous humor flow in normal subjects.13 subsequently, it was
reported that oral acetazolamide, but not topical
 xxxd3377xxx , reduces aqueous flow in subjects
during sleep, when flow is physiologically decreased
compared to the awake state.37,47 oral acetazolamide
and topical  xxxd1931xxx  were recently reported to
reduce aqueous humor flow in human subjects by
30% and 17%, respectively.36 there was an additional 16% decrease of flow when acetazolamide was
added to  xxxd1931xxx . these results are in contrast
to those from a more recent report that shows that
either oral acetazolamide or topical  xxxd1931xxx 
alone gives maximum reduction of iop and aqueous
humor flow in patients with ocular hypertension or
primary open-angle glaucoma.43 based on the earlier
results and the fact that systemic acidosis can lower
the iop, the speculation was that the systemic acidosis produced by oral acetazolamide, but not topical
 xxxd1931xxx , contributed to its greater iop reduction. the relative efficacy of  xxxd367xxx  1% has
been compared to that of  xxxd1931xxx  2% for suppressing aqueous humor flow in normal volunteers
by means of aqueous fluorophotometry. reductions
of daytime flow by  xxxd367xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx 
were 19% and 14%, respectively, and of nighttime
flow, 16% and 8%, respectively. thus, these two
agents produce comparable reductions in aqueous
humor flow when given in their respective clinical
concentrations.22
the additivity of topical cai to topical beta-blocker

preclinical overview of  xxxd367xxx 

relative to suppression of aqueous humor flow has
been studied. a study in healthy volunteers comparing topical  xxxd1931xxx  with topical  xxxd3377xxx  showed
that  xxxd1931xxx  reduced aqueous flow by 18% and
 xxxd3377xxx  by 47%.48 when either drug was added to the
other, the incremental increase in flow suppression
was comparable to the effect of the added drug when
given alone. thus, the flow-suppressant effects of
 xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx  given acutely were found to
be additive, and together these two drugs produced a
55% decrease of flow. the effects of  xxxd1931xxx  and
 xxxd3377xxx  on iop were consistent with their effects on
flow. an effect of cais on tonographic outflow facility
has not be demonstrated.25,26,28

physical and chemical characteristics
of  xxxd367xxx 
 xxxd367xxx , also known as  xxxd367xxx , is the r-(1)
enantiomer of 4-ethylamino-3,4-dihydro-2-(3-methoxypropyl)-2h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2-thiazine-6-sulfonamide, 1,1-dioxide, a thienothiazine sulfonamide with
a free amine and a molecular weight of 383.51.21 its
aqueous solubilities are 0.9% (ph 5) and 0.05% (ph
7.4). it forms a suspension at physiologic ph.21  xxxd367xxx ’s octanol/water (o/w) distribution coefficient at ph 5 is 0.7, whereas at the physiologic ph,
7.4, it is a relatively high 6.6. under the same conditions (ph 7.4), the o/w distribution coefficients of
 xxxd1931xxx  and acetazolamide were determined to
be 1.72 and 0.23, respectively, whereas their aqueous
solubilities were found to be 0.67% and 0.21%, respectively.21 thus,  xxxd367xxx  is more lipophilic
than either  xxxd1931xxx  or acetazolamide at physiologic ph, where acetazolamide exists in its charged
form and  xxxd1931xxx  is uncharged. higher lipophilicity favors the ability to move across lipid membrane barriers.16  xxxd367xxx ’s pka values are 5.9
(amine) and 8.4 (primary sulfonamide), allowing it
to act as an acid or a base (ampholyte) depending
upon the ph.21 the relatively high pka of the primary sulfonamide is considered to render  xxxd367xxx  less reactive with glutathione under normal
physiologic conditions, rendering it less likely to undergo a similar reaction with a macromolecular nucleophile, which could produce an allergen in
vivo.11,51 at a ph of 7.0 to 7.4,  xxxd367xxx  has very
low water solubility, which results in its being a suspension at physiologic ph, making it more comfortable in the eye because less drug is in solution.

general pharmacology of  xxxd367xxx 
the principal pharmacologic activity of  xxxd367xxx  is carbonic anhydrase inhibition.  xxxd367xxx , its other isomer (antipode) and its desethyl
(major) metabolite, did not produce any significant

s121

displacement of known ligands in vitro from binding
sites related to 34 common physiologic receptors
and enzymes that might contribute to side effects or
ancillary pharmacology.
groups of 10 male sprague-dawley rats, 150–250
g, were given single doses of  xxxd367xxx , 1, 10,
and 30 mg/kg, or 0.9% saline solution, intravenously, and their behavior was observed during a 24hour period. no neurologic signs related to treatment were observed to occur. in a separate group of
four male rats, 30 mg/kg of  xxxd367xxx  intravenously (iv), produced protection from maximal
electroshock in 50% of the animals, indicating an
anticonvulsant effect of  xxxd367xxx  at this dose
level. when administered orally to cd-1 strain male
mice (10 males per group),  xxxd367xxx  dosages of
0, 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg, did not produce a neurologic deficit as measured by rotarod motor performance at 30 or 60 minutes after dose administration.
each 30-ml drop of the product delivers approximately 0.3 mg, which, in a person weighing 50 kg,
equals 0.006 mg/kg. thus, 30 mg/kg is a 5,000-fold
multiple of this dose.
in anesthetized dogs given artificial respiration
(two male and two female dogs weighing 9.1–11.6
kg), receiving iv infusions of 10 mg/kg of  xxxd367xxx  or 0.9% saline solution over 15 minutes, there
was no significant change in the cardiovascular responses to epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, or  xxxd2401xxx ; moreover, a statistically significantly (p # 0.05) reduced blood pressure response
(3–mm hg change) to histamine was without biological significance. no biologically significant changes
in blood gas pco2, po2, or blood ph occurred. no
significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure
or heart rate were noted in this study, nor did the
lead ii electrocardiogram waveform change compared with predose recordings (alcon research,
ltd., data on file).
the potential for effects of intravenous infusion
of  xxxd367xxx  at 1 and 10 mg/kg over 15-minute
periods on cardiac and circulatory function was investigated in anesthetized dogs, two males and two
females weighing 9.0–11.2 kg, receiving artificial respiration. effects were compared with pretreatment
baseline values and to 0.9% saline solution control
conditions. directly measured parameters were evaluated every minute during infusion and at 5-minute
intervals for a minimum of 30 minutes after infusion
ended. no biologically significant effects on cardiac
or circulatory function were observed after administration of saline or  xxxd367xxx  at 1 mg/kg.  xxxd367xxx  dosages of 10 mg/kg iv, did produce an
increase by more than 20% in the cardiac output,
1dp/dt, and contractile force (alcon research
ltd., data on file).

four groups of 10 male cd-1 mice each were
given an oral dose of 0.25%  xxxd2609xxx  vehicle
or 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg of  xxxd367xxx  to examine
the potential effects on gastrointestinal propulsion
of a charcoal meal during a 30-minute period after
dosing.  xxxd367xxx  dosages of 30 mg/kg, produced a 44% reduction in intestinal charcoal meal
progression, but 1 and 10 mg/kg produced 8% and
18% decreases, respectively. the 44% decrease was
statistically significant (p # 0.05), as compared with
the vehicle control result (alcon research, ltd.,
data on file).
five groups of 10 male sprague-dawley rats each,
weighing 180–250 g, were hydrated with 25 ml/kg
of saline (orally) and injected intravenously with
0.9% saline solution, 0.3, 1, 10, or 3 mg/kg of  xxxd367xxx , or 5 mg/kg of acetazolamide. four hours
after administration of the control or drug treatment, the urine volume, ph, and urinary electrolyte
concentrations were analyzed.  xxxd367xxx  at 0.3
mg/kg was without effect on measured parameters.
at 1 mg/kg,  xxxd367xxx  produced increases in
urine volume, ph, [na1], and [k1], but a decrease
in [cl2]. urine ph and [k1] increases were statistically significant (p # 0.05).  xxxd367xxx  at 3 mg/
kg produced an increase in urine volume, ph,
[na1], and [k1], a decrease in [cl2], and an increase in po2 and pco2, but not blood ph. these
changes were statistically significant (p # 0.05). acetazolamide significantly increased urine ph, [na1],
and [k1] and decreased [cl2]. urine volume was
also increased by acetazolamide (alcon research,
ltd., data on file).
the potential for an effect of  xxxd367xxx  on
sleep time induced by pentobarbital sodium was
studied in male cd-1 mice. oral doses of  xxxd367xxx  of 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg prolonged barbiturate
sleep time by 57%, 15%, and 35%, respectively. this
effect was not considered to be biologically significant, as known active agents affect sleep duration to
a far greater degree (alcon research, ltd., data on
file).
taken together, the results of these general pharmacologic studies imply a high order of safety and
low incidence of side effects for  xxxd367xxx , and
this has been borne out in clinical trials in humans.

carbonic anhydrase inhibition and
binding in vitro
the ic50 values for inhibition of human ca
isozymes i, ii, and iv were determined by means of a
ph stat assay similar to that published previously.27,40
compounds tested included  xxxd367xxx , its s-(2)
isomer,  xxxd367xxx  desethyl metabolite,  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx  desethyl metabolite, and acet-

azolamide. enzyme was incubated with the inhibitor
for 4 minutes at 58c and throughout the 4-minute
assay, also at 58c. binding affinity constants (ki)
were determined for  xxxd367xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx ,
 xxxd1931xxx , and acetazolamide for  xxxg287xxx  and  xxxg293xxx 
by means of a  xxxd550xxx  fluorescence competitive inhibition assay
at a temperature of 378c and ph 7.4.7,10,45 these ic50
and ki values are given in table 1.
the r-(1) isomer of  xxxd367xxx  was selected as
the active ingredient for the product, as it is more
potent than the s-(2) isomer. the s-(2) isomer of
 xxxd367xxx  has 1/35th the affinity of the r-(1)
enantiomer for  xxxg293xxx .  xxxd367xxx  has its highest
affinity (ki 5 0.13 nm) and inhibitory potency (ic50 5
3.19 nm) for  xxxg293xxx , which is responsible for aqueous
humor secretion. it has 246 times higher affinity and
428 times greater inhibitory potency for  xxxg293xxx  than
for  xxxg287xxx , which is present in red blood cells (rbcs).
the affinity (ki) values for  xxxg293xxx  determined for  xxxd1931xxx  and acetazolamide were 0.51 nm and 33.8
nm, respectively, giving them less affinity for the enzyme compared to  xxxd367xxx . thus, the affinity
of  xxxd367xxx  for  xxxg293xxx  in this assay is approximately fourfold higher than that of  xxxd1931xxx  and
2.5-fold higher than that of  xxxd2058xxx . ki values
against  xxxg295xxx  were not determined; however, the
ic50 values against  xxxg295xxx  were comparable for  xxxd367xxx  (45.3 nm),  xxxd2058xxx  (22.1 nm),  xxxd1931xxx  (32.0 nm), and acetazolamide (33.1 nm).
binding constants were determined at physiologic
temperature and ph, and are believed to be more
representative of the relative inhibitory potencies
against carbonic anhydrase in vivo. this is based on
the fact that the binding of  xxxd367xxx  is mostly
hydrophobic, and hydrophobic interactions like
these increase with temperature.12,41

intraocular pressure lowering in vivo
 xxxd367xxx ’s iop effect was studied with use of
dutch-belted pigmented rabbits and cynomolgus
monkeys with ocular hypertension induced by argon
laser trabeculoplasty.14 the dutch-belted rabbit is a
strain of pigmented rabbit that, compared to new
zealand albino rabbits, exhibits spontaneous ocular
hypertension and a robust iop response to topical
cais. the rabbit required higher doses of cai than
the monkey for a given level of iop decrease. monkeys were trained to undergo the iop measurement
procedure without sedation or central nervous system anesthesia. experiments in both models employed the pneumatonometer to measure iop under
local anesthesia only, with proparacaine ophthalmic
solution diluted 1:5.
when administered as two drops of 0.025 ml
each,  xxxd367xxx  ophthalmic suspension lowered

iop in dutch-belted pigmented rabbits in a dosedependent manner with an onset within 0.5 hour
and a peak response by 1–2 hours (fig. 1). the following dose levels were studied: 0.5% (0.25 mg), 1%
(0.5 mg), and 2% (1 mg). mean baseline iop
ranged from 31.4 to 33 mm hg for all experimental
groups. iop in the  xxxd367xxx -treated eye was lowered significantly (p , 0.05) below that in the untreated contralateral eye at all dose levels studied
and at all times throughout the 6-hour experiment.
the percent change from baseline iop (treated eye
minus control eye as a percentage of baseline iop)
produced by  xxxd367xxx  0.5% suspension was statistically significant; however, it was significantly less
than the change produced by  xxxd367xxx  2%.
peak percentage decreases (average of two experiments) in iop from baseline were 11.8%, 21.6%,
and 24.8% for 0.5%, 1%, and 2%  xxxd367xxx , respectively. the lack of a significant iop change in
the contralateral untreated eyes implies that the
amount of  xxxd367xxx  absorbed systemically was
insufficient to inhibit ca in that eye. the administration of 0.5 mg of  xxxd367xxx  intravenously to
this same strain of rabbits failed to produce a significant decrease in iop. thus, it is concluded that the
iop effect from the topical administration of at least
1 mg of  xxxd367xxx  is caused by its local action on
carbonic anhydrase and not systemic absorption of
the drug.
the influence of formulation viscosity on the topical efficacy of  xxxd367xxx  1% suspension over the
range of 1 to 5,000 centipoise was investigated in the
rabbit model. whereas the efficacy of  xxxd367xxx 
was improved at 200 centipoise compared to 1 centipoise (23.1% versus 16.8% iop decrease, respectively), only slight and nonsignificant improvement
in efficacy was obtained with a further viscosity increase to 5,000 centipoise (23.4% iop decrease).
the viscosity of the developed formulation was selected as being optimal for efficacy and duration of
action, ocular comfort, and pharmaceutical elegance (low sedimentation rate and effective redispersion of the particles in suspension). formulating

 xxxd367xxx  at ph 7 resulted in a comfortable suspension (alcon research, ltd., data on file).
the laser-treated monkey responded to lower
doses of  xxxd367xxx  than the pigmented rabbit
with regard to iop-lowering action.14 thus, experiments in the laser-treated monkey model typically
used the instillation of a single 0.03-ml drop in contrast to the dual 0.025-ml drops used in the rabbit
experiments. after twice-daily topical ocular treatment of monkeys with either 0.3 mg or 0.6 mg of
 xxxd367xxx , the iop was significantly reduced
from baseline iop at the 12-hour postdose a.m. and
p.m. measurement times (fig. 2). from mean baseline iops of 33.0 mm hg and 31.7 mm hg, the peak
percentage decreases after the first dose were 30.8%
and 26.9% with 1% and 2%  xxxd367xxx  suspension, respectively. after the third dose, the decreases
were 32.8% and 32.9% for 1% and 2% drug, respectively. not unexpectedly, no iop effects were observed in the contralateral untreated monkey eye,
which was not laser-treated and normotensive. the
onset of iop lowering by  xxxd367xxx  in the lasertreated monkey model was seen by 1 hour after dosing, the earliest time point at which iop was measured. peak iop lowering occurred in the monkey
by 3 hours after dosing. the iop decrease was usually greater at 12 hours after the previous morning
dose than it was at 12 hours after the previous
evening dose. the normal diurnal iop curve of the
laser-treated monkey model exhibits a higher iop in
the morning compared to the evening. in general,
the iop-lowering efficacy of  xxxd367xxx  in the
monkey was observed to be greater, and usually occurred at a lower dose, than that observed in the pigmented rabbit. mean baseline iop was in the same
low- to mid-30–mm hg range for rabbit and monkey
models used in these experiments. compared to the
clinical data, the rabbit appeared to be more predictive of the magnitude of the iop decrease seen clinically and the monkey predictive of the dose-response
relationship in the human.9,44,46 physiologic and anatomic differences between species are the probable
explanation.

ocular blood flow
carbon dioxide is a potent vasodilator involved in
the metabolic aspect of autoregulation of blood flow
in the eye and elsewhere in the body. the response

of the microcirculation to increased co2 tension is a
measure of its autoregulatory capacity and reserve.
for this reason, cais are used clinically to assess cerebral blood flow reserve, as they conserve co2 in

nerve head, is expected to be beneficial to those patients with glaucoma who have deficient optic nerve
head (onh) flow. because  xxxd367xxx  is found in
the retina (mean, 0.338 mg equivalents per gram) after topical administration to animals, has a long halflife in this tissue, and could possibly cause elevated
co2 there, the response of the ocular blood flow to
topical and systemic  xxxd367xxx  in animals has
been investigated.3
because of the suggestive nature of some preliminary blood flow data in rabbits and cats, a more extensive crossover evaluation of the blood flow response after topical ocular dosing of  xxxd367xxx 
was carried out. topical ocular administration of
 xxxd367xxx  2% suspension, one drop twice daily,
in a 1-week multidose crossover study in nine tranquilized ( xxxd60xxx ) dutch-belted rabbits significantly increased blood flow to the optic nerve head
as measured by the laser doppler flowmetry (ldf).2,3
these results are presented in greater detail elsewhere in this supplement.2

clinical and nonclinical pharmacokinetics
and biodisposition
the preclinical pharmacokinetics and disposition
of  xxxd367xxx  have been studied in rats, rabbits,
and monkeys.21 the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd367xxx  have been characterized after both oral and
topical ocular administration to human normal volunteers and glaucoma patients.21 topical pharmacokinetic studies were done in normal volunteers not
at steady state and in glaucoma patients at steady
state. in addition, a multiple-dose oral pharmacokinetic study in normal volunteers was done. steady
state is achieved more rapidly from oral than topical
dosing. the metabolism in humans and in vitro
plasma protein binding of  xxxd367xxx  have been
characterized.

topical  xxxd367xxx  ocular uptake and
distribution in rabbits
ocular uptake and distribution studies of 14c- xxxd367xxx  were performed in new zealand albino
and pigmented dutch-belted rabbits to study melanin binding. when administered topically as a 1%
ophthalmic suspension,  xxxd367xxx  is readily absorbed into the conjunctiva, cornea, iris–ciliary body,
aqueous humor, choroid, retina, and lens. maximum
concentrations of radioactivity are achieved in ante-

s125

rior segment tissues within 0.5–2 hours. the concentration of  xxxd367xxx  in iris–ciliary body of pigmented rabbits (3.85 6 2.33 mg equivalents per gram
or 10 mm) is sufficient to inhibit the enzyme in excess
of that needed to suppress aqueous humor formation
and to lower iop. systemically absorbed drug is substantially associated with erythrocytes and other tissues that contain ca enzyme (kidney, liver, stomach,
small intestine, spleen, lungs, and salivary glands).
plasma concentrations are low, as most of the drug
concentrates in the rbcs. radioactivity was eliminated from the aqueous humor and cornea with halflives of 3 and 5 hours, respectively. thus,  xxxd367xxx  in the cornea prolongs its delivery to the ciliary
processes. consistent with tight binding to carbonic
anhydrase, the half-lives in iris–ciliary body, choroid,
retina, and lens are substantially longer, being a matter of days (alcon research, ltd., data on file).
studies in pigmented dutch-belted rabbits showed
a sixfold higher peak iris–ciliary body concentration
of drug than was found in albino rabbits. these results are consistent with a moderate degree of melanin binding of  xxxd367xxx . however, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd367xxx  appear to be influenced
more by binding to carbonic anhydrase than by binding to melanin, as the terminal half-lives in albino and
pigmented rabbits were very similar (alcon research,
ltd., data on file).

systemic pharmacokinetics, absorption,
and bioavailability
pharmacokinetics, single- and multiple-dose tissue
distribution, autoradiography, and excretion/mass
balance studies were performed in rats. the metabolism of  xxxd367xxx  in vivo was determined in
sprague-dawley and fischer-344 rats. whole-blood
and plasma concentrations of  xxxd367xxx  and its
metabolites were measured in toxicology studies in
rats. the lack of chiral inversion to the s-enantiomer
was demonstrated in rats, monkeys, and humans (alcon research, ltd., data on file).
low oral doses of 14c- xxxd367xxx  administered
to rats showed nearly complete absorption (.90%);
however, bioavailability decreased from 70% to 45%
with increasing dose.  xxxd367xxx  preferentially
binds to  xxxg293xxx  and saturates this isozyme in rbcs on
repeated dosing, which consequently contributes to
the nonlinear nature and lack of dose proportionality observed for  xxxd367xxx  pharmacokinetics after oral administration (alcon research, ltd., data
on file).
studies also showed that  xxxd367xxx  was absorbed systemically after topical ocular administration and was substantially associated with ca in the
erythrocytes.21  xxxd367xxx  in the plasma was below

s126

surv ophthalmol 44 (suppl 2) january 2000

quantitation limits after topical ocular administration to rabbits. thus,  xxxd367xxx  absorbed systemically after topical ocular administration is expected
to bind to ca in the rbcs with little free drug remaining in the plasma. despite this degree of systemic bioavailability, complete saturation of ca in
erythrocytes is not achieved. systemic acidosis or the
other side effects associated with oral cais are therefore not expected to occur.
 xxxd367xxx  clinical pharmacokinetics are typical of sulfonamide cais and are influenced by its
tight binding to carbonic anhydrase in tissues, which
contain relatively high enzyme concentrations, most
notably the erythrocytes (rbcs). human rbcs contain approximately 150 mm of carbonic anhydrase
enzyme, of which about 20 mm is  xxxg293xxx  isozyme. the
remainder is the  xxxg287xxx  isozyme.

topical  xxxd367xxx  pharmacokinetic
studies in human normal volunteers
systemic exposure to  xxxd367xxx  was studied in
15 normal male volunteers given bilateral topical ocular doses three times daily for 14 days of  xxxd367xxx  suspension 3%, three times the concentration
of drug in product. drug concentrations in plasma
and whole blood were measured in samples obtained 2 hours after morning doses on days 8 and 15.
on day 8, the mean whole-blood concentration 2
hours after the 8 a.m. dose was 1.42 6 0.80 mg/ml
(range, 0.606–3.35 mg/ml). two weeks later, the
maximal concentration had increased to 2.17 6 0.85
mg/ml (range, 1.02–4.20 mg/ml). however,  xxxd367xxx  concentrations in the blood were not sufficient to saturate ca in rbcs by day 15.  xxxd367xxx 
whole-blood concentrations declined during the
subsequent 8 weeks with a mean half-life of 111 6 29
days, reflecting the tight binding of  xxxd367xxx  to
carbonic anhydrase in the rbcs.  xxxd367xxx 
plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation at all time points because of the drug’s preferential distribution to rbcs.21

oral  xxxd367xxx  pharmacokinetic
and metabolism studies in human
normal volunteers
seven male and seven female normal volunteers
were given oral doses of 1-mg  xxxd367xxx  capsules
twice daily for 32 weeks (or matching placebo capsules in a randomized 4:1 drug:placebo design), and
the whole-blood and plasma pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd367xxx  and its major (n-desethyl- xxxd367xxx )
and minor (o-desmethyl- and o-desmethylpropyl- xxxd367xxx ) metabolites were investigated. this dosage regimen was selected to achieve greater daily
systemic exposure to  xxxd367xxx  (2 mg) than theo-

desantis

retically could be obtained by administering  xxxd367xxx  1% ophthalmic suspension to both eyes
three times daily (1.8 mg). mean rbc data for  xxxd367xxx  demonstrated the rapid saturation of rbc
ca isozyme ii (approximately 20 mm) within 2–4
weeks. steady-state  xxxd367xxx  concentrations in
rbcs (mean, 20–25 mm) were achieved within 12
weeks. after the initial rapid increase in parent drug,
the n-desethyl metabolite appeared at quantifiable
whole-blood levels in all subjects by the sixth week,
but was not found in any plasma samples. two other
active metabolites found in animals, o-desmethylbrinzolamide and n-desmethoxypropyl- xxxd367xxx ,
were not detected in human blood. evaluation of individual rbc concentration versus time profiles indicated that steady state for both parent drug and
metabolite was achieved by week 28. by week 32,
mean rbc concentrations of n-desethyl metabolite
were 7.31 6 1.82 mm in males and 18.2 6 7.5 mm in
females.total carbonic anhydrase activity measurements in whole blood show a rapid fall in activity
after oral administration, mostly because of decreased  xxxg293xxx  activity as saturation of this isoenzyme
in rbcs by parent drug occurs. at the end of the
study, mean total ca activity was about 30% of prestudy values, with approximately 4%–5% of residual
 xxxg293xxx  activity remaining at steady state. the mean total ca inhibition observed in this study (about 70%)
was well below that expected to result in systemic
side effects.21

metabolism of  xxxd367xxx  in animals
and humans
the metabolism of  xxxd367xxx  in rats and monkeys primarily occurs in the liver via oxidative o- and
n-dealkylation.21 based on retention in erythrocytes,
three metabolites, n-desmethoxypropyl- xxxd367xxx ,
o-desmethyl- xxxd367xxx , and n-desethyl- xxxd367xxx , appear to bind to ca. these compounds were
found in rat urine along with the  xxxd3029xxx  analog of  xxxd367xxx . the latter also appeared in the
bile but not in the blood. no inversion of one isomer
to the other has been found for  xxxd367xxx  in vivo;
therefore, it was assumed that metabolites derived
from  xxxd367xxx  were the r-isomers and not racemic mixtures. in cynomolgus monkeys,  xxxd367xxx 
is metabolized to n-desethyl- xxxd367xxx  and o-desmethyl- xxxd367xxx . these metabolites, along with
 xxxd367xxx , are found in monkey whole blood after
topical ocular dosing with  xxxd367xxx  ophthalmic
suspension. n-desmethoxypropyl- xxxd367xxx  was
not detected in monkey whole blood.
clinical studies have shown that  xxxd367xxx  and
n-desethyl- xxxd367xxx  are at substantial concentrations in human whole blood after topical and oral
dosing. the n-desethyl metabolite was not detected

s127

preclinical overview of  xxxd367xxx 

in plasma. in normal subjects treated orally with
 xxxd367xxx  capsules twice daily for 32 weeks,  xxxg293xxx 
saturation occurred within 2 to 4 weeks, reflecting
the much higher systemic input rate from oral dosing compared to topical ocular dosing. the n-desethyl metabolite accumulated to steady-state levels
ranging from approximately 5–25 mm in erythrocytes.
the n-desmethoxypropyl and o-desmethyl metabolites were not detected in human whole blood but
were present in urine as minor metabolites. plasma
concentrations of  xxxd367xxx  were generally below
the quantitation limit (,7.5 ng/ml [alcon research,
ltd., data on file]).
in glaucoma patients, concentrations of parent
drug approached erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx  saturation (20–
25 mm in erythrocytes) typically by 6–9 months. the
n-desethyl metabolite was also detected in some subjects at concentrations lower than those of the parent drug (alcon research, ltd., data on file).

tissue distribution of  xxxd367xxx 
the tissue distribution of 14c- xxxd367xxx  in rats
was typical for this drug class, showing prolonged retention in tissues containing ca. tissue concentrations of radioactivity were greater than those for
plasma. after oral administration of 1 mg/kg of 14cbrinzolamide to rats, the highest radioactivity concentrations (cmax values) were observed in tissues
with high levels of ca, such as the liver, kidneys,
spleen, stomach, small intestine, lungs, and salivary
glands. radioactivity levels in fat, skeletal muscle,
skin, eyes, and testes were low. concentrations of radioactivity in the tissues declined slowly for both dosing regimens, with half-lives ranging up to about 33
days. the half-lives were generally similar to those of
blood (approximately 20 days). because of its high
affinity for  xxxg293xxx ,  xxxd367xxx  is extensively distributed into erythrocytes and exhibits a long half-life in
whole blood. binding to erythrocyte ca is saturable;
therefore, in contrast to plasma pharmacokinetics,
whole-blood pharmacokinetics of  xxxd367xxx  are
nonlinear and drug concentrations are not dose
proportional.  xxxd367xxx  is moderately bound to
plasma proteins.21
results of whole-body autoradiography in male
fischer-344 rats after a single dose of 14c- xxxd367xxx  (1 mg/kg) were in good agreement with results of the tissue excision study. these results also
showed that low levels of radioactivity crossed the
blood-brain barrier and were present in brain, presumably associated with ca (alcon research, ltd.,
data on file).

plasma protein binding
an in vitro protein-binding study in human plasma
showed binding in the range of 58.5% to 62.7%,

which was independent of  xxxd367xxx  concentration over the range of 0.01 to 10 mg/g.21 in rat and
monkey plasma, the binding of 14c- xxxd367xxx  was
higher at the 0.01-mg/g level, but was concentration
independent from 0.1 to 10 mg/g (rat, 74.8–79.9%;
monkey, 23.8–28.5%). because of its moderate level
of protein binding,  xxxd367xxx  is not likely to interact with other drugs that bind to plasma protein.

elimination of  xxxd367xxx 
after intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg of
c- xxxd367xxx  to male rats, 32% and 29% of the
radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces,
respectively, over 14 days. the remaining radioactivity was in the carcass, presumably bound to carbonic
anhydrase in blood and other tissues. in human
urine,  xxxd367xxx  is eliminated principally as the
unchanged drug; however, n-desethyl- xxxd367xxx 
also undergoes excretion.21
14

enterohepatic circulation
enterohepatic circulation was evident in the rat
after the oral administration of 14c- xxxd367xxx .
twenty percent of a 1-mg/kg dose to bile duct–cannulated male fischer-344 rats was excreted in the
bile. although more than 20% of this biliary radioactivity was absorbed, this amount contributed only
about 1% to the total concentration of radioactivity
in the blood 96 hours after administration. thus,
the contribution of enterohepatic circulation of 14cbrinzolamide–derived radioactivity to the wholeblood concentration of radioactivity in the rat was
negligible (alcon research, ltd., data on file).

excretion in milk
low concentrations of radioactivity were excreted
in rat milk. lactating fischer-344 rats were given
oral doses of 1 mg/kg of 14c- xxxd367xxx , and the
concentrations in milk were substantially less than
those in plasma at each collection time. the mean
milk to plasma concentration ratios ranged up to 0.6
at 24 hours after administration, indicating limited
transfer of radioactivity from plasma to milk (alcon
research, ltd., data on file).

fetal absorption
radioactivity crossed the placenta of the fetus in
pregnant female rats given single oral doses of 14cbrinzolamide (1 mg/kg). the transfer of radioactivity from the dam to the fetus was greater for animals
treated during the period of organ development
than for animals treated when organ development
was nearly complete. concentrations of radioactivity
in maternal blood were much higher than those in
maternal tissues. peak levels of radioactivity in fetal

s128

surv ophthalmol 44 (suppl 2) january 2000

tissues were attained 24 hours after administration.
at 24 hours after administration, the fetal blood retained some radioactivity. maternal tissues with the
highest concentrations of radioactivity were those
containing high levels of ca: liver, kidneys, lungs,
mammary glands, and placenta (alcon research,
ltd., data on file).

conclusions
 xxxd367xxx  is a new specific cai of the thienothiazine sulfonamide class that exhibits selectivity, high
affinity, and potent inhibitory activity for ca isozyme
type ii and exhibits iop-lowering efficacy. it is comfortable on instillation. it is readily absorbed into the
eye and has relatively long half-lives (days) in iris–
ciliary body, choroid, retina, lens, and blood. whereas
whole-blood concentrations of  xxxd367xxx  are
present after topical ocular administration, indicating systemic absorption, plasma levels of parent drug
and metabolites are very low, and complete saturation of ca in erythrocytes is not achieved at steady
state. thus, systemic acidosis or the other side effects
associated with oral cais are not expected to occur.
