& abstract: the demonstration by the national surgical
adjuvant breast project (nsabp) that 5 years of  xxxd3285xxx 
therapy is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in
breast cancer incidence in high-risk women was a milestone
in breast cancer prevention. because  xxxd3285xxx  is associated
with increased risk of side-effects such as hot flashes,
menstrual abnormalities, uterine cancer, and thromboembolic
phenomena, its use will not be advisable or acceptable for all
high-risk women. women over 50 years of age appear to be
at highest risk for serious adverse events, such as uterine
cancer and thromboembolic phenomena. individuals in
whom  xxxd3285xxx -associated breast cancer risk reduction
appears to outweigh risk of serious side-effects include
women with prior in situ or  xxxg730xxx  (er)-positive
invasive cancer, atypical hyperplasia, and/or women ages
35Â±49 with a calculated gail 5-year risk of 1.7%,
hysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year
gail risk of 2.5%, and nonhysterectomized women aged 50
and older with a 5-year gail risk of >5.0%. it is not yet clear
whether  xxxd3285xxx  can reduce breast cancer incidence in
women with brca1 and brca2 mutations, although
preliminary evidence favors benefit for at least those with a
brca2 mutation. raloxifene is a selective er modulator with
less uterine estrogen agonist activity than  xxxd3285xxx , and it is
hoped that it will result in fewer uterine cancers but will be
equally efficacious in reducing the risk of breast cancer. the
nsabp is currently conducting a randomized study of
 xxxd3285xxx  versus raloxifene in high-risk postmenopausal
women. approximately one third of invasive cancers are
er negative.  xxxd3285xxx  does not reduce the incidence of
er-negative cancers, nor does it appear to be effective in
preventing the appearance of one third of er-positive
cancers. priorities in prevention research are to develop

breast intraepithelial neoplasia (ien) may be sampled by
minimally invasive techniques and is an attractive short-term
risk biomarker. molecular abnormalities observed in ien may
be used to select potential agents for testing/therapy, and
modulation of these abnormalities may be used in phase i
trials to select appropriate doses and in phase ii trials to
assess response. breast density volume and certain serum
markers such as insulin-like growth factor-1 are also being
studied as potential risk and response biomarkers. reversal
or prevention of advanced ien as well as modulation of other
risk biomarkers in randomized phase ii and phase iii trials is
being evaluated as a means of more efficiently evaluating
prevention drugs in the future. a number of agents are being
developed that target molecular abnormalities in ien, have
fewer or different side effects than  xxxd3285xxx , and may be
effective in er-negative or  xxxd3285xxx -resistant disease. &

wenty-five percent or less of the estimated 192,000
women diagnosed with breast cancer this year are
likely to die of their disease within the next 10 years
(1,2). however, the majority of the 75% who survive
will experience some long-term morbidity from local or
systemic treatment. thus, the goal of prevention efforts
is not only to reduce breast cancer mortality but also
treatment-related morbidity. it is currently recognized
that breast cancer, similar to many other epithelial
malignancies, undergoes several decades of intraepithelial molecular and morphologic change prior to the
clinical appearance of invasive disease (3). these
changes are referred to as intraepithelial neoplasia

(ien; fig. 1) and are associated with an increased
relative risk for cancer beginning at the level of simple
hyperplasia (4). chemoprevention has been defined as a
drug-induced block or reversal of precancerous progression leading to decreased incidence or delay in the
appearance of invasive cancer (5).
 xxxg730xxx  expression in breast
intraepithelial neoplasia
one of the most frequent molecular changes noted
in early breast ien is an increase in the proportion of
terminal lobule duct epithelial cells expressing estrogen
receptor (er), an increase in the er/progesterone
receptor (pr) ratio, and qualitative abnormalities in
er structure or function that make er more susceptible to activation (6Â±10). these changes in hormone
receptors frequently become more pronounced with
progression to atypical hyperplasia and nonÂ±high-grade
carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer. alternatively,
the er expression seen in 5Â±10% of normal duct cells
may be completely lost (11). approximately two thirds
of invasive breast cancers (51% of premenopausal
cancers and 80% of postmenopausal breast cancers)
overexpress er (12), and er expression is highly
correlated with clinical response to antihormonal
therapies (13).
 xxxd3285xxx , a selective er modulator (serm), acts
by binding to er and blocking er-directed transcription
(fig. 2).  xxxd3285xxx  might be expected to have similar

figure 1. pathway for the development of ien in breast. the stepwise
progression that is discernible morphologically is associated with
processes of initiation, promotion, and progression. the various
biological processes may occur over a 30- to 40-year span before
reaching the in situ stage and subsequently progressing to invasive
breast cancer.

figure 2. schematic of the pathway through which  xxxd3285xxx  can
inhibit transcription that is mediated via the er.  xxxd3285xxx 
competitively binds with the er, displacing estrogen. the resultant
complex preferentially binds corepressors rather than coactivators,
which promote transcription. with only corepressors bound to the
receptor, the steroid response element does not function and
transcription is blocked.

biologic activity in breast ien as in breast cancer,
provided that er is expressed.
 xxxd3285xxx  as a chemoprevention agent
currently,  xxxd3285xxx  is the only drug that meets the
criteria of a breast chemopreventive agent and has been
approved by the food and drug administration for use
in breast cancer risk reduction for both premenopausal
and postmenopausal women age 35 or older whose
5-year predicted probability of breast cancer development is at least equal to that of the average 60 years old.
the approval is based on results reported from the
nsabp trial in which women with a 5-year gail risk of
1.7% or higher (14,15) who were randomized to 5 years
of  xxxd3285xxx  enjoyed a 50% reduction in breast cancer
incidence relative to that observed with placebo. the
incidence of er-positive cancers was reduced by 67%,
but er-negative cancer incidence was not changed.
cancer incidence was reduced in women aged 35 to 49 as
well as those over 50. the greatest proportional risk
reduction occurred in those with a prior biopsy with
atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ
(86% and 56%, respectively) (16). given the efficacy of
 xxxd3285xxx  in established cancer, the limitation of benefit
to women with er-positive and or pr-positive tumors
and overexpression of er in most cases of atypical ductal
hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ (lcis)
(7Â±9,17Â±19), the nsabp results are not surprising.
somewhat puzzling is the lack of reduction in breast
cancer incidence in women randomized to  xxxd3285xxx 
reported for the royal marsden prevention trial and
the italian prevention trial (20,21). updates of both

chemoprevention for high-risk women  313

trials reported this year still fail to demonstrate a
significant difference, although at a median follow-up
time of 7 years, the italian trial is beginning to show a
trend in favor of  xxxd3285xxx , especially in women who
took concomitant hormone replacement therapy at
some point in the trial (22,23). a variety of explanations
has been offered for the disparate results between the
nsabp and european trials (24Â±26). however, the most
likely major factors are a lower short-term relative risk in
the italian and royal marsden trials, combined with
fewer subjects and relatively modest follow-up times
from a prevention perspective. differences in compliance, hormonal milieu (the europeans were allowed to
take concomitant hormone replacement therapy), and
precancerous biology are other potential explanations
(26,27). approximately one third of breast cancers are
er negative at diagnosis (12). er is probably lost during
the intraepithelial neoplastic process as a result of
methylation of the gene promotor (11). women under
50 years old are more than twice as likely to have an
er-negative tumor as women over 50 (12,28,29).
likewise, women with a brca1 mutation have a higher
prevalence of er-negative tumors than those with
sporadic tumors (30Â±34).
royal marsden participants had a younger median
age and may have been more likely to harbor brca1
mutations than the nsabp participants (20). on the
basis of age and potential mutation status, royal
marsden participants may have been more likely to
harbor er-negative precancerous lesions and therefore
less likely to have outcomes favorably impacted by
 xxxd3285xxx  (6,22,31,35,36).
the international breast cancer intervention study in
which  xxxd3285xxx  or placebo is administered to high-risk
women is still ongoing and may help to resolve some of
these issues (24). however, given the increased risk of
hot flashes, menstrual abnormalities and bone loss in
premenopausal women, and hot flashes, uterine cancer,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and
stroke in women over 50 years old (16,37), questions
have arisen as to what groups of women other than
those with a prior biopsy of atypical hyperplasia or lcis
receive sufficient benefit to offset potential side-effects
(38). women with a prior diagnosis of ductal carcinoma
in situ (dcis) or invasive cancer have a relative risk of
developing a new contralateral primary tumor of three
times or more that of the average-risk woman (39).
treatment with  xxxd3285xxx  appears to reduce the risk of
contralateral breast cancer by 40Â±50% in women with
er-positive invasive breast cancer or dcis, thus making

these women excellent candidates for risk reduction
therapy (19). women with brca1 or brca2 deleterious mutations have a 50% or higher lifetime risk of
breast cancer (40,41). tumors in women with brca2
mutations are likely to be er positive, but those in
women with brca1 mutations are more likely to lack
er expression. although it is unclear at present whether
preventive  xxxd3285xxx  therapy will result in substantial
risk reduction in women harboring a brca1 mutation,
preliminary evidence suggests it should be beneficial in
those with a brca2 mutation (42,43).
the majority of women interested in risk reduction
therapy have not had a prior precancerous biopsy or
prior breast cancer and are not known to harbor a
brca1 or brca2 mutation. what advice should be
given to them?
it would appear that  xxxd3285xxx  might legitimately be
offered to any woman age 35 or older meeting the
nsabp p-1 eligibility criterion of a 5-year gail predicted
probability of 1.7% (fig. 3). however, the participants
in the p-1 trial actually had a much higher average gail
risk, almost 2.0 times that required for entry and over 2.5
times that of the average 50-year-old participant (fig. 4).
gail et al. have recently published detailed guidelines
predicting benefit by age, race, and calculated risk level
(15). simplistically, white women between the ages of 35
and 50 can be expected to benefit if the calculated 5-year
gail risk is 1.7%, but for nonhysterectomized women
over 50 (who have a greater risk of uterine cancer and

figure 3. representation of the risk for development of breast cancer
according to the gail model. for example, a woman with menarche at
age 14 and no first live birth before age 30, but no other risk factors,
would experience a gradual increase in risk per year with increasing
age. a biopsy at age 45 would result in an increased calculated risk, as
would a sister being diagnosed with breast cancer when the woman is
55. finally, a second biopsy at age 60 would increase risk again, and if
the biopsy shows evidence of atypical hyperplasia, would be an
additional increase in risk.

thromboembolic phenomena), a calculated 5-year gail
risk of 5% (2.5% for hysterectomized women) may be
needed to offset the increased risk of major side-effects.
for african american women, the minimum calculated
gail risk needed to offset potential side-effects is less
clear. gail et al. originally estimated that it to be higher
as the risk of side-effects might be higher (15). however,
a recent study indicates risk of uterine cancer or
thromboembolic events for  xxxd3285xxx -treated caucasians and african americans is similar (15,44). women
with prior dcis or er-positive invasive cancer, prior
lcis or atypical hyperplasia, or a brca1 or brca2
germline mutation will generally have a short-term risk
for invasive cancer in excess of the minimum level needed
to offset side-effect risks and are good candidates for
 xxxd3285xxx  prevention therapy provided that there is no
history of thromboembolic phenomena or precancerous
uterine biopsy (table 1).
although the gail risk model has been validated for
populations undergoing screening (45,46), it may have
modest discriminatory accuracy at the individual level
(47). furthermore, many women may have risk factors
for breast cancer not considered by the gail model.
additional methods for assessing short-term risk would
be helpful for women considering prevention drug
intervention.
prevention challenges
current prevention challenges are to develop (a)
biomarkers to refine short-term risk assessments based

risk and response biomarkers are needed to design
efficient testing models to determine a drug's potential as
a chemoprevention agent prior to embarking on a cancer
incidence trial requiring tens of thousands of subjects and
hundreds of millions of dollars (48). once validated,
these markers could also be utilized outside of the trial
setting by the individual woman and her physician to help
guide decisions regarding initiation or continuation of
prevention drug treatment. vigorous efforts are ongoing
to develop blood, tissue, and imaging risk biomarkers
that will supplement gail predictions and perhaps refine
short-term risk estimates on an individual basis.
candidate risk markers for premenopausal and
postmenopausal women include serum insulin-like
growth factor-1 and its binding protein (igf-1 and
igfbp-3), mammographic breast density volume, and
breast ien detected by random periareolar fine needle
aspiration (fna) or ductal lavage (49Â±54). for postmenopausal women, serum levels of bioavailable
estradiol and testosterone are also potential risk
biomarkers (55).
of these, the biomarker most closely tied to the
underlying neoplastic process is breast ien (56), and it is
currently being utilized to select women already known
to be at increased risk on the basis of epidemiologic
variables for phase i and phase ii chemoprevention
trials (48,52).
candidate response biomarkers include the risk
biomarkers mentioned previously in this article as well

as mechanism of action biomarkers reflecting molecular abnormalities commonly encountered in breast
ien, including (a) increased and/or disordered
proliferation (57,58), (b) overexpressed er and
hypersensitive er variant (10,59,60), (c) increased
tissue aromatase and sulfatase activities resulting in
increased tissue estrogen levels (61Â±64), (d) increased
growth factor receptor expression/activation (65Â±72),
(d) increased  xxxg1884xxx  expression (73,74),
(e) increased tissue polyamines (75Â±77), (f) enhanced
angiogenesis (78) and protease activity (79,80), (g) aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes (81Â±83), and
(h) dysregulated apoptosis (fig. 5) (58), (84Â±86). to
date, modulation of proliferation, breast ien morphology, mammographic density, and serum igf-1/igfbp-3
ratio have been the most widely used biomarkers of
response in phase i and ii chemoprevention trials
(fig. 6 and 7). however, mechanism of action biomarkers are increasingly being utilized in both phase i and
phase ii trials to select the most appropriate candidates
for the drug trial as well as to measure response.
modulation of proliferation markers such as ki-67
have been correlated with clinical response to a variety of
hormonal agents, including  xxxd3285xxx  in neoadjuvant
studies of established breast cancer (87,88). likewise,
 xxxd3285xxx  administration has been associated with a
reduction of both mammographic breast density volume
and serum igf-1 in at least some subsets of women in

functions through the er to promote transcription. an erindependent pathway is initiated by various growth factors and is
mediated via kinase cascades. for both pathways, the simultaneous
loss of tumor suppressor gene function may exacerbate the preneoplastic processes of increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis,
increased angiogenesis, and increased protease activity.

prevention trials (53,89,90). however, validation of these

not yet been accomplished. consequently, these markers
may not yet be used outside the context of a clinical trial to
assess response to a chemoprevention agent.

activity in er-positive  xxxd3285xxx  resistant or ernegative precancerous tissues, is a major priority.
raloxifene, a second-generation serm with less uterine
agonist activity than  xxxd3285xxx , appeared to be associated with reduced breast cancer incidence in a study of
older osteoperotic women in which the primary endpoint study was reduction of bone-fracture incidence
(91). raloxifene is currently being compared with
 xxxd3285xxx  in a primary breast cancer prevention trial
with an accrual goal of 22,000 postmenopausal women
(92). enthusiasm for further development of new
prevention drugs will be highly dependent on development of more efficient testing models. a special
american association of cancer research task force
has been convened and is examining the possibility of
prevention or reversal of advanced ien (atypical
hyperplasia or in situ cancer) as potential definitive
endpoints for prevention trials (93).
alternative prevention strategies are to (a) develop/
test new serms lacking uterine agonist activity, i.e.,
arzoxifene and em652 (94Â±96), (b) develop er downregulators that may circumvent some types of  xxxd3285xxx 
resistance (97), e.g.,  xxxd2165xxx  (98,99), (c) decrease blood
or breast tissue estrogen levels with soy or aromatase
inhibitors/inactivators, e.g.,  xxxd173xxx , exemestane,
and  xxxd2459xxx  (100Â±103), (d) promote differentiation
with agents such as recombinant human chorionic
gonadotrophin and novel progestins such as tibilone
(104Â±107), (e) inhibit  xxxg2198xxx  activity with
agents such as  xxxd2192xxx , sugen 6668, iressa
(108,109), (f) inhibit  xxxg1884xxx  activity e.g.,
celecoxib, rofecoxib (110,111), (g) reduce igf-1 levels
with  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  analogues (112Â±114), retinoids (115),
and serms (49), (h) induce re-expression of silenced
tumor suppressor genes with histone deacetylase inhibitors) (116), and (i) reduce polyamine levels (i.e.,
 xxxd2430xxx ) (117). many of these agents
are currently in phase i and phase ii prevention studies.
summary
 xxxd3285xxx  is currently the only food and drug
administration-approved agent for breast cancer risk
reduction. although it may be offered to any woman
with a calculated 5-year risk of 1.7%,  xxxd3285xxx 
administration carries an increased risk of serious sideeffects, particularly for women over 50. clinical benefit
can be anticipated to be greatest in those women with
the highest short-term risk of breast cancer and lowest
risk of thromboembolic phenomena and uterine cancer.

those individuals likely to derive greatest benefit are
women with a prior biopsy of atypical hyperplasia,
lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ, or er-positive
invasive breast cancer. the anticipated risk benefit ratio
is also favorable for caucasian women 35 to 49 years
old with a calculated 5-year gail risk of 1.7%, women
50 years old with a 5-year gail of 2.5% without a
uterus or 5.0% if they retain their uterus. women with
a prior history of deep venous thrombosis or uterine
precancerous conditions should probably avoid  xxxd3285xxx  prevention therapy.  xxxd3285xxx  does not reduce the
incidence of er-negative cancers and only reduces the
incidence of er-positive cancers by 67%.
current prevention research priorities are to develop
(a) biomarkers predictive of short-term risk as well as
response to chemopreventive agents, (b) agents with
fewer side-effects or different side-effect profiles than
serms, as well as agents that will be effective in
er-negative as well as er-positive  xxxd3285xxx -resistant
precancerous tissues, (c) efficient clinical models to test
these new agents, and (d) efficient clinical trial models to
assess new agent efficacy.
mammographic breast density volume, serum igf-1/
igfbp3, and breast ien are all attractive risk biomarkers and are being studied as indicators of response to
prevention interventions as well. breast ien, sampled by
minimally invasive techniques such as fna, may also be
used as a source to obtain biomarkers predictive of
response to classes of agents (such as er). reduction in
proliferation and/or reversal or prevention of progression to advanced ien may also be used as general
indicators of response in phase i and phase ii prevention
trials. response biomarkers once validated may eventually replace cancer incidence as an endpoint in early
phase iii trials.
