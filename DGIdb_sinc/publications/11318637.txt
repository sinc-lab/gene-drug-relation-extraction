abstract: 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase (kbl,  xxxg871xxx ) is a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)
dependent enzyme, which catalyzes the second reaction step on the main metabolic degradation pathway
for threonine. it acts in concert with threonine dehydrogenase and converts 2-amino- xxxd64xxx , the
product of threonine dehydrogenation by the latter enzyme, with the participation of cofactor coa, to
glycine and acetyl-coa. the enzyme has been well conserved during evolution, with 54% amino acid
sequence identity between the escherichia coli and human enzymes. we present the three-dimensional
structure of e. coli kbl determined at 2.0 √• resolution. kbl belongs to the r family of plp-dependent
enzymes, for which the prototypic member is aspartate aminotransferase. its closest structural homologue
is e. coli 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase. like many other members of the r family, the functional
form of kbl is a dimer, and one such dimer is found in the asymmetric unit in the crystal. there are two
active sites per dimer, located at the dimer interface. both monomers contribute side chains to each active/
substrate binding site. electron density maps indicated the presence in the crystal of the schiff base
intermediate of 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  and plp, an external aldimine, which remained bound to kbl
throughout the protein purification procedure. the observed interactions between the aldimine and the
side chains in the substrate binding site explain the specificity for the substrate and provide the basis for
a detailed proposal of the reaction mechanism of kbl. a putative binding site of the coa cofactor was
assigned, and implications for the cooperation with threonine dehydrogenase were considered.

threonine degradation occurs via three pathways; the main
pathway involves a two-step process that converts threonine
to glycine (1-3). this pathway (figure 1) is common to
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and involves two enzymes:
 xxxd3361xxx  dehydrogenase [tdh,1 ec 1.1.1.103 (4-6)] and
2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase (kbl,  xxxg871xxx ) (2,
3, 7-9). in the first step, which requires the cofactor nad,
tdh converts  xxxd3361xxx  into l-2-amino- xxxd64xxx .
this intermediate then serves as a substrate for kbl, which,
in the presence of coa, catalyzes the conversion of 2-amino3-ketobutyrate to glycine and acetyl-coa. glycine can be
utilized as an educt for serine synthesis, while acetyl-coa
is utilized in a large variety of metabolic reactions [e.g.,
ecocyc (10)]. the reactions catalyzed by tdh and kbl
are coupled, both in vivo and in vitro (9), and the two
enzymes have been shown to form a complex, most likely
containing one tetramer of tdh and two dimers of kbl (7,
8, 11). this concerted mode of action is consistent with the
highly reactive nature of the 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  intermediate, which in aqueous solution undergoes spontaneous

2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligases (also known as
 xxxg871xxx  or  xxxg871xxx ) from both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been extensively studied
(11, 13-18). the first enzyme was cloned from escherichia
coli (19), and cloning of a human enzyme has been described
recently (14). the sequence identity between the e. coli and
human enzymes is 54% and indicates strong conservation
of kbl during evolution. in addition to  xxxd1739xxx , kbl
also requires  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) for activity and,
therefore, belongs to the class of plp-dependent enzymes.
the plp-dependent enzymes form one of the most
versatile protein families. the range of reactions catalyzed
by these enzymes spans a broad spectrum and includes
transaminations, beta-eliminations, racemizations, replacement
reactions, and a variety of other reactions (20-23). with
few exceptions, these enzymes are involved in amino acid
metabolism (20, 23) and play a vital role as a link between
carbon and nitrogen metabolism (24).
several classification schemes of plp-dependent enzymes
have been introduced over the years (21, 23, 25, 26). their
classification was far from simple due to generally low
sequence homology between these enzymes, even between
enzymes sharing the same fold. initially, the classification
was based on sequence alignments and the reaction specificity, i.e. which carbon atom of the quinonoid intermediate,
r, beta, or gamma, was the target for the catalytic activity (26). more
recently, the plp-dependent enzymes have been divided into
four fold-type groups on the basis of their three-dimensional
structures (21, 27). sequence analysis using the family
profile analysis algorithm (28), capable of identifying very
distant relationships between protein families, reconciled the
sequence-based and structure-based classifications and provided grouping of enzymes in agreement with structural
characteristics of 23 proteins with known three-dimensional
structures (23). the four independent families are named the
r family (aspartate aminotransferase family), the beta family
(tryptophan synthase family), the d- xxxg941xxx 
family, and the alanine racemase family. while there is some
correlation between the family class and the r, beta, or gamma carbon
reactive center, there is no one-to-one correspondence
between the two classification schemes (21, 29). for
example, the r family contains enzymes with either r or gamma
carbon reactivity.
during the course of the reaction the plp cofactor forms
a covalent bond to the enzyme, a schiff base linkage between
the aldehyde carbonyl of plp and the -amino group of a
lysine (20, 21, 24, 30). during catalysis, the lysine side chain
of this internal aldimine is replaced by the incoming amino
acid substrate to form the external aldimine. the general
chemical steps in the plp-catalyzed reactions are well
established (20). the differences in the type of reaction
catalyzed by various enzymes reflect local differences in the
environment of plp and the specific substrate.
in this study we have investigated the three-dimensional
structure of 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase from e. coli,
a member of the r family of plp-dependent enzymes.
although neither plp nor the substrate was added to the
protein during purification or crystallization, the crystals
contained kbl complexed with  xxxd3047xxx  in the
form of its external aldimine with 2-amino- xxxd64xxx .
this fortuitously trapped reaction intermediate allowed us
to propose the molecular details of the catalytic mechanism.

schmidt et al.
the structure of kbl is similar to that of e. coli 8-amino7-oxononanoate synthase (29), with which it shares 35%
amino acid identity.
experimental procedures
cloning and expression of the e. coli kbl gene. the fulllength kbl gene was amplified by pcr with recombinant
taq dna polymerase (amersham-pharmacia) using genomic dna from the strain mc1061 as a template. primers
were obtained from hukabel scientifique lteÃÅe. (montreÃÅal,
canada). the forward primer orl287 5‚Ä≤-tctggagaatcgcatatgcgtggag-3‚Ä≤ and reverse primer orl288 5‚Ä≤cgctttcatctcggatcctcaggcg-3‚Ä≤ incorporating
ndei and bamhi restriction sites, respectively (in bold), were
utilized for directional cloning into a derivative of pgex4t1 vector (amersham-pharmacia) in order to obtain an inframe fusion with schistosoma japonicum glutathione stransferase (gst) and a thrombin cleavage site. this
derivative cloning vector contained an insertion, which
introduced a ndei site just upstream of the bamhi normally
present in pgex-4t1. transformants were screened by pcr
for the presence of the correct insert, and positives were then
restricted with hincii for confirmation. the plasmid was then
transformed into the protein expression strain dl41 from
stratagene (la jolla, ca).
an overnight culture of the transformed e. coli dl41
strain was inoculated in defined lemaster medium (31)
containing 100 ¬µg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 ¬∞c. this
culture was diluted 10-fold in the same medium and grown
under the same conditions for 2 h, after which time it was
transferred to 22 ¬∞c and 100 ¬µm iptg (sigma, st. louis,
mo) was added. the induced culture was grown for 20 h
before being harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 4 ¬∞c,
4000g).
purification and crystallization. cells were resuspended
in 40 ml of lysis buffer [50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 0.4 m
nacl, 1 mm edta, 1% (w/v) triton x-100, 5% (w/v)
glycerol, 20 mm dtt, and 1 tablet of complete protease
inhibitor cocktail from roche molecular biology, montreal,
quebec, canada]. after sonication (sonicator w-375, heat
systems-ultrasonics inc., 6 √ó 30 s at 50% power with 30 s
between cycles) the lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation
at 150000g at 4 ¬∞c for 45 min.
the protein supernatant was passed through a deaesepharose column (pharmacia) and the flow-through subsequently loaded on a 5 ml glutathione-sepharose 4b
column (pharmacia). after two wash steps, first with 4 bed
volumes of buffer a [50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 1 m nacl,
5% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm edta, and 1% (w/v) triton
x-100) and then with 3 bed volumes of buffer b [50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 0.2 m nacl, and 5% (w/v) glycerol], the
bound gst fusion protein was cleaved on the beads by
addition of ‚àº100 ¬µg of r-thrombin (haematologic technologies inc.) and incubation for 75 min at room temperature.
kbl was then eluted from the column in ‚àº3 bed volumes
of buffer b, and the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to ‚àº8 mg/ml in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 0.2 m nacl,
and 1 mm edta. the protein was assessed for purity by
sds-page and for solution behavior by dynamic light
scattering (dls; dynapro-801, protein solutions, charlottesville, va).

crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor
diffusion method. the droplets contained 2 ¬µl of protein
solution and 4 ¬µl of reservoir solution [2.2 m (nh4)2so4,
0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate, ph 6.4, 3.4% (w/v)
glycerol, and 3 mm dtt]. orthorhombic crystals appeared
within a few days at 18 ¬∞c. the best crystals with cell
dimensions a ) 63.94 √•, b ) 98.66 √•, and c ) 118.70 √•
and space group p212121 were obtained by macroseeding.
the crystals contain two molecules per asymmetric unit
related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis parallel to the
crystallographic b-axis. prior to data collection, a crystal was
transferred into a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 2.2
m (nh4)2so4, 0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate, ph 6.4,
and 23% (w/v) glycerol for 10-20 s. it was then mounted
in a rayon cryoloop (hampton research) and flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen at 100 k.
data collection, mad phasing, and model building. data
were collected using a quantum-4 ccd detector (area
detector systems corp.) at the x8c beamline at the national
synchrotron light source, brookhaven national laboratory,
upton, ny. diffraction images were collected with 1.5¬∞
oscillations and an exposure time of 45 s.
multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (mad) data sets
were collected on a se-met labeled crystal at three different
wavelengths: lambda1 (peak) ) 0.979305 √•, lambda2 (inflection point)
) 0.97955 √•, and lambda3 (high energy remote) ) 0.961123 √• at
100 k to 2.0 √• resolution (table 1). data processing and
scaling were performed with denzo and scalepack
(32). all of the 24 expected selenium sites per dimer were
identified by solve (33) with an overall figure of merit
(fom) of 0.87 in the resolution range 12-2.0 √•. a map
calculated after solvent flattening and skeletonization by dm
(34) was of excellent quality with an improved overall fom
of 0.93. the bones [o (35)] clearly showed the secondary
structure for both molecules of the dimer in the asymmetric
unit. a self-rotation function was calculated using program
polarrfn of the ccp4 suite, version 4.0 (36), to determine
the orientation of the expected 2-fold axis. in addition, a
noncrystallographic symmetry search using the selenium
positions was carried out using the ccp4 suite.
starting from the initial mad-phased map, automated
model building was attempted by using warpntrace (37) and

refinement as implemented in the arp-warp 5.0 program
package (38). using warpntrace, a set of four independent
free atom models was built into the initial electron density
map and subjected to repeated cycles of refinement with
refmac (ccp4) and automatic chain tracing. the protein size
was set to 4000 atoms, the resolution range to 12.0-2.0 √•,
the refinement cycle number to 75, and the number of
molecules in the asymmetric unit to 2. remaining parameters
required by the program were set to default values. after
each rebuilding round, consisting of 75 cycles, the resulting
partial model was checked visually using the program o,
and solvent atoms were removed. the resulting model was
used as the starting point for the next run. selenium atoms
found in solve were included in the refinement. when
‚àº200 of the expected 802 residues were traced, phase
restraints were applied and rebuilding and tracing continued
as outlined above. when the protein chain was 95%
complete, side chains were inserted by the side_trace routine
of the arp package using default settings. the model was
then adjusted manually using the program o, including
corrections of side chain positions and building of missing
residues from the n-termini and small loop regions into the
electron density. when the protein model was complete,
solvent molecules were introduced into the structure using
arp. for the protein, the restraints weight was set to 0.6,
phase restraints were omitted. and the refinement cycle
number was decreased to 20. no noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied throughout the whole refinement process. the progress of model building and refinement
was monitored with the r-factor, the r-free, the connectivity
index (during building), the correlation of fo to fc, and the
root-mean-square deviation from mean density. in the region
near the putative active site there was residual electron
density, which was clearly identified as  xxxd3047xxx 
forming a schiff base with the substrate, 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  (figure 2). in addition, four glycerol molecules were
modeled into the appropriate electron density at the surface
of the protein. the external aldimine and the glycerol
molecules were included in the final steps of the refinement.
the crystallographic refinement converged to an r-factor of
0.151 (r-free of 0.206) and a correlation coefficient (fofc)
of 0.95 for 50708 reflections (no sigma cutoff) and 7258 atoms.
the structure was validated with procheck (39). the final
coordinates have been deposited in the protein databank with
access code 1fc4.
results and discussion
kbl was expressed at a high level, in the range of 20
mg/l cell culture. the purified protein migrated as a single,
43 kda band on an sds-page gel. dynamic light
scattering measurements corresponded to a monodisperse
solution with an estimated molecular weight for the protein
of ‚àº80 kda, indicating that kbl exists in solution as a
dimer.
quality of the kbl model. both monomers (residues glyser-his-met1...ala398) are well defined in the electron
density map, including the three additional residues at the
n-terminus (gly-ser-his) that remain after cleavage with
thrombin. subtle differences between monomers do occur
in some short loop regions and side chain positions. the
refinement converged to a rather low r-factor of 0.15,
indicating overall a well-defined structure. the geometry of

the model is very good, with 88.5% of the non-glycine or
non-proline residues present in the most favored regions of
the ramachandran plot. only two residues, the two active
site lysines, which are very well defined in terms of electron
density, are found in generously allowed regions. this is also
observed in other plp-dependent enzymes, e.g., the structure
of bacterial  xxxg2256xxx  [tryptophan indole-lyase (40)]. the
external aldimine is for the most part well defined in the
electron density (figure 2) and corresponds to the substrate
trapped as a schiff base with the  xxxd3047xxx 
cofactor.
structure of the kbl monomer. kbl belongs to the r
family of plp-dependent enzymes (23), for which aspartate
aminotransferase is the prototypic enzyme. in topological
terms kbl belongs to the r/beta protein class. the molecule
can be divided into three segments: the n-terminal arm, the
small domain, and the large plp-binding domain (figure
3). a topology diagram is shown in figure 4.
the n-terminal arm (residues 2-19) is formed by a single
helix, which extends away from rest of the monomer and
primarily contributes to dimer formation. the small domain
is made of two segments assembled from the n-terminal
(residues 22-57) and c-terminal (residues 295-398) sections of the primary sequence. this domain consists of two
small, nearly perpendicular beta-sheets and three r-helices,
which cover the external, solvent-directed surface of the
sheets. the plp-binding domain (residues 58-294) has as
its main feature a large, seven-stranded twisted beta-sheet in
which all strands but the second one are parallel (figures 3
and 4). this beta-sheet is found in all plp-binding proteins
belonging to the r family (21). in kbl there are three short,
extended stretches (strands) adding to the large sheet on the
side involved in dimer contacts. three r-helices cover the
concave side of the large sheet and are approximately parallel
to the neighboring beta-strands. the convex side of the beta-sheet
is covered by six r-helices, one of which is only one turn
long. the loops between secondary structure elements are
generally very short.
the two domains are assembled at an angle (figure 3)
and are supported by two consecutive, long r-helices
(residues 280-294 and 296-314). this arrangement creates
a deep cleft between the domains. the concave side of the
beta-sheet of the plp-binding domain faces the side of the
beta-sheet of the small domain free of r-helices. the bottom

by the side chains from the beta-sheets of the small domain on
the other side. a seven residue long loop from the plpbinding domain that holds lys244, the crucial residue that
forms a schiff base with the plp, protrudes into this cleft
(figure 3).
structure of the kbl dimer. the two molecules of kbl
form a tight dimer. an extensive contact surface is provided
by the concave sides of the beta-sheets of the two plp-binding
domains which face each other. the small domain contacts
the large domain of the other molecule along the edge of
the large beta-sheet. finally, the n-terminal arm wraps the
second molecule along the n-terminal ends of the large
beta-sheet. approximately one-fourth, or 4260 √•2, of each
monomer‚Äôs surface is buried upon association, based on a
probe radius of 1.4 √•. the dimer is very compact: as each
monomer has 16 226 √•2 accessible surface, the dimer has
only 24 355 √•2.
the active site contains residues from both monomers and
is fully formed only when the dimer is assembled. the plpbinding cleft within a monomer is complemented by residues
from the second monomer and transformed into a cavity to
which access is along a deep, narrowing down funnel-like
opening. side chains from both monomers contact the plp
moiety; however, the putative catalytic residues come from
only one monomer. the substrate binding cavity has an
amphipathic character. residues on one side of the pyrimidine ring are polar, acidic, and basic, including lys244. the
other side of the cavity has a hydrophobic character,
dominated by several phenylalanines (figure 5). access to
the substrate binding cavity, as observed in this structure, is
too narrow to admit either the plp or the substrate, implying
that a conformational rearrangement within the dimer has

to occur for the complete catalytic cycle to take place. this
could be of either a local nature, with movement of several
loops, or, more likely, a movement of the entire small domain
(20). small domain movement upon substrate binding was
observed in a structurally related enzyme, 8-amino-7oxononanoate synthase (41), where the active site cleft of a
monomer becomes narrower in the presence of the external
aldimine. the large buried surface of the kbl dimer makes
a dynamic exchange of protein molecules between dimers
and monomers rather unlikely. such equilibrium has been
observed, however, when the association of the molecules
into a dimer occurs with a relatively small buried surface
area, as in the case of  xxxg1626xxx , a plpdependent enzyme with only 655 √•2 of buried surface upon
association (42). the large buried surface area of kbl
indicates that the enzyme might need other interactions, like
the binding of coa and/or complex formation with tdh,
to trigger conformational changes leading to substrate binding
and product release.
cofactor binding. although neither plp nor 2-amino-3ketobutyrate was added to the protein during purification or
crystallization, significant residual electron density was
observed in the active site cavity of kbl. a molecule of
 xxxd3047xxx  fitted well to part of this density, with
the strongest feature corresponding to the phosphate group
and somewhat lower density for the pyridine ring. the
remaining electron density corresponded well to the expected
shape of 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  in the form of an external
aldimine with plp (figure 2). thus, it appears that we have
found in the crystal a trapped intermediate of the reaction
catalyzed by kbl. this external aldimine has remained
bound within the active site throughout purification and

crystallization of the enzyme. a key factor contributing to
trapping of this intermediate is most likely the absence of
 xxxd1739xxx , which is necessary for the subsequent reaction
step. as the kbl protein is highly overexpressed in e. coli,
there might be insufficient  xxxd1739xxx  for the reaction to
proceed. the external aldimine formed in the first step of
the overall reaction is tightly bound in kbl‚Äôs substrate
binding cavity and is almost completely buried within the
dimer interface (figure 6).
external aldimines have been observed in the crystal
structures of other plp-dependent enzymes, for example, in
human  xxxg1621xxx  complexed with inhibitors
(43) and in 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (aons)
complexed with plp and its substrate (41). however, in these
cases plp and/or the substrate had to be introduced

deliberately by soaking or cocrystallization and corresponded
to the product rather than substrate aldimine.
several residues in the vicinity of the external aldimine
have already been proven to play a role in catalysis, including
lys244 (18) and arg368 (11), and in the crystal structure
they were indeed found to interact closely with the substrate
and cofactor (figure 5). it is clear from the electron density
that there is no covalent linkage between the plp cofactor
and the lys244 amino group. while lys244 remains in
proximity to the c4‚Ä≤ and the imine nitrogen atom of the plp,
its n atom contributes to the stabilization of the phosphate
group by forming hydrogen bonds with two of its oxygens.
the phosphate is held in place by additional hydrogen bonds
involving all of its oxygens and the nh groups of cys111,
phe112, and asn275, ogamma of ser274, and ogamma1 of thr241.
none of these groups compensates the negative charge of
the phosphate, as it is expected that the active site lys244
is in a deprotonated state in order to carry out its function
as a general base and proton abstractor (44-49). the
pyridoxal aromatic ring is held in position by a hydrogen
bond from the side chain of asp210 to the positively charged
ring nitrogen (figure 5), a weak hydrogen bond between the
ogamma of ser185 and o3‚Ä≤, and stacking against the ring of
his136. the imine nitrogen forms a weak hydrogen bond to
n2 of his213, which in turn is hydrogen bonded from ndelta1
to the tyr52 hydroxyl group. from the geometry of the
hydrogen-bonding pattern, his213 appears to be in a protonated form. nmr studies on kbl from beef liver
mitochondria indicated protonation of this residue (15). this
is also indirectly supported by the fact that in  xxxg2256xxx 
(40) and tyrosine phenol-lyase (50) the structural equivalent
of this histidine is an arginine, a residue normally carrying
a positive charge (figure 5).
the 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  moiety is found in a conformation close to cis with regard to the c4‚Ä≤-n bond. this
differs from the conformation found in other external
aldimines, e.g., in aons (41), where the conformation along

3-d structure of e. coli kbl
this bond is trans. this end of the external aldimine is
involved in an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, which
includes several water molecules (figure 5). arg368, a
residue conserved throughout the protein class, interacts with
the keto oxygen and with one of the carboxyl oxygens. the
same carboxyl oxygen is also hydrogen bonded to ser185
and to a water molecule. the other carboxyl oxygen is
hydrogen bonded to his136, which in turn forms a hydrogen
bond to ser138, and stacks against the pyridine ring of plp.
in the observed conformation the bond to be modified in
the next step of the reaction (between cr and c of the keto
group) is nearly in the plane of the pyrimidine ring, while
the bond to the acidic group is nearly perpendicular to this
plane. such orientation is opposite to the accepted model of
the reaction (20, 51). at the same time, it is the acidic rather
than the keto group that is pointing toward the entrance to
the funnel leading outside. all this suggests that the 2-amino3-ketobutyrate as found in this structure may not be in the
productive state. the transformation to a productive state
would probably require a rotation around the n(imino)-cr
bond by ‚àº180¬∞. figure 2 shows that the electron density
for the pyrimidine ring is weaker than that for the phosphate
group on one end and the ketobutyrate on the other end.
this likely indicates that the pyrimidine ring in the center is
more mobile than the ends of the aldimine molecule but may
also reflect the fact that the two orientations of the ketobutyrate group require somewhat different position of the ring
and that we indeed observe a mixture of orientations.
among sequences of kbl proteins from various species,
the residues that make contact with the external aldimine,
lys244, arg368, asp210, his213, and his136, are conserved. extending the comparison to the r family of plpdependent enzymes (figure 5) shows that only lys244,
arg368, and asp210 are strictly conserved. his136 seems
to play a role only for positioning of the  xxxd3047xxx ‚Äôs aromatic ring, as it is replaced by phenylalanine or
tyrosine in most other sequences (figure 5). his213 is mostly
replaced by arginine and in one case by glutamine. as can
be expected, those amino acids interacting with the cofactor
and the carbonyl group of the amino acid substrate are better
conserved than those interacting with the variable side chain
of the amino acid substrate.
the molecule found in the active site is a reaction
intermediate, which is normally immediately attacked by
coa and cleaved into an acetyl group, which remains
attached to the coa molecule, and a glycine molecule, which
remains attached to the plp. in fact, the funnel leading to
the active site cavity is just wide enough to admit the
pantothenate/beta- xxxd1787xxx  arm of a coa molecule.
as well, the local surface shows a cluster of basic residues
that could act as a binding site for the phosphate groups.
near this putative phosphate binding site we found a
hydrophobic patch that could accommodate the adenine
moiety. all of these residues lie in a cleft forming an
extension of the funnel and thus may represent the coabinding site. interestingly, there is residual electron density
in this area that according to its shape does not correspond
to water molecules but is too weak to allow definite
assignment as coa. nevertheless, modeling a coa molecule
into the cleft showed that it would fit nicely into its assigned
binding site (result not shown).

biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 17, 2001 5157
we have subsequently collected data from a crystal soaked
in 10 mm coa for 2 days (2.6 √• resolution) and from kbl
crystallized in the presence of coa (3.2 √• resolution). in
both cases we have found in a difference map that the
strongest features were at the position occupied by the
phosphate group and the cr atom of the aldimine. these
peaks were not connected even at a low contour level. since
ammonium sulfate was present at a concentration of 2.2 m
in the crystallization solution, we interpreted the first peak
as a sulfate ion and the second as a potential sulfate ion
(many potential hydrogen-bonding partners and arg368). no
density corresponding to coa could be identified. this lack
of density may be interpreted as indirect evidence that coa
allowed the reaction to be completed, liberating products and
cofactor from the active site.
comparison with related enzymes. the three-dimensional
structure of kbl shares similarity with other enzymes of
the r family that in most cases is restricted to the plpbinding domain, e.g., 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (29),
several aminotransferases (52), tyrosine phenol-lyase (50),
tryptophan indole-lyase (40), and ornithine transaminase (53).
all of these enzymes form dimers or tetramers (tyrosine
phenol-lyase) in solution and in the crystalline state.
the sequence homology of kbl to other plp-dependent
proteins with known structures is rather low. the best
homology in the pdb is found with 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
synthase (aons, pdb code 1bs0), which has 33% sequence
identity with kbl. since a detailed comparison of aons
with other plp-dependent enzymes has been described, we
will limit this discussion mostly to the comparison of kbl
with aons. the latter is involved in biotin biosynthesis and
catalyzes the stereospecific, decarboxylative condensation of
l-alanine with pimeloyl-coa (29, 41). it also shows a threedomain structure (a superposition with kbl is shown in
figure 7) with an n-terminal arm consisting of a single helix,
a small domain, and a plp-binding domain (29). the
superposition of the plp-binding domains of kbl and
aons (pdb code 1bs0, empty substrate binding site) results
in a root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 1.24 √• for 211 cr
atom pairs; the small domains superimpose with an rms
deviation of 1.19 √• for 91 cr atom pairs. superposition of
entire monomers gives an rms deviation of 1.41 √• for 296
cr atom pairs, indicating small differences in the arrangement of the two domains between kbl and aons. the
dimeric arrangement of these two molecules is also similar.
finally, superposition of dimers of kbl and aons leads
to an rms deviation of 1.42 √• for 584 cr atom pairs,
identical to that for the monomers. the active site architectures of kbl and aons are also similar. aons transfers
an amino acid moiety to pimeloyl-coa and shows a similar
funnel-shaped access to its catalytic center, which admits
the pantothene arm of coa.
recently, the structures of the aons complexes with
cofactor and with its external aldimine (pdb code 1dj9)
have been published (41), and the comparison with kbl
shows that the contacts made by the plp are very well
conserved, including the hydrogen bonds between the aons
active site lys236 and the plp phosphate group (figure 7).
however, the directions of the amines attached to plp are
different. the long arm of aon extends into a pocket formed
within aons, which in kbl is occupied by several side
chains. the aon conformation along the n(imino)-cr

green. (b) close-up on the external aldimines in kbl and aons (pdb code 1dj9) after superposition of their plp-binding domains.

bond is trans, and the imino nitrogen is in the plane of the
pyrimidine ring of plp. in kbl aldimine the corresponding
torsion angle is ‚àº-140¬∞, with the n(imino) deviating from
the piperidine plane. however, the methyl group and the
carbonyl oxygen in aon are in the same locations as the
methyl from the keto group and one of the carboxylic
oxygens of ketobutyrate in kbl complex (figure 7). it is
also interesting to note that, while the individual domains
overlap rather well, their relative disposition is somewhat
different in these enzymes. aons without plp shows a more
open conformation than either aons or kbl with bound
external aldimine (figure 7). domain movements in kbl
are therefore expected upon substrate binding (41).
alignments of kbl sequences (result not shown) show
blocks of very well conserved residues. the level of sequence
identity between e. coli and human kbls makes the present
structure a very good model for the human enzyme. this is
the first structure of a 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase,
highly representative for all kbl enzymes.
active site residues and their involvement in catalysis.
on the basis of the orientation of the cofactor-substrate
adduct and the contacts with the protein, we were able to
assign catalytic functions to the residues situated in the active
site according to the reaction mechanism shown in figure
8. the entire reaction sequence follows an ordered bi-bi

mechanism. the reaction mechanism consists of three
steps: the formation of the external aldimine (figure 8, panel
1), the acetylation of coa (figure 8, panel 2), and the product
release and restoration of the protein to its original state
(figure 8, panel 3).
generally, steps 1 and 3 (the transaldimination steps)
require an acid catalyst. in kbl, this function is most likely
performed by his213, which appears to be in a protonated
state. the incoming substrate first replaces lys244, assisted
by his213, forming the external aldimine seen in the crystal
structure (figure 8, panel 1). amino acids such as arg368,
his136, and asp210 are important for correct positioning
of the reactants. in step 2, coa binds to the enzyme and
removes the acetyl group, with lys244 abstracting the excess
proton and hence functioning as the required base (figure
8, panel 2). in this process, the formation of a quinoid
intermediate is a strong driving force. acetyl-coa then
dissociates from the protein and lys244 reprotonates the
quinoid intermediate to form the glycine external aldimine
(figure 8, panel 3). subsequently, in a reverse step of step
1, lys244 replaces the glycine moiety, which is finally
released as the product. the kbl structure shows the state
just before the entry of  xxxd1739xxx , which removes the
acetyl group. as coa cannot be found in the crystal structure,
we are not certain of the specific interactions between coa

figure 8: proposed reaction mechanism for kbl. the first step (panel 1) has been established before. its product is the external aldimine
as seen in the kbl structure. panel 2 shows the incoming of coa and the release of acetyl-coa. the second product of this step is the
quinoid intermediate. panel 3 shows how glycine is released and the protein restored to its original state. figure produced in chemwindows

and the protein. it is likely that ser185 assists in the
nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl group of coa.
in the studies carried out on the mitochondrial 2-amino3-ketobutyrate coa ligase, it was postulated that his213
assists the incoming acetyl-coa in the reverse reaction in
the same way as it assists the incoming amino acid substrate
during formation of the external aldimine (figure 8, panel
1). his213 should therefore also be crucial for the formation
and release of acetyl-coa in the forward reaction of e. coli
kbl. however, we suggest that ser185 takes over this role,
as the ketone carbonyl group of the 2-amino- xxxd64xxx 
moiety may form a close h-bonding contact with this residue
and hence points away from the oh group of plp and from
his213.
there is experimental evidence that kbl and threonine
dehydrogenase (tdh, ec 1.1.1.103), the two enzymes
catalyzing two consecutive reactions in threonine degradation, form a complex. this has been determined by gel
filtration and fluorescence experiments, and the measured
stoichiometry indicates that two dimers of kbl are associated with one tetramer of tdh (7). the structure of kbl
with the two active sites on the same side of the dimer
suggests that kbl binds to tdh with this face opposite the

tdh active sites, which would facilitate channeling of the
unstable 2-amino- xxxd64xxx .
