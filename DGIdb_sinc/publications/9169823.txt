purpose: to determine whether  xxxd2514xxx  can inhibit human topoisomerases in vitro.
methods and materials:  xxxd2514xxx  was incubated with human topoisomerases ii and i together with their
plasmid substrates, to determine if  xxxd2514xxx  interfered with the catalytic activities of topoisomerases and if it
enhanced the formation of dna strand breaks, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis of the resultant
plasmid forms.
results: incubation of the enzymes with  xxxd2514xxx  inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerases ii and i.
with  xxxg2312xxx , it increased the abundance of dna double strand breaks (cleavable complexes).
conclusion:  xxxd2514xxx , like  xxxd1800xxx , inhibited topoisomerases ii and i. it may act to enhance the yield
of dna double strand breaks in cells through a mechanism of  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition. 0 1997 elsevier

 xxxd2514xxx ,  xxxg2312xxx , topoisomerase i.

of special interest is the recent finding that  xxxg2312xxx  greatly enhanced dsb formation when it encountered dna containing abasic sites (9). abasic sites
are a consequence of the stepwise repair of dna base
damage in irradiated cells. we reasoned that the joint lethal action of ionizing radiation and  xxxd2514xxx  as described by ourselves and others might be accounted for by
a common mechanism i.e., inappropriate induction of
dsb by  xxxg2312xxx  encountering radiation damaged
dna in cells, and the ability of  xxxd2514xxx  to increase the
frequency of dsb trapped in cleavable complexes.
there have been no previous reports on the effects of
 xxxd2514xxx  on topoisomerases.

introduction

 xxxd2514xxx  ( xxxd2514xxx ,  xxxd2514xxx ) had formerly been used
as a treatment for schistosomiasis in hundreds of
thousands of patients without causing deaths or lasting
side effects (8). it was later found to be an inhibitor of
post-radiation repair in cell cultures and experimental animals, and was also active as an adjuvant in clinical radiation therapy (3, 11, 12, 15).
 xxxd2514xxx  (fig. 1) is an  xxxd3061xxx ; like  xxxd1800xxx  it selectively inhibited ribosomal rna synthesis in cell cultures (5 ) . it also caused the rapid loss of
velocity sedimentation of the dna isolated from hela
cells which had been exposed to 8 pm  xxxd2514xxx  (4).
this concentration was routinely achieved in the sera of
patients who received  xxxd2514xxx  tablets orally.  xxxd2514xxx  also inhibited the post-radiation recovery of the normal velocity sedimentation properties of cellular dna in
sucrose gradients (4). the effects of  xxxd2514xxx  in cell
cultures were readily reversible.
because of its ability to cleave dna without covalent
attachment, we suspected that an important effect of the
drug was inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx . we expected that
 xxxd2514xxx  would enhance the abundance of dna double
strand breaks (dsb ) trapped in cleavable complexes,
which are the consequences of  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition
(6, 10, 13).

methods

and

materials

 xxxd2514xxx  was a gift from sterling
winthrop research institute (roo9cj). it was 97.5%
pure, by hplc mass spectroscopy.
enzyme assays

human  xxxg2312xxx  and its 3 kbp substrate, plasmid ryg (a kinetoplast), containing a 54 bp high affinity
site, and human topoisomerase i and its substrate, a 3 kbp
plasmid hot 1 were purchased from topogen (columbus, oh).  xxxg2312xxx  assays were carried out in 20

the conversion was prevented by incubating the reaction
mixture with  xxxd2514xxx  (figs. 2 and 3 ) . in fig. 2, the
linear plasmid is visible in lanes 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (the
reference marker). these linear forms result from release
of linear dna from cleavable complexes by the chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction. with etoposide (lane 7)
and  xxxd2514xxx  treatments (lanes 5 and 6) this feature of
the topoisomerasedigestion was enhanced. figure 3 confirmed results shown in fig. 2.  xxxd2514xxx  at 8 pm partially inhibited the topoisomerase (lane 5 ) and inhibition
was virtually complete at 80 pm (lane 6). moreover, the
photograph of the gel in experiment of fig. 4 clearly
shows the release of linear dna when stoichiometric
amounts of  xxxg2312xxx  and  xxxd2514xxx  were included in the topoisomeraseii reaction mixtures (lanes 4,
5, 8, 9), similar to results obtained after treatment with
0.25 mm etoposide (lane 6). this indicates the stabilization of dna dsb in the cleavage complex, as found
with other inhibitors of  xxxg2312xxx . slower migrating forms located between the open circular and linear

these results demonstrate that lucantbone belongs to
the class of intercalating agents which inhibits  xxxg2312xxx . moreover, 8 pm  xxxd2514xxx , like  xxxd1800xxx 
d at low doses, selectively inhibited ribosomal rna synthesis while sparing mrna (5 ) . the effects of  xxxd2514xxx 
were therefore consistent with the effects of other topoisomerase i inhibitors, such as  xxxd412xxx  and  xxxd1800xxx  ( 14). a mechanism to account for selectivity has
been proposed by zhang et al. ( 16). because of this, we
tested the ability of  xxxd2514xxx  to inhibit topoisomerase i.
we reasoned that  xxxd2514xxx  would inhibit topoisomerase
i. confirmation that the drug indeed prevented topoisomerase i from relaxing negatively supercoiled dna was
obtained in results of experiments described in figs. 5, 6.
in the experiment of fig. 5 the reaction mixtures were
extracted with chloroform/isoamyl
alcohol and electrophoresis was followed by ethidium bromide staining of
the gel. incubation with topoisomerase i completely converted the plasmids to a range of topoisomers and open
circle forms.

forms are topoisomers;
those which migrate more slowly
than open circular monomers are plasmid multimers. the
positions of the open circle forms (oc) in figs. 2-5 are
likely to be that of supercoiled dimer dna. the band just
below the band designated, oc, in lane 7 of fig. 2 may
be the oc monomers. this cannot be decided from our
experiments and would not alter our conclusions.
supercoiled plasmid which had been incubated in the
presence of  xxxd2514xxx  but without  xxxg2312xxx  exhibited a slight  xxxd2514xxx  dose-dependent decrease of
electrophoretic mobility (not shown). the slight retardation is evident in the gels of figs. 2, 3 and 4. these
changes in mobility may be due to residual intercalated
 xxxd2514xxx  which failed to be completely removed by the
chlorofomr/isoamyl
alcohol extraction. supporting studies failed to detect covalent linkage of 3h  xxxd2514xxx  to
dna from treated cells (r. bases, unpublished data, feb.
1972). therefore, these changes in mobility might be due
to the intercalator effect of  xxxd2514xxx  on supercoiled
structure.

supercoiled to nicked open circle forms are beyond the
scope of this report.
we excluded the remote possibility that  xxxd2514xxx , an
intercalator, might have somehow restored the topoisomerase i and ii products to their original plasmid forms,
instead of having inhibited the enzymes (studies not
shown). the results in this report clearly demonstrate that
 xxxd2514xxx  inhibited human topoisomerases i and ii.

discussion
results presented here extend the similarities of  xxxd1800xxx  and  xxxd2514xxx .  xxxd1800xxx  and  xxxd2514xxx  at relatively low doses selectively inhibited ribosomal rna synthesis and with the present results both are
now known to inhibit topoisomerases i and ii (6, 14, 16).
both drugs have been shown to inhibit post-radiation re-

pair ( 1, 2, 7). clinical studies to extend the role of lucanfig. 5. lane 1, phot1;

the ability of  xxxd2514xxx  to inhibit conversion of supercoiled phot1 by topoisomerase i is likely due to the
fact that  xxxd2514xxx  is an intercalator. it can reduce the
level of negative supercoils available for relaxation by topoisomerase i, resulting in the stairstep effect (fig. 6).
this effect of intercalators on topoisomerase i is well documented. it does not involve enzyme inhibition, as found
with  xxxd412xxx , which is not a dna intercalator.
 xxxd412xxx  does not exhibit a stairstep pattern; nevertheless,  xxxd2514xxx ’s influence on the outcome of topoisomerase i activity on dna as described here may be important at the cellular level. when ethidium bromide was
present during gel electrophoresis, the patterns were simpler (fig. 6). relaxed but unnicked forms actually have
greater mobility than that of the supercoiled forms, presumably due to the greater binding of ethidium bromide
to the plasmid dna when ethidium bromide is included
in the gel (compare lanes 1 and 2). increasing amounts
of  xxxd2514xxx  inhibited the conversion to relaxed forms

(lanes 3, 4, 5).  xxxd412xxx 

inhibited the conversion to

relaxed forms but it increased the yield of nicked open

circle forms (lanes 7,8,9) and did not exhibit the stairstep
effect. decreased plasmid mobility caused by  xxxd2514xxx 
alone may have contributed somewhat to results is seen
in lanes 3,4, 5. however, the nicked circle forms in lanes
3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9 are more abundant than expected. lu-

canthone and  xxxd412xxx  in the enzyme incubation mixture led to small quantities of nicked open circle forms;

studies on the quantitative

aspects of the conversion of

thone as a useful adjuvant to radiation therapy are in progress.

topoisomeraseinhibition by lucanthone0 r. e.

our results suggest that  xxxd2514xxx  might act to increase the yield of dna dsb in cells after ionizing radiation by inhibiting  xxxg2312xxx , thereby promoting
their joint lethal effects. studies should be extended to
ascertain the effects of  xxxd2514xxx  on topoisomerases in
intact cells, especially to determine if there is a direct correlation between  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition and the activity of  xxxd2514xxx  as an inhibitor of post radiation repair.
the locus of action of  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors is not

further investigation also.
