the effects of natural ligands of hormone receptors and their antagonists on telomerase activity in the androgen sensitive prostatic cancer cell li...  the effects of the 17beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and hormone antagonists tamoxifen and  xxxd334xxx  on telomerase activity and expression of cell cycle related proteins in the androgen-sensitive prostatic cancer cell line lncap were studied. the cell line was grown in rpmi supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped fbs for 72 hr. the ic(50) of tamoxifen and  xxxd334xxx  and the optimal stimulatory concentrations of 17beta-estradiol and dihydrotestosterone were determined by means of the cell-viability assay, the activity of telomerase was measured by the telomere repeat amplification protocol (trap) and the expression of proteins was analysed by the western blot technique. 17beta-estradiol stimulated cell growth more effectively than dihydrotestosterone whereas hormone antagonists tamoxifen and  xxxd334xxx  caused a significant decrease in cell viability. the treatment of cells by a combination of low doses of 17  xxxd2037xxx  and dihydrotestosterone stimulated cells stronger than treatment by a single hormone. only 17beta-estradiol, in concentration of 10nm, increased strongly the expression of p21( xxxg418xxx / xxxg418xxx ) and increased slightly telomerase activity in the lncap cells. 50 microm of  xxxd334xxx  down-regulated the levels of the  xxxg183xxx , the  xxxg1681xxx  and telomerase activity, and up-regulated the expression of p27( xxxg419xxx ). we hereby describe the first observation of the influence of  xxxd334xxx  on telomerase activity and a positive correlation between the effect of 17beta-estradiol and the induction of both the endogenous cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21( xxxg418xxx / xxxg418xxx ), and telomerase activity in a prostatic cancer cell line lncap. these findings can shed a new light on the steroid-signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells.
