 xxxd52xxx : a novel treatment for
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis
jennifer reynolds, m.d., kam shojania, m.d., frcp(c), and carlo a. marra, pharm.d., ph.d.
rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that often leads to
functional disability and reduced quality of life. the pathogenesis of synovial
inflammation that is associated with this disease is thought to result from tcell activation. to become fully activated, t cells require an antigen-specific
signal through the t-cell receptor and a second signal through a costimulatory
receptor.  xxxd52xxx  is the first drug in a new class of disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (dmards) known as selective costimulation
modulators. costimulation modulators block the second signal and decrease
t-cell activation.  xxxd52xxx  has been approved by the united states food and
drug administration for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major
clinical response, slowing the progression of structural damage, and
improving physical function in adults with moderate-to-severe active
rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to at least one
other dmard, such as methotrexate or  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a
inhibitors. randomized controlled trials have shown that  xxxd52xxx  improves
both clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life in patients who have
had an inadequate response to other dmards.  xxxd52xxx  has been shown to
be well tolerated. in clinical trials, however,  xxxd52xxx  treatment was
associated with a higher rate of infections compared with placebo. this
finding was compounded when  xxxd52xxx  was used with  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors;
thus, this combination should be avoided.  xxxd52xxx  appears to be a useful
treatment option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have previously
failed other dmards. however, additional clinical trials evaluating its longterm effect on patient safety and disease outcomes are needed.
key words:  xxxd52xxx , selective costimulation modulators, rheumatoid

conclusion

rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune
disease that often leads to severe, chronic functional
disability and reduced quality of life. 1 the
american college of rheumatology (acr) has
recommended that patients be treated with
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards)

1694

within 3 months of their diagnosis of rheumatoid
arthritis.2 numerous dmards are available and
can be categorized as either traditional or
biologic agents. biologic dmards interfere with
signaling pathways involved in inflammation and
include  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a inhibitors,
antiinterleukin-1 agents, anti-cd20 agents, and
costimulation modulators. traditional dmards
include methotrexate,  xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2301xxx ,  xxxd2450xxx , gold salts, and
cyclosporine; these drugs can be used alone or in
combination to control the signs and symptoms
of rheumatoid arthritis and to prevent joint
damage. most patients with rheumatoid arthritis
begin drug therapy by taking traditional nonbiologic dmards, with further therapy added,
including biologic dmards, if the disease is not
well controlled. a need exists, however, for new
therapies, particularly for patients who fail to
respond or lose response to  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors, for
whom only limited treatment options are
available.3
 xxxd52xxx  is the first in a new class of agents
known as selective costimulation modulators.
the drug has been shown to be safe, well tolerated,
and effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
we reviewed the published data related to the use
of  xxxd52xxx  for reducing the signs and symptoms

of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with
moderate-to-severe active disease who had had
an inadequate response to at least one other
dmard, such as methotrexate or a  xxxg2296xxx 
inhibitor.
pharmacology and pharmacokinetics
 xxxd52xxx  selectively modulates t-cell activation.
the t cells are found in the synovium of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis and are thought to play
a major role in the pathogenesis of synovial
inflammation. normal t-cell activation requires
two signals.4 the first signal, which is antigen
specific, occurs when an antigen within the
major histocompatibility complex class ii
molecule on an antigen-presenting cell binds to a
specific t-cell receptor on the t cell (figure 1a).
a second signal, or costimulatory signal, occurs
when cd28 on the t cells binds to  xxxg396xxx  or
 xxxg398xxx  on the antigen-presenting cell (figure 1b).
the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte–associated antigen-4
is a naturally occurring inhibitor of this interaction expressed on the surface of t cells after
activation. it binds to  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  much
more avidly than does cd28.  xxxd52xxx  is a
soluble fusion protein that consists of the
extracellular domain of human cytotoxic tlymphocyte–associated antigen-4 linked to the
modified fc (hinge, ch2, and ch3 domains)

1 occurs when the major histocompatibility complex
(mhc) class ii–antigen complex binds to the t-cell receptor
(a), and signal 2 occurs when cd28 on the t cell binds to
 xxxg396xxx  or  xxxg398xxx  on the antigen-presenting cell (b). apc =

effectively prevents the second cd28- xxxg396xxx /86
costimulatory signal from optimally activating t
cells.
the clearance of  xxxd52xxx  is unaffected by sex
(when corrected for body weight) and age,5 and
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd52xxx  have been
demonstrated to be dose-proportional and linear.6
to our knowledge, no studies have been published
regarding the effect of impaired renal function on
the agent’s clearance. intravenous  xxxd52xxx 
infusions (at weeks 0, 2, and 4, and monthly
thereafter) produce trough serum concentrations
sufficient for in vitro suppression of t-cell
proliferation and cytokine production.7
clinical trials
efficacy of  xxxd52xxx  for the treatment of the
signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis has
been demonstrated in many randomized
controlled trials.8–14 these studies included adult
patients with well-established disease who had
significant ongoing disease activity despite
previous treatment with dmards, including
methotrexate and  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors.
in the studies, response to treatment was
assessed by at least one of the following: the
acr response criteria, the health assessment
questionnaire (haq), the modified haq
(mhaq), and the medical outcomes study 36item short-form general health survey (sf-36).
with the acr response criteria, an acr 20
response is defined as a decrease of at least 20%
in the number of both tender and swollen joints
(68 joints are assessed for tenderness, and 66
joints are assessed for swelling), as well as a 20%
improvement in at least three of the following:
the patient’s global assessment of disease activity
on a visual analog scale (vas), the patient’s
assessment of pain on a vas, physical function as
assessed by a patient-reported outcome instrument
such as the haq disability index (haq-di), the
physician’s global assessment of disease activity,
and an acute phase reactant (either the erythrocyte
sedimentation rate or the  xxxg520xxx 
level).15 similarly, acr 50 and acr 70 require a
50% and 70% improvement in the acr criteria,
respectively.
the haq-di has 20 questions in eight categories
of functioning that represent a comprehensive set
of functional activities—dressing, arising, eating,
walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities.
each category has two or three questions, with

1695

the following four response choices for each
question: without any difficulty (score 0), with
some difficulty (score 1), with much difficulty
(score 2), and not able to do (score 3).16 a score
is then assigned to each of the eight categories
based on the greatest disability of any activity
within the category. questions are also asked
regarding the use of aids and devices, or the need
for help from another person for activities in any
of the eight categories. if the category score is
lower than 2, the score is increased to 2 in any
category in which the patient uses a device or has
help from another person, so that the underlying
disability is more accurately represented. the
total haq-di score is the mean of the scores for
the eight categories. the haq-di is the best
predictor of mortality,17 work disability, 18 and
health care resource utilization19 in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. the mhaq20 uses only one
question from each of the eight categories in the
haq-di, thus reducing the number of items to
eight. no adjustment of scores is permitted. the
mhaq score is calculated as the mean of the
scores for each activity. the haq-di and the
mhaq scores are highly correlated.21
the sf-36 is a widely used generic quality-oflife instrument and consists of eight domains
(physical functioning, role limitations due to
physical health, bodily pain, general health
perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role
limitations due to emotional health, and mental
health) and two summary scores (physical
component score and mental component score).
phase ii trials
a dose-ranging phase ii trial investigated the
efficacy and safety of  xxxd52xxx  monotherapy
versus placebo in patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis who had an inadequate response to at
least one dmard.8 a dose response was noted
for the primary outcome with 23%, 44%, and
53% of patients achieving an acr 20 while
receiving  xxxd52xxx  doses of 0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg,
respectively, versus 31% of placebo-treated patients.
a large, phase iib, double-blind study evaluated
patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who
were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd52xxx  10
mg/kg,  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg, or placebo, plus
background methotrexate for 1 year followed by
open-label therapy during which all participating
patients received  xxxd52xxx  according to body weight
to receive a dose approximating 10 mg/kg.9, 10
a significantly greater percentage of patients
treated with  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg achieved the

months compared with patients who received
placebo (60% vs 35%, p<0.001).9 the acr 20
response rates were maintained at 12 months
(62.6% vs 36.1%, p<0.001).10 improvements in
physical function were achieved and maintained
over 12 months of double-blind therapy with
49.6% versus 27.7% of patients achieving
clinically meaningful improvements (defined as ≥
0.22 units) in modified haq-di (mhaq-di)
scores at 12 months with  xxxd52xxx  and placebo
treatment, respectively, (p<0.001).10
in a formal evaluation of the effect of  xxxd52xxx 
on health-related quality of life from this trial, all
eight health domains and the two summary
scores of the sf-36 scores from patients in this
trial were examined.22 overall, the changes in
the sf-36 scales differed between the  xxxd52xxx 
10-mg/kg and the placebo groups (p<0.0001).
the largest mean differences between change
scores were observed between the  xxxd52xxx  10mg/kg and placebo groups in the following sf-36
domains: bodily pain (5.8 points), vitality (5.8
points), and physical functioning (5.1 points, all
p<0.0001 and considered clinically significant).
in addition, the mean differences in changes in
the physical component score were both
clinically (5.4 points) and statistically (p<0.0001)
significant.
in the open-label extension of this trial,  xxxd52xxx 
provided clinically meaningful improvements in

physical function, and reductions in pain, that
were maintained through 3 years of treatment.23
compared with baseline, the mhaq-di showed
sustained improvement over 3 years (percentage
with improvement ≥ 0.3 units: at 1 yr 54.8%, at
2 yrs 53.4%, and at 3 yrs 53.1%) with sustained
reductions in patient-assessed pain (mean
percentage improvement: at 1 yr 52.4%, at 2 yrs
50.2%, and at 3 yrs 55.6%).
finally,  xxxd52xxx  was studied in combination
with etanercept in patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis despite etanercept treatment for at least
3 months.11 although there was a trend to improvement in acr 20 responses, these were not
significant. as discussed below, this combination
of biologic agents was also associated with an
increased risk of adverse events, so treating
patients with the combination of etanercept and
 xxxd52xxx  is not recommended.
phase iii trials
a summary of the phase iii trials is given in
table 1.5, 12–14 all patients in these trials were
either screened for tuberculosis at entry into the
trial or had previously been treated with a  xxxg2296xxx 
inhibitor and should already have been screened.
the  xxxd52xxx  in inadequate responders to
methotrexate (aim) trial was designed to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of  xxxd52xxx  plus
methotrexate in patients who had previously had
an inadequate response to methotrexate.12 it was

also designed to assess the effects of  xxxd52xxx  on
the radiographic progression of structural damage.
treatment with  xxxd52xxx  resulted in statistically
significantly higher acr 20, 50, and 70 response
rates compared with placebo at 6 months and 1
year (figure 3).12 at 1 year,  xxxd52xxx -treated
patients had significant slowing of radiographic
progression compared with placebo-treated
patients. the median change from baseline in
erosion score was 0.0 for  xxxd52xxx  versus 0.27
for placebo (p=0.029). the median change from
baseline in total score was 0.25 versus 0.53
(p=0.012).
results from the aim trial examining the
impact of added  xxxd52xxx  on health-related
quality of life showed that by the end of 1 year,
significant differences occurred between the
 xxxd52xxx  and placebo groups for all eight of the
sf-36 domains and the two summary scores

(mental and physical component scores). 24 of
note, the mean physical component score
improved significantly for the  xxxd52xxx  group
relative to the placebo group within the first
month of treatment and was maintained thereafter,
whereas the mean mental component score was
significantly improved in the  xxxd52xxx  group
relative to placebo after 6 months of treatment.
when limiting the analysis to only responders,
after 6 months of treatment, 47.1% of the  xxxd52xxx 
group achieved normal physical component scores
relative to the united states general population
compared with 30.7% of the placebo group
(p<0.01). similarly, for the mental component
scores, 60.4% of the  xxxd52xxx  group achieved
normal scores as compared with 50.5% of the
placebo group (p<0.01).
the  xxxd52xxx  trial in treatment of anti-tnf
inadequate responders (attain) study was a
24-week assessment of the safety and efficacy of
 xxxd52xxx  in patients who had been treated with
etanercept and/or infliximab— xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors—
at an approved dose for more than 3 months and
failed treatment due to inadequate efficacy.13 in
this patient population,  xxxd52xxx  produced
statistically significant improvements in signs
and symptoms at 6 months as measured by acr
20, 50, and 70 (p<0.005; figure 4).
 xxxd52xxx  produced statistically significant and
clinically meaningful improvements in physical
function (change in mhaq-di ≥ 0.3 units), thus
exceeding the minimal clinically important
change of 0.22 units after the first dose (day 15,
p<0.05; figure 5a), and in health-related quality
of life, which were maintained through 6 months
of treatment (p<0.01; figure 5b). mean scores

score improved significantly in the abatacepttreated patients compared with the placebo
patients (all p<0.01).25 in addition, in seven of
the eight sf-36 domains (the only exception was
the role emotional domain), significantly more
patients reported favorable change in the
 xxxd52xxx  group as compared with the placebo
group (all p<0.006).
the final phase iii clinical trial, the  xxxd52xxx 
study of safety in use with other rheumatoid
arthritis therapies (assure), was designed to
assess the safety of  xxxd52xxx  when taken
concurrently with other available antirheumatic
drugs, including biologic agents.14 patients were
allowed to have comorbid conditions, including
diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (copd), or heart failure. 5
patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were
randomly assigned to receive  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg
or placebo for 1 year, as an add-on to their
existing dmard therapy. the primary end point
was safety, with clinical efficacy assessed through
haq-di questionnaires, patient pain vas, patient
global disease activity vas, and physician global
disease activity vas values. significantly more
 xxxd52xxx -treated patients achieved a clinically
meaningful haq-di response (improvement of at
least 0.3 haq-di units from baseline) versus
placebo (47.3% vs 34.6%, p<0.001).
adverse effects and tolerability

infections were slightly higher with  xxxd52xxx 
than placebo. serious infections were generally
caused by expected pathogens, followed an
expected course, and responded to treatment.
they included respiratory tract infections
(pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, sinusitis,
pharyngitis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis),
dermatologic infections (cellulitis, abscess),
sepsis, bacterial arthritis, and acute pyelonephritis.
one case of suspected tuberculosis (not confirmed)
was reported with  xxxd52xxx  treatment and one
without  xxxd52xxx  treatment. overall death rates
were similar in the  xxxd52xxx  (0.5%) and placebo
(0.6%) groups (table 2).
two randomized controlled trials used  xxxd52xxx 
in combination with other biologic agents, and
both found an increased risk in serious infections.
in the assure trial, 167 patients were receiving
background biologic dmard therapy, of whom
103 patients received  xxxd52xxx  and 64 received
placebo.27 an increased rate of neoplasms was
noted in the group of patients receiving  xxxd52xxx 
plus background biologic therapy (6.8% [7
patients] vs 1.6% [1 patient] for placebo), as well
as serious infections (5.8% [6 patients] for
 xxxd52xxx  plus background biologic therapy vs
1.6% [1 patient] for placebo). in the  xxxd52xxx 
plus background biologics group, the seven
neoplasms included three reported as malignant
(two basal cell carcinomas and one squamous cell
carcinoma) and the serious infections included
three respiratory, two urinary, and one gastrointestinal. all the infections were bacterial, and
none was fatal or due to opportunistic organisms
or tuberculosis.
the study of  xxxd52xxx  and etanercept combination therapy also showed an increase in total
adverse events for  xxxd52xxx  versus placebo
(92.9% vs 88.9%), serious adverse events (16.5%
vs 2.8%), and serious infections (3.5% vs 0%).11

1699

there were no malignancies in the 1-year doubleblind phase, but three malignancies (basal cell
carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, and fatal diffuse,
large b cell lymphoma) in the long-term extension
during which all patients received combination
therapy with etanercept and  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg.
acute infusion reactions (within 1 hr of the
infusion) were more common in abatacepttreated patients than in placebo-treated patients
(8.9% vs 5.5%), with the most common symptoms
being dizziness (2.1% vs 1.3%), headache (1.8%
vs 1.2%), and hypertension (1.2% vs 0.4%). 5
discontinuations due to infusion reactions
occurred in 0.4% of  xxxd52xxx -treated patients
versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients.
fifty-four patients with copd were included
in the assure trial. 5 of these, 37 received
 xxxd52xxx  and 17 received placebo. more adverse
events occurred in the patients with copd who
were treated with  xxxd52xxx  than in patients with
copd who were treated with placebo (97% vs
88%). in particular, respiratory disorders including
copd exacerbation, cough, rhonchi, and dyspnea
were more common in the  xxxd52xxx -treated
patients than in the placebo-treated patients
(43% vs 24%). as well, serious adverse events
were more common in  xxxd52xxx -treated patients
with copd than in placebo-treated patients
(27% vs 6%).
immunogenicity is a concern with biologic
agents. however, the percentage of patients with
previously negative antinuclear antibody titers
who became positive during treatment was
similar in the  xxxd52xxx  and placebo groups
(9.7% vs 10.8%). 5 similarly, development of
anti–double-stranded dna antibodies occurred
in 2.7% of  xxxd52xxx -treated patients versus 4.7%
of placebo-treated patients. finally, although
antibodies to  xxxd52xxx  developed in 1% of
patients tested over 2 years, no association with
clinical efficacy or adverse events was found.
overall,  xxxd52xxx  appears to be safe in
combination with traditional dmards but
should not be used concurrently with biologic
dmards. caution is required when using
 xxxd52xxx  to treat patients with rheumatoid
arthritis who have copd. the number of elderly
patients in the randomized trials with  xxxd52xxx 
was limited (53 patients > 75 yrs old), but the
rates of serious infection and malignancy were
higher for these patients. 5 caution should
therefore be used in treating elderly patients with
rheumatoid arthritis with  xxxd52xxx .
although the overall malignancy rate was
similar in  xxxd52xxx - and placebo-treated

1700

pharmacotherapy volume 27, number 12, 2007

patients, more patients (four [0.2%]) treated with
 xxxd52xxx  versus placebo (0%) developed lung
cancer. also, a higher rate of lymphoma was
seen in the patients receiving  xxxd52xxx  compared
with the rate in the general population, but there
is a known increase in lymphoma in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those with
more active disease. as such, whether  xxxd52xxx 
increases the risk for lymphoma in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis is not known.
preclinical in vivo assessments of  xxxd52xxx 
have not demonstrated any cardiovascular
complications, and no cardiovascular events have
been associated with the use of  xxxd52xxx .5
indication and precautions
the u.s. food and drug administration
approved  xxxd52xxx  for reducing signs and
symptoms, inducing major clinical response,
slowing the progression of structural damage,
and improving physical function in adults with
moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis
who have had an inadequate response to at least
one other dmard, such as methotrexate or a
 xxxg2296xxx  inhibitor.5 it is also being used off-label
to treat patients with an overlap of both systemic
lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.
 xxxd52xxx  may be used in combination with
methotrexate or other traditional dmard therapy,
but concurrent therapy with other biologic
dmards is not recommended.5  xxxd52xxx  has
been awarded category c status and should be
used during pregnancy only if clearly needed;
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies
in pregnant women.5 it is recommended that all
patients be screened for latent tuberculosis before
starting treatment with a biologic dmard.
finally, the manufacturer recommends that live
virus vaccines should not be administered while
taking  xxxd52xxx  or within 3 months of its
discontinuation.
drug-drug interactions
glycoproteins, such as  xxxd52xxx , do not have
specific interactions with molecules that are
metabolized by the liver, and population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), methotrexate,
corticosteroids, and  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors do not
influence  xxxd52xxx  clearance.7 methotrexate and
other nonbiologic dmards, corticosteroids,
salicylates, nsaids, or analgesics may be used
during treatment with  xxxd52xxx .5
in controlled clinical trials, patients receiving

concomitant  xxxd52xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitor
therapy experienced more infections (63%) and
serious infections (4.4%) compared with patients
treated with only  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors (43% and
0.8%, respectively). 5 as such, concurrent
therapy with  xxxd52xxx  and a  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitor is
not recommended, and there is insufficient
experience to assess the safety and efficacy of
 xxxd52xxx  in combination with anakinra.5
dosing and administration
 xxxd52xxx  is provided as 250 mg of lyophilized
powder in a preservative-free, single-use 15-ml
vial that must be reconstituted before administration with 10 ml of sterile water for injection
usp using the silicone-free disposable syringe
provided with each vial and an 18–21-gauge
needle. if the  xxxd52xxx  powder is accidentally
reconstituted using a siliconized syringe, the
solution may develop a few translucent particles
and should be discarded.5  xxxd52xxx  should not
be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous
line with other agents.5
in clinical trials, doses up to 50 mg/kg have
been administered without apparent toxic
effects.5  xxxd52xxx  should be administered as a
30-minute intravenous infusion according to
body weight range: 500 mg for patients weighing
less than 60 kg, 750 mg for patients 60–100 kg,
and 1000 mg for patients over 100 kg. of note,
premedication is generally not required. after
initial administration,  xxxd52xxx  should be given
at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion, then
every 4 weeks thereafter.5
place in therapy
 xxxd52xxx  could be considered a first-line
biologic dmard after methotrexate failure in
patients who have contraindications to anti–
 xxxg2296xxx  biologics (i.e., patients with multiple
sclerosis, heart failure) and a second-line biologic
after failure to a  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitor. with more
time and clinical experience, clinicians may favor
 xxxd52xxx  over other biologics. be aware that
 xxxd52xxx  may take slightly longer for its peak
benefit to occur than the  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors; some
patients who do not adequately respond at 12
weeks may respond by 18 or 24 weeks.12, 13 most
rheumatologists prefer that their patients
receiving biologics continue to take methotrexate
or another traditional dmard. this also holds
true for  xxxd52xxx .
there are questions that remain for  xxxd52xxx .
what is the effect on extraarticular manifestations

 xxxd52xxx  for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis reynolds et al
of rheumatoid arthritis such as rheumatoid
nodulosis, secondary sjögren’s syndrome, and
ocular and pulmonary manifestations? does
 xxxd52xxx  improve rheumatoid vasculitis? how
well does  xxxd52xxx  work in patients who have
rheumatoid arthritis overlap with other connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus
erythematosus? further research should be
conducted to investigate the long-term safety and
outcomes with this agent.
conclusion
 xxxd52xxx  appears to be an effective and welltolerated option for improving signs and symptoms in adults with moderate-to-severe active
rheumatoid arthritis. there is clear evidence
from randomized controlled trials that  xxxd52xxx 
improves physical functioning and health-related
quality of life in patients without adequate
response to other dmards. as such, it should
be considered for patients who have had an
inadequate response to one or more dmards,
such as methotrexate or  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitors.
