summary

 xxxd77xxx , a synthetic retinoid, is a new drug proposed for the treatment of acne patients. studies
on the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of  xxxd77xxx  have shown that it is very active on cell and
tissue proliferation and differentiation. furthermore,  xxxd77xxx  has anti-inflammatory potential as
determined by its anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity.  xxxd77xxx  interacts selectively with the nuclear receptors
 xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx , and its activity on proliferation and differentiation can be blocked by a  xxxg1932xxx -g
antagonist. because  xxxg1932xxx  is not expressed in human keratinocytes, the effect of  xxxd77xxx  on the
major cell type of the epidermis is certainly mediated by its interaction with  xxxg1933xxx . the unique
pharmacological properties of  xxxd77xxx  may explain why, when compared to tretinoin, it has an
improved therapeutic ratio due to its better tolerance.

 xxxd3417xxx  (ra), a metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx , is a
potent modulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation.1,2 it is also considered a `mediator' of
morphogenesis and development.3 these pleiotropic
effects are known to be mediated by the interaction of
ra with specific nuclear receptors which belong to the
steroid/thyroid/ xxxg2412xxx  superfamily. the
ra receptors4±6 (rara,  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx ) are ligand
inducible trans-acting factors which heterodimerize
with the 9cis-ra receptors7,8 ( xxxg1998xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx ,  xxxg2000xxx ) and
interact with specific dna sequences or  xxxd3417xxx 
response element (rare) contained in the promoter
region of target genes.9,10 rxrs interact with each
other to form homodimers able to bind to gene
promoters containing a specific retinoid x response
element (rxre).11
several natural and synthetic retinoids are used in
the management of dermatological diseases.12 for
example, ra and one of its isomers, 13-cisra, are
used topically and orally, respectively for  xxxd3159xxx ; however, use of ra gives rise to substantial skin
irritation showing the need for retinoids with an
improved therapeutic/side-effect ratio. our medicinal
chemistry and pharmacology program led to the
discovery of a new synthetic retinoid,  xxxd77xxx , active
in the treatment of acne and better tolerated than ra.
the interaction of  xxxd77xxx  with rars and rxrs, as
well as its effect on cell proliferation and differentiation and its anti-inflammatory properties are described below.

interaction of  xxxd77xxx  with rars and
 xxxg1998xxx :
the binding dissociation constants (kd) of  xxxd77xxx  for
rara,  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1933xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  were determined using
human recombinant receptors produced by transfection
of cos-7 cells with expression plasmids encoding the
different receptors. nuclear extracts prepared from
transfected cells were used in competition binding
experiments performed with the stable reference retinoid [h3]-cd367.13 the kd values of  xxxd77xxx  and
ra for the different rars and  xxxg1998xxx  are shown in table
1. in contrast to ra,  xxxd77xxx  displayed selectivity for
 xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx  and no affinity for  xxxg1998xxx .
the transactivation potential of  xxxd77xxx  was
studied in hela cells co-transfected using the calcium±phosphate precipitation procedure with expression vectors coding for human rara,  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1933xxx 
and  xxxg1998xxx . in the case of rars, the cells were cotransfected with a tre-tk-cat reporter plasmid, and in

the case of  xxxg1998xxx , a rxre-tk-cat vector was used.
these plasmids consist of a thyroid hormone response
element (tre) or an rxre cloned upstream of the
minimal promoter of the hsv1 thymidine kinase (tk)
and the reporter gene of the chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase (cat). after transfection, the cells were
treated for 16 h with the retinoids. cat expression was
measured using an elisa.
the transactivation potential of  xxxd77xxx  and of
 xxxd3417xxx  are shown in table 2.  xxxd77xxx  was less
active via rara than ra and did not transactivate
through  xxxg1998xxx .

activity of  xxxd77xxx  on cell and tissue
differentiation
the effects of  xxxd77xxx  on cell differentiation in vitro
were determined in f9 cells or normal human
keratinocytes (nhk) in culture and in a reconstructed
skin model.
f9 murine embryonal carcinoma cells are induced to
differentiate into endoderm cells after treatment with
retinoids.14 this phenotypic change is concomitant
with the secretion into the culture medium of the tissue
type plasminogen activator which was used as a marker
to quantify the biological effects of retinoids.15 in the f9
differentiation test,  xxxd77xxx  was more active than ra
showing that it is a good modulator of cell differentiation (table 3). the treatment of nhk with retinoids
inhibits the expression of several differentiation markers, i.e. keratin pair 1/10,  xxxg1217xxx , loricrin, filaggrin
and plasma membrane associated transglutaminase
(tg1). the latter is a characteristic enzyme of terminally differentiating keratinocytes which catalyses the

formation of the cornified envelope constituting the
membrane of corneocytes.16 corneocytes represent the
final stage of keratinocyte differentiation and are found
in the stratum corneum, the uppermost layer of the
skin. a specific monoclonal antibody directed against
tg1 was used to develop an elisa in order to determine
the level of tg1 expressed by keratinocytes.17 keratinocytes were grown up to sub confluency in low
calcium semi defined medium and they were then
shifted to high calcium medium. at the same time,
retinoids were added to the culture medium. after four
days, the elisa assay was performed. as indicated in
table 4,  xxxd77xxx  displayed a very high activity in this
differentiation model, while ra was less active.
in the reconstructed skin model, nhk were seeded
on lattices made of type i collagen contracted by
fibroblasts. the dermal equivalents were first kept
submerged in the culture medium for a week to allow
the epidermal cells to form a confluent monolayer and
then were raised at the air±liquid interface on stainless
steel grids over a second week, a time found to be
sufficient to allow stratification and differentiation of
the culture.18 during this period, retinoids were added
to the culture medium. the expression of keratinocyte
differentiation markers was determined at the protein
level by immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections.  xxxd77xxx  inhibited the expression of several
differentiation markers including keratin 10, filaggrin,
loricrin,  xxxg1217xxx  and transglutaminase (fig. 1). the
expression level of their mrna was also studied by rtpcr analysis. as an example, fig. 2 shows that loricrin
mrna expression is down-regulated by  xxxd77xxx .
the activity of  xxxd77xxx  on the differentiation of f9
cells and nhk was completely inhibited by the addition
of the selective  xxxg1932xxx /g antagonist  xxxd1699xxx . furthermore, the antagonist  xxxd1699xxx , blocked the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd77xxx  on epidermal differentiation in the
reconstructed skin model (fig. 2). since  xxxg1932xxx  is not
expressed in human keratinocytes, this observation
indicates that the action of  xxxd77xxx  on keratinocyte
differentiation may be mediated exclusively by its
interaction with  xxxg1933xxx .

the effects of  xxxd77xxx  on the differentiation process
in vivo were studied using the rhino mouse strain, a
mutant displaying some of the characteristic features of
the skin of acne patients. at the age of 4 weeks, the
rhino mouse loses hairs and the upper part of the
original follicular unit gives rise to utricules filled with
corneocytes and sebum. after 7±8 weeks, these
sebaceous follicles, progressively distended by the
production and accumulation of excessive horny
material, are histologically reminescent of retentional
human acneic lesions such as microcomedones. when
applied topically for 3 weeks, retinoids reduce the
number of epidermal comedones and induce an
increase in epidermal thickness19 (fig. 3). both
parameters can be measured by image analysis of skin
sections.  xxxd77xxx  was more active than ra in the
reduction of utricle number, but a little less active than
ra in inducing epidermal hyperplasia (table 4). in
more detailed ultrastructural studies20 it was observed
that  xxxd77xxx  induces increased desquamation and
decreased cohesiveness of corneocytes in the epidermis
and epithelial wall of the pseudocomedones.

anti-inflammatory activity of  xxxd77xxx 
the anti-inflammatory activity of  xxxd77xxx  was
studied in comparison with known anti-inflammatory
reference compounds, namely indomethacin (in) and
 xxxd322xxx  (bmv), and with ra, 13cisra, and  xxxd2071xxx .21 in vitro, in both soya bean and
human pmn enzyme systems,  xxxd77xxx  induced an
inhibition of the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic

acid by 5-and 15-lipoxygenase pathways that was superior to the inhibitory activity produced by the reference
compounds and the other studied retinoids.  xxxd77xxx 
produced a significant inhibition of f-met-leu-phe
induced chemiluminescence of rabbit pmn, comparable
to ra, and stronger than in and bmv. in addition, it
inhibited peripheral human blood pmn chemotaxis.
in several classical in vivo assays (see table 5),
 xxxd77xxx  proved to have moderate to strong antiinflammatory activity, comparable to those of reference
anti-inflammatory agents and generally superior to the
other retinoids studied.
as indicated previously, retinoids exert their activities
by interacting with rars or rxrs and by activating
genes which contain rare or rxre in their promoters.
they can also regulate gene expression by inhibiting the
activity of other transcription factors such as  xxxg1222xxx .22  xxxg1222xxx 
is composed of jun/jun homodimers or fos/jun heterodimers and is inducible by growth factors, phorbol esters
or ultraviolet (uv) radiation.  xxxg1222xxx  sequences are found in
the promoter region of many genes including matrix
metalloproteinases (collagenases, stromelysin), growth
factors ( xxxg2269xxx , vegf) and inflammatory mediators ( xxxg1169xxx ).
the ap-1 transcription complex controls the expression
of a subset of genes that are expressed early in response to
extracellular mitogenic stimuli or to stress.  xxxg1222xxx  is thus
thought to play an important role in inflammation and
immune response. retinoids with anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity
could block part of the inflammatory response.
the anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity of  xxxd77xxx  was tested in
hela cells transfected with a plasmid-containing part of
the collagenase promoter cloned upstream of the cat
gene.23  xxxg1222xxx  activity was induced by treating the cells
with tpa. compared to ra,  xxxd77xxx  is a potent
inhibitor of  xxxg1222xxx  activity (fig. 4a). recently, it was
shown that  xxxd77xxx  inhibits tpa-induced vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf) and  xxxg1418xxx  mrna
expression by human keratinocytes in culture.
to confirm in vivo the anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity of  xxxd77xxx ,
mouse ears were treated topically with tpa and the

resulting oedema was measured 6 h later. the
simultaneous treatment of mice with tpa and  xxxd77xxx  or ra led to the inhibition of the oedema response
as shown in fig. 4 (b).  xxxd77xxx  displayed the same
anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity as ra. our recent unpublished data
show that, in this model, the inhibition of the tpainduced oedema by retinoids is well correlated with the
decrease of the expression of vegf mrna.
altogether, these results suggest that the antiinflammatory activity of  xxxd77xxx  might be partly
due to its anti- xxxg1222xxx  activity.

anti-proliferative activity of  xxxd77xxx 
hela cells were chosen to develop a test system for the
evaluation of the anti proliferative potential of synthetic
retinoids.24 in this assay, the cells were seeded at low
density and were treated for 4 days with the test retinoid.
cell proliferation was then determined using a marker of
mitochondrial activity (xtt assay). the inhibitory effect
of the retinoids on cell proliferation was calculated from
dose±response curves and expressed as ic50 values.
 xxxd77xxx  and ra showed a very high activity in the
inhibition of hela cell proliferation with ic50 values of 16
and 6 nm, respectively. the activity of  xxxd77xxx  on hela
cell proliferation was clearly linked to its interaction
with the rars since it was completely abolished by the
addition of the selective  xxxg1932xxx /g antagonist  xxxd1699xxx .
recently, it was demonstrated that  xxxd77xxx  has a
strong inhibitory activity on rat sebocyte proliferation in
vitro (prof. r.l. rosenfield, personal communication).
in vivo, the anti proliferative potential of  xxxd77xxx 
was assessed using the epidermal  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) assay.25 odc is a polyamine biosynthetic
enzyme that plays a major role in growth and malignant transformation by catalysing decarboxylation of
ornithine to putrescine, the first step and probably the

rate-limiting step in the pathway of polyamine biosynthesis. odc activity was induced in the epidermis of
hairless rats by cellulose tape stripping. retinoids were
applied topically immediately after tape stripping and
the odc activity of epidermal extracts was measured
after 6 h.  xxxd77xxx  and ra were able to significantly
inhibit the tape-stripping induced odc activity.

conclusions
two major factors have been proposed to account for
the aetiology of acne, an altered keratinocyte differentiation in the infundibulum of the pilosebaceous unit
and an increased sebum secretion. the abnormal
differentiation of infundibular keratinocytes would lead
to an increased cohesiveness between corneocytes,
resulting in their retention and accumulation in the
infundibulum and eventually in the obturation of the
pilosebaceous duct. this would be followed by bacterial
colonization and eventually could result in the disruption of the comedones and in an inflammatory
response. it is now clearly established that  xxxd77xxx 
is a very effective drug for  xxxd3159xxx .26 the data
described above suggest that this effect could be related
to the activity of  xxxd77xxx  on keratinocyte differentiation, sebocyte proliferation and inflammation.
in the treatment of acne patients, and compared
to tretinoin,  xxxd77xxx  displays an improved therapeutic ratio mainly due to its better tolerance. this is
certainly due to the unique pharmacological properties
of this compound, which are characterized by a
selectivity for the nuclear  xxxg1932xxx /g, and a potent
activity on cell differentiation.
