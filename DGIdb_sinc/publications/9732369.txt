pharmacological characterization of human m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with double mutations at the junction of tm vi and the third extrac...  a mutant human  xxxg451xxx  containing the mutations of ser465 to tyr and thr466 to pro showed constitutive activity. by replacing the equivalent ser388 with tyr and thr389 with pro, we created a mutant human m1 ( xxxg447xxx ) receptor with comparable double mutations. the mutant receptor,  xxxg447xxx (ser388tyr, thr389pro), was stably expressed in a9 l cells and displayed enhanced responses to classical muscarinic agonists with significantly increased potencies. choline, a normal component of growth media, showed an efficacy comparable to acetylcholine and carbachol at  xxxg447xxx (ser388tyr, thr389pro) receptors. methylcarbachol, a selective nicotinic agonist, exhibited partial agonist activity at human m1 wild-type receptors and full agonist activity at  xxxg447xxx (ser388tyr, thr389pro) receptors.  xxxd2306xxx  inhibited the activities of choline and methylcarbachol. muscarinic antagonists displayed small reductions in binding affinities, although muscarinic agonists showed greatly increased binding affinities for  xxxg447xxx (ser388tyr, thr389pro) receptors. all agonists, including choline and methylcarbachol, showed multiple affinity states at  xxxg447xxx (ser388tyr, thr389pro) receptors in the absence of gppnhp. the high affinity binding sites for acetylcholine,  xxxd215xxx  and choline were shifted in the presence of gppnhp. these results suggest that  xxxg447xxx (ser388tyr, thr389pro) is conformationally favorable for agonist binding and receptor activation.
