a series of 4h-1,2,4-pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides and 2,3-dihydro-4h-1,2,4-pyridothiadiazine
1,1-dioxides bearing various alkyl and aryl substituents on the 2-, 3-, and 4-positions was
synthesized and tested as possible positive allosteric modulators of the (r/s)-2-amino-3-(3hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) xxxd3029xxx  (ampa) receptors. many compounds were found
to be more potent than the reference compounds  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd181xxx  as potentiators of
the ampa current in rat cortex mrna-injected xenopus oocytes. the most active compound,
4-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (31b), revealed an in vitro
activity on xenopus oocytes not far from that of  xxxd1783xxx , the most potent allosteric
modulator of ampa receptors reported to date. moreover, 31b, but not  xxxd1783xxx , was found
to potentiate the duration and the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic field potentials
induced by electric stimulation in rat hippocampal slices. such an effect could indicate, for
31b, but not for  xxxd1783xxx , a possible interaction with postsynaptic  xxxg981xxx  binding
sites located on hippocampal ca1 neurons. structure-activity relationships indicated that
the structural requirements responsible for a biological activity on ampa receptors are different
from those responsible for an inhibitory activity on the insulin releasing process (putative atpsensitive k+-channel openers). for instance, 31b and other related dihydropyridothiadiazines
were found to be ineffective as inhibitors of insulin release from rat pancreatic b-cells, in
contrast to  xxxd1868xxx  and known pyridothiadiazines reported as atp-sensitive k+-channel
openers. conversely, the pyridothiadiazines active on b-cells were found to be ineffective as
potentiators of the ampa currents in xenopus oocytes. thus, 31b appeared to be more specific
than  xxxd1868xxx  as an  xxxg981xxx  modulator. this compound may be considered as a new
pharmacological tool, different from  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd1783xxx , for studying ampa receptors.
moreover, 31b can also constitute a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of cognitive
disorders.
introduction
during the last decade, the role of excitatory amino
acid (eaa) receptors in different neurological and
psychiatric disorders has been the subject of strong
research investigations. many works have been focused
on the design of eaa receptor-specific ligands or modulators as pharmacological tools and/or potential therapeutic agents.1,2

central eaa receptors can be subdivided into four
main classes: three ionotropic receptor subtypes (iglurs) (the n-methyl-d- xxxd233xxx  (nmda), the (r/s)2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) xxxd3029xxx 
(ampa), and the kainic acid receptors) and the fourth
subtype, the metabotropic eaa receptors (mglurs).1-5
whereas there is strong evidence supporting the view
that excessive excitation mediated by eaa receptors
may lead to neuronal damages, reduced function of such
receptors seems to play a role in schizophrenia as well
as in the learning and memory deficits observed in
alzheimer’s disease.1,6-8 ampa receptors are considered to be of major importance in such events described

for alzheimer’s disease.9,10 as a result, the potential
therapeutic effect of compounds able to activate ampa
receptors8 has encouraged the search in medicinal
chemistry for new  xxxg981xxx  modulators.
it has been recently demonstrated that, besides a
recognition site for glutamate, ampa receptors contain
additional binding sites of unknown physiological relevance.11 the cerebroprotective and anticonvulsant
drug 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy5h-2,3-benzodiazepine (gyki 52466) (1) (figure 1)
seems to act as a noncompetitive ampa antagonist
through an allosteric blocking mechanism on ampa
receptors.11
in contrast, other drugs have been shown to enhance
ampa/glutamate-induced neuronal excitation and to
facilitate  xxxg981xxx -mediated synaptic responses, without directly interacting with the ampa
agonist recognition site. these facilitators have been
proposed as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of learning and memory impairments, for instance,
in alzheimer’s disease. two benzothiadiazinedioxides,
 xxxd1783xxx  (2) and  xxxd1868xxx  (3), as well as the
nootropic drug  xxxd181xxx  (4) have been shown to
reduce  xxxg981xxx  desensitization. the latter effect
induces the enhancement of glutamate-activated inward
currents.12-17 the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on  xxxg981xxx 
currents was found to be clearly dissociated from its
ability to activate atp-sensitive potassium channels on
central neurons.17 recent studies have also shown that
 xxxd1783xxx  and 2,3-benzodiazepines like 1 act through
positive and negative allosteric modulation of the ampa
receptor, respectively. these drugs appear to interact
with two distinct binding sites on the same receptor.18-20
beside benzothiadiazinedioxides, arylamides such as
1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl) piperidine (ba-14) (5)

and 1-(quinoxalin-6-ylcarbonyl)piperidine (cx 516) (6)
were found to facilitate glutamate/ampa receptormediated synaptic responses.21-24 thus, 5 was expected
to promote the induction of long-term potentiation, a
form of synaptic plasticity that may be involved in the
encoding of memory.21,25-28
recently, a series of diuretic thiazides related to
 xxxd1783xxx  has also been found to reduce rapid
 xxxg981xxx  desensitization; in contrast to  xxxd3066xxx , a structurally related quinazolinone diuretic.29
this study suggested that a sulfonamide linkage in the
heterocyclic ring was required for activity on ampa
receptors. moreover, “saturated” thiazides (dihydrobenzothiadiazinedioxides) were found to be systematically
more active than their “unsaturated” counterparts (i.e.,
hydrochlorothiazide > chlorothiazide).29 among the
saturated thiazides,  xxxd1783xxx  was the most active
compound. these findings were confirmed by investigations on other  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd1783xxx  analogues.
the saturated analogue of  xxxd1868xxx , 7-chloro-3-methyl2,3-dihydro-4h-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (idra
21) (7), was found to be 3-4 times more potent than
 xxxd1868xxx  but less potent than  xxxd1783xxx  in potentiating the glutamate-activated inward current in ca1
pyramidal neurons.30 this effect on neurons was expected to result from the inhibition of  xxxg981xxx 
desensitization. compound 7 was further identified as
an orally active cognition-enhancing drug.31-33 it is
conceivable that drugs inhibiting the  xxxg981xxx 
desensitization could modify or improve impaired synaptic functions associated with learning and cognition
pathology.30
the present work examines three series of pyridothiadiazinedioxides (8-10) (figure 2) that are structurally related to the active benzothiadiazinedioxides as
possible allosteric modulators of the ampa receptors.
particular attention was paid to the influence of the
position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring as well
as to the nature and the size of the alkyl or aryl side
chains in the 2-, 3-, and 4-positions of the heterocycle.
structure-activity relationships were deduced from the
pharmacological evaluation of the drugs on an in vitro
model of ampa receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes
(rat cortex mrna-injected), as well as on rat hippocampal slices. moreover, the relationship between the
pharmacological effect and lipophilicity as determined
from the partition coefficient values obtained with
selected pyridothiadiazinedioxides in the 1-octanol/
buffer ph 7.4 aqueous solution system was discussed.

because  xxxd1868xxx  and recently synthesized pyridothiadiazinedioxides activate atp-sensitive potassium
channels (katp channels) and subsequently inhibit
insulin release from pancreatic b-cells,34-36 some dihydropyridothiadiazinedioxides structurally related to  xxxd1868xxx  were also evaluated in vitro as possible inhibitors of the insulin releasing process. even if the
inhibition of insulin release is not a definitive test for
identifying a new compound as a pancreatic b-cell katp
channel opener, a lack of activity on the secretory
process indicates that its pharmacological profile on
pancreatic b-cells is different from that of known
 xxxg1232xxx  openers.
finally, the structural requirements that were responsible for the orientation of the pharmacological
profile of the new pyridothiadiazine are discussed.

chemistry
the synthesis of 4h- xxxd3047xxx [2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine
1,1-dioxides (12) has been previously described.37 2,3dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides
(13) were obtained from ring closure of the appropriate
2-aminopyridine-3-sulfonamide (11) with paraformaldehyde or acetaldehyde in the presence of hydrochloric
acid as the catalyst (scheme 1).
4-chloropyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride (14), obtained as
previously described,34 gave access to 4-chloropyridine3-sulfonamide (15) and to n-substituted 4-chloropyridine-3-sulfonamides (18) after reaction with the appropriate alkyl/arylamine (scheme 2). by heating 15 with
selected alkylamines, the corresponding 4-alkylaminopyridine-3-sulfonamides (17) were obtained. under the
same conditions as previously described for 16,34 nsubstituted  xxxd1804xxx -3-sulfonamides (19) were
prepared from 18 (scheme 2).
4-(amino/alkylamino)pyridine-3-sulfonamides (16, 17)
and n-substituted  xxxd1804xxx -3-sulfonamides (19)
were used as starting materials in ring closure reactions
with appropriate anhydrides or aldehydes, giving rise
to the expected 4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1dioxides (20, 24) and 2,3-dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (21, 22, 26, 27) (schemes 3-5).
alkylation was observed in the 2-position of 4-alkyl-2,3dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides
(22) by heating the former with the appropriate alkyl
halide and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile (scheme

an alternative pathway was also used for the synthesis of some 2-alkyl/cycloalkyl-2,3-dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (26) (scheme 5).
fusion of the isopropoxymethylamino intermediates (25)
isolated after reaction of 19 with paraformaldehyde in
2- xxxd3026xxx  gave access by ring closure to the expected
2-substituted 2,3-dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (26).
the synthesis of 4h- xxxd3047xxx [3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine
1,1-dioxides (29, 30) and 2,3-dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [3,2-e]1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (31-34) is illustrated in
scheme 6. 3-aminopyridine-2-sulfonamide (28)38 was
reacted with orthoesters to give the unsaturated compounds (29).37 4h- xxxd3047xxx [3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1dioxide (29a) was converted by alkylation to the 4-substituted derivatives (30). the former compounds were
converted to their saturated counterparts (31) by reducing them with sodium borohydride in 2- xxxd3026xxx . 2,3dihydro-4h- xxxd3047xxx [3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides

were always more potent than their corresponding 5-aza
compounds (see for example 13c-21b-33b and 13b22a-31a, tables 1-4).
regarding the nature of the substituent in the 2-position, it appeared that only small groups such as h or
ch3 are acceptable with h as the preferred substituent
(compare 22a, 23a, and 23b, table 3; compare 31a and
32a, table 4; compare 31b, 32b, and 32c, table 4).
the nature of the substituent in the 3-position was
also found to have a critical influence. the preferred
substituents appeared to be h or ch3. more bulky
groups gave rise to a rapid loss of activity (see 21a to
21h, table 2; see 22a-22h-22i, table 3).
the last structural consideration refers to the nature
of the substituent in the 4-position. from biological
results obtained with the 7-aza compounds 21a and 22a
to 22h, it clearly appeared that the preferred alkyl
chains were ch3, ch2ch3, and ch(ch3)2 (tables 2 and
3). by increasing the size of the chain in this position,
a loss of activity on ampa currents was observed. the
same observation was made in the 8-aza family with
compounds 33a, 31a, 31b, and 31c (table 4). it was
noted that the ethyl side chain was optimal for in vitro
activity on ampa receptors.
previous investigations indicated that 4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides bearing an aminoalkyl
side chain in the 3-position (7-aza unsaturated compounds) were strong inhibitors of insulin release, like
 xxxd1868xxx . this inhibitory effect was dependent on their
capacity to activate the katp channels of pancreatic
b-cells.34,36 a few examples of such compounds [i.e.,
3-amino- (35a), 3-propylamino- (35b), 3-(2-butylamino)(35c), and 3-(1,2-dimethylpropylamino)-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (35d)] were tested on
ampa receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes. among
these 7-aza compounds, 35d is known as the most

potent drug on b-cells reported to date.34,36 none of
these drugs showed any activity as potentiators of the
ampa current (see table 5).
conversely, two 7-aza compounds (22a and 22b) and
one 8-aza compound (31b) showing strong activity on
ampa receptors were examined as possible inhibitors
of the insulin releasing process.34 no inhibitory activity
was observed at a 50 µm concentration. by contrast,
 xxxd1868xxx  and 7-aza compounds such as 3-alkylamino4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (35b-d)
decreased insulin release (table 5). a lack of activity
on insulin output indirectly suggests that such compounds do not act as  xxxg1253xxx  openers in pancreatic
b-cells.
taken as a whole, these results reveal that distinct
structural requirements in the 7-aza family conduct
either to inhibitors of insulin release (putative katp
channel activators) or to  xxxg981xxx  modulators.
an interesting information was further deduced from
the measurements on b-cells with the three pyridinic
analogues of  xxxd1868xxx , 12b, 20b, and 29b, as well as
with their saturated counterparts, 13c, 21b, and 33b.
as shown in table 5, neither the unsaturated compounds (12b, 20b, and 29b) nor the saturated ones (13c,
21b, and 33b) were found to exert a strong activity on
rat pancreatic islets as inhibitors of the insulin releasing
process. such a result strongly suggests that the
presence of an aminoalkyl side chain in the 3-position
of the unsaturated heterocycle may constitute a critical
structural requirement for activity on b-cells.
moreover, selected pyridothiadiazines have been tested
versus  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd181xxx  as potentiators of the
duration and the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (epsfp) induced by electric stimulation in rat hippocampal slices. table 6 reports the

it was observed that the compounds found to be more

active on rat hippocampal slices. the two most active
pyridothiadiazines on xenopus oocytes (31a and 31b)
appeared to be the most powerful drugs in the hippocampal model. surprisingly,  xxxd1783xxx  was found
to be inactive as a potentiator of the epsfp. it could
be postulated that  xxxd1783xxx , in contrast to the
selected pyridothiadiazines, is unable to modulate ampa
receptors located on the postsynaptic hippocampal ca1

neurons. these results are compatible with the putative
existence of more than one isoform of ampa receptors.
the two most active compounds, 31a and 31b, as well
as  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd181xxx  were tested in vivo on
dba/2 mice in order to observe the facilitation of the
cerebral excitation induced by an auditory stress and,
as a result, to verify their possible distribution into the
cns. dba/2 mice are sensitive to a high-intensity
sound wave inducing excitatory symptoms and convulsions. compounds able to facilitate the glutamatergic
neurotransmission may potentiate those symptoms. it
was found that  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd181xxx  were inactive
whereas a dose of 3 mg/kg ip of compound 31a and 1
mg/kg ip of compound 31b was able to double the
excitatory score.
because the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance may sometimes have a critical importance for compounds expected
to reach the cns, we investigated the influence of the
nitrogen atom position in the pyridine ring as well as
the influence of the saturation of the n(2)-c(3) double
bond on the lipophilic character of pyridothiadiazines.
table 7 reports the logarithmic value of the partition
coefficient between n-octanol and a buffer ph 7.4
aqueous solution (log p′ value) of selected pyridothiadiazines and dihydropyridothiadiazines from the three
families of drugs. the unsaturated compounds 12b,
20b, and 29b correspond to structural analogues of
 xxxd1868xxx  whereas the saturated 13c, 21b, and 33b
correspond to the pyridothiadiazines 12b, 20b, and 29b
after saturation of the 2,3 double bond.
we observed that the three families of drug did not
exhibit the same lipophilicity, the rank order from the
most to the less lipophilic being 5-aza > 7-aza > 8-aza
for the saturated as well as for the nonsaturated drugs.
saturated compounds exhibited a log p′ value 0.5 to 0.7
unit higher than their corresponding unsaturated counterparts.
it should be noted that the most active pyridothiadiazines ampa modulators belong to the 8-aza family of
drugs including the less lipophilic compounds. the most
potent pyridothiadiazine, compound 31b, was found to
exhibit a log p′ value of +0.12 which is far from the
recommended log p′ value of 1.5-2.0 for cns distribution. from the in vivo experiments on dba/2 mice,
which indicated a central effect of the molecule after ip
injection, it is tempting to speculate that the compound
was able to cross the blood-brain barrier. however,

the present work explored a large variety of pyridothiadiazines and dihydropyridothiadiazines bearing
various alkyl and aryl substituents on the 2-, 3-, and/or
4-positions of the heterocycle as possible allosteric
modulators of the ampa receptors (“ampakines”). many
drugs have been found to be more potent than the
reference compound  xxxd1868xxx  as potentiators of the
ampa current.
structure-activity relationships showed a clear dissociation between the structural requirements responsible for activity on the insulin releasing process (putative  xxxg1253xxx  openers) and those for activity on
the ampa receptors.
indeed, the saturated compounds (2,3-dihydro-4h1,2,4-pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides) were always more
active as ampa modulators than their corresponding
unsaturated drugs with a double bond between the 2and 3-positions (4h-1,2,4-pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides). the presence of such a 2-3 double bond, however,
is required for activity on pancreatic b-cell katp channels.
moreover, substituents at the 2- and 3-position of the
thiadiazine ring of potent ampa modulators were
preferably a hydrogen atom or a very short alkyl chain
such as a methyl group. the presence of a heteroatom
such as nitrogen in the 3-position completely suppressed
activity on ampa receptors. in contrast, for katp
channel openers, it has previously been shown that the
activity increased with the enhancement of the size and
the branching of the alkyl chain in the 3-position up to
a limit of steric hindrance.34 when the alkyl chain was
replaced with an aminoalkyl chain, thus introducing a
heteroatom in the 3-position, the efficiency as a  xxxg1232xxx  opener usually increased.36
finally, the biological activity of pyridothiadiazinetype ampa potentiators substituted in the 4-position
with a short alkyl chain (i.e., ethyl) was always more
pronounced than that of homologues bearing a hydrogen
atom in such a position. in contrast, pyridothiadiazines
identified as pancreatic b-cell  xxxg1232xxx  openers must be free of substituents in the 4-position. the
presence of an alkyl chain (i.e., methyl) in the 4-position
completely suppressed agonistic activity on the channel.36
from the drugs investigated as  xxxg981xxx 
potentiators, one compound, 4-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-4hpyrido[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (31b), revealed strong biological efficiency both in vitro and in
vivo. this compound was devoid of activity on pancreatic b-cells as inhibitor of the insulin releasing process,
thus being more specific than  xxxd1868xxx  as an ampa
receptor modulator. in contrast to  xxxd1783xxx , 31b
was also able to potentiate the duration and the
amplitude of epsfps induced by electric stimulation
on rat hippocampal slices. as a result, this drug
constitutes an important pharmacological tool, different

from  xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd1783xxx , for further investigations of ampa receptors. moreover, due to the importance of the glutamatergic receptors (i.e., ampa receptors) in cognitive functions and considering the decrease
in the number and sensitivity of such receptors during
cerebral senescence or neurodegenerative diseases,
compounds such as 31b could constitute possible candidates as new therapeutic agents for the treatment of
cognitive deficits associated to age, schizophrenia, and/
or alzheimer’s disease.

biological assays. potentiation of the excitatory
current induced by ampa on rat cortex mrnainjected xenopus oocytes. mrna were prepared from the
cerebral cortex of male wistar rats (80-100 g) according to
the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform single-step
method.40 poly(a)+ mrna was isolated using oligo-dt cellulose chromatography and injected in xenopus oocytes (50 ng/
oocyte). expression of the receptors was accomplished after
incubating the oocytes for 2 or 3 days at 18 °c. they were
then stored at 8-10 °c until their utilization. the electrophysiological recordings were performed in a plexiglass bath
at 20-24 °c in a or2 medium41 according a 2-electrode voltage
clamp with a third electrode placed in the bath as voltage
reference. stock solutions of the compounds were prepared
in dmso (100-300 mm), stored at -20 °c and diluted just
prior to use. the compounds were bath-applied at different
concentrations, and inward current responses were measured
at the end of the application period. ampa was used at a 30
µm concentration. the concentration of drug responsible for
a 2-fold (ec2x) or 5-fold (ec5x) increase in the amplitude of
the current induced by ampa (50-100 na) was calculated for
each compound. each experiment was accomplished at least
in triplicate.
inhibition of the insulin-releasing process on pancreatic b-cells. the method used for estimating the inhibitory activity of 4-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-4h-pyridothiadiazine 1,1dioxides on the insulin releasing process was the same as that
previously described for 3-alkylamino-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (ref 34). the compounds were tested
at a 50 µm concentration, and results were expressed as the
mean of 7-23 individual measurements.
study of the synaptic excitatory potentials induced
by electric stimulation on hippocampal slices. transverse hippocampal slices (500 µm) from male wistar rats (150250 g) were prepared as previously described42 and incubated
during 45 min in a calcium-free medium containing 10 mm
mg2+. they were then stabilized in a krebs medium adjusted
to ph 7.35 and supplemented with o2/co2 (95%/5%) at room
temperature. the slices were immersed at 35 °c and the
excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (epsfps) were recorded in the dendritic field of granule cells of the dentate
gyrus using nacl (3 m)-filled glass electrodes. the perforant
pathway was activated by single electrical stimuli (50-100 µa,
50 µs) applied every 30 s with a bipolar tungsten electrode.
data acquisition was performed using an a-d converter
(labmaster dma, scientific solutions) and interface (tl-1,
axon instruments) and a microcomputer equipped with an
appropriate software package (pclamp, axon instruments).
postsynaptic field potential amplitude and duration were
evaluated by measurement of the peak voltage of the negative
wave with respect to the baseline voltage. the compounds at
different concentrations were bath-applied for periods of 10-

20 min in a superfusion bath containing 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx  in order
to block nmda receptors activation. for each compound, the
concentration responsible for an 50% increase of the amplitude
(a50) or the duration (d50) of the epsfp was determined
(average of three consecutive records).
study of the facilitation of the cerebral excitation
induced by an auditory stress in dba/2 mice. 21-26
day-old dba/2 mice (iffa-credo, l’arbresle, france) submitted
in an isolated room to a high-intensity auditory stress (1400
hz, 103db) express excitatory symptoms and convulsions.
those behavioral consequences are antagonized by compounds
blocking the glutamatergic neurotransmission. when applied
at a higher frequency (1800 hz, 100 db), the auditory stress
does not provoke, or provokes to a lower extent, the excitatory
symptoms. compounds able to facilitate the glutamatergic
neurotransmission may be responsible for a potentialization
of those symptoms. a score from 1 to 4 is defined according
to the intensity of the symptoms observed with each animal.
groups of dba/2 mice (n ) 10) receive the tested compounds
by intraperitoneal injection 30 min before submission to the
auditory stress. a control group (n ) 10) receives the solvent.
the dose of compound responsible for a 2-fold increase of the
excitatory score compared to the control score was measured.
partition coefficient determinations. the partition
coefficients in 1-octanol/phosphate buffer (ph 7.40) of the
compounds were determined by the shake-flask technique as
previously described37 using 1 × 10-4 m stock solutions of
drugs in 1-octanol or in the buffer. drug concentration after
partition was determined by uv spectrophotometry at the
maximum absorbance.
