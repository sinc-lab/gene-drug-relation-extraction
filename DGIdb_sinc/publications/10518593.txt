the pharmacological phenotype of atp-sensitive potassium (katp)
channels is defined by their tissue-specific regulatory subunit, the
sulfonylurea receptor (sur), which associates with the pore-forming channel core,  xxxg1250xxx . the  xxxg1232xxx  opener  xxxd1868xxx 
has hyperglycemic and hypotensive properties that stem from its
ability to open katp channels in pancreas and smooth muscle.
 xxxd1868xxx  is believed not to have any significant action on cardiac
sarcolemmal katp channels. yet,  xxxd1868xxx  can be cardioprotective
in ischemia and has been found to bind to the presumed cardiac
sarcolemmal  xxxg1253xxx -regulatory subunit, sur2a. here, in
excised patches,  xxxd1868xxx  (300 ␮m) activated pancreatic sur1兾
 xxxg1250xxx  currents and had little effect on native or recombinant
cardiac sur2a兾kir6.2 currents. however, in the presence of cytoplasmic adp (100 ␮m), sur2a兾kir6.2 channels became as sensitive
to  xxxd1868xxx  as sur1兾kir6.2 channels. this effect involved specific
interactions between mgadp and sur, as it required mg2ⴙ, but not
atp, and was abolished by point mutations in the second nucleotide-binding domain of sur, which impaired channel activation
by mgadp. at the whole-cell level, in cardiomyocytes treated with
oligomycin to block mitochondrial function,  xxxd1868xxx  could also
activate katp currents only after cytosolic adp had been raised by
a creatine kinase inhibitor. thus, adp serves as a cofactor to define
the responsiveness of cardiac katp channels toward  xxxd1868xxx . the
present demonstration of a pharmacological plasticity of katp
channels identifies a mechanism for the control of channel activity
in cardiac cells depending on the cellular adp levels, which are
elevated under ischemia.

t

he  xxxg1232xxx -opening drug (kco)  xxxd1868xxx  has
been in clinical use for the treatment of persistent hyperinsulinemia and hypertensive emergencies (1). its pharmacodynamic properties have been related to the opening of atpsensitive potassium (katp) channels present in pancreatic ␤-cells
and smooth muscle, where these channels regulate insulin secretion and vascular tone (2, 3). plasma membrane katp channels are constituted of an inward rectifier k⫹ channel,  xxxg1250xxx ,
associated with a regulatory subunit, the sulfonylurea receptor
(sur) (4–6). sur, a member of the atp-binding-cassette
(abc) transporter family, is the primary target of the kcos
(7–9). it is now established that the nucleotide-binding domains
of sur are tightly linked to the sites of action of kcos because
binding and effects of kcos require hydrolyzable nucleotides
and are compromised by mutations that, in other abc transporters, impair the ability of these domains to bind and hydrolyze
nucleotides (8–11). several isoforms of sur have been identified, including  xxxg19xxx  in pancreatic ␤-cells (4, 5) and sur2b in
smooth muscle (12).
in addition to its hyperglycemic and hypotensive properties,
 xxxd1868xxx  also has the ability to protect ischemic myocardial
tissue (13), which expresses sur2a, the presumed cardiac
isoform of sur (14). however, it has been difficult to demonstrate any stimulatory effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on plasmalemmal
cardiac katp channels, either in their native form (15) or after

reconstitution by heterologous coexpression of  xxxg1250xxx  and
sur2a (14, 16, 17). it has, therefore, become an established
dogma that  xxxd1868xxx  does not act on cardiac sarcolemmal katp
channels (18–20). this has given weight to the hypothesis that
 xxxd1868xxx  could produce some of its cardioprotective effects
through activation of mitochondrial, rather than plasmalemmal,
katp channels (13, 21).
binding experiments, however, have demonstrated that  xxxd1868xxx  can interact not only with  xxxg19xxx , but also with sur2a
itself (8). moreover, some reports have described a diazoxideinduced shortening of the cardiac action potential and兾or an
increase in whole-cell currents (13, 22, 23), suggesting that
conditions exist where  xxxd1868xxx  could activate cardiac kir6.2兾
sur2a channels, much like pancreatic kir6.2兾sur1 channels.
here, we report that increase in cytoplasmic mgadp is the
condition required for  xxxd1868xxx  to activate cardiac katp channels, both native and recombinant. this implies that the transduction steps linking opener binding and channel opening are
regulated by nucleotide interaction with the nucleotide-binding
domains not only in the  xxxg19xxx  protein (10, 11), but also in
sur2a. as the ischemic myocardium is characterized by increased levels of cytosolic adp, an adp-dependent activation
of cardiac katp channels by  xxxd1868xxx  could be relevant to its
overall cardioprotective action.

activation of sur2a兾kir6.2 by  xxxd1868xxx  in the presence of adp.

within 3 days after injection of xenopus oocytes with crnas
coding for  xxxg1250xxx  and either  xxxg19xxx  or sur2a, macroscopic
katp currents could be recorded in excised inside-out patches.
 xxxg19xxx  and sur2a兾kir6.2 channels exhibited similar sensitivities to inhibition by intracellular atp, with 10–20 ␮m atp
causing half-inhibition on average (9).
when currents were blocked to about 15% of their maximal
values by 100 ␮m atp,  xxxd1868xxx  (300 ␮m) caused a 5-fold
increase in sur1兾kir6.2 currents but had little effects on

100 ␮m adp,  xxxd1868xxx  caused a robust increase in current,
regardless of whether  xxxg19xxx  or sur2a was expressed. at 100
␮m, adp produced a 3-fold stimulation of atp-inhibited  xxxg19xxx 
or sur2a兾kir6.2 currents. on top of this stimulation,  xxxd1868xxx 
further activated currents more than 3-fold (3.8 ⫾ 0.4 for  xxxg19xxx 
and 3.6 ⫾ 0.7 for sur2a). therefore, adp uncovers a previously unrecognized ability of sur2a兾kir6.2 channels to respond to  xxxd1868xxx .

selected oocytes were injected the next day with 50 nl of water
containing ⬇2 ng of  xxxg1250xxx  crna and with ⬇6 ng of crna
encoding  xxxg19xxx  or sur2a. they were stored at 19°c in a

and heterologously expressed katp channels were characterized
by the patch-clamp technique in the excised inside-out configuration (25) by using techniques similar to those we used to
record native frog skeletal muscle katp channels (26, 27).
conditions were designed to optimize recording of katp
currents and minimize contributions by endogenous oocyte cl⫺
currents. patch pipettes (2–10 m⍀) contained (in mm) 154 k⫹,

remaining anions. except where noted, mg2⫹ was 1 mm. the
membrane potential was maintained at ⫺50 mv.
cardiac myocytes. guinea pig ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as described (28). for inside-out
patch–clamp recordings, fire-polished pipettes (5–7 m⍀) contained (in mm): 140 kcl, 1 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 5 hepes-koh (ph

on-line on a high-gain digital storage oscilloscope (vc-6025;

average data for sur1兾kir6.2 (left) and sur2a兾kir6.2 (right) were obtained
from three patches each by using the protocols of a and b.

channels (fig. 2 a),  xxxd1868xxx -induced activity is already vigorous in the absence of added adp and is enhanced progressively
by further addition of 10 and 100 ␮m adp. for both channel
isoforms, the sensitivity to adp alone appeared equivalent, with
slight activation  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m and large activation at 100 ␮m
(fig. 2c).
the experiments described in figs. 1 and 2 were performed
with both atp and mg2⫹ present. in the absence of atp and
presence of mg2⫹ (1 mm), when the concentration of adp was
raised to 1 mm, which partially blocked katp current,  xxxd1868xxx 
(300 ␮m) activated sur2a兾kir6.2 currents to the maximum
level observed in the absence of nucleotides (fig. 3a; fold
increase ⫽ 2.03 ⫾ 0.4; n ⫽ 5). after removal of mg2⫹ and in the
presence of edta,  xxxd1868xxx  could not increase channel activity
despite the presence of 1 mm adp (fig. 3b), suggesting that
mgadp, rather than adp alone, is required for opener-induced
activation of sur2a兾kir6.2 channels.
mutations in the second nbd of sur2a eliminate adp and
 xxxd1868xxx  activation. atp-binding-cassette transporters contain

two cytoplasmic nbds, nbd1 and nbd2, with walker a and b

motifs forming an atp-binding pocket (29). the highly conserved walker a lysine and walker b aspartate are important
for atp binding and兾or hydrolysis, as the lysine residue interacts
with the ␤-phosphate of atp, whereas the aspartate residue
coordinates with a mg2⫹ ion to interact with the ␤- and
␥-phosphates of atp (30). in  xxxg19xxx , mutations of these residues
in both nbds disrupt the channel response to adp and  xxxd1868xxx  (10, 11). mutations in nbd1 eliminate atp binding,
whereas equivalent mutations in nbd2 only impair the ability of
mgadp to antagonize atp binding (31), suggesting that the
nbd2 domain is responsible for the interaction between  xxxg19xxx 
and mgadp. the role of nbd2 in mgadp-dependent  xxxd1868xxx  action on sur2a兾kir6.2 channels was directly tested in
channels with mutated walker a lysine (k1348m) and walker
b aspartate (d1469n) residues. these two sur2a mutants,
when coexpressed with  xxxg1250xxx , produced functional channels
with a sensitivity to atp similar to that observed in the wild type
(fig. 4). however, these mutants produced channels with an
impaired sensitivity to mgadp (fig. 4), consistent with a critical
role for nbd2 in mediating the interaction of adp with sur2a.
in these mutants, the lack of sensitivity to adp was associated
with the inability of  xxxd1868xxx  to activate the channels alone or
in the presence of mgadp (fig. 4).
 xxxd1868xxx  activates native cardiac katp channels. sur2a is the
proposed cardiac isoform of sur (14–17), and the adp requirement for  xxxd1868xxx -induced channel activation should be
reproducible with the channel expressed in its native environment.  xxxd1868xxx  was therefore tested on katp channels in
membranes of ventricular myocytes. like sur2a兾kir6.2 channels, native cardiac katp channels were blocked by 300 ␮m atp
and activated by 100 ␮m adp (fig. 5a). in the presence of adp,
 xxxd1868xxx  (300 ␮m) produced significant increase in channel
activity, which was only marginal in the absence of adp. on
average, the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  in the absence of adp was
equivalent in native channels and recombinant sur2a兾kir6.2

channels (fold increases of 1.79 ⫾ 0.35, n ⫽ 8, and 1.51 ⫾ 0.14,
n ⫽ 20, respectively). such effect could be because of vehicle (see
fig. 1c) and兾or possible presence of contaminant adp in the
atp solutions. in the presence of adp,  xxxd1868xxx  in native
channels produced significant activation, albeit the relative
increase in native channel activity was smaller than that observed
in recombinant channels (fold increases of 2.15 ⫾ 0.52, n ⫽ 8, vs.
3.56 ⫾ 0.71, n ⫽ 14). this apparent difference in efficacy might
not reflect a real variance in the responsiveness of native vs.
recombinant channels. it could be because of saturation of the
effect of  xxxd1868xxx  in native channels operating, in the presence
of adp, at levels beyond which even more effective activators
could not produce a more pronounced channel activation.
in contrast to inside-out patches, in the intact cardiomyocytes,
katp channels are coupled to intracellular atp-consuming兾
atp-generating systems (32). under such conditions, the effid’hahan et al.

cacy of  xxxd1868xxx  will depend on the availability of adp at the
channel site. in cardiomyocytes treated with the mitochondrial
atp-synthase inhibitor oligomycin,  xxxd1868xxx  did not activate
 xxxg1253xxx  current (fig. 6). this suggests that, in addition to
mitochondrial adp consumption, other catalytic activities recycle adp into atp. this may include creatine kinase, which is
responsible for 90% of atp turnover in cardiac cells (33).
therefore, we added to oligomycin-treated cardiomyocytes the
creatine kinase inhibitor dnfb, which, on its own, induced
modest channel activation (fig. 6), suggesting that, with inhibited creatine kinase, levels of adp were raised. further application of  xxxd1868xxx  produced vigorous increase in outward
current, in line with a  xxxd1868xxx -induced activation of katp
current (fig. 6). the  xxxd1868xxx -induced outward current partially reversed on washout (fig. 6 a and b) and was observed at
both ⫹10 mv, where outward and inward current components
are not separated, and ⫺50 mv, where the inward current
component is essentially inactivated (fig. 6a). thus, after
inhibition of cellular adp-utilizing systems,  xxxd1868xxx  can enhance whole-cell katp current.
discussion
 xxxd1868xxx  has a special place among kcos, as it displays an
apparently high selectivity for pancreatic ␤-cell and smooth
muscle over cardiac katp channels. in isolated patches from
cardiac muscle cells or from cells expressing recombinant
sur2a兾kir6.2 channels, a stimulatory effect of  xxxd1868xxx  has
never been reported to date, leading to the consensus opinion
that cardiac sarcolemmal katp channels are insensitive to this
drug (18–21).

is shown (e). original current traces corresponding to numbered circles are

for 5 min to disrupt mitochondrial function and prevent effects of  xxxd1868xxx

present results demonstrate that  xxxd1868xxx  can produce activation of cardiac katp channels with adp serving as an essential
cofactor in this phenomenon. experimental evidence was obtained for both recombinant and native cardiac katp channels.
in the absence of adp,  xxxd1868xxx  caused only a slight activation
of cardiac katp channels, which could have been overlooked in
previous studies. this activation could have arisen from an effect
of the vehicle, in our case dmso, or from the presence of
contaminant adp, which cannot be avoided when solutions
containing atp are used. in the presence of 100 ␮m adp,
 xxxd1868xxx  produced a large activation comparable to that seen
with pancreatic kir6.2兾sur1 channels. the concentration
threshold for this effect of adp was between 10 and 100 ␮m.
this could explain the lack of clear effects of  xxxd1868xxx  on

tration of free adp is maintained below the micromolar range
by a number of adp-utilizing processes, including the creatine
kinase reaction (34). only after blocking adp consumption
could we observe a consistent increase in whole-cell katp
currents by  xxxd1868xxx . to ensure that  xxxd1868xxx  acted directly on
sarcolemmal channels and not indirectly via mitochondrial channels (13, 21, 35), in those experiments, cells were pretreated with
oligomycin to disrupt mitochondrial function. the evidence thus
shows that  xxxd1868xxx  will increase k⫹ currents in heart muscle
only in conditions of elevated adp levels as might occur under
ischemic conditions (35). this preference for sarcolemmal channels in metabolically compromised cells, combined with the
activation of mitochondrial channels (13, 21, 36), could contribute to the cardioprotective efficacy of  xxxd1868xxx .
in terms of molecular structure, the observed correlation
between native channels and sur2a兾kir6.2 supports the hypothesis that these two entities are identical (14, 16, 37).
experiments showing that  xxxd1868xxx  can displace the binding of
a radiolabeled opener from sur2a (8) imply that sur2a
possesses a  xxxd1868xxx  binding site like other known isoforms of
the sur do. as binding experiments (8) were done in the
absence of adp, it would appear that adp facilitates  xxxd1868xxx 
activation by acting on the coupling between  xxxd1868xxx  and
channel opening, rather than on the binding step. that mg2⫹ is
required, but atp is neither sufficient nor necessary to promote
 xxxd1868xxx  action suggests, first, that adp, produced through a
possible (though still undemonstrated) hydrolysis of atp by
sur, cannot replace exogenously supplied adp, and second,
that the mechanism involves the second nbd, nbd2, of
sur2a, which preferentially binds mgadp (31). corroborating
this latter conclusion, mutations of the conserved lysine (to
methionine) and aspartate (to asparagine) residues of the
walker a and b motifs of nbd2 abolished both adp and
 xxxd1868xxx  activation. in  xxxg19xxx , the corresponding lysine-tomethionine mutation cancelled the activatory effects of adp but
not of  xxxd1868xxx  (10), suggesting that an obligatory link between
adp and  xxxd1868xxx  exists in sur2a but not  xxxg19xxx .
in summary, we provide evidence for the critical role of
intracellular adp in defining the response of cardiac katp
channel toward  xxxd1868xxx . that cardiac katp channels can be
rendered  xxxd1868xxx -sensitive provides a mechanistic basis for the
action of this opener on cardiac sarcolemmal katp channels.
along with previous reports of nucleotide diphosphatedependent action of channel openers (10, 11, 38), as well as
blockers (29, 39–42), the present study demonstrates a fundamental role for adp in defining the pharmacological plasticity
