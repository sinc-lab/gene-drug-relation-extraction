the  xxxd301xxx  test for pancreatic exocrine
lnsufficiency
phillip p. toskes, m.d.
the  xxxd301xxx  test, a test of pancreatic exocrine function, has recently been approved for clinical
use by the food and drug administration. the test has been studied in adult patients with chronic
pancreatic disease and in children with cystic fibrosis. the 500-mg dose and 6-hour urine collection
period appear optimal for separating patients with chronic pancreatic disease from control subjects. side
effects with the 500-mg dose are virtually nonexistent. this simply performed outpatient test of chymotrypsin function appears to be an excellent means of confirming the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine
insufficiency.

attached to para-aminobenzoic acid (paba) by a
chymotrypsin-labile bond. in europe,  xxxd301xxx  is
administered in tablet or powder form. in this country, it is formulated as a solution containing 40%  xxxd3034xxx  and 21% sorbitol. the approved 500mg dose contains 170 mg of paba.  xxxd301xxx  is
practically insoluble in water, dilute acid and ether;
sparingly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in dilute alkali. the pka is 5.4.

preclinical safety studies and side effects

the  xxxd301xxx  test is a diagnostic test for chymotrypsin function. it depends upon the ability of the
subject to secrete normal amounts of chymotrypsin
by the exocrine pancreas.  xxxd301xxx , administered orally, is cleaved by chymotrypsin, and most of
the free paba is absorbed by the small intestine and
partially conjugated by the liver. metabolitesof paba
- arylamines - are excreted into the urine.

current clinical perspective of the  xxxd301xxx  test
future directions

 xxxd301xxx  ( xxxd301xxx ) is a diagnostic agent that
was recently approved by the food and drug administration for marketing by adria laboratories as a
confirmatorytest for the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. the concept of having a tracercontaining peptide that would be specificallycleaved
by one of the pancreatic enzymes was suggested by
norton greenberger approximately 15 years ago.
there has been extensive experiencewith this test in
europe and japan, where it has been administered
to over 7,000 patients. the  xxxd301xxx  test has become part of the routine classification scheme for
chronic pancreatic disease in japan.

metabolism
experimental animal studies using labeled  xxxd301xxx  have indicated that most of the drug is completely hydrolyzed, with urinary metabolites consisting of the n-acetyl and the glycine conjugates of
paba. high levels of unconjugatedbenzoic acid and
the presence of benzoyl-l-tyrosine in the urine indicate that the benzoyl-l-tyrosine moiety may be
absorbed intact.’ it is not known whether  xxxd301xxx 
or paba crosses the placenta or the blood-brain
barrier.

chemical properties

testing procedure

as shown in figure 1,  xxxd301xxx  (n-benzoyl-ltyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid) is a synthetic peptide

after an overnight fast, the subject ingests the oral
solution of  xxxd301xxx . immediately after dosing,
250 ml of water are given, then another 500 ml of
water two to six hours after dosing. urine is collected
for six hours after dosing. urinary arylamines are
measured by the smith modification of the brattonmarshall method.2
concurrent use of the following drugs may lead to
false elevation of urinary arylamines: acetamino-

phen,  xxxd2898xxx ,  xxxd305xxx , chloramphenicol, procaine, procainamide, sulfonamides, thiazides, and lidocaine. in addition, paba-containing
drugs such as sunscreens or certain multiple-vitamin
preparations may falsely elevate test results. foods
such as prunes and cranberries may also interfere
with the analysis for arylamines in the urine. such
agents should be discontinuedthree days prior to the
administration of  xxxd301xxx . in addition, any pancreatic enzyme supplements should be discontinued
at least three days and preferably seven days prior to
testing with  xxxd301xxx . results are unreliable in
patients with impaired renal function, that is, serum
creatinines of >2.0 mg/dl (>177 pmol/l). although it
is possible that severe liver disease or severe small
bowel disease could give a falsely low value, in
reality these clinical conditions are not hard to
differentiate.
in this country it is suggested that the test be performed in the fasted state. in europe, however,  xxxd301xxx  is often given with a test meal to stimulate
pancreatic secretion. in gyr’s extensive experience
with this test,3 he observed no difference in results
whether the  xxxd301xxx  was given in syrup or with a
defined breakfast. the test is advertised in switzerland as “breakfast instead of intubation.” there are
studies, however, that indicate that meals containing
complex starches or olive oil may decrease the excretion of  xxxd301xxx . thus although clinical experience suggests that the test may be acceptable
whether administered in the fasted state or with a
meal, it appears prudent that the exact composition
of the meal be known.
determination of appropriate dose and urinary
collection period
significant differences in paba excretion after the
oral administration of  xxxd301xxx  have been consistently found between healthy control subjects and
patients with chronic pancreatic disease, with doses
of  xxxd301xxx  ranging from 100 mg to 5 g. the extensive experience of japanese and european investigators has been with doses of 500 and 1000
rng, respectively.
the amount of chymotrypsin normally secreted by
the pancreas (100 mg/hr)4 is capable of digesting

toskes

75

several grams of bentiromideover a six-hour period.
for doses of bentiromideranging from 100 mg to 1 g,
healthy subjects excrete on the average 75% over a
six-hour period.se at doses of 2 g or greater, however, it appears that the excretion of paba may decrease.8 with the k, of  xxxd301xxx  being about 0.2
mm in the ph range of the proximal small
it
appears that after administration of less than 2 g,
concentrations of  xxxd301xxx  within the proximal intestine are in the range where its rate of digestion is
dose dependent. thus, as pointed out by imondi,1°
increasing the dose within this range increases the
velocity of the reaction and the absolute amount of
drug digested per unit time, but has no appreciable
effect on the percentage digested.
these observations suggest that 500 to 1,000 mg
should be the doses of choice. these are high
enough so that background urinary arylamine levels
are negligible, yet low enough so that the excretion of
paba is not a limiting factor.
clinical experience has indeed supported these
amounts as optimal. in a recent united states doserangingcrossover study of  xxxd301xxx  in 47 patients
with well-defined chronic pancreatic disease and 61
healthy volunteers, doses of 100 mg, 500 mg, 1 g,
and 5 g were evaluated.8 in addition, postdosing
urine collection periods of 0-3, 0-6, 0-1 2 and 0-24
hours were studied. the urinary arylamine excretion
data for the four doses and =-hour collection periods are shown in table l . for each of the doses
evaluated, there was a significant difference (p <
0.001) in cumulative arylamine excretion between
the healthy controls and those with chronic pancreatic disease. the 500-mg dose and six-hour urine collection period appeared optimal for separating patients from controls. with a cutoff point of 57% (mean
- 2 sd), there were 5% false positive and 20% false
negative results.
figure 2 is a normal distribution fit of the 500-mg
dose, six-hour urinary arylamine excretion for the 61
controls. the results are tightly grouped, with no control subject demonstrating a value of <50°/o.
figure 3 shows the relativefrequency distributions
of the six-hour recovery levels for the 500-mg dose
for both the 61 controls and 47 patients with chronic
pancreatic disease. as can be seen, there is some
overlap in the 50-75% arylamine recovery range.
the 5-9 amount was clearly unacceptable because of a high frequency of nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea. two percent of control subjects and 17% of
those with pancreatic disease had similar side effects with 1-g. the 100-mg dose, although free of
side effects, led to technical problems with the assay. postdosing arylarnine recovery rates after 100
mg were too close to baseline arylamine levels to
provide reliable results.
clinical experience
the  xxxd301xxx  test has been shown to be reliable in diagnosing pancreatic exocrine insufficiency
in both adults and in children with cystic fibrosis.

after the demonstration in 1972 by lmondi and
associates that the  xxxd301xxx  test could reflect
pancreatic exocrine impairment in animals with experimentally induced pancreatic exocrine insufficiency,ll reports of the test's utility in patients began to
appear in 1976 from the united states, europe and
12,,l3
ja~an.~
~ .initial studies were performed in patients with severe pancreatic disease and demonstrated excellent correlation with standard tests of
pancreatic exocrine function, such as the secretin or
the lundh test. collective experience indicated that
the sensitivity in these early studies was about 85%.
a multicenter united states study evaluated patients with chronic pancreatic disease of varied severity, using the secretin-cck test as the objective
measure of pancreatic exocrine function.14 this
study clearly demonstrated that mild impairment of
exocrine function as shown by the secretin-cck intubation test was not consistently detected by the
 xxxd301xxx  test. severe impairment of exocrine
function, that is, diarrhea, steatorrhea or weight loss,
were reliably detected by the  xxxd301xxx  test with a
sensitivity of 8&90%, as previously suggested.
lange et al reported their extensive experience
with this test in 588 patients over a five-year period.15
in their hands the sensitivity of the test was 86%.
these same investigators summarizedthe collective
european experience with  xxxd301xxx  in 1495 patients, and found that the sensitivity ranged in seven
separate studies from 82 to 100%.
in the dose-ranging study by toskes of 47 patients
with well-defined chronic pancreatic disease,8 the
sensitivity of the  xxxd301xxx  test appeared to be
between that of pancreatic calcification on plain film
of the abdomen and the manifestation of steatorrhea; that is, the test became abnormal when there
was >8o% but <90% damage to the exocrine pancreas.
in the toskes study, as in all others, there appeared to be some patients with severe pancreatic
disease who maintained a normal  xxxd301xxx  test
(figure 3).the explanation for these false negative
results occurring in 20% of patients is not clear. it has

been suggested that variations in duodenal ph in
patients with pancreatic disease may be partly re~ponsible.~
other studies, however, have failed to
show a relationship between intestinal ph and the
results obtained with the  xxxd301xxx  test.l6.l7
another factor to be considered with false negative
results may be related to when the patient's pancreatic extract was stopped prior to testing with  xxxd301xxx . in many studies, pancreatic extract was
stopped for just 24 hours prior to administration of
 xxxd301xxx . recent evidence indicates that in some
patients with pancreatic disease who have been
maintained on pancreatic extract for several months,
there may be a carryover effect on the absorption of
both  xxxd301xxx  and cobalamin (vitamin b12)for up
to seven days after cessation of pancreatic extract
administration.18 the explanation for this rather remarkable observation remains to be determined. in
addition, there is some evidence that there may be
an enzyme in the small bowel that can cleave  xxxd301xxx , such that a patient with severely impaired
pancreatic function would excrete normal levels of
urinary arylamines after  xxxd301xxx  administration.lgthe importance of this intestinal protease has
yet to be defined. recent studies in the rat indicate
that intestinal proteases account for very little metabolism of  xxxd301xxx .20finally, an occasional patient
with chronic pancreatic disease may have concomitant bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine.21in
vitro studies have indicatedthat some intestinal bacteria have the capability of metabolizing bentirothus it is possible that a patient with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and marked bacterial
overgrowth could theoretically have a normal  xxxd301xxx  test due to the digestion of  xxxd301xxx  by the
bacteria. clinical experience to date has not indicated that overgrowth of bacteria within the small intestine significantly influences  xxxd301xxx  test results
in humans.
with respect to specificity of an abnormal  xxxd301xxx  test, that is, how often the test will be abnormal
in other disease states, there is some controversy.

sin, paba must be absorbed through the small intestine and partially conjugated by the liver. theoretically, tests in patients with small bowel or liver disease
could produce false positive results, for example,
decreased urinary arylamine excretion after oral administration of  xxxd301xxx , without pancreatic disease being present.
with respect to liver disease, this does not appear
to be a relevant clinical pr0b1em.l~although further
studies with  xxxd301xxx  should be performed in patients with liver disease of varied severity, it seems
that significant impairment of paba conjugation
does not appear until severe, obvious liver disease is
present. such patients would be obviously jaundiced
and not likely to be administered  xxxd301xxx . when
false positive results have been noted in patients
with liver disease, the dose of  xxxd301xxx  employed
was high - 2 g.7.23this problem has not been observed with the suggested lower doses.15
patients with severe small bowel disease may
have symptoms similar to those of patients with pancreatic insufficiency - diarrhea, steatorrhea or
weight loss - that could pose a clinical problem.
again, in actuality this does not appear to be a problem with doses of  xxxd301xxx  of 500 mg to 1 g. small
bowel disease in patients who might demonstrate an
abnormal bentiromidetest in the face of normal pancreatic function can be detected with simple tests
such as a urinary 25-9 xylose test or small bowel xrays, which are easy to perform. figure 4 demonstrates a suggested algorithm using the  xxxd301xxx 
and urinary xylose tests in patients with symptomatic
diarrhea, steatorrhea or weight loss. it is probable
that with either of these two simple outpatient tests,
the correct cause of the symptoms could be ascertained in 85% of patients.

cystic fibrosis who are 6 years of age or older. more
experience is needed with younger patients. the
 xxxd301xxx  test has also been used successfully to
titrate the amount of pancreatic extract needed in
patients with cystic fibrosis.

preclinical safety studies and side effects
in rodents, the oral ld, of  xxxd301xxx  and its
metabolites is greater than 4 g/kg. dosages of up to
2,000 mg/kg daily for 30 days were well tolerated in
rats. dogs given  xxxd301xxx  orally in dosages up to
400 mg/kg per day for 30 days also manifested no
signs of toxicity (adria laboratories, inc., columbus,
ohio 43216).
the recommended 500-mg dose has caused virtually no side effects. similarly, the extensive european experience with 1 g indicates that side effects
with that dose are rare. the dose-ranging united
states study found diarrhea to be a side effect in 2%
of control subjects and 17% of patients with pancreatic diseae who had been administered 1 g. the
difference between the european and american
experience with that amount is probably related to
the method of formulation. other uncommon side
effects have been nausea, headache and respiratory
distress in one patient (thought to be an allergic
response).

current clinical perspective of the  xxxd301xxx 
test
the extensive worldwide experience with bentiro-

mide suggests that it is a simple, reliable confirmatory test for the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. in contrast to a screening test that should
have high sensitivity and few false negative results, a
confirmatory test should have high specificity and
few false positive results. thus a negative result with
the bentiromidetest does not rule out the disease. a
positive test, however, strongly suggests pancreatic
exocrine insufficiency. although not as sensitive as
the awkward direct tube tests, the bentiromidetest is
excellent to document pancreatic exocrine insufficiency as the cause of a patient’s diarrhea, steatorrhea or weight loss. its simplicity makes it very attractive. in those situations where it appears prudent to
exclude small bowel disease as a cause of diarrhea,
steatorrhea or weight loss, another simple outpatient
test - the 25-9 urinary xylose test - is of considerable help. results are usually normal in patients with
steatorrhea secondary to pancreatic disease and invariably abnormal in those with steatorrhea secondary to small bowel disease. the  xxxd301xxx  test
will usually be abnormal in patients with steatorrhea
secondary to pancreatic disease and occasionally
abnormal in small bowel steatorrhea. use of both of
these simple outpatient tests will provide the clinician
with the cause of any of these three symptoms in
about 8045% of patients. of course, impairment in
renal function will affect both the urinary xylose and
 xxxd301xxx  tests. as suggested in figure 4, more
extensive evaluation may be needed in the 15-20%
of patients whose symptomatic diarrhea or steatorrhea is not explained by either test. the  xxxd301xxx
