can cox-2 inhibitor-induced increase in cardiovascular disease risk be modified by essential  xxxd2154xxx ?  selective cox-2 inhibitors increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. this has been attributed to their ability to inhibit endothelial cox-2 derived prostacyclin (pgi2) but not platelet cox-1 derived thromboxane a2 (txa2). on the other hand, aspirin blocks both cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes without decreasing pgi2 but blocks txa2 synthesis that explains its beneficial action in the prevention of coronary heart disease (chd). the inhibitory action of aspirin on cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes enhances the tissue concentrations of dihomo-gamma- xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1886xxx ),  xxxd208xxx ,  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), and docosahexaenoic acid (dha). these  xxxd2154xxx  form precursors to  xxxd124xxx , pgi2, pgi3, lipoxins (lxs), and resolvins that have anti-inflammatory actions. in contrast, increase in the concentrations of  xxxd1886xxx , aa, epa, and dha is much less with specific cox-2 inhibitors since they do not block the formation of eicosanoids through cox-1 pathway. cox-2 inhibitors interfere with the formation of lxs and resolvins that have neuroprotective and cardioprotective actions. epa and pgi2 have anti-arrhythmic action. epa, dha, and aa augment eno formation that prevents atherosclerosis. this suggests that cox-2 inhibitors increase cardiovascular and stroke risk by interfering with the formation of eno, pgi2, lxs, and resolvins and implies that combining efas with cox-2 inhibitors could prevent these complications.
