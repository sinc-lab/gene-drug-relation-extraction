abstract. interrupting the renin-angiotensin system (ras) with
a usual daily dose of a single-site ras inhibitor does not
achieve complete and long-lasting pharmacologic blockade.
hormonal and bp effects were compared for 48 h after administration of single oral doses of 300 mg (high dose) of the renin
inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  (a300) and 160 mg (standard antihypertensive dose) of the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist  xxxd3487xxx  (v160) and
their combination each at half dose (a150⫹v80) in 12 mildly
sodium-depleted normotensive individuals. in this doubleblind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four-period crossover
study, a300 decreased plasma renin activity and  xxxg99xxx 
and ii levels for 48 h, stimulated immunoreactive active renin
release more strongly than v160, and decreased urinary aldosterone excretion for a longer duration than v160. in contrast
to v160, the a150⫹v80 combination did not increase plasma

angiotensins. the renin and aldosterone effects of the
a150⫹v80 combination were similar to those of a300 and
greater than those of v160. when plasma drug concentrations
were taken into account, the a150 ⫹v80 combination had a
synergistic effect on renin release. the a150⫹v80 combination lowered bp at least as effectively as either higher dose
monotherapy. in conclusion, in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals, the long-lasting effects of  xxxd113xxx 
alone or in combination with  xxxd3487xxx  on plasma immunoreactive active renin and urinary aldosterone effects demonstrate
strong and prolonged blockade of  xxxg99xxx  at the kidney
and the adrenal level. moreover, a renin inhibitor and  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist combination may provide synergistic effects on
ras hormone levels.

numerous experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated
that the combination of currently available  xxxg99xxx – converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and  xxxg100xxx  ( xxxg100xxx )
antagonists provides additive or synergistic effects on bp lowering (1) and on the prevention of cardiovascular (2) and renal
lesions (3). these observations have previously been explained
by  xxxg100xxx  blockers inhibiting the effects of non–ace-dependent  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) production (4,5) or by the bradykinin-no–related effects of ace inhibition (6). however, the
additive effects of low doses of two different renin angiotensin
system (ras) inhibitors may be better explained by inhibition
of the biologic effects of the reactive renin release that is

triggered by single-site ras blockade. the amount of compensatory renin release is proportional to the extent of decrease
in the amount of ang ii generated or bound to the  xxxg100xxx  of the
renal juxtaglomerular cells. this counterregulation may be
overcome by using higher-than-usual or repeated doses of
single-site ras blockers (7,8) or by neutralizing the biologic
effects of the counterbalancing rise in active renin by using a
combined ras blockade.
direct demonstration of the importance of renin in this
counterregulatory mechanism has not previously been possible
in humans because of the absence of convenient orally available renin inhibitors. thus, we investigated whether a combination of the orally active potent alkane carboxamide renin
inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  (150 mg) (9,10) and the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist
 xxxd3487xxx  (80 mg), which inhibit the ras at the first and last
steps, respectively, results in a stronger blockade of the ras
and larger decreases in aldosterone excretion than higher doses
of each ras inhibitor given alone. synergistic effects of a
combination of a renin inhibitor and  xxxg100xxx  blocker on bp have
been demonstrated in a preclinical study (11). we have used
the same clinical and laboratory methods as those previously
used to differentiate the combination of an ace inhibitor and

 xxxg100xxx  antagonist from each component (12,13). the present
study therefore compared, in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive volunteers, the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship on renin release of a single oral dose of a 150-mg
 xxxd113xxx – 80-mg  xxxd3487xxx  combination with those of 300 mg
of  xxxd113xxx  and 160 mg of  xxxd3487xxx .

materials and methods
study design
a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomized,
four-period, crossover study design with 2-wk washout intervals was
used. the protocol was approved by the comité consultatif de protection des personnes se prêtant à des recherches biomédicales
(paris-cochin, france), and the procedures followed were in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. after giving informed, written
consent, 12 healthy white normotensive male volunteers (aged between 18 and 35 yr) received a single oral dose of 300 mg of  xxxd113xxx 
(a300), 160 mg of  xxxd3487xxx  (v160), a combination of these two drugs
(each at half dose; a150⫹v80), or matched placebos. treatments
were allocated according to the latin square design.  xxxd113xxx  (filmcoated tablet),  xxxd3487xxx , and placebo were placed in capsules that
were identical in appearance.  xxxd3426xxx -mg dose of  xxxd113xxx  was used
because this was the highest dose so far tested in early phase ii trials
in hypertensive patients (10). a 160-mg dose of  xxxd3487xxx  was used as
this is the standard registered daily dose in several countries and the
highest dose in the  xxxd3487xxx  antihypertensive long-term use evaluation (value) trial (14). in the combination treatment, the dose of
each drug was halved to test whether this ras blockade had a
synergistic/additive effect on renin release, aldosterone excretion, and
bp lowering.

study protocol
mild sodium depletion, which results in a two- to threefold increase
in plasma active renin concentration, was used to amplify the renin
response to ras blockade and to provide optimal conditions to
unmask the renin dependence of bp in the normotensive volunteers
(12,13). volunteers were instructed to arrive at the clinical investigation center at 6 p.m. on the evening before each phase of the study
(day 0). mild sodium depletion was induced on day 0 by giving
volunteers a single oral dose of 40 mg of furosemide at 9 p.m. and
supplying them with a sodium-restricted diet (30 mmol/d) during each
60-h treatment period as described previously (12,13). between treatment periods, sodium intake was unrestricted.
at 9 a.m. on the study day (day 1), volunteers received the study
drugs, their combination, or matched placebos, according to the randomization schedule, after a 1-h period of rest in a semirecumbent
position to allow for equilibration of bp, heart rate, and hormones.
fluid intake was unrestricted on the study days (1500 to 2000 ml/24
h). volunteers remained in a resting, semirecumbent position for
blood sampling and bp measurements. all volunteers were in a
fasting state from 12 h before to 6 h after drug administration. blood
was sampled before and at various time points after drug intake for
plasma active renin, plasma renin activity (pra; measured by the
trapping assay), plasma ang i and ang ii, aldosterone, and circulating
drug levels. pra measures the enzymatic activity of active renin in
plasma and investigates the inhibitory effect of  xxxd113xxx . plasma
active renin is determined using an immunoradiometric assay and
measures the number of active renin molecules independent of their
enzymatic activity (15). mean arterial pressure (map; mean of 10
measurements performed at 2-min intervals) was determined using an
automatic validated bp recorder (press mate bp 8800; colin co.,

renin inhibitor– xxxg100xxx  blocker combination

komaki-city, japan). urine volume and aldosterone extractable at
 xxxg102xxx  were measured for each fractionated urine sample.

laboratory methods
the methods and antibodies used for sampling and determining
plasma and urine hormones were as described in a previous clinical
investigation of renin inhibitors (16,17). circulating levels of  xxxd113xxx 
and  xxxd3487xxx  were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem
mass spectrometric detection (lc/ms/ms) (detection limits, 0.5 ng/ml
and 20 ng/ml, respectively). the peak plasma concentration (cmax), time
to peak (tmax), the area under the curve up to the last measured time point
(auc0 – 48), and the auc extrapolated to infinity (auc0 –⬁) were determined for each individual concentration-time profile (a300, a150, v160,
and v80) by a noncompartmental method using winnonlin pro 4.0
software (mountain view, ca).

statistical analyses
data were analyzed by anova for a four-by-four crossover
design (18). when the f test was significant (p ⬍ 0.05), paired
comparisons were made between specific treatments, using the holm
procedure (19). regression was estimated by the least squares
method. stata statistical software (release 7.0; college station, tx)
was used for statistical analysis. data are expressed as geometric
means with 95% confidence intervals (ci) for non-normal data and as
means ⫾ 1 sd for normally distributed data. p ⬍ 0.05 was considered
to be significant.

results
as expected, the baseline levels of pra, plasma active
renin, ang i, ang ii, and aldosterone were high in the mildly
sodium-depleted volunteers.

effects of a300, v160, and the a150⫹v80
combination on pra
a300 and v160 had opposing effects on pra. a300 completely inhibited pra within 1 h of intake, and this inhibition
persisted for 48 h. by contrast, pra increased considerably
within 4 h of v160 intake and was still higher than placebo at
24 and 48 h after dosing (table 1, figure 1).
in volunteers who were treated with the a150⫹v80 combination, pra was reduced below control values within 1 h of
drug administration, in contrast with the increase in pra
observed with v160. pra returned thereafter to baseline levels
12 h after a150⫹v80 intake and from this point onward was
not different from placebo.

effects of a300, v160, and the a150⫹v80
combination on plasma active renin concentration
baseline plasma active renin concentrations were high and
significantly correlated with baseline pra (r ⫽ 0.70, p ⬍
0.001, not shown). placebo intake was associated with an
increase in plasma active renin concentration from 42 (95% ci;
33 to 54) to 73 (95% ci; 54 to 98) pg/ml at 48 h; this was due
to the effects of sodium restriction. all active drugs given
alone or in combination massively increased plasma active
renin levels from baseline within 4 h of drug intake, and all had
a similar 48-h plasma active renin profile (table 1, figure 2).

combination was of similar magnitude to that observed with a300
alone and significantly higher than after v160 alone. the duration
of the increase in plasma active renin concentration was significantly longer for a300 or a150⫹v80 than for v160, as indicated
by the significantly higher 24- and 48-h post-dose plasma active
renin concentrations and auc values (table 1). the auc values
of plasma active renin concentration for a300 and the
a150⫹v80 combination were similar, but plasma active renin
concentration 48 h after a300 intake was significantly higher than
that after intake of the a150⫹v80 combination (table 1).

pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions that
affect plasma active renin concentration
the tmax of  xxxd113xxx  occurred earlier than that of  xxxd3487xxx ,
and the plasma half-life of  xxxd113xxx  was longer than that of
 xxxd3487xxx  (table 2). auc and cmax increased overproportionally with respect to the dose administered for both  xxxd113xxx  and
 xxxd3487xxx , with auc0 –24 ratios for a300 to a150 of 4.4 (95%
ci, 3.1 to 6.2) and for v160 to v80 of 2.9 (95% ci, 2.2 to 3.9;
table 2). between-subject variability in cmax and auc was
similar for  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx .
to adjust for the nonproportionality in the increase of the
plasma drug concentration to the dose administered, we calculated for each volunteer the ratio of the auc0 –24 for absolute
changes in plasma active renin concentration to the auc0 –24
for plasma  xxxd113xxx  or  xxxd3487xxx  concentrations. this analysis
defines for each individual a normalized index of active renin
release or “renin/pharmacokinetic index” (rpi), expressed in
pg active renin/ml per ng drug/ml (20). the rpi calculated for
a300 was 7.87 pg/ml per ng/ml (95% ci, 6.21 to 9.97), and the
rpi calculated for v160 was 0.34 pg/ml per ng/ml (95% ci,
0.21 to 0.55).

effects of a300, v160, and the a150⫹v80
combination on plasma ang i and ang ii
concentrations
baseline plasma ang i and ang ii concentrations were strongly
correlated with plasma active renin concentrations (r ⫽ 0.91 and

volunteers who were given the a150⫹v80 combination, plasma
levels of both ang i and ang ii remained similar to the values
measured after placebo administration, in contrast to the increase
in both peptides that was observed with v160 (table 3, figure 2).

effects of a300, v160, and the a150⫹v80
combination on plasma and urinary
aldosterone concentrations
plasma and urinary aldosterone concentrations followed a
circadian rhythm. in comparison with placebo, a300, v160,
and the a150⫹v80 combination significantly decreased
plasma aldosterone concentrations for 6 h after drug intake;
there was no significant difference in effect between the active
treatments (58 ⫾ 16 versus 52 ⫾ 22 versus 56 ⫾ 21%,
respectively; ns) (table 4). in parallel, urinary aldosterone
concentrations were significantly lower after administration of
a300, v160, or the a150⫹v80 combination compared with
placebo, with no significant differences in effect among the
active treatments during the 8 h after drug intake (table 4,
figure 3). compared with placebo, a300 and the a150⫹v80
combination suppressed urine aldosterone excretion for up to
24 h after drug intake, whereas the effect of v160 on urinary
aldosterone concentration persisted for no more than 12 to
18 h. both a300 and the a150⫹v80 combination reduced
24-h cumulative urine aldosterone excretion to a significantly
greater extent than v160 (table 4, figure 3).

effects of a300, v160, and the a150⫹v80
combination on map
compared with placebo, a300, v160, and the a150⫹v80
combination significantly decreased map within 4 h of drug
intake. there were no significant differences between a300,
v160, and the lower dose combination in terms of the extent of
map reduction. twenty-four hours after drug intake, the difference between the active treatments and placebo was no
longer significant in the mildly sodium-depleted normotensive
volunteers investigated in this study. in addition, when the
decrease in map was assessed by the auc0 –24 of map
decrease, the three active treatments differed from placebo but
the difference between treatments in paired comparisons was
ns (table 5).

discussion
r ⫽ 0.93, p ⬍ 0.001, respectively, not shown). after treatment
with a300, v160, or the a150⫹v80 combination, plasma ang i
and ang ii profiles followed the same pattern as the pra profiles
(table 3, figure 2). the concentrations of ang i and ang ii
increased in parallel in response to v160 for up to 48 h after drug
intake. in contrast, a300 significantly decreased plasma ang i and
ang ii concentrations to very low levels, which remained significantly lower than those measured after placebo for ⬎24 h. in

the results of the present study show that in mildly sodiumdepleted normotensive individuals, the ras blockade induced
by a low dose of an  xxxg100xxx  antagonist can be enhanced by
inhibiting renin activity, through co-administration of a potent,
orally active, long-lasting renin inhibitor. the enhanced ras
blockade generated by the combined treatment at low doses
resulted in greater plasma immunoreactive active renin and
urinary aldosterone effects than those of the standard 160-mg
dose of  xxxd3487xxx  in monotherapy. the renin and aldosterone

effects of the combination were similar to those of the high
300-mg dose of  xxxd113xxx  in monotherapy. the a150⫹v80
combination lowered bp at least as effectively as either higher
dose monotherapy .

comparison of the hormonal effects of the renin
inhibitor and the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist and analysis
of the rpi
our results showed that in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals, (1)  xxxd113xxx  decreases pra and plasma
ang i and ang ii concentrations in a dose-dependent manner
for up to 48 h after intake, confirming that it is a potent, orally
active, long-lasting renin inhibitor; and (2) a single oral dose of
a300 stimulated greater immunoreactive active renin release
from the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney than the standard
daily dose of v160.
the potency of  xxxd113xxx  by comparison with  xxxd3487xxx  was
assessed according to the plasma levels achieved by each drug, by
the calculation of the rpi. the rpi is a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index that takes into account actual drug exposure
rather than the oral dose of the drug administered and has been
used previously to characterize two different  xxxg100xxx  antagonists,

 xxxd3487xxx  and candesartan (20). this correction is especially important in studies in which drug pharmacokinetics are nonlinear,
as was the case in the present study. the rpi for a300 was 7.87
pg/ml per ng/ml (95% ci, 6.21 to 9.97), and that for v160 was
0.34 pg/ml per ng/ml (95% ci, 0.21 to 0.55). thus, according to
the rpi, exposure to ~20 times more  xxxd3487xxx  than  xxxd113xxx  is
required to trigger the release of one renin molecule in plasma.
finally, the duration of the decrease in urinary aldosterone
was longer after a300 treatment than after v160 treatment.
however, the decrease in bp was similar for both drugs in
these mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals.

combined blockade of the ras by  xxxd113xxx 
and  xxxd3487xxx 
we have compared the effects on hormone and bp levels of
a high dose of a renin inhibitor or a standard dose of an  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist given alone with those of each of these components
administered in combination (at half dose). under conditions in
which the pharmacokinetic parameters of neither drug were
modified when the drugs were combined, combination of
 xxxd113xxx  with  xxxd3487xxx  prevented the increase in pra and
plasma ang i and ang ii concentrations that was observed with

 xxxd3487xxx  alone. the auc0 –24 of plasma active renin concentration for the a150⫹v80 combination was significantly
higher than that achieved with 160 mg of  xxxd3487xxx  and similar
to that achieved by a300 alone. a300 and the a150⫹v80
combination decreased urinary aldosterone excretion for a similar duration, whereas v160 had a shorter effect. a300 and the
a150⫹v80 combination thus seemed to be equipotent with
regard to these two parameters. however, to interpret these
results correctly, we must take into account that plasma
 xxxd113xxx  concentration does not increase proportionally to the
dose given. the plasma concentrations of  xxxd113xxx  increased
by a factor of 4.4 (95% ci, 3.1 to 6.2), rather than by two, when
the dose was doubled from 150 to 300 mg. this observation
accounts for the larger-than-expected increase in the amount of
renin released in response to a300, because the amount of
renin release is directly related to the  xxxd113xxx  concentration
achieved at the level of the juxtaglomerular cells. after taking
this nonproportionality into account, we can conclude that
there is a synergistic effect on immunoreactive active renin
release and on the decrease in urinary aldosterone excretion
when these doses of a renin inhibitor (a150) and an  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist (v80) are combined. in mildly sodium-depleted
normotensive individuals, lower dose combination therapy
lowered bp to a similar extent as either high-dose  xxxd113xxx 
monotherapy or standard-dose  xxxd3487xxx  monotherapy. this
may be due to the limited range of bp variation that can be
detected in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals,
the large within-subject bp variability, and the low statistical
power of the study for this parameter. the bp effects of a
combination treatment associating various doses of  xxxd113xxx 
and  xxxd3487xxx  need to be investigated in hypertensive patients.
combined ras inhibition makes it possible to use lower
doses of each component to achieve a more effective and
long-lasting ras blockade (1). we show that, when nonlinearity of drug pharmacokinetics is taken into account, a combination of  xxxd113xxx  (150 mg) and  xxxd3487xxx  (80 mg) provided

more effective ras inhibition than double the dose of the at1
receptor antagonist (160 mg) or renin inhibitor (300 mg) alone.
the question of the influence of dose selection and dosing
interval remains critical for all ras inhibitors and their effects
on bp and end-organ protection (21–23). the additive or
synergistic effects of such combinations are more evident at
low doses (which are the usual dose) than at high doses (22).
an additional advantage of synergy or additivity between two
antihypertensive drugs, therefore, is that the doses of individual
drugs may be reduced to achieve the same therapeutic response. in summary, as with the dual ras blockade generated
by combining an  xxxg100xxx  antagonist and an ace inhibitor (1),
the combination of two pharmacologic agents inhibiting the
initial and final steps of the ras (renin and the  xxxg100xxx ,
respectively) minimizes or even overcomes the “escape” that
occurs with single-site ras blockade in an acute setting.

potential impact of the results
the long duration of action of  xxxd113xxx , alone or in combination with  xxxd3487xxx , on the increase in plasma immunoreactive active renin and the decrease in urinary aldosterone is an
interesting finding. it suggests that in both the kidneys and the
adrenal glands, ang ii can be efficiently blocked through renin
inhibition with  xxxd113xxx . these favorable effects of  xxxd113xxx 
may be due to a combination of the long plasma half-life of this
drug and its high affinity for human renin in the low nanomolar
range (24), which compensates for its low (2.6%) oral bioavailability. as observed with another renin inhibitor,  xxxd3095xxx 
(25), uptake by the kidney might also provide a drug reservoir
that may prolong its intrarenal pharmacologic activity. such
characteristics may have useful clinical consequences. hollenberg et al. (26) showed that renin inhibitors induce a greater
renal vasodilator response than ace inhibitors in sodiumrestricted healthy subjects, an observation also made with
 xxxd3095xxx  in guinea pigs (27). under circumstances in which
intrarenal activation of ang ii production occurs via ace- or
non–ace-dependent pathways, such as in diabetic nephropathy or in black hypertensive individuals on a high-salt diet (28),
specific renal benefits thus are expected from renin inhibition
in renal tissue (29) by the administration of an orally active
renin inhibitor. this would be especially true if the mechanisms of intrarenal renin suppression are deficient in these
forms of hypertension in humans (30). finally, the prolonged

inhibition of aldosterone excretion by  xxxd113xxx  alone or in
combination with  xxxd3487xxx , which may also be due to direct
inhibition of the adrenal ras (31), may be per se potentially
beneficial to patients with chronic nephropathies (32).
these investigations of single-dose administration in mildly
sodium-depleted normotensive individuals were performed to
test the plausibility of a pharmacologic synergy or additivity of
two ras inhibitors acting at different steps of the pathway,
renin and at1 receptors. they have shown that the interruption of the ras at the level of the ang ii–renin feedback with
a low-dose combination of  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  is similar to
a high dose of  xxxd113xxx  but more marked than with the standard
dose of  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg. these results support further clinical
studies at different doses of these compounds to investigate the
long-term effects of renin inhibitor– xxxg100xxx  antagonist combinations in various clinical contexts, including hypertension,
chronic proteinuric nephropathies, and chronic heart failure.
indeed, results obtained in recent clinical trials suggest enhanced nephroprotective (3) and cardioprotective (2) effects of
the dual ras blockade with ace inhibitors and  xxxg100xxx 
antagonists.
