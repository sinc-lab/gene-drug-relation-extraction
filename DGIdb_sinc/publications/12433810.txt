abstract:
(ⴚ), enantiomer of atorvastatin increased the amount of hmg-coa
reductase mrna, treatment with each enantiomer significantly
induced both  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  mrna levels. treatment of primary cultured rat hepatocytes with the atorvastatin enantiomers
effectively increased the amount of  xxxg590xxx  mrna, but had no
effect on  xxxg583xxx  or cyp4a mrna levels, in contrast to fluvastatin,
which increased both. findings for p450 proteins by western blotting were consistent with the mrna results. these findings indicate that the ability of a drug to inhibit  xxxg1060xxx  activity
does not predict its ability to produce p450 induction in primary
cultured human hepatocytes, and demonstrate that some, but not
all, of the effects of these drugs that occur in primary cultured rat
hepatocytes are conserved in human hepatocyte cultures.

inhibitors of  xxxg1060xxx 
(hmg-coa reductase2 ), also known as “statins”, have achieved an
important place in the arsenal of therapeutic agents available for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the
united states. five drugs of this class are currently approved for use
in the united states, namely, lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin,
fluvastatin, and atorvastatin (food and drug adminstration orange
book; http://www.fda.gov/cder/ob/default.htm). in general, these drugs
have proven to be safe and effective when taken over a period of years
(davidson, 2001), and additional therapeutic uses of these drugs are
under investigation (white, 1999; puddu et al., 2001; whitfield, 2001).

however, one precaution in the use of these drugs is that most of them
have been shown to interact, in one manner or another, with the cytochrome p450 system of drug-metabolizing enzymes, thereby leading to
the possibility for pharmacokinetic interactions with coadministered
drugs. thus, abundant information indicates that lovastatin, simvastatin,
and atorvastatin interact with human  xxxg590xxx , both as substrates and
inhibitors (prueksaritanont et al., 1997; beaird, 2000; cohen et al., 2000;
farmer and torre-amione, 2000), whereas the highest affinity interactions involving fluvastatin are with cyp2c9 (transon et al., 1996;
beaird, 2000; cohen et al., 2000; farmer and torre-amione, 2000;
scripture and pieper, 2001). pharmacokinetic interactions, presumed to
be based on  xxxg590xxx  inhibition, have been described between simvastatin
and diltiazem (mousa et al., 2000), as well as between simvastatin or
atorvastatin and the protease inhibitor nelfinavir (hsyu et al., 2001). in
contrast,  xxxg590xxx  inhibitors have no effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics (scripture and pieper, 2001). unlike the other  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors, pravastatin does not seem to interact substantially with the
p450 system, either as substrate or inhibitor (beaird, 2000; cohen et al.,
2000; farmer and torre-amione, 2000), and, consistent with these findings,  xxxd2638xxx , a potent  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor, had no effect on pravastatin
pharmacokinetics (becquemont et al., 1999).
also, several of the  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors have been
shown to increase the expression of cytochromes p450. for example,
we previously demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat
hepatocytes with lovastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin increased the
levels of  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg590xxx , and cyp4a mrna and immunoreactive

the effects of treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  reductase ( xxxg1060xxx ) inhibitors lovastatin,
simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin on the contents of cytochrome p450 mrnas were examined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes prepared from three different livers.
treatment of 2- to 3-day-old human hepatocyte cultures with 3 ⴛ
10ⴚ5 m lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or atorvastatin for 24 h
increased the amounts of  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  mrna by an average of 3.8- to 9.2-fold and 24- to 36-fold, respectively. in contrast,
pravastatin treatment had no effect on the mrna level of either
 xxxg583xxx  or  xxxg590xxx , although treatment with pravastatin did produce the expected compensatory increase in  xxxg1060xxx 
mrna content, indicating effective inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. although treatment with the active (ⴙ), but not the inactive

materials and methods
materials. lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin were obtained from the sources described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996).
atorvastatin and inactive enantiomer were gifts from pfizer global research
and development (ann arbor, mi). matrigel was purchased from collaborative research (bedford, ma). cell culture supplies and protein molecular
weight markers were purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). precast
polyacrylamide gels were purchased from bio-rad (hercules, ca). ecl
western blotting detection reagents were purchased from amersham biosciences (piscataway, nj). other supplies were obtained from the sources
described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996).
isolation and primary culture of human hepatocytes. three highquality human livers that were judged to be unsuitable for transplantation were
obtained from the transplant society of michigan, and hepatocytes were
prepared under a protocol approved by the wayne state university human
investigation committee, as described recently (duanmu et al., 2002). after
the final wash, hepatocytes were suspended in williams’ medium e containing
0.25 u/ml insulin, 10⫺7 m  xxxd3418xxx , penicillin, and streptomycin (defined as standard williams’ medium e), and yield and viability were
estimated by counting trypan blue-stained samples, using a hemocytometer.
the mean yield was 1.5 ⫻ 109 viable hepatocytes, with an average viability at
isolation of 78%. the hepatocytes were diluted into standard williams’ medium e containing  xxxd3418xxx  and 10% fetal bovine serum and
were plated at 3 million viable cells/dish onto 60-mm dishes that were

freshly isolated hepatocytes were prepared from three different human livers and
placed into primary culture, as described under materials and methods. approximately 48 h after plating, the cultures were incubated with williams’ medium e
alone (ut) or containing 0.1% dmso (vehicle control), 10⫺5 m ␤-naphthoflavone
(bnf, in dmso), 10⫺4 m phenobarbital (pb, in water), 10⫺5 m dexamethasone
(dex, in dmso), 10⫺4 m ciprofibrate (cipro, in dmso), 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m lovastatin
(lova, in aqueous vehicle), 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m simvastatin (simva, in aqueous vehicle),
3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m pravastatin (prava, in water), 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m fluvastatin (fluva, in water),
or 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m of the active (atorva) or inactive (3s,5s-atorva) enantiomer of
atorvastatin (in dmso). twenty-four hours after treatment, hepatocytes were harvested for the preparation of total rna, followed by analysis of  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg590xxx ,
and  xxxg1060xxx  (hmgred) mrna levels by northern blot hybridization.
after initial hybridization of membranes with the  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg590xxx  or hmg-coa
reductase cdna probe, blots were rehybridized with a cdna to 7s rna, to permit
normalization for loading and transfer among samples. left, autoradiographs of

precoated with 1.5 mg matrigel, as described previously (kocarek and reddy,
1996). after 3 to 10 h, the medium was replaced with standard williams’
medium e, but lacking serum. forty-eight to 72 h after plating, cultures were
treated with drugs (3 to 5 dishes/treatment group), as described in the legend
to fig. 1. twenty-four hours after treatment, hepatocytes were harvested for
measurement of p450 and  xxxg1060xxx  mrna levels by northern
blot hybridization.
hepatocytes from an additional donor were prepared at the university of
pittsburgh medical center (strom et al., 1996) and plated onto collagen-coated
t25 flasks (approximately 3 million hepatocytes/flask). two days after plating,
medium was replaced with 5 ml of standard williams’ medium e (as described
above) containing 1 mg of matrigel. the following day, the medium was
replaced with standard williams’ medium e (without matrigel) and cultures
were treated with drugs (2 flasks/treatment group), as described in the legend

protein (kocarek and reddy, 1996). fluvastatin was a particularly
efficacious inducer of  xxxg583xxx  in the hepatocyte cultures and also
increased the contents of  xxxg583xxx  and cyp4a, but not  xxxg590xxx ,
mrna and immunoreactive protein in the livers of treated rats (kocarek and reddy, 1996). in contrast, pravastatin was completely
without effect on the expression of any of the p450s that were
examined in the rat hepatocyte cultures (kocarek and reddy, 1996).
lovastatin has also been shown to induce  xxxg590xxx  in primary cultured
rabbit (kocarek et al., 1995) and human (schuetz et al., 1993) hepatocytes, as well as in hepg2 cells (schuetz et al., 1993), whereas
atorvastatin has been reported to induce cyp2c9 activity in monkey
hepatocytes (cohen et al., 2000). after the discovery that the  xxxg1598xxx 
mediates the effects of many  xxxg590xxx -inducing agents, lehmann et al.
(1998) demonstrated, using a transactivation assay in cv-1 cells, that
lovastatin markedly activated human  xxxg1598xxx  (also called steroid and
xenobiotic receptor), and, to a lesser extent, mouse  xxxg1598xxx . more
recently, el-sankary et al. (2001) demonstrated that lovastatin and
simvastatin, but not pravastatin, activated transcription from a
cyp3a4 reporter plasmid in transiently transfected hepg2 cells, and
the inductions were substantially augmented by cotransfection of
human  xxxg1601xxx  and  xxxg1598xxx . however, one limitation of
such studies is that  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors are highly toxic to
replicating cell lines, because these drugs block not only sterol production but also the prenylation reactions that are essential for cell
replication.
presently, there is no information on the effects of hmg-coa
reductase inhibitors on p450 expression in primary cultured human
hepatocytes, other than the aforementioned effects of lovastatin on
 xxxg590xxx . also, no studies in a human system have been performed that
attempt to evaluate whether the effects of these agents on p450
expression are the result of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition, or
whether the effects are more likely the result of direct drug-mediated
activation of the  xxxg1598xxx  or other xenobiotic-sensing receptor. thus, the
purpose of this study was first, to evaluate the effects of members of
this important class of therapeutic agents on p450 expression in
primary cultured human hepatocytes, and second, to take advantage of
known pharmacological differences among this family of drugs, by
using them to query the mechanisms by which  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors regulate p450 expression.

drugs were added to the cultures as concentrated stock solutions in water
(phenobarbital, pravastatin, and fluvastatin) or dmso (␤-naphthoflavone,
dexamethasone, ciprofibrate, atorvastatin, and atorvastatin inactive enantiomer; the final media concentration of dmso was 0.1%). aqueous stock
solutions of the active hydroxyacid forms of lovastatin and simvastatin were
prepared as described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996).
primary culture of rat hepatocytes. hepatocytes were isolated from the
livers of adult male sprague-dawley rats (approximately 300 g) under a
protocol approved by the wayne state university animal investigation committee, as described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996). after isolation, 3
million viable hepatocytes were plated onto 60-mm matrigel-coated dishes and
maintained in standard williams’ medium e, as described above. forty-eight
hours after plating, cultures were treated with drugs for 24 h (3 dishes/
treatment group), as described in the legend to fig. 3.
northern blot analysis. the three to five dishes of hepatocytes constituting each treatment group were pooled for the preparation of total rna,
as described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996). ten-microgram samples of the pooled rnas were resolved on denaturing agarose gels and
analyzed by northern blot hybridization, as described previously (kocarek
and reddy, 1996). cdna probes to  xxxg575xxx ,  xxxg583xxx , and  xxxg593xxx  were
gifts from drs. john j. reiners, jr. (wayne state university, detroit, mi),
frank gonzalez (national cancer institute, bethesda, md), and erin
schuetz (st. jude children’s research hospital, memphis, tn), respectively. a cdna corresponding to base pairs 580 to 2613 of  xxxg594xxx 
(genbank gi 13435387) was prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction amplification, using human hepatic total rna as template.
a cdna probe to human  xxxg1060xxx  (phred-102) was purchased from the american type culture collection (manassas, va). other
cdna probes were obtained from the sources described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996). after hybridization with the p450 or hmg-coa
reductase cdna probes, hybridizable bands were identified by autoradiography, and their intensities were estimated by scanning laser densitometry
(molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca). radiolabeled probes were then
removed from the filters by incubation in 1% sds at 90°c, and blots were
rehybridized with 7s cdna, to control for rna loading and transfer. to
permit statistical analysis of the human hepatocyte northern blot data, each
data point (i.e., each p450 or  xxxg1060xxx  band) on a blot was first
normalized to the corresponding amount of 7s rna detected in that
sample. second, to normalize data across the three experiments, each data
point was then calculated as a percentage of the amount of rna that was

freshly isolated hepatocytes were prepared from two different rat livers and
placed into primary culture, as described under materials and methods. forty-eight
hours after plating, the cultures were incubated with williams’ medium e alone
(ut), or containing 0.1% dmso (vehicle control), 10⫺5 m ␤-naphthoflavone
(bnf, in dmso), 10⫺4 m phenobarbital (pb, in water), 10⫺5 m dexamethasone

(fluva, in water), or 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m of the active (atorva) or inactive (3s, 5s-atorva)
enantiomer of atorvastatin (in dmso). twenty-four hours after treatment, hepatocytes were harvested for the preparation of total rna, followed by analysis of
 xxxg575xxx ,  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg590xxx , cyp4a, and  xxxg1060xxx  (hmgred) mrna
levels by northern blot hybridization. after initial hybridization of membranes with

mrna present in the positive control group at 100%, it permitted calculation of a mean mrna level ⫾ s.d. for each of the other treatment groups.

western blot analysis. the two flasks of hepatocytes constituting each
treatment group were pooled for the preparation of microsomes, as described
previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996). either 10 ␮g (for measurement of
 xxxg583xxx  levels) or 1 ␮g (for measurement of  xxxg590xxx  levels) of microsomal
protein was resolved by sds-page (10% acrylamide) and electrophoretically
transferred to nitrocellulose filters, using a mini-protean electrophoresis unit
(bio-rad), as described previously (kocarek and reddy, 1996). a polyclonal
antibody directed against a  xxxg583xxx  peptide (wb-2b6-pep, catalog number
458226) and a monoclonal antibody directed against human  xxxg590xxx  proteins
(wb-mab-3a, catalog number 458254) were purchased from gentest
(woburn, ma), as were protein standards (i.e., human  xxxg583xxx  microsomes
and human cyp3a4⫹p450 reductase microsomes). membranes were blocked
and developed with antibodies, as recommended by gentest, except that the
primary antibody concentrations were reduced to 1:6,000 for wb-2b6-pep
and 1:20,000 for wb-mab-3a, and incubations were conducted overnight at

flasks containing human hepatocytes attached to a collagen substratum, prepared
from a single donor, were maintained in primary culture, as described under
materials and methods. approximately 48 h after plating, the cultures were overlaid
with matrigel, and 72 h after plating were incubated with williams’ medium e
alone (ut), or containing 0.1% dmso (vehicle control), 10⫺5 m ␤-naphthoflavone
(bnf, in dmso), 10⫺4 m phenobarbital (pb, in water), 10⫺5 m dexamethasone
(dex, in dmso), 10⫺4 m ciprofibrate (cipro, in dmso), 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m lovastatin

or 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m of the active (atorva) or inactive (3s,5s-atorva) enantiomer of
atorvastatin (in dmso). twenty-four hours after treatment, hepatocytes were harvested for the preparation of microsomes, followed by analysis of  xxxg583xxx  and
 xxxg590xxx  immunoreactive protein levels by western blot hybridization and enhanced
chemiluminescent detection. the standards consist of microsomes containing 0.5

jackson immunoresearch laboratories (west grove, pa), consisted of goat
anti-rabbit (for  xxxg583xxx , used at 1:10,000) and goat anti-mouse (for  xxxg590xxx ,
used at 1:20,000). after hybridization with antibodies, immunoreactive bands
were identified by enhanced chemiluminescence, and intensities were estimated by scanning laser densitometry.

results

served as a positive control for both  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  mrna
induction, consistently elevated the levels of these mrnas. these
results support other recent observations that  xxxg583xxx  is a highly
inducible p450 (strom et al., 1996; chang et al., 1997; gervot et
al., 1999; pascussi et al., 2000; gerbal-chaloin et al., 2001; goodwin et al., 2001). also, in each preparation, treatment with lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or atorvastatin, but not pravastatin,
increased the content of  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  mrnas. all of the
increases (3.8- to 9.2-fold for  xxxg583xxx ; 24- to 36-fold for  xxxg590xxx )
were statistically significant, relative to vehicle-treated controls,
with the sole exception that the effect of simvastatin treatment on
 xxxg583xxx  mrna content, which was still 4.5-fold, did not achieve
statistical significance (fig. 1, right). treatment with each of the
active  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors produced the expected compensatory increases in  xxxg1060xxx  mrna levels, which
are secondary to diminished sterol synthesis and content, followed
by activation of the srebp family of transcription factors (edwards et al., 2000). in support of this assessment, treatment with
the inactive atorvastatin enantiomer did not increase hmg-coa
reductase mrna levels in the hepatocyte cultures. of note, however, treatment with either atorvastatin or its inactive enantiomer
produced equivalent increases in the amounts of both  xxxg583xxx  and
 xxxg590xxx  mrnas.
as an additional observation, treatment with ␤-naphthoflavone
consistently and significantly increased the amount of  xxxg583xxx 
mrna in the human hepatocyte cultures (fig. 1). to our knowledge,
such an effect of ␤-naphthoflavone, which does not occur for  xxxg583xxx 
mrna in cultured rat hepatocytes (fig. 3), has not been reported
previously. finally, none of the  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors produced any consistent effect on  xxxg575xxx  or  xxxg594xxx  mrna levels in
the primary cultured human hepatocytes (data not shown).
to determine whether effects of  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors on
p450 expression also occurred at the protein level, an additional
preparation of human hepatocytes was treated with the drugs, and
amounts of  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  immunoreactive protein levels were
estimated by western blot hybridization (fig. 2). although western
blots developed with the wb-2b6-pep antibody exhibited some
nonspecific cross-reactivity, increases relative to untreated control in
the amount of immunoreactive protein comigrating with the  xxxg583xxx 
standard were clearly evident in cultures treated with lovastatin,
simvastatin, or fluvastatin, whereas no increase was observed in
pravastatin-treated cultures. also, as noted on the northern blots,
␤-naphthoflavone treatment produced a definite increase in the
amount of  xxxg583xxx  protein. results obtained with the wb-mab-3a
antibody indicated that treatment with lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and the atorvastatin isomers all produced marked increases in
the amount of  xxxg590xxx  immunoreactive protein (ranging from ⬃6- to
20-fold), whereas pravastatin treatment again had no effect. these
findings indicated that the effects of the  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors on p450 expression that were observed at the mrna level were
generally maintained at the protein level.
in our previous report (kocarek and reddy, 1996), we did not
determine the effects of atorvastatin on p450 expression in primary
cultured rat hepatocytes. we therefore examined the effects of treatment with this agent, or its inactive enantiomer, on p450 mrna

because the  xxxg593xxx  cdna and wb-mab-3a antibody used in this study
hybridize to all known human  xxxg590xxx  mrnas and proteins, respectively, we refer
to mrna(s) and immunoreactive protein(s) detected on human northern and
western blots generically as  xxxg590xxx . the same is true for the northern blots
conducted with the rat hepatocyte samples and probed with the cyp2b1,
cyp3a23, and cyp4a1 cdnas.

we previously reported that treatment of primary cultured rat
hepatocytes with lovastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin resulted in
induction of  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg590xxx , and cyp4a mrnas and immunoreactive proteins in primary cultured rat hepatocytes (kocarek and
reddy, 1996). fluvastatin was a particularly effective  xxxg583xxx 
inducer in the rat hepatocyte cultures (kocarek and reddy, 1996,
1998) and also increased  xxxg583xxx  and cyp4a mrna and protein
content in the livers of treated rats (kocarek and reddy, 1996). in
contrast, pravastatin was completely without effect on p450 expression in the rat hepatocyte cultures, despite effectively upregulating  xxxg1060xxx  mrna levels, thereby indicating
that the drug inhibited cellular cholesterol biosynthesis (kocarek
and reddy, 1996). to determine whether these effects on p450
expression are conserved in human hepatocytes, we have examined
the effects of treatments with these agents on p450 expression in
primary cultures of human hepatocytes. to use the human hepatocytes efficiently, we designed our experiments based on the
information we had gained from our previous rat studies. thus,
because the maximally effective concentration of the hmg-coa
reductase inhibitors in rat hepatocyte cultures was 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m, we
used this concentration in our experiments. also, because the
effects on p450 expression in the rat cultures were evident at both
the mrna and protein levels, and because one of our primary
goals is to understand the mechanism(s) by which these drugs
regulate p450 gene expression, we focused primarily on the effects
of treatments on mrna levels in the present study.
we also wished to extend our previous study to examine the
effect of an additional  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor, atorvastatin.
this synthetic  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor was approved for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia in 1997 (chong and seeger,
1997) and has since achieved widespread use, ranking as one of the
most prescribed drugs in the united states in 2000 (the internet
drug index: http://www.rxlist.com/top200.htm, site viewed on february 25, 2002). an additional advantage of atorvastatin, for experimental purposes, is that the drug is a pure enantiomer (⫹), and
an inactive enantiomer (⫺) of atorvastatin (i.e., that does not
inhibit  xxxg1060xxx ) was available for use. this provided
us with an opportunity to determine, using classical pharmacological criteria, whether effects on p450 expression are linked to
inhibition of  xxxg1060xxx  activity. although enantiomers
of fluvastatin have also been described (transon et al., 1996), we
were unable to obtain these for our studies. to consider the
possibility for substantial interindividual differences in drug effects, we repeated the study in hepatocyte cultures prepared from
three different human livers, and results from all three hepatocyte
culture experiments are shown (fig. 1, left). despite the concern
that differences in liver quality, or pharmacogenetic differences
among individuals, might lead to marked differences in outcome
among experiments, highly consistent effects were seen across the
three human hepatocyte culture experiments. thus, in each human
hepatocyte preparation, treatment with phenobarbital, which

content in rat hepatocyte cultures, with fluvastatin treatment serving
as a control for comparison (fig. 3). although fluvastatin treatment
produced the previously reported strong increases in  xxxg583xxx  and
cyp4a mrna levels, with a modest increase in  xxxg590xxx  mrna
content (kocarek and reddy, 1996), treatment with either atorvastatin
or its inactive enantiomer had no effect on either  xxxg583xxx  or cyp4a
mrna levels, but rather evoked a marked increase in  xxxg590xxx  mrna
levels, which approached 50% of the amount induced by dexamethasone treatment. again, as expected, only treatment with fluvastatin or
active atorvastatin, but not the inactive atorvastatin enantiomer,
caused a compensatory increase in  xxxg1060xxx  mrna
content. thus, the profile of p450 induction that was generated by
atorvastatin treatment of rat hepatocytes differed from that produced
by any of the other  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors that we have
examined (fig. 3; kocarek and reddy, 1996).

a major goal of this study was to obtain insight into whether the
effects of  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors on p450 gene expression
are mechanistically linked to  xxxg1060xxx  inhibition. thus,
even though lovastatin was previously shown to activate the human
 xxxg1598xxx  (lehmann et al., 1998), it remained possible that this effect was
mediated indirectly, as a result of cellular responses that were triggered by  xxxg1060xxx  inhibition. in this regard, it is now well
established that there is substantial interplay among the pathways
involved in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. as two examples,
kim et al. (1998) reported that expression of srebp1c in 3t3-l1
preadipocytes resulted in the production of an endogenous ligand for
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥. also, several groups
have reported that srebp1c expression is dependent on the ongoing
activation of the liver x receptor by oxysterols (repa et al., 2000;
debose-boyd et al., 2001; yoshikawa et al., 2001). because the  xxxg1598xxx ,
which is also activated by secondary bile acids such as lithocholic acid
(staudinger et al., 2001b; xie et al., 2001), has now been demonstrated to play a role in regulating hepatic sterol/bile acid homeostasis
(staudinger et al., 2001a), it seems possible that disruption of cellular
lipid metabolism by  xxxg1060xxx  blockade could trigger an
endogenous mechanism that leads to the activation of  xxxg1598xxx . our
results, in which both atorvastatin and its inactive enantiomer increased  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  mrna content with equal ability, and in
which pravastatin effectively blocked cholesterol biosynthesis but did
not elevate p450 mrna levels, strongly indicate that ability of a drug
to inhibit  xxxg1060xxx  activity does not predict its ability to
induce  xxxg583xxx  or  xxxg590xxx  in cultured human hepatocytes.
based on our findings, we conclude the following about the degree
of conservation of the effects of  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor treatments on p450 expression between rat and human. first, fluvastatin is
a highly effective  xxxg583xxx  inducer in both rat and human hepatocytes,
with lovastatin and simvastatin being somewhat less effective, especially in rat. in contrast, fluvastatin is no more effective as a  xxxg590xxx 
inducer than any of the other  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors tested in
the hepatocytes of either species. second, pravastatin treatment does
not increase  xxxg583xxx  or  xxxg590xxx  mrna or immunoreactive protein
content in either rat or human hepatocytes, although it clearly gains
entry into the cell and inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in both cases.
in fact, pravastatin treatment regularly produced the largest increases
in  xxxg1060xxx  mrna levels that were observed in the
human hepatocyte cultures, causing us to use this treatment as our
standard for data normalization. overall, therefore, pravastatin exhibits very little interaction with the p450 system, because previous
studies have demonstrated that pravastatin undergoes limited p450mediated metabolism and does not substantially inhibit the activity of

any human p450 (beaird, 2000; cohen et al., 2000; farmer and
torre-amione, 2000). also, our findings in primary cultured human
hepatocytes are in close agreement with the recently reported abilities
of lovastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, to activate transcription from a cyp3a4 reporter plasmid in transiently transfected
hepg2 cells (el-sankary et al., 2001).
a major difference in the effects of the drugs across species was
seen for atorvastatin, which increased the amount of only  xxxg590xxx 
mrna in the cultured rat hepatocytes, but increased both  xxxg583xxx 
and  xxxg590xxx  mrnas in the human hepatocyte cultures. based on
current mechanistic models of  xxxg583xxx  and  xxxg590xxx  induction, in
which  xxxg1598xxx  is the major nuclear receptor mediating the effects of
xenobiotics on  xxxg590xxx  expression (lehmann et al., 1998; jones et al.,
2000), whereas car is the principal receptor governing the effects of
phenobarbital and other agents on  xxxg583xxx  expression (wei et al.,
2000), one may speculate that lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin
are able to activate both car and  xxxg1598xxx  in rat hepatocytes, whereas
atorvastatin and its inactive enantiomer activate only  xxxg1598xxx . in contrast, in human hepatocytes, atorvastatin may be able to activate both
car and  xxxg1598xxx . alternatively,  xxxg1598xxx  has been shown to play a major
role in the xenobiotic-inducible regulation of  xxxg583xxx  (goodwin et
al., 2001). thus,  xxxg1598xxx , rather than car, may be the dominant transcription factor responsible for mediating  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor-inducible expression of  xxxg583xxx . these possibilities are currently
under investigation.
