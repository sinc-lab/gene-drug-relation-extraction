abstract
 xxxg1162xxx  ( xxxg1162xxx ) is a pleiotropic
growth factor with several actions in common
with members of the il-6 family.  xxxg1162xxx  utilizes
a specific receptor chain encoded by two genes,
il-llra, which is expressed in hematopoietic
and other tissues and, il-11ra2, which has a
restricted pattern of expression. the actions of
 xxxg1162xxx  in the hematopoietic compartment
include support of multilineage and committed
progenitors contributing to myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocyte, and lymphoid lineages.
 xxxg1162xxx  demonstrates a prominent thrombopoietic activity which is being evaluated in clinical
trials. in contrast to the multiple in vitro and in
vivo effects of  xxxg1162xxx , mice with a targeted

mutation of the  xxxg1163xxx  gene ( xxxg1163xxx -/-) did
not exhibit an overt hematological phenotype.
generation of a null phenotype was confirmed
by independent assays. the numbers of progenitor cells of various lineages as well as their
terminally differentiated progeny were undisturbed in the il-llra-/- mice. in addition, the
mutant mice were able to respond appropriately to increased demand in situations of
hematopoietic stress. this study has highlighted the growth factor redundancy operative in
the hematopoietic compartment, and in addition, has served to identify a critical action of
 xxxg1162xxx  in nonhematopoietic organs. stem cells

introduction
 xxxg1162xxx  ( xxxg1162xxx ) was originally identified as a stromal-cell-derived growth factor able to stimulate
the proliferation of a murine plasmacytoma cell line [ 1,2j. in addition to its action on the bcell lineage, its
ability to support the growth of multilineage progenitors was soon recognized. subsequently, the action
of il-1i on multiple hematopoietic lineages was demonstrated and reviewed [3-7]. however, the effects
of  xxxg1162xxx  are not restricted to hematopoiesis.  xxxg1162xxx  has effects on varied organs; for example, it aids
recovery of spermatogenesis after chemotherapy [s], ameliorates the effect on the intestinal epithelium
of cytotoxic injury and inflammatory bowel disease [9, 101, and is a possible mediator of bronchial reactivity [ 111. consistent with the known metabolic functions of il-1 i, the cdna was also independently
cloned by kuwushima et al. based on its ability to inhibit adipogenesis in 3t3-li cells [12]. the
nonhematopoietic actions of il-11have been recently reviewed [7j.
the pleiotropic actions of  xxxg1162xxx  on the hematopoietic compartment and other organ systems
are shared with those of other members of the il-6 family of growth factors, including leukemia

role of il- 11 in hematopoiesis

inhibitory factor (lif),  xxxg1637xxx  (osm), ciliary  xxxg1614xxx  (cntf), and cardiotrophin
(ct). the overlapping function of these growth factors is, in part, explained by shared receptor
components [ 13-15], for instance, the il-6 family of cytokines share gp130 as a signal transduction unit [ 14, 161. several of these molecules also utilize the lif receptor (lifr) as a component
of their receptor complex; also, specific receptor chains exist for osm, il-6, and cntf [14, 16,
171. work in our laboratory led to cloning of the cdnas encoding the murine and human
il- i 1-specific receptor subunit (a-chain) and the demonstration that the expression of this
receptor component alone confers low-affinity  xxxg1162xxx  binding. coexpression with gpl30 results in
high-affinity binding of  xxxg1162xxx  and the capacity for signal transduction [l8, 191. we have also previously described the presence of two loci for the murine  xxxg1162xxx  receptor a-chain,  xxxg1163xxx  and
il- 1 1ra2 [20, 2 i ] . while transcripts corresponding to the  xxxg1162xxx  ra locus are expressed widely in
hematopoietic and other organs, those from the il-12ra2 locus are detected only at relatively low
levels in the testis, lymph node, and thymus [20, 211. furthermore, the il-1 1ra2 locus is not present in all mouse strains; for example, sjl/j and dba/2j are two murine strains that contain only
the ubiquitously expressed  xxxg1163xxx  gene, while 129/sv, cs7bl/6, and balb/cby also contain
the il-11ra2 gene [20]. the cdnas from the two loci exhibit 99% nucleotide identity in the
coding exons, but contain different 5’ untranslated regions [20, 211. this divergence permits discrimination between transcripts from the two loci using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (rt-pcr).
despite the varied actions of  xxxg1162xxx  within the hematopoietic compartment, its principal
physiological role remains unclear. the generation of genetically modified animals is increasingly used to ascertain the in vivo importance of the molecules of interest. we sought to understand
the essential functions of il- 11 in vivo by generation of mice with a targeted null mutation of the
il-1 1ra gene [22]. here we describe the role of  xxxg1162xxx  in hematopoiesis as revealed by analysis
of the il-l 1ra receptor null (il-1 ira-/-) mice.

 xxxg1162xxx  and thrombopoiesis
it was initially observed by paul et al. and later confirmed by other investigators that il- 11 acting
alone had no megakaryocyte colony-forming activity in vitro but could augment this activity of
cytokines such as  xxxg1177xxx , stem cell factor (scf; or kit-ligand), and  xxxg2282xxx  (tpo) [1, 23-28].
il- 1 1 alone and in synergy with  xxxg1177xxx  also induces features of megakaryocyte maturation including
increased ploidy, size, and production of acetylcholinesterase [24, 261. in vivo experiments with il- 11
have demonstrated both an enhancement of megakaryocyte progenitors and an increase in platelet
production (see below). although megakaryocytes have been shown to express  xxxg1162xxx  receptors [29],
it has been speculated that the action of  xxxg1162xxx  on megakaryocytes is mediated through additional
growth factors. this question has been addressed, in part, by examining the effect of  xxxg1162xxx  on highly purified target populations in an attempt to eliminate contaminating stromal elements which
could act as a source of other factors. teramura et al. reported that  xxxg1162xxx  acting alone was able to
induce maturation markers in purified human cd4 1-positive cells [25]. as human megakaryocytes
have the potential to produce il-6 and to express receptors for il-6 [30], it was possible that the
action of  xxxg1162xxx  on purified megakaryocytes was mediated through il-6. however, the addition of
anti-il-6 antibody to the culture system was shown not to abrogate the response to il-1 i [2s]. as
the enormous potential of tpo to support megakaryopoiesis became apparent, kaushansky et al.
examined the possibility that tpo might mediate the thrombopoietic response to other growth factors,
including  xxxg1162xxx  [28]. the addition of soluble  xxxg1442xxx  receptor as a tpo antagonist abrogated il-6,
il- 1 1, or scf-induced in vitro megakaryocyte colony formation from unfractionated bone marrow
cells, suggesting a dependence on tpo [28]. the generation of mice deficient in tpo or  xxxg1442xxx  permitted this issue to be addressed in vivo [31-331. administration of il-6,  xxxg1162xxx , scf, or lif to these

mice resulted in a platelet increment [34, 3.51; thus, through demonstrating in vivo, these growth
factors can act independently of tpo.
support for the action of  xxxg1162xxx  in megakaryocytopoiesis has also come from the analysis of il-i 1
in animal models. administration of il-11to normal and splenectomized mice elevated platelet counts
in both groups and was associated with an increment in the number of megakaryocytes and progenitors
in bone marrow and spleen [36-381. il-11also induced megakaryocyte maturation in vivo; analysis of
bone marrow megakaryocytes revealed an increase in ploidy [36, 371. mice in which  xxxg1162xxx  was
overexpressed demonstrated a persistent elevation of platelets associated with an increment in
megakaryocytes [39-4 11.  xxxg1162xxx  also possesses megakaryopoietic and thrombopoietic action in monkeys [42] and dogs [43]. administration of  xxxg1162xxx  to humans also results in an elevation of platelet
count, increased megakaryocyte numbers in the marrow with a higher fraction in cell cycle, and a shift
to higher ploidy [44-461.
while the action of  xxxg1162xxx  on platelets is clear, there are conflicting data regarding the relationship
between circulating levels of  xxxg1162xxx  and the platelet/megakaryocyte mass. elevated il-l1 levels were
observed in patients with thrombocytopenia along with consequent increased megakaryocyte mass, as a
result of immune platelet destruction [47]. in contrast, tpo levels are not elevated in situations of
immune destruction as reviewed [48, 491. il-11levels were also noted to be elevated in patients with
thrombocytopenia and decreased megakaryocyte mass due to myelosuppression, with a significant
inverse correlation between endogenous il-1 1 levels and circulating platelet counts during recovery
[47]. this finding, however, has not been consistently observed [50].it is interesting that in mpl-null
mice with platelet counts 10%-15% of normal, no elevation of il-11levels has been observed [35]; thus,
unlike with tpo, there is no simple relationship between levels of serum il-11and total mass of cells
of the megakaryocyte lineage.
given the prominent activity of il-11on this lineage, it was surprising to find that the  xxxg1163xxx -/mice had no perturbation of platelet numbers (fig. 1). there was no difference in platelet counts for
wild-type, heterozygous, or il- 11ra-l- mice. these findings were also reflected in the bone marrow
and spleen. shown in figure 2 are representative histology sections from sternum and spleen of wildtype and il-llra-/- mice. there was no difference in the number of megakaryocytes nor in the
composition of other hematopoietic lineages. also, no difference was noted in the number of
megakaryocyte progenitors [22].this is in contrast to the situation in il-6null mice, which display a
normal platelet count but have an -50% reduction in megakaryocyte colony-forming cells (mk-cfc)
[sl]. the role of il-11in situations of hematopoietic stress was also examined. we have explored this in

to maintain erythropoiesis

[ s 2 ] ,  xxxg1162xxx  shows synergy
with scf in expanding
bfu-e potential of such
cultures at least four- to
fivefold 1531.  xxxg1162xxx  stimulates bfu-e when combined
with  xxxg1177xxx , even in the
absence of epo [s4,551

effect of il-1 1 on erythroid
progenitors was not abrogated by the addition of antibodies to scf,  xxxg1177xxx ,or gm-csf, thus suggesting a direct effect of  xxxg1162xxx 
on human and murine erythroid cells, at least in the in vitro system [ s s ] . studies in mice have
demonstrated that  xxxg1162xxx  can stimulate erythroid progenitors (bfu-e, cfu-e) and that this potential is
further amplified by concurrent administration with scf [57,.58]. the effect of il-11alone on the erythroid compartment also translates to a dose-dependent increase in reticulocytes [%i. in contrast to the

'

57

stimulatory activity of  xxxg1162xxx  on erythroid cells,  xxxg1162xxx  induced a mild anemia in mice [58].such an
effect is also seen in dogs [43], monkeys [42], and humans [45], and is thought to be due to volume
expansion [59].
despite the evidence implicating  xxxg1162xxx  in erythropoiesis, in the  xxxg1163xxx -/- mice, the hematocrit
and reticulocyte count as well as the numbers of erythroid progenitors were all normal (fig. i ) [ 2 2 ] .
in keeping with these results, the il-6 null mice also show a normal hematocrit (but with expansion
of erythroid progenitors) but exhibit a 100% mortality in response to hemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine. a similar experiment was performed in the il-l1ra-/- mice; however, their response was
completely normal. this was true both in terms of the degree of hemolysis produced using the same
dose as was lethal in the il-6 null mice and of the kinetics of erythroid recovery. therefore,
although  xxxg1162xxx  can influence multiple stages of erythroid development,  xxxg1162xxx  signaling in the adult
is not critical for maintaining basal erythropoiesis nor in generating a normal erythroid response to
hemolytic stress.

 xxxg1162xxx  and myelopoiesis
several investigators have shown that  xxxg1162xxx  shows little activity in stimulating myeloid
colonies in in vitro cell cultures but enhances the growth of a range of multipotential and
committed myeloid progenitors (mix-cfc, granulocyte-macrophage [gmi-cfc, m-cfc) in
combination with other growth factors such as  xxxg1177xxx , scf, gm-csf [52, 60-651, il-4 [61, 661,  xxxg1183xxx ,
il-12 [67-691, il-13 [66j,  xxxg801xxx -ligand [70],and tpo [71]. the expansion of myeloid progenitors
and peripheral blood neutrophilia is also seen with in vivo administration [42, 57, 721. however,
a neutrophilic response is not consistently seen in all experimental models. for example, mice in
which il- 11 expression was enforced showed >20-fold elevation in myeloid progenitors but had
unchanged leukocyte levels [40]. similarly, neutrophilia was not noted in dog studies [43] nor in
a human phase i trial [45].
the analysis of the myeloid compartment revealed no abnormality in the il-llra-/- mice.
there were normal neutrophil numbers, and there was no perturbation in myeloid progenitors as
ascertained by in vitro assays [22]. the analysis of hematopoietic progenitors was also extended to
a study of their capacity for self-generation. clone-transfer experiments were performed that
involved the physical isolation of individual colonies supported by scf and the replating of these
cells in secondary cultures also stimulated by scf. shown in table 1 are results for colonies
recloned from both wild-type and il- i ira-/- mice. there was no deficit in the recloning potential
from il-1 1ra-/- mice.

 xxxg1162xxx  and stemcells
w l e there is convincing evidence for the expansion of committed progenitors by  xxxg1162xxx , the activity of
this growth factor on the primitive stem cell population remains unresolved. addition of  xxxg1162xxx  to human and
murine long-term marrow cultures has been observed to increase the nonadherent cell population which contained increased numbers of multilineage and committed progenitors such as colony-forming unit-spleen
(cfu-s) day 12, mix-cfc, gm-cfc, and brt-e [52,73]. the proliferative effects have been shown to be
due to the entry of a quiescent (go)population into active cell cycle as well as the shortening of cell cycle time
[64,74]. however,  xxxg1162xxx  had no significant effect on the high-proliferative potential (hpp)-cfc and, in fact,
decreased the frequency of human long-term culture-initiating cells (ltc-ic) and murine long-term reconstituting stem cells [73]. similar results were demonstrated in short-term (six days) liquid cultures of bone
marrow cells taken two days after treatment with 5-fw. cells cultured with  xxxg1162xxx  as the sole stimulus were
incapable of generating primitive day 28 cobblestone area-forming cells (cafc) and did not contain stem
cells capable of competitive repopulation [75]. these results implied that  xxxg1162xxx  enhanced the commitment of
stem cells into a multipotential progenitor compartment. similarly, holyoake et a\. described a 50-fold amplification of multipotential progenitors after shor-term (six days) culture of unfractionated bm cells with scf
and  xxxg1162xxx  [76]. the ex vivo expanded cell population contributed to an accelerated short-term engraftment
and also sustained quartenary bone marrow transplant recipients as opposed to unmanipulated marrow [76].
despite an amplification of hpp-cfc and lpp-cfc with induction of active cell cycling, other workers have
described a defect in the engraftment potential of  xxxg1162xxx -treated cells [77,78]. a direct comparison, however,
cannot be made between these transplantation studies since they differed in experimental design. moreover, it
is difficult to attribute either the expansion or attenuation of long-term reconstitution capacity to e-11, since
it was only one component of differing cytokine combinations. in models of chronic  xxxg1162xxx  overexposure, bone
marrow cells overexpressing  xxxg1162xxx  resulted in accelerated engraftment of tertiary recipients [39, 411.
therefore, continued exposure of stem cells to il-1 1 did not lead to stem cell extinguishment.  xxxg1162xxx  also acts
to cause mobilization of stem cells/progenitor cells into peripheral blood [79].
results to date suggest, as with the other hematopoietic compartments, that the stem cell compartment is probably also preserved intact in the  xxxg1163xxx -/- mice. levels of cfu-s day 12 were normal;
however, the definitive assay for stem cell function is hematopoietic reconstitution. these results should
be contrasted with those for the lif null and the il-6 null mice. the lif-/- mice have an -60% and
-90% decrease in bone marrow and spleen cfu-s day 12 content, respectively, as well as a reduction in
gm-cfc and erythroid progenitors [so]. the il-64- mice also showed a reduction in cfu-s day 12 as

well as in long-term reconstitution potential [51]. this implies a progenitor/stem cell subset that is critically
dependent on lif or il-6. such a cell population has not yet been identified for  xxxg1162xxx . the overall physiological significance of this defect in the lif null or il-6 null mice is unclear, however, since despite reduced
levels of cfu-s, the lif null and the il-6 null mice have normal numbers of peripheral blood leucocytes.
we have also analyzed the role of  xxxg1162xxx  signaling in earlier stages of hematopoiesis. experiments were
performed using fetal livers and yolk sac tissue. an rt-pcr-based assay was used to determine the genotype
and examine gene expression in these tissues. as shown in the figure 3 upper panel, lanes 5 and 6 represent
fetal liver cells from il-l1ra-/- as they lack expression of exons 10-12 which were deleted by the targeting
strategy. for comparison, lanes 3,4, and 7 are from heterozygous pups. a transcript for il-11ra2 was never
identified in hematopoietic cells (middle panel), an observation in common with hematopoietic cells from
adult animals. similarly, no expression of the 11-11ra2 gene was detected in day 9.5 yolk sac tissues and
embryos (fig. 4). expression of il-1 1ra gene was present in wild-type yolk sac tissues and embryos and also
in those mutant for the scl gene [81] (included as a further control; fig. 4), but as expected, was not seen in
 xxxg1163xxx -/- tissues (data not shown).
the progenitor cell content of fetal livers and yolk sacs from mutant and wild-type mice was assessed
by in vitro clonal cultures. these assays were scored by an investigator blinded as to the genotype of the cells
being examined. as shown in figure 5, the numbers of gm-cfc, bfu-e, and mk-cfc in fetal livers from
mutant and control (il-1 1ra+/-) mice were comparable. gm-cfc and bfu-e progenitors were also quantified from yolk sacs. this involved dissecting the individual yolk sacs, preparing a single-cell suspension,
and stimulating the cells with the cytokine combination indicated. again, the number of progenitor cells was
similar for the two genotypes.

 xxxg1162xxx  and lymphopoiesis
in common with its effect on hematopoietic progenitors,  xxxg1162xxx  supports the generation of
lymphoid progenitors only in the presence of other cytokines. for example, in combination with il-4
or scf,  xxxg1162xxx  enhanced the generation of b cells in primary cultures of bone marrow cells [69, 82-84]
and together with  xxxg1183xxx ,  xxxg801xxx -ligand, or scf,  xxxg1162xxx  stimulated the growth of uncommitted progenitors
and their differentiation into the b lineage [70, 85-87]. the action of  xxxg1162xxx  in promoting b-cell differentiation (increased dna synthesis, immunoglobulin secretion, and augmentation of sheep red
blood cell-specific antibody responses) was found to be dependent on the presence of accessory t cells
but independent of coproduction of il-6 [ l , 88, 891. our results have shown that the production of
immunoglobulin isotypes as well as the production of specific antibodies after primary and secondary
antigen challenge was maintained in the il-i lra-/- mice [22].however, since the predominant action

of il-i 1 in this compartment is in combination with other growth factors, a phenotype may be
revealed in genetic crosses with mice lacking other molecules operative in this lineage.

lackof hematopoietic

is notdueto compensation
by il-11ra2
given the overwhelming body of data implicating  xxxg1162xxx  in stem cell regulation, thrombopoiesis,
erythropoiesis, and myeloid cell differentiation, the lack of hematopoietic phenotype in the il-llra-/mice was very surprising. explanations for a lack of a detectable effect on the hematopoietic compartment
included the possible failure to generate a germline il- 11ra null phenotype and/or compensation from
the untargeted il- 11ra2 gene. experiments were therefore performed to directly exclude these possibilities. first, southern analysis confirmed the desired mutation of the  xxxg1163xxx  locus. second, northern
analysis demonstrated an absence of il-1 1ra (and il-11ra2) transcripts, and this was confirmed by rtpcr on bone marrow cells and on colonies derived from those cells [22]. moreover, bone marrow cells
from il-1 ira-/- mice did not respond to  xxxg1162xxx  in in vitro cultures, while bone marrow cells from wildtype mice responded normally [22]. we have also confirmed the inability of il-1 1ra-/- mice to respond
to administered il- 11. as shown in table 2, in vivo administration of il-1 i caused the expected -1.5-fold
increment in platelet count in the wild-type mice. such a response was not observed in the  xxxg1163xxx -/mice. no consistent changes in either the white cell count or hematocrit were noted in either genotype.
these experiments documented both the inability to respond to  xxxg1162xxx  and the lack of compensation from
the il- 11ra2 gene.

 xxxg1162xxx (genetics institute) was administered s.c.at 250 pglkglday in 200 p1 of normal saline (ns)io,l% bsa, in two
divided doses for six days. controls were injected with nsibsa. platelet count was measured before and after stimulus
administration.
the increment in platelet count following il-ii administration was significant for only the wild-type (il-i 1ratlt) mice
('p = 0.02).

conclusion
the study of murine models made genetically deficient in growth factors or their cognate receptors
has provided important insights into the in vivo role of these molecules. for example, analysis of phenotypes resulting from targeted mutation of tpo [31] or its receptor  xxxg1442xxx  [32, 341, or the mutation of
gm-csf [90, 911 and its signal transduction molecule, the common p subunit [92, 931 have provided
complementary data regarding the role of these ligands and their receptors. our results imply that
although  xxxg1162xxx  exhibits multiple actions in the hematopoietic compartment, these are well compensated in the mice with a targeted mutation of the receptor. is this because of the untargeted second gene or
due to expression of an as-yet-unidentified receptor component? both possibilities seem unlikely since
the mutant mice have been shown to be unable to respond to  xxxg1162xxx  in vitro as well as in vivo. the
hematopoiesis-stimulating activity of  xxxg1162xxx , identified in in vitro and in vivo studies, has been tested in various models of myelosuppression: bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, irradiation, and
combined chemotherapy and irradiation [7]. the favorable effect of il-1 1 on hematopoietic recovery, observed in various animal models, has led to its evaluation in several human clinical trials. an
attenuation of post-chemotherapy thrombocytopenia and a reduction in platelet transfusion requirements has been observed, as well as an acceleration of the recovery of neutrophils when combined
with granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  [45, 46, 94-96]. thus, although hematopoiesis is undisturbed in mice lacking the il- 11 receptor, this does not detract from the potential clinical utility of
 xxxg1162xxx . the targeting study has, however, served to highlight the degree of redundancy that operates
within the hematopoietic system.
il-1 1 also has pleiotropic effects outside the hematopoietic compartment. our receptor targeting strategy
has also served to identify an additional role for  xxxg1162xxx  as a critically important mediator in reproductive
physiology, since the  xxxg1163xxx -/- female mice are infertile [22,97]. another potentially important role for

role of  xxxg1162xxx  in hematopoiesis

this growth factor is its enhancement of gastrointestinal epithelial repair after cytotoxic insult and in
inflammatory bowel disease. the combination of this action and its ability to stimulate thrombopoiesis
suggests an application in the context of cytotoxic therapy with deleterious effects on both organs; thus,
 xxxg1162xxx  is an exciting growth factor whose contribution to normal development and potential therapeutic
uses is beginning to be unraveled.
