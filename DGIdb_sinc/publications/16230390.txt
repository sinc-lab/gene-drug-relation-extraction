abstract
environmental and occupational exposure to arsenite is
associated with an increased risk of human cancers, including
skin, urinary bladder, and respiratory tract cancers. although
much evidence suggests that alterations in cell cycle machinery are implicated in the carcinogenic effect of arsenite, the
molecular mechanisms underlying the cell cycle alterations
are largely unknown. in the present study, we observed that
exposure of human keratinocyte hacat cells to arsenite
resulted in the promotion of cell cycle progression, especially
g1-s transition. further studies found that arsenite exposure
was able to induce  xxxg366xxx  expression. the induction of
 xxxg366xxx  by arsenite required nuclear factor-kb ( xxxg1559xxx )
activation, because the inhibition of ikb phosphorylation by
overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant,  xxxg1159xxx -km,
impaired arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression and g1-s
transition. the requirement of ikb kinase b ( xxxg1159xxx ) for cyclin
d1 induction was further confirmed by the findings that
arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression was totally blocked in
 xxxg1159xxx  knockout ( xxxg1159xxx  / ) mouse embryo fibroblasts. in
addition, knockdown of  xxxg366xxx  expression using cyclin
d1–specific small interference rna significantly blocked
arsenite-induced cell cycle progression in hacat cells. taken
together, our results show that arsenite-induced cell cycle
from g1 to s phase transition is through  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx /cyclin
d1–dependent pathway. (cancer res 2005; 65(20): 9287-93)

introduction
arsenite (trivalent arsenic, as3+) is introduced into the
environment during energy production based on coal, oil shale,
and geothermal sources. available epidemiologic data have shown
that exposure to arsenite is associated with increased risks of
human cancer of the skin, respiratory tract, hematopoietic system,
and urinary bladder (1–4). many cases of skin cancer have been
documented in people exposed to arsenite through medical or
other occupational exposures (5). based on these facts, the iarc
(1980 and 1987) and the u.s. environmental protection agency
(1988) classified inorganic arsenic as a human carcinogen.

several hypotheses have been proposed to describe the
mechanisms of arsenite-induced carcinogenesis in the previous
studies (6–12). it has been suggested that arsenic induces
chromosome aberration and sister chromatid exchange may be
involved in arsenite-induced carcinogenesis (9, 10). zhao et al.
(11) reported that arsenic may act as a carcinogen by inducing
dna hypomethylation, which in turn facilitates aberrant gene
expression. however, more and more evidence indicates that the
effect of arsenite on modulating the signaling pathways and genes
expression responsible for cell cycle machinery may play a more
important role in the carcinogenesis than classic genotoxic and
mutagenic mechanisms, which are believed to be associated with
the carcinogenesis of other metals such as cadmium or chromium
(13, 14).
it is widely accepted that alterations of gene expression that
drive uncontrolled cell cycle progression are requisite events
during tumorigenesis (15–17).  xxxg366xxx , acting as a sensor in
response to extracellular changes, can be induced by growth
factors and stress (18–20). aberrant  xxxg366xxx  expression has been
observed early in carcinogenesis (21–23), and overexpression of
 xxxg366xxx  was reported in several human cancers, including uterine
cervix (24), ovary (25), breast (26), urinary bladder (27), endometrium (28), and skin (29) cancers. moreover, antisense to  xxxg366xxx 
was reported to inhibit the growth and tumorigenicity of human
colon cancer cells and induce apoptosis in human squamous
carcinomas (30, 31). rossman et al. reported that exposure of
human fibroblasts to arsenite results in the induction of  xxxg366xxx 
expression (32). nonetheless, the effect of arsenite on cell cycle
progression remains obscure. because human skin is a major target
of arsenite, it would be interesting to know whether  xxxg366xxx  is
induced by arsenite in human keratinocytes. if it is, what are the
signaling pathways responsible for this induction and what are
their roles in alternations of cell cycles caused by arsenite
exposure? consequently, we here addressed these questions in
human keratinocyte hacat cells.

materials and methods
cell culture and reagents. human keratinocytic hacat cells and their
stable transfectants, wild-type (wt) and inb kinase h (ikkh)–deficient
(ikkh / ) mouse embryo fibroblasts were cultured in monolayers at 37jc,
5% co2 using dmem containing 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 2 mmol/l
l-glutamine, and 25 ag of gentamicin/ml. the cultures were detached with
trypsin and transferred to new 75-cm2 culture flasks (fisher, pittsburgh, pa)
from one to three times per week. fbs was purchased from life
technologies, inc. (gaithersburg, md); dmem was from calbiochem (san
diego, ca); luciferase assay substrate was from promega (madison, wi).
as3+ was purchased from aldrich (milwaukee, wi). the  xxxg366xxx  promoterdriven luciferase reporter ( xxxg366xxx  luc) was from dr. anil rustgi
(gastroenterology division, university of pennsylvania, philadelphia, pa).

cancer research
 xxxg366xxx  promoter-driven luciferase reporter was constructed by inserting
a 1.23-kb ecori-pvuii fragment of the  xxxg366xxx  gene promoter, which
contains the  xxxg366xxx  promoter sequence from 1,095 to 135 relative to
the translation initiation site, into the pa3luc vector as described
previously (33). the dominant-negative mutant of ikkh (ikkh-km) was a
gift from dr. hiroyasu nakano (juntendo university, japan), as described in
previous reports (34–36).
cell cycle analysis. hacat cells and their stable transfectants (2  105)
were cultured in each well of six-well plates to 70% to 80% confluence
with normal culture medium. the cell culture medium was replaced with
0.1% fbs dmem with 2 mmol/l l-glutamine and 25 ag gentamicin and
cultured for 24 hours. the cells were harvested and fixed with 3 ml of icecold 80% ethanol overnight. the fixed cells was then centrifuged (3,000
rpm, 3 minutes), suspended in lysis buffer (100 mmol/l sodium citrate
and 0.1% triton x-100), and incubated for 15 minutes at room
temperature. then the cells were incubated with  xxxg1963xxx  (10 mg/ml;
sigma chemical, st. louis, mo) for 10 minutes at room temperature; dna
was stained with  xxxd3027xxx  (50 ag/ml) for at least 1 hour at 4jc.
the dna content was determined by flow cytometry (beckman coulter,
san diego, ca) and expo 32 software.
 xxxg366xxx  small interference rna construction. the specific small
interference rna (sirna)–targeted human  xxxg366xxx  was designed with
sirna converter on the web site of ambion, inc. (austin, tx) according to
the gene sequence in genbank and guideline of sirna and synthesized by
invitrogen, inc. (san diego, ca). the target sequence was 5v-gttcatttccaatccgccc-3v(bases 791-809 of nm053056.1). the sirna sequence was
controlled via blast search and did not show any homology to other
known human genes. the sirna was inserted into psuppressor vector and
verified by dna sequencing.
stable transfection. hacat cells were transfected with  xxxg366xxx  luc,
nuclear factor-nb (nf-nb)-luciferase reporter, kkh-km, sicyclin d1,
or vector control plasmids according to the manual of lipofectamine
2000 reagent. briefly, hacat cells were cultured in a six-well plate to
85% to 90% confluence. five micrograms of plasmid dna alone or in
combination with cmv-neo vector for cotransfection were mixed with
10 al of lipofectamine 2000 reagent and used to transfect each well in
the absence of serum. after 6 to 8 hours, the medium was replaced with
10% fbs dmem. approximately 30 to 36 hours after the beginning of the
transfection, the cells were trypsinized with 0.033% trypsin, and cell
suspensions were plated onto 75-cm2 culture flasks and cultured for 24
to 28 days with  xxxg418xxx  selection (800 ag/ml). stable transfectant was

established and cultured in  xxxg418xxx -free dmem for at least two passages
before each experiment.
gene reporter assay. confluent monolayers of hacat  xxxg366xxx  luc
mass1 and hacat nf-nb luc mass1 cells were trypsinized, and 8  103
viable cells suspended in 100 al dmem supplemented with 10% fbs were
added to each well of 96-well plates. the plates were incubated at 37jc in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2. after the cell density reached 80% to
90%, the cell culture medium was replaced with an equal volume of
dmem supplemented with 0.1% fbs and 2 mmol/l l-glutamine. twelve
hours later, cells were exposed to arsenite for  xxxg366xxx  or nf-nb
induction. after 12-hour culture, the cells were lysed with 50 al of lysis
buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured using promega luciferase
assay reagent with a luminometer (wallac 1420 victor2 multipliable
counter system). the results are expressed as  xxxg366xxx  induction (relative
 xxxg366xxx  induction) or nf-nb activity (relative nf-nb activity) relative to
medium control (37).
phosphorylation assay for ikb kinase b and  xxxg1561xxx . hacat cells and
hacat-ikkh-km cells (2  105) were cultured in each well of six-well plates
to 70% to 80% confluence with normal culture medium. the cell culture
medium was replaced with 0.1% fbs dmem with 2 mmol/l l-glutamine
and 25 ag of gentamicin and incubated for 45 hours. cells were incubated
in serum-free dmem for 3 hours at 37jc and then exposed to arsenite for
the time as indicated in the figure legends. after exposure to arsenite,
the cells were washed once with ice-cold pbs and then extracted with
sds sample buffer. the cell extracts were quantified with a detergentcompatible (dc) protein assay kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca), separated on
polyacrylamide-sds gels, transferred, and probed with one of the
antibodies, including rabbit p- xxxg463xxx /h,  xxxg463xxx , ikkh, inba, and p-inba.
the  xxxg463xxx /h and inba protein bands specifically bound to primary
antibodies were detected using an anti-rabbit igg alkaline phosphatase–
linked secondary antibody and an ecf western blotting system
(amersham, piscataway, nj; ref. 38).
 xxxg366xxx  expression assay. hacat cells and their transfectants, wt
and ikkh / mouse embryo fibroblasts (2  105), were cultured in each
well of six-well plates to 80% confluence. after exposure to arsenite for
different times as indicated in the figure legends, the cells were washed
once with ice-cold pbs and then extracted with sds sample buffer. the cell
extracts were quantified with a dc protein assay kit (bio-rad), separated on
polyacrylamide-sds gels, transferred, and probed with rabbit-specific
antibody against  xxxg366xxx . the protein band specifically bound to the
primary antibody was detected as mentioned above.

results
cell cycle progression induced by arsenite in hacat cells.
to analyze the effects of arsenite on cell cycle, we exposed subconfluent hacat cells to 0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 amol/l of arsenite for
24 and 48 hours. as shown in table 1 and fig. 1, exposure of cells
to arsenite resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in the
proportion of cells in s phase and g2-m phase. the highest
proportion of cells in the s and g2-m phases was 40.11% and 28.49%,
respectively, which occurred after 48 hours of 5 amol/l arsenite
treatment. this increase in the s phase may be due to the promotion
of g1-s phase transition rather than the blockage of s to g2-m phase
transition, because the proportion of cells in g2-m phase also
significantly increased after arsenite treatment. this data show that
arsenite exposure is able to promote the cell cycle transition from
g1 to s phase, and in turn, may lead to g2-m increase.
 xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite in hacat cells. it has been
reported that arsenite exposure was able to induce  xxxg366xxx 
expression in human fibroblasts (32). the above results showed
that arsenite treatment led to an increase in g1-s phase transition.
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of
arsenite on cell cycle progression, we first focused on the alteration
in  xxxg366xxx  expression, based on the knowledge that  xxxg366xxx 
plays a crucial role in controlling cell cycle progression from g0-g1 to
s phase and acts as a sensor for cell cycle machinery in response
to stress, cytokine, or growth factor signaling (18–20). the results
showed that exposure of hacat cells to arsenite resulted in a marked
increase in  xxxg366xxx , at both transcription and protein levels (fig. 2).

 xxxg366xxx  induction and g1-s phase transition by arsenite.
the level of  xxxg366xxx  protein is largely controlled by the rate of
 xxxg366xxx  gene transcription, which is regulated by multiple
transcription factors (39–43). the  xxxg366xxx  promoter region
includes multiple binding sites for nf-nb (39, 40), e2f/dp (41),
sp-1/sp-3 (42), activator protein (ap-1; ref. 43), signal transducers
and activators of transcription (44), and  xxxd1773xxx –responsive

d1 expression in a cell type– and stimulus-dependent manner
(39–45). our previous studies have shown that arsenite exposure is
able to activate nf-nb and ap-1 transcription in mouse epidermal
cl41 cells (46). to elucidate the signaling pathways leading to cyclin
d1 induction by arsenite in human hacat cells, we investigated the
potential role of nf-nb in the  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite,
because it is believed that nf-nb transactivation is associated
with arsenite-induced tumor promotion (47). nf-nb is bound to an
inhibitory protein, inba in an inactive form in most cells, and
composed of nf-nb p50 and rel a p65 subunits (48). in response to
stress, cytokine, or growth factor, inba is phosphorylated by  xxxg463xxx /
h and then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome,
enabling nuclear translocation and binding of p50/p65 to the
promoter region of target genes (49). thus, we measured the
phosphorylation of  xxxg463xxx /h and nfnb-dependent transactivation
activity after exposure of hacat cells to arsenite. the data

indicated that arsenite treatment resulted in obvious increases
in  xxxg463xxx /h phosphorylation and nfnb-dependent transactivation
(fig. 3a and b). to further unravel the potential role of ikk/nf-nb
pathway in  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite, we established stable
pcr-flag-ikkh-km-transfected hacat cells and verified the
expression of ikkh-km by western blot with specific antibody
against the flag (m2, sigma chemical) as previously described
(refs. 34–36; fig. 3c). we found that overexpression of ikkh-km
was able to inhibit inba degradation (fig. 3d). moreover, overexpression of ikkh-km dramatically reduced  xxxg366xxx  expression
induced by arsenite (fig. 3e). furthermore, impairment of  xxxg463xxx /hinba-nf-nb- xxxg366xxx  pathway subsequently resulted in inhibition of arsenite-induced alternations of cell cycle g1-s phase
transition (fig. 4a and b). strong direct evidence for involvement of
ikkh/nf-nb in arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression was further
provided by the studies using ikkh-deficient cells. as fig. 3f

 xxxg366xxx  induction through  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  pathway by arsenite

figure 4. overexpression of ikkh-km blocked arsenite-induced increased g1-s phase transition. hacat-vector control transfectant and hacat-ikkh-km mass1 cells
(2  105) were seeded into each well of a six-well plate and cultured with 10% fbs dmem at 37jc overnight. after being cultured in 0.1% fbs dmem for 24 hours,
the cells were exposed to 2.5 amol/l of arsenite for 24 hours and fixed and stained with  xxxd3027xxx  as described in materials and methods. the cell cycle
distribution was determined by flow cytometry. one representative data of three independent experiments.

indicated, both basal level and arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression was dramatically blocked in ikkh / mouse embryo fibroblasts. these results strongly indicate that the arsenite-induced
activation of  xxxg463xxx /h-inba-nf-nb pathway is essential for the
induction of  xxxg366xxx , and which in turn may cause the alteration of
cell cycle g1-s phase transition.
essential role of  xxxg366xxx  in arsenite-induced cell cycle
progression in hacat cells. to directly assess the role of  xxxg366xxx 
induction in arsenite-induced increase in g1-s transition, we established stable  xxxg366xxx  sirna-transfected hacat cells and verified the
silencing effect of the sirna. as shown in fig. 5a,  xxxg366xxx  sirna
was able to specifically knockdown not only the basal level of cyclin
d1 but also the arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression (fig. 5a). the
specificity for  xxxg366xxx  sirna on  xxxg366xxx  expression was verified
by the data that the sirna did not show any inhibitory effect on
 xxxg367xxx  expression (fig. 5a). more importantly, arsenite-induced
increase in the proportion of cells in the s phase was dramatically
inhibited in the stable  xxxg366xxx  sirna-transfected hacat cells
compared with that in vector control transfectant (fig. 5b and c).
these data showed that  xxxg366xxx  is at least a major player in
arsenite-induced increase in g1-s phase transition.

discussion
arsenite is a well-documented human skin carcinogen (3, 4).
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenite-induced
carcinogenesis are still largely unknown. growing evidence
indicates that cell cycle is regulated by oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, and cell cycle alterations occurred in the
response of cells to various carcinogens (50, 51), suggesting that
cell cycle regulation is implicated in carcinogenesis (52). normal
eukaryotic cells progress through a well-defined cell cycle
consisting of four distinct stages: g1, s, g2, and m. g1 and g2
phases are gaps installed into m-s phase and s-m transitions,
respectively. these gaps allow for the repair of dna damage and
replication errors. moreover, g1 is a period when many signals
intervene to influence cell fate (15). extracellular changes, such as
diverse metabolic, hypoxia, and stress, are integrated and
interpreted during this period. faulty g1 control, caused by
activation of many oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor
genes, plays a critical role in tumorigenesis (15).  xxxg366xxx  is one of
the key regulators of g1-s transition (28). inducible  xxxg366xxx  forms
a complex with  xxxg411xxx /6, which phosphorylates the retinoblastoma
tumor suppressor protein, helping to sequestrate its growth-

inhibitory effects and enabling e2f transcription factors to activate
genes required for entry into the dna synthetic phase (s) of the cell
division cycle. among the e2f-responsive genes are cyclin e and
 xxxg365xxx , which combine with and activate  xxxg410xxx  to facilitate s
phase entry and progression. in the present study, we showed that
exposure of human keratinocyte hacat cells to arsenite resulted
in the increase in the proportion of cells in s phase, which was
at least partially associated with  xxxg366xxx  induction. in addition,
the increase in proportion of cells in g2-m phase was also observed
after arsenite exposure, which may be a mere consequence of the
increase in the s phase. however, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the increase in g2-m phase was directly caused by arsenite
exposure. actually, it has been reported that arsenite is able to
arrest cell cycle at g2-m phase by down-regulation of  xxxg401xxx 
activity in the g2-m phase of the cell cycle through inducing
 xxxg401xxx  degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome pathways (53).
 xxxg366xxx , acting as a sensor in response to extracellular
changes, can be induced by growth factors and stress through
activation of various signaling pathways including ras/mitogenactivated protein kinases (mapk; refs. 54–56), phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (pi-3k)/akt (57, 58), ikk/nf-nb (39, 40, 57), and gsk3h/hcatenin (45, 59, 60). here, we showed that activation of ikkh/nf-nb
contributed to arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression. ikkh-km
almost totally blocked  xxxg366xxx  induction after exposure of hacat
cells to arsenite for 12 hours. the contribution of ikkh/nf-nb was
further confirmed by the findings that  xxxg366xxx  induction by
arsenite was impaired in ikkh / mouse embryo fibroblasts. however, arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression in ikkh-km-transfected
hacat cells was partially recovered when the cells were exposed to
arsenite for 48 hours, although the basal level of  xxxg366xxx  was still
obviously lower than that in the control cells. consistent with this
result, ikkh-km was able to impair g1-s transition when ikkh-kmtransfected hacat cells were exposed to arsenite for 24 hours but
only showing a slight effect at 48 hours after arsenite exposure (data
not shown). these results suggest that the effect of dominantnegative ikkh-km may be overcome after long-term exposure of
cells to arsenite, or there may be some other pathways involved in the
late phase of  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite. recently, we showed
that that arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression requires activation of
pi-3k/akt, because inhibition of pi-3k dramatically impairs  xxxg366xxx 
induction by arsenite in mouse epidermal cl41 cells.1 it has been

figure 5. essential role of  xxxg366xxx  induction in arsenite-induced alternations of cell cycle
progression. hacat-vector control transfectant and hacat- xxxg366xxx  sirna mass1 cells (2  105) were
seeded into each well of six-well plates and cultured in 10% fbs dmem at 37jc. when the cell
density reached 70% to 80%, the culture medium was replace with 0.1% fbs dmem. a, after being
cultured for 24 hours, the cells were exposed to 5 amol/l of arsenite for 24 hours. the cells were
washed once with ice-cold pbs and extracted with sds sample buffer. the cell extracts were
quantified with dc protein assay kit (bio-rad), separated on polyacrylamide-sds gels, transferred, and
probed with specific antibodies as indicated and the ecf western blotting system.  xxxg367xxx  was
used as a control to indicate the specificity of the effect of  xxxg366xxx  sirna on silencing  xxxg366xxx 
expression.  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx  ) was used as a protein loading control.
b and c, the cells were exposed to 5 amol/l of arsenite for 48 hours and were fixed and stained
with  xxxd3027xxx  as described in materials and methods. cell cycle distribution was determined by
flow cytometry. one representative data from three independent experiments.

shown that the downstream of pi-3k/akt cascade includes ikk/
nf-nb, mapk kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases/ap-1,
and gsk3h/h-catenin pathways (61). gsk3h has been reported to
play a very important role in the negative regulation of  xxxg366xxx 
level at both transcription and protein levels (53–55). it has been
shown that gsk3h can phosphorylate  xxxg366xxx  and thereby
facilitate its degradation (60, 62). in addition, gsk3h is able to
phosphorylate h-catenin and retain it in the cytoplasm with
 xxxg170xxx . phosphorylation of gsk3h by akt
leads to its inactivation, and in turn, dephosphorylation of hcatenin, which enables its translocation into the nucleus and
activation of its target gene expression including  xxxg366xxx  (60).
actually, we have observed that h-catenin can be activated after
arsenite exposure.1 its role and the crosstalks among those
different signaling pathways in  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite
are currently being investigated in our laboratory.
in addition to the induction of  xxxg366xxx /prb, p21waf1-cyclin e
and arf-mdm2-p53 could also be involved in controlling g1-s
transition (16, 28). p21waf1 is a cyclin kinase inhibitor that induces
growth arrest by preventing phosphorylation of prb in the g1-s
transition, being able to silence cyclin-dependent kinases essential
for s-phase entry including cyclin e thus inhibiting cell cycle
progression. previous studies showed that exposure to arsenite
was able to induce p21waf1 expression, which was believed to
be implicated in growth arrest caused by a high dose of arsenite

(30, 63). nonetheless, the contribution of p21waf1 to the effect of
arsenite on cell cycle progression remains to be explored. the final
output may depend on the balance between  xxxg366xxx  and p21waf1.
p53 is a transcription factor that accumulates in response to dna
damage and other stress stimuli, negatively controlling g1-s transition by increasing the expression of p21waf1 protein (16, 28).
however, p53 may not be implicated in regulating arsenite-induced
cell cycle progression based on our findings that the p53dependent transcription activity was not activated after exposure
of cells to arsenite in cl41 cells (64) and hacat cells.1
in summary, our studies showed that exposure of human
keratinocyte hacat cells to arsenite leads to increased g1-s
transition by the induction of  xxxg366xxx  through activation of the
ikkh/nf-nb signaling pathway. in light of the key role of alterations
of cell cycle machineries in tumorigenesis, these findings will greatly
facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms involved in arsenite
skin carcinogenic effect.
