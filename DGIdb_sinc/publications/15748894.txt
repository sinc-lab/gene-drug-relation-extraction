abstract
organotypic cultures of embryonic mouse tooth germs were used to investigate the developmental expression and roles of mmps in the
formation and mineralization of dentin and enamel matrices. the spatially and temporally regulated expression of  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx  and
 xxxg1429xxx  in developing mouse tooth germs in vivo was maintained in culture. the inhibition of metalloproteinases activity by marimastat
altered the morphogenesis and mineralization of the tooth germs associated with an inhibition of the activation of both  xxxg1429xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx .
mmp inhibition deregulated the molecular processing of two major dental matrix proteins, amelogenin and dentin sialoprotein (dsp). this
coincided with their accumulation and the loss of their normal distribution within the extracellular matrix, resulting in a defective
mineralization of dentin and enamel matrices. these findings demonstrate the critical role of mmps in the processing and maturation of the
dental matrix.

introduction
matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) have been implicated in the physiological and pathological extracellular
remodelling of tissues and in invasive and migratory events
both in vivo and in culture. they have also been implicated in embryonic development and morphogenesis,
although fewer studies have addressed their roles in
tooth development. odontogenesis involves morphological
changes including spatial organization and tissue specific
differentiation, which requires the synthesis and organization of the extracellular matrix (ecm), which later
mineralizes. the dental crown is composed of enamel

and dentin consisting of proteins secreted by ameloblasts
and odontoblasts, respectively. these highly specialized
cells produce matrices which form a microenvironment that
triggers the deposition of hydroxyapatite (ha). forming
enamel is mainly composed of amelogenins, which account
for 90% of the enamel matrix. these low molecular weight
proteins, which are rapidly proteolytically processed, are
thought to regulate crystal growth and orientation [1,2].
the extracellular matrix of the dentin is composed of
collagen fibers and non-collagenous proteins (ncps) such
as the dentin sialoprotein (dsp) and dentin phosphoprotein
(dpp), both products of the same dentin sialophosphoprotein (dspp) gene which are involved in the regulation of
mineralization.
developing tooth tissues have previously been evaluated
for the expression of several mmps, but only a few of these
studies were concerned with dental matrix formation
occurring at the later stages of development [3,4]. in situ

hybridization and immunostaining revealed that  xxxg1428xxx  is
widely expressed in the dental mesenchyme and in the
basement membrane of mouse molar germs [5]. it was
suggested that  xxxg1428xxx  plays a role in basement membrane
degradation, thus allowing physical communication between
odontoblasts and ameloblasts. at a later stage of development, its expression in dental tissues was restricted to
differentiated odontoblasts while its main activator  xxxg1423xxx  was expressed on the cell surfaces of both ameloblasts and odontoblasts [6].  xxxg1440xxx , on the other hand, was
intensely and transiently expressed in the early dental
mesenchyme surrounding the invaginating tooth bud, but
its expression seems to diminish at the later stages [7,8].
immunohistochemical studies of the forming rat incisor also
revealed an uneven distribution of both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx , with the highest levels identified at the dentino–enamel
junction and coincided with the lowest level of timp-1 and
timp-2 [4].  xxxg1429xxx  cleaves amelogenin to produce
fragments commonly observed in vivo [9]. it may also
process other enamel proteins and is thought to regulate
enamel mineralization. it is mainly expressed in ameloblasts, but a transient expression was also found in
odontoblasts, although not in dentin [10]. in both ameloblasts and odontoblasts, the expression of amelogenin
preceded that of  xxxg1429xxx , suggesting a developmentally
controlled regulation [10,11]. these studies on the role of
mmps during the early stages of tooth development were
largely based on their pattern of expression and localization
and more direct evidence for their involvement and role in
the formation and mineralization of enamel and dentin
matrices is lacking. the use of mmps inhibitors in various
culture systems have helped to evaluate their role in cell
invasion, migration and development and contributed to our
appreciation of the possible roles they may play in vivo
[12,13]. developed by the british biotech pharmaceuticals,
marimastat ( xxxd2544xxx ) is one of the most studied mmp
inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical
studies. it is a collagen mimicking peptide with a hydroxamate group which inhibits mmp activity by chelating the
active site zinc ion and exhibits a potent inhibitory activity
towards a wide range of mmps [14,15].
in this study, we used as a model an organotypic culture
of embryonic mouse tooth germs to investigate the
developmental expression and implication of three mmps,
 xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1429xxx , at stages of terminal
morphogenesis and cell differentiation of tooth development. this model allows the visualization of the onset of
matrix apposition and early mineralization, which result in
the development of dentin and enamel after 10 days in
culture. these germ explants have the advantage of being
accessible to a targeted experimental perturbation. using the
broad spectrum mmp inhibitor marimastat, we demonstrate
an alteration of enamel and dentin formation, as well as an
inhibition of mineralization, associated with an inhibition of
the activation of both  xxxg1429xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx . we also
describe the consequences of this mmp deregulation on the

precise processing of two principal dental matrix proteins,
amelogenin and dentin sialoprotein, which may be considered as characteristics for amelogenesis and dentinogenesis,
respectively.

materials and methods
mice
timed pregnant swiss mice (charles river, lyon
france) were mated between 8 am and 10 am on day
0. mice with vaginal plugs were killed at the 18th day
of gestation by cervical dislocation, and the mandibular
first molar tooth germs were dissected from the embryos
under a stereo-microscope in cold hank’s buffer. they
were processed for protein extraction or explanted into
culture.
antibodies
the anti- xxxg1429xxx  polyclonal ab, developed in rabbit
and directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the
hinge region of the metalloproteinase, was from sigma (st.
louis, mo, usa). monoclonal antibodies for  xxxg1428xxx  (ca
801) and polyclonal antibodies for  xxxg1440xxx  were produced
in the laboratory of r. fridman [16,17]. polyclonal antibody
for dsp was kindly given by w.t. butler (university of
texas, houston, usa), and the polyclonal antibody for
amelogenin is a gift of biora (malmoe, sweden). antifibronectin polyclonal antibody was from chemicon international (temecula, ca). goat anti-mouse igg–peroxidase
conjugated and swine anti-rabbit igg-peroxidase conjugated
were from dako (glostrup, denmark).
germs explant culture
mandibular first molar tooth germs from e18 embryos
were cultured in semi-solid medium, bgjb (gibco-in
vitrogen, carlobad, ca, usa), supplemented with 20%
of fetal bovine serum (p pierce, rockford, il, usa), 20 mg/
ml l-glutamine, 275 ag/ml sodium ascorbate (merck kg
aa, darmstadt, germany) and an antibiotic solution (gibcoin vitrogen, carlobad, ca, usa) containing penicillin
(10.000 u/ml) and streptomycin (10 mg/ml) diluted to a
final concentration of 1% in an specific atmosphere rich in
oxygen (50% o2, 5% co2, 45% n2) at 378c. the medium
was filled with 0.5% agar (bacto agar, difcolab, detroit,
mi, usa) and changed at 2, 4 and 7 days. the cultures were
stopped at day 10, when the control germs form a 15- to 25am-thick dentin layer and an aprismatic enamel layer about
5 am thick [18]. these measurements were carried out on
micrographs of sections observed with the light microscope,
after correction for the magnification used. for time course
experiments, cultures were also stopped at 2, 4 and 6 days.
for the mmp inhibition experiments, a stock solution of

1 mm of metalloproteinase inhibitor, marimastat (british
biotechnology, oxford, uk), was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso). working dilutions of the inhibitor and
comparable dmso controls were made in the culture
medium. marimastat was added at day 2 at four different
concentrations: 0.2, 1, 2 and 10 am. all experiments were
done at least 3 times with about 10 tooth germs for each
treatment. after 10 days in culture, control and treated
germs were either frozen at 208c for biochemical analysis
(protein content, western blot, zymography) or fixed with
paraformaldehyde 4% buffered with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate for 3–4 h for the immunohistochemical studies. after
fixation and washing, the germs were dehydrated in a
graded series of ethanol, cleared in toluene and embedded
in paraplast plus (shewood medical co., st. louis, mo,
usa). for subsequent staining or immunochemistry, 4–5 am
thick sections were dewaxed in toluene and rehydrated.
serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or
submitted to von kossa reaction to reveal mineralization.
immunohistochemistry
sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched with 2% hydrogen
peroxide in methanol for 30 min. background activity
was blocked with 1% bsa in pbs at 48c overnight.
sections were immunostained with antibodies against
 xxxg1428xxx  (2 ag/ml),  xxxg1440xxx  (5 ag/ml),  xxxg1429xxx  (10 ag/
ml), dsp (5 ag/ml) and amelogenin (5 ag/ml) for 2 h at
room temperature. sections were rinsed with pbs-bsa 1%
and incubated for 2 h at room temperature and in the dark
with 1/100 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse igg for  xxxg1428xxx  and 1/100 dilution of peroxidaseconjugated swine anti-rabbit igg for  xxxg1440xxx ,  xxxg1429xxx ,
dsp and amelogenin. sections were rinsed again in pbs
and incubated with a diaminobenzamidine reagent and
h2o2. the specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by
western blot analysis. control experiments were carried out
by either omitting or substituting the primary antisera with
non-immune serum.
western blot analysis
tooth germs dissected from 4 day old mice were
homogenized using a potter homogenizer in an ice-cold
extraction buffer (10 germs in 150 al buffer: 50 mm tris–
hcl, ph 7.5, containing 5 mm cacl2, 0.9% nacl and 0.2%
triton x-100), supplemented with 1/100 protease inhibitor
cocktail set v edta free (calbiochem, la jolla, ca,
usa), which contains  xxxd502xxx , aprotinin, e-64 and leupeptin. the resulting homogenate was then briefly sonicated on
ice (3 times 5 s), cleared by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000g for
15 min at 48c and analyzed for the presence of  xxxg1429xxx ,
amelogenin, dsp and fibronectin. for immunoblot analysis,
20 ag proteins was subjected to laemmli 12% sds-page
and transblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, after which

the membranes were stained with ponceau-rouge to control
protein loading and transfer. after blocking, the membranes
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either antimmp-20 antibody at 1 ag/ml, anti-dsp at 0.25 ag/ml, antiamelogenin at 0.25 ag/ml or anti fibronectin at 1 ag/ml. the
membranes were then washed and incubated with a 1/2000
dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit igg
for 2 h at room temperature. signal was detected by means
of the renaissance western blot chemiluminescence
reagent plus kit from nen life science (boston, ma,
usa).
gel zymography
proteinase activity in the germ extracts described above
was analyzed by gelatin-zymography in 12% sds-polyacryamide gels copolymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin.
extracts (5 ag) were mixed with laemmli sample buffer
without reducing agents and without heating and were
subjected to sds-page. after electrophoresis, the gels
were incubated (30 min at 228c) in a renaturing solution
(2.5% triton x-100), rinsed briefly in distilled water and
incubated (24 h at 378c) in a developing buffer (50 mm
tris–hcl, ph 7.5, containing 5 mm cacl2 and 0.02%
nan3). the gels were then stained with 0.1% coomassie
blue r-250 in a solution of 20% isopropanol and 10%
acetic acid and destained in 20% isopropanol and 10%
acetic acid to reveal gelatinolytic activity.
electron microscopy
control and treated germs cultured for 10 days were
immersed in the fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde (taab aldermasston,
berks, england), buffered with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate
ph 7.2–7.4 for 3 h at 48c, then rinsed overnight in 0.2 m
cacodylate buffer. after postfixation in 2% oso4 (carlo
erba, milano, italy) and dehydration in graded ethanols, the
tooth germs were embedded in epon (fluka chemie, buchs,
switzerland). ultrathin sections were stained with aqueous
uranyl acetate for 5 min and then with lead citrate for 1 min.
they were examined with a jeol 100b transmission electron
microscope operating at 80 kv.
evaluation of apoptosis
apoptotic cell death was evaluated using the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase for nick end labeling (tunel)
method using a tdt-fragel kit (calbiochem, darmstadt,
germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the
slides were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in graded
series of ethanol. tissues were washed in tris buffered
saline (tbs) and then treated with proteinase k for 20 min
at room temperature; excess liquid was carefully blotted.
tissues were treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase at 378c for 1.5 h in a humid chamber. the specimens

496

were covered with stop buffer for 5 min at room temperature
and rinsed with tbs. to visualize labelling, a diaminobenzidine (dab) solution was added to the slides and incubated
for 15 min. after being washed with pbs, the slides were
counterstained with methyl green.

enzymatic digestion

mandibular tooth germs obtained from e18 embryos
developed in the culture, with a similar timing and pattern of
odontogenesis to that previously reported in vivo [21,22].
after 10 days culture (e18 + 10), the tooth germs increased
their size and protein content approximately two-fold and
secreted a thin layer of dentin, which reached 20 to 40 am in
thickness at the tip of the highest cusp (fig. 1). this dentin
(d) layer was easily distinguishable from the predentin (pd)
and from the 5 to 10 am thick layer of inner enamel (e),
which appeared at the sixth day of culture. a more detailed
time course (not shown) identified the 6th day in culture as a
key moment of matrix maturation in vitro, as it also
coincided with the mineralization of the dentin matrix. this
stage is comparable to that of tooth germs dissected out
approximately 2 days after birth.
we then compared, using immunohistochemistry, the
expression and distribution of three mmps,  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1429xxx , in the tooth germs removed from e18
embryos, from postnatal 7 day old (p7) mice and in e18
germs after 10 days culture (e18 + 10). these studies have
shown that the expression pattern of these proteinases in
vivo was maintained during differentiation in culture
(fig. 2).  xxxg1428xxx , weak in e18 germs (fig. 2a), increased
with dentin and enamel formation, both in vivo (fig. 2b)

tooth germs dissected from a 4 day old mice were
homogenized in the ice-cold extraction buffer (as described
above for cultured germs in the western blot section),
supplemented with the edta-free protease inhibitor cocktail and subjected to in vitro enzyme digestion. recombinant  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  [19] were first incubated with
1 mm apma ( p-aminophenylmercuric acetate) (sigma, st.
louis, mo, usa) for 1 h at room temperature to achieve
activation, after which activation was verified by zymography. activated  xxxg1428xxx  (1 ag/ml) or  xxxg1440xxx  (2 ag/ml)
was added to a 100 ag of extract in a final volume of 100 al
of 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  ph 7.5 containing 5 mm cacl2, 0.1 m
nacl and 0.05% triton x-100. the amounts of recombinant
enzymes added were determined from the zymography
analysis to give similar gelatine degrading activity. following 1, 3 and 18 h incubation periods at 378c, aliquots
containing 20 ag were subjected to sds-page analysis,
followed by western blot, to reveal dsp and amelogenin
degradation products. fibronectin, a known substrate for
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  [20], was used as a control for their
enzymatic activity by blotting the 18 h digestion products
against fibronectin antibody.

removed from e18 embryonic mice and (b, e, h ) from 7 day old mice (postnatal or p7). panels (c, f, i ) e18 tooth germs cultured for 10 days (e18 + 10). the
weak  xxxg1428xxx  staining at e18 (a) was increased after birth (b) and after culture (e18 + 10) (c) and was localized mainly in the ameloblasts, odontoblasts and
the underlying layers, with the strongest staining at the apical poles and processes of ameloblasts and odontoblasts. dentin and enamel are negative.  xxxg1440xxx 
staining at e18 (d) appears diffused, with some localized cellular staining noted in the preameloblasts and preodontoblasts. after birth (e) and after culture (f),
staining decreased and can be noted mainly at the apical poles of ameloblasts concentrated staining of  xxxg1440xxx  can also be observed at the tip of the cusps at
p7.  xxxg1429xxx  staining in e18 (g) can be observed mainly in the preameloblasts and odontoblasts, while after birth (h) and after culture (i), it is more distinct in
the enamel and ameloblasts. ameloblast (a), dentin (d), enamel (e), odontoblasts (od), pulp (p).

and in culture (fig. 2c), and concentrated in the odontoblasts and ameloblasts, particularly in the distal cell bodies.
a diffused signal was also found in pulp cells and the
enamel organ.  xxxg1440xxx  staining was initially diffuse (e18,
fig. 2d), and a global decrease in staining was consistently
observed in both p7 and e18 + 10, with the emergence of a
more specific and localized pattern of expression. this is
particularly noted in p7, where concentrated staining of
 xxxg1440xxx  can be observed at the tip of the cusps, the so-called
enamel-free zones. while at e18,  xxxg1440xxx  staining concentrated in preodontoblasts, preameloblasts and in mesenchymal papilla (fig. 2d); in p7 (fig. 2e) and in e18 + 10
(fig. 2f) germs, signal was confined to the apical cell
bodies and processes of odontoblasts and ameloblasts.
 xxxg1429xxx  staining, relatively weak at e18 (fig. 2g), was
increased in both p7 (fig. 2h) and in e18 + 10 (fig. 2i),
primarily in the ameloblasts and enamel. some staining was
also noted in the presecretory odontoblasts, in particular in
the cultured tooth germs. overall, mmp expression pattern

during tooth development appeared to be maintained during
differentiation in culture.
gelatin zymography, for the visualization of  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  (fig. 3a), and western blot for  xxxg1429xxx  (fig. 3b)
were performed on the explants removed at different days in
culture in order to correlate mmp activity with the different
stages of development.  xxxg1428xxx  was the major gelatinase,
and its level, as well as the ratio of the active (60 kda) to
latent form (72 kda), increased gradually up to day 6 in
culture, which corresponded by immunohistochemistry to
the stage of matrix mineralization. at day 10, the level of
 xxxg1428xxx  decreased (fig. 3a), suggesting a slowdown of
matrix turnover and maturation. however, this decrease in
 xxxg1428xxx  at day 10, which does not correspond to the
immunohistochemical results, may also be related to the
difficulty to extract the enzyme after the maturation and
mineralizating of the tissue reached at this stage, in
particular under the mild conditions used for extraction.
 xxxg1440xxx  was present mostly in the latent form and was little

and 10. cultured germs were homogenized and proteins were extracted in

regulated up to day 6, after which it was decreased and was
no longer detected at day 10 (fig. 3a).  xxxg1429xxx  also
increased during development to reach the highest level at
day 6 in culture. it appeared as a double band at
approximately 54 kda, with an additional faint band at
21 kda, corresponding to the previously described active
form of  xxxg1429xxx  [23,24] (fig. 3b). we are not sure of the
significance of this double band form at 54 kda, but the
possibility that it may result from the particular culture
conditions cannot be excluded, as it is less evident in the
uncultured germ (day 0). however, the existence of various
molecular forms of active  xxxg1429xxx  with different enzymatic
activity has been previously reported, and the in vitro
activation of bovine recombinant  xxxg1429xxx  yielded a
number of fragments varying in size from 55 to 18 kda,
with the 21 kda fragment exhibiting the highest activity
[25]. therefore, the lower mr form at approximately 50 kda
may also represent an intermediate activated form of mouse
 xxxg1429xxx . taken together, these results suggest that day 6 in
culture, which appears to represent a critical moment in
matrix maturation (fig. 1), also corresponds to the highest
mmp expression and activity.
marimastat alters tooth germs development and
mineralization
tooth germs were treated with 0.2, 1 and 2 am of the
broad spectrum mmp inhibitor marimastat from day 2 of
culture. fig. 4 shows that 2 am marimastat resulted in a
complete inhibition of enamel production and an absence of
mineralization of the dentin matrix, although the secretion of

predentin persisted, confirming our previous observations
comparing two different mmp inhibitors [26]. while enamel
production was inhibited both at 1 and 2 am, dentin was still
mineralized at 1 am (fig. 4b), although it appeared thinner
than in the control. no modification was evident in either
dentin or enamel at 0.2 am (data not shown). the inhibition
of mineralization in the presence of marimastat was
confirmed by von kossa reaction which specifically reveals
inorganic phosphate (figs. 4d–f). tunel analysis performed on treated germs revealed only minimal apoptosis in
the odontoblasts and ameloblasts (figs. 4g–i). a significant
number of apoptotic cells can be seen in the external
epithelium, a peripheral structure of the germ which is
destined to disappear with tooth maturation.
transmission electron microscopy (tem) of untreated
cultures revealed normal enamel structure, similar to that
described in dental tissue in vivo [27], showing needleshaped and fibrous structures (fig. 5a). the absence of
enamel matrix observed in the presence of marimastat was
confirmed by tem. this was associated with an accumulation of disorganized material in the ameloblasts and their
immediate periphery, more visible at 2 am marimastat,
similar to the stippled material previously described in
situations of altered secretion of enamel [27]. in the dentin
matrix, the mineralization front observed in control cultures
(fig. 5b) was no longer visible, but collagen fibers retained
their normal appearance, suggesting that collagen secretion
proceeded normally. however, at 2 am, but not at 1 am, the
typical gradient of collagen fibers normally found in this
matrix was not conserved (figs. 5c, d). in addition, the
matrix vesicles normally seen during mantle dentin formation, which are thought to represent mineral nucleation
sites, were not observed in the presence of marimastat.
germs incubated with 0.2 am marimastat have shown no
structural modifications in comparison to the control, while
10 am treated germs resembled those incubated with 2 am
(data not shown). these microscopic alterations are consistent with the defective mineralization observed in the
presence of marimastat. at all the concentrations of
marimastat studied, the subcellular structures appeared well
preserved with intact nuclear structure (fig. 5d).
marimastat inhibits the activation of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1429xxx 
gelatin zymography shows that the major effect of
marimastat was on the activation of  xxxg1428xxx  (fig. 3a). both
on day 6 and day 10, the ratio of the active form at 60 kda
to the latent form at 72 kda decreased significantly in the
presence of marimastat. the increase in  xxxg1440xxx  in the
presence of marimastat at day 6 may not be due to the inhibitory property of marimastat, as it was previously reported in different cell systems that marimastat increases
 xxxg1440xxx  expression [28]. the increase in prommp-2
production on day 10 in the presence of marimastat is
harder to explain, but it may represent a compensatory
response to the inhibition of degradation activity. western

fig. 4. dose response effects of the mmp inhibitor marimastat on the morphogenesis, mineralization and cell viability of cultured tooth germs. e18 tooth germs
were cultured for 10 days in the absence or presence of marimastat (1 or 2 am), which was added on day 2. hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrates a
total inhibition of enamel formation by marimastat (ma), while the inhibition of dentin was dose dependent, as a thin layer of dentin can still be visible at 1 am.
von kossa reaction targets phosphate ions and reveals areas of mineralization. a strong black precipitation (shown by *), which is seen in control untreated
germs (cont), diminishes in the presence of 1 am marimastat and is no longer seen at 2 am. apoptosis analysis by tunel staining shows that marimastat
increased the number of apoptotic cells but which remained relatively low and were mainly limited to cells in the periphery of the explant. very few apoptotic
cells are detected among ameloblasts and odontoblasts and no further increase of apoptotic cells could be noted after treatment with 10 am marimastat in either
ameloblasts, odontoblasts or the external epithelium (not shown). ameloblast (a), dentin (d), enamel (e), odontoblasts (od), pulp (p), predentin (pd).

blot analysis of  xxxg1429xxx  (fig. 3b) shows that the main
effect of marimastat is observed at day 6, with the
disappearance of the active form of 21 kda. this suggests
that the inhibition of the activation of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1429xxx 
may be, at least partially, responsible for the resultant effect
on the matrix.
mmp inhibition deregulates the processing of amelogenin
and dentin sialoprotein
amelogenin and dsp are considered the major proteins
of the enamel and dentin matrix, respectively. we sought to
investigate whether the inhibition of enamel and dentin
formation in the presence of marimastat were associated
with a modification in the spatial distribution of amelogenin
and dsp in the tissue. the immunohistochemical staining
shows that in untreated germs, both amelogenin and dsp
have a very defined localization pattern. the amelogenin is
localized primarily in the ameloblasts, enamel and in the
preodontoblasts (fig. 6a), while the dsp is restricted to

odontoblasts and pulpal horn (fig. 6e). when the germs
were treated with 1 am marimastat (added at the 2nd day of
culture), the staining of these proteins greatly increased and
their distribution was altered and diffused, as shown in
figs. 6 (b, f). this effect of marimastat progressed
gradually and can already be seen 2 days after marimastat
addition (e18 + 4; fig. 6c), with a particularly strong and
extended staining at e18 + 10 (fig. 6d; time course only
shown for amelogenin).
we then examined whether this altered distribution of
amelogenin and dsp was associated with a modification in
their molecular processing. western blot analysis of
identical amounts of germ extracts (20 ag) shows that
marimastat interfered with the processing of amelogenin
(fig. 7). in addition to the previously described multiple
forms of amelogenin, between 18 and 27 kda, we also
observed, in the control cultured germs, faint bands around
50 kda and 80 kda, which have been suggested to consist
of dimmers and trimmers of these forms [29]. marimastat
caused a major increase in these complexes, as well as in the

and dentin matrix with a characteristic mineralization front (b) can be seen. in germs cultured in the presence of 1 am marimastat, ma (c), the dentin matrix
show normal collagen fibers, with the typical concentration gradient being strongest near the ameloblasts, but no crystals can be seen along these fibers. enamel
is completely absent. at 2 am marimastat (d), the fibrillar structure of collagen in the dentin matrix is maintained but the concentration gradient is partially
lost. the absence of enamel coincides with a clear accumulation of granular disorganized material (arrow) near the secretory pole of the ameloblasts.

higher mr monomers, at 25 and 27kda forms, which
coincided with a decrease in the lower mr 23 and 24 kda
forms. this suggests that the lower mr forms derive from
mmp cleavage of the larger amelogenin monomers and
complexes.
the main effect of marimastat on dsp analyzed by
western blot is the increase in the 56 kda form, with no
apparent change seen in the higher mr 80 kda form. dsp is
a highly glycosylated protein which also contains several
phosphorylated serines. these posttranslational modifications, mainly glycosylation but possibly also phosphorylation, may account for the different molecular weight forms
observed. several higher molecular isoforms have been
previously described in mature rat incisor, which, upon
enzymatic deglycosylation, dropped to an mr of 56 kda
[30]. this may suggest that marimastat, by inhibiting mmp
activity, preferentially inhibits the degradation of this 56 kda
unglycosylated dsp form, resulting in its accumulation.
however, the possibility that these forms may represent a
different transcript of dsp should also be considered [31].
in any case, mmp inhibition caused an increase in the total
content of both dsp and amelogenin, consistent with the
immunostaining analysis.
although the cleavage of amelogenin by  xxxg1429xxx  has
been extensively studied [9,23,25,32,33], the proteolytic
degradation of dsp, which is an important regulator in
dentin mineralization [34], has not yet been described. the
intense expression of  xxxg1428xxx  in both dentin and enamel
during the development and the inhibition of its activation
by marimastat in our system prompted us to investigate

whether  xxxg1428xxx  can degrade dsp and amelogenin. to this
end, extracts of uncultured tooth germs dissected 4 days
after birth and whose matrix is still forming were treated
with either recombinant  xxxg1428xxx  or  xxxg1440xxx  for 1, 3 and
18 h, after which dsp and amelogenin or their cleavage
forms were revealed by western blot. the results in fig. 8
show that  xxxg1428xxx , but not  xxxg1440xxx , can degrade both dsp
and amelogenin. the zymogram in fig. 8c shows the
activation of both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  by apma (1 mm,
1 h at room temperature), revealed by the increase in the
activated forms of the enzymes (arrow). the activity of both
enzymes after apma treatment is further demonstrated in
fig. 8d, where fibronectin, known to be cleaved by  xxxg1428xxx 
and  xxxg1440xxx  [20], was degraded by both enzyme after 18 h,
showing a decrease in the high molecular form at 230 kda
and an increase in the degradation products at approximately 20 kda. the time course of the degradation in figs.
8a and b shows that the cleavage of amelogenin and dsp
by  xxxg1428xxx  was rapid and most had already been degraded
after 1 h. by contrast,  xxxg1440xxx  did not seem to efficiently
degrade either amelogenin or dsp. some degradation of
amelogenin by  xxxg1440xxx  can be noted at 18 h but which was
relatively minor compared to that observed with  xxxg1428xxx . a
slight increase in the dsp band at 56 kda can be noted after
1 or 3 h incubation with  xxxg1440xxx  but which was no longer
seen at 18 h. although we have no explanation for this
increase, it may be that  xxxg1440xxx  cleaves other proteins which
form complexes with dsp in the matrix, thus liberating
more of the soluble molecule. increasing  xxxg1440xxx  concentrations to 5 ag/ml had no further effect on either molecules.

fig. 6. effect of 1 am marimastat on amelogenin and dsp immunostaining in cultured tooth germs. (a) control germs cultured for 10 days (e18 + 10)
demonstrate a highly confined localization of amelogenin in the ameloblasts, enamel and odontoblasts. (b) marimastat treatment was started on day 2 of culture
and caused a major increase in amelogenin staining associated with an extended and diffused distribution. (c, d) the time course of marimastat effect shows
that the changes are progressive and gradual and can already be seen 2 days after marimastat addition (c; day e18 + 4), steadily increasing through day e18 + 6
(d), which represents 4 days of marimastat treatment. (e, f) dsp immunostaining in untreated germs was confined to odontoblasts and pulpal horn (e), and
after marimastat treatment, its distribution was extended to the ameloblasts and the periphery (f). (for abbreviations, see above legends.)

it is not clear why the molecular forms of dsp are
somewhat different from those seen in the western blot of
the cultured germ extracts (fig. 7) and where the higher mr
bands (n100 kda), described to be glycosylated isoforms of
dsp [30], were hardly detected. this may be related to the
fact that the dentin is not at the same stage of maturation in
both cases (e18 + 10 in fig. 7 vs. p4 in fig. 8), or it may be
that dsp undergoes different posttranslational modifications
under culture conditions. overall, these in vitro studies
show that  xxxg1428xxx  is able to degrade both amelogenin and
dsp and may contribute to the maturation of these proteins
during dentin and enamel formation.

discussion
the importance of mmps, in particular the  xxxg1429xxx 
( xxxg1429xxx ) and the gelatinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx ), in

tooth development has been largely suggested on the basis
of the pattern of the distribution and expression of these
proteases. these studies concerned more particularly cell
migration, differentiation and ecto–mesenchymal interactions occurring at the early stages of development, prior to
dental matrix formation. given the role of mmps in matrix
degradation and remodelling, we focused, in this study, on
the role of these proteases in the establishment and
maturation of the two principal mineralized matrix making
the dental tissue, dentin and enamel. using an in vitro organ
culture of embryonic tooth germs, treated with the broad
spectrum hydroxamic acid mmp inhibitor marimastat, we
were able to confirm the direct role for mmps in the
formation of these matrices, as marimastat caused a total
inhibition of enamel synthesis and perturbed, in a dose
dependent manner, dentin mineralization [26]. these effects
were limited to the extracellular matrix, as the cells secreting
the matrix, ameloblasts and odontoblasts, were structurally

502

k. bourd-boittin et al. / experimental cell research 304 (2005) 493–505

role of the different molecular forms of dsp is not clear at
present, the fact that an increase in total dsp after
marimastat treatment was associated with an inhibition of
mineralization is consistent with these findings.

and dsp. tooth germs cultured for 10 days without (c) or with 1 am
marimastat (ma) were extracted in the presence of proteases inhibitors.
extracts containing 20 ag proteins were analyzed by western blotting with
amelogenin or dsp antibody. arrows correspond to mr of 27, 25, 24, 23,
21 and 18 kda.

well preserved, as demonstrated by transmission electron
microscopy, and undergone only minimal apoptosis even
at the higher marimastat concentrations. the absence of
enamel was associated with an accumulation of disorganized
material in the immediate vicinity of the ameloblasts, which
may correspond to the previously described stippled material,
shown to be accumulated in situations where the secretion
of enamel is genetically or chemically altered [27,35].
around the odontoblasts, however, collagen secretion and
fibrils formation appeared to proceed normally, although
in the mantle dentine, the matrix vesicles that constitute
initial nucleation sites were absent. these findings are
suggestive of a defective organization and mineralization of
the extracellular matrix when mmp activities are inhibited.
these alterations in the structural organization of the
pericellular matrix were associated with modifications at the
molecular level. amelogenin and dsp, the two major
proteins of the enamel and dentin matrix, respectively,
accumulated in the extracellular space following marimastat
treatment, with a concomitant loss of their highly confined
and organized localization. this was translated by biochemical modifications in the processing of both amelogenin and dsp. the main effect of mmp inhibition on dsp
appeared to be an increase in the 56 kda molecular form.
dsp, which is derived from dentin sialophosphoprotein
(dspp), has been suggested to be a nucleator and promoter
of crystal growth and is believed to play a crucial role in
dentin mineralization. consistent with that, dspp knockout
mouse was recently shown to develop defective dentin
mineralization [36]. the local concentrations of dsp have
been shown, in vitro, to be critical in mediating its effects, as
low concentrations (b25 ag/ml) of added dsp increased the
yield of hydroxyapatite (ha) formed, while at higher
concentrations (50–100 ag/ml), nucleation and crystal
growth were slightly inhibited [34]. although the specific

day old mice (p4) were extracted in the presence of edta-free protease
inhibitors cocktail. extracts were incubated with rmmp-2 (1 ag/ml) or
rmmp-9 (2 ag/ml) for 1, 3 and 18 h after prior to the activation of the
enzymes with 1 mm apma for 1 h at room temperature. the amounts of
recombinant enzymes added were determined from the zymography
analysis (c) to give similar gelatine degrading activity. twenty microgram
proteins was then subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies to
amelogenin or dsp to reveal cleavage (a, b). the extent of activation of
the recombinant gelatinases was verified by gelatin zymography, where 1 ng
rmmp-2 and 2 ng rmmp-9 were loaded to the gelatin gel before and after
apma treatment (c). the arrows indicate the activated forms. extracts
obtained after 18 h incubation with the activated enzymes were also
analyzed by blotting against anti-fibronectin antibodies as a positive control
for the gelatinases degrading activity (d). arrowheads denote the increase
in cleavage products with both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx .

while in dentine, the effect of mmps inhibition was
limited to the initiation of mineralization, the absence of
enamel appeared to result from a defect in the secretion and
organization of the matrix molecules. in this case, the
accumulation of the amelogenin aggregates, or stippled
material, seen by tem at the vicinity of ameloblasts as a
result of mmp inhibition, may be responsible for the
defective amelogenesis. this stippled material is thought
to derive from defective amelogenins which accumulate in
the ecm [27] or to represent poorly degraded enamel
proteins which cannot be reinternalized by the tubulovesicular system into ameloblasts [37]. at the molecular
level, marimastat was shown to interfere with the processing
of amelogenin, favoring the formation of high molecular
weight complexes. these complex forms have been previously described in situations where cleavage by  xxxg1429xxx 
was prevented by site directed mutagenesis at the trap site
of the amelogenin molecule [38]. furthermore, a mutation at
this site was identified in patients with amelogenesis
imperfecta, which present a defective enamel [38]. these
findings, together with ours, demonstrate the absolute
necessity for proteolytic processing of the amelogenin
complexes in order to establish a normal enamel matrix.
consistent with that is the correlation shown between the
degree of enamel matrix maturation and the size of the
amelogenin fragments it contained, with the smallest fragments found in the most mature enamel [39,40]. in this
context, mmp inhibition by marimastat increased not only
the complex forms but also the higher molecular weight
fragments, concomitant with the disappearance of certain of
the smallest forms, as was previously shown for  xxxg1429xxx 
knockout mouse [41], implicating  xxxg1429xxx  in processing
these small molecular weight fragments.
a detailed time course morphological analysis of the
cultured tooth germs have shown that day 6 in culture
corresponds to the onset of enamel secretion and dentin
mineralization and appears to represent a key step in matrix
maturation during in vitro development. it is interesting that
this point coincided with a peak in proteolytic activity,
particularly of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1429xxx .  xxxg1429xxx  can degrade
many of the extracellular matrix proteins [42], but its
cloning and isolation from the enamel organs and the fact
that it can degrade amelogenin suggest an important role
during the initial developmental stages of enamel [9,43].
however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. other
mmps have been identified in the developing tooth, such as
the gelatinases  xxxg1428xxx  and -9 [7],  xxxg1437xxx  ( xxxg1437xxx )
[44],  xxxg1439xxx  ( xxxg1439xxx ) [45] and  xxxg1423xxx  [6,46].
however, the localization of  xxxg1428xxx  in dentin [47] and the
high expression of  xxxg1428xxx  in differentiating and secretory
odontoblasts during dentin formation [3,7] suggest a prime
role in dentin formation. the inhibition observed in the
proenzyme activation of both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1429xxx  in the
presence of marimastat may therefore explain, at least
partially, the altered matrix formation and maturation caused
by this inhibitor. the stimulation of prommp-9 production

503

observed in the presence of marimastat was already
documented [28]. the reason for this is not clear, but since
marimastat did not affect the level of its activated form, this
upregulation of  xxxg1440xxx  by marimastat may be of little
biological consequence in our model. in addition,  xxxg1440xxx 
expression in the tooth germ was much lower than that of
 xxxg1428xxx . however, studies by tjaderhane et al. [48] have
shown that in odontoblasts,  xxxg1440xxx  can be upregulated by
tgfh, while having no effect on  xxxg1428xxx , suggesting that in
pathological conditions,  xxxg1440xxx  may have a more important
role.
while the cleavage of amelogenin by  xxxg1429xxx  has been
extensively studied, that of dsp has not yet been described.
our in vitro digestion experiments provide evidence that
recombinant  xxxg1428xxx  was able to effectively degrade dsp,
while, under the same conditions,  xxxg1440xxx  had no significant
effect, suggesting a possible role for this enzyme in the
processing of dsp.  xxxg1428xxx  also degraded most forms of
amelogenin, suggesting that  xxxg1428xxx  can also participate, in
concert with  xxxg1429xxx , to achieve a complete processing of
amelogenin. in this respect, the intense expression of  xxxg1428xxx  in the developing tooth, together with a specificity of
degradation against the major constituents of dental matrix,
suggest a potentially important role for this gelatinase in
ecm degradation necessary for the establishment, organization and maturation of the two mineralized matrices that
compose the dental tissue. based on its intense expression
and large distribution, a major role for  xxxg1428xxx  in the early
stage development of mandibular arch has been previously
suggested, but which mostly concerned early migration and
invasion events [13]. our study suggests that in addition to
 xxxg1429xxx ,  xxxg1428xxx  may also be important in the processing
of the dental matrix taking place at later stages. more direct
evidence for the specific role of  xxxg1428xxx  and the involvement of other mmps, such as  xxxg1418xxx  and  xxxg1439xxx , awaits
the development of more specific mmps inhibitors. such
tools will enable a more thorough mechanistic investigation
on the precise action of these mmps in the process of dental
matrix maturation.
