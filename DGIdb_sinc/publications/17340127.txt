abstract this study characterized the pharmacology of the
peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonists,  xxxd134xxx ,
its metabolite, adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx . the
activities of the compounds were investigated with respect to
human or guinea pig opioid receptor binding and function in
recombinant cell lines and mechanical responsiveness of the
guinea pig ileum.  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011 had higher
binding affinity than  xxxd2614xxx  at human mu opioid
receptors (pki values of 9.6, 9.6, and 8.0, respectively). the
compounds had different selectivities for the  xxxg1635xxx  over
human delta and guinea pig k opioid receptors. adl 08-0011
had the highest  xxxg1635xxx  selectivity. with respect to their mu
opioid receptor functional activity ([35s]gtpgs incorporation),  xxxd2614xxx  had a positive intrinsic activity,
consistent with partial agonism, unlike  xxxd134xxx  and adl
08-0011, which had negative intrinsic activities.  xxxd134xxx ,
adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx  antagonized inhibitory
responses mediated by the mu opioid agonist, endomorphin-1
(pa2 values of 9.6, 9.4, and 7.6, respectively) and by
u69593, a k opioid agonist (pa2 values of 8.4, 7.2, and
6.7, respectively). in morphine-naive guinea pig ileum,
 xxxd2614xxx  reduced, while  xxxd134xxx  and adl 080011 increased, the amplitude of electrically evoked contractions and spontaneous mechanical activity. in tissue from

morphine-dependent animals,  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011
increased spontaneous activity to a greater degree than
 xxxd2614xxx . the data suggested that alvimopaninduced contractions resulted predominantly from an interaction with k opioid receptors. it is concluded that
 xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx  differ in
their in vitro pharmacological properties, particularly with
respect to opioid receptor subtype selectivity and intrinsic
activity. the clinical significance of the data from this study
remains to be determined.

introduction
opioid analgesics such as morphine continue to play a critical
role in chronic malignant and nonmalignant pain control
(walsh 2000). despite their effectiveness, however, opioids
have significant drawbacks, notably the development of
analgesic tolerance and physical dependence, sedation,
respiratory depression, and bowel dysfunction (walsh
1990). opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (obd) is extremely common, affecting more than 50% of patients on chronic
morphine treatment for cancer pain and, unlike the majority
of opioid-induced effects, is not prone to tolerance (pappagallo
2001; vanegas et al. 1998). consisting of constipation,
delayed gastric emptying, abdominal discomfort, and nausea,
obd can be extremely debilitating in patients on chronic
opioid therapy (de luca and coupar 1996; kurz and sessler
2003; pappagallo 2001). the phenomenon of obd results
from an interaction of opioid agonist with receptors on enteric
neurons and smooth muscle to inhibit coordinated rhythmic
contractions associated with gastrointestinal transit and
secretion (de luca and coupar 1996). the ability of
prototypical  xxxg1635xxx  antagonists, such as naltrexone
and naloxone, to attenuate obd has been demonstrated
clinically. however, as these agents readily cross the blood
brain barrier, attenuation of opioid-induced analgesia and
provocation of an opioid behavioral withdrawal syndrome
can occur (culpepper-morgan et al. 1992; pappagallo 2001).
the susceptibility of naloxone to first pass metabolism in
humans may provide some gastrointestinal selectivity after
oral administration, but careful dose titration is required
(culpepper-morgan et al. 1992; meissner et al. 2000). to
circumvent this issue, two peripherally-restricted mu opioid
receptor antagonists,  xxxd134xxx  [(s)-2-benzyl-3-[(3r,4r)-4(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl]-propionylamino)] and  xxxd2614xxx , are under development for the
treatment of obd (foss 2001; yuan 2004).  xxxd2614xxx 
is a quaternary derivative of naltrexone; the addition of a
methyl group reduces cns penetration as a result of
increased polarity and lower lipid solubility (brown and
goldberg 1985). the peripheral selectivity of  xxxd134xxx  is
attributed to its moderately large molecular weight, zwitterionic form, and polarity (zimmerman et al. 1994). clinical
data suggest that these compounds are able to attenuate obd
and postsurgical ileus without affecting pain control (foss
2001; schmidt 2001; wolff et al. 2004; yuan 2004).
the availability of preclinical pharmacological data for
 xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx  is rather limited. the binding
affinities of  xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx  at human mu

opioid receptors (pki values of 9.1 and 7.6, respectively;
cassel et al. 2005; zimmerman et al. 1994) and their ability to
inhibit morphine-induced attenuation of electrically evoked
contractions of the guinea pig ileum (pa2/pkb values of 9.7 or
7.3, respectively; zimmerman et al. 1994; yuan et al. 1995)
have been reported. in vivo rodent studies indicate that
 xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx  inhibit morphine-induced
reductions in gastrointestinal transit (brown and goldberg
1985; zimmerman et al. 1994; greenwood-van meerveld et
al. 2004). attenuation of morphine-induced analgesia generally requires higher doses of  xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx ,
although data for the latter are complicated by demethylation
to the centrally penetrant metabolite, naltrexone, in rodents
(brown and goldberg 1985; kotake et al. 1989; zimmerman
et al. 1994). recently, it was revealed that  xxxd134xxx  has an
active metabolite, adl 08-0011 ((s)-2-benzyl-3-[(3r,4r)-4(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl]  xxxd3029xxx ), an amide hydrolysis product that is generated by human
gut microflora (foss et al. 2005). after oral dosing of
 xxxd134xxx  to healthy human subjects, the systemic exposure
of adl 08-0011 is up to tenfold higher than that of the parent
(camilleri 2005; foss et al. 2005; schmith et al. 2005).
pharmacological data on adl 08-0011 are lacking.
the objective of this study was to investigate the preclinical
in vitro pharmacological profiles of  xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011,
and  xxxd2614xxx . the activities of these opioid receptor
antagonists and standard opioid ligands for comparison were
investigated with respect to human or guinea pig opioid
receptor binding and function in recombinant cell lines and
effects on guinea pig isolated ileum, a preparation that has been
used widely in the study of opioid receptor pharmacology. as
 xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx  are likely to be prescribed to
individuals already exposed chronically to morphine, it was
considered important to investigate their activity in morphinedependent ileum in addition to morphine-naive preparations.
in the clinic,  xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx  are associated
with transient abdominal discomfort and cramping in patients
receiving chronic morphine or methadone therapy, effects
attributed to a gastrointestinal opioid withdrawal syndrome
(schmidt 2001; yuan et al. 1999). it was intended to assess
whether any such activity of  xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, or
 xxxd2614xxx  could be observed in the morphine-dependent guinea pig ileum.
preliminary data were presented at the digestive disease
week meeting, held in los angeles, may 2006.

grown in ham’s f12 media (gibco-invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca, usa) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs; hyclone, logan, ut, usa), 100 units ml −1
penicillin, 100 mug ml−1 streptomycin (gibco-invitrogen),
and 800 mug ml−1  xxxd2191xxx  (gibco-invitrogen) in a 5%
co2, humidified incubator at 37°c. receptor expression
levels (bmax ∼2.0 and ∼0.414 pmol mg−1 protein, respectively) were determined using [3h] xxxd1913xxx  (perkinelmer, boston, ma; specific activity of 50–55 ci mmol−1)
in a membrane radioligand binding assay.
cells were grown to 80–95% confluency (<25 subculture passages) in t225 flasks (corning, ny, usa). for cell
line passaging, the cell monolayer was incubated for 5 min
at 37°c in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; gibcoinvitrogen), supplemented with 5 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta; gibco-invitrogen) and harvested by
gentle mechanical agitation. after resuspension, cells were
transferred to 40-ml fresh growth media, centrifuged for
5 min at 1,000 rpm, and resuspended in fresh growth
medium at the appropriate split ratio.
for membrane preparation, cells were incubated for 5 min
at 37°c in 10 ml of pbs (gibco-invitrogen) supplemented
with 5 mm edta (gibco-invitrogen) and harvested by gentle
mechanical agitation, followed by centrifugation (2,500×g
for 5 min). the pellets were resuspended in assay buffer
[50 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid
n-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-n′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid)
(hepes); sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa] at ph 7.4
and homogenized with a polytron disrupter on ice. the
resultant homogenates were centrifuged (1,200×g for 5 min),
the pellets discarded, and the supernatant centrifuged
(40,000×g for 20 min). the pellets were washed once by
resuspension in assay buffer followed by an additional
centrifugation (40,000×g for 20 min). the final pellets were
resuspended in assay buffer (equivalent to one t-225 flask
ml−1 buffer). protein concentration was determined using a
bio-rad bradford protein assay kit (bio-rad laboratories,
hercules, ca, usa), and membranes were stored in frozen
aliquots at −80°c until required.
human  xxxg1632xxx  membranes were purchased
(perkin-elmer). the reported kd and bmax values for these
membranes, determined by saturation analysis in a [3h]
naltrindole radioligand binding assay, were 0.14 nm and
2.2 pmol mg−1 protein, respectively (perkin-elmer). protein
concentration was determined using a bio-rad bradford
protein assay kit (bio-rad laboratories). membranes were
stored in frozen aliquots at −80°c until required.
radioligand binding assays were performed in 96-well
polypropylene assay plates (corning) in a total assay volume
of 200 mul containing the appropriate amount of membrane
protein (approximately 3, 2, and 20 mug for mu, delta, and k opioid
receptors, respectively) in assay buffer supplemented with
0.025% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa). saturation-binding

studies for determination of pkd values of the radioligand
were performed using [3h] xxxd1913xxx  (0.001–5 nm).
displacement assays for determination of pki values of
compounds were performed with [3h] xxxd1913xxx  (0.5,
1.2, and 0.7 nm for mu, delta, and k opioid receptors,
respectively) and test compound (10 pm–100 mum).
binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression
analysis using prism™ (graphpad software, san diego,
ca) and the three-parameter model for one-site competition. the curve minimum was fixed to the value for
nonspecific binding, as determined in the presence of
10 mum naloxone. ki values for test compounds were
calculated using prism™, from the best fit ic50 values
and the kd value of the radioligand, using the cheng–
prusoff equation (cheng and prusoff 1973): ki =ic50/(1+
([l]/kd)) where [l]=the concentration of [3h] xxxd1913xxx . results were expressed as pki values.
functional activity at human recombinant mu and delta
and guinea pig k opioid receptors
[35s]gtpgs membrane binding assays were performed in 96well polypropylene assay plates (corning) in a final assay
volume of 200 mul. human mu and delta and guinea pig k opioid
receptor membranes were prepared as described above. for
each assay, 10 mug of mu, delta, or k membrane protein were
incubated in 50 mm hepes [ph 7.4, 10 mm mgcl2, either
25 mm (mu) or 100 mm nacl (delta and k), 10 mum guanosine
diphosphate (gdp), 0.1 nm [35s]gtpgs, 0.1% bsa, and the
appropriate ligand for 30 min at 23°c]. nonspecific binding
was defined using 10 mum gtpgs. the incubation was
terminated after 30 min by rapid filtration on packard gf-b
filter plates preblocked with 50 mul well−1 of 1% bsa
followed by three washes with 200 mul of ice-cold 50 mm
hepes using a packard filtermate harvester. plates were
allowed to dry overnight, and bound radioactivity was
determined by scintillation counting. [35s]gtpgs membrane
binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis
using prism™ (graphpad). pec50 values (mean and sem)
were generated from concentration–response curves using the
three-parameter model for one-site competition. intrinsic
activity (ia) and 95% confidence intervals were defined as
the % maximum response (minus basal) relative to that of the
full agonist (damgo ([d-ala2, n-me-phe4, gly5-ol]-enkephalin) for mu; u69593 ((+)-(5a,7a,8beta)-n-methyl-n-[7-(1pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]-benzeneacetamide) for
k; or dpdpe ([d-pen2,5]-enkephalin) for delta), which was run
in parallel on every plate.
guinea pig ileum functional studies
all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with
the principles of laboratory animal care provided by the

208

institutional animal care and usage committee of
theravance. adult male dunkin hartley guinea pigs (200–
300 g, harlan, ia, usa) were acclimatized to their holding
room (temperature controlled at 21±1°c and 12:12 h light–
dark cycle commencing  xxxd2274xxx  am) for at least 1 week after
arrival, before experimentation. tissues used in the in vitro
experiments were derived from naive guinea pigs or from
those treated chronically with either morphine or vehicle.
in some studies, osmotic minipumps (alzet, model
2ml1) were used to provide maintained exposure of
animals to morphine or its vehicle. guinea pigs were
anesthetized with isoflurane (4–5%) in an induction
chamber and anesthesia then maintained with isoflurane
(2–3%) via a nose cone. after shaving and cleansing with
betadine and 70% isopropanol, an incision was made in the
mid-scapular area, and an osmotic minipump was
implanted subcutaneously to provide chronic (7-day)
dosing of morphine (45 mg kg−1 day−1) or vehicle (5%
dextrose in distilled water; 10 mul h−1). an antibiotic
(baytril®; 2.3%) was applied to the incision site, which
was then closed with a 4-0 vicryl® suture (ethicon). the
animals were allowed to recover consciousness under a
heating lamp and then returned to their home cages.
guinea pigs were euthanized by co2 asphyxiation and
thoracotomy. segments of ileum (20 cm in length, 10–30 cm
caudal to the ileocecal junction) were removed and placed in
krebs–henseleit physiological buffer containing (in mm)
kcl (4.7), kh2po4 (1.2),  xxxd2534xxx  anhydrous (1.2), nacl
(118.1), d-glucose (11.1), nahco3 (25.0), cacl2 (2.6), and
indomethacin (0.001; to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis). the
ileum was flushed with krebs–henseleit solution using a
pipette and placed in a beaker containing fresh buffer.
segments of ileum (approximately 4 cm in length) were
mounted on stimulation electrode assemblies under a tension
of 1 g in a 10-ml tissue bath filled with krebs–henseleit
buffer. four preparations were used from each animal. the
bathing solution was aerated continuously with 95% o2/5%
co2 and maintained at 37°c. during the next 30 min, tissues
were washed twice (at 5 and 15 min after mounting) and
tension re-applied to 1 g as necessary throughout this period.
changes in isometric force were recorded by means of a
force transducer (world precision instruments, model fort
100), amplifier (astro med., model s48), and a data
acquisition system (biopac mp100, acknowledge™ waveform acquisition and analysis software).
in some experiments, segments of ileum were incubated for
18 h at 4°c with vehicle, morphine, or selective mu, k, or delta
opioid receptor agonists (i.e., damgo, u69593, or dpdpe,
respectively; 0.01–10 mum) before mounting in the tissue bath.
after mounting and for the remainder of the experiments, no
attempt was made to maintain exposure of tissues to the
agonists used in the 18-h incubation. on occasion, tissues
were treated (at room temperature) 1 h before the 18-h agonist

naunyn-schmiedeberg’s arch pharmacol (2007) 375:205–220

incubation, with  xxxd1793xxx -cys-tyr- xxxd1794xxx -arg-thr-pen-thr-nh2
(ctap; 0.1 mum), 5′-guanidinonaltrindole ( xxxg1402xxx ; 1 nm), or
( xxxd1424xxx ,8as,14br)-5,6,7,8,14,14b-hexahydro-7-(2-methyl-2propenyl)-4,8-methanobenzofuro[2,3-a] xxxd3047xxx [4,3-b]carbazole -1,8a(9h)-diol (sdm25n, 0.03 mum), selective mu, k, or delta
opioid receptor antagonists, respectively.
to establish their viability, all tissues were challenged
twice, at 30 and 60 min after mounting, with carbachol at a
concentration (1 mum) previously established to evoke a
maximal contractile response. once the contractions had
reached a maximum, tissues were washed five times every
2 min and once more, 10 min later. thirty minutes after the
second carbachol challenge, tissues were subjected to one
of three protocols.
(a) in some experiments, electrical field stimulation (efs) of
the preparations was initiated [10 v (a just-maximal
voltage), 1 ms pulse width, 0.1 hz frequency] using a
grass stimulator (model s88k) and a med-lab stimusplitter ii. cumulative concentration–response curves to
test compounds were constructed (concentrations increasing at half-log increments, typically from 0.1 nm to
10 mum). when no response was evident, at least 5 min
were allowed to lapse between drug challenges; otherwise, it was ensured that a maximum response had been
achieved before addition of the next, higher concentration. the potency, with respect to augmentation or
attenuation of the efs-evoked contractions, was analyzed
by iterative curve fitting to a logistic equation using
prism™ (graphpad). the equation used was:
y ¼ bottom
þ ðtopbottomþ=ð1þ10ððlogec50 x þslopeþþ;
where x is the logarithm of the drug concentration, and
y is the response (starting at the bottom of the curve and
going to the top with a sigmoid shape). the mean
potency (pec50 or pic50) and ia (i.e., maximum %
change of the efs-evoked contraction) were evaluated
in tissue from at least four guinea pigs.
(b) the antagonist activity of test compounds was
assessed in the following manner. after the two
carbachol challenges, efs was initiated (10 v, 1 ms,
0.1 hz), and a cumulative concentration–response
curve to the selective mu and k opioid receptor
agonists, endomorphin-1 and u69593, respectively,
was constructed (concentrations increasing at half-log
increments, from 0.1 or 1 nm to 10 mum). upon
completion of the concentration–response curve, efs
was terminated, and tissues were washed five times
every 2 min and once more, 10 min later. a further
10 min later, efs was re-initiated followed by the
addition of a single concentration of test compound or

naunyn-schmiedeberg’s arch pharmacol (2007) 375:205–220

vehicle, 10 min later. after a 15-min equilibration
period, the endomorphin-1 or u69593 concentration–
response curve was repeated. the concentration ratio
(with respect to the endomorphin-1 or u69593
concentration–effect curves in the absence and presence of test compound) was calculated and a pa2
value determined (arunlakshana and schild 1959).
(c) application of some of the test compounds (i.e.,
 xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011) to ileum isolated from
morphine-dependent guinea pigs resulted in large fluctuations in the spontaneous activity of the tissue making it
impossible to measure accurately their influence on the
efs-evoked responses. as a consequence, additional
experiments were performed in which the effects of test
compounds on resting activity of the ileum were
measured. tissues were exposed, in the absence of efs,
to drug vehicle [10 mul of either  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso) or sterile water] followed by a second challenge
of a single concentration of test compound (0.001–
10 mum) or vehicle. the spontaneous mechanical activity
was integrated (acknowledge™ waveform acquisition
and analysis software), and the contractile area during
the 15 min after challenge with the test compound (or its
vehicle) was expressed as a percentage change from that
recorded in the 15 min immediately preceding the
application.

materials
carbachol, indomethacin, damgo, morphine, nalorphine,
naloxone, and u69593 were purchased from sigma-aldrich.
ctap, dpdpe,  xxxg1402xxx , sdm25n, and snc 80 ([(+)-4-[(ar)a-((2s,5r)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-n,n-diethylbenzamide]) were purchased from tocris
cookson. baytril was purchased from bayer.  xxxd134xxx ,
adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx  were synthesized as
described previously (goldberg et al. 1979; werner et al.
1996). test compounds (10 mm) and serial dilutions were
prepared in either dmso or sterile water. in vivo doses of
morphine were expressed with respect to the free base
weight.

results
binding affinities of test compounds at human mu and delta,
and guinea pig k opioid receptors
the pki values of test compounds were determined after [3h]
 xxxd1913xxx  displacement in competitive binding assays
using membranes prepared from cho-k1 cells transfected

209

with either human mu or delta opioid receptors or guinea pig k
opioid receptors. with the exception of the selective k and delta
opioid receptor antagonists,  xxxg1402xxx  and sdm25n respectively,
a  xxxg1635xxx -selective panel of compounds was tested
(table 1).  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011 demonstrated ≥
tenfold higher selectivity for the human  xxxg1635xxx 
over human delta and guinea pig k opioid receptors, with pki
values (mean±sd, n≥3) of 9.6±0.1, 8.6±0.2, and 8.3±0.01
for  xxxd134xxx  and 9.6±0.2, 7.8±0.1, and 7.5±0.1 for adl
08-0011, respectively (fig. 1). in contrast, relative to
 xxxd134xxx , the mu/k  xxxd2614xxx  selectivity was threefold, with pki values of 8.0±0.1, 6.2±0.1, and 7.5±0.1 for
the human mu, delta, and guinea pig k opioid receptors,
respectively (fig. 1). naloxone demonstrated a similar
selectivity profile to  xxxd2614xxx  but had higher affinity
for the human mu, delta, and guinea pig k opioid receptors with
pki values of 9.2±0.1, 7.9±0.1, and 8.7±0.1, respectively.
the rank order of affinities at human recombinant mu opioid
receptors was  xxxd134xxx  = adl 08-0011 = naloxone >
nalorphine >  xxxd2614xxx  = morphine > damgo =
endomorphin-1. at human delta opioid receptors, the only
difference in the rank order from that at the  xxxg1635xxx 
was that  xxxd134xxx  had a higher affinity than adl 08-0011.
the rank order of affinities at the guinea pig k opioid receptor
was naloxone >  xxxd134xxx  = nalorphine > adl 08-0011=
 xxxd2614xxx  > morphine > damgo > endomorphin-1.

values at the human recombinant mu and delta opioid receptors
of −5 and −14%, respectively, while the values for adl
08-0011 were −6 and −26%, respectively. at the guinea pig
k opioid receptor, the ia values of  xxxd134xxx  and adl 080011 were 4 and 6%, respectively. the ia values of
 xxxd2614xxx  were 10 and 12% at the mu and k opioid
receptor, respectively and 0% at the  xxxg1632xxx . in
comparison, the ia values for naloxone were 2, −11, and 7%
at the mu, delta, and k opioid receptors, respectively. with respect
to the other opioid ligands tested, morphine induced the
maximum degree of agonist activity at the  xxxg1635xxx 
(pec50 and ia values of 7.7 and 115%, respectively) relative
to the damgo control (pec50 =8.1), followed by endomorphin-1 (pec50 =7.2 and ia=99%) and nalorphine
(pec50 =8.4 and ia=33%). damgo (ias=57 and 26%),
morphine (ias=58 and 34%), nalorphine (ias=26 and
38%), and endomorphin-1 (ias=13 and 15%) demonstrated
weak partial agonist activity at delta and k opioid receptors,
respectively. the selective antagonists, ctap, sdm25n,
and  xxxg1402xxx , had no agonist activity at the mu, delta, and k opioid
receptors (data not shown).

influence of compounds on efs-evoked responses
cumulative addition of drug vehicle to the guinea pig ileum
had no effect on the amplitude of the efs-evoked
contractions. of the standard mu opioid ligands used in the
study, morphine, endomorphin-1, damgo, nalorphine
and, to a lesser extent, naloxone (each at 1 nm-10 mum)
produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the efsevoked responses (fig. 2a; table 3). the rank order of
potency was damgo (mean pic50 =8.0) = endomorphin-1
(mean pic50 =8.0) > nalorphine (mean pic50 =7.5) =
naloxone (mean pic50 =7.5) = morphine (mean pic50 =

table 3). u69593 (1 nm–10 mum; n=4), a selective k opioid
receptor agonist (lahti et al. 1985), produced a concentration-dependent attenuation of the efs responses (mean

of 8.0, 7.5, or 6.7, respectively; table 3). the mean ia of
 xxxd2614xxx , with respect to attenuation of the efsmediated contractile amplitude, was −28%, intermediate in
value to that of nalorphine and naloxone (table 3). the
mean ia values of  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011, with
regard to augmentation of the responses, were 18 and 20%,
respectively (table 3).
the ileum isolated from morphine-dependent guinea pigs
responded to efs with a contraction, which was significantly
larger in amplitude (p<0.05, student’s t test) compared to that
recorded in tissue from morphine-naive animals [mean
responses (±sem) of 3.3±0.1 and 2.3±0.1 g, respectively
(n=38)]. in other respects, the efs-evoked contractions in
morphine-dependent ileum appeared similar to those in tissue
from naive animals. after 7-day treatment of guinea pigs with
morphine, the ileum responded to morphine, damgo,
nalorphine, and u69593 (each at 1 nm–10 mum) with a
concentration-dependent inhibition of the efs-evoked contractions, with mean (±sem) pic50 values of 6.7±0.1 (n=6),
7.0±0.1 (n=3), 6.6±0.1 (n=4), and 8.1±0.2 (n=6), respectively (fig. 2c). the mean ia values (with 95% confidence
intervals) of morphine, damgo, nalorphine, and u69593
were −61% (−55, −67), −60% (−56, −65), −38% (−32, −43)
and −66% (−55, −77), respectively (fig. 2c). in comparison to
the naive tissue data (fig. 2a,b; table 3), there was a rightward
shift in the morphine, damgo, and nalorphine concentration–response curves after chronic morphine treatment and an
accompanying reduction in the ia of nalorphine (from −67 to
−38%). the u69593 concentration–response curve appeared
unaffected by chronic morphine treatment. naloxone and
 xxxd2614xxx  (both at 1 nm–10 mum), which attenuated the
efs-evoked responses in naive tissue (fig. 2a,b; table 3) had
little effect on the contractile amplitude in ileum isolated from
morphine-dependent guinea pigs (fig. 2c). after application of

increases in spontaneous mechanical activity. to allow a
comparison of the activities of  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011
to be made in morphine-dependent tissue, an alternative
approach had to be taken. the effects of test compounds on
the spontaneous mechanical activity of the ileum, rather than
efs-evoked responses, were determined (see below).
antagonism of agonist-mediated attenuation of efs-evoked
responses
the  xxxg1635xxx  antagonist potencies of naloxone,
 xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx  were
determined by investigating their ability to inhibit the
endomorphin-1-mediated inhibition of efs-evoked contractions. vehicle challenge had no effect on successive
endomorphin-1 concentration–response curves. concentration-dependent rightward shifts in the agonist concentration–response curve were produced by  xxxd134xxx , adl
08-0011,  xxxd2614xxx  (fig. 4), and naloxone. the rank
order of antagonist potency was  xxxd134xxx  (pa2 =9.6) ≥
adl 08-0011 (pa2 =9.4) = naloxone (pa2 =9.4) >  xxxd2614xxx  (pa2 =7.6). the slopes of the schild plots
(fig. 5) for  xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, naloxone, and
 xxxd2614xxx  were not statistically significantly different from unity. at 300 nm,  xxxd134xxx , but not adl 080011, was associated with an apparent insurmountable
antagonism of endomorphin-1 (fig. 4).
the k opioid receptor antagonist potencies of  xxxd134xxx ,
adl 08-0011,  xxxd2614xxx  (fig. 6), naloxone, and
 xxxg1402xxx , a selective k opioid receptor antagonist, were

produced by each compound, but not by vehicle. the

naloxone (pa2 =8.5) =  xxxd134xxx  (pa2 =8.4) > adl 08-0011
(pa2 =7.2) >  xxxd2614xxx  (pa2 =6.7). the slope of each
schild plot was not statistically significantly different from
unity [values (with 95% confidence intervals) for  xxxd134xxx ,
adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx : 0.97 (0.44–1.50), 1.36
(0.44–2.28), and 1.21 (0.79–1.63), respectively].
influence of opioid ligands on the spontaneous activity
of morphine-naive and morphine-treated ileum
in tissues isolated from guinea pigs treated subcutaneously
for 7 days with morphine vehicle (d5w, 0.24 ml day−1),
application of vehicle (10 mul of either dmso or sterile
water) to the tissue bath had no effect on contractile activity.
 xxxd2614xxx , naloxone, and nalorphine (each at 1
nm–10 mum) reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner,
spontaneous mechanical activity of the guinea pig ileum
(p<0.05, anova, followed by a dunnett’s post-hoc test vs
vehicle), while  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011 (both at 1
nm–10 mum) were associated with statistically significant
increases (fig. 7a). the mean pec50 values of  xxxd134xxx 
and adl 08-0011 were 8.1 and 6.9, respectively, and the
mean pic50 values of  xxxd2614xxx  and nalorphine were
5.9 and 8.2, respectively. an accurate pec50 value for
naloxone could not be calculated.

also more robust at these incubation parameters, although
 xxxd134xxx -mediated excitation was noted at all incubation
conditions tested provided contractile responses to carbachol
were present.  xxxd134xxx  (0.1 mum) was associated with a
marked increase in contractile activity in tissues preincubated with u69593 (0.01–1 mum), a selective k opioid
receptor agonist (fig. 9a). after pre-incubation of the ileum
with a high concentration of u69593 (i.e., 10 mum), the
enhanced activity of  xxxd134xxx  was abolished (fig. 9a), an
observation that was attributed to an inability to wash
u69593 from the k opioid receptors. after pre-incubation
of the ileum with damgo (0.01–10 mum) or dpdpe (0.1–
10 mum), selective mu or  xxxg1632xxx  agonists,
respectively,  xxxd134xxx  increased spontaneous activity
modestly to a similar extent as that observed with vehicle
pretreatment (fig. 9a). the addition of the selective
k opioid receptor antagonist,  xxxg1402xxx  (0.3–10 nm), to the
incubation medium 1 h before u69593 application
[0.1 mum, i.e. a maximal concentration (fig. 9a)] produced
a concentration-dependent inhibition of the  xxxd134xxx 
(0.1 mum)-induced contractile response (fig. 9b). treatment
of the ileum with  xxxg1402xxx  (1 nm) 1 h before morphine
application (10 mum), inhibited the  xxxd134xxx  (0.1 mum)induced contractile response (fig. 9c). incubation with the
selective mu and  xxxg1632xxx  antagonists, ctap
(0.1 mum) or sdm25n (0.03 mum), respectively, was
associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the  xxxd134xxx 
(0.1 mum)-mediated responses (fig. 9c).

in addition to experimentation with tissue isolated from
morphine-treated guinea pigs, in some studies, naive ileum
was incubated in vitro with morphine before testing.
 xxxd134xxx  (0.1–10 mum), but not its vehicle, was associated
with a concentration-dependent increase in spontaneous
contractile activity of ileum that had been incubated for
18 h at 4°c with morphine. before selecting these incubation
conditions, ileum was incubated for 1, 4, 18 and 24 h, at 4°c,
room temperature and 37°c. tissue viability, assessed by the
magnitude of responses to carbachol application, suggested
that 18-h incubation at 4°c was optimal. a limited number of
observations suggested that the effects of  xxxd134xxx  were

despite the widespread use and acknowledged benefit of mu
opioid receptor agonists in chronic pain therapy, obd
causes significant morbidity in sufferers (pappagallo 2001;
vanegas et al. 1998). the potential utility of a peripherally
restricted  xxxg1635xxx  antagonist to counteract obd
without interfering with pain control has been validated
clinically (foss 2001; paulson et al. 2005; schmidt 2001;
yuan et al. 2000). this study investigated the in vitro
profiles of  xxxd134xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx , two peripherally restricted  xxxg1635xxx  antagonists, which are
currently in development together with adl 08-0011, the
active metabolite of the former. based on the similar mu
opioid receptor binding affinities of  xxxd134xxx  and adl
08-0011 and the higher systemic exposure of the metabolite
after oral dosing of the parent (camilleri 2005; foss et al.
2005; schmith et al. 2005), adl 08-0011 may be
responsible for much of the clinical efficacy attributed to
 xxxd134xxx .
the relevance, if any, of the differences in mu/kappa opioid
receptor selectivities observed for  xxxd134xxx , adl 080011, and  xxxd2614xxx  is unclear. although radio-

ligand binding and functional experiments utilized guinea
pig k receptors, this species is used widely as a surrogate
for human k (knapp et al. 1995). as morphine and other
commonly used opioid analgesics are mu preferring, antagonism of the  xxxg1635xxx  presumably plays the dominant role
in the efficacy of  xxxd134xxx  (or its active metabolite, adl
08-0011) and  xxxd2614xxx  in obd patients. the mu
opioid receptor antagonist potencies of  xxxd134xxx , adl
08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx , with respect to inhibition
of endomorphin-1-mediated attenuation of the efs-evoked
contractions of the guinea pig ileum, correlated with the mu
opioid receptor binding data, consistent with the acknowledged role of the  xxxg1635xxx  in this tissue and with
the high  xxxg1635xxx  selectivity of endomorphin-1
(tonini et al. 1998; zadina et al. 1997). interestingly, at
300 nm,  xxxd134xxx , but not adl 08-0011, exhibited
apparent insurmountable antagonism of the endomorphin1 response. further investigation has revealed that high

concentrations of  xxxd134xxx  require more prolonged
washing in comparison to adl 08-0011 for its removal
from mu opioid receptors in the guinea pig ileum. the
k opioid receptor antagonist potencies of  xxxd134xxx  and
adl 08-0011 in attenuating u69593-mediated inhibition of
efs-evoked contractions correlated with their binding
affinities at guinea pig recombinant k receptors.  xxxd2614xxx  had a lower k opioid receptor antagonist potency
than would have been anticipated from its binding affinity
at this subtype. the reason for this discrepancy is unclear,
although it is considered unlikely that it reflects a problem
with tissue access, as there was close correspondence
between the  xxxg1635xxx  pki and pa2 values of
 xxxd2614xxx .
the abilities of  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011 to reduce
basal [35s]gtpgs binding at human recombinant mu and delta
(but not k) receptors were consistent with some inverse
agonist activity and contrasted with the modest agonist

activity of  xxxd2614xxx  at the recombinant mu and k (but
not delta) receptors. the increased spontaneous mechanical
activity and amplitude of efs-evoked contractions were
consistent with  xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011 possessing
 xxxd1422xxx  activity, the magnitude of which was larger in
the guinea pig ileum compared to the cell-based assays,
possibly as a result of a higher level of constitutive activity in
the tissue. while the validity of this hypothesis requires
further investigation,  xxxd1422xxx  activity of several
structural analogs of  xxxd134xxx  has been described previously (emmerson et al. 2004). data from radioligand binding
experiments, using na+ responsiveness to differentiate mu, k,
and  xxxg1632xxx  inverse agonism from neutral
antagonism in cho cells, indicated that a series of
4-phenylpiperidines behaved as inverse agonists (emmerson
et al. 2004). based on the relatively low potencies of
 xxxd134xxx  and adl 08-0011, with respect to enhancement
of the efs-evoked contractions (pec50 values of 8.0 and
7.5, respectively) and spontaneous activity (pec50 values of
8.2), and additional data generated in this study (see below),
it is postulated that an interaction at k rather than mu opioid
receptors may be involved. the magnitude of the agonist
activity of  xxxd2614xxx  in the ileum was lower than that

of the full agonists, morphine or damgo, and the partial
agonist, nalorphine. interestingly,  xxxd2614xxx  has been
claimed to augment rather than attenuate the efs-evoked
contractions of the guinea pig and human ileum (yuan et al.
1995). this discrepancy may relate to the higher efs
frequency (10 hz) used by yuan et al., compared to that
employed in this study (0.1 hz), under which circumstances
a higher level of muscarinic autoinhibition or inhibitory
endogenous opioid agonist tone may be present, allowing
reversal by the antagonist (or partial agonist) activity of
 xxxd2614xxx  to be observed. consistent with this
proposal, endomorphin-1 inhibits acetylcholine release from
myenteric neurons of the guinea pig ileum when an efs
frequency of 1 hz, but not 10 hz, is used (nishiwaki et al.
1998).
in agreement with previous studies using naloxone (collier
et al. 1981; lujan and rodriguez 1981), chronic (7-day)
morphine exposure influenced the profile of action of
 xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx . chronic
exposure to morphine has been claimed to shift the
equilibrium between the resting and constitutively active
states of the  xxxg1635xxx  in favor of the latter, an action
that may contribute to the development of opioid-induced
tolerance and physical dependence (sadée et al. 2005; wang
et al. 1994). basal adenylate cyclase activity is elevated in
cell lines transfected with mu opioid receptors and in the
guinea pig ileum after morphine exposure (ammer and
schulz 1993; chakrabarti et al. 1998; wang et al. 1994), and
naloxone and naltrexone, which have no ia in morphinenaive test systems, potentiate  xxxd1773xxx  levels after
morphine exposure (sadée et al. 2005; wang et al. 1994).
this phenomenon may explain why naloxone contracts
guinea pig ileum previously exposed to morphine, but is
devoid of such activity in naive tissue (collier et al. 1981;
lujan and rodriguez 1981). in this study, prior treatment of
animals with morphine resulted in a qualitatively similar
alteration in the profile of action of each compound tested
(i.e., a shift in the inhibitory to excitatory direction). data
implicate a role for mu and k opioid receptors in these
“withdrawal” responses, which are attributed to depolarization of myenteric neurons in opioid agonist-dependent tissue
(brent et al. 1993; johnson et al. 1987; valeri et al. 1995).
it is considered unlikely that the observations made in the
morphine-dependent ileum were due simply to antagonism of
residual morphine. tissues were washed thoroughly before
application of test compounds, and similar observations have
been made in the presence of transiently high tissue bath
concentrations of morphine (i.e., 10 mum for 30 min) when
ileum from morphine-dependent, but not morphine-naive
animals, was used (unpublished observations).
the potencies of  xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx , with respect to increasing the spontaneous
activity of the morphine-dependent ileum, were clearly

lower than their  xxxg1635xxx  binding affinities or pa2
values in electrically stimulated, morphine-naive tissue.
this anomaly could be explained, at least in part, by mu
opioid receptor desensitization, resulting from the chronic
morphine exposure. indeed, the agonist potencies of
morphine, damgo, and nalorphine (but not u69593) in
reducing efs-evoked contractions were lower in the ileum
from morphine-treated animals compared to naive tissue.
however, chronic morphine exposure has been claimed to
result in less desensitization than other  xxxg1635xxx 
agonists (bailey et al. 2003). to assess whether the
discrepancy in potencies may have reflected an interaction
with k or delta opioid receptors, at least with respect to
 xxxd134xxx , naive guinea pig ileum was pre-incubated with
the selective mu, delta, and k opioid receptor agonists, damgo,
dpdpe, and u69593, respectively (hirning et al. 1985;
lahti et al. 1985).  xxxd134xxx  (0.1 mum) was associated with
a marked increase in contractile activity of tissues preincubated with u69593, but not damgo or dpdpe. a
similar observation was made after pre-incubation with

morphine at a concentration (10 mum) that would be
anticipated to interact with k opioid receptors. this
observation was consistent with the findings from experiments in which morphine was administered chronically to
guinea pigs and tissue, then challenged with  xxxd134xxx .
however, as the methods of morphine pre-treatment
differed significantly (i.e., one performed entirely in vitro
compared to 7-day chronic exposure in vivo), data from
each should likely only be compared in qualitative terms.
furthermore, the  xxxd134xxx -mediated contractile activity of
the ileum pre-treated with either u69593 or morphine was
prevented by  xxxg1402xxx , a selective k opioid receptor antagonist
(jones and portoghese 2000). although there was a trend
for attenuation, incubation of tissues with either sdm25n
or ctap, selective delta and  xxxg1635xxx  antagonists,
respectively (mclamore et al. 2001; kramer et al. 1989),
together with morphine, had no statistically significant
effect on  xxxd134xxx -mediated responses. these data therefore suggest that k opioid receptor interaction may be
involved in the  xxxd134xxx -induced contractile activity of

218

morphine-dependent tissue, a proposal compatible with the
observation that k opioid antagonists contract the ileum
after exposure to k-selective agonists (brent et al. 1993;
valeri et al. 1995). failure to demonstrate a role for the delta
opioid receptor is consistent with the lack of effect of the
selective agonist, snc 80 (knapp et al. 1996), on efsevoked contractions in the morphine-naive ileum and the
minimal role for this receptor subtype in the guinea pig
ileum (shahbazian et al. 2002). based on the weight of
evidence from this study, it is concluded that interaction at
k, rather than mu or delta opioid receptors, plays the dominant
role in the  xxxd134xxx -induced contractions of the ileum
after morphine exposure. as k opioid receptor agonism is
associated with inhibitory activity of the guinea pig ileum,
the excitatory responses observed may reflect inverse
agonist activity. such a proposal requires additional
investigation, although it is evident that a number of other
opioid ligands do behave as k opioid receptor inverse
agonists in human and rodent cell lines (becker et al. 1999;
bennett et al. 2005; statnick et al. 2003).
the involvement of non-opioid activity in opioid receptor
antagonist-mediated contractions of morphine-naive and
morphine-exposed ileum has been proposed (mundey et al.
2000). desensitization to somatostatin, for example, results
in attenuation of naloxone-mediated contractions of the
guinea pig ileum exposed to morphine (mundey et al.
2000). therefore, while the activity observed in this study is
consistent with an interaction at, principally, k opioid
receptors, it is possible that other, non-opioid mechanisms
are involved.
in conclusion, this study has characterized the pharmacological profiles of the opioid receptor antagonists,
 xxxd134xxx , adl 08-0011, and  xxxd2614xxx . in morphine-naive guinea pig ileum, each compound antagonizes
mu and k opioid receptors with potencies and selectivities
consistent with recombinant receptor data in cell-based
assays (with the possible exception of  xxxd2614xxx  at
k). in morphine-naive guinea pig ileum,  xxxd134xxx  and
adl 08-0011 have excitatory, and  xxxd2614xxx ,
inhibitory actions. after morphine exposure, each compound is associated with increased spontaneous activity of
the ileum, although to a greater extent with  xxxd134xxx  and
adl 08-0011 than with  xxxd2614xxx . in the case of
 xxxd134xxx , an interaction at k opioid receptors is implicated, although additional studies will be required to investigate this proposal further and to assess whether a similar
mechanism contributes to the excitatory activities of adl
08-0011 and  xxxd2614xxx . the clinical significance, if
any, of the different intrinsic activities of  xxxd134xxx  (or its
metabolite) and  xxxd2614xxx , notable particularly in the
guinea pig ileum, remains to be determined. conceivably, an
 xxxd1422xxx  would produce a larger clinical effect in obd
patients than a partial agonist due to a more complete

naunyn-schmiedeberg’s arch pharmacol (2007) 375:205–220

reversal of the action of highly efficacious agonists such as
morphine. it is considered likely, however, that a more
marked gi withdrawal response, with its associated abdominal cramping, may also result in response to administration of an  xxxd1422xxx  compared to a partial agonist.
direct “head to head” clinical studies with  xxxd134xxx  and
 xxxd2614xxx  in obd patients may be required to test
the validity of this hypothesis.
