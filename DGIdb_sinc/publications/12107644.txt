abstract gallium arsenide (gaas), a group iii-va intermetallic semiconductor, possesses superior electronic
and optical properties and has a wide application in the
electronics industry. exposure to gaas in the semiconductor industry is a potential occupational hazard
because cleaning and slicing gaas ingots to yield the
desired wafer could generate gaas particles. the ability
of gaas to induce oxidative stress has not yet been
reported. the present study reports the role of oxidative
stress in gaas-induced haematological and liver disorders and its possible reversal overturn by administration
of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa) and one
of its analogue, monoisoamyl dmsa (miadmsa),
either individually or in combination with  xxxd2802xxx .
while dmsa and miadmsa are potential arsenic
chelators,  xxxd2802xxx  is reported to be an eﬀective gallium chelator. male rats were exposed to 10 mg/kg
gaas orally, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. gaas exposure
was then stopped and rats were given a 0.5 mmol/kg
dose of succimers (dmsa or miadmsa),  xxxd2802xxx 
or a combination of the two, intraperitoneally once
daily for 5 consecutive days. we found a signiﬁcant fall
in blood d- xxxd148xxx  dehydratase ( xxxg121xxx )
activity and blood glutathione (gsh) level, and an increased urinary excretion of d- xxxd148xxx 
(ala) and an increased malondialdehyde (mda) level
in erythrocytes of rats exposed to gaas. hepatic gsh
levels decreased, whereas there was an increase in
 xxxd2811xxx  and mda levels. the results suggest a role of

oxidative stress in gaas-induced haematological and
hepatic damage. administration of dmsa and miadmsa produced eﬀective recovery in most of the
above variables. however, a greater eﬀectiveness of the
chelation treatment (i.e. removal of both gallium and
arsenic from body organs) could be achieved by combined administration of succimer (dmsa) with
 xxxd2802xxx  since, after miadmsa administration, a
marked loss of essential metals (copper and zinc) is of
concern.

introduction
in the microelectronics industry, the substrate predominantly used for the semiconductor device is silicon.
however, gaas is one of the semiconductor materials
that is having an increased number of applications.
these materials are called iii-v intermetallic semiconductor substrates because they are composed of equimolar ratio of group iii and group v elements. gaas is a
crystalline solid of high density and can be prepared by
condensing vapours of the chemical forms of the metalloids. and thus gaas can be characterized as
ga(0)as(0). potential applications of gaas include high
frequency microwave and millimetre-wave communication, satellite communication, ground and space-based
radar, electronic warfare and intelligent weapons (carter
and sullivan 1992).
the toxic eﬀects of the intermetallic semiconductor
appear to occur primarily after inhalation exposure, although oral exposure to gaas also results in toxicity
(flora 2000; flora et al. 1998; webb et al. 1987). the
chemical form of the gaas does not appear to be as
important toxicologically as the chemical form of the
dissolution products (carter and sullivan 1992). gaas
dissociates into its constituent moieties both in vitro and

270

in vivo following oral and intratracheal instillation
(webb et al. 1984, 1986, 1987). a number of recent reports demonstrated that, in experimental animals, at
least one step in the haem synthesis as well as some
hepatic and brain biochemical variables might become
aﬀected by gaas (flora et al. 1994, 1997, 1999). exposure to gaas particles during the production of iii-v
semiconductor material occurs during sawing, grinding
or polishing of semiconductor wafers, or during the
maintenance of production equipment. the issue of
disposal of electronic devices containing these elements
and subsequent exposure of the general population has
been raised (fowler 1995) but, at present, there are no
plans to recycle these materials. the outcome of these
new trends in the development of metal-containing hightechnology materials is the increased need for better
understanding of the mechanism of their toxicity, development of early biomarkers, suitable preventive and
therapeutic measures, in vivo, as a consequence of
chronic low level exposures to gaas.
the mechanism of gaas toxicity and the factors that
mediate the toxicity are presently unknown. keeping in
view the fact that arsenic-induced toxic eﬀects on liver
and kidneys are largely mediated through oxidative
stress (flora 1999), we decided to investigate whether
gaas-induced toxic eﬀects on red blood cells (rbcs)
and hepatic tissues are also mediated through the same
mechanism.
it has been reported in the past that in vitro treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa,
succimer) could not reverse the immunosuppression
induced by in vivo exposure to gaas but that an altered form of dmsa (2:1 mixed disulﬁde) could be
useful to bind intracellular arsenic (burns et al. 1993).
we have compared the eﬃcacy of dmsa and sodium
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (dmps) in treating
sub-acute gaas poisoning. the results suggested that
both dmsa and dmps are marginally eﬀective in
reversing the altered immunological variables and
reducing tissue arsenic levels (flora and kumar 1996).
a few monoesters of dmsa have been reported to
have better lipophilic properties than british antilewisite (bal), dmsa and dmps (kreppel et al.
1993, 1995) and to be eﬀective antidotes for treating
lead, cadmium and mercury intoxication (walker et al.
1992; gale et al. 1993; xu et al. 1995). thus, with a
view to investigate possible therapeutic measures for
the depletion of the gallium and arsenic burden and
reversing altered biochemical variables in gaas preexposed rats we planned to determine (1) whether oxidative stress is associated with gaas-induced haematological and hepatic damage, and (2) whether
administration of dmsa and one of its analogue,
monoisoamyl dmsa (miadmsa), either alone or in
combination with  xxxd2802xxx  are capable of producing
recovery from these alterations. dmsa is a known
arsenic chelator (flora et al. 1995), whereas  xxxd2802xxx 
has been reported to be an eﬀective gallium chelator
(domingo et al. 1987).

materials and methods
chemicals
gallium arsenide (gaas, purity 99.9%) was obtained from aldrich chemicals (milwaukee, wis., usa); meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa) and d- xxxd148xxx  (ala)
were from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo., usa). all the
other chemicals were of highest purity available from a commercial source.
monoisoamyl dmsa was synthesized in our synthetic
chemistry division by the controlled esteriﬁcation of dmsa
with the corresponding alcohol in acidic medium (jones et al.
1992). the products were puriﬁed and characterized using spectral and analytical methods before animal experimentation. all
the samples were stored refrigerated in a dessicator to avoid
oxidation and thermal decomposition. each monoester was
dissolved in 10 ml ethanol plus 5% sodium bicarbonate solution
(1:10). dmsa was dissolved in 10 ml sodium bicarbonate
solution. all the antidote solutions were prepared immediately
before use. the injection volume amounted to 4 ml/kg body
weight.
animals and treatment
sixty male wistar albino rats weighing approximately 120±10 g
were obtained from the defence research and development
establishment (drde) animal facility. prior to dosing they were
acclimatized for 7 days to light from 0600 to 1800 h alternating
with 12 h darkness. the animal room was maintained at 25c.
the animal use committee of drde, gwalior, india, approved the protocols for the experiments. rats were allocated to
two groups of 30 rats each such that the group means and
standard deviations for body weight were approximately equal.
a set of 30 animals received 10 mg/kg gaas by gastric intubation daily 5 days a week for 8 weeks. control (normal) animals
(30) received the same dose of vehicle by the same route. gaas
was suspended in phosphate buﬀer (0.1 m, ph 6.5) and administered within 5 min of buﬀer addition. this procedure ensured that a minimal amount of gaas would be in soluble form
at the time of administration. rats were provided with adequate
water and pelleted diet (lipton india ltd., calcutta, india; metal
contents of diet, in ppm dry weight: zn 45, cu 10, mn 55, fe
70, co 5).
at the end of 8 weeks of exposure, rats with or without preexposure to gaas were allocated to six groups of ﬁve rats each and
treated as below for ﬁve consecutive days:

• group 1: saline
• group 2: dmsa, 0.5 mmol/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), once
•
•
•
•

daily
group 3: miadmsa, 0.5 mmol/kg i.p., once daily
group 4:  xxxd2802xxx , 0.5 mmol/kg i.p., once daily
group 5: dmsa +  xxxd2802xxx  as in group 2 and 4, respectively
group 6: miadmsa +  xxxd2802xxx  as in group 3 and 4,
respectively

gaas administration was stopped during the chelation
treatment. the dosages for gaas and chelators were selected on
the basis of some preliminary studies performed by us (s.j.s.
flora, a. mehta, g.m. kannan, sn dube and b.p. pant, unpublished data) and a few reported studies (gale et al. 1993; xu
et al. 1995).
twenty-four hours after the last injection, the animals were
lightly anaesthetized under ether and blood samples were collected
via intracardiac puncture. the animals were killed and samples of
kidneys, spleen, liver and brain were collected for various biochemical assays and determination of gallium and arsenic concentrations.

biochemical assays

statistical analysis

blood d- xxxd148xxx  dehydratase ( xxxg121xxx ) activity,
zinc protoporphyrin (zpp) level and urinary excretion of
d- xxxd148xxx  (ala)

data are expressed as means ±sem. data analyses were carried
out using one-way analysis of variance followed by tukey’s
multiple comparison tests to compare means between the diﬀerent
treatment groups. any diﬀerence between unexposed (with or
without chelation) and treatment means with a p-value <0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant.

the activity of blood  xxxg121xxx  activity was assayed according to the
procedure of berlin and schaller (1974). the assay system consisted
of 0.2 ml heparinized blood and 1.3 ml distilled water. after 10 min
of incubation at 37c for complete haemolysis, 1 ml standard ala
was added to the tubes, which were then incubate for 60 min at
37c. the reaction was stopped after 1 h by adding 1 ml trichloroacetic acid. an equal volume of ehrlich reagent was added to the
supernatant and the absorbance was recorded at 555 nm after
5 min.
urinary ala excretion was determined using a dual ion
exchange chromatographic procedure (davis et al. 1968).
zpp was determined in a drop of blood using a haematoﬂuorometer (model 2060; aviv, lakewood, n.j., usa) and a calibrated glass slide (grandjean 1979).

blood and liver glutathione (gsh) and hepatic oxidized
glutathione ( xxxd2811xxx ) levels
for the determination of blood gsh concentration (ellman
1959), 200 ll whole blood was added to 200 ll of a 10 mm
solution of 5,5’-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb) in phosphate buﬀer (ph 7.5) containing 17.5 mm na2edta. samples
were centrifuged at 2000 g for 6 min and the supernatant used for
assay.
for the assay of gsh in liver (hissin and hilf 1976), 0.5 ml
supernatant and 4.5 ml phosphate buﬀer (ph 8.0) were mixed.
the ﬁnal assay mixture (2.0 ml) contained 100 ll supernatant,
1.8 ml phosphate-edta buﬀer and 100 ll o-phthaldehyde
(1000 ll/ml in absolute methanol, freshly prepared). addition of
1 ml hpo3 was used to precipitate protein. after mixing, ﬂuorescence was determined at 420 nm with an excitation wavelength
of 350 nm using a spectroﬂurometer (model rf 5000 shimadzu,
tokyo, japan).
for the assay of  xxxd2811xxx , 0.5 ml supernatant was incubated at
room temperature with 200 ll of a 0.04 mol/l n- xxxd2684xxx 
solution for 30 min. to this mixture was added 4.3 ml of 0.1 mol/l
naoh. a 100-ll sample of this mixture was taken for the measurement of  xxxd2811xxx  by the procedure described above for gsh
except that 0.1 mol/l naoh was used as the diluent rather than
phosphate buﬀer (stocks and dormandy 1971).

results
body and tissue weights and food and water intake
gaas exposure for 8 weeks led to a signiﬁcant reduction
in body weight while liver weight increased. kidney
weight remained statistically unchanged compared with
control animals. these changes could be attributed to an
average reduction in food intake in these animals during
exposure (data not tabulated). no eﬀect of chelation
treatment (individually or in combination) on the above
variables was noted in animals with or without pre-exposure to gaas.
blood  xxxg121xxx , zpp, gsh, mda and urinary
ala excretion

lipid peroxidation was measured in erythrocytes as mda formed
by the thiobarbituric acid reaction (wilber et al. 1949). hepatic
lipid peroxidation (mda) was measured by shaking the liver homogenate in 150 mm kcl for 30 min at 37c and determination of
the mda formed in the thiobarbituric acid reaction. the amount
of mda was calculated using a molar extinction coeﬃcient of
1.56·105/m per cm.

blood  xxxg121xxx  decreased while urinary ala excretion
increased signiﬁcantly following gaas exposure in rats
(table 1). blood gsh and haemoglobin levels (not
shown in table) also exhibited a depletion, while zpp
and mda levels increased signiﬁcantly after 8 weeks of
gaas exposure. blood haemoglobin (not shown) and
zpp levels did not respond to the chelation treatment
whereas blood  xxxg121xxx  activity recovered signiﬁcantly in
animals treated with dmsa and  xxxd2802xxx , when given
either individually or in combination. treatment with
miadmsa alone had no eﬀect whereas the combined
treatment of  xxxd2802xxx  plus miadmsa was eﬀective in
the reversal of the gaas-induced inhibition of  xxxg121xxx 
activity and gsh. both the succimers administered individually or in combination with  xxxd2802xxx  were able
to reduce mda levels. the best results were achieved
following the combined treatment of miadmsa plus
 xxxd2802xxx . urinary ala excretion also showed a similar pattern and the combined treatment of dmsa plus
 xxxd2802xxx  was better than any of the others in reducing
the urinary ala excretion in gaas pre-exposed rats
(fig. 1).

element analysis

hepatic and renal gsh,  xxxd2811xxx  and mda results

arsenic concentrations in blood, liver, kidneys and brain were
measured after wet acid digestion using a microwave digestion
system (model mds-2100; cem, matthews, n.c., usa). arsenic
was estimated using a hydride vapour generation system (model
mhs-10; perkin-elmer, foster city, calif., usa) ﬁtted with an
atomic absorption spectrophotometer (aas) (perkin-elmer model
aanalyst 100). gallium, zinc and copper contents were also
measured in the digested tissue samples using aas (parker et al.
1967).

hepatic gsh decreased, while mda and  xxxd2811xxx  levels
increased signiﬁcantly on gaas exposure (table 2). the
hepatic gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio also decreased signiﬁcantly in
gaas-exposed rats, indicating hepatic oxidative injury.
hepatic gsh recovered to normal levels in animals
treated with  xxxd2802xxx  and dmsa individually,
whereas administration of miadmsa was ineﬀective.

blood and tissue gallium concentrations
table 3 indicates the eﬀect of dmsa, miadmsa or
 xxxd2802xxx , either individually or in combination, on the
gallium content of blood, hepatic, renal and spleen.
gallium could not be detected in these organs in normal
animals.  xxxd2802xxx  was most eﬀective in depleting
gallium contents from these tissues, whereas dmsa and
miadmsa were ineﬀective when administered alone.
the best results, however, were achieved when the animals were co-administered  xxxd2802xxx  and dmsa/miadmsa, compared with all other treatments.

fig. 1. eﬀects of  xxxd2802xxx  and succimers, or their combined

meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa) or monoisoamyl
dmsa (miadmsa) administration on urinary ala excretion
in animals was observed without prior exposure to gaas (data not
shown). a,b,c,ddiﬀerences between values of columns with matching
letter notations are not statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level of
probability

miadmsa administration in combination with oxalic
acid, however, produced an eﬀective reversal of altered
gsh levels in gaas pre-exposed rats. combined administration of  xxxd2802xxx  with dmsa had no additional beneﬁt in rats over the eﬀects of dmsa alone.
hepatic  xxxd2811xxx  levels in gaas-exposed rats recovered
signiﬁcantly after treatment with miadmsa or oxalic
acid, whereas dmsa administration, individually and in
combination with  xxxd2802xxx , was ineﬀective. only a
marginal beneﬁcial eﬀect of chelation therapy on hepatic
gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio was observed. elevated mda levels
were eﬀectively reduced by miadmsa, either individually or in combination with  xxxd2802xxx . all other
treatments were marginally beneﬁcial.

blood and tissue arsenic concentrations
table 4 reports arsenic concentrations of blood, liver,
kidney and spleen in gaas-exposed animals. miadmsa was comparatively more eﬀective than dmsa in
decreasing blood and tissue arsenic concentrations. no
additional beneﬁcial eﬀects of  xxxd2802xxx , either alone
or in combination with dmsa or miadmsa, were
noticed except for a more pronounced decrease in liver
or spleen arsenic contents in animals treated with
miadmsa plus  xxxd2802xxx  or dmsa plus oxalic
acid, respectively, than with any of the other treatments.
blood and tissue zinc and copper concentrations
zinc and copper contents remained unaltered on gaas
exposure (tables 5, 6). treatment with  xxxd2802xxx  or
dmsa, either individually or when given in combination, also had no eﬀect on zinc or copper in any of the
tissues. however, miadmsa signiﬁcantly decreased
the copper content of blood and liver in animals, with or
without prior exposure to gaas.

discussion
oxidative stress could be a possible mechanism for some
of the toxic eﬀects of gaas on haem synthesis and hepatic tissues (goering et al. 1988; flora et al. 1998,
1999). the haematological system has been proposed as
being an important target site for gaas-induced toxicity. the eﬀects of gaas on this system are thought to
result in decreased haem synthesis and anaemia (flora
2000; flora et al. 1997, 1998, 1999). the present study
was thus planned to investigate (1) whether oxidative
stress is associated with gaas-induced rbc and hepatic
damage and, (2) whether these alterations could be reversed with the depletion of body ga and as burden by
administrating a thiol chelator (dmsa or one of its
analogues, miadmsa) either individually or in combination with  xxxd2802xxx .
rbcs generally have a high aﬃnity for metals and
typically contain high amounts of heavy metal in the
blood stream (leggett 1993). factors that may contribute to rbcs’ sensitivity to oxidative damage include
its high exposure to oxygen, auto-oxidation of haemo-

globin, vulnerability of the rbc membrane to lipid
peroxidation and limited capacity to repair the damaged
components (rice-evan 1990; gurer et al. 1998). gaas
may induce oxidative stress by altering the antioxidant
system in erythrocytes. gaas has also been shown to
increase urinary excretion of ala by inhibiting the
enzyme  xxxg121xxx , which is involved in the rate-limiting
step of the haem biosynthesis pathway (gibbs et al.
1991). it is possible that gaas-induced cellular damage
may originate in part from ala-induced oxidative
stress. ala is a haem precursor that accumulates in
several disorders (demasi et al. 1996). an increased intracellular level of ala has been shown to generate
reactive oxygen intermediates (rois) and oxidative
stress (hermes-lima et al. 1991). it is interesting that
blood gsh decreased moderately while there was a
marked increase of mda levels in blood suggesting that
gaas perhaps may not be acting directly to increase free
radical formation. because gaas is known to inhibit
 xxxg121xxx  activity leading to the accumulation of ala
(goering et al. 1988; flora et al. 1997, 1999), there is
thus a possibility that ala might be auto-oxidizing and
then increasing hydroxyl free radicals, so supporting the

hypothesis that ala might be acting directly. this hypothesis is supported to some extent by the fact that,
associated with the decrease in urinary ala excretion,
there was a marked protection in the parameters indicative of oxidative stress in erythrocytes and hepatic
tissue in animals co-administered  xxxd2802xxx  and
dmsa. it can thus be suggested that gaas-induced
oxidative stress could result from (1) accumulation of
ala due to disturbed haem synthesis pathway, (2) interaction of the ga or as moiety with biological membranes and mda production, and (3) generation of roi
by ala accumulation. there could be another possible
mechanism for gaas-induced oxidative stress, i.e. interaction of ga with cellular iron metabolism; in particular, the eﬀects of ga on iron transport and storage in
ferritin, which has been reported earlier (kojima et al.
1984; seligman et al. 1992). given the potential role of
iron as a catalyst for the generation of reactive oxygen
species, the interaction of ga with iron binding transport protein may be of concern and should be explored.
signiﬁcant depletion of liver gsh, a pivotal component of mammalian cells’ intrinsic antioxidant system
(ketterer et al. 1983; ercal et al. 1996) was observed following gaas exposure. the role of gsh as scavenger and
a cofactor in the metabolic detoxiﬁcation of roi is well
known (bray and taylor 1993) and suggests enhanced free
radical generation in presence of arsenic or gallium in liver
tissues. in addition, the oxidized form of glutathione and
hepatic mda levels also increased. a number of studies in
the past have suggested the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio as a sensitive indicator of oxidative stress (sandhir et al. 1994; ercal
et al. 1996) and we also observed a signiﬁcant fall in
hepatic gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio in gaas-exposed rats, which
showed pronounced recovery after treatment with thiols.
ercal et al. (1996) also suggested a protective value of
dmsa against lead-induced oxidative stress. although it
is diﬃcult to assume that this protection is due to the direct
action of dmsa or miadmsa, it could be related to the
depletion of toxic metals from the site of action following
chelation. it is interesting to note that  xxxd2802xxx  was able
to remove gallium from blood and tissues but had no role
in the reversal of oxidative stress, suggesting arsenic as the
principal constituent moiety in gaas that is responsible
for oxidative injury. thus, it is important to include a thiol
containing antioxidant during chelation of arsenic (flora
1999). a moderate antioxidant action of dmsa is
reported but this has not been very eﬀective in the reversal
of altered parameters. dmsa was, however, signiﬁcantly
eﬀective in depleting arsenic concentration for blood and
tissue. from these results we could suggest that in order to
obtain an optimum eﬀect of chelation therapy it is better
to include an antioxidant during combined dmsa/oxalic
acid therapy for the treatment of gaas intoxication.
further, combined miadmsa/ xxxd2802xxx  treatment
also proved equally eﬀective, if not better; however,
marked depletion of essential metals like copper and zinc
following miadmsa administration is of concern and
may restrict its prolonged therapeutic use.
