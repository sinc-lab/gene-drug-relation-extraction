early development in zebrafish. j. neurophysiol. 81: 2852–2861,
1999. we have examined the rapid development of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (nmj) in zebrafish embryos
and larvae by patch-clamp recording of spontaneous miniature endplate currents (mepcs) and single acetylcholine receptor (achr)
channels. embryonic (24 –36 h) mepcs recorded in vivo were small
in amplitude (,50 pa). the rate of mepcs increased in larvae
(3.5-fold increase measured by 6 days), and these mepcs were mostly
of larger amplitude (10-fold on average) with (#5-fold) faster kinetics. intracellular labeling with lucifer yellow indicated extensive
coupling between muscle cells in both embryos and larvae (#10
days). blocking acetylcholinesterase (ache) with  xxxd2940xxx  had no
effect on mepc kinetics in embryos at 1 day and only partially slowed
(by ;1⁄2) the decay rate in larvae at 6 days. in acutely dissociated
muscle cells, we observed the same two types of achr with conductances of 45 and 60 ps and with similar, brief (,0.5 ms) mean open
times in both embryos and larvae. we conclude that achr properties
are set early during development at these early stages; functional
maturation of the nmj is only partly shaped by expression of ache
and may also depend on postsynaptic achr clustering and presynaptic maturation.

introduction

understanding the mechanism of synapse formation during
embryonic development is an important goal of neurobiology.
much of what we know about the formation and maturation of
synapses is based on studies of the highly accessible peripheral
neuromuscular junction (nmj). the cellular and molecular
events taking place during embryonic development of the nmj
have been characterized in considerable detail in vitro and in
vivo in a variety of vertebrate and mammalian species (reviewed by hall and sanes 1993; jacobson 1991). ultimately,
the cellular analysis of functional development needs to be
determined in vivo. detailed studies of neuromuscular synapse
formation have been performed with cultured cells, but only a
few studies have examined the functional changes occurring in
vivo because of the difficulty of performing electrophysiological recordings in early embryos.
early studies (before the advent of high-resolution patchclamp techniques) reported developmental transitions in endplate potentials in the embryonic rat (bennett and pettigrew
1974; dennis et al. 1981; diamond and miledi 1962) and

xenopus (kullberg et al. 1977). we chose to investigate the
development of neuromuscular transmission in the zebrafish
for a variety of reasons. first, this animal offers the advantage
of obtaining large numbers of externally fertilized eggs at
precise developmental stages that are easily identified because
of the optical clarity of the embryos. in particular, the migrations and pathfinding of identified neurons such as the spinal
motoneurons have been described in detail in the embryo and
larva (myers et al. 1986; westerfield et al. 1986) and appear to
be related to the onset of early locomotor behaviors (saintamant and drapeau 1998). however, only limited physiological information is available concerning the development and
properties of neuromuscular synaptic transmission (grunwald
et al. 1988; liu and westerfield 1988; westerfield et al. 1986).
in particular, an analysis of the endplate currents (epcs) and
the underlying single acetylcholine receptor (achr) properties
has not been done to date during in vivo nmj maturation in
any preparation. another interest of the zebrafish is that recent
genetic screens have identified mutations affecting embryonic
locomotor behaviors (granato et al. 1996), suggesting that the
molecular bases of the development of these behaviors can be
studied. however, an accurate description of the mutant phenotypes requires the characterization of the functional deficits
before precise knowledge of the consequences of gene mutations can be established. a functional definition of embryonic
locomotion requires an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the maturation of motoneurons and of neuromuscular synaptic transmission, which together constitute “the
final common pathway for all behavioral acts” (sherrington
1947).
to examine the properties of developing neuromuscular
synapses in the zebrafish, we have combined whole muscle cell
patch-clamp recordings of synaptic activity in the embryo and
larva in vivo and recordings of single achrs in acutely dissociated muscle fibers at these two early developmental stages.
by recording postsynaptic currents, we have been able to relate
the properties of synaptic transmission to single achr channels. previous morphological studies have shown that the three
primary motoneurons on either side of each of the segmented
spinal cord somites extend axons that reach the muscle fibers
along the middle of the segmental myotomes and form tiny “en
passant” synapses starting at 17 h after fertilization (liu and
westerfield 1992; myers et al. 1986; westerfield et al. 1986),
which is the time at which spontaneous contractions of the tail
are first observed (saint-amant and drapeau 1998). these
contractions eventually cease, and by 27 h the embryos swim
briefly in response to a touch (eaton and farley 1973; kimmel

et al. 1972; saint-amant and drapeau 1998), the time at which
the more numerous secondary motoneurons innervate the muscles (myers et al. 1986; westerfield et al. 1986). the embryos
hatch on the second day of development, and within a few days
the newborn larvae swim in short bursts at near-maximal rates
(eaton and farley 1973; kimmel et al. 1972; saint-amant and
drapeau 1998). we found it difficult to completely suppress
(e.g., with ttx or high-mg/low-ca concentrations) the largeamplitude contractions, with the tail reaching the head of
unrestrained embryos. it was thus not possible to maintain
patch-clamp recordings from the very fragile (unfused) muscle
cells in embryos ,24 h old. we report here our observations
with embryos between 24 and 30 h, when swimming is first
manifested (saint-amant and drapeau 1998), and contrast
these with the observations in 3- to 6-day larvae, when swimming has reached a maximal rate. we show that the mepcs
increase greatly in frequency, amplitude, and kinetics during
this early period of maturation without a change in achr
properties.
methods

embryonic and larval zebrafish preparations
whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of mepcs were performed on
living zebrafish embryos and larvae (ages 24 h to 6 days). all
procedures were carried out in compliance with the guidelines stipulated by the canadian council for animal care and mcgill university. intact animals were anesthetized by immersion in tricaine (0.1
mg/ml, sigma) dissolved in a modified extracellular saline solution
(westerfield et al. 1986) consisting of (in mm) 116 nacl, 2 kcl, 0.7
cacl2, 10 mgcl2, 10 glucose, and 10 hepes, adjusted to ph 7.2, 290
mosmol. the reduced calcium and elevated magnesium concentrations were necessary to attenuate muscle contractions during our
experiments. in some experiments, 1 mm ttx (sigma) was added,
and similar results were obtained. fine tungsten wires (0.001 in.) were
used to securely pin specimens through the notochord onto a sylgardlined petri dish. a glass needle and fine forceps were used to expose
the axial muculature of a specimen by lifting and then carefully
peeling its skin. after this initial procedure, tricaine was washed out
and replaced with drug-free saline. the viability of the preparation
was assessed by looking for vigorous heart contractions and blood
circulation.

whole cell voltage-clamp recordings
standard whole cell voltage-clamp recordings (hamill et al. 1981)
were performed on dorsal and ventral muscle fibers (epaxial and
hypaxial muscles) (see myers 1985) in vivo under direct visualization
with the use of hoffmann modulation optics (340 water immersion
lens, nikon labophot microscope). all experiments were performed
at room temperature (22°c). patch-clamp electrodes were pulled from
thin-walled, kimax-51 borosilicate glass (3- to 5-mv resistance) and
were filled with (in mm) 130 cscl, 2 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 10 egta,
and 4 naatp, ph 7.2, 290 mosmol. the series resistance (5–10 mv)
was compensated by 60 – 80%. whole cell currents were recorded
with an axopatch-1d amplifier (axon instruments), filtered at 2 khz
(23 db) and digitized  xxxd1891xxx  khz, allowing the resolution of events
with rise times of .0.1 ms. data were acquired with pclamp 6.0
software (axon instruments) and were analyzed off-line with axograph 3.5 (axon instruments). cells with resting potentials less than
250 mv were discarded, and all recordings were obtained from a
holding potential of 260 mv. for some experiments 0.1 mm  xxxd2940xxx 
(sigma), an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (ache), was dissolved
in the modified saline solution, and specimens were preincubated in

2853

drug for #30 min before recording to ensure penetration of the
 xxxd2940xxx . we performed statistical comparisons by using a kolmogorov-smirnov test for mepc data.

dye coupling
in some experiments fluorescent lucifer yellow (li salt; sigma)
was included (0.1%) in the patch pipette solution to determine the
extent of coupling between the muscle cells at different developmental stages. in some experiments we added 1–3 mm halothane, 1-octanol, or 1-heptanol (sigma) to the extracellular solution and superfused the preparations for #30 min before starting the recordings to
uncouple the cells with these gap junction blockers. the cells were
photographed with a still camera after removing the pipette at the end
of the experiment.

acute dissociation of muscle cells
to enhance recording of single achrs, we acutely dissociated
muscle cells by treating skinned embryos (as described previously) for
5–10 min with 0.1% collagenase (type xii, sigma chemical) dissolved in normal extracellular solution (containing 1.3 mm cacl2 and
1 mm mgcl2). the collagenase was washed off, and the cells were
dissociated with a fine glass needle while incubating the tissue fragments in a modified recording solution that was nominally mg- and
ca-free and that contained 2 mm edta. dissociated cells were
transferred to tissue culture dishes coated with polylysine (sigma) to
enhance cell adhesion and were kept in normal extracellular solution
for #2 h. no obvious changes in cell morphology were noticed during
these short time periods.

single-channel recording
electrodes of 5- to 10-mv resistance were coated with dental wax
to ;50 mm of their tips, and the recording solution level was kept low
to reduce capacitive noise (,0.3 pa rms). the electrodes were filled
with either recording solution containing 1.3 mm cacl2, 1 mm
mgcl2, and 0.4 mm ach for cell-attached recordings or with kcl
pipette solution (as for whole cell recordings, but containing kcl
instead of cscl) for recording in the outside-out configuration (hamill
et al. 1981). recordings were filtered at 5 khz (23 db) and digitized
at 20 khz. data were stored to computer disk or digital tape and were
analyzed off-line with pclamp 6 software (axon instruments). for
some experiments, cells were continuously superfused with recording
solution containing drugs (0.4 mm ach, 10 mm  xxxd3456xxx ;
sigma). the membrane potential of the muscle fibers was determined
in the whole cell configuration and was used to correct the pipette
potential applied during recordings.
results

morphological features of embryonic and larval muscle
fibers in vivo
as an initial step toward a physiological characterization of
neuromuscular synaptic properties in living zebrafish embryos,
we compared the morphological features of myotomes and
muscle fibers in embryos and larvae at two different developmental stages. between 24 and 30 h postfertilization, chevronshaped myotomes (fig. 1a) were clearly demarcated in the
dorsal (top) and ventral regions of the zebrafish embryo. however, individual myocytes within each segmental myotome
could not be clearly discerned at this stage. ventral axial
muscles were less prominent at this stage than were dorsal
muscles. in sharp contrast larvae showed long, fused muscle
fibers with discrete striations at 2-mm intervals (an isolated

between the m and the tip of the pipette in a, and a long, fused

mepcs are small in size and slow in kinetics in the embryo (a)
but have increased in amplitude and show faster kinetics in the
larva (b). whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained at
a holding potential of 260 mv in this and all subsequent mepc
recordings. inset of each micrograph shows overall appearance of
the zebrafish embryo and larva at these 2 developmental stages.
in embryos, there is a large yolk sac situated just caudal to the
head region. in these micrographs, dorsal is on top and rostral is
to the left. scale bar: 20 mm for muscle micrographs, 1 mm for
insets.

muscle fiber from a 3-day larva is shown more clearly in fig.
4a2), and the demarcations between individual fibers were
clearly evident (fig. 1b). at this stage of development, skin
peeling was easily performed, and the result was invariably a
more pristine and intact preparation than with embryos.
differential activity profiles in living embryos and larvae
we compared the spontaneous neuromuscular synaptic activity profiles of embryos (24 –36 h) and larvae (3– 6 days). we
bathed the preparations in a high-mg/low-ca solution to prevent muscle contractions and to isolate spontaneous (presumably quantal) events. the recordings were performed near the
middle of the somite, where neuromuscular innervation occurs
(liu and westerfield 1992). similar levels of synaptic activity
were observed in preliminary experiments (not shown) in the
presence of 1 mm ttx at a normal ca concentration compared
with the levels observed in high-mg/low-ca solution at both
stages of development, indicating that these were spontaneous,
not evoked, events. in embryos, whole cell voltage-clamp
recordings of spontaneous miniature epcs (mepcs) revealed a
mean frequency of 26 6 20 (sd) min21 (n 5 5; fig. 1b shows
selected traces with several events each). in contrast, in 6-day
larvae, the mean frequency was significantly higher, 92 6 38
min21 (n 5 5; p , 0.01). hence the mean frequency of
spontaneous synaptic transmitter release was ;3.5-fold higher
in the 6-day larvae than in the more immature 1-day embryos.
the mepcs were blocked at all stages in the presence of 10
mm  xxxd3456xxx , as shown previously for the block of
neuromuscular transmission in larvae (grunwald et al. 1988).

mepcs recorded in embryos and larvae show distinct kinetic
characteristics
a casual inspection of mepcs recorded in embryos (fig.
1a) and larvae (fig. 1b) revealed two primary characteristics.
first, mepcs recorded from embryos were invariably small in
size, in contrast to the larger mepcs measured from larvae.
second, the embryonic mepcs were slower in their kinetics of
onset and decay than those observed in larvae. in general,
mepcs with fast kinetics of onset and decay emerged at
;36 – 42 h of development (not shown), and the transition
from slow to fast mepc kinetics was largely completed by 3
days of development.
a more thorough analysis of these mepcs showed that in
embryos the mean amplitude was 12.3 6 10.4 pa (n 5 5
muscle cells, in different animals). the amplitudes measured in
larvae were significantly greater, 62.3 6 16.1 pa at 3 days and
122.2 6 120.7 pa at 6 days (p , 0.005, n 5 5 preparations;
fig. 2, a–e, and table 1). the median amplitudes at 27 h and
6 days were 7 and 73 pa, respectively (fig. 2f). in no case
could the amplitude histograms be described by a single gaussian distribution. in summary, spontaneous mepcs recorded at
these two developmental stages differed significantly in their
mean amplitudes.
we also observed significant age-dependent increases in the
kinetics of onset and decay of mepcs. the average mepc rise
times (10 –90% maximum amplitude) in 24- to 36-h embryos
versus 3- and 6-day larvae were 2.4 6 2.1 ms versus 0.23 6
0.04 ms and 0.49 6 0.28 ms, respectively (p , 0.0001 for
embryos compared with larvae, n 5 5 for each age; table 1).

prolonged onset and decay kinetics in embryonic mepcs compared with mepcs obtained in a larva. rise times (10 –90%) of the
traces obtained in embryos and larvae were 1.8 and 0.9 ms, respectively. decay time constants for these traces were 6 ms for the
embryonic mepcs and 1.6 ms for the larval epcs. d: histogram of mepc amplitude distribution at 27 h. most mepcs were ,50
pa in size. e: histogram of mepc amplitude distribution at 6 days. larger mepcs were more evident in larvae than in embryos,
resulting in a more skewed distribution. no single quantal distribution of amplitude peaks was evident at either stage of
development. f: cumulative histogram of mepc amplitudes measured in a 27-h embryo and a 6-day larva. median mepc sizes
for embryos and larvae were 7 and 73 pa, respectively.

the medians of the rise time distributions for these two stages
were 1.95 ms in embryos and 0.35 ms in 6 day larvae, respectively (fig. 3a). in embryos, the mean decay time constant of
mepcs was 7.2 6 2.3 ms (table 1), which was significantly
longer (p , 0.0001) than the mean decay time constant measured in larvae at 3 days (1.3 6 0.4) and 6 days (2.1 6 1.3 ms;
table 1). the median decay time constants for these two stages
were 6.8 ms in embryos and 1.5 ms in 6-day larvae, respectively (fig. 3b). finally, there were clear biases in the distributions of mepc sizes and their matching decay times at both
stages (fig. 3c). at 27 h, mepcs were distributed such that the
majority had decay time constants of .4 ms and amplitudes of
,50 pa. in larvae by sharp contrast, mepcs observed at 3 and
6 days had decay time constants that were mostly ,2 ms, with
relatively few events .4 ms in duration (fig. 3c), and most of
these mepcs had amplitudes of .100 pa.

coupling between muscle cells
one possible explanation for the presence of smaller and
slower events in the embryonic muscle cells is if these are
extensively coupled in the embryo and the coupling is lost at
the larval stage, as described for xenopus embryos (armstrong
et al. 1983) where the coupling is lost within 2 days of
formation of the nmj. accordingly, the embryonic cells would
be more affected by cable (or syncytial) filtering. we examined
this by including the small, gap junction-permeable fluorescent
dye lucifer yellow in the patch pipette. as shown in fig. 4, b
and d, many other muscle cells were labeled with lucifer
yellow, indicating extensive coupling in both embryos (fig. 4,
a and b) and larvae (fig. 4, c and d). larval muscle cells
remained coupled for #10 days, and only in older larvae (.14
days) did lucifer yellow not pass into other cells (not shown),
indicating a rather delayed uncoupling. however, the muscle
fibers were too large at this stage for whole cell recordings of
mepcs.
in other experiments (not shown) we attempted to uncouple
muscle cells in younger larvae and embryos by incubating
these in the presence of 1–3 mm of the common gap junction
uncouplers halothane, 1-octanol, or 1-heptanol (de roos et al.
1996; niggli et al. 1989). halothane and 1-octanol failed to
uncouple the cells; although 1-heptanol prevented coupling, it
also eliminated mepcs even at late stages (2–3 wk) when
coupling was no longer present, suggesting a toxic effect, e.g.,
such as blockage of achrs (murrell et al. 1991). we were

times. in 27-h embryos and 6-day larvae, mepcs
showed median rise times (10 –90% maximum
amplitudes) of 1.95 and 0.35 ms, respectively. b:
cumulative histogram of mepc decay time constants at 27 h showed longer decay times than at
6 days. median times for these 2 stages were 6.8
and 1.5 ms, respectively. after acute treatment
with  xxxd2940xxx  (0.1 mm), a cholinesterase inhibitor, the decay times in larvae were significantly
prolonged, with a median decay time now
shifted to 3.3 ms.  xxxd2940xxx  had no significant
effect on decay times of embryonic mepcs. c:
bivariate scattergrams of mepc amplitudes and
their corresponding decay time constants. each
point represents a single mepc recorded in a
27-h embryo (top) and in larvae at 3 days (middle) or at 6 days (bottom). most embryonic
mepcs are smaller than 50 pa and have decay
times of .4 ms. in contrast, most larval mepcs
(at 3 and 6 days) are larger than 100 pa and have
decay time constants of ,1–2 ms.

therefore unable to directly test the effects of coupling on
mepc properties and conclude that extensive coupling exists at
all the stages we could record from.
the small fraction (,5%) of low amplitude (,100 pa),
slow (.4 ms) mepcs observed in larvae (fig. 3) could represent immature events similar to those observed in embryos or
perhaps represent a minor population of poorly clamped events
in the larger, larval muscle fibers, although we recorded from
the middle of the fibers, presumably close to where they are
innervated. that the mepcs at 6 days were somewhat slower
on average than at 3 days (table 1) and had more of the very
slow events (.4 ms) suggests that there was a small but
gradual decrease in the effectiveness of the space clamp. this
is consistent with an increase in muscle fiber size during this
developmental period, and we were unable to effectively voltage clamp muscle cells in older larvae. we conclude that the
mepcs recorded in 24- to 27-h embryos were, on average,
;10-fold smaller in size and 3- to 4-fold slower in kinetics of
onset and decay than were mepcs measured in 6-day larvae.
differential effects of ache inhibition on mepc decay times
what might be the molecular bases of the developmental
difference in mepc decay time constants? we addressed this
question by first examining the effects of acute exposure of
axial muscles to an inhibitor of ache. we reasoned that
blocking ache, which hydrolyzes and inactivates the neuromuscular transmitter, should prolong the decay time constants
of mepcs because of decreased breakdown of and consequent
prolonged exposure to ach in the synaptic cleft. we found

that, for embryos, 0.1 mm  xxxd2940xxx  had no significant effect on
the mean decay time constant (6.0 6 1.9 ms vs. 7.2 6 2.3 ms
in controls; p . 0.2, see fig. 3b and table 2). a similar lack
of effect was observed at 1 mm  xxxd2940xxx  (not shown). however,
we observed pronounced effects of  xxxd2940xxx  in larvae as mepcs
showed twofold longer decay time constants in the presence of
the drug (fig. 3b and table 2). nonetheless, it is noteworthy
that the decay time constants measured in larvae in  xxxd2940xxx 
(mean 5 3.8 ms) did not match the embryonic control (drugfree) decay time constant (mean 5 7.2 ms). thus the activity
of ache in the synaptic cleft has only a partial role in determining the decay rates of mepcs recorded in zebrafish axial
muscles, and the transition from slow to fast mepc decay rates
cannot be attributed entirely to changes in ache activity
during development.
similar achr channels in embryonic and larval muscle cells
we hypothesized that the observed developmental alterations in mepc kinetics may also arise from changes in the
properties of achr channels during development, such as the
expression of different subunits or subtypes. to characterize
the properties of achrs, we recorded single-channel activity
from acutely dissociated muscle cells. as shown in fig. 5a1,
myocytes from 1-day-old embryos were small, spherical cells
of 10 –20 mm in diameter. muscle cells isolated from larvae
were long, fused trapezoidal cells of 20 –30 mm in diameter
and #100 mm in length (fig. 5a2). regular striations were
evident at 2-mm intervals. these dissociated cells thus appeared to retain the morphology observed in vivo (fig. 1). we

isolated muscle cells from 3-day-old larvae because cells from
older specimens were more difficult to dissociate, and the
developmental changes in mepc properties were largely complete by this time. unlike mammalian muscle fibers (brehm

nmj that could be discerned in early zebrafish muscle cells.
cell-attached recordings with 0.4 mm ach in the pipette

two types of channels (fig. 5, b1 and b2). amplitude histograms of channel openings in the experiment illustrated in fig.

and 60 ps (60.1 6 2.6 ps, n 5 27) and mean open times of ,1
ms, as described subsequently (based on all recordings presented in table 3). these events were likely due to the presence of two distinct channels (rather than subconductance
states) as patches containing one or the other type of channel
were observed in approximately one-half (15/28) of the
patches. furthermore, when two channels were present, either
one could predominate, although the 60-ps channel was seen
more frequently. occasionally other conductance levels were
observed (usually of ;20, 35, and .100 ps), but unlike the 45and 60-ps channels these proved to be insensitive to  xxxd3456xxx .
we characterized the properties of the channels in dissociated myocytes from embryos and larvae to ascertain whether
their properties changed between these stages of development.
as shown in fig. 6a, ;45-ps and (more frequently) ;60-ps

reversal potentials near 0 mv. similar conductances were

conductance in each “type of recording”). single exponential
distributions were normally observed for the open and closed
time histograms (fig. 6, b1 and b2) with means of ,1 ms and
of a few hundred milliseconds, respectively (table 3). only
occasionally (4/55 channels analyzed) were second, longer
open (;5 ms) or closed times (;400 ms) detected (as seen for
a small number of events in fig. 6, b1, b2, and c1). rather than
reflecting distinct but rarely observed second states, we believe
that these longer-lasting events were more likely due to missed
events during unresolved bursts. we conclude that these channels shared similar kinetic properties in embryos and larvae
despite their different conductances.
to ascertain that these were indeed achr channels, the
sensitivity of the channels to application of ach (0.4 mm) and
 xxxd3456xxx  (10 mm) was examined in outside-out patches
because synaptic currents were found to be abolished at this
concentration of  xxxd3456xxx , which was shown previously
to suppress neuromuscular transmission in the zebrafish (grunwald et al. 1988). as shown in fig. 7a, recordings from
outside-out patches revealed channels with properties indistinguishable from those observed in cell-attached patches (table
3) in that both 45- and 60-ps conductances with brief (,1 ms)
openings were observed. a very low, spontaneous level of
activity was observed in the absence of applied ach (control),

and as shown in fig. 7, a (ach) and b (representative of 3 such
experiments), the probability of channel opening increased
rapidly on application of ach. channel activity was completely suppressed by subsequent application of 10 mm dtubocurarine in the presence of ach [fig. 7, a (ach 1 d-tc)
and b], confirming that these channels were indeed achr
channels. furthermore, in 12 recordings from cell-attached
patches with  xxxd3456xxx  in the pipette solution, no channel
activity was observed. we conclude from these results that the
same two types of achr are present throughout the developmental stages examined.

we have observed spontaneous mepcs in zebrafish embryos
between 24 and 36 h, with slow rise times of ;2 ms and decay
times of ;7 ms. the mepc amplitudes were 10 – 80 pa (mean
12 pa). primary motoneurons start innervating the muscles at
;17 h postfertilization, the same time at which spontaneous
tail contractions are first observed (myers et al. 1986; westerfield et al. 1986). this is also the earliest time at which clusters
of achrs have been detected in living embryos by staining
with fluorescent a-bungarotoxin (liu and westerfield 1992).
thus achr clustering appears to occur within a few hours of
contact between the motoneurons and muscle cells. after
hatching, when larvae are able to swim in fast bursts (eaton
and farley 1973; kimmel et al. 1972; saint-amant and
drapeau 1998), severalfold larger and faster synaptic currents
were observed (rise times of ,0.5 ms and decay times of ,2
ms), suggesting an increased efficiency of transmission at
maturing endplates. the neuronal sources of these mepcs
cannot be unambiguously defined because of polyneuronal
innervation. the caudal primary motoneuron and numerous
secondary motoneurons innervate the lateral ventral muscle
fibers, whereas the middle primary motoneuron and secondary
motoneurons innervate the dorsal muscles (myers 1985;
westerfield et al. 1986). this polyneuronal innervation may
account for the non-gaussian distribution of mepcs recorded
at the stages we examined if different presynaptic endings
activated synaptic responses of different amplitudes. muscle
cells were extensively coupled in both embryos and larvae for
#2 wk, in contrast to the coupling between xenopus embryonic muscle cells that is lost after ;2 days (armstrong et al.
1983). this indicates that the trunk contractions during early
larval swimming are mediated by a synsytium of coupled
muscle fibers that may help minimize disparities in the extent

of nmj maturation by enhancing the overall performance of
the muscle.
two types of achr channels were detected in muscle cells
acutely dissociated from embryos, 45- and 60-ps conductance
channels with mean open times of ,1 ms. in the dissociated
muscle cells, we could not distinguish between synaptic and
extrasynaptic achrs. however, in numerous other preparations, extrasynaptic achrs appear to have properties similar to
synaptically localized achrs and provide direct information
about the latter (brehm and kullberg 1987; reviewed by edmonds et al. 1995; schuetze and role 1987). the same two
types of achr channels were observed in larvae, ruling out an
obvious transition in channel properties during maturation at
these early stages. however, more subtle changes, e.g., in
modal gating of the channels (naranjo and brehm 1993) or in
affinity for ach, may not have been detected in our experiments. in many other preparations, a switch from slow- to
fast-channel kinetics is observed during muscle maturation
(reviewed by jacobson 1991; schuetze and role 1987). a later
postnatal switch in bovine (mishina et al. 1986) and murine
(witzemann et al. 1996) achr subunit composition has been
shown to underlie the kinetic transitions in these species. thus
in most preparations it appears that postsynaptic events determine the early maturation of the nmj during the first few days
or weeks of development. in contrast, two types of achr
subtype with fast kinetics have also been observed in mice
(sheperd and brehm 1997), and chick muscle has only one
type of achr with a mean open time that remains long
(schuetze 1980). similar to these latter species, the achr
openings that we observed in zebrafish appear to remain constant (albeit brief) throughout the early developmental period
that we examined, suggesting that the channel properties may
be expressed from the onset of embryogenesis. as we did not
examine the properties of mepcs and achrs in mature animals, we cannot exclude a later change in receptor properties.
however it seems unlikely that the synaptic currents can get

much faster than those in larvae as these are already among the
fastest cholinergic responses to be reported and are close to the
limit of detection (and effectiveness).
at the low concentration (0.4 mm) of ach used here, only
single achr channel openings of ,0.5 ms in duration were
observed. at higher concentrations, bursts or clusters of openings have been observed in other preparations (reviewed by
edmonds et al. 1995; lingle et al. 1992), and their durations
appear to determine the time course of synaptic events (e.g., at
xenopus nmjs) (kullberg and owens 1986). accordingly, we
would expect several reopenings of achrs at mature synapses,
given the mean synaptic decay time constant of ;2 ms that we
observed. it is interesting to note that in xenopus (kullberg and
owens 1986) and garter snakes (dionne and parsons 1978,
1981) the mepc decay rates are related to contraction velocity.
because zebrafish larvae and adults show a high frequency
(20 – 40 hz) of contractions during swimming (liu and
westerfield 1988; saint-amant and drapeau 1998) and have
faster and more pronounced startle contractions (kimmel et al.
1972; saint-amant and drapeau 1998), we propose that the
physiological properties of the nmj (brief achr channel
openings and fast mepcs) have been optimized for these high
rates of muscle contraction.
the immature synapses recorded in embryos had time constants of decay that were threefold longer than those recorded in
larvae, suggesting prolonged channel reopenings during ach
release. the ache inhibitor  xxxd2940xxx  caused only a twofold slowing of larval mepcs and did not affect the time course of embryonic mepcs, suggesting that ache expression appears to be an
important determinant for the maturation of synaptic transmission
at nmjs but is not the only limit to mepc decay. the limited
contribution of ache to shaping mepcs may have contributed to
the non-gaussian amplitude histrograms observed both in embryos and larvae if the prolonged presence of ach in the synaptic
cleft produced broader and more variant patterns of achr activation. achr clusters increase in number and size early during

synaptogenesis (liu and westerfield 1992). together with an
increase in achr density within clusters this could account for
both the increase in mepc amplitude and kinetics. alternatively,
presynaptic differentiation may determine the development of
mature endplate properties in the zebrafish. it has been shown that
the growth cones of xenopus motoneurons in culture release ach
before contacting a muscle cell (hume et al. 1983; young and poo
1983). contact enhances the rate of release of ach (sun and poo
1987; xie and poo 1986), and the kinetics and frequency of
mepcs increase with time in culture (evers et al. 1989). these
findings with cultured cells suggest that an extended diffusion
barrier may exist at newly formed zebrafish nmjs in vivo and
may result in delayed and prolonged activation of achrs. presynaptic contact with muscle cells could culminate in tight, restricted apposition of the motor nerve terminal to the muscle cell,
and a higher density of ache would accelerate the mepc decay
rate to that observed by 3 days. regardless of the structural
changes occurring during early development of the nmj, our
results indicate that the same achrs are present in the embryo
and larva and that ache expression is not the only limit to
maturation of the mepc.
