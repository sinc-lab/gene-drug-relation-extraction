retinoids:
in vitro interaction
and influence
on plasma

with
retinal

retinol-binding

studies
have been conducted
to investigate the structure-function
relationships
of retinoids in
their in vitro interaction
with plasma retinol-binding
protein (rbp) and in their influence on plasma retinol
concentration.
two classes of retinoids,
one bearing
modifications
in the area of the retinol hydroxyl
end
group ( xxxd2099xxx ,
n-(ethyl)
retinamide,
au-trans,
and
13-cis retinoic
acid) and the other one also bearing
modifications
in the area of the cyclohexene
ring
( xxxd2071xxx ,
 xxxd71xxx , and arotinoid  xxxd1058xxx ), were investigated.
whereas
substantial
modifications
of the
retinol
hydroxyl
group do not prevent the binding
to
rbp, an intact trimethylcyclohexenyl
group seems to be
crucial
for binding.
both classes of retinoids,
administered orally at equimolar
doses, reduce plasma retinol
concentration
in rats but with different
kinetics.
a
marked lowering of plasma retinol occurs early (within
5 h) after administration
of retinoids that interact with
rbp in vitro, whereas it occurs at later times (24 h) after
retinoids that do not interact with rbp. the concentrations of both classes of retinoids found in plasma do not
account for the temporal difference
in this effect. the
early reduction
of plasma retinol might be the consequence of in vivo specific binding of retinoids to rbp, as
suggested by the in vitro results. the late reduction observed for retinoids lacking in vitro affinity for rbp is
due to other mechanisms
or to metabolism
to retinoids
binding
to rbp.berni, r., clerici, m., malpeli, g.,

retinol

the
/wloprotein
is normally
associated
in plasma
with
thyroxine-binding
transthyretin
(55 kda) in a 1:1 molar
ratio. the physiological
role of the rbp-transthyretin
complex is believed
to be the prevention
of filtration
through
renal glomeruli
of the relatively
small rbp molecule
(8).
moreover,
the association
of rbp with transthyretin
increases
the stability
of the retinol-rbp
complex (9). upon
delivery
of retinol
to target
cells (10, 11), the resulting
aporbp (i.e., the carrier protein devoid of its ligand) substantially loses its affinity for transthyretin
and thus can be readily filtered in the uncomplexed
form through
renal glomeruli
(3).
the crystal structures of holo and aporbp have been determined
at high resolution
(12-14).
the retinol-binding
site
of rbp, deprived of the natural ligand, binds many retinoids
(9, 15, 16).  xxxd2099xxx ,
a retinoid
that is being tested as a

patients

(17), also

forms a tight complex
with aporbp,
and such a complex
lacks affinity for transthyretin
(18). these binding
properties
observed
in vitro have been associated
with the remarkable
early reduction
in plasma retinol levels, which is induced
by
 xxxd2099xxx 
both in humans
and in rats (17, 18). recent
studies
show that  xxxd2099xxx 
substantially
blocks the secretion of retinol and rbp into the circulation
(19).
after these observations,
the question
arises as to the possible interaction
of other retinoids
with rbp and their eventual interference
with retinol metabolism.
the aims of this
work were to gain more insight
into the structural
requirements for the interaction
of retinoids
with rbp and to establish whether
a relationship
exists between
their in vitro
affinity for the carrier protein
and their influence
on plasma
retinol.

holorbp was purified from fresh plasma as described (20). the

using the following procedure.
the solution of
holorbp (10 em in 20 mm tris-hci, ph 7.3) was thoroughly mixed with
two volumes of  xxxd2052xxx  at 2#{176}c
for 20 mm, and the  xxxd2052xxx  phase was
separated.
this step was repeated three times. finally, the  xxxd2052xxx  remaining in the aqueous solution was evaporated
under vacuum. after this
treatment the protein was completely devoid of retinol, as shown by the lack

rbp consists of a single polypeptide
chain of approximately 21 kda, which is synthesized
and secreted
primarily
by the hepatocytes
as the retinol-rbp

(holorbp).

female sprague-dawley rats (150-170 g) (charles river, calco, italy) were
treated orally by intubation with a single administration
of retinoids suspended in sesame oil. the doses chosen were 0.05 and 0.4 mmol/kg, which
correspond to about 20 and 160mg of each retinoid per kilogram of rat body
weight and to 122 and 976 mg/m2, respectively (24). n-(ethyl) retinamide
was tested only at the lower dose. control rats received sesame oil. three
rats per group were used. blood, drawn from the retroorbital
plexus of
anesthetized
rats before and at 5 and 24 h after treatment, was collected into
heparinized
tubes and wrapped in aluminium
foil in order to protect it from
light. retinal and drug concentrations
in plasma were assayed by reversedphase hplc
as previously
described
(17). detection
was performed
at
340 nm, which allows a good sensitivity for both retinol and the chosen retinoids in each plasma sample. the concentrations
of the different retinoids
were evaluated by comparing
the peak areas in the samples with those from
reference standard curves set up for each retinoid in plasma.

were
monitored by following the quenching of protein fluorescence, which is associated with retinoid binding to the apoprotein and results from an efficient
energy transfer to the bound retinoid (16). aliquots (0.2-i pl) of concentrated ethanolic solutions of retinoids were added to the spectrofluorometer
cuvette containing aporbp (0.35 m) in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m
naci, ph 7. after each addition the protein solution was gently stirred and
allowed to equilibrate
in the dark for the time required to obtain a substantially constant fluorescence
signal (about 10 mm). a negligible inner filter
effect by added retinoids was found under our experimental
conditions,
and
therefore no correction
for such an effect was made. binding data were analyzed according to the method of cogan et al. (16).
binding experiments
with  xxxd2099xxx 
and all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  competing
for binding to rep with all-trans retinal were also performed. the two synthetic retinoids are essentially nonfluorescent
under our experimental
conditions, both in the free and the bound form. on the contrary, retinol is highly
fluorescent when bound to rbp. thus, displacements of the bound retinol
by the two retinoids and of the bound retinoids by retinal can be monitored
by following the decrease and increase of retinol fluorescence,
respectively.
as for the competition
of retinoids with bound retinol,  xxxd2099xxx 
(2 sm),
or  xxxd3417xxx  (2 aim) were incubated
with native retinol-rbp
(1 sm) in
0.05 m sodium phosphate,
0.15 m naci, ph 7, at 20#{176}c
for 1 h. fluorescence readings were then taken. in the case of the reverse of the above experiment, aporbp (1.1 sm) was first incubated with  xxxd2099xxx  (2 sm) or
 xxxd3417xxx  (2 m) in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m naci, ph 7, at
20#{176}c

complexes. retinol (2 im) was then incubated with preformed

these binding

also found for bovine rbp (data not shown),

they can be assumed
to be similar

ring in the binding to rbp. its substitution
by a variety of
groups may not be an impediment
to the binding to the carrier protein, provided that conformational
changes involving
the above loops take place. such changes are likely to occur,
due to the flexibility of the protein main chain in that area
(12-14). further, those changes might be responsible
for the
reduced or null affinity of retinoid-rbp
complexes for transthyretin
that was established
in previous
studies (7, 18, 21,
26). this hypothesis
is consistent
with the observation
that
one of the above loops undergoes
a conformational
change
on removal
of retinol
from the holoprotein
(13, 14), which

specifically
interact
with the carrier
protein.
the rbp
retinol-binding
site consists of an eight-stranded
fl-barrel
that completely
encapsulates
the retinol molecule (12-14).
the retinol cyclohexene ring is lodged deeply inside the
barrel cavity, whereas the hydroxyl end group points toward
the solvent.
a schematic
representation
of the threedimensional
structure of /zolorbp with the retinol molecule
bound inside the fl-barrel cavity is shown in fig. 6.
the available structural
information
on the rbp retinolbinding site may account for the structural requirements
for
the interaction
of retinoids with rbp. we have shown here
that an intact trimethylcyclohexenyl
group may be crucial for
the interaction
of retinoids with rbp, presumably
as a consequence of its close contacts with side chains in the fl-barrel

fi-

cavity (12-14).
in fact, conformational
tein, presumably
incompatible
with

changes
of the prothe rigidity
of the fi-

barrel (13, 14), would be required
to accommodate

analog of  xxxd3417xxx  modified
in the area of the cyclohexene ring, which at variance with the binding properties of the
natural retinoid lacks affinity for rbp.
the retinol hydroxyl end group is positioned almost at the
protein
surface
in holorbp
in the region comprising
the
loops that surround the opening of the fl-barrel (fig. 6), and
as shown by the results of these and previous
studies (3, 16),
it does not play a role as important
as that of the cyclohexene

leads

to a low affinity

interference

of aporbp

with the recognition

for transthyretin

between

(3). the

rbp

and trans-

thyretin
is a particularly
relevant
issue, as it might be associated
with some of the effects exerted
in vivo by synthetic
retinoids
(see below).
we have shown that retinoids
capable
of interacting
with

tween rbp and transthyretin,

rather than between rbp and

receptors,
might be a prerequisite
for rbp secretion.
results provide
indirect
evidence
for this hypothesis.
in
the inhibition
of rbp and retinol secretion
by retinoids
are capable
of interacting
with rbp, and at the same

interfere with the recognition

between

our
fact,
that
time

rbp and transthyre-

rbp induce an early reduction of plasma retinol. this effect
might be due to two possible mechanisms.
first, a competition between such retinoids and retinol for the rbp retinol-

tin in vitro (7, 18, 21, 26), is consistent
with the involvement
of the rbp-transthyretin
complex
in rbp secretion.
similarly, aporbp
is poorly secreted,
being accumulated
inside

binding
site might occur in plasma,
thus leading
to an impaired plasma
transport
of rbp and retinol.
however,
some
observations
tend to exclude such a mechanism:
1) according
to our in vitro studies,
synthetic
retinoids
( xxxd2099xxx 
and
all-trans
retinoic
acid) do not considerably
displace
retinol
from the retinol-rbp
complex;
2) retinoic
acid administered
to rats was found in plasma
associated
with  xxxg124xxx 
rather
than rbp (27); 3) no acceleration
of the removal
of
retinol
and rbp from the circulation
was observed
upon
treatment
of rats with  xxxd2099xxx 
(19). second,
a competition between
retinoids
and retinol might take place in secretory cells and be responsible
for a depressed
secretion
of

the endoplasmic
reticulum
of retinol-deficient
hepatocytes,
and at the same time, it exhibits a low affinity for transthyre-

rbp and retinol into the plasma. some evidence in accordance with this hypothesis has been presented.
smith et al.
(19) have shown that  xxxd2099xxx 
administered
to rats drastically inhibits the secretion
of rbp and retinol into the circulation.
it has also been
suggested
that the reduction
of
plasma
retinol
in rats treated
with all-trans retinoic
acid is
similarly
dependent
on an interference
with rbp secretion

(6). finally,

we have shown that the binding

noids to apo-rbp
in vitro is not

at the same concentration

of synthetic

substantially
as compared
to correlate

reti-

reversed
by
to the retiwith results

obtained
in vivo. in fact, the concentrations
of both  xxxd2099xxx  (f. formelli et al., unpublished
observations)
and
all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  (28) attained
at early times in the liver
of rats
enough

treated
with high doses of these compounds
to suggest an effective competition
between

and retinol

for the retinol

binding

site of unliganded

retinoids

rbp.

at early times  xxxd2071xxx 
reached concentrations
in the liver
even higher than those of  xxxd2099xxx 
(e formelli et al., unpublished observations),
but presumably
owing to the inability
of
this retinoid
to interact
with rbp, no substantial
effect on
plasma retinol was observed.
however,  xxxd2071xxx ,
arotinoid
rn
13-7410, and to a minor extent,  xxxd71xxx ,
quite unexpectedly
caused a loring
of plasma retinol concentration
at later times
as compared
to the class of retinoids
that interact with rbp in
vitro. the generation
of numerous
metabolites
(as established
in

the case of  xxxd2071xxx ;

f. formelli,

et al., unpublished

observa-

tions) eventually
competent
to bind to rbp might account for
the delayed effect. if that is the case, the mechanism
by which
the latter class of retinoids
lowers plasma retinol also involves
an interaction,
although not direct, with rbp. another plausible
explanation
of the late reduction
of plasma retinol induced
by
the aforementioned
compounds
is that they might interfere with
enzymatic
activities associated
with  xxxd3105xxx  metabolism
(ref
29, and references
therein).
regarding
the regulation
of rbp and retinol concentrations in plasma,
it is known that the secretion
of rbp from
the liver, as well as from cultured
liver cells, is strictly dependent on the availability
of retinol
(30, 31). to explain
the
effector role of retinol in the rbp secretion process,
it has

been suggested that a ligand-induced
protein conformational
change might be crucial for rbp secretion (6). such a
change might be necessary for the recognition,
in the endoplasmic reticulum,
between rbp and receptors or other
specific membrane
proteins involved in the cell sorting of
proteins (6). on the other hand, intracellular
recognition be-

and

tin (3). the role of retinol in rbp secretion
might just
that of favoring,
after its binding
to rbp, the formation
the endoplasmic
reticulum
of a tight holorbp-transthyretin

complex,

which

would

then be secreted.

perimental

that certain

our hypothesis.
retinoids
mimicked
retinol

it
in

from retinol-deficient

h4ii ec3

rat hepatoma
cells in culture,
whereas
other retinoids
were
ineffective
(32). however,
the results of the studies with cultured cells may not correlate
with the in vivo effects of the
retinoids.
notable
is the case of all-trans  xxxd3417xxx . this
retinoid
effectively
stimulated
the secretion
of rbp from
retinol-deficient
h411 ec3 cells (32) and from primary
hepatocytes
as well (33), but was completely
inactive in
stimulating
the secretion
of rbp from the liver of retinol
deficient
rats (30). it is also worth recalling
the behavior
of
hepg2 human
hepatoma
cells in culture.
such cells secrete
little if any transthyretin,
yet produce
and secrete significant
quantities
of rbp even in the absence
of retinol
(34).

finally,

the remarkable

influence

of retinoids

on plasma

retinol may have relevant
clinical implications.
in fact, even
if for some retinoids
the doses that we have tested in rats are

higher

than those actually

used in the clinic, due to the en-

couraging
results
obtained
with some retinoids
in cancer
therapy
(2), studies
are actually
being conducted
with increasing
doses of these
retinoids.
thus,
a reduction
in
plasma
retinol might also occur in humans when high doses
of these compounds
are administered.
the authors are grateful to dr. g. zanotti for helpful discussions
and for preparing
a schematic representation
of the rbp threedimensional
structure.
