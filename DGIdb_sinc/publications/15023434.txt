summary anti-cd20 antibodies radiolabeled with i-131  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar) or
y-90- xxxd2312xxx  (zevalin), are similarly efficacious in treating chemotherapy-refractory non-hodgkin’s lymphoma. the relative merits of both radioimmunoconjugates with respect to practical issues, including radiation exposure risk,
the advantages and disadvantages of the respective isotopes and other parameters
that could affect a patient’s quality of life are also important. i-131-labeled antibody
treatment often requires inpatient hospitalization due to the inherent risk of
exposure from gamma emissions, and patients and families should follow detailed
instructions to prevent undue exposure. other issues relevant to patients and
medical staff include: (1) the need for dosimetry to calculate effective therapeutic
doses of i-131-labeled anti-b1 (bexxar) compared with the lack of correlation of
dosimetry with marrow toxicity for  xxxd2312xxx  (zevalin), (2) determining the acute
and long-term toxic effects of each agent, (3) time commitments for nuclear
medicine staff and patients along with the relative ease of administration, and (4)
cost considerations. a more challenging future issue will be to determine the optimal
use of bexxar and zevalin alone and in combination in ways that will significantly
affect patient outcome without compromising quality of life. the recent demonstration of significant response rates in patients having chemotherapy-refractory
non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl) using both on i-131- and y-90-labeled anti-cd20
antibodies with minimal toxicity has stimulated comparison of i-131  xxxd3405xxx 
(bexxar) and  xxxd2312xxx  (zevalin) in terms of radiation safety requirements, the advantages and disadvantages of both radionuclides, and quality-of-life
(qol) issues. therefore, in this review, we attempt to compare the relative merits of
(bexxar and zevalin) and address important practical considerations that may
influence patient and physician choices regarding treatment using these agents.

i-131 radiation protection issues
precautions taken for therapies involving i-131 and
for radiation protection purposes in general are
aimed at two general objectives: (1) protecting the
patient, and (2) protecting the people close to the
patient. these goals involve different sets of clinical considerations and, correspondingly, different
measures that should be taken by the nuclear
medicine staff.
with i-131 in particular, protecting a patient
largely means to protect his or her thyroid gland.
this i-131 nuclide gives rise to substantial beta
emission at an energy of 69, 87, 97, 192, and 283
kev as it decays to i-131 xe with a half-life of 8.04
days. less important to patient dosimetry but relevant to calculating radiation exposure to people
who will be physically close to the patient following administration of the radiopharmaceutical, i131 also emits gamma rays, with the principal
photon emission having an energy of 364 kev.
when administering treatment to a patient using
an i-131 containing radiopharmaceutical, traditionally there have been two theoretical concerns
providing an impetus for thyroid protection. one is
the prevention of hypothyroidism while the other
is the possibility of inducing cancer in the thyroid.
the latter concern has turned out not to be a
problem of practical importance,1;2 probably because the thyroid is so sensitive to destruction via
beta emission that a radiation dose that would lead
to a significantly increased risk of cancer, would
have already ablated the thyroid gland.3 a more
general question has been raised about other secondary cancers. the clearest data exist for leukemia. with the total doses of i-131 that are
administered in the treatment of thyroid cancer,
the lifetime incidence of leukemia has been reported to increase by 2.5-fold (from 0.2% to 0.5%)
to as much as 50-fold (from 0.03% to 1.60%) above
baseline levels. on the other hand, at i-131 doses
that patients typically receive in diagnostic studies
or low-level therapeutic administration (e.g., for
treatment of hyperthyroidism), increased risk of
leukemia has not been documented.1–3
thyroid protection is accomplished through oral
administration of one of two common agents. one
is supersaturated  xxxd2375xxx  which is commonly referred to as  xxxd2375xxx  (although that acronym is
a registered trademark of upsher-smith labs,
minneapolis, mn) the other agent used for thyroid
protection is lugol’s solution, which is also known
as strong  xxxd2375xxx . this agent actually contains both iodine and  xxxd2375xxx  in solution.
when used for protecting the thyroid from irradi-

d.h. silverman et al.
ation, administration of thyroid blocking agent
beginning 1 day before and continuing for 1–2
weeks after administration of the isotope is recommended. there have been some systematic
studies examining how well founded these prescribed time ranges are. for example, it has been
shown that initiating protective therapy 7 days
before radioiodine administration affords no extra
protection when compared with initiating it 1 day
before administration. typically, patients receive
protective regimens for 10–14 days depending on
how long the radioiodine is expected to remain in
their circulation.
with respect specifically to protecting the thyroid from i-131 that is conjugated with an antibody
directed against the b-cell antigen cd20, most of
the published data have come from the work of
wahl and his colleagues.4 a standard protocol that
they have employed is administration of 2 gtt of
 xxxd2375xxx  both 1 day before initiation of therapy and
t.i.d. for 2 weeks after administration of the dosimetric dose (5 mci) of i-131-conjugated antibody.
in addition, 200 mg of potassium perchlorate p.o.
t.i.d. is administered starting on the first day of the
antibody dose, and continuing for a week thereafter. the same protection regimen is repeated at
the time of administration of the therapeutic dose.
thus, a patient who receives a dosimetric antibody
dose and then within 14 days receives a therapeutic
dose will require about 1 month of continuous
protective  xxxd2375xxx  dosing t.i.d.;  xxxd2375xxx  will be combined
with potassium perchlorate for about half of those
days.
the other major radiation protection issue concerns exposure to people surrounding the patient.
this encompasses the nuclear medicine staff, nurses who care for in patients receiving irradiation,
and household contacts of patients following their
release from the facility where the radiation dose
is administered. how much exposure will these
people receive by being near the patient? detailed
calculations have been published, and some formulas have been derived that substantially simplify
the process of estimating maximum likely exposure.3 administered therapeutic doses generally
range from 50 to 160 mci, (usually about 100 mci)
with the aim of delivering a total body dose to the
patient of 65–75 cgy. at these doses, reported
doses emitted from patients have ranged from 8 to
23 mrem/h at a distance of 1 m, typically approximating 12 mrem/h. also, total body residence
times have ranged from 40 to 130 h; this variability
is reduced when dosimetric examination is restricted to only those patients who have received
the dosimetric and therapeutic radiation doses in

radiolabeled antibody therapy in non-hodgkins lymphoma
the manner in which they are now clinically given:
following preadministration of an unlabeled antibody. the mean residence time is about 100 h,
based on a monoexponential fit of three data
points expressible as percent injected dose: one
measured at the time of dosing, one measured
shortly after voiding, and one measured 6–7 days
after the initial dose. dose measurements can be
obtained using a probe, although for reasons of
convenience they are often acquired using a gamma camera that is capable of imaging. the practical meaning of these measurements is as follows:
given a mean emission rate of 12 mrem/h and total
body residence time of 100 h, someone 1 m away
from the patient continually from the time of administration will be exposed to 1200 mrem of excess radiation.
of course, nobody will actually remain 1 m away
from a patient continually, or even for 24 h per day
over a few days, so other factors must be entered
into even the simplest of radiation exposure formulas. one element that contributes to this adjustment is the so-called ‘occupancy factor.’ the
default occupancy factor value recommended by
the us national regulatory commission (nrc),
barring other factors regarding the patient’s lifestyle that suggest a different value, is 0.25. an
unadjusted projection of maximum exposure of
1200 mrem thus falls to approximately 300 mrem.
another element is that for the first several hours
after a dose is administered, voiding may not occur. this should be accounted for by including a
factor that will increase the overall estimate based
on how long after dose administration the first
voiding is estimated to occur and the amount of
time people will be close to the patient during
those first few hours. the parameters suggested by
siegel,5 which are based on practical experience,
are that first voiding occurs at 3 h after administration, and that an initial occupancy factor of 0.75
is assumed during this period. this leads to a calculation of maximal dose exposure of contacts (in
mrem) using the following equation: mrem/h at
release  (8.94 [prevoid factor] + 0.99 [residence
time])  0.25 (occupancy factor). this is a very
simple formula that will allow facile calculation of
potential radiation exposure to individuals close to
patients. it is clear that, relative to a residence
time of 100 h, the prevoid factor of 8.94 adds little
to the estimated exposure. however, it may have a
significant impact on the estimate of exposure to
hospital staff who are particularly at risk for exposure during the first few hours after administration of the dose. the patient must be given written
instructions prior to discharge. once understood,
these instructions are relatively simple for some-

167

one in a normal functional state to follow. the
nuclear medicine physician and oncologist should
assess whether patients are likely to be able to
follow directions and comply with them in terms of
limiting their exposure to other people, e.g.,
maintaining the specified physical distance from
household contacts, flushing the toilet multiple
times after each use, etc.
in comparison, an advantage of y-90 over i-131 is
the absence of exposure precautions due to a relative lack of gamma emission. however, care must
be taken to avoid direct contact of y-90 with skin
or surface areas. long-term radiation side effects
(i.e., leukemia) are also important considerations
(see below).

comparison of i-131 and y-90 in the
treatment of nhl
table 1 shows the putative advantages and disadvantages of i-131 and y-90 in the treatment of nhl.
both practical and theoretical differences are
considered in this comparison. as a general rule,
both the radiation dose rate and total dose delivered to the tumor may affect the outcome of
radiotherapy.6 at a low dose rates (measured in
rads/h) a higher cumulative dose would be required
for a similar biological effect similar to that of
higher dose rates. in the majority of solid tumors,
it is conceivable that y-90 could generate a dose
rate up to 10 times higher than that generated by i131 due to its higher beta energy and shorter halflife.7;8 this theoretical advantage assumes that
there are no differences in antibody uptake by tumors and no alterations in antibody clearance
based on the stability of the radiolabel.
because y-90 has a greater beta energy (2.3
mev) and longer path length (5–10 mm) than i-131
does (0.8 mev and 1–2 mm, respectively), it may
be the preferred radionuclide in treating large tumors accompanied by areas of necrosis, which requires tumor-cell sterilization through a “crossfire”
effect from neighboring cells that have been targeted by antibodies.9 preclinical studies using an
experimental lymphoma model have confirmed this
hypothesis.10 this crossfire effect may be lost,
however, as the tumor mass decreases, which
could result in treatment effects similar to those of
short-range beta emitters such as i-131. in essence,
nhl tumors less than 1 cm in diameter or with
micrometastases (such as those that may be present after autologous bone marrow transplantation)
might be more effectively treated using i-131-labeled antibodies with the attendant theoretical

the radiobiological and other unique characteristics of nhl make it likely that treatment of it
using anti-cd20 antibodies coupled with y-90 or
i-131 would be effective. first, nhl is inherently
radiosensitive and therefore may respond to a low
constant cumulative dose rate resulting from the
prolonged half-life and lower beta energy of i-131
coupled with the whole-body effects of gamma
radiation. second, the high level of expression in
cd20 on the majority of lymphoma cells11 may
decrease the need for sterilization of antigennegative tumor cells through radiation crossfire.
moreover, in clinical practice, response rates in
patients who received i-131-labeled anti-b1 for
bulky tumors (>500 g) and smaller tumors were
similar because each patient received the amount
of i-131 calculated to deliver the maximum wholebody dose to the tumor.12 lastly, press et al.13
demonstrated that y-90 and i-131 could have similar activities in tumor cells in vitro provided the
antigen-antibody complex is not internalized. because cd20 does not modulate, internalization
with subsequent dehalogenation of i-131 should not
occur.
practical considerations may also favor one isotope over the other. for instance the lack of significant gamma emission from y-90 poses a lower
radiation risk to hospital personnel and allows for

although the revised nrc guidelines for outpatient
use of higher activities should allow for outpatient
management with close follow-up in many circumstances. advantages of i-131 over y-90 include
lower expense and greater availability and ease in
antibody labeling. one disadvantage, however, is
that i-131 conjugates may undergo dehalogenation
in vivo, resulting in variation in dose delivery to
tumor and normal tissues and requiring dosimetry
up front to predict marrow and organ toxicity.
y-90, on the other hand, requires complex chelation chemistry for antibody labeling. the shorter
half-life of  xxxd2312xxx  (zevalin) compared to with
that of i-131-labeled anti-b1 (bexxar) could necessitate on site labeling with the inherent risk of
poor quality control when compared with a central
labeling facility.14 furthermore, unstable chelation
can result in bone marrow toxicity due to targeting
free y-90 to bone.15 parameters such as antibody
affinity, tumor blood flow, antigen heterogeneity,
and tumor size can alter the amount of specific
targeting of both radionuclides as well.16

quality of life issues: y-90 vs. i-131
direct comparisons of labeled antib with  xxxd2312xxx 
should also focus on certain parameters that could
effect the patient qol and compliance. although

radiolabeled antibody therapy in non-hodgkins lymphoma
some of these parameters are difficult to quantify,
there are several issues that deserve attention: (1)
the relative acute and chronic toxic effects of the
two products, (2) inpatient vs. outpatient treatment, (3) ease of administration and time commitments for patients, and (4) cost considerations.

toxicity
in 1996, kaminiski et al.17 published data on the
short- and long-term side effects of i-131-labeled
anti-b1; these data were recently updated.4 as
shown in table 2, the most common immediate
side effects of administration of i-131- and y-90labeled antibodies were fever, chills, fatigue, and
nausea. y-90 appeared to produce a slightly higher
incidence of chills, fatigue, and nausea; whether
this represents truly significant differences in toxicity rather than small variations in toxicity reporting is unknown. the side effects were mild and
transient and did not significantly affect overall
qol. additionally, comparison of hematological
toxic effects revealed no significant differences in
mean/median platelet or white blood cell count
nadirs or duration of cytopenia. moreover, the
number of infections and required transfusions
were similar (data not shown.)
in addition, the human anti-mouse antibody
(hama) incidence was 12% (4/34) with i-131-labeled anti-b1 compared with a hama/human antichimeric antibody (haca) incidence of 2% with
 xxxd2312xxx . these differences were small, though
the slightly increased incidence of hama with antib1 compared with  xxxd2312xxx  could have been due

169

to the use of several doses of the former but a
single dose of the latter. moreover, the higher incidence of hama with anti-b1 could be due to the
fact that the bexxar protocol uses high amounts of
the same murine antibody in unlabeled form for
pretargeting, whereas the zevalin protocol uses
the chimeric antibody, rituxan, for pretargeting.
despite these small differences, there were no
adverse sequelae due the presence of hama/haca
in any of the patients. also, there was a similar
frequency of acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (1% with  xxxd2312xxx , 2.9% with i-131-labeled
anti-cd20) which developed 6 months to 2 years

patients who undergo heavy pretreatment using
alkylating agents with or without radiation.
in summary, acute and chronic side effects were
infrequent, equivalent with both agents, and did
not significantly affect qol. in fact, most of the
patients reported that radioimmunotherapy was
much more tolerable than chemotherapy.
inpatient vs. outpatient treatment
until recent policies of the nrc allowed treatment
using i-131 at higher activities in an outpatient
setting (under some restrictions), i-131-labeled
anti-b1 administration occurred in inpatient settings only with careful attention paid to monitoring
of gamma radiation exposure rates. stajduhar
et al.18 recently published data on the experiences
and educational needs of patients receiving i-131
therapy for thyroid cancer on an inpatient basis. in
their study, taped interviews with patients resulted

d.h. silverman et al.
in the following findings: (1) most of the patients
experienced profound isolation during treatment,
(2) many patients had treatment-related fears that
were compounded by the reluctance of nurses and
hospital personnel to enter their rooms, (3) patients complained about the use of physical restraints and lack of environmentally friendly
facilities in their rooms, and (4) the majority of the
patients complained of a lack of understanding of
and education on the proposed treatment. thus,
following solutions were proposed: (1) a pretreatment, preadmission patient/family program should
be developed; (2) a comprehensive staff education
program should be initiated in conjunction with
that for patients and other members of the health
care team and (3) inpatient rooms should be made
more environmentally friendly (i.e., include small
refrigerators and other amenities).
since similar data which evaluates qol in rit for
y-90 have not been forthcoming, and qol data for

patients with thyroid cancer cannot be directly
compared to the situation of lymphoma patients
where alternative treatments would most likely be
chemotherapy, these data should be considered
speculative. nevertheless, outpatient-based administration of zevalin may have a definite advantage compared to bexxaar. even if i-131 can be
administered at an activity of 75 cgy, close monitoring and patient follow-up could affect patient
compliance and overall qol. obviously, other data
should be generated in this area.

nhl and have similar toxicity profiles. it is more
than likely that each agent would complement the
other depending on the circumstances of its use,
i.e., zevalin may be used initially for bulky tumors, while bexxar may be used to treat micrometastases or minimal residual disease. many
more studies are needed to determine the utility
of each agent in combination with chemotherapy,
in the transplant setting, and for different subtypes of nhl.

ease of administration and time commitments
for patients
intravenous administration of both zevalin and
bexxar is relatively straightforward. patients who
received bexxar should undergo diagnostic scanning for activity quantitation (dosimetry) for the
purpose of predicting toxic effects in the marrow
and other organs (fig. 1), whereas studies of zevalin have demonstrated that dosimetry is not predictive of hematological toxicity.19 whole-body
imaging with the administration of in-111 y2b8 is
required by the us food and drug administration to
document satisfactory targeting (fig. 2). in the
case of bexxar, whole-body scans and clearance
measurements are needed with the use of i-131labeled anti-b1 to maximize the radiation dose per
individual patient, making for a greater learning
curve and greater time commitment for nuclear
medicine physicians when compared with zevalin.
disregarding the need for a license to handle radionuclides, zevalin could just as easily be administered by a medical oncologist following
preparation by a nuclear pharmacist. in essence,
the time commitments for both patients and physicians may be more favorable with zevalin than
with bexxar. whether this affects marketing
strategies remains to be seen.

acknowledgements

cost considerations
at this time comparative cost estimates for treatment using bexxar and zevalin are only speculative. however, given their similar treatment
efficacy and identical toxicity, a difference in cost
differences between the two agents might affect
patient satisfaction depending on the willingness of
insurance companies to reimburse these costs. this
may be a non-issue in the future.

conclusions
in summary, both bexxar and zevalin have been
shown to be highly effective in the treatment of
