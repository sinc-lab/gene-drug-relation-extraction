the presence of  xxxd2041xxx  binding protein (embp), a 54 kd
cytosolic glycoprotein, which is distinct from the estrogen
receptor, was investigated in a pilot study of primary malignant
melanomas and their metastases. in 11 primary melanomas
embp was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. the per-
centage of positive melanoma cells ranged between 11-91%
with a mean of 57%. radioimmunoassay on metastatic tissue
revealed significant amounts of embp, with values ranging
between 0.6—4.2 with a mean of 1.6 ng/mg protein. a high
number of cells with a positive stain for embp in the primary
tumours was significantly correlated to a short interval be-
tween diagnosis and the occurrence of metastases. presence
of embp in malignant melanoma may have prognostic signifi-
cance and the role of hormone-linked cytostatic drugs in the
treatment of this disease needs further investigation.

key words:  xxxd2041xxx  binding protein, hormone-linked
cytostatics, malignant melanoma.

introduction

 xxxd2041xxx , a complex between estradiol-17b and nor-
nitrogen mustard, is used in the treatment of advanced
prostatic carcinoma.'? the mechanisms of  xxxd2041xxx 
cytotoxicity in malignant tumours are incompletely under-
stood, but the presence of a specific  xxxd2041xxx  binding
protein (embp) is important for the effect.? embp, a 54 kd
cytosolic glycoprotein, which is distinct from the estrogen
receptor, binds  xxxd2041xxx  and the main metabolite,
estromustine, with high affinity and thus facilitates the
accumulation and retention of  xxxd2041xxx  in malignant
target tissue.* the presence of embp in prostatic tissue
cytosol from rat and man is well established.** embp has
been demonstrated also in human malignancies such as
breast cancer,’ pancreatic cancer,® lung cancer’ and malig-
nant glioma.”® there is also a report on the presence of
embp in malignant melanoma."' the aim of the present
study was to further investigate the presence of embp in
primary malignant melanomas and their metastases.

materials and methods
subjects and tissues samples

twelve patients with metastatic malignant melanoma were
investigated (table 1). specimens from ten lymph node
and two subcutaneous metastases were collected during
surgery, immediately frozen and stored at —70°c until
assayed. paraffin embedded material was obtained from 11
of the corresponding primary tumours. in the twelfth case,
which presented with a lymph node metastasis, no primary
tumour was found (patient 9, table 1). data on histological
type, level of invasion according to clark,’? tumour thick-
ness according to breslow," time from diagnosis to the
occurrence of lymph node or cutaneous metastasis and
survival were obtained from the medical records.

immunohistochemical demonstration of embp in
primary tumours

paraffin embedded material from primary tumours was cut
in 4 mm sections and the paraffin was removed by immer-
sion in distilled water and xylene overnight, followed by
alcohol extraction. the cells were then analysed for the
presence of embp using a conventional indirect antibody-
peroxidase technique previously described.'*'* briefly,
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by addition of
0.5 ml 30% h,o, in 50 ml methanol. the primary mouse
monoclonal antibody (mab embp 1, pharmacia leo thera-
peutics ab, helsingborg, sweden) raised against purified
rat embp and with demonstrated cross-reactivity to human
embp® was added to the sections for 30 min-1 h. after
sequential washing in phosphate buffered saline rabbit
anti-mouse avidin-biotin peroxidase—antiperoxidase com-
plex (vectastain, burlingame, ca, usa) was added. the
staining reaction was developed in dimethyl sulphoxide/
ethyl carbozole, followed by counterstaining with
haematoxylin and mounting in glycerol-gelatin. specimens

tested sample, a negative control was obtained by omitting
the primary monoclonal antibody. for each section a mini-
mum of 200 cells were counted and the number of cells
positive for cytosolic staining recorded.

preparation of cytosol

metastatic tissues were homogenized in buffer (8.9 g
na,hpo,, 3.72 edta-na,, 22 bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
4.68 g nacl per 100 ml of solution; ph 7.4) with a mechani-
cal homogenizer (ultra turrax, model tp 18/10) during
four 5-second intervals at 75% of maximal speed and with
20-second cooling intervals (on ice). the homogenate was
centrifuged for 20 min at 2,000xg and 4°c, and the
supernatant was collected.

radioimmunoassay for embp in metastases

radioimmunoassays were performed as previously de-
scribed.*"° polyclonal rabbit antiserum and_ purified rat
embp were supplied (pharmacia-leo therapeutics ab,
helsingborg, sweden). radio iodination was performed by
the chloramine-t technique,” and the specific radioactivity
obtained ranged between 50 and 100 mci/mg protein.
before use the antiserum was diluted 1:5,000. a standard
curve using 5—1,000 ng/ml of pure embp was established.
tracer and antiserum were mixed with 100ml! of
test sample and incubated at room temperature for 2h.
sheep anti-rabbit-gammaglobulin-coated particles (dasp,

402 = melanoma research + vol 4 + 1994

organon nv, oss, holland) were added for separation of
free and bound antigen and tubes were slowly rotated
overnight. samples were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 3 min,
washed three times in saline and bound radioactivity was
counted in a gamma counter. protein determination was
carried out according to lowry et al." using bovine serum
albumin as standard.

illustrates the intense cytoplasmatic staining in a nodular
melanoma from patient 2. the percentage of positive
melanoma cells in the 11 tumour samples ranged between
11 and 91% with a mean of 57% (table 1). there were no
apparent differences in embp expression with respect to
gender, histological type, level of invasion or tumour thick-
ness. within 5 years after diagnosis six of the 12 patients
had died from their melanoma disease. the interval from
diagnosis to first recurrence ranged between 12 and 91
months with a mean of 39 months. there was a significant
inverse correlation (r, —0.636; p < 0.05) between the per-
centage of cells with a positive embp stain in the primary

discussion

embp was first described as a quantitatively important
protein in the rat ventral prostate with high affinity binding
properties for  xxxd2041xxx .* human analogues to this pro-
tein with similar functional and immunochemical character-
istics have been demonstrated in different normal and
malignant tissues.'! its presence also in malignant
melanoma, previously indicated in two individual cases,"!
was confirmed here. the presence of embp was demon-
strated both in primary tumours and lymph node and
cutaneous metastases by two different techniques.

the human embp has been partially characterized, and
its significant interspecies immunoreactivity with different
antibodies raised against purified rat embp has been
clearly demonstrated.**°? the mouse monoclonal antibody
(mab embp 1) has previously been used for
immunohistochemical detection of embp in human pros-
tatic cancer.’ staining was found in the cytoplasm of the
epithelium and was more intense in moderately and poorly
differentiated, than in well differentiated tumours.” in the
present pilot study, all the 11 primary malignant melano-
mas displayed a positive staining. the range in the number
of positive cells might reflect tumour heterogeneity, but
there was also a correlation with time to recurrence (figure
2). experiments in prostatic cancer indicate an association
between embp expression and proliferative activity.®

the radioimmunoassay based on a polyclonal rabbit
antiserum has previously been used to measure embp
concentrations in various organs of the rat and also allows
quantitative estimates in human cytosol.’ the absolute
values however, remain uncertain since the exact degree of
cross reactivity is difficult to assess in the absence of
completely purified human embp. the embp concentra-
tions measured here in 12 metastases of malignant
melanomas were somewhat lower than the levels previ-
ously reported in human benign and malignant prostatic
tissue*® but in the same range as for astrocytomas."”

the biological role of embp is unknown. steroid binding
and a modulating role in the action of androgens as well
as an immunosuppressive function have been sug-
gested.” embp inhibits the assembly of microtubules i7
vitro by proteolytic cleavage of microtubule-associated
proteins” and also displays binding affinity for certain
carcinogens.?”**

an influence of sex steroids on malignant melanoma has
been discussed. an increased risk of malignant melanoma
was claimed in a cohort study of women receiving non-
contraceptive estrogens.”*" in contrast to the possible
melanoma promoting effect of estrogens in women,
estrogens were reported to inhibit growth of the hamster
melanoma cell line hm-1.*! pigmented lesions are likely to
possess sex hormone binding proteins other than the
 xxxg730xxx .” embp may be an example of such a

404 = melanoma research « vol 4 + 1994

protein, since it is distinct from the  xxxg730xxx  but
displays low affinity binding of estradiol and estrone. high
concentrations of estradiol in malignant glioma tissue may
be related to the presence of embp.* it is thus possible that
embp is involved in mediating sex-steroid effects on
melanoma tumours.

the prognosis of malignant melanoma varies according
to sex and different histological and biological parameters.
in the present small material a high number of cells with
a positive stain for embp in the primary tumour was related
to a short interval between diagnosis and the occurrence of
metastases (figure 2). further studies on the possible
prognostic significance of embp are indicated.

an  xxxd2041xxx  binding site was previously demon-
strated in malignant melanoma by isoelectric focusing.’
with this background the therapeutic effect of  xxxd2041xxx 
was investigated in 26 patients, but only a low antitumour
activity was observed.** however, the  xxxd2041xxx  binding
site was later found to be distinct from embp" and the
limited number of patients did not allow a correlation
analysis between response and binding capacity. high
levels of embp may correlate with the accumulation and
antitumoural effect of  xxxd2041xxx .* in the present mate-
rial there was a wide range in positive staining for embp
in the different tumours with several tumours containing
> 80% of positive cells. thus a therapeutic effect of
 xxxd2041xxx  might be possible in such individuals with
tumour with amounts of the binding protein.

in conclusion the present data show that significant
amounts of embp are present in primary malignant
melanomas and their metastases. these findings clearly
justify further investigations on the role of hormone linked
cytostatic drugs in the treatment of this disease.
