abstract
the blockade of akt activation through the inhibition of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1) represents a major signaling mechanism whereby  xxxd457xxx  mediates apoptosis.  xxxd457xxx , however, is a
weak pdk-1 inhibitor (ic50, 48 ␮m), requiring at least 30 ␮m to exhibit
discernable effects on the growth of tumor cells in vitro. here, we report
the structure-based optimization of  xxxd457xxx  to develop pdk-1 inhibitors
with greater potency in enzyme inhibition and growth inhibition. kinetics
of pdk-1 inhibition by  xxxd457xxx  with respect to atp suggest that  xxxd457xxx  derivatives inhibit pdk-1 by competing with atp for binding, a
mechanism reminiscent to that of many kinase inhibitors. structureactivity analysis together with molecular modeling was used to generate
compounds that were tested for their potency in inhibiting pdk-1 kinase
activity and in inducing apoptosis in pc-3 prostate cancer cells. docking
of potent compounds into the atp-binding site of pdk-1 was performed
for lead optimization, leading to two compounds, osu-03012 and osu03013, with ic50 values in pdk-1 inhibition and apoptosis induction in the
low ␮m range. exposure of pc-3 cells to these agents led to akt dephosphorylation and inhibition of p70 s6 kinase activity. moreover, overexpression of constitutively active forms of pdk-1 and akt partially protected osu-03012-induced apoptosis. screening in a panel of 60 cell lines
and more extensive testing in pc-3 cells indicated that the mean concentration for total growth inhibition was ⬃3 ␮m for both agents. considering the conserved role of pdk-1/akt signaling in promoting tumorigenesis, these  xxxd457xxx  analogs are of translational relevance for cancer
prevention and therapy.

introduction
after demonstration of the efficacy of  xxxd457xxx  in reducing colorectal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (1), use
of this cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitor in the prevention of epithelial malignancies has been the subject of a series of clinical trials.
despite these ongoing clinical investigations, the molecular mechanism underlying  xxxd457xxx -mediated in vivo antitumor effects remains
elusive. at the cellular level,  xxxd457xxx  inhibits cox-2 and causes cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. evidence is accumulating
that the in vitro effects of  xxxd457xxx  on cell cycle progression and
apoptosis are mediated through cox-2-independent signaling mechanisms (2– 6). among various putative pathways reported, the blockade of akt activation through the inhibition of its upstream kinase,
3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1), is especially noteworthy (2–5, 7, 8). our data indicate that  xxxd457xxx  inhibits pdk-1/
akt signaling with moderate potency and that structural modifications
allowed the inhibitory effect of  xxxd457xxx  on akt activation to be
separated from the cox-2 inhibitory activity (4, 5). together, this

paradigm shift provides molecular underpinnings for the pharmacological exploitation of  xxxd457xxx  to develop a novel class of potent
pdk-1/akt signaling inhibitors, of which the proof of principle has
been demonstrated in our previous reports (4, 5).
the phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase/pdk-1/akt signaling cascade
represents a convergence point for a plethora of receptor tyrosine
kinase and cytokine-mediated pathways that regulate cell proliferation
and survival and offers a framework to account for the ability of many
extracellular trophic factors to maintain cell survival (9 –15). dysregulation of this signaling cascade due to constitutive growth factorreceptor activation and/or pten mutations results in akt up-regulation, which subsequently promotes tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis,
and progression (16 –19). thus, pdk-1/akt signaling inhibitors are of
translational relevance for development into useful chemotherapeutic
or chemopreventive agents. in this study, we carried out structurebased optimization of  xxxd457xxx  using an integrated approach combining structure-activity analysis and molecular modeling, leading to
two potent pdk-1 inhibitors, osu- 03012 and osu-03013, with ic50
values at the low ␮m range. these two pdk-1 inhibitors could
achieve total growth inhibition in 60 different human tumor cell lines
at a mean concentration of ⬃3 ␮m.
materials and methods
reagents.  xxxd457xxx  was extracted from  xxxd457xxx  capsules obtained from
amerisource health (malvern, pa) with ethyl acetate followed by recrystallization from a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane. the cell death detection
elisa kit was purchased from roche diagnostics (mannheim, germany).
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against akt and phospho-473ser akt were obtained from cell signaling technologies (beverly, ma). mouse monoclonal
anti-poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) antibody was provided by pharmingen (san diego, ca). the pdk-1 kinase assay kit was purchased from
upstate (lake placid, ny). other chemical and biochemicals were obtained
from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo) unless otherwise mentioned. nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra (1h nmr) were measured on bruker 250 mhz.
chemical shifts (␦) are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane peak with cdcl3 as solvent unless otherwise mentioned. high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses were performed with a
3-tesla finnigan ftms-2000 fourier transform mass spectrometer.
synthesis of chemicals. in this article, we discussed 36 compounds, of
which the chemical names, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1h nmr), and
high-resolution mass spectrometry data are summarized in table 1. the
procedures used to synthesize compounds 1–36 are described in the supplementary data section.
cell culture. pc-3 (p53⫺/⫺) human androgen-nonresponsive prostate cancer cells were purchased from the american type tissue collection (manassas, va). cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 (life technologies, inc., grand
island, ny) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; life technologies, inc.) at 37°c in a humidified incubator containing 5% co2.
cell viability analysis. the effect of  xxxd457xxx  and its derivatives on pc-3
cell viability was assessed by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide assay in six replicates. cells were grown in
10% fbs- supplemented rpmi 1640 in 96-well, flat-bottomed plates for 24 h,
and were exposed to various concentrations of  xxxd457xxx  derivatives dissolved
in dmso (final concentration ⱕ0.1%) in 1% serum-containing rpmi 1640 for
different time intervals. controls received dmso vehicle at a concentration
equal to that in drug-treated cells. the medium was removed, replaced by 200

a novel class of pdk-1 inhibitors

pdk-1 kinase assay. this in vitro assay was performed using a pdk-1
kinase assay kit (upstate) according to the vendor’s instructions. this cell-free
assay is based on the ability of recombinant pdk-1, in the presence of dmso
vehicle or the test agent, to activate its downstream kinase serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase which, in turn, phosphorylates the akt/serum- and
glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-specific peptide substrate rpraatf with
[␥-32p]atp. the 32p-phosphorylated peptide substrate was then separated
from the residual [␥-32p]-atp using  xxxg740xxx  phosphocellulose paper and quantitated by a scintillation counter after three washes with 0.75% phosphoric acid.
the reported values represent the means of two independent determinations.
immunoprecipitated akt kinase assay. akt immunoprecipitation was
carried out according to a modified, published procedure (7). pc-3 cells were
treated with dmso vehicle or the test agents at the indicated concentrations
for 2 h and then lysed at 4°c for 1 h in buffer a containing 50 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), 1% triton x-100, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 50 mm sodium
fluoride, 10 mm sodium ␤-glycerophosphate, 0.1% 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 ␮g/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and
leupeptin. cell lysates were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g for 5 min, and the
supernatant was treated with anti-akt at 4°c for 60 min, followed by protein
g-agarose beads for additional 60 min. the immunoprecipitate was used to
analyze akt kinase activity by using the akt/serum- and glucocorticoidregulated kinase-specific peptide substrate rpraatf as described above.
values represent the means of two independent determinations.
immunoprecipitated p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k) assay. immunoprecipitation of p70s6k was carried out according to a modification of a published
procedure (20). in brief, pc-3 cells were cultured in t-75 flasks (1.5 ⫻ 106/
flask), and treated with osu-03012 at the indicated concentrations in 1%
fbs-containing rpmi 1640 for 6 h. both floating and adherent cells were
collected and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer [50 mm tris (ph7.4), 150 mm nacl,
1% np40, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 1 mm egta, and 10% protease
inhibitor mixture (calbiochem)] for 30 min on ice. lysates were centrifuged at
10,000 ⫻ g at 4°c for 20 min. equal amounts of total protein were subject to
immunoprecipitation with anti-p70s6k antibody (sc-8418; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca). the mixture was incubated on ice with rocking for
1 h, followed by incubation with protein a-sepharose bead for 2 h. the
immunocomplex was washed with lysis buffer twice, followed by assay buffer
[20 mm  xxxd2679xxx  (ph 7.2), 25 mm ␤-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm egta, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dtt], and
resuspended in assay buffer. the assay was carried out using a p70s6k assay
kit (upstate) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
transient transfection. the constitutively active akt construct hapkbt308d/s473d and the constitutively active pdk-1 construct pcdnapdk1-a280v were kindly provided by dr. brain hemmings (friedrich miescher institute, basel, switzerland) and dr. feng liu (university of texas
health science center, san antonio, tx), respectively. pc-3 cells were seeded
into t-75 flasks (1.5 ⫻ 106/flask). aliquots containing 3 ␮g of each plasmid
or a control pcdna3.1(⫹) vector in 750 ␮l of opti-mem (invitrogen-life
technologies, inc.) were incubated with 9 ␮l of the fugene 6 reagent (roche
diagnostics corp., indianapolis, in) for 15 min. each flask was washed with
opti-mem and then received the plasmid-fugene 6 mixture and 4 ml of
opti-mem. the flask was placed in a co2 incubator for 4 h, and the
transfection medium was replaced with 10% fbs-supplemented rpmi 1640.
after 24 h, mock-, akt-, and pdk-1-transfected pc-3 cells were seeded into
96-well plates at 5000 cells/well in 10% fbs-supplemented rpmi 1640. on
the next day, cells were treated in four replicates with the indicated concentrations of osu-03012 in 1% fbs- containing medium for 24 h. 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide assay was used to
determine the cell viability.
molecular modeling. the crystal structure of pdk-1 in complex with
atp, obtained from the brookhaven protein data bank (entry code 1h1w),
was subject to the deletion of heteroatoms and the addition of polar hydrogens,
partial atomic charges, and atomic solvation parameters using the molecular
modeling software autodock tools.1 the three-dimensional structures of
small molecules were generated using the software sybyl 6.9 (tripos associate, st. louis, mo; 2002). gasteiger charges were computed, and energy

results
structural optimization of  xxxd457xxx  in pdk-1 inhibition. on
the basis of structure-activity analysis, we reported previously a
working model that defined structural features essential to the apoptotic effect of  xxxd457xxx  in pc-3 prostate cancer cells (5). this model
suggested that the 5-aryl and sulfonamide (-so2nh2) moieties were
amenable to alterations, whereas the electrostatic potential surrounding the heterocyclic system was integral to the apoptosis-inducing
potency. accordingly, in the first series of structural modifications,
the 4-methylphenyl moiety of  xxxd457xxx  was replaced by a series of
aromatic groups with discrete stereochemical properties, whereas the
integrity of the  xxxd3045xxx  ring was maintained. the structure and
potency in inhibiting pdk-1 kinase activity and pc-3 cell growth of
24 representative derivatives are summarized in fig. 1.
these compounds, except the indole derivative 8, showed improved
pdk-1 inhibitory and antiproliferative activities vis-à-vis  xxxd457xxx ,
whereas none of these derivatives displayed measurable cox-2 inhibitory activity (data not shown). this finding confirmed the structural divergence required for the inhibition of pdk-1 versus cox-2
(5). a general increase in pdk-1 inhibitory activity was noted with
increasing bulkiness of the aromatic ring, i.e., tricyclic aromatic rings
(21–23) ⬎ substituted biphenyl (9 –19) ⬎ substituted phenyl (1– 6).
these data, together with the decrease in potency in compound 8,
suggested that the aromatic system bound to a large, hydrophobic
region of the enzyme pocket. among the 24 analogs examined,
compound 23 (designated as osu-02067) represented the optimal
derivative with ic50 values of 9 ␮m and 5 ␮m for inhibiting pdk-1
activity and pc-3 cell viability, respectively (fig. 2, a and c). these
ic50 values corresponded to a 5– 6-fold improvement over the activities of  xxxd457xxx  (48 ␮m and 30 ␮m, respectively). however, the
osu-02067 isomer 24 exhibited a precipitous decrease in pdk-1
inhibitory activity, which might be attributable to steric hindrance
imposed by an unfavorable orientation of the tricyclic aromatic ring.
there existed a correlation between pdk-1 and pc-3 growth inhibition potency in all of the compounds examined, suggesting the
mechanistic relevance of pdk-1 inhibition to the antiproliferative
effect. overall, the ic50 value for inhibiting pc-3 cell proliferation
was approximately one half of that of pdk-1 inhibition. this discrepancy might arise from a mechanistic synergy between pdk-1 inhibition and concomitant akt dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase
2a in drug-treated cells, resulting in augmented akt deactivation. to
examine this premise, pc-3 cells were treated with different concentrations of osu-02067 for 2 h, and the consequent effect on akt was
assessed by two independent assays: immunoprecipitated akt kinase
activity (fig. 2b, top panel) and akt phosphorylation status (fig. 2b,
bottom panel). as shown, both assays gave consistent results.

a novel class of pdk-1 inhibitors

fig. 1. structures and potency for inhibiting recombinant 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1) kinase activity and for
inducing apoptotic death in pc-3 cells for  xxxd457xxx  and derivatives
1–24. the general structure of these compounds is shown at the top.
ar represents the respective aromatic ring structures. the reported
ic50 values are concentrations at which recombinant pdk-1 kinase
activity is inhibited by 50% or at which pc-3 cell death measures
50% relative to dmso control after 24 h-exposure in 1% fetal
bovine serum-containing rpmi 1640.

according to the kinase assay, the ic50 of osu-02067 for inhibiting intracellular akt activation was 5 ␮m vis-à-vis 28 ␮m for
 xxxd457xxx . neither osu-02067 nor other  xxxd457xxx  derivatives displayed a direct inhibitory effect on immunoprecipitated akt activity.
meanwhile, western blot analysis shows that treatment of pc-3 cells
with osu- 02067 at ⱖ5 ␮m led to significant akt dephosphorylation.
the inhibition of pdk-1/akt signaling led to apoptotic death in
pc-3 cells in 1% of fbs-containing rpmi 1640 in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 2c), as evidenced by dna fragmentation (fig. 2d, top
panel) and parp cleavage (fig. 2d, bottom panel). the dose of
osu-02067 required to induce 50% pc-3 cell death at 24 h was 5 ␮m,
as compared with that of ⬃30 ␮m for  xxxd457xxx  (data not shown). the
ic50 values for both osu-02067 and  xxxd457xxx  to induce pc-3 cell
death was consistent with that of inhibiting akt activation in drugtreated cells. furthermore, the effect of osu-02067 vis-à-vis  xxxd457xxx  on pc-3 cell proliferation was examined in 10% fbs-supplemented rpmi 1640 (fig. 2e). as shown, osu-02067 at 1 ␮m showed
substantial antiproliferative activity, exceeding that of 30 ␮m  xxxd457xxx . together, these data clearly indicated the in vitro efficacy of
osu-02067 in pc-3 growth inhibition and prompted us to undertake
additional lead optimization via structure-based design.
molecular modeling and structure-based optimization. kinetics of pdk-1 inhibition by  xxxd457xxx  with respect to atp was examined to shed light onto the mechanistic basis by which these  xxxd457xxx 
derivatives mediated enzyme inhibition. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd457xxx  on pdk-1 kinase activity was determined in the presence of
various concentrations of atp. kinetic data revealed an inverse
relationship between the degree of  xxxd457xxx -exerted pdk-1 inhibition and atp concentrations. the resulting lineweaver-burke plot
indicated that  xxxd457xxx  inhibited pdk-1 through competition with
atp (fig. 3).

this mode of inhibition (i.e., atp competition) is common among
numerous classes of protein or lipid kinase inhibitors that possess
therapeutic potential (22), including those of bcr-abl (e.g., gleevec;
refs. 23–25),  xxxg681xxx  receptors (e.g., iressa; ref. 26),
phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase (e.g.,  xxxd2523xxx ; ref. 27), protein
kinase c ( xxxd3241xxx ; ref. 28), cyclin-dependent kinases (29), and
 xxxg2413xxx  receptors (30). structure-activity
data indicate that although the atp-binding site is conserved, architecture in the proximal regions of different protein kinases provides a
high degree of diversity (22). evidence indicates that this diversity
allows the design of selective kinase inhibitors.
together, these findings provided a molecular rationale for structure-based optimization on the basis of the framework generated by
the crystal structure of pdk-1-atp complex (31). osu-02067 was
docked into the atp-binding domain that is located within a deep
cleft between the two lobes of pdk-1 (fig. 4a). although osu02067 competed with atp for binding, the mode of binding for
osu-02067 was found to be somewhat different from that of atp
(fig. 4b).
although the benzenesulfonamide moiety occupied the adeninebinding motif, the planar  xxxd3045xxx  moiety was perpendicular to the
ribose ring. this arrangement positioned the adjacent phenanthrene
ring behind the trisphosphate-binding pocket. the phenanthrene ring
formed hydrophobic interactions with an  xxxd1850xxx  region formed by
residues 88 –96 encompassing part of two adjacent ␤ sheets joined by
a glycine-rich loop. this locality, adjoining to the phosphate-binding

by the ⬎5-fold increase in potency of osu-02067 (ic50, 9 ␮m) over
 xxxd457xxx  (ic50, 48 ␮m). this hydrophobic cleft appeared to favor the
binding of a large, planar aromatic system such as the phenanthrene
ring. for example, as compared with osu-02067, compounds 9 –19,

containing conformationally more flexible biphenyl systems, were
less effective in enzyme inhibition. the discrepancy in potency between  xxxd457xxx  and osu-02067 was likely attributable to the desolvation of the hydrophobic amino acid residues upon binding of the
methylphenyl versus phenanthrenyl moiety (29). assuming that the
measured ic50 values were proportional to the kd of the proteinligand interaction, the relative free energy difference between  xxxd457xxx  and osu-02067 was approximately ⫺4 kj/mol. the upper limit
for the free energy associated with the desolvation of hydrophobic
groups has been estimated to be ⫺136 j/mol•å2 (32). considering
that the binding of the phenanthrene ring of osu-02067 covers 32 å2
more  xxxd1850xxx  surface than the methylphenyl moiety does, the corre-

sponding free energy change was estimated to be ⫺4.35 kj/mol,
which is consistent with the experimentally measured free energy
difference.
the sulfonamide group (either oxygen or nitrogen) formed hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of ala162 in the hinge region.
this bond lattice mimicked one of the two hydrogen bonds formed by
the adenine of atp in the same microdomain, in which 6-nh donates
a hydrogen bond to carbonyl of ser160 and 1-n accepts a hydrogen
bond from nh of ala162 (31). no hydrogen bond was formed
between the  xxxd3045xxx  ring and glu166, but the ribose of atp accepts
a hydrogen bond from glu166. in light of the importance of hydrogen
bonding with ala 162 and ser160 in ligand anchoring, we carried out
structure optimization of osu-02067 by replacing its sulfonamide
moiety with a series of heteroatom-rich functional groups that could
potentially form hydrogen bonding with the backbone amide and/or
carbonyl of these two residues. structures of 13 representative derivatives, their potency against pdk-1, and their ability to cause apoptotic death in pc-3 cells are summarized in fig. 5.
among these derivatives, compounds 34 (designated as osu03012) and 35 (designated as osu-03013) exhibited ic50 values for
pdk-1 inhibition of 5 and 2 ␮m, respectively, which represented 2and 5-fold increases in potency over osu-02067 (fig. 6a).
compounds 34 and 35 contained side chains of 2- xxxd149xxx 
and guanidine, respectively. this improvement in potency reflected a
strengthening of the hydrogen bonding in the protein-ligand interactions for these derivatives. this premise was supported by the modeled docking of osu-03013 into the atp-binding site (fig. 4c). the
guanidino group of osu-03013 resembled the partial structure of the
purine ring of atp, which allowed the formation of hydrogen bonds
with ser160 and ala162 as depicted by the docking model.
like osu-02067, they exhibited no appreciable direct inhibition on
immunoprecipitated akt kinase activity (data not shown) nor was any
measurable cox-2 inhibitory activity detected at concentrations up to
50 ␮m. as shown in fig. 6b, exposure of pc-3 cells to either agent,
even at 1 ␮m, resulted in a substantial decrease in the phospho-akt
level. because pdk-1 also phosphorylates other members of the ags
protein kinase family such as p70s6k (20, 33–35), we assessed the
kinase activity of immunoprecipitated p70s6k in drug-treated pc-3
cells. as indicated in fig. 6c, the activity of immunoprecipitated
p70s6k was reduced in a dose-dependent manner after exposing pc-3
cells to osu-03012 at the indicated concentrations for 6 h.

these agents exhibited higher potency than osu-02067 in apoptosis
induction at concentrations ⬎2.5 ␮m.
the effects of osu-03012 and osu-03013 on pc-3 cell proliferation in 10% fbs-supplemented medium were also examined (fig.
7c). high levels of serum might affect the efficacy of these pdk-1
inhibitors due to several factors. first, these  xxxd457xxx  derivatives
might display high serum-binding affinity, thereby sequestering them
from entering cells. second, continuous stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase/akt signaling through various growth factor receptors counters the inhibitory effect of these agents on akt. third, serum
could up-regulate  xxxg251xxx  in pc-3 cells, which enhances the threshold
to apoptotic signals emanating from phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase/
akt inhibition (36). as shown, osu-03012 was effective in suppressing pc-3 cell proliferation at sub-␮m, consistent with that noted in 1%
serum. in contrast, osu-03013 required higher concentrations than
osu-03012 to achieve the same degree of antiproliferative effects
although it had higher pdk-1 inhibitory potency.
to confirm that inhibition of pdk-1/akt signaling represented the
underlying antitumor mechanism for these agents, we assessed the
protective effect of the transient expression of the constitutively active
forms of pdk-1 and akt [pdk-1a280v (37) and aktt308d/s473d (38),
respectively] on the drug-induced pc-3 cell death. western blot
analysis using antibodies against pdk-1, akt, and the respective myc
and hemagglutinin tags confirmed that transient transfection of pdk1a280v and aktt308d/s473d into pc-3 cells led to increase in the

expression levels of the respective kinases (fig. 8a). these transient
transfectants were exposed to 1–10 ␮m osu-03012 in 1% fbscontaining medium for 24 h to examine the susceptibility to osu03012-induced cell death vis-à-vis transfectants with an empty
pcdna vector. as shown, both pdk-1a280v and aktt308d/s473d
expression gave partial, yet significant, protection against osu03012-induced apoptotic death (fig. 8b), which underscores the involvement of both kinases in the antitumor effects of these  xxxd457xxx 
derivatives.
moreover, these derivatives were submitted to the developmental
therapeutic program at the national cancer institute for screening
against 60 human tumor cell lines, representing leukemia, melanoma,
and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and
kidney.3 dose-response data of one representative cell line from each
class of tumor cells after 2-day exposure in 5% fbs-containing
medium are shown in fig. 9, which include: (a) rpmi- 8226 leukemia
cells; (b) nci-h322m non-small cell lung cancer cells; (c) ht29
colon cancer cells; (d) u251 glioblastoma cancer cells; (e) skmel-28 melanoma cancer cells; (f) sk-ov-3 ovarian cancer cells;
(g) rxf 393 renal cancer cells; (h) pc-3 prostate cancer cells; and (i)
mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells. many of these cell lines were
responsive to the growth inhibitory effect of both agents at concentrations as low as 0.1 ␮m.

fig. 5. structures and potency for inhibiting recombinant 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1) kinase activity and for
inducing apoptotic death in pc-3 cells for derivatives 25–37. the
general structure of these compounds is shown at the top. r represents the respective substitution in place of the sulfonamide moiety.
the reported ic50 values are concentrations at which pdk-1 kinase
activity is inhibited by 50% or at which pc-3 cell death measures
50% relative to dmso control after 24 h-exposure in 1% fetal
bovine serum-containing rpmi 1640.

in the 60 cell line assay, three dose-response parameters for each
cell line were calculated based on growth inhibition curves. these
parameters include concentration resulting in 50% growth inhibition,
concentration resulting in total growth inhibition, and concentration
resulting in a 50% reduction in the measured protein level at the end
of drug treatment as compared with that at the beginning. the means
of these parameters among the 60 different cell lines for osu-03012
and osu-03013 after 2-day treatment were as follows, respectively,
concentration resulting in 50% growth inhibition, 1.1 and 1.2 ␮m;
concentration resulting in total growth inhibition, 3.2 and 2.9 ␮m; and
concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the measured protein
level at the end of drug treatment as compared with that at the
beginning, 6.8 and 8.5 ␮m. in contrast, for osu-02067, the corresponding values were 3.0, 19, and 66 ␮m, respectively. these data
clearly demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of osu-03012 and osu03013. both agents were able to completely suppress cell growth in a
diverse range of tumor cell lines at the 3–5 ␮m therapeutic range, as
compared with the concentration of at least 50 ␮m required for
 xxxd457xxx .

‘“materials and methods” (top). values are means; bars, ⫾sd (n ⫽ 3). a portion of the
cell lysates was separated by sds-page and western blotted using antibodies specific
for p70s6k (bottom).

in light of the conserved role of pdk-1/akt signaling in cancer cell
survival and proliferation (9, 10, 12–15), this pathway represents a
therapeutically relevant target for developing orally bioavailable,
small-molecule inhibitors. our previous structure-activity analysis
provided a proof of principle that the apoptosis-inducing activity of
 xxxd457xxx  could be separated from its cox-2 inhibitory activity via
structural modifications (5). furthermore, these data allowed us to
establish a working model depicting the structural attributes essential
to the pdk-1 versus cox-2 inhibitory activity of  xxxd457xxx . this
model, in conjunction with the crystal structure of pdk-1-atp complexes reported recently (31), provided a molecular foundation for the
present structure-based optimization. kinetic and molecular modeling
data indicate that  xxxd457xxx  derivatives exerted pdk-1 inhibition by
competing with atp for binding, a mechanism shared by many types

values of 5 and 2 ␮m, respectively (fig. 6a). docking of osu-03013 into
the atp binding site revealed increased hydrogen bonding between the
guanidine moiety and the backbone oxygen of ser160. the effect of these
substituents on ligand binding, however, was subtle, as illustrated by the
structure-activity relationship summarized in fig. 5.
the high potency of osu-03012 and osu-03013 in pdk-1 inhibition
was reflected in their abilities to effectively block the activation of akt
and p70s6k (fig. 6) and to induce apoptotic cell death in pc-3 cells at low
␮m concentrations (fig. 7). more importantly, due to the conserved role
of pdk-1/akt signaling in cell proliferation and survival, these agents
were potent in inhibiting cell growth in serum-containing medium in all
60 of the human tumor cell lines examined, with mean concentration
resulting in 50% growth inhibition values of 1.2 ␮m and 1.3 ␮m, respec-

of kinase inhibitors. structural optimization of  xxxd457xxx  by altering
the terminal phenyl ring led to osu-02067 with a 5-fold improvement
in pdk-1 inhibitory potency. this improvement was attributable to
enhanced hydrophobic ligand interactions with the  xxxd1850xxx  region
adjacent to the trisphosphate-binding pocket. moreover, in silico
docking of osu-02067 into the atp-binding pocket showed that the
molecule was anchored into the atp binding domain, in part, through
hydrogen bonding between the sulfonamide and the amide of ala162.
ala162 has also been reported to play a key role in anchoring other
ligands such as atp (31) and  xxxd4xxx   xxxd697xxx  (39) to pdk-1. together, these
data suggest that the sulfonamide moiety of osu-02067 might be
amenable to alterations for optimizing potency.
accordingly, replacement of the sulfonamide function with 2- xxxd149xxx  and guanidine led to osu-03012 and osu-03013, respectively, both of which exhibited improved pdk-1 inhibition with ic50

tively, and concentration resulting in total growth inhibition (total growth
inhibition) values of 3.2 and 2.9 ␮m, respectively.
in summary, the present study has clearly demonstrated the successful development of a new class of pdk-1/akt signaling inhibitors
via structure-based optimization of  xxxd457xxx . in light of the prominent role of pdk-1/akt signaling in different stages of tumorigenesis,
these molecules have translational potential to be developed into
antitumor agents for the prevention and/or therapy of cancers alone or
in combination with other treatments. testing of in vivo efficacy
against different tumor xenografts in nude mice is currently under way
in this laboratory.

editor's note

editor's note: from the  xxxg1884xxx 
inhibitor  xxxd457xxx  to a novel class of
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
kinase-1 inhibitors

the editors are publishing this note to alert the readers to a concern about this
article (1). the editors were made aware of apparent splicing between western blot
lanes 3 and 4 in fig. 7b. ohio state university (columbus, oh) conducted an
investigation, but was not able to determine whether the splicing of the image had
any impact on the reported results of the experiment described in fig. 7b because the
authors were unable to provide the original research records related to the ﬁgure.
