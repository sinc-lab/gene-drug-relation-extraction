abstract: the sweet taste receptor is a heterodimer of two g protein coupled receptors,  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3. this discovery
has increased our understanding at the molecular level of the mechanisms underlying sweet taste. previous experimental
studies using sweet receptor chimeras and mutants show that there are at least three potential binding sites in this heterodimeric receptor. receptor activity toward the artificial sweeteners aspartame and neotame depends on residues in the
amino terminal domain of human  xxxg2249xxx . in contrast, receptor activity toward the sweetener cyclamate and the sweet taste
inhibitor lactisole depends on residues within the transmembrane domain of human t1r3. furthermore, receptor activity
toward the sweet protein brazzein depends on the cysteine rich domain of human t1r3. although crystal structures are
not available for the sweet taste receptor, useful homology models can be developed based on appropriate templates. the
amino terminal domain, cysteine rich domain and transmembrane helix domain of  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3 have been modeled
based on the crystal structures of metabotropic  xxxg981xxx  type 1,  xxxg2296xxx  receptor, and bovine
rhodopsin, respectively. we have used homology models of the sweet taste receptors, molecular docking of sweet ligands
to the receptors, and site-directed mutagenesis of the receptors to identify potential ligand binding sites of the sweet taste
receptor. these studies have led to a better understanding of the structure and function of this heterodimeric receptor, and
can act as a guide for rational structure-based design of novel non-caloric sweeteners, which can be used in the fighting
against obesity and diabetes.

key words: homology modeling, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, sweeteners, sweet taste inhibitors, sweet proteins.
introduction
the sense of taste is important for humans and other organisms in evaluating the nutritive quality of foods. humans
and other mammals can detect and discriminate between at
least five taste qualities: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami
[1]. the identification of sweet and bitter tastes is particularly important for humans in seeking out the needed carbohydrates with high nutritive value, avoiding potentially
deadly plant alkaloids and other bitter tasting environmental
toxins [2-4]. the tastes of sour and salty are thought to be
mediated by direct effects on specialized membrane channels
[5-9]. sweet, bitter, and umami taste transduction, on the
other hand, is mediated by g protein-coupled receptors
(gpcrs) and their linked signaling pathways [3, 10-15].
taste receptor cells are specialized epithelial cells generally found within taste buds embedded within the tongue
epithelium. each taste bud is shaped like a garlic clove and is
composed of 50-150 cells [1]. taste buds are found in papillae on the tongue as well as on the palate and pharynx. in
vertebrates there are three kinds of taste papillae which can
be distinguished on the basis of morphology and location,

fungiform, foliate and circumvallate [16]. taste receptor
proteins and other signaling elements are located in the microvilli of the taste receptor cells, where they serve as the
initial detectors underlying taste qualities. the identification
of two families of receptors, t1rs and t2rs, responsive to
sweet/umami and bitter taste stimuli, respectively, has shed
light on some of the basic mechanisms underlying taste
transduction in mammals [12, 17-25].
recently, multiple groups identified a novel t1r gene,
t1r3, as a candidate sweet receptor gene [3, 17, 19-21]. the
heterodimer of  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3 ( xxxg2249xxx /t1r3) is a broadly
acting sweet taste receptor responsive to natural sugars, artificial sweeteners, d-amino acids, and sweet-tasting proteins
[3, 13, 20, 26]. the t1rs, a small family of gpcrs expressed in taste cells of the tongue and palate, are related to
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs), the calcium
sensing receptor, and vomeronasal receptors. t1rs are characterized by a large extracellular amino terminal domain
(atd), which is linked by a cysteine rich domain (crd) to
the 7-tm-domain (tmd) [27]. by analogy with  xxxg972xxx ’s
atd, for which ligand-bound crystal structures are available
[28], it has been proposed that the atd of  xxxg2249xxx /t1r3 may
bind some sweeteners [16, 28].
in addition to sucrose,  xxxg2249xxx /t1r3 responds to many
other sweet taste stimuli: the sugars fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, and maltose; the amino acids glycine and d© 2006 bentham science publishers ltd.

tryptophan; the sweet proteins brazzein, monellin and thaumatin; and the synthetic sweeteners cyclamate, saccharin,
acesulfame k, aspartame, dulcin, neotame and sucralose [3,
29]. sweet taste in humans is inhibited by the inhibitor lactisole [30, 31]. this inhibition has been proposed to reflect
specific antagonism at the  xxxg2249xxx /t1r3 receptor, because
lactisole did not inhibit the galpha15-dependent activity of endogenous beta2-adrenergic receptor [26]. studies with receptor
chimeras and mutants show that the artificial sweeteners
aspartame and neotame interact with  xxxg2249xxx ’s atd, while the
sweetener cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole interact with t1r3’s tmd [22]. in this review paper, we summarized the homology models of sweet taste receptors, and discussed the possible multiple binding sites in the receptor for
sweeteners, sweet proteins, and sweet inhibitors. our recent
modeling results related to sweet taste receptors are also included.
modeling the structure of sweet taste
receptor
the superfamily of gpcrs in mammalian species can be
classified into 7 subfamilies: a, b, lnb-7tm, c, frizzled/
smoothened, taste 2, and vomeronasal type 1 receptors.
t1rs are subfamily c gpcrs. all gpcrs share a common
topology in their transmembrane domain. structural data on
gpcrs based on biochemical, immunological, and biophysical approaches have validated a consensus membrane topology of family a gpcrs with an extracellular n terminus, a
cytoplasmic c terminus, and within the tmd 7 transmembrane helices connected by loops. most gpcrs, including
receptors in subfamilies a, b, c, and vomeronasal type 1
receptors mediate their intracellular actions through pathways involving activation of g-proteins. however, there are
some g-protein-independent ‘gpcrs’ [32].
the first crystal structure of a gpcr was that of bovine
rhodopsin, a gpcr subfamily a type receptor. this is also
the only available crystal structure of any gpcr that contains the 7tm domain [33-35]. the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin has been widely used as a structural template
for comparative modeling to construct homology models of
diverse gpcrs [36-40]. the interplay of site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling has provided detailed insights into molecular mechanisms of ligand binding, receptor
folding, receptor activation, g-protein coupling, and regulation of gpcrs [32]. for example, extensive modeling work
on the  xxxg2328xxx  (trh) receptor combined with experimental testing and refinement produced a
better understanding of the binding event and generated a set
of testable hypotheses of the mechanism of receptor activation. docking experiments identified a binding pocket in the
tmd of the trh receptor, which was subsequently corroborated by experiments [41]. study on the role of the extracellular loops in ligand binding showed that trh is initially
anchored to the receptor surface and then moves into the
tmd binding pocket [42]. investigation of the conserved
trp in tm-6 found that this residue is responsible for maintaining the receptor in an inhibited state as its mutation to
ala produced a constitutively active receptor [43]. furthermore, this trp along with other residues in the binding
pocket for trh were found to be responsible for binding of
an antagonist [44]. extensive study on the role of the relative

cui et al.

positions of  xxxg2318xxx  and tm-6 in the trh receptor suggested
an activation mechanism that was validated by experimental
studies [45]. these examples are just a handful in a rich literature of gpcr modeling, binding of specific ligands and
studies of receptor activation.
the t1rs and other subfamily c gpcrs are characterized by a large extracellular atd and a crd. the crystal
structure has been solved for the atd of  xxxg972xxx  [28], a
subfamily c gpcr. the mglur protein can be divided into
three subunits: the extracellular domain, the seven transmembrane spanning domain and the cytoplasmic domain.
the extracellular part is further divided into the ligand
binding atd and the crd. studies with chimeric constructs
[46] and homology modeling [47, 48] based on the leucine/
isoleucine/valine-binding protein (livbp) [49] both suggest
that the atd of  xxxg972xxx  is responsible for ligand binding.
there are five crystal structures of the  xxxg972xxx -atd homodimer available in the protein data bank (pdb): a glutamate-bound form (pdb: 1ewk), ligand-free forms i (pdb:
1ewt) and ii (pdb: 1ewv) [28], an antagonist (s-mcpg)bound form (pdb: 1iss), and a glutamate/gadolinium-bound
form (pdb: 1isr) [50]. these structures show the configurations of a  xxxg972xxx -atd dimer, which can be defined by
the intra-protomer and inter-protomer conformations: the
open and closed intra-protomer conformations, and two different dimer interaction conformations termed r and a [51].
the glutamate-bound form and the ligand-free for ii crystal
structures are nearly isomorphous with the closed-open/a
forms. the ligand-free form i and the s-mcpg-bound form
are open-open/r forms. the structure with both glutamate
and gadolinium bound is a closed-closed/a form.
the crd is a ~70 amino acids domain with nine highly
conserved cysteines, which bridges the atd and tmd of
the mglur. the crd is conserved among all mglur subtypes and the  xxxg343xxx  (car) [51, 52]. however, no crystal structures have been solved yet for any
gpcr family c crds. most recently, yu et al. proposed a
homology model for a nine-cysteine long crd of family c
gpcrs (ncd3g) based on the structure of the extracellular
domain of the  xxxg2296xxx  receptor (tnfr) (pdb:
1ext) [53]. although the sequence identity between the
crds of t1r3 and tnfr is only 15%, seven out of nine
cysteines can be aligned and three disulfide bonds can be
identified based on the tnfr template. thus, the crd of
t1r3 may share a similar folding pattern with other crds
and the tnfr structure.
the crystal structures of rhodopsin,  xxxg972xxx -atd and
tnfr can be used as templates for homology modeling of
the major domains of the sweet taste receptor (fig. 1). however, the relative positions of the domains of the heterodimeric sweet taste receptor are still hard to predict. presently,
there is no reliable data to position the atd, crd and tmd
domains with respect to each other. furthermore, information about the dimerization surface of two different tmds
from  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3 is the least known. recent experimental and modeling studies on gpcr dimerization [54-59]
may suggest a possible  xxxg2249xxx /t1r3 tmd dimer interface.
the atds are the first domains of the sweet taste receptor
that have been modeled based on the crystal structure of
 xxxg972xxx -atd [19, 60-64]. no models have been published

for the crd or tmd of the sweet taste receptor. accordingly, we have constructed homology models for the human
t1r3 (ht1r3) tmd based on the rhodopsin crystal structure and for the crd based on the tnfr crystal structure
[65]. our models are further validated by wet experiments of
site-directed mutagenesis, and the binding sites for agonists
and antagonists of the sweet taste receptor are proposed.
amino terminal domains of the sweet
taste receptor
by analogy with mglur, for which ligand-bound crystal
structures are available [16, 28], it has been proposed that the
atd of  xxxg2249xxx /t1r3 may be involved in sweetener binding
[16, 28]. recently, xu et al. [22] used chimeras to identify
potential sweet receptor binding sites for the sweeteners aspartame and neotame. since both aspartame and neotame are
sweet for humans but not rodents (i.e. “human specific
sweeteners”), they identified potential ligand binding sites on
the t1rs by testing various chimeras of the human and rat
receptors for responses to these sweeteners. they found that
the atd of human  xxxg2249xxx  (ht1r2) was required for responses to these human specific sweeteners and proposed
this atd is the binding site for these sweeteners. two residues, s144 and e302 of the atd of ht1r2 were identified
by xu et al. as being critical for the aspartame/neotame induced sweet response [22]. jiang et al. [64] identified  xxxd307xxx 
of the atd of  xxxg2249xxx  as another critical residue for sweet
receptor responses to aspartame/ xxxd1794xxx .
to investigate the possible binding pocket in the atd
region, we have constructed a model of ht1r2/ht1r3 atd
(closed-open/a form) based on  xxxg972xxx -atd crystal structure (pdb entry: 1ewk) [28]. a multiple sequence alignment of the atds of ht1r2, ht1r3, mouse  xxxg2249xxx  (mt1r2),
mouse t1r3 (mt1r3), and  xxxg972xxx  was generated by

clustalw [66], followed by minor manual adjustments in the
non-homologous regions. the sequence identity between the
atds of ht1r2, ht1r3 and  xxxg972xxx  was found to be 24%.
the constructed model of the atds was then refined by
molecular mechanics method, using the charmm program
[67] with 6 å water shell according to the following protocol: the whole system was refined by 5000 steps of steepest
descent (sd) minimization with the atd fixed, then by
5000 steps of sd minimization with the backbone of the
atd fixed, the 5000 steps of sd minimization for the whole
system without constraints, followed by 40000 steps of
adapted basis newton-raphson (abnr) minimization or
the convergence criterion as the root mean square energy
gradient of 0.05kcal/mol/å was reached. the refined model
then was evaluated by the verify3d program with acceptable
scores [68, 69]. the detailed refinement and evaluation results will be published separately. the refined ht1r2/ht1r3
atd model is shown in fig. (2).
aspartame (l-alpha-aspartly- xxxd2916xxx  ester)
is a low-calorie sweetener, which is approximately 200 times
sweeter than sucrose [70, 71]. both xu et al. [22] and jiang
et al. [64] demonstrated that the binding site of the sweet
taste receptor for aspartame is located in the atd of ht1r2.
to identify a possible binding pocket for aspartame in ht1r2
atd, we used the refined ht1r2 atd model for automatic
docking studies. the geometry of aspartame was optimized
by ab initio quantum mechanics method at the level of hf/
6-31g*, followed by single point calculations with the polarized continuum model (pcm) solvation to obtain the
molecular electrostatic potential for charge fitting. the
chelpg charge-fitting scheme was used to calculate partial
charges for the atoms of aspartame [72]. the ab initio calculations were carried out with the gaussian 98 program
[73]. the predicted binding site for aspartame in ht1r2’s

atd was derived from molecular docking results by cluster
analysis. the final docked aspartame configuration was constructed based on the calculated binding energies and the
analysis on the cluster distributions. the docked aspartameht1r2 complex was then refined by the charmm program
with 6 å water shell with the same protocol as described
above. the potential binding pocket of ht1r2’s atd with
aspartame bound is shown in fig. (3). we found that the
main interactions of aspartame with ht1r2’s atd can be
classified as salt bridges (asp278 and asp307), hydrogenbonds (ser303, arg383 and val384) and hydrophobic interactions (tyr215, tyr103 and pro277). two water molecules
are also identified to bridge the aspartame and the binding
pocket (asp142 and leu279).

its structure was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr) spectroscopy [80]. it was found that brazzein contains one short alpha-helix, and three strands of antiparallel betasheets held together by four disulfide bonds. site-directed
mutagenesis suggested that the n- and c-termini and the betaturn around arg43 are involved in the sweetness of brazzein

the cysteine-rich domain of the sweet
taste receptor
the crds of the ht1rs are ~70-residue segments with 9
conserved cysteines. it is a unique domain of gpcr family
c, located in the extracellular region connecting the atd
and tmd. the structure and function of the crd is quite
ambiguous. however, several studies have shown that the
crd is required/critical for function of mglur and  xxxg343xxx 
[74-76], and plays a role in the allosteric coupling between
the change in conformation of the atd and that of the tmd
[77]. most recently, jiang et al. demonstrated that residues in
crd of t1r3 are required for the response to the sweet
protein brazzein [78].
brazzein is a small, heat-stable, intensely sweet protein
consisting of 54 amino acid residues. it was initially isolated
from the fruit of pentadiplandra brazzeana baillon [79], and

binding sites of sweet taste receptors

[81-83]. humans, apes, and old world monkeys perceive
brazzein as tasting sweet but other species including new
world monkeys, mouse, and rat do not sense its sweetness
[84-86]. jiang et al. demonstrated that the brazzein-induced
sweet taste response requires the human form of t1r3 [78].
with other human-specific sweeteners, such as aspartame, it
is only required that  xxxg2249xxx  be from human for these sweeteners, and t1r3 can be from a non-human species [3, 13, 22,
26]. using human/mouse chimeras of t1r3 paired with
ht1r2, jiang et al. discovered that ht1r3 residues 536-545
within the crd are required for responsiveness to brazzein.
ala537 and phe540 within this region of ht1r3 were shown
to be critical for responsiveness to brazzein. ht1r2 + humanized mt1r3 with human substitutions at these two positions fully supported the human-like response to brazzein
[78].
jiang et al.’s results further suggest that the crd of
ht1r3 may form part of the binding site for brazzein [78].
however, this hypothesis has not been supported by any
available structural information for the crd of gpcr family c. yu et al. have proposed that tnfr crystal structure

current pharmaceutical design, 2006, vol. 12, no. 35 4595

can serve as a template for modeling the crd of gpcr
family c [53]. although the sequence identity between
ht1r3’s crd and that of tnfr is only 15%, we hypothesize that they share a similar folding pattern. based on the
tnfr crystal structure (pdb: 1ext) [65], we have constructed an homology model of the crd of ht1r3. the sequence alignment between ht1r3 and tnfr and the homology model of ht1r3’s crd are shown in fig. (4). the
crd model shows that six of the nine conserved cysteines
form three disulfide bonds. these disulfide bonds confer
rigidity on the crd, which may be important for the allosteric coupling of the conformational changes that occur upon
ligand binding to the atd being transmitted to the tmd.
jiang et al. identified two unique residues in ht1r3 (ala537
and phe540), which distinguish ht1r3 from mt1r3 and are
important for the human specific sweet response to brazzein.
ala537 of ht1r3’s crd may interact directly with brazzein
or be involved in transmitting the conformational change to
the tmd. mutations to residues with larger side chains, such
as a537t, a537q, a537v, abolish the sweet response to
brazzein. on the other hand, mutants with a smaller side
chain, such as, a537g keep the sweet response to brazzein

[78]. further studies are underway to delineate the role of the
crd in sweet taste response.
the transmembrane domain of the sweet
taste receptor
the binding site for agonists of gpcr family c receptors
has been proposed to be in the extracellular atd [28, 50, 51,
87]. xu et al.’s chimera experiments demonstrated that artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and neotame, require the
atd of ht1r2 [22]. we have used molecular docking to
identify a probable binding site for aspartame in ht1r2’s
atd. however, some gpcr family c members have been
shown to bind ligands in their tmds [37-40, 88]. can the
tmd of the sweet taste receptor bind sweeteners? previous
chimera and mutagenesis studies on ht1r2/ht1r3 showed
that the tmd of ht1r3 is required for cyclamate induced
sweet response, and sweet taste inhibition by lactisole [22,
89].
homology model of the ht1r3’s transmembrane domain
to investigate the possible existence of a binding pocket
in the tmd, we have constructed a homology model of
ht1r3’s tmd based on bovine rhodopsin’s crystal structure
(pdb: 1f88) [33]. a multiple sequence alignment between
t1rs (ht1r2, ht1r3, mt1r2, mt1r3),  xxxg972xxx , and bovine rhodopsin was performed by the clustalw program
[66], followed by some manual adjustments in the nonhomologous regions. the sequence identities (similarities)
between tm1, tm2,  xxxg2318xxx , tm4,  xxxg2318xxx , tm6, and tm7 between ht1r3 and bovine rhodopsin are 22.6% (61.3%),
13.3% (40%), 22.6% (48.4), 25.0% (33.3%), 11.1% (40.7%),
11.8% (61.8%), 16% (60%), respectively. that key conserved
residues in each tm helix of family a gpcrs are also often
present in the corresponding tms of family c receptors increases our confidence in the alignment. the ht1r3 tm
homology model was constructed by residue replacement
using insightii (accelrys, san diego, ca) program. the
non-conserved pro kink in tm helix 6 was built by manually
shifting it to its proper location in the sequence. extracellular
loop3 between tm helix 6 and tm helix 7 was generated by
ab initio loop prediction [90, 91]. the other intra- and extracellular loops were generated by modeller [92, 93]
based on the bovine rhodopsin template. the side chains of
the residues were refined by 500 steps of sd minimization,
followed by 2ps heating to 300k, 20ps equilibration and a
100ps production run at 300k to relax possible bad contacts
in the model. the structure was then minimized for 1000
steps of sd and 10000 steps of abnr or until the root mean
square energy gradient of 0.05kcal/mol/å was achieved.
during the simulation the calpha atoms of the helixes were positionally constrained to prevent possible distortions, and a
distance-dependent dielectric constant (epsilon = 4rij) was used to
mimic environmental effects. all the model refinements were
carried out with charmm [67] using the charmm27 allatom force field.
ht1r3’s tmd binding site for artificial
sweeteners
the chimeric studies of xu et al. show that cyclamate
interact with ht1r3’s tmd [22]. our recent docking and

cui et al.

mutagenesis studies also clearly show that sweet receptor
responsiveness to the artificial sweetener cyclamate depends
on a potential binding site within the tmd of ht1r3 to produce [94]. experimental studies on human/mouse chimeras
of  xxxg2249xxx /t1r3 [94] show that the tmd of the ht1r3 is required for cyclamate-induced receptor activation. alaninescan mutagenesis of the tmd of ht1r3 shows that some
mutations have a small effect on the receptor’s activity toward  xxxd1794xxx , but they caused a substantial reduction
in cyclamate-induced activation of the sweet receptor [94].
we have also found that  xxxd1794xxx  activation of the
sweet taste receptor relies on the atd of ht1r2 [64]. however, these mutations are consistent with the hypothesis that
cyclamate activates the receptor through the tmd. using an
automatic molecular docking method [95, 96], we have
identified a possible binding site for cyclamate in the ht1r3
tmd [94]. the predicted complex of cyclamate and the
ht1r3 tmd is shown in fig. (5a). our homology model
shows that the initial binding pocket is located among the
tm-3, 5 and 6.
ht1r3’s tmd binding site for a sweet taste
inhibitor
lactisole (2-(p-methoxyphenoxy) xxxd3029xxx ) and its
analogs (phenylalkanoic, phenoxyalkanoic and benzylalkanoic acids) inhibit human sweet taste responses [97]. xu et
al. proposed a binding site for lactisole located in the tm
region of ht1r3 [22]. our studies with chimeras of ht1r3
and mt1r3 show that lactisole blocks sweetener-induced
activation of ht1r2/ht1r3 but not of the mixed species
receptor, ht1r2/mt1r3, indicating that ht1r3 is the major
mediator of lactisole antagonism. additional chimeras, where
the tmd of ht1r3 replaces that of mouse in the
mt1r3/mt1r2 receptor show that the presence of the tmd
of ht1r3 is sufficient to support lactisole antagonism. in
contrast, in the absence of the tmd of ht1r3, lactisole
shows no blocking effect. h641a, f778a, q637e, s640v,
a733v and v779a mutations in the tm domain of ht1r3
reduced lactisole’s inhibitory effect [89]. using our homology model of ht1r3 tmd, we identified a possible binding
pocket for lactisole within ht1r3’s tmd. the predicted
model of the lactisole complex with ht1r3 is shown in fig.
(5b). it is clear that lactisole shares the same pocket with
cyclamate, and interacts with his641 and arg723 through
salt bridges and hydrogen bond interactions, while phe778,
leu782, and leu644 produce hydrophobic interactions.
concluding remarks
over the past few decades, several models of the sweet
receptor binding site have been developed based on the
structures of existing sweeteners: the “two-point attachment
theory (the ah-b theory)” [98], the “three-point attachment
theory” [99], and the “multipoint attachment theory” [100].
however, these inferential models are not based on direct
knowledge of the sweet receptor itself. the identification of
the sweet taste receptor has opened the door to understanding the mechanism of sweet taste response. the heterodimer
of  xxxg2249xxx  and t1r3 can respond to almost all sweet molecules including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners, and
sweet-taste proteins. human specific artificial sweeteners
such as, aspartame, neotame, cyclamate; human specific

sweet proteins such as, brazzein; and human specific sweet

binding sites of sweet receptors [22, 78]. results from sitedirected mutagenesis and molecular modeling have played
an important role in identifying the binding sites of the sweet
taste receptor. although there are no crystal structures of any
part of the sweet taste receptor, each part can be modeled
based on a template. the  xxxg972xxx  atd is the first crystal
structure in gpcr family c, which has been used as the
template to model the atds of ht1r3 and ht1r2. the
tnfr crystal has been used to model the crd of ht1r3.
bovine rhodopsin’s solved crystal structure has been used as
a reasonable template for the tmd of ht1r3.

provide new insights on the binding and activation of the
sweet taste receptor.

gpcr

=

g protein-coupled receptor

the current data both from wet experiments and theoretical modeling support the viewpoint that the binding site of
the human sweet taste receptor for the sweeteners aspartame
and neotame is located in the atd of ht1r2 [22, 64], and
that the binding site for the sweetener cyclamate and the
sweet taste inhibitor lactisole is located in the tmd of
ht1r3 [22, 89]. it seems that the sweet proteins are too large
to fit into the tmd or within the cleft of the closed form of
the atd of the t1rs, suggesting they may have a separate
binding site in the extracellular domain of t1rs. jiang et al.
showed that the crd of ht1r3 and the atd of t1rs is part
of the binding site for the sweet protein brazzein [78]. however, at present it is not clear how brazzein binds to the sweet
taste receptor and whether it shares an overlapping binding
site with other sweet proteins? the same questions also remain for other small molecule sweeteners. do all small
sweeteners bind to these two binding sites of the sweet taste
receptors? which kinds of sweeteners bind to  xxxg2249xxx ’s atd,
which, sweeteners bind to t1r3’s tmd, and how to classify
them? do any sweeteners bind to the atd of t1r3 or the
tmd of  xxxg2249xxx ? are there other regions of the sweet receptors that provide additional binding sites? further experimental and molecular modeling studies should be helpful to
