summary

the dissociation constants between certain benzoquinonium and  xxxd137xxx 
analogs and the acetylcholine receptor were determined with the isolated electroplax;
they were compared with those obtained with acetylcholinesterase purified from the
electric organ of electrophorus electricus.
the compounds are strong competitive and reversible inhibitors of both the
receptor and the esterase. small changes of structure m a y strongly affect their ability
to inhibit the carbamylcholine depolarization of the electroplax. the effects of structural modification on reaction with the receptor differ markedly from those in which
the inhibitory action on acetylcholinesterase is tested. thus, the results offer new
evidence that the active sites of the acetylcholine receptor and of acetylcholinesterase
are different in chemical structure.

introduction

the monocellular electroplax preparation, developed by schoffeniels1 and
further improved b y higman, ]~artels and podleski 2-4, proved to be a most
valuable method for testing the reaction of acetylcholine and related compounds
with the acetylcholine receptor in the intact cell. procedures have been worked out
to measure dissociation constants between the receptor and these compounds 4.
according to theory, acetylcholine acts on a protein, referred to as the acetylcholine receptor, thereby triggering a chain of events resulting in an increased permeability of the excitable membrane. acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetvlcholinesterase and the resting state of the membrane is restored 5. some investigators
believe that the active sites of acetylcholinesterase and the acetylcholine receptor
m a y be the same 6-s. this hypothesis fails to explain why m a n y receptor activators or
inhibitors block electrical activity without affecting acetylcholinesterase, while other
compounds such as physostigmine block electrical activity primarily by blocking
acetylcholinesterase 5,9.
the electroplax offers the possibility of obtaining quantitative data for distinguishing whether the reactions of compounds on the intact membrane m a y be

attributed to the effects on the same site or on two different sites. if small variations
in the molecular structure of several compounds affect their interactions with the
receptor in cell membranes in a way similar to the way in which these variations in
structure affect the interaction of these compounds with acetylcholinesterase in
solution, then the identity of the two sites, and consequently of the two macromolecules, would be supported. if, however, variations of structure result in completely different strengths of interaction, then the existence of two different sites and
possibly of two different macromolecules would be supported. in addition, such studies
m a y provide useful information about the chemical properties of the receptor.
hoppe, funnell and lape1Â° have investigated the actions of a series of benzoquinonium analogs in producing neuromuscular block and in inhibiting erythrocyte
acetylcholinesterase. a similar study of the structure-activity relationships with
a series of  xxxd137xxx  analogs has been reported by lands et al. n. it appeared to
be of interest to determine the dissociation constants for the reaction between these
two types of compounds and the acetylcholine receptor of the monocellular electroplax and to compare them with the dissociation constants measured with a solution
of acetylcholinesterase extracted from electroplax cells, as erythrocyte cholinesterase
may be different from acetylcholinesterase obtained from the electric organ of electrophorus. the results of such studies are reported in this paper.
methods

electroplax studies
the single electroplax from the organ of sachs of electrophorus electricus was
isolated and mounted in a chamber as described previously 1-s. the cells were impaled
through the noninnervated side with a 3 m kc1 filled microelectrode of 7-14 m.o,
resistance, and the potential across the innervated membrane was recorded continuously. often a single impalement could be maintained satisfactorily throughout a
complete experiment. occasionally, however, the changing of solution or some other
disturbance dislodged the electrode. in such cases the electrode was reinserted into
another spot and the experiment was continued. reimpalements usually agreed with
the previously measured transmembrane potential within 2 or 3 mv (unless a depolarizing solution had just been added). if the disagreement was greater than about
4 mv, a third impalement was made.
in all experiments in which an inhibitor ( xxxd137xxx  or benzoquinonium
analog) was used, the cell was incubated first for 30 rain in the same concentration
of inhibitor as that which was employed subsequently in combination with various
concentrations of carbamylcholine. carbamylcholine was used in preference to acetylcholine because it avoided the complication of having to add an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. the  xxxd137xxx  and benzoquinonium compounds were gifts from
drs. r. o. clinton and a. m. lands of the sterling-winthrop research institute
(rensselaer, n.y.). the author is grateful to dr. sara ginsburgwho synthesized the
tertiary benzoquinonium from benzoquinone according to the method of cavallito,
soria and h o p p e 12.

before each experiment the action potential was monitored on an oscilloscope.
both direct and indirect spikes were measured and were distinguished from one another by the method described by podlesk113. any cell with an indirect spike of less

 xxxg2020xxx . in experiments where preincubation was used, 9 ml of solution containing
enzyme and inhibitor were incubated at 30.0 Â° for 30 min and then one ml of acetylcholine-containing solution was added. preincubation was found to be unnecessary
for the inhibitors used in this study and thus was not usually employed.
the enzyme activity usually declined by about 3 % during a day's experiments,
probably because of surface denaturation. the activity was always measured at the
beginning, middle and end of each experiment and appropriate correction factors
were used when calculations from the data were made.
theory

in order to calculate a dissociation constant for an inhibitor it is assumed that
activator (a) molecules combine with receptor (r) sites resulting in a biological response, in this case manifested by a depolarization of the innervated membrane of
the electroplax. it must be assumed that only one molecule of a or of inhibitor (i) m a y
combine with each site and that there is a reversible competition between a and i
for the sites. it is also assumed that combination of i with r does not produce a
response. it is not necessary to assume that the magnitude of the response is linearly
proportional to the number of sites occupied by a, nor is it necessary to assume that
the maximum response occurs only when all the receptor sites are occupied with
activator. it must, however, be assumed that equal responses correspond to an equal
number of sites occupied by a. making these assumptions it is possible to derive the
following equation from the law of mass action:

[i] [a]
k_.,-= ea'] [.a]-

(~)

where ki is the dissociation constant between the inhibitor and the receptor, [a]
is a concentration of activator which gives a particular response when no inhibitor
is present, and [a'] is the concentration of activator which gives the same response
in the presence of a concentration [i 1 of inhibitor. eqn. i was derived in 195o by
van maanen14 for the special case where Â½ of the receptor sites are occupied. however, a derivation which holds true for any equal responses with and without competitive inhibitor is given in the appendix of this paper. equations essentially identical
to eqn. i have been used by jenkinson15 and higman, podleskiand ]3artels4 and
attributed to a 1943 paper by gaddumtm, although some algebraic manipulation is
necessary to derive eqn. i from the equations given in gai)i)um'spaper.
calculating dissociation constants for inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase is
complicated by the fact that this enzyme exhibits substrate inhibition, thus making
the method of lineweaver and burk17 difficult to use. the method of augustinssontm, however, was found to be satisfactory. this method employs the equation:

where v ~ the velocity without inhibitor and v ' z the velocity in the presence of
inhibitor at a concentration of [i1. ks is the dissociation constant for the reaction of
substrate (s) with the enzyme and k1 the dissociation constant for the reaction of the
competitive inhibitor with the enzyme. this equation is easily derived by dividing:

equation for the velocity of an enzymatic reaction in the presence of a competitive

results

the inhibition by benzoquinonium and  xxxd137xxx  analogs of the depolarization of the innervated membrane of the electroplax by carbamylcholine was found
to be competitive and reversible. for example, in fig. i it may be seen that by
increasing the concentration of inhibitor (in this case a derivative of benzoquinonium)
without changing the concentration of activator (carbamylcholine) it is possible to
repolarize a cell already depolarized by activator. also, a cell partially depolarized
by carbamylcholine in the presence of a benzoquinoninm or  xxxd137xxx  analog may
be depolarized further by lowering the inhibitor concentration without changing the
carbamylcholine concentration. carbamylcholine depolarization is easily reversed by
removing the carbamylcholine, whether or not inhibitor is present.

as f o u n d in an earlier s t u d y using this m e t h o d 4, the rate of carbamyleholine depolarization (with or w i t h o u t inhibitor) was n o t very reproducible from cell to cell. however,
the new s t e a d y t r a n s m e m b r a n e p o t e n t i a l which was reached in 5-3o m i n following the
a p p l i c a t i o n of a new solution was fairly reproducible from cell to cell ( s t a n d a r d errors
were in the range of i 4 - i o % of the m e a n s t e a d y potential). u s u a l l y a new steady
p o t e n t i a l was reached sooner with the higher c a r b a m y l e h o l i n e c o n c e n t r a t i o n s t h a n
with the lower (e.g. see fig. i).
plots similar to t h a t in fig. 2 were m a d e for all the other inhibitors tested. a
depolarization to a s t e a d y t r a n s m e m b r a n e p o t e n t i a l of 5o mv was selected as the
" s t a n d a r d " response when calculating the k~ according to e q n . i. other values for
the " s t a n d a r d " response give similar values for k i as long as t h e y are not too near
the initial resting p o t e n t i a l or the m a x i m u m depolarization. the k / s calculated from
the curves o b t a i n e d with the several c o n c e n t r a t i o n s of b e n z o q u i n o n i u m shown in

the agreement was n o t always equally good in t~i's calculated for the other inhibitors,

days were 1.74, 1.7o , 1.79 , and 1.75. therefore it was decided that one set of experiments (with 5 to 7 concentrations of inhibitor tested in each set) was sufficient to
determine the dissociation constant for one inhibitor. k s was found to be 1.29. io-~ m
using lineweaver and ]~urk 17 plots. the inhibitor dissociation constants were
calculated using eqn. 3 and plots like that in fig. 4. the values obtained may be
seen in the last column of table i. approximately the same order of inhibitory
potency was found for these compounds using acetylcholinesterase prepared from
electrophorus electricus as that reported in the earlier studies using dog erythrocyte
cholinesterase~Â°, n. the order was changed slightly, however, in three cases, and the
proportional effectiveness was not always the same.
discussion

the most significant finding of this study was that the compounds tested followed a very different order when considered according to their effectiveness in inhibiting the carbamylcholine depolarization of the electroplax as opposed to their
effectiveness in inhibiting the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase obtained from electroplax cells. for example, the two ambenonimn analogs w i n 13 357
and w i n 3286 differ only in that one has a bromine atom substituted in the 2 position
on the benzyl groups and the other a hydrogen. the dissociation constants for these
two compounds with the receptor differ by about 3-fold. there is a iooo-folddifference,
however, between the dissociation constants of these two compounds with acetylcholinesterase. another striking difference is that benzoquinonium is about iio times more
potent than  xxxd137xxx  in inhibiting the electroplax depolarization, whereas benzoquinonium is about 16o times less potent than  xxxd137xxx  in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase.
examination of table i yields many other examples. therefore it would appear

inhibitor affinities for ach-receptor and -esterase

181

safe to assume that the receptor sites for the depolarization of the electroplax are
different from the receptor sites on acetylcholinesterase involved in the hydrolysis of
acetylcholine.
the dissociation constant for d- xxxd3456xxx  with the receptor was determined
on the electroplax in an earlier study from this laboratory as 2.4" 10-7 m (ref. 4). the
corresponding dissociation constant for benzoquinonium is 1.4" i0 -s m. previous attempts to isolate the acetylcholine receptor protein from electric tissue by precipitation with curare failed because curare was not specific enough 21. the lower dissociation constant of benzoquinonium may indicate a greater specificity of this
compound for the acetylcholine receptor. therefore this compound may be of use in
studies aimed at isolating the receptor protein. the dissociation constants obtained in
this study may be helpful in identifying the receptor protein once it has been isolated.
there are 'some differences between dissociation constants determined with an
enzyme in solution and those tested on intact membranes. it is assumed that carbamylcholine and the benzoquinonium and  xxxd137xxx  analogs are competing for the
same receptor sites and that the combination of carbamylcholine with the receptor
results in depolarization (presumably due to increased ion permeability) whereas
combination of the receptor with inhibitor produces no changes in permeability. this
would be analogous to the competitive action of these compounds for the active sites
of acetylcholinesterase. however, in the case of a membrane, i.e., an organized
structure, it is difficult to ascertain whether the concentrations of activator and
inhibitor are the same in the immediate vicinity of the receptor sites as they are in
the externally applied solution.
recent developments have shown the importance of permeability barriers in
evaluating the effects of compounds on biological membranes. for example, curare
appears to interact with receptor sites in the conducting membrane of nerve fibers,
although it was once believed that curare acts only at motor end plates. normally,
curare does not reach the conducting membrane because of permeability barriers.
under special conditions where permeability barriers are reduced, however, a definite
action of curare m a y be seen. curare when applied directly on a ranvier node of
a. single frog sciatic nerve fiber (where permeability barriers are reduced) blocks conduction reversibly 22. conduction block by curare also occurs after nerves have been
treated with surfactant 2s or snake venom 2~ to reduce permeability barriers. evidence
indicating a possible action of curare on the conducting membrane of muscle after
surfactant treatment has recently been reported 25. the receptor sites involved in
the carbamylcholine depolarization of the electroplax are located at synapses where
most of the tissue surrounding the axons and forming the permeability barriers is
absent. nevertheless, some barriers may be present which impede the penetration
of carbamylcholine and particularly large molecules such as the benzoquinonium or
 xxxd137xxx  analogs.
another factor which must be considered is the effect of an organized structure
on the interaction between micro- and macromolecules. very little information is
available in this respect. however, the studies of bar-eli and katchalski2s and
of katchalski27 with insoluble enzymes have shown the strong effects which positive
or negative charges surrounding the protein m a y have on the reaction: compounds
with opposite charge may be attracted while those with the same charge m a y be
repelled. thereby the local concentration m a y be greatly increased or reduced. indeed,

a 2o-5o-fold increase of the km has been observed with the "insoluble" enzymes
compared to the same enzyme in solution. obviously, in an organized structure in
which the macromolecules are surrounded by other polyelectrolytes this kind of effect
may be important, especially for a reaction of such strongly charged compounds as
benzoquinonium and  xxxd137xxx .
the dissociation constants calculated from the enzyme studies in solutions do
not encounter these difficulties. however, there are some, although minor, uncertainties involved in the calculations. one possible source of error is that substrate
inhibition may have affected to some extent the curves used to calculate the dissociation constants. the calculations are based on the assumption that the benzoquinonium and  xxxd137xxx  derivatives are competitive inhibitors. although evidence was
obtained to indicate that the inhibition was primarily competitive, it is difficult to
rule out completely a noncompetitive component of the inhibition, since some molecules may have interacted with the enzyme by coulombic and van der waals forces
outside the active site. since the same method was used for determining the dissociation constants for all the compounds, the figures obtained are valid for comparing
the relative inhibitory potency of the various compounds.
curves similar to those in fig. 2 were obtained for all of the compounds tested.
as the concentration of carbamylcholine is increased, the transmembrane potential
approaches about 14 mv regardless of the concentration of inhibitor present. thus
a noncompetitive component of the inhibition is not apparent. this is in contrast to
the action of tetracaine. podleski and bartels28 have shown that in addition to
a competitive action at the synapses, tetracaine, which is lipid soluble, acts on the
conducting membrane of the electroplax and therefore competes with acetylcholine
released within the membrane by the depolarizing currents produced at the synapses
by carbamylcholine. at the concentrations used here, no such action occurred with
the quaternary lipid-insoluble benzoquinonium or  xxxd137xxx  compounds, as
evidenced by the strictly competitive nature of their action, which, like that of carbamylcholine, is limited to the synapse.
