 xxxd1701xxx , a novel calcimimetic compound, is effective in
reducing  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) levels in approximately 70% of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. however, interindividual variations in the dose
required to achieve the treatment goal have been noted in
clinical studies. our investigation examined the genetic
polymorphisms of the  xxxg343xxx  ( xxxg343xxx )
gene as one possible cause of the different responses to
 xxxd1701xxx . we report data on seven end-stage renal failure
patients who were treated with regular haemodialysis and
who participated in clinical trials of  xxxd1701xxx . all patients
had secondary hyperparathyroidism with baseline intact
pth (ipth) levels greater than 600 pg/ml. three patients
were male and four female with a mean ± sd age of 60 ± 12
years. dna was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes. an
area in exon 7 of the  xxxg343xxx  gene was amplified by the
polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. mean ± sd
baseline ipth was 1086 ± 189 pg/ml. the five patients
without arg990gly demonstrated a 29.7 ± 4.0% ( ± sem)
reduction in ipth from individual baseline. one patient was
found to be homozygous for the arg990gly polymorphism
and another was heterozygous for both arginine and
glycine alleles. the homozygous patient showed a sig-

nificantly higher sensitivity to  xxxd1701xxx  compared to the
other patients (p = 0.003) with a 76.3 ± 7.7% reduction in
ipth from baseline. no polymorphisms were noted in
codons 986 or 1011. this preliminary study points to the
possibility that patients homozygous for glycine at the 990
position in exon 7 of the  xxxg343xxx  may be more sensitive to
the calcimimetic drug  xxxd1701xxx  compared to those who
are homozygous for arginine at that location. pharmacoc 2005 lippincott

introduction

allosterically alters the  xxxg343xxx  ( xxxg343xxx )
[3], thereby leading to responses as if hypercalcaemia was
present, in the face of normal or even low serum calcium
levels. in other words, the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  binding to
the  xxxg343xxx  is to cause a leftward shift of the set point.

 xxxg1885xxx  (pth) gene transcription in the
parathyroid gland chief cells is tightly regulated by 1,25
(oh)2d3 (calcitriol) via the  xxxg2412xxx . however, secretion of pth is modulated by the plasma
calcium level via the  xxxg343xxx . this
receptor is not only present on parathyroid gland cells,
but also in the kidney, bone, brain, intestine, pancreas
and other tissues. the relationship between ca2 + and
pth can be expressed as an inverse sigmoid curve.
within a narrow range of calcium concentrations around
the set point, very slight decreases in calcium concentrations will trigger a sharp rise in serum pth, whereas a
slight increase in calcium rapidly decreases serum pth
levels. the set point for calcium regulated pth release is
the calcium concentration at which pth levels are
midway between the maximum and minimum pth
values achieved [1].
 xxxd1701xxx  hcl, a novel calcimimetic compound, has
been shown to be effective in reducing pth levels in
secondary hyperparathyroidism regardless of baseline
levels of pth and dialysis modality [2].  xxxd1701xxx  hcl

three genetic polymorphisms (i.e. variations in the
nucleotide sequence) have been described in exon 7 of
the  xxxg343xxx  gene. this exon encodes the c-terminal
intracellular portion of the receptor molecule, which
activates a g-protein cascade, leading in turn to
phospholipase c activation and  xxxg67xxx  inhibition
[4]. all three are single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp)
in that they differ from the common variant by one
nucleotide resulting in a change in one amino acid in the
receptor molecule.
there is evidence that these polymorphisms may have
clinical importance. one of them (arg990gly) was found
to result in a change in the sensitivity of the  xxxg343xxx  to
calcium. yokoyama et al. [5] studied the response of the
parathyroid glands to moderate hypercalcaemia in 77 endstage renal disease (esrd) patients. they found a

subgroup of five patients with arginine at position 990.
this group of patients showed no significant suppression
of their serum pth concentrations at moderate hypercalcaemic levels that were sufficient to cause suppression
in 33 other patients who had glycine in the same position
[5]. the remaining 39 patients were heterozygous for
both alleles and also failed to significantly suppress pth.
in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the presence of arg990gly may predict a less severe course of
the disease: yamauchi et al. [6] studied 105 japanese
patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and found
that the subgroup with the arg990gly phenotype had
significantly lower pth and alkaline phosphatase compared to patients who had arginine at position 990 [6].
the authors’ hypothesis was that the severity and clinical
course of hyperparathyroidism is influenced by the amino
acid makeup of  xxxg343xxx  because  xxxg343xxx  molecules with
glycine at position 990 appear to be more effective in
suppressing pth secretion at hypercalcaemic levels than
molecules with arginine in the same position.
the second polymorphism, ala986ser, has been reported
to be associated with increased serum calcium concentration in healthy adult women [7]. in 163 healthy
women in toronto, this polymorphism was found in 43
heterozygous and five homozygous individuals, whose
corrected total serum calcium concentrations were higher
compared to women without the polymorphism. this
association was independent of ph, phosphate and
 xxxg1885xxx , suggesting an altered activity of
the  xxxg343xxx  in individuals with this polymorphism.
miedlich et al. [8] suggested that the presence of the
third polymorphism glu1011gln might influence the
clinical course of primary hyperparathyroidism (phpt)
because they found heterozygous patients with phpt
and this variant to have significantly higher serum
calcium and  xxxg1885xxx  levels compared to
phpt patients without the polymorphism. pratt et al. [9]
found this polymorphism to be three times more common

table 1

in african-americans than in caucasian-americans, but
found no association of any of the three polymorphisms
with a higher incidence of arterial hypertension.
we encountered significant interindividual variance in
the response to  xxxd1701xxx  when treating haemodialysis
patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with  xxxd1701xxx  hcl in phase ii and iii studies. accordingly, we
conducted the present pilot study. we determined the
nucleotide sequences of exon 7 of the  xxxg343xxx  gene. our
investigation concentrated on genetic polymorphisms of
the  xxxg343xxx  gene as one possible cause of these differences
in the response to  xxxd1701xxx  hcl.

materials and methods
subjects

seven esrd patients who were treated with haemodialysis three times per week, and who were participating in
the clinical trials and receiving  xxxd1701xxx  hcl, were
included in the present study after providing their
written informed consent. all patients had secondary
hyperparathyroidism with baseline intact pth (ipth)
levels greater than 600 pg/ml. three patients were male
and four female with a mean age of 60 ± 12 years
(table 1). table 2 shows concomitant therapy with
vitamin d analogues and phosphate binders.
protocol

all patients were initially treated with 30 mg of  xxxd1701xxx 
hcl orally once per day, with the option to increase the
dose later to 60, 90, 120 and subsequently 180 mg to meet
ipth treatment targets (ipth between 150 and 300 pg/
ml). the cumulative doses were verified by pill-counting
on a weekly basis. patients were analysed during the first
2 months of  xxxd1701xxx  hcl therapy. table 2 shows the
concomitant therapy with vitamin d and sevelamer. no
other phosphate binders were used. dialysate calcium
concentration was 2.5 meq/l throughout the duration of
the study. the patients took  xxxd1701xxx  hcl with their
main meals between 17.00 and 20.00 h. blood samples for
ipth were drawn immediately before haemodialysis.

 xxxd79xxx / xxxd2245xxx  in the sense sequence corresponds to cytosin/thymin in the antisense sequence (a, adenine; g, guanine; c, cytosine; t, thymine).

analytical methods

amplification method

calcium and phosphorus levels were determined on a
roche modular (colorimetric method) (roche diagnostics gmbh, mannheim, germany). intact pth was
measured using the nichols advantage method (an
immunometric chemiluminescense test) (nichols institute diagnostics, san clemente, california, usa).

this was performed as described by miedlich et al. [8]
with slight modifications. amplification was performed
with taq dna polymerase (roche diagnostics) in a perkin
elmer amplifier (perkin elmer geneamp pcr system
2400, norwalk, cincinnati, usa), using the following
primers: 50 -cagaaggtcatctttggcagcggca-30
(forward) and 50 -tcttcctcagaggaaaggagtctgg-30 (reverse). the amplification method was
921c for 3 min, then 25 cycles of 951c to 681c to 721c
(30 s each) and 721c for 10 min. after amplification, the
samples were sent for sequencing to genewiz, inc.
(www.genewiz.com), using both a sense and an antisense
primer. all findings at snp codons were verified by cross
checking with the corresponding antisense sequence
(fig. 1). chromatograms were visualized using the
chromas 2 program from technelysium ptv ltd
(www.technelysium.com.au).

genotyping

the amino acid makeup of each of the three known snp
positions was determined. dna was then extracted from
lymphocytes. two 5-ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(edta) tubes of blood were drawn before starting
dialysis and plasma and cells separated by 10 min of
centrifugation at 1100 g. the fraction containing lymphocytes and platelets was separated from  xxxd187xxx  and
granulocytes by gradient centrifugation with  xxxd3253xxx 
paque plus (amersham biosciences, uppsala, sweden).
dna extraction from the cell suspension was
performed using a genomic dna purification kit
(wizard, promega, madison, wisconsin, usa). the
process includes cell lysis, incubation with rnase,
protein precipitation and finally dna precipitation with
isopropanol and 70% ethanol. the resulting dna
preparation was dissolved in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  plus
1 mm edta and stored at –201c.

statistical analysis

statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism
2.0. executable (graphpad prism, san diego, california,
usa). differences in the percentage decline from
baseline ipth values and in the cumulative doses per
1.73 m2 body surface area were evaluated by one-way
analysis of variance. tukey’s multiple comparison test was

employed as a post test to compare all patients with each
other on an individual basis.

results
serum phosphorus and corrected total calcium levels are
shown in table 1. mean ± sd baseline ipth was
1086 ± 500 pg/ml with an upper 95% confidence limit
(cl) of 1548 and a lower 95% cl of 624. the
mean ± sd ipth for patients 1–5 was 1229 ± 533 pg/
ml. all patients responded to  xxxd1701xxx  hcl by a
reduction in ipth (fig. 2). five patients with arginine
at position 990 demonstrated a 29.7 ± 4.0% ( ± sem)
reduction in ipth from individual baseline. one patient
demonstrated a 76.3% ± 7.7% decrease in ipth, with a
88.8 ± 0.5% decrease between weeks 1 and 5. this
patient (patient 6) was homozygous for glycine at
position 990 (glygly). another patient (patient 7) was
heterozygous for both alleles (arggly). no polymorphisms were noted in codons 986 or 1011 (table 3).
figure 2 shows the percentage suppression of ipth over
the 2 months duration of treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  hcl
for all seven patients. data for the five patients with
arginine at position 990 are summarized by mean ± sd.
the difference in percentage decline from baseline ipth
values between patient 6 and the other six patients was
significant (p = 0.003). tukey’s multiple comparison test
shows that pth suppression was significantly (p < 0.05)
less in each of the five patients with arginine at position
990 compared individually to that of patient 6, who was

homozygous for glycine in the same position. the only
patient for whom the difference from patient 6 was not
significant was patient 7, who was heterozygous. however, the percentage decline in ipth values of patient 7
was not significantly different from those of each of the
five patients homozygous for arginine at position 990.
this difference in response to  xxxd1701xxx  hcl was not
dose-dependent. from week 3 to the end of the study,
patient 6 received the lowest cumulative dose of
 xxxd1701xxx  hcl, totalling 1019 mg/1.73 m2 body surface
area (bsa) in 8 weeks compared to 2452 ( ± 447
sem) mg/1.73 in patients 1–5 and 2883 mg/1.73 m2 bsa
in patient 7. differences in the cumulative doses of
 xxxd1701xxx  hcl were not statistically significant.

discussion
we studied the decrease in ipth levels over a period of
8 weeks in seven haemodialysis patients treated with the
calcimimetic agent  xxxd1701xxx  hcl. our data show that
one patient (patient 6) demonstrated a greater decrease
in ipth during  xxxd1701xxx  hcl therapy compared to
patients 1–5, despite being on a markedly lower dose of
the calcimimetic agent. this patient demonstrated a
76.3 ± 7.7% decrease in ipth compared to a 29.7 ± 4.0%
decrease in patients 1–5. we explored the possibility that
this difference in response to  xxxd1701xxx  hcl was related
to genetic polymorphisms of the  xxxg343xxx  gene by analysing
the amino acid composition of the receptor at exon 7, an
area for which three polymorphisms have previously been
described. the results show that patient 6 is homozygous
for the arg990gly polymorphism, whereas patients 1–5
are homozygous for arginine at position 990. when the
mean percentage decrease in ipth of patient 6 was
compared with each of the patients 1–5, each test showed
a significantly greater decrease in ipth in patient 6 in
response to  xxxd1701xxx  hcl (p < 0.05). patient 7 was
noted to be heterozygous. her mean percentage decrease
in ipth was not significantly different from that of
patient 6, or any one of patients 1–5.
the replacement of arginine by glycine at position 990 of
the  xxxg343xxx , as it occurs in patient 6 who is asian, is a
common polymorphism in that racial group. in a study of
77 japanese esrd patients yokoyama et al. [5] identified
33 (43%) homozygous patients with the arg990gly
polymorphism compared to five (6%) patients homozygous for arginine (identical to patients 1–5 in our
cohort) and 39 (51%) heterozygous patients (identical to

patient 7). when the dialysis bath calcium concentration
was raised from 2.5 to 3.0 meq/l, this hypercalcaemic
stimulus resulted in a decrease in serum pth levels in
patients with the glycine polymorphism, but not in those
patients who were homozygous for arginine, nor in the
heterozygous group. this response suggests that the
presence of glycine molecules at position 990 alters the
receptor, making it more sensitive to calcium, and that
this is similar to the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  hcl. in the study
by yokoyama et al. [5], this resulted in a decrease in
secretion of pth in these patients but not in those
individuals with receptors containing an arginine molecule at that position. there was no difference in receptor
sensitivity between those patients who were homozygous
for arginine and the heterozygous group in this study.
it could be argued that the increase in sensitivity to
calcium of the  xxxg343xxx  containing glycine molecules at
position 990, as shown in the study by yokoyama et al. [5],
corresponds to our finding of increased sensitivity to the
calcimimetic agent  xxxd1701xxx  hcl in patient 6. the
increased sensitivity to calcium would result in a greater
decrease in ipth, which was seen in that patient. of
interest, and as discussed above, the heterozygous patient
7 (containing both alleles for glycine and arginine at
position 990 in her diploid genome) was the only
individual whose decrease in ipth was not significantly
different from patient 6, nor was it significantly different
compared to those patients who were homozygous for
arginine.
there is evidence that polymorphisms of the calciumsensing receptor, with their associated alteration of its set
point, lead to phenotypic consequences not only in the
parathyroid chief cell, but also in other organs. in their
study of  xxxg343xxx  located on the tubular cells of the kidney,
vezzoli et al. [10] examined 230 healthy caucasian subjects
and found that the majority of them had arginine at
position 990. fifteen subjects, who had glycine at position
990 (arg990gly snp), demonstrated a significantly
increased incidence of hypercalciuria compared to the
arginine group. these results could be interpreted as
indicating that the arg990gly polymorphism facilitates
activation of the  xxxg343xxx  in renal tubular cells, increasing
calcium excretion and leading to idiopathic hypercalciuria.
other point mutations in the c-terminal intracellular tail
of the receptor molecule have been found to influence
the function of  xxxg343xxx . point mutation thr876asp, which
was identified in several canadian families with familial
hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, causes a significantly lower degree of
sensitivity to calcium than the wild-type receptor [11].
the intracellular portion of these receptor molecules is
truncated at position 876 after insertion of an alu
repetitive element and intracellular signalling is lost

[7]. in a study performed in vitro, mutant casrs
truncated at residues 865, 874 and 877 were expressed
in xenopus laevis oocytes. these receptors showed no
response to calcium despite normal or higher than normal
receptor expression [12]. these results suggest that the
c-tail plays an important part in the receptor function.
it should be stressed that there could be other genotypic/
phenotypic characteristics of calcium-sensing that are
specific to the asian population, resulting in more
pronounced ipth-suppression in response to  xxxd1701xxx 
hcl. there could also be differences in the metabolism
of the calcimimetic drug by the cytochrome p-450 1a2
and 3a4 enzymes (the major metabolic route), and
patient 6 may have had higher plasma levels of the drug
despite receiving smaller doses. in a study by huang et al.
[13], a wide interindividual variation of cytochrome p450
la2 ( xxxg576xxx ) activity was found in chinese individuals;
however, only one polymorphism (out of 157 patients)
was found, which did not result in a markedly decreased
activity. therefore, there is no strong evidence to suggest
a decreased cytochrome p-450 1a2 activity in the asian
population. to date, no literature is available with respect
to cyp3a4 in asians.
the present study was only a preliminary investigation
with very small numbers of patients, but it does indicate
the possibility that patients who are homozygous or
perhaps heterozygous for glycine at the 990 position in
codon 7 of the  xxxg343xxx  gene may be more sensitive to the
action of the drug  xxxd1701xxx  hcl than those who are
homozygous for arginine at that location. a larger study
with  xxxd1701xxx  hcl plasma level measurements, and a
more rigorous method of assessing the response to
 xxxd1701xxx  hcl, is currently under way. it would be of
clinical importance to delineate those groups that have an
exaggerated response to this potent drug to avoid
oversuppression of the parathyroid gland.
