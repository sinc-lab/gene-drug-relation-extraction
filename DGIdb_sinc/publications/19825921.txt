abstract
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) is a life-threatening immune response to heparin that is associated with a high risk
of thromboembolic complications. the syndrome is caused by antibodies that are reactive against complexes of platelet factor
4/heparin ( xxxg1726xxx /h). for patients with hit, the discontinuation of heparin alone is not sufficient and the diagnosis necessitates the
administration of an alternative anticoagulant. fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that binds to antithrombin and potentiates inhibition of  xxxg741xxx . data have shown that fondaparinux is structurally too short to induce an antibody response and could
be a useful agent to treat hit. in our hospital, we retrospectively analyzed the use of fondaparinux in the treatment of 24 patients
with acute hit during unfractionated heparin (ufh) or  xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh) administration and compared the
results to a similar population of 20 patients who were treated with  xxxd2455xxx . the treated patients had a complete platelet count
recovery, and none experienced a new thromboembolic complication or major bleeding. the development of limb gangrene
(2 patients who received  xxxd2455xxx  and 1 who received fondaparinux) likely resulted from a delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation. our data suggest that fondaparinux may be considered a safe and an effective alternative treatment in hit complicated with
or without thrombosis.

introduction
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) is a life- and limbthreatening immune response to heparin that is associated
with a high risk of thromboembolic complications.1-3 it is
caused by immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies against the
 xxxg1726xxx /heparin ( xxxg1726xxx /h) complex, resulting both
thrombocytopenia and a hypercoagulable state. venous or
arterial thromboembolic complications will develop in 30%
to 75% of patients with hit unless they are treated with an
alternative anticoagulant. current guidelines recommend the use
of either direct thrombin inhibitors (direct thrombin inhibitors
(dtis),  xxxd2455xxx , and  xxxd218xxx ) or heparinoids (danaparoid)
for patients with suspected or confirmed hit.2,4 unfortunately,
the usefulness of the dtis is limited mainly by the need for continuous intravenous infusions, frequent activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) monitoring, and prolongation of the
international normalized ratio (inr), which complicates transitioning patients to  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists.5,6 furthermore, among
these agents, only  xxxd2455xxx  is available in greece. hence, other
hit treatment options are essential.
fondaparinux is a selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor via the action
of antithrombin that is administered once daily by the subcutaneous route for the prophylaxis and treatment in a number of

thrombotic disorders (especially as thromboprophylaxis in
orthopedic patients), without monitoring.
considering the published data and its properties,7-10 fondaparinux provided to us a reasonable alternative anticoagulant to
heparin. moreover, fondaparinux received a level 2c recommendation for use in the treatment of hit in the recent consensus conference of the american college of chest physicians
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (eighth edition).2
in the current study, we report the successful use of fondaparinux in the treatment of 24 patients with acute hit.

patients and methods
we retrospectively analyzed the use of fondaparinux for the
treatment of 24 patients diagnosed with acute hit during
unfractionated heparin (ufh) or low-molecular-weight
heparin (lmwh) administration between january 2003 and

clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis 16(6)

january 2008 in our hospital, also comparing this group of
patients to a similar cohort of 20 hit individuals treated with
 xxxd2455xxx  at the same period. analysis was performed with a retrospective chart review of total hospitalized patients to identify
all hit cases. inpatients suspected to have hit were referred to
haemostasis—blood bank integral department, where we
assessed hit diagnosis via proper clinical and laboratory investigation and subsequently designated patients’ treatment and
follow-up.  xxxd2455xxx  was used mainly during the first 2 years
of the study, when fondaparinux was available afterward. all
patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of hit as defined by
warkentin.3 according to the criteria mentioned above, all
patients had a decrease in platelet count by 50% compared to
pretreatment values, between day 4 to day 14 of heparin administration, even if platelet count nadir remained greater than
150  109/l, with or without a new arterial or venous thromboembolic complication. no other cause of thrombocytopenia
or platelet count fall was evident. platelet count recovered within
3 to 8 days after heparin discontinuation.
the end points for comparisons between the 2 groups were
defined platelets count recovery, complication rates, and successful bridging to  xxxd59xxx . complications were
defined as death, limp amputation, new thromboembolic complications, venous limb gangrene, or major bleeding. bleeding
events were considered major if they were clinically overt and
associated with a decrease of 2 g/dl or more in the hemoglobin
level, led to the transfusion of 2 or more units of  xxxd187xxx  or
whole blood, were retroperitoneal or intracranial, occurred in
a critical organ, or contributed to death. other episodes of clinically overt bleeding were classified as minor.
the laboratory diagnosis of hit in all patients was serologically supported by the  xxxg1726xxx /h complex enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay ( xxxg1726xxx /h elisa; asserachrom, stago,
france) and by particle gel immunoassay id- xxxg1726xxx /h-pagia
(diamed, switzerland), both run according to the manufacturer’s specifications. a sample was considered elisa positive
if the optical density (od) at 410 nm was greater than 0.40.
the id- xxxg1726xxx /h-pagia is a semiquantitative, simple rapid test
that detects  xxxg1726xxx /h-antibodies.
quantitative variables are expressed as mean + standard
deviation and were compared by mann-whitney test,
while categorical variables were compared using the w2 test
(spss-14 for ibm pc; chicago, illinois). a 2-tailed p value
of less than .05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

results
tables 1 and 2 summarize the patients’ clinical data. in total, 18
of them were males and 26 females. the platelet count of all
patients before heparin administration was normal in both
groups. the mean platelet count nadir was 109  109/l in
group of fondaparinux and 50  109/l in group of  xxxd2455xxx .
it is worthy of note that 2 patients treated with fondaparinux
had essential thrombocythemia, and hit was diagnosed in the
absence of an absolute thrombocytopenia; if these 2 patients

are excluded, the mean platelet count nadir of the remaining
22 patients treated with fondaparinux is 66  109/l. the average time of onset of thrombocytopenia was 7.3 days versus 7.1
after the commencement of heparin anticoagulation. the
patients were taking ufh or lmwh for the treatment of
venous thromboembolism and lmwh as thromboprophylaxis.
in fondaparinux group, the majority of them had undergone
various orthopedic operations or had multitrauma, while 3 of
them were medical patients. the patients of  xxxd2455xxx  group
were likewise diagnosed. new thromboembolic complications
associated with hit were identified in 14 patients in fondaparinux group versus 19 in the second group. in both the groups,
the remaining patients had an initial thrombosis that led to
heparin treatment. thus, all 44 study patients had documented
thrombosis either before beginning ufh or lmwh treatment
(n ¼ 11) or as a complication of hit (n ¼ 33). in all cases, ufh
or lmwh was discontinued and patients were treated with
daily subcutaneous injections of weight-based fondaparinux
therapeutic regiment, or  xxxd2455xxx  as soon as the recognition
of the syndrome was made. given that none of our patients had
renal impairment and all had thrombosis, fondaparinux was
given once daily in 5 mg if body weight was less than 50 kg;
7.5 mg if body weight was between 50 and 100 kg or 10 mg
if body weight was greater than 100 kg. in the second group,
intravenous continuous  xxxd2455xxx  infusion was given in dose
0.15 mg/kg per hour adjusted according to aptt (maintaining
aptt 2-3 times the baseline value), without a bolus.
additionally,  xxxd2207xxx  g (ivigg) was
given to 9 patients because of severe thrombocytopenia (mean
platelet count nadir 18  109/l). furthermore, lower limb
amputation because of venous gangrene was required in 1
patient before the beginning of fondaparinux versus 2 in  xxxd2455xxx  group. the development of limb gangrene in both groups
may have been a result of delayed recognition of hit. both
 xxxg1726xxx /h-elisa and id- xxxg1726xxx /h-pagia tests were positive in all
the patients.  xxxg1726xxx /h-elisa mean-od were 1.4 +
0.6 in fondaparinux group versus 1.5 + 0.7 in  xxxd2455xxx  group
(p > .05). furthermore, id- xxxg1726xxx /h-pagia was strongly positive
in all the cases. the laboratory diagnosis was made together
with the clinical diagnosis in 32 patients and after the commencement of alternative anticoagulation in 12 patients. it is
worth noting that the mean od value (þsd) of the elisa was
significantly higher in those patients with a new hitassociated thrombosis versus the patients who only had documented thrombosis prior to starting heparin or lmwh (1.98
+ 0.87 [n ¼ 33] vs 0.98 + 0.48 [n ¼ 11], p ¼ .03).
all patients responded with the platelet count normalizing
between 1 and 9 days after initiation of fondaparinux versus
1 and 8 days after initiation of  xxxd2455xxx . in all the patients, oral
anticoagulation with  xxxd59xxx  was initiated when the
platelet count was >150  109/l. fondaparinux was discontinued when inr was 2.0 for 2 consecutive days. while platelet
count had returned to normal, 1 patient of fondaparinux group
and 2 patients of  xxxd2455xxx  group died from causes not related to
hit. the 41 surviving patients were being followed in the
thrombosis clinic and took the long-term oral anticoagulation

(6-18 months or lifelong). there were no episodes of major
bleeding or recurrent thrombosis during the mean follow-up
period of 2 years.

discussion
although lmwh has continued to replace ufh over the years,
hit remains a common medical problem, because the absolute
number of hospitalized patients exposed either to ufh or to
lmwh is enormous. mortality due to thromboembolic complications is from 18% to 50% without treatment.2,11,12 therefore, patients with hit require a safe anticoagulant because the
thrombotic process continues after the cessation of heparin.
although fondaparinux is identical in structure to the
antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide domain of heparin, it
does not bind to  xxxg1726xxx  in such a way that promotes binding of
hit antibodies, that is, fondaparinux—unlike ufh and
lmwh—does not usually ‘‘cross-react’’ with hit antibodies
using in vitro platelet activation assays or  xxxg1726xxx -dependent
immunoassays.9,10 no episodes of hit were reported in the
large phase 2 and 3 clinical program,7,8 which is consistent with

the fact that, in vitro, fondaparinux did not cross-react with hit
antibodies.9 it has also been shown not to stimulate platelets
serotonin release or activate platelets in the presence of sera
from patients with hit.10 fondaparinux has an average halflife of 18 hours, making it suitable for once-daily administration. it has a linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile.
the risk of major bleeding from fondaparinux was not found
to be significantly higher than lmwh when used in prevention
or treatment of venous thromboembolism (at 2.5 and 7.5 mg/d,
respectively) in patients without renal impairment.
in our study, all 24 patients with hit who were treated with
fondaparinux met our criteria for a successful outcome, that is,
they had platelet count recovery without new or progressive
thrombosis during a mean follow-up of 2 years. no hemorrhagic or other adverse effects were observed (although none of
our patients had renal impairment). the overlapping use of  xxxd59xxx  and fondaparinux did not result in major bleeding
or venous limb gangrene (although 3 patients had venous limb
gangrene prior to initiated fondaparinux or  xxxd2455xxx ). a limitation our study may be our reliance on the anti- xxxg1726xxx /h elisa
and id- xxxg1726xxx /h-pagia to support the diagnosis of hit, as there

is a potential for ‘‘overdiagnosis’’ of hit using these assays.
however, most of our patients had relatively high od values
in the elisa, and all had thrombosis (with the majority of
patients developing new thrombosis in association with thrombocytopenia). these findings are consistent with the results
reported by zwicker et al13 (who identified that higher elisa
od values significantly correlate with thrombosis) and warkentin et al14 (who identified that the risk of hit antibodies,
defined as a strong-positive platelet serotonin-release assay
[sra] result (50% serotonin release) correlates with the magnitude of elisa od values), suggesting that at least a large
majority—if not all—of our study patients likely had hit.
furthermore, according to a recent study,15 the combination
of id- xxxg1726xxx /h-pagia with the clinical score (thrombocytopenia,
timing, thrombosis, other causes of thrombocytopenia not evident; 4t’s) permits a safe a practical rapid hit diagnosis.
our data, as well as few case reports, small case series, and a
prospective pilot study from the literature16-22 suggest that fondaparinux may be considered a safe and effective alternative
treatment in hit complicated by active thrombosis. to our
knowledge, this is the biggest case series of hit patients
treated successfully with fondaparinux. however, 1 case report

of fondaparinux-related thrombocytopenia and thrombosis,23
another of fondaparinux-associated thrombocytopenia in a previous lmwh-hit patients,24 and a third case of in vivo and in
vitro cross-reactivity of hit antibodies to fondaparinux,25
highlight the fact that its safety needs to be further elucidated.
