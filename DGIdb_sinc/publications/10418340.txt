inhibition of rat adjuvant-induced
arthritis by ginkgetin, a biflavone
from  xxxd2199xxx  leaves

respectively, on 16 days after adjuvant injection. prednisolone

(5 mg/kg/day) showed 79% inhibition. however, no significant antiarthritic activity of ginkgetin could be detected by
oral administration at doses of 5—20mg/kg/day (data not

vant produced massive inflammation at the joint spaces with

without erosion and infiltration of inflammatory cells (fig. 3).

when body and organ weights were measured (table 1),
ginkgetiri slightly decreased the body weight, but the decrease (9.0%) was less than those of the adjuvant- or the

abstract: ginkgetin, a biflavone isolated from  xxxd2199xxx 
leaves, was previously reported as an inhibitor of group ii  xxxg1759xxx . in this study, ginkgetin was evaluated for in vivo
antiarthritic and analgesic activities. ginkgetin (10—20 mg/kg!
day) strongly reduced arthritic inflammation in an animal model
of rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (86% inhibition at 16 days at a
dose of 20 mg/kg/day) via intraperitoneal injection, while prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) showed 79% reduction. histological examination of the knee joints confirmed our findings. when analgesic activity was measured, ginkgetin showed a dose-dependent inhibition in an animal model of acetic acid-induced writhing.

in the adjuvant-treated animals, thymus involution (54.3 %
reduction) and splenomegaly (3.7 fold increase) were observed compared with those of the normal control group.
prednisolone further decreased thymus weights (66.1 %).
however, a reversal of thymus weight was observed in the
ginkgetin-treated animals in comparison with thymus weight
of the adjuvant-treated animals. in addition, ginkgetin did not
produce a reduction of spleen weight as seen in the predniso-

lone-treated animals. these results suggested that antiar-

thritic activity of ginkgetin was not due to stimulation of
pituitary-adrenal axis. it is thought that ginkgetin reduces
arthritic inflammation by different action mechanism(s) from
the conventional steroid, prednisolone.

3.8 mg/kg, respectively. all these results indicate that ginkgetin
may be a potential antiarthritic agent having analgesic activity.

when analgesic activity was examined using acetic acidinduced writhing test, ginkgetin showed potent analgesic
activity by intraperitoneal injection (fig.4). ed50 values for

flavonoids are widely distributed polyphenol compounds in
the plant kingdom. some flavonoids derivatives were previ-

ed50 values for ginkgetin and indomethacin were 8.9 and

ously reported to possess anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory activities in vitro and in vivo (1 —3). among the
flavonoid derivatives, biflavonoids are flavonoid-dimers connected by a c-o-c or c-c bond, and their several biological
activities were described previously (4, 5). biflavonoids such
as ochnaflavone, amentoflavone and ginkgetin (fig.1) were

(5pla2) from rat platelets (6) and similar results were also
obtained with morellotlavone (7). furthermore, ginkgetin and
its isomer, isoginkgetin, inhibited the release of arachidonic
acid/metabolites from rat peritoneal macrophages stimulated
by  xxxd2925xxx  or calcium ionophore, a-23187 (8) and also

inhibited lymphocyte proliferation induced by t- or b-cell
mitogen (9). taken together, data from the above studies
strongly suggest that ginkgetin may possess antiarthritic
activity in vivo. therefore, antiarthritic and analgesic activities
of ginkgetin were examined in this investigation.

when an animal model of chronic inflammation, rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, was employed, ginkgetin showed significant reduction of arthritic inflammation at doses of 10—

8.9 mg/kg, respectively. therefore, it is clearly demonstrated

that ginkgetiri possesses the inhibitory activity of chronic
inflammation with potent analgesic activity.
although several in vitro biological activities of biflavonoids
were reported concerning inflammation and/or immunoregulation (4—12), a few in vivo studies have been described.
amentoflavone and several other biflavones were found to
possess anti-inflammatory activity on animal models of acute
inflammation by topical or intraperitoneal administration (13,
14). morelloflavone, a flavone-flavanone dimer from garcinia
spicata, reduced mouse ear edema induced by phorbol 12-

 xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (7). however, there has been no report
showing anti-inflammatory activity of biflavonoids on chronic
inflammation. herein we demonstrated that ginkgetin possessed potent antiarthritic activity based on the reduction of

paw volume and histologic comparisons. this is the first
report of biflavonoids showing anti-inflammatory activity in a
chronic inflammatory animal model.

modified procedure of the previously described method (16).
compounds finely suspended in 0.1 % carboxymethyl cellulose
(cmc) were intraperitoneally injected each day starting from 0
day. animals of control group (non-adjuvant treated normal
and adjuvant treated control) also received the same amount of
0.1 % cmc solution without compounds intraperitoneally. swelling of the treated right paws and the untreated left paws was
measured using plethysmometer (ugo basile, italy) and swelling of the untreated left paws between 12 and 20 days after
injection of adjuvant was regarded as an arthritic inflammation.
percent inhibition was calculated based on the differences of

swelling after subtracting the hind paw volume of the nonadjuvant treated normal rats from those of the adjuvant-treated

rats with vehicle only or the compound-injected adjuvanttreated rats. for comparison of histological difference, groups of
animals were sacrificed at 25 days after adjuvant injection and

left paws were excised. samples were fixed in formalin and
declacified, followed by paraffin imbedding. knee joint space
was observed after hematoxylin and eosin (h & e) staining. in a
separate experiment, groups of animals were sacrificed at 18
days after adjuvant injection, and changes of body and organ
weights were measured.
