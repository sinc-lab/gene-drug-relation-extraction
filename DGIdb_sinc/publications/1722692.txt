1 the cardiovascular effects of the proprietary cold remedies, mu-cron and boots cold
relief tablets were compared with 'placebo' boots pain relief tablets in a doubleblind study involving 16 healthy volunteers. measurements (impedance cardiography,
forearm plethysmography) were made over 4 h after oral drug administration.
2 two mu-cron tablets (containing  xxxd2921xxx  [(lr,2s)- plus (1s,2r)norephedrine] 50 mg) increased blood pressure (maximal effect 18 ± 1/8 ± 1 mm hg
(mean ± s.e. mean), p < 0.001), stroke volume (4.9 ± 0.8 ml m2, p < 0.05), total
peripheral resistance (243 ± 27 dyn s cm-5 m2, p < 0.001) and forearm vascular
resistance (1.3 ± 0.3 mm hg ml-' min, p < 0.01) and reduced the ratio of pre-ejection
period to ventricular ejection time (-0.031 ± 0.003, p < 0.05) and forearm blood
flow (-2.6 ± 0.5 ml min-', p < 0.05) but did not affect heart rate or cardiac index.
3 two boots cold relief tablets (containing phenylephrine 10 mg and caffeine 60 mg)
caused a small and short-lived increase in total peripheral resistance but did not have
consistent effects on other measurements. two boots pain relief tablets (containing
caffeine 60 mg) did not have important cardiovascular effects.
4 the cardiovascular effects of  xxxd2921xxx , including vasoconstriction and an
increase in cardiac performance, are consistent with its ac- and 13l-adrenoceptor
agonist action. while it may help the symptoms of rhinitis, its use in patients with heart
disease or hypertension is hazardous. clear warnings to this effect should be placed
on the packaging.
5 although more potent than  xxxd2921xxx  when given intravenously, oral
phenylephrine has minimal cardiovascular effects, probably because of poor bioavailability, and is therefore unlikely to be of therapeutic value. as it is a hazard to patients
receiving  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors its use is proprietary cold remedies should be
discontinued.

introduction

drug (horowitz et al., 1980; lake et al., 1988; pentel et
al., 1985), while in others minimal changes in blood
pressure have been observed (blackburn et al., 1989;
goodman et al., 1986; liebson et al., 1987; noble,
1982). little is known about the effects of the drug on
cardiac output and performance. phenylephrine is an
a-adrenoceptor agonist with no effects on 1-adrenoceptors. in theory it should have differing effects on the

over-the-counter oral proprietary cold remedies often
contain sympathomimetic agents which are included to
act as nasal decongestants. two commonly used drugs
are  xxxd2921xxx  and phenylephrine.  xxxd2921xxx  has both ox- and 3-adrenoceptor agonist
activity but there is confusion in the literature about its
cardiovascular effects and safety: in many studies an
increase in blood pressure has been associated with the

heart and circulation but the cardiovascular actions of
oral preparations have not been studied.
in this study the cardiovascular effects of two overthe-counter proprietary cold remedies, one containing
 xxxd2921xxx  and the other phenylephrine, were
evaluated in a group of young healthy volunteers to
compare their cardiovascular effects and to draw some
conclusions on their safety. as the phenylephrinecontaining preparation contained also a small dose of
caffeine, an analgesic preparation containing the same
caffeine dose was used as a 'placebo'.
methods

subjects
sixteen healthy subjects, seven males and nine females
(mean age 21 years, range 20-23 years, mean weight 69
kg, range 47-86 kg, mean height 1.70 m, range 1.561.88 m) volunteered to take part. none had a prior
history of cardiovascular or respiratory disease and all
had a normal pre-study screening which included physical
examination, electrocardiography, routine blood
haematology, biochemistry and urine testing. all gave
informed written consent. the study was approved by
the ethics committee of west lambeth health district.

study design
a masked random-order crossover design was used to
compare the cardiovascular effects of two proprietary
cold treatments with an analgesic preparation which
acted as a placebo. the three treatments used were:
1. mu-cron (ciba consumer pharmaceuticals,
horsham), two tablets (total administered drug doses:
 xxxd2921xxx  50 mg, paracetamol 1 g). the
sympathomimetic used is a racemate, containing equal
quantities of (lr,2s)- and (ls,2r)-norephedrine.
2. boots cold relief tablets (the boots co plc,
nottingham), two tablets (total administered drug doses:
phenylephrine 10 mg, paracetamol 0.8 g,  xxxd228xxx 
100 mg, caffeine 60 mg). the configuration of the
sympathomimetic is (r)-phenylephrine.
3. boots pain relief tablets (the boots co plc,
nottingham), two tablets (total administered drug doses:
paracetamol 1 g, caffeine 60 mg).
each subject was thus involved in three experiments
which took place once weekly at the same time of day.
one hour before drug administration the subjects were
positioned supine with two pillows for head support and
connected to the measuring apparatus. as the tablets
differ in appearance they were administered to the
subjects by a third party without the subject or investigators being able to see them. in this way subject and
observer bias was avoided. cardiovascular measurements
were made 30 min and immediately before drug administration and subsequently at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and
240 min after dosing.

measurements
blood pressure was measured at each time point in
quintuplicate using an automated digital sphygmomano-

meter (dynamap 1846 sx, critikon ltd, ascot). stroke
volume and cardiac output were estimated non-invasively
using a nccom3 (bomed) impedance cardiograph
and an empirical formula described by sramek (thomas
et al., 1990). the method and its validity, accuracy and
reproducibility are described in detail elsewhere (thomas,
1991; thomas et al., 1990). the method has limits
of agreement with thermodilution cardiac output which
are comparable with other noninvasive techniques
(northridge et al., 1990) and is most accurate when
measuring changes in bloodflow within individual subjects
(boldt et al., 1988). ten separate impedance measurements were made at each time point. the pre-ejection
period (pep) and ventricular ejection time (vet) were
derived from simultaneous recordings of the first
derivative impedance cardiograph (dz/dt) and ecg
taken at a paper speed of 100 mm s-1 as previously
described (thomas, 1991). the validity and reproducibility of this method has been confirmed by simultaneous
comparison with values obtained using combined ecg,
phonocardiography and carotid artery pressure waveform
recordings (thomas & smith, 1990). forearm bloodflow
(left arm) was measured using a conventional strain
gauge plethysmography technique taking quintriplicate
measurements at each time point. data collected from
the first eight subjects were of very poor quality because
of a damaged strain gauge and were therefore discarded.
the strain gauge was replaced in time to study the final
eight subjects (four males and four females) from whom
successful results were obtained.

calculations
stroke index (si) and cardiac index (ci) were obtained
by dividing the impedance-derived stroke volume and
cardiac output values by the body surface area (bsa).
mean blood pressure (mbp) was obtained from the
systolic (sbp) and diastolic blood pressures (dbp) by
adding one third of the pulse pressure (sbp-dbp) to the
dbp. total peripheral resistance index (tpr) was
calculated as (mbp x 80)/cl. this value is contributed
to both by arterial resistance and central venous pressure.
the ratio pep/vet was used as an indicator of cardiac
performance. forearm bloodflow (fbf) was calculated
from the gradient of the recording of strain gauge
resistance and time (g, cm min- 1), the calibration factor
for a 0.1% forearm volume change (c, cm) and the
estimated forearm volume (v, ml) as
fbf (ml min-) = g x v x 0.001
c
forearm vascular resistance (mm hg ml-' min) was
calculated as mbf/fbf.

statistical analysis
the immediate and between occasions repeatability of
each measurement was calculated from results obtained
immediately before administration of the three study
treatments using a two way (subjects and treatments)
repeated measures analysis of variance. within and
between occasions coefficients of variation were calculated by dividing the square root of the appropriate

cardiovascular effects of cold remedies

mean square value by the overall mean value for the
three experiments. the haemodynamic effects of each
treatment were analysed using a two way repeated
measures analysis of variance (anova) comparing
measurements made at each time point with those taken
immediately prior to drug administration ('time 0'). in
addition the changes induced by each of the three drug
treatments (post drug value - time 0 value) were compared
at each time point using a repeated measures anova
and employing duncan's multiple range tests. this type
of analysis was chosen because the impedance method
is most accurate for measuring changes within individual
subjects rather than absolute values for stroke volume
and cardiac output. a similar analysis of variance method
was also used to compare areas under the pharmacodynamic effect-time curves between 0 and 4 h
(auc(0,4 h)).

results

no statistically significant changes were observed in any
of the cardiovascular measurements in the 0.5 h prior to
drug administration indicating that a reasonable baseline
had been achieved (figures 1, 2 and 3). mean absolute
haemodynamic measurements taken prior to the administration of each of the three study treatments did not
differ significantly (table 1). the immediate and between
occasions coefficients of variation of these measurements
are shown in table 1.
boots pain relief tablets, containing caffeine 60 mg
were associated with small reductions in tpr (figure 2)
and fvr and increases in fbf (figure 3) at isolated
time points between 120 and 240 min. however, only
fbf yielded an auc(0,4 h) value which was significantly
changed from zero (table 2). because this treatment
had no important cardiovascular effects it was used as
a 'placebo' for comparison with the two treatments
containing sympathomimetic amines.
the phenylephrine-containing boots cold relief
tablets caused few cardiovascular changes. a small
increase in tpr was detected which was maximal 30
to 60 min after drug administration (figure 2) and
was associated with a small but significant increase in
auc(0,4 h) compared with the 'placebo' pain relief
preparation (table 2). although a small reduction in
fbf and increase in fvr was detected after 240 min

cardiovascular effects of cold remedies
the  xxxd2921xxx -containing mu-cron
preparation caused substantial cardiovascular changes.
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were increased
over baseline with the maximum change of 18/8 mm hg
(systolic/diastolic) observed after 3 h (figure 1). in one
subject blood pressure rose from 106/69 to 168/96 after
this treatment. systolic bp increased by more than 20
mm hg in seven subjects and diastolic bp rose by at least
10 mm hg in eight subjects. this rise in blood pressure
was confirmed by significant increases in auc(0,4 h) for
both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in comparison
to the 'placebo' limb (table 2). associated with the
increase in blood pressure were significant increases in
stroke volume, tpr (figure 2) and fvr (figure 3) and
reductions in pep/vet and fbf (figure 3). for all of
these measurements the auc(0,4 h) was significantly
different from that associated with the 'placebo' boots
pain relief tablets (table 2). mu-cron had no significant
effect on heart rate.
no important side effects were experienced during the
study.

discussion

 xxxd2921xxx  and phenylephrine are included
in a wide range of oral cold remedies and diet aids
available over-the-counter in europe and north america.
the rationale for their inclusion in cold remedies is that
their a-adrenoceptor agonist properties cause nasal
vasoconstriction resulting in shrinkage of the mucosa
and nasal decongestion. there is clear evidence that
topical application of sympathomimetics has this effect
(bende et al., 1984), but the evidence for their value
when administered by mouth is less clear cut. several
studies have shown beneficial effects of  xxxd2921xxx  or ephedrine on symptoms or nasal air flow, given
alone or in combination with antihistamines in patients
with rhinitis (aschan et al., 1974; mclauren et al., 1961;
pullen & montgomery, 1963), although none of these
studies is ideal. oral pseudoephedrine has been shown
to increase nasal air flow in histamine-treated normals
(empey et al., 1980) and in patients with perennial
rhinitis (britton et al., 1978). we have been able to find
no evidence of a beneficial effect of oral phenylephrine;
in one study it was no more effective than placebo
(mclauren et al., 1961).
this research was performed to characterise the effects
of  xxxd2921xxx  and phenylephrine-containing
proprietary cold remedies. rather than use pure preparations of the drugs, two commonly used over-the-counter
preparations were selected. the doses used were chosen
to reflect the maximum recommended doses of the two
sympathomimetics over a range of properietary cold
remedies available in the united kingdom. it should be
pointed out that to give  xxxd2921xxx  50 mg
required the administration of twice the dose of mu-cron
recommended by the manufacturers. as well as
containing the sympathomimetics, the cold remedies
also contained paracetamol,  xxxd228xxx , or caffeine.
as significant effects of caffeine on blood pressure and
catecholamine secretion are well documented (curalto
& robertson, 1983) a 'placebo' preparation containing

709

the same dose of caffeine was chosen. subjects were
studied in the supine position for 4 h after drug administration. previous evidence suggests that peak drug
concentrations or effects are seen within this period for
 xxxd2921xxx  (lake et al., 1988; pentel et al.,
1985), phenylephrine (hengstmann & goronzy, 1982)
and caffeine (curalto & robertson, 1983), although the
effects of  xxxd2921xxx  were expected to persist
beyond 4 h (lake et al., 1988; pentel et al., 1985).
the 'placebo' boots pain relief tablets had no significant or consistent cardiovascular effect, except for small
changes in tpr and forearm bloodflow probably related
to prolonged supine rest. this suggests that the low dose
of caffeine involved was of no cardiovascular importance
and was a reasonable 'placebo' preparation to use.
an interaction with pheylephrine to produce a more than
additive action cannot be excluded by the current study
design, but this appears unlikely as the only important
cardiovascular effect of the phenylephrine and caffeinecontaining boots cold relief tablets was a small and
short-lived increase in tpr. as intravenous phenylephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor in man (boakes et al.,
1973) and over 10 times more potent than intravenous
 xxxd2921xxx  for increasing blood pressure in
animals (trendelenberg et al., 1962) the most likely
explanation for this lack of effect is poor oral bioavailability due to metabolism by gut  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx .
(mao). bioavailability is probably less than the value
of 20-38% previously reported (hengstmann & goronzy,
1982). in view of the small and brief effects of phenylephrine on peripheral resistance it is hard to believe that
this dose can have a therapeutic effect on the nasal
vasculature even though these vessels may be particularly
sensitive to its actions (aviado et al., 1959). in one
clinical trial phenylephrine was no more effective than
placebo in reducing nasal symptoms or elevating blood
pressure (mclauren et al., 1963). as the oral preparation
is both much better absorbed and has dangerous effects
in patients receiving  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors, it is
recommended that the use of phenylephrine in oral cold
remedies should be discontinued.
in comparison to the phenylephrine-containing preparation, the  xxxd2921xxx -based mu-cron tablets
had more marked effects. the increases in blood pressure
and peripheral resistance associated with improvements
in indicators of ventricular performance including pep/
vet and stroke volume are consistent with the ot and
p1-adrenoceptor agonist action of  xxxd2921xxx .
the absence of a reflex bradycardia also suggests a i,
effect. the effects of the drug on stroke volume and
cardiac function have previously been described in only
four subjects using echocardiography; similarly, improvements in indicators of left ventricular performance
including fractional shortening, stroke volume and
ejection fraction were found and these were prevented
by propranolol (pentel et al., 1985).
there is some confusion in the literature about the
effects of  xxxd2921xxx  on blood pressure with
some authors reporting increases (horowitz et al., 1980;
lake et al., 1988a; pentel et al., 1985), while others have
failed to demonstrate more than a trivial effect (blackburn
et al., 1989; goodman et al., 1986; liebson et al., 1987;
nobel, 1982). such differences are partly dose determined but they may also relate to the formulation of the

710

s. h. l. thomas et al.

drug, as slow-release preparations may not increase bp
to the same extent as do conventional products (cuthbert
et al., 1969). the phenylpropranolamine enantiomer
used is also important. experiments in rats have shown
that (lr,2s)-norephedrine is more potent than (1s-2r)norephedrine or the racemic mixture (moya-huff et al.,
1987). the former was probably the active agent in the
'trimulets' preparation which was associated with large
increases in blood pressure (horowitz et al., 1980).
racemic pseudonorephedrine [configuration (1s-2s)
plus (1r,2r)] may also be a constituent of some anorectic
preparations and is less potent still (moya-huff et al.,
1987). in the united kingdom  xxxd2921xxx ,
as described in the british pharmacopoeia, consists
largely of racemic norephedrine and contains less than
1% pseudonorephedrine.
it is clear from the results of the current study that
 xxxd2921xxx  given as racemic norephedrine at
a recommended dose to young healthy volunteers causes
significant increases in blood pressure and in some
individuals these increases can be surprisingly large.
although serious adverse effects have been reported in
such subjects (lake et al., 1990; pentel et al., 1984) they
appear to be very rare, considering the frequency of use
of this agent. in view of the positive, albeit weak,
therapeutic evidence in favour of the drug its short-term
use as a symptomatic therapy for rhinitis does not appear
unreasonable in otherwise healthy individuals. because

it increases blood pressure  xxxd2921xxx  preparations should be avoided by patients with hypertension.
the cardiovascular changes induced by the drug are also
likely to increase myocardial oxygen demand. as this
may worsen  xxxd1914xxx  symptoms the drug should be avoided
in patients with ischaemic heart disease.  xxxd2921xxx  preparations should also be avoided by those
receiving drugs likely to interact. these include mao
inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic
antidepressants and methyldopa (cuthbert et al., 1969;
lake et al., 1990; mclaren, 1976). at the very least
these contraindications should be stated clearly and
specifically on the packaging, which should also have
unequivocal warnings about the risks of exceeding the
recommended dose. however, in view of these factors,
the toxicity of the drug in overdose (lake et al., 1990;
pentel, 1984) and its real or perceived abuse potential
(blum, 1981), there is a strong case for recategorising
 xxxd2921xxx  as a prescription only medicine.
half of the experiments were performed by j. balakrishnan,
t. campbell-smith, m. grover, n. j. mcdonald, r. a.
mehta, p-n. mohanna, a. murray and f. m. vaz as part of
their intercalated b.sc. in pharmacological sciences. while
there are too many of these students for each to be included
as an author, their valuable contribution to the research is

acknowledged.
