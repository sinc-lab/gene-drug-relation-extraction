(received 12 july 1993; accepted 22 september 1993)

two distinct/3-tubulin c d n a isotypes (/38 9 and ¢/12--16) from haemonchus contortus were expressed for the first time in
escherichia coli and characterised by their specific mebendazole (mbz) binding and polymerization properties.  xxxg2353xxx 
was expressed without translational fusion to an e. coli sequence under the regulation of the tryptophan promoter in the
ptrp2 vector.  xxxg2353xxx  was produced in large amounts in insoluble 'inclusion bodies'. the inclusion bodies were purified
and solubilised and the/~-tubulin renatured by treatment with urea followed by dilution with alkaline buffer and a shift to
physiological ph. the yield was more than 10 mg of/%tubulin per litre of cell culture. the recombinant tubulin produced was
recognized in western blot by specific anti-/3-tubulin antibodies. tritiated mbz binding to the recombinant h. contortus/3tubulin was measured in the presence or absence of whole, tubulin-free or tubulin-rich extracts of h. contortus. some
[3h]mbz high-affinity binding (hb) to 'pure' (no other eukaryotic protein present)/38-9 or/312 16 was observed. enhanced
high-affinity binding was observed when recombinant/38 9 or/312 16 were mixed and pre-incubated with whole supernatants
or tubulin-enriched extracts from h. contortus. the enhancement was more than additive. /312 16 bound more mbz and
caused a greater enhancement than/~8 9. mixing recombinant/38 9 or/312 16 with whole supernatants or tubulin-enriched
fractions from h. contortus promoted polymerization at 37°c. use of 35s-labelled protein showed that the polymer contained
recombinant tubulin. western blot using specific anti-e-tubulin monoclonal antibodies showed that the polymer contained etubulin. similarly the recombinant nematode /3-tubulin co-polymerized with tubulin from chicken brain. our data suggest
that the recombinant/3-tubulin can interact and copolymerize with parasite or chicken tubulin. furthermore the interaction of
recombinant nematode /3-tubulin with native tubulin and/or microtubule associated proteins (maps) resulted in the
formation of high-affinity mbz-binding sites. however, interaction of recombinant/3-tubulin with microtubule proteins from
chicken brain did not result in the formation of high-affinity mbz-binding sites.

mebendazole (mbz) is one of many
benzimidazole (bz) drugs widely used as
anthelmintics. anthelmintic treatment has
been the most effective line of control of
parasitic nematodes but parasite nematodes
have shown great potential to develop resistance to virtually all anthelmintics in use today
[1-3]. bz-resistance is now wide-spread in
parasitic nematodes of animals, with haemonchus contortus in sheep and goats being

282

most affected [3]. the mechanism by which
anthelmintics kill parasites has largely remained unknown and consequently the mechanism of anthelmintic resistance is also
largely unknown.
it is thought bzs exert their anthelmintic
effects by binding to tubulin and causing
depolymerization of microtubules [review
1,4,5]. a dynamic equilibrium of microtubule
formation and dissipation, and of the association of free ~- and j%tubulin into the dimeric
form, is required for cell division and viability
[6,7]. most eukaryotic cells express multiple,
closely related ~- and /~-tubulin isotypes [8,9].
circumstantial evidence suggests that bzs bind
/3-tubulin [see 1,5,10 for review]. in fungi,
mutations conferring bz-resistance map to the
/3-tubulin locus [10 16]. four different amino
acid alterations [10,16] have been reported to
confer resistance among different mutants of
aspergillus nidulans. it can not be said if more
alterations conferring resistance in fungi will
be described. in addition, resistance appeared
to be bz-structure dependent. two mutations
of /3-tubulin that conferred resistance to
 xxxd3345xxx  conferred supersensitivity to
benomyl and carbendazin [10]. similarly, in
neurospora an amino acid substitution in [3tubulin conferred carbendazin resistance and
diethofencarb sensitivity [11]. these studies
suggest that drugs aimed at overcoming
resistance can be designed. in caenorhabditis
elegans resistance was associated with deletion
of a /3-tubulin gene [17]. recent studies at the
protein level [18] or dna level [19-21] suggest
that alterations in /3-tubulin may be the cause
of bz-resistance in h. contortus but the role of
individual /3-tubulin isoforms is not known.
restriction fragment length polymorphism [21]
or pcr [22] analyses on individual h.
contortus worms showed a simultaneous reduction in diversity associated with two /3tubulin isotypes (/38-9 and/312 16), but not in
~-tubulin, in the resistant strain. no exact
sequence associated with bz binding or
resistance in parasitic nematodes has been
described. whereas the isolation and cloning
of resistant mutants in fungi has been relatively
easy, this has not been possible in helminth

parasites.
sufficient amounts of relatively pure tubulin
that can be used in binding and other studies
can readily be obtained from vertebrate
sources [6,7]. recently banerjee and luduena
[23] have described the colchicine binding of
bovine-brain tubulin pools isotypically pure
with respect to /3-tubulin. complete purification of h. contortus tubulin has been hampered
by the low concentration of tubulin in worm
tissues. consequently, pure h. contortus
tubulin has not been used in bz-binding
studies. most studies use total soluble-protein
(supernatants) to compare the bz-tubulin
interaction of susceptible and resistant strains
[2,~28]. at low-labelled drug concentrations,
bzs predominantly bind tubulin-rich fractions
[18]. at higher bz concentrations non-tubulin
proteins can bind substantial bz, but the
tubulin-rich pool accounts for all of the highaffinity binding [18,26]. analyses of bz
binding kinetics suggest that resistance is
accompanied by reduction of the high-affinity
bm~× (maximum binding at infinite labelled-bz
concentration) and not the k~ (association
constant) [27, 28]. high-affinity bmax was not
the same in all developmental stages [27] or
tissues (bughio et al., unpublished) of the same
species, although the average k~, was of similar
order of magnitude for all stages or tissues.
tubulin concentration [27] or tubulin isotype
composition [29] can change from one tissue
or developmental stage to another. higher
tubulin concentrations were obtained from
eggs of h. contortus compared with adult or
larval stages [27]. tubulin rich extracts were
prepared using poly-l-lysine affinity chromatography (plc) and used in bz binding
studies [18]. although eggs contain significantly more tubulin (and significantly more
specific bmax) than adult worms [27], the total
tubulin yield from eggs was still insufficient for
polymerization and other studies.
expressing individual tubulin genes would
circumvent the problems associated with
purification of parasite tubulin. two distinct
/3-tubulin cdnas of h. contortus have now
been cloned and sequenced [5]. we report, for
the first time, the expression and purification

283

of the two recombinant /3-tubulin isoforms
(/38-9 and/312-16) and their use in bz-binding
and polymerization studies.

materials and methods

enzymes. restriction endonucleases and t4
dna ligase were purchased from new
england biolabs. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) kit was purchased from promega.
enzyme reaction conditions were as recommended by the supplier.
plasmid construction, cdnas encoding/38-9
or/312-16 tubulin were expressed individually
without translational fusion to an e. coli
sequence under the control of the ptrp
promoter in the ptrp2 vector as described

[30]. in order to introduce the appropriate
restriction sites with the start and stop codons,
the inserts were regenerated by pcr using/389 or/312-16 cdna as template and 5' and 3'
complementary primers bearing the modifying
sequences at the appropriate end. the pcr
products were cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes, purified via electrophoresis
through an agarose gel and ligated with the
ptrp2 vector which had been similarly digested
and purified (see fig. 1).

selection of positive transformants. plasmid
constructs were screened and maintained in e.
coli strain jml01. transformation was carried
out using cells made competent by the cac12
method [31] and transformants selected on lb
medium containing 100 /~g m1-1 ampicillin
(sigma). a single colony from each construct

fig. 1. plasmid construction. full length/~8-9 or/312 16 cdna was regenerated by pcr in order to introduce modifications
at the ends as shown. the cdna and the ptrp2 vector were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, purified and

was selected and examined for expression by
sds-page and western blot and used in all
subsequent studies. the constructs were sequenced to verify that the pcr did not
introduce mutations.

induction of gene expression. the ptrp promoter was induced under tryptophan starvation conditions [30]. a single positive colony
was grown at 37°c to mid-log phase
(a600=0.8-1.0) in 500 ml of lb medium
containing ampicillin (100 /~g ml l) and
tryptophan (sigma) (1 mg m1-1) to repress
promoter activity. to induce expression by
tryptophan starvation, the grown cells were
collected by centrifugation under aseptic
conditions and cultured for a further 1 h at
37°c in 1 1 of m9 minimal medium containing
glucose (6 mg m l - l ) , ampicillin (100/~g ml -~)
and 0.1% acid-hydrolysed casein amino acids
(sigma).
cell lysis and purification of inclusion bodies. the tubulin was produced in insoluble
inclusion bodies. cells were lysed to free the
inclusion bodies intact [31]. the bacterial cell
walls were digested on ice with 2 mg m l lysozyme in lysis buffer containing 50 m m
tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 1 mm edta, 100 mm
 xxxg2020xxx , 0.5 m m phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride
(pmsf), 20 mm  xxxd302xxx  hydrochloride
and 20 #g ml -~ dnase i (sigma). the
resulting spheroblasts were disrupted by addition of 4 mg m l - l  xxxd1835xxx  (sigma). a
fresh aliquot of dnase was added and the
viscous lysate left at room temperature until
the d n a was completely digested. the lysate
was centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 30 rain and
the inclusion bodies recovered in the pellet.
the pellet was washed 3 times by incubation (5
min) in 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5%
triton x-100 and 10 m m edta and centrifugation at 12 0 0 0 x g (30 min). a polytron
was routinely used throughout the procedure
to resuspend the pellet in the appropriate
buffer. the procedures described in this
section and below were carried out at 4°c
except where noted.

solubilization of the inclusion bodies and
renaturation of tubulin. inclusion bodies
were solubilized and renatured utilizing the
urea-alkaline method [32]. the pellet was
dissolved in 3 ml of 8 m urea and incubated for
1 h at room temperature, diluted 20 times with
50 mm kh2po4 (ph 10.7) containing 0.1 m m
pmsf, 1 mm edta and 50 mm  xxxg2020xxx  and
stored for 30 rain at room temperature. the
ph was then adjusted to 8.0 and the incubation
continued for a further 30 min. the sample
was centrifuged at 12 0 0 0 x g for 30 min and
the supernatant concentrated to a third of its
original volume utilising amicon cones
(cf50a) as described by the supplier (amicon, on). the concentrate was then diluted 3
times with mes buffer (ph 6.5) consisting of
0.025 m mes, 1 mm egta, 0.5 mm  xxxd2534xxx 
and 1 mm gtp and re-concentrated to one
third. this was diluted again with mes buffer
and concentrated twice. the sample was
centrifuged (100 000 xg, 1 h) at 4°c to ensure
that there was no aggregated tubulin. protein
concentration was measured by the method of
bradford [33] using purified vertebrate brain
tubulin as standard. pmsf (0.1 mm) was
added and the recombinant tubulin stored in
liquid nitrogen. tubulin was diluted to 0.1 #g
/tl-1 with mes buffer and stored on ice for at
least 30 min before use. for comparison,
samples containing fl8-9 and ill2 16 were
processed simultaneously.
sds-page and western blotting. sdsp a g e and electroblot transfer and immunoblotting were performed as described [18,27].
monoclonal
anti-chicken fl-tubulin igg
(amersham) and polyclonal anti-tubulin antibodies (icn) were used for antigenic verification of the recombinant tubulin.
binding conditions. binding assays using
unlabelled mebendazole (mbz) and [3h]mbz
(janssen pharmaceutical, mississauga, on) to
determine total binding (tb), low-affinity
binding (lb) and high-affinity (specific) binding (hb) were performed at 37°c as described
[28].

285

poly-l-lysine
affinity
chromatography.
supernatants from egg or adult stages of h.
contortus were fractionated into tubulin-rich
and tubulin-free components by poly-imysine
affinity chromatography (plc) as described
[18]. western blotting was used to verify the
presence or absence of tubulin in various
fractions. the tubulin-rich or tubulin-free
fractions were pooled, washed (by diluting
several times with mes buffer to remove salts)
and concentrated and the tubulin content
estimated by sds-page as described [18].

expression by tryptophan starvation, na235so4
(10 #ci ml-z) was added to the pre-warmed
culture medium and incubated with the cells
for 30 min at 37°c with gentle agitation. the
35s-labelled tubulin was recovered as described
above and used in polymerization studies. for
autoradiography, the sds-page gels were
dried and exposed to chemiluminescence films
(hyperfilm, amersham) for 5 h at - 8 0 ° c .

polymerization studies. to determine if the
recombinant tubulin could copolymerize with
native h. contortus tubulin, a polymerization
study based on the vertebrate-tubulin purification method of shelanski et al. [34] was
undertaken. vertebrate brain tubulin which
polymerizes readily, was used as control in this
study. samples were incubated on ice for 30
rain to depolymerize any polymeric tubulin
and then at 37'~c for 30 min to promote
polymerization. the effect of mixing total
supernatants, tubulin-rich or tubulin-free extracts with the recombinant tubulin was
examined. the effects of protein or tubulin
concentration were also examined. in a
standard assay, 1 mg protein of parasite or
chicken brain supernatants or bovine serum
albumin (bsa) were mixed with 200 ~tg of fl8-9
or /~12-16 (total volume=400 /~1) and preincubated on ice for 30 rain and then incubated
at 37°c for a further 30 min. an underlayer of
2 ml 20% (v/v) glycerol was added and the
sample centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h to
recover the tubulin polymer in the pellet. an
aliquot from the supernatant was analyzed by
sds-page. the pellet was carefully rinsed
with warm mes buffer and then suspended in
200/~1 sds-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and
an aliquot (30 #1) analyzed by sds-page and
western blot.

specifically recognized by an anti-/~-tubulin

labelling of the recombinant tubulin with 35s.

the saturation analysis was repeated using
tubulin-enriched extracts from adult worms
with similar results (fig. 5b).

polymerization studies. after ultracentrifugation of samples mixed and incubated as
described in materials and methods, the
pellets and supernatants were analyzed by
sds-page. on the gels of the pellets,
coomassie blue staining of sds-page gels
revealed a major band corresponding to
tubulin when recombinant fl8-9 or fl12-16
was incubated with parasite or chicken-brain
supernatants, but not when incubated with
bsa (fig. 6a). the major band was absent
when small amounts of recombinant//-tubulin
were used but increasing the amount of
recombinant //-tubulin added to a fixed
amount of native protein increased its abundance (not shown). to show that the pellet
contained recombinant tubulin the latter was
labelled with 35s and polymerization followed
by autoradiography of sds-page gels. an
abundant band corresponding to tubulin was
seen when recombinant //8-9 or //12-16 was
incubated with parasite or chicken-brain
extracts, but not when the recombinant
tubulins were incubated with bsa (fig. 6b).
there was no obvious difference in polymerization between //8-9 and //12-16. taxol was
tested to see if it would induce polymerization
of pure or mixed recombinant //-tubulins; no
increase in the level of polymerization was
apparent (fig. 6c). fig. 7 shows that induction
of polymerization depended on the amount of
total (fig. 7a) or tubulin-enriched (fig. 7b)
extract added. protein extracts lacking tubulin
failed to induce polymerization. western blot
using anti-e-tubulin antibodies indicated that
the pellet contained a-tubulin (fig. 7b).
on the gels of the supernatants corresponding to the pellets described above, the tubulin
band was still abundant in samples incubated
with tubulin-free extracts or bsa but was
diminished in samples incubated with total or
tubulin-rich parasite or chicken brain extracts
(not shown).

discussion

this is the first report of the expression and
purification of nematode recombinant tubulin.
comprehensive study of nematode tubulin
biochemistry has been hampered by the
scarcity of tubulin in the tissues of these
organisms. there has been no method for
isolation of specific tubulin types and isotypes
for use in binding and polymerization studies.
the exact amino acid sequence of the expressed tubulin is known [5] so that in the long
term it will be possible to determine the protein
sequences influencing the physiological activities of tubulin. information derived from
studying bz-protein and protein-protein interactions using specifically known tubulin isoforms should help answer fundamental
questions yet unanswered: which tubulin
isoforms or sequences form the binding site?
what is the molecular basis of bz-sensitivity
and what are the molecular alterations that
lead to bz-resistance? it is still not clear
whether the bz-binding site is a primary,
secondary or a more complex three-dimensional pocket involving one or more tubulin
types/isotypes and other proteins such as
maps. the data presented in this paper show
that tubulin expressed in e. coli can be used in
polymerization and bz-binding studies.
when recombinant tubulin was used alone
some [3h]mbz binding that could be inhibited
(apparent hb) by 10 #m unlabelled mbz was
observed (fig. 3). however, the affinity of
mbz for recombinant fi-tubulin was less than
that for native parasite tubulin. it was
estimated that the amount of mbz bound
(moles mg-~ tubulin) by the recombinant fltubulin was 10 times less than that bound by
the native parasite tubulin. it can not be said
why the level of mbz binding was small
compared with that expected if native parasite
tubulin was used at equivalent concentrations.
some or all of the recombinant tubulin may
not be properly folded to form a complete
mbz-binding site. complete folding may
require post-translational modification or
association with e-tubulin or maps. when
parasite supernatants were added to fl8-9 or

290

fl12-16 an enhanced high-affinity binding was
observed. although the apparent association
constant (ka) of the parasite extracts was not
altered, the enhanced binding due to fl8-9 or
fl12-16 was more than additive. the receptors
involved in the enhancement, whatever their
origin, had a k~ similar to that of native
tubulin. when fl8-9 or fl12-16 was mixed with
chicken brain supernatants enhanced binding
was not observed. the data suggest that, in
presence of recombinant fl-tubulin, a bz
binding site in parasite extracts became more
available or a factor in parasite extracts made
recombinant fl-tubulin a better bz-receptor.
this effect was associated with tubulin-rich
fractions only (fig. 4). this suggests that the
effector was some form of tubulin or maps.
the enhancement can be explained by the
property of tubulin subunits to associate and
dissociate in a dynamic equilibrium controlled
by a variety of conditions including the
concentration of individual e and fl subunits,
dimers, oligomers and polymers [6,7]. the
association of well folded recombinant fltubulin with ~-tubulin or maps may result in
the formation of a complete high-affinity site
similar to that of native tubulin. alternatively
the recombinant fl-tubulin may just replace
drug-active fl-tubulin native molecules locked
up by association/polymerization with other
microtubule proteins. the displaced native fltubulin molecules may then become available
for drug binding.
at saturation, the enhancement due to/312
16 was greater than that due to /38-9. this
means that the addition of recombinant fl1216 resulted in more high-affinity bz-receptors
(bmax) than the addition of /38-9. why this
should be is at present unclear. it can be
assummed that the experimental conditions
allowed both isoforms to refold to the same
extent. banerjee and luduena [23] have
compared the colchicine-binding kinetics of
bovine-tubulin pools isotypically pure with
respect to fl-tubulin. tubulin pools containing
/311, /31n and fllv tubulin had distinct colchicinebinding rates, with the fllv pool having the
strongest affinity. single pools bound colchicine monophasically while the mixture of pools

bound biphasically. however, all pools contained ~-tubulin and possibly maps. bovine
brain tubulin binds colchicine biphasically
whereas bovine kidney tubulin binds monophasically apparently because the latter lacks
the tim tubulin isotype in its tubulin pool [35].
the fact that the tubulin isotypes differ in their
interactions with colchicine raises the possibility that isotypes might also differ in their
interaction with ~-tubulin or different nontubulin proteins, which in turn, may regulate
the various drug-binding sites and other
properties associated with microtubules.
when an increasing amount of [3h]mbz
was added to a fixed amount of recombinant
tubulin mixed with a fixed amount of parasite
supernatants (fig. 5a) or tubulin enriched
extracts (fig. 5b) saturation of the enhanced
binding was observed. the specific receptors
formed were saturated. tubulin concentration
influences the level of mbz binding probably
by shifting the polymerization-depolymerization equilibrium [prichard and tanga, unpulished]. when tubulin in parasite supernatants
is enriched by poly-lysine affinity chromatography (plc), the increase in the amount of
binding is not directly proportional to the
increase in tubulin concentration (lubega et
al., unpublished). when fl8-9 or fl12-16 were
mixed with total soluble protein or tubulinenriched extracts of h. contortus polymerization could occur at 37°c. bsa or parasite
proteins devoid of tubulin did not promote
polymerization of single or mixed recombinant
fl-tubulin even when taxol was added. taxol
promotes native nematode-tubulin polymerization [18]. recombinant tubulin copolymerized
with parasite or vertebrate tubulin. the data
suggest that recombinant fl-tubulin may have
been able to aggregate and copolymerize with
native e-tubulin. the interaction of recombinant fl-tubulin with native tubulin or maps of
h. contortus resulted in the formation of new
high-affinity bz-binding sites. the availability
of recombinant tubulins will assist with the
determination of the structure of the bzreceptor and other sites in nematode tubulin.
future studies should include the use of purified
or expressed e-tubulin and possibly maps.
