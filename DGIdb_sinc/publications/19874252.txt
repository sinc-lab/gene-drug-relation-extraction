 xxxd3314xxx  (trb) is an allylamine antifungal agent that has been available
for more than a decade. it is now used for the treatment of dermatophytic
infections and onychomycosis. despite several studies having demonstrated
the efficacy of  xxxd3314xxx  against nondermatophytic infections including
azole-resistant candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, disseminated fusariosis and
scedosporiosis, the role of trb in the management of these infections remains
greatly underappreciated. a brief review of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro and in vivo data and published case reports provides insight
into the use of  xxxd3314xxx  as a potential adjunct in combination with azoles,
polyenes or echinocandins in the management of severe drug-resistant or
refractory mycoses. despite the lack of intrinsic fungicidal activity against
several nondermatophytes, when used in combination, particularly with
azoles, trb has demonstrated good antifungal efficacy that could be
exploited in clinical practice. as comprehensive human clinical studies are
not feasible with the rare occurence of these mycoses, experiments using
animal models are essential to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of drug combinations. in summary,  xxxd3314xxx  has established itself as a drug of choice for
dermatophytic infections; it must be considered in combination with other
antifungal agents for the management of nondermatophytic refractory or
resistant yeast/mold infections as well.

introduction

 xxxd3314xxx  (trb; box 1) is an antifungal drug that belongs to the allylamine group
of agents and was first approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the uk
and the usa in the 1990s. several randomized, controlled trials have established
its efficacy and safety and it has been reported to be superior to  xxxd2235xxx ,
itraconazole (itz) and fluconazole (flz) in the treatment of dermatophytoses and
toenail onychomycosis [1,2]. it shows excellent in vitro activity against a variety of
dermatophytes including trichophyton rubrum, trichophyton mentagrophytes and
epidermophyton floccosum, ringworm infections including tinea pedis, tinea cruris,
tinea corporis and tinea unguinum [3,4]. it has replaced  xxxd2235xxx  for the management of most dermatomycoses and ringworm infections [5,6]. since its introduction in the 1990s, several studies have demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo
efficacy of trb against various emerging nondermatophytic fungal infections
including yeast (candida and cryptococcus spp.), dematiacious and filamentous
molds including azole-resistant isolates [7,8]. despite excellent in vitro activity,
the therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd3314xxx  in the management of these pathogens is
unclear at present. the current use of  xxxd3314xxx  in clinical practice excluding
dermatophytic infections and onychomycosis is limited to refractory or resistant
yeast and mold infections and is based on anecdotal data or published case reports;

laboratory testing of  xxxd3314xxx  against nondermatophytes has
not been standardized; there are no recommendations pertaining to the appropriate use of trb for nondermatophytic
infections. unlike other reviews on trb published so far, this
article is a compilation of vital data on the pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics, in vitro and in vivo efficacy, adverse
reactions, drug interactions, drug resistance of trb, including
literature published pertinent to the use of trb not only for
the treatment of dermatophytic and ringworm infections for
which it is approved for, but for resistant, refractory nondermatophytic fungal infections as well.

dual mechanism of action: i) inhibition of se resulting in
decreased erg synthesis, an essential component of the fungal
cell membrane; and ii) accumulation of intracellular squalene
concentration to toxic levels that interferes with cell membrane function and cell wall synthesis, ultimately contributing
to cell death.  xxxd3314xxx  inhibits the enzymatic activity of
fungal se at a very low concentration (noncompetitive inhibition) than that required to inhibit the mammalian counterpart (4000-fold higher concentration needed; competitive
inhibition). some of these earlier studies demonstrated that
trb had no effect on mammalian cholesterol synthesis
in vivo, thereby establishing its safety profile [10].

pharmacology and mechanism of action
3.

 xxxd3314xxx  is an allylamine that is structurally related to its
analog naftifine (figure 1). it exerts its antifungal activity via
noncompetitive inhibition of  xxxg2197xxx  (se), an
enzyme that acts on its substrate squalene, an early intermediate in the fungal ergosterol (erg) biosynthesis pathway. it
has been shown to be the most potent inhibitor of squalene
epoxidase, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of
15.8 nm, compared with naftifine (ic50, 114.6 nm), thiocarbamates (ic50, 28.0 nm) and tolnaftate (ic50, 51.5 nm), other
known  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors. a structure–activity
relationship study with some analogs of  xxxd3314xxx  has indicated that the tertiary amino structure with the tert-alkyl side
chain is crucial for its high potency [9]. measurement of
erg and other intermediates in the erg pathway by incorporation of radiolabelled precursors revealed a correlation
between erg inhibition and accumulation of squalene in a
wide range of pathogenic fungi. from these observations, it is
clear that the fungicidal activity of  xxxd3314xxx  is a result of a
2724

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

the use of  xxxd3314xxx  primarily for treatment of fungal infections of the nail and skin is ascribed to its unique pharmacokinetics. following oral administration, it is readily
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, is not affected by
the presence of food and has a bioavailability of 70 – 80%.
it rapidly diffuses from the vascular system, passes through
the dermis and epidermis, and concentrates in the lipophilic
stratum corneum. because of its lipophilicity, it gets distributed via sebum and reaches high concentrations in hair
follicles, hair, sebum-rich skin, nail plate and adipose tissue
within the first few weeks of therapy [11]. after 12 days of treatment, concentrations in the stratum corneum exceed those in
plasma by a factor of 75 and concentrations in the epidermis
and dermis exceed those in plasma by a factor of 25. blood
cells contain approximately 8% of administered  xxxd3314xxx .
most of the drug in plasma is protein-bound (> 99%), being
evenly distributed among all plasma fractions.  xxxd3314xxx

observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the reason for
trb not being indicated for first-line or primary therapy for
life-threatening, rapidly progressive fungal/mold infections,
despite good in vitro fungicidal activity, is its failure to achieve
and maintain high therapeutic plasma concentrations in a
reasonable period of time despite good concentrations in the
peripheral tissues.

undergoes first-pass metabolism and is extensively metabolized in the liver by n-demethylation of the central nitrogen
atom, oxidation of the alkyl side-chain and arene oxide formation followed by hydrolysis to the corresponding dihydrodiol. metabolism involves only a small fraction (< 5%) of total
hepatic cytochrome p450 capacity. fifteen metabolites have
been identified, but none has antifungal activity [12]. with a
dosage of 250 mg administered orally once daily, serum concentration ranges from 0.8 to 1.5 mg/l (2.4 – 4.6 µmol/liter)
and concentration in nails, ~ 250 – 550 ng/mg. it is detected
in toenails 3 – 18 weeks postinitiation of therapy, with no
progressive increase thereafter during a 48-week course of
therapy [13,14]. approximately 80% of an administered dose is
excreted in the urine as metabolites and 20% is eliminated in
feces. in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance
£ 50 ml/min) or hepatic cirrhosis, the clearance of  xxxd3314xxx 
is decreased by approximately 50% compared with normal
volunteers. the disposition parameters of  xxxd3314xxx  are
dose-independent with the exception of time to maximum
concentration (tmax) and the half-life of the drug (t1/2a).
however the cmax (peak serum concentration) and the area
under the curve (auc) are dose-dependent [15]. at a dose
of 250 mg orally once daily for 28 days, administered to
human male volunteers, peak concentration was seen in sebum
(56 µg/g) after 14 days of therapy. the concentration was
1.0 µg/g 44 days after discontinuation of medication. in stratum corneum, a peak concentration of 14.4 µg/g was noted
24 h after the last day of therapy. the concentrations in
hair and nails 1 day after stopping therapy were lower at
2.36 µg/g and 0.39 µg/g respectively. however, concentrations were still 0.21 µg/g in hair and 0.09 µg/g in nails 55 days
after stopping therapy. importantly, tissue levels of trb
during and after discontinuation of therapy were consistently
above the plasma concentration except in the nails [16,17].
finlay et al. specifically looked at the concentration of trb in
nails in 12 patients who received trb orally at 250 mg/day
for up to 48 weeks. authors reported that the time to detection of drug in distal nail clippings was 3 – 18 weeks after
initiation of therapy and the levels (0.25 – 0.55 ng/mg)
remained stable through the study period [18]. a terminal
half-life of 200 – 400 h may represent the slow elimination of
trb from tissues such as skin and adipose. based on these

drug dosage and administration

 xxxd3314xxx  is available for oral (onychomycosis) and topical
(tinea infections) administration. oral dosage is one 250-mg
tablet, once daily for 6 weeks for fingernail onychomycosis
and 12 weeks for toenail onychomycosis [19]. pulse therapy
using trb alone or in combination with itz has been
evaluated with good results [20,21]. a prospective nonrandomized open study involving 59 patients conducted by
zaias et al. concluded that 7 days of trb therapy given
once every 1 – 3 months was associated with a good cure
rate of 93% for toenail onychomycosis [22].  xxxd3314xxx  is
available in different formulations (topical cream, jelly, spray
or solution for treatment of cutaneous fungal infections
including dermatophytic and candida infections; tablet formulations are indicated for the treatment of fingernail or
toenail onychomycoses). in general toenail onychomycoses
require longer duration of treatment (12 weeks). the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy are greatly influenced
by the type of formulation and dosage used. overall, the
optimal clinical effect is frequently observed a few months
after mycological cure and cessation of treatment. this is
related to the period required for outgrowth of healthy nail.
although not approved, trb is being used as salvage therapy
for various refractory nondermatophytic invasive mycoses at
higher dosages than recommended for dermatophyts or onychomycoses. most experts advocate higher doses ranging from
500 to 1000 mg/day for 3 – 12 months based on the specific
pathogen and clinical situation.

adverse reactions and postmarketing
surveillance

5.

 xxxd3314xxx  has demonstrated a good toxicity profile at the
recommended dosage. most frequently reported effects
include headache, nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain and
diarrhea; reports of vision and taste disturbances can occur
with long-term therapy. liver function abnormalities are
relatively rare, unlike azoles. a spectrum of new cutaneous
adverse effects has been reported and includes erythema multiforme, erythroderma, urticaria, pityriasis rosea or worsening
of pre-existing psoriasis. a large postmarketing surveillance of
25,000 patients on trb reported the frequency of cutaneous reactions to be ~ 2.5% [23]. de novo or drug-induced
lupus erythematosus has been reported by several authors.
 xxxd3314xxx  therefore must be used with extreme caution in
patients with lupus, especially those who are anti-nuclear

acute fulminant hepatic failure have also been reported in the
literature [24-28].
6.

drug interactions

as hepatic metabolism involves less than 5% of cytochrome
p-450 system, trb has minimal drug interactions, compared
with azoles [29]. however, caution should be exercised when
coprescribing trb and drugs metabolized by cyp2d6,
particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index: tricyclic
antidepressants (desipramine,  xxxd156xxx  and nortryptiline),
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, class 1c
antiarrhythmics (e.g.,  xxxd2113xxx  and propafenone) and type b
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and requires a reduction in dose
of the 2d6-metabolized drug [30,31]. despite reports of altered
prothrombin time in patients concomitantly taking oral trb
and warfarin, a causal relationship has not been clearly established [32].  xxxd3314xxx  clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a cyp450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by
cimetidine, a cyp450 enzyme inhibitor.  xxxd3314xxx  increases
the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%, but its clearance is
unaffected by cyclosporine [33].
7.

activity of  xxxd3314xxx  in vitro

 xxxd3314xxx  has consistently demonstrated excellent activity against dermatophytes in vitro (clsi m38-a2). the
mic range of trb against dermatophytes is depicted in
table 1 [34,35]. in addition, trb has demonstrated good
in vitro activity against candida (including azole-resistant
candida spp.) [36], aspergillus spp., fusarium spp. [37], sporotrichosis [38], chromoblastomycosis [39,40], paecilomyces
spp., [41], pythium spp., scedosporium spp., zygomycetes,
cryptococcus spp., penicillium marneffei [42] and pneumocystis
carinii (jirovecii) (table 2) [43]. although trb has been used
as salvage therapy for various refractory mycoses, mic testing
2726

has not been standardized for these isolates. jessup et al.,
examined the susceptibility of 100 yeast strains (10 species
including candida albicans, non-c. albicans, flz-susceptible
and -resistant candida spp.) and 184 strains of filamentous
fungi and dermatophytes (29 species including aspergillus spp.,
fusarium spp., sporothrix spp., t. rubrum, t. mentagrophytes,
trichophyton tonsurans, microsporum canis and e. floccosum),
using the nccls m27-a microdilution methodology for
yeasts and a modified m38-p methodology for molds and
demonstrated good susceptibility pattern for most isolates [44].
in another study, the mic range of trb against most
candida spp. was 0.03 – 1 µg/ml with the lowest mic
for c. parapsilosis (0.03 µg/ml) and highest for c. krusei and
c. tropicalis (128 µg/ml) [45]. other fungi including aspergillus
spp., fusarium spp., scedosporium spp., rhizopus spp.,
scopulariopsis spp. and sporothrix schenkii had an mic range
of 0.06 – 8 µg/ml; geometric mean of 0.06 – 1, which was
below the therapeutic plasma concentrations achieved by
trb. fungi with high mics included aspergillus flavus,
scedosporium prolificans and rhizopus spp. (table 2). dannaoui
et al. demonstrated a wide range of susceptibility pattern
including differential susceptibilities of various zygomycetes
(0.03 – >32 µg/ml) to trb. absidia spp. were more susceptible to trb than rhizopus spp. or mucor spp. among
rhizopus spp., rhizopus microsporus was more susceptible
than rhizopus oryzae (0.15 and 64 µg/ml respectively)
with antifungal activity dependent on the incubation time
as well [46].
as rare and resistant fungal pathogens continue to emerge
in immunocompromised patients and with the limited therapeutic options available, further in vivo studies using animal
models ought to be pursued which will offer vital information pertaining to the appropriate use of trb against these
uncommon pathogens.
8.

in vivo activity of  xxxd3314xxx 

an extensive review of the literature on trb against dermatophyte and nondermatophyte infections suggests that in vivo
data using experimental animal models is scarce. the in vivo
efficacy of oral and topical formulations against dermatophyte
infections has been well established [5,6]. comparative in vivo
studies carried out with  xxxd2235xxx  and ketoconazole in a
guinea pig model of trichophytosis and microsporosis revealed
trb to be superior to the reference compounds, both clinically and mycologically. the excellent antimycotic activity
of trb was also demonstrated after topical treatment of
guinea pig dermatophytoses caused by t. mentagrophytes or
m. canis [47]. cutaneous infections of guinea pigs caused by
c. albicans and vaginal candidiasis in rats responded to topical trb. however, the reference compounds,  xxxd1732xxx 
and  xxxd2640xxx , exhibited activity superior to that of trb
in both models [48].
recently, with the emergence of rare and drug-resistant
molds, there is a rekindled interest in using trb for

and vivo studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a combination of trb and lovastatin against trypanosoma cruzi [54].
in general, in vivo data demonstrating the efficacy of trb
against pathogens of significance in immunocompromised
patients (aspergillosis, zygomycetes, scedosporiosis and
fusarioisis) are lacking, necessitating the promotion of additional in vivo experiments that would establish a correlation
and confirm in vitro observations.

mic: minimum inhibitory concentration.

nondermatophytic infections. a recent study from walzer
et al. evaluated trb against pneumocystis carinii and demonstrated that the 50% inhibitory concentration (mic-50) of
trb against rat p. carinii (now reclassified as p. jirovecii)
was 3.7 µg/ml, a level that cannot be clinically achieved in
serum [49]. this was in disparity to previously published
results that showed moderate efficacy and could be attributed
to variations in testing conditions and the total duration of
therapy employed in the different studies [50]. soresen et al.
demonstrated that trb was inferior to flz in an animal model of coccidioidal meningitis. the authors showed
that, although mean serum trb levels by bioassay were
within the range of 3.5 – 6.2 µg/ml at 1, 2 and 4 h postdosing and 0.35 – 7.0 µg/ml at 14 h postdosing, trb was
not detected in csf. mean flz levels (24 h postdosing)
by bioassay were 16.4 – 19.2 and 13.5 – 19.2 µg/ml in
serum and csf, respectively. the reduction in the numbers of cfu in the spinal cord and brain was more than
100-fold (p = 0.0005) in flz-treated animals and twofold
(p £ 0.2) in trb-treated animals compared with controls.
this study questions the use of trb in infections involving
the central nervous system unless combined with another
antifungal agent [51]. the concentration of trb in brain
parenchyma has not been studied except for published
case reports of successful treatment of brain abscess caused
by s. prolificans.
in two different rabbit models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, trb did not improve survival, despite high doses
(80 mg/kg/day) and adequate lung concentrations. authors
concluded that the poor efficacy was due to lack of

clinical efficacy

clinical studies have shown that the therapeutic potential of
trb extends far beyond its currently licensed indications
(dermatomycoses) to include a broader spectrum of pathogenic fungi. although there are no definite guidelines for
the use of trb, either alone or in combination with other
antifungal agents, for these infections, there are several case
reports of successful management of nondermatophytic
infections including paecilomyces spp [55-57], azole-resistant
candida spp. [58], fusarium spp. [59-60], aspergillus spp. [61,62],
alternaria and curvularia spp. [63,64], phaeohyphomycoses [65],
chromoblastomycosis [66,67], scytalidium spp. [68], scedosporium
spp. [69-73], zygomycoses, cutaneous and lymphocutaneous
sporotrichosis [74], cladophialophora spp. [75], and pythium
spp. [76]. based on published pharmacokinetic data, higher
trb dosage (500 – 1000 mg/day, compared with 250 mg
daily for dermatophytes), are required in the management of
these infections with the goal of achieving the best therapeutic plasma concentration; the recommended duration of
treatment is 3 – 12 months. despite long-term therapy,
toxicity is minimal; monitoring of liver function tests particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease and careful clinical evaluation of patients with cutaneous lupus or
psoriasis must be considered in selected patients.
10.

combination therapy

at present, the major niche for trb in the antifungal
armamentarium is as an adjunct in the management of
various refractory/resistant fungal infections. although
trb does demonstrate a broad spectrum of antifungal
activity, it is considered to be inferior to that of azole
compounds. hence most in vitro studies and subsequent
case reports have focused on the use of trb in combination with other classes of antifungal agents including
polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. the advantages of combination therapy include enhanced antifungal spectrum and
potency, and decreased dosage of individual agents, thereby
reducing toxicity and preventing the emergence of drug
resistance. despite these plausible benefits, there aren’t
sufficient clinical trials supporting the same. combination

and azoles (inhibition of different enzymes in the ergosterol

pathway) has been tried against various fungi with successful
clinical outcome.
there is ample evidence that trb exerts synergistic
interaction with azoles and polyenes (data emerging with
echinocandins), against molds including aspergillus spp.,
scedosporium spp., paecilomyces spp., fusarium spp., and
zygomycetes and has been used on a compassionate basis in
the management of these infections (tables 3 and 4). azole and
trb combinations have been used successfully for infections
due to s. prolificans, a mold that is intrinsically resistant to
polyenes and triazoles. although itz or trb are inactive
alone, when used in combination the mics of itz and trb
dropped significantly (from 16 to 2 µg/ml and from 0.5 to
0.06 µg/ml respectively), and the combination was synergistic in vitro against 95% of isolates of scedosporium spp. [77-79].
fusarium spp. were also susceptible to various combinations of
trb with either  xxxd3528xxx  ( xxxd3528xxx ), caspofungin or
 xxxd164xxx  (amb) [80,81]. in a study from brazil, combination of trb with azoles was found to be synergistic in vitro
against pythium isolates [82].  xxxd3314xxx , in combination with
azoles has also been shown to be effective against azole-resistant
c. albicans and c. glabrata. interestingly, the combination of
trb with calcineurin inhibitors ( xxxd3271xxx  and cyclosporine)
has been shown to be synergistic in vitro against wild-type
2728

c. albicans and some of the intrinsically azole-resistant
candida spp. (c. glabrata and c. krusei) [83-86]. in another
study, the antifungal activity of trb was evaluated against
zygomycetes (rhizopus, rhizomucor, absidia and mucor spp.)
[87]. the combination of trb with amb showed synergy
or indifference in 20% and 80% of isolates whereas with
 xxxd3528xxx  it demonstrated synergy or indifference in 44% and
56% of isolates tested (table 4) [87,88].
the most common mold-causing infection in immunocompromised cancer patients is aspergillus spp.  xxxd3314xxx 
in combination with azoles seems promising, although it
is reported to be less effective when used in combination
with polyenes or  xxxd2119xxx . interestingly, flz also displayed
synergistic or additive activity with trb despite its lack
of intrinsic anti-aspergillus activity [89,90]. combination of
trb with azoles has demonstrated good activity in vitro
against multidrug-resistant scopulariopsis brevicularis [91] and
azole-resistant leishmania braziliensis [92].
although these in vitro observations sound promising,
additional in vivo studies using animal models are needed
to elucidate the potential application of such combination
therapies. also, it is crucial that one recognizes the inherent
limitations of in vitro combination studies and the possible
lack of correlation with clinical outcome.

 xxxd3314xxx  resistance

despite the high incidence of dermatophytic infections, prolonged therapy and noncompliance, the incidence of trb
resistance in dermatophytes is extremely rare. in general,
several different mechanisms either alone or in combination
may contribute to trb drug resistance. as trb is used
sparsely for nondermatophyte infections, clinical resistance
in this group of fungi is unlikely and has not been reported [93].
the target for trb is unique ( xxxg2197xxx  of the fungal cell membrane) and is not shared by any other antifungal
agent in use, and therefore the potential for cross-resistance
is meagre. the expression of multidrug efflux transporters on
exposure to trb was studied in t. rubrum and two different abc (atp-binding casettee) transporters trumdr1
and trumdr2 have been characterized. disruption of theh
trumdr2 gene rendered the mutant strain more susceptible
to trb, suggesting its role in modulating drug susceptibility
in t. rubrum [94]. amino acid mutations (l393f or f397l),
gene upregulation or amplification of the target gene (erg1)
or introduction of extra copies of erg1 gene have been
reported to be associated with trb resistance [95-97]. although
rare, with the widespread use of trb, resistance may be
selected in the dermatophyte population [98,99] with a potential for altering trb susceptibility patterns in nondermatophytic molds that has tremendous clinical implications. this
possibility emphasizes the importance of susceptibility testing when trb is used for the treatment of severe refractory
mycoses. in addition, therapeutic drug monitoring must
be considered to ensure that adequate serum levels are
achieved, as it impacts on therapeutic efficacy, which is a
crucial factor in the management of serious refractory or
resistant nondermatophytic fungal infections.

expert opinion

 xxxd3314xxx  is an allylamine antimycotic agent with oral and
topical activity which has demonstrated excellent fungicidal
activity against dermatophytes with variable activity against
yeasts and nondermatophyte molds in vitro. its efficacy and

safety in dermatophyte infections and toenail onychomycosis
in adults has been well established in many studies. in large
surveillance studies, trb exhibited excellent safety profiles
consistent with results obtained in pivotal studies. additionally, trb has been reported to be superior to both itz and
flz in comparative studies in the treatment of dermatophytoses and toenail onychomycosis. recent studies have reported
trb to be more cost-effective than  xxxd2235xxx , flz or itz.
 xxxd3314xxx  offers several advantages in the management of
onychomycosis in adults including good antifungal efficacy,
broad spectrum of fungicidal activity, excellent safety profile
and minimal drug interactions compared with azoles.
in vitro, trb exhibits a broad spectrum of antifungal activity (albeit to a lesser extent than triazoles) against several nondermatophytic fungi responsible for invasive mycoses. clinical
data, while not abundant, indicate that this in vitro activity
of trb is reflected in its in vivo efficacy. the limited data
show that trb is a useful first-line treatment in chromoblastomycoses. published literature suggests that trb in
combination with azoles is effective in treating azole-resistant
candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, fusariosis
and zygomycoses, which are frequently reported from immunocompromised patients. thus, the therapeutic potential of
trb extends well beyond its approved indication for dermatophytoses to include a wide range of nondermatophytic
systemic mycoses. with reports on the emergence of uncommon fungal infections, some with intrinsic resistance to the
antifungal agents now available, there is a critical necessity to
explore antifungal combination therapy using trb, with a
hope of acheiving clinical success. the antifungal combination with most data available includes trb with triazole (itz
or  xxxd3528xxx ). as clinical trials are unrealistic with rare mycoses,
physicians are compelled to use data from in vitro and in vivo
observations including case reports, to guide therapy with
trb for serious mold infections. with no new antifungal
agents in the pipeline and lack of clinical trial data, it is
essential to augment research on trb combinations in animal
models for serious fungal infections. triazoles inhibit lanosterol demethylase, whereas trb inhibits  xxxg2197xxx 
and the combination results in sequential inhibition of the
fungal ergosterol pathway, contributing to clinically relevant
synergistic activity.
nonetheless, the crucial factor that negates the use of
trb as first-line/monotherapy against serious fungal infections is the fact that, although it rapidly achieves high concentration in the adipose tissue and skin, it takes several days
to achieve a steady fungicidal plasma concentration, with
plasma concentrations lower than that of peripheral tissue.
pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that trb distributes rapidly and extensively to peripheral body fluids and
tissue. the concentrations in sebum and hair samples at any
given time are several-fold higher than simultaneous concentrations in plasma samples, and the average terminal half-life
of trb is 20 – 28 days. being a lipophilic agent, it is likely
that this disposition phase is governed by the slow return of

 xxxd3314xxx 

trb to the central plasma compartment from peripheral
tissue and adipose distribution sites resulting in a prolonged
duration of fungicidal concentrations at peripheral sites.
thus, the unique characteristics of trb that make it a drug
of choice against dermatomycoses and onychomycoses are the
same characterisitics that exclude it as a first-line antifungal
agent for serious, life-threatening fungal infections. despite
these pitfalls, based on the pharmacokinetic features and
in vitro synergistic potential, trb may serve as a valuable
agent in combination with other agents for long-term maintanence therapy with the goal of achieving maximum fungicidal activity and to prevent the development of azole resistance
that is a potential issue in patients on long-term azole therapy.

further modifications of trb to facilitate rapid and sustained therapeutic plasma concentration or research into a
new agent that acts on  xxxg2197xxx  or other enzymes
in the erg pathway will greatly enhance treatment modalities. pending further studies, trb must be considered as
first-line therapy for dermatophytoses and onychomycosis and
as a valuable adjunctive agent in the management of resistant
and refractory nondermatophytic fungal infections.
