the three-dimensional structures of human and rabbit liver cytosolic recombinant serine hydroxymethyltransferases (hcshmt and rcshmt) revealed that e75 and y83 (numbering according to hcshmt) are probable
candidates for proton abstraction and ca-cb bond cleavage in the reaction catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase. both these residues are completely conserved in all serine hydroxymethyltransferases sequenced to
date. in an attempt to decipher the role of these residues in sheep liver cytosolic recombinant serine
hydroxymethyltransferase (scshmt), e74 (corresponding residue is e75 in hcshmt) was mutated to q and k,
and y82 (corresponding residue is y83 in hcshmt) was mutated to f. the specific activities using serine as the
substrate for the e74q and e74k mutant enzymes were drastically reduced. these mutant enzymes catalyzed the
transamination of d-alanine and  xxxd3334xxx  independent retroaldol cleavage of l-allo threonine at
rates comparable with wild-type enzyme, suggesting that e74 was not involved directly in the proton abstraction
step of catalysis, as predicted earlier from crystal structures of hcshmt and rcshmt. there was no change in the
apparent tm value of e74q upon the addition of l-serine, whereas the apparent tm value of scshmt was
enhanced by 10 8c. differential scanning calorimetric data and proteolytic digestion patterns in the presence of
l-serine showed that e74q was different to scshmt. these results indicated that e74 might be required for the
conformational change involved in reaction specificity. it was predicted from the crystal structures of hcshmt
and rcshmt that y82 was involved in hemiacetal formation following ca-cb bond cleavage of l-serine and
mutation of this residue to f could lead to a rapid release of hcho. however, the y82f mutant had only 5% of
the activity and failed to form a quinonoid intermediate, suggesting that this residue is not involved in the
formation of the hemiacetal intermediate, but might be involved indirectly in the abstraction of the proton and in
stabilizing the quinonoid intermediate.

serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx ), a pyridoxal-5 0 phosphate (pyridoxalp)-containing enzyme catalyzes a physiologically important reaction, namely the transfer of the
hydroxymethyl group of serine to  xxxd3334xxx 
(h4-folate) to yield glycine and n 5, n10-methylene h4-folate,
a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of amino acids and
nucleic acids [1,2]. for these reasons, it has been suggested that
 xxxg2068xxx  is a potential target in cancer chemotherapy [3±5]. the
enzyme from prokaryotic sources is a dimer [6], whereas that
from eukaryotic sources is a tetramer [4,7]. it contains 1 mol of
pyridoxalp per mol of subunit with an absorbance maximum at
425 nm. spectrally distinct intermediates are generated during
the reaction of the enzyme with its substrates [3].

the availability of the crystal structures of human liver
cytosolic recombinant  xxxg2068xxx  (hcshmt) [5], rabbit liver
cytosolic recombinant  xxxg2068xxx  (rcshmt) [8] and escherichia
coli  xxxg2068xxx  (eshmt) [9] have enabled a more critical
examination of the role of specific amino acid residues in the
different steps of catalysis. the first step in catalysis is a
nucleophilic attack by the amino group of l-serine on the
internal aldimine (scheme 1, structure i) to form the geminal
diamine (scheme 1, structure ii). r363 in eshmt and the
corresponding residue r401 in sheep liver cytosolic recombinant  xxxg2068xxx  (scshmt) were identified previously as essential
for binding of the  xxxd2154xxx  of the amino acid substrate
[10,11]. the x-ray structure confirmed that this residue is at
hydrogen bonding distance from the  xxxd2154xxx  of the
substrate and is well positioned to carry out this function
[5,8,9]. the geminal diamine structure derived by analogy with
the x-ray structure of the reduced internal aldimine showed that
the position of the pyridoxalp ring was altered to facilitate the
reaction following interaction with the substrate carboxy
residue. it is postulated that conversion from the geminal
diamine to external aldimine (scheme 1, structure iii) occurs
via proton transfer from the substrate amino group to k256 and
that the orientation of the pyridoxalp ring is perpendicular to
the bond that is being cleaved. mutation of the k256 in
scshmt led to the loss of pyridoxalp and disruption of the

1-amino group of k256 are linked to pyridoxalp. this intermediate absorbs at 343 nm. the external aldimine, which absorbs at 425 nm (iii) of pyridoxalp
and the substrate, is formed by breaking the bond between 1-amino group of k256 and pyridoxalp. the abstraction of the proton from the hydroxy group of
l-serine possibly by e74 and/or y82 results in the formation of the quinonoid intermediate (iv), absorbing at 492.5 nm. h4-folate enhances the formation of
the quinonoid intermediate and n 5,n10-ch2-h4-folate. pyridoxalp-glycine external aldimine (v) absorbing at 425 nm is converted to the corresponding
geminal diamine (vi) (absorbing at 343 nm) by reaction with 1-amino group of k256. release of the product glycine results in the formation of internal
aldimine (i) for the next round of catalysis. adapted from schirch [3].

oligomeric structure [12], as this lys residue is located at the
interface of the tight dimers [5,8,9]. from the three-dimensional
structure of hcshmt and rcshmt, it is apparent that the side
chains of e74 and y82 are oriented towards the -oh group of
the serine [5,8]. abstraction of the proton from the hydroxy
group of serine followed by ca-cb bond cleavage leads to the
formation of the quinonoid intermediate with an absorbance
maximum at 492.5 nm (scheme 1, structure iv). the formaldehyde formed during this process is transferred to the n 5, n10
position of the h4-folate, which enhances the rate of proton
abstraction. subsequently, the external aldimine is formed with
the product, glycine (scheme 1, structure v), which is converted to the geminal diamine (scheme 1, structure vi). the
catalytic cycle is completed by the release of glycine and
formation of internal aldimine with the 1-amino group of k256
(scheme 1, structure i).
it was suggested from analysis of modeled ternary complex
of serine and h4-folate of the rcshmt that the pteridine ring of

directly accept the c3-hydroxy group of l-serine to its n 5, n10
positions. the phenolic group of y82, which interposes
between the hydroxymethyl group of the l-serine and the

n 5, n10 positions of h4-folate, could form a hemiacetal with the
formyl group produced by the deprotonation of the hydroxy
group of serine by e74 [8]. it was also proposed that the short
hydrogen bond between y82 and exocyclic o4 of the pteridine
ring could activate the y82 hydroxy group for the formation of
such an intermediate. this would place the hemiacetal group
ê from n5 of the folate to which it is to be transferred. it

was therefore suggested that y82 could serve as a shuttle for
the hydroxymethyl group between l-serine-external aldimine
and the folate cofactor or form the hemiacetal directly by a sn2
displacement at the ca-bond. it was postulated that if this
hypothesis was true, the y82f mutant should cleave serine
rapidly and release formaldehyde [8].
in order to examine the functions of y82 and e74 as
postulated above [5,8], y82 was mutated to f and e74 to q and
k in scshmt. our results show that e74 is not involved in
abstracting the proton from hydroxymethyl group of l-serine
but participates in converting the enzyme from an open to
closed form upon the addition of l-serine. it is also clear that
y82 is not involved in the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate but has a role in stabilizing the quinonoid intermediate.
the mutation of this residue may indirectly affect the formation

bangalore genei pvt. ltd (bangalore, india). h4-folate was
prepared as described by hatefi et al. [13].
bacterial strains, growth conditions and dna manipulations
e. coli strain dh5a (bethesda research labs, usa) was the
recipient for all the plasmids used for dna isolations and
subcloning. bl21 (de3) plyss strain [14] was used for the
expression of scshmt [15], e74q, e74k and y82f  xxxg2068xxx 
mutant clones. luria±bertani medium or terrific broth (24 g
of yeast extract, 12 g of tryptone, 4 ml of glycerol, 2.31 g of
kh2po4 and 12.54 g k2hpo4 per l) with 50 mg´ml21 of
ampicillin was used to grow e. coli cells containing the
plasmids at 37 8c. plasmids were prepared using the alkaline
lysis procedure described by sambrook et al. [16]. dna fragments were eluted from low-melting point agarose gels after
electrophoresis [16].
subcloning of  xxxg2068xxx  gene from pet vector to prset `c'
vector and site-directed mutagenesis
the full-length gene for scshmt (1452 bp) was released from
petsh (pet-3e vector containing the full length gene of
scshmt) [15] by double digestion using ndei and bamhi
restriction enzymes. this fragment was ligated to prset `c', a
t7 promoter-based expression vector previously double
digested with ndei and bamhi. the positive clones (prsh,
prset `c' vector containing the full-length gene of scshmt)
were confirmed by restriction digestion and dna sequencing.
the smaller size (2.9 kb) of prset `c' enabled easy generation of mutants directly in this expression vector. the pcr
conditions used to polymerize the complete vector were as
follows. the wild-type template (prsh; 80 ng), sense and antisense primers (50 pmol) were added to pcr tubes containing
0.2 mm dntps, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2.5 u of deep vent polymerase
along with the buffer provided with the enzyme at 1
concentration. amplification was carried out in a perkin±
elmer pcr machine using the following cycling conditions:
denaturation of the template at 95 8c for 4 min followed by 20
cycles at 94 8c for 45 s (denaturation), 52 8c for 1 min
(annealing) and 72 8c for 5 min (extension). the reaction was
continued for 20 min at 72 8c to complete the extension. sense
and antisense primers for e74q (sense: 5 0 -aagtactctcag-

gggtaccca-3 0 , antisense: 5 0 -tgggtacccctgagagtactt-3 0 ), e74k (sense: 5 0 -aagtactctaaggggtaccca3 0 , antisense: 5 0 -tgggtaccccttagagtactt-3 0 ) and
y82f (sense: 5 0 -cagaggtactttggtgggacg-3 0 , antisense: 5 0 -cgtcccaccaaagtacctctg-3 0 ) were used on
prsh template to construct site-directed mutants. the pcr
amplified mixture was treated with dpni (10 units) at 37 8c for
1 h to digest the methylated dna (template dna) and
transformed into dh5a-competent cells. the presence of the
mutations were confirmed by sequencing the plasmid dna by
sanger's dideoxy chain termination method [17] using
sequenasetm version 2.0 sequencing kit (data not shown).
expression and purification of mutant enzymes
petsh, e74q, e74k and y82f plasmids were transformed
into e. coli bl21(de3) plys s strain. scshmt, e74q, e74k
and y82f mutants were grown at 30 8c and purified using the
protocol standardized for scshmt earlier [18]. the enzyme
pellet was dialyzed against the buffer a (50 mm potassium
phosphate buffer ph 7.4, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta)
for 24 h with two changes (1 l) prior to use. protein was
estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, 1 absorbance unit was equivalent to 1.2 mg´ml21 [19].
enzyme assays
hydroxymethyltransferase reaction.  xxxg2068xxx  catalyzed aldol
cleavage of l-serine with h4-folate to form glycine and
n 5 , n10 -ch2-h4-folate was monitored using l-[3-14 c]-serine
and h4-folate as substrates as described previously [20,21]. one
unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
that catalyzed the formation of 1 mmol of formaldehyde by the
decomposition of n 5, n10-ch2-h4-folate per min at 37 8c at
ph 7.4. specific activity was expressed as units per mg of
protein. to determine km and kcat values, the assay was carried
out at varying concentrations of serine (0±4 mm) and the
kinetic parameters were calculated by least square fitting of the
data on double reciprocal plots.
 xxxg2068xxx -catalyzed h4-folate independent aldol cleavage of
l-allo threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde [22] was monitored at 340 nm by the nadh-dependent reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol and nad1 by  xxxg110xxx  present
in an excess amount in the reaction mixture as described previously [23]. the nadh consumed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m21´cm21
[24]. kcat was defined as mol of nadh consumed per mol of
subunit per s. the kinetic constants km and kcat were calculated
using double reciprocal plots.
transaminase activity.  xxxg2068xxx  catalyzes the transamination of
d-alanine to give pyruvate and the bound pyridoxalp is converted to 5-pyridoxamine 5 0 -phosphate [25]. scshmt, e74q
and y82f (1 mg´ml21) were taken separately in 900 ml of
buffer a and the absorbance was measured at 425 nm against
the same buffer blank in a shimadzu uv-160 a spectrophotometer after pre-incubation at 37 8c for 3 min. the
reaction was started by the addition of 100 ml of 1 m dalanine to both cuvettes. absorbance change at 425 nm was
monitored and the pseudo-first order rate constants were
calculated as described previously [18].
spectroscopic methods
absorption spectra. absorption spectra of the enzymes were
recorded in a shimadzu uv-160a spectrophotometer in

5970 j. v. krishna rao et al. (eur. j. biochem. 267)

buffer a. all the spectra were recorded at 25 ^ 2 8c against
buffer a and the protein concentration used was 1 mg´ml21.
cd spectra. cd measurements were made in jasco j-500a
automated recording spectropolarimeter. spectra were collected
at a scan speed of 10 nm´min21 and a response time of 16 s.
far-uv cd spectra were recorded at 25 ^ 2 8c in buffer a
using the same buffer as the blank from 250 to 195 nm. the
protein concentration corresponding to a280 value of 0.1 per
ml21 was used for far-uv cd studies. the cuvettes used for
far-uv cd measurements had path length of 1 mm. the cd
spectra obtained were plotted as molar ellipticity (ume)
assuming a relative subunit mr of 52 900 da for the enzymes.
ume  u  100  m r /c  d
where u is the observed ellipticity (in degrees), mr is the
concentration of the protein in mg´ml21 and d is the path
length in dm (0.01 nm).
visible cd spectra were recorded from 500 to 300 nm using
1 mg´ml21 protein concentration in buffer a with or without
substrates (l-serine/glycine)
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra. intrinsic flourescence measurements were made at 25 8c using jasco fp 777
spectrofluorimeter. the protein concentration corresponding to
an a280 value of 0.1 per ml was used. the excitation
wavelength was 280 nm and emmission spectra were recorded
from 300 to 400 nm.
thermal stability
thermal denaturation of scshmt, e74q and y82f was
performed in a gilford response ii spectrophotometer from
ciba corning diagnostics (oberlin, oh, usa) as described by
jagath et al. [18]. the absorbance change was monitored at
287 nm. the first derivative of the thermal denaturation profile
obtained using the software supplied with the instrument, was
used to evaluate the apparent transition temperatures for the
proteins. the apparent denaturation temperature (apparent tm)
is defined as the temperature at which the value of the fraction
of the protein in the denatured state was 0.5.
differential scanning calorimetric measurements
differential scanning calorimetric (dsc) experiments were
carried out on a micro cal mc-2 ultra sensitive dsc, micro
cal inc. (ma, usa). protein samples were dialyzed against
buffer a either with 100 mm l-serine or without l-serine for
12 h at 4 8c with three changes of 250 ml buffer a. the final
dialysate was used in the reference cell. a protein concentration
of 3.5 mg´ml21 (0.066 m) was used in all experiments. all the
protein solutions and buffer were degassed with gentle stirring
under vacuum before being loaded into the calorimeter.
experiments were performed over a range of temperatures
(30±90 8c) at a scan rate of 1.5 8c´min21. normalized heat
capacity (cp) data were corrected for buffer base line. raw data
from the dsc run were analyzed using origintm (version 2.9)
scientific plotting software. the dsc heat capacity was curve
fitted using non-two-state fit.
proteolytic cleavage
proteolytic digestions of scshmt and e74q mutant enzymes
were carried out using 5% trypsin (w/w) in 250 ml reaction
mixture. one milligram of the protein (either with or without

q febs 2000

50 mm l-serine/glycine) and 50 mg of trypsin were incubated
at 37 8c for 1 h in buffer a. extracts were analyzed on 15%
sds/page.

physico-chemical and catalytic properties of e74q, e74k and
y82f shmts
scshmt and mutant proteins, e74q, e74k and y82f were
overexpressed in e. coli bl21(de3) plys s strain. considerable quantities of the expressed proteins were present in the
soluble fractions. the yields of the purified mutant proteins
were < 10 mg´l21 compared with 40±50 mg of scshmt per
l of medium. the purified proteins showed a single band on
sds/page analysis corresponding to a mr of 53 kda indicating
homogeneity (data not shown). mutant proteins were eluted
from a calibrated superose-12 hr 10/30 gel filtration column
with a mr < 220 kda (fig. 1a), indicating that all were
homotetramers. this observation suggested that mutations did
not lead to alteration in the oligomeric structure of these mutant
shmts. the far-uv cd spectra of scshmt and the mutants
overlapped with each other indicating that the mutations also
did not result in any gross change in the secondary structure.
the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of mutants were
also similar to that of scshmt (data not shown). the mutants
contained 1 mmol of pyridoxalp per mmol of subunit. e74q
and e74k  xxxg2068xxx  had a specific activity of 0.012 and
0.004 u´mg21, respectively, compared with 4.2 u´mg21
observed with scshmt (table 1) suggesting that the mutations
had resulted in a considerable loss of activity. the km value of
serine for e74q was 1.5 mm, similar to that of scshmt
(table 1). the kcat /km value was decreased by 410-fold
compared with that of scshmt. interestingly, the hydroxymethyltransferase activity of the e74q mutant enzyme in the
absence of h4-folate was 0.013 u´mg21 compared with no
detectable activity in the case of scshmt. addition of h4folate had no effect on the activity of mutant, whereas the
activity of scshmt increased to 4.2 u´mg21. the mutation of
y 82 to f (y82f) also resulted in a significant decrease in
activity from 4.2 u´mg21 for scshmt to 0.16 u´mg21. the
km for l-serine was decreased from 1 mm for scshmt to
0.3 mm. the kcat /km value for this mutant decreased by fivefold
compared with that of scshmt (table 1).
spectral intermediates
e74q, e74k, y82f and scshmts gave a spectrum characteristic of an enzyme containing pyridoxalp-internal aldimine [25]
(fig. 2, curve e). the visible cd spectra of the mutants in the
range of 300±500 nm were also similar to that of scshmt,
indicating that the pyridoxalp at the active site was present in a
similar micro-environment in the bulk solvent (data not shown).
in view of the observation that the catalytic activities of e74q,
e74k were significantly lower than that of scshmt (table 1),
it was of interest to determine which catalysis step was affected
by the mutation. addition of glycine to scshmt resulted in the
formation of a geminal diamine (343 nm) and external aldimine
(425 nm, fig. 2a, curve 1), as shown by the spectroscopic data.
upon addition of h4-folate to this mixture, a prominent peak at
492.5 nm, corresponding to the quinonoid intermediate, was
observed (fig. 2a, curve 2). interestingly, when glycine was
added to either e74q or e74k, a distinct peak of the quinonoid
intermediate was observed even in the absence of h4-folate
(fig. 2b,c, curve 1). addition of h4-folate enhanced the

fig. 1. size-exclusion chromatography and visible absorbance spectra of scshmt, e74q and y82f. the enzymes (150 mg in 500 ml of buffer a) were
loaded onto a superose-12 hr 10/30 fplc column and developed using the same buffer. the column was calibrated using standard molecular mass markers,
blue dextran (2 000 000 da),  xxxg818xxx  (443 000 da), b-amylase (200 000 da),  xxxg110xxx  (150 000 da) and carbonic anhydrase (29 000 da)
in buffer a. (a) holo scshmt, e74q and y82f were eluted with a retention volume of 10.1 ml corresponding to a molecular mass of 220 kda. the subunit
molecular mass of scshmt estimated previously by sds/page analysis was 53 kda [15]. (b) apoenzymes were prepared by reaction with d-alanine.
aposcshmt and e74q were eluted at with a retention volume of 10.1 ml and y82f with a 10.9-ml, corresponding to the tetramer and dimer, respectively.
(c) apoenzymes were reconstituted (rc) by the addition of 500 mm pyridoxalp and incubated for 2 h prior to loading. while rc scshmt and rc e74q
eluted as tetramers (10.1 ml), rc y82f eluted as a mixture of dimers and tetramers. (d) absorbance spectra of reconstituted enzymes (1 mg´ml21).
reconstitution was indicated by the appearance of an absorbance peak at 425 nm due to the formation of an internal aldimine. all the three apoenzymes were
reconstituted to the original absorbance of 425 nm.

concentration of quinonoid intermediate when scshmt, e74q
or e74k were used (fig. 2a±c curve 2). it was observed that
the lmax of the quinonoid intermediate generated upon addition
of h4-folate to the e74q  xxxg2068xxx ±glycine complex was shifted
to 496.5 nm from 492.5 nm. this probably reflects a change in
the environment of the active site of the mutants, especially the
orientation of pyridoxalp ring. addition of glycine to y82f
mutant resulted in the formation of geminal diamine (fig. 2d,
curve 1). however, addition of h4-folate did not result in
formation of the quinonoid intermediate (fig. 2d, curve 2),
even though the mutant was more active than e74q and e74k
(table 1).

effect of l-serine and hcho on the quinonoid intermediate
it has been suggested that h4-folate is involved in the rapid
removal of hcho generated at the active site and that the
quinonoid intermediate is not readily seen when l-serine and
h4-folate are added to the enzyme [3]. as mentioned earlier,
mutation of e74 could affect the abstraction of the proton from
external aldimine and/or ca-cb bond cleavage, leading to the
formation of hcho. it was therefore important to examine
the effect of hcho and l-serine on the concentration of the
quinonoid intermediate generated by addition of glycine and
h4-folate to scshmt and e74q. it can be seen from fig. 3 that
addition of hcho (10 or 60 mm) to a mixture of scshmt,
glycine and h4-folate resulted in a marked decrease in the
concentration of the quinonoid intermediate (fig. 3a). similarly, addition of hcho (10 and 60 mm) to quinonoid
intermediate generated by the addition of glycine and h4folate to e74q mutant resulted in a decrease in absorbance at
496.5 nm (fig. 3c). this observation suggested that the
mutation had probably not affected the removal of hcho
from the active site. in order to examine the possibility of the
mutation affecting the cleavage of the ca-cb bond, hcho was
generated in situ by addition of serine to a mixture of glycine,
h4-folate and scshmt (fig. 3b). it can be seen that the concentration of the quinonoid intermediate decreased with
increasing concentration of l-serine and reached a basal value
at 60 mm l-serine. similarly, in the case of e74q (fig. 3d), the

reaction with d-alanine and l-allo threonine
in addition to catalyzing retro aldol cleavage of l-serine in the
closed form, the enzyme also catalyzes transamination with
d-alanine [26] and h4-folate independent retro aldol cleavage
of l-allo threonine [22] in the open form [27]. in order to

examine the effects of mutation on reaction specificity,
transamination and retro aldol cleavage of l-allo threonine of
scshmt and mutants were monitored. it can be seen from
table 2 that the pseudo-first order rate constants for the
reaction with d-alanine for the e74q and y82f mutants were
similar to that of scshmt, suggesting that the mutations did not
affect this reaction.
the kcat value for the l-allo threonine reaction catalyzed by
e74q (3.17 s21) was similar to that of scshmt (3.7 s21),
although there was a 10-fold increase in the km value. in the
case of y82f, both the kcat and km values decreased and the

formation of apoenzyme and its reconstitution
the transamination reaction with d-alanine has been used to
prepare apoenzyme of  xxxg2068xxx . earlier observations from this
laboratory indicated that removal of pyridoxalp from several
mutants led to dissociation of the tetramer to a dimer [18,28].
scshmt, e74q and y82f were isolated as tetramers with
bound pyridoxalp, as revealed by size-exclusion chromatography (fig. 1a) and visible absorbance spectra (fig. 2, curve
e). removal of pyridoxalp from scshmt and e74q resulted
in the formation of apotetramer (fig. 1b) which could be

reconstituted to the holoenzyme (fig. 1c) with a characteristic
absorbance of the internal aldimine (fig. 1d). in contrast,
removal of pyridoxalp from y82f mutant resulted in an apoenzyme, which was present predominantly as a dimer (fig. 1b).
addition of pyridoxalp to this mutant apoenzyme resulted in the
partial conversion of the dimer to a holotetramer (fig. 1c,d)
with regain of the enzyme activity (0.06 u´mg21, corresponding to the amount of tetramer). these results suggest that the
aposcshmt, e74q and y82f can be reconstituted to the
holoenzymes suggesting that these residues are not crucial for
the maintenance of the oligomeric structure of  xxxg2068xxx .
substrate-induced stability
it has been suggested that addition of l-serine to  xxxg2068xxx 
converts the enzyme from an open to a closed form in which the
reaction with l-serine and h4-folate occurs. this conversion is

observed with apex values of 44, 63 and 81 8c upon addition
of l-serine to e74q (fig. 4d). it is not clear why dsc
thermograms are bimodal for scshmt and multimodal for
e74q in the presence l-serine. however, one plausible
explanation could be that the conformational change induced
by the binding of l-serine to scshmt leads to a closed form
and binding to e74q leads to a structurally different entity. the
dsc thermograms of y82f were similar to scshmt either in
the presence or absence of l-serine (data not shown).
the structural differences in scshmt and e74q were also
examined by monitoring the sensitivity of the enzyme to tryptic
digestion in the presence and absence of substrates and
analyzing the products on 15% sds/page. it can be seen
from fig. 5 that the proteolytic digestion pattern of scshmt in
the absence and presence of l-serine was similar (lanes 3 and 5,
respectively). the pattern of digested fragments of e74q was
similar to that of scshmt in the absence of l-serine (lane 7). it
is interesting to observe that, in the case of e74q, an additional
band corresponding to a mr < 35 kda was seen in the presence
of l-serine (lane 9). this suggested that the sensitivity of e74q
to trypsin in the presence of l-serine was different to that of
scshmt. however, identical patterns were observed when
scshmt and e74q were digested with trypsin in the presence
of glycine (data not shown).

accompanied by an increase in thermal stability as reported
previously [27]. the apparent tm value determined using
gilford spectrophotometer was 55 8c and increased to 65 8c
upon addition of l-serine to scshmt. however, addition of
glycine to scshmt did not increase the apparent tm value,
indicating the specific interaction of scshmt with l-serine. in
contrast, addition of l-serine or glycine to e74q did not
increase the apparent tm value of 55 8c (table 3). an increase
in the apparent tm value to 68 8c was observed when l-serine
was added to y82f, whereas the apparent tm value remained at
55 8c upon the addition of glycine. these results clearly
indicate that the thermal coagulation temperature (a temperaturedependent phenomena) is enhanced by the specific interaction
of l-serine with scshmt and y82f, which is necessary for
physiological reactions to occur.
in order to quantify these apparent tm value changes, dsc
studies were performed both with enzyme alone and in the
presence of l-serine in the temperature range of 30±90 8c at
increments of 1.5 8c´min21. the dsc thermograms of scshmt
and e74q in buffer a show a typical and symmetrical pattern
with a few other domains also having enthalpic peaks
(fig. 4a,b). however, 95% of the peak area is represented by
a sharp transition in the region of 59 ^ 1 8c for scshmt and
e74q. a similar pattern was observed upon addition of glycine
to either of the enzymes (data not shown). scshmt showed a
bimodal pattern in the presence of l-serine with a leading peak
followed by a trailing peak with apex values of 78 and 72 8c
(fig. 4c). contrasting this observation, three peaks were

discussion
a major objective in the study of any enzyme-catalyzed
reaction is the elucidation of the role of specific amino acids in
the proposed catalytic mechanism. analysis of the structural
features of hcshmt and rcshmt led to the proposition that
e75 and e57 (equivalent residues) are involved in abstraction of
the proton from the hydroxy group of l-serine [5,8]. critical
examination of the recently determined structure of eshmt-5formyl h4-folate-glycine ternary complex suggested that this
residue (e57) is in a protonated form and that the carbonyl
oxygen is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule from which it
must be accepting a proton. it is close to the protonated n10
atom of folate carrying the methylene group [9]. this analysis
raises some doubts about the role of this residue as a primary
proton acceptor from the hydroxy group of l-serine.
the sequence identity (94%) of scshmt with hcshmt
suggested that it may have a similar three-dimensional structure. e74 corresponds to e75 and e57 in hcshmt and
rcshmt, respectively. it can be seen from table 1 that the
mutation of e74 to q led to a marked decrease in hydroxymethyltransferase activity (0.012 u´mg21). the residual activity could be monitored conveniently (table 1). the similar km
value for l-serine suggested that the interaction of the enzyme
with l-serine was probably not seriously affected by mutation
(table 1). the characteristic cd intensity at 425 nm of
scshmt was decreased by < 50% upon addition of 100 mm
l-serine. a similar decrease in cd intensity was observed with
e74q, suggesting that the mutant was capable of binding serine
as efficiently as scshmt (data not shown). these results
suggest that a step in catalysis beyond substrate binding may be
affected. the observation that comparable amounts of the
quinonoid intermediate (0.35 and 0.39 mmol per mmol of
subunit of scshmt and e74q, respectively) were seen in the
presence of glycine and h4-folate with both e74q and scshmt
suggested that the proton abstraction step was probably
unaffected by the mutation. it was interesting to observe the
peak corresponding to the quinonoid intermediate upon
addition of glycine to e74q, suggesting that a significant

amount of proton abstraction from the ca-carbon occurs even
in the absence of h4-folate. the small amount of h4-folate
independent hydroxymethyltransfer could be due to the ability
of the mutant to abstract the equivalent proton from the
hydroxymethyl group of serine. the step following formation
of the quinonoid intermediate is the removal of hcho generated at the active site, when l-serine is used as a substrate.
l-serine and hcho decreased the concentration of quinonoid
intermediate in a similar manner (fig. 3), indicating that the
interactions of h4-folate and removal of hcho from the active
site are not probably affected by the mutation.
the structure of eshmt in the presence of n 5-formyl h4folate and glycine has revealed that the carbonyl oxygen atom
of e57 could form an h-bonding interaction with a water
molecule. it is possible that the carbonyl oxygen atom in q
could carry out a similar function and enable proton abstraction
by the e74q mutant. however, the e74k mutant  xxxg2068xxx , which
cannot participate in such interactions, had similar activity
(0.1% of scshmt). this mutant also generated the quinonoid
intermediate upon addition of glycine. furthermore, addition of
h4-folate increased the concentration of the quinonoid intermediate (fig. 2c). these results suggest that the  xxxd2154xxx 
of e74 residue may not function as a proton acceptor. additional support for this suggestion is that h4-folate independent
reactions, such as transamination and retroaldol cleavage of
l-allo threonine (table 2), were unaffected, strongly suggesting
that the mutation has probably incapacitated the enzyme to
undergo the conformational change consequent to l-serine
binding. catalytic efficiency with l-serine as the substrate,
however, decreased by 410-fold (table 1). it is therefore possible
that e74 is involved in the conversion of the enzyme from an
open to a closed conformation which is required for physiological reactions to occur. as demonstrated previously with
 xxxg2068xxx  [18,27], conversion of the open form to the closed
form of the enzyme by l-serine is characterized by its
increased thermal stabilty. in a similar manner, the thermal
stability of scshmt is enhanced by addition of l-serine but
not glycine (table 3). however, the thermal stability of e74q
was not enhanced by the interaction with l-serine or glycine
(table 3).
this is further confirmed by dsc data which suggest the
possibility of a few critical domains or patches in the protein
becoming very fragile or very stable upon the interaction of
scshmt and its mutants with l-serine. addition of l-serine
may have modified e74q in such a way that these domains
behave rather independently, as suggested by peak values in
which the total enthalpic contribution of the protein molecule is
provided by two or more domains. it is likely that under `stress
conditions', such as binding of ligand, structural changes or
additional patches could be induced in the protein resulting in
new transitions. the dsc data of e74q and scshmt in the
absence of ligand and the presence of glycine were, however,
identical, suggesting that thermal unfolding of these enzymes
was identical and no conformational change occurs in the
presence of glycine.
the altered conformation upon binding of l-serine in the
case of e74q was also monitored by differential susceptibility
to tryptic digestion. sds/page patterns of tryptic digests of
scshmt and e74q in the presence or absence of glycine were
very similar, as were the tryptic digestion patterns of scshmt
either alone or in the presence of l-serine were similar (fig. 5,
lanes 3 and 5). however, the appearance of an additional
< 35 kda band in the sds/page of e74q in the presence of
l-serine (fig. 5, lane 9) suggested that this mutant was
converted to a new conformation different to the closed form

generated by the interaction of l-serine to scshmt, as well as
to the open form.
the following observations support the contention that e74
may be involved in conversion of the enzyme from an open to a
closed form and that the mutation to q or k hampers this
conversion. e74q was characterized by limited physiological
reaction in the absence of h4-folate, a prominent quinonoid
intermediate peak upon the addition of glycine alone, inability
to enhance thermal stabilty in the presence of l-serine,
multimodal thermograms of dsc in the presence of l-serine
and altered susceptibility to tryptic digestion in the presence of
l-serine.
in addition to the role of e74 in the catalysis, it was postulated that y82 was involved in the formation of hemiacetal
intermediate with the formyl group produced by ca±cb bond
cleavage [5,8]. our results clearly show that mutation of this
residue did not cause a marked decrease in activity either with
serine or alternate substrates thereby implying that y82 may
not have a crucial role in catalysis. it was also postulated by
scarsdale et al. [8] that if hemiacetal hypothesis was correct
then the y82f mutant should cleave serine and rapidly release
formaldehyde. a rapid release of hcho after the addition of
l-serine to y82f was not observed. the absence of a quinonoid
intermediate in the presence of glycine and h4-folate may be
due to the effect of this residue on the stability of the quinonoid
intermediate.
the results presented here show that e74 is not involved in
abstracting the proton from hydroxymethyl group of l-serine,
but in the conversion of the enzyme from an open to a closed
form. y82, is not involved directly in proton abstraction or
ca-cb bond cleavage, but may have a role in stabilizing the
quinoniod intermediate.
