abstract
the current armamentarium for the chemotherapy of viral infections consists of 37 licensed antiviral drugs. for the treatment of human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infections, 19 compounds have been formally approved: (i) the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(nrtis) zidovudine, didanosine,  xxxd3546xxx , stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir and emtricitabine; (ii) the nucleotide reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (ntrti) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; (iii) the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis) nevirapine, delavirdine
and efavirenz; (iv) the protease inhibitors saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir,  xxxd166xxx , lopinavir (combined with ritonavir at a 4/1
ratio) and  xxxd239xxx ; and the viral entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infections, lamivudine
as well as adefovir dipivoxil have been approved. among the anti-herpesvirus agents, acyclovir, valaciclovir, penciclovir (when applied
topically),  xxxd2081xxx ,  xxxd2323xxx  and  xxxd3434xxx  (both applied topically) as well as brivudin are used in the treatment of herpes simplex
virus (hsv) and/or varicella-zoster virus (vzv) infections; and ganciclovir, valganciclovir,  xxxd2157xxx , cidofovir and fomivirsen (the latter
upon intravitreal injection) have proven useful in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (cmv) infections in immunosuppressed patients (i.e.
aids patients with cmv retinitis). following amantadine and rimantadine, the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir have
recently become available for the therapy (and prophylaxis) of influenza virus infections. ribavirin has been used (topically, as aerosol) in
the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infections, and the combination of ribavirin with (pegylated) interferon-alpha has received
increased acceptance for the treatment of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections.

1. introduction

2. anti-hiv compounds

the current antiviral drug armamentarium comprises almost 40 compounds that have been officially approved for
clinical use. most of the approved drugs date from the last 5
years, and at least half of them are used for the treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infections. the other
antivirals that are currently available are primarily used for
the treatment of hepatitis b virus (hbv), herpesvirus (herpes
simplex virus (hsv), varicella-zoster virus (vzv), and cytomegalovirus (cmv)), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial
virus (rsv) and hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections. this article should be considered as an update of the review article
on “antiviral drugs: current state of the art” published previously in the journal of clinical virology (de clercq, 2001).

scheme 5. model for hiv-1 envelope fusion with the cell membrane and inhibition of fusion by enfuvirtide (t20). binding of cd4 to the gp120
subunit induces exposure of a conserved region in gp120 implicated in coreceptor binding. binding to coreceptor could bring the viral envelope in closer
proximity to the target membrane, enabling the fusion peptide to insert in the bilayer, or it could impact formation of the six-helix bundle, the transition
to which leads to membrane fusion. enfuvirtide binds to the grooves on the outside of the triple-stranded coiled-coil formed by the nh2 -terminal helices.
therefore, it prevents transition to the six-helix bundle and membrane fusion (after doms and moore, 2000).

3. anti-hbv compounds

it can interact with viral dna synthesis, it needs to be phosphorylated intracellularly, in three steps, to the triphosphate form. the first phosphorylation
step is ensured by the hsv-encoded thymidine kinase (tk), and is therefore confined to virus-infected cells (after de clercq, 2002a).

a total of 37 antiviral compounds (not including interferons or immunoglobulins) have momentarily been licensed
for the treatment of hiv, hbv, herpesvirus, influenza virus
and/or hcv infections. in the preceding sections these compounds have been discussed from the following viewpoints:
chemical structure, activity spectrum, mechanism of action,
principal clinical indication(s), route(s) of administration
and dosage. other points that need to be considered before
the full clinical potential of any given drug could be appreciated, are: (i) duration of treatment, (ii) single- versus
multiple-drug therapy, (iii) pharmacokinetics, (iv) drug interactions, (v) toxic side effects and (vi) development of resistance.
a particular issue that may be important in the clinical setting is whether the listed anti-hiv agents would be
equally suited for the treatment of hiv-2 and hiv-1 infections. as reported by witvrouw et al. (2004), the nrtis and
the ntrti tenofovir are equally active against hiv-1 and
hiv-2; for the nnrtis, anti-hiv activity is confined to the
hiv-1 strains; protease inhibitors are equally active against
hiv-1 and hiv-2, although  xxxd166xxx  shows reduced activity against hiv-2, and, likewise, enfuvirtide has reduced
inhibitory activity against hiv-2.
as to the duration of treatment, this may vary from a
few days (hsv, vzv, influenza virus infections) to several
months or years (hiv, hbv and hcv infections), depending on whether we are dealing with an acute (primary (i.e.
influenza) or recurrent (i.e. hsv, vzv)) infection or chronic,
persistent (i.e. hiv, hbv, hcv) infection. for hiv infections it is still being evaluated whether long-term treatment
can be interrupted, without loss of benefit (or increased benefit) to the patient (structured treatment interruption, sti).
while the short-term treatment (5–7 days) of hsv, vzv
and influenza virus infections, and even the more prolonged
treatment of cmv infections, can be based on single-drug
therapy, for the long-term treatment of hiv infections
combination of several drugs in a triple-drug cocktail (also
referred to as haart for “highly active anti-retroviral
therapy”) has become the standard procedure, and likewise,
the long-term treatment of hbv infections may in the future
also evolve from single- to dual- or triple-drug therapy.
pharmacokinetic parameters to be addressed, when evaluating the therapeutic potential, include bioavailability (upon
either topical, oral or parenteral administration), plasma protein binding affinity, distribution through the organism (penetration into the cns, when this is needed), metabolism
through the liver (i.e. cytochrome p-450 drug-metabolizing
enzymes) and elimination through the kidney. particularly
when concocting the multiple-drug combinations for the
treatment of hiv infection, possible drug–drug interactions
should be taken into account: i.e. some compounds act as
p-450 inhibitors and others as p-450 inducers, and this may
greatly influence the plasma drug levels achieved, especially
in the case of nnrtis and pis.

132

e. de clercq / journal of clinical virology 30 (2004) 115–133

toxic side effects, both short- and long-term, must be
considered when the drugs have to be administered for a
prolonged period, as in the treatment of hiv infections.
these side effects may seriously compromise compliance
(adherence to drug intake), and could, at least in part, be
circumvented by a reduction of the pill burden to, ideally,
once-daily dosing.
finally, resistance development may be an important issue, again for those compounds that have to be taken for a
prolonged period, as is generally the case for most of the
nrtis, nnrtis and pis currently used in the treatment of
hiv infections. yet, the nucleoside phosphonate analogues
(ntrtis) tenofovir and adefovir do not readily or rapidly
lead to resistance development, even after more than 1 year
of therapy (for hiv and hbv, respectively). resistance has
been noted with hbv against lamivudine after long-term
therapy (>6 months), but, if resistant to lamivudine, hbv
infections remain amenable to treatment with adefovir dipivoxil. as has been occasionally observed in immunosuppressed patients, hsv may develop resistance to acyclovir,
and cmv to ganciclovir, but, if based on acv tk or cmv
pk deficiency, these resistant viruses remain amenable to
treatment with  xxxd2157xxx  and/or cidofovir. in immunocompetent patients, treated for an acute or episodic hsv, vzv
or influenza virus infection, short-term therapy is unlikely
to engender any resistance problems.

7. antiviral agents in (pre)clinical development
in addition to the 37 antiviral compounds that are currently
available, there are another 40 or so that are presently under
(pre)clinical development.
for hiv (de clercq, in press), these include the virus
adsorption inhibitors (cosalane derivatives, cyanovirin-n,
cyclotriazadisulfonamide (cada) derivatives, teicoplanin
aglycons and bms-378806); the cxcr4 antagonist
amd070 (de clercq, 2003c); the ccr5 antagonists
sch-c, sch-d, tak-220, spirodiketopiperazine e913,
mrk-1 (cmpd167), and trisubstituted pyrrolidines; the
nrtis (±)-2 -deoxy-3 -oxa-4 -thiacytidine (dotc) and the
5-fluoro-substituted derivative thereof (fdotc), amdoxovir
(dapd), reverset (␤-d-d4fc) and alovudine (fddthd); the
nnrtis uc-781, sj-3366, dpc-083, (+)-calanolide a,
capravirine (ag1549, s-1153) and dapivirine (tmc-125);
the integrase inhibitors s-1360 (and other diketoacid derivatives), 1,6-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide, 8-hydroxy-[1,6]
naphthyridine and pyranodipyrimidine (pdp) derivatives;
and peptidomimetic (i.e. tmc-126) and non-peptidomimetic
(i.e. tipranavir, pnu-140690) protease inhibitors. of these
compounds, tipranavir as well as some of the nrtis (e.g.
reverset) and nnrtis (e.g. capravirine, dapivirine) may
nowadays seem closest to eventual regulatory approval.
for hbv, in addition to the licensed drugs lamivudine and
adefovir dipivoxil, a number of new nucleoside analogues,
viz. entacavir, l-dt and the valine ester of l-dc, as well

as emtricitabine (already in use for hiv/aids), are coming along; and for hcv, a variety of compounds targeted at
either the viral protease, helicase or rna-dependent rna
polymerase (rdrp) are currently under intensive scrutiny
(see, for example, lamarre et al., 2003 for the  xxxg1285xxx  protease inhibitor biln 2061). also for the herpesviruses (i.e.
hsv), new antivirals have been described that target the helicase/primase complex, terminase complex or ul97 protein kinase (eizuru, 2003), and, likewise, new inhibitors are
on the horizon for cmv (de clercq, 2003b) and vzv (de
clercq, 2003d).

8. appraisal of clinical utility
currently licensed antiviral drugs are particularly focussed on the treatment of hiv, hbv, herpesvirus, influenza
virus and hcv infections, and, so are most of forthcoming
antiviral compounds that are in (pre)clinical development.
for the treatment of hiv/aids there are now 19
anti(retro)viral drugs available, and to achieve the largest
possible benefit, these drugs have to be combined in
multiple-drug regimens. numerous drug combinations
could be envisaged. those that have been generally used
consist of two nrtis, or one nrti and one ntrti (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf)), to which is then added
one nnrti or one pi. because of the long-term side effects
(such as lipodystrophy, diabetes and cardiovascular disturbances) associated with the pis that have been longest in
use, there is a tendency for starting anti-hiv therapy with
pi-sparing regimens.
one such regimen that has proven to be quite efficacious
in the treatment of hiv infections, and seems to be well tolerated, is the combination of tdf with 3tc (lamivudine)
and efavirenz. in the future, 3tc may be replaced in this
regimen by (−)ftc (emtricitabine), which could be formulated with tdf in a single pill (to be taken once daily).
combinations of tdf with purine nrtis such as abacavir
or didanosine should be avoided, as these have been shown
not to achieve the expected reductions in viral load. enfuvirtide represents a new dimension in anti-hiv therapy, which
could be added onto any (optimized background) regimen,
but, because of the costs involved and the fact it has to be administered subcutaneously (twice daily), enfuvirtide should
be primarily reserved for salvage therapy.
for the treatment of hbv infections, 2 compounds,
lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil, besides human interferon, are currently available. tdf is recommended for use
in hiv-infected patients who are co-infected with hbv.
whether the treatment of hbv infections should be based
upon multiple-drug regimens (so as to minimize the emergence of virus-drug resistance), as in the case of hiv/aids,
needs to be addressed in future studies. possible dual-drug
regimens that could be envisaged for chronic hepatitis b are
adefovir dipivoxil combined with lamivudine (or emtricitabine).

e. de clercq / journal of clinical virology 30 (2004) 115–133

the treatment of hsv and vzv infections is since many
years fairly well consolidated: it is based on the use of acyclovir, valaciclovir or  xxxd2081xxx , and in some european
countries, also brivudin (bvdu). here, there is no need
for drug combination therapy, as virus-drug resistance has
only rarely proved to be a problem, and, if so (in severely
immunocompromised patients), therapy could be switched
to, for example,  xxxd2157xxx  or cidofovir. the latter two drugs,
which must be administered intravenously, are also used
in the treatment of cmv infections in immunosuppressed
patients, mostly as second choice following the use of
(val)ganciclovir.
for the therapy and prophylaxis of influenza virus infections the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir
have acquired increased momentum (the latter being more
practical as it can be administered orally whereas the former
has to be inhaled). these neuraminidase inhibitors may be
expected to be effective against new influenza virus types
or variants for which no vaccines are available. finally, for
the treatment of hcv infections, the combination of ribavirin with pegylated ifn is the current choice of treatment,
although it provides a durable response in only a varying
percentage of the patients.
