abstract
progesterone (p4) is an essential reproductive steroid hormone required for many aspects of female reproductive physiology. progestins
are compounds that demonstrate progesterone-like activity and are used in oral contraception, hormone therapy, and treatment of some
reproductive disorders, but differ widely in their chemical structures, potency, and pharmacokinetics. while numerous studies have assessed
progestins on specific endpoints, little is known about the activation of global gene expression by progestins. we used affymetrix genechip
u133a expression arrays to examine the action of p4 and six clinically relevant synthetic progestins ( xxxd2067xxx ,  xxxd1946xxx ,
levonorgestrel,  xxxd2554xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx  acetate, and trimegestone) on the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr)-positive t47dco
and the pr-negative t47d-y breast cancer cell lines. excluding  xxxd1946xxx , one or more of the progestins-regulated 329 genes, with 30
genes regulated by at least 2.0-fold by all progestins in the t47dco cells. the synthetic progestins show a high degree of similarity in their
transcriptional responses, and each progestin regulates between 77 and 91% of the genes regulated by p4. independent quantitative rt-pcr
analysis confirmed a similar regulation for s100p, ppl, il20ra, net1,  xxxg212xxx , hig2, and  xxxg560xxx  (sdf-1) by all seven progestins.
attempts to find differentially regulated genes by any progestin compared to all other treatments failed, suggesting any differences are
quantitative, not qualitative. this analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity among these progestins on pr-regulated gene expression
in t47d cells, suggesting a similar and fairly specific mode of action.

progesterone (p4) is a steroid hormone essential for
coordinating normal mammalian reproduction in females
[1–3]. the physiological effects of p4 are mediated by
interaction with progesterone receptors (pr); members
of the nuclear hormone superfamily of ligand-activated

j.d. bray et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 97 (2005) 328–341

transcription factors [4,5]. there are two receptor isoforms,
designated pr-a and pr-b, transcribed from the same gene
by two distinct promoters, with the only difference being that
human pr-b are larger by an additional 164 amino acids at the
amino terminus [6–8]. as a result, pr-a and pr-b have differing transcriptional activities [9–11]. ligand-occupied pr
bind directly to dna at progesterone response elements [12],
and recruit co-regulators that activate or repress transcription via interactions with the general transcription apparatus
[13–16]. pr interact with other transcription factors such
as ap-1 and the rela(p65) subunit of  xxxg1559xxx  [17–19].
they can also interact with src to activate mapk signaling
[20,21], and compete for binding of general transcriptional
machinery components preventing access of other transcriptional activators in a process known as “squelching” [22,23].
pr-dependent transcriptional specificity depends on the pr
isoforms and coregulatory factors available in a target cell
[9,10,24,25]. therefore, transcriptional modulation of pr target genes can occur through a variety of mechanisms that
result in the regulation of gene expression in p4 target tissues.
synthetic progestins are compounds that interact with pr
to activate or repress gene expression in target cells in a
manner presumed to be similar to p4, the natural ligand.
progestins are used in contraception, hormone therapy, and
for treatment of some gynecological disorders. they differ widely in their chemical structure, pharmacokinetics and
potency, as comprehensively reviewed by others [26–28]. the
clinical profile of each progestin differs as well, but all have
the ability to repress e2-induced endometrial proliferation
in vivo [27]. the ability of pr to repress  xxxg730xxx 
function has been demonstrated in vitro as well [9,10,24,29].
therefore, the design of progestins with improved clinical
profiles would benefit from an increased understanding of
the molecular bases for these similarities and differences.
the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation by progestins through pr are poorly characterized, especially with
regard to synthetic progestins. previous expression profiling studies of steroid hormone receptors have focused on
the native hormones [25,30,31], for studying the effects of
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms) [32,33],
assessing a synthetic progestin and a synthetic glucocorticoid
that act through different receptors [34], or compared different chemotypes of pr ligands [35]. no quantitative global
gene regulation analysis has compared multiple synthetic
progestins to p4. the progestin-responsive t47d breast cancer cell line has been used for examining progestin-dependent
gene expression in vitro [25,34,35]. here, we describe the
effects of seven clinically relevant progestins on t47dco
breast cancer cell gene regulation. excluding  xxxd1946xxx ,
we observe very similar pr-dependent activities among these
progestins as assessed by expression profiling. examination
of selected candidate marker genes by quantitative rt-pcr
confirmed these findings. these data suggest that progestins
in general have a similar mechanism of action through pr
in t47d breast cancer cells, and it may be possible to use
transcriptional profiling to predict the progestational activity

of a compound by measuring the transcription of a panel of
marker genes.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture and treatments
pr-positive t47dco [36], and pr-negative t47d-y [37],
human breast carcinoma cells were maintained in mem
supplemented with 5% fbs at 37 ◦ c with 5% co2 . for experiments, cells were plated at ∼70% confluence in mem containing 5% charcoal stripped fbs for 24 h, then were treated
12 h with 1 nm  xxxd1946xxx  (dros),  xxxd2067xxx 
(3-keto), levonorgestrel (lng), medroxyprogesterone
acetate (mpa),  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (neta), trimegestone
(tmg), or 10nm p4 for 12h. p4, 3-keto, lng, mpa, and
neta were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo). the discovery and synthetic chemistry group at
wyeth research synthesized dros. aventis pharmaceuticals (bridgewater, nj) provided tmg. tissue culture media
(emem) was obtained from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). fetal
bovine serum (fbs) was obtained from hyclone (logan,
ut). all other chemicals were purchased from sigma.
2.2. alkaline phosphatase assay
a modified alkaline phosphatase assay was performed
[38–40]. briefly, 25,000 t47dco cells/well were plated in
96-well plates in mem containing 5% charcoal stripped fbs
overnight. the cells were treated with progestins for 15 h.
the medium was removed, washed with phosphate buffered
saline, and then 50 ␮l of 0.1 m tris–hcl, ph 9.8 containing
0.2% triton x-100 were added to each well with 15 min shaking. after this incubation, 150 ␮l of 0.1 m tris–hcl, ph 9.8
containing 4 mm  xxxd2822xxx  was added. vmax
measurements were taken at 5 min intervals for 30 min at
405 nm wavelength using a spectramax plus spectrophotometer (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca) and the data
analyzed to obtain ec50 values using jmp software and activity reported as mod/min (sas institute, inc., cary, nc).
2.3. affymetrix genechip® expression proﬁling
experiments
total rna was prepared using trizol (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and repurified using rneasy columns (qiagen,
valencia, ca). double-stranded cdna was synthesized from
10 ␮g total rna using the superscript system (invitrogen).
briefly, rna was mixed with 100 pmol oligonucleotide 5 ggccatggaattgtaatacgactcactatagggaggcgg-(dt)24 in 20 ␮l water, annealed at 70 ◦ c for 10 min,
and quick-chilled. buffer, dithiothreitol, and dntp mix were
then added and incubated at 37 ◦ c for 2 min. superscript ii
reverse transcriptase was added, and the 50 ◦ c incubation
was continued for 60 min. second-strand synthesis was

solution reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). selected regulated genes identified via genechip® were verified by
real-time quantitative rt-pcr using an abi prism 7900
sequence detection system according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (pe applied biosystems). briefly, taqman primers

performed by adding reaction buffer, dntps (200 ␮m),
dna ligase (10 u), dna polymerase (40 u), ribonuclease
h (2 u), and water (to a final volume of 150 ␮l), and the
reaction was incubated for 2 h at 16 ◦ c. this was followed by
addition of 10 u t4 dna polymerase and incubation at 16 ◦ c
for 5 min. the cdna was purified by phenol/chloroform
extraction, precipitated, and transcribed in vitro using t7
rna polymerase. biotinylated crna was generated using
biotin labeled utp and ctp (perkin-elmer, boston, ma).
the crna was purified by rneasy column (qiagen)
and fragmented by incubation in 40 mm tris–hcl (ph
8.1), 100 mm  xxxd2987xxx , and 30 mm magnesium
acetate buffer at 94 ◦ c for 35 min. fragmented crna were
hybridized to a human u133a genechip® (affymetrix,
santa clara, ca) at 45 ◦ c for 18 h as recommended by the
manufacturer. the hybridized chips were washed and stained
using an affymetrix fluidics station 400 and eukge- xxxg1410xxx 
standard format as recommended by the manufacturer. the
staining was performed using streptavidin–phycoerythrin
conjugate (sape; molecular probes, eugene, or), followed
by biotinylated antibody against streptavidin (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca), and then sape. the chips were
scanned using a hewlett packard genearray scanner and
analyzed using affymetrix mas 5.0 software. raw data for
each array were first normalized to a scaling factor of 100.
hybridization intensities on each array were further normalized to a standard curve created from a set of 11 transcripts
spiked in at defined concentrations. this standard curve was
used to convert signal values for each qualifier gene on each
array to frequency units expressed as parts per million. the
5 /3 ratio for  xxxg861xxx 
( xxxg861xxx ) and for ␤-actin ranged from 0.8 to 1.1. three
independent, time-separated experiments were performed
and analyzed. the statistical analysis was performed using
genesis 2.0 software (genelogic, gaithersburg, md).
pair-wise comparisons on log 10 transformed signal values
were performed for each progestin to vehicle treatments.
unless otherwise stated, genes were determined to be
significantly regulated if the following four conditions were
met; fold difference greater or equal to 1.7, t-test p-values
less then or equal to 0.01, expression level greater than 1.7
signal units and at least one present (p) call.

primers were used at 0.5 ␮m and probes at 0.2 ␮m concentrations in the pcr reactions. quantified rna (2 ␮g) was
converted to cdna using taqman reverse transcription
reagents (pe applied biosystems). gene-specific primers
and probes were used with the taqman universal pcr master mix (pe applied biosystems) to amplify the equivalent
of 50 ng of rna generated from the cdna. reactions were
incubated at 50 ◦ c for 2 min followed by 10 min at 95 ◦ c
then 40 cycles of pcr as follows: 95 ◦ c for 15 s then 60 ◦ c
for 1 min in an abi 7900. the data were analyzed using
sequence detector version 2.0 software (pe applied biosystems) and were normalized to  xxxg861xxx  primer set using a
standard curve method of quantification followed by transformation of values to fold change (pe applied biosystems).
the data were analyzed by one-way anova with huber
weighting to down-weight the effects of outliers and least
square differences using jmp software (sas institute, inc.,
cary, nc).

3. results
3.1. selection of synthetic progestin concentrations for
affymetrix genechip® experiments
alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of progestational
activity in t47d cells [38,39], was used to determine the relative potency of each progestin (fig. 1). with the exception of

fig. 1. effects of p4, dros, 3-keto, lng, mpa, neta, and tmg on
alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity in t47dco cells. t47d cells were
plated at 25,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in emem with 5% charcoal
stripped fetal bovine serum and cultured for 12 h. then, cells were treated
for 12 h with progestins followed by alkaline phosphatase assay as described
in section 2 with results reported as mod/min of enzyme activity over
concentration (in nm) of progestin. the insert lists the ec50 (50% effective
concentration) of steroidal progestins on alkaline phosphatase activity in the
human t47d breast carcinoma cell line in nm. results are the average from
three independent determinations.

dros, all progestins had ec50 of 0.6 nm or less suggesting
that a 1 nm concentration for the synthetic progestins should
give similar, near maximal responses (approximately, ec90 )
and this response should be similar to the response seen with
10 nm p4.
3.2. affymetrix genechip® expression proﬁling
experiments reveal a high degree of similarity among
progestins on gene regulation
we next determined the global effect on transcription
following treatment with either 10 nm of p4 or 1 nm of
the synthetic progestins. global gene regulation was determined using the affymetrix u133a genechip platform,
which monitors over 22,000 transcripts. t47dco cells were
treated with each progestin for 12 h in triplicate, timeseparated experiments to allow for statistical analyses of the
expression profiling data. the selected time point has been
determined empirically to provide consistently high gene
expression on selected known pr-dependent genes ([33] and
data not shown). fig. 2 shows the number of genes regulated by each progestin using the filtering criteria described
in section 2. with the exception of dros, the progestins
regulate between 98 (lng) and 194 (tmg) genes and p4regulated 160 genes. consistent with the alkaline phosphatase
data, with 1 nm dros we see only weak effects on the
transcriptional profile (figs. 1 and 2). we have therefore
excluded dros from detailed comparative analyses. among
all the regulated genes, 72–91% showed an increase in the
transcript levels. in total, the six progestins-regulated 329
genes greater than 1.7-fold (see fig. 2 and supplementary
table s1).
to assess if a progestin differs significantly from any other
progestins, we determined the transcriptional relationship of

fig. 2. number of genes regulated by progestin treatment in t47dco cells.
t47dco cells were plated in emem with 5% charcoal stripped fetal bovine
serum and cultured for 12 h. then, cells were treated for 12 h with 10 nm p4
or 1 nm dros, 3-keto, lng, mpa, neta, and tmg. rna was harvested
and subjected to u133a affymetrix genechip analysis as described in section 2 (>1.7-fold change, p < 0.01). the bars represent the results of three
independent and time-separated experiments. the number of up-regulated
(white bars) and down-regulated (black bars) genes are indicated.

j.d. bray et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 97 (2005) 328–341

with most genes appearing to be regulated unidirectionally by
all progestins. there appear to be two groups of progestins,
with tmg, mpa, and 3-keto showing a more similar magnitude of response than neta, p4, and lng which appear
to group in a similar manner. this is likely due to potency
differences on a single point gene expression measurement.
importantly, no obvious group of genes can be identified
that clearly distinguishes any one treatment from another,
suggesting that there are few quantitative differences among
these progestins.
we also determined the relatedness of each synthetic progestin to the 160 p4-regulated genes from fig. 2. the five
synthetic progestins showed a high degree of overlap and
similarity with 77–91% of p4-regulated genes also regulated
(p < 0.05) by a synthetic progestin. of the 160 p4-regulated
genes, 143 (89%) were regulated by 3-keto, 123 (77%) by
lng, 135 (84%) by mpa, 128 (80%) by neta and 145
(91%) by tmg. (fig. 4, red and dark blue wedges).
this allowed us to define a progestin-regulated gene set
that includes genes regulated by all six progestins. table 2
shows the 30 genes commonly regulated by 2.0-fold by each
of the six progestins. this list includes at least nine genes
(in italics) previously demonstrated to be progesterone upregulated including s100p,  xxxg1085xxx , klf4, net1,  xxxg254xxx ,
atp1b1,  xxxg2339xxx ,  xxxg47xxx  [25], and  xxxg212xxx  [41]. consistent with our analysis showing less similarity among the
down-regulated genes, only 1 gene,  xxxg560xxx  is significantly down-regulated [35]. the number of overlapping
genes increases to 156 if the filter stringency is reduced
(p < 0.05), and includes more down-regulated genes (see
supplementary table s2) suggesting that the observed profiling differences in gene expression are quantitative rather than
qualitative.
3.3. taqman rt-pcr validates the similarity of selected
common progestin-regulated genes

fig. 3. cluster diagram of genes regulated by p4, 3-keto, lng, mpa, neta,
and tmg. fold change values for the 329 genes significantly regulated
by at least one progestin were subjected to hierarchical clustering using
genecluster (eisen). each column represents the average ratio of an individual progestin to vehicle-treated t47dco cells. each row represents one
of the 329 gene qualifiers. only the genes were subjected to hierarchical
clusters, and the order of treatments simply reflects input order. red squares
represent increased expression values relative to vehicle; blue squares represent decreased expression values relative to vehicle control; white squares
represent no difference in expression values compared to vehicle. the color
saturation represents the magnitude of the ratio.

each gene to each progestin. clustering algorithms provide
an unbiased method to group genes with similar expression
to determine underlying patterns. fig. 3 shows the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 329 regulated genes,

to confirm that the expression profiling accurately
described the observed gene regulation by these progestins,
we further analyzed gene expression using taqman quantitative rt-pcr on selected marker genes. single concentration
measurements may miss important concentration-dependent
gene regulation kinetics, so we determined concentration
responses (0.01–1000 nm) for seven commonly regulated
genes: s100p, ppl, il20ra, net1,  xxxg212xxx , hig2, and
 xxxg560xxx  (table 2, in bold).
at the 1 nm concentration (equivalent to the concentration used for array analysis of the synthetic progestins), all
seven selected genes were significantly regulated (p < 0.001)
by the progestins, excluding dros (fig. 5a–g). six of the
seven genes have a greater fold induction magnitude when
measured by taqman than by expression profiling, but still
show a high similarity in regulation. for each gene, there
may be significant expression differences at a single concentration but across the concentration range no progestin
was significantly different from the others. given that the

from fig. 2 (corresponding to 115 up-regulated genes and 45 down-regulated genes), and the common regulation of genes both up- (blue segments) and downregulated (red segments) by each progestin on these genes with corresponding gene numbers. yellow segments and light blue segments represent p4-regulated
genes that do not share up- and down-regulation with the progestin treatment, respectively.

responses for all the genes were highly similar, it is likely
that the treatment concentration selection for array analyses was appropriate for this study. in general, the expression
curves for the synthetic progestins are left-shifted compared
to p4, suggesting that they have higher potencies. for all
seven genes, none of the treatments had a unique expression pattern in a concentration-dependent manner suggesting
a similar mechanism of action by these progestins on prdependent gene expression in t47dco cells.

we also examined dros on these selected marker genes.
if there is a similar mechanism of action for steroidal progestins, then dros should regulate these genes in a similar
manner to the other six progestins. dros does, in fact, regulate all genes tested but with reduced potency and efficacy
(fig. 5a–g). we observe significant gene regulation following 10 nm or higher dros treatment, which indicates that
the concentration of dros selected for the array analysis
was too low.

italicized genes have previously been described as progestin-regulated in t47d cells. fold change is progestin treatment compared to vehicle control. asterisk
(*) denotes genes represented multiple times because the gene is represented multiple times on the array. bold genes have been validated independently by
taqman© .

3.4. expression proﬁling analysis to ﬁnd differentially
regulated genes by a single progestin
only a single gene, f3, was identified that appeared to be
uniquely regulated by a single treatment, 3-keto (p < 0.01 and
>1.7-fold change). we next attempted to identify additional
genes showing a significant qualitative difference among progestins. since the response to progestin treatment was similar
and individual progestins do not regulate a distinct set of
genes, we chose to increase the statistical analysis power by
combining the data derived from multiple treatments. this
also allowed us to systematically identify genes that are significantly regulated by a single progestin. we compared the
expression of a single progestin to the mean expression values
derived from the other five progestins. this analysis identified
84 unique genes with the potential to demonstrate quantitative differential regulation by any one progestin (table 3). for
most of the treatments, only a few (between 1 and 16) of gene
qualifiers showed progestin specific regulation. however, at
least 33 transcripts were differentially regulated following
treatment with neta. it is important to note that the difference in expression levels is generally subtle and usually less

than 2.0-fold. among these genes, only f3, hpcal1, and
 xxxg740xxx  have been previously identified as progestin-regulated
[25,42]; 3-keto differentially regulated f3 compared to the
other progestins, and p4 differentially regulated hpcal1 and
 xxxg740xxx . for most genes in this subset, the observed relative
expression differences suggest only subtle qualitative differences distinguish the progestins (supplementary table s3).
most of these genes show differential regulation of less than

differentially regulated by one progestin compared to the

nevertheless, quantitative rt-pcr was performed on
seven genes that were potentially progestin-specific by

expression profiling (table 3 and supplementary table s3).
f3 (3-keto-selective), maz, adam15, and hpcal1 (p4selective), hmgcs2 (lng-selective), cri1 and  xxxg1150xxx 
(neta-selective) were chosen as candidates. they were
selected because of a relatively large fold-induction as
seen by expression analysis, lack of potential cross
hybridization, previous identification as progestin-regulated,
or possible relevance to known gene products and/or pathways.

experiments.

for f3, we predicted to see a 3-keto selective response.
while 3-keto is the most potent inducer at all concentrations,
it is not significantly different from the other progestins at
any concentration (fig. 6a). hpcal1 showed a progestindependent response, but was not selective for p4 (fig. 6b).
none of the remaining genes show the expected pattern of
progestin selective expression (fig. 6c–g). in fact, some of

the genes (maz, hmgcs2, cri1, and  xxxg1150xxx ) showed no
concentration-dependent regulation by qualitative rt-pcr.
since many of these genes are differentially expressed less
than 2.0-fold by expression analysis or had low expression
levels, it is not surprising that they did not confirm by quantitative pcr. we detected no qualitative differences among
these progestins on t47dco cell gene expression.

“any” is the total of unique genes from all the treatments. from the 329
genes regulated by any progestin in t47dco cells, only a single gene was
regulated in the t47d-y cells.

3.6. progestin gene regulation in pr negative cells
to determine if any transcriptional responses were mediated through non-pr mediated pathways, expression profiling was performed using t47d-y cells, a pr-negative subline
of t47d cells. of the 329 progestin-regulated genes, only
1 gene (gpcr41) is significantly regulated (1.9-fold) in the
null cells and by only a single progestin (mpa). this suggests
that the transcriptional regulation by progestins in t47dco
cells is predominantly mediated through pr. however, we
identified additional genes regulated in the null cells that were
not regulated in wild type cells (table 4, and supplementary
table s4). in total, only a small fraction, 83 genes, are regulated by any progestin in the t47d-y cells. many of the genes
are very highly expressed (i.e., ribosomal and cytoskeletal
genes) and may be artifactual due to differential chip saturation. preliminary quantitative pcr on some of the ribosomal
genes suggests this to be the case (data not shown). further
confirmation and investigation of these genes is necessary,
but beyond the scope of this study.

4. discussion
expression profiling was used to investigate the effects of
seven clinically relevant progestins (p4, dros, 3-keto, lng,
mpa, neta, and tmg) on pr-dependent gene expression
in the t47dco breast cancer cell line, a well-characterized

337

model for progestational activity. the results show that for
each progestin, as well as all the progestins, more genes are
up-regulated than down-regulated, and more genes are commonly up-regulated than commonly down-regulated between
p4 and the synthetic progestins (figs. 2–4). we also show
that, with the exception of dros, there are no significant
qualitative differences with regard to gene regulation through
pr. there are quantitative differences on gene expression
and any given pair of progestins may differ quantitatively
from another on a given gene. nonetheless, the similarity
of gene regulation is quite striking. in retrospect, this is not
surprising since progestins were selected by their ability to
have similar effects on defined physiological endpoints, consistent with the desired clinical goals as “progestational”
compounds. we observed good concordance between array
analysis and rt-pcr. seven marker genes also confirm that
no progestin (except dros) is significantly different from the
others, suggesting that a similar mechanism of pr-dependent
gene regulation is utilized by all of these progestins.
the degree of similarity in the transcriptional response
through pr was striking since the rationale used to select
these seven progestins was meant to investigate a range of differing progestins, with known differences in steroid receptor
selectivity and activities. we used availability for therapeutic
use as the primary selection criterion. from this, we chose
representative progestins from different chemical classes
with varying steroid selectivity profiles and potencies. p4, the
only natural ligand for pr, was selected as the reference agonist. the synthetic progestins have differences in biological
activity and are generally more potent than p4 in bioassays that assess pregnancy maintenance, ovulation inhibition
or general progestational effects on the rabbit endometrium
[26,27]. the biological activities of the progestins used are
summarized in table 5 [26,27,43]. there are two major chemical classes of synthetic progestin: the first class containing
mpa and tmg is structurally related to progesterone. mpa is
a 17␣- xxxd2303xxx  derivative called a pregnane and
tmg is a 19-norprogesterone derivative (norpregnane). the
second class consisting of neta, lng and 3-keto are structurally related to testosterone. neta is a 19-nortestoterone
derivative called an estrane. lng and 3-keto (the active form
of its prodrug,  xxxd1849xxx ) are 13-ethylgonanes (gonanes).
pharmacokinetic and metabolic differences exist but are
beyond the scope of this study.

it is noteworthy that the synthetic progestins have known
differences in steroid receptor selectivity and activities (see
table 5). however, the low degree of qualitative differences
among these progestins through pr suggests that there is
minimal contribution from cross-reactivity with other steroid
receptor on gene expression in the t47dco cells. indeed,
ghatge et al. (personal communication) have shown a lack
of androgenic activity, and weak glucocorticoid activity in
these cells. furthermore, the lack of substantial consistent
gene regulation in the pr-negative t47d-y cells implies that
at the dose used, the signaling is occurring through pr, not
other receptors.
we find that each gene has a slightly different concentration response. however, at the concentrations used for array
analysis the response of each progestin across each gene is
fairly similar suggesting that our selection of progestin concentrations was valid. the rt-pcr results suggest that if we
were to examine genes regulated by progestins at a lower concentration we would see more quantitative differences, but
still observe the same overall trend. in general, the expression
curves for the synthetic progestins are left-shifted compared
to p4, suggesting they have higher potencies, consistent with
the alkaline phosphatase assay data and historical biological
data (figs. 1 and 5). however, the efficacies of the progestins
appear to be very similar.
we were unable to identify any gene that, for discriminatory purposes, is selectively regulated by a single progestin.
we attempted to identify any gene that is differentially regulated by any single progestin, and have identified ∼80
potential candidates. however, these differences were not
confirmed for seven selected genes by rt-pcr.
of the seven progestins, dros had the greatest differences on gene expression. dros is an analogue of
spirolonolactone structurally related to testosterone and has
biochemical and pharmacological properties similar to progesterone such as antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid
activities [44]. dros regulated fewer genes at 1 nm than
the other progestins, and dros also was the least potent
ligand on alkaline phosphatase activity (figs. 1 and 2).
these results are consistent with dros being a less potent
progestin in t47d cells and provided justification to exclude
it from the analysis. we did observe that dros regulates
all the marker genes examined in this study (figs. 5 and 6);
again suggesting that dros is simply less potent. these data
suggest that the gene expression measurements can provide
an accurate and sensitive way to assess pharmacological
parameters of a progestin such as potency or efficacy.
we have confirmed and extended the expression data for
t47d cells. our results are consistent with previous studies
of gene expression in t47dco cells that show there are more
up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes by p4 [25,35].
this study shows that there are more similarities than there
are differences among progestins. previous examination of
t47d gene expression comparing p4 with the antiprogestin,
ru486, or a non-steroidal pr modulator (prm) with mixed
activities demonstrated that these classes can be discerned

from each other [35]. treatment of t47d cells with r5020,
a synthetic progestin, or dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid,
yielded overlapping but distinct regulated gene sets [34],
whereas we see a very high degree of similarity. there is little
difference upon global gene regulation by these progestins,
indicating that all these hormones fall into the same class
when both pr isoforms are present. we have identified a significant number of genes previously described to be regulated
in the t47d isoform-specific lines (see text [25,45]). expression profiling and further experimentation with these cells,
after treatment with the seven progestins, has been initiated
to determine the contribution of pr isoforms to progestinspecific gene regulation.
the regulated genes confirm and extend our knowledge
of progestational activity on cells. many of the regulated
genes encode cell surface proteins suggesting that progestins
may alter the phenotype of the cells to be more secretory
than proliferative. this is consistent with the upregulation of
alkaline phosphatase activity and previous findings [25,39].
ppl encodes the intermediate filament protein periplakin,
a component of desmosomes [46].  xxxg212xxx  encodes the
catalytic subunit of the ouabain-sensitive na+ , k+ atpase
pump [47,48]. net1 encodes a guanine exchange factor
for rhoa [49,50]. rhoa is a gtpase important for actin
cytoskeletal functions and has a role as a key regulator of
cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion [51]. more intriguing,
the na+ , k+ atpase pump is involved in tight junction formation through rho gtpase and stress fibers [52]. adam15
(named for a disintegrin and metalloprotease 15, metargidin)
encodes a membrane-anchored glycoprotein that has been
implicated in cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions and in the
proteolysis of molecules on the cell surface or extracellular
matrix [53]. p4 is known to regulate other members of this
protease family such as adamts-1 [54]. s100p, the highest
regulated gene, encodes a calcium-binding protein associated
with breast cancer [55,56], and has been previously identified
as a progesterone-regulated gene in t47d cells [25]. hig2
is a hypoxia-induced gene of unknown function [57]. however, genes involved in proliferation or proliferative responses
are also progestin-regulated. the il20ra gene encodes the
 xxxg216xxx  of the il-20 receptor, which transduces il20 signaling via jak-stat pathways [58,59]. maz encodes
a myc-associated zing finger protein that can function as
a purine-binding transcription factor [60]. the lone downregulated gene,  xxxg560xxx , a growth stimulatory cytokine (also
called  xxxg560xxx ) is estrogen-induced in
mcf-7 breast cancer cells [61], and down-regulated by p4
and ru486 in t47d cells [35]. hpcal1 encodes a calcium
binding protein previously identified as both pr-a and pr-b
regulated gene in t47d cells [25,62]. f3 has been identified
as pr-b selective in t47d cells, and pr-regulated in vivo and
in vitro in endometrial stromal cells [25,42,63,64]. hmgcs2
encodes mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa
synthase involved in ketogenesis [65,66]. cri1 encodes a
protein that inhibits histone acetylation activity of p300 or the
 xxxg516xxx , cbp [67]. finally,  xxxg1150xxx  encodes

j.d. bray et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 97 (2005) 328–341

an essential regulator of physiological processes in bone, kidney, and mammary gland [68]. preliminary examination of
two other genes from table 2,  xxxg1085xxx  and  xxxg1470xxx  also
show the same pattern of similar progestin regulation (data
not shown). while these genes have different physiological
roles, the observed regulation by progestins is remarkably
alike.
in sum, we have established an endogenous progestinregulated gene profile (table 2) that may predict the progestational activity of a molecule more accurately than assays
that use exogenous reporters and/or transfected pr. of future
interest would be how other classes of pr modulators such as
partial pr agonists, pr antagonists, nonsteroidal progestins,
or dissociated progestins would regulate these genes. as new
generations of prms are developed, these genes may provide
insight into the mechanisms of action of novel molecules and
ultimately which genes are responsible for various aspects of
progestin-dependent physiology.
