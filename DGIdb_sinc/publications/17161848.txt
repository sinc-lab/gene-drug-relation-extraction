abstract
 xxxd3417xxx  (atra), the primary active metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx , was examined for its antiestrogenic activity in rats using an in vivo
uterotrophic assay. all rats were ovariectomized 2 weeks prior to receiving 5 mg/kg/day atra or 0.3 mug/kg/day  xxxd2054xxx  (ee)
subcutaneously once a day for 3 consecutive days. rats were sacrificed 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 h after the last treatment. ee increased uterine weight and
the coinjection of atra with ee significantly suppressed this effect 3 and 24 h after treatment. mrna expression was examined during this 24-h
period and the mrna expression levels of  xxxg730xxx  alpha (er alpha),  xxxg1932xxx  (rar beta),  xxxg2000xxx  (rxr gamma) and
 xxxg1938xxx  ( xxxg1938xxx  i) were found to have significantly increased in the atra + ee group compared with those in the ee
group. this is the first report on the antiestrogenic activity of atra determined using an in vivo adult rat uterotrophic assay. the up-regulation of
rar or rxr mrna expression level was probably responsible for the antiestrogenic activity of atra.

introduction
 xxxd3105xxx  and its retinoid derivatives have profound effects
on cellular proliferation and differentiation (sporn and roberts,
1983).  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) is the primary active
metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx  (vermot et al., 2000; zheng et al., 1999)
that is also a biologically active retinoid (mccormick and
napoli, 1982).
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) are members of the steroid/
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  family that include the nuclear
receptors for estrogen (evans, 1998). most biological effects
of atra are mediated through nuclear rars, which are
ligand-inducible transcription factors (noy, 2000). there are
several types of rar including alpha, beta and gamma subtypes, which
have affinity for atra and 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx , and alpha, beta and gamma
subtypes of the retinoid x receptors (rxrs), which have
affinity for only 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  (allenby et al., 1993;
stunnenberg, 1993). retinoid x receptors have been shown to

be heterodimerization partners for rars (valcarcel et al., 1994,
1997).
the transport and distribution of  xxxd3105xxx  are mediated by a
group of specific binding proteins. for example, retinoid
binding protein (rbp) transports retinol from the liver to
various target cells via the circulation. cellular retinol-binding
proteins (crbps) and cellular retinoic-acid-binding proteins
(crabps) prevent the absorption of  xxxd3105xxx  into the cell
membrane and the delivery of  xxxd3105xxx  within the cell by
affecting the availability of retinoids to retinoid-metabolizing
enzymes (noy, 2000).
estrogen plays a role in producing uterine metaplasia in vitamin
a-deficient rats (bo and smith, 1966), and atra supplementation prevents squamous cell metaplasia in both ovariectomized
and intact mice (ponnamperuma et al., 1999). estrogen and
 xxxd3105xxx  affect rodent reproductive organ metaplasia (bo and
smith, 1966; jetten et al., 1996; ponnamperuma et al., 1999).
previous reports showed that atra inhibits the estrogeninduced proliferation of several cell types using an in vitro assay
(fontana et al., 1990; muller et al., 2002). all-trans-retinoic
acid inhibits the estrogen-induced proliferation of uterine
stromal and myometrial cells (boettger-tong and stancel,

1995). in addition, atra has receptor-mediated antiestrogenic
activity and interferes with estrogenic action at the estrogen
responsive element (ere) level (demirpence et al., 1994;
takeyoshi et al., 2002).
 xxxd3417xxx  has an antiestrogenic effect in in vitro
assays (fontana et al., 1990; muller et al., 2002). on the other hand,
only a few studies of the in vivo antiestrogenic effect of atra have
been reported (masui et al., 2001; takeyoshi et al., 2002). we
examined the inhibitory effect of atra by a standard in vivo
uterotrophic assay using adult rats that was described by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd)
(kanno et al., 2001). we showed that atra inhibited ethynyl
estradiol (ee)-induced uterotrophic activity. in addition, atra +
ee coinjection up-regulated the mrna expression levels of rar
beta and rxr gamma, and recovered the decreased levels of er alpha and
crabp i mrna expressions by  xxxd2054xxx  treatment.

primer (table 1). pcr was performed by denaturation at 95 °c for
1 min, annealing for 1 min and extension at 72 °c for 1 min with
various numbers of pcr cycles (er alpha and  xxxg53xxx : 30 cycles; and
 xxxg1931xxx , rar beta, rxr alpha, rxr gamma,  xxxg1938xxx  i, crabp i and crabp

each primer (table 1). the sequences of the forward and reverse
primers are shown in table 1. the pcr products of each sample
were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel, followed by staining with
ethidium bromide and visualization under uv illumination. the
bands were quantified using densimetry (chemi genius2,
syngene). the intensities of the target signals were normalized
to that of the  xxxg53xxx  internal control. the expected sizes of the pcr
products were 344 bp for er alpha, 397 bp for  xxxg1931xxx , 470 bp for rar

230 bp for crabp i, 227 bp for crabp ii and 665 bp for  xxxg53xxx 
(table 1). we used a 100-bp dna ladder for molecular weight
marker (takara bio inc., shiga, japan).
statistical analysis
treatment-related effects on wet and blotted uterine weight/
b.w. and the alteration of mrna expression level were assessed
using the unpaired t-test. the level of significance was selected
as p b 0.05.
results
uterine weight
the mean blotted uterine weight/b.w. values were significantly higher in the ee group than in the atra + ee group 3
(65.6 mg/100 g b.w. vs 49.8 mg/100 g b.w., respectively) and 24
(81.5 mg/100 g b.w. vs 71.1 mg/100 g b.w., respectively) h after
the last injection (fig. 1). similar results were also shown for
wet uterine weight/b.w. (data in not shown).
rt-pcr
the mrna expression levels in the ee group were significantly lower than those in the atra + ee group for er alpha (0.290
vs 0.473, p b 0.001), rxr gamma (0.063 vs 0.145, p b 0.001) and
 xxxg1938xxx  i (0.249 vs 0.641, p b 0.001) 24 h after the last injection, as
shown in fig. 2 (a, c and d). in contrast, the mrna expression
level of rar beta increased by the coinjection of atra with ee
compared with that in the case of the ee group 3 (0.209 vs 0.062,
p b 0.001), 6 (0.221 vs 0.108, p b 0.0512), 12 (0.147 vs 0.066,
p b 0.05) and 24 (0.273 vs 0.192, p b 0.05) h after the last injection, as shown in fig. 2 (b).
discussion
we showed here that coinjection of atra with ee significantly prevents the ee-induced increases in uterine weight 3 and
24 h after the injection of the drugs. to our knowledge, this is the
first report indicating that atra inhibits the ee-induced uterine
weight increase in adult animals. we also showed that the mrna
expression levels of er alpha, rxr gamma, and  xxxg1938xxx  i 24 h after the last

injection were up-regulated by atra + ee coinjection. as for
rar beta, atra + ee coinjection up-regulated its mrna
expression level 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after the last injection.
 xxxd3417xxx  has antiestrogenic activity in the er
alpha-positive breast cancer cell line mcf-7 (demirpence et al.,
1994; fontana et al., 1990; muller et al., 2002), and uterine
stromal and myometrial cells, but has no activity in epithelium
cells (boettger-tong and stancel, 1995). on the other hand,
only a few studies of the in vivo antiestrogenic activity of atra
have been reported (masui et al., 2001; takeyoshi et al., 2002).
we studied the effects of atra on ee-induced uterine
weight 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 h after the last injection using uterotrophic
assay. the oecd test guideline showed four types of
uterotrophic assay protocols. all protocols developed had
essentially the same design and differed only in the model used
for the route of administration. the protocols use the immature
female rat or ovariectomized rat model, with the administration
of doses by oral gavage or subcutaneous injection for 3 or
7 days at 24-hour intervals followed by sacrifice 24 h after the
last injection. with either pattern, animals are killed 24 h after
the last injection. we tried to determine the change in uterine
weight within 24 h after the last injection.
demirpence et al. (1994) have studied the inhibitory effect of
atra on ps2 mrna level using mcf-7 cells 3, 6, 12, and 24 h
after cotreatment with ee, and suggested that atra decreases
ee-induced ps2 mrna level 3, 12 and 24 h after infection
(demirpence et al., 1994). ps2 is a single endogenous gene
transcriptionally controlled by er. the expression times of the
antiestrogen activity of atra approximately correspond to our
present in vivo results except for 12 h after the last injection.
the discrepancy observed here might be due to the difference
between in vitro and in vivo studies.
because atra does not have er binding affinity
(takeyoshi et al., 2002), it exerts its antiestrogenic effect
without interfering with the receptor–ligand interaction. this
effect may be caused by interference with estrogenic activity at
the ere level (takeyoshi et al., 2002). the antiestrogenic
activity of atra was markedly increased by adding rar
combined with rxr, indicating that rar and rxr can
interfere with er at the ere level (demirpence et al., 1994).
retinoids that activate the rar beta or rxr pathway
preferentially cause a decrease in the amount of the protein
 xxxg366xxx  and a corresponding decrease in the growth rate of
bronchial epithelium cells (boyle et al., 1999). in this study, we
demonstrated the antiestrogenic activity of atra, and the
overexpression mrnas of rar beta and rxr gamma using an in vivo
assay. the antiestrogenic effect of atra might be expressed
through rar beta or rxr gamma pathways.
the mrna expression levels of er alpha and  xxxg1938xxx  i in the ee
group were down-regulated 24 h after the last injection, as in
previous reports (medlock et al., 1991; mohamed and abdelrahman, 2000; murata et al., 2003; tannous-khuri et al., 1994;
zhou et al., 1995). the present results showed that atra + ee
coinjection rescued the decreased levels of er alpha and crabp i
mrna expressions by ee treatment, namely, atra might
inhibit the negative feedback of er alpha and  xxxg1938xxx  i mrna
expressions caused by ee administration.

steroids and retinoids control the differentiation of reproductive epithelia in female organs; estrogen maintains the
squamous differentiation of vaginal and ectocervical epithelia,
whereas  xxxd3417xxx  maintains the simple columnar endocervical and uterine epithelia. the absence of dietary retinoids
transforms the epithelial lining of the uterus from simple
columnar to squamous keratinizing cells in both ovariectomized
and intact mice, and atra supplementation prevents squamous
metaplasia in both ovariectomized and intact mice (ponnamperuma et al., 1999).  xxxd3417xxx  might have an
inhibitory effect on ee-induced uterine weight by interfering
with the ee-induced stratification of the squamous epithelium.
conclusions
we showed the antiestrogenic activity of atra using an in
vivo assay and proposed mechanisms of this action, namely,
rar or rxr actions on ere. however, further study is
necessary to investigate these mechanisms.
