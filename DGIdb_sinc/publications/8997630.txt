abstract
 xxxd2330xxx  žhp 873; 1-w4-w3-w4-ž6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl.-1-piperidinylxpropoxyx-3-methoxyphenylxethanone. is a compound
currently in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia.  xxxd2330xxx  displays affinity for dopamine d 2 receptors and for 5-ht2a
receptors and has a variety of in vivo activities suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic. here we present an examination of the affinity of
 xxxd2330xxx  to a variety of human and rat homologs of dopamine and 5-ht receptor subtypes. we employed receptor binding assays using
membranes from cells stably expressing human dopamine d1, d 2s , d 2l , d 3 , d4 and d5 and 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors and rat  xxxg1119xxx 
and 5-ht7 receptors.  xxxd2330xxx  displayed higher affinity for the dopamine d 3 receptor ž k i s 7.1 nm. than for the dopamine d4
receptor ž k i s 25 nm..  xxxd2330xxx  displayed high affinity for the  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors ž k i s 42.7 and 21.6 nm, respectively., and
was found to have higher affinity for the 5-ht2a ž k i s 5.6 nm. than for the  xxxg1115xxx  ž k i s 42.8 nm.. the potential implications
of this receptor binding profile are discussed in comparison with data for other antipsychotic compounds.

1. introduction
 xxxd2330xxx  žhp 873; 1-w4-w3-w4-ž6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl.-1-piperidinylxpropoxyx-3-methoxyphenylxethanone. is a new atypical antipsychotic agent currently
in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia žborison et al., 1995.. it was selected for development based on
its affinity for rat dopamine d 2 and 5-ht2 receptors and
on its favorable profile in a variety of other biochemical
and behavioral tests žcorbett et al., 1993; strupczewski et
al., 1995; szewczak et al., 1995; szczepanik et al., 1996..
schizophrenia is a serious, chronic, psychiatric disease
affecting approximately 1% of the world’s population and
having profound effects, personally and financially, on
patients and their families. a person with schizophrenia
suffers from symptoms broadly categorized as ‘positive’,
‘negative’ and ‘cognitive’. positive symptoms include
delusions, hallucinations and disorganization of thought.
negative or deficit symptoms include social withdrawal,
impairment in role functioning, flat affect, poverty of
speech, marked lack of initiative or energy, and inability to

experience pleasure. cognitive symptoms comprise impairments in attention, verbal fluency, recall memory and
executive function. these symptoms make it extremely
difficult for the schizophrenic patient to function normally
within society.
since the correlation between antagonism of dopamine
receptors, specifically of the d 2 subtype, and clinical
antipsychotic activity against positive symptoms was made
žsee creese et al., 1978., a large number of agents with
varied chemical structures have been created and are used
in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.
these agents have varying degrees of clinical efficacy
against positive symptoms of schizophrenia and this efficacy is correlated with antagonism of dopamine d 2 receptors in mesolimbicrmesocortical brain regions žsee, for
example, davis et al., 1991.. in contrast, antagonism of
dopamine d 2 receptors in the corpus striatum is correlated
with acute parkinson-like extrapyramidal symptoms, notably dystonia žinvoluntary muscle spasms., pseudoparkinsonism žtremor and rigidity. and akathisia žrestlessness.. following long-term chronic treatment with these
agents, there is a risk of developing tardive dyskinesia žfor
review, see baldessarini, 1996.. thus, most of the currently available antipsychotic agents, while effective, are
associated with a high incidence of extrapyramidal symp-

toms, leading to low patient compliance and high
relapserrehospitalization rates.
recently, it has been suggested that agents which antagonize 5-ht2 receptors in the brain, along with dopamine
d 2 receptors, may have an improved ratio of therapeutic
effect to extrapyramidal symptoms žsee bersani et al.,
1986; stockmeier et al., 1993.. examples of such compounds are clozapine and risperidone. the property of
antagonizing both dopamine d 2 and 5-ht2 receptors may
contribute to reduced extrapyramidal symptom liability of
these compounds at doses that effectively treat
schizophrenic symptoms žjanssen et al., 1988; leysen et
al., 1988; meltzer, 1989.. a number of other agents with
this mechanism of action are in varying stages of development. of note among these are olanzapine and seroquel,
which are structural analogs of clozapine žbymaster et al.,
1996; saller and salama, 1993.. widespread use of clozapine has been limited by the significant žapproximately 1%.
incidence of agranulocytosis.
the application of molecular biological tools has enabled the cloning and expression of a number of novel
dopamine and serotonin receptors žsee jarvie and caron,
1993; hoyer et al., 1994.. the functions of these receptors
are currently being intensively explored. of note among
these studies is the differing affinity for dopamine d 2-like
receptors žd 3 and d4 . that may explain some of the
variability in efficacy seen among known antipsychotic
agents žsee, for example, schwartz et al., 1992.. additionally, affinity for  xxxg1119xxx  receptors may be associated with
reduced propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms žroth et
al., 1994. and affinity for 5-ht2c receptors may be responsible for neuroleptic-induced weight gain. transgenic
mice in which the expression of the 5-ht2c has been
blocked are obese žtecott et al., 1995. suggesting that
inhibiting this receptor with a drug may produce weight
gain.
we report here investigations on the affinity of  xxxd2330xxx  and selected other antipsychotic agents for cloned
dopamine and  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes. we discuss
these results with special reference to known or suspected
functions of these receptors and, based on these results and
suspected functions, make conclusions for clinical efficacy
and side effect liability of  xxxd2330xxx .

2. materials and methods
2.1. receptor cloning and expression
2.1.1. dopamine d1 and d5 receptors
the human dopamine d 1 and d5 cdnas were obtained
from the laboratory of dr. marc caron in the vector
pcmv5. the coding regions of the human d 1 and d5
receptors were subcloned into pmmlv žsandrasagra et al.,
unpublished. and prcrrsv žinvitrogen., respectively.
chinese hamster ovary žcho. cells were then transfected

with these constructs and  xxxd2191xxx  žg418.-resistant clones
were isolated. clonal cell lines expressing high levels of
the receptors žas determined by mrna and receptor binding data. were chosen and characterized pharmacologically.
2.1.2. dopamine d2s and d2 l receptors
the dopamine d 2 receptor gene was isolated from a
human striatal žcaudaterputamen. cdna library; short and
long splice variants, d 2s and d 2l , were sequenced and
sub-cloned into the expression vector prcrrsv žinvitrogen.. cho cells were stably transfected and  xxxg418xxx  resistant
clones were isolated. using mrna and binding data,
single high expressing clones were identified, and these
clones were pharmacologically characterized.
2.1.3. dopamine d3 and d4 receptors
membranes from ccl1.3 cells stably expressing the
human dopamine d 3 receptor were obtained from research biochemicals international žnatick, ma, usa..
membranes from cho cells stably expressing the human
 xxxg658xxx  žd4.7 isoform. were obtained from
dr. j. baumgold žreceptor biology, baltimore, md, usa..
2.1.4. 5-ht2 a and 5-ht2 c receptors
the 5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  genes were isolated
from human substantia nigra and human cerebral cortex
libraries, respectively. each gene was sequenced and subcloned into the expression vector prcrrsv žinvitrogen..
baby hamster kidney žbhk. and cho cells were stably
transfected with the 5-ht2a and 5ht2c receptor cdnas,
respectively, and  xxxg418xxx  resistant clones were isolated.
clones expressing high levels of the receptors žas determined by mrna and receptor binding data. were chosen
and pharmacologically characterized.
2.1.5. serotonin  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors
membranes from cho cells stably expressing the rat
 xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptor were obtained from dr. j.
baumgold žreceptor biology, baltimore, md, usa..
2.2. cell culture conditions
2.2.1. adherent cultures
adherent cho cultures were grown in 150 mm plates
or roller bottles using the following medium: ham’s f-12
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 mgrml  xxxg418xxx  and
penicillin-streptomycin ž100 urml and 100 mgrml.. cells
were grown to confluence and were harvested by mechanical scraping.
2.2.2. suspension cultures
suspension cultures were employed for cho cells expressing dopamine d 1 and d 2l receptors. cells were
initially grown on plates and were transferred to suspension culture at 300 000 cellsrml in medium containing

s. kongsamut et al.r european journal of pharmacology 317 (1996) 417–423

50% cho-sfm-ii, 50% ham’s f-12 containing 10% fetal
bovine serum žfinal conc. 5%., 400 mgrml  xxxg418xxx  and
penicillinrstreptomycin ž100 urml and 100 mgrml; all
from gibco.. growth was monitored and cell viability was
assessed using trypan blue exclusion. viable cell density
was maintained at between 300 000 and 600 000 cellsrml,
and serum was gradually withdrawn by reducing the percentage of ham’s f-12 containing fetal bovine serum.
2.3. membrane preparation
cells from both adherent and suspension were harvested
into 250 ml centrifuge tubes and spun down at 1200 = g.
the medium was removed, cells were then washed with
100 ml phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in water,
and homogenized with a polytron on ice at a medium
setting. the homogenate was spun down and resuspended
in distilled water in order to reduce clumping and to
maintain the homogenate as membrane fragments. following protein determination, the membrane homogenate was
diluted with 10%  xxxd1896xxx  and stored in cryogenic vials at y808c until used.
2.4. protein determination
for determination of membrane protein, the membrane
suspension was diluted 1:1 with 1%  xxxd3215xxx , vortexed and allowed to stand for 5 min. this solubilized protein was measured using the biorad dc protein
determination kit žcatalog no. 500-0112.. protein concentrations were calculated by linear regression and interpolation based on a standard curve using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.

100% inhibition, respectively. the percent inhibition at
each drug concentration was the average of duplicate
determinations. except where indicated, each determination was performed 2–5 times.

 xxxd2330xxx  showed somewhat greater affinity for dopamine
d 2 over d4 receptors ž k i ratios d4rd 2 s 3.3 and 3.5,
respectively.. unlike other compounds,  xxxd2330xxx  showed
higher affinity for dopamine d 3 receptors over d4 receptors.

3. results

3.3. d2 r 5-ht2 ratios

results are presented in table 2. highlights from the
table are summarized below.

the rat d 2r5-ht2 ratio of k i values was 17.4 for
 xxxd2330xxx , 12.9 for clozapine and 14.3 for risperidone.
for the other compounds, this ratio was less than 10; for
haloperidol, the ratio was 0.3. when examined in human
receptors, the human d 2l r5-ht2a ratio of k i values was
12.5 for clozapine, 1.1 for  xxxd2330xxx , 2.45 for risperidone, 1.6 for olanzapine, 1.1 for seroquel and 0.012 for
haloperidol.

3.1. affinity for dopamine d1 and d5 receptors
 xxxd2330xxx  had low affinity ž k i values in the 10y7 m
range. for dopamine d 1 and d5 receptors žrat and human..
we found most antipsychotic compounds to have low
affinity žhigh k i values. for dopamine d 1 and d5 receptors relative to their affinity for dopamine d 2 receptors.
exceptions to this are the tricyclic compounds, clozapine,
olanzapine and seroquel, which had affinities for dopamine
d 1 receptors in the same range žwithin 2-fold. as their
affinities for dopamine d 2 receptors. this was seen with
data for both rat and human receptors. affinity for
dopamine d5 receptors was roughly equal to that for
dopamine d 1 receptors.

3.4. binding to 5-ht2 a and 5-ht2 c receptors
with the exception of seroquel and haloperidol, the
compounds showed high affinity for the human 5-ht2a
receptor.  xxxd2330xxx  and risperidone showed 7.6- and
11-fold selectivity for 5-ht2a over 5-ht2c receptors, respectively. clozapine and olanzapine showed 2.2- and
3.8-fold selectivity for 5-ht2c over 5-ht2a receptors,
respectively.

3.2. affinity for dopamine d2-like receptors

3.5. binding to  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors

in general, affinities for human dopamine d 2 receptors
were found to be higher than those for rat dopamine d 2
receptors. there was no difference between affinity for
dopamine d 2s and d 2l receptors. clozapine showed selectivity for dopamine d4 receptors over dopamine d 2 receptors. olanzapine, seroquel and haloperidol each showed
similar affinities for dopamine d 2 , d 3 and d4 receptors

 xxxd2330xxx  and clozapine showed high affinity for  xxxg1112xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors. risperidone, seroquel and
haloperidol had k i values for binding to  xxxg1119xxx  receptors
of greater than 1000 nm. risperidone had sub-nanomolar
affinity for the 5-ht7 receptor. k i values for olanzapine,
seroquel and haloperidol at 5-ht7 receptors were greater
than 100 nm.

4. discussion
 xxxd2330xxx  was selected as an atypical antipsychotic
compound based in part on its affinity for rat dopamine d 2
and 5-ht2 receptors. in the current work,  xxxd2330xxx 
exhibited high affinity for human dopamine d 2 and d 3
and for 5-ht2a receptors.  xxxd2330xxx  also exhibited high
affinity for dopamine d4 , and for 5-ht2c ,  xxxg1119xxx  and
5-ht7 receptors. however,  xxxd2330xxx  displayed low
affinity for dopamine d 1 and d5 receptors. this receptor
binding profile may predict pharmacological activities discussed below.
4.1. affinity for dopamine d2 receptors and clinical potency
 xxxd2330xxx  is among the most potent antipsychotic
compounds: it has low nanomolar affinity for dopamine d 2
receptors, comparable to haloperidol and risperidone, two
known potent compounds. this characteristic is correlated
with the low doses used in the clinic: 8 mgrday for
 xxxd2330xxx  žborison et al., 1995., 2–20 mgrday for
haloperidol and 2–8 mgrday for risperidone žbaldessarini,
1996.. olanzapine also has high affinity for the dopamine
d 2 receptor and is a potent compound being used  xxxd1891xxx 
mgrday žbeasley et al., 1996.. by comparison, clozapine
is used at doses of approximately 350 mgrday žbaldessarini, 1996..
affinity for a 1-adrenoceptors has also been suggested
to play a role in the efficacy of antipsychotic compounds
žbaldessarini et al., 1992..  xxxd2330xxx  has relatively high
affinity for a 1-adrenoceptors žsainati et al., 1995..
4.2. efficacy against negatiõe symptoms
corbett et al. ž1993. predicted, based on its d 1r5-ht1a
ratio of affinities and behavioral measures, that  xxxd2330xxx 
would have efficacy against negative symptoms. this has
been observed in the clinic žsee borison et al., 1995..
clozapine and risperidone also showed appropriate activity
in the d 1r5-ht1a ratio and in the rat social interaction test
žcorbett et al., 1993..
antagonist activity at the  xxxg1113xxx  has also been
suggested to predict efficacy against negative symptoms
žsee, for example, leysen et al., 1993; rao and moller,
¨
1994.. the high affinity of  xxxd2330xxx  for 5-ht2a receptors indicates that it should have efficacy against negative
symptoms.
4.3. liability for extrapyramidal symptoms
the d 2r5-ht2 ratio of k i values has been suggested
to be a predictor of liability for extrapyramidal symptoms
žjanssen et al., 1988; leysen et al., 1988; meltzer, 1989.,
that is, a high ratio predicts low extrapyramidal symptom
liability. when receptor binding data from rat membranes

421

are examined, the d 2r5-ht2 ratio of k i values was 17.4
for  xxxd2330xxx , 12.9 for clozapine and 14.3 for risperidone. for the other compounds, this ratio was less than 10.
for haloperidol, the ratio was 0.3. when examined in
human receptors, the human d 2l r5-ht2a ratio of k i
values was 12.5 for clozapine, 1.1 for  xxxd2330xxx , 2.45 for
risperidone, 1.6 for olanzapine, 1.1 for seroquel and 0.012
for haloperidol. interestingly, in rats,  xxxd2330xxx  and
risperidone have ratios comparable to clozapine. nevertheless,  xxxd2330xxx , risperidone, olanzapine and seroquel are
significantly different from haloperidol, whose human
d 2l r5-ht2a ratio is more than 10-fold lower than its rat
d 2r5-ht2 ratio.
the difference between the human and rat d 2r5-ht2
ratios is striking. it is particularly interesting that clozapine
maintains the high ratio, and that the ratio for all the other
compounds is decreased in human vs. rats. this difference
may be due to some technical aspect of the rat binding
assays. for example, the rat assays are not performed
using clonal cell lines expressing the rat receptors, a
question that can be addressed in further studies. alternatively, they may be due to true species differences in the
receptor populations. if the latter is true and we believe in
the theory that the d 2r5-ht2 ratio is a good predictor of
extrapyramidal side effects, then the newer antipsychotic
compounds ought to be different from clozapine in this
aspect of their overall profile.
a second predictor of low extrapyramidal symptom
liability may be affinity for the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor: high
affinity for this receptor has been suggested to be correlated with low extrapyramidal symptom liability žroth et
al., 1994.. this property distinguishes  xxxd2330xxx , clozapine and olanzapine from risperidone, haloperidol and seroquel. indeed, at the high end of the therapeutic dose range,
risperidone does produce extrapyramidal symptoms
žowens, 1994..  xxxd2330xxx , with its higher affinity for
 xxxg1119xxx  receptors, would be predicted to produce less žor
no. extrapyramidal symptoms.
 xxxd2330xxx  exhibited low or no propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms in a number of animal models
žszewczak et al., 1995; szczepanik et al., 1996. and in
clinical studies žborison et al., 1995..
4.4. neuroleptic-induced weight gain
transgenic mice in which expression of the 5-ht2c
receptor has been knocked out are obese žtecott et al.,
1995., suggesting that inhibition of signalling through this
receptor, for example by drugs, could produce weight gain.
interestingly, clozapine has high affinity for 5-ht2c receptors relative to dopamine d 2 receptors, and weight gain is
a significant problem in its use žsee, for example, leadbetter et al., 1992.. in contrast, haloperidol has low affinity
for 5-ht2c receptors and weight gain is less of a problem
with this compound. experience with the other compounds
is still limited; however, the receptor binding profiles

ždopamine d 2 and 5-ht2a vs. 5-ht2c . would predict that
risperidone and  xxxd2330xxx  would have fewer weight gain
problems than clozapine. olanzapine has higher affinity
for 5-ht2c receptors than for 5-ht2a receptors and has
been reported to produce weight gain žbeasley et al.,
1996..
4.5. summary
 xxxd2330xxx  has a receptor binding profile different from
any of the other antipsychotic agents studied. this profile,
together with data from animal studies, previously reported
žcorbett et al., 1993; szewczak et al., 1995; szczepanik et
al., 1996. predict that  xxxd2330xxx  will be a potent antipsychotic with efficacy against positive and negative symptoms and low propensity to produce extrapyramidal symptoms. these properties are being observed in current clinical studies žborison et al., 1995..
