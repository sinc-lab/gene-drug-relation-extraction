gating-dependent mechanisms for  xxxd2113xxx  action in  xxxg2028xxx -linked arrhythmia syndromes.  mutations in the cardiac sodium (na) channel gene ( xxxg2028xxx ) give rise to the congenital long-qt syndrome ( xxxg2028xxx ) and the brugada syndrome. na channel blockade by antiarrhythmic drugs improves the qt interval prolongation in  xxxg2028xxx  but worsens the brugada syndrome st-segment elevation. although na channel blockade has been proposed as a treatment for  xxxg2028xxx ,  xxxd2113xxx  also evokes "brugada-like" st-segment elevation in  xxxg2028xxx  patients. here, we examine how na channel inactivation gating defects in  xxxg2028xxx  and brugada syndrome elicit proarrhythmic sensitivity to  xxxd2113xxx .
