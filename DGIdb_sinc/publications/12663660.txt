(pcm) (1). ha may be found in variable amounts in many
connective tissues, where it is usually bound by large aggregating  xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycans (cspgs) (1), such as
 xxxg2407xxx  and  xxxg33xxx , or within the ecms of the brain and
central nervous system (cns), where it is most often bound by
the smaller aggregating cspgs, brevican or  xxxg1507xxx .
engineered and spontaneous loss-of-function mutations in
the  xxxg2407xxx  (2) and  xxxg33xxx  genes (3), result in mid-gestational and early postnatal lethalities, respectively. this illustrates the fundamental importance of these two cspgs and the
ha-cspg aggregates to normal development and tissue structure and function. in contrast, mice deficient in  xxxg1507xxx  develop in an apparently normal fashion (4), although they do
display disturbances in long term potentiation (ltp), which
suggests a role for  xxxg1507xxx  in the normal electrophysiological
function of the brain/cns.
the cartilage proteoglycan aggregate, consisting of ha and
 xxxg33xxx  is dependent upon  xxxg1018xxx  for its assembly and stability, with  xxxg1018xxx  and  xxxg33xxx 
binding along the ha chain in a 1:1 stoichiometry (5), i.e. one
link protein monomer for each  xxxg33xxx  monomer. in vitro
reassociation studies and in vivo loss-of-function studies have
demonstrated the critical role of  xxxg1018xxx  in the
structure and function of the cartilage proteoglycan aggregate
(6, 7). mice deficient in  xxxg1018xxx  had a phenotype
that was essentially a phenocopy of the spontaneous mouse
mutant, cmd, which results from a 7-bp deletion within the
 xxxg33xxx  gene (7, 3). the name  xxxg1018xxx  may be
somewhat of a misnomer as this protein has been reported to be
expressed or present in many other locations within both the
developing mammalian and vertebrate embryo and the adult
(8, 9). despite this, the phenotype associated with loss-of-function of  xxxg1018xxx  was restricted to the skeleton (7).
this might suggest that, while  xxxg1018xxx  is expressed elsewhere, it is essential only to the stability and
function of the cartilage proteoglycan aggregate and is not
necessary to stabilize the ha-cspg aggregates of other tissues, such as the brain and cns. the recently described brain
link protein, encoded for by the brain link protein 1 (bral1)
gene (10), is clearly related to but distinct from the cartilage
link protein in both amino acid sequence, predicted structure,
and gene organization. this suggests that a second link protein

we describe a vertebrate hyaluronan and proteoglycan
binding link protein gene family (hapln), consisting of
four members including  xxxg1018xxx . the encoded proteins share 45–52% overall amino acid identity. in
contrast to the average sequence identity between family
members, the sequence conservation between vertebrate
species was very high. human and mouse link proteins
share 81–96% amino acid sequence identity. two of the four
link protein genes (hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx ) were restricted
in expression to the brain/central nervous system, while
one of the four genes ( xxxg1019xxx ) was widely expressed.
genomic structures revealed that all four hapln genes
were similar in exon-intron organization and were also similar in genomic organization to the 5ⴕ exons for the cspg
core protein genes. strikingly, all four hapln genes were
located immediately adjacent to the four cspg core protein
genes creating four pairs of cspg-hapln genes within the
mammalian genome. furthermore, the two brain-specific
hapln genes (hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx ) were physically
linked to the brain-specific cspg genes encoding brevican
and  xxxg1507xxx , respectively. the tight physical association
of the hapln and cspg genes supports a hypothesis that
the first hapln gene arose as a partial gene duplication
event from an ancestral cspg gene. there is some degree of
coordinated expression of each gene pair. collectively, the
four hapln genes are expressed by most tissue types, reflecting the fundamental importance of the hyaluronan-dependent extracellular matrix to tissue architecture and
function in vertebrate species. comparison of the genomic
structures for the hapln, cspg genes and other members
of the link module superfamily provide strong support for a
common evolutionary origin from an ancestral gene containing one link module encoding exon.

experimental procedures

data base searching and sequence analyses—we searched the human, mouse, and “other” est databases using the complete human
 xxxg1018xxx  amino acid sequence as our search tool and the
tblastn algorithm. default search parameters were selected, except
that low complexity sequences were permitted. positive sequences were
grouped, according to amino acid identities. the nucleotide sequences
from positive est clones were used to rescreen the est databases,
using blastn, in an effort to extend the cdna sequences at the 5⬘and 3⬘-ends.
derived cdna sequences were used to screen the public domain
human genome sequence (university of california, santa cruz) in an
attempt to identify the chromosomal localization for each gene, in
addition to determination of the probable gene structures. genomic
structures for all additional members of the link module superfamily
were also obtained from the public domain human genome databases
(university of california santa cruz and the ensembl web site, ref.
18). amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the omiga
program with gaps introduced to maximize alignments. blastn and
pairwise blast (blast 2 sequences) were used to confirm nucleotide
sequences flanking and spanning exon-intron boundaries from genomic
dna sequences.
molecular cloning—est sequences were used as a starting point to
obtain full-length cdnas for each of the link protein sequences from
both human and mouse. the sequences of est clones were determined
by automated dna sequencing. oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to extend the 5⬘-termini and to confirm the 3⬘-ends using 5⬘- and
3⬘-race reactions with pcr-ready cdna pools derived from human
placenta and brain poly(a)⫹ mrnas (clontech, palo alto, ca) using
standard pcr conditions defined by the calculated annealing temperatures of the gene-specific primers. amplified fragments were directly
ligated using topo-cloning (invitrogen corp, carlsbad, ca), and sequences of resultant plasmids were determined using automated dna
sequencing. synthetic oligonucleotide primers were also designed to the
predicted translation start and stop codons to facilitate the generation
of open-reading frames for each link protein gene.
our 5⬘-race attempts to identify the 5⬘-end of the human and
mouse  xxxg1020xxx  genes were unsuccessful, presumably due to the high
relative gc content of these mrnas. for this reason, we screened an
arrayed cdna library constructed from human brain thalamus
poly(a)⫹ rna (www.rzpd.de; rzpd library number 595). partial
cdnas for human  xxxg1020xxx  were labeled using random priming with

[␣-32p]dctp, as previously described (19), and hybridized to the membrane array at 60 °c overnight in expresshyb solution (clontech) supplemented with 150 ␮g/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm dna.
membranes were washed three times for 30 min each, at 65 °c in 0.1⫻
ssc, 0.1% sds, then exposed to biomaxmr film (kodak) at ⫺80 °c
with two intensifier screens. positive clones were identified and ordered
from the rzpd. the insert sizes were determined by restriction endonuclease digestion of mini-prep quality plasmid dnas. the predicted
full-length cdna for  xxxg1020xxx  was 3.5 kilobase pairs. those clones that
possessed inserts in this size range were selected for automated dna
sequencing. to derive sequences for each hapln gene, either multiple
overlapping ests were sequenced, or single cdnas were sequenced on
both strands.
northern and multiple tissue array analyses—est clones corresponding to human  xxxg2407xxx , brevican,  xxxg33xxx , and  xxxg1507xxx ,
mfge8 and tm6sf2 were obtained from research genetics (www.resgen.com) or the american tissue culture collection (www.atcc.org) as
frozen glycerol stocks or stab-cultures. plasmids were propagated in
escherichia coli and the identity of each clone confirmed using automated dna sequencing. inserts were isolated from each plasmid clone,
and each cdna probe was radioactively labeled as described above and
sequentially hybridized to either northern blots (human poly(a)⫹ rna
blot, origene, rockville, md) or multiple tissue expression arrays
(clontech) at 60 °c in expresshyb solution supplemented with 150
␮g/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm dna under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. membranes were hybridized overnight
and washed at high stringency as described above. after membranes
had been subjected to autoradiography, they were stripped by incubation for 2 ⫻ 15 min in boiling 0.5% sds solution, then checked by
autoradiography, prior to prehybridization and hybridization with the
next probe. the same membrane was hybridized sequentially, to avoid
differences in sample loading. human ␤-actin was used as a loading
control on the mte arrays and northerns. the majority of mtes were
exposed for 16 –20 h at ⫺80 °c to biomaxmr film, whereas northerns
were typically exposed for between 2–3 days. two independent mte
array membranes were sequentially hybridized for each probe.
results

identification of a vertebrate link protein gene family—
est data base searches led to the identification of multiple
cdna sequences encoding predicted polypeptides related to
 xxxg1018xxx . numerous est sequences were identified in human (⬎300 real hits), mouse (⬎200 real hits), rat (75
real hits), and zebrafish (21 real hits). in human and mouse,
ests representing brevican,  xxxg2407xxx , cd44,  xxxg2297xxx , lyve1,
and the two recently described stabilins, stabilin1 and stabilin2
(20), were identified in addition to numerous ests encoding
polypeptides most closely related to  xxxg1018xxx 
( xxxg1018xxx ). these particular sequences could be grouped into
four classes, corresponding to  xxxg1018xxx  and three potential new
link proteins. in human, only three classes were identified, and
were designated hapln (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link
protein) 1–3, where  xxxg1018xxx  was redesignated  xxxg1018xxx . one of
the new hapln genes, hapln2, has subsequently been reported elsewhere as brain link protein 1, bral1 (10). in
addition, a partial sequence for  xxxg1019xxx  has also been previously reported as oe- xxxg1011xxx  (21). in the mouse, four classes of
link protein sequence were identified, which included  xxxg1018xxx ,
bral1,  xxxg1019xxx , and a fourth member, designated  xxxg1020xxx . all
four members were also identified in the rat, and partial sequences representing four putative hapln genes were identified
in the zebrafish, danio rerio (accession numbers, al723066,
al723003, al729072, al725723, al727046 (putative
zhapln1), aw281205 (putative zhapln2), ai616686, and
aw454110 (putative zhapln3), aw422963, and bm889913 (putative zhapln4)). this would suggest that the entire hapln
gene family is present in all vertebrates, at least as far back as
the bony fishes. we obtained our first human  xxxg1020xxx  sequences from a search of the human genome (see also below)
against mouse  xxxg1020xxx  sequences. subsequent data base
searching with the predicted human  xxxg1020xxx  cdna sequence
yielded multiple ests that corresponded to the 3⬘-untranslated

may play a role in organizing and stabilizing the ha-cspg
aggregates of the brain and cns.
ha-cspg aggregates do not act in isolation within the ecm
and pcm. these aggregates can interact with numerous other
ecm and cell surface components through binding interactions
of the cspg core protein, the  xxxd1687xxx  and/or the ha
chain. binding partners that have been identified to date, include ha receptors such as cd44 (11), egf receptors (12),
sulfated glycolipids (13), tenascins (14, 15), fibulins (16), and
neural cell adhesion molecule (15, 17). therefore, the hacspg aggregate, although present at relatively low levels in
many tissues, may provide an important nucleus within the
ecm and pcm around which an extensive matrix can be organized. accordingly, the three components that make up
known ha-cspg aggregates: ha, a large aggregating cspg
protein, and a link protein, will be expected to be critical to the
organization and function of the ecm and pcm of many tissues. lastly, by providing a relatively high local concentration
of negative charge, the ha-cspg aggregate may act locally to
concentrate or sequester cations such as sodium, in addition to
maintaining the hydrated state of many tissues.
while attempting to identify novel genes encoding ha-binding proteins, we identified multiple expressed sequence tag
(est) clones encoding predicted link module-containing sequences. further investigation of these partial sequences indicated that they represent four different genes and are predicted
to encode link proteins, homologous to  xxxg1018xxx .
we present, herein, the first description of the vertebrate link
protein gene family and suggest a probable evolutionary history for the link module superfamily.

region of human  xxxg1020xxx  only. the sequence of each clone was
confirmed and a cdna library was screened in order to obtain
full-length cdna clones for human  xxxg1020xxx . a recent search
of the ensembl genomic data base confirmed the existence of
only four bona fide link proteins in human and mouse.
the four link proteins share between 45 and 52% amino acid
identity, with overall similarities of 52– 62% (fig. 1a). the
percentage identities between human and mouse hapln proteins are: 96% ( xxxg1018xxx ), 91.5% (hapln2), 81% ( xxxg1019xxx ),
and 91% ( xxxg1020xxx ). this would suggest that there may be
important functional distinctions between the four link proteins, perhaps in their relative specificity for interaction with
one or more cspg and with ha. all four link proteins are
organized in the same way, with an n-terminal signal sequence
followed by an immunoglobulin (ig) domain and two consecutive link modules, or proteoglycan tandem repeats (ptr). the
n termini and the ig domains share the lowest overall sequence
identity.  xxxg1018xxx  binds to  xxxg33xxx  via the ig
domain (22). thus, low levels of sequence identity between the
ig domains would suggest that there may be differential specificity of interaction of the individual hapln proteins with the
cspgs (fig. 1b). all ten cysteine residues are conserved across
the family, as are the majority of those residues that have

previously been shown or predicted to be important for ha
binding in other link module superfamily members (fig. 1a)
(23).  xxxg1020xxx  differs from the other three members of the
family; it possesses a 10-amino acid glycine-rich insertion
within the first ptr and has an extended c terminus, which is
rich in the amino acids glycine, tryptophan, alanine, proline,
and  xxxd233xxx  (20/60 amino acids are gly/trp; 43/60 are
gly/trp/ala/pro/asp). based upon the primary amino acid sequence, all four hapln proteins are predicted ha-binding
proteins. indeed,  xxxg1018xxx  ( xxxg1018xxx ) and hapln2 (bral1) are
known to bind to ha (24). the functional significance of the
extended  xxxg1020xxx  c terminus is not known at this time.
 xxxg1020xxx  possesses one potential site for n-linked glycosylation, while hapln2 and  xxxg1019xxx  do not contain any consensus n-glycosylation sites. predicted molecular masses range
from 38 to 43 kda for the four hapln proteins.
tissue expression was investigated by northern analyses
with a range of samples from major organs (fig. 2). while this
selection lacked many tissues rich in ecm, it was useful in
providing a guide to the range of expression of each hapln.
our results indicated that  xxxg1019xxx  is the most widely expressed of all the hapln genes, with a transcript size of 2.1 kb
being found in most tissues, including the brain. the highest

levels of expression were observed in spleen and placenta.
 xxxg1018xxx  was expressed in a restricted manner, being expressed primarily by the small intestine and placenta. in contrast, hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx  were essentially restricted to the
brain and cns. one hapln2 transcript of ⬃1.9 kb was observed in human brain. one  xxxg1020xxx  transcript of 3.5 kb was
also observed only in human brain. our northern analyses are
supported by est data base searches, which indicated that all
of the hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx  ests were derived from brain/
cns (data not shown). overall, therefore, the hapln gene
family includes one member that is widely expressed
( xxxg1019xxx ), two members that are essentially brain/cns specific (hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx ) and a fourth member ( xxxg1018xxx )
that is expressed in a restricted subset of adult tissues. collectively, hapln genes are expressed by most tissues.
genomic analyses—we used the first draft of the human
genome sequence (25, 26) in an effort to determine the genomic
structures for each of the hapln genes. we identified all
exon-intron boundaries for each hapln gene and compared
the gene structures for hapln2,  xxxg1019xxx , and  xxxg1020xxx  with
the previously described structures for  xxxg1018xxx  ( xxxg1018xxx ) and
the four large aggregating  xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycans
genes,  xxxg2407xxx  ( xxxg2407xxx ), brevican (bcan),  xxxg33xxx  (agc1),
and  xxxg1507xxx  ( xxxg1507xxx ) (fig. 3a). hapln2,  xxxg1019xxx , and
 xxxg1020xxx  are comprised of 7, 5, and 5 exons, respectively. all
members of the hapln gene family are organized in a similar
fashion, with the signal peptide, ig domain, and two ptrs
encoded on separate exons. the first ptr of hapln2 is split
into two exons, by a unique intron (fig. 3a). exon-intron
boundaries between the signal peptide and the ig loop, between

the left of each panel.  xxxg1019xxx  is the most widely expressed, whereas
hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx  are brain-specific.

the ig loop and ptr1 and between ptr1 and ptr2 were
conserved in all hapln genes. furthermore, these exon-intron
boundaries were also shared and conserved with the four cspg
genes (fig. 3a). this conservation of gene structure strongly
supports the evolution of the hapln and the large aggregating
cspg core protein genes from a common ancestral gene.
we extended our comparative gene structure analyses of the
hapln and cspg genes to include all the remaining members
of the link module superfamily, including cd44, lyve1,
 xxxg2297xxx , stabilin1, stabilin2, and kiaa0527 (27). these members each possess a single ha-binding ptr. we identified the
exon-intron boundaries flanking the single ptr of each gene
and compared the relative position of the boundary within the
open-reading frame for each gene (fig. 3b). the exon-intron
boundary immediately preceding ptr1 is relatively close in all
members of the link module superfamily. furthermore, this
exon-intron boundary is of the same type (⫹1 position) in each
family member. the exon-intron boundary immediately following the ptr is also of this type and the position of this boundary is identical for cd44, lyve1, stab1,  xxxg2211xxx ,  xxxg2297xxx , and
kiaa0527, whereas this boundary is shifted by 2 codons in the
hapln/cspg family members. overall, therefore, this ptr
encoding cassette can be spliced in or out of each link module
superfamily transcript while maintaining the reading frame.
as such, this cassette could be recruited by genes and spliced
into an existing framework, creating a new ha-binding
protein.
our results strongly support the evolution of the 1ptr subfamily of the link module superfamily from a common ancestor
(see also fig. 5) and also suggest that the entire link module
superfamily share one common cassette, corresponding to the
first ptr of the hapln and cspg genes and the single ptr of
the remaining family members. this would support the hypothesis that all members of the link module superfamily were
derived from a single ancestral gene containing a link module
sequence through a process of gene duplication or exon recruitment and subsequent divergence. gene structure data and
amino acid sequence analyses permit a grouping of  xxxg2297xxx  with
the two stabilin proteins/genes, suggesting that these three
genes share a more recent ancestor (fig. 5). the potential
evolutionary relationship between kiaa0527 and other members of the 1ptr subfamily could not be established with current data.
while attempting to determine the gene structures for the
new hapln genes, we noticed that additional exons were
predicted immediately downstream of the human  xxxg1019xxx 
gene. closer inspection revealed that these exons corresponded
to the 3⬘ exons for human  xxxg33xxx  (agc1). the polyadenylation signals for the human  xxxg1019xxx  and the agc1 genes are
only 2.4 kilobases apart. inspection of the human genome revealed that each hapln gene was colocalized with one of the
four large aggregating  xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycan
(cspg) genes. the head-to-tail orientation of brevican and
bral1 has been recently described (28). the four paralogous
gene pairs were:  xxxg1018xxx - xxxg2407xxx  ( xxxg2407xxx ); hapln2-brevican (bcan);  xxxg1019xxx - xxxg33xxx  (agc1); and  xxxg1020xxx - xxxg1507xxx  ( xxxg1507xxx ) (fig. 4). three of the four pairs were organized in
the same manner, with the two genes facing each other in a
tail-to-tail orientation. the hapln2-bcan gene pair was organized in a tail-to-head orientation, with hapln2 lying ⬃20
kilobase pairs upstream of brevican. while the hapln1cspg2 gene pair was separated by 56 kilobase pairs, this
intergenic interval did not contain any additional genes, and it
appears that this region of the human genome is characterized
by greater intergenic distances and interexonic distances than
most others.

unequivocally supporting their evolution from a common ancestor. the position of the exon-intron splice site is indicated by the shape of each exonic
block and is described in the box below the figure. b, comparison of the genomic structures flanking the link module containing sequences for

respective positions for the exon-intron boundaries indicated by the arrowheads (indicative of a boundary at the ⫹1 position of that codon) or a star
(indicative of a boundary at the ⫹2 position of that codon). conserved cysteines are highlighted in black. other residues that are 100% conserved
are highlighted in dark gray, while residues shared by at least 4 of 7 family members are highlighted in light gray.

examination of the genes flanking the four hapln-cspg
gene pairs indicated that the gene pairs are part of a larger
cluster of paralogous genes (fig. 4). this suggests that the four
hapln-cspg gene pairs arose through a larger, possibly genome-wide duplication event. for instance, one of the four
mef2 genes was associated with each hapln-cspg pair,
although the relative position and orientation of each mef2
gene was different in relation to the hapln-cspg gene pairs.
importantly, two other paralogous genes, edil3 and mfge8
were located in the same relative position to  xxxg1018xxx  and
 xxxg1019xxx , with no paralogous genes being present in the same

position in relation to hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx . this would
suggest that the  xxxg1018xxx  and  xxxg1019xxx  gene clusters are more
closely related and arose through a more recent duplication.
the ntrk genes were also linked to the hapln-cspg gene
pairs;  xxxg1615xxx  with hapln2-bcan and  xxxg1617xxx  with
 xxxg1019xxx -agc1. in the mouse,  xxxg1616xxx  is physically linked with
the  xxxg1018xxx - xxxg2407xxx  gene pair, with an apparent translocation
event separating  xxxg1616xxx  from  xxxg1018xxx - xxxg2407xxx  in humans.
the overall organization of each gene cluster is consistent with
two large duplication events followed by multiple chromosomal
rearrangements (fig. 5). this is consistent with prevailing

21088

theories regarding vertebrate genome evolution (29, 30). those
theories hypothesize that either two genome-wide duplication
events occurred early in the evolution of the vertebrate lineage
and were followed by multiple chromosomal rearrangements
and deletions, or that multiple smaller duplications have occurred, followed by rearrangements and deletions. based upon
the organization of the gene clusters, the most recent duplication events are proposed to have generated the hapln2/
 xxxg1020xxx  and the  xxxg1018xxx / xxxg1019xxx  pairs (fig. 5).
expression analyses—we investigated the expression of
each hapln-cspg gene pair in multiple human tissues using
sequential hybridization to a multiple tissue expression array,
in order to determine if the linked gene pairs exhibited any sort
of co-expression at the level of transcription (fig. 6). in particular, we focused upon investigation of the  xxxg1019xxx - xxxg33xxx 
and  xxxg1020xxx - xxxg1507xxx  gene pairs as these two gene pairs are
separated by similar amounts of genomic dna. again, while
the range of tissue samples included most major organs, it
lacked many ecm-rich organs/tissues. thus, the results presented herein were used as a general screen to determine
broad patterns of co-expression or lack thereof, and are certainly not definitive.  xxxg1018xxx  and  xxxg2407xxx  were not coexpressed in any significant manner in adult human tissues
(data not shown). hapln2, brevican,  xxxg1020xxx , and  xxxg1507xxx , were restricted to the brain/cns and subregions and
were co-expressed, although  xxxg1020xxx  was not expressed as
highly as hapln2 (fig. 6 and data not shown).  xxxg1019xxx  and
 xxxg33xxx  were not co-expressed in a spatial fashion;  xxxg33xxx 
was restricted to the aorta and the trachea while  xxxg1019xxx 
was widely expressed. highest levels of expression for
 xxxg1019xxx  were observed in all regions of the heart, the mammary gland, ovary, lymph node, spleen, thymus, and fetal
heart and lung. genes immediately flanking the hapln-

cspg gene pairs were not co-expressed with the hapln
and/or cspg genes (data not shown).
discussion

the diverse functions of extracellular matrices are dependent upon multiple interactions between their various components. one of the more important interactions that is required
to maintain the integrity and support the functions of the ecm,
is the binding interaction between the large  xxxd1687xxx 
proteoglycans and ha, to form a proteoglycan-ha aggregate.
this aggregate is dependent upon an additional protein, aptly
named link protein. it is the binding of link protein to both the
proteoglycan and the ha polymer that strengthens and stabilizes the proteoglycan-ha aggregate. while the cartilage proteoglycan aggregate, composed of ha,  xxxg33xxx , and cartilage
link protein, is the most well known ha-proteoglycan aggregate, ha and related proteoglycans are found in most tissues.
this suggests that similar aggregates are important to the
ecm of many tissues. in particular, the brain ecm is built
largely around a ha matrix, composed of ha plus two brain/
cns specific proteoglycans, in addition to  xxxg33xxx  and  xxxg2407xxx  (for reviews see refs. 31 and 32).
most of the proteins that bind to ha at the cell surface or
within the ecm, do so through a common domain, the so-called
link domain or link module (33). this module is defined by two
disulfide bonds and is composed of two ␣-helices and two antiparallel ␤-sheets arranged around a large hydrophobic core,
similar in structure to the c-type lectin domain, a ca2⫹-dependent carbohydrate-binding domain (33, 34). the link module containing proteins constitute the link module superfamily
(33). to date, members of this superfamily have only been
identified within the vertebrate lineage. it has also been assumed that the link module superfamily evolved from a single

common ancestral protein with a c-type lectin-like domain (34)
presumably contained within a single exon. the link module
domain(s) within each superfamily member is most often contained within one or two separate exon(s) (fig. 3).
we have extended the link module superfamily through our
molecular identification of a link protein gene family composed
of four members, including  xxxg1018xxx  ( xxxg1018xxx ). we
have named this gene family, hapln (ha and proteoglycan
link protein family) where  xxxg1018xxx  becomes  xxxg1018xxx . collectively, these four link proteins are expressed by most tissue
types, and are particularly abundant in the brain/cns. indeed,
two of the four link proteins (hapln2 and  xxxg1020xxx ) are brain/
cns specific.  xxxg1019xxx  is the most widely expressed link protein
and is, therefore, expected to play an important role in the organization and stability of the ha-dependent ecm of many tissues.
we hypothesize that overlap in the spatial and temporal distribution of  xxxg1018xxx  ( xxxg1018xxx ) and  xxxg1019xxx  acts to restrict the
 xxxg1018xxx  knockout mouse phenotype to the developing skeleton.
the level of sequence identity within the hapln family and
across species strongly suggest that there may be specificity or
selectivity in the interaction of each hapln with one or more
of the cspgs. the area of lowest sequence identity within the
family corresponds to the signal peptide and the ig domain. it
is the ig region of  xxxg1018xxx  that binds to the
proteoglycan (22). we predict, therefore, that each link protein
may preferentially stabilize ha-proteoglycan aggregates comprised of specific proteoglycans. thus, where one or more cspg
or hapln are co-localized, specific complexes may be assembled through the selectivity in interaction between hapln
proteins and cspgs. alternately, all four hapln proteins may

be able to interact with all four cspgs, yielding 16 possible
interactions. furthermore, mixed complexes are entirely possible. the ability of particular hapln proteins to assemble
with particular cspgs and the biophysical properties of these
complexes will be an area of intense interest and may provide
us with an unimagined wealth of information regarding the
biological properties and functions of the ecm.
genes encoding separate components of functional protein
complexes are rarely co-localized in vertebrates. we have
shown that the four hapln genes and the four cspg genes
are organized into four paralogous gene pairs within the vertebrate genome, with each hapln gene located adjacent to a
cspg gene. this is one of the first examples of a gene family of
this type where physically linked genes encode separate components of a functional protein complex. we initially hoped that
this colocalization might be reflected by co-expression of each
gene pair, defining the most probable interacting hapln and
cspg proteins. this is partly true; the two brain/cns restricted hapln genes are physically linked to the two brain/
cns restricted cspg genes, brevican and  xxxg1507xxx . while
hapln2, brevican,  xxxg1020xxx , and  xxxg1507xxx  are co-expressed
in a broad sense in the adult brain/cns,  xxxg1018xxx  and  xxxg2407xxx 
and  xxxg1019xxx  and  xxxg33xxx  are generally not co-expressed in
the adult (fig. 6). it will be important to establish the spatial
and temporal distribution of each hapln and cspg protein
within the embryo and adult tissues at the cellular level using,
for instance, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
in this regard, hapln2 (also called bral1) has been recently
shown to colocalize with a splice variant of  xxxg2407xxx  within the
brain (24).

fig. 5. proposed evolutionary scheme responsible for the generation of the link module superfamily. we propose that an ancestral
link module-containing gene existed in an unknown invertebrate (possibly something like an echinoderm). this gene contained a common exon
encoding a single link module or ptr. gene duplication events led to the diversity of the link module containing superfamily members we know
today. the dashed line delineates the evolutionary division between invertebrate and vertebrates.

the missing links, a link protein gene family

the organization of the hapln-cspg genes into four
paralogous gene pairs, provides important clues regarding the
origin of the hapln genes and the other members of the link
module superfamily (fig. 5). we hypothesize that the first
hapln gene arose from an ancestral cspg-like gene via a
gene duplication and inversion event. at this time, however, we
cannot rule out the possibility that the ancestral gene was more
similar to the hapln gene than to the cspg. we further
hypothesize that the first link module-containing gene existed
in an invertebrate, possibly before the chordates. a common
ptr cassette consisting of one or two exons is found in all the
link module superfamily members (fig. 3). we propose that the
ancestral invertebrate link module gene contained a single
ptr within one single exon. this ancestral gene initially duplicated to give two lineages. the two lineages ultimately gave
rise to link module superfamily members containing a single
link module or proteoglycan tandem repeat (ptr), and members containing two tandem ptrs. we will refer to the 2 subfamilies as the 1ptr and 2ptr subfamilies from here onwards
(fig. 5). after the initial gene duplication and divergence event,
the 2ptr ancestor went through an internal gene duplication
event, which resulted in the presence of 2 tandem link modules.
subsequently, an additional duplication and inversion event
yielded the first hapln-cspg gene pair. we propose that
these events predate the vertebrate lineage. in this regard, we
have recently identified a single cspg gene in the invertebrate
cephalochordate, amphioxus (branchiostoma floridae).2 this
gene shares exon-intron boundaries with its vertebrate equiv2

alents and shares the highest amino acid sequence identity to
 xxxg33xxx . amphioxus lacks most of the cell and tissue types
that we associate with a ha matrix in vertebrates, and it will,
therefore, be extremely interesting to localize the various components of the ha-dependent ecm in this organism.
it has been hypothesized that two large, genome-wide, duplication events occurred relatively early in vertebrate evolutionary history (29). the alternate hypothesis states that multiple smaller scale duplications have occurred (30), which have
had the collective effect of generating many gene families in the
higher vertebrates. our model fits well with either hypothesis.
in the origin of the 2ptr subfamily, the first duplication event
appears to have been followed by specialization of one of the
gene pairs, such that its expression became restricted to neuronal cells. we propose that this event happened in an early
vertebrate. the second gene duplication event generated the
four paralogous hapln-cspg gene clusters, as we know
them. it is highly likely that a more recent rearrangement
event moved hapln2 relative to brevican. this gene organization is observed in both human and mouse. we propose that
two similar genome-wide duplication events resulted in the
higher vertebrate 1ptr subfamily, although establishment of
the paralogous relationships between cd44, lyve1, and
kiaa0257 has not been possible to establish at this point. we
propose that the first genome-wide duplication event yielded
the cd44 and stabilin branches. the second event generated
cd44 and lyve1 or kiaa0257 and  xxxg2297xxx  and a stab gene.
more recent duplication events are proposed to have resulted in
the two stab genes and the cd44 and kiaa0527 genes.
kiaa0527 may encode a novel cell-surface ha receptor, al-

the missing links, a link protein gene family
though a full-length cdna has not been reported to date. overall, the 1ptr subfamily is dominated by ha receptors, while
the 2ptr subfamily is dominated by secreted ecm proteins.
the existence of a hapln gene family and the expression
profile of its members suggests that ha-proteoglycan aggregates are present in most vertebrate tissues. the composition
of each aggregate is not known at this time, but it is tempting
to speculate that each hapln protein may have selectivity in
its ability to bind to specific cspgs and to stabilize the resultant aggregates. we assume that each hapln protein functions
in a manner analogous to  xxxg1018xxx , but we cannot
rule out additional novel functions. in particular, the significance of the extended c terminus of  xxxg1020xxx  is not clear. by
investigating the expression patterns and the in vitro and in
vivo functions of each hapln protein, we expect to obtain
novel insights regarding the function of the ha-dependent
ecm, and the importance of the ha-dependent ecm to normal
development and physiology.
