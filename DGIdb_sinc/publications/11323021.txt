abstract
heterozygosity and/or homozygosity for mutations at the genes of the enzymes involved in
homocysteine metabolism may confer an increased risk for thrombosis by causing hyperhomocysteinemia. although the mutations related
to homocysteine metabolism possibly increase
the risk of stroke, the data are conflicting and
there are very few reports linking these defects to
acute stroke in children. we aimed to study the
role of these mutations in turkish children with
ischemic stroke. forty-six patients having cerebral infarct were clinically diagnosed, and the
infarction verified with magnetic resonance
imaging of the brain was included in the study.
all patients were below the age of 18 (10 months
to 18 years). sixty-eight controls, consecutively
selected among healthy unrelated subjects from
the same geographic area of turkey without
personal and family history of thrombosis, stroke
or behest's disease, were included. genotyping
for the common mutations was carried out by the
methods described previously. there was no
difference between the pediatric stroke patients
and controls for the distribution of methylene
tetrahydrofolate reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) 677 c±t,
 xxxg1475xxx  1298 a±c, methylene tetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg1473xxx ) 1958 g ± a and
 xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx ) 66 a±g

alleles. there was no risk for double gene
alterations ( xxxg1475xxx  677 c±t vs. 1298 a±c)
after individuals with fv 1691 a mutation is
excluded. twelve of the 46 patients were found
to carry fv 1691 a mutation (26.0%), one being
homozygote. the cerebral infarct risk for fv
1691 a was found to be 6.4 (ci 95% 1.7±23.0).
eight of the 46 patients were found to carry pt
20210 a mutation (16.6%). two of the fv 1691
a heterozygous patients carried pt 20210 a
mutation at the same time (4.2%). as a conclusion, we can say that fv 1691 a and pt 20210 a
mutations are important and must be included
to the routine analysis of pediatric stroke

t

he incidence rate of cerebral infarction in
children has been reported to be 1.2
cases per 100,000 children per year [1].
although several causes or potential risk factors
exist for the occurrence of stroke in children, in
about one-third of these patients, no obvious
cause or underlying disorder can be diagnosed.
inherited gene defects related to the coagulation
system have been reported as risk factors for
ischemic stroke [2,3]. these gene defects include
g±a transition at nucleotide 1691 in exon 10 of

the factor v gene causing apc resistance and a
g±a transition in the 30 untranslated region of
the prothrombin gene at nucleotide position
20210 (g ± a), which is associated with
increased levels of prothrombin activity [4±6].
we and others recently reported that fv 1691
a, fv 4070 g and pt 20210 a mutations to be
important and independent risk factors for the
occurrence of cerebral infarcts in pediatric age
range [7±11].
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ), methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
( xxxg1473xxx ),  xxxg1479xxx  (ms),  xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx ), cobalamin
coenzyme synthesis and cystathionine bsynthase (cbs) are the enzymes that play a role
in homocysteine metabolism. deficiency of these
enzyme activities results in hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. heterozygosity and/or
homozygosity for mutations at the genes of the
enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism
may confer an increased risk for thrombosis by
causing hyperhomocysteinemia. metabolic traffic of homocysteine occurs along two major
interchanges that lead either via remethylation
to methionine or through irreversible trans-sulfuration, first to cystathionine and then to
cysteine [12 ± 14]. a c ± t polymorphism at
nucleotide 677 in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene responsible
for an alanine to valine substitution results in
the synthesis of a thermolabile form of  xxxg1475xxx 
that causes increased levels of homocysteine
[15]. although the mutations related to homocysteine metabolism possibly increase the risk of
stroke, the data are conflicting, and there are
very few reports linking these defects to acute
stroke in children including ours to common
mutation of  xxxg1475xxx  [7,8,10]. no data are available on the rest of these gene defects in the
pathogenesis of stroke.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the role
of these mutations in turkish children with
ischemic stroke.

1. materials and methods
forty-six patients having cerebral infarct were
included in the study. all patients were below
the age of 18 (10 months to 18 years). all were

clinically diagnosed, and the infarction was
verified with magnetic resonance imaging
(mri) of the brain. of these patients, there
were one protein c deficiency (pc), two with
systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), one with
cystic fibrosis (cf), two with infection, one
with sickle cell syndrome (ss), one with moya
moya disease, two homozygous beta thalassemia (b thal) and one with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency (igcd).
sixty-eight controls were consecutively
selected among healthy unrelated subjects from
the same geographic area of turkey without
personal and family history of thrombosis, stroke
or behcîet's disease [16]. blood for mutation analysis was obtained after written informed consent
from the parents, and dna was extracted by
conventional methods. genotyping for the common mutations was carried out by the methods
described previously.
the  xxxg1475xxx  677 c±t transition was determined as previously described [15]. two primers for the analysis of the c±t mutation
are 5 0-tgaaggagaaggtgtg cgcca-3 0
and 50-aggacggtgcggtgagtg-30. these
primers generate a fragment of 198 bp at an
annealing temperature of 58°c. the substitution creates a hinfi (promega, madison, usa)
recognition sequence that digests the 198-bp
fragment in 175- and 23-bp fragments on 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis.
the  xxxg1475xxx  1298 a ± c change was determined as previously described [17]. two primers
for analysis of the a ± c mutation are 5 0ctttggggagctgaaggactac-3 0 and 5 0cactttgtgaccattccggtttg-3 0. these
primers generate a fragment of 163 bp at an
annealing temperature of 58°c. the mutation
creates a mboii (fermentas, vilnius, lithuania)
restriction sites revealing five different fragments
for aa genotype (56, 31, 30, 28 and 18 bp) and
four fragments for cc genotype (84, 31, 30 and
18 bp). twelve percent polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed for the identification
of mutation.
presence of the  xxxg1473xxx  1958 g±a substitution was determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification with the primers 50c a c t c c a g t g t t t g t c c a t g - 3 0 a n d 5 0gcatcttgagagccctgac-3 0. annealing

2. results
genotype distribution of  xxxg1475xxx  677 c ± t,
 xxxg1475xxx  1298 a±c,  xxxg1473xxx  1958 g±a,  xxxg1480xxx 
66 a±g and fv 1691 g±a are given in table 1.
risk assessment of double gene alterations
( xxxg1475xxx  677 c ± t vs. 1298 a ± c) after fv
1691a mutation is excluded, and is given in
table 2. possible effect of these two mutations
on fv 1691 g/a alteration is given in table 3.
our data revealed that neither of the risk
alleles of the homocysteine metabolism-related
genes alone increased the risk for the occurrence of stroke.
genotype distribution of fv 1691 g± a is
given in table 1. twelve of the 46 patients
were found to carry fv 1691 a mutation
(26.0%), one being homozygote. one patient,
who was a combination of fv 1691 g±a and
protein c deficiency, was found to carry fv
4070 mutation at the same time. the cerebral
infarct risk for fv 1691 a was found to be 6.4
(ci 95% 1.7±23.0).
eight of the 46 patients were found to carry pt
20210 a mutation (16.6%). two of the fv 1691 a

heterozygous patients carried pt 20210 a mutation at the same time (4.2%).

3. discussion
hyperhomocysteinemia is a known risk factor
for cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, coronary heart disease and thrombosis [13,14]. heterozygosity and/or homozygosity for mutations
in the enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism may confer an increased risk for thrombosis by causing hyperhomocysteinemia. a
common mutation in  xxxg1475xxx  677 c±t has been
shown to cause increased plasma homocysteine
levels, thus, causing a predisposition to thrombosis [15].
previous studies on the effect of  xxxg1475xxx  677
c±t change on the occurrence of cva revealed
controversial data in pediatric patients [7,10].
further, the data for the  xxxg1475xxx  677t variant
and concomitant fv leiden in the risk of cva
was also controversial.
although there are several common mutations
related to homocysteine metabolism pathway,
existing data are conflicting, and there are very
few reports linking these defects to acute stroke
in children.
our data revealed that only fv 1691 a and
pt 20210 a mutations are significant for the
occurrence of pediatric cerebral infarct ( p=.003).
although we did not measure homocysteine

n. akar et al./thrombosis research 102 (2001) 115±120

levels in our patients, we found that neither of
677 t,  xxxg1475xxx  1298 c,  xxxg1480xxx  66 g and
 xxxg1473xxx  1958 a are risk factors. even when
fv 1691 a individuals were excluded, they
are not risk factors. it is worth noting that when
fv1691a patients were analysed together with
677 t and 1298 c, there exists risk only for fv
1691 a carriers.
as a conclusion, we can say that fv 1691 a
and pt 20210 a mutations are important and
must be included to the routine analysis of
pediatric stroke.
