tritiated yohimbine binding was used to estimate platelet membrane a-adrenoceptor
characteristics in normal subjects (n = 12) and patients with essential hypertension
(n = 30), primary hyperaldosteronism (n = 10) and phaeochromocytoma (n = 10).
there was a 20-fold increase in mean levels of resting norepinephrine and epinephrine
in the phaeochromocytoma group. total binding sites (b,,,,) and dissociation
constant (kg) for 3h-yohimbine did not differ significantly among the four groups.
following curative surgery for phaeochromocytoma, plasma catecholamine levels
were normalized but the bra, remained unchanged. following surgery for primary
hyperaldosteronism, levels of plasma norepinephrine rose but b,,,, was not changed. in
all but the phaeochromocytoma patients, b,,a, values correlated positively (r = 0.437,
n = 48, p < 0.01) with resting plasma norepinephrine. a significant negative correlation
was observed between the change in plasma norepinephrine in response to postural
change and resting bray. treatment for 2-4 weeks with  xxxd2241xxx  or  xxxd326xxx 
induced a parallel fall in both b,,3, and plasma norepinephrine. treatment with
reserpine was followed by a comparable fall in plasma norepinephrine, but b,,.,
values were unchanged. the findings support the view that platelet «-adrenoceptor
density is functionally regulated in parallel with sympathetic nerve activity rather than
circulating catecholamine levels, although it is not known which neuronal substance(s)
may participate in this regulation.

and &-adrenoceptors in the kidney exceeds that of con-
trols [5,6]. because the increase in o-adrenoceptors in

sensitive dahl rats, which showed a further increase dur-

 xxxg813xxx  are easily accessible for evaluation. however, there
is no clear agreement about how these receptors may be
altered in hypertensive patients [7-9].

the properties of blood cell adrenoceptors may be influ-
enced by a variety of physiological and pathological con-
ditions [1,2]. in general, adrenoceptor density is said to
be inversely related to changes in ambient catecholamine
concentrations, increasing under lower concentrations
(upregulation) and decreasing under higher concentra-
tions (downregulation). such an agonist-mediated regu-
lation has been demonstrated in lymphocyte b-adreno-
ceptors [1,2,10,11]. however, it is a matter of contro-
versy whether platelet «-adrenoceptors may be regulated
in the same manner im vivo or even in vitro [12-14].
in fact, the number of platelet «-adrenoceptors in pa-
tients with phaeochromocytoma, an in vivo model of
chronic catecholamine excess, is variously reported to be
decreased [15-17] or unchanged [18,19]. it is unclear
whether a -adrenoceptors in platelets may be a useful
model of those located in cardiovascular (postsynaptic)
or neuronal (presynaptic) tissues [20-24].

the objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the
properties of platelet «2-adrenoceptors using 3h-yohim-
bine as a radioligand, in patients with various types of
clinical hypertension with different features in sympa-
thetic nerve activity, or in circulating catecholamine lev-
els, and (2) to investigate the effects of such sympa-
tholytic drugs as  xxxd2241xxx , reserpine and  xxxd326xxx 
on platelet «2-adrenoceptors and plasma norepinephrine
levels. the results provide new evidence to support a
functional relationship between platelet «2-adrenoceptor
density and peripheral sympathetic nerve activity, but not
with circulating catecholamine levels.

subjects and methods

 

subjects

we studied the following hypertensive patients: 30 with
essential hypertension, 19 men and 11 women aged
16-67 years (mean + s.em., 40 4 3 years); 10 with pri-
mary hyperaldosteronism (conn’s syndrome), one man
and nine women aged 28-47 years (39 + 2 years); and
10 with phaeochromocytoma, eight men and two women

aged 19-70 years (48 + 4 years). the diagnoses of pri-
mary hyperaldosteronism and phaeochromocytoma were
subsequently confirmed surgically. to exclude secondary
forms of hypertension, complete diagnostic evaluations
were performed in patients with essential hypertension.
the patients in this study were chosen randomly among
our patients who did not have any grave complications of
cardiovascular, renal or metabolic disorders. patient char-
acteristics are summarized in table 1. the protocol of
this study was explained and informed consent was ob-
tained from each subject. all but one patient with malig-
nant phaeochromocytoma continued to eat either an or-
dinary hospital diet or their usual daily meals. all patients,
except two with phaeochromocytoma, were not on any
antihypertensive drug treatment before the study. the
two patients with phaeochromocytoma had both been
treated with nifedipine only, and this medication was dis-
continued at least 2 weeks before the study.

studied as controls were 12 age-matched healthy volun-
teers, 10 men and two women, aged 27-60 years (39 + 3
years). none had a history of hypertension or any abnor-
malities in routine clinical laboratory tests.

procedures

to minimize the effect of diurnal variations on plasma
catecholamines and cardiovascular responses, experi-
ments were started at 0900h. subjects fasted overnight
and were asked to refrain from smoking, beginning the
night before the study.

after subjects had rested supine for 30 min, blood pres-
sure and pulse rate were measured, and blood (30 ml)
for platelet x)-adrenoceptors was drawn via an indwelling
catheter placed in the antecubital vein. samples were
placed into polyethylene tubes containing 40mg of
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta).

blood samples (10 ml) for plasma catecholamines were
obtained via an indwelling catheter, placed in the antecu-
bital vein of subjects while they rested supine for 30 min
and again when they had been standing for 15 min.
blood sampling for plasma catecholamines and platelet
@2-adrenoceptors was performed simultaneously. blood
specimens were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min at 4°c,
and plasma (4.0 ml) was preserved with 0.1 volume of
1% sodium metabisulphate at — 20°c until assayed.

to examine the intra-individual variations of plasma
catecholamines and platelet «2-adrenoceptor properties,

measurements were repeated twice, at 1- or 2-week inter-
vals, in a representative sample of the population studied.
repeated catecholamine measurements were performed
in 27 subjects: 12 patients with essential hypertension,
four patients with primary hyperaldosteronism and 11
normotensive subjects. repeated platelet «-adrenocep-
tor measurements were made in 12 subjects: four pa-
tients with essential hypertension, one patient with pri-
mary hyperaldosteronism, four patients with phaeochro-
mocytoma and three normotensive subjects.

effects of sympatholytic agents

following baseline studies, 13 hypertensive subjects were
treated for 4 weeks with one of three sympatholytic
agents. four patients received  xxxd2241xxx  (4.0 mg/day),
six received reserpine (0.3-0.6 mg/day) and three were
treated with  xxxd326xxx  (30mg/day). plasma cate-
cholamines and platelet a -adrenoceptors were deter-
mined at the second and fourth week of each treatment,
and again 2 weeks after stopping treatment.

platelet membrane preparation

platelet membranes were prepared by the method de-
scribed by motulsky et al [25]. briefly, blood specimens
were centrifuged at 250g for 15min at 4°c to obtain
platelet-rich plasma (prp). prp was again centrifuged
at 2500 g for 10min, and the platelets were separated,
washed twice and resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic
buffer (5 mmol/l tris-hci, 5 mmol/l edta, ph 7.5). this
suspension was homogenized using brinkman polytron
pt-10 (kinematica, lucerne, switzerland) for 30s at 4°c.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 39000 g for 10 min
at 4°c, and the pellet (consisting of platelet membranes)
was washed twice with ice-cold hypotonic buffer and re-
suspended in ice-cold incubation buffer (50 mmol/! tris-
hcl, 0.5 mmol/l edta, ph 7.5).

radioligand binding assay

immediately after preparing the platelet membrane, radi-
oligand binding assay was performed as described previ-
ously [25]. a total of 100 ul of the membrane suspen-
sion (100-150 mg of protein) was incubated, in dupli-
cate, with seven different concentrations of 3h-yohimbine
(82.5-84.9 ci/mmol, new england nuclear, boston, mas-
sachusetts, usa) ranging from 0.5-16 nmol/i at 25°c for
30 min in a final volume of 250 pl. incubation was termi-
nated by adding 10 ml of the incubation buffer. the re-
action mixture was then rapidly filtered over whatman
gf/c  glass-fiber filters (whatman international, maid-
stone, uk). each filter and test tube were washed with
an additional 10 ml of incubation buffer. the filter was
air-dried and transferred to vials containing 7 ml of acs-
il (amersham, arlington heights, illinois, usa). radioac-
tivity was determined in an aloka lsc 901 scintillation
counter (aloka, tokyo, japan) at an efficiency of 38-40%.
non-specific binding was defined as the amount of ra-
dioactivity bound to membranes which was not displaced
by 10 umol/l  xxxd2914xxx . specific binding was defined
as the total binding minus non-specific binding, and
was routinely 80-90% of total binding at concentrations
around the equilibrium dissociation constant.

it had been demonstrated in preliminary studies that
the platelet «,-adrenoceptors prepared in this way
possessed the properties of saturation, rapid kinetics,
reversibility, sterospecificity and the appropriate rank
order of affinity characteristic of a -adrenoceptor bind-
ing sites. the regression lines for determination of the
dissociation constant (ky) and the maximum number of
3h-yohimbine binding sites (bmax) were calculated ac-
cording to scatchard analysis [26]. the intra-assay coef-
ficients of variation of bra, and ky were 8.0% and 7.7%,
respectively.

the concentration of protein in the platelet preparation
was determined by the method of lowry et al. [27], using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.

plasma catecholamines

plasma catecholamines were measured by a sensitive flu-
orometric method reported elsewhere [28,29]. this assay
method used a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model
mpf-4, hitachi, tokyo, japan) fitted with a high-sensitivity
cell assembly (hitachi, product no. 018-0050), and per-
mitted the accurate measurement of catecholamine lev-
els as low as 25-50 pg/cuvette (6-12 pg/ml), with coeffi-
cients of interassay and intra-assay variation each of 5%.

statistical analysis

values were expressed as means + s.e.m. statistical anal-
yses were performed by both the paired and unpaired
student’s t-test and linear regression.

results

 

resting measurements for blood pressure, heart rate and
plasma catecholamines

resting blood pressures, heart rates and plasma cate-
cholamine measurements in the four groups of subjects
are shown in table 1. compared to the normal sub-
jects, blood pressures were significantly and similarly ele-
vated in each of three hypertensive groups, and heart rate
was significantly raised in the group of phaeochromo-
cytoma patients. there was a 20-fold increase in resting
plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels in patients
with phaeochromocytoma. in the patients with primary
hyperaldosteronism, resting plasma norepinephrine lev-
els tended to be lower than in normal controls (114 + 11
versus 147 + 13 pg/ml, p< 0.1). there were no signifi-
cant differences in resting catecholamine levels in essen-
tial hypertensives and normal subjects.

platelet ~.-adrenoceptor characteristics

the total number of platelet o-adrenoceptors (bmax)
in the four’ groups are compared in fig. 1. in pa-
tients with essential hypertension, bm, was similar
to that of normotensive controls (213 + 8.2 versus
211 + 8.1fmol/mg protein). in patients with primary
hyperaldosteronism and phaeochromocytoma, bray
values were 190 + 14 and 180 + 23 fmol/mg protein, re-
spectively, but did not differ from those of normoten-
sives. the ky values, an index of affinity of 3h-yohimbine
for platelet «-adrenoceptors, were 1.9 + 0.3, 1.64 0.3

and 1.4 + 0.2nmol/i in patients with essential hyperten-
sion, primary hyperaldosteronism and phaeochromocy-
toma, respectively. none of these values differed signifi-
cantly from those in normotensive controls.

in the subjects studied, there were no sex-related
differences in bmax or kg values (males: n = 38,
bmax = 211 + 9.2 fmol/mg protein, ky = 2.2 £ 0.3 nmol/|;
females: n = 24, bmax = 197 + 8.8, kg = 1.5 + 0.2). fe-
males were divided into three groups according to phase
of menstrual cycle: follicular (n = 8), luteal (n = 7) and
menopausal (n = 9) phases. neither the by. nor the ky
values differed significantly among these groups.

in all but the patients with phaeochromocytoma, bmax
values were correlated with the baseline value of plasma
norepinephrine (r = 0.437, n = 48, p < 0.01, fig. 2).

intra-individual variations in plasma catecholamines and
platelet «-adrenoceptors

plasma norepinephrine and by, for -adrenocep-
tors were determined on two separate occasions under
identical conditions in a representative sample of the
study population. paired values were found to be very
similar (norepinephrine, 126 + 8 versus 134 + 9 pg/ml,
n= 27; bmax 189 + 15 versus 199 + 17 fmol/mg pro-
tein, n = 12). when the values of the first and sec-
ond determinations were compared, the coefficients
of correlation were highly significant (norepinephrine,
y = 0.992x — 0.443, 1r=0.913, p<0.001;  byax,
y = 1.009x + 8.00, r = 0.945, p < 0.001), indicating that
those variables were stable and reproducible under
study conditions. there were no significant differ-
ences between the first and second determinations
of kg for platelet «-adrenoceptors (2.1 + 0.6 versus
2.3 + 0.7nmol/i, n = 12).

effects of curative surgery on platelet «,-adrenoceptor
characteristics in phaeochromocytoma and primary
hyperaldosteronism

eight patients with phaeochromocytoma and eight with
primary hyperaldosteronism were studied both before
and after surgical removal of their tumors. in both
groups, surgery was curative and resulted in restora-
tion of normal blood pressure. the results of cate-
cholamine and «2-adrenoceptor determinations are sum-
marized in table 2. in the phaeochromocytoma patients,
both plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels fell
markedly to normal levels after surgery. in the hyperal-
dosteronism group, plasma norepinephrine levels rose
significantly after surgery. in neither group were there any
significant changes in bmax ot kg values.

platelet «.-adrenoceptors and responses to

postural change

in response to change from supine to standing positions,
plasma norepinephrine increased significantly, and simi-
larly, in normal subjects (154 + 6.5 to 385 + 39 pg/ml,
p< 0.01, n= 7), essential hypertensives (143 + 7.5 to
396 + 33 pg/ml, p < 0.01, n = 19) and patients with pri-
mary hyperaldosteronism (102 + 8.8 to 273 + 19 pg/ml,
p< 0.01, n = 8). in patients with phaeochromocytoma,
there was no significant change in plasma norepinephrine
levels with postural change.

a significant negative correlation was observed when
change in plasma norepinephrine levels (standing to ly-
ing) were related to baseline bmax values for all but
the phaeochromocytoma patients (r = — 0.531, n = 34,
p<0.01). this relationship is shown in fig. 3.

ever, significantly elevated biyax values were reported in
hypertensive females (but not males) by kafka et al. [8],
and in hypertensive male subjects by brodde et al. [9].
no sex differences were observed in the present study.

a number of previous studies have explored the rela-
tionships between circulating catecholamine levels and
platelet o2-adrenoceptor characteristics. these include
studies in patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors
[17], congestive heart failure [20] and chronic renal
failure and hemodialysis [31]. some investigators have
reported decreased platelet a)-adrenoceptor numbers
without change in affinity in small numbers of patients
with phaeochromocytoma [15,17]. these observations,
suggesting a possible regulatory influence of circulat-
ing catecholamines on «-adrenoceptors, have been sup-
ported by similar findings in patients with cardiac or
renal failure [20,31]. however, studies in rats with im-
planted phaeochromocytoma tumors have shown down-
regulation of tissue %;- and b,-adrenoceptors, but not &-
adrenoceptors in the kidney [32,33]. moreover, other in-
vestigators have not found any significant relationship be-
tween plasma catecholamines and platelet «.-adrenocep-
tors in man [18,19]. in our 10 patients with phaeochro-
mocytoma, bmax and kg values of platelet «2-adreno-
ceptors did not differ significantly from normotensive

controls and remained unchanged even after curative
surgery. since there was no significant difference in the
affinity (ky) from normal controls, it is unlikely that cate-
cholamines retained in the platelet membranes could ac-
count for the lack of so-called downregulation [14]. fur-
thermore, when we examined the relationship between
bmax values and plasma norepinephrine levels in all sub-
jects, excluding the phaeochromocytoma patients, a sig-
nificant positive correlation was observed, quite the op-
posite to what would be expected if increased circulat-
ing catecholamines caused downregulation of platelet a -
adrenoceptors.

several possible explanations may account for the lack
of downregulation of platelet a2-adrenoceptors in pa-
tients exposed to very high circulating catecholamine
levels. first, downregulation may occur in a receptor
subtype-selective [32-34] and/or a tissue-selective man-
ner [33,35], in the presence of excessive plasma cate-
cholamines. second, some substance(s) other than cate-
cholamines released from phaeochromocytoma may off-
set the catecholamine-induced change in platelet o-
adrenoceptors. a remarkably elevated level of plasma
 xxxg1590xxx  was found in patients with phaeochro-
mocytoma [36].  xxxg1590xxx  has been shown to in-
crease the number of o-adrenoceptors in the medulla
oblongata tissues of rats [37]. this suggests that the
catecholamine-induced decrease in platelet o2-adreno-
ceptor density might be offset by an elevation in plasma
 xxxg1590xxx  in phaeochromocytoma. elevated plasma
 xxxg1590xxx  was also observed in our patients [38].
third, platelet «-adrenoceptors might be functionally re-
lated to peripheral sympathetic nerve activity rather than
to plasma catecholamines. in fact, it has been shown that
sympathetic nerve activity is maintained intact in patients
with phaeochromocytoma [39].

the present study revealed that by, values in all
subjects, except for those with phaeochromocytoma,
showed a significant positive correlation with baseline
plasma norepinephrine. this was rather a surprising find-
ing since most studies have shown an inverse relation-
ship between circulating catecholamines and adrenocep-
tor density [16,20,31]. we cannot explain the precise
mechanism underlying such a positive correlation be-
tween bmax and plasma norepinephrine concentration.

several investigators have reported that platelet a-
adrenoceptors can be influenced by dietary sodium in
salt-sensitive (but not salt-resistant) hypertensive patients,
[40] and in normotensive subjects [41]. in the present
study, we did not measure sodium intake, nor were the
patients classified according to blood pressure responses
to dietary sodium intake. most hypertensive patients in
this study were inpatients and had a normal hospital diet,
suggesting that sodium intake would not differ among
the patients. therefore, it seems unlikely that sodium in-
take affected platelet «-adrenoceptors and the relation-
ship between platelet «-adrenoceptors and plasma nore-
pinephrine concentration although we cannot entirely ex-
clude this possibility.

bmax values were decreased during treatment with guan-
abenz and with  xxxd326xxx , but not with reserpine, de-
spite the fact that plasma norepinephrine concentrations
were comparably decreased by the drugs tested. gua-
nabenz, a potent &-agonist, is known to inhibit sym-
pathetic nerve activity through its dual actions on cen-
tral and peripheral sites [42]. its pharmacological effects,
however, could be accounted for by its central action
at the given plasma concentration of the drug adminis-
tered [43]. in contrast, reserpine interferes with uptake
of norepinephrine into the neuronal vesicles located at
the sympathetic nerve terminals, resulting in a diminished
release of norepinephrine per nerve impulse. centrally-
mediated sympathetic neural impulses may be main-
tained intact or even enhanced as a reflex compensa-
tion [44]. in fact, an increase in the release of neuronal
substances other than norepinephrine (e.g. neuropep-
tide y and dopamine-b-hydroxylase) has been reported
in reserpinized animals [45,46]. those findings would re-
inforce the view that platelet a,-adrenoceptor density is
regulated in parallel with sympathetic nerve activity (im-
pulse) rather than by circulating catecholamines per se.
it remains unclear which neuronal substance(s) would
take part in this regulation.

in the present study, a close and inverse correlation was
found between the change in plasma norepinephrine
when subjects changed from a supine to a standing
position and the byax values of platelet «2-adrenoceptors
(fig. 3). it is interesting to speculate that if presynaptic
@z-adrenoceptors are regulated in parallel with platelet
@z-adrenoceptors, then the numbers of presynaptic o-
adrenoceptors may influence sympathetic responses.

although no direct evidence is available to confirm
whether changes in platelet adrenoceptors are in fact par-
allel with those in neuronal receptors, this possibility is
supported by other findings as well: (1) an apparent par-
allel is shown in the density of a -adrenoceptors in brain,
kidney and platelets [22,23] and (2) the present study
demonstrates a considerable stability and reproducibility
of both plasma norepinephrine and platelet «-adreno-
ceptor density over prolonged periods in each individ-
ual studied, suggesting that those variables are firmly reg-
ulated by endogenous determinant(s) and, hence, their
close correlation represents a physiological rather than a
random phenomenon.

in conclusion, our findings support the view that platelet
@z-adrenoceptor density might be functionally regulated
in parallel with sympathetic nerve activity, rather than
by circulating catecholamines per se, although it is not
known which neuronal substance(s) might play the prin-
cipal role in this regulation.
