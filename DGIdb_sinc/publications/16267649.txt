 xxxd1746xxx : molecular and clinical aspects

received: 24 may 2005 / accepted: 21 june 2005 / published online: 3 november 2005
# springer-verlag 2005

abstract  xxxd1746xxx  ( xxxd1746xxx ) is a  xxxg745xxx  inhibitor (serpins) that inactivates
several different proteases in the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems.
by its c-terminal part (serpin domain), characterized by three beta-sheets and an exposed
mobile reactive loop,  xxxd1746xxx  binds, and blocks the activity of its target proteases. the nterminal end (nonserpin domain) confers to  xxxd1746xxx  the capacity to bind lipopolysaccharides
and  xxxg2048xxx . owing to this moiety,  xxxd1746xxx  intervenes in regulation of the inflammatory
reaction. the heterozygous deficiency of  xxxd1746xxx  results in hereditary angioedema (hae).
the clinical picture of hae is characterized by bouts of local increase in vascular permeability. depending on the affected site, patients suffer from disfiguring subcutaneous
edema, abdominal pain, vomiting and/or diarrhoea for edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa,
dysphagia, and dysphonia up to asphyxia for edema of the pharynx and larynx. apart from its
genetic deficiency, there are several pathological conditions such as ischemia–reperfusion,
septic shock, capillary leak syndrome, and pancreatitis, in which  xxxd1746xxx  has been reported
to either play a pathogenic role or be a potential therapeutic tool. these potential applications
were identified long ago, but controlled studies have not been performed to confirm pilot
experiences. recombinant  xxxd1746xxx , produced in transgenic animals, has recently been
produced for treatment of hae, and clinical trials are in progress. we can expect that the
introduction of this new product, along with the existing plasma derivative, will renew
interest in exploiting  xxxd1746xxx  as a therapeutic agent.

functional and structural properties of  xxxd1746xxx 
 xxxd1746xxx  ( xxxd1746xxx ) is a  xxxg745xxx  inhibitor (serpins) that inactivates several different proteases:  xxxg280xxx , c1s, and masps in the complement system, factor xii and kallikrein in
the contact system, factor xi and thrombin in the coagulation system, tpa and plasmin in
the fibrinolytic system [1–14].  xxxd1746xxx  binds and blocks the activity of its target proteases
by the suicide mechanism, which is typical of the serpins [15]. proteins of this family share
an amino acid sequence homology, which confers a similar three-dimensional structure to
the c-terminal part (serpin domain) characterized by three beta-sheets and an exposed mobile
reactive loop. the p1–p1′ amino acid bond in this loop behaves as a pseudo-substrate for
the proteases that cleave the peptide bond and covalently bind the amino acid residue. after
binding,  xxxd1746xxx  acts as a mousetrap swinging the inactivated protease from the upper to
the lower pole with insertion of the reactive loop as a fourth strand in the beta-sheet [16].
mutations causing substitutions of an amino acid involved in this conformational change
almost invariably result in loss of inhibitory activity.
the n-terminal end of  xxxd1746xxx  (non-serpin domain) has no homologies with other serpins
and is not essential for protease-inhibitor complex formation [17]. it is heavily glycosylated
with 3 n-linked and 7 o-linked carbohydrates and contains two disulfide bridges connecting
the n-terminal domain to the serpin domain [18]. mutations abolishing the disulfide bridges
lead to a conformational change that eliminates the metastable properties of the serpin
domain and allows multimerization [19]. in addition, recent studies brought important
evidence that  xxxd1746xxx  has a novel biological role as an anti-inflammatory protein. this role
does not depend on the presence of an intact reactive site, but on the carbohydrates linked to
the amino acid residues of the non-serpin domain in the amino-terminal end of the molecule.
owing to this moiety,  xxxd1746xxx  is able to bind lipopolysaccharides (lps) and  xxxg2048xxx .
hence, via direct binding to lps,  xxxd1746xxx  protects mice from lethal gram-negative endotoxemia and inhibits lps-triggered macrophage expression of tnf-alpha mrna [20]. with
this binding,  xxxd1746xxx  prevents the endothelial cell response to lps, which causes altered
cell morphology, intercellular gap formation, increased transendothelial permeability and
eventually leads to the capillary leak syndrome that complicates gram-negative sepsis and
septic shock [21]. the capacity to bind selectins is mediated by the sialyl lewis epitope, a
fucose-containing tetrasaccharide known to bind all three selectins [22], which is present in
 xxxd1746xxx  [23]. by binding  xxxg2048xxx  present in endothelial cells,  xxxd1746xxx  can concentrate at
sites of inflammation and can also regulate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration across
the endothelial surface [24]. by combining protease-inhibitory functions and these newly
described anti-inflammatory properties,  xxxd1746xxx  could play a major role in several pathological conditions: future studies will certainly delineate the actual in vivo relevance for
human diseases.
in order to have a complete scenario of the potential consequences of changes in  xxxd1746xxx 
structure and/or function, we must introduce the concept of conformational diseases and
serpinopathies [25, 26]. these terms identify a growing number of diseases arising from the
same general mechanism of abnormal unfolding and then aggregation of an underlying
protein: the new conformation of the mutant protein, rather than the reduction of its specific
function, is a fundamental pathological event. alpha1 antitrypsin, the archetypal serpin,
provided the first example of this disease mechanism. its z mutant undergoes polymerization
and aggregation, and, as a consequence, it is not secreted and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte. much of it is degraded, but the remainder aggregates

288

springer semin immun (2005) 27:286–298

to form insoluble intracellular inclusions. these inclusions are associated with hepatocellular damage, and 10% of newborn z homozygotes develop liver disease, which often
leads to fatal childhood cirrhosis [27, 28]. another single monoacid substitution of alpha1
antitrypsin (alpha 1-antitrypsin pittsburgh) modifies its protease specificity from elastase
to thrombin and causes bleeding disorders [29, 30]. conformational changes in antithrombin leading to polymerization have been shown to cause thrombosis [31]. likewise,
inappropriate folding of serpin is now investigated as the primary defect leading to degenerative encephalopathies and dementia [32]. the list of diseases in this group and the
underlying responsible serpins are still undefined and will probably be growing in the near
future.
extrapolating from the above, one could predict several pathological consequences
deriving from  xxxd1746xxx  defects and, on the other side, several potential applications of  xxxd1746xxx  as a therapeutic agent.

 xxxd1746xxx  deficiency and angioedema
in 1963, donaldson and evans discovered that subjects with hereditary angioedema (hae)
genetically lacked  xxxd1746xxx  [33]. angioedema is a self-limiting, transient, localized edema
due to a reversible increase in vascular permeability. hae patients present with functional
plasma levels of  xxxd1746xxx  ranging from less than 10% up to 35% compared to normal
subjects. this defect is associated to mutations in one of the two alleles of  xxxd1746xxx  gene
which is located in chromosome 11q11.2–q13 [18, 34, 35]. more than 150 mutations in this
gene, associated with hae, have been described so far, and a register listing all published
mutations is currently on the web (http://hae.biomembrane.hu/) [36]. the clinical phenotype
of hae, i.e. angioedema recurrence, is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait [37]. the
mutated allele and  xxxd1746xxx  deficiency segregate into families according to mendelian law
[38, 39]. from the above, one could conclude that hae is a monogenic disease, but attempts
to correlate specific mutations with phenotypic aspects such as age at onset, frequency or
severity of symptoms were unsuccessful. in front of consistently similar  xxxd1746xxx  functional
levels within the same patients throughout life and also among different patients, the clinical
phenotype may be extremely varied. frequency and severity of angioedema symptoms vary
from patient to patient as well as within the same patient from time to time. this variability
clearly does not segregate with the transmission of  xxxd1746xxx  deficiency. therefore, in hae, as
in the majority of genetic diseases, mutations cannot predict the phenotype of a patient,
indicating that genetic factors and the environment might be important modulating factors
[40].
this conclusion does not lessen the importance of mutation screening in hae families.
besides the obvious value of the genetic diagnosis, these experiments could provide new
insight into the understanding of conformational diseases and serpinopathies. moreover,
identifying mutations in  xxxd1746xxx  gene may still shed some light on the clinical variability of
disease expression. clinical phenotypes primarily dependent on protein conformation more
than on protein function have low penetrance and probably need a cofactor to become
expressed. as we can learn from the molecular studies on the z mutant of alpha1 antitrypsin,
temperature and rate of protein synthesis influence its polymerization, and the pro-inflammatory effect of the polymers is exacerbated by the presence of endogenous mediators,

springer semin immun (2005) 27:286–298

289

such as inflammatory cytokines or external factors such as cigarette smoke [16, 27].
therefore, we can expect that a clinical phenotype arising from the conformational change
induced by specific mutations will present a wide range of variation depending on the
individual history of exposure to infections, environmental factors, genetic background, etc.
hence, a better understanding of the size and impact of conformational diseases will come
from combining careful analysis of specific genotype/phenotype correlates with the understanding of the structure/function correlates of specific mutations.  xxxd1746xxx  offers a
valuable opportunity to reach this goal: there is the register of mutations already mentioned,
and there is a register of hae patients which already contains more than 1,000 entries with
detailed clinical information (http://www.haeregister.org). physicians, scientists, and also
patients who are working on these registers in europe are associated in an active and
expanding network [41]. these resources represent the appropriate background to exploit
molecular studies on  xxxd1746xxx  mutants to understand clinical variability.
identification of candidate factors governing the variability of angioedema recurrence in
hae patients is a main target for development of new therapeutic approaches. the episodic
appearance of angioedema in  xxxd1746xxx -deficient patients has been associated to further
derangement of the defective control of activation of the contact/complement system, a direct
result of the genetic defect [42–47]. the relative importance of these two systems in the
pathogenesis of angioedema has been largely debated as detailed in recent reviews on this
topic [48–50]. the controversial point has been the final mediator of the increased vascular
permeability: a c2-derived peptide, in the “complementcentric theory” and bradykinin, in the
“contactcentric theory”. nowadays the contribution of the contact system and bradykinin is
supported by a large mass of data coming from in vitro studies, analysis of patients, and
analysis of  xxxd1746xxx -deficient mice. we know now that contact system is activated during
attacks [45, 46]. when depleted of enzymes inducing contact activation,  xxxd1746xxx -deficient
plasma loses its capacity to generate vascular permeability-enhancing activity [51]. during
angioedema attacks,  xxxd1746xxx -deficient patients have increased plasma levels of bradykinin,
which is generated in the affected site [52, 53]. a  xxxd1746xxx  mutation, which selectively blocks
the complement inhibitory activity but not the activity of  xxxd1746xxx  on the contact system,
causes depletion of classical pathway complement components but does not result in
angioedema [54].  xxxd1746xxx  knockout mice, both homozygous and heterozygous, do not have
obvious angioedema episodes but present an ongoing increased vascular permeability, which
depends on  xxxd1746xxx  deficiency being corrected by intravenous  xxxd1746xxx  [55, 56]. such an
increased vascular permeability depends on contact system activation and is mediated via
bradykinin receptor 2 (bk2r). these data lead to the conclusion that in  xxxd1746xxx  deficiency,
angioedema takes place in sites where bk2r is stimulated by bradykinin released upon
kallikrein generation. highly specific and potent inhibitors of kallikrein and bk2r are now
under investigation for their ability to revert angioedema in hae patients [57–59]. data
from these studies should rapidly confirm, in a clinical setting, the appropriateness of
the pathogenic view, which has been extrapolated from the laboratory.
as mentioned, the clinical picture of  xxxd1746xxx  deficiency is characterized by angioedema,
i.e. bouts of local increase in vascular permeability. depending on the affected site, patients
suffer from disfiguring subcutaneous edema, abdominal pain, vomiting and/or diarrhoea for
edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa, dysphagia, and dysphonia up to asphyxia for edema of
the pharynx and larynx [60]. the episodes last from 2 to 5 days and usually render patients
incapable of pursuing their normal activities. half the patients become symptomatic during
the first decade of life and less then 10% after the second. one third of untreated patients have

290

springer semin immun (2005) 27:286–298

more than one attack per month, while in another third, the disease tends to be mild with a
few attacks per year. however, even patients with the mild form may experience lifethreatening laryngeal edema [61]. attacks can be spontaneous, but microtrauma and psychological stress are frequently recognized as triggering factors. due to the disabling
consequences of attacks and to the risk of fatality, treatment is a crucial issue in hae. the
classical approach comprises: (a) long-term prophylaxis, for patients with frequent severe
attacks, (b) short-term prophylaxis, for patients exposed to potential triggers of laryngeal
attacks (e.g. medical manipulation traumatizing the oropharynx), (c) treatment to revert an
ongoing attack. detailed reviews on the clinical approach to hae and its treatment have
recently been published, and therefore we will not further review this topic [41, 62–64].
three new compounds are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their capacity to
revert acute attacks in hae patients. the first one,  xxxd1961xxx  (dyax corp., cambridge, ma), is a
novel recombinant protein with potent and specific inhibitory activity for plasma kallikrein.
one randomized placebo-controlled and two open label studies have been performed so far
with a total of 230 doses administered intravenously to more than 130 patients [59]. the
second is a recombinant human  xxxd1746xxx  isolated from the milk of transgenic rabbits
(pharming technologies bv, leiden). nine acute attacks have been treated in a phase ii open
label study; a randomized, controlled study is ongoing [65]. the third is  xxxd2317xxx  (jerini ag,
berlin), a potent, specific  xxxg258xxx  antagonist. twenty attacks have been
treated so far in an open label study, 12 by intravenous infusion and 8 by subcutaneous
injection [66]. randomized, controlled studies are ongoing with the subcutaneous formulation. for all three compounds, the available results appear to be favorable.
ongoing clinical trials for treatment of acute attacks in hae patients are not restricted to
new compounds. plasma-derived  xxxd1746xxx  represents an established treatment for acute
attacks in hae patients [67–70] and has been approved for this purpose in most european
countries for 20 years or more. however, this product is not available in the united states.
for this reason, zlb behring (marburg) and lev pharmaceutical inc. (new york, ny) have
just started recruiting hae patients for clinical trials with their plasma-derived c1-inhs.

 xxxd1746xxx  and other diseases
based on the wide range of biological activities of  xxxd1746xxx , one could expect several clinical
abnormalities to result from its deficiency. instead, patients lacking  xxxd1746xxx  appear perfectly
normal except for angioedema; also  xxxd1746xxx  k.o. mice, both heterozygous and homozygous, do not present obvious phenotypic abnormalities [55]. nevertheless, there are several
pathological conditions in which  xxxd1746xxx  has been reported to either play a pathogenic role
or be a potential therapeutic tool. these conditions will be briefly analyzed below.

ischemia–reperfusion injury
this term refers to the pathological events that follow restoration of blood flow to ischemic
tissues. ischemia rapidly damages metabolically active tissues, and reperfusion paradoxically
initiates a cascade of pathologies that leads to additional cell or tissue injury. it can occur
spontaneously during a pathological event, but its clinical relevance has grown tremendously

springer semin immun (2005) 27:286–298

291

with expansion of techniques aimed at restoring patency of occluded arteries and of organ
transplantation. complement activation and neutrophil stimulation are two major components in events leading to tissue injury [71]. during reperfusion, complement can be activated
by exposure to intracellular components such as mitochondrial membranes or intermediate
filaments. two elements of the activated complement contribute directly or indirectly to
damage: anaphylatoxins ( xxxg282xxx  and c5a) and the membrane attack complex [72]. the use of
specific inhibitors may find wide clinical application because there are no effective drug
therapies currently available to treat i/r injuries [73]. in a model of i/r, organs of transgenic
animals overexpressing  xxxd1746xxx  are protected from endothelial cell damage [74].  xxxd1746xxx 
has been tested as potential therapy for i/r injury either in models such as the ischemic
muscle [75, 76] or in specific diseases.
i/r injury of the myocardium that follows coronary artery occlusion has been investigated
in animal studies, in which it has been shown that  xxxd1746xxx  has the capacity to reduce the
myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury [77–80]. the effect of intravenous  xxxd1746xxx  following reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction has also been tested in pilot
human studies. three patients received  xxxd1746xxx  as rescue therapy for severe reperfusion
injury after coronary surgery, with rapid hemodynamic stabilization [81]. in one study,
specifically designed to assess the effects of intravenous  xxxd1746xxx  following reperfusion
therapy in 22 patients with acute myocardial infarction, this treatment was proved to be safe
and effective in reducing complement activation [82]. due to the small size of the population
and the absence of a control group, it was not possible to reach a statistically significant
conclusion on clinical effectiveness.
brain damage following ischemia has recently become a major area of investigation with
the possibility to exploit these studies for treatment of stroke, one of the major causes of death
and disability worldwide, and for which there is still no effective therapeutic tool. different
animal models of ischemic brain have been studied. important evidence for a neuroprotective
activity of  xxxd1746xxx  has been provided by the group of bergamaschini using a murine model
of transient ischemia induced by introducing a nylon microfilament into the middle cerebral
artery [83–85]. analogous positive conclusions were also reached with other animal models
of brain ischemia and of brain damage deriving from hypothermic circulatory arrest [86–88].
we expect that these results will be confirmed in controlled human studies.
i/r injury mediated by complement activation also occurs during organ transplantation.
such an activation and related pathological consequences can be prevented by  xxxd1746xxx .  xxxd1746xxx  has been circulated into the organ before implant [89, 90] or added to the preserving
solution that protects the organ during transport [91]. exposure of organs to be transplanted
to high concentrations of  xxxd1746xxx  significantly reduces such complications due to the
capacity of  xxxd1746xxx  to bind endothelial cells maintaining intact functional capacity [92].

septic shock
severe sepsis and septic shock are inflammatory diseases triggered by bacterial infection.
despite antibiotics and supportive care, mortality remains extremely high varying from 20 to
50%. complement and contact systems are activated in sepsis and probably involved in
its pathogenesis [93, 94]. specifically in plasma from septic patients, there is a relative
deficiency of  xxxd1746xxx  due to its proteolytic inactivation by  xxxg694xxx . in addition
to these studies, the rationale for supplying  xxxd1746xxx  to patients with sepsis is further

292

springer semin immun (2005) 27:286–298

supported by animal models of this condition showing the protective effect of this protein
[95–98]. when these studies have been transferred to humans, the positive effect of  xxxd1746xxx  has been confirmed either in anecdotal reports or in pilot studies [99–101]. however,
none of these studies has been designed with appropriate control groups to reach a definitive and statistically proven conclusion.

other diseases
in addition to the above conditions, diverse reports suggest additional clinical indications
where  xxxd1746xxx  infusion could be beneficial. experimental pancreatitis can be prevented by
conditioning animals with human  xxxd1746xxx . these findings have been confirmed in several
different animal models [102–106] but are difficult to transfer to humans where treatment
cannot obviously anticipate the development of the disease. only few experiences have been
reported in humans and in very specific situations. one is the report of two children who
improved upon  xxxd1746xxx  after developing an acute pancreatitis following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [107]. the other is a pilot study performed by our group, in
which we demonstrated that administration of  xxxd1746xxx  reduces hyperamylasemia consequent
to endoscopic cholangio-pancreatography, a procedure that can be complicated by overt
clinical pancreatitis [108].
reduction in  xxxd1746xxx  plasma levels and complement activation have been involved in the
pathogenesis of reactions to radiographic contrast media (rcm). the pathogenic mechanism
causing this reaction is still not defined. signs of activation of complement and contact
systems have been detected during rcm infusion. these findings, along with the evidence
for reduced plasma levels of protease inhibitors, and specifically of  xxxd1746xxx , led to the
hypothesis that reduced control of these systems could underlie rcm reactions [109–115].
this hypothesis has never been definitively proven, and supporting data have been hampered, at least partially, by hemodilution accompanying infusion of rcm with elevated
osmotic activity that alters plasma protein concentration [116].
a final field of intervention for  xxxd1746xxx  is vascular leakage. it may occur spontaneously,
as in idiopathic capillary leak syndrome (clarkson disease), a lethal disease characterized
by recurrent fluid extravasations leading to hypovolemic shock underlain by marked
hemoconcentration (hematocrit as high as 80%) [117]. however, a clinical picture
dominated by fluid extravasation can complicate diseases such as septic shock or burns, or
specific therapeutic interventions such as treatment with recombinant  xxxg1173xxx , bone
marrow transplantation, and cardiopulmonary bypass. a role for  xxxd1746xxx  in these
conditions is supported by evidence of activation of its target proteases in animal models
and by anecdotal experience in humans [118–130].
in conclusion, we can see a broad area of intervention for  xxxd1746xxx  as a therapeutic tool.
some of these potential applications were identified long time ago, but we have not yet seen
any controlled study supporting anecdotal reports or pilot experiences. in the last few years, a
recombinant  xxxd1746xxx , produced in transgenic animals, has been proposed for treatment of
acute attacks in patients with hae, and clinical trials with this product are, at present, in
progress in north america and europe [65]. we can expect that the introduction of this new
product, along with the existing plasma derivative, will renew interest in exploiting  xxxd1746xxx 
as a therapeutic agent in conditions other than genetic deficiency.
