abstract:  xxxg587xxx  (cyp2c9) is one of the most abundant cyp enzymes in the human liver. cyp2c9 metabolizes more
than 100 therapeutic drugs, including  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , diclofenac, celecoxib,  xxxd3404xxx , phenytoin losartan, and  xxxd990xxx .
some natural and herbal compounds are also metabolized by cyp2c9, probably leading to the formation of toxic metabolites. cyp2c9
also plays a role in the metabolism of several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and  xxxd208xxx . many
cyp2c9 substrates are weak acids, but cyp2c9 also has the capacity to metabolise neutral, highly lipophilic compounds. a number of
ligand-based and homology models of cyp2c9 have been reported and this has provided insights into the binding of ligands to the active
site of cyp2c9. data from the site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that a number of residues (e.g. arg97, phe110, val113,
phe114, arg144, ser286, asn289, asp293 and phe476) play an important role in ligand binding and determination of substrate specificity. the resolved crystal structures of cyp2c9 have confirmed the importance of these residues in substrate recognition and ligand orientation. cyp2c9 is activated by dapsone and its analogues and r- xxxd2444xxx  in a stereo-specific and substrate-dependent manner,
probably through binding to the active site and inducing positive cooperativity. cyp2c9 is subject to induction by rifampin, phenobarbital, and dexamethasone, indicating the involvement of  xxxg1598xxx ,  xxxg1599xxx  and  xxxg1601xxx 
in the regulation of cyp2c9. a number of compounds have been found to inhibit cyp2c9 and this may provide an explanation for some
clinically important drug interactions. tienilic acid,  xxxd3265xxx  and silybin are mechanism-based inhibitors of cyp2c9. given the critical
role of cyp2c9 in drug metabolism and the presence of polymorphisms, it is important to identify drug candidates as potential substrates, inducer or inhibitors of cyp2c9 in drug development and drug discovery scientists should develop drugs with minimal interactions with this enzyme. further studies are warranted to explore the molecular determinants for ligand-cyp2c9 binding and the structure-activity relationships.

1. introduction
drug metabolism determines the pharmacokinetic properties of
drugs and is involved in the disposition of a large number of natural
and human-made compounds. in phase i metabolism, reactive
groups are introduced into the parent molecules, while the drug or
its metabolite is conjugated to small, hydrophilic endogenous molecules such as glucuronic acid in phase ii metabolism. the cytochrome p450 (cyp, ec1.14.14.1) superfamily is the most important phase i enzyme that oxidizes a large number of endogenous and
exogenous compounds including >90% of clinical drugs, many
procarcinogens, toxins, steroids, and arachidonic acids [1]. the
cellular localization of cyps is either in the endoplasmic reticulum
or in mitochondria. drug metabolizing cyps are almost exclusively
localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and receive the reducing
equivalents from the flavoprotein nadph-p450 oxidoreductase
(cpr) [2]. in the general reaction of cyp-catalyzed oxidation, the
ferric form of cyp binds the substrate and is subsequently reduced
to the ferrous molecule, which then captures molecular oxygen [3].
with the possible involvement of cytochrome b5, a second electron
is introduced via the cpr into the oxygenated form of the hemoprotein. this results in the activation of the bound oxygen, one atom of
which is introduced into the substrate, with the other atom being
reduced to water. finally, dissociation of the oxidized metabolite
restores the ferric form of cyp.
to date, there are 57 functional cyp genes and 58 pseudogenes
identified in the human genome (http://drnelson.utmem.edu/ cytochromep450.html, access date: 27 may 2009). cyps are classified
into families, subfamilies, and individual enzymes based on amino
acid sequence homology. cyp1, cyp2 and  xxxg1812xxx  families are the
major contributors to the oxidative metabolism of more than 90%

of clinical drugs with cyps in other families playing a major role in
the metabolism of endogenous substances including steroids, fatty
acids, arachidonic acids, bile acids, and bilirubin [1]. the relative
abundance of the human hepatic cyps has been determined as:
cyp1a2 (13%),  xxxd577xxx  (4%), 2c (20%), 2d6 (2%),  xxxd851xxx  (7%), and
3a4 (30%) [4]. a recent study has demonstrated that of the 110
commonly used drugs, 66% are metabolized by one or more cyp
enzymes, 44% by cyp3a4, 41% by cyp2d6, 26% by cyp2c19,
9% by cyp1a2 and 4% by cyp2c9 [5]. most cyps are subject to
induction and inhibition, and genetic mutations play an important
role in the variation of enzyme activity of many cyps such as
cyp2c9, 2c19, and 2d6 [6-8].
the cyp2c subfamily comprises  xxxg586xxx , 2c9, 2c18 and
2c19, metabolizing 30% of clinical drugs [9].  xxxg586xxx , 2c9, and
2c19 proteins are primarily located in the liver, accounting for
20% of total cyp contents [4], whereas  xxxg584xxx  protein seems
to be primarily expressed in the skin [10]. cyp2c9 is the second
most prevalent cyp enzyme in the small intestine of humans [11].
in human liver tissue, cyp2c9 is present at a much higher level
than cyp2c19 [4], with molar ratios of cyp2c9 to 2c19 reported
as 13:1 to 17:1 [12, 13]. low to moderate levels of other cyp2c
mrnas and proteins have also been detected in small intestine and
other extra-hepatic tissues [14].  xxxg586xxx , 2c9, 2c18 and 2c19
share >82% amino acid identity, but they have distinct substrate
specificity [15]. typical substrates for cyp2c9 are diclofenac,
 xxxd3394xxx , and  xxxd990xxx ; while specific substrates for cyp2c19
are r-omeprazole and s- xxxd2568xxx . phenytoin is stereospecifically oxidized on the pro-s phenyl ring by cyp2c9, whereas
cyp2c19 shows little prochiral selectivity for aromatic hydroxylation [16].  xxxg586xxx  metabolizes paclitaxel [17, 18],  xxxd159xxx 
[19], chloroquine [20], troglizones [21, 22], and zopiclone [23] with
high activity. however, the human cyp2cs exhibit some overlap
of substrate specificity such as the metabolism of diclofenac and
warfarin, although the warfarin stereoisomers are metabolized differently by different cyp2c enzymes. both cyp2c9 and 2c19

the four human cyp2c genes have been mapped to chromosome 10q24, located in a densely packed region in the following
order: cen- xxxg584xxx -cyp2c19-cyppp2c9- xxxg586xxx -tel (fig.
(1)) [27, 28]. cyp2c9 encodes a protein of 490 amino acids, with a
molecular weight of 55.6 kda. the enzyme exists in a variety of
polymorphic forms, with some 30 point mutations identified, several of which alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme
(http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2c9.htm, access date: 27 may
2009). subtle primary sequence changes in cyp2c9 can have dramatic effects on therapeutic response and drug-related toxicity.
therefore, understanding the structure-function relationships of this
versatile drug-metabolizing enzyme is important in drug development and clinical practice.

3. structure-activity relationships of human
cyp2c9

cyp2c9 (previously called p450- xxxg448xxx , p450tb,  xxxg587xxx ,
 xxxg587xxx , mgc88320 and mgc149605) metabolizes approximately
20% clinical drugs (>100 drugs), including some drugs such as swarfarin,  xxxd3394xxx  and phenytoin with narrow therapeutic windows [15]. the substrates of cyp2c9 include oral sulfonylurea
hypoglycemics (e.g.  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd2202xxx 
and  xxxd2204xxx ), non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids, e.g.
diclofenac, ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd3265xxx , naproxen,  xxxd2141xxx ,
indomethacin,  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx ,  xxxd3311xxx , and  xxxd2508xxx );
selective  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib,
 xxxd2517xxx ,  xxxd2069xxx , and  xxxd3481xxx ), diuretics (e.g.  xxxd3404xxx 
and  xxxd3256xxx ), antiepileptics (e.g. phenytoin and phenobarbital),  xxxg99xxx  receptor inhibitors (e.g. losartan, irbesartan, and
candesartan), anticancer drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide and tamoxifen), and anticoagulants (e.g. s- xxxd59xxx ,  xxxd2911xxx  and  xxxd990xxx ) [15, 29]. cyp2c9 is induced and inhibited by
a number of compounds. this paper highlights and updates our
current knowledge on the substrates, inducers and inhibitors of
cyp2c9 and the implication in drug development.

3.1. data from homology and pharmacophore modelling and
docking studies
before the release of cyp2c9 crystal structure in 2003 by williams et al. (2003) [30], there had been some understanding of the
active site of cyp2c9 and ligand (substrate or inhibitor) binding
from modelling and site-directed mutagenesis studies. various
models of cyp2c9 have been developed to explain its preference
for weak acids and substrate specificity. these include protein (homology) models, pharmacophore models, and comfa/qsar
based models. homology modeling of the cyp2c9 protein based
on crystal structures available for bacterial cyps and rabbit
cyp2c5 which is the first mammalian cyp structure solved has
been used to generate hypotheses regarding the active site topology
of cyp2c9. the most commonly used template, the
cyp102/p450bm3 crystal structure from bacillus megaterium [31],
shares about 20% amino acid sequence identity to the human
cyp2c subfamily. the amino acid sequence identity between rabbit cyp2c5 and the human  xxxg586xxx , 2c9, 2c18, and 2c19 varies
between 77% and 83%. because of the high-sequence homology
between human cyp2c9 and rabbit cyp2c5, models based on
cyp2c5 are more reliable than those based on bacterial cyp crystal structures. initial work has suggested a schematic model for
cyp2c9 binding that contained hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding
regions [32].
the structural requirements of cyp2c9 for substrate binding
were speculated by smith and jones (1992) [33] based on the finding that typical cyp2c9 substrates have at least one site for hydrogen bond formation between 5-10 å from the site of oxidation and
many (not all) cyp2c9 substrates contain an ionizable carboxylic
acid moiety located 7-11 å away from the known position of oxidation by cyp2c9. both authors have suggested that hydrogen bonding and probably ion-pair interactions play a major role in determining the substrate specificity of cyp2c9.
3.1.1. protein (homology) models
based on amino acid sequence alignment and the crystal structure of the bacterial cyp101, a preliminary three dimensional (3d)
homology model of cyp2c9 has been constructed by korzekwa
and jones (1993) [34]. in this model, potential substrate recognition
sites were found to be distal to the porphyrin.

lewis (1995) [35] described a homology model of human
cyp2c9 based on the structure of bacterial p450102 (cyp102)
haemoprotein domain (pdb code: 2hpd) and found that both progesterone and  xxxd3394xxx  (a weak acid with pka of 5.4) formed a
hydrogen bond with ser365 which appeared to reside in the active
site region of 2c9. the two cyp2c9 substrates, phenytoin and
 xxxd3394xxx , were readily superimposed on their position of oxidation within the putative cyp2c9 active site by hydrogen bonding to
ser365.
wiseman and lewis (1996) [36] reported a homology model of
cyp2c9 derived from bacterial p450102. in this model, ser365
appeared to interact with tamoxifen, a weak base with a pka of
10.7. this serine residue represents a potential hydrogen bond donor for interaction with substrates that contain atoms such as o, n
or f. ser365 in cyp2c9 corresponds to ser364 in rabbit cyp2c3
whose mutation has been shown to significantly affect the regioselectivity of progesterone metabolism [37].
lewis et al. (1998) [38] have refined the homology model of
cyp2c9 based on bacterial cyp102, with incorporation of all
known results from site-directed mutagenesis studies and antibody
recognition information, which was quite different from the previous and later cyp2c9 models. further docking studies have revealed that  xxxd3394xxx  was orientated above the haem iron in the
active site of cyp2c9 by hydrogen bond with ser365, -stacking
interaction with phe100, and hydrophobic contacts between the nbutyl group and the side-chains of ile99 and val473. phenytoin and
ibuprofen, two weak acids with pka of 8.1 and 4.5, respectively,
can be orientated within the active site of cyp2c9 by hydrogen
bonding with ser365 and -stacking interaction with phe100. similarly, diclofenac (pka = 4.22),  xxxd990xxx  (pka = 5.1), and tienilic
acid (pka = 4.8) can be orientated in the active site of cyp2c9 via
hydrogen bonding with ser365 and -stacking interaction with
phe100. sulfaphenazole, a selective cyp2c9 inhibitor, was orientated in the active site of cyp2c9 by hydrogen bond with asn474
instead of ser365 with the sulfonamide group, -stacking interaction with phe100, and hydrophobic contacts with the side-chains of
val113 and ala297 [38].
in this refined homology model of cyp2c9, lewis et al. (1998)
[38] have proposed that lys77 is positioned within the substrate
access channel, which may be responsible for substrate selection
and recognition. this residue is analogous to arg47 in bacterial
cyp102 (p450 bm3), where it indirectly interacts with substrate
via a hydrogen-bonded water network [39]. residues ile99, phe100,
and ser365 have been suggested to be involved in substrate binding
in this model.
in the homology model of cyp2c9 established by payne et al.
(1999) [40], arg105 and arg97 as key cationic residues, as well as
asn202, asp293, pro101, leu102, gly296, and phe476, have been
suggested to play an important role in the binding to s-naproxen,
phenytoin, and progesterone. rao et al. (2000) [41] have constructured a homology model of cyp2c9 together with a refined ligandbased comfa model based on the structures of bacterial cyp101,
cyp102, and cyp107a. this model has suggested that phe110 and
phe114 might be involved in aromatic binding interactions and that
arg105 and asp293 might be responsible for electrostatic interactions. the anionic interaction site was predicted to be arg105 from
this homology model and the carbonyl oxygen at the c2 position of
coumarin may interact with asp293 in helix i, possibly through a
bridging water molecule. the role of asp293 in substrate binding
has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments [42].
the comfa model is a refined model of the previously developed
by jones et al. (1996) [43]. when the ki was predicted using the
model, the prediction for the 14 new compounds was reasonable.
this model is useful in that they establish a pharmacophore for
binding to cyp2c9 that can be further evaluated with site-directed
mutagenesis assays. the model can also be used to screen for po-

zhou et al.

tential drug interactions and to design compounds that will not bind
to cyp2c9 with high affinity.
tsao et al. (2001) [44] developed a set of homology models for
cyp2c9 and 2c19 based on cyp2c5 to identifiy the amino acid
residues responsible for conferring s- xxxd2568xxx  4’-hydroxylation
activity onto cyp2c9. chimeras were constructed by replacing
fragments of cyp2c9 containing various putative substrate recognition sites (srss) with those of cyp2c19 and mutating individual
residues by site-directed mutagenesis. mutagenesis studies identified six residues in three topological components of the proteins
required to convert cyp2c9 to an s- xxxg585xxx 
[44]. of these, only the ile99his mutant located in srs1 between
helices b and c reflected a change in a side chain that is predicted
to be in the substrate-binding cavity above the heme group. two
additional mutations, ser220pro and pro221tyr located between
helices f and g but not in close proximity to the substrate binding
site together with five differences in the n-terminal portion of helix
i conferred s- xxxd2568xxx  4'-hydroxylation activity onto cyp2c9.
three mutations in helix i, ser286asn, val292ala, and phe295leu,
were essential for s- xxxd2568xxx  4'-hydroxylation activity. these
results have suggested that the selective metabolism of smephenytoin over r- xxxd2568xxx  was due to the presence of amino
acids that influenced the packing of structural elements or influence
the substrate access channel instead of altering the active site directly.
afzelius et al. (2001) [45] reported a homology model of
cyp2c9 based on rabbit cyp2c5 crystal structure. this model has
suggested a role for val113, phe114, leu201, asp204, ile205,
asp293, ala297, leu362, leu366, and phe476 in interacting with
various inhibitors of 2c9. the model was able to predict the k i
values within 0.5 log units of the experimental ki values. a 3dqsar model was inserted into the cyp2c5-based homology
model.
on the basis of above rabbit cyp2c5-derived homology model
of cyp2c9 [45], ridderstrom et al. (2001) [46] further developed
the homology models for  xxxg586xxx , 2c18, and 2c19 based on rabbit cyp2c5 crystal structure to investigate the selectivity of the
enzymes and the important amino acids that determine the substrate
specificity of each cyp2c enzyme using grid/consensus principal
component analysis (cpca). in the grid calculations 10 probes
were used covering hydrophobic, steric, and hydrogen bond acceptor and donor interactions. the following single-atom probes were
used in the calculations: dry, c3, n1, n:, nh=, n1+, nm3, o,
oh, and the multiprobe coo-. the selectivity analysis revealed
that the most important determinants of selectivity among the
cyp2cs are the geometrical features of the active sites and the
hydrophobic interactions [46]. for example, the first component
that discriminates  xxxg586xxx  from other three cyp2cs using the
steric c3 probe has a selective region with amino acid 476 in the
rigid analysis, with the addition of amino acids in positions 475 and
478, while the second selective region is close to position 362 in the
rigid analysis with the addition of residue 361 [46]. the second
component that discriminates  xxxg584xxx  from the other three
cyp2cs is also selective in the region around positions 475 and
476 where an ala and phe are found. in the flexible analysis,
ala475 and gly477 are also selective for  xxxg584xxx . the selectivity
for 2c9, described by the third component, has phe476 and ala477
that are selective in the first region and leu 362 in a second region.
in the flexible analysis, lys206 and ala477 are selective for
cyp2c9 [46]. overall, the selectivity analysis singled out  xxxg586xxx 
as the most different of the four cyp2c enzymes with amino acids
with distinct properties in positions 114ser, 205phe, and 476ile
compared to the other 2c enzymes. in addition, pocket b contains
variations of amino acids in different positions important for hydrophobicity, volume, and polarity. the regions related to  xxxg586xxx 
selectivity are ile102, phe201, val233, and val237.  xxxg584xxx  has
a selective region with val102, phe201, ile233, phe237, ile240 in

this b pocket region where  xxxg584xxx  is very divergent compared
to the other cyp enzymes. all of these amino acids except ile240
are seen in the flexible analysis. the third component, selective
against cyp2c9, has a selective region with leu102, leu201,
val237, met240, and val292 [46]. the middle region in the first
component that is selective for  xxxg586xxx  has a selective region including ile113, phe205, val296, and val366 in pocket a. the
flexible analysis shows that asn99, ile113 to phe114 in the bc
loop, phe205, leu208, and val296 are selective for  xxxg586xxx . from
the cpca differential plot in the second component for  xxxg584xxx 
discrimination, there are two selective regions: two regions close to
the leu205 that is ile in cyp2c9 and 2c19 and another region
close to ser99 that is a his in cyp2c19, an asn in  xxxg586xxx , and
an ile in cyp2c9 [46]. the third component is selective in the
region consisting of ile99, phe114, ile205, leu208, and glu300. an
inverse pharmacophore model for cyp2c9 was constructed from
the selective regions consisting of variables from the analysis of the
grid calculation with the dry probe and coo - probe. the model
is in agreement with the properties of the docked diclofenac molecule. the selective regions from the analysis, transformed into
pharmacophoric maps, could guide the synthesis of drugs with better pharmacokinetic properties and thus avoid cyp-mediated drugdrug interactions.
de groot et al. (2002) [47] have reported a 3d protein (homology) model with an imbedded pharmacophore for cyp2c9 to predict the potential site of metabolism in cyp2c9 substrates. the
authors employed a combination of pharmacophore modeling, homology modeling based on rabbit cyp2c5 structure and part of
bacterial cyp102 structure, and molecular orbital calculations for
intermediate and product identification. the crystal structure of
cyp2c5 was used as the template for the homology model, and the
b’-helical region of the crystal structure of cyp102 was used as
template for the cyp2c9 b’-region. the generated cyp2c9 pharmacophore model derived from 27 known substrates (fig. (2)) was
oriented in the active site of the cyp2c9 homology model using
sybyl without changing the orientations of the substrates relative
to each other [47]. the substrates were oriented with the site of
oxidation 3.03.5 å above the iron atom of the heme, with the
plane of the heme roughly perpendicular to the semiplanar region of
the pharmacophore model. the acidic group/hydrogen-bond acceptor group oriented toward the side chain of arg108, and the aromatic parts of the molecules oriented to enable an interaction with
phe476 while avoiding steric clashes with the other amino acids
lining the interior of the active site. as such, the pharmacophore
model fitted well into the protein model and the major features of
the developed model are steric, electronic, and chemical stability
properties [47]. other residues such as val113 and/or phe114 were
also involved in interactions with warfarin. the combined model
was in agreement with experimental data concerning the substrates
used to derive the model and data from site-directed mutagenesis
studies for cyp2c9. the model has been successfully used to predict the metabolism of four substrates not used to construct the
model [ xxxd358xxx , dibenzylfluorescein (dbf), 7-methoxy4(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (mfc) and sildenafil, fig. (2)]. the
model has also provided an explanation for the difference in substrate specificity between cyp2c9 and 2c19.
a further refined homology model of cyp2c9 based on rabbit
cyp2c5 structure has has been developed by lewis et al. (2003)
[48]. in this improved model, selective substrates of cyp2c9 fitted
well within the putative active site in a manner which is consistent
with data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments and known
sites of metabolism of cyp2c9 substrates [48].
zamora et al. (2003) [49] have reported a prediction tool for
cyp2c9 site of metabolism based on comparison between alignment-independent descriptors derived from grid molecular interaction fields (mifs) for the active site of cyp2c9 and a distance-

zhou et al.

based metric of the substrate.the tool was developed using a previously reported homology model of cyp2c9 based on the structure
of rabbit cyp2c5 [45]. three mifs were generated in the grid
analysis using the dry (hydrophobic probe), the n1 probe (amide
nitrogen hydrogen-bond donor), and the o probe (carbonyl oxygen
hydrogen-bond acceptor) with a grid step size of 1 å [49]. the
atoms in the cyp2c9 substrates were classified into three grid
categories depending on their hydrophobic (dry), hydrogen bond
donor (n1), or hydrogen bond acceptor (o) capabilities. the set of
87 validation reactions reported in the metabolite database (isis
base, metabolite database, mdl information systems inc., san
leandro, ca) includes 43 different substrates: 25 having one single
site of metabolism, three with two sites of metabolism, four presenting three sites of metabolism, and 11 having four sites of metabolism. this combination approach ranked all substrate hydrogen
atoms in order of likelihood of being located at the site of metabolism. in more than 90% of the 87 cyp2c9-catalyzed reactions investigated, the hydrogen atom ranked first, second, or third as the
known site of oxidation from experimental data [49]. this approach
would be of great help in designing new compounds with a better
pharmacokinetic profile, or in designing prodrugs where the compound needs to be metabolized in order to become active. this
methodology can predict the site of metabolism by cyp2c9 without the need for any time-consuming semiempirical or ab initio
computations. the method does not use any training set and has
been shown to be predictive for an extensive diverse validation set
of ligands.
3.1.2. pharmacophore models
the first pharmacophore model of cyp2c9 reported by jones
et al. (1993) [50] has suggested a hydrogen-bond donor or acceptor
within the active site. jones et al. (1996) [51] updated this model
using overlapped eight substrates to define a binding template
model for cyp2c9. the substrates included phenytoin,  xxxd990xxx ,
ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, 1-tetrahydrocannabinol (1-thc
or  xxxd1943xxx ), 58c80 (an antimalarial drug), and  xxxd3394xxx  (fig.
(3)). the potent selective inhibitor sulfaphenazole which is a tulbutamide analog was also included in this study. an initial hydrogen
bond donor site (n2) was identified on phenytoin (used as the template molecule) and corresponding hydrogen bond donation sites
were then identified on all of the molecules studied [51]. using
molecular modeling, the resultant model is described by the distance between the site of metabolism, and the hydrogen bond donor
heteroatom and the angle between this and the hydrogen bond [51].
this preliminary model indicated the distance and angle between
the site of metabolism and the site of the hydrogen bond donor was
6.7 å and 133°, respectively.
mancy et al. (1995) [52] have described a pharmacophore
model for cyp2c9 substrates using phenytoin and warfarin as templates and 10 additional tienilic acid derivatives (fig. (4)). among
these compounds, only the derivatives (i.e. compounds 5, 8 and 9)
containing an acidic function (carboxylic acids, phenol, and tetrazole whose pka values are 4.8, 6.3, and 3.8, respectively) underwent 5-hydroxylation of their thiophene ring similar to tienilic acid
(pka = 4.8) which was a good substrate of cyp2c9 with k m of 6
m and kcat of 2.4 min-1 [52]. despite their close structural analogy
with tienilic acid, all of the other compounds (compounds 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 and 7) did not undergo 5-hydroxylation of the thiophene ring and
failed to inhibit cyp2c9. the replacement of the cooh function
by a hydrogen atom (compound 6) or by other polar functions such
as cooch3, conh2, or ch2oh (compounds 2, 3, and 4, respectively) completely abolished the 5-hydroxylation of the corresponding derivative by cyp2c9.  xxxd3265xxx  (pka = 4.9), a 2aroylthiophene compound structurally similar to tienilic acid, was
also 5-hydroxylated by cyp2c9 with an 8-fold higher km and 3fold higher kcat compared to tienilic acid. only those 2aroylthiophenes containing a negative charge at ph 7.4 on a para

fig. (5). chemical structures of sulfaphenazole and its derivatives. mancy et al. (1996) [53] have updated their previous pharmacophore model for cyp2c9
using these twelve sulfaphenazole analogues, with the inclusion of a hydrophobic zone between the hydroxylation site and the cationic site on the enzyme.

substituent of the aryl ring are 5-hydroxylated on their thiophene
ring by cyp2c9. these results strongly suggested that the presence
of a negative charge on a compound at ph 7.4 is a critical feature in
its recognition by cyp2c9.
this model superimposed the substrates using their sites of oxidation and brought all anionic heteroatoms in the substrates within
3.54.8 å of a hypothetical cationic interaction site within the
cyp2c9 protein [52]. the orientations of the anionic heteroatoms
differed between substrates, and a hydrogen bond to cyp2c9 was
thus considered to be unlikely. instead, a positively charged residue
bordering the substrate binding site was considered to interact electrostatically with the negative center on the substrate. the molecular
modelling study has suggested the site of hydroxylation is
7.8 å away from an anionic site, which is in turn 4 å from a cationic site on the protein, separated by an angle of 82.3° [52].
mancy et al. (1996) [53] have updated the above pharmacophore model using twelve sulfaphenazole analogues (fig. (5)),
with the inclusion of a hydrophobic zone between the hydroxylation
site and the cationic site on the protein. evidence for the importance
of an anionic site in the substrates was gaineds by site-directed
mutagenesis experiments highlighting the importance of arginine
residues (e.g. arg97 and arg108) within the cyp2c9 active site
[54].
nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and molecular modeling
have been combined to assist in defining the positioning of substrates in the cyp2c9 active site by poli-scaife et al. (1997) [55].
several substrates including tienilic acid, its isomer, a phenol derived from tienilic acid by loss of its ch2cooh function, lauric
acid and diclofenac and a potent inhibitor sulfaphenazole (fig. (6))
were used in this study. distances between the heme iron atom and
substrate protons were calculated from the nmr data, and the orientation of the substrate relative to iron was determined from those
distances. a model for substrate positioning in the cyp2c9 active

site was constructed by molecular modeling studies under the constraint of the iron-proton distances [55]. the anionic atoms of the
substrates were all within 4.0 å from a putative cationic site of the
protein. sulfaphenazole was easily included in this model, and a
positioning for both conformations led to a fen bond in which the
n- anionic site of sulfaphenazole was located at a distance from the
protein cationic site compatible with an ionic bond (3.7 å). in one
of the two starting conformations, the n-phenyl group of sulfaphenazole was well located in a hydrophobic region of the
cyp2c9 substrate envelope, and it was close to the dichlorophenyl
groups of the tienilic acid derivatives. the presence of a hydrophobic group on the  xxxd3045xxx  nitrogen atom of sulfaphenazole has been
found to be crucial for the potent inhibitory effect of this compound
on 2c9 [53]. the high affinity of sulfaphenazole for cyp2c9 is
owing to a third structural feature, the presence of its nh2 which
binds to the iron. overall, the model has suggested two structural
determinants for substrate recognition - an anionic site able to establish an ionic bond with a putative cationic residue of the protein and
a hydrophobic site between the substrate hydroxylation site and the
anionic site, which corresponds to the aryl group of tienilic acid
derivatives and the n-phenyl group of sulfaphenazole [55].
ekins et al. (2002) [56] have constructed several cyp2c9
competitive inhibitor-based pharmacophore and 3d- and 4d-qsar
models based on their own inhibition data using  xxxd3394xxx  and
diclofenac as probes and literature data using catalyst and pls
(partial least squares)-ms-whim (molecular surface-weighted
holistic molecular) approaches, respectively. catalyst is a commercially available 3d-qsar tool that generates a representative set of
conformers of molecules in a training set that accounts for the
maximum occupation of conformational space of chemical functionalities, while pls-ms-whim uses molecular surface-weighted
holistic invariant molecular descriptors of the size and shape of
inhibitors. the first pharmacophore model created by catalyst

fig. (7). chemical structures of nine compounds that inhibit cyp2c9. these compounds include ly213829, ly156735, ly300502, ly335979,  xxxd3279xxx ,
and ly333531,  xxxd2969xxx , phenytoin and clozapine, which have been used by ekins et al. (2000) [56] to construct a pharmacophore model.

diclofenac hydroxylation has demonstrated that four features were
needed for inhibition of cyp2c9, namely, two hydrophobes, one
hydrogen bond donor, and one hydrogen bond acceptor [56]. the
second pharmacophore model based on the ki values of 29 structurally similar cyp2c9 inhibitors against  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation
from published data [43] contained a hydrophobe, two hydrogen
bond donors, and one hydrogen bond acceptor. catalyst model
3 constructed using the published data with phenytoin analogues
and bistriazole antifungal agents gave an r value of 0.71 for three
pharmacophore features including one hydrophobe and two hydrogen bond acceptors. the overall shape of three cyp2c9 pharmacophore models were similar with the distances between a hydrogen
bond acceptor and a second hydrogen bond acceptor/donor being
3.4 to 5.7 å; a hydrophobic feature was positioned 3 to 5.8 å from
a hydrogen bond acceptor. all these pharmacophore models fit well
within the substrate template distances between residue contacts and
sites of oxidation of cyp2c9 as suggested from an alignment study
with the bacterial cypbm3/cyp102 [38]. models 1 and 2 were

used to predict ki values of a test set of 14 inhibitors (fig. (8)) and
the predicted inhibition potency for cyp2c9 correlated well with
experimentally observed inhibition data [56]. the inhibitor-based
models confirmed multiple interaction determinants necessary for
inhibitors (hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor/donor features) within the cyp2c9 active site. this is in agreement with
what is known about the substrates of cyp2c9 [55, 57]. it appears
that these substrate and inhibitor binding determinants may provide
an explanation for the atypical michaelis-menten kinetics for
naproxen demethylation [58] and dapsone n-hydroxylation [59]
where cyp2c9 was activated in both hetero- and homotropic activation manners.
jones et al. (1996) [43] failed to construct a significant 3dqsar model for the cyp2c9 ki model derived from inhibition of
 xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation as the q2 value was <0.3. however,
ekins et al. (2002) [56] described a pls ms-whim 4d-qsar
model with a q2 value of 0.64 using five components consisting of

the molecular surface properties of negative electrostatic potential,
hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobicity.
the 3d-qsar derived using pls ms-whim gave a q2 value
of 0.4 for eight of nine inhibitors with the weights negative potential
and hydrogen bond donor (ly333531 was excluded since either its
molecular size or flexibility exceeded the limit imposed by their
pls ms-whim method).
the pharmacophore model reported by de groot et al. (2002)
[47] has suggested to interact with arg108 for several compounds.
this model was derived using 31 metabolic pathways for 27 substrates with 58c80 (an antimalarial drug) and  xxxd192xxx  as template
molecules (fig. (2)). four known 2c9 substrates including  xxxd358xxx 
(an endothelin receptor antagonist), dbf, mfc and sildenafil were
used as the validation set of molecules. this is in line with the work
by ridderström et al. (2000) [54] which has suggested that arg108
is one of the important amino acids in the cyp2c9 active site,
which serves as the cationic site in the model reported by mancy et
al. (1995 & 1996) [52, 53].
berellini et al. (2005) [60] constructed a pharmacophore model
using 27 selective  xxxg99xxx  receptor at1 blockers (fig. (9)).
pls discriminant analysis was used to identify the chemical features responsible for the selectivity of at1 and  xxxg101xxx  an-

tagonists. for the most interesting sartans, 3d-qsar and adme
(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) models were
developed that allow both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics
profiling. candesartan shows two h-bond donor regions  xxxd1891xxx -å
distance that are important for at1 pharmacophore recognition
[60]. these pharmacophoric regions are present in all selective at 1
antagonists. however, one of the two regions is not present in irbesartan. in addition, candesartan shows two h-bond acceptor regions
separated by 18 å, which are due to the presence of tetrazolyl and
benzoimidazoyl groups. these interactions are also found in all
important at 1 selective compounds. in addition, a third requisite
with high importance for at1 recognition is generated by a hydrophobic region and a hydrogen bond donor region exhibiting a mutual distance of 34 å. metasite correctly predicts the hydroxylation of losartan resulting in its main active metabolite e-3174 as
 xxxd3295xxx  resulting in its metabolite enoltasosartan (fig. (10)) [60].
moreover, metasite predicts other sites of metabolism that in turn
produce other metabolites. all the main metabolites of candesartan,
 xxxd3487xxx , and  xxxd3295xxx  are also well predicted. this detailed information can be used by pharmaceutical scientists in an early
adme stage to increase the metabolic stability of drug candidates
or to select appropriate chemical modifications leading to a better
pharmacokinetics profile.

and dotted arrows, respectively.

3.1.3. comfa, comsia and qsar-based models
jones et al. (1996) [43] established the first ligand-based 3dqsar comparative molecular field analysis (comfa) model that
described 27 compounds (mostly coumarin derivatives, see (fig.
(11)) inhibiting cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation.
this model was derived by aligning phenyl rings, benzylic carbon
atoms, and attached hydrogen atoms within the molecules but not
the sites of oxidation. 9(s),11(r)-cyclocoumarol (compound 4) was
used as a template molecule, assuming the presence of an aromatic
binding region and a sterically forbidden region. this model has
shown the presence of at least one site of electrostatic interaction
between the enzyme and substrate, contributing to 57% of the
ligand-enzyme interactions [43]. this could indicate the presence of
a hydrogen bond donor in the active site of cyp2c9 that dictates
substrate orientation. this first cyp2c9 comfa model predicted
the binding affinity correctly for most compounds except compounds 10, 23, 27 and 29 that are relatively weak or strong inhibitors with large degrees of conformational freedom. notably, com-

pounds 1-6 and 14-21 show high affinity for cyp2c9, but are not
anionic at physiological ph. compounds 22, 23, 25-27 and 29 do
not have either an anion or a strong dipole in the anion binding
position.
the resultant model also enabled the refinement and construction of a homology model of the cyp2c9 active site based on the
bacterial cyp101 structure [43]. this model predicted an aromatic
binding site and two electrostatic interaction sites in the active site
of cyp2c9. the model interactions included the i helix, and
phenyl () binding site that centers the oxidation site of the substrate over the active oxygen species, the porphyrin that accommodates the underside of the coumarin analog, and at least one positive
charge donation site. combining this comfa-generated active site
model with an earlier homology model for cyp2c9 [34] yielded
the prediction that two residues, phe110 and phe114 may play a
role in binding aromatic ligands. the residue phe114, but not
phe110, as an important residue in the aromatic binding site, has
been confirmed by the site-directed mutagenesis study [57].

fig. (12). chemical structures of 14 additional compounds (mostly sulfonamides). rao et al. (2000) [41] have refined a previously developed ligand-based
comfa model [43] with these additional compounds with starting geometries derived from calculations within a homology model of cyp2c9.

he et al. (1999) [61] have revealed that the ring closed form of
 xxxd990xxx  and the ring opened anionic form of s- xxxd2911xxx 
are the major and specific structural forms of the two substrates that
interact with the active site of cyp2c9. the fact that  xxxd990xxx 
and s- xxxd2911xxx  interact with cyp2c9 in different structural
states provides an explanation for the significant differences in their
metabolic profiles. moreover, in accord with a previously established comfa model [43], these results are consistent with the
hypothesis that the active site of cyp2c9 possesses at least two
major substrate binding sites, a -stacking site for aromatic rings
and an ionic binding site for organic anions. an additional electrostatic binding site also appears to contribute to the orientation of
coumarin analogs in the cyp2c9 active site by interacting with the
c2-carbonyl group of the coumarin nucleus.

inhibiting  xxxd990xxx  metabolism with starting geometries derived
from calculations within a homology model of cyp2c9 based on
the structures of bacterial p450 bm3, cam and eryf. these compounds are mostly sulfonamides with only one of them being a
coumarin (fig. (12)). the initial model predicted the ki values of 13
of the 14 compounds correctly, and inclusion of these extra compounds did not change this model remarkably. to align the comfa
field in the homology model, cyclocoumarol was placed with the 7
position of the coumarin ring over the heme since this is the known
region of metabolism. the comfa field was then visualized in the
active site of the protein. this has suggested that phe110 and
phe114 might be involved in aromatic interactions and that
arg105and asp293 (possibly through a bridging water molecule)
could be responsible for electrostatic interactions [41].

els and 3d contour plots for cyp2c9 using a panel of benzbromarone analogues including compounds 2-17 (fig. (13)). as evidence of the importance of the anion, the affinity of analogues with
the acidic phenol hydrogen replaced with a methyl group (compound 17) or with a pka above 8.3 (compound 16) was markedly
decreased. the most potent 2c9 inhibitor, 2-methyl-3-(3,5-diiodo-

4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzofuran (compound 11), was characterized to
have a ki of 1.0 nm against  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation. this suggests
small side chains on the benzofuran ring and the halogens providing
steric bulk or hydrophobicity enhance the binding affinity. further
studies using compounds 2-10 have revealed that most of these new
compounds have affinities lower than the original eight with some

ki values reaching into the low micromolar range [62], but many of
the ki values are not far from that of sulfaphenazole (200300
nm). comfa suggested electrostatics contributes 4046% and
sterics contributes 5460% to the affinity of the benzbromarone
analogues. three of the new analogues, compounds 2-4, are better
isosteres of benzbromarone that contain bulky groups adjacent to
the phenol and have increased pka values. when benzbromarone
was reduced to an alcohol (3), the absence of ketone increased the
pka of the phenol. the benzyl derivative (4) placed a methylene
carbon between the ketone and phenol ring, thereby insulating the
phenol from the ketone. the major difference with these compounds is the preservation of the favorable bulky groups adjacent to
the phenol. three additional benzbromarone analogues suggest that
cyp2c9 contains a hydrophobic region near the benzoyl ring,
which is the location of the aromatic interaction site. analogue 5
possesses a simple cyclohexane moiety attached to the ketone with
a ki lower than the ki values of several containing an aromatic ring.
the dimethyl phenol methyl ether (6) and the 4”-dimethylamino
analogue (7) have affinities similar to that of the methyl ether (15)
and may make van der waals contacts with their bulky substituents.
moving a methoxy group from the favorable c4” (17) to the c2”
position (9) decreased the affinity for 2c9. the three poor binders,
derivatives 8, 9 and 10 all lack a substituent at c4”, indicating a
specific steric requirement at the 3”5” positions of the aromatic
benzoyl ring. comsia models predict that these bulky groups are
favorable for their hydrophobicity, while a negative charge is favored at the ketone oxygen rather than the phenol oxygen [62]. the
overlap of this ketone with electronegative groups of other cyp2c9
substrates suggests they act as key positive charge acceptors. specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute the most
to the ligand specificity of cyp2c9.
suzuki et al. (2004) [63] constructed comfa models for both
cyp2c9 and 2c19 using a series of phenytoin, nirvanol, and barbiturate derivatives (fig. (14)) that inhibited s- cyp2c9-mediated
 xxxd2141xxx  4’-hydroxylation and cyp2c19-mediated 3-omethylfluorescein o-demethylation. in each series, n-3 alkylation
with progressively larger side chains resulted in increased inhibitor
potency, suggesting that lipophilicity is a major determinant of
cyp2c19 inhibition with these congeners. structures of 24 inhibitors were aligned with superimposition of the n-3, c-4, and c-5
positions of the heterocyclic rings. the alignment rules dictated that
the c-5 phenyl group on the r-nirvanol analogs projected in one
direction, and the corresponding phenyl group on the s-nirvanols
projected approximately 110° away [63]. the alkyl substituent
groups at the n-3 position in each series were superimposed as
closely as possible, given the different geometries of the optimized
structures. inhibitor stereochemistry did not markedly affect k i

towards cyp2c9, and logp adequately predicted inhibitor potency
for this enzyme [63]. this indicates that non-specific solvation effects are responsible for the differences in cyp2c9 binding with
this series of compounds. in contrast, for cyp2c19 a threedimensional predictor is required to describe the stereo-selective
effects. it is clear that the inhibitory potency of the n-3 alkyl analogs of phenytoin, nirvanol, and phenobarbital, against either enzyme, is primarily a function of the degree of lipophilic character at
the n-3 position. most of the inhibitors exhibited an increase in
binding affinity to both enzymes with increasing steric bulk in each
series [63]. this result is consistent with a general entropic effect
associated with solvation; the increased ordering of bulk water by
the larger substrates favoring binding of those substrates [64].
metabolic profiling and homology modeling studies have suggested
that the two highest affinity inhibitors, s-n-3-benzylnirvanol and rn-3-benzylphenobarbital, are preferentially bound in the active site
of cyp2c19 with their c-5 phenyl groups oriented towards the
active oxygen and n-3 benzyl groups bound within a lipophilic
pocket comprised by ala103, val113, phe114, val208, ile362,
leu366, and phe476. these are conserved residues in cyp2c9 and
2c19 with the exception of val208, which is leu208 in cyp2c9
and ile362 which is leu362 in cyp2c9. presumably the increased
binding affinity of the bulkier compounds in each series to either
cyp2c9 or cyp2c19 is a result of the enhanced lipophilicity of
the substituents at the n-3 position that increases interaction with
this lipophilic/aromatic binding region. inhibitor binding to
cyp2c19, but not cyp2c9, was highly stereoselective.
lewis et al. (2006) [65] investigated the qsars within a series
of cyp2c9 inhibitors. the lipophilicity of compounds, in the form
of logp values, is an important factor in explaining the variation in
inhibitory potency within these series of compounds. many of these
2c9 inhibitors also are substrates for the enzymes. in addition, hydrogen bonding and - stacking interaction play an important role
in the binding of these compounds to the active site of cyp2c9.
3.2. data from site-directed mutagenesis studies
gotoh (1992) [66] has identified six srss in cyp2c9 and other
2c members based on sequence alignments with bacterial
p450cam/cyp101 and analysis of mutations which cause changes
in substrate specificity. these six srss span amino acid residues
96–117, 198–205, 233–240, 286–304, 359–369 and 470–477 of
cyp2c9, respectively. data from studies with chimeric proteins
and site-directed mutagenesis have suggested that the substrate
specificity of cyp2c9 may be determined by a few critical residues
or even a single amino acid within srss. for example, the
ile359leu mutation in srs5 of cyp2c9 signficantly decreased the

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

hydroxylation of  xxxd3394xxx  (pka = 5.4), phenytoin (pka = 8.1)
and  xxxd990xxx  (pka = 5.1) but not that of diclofenac (pka = 4.5)
[67, 68]. the ile359leu mutant exhibited a 5-fold lower v max and a
5-fold higher k m for  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation compared to the
wild-type protein [68].

of the active site but are part of the i-helix interacting with the b’region and are probably involved in the stabilization of these regions relative to each other. further site-directed mutagenesis studies by wada et al. (2008) [73] have confirmed that the residue
ser286 is important for conferring cyp2c9 substrate specificity.

the allelic variant that has cys144 instead of arg144 resulted
in impaired metabolism of  xxxd990xxx  by cyp2c9 [69]. this amino
acid is on the surface of the protein, and it has been suggested that it
disrupts a reductase contact point [38]. the allelic variant leu359
(instead of ile359) responsible for a lower v max for the metabolism
of  xxxd990xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  is also not in direct contact with the
active-site region [70]. cyp2c9 mutations of ile99, pro220, and
thr221 to the equivalent residues in cyp2c19 (his99, ser220, and
pro221) conferred omeprazole activity onto cyp2c9 [71].

haining et al. (1999) [57] have introduced mutations guided by
homology modeling and comfa analysis at key residues located in
the putative loop region between helices b’ and c of cyp2c9. the
phe110leu, phe110tyr, val113leu, and phe114lys mutants, but
not the phe114tyr mutant, expressed stably at comparable levels as
the wild-type and the purified proteins were active toward lauric
acid, a substrate of cyp2c9. the val113leu mutant metabolized
neither r- nor  xxxd990xxx , and the phe114leu mutant alone displayed altered metabolite profiles for the warfarin enantiomers [57].
significant metabolism occurred on the putative c9 phenyl anchor,
at the 4’-position of r- and  xxxd990xxx . in addition, the vmax for swarfarin 7-hydroxylation decreased 4-fold and the km was increased 13-fold by the phe114leu mutation, whereas kinetic parameters for  xxxd1921xxx  metabolism, a substrate which cannot bind
the enzyme by a - stacking interaction, were not markedly affected by this mutation [57]. in addition, the phe114leu mutant, but
not phe110leu, increased the ki of sulfaphenazole 100-fold for
inhibition of cyp2c9-catalyzed oxidation of  xxxd990xxx , diclofenac, and  xxxd1921xxx  compared to the wild-type enzyme (60100 vs 0.32-1.1 m). these results support a role for b’c helix
loop residues phe114 and val113 in the hydrophobic interaction of
 xxxd990xxx  with cyp2c9, and are consistent with the finding that
there is -stacking to the aromatic residue phe114 for certain aromatic ligands.

since sulfephenazole is a potent and selective inhibitor of
cyp2c9 without effect on cyp2c19, jung et al. (1998) [26] constructed a series of cyp2c9/2c19 chimeric proteins to identify the
sequence differences responsible for such a difference in sulfaphenazole binding. the cyp2c9/2c19 hybrid protein containing
the first 338 n-terminal amino acids of 2c9 exhibited high-affinity
binding to sulfaphenazole, whereas the hybrid containing only the
first 227 amino acids of cyp2c9 had a very low affinity for sulfaphenazole. replacement of residues 227338 in cyp2c19 by the
respective region of cyp2c9 yielded high-affinity binding for sulfaphenazole (ks = 4 gm) that was not observed when a shorter
fragment (residues 227282) of cyp2c9 was substituted (ks >100
m) [26]. however, replacement of residues 283338 or 283-291
in cyp2c19 with respective fragments in cyp2c9 resulted in extremely low holoenzyme expression in escherichia coli (<20 vs 400
nmol p450/l in wild-type). an alignment of amino acids of varous
cyps has implied a possible ion pairing and hydrogen bond interaction between residues glu288 and asn289 in helix i of cyp2c9
and residue lys241 in helix g. replacement of glu241 by lys
recovered the stable expression of the chimeric protein that exhibited a ks of 8 gm for sulfaphenazole binding [26]. systematic replacement of the remaining differing amino acids revealed that two
amino acid substitutions in cyp2c19 (asn286ser and ile289asn)
confered high-affinity binding for sulfaphenazole with a ks of 4
gm. when combined with a third mutation, glu241lys, the resultant cyp2c19 triple mutant exhibited a high cataltyic activity toward  xxxd990xxx  with the stereo- and regiospecificity of 2c19 and a
lower km for  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation (7-9 gm) typical characteristic of cyp2c9. these results indicate that residues upstream of
amino acid 228 in cyp2c9 are important for the regiospecificity
and stereospecificity of warfarin metabolism. in addition, sulfaphenazole did not show significant inhibition to cyp2c19mediated  xxxd990xxx  metabolism but the ic50 was 15 m when the
triple mutant (glu241lys, asn286ser and ile289asn) was incubated with  xxxd990xxx .
site-directed mutagenesis studies have suggested the importance of the i-helix residues ser286 and asn289 of cyp2c9 for
conferring specificity for the substrates diclofenac and ibuprofen
[72]. a cyp2c19 chimera containing residues 228-340 of cyp2c9
conferred both diclofenac hydroxylation and 2- and 3-hydroxylation
of ibuprofen. the regiospecificity of this construct for metabolism
of ibuprofen differed from that of cyp2c9 by favoring 2hydroxylation over 3-hydroxylation [72]. on the other hand, a
cyp2c9 construct containing residues 228-340 of cyp2c19
lacked both diclofenac and ibuprofen hydroxylase activities. a
single ile289asn mutation conferred a dramatic increase in diclofenac hydroxylation and a small increase in ibuprofen 2hydroxylation. a second mutation (asn286ser and ile289asn)
increased diclofenac hydroxylation and conferred a dramatic increase in ibuprofen 2-hydroxylation [72]. a val288glu mutation
did not increase activity toward either substrate but decreased activity toward the two substrates in combination with the ile289asn or
the asn286ser, ile289asn mutants [72]. these residues are not part

substitution of arg97 with ala increased the km for diclofenac
4’-hydroxylation, whereas mutation of arg105 had no effect on
diclofenac metabolism [54]. however, other studies have suggested
that both arg97 and arg105 are key cationic residues in the active
site of cyp2c9 [40, 41]. arg97 is not predicted to be in the active
site by either homology modeling using cyp102 or the rabbit
cyp2c5 crystal structure [54]. mutation of arg108 to ala decreased the formation of 4’-hydroxydiclofenac 100-fold compared
with the wild-type [54], indicating another potential anionic binding
site, although arg108 is not in the active site in a homology model
based on the crystal structure of bacterial cyp102. however,
arg108 is an essential part of the cyp2c9 active site in the homology model based on rabbit 2c5 structure by de groot et al. (2002)
[47].
flanagan et al. (2003) [42] have reported that replacement of
asp293 of cyp2c9 in helix i with ala (asp293ala) decreased
activity by more than 90%, and resulted in 3- to 10-fold increase in
km values for  xxxd3394xxx , dextromethorphan (a cyp2d6 substrate
containing a basic nitrogen) and diclofenac. these effects are
greater for the carboxylate-containing diclofenac (500-fold decrease
in kcat value; 11-fold increase in km value) than for the sulphonamide  xxxd3394xxx  (11-fold decrease in kcat value; 5-fold increase in
km value), whereas the o-demethylation of dextromethorphan was
less affected (6-fold decrease in kcat value; 3-fold increase in k m
value) [42]. conservative replacement of the carboxyl side chain in
a glu (asp293glu) mutant did not significantly change km values
and only slightly increased kcat values (1.4- to 1.8-fold). decreased
dextromethorphan o- and n-demethylation were observed in the
asp293ala mutant compared to the wild-type enzyme, whereas
increased preference for o-demethylation over n-demethylation
was found for the asp293glu mutant. the asp293asn and
asp293gln mutations failed to form a p450 [42]. these results
suggest a structural role for the carboxyl side chain of asp293 in
cyp2c9 substrate binding and catalysis. the residue asp290 in
rabbit cyp2c5 (corresponding to asp293 in cyp2c9) is located in
helix i, with its side chain forming a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide between ile112 and ala113 (val113 in cyp2c9) in
the b’-c loop. this loop, along with the loop between helices f and

3496 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

g, defines a substrate access channel and forms part of ‘substrate
recognition sequence 1’ [74] as defined by gotoh [66]. the removal
of the  xxxd2154xxx  and the resulting loss of the interactions with
the b’-c loop in the asp293ala mutant may alter the position or
mobility of this loop, causing an indirect effect on substrate binding. in addition, mutations at the corresponding asp301 in cyp2d6
have been found to decrease protein stability [75]. the aspartate
residue, equivalent to asp293 of cyp2c9, is conserved in cyps
from other families, which have a wide range of substrate preferences. this residue appears to play a key role in maintaining the
structural integrity of the active site, specifically the position of the
b’-c loop of this family of enzymes.
melet et al. (2003) [76] have revealed that the ser365ala mutant exhibited kinetic characteristics for the 5-hydroxylation of
tienilic acid similar to those of cyp 2c9. however, this mutant was
not inhibited by tienilic acid in a mechanism-based manner, indicating that the oh group of ser365 could be the nucleophile forming a
covalent bond with an electrophilic metabolite of tienilic acid in the
inactivation of cyp2c9. the phe114ile mutant was inactive toward
the hydroxylation of diclofenac. the high affinity of sulfaphenazole
to cyp2c9 was completely lost when the phenyl substituent of
phe114 was replaced with the alkyl group of ile, or when the
phenyl substituent of sulfaphenazole was replaced with a cyclohexyl group [76]. however, this cyclohexyl derivative of sulfaphenazole interacted with the phe114ile mutant. at the opposite
end, the phe94leu and phe110ile mutants showed properties very
similar to those of cyp2c9 toward tienilic acid and diclofenac
[76]. in addition, the phe476ile mutant caused a significant change
in the kcat and km values for tienilic acid and diclofenac hydroxylation. this mutant showed a 37-fold increase of the ki value for the
inhibition of cyp2c9 by sulfaphenazole and an altered regioselectivity of diclofenac hydroxylation [76]. these data indicate
that phe114 plays an important role in recognition of aromatic substrates of cyp2c9, presumably via - stacking interaction;
phe476 also plays a crucial role in substrate recognition and hydroxylation by cyp2c9.
davies et al. (2004) [77] have further revealed that arg97 but
not lys72 in cyp2c9 plays a role in the stability of cyp2c9. mutation of arg97 led to a loss of holoenzyme expression for
arg97ala, arg97val, arg97leu, arg97thr, and arg97glu mutants. low levels of hemoprotein were detected for arg97gln,
arg97lys, arg97ile, and arg97pro mutants. significant apoenzyme was observed, suggesting that heme insertion or protein stability was compromised in arg97 mutants. however, all lys72
mutants examined (lys72glu, lys72gln, lys72val, and
lys72leu) could be expressed as hemoprotein at levels comparable
to wild-type.
cyp2c9 and 2c19 possess conserved phe114 and phe476 residues in srs-1 and srs-6, respectively, and mutations at these sites
significantly affect warfarin and diclofenac metabolism by cyp2c9
[57, 76]. mosher et al. (2008) [78] further examined the importance
of phe100, phe114, and phe476 in ligand binding, metabolism, and
orientation within the cyp2c9 active site. phe residues were mutated singly and doubly, to leu or trp, to modulate steric bulk and
aromaticity, respectively, to investigate the effect on spectral binding, steady-state turnover kinetics, and metabolite profiles. the
phe100leu mutation had minor effects on substrate binding and
metabolism of  xxxd990xxx  and s- xxxd2141xxx  [78]. however, the
phe114leu and phe476leu mutants exhibited substantially reduced
 xxxd990xxx  metabolism and altered hydroxy metabolite profiles but
only moderately decreased s- xxxd2141xxx  4’-hydroxylation while
maintaining product regio-selectivity [78]. the phe114trp and
phe476trp mutations also had opposing effects on  xxxd990xxx  vs sflurbiprofen 4’-hydroxylation. the phe476trp mutant increased the
efficiency of  xxxd990xxx  metabolism 5-fold, but decreased the efficiency of s- xxxd2141xxx  4’-hydroxylation 20-fold [78]. 4-

zhou et al.

hydroxylation was a more prominent  xxxd990xxx  metabolite in
phe476leu, the phe114leu/phe476leu double mutant, and the
phe114trp, phe476trp, and phe114trp/phe476trp mutants as
well. notably, the two trp476-containing mutants formed 7- and 6hydroxywarfarin in a 7:1 ratio [78]. these functional data show that
mutations at both the phe114 and phe476 positions alter the catalytic orientation of  xxxd990xxx  in the cyp2c9 active site. these
results indicate that both phe114 and phe476, but not phe100, in the
active site of cyp2c9 are important to the catalytic binding and
turnover of s- xxxd2141xxx  and  xxxd990xxx . the similarity in the
effects of the phe100leu, phe114leu, phe114trp, and phe476leu
mutants on catalytic efficiency toward  xxxd990xxx  and sflurbiprofen indicates that these two ligands share several of the
same binding determinants during catalytic turnover. however, the
opposing effects of the phe476trp mutant on  xxxd990xxx  and sflurbiprofen turnover suggest that their binding modes are not completely superimposable.
mosher et al. (2009) [79] have recently found that the
phe100leu and phe114trp mutants exhibited 4- to 5-fold increases
in catalytic efficiency, whereas the phe100trp, phe114leu,
phe476leu, and phe476trp mutants lost >90% of their phenytoin
hydroxylation capacity. this pattern of effects differs substantially
from that found previously for  xxxd990xxx  and s- xxxd2141xxx  metabolism, suggesting that these three ligands bind within discrete
orientations in the active site of cyp2c9. only the phe114leu,
phe476leu, and leu208val mutants altered phenytoin’s orientation
during catalytic turnover. the leu208val mutant also uniquely
demonstrated enhanced 6-hydroxylation of  xxxd990xxx  [79]. these
latter data provide the first experimental evidence for a role of the
f-g loop region in dictating the catalytic orientation of substrates
within the cyp2c9 active site.
3.3. crystal structural features of cyp2c9
the first crystal structure of human cyp2c9 refined to a 2.55å resolution has been resolved by williams et al. (2003) [30]. currently, there are three x-ray structures of the human cyp2c9 in
protein database (pdb): one ligand-free protein (1og2), and two
in complex with  xxxd990xxx  (1og5) or  xxxd2141xxx  (1r9o)
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/, access date: 27 may 2009) [30, 80]. to
gain the cyp2c9 structure, williams et al. (2003) [30] have removed the membrane n-terminal anchoring region and linked a
four-his tag to the c-terminus. the molecule used to obtain the
1og2 and 1og5 structures was a chimeric enzyme containing
seven mutations in the f/g-loop including lys206glu, ile215val,
cys216tyr, ser220pro, pro221ala, ile222leu, and ile223leu [30].
the published structures of 1og2 and 1og5 [30] differ in
comparison with 1r9o [80] in residues 30–53 of n-termini, residues 97–121 of b/c-loops, and residues 196–233 of helix f and
f/g-loops. these differences accounted for approximately one
quadrant of the structure. mutations of ser220pro and pro221ala in
the structures of 1og2 and 1og5 may stabilize the helix f’–g’
region [80], which has also been applied in the structures of human
 xxxg586xxx  [81, 82] and rabbit cyp2c5 [83]. these regions are some
of the most flexible in cyp2c9 and thus residues 214–220 in the
f/g-loop could not be resolved in the 1r9o structure due to low
electron density [80]. in addition, there are remarkable differences
in the region around the b’-helix consisting of residues 90–130,
probably due to the high flexibility of the f/g-loop. in the 1r9o
structure reported by wester et al. [80], the f/g loop contacts this
region in the most flexible part of residues 105–106. in addition to
seven amino acid mutations, 4 histidine tags had been added to the
1og5 structure [30]. however, there were no mutations introduced
into the catalytic domain of the protein for 1r9o except for that it
contained two terminal modifications: one on c-terminus extended
by a 4-residue histidine tag and another on n-terminal transmembrane domain which has been removed [80].

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

cyp2c9 is a two-domain protein with typical fold characteristics of the cyps [30] whose structures have been reported previously. the b-c loop forms part of the active site and contributes to
substrate specificity, with the phe114ile mutant being unable to
catalyze diclofenac hydroxylation and the high affinity of sulfaphenazole to cyp2c9 being completely lost when the phenyl
moiety of phe114 was replaced with the alkyl group of ile or when
the phenyl substituent of sulfaphenazole was replaced with a cyclohexyl group [76]. in the structures of cyp2c9 without ligand
bound or with bound  xxxd990xxx , residues 101-106 in the b-c loop
form helix b’ [30]. in addition, residues 212–222 in the f–g loop
form helices f’ and g’, which was not observed in rabbit cyp2c5
[84] and bacterial cyps [31]. the haem group is positioned between helices i and l and the iron is pentacoordinated with cys435.
as in other cyp structures, a water molecule located 7 å above the
haem iron is hydrogen bonded to thr301 which is highly conserved
and considered to play a role in the proton transfer process during
catalytic cycle [39].
in the 1og2 and 1og5 structures, the haem is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the propionates and the side chains of
trp120, arg124, his368 and arg433 [30]. in addition, arg97 forms
hydrogen bonds to the propionates as well as the carbonyl oxygen
atoms of val113 and pro367. replacement of arg97 with ala resulted in a 13-fold higher km for diclofenac hydroxylation compared to the wild-type enzyme [54]. arg 97 appears to contribute to
haem stabilization only instead of substrate interaction as suggested
previously [47, 54].
cyp2c9 shows a selectivity for the oxidation of relatively
small, lipophilic anions such as ibuprofen,  xxxd2141xxx , diclofenac
and gemfiborzil as substrates. as such, it hass been hypothesized
that a basic residue in the active site of cyp2c9 facilitates the
binding of these anionic substrates [47, 51-53, 55]. however, the
structures of 1og1 and 1og5 did not provide evidence for the
presence of such as basic residue despite of the presence of a number of hydrophobic residues within the active site cavity [30]. the
active site cavity of cyp2c9 extends up and away from helix i,
with phe114 and phe476 located on opposite sides of the channel,
and the very top of the channel being formed by helix b’ and the bc and f-g loops. it is difficult to understand why cyp2c9 has a
relatively large volume of the active site cavity (470 å3) but
shows remarkable selectivity toward small lipophilic anions.
phe114 points into the active site and is positioned to result in interactions with substrates as implicated by in vitro site-directed
mutagenesis studies [71]. phe69, phe100, leu102, leu208, leu362,
leu366 and phe476 generate a hydrophobic patch in the active site
while arg105 and arg108, previously implicated in the formation
of the putative anionic-binding site, both point away from the cavity
[30]. in contrast to the putative basic residues, two acidic residues,
asp293 and glu300, are present in the active site of cyp2c9.
asp293 is close to phe110 and phe114, and forms a hydrogen bond
to the backbone nitrogen of ile112 and consequently is well ordered, whereas glu300 points into the active site but shows some
flexibility in the ligand-free structure 1og1. in addition, both
gln214 and asn217 are near phe476 and may provide potential
hydrogen-bonding interactions with ligands. the human cyp2c9
and 2c19 differ by 43 residues out of 490, and of these there is only
one non-conservative substitution within the active site at residue
99 which is ile in cyp2c9 but his in 2c19. in contrast to cyp2c9,
2c19 does not display a significant selectivity for acidic anions
[85]. due to the absence of a basic residue in the active site of
cyp2c9, other functionally important residues may provide an
explanation for the substrate differences between these two enzymes.
in the 1og5 structure,  xxxd990xxx  was docked into the active
site of cyp2c9 which was highly hydrophobic and formed by
arg97, gly98, ile99, phe100, leu102, ala103, val113, phe114,
asn217, thr364, ser365, leu366, pro367 and phe476 [30]. the

phenyl group of  xxxd990xxx  packs against the side chains of phe476
and phe100 and also contacts pro367, resulting in - interaction
with the phenyl ring of  xxxd990xxx . the important role of many of
these residues in substrate interactions have been confirmed in sitedirected mutagenesis studies [57]. haining et al. (1999) [57] have
found that the val113leu mutant did not metabolize r- and swarfarin, and the phe114leu mutant showed altered metabolite
profiles for the warfarin enantiomers with significant metabolism
occurring at the 4’-position of r- and  xxxd990xxx .
the long i helix extending through the entire cyp structure
contained a kink in the surrounding area of the heme cofactor of the
crystal structures of 1og2, 1og5 and 1r9o [30, 80]. a water molecule was positioned in the helix kink. the helix-kink region is one
of the most conserved regions in the cyp family, and is considered
to serve as the proton transfer groove with a unified superfamily
motif ‘astgastgdeqntastg’ [86]. this region, which
includes a conserved thr301 in human cyp2c9, thr303 in human
 xxxd851xxx  [87], thr302 in rabbit 2b4 [88], thr306 in  xxxg573xxx  [89], and
thr252 in bacterial cyp101 [90], may be important for the appropriate orientation of an oxygen molecule in the axial position over
heme and may assist in proton transfer during the catalytic cycle
[91]. substitution of the highly conserved thr with ala has been
shown to alter kinetic parameters due to disruption of proton transfer process [87, 89, 90].
the position of the  xxxd990xxx  molecule places the potential site
of hydroxylation about 10 å from the heme iron in the 1og5 structure [30]. this large distance makes the  xxxd990xxx -1og5 binding
being in a non-productive orientation. the proper distance for hydroxylation is 3 å as observed with 1r9o in complex with  xxxd2141xxx  [92]. the  xxxd2141xxx  molecule was found to position
above heme and its hydroxylation site was 4.5 å away from the
central heme fe atom. non-productive binding of  xxxd990xxx  in
1og5 may represent an alternative binding mode to the productive
mode, and alternatively, the active site cavity of cyp2c9 may accommodate two molecules simultaneously [30].
however, the two terminal modifications merely facilitated purification and structural determination of the catalytic domains of
the truncated enzyme without impact on the active site in the 1r9o
structure [80]. the  xxxd2141xxx  in the active site of cyp2c9
(1r9o) was positioned at a reasonable distance (4.9 å) from the
iron to facilitate hydroxylation (fig. (15)) [80]. a relative small
structure encompassed the active site cavity in the 1r9o construct.
most importantly, the 1r9o structure reveals that the basic arg108
residue points into the active site and is able to interact with the
negatively charged lipophilic substrate, such as naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, and gemfibrozil [80]. this structure
is in accordance with several experimental observations that were
difficult to rationalize based on the 1og5 structure.
notably, the binding of  xxxd990xxx  to cyp2c9 (1og5) does not
induce major conformational changes within the protein, but some
local rearrangements are observed [30]. for example, the complexed  xxxd990xxx  has slightly displaced the loop containing residues 474-478 by 0.5–1.5 å. the side chain of phe476, which
showed conformational mobility in the ligand-free structure, produces a - stacking interaction with the phenyl group of swarfarin. the bicyclic scaffold of  xxxd990xxx  also makes van der
waals contact with the side chains of ala103, phe114 and pro367.
hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between carbonyl
oxygen atoms of  xxxd990xxx  and backbone amide nitrogen atoms of
phe100 and ala103.
the crystal structures of the cyp2c9 provide insights into the
ligand-cyp interaction. however, the differences in the active sites
of the two crystal structures of cyp2c9 may not only reflect conformational flexibility of the protein but also present challenge to
understand the structure determinants of substrate oxidation. most

(15). crystal structures of human cyp2c9 (a, pdb id: ir9o) in complex with different substrates including celecoxib (b), diclofenac (c), sflurbiprofen (d), tamoxifen (e), and  xxxd990xxx  (f). the productive orientations give a distance of 2.64-5.14 å between the oxidative site and central heme fe
atom. arg108, leu205, asp293, and asn474 are all involved in the binding of these substrates to the active site of cyp2c9.

likely, the structure of cyp2c9- xxxd2141xxx  complex (1r9o) is
more reasonable than that of cyp2c9-warfarin complex (1og5)
for the explanation of substrate specificity of cyp2c9.
3.4. studies based on the published cyp2c9 structures
recently, sykes et al. (2008) [93] used the molecular alignment
program rocs with the query compound  xxxd2141xxx  (i.e. guide
structure) as a basis to predict the active site orientation of the
cyp2c9 substrates from a database which comprised 70 molecules.
the combination score was used as the overlay score of choice,
since both shape and chemical features (e.g. hydrophobic fragments, rings, anionic and cationic moieties, hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors, etc) are important determinants for binding in the
active site of cyp2c9. the vida program was employed to analyze and visualize the rocs results and to calculate the distance
from the 4’-hydroxylation site of  xxxd2141xxx  to the site of
cyp2c9 metabolism for each database molecule. the results
showed that 39 of the first 44 molecules (89%) sorted by rocs
combination score had alignments that could explain the experimentally observed site of oxidation when a threshold rocs combo

score of 0.99 was proposed as a “reliability” cutoff [93]. safrole,
limonene, and methyl eugenol, which had rocs combination
scores of 0.91 or less, are all neutral, relatively small molecules that
would not be expected to interact with the amino acid residues in
cyp2c9 such as arg108, asn289, and asp293. another class of
molecules that are metabolized by cyp2c9 but have little structural
similarity to  xxxd2141xxx  are the relatively large tertiary amines
including amitriptyline, clozapine, zopiclone, hydromorphone, and
 xxxd3398xxx . the authors have suggested that these cyp2c9 substrates require a different molecular scaffold to facilitate their
alignments based on the site of metabolism in cyp2c9 [93].
the authors further investigated the proximity of the sites of
metabolism to the heme iron in the 39 successfully aligned
cyp2c9 substrates with a rocs combination score >0.99 [93].
the average distance from the site of oxidation to iron heme was
determined to be 5.21 å, with 32 molecules in the 4–6 å, 4 between 6 and 7 å, 2 < 4 å, and 1 > 7 å. these data are in agreement
with previously observed substrate-heme distances of 6.2 å, 3.3–
4.4 å, and 4.7–4.9 å for mammalian and fish cyp1a-mediated
reactions for 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p) [94].

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

3499

fig. (16). illustration of the binding of different substrates of cyp2c9 to the active site of human cyp2c9 (pdb id: ir9o). the substrates include safrole
(a), methyleugenol (b), galangin (c), kaempferol (d), limonene (e) and  xxxd3545xxx  (f). the productive orientations give a distance of 3.88-4.57 å between
the oxidative site and central heme fe atom except for kaempferol (8.78 å). arg108, leu205, asp293, and asn474 are all involved in the binding of these
substrates to the active site of cyp2c9.

molecular docking studies were also performed using the
fred program based on the 1r9o crystal structure on the unaligned database of cyp2c9 molecules [93]. overall, the results
were relatively poor compared to those using the rocs-based
alignment approach. the best docking results were gained with the
plp scoring function, with 31 of the first 44 molecules selected
correctly aligned in the cyp2c9 active site. the various other scoring functions yielded less successful results, ranging from 22 of 44
for shapegauss to 30 of 44 for chemscore [93]. this reflects that the
rocs ligand-based approach gave superior results to the combined
protein-docking approach. notably, the four thioether pesticides
including phorate, disulfoton, sulprofos, and methiocarb which are
“atypical” substrates of cyp2c9 were orientated into to the active
site that facilitated oxidation using the plp scoring function. aromatic -stacking interactions with phe114 are likely to be important
for both of these compounds. however, phorate and disulfoton do
not contain any aromatic moieties and gave very low rocs combination scores. inspection of the docked structures for these two
compounds with plp suggests that the ethoxy group attached to the
central phosphorus atom may form hydrogen bonds with arg108
[93], which is well recognized as an important residue in the

cyp2c9 active site. this leaves the sulfur group between 7 and 8 å
from the iron heme. it appears that the thioether sulfur atom is an
energetically favorable site of metabolism by 2c9.
by using a crystal structure of cyp2c9 (1r9o) [80] and 20
known cyp2c9 inhibitors of  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation as a test set,
yasuo et al. (2009) [95] recently described a comfa model using
the best poses of the ligands. in 1r9o, there are four loop regions
not assigned in the x-ray structure, and thus residues 3842 and
214220 were built using the residues 2024 and 196202 of the
human  xxxg586xxx  x-ray structure (pdb code: 1pq2) which have a
homology with the corresponding regions of cyp2c9 [95]. two
pockets (site a and site b) were found in 1r9o using hbop and
hbsite. site a found to be located near the heme in the catalytic
site, and site b was located near phe69, pro367, and phe476. in
1og5 of cyp 2c9, a warfarin molecule was bound in site a. in
site b, substrate access channels around this site in various cyp
structures have been suggested through use of random expulsion
molecular dynamics by wade et al. [96]. this channel is observed
in an x-ray structure of mammalian cyp 2c5 (pdb code: 1dt6).
sixteen of the 20 inhibitors were judged to bind at site a near the
heme, and the four at site b according to the molecular mechanics

zhou et al.

fig. (17). illustration of the binding of different inhibitors of cyp2c9 to the active site of human cyp2c9 (pdb id: ir9o). the inhibitors include sulfaphenazole (a), phenylbutazone (b), benzbromarone (c), tanshinone iia (d), and silybin (e). these ligands can be readily docked into the active site of
cyp2c9, involving arg108, val113, ala297, leu362, and leu366.

with poisson-boltzmann surface area (mm-pbsa analysis) [95].
these results suggest that there should be at least two types of
inhibition: binding to site a, which is a competitive inhibition, and
binding to site b, which is an unknown type of cyp inhibition.
after a structure-based alignment was made up of the most energetically stable poses, a comfa model was constructed with that
alignment. in this model, the contributions of the electrostatic and
steric fields were 39.6 and 60.4%, respectively, which might explain the substrate preference of cyps for hydrophobic compounds.
the predicted ki values using this model have a good correlation to
the experimental data.
to investigate the molecular determinants for ligands of
cyp2c9, we have recently docked a series of substrates and inhibitors of cyp2c9 into the active site of ir9o using the autodock
program, without crystallographic water molecules (zhou et al.,
2009, unpublished data; please see (fig. (15), fig. (16), and fig.
(17)). multiple docking solutions of the cyp2c9 ligands were obtained, but only one or two docking solutions were accepted for the
substrates according to their productive orientations which could
lead to metabolite formation, and for the inhibitors according to
pharmacophore models. the polar and hydrophobic contacts between the substrates and the active site residues of cyp2c9 (e.g.

arg108, leu205, asp293, and asn474) are consistent with the
report from the crystal structure of cyp2c9 in complex with  xxxd2141xxx  (ir9o). for competitive inhibitors of cyp2c9, arg108,
val113, ala297, leu362, and leu366 are involved in the binding.
3.5. heteroactivation of cyp2c9
like cyp3a4 which is activated by  xxxd121xxx  (also a
substrate of this enzyme) [97], cyp2c9 is prone to both activation
and inhibition effects by several compounds. korzekwa et al.
(1998) [59] have reported that dapsone activated cyp2c9catalyzed metabolism of  xxxd2141xxx  and naproxen in human liver
microsomes and baculovirus-expressed cyp2c9 and proposed a
“two-site model” for the potential mechanism. the activation of
cyp2c9-mediated oxidation of  xxxd2141xxx , naproxen and  xxxd2969xxx  by dapsone and its analogs was further confirmed by several
studies [98-100]. in addition, amiodarone and benzbromarone activated naproxen o-demethylation, but inhibited diclofenac 4’hydroxylation in recombinant cyp2c9 [101]. the activation of
cyp2c9 by dapsone often results in a decrease of the k m and an
increase of the vmax of the reaction and thus increases the enzyme
efficiency and substrate turnover. this suggests that dapsone acti-

vates cyp2c9-mediated drug metabolism without displacing the
substrate from the active site, supporting a two-site model. notably,
dapsone is a substrate of cyp2c9 [102], but its own metabolism
was not affected by  xxxd2141xxx  [98].
hutzler et al. (2002) [99] investigated the structural features
that are needed to activate cyp2c9 using nine dapsone analogues
including three sulfone compounds, three carbonyl compounds
(benzophenone,  xxxd2423xxx , and dicyclohexylketone), and three
sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethazine)
(fig. (18)). the authors have revealed that phenylsulfone (i.e. dapsone without the para-amino groups) activated  xxxd2141xxx  4’hydroxylation comparable to dapsone but inhibited naproxen demethylation [99]. p-tolylsulfone at high concentrations (50 and
100 m) activated naproxen demethylation, but showed little effect
on  xxxd2141xxx  metabolism. sulfamethazine slightly activated
naproxen demethylation at high concentrations. the substratedependent effect on cyp2c9 suggests that naproxen has a different
binding orientation compared with  xxxd2141xxx . 4-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl)-aniline, which contains a nitro group in the place of one
amino group of dapsone, inhibited  xxxd2141xxx  4'-hydroxylation
with a ki of 320 m [99]. 4-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl)-aniline also
inhibited naproxen demethylation by 20%. other analogues including all three carbonyl analogs and three sulfonamides either had
minor or no effect on cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd2141xxx  and naproxen
metabolism. replacement of the sulfone group with a carbonyl
(benzophenone,  xxxd2423xxx , and dicyclohexylketone) has abolished
the activation properties, suggesting that the sulfone group contributes to recognition and binding to an effector site region that results
in activation of cyp2c9. a sulfone group in direct association with

two benzene rings with para electron donating groups is the most
efficient activator of cyp2c9, which activate the enzyme in a concentration- and substrate-dependent manner. however, the direction
of effect could not be predicted by correlation with simple chemical
properties such as pka or lipophilicity, suggesting the role of
specific activator-protein interactions.
hummel et al. (2004) [100] have found that dapsone increased
cyp2c9 activity in a genotype-dependent fashion. dapsone increased  xxxd2141xxx  4'-hydroxylation by cyp2c9.1, cyp2c9.2
(arg144cys), cyp2c9.3 (ile359leu), and cyp2c9.5 (asp360glu)
8-, 31-, 47-, and 22-fold, respectively. dapsone also increased
naproxen demethylation by cyp2c9.1, cyp2c9.2, cyp2c9.3, and
cyp2c9.5 7-, 15-, 13-, and 22-fold, respectively. dapsone changed
naproxen's kinetic profile from biphasic (cyp2c9.1 and
cyp2c9.2) or linear (cyp2c9.3 and cyp2c9.5) to hyperbolic for
all variants [100].
r- xxxd2444xxx  activated cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd3394xxx  4’hydroxylation and phenytoin hydroxylation in human liver microsomes (140 and 550% of control, with ec50 of 19.9 and 30.2 m,
respectively), but s- xxxd2444xxx  inhibited  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation with ic50 of 54 m and had no effect on phenytoin hydroxylation [103]. in recombinant cyp2c9 enzyme, r- xxxd2444xxx  also
activated phenytoin hydroxylation 8-fold, with an ec50 of 16.2 m,
but  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation was not affected.  xxxd2444xxx  is a
substrate of cyp2c9, 2c19 and 3a4 [104]. for phenytoin hydroxylation, r- xxxd2444xxx  increased the vmax but decreased its k m, suggesting that  xxxd2444xxx  does not displace phenytoin from the active site. however, r- xxxd2444xxx  did not activate the metabolism
of diclofenac and  xxxd990xxx  in both human liver microsomes and

3502 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

recombinant cyp2c9 [103]. indeed, r- xxxd2444xxx  inhibited swarfarin hydroxylation with an ic50 of 67.9 m, but had no effect
on diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation [103]. these findings demonstrate a
stereo-specific and substrate-dependent activation of cyp2c9 by
r- xxxd2444xxx , probably through binding to the active site and
inducing positive cooperativity.
the kinetic evidence does not establish whether the effector site
lies within or separate from the active site, although many models
have been proposed. the “two-site model” for cyp2c9 is supported by the resolved structure of cyp2c9 [30]. the warfarinbinding site could be one of these sites and its binding by another
compound might activate the enzyme through an allosteric mechanism, as there is sufficient space for other ligand molecules to bind
at the heme. however, there remains the possibility of enzyme conformational changes induced by effector binding. notably, the 7hydroxylation of  xxxd990xxx  itself by cyp2c9 follows typical
michaelis-menten kinetics [105], indicating that auto-activation
does not occur.
auto- and hetero-activation of cyps have important implications in drug-drug interactions and drug development. if this activation is observed in vivo, it might dramatically lower the efficacy of
a drug with a narrow therapeutic index such as phenytoin. however, it appears the in vivo activation of cyp2c9 is less apparent
compared to in vitro data. the oral clearance of  xxxd2141xxx  was
increased only by 11% after treatment with 100 mg dapsone for 7
days [106]. in addition, enzyme activation confounds the in vitro
determination of kinetic parameters and thus compromises the accurate prediction of drug interactions in vivo [107]. drug discovery
scientists should be aware of the potential for compounds structurally analogous to dapsone or  xxxd2444xxx  to activate cyp2c9 in
preclinical in vitro drug-drug interaction studies.
3.6. interaction of cyp2c9 with other cyps
all human cyp enzymes are heme-containing proteins consisting of a prosthetic group (i.e. iron  xxxd3037xxx ) and a single
polypeptide chain composed of about 500 amino acids. the central
iron atom of the heme group is bound non-covalently to the sulphur
atom of a cysteine residue situated close to the c-terminus of the
apoprotein chain. cyps metabolize a variety of structurally distinct
substrates by a two-electron transfer catalytic cycle, in which electrons are offered by either nadph-cytochrome p450 reductase
(cpr) or cytochrome b5 [3, 108, 109]. while cpr was found to be
essential for cyp-catalyzed reaction, change of  xxxg1456xxx  5
levels either showed no effect or significantly enhanced the catalytic efficiency of cyps [4, 110]. for efficient catalysis, the heme
iron of cyp has to be reduced by the passage of electrons from
nadph via cpr, forming a 1:1 functional complex of the cpr
with cyp [2]. however, cyp exist in a large excess over the cpr
molar concentrations in hepatic microsomes, ranging from 10:1 to
25:1, indicating that the amount of cpr may be a rate-limiting factor in the catalysis by cyps [111]. incorporation of extra cpr in
liver microsomes led to an increase of cyp-mediated metabolic
activity and maximal activity was observed at a cyp/cpr ratio of
1:1, which points to the formation of functionally active binary
complexes between cyps and cpr. additionally, cpr levels are
not readily increased by inducers of the cyps. treatment of prototypical cyp inducers such as phenobarbital or dexamethasone resulted in only a 2- to 3-fold increase in cpr concentrations,
whereas other cyp inducers, such as 3-methylcholanthrene, had
little or no effect on cpr concentrations [112, 113]. since the
amount of cpr is often limiting in tissue microsomes, individual
cyps must compete for the available cpr molecules.
both apo and holo-cytochrome b5 enhanced metabolism by
 xxxg582xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c19, 3a4 and 3a5 in reconstituted
systems [4]. cytochrome b5 enhanced cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd3394xxx  methylhydroxylation and  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation, but

zhou et al.

had no effect on  xxxg575xxx - or 2d6-catalyzed  xxxd380xxx  hydroxylation and cyp1a2-catalyzed theophylline 8-hydroxylation [114].
 xxxd1681xxx  6-hydroxylation by  xxxg589xxx  was stimulated by
cytochrome b5, but not by apo-b5 [114]. these findings suggest that
the effect of these protein-protein interactions of the redox partner
with cyps may involve enzyme conformational changes or other
mechanisms in addition to provision of electrons.
human or animal individual cyps may interact with each
other, leading to altered substrate metabolism rates. cawley et al.
(1995) [115] revealed that the rabbit cyp1a2-catalyzed 7pentoxyresorufin o-dealkylation was substantially inhibited when
rabbit cyp2b4 was present, while rabbit cyp1a2 slightly enhanced cyp2b4-mediated  xxxd311xxx  demethylation in simple
reconstituted systems. inhibition of 7-pentoxyresorufin odealkylation by rabbit cyp2b4 was dependent on cpr levels, with
the inhibitory effect being more apparent at subsaturating cpr
[115]. these results suggest that the cyp1a2-2b4 interaction may
involve competition for cpr molecules. yamazaki et al. (1997)
[114] reported that human cyp3a4-catalyzed testosterone 6hydroxylation was stimulated by cyp1a2 and also by a modified
form in which the first 36 residues of the native human protein were
removed but such stimulation was not observed when  xxxg587xxx ,
2d6, or  xxxd851xxx  were added to the reconstituted systems. however,
cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd3394xxx  methylhydroxylation and cyp2e1catalyzed  xxxd1681xxx  6-hydroxylation were not enhanced or
inhibited by addition of other cyps.
in microsomes containing human  xxxg582xxx  and  xxxd851xxx  and cpr
obtained from a baculovirus triple-protein expression system, the
two cyp enzymes were shown to compete with each other for interaction with cpr [116]. in incubations with the triple enzymes,
the presence of a  xxxg582xxx  substrate, coumarin, decreased nnitrosodimethylamine demethylation by up to 47%, and the presence of a  xxxg589xxx  substrate, n-nitrosodimethylamine, decreased
 xxxg582xxx -catalyzed coumarin hydroxylation by up to 19% [116].
this substrate-induced competition between  xxxg582xxx  and  xxxd851xxx  was
decreased by the addition of purified cytochrome b5.
backes et al. (1998) [117] reconstituted a triple-protein system
with cpr, rabbit cyp1a2, and 2b4, and examined the effect of
cpr concentration on 7-pentoxyresorufin-o-dealkylation with
cyp2b4-cpr and cyp1a2-cpr binary systems, and in ternary
systems containing different cyp2b4:1a2 ratios. at subsaturating
cpr levels, there was a dramatic inhibition of the cyp2b4dependent activity in the ternary system as compared with the binary systems. these results are consistent with the formation of a
ternary cpr-cyp1a2-cyp2b4 complex where the cpr is bound
specifically to cyp1a2. at higher cpr concentrations where the
cpr-binding sites on cyp1a2 become saturated, the results are
consistent with the formation of a quaternary complex in which
cpr binds to both cyp enzymes, resulting in cpr-cyp1a2cyp2b4-cpr complexes. analogous experiments using the
cyp1a2-preferred substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin showed a stimulation of 7-ethoxyresorufin o-deethylation in the mixed reconstituted
system, demonstrating that the high-affinity cyp2b4-cyp1a2cpr complex was functionally active and not merely serve as an
inhibitory complex.
li et al. (1999) [118] coexpressed human cyp2d6 and 3a4 together with cpr in e. coli and investigated the possible competition of the two cyps for cpr. the authors found that testosterone
inhibited the cyp2d6-mediated  xxxd380xxx  1’-hydroxylation in bacterial membranes containing both cyp2d6 and 3a4 but not in
membranes containing cyp2d6 and cpr only. the magnitude of
metabolic inhibition was moderately influenced by the cpr level,
with a 57% and 36% inhibition in the presence of high and low
cpr levels, respectively. similarly,  xxxd380xxx  inhibited the
cyp3a4-mediated testosterone 6-hydroxylation in bacterial
membranes containing both cyp3a4 and 2d6 but not in mem-

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

branes containing only cyp3a4 with cpr [118]. the inhibition of
the testosterone hydroxylation by  xxxd380xxx  was less pronounced
than the inhibition of the  xxxd380xxx  hydroxlation by testosterone.
the cpr level also had a moderate effect on the inhibition of testosterone hydroxylation by  xxxd380xxx . in each case, inhibition was
observed even at a cyp to cpr ratio of 1.9:1, which is more favorable than the ratio of 4 reported for human livers [118]. however,
testosterone had no significant effect on  xxxd380xxx  1’-hydroxylation,
coumarin 7-hydroxylation, and 7-ethoxyresorufin o-deethylation of
recombinant cyp2d6,  xxxd577xxx , and 1a2, respectively, but testosterone
inhibited these activities by 38%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, in
human liver microsomes [118]. the authors suggested that both
cyp2d6 and 3a4 competed for cpr molecules.
hazai and kupfer (2005) [119] found that human cyp2c19catalyzed  xxxd2143xxx  o-demethylation and s- xxxd2568xxx  hydroxylation were significantly inhibited by the addition of cyp2c9,
but cyp2c9-catalyzed diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation was enhanced
by the presence of cyp2c19 and this activation increased with the
addition of increasing amount of cyp2c19 enzyme. the degree of
cyp2c9-mediated inhibition was dependent on both the substrate
used and the amount of cpr added to the reconstituted system and
the extent of inhibition was smaller with s- xxxd2568xxx  than with
 xxxd2143xxx . a biphasic response was observed, with a steep decrease in  xxxd2143xxx  o-demethylase activity caused by the addition of small amounts of cyp2c9. a 50% inhibition occurred by
adding 12 pmol (12 nm) of cyp2c9, and 30% inhibition occurred
by adding 40 pmol (40 nm) of cyp2c9 at a cyp2c19:cpr ratio of
2:1 and cyp2c19:cpr ratio of 1:2, respectively, compared with
the activity in the absence of cyp2c9 [119]. using a similar approach as in the studies of cawley et al. (1995) [115] and backes et
al. (1998) [117], two possible mechanisms have been proposed for
cyp2c9-2c19 interactions by hazai and kupfer (2005) [119]: a)
there is a simple competition between cyp2c9 and 2c19 for the
cpr, and cyp2c9 exhibits a much higher affinity toward cpr
than cyp2c19 and is therefore capable of preferentially sequestering the cpr; or b) cyp2c19 and 2c9 form a binary complex in the
presence of the substrate, with altered affinity toward cpr rather
than in the cyp2c19-cpr or cyp2c9-cpr complexes. however,
there is a possibility of forming cyp2c9-cyp2c19 complexes,
with the cyp2c9 moiety of this complex possessing a higher activity toward the cpr than the cyp2c9-cpr complex.
subramanian et al. (2009) [120] have recently investigated the
interaction of human cyp2c9 and 2d6 using a purified reconstituted enzyme system. pre-incubation of cyp2d6 with cyp2c9
inhibited cyp2c9-mediated s- xxxd2141xxx  4’-hydroxylation in a
protein concentration dependent manner. when 2.5 or 5 pmol of
cyp2d6 was preincubated with cyp2c9, a significant inhibition
of s- xxxd2141xxx  4’-hydroxylation was observed [120]. cyp2d6
decreased the vmax value by up to 50% when both enzymes were
co-incubated at a ratio of 1:1, but no apparent effects on the k m
values. when cyp2c9 was combined with cyp2d6 followed by
the addition of cpr, the vmax was decreased and increased levels of
cpr did not restore the cyp2c9 activity. a similar trend was observed when cyp2c9 and cpr were initially combined followed
by addition of cyp2d6. however, when cyp2d6 and cpr were
initially combined, followed by the addition of cyp2c9, addition
of more cytochrome p450 reductase restored partial activity. spectral binding studies revealed a 20-fold increase in the ks of
cyp2c9 towards s- xxxd2141xxx  in the presence of cyp2d6 compared to the control incubation (6 vs 118 m) [120]. this clearly
demonstrates a mixing order-dependent effect on the cyp2c9 inhibition by cyp2d6 which may be explained by a simple kinetic
scheme, providing indirect evidence for the formation of cyp2c9cyp2d6 heteromers. in contrast, addition of equimolar cyp2c9
showed no effect on cyp2d6-mediated dextromethorphan odemethylation [120].

the mechanisms for the reported cyp-cyp interactions are
unknown, but conformational changes, altered catalytic cycle functioning, formation of cyp oligomers, ionic interactions, or other
mechanisms have been suggested. for example,  xxxg575xxx  and 3a2
but not 1a2 or  xxxd851xxx  form complexes in microsomal membranes
[121]. the cyp-cyp interactions may have a confounding effect
on the extrapolation of in vitro-in vivo correlations since human
liver microsomes are still one of the most commonly used in vitro
systems for drug metabolism studies. in human hepatic microsomes, a number of cyps coexist, and their mutual interaction
could influence their respective individual activity.
4. substrate specificity of cyp2c9
4.1. probe substrates of cyp2c9
s- xxxd2141xxx  (4’-hydroxylation) [122],  xxxd990xxx  (7hydroxylation) [122],  xxxd3394xxx  (methylhydroxylation), phenytoin (4’-hydroxylation) [123], losartan (oxidation) [124], and diclofenac (4’-hydroxylation) [122] have been commonly used as
probe substrates for cyp2c9 (fig. (19)) [125]. diclofenac 4’hydroxylation and  xxxd3394xxx  methylhydroxylation have been well
studied as marker reactions of cyp2c9 activity and are most commonly used in cyp2c9 phenotyping studies, although some activity of other cyp2c enzymes for these substrates has been observed
[126].  xxxd2141xxx  can be included into the 5-drug “pittsburgh”
cocktail, which does not cause metabolic interactions with other
probes [127]. an ideal phenotyping probe should pose a minimal
risk to the subjects if it is intended to be used in large populations.
since the enzyme activity in subjects with cyp2c9*3/*3 genotype
is almost absent, it might be hazardous to use oral anti-diabetics,
phenytoin or oral anticoagulants as probe drugs.
the most widely used fluorogenic substrate for phenotyping
cyp2c9 activity in vitro is mfc [128]. mfc-based fluorometric
cyp2c9 assays are rapid with a high-throughput screening capacity, easy to perform, and amenable to automation. in addition, vivid
green (benzyloxymethyl fluorescein) as a flurogenic substrate for
cyp2c9 (resulting in fluorescein) has an increasing use in the
high-throughput screening of potential cyp2c9 inhibitors.
4.2. therapeutic drugs
a number of clinical drugs are metabolized by cyp2c9 to certain extent [15, 29]. the contribution of cyp2c9 to the metabolic
clearance of these drugs varies and thus the impact of cyp2c9
polymorphisms and enzyme inhibition on their clearance is different.
4.2.1. analgesics
4.2.1.1. aminopyrine
aminopyrine, a drug for the control of postoperative pain, was
one of the first drugs to be associated with high incidence of
agranulocytosis [129, 130] and thus was withdrawn from the market. aminopyrine breath test has been widely used to assess liver
metabolic function [131-134]. komori et al. (1988) [135] reported
that aminopyrine n-demethylation by p450- xxxg448xxx  (cyp2c9/2c19)
was about 4-fold higher than that by p450- xxxg447xxx  (cyp3a4) (fig.
(20)). garcia-agundes et al. (1990) [136] observed a significant
inter-individual difference in aminopyrine n-demethylase activity
in human liver microsomes from patients. aminopyrine ndemethylase activity was significantly correlated with caffeine demethylase activity in 21 healthy subjects [137], suggesting the involvement of cyp1a2 in aminopyrine n-demethylation. in vitro
studies indicate that the n-demethylation of aminopyrine was catalysed most efficiently by cyp2c19, followed by  xxxg586xxx , 2d6,
2c18 and 1a2, whereas the activity with  xxxg589xxx  was negligible
[138]. interestingly, human steroidogenic  xxxg573xxx  (i.e.  xxxg573xxx )
also catalysed aminopyrine n-demethylation and the activity was

breath test is widely used to assess liver metabolic function. the ndemethylation of aminopyrine was catalysed most efficiently by cyp2c19,
followed by  xxxg586xxx , 2d6, 2c18, 1a2 and 17a1, whereas the activity with
 xxxg589xxx  was negligible.

evaluating non-selective liver drug-oxidizing capacity [144, 145].
the  xxxd192xxx  clearance test is most commonly used and correlates
well with the degree of liver damage [146].  xxxd192xxx  was extensively (60-80%) metabolized and was mainly converted to  xxxd1964xxx , 4-hydroxyantipyrine, and 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine (fig.
(21)) [147].  xxxd192xxx  metabolites were formed by cyp1a2, 2b6,
2c8, 2c9, 2c18, and 3a4 [148]. 4-hydroxylation was mainly catalyzed by cyp3a4 and, to a lesser extent, by cyp1a2. the cyp2c
subfamily contains the predominant enzymes for  xxxd1964xxx 
formation, and cyp1a2 also contributed to this reaction. formation of 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine was mediated by cyp1a2 and
2c9 [148].
4.2.2.  xxxg99xxx  receptor inhibitors
 xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers (so-called ‘sartans’) bind specifically to the  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor (at1 ) and are used to
treat hypertension where patients are intolerant of  xxxg99xxx 
converting enzyme inhibitors [149-151]. candesartan, eprosartan,
irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan,  xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  are marketed and used clinically (fig. (22)) [152-157]. candesartan, losartan, irbesartan, and  xxxd3487xxx  have a common tetrazolo-biphenyl
structure, while all active  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers except
irbesartan have a carboxylic acid group. with the exception of eprosartan, candesartan, irbesartan,  xxxd3165xxx ,  xxxd3295xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx  and zolasartan are developed based on losartan's prototypical chemical structure. the mode of  xxxg100xxx  antagonism
has been characterized as surmountable/noncompetitive by losartan,
 xxxd3295xxx , and eprosartan or insurmountable/noncompetitive by
candesartan,  xxxd3165xxx , zolasartan, irbesartan,  xxxd3487xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx , and e-3174.  xxxd417xxx  is a prodrug, while losartan
has a metabolite (e-3174) which is much more active than the parent drug [158]. no other metabolites of sartans contribute significantly to the antihypertensive effect. the diverse chemical structure
of sartans results in marked differences in the binding affinity to
at1 and pharmacokinetic profiles [159]. most sartsans are metabolized by cyp2c9, but the contribution varies [159].

3-oh-methylantipyrine

(21). metabolism of  xxxd192xxx  by cyp2c9 and other cyps.  xxxd192xxx  has been widely used as a probe drug for human oxidative drug
metabolism. it was mainly converted to  xxxd1964xxx , 4-hydroxyantipyrine,
and 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine.  xxxd192xxx  metabolites were formed by
cyp1a2, 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c18, and 3a4. 4-hydroxylation was mainly
catalyzed by cyp3a4 and, to a lesser extent, by cyp1a2. the cyp2c
subfamily contains the predominant enzymes for  xxxd1964xxx  formation,
and cyp1a2 also contributed to this reaction. in addition, formation of 3hydroxymethylantipyrine was mediated by cyp1a2 and 2c9.

4.2.2.1. candesartan
candesartan selectively blocks the binding of  xxxg99xxx  to
the  xxxg100xxx  in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle
and the adrenal gland [160]. it is used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure [161-163]. candesartan is liberated from its ester racemic prodrug,  xxxd417xxx , by presystemic hydrolysis in the intestinal wall [164]. following administration of  xxxd417xxx , the absolute bioavailability of pharmacologically active candesartan was estimated to be 15%. the elimination half-life of candesartan is 9 hr. candesartan is mainly excreted as unchanged drug (75%) in urine and feces [165]. when
candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. it undergoes minor hepatic metabolism
(<20%) by o-deethylation to an inactive metabolite (cv-15959) via
cyp2c9 (fig. (23)) [166, 167]. like losartan and zolarsartan, candesartan also undergoes n-glucuronidation in the tetrazole ring by
 xxxd3476xxx  glucuronosyltransferase 1a3 ( xxxg2383xxx ,
ec2.4.1.17) [168]. o-glucuronide is also formed from candesartan.
cyp2c9*3 may change not only the metabolic activity toward candesartan but also the inhibitory susceptibility compared with
cyp2c9*1.
4.2.2.2. irbesartan
irbesartan is a potent long-acting  xxxg99xxx  receptor at1
antagonist [169, 170]. irbesartan undergoes n-glucuronidation on
the tetrazole moiety in human liver microsomes [171]. the drug
was metabolized mainly by glucuronidation primarily on the tetrazole ring, hydroxylation, and additional oxidation in mice, rats,
rabbits, and macaques [172]. the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan
has been investigated in healthy subjects [173, 174] and in patients
with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or heart failure [175].
the primary metabolic pathway of irbesartan in humans is oxidative leading to mono- and di-hydroxylated metabolites or metabolites resulting from further oxidation of these hydroxylated metabo-

(24). metabolism of irbesartan by cyp2c9. hydroxylation of irbesartan occurs primarily at the -1 carbon of the butyl side chain or on the spirocyclopentyl ring. hydroxylation of the spirocyclopentyl ring occurs on the carbon atom  to the spiro carbon atom. as two stereo-chemical orientations are likely
at each of these two carbon atoms, there are four possible isomers. following oral administration of irbesartan, eight metabolites have been identified in human
urine: a tetrazole n2--glucuronide conjugate (m8), a monohydroxylated metabolite resulting from -1 oxidation of the butyl side chain (m4), two different
monohydroxylated metabolites resulting from oxidation of the spirocyclopentane ring (m5 & m7), a diol resulting from -1 oxidation of the butyl side chain
and oxidation of the spirocyclopentane ring (m1), a keto metabolite resulting from further oxidation of the -1 monohydroxy metabolite (m6), a keto-alcohol
resulting from further oxidation of the -1 hydroxyl of the diol (m2), and a carboxylic acid metabolite resulting from oxidation of the terminal methyl group of
the butyl side chain (m3). the predominant metabolite in urine was the -1 hydroxylated derivative, accounting for about 25% of the urinary radioactivity. in
feces, irbesartan was the predominant drug-related component (about 30% of the radioactivity), and the primary metabolites were monohydroxylated metabolites and the carboxylic acid metabolite. irbesartan is metabolized by human cyp2c9. the dihydroimidazole ring can be opened to result in sr 49498.

the butyl side chain and oxidation of the spirocyclopentane ring
(m1), a keto metabolite resulting from further oxidation of the -1
mono-hydroxy metabolite (m6), a keto-alcohol resulting from further oxidation of the -1 hydroxyl of the diol (m2), and a carboxylic acid metabolite resulting from oxidation of the terminal methyl
group of the butyl side chain (m3). in addition, n-dealkylation of
irbesartan is a minor metabolic pathway in humans. in urine, irbesartan and its glucuronide accounted for about 10 to 20% of the
urinary radioactivity. the predominant metabolite in urine was the
-1 hydroxylated derivative, which constituted about 25% of the
urinary radioactivity. in feces, irbesartan was the predominant drugrelated component (30% of the radioactivity), and the primary
metabolites were mono-hydroxylated metabolites and the carboxylic acid metabolite. irbesartan is metabolized by human cyp2c9
in vitro [176]. fluconazole increased the steady-state peak plasma
concentration of irbesartan by 19% and auc by 63% [177], but
these increases are not likely to be clinically significant. m3, the
major circulating metabolite in plasma (about 9% of the plasma
radioactivity at 6 hr), was found to be more than 1,000-fold less
potent than irbesartan as an inhibitor of the  xxxg100xxx . a steady-

state study in 711 chinese patients with hypertension treated with
irbesartan 150 mg daily for 28 days found that the cyp2c9*3 allele
carriers (n = 54) had significantly higher plasma irbesartan concentrations at 6 and 24 hr after dosing, but no significant association
was found between the cyp2c9*3 allelic variant and the therapeutic effect of irbesartan on essential hypertension as measured by
reduction in systolic blood pressure [178].
4.2.2.3. losartan
losartan is the first selective  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist
developed for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart
failure [179]. losartan is primarily metabolized by cyp2c9 via an
aldehyde intermediate (e-3179) to the 5-carboxylic acid metabolite
e-3174, with considerable contribution from cyp3a4 (fig. (25))
[180-182]. cyp2c9 and 3a4 can oxidize both losartan and the
aldehyde e-3179 to the carboxylic acid e-3174 which is the predominant active species with 10- to 40-fold higher potency than the
parent molecule at the  xxxg100xxx  with a longer half-life [183].
although only 14% of losartan is converted to e-3174, the auc of
the latter is 4- to 8-fold higher than that of the parent drug and is
considered to be the primary contributor to the pharmacologic activity [183]. fluconazole (an inhibitor of both cyp2c9 and 3a4)
decreased the metabolism of losartan to e-3174 [184, 185]. however, itraconazole, a cyp3a4-selective inhibitor, had no significant

rats and humans. this cleavage was postulated to occur via oxidation of the benzylic carbon atom of losartan, followed by decomposition of the resulting hemiaminal metabolite. moreover, a tetrazole-n2--glucuronide conjugate has been identified as a metabolite of losartan.

volunteers have ruled out the importance of the polymorphic
cyp2d6 and 2c19 in the metabolic elimination of losartan [186].
in addition, n-dealkylation of losartan was observed in incubations
with liver slices from rats and humans [187]. this cleavage was
speculated to occur via oxidation of the benzylic carbon atom of
losartan, followed by decomposition of the resulting hemiaminal
metabolite. moreover, a tetrazole-n2--glucuronide conjugate has
been identified as a metabolite of losartan [187]. ugt1a1, 1a3,

total dose to e-3174 [188]. individuals homozygous and heterozygous for the cyp2c9*3 allele showed much lower auc of e-3174
(7-50%) compared to the wild-type.

4.2.2.4.  xxxd3487xxx 
 xxxd3487xxx  is a potent and selective  xxxg99xxx   xxxg100xxx 
blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart
failure [189-191]. the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (auc) and maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of  xxxd3487xxx  increase approximately linearly with increasing dose over the
clinical dosing range [189].  xxxd3487xxx  does not accumulate appreciably in plasma following repeated administration. the absolute
bioavailability of  xxxd3487xxx  is about 25%. when administered as an
oral solution,  xxxd3487xxx  is primarily recovered in feces (83% of the
dose) and urine (13% of the dose) [192].  xxxd3487xxx  is known to be
excreted largely as unchanged drug (80%) and is minimally metabolized in human [192]. the primary circulating metabolite, accounting for about 9% of dose, is valeryl 4-hydroxy  xxxd3487xxx  (fig.

amiodarone is a class iii antiarrhythmic agent used for the
treatment of life-threatening supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or haemodynamically
unstable ventricular tachycardia [203]. amiodarone is the most
commonly used antiarrhythmic agent which can control a wide
spectrum of atrial and ventricular antiarrhythmic disorders [204]. it
is mainly metabolized to an active metabolite, desethylamiodarone
by cyp3a4 and 2c8 in humans (fig. (27)) [205, 206]. in vitro
studies have revealed that  xxxg586xxx  and 3a4 are the major enzymes
contributing to amiodarone n-deethylation in human livers at clinically significant concentrations and that cyp1a2, 2c9, and 2d6
play a minor role [207].

dapsone is a sulphone antibacterial agent used mainly in the
treatment of all forms of leprosy [208-210]. its clinical use of dapsone is hindered by its dose-dependent adverse hematological reactions, in particular methemoglobinemia [211-214]. in addition,
patients with a genetic deficiency of certain enzymes involved in
the process of toxicity are more susceptible to the hematological
effects even at therapeutic dosage [212, 215, 216]. dapsone is detoxified by arylamine n-acetyltransferase ( xxxg1506xxx , ec2.3.1.5) while
its n-hydroxylation to the reactive hydroxylamine is mainly catalyzed by cyp2c9,  xxxd851xxx  and 3a4, flavin-containing monooxygenase
(fmo, ec1.14.13.8) and cyclooxygenase (cox, ec1.14.99.1),

4.2.5.1. bortezomib
bortezomib ( xxxd357xxx , [(1r)-3-methyl-1-[[(2s)-1-oxo-3-phenyl2-[(pyrazinylcarbonyl) amino]propyl]amino]butyl]boronic acid), an
n-pyrazinylcarbonylated derivative of the dipeptide boronic acid
phe-leu-boh2, is a potent, first-in-class, reversible 26s proteasome
inhibitor with ki of about 0.62 nm [229]. this drug not only targets
the myeloma cell, but also acts in the bone marrow microenvironment, inhibiting the binding of myeloma cells to bone marrow
stromal cells [230, 231]. as a dipeptidyl boronic acid, bortezomib
had been approved by the united states food and drug administration (fda) on 13 may 2003 for the treatment of relapsed refractory
multiple myeloma [232]. inhibition of the 26s proteasome involves
the formation of a reversible dative bond between the n-terminal

thr residue of the chymotryptic-like site and the boron atom of
bortezomib [233]. bortezomib binds to the 20s proteasome located
in center of 26s proteasome via the boronic acid moiety, and the
presence of this moiety is thus necessary to achieve proteasome
inhibition. the 20s proteasome comprises two -subunits and two
proteolytic -subunits, each possessing chymotryptic, tryptic, and
postglutamyl endopeptidase activities [234, 235]. the proteasome
hydrolyzes proteins through the ubiquitin pathway and therefore
plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis and regulation of cell
cycle, transcription, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and antigen presentation [235, 236]. various hematological cancers are highly dependent on amplified proteasome activity for cell survival through
increased nuclear transcription and activation of anti-apoptotic proteins and thus the inhibition of 20s proteasome results in apoptosis
and death of cancer cells [237, 238]
pekol et al. (2005) [239] have identified several circulating metabolites of bortezomib in the plasma of eight patients receiving a
single intravenous dose of bortezomib at 1.6-2.0 mg/m2 in a phase i
study [239]. the principal metabolic route of bortezomib observed
in patients was oxidative deboronation, giving rise to a pair of diastereomeric carbinolamide metabolites, m1 and m2 (fig. (30)).
further metabolism of the leu and phe moieties yielded tertiary
hydroxylated metabolites and a metabolite hydroxylated at the benzylic position (m5 and m6, and m8), respectively [239]. hydroxylation at the c-2 and c-3 positions of m1 and m2 resulted in m5
and m6, respectively. oxidation of m8 was the only hydroxylation
reaction of the phe moiety from m2, while hydroxylation at the leu
residue yielded m25-m28 which were detected in patient plasma at
low levels [239]. conversion via hydrolysis of the carbinolamides

fig. (30). metabolism of bortezomib. the principal metabolic route of bortezomib observed in patients was oxidative deboronation, giving rise to a pair of
diastereomeric carbinolamide metabolites, m1 and m2. further metabolism of the leu and phe moieties yielded tertiary hydroxylated metabolites and a metabolite hydroxylated at the benzylic position (m5 and m6, and m8), respectively. hydroxylation at the c-2 and c-3 positions of m1 and m2 resulted in m5
and m6, respectively. oxidation of m8 was the only hydroxylation reaction of the phe moiety from m2, while hydroxylation at the leu residue yielded m25m28 which were detected in patient plasma at low levels. conversion via hydrolysis of the carbinolamides m1 and m2 to the corresponding amide (m3) and
carboxylic acid (m4) was also observed. subsequent degradation of m8 resulted in its respective amide m33. m23 and m24 were proposed to be structural
isomers generating from a net deboronation and dehydrogenation. m25, m26 and m27, and m28 observed in patient plasma were proposed to be two pairs of
diastereomers derived from m1 and m2, respectively. recombinant cyp3a4, 2c19, 1a2, 2d6, and 2c9 catalysed the formation of m1 and m2 from bortezomib. in addition, cyp1a2, 2c9, 2d6, and 3a4 catalyzed the formation of m23 and m24, and the hydroxylation of c-7 at the phe moiety of m2 was mediated by cyp3a4, giving rise to m8. please note that the chemical structures for m23 and m24 are unidentified, therefore both are depicted by an unsaturation
of the c1 to c3 alkyl system.

(m4) was also observed. subsequent degradation of m8 resulted in
its respective amide m33. m23 and m24 were proposed to be structural isomers generating from a net deboronation and dehydrogenation. m25, m26 and m27, and m28 observed in patient plasma
were proposed to be two pairs of diastereomers derived from m1
and m2, respectively [239]. phe moiety oxidation of bortezomib by
cyp3a4 is consistent with the metabolism of peptide protease inhibitors bearing phe substituents such as the hiv-1 protease inhibitor indinavir [240].
human liver microsomes largely mimicked the in vivo metabolism of bortezomib, since all the major circulating metabolites in
patient plasma (e.g. m1-m6, m8, and m23-m28) were also de-

tected in human liver microsomes [239]. deboronation of bortezomib to carbinolamides m1 and m2 remained the principal metabolic pathway in human liver microsomes. m5 and m6 represented
the principal hydroxylated carbinolamides, while metabolites m25
to m28 were detected at lower levels in human liver microsomes
[239]. subsequent degradation of m8 to its respective amide m33
was observed in human liver microsomes and is consistent with
carbinolamide degradation, e.g., m1 and m2 degradation to m3.
the metabolite m34 was observed in liver microsomes, resulting
from the oxidative deboronation of bortezomib. recombinant
cyp3a4, 2c19, 1a2, 2d6, and 2c9 catalysed the formation of m1
and m2 from bortezomib [239]. in addition, cyp1a2, 2c9, 2d6,
and 3a4 catalyzed the formation of m23 and m24, and the hy-

fig. (31). metabolism of cyclophosphamide. 4-oh-cyclophosphamide is a major circulating metabolite that enters tumor cells and decompose through its
tautomer aldophosphamide (an aldehyde intermediate) by spontaneous -elimination to form ultimate cytotoxic phosphoramide mustard [n,n-bis-2-(2chloroethyl)phosphorodiamidic acid] and an equimolar amount of the urotoxic byproduct acrolein which is a highly electrophilic ,-unsaturated aldehyde.
alternatively, the tautomer of 4-oh-cyclophosphamide aldophosphamide can be oxidized by  xxxg110xxx  and aldo-keto reductase to generate aldophosphamide. the resultant phosphamide mustard is a bifunctional alkylator of dna and the ultimate cytotoxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide. the alkylation involves generation of the intermediate phosphoramide aziridinium ion through an intramolecular nucleophilic attack (i.e. a cyclization reaction) of the
nitrogen on the -carbon of a chloroethyl chain. alternatively, 4-oh-cyclophosphamide is detoxified to nontoxic and unstable ocarboxyethylcyclophosphoramide mustard (i.e. carboxyphosphamide) by cytosolic aldhs. in addition, cyclophosphamide also undergoes significant side
chain oxidation (i.e. n-dechloroethylation) in vitro primarily by cyp3a4, 3a7 and 3a5 and, to a minor extent, by  xxxg583xxx  to generate inactive dechloroethyl
metabolites and the toxic byproduct chloroacetaldehyde.

droxylation of c-7 at the phe moiety of m2 was mediated by
cyp3a4, giving rise to m8 [239].
further studies using the relative activity factor, inhibitory antibodies for cyps and selective chemical inhibitors by uttamsingh et
al. (2005) [241] indicate that cyp3a4 and 2c19 were the major
contributors to the metabolism of bortezomib, with lesser contribution from cyp1a2, 2c9 and 2d6. the rate of bortezomib metabolism with the cdna-expressed cyps followed the order of
cyp2c19 > 3a4 > 2d6 > 1a2 > 2c9. after normalizing with relative activity factor, the percentage contribution of each cyp to the
rate of bortezomib metabolism in human liver microsomes was in
the order of cyp3a4 (38.4%) > 2c19 (30.1%) > 1a2 (10.5%) >
2d6 (7.1%) > 2c9 (1.2%). based on the data from chemical inhibition studies, the percentage contribution of each cyp to bortezomib
metabolism in human liver microsomes followed the order:
cyp3a4 (69.8%) > 2c19 (33.5%) > 2d6 (23.4%) > 1a2 (15.8%) >
2c9 (13.6%) [241]. furthermore, the percentage contribution of
each cyp to the metabolism of bortezomib in human liver microsomes based on inhibition studies with the monoclonal antibodies
followed the order: cyp3a4 (79%) > 2c19 (23%) > 1a2 (18%) >
2d6 (6.6%) > 2c9 (5.4%).
bortezomib, m1, and m2 were moderate inhibitors of
cyp2c19 with ic50 values of 18.0, 10.0, and 13.2 m, respectively
[242]. m1 was also a moderate inhibitor of cyp2c9 with ic50 of
11.5 m. however, bortezomib, m1, m2, m3, and m4 had no inhibitory effects on cyp3a4, 2d6 and 1a2.

overall, the primary route of metabolism of bortezomib in humans is deboronation, followed by desaturation of the leu moiety.
due to the significant contribution of both cyp3a4 and 2c19 to
the metabolic clearance of bortezomib, there is a potential for drug
interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these two enzymes.
however, a recent clinical study did not observe any effect of omeprazole (a cyp2c19 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics, therapeutic response and safety profiles of bortezomib in cancer patients
with advanced solid tumours, non-hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple
myeloma [243]. the polymorphisms of cyp2c19 and cyp3a4
may have an impact on the clearance of bortezomib. since cyp2c9
only plays a minor role in the disposition of bortezomib, the potential for drug interactions due to induction and/or inhibition of this
enzyme is minimal. the genotype status of cyp2c9 would not
affect the clearance of bortezomib in cancer patients.
4.2.5.2. cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide
both cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are metabolized by
 xxxg583xxx  and other cyps (fig. (31) & fig. (32)) [244-246]. both
cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are administered as prodrugs that
require activation by hepatic  xxxg583xxx - and 2c9- and 3a4-catalysed
4-hydroxylation, giving rise to ultimate cytotoxic nitrogen mustards
(phosphoramide mustard or isophosphoramide mustard) capable of
reacting with dna strands to form crosslinks and finally induce
tumor cell apoptosis [247-250]. the liver is the critical organ for
cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide metabolism, but the various

mustard is a bifunctional alkylator of dna and the ultimate cytotoxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide. the alkylation involves
generation of the intermediate phosphoramide aziridinium ion
through an intramolecular nucleophilic attack (i.e. a cyclization
reaction) of the nitrogen on the -carbon of a chloroethyl chain
[254]. alternatively, 4-oh-cyclophosphamide is detoxified to nontoxic and unstable o-carboxyethylcyclophosphoramide mustard
(i.e. carboxyphosphamide) by cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases
(aldhs, ec1.1.1.2). in addition, cyclophosphamide also undergoes significant side chain oxidation (i.e. n-dechloroethylation) in
vitro primarily by cyp3a4, 3a7 and 3a5 and, to a minor extent,
by  xxxg583xxx  to generate inactive dechloroethyl metabolites and the
toxic by-product chloroacetaldehyde [244].

cyps in extrahepatic organs such as lungs, intestines and kidneys
may play a role. 4-oh-cyclophosphamide is a major circulating
metabolite that enters tumor cells and decompose through its
tautomer aldophosphamide (an aldehyde intermediate) by spontaneous -elimination to form ultimate cytotoxic phosphoramide
mustard [n,n-bis-2-(2-chloroethyl)phosphorodiamidic acid] and an
equimolar amount of the urotoxic by-product acrolein which is a
highly electrophilic ,-unsaturated aldehyde [251-253]. alternatively, the tautomer of 4-oh-cyclophosphamide aldophosphamide
can be oxidized by  xxxg110xxx  (adh, ec1.1.1.1) and
aldo-keto reductase [akr, including aldehyde reductase (ec
1.1.1.2), aldose reductase (ec 1.1.1.21), and keto reductase (ec
1.1.1.18)] to generate alcophosphamide. the resultant phosphamide

to carboxyifosfamide by  xxxg127xxx  and alcoifosfamide by akr. alternatively, aldoifosfamide can decompose to generate cytotoxic ifosforamide mustard
with concurrent formation of acrolein by spontaneous -elimination. notably, cyclophosphamide is almost completely converted to its  xxxd2299xxx -hydroxymetabolite in humans, whereas 25-60% of ifosfamide is metabolized to chloroacetaldehyde through 2- and 3-dechloroethylation.

fig. (33). metabolism of imatinib. the metabolism of imatinib is complicated. its phase i metabolism pathways included n-demethylation (e.g., main metabolite cgp74588), piperazine ring oxidation with lactam formation (apg049, apg050, m29.6, and m28.8), piperazine-n-4 oxidation (cgp71422), pyridine noxidation (cgp72383), and benzylic hydroxylation (afn911). furthermore, the loss of the piperazine moiety by oxidative deamination and rapid further oxidation of the intermediate aldehyde to a carboxylic acid led to the formation of the metabolite m42.2. phase ii metabolic routes included direct conjugation of
imatinib and the n-desmethyl metabolite (cgp74588), resulting in m21.0 and m20.0a, respectively, most probably at nitrogen, and glucuronidation of oxidative metabolites. following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the t1/2 of imatinib and its major active metabolite, the n-demethyl derivative
(cgp74588), are approximately 18 and 40 hr, respectively. in vitro, imatinib was metabolized to the active cgp74588 by cyp3a4 and 3a5 and, to a lesser
extent, by cyp2d6, 1a2 and 2c9. cgp74588 showed in vitro potency similar to the parent imatinib. the plasma auc for this metabolite is about 15% of the
auc for imatinib. in addition, imatinib formed the major oxidative metabolite (m9) via n-oxidation on the piperazine ring.

4.2.5.3. imatinib
imatinib is a selective and potent protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that inhibits the bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx , the constitutive
abnormal  xxxg2198xxx  created by the philadelphia chromosome
abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia [255-258]. it has been
approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and
metastatic and unresectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors [256, 259-262]. the metabolism of imatinib is complicated.
its phase i metabolism pathways included n-demethylation (e.g.,
main metabolite cgp74588), piperazine ring oxidation with lactam
formation (apg049, apg050, m29.6, and m28.8), piperazine-n-4
oxidation (cgp71422), pyridine n-oxidation (cgp72383), and
benzylic hydroxylation (afn911) (fig. (33)) [263]. furthermore,
the loss of the piperazine moiety by oxidative deamination and
rapid further oxidation of the intermediate aldehyde to a carboxylic
acid led to the formation of the metabolite m42.2. phase ii metabolic routes included direct conjugation of imatinib and the ndesmethyl metabolite (cgp74588), resulting in m21.0 and m20.0a,
respectively, most probably at nitrogen, and glucuronidation of
oxidative metabolites [263]. following oral administration in
healthy volunteers, the t1/2 of imatinib and its major active metabolite, the n-demethyl derivative (cgp74588), are approximately 18
and 40 hr, respectively [263]. in vitro, imatinib was metabolized to
the active cgp74588 by cyp3a4 and 3a5 and, to a lesser extent,
by cyp2d6, 1a2 and 2c9 [264]. cgp74588 showed in vitro potency similar to the parent imatinib. the plasma auc for this me-

tabolite is about 15% of the auc for imatinib [263]. in addition,
imatinib formed the major oxidative metabolite (m9) via noxidation on the piperazine ring [265, 266]. imatinib is a potent
competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9, 2d6, and 3a4/5 with ki values of
27, 7.5 and 8 m, respectively [264].
4.2.5.4. tamoxifen
tamoxifen, a triphenylethyleneamine derivative, is one of the
most widely used selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms)
for the treatment of postmenopausal, hormone-sensitive, estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer [267, 268]. tamoxifen was first
approved in 1977 by the u.s. fda for the treatment of metastatic
breast cancer and breast cancer. other triphenylethylene serms,
analogs of tamoxifen, have been studied for breast cancer prevention and/or treatment, including  xxxd1941xxx  (3- xxxd91xxx )
[269-271],  xxxd2322xxx  (pyrrolidino-4-iodotamoxifen) [272-275], and
 xxxd2798xxx  [276].
tamoxifen undergoes extensive phase i and phase ii metabolism [277], and the concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites
in humans vary widely in patients. tamoxifen undergoes extensive
oxidation predominantly by various cyps to several primary and
secondary metabolites (fig. (34)). studies in women receiving 20
mg of 14c-tamoxifen have shown that 65% of the administered
dose in the conjugate form was excreted into the feces over 2
weeks, with unchanged drug and unconjugated metabolites accounting for <30% of the total fecal radioactivity [278, 279]. ta-

toward 4-hydroxylation at high tamoxifen concentrations [283].
although 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen represents less than 10% of
overall tamoxifen oxidation and 4-oh-tamoxifen is a relatively
minor metabolite, 4-oh-tamoxifen possesses 100-fold greater affinity for the  xxxg730xxx  and 30- to 100-fold greater potency in
inhibiting estrogen-dependent cell proliferation than tamoxifen
[286].

moxifen is considered as a prodrug, which must be converted into
active metabolites. early studies by jordan et al. (1977 & 1982)
[278, 280] have demonstrated that high first-pass metabolism of
tamoxifen resulted in a significant increase in its antiestrogenic
activity and characterized the first active primary metabolite, 4hydroxytamoxifen. the formation of 4-oh-tamoxifen from tamoxifen is mainly by cyp2d6 [281-285], with contributions from
cyp2c9 and 3a4 [284].  xxxg583xxx  also showed significant activity

(34). metabolism of tamoxifen by cyp3a4/5, 2d6 and 2c9. tamoxifen undergoes extensive phase i and phase ii metabolism and the concentrations of
tamoxifen and its metabolites in humans vary widely in patients. tamoxifen undergoes extensive oxidation predominantly by various cyps to several primary
and secondary metabolites. the formation of 4-oh-tamoxifen from tamoxifen is mainly by cyp2d6, with contributions from cyp2c9 and 3a4. the main
route of tamoxifen metabolism is through cyp3a4/5-mediated demethylation of the aminoethoxy side chain to n-desmethyltamoxifen. ndesmethyltamoxifen is further demethylated by cyp3a4/5 to n-desdimethyltamoxifen and then deaminated to deamino- xxxd91xxx . ndesmethyltamoxifen is para-hydroxylated mainly by cyp2d6 to its most abundant and therapeutically active metabolite endoxifen. endoxifen can also be
generated from 4- xxxd91xxx  via n-demethylation, but the 4-hydroxylation of n-desmethyltamoxifen by cyp2d6 appears to be the major source of
endoxifen production in vivo. 4-oh-tamoxifen also undergoes trans-cis isomerization mainly by  xxxg577xxx , with contribution from  xxxg583xxx  and 2c19. moreover, hydroxylation followed by conjugating reactions is a major metabolic route of tamoxifen.

3516 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

the main route of tamoxifen metabolism is through cyp3a4/5mediated demethylation of the aminoethoxy side chain to ndesmethyltamoxifen (fig. (34)) [287-289], which has twice the
half-life (about 14 days) as tamoxifen (about 5-7 days), and plasma
levels are usually 2 to 3-fold higher than those of tamoxifen [278].
n-desmethyltamoxifen is further demethylated by cyp3a4/5 to ndesdimethyltamoxifen and then deaminated to deaminohydroxytamoxifen (tamoxifen-ol), a glycol derivative with antiestrogenic activity [290-294]. in vitro studies have pointed to
cyp3a4 being the major catalyst of n-demethylation of tamoxifen
(fig. (34)) [283, 285, 295] with contributions from other cyps.
studies in recombinant enzymes indicate that tamoxifen ndemethylation is mediated by cyp2d6, 1a1, 1a2, and 3a4, at low
substrate concentrations, with contributions from  xxxg577xxx , 2c9,
2c19 and 3a5 at high concentrations [283].
n-desmethyltamoxifen is para-hydroxylated mainly by
cyp2d6 to its most abundant and therapeutically active metabolite
endoxifen (4-hydroxy-n-desmethyltamoxifen) (fig. (34)) [281285]. endoxifen can also be generated from 4- xxxd91xxx 
via n-demethylation [296], but the 4-hydroxylation of ndesmethyltamoxifen by cyp2d6 appears to be the major source of
endoxifen production in vivo. although both 4-oh-tamoxifen and
endoxifen are considered the major active metabolites of tamoxifen
that have potent antiestrogenic activity, endoxifen is considered to
play a more significant role in tamoxifen pharmacological activity
in vivo. cyp2d6 plays a critical role in the activation of tamoxifen
to endoxifen by sequential n-demethylation and 4-hydroxylation
[281-284, 296].
tamoxifen is also hydroxylated at the allylic position by
cyp3a4/5 to -oh-tamoxifen in humans and this metabolic pathway has been considered the initiation step in tamoxifen bioactivation to reactive species (fig. (34)) [297]. it has been proposed that
the -hydroxylated tamoxifen metabolites, which became osulfated forming the unstable  xxxd3258xxx  esters, are the reactive
tamoxifen intermediates that form carcinogenic dna-adducts [298300]. an interconversion between e- and z--oh-tamoxifen is
possible as a result of sulfation and the subsequent reaction with
water [299]. alternatively, tamoxifen undergoes o-dealkylation to
give cis/trans-1,2-diphenyl-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-but-1-ene, which
is estrogenic and readily detected in plasma (fig. (34)) [292]. like
4-oh-tamoxifen, cis/trans-metabolite e can be activated to form
dna adducts by rat uterine peroxidases [301]. in addition, fmo1
and fmo3 catalyze the formation of tamoxifen n-oxide in humans,
while  xxxg575xxx , 1a2,  xxxd577xxx , 2c8, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx , and 3a4 all
rapidly reduced tamoxifen n-oxide back to tamoxifen [302].
hydroxylation followed by phase ii conjugating reactions (e.g.
glucuronidation and sulfation) is a major metabolic route of tamoxifen (fig. (34)) [277]. after oral administration of tamoxifen, at
least four glucuronides of tamoxifen metabolites in human urine are
identified, including the glucuronides of 4-oh-tamoxifen, 4-oh-ndesmethyltamoxifen, 3,4-dihydroxytamoxifen, and a monohydroxyn-desmethyltamoxifen [277]. tamoxifen can be converted by
 xxxg2381xxx  to its n-glucuronide [303]. tamoxifen n-glucuronide had
binding affinity similar to tamoxifen [303]. n- and oglucuronidating activities of human liver microsomes toward trans4-oh-tamoxifen are comparable, but o-glucuronidation is predominant for cis-4-oh-tamoxifen conjugation [304]. only
 xxxg2381xxx  catalyzes the n-linked glucuronidation of 4-ohtamoxifen [305], but multiple ugts including ugt1a1, 1a6,
1a7, 1a8, 1a9, 1a10, 2b4, 2b7, 2b15, and  xxxd1873xxx  catalyze oglucuronidation of 4-oh-tamoxifen [304]. o-glucuronidation of 4oh-tamoxifen significantly decreased binding affinity for human
 xxxg730xxx , while 4-oh-tamoxifen n-glucuronide possessed
binding affinity similar to 4-oh-tamoxifen [304]. 4-oh-tamoxifen
is also conjugated by  xxxg2228xxx  ( xxxg2228xxx ), 1e1, and
2a1 and excreted into the urine and bile [306].

4.2.5.5. thalidomide
thalidomide (-phthalimidoglutarimide), a well-known teratogen, is increasingly used as an oral agent for the treatment of a variety of autoimmune-related diseases including erythema nodusum
leprosum [307-310], crohn's disease [311], and behcet’s syndrome
[312]. this compound has also been used to treat cancer such as
relapsed multiple myeloma [313-316], prostate cancer [317], lung
cancer [318], and renal carcinoma [319] and objective clinical responses have been observed in patients with multiple myeloma
[320, 321]. thalidomide is a derivative of  xxxd2431xxx  and contains two amide rings and a single chiral center. the r and senantiomers of thalidomide interconvert rapidly in plasma, with
protein binding of 55% and 65%, respectively [322, 323]. thalidomide mainly underwent rapid and spontaneous hydrolysis in aqueous medium at physiological ph and biological matrixes such as
plasma and blood [322, 324-327], whereas cyp2c-mediated metabolism plays a minor role in its elimination [328-332].
 xxxg575xxx /2,  xxxd851xxx , 2c9 and 2c19 are involved in the metabolism of
thalidomide (fig. (35)) [333]. thalidomide also undergoes bioactivation by peroxidases such as cox to free-radical intermediates
that produce reactive oxygen species, which may cause oxidative
damage to dna and other cellular macromolecules [334-336].
thalidomide is unstable in aqueous medium at physiological ph
and biological matrixes such as plasma and blood, undergoing rapid
and spontaneous hydrolysis [322, 324-327]. in vitro study indicates
that thalidomide is metabolized by cyp2c19, resulting in hydroxylated metabolites such as 5-oh, 5,6-dioh, 4,5-dioh and 5’-ohthalidomide [328-331]. thalidomide is a weak inhibitor of
cyp2c19 (ic50 = 270 m), but it enhances  xxxg592xxx -mediated
midazolam and cyclosporine metabolism [337].
4.2.5.6. trabectedin
trabectedin (previously known as ecteinascidin-743 or  xxxd3406xxx )
is a novel and potent anticancer drug approved in europe, russia
and south korea for the treatment of patients with advanced soft
tissue sarcoma who failed to respond to anthracycline or ifosfamide
chemotherapy, or who are unsuited to receive these agents [338345]. it is also undergoing clinical evaluations for the treatment of
breast, prostate, and pediatric sarcomas. the european medicines
agency and the u.s. fda have granted an orphan drug status to
trabectedin indicated for soft tissue sarcomas and ovarian cancer.
trabectedin is a marine alkaloid originally isolated from the
caribbean tunicate ecteinascidia turbinate. the mechanism of
action of trabectedin is unclear, but is believed to involve the
production of superoxide near the dna strand, resulting in dna
backbone cleavage and cell apoptosis. it binds covalently to guanine residues in the minor groove of the dna double helix in tumor
cells, triggering a cascade of events which include interference with
several transcription factors, dna binding proteins and repair
pathways, and disruption of the cell cycle and finally inducing
apoptosis of tumor cells [340, 346-352]. in the clinical setting, after
failure of standard treatment, trabectedin administered at 1.5 mg/m 2
in 24 hr continuous infusion every 21 days yielded an overall response rate of 8% and stabilization rates of 30-40%, some lasting
more than 3 years. [353] leiomyosarcomas, liposarcomas, and
synovial sarcomas appear the more sensitive histotypes.
structurally, trabectedin contains 3 tetrahydroquinoline
moieties, 8 rings including one 10-membered heterocyclic ring
containing a cystine residue, and 7 chiral centers. there have been
several in vitro and in vivo studies on the disposition and
pharmacokinetics of trabectedin. sparidans et al. (2001) [354] identified a few metabolites and degradation products of trabectedin in
human liver microsomes. the authors suggested that the main metabolites of trabectedin and its demethylated analog et-729 (m8b)
(fig. (36)) in human liver microsomes were formed due to remarkable breakdown of the molecules. in patient plasma, the drugs were
deacetylated and conjugated, yielding glucuronides of both trabect-

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

such as cox to free-radical intermediates that produce reactive oxygen species, which may cause oxidative damage to dna and other cellular macromolecules. moreover, thalidomide is 5- or 5’-hydroxylated by human cyp2c9; the 5-hydroxylated thalidomide can be further hydroxylated at position c-6 by
 xxxg575xxx , 2c9, and 2c19, resulting in 5,6-dihydroxythalidomide.

edin and et-729. however, analysis of urine, bile and plasma from
patients treated with trabectedin at the highest dose levels, did not
detect et-729 and metabolites observed in human liver microsomes. [354] the urinary excretion of trabectedin in patients was
<0.7% of the administered dose for a 24-hr infusion. reid et al.
(2002) [355] studied the metabolism of trabectedin in rat and human liver microsomes and identified three oxidative metabolites in
cdna-expressed cyp systems, including the n-demethylated me-

tabolite et729 (m8b) and two additional products. the authors
found that trabectedin was metabolized by cdna-expressed human
cyp3a4 and to a much lesser extent by cyp2c9, 2d6, and  xxxd851xxx .
further in vitro studies using pooled human liver microsomes
and supersomes have indicated that trabectedin (at 66 m) was
metabolized mainly by cyp3a4, but also by cyp2c9, 2c19, 2d6,
and  xxxd851xxx . [356] trabectedin showed the highest affinity for
cyp3a4 and the highest maximal metabolic rate for cyp2d6

(36). metabolism of trabectedin. trabectedin was extensively metabolized with a number of metabolites detected in patient urine and feces. trabectedin
was metabolized via various metabolic pathways. most of the metabolic conversions occurred at the trabectedin a domain including mono-oxidation (m11a)
and di-oxidation (m16b), carboxylic acid formation with and without additional oxidation (m16e and 8a, respectively), and demethylation either without ndemethylation to m8b/et-729 or with additional mono- (m4b and 6a), di- (m4a, 16d and 6b) or tri-oxidation (m8c). another metabolite (m16c) resulted from
o-demethylation at the trabectedin c subunit, and in addition, aliphatic ring opening of the methylene dioxybridge at the b domain yielded m9. both demethylation and oxidation represent major phase i metabolic routes of trabectedin. in addition, metabolism studies using the substrate depletion approach indicated
that human cdna expressed cyp1a2,  xxxd577xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c18, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx , 3a4 and 3a5, but not  xxxg577xxx , 2c19, and 4a11, metabolized trabectedin. in
monkey and human liver microsomes, trabectedin was not substantially metabolized by glucuronidation.

among the cyps found to metabolize this drug. in addition, the k m
value of trabectedin in female liver microsomes was significantly
lower compared to male liver microsomes, while the v max values
did not differ. the glucuronidation of trabectedin was catalyzed by
ugt2b15 observed in microsomes and s9 fraction. [356] trabectedin was conjugated by  xxxg1073xxx , but not by sults. however, polymorphism of genes encoding cyp2c9, 2c19, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx  and 3a4
and ugt2b15 did not correlated with the pharmacokinetics of
trabectedin in cancer patients [357].

cdna expressed cyp1a2,  xxxd577xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c18, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx ,
3a4 and 3a5, but not  xxxg577xxx , 2c19, and 4a11, metabolized trabectedin [358]. in monkey and human liver microsomes, trabectedin was not substantially metabolized by glucuronidation, suggesting a low affinity of trabectedin to ugt enzymes. [358] however,
with the exception of et-729, none of the proposed in vivo metabolites of trabectedin in patients identified by beumer et al. (2007)
[357] were detected in this in vitro study.

in contrast to the findings by sparidans et al. (2001) [354],
beumer et al. (2007) [357] found that trabectedin was extensively
metabolized with a number of metabolites detected in patient urine
and feces [357]. trabectedin, a glucuronide, et-745 (a dihydroxylated product), et-759a, etm-259, etm-217 and a proposed new
metabolite et-731 (an n-dealkylated metabolite of et-745) were
detected in patient’s urine and/or feces using lc-ms/ms. however, generation of these et- or etm-coded compounds via metabolic conversion is unlikely and it has not been described for any
structurally related compounds. it is conceivable that they may be
in fact artefacts resulting from fragmentation of trabectedin and/or
its metabolites in the source of the mass spectrometer, although
beumer et al. (2007) [357] argued that the unusual dehydroxylation
reaction may occur by intestinal bacterial flora.

the oral coumarin anticoagulants, including warfarin,  xxxd59xxx , and  xxxd2911xxx , are used for long-term treatment
and prevention of arterial and venous thromboembolic diseases
[359, 360]. they act as  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists inhibiting vitamin k1
2,3-epoxide reductase complex 1 (vcorc1, ec1.1.4.1) [361, 362].
vcorc1 plays a critical role in the regeneration of reduced  xxxd3522xxx  from the oxidized form in the liver and its inhibition depletes
the hepatic store of reduced  xxxd3522xxx  that is needed for the posttranslational -carboxylation of  xxxd2431xxx  residues on multiple
clotting factors, including factors ii, vii, ix and x and proteins c,
s and z [361, 362]. in certain european countries,  xxxd59xxx 
and  xxxd2911xxx  are preferentially used as oral anticoagulants,
while racemic warfarin is preferentially prescribed in north america, asia, england, and scandinavia [363]. oral anticoagulants exist
as s- and r-enantiomers and are administered orally as a racemate.
all three coumarin anticoagulants are metabolized extensively in
the liver to generate inactive, monohydroxylated metabolites, but
they show marked differences in metabolism and pharmacokinetics
[364]. the use of  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists is complicated by a narrow
therapeutic index and an unpredictable and variable dose-response
relationship, giving rise to frequent bleeding complications or insufficient anticoagulation.

vermier et al. (2009) [358] recently extensively studied the metabolism of trabectedin in monkey and human liver microsomes.
the authors found that the metabolite profiles of trabectedin at 5
m in cynomolgus monkey and human liver microsomes were
similar using 14c-radiolabeled drug, although there was a higher
abundance of the m4a/4b and m8b/8c metabolites in monkey fractions than in human fractions, suggesting a more active biotransformation of trabectedin via n-demethylation (to form m8b) and/or
via demethylation with additional mono-oxidation (to form m4b),
di-oxidation (to form m4a) or tri-oxidation (to form m8c) in monkeys than in humans [358]. trabectedin was metabolized via various metabolic pathways (fig. (36)). m6a was the result of a combined demethylation and oxidation reaction at the a domain of the
molecule, while m6b was likely the result from a demethylation
and a mono-oxidation combined with a loss of two hydrogen atoms
at the a domain of trabectedin. m8a was due to carboxylic acid
formation at the a domain of the molecule; while m8b (et-729)
was formed by n-demethylation and m8c was likely the result of
demethylation in combination with a triple oxidation, including an
oxidation of the carbinolamine moiety to an amide, at the trabectedin a domain [358]. m9 was thought to be the result of an aliphatic
ring opening at the methylene dioxybridge at the b subunit of trabectedin, whereas m16c was considered to be the result of an odemethylation reaction at the c domain of trabectedin. m11a resulted from a mono-oxidation at the  xxxg220xxx  of trabectedin. m16b
was the result of a double oxidation at the a domain of trabectedin;
m16d was thought to be the result of a demethylation and a monooxidation in combination with a loss of two hydrogen atoms at the
trabectedin a domain; m16e resulted from carboxylic acid formation in combination with a mono-oxidation at the  xxxg220xxx  of trabectedin.
overall, most of the metabolic conversions occurred at the traectedin a domain including mono-oxidation (m11a) and dioxidation (m16b), carboxylic acid formation with and without additional oxidation (m16e and 8a, respectively), and demethylation
either without n-demethylation to m8b/et-729 or with additional
mono- (m4b and 6a), di- (m4a, 16d and 6b) or tri-oxidation (m8c)
(fig. (36)) [358]. another metabolite (m16c) resulted from odemethylation at the trabectedin c subunit, and in addition, aliphatic ring opening of the methylene dioxybridge at the b domain
yielded m9. both demethylation and oxidation represent major
phase i metabolic routes of trabectedin. in addition, metabolism
studies using the substrate depletion approach indicated that human

4.2.6. anticoagulants

4.2.6.1.  xxxd59xxx 
 xxxd59xxx , a 4’-nitro analog of warfarin, is a short-acting
compound with a plasma half-life of about 8 hr, about one-fourth
the half-life of racemic warfarin [364]. like warfarin, the main
metabolic routes of racemic  xxxd59xxx  are 6- and 7hydroxylations (fig. (37)) [365]. the metabolic clearance of sacenocoumarol is high with a short plasma t1/2 of 2 hr, thus the
pharmacological effect lies almost exclusively with the renantiomer [366]. the high intrinsic clearance of s-  xxxd59xxx 
compared with r- xxxd59xxx  is mainly due to the low km values of the 6- and 7-hydroxylations [367]. only cyp2c9 hydroxylated s- and r- xxxd59xxx  at the 6-, 7-, and 8-position, and racenocoumarol was also metabolized by cyp1a2 (6hydroxylation) and cyp2c19 (6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations) [368].
cyp2c9*3 was associated with a 25% dose reduction and an increased risk of over-anticoagulation in italian patients [369]. presence of at least one cyp2c9*3 allele led to the most pronounced
reduction in the required mean dose in 98 greek patients [370].
4.2.6.2.  xxxd2911xxx 
 xxxd2911xxx , a derivative of coumarin, is used for the
prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders [371].
about 40% of an orally administered dose is excreted in urine or
faeces as conjugated  xxxd2911xxx  and independently from hepatic hydroxylation; whereas the remaining 60% are eliminated as
conjugated 4’-, 6-, or 7-hydroxy- xxxd2911xxx  (fig. (38)) [372].
 xxxd2911xxx  is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism to
monohydroxylated metabolites that do not significantly contribute
to the anticoagulant effect [372]. it undergoes cyp2c9-mediated
4’-, 6- and 7-hydroxylation, with contribution from cyp3a4 [373].
7-hydroxylation is the most important route, whereas 8hydroxylation is a minor pathway [61]. all hydroxylated metabolites are conjugated to their glucuronides and sulfates which are
detected in human plasma and urine. human recombinant cyp2c9
catalysed the 4’-, 6-, 7- and 8-hydroxylation for s- xxxd2911xxx ,

fig. (39). metabolism of  xxxd990xxx  by cyp2c9 and other cyps. warfarin exhibits stereo-selective and regio-selective metabolism, with  xxxd990xxx  predominantly by cyp2c9 to result in the 6- and 7-hydroxylated metabolites and r-warfarin being metabolized mainly by  xxxg575xxx , 1a2 and 3a4 to the 6-, 8- and 10hydroxylated metabolites. the hydroxylated metabolites of  xxxd990xxx  can be further conjugated by phase ii enzymes and excreted into the bile and urine.

but the total metabolite formation under identical experimental
conditions has been shown to be 5-fold lower than that of swarfarin [61]. in human liver microsomes, the s- xxxd2911xxx 
hydroxylation rate was higher than the r-enantiomer. individual
s:r ratios of each reaction were 2.7 (4’-hydroxylation), 1.6 (6hydroxylation) and 5.9 (7-hydroxylation). stereo- and regioselectivity of the respective hydroxylation reactions appeared much
less pronounced for  xxxd2911xxx  than for warfarin. cyp2c9 is
a major catalyst of the 6- and 7-hydroxylation for both enantiomers
of  xxxd2911xxx  [373]. however,  xxxg586xxx  was equally important regarding the s-4’-hydroxylation. recombinant  xxxg586xxx  and
cyp2c9 were high-affinity catalysts (km <5 m), whereas
cyp3a4 showed a low affinity (km >100 m) [373]. the intrinsic
clearance of human recombinant cyp2c9.2 and cyp2c9.3 for the
s-7-hydroxylation was 28.9 and 50.9% lower than of cyp2c9.1,
respectively [374]. the auc of  xxxd2911xxx  metabolites after
oral intake of 12 mg racemic  xxxd2911xxx  was significantly
lower in individuals expressing the cyp2c9*2 or cyp2c9*3 allele
compared to those carrying the wild-type [374]. following a single
oral dose, a trend for decreased s- xxxd2911xxx  clearance was
observed with increasing number of cyp2c9 variant alleles in
healthy volunteers [375]. this was accompanied with a significantly lower s-7-hydroxylation capacity in carriers of cyp2c9*2 or
*3 variant alleles compared with subjects carrying the wild-type.
4.2.6.3. warfarin
warfarin is a  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist commonly used in thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarct, atrial fibrillation and stroke [376]. warfarin has a narrow

therapeutic window that can be monitored using the international
normalized ratio (inr) of prothrombin time. warfarin exists as a
racemic mixture of r- and s-enantiomers. the activity of the two
enantiomers towards vcorc1 differs, with  xxxd990xxx  being 3 to 5
times more potent than its congener and accounts for approximately
70% of the overall anticoagulant activity [377]. warfarin exhibits
stereo- and regio-selective metabolism, with  xxxd990xxx  being metabolized predominantly by cyp2c9 to result in the 6- and 7hydroxylated metabolites and r-warfarin mainly by  xxxg575xxx , 1a2
and 3a4 to the 6-, 8- and 10-hydroxylated metabolites (fig. (39) &
fig. (40)) [378, 379]. the hydroxylated metabolites of warfarin can
be further conjugated and excreted into the bile and urine [380].
unlike 4’-oh- and 8-oh-warfarin, 6- and 7-oh-warfarin were
primarily (>70%) excreted as glucuronides in patients treated with
racemic warfarin [381]. ugt1a1 is likely responsible for the formation of 6-o-glucuronide of warfarin, and  xxxg2380xxx  may also
contribute. the formation of 7-o-glucuronide of warafarin was
catalyzed by potentially five different ugt1as. in all cases, warfarin, 4'-oh-warfarin, 8-oh-warfarin, and the corresponding glucuronides were minor metabolites [381].
cyp2c9 plays a major role in the biotransformation of warfarin
(fig. (39) & fig. (40)). mutant alleles of the cyp2c9 gene have
been associated with slow hydroxylation of  xxxd990xxx  [382]. there
are two common allelic polymorphisms in the cyp2c9 gene, including cyp2c9*2 and *3 that encode enzymes that are approximately 12% and 5% as efficient as the wild-type, respectively, and
both have a substantial effect on the intrinsic clearance of warfarin
[383]. subjects who were homozygous for the cyp2c9*3 allele

3522 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

zhou et al.

showed a 90% reduction in the elimination of  xxxd990xxx  in comparison to subjects who were homozygous for the wild-type allele
[384]. impaired metabolism of a low therapeutic index drug such as
warfarin has important clinical implications. carriers of such polymorphisms require both smaller loading and maintenance doses and
have a 4-fold increase in risk of bleeding complications, particularly at the beginning of therapy [383]. an individual that requires a
low dose of warfarin is 6-fold more likely to be positive for one or

more of the variant alleles compared with the general population.
patients who are cyp2c9*3 homozygous require the lowest doses
[385]. pharmacogenetic testing of cyp2c9 would be useful to identify this subgroup of patients who have difficulty at the initiation of
warfarin therapy, and are potentially at a higher risk of haemorrhage. these findings clearly demonstrate the need for clinical assessment of cyp2c9 genotype when establishing optimal warfarin
therapy [386].

due to a decreased capacity to form the o-demethylated metabolites
[403].

4.2.8.1.  xxxd2568xxx 
 xxxd2568xxx  (3-methyl-5-phenyl-5-ethylhydantoin), an antiepileptic agent, is a well-recognized probe drug for the cyp2c19
phenotyping in vitro and in vivo (fig. (43)) [404-407]. as a chiral
drug,  xxxd2568xxx  undergoes stereo-selective metabolism with the
s-enantiomer being hydroxylated at the 4-position but also undergoing n-demethylation to an active metabolite nirvanol (i.e. 5-phenyl5-ethylhydantoin) [408-411]. the r-enantiomer is primarily ndemethylated [411]. in humans, the primary metabolic route of smephenytoin following a single 100-mg dose of the racemate is to
s-4-hydroxymephenytoin [410] via hydroxylation catalyzed by the
genetically polymorphic cyp2c19 [405, 412], and this constitutes
the basis for the most common in vitro and in vivo tests used to
determine the cyp2c19 activity [407]. during chronic therapeutic
use of the drug at doses of 100-600 mg/day, n-demethylation of smephenytoin to nirvanol is predominant [410], which is mainly

cyp2d6 is mainly responsible for the conversion of the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and nortriptyline to e-10hydroxyamitriptyline and e-10-hydroxynortriptyline via benzylic
hydroxylation, respectively, whereas demethylation of amitriptyline
to nortriptyline and of e-10-hydroxyamitriptyline to e-10hydroxynortriptyline is mainly catalysed by cyp2c19 and 2c9,
1a2 and 3a4 (fig. (41)) [387-390]. minor pathways are ndemethylation and 10-hydroxylation to the z-isomer of 10-ohamitriptyline and 10-oh-nortriptyline. the hydroxylation of nortriptyline by cyp2d6 is highly stereo-selective, mainly forming re-10-oh-nortriptyline [391, 392]. e-10-hydroxynortriptyline is
active, with approximately half the potency of the parent drug in
inhibiting noradrenaline reuptake and greatly decreased anticholinergic activity [393]. there was a significant correlation between
amitriptyline clearance and the  xxxd1818xxx  metabolic ratio in nonsmokers [394]. a significant correlation between total clearance of
nortriptyline via e-10 hydroxylation and the activity of cyp2d6 as

was also observed [395-397].

be relevant to total serum  xxxd2568xxx  concentrations observed after

fig. (44). metabolism of phenytoin (5,5- xxxd2924xxx ) by cyp2c9. following oral administration, four oxidative metabolites, s-5-(4p-hydroxyphenyl)5-phenylhydantoin (4’-hpph), 3’-hpph, 3’,4’-dihpph, and 3’,4’-dihydrodiol, have been identified in humans. phenytoin is mainly oxidized to 4’-hpph by
cyp2c9 and to a minor extent by cyp2c19. the relative contribution of cyp2c19 in phenytoin metabolism increases as phenytoin concentrations increase
leading to saturation of cyp2c9. cyp2c9 is largely responsible for formation of 4’-hpph, which is the primary urinary metabolite. cyp2c19 produces a
quantitatively less important metabolite, 3’-hpph.

catalyzed by  xxxg583xxx  and 2c9 [413, 414] at substrate concentrations that may be relevant to total serum  xxxd2568xxx  concentrations (40 g/ml or 183 m) observed after chronic clinical dosing
[411]. the estimated contribution of cyp2c9 at concentrations (125 m) achieved after a single 100-mg dose of racemic  xxxd2568xxx  is 30% of the rate of nirvanol formation. at concentrations of
>1,000 m, >90% of the rate could be explained by the low-affinity
 xxxg583xxx  activity [414]. therefore, the n-demethylation of smephenytoin to nirvanol may be a useful means of determining the
activity of  xxxg583xxx  in vitro when substrate concentrations of
>1,000 m are used, but it is unsuitable for phenotyping this isoform in vivo, where a substrate concentration of >1,000 m is
rarely achieved. s- xxxd2568xxx  and its hydroxylated metabolites
also resulted in several o-glucuronides and n3-glucuronide in humans [415].
4.2.8.2. phenytoin
phenytoin (5,5- xxxd2924xxx ) is widely used as an anticonvulsant drug. it exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics in humans.
following oral administration, four oxidative metabolites, s-5-(4phydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (4’-hpph), 3’-hpph, 3’,4’dihpph, and 3’,4’-dihydrodiol, have been identified in humans
[416]. phenytoin is mainly oxidized to 4’-hpph by cyp2c9 and to
a minor extent by cyp2c19 (fig. (44)) [16]. the relative contribution of cyp2c19 in phenytoin metabolism increases as phenytoin
concentrations increase leading to saturation of cyp2c9 [16].
cyp2c9 is largely responsible for formation of 4’-hpph, which is
the primary urinary metabolite. cyp2c19 produces a quantitatively
less important metabolite, 3’-hpph.
4.2.8.3.  xxxd3485xxx  (vpa)
 xxxd3485xxx  (2-propylpentanoic acid, vpa) has become the
most widely prescribed antiepileptic drug worldwide. it is also used
to treat other neurological and psychiatric disorders such as bipolar
affective disorder and migraine headache [417-419]. vpa is extensively metabolised by microsomal glucuronidation and mitochondrial -oxidation [420, 421], while cyp-dependent -oxidation is a

minor pathway (fig. (45)) [422-426]. the -oxidation is considered
to be an important bioactivation pathway, as the resultant metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-vpa), is a more potent hepatotoxin than the parent compound [427, 428].  xxxg582xxx  is involved
in the metabolism of vpa, with substantial contribution from
 xxxg583xxx  and 2c9 [429].
the resultant reactive metabolite, 4-ene-vpa, is a hepatotoxin.
the formation of 4-ene-vpa in humans is enhanced by coadministration of the phenytoin and carbamazepine (both cyp inducers),
and inhibited by stiripentol, a methylenedioxyphenyl derivative
[430]. 4-ene-vpa may be converted to a  xxxd1739xxx  (coa) ester,
then oxidized to form 2,4-diene-valproyl-coa (ie., the coa
thioester of 2,4-diene-vpa) [431, 432]. 2,4-diene-valproyl-coa
could be conjugated with gsh [433] or n- xxxd68xxx  [432,
434], which may impair cellular defense mechanisms and increase
susceptibility to toxic insults by depleting gsh. alternatively, 2,4diene-vpa may be generated via direct action of -oxidative enzymes on the vpa parent molecule. by this pathway, oxidation of
vpa may produce 2-ene-vpa, which can then either be desaturated by cyps to 2,4-diene-vpa, or transformed spontaneously to
3-ene-vpa which inhibits mitochondrial -oxidation enzymes
and/or depletes cellular gsh [435-438].
4.2.9. antifungal agents
4.2.9.1.  xxxd3314xxx 
 xxxd3314xxx  is an orally active allylamine derivative that has
antifungal activity against dermatophytes and many other pathogenic fungi and it acts by interference with ergosterol biosynthesis
through specific inhibition of fungal  xxxg2197xxx  [439-444].
 xxxd3314xxx  is widely distributed to various tissues including the
poorly perfused nail matrix in humans, and its systemic clearance is
primarily dependent on hepatic metabolism [445, 446]. the halflife of  xxxd3314xxx  ranges from 24 to 156 days, explaining the observed persistence of  xxxd3314xxx  in nails for longer than 252 days
[447]. the  xxxd3314xxx  metabolites represented four major pathways:
n-demethylation; deamination; alkyl side chain oxidation; and di-

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

hydrodiol formation (fig. (46)) [448]. at least seven cyps are involved in the metabolism of  xxxd3314xxx  based on data from inhibition studies and studies using recombinant cyps. cyp2c9, 1a2,
and 3a4 are the major enzymes for total metabolism. ndemethylation is primarily mediated by cyp2c9, 2c8, and 1a2;
dihydrodiol formation by cyp2c9 and 1a2; deamination by
cyp3a4; and side chain oxidation equally by cyp1a2, 2c8, 2c9,
and 2c19 [448].  xxxd3314xxx  has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline [449], caffeine [450], warfarin [451],
nifedipine [452], triazolam [453], midazolam [454], and cyclosporine [455].
4.2.9.2.  xxxd3528xxx 
 xxxd3528xxx  is a second-generation broad-spectrum triazole
antifungal agent, exhibiting potent activity against a broad spectrum
of clinically significant pathogens, including aspergillus, candida,
scedosporium and fusarium species [456, 457]. like other azole
antifungal agents such as fluconazole and itraconazole, its primary
mode of action is inhibition of fungal cytochrome p450-dependent
14-sterol demethylase, an essential enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis [458].  xxxd3528xxx  is moderately lipophilic (log d7.4 = 1.8)

and a single diastereomer with r- and s-stereochemistry by virtue
of two chiral centers (2r, 3s).  xxxd3528xxx  is extensively metabolized by the liver with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged [459]. n-oxidation of the fluoropyrimidine ring, its hydroxylation, and hydroxylation of the adjacent methyl group are the
known pathways of  xxxd3528xxx  oxidative metabolism, with the noxide being the major circulating metabolite in human.  xxxd3528xxx  is mainly metabolized by cyp2c19 and 2c9 and to a lesser
extent by cyp3a4 and fmo1 and fmo3 to uk-121,265 (an noxide) and 4-hydroxylated metabolite (fig. (47)) [460-462]. uk121,265 is the major circulating metabolite of  xxxd3528xxx  in humans. cleavage of the n-oxide metabolite, uk-121,265, results in
loss of the fluoropyrimidine moiety to form uk-51,060. this metabolite was identified in rat, dog, and guinea pig. a glucuronide
conjugate (presumed to be formed via uk-215,364) was a major
metabolite in human urine (20% of the dose) [463]. the glucuronide conjugate of the hydroxylated fluoropyrimidine metabolite represented 16% of the dose in human urine. the considerable interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3528xxx  is partially due to cyp2c19 polymorphism [464], with poor metabolizers
having 2- to 6-fold higher aucs than extensive metabolizers [465].

fig. (46). metabolism of  xxxd3314xxx . the  xxxd3314xxx  metabolites represented four major pathways: n-demethylation; deamination; alkyl side chain oxidation;
and dihydrodiol formation. at least seven cyps are involved in the metabolism of  xxxd3314xxx  based on inhibition studies and studies using recombinant cyps.
cyp2c9, 1a2, and 3a4 are the major enzymes for total metabolism. n-demethylation is primarily mediated by cyp2c9, 2c8, and 1a2; dihydrodiol formation by cyp2c9 and 1a2; deamination by cyp3a4; and side chain oxidation equally by cyp1a2, 2c8, 2c9, and 2c19.

4.2.10. anti-hiv agents
most hiv protease inhibitors as well as non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors have been identified as high-affinity substrates, inducers and potent inhibitors of cyp3a4/3a5 [466]. their
binding affinity to cyp2c9 appears low; cyp2c9 appears play a
minor role in the metabolism of most anti-hiv agents. clinically
evaluated protease inhibitors include  xxxd239xxx , fosamprenavir,
lopinavir, darunavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir,
 xxxd166xxx , indinavir and kaletra (lopinavir plus ritonavir) (fig.
(48)). only  xxxd166xxx ,  xxxd239xxx , kaletra, indinavir, nelfinavir,
ritonavir and saquinavir have been approved by fda for clinical
use.  xxxd239xxx  is a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 [467]. ritonavir is
mainly metabolized by cyp3a4/5 and 2d6 (fig. (49)) [468, 469].
m1, m2 and m11 were formed by the decarbamoylation, hydroxylation of the isopropyl side chain and n-dealkylation, respectively,
in human liver microsomes [469]. m3 is an n-demethylated metabolite [468]. cyp3a4/3a5 formed m1, m2, m3 and m11, while
cyp2d6 only formed m3 [469]. indinavir is mainly metabolized
by cyp3a4 and 3a5 [468]. nelfinavir is mainly metabolized by
cyp3a4/3a5 and 2c19, but not cyp2c9. saquinavir and am-

prenavir are mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 [470, 471]. in addition,  xxxd166xxx , lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir, but
not indinavir, are mechanism-based inhibitors of cyp3a4 [472].
fda-approved selective non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors include delavirdine, efavirenza, and nevirapine (fig. (50))
for clinical use [473]. delavirdine is metabolically activated by
cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by 2d6 [474]. efavirenz is primarily
metabolized by  xxxg583xxx  [475].
4.2.10.1. nevirapine
nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
used to treat hiv-1 infection [476]. it has been approved by the
fda of usa for use in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as zidovudine and didanosine or protease
inhibitors (e.g., saquinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir) [477]. riska et
al. (1999) [478] have found that nevirapine is eliminated primarily
(>80%) in the urine as glucuronides of 2-, 3-, 8-, and 12hydroxynevirapine (fig. (51)). only a small fraction (< 5%) of the
radioactivity in urine was made up of parent compound and thus
renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent com-

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

cdna-expressed human hepatic cyps, 2- and 3-hydroxynevirapine were exclusively formed by cyp3a4/3a5 and  xxxg583xxx , respectively. multiple cdnaexpressed cyps produced 8- and 12-hydroxynevirapine, although cyp2d6 and 3a4 primarily catalyzed their formation, respectively. for the formation of 12oh-nevirapine,  xxxg592xxx , 2d6 and 2c9 (minor) also play a role; while  xxxg582xxx , 2b6, and 3a4 catalyzed 8-oh-nevirapine formation with a low activity.

and guinea pigs. in vitro studies indicate that azelastine was metabolized mainly by cyp3a4 and 2d6 via n-demethylation to desmethylazelastine, with minor
contribution from cyp1a2.

pound. in human liver microsomes, nevirapine is oxidized into at
least four metabolites: 2-, 3-, 8-, and 12-hydroxynevirapine [475,
479]. in studies with cdna-expressed human cyps, 2- and 3hydroxynevirapine were exclusively formed by cyp3a4/3a5 and
2b6, respectively [480]. multiple cdna-expressed cyps formed 8and 12-hydroxynevirapine, but cyp2d6 and 3a4 showed the highest activity, respectively [480]. for the formation of 12-ohnevirapine,  xxxg592xxx , 2d6 and 2c9 (minor) also play a role; while
 xxxg582xxx , 2b6, and 3a4 catalyzed 8-oh-nevirapine formation with
a low activity.
4.2.10.2. vicriviroc
vicriviroc (sch 417690), a novel ccr5 receptor antagonist,
can inhibit hiv-1 entry into target cells [481-483]. in hiv-1infected, treatment-experienced patients, vicriviroc showed potent
virologic suppression over 24 week [484]. after administration of a
single oral dose of [14c]-labeled vicriviroc to humans, m41 (sch
496903), m37, m35 (sch 727870), m15 (sch 495415), and
m2/m3 (sch 643188) were found to be the major circulating metabolites (fig. (52)), representing at least 5% of the circulating drugderived radioactivity in 4-, 8-, or 24-hr plasma samples. in human
liver microsomes and recombinant cyps, most metabolites of vicriviroc found in vivo have been dectected. m2/m3, m7 (sch
727390), and m15 were characterized as vicriviroc n-oxide, vicriviroc hydroxylamine, and o-desmethylvicriviroc, respectively [485].
other minor metabolites m16, m35b/m37a, and m45-m47 formed
by cyp3a4 were identified as n,n-desalkylvicriviroc, vicriviroc
carboxylic acid, and a series of monoxy-n-desalkyl-vicriviroc isomers. vicriviroc is mainly metabolized by cyp3a4, 3a5 and 2c9
[485], with recombinant cyp3a4 exhibiting the most activity followed by  xxxg592xxx  and 2c9. the major metabolite formed by
cyp2c9 was m15, whereas  xxxg592xxx  yielded m2/m3 and m41.
cyp3a4 resulted in the acid metabolite m35b/m37a (sch 727870)
[485].
4.2.11. antihistamines
4.2.11.1. azelastine
azelastine is a long-acting antiallergic and antiasthmatic drug,
possessing  xxxg1078xxx -blocking activity [486]. it is used
for the treatment of hay fever and as eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis. it also exhibited activities such as antagonism of the chemical mediators adenosine, leukotriene c4 (ltc4), ltd4, endothelin1, and platelet activation factor, and inhibition of the generation
and/or release of interleukin-1 and lts [486]. azelastine was
metabolized to desmethylazelastine, 6-hydroxyazelatine, 7-oxoazelastine,
4-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(5-methylamino-1-carboxy-2-pentyl)-1(2h)-phthalazinone,
and
4-[(4-chlorophenyl)
methyl]-2-(5-methylamino-1-carboxy-3-pentyl)-1(2h)-phthalazinone in rats and guinea pigs [487-490]. desmethylazelas-tine has
been also detected in human plasma as a metabolite of azelastine
after oral administration [491]. in vitro studies indicate that
azelastine was metabolized mainly by cyp3a4 and 2d6 via ndemethylation to n-desmethylazelastine, with minor contribution
from cyp1a2 (fig. (53)) [492]. the estimated contribution of

these three enzymes was 76.6, 21.8, and 3.9%, respectively. ndesmethylazelastine showed pharmacologic activity equivalent to
the parent drug. in microsomes from b-lymphoblast cells, cyp2d6,
1a1, 3a4, 2c19, 2c9, and 1a2 catalyzed azelastine ndemethylase, while microsomes from baculovirus-infected insect
cells, cyp2d6, 1a1, 1a2, 3a4, 3a5, 2c19, 2c9, and 2c8 catalyzed this reaction [492]. both azelastine and desmethylazelastine
inhibited cyp2c19 and 2d6 in vitro [493].
4.2.11.2.  xxxd1704xxx  and  xxxd2125xxx 
 xxxd1704xxx  and its fluorine derivative  xxxd2125xxx  are largely
metabolized by cyp2d6, with contribution from  xxxg583xxx  (fig.
(54) & fig. (55)) [494, 495]. cyp2d6 mainly catalyzed parahydroxylation of the cinnamyl phenyl rings of  xxxd1704xxx  and  xxxd2125xxx , and  xxxg583xxx  mediated that of the diphenylmethyl group
of  xxxd1704xxx . on the other hand, cyp2c9, 1a1, 1a2 and  xxxd577xxx 
mediated n-dealkylation at the 1- and 4-positions of the piperazine
ring of the two drugs, resulting m-1 and m-3, respectively, whereas
 xxxg586xxx , 2c19,  xxxd851xxx  or 3a4 did not show detectable activity for
these reactions [494]. the ring-hydroxylase activity of the cinnamyl
moiety of  xxxd1704xxx  and  xxxd2125xxx  in liver microsomes from
female dark agout rats (an rodent model for cyp2d6 deficiency)
are significantly lower than those from female wistar rats [496,
497]. both  xxxd1704xxx  and  xxxd2125xxx  are anti-histaminic drugs
which are mainly used for the control of vomiting due to motion
sickness [498, 499]. both drugs act by interfering with the signal
transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the
vomiting centre of the hypothalamus. the disparity of signal processing between inner ear motion receptors and the visual senses is
abolished, so that the confusion of brain whether the individual is
moving or standing is reduced. both  xxxd1704xxx  and  xxxd2125xxx 
could be regarded as nootropic drugs because of their vasorelaxating abilities resulting from calcium channel blocking activity
[500]. the major metabolic pathway in male rats was the oxidative
n-dealkylation to form bis(4-fluorophenyl)methanol and a number
of complementary metabolites of the cinnamylpiperazine moiety, of
which hippuric acid was the main one [501]. in female rats and
male dogs, however, hydroxy- xxxd2125xxx  was the main metabolite,
resulting from the aromatic hydroxylation of the phenyl ring of the
cinnamyl moiety. entero-hepatic circulation of bis(4fluorophenyl)methanol and hydroxy- xxxd2125xxx  was proved by
‘donor-acceptor’ coupling in rats; in bile and urine, these two metabolites were present mainly as glucuronides. the glucuronide of
hydroxy- xxxd2125xxx  was also the main plasma metabolite in dogs
[501].
4.2.11.3. diphenhydramine
diphenhydramine is an over-the-counter antihistamine, antiemetic, sedative, and hypnotic [502]. it may also be used for the
treatment of extrapyramidal side effects of typical antipsychotics,
such as the tremors caused by haloperidol [503]. diphenhydramine
is extensively metabolized by demethylation to n-desmethyl
diphenhydramine, followed by rapid demethylation to n,ndidesmethyl diphenhydramine which is further metabolized by
oxidative deamination to diphenylmethoxyacetic acid (fig. (56))

[504, 505]. these metabolic pathways are thought to be major
pathways in humans cyp1a2, 2c9, and 2c19 are low-affinity catalysing components for the n-demethylation of diphenhydramine, a

benzhydryloxy- xxxd2612xxx , is similar in ems and pms of
cyp2d6, suggesting that diphenhydramine is not extensively metabolized by this enzyme.

frovatriptan, naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan, and zomitriptan,
all selective agonists of 5-ht1b/1d receptor, have been shown to be

metabolized via n-demethylation by cyp2d6 and 3a4, and to a lesser extent by cyp2c9 and 2c19.

derived compounds [520]. except for frovatriptan, which is a carbazole derivative, all second-generation 5-ht1b/1d agonists are 3,5substituted tryptamine derivatives.  xxxd1976xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx  display both increased stability to first
pass metabolic inactivation by monoamine oxidase-a (mao-a)
and enhanced lipophilicity (4- to > 120-fold higher than sumatriptan), leading to increased oral bioavailability (2- to 5-fold more
than the 14% reported for oral sumatriptan) [512]. renal clearance
is the major route of elimination of frovatriptan, with 50% of the
dose excreted unchanged in the urine. the half-lives of naratriptan,
 xxxd1976xxx  and, in particular, frovatriptan (26 to 30 hr) are longer
than that of sumatriptan (2 hr) [521].  xxxd1976xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx  and
 xxxd3562xxx  have active metabolites, while lipophilicity is lowest
for almotriptan and sumatriptan [522]. almotriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  are metabolized by mao and multiple cyps, with the
involvement of cyp1a2 [523, 524].  xxxd3135xxx  is mainly metabolized by mao-a via oxidative deamination [525]. propranolol, but
not metoprolol and  xxxd2689xxx , increased its auc by 70% through
mao-a inhibition [526]. in vitro studies showed that propranolol,
but not metoprolol and  xxxd2689xxx , significantly inhibited the production of the indole-acetic acid metabolite of  xxxd3135xxx  and sumatriptan. the major metabolite of sumatriptan was an indole acetic
acid analogue which was pharmacologically inactive and excreted
in the urine as the free acid and its ester glucuronide conjugate
[527, 528].
4.2.12.1.  xxxd1976xxx 
 xxxd1976xxx 
[(r)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-5-[2(phenylsulfonyl)ethyl]-1h-indole] is a is a selective agonist of 5ht1b/1d receptors, used in the treatment of migraine [512]. in the
rat, dog, and human,  xxxd1976xxx  was rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized. the oral bioavailability of  xxxd1976xxx  is about
50%, with a moderate half-life (4 hr). it has the highest lipophilicity
among all the ‘triptans’ with a logd of 0.5. the major metabolic
route of  xxxd1976xxx  is pyrrolidine n-demethylation to ndesmethyleletriptan, together with n-oxidation, oxidation of the
pyrrolidine ring, and formation of tetracyclic quaternary ammonium
metabolites (fig. (58)) [529]. in vitro studies have indicated that
 xxxd1976xxx  was metabolized via n-demethylation by cyp2d6 and
3a4, and to a lesser extent by cyp2c9 and 2c19 [530]. recombinant cyp2d6 and 3a4 showed a high activity toward  xxxd1976xxx ,
followed by recombinant cyp2c9 and 2c19, while recombinant
cyp1a2 and 2c8 exhibited a low activity only [530]. both erythromycin and ketoconazole (both strong inhibitors of cyp3a4)
significant increased the cmax (2- and 2.7-fold) and auc (3.6- and
5.9-fold) of  xxxd1976xxx .

4.2.13. antiplatelet agents: thienopyridine  xxxd80xxx -receptor antagonists
4.2.13.1. ticlopidine
ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel belong to the same
chemical family of thienopyridine  xxxd80xxx  (adp)receptor antagonists [531-533]. ticlopidine is a potent and longacting inhibitor of platelet aggregation acting through inhibition of
the  xxxg1645xxx  receptor [534]. although effective in preventing
atherothrombotic events in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and
peripheral vascular diseases [535], ticlopidine causes a relatively
high incidence of hematological and liver toxicities [536-538]. the
major metabolic routes of ticlopidine in vivo are n-dealkylation, noxidation (to form m7), and oxidation of the thiophene ring (fig.
(59)) [539]. in vitro metabolism of ticlopidine by recombinant human cyp2c19 and 2d6 has led to the identification of thiophenes-oxide dimer (m2) and 2-oxoticlopidine (m4) [540]. 2oxoticlopidine is further converted into a carboxylic acid derivative
which is the active metabolite binding to the  xxxg1645xxx  receptor. the
active metabolite of ticlopidine contains a thiol group which binds
to a  xxxd1788xxx  on the  xxxg1645xxx  receptor and irreversibly blocks
adp binding and receptor activation. once this blocking has occurred, platelets are affected for their entire lifespan of approximately 7-10 days. ticlopidine undergoes myeloperoxidase (mpo)catalyzed oxidation, resulting in dehydrogenated ticlopidine and 2chloroticlopidine metabolites [541]. ticlopidine can also be oxidized to the corresponding dihydrothienopyridinium (m5) and
thienopyridinium (m6) metabolites [542]. the formation of m5 and
m6 is catalyzed by cyp3a4 and 2c19 as well as by peroxidases
such as mpo. cyp1a2, 2c9 and 2d6 also catalyzed the formation
of m5 and m6 but to a lesser extent. m5 was converted to m8 (a
lactam analog of ticlopidine) by cyp3a4 only. cyp2c19 is also
involved in the oxidation of the tetrahydropyridine moiety of ticlopidine to form m3 and m9, in addition to the thiophene ring
[542]. however, ticlopidine is a poor substrate of mao-a and
mao-b, with low activity for m5 and m6 formation [542]. ticlopidine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cyp2c19 and a known
competitive inhibitor of cyp2d6 [540, 543]. the keto tautomer of
2-hydroxyticlopidine and the dimers of ticlopidine s-oxide can bind
covalent to cyp2c19 and inactivate it. the mechanism-based inhibition of cyp2c19 may contribute to the reduced phenytoin clearance and increased toxicity by ticlopidine [544, 545].
4.2.13.2. clopidogrel
clopidogrel is structurally similar to other thienopyridines including ticlopidine and prasugrel. clopidogrel reduces the risk of
thrombotic events in patients with a history of artherosclerotic dis-

ticlopidine s-oxide dimer (m2)

(59). metabolism of ticlopidine. the major metabolic routes of ticlopidine in vivo are n-dealkylation, n-oxidation (to form m7), and oxidation of the
thiophene ring. in vitro metabolism of ticlopidine by recombinant human cyp2c19 and 2d6 has led to the identification of thiophene-s-oxide dimer (m2) and
2-oxoticlopidine (m4). 2-oxoticlopidine is further converted into a carboxylic acid derivative which is the active metabolite binding to the  xxxg1645xxx  receptor.
ticlopidine undergoes mpo-catalyzed oxidation, resulting in dehydrogenated ticlopidine and 2-chloroticlopidine metabolites. ticlopidine can also be oxidized
to the corresponding dihydrothienopyridinium (m5) and thienopyridinium (m6) metabolites. the formation of m5 and m6 is catalyzed by cyp3a4 and 2c19
as well as by peroxidases including mpo and hrp. cyp1a2, 2c9 and 2d6 also catalyzed the formation of m5 and m6 but to a lesser extent. m5 was converted to m8 (a lactam analog of ticlopidine) by cyp3a4 only. cyp2c19 is also involved in the oxidation of the tetrahydropyridine moiety of ticlopidine to
form m3 and m9, in addition to the thiophene ring. however, ticlopidine is a poor substrate of mao-a and mao-b, with low activity for m5 and m6 formation.

eases, such as stroke or myocardial infarction [546-548]. clopidogrel was particularly effective at reducing the occurrence of
ischemic events in patients having a history of cardiac surgery with
a relative risk reduction of 22% when compared with aspirin [549].
following oral administration, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed.
following an oral dose of 14c-labeled clopidogrel in humans, 50%
was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the 5 days after
dosing. as a prodrug, clopidogrel is metabolized by cyps to active
metabolite that irreversibly inhibits the platelet  xxxg1645xxx   xxxg1645xxx 
[533, 550]. however, only a small proportion (15%) of administered clopidogrel is metabolized by cyps, whereas the majority of
clopidogrel is hydrolyzed by esterases to an inactive carboxylic acid
derivative that accounts for 85% of the clopidogrel-related compounds circulating in plasma. clopidogrel itself is not detected in
plasma. multiple cyps catalyze the oxidation of the thiophene ring
of clopidogrel to 2-oxoclopidogrel which is then hydrolyzed by
opening of the thiophene ring to form both a carboxyl and a thiol
group (fig. (60)) [551]. the thiol group forms a disulfide bond with
the  xxxg1645xxx   xxxg1645xxx  on platelets. adp cannot bind to the covalently modified receptor, which normally activates the glycoprotein
 xxxg1202xxx /iiia complex that binds fibrinogen thereby initiating clot

formation. cyp3a4 and 3a5 appear to have the primary role, with
less involvement from  xxxg583xxx  and 1a2 [552]. in addition,
cyp2c9 and 2c19 are also involved. cyp3a4 and 3a5 expressed
in insect cells metabolized clopidogrel at a significantly higher rate
than cyp1a2 and 2b6 [552].
4.2.13.3. prasugrel
prasugrel (ly640315) is a novel third-generation thienopyridine antiplatelet prodrug that is administered orally as a racemic
mixture [553-557]. it is rapidly metabolized in vivo to a potent
 xxxg1645xxx  antagonist, designated r-138727 (2-[1-[2cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4-mercapto-3piperidiny lidene]acetic acid) [558], which binds irreversibly to
 xxxg1645xxx  adp-receptors, causing inhibition of platelet aggregation
that persists for the life of the platelets [559, 560]. prasugrel is rapidly hydrolyzed by human carboxylesterases 1 and 2 [561] to yield
the
thiolactone,
r-95913
(2-[2-oxo-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2c]pyridin-5(4h)-yl]-1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-fluorophenyl)ethanone)
(fig. (61)), which circulates in human plasma, whereas prasugrel is
not detected in human plasma [555, 562]. further metabolism of r95913 yields a ring-opened form, r-138727 [563, 564], which has

cyp3a4 and 2b6, with roles for cyp2c9, 2c19 and 2d6 (10-20%
contribution) [565]. r-95913 inhibited cyp2c9, 2c19, 2d6, and
3a4, with ki values ranging from 7.2 to 82 m, but did not inhibit
cyp1a2 [565].
4.2.14. antipsychotics
4.2.14.1. clozapine
clozapine is the first atypical antipsychotics developed and was
first introduced in europe in 1971, but was voluntarily withdrawn
by the manufacturer in 1975 after it was shown to cause agranulocytosis that led to death in some clozapine-treated patients. in 1989,
the fda approved clozapine’s use but only for treatment-resistant
schizophrenia based on the results that it was more effective than

any other antipsychotic for treating schizophrenia. the main metabolic pathways of clozapine consist of n-demethylation and noxide formation [566]. cyp1a2, 3a4, 2c9, 2c19, and 2d6 ndemethylated clozapine, while n-oxide formation was catalyzed by
cyp3a4, 1a2, and fmo3 (fig. (62)) [567-571]. the estimated
contribution of cyp1a2, 2c19, 3a4, 2c9, and 2d6 amounted to
30, 24, 22, 12, and 6%, respectively, with regard to the ndemethylation of clozapine in human liver microsomes [571].
cyp2d6 might play a role in the formation of metabolites other
than n-demethylclozapine and the n-oxide [572]. in vivo studies
have supported a role for cyp1a2, but no association has been
found for metabolizer status with regard to cyp2d6 or cyp2c19.
in addition, clozapine is extensively glucuronidated in vitro and in
vivo by  xxxg2381xxx  [573].

fig. (62). metabolism of clozapine. the main metabolic pathways of clozapine consist of n-demethylation and n-oxide formation. cyp1a2, 3a4, 2c9, 2c19,
and 2d6 n-demethylated clozapine, while n-oxide formation was catalyzed by cyp3a4, 1a2, and fmo3. the estimated contribution of cyp1a2, 2c19,
3a4, 2c9, and 2d6 amounted to 30, 24, 22, 12, and 6%, respectively, with regard to the n-demethylation of clozapine in human liver microsomes. cyp2d6
might play a role in the formation of metabolites other than n-demethylclozapine and the n-oxide. in vivo studies have supported a role for cyp1a2, but no
association has been found for metabolizer status with regard to  xxxd1818xxx  (cyp2d6) or s- xxxd2568xxx  (cyp2c19). in addition, clozapine is extensively
glucuronidated in vitro and in vivo by  xxxg2381xxx .

treatment of patients with acute and chronic schizophrenia [574,
575]. haloperidol undergoes extensive metabolism involving various cyps (mainly cyp3a4), carbonyl reductase and ugts, with
direct glucuronidation being the predominant elimination pathway
and followed by the reduction of haloperidol to reduced haloperidol
and by cyp-mediated oxidation. haloperidol is reduced by cytosolic carbonyl reductase to reduced form, which has 10 to 20% of the
activity of the parent molecule. reduced haloperidol is backoxidized to haloperidol primarily by cyp3a4 (fig. (63)) [576578]. n-dealkylation of haloperidol leads to the formation of 4-(4chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine, while dehydration of haloperidol results in 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. reduced haloperidol also
undergoes n-dealkylation by cyp3a4 and 2d6, 1a2, 2c9, 2b6
and  xxxd851xxx . reduced haloperidol also undergoes n-dealkylation by
cyp3a4, 2d6, 1a2, 2c9, 2b6 and  xxxd851xxx , and glucuronidation [577,
578]. pyridinium ions can be formed from reduced haloperidol and
haloperidol 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. it appears that cyp2d6
only plays a minor role for the disposition of haloperidol while
cyp3a4 is the most important enzyme for its overall disposition.
4.2.14.3.  xxxd3024xxx 
 xxxd3024xxx  is a member of phenothiazine class of antipsychotics. other phenothiazine derivatives as antipsychotics include
chlorpromazine,  xxxd3433xxx ,  xxxd2474xxx ,  xxxd2580xxx ,
thioridazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine,  xxxd3018xxx ,  xxxd2137xxx , and  xxxd3431xxx .  xxxd3024xxx  is the weakest blocker of dopamine d2 and ht2 receptors, but is a relatively potent antagonist
of adrenergic 1 and h1 receptors [579-582]. phenothiazines such as
 xxxd3024xxx  undergo mainly s-oxidation in the thiazine ring in position 5 and n-demethylation in a side chain, as well as aromatic
hydroxylation and n-oxidation (fig. (64)) [583]. in humans, ndemethylation and sulphoxidation are the primary metabolic routes
of  xxxd3024xxx  [584]. cyp1a2 and 3a4 are the main enzymes responsible for 5-sulphoxidation of  xxxd3024xxx , while cyp1a2 and
2c19 are the major enzymes that catalyse n-demethylation of pro-

mazine in human liver [585]. recombinant  xxxg575xxx , 2b6, 1a2,
2c9, 3a4,  xxxd851xxx ,  xxxd577xxx , 2d6 and 2c19 catalyzed 5-sulphoxidation and
cyp2c19, 2b6, 1a1, 1a2, 2d6, 3a4, 2c9,  xxxd851xxx ,  xxxd577xxx  mediated ndemethylation of  xxxd3024xxx . the highest intrinsic clearance
(vmax/km) was found for cyp1a2, 3a4 and 2b6 for 5sulphoxidation, and for cyp2c19, 1a2 and 2b6 for ndemethylation. cyp1a2 and 3a4 are the main enzymes responsible
for the 5-sulphoxidation of  xxxd3024xxx , while cyp1a2 and 2c19
are the primary enzymes that catalyse its n-demethylation in human
liver [585].  xxxg582xxx , 2b6, 2d6 and  xxxd851xxx  appear to play a minor
role in the metabolism of  xxxd3024xxx .
4.2.15. barbiturates
barbiturates, derivatives of barbituric acid, are used as
anxiolytics, hypnotics and anticonvulsants. barbiturates are still
widely used in surgical anesthesia, especially to induce anesthesia,
though their use during induction of anesthesia has largely been
supplanted by propofol. the principal mechanism of action of
barbiturates is believed to be their high affinity for the  xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa) receptor.
4.2.15.1.  xxxd2279xxx 
 xxxd2279xxx  is a barbiturate derivative with hypnotic and
sedative effects. it was used in the 1940-1950s as an agent for
inducing anesthesia in surgery and has a relatively fast onset of
effects and short duration of action. the major route of  xxxd2279xxx 
metabolism in humans involves hydroxylation at the 3’-position
followed by further oxidation to a 3’-keto metabolite by cytosolic
dehydrogenase (fig. (65)) [586].  xxxd2279xxx  3’-hydroxylation is
catalyzed by cyp2c9 and 2c19 [587, 588]. sulfaphenazole inhibited  xxxd2279xxx  3’-hydroxylation.  xxxd2279xxx  3’-hydroxylation
was correlated with cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation
[589, 590].  xxxd2279xxx  3’-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes and in vivo was also correlated with cyp2c19-mediated smephenytoin 4-hydroxylation [589, 590].  xxxd2279xxx  inhibited s-

single dose of  xxxd2279xxx  (300 mg), the 24-hr urinary excretion of
3’-hydroxy- and 3’-ketohexobarbital in a poor-metabolizer of
cyp2c19 was only one third of that in a subject of the extensivemetabolizer phenotype for 2c19 [590].
 xxxd2279xxx  shows a marked stereo-selective metabolism. (+) xxxd2279xxx  preferentially was transformed into -3’-hydroxyhexobarbital and the (-)-enantiomer preferentially transformed into
-3’-hydroxyhexobarbital in rat liver microsomes [591]. glucuronidation and dehydrogenation of 3’-hydroxyhexobarbital were also
stereo-selective and the s-configuration at the 3'-position was preferred. -3'-hydroxyhexobarbital from (-)- xxxd2279xxx  and the isomer from (+)- xxxd2279xxx  were preferentially conjugated with
glucuronic acid in rabbits, and was preferentially dehydrogenated to
yield 3'-oxohexobarbital by cytosolic dehydrogenases in rabbits and
guinea pigs [591]. in addition, 3’-oxohexobarbital was conjugated
with gsh to form 1, xxxd2279xxx  and a cyclohex-

enone-glutathione adduct. 1, xxxd2279xxx  was excreted
into the urine and the cyclohexenone-glutathione adduct into the
bile of rats dosed with  xxxd2279xxx  [591].
4.2.15.2. phenobarbital
phenobarbital, a long-acting barbiturate possessing anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties, is recommeded by world
health organization as first-line for partial and generalized tonicclonic seizures [592]. it is well absorbed, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 90%. phenobarbital is metabolized by
the liver, mainly through para-hydroxylation and conjugation
including glucuronidation (primary) and sulfation (fig. (66)) [593].
the para-hydroxylation was catalyzed by cyp2c9. the parahydroxylation pathway of phenobarbital cosegregated with the
cyp2c19-mediated s- xxxd2568xxx  hydroxylation in humans
[594]. however, the overall disposition kinetics of phenobarbital
was not different between poor and extensive metabolizers of

4.2.16. benzodiazepines
benzodiazepines are currently among the most frequently prescribed drugs over the world since they possess anxiolytic, sedative,
hypnotic, amnesic, antiepileptic and muscle-relaxant activities
[600-603]. the therapeutic properties are mediated via the
modulation of ionotropic gabaa receptors in the central nervous
system [604-607]. due to high safety and potency, benzodiazepines
largely replaced the barbiturates as the most commonly prescribed
sedative hypnotics. the commonly used include alprazolam,  xxxd369xxx , brotizolam,  xxxd1731xxx , diazepam, etizolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam and triazolam. most benzodiazepines contain the 5-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzo[e][1,4]diazepine
nucleus, with possible substitutents on the 1-, 2-, 3-, 7- and 2’positions [608]. some benzodiazepines (e.g.  xxxd1718xxx , arfendazam
and lofendazam) are based on the 5-phenyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]
[1,5]diazepine nucleus instead, while others have different aromatic
rings fused to the diazepine ring. despite their common chemical
structure, these drugs differ in their pharmacokinetic and metabolic
profiles [608]. in particular, they are biotransformed by different
cyps and ugts. cyp2c9 appears play a minor role in the metabolism of most benzodiazepines.
4.2.16.1. alprazolam
alprazolam, an intermediate-acting triazolobenzodiazepine, is
indicated for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, and the
short-term treatment of severe acute anxiety [609]. alprazolam
undergoes 4-hydroxylation primarily by cyp3a4 to 4-hydroxyalprazolam, while -hydroxyalprazolam is formed by  xxxg592xxx 
[610-614], with minor contribution from cyp2c9 and 2c19 (fig.
(67)). the resultant hydroxylated metabolites are further conjugated
via glucuronidation. alprazolam has been used as a probe for phe-

oxazepam

fig. (68). metabolism of diazepam by cyp3a4, 3a5, 2c9, and 2c19.  xxxd1866xxx  undergoes n-demethylation and 3-hydroxylation to form nordiazepam and temazepam respectively, and the metabolites are subsequently
converted to oxazepam. these pharmacologically active metabolites are
conjugated with glucuronide, and are excreted primarily in the urine. diazepam was significantly n-demethylated to nordiazepam by  xxxg583xxx , 2c9,
2c19, 3a4 and 3a5, with 2c19 exhibiting the highest rate at substrate
concentrations < 0.1 mm, and hydroxylated only by the latter three enzymes, with 3a5 being the most active. cyp2c19, 3a4 and 3a5 catalysed
the 3-hydroxylation of nordiazepam, and  xxxg583xxx , the 2cs and 3a4/3a5
catalysed the n-demethylation of temazepam. cyp3a4 exhibited the highest activity of nordiazepam 3-hydroxylation and temazepam ndemethylation.

notyping cyp3a4; plasma concentration ratios obtained between 1
and 48 hr postdosing correlated significantly to the corresponding
auc ratios for both alprazolam/4-hydroxyalprazolam and alprazolam/-hydroxyalprazolam [615]. fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of
cyp2c19 and 3a4, significantly increased alprazolam plasma
concentrations [616].
4.2.16.2. diazepam
diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative possessing anxiolytic,
anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, and amnestic properties [601]. it
binds to a specific subunit on the gabaa receptor at a site that is
distinct from the binding site of the endogenous gaba molecule
[606, 607]. it is commonly used for treatment of anxiety, insomnia,
seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine
withdrawal [604]. diazepam undergoes n-demethylation and 3hydroxylation to form nordiazepam and temazepam, respectively,
and the metabolites are subsequently converted to oxazepam (fig.
(68)). these pharmacologically active metabolites (all marketed as
drugs) are conjugated with glucuronic acid, and are excreted
primarily in the urine. several in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that the cyp2cs that hydroxylate s- xxxd2568xxx  is involved
in diazepam n-demethylation [617-619]. diazepam was significantly n-demethylated to nordiazepam by recombinant  xxxg583xxx ,
2c9, 2c19, 3a4 and 3a5, with 2c19 exhibiting the highest rate at
substrate concentrations < 0.1 mm, and hydroxylated only by the
latter three enzymes, with 3a5 being the most active [620] (fig.
(68)). the n-demethylation activity of diazepam by cyp2c19 at a
concentration of 20 m was six times of that by cyp3a4.
cyp2c19, 3a4 and 3a5 catalysed the 3-hydroxylation of nordi-

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

8-hydroxy carbazolyl carvedilol were detected for both the r- and s-enantiomers of carvedilol. 4’- and 5’-hydroxylations were mainly catalyzed by cyp2d6,
with minor contribution from  xxxg589xxx  and 2c9. cyp1a2 was the most significant hepatic enzyme for 8-hydroxylation of carvedilol, with contribution from
cyp3a4 and 1a1. in addition, cyp2c9 was the major enzyme for o-demethylation of carvedilol, but cyp2d6 and possibly cyp1a2 and  xxxg589xxx  also

diazepam n-demethylation by human liver microsomes correlated
with diazepam 3-hydroxylation, but not s- xxxd2568xxx  4’hydroxylation [620]. overall, multiple cyps are involved in the
metabolism of diazepam, resulting in active metabolites.
4.2.17.  -blockers
4.2.17.1. carvedilol
carvedilol is a non-selective -adrenoceptor antagonist with
vasodilating activity based on 1-blockade, available for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. this drug is used
clinically as a racemic mixture of r- and s-enantiomers. carvedilol
is extensively metabolized in man giving products from both oxidation and conjugation pathways [621]. in human liver microsomes,
4’- and 5’-hydroxyphenyl carvedilol, o-desmethylcarvedilol and 8hydroxy carbazolyl carvedilol were detected for both the r- and senantiomers of carvedilol (fig. (69)) [622]. 4’- and 5’-hydroxylations were mainly catalyzed by cyp2d6, with minor contribution
from  xxxg589xxx  and 2c9 [622]. cyp1a2 was the most significant
hepatic enzyme for 8-hydroxylation of carvedilol, with contribution
from cyp3a4 and 1a1. in addition, cyp2c9 was the major enzyme for o-demethylation of carvedilol, but cyp2d6 and possibly
cyp1a2 and  xxxg589xxx  also contribute to this pathway.

4.2.18. cannabinoid
4.2.18.1.  xxxd1943xxx  ( xxxd1943xxx )
 xxxd1943xxx  is the main psychoactive substance found in the cannabis (marijuana) plant [623]. it binds as a partial agonist to the
cannabinoid receptor cb1 in the central nervous system and the
cb2 receptor mainly present in a number of immune cells and in a
few neurones [624]. synthetic thc ( xxxd1943xxx ) is a schedule iii
drug in the us, available by prescription, considered to be nonnarcotic and to have a low risk of physical or mental dependence.
 xxxd1943xxx  has been approved by the fda in the treatment of anorexia in aids patients, as well as for refractory nausea and vomiting of patients undergoing chemotherapy [625-627].  xxxd1943xxx  is
metabolized mainly to 11-oh- xxxd1943xxx  by oxidation of the allylic
methyl group of  xxxd1943xxx  in humans (fig. (70)) [628, 629]. this
pharmacologically active metabolite is further oxidized to 11-nor-9carboxy- xxxd1943xxx .  xxxd1943xxx  is also converted to 7- and 8hydroxylation by cyp3a4 [630]. in addition,  xxxd1943xxx  undergoes
9,10-epoxidation to form 9,10-epoxyhexahydrocannabinol
(9,10-ehhc). in humans and animals, more than 100 metabolites could be identified, but 11-oh- xxxd1943xxx  and 11-nor-9-carboxy xxxd1943xxx  are the predominant metabolites [628]. metabolism occurs
mainly in the liver by cyp2c9, 2c19, and cyp3a4 [630, 631].
cyp2c9 and 3a4 are major enzymes involved in the 11hydroxylation and the 8-(or the 7-) hydroxylation of  xxxd1943xxx , respectively [630]. neither  xxxg584xxx  nor  xxxg586xxx  catalyzed the

urine is free 11-nor-9-carboxy-  xxxd1943xxx  and its glucuronides [628].
in the feces, 11-oh-  xxxd1943xxx  was a major metabolite detected.
sachse-seeboth et al. (2009) [632] recently investigated the
impact of cyp2c9 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of
orally administered  xxxd1943xxx  in 43 healthy volunteers. the median
auc of  xxxd1943xxx  was 3-fold higher and that of 11-nor-9-carboxy xxxd1943xxx  was 70% lower in carriers of the cyp2c9*3/*3 genotype
compared to those with the wild-type *1/*1 genotype. the result
demonstrates a gene-dose effect on thc and patients genotyped
with the cyp2c9*3 allele may need a dose reduction. however, the
pharmacological consequences of cyp2c9 polymorphisms are
difficult to predict since both the parent compound and the 11hydroxy-  xxxd1943xxx  possess psychotropic activities.
4.2.19. centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitors
several centrally acting cholinesterase (ec3.1.1.8) inhibitors
including tacrine [633], donepezil [634], and galantamine [635] are
metabolized by cyp2c9. however, these drugs are mainly metabolized by cyp1a2 and 3a4, with contributions from cyp2d6
[636].
4.2.19.1. donepezil
donepezil is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that exhibits
high specificity for centrally active cholinesterase and is widely
used in the treatment of alzheimer's disease [634, 637-643]. the

metabolism of donepezil was extensive in rats and involved odemethylation at each methoxy group of the dimethoxyindan moiety followed by o-glucuronide conjugation, aromatic hydroxylation
followed by sulfation, n-dealkylation at the piperidine ring, and noxidation at the piperidine ring (fig. (71)) [644]. since the demethylate at 6"-position of the dimethoxyindan (m1) was present in
larger amounts than that at 5"-position of the dimethoxyindan (m2)
in rat urine and feces, donepezil appeared to be demethylated with
position selectivity. the potency of m1 (and m3) in acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity is comparable with donepezil and
about 140-times higher than that of m2. m4 and m8 were formed
by oxidative n-dealkylation of the piperidine ring in donepezil.
similar to rats, three metabolic pathways were identified in humans: o-dealkylation and hydroxylation to metabolites m1 and m2,
with subsequent glucuronidation to metabolites m11 and m12;
hydrolysis to metabolite m4; and n-oxidation to metabolite m6
(fig. (71)) [645]. in human urine, the parent compound accounted
for 17% of the dose and the major metabolite was m4, followed by
the glucuronidated conjugates m11 and m12 [645]. in an experiment with 14c-donepezil and human microsomes the routes of metabolism were identified as n-dealkylation and o-demethylation
[646]. in human liver microsomes, m4 was formed mainly by
cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by cyp2c9 via n-dealkylation,
while m1 and m2 were formed by cyp3a4 and 2d6 [634]. a
clinical study has demonstrated that cyp2d6 ultrarapid patients
had lower plasma concentrations than extensive metabolizing patients and showed no clinical improvement [647].

4.2.20. calcium channel blockers

4.2.21. diuretics

4.2.20.1. verapamil

4.2.21.1.  xxxd3404xxx 

verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist, is commonly used for
the treatment of arrhythmias, angina and hypertension. verapamil
undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in low drug
bioavailability and considerable variability of therapeutic plasma
levels. the s-enantiomer of verapamil is stereoselectively cleared
during first-pass metabolism at a much faster rate than its antipode
[648]. verapamil is initially metabolized into two break-down
products, namely norverapamil and d-617 [2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-amino-2-isopropylvaleronitrile] (fig. (72)). these metabolites are subject to further metabolism by multiple cyps to
form additional secondary metabolites. kroemer et al. [649] reported the involvement of cyp3a4 and 1a2 in the n-dealkylation
(formation of d-617) and n-demethylation (formation of norverapamil) of verapamil. further studies indicated that cyp3a4, 3a5,
2c8, and to a minor extent  xxxd851xxx  are involved in the metabolism of
verapamil [650, 651].  xxxg586xxx  readily metabolized both s- and rverapamil to d-617, norverapamil and d-715 (also known as  xxxg2220xxx ). similarly, cyp3a4, 3a5 and 2c8 also mediated the metabolism of the enantiomers of norverapamil with minor contribution
from cyp2d6 and  xxxd851xxx . cyp3a4 and 3a5 readily formed the metabolite
d-620
[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylamino-2isopropylvaleronitrile] with generally a lower km and higher vmax
for s-norverapamil than for the r-enantiomer.  xxxg586xxx  produced
both d-620 and d-715 from the enantiomers of norverapamil, with
stereoselective preference for the s-enantiomer. verapamil is also
converted to d-702 [2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-isopropyl-6-azaoctanitrile] and odemethylverapamil (d-703) via o-demethylation. cyp2c9 and
2c18 are involved in formation of the o-demethylation products  xxxd703xxx  and d-702 whereas  xxxg586xxx  selectively formed d-703 [652].

 xxxd3404xxx  is a pyridine-sulfonylurea type loop diuretic used in
the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure
[653-656].  xxxd3404xxx  is well absorbed and yields a bioavailability
of about 80–90% [656].  xxxd3404xxx  undergoes extensive hepatic
metabolism in humans, resulting in three important metabolites
including m1, m5 and m3 with recoveries in urine of 10–12% for
m1, 30–44% for m5 and about 2% for m3 [656].  xxxd3404xxx  is
mainly metabolized by cyp2c9 via tolyl methyl hydroxylation to
the methyl-hydroxylated metabolite (m1) that is further carboxylated to metabolite m5 (fig. (73)) [657]. approximately 20% of
 xxxd3404xxx  is eliminated unchanged in the urine, whereas m1 and
m5 comprise 10 and 50% of a  xxxd3404xxx  dose excreted into the
urine, respectively [658]. a human study in 36 healthy subjects
showed 1.5-, 1.7 and 2.8-fold higher auc values of  xxxd3404xxx  in
individuals with the cyp2c9*1/*3, *2/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes, respectively, whereas those with the *1/*2 genotype had auc similar
to the wild-type [659]. the cyp2c9*3 allele was associated with
increased electrolyte excretion from 0 to 8 hr postdose and lower
 xxxd3472xxx  excretion over 24 hr postdose compared to the wild-type,
but no significant relationship between the number of cyp2c9*3
alleles and urine volume or sodium, chloride, or potassium excretion over 24 hr was observed [659].
4.2.22. endothelin receptor antagonists
4.2.22.1.  xxxd358xxx 
 xxxd358xxx , a specific and competitive endothelin receptor (et a
and etb) antagonist [660, 661], is the first oral drug for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [662, 663]. the absolute
oral bioavailability of  xxxd358xxx  in healthy volunteers is 50% and is
unaffected by food intake [664].  xxxd358xxx  has a low systemic

and d-617 [2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-amino-2-isopropylvaleronitrile]. these metabolites are subject to further metabolism by multiple cyps to form additional secondary metabolites. cyp3a4 and 1a2 are involved in the n-dealkylation (formation of d-617) and n-demethylation (formation of norverapamil).
further studies indicated that cyp3a4, 3a5, 2c8, and to a minor extent  xxxd851xxx  are involved in the metabolism of verapamil.  xxxg586xxx  readily metabolized both
s- and r-verapamil to d-617, norverapamil and d-715 (also known as pr-22). similarly, cyp3a4, 3a5 and 2c8 also mediated the metabolism of the enantiomers of norverapamil with minor contribution from cyp2d6 and  xxxd851xxx . cyp3a4 and 3a5 readily formed the metabolite d-620 [2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5methylamino-2-isopropylvaleronitrile].  xxxg586xxx  produced both d-620 and d-715 from the enantiomers of norverapamil, with stereo-selective preference for
the s-enantiomer. verapamil is also converted to d-702 [2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-isopropyl-6-azaoctanitrile]
and o-desmethylverapamil (d-703) via o-demethylation. cyp2c9 and 2c18 are involved in formation of the o-demethylation products d-703 and d-702
whereas  xxxg586xxx  selectively formed d-703.

plasma clearance of 17 l/hr with a volume of distribution of about
30 l [664]. after oral administration to humans,  xxxd358xxx  was almost entirely (>98%) bound to plasma albumin and primarily
eliminated through hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion of the metabolites, while its renal clearance was negligible
[665].  xxxd358xxx  and its active metabolite ro 48-5033 are substrates
of human organic anion transporting polypeptides ( xxxg2163xxx )
 xxxg2164xxx  and  xxxg2165xxx  [666].  xxxd358xxx  uptake into chinese
hamster ovary cells overexpressing these oatps was significantly
inhibited by cyclosporine, rifampicin and the pde5 inhibitor sildenafil [666]. rifampicin inhibited  xxxd358xxx  uptake mediated by
 xxxg2164xxx  and 1b3 with ic50 values of 3.2 and 1.6 m, respectively, and also showed a significantly inhibitory effect on the
 xxxg2165xxx -mediated uptake of ro 48-5033 with an ic50 of 0.8 m.
the ic50 values for cyclosporine against  xxxg2164xxx - and
 xxxg2165xxx -mediated  xxxd358xxx  uptake were 0.3 and 0.8 m, respectively, and 0.5 m for the  xxxg2165xxx -mediated uptake of ro 48-

5033 [666]. in addition, sildenafil inhibited the uptake of  xxxd358xxx 
by  xxxg2164xxx  and 1b3 with ic50 values of 1.5 and 0.8 m, respectively, and the uptake of ro 48-5033 by  xxxg2165xxx  with an ic50 of
4.0 m. in contrast,  xxxd358xxx  is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor
of p-glycoprotein (p-gp/ xxxg10xxx ) and it does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in humans [667, 668].
following oral administration,  xxxd358xxx  was converted to three
metabolites, namely, 4-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-n-[6-(2hydroxyethoxy)-5-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-[2,2’]bipyrimidinyl-4-yl]benzenesulfonamide
(ro

including m1, m5 and m3 with recoveries in urine of 10–12% for m1, 30–
44% for m5 and about 2% for m3.  xxxd3404xxx  is mainly metabolized by
cyp2c9 via tolyl methylhydroxylation to the methylhydroxylated metabolite (m1) that is further carboxylated to metabolite m5. approximately 20%
of  xxxd3404xxx  is eliminated unchanged in the urine, whereas m1 and m5
comprise 10 and 50% of a  xxxd3404xxx  dose excreted renally, respectively.

10% of that of the parent drug. ro 48-5033 as an active metabolite
may contribute 20% to the total response following administration
of  xxxd358xxx . the minor metabolite of  xxxd358xxx , ro 64-1056, was
generated through o-demethylation from ro 48-5033 or alterna-

tively from ro 47-8634 by methyl hydroxylation [669]. in humans,
the formation of ro 47-8634 and ro 48-5033 was catalyzed by
cyp3a4 and 2c9 [664]. the formation of ro 47-8634 by oxidative
demethylation of the guaiacol ether represented a small fraction
metabolized by cyp3a4 via o-demethylation.
administration of ketoconazole (a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor
with ki of 0.015 m) to healthy subjects increased the cmax and
auc to  xxxd358xxx  2.1- and 2.3-fold, respectively [670]. the plasma
levels of the three metabolites including ro 64-1056, ro 48-5033
and ro 47-8634 were decreased. when  xxxd358xxx  500 mg b.i.d. was
given in combination with cyclosporine 300 mg b.i.d. to healthy
volunteers, a 30-fold increase in trough concentrations of  xxxd358xxx 
was observed on day 1 when compared with volunteers receiving
 xxxd358xxx  alone [664]. this may be ascribed to the inhibition of both
cyp-mediated metabolism and  xxxg2163xxx -mediated hepatic uptake of
 xxxd358xxx .
on the other hand,  xxxd358xxx  decreased the plasma levels of cyclosporine, tadalafil,  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd2215xxx ), simvastatin and rand  xxxd990xxx , probably through induction of cyp2c9 and/or 3a4
[664, 671]. at the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily, the
trough concentration of  xxxd358xxx  decreased during the initial days
of treatment as a result of autoinduction of cyp2c9 and 3a4, leading to an about 40% lower exposure at steady-state [664]. these
results indicate that  xxxd358xxx  is a substrate and inducer of cyp2c9
and further studies are warranted to investigate the potential for
drug interactions.
4.2.23. hypnotics
4.2.23.1. zopiclone
zopiclone, a novel short-acting hypnotic agent and gaba receptor agonist binding to benzodiazepine receptor [672, 673], is
metabolized by  xxxg586xxx , 2c9 and 3a4 (fig. (75)) [23]. zopiclone
is a cyclopyrrolone derivative, belonging to a novel chemical class
(so-called ‘z’ drugs) which is structurally unrelated to existing
hypnotics. however, the pharmacological profile of zopiclone is
similar to that of the benzodiazepines [672]. after oral administrao

fig. (74). metabolism of  xxxd358xxx  by cyp2c9 and 3a4. following oral administration,  xxxd358xxx  was converted to three metabolites, namely, 4-(2-hydroxy1,1-dimethylethyl)-n-[6-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-5-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-[2,2’]bipyrimidinyl-4-yl]-benzenesulfonamide (ro 48-5033), 4-tert-butyl-n-[6-(2hydroxyethoxy)-5-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)-[2,2’]bipyrimidinyl-4-yl]-benzenesulfonamide (ro 47-8634) and 4-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-n-[6-(2hydroxyphenoxy)-5-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)-[2,2’]bipyrimidinyl-4-yl]-benzensulfonamide (ro 64-1056). the second major metabolite of  xxxd358xxx , ro 64-1056,
was generated through o-demethylation from ro 48-5033 or alternatively from ro 47-8634 by methyl hydroxylation. in humans, the formation of ro 47-8634

zopiclone n-oxide

(75). metabolism of zopiclone by  xxxg586xxx , 3a4 and 2c9. in humans, zopiclone’s elimination is mainly dependent on its hepatic clearance because only
3.6% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. zopiclone is extensively metabolized by the human liver into two major metabolites, n-oxide of zopiclone, which retains a low pharmacologic activity; and n-desmethylzopiclone, which is pharmacologically inactive. the n-oxide is mainly formed by
cyp3a4, 2c9, and 2c9, whereas n-demethylation is catalyzed by  xxxg586xxx , 2c9 and 3a4. in addition, 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and
excreted via the lungs. in urine, the n-demethyl and n-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the dose administered. zopiclone is used as a racemic mixture
and its disposition and pharmacokinetics in humans are stereo-selective.

tion, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability of 80%
[674]. the t1/2 of zopiclone ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hr. in humans,
zopiclone’s elimination is mainly dependent on its hepatic clearance with only 3.6-6% of the drug being excreted unchanged in the
urine [675-677]. zopiclone is extensively metabolized by the human liver into n-oxide of zopiclone, which retains a low pharmacologic activity in animals, and inactive n-desmethylzopiclone
[675, 676]. both metabolites are excreted by the kidneys, with apparent half-lives of 4.5 and 7.4 hr, respectively. in recombinant
cyps, cyp3a4 was the major enzyme involved in the n-oxide
formation, followed by cyp2c9 and 2c8, whereas  xxxg586xxx  was
the major cyp involved in zopiclone n-demethylation, followed by
cyp2c9 and 3a4 [23]. in addition, 50% of the administered dose
of zopiclone is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs as carbon
dioxide [674]. in urine, the n-demethyl and n-oxide metabolites
account for 30% of the dose administered. zopiclone is used as a
racemic mixture and its disposition and pharmacokinetics in humans are stereo-selective; only its s-enantiomer (markedt as
 xxxd2047xxx , “lunesta”) is pharmacologically active. after oral
administration of the racemic mixture, the cmax, auc and t1/2 values of the r-enantiomer are higher with slower total clearance and
smaller volume of distribution compared with the s-enantiomer
[674]. the s-enantiomers of zopiclone and its metabolites are always excreted in higher amounts than the r-enantiomers. moreover, erythromycin and itraconazole increased the auc of zopiclone
by 80% [678] and 73% [679], respectively; while rifampin decreased its cmax by 70.7% [680].

4.2.23.2. zolpidem
zolpidem is a short-acting non-benzodiazepine hypnotic that
potentiates gaba by binding to benzodiazepine receptors 1 subtype located on the gaba receptors [672, 681]. in humans, zolpidem undergoes extensive oxidation of c-methyl groups and hydroxylation of a position on the imidazolepyridine ring system;
none of the metabolites appears to be pharmacologically active
[682]. it is rapidly converted to its alcohol derivatives (m3 & m4)
mainly by cyp3a4, with contributions from cyp1a2 and 2d6
(fig. (76)) [683]. the alcohol derivatives are converted to carboxylic acids (m11), representing the main way of metabolism in humans. microsomes containing human cyp1a2, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6,
and 3a4 expressed by cdna-transfected human lymphoblastoid
cells mediated m3 formation from zolpidem in vitro [684]. the
kinetic profile for zolpidem metabolite m3 formation by each individual cytochrome was combined with estimated relative abundances based on immunological quantification, yielding projected
contributions to net intrinsic clearance of: 61% for 3a4, 22% for
2c9, 14% for 1a2, and <3% for 2d6 and 2c19 [684]. the formation of alcohol derivatives of zolpidem is rate-limiting and principally mediated by cyp3a4 followed by cyp2c9, while cyp1a2,
2d6, and 2c19 participate in alcohol formation but their contribution is minor. coadministration of haloperidol, cimetidine, ranitidine, chlorpromazine, warfarin, digoxin or flumazenil do not alter
the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem [682]. however, caffeine (a
cyp1a2 inhibitor) modestly increased the cmax and auc of zolpidem by 30-40% in healthy subjects [685]. ketoconazole increased

consistently, rifampin reduced the auc of zolpidem by 27% [687].
itraconazole and fluconazole had a small influence on zolpidem
clearance and hypnotic effect. fluoxetine treatment also produced
minimal alteration of zolpidem clearance in humans [688, 689].
4.2.24. leukotriene (lt) receptor d4 antagonists
by competitive binding to the cys-lt1 receptor, lt receptor
antagonist drugs such as montelukast,  xxxd3545xxx , and  xxxd2995xxx ,
block the effects of cys-lts and alleviate the symptoms of many
chronic diseases, especially bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis
[690].
4.2.24.1. montelukast
montelukast (mk-0476) is a potent and selective  xxxg599xxx 
antagonist [691-695] under clinical development for the treatment
of asthma [696, 697] and allergic rhinitis [698-701]. montelukast
undergoes extensive metabolism in humans, with only a small fraction of the dose being excreted as the parent drug in bile [702]. the
major metabolites identified in plasma and bile samples from experimental animals and humans include acyl glucuronide (m1),
diastereomeric sulfoxides (m2a and m2b), diastereomeric 21hydroxylated metabolites (m5a and m5b for s- and r-isomers, respectively), and diastereomeric methyl-hydroxylated metabolites
(m6a and m6b) (fig. (77)) [702]. human recombinant cyp3a4
showed a great capability to form m2a/b and m5a/b metabolites,
whereas it did not catalyze m6a/b formation [703]. in contrast, a
recombinant cyp2c9 formed m6a/b metabolites, but it had little
catalytic activity to form m2 and m5 metabolites. recombinant
 xxxg582xxx  also showed some catalytic activities to form m2 [703]. a
regio-selective hydroxylation by cyp3a4 and cyp2c9 was observed: cyp3a4 selectively catalyzed 21-hydroxylation, whereas
cyp2c9 mediated methyl-hydroxylation.

4.2.24.2.  xxxd3545xxx 
 xxxd3545xxx  is a selective and competitive peptide leukotriene
c4, d4 and e4 receptor antagonist indicated for mild to moderate
asthma [704]. structurally,  xxxd3545xxx  is similar to 3-methylindole
since it contains an n-methylindole moiety that has a 3-alkyl substituent on the indole ring.  xxxd3545xxx  is rapidly absorbed following
oral administration and is extensively metabolized in the liver
[705]. following oral administration of radiolabeled  xxxd3545xxx  to
healthy volunteers, urinary excretion accounted for approximately
10% of the dose and the remainder was excreted in feces. the metabolites of  xxxd3545xxx  were formed through five major pathways
[706]: a) cleavage of the carbamate linkage; b) hydroxylation at one
or more sites; c) n-demethylation at the indole nitrogen; d) nacetylation at the 5-aminoindole position; and e) cleavage of the
sulfonamide linkage. hydroxylation at the toluene ring and hydrolysis of the sulfonamide linkage were metabolic pathways found
only in animals. the most common metabolic products are hydroxylated metabolites which are excreted in the feces. the metabolites of  xxxd3545xxx  identified in plasma are at least 90 times less
potent as  xxxg599xxx  antagonists than  xxxd3545xxx . the formation
of hydroxylated metabolites was mediated by cyp2c9 and 3a4
(fig. (78)). cyp3a4 also catalyzed  xxxd3545xxx  dehydrogenation to
an electrophilic ,-unsaturated iminium intermediate that can covalently bind to macromolecules [707].  xxxd3545xxx  is a mechanismbased inhibitor of cyp3a4 characterized by a ki of 13.4 dm and
kinact of 0.026 min-1 [707]. it is a competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9
with ic50 of 7.0 m [708, 709] and 2c8 [710] in vitro. coadministration of multiple doses of  xxxd3545xxx  (160 mg/day) to steady-state
with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin resulted in a 63% increase in
the mean auc and 36% in the half-life of  xxxd990xxx  [705]. coadministration of a single dose of  xxxd3545xxx  with erythromycin (500
mg three times daily for 5 days) in asthmatic patients resulted in

substrate) in humans [711].
4.2.25.  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors
4.2.25.1.  xxxd3554xxx 
 xxxd3554xxx  is a potent and specific inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx 
[712] that catalyzes the formation of lts from  xxxd208xxx  and
is used for the prevention and chronic treatment of asthma [713,
714]. the drug is administered as a racemic mixture of r- and senantiomers. following oral administration to humans, several

 xxxd3554xxx  metabolites have been identified in human plasma and
urine. these include two diastereomeric o-glucuronide conjugates
as major metabolites and an n-dehydroxylated metabolite of  xxxd3554xxx  (fig. (79)) [715-717]. n-hydroxy glucuronidation was observed
in human liver microsomes [718]. the percentage of the administered  xxxd3554xxx  dose recovered in urine as glucuronides ranged from
73.1 to 76.5% [717], while the urinary excretion of the inactive ndehydroxylated metabolite and unchanged  xxxd3554xxx  each accounted
for <0.5% of the dose. in vitro studies have shown that  xxxd3554xxx  and
its n-dehydroxylated metabolite were metabolized by cyp1a2,
2c9 and 3a4 [719]. the two compounds were metabolized by parallel pathways to form the corresponding ring-hydroxylated product

4.2.26. muscarinic receptor antagonists
4.2.26.1.  xxxd3398xxx 
 xxxd3398xxx  is a relatively new muscarinic receptor antagonist
acting on m1, m2, m3, m4 and m5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors [720, 721]. it is used to treat urinary urge incontinence and
other symptoms associated with overactive bladder [721, 722].
other muscarinic receptor antagonists used for the treatment of
overactive bladder includ oxybutynin, trospium chloride,  xxxd1813xxx  and solifenacin. following oral administration,  xxxd3398xxx  is
rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and exhibits extensive first-pass metabolism [723]. in humans, 77% and 17% of an
administered oral dose of  xxxd3398xxx  was excreted in the urine and
feces, respectively, with the major metabolites being the 5carboxylic acids of  xxxd3398xxx , n-dealkylated  xxxd3398xxx , and their
glucuronides (fig. (80)) [723]. less than 1% of the parent compound is excreted unchanged and 5% to 14% (< 1% in cyp2c6
poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl
metabolite.  xxxd3398xxx  was converted into 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite that exhibits
an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of  xxxd3398xxx . further
metabolism led to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and n-

dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites via the aldehyde, accounting for 51% and 29% of the metabolites recovered in the
urine, respectively [723]. in human liver microsomes, the 5hydroxymethyl metabolite of  xxxd3398xxx  and n-dealkylated  xxxd3398xxx  were major metabolites [724].  xxxd3398xxx  is mainly
metabolized by cyp2d6, with signficant contribution from
cyp3a4, 2c9 and 2c19 [725]. fluoxetine (a cyp2d6 inhibitor)
increased the auc of  xxxd3398xxx  4.8-fold, and caused a 52%
decrease in cmax and a 20% decrease in auc of the active 5hydroxymethyl metabolite in patients [726]. in the presence of
ketoconazole, the mean cmax and auc of  xxxd3398xxx  increased by 2
and 2.5 fold, respectively, in healthy volunteers [727]. in healthy
volunteers, coadministration of  xxxd3398xxx  did not alter the
pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy volunteers [728]. warfarin
also did not affect the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3398xxx  and its active
5-hydroxymethyl metabolite [728].
4.2.27. non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
nsaids are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory effects. nsaids can be broadly classified based on
their chemical structure. acyl glucuronidation constitutes a major
portion of metabolic clearance of all carboxylic acid-containing
nsaids including naproxen, ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx , indomethacin,
niflumiac acid, and diclofenac [729-733].  xxxg2381xxx , 1a9 and 2b7
are the major enzymes for the glucuronidation of carboxylic acids

(79). metabolism of  xxxd3554xxx . following oral administration to humans, several  xxxd3554xxx  metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine.
these include two diastereomeric o-glucuronide conjugates as major metabolites and an n-dehydroxylated metabolite of  xxxd3554xxx . n-hydroxy glucuronidation
was observed in human liver microsomes. in vitro studies have shown that  xxxd3554xxx  and its n-dehydroxylated metabolite were metabolized by cyp1a2, 2c9
and 3a4. the two compounds were metabolized by parallel pathways to form the corresponding ring-hydroxylated product and diastereomer sulfoxide.
cyp1a2 and cyp2c9 catalyze ring hydroxylation, whereas sulfoxidation is catalyzed largely by cyp3a4.

[729-733]. cyp2c9 metabolizes a number of nsaids, including
diclofenac [122, 734, 735], ibuprofen [736],  xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd3265xxx 
[52], naproxen [58, 98, 737, 738],  xxxd2141xxx  [122],  xxxd2556xxx 
acid [739], indomethacin [740],  xxxd234xxx  [739], pirprofen
[739],  xxxd2561xxx  [741],  xxxd2969xxx  [98],  xxxd3311xxx  [742, 743], and
 xxxd2508xxx  (fig. (81)) [744-746]. the contribution of cyp2c9 in
the overall clearance of these drugs is variable. for example, 5’hydroxy  xxxd2969xxx  was the major metabolite accounting for about
60% of the dose and cyp2c9 played a primary (>90%) role in the
formation of 5’-hydroxy  xxxd2969xxx  [739]. however,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide was not metabolized by cyp2c9; its sulfoxidation was catalyzed by fmo3 [747].
4.2.27.1. aceclofenac
aceclofenac is an nsaid used for the relief of pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and ankylosing
spondylitis [748]. in cultured human hepatocytes and human liver
microsomes, aceclofenac was converted to its major metabolite 4’hydroxy derivative by cyp2c9 (fig. (82)) [749]. minor metabolites included 5-hydroxyaceclofenac, diclofenac, 5-hydroxydiclo-

fenac and 4’-hydroxydiclofenac [749]. these metabolites were
further conjugated via glucuronidation and sulfation. all these metabolites have been found in the human urine after aceclofenac administration [750]. aceclofenac was hydrolyzed to diclofenac
which undergoes further cyp2c9-mediated 4’-hydroxylation and

4.2.27.2. diclofenac
diclofenac is an arylalkanoic acid nsaid used to reduce inflammation and as an analgesic reducing pain in conditions such as
arthritis, gout attacks, mild to moderate post-operative or posttraumatic pain and menstrual pain. diclofenac is extensively metabolized in humans. five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine, including 4’-hydroxy, 5-hydroxy,
3’-hydroxy, 4’,5-dihydroxy and 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy diclofenac
(fig. (83)). diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation is primarily catalyzed by
cyp2c9, with contribution from cyp3a4 [122, 734, 735]. the
hydroxylated metabolites of diclofenac undergo further glucuronidation by ugt1a1, 1a6, 1a9, 2b7 (major) and 2b15 [731, 752]
and sulfation followed by biliary excretion. 4’-oh-diclofenac has

very weak pharmacologic activity. little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. approximately 65% of the dose is
excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites.
mancy et al. (1999) [753] investigated the hydroxylation of diclofenac and its two derivatives lacking the cooh function. compound 2 was derived from reduction of the cooh function of diclofenac to the ch2oh function. recombinant  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, 2c8,
2c9, 2c18, 2c19, 2d6, and 3a4 almost exclusively metabolized it
via 5-hydroxylation (fig. (84)). cyp2c19, 2c18, 2c8 and 2c9
were the most efficient catalysts for this reaction, with kcat/km values between 0.2 and 1.6 min-1/m [753]. oxidation of compound 2
with an iron porphyrin-based chemical model of cyp also led to a
product derived from the oxidation of compound 2 at position 5.
these results show that oxidation of diclofenac and its derivative 2
generally occurs at position 5. this position, para to the nh group
on the more electron-rich aromatic ring of diclofenac derivatives, is

thus the preferred site of reaction of electrophilic and oxidant species. however, diclofenac also formed 4’-oh-diclofenac by
cyp2c9, probabaly due to the presence of its cooh function
which can be orientated in the active site of 2c9 for this reaction
while cyp2c19, 2c18, and 2c8 would not lead to such a strict
positioning as they give rise to both 4’-oh- and 5-oh-diclofenac.

 xxxd2065xxx  is clinically used as the racemate.  xxxd2065xxx  is well absorbed and had a relative bioavailability of 100% [756]. following
oral administration, several metabolites have been identified in
human plasma and urine [757]. approximately 1% of an  xxxd2065xxx 
dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the urine with 71% of the
dose excreted into urine as phase i and phase ii metabolites [757].

ugt1a1, 1a3, 1a9, and 2b4. the conjugates of both  xxxd2141xxx  and 4’-oh- xxxd2141xxx  are excreted into urine, and approximately 20% of  xxxd2141xxx  is

the major metabolites include 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylated  xxxd2065xxx 
and  xxxd2065xxx  glucuronide in vitro and in vivo (fig. (85)). in human
liver microsomes,  xxxd2065xxx  was hydroxylated by cyp2c9 [758].
recombinant cyp2c9 showed the greatest activities for the 6- and
7-hydroxylation of s- and r- xxxd2065xxx , while recombinant cyp1a2,
 xxxd577xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx  and 3a4 exhibited about 1/5

exhibited stereo-selective pharmacokinetics after administration to

r- xxxd2065xxx  by ugt1as. in contrast, r- xxxd2065xxx  was hydroxylated

fig. (87). metabolism of r-ibuprofen. the major elimination pathway for ibuprofen is oxidation (70%) while conjugation only contributes to about 10%.
ibuprofen is used as a racemic mixture, but s-ibuprofen is primarily responsible for its cox inhibitory activity.  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 are the primary enzymes
responsible for the 2- and 3-hydroxylation of ibuprofen, while ugt1a1, 1a3, 1a9, 2b4, and 2b7 glucuronide ibuprofen. ibuprofen is converted by  xxxg586xxx 
and 2c9 to 2-oh- and 3-oh-ibuprofen, with enantio-selective metabolism. r-ibuprofen is hydroxylated at 2 and 3 positions by  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 to result in
r-2-oh-ibuprofen and two diastereomeric 3-oh-ibuprofen designated r, s- and r, r-3-oh-ibuprofen. recombinant cyp2c9 favors 2- and 3-hydroxylation
of s-ibuprofen, whereas  xxxg586xxx  favors 2-hydroxylation of r-ibuprofen. 3-oh-ibuprofen will undergoes dehydrogenation to 3-carboxyibuprofen in vivo.

 xxxd2141xxx  is primarily catalyzed by cyp2c9 (fig. (86)) [122,
768], resulting in 4’-oh- xxxd2141xxx  which has little antiinflammatory activity in animal models.  xxxd2141xxx  is primarily
glucuronidated by ugt2b7, with minor contribution from
ugt1a1, 1a3, 1a9, and 2b4 [729, 731]. the conjugates of both
 xxxd2141xxx  and 4’-oh- xxxd2141xxx  are excreted into urine, and
approximately 20% of  xxxd2141xxx  is eliminated unchanged [769,
770].
4.2.27.5. ibuprofen
ibuprofen is a commonly used 2-arylpropionate-type nsaid
that inhibits cox-1 and cox-2. it appears that the analgesic,
antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity of ibuprofen are
achieved principally through cox-2 inhibition; whereas cox-1
inhibition is responsible for its unwanted effects on platelet
aggregation and the gastrointestinal tract. the major elimination
pathway for ibuprofen is oxidation (70%) while conjugation only
contributes to about 10% [771]. ibuprofen is used as a racemic mixture, but s-ibuprofen is primarily responsible for its cox inhibitory
activity [772]. following oral administration of racemic ibuprofen,
approximately 60% of the dose is recovered in a 24-hr urine collection as 2-hydroxyibuprofen, 3-carboxyibuprofen and their conjugates [771].  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 are primarily responsible for the 2and 3-hydroxylation of ibuprofen (fig. (87) & fig. (88)) [736, 739],
while ugt1a1, 1a3, 1a9, 2b4, and 2b7 glucuronide ibuprofen
[731, 773]. ibuprofen is converted by  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 to 2-ohand 3-oh-ibuprofen, with enantio-selective metabolism [736]. ribuprofen is hydroxylated at 2 and 3 positions by  xxxg586xxx /2c9 to
r-2-oh-ibuprofen and two diastereomeric 3-oh-ibuprofen desig-

nated r,s- and r,r-3-oh-ibuprofen. for s-ibuprofen, oxidation of
2 and 3 positions gives rise to in s-2-oh-ibuprofen, s,s-3-ohibuprofen and s,r-3-oh-ibuprofen. recombinant cyp2c9 favors
2- and 3-hydroxylation of s-ibuprofen, whereas  xxxg586xxx  favors 2hydroxylation of r-ibuprofen. 3-oh-ibuprofen will undergoes dehydrogenation to 3-carboxyibuprofen in vivo. the plasma concentrations of ibuprofen [774-776]. a recent study with selective inhibitors and antibodies found that  xxxg586xxx  played a minor role in
r-ibuprofen (<10%) and s-ibuprofen (~13%) clearance [777]. thus,
 xxxg586xxx  inhibition and genotype would not greatly impact the
clearance of either enantiomer of ibuprofen. the auc of racemic
ibuprofen was 1.6- and 1.8-fold higher in individuals with the
cyp2c9*1/*3 and *3/*3 genotypes, respectively, due to increased
plasma s-ibuprofen concentrations. the cyp2c9*3 allele was also
associated with enhanced inhibition of cyclooxygenase ex vivo
[778]. the presence of one or two  xxxg586xxx *3 alleles which is in
linkage disequilibrium with cyp2c9*2 correlated with 1.7- and 1.8fold higher aucs of r-ibuprofen, respectively [775].
4.2.27.6. indomethacin
indomethacin is a commonly used nsaid of the arylalkanoic
acid class that inhibits both cox-1 and cox-2 used to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling [779]. it is extensively metabolized
via o-demethylation and n-deacylation into o-desmethylindomethacin, n-deschlorobenzoylindomethacin, and o-desmethyl-ndeschlorobenzoylindomethacin (fig. (89)) [780]. the carboxylesterase catalyzed the n-deacylation of indomethacin in pigs [781]. in
humans, o-desmethylindomethacin formation is critical to the
elimination of indomethacin, accounting to 40-55% of total drug

that cyp2c9 is the major catalyst for the o-demethylation of indomethacin, with minor contribution from cyp1a2, 2c19 and 2d6
[740]. in addition, indomethacin is glucuronidated by ugt1a1
[731].

tuted the rate-limiting steps in its clearance. the active metabolites,
2’-oxo- and 2’-hydroxy-lm-4108 and 1’-hydroxy-lm-4108 as
well, were all detected in rat plasma. the glucuronides of 2’hydroxy-lm-4108 and o-desmethyl-2’-hydroxy-lm-4108 were
also observed in the bile of rats [785].

derivatization of indomethacin to esters or amides yields molecules capable of binding tightly to cox-2 but not cox-1 [783]. a
variety of different amide or ester analogs of indomethacin have
been synthesized and many of these compounds have been shown to
be highly selective and potent cox-2 inhibitors [784]. indomethacin phenethylamide (2-[1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl1h-indol-3-yl]-n-phenethyl- xxxd63xxx , lm-4108) is a prototypical
compound in this series and exhibited an ic50 of 0.06 m for cox2, but did not inhibit cox-1 at concentrations as high as 66 m.
besides its non-ulcerogenic anti-inflammatory activity, lm-4108
may be effective in both the treatment and prevention of cancer. in
rat, mouse, and human liver microsomes, the primary site of oxidation was on the methylene carbons of the phenethyl side chain to
form the 1’- and 2’-hydroxy and 2’-oxo metabolites (fig. (90))
[785]. both the 2’-hydroxy-lm-4108 and 2’-oxo-lm-4108 metabolites were found to be equipotent to the parent compound with regard to cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity. cyp3a4 catalyzed side chain oxidation to form 1’-oh-, 2’-oh and 2’-oxo derivatives, while o-demethylation was a minor oxidative pathway in
contrast to the metabolism of indomethacin and was catalyzed by
cyp2d6 to form o-desmethyl metabolite with minor contributions
from cyp2c9 and 2c19 [785]. cyp2c19 also showed a low activity for 2’-hydroxylation of lm-4108 and o-demethylation of 2’oh-lm-4108. following intravenous administration of lm-4108
to rats, oxidative metabolism on the phenethyl side chain consti-

although lm-4108 is a potent and selective cox-2 inhibitor
(>1,000 fold over cox-1) and is devoid of the ulcerogenic effect
associated with the parent nsaid indomethacin [784], it was very
unstable in rat and human liver microsomes (t1/2 < 5 min vs >60
min for indomethacin) due to extensive cyp3a4- and 2d6mediated hydroxylation on the phenethyl group of the side chain
and o-demethylation [785]. lm-4108 (compound 1) has a short
half-life (<20 min) in rats after i.v. injection. the metabolic sites of
indomethacin and lm-4108 and the respective cyp enzymes were
accurately predicted by metasite [786], an in silico tool that can
identify the most likely sites of cyp-mediated oxidative metabolism of a compound based on the chemical reactivity of the substrate and enzyme-substrate similarity analysis [787]. for lm-4108,
metasite predicted that cyp3a4 and 2c9-mediated oxidations
would occur principally on the phenethyl substituent (benzylic ch 2
and para-position on the phenyl ring), and o-demethylation would
also take place by cyp3a4 and 2d6. however, experimental data
have indicated that aromatic ring hydroxylation did not occur and
only cyp2d6-catalyzed the o-demethylation [785]. to improve
metabolic stability, the authors virtually designed several analogues
of lm-4108 (compounds 2-4, fig. (91)), in which electron-deficient
(e.g. n-fluophenyl and n-fluoropyridinyl) or polar n-substituent
(glycine derivative 4) were introduced into lm-4108. upon presentation of compounds 2 to 4 to the metasite program, the prediction
in each case shifted from metabolism on the n-substituent to o-

in humans, o-desmethylindomethacin formation is critical to the elimination of indomethacin, accounting to 40 to 55% of total drug eliminated in the urine. in
vitro studies have demonstrated that cyp2c9 is the major catalyst for the o-demethylation of indomethacin, with minor contribution from cyp1a2, 2c19 and
2d6. in addition, indomethacin is glucuronidated by ugt1a1.

and 2d6 for compounds 2 and 3 and cyp3a4, 2d6 and 2c9 for the
carboxylic acid derivative 4. the predictions were accurate and
were validated by in vitro metabolism data in human liver microsomes [786]. o-demethylation was found to be an almost exclusive
pathway for the three compounds, and amides 2 and 3 were relative
more stable (t1/2 = 25-30 min in human liver microsomes) and compound 4 was indeed devoid of metabolic turnover in both rat and
human liver microsomes (t1/2 >90 min). coincubation of ketoconazole (a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor) abolished the oxidation of lm4108 and compounds 2 and 3; quinidine (a cyp2d6 inhibitor) only
partially inhibited the metabolism of three indomethacin amide
derivatives. only recombinant cyp2c9, but not cyp3a4 and 2d6
catalyzed the o-demethylation of compound 4. after oral administration of lm-4108 to rats, its plasma concentrations were below
the limit of detection (5.0 ng/ml); but the oral bioavailability of
compounds 2, 3 and 4 in rats were 20, 38.5 and 37.6%, respectively
[786]. after i.v. administration to rats, the clearance of lm-4108
was 155 ml/min/kg which exceeded rat hepatic blood flow (70
ml/min/kg), while the clearance for compounds 2, 3 and 4 was 26,
39.2 and 31 ml/min/kg only, respectively. these results indicate the
usefulness of metasite which has correctly predicted the metabolic
shift from oxidation on the amide substituent to o-demethylation
for these indomethacin derivatives with improved metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties.
4.2.27.7. naproxen
naproxen is a common nsaid of the arylalkanoic acid class
that has been approved for over-the-counter use since 1991 and is
utilized for its short-term analgesic effects as well as in the treatment of certain types of arthritis, dysmennhorea and migraine attacks. naproxen is eliminated following biotransformation to glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites which are excreted in urine (6692%), with only a small amount of the drug being eliminated unchanged [788]. the major phase i metabolite of naproxen is 6-odesmethyl product. like  xxxd2423xxx , a large fraction of a naproxen

dose (60%) is recovered as the products of direct glucuronidation
[789, 790]. the o-desmethyl metabolite accounted for an additional
20% of the dose recovered in urine. in vitro reaction phenotyping
data indicate that naproxen o-demethylation is mainly catalyzed by
cyp2c9 (50%) in human liver microsomes, with contributions
from  xxxg586xxx  and 1a2 (fig. (92)) [58, 737, 738]. both naproxen
and its o-desmethyl metabolite were glucuronidated to corresponding glucuronides [789]. naproxen was conjugated by ugt1a1,
1a9, 2b4 and 2b7 [731], while o-desmethylnaproxen was sulfated
by  xxxg2228xxx  ( xxxg2228xxx ), 1b1 and 1e1 [791]. naproxen
and o-desmethylnaproxen glucuronides constituted approximately
85% while sulfoconjugates constitute approximately 11% of the
dose excreted [792].
4.2.27.8. oxicams
the oxicams, including  xxxd2508xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx , and
 xxxd3311xxx , are extensively hydroxylated by cyp2c9 (fig. (93))
[98, 739, 741, 744-746, 793]. the oxicams of nsaid decrease
prostaglandin synthesis via inhibiting coxs, exhibiting analgesic,
antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects.  xxxd2508xxx  is eliminated predominantly by hepatic biotransformation and its major
metabolite is the pharmacologically inactive 5’-hydroxylornoxicam,
accounting for up to 95% of total intrinsic  xxxd2508xxx  clearance in
vitro (fig. (93)) [744]. analysis of the urine (40% of the dose)
reveals that 5’-hydroxy  xxxd2508xxx  is a major metabolite.  xxxd2508xxx  5’-hydroxylation by the liver microsomes from the cyp2c9*3
carriers was markedly reduced compared with those from the wildtype [745, 794]. in a bioequivalence study, one chinese subject had
an auc of  xxxd2508xxx  almost 40-fold higher than those found in
wild-type volunteers. this volunteer had one cyp2c9*3 allele together with cyp2c9*13 (269t>c) that presumably caused poor
metabolism of  xxxd2508xxx . in this subject, the half-life of  xxxd3394xxx  was 9 to 15 times longer than expected, suggesting the presence of two alleles that greatly reduce cyp2c9 activity [746, 795,
796].

(90). metabolism of indomethacin phenethylamide (lm-4108) by cyp3a4, 2d6, 2c9, and 2c19. in rat, mouse, and human liver microsomes, the primary
site of oxidation was on the methylene carbons of the phenethyl side chain to form the 1’- and 2’-hydroxy and 2’-oxo metabolites. cyp3a4 catalyzed side chain
oxidation to form 1’-oh-, 2’-oh and 2’-oxo derivatives, while o-demethylation was a minor oxidative pathway in contrast to the metabolism of indomethacin
and was catalyzed by cyp2d6 to form o-desmethyl metabolite with minor contributions from cyp2c9 and 2c19. cyp2c19 also showed a low activity for
2’-hydroxylation of lm-4108 and o-demethylation of 2’-oh-lm-4108. the glucuronides of 2’-hydroxy-lm-4108 and o-desmethyl-2’-hydroxy-lm-4108
were also observed in the bile of rats.

5'-hydroxytenoxicam

fig. (93). metabolism of  xxxd2508xxx .  xxxd2508xxx  is eliminated predominantly by hepatic biotransformation and its major metabolite is the pharmacologically
inactive 5’-hydroxylornoxicam, which accounted for up to 95% of total intrinsic  xxxd2508xxx  clearance.  xxxd2508xxx  can be used as a probe substrate for
cyp2c9 in vitro and in vivo.

biprofen, celecoxib,  xxxd2508xxx ,  xxxd3311xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , and  xxxd2969xxx  which are substantially metabolized by cyp2c9 [797].
however, even when cyp2c9 is a major determinant of drug clearance, it is necessary to consider  xxxg586xxx  genotype (e.g., ibuprofen)
and, possibly, cyp3a4 activity (e.g., celecoxib and  xxxd2561xxx ) as
well.
4.2.27.9.  xxxd3265xxx 
 xxxd3265xxx  (-methyl-4-(2-thienylcarbonyl)benzeneacetic acid) is
an nsaid of the 2-arylpropionic acid class that includes ibuprofen

and naproxen [798, 799]. in addition to phase ii glucuronidation of
the carboxylic acid group like other nsaids such as naproxen,
ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx , and diclofenac, formation of 5-hydroxysuprofen also constituted a major pathway of  xxxd3265xxx  clearance in
humans (fig. (94)) [800].  xxxd3265xxx  is metabolized by cyp2c9 [52]
and can inactivate this enzyme in a mechanism-based manner [801,
802]. the bioactivating steps for  xxxd3265xxx  by cyp2c9 is unclear,
but it has been suggested that 2c9-catalyzed oxidation of the thiophene ring would afford the reactive thiophene-4,5-epoxide, nucleophilic ring, opening of which by an active site residue would

(94). metabolism of  xxxd3265xxx . in addition to glucuronidation of the carboxylic acid group, formation of 5-hydroxysuprofen also constituted a major pathway of  xxxd3265xxx  clearance in humans.  xxxd3265xxx  is metabolized by cyp2c9 and can inactivate this enzyme in a mechanism-based manner. the bioactivating
mechanism for  xxxd3265xxx  by cyp2c9 is unclear, but it has been suggested that cyp2c9-catalyzed oxidation of the thiophene ring would afford the reactive
thiophene-4,5-epoxide, nucleophilic ring, opening of which by an active site residue would produce a protein adduct. alternately, addition of glutathione
across the epoxide followed by dehydration would result in the regio-isomeric thioethers, respectively. the thiophene epoxidation pathway is likely since it
also accounts for 5-hydroxytienilic acid formation that could result via an intermediate

produce a protein adduct [802]. alternately, addition of glutathione
across the epoxide followed by dehydration would result in the
regio-isomeric thioethers, respectively. the thiophene epoxidation
pathway is likely since it also accounts for 5-hydroxytienilic acid
formation that could result via an intermediate [802]. the resultant
-thioketo-,-unsaturated aldehyde may serve as the electrophilic
intermediate derived from the bioactivation of  xxxd3265xxx  that covalently binds to cyp2c9, in addition to or as an alternative to the
reactive thiophene epoxide metabolite.
4.2.27.10. zaltoprofen
zaltoprofen, a nsaid of  xxxd3029xxx  class, is used in the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis as well as to
relieve inflammation and pain after surgery, injury and tooth extraction [803, 804]. following oral administration of zaltoprofen to
healthy subjects, 62% of the dose was excreted as conjugates in the
urine, with 3% being excreted as unchanged drug [805]. in addition
to conjugation, zaltoprofen was converted to zaltoprofen s-oxide
(m2), 10-hydroxyzaltoprofen (m3) and 10-hydroxyzaltoprofen soxide (m5) (fig. (95)) [805]. the conjugates of m2 and m3 were
excreted into the urine, with each of these metabolites accounting
for <10% of the dose. in vitro, cyp2c9 catalysed sulphoxidation to
form m2 but not hydroxylation of zaltoprofen, with minor contribu-

tion from cyp3a4 and 1a1 [806]. in addition, zaltoprofen was
conjugated by ugt2b7 [805].
4.2.27.11. mtppa (r,s-2-[4-(3-methyl-2-thienyl)phenyl] propionic
acid)
mtppa is a novel, orally effective nsaid of the 2arylpropionic acid class [807]. the s-isomer is pharmacologically
active, whereas the r-isomer is inactive. s-mtppa was well absorbed with a bioavailability of 97.7% in rats [808]. the drug was
metabolized mainly by oxidation of the thiophenyl moiety and by
glucuronidation of the carboxyl group in rats and monkeys, while
the major urinary and fecal metabolite was the taurine conjugate in
dogs [808-810]. r- and s-mtppa are probably each converted to
the thioester, r- and s-mtppa-coa, which are then interinverted
by epimerase as for ibuprofen-coa followed by hydrolysis to r- or
s-mtppa or by conjugation with taurine to yield taurine conjugate
[809]. r-mtppa was chirally inverted to s-mtppa in rats and
dogs, although the extent of chiral inversion was greater in dogs
than in rats [809]. in human liver microsomes, s-mtppa was
mainly oxidized to the 5-hydroxylated metabolite of the thiophene
ring (ma6) (fig. (96)) [811]. when incubated with recombinant
cyps, s-mtppa was substantially oxidized to ma6 exclusively by
cyp2c9. these results indicate that the formation of ma6 from smtppa is catalysed predominantly by cyp2c9.

carboxy celecoxib

fig. (97). metabolism of celecoxib. methyl hydroxylation is a major metabolic pathway for celecoxib in human liver microsomes, and that the reaction is catalyzed largely (70-90%) by cyp2c9, with contribution from cyp3a4 (<25%). methyl hydroxy celecoxib is oxidized further to the corresponding carboxylic
acid metabolite via cytosolic  xxxg110xxx , and up to 86% of the dose is recovered as methyl hydroxy celecoxib and carboxy celecoxib. carboxy
celecoxib is conjugated by unidentified ugts to glucuronides which are excreted into the bile.

4.2.28. selective  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors
cox is a hemeprotein that has been shown to convert  xxxd208xxx  to proinflammatory prostaglandins and their subsequent
metabolic products [812]. cox behaves as an endoperoxide synthetase, catalyzing the formation of the cyclic endoperoxide prostaglandin g2 from the unesterified precursor fatty acid, and as a peroxidase that converts prostaglandin g2 to prostaglandin h2. prostaglandin h2 is then converted to other products (e.g., prostaglandin i2
and thromboxane a2) via the action of prostacyclin synthetase and
thromboxane synthetase [812]. because the products of cox-1 are
cytoprotective, selective inhibition of cox-2 can reduce inflammation with less of the gastrointestinal side effects characteristic of
non-selective nsaids [783]. cyp2c9 plays a major role in the
metabolism of several selective cox-2 inhibitors. these include
celecoxib [813, 814],  xxxd2069xxx  [815],  xxxd2517xxx  [816], rofecoxib
[817], and  xxxd3481xxx  [818].  xxxd2849xxx  is an injectable prodrug of
 xxxd3481xxx , used for short term perioperative pain control [819821].
4.2.28.1. celecoxib
celecoxib is the first selective cox-2 inhibitor developed for
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [822]. celecoxib is well absorbed and is extensively metabolized in humans,
with less than 3% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine and feces. methyl hydroxylation is a major metabolic pathway for celecoxib in human liver microsomes, and that the reaction is catalyzed
largely (70-90%) by cyp2c9, with lesser contribution from
cyp3a4 (<25%) (fig. (97)) [813, 814]. methyl hydroxy celecoxib
is oxidized further to the corresponding carboxylic acid metabolite
via cytosolic  xxxg110xxx , and up to 86% of the dose is
recovered as methyl hydroxy celecoxib and carboxy celecoxib

[823]. carboxycelecoxib is subject to glucuronidation followed by
bile excretion. the rate of celecoxib hydroxylation was decreased
by 50% in livers genotyped cyp2c9*1/*3 compared to
cyp2c9*1/*1 [813]. in contrast, celecoxib hydroxylation was impacted minimally in livers genotyped cyp2c9*1/*2. a single-dose
study found that the highest auc values of celecoxib (2 times the
mean auc of all participants) were observed in three carriers of
cyp2c9*3 alleles [824]. similar results were observed in a steadystate pharmacokinetic study following twice daily doses of celecoxib (200 mg) for 15 days [825]. stempak et al. (2005) [826] reported that the auc of a single celecoxib dose (250 mg/m2) was
10-fold higher in a pediatric patient genotyped cyp2c9*3/*3
compared to two cyp2c9*1/*1 patients. the auc of single-dose
celecoxib is increased 2.3-fold by coadministered fluconazole, but
not ketoconazole [822].
celecoxib was docked into the active site of cyp2c9 using the
available crystal structure 1r9o, without crystallographic water
molecules [827]. only one docking solution had the carbon atom in
the methyl group within 3 å from the ferryl oxygen and metasite
predicted that the methyl group in celecoxib was most likely to be
metabolized by cyp2c9, which has been confirmed by in vitro
metabolism studies [813, 814]. the carbon atom in the methyl
group was docked 2.9 å from the ferryl oxygen which is a productive mode. amino acids within 3 å from the trifluoromethyl group
included leu208, phe476, and phe100. the docking of celecoxib in
cyp2c9 indicated an interaction between the sulfonamide group
and arg108.
ahlstrom et al. (2007) [827, 828] investigated the enzyme inhibition and cyp2c9-mediated metabolism using 13 newly synthesized celecoxib analogues (fig. (98)). the sulfonamide group of

tabolically [827]. analog 3 was a cyp2c9 substrate, but the phenyl
group decreased the extent of metabolism at 30 min to only 49%
compared to 94% for celecoxib. analog 13 was metabolized, with
lower extent than celecoxib, indicating that if additional hydrogen
bonds were formed, they did not enhance the positioning of the
methyl relative to the heme moiety in a productive manner. analog
10 showed a 70% decrease in metabolism, suggesting the importance of the interactions between the sulfonamide moiety and
cyp2c9. analogs 4 and 6 showed comparable metabolism as celecoxib while analog 5 had a modest decrease (to 48%). compounds
with a carboxylic acid group in the sulfonamide group (1, 2, 11, and
12) exhibited a clear decrease in the metabolism [827, 828]. the
ethoxycarbonyl analog 8 underwent cyp2c9-catalyzed oxidation
to the same extent as celecoxib, while the corresponding ethoxycarbonyl analog 7 that also bears a trifluoromethyl group in the ch3 ,
instead was a very poor substrate. combining the structural information gained from the docking studies with metasite predictions
is a useful approach to design pharmacologically active cox-2
inhibitors with improved metabolic properties.

celecoxib was replaced with a methyl group to give compound 10;
other structural changes were also conducted in this position. three
compounds, the sulfide (4), the sulfoxide (5), and the sulfone (6),
representing different oxidation states on the sulfur atom, were
synthesized [828]. this series of compounds was used to evaluate
the influence of the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the
oxygens and arg108 in cyp2c9 [827]. in compound 2, a carboxyl
group has replaced the sulfonamide group; compound 8 is the corresponding ethyl ester. these two compounds provided another
opportunity to evaluate the impact of potential hydrogen-bond interactions in the active site of cyp2c9. for comparison, the corresponding two analogs with a trifluoromethyl group in the methyl
group were also studied. the resulting analogs are compound 1,
with a carboxyl group in the sulfonamide group, and compound 7,
with an ethoxycarbonyl group in the sulfonamide group. a further
investigation of the effects of a carboxyl group in the sulfonamide
group was performed with compounds 11 and 12. these two compounds have an additional methylene unit between the aromatic
ring and the carboxyl group. when incubated with recombinant
cyp2c9 for 30 min, the trifluoromethyl analog 9 was stable me-

(99). metabolism of  xxxd2069xxx .  xxxd2069xxx  is mainly metabolized via 6’-methyl hydroxylation and 1’-n-oxidation by multiple cyps, resulting in 1’-n’oxide, 6’-hydroxymethyl, and 6’-carboxy metabolites. these metabolites, which do not inhibit cox-1, are largely formed by cyp3a4, whereas cyp2c9, 2d6,
1a2, and possibly 2c19 played a lesser important role.

4.2.28.2.  xxxd2069xxx 
 xxxd2069xxx  is the first selective cox-2 inhibitor used for the
treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, dysmenorrhea, and
gouty arthritis [829]. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2069xxx  is linear at
clinically relevant doses (5-120 mg/day) and its half-life is about 22
hr [830]. although  xxxd2069xxx  is a low clearance compound
(0.8 ml/min/kg), with high oral bioavailability (>80%), it has been
shown to undergo extensive biotransformation (>90% of the dose)
to metabolites that are detected in urine and feces [831]. in addition,
in vitro studies have indicated that  xxxd2069xxx  is mainly metabolized
via 6’-methyl hydroxylation and 1’-n-oxidation by multiple cyps
(fig. (99)) [832], resulting in 1’-n’-oxide, 6’-hydroxymethyl, and
6’-carboxy metabolites. the 6’-methylhydroxy metabolite is major
in human liver microsomes and is oxidized further to 6'-carboxy
 xxxd2069xxx . these metabolites, which do not inhibit cox-1, are
largely formed by cyp3a4 (60%), whereas cyp2c9 (<20%),
2d6, 1a2, and possibly 2c19 played a lesser important role [815,
832]. about 75% of the dose is cleared via cyp-dependent 6’methyl hydroxylation [831].
4.2.28.3.  xxxd2517xxx 
 xxxd2517xxx  is a selective cox-2 inhibitor, which has been
developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
and acute pain [833, 834].  xxxd2517xxx  is chemically distinct from
other cox-2 inhibitors in that it has a carboxylic acid group that
confers weakly acidity (pka = 4.7).  xxxd2517xxx  has demonstrated
dose-proportional and time-independent pharmacokinetics in singleand multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects and patients with osteoarthritis, at doses up to 800 mg once daily [835]. the majority of
urinary excretion (85%) occurred during the first 24 hr postdose,
with only a small percentage of the dose (3.3%) being excreted as
unchanged drug in urine.  xxxd2517xxx  and its metabolites are excreted via renal (54.1%) and faecal (42.7%) routes in approximately
equal amounts [836]. the major metabolic pathways identified
involve oxidation of the 5-methyl group and/or hydroxylation of its
dihaloaromatic ring [836]. major metabolites of  xxxd2517xxx  in
plasma are the 5-carboxy (m11), 4’-hydroxy (m23) and 4’hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives (m5), of which only the 4’-hydroxy
derivative is active and cox-2 selective (fig. (100)). there are at

least two minor metabolites (m8 and m15) identified in human
plasma. in urine, at least 20 metabolites were identified, with most
accounting for <2% of the dose. metabolites m5 and m11 were the
most prominent, representing 7.8% and 6.3% of the dose, respectively. metabolite profiles in feces were less complex than in urine,
although m5 and m11 were the major components, accounting for
20.5% and 8.3% of the dose, respectively [836]. further phase ii
conjugation of metabolites (and to a minor extent,  xxxd2517xxx ) was
observed. cyclization to the corresponding lactam occurred with
several metabolites, whereas direct acyl glucuronidation of  xxxd2517xxx  was a relatively minor metabolic pathway, accounting for
approximately 2.5% of the dose.  xxxd2517xxx  is extensively metabolized by cyp2c9, with minor contribution from cyp1a2 and
2c19 in vitro [816]. in vivo,  xxxd2517xxx  showed no significant
pharmacokinetic interaction with r- or  xxxd990xxx , and methotrexate [837]. fluconazole, a potent cyp2c9 inhibitor, had no clinically
significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2517xxx  [836]. in
patients genotyped as poor cyp2c9 metabolizers, the auc of
 xxxd2517xxx  was not significantly increased compared with control
subjects, indicating no requirement for adjustment of  xxxd2517xxx 
dose in these subjects.
4.2.28.4. rofecoxib
rofecoxib (vioxx) is a selective cox-2 inhibitor [838] used
for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and pain, but
was voluntarily withdrawn from clinical use in september 2004
because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke
associated with long-term, high-dosage use [839]. such increased
risk was not found in other cox-2 inhibitors including celecoxib,
 xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx . rofecoxib is extensively metabolized
via complex oxidative, reductive, and back-reduction pathways
(fig. (101)) [817]. although the metabolic pathways of rofecoxib
are similar between the rat and human, oxidation to 5hydroxyrofecoxib predominated in rats [840], whereas reduction of
rofecoxib to the corresponding isomeric 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid
derivatives is the major pathway in humans [841]. furthermore, 5hydroxyrofecoxib, the primary oxidative metabolite, was found to
undergo reversible metabolism to rofecoxib [841]. 4’-hydroxyrofecoxib-o--glucuronide, diastereomeric 5-hydroxyrofecoxib-o-glucuronide conjugates have been detected in human urine [841].

corresponding lactam occurred with several metabolites, whereas direct acyl glucuronidation of  xxxd2517xxx  was a relatively minor metabolic pathway, accounting for approximately 2.5% of the dose.  xxxd2517xxx  is extensively metabolized by cyp2c9, with minor contribution from cyp1a2 and 2c19 in vitro.

in human liver microsomal incubations, rofecoxib has been found to
be metabolized to 5-hydroxyrofecoxib by several cyps, with
cyp3a4 (60%) and 1a2 (30%) showing the greatest activities
[817]. cyp2c9, 2c19, 2d6 and  xxxd851xxx  also showed some activity for
this reaction. in liver s9 fractions, the metabolite profile of rofecoxib has been more complex, including the formation of 5hydroxyrofecoxib and 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid derivatives (i.e.
rofecoxib- xxxd2033xxx -3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid and rofecoxib-threo3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid); the latter are considered to represent the
major pathways in vivo [841]. thus, it has been suggested that
cyps play a minor role in rofecoxib’s overall metabolism (<10%).
the plasma concentrations of rofecoxib correlated to the plasma
caffeine-paraxanthine ratio in vivo, suggesting a role for cyp1a2 in
the metabolism of rofecoxib [842].
4.2.28.5.  xxxd3481xxx 
 xxxd3481xxx  is a cox-2 inhibitor used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and painful menstruation and menstrual symptoms [843, 844]. compared with celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx 
possesses even greater potency and high specificity for cox-2 inhibition. in april 2005, pfizer withdrew  xxxd3481xxx  from the u.s.

market on recommendation by the fda, citing an increased risk of
heart attack and stroke and also the risk of a serious, sometimes
fatal, skin reaction [845, 846]. following a single 50-mg oral dose
of 14c- xxxd3481xxx , only a small fraction (4%) is recovered as unchanged drug [847]. about 20% of the recovered dose represents
the n-glucuronide of parent compound. the products of nhydroxylation, methyl hydroxylation and benzyl hydroxylation, and
their secondary metabolites, accounted for (75%) of the dose.
 xxxd3481xxx  was extensively metabolized in human, and nine phase
i metabolites were identified [847]. the major oxidative routes of
 xxxd3481xxx  included hydroxylation at either the 5-methyl group to
form m1 or n-hydroxylation at the sulfonamide moiety to form m2
(fig. (102)). further oxidation of m1 resulted in several other phase
i metabolites (m3, m4, m5 and m6). hydroxylation at the meta
position of the 3-phenyl group of  xxxd3481xxx  formed m9 which was
conjugated by glucuronic acid. the further oxidation of m1 formed
m4, a carboxylic acid metabolite and m6, an isoxazole ring opened
metabolite. m1 or m9 could be further hydroxylated to form the
same di-hydroxylated metabolite, m3, in which hydroxylation occurred at both the meta position of the 3-phenyl group and the 5methyl group of  xxxd3481xxx . hydroxylation either at the 5-methyl

metabolic pathway of rofecoxib is similar between the rat and human, oxidation to 5-hydroxyrofecoxib predominated in rats, whereas reduction of rofecoxib to
the corresponding isomeric 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid derivatives is the major pathway in humans. furthermore, 5-hydroxyrofecoxib was found to undergo reversible metabolism to rofecoxib. 4’-hydroxyrofecoxib-o--glucuronide, diastereomeric 5-hydroxyrofecoxib-o--glucuronide conjugates have been detected
in human urine. in human liver microsomal incubations, rofecoxib has been found to be metabolized to 5-hydroxyrofecoxib by several cyps, with cyp1a2
and 3a4 showing the greatest activities. cyp2c9, 2c19, 2d6 and  xxxd851xxx  also showed some activity. in liver s9 fractions, the metabolite profile of rofecoxib has

group of m2 or at the sulfonamide function group of m1 led to the
formation of the same metabolite, m5. oxidative breakdown of the
n-hydroxy sulfonamide function group in m2 led to the formation
of corresponding sulfinic acid metabolite (m7) which was further
oxidized to m8, a sulfonic acid metabolite. the o-glucuronide of
m1 and n-glucuronide of  xxxd3481xxx  were the major urinary metabolites accounting for 23.3 and 19.5% of the total dose, respectively [847]. the other urinary conjugated metabolites were glucuronides of m2, m3, m5, and m9. both m7 and m8 were also detected in human urine in trace amounts. both cyp2c9 and
cyp3a4 metabolize  xxxd3481xxx  in vitro [818]. fluconazole and
ketoconazole increase the auc of  xxxd3481xxx  62% and 38%, respectively [818].
4.2.29. opioids and opioid receptor antagonists
opioids are extensively metabolized in the liver, subject to odealkylation, n-dealkylation, ketoreduction, or deacetylation leading to phase i metabolites [848]. via glucuronidation or sulfatation,
conjugated are formed. some metabolites of opioids have an activity themselves and contribute to the effects of the parent drug.

4.2.29.1. buprenorphine
buprenorphine is a synthetic derivative of the morphine alkaloid thebaine with partial agonist properties on the -opioid receptor [849-852]. buprenorphine has been used as an analgesic for the
treatment of moderate to severe pain by intramuscular, intravenous,
and sublingual routes. it is metabolized by n-dealkylation of its
cyclopropyl group to form norbuprenorphine, an active metabolite
[853], and both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine undergo subsequent glucuronidation (fig. (103)) [854]. cyp3a4 was the major
enzyme involved in norbuprenorphine formation, but about 25% of
norbuprenorphine formation could not be attributed to cyp3a4
[855, 856]. moody et al. (2002) [857] have revealed that
norbuprenorphine formation was mainly catalyzed by  xxxg586xxx ,
3a4, 3a5 and 3a7. picard et al. (2005) [858] have found that
cyp3a4 accounts for about 65% of norbuprenorphine production
and  xxxg586xxx  for about 30%. in addition, buprenorphine undergoes
another oxidative metabolic pathway, which was catalyzed by
cyp2c9, 2c18, 2c19, and 3a. incubation of buprenorphine or
norbuprenorphine with human liver microsomes led to the forma tion

moiety to form m2. further oxidation of m1 resulted in several other phase i metabolites (m3, m4, m5 and m6). hydroxylation at the meta
position of the 3-phenyl group of  xxxd3481xxx  formed m9 which was conjugated by glucuronic acid. the further oxidation of m1 formed m4, a
carboxylic acid metabolite and m6, an isoxazole ring opened metabolite. m1 or m9 could be further hydroxylated to form the same dihydroxylated metabolite, m3, in which hydroxylation occurred at both the meta position of the 3-phenyl group and the 5-methyl group of
 xxxd3481xxx . hydroxylation either at the 5-methyl group of m2 or at the sulfonamide function group of m1 led to the formation of the same

hydromorphone is a semisynthetic :-opioid analogue prepared
by electrolytic reduction of morphine or by oxidation of  xxxd1888xxx . it is used for the relief of moderate to severe pain and is
a useful alternative to morphine where patients are not responsive
to this drug or when the adverse effects of morphine, such as nausea
and sedation, are severe [859-861]. the  opioid receptor binding

ugts and sults.
4.2.29.3.  xxxd2421xxx 
 xxxd2421xxx  is a potent opioid analgesic with some n-methyl
d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonizing activity [865, 866]. it is
structurally related to pethidine, another opioid analog.  xxxd2421xxx  is used for all types of severe pain due to postoperative, cancer, kidney stones and fracture. the major metabolic pathways of
 xxxd2421xxx  in humans include n-demethylation, ring-hydroxylation and conjugation of the phenolic hydroxyl group (fig. (105))
[867-869]. bondesson et al. [867] identified three metabolites including norketobemidone, dihydroxyketobemidone (4’-hydroxyketobemidone) and para-hydroxymethoxyketobemidone from human urine. in addition to these three metabolites, sundstrom et al.
(2001) [869] identified two new metabolites: meta-hydroxymethoxyketobemidone and  xxxd2421xxx  n-oxide in patient urine.
both  xxxd2421xxx  and norketobemidone are glucuronidated and
the resultant glucuronides are excreted into the urine. a total recovery of 80% of the dose was found in urine as  xxxd2421xxx  and
metabolites after oral and i.v administration, with conjugated metabolites accounting for 34-68% of the dose. after oral or i.v administration, the recovery of unchanged  xxxd2421xxx  in urine was
3-10% and 13-24%, respectively [867]. norketobemidone formed
by n-demethylation constituted 10-37% of the dose, and 4’hydroxyketobemidone amounted to 3-12% of the dose. less than
2% of the dose was found in feces after i.v administration.  xxxd2421xxx  n-demethylation is mainly catalyzed by cyp2c9 and 3a4
to form norketobemidone [870]. the formation rate of norketobemidone was three times higher in the cyp2c9*1*1 genotype group
compared with the cyp2c9*1*2, cyp2c9*1*3 and cyp2c9*3*3
genotypes [870]. thus, the cyp2c9 genotype may affect the disposition and analgesic effect of  xxxd2421xxx .

4.2.29.4. methadone
methadone is partially metabolized by cyp2c9, although
 xxxg583xxx , 2c19 and 3a4 may play a more important role in its metabolism [871, 872]. methadone is extensively metabolized by ndemethylation by cyp3a4, 2b6, 2c8, 2c19 and 2d6 to 2ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrolidine
(eddp)
(fig.
(106)) [871-876]. in healthy volunteers, paroxetine (a potent
cyp2d6 inhibitor [877]) significantly increases the plasma concentrations of r- and s-methadone [878, 879]. in addition, in two poor
metabolizers of cyp2d6, only s-methadone but not r-methadone
was increased by paroxetine [878]. fluoxetine, another potent inhibitor of cyp2d6, stereo-selectively increased the concentration
of r- but not s-methadone [880]. however, fluvoxamine nonselectively increased the plasma levels of both r- and s-methadone
[880]. fluconazole increased plasma methadone peak and trough
concentrations in healthy volunteers by 27 and 48%, respectively
[881]. all these findings suggest that cyp2d6 plays an important
role in the metabolism of methadone which will be affected by the
genotype of cyp2d6, and that they may have different stereoselectivity.
4.2.30. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar- )
agonists: thiazolidinediones
thiazolidinediones are synthetic ppar- agonists that decrease
insulin resistance and may have direct beneficial effects on pancreatic -cells [882-885]. rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are extensively metabolized by  xxxg586xxx , and to lesser extent by cyp2c9
(rosiglitazone) and cyp3a4 (pioglitazone) [21, 22].
4.2.30.1. pioglitazone
pioglitazone is metabolized by hepatic  xxxg586xxx , 2c9 and 3a4
to at least four primary oxidative metabolites (designated m-i, m-ii,
m-iv and m-v) and two secondary metabolites (m-iii and m-vi)
(fig. (107)) [886-889]. in addition, a putative dihydroxy metabolite

fig. (106). metabolism of methadone. the clinically used methadone is a
mixture of r- and s-enantiomers in which the r-methadone is the major
pharmacologically active form. the affinity of r-methadone for - and opioid receptors and its analgesic activity are 10- and 50-fold higher, respectively, compared with those of s-enantiomer. in humans, methadone is
extensively metabolized, and one major metabolic pathway is ndemethylation by cyp3a4 (major), 2b6, 2c8, 2c19 and 2d6 to eddp. the
initial n-demethylation of methadone was accompanied by a spontaneous
cyclization between the secondary amine and the ketone to form eddp.
both eddp and emdp are pharmacologically inactive without opioid
activity. eddp can be converted to emdp by further n-demethylation. in
addition to eddp, six other metabolites of methadone have been identified,
accounting for 43 to 83% of a given dose of methadone in human urine.
about 75% of the urinary and fecal radioactive metabolites were unconjugated.

(m-xi) has been identified in human urine [890]. m-iv is further
metabolised to result in a secondary metabolite m-iii. the pharmacologically active m-iv and m-iii are the main metabolites found
in human serum and their circulating concentrations are equal to or
greater than those of the parent pioglitazone [887]. the lipidho

lowering fibrate gemfibrozil, an inhibitor of  xxxg586xxx  [891, 892],
has increased the auc of pioglitazone 3.2 times in human volunteers [893]. in contrast, the antimycotic agent itraconazole, a potent
inhibitor of cyp3a4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of
pioglitazone. these findings suggest that pioglitazone is mainly
metabolised by  xxxg586xxx  in vivo. in rats, at least eight oxidative and
conjugated metabolites have been identified [894, 895]. metabolites
resulting from hydroxylation of either carbon adjacent to the pyridine ring were conjugated with glucuronic acid (m7) or sulfuric
acid (m6). the metabolite hydroxylated on the terminal carbon of
the ethyl side chain was further oxidized to the carboxylic acid derivative (m3). oxidative loss of the terminal carbon led to a  xxxd2715xxx  derivative (m2) and loss of both carbon atoms to the corresponding 3-hydroxypyridine (m9) derivative that was excreted as
the sulfate conjugate (m8). the two carboxylic acid metabolites
were also conjugated with taurine (m4 and m5). moreover, like
troglitazone and rosiglitazone, pioglitazone is converted to ringopened product(s) of the thiazolidinedione ring, which may be associated with its liver toxicity [896].
4.2.30.2. rosiglitazone
rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione class used
as an oral antidiabetic agent that exerts its hypoglycemic effect by
binding to ppar- [897]. rosiglitazone contains a thiazolidinedione core, but differs from other thiazolidinediones in the presence
of an aminopyridyl side chain. such substitutions among side
chains are believed to be responsible for differences in metabolism
and antidiabetic efficacy among thiazolidinediones. rosiglitazone is
extensively metabolized to a number of oxidative and conjugated
metabolites [898]. the major metabolic routes of rosiglitazone in
humans are n-demethylation, hydroxylation, and subsequent conjugation, and these are not affected by the route of dose administration (fig. (108)). approximately 44% of the metabolites are ndemethylated, and about 76% are hydroxylated on the pyridinyl
ring, with or without n-demethylation [898]. the ratio of ortho- to
para-hydroxylation was approximately 1 to 9. the hydroxylated
products are extensively conjugated, accounting for about two-

(108). metabolism of rosiglitazone. rosiglitazone is extensively metabolized to a number of oxidative and conjugated metabolites. the major metabolic
routes of rosiglitazone in humans are n-demethylation, hydroxylation, and subsequent conjugation, and these are not affected by the route of dose administration. approximately 44% of the metabolites are n-demethylated, and about 76% are hydroxylated on the pyridinyl ring, with or without n-demethylation. the
ratio of ortho- to para-hydroxylation was approximately 1 to 9. the hydroxylated products are extensively conjugated, accounting for about two-thirds of the
total metabolites, with the ratio of sulfation to glucuronidation being approximately 6 to 1. the major metabolic products following incubation of rosiglitazone
with human liver microsomes are para-hydroxy and n-desmethyl rosiglitazone. both hydroxylation and n-demethylation are catalyzed by  xxxg586xxx , with
minor contribution from cyp2c9.

are para-hydroxy and n-desmethyl rosiglitazone. both hydroxylation and n-demethylation are catalyzed by  xxxg586xxx , with minor
contribution from cyp2c9 [21]. n-desmethylrosiglitazone (m12,
sb-237216) and unconjugated para-hydroxyrosiglitazone (m13,
sb-275286) are 20-fold less potent than and equipotent with
rosiglitazone, respectively [899].
4.2.31. phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitors
sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil (for chemical structures, see
fig. (109)) are cgmp-specific pde5 (ec3.1.4.17) inhibitors currently used for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction [900-904].
pde5 is responsible for degradation of cgmp in the corpus cavernosum in the penis. sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil show different metabolic and pharmacokinetic profiles [905]. the duration of
action of sildenafil and vardenafil is of about 4 hr, whereas that of
tadalafil is of about 36 hr [903]. sildenafil n-demethylation, ude-

nafil n-dealkylation, and vardenafil n-deethylation are catalyzed by
cyp3a4 and 3a5 [906]. tadalafil is a mechanism-based inhibitor
of cyp3a4 in vitro, but administration of tadalafil for 14 days does
not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and lovastatin in
human volunteers [907]. cyp2c9 only plays a minor or negligible
role in the metabolism of pde5 inhibitors.
4.2.31.1. sildenafil
sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of pde5 and is the
first pde5 inhibitor on the market [908]. it is rapidly absorbed after
oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of about 40%. its
pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional over the recommended dose
range [909, 910]. after either oral or intravenous administration,
sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces
(approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine. sildenafil is eliminated predominantly by hepatic
metabolism and is converted by n-demethylation to an active metabolite uk-103,320 with properties similar to the parent drug (fig.
(110)). sildenafil is converted to its major circulating metabolite,

n-desmethyl sildenafil
(uk-103,320)

fig. (110). metabolism of sildenafil by cyp3a4, 2c9, 2c19 and 2d6. sildenafil is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism and is converted to an
active metabolite uk-103,320 via n-demethylation with properties similar to the parent, sildenafil. sildenafil is converted to its major circulating metabolite,
uk-103,320, by cyp3a4, with contribution from cyp2c9, 2c19 and 2d6.

uk-103,320, by cyp3a4, with contribution from cyp2c9, 2c19
and 2d6 [906, 911]. the metabolite uk-103,320 has a pde selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an in vitro potency for pde5
approximately 50% of the parent drug. plasma concentrations of
this metabolite are approximately 40% of those seen for sildenafil,
thus the metabolite accounts for about 20% of sildenafil’s pharmacologic effects. cimetidine (a nonspecific cyp inhibitor) caused a
56% increase in plasma sildenafil concentrations when coadministered with sildenafil to healthy volunteers [912]. in a study of
healthy male volunteers, co-administration of sildenafil at steady
state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx  (a
moderate inducer of cyp3a4, 2c9 and possibly of 2c19) at steady
state resulted in a 63% decrease of the auc and a 55% decrease in
the cmax of sildenafil [913, 914]. the auc of the active metabolite,
n-desmethyl sildenafil, was increased 62% by loop and potassiumsparing diuretics and 102% by non-specific -blockers. however,
 xxxd3394xxx  or warfarin does not alter the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil. the genotype of cyp2c9 does not affect the clearance of
sildenafil in humans [915]. these findings indicate a minor role of
cyp2c9 in the overall elimination of sildenafil.
4.2.32.  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors (ppis)
ppis suppress gastric acid secretion via interaction with h+/k+atpase in gastric parietal cells [916, 917]. all ppis including omeprazole, pantoprazole,  xxxd2444xxx , esomeprazole, and  xxxd3070xxx 
(fig. (111)) have a common chiral benzimidazole sulfoxide struc-

ture; they have, however, been used as racemic mixtures of the stereo-isomers [918]. cyp2c19 is the primary contributor (>80%) to
the metabolism of ppis including omeprazole,  xxxd2444xxx , and
pantoprazole in humans, with minor contribution from cyp3a4
and 2c9 [104, 919-923]. in contrast,  xxxd3070xxx  is degraded to a
thioether product non-enzymatically [924], and thus  xxxd3070xxx 
may have significantly less drug interactions than other ppis [925].
4.2.32.1.  xxxd2444xxx 
 xxxd2444xxx  is the second generation  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor
used for the treatment of peptic ulcer, zollinger-ellison syndrome,
and other hypersecretory diseases [926]. enantiomer-selective
 xxxd2444xxx  disposition was influenced less significantly by
cyp2c19 genetic polymorphism than by omeprazole [927],
suggesting that cyp2c19-catalyzed metabolism is not the
predominant pathway determining the enantio-selective disposition
of  xxxd2444xxx . although the chemical structures of  xxxd2444xxx 
and omeprazole share a common pyridinyl sulfinyl benzimidazole
backbone with a sulfoxide chiral center, the catalytic sites of both
drugs have been reported to be different for cyp2c19-catalyzed
hydroxylation: the omeprazole hydroxylation site is on a pyridine
group, whereas that of  xxxd2444xxx  is on a benzimidazole group
[104]. for  xxxd2444xxx , its hydroxy metabolite was formed mainly
by cyp2c19 with lesser contribution from cyp3a4 and 2c9,
while sulfone formation was catalyzed only by cyp3a4 (fig.
(112)) [104, 919].

vivo, cyp2c19 is expected to have higher affinity to s-enantiomer compared with r-form, which may lead to greater elimination and thus lower plasma concentrations of s- xxxd2444xxx . enantiomer-selective  xxxd2444xxx  disposition was influenced less significantly by cyp2c19 genotype than by omeprazole.

4.2.32.2. omeprazole

4.2.33. sedative and anesthetic agents

omeprazole undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and the
major metabolites formed are 5'-o-desmethylomeprazole, 5- and 3hydroxyomeprazole, and omeprazole sulfone [928]. formation of
the sulfone metabolite and 3-oh-omeprazole is mediated by
cyp3a4, whereas 5-oh-omeprazole and 5’-o-desmethylomeprazole are mainly formed by cyp2c19 with some contribution
from cyp3a4 and 2c9 (fig. (113)). r-omeprazole is cleared efficiently via cyp2c19 with minor contribution from cyp3a4,
whereas the reverse cyp contribution was found for the s-isomer
but with relatively lower clearance [922].

4.2.33.1. ketamine
ketamine is an n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist used in clinical practice due to its anesthetic, sedative, and
analgesic properties [929, 930]. it is frequently used for induction of
anesthesia in short term surgical operations, in maintaining anesthesia with other anesthetic agents, and as a postoperative pain relief
agent in intensive care units [929]. ketamine is n-demethylated by
cyp enzymes in the liver into norketamine which is considered as
the major metabolite with some analgesic activity [931]. the ndemethylation of ketamine was catalyzed by cyp2c9, 3a4 and

(113). metabolism of omeprazole by cyp2c19, 3a4 and 2c9. cyp2c19 favors 5-hydroxylation of the pyridine group of r-omeprazole with 10-fold
greater intrinsic activity than toward s-omeprazole, whereas it catalyzes 5-o-demethylation of s-omeprazole in the benzimidazole group. cyp3a4 is mainly
responsible for the sulfone formation and cyp2c9 is involved in its 5-hydroxylation.

2b6 (fig. (114)) [932, 933]. inhibitors to cyp2c9 such as statins
increased the auc of ketamine. meanwhile, inducers to cyp3a4,
2c9, and 2b6 such as barbiturates and rifampicin could enhance
ketamine metabolism. in humans, patients with a history of chronic
barbiturate use were associated with decreased steady-state plasma
concentrations of ketamine [934]. in addition, ketamine was converted to 4-, 5- and 6-hydroxynorketamine and possibly 4- and 6hydroxyketamine in hepatic microsomal preparations from rats,
rabbits and humans, with 6-hydroxyketamine being the major metabolite [931].
4.2.33.2. propofol
propofol is a short-acting intravenous sedative agent used for
the induction of general anesthesia for adults and children, maintenance of general anesthesia, and sedation in medical contexts, such
as intensive care unit sedation for intubated, mechanically ventilated adults, and in procedures such as colonoscopy [935-937]. it is
a phenolic derivative that is structurally unrelated to other sedative
hypnotic agents. propofol is a highly lipophilic drug and is excreted
mainly as the glucuronide of parent drug and sulfate and glucuronide of the para-hydroxylated metabolite in the urine. the conjugation of the para-hydroxylated metabolite forms 4-(2,6-diisopropyl1,4- xxxd2299xxx )-sulphate, 1-(2,6-diisopropyl-1,4- xxxd2299xxx )-glucuronide (1quinol
glucuronide),
and
4-(2,6-diisopropyl-1,4- xxxd2299xxx )glucuronide (4- xxxd2299xxx  glucuronide (fig. (115)) [938-941]. these
conjugates can be readily detected as the major metabolites in the
plasma and urine. at least four other minor conjugated metabolites
have also been detected [939-942]. by 24 hr, 50.9 % of the dose of
propofol was recovered as metabolites in patients [943]. the proportions of propofol metabolites, 1- xxxd2299xxx  glucuronide, 4- xxxd2299xxx 

glucuronide, propofol glucuronide and 4- xxxd2299xxx  sulphate recovered
in urine over 24 hr of the patients were 12, 8, 76 and 4%, respectively [943]. in humans, total recovery of propofol in the metabolites studied amounts to 38%, of which 62% was via the glucuronide metabolite and 38% via cyps [944]. the para-hydroxylation of
propofol phenyl ring to 2,6-diisopropyl-1,4- xxxd2299xxx  (1-4- xxxd2299xxx ; 4oh-propofol) is catalyzed by  xxxg582xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c18, 2c19,
1a1 and 1a2 which is the rate-limiting step in the formation of the
subsequent conjugates [945]. overall,  xxxg583xxx  and 2c9 play a
major role in propofol para-hydroxylation [945, 946]. propofol is a
specific substrate for ugt1a8 and 1a9 [947].
4.2.34. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)
several ssris including citalopram [948-951], fluoxetine [952,
953], sertraline [954-956], and paroxetine [957] are mainly metabolized by cyp2d6 and 2c19, but cyp2c9 and 3a4 also significantly contribute to their disposition in vitro. citalopram is mainly
metabolized to n-desmethylcitalopram and further demethylated to
didesmethylcitalopram, while fluoxetine is primarily metabolized
via n-demethylation by cyp2d6, 2c19, 2c9, and 3a4.
4.2.34.1. citalopram
citalopram, an ssri used to treat major depression associated
with mood disorders, is converted to n-desmethylcitalopram (nnorcitalopram) then to n,n-didesmethylcitalopram and citalopram
n-oxide [958]. citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, while
escitalopram is the s-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram, which
has been marketed as a drug as only the s-enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect [959]. clinical studies have demonstrated that steady-state concentrations of r-citalopram exceed

(115). metabolism of propofol. propofol is excreted mainly as the glucuronide of parent drug and sulfate and glucuronide of the para-hydroxylated metabolite in the urine. the conjugation of the para-hydroxylated metabolite forms 4-(2, 6-diisopropyl-1, 4- xxxd2299xxx )-sulphate, 1-(2, 6-diisopropyl-1, 4- xxxd2299xxx )glucuronide (1- xxxd2299xxx  glucuronide), and 4-(2, 6-diisopropyl-1, 4- xxxd2299xxx )-glucuronide (4- xxxd2299xxx  glucuronide. these conjugates can be detected as major metabolites in human plasma and urine. at least four other minor conjugated metabolites have also been detected. the para-hydroxylation of propofol phenyl ring to
2,6-diisopropyl-1,4- xxxd2299xxx  (1-4- xxxd2299xxx ; 4-oh-propofol) is catalyzed by  xxxg582xxx , 2b6, 2c8, 2c18, 2c19, 1a1 and 1a2 which is the rate-limiting step in the
formation of the subsequent conjugates. overall,  xxxg583xxx  and 2c9 play a major role in propofol para-hydroxylation. propofol is a specific substrate for
ugt1a8 and 1a9.

fig. (116). metabolism of citalopram. citalopram is converted to n-desmethylcitalopram (n-norcitalopram) then to n, n-didesmethylcitalopram and citalopram
n-oxide. citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, while escitalopram is the s-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram, which has been marketed as a drug as only
the s-enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. cyp3a4, 2c19 and 2d6 are involved in the first demethylation step of citalopram, all favouring conversion of the biologically active s-enantiomer (escitalopram). cyp2d6 exclusively mediated the second demethylation step, and citalopram n-oxide was also
exclusively formed by cyp2d6.

those of s-citalopram during chronic administration of racemic
citalopram to humans, and that the elimination half-life of rcitalopram exceeds that of s-citalopram [960-962]. cyp3a4, 2c19
and 2d6 are involved in the first demethylation step of citalopram,
all favouring conversion of the biologically active s-enantiomer
(escitalopram) (fig. (116)) [950, 951]. the approximate relative
contribution at low substrate concentrations was estimated to be
34% for cyp3a4, 36% for cyp2c19, and 30% for cyp2d6 [951].
inhibitor studies indicated that was responsible for 40-50% of ndesmethylcitalopram formation at therapeutic citalopram concentrations cyp3a4, while the contribution of cyp2c19 increased and
that of cyp2d6 tended to decrease with increasing drug concentration. cyp2d6 exclusively catalyzed the second demethylation step,
and citalopram n-oxide was also exclusively formed by cyp2d6
[950]. however, none of the studied cyp enzymes mediated
deamination to the  xxxd3029xxx  derivative.
4.2.34.2. fluoxetine
fluoxetine is a widely used ssri indicated for a variety of psychopathological conditions, including mood and eating disorders,
obsessive-compulsive disorders, and dysthymia [963]. fluoxetine
inhibits its own metabolism. after a single dose, the elimination
half-life is 1-3 days. after long-term administration, the elimination
half-life averages 4 days. the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine appears nonlinear [963]. in humans, fluoxetine is mainly metabolised
to n-demethylfluoxetine (norfluoxetine), which seems to have a
similar pharmacological activity to the parent drug [964]. other

metabolic
pathways
include
o-dealkylation
to
paratrifluoromethylphenol and glucuronidation of both fluoxetine and
norfluoxetine. cyp2d6 is largely responsible for the formation of
active r- and s-norfluoxetine from fluoxetine via n-demethylation
at low concentrations, with increased contribution from cyp3a4
and 2c9 when substrate concentrations increase and cyp2d6 becomes saturated (fig. (117)) [952, 965]. a large interindividual
variability exists in the plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and
norfluoxetine after administration of the same dose of the drug,
which may be partly related to the different activity of cyp2d6 and
cyp2c9. among 41 white european psychiatric patients with two
cyp2d6 active genes, the dose-corrected plasma concentrations of
fluoxetine and active moiety (fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine) were
significantly (p<0.05) higher in the individuals carrying the
cyp2c9*1/*2 or cyp2c9*1/*3 genotype than in cyp2c9*1/*1
[966]. in this steady-state study, the patients were on continuous
fluoxetine therapy for at least 45 days before the study and the
fluoxetine dose ranged from 10 to 60 mg/day with an average dose
of 25.2 mg/day. the dose-corrected plasma concentrations of
fluoxetine were 21.6, 13.0 and 14.1 nmol/l/mg for cyp2c9*2/*2,
*2/*3 and *3/*3 genotypes, respectively [966].
4.2.35. sulfonylurea hypoglycemics
sulfonylureas are an important group of oral hypoglycemic
agents used for the treatment of type ii diabetes.  xxxd3394xxx ,
 xxxd1678xxx ,  xxxd3392xxx  and  xxxd65xxx  are first-generation
sulfonylureas while  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2204xxx  are second-generation

fig. (117). metabolism of fluoxetine. fluoxetine is metabolized extensively by the hepatic cyp enzymes, and <2.5% of the drug is found unchanged in human
urine. there are two major metabolic routes for fluoxetine: n-demethylation to norfluoxetine and o-dealkylation to p-trifluoromethylphenol. cyp2d6 is
largely responsible for the formation of r- and s-norfluoxetine from fluoxetine via n-demethylation at low concentrations, with increased contribution from
cyp3a4 and 2c9 when substrate concentrations increase and cyp2d6 becomes saturated. cyp2c19 and 3a4 are responsible for fluoxetine o-dealkylation.

sulfonylureas [967]. hydroxylation of the aromatic ring appears to
be the most favored metabolic pathway for these sulfonylureas. the
hydroxylated derivatives have much lower hypoglycemic activity
than the parent compounds. cyp2c9 is the principal catalyst for the
methyl hydroxylation of  xxxd3394xxx  to 4-oh- xxxd3394xxx  [968970], but cyp2c19 also plays a role for this reaction [126, 971,
972].
4.2.35.1.  xxxd1678xxx 
 xxxd1678xxx  is a long-acting sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic
agent used in the treatment of type ii diabetes [973]. there is an up
to a 30-fold difference in steady-state serum  xxxd1678xxx  concentrations and plasma clearances in patients receiving therapeutic
dosing [974].  xxxd1678xxx  has a higher incidence of hypoglycaemic after normal dosing than do other sulphonylureas, which is
partially due to its longer duration and higher potency [975, 976].
 xxxd1678xxx  is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract
[977]. within one hr after a single oral dose, it is readily detectable
in the blood, and the level reaches a maximum within two to four hr
[978-981].  xxxd1678xxx  was extensively metabolized in human
liver up to 80% of a single dose and several of its metabolites, including 2-hydroxychlorpropamide, 3-hydroxychlorpropamide, pchlorobenzene sulphonylurea, and p-chlorobenzene sulphonamide,
were identified in human urine after oral dosing (fig. (118)) [982,
983]. 2-oh- xxxd1678xxx  was formed by both cyp2c9 and
2c19 [984]. in vivo,  xxxd1678xxx  disposition was affected by
cyp2c9, but not cyp2c19 genetic polymorphism [984]. the estimated nonrenal clearance of  xxxd1678xxx  was significantly decreased in cyp2c9*1/*3 subjects compared with homozygous
cyp2c9*1/*1 subjects. the metabolic ratio of  xxxd1678xxx / xxxd346xxx - xxxd1678xxx  in urine for 24 hr was also significantly higher
in the cyp2c9*1/*3 subjects than in the cyp2c9*1/*1 subjects.

patients taking phenytoin, carbamazepine or rifampin showed faster
clearance of  xxxd1678xxx  [985-987], suggesting a possible induction of metabolism and a dose increase may be required.
4.2.35.2.  xxxd2202xxx 
 xxxd2202xxx , a second-generation sulfonylurea used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [988]. it is extensively metabolized in humans and multiple urinary metabolites, mainly methylhydroxygliclazide and carboxygliclazide, have been identified
[989]. like the structurally related 4-methylsulphonylureas  xxxd3394xxx  [971, 990] and  xxxd3404xxx  [657], tolylmethyl hydroxylation
followed by oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acid is the
major metabolic pathway (fig. (119)). in addition,  xxxd2202xxx  is
hydroxylated in the azabicyclooctyl ring with the potential to form
seven monohydroxylated metabolites. of these, four monohydroxyazabicyclooctyl metabolites (at the 6-, 6-, 7- and 7- positions)
have been identified in human urine [989, 991]. based on metabolite excretion in urine to 96 hr postdose, methyl hydroxy- (as this
metabolite plus the derived carboxylic acid), 6-oh-, 6-oh, 7oh- and 7-oh- xxxd2202xxx  accounted for 59, 1, 20, 6 and 14% of
the recovered dose, respectively [991]. in vitro studies have indicated that cyp2c9 is the major contributor to  xxxd2202xxx  6-, 7- and
methyl hydroxylation, although cyp2c19 may also be involved in
the methyl hydroxylation of  xxxd2202xxx  [992]. recombinant
cyp2c9, 2c18 and 2c19 catalysed all three hydroxylation pathways for  xxxd2202xxx , whereas  xxxg586xxx  catalyzed 6- and 7hydroxylation only. zhang et al. [993] recently investigated the
relationship of cyp2c9 genotype and the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2202xxx  modified release in 24 healthy volunteers. in the single-dose
study, the cyp2c9*1/*13 subjects had 2-fold higher auc and
cmax values and 2-fold longer t1/2 than *1/*1 and *1/*3 subjects

(119). metabolism of  xxxd2202xxx  by cyp2c9 and 2c19.  xxxd2202xxx  is extensively metabolized in humans and multiple urinary metabolites have been identified. like the structurally related 4-methylsulphonylureas  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd3404xxx , tolylmethyl hydroxylation followed by oxidation to the corresponding
carboxylic acid is the major metabolic pathway. in addition,  xxxd2202xxx  is hydroxylated in the azabicyclooctyl ring with the potential to form seven monohydroxylated metabolites. of these, four monohydroxy-azabicyclooctyl metabolites (at the 6-, 6-, 7- and 7- positions) have been identified in human urine.
based on metabolite excretion in urine to 96 hr postdose, methyl hydroxy- (as this metabolite plus the derived carboxylic acid), 6-oh-, 6-oh, 7-oh- and
7-oh- xxxd2202xxx  accounted for 59, 1, 20, 6 and 14% of the recovered dose, respectively. in vitro studies have indicated that cyp2c9 is the major contributor
to  xxxd2202xxx  6-, 7- and methyl hydroxylation, although cyp2c19 may also be involved in the methyl hydroxylation of  xxxd2202xxx . recombinant cyp2c9,
2c18 and 2c19 catalysed all three hydroxylation pathways for  xxxd2202xxx , whereas  xxxg586xxx  catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation only.

(auc: 46.8 vs 26.9 vs 21.5 g •hr/ml), but the difference did not
achieve statistical significance.
4.2.35.3.  xxxd2203xxx 
 xxxd2203xxx , a third-generation sulfonylurea, is considered safe
and effective antidiabetic agent [994, 995]. following either an

intravenous or oral dose,  xxxd2203xxx  is completely metabolized by
oxidative biotransformation to a major metabolite, cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl derivative (m1), via cyp2c9. m1 is further metabolized via dehydrogenation by cytosolic alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases to the carboxyl derivative (m2) (fig. (120)). m1, but
not m2, possessed some pharmacologic activity in human study

reported to be 80–100%. the t1/2 of  xxxd2204xxx  averages 3–4.7 hr (range: 2–7.3 hr) and thus it has a medium-to-long acting duration.  xxxd2204xxx  is almost completely metabolized, mainly in the liver. the drug is metabolized principally at the cyclohexyl ring to 4-trans-hydroxyglipizide; the drug is also metabolized to
the 3-cis-hydroxy derivative, dcda, and at least 2 unidentified metabolites.  xxxd2204xxx  and its metabolites are excreted principally in urine (60-90%). less than
10% of a dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug within 24 hr, about 20–60% as the 4-trans-hydroxy metabolite, 10–15% as the 3-cis-hydroxy metabolite,
1–2% as dcda, and the remainder as unidentified metabolites. there is no in vitro data on the cyps involved in the metabolism of  xxxd2204xxx , but cyp2c9 is
supposed to be the major contributor to its metabolism.

[996]. however, whether the glucose-lowering effect of m1 is
clinically significant is unclear. approximately 60% of an oral dose
was excreted renally, primarily as m1 and m2 metabolites (8090%), while fecal excretion accounted for approximately 40% of an
oral dose, primarily as m1 and m2 metabolites (70%) [997]. the
plasma auc of  xxxd2203xxx  was 2.67-fold higher in healthy subjects harboring the cyp2c9*1/*3 genotype than in subjects carrying
the wild-type after a single dose [998]. however, there was no significant difference in blood glucose levels between the two genotypes. a single-dose clinical study found a 1.3- and 1.5-fold higher
auc of  xxxd2203xxx  in healthy chinese volunteers with the
cyp2c9*1/*3 and *3/*3 genotypes, respectively [999]. in this study,
the metabolic clearance of  xxxd2203xxx  to m1 (and subsequent inactive m2) was significantly decreased in individuals harbouring the
cyp2c9*1/*3 genotype.

4.2.35.4.  xxxd2204xxx

(122). metabolism of  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd2215xxx ) by cyp2c9 and 2c19.  xxxd2215xxx  is extensively metabolized by the liver and two  xxxd2215xxx  metabolites
that have been identified in and patient urine, namely, 4-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl  xxxd2215xxx  (m1) and 3-cis-hydroxycyclohexyl  xxxd2215xxx  (m2). these two
metabolites are pharmacologically active with potent hypoglycaemic effects. studies in human hepatic and placental microsomes have found the formation of
four additional metabolites: 4-cis-(m2a), 3-trans-(m3), and 2-trans-(m4) hydroxycyclohexyl  xxxd2215xxx , and ethyl-hydroxy  xxxd2215xxx  (m5).  xxxd2215xxx  is
mainly metabolized by cyp3a4, with substantial contribution from cyp2c9 and 2c19.

20–60% as the 4-trans-hydroxy metabolite, 10–15% as the 3-cishydroxy metabolite, 1–2% as dcda, and the remainder as unidentified metabolites [1002]. there is no in vitro data on the cyps
involved in the metabolism of  xxxd2204xxx . in a bioavailability study of
 xxxd2204xxx , one male caucasian subject showed severe hypoglycemia
associated with a 5.5-fold higher auc and 5-fold lower clearance
than the values for the other 10 subjects participating in the study
[1003]. this unusual subject was later found to carry the homozygous cyp2c9*3/*3 genotype and to show 5-fold lower clearance of
phenytoin which is mainly metabolized by cyp2c9 than other 11
subjects [1003].
4.2.35.5.  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd2215xxx )
 xxxd2215xxx  is a second-generation sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic
agent that has been used successfully for controlling glucose levels
in women with progestational and gestational diabetes mellitus

[1004-1006].  xxxd2215xxx  is extensively metabolized by the liver and
two  xxxd2215xxx  metabolites that have been identified in patient urine,
namely, 4-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl  xxxd2215xxx  (m1) and 3-cishydroxycyclohexyl  xxxd2215xxx  (m2) [1007]. these two metabolites
are pharmacologically active with potent hypoglycaemic effects
[1008]. studies in human hepatic and placental microsomes have
found the formation of four additional metabolites: 4-cis-(m2a), 3trans-(m3), and 2-trans-(m4) hydroxycyclohexyl  xxxd2215xxx , and
ethyl-hydroxy  xxxd2215xxx  (m5) (fig. (122)) [1009, 1010].  xxxd2215xxx 
is mainly metabolized by cyp3a4, with substantial contribution
from cyp2c9 and 2c19 [1011].
4.2.35.6.  xxxd3394xxx 
 xxxd3394xxx  is a first-generation sulphonylurea hypoglycemic
agent used to lower blood glucose levels in patients with type ii
diabetes if diet alone is not effective [1012, 1013].  xxxd3394xxx  is
less potent than second-generation sulphonylureas such as  xxxd2204xxx

since cyp2c9 plays an important role in the metabolism of
sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic drugs, cyp2c9*3 (but not cyp2c9*2)
has been clearly implicated in impaired clearance of  xxxd3394xxx ,
 xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx , and  xxxd2702xxx . data on the relationship
between cyp2c9 genotype and the clearance of  xxxd2204xxx  or  xxxd2202xxx  are scant. individuals heterozygous and homozygous for
cyp2c9*3 had 2- and 6-fold higher auc of  xxxd3394xxx  than the
wild-type [13, 1017]. the estimated alteration in auc of serum

and  xxxd2215xxx  and it is not routinely used due to a higher incidence
of adverse effects compared to newer second-generation sulfonylureas such as  xxxd2215xxx  [1014].  xxxd3394xxx  is mainly metabolized
via methylhydroxylation by cyp2c9 to 4-oh- xxxd3394xxx  [968970, 1015] and thus is often used as a probe substrate for determining cyp2c9 activity (fig. (123)).  xxxg586xxx  and 2c19 play a minor
role for this reaction [126, 971, 972, 1016]. 4-oh- xxxd3394xxx  is
further oxidized to carboxytolbutamide. studies using the monospecific antibody for cyp2c9 have indicated that cyp2c9 cata-

the non-sulfonylurea meglitinide derivatives, commonly called
glinides including  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  (fig.
(124)), have been developed for improving insulin secretion of
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. glinides stimulate insulin
secretion by closing the atp-sensitive k+ channels, with subsequent gating of voltage-sensitive calcium channels in pancreatic cells [1018]. they are increasingly used either in monotherapy or in
combination with other oral antihyperglycemic agents for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. glinides including  xxxd3098xxx  and
 xxxd2702xxx  are all metabolised by cyp3a4 [1019].  xxxd3098xxx  is
also metabolised by  xxxg586xxx  [1020], while  xxxd2702xxx  metabolism
also involves cyp2c9 [1021].  xxxd2654xxx  is mainly glucuronidated
by  xxxg2383xxx  and 2b7 [1022].
4.2.36.1.  xxxd2702xxx 
 xxxd2702xxx , lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of
insulin from the pancreas through the closure of atp-dependent
potassium channels in the membrane of the  cells [1023-1025].
 xxxd2702xxx  is metabolized extensively by the liver, and has an
elimination half-life of 1.5-1.7 hr. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2702xxx  are linear over 60-240 mg [1021], with an oral bioavailability
of 72%. no significant pharmacokinetic alteration occurs in renally
impaired patients, in the elderly, or in patients with mild hepatic
impairment [1021].  xxxd2702xxx  is extensively metabolized (70%)
with excretion predominantly (84–87%) in urine. after oral and
intravenous dosing of  xxxd2702xxx , at least nine metabolites were
identified in human plasma and urine (fig. (125)) [1026]. three of

4.2.37. statins and non-statin lipid-lowing agents
inhibitors of  xxxg1060xxx  ( xxxg1060xxx ), also known as “statins”, represent an
important group of therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. five drugs of this class are currently approved
for use in the united states, namely, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin (fig. (126)). atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are all good substrates of cyp3a4/3a5
[1027-1029], while fluvastatin is mainly metabolized by cyp2c9

[1030]. lovastatin is a prodrug and is converted by esterases from
its lactone to the active, open acid form.  xxxd461xxx , which was
withdrawn from the market in august 2001 due to an unacceptably
high rate of rhabdomyolysis, is mainly metabolized by  xxxg586xxx 
and 3a4 [1031, 1032]. unlike other  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors, cyp3a4-mediated oxidation is only a minor pathway for
pravastatin clearance [1029]. furthermore, simvastatin, atorvastatin,
 xxxd461xxx  and fluvastatin have been shown to induce cyp3a4,
2b6, and 2c9 through transactivation of car and  xxxg1598xxx  [1033].
however, pravastatin does not inhibit or induce any cyps, possibly
due to its hydrophilic nature [1034].
4.2.37.1. fluvastatin
fluvastatin is almost exclusively eliminated via metabolism,
mainly hydroxylation, at the 5- and 6-position of the indole moiety
and n-deisopropylation (fig. (127)) [1035]. fluvastatin is 50-80%
metabolized by cyp2c9 to 5-hydroxy-, 6-hydroxy-, and ndeisopropyl-fluvastatin [1030]. recombinant  xxxg575xxx , 2c8,
cyp2c9, 2d6, and 3a4 form only 5-hydroxy-fluvastatin. only the
hydroxylated metabolites retain some  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitory activity, yet they are not detected in the systemic circulation
[1036]. however, cyp3a4 is the major enzyme metabolizing most
 xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors, including lovastatin [1037], simvastatin [1027, 1038, 1039], atorvastatin [1028], and  xxxd461xxx

(128). metabolism of lk-935 by cyp2c9 and 3a4. cyp2c9 and cyp3a4 are the predominant enzymes involved in the n-dealkylation and hydroxylation of lk-935, yielding m1, m2, m3a, m3b, and two minor metabolites m4a and m4b. m1 resulted from the cleavage of the propyl group from the tertiary
amine; while the hydroxylation of m3b on the pyridine ring was catalyzed by cyp2c9 and 3a4. m2 was produced through cyp3a4-mediated cleavage of the
hydroxyethyl-pyridine part and m3a was generated by cyp2c9-mediated hydroxylation at the propyl group. m4a and m4b were formed from m2 via further
hydroxylation at the propyl group.

[1031]. these statins are subject to potential drug interactions with
 xxxg590xxx  inhibitors. although fluvastatin has been reported to inhibit
 xxxg590xxx  competitively at a high concentration (200 m) [1040],
 xxxg590xxx  is not the major enzyme responsible for the elimination of
fluvastatin in vivo.
4.2.37.2. lk-935
lk-935 (2-((3,4-dichlorophenethyl)(propy)amino)-1-(pyridine3-yl)ethanol), a pyridylethanol(phenylethy)amine derivative, is a
novel nonstatin-type cholesterol-lowering agent targeting enzymes
below the  xxxd2086xxx  branchpoint of cholesterol biosynthesis [1041]. lk-935 has been identified as a post-lanosterol
cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, targeting  xxxg596xxx  that is responsible for the removal of the 14-methyl of lanosterol and 24,25dihydrolanosterol to yield follicular fluid meiosis activating sterol
(so-called lanosterol 14-demethylase) [1042]. lk-935 is an efficient inhibitor of  xxxg596xxx , and its inhibition leads to a substantial
accumulation of lanosterol and block the formation of cholesterol
and post-lanosterol intermediates completely [1041]. cyp2c9 and
cyp3a4 are the predominant enzymes involved in the ndealkylation and hydroxylation of lk-935, yielding m1, m2, m3a,
m3b, and two minor metabolites m4a and m4b (fig. (128)) [1043].
m1 resulted from the cleavage of the propyl group from the tertiary
amine; while the hydroxylation of m3b on the pyridine ring was
catalyzed by cyp2c9 and 3a4. m2 was produced through
cyp3a4-mediated cleavage of the hydroxyethyl-pyridine part and
m3a was generated by cyp2c9-mediated hydroxylation at the
propyl group. m4a and m4b were formed from m2 via further hydroxylation at the propyl group. like atorvastatin and rosuvastatin,
lk-935 was an inducer of cyp3a4 through transactivation of nuclear receptors in human hepatocytes [1043]. however, lk-935 did

not induce cyp2c9 and 2b6 which were significantly induced by
atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.
4.2.37.3. rosuvastatin
rosuvastatin, like other statins, is an  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor containing a polar methyl sulfonamide group [1044, 1045].
rosuvastatin exerts a variety of advantageous pharmacological
profiles, including its hydrophilic feature, selective absorption via
heptatocytes, enhanced  xxxg1060xxx  binding characteristics [1044, 1046]. rosuvastatin molecule has a polar methyl sulfonamide group except for the standard statin pharmacophore compared with other statins. this group can lead to a unique interaction
with  xxxg1060xxx . furthermore, a polar pond is shaped
between the electronegative sulfone group and the arg568 residue
of the enzyme. therefore, rosuvastatin has the highest binding affinity to  xxxg1060xxx  with a ki of 0.1 nm [1047-1049].
the oral bioavailibity of rosuvastatin is about 20%. due to its
high hydrophilicity, rosuvastatin is minimally metabolized by hepatic enzymes, with 90% of the unchanged parent drug excreted
into the feces [1050]. the major metabolite in the excreta following
rosuvastatin administration was n-desmethylrosuvastatin, and another minor one was rosuvastatin-5s-lactone (fig. (129)). the desmethylated derivative was pharmacologically active. the formation
of n-desmethylrosuvastatin was catalyzed by cyp2c9 with lesser
contribution from 2c19 but other cyps played no or minor effect
[1051]. rosuvastatin is a substrate of multiple trasnporters in hepatocytes which facilitate the uptake of the drug into the hepatocytes
[1052, 1053]. because of the minor role of cyp2c9 and 2c19 in
the overall clearance of rosuvastatin (<10%), the potential for drugdrug interactions owing to cyp2c inhibiton is minimal, but there is

4.2.39.1.  xxxd3256xxx 

seratrodast is a thromboxane receptor 2 antagonist used
primarily in the treatment of asthma [1054, 1055]. animal studies
indicate that phase ii conjugation was more extensive than phase i
reactions in the overall elimination of seratrodast. in the rat, dog
and monkey, seratrodast was converted to m1, m2 (4’hydroxyseratrodast) and m3 (5-methylhydroxyseratrodast) by oxidation of the  xxxd2269xxx  moiety, 4’-hydroxylation of the
phenyl group in the side chain, and hydroxylation of the 5-methyl
group in the benzoquinone ring, respectively (fig. (130)) [1056].
seratrodast was also reduced to hydroquinone derivative
(dihydroseratrodast) which was subsequently conjugated at the 4hydroxy group in the hydroquinone ring. in human liver microsomes, several cyps including cyp2c and 3a converted seratrodast to two metabolites, 5-methylhydroxyseratrodast (m3), a major
product, and 4’-hydroxyseratrodast (m2), a minor one (fig. (130))
[1057]. the formation of 5-methylhydroxy metabolite (m3) was
catalyzed by recombinant cyp3a4, 2c9, 2c8 and 2c19 and 2b6,
with 2c9 showing the highest activity followed by 2c8. recombinant  xxxg586xxx , 2c9, and cyp2c19, but not 3a4, formed the minor
4-hydroxy metabolite, with  xxxg586xxx  and 2c19 being the most efficient catalysts [1057]. inhibition studies indicated that cyp3a4 and
2c9 were the major contributors to the formation of 5methylhydroxyseratrodast, with minor contributions from 2c8 and
2c19 [1057]. in contrast, recombinant cyp1a2,  xxxd577xxx , 2d6,  xxxd851xxx 
were not involved in the formation of both hydroxylated metabolites when incubated with seratrodast. in addition, seratrodast was a

 xxxd3256xxx  is a sulfoxide-containing uricosuric agent used
in the treatment of gout and hyperuricaemia [1058, 1059]. it contains a chiral sulfoxide group and thus exists in two enantiomers.
like other sulfoxide-containing drugs, it is subject to both oxidation
and reduction, with at least nine metabolites identified in human
urine [1060-1062]. structurally, all the metabolites except one are
compounds with the sulfur atom in various states of oxidation (sulfide, sulfoxide, or sulfone), either alone or in combination with a
para-hydroxy n-phenyl group or a c4-glucuronide. the exceptional
metabolite is 4-hydroxylated derivative. the sulfide results from
reductive metabolism mediated by intestinal bacteria [1063]. during multiple dosing treatment of  xxxd3256xxx , the sulfide and
sulfone metabolites appeared as the major metabolites in the human
plasma [1064]. at steady state, the plasma concentration level of
sulfide was similar to or higher than that of the parent drug [1062].
 xxxd3256xxx  and its major metabolites are all inhibitors of
cyp2c9 [1065].
in human liver microsomes,  xxxd3256xxx  sulfide was converted back to several  xxxd3256xxx  enantiomers and two minor
phenolic metabolites (a and b) (fig. (131)) [1066]. in metabolite
a, the thiophenyl ring was hydroxylated, whereas an n-phenyl ring
was hydroxylated in metabolite b.  xxxd3256xxx  was further oxidized to  xxxd3256xxx  sulfone and a minor polar metabolite resulting from n-phenyl ring hydroxylation ( xxxd1811xxx ). metabolite
formation was unaffected by thermal treatment, but it was dramatically decreased when the incubations were conducted at ph 9.0 and
virtually abolished at ph 9.0 in the presence of a detergent. as such,

from its sulfide was catalyzed by cyp2c9 and 3a4 as determined
by the inhibitor studies and studies in recombinant enzymes, but
cyp3a4 was approximately 10 times more active than cyp2c9.
cyp3a4 catalysed the oxidation of  xxxd3256xxx  to sulfone and
the formation of  xxxd1811xxx  [1066]. cyp2c9 formed  xxxd3256xxx  with a high degree of stereo-selectivity, favoring the enantiomer with the shortest chromatographic retention time by a ratio of

ratio of about 3:2.

xanthine alkaloid found naturally in coffee, kola seed kernels or
nuts (cola nidtida), and a variety of teas. caffeine together with
phenacetin and theophylline have been frequently used as probe
substrates for determining the activity of cyp1a2 in vivo [1071].
caffeine is predominantly (95% of a dose) metabolized by
cyp1a2 to three metabolic dimethylxanthines via n-

demethylations and one hydroxylated metabolite via c8 hydroxylation (fig. (133)) and thus is usually used as a “gold standard” probe for determining cyp1a2 activity [1072-1078]. the n3 demethylation by cyp1a2 to paraxanthine (1,7- xxxd3344xxx ,

fig. (133). the metabolic of caffeine by cyp1a2 and other cyps. caffeine is primarily (95%) metabolised by cyp1a2 to three dimethylxanthines. the 1-,
3- and 7-demethylation of caffeine forms theobromine (accounting for 12%), paraxanthine (17x, 1,7- xxxd3344xxx , 84%) and theophylline (4%), respectively. n1-deemthylation of caffeine was exclusively catalyzed by cyp1a2, while its n7-demethylation was mainly catalyzed by cyp1a2 and to a lesser
extent by  xxxg586xxx /9, 3a4 and  xxxd851xxx . both cyp1a2 and 3a4 preferentially catalyzed c8-hydroxylation, with smaller contributions from  xxxg586xxx /9 and  xxxd851xxx .
at a higher caffeine concentration, the contribution of cyp1a2 to this reaction decreased in favor of  xxxg586xxx /9.

demethylation largely reflected cyp1a2 activity when the substrate concentration was 0.1 mm in vitro, but cyp1a2 contributed
to only 70% of the paraxanthine (17x) formation at 1 mm of caffeine [1074]. n1-deemthylation of caffeine was exclusively catalyzed by cyp1a2, while its n7-demethylation was mainly catalyzed by cyp1a2 and to a lesser extent by  xxxg586xxx /9, 3a4 and
 xxxd851xxx  [1078, 1083-1086]. both cyp1a2 and 3a4 preferentially catalyzed c8-hydroxylation, with smaller contributions from  xxxg586xxx /9
and  xxxd851xxx  [1078]. at a higher caffeine concentration, the contribution
of cyp1a2 to this reaction decreased in favor of  xxxg586xxx /9. in
addition, cyp1a2 was involved in the further metabolism of paraxanthine (17x) to 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil
(afmu), 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17u), 1-methyluracil (1u) and 1methylxanthine (1x) [1073]. the metabolic ratios based on urine
levels of caffeine and its metabolites in a 24-hr urine collection
correlate well with oral caffeine clearance [1075]. both the caffeine/paraxanthine ratio and systemic clearance of caffeine correlate
well with cyp1a2 activity. overall, cyp2c9 plays a minor role
only in the elimination of caffeine.
4.2.40.3. dextromethorphan
dextromethorphan is a synthetic analog of narcotic analgesics
used as an over-the-counter antitussive agent that acts as an nmethyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist [1087, 1088]. in humans, it
is primarily excreted as unchanged parent drug and dextrorphan
[1089] which is a pharmacologically active metabolite [1090]. the
formation of dextrorphan from dextromethorphan is primarily me-

diated by cyp2d6 via o-demethylation (fig. (134)) [1091, 1092]
and cosegregates with the  xxxd1818xxx /sparteine-type (cyp2d6mediated) oxidative polymorphism [1093, 1094]. dextromethorphan is now widely used as a probe substrate for determining
cyp2d6 activity both in vivo [1094, 1095] and in vitro [1094].
dextromethorphan is also converted to 3-methoxymorphinan via nn,odemethylation,
and
to
3-hydroxymorphinan via
didemethylation in humans [1089]. cyp3a4 is the principal enzyme involved in the n-demethylation pathway, with certain contribution from cyp2d6 [1092, 1096]. interestingly, cyp2c9 showed
clear activity towards the basic nitrogencontaining compound and
cyp2d6 probe substrate, dextromethorphan [42], catalysing its odemethylation to dextrorphan with kcat of 1.8 min1 and km of 290
m, values quite comparable with those for the classic 2c9 substrate  xxxd3394xxx . cyp2c9 was found to catalyze both o- and ndemethylation of dextromethorphan, with the rate of ndemethylation being slower than that of o-demethylation.
4.2.40.4.  xxxd2182xxx  (gv150526)
 xxxd2182xxx  (gv150526, 3-[-2(phenylcarbamoyl) ethenyl]-4,6dichloroindole-2-carboxylic acid) is a novel, highly potent 2carboxyindole glycine antagonist indicated for stroke. it binds to
the glycine site of nmda receptors [1097]. although this drug
demonstrated significant neuroprotective effect in animal models
[1098],  xxxd2182xxx  did not show significant therapeutic effects in
patients with acute stroke [1099-1101]. in stroked patients treated
with 100-, 200-, or 400-mg maintenance doses given every 12 hr,

(134). metabolism of dextromethorphan by cyp2d6. in humans, dextromethorphan is primarily excreted as unchanged parent drug and dextrorphan
which is a pharmacologically active metabolite. the formation of dextrorphan from dextromethorphan is primarily mediated by cyp2d6 via o-demethylation
and cosegregates with the  xxxd1818xxx -sparteine-type oxidative polymorphism. dextromethorphan is also converted to 3-methoxymorphinan via ndemethylation, and to 3-hydroxymorphinan via n,o-didemethylation in humans. cyp3a4 is the principal enzyme involved in the n-demethylation pathway,
with contribution from cyp2d6. cyp2c9 was found to catalyze both o- and n-demethylation of dextromethorphan, with the rate of n-demethylation being
slower than that of o-demethylation.

the mean elimination half-life ranged from 29 to 56 hr [1102]. after
a single intravenous administration of 800 mg  xxxd2182xxx  to healthy
volunteers, at least six metabolites were identified in the urine and
plasma including several conjugates [1103]. m3a/b, m4 and m5a/b
were identified as glucuronic acid metabolites, and m1 was the
sulfate of hydroxylated  xxxd2182xxx  (m2) (fig. (135)). when incubated with human liver slices, three glucuronide metabolites were
formed; but only one metabolite resulted from hydroxylation on the
para-position of the phenyl ring when incubated with human liver
microsomes [1103]. recombinant cyp2c9 and 3a4 to a lesser
extent hydroxylated  xxxd2182xxx . ugt1a1, 1a3, 1a9, and 2b4 were
involved in the glucuronidation of  xxxd2182xxx  [1103, 1104].
4.2.40.5.  xxxd2450xxx 
 xxxd2450xxx  is a novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drug
used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. [1105] upon oral absorption, it is
converted to the 2-cyano-3-oxo-n-[(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]butyramide (a771726) that inhibits de novo synthesis of pyrimidine
ribonucleotides and leads to a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation.
the principal biotransformation pathway of  xxxd2450xxx  in humans

involves an n-o bond cleavage on its isoxazole ring, leading to the
formation of a771726 that resides in the same oxidation state as the
parent drug (fig. (136)) [1106]. a771726 is responsible for the antiinflammatory and disease-modifying properties of  xxxd2450xxx 
[1106]. in vitro studies have demonstrated that cyp1a2, 2c19, and
3a4 are involved in  xxxd2450xxx  activation [1107]. in a study with
105 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was no significant
association between the cyp2c9 genotype and the  xxxd2450xxx 
toxicity. [1108] although cyp2c9 was not reported to be involved
in  xxxd2450xxx  metabolism, cyp2c9*3/*3 genotype has been associated with  xxxd2450xxx  drug interactions and toxicity. in two case
reports, patients with rheumatoid arthritis carrying the
cyp2c9*3/*3 genotype that were on ongoing warfarin therapy
developed severe bleeding when cotreated with  xxxd2450xxx  [1109,
1110].
4.2.40.6.  xxxd2481xxx 
 xxxd2481xxx  ( xxxd2481xxx ) is a novel dual inhibitor of cox-1 and
cox-2 and  xxxg147xxx  with antiphlogistic, analgesic, antipyretic, antiasthmatic and antiaggregative activities [1111-1114]. it is

a771726

fig. (136). metabolism of  xxxd2450xxx  by cyps. after oral administration to humans,  xxxd2450xxx  is rapidly metabolized such that circulating concentrations of
 xxxd2450xxx  are mostly below the limit of detection. the principal biotransformation pathway of  xxxd2450xxx  in humans involves an n–o bond cleavage on its
isoxazole ring, leading to the formation of the 2-cyano-3-oxo-n-[(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]butyramide (a771726 or m1) metabolite that resides in the same
oxidation state as the parent drug. a771726 is an active metabolite responsible for largely all the anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying properties of
 xxxd2450xxx . rat and human liver microsomes also demonstrated nadph-dependent a771726 formation, with cyp1a2 being the enzyme responsible for this
reaction. 3-methylleflunomide, which contained a 3-methyl substituent on the isoxazole ring, was resistant to ring opening in base, plasma, blood, and liver
microsomes. in liver microsomes, two monohydroxylated metabolites were formed, and the 3- and the 5-methyl groups on the isoxazole ring were the sites of
hydroxylation. these results indicate that the c3–h in  xxxd2450xxx  is essential for ring opening. although a771726 formation in human liver microsomes or
recombinant cyp1a2 required nadph, its formation was greatly reduced by oxygen or carbon monoxide, suggesting that the isoxazole ring opening was
catalyzed by the p450fe (ii) form of the enzyme.

cyp2j2 was the major enzyme for the formation of m2, with minor contribution from  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9. m4 was formed by cyp2j2, 3a4, 2c8, 2c19 and
2d6.  xxxg2383xxx , 1a9 and 2b7 catalyzed the formation of the acyl glucuronide of  xxxd2481xxx  (m1). minor activity was also observed with  xxxg2384xxx  and 2b15. in

hydroxylated by  xxxg586xxx  [1116].

4.2.40.4. tr-14035
tr-14035 (n-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-(l)-4-(2',6'-bis-methoxyphenyl)phenylalanine) is a novel, potent, dual, and orally administered 41/47 integrin antagonist [1117]. the 41/47 integrins
play an important role in recruiting circulating lymphocytes to the
gastrointestinal tract, where its ligand mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 is preferentially expressed on high endothelial
venules [1118]. it may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. tr-14035
has an oral bioavailability of 17% and 13% in the rat and dog, respectively [1119]. tr-14035 was primarily metabolized by
cyp2c9, giving rise to o-desmethyl tr-14035 (fig. (138)) [1120].

by sulfaphenazole, a selective cyp2c9 inhibitor, and cyp2c9
antibody. of 12 recombinant human cyps examined, o-desmethyl
metabolite was principally formed by cyp2c9.  xxxg575xxx  showed
about one-fourth activity of cyp2c9 and  xxxg586xxx  exhibited low
activity at high substrate concentrations. however, cyp1a2, 1b1,
 xxxd577xxx , 2b6, 2c19, 2d6, 3a4 and 4a11 did not show any activity
[1120]. the catalytic activity of mutated cyp2c9.3 enzyme was
approximately one-sixth of that of cyp2c9.1 and cyp2c9.2. odesmethyl tr-14035 was further sulfated in rat liver microsomes,
but not in human liver microsomes.
further transport studies demonstrated that  xxxg2164xxx  and
 xxxg2165xxx  mediated the uptake of tr-14035 with km of 7.5 and 5.3
m, respectively [1121]. the mutated  xxxg2164xxx .15 enzyme had a
decreased transport of tr-14035 compared with  xxxg2164xxx .1. in
addition, biliary excretion and total body clearance of tr-14035 in
 xxxg15xxx -defective eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats were significantly
lower than those in normal rats, whereas there was no difference in
the clearance between wild and mdr1a/b or  xxxg22xxx -knockout mice
[1121]. this indicates that  xxxg2164xxx  and 1b3 and  xxxg15xxx , but not
 xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg22xxx , are involved in the hepatic uptake and biliary transport of tr-14035.

4.2.41. designer drugs
4.2.41.1. phencyclidine-derived designer drugs
the phencyclidine-derived designer drugs seized on the illicit

n-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-methoxy-propanamine (pcmpa), n-(1phenylcyclohexyl)-3-ethoxypropanamine
(pcepa),
n-(1phenylcyclohexyl)-2-methoxyethanamine (pcmea) and n-(1phenylcyclohexyl)-2-ethoxyethanamine (pceea) (fig. (139))
[1122]. they might be assumed to be similar to those of the structurally related drugs phencyclidine and ketamine, which both act as
antagonists at nmda receptors and have psychotomimetic as well
as anesthetic properties.
the metabolism of pcpr, pcepa, pcmpa, pceea, and
pcmea in rats have recently been studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) methods [1122-1125]. in rats,
pcpr was metabolized by hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring at
different positions, hydroxylation of the phenyl ring, ndealkylation, and combinations of these reactions followed by conjugation (fig. (140)) [1124]. in the acetylated rat urine extract, the

(m19) and n-dealkyl-3′-hydroxy pcpr isomer 2 (m20) [1124].
both pceea and pcmea have similar metabolic pathways
(fig. (141)) & fig. (142)). sauer et al. (2008d) [1125] have found
that pceea and pcmea were mainly metabolized by odealkylation followed by oxidation to the corresponding acid, ndealkylation, hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring at different positions, aromatic hydroxylation, and combinations of these reactions
in rats, resulting in the same metabolites. in rat urine, the following
metabolites of pceea and pcmea have been identified [1125]:
o-deethyl pceea (m3), o-deethyl-hydroxyphenyl pceea (m4),
o-deethyl-4′-hydroxy pceea isomer 1 (m5), o-deethyl-4′hydroxy pceea isomer 2 (m6), o-deethyl-3 -hydroxy pceea

(m19), o-deethyl-4′-cis-hydroxy pceea (m20), and o-deethyl-4′trans-hydroxy pceea (m21).
more recently, sauer et al. (2009) [1126] investigated the metabolism of pceea and pcmea in human liver microsomes and
recombinant cyps. pceea o-deethylation was catalyzed by
 xxxg583xxx , 2c9, 2c19, and 3a4, whereas the o-demethylation of
pcmea was catalyzed only by  xxxg583xxx  and 2c19. in consideration of the relative activity factor, these enzymes accounted for 53,
25, 4, and 18% of net clearance for pceea and 91 and 9% of net
clearance for pcmea, respectively [1126]. as such,  xxxg583xxx  is
the most relevant cyp for o-dealkylation of both compounds, accounting for 53% (pceea) and 91% (pcmea) of the net clearance
and the shorter side chain of pcmea is associated with a higher
contribution of  xxxg583xxx  and lesser contribution of cyp2c9 and
3a4. in the case of the pcpr, the compound with the shortest sidechain,  xxxg583xxx  is the only enzyme involved in side-chain hydroxylation (i.e. 100% net clearance) [1123].
both pcepa and pcmpa had similar metabolic pathways with
exception of mono hydroxylation of the parent drug, which was
observed for pcepa but not for pcmpa (fig. (143) & fig. (144))
[1122]. pcmpa mainly underwent n-dealkylation, o-demethylation partially followed by oxidation of the resulting alcohol to the
corresponding carboxylic acid, hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring
at different positions, and aromatic hydroxylation in rats [1122]. o-

concluded that the present exposure to estragole from spices and
added as such, does not pose a significant cancer risk [1134]. this
conclusion was based on evidence of a nonlinear relationship between dose and profiles of metabolism, metabolic activation, and
covalent binding of estragole to proteins and dna [1134].

4.3.1. alkenylbenzenes

the metabolic activation of methyleugenol is similar to that for
estragole. human cyp1a2 and cyp2c9 are the major enzymes
responsible for conversion of methyleugenol to 1’hydroxymethyleugenol, with cyp2d6 and 2c19 being lesser important for 1’-hydroxylation of methyleugenol [1135, 1136]. methyleugenol, 1’-hydroxymethyleugenol and methyleugenol-2’,3’oxide induce unscheduled dna synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes [1137], which is correlated with carcinogenicity in rodents
[1138, 1139]. in addition, methyleugenol has been shown to form
adducts with dna and protein in human fibroblasts v79 cells
transfected with human genes expressing sulfotransferases and in
the mouse liver in vivo [1140]. the adduct formation with methyleugenol (72.7 pmol/mg dna) was higher than that induced by
estragole (30.0 pmol/mg dna) or safrole (14.7 pmol/mg dna)
[1140]. this order is in line with the relative differences in doses
needed to induce tumors in animal studies, known to be in the order
of safrole > estragole > methyleugenol [1141]. animal studies indicate that methyleugenol and its proximate carcinogenic metabolite
1’-hydroxymethyleugenol induce liver tumors in mice and rats
[1141]. in addition, especially at higher doses, both compounds
induce neuroendocrine tumors of the glandular stomach, and renal
tube hyperplasia and adenomas [1139, 1141].

alkenylbenzenes include simple compounds like safrole, methyleugenol, and estragole, which are present in herbal medicines
such as nutmeg, cinnamon, tarragon, basil, fennel, and anise. they
are used as a constituent of various food flavours, aromatic oils,
spices, perfumes, and detergents. safrole is a natural constituent of
a number of spices, such as nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, anise, black
pepper, and sweet basil. it is also present in cola drinks. estragole
occurs naturally in a variety of essential oils including tarragon
(60–70% of essential oil), basil (20–43% of essential oil), fennel
(5–20% of essential oil), anise vert (1% of essential oil), and anise
star (5–6% of essential oil) [1127-1131]. several foods including
alcoholic beverages, canned fish, and fats and oils contain estragole
up to 100, 50, and 250 mg/kg, respectively [1127]. methyleugenol
is a natural ingredient of a number of herbal plants, including nutmeg, tarragon, basil, anise, lemongrass, fennel, and pimento [11271130]. the compound is also used as a flavouring agent in jellies,
baked goods, nonalcoholic beverages, chewing gums, relish, and
ice cream, and as a fragrance in several cosmetic products and cigarettes [1127]. there is considerable interest in the safety of estragole, methyleugenol and safrole, as such compounds have been
shown to be hepatocarcinogens in rodents [1132, 1133]. the scientific committee on food of the european union has concluded that
estragole is genotoxic and carcinogenic, and this will result in restrictions in the use of this compound as a food additive in the
european union. in contrary, the expert panel of the flavor and
extract manufacturers’ association (fema) of the united states

safrole was the first of alkenylbenzene compounds shown to
have carcinogenic properties [1142]. chronic administration of
safrole in the diet at 0.5–1.0% for a year or longer caused liver tumors in mice and rats [1141, 1143, 1144]. the main metabolic
pathways are allylic hydroxylation to 1’-hydroxysafrole and oxidation and o-dealkylation, the latter leading to formation of 4allylcatechol that is easily oxidized to 4-allyl-o-quinone (fig.
(145)), and epoxidation of the allylic side chain or the aromatic
ring. the oxidation of 4-allylcatechol to 4-allyl-o-quinone represents an alternative pathway to generate an electrophilic toxic metabolite [1145]. the enzymes involved in the bioactivation of safrole to 1’-hydroxysafrole in human are  xxxg582xxx , 2c9, 2d6, and
 xxxd851xxx  [1146, 1147]. 1’-hydroxysafrole and 4-allylcatechol are the
main metabolites in rodents and humans. 1’-hydroxysafrole is further conjugated by sults, giving rise to a conjugate that can easily
decompose resulting in the ultimate carcinogenic carbocation
[1148]. safrole-dna adducts were identified in the livers of mice
given cola beverages instead of drinking water [1149], or safrole
[1150]. these dna adducts are also detected in human peripheral
blood [1151] and tissues from esophageal cancer patients [1152].
1’-hydroxysafrole, safrole-2’,3’-oxide and 1’-hydroxysafrole-2’,3’oxide are detectable in patients who took a large amounts of nutmeg
[1153]. the carcinogenicity of 1’-hydroxysafrole, safrole-2’,3’oxide and 1’-hydroxysafrole-2’,3’-oxide is clearly demonstrated in
rodents [1141, 1143].

sauer et al. (2008a) [1123] have recently investigated the cyps
involved in the formation of the common metabolite pchpa from
both pcepa and pcmpa using insect cell microsomes with
cdna-expressed human cyps and human liver microsomes.
 xxxg583xxx , 2c19, 2d6, and 3a4 catalyzed pcepa o-deethylation,
and  xxxg583xxx , 2c19, and 2d6 catalyzed pcmpa o-demethylation.
according to the relative activity factor approach, these enzymes
accounted for 22, 3, 30, and 45% of the net clearance for pcepa
and 51, 8, and 40% of the net clearance for pcmpa, respectively
[1123]. the formation of pchpa in liver microsomes from
cyp2d6 poor metabolizers was reduced by 73 and 25% (1 and 10
m pcepa) and 40 and 38% (1 and 10 m pcmpa), respectively,
as compared to pooled human liver microsomes.

and kempferide are metabolized by  xxxg575xxx , 1a2 and 2c9 (fig.

1a2.
4.3.3. limonene
the r- and s-limonene enantiomers (p-mentha-1,8-diene),
monocyclic monoterpenes, are rich in orange peels and other plants,
which are used as fragrances in household products and components of artificial essential oils. the r-limonene is more abundant in
these plants than the s-isomer [1155, 1156]. s-limonene has chemopreventive activities in rats and mice [1157]. some of the hydroxylated metabolites of r-limonene, such as sobrerol, carveol,
and uroterpenol, are more potent than the parent compound in preventing mammary tumors induced by 7,12-dimethyldibenz[a] anthracene [1157].
the biotransformation of limonene has been studied in the rat,
mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, and dog [1158-1160]. following oral
administration of r-limonene to male rabbits, kodama et al. (1974)
[1161] identified several phase i and phase ii metabolites in the
urine, including p-mentha-1,8-dien-10-ol (m1), p-menth-1-ene-8,9diol (uroterpenol, m2), perillic acid (m3), perillic acid 8,9-diol
(m4), p-mentha-1,8-dien-10-yl -d-glucuronide (m5) and 8hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-9-yl -d-glucuronide (m6). later studies in
other animal species identified five additional metabolites of dlimonene, namely, 2-hydroxy-p-menth-8-en-7-oic acid (m7), perillylglycine (m8), perillyl -d-glucuronide (m9), p-mentha-1,8-dien6-ol (carveol, m10) and p-menth-1-ene-6,8,9-triol (m11) [1158,
1159]. the main metabolite in the rat and rabbit was m4; the major
metabolite in hamsters, dogs and guinea pigs was m9, m2, and m6,
respectively [1158, 1159]. m2 (uroterpenol) was the major urinary
metabolite in humans. in humans, dihydroperillic acid (m4) and
perillic acid (m3) were identified as the major plasma metabolites,
while their respective methyl esters and limonene-1,2-diol were
minor products [1162]. interestingly, r-limonene did not induce
cyps but induces phase ii enzymes such as  xxxg1073xxx  and ugts in rats
[1163, 1164], which may contribute to its chemopreventive activity.
cyps in liver microsomes from animal species oxidized limonene to several metabolites including 1,2- and 8,9-epoxides and
diols, carveol, and  xxxd2887xxx  (fig. (148)) [1160, 1165, 1166].
limonene enantiomers were oxidized to carveol and  xxxd2887xxx 
by cyp2c11 in liver microsomes from untreated rats and by

cyp2b1 in those of phenobarbital-treated rats [1167]. in addition,
the male-specific rat cyp2c11 had higher catalytic activity for
limonene than female-specific cyp2c12.
in human liver microsomes, r- and s-trans-carveol and r- and
s- xxxd2887xxx  were formed by 6- and 7-hydroxylation, respectively, with the latter being generated more extensively [1168].
inhibition and association studies showed that r- and s-limonene
enantiomers were oxidized at both 6- and 7-positions by cyp2c9
and 2c19 in human liver microsomes [1167]. recombinant
 xxxg586xxx , 2c9, 2c18, 2c19, and 3a4 expressed in trichoplusia ni
cells catalyzed oxidations of r- and s-limonene enantiomers to
respective carveol and  xxxd2887xxx , with cyp2c19 being the
most efficient catalyst followed by 2c9, 3a4 and 2c8. in contrast,
recombinant human  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, 1b1,  xxxd577xxx , 2b6, and  xxxd851xxx 
showed very low activities toward limonene [1167]. due to the role
of cyp2c9 in the disposition of limonene, polymorphism or induction/inhibition of this enzyme would alter the clearance of limonene.
4.4. environmental compounds
4.4.1. benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p)
cyp2c9 is involved in the metabolism of the procarcinogenic
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p), although
 xxxg575xxx /1a2 are the major enzymes responsible for its bioactivation [1169]. in the presence of epoxide hydrolase,  xxxg575xxx /1a2
and 1b1 catalyze the conversion of b[a]p to its 7,8-epoxide and
consequently to 7,8-dihydrodiol, and both enzymes can in turn metabolically activate this b[a]p metabolite to an ultimate mutagenic
species, the dihydrodiol epoxide (7r,8s)-dihydroxy-(9s,10r)epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (fig. (149)) [1170,
1171]. the first step for the bioactivation of b[a]p is the formation
of b[a]p 7,8-oxide catalyzed by  xxxg575xxx /1a2 and 1b1. the second step, catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase, is the hydrolytic conversion of 7,8-oxide to 7,8-diol. finally,  xxxg575xxx /2 and 1b1 catalyze
the further oxidation of the 7,8-diol, producing four possible isomers of 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide. quantitatively, the most important
of these metabolites is (7r,8s)-dihydroxy-(9s,10r)-epoxy-7,8,9,10tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene which is the ultimate carcinogen binding
dna at the guanine residues and producing dna adducts. the
dna binding will activate the h-ras and  xxxg1285xxx  oncogenes [11721175] and other oncogenes such as c-jun, e6 and e7 [1176-1179].
b[a]p 7,8-dihydrodiol is a bay-region diolepoxide that can be reduced to catechol which is further oxidized to generate a reactive
quinine metabolite. 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide can be conjugated by

fig. (148). metabolism of limonene by cyp2c9, 2c19 and 3a4. after oral administration of r-limonene to rabbits, several metabolites in the urine have been
identified, including p-mentha-1,8-dien-10-ol (m1), p-menth-1-ene-8,9-diol (uroterpenol/m2), perillic acid (m3), perillic acid 8,9-diol (m4), p-mentha-1,8dien-10-yl -d-glucuronide (m5) and 8-hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-9-yl -d-glucuronide (m6). studies in other animal species have identified five additional
metabolites of d-limonene, namely, 2-hydroxy-p-menth-8-en-7-oic acid (m7), perillylglycine (m8), perillyl -d-glucuronide (m9), p-mentha-1,8-dien-6-ol
(carveol, m10) and p-menth-1-ene-6,8,9-triol (m11). m2 (uroterpenol) is the major urinary metabolite in humans, whereas dihydroperillic acid (m4) and perillic acid (m3) are the major plasma metabolites. r- and s-limonene enantiomers are oxidized at 6- and 7-positions by cyp2c9 and 2c19 in human liver microsomes. recombinant  xxxg586xxx , 2c9, 2c18, 2c19, and 3a4 catalyze oxidation of r- and s-limonene enantiomers to respective carveols and  xxxd2887xxx .

phase ii enzymes, resulting non-toxic glucuronides and sulfates.
alternatively, b[a]p undergoes oxidation to form 4,5-oxide. on the
other hand, a one-electron oxidation pathway may be responsible
for the formation of 3- and 6-hydroxy-b[a]p and subsequent metabolites 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-quinones [1180, 1181]. the 3hydroxylation of b[a]p is catalyzed by cyp1a2, 2c8, 2c9 and
3a4 [1181]. as such,  xxxg575xxx /2 can convert pahs to reactive
electrophiles that can cause damage of macromolecules such as
dna and functional proteins, producing carcinogenic transformation of the cells.
4.4.2. dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (db[a,h]a)
db[a,h]a is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that induces
cancer in mice and rats [1182-1185]. it is bioactivated to the proxi-

mate carcinogen 3,4-dihydrodiol and subsequently to the ultimate
carcinogen 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxides (fig. (150)), which can covalently
bind to cellular macromolecules [1186, 1187]. the 1,2- and 5,6dihydrodiols had no tumor-initiating activity. in human liver microsomes, three dihydrodiols, three phenols, and one diphenol were
formed from db[a,h]a [1188]. of all recombinant cyps tested,
1a2 and 2c9 were the most active and 2b6 was moderately active
toward db[a,h]a (2.5- to 12-fold greater activity than that for other
cyps). the trans-3,4-dihydrodiol, generally recognized as a precursor of the ultimate carcinogenic 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxides, was generated most actively by cyp2c9, followed by 1a2 and 2b6 [1188].
cyp1a2 showed the highest activity toward formation of the 1,2dihydrodiol, which is considered to be a weakly carcinogenic metabolite.

fig. (149). metabolic activation of benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p) by  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, 1b1 and 2c9. b[a]p is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that is mutagenic and
highly carcinogenic; it is found in coal tar, automobile exhaust fumes, tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke, wood smoke, and in charbroiled food. the first step
of b[a]p activation is the formation of b[a]p 7, 8-oxide catalyzed by  xxxg575xxx , 1a2 and 1b1. the second step, catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase, is the hydrolysis of b[a]p 7, 8-oxide to its trans-7, 8-dihydrodiol. finally,  xxxg575xxx /2 and 1b1 catalyze the further oxidation of b[a]p 7,8-dihydrodiol, resulting in four
possible isomers of 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide. alternatively, b[a]p 7, 8-oxide can be detoxified by glutathione conjugation. the most important of these isomers
is (7r, 8s)-dihydroxy-(9s, 10r)-epoxy-7, 8, 9, 10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene which is the ultimate carcinogen binding dna at the guanine residues and producing dna adducts. the binding of dna will activate h-ras and other oncogenes such e6 and e7 and lead to carcinogenesis. b[a]p 7, 8-dihydrodiol is a
bay-region diolepoxide that can be reduced to catechol which is further oxidized to generate a reactive quinine metabolite. 7, 8-diol-9, 10-epoxide can be
conjugated by phase ii enzymes, resulting non-toxic glucuronides and sulfates. b[a]p also undergoes oxidation to form 4, 5-oxide. moreover, b[a]p is converted by cyp1a2, 2c8, 2c9 and 3a4 to 3- and/or 6-hydroxy-b[a]p and subsequent metabolites 1, 6-, 3, 6-, and 6, 12-quinones.

4.4.3.  xxxd2143xxx 
cyp2c9, 1a2 and other cyps are involved in the metabolism
of  xxxd2143xxx  [1189], a synthetic organochlorine and 1,1-bis(pchlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane substitute preferred as an insecticide because of its low toxicity and limited and short persistence
in the biological systems.  xxxd2143xxx  is one of a few organochlorine pesticides that have seen an increase in use since the ban on
ddt in 1972.  xxxd2143xxx  as an endocrine disruptor elicits broad
endocrine toxicities related to its estrogen-like behavior including
adverse developmental, reproductive, and behavioral effects [1190].
 xxxd2143xxx  may induce endocrine cancers in rodents [1191].
 xxxd2143xxx  is carcinogenic for the testis of mice and the ovary of
rats, but it is not considered to be carcinogenic or teratogenic to
humans. human liver microsomes catalyze primarily mono-odemethylation of this insecticide, and secondary and tertiary metabolism occurs during longer incubation periods, resulting in a
second demethylation and ortho-hydroxylation (fig. (151)) [1189].

there is low level metabolism to other ortho-hydroxylated metabolites and this may occur without prior o-demethylation. in addition,
 xxxd2143xxx  undergoes activation to a reactive metabolite of unknown structure that binds covalently to microsomal protein [1192].
both the mono- (i.e. mono-oh- xxxd2143xxx ) and bisdemethylated metabolites [i.e. (2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)- 1,1,1trichloroethane), hpte] of  xxxd2143xxx  exhibit estrogenic activity
in vitro and reproductive toxicity, whereas the parent compound is
essentially inactive [1193]. incubation of  xxxd2143xxx  with microsomes from insect cells over-expressing cyp1a2, 2c18, or 2c19
yielded mono-oh- xxxd2143xxx ; incubation with purified
cyp2c19 and 2c18 resulted in mono-oh- xxxd2143xxx  and the
bis-demethylated metabolite as well [1189]. cyp2c19 appears to be
the major catalyst of  xxxd2143xxx  mono-o-demethylation. however, in individuals lacking functional cyp2c19, cyp1a2 may
play the predominant role.  xxxg582xxx , 2c9, 2c18, and  xxxg583xxx 
probably contribute to a less extent.

subsequently to the ultimate carcinogen 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxides which can covalently bind to cellular macromolecules. in human liver microsomes, three dihydrodiols, three phenols, and one diphenol were formed from db[a,h]a. of all recombinant cyps tested, 1a2 and 2c9 were the most active and 2b6 was moderately active toward db[a,h]a. the trans-3,4-dihydrodiol, generally recognized as a precursor of the ultimate carcinogenic 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxides, was generated most actively by cyp2c9, followed by 1a2 and 2b6.

4.4.4. phosphorus-containing thioether pesticides
a variety of pesticides including thioether-containing organophosphorus and carbamate compounds are generally oxidated and
detoxified by cyps and fmos [1194, 1195]. usmani et al. (2004)
[1196] examined the sulfoxidation of four thioether compounds
including phorate, disulfoton, sulprofos and methiocarb. cyps were
found to be the predominant enzymes responsible for the conversion of thioether compounds to sulfoxides compared with fmos
using selective inhibitors. in the presence of 1-benzylimidizole (a
non-selective cyp inhibitor) decreased the sulfoxidation by 85 to
89%, whilst the heat treatment to inactivate the fmos present in
human liver microsomes led to slight inhibition of the oxidation of
these thioether compounds, ranging from 9 to 15% [1196]. the
conversion of phorate to phorate sulfoxide was carried out by
cyp1a2, 3a4, 2b6, 2c9, 2c18, 2c19, 2d6 and fmo1 (fig.
(152)); disulfoton was metabolized via sulfoxidation by cyp1a2,
3a4, 2b6, 2c18, 2c19, 2d6 and fmo1. sulprofos sulfoxide was
produced by  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, 3a4, 3a5, 2c9, 2c18, 2c19, 2d6 and
fmo1;  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, 3a4, 2b6, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6, and fmo1
catalyzed methiocarb sulfoxidation (fig. (152)). these thioether

pesticides are all neutral compounds and are thus atypical substrates
for cyp2c9 which prefers acidic compounds.
4.4.5. pyrethroid pesticides
pyrethroids, with relatively low mammalian toxicity, are synthetic insecticides structurally based on the pyrethrins which are
botanical insecticides [1197]. these pesticides are widely used in
agriculture and as medical and veterinary products. the basic pyrethroid structure consists of an acid and alcohol moiety. type  pyrethroids (e.g. bifenthrin) are esters of primary or secondary alcohols
and type  pyrethroids (e.g. esfenvalerate and deltamethrin) are
esters of secondary alcohols with a cyano group at the carbon of
the alcohol moiety. pyrethroids are mainly metabolized by ester
hydrolysis, with cyp-dependent oxidation at 4’-position being less
important [1197].
in human liver microsomes, esfenvalerate was metabolized
mainly through nadph-dependent oxidation, while deltamethrin
was primarily degraded by carboxyesterase (ce)-mediated hydrolysis [1198]. human  xxxg430xxx  was more active for deltamethrin than the
class 1 rat ces hydrolases a and b and the class 2 human ce-2, but

as a commonly used herbicide but with broad endocrine toxicities related to its estrogen-like behavior. human liver microsomes catalyze primarily mono-odemethylation of this insecticide. secondary and tertiary metabolism occurs during longer incubation periods, resulting in a second demethylation and orthohydroxylation. there is low level metabolism to other ortho-hydroxylated metabolites and this may occur without prior o-demethylation. in addition,  xxxd2143xxx  undergoes activation to a reactive metabolite of unknown structure that binds covalently to microsomal protein. incubation of  xxxd2143xxx  with microsomes from insect cells overexpressing cyp1a2, 2c18, or 2c19 yielded mono-oh- xxxd2143xxx ; incubation with purified cyp2c19 and 2c18 resulted in
mono-oh- xxxd2143xxx  and the bis-demethylated metabolite as well. cyp2c19 appears to be the major catalyst of  xxxd2143xxx  mono-o-demethylation.
however, in individuals lacking functional cyp2c19, cyp1a2 may play the predominant role.  xxxg582xxx , 2c9, 2c18, and probably 2b6 contribute to a lesser
extent.

3-phenoxybenozoic acid

fig. (153). metabolism of the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin. deltamethrin has been found to be metabolized by ester hydrolysis and oxidation at the 4’position of the terminal aromatic ring. the ester hydrolysis of deltamethrin yielded cis-dibromochrysanthemic acid and a cyanohydrin that would spontaneously
convert to 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde. the later underwent a redox reaction to result in 3-phenoxybenozoid acid and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, probably catalyzed
by cytosolic adhs and aldhs. recombinant  xxxg586xxx , 2c19, 3a4, 3a5, but not 2c9, metabolized deltamethrin, probably at 4’-position. however, cyp1a2,
 xxxd577xxx , 2b6,  xxxd851xxx  and 2d6 did not metabolize this pesticide. 3-phenoxybenozoic acid is further conjugated to form sulfated, glucuronidated and glycine conjugates which are excreted into the excreta.

rat hydrolase a hydrolyzed esfenvalerate 2-fold faster than human
 xxxg430xxx . however, both esfenvalerate and deltamethrin were not metabolized by human serum or human serum esterases. deltamethrin
has been found to be metabolized by ester hydrolysis and oxidation
at the 4’-position of the terminal aromatic ring (fig. (153)) [1199].
the ester hydrolysis of deltamethrin yielded cis-dibromochrysanthemic acid and a cyanohydrin that would spontaneously convert to 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde. the later underwent a redox reaction to result in 3-phenoxybenozoid acid and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, probably catalyzed by cytosolic adhs and aldhs. godin et
al. (2007) [1200] revealed that recombinant  xxxg586xxx , 2c19, 3a4,
3a5, but not 2c9, metabolized deltamethrin, probably at 4’position. however, cyp1a2,  xxxd577xxx , 2b6,  xxxd851xxx  and 2d6 did not metabolize this pesticide. 3-phenoxybenozoic acid is further conjugated to form sulfates, glucuronides and glycine conjugates which
are excreted into the excreta.
similarly, esfenvalerate is subject to ester hydrolysis, liberating
2-(4-chlorophenyl)isovaleric acid and cyanohydrin which was finally converted into 3-phenoxybenozoic acid (fig. (154)). in addition, esfenvalerate can be hydroxylated at 2’- and 4’-positions.
cyp2c9, 2c8, 2c19, 3a4 and 3a5 oxidized esfenvalerate, possibly at 2’ and 4’-positions [1200]. in addition, 2-(4-chlorophenyl)
isovaleric acid can be glucuronidated or hydroxylated at the methyl
group followed by conjugation.
scollon et al. (2009) [1201] further investigated the metabolism
of 9 pyrethroid pesticides in human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes. the pyrethroids studied included bifenthrin, sbioallethrin, bioresmethrin, -cyfluthrin, -cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, cis-permethrin, trans-permethrin, and resmethrin (fig.

(155)). cyp2c9 (wild-type) metabolized all these pesticides except
s-bioallethrin, cypermethrin trans-permethrin. for cyp2c9.2, all
pesticides except -cyfluthrin, -cyhalothrin and cis-permethrin
were metabolized by this mutated enzyme. the mutated cyp2c9.3
only metabolized bifenthrin, -cyhalothrin and cypermethrin
[1201].  xxxg586xxx  and 2c19 metabolized all pesticides tested while
cyp3a4 metabolized most of them but bifenthrin and transpermethrin. it appears that the oxidation of pyrethroid pesticides is
catalyzed by multiple cyps including cyp2c9, 2c8, 2c19 and
3a4, but the relative contribution of these enzymes is genotypeand substrate-dependent.
4.5. endogenous compounds
4.5.1.  xxxd208xxx 
a large number of biologically active eicosanoid metabolites
are generated from  xxxd208xxx  via pathways including epoxidation, allylic oxidation, and -hydroxylation, by cyps, coxs, and
lipoxygenases [1202]. the cyp-mediated pathway generates two
biologically active classes of eicosanoids, the epoxyeicosatrienoic
 xxxd2154xxx  (eets) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  xxxd2154xxx  (hetes)
(fig. (156 )). these metabolites have important in vivo activities,
such as blood pressure regulation, inflammation, modulation of
electrolytes flux, fluid transport, smooth muscle tone regulation,
cellular proliferation, and apoptosis [1203]. olefin epoxidation of
 xxxd208xxx  forms four regio-isomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids existing as either the r,s- or the s,r-enantiomers (i.e. 5,6-,
8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-eets) [1204]. cytosolic epoxide hydrolase
and glutathione s-transferases catalyze the conversion of eets to
vic-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, and glutathione conjugates, rex

 xxxd208xxx 

(156). metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  by cyp1, 2, 3 and 4 families. a large number of biologically active eicosanoid metabolites are generated from
 xxxd208xxx  via pathways including epoxidation, allylic oxidation, and -hydroxylation, by cyps, coxs, and lipoxygenases. the cyp-mediated pathway
generates two biologically active classes of eicosanoids, the eets and hetes. olefin epoxidation of  xxxd208xxx  forms four regio-isomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids existing as either the r, s- or the s, r-enantiomers (i.e. 5, 6-, 8, 9-, 11, 12- and 14, 15-eets). cytosolic epoxide hydrolase and gsh transferases
catalyze the conversion of eets to vic-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, and gsh conjugates, respectively. the hetes can be subdivided into -terminal (i.e.
hydroxylation of carbons near or at the  end, e.g. 16, 17-, 18-, 19-, and 20-hete, namely -4, -3, -2, -1 and -alcohols, respectively), midchain (to form
six regio-isomeric hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids containing a cis, trans-conjugated  xxxd1878xxx  functionality, e.g. 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12, -and 15-hetes), and bis-allylic
(lipoxygenase-like reaction) hydroxylation (e.g. 7-, 10- and 13-hetes). cyp2s primarily metabolize  xxxd208xxx  to eets via epoxydation. cyp2c9 formed
12r-, 13- and 19-hetes, whereas  xxxg586xxx  formed 10-, 11-, 13-, 15- and 19-hetes as main metabolites.  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 also converted  xxxd208xxx  to
relatively large amounts of cis-trans conjugated hetes via midchain hydroxylation with double bond migration. cyp2c19 formed 19-hete as the prominent
metabolite with relatively little production of bis-allylic hydroxy metabolites and other hetes. this enzyme also formed epoxides/diols as major metabolites.

spectively [1205, 1206]. the hetes can be subdivided into terminal (i.e. hydroxylations of carbons near or at the  end, e.g.
16, 17-, 18-, 19-, and 20-hete, namely -4, -3, -2, -1 and alcohols, respectively), midchain (to form six regioisomeric hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids containing a cis, trans-conjugated  xxxd1878xxx  functionality, e.g. 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12- and 15-hetes), and bisallylic (lipoxygenase-like reaction) hydroxylations (e.g. 7-, 10- and
13-hetes) [1207]. 7-, 10- and 13-hetes are acid labile and decompose to cis-trans conjugated dienols nonenzymatically [1208].
hydroxylation with double bond migration leads to enzymatic biosynthesis of cis-trans conjugated hydroxy  xxxd2154xxx .

 xxxg575xxx , 1b1 and 1a2 generate hetes and eets from  xxxd208xxx  as the major products [1209, 1210]. the major metabolites of  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, and 1b1 were 75% terminal hetes,
52% eets, and 54% mid-chain hetes, respectively [1210].
cyp1a2 could convert  xxxd208xxx  to 7-, 10- and 13-hetes
[1211]. cyp2s primarily metabolize  xxxd208xxx  to eets via epoxydation [1212-1219]. cyp2c9 formed 12r-, 13- and 19-hetes,
whereas  xxxg586xxx  formed 10-, 11-, 13-, 15- and 19-hetes as main
metabolites [1211].  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 also converted arachidonic
acid to relatively large amounts of cis-trans conjugated hetes via
midchain hydroxylation with double bond migration [1209].

fig. (157). metabolism of  xxxd2263xxx . 6-hydroxylation and o-demethylation of  xxxd2263xxx , followed by glucuronidation and sulfation, are considered major detoxification processes for  xxxd2263xxx . hydroxylation could also occur at the 3- or 4-position of  xxxd2263xxx . hydroxyl -carboline metabolite such as harmol is readily
conjugated through glucuronidation and sulfation.  xxxd2263xxx  is mainly metabolized via o-demethylation by cyp2d6, with contribution from  xxxg575xxx , 1a2,
2c9 and 2c19.

cyp2c19 formed 19-hete as the prominent metabolite with relatively little production of bis-allylic hydroxy metabolites and other
hetes [1211]. this enzyme also formed epoxides/diols as major
metabolites. cyp2j2 has been identified as an organ specific epoxygenase [1213, 1220]. cyp2w1 converted  xxxd208xxx  to
the 8,9-, the 11,12-, and the 14,15-epoxides [1221]. however,
 xxxg589xxx  differs in that its metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  generates
90% hetes (e.g. 18- and 19-hetes) by -1, -2 and -3 hydroxylation [1209].  xxxg1812xxx  members have been reported to primarily
catalyze /-1 hydroxylation to form hetes [1209] or hetes via
midchain hydroxylation [1211]. cyp3a4 converted arachidonic
acid to 7-, 10- and 13-hetes [1211]. in addition, cyp4s are the
predominant fatty acid /-1 hydroxylases in most mammalian
tissues, resulting in 16, 17-, 18-, 19- and 20-hetes [1222-1224].
cyp4 subfamily is composed of a group of highly conserved genes
coding for proteins that are specialized for fatty acid oxidation and
with little or no activity towards the metabolism of most xenobiotics.  xxxg594xxx  and 4f2 form 20-hete [1222].
4.5.2.  -carbolines
 xxxg575xxx  and 1a2 catalyzed the o-demethylation of harmaline
and  xxxd2263xxx  [1225], two psychotropic -carboline alkaloids formed
endogenously from tryptophan-derived indolealkylamines through
the pictet-spengler condensation with aldehydes present in both
plants and mammals.  xxxd2263xxx  has two major oxidative pathways:
o-demethylation and 6-hydroxylation (fig. (157)). hydroxylation
could also occur at the 3- or 4-position of  xxxd2263xxx  [1226]. hydroxyl -carboline metabolites such as harmol are readily conjugated through glucuronidation and sulfation. the psychotropic carboline alkaloids harmaline and  xxxd2263xxx  are mainly metabolized
via o-demethylation by cyp2d6, with contribution from  xxxg575xxx ,
1a2, 2c9 and 2c19 [1225].

linoleic acid (18:2n-6) is a polyunsaturated -6 fatty acid used
in the biosynthesis of  xxxd208xxx  and thus some prostaglandins [1227]. it is found in the lipids of cell membranes and is abundant in many vegetable oils (e.g. sunflower oil). multiple oxidative
pathways for linoleic acid have been identified (fig. (158)). linoleic acid is converted into -linoleic acid by 6-desaturase; linoleic acid is then converted to dihomo--linoleic acid, which in
turn is converted to  xxxd208xxx  from which prostaglandins,

thromboxanes, and leukotrienes are synthesized [1227]. multiple
cyps have been shown to catalyze 9,10- and 12,13-epoxidation,
bisallylic hydroxylation, and  and -1 hydroxylation [1211].
cyp1a2, 2c8, 2c9, 2c19 and 3a4 converted linoleic acid to 11hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (11-hode) [1211]. 11-hode is acid
labile and decomposes to cis-trans conjugated  xxxd1878xxx  nonenzymatically. linoleic acid was also converted to  xxxd598xxx  and 13hode with 80% to 82% r stereochemistry by initial hydrogen
abstraction at c11 with subsequent double bond migration and oxidation at c9 or c13. 17-hode and 18-hode and monoepoxides
were also formed by cyp2c9 and 2c19. cyp2c9 is the major
catalyst for linoleic acid epoxygenation, and the major products are
leukotoxin (9,10-epoxy-12- xxxd3244xxx ) and isoleukotoxin
(12,13-epoxy- xxxd2777xxx ) [1228]. both leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin are metabolized primarily by the soluble epoxide hydrolase
3 to their respective diols [1229]. in addition, linoleic acid is an
inhibitor of cyp2c9 with ic50 of 7.72 m [1230].
4.5.4. melatonin
melatonin is the principal  xxxd2559xxx  synthesized from
tryptophan and secreted by the pineal gland during the dark period
and its physiological roles in humans are to embrace diurnal
rhythm, sleep, mood, immunity, reproduction, intestinal motility,
and metabolism [1231, 1232]. melatonin has been shown to possess
antioxidant, neuro-protective, cardio-protective, and anticancer
properties [1231-1233]. melatonin has been evaluated as a therapeutic agent in a number of conditions, including sleep disturbance,
jet lag, parkinson’s disease, depression, epilepsy, dementia, and
metastatic cancer [1234-1238]. these effects are considered to be
mediated by three specific melatonin receptor subtypes, namely
mt1, mt2, and the putative mt3 binding site [1231, 1232]. melatonin is mainly metabolized by 6-hydroxylation, with odemethylation being a relatively minor pathway (fig. (159)). the
resulting 6-hydroxymelatonin and  xxxd70xxx 
( xxxd70xxx ) are excreted in urine as their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates [1239, 1240].  xxxg575xxx  [1241], 1b1 [1242], 1a2
[1241-1247], 2c9 [1248], and 2c19 [1246-1248] all contribute to
the metabolism of melatonin. cyp1a2 is the major enzyme for
melatonin 6-hydroxylation, with contribution from  xxxg575xxx  and
2c19 [1242]. melatonin o-demethylation to produce nacetylserotonin is mainly catalyzed by cyp2c19, with small contribution from cyp1a2 [1242]. both 6-oh-melatonin and n-

by cyp2c9 and 2c19. cyp2c9 is the major catalyst for linoleic acid epoxygenation, and the major products are leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin.

minor metabolic pathway of melatonin is deacetylation to 5methoxytryptamine, which can be further metabolized to pinoline,
bufotenine,  xxxd2686xxx .
4.5.5. retinoids
 xxxg575xxx  and 1a2 are involved in the metabolism of retinoids
(fig. (160)). retinoids are naturally occurring and synthetic analogues of  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol) that play a key role in the regulation of
a variety of important physiologic processes including growth, embryogenesis, vision, reproduction, epithelial cell differentiation,
homeostasis, and immune function [1249]. they have been used in
the prevention and the treatment of certain types of cancer. retinol

( xxxd3105xxx ) is the major retinoid absorbed after complex metabolic
reactions in the intestines, and is stored in esterified form in the
liver [1250]. after ester hydrolysis, retinol is then transported by a
plasma retinol binding protein to the tissues where it can exert its
activity. a small fraction of the plasma retinoids is available in the
form of  xxxd3417xxx  bound to albumin, which is rapidly
taken up by tissues.  xxxd3417xxx  is considered the active
form of  xxxd3105xxx  and is involved in gene regulation, leading to
differentiation and apoptosis of normal and cancer cells. the conversion of retinol to retinal by the cyps is considered to be the ratelimiting step for the biosynthesis of  xxxd3417xxx  [1250].

1b1, 2c9, and 2c19 all contribute to the metabolism of melatonin. cyp1a2 is the major enzyme for melatonin 6-hydroxylation, with contribution from
 xxxg575xxx  and 2c19. melatonin o-demethylation to produce  xxxd70xxx  is mainly catalyzed by cyp2c19, with small contribution from cyp1a2. both
6-oh-melatonin and  xxxd70xxx  can be conjugated to sulfates and glucuronides. a minor metabolic pathway of melatonin is deacetylation to 5methoxytryptamine, which can be further metabolized to pinoline, bufotenine, n, n-dimethyltryptamine.

retinal and, subsequently, to  xxxd3417xxx .  xxxg575xxx , 1b1, 1a2, and
3a4 are responsible for the conversion of all- xxxd3105xxx  to alltrans-retinal [1251, 1252].  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, and 1b1 showed considerable ability to oxidize all-trans-retinal to  xxxd3417xxx  [1210,
1251, 1252]. retinoid aldh also catalyzed this reaction. intracellular isomerases may further convert  xxxd3417xxx  to 9-cis, 11-cis-, or 13-cis-retinoid acid. degradation of  xxxd3417xxx  is
mainly catalysed by cyp26 which can protect the tissues from
excessive  xxxd3417xxx . cyp26 catalyzed 4-oh-, 4-oxo-, and 5,6epoxy- xxxd3417xxx  formation [1253].  xxxg583xxx , 2c8, 3a4/5, and
 xxxd577xxx  were involved in the formation of 4-oh and 4-oxo-retinoic
acid in human liver microsomes [1254, 1255]. 4-oh- xxxd3417xxx 
was formed by recombinant  xxxg593xxx , 3a5, 2c18, 2c8, 3a4 and
2c9, whereas the 18-oh- xxxd3417xxx  formation involved
 xxxg594xxx , 3a7, 1a1, 2c9, 2c8, 3a5, 3a4 and 2c18 [1255].
 xxxg586xxx , 2c9, and 1a1 play a major role in the catabolism of  xxxd3417xxx  to 4-hydroxy-, 4-oxo-, and 18-hydroxy-retinoica cid.
cyp2s1 also converted  xxxd3417xxx  to the 4-hydroxy and
5,6-epoxide products [1256]. these hydroxylated derivatives are

metabolized to other polar retinoid metabolites. ugt2b7 can glucuronide 4-oh- xxxd3417xxx  [1257]. most effects of  xxxd3105xxx  are
attributable to its active metabolites such as  xxxd3417xxx ,
9- xxxd2404xxx , and all-trans-4-oxo- xxxd3417xxx  that can bind
the nuclear receptors called  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) and retinoid x receptors (rxrs), each comprising three subtypes (, ,
and ) [1258, 1259]. the rars, which function as ligand-inducible
transcriptional regulators, heterodimerize with rxr and are activated by both  xxxd3417xxx  and 9- xxxd2404xxx .
4.5.6. steroids
multiple cyps are involved in the metabolism of endogenous
and synthetic steroids. individual cyps have the ability to hydroxylate these steroids with a high degree of stereo-specificity and regioselectivity. cyp2c9 participates in the oxidation of several endogenous compounds such as progesterone [1260], testosterone
[1260],  xxxd3417xxx  [1255], and 17- xxxd2054xxx 
[1261, 1262].

progesterone is a 21-carbon steroid hormone involved in the
female menstrual cycle, pregnancy and embryogenesis of humans.
progesterone is produced in the adrenal glands, the gonads, brain,
and placenta. progesterone, like all other steroids, is synthesized
from pregnenolone (a derivative of cholesterol) via two steps: the 3hydroxyl group is converted to a keto group and then the double
bond is moved to c4, from c5. progesterone is the precursor of the
mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and after conversion to 17hydroxyprogesterone (another natural progestogen) of cortisol and
androstenedione [1263]. the latter can be converted to testosterone,
estrone and estradiol. in human liver microsomes, progesterone is
converted to 2-, 2-, 6-, 6-, 7, 15-, 16-, 17- and 21hydroxyprogesterone [1264]. cyp2c9 catalyzed progesterone 21hydroxylation, although the activity was lower than that catalyzed
by cyp2c19 (fig. (161)) [1260]. the vmax/km ratio for the progesterone 21-hydroxylation by cyp2c19 was determined to be 13and 32-fold higher than those of cyp2c9 and 3a4, respectively.
cyp3a4 converted progesterone to16-, 6-, and 2- xxxd2303xxx  as major metabolites and 21- xxxd2303xxx  as a
minor product, but did not form significant level of 17 xxxd2303xxx  [1260]. recombinant cyp2c19 catalyzed
progesterone to form 21- xxxd2303xxx  as a major metabolite
and 16- and 17- xxxd2303xxx  as minor products [1260].

testosterone plays a key role in developing and maintaining
masculine sexual organ, and promotes secondary sexual characteristics, including the appearance of facial hair, sexual desire, and
sexual behavior. testosterone is synthesized from pregnenolone
which is a steroid precursor to cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone
(dhea), progesterone, and testosterone [1265]. -hydroxylation at
either the c6 or c16 position is the major route of testosterone oxidative metabolism, whereas 1-, 2/-, 11- and 15hydroxytestosterone are formed as minor metabolites (fig. (162)).
testosterone 6-hydroxylation is catalyzed by cyp3a4 and
 xxxg592xxx , and this accounts for 75 to 80% of all metabolites formed
[1266]. testosterone 6-hydroxylation has been used as a marker
reaction. small amounts of 15- and 2-hydroxytestosterone were
also detected in vitro [1267]. 11-hydroxylation was catalyzed by
cyp3a4, 2c9 and 2c19 [1268]. both cyp2c9 and 2c19 oxidized
testosterone at 17-position to form androstenedione [1260]. in some
target tissues, testosterone is 5-hydroxylated by the cytoplasmic
enzyme 5- reductase to the more potent 5-dihydrotestosterone or
estradiol by aromatization (e.g. in the bones and the brain). 5dihydrotestosterone binds with greater affinity to the androgen
receptor, while estradiol binds to the  xxxg730xxx . 5dihydrotestosterone is reversibly inactivated by 3-reduction and a
smaller amount is converted to 5- xxxd592xxx . androstenedi-

(161). hydroxylation of progesterone. in human liver microsomes, progesterone is converted to 2-, 2-, 6-, 6-, 7, 15-, 16-, 17- and 21hydroxyprogesterone. multiple human cyps are involved in the hydroxylation of progesterone. cyp3a4 showed the highest progesterone 16-hydroxylation
activity, followed by  xxxg575xxx  and 2d6, while human cyp3a4, 3a5, and 4b1 (expressed in lung but not liver) catalyzed the 6-hydroxylation of progesterone. cyp3a4 oxidized progesterone to form 16-, 6-, and 2- xxxd2303xxx  as major products and 21- xxxd2303xxx  as a minor product, but
did not produce detectable levels of 17- xxxd2303xxx . cyp2c9 showed progesterone 21-hydroxylation activities, although the activities were lower
than those catalyzed by cyp2c19. cyp2c19 catalyzed progesterone to form 21- xxxd2303xxx  as a major product and 16- and 17 xxxd2303xxx  as minor products. in addition, human cyp2d6 and rat cyp2d4 are the predominant cyp2ds in the brain and exhibit 21-hydroxylation
activity toward progesterone and its hydroxylated metabolite 17- xxxd2303xxx .

one and dhea are metabolized to testosterone by 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. androstenedione may be metabolized to
androsterone or  xxxd2064xxx  which can be conjugated and excreted. most androgens are conjugated prior to excretion in the
urine. testosterone and androstenedione are cleared three times
more rapidly in men than women.

 xxxd1849xxx  sulfate
glucuronide

fig. (164). metabolism of  xxxd1849xxx .  xxxd1849xxx  requires bioactivation to  xxxd2067xxx  ( xxxd2067xxx ) to exert its desired biological effect that is much
stronger than that of the parent compound.  xxxd2067xxx  is the major compound present in plasma at least up to 24 hr after administration of drug. after
this oral administration,  xxxd1849xxx  was extensively metabolized. in healthy women, the dosed radioactivity was predominantly (60%) excreted via urine,
while about 35% was excreted via the feces.  xxxd1849xxx  was metabolized mainly at the c3-, c5-, c6- and c13-ch2ch3 positions. at the c3-position, the 3keto moiety was found and in addition, 3-hydroxy and 3-hydroxy groups were observed in combination with a reduced 4-double bond to form 5hydrodesogestrel. hydroxy groups were introduced at the c6- (6-oh), the c13-ethyl (c13-ch2ch2oh) and possibly the c15- (15-oh) position of
 xxxd1849xxx . conjugation of the 3-hydroxy moiety with sulfonic acid and conjugation with glucuronic acid were also major metabolic routes found for
 xxxd1849xxx  in postmenopausal women.  xxxd1849xxx  was metabolised by recombinant cyp2c9 and 2c19 to 3-hydroxydesogestrel with small amounts of 3hydroxydesogestrel also being formed.

bioactivation to  xxxd2067xxx  ( xxxd2067xxx ) to exert its desired
biological effect that is much stronger than that of the parent compound (fig. (164)) [1270].  xxxd2067xxx  is the major compound present in plasma at least up to 24 hr after administration of
drug [1271]. after this oral administration,  xxxd1849xxx  was extensively metabolized. in healthy women, the dosed radioactivity was
predominantly (60%) excreted via urine, while about 35% was
excreted via the feces [1272].  xxxd1849xxx  was metabolized mainly
at the c3-, c5-, c6- and c13-ch2ch3 positions (fig. 164). at the
c3 position, the 3-keto moiety was found and in addition, 3hydroxy and 3-hydroxy groups were observed in combination
with a reduced 4-double bond to form 5-hydrodesogestrel. hydroxy groups were introduced at the c6- (6-oh), the c13-ethyl
(c13-ch2ch2oh) and possibly the c15 (15-oh) position of
 xxxd1849xxx  [1272]. conjugation of the 3-hydroxy moiety with
sulfonic acid and conjugation with glucuronic acid were also major
metabolic routes found for  xxxd1849xxx  in postmenopausal women.
human liver microsomes mainly converted  xxxd1849xxx  to its 3-keto
metabolite [1273], and predominant positions for further hydroxylation of the 3-keto metabolite were the c6 position (6-hydroxy) and
the ethyl substituent at the c13 position [1273, 1274].  xxxd1849xxx 

was metabolised by recombinant cyp2c9 and 2c19 to 3hydroxydesogestrel with small amounts of 3-hydroxydesogestrel
also being formed [1275].
 xxxd2581xxx  is a synthetic estrogen used as a major component in
some oral contraceptives, differing from 17- xxxd2054xxx  by
the presence of a methoxy group at the 3-position. as a steroidal
prodrug,  xxxd2581xxx  must be converted to 17- xxxd2054xxx  to
exert its biological effect in vivo (fig. (165)). cyp2c9 has been
implicated as the major catalyst in the bioactivation of  xxxd2581xxx  to
17- xxxd2054xxx  [1276]. strong inhibition of  xxxd2054xxx 
formation by sulfaphenazole suggests a major contribution of
cyp2c9 to this reaction in vitro.  xxxd2581xxx  is demethylated in the
liver to form biologically active 17-ethinylestragen with a
conversion efficiency of 50%. 17-ethinylestragen undergoes
extensive metabolism by multiple cyps.
4.6. a summary
cyp2c9 is one of the most important cyps involved in drug
metabolism in humans. cyp2c9 plays a significant role in the metabolism of certain oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemics (e.g.  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2204xxx ), nsaids (e.g. diclofenac, ketopro-

and rofecoxib), diuretics (e.g.  xxxd3404xxx  and  xxxd3256xxx ),
antiepileptics (e.g. phenytoin),  xxxg99xxx  receptor inhibitors
(e.g. losartan and candesartan), and anticoagulants (e.g. sacenocoumarol and  xxxd990xxx ). for many of other drugs, cyp2c9
only plays a minor role in their overall metabolic clearance and thus
the impact of cyp2c9 polymorphisms and inhibition on their disposition and clearance is minor.

teins in primary human hepatocytes [1278-1282]. the concentration
dependence of  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 mrnas in response to rifampicin
and phenobarbital paralleled that of cyp3a4 and 2b6, the maximum accumulation being reached with rifampicin  xxxd1891xxx  m or
phenobarbital at 100 m. phenobarbital is not a potent inducer of
 xxxg586xxx  and cyp2c9 genes. the induction of cyp2c9 by rifampicin,  xxxd2307xxx , and phenobarbital was mediated by transactivation of  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) [1283].

typical substrates of cyp2c9 such as celecoxib, ibuprofen,
 xxxd2141xxx , and diclofenac are relatively small, lipophilic and
contain acidic groupings with pka values in the range 3.8–8.1
which will be ionized at physiological ph, forming anions in vivo.
the carboxylate groups of tienilic acid and diclofenac have been
shown to be responsible for substrate preference and orientation in
the active site of cyp2c9. therefore, a typical cyp2c9 substrate
should contain an anionic site and a hydrophobic site. however,
neutral or positively charged compounds may also be substrates of
cyp2c9. for example, db[a,h]a and b[a]p have been identified
as cyp2c9 substrates [1188, 1277]. unlike typical substrates of
cyp2c9, these neutral, highly hydrophobic compounds do not
contain an acidic functional group. the diversity of cyp2c9 substrates has widened with phosphorus-containing thioether pesticides
such as phorate, disulfoton, sulprofos, and methiocarb [1196].

in contrast, dexamethasone resulted in maximum induction of
 xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 mrnas at 0.1 m while cyp3a4 and 2b6 was
not induced. dexamethasone, which has been recently shown to upregulate  xxxg1598xxx  and  xxxg1599xxx  (car) expression through the  xxxg1601xxx , potentiated  xxxg586xxx  and
2c9 mrna induction in response to rifampicin and phenobarbital.
therefore,  xxxg1598xxx / xxxg1598xxx , car/ xxxg1599xxx , and  xxxg1601xxx 
(gr/ xxxg1601xxx ) are all involved in the regulation of cyp2c9. in contrast to the other cyp2c messengers,  xxxg584xxx  mrna was not
inducible in cultures human hepatocytes [1282].

5. induction of cyp2c9 and role of nuclear receptors in its regulation
5.1. prototypical inducers of cyp2c9 and role of nuclear receptors
like  xxxg586xxx , rifampicin and phenobarbital (fig. (166)) induced cyp2c9, and to a lesser extent cyp2c19 mrnas and pro-

there are two dr1 elements at –152 and –185 bp of the promoter region of the cyp2c9 gene, and hepatocyte nuclear factor4 (hnf-4/ xxxg1065xxx ) can activate the transcription of this gene via
the dr1 element in hepg2 cells [1284, 1285]. hnf-4/ xxxg1065xxx 
synergizes with car/ xxxg1599xxx  and  xxxg1598xxx / xxxg1598xxx  in hepg2 cells
treated with rifampicin when the car/ xxxg1598xxx  binding site at –1839
bp is present [1285]. mutation of the two hnf-4/ xxxg1065xxx  binding
sites differentially prevented up-regulation of cyp2c9 promoter by
both car/ xxxg1599xxx  and hnf-4/ xxxg1065xxx ; synergy between the two
receptors essentially abolished induction by rifampicin in hepg2
cells transfected with  xxxg1598xxx / xxxg1598xxx . these findings suggest that
there is cross-talk between distal car/ xxxg1598xxx  sites and  xxxg1065xxx / xxxg1065xxx  binding sites in the cyp2c9 promoter and that the

pactimibe and cp-113,818, are also shown.

hnf-4/ xxxg1065xxx  sites are required for maximal induction of the
cyp2c9 promoter.
5.2. drugs behaving as inducers of cyp2c9
5.2.1. anti-hiv drugs
ritonavir and nelfinavir modestly induced cyp2c9, 2c19 and
1a2 in cultured human hepatocytes [1286]. these two hiv
protease inhibitors are potent inducers of cyp3a4/3a5, 2b6, 2c8
and 2c9. both ritonavir and nelfinavir  xxxd1891xxx  m induced  xxxg583xxx 
activity by 2- to 4-fold,  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9 activity by 2- to 4-fold
and the transcripts of  xxxg583xxx , 2c8, and 2c9 by 3- to 5-fold. rifampin (10 m) induced cyp3a4 transcripts,  xxxg590xxx  protein, and
activity by 23-, 12-, and 13-fold, respectively [1286].
in vivo, lopinavir/ritonavir induced the hepatic activity of
cyp2c9, 2c19, and 1a2 but inhibited the hepatic and intestinal
activity of  xxxg590xxx  in healthy subjects [1287]. lopinavir/ritonavir
and nelfinavir have been found to induce the clearance of warfarin
[1288-1292] and phenytoin [1293-1295].
5.2.2. avasimibe
avasimibe (2,6-bis(1-methylethyl)phenyl [[2,4,6-tris(1-methylethyl)phenyl]acetyl] sulfamate, also known as ci-1011 or pd
148515, fig. (167)) is a novel inhibitor of acyl-coa:cholesterol
acyltransferase (acat, ec2.3.1.26) [1296, 1297], which is currently used in clinical trials to assess its potential as an antiatherosclerotic drug. acat catalyzes the formation of intracellular
cholesteryl esters from free cholesterol and is considered to play a
critical role in cholesterol absorption and storage, lipoprotein production, and secretion and steroid hormone synthesis [1298]. inhibition of this enzyme has been recognized as a potential antiatherosclerotic target with the emphasis for therapeutic intervention shift-

zhou et al.

ing from inhibition of cholesterol absorption to direct effects on
developing atherosclerotic lesions [1298-1300]. in clinical studies,
a decrease in the auc of avasimibe was observed after multiple
dose administration, suggesting an auto-induction of its own metabolism or transport [1301]. when digoxin (a p-gp probe substrate)
was administered to healthy volunteers, a 40% decrease in digoxin
auc was observed by coadministered avasimibe 700 mg daily for
10 days [1302]. administration of avasimibe 50 mg and 750 mg
daily for 7 days also increased the clearance of midazolam (a
cyp3a4 probe) 3- and 5-fold, respectively. these studies confirmed avasimibe as an inducer of both cyp3a4 and  xxxg10xxx /p-gp
in human hepatocytes. induction of cyp3a4 and  xxxg10xxx  is mediated predominantly through activation of  xxxg1598xxx . avasimibe significantly activated  xxxg1598xxx  and was more potent than the prototypical
cyp3a4 inducer, rifampin (1 m avasimibe >> 10 m rifampin)
[1302]. in human liver microsomes, however, avasimibe was a
potent cyp2c9 inhibitor with ic50 of 2.9 m. avasimibe was a less
potent inhibitor of cyp1a2 (ic50: 13.9 m) and 2c19 (ic50: 26.5
m).
further studies in cultured human hepatocytes have revealed
that avasimibe induced  xxxg586xxx , 2c9 and 2b6 at mrna and protein levels [1303]. in addition, administration of avasimibe 750 mg
daily for 14 days to patients decreased the trough concentrations of
 xxxd990xxx  by 54.2% and decreased prothrombin times by 12, 15,
19, and 21% on days 6 through 9, respectively [1303]. five patients
had a decrease in prothrombin time and they had withdrawn from
the study. avasimibe appeared to be metabolized primarily by
cyp3a4 and 2c9 [1301]. pactimibe, another acat inhibitor under clinical evaluation, was metabolized by cyp3a4 and 2d6
[1304]. these results indicate that avasimibe is an inducer of
 xxxg586xxx /9, 3a4, 2b6 and  xxxg10xxx  in vitro and in vivo and it may
cause important clinical drug interactions.
5.2.3.  xxxd358xxx 
 xxxd358xxx  (fig. (74)), an endothelin receptor blocker, is an inducer of cyp2c9 and 3a4 in cultured human hepatocytes [1305].
in humans in vivo, cotreated  xxxd358xxx  decreased the auc or c max to
cyclosporine,  xxxd2215xxx , simvastatin and r- and  xxxd990xxx  by
up to 50%, due to induction of cyp2c9 and/or 3a4 [664, 1306].
there is a case report where the patient needed a 63.6% dosage
increase after the initiation of  xxxd358xxx  [1307].  xxxd358xxx  also decreased the auc of tadalafil (a potent pde5 inhibitor mainly metabolized by cyp3a4) by 41.5% in healthy volunteers [671].
 xxxd358xxx  decreased the auc of  xxxd2751xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx 
(major components of oral contraceptives) by 13.7 and 31.0%,
respectively, in healthy women [1308].
5.2.4. cyclophosphamide
auto-induction of cyclophosphamide (fig. (31)) and ifosfamide
metabolism has been observed within 12 to 24 hr after the start of
treatment. auto-induction is typically observed between day 1 to
day 5, but metabolic rates are always reset to initial base level at the
start of a consecutive course 3 weeks later [1309]. cyclophospahmide has been shown to induce cyp2c9 and 3a4 expression in a
concentration-dependent manner in cultured primary human hepatocytes [1310-1312]. exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to
250 m cyclophosphamide resulted in increased 6-hydroxylation
of testosterone and cyp3a4 protein level in human hepatocytes
[1310]. however, there was no increase in  xxxg583xxx  protein with
this same treatment of cyclophosphamide. in contrast, treatment of
primary human hepatocytes with cyclophosphamide at 1.0 mm
caused induction of  xxxg583xxx  at both protein and mrna levels
[1312]. additionally, cyclophosphamide induced the expression of
cyp3a4 and 2b6, but not 2c9, in human liver slices [1313]. in
contrast, cyclophosphamide treatment for up to 72 hr did not induce
 xxxg583xxx , 3a4, 2c9 and 2c19 at mrna and protein in hl-60 cells,
a human acute  xxxg1785xxx  cell line [1314], suggesting

that the cyp inducibility of cyclophosphamide is poor in white
blood cells.
by using transient transfection assay, cyclophosphamide treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in  xxxg1598xxx  activation that was
maximal at the highest cyclophosphamide concentration studied
(500 m). the addition of dexamethasone to cyclophosphamide
resulted in a minor increase in  xxxg1598xxx  activation compared with cyclophosphamide alone [1311]. however, the dose response for  xxxg1598xxx 
activation by cyclophosphamide does not appear to be sufficient to
explain entirely on the extent of induction that is observed in primary human hepatocyte cultures. this could be due to a number of
factors including the involvement of other nuclear receptors such as
car, gr and hnf-4, or the formation of active metabolites of
cyclophosphamide that are more efficacious activators of  xxxg1598xxx  in
primary cell culture systems. other mechanisms such as increased
stability of mrna, reduced cyp degradation and increased enzyme activity by allosteric binding possibly contribute the autoinduction.
6. inhibitors of cyp2c9
numerous compounds have been found to inhibit cyp2c9 in a
substrate- and inhibitor-dependent manner. many of these inhibitors
are substrates of cyp2c9 but some of them are not metabolized by
this enzyme. inhibition of cyp2c9 is an important source of the
large interindividual variability in the clearance of drugs that are
2c9 substrates and a major reason for many clinical drug interactions.
the type of cyp2c9 inhibition can be either reversible (competitive or non-competitive) or irreversible (mechanism-based).
reversible inhibition is the most common type of enzyme inhibition
and takes place directly, while irreversible inhibition requires
biotransformation of the inhibitor. reversible inhibition can be
further divided into competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive,
and mixed-type inhibition [1315, 1316]. in competitive situation,
substrate and inhibitor are competitory to bind to the same position
at the active site of an enzyme with hydrophobic, electrostatic or
hydrogen-bond interactions, which are both formed and broken
down easily [1315, 1316]. in a noncompetitive inhibition, however,
the binding site of the inhibitor is different from that of the substrate. as for mixed-type inhibition, both competitive and noncom-

petitive inhibitions are frequently observed. for example, in vitro
studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2215xxx  strongly inhibited
cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd990xxx  and phenytoin metabolism in a
competitive manner [1317].
irreversible inhibition of cyps, on the other hand, usually occurs by forming metabolite intermediate complexes, which bind to
the residues or heme of the cyp with strong covalent bond leading
to a long lasting inactivation [1318, 1319]. this process is called
mechanism based inhibition or suicide inhibition — the metabolic
product inactivates the enzyme completely. the typical feature of
mechanism-based inhibition is the time-, concentration- and
nadph-dependent and is terminated by enzyme re-synthesis
[1320-1322].
6.1. mechanism-based inhibitors of cyp2c9
6.1.1. silybin
silybin, a major active constituent of the milk thistle (silybum
marianum), is used to treat a variety of several liver disorders
[1323-1325]. the principal active components of milk thistle extract are the flavonolignans, collectively termed silymarin, present
as three isomers, namely silybin (silibinin), silychristin, and
silydianin. silybin is present as two diastereoisomers and represents
about 50 to 70% of the silymarin extract [1325]. silybin inactivated
recombinant cyp2c9 in a mechanism-based manner [1326]. the
inactivation was time-, concentration-, and nadph-dependent. the
7-ethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin o-deethylation activity of
human cyp2c9 was inactivated with a ki of 5 m, a kinact of 0.14
min-1, and a half-life of 7 min [1326]. silybin is not metabolized by
cyp2c9, but by  xxxg586xxx  [1327]. it formed o-demethylated (the
main metabolite) as well as mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives
in human liver microsomes (fig. (168)). recombinant  xxxg586xxx 
catalyzed o-demethylated of silybin [1327], but the enzymes for its
hydroxylation is unidentified yet.
6.1.2.  xxxd3265xxx 
 xxxd3265xxx , an nsaid of the 2-arylpropionic acid class which is
a substrate of cyp2c9 [52], is also a mechanism-based inhibitor of
cyp2c9-mediated diclofenac-4-hydroxylase activity [802]. human
recombinant cyp2c9 was inactivated by  xxxd3265xxx  in a nadph-,
time-, and concentration-dependent manner. the concentration that

(169). metabolism of tienilic acid. tienilic acid is mainly metabolized by cyp2c9, and to a lesser extent by 2c8, 2c18 and 2c19 to a reactive intermediate(s) that binds covalently to liver microsomal proteins including those enzymes metabolizing tienilic acid. a proposed mechanism of cyp2c9 inactivation
by tienilic acid involves the cyp-catalyzed oxidation on the thiophene sulfur, leading to a highly reactive thiophene-s-oxide intermediate. 1,6-michael addition of an active site amino acid residue at the c5 position of the reactive thiophene-s-oxide followed by dehydration yields the inactive cyp2c9/tienilic acid
adduct. alternately, nucleophilic 1, 6-addition of water or  xxxd2213xxx  followed by dehydration would form 5-hydroxytienilic acid, the major metabolite of tienilic acid, and the 5-glutathionyltienilic acid adduct, respectively. an alternate possible mechanism is that cyp2c9-catalyzed oxidation of the thiophene ring would form the reactive thiophene-4, 5-epoxide, nucleophilic ring, opening of which by an active site residue would produce a cyp2c9 adduct.
alternately, addition of glutathione across the epoxide followed by dehydration would result in the regio-isomeric thioethers. the thiophene epoxidation pathway also accounts for 5-hydroxytienilic acid formation that could result via an intermediate.

produced half-maximal inactivation (ki) was 3.7 m, and the
maximal rate of inactivation at saturation (kinact) was 0.091 min-1 .
thus, the half-life of inactivation (t1/2) was 7.6 min. given the obvious structural similarity between  xxxd3265xxx  and tienilic acid,  xxxd3265xxx  could function as a suicide inactivator of cyp2c9 via bioactivation of its thiophene ring (fig. (94)).
6.1.3. tienilic acid
tienilic acid (2,3-dichloro-4-(2-thienylcarbonyl)phenoxyacetic
acid) was a formerly used uricosuric diuretic in the treatment of
odema and hypertension in 1970s, but withdrawn from the market
in 1980 due to severe, sometimes fatal hepato- and renal toxicity
[1328]. tienilic acid-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized with
the presence of anti-lkm2 antibodies which are directed against
human cyp2c9 and rat cyp2c11 [1329-1332]. however, serum
from patients with tienilic acid-induced hepatitis recognized
cyp2c9, but not 2c8 or 2c18 [1333].
tienilic acid is a substrate and a suicide inhibitor of human
cyp2c9 [1334]. tienilic acid is mainly metabolized by cyp2c9,
and to a lesser extent by 2c8, 2c18 and 2c19 to a reactive intermediate(s) that binds covalently to liver microsomal proteins including
those enzymes metabolizing tienilic acid (fig. (169)) [1335-1338].
the effect of tienilic acid on cyp2c9 is similar to that for ticlopidine-induced cyp2c19 inactivation. both tienlic acid and
ticlopidine contain a thiophene ring that has been associated with a
significant incidence of adverse reactions [1334]. this also suggests
that a similar electrophilic intermediate, possibly a thiophene soxide, is involved in the inactivation of cyp2c19 and cyp2c9 by
ticlopidine and tienilic acid, respectively. a proposed mechanism of
cyp2c9 inactivation by tienilic acid involves the cyp-catalyzed
oxidation on the thiophene sulfur, leading to a highly reactive thiophene-s-oxide intermediate [1339, 1340]. 1,6-michael addition of

an active site amino acid residue at the c5 position of the reactive
thiophene-s-oxide followed by dehydration yields the inactive
cyp2c9/tienilic acid adduct. alternately, nucleophilic 1,6-addition
of water or  xxxd2213xxx  followed by dehydration would
form 5-hydroxytienilic acid, the major metabolite of tienilic acid,
and the 5-glutathionyltienilic acid adduct, respectively. an alternate
possible mechanism is that cyp2c9-catalyzed oxidation of the
thiophene ring would form the reactive thiophene-4,5-epoxide, nucleophilic ring, opening of which by an active site residue would
produce a cyp2c9 adduct [1341, 1342]. alternately, addition of
glutathione across the epoxide followed by dehydration would result in the regioisomeric thioethers. the thiophene epoxidation
pathway also accounts for 5-hydroxytienilic acid formation that
could result via an intermediate.
6.2. competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of cyp2c9
6.2.1. amiodarone and its analogs
amiodarone (fig. (27)) decreased cyp2c9-mediated warfarin
[1343] and phenytoin [1344, 1345] clearance in humans. amiodarone is a weak inhibitor of cyp2c9, but it inactivated cyp3a4
[1346]. desethylamiodarone, a metabolite of amiodarone, is a potent and competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd990xxx  7hydroxylation with a ki of 2.3 m in vitro [1346]. desethylamiodarone also inactivated  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, 2b6, and 2d6. however,
the in vitro 7-methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin and naproxen
demethylation was activated by amiodarone [101, 1347], suggesting
that the type of inhibitory or activating effect observed may be analog- and substrate-dependent.
kumar et al. (2006) [1348] investigated the effect of several
amiodarone analogs including desethylamiodarone, benzbromarone,
and its dimethyl analog (benzmetharone) (fig. (170)) on the de-

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

methylation of naproxen by cyp2c9.1 or cyp2c9.3. benzbromarone contains a benzofuran primary structure like amiodarone
but is substantially smaller in size because of the bromine substitutions, the ethyl group at c2, and the absence of the tertiary amino
group that is attached to the phenolic oxygen of amiodarone.
benzmetharone possesses methyl groups substituted for the bromines, rendering the compound much smaller in size and less acidic.
benzmetharone is a potent inhibitor of cyp2c9-meidated warfarin
metabolism [62]. amiodarone activated naproxen demethylation at
lower concentrations (<1.25 m), regardless of the cyp2c9 genotype, and inhibited naproxen metabolism at higher concentrations
(>12.5 m) but it di not affect the kinetic profile. a more substantial activation of naproxen demethylation was noted in cyp2c9.3,
with 60% activation at 37.5 m amiodarone [1348]. in contrast,
desethylamiodarone was a potent inhibitor of naproxen demethylation at all concentrations in both cyp2c9.1 and cyp2c9.3 but it
did not alter the kinetic profile. benzbromarone at higher concentrations altered naproxen demethylation kinetics from a biphasic
profile to that of a more hyperbolic form in both cyp2c9.1 and
cyp2c9.3, resulting in inhibition and activation, respectively.
however, benzmetharone activated naproxen demethylation in both
cyp2c9.1 and cyp2c9.3 [1348]. it altered the kinetics from a
biphasic profile to a more hyperbolic profile at concentrations of
benzmetharone up to 800 nm. these results demonstrate a concentration-, analog- and genotype-dependent effect on cyp2c9mediated naproxen metabolism.
in the following docking studies using the 1r9o crystal structure, s-naproxen was orientation in the active site of 1r9o as  xxxd2141xxx , with carboxylate interactions at the arg108 and asn204
sidechains and the site of metabolism closest to the heme moiety
[1348]. desethylamiodarone docked with its dealkylated amine
oriented away from the heme and interacting with glu104.
benzbromarone docked with its deprotonated phenol oxygen near
the sidechain of arg108 to form an ionic interaction and placing the
benzofuran over the heme. benzbromarone is negatively charged at
physiological ph, but benzmetharone is not. this may provide an
explanation for the difference as evidenced by the preferential positioning of benzbromarone at the cationic naproxen binding site.
6.2.2. angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists
several studies have revealed that angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists including candesartan, irbesartan, losartan and  xxxd3487xxx 
(fig. (22)) inhibited cyp2c9 with different potency [1349, 1350].

in human liver microsomes, losartan, irbesartan,  xxxd3487xxx , and
candesartan inhibited cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd3394xxx  methylhydroxylation, with ki values of 4.1, 24.5, 135 and 155 m, respectively [1350]. losartan and irbesartan also inhibited cyp1a2mediated ethoxyresorufin o-deethylation and cyp3a4-meidated
testosterone 6-hydroxylation with relatively high ic50 values (200
and 500 m). in addition, losartan inhibited cyp2c19 with an ic50
value of 138 m.  xxxd3487xxx  and candesartan inhibited cyp2c9
only. these results suggest that the potential for drug interactions
with angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists is likely to be low, with the
possible exceptions of losartan and irbesartan for cyp2c9.
kamiyama et al. (2007) [1349] further investigated the effect of
candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, e-3174 (losartan active metabolite), olmesartan,  xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  on the cyp2c9 activity
in human liver microsomes using  xxxd990xxx  as a probe substrate.
all the angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists tested except olmesartan
and  xxxd3487xxx  inhibited the activity of 7-hydroxylation of  xxxd990xxx 
with ic50 values of 39.5-116 m. of six synthetic derivatives of
olmesartan (fig. (171)), five compounds with either alkyl groups or
a chloro group at the same position as that of the hydroxyisopropyl
group in olmesartan (rnh-6384, rnh-6390, rnh-6391, rnh6458 and rnh-8239) showed inhibitory effect on cyp2c9 with
ic50 values of 21.7-161 m [1349]. however, olmesartan and the
olmesartan analogue, rnh-6272, both containing a hydroxyisopropyl group, did not inhibit cyp2c9. the replacement of the hydroxyisopropyl group with alkyl groups converts the molecule from
a non-inhibitor of cyp2c9 to a cyp2c9 inhibitor. interestingly,
the ic50 value of rnh-8239, which contains a chloro group at the
same position, was 21.7 m and its inhibitory effect was the highest among olmesartan analogues and other angiotensin-ii receptor
antagonists. these data suggest that the chloro group increases the
affinity for cyp2c9. a three-dimensional model for docking between e-3174 and cyp2c9 indicated that the chloro group of e3174 is oriented to a hydrophobic pocket in the cyp2c9 active site
[1349], indicating that the lipophilicity of the group present in angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists at the position corresponding to
that of the hydroxyisopropyl group in olmesartan is important for
inhibiting cyp2c9 activity. from the inhibitory effect of olmesartan analogs and the docking model analysis, the low affinity of
olmesartan to cyp2c9 is considered to be due to the presence of an
additional polar group, namely a hydroxyisopropyl group, which
cannot interact with the hydrophobic pocket of cyp2c9.

6.2.4. antiparasitic drugs
bapiro et al. (2001) [1353] investigated the inhibitory effects of
29 clinically important antiparasitic drugs (fig. (173)) on human
cyp1a2, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6, and 3a4 activities using fluorescencebased high throughput screening assays with recombinant cyps.
the authors found that  xxxd2720xxx  activated 7-methoxy-4trifluoromethylcoumarin demethylase activity to 400% of control
incubations but caused a significant inhibition of diclofenac 4hydroxylase activity with ki of 6.0 m.  xxxd243xxx  activated
cyp1a2 and  xxxd1879xxx  activated cyp2c19. interestingly, coincubation of  xxxd2720xxx  with sulfaphenazole (a potent
inhibitor of cyp2c9) inhibited the enzyme activity by 30% only,
resulting from abolished activation by  xxxd2720xxx  and reduced
inhibitory effect of sulfaphenazole.

6.2.3. anti-hiv agents
delavirdine, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase, inhibited cyp2c9-catalyzed diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation
with a ki of 2.6 m [1351]. there was no evidence for bioactivation
as prerequisite to inhibition of cyp2c9. desalkyl delavirdine, the
major circulating metabolite of delavirdine, had no apparent effect
on microsomal cyp2c9 activity at concentrations up to 20 m.
several analogs of delavirdine with the sulfonamide, piperazine, or
alkyl substituents including pnu-88204, pnu-90238 and pnu95133 (fig. (172)) showed similar inhibiton of cyp2c9 [1351].
delavirdine was mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 and 2d6, but not
metabolized by either cyp2c9 or 2c19 [1352].

artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin,  xxxd3345xxx , primaquine,
and  xxxd2720xxx  inhibited cyp1a2-catalyzed 3-cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin deethylation, with ki values of 0.43, 3.67, 1.54, 0.22, and
2.70 m, respectively [1353].  xxxd1672xxx , cycloguanil,  xxxd159xxx ,
desethylamodiaquine, chloroquine, and quinine inhibited cyp2d6catalyzed  xxxd380xxx  1’-hydroxylation with ki values of
6.76, 5.97, 2.1, 4.13, 12.68, and 15.51 m, respectively. based on
these in vitro inhibition data, it was predicted that  xxxd3345xxx ,
primaquine, and artemisinin would significantly inhibit cyp1a2 in
vivo by 98, 67, and 76%, respectively;  xxxd159xxx  and its metabolite desethylamodiaquine would inhibit about 97 and 99% of
cyp2d6 activity in vivo, respectively [1353].
6.2.5. benzbromarone and its analogs
the uricosuric agent benzbromarone was one of the most potent
and competitive cyp2c9 inhibitors with a ki < 10 nm [1354]. the
combination of two halogens and a ketone on the phenol ring lowers the pka of the phenol to less than 5.2, and therefore, benzbro-

delavirdine was a mechanism-based inhibitor of cyp3a4 in vitro [474]. delavirdine significantly inhibited cyp2c19-catalyzed
s- xxxd2568xxx  4’-hydroxylation in a non-competitive manner, with
an apparent ki of 24 m [1351]. delavirdine competitively inhibited

to a larger n-butyl group (analog 5) increased the ki from 19 nm to
91 nm. a decrease in entropy upon binding or increased steric hindrance may result in an increased ki value. in contrast, change of
the ethyl group to a methyl group (analog 7) increased the binding
affinity with a ki of 9.7 nm. substitution of halogens adjacent to the
phenol oxygen (analog 8) greatly increased binding affinity. 3,5dihalogenation of benzbromarone is largely responsible for producing the tightest cyp2c9 binder with a ki of 1 nm. methylbenzbromarone (analog 4) with a log d7.0 value of 6.2 (the highest) had a
ki of 232 nm, which was comparable to analog 3 (ki = 414 nm),
suggesting a role for halogen-induced lipophilicity. when methylbenzbromarone (analog 4) which is nonionizable was used as a

substrate, cyp2c9 o-demethylated this analog to produce
benzbromarone. a nonsubstituted phenol analog without 3,5dihalogenation (analog 3) was determined to have a pka of 8.4 and a
ki of 414 nm whereas those with dihalogenated benzoyl phenols
(e.g. analogs 5-8) had pka values between 4.2 to 5.2 and ki values
as low as 1 nm for analog 8 [1355]. the ki value of analog 3 decreased about 40-fold when brominated to result in analog 7 (from
414 to 9.7 nm). the nonhalogenated and nonionizable analog (analog 2) was the poorest binder for cyp2c9 with a ki of 796 nm. the
ki range of these analogs covers around three orders of magnitude
(1 to 796 nm) with even the weakest binder being a more potent
inhibitor than the cyp2c9 substrate phenytoin. these results sup-

ported the existence of a cyp2c9 anion-binding site. the anionic
benzbromarone analogs 5 and 8 are favored over the h-bond donor
analog 3 by cyp2c9 and these compounds exist as anions even in
the lower dielectric of the cyp2c9 active site [1356]. other
cyp2c9 substrates including diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen and
 xxxd3394xxx  are all ionized at physiological ph. there is a potential
for drug interactions of benzbromarone with other drugs that are
metabolized by cyp2c9. for example, benzbromarone increased
the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in patients [1357].
6.2.6. cimetidine
cimetidine (fig. (175)) is a weak inhibitor of cyp2c9 in vitro
[990], with an apparent ki of 327 =m. coadministration of cimetidine 1 g/day had no effect on the kinetics of  xxxd3394xxx  but a
higher dose (1.6 g/day) decreased the systemic and metabolic clearances of  xxxd3394xxx  by about 40% in healthy volunteers [1358].
cimetidine caused only a modest reduction in the clearance of
phenytoin, although clinically significant increases in plasma
phenytoin levels have been observed in patients receiving long-term
phenytoin treatment [1359]. cotreatment with cimetidine 1 g/day
decreased the plasma clearance of racemic warfarin by more than
25% in healthy subjects and enhanced the anticoagulant activity in
patients on warfarin [1360-1362]. pretreatment with cimetidine 0.8
g/day caused a stereo-selective reduction in the plasma clearance of
the r-warfarin via inhibition of 6 and 7-hydroxylations [13631365]. in contrast, ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx  (fig. (175)) did not
affect the disposition and clearance of warfarin and phenytoin in
humans [1362, 1366].

6.2.7. ethanol
in recombinant cyp2c9, the 7-hydroxylation of  xxxd990xxx  was
inhibited by as low as 0.1 vol% (17 mm) ethanol [1367]. ethanol
decreased the v max/km and vmax values of  xxxd990xxx  metabolism in
a concentration-dependent manner, but the km value was unchanged by ethanol. however, the inhibitory effect of ethanol on
the 4’-hydroxylation of diclofenac was not observed even at 1.0
vol% (170 mm) ethanol. ethanol at a concentration of 3.0 vol%
(510 mm) increased the k m value of diclofenac metabolism without
changes in the v max, which indicates that diclofenac 4’hydroxylation by cyp2c9 was competitively inhibited by ethanol
[1367]. these results indicate that  xxxd990xxx  metabolism by
cyp2c9 is more sensitive to ethanol than diclofenac metabolism
and ethanol inhibits the metabolism by cyp2c9 in a substratedependent manner.
6.2.8.  xxxd2154xxx 
yao et al. (2006) [1368] investigated the inhibitory effect of
two saturated  xxxd2154xxx  ( xxxd2833xxx  and  xxxd3244xxx ) and 5 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (linoleic acid,  xxxd2490xxx , arachidonic
acid,  xxxd2318xxx  and docosahexaenoic acid on the activites of cyp1a2, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6,  xxxd851xxx  and 3a4. all the five examined polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  competitively inhibited cyp2c9
and 2c19, with ki values of 1.7 to 4.7 and 2.3 to 7.4 m, respectively. these polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  also competitively inhibited cyp1a2,  xxxd851xxx  and 3a4 to a lesser extent with ki values >10
m [1368]. in contrast, palmitic and stearic acids showed no inhibi-

fibrates, a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids, are used in the

 xxxd331xxx , ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil and  xxxd2096xxx . gemfibrozil,
a fibric acid derivative used in the treatment of dyslipidaemias,
competitively inhibited cyp2c9 with a ki of 5.8 m in vitro
[1369], and this is the possible mechanism by which gemfibrozil
enhanced the effects of warfarin [1370] and  xxxd2215xxx  [1371]. gemfibrozil also inhibited cyp2c19 and 1a2, with apparent ki values
of 24 and 82 m, respectively [1369]. furthermore, genfibrozil is a
competitive inhibitor of  xxxg586xxx  with a ki of 87 m, but is not an
inhibitor for  xxxg582xxx , 2d6,  xxxd851xxx  and 3a4 [1372]. gemfibrozil is
mainly glucuronidated by ugt1a1, 1a3, 1a4, 2b4, 2b7 and 2b14
with 2b7 being the major catalyst (fig. (176)) [1373].  xxxd2141xxx 
and  xxxd2556xxx  acid inhibited gemfibrozil glucuronidation in human liver microsomes.  xxxg586xxx  converted gemfibrozil acyl glucuronide into a hydroxylated derivative [892].

6.2.10. nsaids
many nsaids are metabolized by cyp2c9 (see section
4.2.27) and are also inhibitors of this enzyme. for example, phenylbutazone, an nsaid used in the treatment of arthritis, was a
competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation in human liver microsomes with a ki of 11 m [990]. in vivo,
both phenylbutazone and its metabolite  xxxd2815xxx  are potent
inhibitors of  xxxd3394xxx  metabolism [1374]. although a single
dose of these compounds had little or no effect on  xxxd3394xxx 
elimination, pretreatment for 1 week with either compound more
than doubled the elimination half-life of  xxxd3394xxx  (7.9-8.1 vs
23.1-30.2 hr). however, a single dose of sulfaphenazole increased
the  xxxd3394xxx  half-life from 9.2 to 25.7 hr [1374]. in addition,
phenylbutazone pretreatment reduced the clearance of  xxxd990xxx 
but increases r-warfarin clearance by an almost equivalent extent in
humans [1375]. overall, the rate of clearance of racemic warfarin
was unaffected by phenylbutazone, since the depression of the rate
of clearance of the s-isomer masked the stimulation of the clearance of the r-isomer by phenylbutazone.

6.2.11. oral hypoglycemics
 xxxd2215xxx , a substrate of cyp2c9, inhibited cyp2c9catalyzed  xxxd990xxx  and phenytoin metabolism in a competitive
manner, with ki values of 2.4 and 3.1 m, respectively [1317].
 xxxd2215xxx  is more potent than several other cyp2c9 inhibitors,
including gemfibrozil (ki = 5.8 m) [1369], fluconazole (ki = 8
m) [1376], and  xxxd3394xxx  (ki 100 m) [1377].  xxxd2203xxx  is
also a potent competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9 with a ki of 1.0 m
[1378].  xxxd2215xxx  is not a mechanism-based inhibitor of cyp2c9.
 xxxd2215xxx  inhibited the metabolism of coadministered drugs such
as cyclosporine [1379] and warfarin [1380].  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited
cyp3a4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation in vitro with a ki of
42.5 m. coadministration of  xxxd2215xxx  resulted in a 57% increase
in the auc of cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients
[1379]. xxxd2215xxx  has been shown to enhance the anticoagulant
effect of warfarin, resulting in fatal hypothrombinemia [1380]. on
the other hand, coadministration of cotrimoxazole [1381], cimetidine [1382],  xxxd2640xxx  [1383], fluconazole [1384], and gemfibrozil [1371], which are all cyp2c9 inhibitors, reduced the clearance of  xxxd2215xxx  and/or caused hypoglycemia.
6.2.12. ppis
li et al. (2004) [1385] examined the inhibitory effect of 5 ppis
including omeprazole, esomeprazole,  xxxd2444xxx , pantoprazole,
and  xxxd3070xxx  (fig. (111)) on the activity of cyp2c9, 2c19,
2d6, and 3a4 using human liver microsomes or recombinant enzyme (2c19 only). all ppis examined showed inhibitory effects on
the formation of cyp2c9-catalyzed 4’-hydroxylation of diclofenac
in a competitive manner except for esomeprazole, which was best
fit in a mixed inhibition model. the respective ki values were 6, 16,
21, and 51 m for pantoprazole, omeprazole,  xxxd2444xxx , and
 xxxd3070xxx , respectively (2004) [1385]. compared with omeprazole and its r-enantiomer, the inhibitory effect of esomeprazole was
significantly lower on diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation, with a ki of 82
m. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3070xxx  thioether was about 9-fold
stronger (ki = 6 m) than that of its parent drug (2004) [1385].
all ppis tested exhibited a competitive inhibition against
cyp2c19 activity with ki of 0.4 to 1.5 m for  xxxd2444xxx , 2 to 6
m for omeprazole, 8 m for esomeprazole, 14 to 69 m for pantoprazole, and 17 to 21 m for  xxxd3070xxx  (2004) [1385].  xxxd3070xxx  thioether was a competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9, 2c19, 2d6

and 3a4 with ki values of 6, 8, 12, and 15 m, respectively. romeprazole showed higher inhibitory potency than its s-isomer on
cyp2c9 and 2c19 activities. pantoprazole showed a higher inhibitory effect (ki = 22 m) on cyp3a4-catalyzed midazolam 1’hydroxylation than omeprazole (ki = 42 m), esomeprazole (ki =
47 m), and  xxxd3070xxx  (ki = 51 m). however, none of the ppis
inhibited cyp2d6-catalyzed  xxxd380xxx  1’-hydroxylation. since the
ki values for cyp2c9 and 2c19 and ppi combinations are lower
than their unbound plasma concentrations encountered in vivo, this
suggests a minor to moderate potential of drug interactions for ppis
during drug combination treatment. for example, omeprazole inhibited diazepam clearance in humans [1386], but  xxxd2444xxx  had no
significant effect on diazepam [1387] or warfarin clearance [1388]
in vivo.  xxxd2444xxx  and omeprazole, but not  xxxd3070xxx , increased the trough concentration of tacrolimus in liver or kidney
transplant patients [1389, 1390] or healthy subjects [1391]. indeed,
many published clinical drug interaction studies have indicated that
there are no clinically relevant drug interactions existing for this
class of compounds [1392].
6.2.13. imidazole antifungal agents
antifungal imidazole derivatives are frequently used both systemically and topically in the treatment of systemic candidal infections and mycoses. several azole antifungal agents including
 xxxd1732xxx , fluconazole,  xxxd2640xxx , sulconazole, and  xxxd3380xxx 
(fig. (177)) have been shown to inhibit cyp2c9. fluconazole has
been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cyp2c9-catalysed reactions
in vitro, including  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation [1393], diclofenac 4’hydroxylation, and  xxxd990xxx  6- and 7-hydroxylation [1376]. fluconazole inhibited  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation in a mixed mechanism with a ki of 8 m.
 xxxd1732xxx  was a potent inhibitor of cyp2c9 in human liver
microsomes with an apparent ki of 1 bm [1393].  xxxd2640xxx  inhibited warfarin 6- and 7-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes
according to a mixed model and consistently reduced the clearance
of  xxxd990xxx  by 80% in vivo [1394]. ketoconazole inhibited  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation in vitro with an apparent ki of 8 bm, but its
affinity for cyp2c9 was 10-fold lower than that for cyp3a4
[1395, 1396]. ketoconazole, a selective inhibitor of cyp3a4
[1397], was a weak inhibitor of cyp2c9 in vitro at higher concentrations [1398] and it did not affect the pharmacokinetics of losartan
and phenytoin [452, 1399].

fig. (178). chemical structures of quinoline-4-carboxamide analogues.

zhang et al. (2002) [1400] investigated the inhibitory effect of
five antifungal imidazole derivatives including  xxxd1732xxx ,  xxxd2640xxx , sulconazole,  xxxd3380xxx , and ketoconazole (fig. (177))
on the activity of cyp2c9 and other cyps using corresponding
probes. sulconazole inhibited cyp2c9-catalyzed diclofenac 4’hydroxylation with a ki of 0.01 m, followed by  xxxd3380xxx  (0.7
m),  xxxd2640xxx  (1.2 m) and  xxxd1732xxx  (12 m) [1400]. the
n-substituted group at the imidazole moiety appears to influence
the inhibition of cyp3a4; the ki value of sulconazole (100 nm) is
about 5 times less potent than  xxxd1732xxx  (18 nm),  xxxd2640xxx 
(28 nm), and  xxxd3380xxx  (20 nm) [1400]. ketoconazole, which
possesses a large n-substituted group not present in the other imidazole-containing compounds tested, demonstrated much greater

cyp3a4 selectivity than all of the other compounds tested. the
lipophilicity of side chains is also a determining factor in the inhibitory potency for cyp3a4 and 2c9. the potency of cyp inhibition
observed with  xxxd1732xxx ,  xxxd2640xxx , sulconazole, and  xxxd3380xxx  suggests that the imidazole group is important to cyp inhibition in vitro. in addition, the active sites of cyps probably determine whether an n-substituted group at the imidazole moiety is able
to facilitate the coordination of the imidazole nitrogen atom to the
hemoprotein or hinder the interaction.
6.2.14. quinoline-4-carboxamide analogues
during routine screening of various inhibitors of cyp2c9, a
quinoline-4-carboxamide compound was found to inhibit this en-

3624 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

 xxxg1282xxx  with a low ki value. in order to investigate the role that nitrogen coordination to the heme plays in type ii substrate binding interactions with cyp2c9, peng et al. (2008) [1401] have synthesized a series of quinoline-4-carboxamide analogues (fig. (178))
and compared their inhibitory effect on cyp2c9-mediated diclofenac hydroxylation. the compounds were then docked into the
crystal structure of 1r9o [80] using the moe 2006.08 program
(chemical computing group inc. montreal, quebec, canada).
when incubated with purified 2c9, analogues 10 and 13 resulted in typical type ii binding spectra [1401]. the ki value of
compound 10 for inhibiton of diclofenac hydroxylation was 113 nm
in the purified system and 125 nm in the baculosomes. for analogue 13, the ki was 79.8 nm in the purified system and 100 nm in
the baculosome system. compound 14 gave a peak at 415 nm but
there was no obvious trough in the difference spectra, implying that
this analogue caused mixed type ii and type i binding. analogues 7,
8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21 were examined by electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) to probe binding modes. analogues with the
pyridine nitrogen in the para position to the linkage (7, 16, 19, and
21), epr spectra showed a low-spin shift which was not observed
with analogues containing nitrogen in the meta or ortho position
[1401]. the epr spectrum of substrate-free cyp2c9 had g-values
at 2.42/2.38, 2.24, and 1.92, and the type ii binding substrate bound
2c9 spectrum gave g-values at 2.51, 2.26, and 1.88. this suggests
that the para nitrogen is coordinated to the heme iron, whereas the
meta and ortho compounds are not. the ortho nitrogen linkage had
a much longer nfe bond and significantly distorted the heme from
planarity, while the meta and para linkage both had 2.1 å nfe
bond lengths with only a slight distortion in the planarity of the
heme [1401].
the pka value for the ortho  xxxd774xxx  was 3.05, while the
values for para (16) and meta (17) compounds were 4.27 and 4.30,
respectively [1401]. this indicates that the difference in binding
affinity for analogues with the ortho linkage may be complicated by
differences in solvation. analogues 4, 5, and 6 containing
piperidine nitrogen were predicted to have pka values of 9.1, and
they would exist in their protonated forms at physiological ph. in
general, positively charged compounds do not bind strongly to
cyp2c9, which may explain the overall low affinity of analogues
4, 5, and 6 for the enzyme.
the authors docked two tight binders, analogues 7 and 8, into
the active site of 1r9o to ascertain specific substrate-protein interactions [1401]. both of these compounds contain naphthalene functionalized amides and differ only in the position of the sp2 nitrogen
in the pyridine moiety. analogue 7 formed a direct coordination
between the heme and the para pyridine nitrogen and this pyridine
ring system was tilted away from helix i [1401]. in this orientation,
the naphthalene ring faced phe114, facilitating an edge-to-face 
interaction. in addition, the positively charged side chain of arg108
was oriented in such a manner to allow interaction with the naphthalene ring through parallel stacking geometry. presumably, a cation interaction from the positively charged arg108 side chain
with the aromatic ring of amide allows for favorable enthalpic contribution of van der waals and electrostatic interaction [1401].
moreover, the quinoline ring portion of 7 was orientated in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by phe476, leu208, ile205, and
leu362. this conformation facilitates potential - interactions
between the quinoline ring and phe476. the proposed binding orientation for analogue 8 did not have the nitrogen atom coordinated
to the heme iron, probably deu to a steric interference with helix i,
although all the other ligand-residue interactions are similar to those
for analogue 7 [1401].
overall, compounds with a para nitrogen in the pyridine ring
bind more tightly than meta or ortho analogues, and compounds
with meta nitrogens are better binders than ortho compounds. para
compounds generally bind to cyp2c9 with ki between 9 and 125

zhou et al.

nm except for compounds 1 and 4, which had ki values of 9.94 and
3.67 hm, respectively [1401]. the binding affinity of para compounds are increased by a factor of up to 4,200-fold compared with
meta compounds (e.g. 21 and 22) and a factor of up to 1,900-fold
compared with ortho analogues (e.g. 16 and 18) [1401]. meta compounds showed a larger range of binding affinities to cyp2c9, with
ki values ranging from 0.15 to 37.85 hm, and these compounds can
be 300-fold tighter binders than ortho compounds. in general, ortho
compounds bind less tightly than those of their para and meta counterparts. ki values of ortho compounds ranged from 76.1 to 1.32
hm [1401]. the most likely explanation for these results is that the
para compounds are capable of causing stronger type ii binding
interaction than the meta compounds, which gave a stronger type ii
interaction than the ortho compounds.
6.2.15. statins
several statins are found to be inhibitors of cyp2c9. fluvastatin inhibits cyp2c9 in vitro [1030, 1040] and in vivo [1402].
fluvastatin inhibited cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd3394xxx  and diclofenac
hydroxylation with ki values of 0.3 and 0.5 m, respectively [1030,
1040]. fluvastatin also inhibited cyp3a4 and 2d6 with ki of >50
m [1040]. pravastatin, lovastatin acid, and simvastatin acid are
moderate inhibitors of cyp2c9 with ki of >50 m [1040].
6.2.16.  xxxd3256xxx  and its metabolites
the  xxxd3256xxx  sulfide is a 27-fold more potent inhibitor of
cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation compared to the
parent drug in human liver microsomes [1065]. the ki values for
 xxxd3256xxx  and two major metabolites,  xxxd3256xxx  sulfide
and  xxxd3256xxx  sulfone were 230, 17, and 73 m, respectively
[1065]. in healthy subjects, co-administration of  xxxd3256xxx 
reduced the plasma clearance of  xxxd3394xxx  by 40% and prolonged
its half-life by 80% [1403]. in humans, concomitant  xxxd3256xxx 
significantly decreased the clearance of  xxxd990xxx , and increased
clearance of r-warfarin [1404].  xxxd3256xxx  also decreased the
urinary excretion of 7-oh-warfarin but increased their fecal excretion by an equivalent amount.  xxxd3256xxx  also increased free
fraction of both enantiomers of  xxxd2911xxx  in human plasma
and inhibition of 7-hydroxylation of s- xxxd2911xxx  [1405].
since the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3256xxx  sulfide on cyp2c9 in
vitro was more than 25-fold that of  xxxd3256xxx  and because it
attained plasma concentrations at least equal to those of the parent
drug during multiple dosing of  xxxd3256xxx , the sulphide is considered the major inhibitor of cyp2c9 and the primary cause of the
clinical interaction with other drugs that are mainly metabolized by
this enzyme.
6.2.17. sulfonamides
several sulfonamides (fig. (179)) have been found to be selective inhibitors of cyp2c9. sulfaphenazole, a sulfonamide antibacterial agent, is a commonly used selective and competitive inhibitor
of cyp2c9-catalyzed hydroxylation of  xxxd3394xxx , phenytoin and
 xxxd990xxx  with ki of 0.1-0.3 m [25, 969, 990, 1406, 1407], but it
also shows some inhibitory effects toward  xxxg586xxx  (ki = 63 m)
and 2c18 (ki = 29 m) [53]. cyp2c19 is not affected by sulfaphenazole at concentrations up to 100 hm. mechanism-based
inhibition is not involved in the inhibition of cyp2c9 by sulfaphenazole.
mancy et al. (1996) [53] compared the spectral interaction and
inhibitory effects of twelve sulfaphenazole (pka = 6.0) analogs
(fig. (5)) with cyp 2c9 and found that the aniline function was
responsible for the formation of the iron-nitrogen bond of the 429
nm-absorbing complex and was needed for the inhibitory effect of
sulfaphenazole as compounds 2 (n-acetylsulfaphenazole), 3 and 4
without the aniline function could not bind to cyp2c9. when the
n-phenyl group of sulfaphenazole was replaced with an ethyl group
(compound 6), or the phenylpyrazole was replaced by a pyrimidine
(sulfadiazine), isoxazole (sulfisoxazole), and benzoyl group (sulfa-

benzamide), the compounds did not bind to and inhibit cyp2c9. in
contrast, when the n-phenyl group of sulfaphenazole was replaced
with a 3,4-dichlorophenyl group (compound 5), the compound
strongly inhibited cyp2c9 [53]. compound 5 has showed the
highest affinity for cyp2c9 with ks of 0.1 m. these results demonstrate the critical role of the substituents at position 1 of the  xxxd3045xxx  ring for a strong interaction of sulfaphenazole with cyp2c9.
a model for the binding of sulfaphenazole in the cyp2c9 active
site has been proposed, taking into account three major interactions
responsible for the high-affinity and specific inhibitory effects of
sulfaphenazole for cyp2c9: the binding of its nh2 nitrogen atom
to cyp2c9 iron (which results in the appearance of the observed
difference spectrum), an interaction of its n-phenyl group with an
hydrophobic residues of the protein active site or a - stacking
interaction with the aromatic residues of cyp2c9; and possibly an
ionic interaction of its so2n- anionic site with a cationic residue of
cyp2c9.
marques-soares et al. (2003) [1408] further investigated the inhibitory effect of five synthesized sulfaphenazole derivatives (fig.
(180)) on rabbit cyp2c5 and human cyp2cs. sulfaphenazole and
compound 1 derived from sulfaphenazole by replacement of its
nh2 substituent with a methyl group, both potent inhibitors of
cyp2c9, showed very little inhibitory effect on cyp2c5-mediated
21-hydroxylation of progesterone, whereas neutral, n-alkylated

derivatives (compounds 2, 3, 4 and 5) exhibited significant inhibition with ic50 values of 8-22 =m. compound 2 was a competitive
inhibitor of cyp2c5 with a ki value of 4 =m. interestingly, compound 4 ( xxxd1143xxx , dmz) that derives from sulfaphenazole by replacement of its nh2 substituent with a methyl group and by nmethylation of its sulfonamide moiety, was found to be a good
substrate for rabbit cyp2c5 and human cyp2cs (fig. (181))
[1408]. hydroxylation of the benzylic methyl of compound 4 was
the major reaction catalyzed by cyp2c5, 2c9, 2c18, and 2c19
with km values between 5 and 13 =m and kcat values between 16
and 90 min-1, whereas hydroxylation of its n-phenyl group was a
minor oxidative pathway [1408].
another sulfonamide antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, has been
shown to inhibit cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation with
an apparent ki value of 250 m [1016]. trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole appear selective inhibitors of  xxxg586xxx  and 2c9,
respectively [1409]. with concentrations ranging from 50 to
500 m, sulfamethoxazole was a selective inhibitor of cyp2c9mediated  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation in human liver microsomes
and recombinant cyp2c9, with apparent ic50 values of 544 and
456 m, respectively [1409]. trimethoprim showed a selective
inhibitory effect on  xxxg586xxx -mediated paclitaxel 6-hydroxylation
in human liver microsomes and recombinant  xxxg586xxx , with appar-

fig. (181). metabolism of a sulfaphenazole derivative (compound 4, dmz) by cyp2cs. dmz derives from sulfaphenazole by replacement of its nh2 substituent with a methyl group and by n-methylation of its sulfonamide moiety, was found to be a good substrate for rabbit cyp2c5 and human cyp2cs. hydroxylation of the benzylic methyl of dmz was the major reaction catalyzed by cyp2c5, 2c9, 2c18, and 2c19, whereas hydroxylation of its n-phenyl group
was a minor oxidative pathway.

ent ic50 values of 54 and 75 m, respectively. trimethoprim is
frequently combined with sulfamethoxazole as cotrimoxazole, a
broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, to treat a wide range of infections.

komatsu et al. (2000) [1016] investigated the inhibitory effects
of eight sulfonamides (fig. (179)) on cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation in both human liver microsomes and recombinant cyp2c9. sulfaphenazole produced a ki value of 0.3 m in

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

human liver microsomes, which was the most potent inhibitor.
among the sulfonamides investigated, sulfadiazine and sulfamethizole were relatively potent inhibitors with ki values of 46.2 and
53.4 m, respectively. sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, and sulfadimethoxine were moderate 2c9 inhibitors only,
with ki values of 161, 283, 427 and 436 m, respectively [1016].
sulfamonomethoxine was a weak 2c9 inhibitor with ki > 500 m.
the ki values of sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine and sulfamethizole in
the recombinant cyp2c9 were slightly higher than those in human
liver microsomes.
6.2.18. warfarin analogues
zhang et al. (1997) [1410] investigated the inhibitory effect of
warfarin analogs (fig. (8)) on cyp2c9-catalyzed  xxxd990xxx  7hydroxylation in human liver microsomes. the authors revealed
that both r- and s-7-fluorowarfarin were potent competitive inhibitors of cyp2c9 with ki values of 18 and <1 m, respectively. racemic 6-fluorowarfarin and 6,7,8-trifluorowarfarin were mixed
inhibitors with some competitive inhibition against cyp2c9, with
ki values of 34 and 5 m, respectively [1410]. for the alcohols
generated by reductive methylation of the side chain of r- and swarfarin, the r-isomer did not inhibit  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation,
whereas the s-enantiomer was a competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9
with a ki of 7.5 m [1410]. these results indicate that the fluorinesubstituted warfarin derivatives and the  xxxd990xxx  alcohol bind
cyp2c9 with a high affinity.
6.2.19. other drugs and compounds
mcginnity et al. (2005) [101] examined the inhibitory effect of
14 drugs on the oxidation of two probes for cyp2c9 (diclofenac
and naproxen) in recombinantly expressed cyp2c9 and human
hepatocytes. these drugs included amiodarone, benzbromarone,
 xxxd1732xxx , fluconazole, fluvastatin, ibuprofen, ketoconazole, 4methylimidazole,  xxxd2640xxx , (–)-naproxen,  xxxd2969xxx , quinine,
sulfamethiazole, sulfaphenazole,  xxxd3256xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , warfarin, and  xxxd3545xxx  (fig. (182)). among these compounds, amiodarone and benzbromarone, demonstrated substrate-specific differences, activating naproxen o-demethylation to 250% of control
activity at 1 mm and 1 m, respectively, while inhibiting diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation with ic50 values of 3 and 0.04 m, respectively [101]. potent inhibition of recombinant cyp2c9 was
observed with  xxxd1732xxx , fluvastatin, ketoconazole, and  xxxd3545xxx , with ic50 values of 0.1, 2, 6, and 0.5 m, respectively. on
average, the ic50 values generated using naproxen were 1.5-fold
higher than those determined using diclofenac as a probe. the ic50
values generated in human hepatocytes were much higher than
those determined with recombinant cyp2c9 [101]. after correcting
for non-specific binding, there was an excellent correlation of unbound ic50 values generated in the different milieu.
kumar et al. (2006b) [125] investigated the inhibitory effect of
28 compounds (fig. (183)) which are mostly substrates of cyp2c9
using cyp2c9.1 and cyp2c9.3 with the ile359leu substitution
supersomes on the oxidation of 5 probe substrates of cyp2c9 including s- xxxd2141xxx ,  xxxd990xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , phenytoin, and
diclofenac. they found that the estimated ki value was 1 m for
16 of the 28 inhibitors of  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation in cyp2c9.1,
including benzbromarone (0.001 m),  xxxd2718xxx  (0.01 m),  xxxd2640xxx  (0.01 m), ketoconazole (0.08 m), dapsone (0.09 m),
sulfaphenadine (0.12 m), quercetin (0.25 m), -naphthoflavone
(0.29 m), nifedipine (0.34 m), vivid green (0.53 m), fluvoxamine (0.58 m), omeprazole (0.64 m), tamoxifen (0.66 m),
gemfibrozil (0.79 m),  xxxd2969xxx  (0.92 m), and  xxxd3394xxx  (1.0
m). in contrast, only eight, six, nine, and nine of the inhibitors
exhibited ki values <1 m against s- xxxd2141xxx  hydroxylation,
phenytoin hydroxylation,  xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation, and diclofenac hydroxylation, respectively. an additional eight compounds exhibited ki values between 1 and 10 m toward  xxxd990xxx

hydroxylation, resulting in 24 of 28 compounds exhibiting ki values
<10 m toward this reaction [125].
for the other four probe substrates, the majority of inhibitors
fell within this 1 to 10 m range for the ki values [125]. quinine
was a relatively potent inhibitor of s- xxxd2141xxx  hydroxylation
with a ki of 1.1 m but was a very poor inhibitor of the oxidation of
the other four probe substrates (ki: 20 to >100 m). indomethacin
was a very potent (ki = 0.7 m) inhibitor of  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation but a relatively weak (ki > 10 m) inhibitor of all other probe
substrates. finally, s-ibuprofen was a poor (ki > 40 m) inhibitor
of  xxxd990xxx  hydroxylation but a relatively potent (ki 4 m) inhibitor for other four probe substrates. similar inhibition profiles
were observed with cyp2c9.3, with only two inhibitors showing
more than 3-fold with respect to ki (indomethacin and benzbromarone) [125].
skf525a and its metabolite skf8742 and primary amine analog inhibited cyp2c9 in vitro [1411].  xxxd2779xxx  ii, a cyclindependent kinase inhibitor used as a potential antineoplastic agent,
significantly inhibited cyp2c9 with an ic50 of 39.1 m in vitro
[1412]. dalcetrapib inhibited cyp2c9 moderately in vitro, but it
did not alter the activity of cyp2c9 in vivo [1413].
6.3. natural products and herbal medicines as inhibitors of
cyp2c9
a number of herbal and natural compounds have been found to
inhibit cyp2c9 in vitro [1414]. this causes a potential for herbal
interactions with drugs that are extensively metabolized by
cyp2c9.
6.3.1. curcuminoids
the powdered rhizome of curcuma longa (tumeric), a member
of the ginger family (zingiberaceae), is a popular indian curry spice
used extensively to color and flavor foods. its yellow color is imparted primarily by curcumin (diferuloyl methane, fig. (184)), a
 xxxd1979xxx  pigment of curcuminoids. curcumin has multiple
medicinal benefits including antitumor activity, antiinflammatory
effect, chemoprevention, antioxidation and liver protection [14151419]. the oral absorption of curcumin is low. curcumin is unstable at neutral and basic ph values and is degraded to ferulic acid
([4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid]) and feruloylmethane (4hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl-methane) [1420]. animal studies
have reported that the main metabolites of curcumin in the plasma,
bile and urine were tetrahydrocurcumin and the glucuronide conjugates of curcumin, dihydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin (fig. (184)) [1421]. the major metabolites of curcumin in rat plasma were curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulfate while hexahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcuminol, and hexahydrocurcumin glucuronide were minor products [1422]. the major
metabolites of curcumin in cultured human or rat hepatocytes were
identified as hexahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcuminol [1422].
in human liver microsomes, both curcumin and dimethoxycurcumin
underwent limited metabolism [1423], and cyp2d6 catalyzed the
conversion of curcumin to o-demethyl curcumin [1424].
the other two curcuminoids are desmethoxycurcumin (present
in two forms) and bisdesmethoxycurcumin. zeng et al. (2007)
[1425] recently identified seven new metabolites of demethoxycurcumin, 5-dehydroxy-hexahydro-demethoxycurcumin (m1), 5dehydroxy-hexahydro-demethoxycurcumin (m2), 5-dehydroxyoctahydro-demethoxycurcumin (m3) and 5-dehydroxy-octahydrodemethoxycurcumin (m4), 5-o-methyl-hexahydro-demethoxycurcumin (m7), 5-o-methyl-hexahydro-demethoxycurcumin-b (m8),
and 5-dehydroxy-dihydro-demethoxycurcumin-b (m9), from feces
of rats and from urine (fig. (185) & fig. (186)). the two known
metabolites, hexahydro-demethoxycurcumin (m5) and hexahydrodemethoxycurcumin-b (m6) [1426], were also identified.

fig. (184). metabolism of curcumin. curcumin is unstable at neutral and basic ph values and is degraded to ferulic acid ([4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid])
and feruloylmethane (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl-methane). animal studies have reported that the main metabolites of curcumin in the plasma, bile and
urine were tetrahydrocurcumin and the glucuronide conjugates of curcumin, dihydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin. the major metabolites of curcumin in rat plasma were curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulfate while hexahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcuminol, and hexahydrocurcumin
glucuronide were minor products. the major metabolites of curcumin in cultured human or rat hepatocytes were identified as hexahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcuminol. in human liver microsomes, both curcumin and dimethoxycurcumin underwent limited metabolism, and cyp2d6 catalyzed the conversion of
curcumin to o-demethyl curcumin.

volak et al. (2008) [1427] examined the inhibitory effect of
curcumin and its two analogues on cyp2c9 in vitro. curcuminoid
extracts inhibited cyp2c9 with ic50 of 10.6 m; demethoxycurcumin (ic50 = 8.8 m) was more active against cyp2c9 than either
curcumin (ic50 > 50 m) or bisdemethoxycurcumin [1427].
6.3.2. flavonoids
flavonoids are a diverse group of phytochemicals that are produced by various higher plants including medicinal herbs (e.g. silybum marianum, alpinia officinarum, and hypericum perforatum)
and ingested by humans in food [1428]. flavonoids are structurally
classified into eight groups: flavans, flavanones, isoflavanones,

flavones, isoflavones, anthocyanidines, chalcones and flavonolignans. studies have found that two flavones, luteolin and baicalein,
and one flavonol, quercetin, are potent inhibitors of cyp2c9 [125,
1429-1431]. si et al. (2009) [1432] have recently compared the
inhibitory potency of various flavonols (fig. (187)) and flavones
(fig. (188)) for cyp2c9. the authors found that galangin was the
most potent inhibitor of cyp2c9, with ki of 0.15 m, while the
glucuronidated flavones were weak cyp2c9 inhibitors. in a further
docking study, the competitive inhibitors luteolin, apigenin, baicalein, quercetin and morin bind to the heme and occupy the same
binding site as that of  xxxd2141xxx  in 1r9o [1432]. however, the

generally unaffected by garlic extracts. allicin inhibited cyp2c9
with ic50 of 5.41 m [1230].

6.3.3. garlic

ginkgo ( xxxd2199xxx ) is one of the most popular herbal
medicines in the world, due to its purported and unproven beneficial effects including memory-enhancing, cognition-improving, and
antiplatelet effects [1440-1446]. most clinical studies on efficacy
and safety of ginkgo have been conducted with a standardized
aqueous acetone extract, egb 761 which is in solid form. the primary constituents of ginkgo include flavonoids (e.g. kaempferol
and quercetin), terpenoids (e.g. ginkgolides and bilobalaides), and
organic acids (e.g. ginkgolic acids and alkylphenols) (fig. (189))
[1447-1451]. the latter have been associated with adverse events
such as allergy, induction of neurons, genotoxicity and other toxicities [1451-1455]. thus, ginkgolic acids are restricted in egb 761
to 5 ppm.

garlic (allium sativum), a widely used medicinal herb, is reported to have antimicrobial and immune-enhancing effects [1433,
1434]. it is one of the herbal supplements most commonly used by
hiv-infected patients to improve health and to treat some opportunistic infections [1435]. garlic contains high-level sulfur-containing
compounds (e.g. allicin and alliin), numerous flavinoids/isoflavinoids (such as nobiletin, quercetin, rutin, and tangeretin), polysaccharides, prostaglandins, saponins, and terpenes
(such as citral, geraniol, linalool, and - and -phellandrene) [1436,
1437]. organosulfur compounds in garlic are believed responsible
for its beneficial biological effects, but other compounds, such as sallylcysteine, s-allylmercaptocysteine, and n--fructosyl arginine
may also play a role [1438]. foster et al. (2001) [1439] revealed
that extracts of fresh garlic, and samples of garlic oil, freeze dried
garlic, and aged garlic exhibited an inhibitory effect on cyp2c9,

6.3.4. ginkgo

cyp2c9 with ki of 14 g/ml, cyp1a2 (ki = 106 g/ml),  xxxg589xxx

[1431]. the ic50 of amentoflavone for cyp2c9 was 0.035 m.
ginkgolic acid i and ii inhibited cyp2c9 with ic50 values of 2.41
and 1.94 m, respectively [1230].

henderson et al. (1999) [1463] reported the effects of seven
ginsenosides (rbl, rb2, rc, rd, re, rf, and rgl) and two eleutherosides (b and e) (fig. (190)), all major active components present
in ginseng roots, on the catalytic activity of cdna expressed
cyp1a2, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6 and 3a4 using 96-well plate fluorometrical assay. of the constituents tested, ginsenoside rd showed a
weak inhibitory effect on cyp3a4, 2d6, 2c19 and 2c9, but ginsenoside rc and ginsenoside rf at 200 m resulted in a 70% and
54% increase in the activity of cyp2c9 and 3a4, respectively.

6.3.5. ginseng

milk thistle (silybum marianum) is one of the most commonly
used herbal medicines. it is reported to contain a number of flavonolignans [1464-1466] that are generated in plants by radical
coupling of a flavonoid and a phenylpropanoid. silymarin, a mixture of these flavonolignans isolated from an extract of milk thistle
fruit, is composed of mainly silybin (50-80%), with small amounts
of other flavonolignans such as dehydrosilybin, silychristin and
silydianin (fig. (191)) [1467-1469]. a standardized extract of milk
thistle contains at least 70% silymarin. silybin is primarily conjugated (both glucuronidation and sulfation) and excreted in the bile

ginseng is a widely used herbal medicine due to its purported
anti-hypertensive, anti-fatigue, neuroprotective, antioxidative, chemopreventive, hypolipidemic, cognition-enhancing, immunoenhancing, ulcer-healing, and anticancer effects [1457-1461]. its
major constituents include ginsenosides (panoxosides), sterols,
flavonoids, peptides, vitamins, polyacetylenes, minerals, -elemine,
and choline [1459, 1462]. ginsenosides are considered the major
pharmacologically active constituents, and a number of ginsenosides have been isolated and structurally identified.

and urine in rats [1470] and humans [1471-1474]. silybin
(silibinin, see fig. (168)), the main constituent of silymarin, a flavonoid drug from the milk thistle used in liver disease, competitively inhibited cyp2c9-mediated  xxxd990xxx  7-hydroxylation with
ki of 18 m [1475]. silybin also inhibited cyp1a2 and 2c8 moderately, but showed little inhibition for  xxxg589xxx ,  xxxd577xxx , 2b6, 2c19,
and 2d6 [1327].
in healthy subjects, administration of silymarin 140 mg three
times a day for 14 days increased the auc of losartan but decreased its metabolic ratio in subjects with the cyp2c9*1/*1 genotype, but not in those with the cyp2c9*1/*3 genotype [1476].
silymarin treatment decreased the auc of the active metabolite of
 xxxd358xxx , e-3174, in both cyp2c9*1/*1 and the cyp2c9*1/*3

subjects. these results indicate that silymarin inhibits the metabolism of losartan to e-3174, with the magnitude of the interaction
dependent on the cyp2c9 genotypes.
6.3.7. salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen)
danshen, derived from the dried root or rhizome of salvia
miltiorrhiza, is frequently used in the treatment of angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke [1477, 1478]. danshen and its purified
ingredients are also used to treat hepatitis, menstrual disorders,
miscarriage, and diabetes [1477, 1479]. danshen extracts contain
diterpene quinones, including tanshinone i, dihydrotanshinone,
tanshinone iia, tanshinone iib (fig. (192)), and  xxxd1765xxx ,
and some  xxxd3159xxx  derivatives [1480]. these components have

been reported to have antiplatelet [1481, 1482], cardioprotective
[1483-1485], antiinflammatory [1486], hepatoprotective [1487,
1488], nephroprotective [1489], antimutagenic [1490], and antihiv [1491] effects in preclinical studies. it also has immunomodulating [1492, 1493], antioxidant and radical-scavenging [1494,
1495], antihypertensive [1496], ulcer-healing [1497], antiangiogenic [1498], and anticancer activity [1499, 1500]. recent studies
at our laboratory indicate that  xxxd1765xxx , tanshinone i, tanshinone iia and tanshinone iib are substrates for p-gp [15011504].  xxxd1765xxx , tanshinone iia and tanshinone iib have a
very low oral bioavailability in rats and pigs (<5.0%), probably due
to p-gp-mediated efflux into the gut lumen and first-pass effects
[1501, 1505, 1506]. qiu et al. (2008) [1507] have recently investigated the effect of seven components from salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) including danshensu, protocatechuic aldehyde, protocatechuic
acid, salvianolic acid b, tanshinone i, tanshinone iia, and  xxxd1765xxx  (fig. (192)) on various human cyps. the authors found
that danshensu was a competitive inhibitor of cyp2c9 with ki of
35 m, and  xxxd1765xxx  was a moderate mixed-type inhibitor
of cyp2c9 with ki of 8 m [1507]. in addition, tanshinone i, tanshinone iia, and  xxxd1765xxx  were potent competitive inhibitors of cyp1a2 with ki values of 0.48, 1.0, and 0.45 m, respectively [1507]. three cases have been published reporting enhanced
anticoagulation and bleeding when patients on chronic warfarin
therapy consumed s. miltiorrhiza root [1508]. inhibition of
cyp2c9 may provide partial explanation for this interaction. a rat
study has found that treatment of s. miltiorrhiza root extract (5

g/kg, twice daily) for 3 days followed by a single oral dose of racemic warfarin increased the absorption rate constants, auc, cmax ,
and elimination t1/2 of warfarin, but decreased the clearance and
apparent volume of distribution of both r- and  xxxd990xxx  [1509,
1510]. a similar effect was observed at steady-state levels of warfarin. the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was also potentiated.
6.3.8. st john’s wort
st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum l. a member of the hypericaceae family) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants [1511], which can be bought over-the-counter. st
john’s wort contains over two dozens of constituents, among which
the naphthodianthrones (e.g.  xxxd2308xxx  and pseudohypericin), the
phloroglucinols (e.g.  xxxd2307xxx  and adhyperforin), and a broad
range of flavonoids are the major active components (fig. (193)). it
is well-known that st john's wort extract is a potent inducer of
cyp3a4 and 2b6, and the responsible component was  xxxd2307xxx 
[1512-1514]. however, using cdna-expressed enzymes, st john's
wort extracts and several of its major components (fig. (193)) have
been found to inhibit the activities of cyp1a2, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6,
and 3a4 [1515]. the flavonoid i3,ii8-biapigenin is a potent competitive inhibitor of cyp3a4, 2c9, and 1a2 with ki of 0.038, 0.32,
and 0.95 m, respectively; whereas  xxxd2307xxx  is a competitive
inhibitor of cyp2c9 and 3a4 activities with ki of 1.8 and 0.48 m,
respectively [1515]. however, st john’s wort does not alter the
cyp2c9, 1a2, or 2d6 activities in vivo in humans [1516, 1517].

6.3.9. other natural and herbal compounds
epimedii herbal extracts inhibited cyp2c9 with ic50 of 0.11
mg/ml [1518]. bergamottin and 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin present
in grapefruit juice inhibited cyp2c9 with ic50 values of 0.33 and
1.17 m, respectively [1230]. aescin from horse chestnut and
methysticin from kava kava were moderate inhibitors of cyp2c9,
with ic50 of 24.5 and 16.4 m, respectively. vitexin from
hawthorne, valerenic acid from valerian, and kavain and dihydrokavain from kava kava were all weak inhibitors of cyp2c9 (ic50:
74.2-128.3 m) (fig. (194)) [1230].
oral administration of scutellariae radix extracts three times a
day to healthy subjectsthe decreased the metabolism of losartan by
29% [1519]. administration of s. radix also caused a 1.42-fold
increase in  xxxg589xxx -catalyzed  xxxd1681xxx  metabolic activity.
6.4. structure-inhibition relationship of cyp2c9 inhibitors
hudelson et al. (2008) [1520] recently employed different
models to predict whether a compound would bind to cyp2c9 with

a ki value of <10 m. two of the four methods (line walking recursive partitioning (lwrp) and normal equation recursive partitioning (nerp)) developed partitioning trees based on global descriptions of structure using nine descriptors. a third method (so-called
“gravity method”) used the same descriptors to develop local descriptions that relate activity to structures with similar descriptor
characteristics, while the fourth method (subdue) utilized a
graph-theoretic approach to predict activity based on molecular
structure [1520]. a training set of 276 compounds whose pki values
ranged from 1.9 to 7.6 and a diverse validation set of 50 compounds
(http://www.seeker.wsu.edu, access date: 27 may 2009) were used
to build and evaluate each model. for lwrp, consensus predictions were made using 101 trees based on the entire 276 compound
training set. for nerp, 101 trees were built, but each was based on
a randomly generated subset of 125 compounds from the training
set. for the gravity method, the parameter k = 4 was used. computations for lwrp, nerp, and gravity were all performed using the
2006.08 version of molecular operating environment software.
the modeling methods were chosen to exploit the differences in
how training sets were used to develop the predictive models. an

lwrp predicted 23 correctly. out of 23 compounds that bind with
a ki of over 10 m, 21 were correctly predicted for a specificity of
91%. nerp predicted 45 of the 50 compounds correctly to give a
concordance of 90%. out of the 27 compounds that bind with a k i
value of 10 m or better, nerp predicted 24 correctly. gravity
predicted 43 of the 50 compounds correctly to give a concordance
of 86%; subdue predicted 37 of the 50 compounds correctly to
give a concordance of 74%. overall, lwrp, nerp, gravity, and
subdue predicted that 10 of the 11 compounds had ki values
below 10 m. for the remaining compound, all methods but gravity predicted that the ki would be below 10 m. most of the outliers are found to be relatively close to the 10 m cutoff, indicating
that the methods are capturing the relative affinities of the molecules.
7. implications in drug discovery and drug
development
cyps constitute the most important family of biotransformation
enzymes involved in drug metabolism, playing an important role in
the disposition of drugs and in determining their pharmacological
and toxicological effects. cyp2c9 represents one of the most important enzymes that determine the first-pass elimination of drugs.
the metabolism of drugs by cyp2c9 is polymorphic and this is an
important source of large interindividual variability in drug clearance and drug response. early consideration of adme properties is
increasingly seen as essential for efficient discovery and development of new drugs and drug candidates.
7.1. cyp2c9-mediated drug-drug and herb-drug interactions
and implications in drug development
the cyp2c9 activity ranges considerably within a population
and between individuals. there is a large inter-individual variation
in the enzyme expression and activity of cyp2c9. like other
cyps, cyp2c9 is inducible and inhibited by a number of compounds, and thus both genetic mutations and environmental factors
are largely responsible for the interindividual variation in enzyme
expression and activity. this often presents as a barrier to reaching
optimal therapeutic concentrations. for drugs with cyp2c9 as the
major contributor of clearance (>60%), large differences in auc or
oral clearance were observed.
inhibition of cyp enzymes is one of the most common causes
of harmful drug–drug interactions and has led to the withdrawn of
several marketed drugs during the past decades. the nonsedating
antihistamines terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , for instance, and the
gastrointestinal motility agent  xxxd1708xxx , were all withdrawn from
the u.s. market because metabolic inhibition by other drugs led to
life-threatening arrhythmias [1521]. the calcium channel blocker
 xxxd2638xxx  was withdrawn from the u.s. market in 1998 because it
was a potent mechanism-based enzyme inhibitor that increased the
plasm concentration of other cardiovascular drugs to toxic levels
[1522].
due to frequent pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions by
cyp22c9 inactivators/inhibitors, monitoring of plasma concentrations of concurrently administered drugs that are cyp2c9 substrates and/or have narrow therapeutic indices and observation for
signs of clinical toxicity are always imperative. this will allow
early identification of potential drug-drug interactions and subsequent toxicities.
7.1.1. drug-drug interactions owing to induction of cyp2c9
the recent food and drug administration (fda) draft guidelines (http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/6695dft.pdf, access date:
27 may 2009) suggests that “a drug that produces a change that is
equal to or greater than 40% of the positive control (e.g., rifampin)
can be considered as an enzyme inducer and in vitro and in vivo
evaluation is warranted”. on the basis of these guidelines and clini-

cal drug interaction data, several drugs would be classified as inducers of cyp2c9. cyp2c9 induction is an important source of
drug-drug interactions, which may result in drug toxicity or therapy
failure. a number of clinical studies have documented an increased
clearance of drugs known as cyp2c substrates in patients receiving
rifampicin, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, or a high concentration
of prednisone. phenytoin and carbamazepine may induce cyp2c9mediated drug metabolism [1359].
the systemic clearance of phenytoin [1523],  xxxd3394xxx 
[1524], and  xxxd990xxx  [1525] exhibited a consistent 2- to 3-fold
increase in patients or healthy volunteers receiving rifampin at 450–
1200 mg daily, suggesting clinically significant cyp2c9 induction.
treatment of healthy subjects with rifampin increased the metabolic
clearance of  xxxd2279xxx  had increased about 3-fold and that of
 xxxd3394xxx  more than 2-fold, with significantly shortened elimination half-lives [1524]. rifampin treatment at 600 mg/day for 7 days
to healthy subjects decreased the auc of losartan and e-3174 by
35 and 40%, respectively [1526]. rifampin increased the clearance
of  xxxd3394xxx  1.9-fold regardless of the genotype of cyp2c9 in
healthy subjects [1527]. in addition, rifampin decreased the auc of
 xxxd2215xxx  in healthy volunteers by 39% and the cmax by 22%
[1528]. the elimination half-life of  xxxd2215xxx  was shortened from
2.0 to 1.7 hr by rifampin. rifampin also decreased the auc of
 xxxd2204xxx  by 22% and shortened its half-life from 3.0 to 1.9 hr
[1528]. the induction of losartan metabolism was seen in healthy
subjects treated with rifampin 500 mg daily for 14 days using the
karolinska cocktail [1529]. at steady-state, concomitant rifampin
significantly decreased the exposure to  xxxd358xxx  by 58% in healthy
volunteers [1530]. the induction magnitude of cyp2c9 and other
cyps by rifampicin is clearly sufficient to give rise to clinically
significant interactions with cyp2c9 substrates. in addition, inhibition of  xxxg2163xxx -mediated hepatic uptake of  xxxd358xxx  may also contribute to its interactions with drugs such as cyclosporine, rifampicin, and sildenafil [666].
administration of  xxxd2908xxx  to patients on long-term warfarin treatment decreased the steady-state plasma concentration of
warfarin and diminished its anticoagulant activity [1360], suggestive of induction of  xxxd990xxx  metabolism. a high-dose pentobarbitone therapy in patients with cerebral lesions decreased phenytoin
auc by 73% and increased maximum metabolic velocity of phenytoin by 62% [1531]. the plasma concentration of the principal metabolite of phenytoin, 4’-hpph, was significantly increased after
barbiturate therapy. administration of  xxxd2908xxx  at 100
mg/day for 16 days to healthy subjects decreased the auc of losartan and its metabolite e-3174 by about 20% [1532], probably due to
modest induction of cyp2c9 and 3a4. half-life values of losartan
and e-3174 were not affected.
dexamethasone increased phenytoin clearance in patients
[1533-1535], suggesting a clinically significant induction of
cyp2c9. a patient receiving dexamethasone required a daily
phenytoin dose of greater than 10 mg/kg to maintain the phenytoin
serum concentration within the usual therapeutic range [1536]. the
concentration increased by 300% after dexamethasone was discontinued. in addition, prednisone decreased the half-life of elimination of cyclophosphamide, a drug shown to be a low k m substrate
of cyp2c9 and 2c19, whereas dexamethasone produced an increase in the body clearance of this drug [245, 246]. data on the
interaction of steroids with phenytoin and other cyp2c9 substrates
are limited and conflicting.
the clearances of phenytoin,  xxxd3394xxx  and warfarin, but not
aminopyrine, have been reported to increase in hospitalised alcoholic subjects in the period following ethanol withdrawal [15371539]. in chronic alcoholic subjects, the clearance of  xxxd3394xxx 
clearance was apparently more than 2-fold greater compared with
the control group [1537]. once  xxxd3394xxx  clearance had returned
to normal in alcoholic subjects following prolonged withdrawal, the

3640 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

higher clearance was difficult to reproduce with pure ethanol intake. it is unclear whether the increased clearance of  xxxd3394xxx  is
due to induction of cyp2c9 and other enzymes by ethanol, congenors in alcoholic beverages, or other dietary and lifestyle factors
associated with alcoholism.
overall, there is evidence that several cyp2c9 inducers (e.g.
rifampin and phenobarbital) can induce the clearance of drugs that
are extensively metabolized by cyp2c9 in vivo. the increased
clearance may result in therapeutic failure and thus dosage adjustment may be needed. further studies are needed to identify clinically important drug-drug interactions owing to cyp2c9 induction
in drug development.
7.1.2. drug-drug interactions owing to cyp2c9 inhibition
drug-drug interaction may cause overtreatment and serious side
effects by raising the blood concentration of a drug whose metabolism is inhibited by coadministered drug. cyp2c9 inhibitors may
alter the clearance of drugs that are mainly metabolized by
cyp2c9. a number of clinical studies have been conducted to
investigate the possible interactions of cyp2c9 inhibitors with
drugs that are extensively metabolized by this enzyme.
sulfaphenazole increased the auc of  xxxd3394xxx  5-fold in
humans [1407], and could cause severe hypoglycemic events
[1540]. sulfaphenazole cotreatment reduced the plasma clearance
of  xxxd3394xxx  by 80%. sulfaphenazole cotreatment has been
shown to cause a more than 3-fold prolongation of the half-life of
phenytoin [1541]. furthermore, the auc of  xxxd3394xxx  was increased by 1.6-fold when sulfamethizole was coadministered
[1542]. sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole and sulfadiazine, but not
sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfadimethoxine or sulfamethoxydiazine,
prolonged phenytoin half-life and reduced the clearances of  xxxd3394xxx  and racemic warfarin [1541, 1542]. trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole have increased the plasma concentrations or therapeutic effects of drugs such as  xxxd3394xxx  [1543], phenytoin
[1541], warfarin [1544], and  xxxd2204xxx  [1545]. trimethoprim alone
inhibited the metabolic clearance of  xxxd3394xxx  by 14% and
phenytoin by 30% in humans. inhibition of  xxxg586xxx /9 enzymes is
considered the major mechanism for these drug interactions.
benzbromarone as a most potent cyp2c9 inhibitor has important implication in clinical drug-drug interactions. patients receiving combination therapy of benzbromarone with  xxxd990xxx  experienced increased bleeding events [1357]. such drug interactions may
provide partial explanation for a few cases of hepatotoxicity associated with poor clearance of benzbromarone and its analogs [1546],
such as benziodarone and benzarone [1547]. amiodarone, an analog
of benzbromarone, has been found to decrease the clearance of warfarin in vivo [1345].
numerous case reports have documented enhanced anticoagulant activity of warfarin in patients receiving amiodarone therapy.
in healthy volunteers, pretreatment with amiodarone 400 mg/day
for 3 days decreased the plasma clearances of r- and  xxxd990xxx  by
33 and 47%, respectively [1345]. another study has found that the
oxidation pathways of the warfarin enantiomers, including swarfarin 6- and 7-hydroxylation, were inhibited by amiodarone
[1343]. amiodarone treatment (200 mg/day) increased the auc of
phenytoin by 40% and decreased its clearance by 25.5% in healthy
volunteers [1344]. the 4’-hpph formation was also decreased in
these subjects. since amiodarone has a long half-life (58 days with
a range of 25-100 days; 36 days for the active metabolite
desethylamiodarone), inhibition of cyp2c9 and other cyps (e.g.
2d6 and 3a4) may persist for several weeks after discontinuation
of the drug. in addition, desethylamiodarone is a mechanism-based
inhibitor of cyp2d6 and also inactivates  xxxg575xxx , 1a2, and 2b6
[1346]. thus, amiodarone has a high potential to cause drug interactions by inhibition of cyp2d6.

zhou et al.

skovstead et al. (1976) [1548] investigated the effect of several
coumarins including  xxxd1875xxx ,  xxxd2911xxx , warfarin and  xxxd2905xxx  on the metabolism of phenytoin and  xxxd3394xxx  in patients.  xxxd1875xxx  increased the half-lives of
phenytoin from 8.8 to 37.4 hr and of  xxxd3394xxx  from 4.9 to 17.5.
 xxxd2911xxx  prolonged phenytoin half-life from 9.9 to 14.0 hr
but did not change that of  xxxd3394xxx  [1548]. warfarin and  xxxd2905xxx  did not affect the half-lives of phenytoin and  xxxd3394xxx .
the steady-state concentration of phenytoin was increased by
 xxxd1875xxx  and  xxxd2911xxx , but not warfarin and
 xxxd2905xxx . an increase in plasma  xxxd3394xxx  concentration was
observed during treatment with  xxxd1875xxx  [1548]. these
results suggest that  xxxd1875xxx  inhibits the metabolism of
phenytoin and  xxxd3394xxx  and that  xxxd2911xxx  inhibits phenytoin metabolism only, while warfarin and  xxxd2905xxx  do not affect
the metabolism of phenytoin and  xxxd3394xxx .
a combined use of gemfibrozil and a statin can result in severe
myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [1549-1552]. gemfibrozil has been
found to increase markedly plasma levels of simvastatin acid
[1553], lovastatin acid [1554] and pravastatin [1555], indicating the
involvement of pharmacokinetic components in the gemfibrozilstatin interactions. cotreatment of gemfibrozil has been shown to
increase the auc of rosiglitazone 1.8- to 2.8-fold [1556], auc of
pioglitazone 3.2-fold [893], auc of  xxxd3098xxx  5.5- to 15-fold
[1557, 1558], auc of ibuprofen by 34% [1559], auc of loperamide 2.2-fold [1560], and auc of  xxxd461xxx  1.3- to 10-fold
[891]. however, two other fibrates,  xxxd331xxx  and  xxxd2096xxx  did
not alter the auc of  xxxd3098xxx  [1561]. although gemfibrozil is a
more potent inhibitor for cyp2c9 than 2c8 in vitro [1032, 1369], it
do not alter the plasma concentration of  xxxd990xxx  in healthy subjects, which is mainly metabolized by cyp2c9 [1562]. gemfibrozil
has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2702xxx  in humans [1563], a substrate of cyp2c9 and 3a4. the reason for this
discrepancy is that the glucuronide of gemfibrozil is a potent inhibitor and inactivator of  xxxg586xxx , but not cyp2c9 [892, 1564], and
thus it is not a surprise that gemfibrozil is a selective inhibitor of
 xxxg586xxx  in vivo. recently, the drug interaction effect with  xxxd3098xxx  persisted at least 12 hr after gemfibrozil was administered,
suggesting that the interaction is likely caused by mechanism-based
inhibition of  xxxg586xxx  by gemfibrozil glucuronide [1558].
pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvastatin and diclofenac
has been observed [1402]; while fluvastatin does not alter the
pharmacokinetics of losartan [1565], another cyp2c9 substrate.
on the other hand,  xxxg590xxx  inhibitors do not affect fluvastatin’s
kinetics to the same extent as other  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors
such as simvastatin and lovastatin [1035]. erythromycin, ketoconazole and itraconazole do not alter fluvastatin pharmacokinetics
[1035]. the auc of fluvastatin was increased only 1.9-fold by cyclosporine [1566], probably due to inhibition of both  xxxg590xxx  and
p-gp. fluconazole increased the auc of fluvastatin by 84% and its
elimination half-life by 80% [1567]. however, itraconazole increased the lovastatin auc 20-fold in healthy volunteers [1568].
fluconazole cotreatment at 100–800 mg/day increased the auc
of phenytoin,  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd990xxx  and losartan by 72–75 [1399,
1569], 109 [1399], 184 [1570], and 153% [184, 185], respectively.
kumar et al. (2008) [1571] have found that changes in  xxxd2141xxx 
apparent oral clearance following fluconazole (a prototypical inhibitor of cyp2c9) coadministration were gene dose-dependent in 189
healthy volunteers. the pharmacokinetic of  xxxd2141xxx  was no
altered by fluconazole in cyp2c9*3/*3 subjects. analysis of fractional clearances suggested that the fraction metabolized by
cyp2c9, as influenced by genotype, determined the degree of drug
interaction observed. the apparent oral clearance of  xxxd2141xxx 
differed significantly among the three genotype groups (*1/1, *1/3,
and *3/3) at baseline but not after pretreatment with 400 mg of fluconazole for 7 days [1571].

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

7.1.3. herb-drug interactions owing to modulation of cyp2c9
herbs are often administered in combination with therapeutic
drugs, raising the potential of pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic herb-drug interactions. combined use of herbs with drugs
may mimic, increase, or reduce the effects of either component,
resulting in important herb-drug interactions [987, 1572]. pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions are caused due to altered absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of drugs. the underlying mechanisms for the altered drug concentrations by concomitant
herbal medicines are frequently unknown, but the induction or inhibition of hepatic and intestinal drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g.
cyp3a4 and 2c9 and/or drug transporters such as p-gp [1573]
have been implicated. a number of herb-drug interactions with
clinical significance have been reported, many of them from case
reports and limited clinical observations [987]. of the reported
drugs that interact with herbs in humans, about 80% are substrates
for various cyps, in particular, cyp3a4 and 2c9 [1574, 1575].
two case reports have suggested the combination of warfarin
and garlic extract caused an increase of clotting time [1576, 1577].
the additive effect is considered to be due to that some garlic components have anticoagulant effect instead of pharmacokinetic
modulation, and thus enhanced the effect of warfarin. in a recent
human study, coadministration of garlic extracts for 14 days did not
significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effect of
warfarin [1578]. garlic may enhance the effect of hypoglycaemic
drugs. a woman taking a curry containing garlic and karela (momordica charantia) while on  xxxd1678xxx  (a cyp2c9 substrate)
therapy experienced enhanced hypoglycemic response [1579]. garlic extracts have been known to produce hypoglycemic effects in
humans [1580, 1581], providing an explanation for garlicchlorpropamide interaction.
ginkgo may interact with warfarin, as a few case reports associated concomitant use of ginkgo extract with warfarin with the
development of intracerebral haemorrhage [1582, 1583]. there is
case report on spontaneous hyphema when ginkgo extract is combined with aspirin [1584]. additionally, there is a case report on
fatal intracerebral mass bleeding associated with the combined use
of ginkgo extract and ibuprofen [1585]. however, a recently published randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover
study indicated that oral ingestion of g. biloba extract 100 mg daily
for 4 weeks did not alter the clotting time in danish outpatients on
stable, long-term warfarin treatment, and the mean dosage of warfarin did not change during the treatment [1586].
the interaction between st john’s wort and warfarin had been
identified from spontaneous case reports [1587, 1588]. concomitant
intake of st john’s wort was associated with loss of anticoagulant
activity in patients stabilized on warfarin. although no thromboembolic episodes occurred, the decrease in anticoagulant activity was
considered clinically significant. anticoagulant activity was restored when st john’s wort was terminated or the warfarin dose was
increased. in a cross-over study, healthy volunteers taking st john’s
wort 900 mg daily for 11 days before a single dose of  xxxd2911xxx  (a cyp2c9 substrate) had a lower auc of the free fraction
than when they received the placebo [1589]. these observations
suggest increased clearance of both warfarin and  xxxd2911xxx ,
possibly due to the induction of cy2c9 and 3a4. both warfarin
and  xxxd2911xxx  are extensively metabolized by cyp2c9 [61].
 xxxd2202xxx  is an oral hypoglycemic sulfonylurea that can restore
first peak of insulin secretion and increase insulin sensitivity [988].
cyp2c9 is the major contributor to  xxxd2202xxx  metabolic clearance,
although cyp2c19 may also be involved [992]. st john’s wort
significantly altered  xxxd2202xxx  pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. the auc of  xxxd2202xxx  was decreased by 33% and oral clearance increased by 50% after st john’s wort treatment. st john’s
wort decreased the elimination half-life of  xxxd2202xxx  by 15%
[1590]. there were no significant changes in glucose or insulin

current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

3641

auc after st john’s wort treatment and no significant differences
according to cyp2c9 genotype [1590]. these findings indicate that
st john’s wort significantly increases the clearance of  xxxd2202xxx ,
independent of cyp2c9 genotype. diabetes patients should be
closely monitored to evaluate possible signs of reduced efficacy of
 xxxd2202xxx  in combination with st john’s wort. however, st john’s
wort treatment at 900 mg for 2 weeks did not alter the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3394xxx , a probe substrate of cyp2c9 [1591]. when
the participants received low- xxxd2307xxx  st john’s wort (esbericum
capsules containing 240 mg extract and 3.5 mg  xxxd2307xxx ), the
auc of  xxxd3394xxx  was only marginally (<12%) influenced by
esbericum capsules [1592]. it appears the interaction of st john’s
wort with cyp2c9 substrates is substrate-dependent.
identification of herb-drug interactions and the underlying
mechanisms has important implications in drug discovery and development [1575]. since herb-drug combinations are often encountered in clinical practice and herb-drug interactions have important
clinical and toxicological implications, a proper design of drugs that
have minimal potential for herbal interaction has important implications in drug development [1574]. it appears that the chemical
properties of a drug critical for herbal interaction include: a) being a
cyp substrate; b) being a p-gp substrate, and c) preponderance of
cyp inducers and/or inhibitors. thus, any newly developed drugs
which are identified to be cyp and/or p-gp substrates have a potential for interactions with commonly used herbs.
a possible approach to overcoming unfavourable drug interactions with herbal remedies is to design new drugs that are so-called
“hard drugs” which are not or minimally metabolized by cyps
and/or not transported by p-gp [1574]. the concept of “hard drugs”
was first proposed by ariens (1972) [1593]. these drugs are nonmetabolizable, excreted through either the bile or kidney with simple kinetics. thus, their pharmacokinetics is simplified and, usually,
is predictable. when these drugs are administered, the potential for
interactions with combined herbal remedies will be greatly reduced.
for new drug application, its potential for cyp interactions is
needed by fda and subsequently in vitro drug-drug and drug-cyp
interaction studies have been incorporated into drug development.
given that herb-drug interactions in humans are increasingly reported and fatal events are possible, studies on herb-drug, herbcyp and herb-p-gp interactions should also be included and implemented at the early stage of drug development. with the current
techniques, it is increasingly possible to identify drugs that are
highly likely to interact with herbs. by screening drug candidates
for possible interactions with cyps such as cyp2c9 and 3a4 and
p-gp, it is possible to identify and eliminate such chemicals at early
stages of development.
if the drugs have to be used in combination with herbal remedies, in some instances rational use of such drugs becomes necessary, including the use of a safe drug combination regimen, dose
adjustment, and discontinuation of therapy when toxic herb-drug
interactions occur. when herbs are combined with drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, the monitoring of plasma drug concentrations and observing of potential toxicities should be conducted.
predicting the risks for potential herb-drug interactions following
proper pharmacokinetic principles that are used for predicting drugdrug interactions and in vitro–in vivo extrapolation is likely, but the
nature of herbal remedies confounds the prediction [1575].
7.2. polymorphic cyp2c9-mediated drug metabolism and
drug development
the metabolism of drugs by cyp2c9 is polymorphic. to date,
more than 33 variants and a series of subvariants of cyp2c9 (*1b
through to *34) have been identified (http://www.imm.ki.se/ cypalleles, access date: 27 may 2009). cyp2c9*1a is referred to the
wild-type. there have been 520 snps found in the cyp2c9 upstream sequence, introns and 9 exons in ncbi dbsnp

3642 current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, access date: 27 may 2009). among
these snps, there are 19 non-synonymous snps found in exons 3,
5, 7, 8, and 9. some of these alleles and snps have been associated
with altered drug clearance and drug response.
cyp2c9*2 is the first identified and most common allelic variant of cyp2c9, a missense mutation of 430t>c causing the
arg144cys substitution [69]. substitution of amino acids at residue
144 in cyp2c9*2 interfered with normal interaction between cytochrome p450 and nadph: cytochrome p450 oxido-reductase.
cyp2c9*3 is a missense mutation of 1075a>c on exon 7 that
leads to an ile359leu substitution [1594]. cyp2c9*2 causes ~2030% loss of enzyme activity toward s-naproxen, whereas the *3
mutation may reduce vmax activity by up to 95%. cyp2c9*4 is an
extremely rare missense mutation of 1076t>c originally identified
in a japanese epileptic patient with an adverse reaction to phenytoin
[1595]. the cyp2c9*5 allele contains the 1080c>g transversion in
exon 7 causing an asp360glu change, which has been found almost
exclusively in african-americans [1596-1598]. cyp2c9*6 is a null
allele because of deletion of a at 818 nucleotide on exon 5 originally identified in an african-american patient with a high sensitivity to phenytoin, which results in a shortened protein [1598, 1599].
the cyp2c9*11 allele was identified in a patient who was highly
sensitive to  xxxd59xxx , and carried a single cyp2c9*3 allele
[1600]. in addition, cyp2c9*13 has been identified in a chinese
poor metabolizer of  xxxd2508xxx  and the allele has a 269t>c transversion in exon 2 of cyp2c9 that leads to a leu90pro substitution
[796]. moreover, a number of rare alleles of cyp2c9 (*14 through
*34) have been reported.
there are significant ethnic differences in the frequency of
cyp2c9 variants. for example, cyp2c9*2 is reasonably frequent
among caucasians with 1% of the population being homozygous
carriers and a significant 22% are heterozygous [1594]. the corresponding figures for the cyp2c9*3 allele are 0.4% and 15%; with
another 1.4% being compound heterozygotes – cyp2c9*2*3 [385].
cyp2c9*5 is estimated to be inherited in ~3% of the africanamerican population as a single allele mutation of 1080c>g [1597,
1598]. in addition, african-americans have a significantly lower
rate of cyp2c9*2 and *3 inheritance than caucasians, with 2.5%
and 1.25% frequency, respectively.
there are a number of clinical studies that address the impact of
cyp2c9 polymorphisms on the clearance and/or therapeutic response of drugs that are substrates of cyp2c9. the drugs most
extensively studied include coumarin anticoagulants, sulfonylurea
drugs,  xxxg99xxx  inhibitors, phenytoin, and nsaids. for example, a homozygous individual for the cyp2c9*3 allele was found to
have a reduction in clearance of  xxxd990xxx  and an exacerbated
response to warfarin, thus the *3/*3 genotype was clearly shown to
be linked to warfarin sensitivity [1601-1604]. a strong association
has been demonstrated between the presence of one or more
cyp2c9*2 and *3 variant alleles and low-dose requirements for
warfarin in a large number of published studies, whereas in most
cases the dose is lowest if cyp2c9*3 is present [1602, 1605]. in
addition, individuals heterozygous and homozygous for cyp2c9*3
had 2- and 6-fold higher auc of  xxxd3394xxx  than subjects carrying
the wild-type gene [13, 1017].
7.3. in silico studies of cyp2c9 and drug development
there is an increasing use of in silico methods to study
cyp2c9 and its interactions with substrates and inhibitors (see
section 3.1). the major in silico methods include simple rule-based
modeling, sars, 3d-qsar, homology modeling, and pharmacophores [1606]. all represent useful tools for understanding reactions catalyzed by cyp2c9, and the developed models have been
used to predict potential drug-drug interactions, and other important
parameters such as km, ki and clearance. the resulting data based
on in silico approaches may be of significance in drug development.

zhou et al.

in particular, knowledge of binding affinity of novel drugs to
cyp2c9 is essential, as this will provide information on the possible drug interactions.
the use of computational techniques will add chemical knowledge to the empirical data obtained with in vitro systems and enable
the prediction of substrates or inhibitors of cyp2c9 through computer-based models. the predictions by means of a rapid in silico
screen might be useful as a drug interaction screen, and assist medicinal chemists understanding potential inhibitors for cyp2c9 in
the use of therapeutics and making necessary chemical modifications in the drug discovery and lead optimization processes. for
example, ahlstrom et al. (2007) [827, 828] have examined the inhibitory potency of 13 newly synthesized celecoxib analogues
against cyp2c9 using the 1r9o and cox-2 structures (fig. (98)).
a combined use of the structural information gained from the docking studies is useful to design pharmacologically active cox-2
inhibitors with improved metabolic properties and binding affinity
to cox-2.
in silico screening of potential ligands for cyp2c9 can be performed in two fundamental ways: ligand-based and protein-based
manner. combinations of protein- and ligand-based methods have
often been used. for the ligand-based method, molecular descriptors extract information from a set of cyp2c9 ligands to build a
model (e.g. qsar or pharmacophore model) that provides rules to
classify other chemicals as potential cyp2c9 ligands and is validated by another set of known cyp ligands. alleged pharmacophore is a hypothesis representing generalized molecular features
including 3d (hydrophobic groups, charged/ionizable groups, and
hydrogen bond donor/acceptors), 2d (substructures), and 1d
(physical and biological properties) aspects that are considered to
be responsible for a desired activity [1607]. in the protein-based
approach, candidate ligands are docked into the crystal structure or
a homology model of cyp2c9, and the estimated low free energy
of binding and inhibition constant (km or ki) will be calculated for
the evaluation of binding affinity and inhibitory potency for 2c9.
for example, yasuo et al. (2009) [95] have recently developed a
comfa model for cyp2c9 using a series of inhibitors and this
model gave an accurate prediction of ki values when compared to
data from experimental studies.
the available x-ray structures of cyp2c9 [30, 80] enable us to
more generally discuss the bound conformations of various substrates and inhibitors, regardless of the similarity in their chemical
structures. if the conformations and orientations of ligands in the
binding pockets in cyp2c9 are determined correctly by computational techniques with those x-ray structures, an appropriate set of
the aligned molecules could be gained, which would lead to a predictive 3d-qsar model for cyp2c9 inhibition.
8. conclusions
cyp2c9 is one of the most abundant cyp enzymes in the human liver (20% of hepatic total cyp content). cyp2c9 metabolizes approximately 15% clinical drugs (>100 drugs), including a
number of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges. some natural
compounds are also metabolized, probably leading to the formation
of toxic metabolites. cyp2c9 also plays a role in the metabolism of
several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and  xxxd208xxx . cyp2c9 is subject to induction and
inhibition by a number of compounds and this may provide an explanation for some important drug-drug interactions. several nuclear receptors, including  xxxg1598xxx , car, and gr are involved in the
regulation of cyp2c9.
by incorporating genotyping and phenotyping information on
cyp2c9, health professionals can identify the patient’s polymorphisms and disease subtypes to determine most advantageous management. this can include the immediate administration of the most

substrates, inducers and inhibitors of cyp2c9

efficacious and least toxic drugs at the correct doses. understanding
and identifying an individual’s genetic variations has the potential
to decrease both the time expended in achieving effective therapy
and the number of visits required for proper dose adjustment
[1608].
the structure of human cyp2c9 has been determined and
shows the characteristic cyp fold as observed in other cyps but
with remarkable differences compared to other cyps. this will
help in determining the structural factors that govern its substrate
specificity and inhibitor selectivity. the utility of predicting the
ability of a compound to inhibit cyp2c9 early in drug development
would greatly increase the efficiency of screening drug interactions
owing to cyp2c9 inhibition. however, the detailed biochemical
mechanisms for ligand-cyp2c9 interactions are not fully elucidated. further studies are needed to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the function and regulation of cyp2c9 and factors that determine the interactions of ligands with 2c9.
in silico screening is possible to identify high-affinity ligands
for cyp2c9. although it is a virtual screening system, in silico
study could provide some early prediction of the possible involvement of cyp2c9 in the metabolism of drugs or drug candidates,
not only improving drug safety but also contributing to make drug
design more effective and less cost. available crystal structures of
human cyp2c9 have provided important functional information of
this protein and are very useful for further in silico studies.
cyp2c9 is subject to induction and inhibition by many compounds and drugs and this may provide an explanation for some
clinical drug-drug interactions. inhibition of cyp2c9 activity can
reduce metabolism and elimination of the drugs that are subject to
first-pass metabolism and lead to increased bioavailability and even
toxicity of these compounds, especial for those extensively metabolized mainly by cyp2c9. for example, fluconazole, a potent inhibitor of cyp2c9, reduced approximately 70% of metabolic clearance of  xxxd990xxx , leading to significant bleeding at clinical setting
[1609]. with regard to prodrugs that need cyp2c9 for activation,
inhibition of cyp2c9 may cause a decrease in the amount of the
active metabolite, leading to therapeutic failure. for example, tamoxifen could significantly reduce the conversion of prodrug losartan to its active form e-3174 by inhibiting cyp2c9 activity in
breast cancer patients [1610].

current medicinal chemistry, 2009 vol. 16, no. 27

3643

estimated 15-20% of clinical drugs are metabolized at least in part
by cyp2c9. the primarily hepatic expression of this enzyme governs the first-pass metabolism of many orally administered drugs.
since the data on the safety of a new drug candidate is often scant,
it is beneficial to limit the contribution of polymorphic enzymes
such as cyp2c9 below some cut-off to avoid the requirement of
phenotyping/genotyping testing before the commencement of drug
treatment and different dosing regimens in poor and extensive metabolizing subjects.
cyp2c9 has an important role in drug development and it is a
common practice for pharmaceutical industry nowadays to a great
extent screen drug candidates early in development as possible
cyp2c9 substrates and drop such candidates where they have alternatives. this candidate selection might eventually lead to a less
prominent role of this enzyme in the future for drug metabolism and
minimize the potential for significant polymorphic metabolism in
humans and drug-drug interactions when used in combination with
cyp2c9 inhibitors or inducers.

analysis

the most common drug-drug interactions are associated with
alterations in drug clearance, primarily due to inhibition of cyps.
identification of drug-drug interaction potential early in drug discovery and development is important because drug-drug interactions can cause life-threatening changes in drug concentrations in
the body. given that cyp2c9 plays such an important role in drug
metabolism and binds a number of compounds with high affinity, it
is not surprising that drug-drug interactions can occur for compounds metabolized by this enzyme. early discovery of potential
drug-drug interactions for a compound expedites the decision to
eliminate that compound from consideration, thus lowering the cost
of drug discovery. virtual drug screening allows for the prediction
of binding affinity prior to synthesis, and if prediction can be
trusted, it can guide the drug discovery process. the general rule for
drug-drug interactions is that compounds that have ki values, uncorrected for protein binding, greater than 10 m are unlikely to
cause important clinical drug-drug interactions. since most compounds have ki values higher than 10 m, including estimates of
drug affinity in the early stages of drug design should reduce drugdrug interactions, while not significantly limiting the library of lead
compounds for a given therapeutic target.
