[investigation of neuromuscular blocking agents at richter ltd].  investigation of new neuromuscular blocking agents was started 30 years ago in richter ltd. this paper presents the results obtained by richter's scientists. 2 compounds out of 100 bisquaternary ammonio steroid having androstane skeleton were selected for further pharmacological study. one of these agents,  xxxd2959xxx  bromide ( xxxd2959xxx ) elicited long-lasting block of neuromuscular transmission without cardiovascular side effects in both animal experiments and clinical studies.  xxxd2959xxx  is a powerful competitive antagonist of acetylcholine, since it can bind pre- and postsynaptic (n1) receptors of the transmitters. it has no remarkable cumulative effect. neostigmine rapidly and completely antagonized the neuromuscular blockade caused by  xxxd2959xxx .  xxxd2959xxx  was introduced into clinical practice. the second compound, rgh-4201 (duador) evoked a neuromuscular block of short duration. it showed slight atropin-like cardio-vagolytic effect in animal experiments. in the clinical studies, however, the cardiovascular side effects were found to be too strong. therefore, it was not introduced in clinical practice.
