abstract: at present the only fda-approved therapy for alzheimer’s disease involves the administration of
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, to alleviate the cholinergic deficit associated with this disease. however, none of the
approved drugs is ideal in efficacy or tolerability. one possible strategy to improve selectivity and potency is to design
drugs that can simultaneously bind to the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of ache. in this review we will describe
the development of dimeric ache inhibitors, from the early observations of high inhibition potency by bis-quaternary
inhibitors, to the structure-based design of dimers based on tacrine,  xxxd2287xxx , galanthamine, and polyamines.

alzheimer’s memory loss

alzheimer’s disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a loss of basal forebrain neurons and
reduced cortical and hippocampal levels of acetylcholine
(ach). although the precise etiology of ad is unknown,
onset and progression of the disease are associated with
extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid plaques and intracellular deposition of neurofibrillary tangles [1]. intervention in
these protein deposition processes could provide the basis for
future preventive or curative treatments. however a useful
intermediate goal is to ameliorate the learning and memory
deficits resulting from the associated ach depletion [2]. a
number of strategies to address the cholinergic deficit can be
envisioned, but to date only the administration of reversible
acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitors has provided success
in clinical practice. some well-known reversible ache
inhibitors are listed in scheme 1.
tacrine [3] was the first drug approved in the united
states for the palliative treatment of ad, but the poor
selectivity of this drug for ache results in a number of
undesired side effects [4]. in the intervening years, e2020
[5], galanthamine [6], and rivastigmine [7] were approved
for the treatment of ad in the united states, europe, and
australia. (-)- xxxd2287xxx  [8-10] is a selective ache
inhibitor isolated from the chinese medicinal herb huperzia
serrata, and is used in china for the palliative treatment of
ad. it is safe to say however, that none of these drugs has
proven ideal either in efficacy or tolerability. these shortcomings, as well as a tantalizing early report that blockage of
the peripheral site of ache inhibits beta-amyloid aggregation
[11], inspired the development of dimeric inhibitors that
span the catalytic and peripheral sites of the enzyme.

up to the peripheral site [14], we will not discuss drug
development around this pharmacophore, since dual-site
binding was not a driving force in its design. we will close
with the use of “click chemistry” to enable electrophorus
electricus ache to synthesize its own 99 fm heterodimeric
inhibitor, and the possible use of dimeric inhibitors to inhibit
beta-amyloid aggregation.
2. historical development of dimeric
ache inhibitors: bis- (and tris)-quaternaries
in the first half of the 20th century a number of bisquaternary amines were found to have the curariform activity
of d- xxxd3456xxx  (scheme 2) [15].

scheme 2. selected bis- (and tris)-quaternary inhibitors of ache.

paton and zaimis [16] and bergmann [17] were among
the first to relate the physiological effects of d- xxxd3456xxx 
and  xxxd1820xxx  to specific modes of pharmacological
action, including ache inhibition. bergmann subsequently
demonstrated that  xxxd1820xxx  was 1800-fold more
potent than  xxxd3337xxx  for inhibiting acetylcholinesterase [18]. these results prompted the speculation that
acetylcholinesterase, unlike  xxxg248xxx , possessed
two anionic sites, though at this point the locus of the second
site was not clear. during the subsequent twenty years a
number of other bis- (and tris)-quaternary compounds were
found to be potent inhibitors of ache, including bw284c51
[19],  xxxd137xxx  [20-22], dap [23, 24],  xxxd2174xxx  [25],
and the phenanthridinium derivatives  xxxd3027xxx  [26] and
decidium [27]. fluorescence studies proved useful for
characterizing competitive binding to the active [23, 24, 26]
and peripheral sites [26], and taylor’s 1975 study on
torpedo californica ache (tcache) demonstrated that
 xxxd3027xxx  bound selectively to the peripheral site, but
 xxxd1820xxx , dap, and  xxxd137xxx  bound to the active
site and peripheral sites with similarly high affinities [26].
although the authors were careful not to claim proof, the
clear inference from this study was that bis-quaternary
ligands featuring an intercharge distance of ~14å simultaneously occupy (and thus span) these two sites [26]. a
subsequent tcache fluorescence study with decidium
suggested that this ligand could also span both the active and
peripheral sites, as consequence of the long intercharge
separation [27].
landmark crystallographic studies of tcache by
sussman et al. in the early 1990s finally provided a
convincing structural explanation for the potency of bisquaternary ache inhibitors, and a foundation for structurebased drug design [28, 29]. the catalytic site of ache was
found to be located at the bottom of a deep and narrow
cavity, called the “aromatic gorge” since 40% of the surface
of the gorge is lined with the rings of 14 conserved aromatic
amino acid residues [28]. the so-called “anionic subsite” of
the catalytic site was void of anionic groups; this result was
unexpected in view of the extremely high catalytic efficacy
of ache. instead of aspartic or  xxxd2431xxx , two aromatic
amino acids, w84 and f330 were found to be present at the
catalytic anionic site. the so-called “peripheral anionic site”
was similarly found to consist of aromatic amino acids
w279, y70, and f290, located at the opening of the mouth
of the active site gorge. the 1993 structure of the  xxxd1820xxx  complex of tcache [29] demonstrated that the
ligand had close contacts with the enzyme both at the
catalytic anionic site (w84) and at the mouth of the active
site gorge (w279), thus providing one of the first examples
of the importance of the cation-pi effect in biology [30]. in
contrast, tacrine was shown to bind only at the active site
[29]. following these pivotal studies, a number of other
inhibitors have been co-crystallized with tcache or murine
ache (mache), including (-)- xxxd2287xxx  [31], e2020 [14],
galanthamine [32], bw284c51 [33],  xxxd2174xxx  [34],  xxxd3027xxx  [34], and decidium [34]. however, the details of these
enzyme•inhibitor structures will not be discussed at this
point, since the first rationally-designed blood-brain penetrable dimeric ache inhibitors preceded these structures.

as described above for ache, and as portoghese subsequently demonstrated for opioid receptors [35-37], dimeric
ligands can display significant enhancements in binding
potency and selectivity relative to their monomeric counterparts. the relationship of this phenomenon to the familiar
“chelate effect” of inorganic chemistry has been long
appreciated, and in 1981 jencks provided an early theoretical
treatment of dual-site binding [38]. based on the inhibition
profiles of the bis-quaternary ache inhibitors described
above, it seems likely that dimerization might prove an
effective strategy for development of a clinically effective
and tolerable drug for the treatment of alzheimer’s memory
loss. quaternary amine compounds, however, do not cross
the blood-brain barrier, and thus the published bis-quaternaries described above could not be used in cholinergic
replacement therapy for alzheimer’s memory loss. but as
early as 1992 rosenberry suggested that a bis-tertiary amine
such as di(desethyl)  xxxd137xxx  could be blood-brain barrier
penetrable, and potentially useful as a therapeutic agent [22].
3. structure-based design of
dimers and analogous dimers

tacrine

in this context, rational design of the first blood-brain
barrier penetrable dimeric ache inhibitor was carried out by
pang. determination of the tcache x-ray structure [28, 29]
allowed docking studies with inhibitors to be performed, and
in 1994, pang identified a putative peripheral binding site for
tacrine near w279, y70, and f290 [39]. pang further proposed that the affinity of tacrine for the peripheral site was
low, to explain why x-ray crystallography did not evidence
binding of tacrine to the peripheral site [29]. based on the
computed distance between the catalytic and peripheral
binding sites in ache, pang prepared alkylene-linked tacrine
dimers (bis(n)-tacrines, 1f-i) (scheme 3), and evaluated them
for ache and  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) inhibition in
vitro (rat) [40, 41].
the pharmacological data obtained provide remarkable
vindication of the computational prediction. computation

predicted an optimum tether length of 9 methylenes for
tcache, and for rat ache the optimum tether length proved
to be 7 methylenes: bis(7)-tacrine (1f) was 1000-fold more
potent than tacrine for inhibiting ache. dimerization also
achieved the related goal of improved ache/ xxxg248xxx 
selectivity. the isozyme  xxxg248xxx  possesses nonaromatic
residues a279, n70, and q121 in place of the corresponding
aromatic residues in ache, and since these residues cannot
effectively interact with a cationic protonated tacrine,
dimerization should not improve affinity for  xxxg248xxx . thus, as
predicted, dimerization of tacrine not only increased ache
inhibition potency, but also improved ache/ xxxg248xxx 
inhibition selectivity nearly 10,000-fold [40, 41].
to probe the specificity of the ache peripheral site, a
series of tacrine heterodimers (2c-i) was prepared with a
neutral hydrophobic benzene ring in place of the cationic,
protonated tacrine unit (scheme 3). enzyme inhibition by
this class showed that compound (2g) was optimal, and
further decrease or increase of chain length weakened ache
inhibition and lowered ache/ xxxg248xxx  selectivity. this result
confirmed that the chain length of tacrine-aromatic heterodimeric analogs was an important determinant of potency
and selectivity. however, since the inhibition potency of
bis(7)-tacrine (1f) was 500-fold greater than that of 2g, it
appeared that the ache peripheral site only weakly bound
hydrophobic aromatics [40].
following the initial publications by pang on tacrine
dimers [40, 41], work on these and related dimers proceeded
in the context of a collaboration between pang, carlier, and
han. in pang’s study with a small series of tacrine dimers 1fi, heptylene-linked dimer bis(7)-tacrine (1f) had the highest
anti-ache potency. however, the question remained, do
seven methylenes provide the optimum tether length for
ache inhibition? demonstration that 1f is superior to
homologous ‘short-tether’ tacrine dimers (i.e. bis(n)-tacrine,
n<7) is important not only from the perspective of drug
development, but as a further physical test of the dual
binding site hypothesis. if simultaneous binding to the

ache and  xxxg248xxx  inhibition assays of 1a-i confirmed that
a seven methylene tether (1f) indeed optimizes both ache
inhibition potency and ache/ xxxg248xxx  selectivity, consistent
with earlier projections (fig. 1).

catalytic and peripheral sites is indeed responsible for the
enhanced ache inhibition potency of 1f, there should be a
well-defined minimum tether length, beyond which dual-site
binding is impossible and ache ic50 rises dramatically.
thus we undertook the synthesis of short-tether homologs
bis(2)-tacrine to bis(6)-tacrine (1a-e) [42]. application of the
previously developed alkylation method [41] to the synthesis
of desired homologs (1a-e) was not successful owing to
competing cyclization and elimination processes with br(ch2)n-br (n = 2 to 6) [42]. we then developed a nucleophilic
aromatic substitution route, which proved both convenient
and versatile (scheme 4).

bis(7)-tacrine (1f) had an ic50 value of 1.5 ± 0.1 nm,
nearly 150-fold lower than that of tacrine [42]; note that this
potency enhancement, while quite significant, is somewhat
less than first reported by pang [40]. bis(n)-tacrines (1) are
significantly more potent than tacrine at ache until n = 3-4,
at which point the dimers approximate the tacrine monomer
in potency. this observation is consistent with the expectation that at some point, the tether will be too short, permitting only single site binding to ache. finally, bis(2)-tacrine
(1a) has roughly 1/3 the potency of tacrine; this loss of
potency could be due to crowding at the bottom of the ache
gorge, as a consequence of the close proximity of the two
tacrine units. in contrast to the dramatic tether length
dependence for ache inhibition, inhibition of  xxxg248xxx  is
rather insensitive to tether-length, and none of the dimers are

gave the desired dimers (1a-i) in good yield [42].

more potent than tacrine for inhibiting  xxxg248xxx  (fig. 1). this
result is consistent with the fact that  xxxg248xxx , unlike ache has
only one cation-binding domain. thus, as expected tacrine
dimerization did not provide any advantage for  xxxg248xxx 
inhibition.
bis(7)-tacrine (1f) was subsequently evaluated in several
ex vivo and in vivo rat models. in rat cortex or whole brain,
30 minutes after a single oral administration, 1f is 10-fold
more potent for ache inhibition than tacrine [43]. furthermore, at doses of 1f and tacrine that afford equivalent ache
inhibition, 1f exhibits significantly reduced serum  xxxg248xxx 
inhibition [43]. dimer 1f also exhibits 24-fold greater potency
than tacrine for reversing scopolamine-induced memory
impairments in the standard morris water maze [44]. finally,
1f was shown to dose-dependently reverse af64a-induced
learning deficits in the morris water maze [45]. these results
clearly show that 1f penetrates the blood-brain barrier, and
suggest that it might be a promising candidate for treatment
of alzheimer’s memory loss.
however since the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites
on ache are not identical, it seemed unlikely that the
symmetrical tacrine dimer 1f would prove to be the optimum
drug. to understand the structural determinants of binding at
the peripheral site we therefore expanded pang’s original
study [40] by preparing four additional classes of tacrine
heterodimers [46]. these new heterodimers feature stepwise
mutation of one inhibitor unit from tacrine to a simple amino
group (scheme 5). such heterodimers will be useful for
assessing the complementary roles that cation-pi and
hydrophobic interactions have on peripheral site affinity. it is
worth noting that such heterodimers might also be useful
molecular probes in other systems: similar homodimeric
drugs have previously been valuated as k+ channel [47] and
nmda receptor [48, 49] blockers.

the desired heterodimeric inhibitors were synthesized by
modification of the route we developed previously for the
synthesis of tacrine dimers (1) (scheme 4) [42]. combination of 9-chloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (4) with 3 equiv
of the desired  xxxd3043xxx  in refluxing 1-pentanol provided
amino-tacrine heterodimers (5) in good yield. subsequent
eschweiler-clarke methylation provided dimethylaminotacrine heterodimers (6). treatment of 5 with 2 equiv of 4bromopyridine in refluxing 1-pentanol provided  xxxd1804xxx -tacrine heterodimers (7). finally, reaction of 5 with
4-chloroquinoline gave 4-aminoquinoline-tacrine heterodimers (8).
ache inhibition studies of these four classes of tacrine
heterodimers revealed that all four series show tether lengthdependent ache inhibition potency and selectivity enhancements relative to tacrine, suggesting dual-site binding to
ache. in contrast, the heterodimers are uniformly less
potent than tacrine at  xxxg248xxx , consistent with the absence of a
peripheral cation-binding domain on this enzyme. the best
members from each series are described in table 1.
in the amino-tacrine heterodimers (5), optimal ache
inhibition potency is provided by an 8-methylene tether (5g).
in the dimethylamino-tacrine heterodimers (6), tethers of 7
(6f), 8 (6g), and 10 (6i) methylenes provide nearly identical
ache ic50 values that are significantly lower than that of
tacrine. in the  xxxd1804xxx - and 4-aminoquinolinetacrine heterodimers series (7) and (8), tether lengths of 7 or
8 methylenes afford the highest ache potency (12.8-13.6
and 8.8-10.1 nm, respectively). thus within experimental
error, a tether length of 7 or 8 methylenes in all cases
provides the optimum ache affinity. this slight variation is
likely due to different optimum binding orientations of the
peripheral site ligands and the inability to exactly realize the
ideal spacing between the peripheral and catalytic sites with
an alkylene chain. all of these peripheral site ligands will be

protonated under assay conditions and thus can potentially
undergo cation-pi interaction with w279. ache ic50 values
of the optimum heterodimers decrease significantly as the
peripheral site ligand was permuted in the series ammonia >
dimethylamine >  xxxd1804xxx  > 4-aminoquinoline >
tacrine. calculated desolvation free energies of the optimum
dimers match the trend in ic50 values, suggesting the
importance of ligand hydrophobicity for effective cation-pi
interaction with the peripheral site (table 2).
to systematically investigate the effect of catalytic site
ligand perturbation on the ache inhibition potency of
dimeric ligands, three series of symmetrical homologous
bivalent inhibitors possessing a tacrine-like core were
prepared and evaluated [50]. aminoquinaldine dimers (9i,k)
and 4-aminoquinoline dimers (10i,k) have been evaluated
previously for k+ channel blocker activity [51].  xxxd1804xxx  dimers (11) have also been evaluated as antimicrobial agents (11i) [52] and as polyamine modulators of
nmda receptor function (11b-c) [49]. dimers (9f-i) and
(10e-i,k) were prepared as the bis-hydrochloride salts in
good to excellent yields by refluxing the corresponding
diamine with 4-chloroquinaldine or 4-chloroquinoline,
respectively.  xxxd1804xxx  dimers 11e-k were prepared
by a modification of the two step acylation-reduction method
previously developed for 11i [52]. as an additional control,
alkylated monomers of these heterocycles were also prepared
(scheme 6).
table 2.

in all cases significant tether length-dependent potency
and selectivity enhancements (up to 3000-fold) were seen
relative to the corresponding monomers, indicating simultaneous binding to the catalytic and peripheral sites of ache
(see table 3).
interestingly, whereas  xxxd1804xxx  itself exhibited
no ache inhibition at concentrations up to 0.5 mm, the
dodecamethylene-linked dimer (11k) shows significant
ache potency (ic50 = 152 ± 30 nm), giving it greater ache
inhibition potency and selectivity than tacrine. this result
demonstrates that dual-site binding can occur in systems
where the monomer has no discernable affinity to the receptor, but contains a key fragment of a known high-affinity
ligand. as will be described below, this insight prompted the
development of huperzine fragment dimers [53].
the observation that the dimerization potency versus free
monomer was greatest (>3000-fold) for the most hydrophilic
head group ( xxxd1804xxx ), and lowest for the most
hydrophobic head group (tacrine), suggested that the hydrophobic nature of the tether might be playing a role in the
potency enhancements. thus alkylated monomers 12 - 15
were prepared, in which the length of the alkyl chain
matches the optimum tether of the corresponding dimer. nn-heptyl tacrine (15) is only half as potent than tacrine at rat
ache, although the potency order is apparently reversed at
electophorus electricus ache (eeache) [54]. on the other
hand, n-n-dodecyl- xxxd1804xxx  (14) is >320-fold more

potent than  xxxd1804xxx  at rat ache. these data suggest
that the alkylene tether can play at least two complementary
roles in the dimers. for large hydrophobic monomers like
tacrine, the tether increases potency by reducing entropy loss
on binding both units of the dimer. for the smaller,
hydrophilic monomers 4-aminoquinaldine, 4-aminoquinoline
and  xxxd1804xxx , the tether increases potency both by
reducing entropy loss on binding, and by reducing the desolvation penalty of the monomer. thus the hydrophobicity of
the tether can be an important contributor to the potency of
dimeric ache inhibitors.
several other investigators have recently published work
on tacrine dimer analogs. savini [55] reinvestigated 1f using
fetal bovine serum (fbs) ache and equine (eq)  xxxg248xxx 
(92% and 88% homology with human ache and  xxxg248xxx ,
respectively), and found similar inhibition potencies at both
enzymes. this lack of selectivity stands in stark contrast to
results with rat ache and rat  xxxg248xxx , where  xxxg248xxx /ache
ic50 ratios ranged from 980 [40] to 99 [42]. although the
relevance of potent inhibition of eq  xxxg248xxx  to the develop-

ment of a human therapeutic is not known, this observation
prompted the development of new tacrine-based selective
inhibitors for fbs ache and eq  xxxg248xxx  (table 4).
savini et al. were the first to demonstrate that substitution of the central methylene unit of bis(7)-tacrine (1f) could
usefully perturb cholinesterase potencies and selectivities.
drugs 16 and 17 feature substitution of the central methylene
by nme and nc(o)me respectively; this change acts as
‘switch’ to either dramatically lower or raise fbs ache ic 50
values. because eq  xxxg248xxx  ic50 values are largely unchanged
by this variation, drug 16 offers both 60 pm inhibition of
fbs ache and excellent eq  xxxg248xxx /fbs ache selectivity;
17 in contrast has excellent selectivity for eq.  xxxg248xxx  [56].
even better potency for eq  xxxg248xxx  can be obtained by
replacing the basic, protonatable tacrine unit of 1f with a 9thio-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine unit. drug 18 exhibits subnanomolar potency for eq.  xxxg248xxx , a result that may lead to
the development of new potent and selective  xxxg248xxx  inhibitors [56]. finally, savini et al. explored the effect of 6,8dichloro-substitution on the tacrine nucleus. whereas mono-

proved less potent than tacrine dimer 1f and 19 itself [55].
hu [57] and coworkers also chose to focus on dimeric
inhibitors featuring modification of the tacrine nucleus, in
particular 6-substitution, changes in carbocyclic ring size,
and isosteric modification (table 5).

a range of tether lengths were explored with all of the
modified tacrine nuclei; in general the 7-methylene tether
was optimal for ache inhibition potency. heptylene-linked
bis-(6-chloro)-tacrine (20) proved 3000- and 3-fold more
potent in inhibiting rat ache than tacrine and the bis(7)tacrine (1f), respectively. this potency increase parallels that
known for 6-chlorotacrine relative to tacrine [58, 59].

reduced ache potency and selectivity. reduction (22) or
enlargement (23) of the size of the carbocyclic ring of the
dimers reduced both the selectivity and the potency of ache
inhibition relative to 1f.
4. design and synthesis of
inhibitors from (-)- xxxd2287xxx 

dimeric

(-)- xxxd2287xxx , isolated from the clubmoss huperzia
serrata, a chinese folk medicine (qian ceng ta), is a potent
and selective ache inhibitor that shows promise for the
palliative treatment of ad [9]. owing to its potent and
selective anti-ache activity and memory-enhancing effect
on a broad range of behavioral animal models, (-)-huperzine
a has attracted considerable attention. several total syntheses have been reported [60-62]. however, the lack of
patent protection has hindered development of this drug in
the west. in an effort to develop new chemical entities
derived from (-)- xxxd2287xxx , numerous chemical structural
modifications of this molecule have been undertaken [9, 6368]. however, ache inhibition potency proved to be
intolerant of even small structural changes, and at the start of
our work in this area, only two structural analogues of (-) xxxd2287xxx  matched or exceeded the potency of the natural
product [67].
since pang’s earlier computational studies indicated
affinity of (-)- xxxd2287xxx  for the peripheral site of tcache
[39],  xxxd2287xxx -derived dimers appeared to be a promising
target. however, to achieve this goal, carlier, pang, and han
chose to use a bicyclic fragment of  xxxd2287xxx  (hupyridone,
24), rather than the intact natural product (scheme 7).

scheme 7.  xxxd2287xxx  fragments (hupyridones, 24-26), synthetic
intermediate 27, and tacrine-hupyridone heterodimers 28 [69].

this decision was made principally from the perspective
of economy and synthetic ease; but as will become apparent
below, this decision proved essential to achieving potent
ache inhibition. although n-alkylated hupyridones such as
25 are known to be extremely weak ache inhibitors [65],
our previous investigations have disclosed that monomers
which have no discernable affinity for ache can still serve

as effective peripheral site ligands, when incorporated in a
bivalent drug [50].
tacrine-hupyridone heterodimers ((±)-28c-i,k) were
trivially prepared by forming the schiff bases of tacrineamino heterodimers (5c-i,k) and known 5-oxoquinolinone 27
[70], followed by reduction [69]. the assay results for rat
ache and  xxxg248xxx  inhibition showed that tacrine-hupyridone
heterodimers ((±)-28) are all more potent for ache inhibition than tacrine. the optimum drug (±)-28i has nanomolar
affinity for ache (ic50 = 8.8 nm), and is 13-fold more
potent than (-)- xxxd2287xxx . although (±)-28i does not
possess the excellent selectivity of (-)- xxxd2287xxx , it is
considerably more selective than tacrine. as expected, the nbutyl-hupyridone control (26) is an extremely weak inhibitor
(ic50 ≈ 500,000 nm). however, linking the parent monomer
(24) to tacrine via an alkylene tether results in significant
enhancement in ache inhibition potency and selectivity. we
therefore propose that (±)-28i derives its high potency and
selectivity from simultaneous binding to the peripheral and
catalytic sites of ache. in closing this section on tacrinehuperzine a fragment heterodimers it is necessary to cite the
excellent work of camps et al. on “conjuctive pharmacomodulation” of tacrine and  xxxd2287xxx  [71, 72]. instead of
constructing a bivalent derivative that would span the catalytic and peripheral sites, camps et al. fused the  xxxd2287xxx 
and tacrine structures together into a single drug unit. the
optimum drug,  xxxd1439xxx , was shown to possess 26 pm
affinity for human ache, an impressive accomplishment for
an inhibitor that binds only to the catalytic site [72].
our success with tacrine-huperzine fragment heterodimer
(±)-28i suggested that the huperzine fragment was an
effective peripheral site ligand, at least when incorporated in
a tacrine heterodimer. however a question emerged: could
homodimers of a huperzine fragment also exhibit potent and
selective ache inhibition? based on the x-ray crystal
structure of the torpedo ache•(-)- xxxd2287xxx  complex
[31], hupyridone 24 appears to possess much of the requisite
functionality for binding to the catalytic site region of ache.
in particular 24 retains the pyridone oxygen atom and nh
group of (-)- xxxd2287xxx , which form hydrogen bonds to
y130 and to  xxxg117xxx /e199 (through a water molecule), respectively, and the 5-amino group, which undergoes a cation-piinteraction with w84/f330. bis(n)-hupyridones (29) were
thus prepared as a mixture of the rac- and meso-diastereomers, using a method analogous to that used for 28 [53]
(scheme 8).
bis(n)-hupyridones (rac-/meso-29d-i,k) showed dramatic, tether length-dependent potency increases relative to nbutyl hupyridone monomer 26, with the highest potency
observed at a tether length of 12 methylene groups (rac/meso-29k, 159 nm) [53]. the preparation of the pure
enantiomers of 29 was then carried out by transformation of
27 to protected amine 30. resolution with (r)-(-)-mandelic
acid afforded (s)-(+)-30; this building block was then used to
prepare (s,s)-29i-m. the corresponding enantiomers were
prepared analogously from (r)-(-)-30 (obtained from
resolution with (s)-(+)-mandelic acid).
the enantiomerically pure dimers were then assayed
(table 6).

as can be seen in table 6, ache ic50 values evidence
significant tether length dependence in the (s,s)-series,
suggesting dual-site binding. furthermore, the 60-fold greater potency of (s,s)-(-)-29k relative to its enantiomer (r,r)(+)-29k suggests a multipoint interaction with the ache
active site. remarkably the optimum drugs (s,s)-(-)-29k,l
are nearly 10,000-fold more potent than the related monomer
(±)-26, and are twice as potent as the natural product (-) xxxd2287xxx  [53].
bis(n)-hupyridones (29) were designed to interact with
the ache active site in the same manner as (-)- xxxd2287xxx .
from that perspective the absolute configuration of the most
active dimers (s,s)-(-)-29k,l was unexpected, since (-) xxxd2287xxx  is (5r)-configured. docking studies of tcache
with the n-methyl analogues of (r)- and (s)-24 supported
the idea that the (s)-configuration was required at the active
site in order to direct the tether up the gorge to the peripheral
site [53]. recent x-ray crystallographic studies of (s,s)-(-)-

29i,k complexed to tcache confirm that these drugs bind to
the active and peripheral sites of ache [73]. furthermore,
the catalytic site hupyridone units of (s,s)-(-)-29i,k make all
the same close contacts with catalytic site residues as does
(-)- xxxd2287xxx , vindicating the design principle that lead to
the dimers [73]. enzyme inhibition studies performed with
tcache confirmed the enhanced potency of the dimers
relative to (-)- xxxd2287xxx , but provided some unexpected
results as well. first, whereas the optimum tether length in
rat is 12 methylenes, for torpedo californica, the optimum
tether length is 10 methylenes [73]. secondly, whereas in rat
the optimum dimer is only twice as potent as (-)-huperzine
a, in torpedo californica the corresponding potency
enhancement is 175-fold.
in 2002 bai et al. reported the synthesis of alkylenelinked dimers of the intact (-)- xxxd2287xxx  natural product,
using a reductive alkylation procedure [74] (scheme 9).

et al. [74]

the most potent dimer in the series was (-)-31f, with a
seven methylene tether; however this drug was 5-fold less
potent than (-)- xxxd2287xxx . the authors gave no explanation
for this suprising result, which illustrates that there is no
simple correlation between the inhibition potencies of
monomers and the corresponding dimers [38]. furthermore
the juxtaposition of these two approaches to huperzine abased dimers suggests that when developing dimeric drugs
based on structurally complex natural products, it may be
useful to incorporate fragments, rather than the intact natural
product.

the only non-quaternary derivative to show greater
inhibitory potency than galanthamine was 32. oxidation to
the iminium derivative (33) introduces a permanent charge
and improves inhibition potency considerably [75].
similarly, monoquaternary derivative 34 is 4-fold more
potent than galanthamine. increased inhibition potency can
also be achieved by linking a phthalimide moiety through the
phenolic oxygen (35). based on the x-ray crystal structure of
the tcache•galanthamine complex, sussman et al. noted
that is likely that inhibitors 32-34 can span the catalytic and
peripheral sites of ache without disturbing the preferred
binding orientation of the galanthamine unit [32].
guillou et al. also prepared galanthamine homodimers
and galanthamine/galanthaminium heterodimers [78] (scheme
11).
the potency of the optimum galanthamine homodimer 36

5. design and synthesis of galanthamine
and polyamine-based dimeric inhibitors
galanthamine is a centrally acting competitive and
reversible ache inhibitor that has been shown to produce
significant improvement of cognitive performances in ad
patients [75]. in addition to being less toxic than tacrine and
physostigmine, galanthamine also allosterically regulates the
 xxxg456xxx  [76]. nicotinic receptor
modulation represents a promising new direction in
alzheimer’s research [77]. guillou and coworkers [75]
reported the synthesis and ache inhibition potency of
galanthamine heterodimers. these drugs feature pendant
phthalimide or trimethylammonium groups that are linked to
the galanthamine nitrogen or phenolic oxygen. assays using
eeache indicated tether length-dependent potency of the
heterodimers. the optimum dimers (32-35) are depicted in
scheme 10.

nium heterodimer matched that of galanthaminium/
phthalimide heterodimer 33, being 30-fold more potent than
galanthamine. however, whether 37 or the other cationic
galanthamine derivatives 33-35 could penetrate the bloodbrain barrier has yet to be established; therefore their promise
as centrally-available, memory enhancing therapeutics for
alzheimer’s disease is still unclear.
another promising target to improve cholinergic neurotransmission are the muscarinic m2 autoreceptors, since
inhibition of these autoreceptors would increase ach release
into the synapse. melchiorre and coworkers chose the
polyamine scaffold in an attempt to prepare drugs that would
inhibit both ache and muscarinic m2 autoreceptors [79].
submicromolar ache inhibition was obtained with
caproctamine (38) (scheme 12).
caproctamine (38) also was a micromolar or submicromolar antagonist at m1, m2, and m3 receptors [79]. the
twenty-two atom spacing between the two basic tertiary
amines is much longer than any bivalent inhibitor described
thus far, raising the question of how it binds to ache.
however, melchiorre et al. reported that docking studies
indicate the chain can fold in such a way as to provide a 1016 å distance between the o-methoxybenzylamine groups.
subsequent optimization led to the n-ethyl analog 39, which
is a 10-nanomolar ache inhibitor that showed submicromolar potency for reversing a neuromuscular block and
micromolar potency for antagonism of the m2 autoreceptor
[80].
6. new approaches in the design and
synthesis of dimeric ache inhibitors
the observation that ache has two binding sites for
substrate and inhibitors prompted two recent investigations
into the synthesis and evaluation of dimeric inhibitors. while
these inhibitors formed are quaternary and not likely to
penetrate the blood-brain barrier, the techniques involved,
and affinities achieved merit discussion. lehn et al. used
parallel synthesis to prepare a potent bis-quaternary inhibitor
[81]. four hydrazides were combined pairwise with each of
nine aldehydes (4 mono-, 5 dialdehydes) to prepare the
corresponding bis-acylhydrazones, and the purified products
were screened at torpedo marmorata ache (scheme 13).
the most potent pairwise combination produced 40 (ic 50
value of 2.30 ± 0.09 nm) [81], a bis-pyridinium reminiscent
of dap (scheme 2). since acylhydrazone formation is
reversible under the reaction conditions (ph 4.2), and
irreversible under the assay conditions (ph 7.2), lehn et al.
then explored the possibility of identifying the potent
combination by dynamic combinatorial chemistry and

dynamic deconvolution-screening. this process consists of
comparing the inhibitory potency of a mixture containing all
13 components, with that of 13 sublibraries that each lack
one of the components. in this way lehn et al. were able to
confirm that mixtures lacking the optimum building blocks
were significantly less potent than the mixture of all 13
building blocks [81]. with a large number of building blocks
this dynamic deconvolution-screening process could be more
economical than the traditional method of screening pairwise
combinations.

as this review has illustrated, traditional drug discovery
depends upon the iterative cycle of design, synthesis, and
screening. the pharmacology of one iteration of drugs then
directs (via human intervention) design of the next iteration.
an interesting alternative to traditional approach is to allow
an enzyme to synthesize its own inhibitor, in a non-iterative
fashion, without any human intervention. such an approach
would depend upon the simultaneous binding of two ligands,
each decorated with complementary reactive groups, to
adjacent sites on the protein. the co-localization of these
ligands is then likely to accelerate the reaction that connects
them, and the product formed should have excellent affinity
for the enzyme. this approach was successfully employed in
a collaborative effort of sharpless, finn, taylor, and carlier
[82]. in brief, a collection of  xxxd3027xxx -based ligands and
tacrine-based ligands were prepared, each designed to bind
to the ache peripheral and catalytic/peripheral anionic sites,
respectively (scheme 14).
these ligands were decorated with either azide or
terminal acetylene moieties, in order to make use of the

7. future directions
this review has demonstrated that significant enhancements in drug potency and selectivity can be achieved
through the dimer approach, although this strategy is not
uniformly successful. some monomers, such as tacrine [40,
42], 6-chlorotacrine [57], and hupyridone [53] achieve
dramatic increases in potency upon dimerization. however
others, such as 6,8-dichlorotacrine [55], huperzine [74], and
galanthamine [78], do not. these disparate results were
foreseen years ago by jencks [38], who noted that the very
act of adding a tether to a molecule can disrupt its favored
binding orientation. will a therapeutically useful drug
emerge from these studies? bis(7)-tacrine has already shown
effectiveness in in vivo rat ache inhibition [43], memory
[44, 45], and neuroprotection [85, 86] models. dimeric
ache inhibitors might also have the advantage of blocking
beta-amyloid aggregation. since inestrosa’s initial report that
ache accelerates beta-amyloid fibril formation [11], a number
of other studies have confirmed that blockage of the ache
peripheral site inhibits beta-amyloid aggregation [87]. in
particular, andrisano et al. demonstrated that 100 µm  xxxd3027xxx  inhibited human ache-induced beta-amyloid aggregation
by 82% [88]. finally, valenti et al. demonstrated that e2020
and 42 have 20 nm potency to inhibit human ache, and at
100 µm they inhibit beta-amyloid aggregation by 22 and 35%
respectively [89] (scheme 16).

was not designed using the dimer approach, x-ray crystallography revealed that it does span the gorge between the
catalytic and peripheral anionic sites [14]. based on the
structural similarity of 42 and e2020, the authors propose a
similar binding mode for 42. if the potency for inhibiting betaamyloid aggregation could be significantly increased, dualsite binding ache inhibitors would not only improve
cognition in early-stage alzheimer’s disease, but might have
promise for reversing the progression of disease.
