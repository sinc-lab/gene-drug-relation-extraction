mongin, alexander a., zhaohui cai, and harold k.
kimelberg. volume-dependent taurine release from cultured astrocytes requires permissive [ca2⫹]i and calmodulin.
am. j. physiol. 277 (cell physiol. 46): c823–c832, 1999.—
cell swelling results in regulatory activation of multiple
conductive anion pathways permeable toward a broad spectrum of intracellular organic osmolytes. here, we explore the
involvement of extracellular and intracellular ca2⫹ in volumedependent [3h]taurine efflux from primary cultured astrocytes and compare the ca2⫹ sensitivity of this efflux in slow
(high k⫹ medium induced) and fast (hyposmotic medium
induced) cell swelling. neither ca2⫹-free medium nor
ca2⫹-channel blockers prevented the volume-dependent
[3h]taurine release. in contrast, loading cells with the membrane-permeable ca2⫹ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n8,n8-tetraacetic acid (bapta)-am suppressed
[3h]taurine efflux by 65–70% and 25–30% under high-k⫹ and
hyposmotic conditions, respectively. fura 2 measurements
confirmed that bapta-am, but not ca2⫹-free media, significantly reduced resting intracellular ca2⫹ concentration
([ca2⫹]i ). the calmodulin antagonists  xxxd3431xxx  and
fluphenazine reversibly and irreversibly, respectively, inhibited the high-k⫹-induced [3h]taurine release, consistent with
their known actions on calmodulin. in hyposmotic conditions,
the effects were less pronounced. these data suggest that
volume-dependent taurine release requires minimal basal
[ca2⫹]i and involves calmodulin-dependent step(s). quantitative differences in ca2⫹/calmodulin sensitivity of high-k⫹induced and hyposmotic medium-induced taurine efflux are
due to both the effects of the inhibitors on high-k⫹-induced
cell swelling and their effects on transport systems and/or
signaling mechanisms determining taurine efflux.

as in most cell types, cultured astrocytes exposed to
hyposmotic medium undergo swelling and then regulate their volume back toward normal due to activation
of k⫹ and cl⫺ efflux through volume-sensitive ion
channels (3, 39). some free amino acids, especially
taurine, may also participate in cell volume regulation
in astrocytes (19, 38, 40), as in other cell types (12).
taurine-deficient astrocytes have higher volumes than
control cells and show incomplete volume restoration in
hyposmotic medium (30). in neural cells in vivo and in
vitro, taurine efflux is more sensitive to volume changes
compared with other organic anions and k⫹ (37, 38, 57).

the costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the
payment of page charges. the article must therefore be hereby
marked ‘‘advertisement’’ in accordance with 18 u.s.c. section 1734
solely to indicate this fact.

these findings support the view that taurine may play
a role as a major cell osmoregulatory molecule in the
brain.
taurine and other amino acids may have a special
importance in volume regulation when cell swelling is
promoted by increases in extracellular k⫹, since net
efflux of k⫹ and cl⫺ is likely to be suppressed under this
condition. the high-k⫹-induced release of taurine and
other amino acids from cultured astrocytes is mediated
primarily by volume-sensitive anion channels (20, 41,
45). the molecular nature of these channels is currently being investigated (for review, see refs. 35 and
51). there is very limited work on the intracellular
mechanisms linking the change in cell volume with the
activation of transport pathways. in the case of hyposmotic swelling, ca2⫹ has been considered as a candidate for a volume signaling molecule in astrocytes (2,
32), as in many other cell types (26). the ca2⫹ dependence of high-k⫹-induced taurine release in astrocytes
is controversial. both dependence (43) and independence (24, 41) have been reported. in comparisons of
hyposmotic and high-k⫹-induced astrocytic swelling
and volume regulation, it should be noted that, depending on magnitude and rate of volume changes, different
regulatory transport pathways and signaling mechanisms may be expected (50). an additional important
point is that treatments that inhibit high-k⫹-induced
amino acid release may affect entry of kcl to cause cell
swelling in addition to, or instead of, inhibition of
volume-dependent efflux, which will also cause inhibition of amino acid release. for hyposmotic-induced
swelling, inhibition of the initial volume changes occurring from water influx is deemed much less likely. to
help resolve some of these problems, we studied in the
present work how treatments that differentially affect
intracellular ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]i ) alter both
high-k⫹ medium- and hyposmotic medium-induced cell
volume alterations and associated [3h]taurine release
in cultured astrocytes.

role of [ca2⫹]i in volume-dependent taurine release

cell cultures. primary astrocyte cultures were prepared
from the cerebral cortex of newborn sprague-dawley rats, as
described by frangakis and kimelberg (8). the dissociated
cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated 18 ⫻ 18-mm coverslips (bellco biotechnology, vineland, nj), and cultures were
used after 3–4 wk when the cells reached confluence. immunocytochemistry showed that ⬎95% of the cells stained
positively for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acid protein. cell viability was routinely monitored by trypan blue
exclusion and was always ⬎95%.
isotope efflux measurements. astrocytes grown on coverslips were incubated in an incubator in 5% co2-95% air at
37°c overnight in 2.5 ml of mem containing 10% heatinactivated horse serum plus 8 µci/ml [3h]taurine (final
concentration of 270 nm). in some experiments, 16 µci/ml
na251cro4 (final concentration of 230–270 nm) was also
added to the incubation medium. the appearance of 51cr in
the perfusate during release experiments can be used to
monitor whether an increase in [3h]taurine release is due to
cell detachment or lysis (17).
before the start of efflux measurements, which were done
at 35°c, the cells were preincubated for 10 min in hepesbuffered solution at 35°c to remove extracellular isotope and
serum-containing medium and adapt the cells to experimental conditions. the basal medium for efflux measurements
consisted of (in mm) 122 nacl, 3.3 kcl, 0.4  xxxd2534xxx , 1.3 cacl2,
1.2 kh2po4, 10 d-glucose, and 25 hepes. naoh (10 n) was
used to adjust the ph to 7.4. after the washing procedure, the
coverslips were inserted into a lucite perfusion chamber with
a depression precisely cut in the bottom to accommodate the
18 ⫻ 18 ⫻ 0.19-mm (width ⫻ height ⫻ thickness) glass
coverslip. the chamber has a teflon screw top and when
screwed down leaves a space above the cells of around 100 µm
in height. the cells were perfused at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min
in an incubator set at 34.5–35°c with the basal hepesbuffered medium (for composition, see above) or with high-k⫹
medium in which nacl was replaced with an equimolar
amount of kcl to give a final extracellular k⫹ concentration
([k⫹]o ) of 100 mm. the volume of the chamber above the
coverslip is ⬃32 µl and allows a complete change of the
perfusion buffer in ⬍2 min, as directly determined by removal
of a trypan blue-containing solution. the osmolarities of all
buffers were measured by a freezing point osmometer (advanced instruments, needham heights, ma) and were in the
range of 285–290 mosm. fractions (1 min) were collected. at
the end of experiment, the cells were removed from the
coverslips with a solution containing 1% sds plus 4 mm
edta. when 51cr was present, the samples were first counted
in a clini-c lkb 1272 counter (pharmacia, gaitherburg,
md). ecoscint (5 ml, national diagnostics, atlanta, ga) was
then added, and each fraction was counted for 3h in a
packard tri-carb 1900tr liquid scintillation analyzer (packard instrument, meriden, ct) set at 2.0–18.6 kev to exclude
51cr radioactivity. percent fractional release for each time
point was calculated by dividing radioactivity released in
each 1-min interval by the radioactivity left in the cells (the
sum of all the radioactive counts in the remaining fractions
up to the beginning of the fraction being measured, plus the
radioactivity left in the cell digest) and multiplying by 100.
for measurement of hyposmotic-induced [3h]taurine release, an identical experimental design was used. in hyposmotic medium, the concentration of nacl was reduced by 50
mm (final osmolarity was 190 mosm).
cell volume measurements. astrocytic cell volume was
measured at 35°c using an electric impedance method (33),
with minor modifications. the glass coverslips (no. 1.5; 0.19 ⫾
0.01 mm thickness) plus cells were perfused at a constant
rate of ⬃0.4–0.5 ml/min in the same lucite chamber as used

for the efflux experiments. silver wire electrodes were inserted on both sides of the channel. these were soldered to an
insulated copper wire and connected in series through a 1 m⍀
resistor to a lock-in amplifier (model sr510; stanford research systems, sunnyvale, ca) that supplied a 500-hz, 5-v
signal to the system. at this frequency, current does not pass
through the cells. as the volume of the monolayer increases,
the volume of the solution above the cells available for current
flow decreases proportionally, resulting in an increase in the
measured resistance. because current is constant due to a
1-m⍀ series resistor, changes in voltage are directly proportional to changes in resistance of the solution above the
monolayer and therefore directly related to the volume of
solution above the cells. because the resistivities of basal and
high-k⫹ media were different, the resistivity of all experimental solutions was first measured in the chamber containing a
blank coverslip, and all results were normalized in terms of
medium resistivity. when different drugs were added to
solutions, any effect on resistance was also checked but
usually no effect was observed. to measure hyposmotic
medium-induced volume regulation, 50 mm nacl in isotonic
medium was replaced with 100 mm  xxxd2540xxx  to assure that
na⫹ concentration and medium resistivity would not differ
between isotonic and hypotonic media (33).
calibrations and calculations, which were done in previous
studies (33), showed that a 1% change in resistance of the
volume measurement chamber approximately correspond to
a 20–25% change in total volume of the cell monolayer.
because we did not perform calibrations for the experiments
presented in this study, all data are given as a normalized
resistance signal.
[ca2⫹]i microspectrofluorometry. free [ca2⫹]i measurements were performed with a monochromator-based deltascan spectrofluorometric system (model rf d-4010; pti, south
brunswick, nj) with dual excitation at 350- and 380-nm
wavelengths and a bandpass of 2 nm. fluorescent emission
was measured at 510 nm using a nikon diaphot microscope
to which a photomultiplier was attached. primary cultures on
coverslips were loaded with 4 µm fura 2-am in basal hepesbuffered medium for 30 min at 37°c. the coverslips were
rinsed several times with the same solution without fura
2-am and allowed to equilibrate at 37°c. the coverslip with
loaded cells was then placed in a pdmi-2 open perfusion
chamber with a tc-202 bipolar temperature controller (medical systems, greenville, ny) and maintained at 37°c.
each [ca2⫹]i determination was done on a single cell. to
change medium in the chamber, basal, high-k⫹, or drugcontaining hepes-buffered medium was completely changed
three times using a pasteur pipette at the beginning of each
20-min experimental period and then carefully replaced with
the same medium at 5-min intervals to mimic perfusion
conditions.
ca2⫹ calibration was performed for fura 2 in selected cells
by equilibrating [ca2⫹]i at varying extracellular ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]i ) values in the presence of 5 µm  xxxd2379xxx .
[ca2⫹]i was calculated from the formula of grynkiewicz et
al. (9)
[ca2⫹]i ⫽ kd␤(r ⫺ rmin) / (rmax ⫺ r)
rmax was obtained in a solution containing 4 mm cacl2 and
 xxxd2379xxx . rmin was obtained in a solution without ca2⫹ and
containing 5 mm egta, also with 5 µm  xxxd2379xxx ; ␤ was the
ratio of fluorescence values excited at 380 nm without and
with ca2⫹. the dissociation constant (kd ) was assumed to be
the same as in vitro, under likely similar conditions, namely
224 nm (9).

influence of high-k⫹ medium on cell volume, [3h]taurine release, and [ca2⫹]i in primary astrocytic cultures.
exposure of primary astrocytes to 100 mm kcl medium induced a progressively increasing cell swelling
(fig. 1a). when high-k⫹ medium was replaced with
basal medium, cell volume was restored to near initial

levels within 5–7 min (fig. 1a). the high-k⫹-induced
cell swelling was accompanied by stimulation of [3h]taurine release (fig. 1b). successive exposures to high k⫹
medium led to an increase of labeled amino acid
release, but each peak was somewhat smaller than the
previous one. this made it problematic to quantitatively compare the actions of different drugs on taurine
efflux in one experiment. therefore, we measured both
the average maximal fractional release during a 20min exposure to high [k⫹]o, as observed at minute 20,
and the sum of fractional releases (peak area) over a
20-min exposure to high [k⫹]o of the first peak of

entire 20-min exposure was 29.34 ⫾ 0.53% (n ⫽ 8,

were more variable with regard to amplitude and area.
unlike [3h]taurine, 51cr efflux, used for measuring cell
loss or lysis (17), was very low (0.03–0.08%/min) and
rarely varied during the whole experimental period in
basal and high-k⫹ conditions (fig. 1b).
we also monitored the influence of high k⫹ medium
on [ca2⫹]i under the same conditions and within the
time intervals used for isotope efflux studies. resting
[ca2⫹]i was calculated to be ⬃110–130 nm. the single
cell responses to high [k⫹]o were very variable. two of
nine cells showed very sharp increases in [ca2⫹]i, up to
600–700 nm with fast normalization within 1–2 min to
basal levels; this was followed by a small progressive
[ca2⫹]i elevation (fig. 1c). in three other cells, high k⫹
induced a smaller [ca2⫹]i rise (50–150 nm) with slower
normalization (within 3–5 min) and no subsequent
secondary increase during the 20-min exposure to high
k⫹. this type of [ca2⫹]i signal was similar to the second
exposure to high k⫹ shown in fig 1f. finally, four cells
demonstrated no response to high k⫹ or even a decrease of [ca2⫹]i (data not shown). it should be stressed
that astrocytes not responding to high k⫹ showed a
typical [ca2⫹]i peak when exposed to 20 µm atp, as
normally seen in cultured astrocytes (18).
effects of ca2⫹-free medium and ca2⫹ channel blockers on high-k⫹-induced cell volume changes, [3h]taurine release, and [ca2⫹]i. when we exposed cells to
high-k⫹, ca2⫹-free medium containing 50 µm egta,
k⫹-evoked cell swelling and [3h]taurine release were
shown to be not statistically different from control,
high-k⫹ conditions (summarized in table 1); this was
consistent with previous observations (24, 41). however, because a complete change of medium in our

superfusion chamber could be achieved only within 2
min, it left a possibility for activation of ca2⫹-dependent intracellular events within this time frame. therefore, we preincubated cells for 15 min in ca2⫹-free
conditions before exposing them to elevated [k⫹]o.
superfusion of cells with ca2⫹-free medium containing
50 µm egta led to modest cell swelling under basal
(low [k⫹]o ) conditions (fig. 1d, first response). the
subsequent high-k⫹-induced cell swelling in extracellular ca2⫹-free medium was somewhat slower but not
significantly different compared with control high-k⫹induced cell swelling (fig. 1d).
if the cells were exposed to ca2⫹-free medium 15 min
before and during the first exposure to high [k⫹]o, the
stimulated specific [3h]taurine release, determined as
the difference between total [3h]taurine efflux and 51cr
releases both being expressed in the same way as
fractional isotope release (see materials and methods ),
was inhibited by 20% compared with control high-[k⫹]oinduced responses (table 1). also, the release was
inhibited compared with the second exposure to high
[k⫹]o in the same cell preparation (fig. 1e). as shown
in fig. 1e, exposure to ca2⫹-free medium increased cell
loss (or lysis) under basal conditions and in high-[k⫹]o
medium, as evaluated by 51cr efflux. if ca2⫹-free media
were applied after the first or second exposure to high
[k⫹]o, the increases in cell loss/lysis were much more
pronounced (data not shown), probably mirroring lower
stability of cell membranes or altered cell adhesion
properties.
the replacement of basal medium with ca2⫹-free
buffer containing 50 µm egta (assuming that in
nominally ca2⫹-free medium ca2⫹ concentration is
ⱕ1–2 µm, the calculated free [ca2⫹]o is ⱕ15 nm)
decreased [ca2⫹]i to a new equilibrium level, which was
10–25 nm less compared with that in basal ca2⫹containing conditions (fig. 1f). there was no further
decrease in [ca2⫹]i during a 20-min exposure to ca2⫹free egta-containing medium in either basal or high[k⫹]o conditions. in two of six measured cells, [ca2⫹]o

role of [ca2⫹]i in volume-dependent taurine release

deprivation induced an increase of [ca2⫹]i within the
first several seconds (fig. 1f). this first response may
be attributed to ca2⫹ release from intracellular stores
due to extracellular ca2⫹ signal or volume changes (61).
after cells were returned to ca2⫹-containing medium,
[ca2⫹]i elevated to the starting level and the cells were
subsequently able to respond to high k⫹ (fig. 1f).
although we did not find long-lasting alterations of
[ca2⫹]i after exposure to high-k⫹ medium in most of the
measured cells (see above), we could not exclude that
ca2⫹ entry into astrocytes during depolarization with
high [k⫹]o (22, 23) contributed to high-[k⫹]o-induced
[3h]taurine release in a subpopulation of the cells and
that we are observing only the average effects. the
ca2⫹-free medium did not seem to be a very good
control because of nonspecific alterations in membrane
permeability and cell volume increases. therefore, we
checked the effects of several ca2⫹ channel blockers on
high-[k⫹]o-induced [3h]taurine release. concentrations
of 500 µm co2⫹, 100 µm cd2⫹, and 50 µm verapamil
have been found to completely inhibit voltage-dependent as well as volume-dependent ca2⫹ channels in
madin-darby canine kidney cells (26) and presynaptic
nerve terminals (27). in our experiments, 50 µm verapamil and 500 µm co2⫹ produced no significant inhibition of high-[k⫹]o-induced [3h]taurine release (table 1).
in contrast, 100 µm cd2⫹ strongly inhibited the taurine
efflux evoked by elevated [k⫹]o (table 1).
effect of intracellular ca2⫹ chelators on astrocytic cell
volume, [3h]taurine release, and [ca2⫹]i. to further
evaluate a possible involvement of [ca2⫹]i in high-[k⫹]oinduced amino acid release, we loaded astrocytes with
the acetoxymethyl ester of the ca2⫹ chelator bapta,
which is known to permeate cells in vitro (54) and to
decrease depolarization- and ligand-induced [ca2⫹]i
elevation by complexing with ca2⫹ (55). to avoid any of
the nonspecific alterations observed in ca2⫹-free medium, all bapta experiments were done in the presence of 1 mm cacl2. as shown in fig. 1i, loading with
10 µm bapta-am, even in ca2⫹-containing medium,
led to a significant decrease in [ca2⫹]i, down to levels of
40–50 nm. after washout of external bapta-am,
[ca2⫹]i only slightly increased. in two of three baptaloaded cells, we observed slight increases in [ca2⫹]i
following 100 mm [k⫹]o challenge; the most pronounced
response is presented in fig. 1i.
volume measurements showed that bapta-am pretreatment failed to affect high-[k⫹]o-induced astrocytic
swelling (fig. 1g). however, under basal conditions,
loading with bapta-am induced a fast and drastic
volume increase followed by volume regulation with a
time course similar to that previously observed in
hyposmotic medium (33, 39, 40).
the 30-min superfusion with 10 µm bapta-am
before application of high-[k⫹]o medium inhibited k⫹evoked [3h]taurine release by 60–70% (fig. 1h, table
1). loading with 3 µm bapta-am (see fig. 3b) or with
4 µm fura 2-am (fig. 2, table 1) produced no significant
inhibition of the high-[k⫹]o-induced [3h]taurine release. under basal conditions, an initial transient
[3h]taurine release was observed in some 10 µm

comparison of the sensitivity of high-[k⫹]o- and hyposmotic medium-induced [3h]taurine release to changes
in [ca2⫹]i. volume-dependent taurine release under
hyposmotic conditions was less sensitive to chelation of
intracellular ca2⫹ compared with the release induced
by elevated [k⫹]o. as seen in fig. 3, a and b, a 30-min
preexposure to 3 µm bapta-am was ineffective in
preventing hyposmotic medium-induced [3h]taurine
release; 10 µm bapta-am produced a moderate 25–
30% inhibition of the release vs. 75% inhibition of the
release under hyposmotic and high-[k⫹]o conditions,
respectively.
cell volume measurements performed under similar
conditions showed decreased hyposmotic swelling of
the bapta-treated cells, whereas the rate of regulatory volume decrease (rvd) was not significantly
changed (fig. 3c, exposure to hyposmotic medium).
once again, under basal conditions, exposure of cells to
10 µm bapta-am led to drastic transient increases in
cell volume followed by an isosmotic volume restoration

influence of calmodulin antagonists on high-[k⫹]oand hyposmotic medium-induced [3h]taurine release.
because volume regulation in hyposmotic medium and
the associated activation of k⫹ and anion fluxes are
calmodulin-dependent processes in many cells (for review, see ref. 26), we checked the effect of calmodulin
inhibitors on [3h]taurine efflux under conditions of
raised external k⫹. a reversible calmodulin inhibitor
 xxxd3431xxx  (25) reversibly reduced high-[k⫹]oinduced [3h]taurine release (fig. 4a and table 1). the
inhibition was concentration dependent, with an ic50 of
⬃10 µm (fig. 4b). long-term treatment, i.e., more than
30 min, with 25 µm  xxxd3431xxx  led to a progressive
increase of cell loss evaluated as 51cr release and
[3h]taurine efflux, which was presumably due to cytotoxic effects of this drug (data not shown). at concentrations higher than 25 µm, increases of both basal and
high-k⫹-induced amino acid release (fig. 4b) and cell

role of [ca2⫹]i in volume-dependent taurine release

under high-[k⫹]o conditions, the effect of calmodulin
antagonists on taurine release may be due to specific
inhibition of calmodulin-dependent volume signal transduction, direct interaction of the drugs with a volumedependent anion channel, or inhibition of kcl-induced
cell swelling. to help distinguish these possibilities, we
studied the influence of  xxxd3431xxx  on [3h]taurine
release under hyposmotic conditions. in this case,
anticalmodulin agents appeared not to affect cell swelling due to water influx following the imposed osmotic
gradient (2) but did block swelling-induced k⫹ release
(3, 58) and cell volume regulation (2, 58). the maximal
fractional efflux rate of hyposmotic medium-induced
[3h]taurine release varied between different culture
preparations. therefore, we compared the influence of
 xxxd3431xxx  on control values of efflux measured in
the same cell preparation on the same day. astrocytes
were pretreated with different concentrations of  xxxd3431xxx  for 15–20 min and then subjected to an
osmotic gradient of 100 mosm. both maximal fractional
release and area of peak were compared with control
values.  xxxd3431xxx  was a less effective blocker of
volume-dependent amino acid release in hyposmotic
medium compared with high-[k⫹]o conditions (fig. 4, d
and e). also, in contrast to the identical effects of
 xxxd3431xxx  on maximal rate and area of high-[k⫹]oinduced taurine release, we found that the area of the
hyposmotic release is less sensitive to  xxxd3431xxx 
pretreatment than the maximal fractional release: 15%
vs. 40% inhibition for area and fractional release,
respectively (fig. 4e). this discrepancy may be due to
confounding effects of calmodulin antagonists on rvd
(see discussion ).
to evaluate the possibility of whether the  xxxd3431xxx  effects were due to decreased cell swelling, we
studied its influence on high-[k⫹]o-induced cell volume
increase.  xxxd3431xxx  at 25 µm inhibited k⫹-evoked
astrocytic swelling (fig. 4f). unlike bapta-am, it did
not affect cell volume under basal isosmotic conditions.

loss measured with 51cr (data not shown) were observed even after short-term exposures (ⱕ20 min) to
 xxxd3431xxx . the irreversible calmodulin inhibitor
fluphenazine (1) produced potent (over 80%) inhibition
of swelling-induced [3h]taurine efflux at a concentration of 25 µm (fig. 4c, table 1). as expected, its effect
was completely irreversible (fig. 4c).

it is well established that brain tissue swells in
isosmotic high k⫹ medium (5, 6), which may be used as
a model for cytotoxic (cellular) edema (16). in pathophysiological conditions, such as ischemia, anoxia, or
head injury, external k⫹ can rise to 80 mm (11, 48). the
main cell type contributing to brain cellular edema
seems to be astroglial cells, which in vitro accumulate
k⫹ both by donnan uptake of kcl and through a
diuretic-sensitive carrier mechanism (16, 59, 60). in
brain tissue as well as in cell cultures, k⫹-evoked
astrocytic swelling is slow and is not followed by cell
volume regulation, presumably due to the inability of
the cells to lose kcl in the face of high extracellular k⫹
(33, 44). several studies have shown mobilization of
taurine under conditions that likely increase cell volume in brain (47, 57). swelling-induced release of
taurine in pathophysiological conditions in vivo may be
beneficial due to partial compensation for cell volume
increases or diminution of the level of neuronal excitability, since taurine is an inhibitory neuromodulator (14).

in the supraoptic nucleus, volume-dependent taurine
efflux from glial cells was found to inhibit neuronal
activity and was suggested to contribute to a neuroendocrine loop of body fluid homeostasis through the
modulation of vasopressin release (7, 13).
external ca2⫹ deprivation does not prevent high-k⫹induced taurine efflux but does affect glial cell volume
and taurine release under basal conditions. in general,
our findings confirm previous observations that high-k⫹induced release of [3h]taurine (24, 41) and d-[3h]aspartate (45) is independent of extracellular ca2⫹. we have
not found any significant effect of ca2⫹-free medium on
k⫹-induced [3h]taurine release when extracellular ca2⫹
was omitted during exposure to high [k⫹]o and observed only 15–20% inhibition of response when ca2⫹
was omitted 15 min before and during [k⫹]o elevation.
the latter effect may be due to small inhibition of cell
swelling, which was below the limit of statistical significance (see fig. 1d). however, as seen from our data,
complications of experiments in which ca2⫹-free medium is used include nonspecific alterations of plasma
membrane permeability, cell lysis, or cell detachment
as well as [ca2⫹]o-dependent cell volume changes. such

possibilities are not usually checked. we observed loss
of radioactivity from astrocytes preloaded with 51cr in
egta-containing ca2⫹-free medium as well as in nominally ca2⫹-free medium. these effects increased with
time of superfusion, and, after 30–40 min, the nonspecific [ca2⫹]o-dependent [3h]taurine release exceeded
values of the specific release by severalfold (not shown).
interestingly, exposure to high-[k⫹]o medium decreased 51cr efflux evoked by ca2⫹ deprivation, possibly
by making the membranes more stable by diminishing
the transmembrane electric potential, as seen in phospholipid bilayers (52). the specific [3h]taurine release
(corrected for cell loss/lysis) was still significantly stimulated in basal ca2⫹-free conditions. measurements of
cell volume revealed that deprivation of extracellular
ca2⫹ induced fast and relatively long-lasting cell swelling, which also contributed to the [ca2⫹]o-dependent
taurine release. cell swelling under ca2⫹-free conditions has previously been shown in a suspension of
cultured astrocytes by olson et al. (36) using a coulter
counter for cell volume monitoring. nonspecific alterations of membrane permeability, cell loss/lysis, and/or
volume changes induced by ca2⫹-free medium may also

role of [ca2⫹]i in volume-dependent taurine release

explain some data in previous studies. a pronounced
increase of basal taurine release in ca2⫹-free egtacontaining medium has been shown in brain slices (34),
synaptosomes (46), and cultured astrocytes (10, 43).
the ca2⫹ channel blockers verapamil (50 µm) and
co2⫹ (500 µm), known to suppress voltage- and volumedependent ca2⫹ channels (26, 27), did not significantly
affect high-[k⫹]o-evoked [3h]taurine release, supporting its independence of [ca2⫹]o. inhibition by 100 µm
cd2⫹ may be due to direct inhibition of a swellingactivated anion channel, since blockade of astrocytic
anion channels by millimolar concentrations of cd2⫹
and zn2⫹ has been demonstrated using the excised
patch-clamp technique (15). also, in human astrocytoma cells, the voltage-dependent anion currents were
suppressed approximately twofold by concentrations of
cd2⫹ and zn2⫹ as low as 25 and 100 µm, respectively
(56).
evidence for the requirement of a minimal basal
[ca2⫹]i for k⫹-evoked stimulation of taurine efflux. only
⬃50% of cultured cells in our preparations showed
immediate k⫹-evoked elevations of [ca2⫹]i. the absence of a depolarization-induced [ca2⫹]i signal in
approximately half of the cells may be because not all
the astrocytes in our cultures express a sufficient
density of voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels. in earlier
work, cultured mouse astrocytes expressing l-type
voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels demonstrated quite
different responses to high [k⫹]o, ranging from elevation to a significant decrease depending on the age of
the culture (23). in our experiments, observations
showed that [ca2⫹]i increased only during the first 2–5
min and then returned to near basal levels. a subsequent secondary long-lasting [ca2⫹]i rise was rarely
seen. the specificity of this secondary response may be
placed in doubt, and it may be ascribed to unstable ca2⫹
levels over long time intervals employed in our experiments. therefore, the gradual increase of amino acid
efflux always observed during the whole period of
exposure to high [k⫹]o is not associated with a general
measured rise in [ca2⫹]i.
in contrast to ca2⫹-free medium, loading of astrocytes with bapta-am potently inhibited the high-[k⫹]oinduced [3h]taurine release even in ca2⫹-containing
medium. as verified by measurements of fura 2 fluorescence, exposure to bapta-am decreased [ca2⫹]i to
45–60 nm, which is close to the minimal [ca2⫹]i of 50
nm required for activation of volume-dependent anion
channels in vascular endothelial cells (53). however, in
different cell types, the dependence on [ca2⫹]i may vary.
in ehrlich ascites tumor cells, volume-activated anion
currents were observed at [ca2⫹]i buffered to 25 nm
(42).
a possible problem with [ca2⫹]i measurements is
that the average fura 2 signal does not accurately
reflect local ca2⫹ concentration, which may by of primary influence. if we compare fig. 1g with fig. 1i, it
may be seen that loading with bapta-am led to fast
cell swelling within 2 min, whereas the average ca2⫹
concentration dropped below a presumed ‘‘permissive’’
level within 4–6 min. why didn’t we observe any
immediate volume-dependent taurine release? the ex-

planation may be that local [ca2⫹]i near the membrane
is decreased faster than the average measurable [ca2⫹]i.
in ca2⫹-free medium (fig. 1, d and e) or when lower
ca2⫹ chelator concentrations were applied (fig. 2),
isosmotic cell swelling did induce taurine release. an
additional issue has been recently raised by speake et
al. (49) who showed that the lack of [ca2⫹]i elevation in
lacrimal acinar cells loaded with fura 2 and exposed to
hyposmotic medium is artifactual due to buffering of
cytosolic ca2⫹ by fura 2. rvd in these cells was also
suppressed when they were loaded with fura 2. we did
not find any significant effect of loading with fura 2 on
high-k⫹-induced taurine release and cell volume
changes in our preparation. therefore, even if fura 2
increased intracellular ca2⫹ buffering capacity and
interfered with high-[k⫹]o-induced internal ca2⫹ rise,
which we cannot completely exclude, it was not significant to affect volume-dependent processes induced
under high-[k⫹]o conditions.
involvement of calmodulin in high-[k⫹]o-induced cell
swelling and taurine release from cultured astrocytes.
the main intracellular pathway for ca2⫹-dependent
regulation of cellular processes is activation of calmodulin and subsequent stimulation of ca2⫹/calmodulindependent enzymes such as protein kinases (4, 31). it is
well established that calmodulin is involved in hyposmotic medium-induced rvd and electrolyte efflux in
many cell types (21, 26), including cultured astrocytes
(2, 3, 58). because swelling under conditions of raised
k⫹ differs from hyposmotic swelling with respect to
both the rate and the magnitude of the volume changes,
different ion transport and intracellular signaling
mechanisms may be activated (50). to our knowledge,
no data exist on the involvement of calmodulin in
high-[k⫹]o-induced astrocytic cell volume increase and
associated amino acid fluxes. we found that the reversible calmodulin antagonist  xxxd3431xxx  potently and
reversibly inhibited high-[k⫹]o-evoked taurine release.
the ic50 of ⬃10 µm for this inhibition was comparable
to the kd of 5.8 µm for binding of  xxxd3431xxx  to
calmodulin in vitro (25). the irreversible calmodulin
antagonist fluphenazine also produced irreversible effects in our system.
is activation of volume-sensitive anion channel(s) or
(k⫹ ⫹ cl⫺ ) accumulation under high-k⫹ conditions the
calmodulin-dependent step(s)? in the case of hyposmotic swelling, calmodulin antagonists did not affect
astrocytic volume increase but did inhibit rvd (2, 58).
the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3431xxx  on the early
rates of [3h]taurine release in hyposmotic medium thus
shows that the volume-dependent anion channel itself
or volume signal transduction machinery is a likely
target for calmodulin antagonists. however, if we calculated the effect of  xxxd3431xxx  on total area of the
hyposmotic medium-induced [3h]taurine release, it
seemed less inhibited compared with the maximal
fractional percent release (fig. 4e). this was in contrast to uniform effects of the drug on maximal release
rate and area of high-[k⫹]o-induced release (fig. 4e).
we explain this paradox by the effect of  xxxd3431xxx 
on volume regulation. prolonged hyposmotic cell swelling in the presence of  xxxd3431xxx  (2, 58) masks the

role of [ca2⫹]i in volume-dependent taurine release

inhibitory effect of the drug on the anion channel. as
shown in fig. 4d, 25 µm  xxxd3431xxx  clearly inhibited the initial hyposmotic [3h]taurine release, whereas,
at the 7th-10th min of exposure, we see a stimulation
compared with control release. thus the high sensitivity of the k⫹-evoked [3h]taurine release to calmodulin
antagonists may involve two mechanisms, i.e., a direct
effect on the anion channel or channel regulatory
machinery and via suppression of high-[k⫹]o-induced
cell swelling (fig. 4f).
does high-k⫹-induced and hyposmotic mediuminduced taurine release from cultured astrocytes involve
different transport and signaling mechanisms? both
hyposmotic- and high-[k⫹]o-induced [3h]taurine release in our experiments were sensitive to chelation of
intracellular ca2⫹ and calmodulin inhibitors, revealing
a qualitative similarity of volume-dependent transport
and signaling mechanisms under both conditions. however, a more detailed comparison of the bapta-am
and  xxxd3431xxx  effects showed some differences.
thus high-k⫹-induced [3h]taurine release was more
sensitive to both [ca2⫹]i chelation and calmodulin inhibition. a reasonable explanation for this is the inhibitory effects on (k⫹ ⫹ cl⫺ ) accumulation and cell
swelling. this is true in the case of calmodulin inhibitors but seems unlikely for the action of intracellular
ca2⫹ chelators. alternatively, it could be that different
types of anion channels contribute to hyposmotic medium- and high-[k⫹]o medium-induced [3h]taurine release. our recent observation on two components of
hyposmotically induced [3h]taurine efflux, sensitive
and insensitive to inhibition of tyrosine kinases, supports the latter possibility (29). we have found that
k⫹-evoked astrocytic d-[3h]aspartate release also requires permissive [ca2⫹]i and is sensitive to bapta-am
loading, similar to high-[k⫹]o-induced taurine release
(28). it has been shown that loading of brain cells in
vivo with ca2⫹ chelators strongly reduces ischemic
brain injury, which was explained by prevention of
excitotoxic neuronal death (55). some component of
protection by chelators may be due to inhibition of
excitatory amino acid (eaa) release from astrocytes
(16). it also seems that calmodulin inhibitors may be
useful in the search for new pharmacological agents for
treatment of ischemia and brain edema. possible roles
for their action include prevention of cytotoxic cell
swelling and suppression of volume-dependent eaa
release.
in conclusion, volume-dependent [3h]taurine release
requires a permissive level of [ca2⫹]i, in agreement
with an earlier observed requirement of a volumedependent anion channel for [ca2⫹]i (53). however,
high-[k⫹]o medium- and hyposmotic medium-induced
amino acid release show quantitative differences in
intracellular ca2⫹ sensitivity. this may be due to
multiple anion transport pathways activated under
hyposmotic conditions, as was established in a recent
study (29), some of which may be ca2⫹ insensitive or
possesses low ca2⫹ sensitivity. in addition, high-[k⫹]oinduced astrocytic swelling is insensitive (or possesses
low sensitivity) to alterations of extracellular and intracellular ca2⫹ concentration. calmodulin inhibitors sup-

 xxxd2062xxx 

press both the hyposmotic medium-induced and to a
larger extent the high-[k⫹]o-evoked [3h]taurine release
and also inhibit high-[k⫹]o-induced cell swelling. therefore, the pronounced effects of calmodulin antagonists
on the high-[k⫹]o-induced taurine release likely involve
both a direct effect on the swelling-activated channel or
channel regulatory machinery and an indirect action
via inhibition of cell swelling.
