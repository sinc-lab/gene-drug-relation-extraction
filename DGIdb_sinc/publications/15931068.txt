the aim of this study was to evaluate the psychophysical e¡ects of
both trpa1 and  xxxg2334xxx  activation in humans by application of
either cinnamaldehyde or menthol. we applied 10% cinnamaldehyde or 40% menthol solutions on the forearm in 10 study participants.quantitative sensory testing and laser doppler imaging was
performed before and after exposure to the compounds. cinnamaldehyde evoked signi¢cant spontaneous pain and induced heat

and mechanical hyperalgesia, cold hypoalgesia and a neurogenic
axon re£ex erythema. in contrast,  xxxg2334xxx  activation by menthol
produced no axon re£ex reaction and resulted in cold hyperalgesia.
we conclude that agonists of trpa1 and  xxxg2334xxx  channels
produce strikingly di¡erent psychophysical patterns. neuroreport

introduction
moderate cooling of the skin primarily induces a pure
sensation of cold. however, further decreases in temperature lead to a painful cold sensation with a burning,
pricking or aching component [1]. at the level of the
primary afferent neuron, reduced skin temperature activates
thinly myelinated a-delta fibres and unmyelinated c-fibres.
pressure blocks of a-fibres lead to loss of cold sensation
upon cooling and instead provoke a painful heat sensation,
distinguishing their role in conducting the cold sensation
[2]. recent studies suggest that the sensation of cold pain
results from integrated activity in a nociceptive pathway
common for both noxious heat and cold along with activity
in nonnociceptive thermal systems, rather than from
activation of a specific noxious cold pathway [3–5]. such
convergence of cold and heat pain and divergence of
innocuous cool and noxious cold can be found at both
peripheral and central levels of the nervous system [6,7].
the recent molecular cloning of the cold-activated ion
channels of the transient receptor potential (trp) family,
 xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1, allows more insight in the coding of
cold-activated primary afferent neurons. both channels are
expressed on dorsal root ganglion (drg) cells.  xxxg2334xxx  is
activated by temperatures lower than 251c [8]. selective
activation of afferent fibres expressing this ion channel by
menthol induces a sensation of coldness, pain and cold
hyperalgesia [2]. however, not much is known about the
coding of trpa1-expressing afferent neurons. trpa1 is
activated by temperatures in a more noxious range, below
181c. it is expressed on a subset of peptidergic small
diameter drg cells in mice and coexpression with the

noxious heat-activated ion channel trpv1 has been
reported [9–11]. trpa1 is activated by pungent compounds
like cinnamaldehyde (ca) and mustard oil. among tested
substances ca has been shown to be the most selective
trpa1 activator [9]. to further elucidate the contributions of
 xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1 to the somatosensory system, we
investigated the psychophysical effects of ca and menthol
in humans. we report that  xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1 activation in
humans leads to different psychophysical patterns.

materials and methods
ten healthy study participants (seven men, three women,
mean age 33.772.1 years) took part in the present study. the
volunteers were informed about the purpose of the study
and gave their informed consent but were naive to the
specific experimental goals. the study was approved by the
local ethics committee.
we used a double-blinded and randomized cross-over
design. psychophysical experiments were conducted in two
different runs for each of the two substances. in each run,
detection thresholds for cold, warm, cold pain and heat pain
were measured with a thermotest device before and after
application of the substance. evoked sensations were
registered during the period of application of the substance.
after removal of the substance, skin was tested for
mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia. the control vehicle
was applied to the contralateral forearm, using the same
experimental setting. the laser doppler imaging experiments for observing changes in superficial blood flow were
performed in a separate experimental series.

 xxxd2565xxx  (sigma-aldrich, munich, germany) was
applied as a 40% w/v solution in ethanol (99.8%).
trans-cinnamaldehyde (99%, sigma-aldrich, munich,
germany) was applied as a 10% v/v solution in ethanol
(99.8%). the control solution was ethanol (99.8%). preliminary testing revealed that 10% ca solution was the ideal
balance between incomplete effects and excessive pain or
flare reactions. the respective substances (200 ml) were
applied on a 2.5  5 cm cellulose pad, which was placed
under a 2.5  5 cm silicon chamber on the skin to avoid
evaporation and leakage. to make sure that the participant
and the experimenter could not identify the applied
substance by its characteristic smell, a pot containing 50 ml
of a 30% mustard oil solution with smaller amounts of
cinnamon oil and menthol was placed near the two persons
in an attempt to mask the strong smell of the applied
substance. sensory ratings were obtained every minute
during drug application, starting at the point of the first
contact with the substance, until its removal 20 min later.
participants were asked to rate pain, temperature (warm
or cold) and itch on a numeric rating scale (nrs), ranging
from 0 (no sensation) to 10 (maximum of the sensation).
temperature detection thresholds and pain thresholds were
determined on the volar forearm using a peltier driven
thermotest device (slope 11c/s, method of limits, threshold
determined as the average of three successive stimuli,
randomized interstimulus intervals) with a probe size of
2.5  5 cm (msa, somedic, horby, sweden). areas hyperalgesic to pinprick were assessed using a 254 mn von frey
bristle with a flat tip (diameter 0.2 mm). the area of
hyperalgesia was determined along two orthogonal trajectories by testing pinprick sensitivity radially each 0.5 cm
from the centre in both directions. dynamic mechanical
allodynia was tested by applying gentle strokes with a cotton
wool swab perpendicular to the two trajectories. static
mechanical allodynia was tested by applying gentle pressure
using a cotton wool swab whose handle was calibrated to a
force of 100 mn. the experiments for scrutinizing a direct
vasodilation or axon reflex flare reaction were performed by
applying one of either of the two substances and the control
solution simultaneously on the volar part of the right and left
forearm, respectively. the solution (100 ml) was applied to a
cellulose pad that was placed inside a plastic ring (1.6 cm
inner diameter and 2 mm high) and this was fixed to the skin
with silicon. a laser doppler imager (ldi) (moore, london,
uk) was used to measure the area of increased vasodilation.
the spatial resolution of each scan was 0.5 mm. scans were
made at intervals of 3 min with two baseline scans made
before the period of substance application and three thereafter. the area of vasodilation was analysed offline with
mldi 3.0 and 3.08 software (moore). vasodilatation was
considered to be a pixel with a value greater than the mean
plus two standard deviations of pixel values determined
from the scans made prior to substance application. the
wilcoxon matched pairs test was used for statistical evaluation. p valueso0.05 were considered to be significant. all
values are given as means7sem.

described its quality as burning. furthermore, ca induced
a sensation of warmth in all participants, which occurred
with a time latency of 6 min and reached its maximum nrs
value of 3.570.78 after 18 min (fig. 1b). ethanol evoked a
weak sensation of pain in one participant (nrs 1) and
a sensation of warmth in two participants (maximum nrs 4
and 5). ca induced itch in six participants, while ethanol
induced itch in two participants. menthol evoked pain in
seven of the 10 participants. the pain occurred with a
latency of onset of 4 min and reached its maximum nrs
value of 3.270.83 after 16 min. menthol evoked a sensation
of coldness within the area of application in seven of the 10
participants. the coldness occurred with a latency of onset
of 5 min and reached its maximum nrs value of 3.670.81
after 17 min. the three participants who felt no coldness
instead felt warmth during the application of menthol.
ca and menthol induced different changes in temperature detection thresholds and pain thresholds as shown in
table 1.
in detail, ca induced heat hyperalgesia (fig. 2a) and cold
hypoalgesia (fig. 2b). ca, as well as ethanol, also induced

an increase in cold detection threshold (p¼0.009 and
p¼0.005). only menthol induced a decrease in cold pain
threshold (p¼0.005).
both substances induced pinprick hyperalgesia in the area
of application and surrounding areas as shown in table 2.
only one participant with ca and two with menthol
reported mechanical allodynia.
ca, but not menthol or ethanol, produced a significant
increase of the area of elevated superficial blood flow
outside the area of stimulation, as depicted in fig. 3a.
however, both substances evoked a local vasodilation inside
the area of application (fig. 3b).

discussion
we have demonstrated that in humans, topical application
of ca elicits burning pain but no sensation of cold. this is in
agreement with two previous studies finding that ca
evokes a burning and tingling sensation when administered
to oral mucosa [12,13]. in addition, we demonstrated that
the compound induces heat and mechanical hyperalgesia
and produces an axon reflex flare reaction. ca has been
proven to be the most selective trpa1 activator [9] known.
however, only trpv1, trpv4 and  xxxg2334xxx  were shown not
to be activated by ca. therefore, we currently cannot
exclude the fact that ca may also activate ion channels
other than trpa1. the effect of cold on trpa1 is still a
matter of discussion [9,10]. also, on the cellular level, it was
shown that some (27%) of the ca responsive neurons were
cold insensitive, so that we cannot rule out the assumption
that ion channels affected by ca are expressed in more than
one subpopulation. most of the available data regarding
trpa1 were obtained in vitro or from animal studies. in this

context, it should be noted that human and rodent
nociceptors have different properties so that the data are
not necessarily transferable [14]. however, being aware of
the limitations mentioned above, this is the first study
comparing the effects of potential trpa1 and  xxxg2334xxx 
activators in humans.
our observation that ca elicits burning pain but no cold
sensation has important implications on the supposed
sensory functions of trpa1-expressing afferent neurons.
burning is usually associated with heat. however, both
noxious heat and noxious cold have a component of burning
[1]. therefore, trpa1-expressing nerve fibres may be
relevant for the burning component of cold pain. ca
induces heat hyperalgesia in the application area. heat
hyperalgesia is thought to primarily involve trpv1 [15] and
it was shown that trpa1 is coexpressed with trpv1 [11], so
the activation of trpa1 could lead to a cross-sensitization of
trpv1. this hypothesis is supported by the observation
that wild-type mice show pain-related behaviour and heat
hyperalgesia upon application of ca. in contrast this heat
hyperalgesia is absent in trpv1/ mice [9]. hence, acute
pain induced by ca seems to be independent of trpv1 and
is most probably mediated through trpa1 activation while
heat hyperalgesia would be mediated through sensitization
of trpv1. alternatively, the induced vasodilation leads to
an increased blood flow. as a consequence of a higher
temperature in the subepidermal parts of the skin, a
decrease of the heat pain threshold may result [16].
interestingly, ca leads to cold hypoalgesia. strong stimulation by ca may result in desensitization of activated
nociceptors to cold. adaptation has been described after
repeated exposure of oral mucosa to ca [12]. furthermore,
an increased blood flow could result in an elevated
temperature in deeper cutaneous tissues, producing a
greater temperature gradient between the epidermal layer
and the deeper cutaneous tissues. both ca solution and the
vehicle ethanol increased the cool perception threshold. this
effect was described previously for ethanol [17] and could

and dynamic hyperalgesia [20]. the difference may be
attributed to a relatively weaker efficacy of the algesic
compound or to a smaller proportion of activated fibres [9].
our laser doppler imaging studies demonstrate that ca
evokes a robust axon reflex flare vasodilation in humans.
axon reflex flare is induced by antidromically activated
branches of c-nociceptors releasing the vasoactive neuropeptide cgrp [19]. in humans, two different classes of
c-nociceptors are known. the polymodal or mechanosensitive nociceptors (c-mh) are responsive to mechanical
stimuli and heat while mechanoinsensitive nociceptors
(c-mi) become responsive to mechanical stimuli only after
sensitization and their activation induces long-lasting pain.
these c-mi afferents are crucially involved in neurogenic
inflammation and long-lasting burning pain and are
predominantly involved in the production of axon reflex
flare [19,21]. ca produces an axon reflex flare, a long-lasting
burning pain sensation and primary hyperalgesia. this
indicates that trpa1 is likely to be expressed on c-mi
fibres. it is not known whether these fibres respond to cold
stimuli. however, approximately 40% of the mechanically
and heat-sensitive cmh fibres (polymodal nociceptors)
respond to noxious low temperature [22,23] and, therefore,
part of the units activated by ca may be polymodal
nociceptors. polymodal c-mh nociceptors may not produce
a widespread axon reflex flare because of their small
receptive field [22].
it should be noted that ca evoked a concomitant
sensation of itch in six of the 10 participants tested. this
could be due to ca-provoked mast cell degranulation or,
alternatively, a direct activation of itch fibres via trpa1. itch
fibres belong to the class of mechanoinsensitive fibres [24].
however, the flare response was present in all participants,
not only those reporting itch. because itching was not
present in all participants after ca application, it is unlikely
that the axon reflex flare was induced only indirectly by
activation of histamine-sensitive fibres. in contrast to ca,
menthol induced no axon reflex flare reaction. cutaneous
perfusion measurements done previously by another group
[2] led to converse results. this could be due to a different
methodological approach (single-point probe). however,
our results indicate that there is a local vasodilation induced
by menthol that results in a local skin reaction [25]. our
findings provide evidence that moderate cooling sensed by
 xxxg2334xxx  is, in contrast to the putatively noxious coldactivated trpa1, not mediated by c-mi afferent units.

conclusion
be attributed to a local vasodilatory effect of ethanol.
menthol and ca induced pinprick hyperalgesia in the area
of application and surrounding skin. emerging evidence
suggests that pinprick hyperalgesia involves sensitization of
central neurons that is induced by ongoing activity in
sensitized c-nociceptors (secondary hyperalgesia) [18].
furthermore, the effect could also be caused by peripheral
sensitization of nociceptive endings as shown for capsaicin
(primary hyperalgesia) [19]. static or dynamic mechanical
allodynia was found neither after menthol nor after ca
exposure. this is surprising, because ca may activate a
fraction of the same population of nociceptive endings as
capsaicin and capsaicin has been reported to result in static

topical application of cinnamaldehyde elicits burning pain
but no sensation of cold and induces heat allodynia and an
axon reflex flare reaction. in contrast, menthol induces pain,
a cold sensation and cold allodynia but no axon reflex flare
reaction. therefore, we provide evidence for a different
coding of cinnamaldehyde and menthol-sensitive nociceptive nerve endings.
