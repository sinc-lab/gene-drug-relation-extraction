approved recombinant human
 xxxg1847xxx ,  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) (xigris
lilly), for the reduction of
mortality in patients with
severe sepsis associated with
acute organ system dysfunction on november 21, 2001.

severe s epsis
despite the development of
new antimicrobial agents and
improved strategies for supportive care, sepsis remains a
significant cause of mortality
in critically ill patients. over
750,000 cases of sepsis occur
each year in the united states,
approximately 30% of which
result in fatality.1
the sepsis cascade is initiated by infection or tissue injury
that results in a local immune
response involving host
inflammatory mediators. as a
part of homeostasis, this
inflammatory response is normally balanced by the release
of anti-inflammatory mediators. in some patients, an
excess of inflammatory mediators causes a systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(sirs), which includes fever
or hypothermia, leukocytosis
or leukopenia, tachycardia,
and tachypnea. in the setting

of a presumed or confirmed
infection, patients with sirs
are defined as having sepsis.
exaggerated release of
inflammatory mediators may
lead to abnormalities in hemodynamic response and
hypotension, vascular
endothelial injury, activation
of coagulation, and inhibition
of profibrinolysis. these
pathophysiologic factors of
sepsis may ultimately result in
development of acute organ
system dysfunction from
hypoperfusion, microvascular
thrombosis, or both. a patient
is considered to have severe
sepsis when infection and
sirs progress to acute dysfunction of the cardiovascular,
renal, respiratory, hepatic,
hematologic, or central nervous system or to unexplained
metabolic acidosis.2

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
is a recombinant form of
human  xxxg1847xxx

va and viiia. additionally, in
vitro data suggest that apc
may offer anti-inflammatory
and indirect profibrinolytic
activity. the anti-inflammatory activity of apc may be due
to inhibition of production of
human  xxxg2296xxx ,
blockade of leukocyte adhesion, and limitation of thrombin-induced inflammatory
responses at the endothelial
cell surface. the indirect
profibrinolytic activity of apc
is related to its ability to inhibit plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 (pai-1) and to limit generation of activated
 xxxg503xxx  (tafi).3,4

c linical trials
the recombinant human
 xxxg1847xxx  worldwide evaluation in severe
sepsis (prowess) trial was
an international, multicenter,
randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that
evaluated the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in severe sepsis.
prowess was conducted
from july 1998 through june
2000 at 164 centers in 11
countries. a total of 1,690
patients were assigned to
receive the study drug (850) or
placebo (840). enrolled
patients had to have a known
or suspected infection as evidenced by the presence of at
least three sirs criteria and at
least one sepsis-induced organ
dysfunction that lasted no
longer than 24 hours. furthermore, therapy had to be initiated within 24 hours after a
patient was found to meet the
inclusion criteria. patients with
immunosuppression or high

risk of bleeding were generally
excluded from the trial. the
primary end point of patient
assessment was death from
any cause at 28 days. patients
randomized to the drug arm of
the study received drotrecogin
alfa (activated) at 24 mcg/kg/
hour by continuous infusion
for 96 hours. all other treatment and supportive measures
for severe sepsis were left to
the discretion of the center
staff providing care.
prowess was prematurely halted by fda at the second planned interim analysis
following detection of a significant mortality benefit with
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
versus placebo (24.7% versus
30.8%, p = .005). hence, there
was a 6.1% absolute reduction
in risk of death that translates
to a 19.4% reduction in relative risk of death. a kaplanmeier analysis illustrates the
effect of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) on survival of patients
with severe sepsis over the 28day study period.5
several subsets were
prospectively defined for mortality analysis, including a
subset defined by the acute
physiology and chronic
health evaluation ii
(apache ii)6 score. the
apache ii score is an
assessment tool designed to
determine risk of mortality.
for analysis, patients were
divided into quartiles based on
their apache ii scores. a
correlation was found
between baseline apache ii
score and risk of death, with
the observed mortality benefit
being limited to patients with
apache ii scores 25, i.e.,
patients in the third and fourth
quartiles (see table 1). study

adverse effects,
contraindications,
and w arnings
bleeding was the most
common adverse effect associated with  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated). the incidence of
serious bleeding events during
the 28-day study period was
higher in the  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) group than in the
placebo group (3.5% versus
2.0%, p = .06). drotrecogin
alfa (activated) is contraindicated in clinical situations in
which bleeding may be associated with a high risk of death:
active internal bleeding.
hemorrhagic stroke within
the last 3 months.
intracranial or intraspinal
surgery, or severe head
trauma within the last 2
months.
trauma with an increased
risk of life-threatening
bleeding.
presence of an epidural

catheter.
intracranial neoplasm,
mass lesion, or evidence of
cerebral herniation.
when evaluating patients
who may receive drotrecogin
alfa (activated), the potential
benefits and risks of therapy
must be carefully considered
if one or more of the following conditions are present:
concurrent therapeutic
heparin ( 15 units/kg/
hour).
platelet count < 30,000
106/l, even if the platelet
count is increased after
transfusions.
international normalized
ratio > 3.0.
gastrointestinal bleeding
within the last 6 weeks.
thrombolytic therapy
within the last 3 days.
oral anticoagulants or glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors
within the last 7 days.
aspirin > 650 mg/day or
other platelet inhibitors
within the last 7 days.
ischemic stroke within the
last 3 months.
intracranial arteriovenous
malformation or aneurysm.
known bleeding diathesis.

chronic severe hepatic
disease.
any other condition in
which bleeding constitutes
a significant hazard or
would be particularly difficult to manage because of
its location.
infusion of  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) should be interrupted at least 2 hours prior to
performing any invasive surgical procedures or other procedures with a risk of bleeding.
the infusion may be restarted
immediately following
uncomplicated, minimally
invasive procedures. following more invasive surgical
procedures, initiation of
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
may be reconsidered after at
least 12 hours and once
hemostasis has been
achieved.4

dosage and
adm inistration
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) should be administered
by continuous intravenous
infusion at a rate of 24
mcg/kg/hour for a total of 96
hours. as little compatibility

data exist for the intravenous
solution, it should be administered via a dedicated line or
dedicated lumen of a multilumen central venous
catheter. administration
must be completed within
12 hours of reconstitution.
periods during which the
infusion may be interrupted
for procedures with an inherent risk of bleeding do not
count toward the 96-hour
duration of therapy.

cost of therapy
the wholesale prices for
5 mg and 20 mg vials of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) are
$210 and $840, respectively.
a 96-hour infusion for a 70 kg
patient costs approximately
$6,800. each additional kilogram of patient weight adds
approximately $100 to the
cost of therapy.
hospital pharmacists may
be able to proactively reduce
costs by developing utilization
criteria to ensure appropriate
selection of patients most likely to benefit from drotrecogin
alfa (activated) therapy. education of nurses as well as

costs associated with product
wastage.

sum m ary
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
is a recombinant form of
human  xxxg1847xxx 
that has been shown to reduce
mortality in severely septic
patients with a high risk of

death. given the complexity
of the inclusion and exclusion
criteria, the stability and
unique duration of infusion,
and the cost of treatment,
therapy with this agent should
be carefully considered to
ensure its appropriate use.

aspirin: past, present, and future
aspirin is the most widely used drug in the world. americans alone ingest 29 billion aspirin tablets each year. its longevity
(104 years) and public acceptance is probably unsurpassed by any other drug.
aspirin is the synthetic acetyl derivative of  xxxd3159xxx  (sa). sa occurs in the white willow (salix alba) plant. the ancient
egyptians and sumerians, as well as hippocrates (460–377 bc), dioscorides (40–80 ad), and others, used or mentioned the use
of willow tree bark to relieve pain. in 18th century england, extracts of willow bark were used to alleviate symptoms of malaria.
in europe, buchner (1828) isolated salicin from willow bark. later, piria separated sa from salicin. kolbe (1859) first synthesized sa, which was then mass produced. in 1876 sa was widely adopted as an anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic
to treat rheumatism, but it was very irritating to stomach tissue.1
in 1896 bayer & co. established a research pharmaceutical laboratory in germany, where felix hoffmann was employed as
a chemist. hoffmann’s father was suffering from rheumatism and could not tolerate the adverse effects of sa. this motivated
him to find a substitute, and, after many attempts, he synthesized pure  xxxd234xxx  (asa) in 1897.
h. dreser, a pharmacologist at bayer, tested asa on himself and in animals. after performing clinical studies, he described
asa’s outstanding therapeutic properties, its excellent tolerance by patients, and its lack of the adverse effects usually associated with sa and  xxxd3219xxx .
bayer’s application for a patent on sa was rejected in berlin on the grounds that it was not a new drug since an impure,
unstable form of aspirin had been synthesized by gerhardt in 1853 and by von gilm in 1859.2 bayer marketed the drug under
the trade name “aspirin.” aspirin was the first major drug to be sold in tablet form. in germany, aspirin and generic asa were
well accepted by the general public and often prescribed by physicians. the united states granted bayer a patent for aspirin in
1900. asa became official in the 10th edition of the united states pharmacopeia, which was published in 1926.
will aspirin be replaced by more powerful miracle drugs? my belief is that aspirin has a bright future in modern therapeutics
since many new uses are being investigated. for example, it may be used in preventing colon cancer and to suppress certain
types of tumors.3 aspirin will probably make a smooth transition from its use chiefly as a therapeutic agent to a drug employed
in preventive medicine and from a relatively mild drug to a potent drug that has to be used with care.
