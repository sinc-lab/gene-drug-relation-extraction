y. audigier, h. mazarguil, r. gout and j. cros, structure-activity relationships ofenkephalin analogs
at opiate and enkephalin receptors: correlation with analgesia, european j. pharmacol. 63 (1980) 35--46.
we have investigated the influence of physico-chemical parameters (chemical structure and lipophilicity), biochemical properties (catabolism, affinity for 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding sites and 3h-(d-ala)2-leus-enkephalin amide
binding sites) and biological activity in isolated organs (guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens) on the regulation of analgesia induced after intracerebroventricular injection of various enkephalin analogs. the selectivity of
these metabolically stable analogs for /.t- and 5-receptors, present in guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens
respectively, depends on the c-terminal amino acid and also on the nature of the second d-amino-acid. a strong
correlation exists between activity in guinea-pig ileum and affinity for 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding sites suggesting that
these sites in rat brain have properties identical to those of /~-receptors characterized in guinea-pig ileum.
similarly, the affinity for 3h-(d-ala)~-leus-enkephalin amide binding sites in mouse brain is correlated to the
activity in mouse vas deferens and suggests that central ~-receptors are not different from peripheral 5-receptors.
if we consider morphine-like drugs and enkephalin analogs containing the same c-terminal amino acid as the
enkephalins, there is a good correlation between activity on p-receptors (affinity for 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding sites
and activity in guinea-pig ileum) and the antinociceptive activity. these results support the hypothesis that
p-receptors are stronlgy involved in the analgesic effect. however, when proline is the c-terminal amino acid, the
antinociceptive activity was enhanced without any concomitant increase in the affinity. this activity enhancement was the same for each analog and a similar correlation (identical to what was found with other opioid peptides and opiates) could still be established. the reason for such a potentiation of the activity remains to be
elucidated.

1. introduction

the existence of short-chain peptides, the
enkephalins (hughes et al., 1975b) and longchain peptides, fi-endorphin (li and chung,
1976) and fi-lipotropin (li, 1964) localized in
two independent neuronal systems (hskfelt

mouse vas deferens

analgesia

al., 1977; watson et al., 1978} suggested that
all these peptides might serve different
physiological functions which would be
mediated by an interaction with multiple
receptors.
the multiple opiate receptor theory was
first formulated after a pharmacological study
of chronic spinal dogs (martin et al., 1976;
gilbert and martin, 1976). however, none of
the compounds tested was a selective agonist
or antagonist for the proposed p-, ~, or
a-receptors.
in a more convincing manner, lord et al.

36
{1977) have demonstrated the existence of at
least two types of receptors, ~ and 6, in the
guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens
respectively. the fact that naloxone is a more
selective antagonist for ~-receptors than for
~-receptors is good support for these results.
furthermore, enkephalins are more active
agonists of 5-receptors while morphine-like
drugs are more efficient agonists of p-receptors (lord et al., 1977). however, the evidence for two types of receptors was obtained
from peripheral tissues of different species
(lord et al., 1977). although some correlation can be established between the activity
for each type of receptor in the peripheral
tissues and the affinity measured in brain
tissue with the corresponding 3h-ligand, (i.e.
3h-naloxone for ~-receptor and 3h-leucineenkephaiin for 5-receptor) (lord et al., 1977),
neither kind of receptor has yet been isolated
biochemically nor has the regional distribution in the cns been clearly investigated
(della beua et al., 1978). furthermore, the
activity on p- or 5-receptors does not correlate with the main activity induced by these
opioid peptides, i.e. analgesia (kosterlitz,
1978).
differences in catabolism were not ruled
out in these biological studies and such
problems of degradation are important in the
case of enkephalin activity (hughes, 1975;
hambrook et al., 1976; malfroy et al., 1978).
to avoid interference from such metabolic
processes, shaw et al. (1978) studied the
activity of enkephalin analogs derived from
(d-ala)2-mets-enkephalin amide, a compound
known to be resistant to peptidases (pert et
al., 1976; malfroy et al., 1978). however
these authors (shaw et al., 1978) correlated
their findings on isolated organs with intravenously induced analgesia without taking
into account a differential penetration of the
blood-brain barrier for these enkephalin
analogs and also without studying the interaction with the receptor(s).
in the present experiments we have studied
the possible relationship between chemical
structure, catabolism, relative affinity (mea-

of
enkephalin analogs. we report on differences
among enkephalin analogs and the involvement of the c-terminal amino acid in the
analgesic activity. the problem of multiple
opiate receptors and the possible nature of
the receptor involved in analgesia are
discussed.

2. materials and methods

2.1. lipophilicity of enkephalin analogs and
morphine
the hydrophobic properties of the opioid
peptides and morphine were compared using a
liquid chromatograph waters alc 204.
the column, a #bondapak c18/corasil
(inverse phase) was eluted with a hydrophilic
mixture (ch3oh-h20, 1 : 1). the enkephalin
analogs were detected by their absorbance at
254 nm.

2.2. binding measurements
binding studies with 3h- xxxd2070xxx  were
performed on a rat brain homogenate. male
sprague-dawley rats (180--200 g) were killed
by decapitation and the brain removed on ice.
the cerebral tissue (without cerebellum) was
then homogenized with a teflon-glass homogenizer (v= 1,500 rpm; 5 strokes) in 110
volumes 0.05 m tris-hc1 buffer, ph = 7.4.
the crude homogenate (800 /a) was incubated for 20 min at 37°c in the presence of
100 p] 3h- xxxd2070xxx  ( l n m ) and 100 /~1
unlabeued effector. non-specific binding was
determined with 1 pm levorphanol. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 ml cold
 xxxd3449xxx  and the resulting suspension was
filtered under pressure on glass fiber filter
whatman gf/b. the filters were washed
twice with 5 ml  xxxd3449xxx , dried at 120°c
for 15 min then counted in a beckman scintil-

enkephalin analogs,multiple opiate receptors and analgesia
lation counter using a scintillation mixture
with 40% efficiency.
for 3h-(d-ala)2)-leucine~enkephalin amide
binding, a washed homogenate from mouse
brain was used. male swiss mice (18--20 g)
were killed and the homogenate prepared as
before with the following modification: the
homogenate was centrifuged at 49,000g for
10 min and the resulting pellet was homogenized in 10 ml  xxxd3449xxx . after centrifugation (49,000g; 10 m i n ) t h e pellet was
resuspended in sufficient  xxxd3449xxx  to obtain
a final concentration of 1 mg protein per ml.
the binding assay was performed as previously
described using 3.5 nm sh-(d-ala)2-leu senkephalin amide. non-specific binding was
measured in the presence of 1 pm unlabelled
ligand. bound ligand was separated from free
ligand and counted.
the ics0 values were calculated by linear
regression from log-probit plots and each
value is the mean of three or four determinations.

2.3. guinea-pig ileum assay
the inhibitory activity of enkephalin analogs was measured using guinea-pig ileum
according to the method of kosterlitz and
watt (1968).

2.4. mouse vas deferens assay
the agonist potencies of morphine and
opioid peptides were determined using mouse
vas deferens preparations as reported by
hughes et al. (1975c).

2.5. an tinociceptive activity
analgesic activity was measured after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)injection in the
conscious mouse according to the tail flick
method of d'amour and smith (1941). drugs
were dissolved in physiological saline and
injected with a hamilton syringe.

37

2.6. drugs
enkephalin analogs were synthesized by
fragment condensation as described by bfisher
et al. (1976). opiate-like drugs used were:
dextrorphan and levorphanol (gifts from
hoffman-la roche, basle); codeine, morphine and normorphine (gifts from francopia,
paris); oxymorphone and naloxone (gifts
from endo laboratories, new york) ketocyclazocine (gift from sterling-winthrop, new
york); pethidine (gift from rhsne-poulenc,
paris). (d-ala)2-tyrosyl-3,5-3h enkephalin
(5- xxxd2460xxx  a m i d e ) ( 3 9 . 3 c i / m m o l e ) a n d
sh- xxxd2070xxx  (35.4 ci/mmole) were purchased
from the radiochemical center, amersham.

3. results

3.1. lipophilicity o f the enkephalin analogs
we have investigated the influence of some
structural modifications on the lipophilic
character of enkephalin analogs in comparison
to morphine (table 1). this parameter
regulates penetration through the blood-brain
barrier, and consequently modulates the activity of i.v. administered drugs.
all the analogs synthetized were more lipophilic than morphine itself. as could be
expected, when phenylalanine was hydro°
genated to cyclohexylalanine, hydrophobicity
was considerably enhanced. similarly leucine
as the c-terminal amino acid contains a
saturated residue and confers a strong hydrophobic character to the corresponding enkephalin analogs whereas methionine or proline
in the same position are equivalent and more
hydrophilic. the presence of d-alanine or
 xxxd660xxx  as second amino a c i d had
qualitatively similar effects, but  xxxd660xxx 
enhanced the differences previously observed
with the c-terminal amino acid; in fact the
elution volume of (d-met)2-leus-enkephalin
amide was twice that of (d-ala)2-leusenkephalin amide.
all these observations could be well corre-

enkephalin analogs, multiple opiate receptors and analgesia

3.2. metabolic stability of the enkephalin
analogs
it has been shown that replacement of
 xxxd2217xxx  (second amino acid) by  xxxd660xxx  or d-alanine confers marked resistance to
catabolic deactivation (pert et al., 1976;
bajusz et al., 1978; belluzzi et al., 1978). we
investigated the relationship between the
c-terminal amino acid and peptidase degradation for all these analogs. this aspect of
metabolic stability was studied by means of
3h- xxxd2070xxx  bound to crude homogenates
from rat brain which contains a high amount
of peptidases (hambrook et al., 1976). we
then compared the ability of different enkephalin analogs to displace 3h~ xxxd2070xxx 
specific binding before and after a 30 min preincubation.
the data summarized in table 2 show that
these analogs were still able to displace 3hetrophine binding after 30 min. the maximal
variation in displacement efficiency was a
decrease of 6.5% when compared to the activity before preincubation. we can therefore

39

conclude that, with  xxxd660xxx  or d-alanine as the second amino acid, the nature of
the c-terminal amino acid did not modify the
in vitro metabolic stability.

3.3. affinity for 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding sites
the relative affinities of opiates for 3hetorphine binding sites correlated well with
data obtained using o t h e r 3h-opiates (simon
et al., 1973; pert and snyder, 1973; terenius,
1973; simantov et al., 1978; childers et al.,
1979). levorphanol was the most active and
morphine was seven times less efficient
(table 1).
except for cyclohexylated enkephalin
analogs, which are always less active than the
corresponding phenylalanine compounds, all
other derivatives substituted for either the
second or the fifth amino acid had similar
affinities. this mean affinity was identical to
that calculated for morphine. in view of the
similarity of the affinities, the nature of the
c-terminal amino acid and the replacement of
d-alanine by  xxxd660xxx  do not appear
critical for the binding to 3h- xxxd2070xxx  sites.
however, (d-ala):-pros-enkephalin amide
displaced 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding less efficiently
than did other enkephalin analogs.

3.4. affinity for 3h-(d-ala)2-leus-enkephalin
amide binding sites
the order of potency of the opiates was
the same as that observed for 3h- xxxd2070xxx 
binding (table 1).
contrary to 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding studies
which demonstrate a similar activity of morphine and enkephalin analogs in which
phenylalanine is n o t hydrogenated, these last
compounds were five to ten times more active
than morphine in displacing 3h(d-ala)2-leu senkephalin amide binding. these analogs were
equiactive (table 1). here again (d-ala)%pro senkephalin amide which resembles morphine
was less active than other analogs.

3.5. inhibitory activity
stimulated guinea-pig ileum

y. audigier et al.

on

electrically

we have measured the agonist p o t e n c y of
the enkephalin analogs and compared it to
that of morphine, for which we have calculated an ics0 value similar to that reported
b y waterfield et al. (1977) (table 1). in agreement with results above, cyclohexylation
decreased the inhibitory activity in ileum
again suggesting the importance of the
aromatic phenylalanine moiety. the other
analogs are more active than enkephalins
themselves (waterfield et al., 1977) and their
activities are in a similar range of concentrations. the nature of the c-terminal amino
acid did not affect the inhibitory activity in
ileum whereas  xxxd660xxx  compared to
d-alanine as the second amino acid induced a
slight increase.

3.6. inhibitory activity on
stimulated mouse vas deferens

electrically

as previously reported (waterfield et al.,
1977), m o r p h i n e inhibited the activity of
mouse vas deferens less efficiently than that
of guinea-pig ileum (table 1). f u r t h e r m o r e ,
opioid peptides were more active on mouse vas
deferens or had equal activities on both
tissues. with  xxxd660xxx  as the second
amino acid, the activity of enkephalin analogs
was n o t affected by the nature of the
c-terminal amino acid and these derivatives
were equiactive in guinea-pig ileum and mouse
vas deferens. these results would suggest that
 xxxd660xxx ,
independently
from
the
c-terminal amino acid, confers similar activity
on both tissues. however, when d-alanine
replaced  xxxd660xxx , the c-terminal part of
the molecule became more discriminative on
both types of receptors. (d-ala)2-mets-enke phalin amide and (d-ala)2-leus-enkephalin
amide were the most active on mouse vas
deferens
while
(d-ala) 2-pros-enkephalin
amide was much less active than other peptides and its activity compared to its analogs
was thus greater with guinea-pig ileum than

with mouse vas deferens. it must be noted
that (d-ala)2-(6h)4-pros-enkephalin amide
was also more active on guinea pig ileum than
on mouse vas deferens.

3.7. analgesic activity of opiates and enkephalin analogs
to prevent differential penetration through
the blood-brain barrier and to limit metabolic
deactivation, w e compared the antinociceptive properties of opiates and opioid peptides after i.c.v, injection into conscious mice
(table 1).
under these conditions, morphine had an
ads0 of 77 nmol/kg. o x y m o r p h o n e was the
most opiate-like drug (ads0 6 nmol/kg) while
ketocyclazocine was half as active as morphine and its action had a rapid onset and a
very short duration. the modifications of
peptide structure that strongly decrease
metabolic susceptibility (pert et al., 1976;
bajusz et al., 1978) explain their activity at
low doses. the replacement of d-alanine by
 xxxd660xxx  did n o t alter the activity when
the c-terminal amino acid was leucine or
proline. however, (d-met)2-mets-enkephalin
amide was six times more active than
(d-ala)lmets-enkephalin amide. cyclohexylation again induced a decrease in antinociceptive activity. although met s- or leus-analogs
had analgesic activities similar to that of morphine, pros-analogs were considerably more
active than morphine. this is the result of
proline being the c-terminal amino acid and
n o t of an additive effect of  xxxd660xxx  and
proline.

3.8. relationship between the biochemical
and pharmacological studies
the positive correlations which could be
established are summarized in table 3. there
is a good correlation between the relative
affinity of opioid peptides for 3h- xxxd2070xxx 
binding sites and their activity on guinea-pig
ileum. furthermore there is a strong c o , e l a tion between the relative affinities for all-

(d-ala)lleus-enkephalin amide binding sites
and the agonist potency on mouse vas
deferens. these data indicate that biochemical
experiments can substitute for pharmacological studies on isolated organs although the
tissues where activity is determined are differ-

ent from the tissue where affinity is measured.
if we consider all the enkephalin analogs, it
is impossible to correlate the activity on
either #-receptors or ~-receptors with the
antinociceptive activity. however, as shown in

enkephalin analogs,multiple opiate receptors and analgesia
figs. 1 and 2, if we do not take the proline
analogs into account, a better correlation can
be established between the activity on guineapig ileum and the analgesic activity and there
is a quite significant correlation (p < 0.10)
between the affinity for 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding
and the antinociceptive potency. furthermore
proline analogs form a homogenous group in
which activities are approximately ten times
greater than those of other peptides although
the affinities are very similar; consequently a
correlation can also be established for these
analogs between/~-activity and analgesic activity and the data are quite comparable to that
obtained for other opioid peptides and
opiates (figs. 1 and 2).

4. discussion

the aim of this work was to investigate
thoroughly the various factors that determine
the activity of enkephalin analogs in relation
to the problem of multiple opiate receptors.
to decrease metabolic deactivation and its
consequence for the activity, we have synthetized enkephalin analogs whose structures
have been reported to be resistant to the
action of peptidases (pert et ai., 1976;
malfroy et al., 1978; bajusz et al., 1978) and
to induce analgesia at low doses (pert et al.,
1976; bajusz et al., 1977).
if we now consider the different steps that
a drug undergoes after i.v. administration, the
first problem concerns the passage of this
drug through the blood-brain barrier. the
lipophilic character of the molecule is an
important requirement for this penetration
into cerebral tissue. in this context, it is noteworthy that all enkephalin analogs studied
were more hydrophobic than morphine itself
a n d thus penetrated more easily into brain
tissue after i.v. administration. the nature of
the c-terminal amino acid considerably modified the lipophilic character; when it was
leucine, which is a saturated amino acid and
introduces high hydrophobic properties, the
difference between active doses on i.v. and on

43

i.c.v, administration should have been less. on
the contrary, when the c-terminal amino acid
was proline or methionine, it conferred a
more hydrophilic character and could thus
explain the marked differences observed on
i.v. and on i.c.v, injections (bajusz et al.,
1977). these data could therefore be related
to results reported by shaw et al. (1978) for
the i.v. administration of enkephalin analogs.
these authors found a slight difference
between the analgesic ads0 after i.v. administration for (d-ala)2-pros-enkephalin amide
(0.95 m g / k g ) a n d for (d-met)2-leus~nkephalin (2.2 mg/kg). after i.c.v, injection, we
have observed considerable variations since
(d-ala)2-pros-enkephalin amide (2.6 nmol/kg)
was 25 times more active than (d-met)2-leusenkephalin amide (61.5 nmol/kg). t h i s
striking feature could have resulted from the
different lipophilic properties which considerably affect the penetration into brain of
less hydrophobic analogs such as (d-ala) 2:
pros-enkephalin amide. another example is
the inactivity even at 50 mg/kg after i.v.
infusion that shaw et al. (1978) found for
(d-ala)2-mets-enkephalin amide. this enkephalin analog is one of the least lipophilic
compounds and the least active drug for
induction of analgesia. the potency ratio
appears to be independent of this mode of
administration since similar results were
found for some analogs after intracisternal
(ueda et al., 1979) and i.c.v, injection in
mice, suggesting that pharmacokinetic parameters are not involved in the differential activity of these analogs.
the second step occurring after penetration
through the blood-brain barrier is binding to
the receptor site where pharmacological
action is initiated. the homogenity of receptors must therefore be considered, since the
existence of multiple opiate receptors has
been postulated (martin et al., 1976; gilbert
and martin, 1976; lord et al., 1978; shaw
et al., 1978; chang and cuatrecasas, 1979).
in order to investigate the possibility of
multiple binding sites, we have studied the
interaction of opioid peptides on the binding

44

sites labelled b y two agonist ligands, one with
a structure resembling that of opiate-like
drugs, 3h- xxxd2070xxx , and the other with a
peptidic structure derived from enkephalins,
3h-(d-ala)2-leus-enkephalin amide. as previously described (audigier et al., 1977; lord et
al., 1977; waterfield et al., 1977; simantov
et al., 1978; kosterlitz et al., 1978; childers
et al., 1979; chang et al., 1979), opiate-like
drugs are more effective competitors for the
3h-peptide site, i.e. 3h-(d-ala)2-leus-enke phalin amide. the reverse situation appears
not to be the case, since the k1 extrapolated
from the data with a competitive mechanism
assumed, for the displacement of 3h- xxxd2070xxx  and 3h-(d-ala)2-leus-enkephalin amide
binding b y enkephalin analogs are very
similar. thus the relative affinities which we
determined for enkephalin analogs using
either 3h- xxxd2070xxx  or 3h-(d-ala):-leus-enke phalin amide are equivalent. except for
(d-ala)2-pros-enkephalin amide, which is less
active than other opioid peptides, substitutions such as (d-ala) 2 or (d-met) 2 instead o f
(l-gly) 2 or such as (met) s, (leu) s or (pro) s
did n o t induce considerable variations in the
affinity for the t w o different 3h-ligand
binding sites.
the third step which follows receptor
binding is a complex chain of events which
leads to the pharmacological action. this
activity can be determined in isolated peripheral tissues, i.e. guinea-pig ileum (kosterlitz and
watt, 1968) and mouse vas deferens (hughes
et al., 1975a). however, since the binding
studies were not performed in the same tissue
as used for the pharmacological study, the
biological model should correlate well with
biochemical investigations. we in fact found
an excellent correlation between the relative
affinities measured with 3h- xxxd2070xxx  and the
activity determined on guinea-pig ileum.
these data clearly suggest that the 3h- xxxd2070xxx  binding site in the rat brain has properties similar to those of the receptor which
mediates the depressant activity of opioid
peptides or opiates on the electrically
stimulated guinea-pig ileum. lord et al.,

y. a u d i g i e r et al.

(1977) found similar relations between activity on guinea-pig ileum and affinity measured
with 3h-naloxone on guinea-pig brain. identical conclusions could be drawn from comparisons of the activity of opiates and enkephalin
analogs on mouse vas deferens and their
affinity measured on guinea-pig brain with
3h-leucine-enkephalin at 0°c (lord et al.,
1977). we have obtained similar data for
3h(d-ala2-leus-enkephalin amide binding to
receptors from mouse brain at 37°c, since the
affinities of opioid peptides and morphine in
the presence o f this ligand are strongly correlated with their activity on mouse vas
deferens. consequently, the biochemical and
pharmacological studies are in good agreement. we can therefore conclude that the 3hopiate binding site in whole brain represents
the p-receptor found in guinea-pig ileum and
that the 3h-peptide site in whole brain corresponds to the f-receptor characterized in
mouse vas deferens.
the regional distributions in brain tissue of
both types of binding sites have not been
clearly established and the localization and
the nature o f the receptor mediating each
known central effect of morphine-like drugs
have thus n o t been characterized in terms of
~- or f-receptors. if we consider the analgesic
effect, the main central action induced by
these drugs, the predictive value of either
biological assays or biochemical studies is far
from clear (kosterlitz et al., 1978; shaw et al.,
1978) and consequently the nature of the
receptor involved in this effect remains unknown. however, if enkephalin analogs are
considered which have the same c-terminal
amino acid as do enkephalins, i.e. methionine
or leucine, there is a good correlation between
their activity or affinity on #-receptors and
their analgesic potency. these data tend to
support the hypothesis that p-receptors are
concerned with the analgesic effect of such
drugs. such a conclusion cannot be drawn for
all analogs, since replacing methionine or
leucine by proline confers special properties,
i.e. stronger activity for an equivalent affinity;
however a correlation can still be established
