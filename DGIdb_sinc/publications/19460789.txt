abstract: acetylcholine is the primary parasympathetic neurotransmitter in the airways and is
known to cause bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. recent findings suggest that
acetylcholine also regulates aspects of remodelling and inflammation through its action on
muscarinic receptors.
in the present study, we aimed to determine the effects of muscarinic receptor stimulation on
cytokine production by human airway smooth muscle cells (primary and immortalised cell lines).
the muscarinic receptor agonists carbachol and  xxxd2586xxx  both induced modest effects on
basal interleukin (il)-8 and -6 secretion, whereas the secretion of  xxxg363xxx ,  xxxg354xxx , vascular
endothelial growth factor-a and  xxxg357xxx  was not affected. secretion
of il-8 and -6 was only observed in immortalised airway smooth muscle cells that express
muscarinic m3 receptors. in these cells,  xxxd2586xxx  also significantly augmented il-8 secretion
in combination with cigarette smoke extract in a synergistic manner, whereas synergistic effects
on il-6 secretion were not significant.
muscarinic m3 receptors were the primary subtype involved in augmenting cigarette smoke
extract-induced il-8 secretion, as only tiotropium bromide and muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  subtype
selective antagonists abrogated the effects of  xxxd2586xxx .
collectively, these results indicate that muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  stimulation augments cigarette
smoke extract-induced cytokine production by airway smooth muscle. this interaction could be of
importance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

he role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter that regulates airway smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion in the
airways is well established, and is mediated
through muscarinic receptors [1]. acetylcholine
is an important regulator of airway smooth
muscle tone, especially in patients that suffer
from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(copd), in whom cholinergic tone appears to
be the primary reversible component of airflow
obstruction. therefore, anticholinergics are commonly used bronchodilators in copd, and less
frequently in asthma [2].

synthesising enzyme choline acetyl transferase
(chat) is also expressed by non-neuronal sources

neutrophil, eosinophil and monocyte chemotactic activities in
response to acetylcholine [7, 8] and suggest that acetylcholine
is a paracrine and/or autocrine mediator that regulates
inflammatory processes.
acetylcholine also triggers chemokine and cytokine release
from structural cells that play a role in copd pathogenesis.
for example, bronchial epithelial cells exhibit neutrophil,
eosinophil and monocyte chemotactic activity in response to
acetylcholine [9, 10]. since the synthesis of non-neuronal
acetylcholine is relatively high in bronchial epithelial cells
[11], these results implicate a role for acetylcholine (autocrine
or paracrine) in initiating inflammatory responses. this
contention is supported by animal studies that demonstrate
protective effects of anticholinergics on inflammation induced
by inhaled allergen [12] or inhaled diesel particles [13]. in
addition, increased expression of chat has been reported in
fibroblasts from active smokers and copd patients [14].
similar observations were reported in vitro in human lung
fibroblasts (hfl-1) treated with cigarette smoke extract [14].
whether acetylcholine regulates inflammatory responses in
copd is, however, largely unknown.
the airway smooth muscle cell is increasingly recognised as an
important cellular source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
growth factors, including interleukins (il)-6 and -8, monocyte
chemoattractant protein (mcp)-1, vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) and others (see [15–17] for review) and it
appears to play an important immunomodulatory role in
airways diseases such as asthma and copd. the immunomodulatory function of airway smooth muscle has mostly been
studied in cell culture; these studies have revealed that gprotein-coupled receptor agonists, growth factors, cytokines
and extracellular matrix proteins can induce the release of
significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines [15–17]. in
addition, airway smooth muscle cells exhibit il-8 release in
response to cigarette smoke extract, which is strongly
augmented by cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx 
(tnf)-a [18]. the regulatory role of acetylcholine in these
synthetic airway smooth muscle cell responses is largely
unknown. a study using bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips
showed that stimulation with carbachol resulted in increased
expression of il-8, cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and -2 at the
mrna level [19]. this study [19], together with the fact that
airway smooth muscle expresses muscarinic m2 and m3
receptors in abundance, suggests a role for these receptors in
release of mediators. therefore airway smooth muscle may
represent a primary target of acetylcholine released by nerve
and other cell types in the airways.

cell and animal studies

(htert), were used for the experiments. the primary cultured
human bronchial smooth muscle cells used to generate each
cell line were prepared as previously described [20] from
macroscopically healthy segments of second-to-fourth generation main bronchus obtained after lung resection surgery from
patients with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. all procedures
were approved by the human research ethics board of the
university of manitoba. as we have detailed previously [20],
each cell line was thoroughly characterised to passage 10 and
higher, and was shown to express a number of smooth muscle
(sm) contractile phenotype marker proteins (e.g. sm-myosin
heavy chain, sm-a-actin and desmin). for all experiments,
passage 10–25 myocytes grown on uncoated plastic dishes in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented
with 50 u? xxxg1167xxx  streptomycin, 50 mg? xxxg1167xxx  penicillin and 10%
v/v fetal bovine serum (fbs) were used.
in selected experiments, primary human airway smooth
muscle cells from two different commercial sources
(stratagene, la jolla, and clonetics, san diego, ca, usa)
were used. these cells were cultured in dmem/f12 nutrient
mixture supplemented with 25 mm hepes, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 1% v/v non-essential amino acids, 10% v/v fbs (all
from invitrogen, breda, the netherlands) and antibiotics. cells
at passages 5–7 were used to perform experiments.
treatments
unless otherwise specified, cells were grown to confluence and
serum-starved for 1 day in dmem supplemented with antibiotics (50 u? xxxg1167xxx  streptomycin, 50 mg? xxxg1167xxx  penicillin,
1.5 mg? xxxg1167xxx   xxxd164xxx ) and its (5 mg? xxxg1167xxx  insulin,
5 mg? xxxg1167xxx  transferrin and 5 ng? xxxg1167xxx  selenium) before each
experiment. cells were then subjected to different treatments
for 24 h in dmem supplemented with antibiotics. muscarinic
receptor antagonists ( xxxd2174xxx , 4-damp, dau5884 and
tiotropium) were added 30 min prior to the addition of
agonists. cigarette smoke extract was prepared by combusting
two kentucky 2r4f research cigarettes (filters removed;
lexington, ky, usa) using a peristaltic pump (watson
marlow 323 e/d, wilmington, ma, usa) and passing the
smoke through 25 ml of fbs-free dmem supplemented with
antibiotics at a rate of 5 min?cigarette-1. the obtained solution
was referred to as 100% strength.

based on the above-mentioned observations, in the present
study, we aimed to characterise the pro-inflammatory
response of human airway smooth muscle cells induced by
muscarinic receptor stimulation, and to investigate potential
functional interactions with cigarette smoke extract. in addition, we aimed to investigate the role of muscarinic m2 and m3
receptor subtype(s) involved in these responses.

results
muscarinic receptors induce il-8 and il-6 secretion from
airway smooth muscle cell lines that express muscarinic
m3 receptors
to evaluate the role of muscarinic receptors in the synthetic
function of airway smooth muscle cells, we analysed supernatants of airway smooth muscle cells treated with carbachol for
an array of secreted proteins using a multiplex cytokine assay.
we used a mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( xxxg2296xxx , il-1b
and ifn-c) as a positive control for induction of cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors and to normalise for heterogeneity in responses between cell lines. using cells from one of
the immortalised cell lines, we found that carbachol alone
induced a modest increase in il-8 and il-6 release, compared
with that induced by cytokine mixture, which induced release of
several cytokines (e.g. il-6), chemokines (including  xxxg363xxx ,
 xxxg354xxx ,  xxxg357xxx ) and growth factors (e.g.  xxxg2413xxx ) (fig. 1). a full
list of mediators induced by the mixture of cytokines is listed in
the online supplementary material (table e2). little effect of
carbachol exposure was seen in the primary airway smooth
muscle cells from the commercial sources, whereas the cytokine
1438

volume 34 number 6

mixture induced the same pattern of cytokine release that was
observed for the immortalised airway smooth muscle cells (data
not shown).
we verified our findings on il-6 and -8 release using a
sandwich elisa. carbachol (0.01–100 mm) dose-dependently
increased il-6 and -8 release in the immortalised cell line, with
a greater increase in il-6 compared with il-8 (fig. 2a; donor 1).
as in the bio-plex assay, carbachol did not affect release of
these factors in primary cultured cells (fig. 2b and c; donors 2
and 3). as it has been shown that passage of primary cells in
culture reduces the expression of muscarinic m3 receptors, we
assessed the mrna expression of muscarinic receptors (m1,
m2 and m3 receptors). the immortalised cells expressed both
m2 and  xxxg449xxx  mrna in high amounts, whereas the
primary cells from the commercial sources only expressed
mrna for m2 receptors (fig. 2). this difference between cell
cultures suggested that m3 receptors could be involved in the
carbachol-induced il-8 and -6 release. none of the airway
smooth muscle cells we tested expressed the muscarinic m1
receptor.
muscarinic receptor stimulation augments il-8 secretion
induced by cigarette smoke extract
we next evaluated the effects of muscarinic receptor stimulation on cytokine secretion in combination with cigarette smoke
extract. cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for copd,
and an aqueous extract of cigarette smoke induces the
expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines by cells that
play an immunomodulatory role in copd, including airway
smooth muscle cells [15, 21]. in view of our results examining
the effects of muscarinic receptor ligation alone, and the
differential expression pattern of muscarinic receptors between
cell lines, we focused our next studies on the secretion of il-6
and -8 using only the immortalised cell lines (which retain

carbachol induces an increase in interleukin (il)-6 and -8 release in cells expressing the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  (m3r) only. human airway smooth muscle

subsequently treated in triplicate with increasing concentrations of carbachol as indicated. in addition, rna of untreated cells was harvested. supernatants were analysed for

muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  expression, see fig. 2). moreover, our
studies using these cells confirmed the functional expression of
muscarinic m3 receptors, as ascertained by the mobilisation of
intracellular ca2+ in response to the muscarinic receptor
agonists  xxxd2586xxx  and acetylcholine, and by ligandbinding assays [22].

cigarette smoke extract induced a profound induction of il-8
secretion that was concentration-dependent and maximal at the
highest concentration tested (15%) (fig. 3). the effects of higher
concentrations were not evaluated as these induced significant
cell death. interestingly, cigarette smoke extract alone did not
induce the secretion of il-6, whereas  xxxd2586xxx  alone did

induce il-6 (fig. 3), suggesting that its pro-inflammatory effects
are quite specific. in addition to its ability to significantly
increase il-6 secretion, only a modest effect of  xxxd2586xxx  was
observed for il-8 secretion in some experiments. the most
profound induction of il-8 secretion we observed occurred
when cigarette smoke extract and  xxxd2586xxx  were combined.
for instance, although  xxxd2586xxx  alone did not induce
significant il-8 secretion, it profoundly augmented the response
induced by cigarette smoke extract, particularly at lower
concentrations of cigarette smoke extract (fig. 3). no synergistic
effects of  xxxd2586xxx  and cigarette smoke extract on il-6
secretion were observed. further analysis of the interaction
between  xxxd2586xxx  and cigarette smoke extract indicated
that the effects of  xxxd2586xxx  were concentration dependent,
with the most pronounced synergy observed at the highest
concentration  xxxd2586xxx  tested (10 mm; fig. 4). since the
synergistic effect on il-8 secretion was highest for 10 mm
 xxxd2586xxx  and 5% cigarette smoke extract, we used these

conditions in further experiments to assess the muscarinic
receptors involved.
muscarinic m3 receptors augment il-8 secretion induced
by cigarette smoke extract
since our initial experiments suggested that the effects of
muscarinic receptor stimulation on cytokine secretion were
observed only in cells that express muscarinic m3 receptors,
we next characterised the role of muscarinic receptor subtypes
further. to this aim, we selected subtype selective muscarinic
receptor antagonists dau5884, 4-damp (m3 selective) and
 xxxd2174xxx  (m2 selective). the inhibitory effect of the clinically
used muscarinic receptor antagonist tiotropium was also
evaluated. m3-selective dau5884 and 4-damp were applied
in concentrations that occupy the majority (.99%) of the
muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  population with relatively modest
(,30%) occupation of the muscarinic m2 subtype, whereas the
concentration of the m2 selective  xxxd2174xxx  was chosen to
ensure no significant effects on m3 receptors [23–26].
interestingly, both tiotropium and the m3-selective 4-damp
and dau5884 completely inhibited the synergistic effect of
 xxxd2586xxx  on cigarette smoke extract-induced il-8 secretion, whereas the m2-selective  xxxd2174xxx  had no significant
effect (fig. 5). responses induced by cigarette smoke extract
alone were not affected by the treatment with the antagonists.
these results confirm that the primary receptor subtype
involved in the synergism between  xxxd2586xxx  and cigarette
smoke extract is the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx .
discussion
the results from our study indicate that muscarinic receptor
stimulation induces a pro-inflammatory response of airway
smooth muscle cells, and that the response induced by

cigarette smoke extract is strongly enhanced. these results
extend previous observations by others who have shown that
muscarinic receptor stimulation can induce il-8 production by
bronchial epithelial cells, and leukotriene b4 production by
monocytes, macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells [6, 8–10,
27]. muscarinic receptor stimulation using carbachol was also
previously shown to regulate pro-inflammatory gene transcription of il-6 and -8 and cox-2 induced by mechanical
stimulation of airway smooth muscle strips [19]. our current
findings confirm these studies and provide novel insights as
we demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction with the
response induced by cigarette smoke extract. collectively,
these findings indicate that muscarinic receptors are coupled to
pro-inflammatory gene expression in several cell types
involved in copd pathogenesis.

the  xxxg449xxx  subtype is the primary receptor subtype
involved in airway smooth muscle contraction and in cell
proliferation induced by  xxxd2586xxx  [23–25, 28]. based on
these findings,  xxxg449xxx  subtype selectivity would appear
to be an advantageous property of muscarinic receptor
antagonists, especially since inhibition of m2 autoreceptors
on vagal nerve terminals is associated with enhanced
acetylcholine release [3, 29]. indeed, the ‘‘kinetic’’ muscarinic
m3 selective properties of tiotropium have been viewed as
beneficial and new muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  selective antagonists are currently under development [30–34]. nonetheless,
recent reports indicate that proliferative and pro-fibrotic
responses of lung fibroblasts are mediated via muscarinic m2
receptors and pertussis toxin sensitive gi/o proteins [35, 36].
therefore it is clear that to clarify the benefits and negative
aspects of muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity requires
future study.
our study was performed using both primary airway smooth
muscle cells and several immortalised airway smooth muscle
cell lines. the immortalised smooth muscle cells retained
expression of the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  and the capacity to
regulate il-8 secretion in concert with cigarette smoke,
whereas the primary cells lost  xxxg449xxx  expression in
culture as well as their capacity to produce il-8 in response to
muscarinic receptor activation. the immortalised cells also
retain the capacity to respond to contractile agonists (calcium
signalling), the capacity for induction of contractile proteins,
and the capacity to proliferate upon stimulation with growth
factors [20, 37]. these aspects make the immortalised cell lines
a well-suited model with which to study the role of muscarinic
m3 receptors in physiological responses of airway smooth
muscle cells in vitro. however, translation of our results to
intact organ systems, in vivo models and clinical studies is
necessary to confirm the functional interaction of acetylcholine
with cigarette smoke in patients.

the results from our study indicate that  xxxd2586xxx  synergy
with cigarette smoke extract is primarily dependent on the
muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  subtype. application of dau5884 or 4damp in concentrations that are m3 selective almost
completely inhibited the synergy between  xxxd2586xxx  and
cigarette smoke extract, whereas the antagonist  xxxd2174xxx ,
applied in concentrations that are m2 selective had no
significant effect. it is clear therefore that the primary receptor
subtype involved in synergy is the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx .
this is further confirmed by our studies indicating that airway
smooth muscle cells that lost expression of functional m3
receptors in culture lack functional il-6 and -8 responses to
carbachol. the m3-dependent nature of this effect is in line
with findings reported for il-8 production in epithelial cells
[27], and complements our previous findings that indicate that

activation of the non-neuronal cholinergic system [38] in
airway smooth muscle is unlikely to be of major functional
importance to cigarette smoke-induced pro-inflammatory
cytokine production, as we did not observe any effects of
tiotropium or other muscarinic receptor antagonists on cells
exposed to cigarette smoke extract alone. nonetheless, in intact
lungs, stimulation of muscarinic receptors, for example, by
neuronal or inflammatory cell-derived acetylcholine, could
augment the inflammatory response induced by smoking,
suggesting that cigarette smoke extract could promote an
immunomodulatory role for muscarinic receptors on airway
smooth muscle cells, thereby potentiating its pro-inflammatory
effects. although increased airway smooth muscle mass is
found in patients with copd [39], the role of airway smooth
muscle cells in the inflammatory process observed in copd
has not yet been extensively studied. airway smooth muscle
bundles in copd patients are infiltrated by neutrophils and
cd8+ t-cells [40, 41], suggesting that airway smooth muscle
cells may actively recruit these cells. also, in vitro studies have
shown that airway smooth muscle cells produce il-8 in
response to many inflammatory mediators implicated in
copd, including  xxxg2296xxx  [42],  xxxg1166xxx  [43] and neutrophil
products, such as  xxxd1773xxx  [44], bacteria [45] and cigarette smoke
[18]. combining cigarette smoke with  xxxg2296xxx  results in a
synergistic increase in il-8 release [46]. our data also show

that muscarinic receptor agonists can act in concert with
cigarette smoke to induce the production of il-8 by airway
smooth muscle cells, suggesting that these cells, in addition to
epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, could play an important
role in the inflammatory process involved in neutrophil
recruitment and exacerbations of copd. in addition, our
findings may have implications for our understanding of
muscarinic receptor function on airway smooth muscle cells in
smoking asthmatics.
clinical studies have demonstrated that anticholinergic agents,
in particular the long-acting anticholinergic drug tiotropium
bromide, have beneficial therapeutic effects in copd patients
that exceed their acute bronchodilatory effects. several clinical
studies suggest that tiotropium bromide may have beneficial
effects on inflammation and/or remodelling in copd, which
is supported by several animal and cell culture studies that
report effects of muscarinic receptors on cytokine production,
cell proliferation, matrix protein production and airway
remodelling (see references [3–5] for review). however, prior
to our present study, reports that have directly investigated the
interaction of muscarinic receptors with cigarette smokeinduced responses had been lacking. our results provide
important new insights in this area; however, studies that
investigate the effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists in
animal models of copd are clearly needed.
in conclusion, the results from our study indicate that
activation of muscarinic m3 receptors expressed by airway
smooth muscle induces il-6 and -8 production and augments
the pro-inflammatory cytokine response induced by cigarette
smoke extract. these results imply a role for the airway
cholinergic system in modulating cigarette smoke-induced
inflammation that is of clear interest to copd pathogenesis
and treatment. future studies are needed to investigate the role
of this mechanism in copd and to clarify the mechanisms
involved.
