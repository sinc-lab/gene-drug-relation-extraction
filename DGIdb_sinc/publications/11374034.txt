identified as unique products of  xxxd3522xxx  action. the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent step is a carboxylation reaction
that selectively takes place at a number of well-defined
glutamate residues in only a small number of proteins (1,
4).  xxxd3522xxx  is transported in its most stable form, i.e.,

as a quinone, but before being active as a coenzyme  xxxd3522xxx  quinone must be reduced into its hydroquinone
form (kh2). oxidation of kh2 provides the energy for the
abstraction of a protein from the g-carbon in the glutamate residue to generate a carbanion that undergoes carboxylation resulting in a gla-residue and  xxxd3522xxx  2,3epoxide (ko). the latter can be re-converted into k and
kh2 by the action of an enzyme called ko-reductase, and
in this way  xxxd3522xxx  is recycled several thousandfold
before it is metabolized into more polar, inactive products. this explains why the requirement of  xxxd3522xxx  is
much lower than that of most other vitamins.
the common part of the structure of all k-vitamins is
 xxxd2563xxx , also known as  xxxd2563xxx . natural k-vitamers are  xxxd2563xxx -derivatives
differing from each other in a polyisorprenoid side chain
attached to the 3-position of the ring structure.  xxxd2941xxx , also known as  xxxd2941xxx , is produced by green
plants, where it is tightly associated with the thylakoid
membranes of the chloroplasts. it is a single compound
containing four isoprenoid residues (one of which is
unsaturated) in its aliphatic side chain. menaquinones,
also known by their group name vitamin k2, contain side
chains of varying length; they are designated as mk-n
where n stands for the number of isoprenoid residues, all
of which are unsaturated. long chain menaquinones

(mk-7 through mk-10) are exclusively synthesized by
bacteria, but some mammalian tissues (notably testis,
pancreas, and arterial vessel wall) possess the remarkable
ability to convert  xxxd2941xxx  into mk-4 (5). the fact
that even at very high  xxxd2941xxx  intake the accumulated  xxxd3522xxx  in these tissues is almost exclusively in
the form of mk-4 suggests that menaquinones are more
important for these tissues than is  xxxd2941xxx  (6).
also the bacterial flora in the intestinal tract produces
large amounts of menaquinones but, since at the site of
synthesis (the colon) absorption seems to be unlikely, the
question of whether and to which extent the intestinal
flora contricutes to the human  xxxd3522xxx  status is still
unclear (7, 8). from these data it appears that both  xxxd2941xxx  and menaquinones are present in the circulation and that the ratio in which these k-vitamers are
taken up is tissue dependent. we have therefore,
addressed the question of whether experimental animals
(rats) exhibit a tissue-specific use of either  xxxd2941xxx  or menaquinones. in these experiments, in which
we have used mk-4 as a representative of the group of
menaquinones, reduction of ko was blocked by warfarin
so that the contribution of each k-vitamer to gla-formation could be assessed from the k/ko ratio. this technique was previously reported for liver by reedstrom
and suttie (9). in a group of five rats, k/ko ratios (mean

± sem) for hepatic  xxxd2941xxx  (0.25 ± 0.05) were
much lower than for mk-4 (1.91 ± 0.59), suggesting a
preferential use of  xxxd2941xxx  by the liver. in arterial
vessel wall, on the other hand, substantial mk-4 epoxide
formation was observed with tenfold lower k/ko ratios
for mk-4 (0.39 ± 0.16) than for  xxxd2941xxx  (3.78 ±
1.15). these data point in the direction of a tissue specific
utilization of k1 and k2.

functions of gla-proteins
gammaglutamate carboxylase has been found in a wide
variety of mammalian tissues, but it seems that – besides
those mentioned below – the corresponding gla-proteins
are produced in relatively low quantities. incompletely
characterized gla-proteins have been reported to occur
in spermatozoa, urine, and extracts of calcified atherosclerotic plaques (1, 10). those characterized to the level
of aminoacid sequence have regulatory functions in one
of three important physiological processes: blood coagulation (11), bone metabolism (12, 13), and vascular biology (14). here we will restrict ourselves to the latter
group. in the arterial vessel wall the functions of gla-proteins are probably associated with: local inhibition of
thrombosis [ xxxg1850xxx  (15)], inhibition of mineralization
[mgp (16)], and stimulation of normal cell growth and
prevention of apoptosis in growth arrested cells [ xxxg864xxx 
(17, 18)]. circulating  xxxg1850xxx  is known to inhibit blood
coagulation and thrombus formation by acting as a
cofactor for  xxxg1847xxx ; there are no arguments
indicating that the function of vascular  xxxg1850xxx  is different. the function of growth arrest specific gene 6 protein ( xxxg864xxx ) has so far only been investigated in cell culture systems, in which it was shown that  xxxg864xxx  prevents
starvation-induced death of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and may also act as a growth-potentiating factor
which acts synergistically with other known growth factors in these cells. these data suggest that in humans
 xxxg864xxx  plays a role in preventing the degeneration of the
atherosclerotic vessel wall. gla-residues were shown to
be essential for  xxxg864xxx  functions in cell culture (17).
mgp is a 10-kd secretory protein containing 5 glaresidues. it was discovered as a component in demineralized bone extracts (19) but it is now known that it is also
expressed in a wide variety of soft tissues such as cartilage, heart, lung, kidney, and arterial vessel wall (16, 20,
21). cultured cells in which mgp synthesis has been
detected include osteoblasts, chondrocytes, vascular
smooth muscle cells, pneumocytes, kidney cells, and
fibroblasts (21–23). although several soft tissues express
more mgp mrna than does bone, significant levels of
the protein itself have only been found in bone and cartilage (19, 20). massive cartilage and vascular calcification in transgenic mgp-deficient mice demonstrated that
mgp is a strong inhibitor of soft tissue calcification (24).

iii/59

excessive aorta mineralization was also observed in rats
after 4–6 weeks of treatment with  xxxd3522xxx -antagonists,
showing that the gla-residues are essential for the function of mgp (25).

pathophysiology of  xxxd3522xxx -deficiency
and oral anticoagulants
the discovery that gla-proteins are synthesized in widely
varying amounts of various tissues has led to the concept
of tissue-specific  xxxd3522xxx -requirement. only in
extreme cases low dietary  xxxd3522xxx  intake leads to the
hepatic synthesis of undercarboxylated clotting factors
(26). apparently, the liver is capable of extracting  xxxd3522xxx  from the circulation in a highly efficient way. since
accumulating evidence suggests that the present rda
value (1 µg/day per kg body weight) it too low to allow
adequate carboxylation of all extrahepatic gla-proteins,
it is at least questionable, therefore, that recommended
dietary allowances for  xxxd3522xxx  are exclusively based on
blood coagulation data (i.e., the hepatic synthesis of
blood clotting factors). moreover, this value is exclusively based on  xxxd2941xxx  intake. it has been shown,
however, that extrahepatic tissues preferentially accumulate and use menaquinones; hence it is not very meaningful to apply rda values defined on the basis of hepatic
 xxxd2941xxx  requirement.
in the light of the arguments summarized above it is
not surprising that in a large majority of the investigated
healthy human adults extrahepatic gla-proteins such as
osteocalcin and mgp were found in a partly carboxylated
form (19, 27). the question whether the occurrence of
undercarboxylated osteocalcin and mgp are associated
with certain diseases has not been answered unequivocally at this time. low serum levels of  xxxd3522xxx  were
found in subjects with postmenopausal osteoporosis and
femur neck fractures (28, 29), and in a population-based
study low dietary  xxxd2941xxx  intake was found to be associated with low bone mass (30). moreover, independent
studies have demonstrated that circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin is inversely correlated with bone
mass (31) and directly correlated with fracture risk (32,
33), whereas increased intake of  xxxd3522xxx  resulted in
improved osteocalcin carboxylation (34, 35). a number
of japanese studies have also shown a significantly higher
bone mass and decreased fracture risk after long-term
supplementation with vitamin k2, but these studies
require confirmation in other populations and geographic areas (36, 37).
oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are vitamin
k-antagonists and have more pronounced effects than
 xxxd3522xxx  deficiency, notably at young age. this was
discovered in women who were anticoagulated during
the first trimester of pregnancy and who gave birth to
babies with serious bone defects in 30 % of the cases [the

iii/60

‘fetal warfarin syndrome’ (38)]. similar bone defects
could be provoked by subjecting young animals to a
regimen of  xxxd3522xxx + warfarin (39). only after the discovery of the major importance of mgp for the prevention of arterial calcification (24), were the effects of warfarin treatment on the vessel wall also investigated (25).
it appeared that the rat arterial vessel wall, notably the
tunica media, already contained substantial calcifications after 2–3 weeks of warfarin treatment. at later arge,
both in experimental animals and in humans, the effects
of oral anticoagulant treatment seem to be less severe,
but it should be emphasized that in many cases this therapy is continued for several years, sometimes lifelong.
accumulating literature data demonstrate that in adults

the long-term use of oral anticoagulants is associated
with decreased bone mass. no data have been published
about effects of warfarin on the human vascular system,
but it may be expected that oral anticoagulant treatment
forms a risk factor for arterial calcification, notably for
calcium deposition around the elastin fibers of the tunica
media.

development of a monoclonal antibody against mgp
recently, we have reported the production of a monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide homologous to the amino acid sequence 3 – 15 in human mgp

l. j. schurgers et al.
role of  xxxd3522xxx  and  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins in vascular calcification

(40). selection of the clones was performed by specific
recognition of recombinant mgp which had been
expressed in e. coli as a chimeric protein linked to
murine  xxxg631xxx . on western blots prepared after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under
reducing conditions, the antibody specifically recognized
full length synthetic mgp (84 amino acid residues), as
well as a single protein band in a homogenate prepared
from human cartilage (kind gift from dr. r. wallin). the
apparent molecular weights of synthetic and native mgp
were 10 kd. the antibody will be designated as mab3–15
and is used in a number of studies described below.

association of arterial mgp with vascular sclerosis
mgp was visualized by immunohistochemical techniques in healthy and atherosclerotic coronary arteries.
figure 2a shows the typical low but distinct constitutive
mgp expression as is generally seen in the smooth muscle cells of healthy and early atherosclerotic arteries.
accumulation of mgp was found at sites of intima sclerosis starting at type ii but was increasingly present at
types iii and iv (aha classification, fig. 2b). the highest concentrations of mgp were found at the interface of
tissue and precipitated calcium salts in type vb atherosclerotic lesions (fig. 2c and d). although other explanations are possible, these data suggest that as a response
to intima sclerosis de novo mgp synthesis is induced,
possibly as a defense mechanism against the intrusion of
calcium salt crystals. in another series of experiments we
have analyzed coronary arteries from patients with
severe diabetes. as is shown in fig. 2e, calcium precipitates were mainly found in the tunica media and, also in
this case, mgp was mainly associated with the sites of calcification (fig. 2f). this is noteworthy because the etiology of media calcification might be different from that of

matched controls (mean w se; 99.3 w

calcium deposition in the intima and in the atherosclerotic plaque. plaque formation is generally thought to be
the result of an inflammatory process, associated with
apoptosis, accretion of lipids, and macrophage infiltration. media sclerosis, also known as mönckeberg sclerosis, is not necessarily associated with atherosclerosis and
is most often seen in patients with diabetes mellitus and
uraemia. the fact that both types of sclerosis strongly
induce mgp expression suggests that the contact
between tissue and calcium salt crystal is a common trigger in this process. when analyzing early phases of calcification in peripheral arteries of diabetics, it became
apparent that the elastic lamellae were the first sites of
calcium deposition (fig. 2g). moreover, in these experiments mgp expression seemed to be inversely correlated
to calcification (fig. 2h). this further supports the idea
that tissue calcification is retarded by mgp.

association of circulating mgp with vascular disease
and diabetes mellitus
recently, we have published a first generation assay for
mgp in human serum and plasma (40). this assay is
based on the specific recognition in serum of mgp by
mab3–15, followed by titration of the remaining antibodies with microtiter plate-bound recombinant mgp. the
assay does not discriminate between intact and degraded
mgp, nor does it discriminate between carboxylated or
undercarboxylated forms of mgp. we have used this
assay to compare several patient groups with age- and
sex-matched apparently healthy subjects (see fig. 3).
serum mgp concentrations determined with this assay
were increased in subjects with advanced atherosclerosis
and in diabetics (fig. 3), but not in those with osteoporosis or other bone diseases (data not shown). these
results are consistent with the immunohistochemical

data and suggest that circulating mgp antigen may be
used as a marker for vascular disease. however, since this
assay has only recently become available, further insights
into its clinical utility will require a more critical validation as well as further knowledge of the role of mgp in
vascular biology.

discussion
data presented in this paper demonstrate that vascular
degeneration is associated with increased expression of
mgp, starting well before visible calcification, but most
prominently present at the boundaries between precipitated calcium salts and adjacent tissue. since the generally accepted function of mgp is the prevention of calcification, our data lead to an apparent contradiction: in
calcifying tissue there is a strong increase of mgp expression, but calcification is not prevented. these observations can be explained as follows. first, most body fluids
are supersaturated with calcium and phosphate, and precipitation of calcium salts is actively prevented by a complex mechanism of crystallization inhibition (14). mgp
forms part of this mechanism, but apparently pathological conditions leading to calcium deposition may be
stronger than the calcification inhibitory activity of mgp
is, even at increased mgp expression. this assumption is
supported by the fact that at sites of most intense mgp
staining calcification seemed to be less prononced (cf.
fig. 2c and d, and 2g and h). second, we wish to put forward the hypothesis that in a substantial part of the adult
population the arterial  xxxd3522xxx  supply is marginal so
that at increased mgp synthesis (as a response to tissue
calcification) the  xxxd3522xxx  status of the arterial vessel
wall is inadequate to support full mgp carboxylation.
this means that mainly undercarboxylated, non-functional mgp is produced which is incapable of retarding
the calcification process. unfortunately, this hypothesis
cannot be confirmed before conformation-specific antibodies become available allowing the separate visualization of carboxylated and undercarboxylated mgp.
the hypothesis of vascular  xxxd3522xxx -deficiency in
subjects with normal hemostasis implies the concept
of tissue-defined  xxxd3522xxx  requirement: whereas the
hepatic  xxxd3522xxx  supply is sufficient to support full carboxylation of the blood coagulation factors, other tissues

may produce gla-proteins in an undercarboxylated
form. several independent studies have demonstrated
that undercarboxylation of the bone gla-protein osteocalcin is common in healthy adults, and it has been suggested that undercarboxylated osteocalcin is a sensitive
marker for the  xxxd3522xxx  status of extrahepatic tissues
including the vessel wall (41). it is not hard to envision
that in cases in which the vascular  xxxd3522xxx  status is
insufficient to support normal mgp carboxylation,
upregulation of mgp expression will only result in more
undercarboxylated (non-functional) mgp. hence the
remaining questions are: how much  xxxd3522xxx  is
required for an optimal vascular function, and is there a
specific role for menaquinones? human nutrition data
have demonstrated that k2 vitamins are preferentially
found in the ldl fraction of serum lipoproteins (l. j.
schurgers et al., unpublished data). this suggests a specific transport to and uptake of menaquinones by extrahepatic tissues. specific uptake of mk-4 rather than k1
was also found in experimental animals, with k1/mk-4
ratios differing 2–3 orders of magnitude for liver and
aorta (6). finally, our data on menaquinone content of
common foods were recently added to the rotterdam
study data base and showed a strong and increasing protection against cardiovascular disease from the lowest to
the highest quartile of menaquinone (and not  xxxd2941xxx ) intake. (j. m. geleijnse et al., unpublished data).
taken together these data strongly suggest that for the
vessel wall menaquinones are more important than is
 xxxd2941xxx .
since no rda value for dietary menaquinone intake
has been defined in any country in the world, a starting
point for recommendations could be the rotterdam
study. mean values of quartiles for vitamin k2 (call
menaquinones) intake were: 10, 23, 33, and 45 µg/day
(42). therefore, we recommend that menaquinone
intake should be increased to 45 µg/day, which is comparable to the amount present in 60 g of cheese or curd
cheese or 4 g of natto. if a similar definition would be
applied for  xxxd2941xxx , the rda value would increase
from 60 to 375 µg/day, which is comparable to 100–200 g
of green vegetables per day. in fact, it is remarkable that
only 25 % of the dutch population meet this recommendation at this time.
