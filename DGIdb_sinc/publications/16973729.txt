hyperphagia alters expression of hypothalamic 5-ht2c
and  xxxg1109xxx  genes and plasma des-acyl

the central melanocortin (mc) pathway is suggested to mediate satiety signaling downstream of serotonin (5-ht)2c receptors.  xxxg1115xxx  mutant mice consume more food,
which leads to late-onset obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. ay mice with ectopic expression of the agouti peptide,
which leads to a perturbation of the central mc pathway,
develop obesity and diabetes, associated with low levels of
plasma total ghrelin. here, we report that 5-wk-old ay mice
consumed more food in association with decreases in levels of
plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not active ghrelin, and increases
in hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression compared with wild-type mice matched for age and body
weight. these alterations were also observed in 8-wk-old
obese ay mice. restricted feeding significantly decreased hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression in

diabetes mellitus, both of which are increasing at alarming rates in industrialized countries, including japan and the
united states. management of eating behavior is an important
therapeutic strategy for obesity and type 2 diabetes.
brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht), systems contribute to regulate eating behavior and energy homeostasis (1–4).
5-ht2c receptors and/or 5-ht1b receptors contribute to mediate
the appetite-suppressing effects of 5-ht drugs, such as m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp) and d- xxxd2095xxx  (2, 5–7). 5-ht2c
receptor mutant mice display leptin-independent hyperphagia
that leads to late-onset obesity and impaired glucose tolerance (3).
the central melanocortin (mc) pathway is suggested to
mediate satiety signaling downstream of 5-ht2c receptors
(8). ay mice have dominant alleles at the agouti locus (a),
which produces ectopic expression of the agouti peptide, an
antagonist of the hypothalamic mc4 receptors and mc3
receptors (9 –11), and display hyperphagia and obesity. ay
mice are reportedly resistant to the anorexic effects induced
by leptin and  xxxd2095xxx  (8, 12, 13). in addition, obese ay
mice have lower levels of plasma ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide secreted from the stomach, than wild-type mice (14).

association with a reversal of the decreases in plasma des-acyl
ghrelin levels in 5-wk-old ay mice. moreover, restricted feeding reduced body weight, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia in association with increases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin
levels in 8-wk-old obese ay mice. administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine and  xxxd2095xxx , both of which induce anorexic effects via 5-ht2c receptors and/or 5-ht1b receptors,
suppressed food intake in 5- and 8-wk-old ay mice, whereas the
anorexic effects were attenuated in food-restricted ay mice.
these findings suggest that the agouti peptide down-regulates hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression under restricted feeding conditions, whereas chronic hyperphagia increases the expression of these genes and
decreases plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in ay mice. (endocrinology 147: 5893–5900, 2006)

ghrelin stimulates gh secretion and food intake (15). fasting
increases plasma ghrelin levels, whereas feeding reduces
plasma ghrelin levels in normal animals and humans (15).
plasma ghrelin levels are also higher in patients with anorexia
nervosa and lower in obese subjects than in normal individuals
(15). it is therefore reasonable that plasma total ghrelin levels are
lower in obese ay mice (14). ghrelin has two forms, however:
active n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin and nonactive des-acyl ghrelin. plasma active and des-acyl ghrelin levels during the development of obesity in ay mice have not been evaluated.
to determine the effects of the agouti peptide on plasma
active and des-acyl ghrelin levels and 5-ht signaling of satiety,
we examined plasma levels of active ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin and hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene
expression in food-unrestricted and food-restricted ay mice
and wild-type mice matched for age. in addition, to determine
the role of hyperphagia in obesity and diabetes in ay mice, we
examined the effects of restricted feeding on obesity and diabetes in ay mice. moreover, to determine whether ay mice are
sensitive to 5-ht2c and/or  xxxg1109xxx  stimulation-induced feeding suppression, we examined the effects of mcpp,
a  xxxg1115xxx  agonist, and  xxxd2095xxx , a 5-ht reuptake
inhibitor and releaser that induces anorexic effects via 5-ht2c
receptors and/or 5-ht1b receptors, on food intake in ay mice.

temperature-controlled (20 –22 c) environment.
in the first experiment, age- and body-weight-matched male 5-wk-old
wild-type mice (25.9 ⫾ 0.4 g) and ay mice (25.8 ⫾ 0.4 g),and age-matched
8-wk-old wild-type mice (31.5 ⫾ 0.5 g) and ay mice (37.9 ⫾ 0.9 g) were
used. daily food intake of the mice was measured. animals were decapitated and blood was collected between 1000 and 1100 h. the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and medulla oblongata were removed to
determine mrna levels, and plasma active ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin
levels were measured. plasma was immediately frozen and stored at
⫺80 c until assayed for active and des-acyl ghrelin. plasma des-acyl
ghrelin levels were also measured after a 24-h fast in 5-wk-old wild-type
mice (23.3 ⫾ 0.3 g) and in 5-wk-old ay mice (22.4 ⫾ 0.3 g).
in the second experiment, plasma active ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin
levels and hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression
were measured in 5-wk-old ay mice (19.7 ⫾ 0.2 g) and wild-type mice
(19.8 ⫾ 0.4 g), which were provided 3.5 g chow pellets daily for 5 d before
the experiment. animals were decapitated, and blood was collected
between 1000 and 1100 h. plasma was immediately frozen and stored at
⫺80 c until assayed for active and des-acyl ghrelin.
in the third experiment, 5-wk-old male ay mice and wild-type littermates, which were provided 3.5 g chow pellets daily for 5 d before
the experiment, were ip injected with saline or mcpp (5 mg/kg). chow
pellets were provided 30 min later. intake of chow pellets was measured
for the next hour. the experiment was performed between 1000 and
1200 h.
in the fourth experiment, body weight, blood glucose, plasma active
ghrelin, and des-acyl ghrelin levels were measured in 8-wk-old ay mice,
which were provided 3.5 g chow pellets daily for 3 d, and freely fed ay
mice. animals were decapitated, and blood was collected between 1000
and 1100 h. blood glucose was measured using a glucose strip (freestyle,
kissei, japan). plasma was immediately frozen and stored at ⫺80 c until
assayed for insulin and active and des-acyl ghrelin.
in the fifth experiment, 5-wk-old male ay mice and wild-type littermates were ip injected with saline or mcpp (5 mg/kg) or  xxxd2095xxx 
(3 mg/kg) 30 min before the onset of the dark cycle. the intake of chow
pellets was measured for the next hour after the onset of the dark cycle.
finally, 8-wk-old male ay mice and wild-type littermates were ip
injected with saline or mcpp (5 mg/kg) twice daily (at 1000 and 1800 h)
for 3 d. daily food intake and body weight were measured.
the doses of mcpp (5 mg/kg) and  xxxd2095xxx  (3 mg/kg) were
selected based on the evidence that mcpp or  xxxd2095xxx -induced
hypophagia was attenuated by a genetic blockade of 5-ht2c receptors
(2, 5).

results
plasma active and des-acyl ghrelin levels in ay mice

to exclude the effects of differences in body weight, we
evaluated plasma active and des-acyl ghrelin levels in 5-wkold ay mice and wild-type mice matched for age and body
weight. there were no genotypic differences in plasma active
ghrelin levels, whereas plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in ay
mice were lower than those in wild-type mice (fig. 1, a and
b). five-week-old ay mice consumed more food than wildtype mice (fig. 1c). in addition, plasma des-acyl ghrelin
levels in ay mice were lower than those in wild-type mice
after a 24-h fast (fig. 1d).
there were decreased plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in
8-wk-old obese ay mice compared with wild-type mice
(fig. 2b), whereas there were no genotypic differences in
plasma active ghrelin levels between 8-wk-old obese ay
mice and wild-type mice (fig. 2a). eight-week-old ay
mice consumed more food and had significantly higher
body weight compared with age-matched wild-type mice
(fig. 2, c and d).

to determine the relationship between plasma des-acyl
ghrelin levels and the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide genes involved in regulating feeding and energy homeostasis, we examined the gene expression of hypothalamic npy, agrp, orexin (orexigenic peptides), pomc, and
cart (anorexigenic peptides), which are major neuropeptides involved in the regulation of feeding behavior (16).
there were no significant differences in hypothalamic npy
and pomc mrna levels between 5-wk-old ay mice and
wild-type mice matched for body weight, whereas hypothalamic cart, agrp, and orexin mrna levels were significantly decreased (0.66-, 0.73-, and 0.76-fold, respectively)
(table 1). there were no significant differences in the gene
expression of these peptides between 8-wk-old ay mice and
wild-type mice (table 1).

effects of restricted feeding on plasma active and des-acyl
ghrelin levels, hypothalamic 5-ht1b and  xxxg1115xxx 
mrna levels, and the responsiveness to mcpp in 5-wk-old
ay mice

to determine whether the alterations of plasma des-acyl
ghrelin and hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx 
mrna levels result from direct effects of the agouti peptide
or to secondary effects induced by hyperphagia, we examined the effects of restricted feeding (3.5 g/d for 5 d) on
plasma active and des-acyl ghrelin levels, hypothalamic
5-ht1b and  xxxg1115xxx  mrna levels, and the responsiveness to mcpp in 5 wk-old ay mice and wild-type mice.
there were no significant differences in plasma active and
des-acyl ghrelin levels between the food-restricted 5 wk-old
ay mice and wild-type mice (fig. 4, a and b). in addition,
hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  mrna levels
were significantly decreased in food-restricted ay mice compared with wild-type mice (fig. 4c). both ay mice and wildtype mice consumed 3.5 g of food during the light cycle for
5 d and were fasted during the dark cycle. after a 15-h fast,

restricted feeding (3.5 g/d for 3 d) significantly increased

it had no effect on plasma active ghrelin levels (fig. 5a). in
addition, restricted feeding significantly reduced body
weight and normalized hyperglycemia in 8-wk-old ay mice
(fig. 5, c and d). the blood glucose levels in food-restricted
8-wk-old ay mice were significantly lower than those in
nonobese 5-wk-old ay (food-restricted 8-wk-old ay mice,
127 ⫾ 5 mg/dl; nonobese 5-wk-old ay mice, 185 ⫾ 8 mg/dl;

discussion

the present results indicate that plasma des-acyl ghrelin
levels, but not active ghrelin levels, are decreased in nonobese ay mice that consume more food. the low plasma
des-acyl ghrelin levels were observed not only in the fed state
but also in a 24-h fasted state of nonobese ay mice. moreover,

decreases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels were observed in
8-wk-old obese ay mice. thus, decreases in plasma des-acyl
ghrelin, but not active ghrelin levels, preceded the development of obesity in ay mice. in addition, restricted feeding
reversed the decrease in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in
nonobese ay mice and increased plasma des-acyl ghrelin
levels in obese ay mice. these findings suggest that chronic
hyperphagia induced by the agouti peptide, rather than the
direct effects of the agouti peptide, contributed to the decreases in des-acyl ghrelin levels, leading to an increased

ratio of active/des-acyl ghrelin. active ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the gh secretagogue receptor 1a, whereas
des-acyl ghrelin exhibits its bioactivities via a mechanism
independent of the gh secretagogue receptor 1a (15). it is
therefore unlikely that des-acyl ghrelin competes with active
ghrelin for binding sites.
because the acylation of ghrelin is assumed to be essential
for its actions, des-acyl ghrelin, which lacks the fatty acid
modification of ghrelin, is assumed to be devoid of biological
effects (15). des-acyl ghrelin does not stimulate gh release
(15). several recent studies, however, indicate that des-acyl
ghrelin has biological effects on cell proliferation, survival,
and metabolism of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, adipocytes, myocytes, and myelocytes and on food intake (15,
17–24), although the effects of des-acyl ghrelin remain controversial. toshinai et al. (20) reported that central des-acyl
ghrelin increases food intake, whereas peripheral des-acyl
ghrelin has no effects on food intake in rats and c57bl6j and
ddy mice. asakawa et al. (21) and chen et al. (22) reported
that either central or peripheral administration of des-acyl
ghrelin suppresses food intake in ddy mice and rats.
in addition, thompson et al. (23) reported that peripheral
des-acyl ghrelin directly promotes adipogenesis in the bone

marrow of gh-deficient dwarf (dw/dw) rats in vivo, whereas
zhang et al. (24) reported that des-acyl ghrelin inhibits adipogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation in 3t3-l1 cells.
moreover, asakawa et al. (21) reported that transgenic mice
overexpressing des-acyl ghrelin have reduced food intake,
body weight, and fat pad mass weight accompanied by decreased linear growth, whereas ariyasu et al. (25) reported
that similar transgenic mice did not reduce food intake and
body fat mass despite reduced longitudinal growth and body
weight. thus, the results of studies of the effects of des-acyl
ghrelin on feeding and adipogenesis are not consistent. on
the other hand, knockout of the ghrelin gene in mice has no
effect on food intake or body weight changes during growth
(26, 27). because of the low plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in
pre-obese and obese ay mice, it is unlikely that des-acyl
ghrelin promotes food intake and adiposity in ay mice.
in the hypothalamus, ghrelin neurons contact the cell bodies and dendrites of npy/agrp and pomc neurons in the
arcuate nucleus (28) and orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (20, 29). the present study, however, demonstrates that alterations of the expression of hypothalamic
npy, agrp, pomc, cart, and orexin genes were not proportional to the alterations of plasma des-acyl ghrelin and the

ratio of active and des-acyl ghrelin. ay mice have an agouti
peptide-induced disturbance of the ␣-msh ligand for mc-4
receptors that leads to hyperphagia (9, 10). these neuropeptides, therefore, are unlikely to contribute to hyperphagia,
decreases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels, or the ratio of
plasma active/des-acyl ghrelin in ay mice.
we previously reported that fasting increases hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression (30). in
the present study, 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression was increased in nonobese hyperphagic ay mice
and decreased by food restriction. the agouti peptide might
therefore have an inhibitory role in hypothalamic 5-ht2c
and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression under restricted feeding conditions. the increase in hypothalamic 5-ht2c and
 xxxg1109xxx  gene expression might be a compensatory
response to hyperphagia induced by the agouti peptide in ay
mice, because 5-ht2c and 5-ht1b receptors have an inhibitory role in feeding (2–7). the present results also demonstrate that low plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels are not associated with alterations of hypothalamic npy, agrp, orexin,
pomc, and cart gene expression in nonobese ay mice. the
increases in hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene
expression preceded the development of obesity in ay mice,
indicating that the induction of hypothalamic 5-ht2c and
 xxxg1109xxx  gene expression is not a secondary response
to obesity and is independent of hypothalamic npy, agrp,
orexin, pomc, and cart gene expression in ay mice. hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression is
likely to be inversely proportional to alterations of plasma
des-acyl ghrelin in ay mice and is altered by the feeding
conditions.
other investigators previously reported that ay mice are
resistant to the anorexic effects of  xxxd2095xxx  (8). the
present study, however, demonstrates that hyperphagic ay
mice are responsive to mcpp- and  xxxd2095xxx -induced
appetite suppression. mcpp and  xxxd2095xxx  increase hypothalamic pomc gene expression and pomc neuronal
activity in vivo and in vitro (8, 30). 5-ht drugs such as mcpp
and  xxxd2095xxx  interact with pomc neurons in the hypothalamus and might stimulate pomc neurons to release
enough ␣-msh to overcome agouti blockade of mc receptors, because ay mice are sensitive to mc agonist-induced
feeding suppression (10). in addition, mcpp and  xxxd2095xxx  increase hypothalamic cart gene expression (30).
cart neurons have a different downstream pathway from
mc (31, 32). pomc as well as cart might contribute to the
anorexic effects of mcpp and  xxxd2095xxx .
the discrepancy between our results and previous results
by other investigators might be because of the different methods used. heisler et al. (33) examined the effects of  xxxd2095xxx  on food intake for 50 min after ip  xxxd2095xxx  injection. on the other hand, we administered the drugs ip, and
30 min later food was provided, and then we measured food
intake for the next 1 h, because it usually takes about 30 min
for drugs to act systemically after ip injection. the feeding
state of mice might also contribute to the discrepancy. the
present study demonstrates that the anorexic effects induced
by stimulation of 5-ht2c and 5-ht1b receptors were attenuated in food-restricted ay mice, but not in hyperphagic ay
mice. in a pharmacological study, heisler et al. (33) used

4-wk-old ay and wild-type mice, which might not have differed in food intake before the experiment. restricted feeding
for 3 d markedly reduced body weight, whereas treatment
with mcpp slightly reduced body weight in ay mice despite
the suppression of feeding. mcpp-induced decreases in locomotor activity (33, 34) might contribute to this difference,
because decreases in locomotor activity decrease energy
expenditure.
in summary, these results suggest that the agouti peptide
down-regulates hypothalamic 5-ht2c and  xxxg1109xxx 
gene expression under restricted feeding conditions and that
chronic hyperphagia contributes to decreases in plasma desacyl ghrelin levels and increases in hypothalamic 5-ht2c
and  xxxg1109xxx  gene expression in ay mice. hyperphagia predisposes ay mice to obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and
hyperglycemia.
