abstract
the role of adenosine a1 receptors in the activity of drugs and substances protecting against seizures evoked by mitochondrial toxin, 3nitropropionic acid (3-npa) was studied in mice. non-selective a1/a2 adenosine receptor antagonist,  xxxd150xxx  and selective a1
adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx) diminished the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam,
phenobarbital, valproate and gabapentin. in contrast, a1/a2 adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-( p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8pspt) not
penetrating via blood – brain barrier was ineffective.  xxxd150xxx  and dpcpx but not 8pspt also reversed the protective action of a1/a2
adenosine receptor agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (2-cado) and selective a1 adenosine receptor agonist, r-n6-phenylisopropyloadenosine (rpia), against 3-npa-evoked convulsions. obtained results suggest that the central  xxxg81xxx  stimulation may play a role in the
anticonvulsive potential of diazepam, phenobarbital, valproate and gabapentin in a novel model of 3-npa-evoked seizures. moreover,
concomitant application of  xxxd150xxx  with these drugs may reduce their clinical antiepileptic efficacy, especially among patients
suffering from seizures related to the disturbances of mitochondrial respiratory chain.

1. introduction
3-nitropropionic acid (3-npa), a mitochondrial toxin
found in numerous plants and fungi, irreversibly inhibits
the activity of the succinate dehydrogenase which leads to
the disruption of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(ludolph et al., 1991). deranged energy homeostasis may
result in the altered cellular functions, increased susceptibility to glutamate receptors stimulation and finally
cause neuronal death (lees, 1993; urbańska et al.,
1998a; schapira, 1999). chronic peripheral administrations of relatively low doses of 3-npa or its local
intrastriatal application were demonstrated to evoke selective neuronal loss within striatum. these 3-npa-induced
changes show striking similarities to the neuropathological and neurochemical features of huntington’s disease
(beal, 1994; borlongan et al., 1997; alexi et al., 1998).

accumulating data suggest that the impaired energy
metabolism initiates also a cascade of intracellular changes
leading to the initiation and propagation of convulsions
and to the seizure-related neuronal loss (lees, 1993;
urbańska et al., 1998b, 1999). indeed, defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may cause epileptic
seizures, e.g. among patients suffering from myoclonus
epilepsy with ragged red fibers (merrf) or mitochondrial
encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes
(melas) syndromes (torbergsen et al., 1991; wallace
et al., 1994). experimentally applied mitochondrial toxins,
such as  xxxd439xxx  and 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridinium ion (mpp+), evoke convulsions in rodents (turski et al., 1991; turski and stephens,
1992). we have recently shown that 3-npa also acts as a
strong proconvulsant and convulsant, inducing clonic
seizures relatively resistant to antiepileptics. seizures generated by 3-npa can be inhibited by broad-spectrum
antiepileptics, but not by  xxxd2924xxx -like or antiabsence drugs (urbańska et al., 1998b). moreover, convulsive activity of 3-npa seems to be related to the
altered glutamate neurotransmission, since glutamate re-

ceptor antagonists of the non-n-methyl-d-aspartate (nonnmda) type effectively prevent the occurrence of seizures evoked by 3-npa (urbańska et al., 1999; haberek et
al., 2000).
adenosine is a potent neuromodulator exerting depressant actions on neuronal excitability via interaction with
specific membrane receptors of a1 – 3 type (brundege and
dunwiddie, 1997; fredholm, 1997). it may influence the
release of excitatory amino acids and other neurotransmitters or can directly inhibit spontaneous neuronal firing and
synaptic transmission (brundege and dunwiddie, 1997;
fredholm, 1997). agonists of adenosine receptors, especially of a1 type display anticonvulsive effects in various
models of seizures, e.g. induced electrically or chemically
(murray et al., 1985; turski et al., 1985; zhang et al., 1990;
von lubitz et al., 1993).

previously, we demonstrated that the agonists of adenosine a1 receptors are able to reduce the convulsive
activity of 3-npa (zuchora et al., 2001). the aim of this
study was to evaluate the role of adenosine a1 receptors in
the efficacy of drugs and substances protecting against
seizures related to the 3-npa-evoked inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.

2. experimental procedures
2.1. animals
the experiments were carried out on male albino
swiss mice, weighing 20 – 25 g. animals were kept
under standard laboratory conditions with free access

fig. 1. effect of  xxxd150xxx  on the protective activity of diazepam (a), phenobarbital (b), valproate (c) and gabapentin (d) against 3-npa-evoked seizures.
data are presented as percentages of animals displaying seizures given various concentration of anticonvulsive drugs with 3-npa and saline (control) or with
3-npa and  xxxd150xxx . the calculation of ed50 values and statistical analysis were performed according to the method of litchfield and wilcoxon (1949).
dose regression curves were calculated using graphpad software. (a): control: ed50 = 4.9 (3.1 – 7.6) mg/kg; ( y = 22.247 log(x) + 83.67, r = 0.98);
 xxxd150xxx : ed50 = 14.1 (10.5 – 18.8) mg/kg; ( y = 33.555 log(x) + 143.58, r = 0.96). test for parallelism: slope ratio (s.r.) = 1.161; f ratio s.r. = 3.294;
since f ratio s.r.>s.r. the examined lines are parallel according to litchfield and wilcoxon (1949). test for homogeneity of data: v2 experimental of control and

parallel according to litchfield and wilcoxon (1949). test for homogeneity of data: v2 experimental of control and  xxxd150xxx  were 0.069 and 0.084,
respectively, whereas v2 tabular was 7.82. (c): control: ed50 = 315.6 (224.1 – 444.5) mg/kg; ( y = 62.336 log(x) + 409.22, r = 0.96);  xxxd150xxx :
ed50 = 516.9 (445.0 – 600.4) mg/kg; ( y = 112.11 log(x) + 751.88, r = 0.97). test for parallelism: slope ratio (s.r.) = 1.433; f ratio s.r. = 1.486; since f ratio
s.r.>s.r. the examined lines are parallel according to litchfield and wilcoxon (1949). test for homogeneity of data: v2 experimental of control and
 xxxd150xxx  were 0.203 and 0.334, respectively, whereas v2 tabular was 7.82. (d): control: ed 50 = 270.2 (207.4 – 352.1) mg/kg;

to food and water. the experiments were performed
between 09:00 and 16:00 h. experimental procedures
were approved by the local ethical committee and are
in agreement with european communities council
directives.
2.2. drugs
the substances used in the study included: 3-npa
(sigma, st. louis, mo, usa); r-n6-phenylisopropyloadenosine (r-pia; rbi, natick, ma, usa), 2-chloroadenosine (2-cado; sigma), 8-( p-sulfophenyl)theophylline
(8pspt; rbi), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine
(dpcpx; rbi),  xxxd150xxx , diazepam, sodium salt of
phenobarbital (all polfa; warsaw, poland), sodium valproate (sigma), gabapentin (parke-davis, freiburg, germany). dpcpx was suspended in dmso (sigma). 3-npa,
r-pia, 2-cado,  xxxd150xxx , sodium salt of phenobarbital and sodium valproate were dissolved in water, whereas diazepam and gabapentin were suspended in 1% tween
80 (sigma) and their ph was adjusted to 7.4, when
necessary.
as described before (urbańska et al., 1998b), 3-npa
was given intraperitoneally (i.p.), at the dose of 210.0
mg/kg, being equal to its cd97 dose (i.e. the dose of
drug required to evoke seizures in 97% of animals).
adenosine receptor agonists, 2-cado and r-pia, were
given i.p. 15 min prior to the peripheral injection of 3npa or co-applied (the substances were injected using
different syringes into different body areas of the tested
animals) with 8pspt at the doses of 3.5 and 1.5 mg/kg,
respectively, equal to their ed50 values (i.e. the doses of
drugs required to protect 50% of animals against 3-npainduced seizures) as established in the preliminary
experiments.
all anticonvulsants were applied i.p., 10 min (sodium
valproate), 30 min (diazepam) and 60 min (phenobarbital,
gabapentin) prior to 3-npa administration.  xxxd150xxx ,
non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist and dpcpx,
selective adenosine a1 antagonist were given i.p. simultaneously with 3-npa at the non-convulsive doses. these
were equal to the half of their cd16 values (i.e. the doses of
drugs required to evoke seizures in 16% of animals)
established in the preliminary experiments, and were of
50.0 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. the injection volume was
0.1 ml/10 g of body weight. control animals were given
equivalent volume of the vehicle at the respective time
before the 3-npa injection.
2.3. behavioral observations
each experimental group consisted of at least eight
animals. behavioral observations were performed within
2 h following peripheral 3-npa application. mortality
rate was evaluated at 2 h after the application of
convulsant.

2.4. statistics
the doses of adenosine receptor agonists and antiepileptics necessary to inhibit convulsions/mortality in 50%
of animals tested (ed50) and the doses of 3-npa required
to evoke seizures in 16% and 97% of animals (cd16 and
cd97, respectively) were determined based on the data
obtained from four to five experiments in which different
doses of drugs were evaluated. ed50 values together with
their confidence limits were estimated by computerized

from 3.5 (1.7 – 7.1) to 14.3 (9.5 –21.5) ( p < 0.001) and 11.1
(5.8 –21.5) ( p < 0.05) mg/kg, respectively (fig. 3a, c).
similarly, the administration of  xxxd150xxx  or dpcpx
reduced the protective activity of selective adenosine a1
receptor agonist, r-pia against convulsions induced by 3npa. the ed50 value of r-pia increased from 1.5 (0.7 –
3.3) to 10.7 (5.3 – 21.5) ( p < 0.01) and to 7.0 (3.5 – 21.5)
( p < 0.001) mg/kg, respectively (fig. 3b, d).
the co-administration of  xxxd150xxx  or dpcpx with
2-cado, given at the dose of 10.0 mg/kg i.p. shortened
the respective latencies to the onset of 3-npa-evoked
seizures from 74.3 f 4.3 and 79.0 f 6.8 to 29.4 f 2.1
( p < 0.001) and 31.5 f 2.7 ( p < 0.001) min in comparison
with animals given only 3-npa and 2-cado at the
respective dose (table 3). similarly, the co-administration
of  xxxd150xxx  or dpcpx with r-pia, given at the dose
of 2.5 mg/kg i.p. shortened the latency to the onset of 3npa-evoked seizures from 65.1 f 11.3 and 63.4 f 10.6 to
36.2 f 4.5 ( p < 0.001) and 41.2 f 3.4 ( p < 0.001) min,

slope ratio (s.r.) = 1.134; f ratio s.r. = 2.112; since f ratio s.r.>s.r. the examined lines are parallel according to litchfield and wilcoxon (1949). test for

3.5. effect of 8-( p-sulfophenyl)theophylline on the protective activity of 2-cado and r-pia against 3-npa-evoked
seizures
the administration of 8pspt, at the dose of 20.0 mg/kg
i.p. did not alter the convulsive activity of 3-npa. the coadministration of 8pspt together with adenosine receptor
agonists, 2-cado and r-pia, given i.p. at the doses of 3.5
and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively, has not changed their protective activity (table 4).

4. discussion
the non-selective a1/a2 adenosine receptor antagonist,
 xxxd150xxx , and selective  xxxg81xxx  antagonist,

dpcpx both easily entering the brain impaired the anticonvulsive potential displayed by diazepam, phenobarbital,
valproate and gabapentin against the 3-npa-evoked seizures. in contrast, 8pspt, which does not cross the blood –
brain barrier was not effective. the protective activity of
adenosine receptor agonists, 2-cado and r-pia was also
diminished by the administration of  xxxd150xxx  and
dpcpx, but not of 8pspt. thus, the obtained results
suggest that adenosine receptor antagonists exert their
effects centrally via interaction with adenosine receptors
located within the brain.
these data are in line with our previous observations
showing that adenosine a1 agonists, applied either peripherally or centrally display antiepileptic effects in the model
of 3-npa-evoked convulsions (zuchora et al., 2001). the
hypofunction of adenosine neuromodulation seems to be an

important factor contributing to the convulsive activity
induced by the administration of 3-npa (zuchora et al.,
2001). moreover, presented data indicate that the activation
of adenosine receptors may be one of the mechanisms
involved in the attenuation of 3-npa-induced seizures
displayed by anticonvulsants used in this study.
the adenosine receptor antagonists studied here included
three compounds. non-selective a1/a2 antagonist  xxxd150xxx , interfering also with phosphodiesterases activity is
important in clinic as a drug commonly applied in the
therapy of asthma (fredholm, 1997). second compound,
dpcpx is a selective a1 antagonist and the third, 8pspt is
unable to cross the blood – brain barrier in contrast to

91

previous two (fredholm, 1997). the literature data
concerning the effects of adenosine receptor antagonists
on the protective activity of anticonvulsive drugs are not
equivocal.  xxxd150xxx  has been shown to diminish the
efficacy of diazepam against maximal electroshock-induced
(mes) convulsions (czuczwar et al., 1985) and to decrease
the protective activity of diazepam and phenobarbital (but
not of valproate) in pentylenetetrazol seizure model (kulkarni et al., 1991). theophylline, but not dpcpx diminished the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and valproate
against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats (malhorta
et al., 1996). on the other hand, the protective action of
diazepam, phenobarbital and valproate in mes test was not
reversed by the non-xanthine adenosine a1 antagonist, cgs
15943 (czuczwar et al., 1991). thus, the majority of
previous studies seem to indicate that in mes and pentylenetrazol models the  xxxd150xxx -evoked attenuation of
antiepileptics activity might be not related to the adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  blockade.

different conclusion arises from our studies exploiting
model based on the application of mitochondrial toxin, 3npa, in which not only methylxanthine,  xxxd150xxx , but
also the selective a1/a2 antagonist, dpcpx reduced the
anticonvulsive activity of drugs. interestingly, it was demonstrated that methylxanthine derivatives may decrease the
synthesis of atp in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes
(bruyere et al., 1988; de la cruz et al., 1988), but there is
no data available on the effect of selective adenosine
receptor antagonists on the mitochondrial respiration. however, one could hypothesize that the  xxxd150xxx -induced
reduction of anticonvulsive potential of drugs otherwise
effective in 3-npa model might be, at least partially related
to its action on energy metabolism. this seems improbable
though, because the dose of  xxxd150xxx  used here did not
influence the convulsive action of 3-npa per se.
the mechanisms of action of studied antiepileptics here
are diverse. diazepam and phenobarbital facilitate the
inhibitory gabaergic neurotransmission via enhancement
of gaba-induced chloride conductance, thus causing hyperpolarization of neurons (haefely, 1989; white, 1997).
valproate might inhibit gaba metabolism, augment the
activity of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase that leads to an
increased synthesis of gaba or influence the postsynaptic
gaba receptors (löscher, 2002). moreover, the anticonvulsive effect of valproate might partially result from the
decrease of voltage-dependent sodium currents and the
blockade of t-type calcium currents (löscher, 2002). gabapentin, despite the previously postulated direct gabamimetic activity, does not bind to the gaba receptors. it
might interact with the enzymes or carriers involved in the
glutamate- and gaba-mediated neurotransmission (taylor,
1994; white, 1997), or decrease neuronal calcium influx via
a2d subunit of p/q voltage activated calcium channels
(dooley et al., 2002; oka et al., 2003; shimoyama et al.,
2000).
there are some reports suggesting that adenosine receptor
stimulation may be involved in the action of benzodiazepines
and barbiturates (phillis, 1984; phillis and wu, 1983). the
possibility of functional interaction of adenosine with gaba
has been suggested (phillis and o’regan, 1988). benzodiazepines inhibit the uptake of adenosine leading to its extracellular accumulation (phillis and wu, 1983). the
benzodiazepines-related decrease of excitatory neurotransmission due to the blockade of adenosine uptake has been
demonstrated within ca1 hippocampal region narimatsu
and aoki, 1999). conversely, caffeine and theophylline were
reported to diminish the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines (niemand et al., 1986). adenosine was even
suggested to be able to modulate the gaba/benzodiazepine
receptor chloride channel complex (petersen, 1991). data
obtained here seem to support the view on the possible
involvement of adenosine receptor stimulation in the anticonvulsive activity of certain antiepileptics.
only limited data indicate the existence of inhibitory
presynaptic adenosine a1 receptors modulating cholinergic

nerve function. adenosine a1 receptors may inhibit ca2 +
entry coupled to acetylcholine release (lee et al., 2001;
santos et al., 2000). however, there is no data until now
data indicating the potential role of altered nicotinic transmission in the pathomechanism of seizures evoked by
mitochondrial toxin, 3-npa. moreover, up to our knowledge there are no reports evaluating the influence of altered
nicotinic transmission in the action of studied anticonvulsants. thus, the potential contribution of nicotinic receptorsmediated events to the observed effects seems improbable.
in conclusion, our results suggest that the protective
effects of diazepam, phenobarbital, valproate and gabapentin against 3-npa-evoked seizures may be related, at least
partially, to the central stimulation of adenosine a1 receptors. it seems that when these anticonvulsants are administered together with  xxxd150xxx , their clinical antiepileptic
efficacy might be reduced, especially among patients suffering from seizures related to the disturbances of mitochondrial respiratory chain.
