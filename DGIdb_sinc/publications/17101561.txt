abstract
the  xxxg1480xxx  gene codes for  xxxg1479xxx  reductase, one of the enzymes involved in the
conversion of homocysteine to  xxxd2595xxx . this conversion influences the overall level of total plasma
homocysteine (thcy) and mutations, which reduces the enzyme activity and results in an increased
concentration of thcy. a high homocysteine level is a well-documented independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease. a polymorphism in the gene for  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx  66
awg) has been shown to be associated with the risk of giving birth to a child with down’s syndrome,
and the risk of having a foetus with neural tube defects. we have established a method for analysing
 xxxg1480xxx  66awg on dna from dried blood spots using melting temperature analysis. the dna was
extracted from dried blood spots using a fast procedure by boiling only.

key words: gene frequency, homocysteine,  xxxg1479xxx  reductase, single nucleotide
polymorphism

introduction
it has been estimated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) occur at a frequency of
one per kilobase [1]. snps are becoming known as essential tools as genetic markers for
disease-related alleles. this fact increases the need for rapid and highly reproducible
genotyping technologies.

an example of the significance of snp detection is the investigation into the genetic
background of hyperhomocysteinaemia. elevated homocysteine concentrations in plasma
are a well-documented independent risk factor for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. this is
supported by reports showing that an imbalance involving increased levels of homocysteine
is a risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases [2].
while cardiovascular diseases associated with increased homocysteine levels are usually
caused by significantly elevated levels of homocysteine, alterations at the dna level seem
to be more sensitive. because the demethylation of  xxxd2595xxx  is central in the synthesis of
products such as dna [3], it has been suggested that the process influences the
methylation of dna, and as suggested by hobbs et al. also the recognition of checkpoints
during recombination [4]. malfunctions in the metabolism of homocysteine could well
exert crucial phenotypic effects with widespread consequences. therefore, a simple, highly
reproducible and robust method to detect polymorphisms in genes coding for the enzymes
involved in the conversion of homocysteine would be useful.
clinical and genetic analyses have documented that several mutations in genes involved
in the metabolism of homocysteine result in risk factors for development of, for example,
cardiovascular diseases (for a review see [5]) and neural tube defects [6,7]. genetic
analyses of clinical samples indicate that unidentified genes involved in this pathway are still
to be located [8,9]. one of the identified genes ( xxxg1480xxx ) codes for  xxxg1479xxx 
reductase. this enzyme, which is involved in the conversion of homocysteine to  xxxd2595xxx 
[10], maintains the  xxxd2595xxx  syntase (ms) in an active state for remethylation of
homocysteine to  xxxd2595xxx . until recently, little was known about the possible impact of
polymorphisms in the  xxxg1480xxx  gene on human health.
the identification of a genetic polymorphism in this gene  xxxg1480xxx  66awg (i22m),
leading to replacement of isoleucine with  xxxd2595xxx , has proved to be significantly
associated with the risk of giving birth to a child with down’s syndrome (or 2.57 95 % ci
1.33–4.99) [4], (or 10.47 95 % ci 1.4–78.6) [11], and (or 6.7 95 % ci 1.4–32.0) [12],
combined with low levels of cobalamin also carrying a foetus with spina bifida (or 4.8
95 % ci 1.5–15.8) [6]. zhu et al. showed a 2.6-fold (95 % ci 1.3–5.3) higher risk of
neural tube defect in infants with the  xxxg1480xxx  66awg variant [13]. the polymorphism also
seems to play a role in the risk for developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [14].
vmax of msr is unaffected by the polymorphism, but a 4-fold higher molar ratio to ms
is necessary for maximal activation of ms with the  xxxg1480xxx  66a variant compared to the
 xxxg1480xxx  66g [15].
the prevalence of this polymorphism has been shown to vary substantially in different
ethnic populations [16], and even within the caucasian populations [11,17,18]. the
prevalence of this polymorphism in the scandinavian background populations has not
previously been investigated.
the aim of this study was to develop a simple and highly reproducible method for
analysing  xxxg1480xxx  66awg on small amounts of dna, extracted with a minimum of
handling from archived guthrie cards, known as pku cards in denmark, to determine the
frequency of the snp in the danish background population.
the method described in this study is based on the restriction cleavage assay previously
described by wilson et al. 1999 [6].
since our attempt to achieve high sensitivity and specificity using the method developed
by wilson et al. did not succeed, we had to design another method which could be used on
dna isolated from pku cards. we chose the lightcycler from roche as the platform for
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. this led to the development of a new

detection of the  xxxg1480xxx  66arg polymorphism

method for genotyping by restriction enzyme cleavage and subsequent analysis based on
end-point analysis and tm values.
we present the use of the lightcycler pcr instrument for high-speed dna
amplification followed by genetic analysis. the genotyping based on end-point analysis
of tm values is simple and highly reproducible. to our knowledge, this technique has not
been described previously and therefore we did the cross-sampling using the conventional
method.

material and methods
samples
the prevalence of the  xxxg1480xxx  66awg mutation in the danish background population was
investigated in 385 anonymous and randomly selected phenylketonuria (pku) cards from
danish newborns (4–5 days old). pku cards are specimens of blood collected on filter
paper for neonatal screening, and are available for 95 % of all danish newborns. the pku
cards were selected at random by the staff of statens serum institut. the exact ethnic
origin of the pku cards is unknown, but the ethnic composition reflects the composition of
the general danish population. the use of the pku cards was approved by the local ethics
committee and the danish data protection agency.

extraction of dna
genomic dna was extracted from the pku cards by cutting a circular sample with a
diameter of 5.2 mm from the blood spot and transferring the sample into a 1.5 ml tube;
300 ml sterile water was added and the samples were incubated for 20 min at 95˚c
followed by a 15,000g centrifugation for 15 min at 4˚c. the dna was stored at 4˚c.
pcr amplification
a fragment spanning between nucleotide 154 and 219 (nm 024010 ncbi) of the  xxxg1480xxx 
gene was amplified and analysed for the  xxxg1480xxx  66awg polymorphism by enzyme
cleavage. primers and restriction enzymes used to detect the polymorphism were designed
according to the method by wilson et al. [6]. amplification with these primers introduces a
ndei restriction site, when amplifying an a allele.
pcr amplification was carried out in glass capillary cuvettes in a total volume of 20 ml
containing 1.6 ml faststart dna master sybr green i (roche), 2.4 ml mgcl2 25 mm
(roche), 12 ml h2o (roche), 2 ml template, 20 pmol sense primer and 20 pmol antisense
primer. all the reaction components were mixed on ice.
pcr was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation step at 95˚c
(10 min, ramp rate 20˚c/s) followed by amplification for 32–40 cycles of denaturation
(95˚c 10 s, ramp rate 20˚c/s), annealing (68˚c for 10 s, ramp rate 20˚c/s, target 58˚c step
size 0.5˚c with 1 cycle delay), and extension (72˚c for 16 s, ramp rate 20˚c/s). the
amplified dna fragment was 66 base pairs (bp).
after amplification, melting curves were generated at 95˚c (0 s, ramp rate 20˚c/s), 58˚c
(10 s, ramp rate 20˚c/s) and 95˚c (0 s, ramp rate 0.1˚c/s, acquisition mode: continuous),
and finally a cooling step for 30 s at 40˚c (figure 1).

restriction cleavage
the  xxxg1480xxx  66awg polymorphism was detected by ndei cleavage of pcr products of
66 bp.
four microlitres restriction enzyme ndei (20.000u/ml), 4 ml nebuffer 4 (new
england biolab) and 12 ml sterile h2o was mixed and added directly to the glass capillary
containing 20 ml pcr product (of 66 bp). the capillaries were spun for a few seconds and
incubated for 24 h at 37˚c to reach complete cleavage.
the pcr fragment of 66 bp remained uncut in the presence of the g allele, while the a
allele was cleaved into fragments of 44 and 22 (see figure 2).

controls
a non-template control was performed in every run to test for contamination. to verify the
cleavage efficiency of the restriction enzyme, a sample with genotype  xxxg1480xxx  66a/a was
also included in every run. figure 2 shows the complete cleavage results in two fragments.
genotyping by gel electrophoresis

for validation of the obtained genotyping of  xxxg1480xxx  66 on lightcycler, 76 samples were
run in parallel on a 4 % metaphor agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. the gel was
electrophoresed at 80 v for 15 min (see figure 3).
genotyping  xxxg1480xxx  66 on lightcycler on the basis of tm values
following the restriction of enzyme cleavage, melting curves were generated at 95˚c (0 s,
ramp rate 20˚c/s), 58˚c (10 s, ramp rate 20˚c/s) and 95˚c (0 s, ramp rate 0.1˚c/s,
acquisition mode: continuous), and finally a cooling step for 30 s at 40˚c. the composition
of the alleles was determined based on the tm values found by melting curve analysis of the
cleavage product using lightcycler3 data analysis software.
tm values are dependent on the length of the dna fragment and the base composition.
since the amplified products after restriction cleavage 66 bp (uncut), 44 bp and 22 bp
differed in length and base composition, the melting analysis resulted in different tm
values. figure 2 shows the tm of the uncut fragment of 66 bp and the fragment of 44 bp
with tm values of 79 and 74˚c, respectively (see figure 4).

figure 3. determination of  xxxg1480xxx  66 genotype by gel electrophoresis. the figure shows the pcr product from
the  xxxg1480xxx  gene before restriction cleavage as well as the genotypes g/g, a/a and a/g after restriction enzyme
cleavage with ndei. the pcr fragment of 66 bp remains uncut in the presence of the g allele, but is digested into
fragments of 44 bp and 22 bp when the a allele is present.

the tm value of the smallest fragment of 22 bp is probably represented by the small
peak at lower tm. however, this peak was not used in the genotyping of the sample.

results
validation of the assay
our assay was in full agreement with data obtained from gel electrophoresis (76 samples).
in the presence of very small amounts of pcr products, the genotyping using the
lightcycler was superior to gel electrophoresis analysis, as we found the electrophoresis to
be inconclusive, whereas the melting curve analysis was unambiguous.
in a few instances, the melting curve analysis resulted in an ambiguous result and the gel
electrophoresis confirmed that the reason for this was inadequate pcr amplification. a
new pcr product was generated in these cases.
data analysis
blood samples from 385 pku cards from danish newborns were screened for the point
mutation/polymorphism  xxxg1480xxx  66awg using restriction cleavage.
we found that the a and g allele frequencies in the danish background population were
43.2 (95 % ci 39.7–46.8) and 56.8 % respectively. the a/a, a/g and g/g genotype

frequencies were 18.4, 49.6 and 31.9 %, respectively, in agreement with the hardyweinberg prediction (p50.835).

discussion
the use of pku screening cards to estimate the gene frequency in the background
population is a highly reliably method, because bias caused by postnatal selection is
avoided. the frequency of 43.2 % found in this study in the danish population is in
reasonable concordance with the frequencies found in other caucasian populations:
[7,11,12,16–26]. until now, no systematic studies of the frequencies in populations with
different ethnic backgrounds have been carried out.
genetic analysis of snps is frequently performed using conventional assays based on
labelled oligo hybridization. as the major difficulty of this assay is a reproducible pcr
amplification, we chose to use a rapid and sensitive pcr instrument for optimizing the
assay. furthermore, using the lightcycler gave us the opportunity to simplify the data
interpretation and handling, thus avoiding the gel electrophoresis of the original method by
wilson et al.
this study presents a new, simple, reproducible and highly sensitive method for
analysing  xxxg1480xxx  66awg on dna extracted from dried blood spots based on end-point
analysis of pcr products.
we have established a method of analysing  xxxg1480xxx  66awg on small amounts of dna
extracted from archived pku cards with a minimum of handling and a considerable
reduction in time, cost and effort. the method has high sensitivity and specificity in terms
of melting temperature analysis based on real-time pcr. we have demonstrated that
genotyping with the lightcycler technology is faster, more reproducible and sensitive than
the assay based on gel electrophoresis. this method proved to be suitable for detecting
small dna fragments.
the efficient heating and cooling of the glass capillaries inherent to the lightcycler pcr
has most likely increased the sensitivity and specificity to a level that yields reproducible
results from analyses based on dna isolated from pku cards.
faststart taq dna polymerase used in this pcr remains inactive at room temperature
and is activated by incubation at 95˚c for 10 min. this minimizes any unspecific
background and consequently enhances specificity of the pcr amplification.
further optimization may be possible and may thus increase the throughput. higher
concentrations of ndei enzyme might shorten the time used for restriction cleavage
considerably. however, to our knowledge, the ndei enzyme is not available in higher
concentrations. using primers and afliii enzyme described by jacques et al. [27] providing
more efficient restriction digestion may also reduce restriction cleavage time.
if good quality dna is available, other methods could be more efficient for clinical use.
we have developed the method for analysing dna extracted from pku cards initially to
determine the prevalence of  xxxg1480xxx  66awg in the danish background population. this
could be a suitable method for larger epidemiological studies, especially if only a small
amount or partly degraded dna is available.
