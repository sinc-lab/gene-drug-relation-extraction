all dna (cytoslne-5)-methyrtransferases contain a
single conserved cysteine. it has been proposed that
this cysteine initiates catalysis by attacking the c6 of
cytosine and thereby activating the normally inert c5
position. we show here that substitutions of this
cysteine in the e.coll methylase af.ecorii with either
serlne or tryptophan results in a complete loss of ability
to transfer methyl groups to dna. interestingly,
mutants with either serlne or glyclne substitution bind
tightly to substrate dna. these mutants resemble the
wild-type enzyme in that their binding to substrate is
not eliminated by the presence of non-specific dna in
the reaction, it is sensitive to methylatlon status of the
substrate and is stimulated by an analog of the methyl
donor. hence the conserved cysteine is not essential
for the specific stable binding of the enzyme to its
substrate. however, substitution of the cysteine with
the bulkier tryptophan does reduce dna binding. we
also report here a novel procedure for the synthesis
of dna containing 5-fluorocytoslne. further, we show
that a dna substrate for m.fcorii in which the target
cytosine is replaced by  xxxd2119xxx  is a
mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme and that it
forms an irreversible complex with the enzyme. as
expected, this modified substrate does not form
irreversible complexes with the mutants.
introduction
methylation of position 5 of cytosines is the most common
modification of dna found in nature. 5-methylcytosine plays
a variety of biological roles including distinguishing host dna
from foreign dna, regulation of gene expression and tagging
regions of sequence duplications for rapid evolution [reviewed
in (1, 2)]. recent studies of dna (cytosine-5) methyltransferases
(c5 methylases) from a number of sources have clearly
established that these enzymes evolved from a common ancestor.
all c5 methylases carry several conserved sequence motifs and
* to whom correspondence should be addressed

the organization of these motifs within these enzymes is similar
(3-5).
d.santi and his colleagues have pointed out that the known
inhibition of c5 methylases from procaryotic sources (6) and
eucaryotic sources (7) by 5- xxxd253xxx , 5-fluorocytidine and other
cytidine analogs could be explained by a common reaction
mechanism for these enzymes (8). according to this mechanism,
the reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic attack at the c6 position
of cytosine by the enzyme. production of this michael adduct
creates a negative charge at c5, thereby activating a normally inert
carbon (8). the methyl group is transferred to c5 as a result of
an electrophilic attack of a carbon from s-adenosyl-l-meuiionine
(sam). in the process, the cofactor is converted to s-adenosyll-homocysteine (sah). when the target cytosine is replaced by
5-azacytosine or  xxxd2119xxx , the michael adduct becomes
stable causing an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme (8).
wu and santi have proposed (9) that a cysteine conserved
among all c5 methylases is the nucleophile that initiates the
methyl transfer reaction. this cysteine lies in the most conserved
sequence motif for the methylases called motif iv (4). the
proposal of wu and santi was based largely on similarities
between the reaction carried out by  xxxg2366xxx  (ts)
and c5 methylases, and on the identification of the analogous
nucleophile in ts as cysteine (10, 11). two lines of evidence
support this hypothesis. an irreversible covalent complex between
m.haeul and dna substrate containing 5-fluorodeoxycytidine
(5-fdc) was isolated by chen et al. (12). when this complex
was digested with either pronase or trypsin, the dna was found
to be linked to short peptides that contained the conserved
cysteine. the cysteine itself appeared to be modified and could
not be directly identified in the sequencing reactions. however,
the lack of reactivity of this residue towards iodoacetamide was
consistent with it being linked to dna (12). friedman and ansari
have presented parallel evidence (13) supporting a similar role
for the conserved cysteine in the e.coli methylase m.ecorti.
these investigators isolated a covalent complex between
m.£rorii and 5-fdc-containing substrate and subjected it to
protease v8 digestion. the peptide linked to the dna was

materials and methods
oligonucleotide synthesis
all the dna oligomers except for the 5-fdc-containing 14-mer
were synthesized at the macromolecular facility (wayne state
university). synthesis of the 5-fdc-containing oligomer was done
as follows: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine was synthesized from
2'-deoxyuridine (sigma chemicals, st. louis, mo) in the
laboratory of d.cech (humboldt university, berlin, germany)
together with c.-d pein. 5-fluoro-2'- xxxd1836xxx  was obtained
from 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine using procedures that have been
described before (15, 16). 5'-0-dimethoxytrityl derivative of the
5-fluoro-2'- xxxd1836xxx  was obtained by standard methods (17).
the products of the reaction were separated on a silica gel column
and the desired product was eluted with a 0—10% gradient of
ethanol in chloroform. benzoylation at n4 position was achieved
by adding benzoic anhydride to 5'-o-dimethoxytrityl-5-fluoro2'- xxxd1836xxx  dissolved in ethanol. the reaction was
monitored by thin layer chromatography with chlroform-ethanol
(9:1, v/v). the desired reaction product was separated from other
products by silica gel chromatography. the yield of this reaction
was 45%. 3'-n, n-diisopropylamidomethylphosphite of the 5'-odimethoxytrityl-n4-benzoyl-5-fluoro-2'- xxxd1836xxx  was
obtained by a previously described procedure (18). this modified
nucleotide was incorporated in the nonamer 5'-ftggatccg
(f = 5-fdq using the dna synthesizer 38ob by applied
biosystems (boulder, co). the procedure used to deprotect the
oligomer is described in the 'results'. this nonamer was
phosphorylated at its 5'-end and was hybridized to the oligomer
5'-acggatccaggagtgac along with the oligomer
5'-cactc. this created the nicked duplex
5'-cactc ftggatccg
3'-cagtgag-gacctaggca.
the nick was sealed with t4 dna ligase and the resulting
14-mer widi 5-fdc was purified by elution from a 20%
polyacrylamide gel.

protein purification
the host for the overproducing plasmids carrying the genes for
the wild type m.ecorii and its mutants was the e. coli b strain
bl21 (de3) [f~ ompt hsds\ with a phage x lysogen (imm21
int) which contains t7 rna polymerase gene under the lac uv5
promoter (19). the plasmid constructs pt71-cys, pt71-ser, and
pt71-trp carrying the genes for the wild type enzyme, c186s
mutant, and c186w mutant, respectively, have been described
before (14).
e.coli bl21(de3) harboring the appropriate overproducer was
first grown overnight in 5 ml of luria broth (lb) medium
containing 50 /tg/ml carbenicillin. two and one half ml of the
overnight culture was then transferred to a 2-liter flask containing
one liter of fresh lb medium and 50 /tg/ml carbenicillin. the
flask was incubated at 37°c on a shaking platform. when
od550 of the culture reached between 0.3 to 0.4, isopropyl-/3d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 120
/tg/ml, and growth was continued for another 3 to 4 hrs. cells
were collected by centrifugation in a sorvall gsa rotor at 4000g
for 20 min. typically, one liter of cells yielded about 2 grams
of wet cells. to prepare cell-free extracts, 1.6 grams of cells
were resuspended in 25 ml of 'low salt buffer'-buffer a (10 mm
potassium phosphate, ph 7.0; 1 mm edta; and 10 mm
2- xxxd26xxx ) with 0.1 m nacl. the suspension was treated
with 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme on ice for 10 min, quickly frozen in
a dry-ice/ethanol bath, thawed at 37°c, and then returned to ice.
cells were then sonicated five times with 20 seconds pulses, and
the cell debris was removed by centrifugation in a ss-34 rotor
(sorvall) at 12,000g for 20 min. the supernatant was diluted twofold with low salt buffer and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride was
added to a final concentration of 25 /tg/m.
a cellulose phosphate (sigma, st louis, mo.) column
(2.5x20 cm) was equilibrated with the low salt buffer and the
cell-free extarct was loaded onto it. the column was washed with
70 ml of the low salt buffer at 0.5 ml/min. the enzyme was eluted
from the column with a linear gradient of 0.1m to 0.8m nacl
in buffer a. the methylase and its mutants eluted as a single
peak at about 0.5 m nacl. fractions (20 to 30 ml) within this
peak were pooled and dialyzed for 5 hrs against 45 % glycerol
solution containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.0, and
10 mm 2- xxxd26xxx . after dialysis, bovine  xxxg124xxx 
was added to a final concentration of 200 /ig/ml, and the purified
enzyme was stored at -20°c or -70°c.
assay for methyl transfer to dna
the procedure for the methyl transfer assay has been described
before (14).
radioactive labeling of dna and the formation of duplexes
the labeling reaction typically contained 2 0 - 5 0 pmole of dna,
60-150 mci of (y- 3 2 p)-atp (3000 ci/mmol, nen/dupont,
boston, ma), and 10 units of t4 polynucleotide kinase (new
england biolabs, beverly, ma) in 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.8),
10 mm mgcl2 and 5 mm dtt in final volume of 50 /d. the
reaction was performed at 37 °c for 30 min and was terminated
by adding 2 /tl of 0.5 m edta followed by heating to 70°c
for 5 min. a two-fold molar excess of unlabeled dna was added
to this reaction mixture, and the volume of the hybridization
mixture was brought up to 100 /tl with te (10 mm tris-hcl,
ph 7.8 and 1 mm edta). the hybridization mixture was then

sequenced and was found to contain the conserved cysteine (13).
once again, the cysteine itself appeared to be modified and could
not be identified by the sequencing procedure.
recently, we reported the isolation of mutants of m.ecowi
that contain substitutions of the conserved cysteine (cys-186) by
six different amino acids—alanine, glutamine, glycine, serine,
tryptophan and valine (14). cell-free lysates containing these
mutant proteins were unable to transfer methyl groups to dna
and a genetic test for the covalent linking of the enzyme to
5-a2adeoxycytosine-containing dna found evidence for complex
formation with only the wild-type enzyme and the mutant with
the serine substitution. these observations are consistent with
an essential nucleophilic role for cys-186 in the methyl-transfer
reaction of m.ecorh. surprisingly, our studies with the mutant
carrying glycine at position 186 found that the expression of this
protein was highly toxic to e. coli. we describe here a biochemical
study of some of these mutants that focuses on the non-covalent
and covalent interactions between the enzyme and its substrate.
it specifically addresses the question of whether the inability of
the mutants to transfer methyl groups to dna is the result of
a lack of binding to the substrate or due to defect in a step
subsequent to dna-binding.

heated at 90°c for 3 min and the two strands were annealed by
allowing the mixture to cool slowly to 30°c. this solution was
then extracted once with phenol/chloroform and once with
chloroform. finally, the unincorporated (7-32p)-atp was
removed from the reaction by spin-dialysis (20) through a
sephadex g-50 column (pharmacia-lkb, piscataway, nj).

results and discussion
purification of the wild-type m.ecorii and its mutants
a procedure for the purification of the wild-type m.ecorii has
been described by friedman (21). the procedure involves several
steps including five steps with chromatography. however, when
we started the purification with cell extracts prepared from an
overproducer of the enzyme (14), we found that the first two
step of the procedure produced enzyme that appeared to be
substantially pure ( - 9 0 % homogeneous, fig. 1 and data not
shown). this improvement in the purification procedure was

binding of the enzyme and its mutants to normal dna
the lack of methyl-transferring ability in the mutants could be
due to a variety reasons. for example, a loss of dna binding
ability as a result of the mutations could also prevent methyltransfer to dna. to test this possibility, we studied the specific
binding of m.£corh and its mutants to substrate dna by the
gel mobility shift assay. this assay can detect the formation of
specific stable protein—dna complexes and has been used to
study the interaction between a large number of dna-binding
proteins and their substrates. in particular, it has been used to
study the interaction of the n6-adenine methylases dam (22) and
m.ecosl (23), and several c5 methylases including m.mspl (24)
and the bacillus phage-coded methylases m.h11, m.rl lsl (25)
with their respective substrates.
the three dna duplexes used in these experiments differ from
each other only in their state of methylation (duplexes i, ii and
hi; table i). while the unmethylated dna (duplex i) and the
hemi-methylated dna (duplex ii) would be expected to form
specific complexes with the wt enzyme under appropriate
conditions, the fully-methylated substrate would be expected to

dna binding reactions and gel electrophoresis
the dna binding reactions contained 100 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.8), 20 mm edta, 3 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 100 /tg/ml bsa,
1—2 pmole of labeled duplex, 30 ng poly-di:dc, appropriate
cofactor  xxxd1891xxx  mm, and 73 pmole of protein (~4 /tg), except
where noted. reaction volumes were typically 50 id. the
reactions were incubated at 37°c for 30-90 min, and analyzed
by electrophoresis performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels at
25°c for approximately four hours at 150 volts. denaturing gels
were performed with the inclusion of 0.1 % sds both in the gel
and in the electrophoresis buffer. following electrophoresis, the
gels were fixed using a 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution
and autoradiographs were prepared using x-ray film rx (fuji
film, japan).

probably due to the fact that the strain used in the present study
produces about 170-fold more methylase than the strain used by
friedman (14, 21). mutants of m.ecorii with substitutions of
the conserved cysteine to serine (c186s) or to tryptophan
(c186w) could also be purified by this procedure. a comparison
of the protein compositions of crude lysates of the overproducing
strains with the purified protein preparations is presented in
figure 1. wild-type (wt) enzyme and the mutants prepared in
this way were used in the assays described below.
when the ability of the purified proteins to transfer 3h-methyl
groups from s-[methyl-3h]-methionine to dna was studied, no
activity could be detected for the c186s and c186w mutants
(fig. 2). the amounts of 3 h seen with these mutants were
typically about 5,000 to 10,000-fold less than those seen with
the wt enzyme and were indistinguishable from background.
these results are consistent with our earlier report (14) in which
no methyl transfer activity was detected in cell-free extracts of
these mutants.

bind poorly to the enzyme. to assure that any observed
complexes would not be due to non-specific binding of the
enzyme to dna, an excess of poly-dl.dc was included in these
reactions.
in the presence of sah, the wt enzyme formed specific stable
complexes with duplexes i and n, but not with duplex hi (fig. 3,
lanes 4, 5 and 6). this complex formation was substantially
reduced if no cofactor was added or if sam was present in the
reaction (not shown). in the latter case, the enzyme probably
bound duplexes i and ii, methylated them during the binding
reaction or during gel electrophoresis and then dissociated from
the fully methylated dna. to confirm this, we subjected an
unmethylated dna duplex to the binding reaction in the presence
of sam and then challenged it with ecorh endonuclease. the
dna was resistant to £corii (not shown). this contrasts with
the behavior of m.mspi which forms complexes with substrate
dna in the presence of sam or sah as well as in the absence
of added cofactor analogs (24). however, it should be pointed
out that the gel mobility shift assay is only able to detect stable
protein-dna complexes and any unstable complexes formed by
m.ecokk with dna would not be detected by this assay. our
preliminary studies using a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay do,
in fact, suggest that m.£corii can bind tightly to substrate dna
in the absence of added cofactor analogs (not shown).
the c186s mutant discriminates between the substrate duplexes
(duplexes i and ii) and the product duplex (duplex hi) in the
same manner as the wt enzyme. it forms specific stable
complexes with duplexes i and ii and the complexes have gel
mobilities comparable to the mobilities of the complexes formed
by the wt enzyme (fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). such complexes were
not seen between c186s and duplex m (fig. 3, lane 9). in
contrast, no specific stable complexes could be detected between
the c186w mutant and any of the duplexes under these conditions
(fig. 3, lanes 10, 11 and 12). in some experiments, trace amounts
of complexes between c186w and duplex n were seen (see
below); however, it is clear that the substitution of the cysteine
by tryptophan reduces severely die ability of the protein to form
specific stable complexes.

using cell-free extracts containing the c186g mutant, we were
able show that this protein binds tightly and specifically to
duplexes i and ii (fig. 3, lanes 13 and 14). in contrast, little
complex formation could be detected between duplex eh and
c186g (fig. 3, lane 15). therefore, the c186g has substrate
specificity similar to the wt enzyme and c186s mutant. the
ability of this mutant to discriminate between the substrate and
the reaction product was tested using cell-free extracts—rather
than purified protein—because it has been exceedingly difficult
to purify this protein. the difficulty stems, in part, from the lethal
effects of this mutant on die host cells (14) and partly from the
paucity of free protein inside the cells (data not shown).
based on these results, we conclude that cys-186 of m.ecorii
does not have an essential role in the recognition of base sequence
by the enzyme, in tight binding of the enzyme to dna, or in
the discrimination between the substrate and the final product
by the enzyme. substitutions of the cysteine by amino acids with
smaller side-chains (serine and glycine) appear to cause little
qualitative change in die non-covalent interactions between the
enzyme and substrate, while its substitution widi the bulkier
tryptophan disrupts some of these interactions. we predict that
mutants such as c186a should bind tightly to the substrate, while
mutants such as c186t and c186l should bind poorly to it.
synthesis of 5-fluorodeoxycytidine containing dna
if the conserved cysteine in m.&orq is responsible for the attack
of c6 of cytosine, some of the mutants of the enzyme with
substitutions of diis residue may not carry out this reaction. to
test this, we decided to construct a substrate for m.ecdkr which
can trap the covalent intermediate in the methyl transfer reaction.
this was achieved by replacing the target cytosine with
 xxxd2119xxx . the model of catalysis by santi et al. (8)
suggests diat methyl transfer to c5 is essential for making a
covalent complex between the enzyme and a substrate containing
5-fdc, irreversible. as all die mutants of m.ecorii isolated so

the recognition site for m.ecorh (ccwgg) is underlined. the enzyme transfers
a methyl group to the second cytosine in the sequence, 'me'—methyl group at
position 5; f—5-fluorodeoxycytidine.

far with substitution of cys-186 are defective in methyl transfer
[(14) and fig. 2], any complexes formed by the mutants with
such a dna substrate should not be irreversible.
osterman et al. (26) have noted that an intermediate in the
chemical synthesis of  xxxd2119xxx  containing oligonucleotides—5'-o-dimethoxytrityl-n4-benzoyl-5-fluoro-2'- xxxd1836xxx  (dmt-bz-5-fdc)—is unstable during the acidic
treatment used to remove the dimethoxytrityl protecting groups.
the removal of these protecting groups is essential for the
elongation steps in the oligonucleotide synthesis. to avoid such
instability, we changed the scheme of synthesis such that the
5-fiuorodeoxycytidine (5-fdc) incorporated into the oligonucleotide was not subjected to further cycles of chemical linking and
deprotection. dmt-bz-5-fdc was introduced into the 5' end of
the oligonucleotides during their standard automated chemical
synthesis. then the modified oligonucleotide was subjected to
acid treatment only after removal of the alkali-labile protecting
groups andreverse-phasehplc. the nonamer 5'-ftggatccg
(f= 5-fdc) was phosphorylated at its 5'-end and ligated to
5'-cactc (see materials and methods). the sequence of the
resulting 14-mer was confirmed by the chemical sequencing
method. the presence of 5-fdc in the oligomer was confirmed
by separating the nucleosides generated by the enzymatic
degradation of the oligomer by hplc (not shown).
binding of m.ecovh to a substrate containing 5-fdc
the substrate for the binding experiments was duplex iv (table
1)—a hybrid between the 14-mer mentioned above and its
(methylated) complement. it was identical to duplex ii except
for the substitution of the target cytosine by  xxxd2119xxx 
(table 1). as the complementary strand was methylated, the
enzyme was expected to transfer methyl group to only the
fluorinated cytosine. if the target cytosine in the complementary
strand were to be unmethylated, binding of the enzyme to such
dna may be the result of an attempt by the enzyme to transfer
a methyl group to this cytosine. further, any observed transfer

the duplexes were labeled at their 5'-cnd with 3 p and the binding reactions were
carried out as described in materials and methods. following the binding reaction,
one half of each reaction was electrophoresed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide
gel and the other half was electrophoresed in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.
only the native gel is shown here. the duplex used in the reactions, the presence

of methyl groups to such a substrate could involve two separate
methyl transfers to the two strands.
the wt enzyme forms specific stable complexes with duplex
iv in the presence of sam (fig. 4, a, lane 2). in the absence
of cofactor, little complex formation is detected (fig. 4, a, lane
1). however, a small amount of complex could be detected in
that lane upon longer exposures during autoradiography (not
shown). existence of tightly bound sam to a small fraction of
the enzyme preparation could explain such complexes. as
expected, the complexes observed in the presence of sam were
stable to sds and heat treatment (fig. 4, b, lane 2). therefore
m.ecokh forms an irreversible covalent complex with a substrate
in which the target cytosine is replaced by 5-fdc.
the enzyme also forms specific stable complexes with duplex
iv in the presence of sah (fig. 4, a, lane 3). these complexes
were similar in mobility to the complexes formed in the presence
of sam (fig. 4, a, lane 2) and were partially resistant to
denaturation (fig. 4, b, lane 3). the only difference between
the complexes formed in the presence of sam and sah appeared
to be their relative stabilities. the complexes formed by the
enzyme in the presence of sah were significantly reduced by
the denaturation treatment. further, a longer exposure of the gel
to x-ray film revealed a smear of radioactivity between the
complex and the free dna (not shown). it has been noted above
that the proposed reaction mechanism predicts that methyl transfer
to c5 is required to make such complexes irreversible (8).
therefore, it was surprising to find that the complexes formed
between duplex iv and the wt enzyme when sah was present
in the reaction were not completely dissociated by the denaturing
treatment. it is unlikely that the resistant complexes were formed
by the fraction of the enzyme carrying bound sam. if it were
so, then an equally strong signal should have appeared when no
cofactor was added to the reaction. no such complex was seen
(fig. 4, b, lane 1). we suggest that the complexes formed in

the binding reactions, the samples were divided in two halves. one half of each

are shown here. the location of the specific complexes is identified with an arrow.

binding of m.ecorh mutants to a substrate containing 5-fdc
only trace amounts of complexes were seen when duplex iv was
incubated with c186s in die presence of sam (fig. 5, lane 4)
and no complexes were seen in the absence of sam (fig. 5, lane
3). the amounts of complexes seen between c186s and duplex
iv were much lower than me amounts seen with duplex n
(compare lanes 4 and 2 in fig. 5). this suggests that die fluorine
at c5 of cytosine causes some hindrance to the binding of the
enzyme to dna. in this sense the fluorine at position 5 may
mimic a methyl group. complexes were also observed when
extracts containing c186g were incubated with duplex iv (not
shown). once again, c186w mutant served as a negative control.
no complexes were detected between c186w and duplex iv
(fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8). the length of exposure of this
autoradiograph was much longer uian used for figures 3 and
4 and as a result small amounts of sam-dependent stable complex
formation between c186w and duplex n (fig. 5, lane 6). for
die same reason, a small amount of complex formation was
detected between c186s and duplex ii in the absence of added
cofactor.
as mentioned earlier, if die transfer of methyl group to c5
is required to make die complex between the enzyme and 5-fdccontaining substrate irreversible, then none of die mutants widi
substitutions of cys-186 should form irreversible complexes with
duplex iv. this was confirmed by splitting the binding reactions
in two halves, boiling one half of each reaction in the presence
of sds and electrophoresing diem under denaturing conditions.
no complexes between c186s and duplex iv were detected by
autoradiography of the denaturing gel (not shown). the
undenatured halves of these reactions were used for die gel seen
in figure 5. in similar experiments, die binding of c186g to
duplex iv was also found to be sensitive to denaturation (not
shown). hence the binding of c186s and c186g mutants widi
5-fdc containing dna must eidier be non-covalent interactions
or involves covalent links mat are easily reversible.
we have shown mat substitutions of cys-186 in m.£corii
eliminate its ability to transfer mediyl groups to substrate dna.
therefore, cys-186 must play an essential role(s) in die mediyl

transfer reaction. this is die only residue in dna
metiiyltransferases for which a functional role has been identified.
our previous genetic studies of m.ecorii (14) and die
biochemical studies of odiers of die covalent complexes between
m.haeth and m.ecokr widi 5-fdc-containing substrates (12,
13) have confirmed that one of diese roles is in attacking die c6
of die target cytosine.
our genetic studies have also suggested diat diis cysteine may
have an additional unknown role(s) in mediyl transfer (14).
further, none of diese studies have eliminated die possibility diat
die conserved cysteine may have additional roles unrelated to
catalysis. the residue could have a structural role in die protein,
or it could be involved in die specific or non-specific interactions
of die enzyme widi dna. there is precedent for a cysteine to
have a role in specific dna-binding. in die fos-jun families of
transcription factors and in papilloma virus protein e2, the redox
state of a conserved cysteine plays a key role in dna-binding
(30, 31). further, in die case of fos-jun proteins a substitution
of diis cysteine to serine increases die affinity of these proteins
to dna (30). however, die data presented here argues diat die
conserved cysteine in m.£corii is not essential for die sequencespecific, cofactor-dependent interaction between die enzyme and
its substrate.
we have shown diat die mutants of m.ecorh in which die
conserved cysteine is replaced by omer residues are useful for
dissecting die mediyl transfer reaction of c5 mediylases. further
biochemical studies of diese mutants should help one understand
die reaction in a greater detail.

the presence of sah do involve covalent linking of the enzyme
to dna, and that these links are reversed at a slow rate following
the denaturation of the enzyme.
recently, several groups have presented other strategies to
circumvent the problems of acid lability during the chemical
synthesis of 5-fdc containing oligomers (13, 27—29). friedman
and ansari (13) prepared the substrate for m.£corh by the
enzymatic polymerization of a template-primer hybrid in the
presence of 5-fdctp in the reaction and demonstrated the
formation of an irreversible complex between the enzyme and
this dna. however, their syndiesis procedure could not ensure
that the dna that was used in the analysis of the covalent
complex contained 5-fdc only at the site of methyl transfer.
smith et al. (29) have prepared the substrate for the human
methyltransferase using 5-fdctp and have demonstrated the
formation of a covalent complex between the enzyme and the
dna. finally, two groups have used chemical methods to
synthesize substrates with 5-fdc and have used these dnas to
demonstrate the irreversible covalent unking of m.haeul (12)
and of the e. coli methylase dem (hanck et al., this issue) with
their respective substrates. thus the key prediction of the
proposed mechanism of c5 methylases (8) has been amply and
independently confirmed.
