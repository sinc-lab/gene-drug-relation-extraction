through inhibition of angiogenesis

in multiple myeloma (mm), the interaction between myeloma
cells and bone marrow microenvironment has an important role
in the pathogenesis of mm. we first examined the inducing
effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein
vascular endothelial cells (huvecs). five myeloma cell lines
produced varying amounts of vegf, and migration of huvecs
was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. we next
examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic retinoid
 xxxd3284xxx  ( xxxd3284xxx ) on both myeloma cells and huvecs.
 xxxd3284xxx  is specific for the retinoic-acid receptor-a/b, and has
therapeutic effects in all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  resistant acute
 xxxg1785xxx .  xxxd3284xxx  slightly inhibited the growth of
both myeloma cells and huvecs, and remarkably inhibited the
growth of huvecs stimulated by vegf.  xxxd3284xxx  showed little
growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (bmscs), but it
markedly inhibited migration of huvecs by cocultured myeloma cells.  xxxd3284xxx  inhibited vegf-induced phosphorylation of
vegf receptor. in addition, vegf-induced formation of tubelike structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse
corneas were significantly inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx . these findings
clearly demonstrate that  xxxd3284xxx  is a potential inhibitor of
angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular
endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful
therapeutic agent against mm.

introduction
multiple myeloma (mm) is a b-cell malignancy characterized by
the clonal proliferation of terminally differentiated plasma cells,
monoclonal gammaglobulinemia, immunodeficiency, renal
insufficiency and multiple bone lesions. 1,2 although high-dose
chemotherapy induces complete remission in a small fraction of
patients, long-term remission is rare. in addition, sufferers tend
to belong to older age groups, which can limit the use of
conventional chemotherapeutic agents due to complications. as
a result, there is an urgent need for novel treatment modalities
that are suitable even for high-risk patients.
the interaction between myeloma cells and bone marrow
microenvironment has a key role in the pathogenesis of mm.2,3
these involve the production of cytokines and growth factors
such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and insulin-like growth factor-1, as
well as physical interactions. il-6 strongly promotes the cellular
proliferation of myeloma cells, especially in the early stages of

tumorigenesis.3,4 myeloma cells produce several proangiogenic
factors, including vegf, fibroblast growth factor-2, angiopoietin-1, metalloproteinases and urokinase-type plasminogen
activator.5–7 bone marrow angiogenesis has an important role in
progression of mm: microvessel density and angiogenesis in the
bone marrow are correlated with the prognosis and survival of
mm patients.5–7 therefore, vegf and its cognate receptor are
both believed to be potential targets for antimyeloma treatment.
preclinical trials with vegf-neutralizing antibodies have reported inhibition of the production of metalloproteinases, tumor
necrosis factor-a and il-1b in solid tumors8 and myelomonocytic leukemia.9 moreover, vegf receptor ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ) tyrosine
kinase inhibitor has been shown to suppress the proliferation
and migration of myeloma cells expressing  xxxg800xxx  ( xxxg800xxx ).10 it
is currently under a phase ii study for the treatment of mm.11
thalidomide has been reported to inhibit the myeloma cell
growth through induction of apoptosis and blockade of the
interaction between myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal
cells (bmscs),2 in addition to the antiangiogenic activity
through inhibition on  xxxg787xxx  induced angiogenesis.12 thus, an
antiangiogenic therapeutic strategy might be useful for the
treatment of mm.
all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) and other retinoids have
been reported to inhibit the growth of a range of malignancies
both in vitro and in vivo, including acute promyelocytic
leukemia (apl), neuroblastoma, lung cancer and mm.13–18
atra induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptotic
cell death, and il-6/ xxxg1182xxx  downregulation in vitro.16–18
retinoids exert their effects through interactions with two types
of nuclear receptors,  xxxd3417xxx  receptor ( xxxg1931xxx ) and retinoid x
receptor (rxr), each of which has three subtypes (-a, -b and -g).
atra is one of the most clinically successful retinoids, however,
its high rates of adverse effects, instability, and the appearance
of atra-resistant leukemia cells have provided obstacles to
atra-based therapies.19 in an attempt to overcome these
problems,  xxxd3284xxx  has been synthesized by the introduction
of heteroatoms into atra-like structures (figure 1).20  xxxd3284xxx  is a
 xxxg1931xxx -a/b-selective retinoid, that does not bind and activate  xxxg1933xxx  and rxrs, hence can spare unfavorable adverse effects.  xxxd3284xxx 
has little affinity for cellular  xxxd3417xxx  binding protein
(crabp) and is active against crabp-rich atra-resistant
cells.21,22 in addition, it is more stable against light, heat and
oxidation than atra. tobita et al reported that 14 out of 24
(58%) apl patients who relapsed after atra treatment showed
complete remission by the treatment with  xxxd3284xxx  and experienced fewer adverse side effects in clinical trials.22 thus,  xxxd3284xxx 
has additional therapeutic advantages compared with atra.
furthermore,  xxxd3284xxx  has been shown to decrease il-1-induced
il-6 production in vitro,23 and inhibit angiogenesis in chicken
chorioallantoic membranes.24 however, there have been no
further reports on the mechanisms of this antiangiogenic
activity.

materials and methods

cell lines and culture

spotlight

the human myeloma cell lines, u266, amo1, ilkm-2, ilkm-3
and ilkm-8, used in this study, were described previously. 25,26
all cell lines were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), streptomycin, and penicillin.
recombinant human il-6 (diaclone research, besancon,
france) was added  xxxd1891xxx  ng/ml to the medium of ilkm-2,
ilkm-3 and ilkm-8. human umbilical vein vascular endothelial
cells (huvecs) were purchased from clonetics (walkers ville,
md, usa) and bmscs cells were from bio whittaker (md, usa)
through sanko junyaku (tokyo, japan), and were cultured
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. nih3t3/ xxxg1274xxx  and
nih3t3/ xxxg800xxx  cells, which were kindly provided by dr m
shibuya (university of tokyo, tokyo, japan), were cultured in
dmem supplemented with 10% fbs.

immunoblotting assay
nih3t3/ xxxg1274xxx  and nih3t3/ xxxg800xxx  cells were cultured in serumdepleted dmem for 48 h and then cells were preincubated with
 xxxd3284xxx  for 12 h or su541628–30 for 3 h followed by stimulation
with 30 ng/ml vegf for 5 min at 371c. after incubation, the cells
were washed with cold-pbs (phosphate-buffered saline) and
lysed in the buffer (50 mm hepes, 150 mm nacl, 1% triton
x-100, and 10% glycerol containing 1 mm pmsf, 10 mg/ml
aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm sodium vanadate). cell
lysates were subjected to sds-page and transferred to
immobilon membranes (millipore, ma, usa). after transfer,
membranes were incubated with the blocking solution and
probed with antiphosphotyrosine (py20), anti- xxxg1274xxx  or anti- xxxg800xxx 
antibody (santa cruz biotechnologies, ca, usa), antiphospho
 xxxg1369xxx /2 or anti- xxxg1369xxx /2, antiphospho akt or anti-akt antibody
(cell signaling, ma, usa) followed by washing. the protein
contents were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl, amersham/pharmacia biotech, nj, usa).

migration assay under coculture system
materials
 xxxd3284xxx  was kindly gifted by dr h kagechika (university of
tokyo, tokyo, japan).27 atra was purchased from sigma
(st louis, mo, usa). chemical structures of  xxxd3284xxx  and atra
are presented in figure 1. each retinoid was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide  xxxd1891xxx  mm. human recombinant  xxxg1608xxx  was
purchased from r&d systems (minneapolis, mn, usa).
the selective vegf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,
3-[(2,4-dimetylpyrrol-5-yl) methylidenyl]-iodolin-2-one ( xxxd3191xxx )
was provided by sugen28 and the taiho pharmaceutical
co. (tokyo, japan).

growth inhibition assay
the growth inhibitory effects of the retinoids for myeloma cell
lines were determined using a methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium
(mtt) assay. cells (2  l04/well) were cultured in 96-well plates
in triplicate with or without  xxxd3284xxx , in a final volume of 100 ml at
371c for 48 h. after incubation, 10 ml of 5 mg/ml mtt solution
(sigma) was added to each well, the cells were incubated for 4 h
at 371c, and 100 ml of lysis buffer (0.04 n hcl and isopropanol)
was added. the optical densities (ods) at 570 and 630 nm were
measured with a multiplate reader. cell growth (%) was
calculated as the following: (od630–od570 of the samples/
od630–od570 of the control)  100. for huvecs or bmscs,
2.5–3.0  104 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in triplicate
under a basal growth condition or serum starved condition for
24 h and incubated with or without vegf or  xxxd3284xxx  for another
48 h. then the cell number was counted by coulter counter.
leukemia

myeloma cells (1  105) were cultured at 371c in a final volume
of 1 ml in culture medium. we used the conditioned medium for
coculture migration assay after 48 h incubation and the
concentration of vegf was determined using commercially
available elisa kit (r&d systems).

to assay for migration of huvecs or bmscs under coculture
system, huvecs or stromal cells were plated in the inner
chambers after preincubation with or without  xxxd3284xxx  or atra for
12 h or  xxxd3191xxx  for 3 h, and followed cocultivation with
myeloma cells in the outer chambers (see figure 2b). huvecs
(3  105) or stromal cells (3  105) were suspended in medium
and seeded in the inner chamber with polycarbonate filters
(8 mm pores: kurabo inc., tokyo, japan) coated with human
plasma fibronectin (1.33 mg/ml: life technologies, inc., tokyo,
japan). after 6 h (huvecs) or 12 h (stromal cells) incubation at
371c, media in the inner chambers were aspirated, and cells on
the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton
swab. cells on the lower surface of the filters were fixed with
ethanol and stained with giemsa, and the stained nuclei were
counted. five fields (  100) per chamber were counted, and
average numbers were determined with three chambers.

in vitro tube-formation assay
the effect of  xxxd3284xxx  and atra on in vitro tube formation was
assessed based on the vegf-induced tube formation of huvecs
using an angiogenesis kit (kurabo industries ltd, tokyo, japan)
according to the manufacture’s instructions. briefly, cocultured
huvecs and fibroblasts were incubated with or without 10 ng/
ml vegf and serial dilutions of  xxxd3284xxx  or atra for 11 days. the
medium containing vegf and  xxxd3284xxx  or atra was changed
every 3 days. the wells were then fixed and immunostained
with  xxxg1724xxx , and the stained capillary structures in each well
were photographed and quantified.

cells for 6 h. after incubation, migrated cells were counted after giemsa staining.

mouse corneal micropocket assay and quantification
of corneal neovascularization
a mouse corneal micropocket assay was performed as described
previously.29,30.briefly, 0.3 ml of hydron pellets (ifn sciences,
nj, usa) containing vegf (200 ng/pellet) was implanted into
the corneas of male balb/c mice on day 1.  xxxd3284xxx  was
administered orally and  xxxd3191xxx  was administered intraperitoneally on days 0–6. all mice were killed on day 6 and their
corneal vessels were photographed. images of the corneas were
recorded using nikon coolscan software (nikon corp., tokyo,
japan) and corneal neovascularization was analyzed using the
nih image 1.61 software package.31

migration of vascular endothelial cells cocultured with
myeloma cells and inhibitory effect of  xxxd3284xxx 
we first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on
migration of huvecs. as shown in figure 2a, five myeloma cell
lines secreted varying amounts of vegf into the culture medium
during incubation for 48 h. we then examined if myeloma cells
could stimulate migration of huvecs under coculture assay
condition (figure 2b). the migration of huvecs to the lower
surface of the filters was assayed after incubation for further 6 h.
the results revealed that coculture with amo1 or ilkm-8,

which secreted large amounts of vegf, induced about a two to
three-fold increase in migration compared with the control in
the absence of myeloma cells (figure 2c). when cocultured with
u266, ilkm-2 or ilkm-3, which produced less amount of vegf
than amo1 or ilkm-8, migration of huvecs showed much less
increase. remarkable cell migration of huvecs was observed
by exogenous addition of vegf (20 ng/ml) in the outer chamber.
we then examined the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3284xxx , atra and
 xxxd3191xxx  on migration of huvecs when cocultured with amo1
or ilkm-8 cells. chemical structures of  xxxd3284xxx  and atra are
shown in figure 1. myeloma cell-induced migration of huvecs
was remarkably inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm (figure 2d and e).
atra also showed the inhibitory effect at the similar levels to
 xxxd3284xxx , and  xxxd3191xxx , a selective vegf receptor  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor, inhibited migration of huvecs at 5 mm completely.

growth inhibitory effect of  xxxd3284xxx  on myeloma cells
and huvecs
we then examined if  xxxd3284xxx  inhibited the growth of myeloma
cells and huvecs.  xxxd3284xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm showed a subtle inhibitory
effect on the basal growth of myeloma cells and huvecs
(figure 3a and b). mean of 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)
values of  xxxd3284xxx  were ranging from 20 to 30 mm. we also
examined the growth inhibitory effect of  xxxd3284xxx  on huvecs
under vegf-stimulated condition (figure 3c). exogenous addition of vegf stimulated cell growth more than 1.5-fold over the
control, and  xxxd3284xxx  significantly inhibited vegf-induced cellular growth of huvecs (ic50 values are 5 mm).

 xxxd3284xxx  inhibits migration of bmscs cocultured with
myeloma cells
in order to understand if  xxxd3284xxx  could modulate the microenvironment in multiple myeloma, we then examined the effect of
 xxxd3284xxx  on cell growth and migration of bmscs. as shown in
figure 4a,  xxxd3284xxx  up to 10 mm was found to show no inhibition
on cell growth of bmscs. coculture with ilkm-8 or amo1
stimulated migration of stromal cells two- to three-fold over the
control, and  xxxd3284xxx  inhibited myeloma cell-induced migration in
a dose-dependent manner (figure 4b).

 xxxd3284xxx  induces il-6/ xxxg1182xxx  downregulation and cell cycle
arrest in myeloma cell
we then examined the mechanism of the growth inhibitory
effects of  xxxd3284xxx  on myeloma cells (see supplementary information). the il-6 production from u266 cells was decreased by the
treatment of  xxxd3284xxx  in a dose-dependent manner, and  xxxg1182xxx 
expression on cell surface membrane of u266 and ilkm-2 cells
was also downregulated by  xxxd3284xxx  at 1 mm after 24 h. regarding
cell cycle progression, the number of cells at the g0/g1 phase
was slightly increased, and that at the s and g2/m phases was
reduced in both ilkm-2 and u266 cells after 24 h treatment with
 xxxd3284xxx  at 1 mm. we further examined the expression and
phosphorylation of cell cycle-related proteins using immunoblotting. the levels of phosphorylated rb markedly decreased
24 h after treatment with  xxxd3284xxx  at 1 mm, and a slight increase in
p21 levels was observed. apoptotic changes were not observed
(data not shown).

and incubated for 12 h. migrated cells were counted after giemsa

effect of  xxxd3284xxx  on vegf-induced autophosphorylation
of vegf receptors
in order to understand the inhibitory mechanism of  xxxd3284xxx  on
vegf-induced migration of huvecs, we examined if  xxxd3284xxx 
could modulate vegf-induced activation of two vegf receptor
molecules,  xxxg800xxx ( xxxg800xxx ) and  xxxg1274xxx ( xxxg1274xxx ). we could not
detect any apparent expressions of both vegfrs in huvecs by
immunoblotting, since the receptor numbers were very low. we
therefore used  xxxg800xxx  or  xxxg1274xxx  overexpressing nih3t3 cells. in
these cells, immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody
indicated that  xxxg800xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  were autophosphorylated in
response to vegf (figure 5a), consistent with our previous
report.30  xxxd3284xxx  significantly inhibited autophophorylation of
 xxxg800xxx  at 0.1 mm, while  xxxd3284xxx  inhibited that of  xxxg1274xxx  at
1 mm (figure 5a).  xxxd3191xxx  completely blocked autophosphorylation of both vegfrs at 5 mm. we also examined the effect
of  xxxd3284xxx  on the downstream signaling molecules of vegf
receptors, akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in huvecs. we could detect
apparent activation of akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in response to vegf
in huvecs (figure 5b). phosphorylation of akt was almost
completely inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm. however phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2, however, was not inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx  at
10 mm. by contrast,  xxxd3191xxx  at 5 mm almost completely
inhibited phosphorylation of both akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2. we
also examined the effect of  xxxd3284xxx  on vegf production by

figure 5

nih3t3/ xxxg800xxx  cells were grown to near confluence and then serum
depleted for 48 h. the cells were preincubated with indicated
concentrations of  xxxd3284xxx  for 12 h or  xxxd3191xxx  for 3 h, followed by the
addition of 30 ng/ml vegf for 5 min at 371c. protein extracts were
resolved by sds-page, and  xxxg800xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  were probed with
antiphosphotyrosine, anti- xxxg800xxx , or anti- xxxg1274xxx  antibody. (b) protein
extracts of huvecs were probed with antiphospho akt, anti-akt,
antiphospho  xxxg1369xxx /2 or anti- xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody (b).

myeloma cells, however,  xxxd3284xxx  did not affect vegf production
(data not shown).

effect of  xxxd3284xxx  on vegf-induced tube formation by
vascular endothelial cells
we then examined if  xxxd3284xxx  inhibited the formation of tube-like
structures in vitro in response to vegf using huvecs. as shown
in figure 6a, 10 ng/ml of vegf increased tube formation,
whereas it was significantly inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm.  xxxd3284xxx 
did not show any cytotoxic effects even at a dose of 10 mm in this
condition using confluent huvecs. quantitative analysis
demonstrated that the rate of tube formation was two-fold
higher in the presence of vegf, but was inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner (figure 6b).  xxxd3284xxx  at 0.1 or 1 mm
showed almost 40–50 or 50–60% inhibition, respectively. atra
also inhibited tube formation (figure 6c), but cytotoxic effect
was detected at a dose of 10 mm (data not shown).

discussion
in spite of a significant advancement in conventional chemotherapy and wider applicability of high-dose treatment with
transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, mm still remains
incurable. 1,2 it is recently reported that the interaction between
myeloma cells and bone marrow microenvironment have
crucial roles in the pathogenesis of mm,2 and acquired drug
resistance is also mediated by environmental factors.32 multiple
myeloma cells could stimulate angiogenesis through paracrine
control of vegf and other proangiogenic factors. therefore, we
examined the myeloma cell-dependent angiogenesis and
inhibitory effect of  xxxd3284xxx  in vitro and in vivo.
leukemia

myeloma cell lines produced various amounts of vegf,
and cell migration of huvecs was promoted by vegf or
coculture with myeloma cells (figure 2).  xxxd3284xxx  showed subtle
(for myeloma cells and huvecs) or little (for bmscs) inhibitory
effects on proliferation under basal condition (figures 3 and 4a).
however, vegf-induced proliferation of huvecs was significantly inhibited by  xxxd3284xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm (figure 3c). moreover,  xxxd3284xxx 
markedly inhibited migration of both huvecs (figure 2d and e)
and bmscs (figure 4b) when cocultured with myeloma cells.
 xxxd3284xxx  also blocked vegf-induced formation of tube-like
structures in vitro (figure 6) as well as neovascularization in
mice corneas without cytotoxic effect (figure 7). in addition,
 xxxd3284xxx  inhibited the phosphorylation of both  xxxg800xxx  and
 xxxg1274xxx  at similar levels as  xxxd3191xxx  (figure 5).  xxxd3284xxx  did not
affect vegf production by myeloma cells under the coculture
condition (data not shown). although further investigation about
the molecular mechanisms is necessary, these results demonstrated that  xxxd3284xxx  has an inhibitory effect on vegf- or
myeloma cell-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo
through downregulation of vegf/ xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  signaling. therefore,
 xxxd3284xxx  is a potent inhibitor of this signaling, which might be a
useful therapeutic agent against mm (figure 8).

were heavily pretreated and resistant to conventional chemotherapy (vasole et al, personal communication). none of the
patients achieved a complete or partial response (0%), one
patient experienced stable disease (9%) and 10 patients
were classified with progressive disease (91%). koskela et al33
also reported that atra alone is not effective to pretreated
mm patients. these results were not satisfactory, however, all
of the enrolled patients had heavily treated refractory myeloma,
suggesting that tumor cells had lost their dependence of
growth on il-6. in this study, we observed the subtle inhibitory
effect on myeloma cell growth through cell cycle arrest, as
well as downregulation of il-6/ xxxg1182xxx  (figure 3a and supplementary information). il-6/ xxxg1182xxx  signaling is much more
important for the proliferation of early stage mm than refractory
one.1 therefore, although both  xxxd3284xxx  and atra do not have
sufficient antitumor effect against cell lines or refractory mm, it
is not possible to conclude that all types of retinoids will be
ineffective against newly diagnosed or early stage mm.
furthermore, the pharmacological effects of retinoids are
strongly affected by their chemical stability and by drug
resistance in cancer cells. serum level of  xxxd3284xxx  was found to
be more stable in patients than atra (unpublished data), and
 xxxd3284xxx  is characterized by a low potential for drug resistance,
minimal adverse events and superior chemical stability. in highrisk patients, it is important that the risk of therapy-related
mortality does not exceed the potential advantages of a
treatment. since  xxxd3284xxx  appears to be the safe and practical
agent, it could be used as the chemopreventive agents in
combination with other chemotherapeutic or noncytotoxic
agents for the indolent and smoldering types of myeloma cells,
which do not necessarily need intensive chemotherapy and
maintains the sensitivity to il-6. in addition, it would be a
suitable agent especially for the initially diagnosed mm in
elderly, who cannot receive cytotoxic therapies. we have
examined the synergistic inhibitory effect of  xxxd3284xxx  on myeloma
cell in combination with dexamethasone, and confirmed that
 xxxd3284xxx  possessed an additive effect on dexamethasone (data not
shown).
our results clearly show that  xxxd3284xxx  has an inhibitory effect on
angiogenesis induced by the interaction between vascular

the scheme for inhibitory effects of  xxxd3284xxx  on myeloma cell-induced angiogenesis. multiple myeloma cells promote migration of
vascular endothelial cells and angiogenesis through paracrine control of vegf. bone marrow stromal cells produce il-6, which strongly stimulates
cellular growth of myeloma cells.  xxxd3284xxx  blocks myeloma cell-induced angiogenesis through inhibition of  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation. in addition,
 xxxd3284xxx  inhibits the expression of  xxxg1182xxx  on cell surface membrane of myeloma cells.

these findings,  xxxd3284xxx  could be a promising clinical agent
against mm.
