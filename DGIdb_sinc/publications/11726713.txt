serine palmitoyltransferase (spt; ec 2.3.1.50) catalyzes the condensation of serine with  xxxd2832xxx -coa to
form 3-ketosphinganine in the first step of de novo
sphingolipid biosynthesis. in this study, we describe the
cloning and functional characterization of a cdna from
arabidopsis thaliana encoding the  xxxg2195xxx  subunit of spt.
the arabidopsis  xxxg2195xxx  (atlcb2) cdna contains an open
reading frame of 1,467 nucleotides, encoding 489 amino
acids. the predicted polypeptide contains three transmembrane helices and a highly conserved motif involved in
 xxxd3047xxx  binding. expression of this open reading frame in the saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains
defective in spt activity resulted in the expression of a
significant level of  xxxd1890xxx , suggesting that atlcb2
cdna encodes spt. southern blot analysis and inspection
of the complete arabidopsis genome sequence database
suggest that there is a second  xxxg2195xxx -like gene in arabidopsis. expression of a green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion
product in suspension-cultured tobacco by-2 cells showed
that atlcb2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.
atlcb2 cdna may be used to study how sphingolipid
synthesis is regulated in higher plants.

introduction
sphingolipids are membrane components in eukaryotic
organisms and several bacteria. sphingolipid contains a hydro3

5

phobic segment (ceramide) that consists of a  xxxd3235xxx 
base (long-chain base, lcb) and a fatty acid. it has been
proposed that sphingolipid catabolites, e.g. sphingosine (trans4- xxxd3235xxx ), sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide, are
potential intra- and intercellular second messenger molecules
in yeast and mammalian cells (hannun 1996). in a plant pathogenesis study, fungal monoglucosylceramides, which contain a
c-9-methylated lcb, have an elicitor activity that induces
phytoalexins and the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins in rice leaves (umemura et al. 2000). furthermore, fungal
metabolites with structural similarity to sphingosine, the
fumonisins and alternaria toxins (aal toxins), act as toxins in
plants (gilchrist et al. 1992, abbas et al. 1993, nelson et al.
1993). fumonisin b1 also elicits an apoptosis-like programmed
cell death in arabidopsis protoplasts (wang et al. 1996, asai et
al. 2000). the mechanism of action of these phytotoxic compounds may involve the disruption of sphingolipid metabolism
via the inhibition of ceramide synthesis (abbas et al. 1994,
riley et al. 1993, wang et al. 1991). however, little is known
about the cellular mechanisms regulating the levels of sphingolipid molecules, and our understanding of de novo synthesis
of sphingolipids in plant cells remains limited.
biosynthesis of sphingolipids is initiated by a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (spt; ec 2.3.1.50) that condenses l-serine with  xxxd2832xxx -coa to form 3-ketosphinganine
(merrill and jones 1990, dickson and lester 1999) (fig. 1).
3-ketosphinganine is immediately converted to d-erythrosphinganine by an nadph-dependent 3-ketosphinganine
reductase (d- xxxd2033xxx - xxxd1890xxx :nadp+ 3-oxidoreductase, ec
1.1.1.102). several lines of evidence suggest that spt is a ratelimiting enzyme in the sphingolipid synthetic pathway, and is
therefore recognized as a key enzyme for regulating cellular
sphingolipid content in mammalian tissues and cultured cell
lines (merrill and jones 1990). lynch and fairfield (1993) first
demonstrated in plant tissues that spt activity in squash
(cucurbita pepo l.) pericarps exhibits a high degree of specificity for  xxxd2832xxx -coa in a pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate-dependent
reaction and that enzyme activity is found in the membrane
fraction, specifically in the endoplasmic reticulum (er). therefore, the catalytic mechanism and subcellular localization of
spt may be conserved among various organisms including animals, fungi and plants.

serine palmitoyltransferase in arabidopsis

here we describe the isolation and characterization of an
arabidopsis cdna homologous to s. cerevisiae  xxxg2195xxx . the
gene corresponding to this cdna clone was designated
atlcb2. to our knowledge, this is the first achievement of
cdna cloning and characterization of enzymes involved in the
synthesis of sphingolipids in plants. we also examined the
intracellular localization of a fusion protein between the synthetic green fluorescent protein (sgfp; s56t) and atlcb2
protein in suspension-cultured cells of tobacco, and demonstrate that atlcb2 protein is localized on the er. some of the
present work has been reported previously in preliminary form
(tamura et al. 2000).

the pathway for the synthesis of sphingolipid long-chain

although the structure and metabolism of lcb in plants
are essentially similar to those in other eukaryotes, little is
known about the regulation of de novo synthesis of sphingolipids in plants. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, two genes,
 xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx , that encode subunits of spt have been isolated by the complementation of mutant strains defective in
spt activity (buede et al. 1991, nagiec et al. 1994). zhao et al.
(1994) independently isolated the scs1/ xxxg2195xxx  gene, as one of
suppressor genes of the ca2+-sensitive growth phenotype of
cgs2 mutant cells. this suggests that sphingolipid metabolism
in s. cerevisiae is related to ca2+ homeostasis. recently, a
tsc3 gene that suppresses a high-temperature-sensitive lethal
phenotype of cgs2 mutants was identified (gable et al. 2000).
tsc3 protein is a membrane-associated protein that stimulates
spt activity through association with  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  proteins. mammalian cdna homologs of both  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx 
have also been identified and functionally characterized (nagiec et al. 1996, hanada et al. 1997, weiss and stoffel 1997).
hanada et al. (2000) expressed the hamster  xxxg2194xxx  protein in a
chinese hamster ovary cell mutant strain lacking endogenous
 xxxg2194xxx , and purified spt from the cells. endogenous  xxxg2195xxx 
protein was co-purified with tagged  xxxg2194xxx  protein, suggesting
that the  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  proteins may function as an enzyme
complex in vivo in mammalian cells. ikushiro et al. (2001)
reported that spt from a gram-negative obligatory aerobic
bacterium sphingomonus paucimobilis is a water-solubule
enzyme, suggesting that cellular localization of sphingomonus
spt is distinct from that of eukatyotic spt.

pcr cloning and characterization of atlcb2
a tblastn (altschul et al. 1990) search in the est
database of arabidopsis cdna at the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) for sequences homologous to
the  xxxg2195xxx  subunit of s. cerevisiae spt (nagiec et al. 1994)
retrieved an arabidopsis est clone (accession no. c99820)
that was significantly similar to the c-terminal domain of the s.
cerevisiae  xxxg2195xxx . accordingly, the gene corresponding to this
clone was designated atlcb2. however, this est clone missed
1,100-bp of the 5¢ half of the orf sequence. therefore, we
amplified the 5¢-missing sequence by pcr as described in
materials and methods. eventually, the longest pcr product
(750 bp) was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence determined.
the longest atlcb2 cdna isolated was 1,973 bp long (accession no. ab046384), with an orf of 1,467 bp that encodes a
protein of 489 amino acid residues.
alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of different  xxxg2195xxx  proteins (thompson et al. 1994) shows that the
sequence from arabidopsis shares 51% and 44% identity with
those from human and s. cerevisiae, respectively (fig. 2). the
predicted atlcb2 protein has a molecular mass of 54,288 da,
and an isoelectric point (pi) of 8.84. homology studies also
suggest that the atlcb2 gene can be assigned to arabidopsis
chromosome 5 (accession no. ab025633) and has 11 (putative) introns, the sequences of which contain consensus gt and
ag dinucleotides at the 5¢ and 3¢ splice sites, respectively
(hanley and schuler 1988). we also found that the atlcb2
protein contains a highly conserved motif, 307gtftksfg314
(fig. 2), that is involved in  xxxd3047xxx  binding.
to evaluate the complexity of atlcb2-related genes in the
arabidopsis genome, we performed southern blot hybridization of arabidopsis genomic dna using atlcb2 cdna as a
probe. dna digestion with bamhi, ecorv, and kpni resulted
in the identification of unique dna fragments between 6.6 and
23.1 kb in size that hybridized with atlcb2 cdna (fig. 3).
digestion with ecorv and kpni revealed two fragments. there
are no bamhi, ecorv, or kpni sites in either the introns or
exons of the atlcb2 sequence. this indicates that at least two

(hslcb2), and s. cerevisiae (sclcb2) were compared using the clustal w program. identical amino acid residues in the three proteins are
highlighted, and similar residues are shaded. the putative motif for a pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate-binding site (gtftksfg) is underlined, and an
asterisk indicates the lysine residue that forms a schiff base with pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate.

fig. 3 genomic dna gel-blot analysis of the atlcb2 gene.
genomic dna (10 mg per lane) from arabidopsis leaves was digested
with bamhi, ecorv, or kpni, separated electrophoretically on agarose gel, blotted, and probed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled atlcb2
cdna according to the instructions of the alkphos direct labelling
and detection system with cdp-star (amersham pharmacia biotech). dna marker sizes are indicated on the left (in kbp).

dna regions with high homology to the atlcb2 gene exist in
the arabidopsis genome. consistent with this, there is a
sequence on chromosome 3 of the arabidopsis genome with
the potential to encode a protein with 89% identity and 93%
similarity to atlcb2 (accession no. cab87906). this may be
particularly noteworthy because the other  xxxg2195xxx  genes cloned
so far are reported to be single-copy genes.
to examine the organ-specific expression of the atlcb2
gene, rt-pcr/southern hybridization analysis was undertaken
using total rna prepared from leaves, stems, roots, flowers,
and mature seeds of arabidopsis. transcripts were detected in
equal amounts in leaves, stems, roots, and flowers, but at lower
levels in mature seeds (fig. 4). as a control, the level of
expression of the  xxxg1960xxx  gene (lippuner et al. 1994) was also
examined using the same rna samples. a 628-bp fragment,
corresponding to  xxxg1960xxx  cdna, was amplified at similar levels
in all organs tested.

which carries the orf of atlcb2 cdna under the control of
the gal1 promoter. under similar conditions, the pyes2sclcb2 plasmid, a control plasmid that expresses the s. cerevisiae  xxxg2195xxx  gene, complemented the lcb– phenotype. therefore, to prove that cloned atlcb2 cdna encodes a component of spt, in vitro spt activity was measured with
membrane fractions from s. cerevisiae lcj201 cells transformed either with pye-atlcb2 or with vector alone, using l[14c]serine with  xxxd2832xxx -coa as substrates. as shown in
table 1, lcj201 cells transformed with pye-atlcb2 exhibited about 20-fold more spt activity than did lcj201 cells or
vector-transformed lcj201 cells. these low levels of activity
constitute the limits of detection. these data clearly demonstrate that recombinant atlcb2 protein itself has spt activity.
by contrast, by4743, a parental strain of lcj201, exhibited an
enzyme activity of 149 pmol min–1 (mg protein)–1, suggesting
that the level of spt activity of atlcb2-transformed lcj201
cells was too low to rescue the  xxxg2195xxx  defect of the lcj201
mutant strain (discussed below).
when a protein blot was probed with mouse antiserum
against the 13.3-kda hydrophilic domain (ala45 to gly160) of
the atlcb2 protein, a 54-kda polypeptide was detected in the
microsomal fraction of the lcj201 cells carrying pyeatlcb2 (fig. 5). this result indicates that the expressed

lcj201 strain. cell-free extracts prepared from lcj201 cells containing the vectors pyes2 or pye-atlcb2 and by4743 cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation. both the cytosolic (su) and
microsomal (pe) proteins (50 mg) were applied to sds-page, blotted
onto a pvdf membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting using
antiserum against the 13.3-kda hydrophilic domain (ala45 to gly160) of
the atlcb2 protein.

atlcb2 protein is localized in the membrane fraction, which is
similar to the site of expression of native  xxxg2195xxx  protein in s.
cerevisiae (gable et al. 2000).

analysis of the atlcb2 with a kyte and doolite hydrophobicity plot and a transmembrane (tm) prediction algorithm
(http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/tmprad_form.html) suggested that the atlcb2 protein contains three transmembrane
helices. the distribution of spt activity among subcellular
fractions has been characterized in mouse liver (mandon et al.
1992) and squash pericarps (lynch and fairfield 1993) using
differential centrifugation and marker enzymes, indicating that
spt activity is localized to the er. therefore, to examine
whether atlcb2 protein is localized to the er, tobacco by-2
cells were transformed with a chimeric gene encoding a fusion

between the synthetic green fluorescent protein (sgfp; s56t)
and atlcb2 protein. as shown in fig. 6c, the resultant transformant designated sgfp-atlcb2/by2 showed fluorescence
in the er network and nuclear envelope, which is similar to
our previous study with a fusion protein including an er-retention signal, hdel (mitsuhashi et al. 2000). these results suggest that atlcb2 may be localized to the er in by-2 cells, and
probably in arabidopsis cells. immunoblots of the extracts of
these cells with gfp-specific or atlcb2-specific antibodies
showed that an 82-kda protein accumulated in the transformed
cells (fig. 6b). the molecular mass of 82 kda is consistent
with the calculated mass of 81,286 da for sgfp-atlcb2.

discussion
the arabidopsis  xxxg2195xxx  protein contains a unique
sequence, 307gtftksfg314, which is related to a pyridoxal
phosphate-binding motif that is commonly found in members
of the a-oxoamine synthase subfamily, such as 2-amino-3ketobutyrate coa ligase (mukherjee and dekker 1990) and 8amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (alexeev et al. 1998). the
lysine residue underlined has been shown to form a schiff base
with  xxxd3047xxx  (mukherjee and dekker 1990). the

gtftksfg motif is completely conserved among the predicted  xxxg2195xxx  proteins from arabidopsis, human, and s. cerevisiae, suggesting that these  xxxg2195xxx  polypeptides constitute catalytic subunits of spt. the arabidopsis protein is estimated to
be about 9 kda smaller than those of human and s. cerevisiae
(fig. 2). while the reason why atlcb2 does not have a similar n-terminal sequence is unclear, the extra n-terminal
domain in the human and s. cerevisiae  xxxg2195xxx  proteins is not
involved in protein targeting.
in the present study, the full-length atlcb2 cdna did not
complement the lcb– phenotype of lcj201. this is consistent
with the results of other workers who found that human  xxxg2195xxx 
cdna did not complement the lcb– phenotype of a s. cerevisiae lcb2d strain (nagiec et al. 1996). however, as shown in
table 1, membrane fractions of s. cerevisiae lcj201 cells
expressing the atlcb2 had spt activity. therefore, it is not
known exactly why atlcb2 was unable to complement the
lcb– phenotype of lcj201 cells. because the level of expression is not high, it is possible that the amount of enzyme is not
sufficient to synthesize enough amounts of  xxxd1890xxx  to rescue the lcb– phenotype. nagiec et al. (1996) suggested that
lack of complementation does not rule out functional homology, and in this context lack of complementation may be attributable to a lack of interaction between atlcb2 and the s. cerevisiae  xxxg2194xxx  subunit of spt, a failure of the protein to localize
to the er, or the metabolic instability of the chimeric protein.
in higher plants, monoglucosylceramides have been
idenetified as a major lipid component of the plasma membrane and tonoplast (yoshida and uemura 1986, cahoon and
lynch 1991, norberg et al. 1991). we recently reported that
major components of lcbs in arabidopsis monoglucosylceramides are 8-unsaturated-4-hydroxy-sphingenines (imai et al.
2000). although it has been speculated that these glycosphingolipids might play important physiological roles in plants in
addition to structural roles in those membranes (ohnishi et al.
1988, kasamo et al. 2000), even the mechanisms of monoglucosylceramide synthesis are not well understood. recently,
genes were identified in plants for a sphingolipid hydroxylase
that catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxylated lcbs (sperling
et al. 2001), which should be valuable in establishing the role
of these lipids in plants.
in summary, we have cloned and characterized the first
plant spt. sequence analysis reveals that arabidopsis spt is a
member of the a-oxoamine synthase subfamily. the cloning of
a plant spt cdna and the identification of its gene will contribute significantly to clarifying how the regulation of spt
influences sphingolipid synthesis in plant cells.

seeds of arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype columbia) were surfacesterilized in 2% (w/v) naclo and 0.02% (w/v) tween 20, then rinsed
five times with sterile, distilled water. sterile seeds were placed in

(wako pure chemicals, osaka, japan), 2% (w/v) sucrose, 3 mg ml–1
thiamine-hcl, 0.5 mg ml–1 pyridoxine, 5 mg ml–1  xxxd2715xxx , and
0.2% (w/v) gellan gum (wako pure chemicals) under 16 h light/8 h
dark fluorescent illumination at 23°c.
suspension-cultured cells of tobacco by-2 (nicotiana tabacum
l. cv. bright yellow 2) were subcultured in linsmaier-skoog medium
once a week at 26.5°c in the dark with a rotary shaker (multi shaker
mms-300, eyela, tokyo, japan) (mitsuhashi et al. 2000).
isolation of an arabidopsis  xxxg2195xxx  cdna
a blast search (altschul et al. 1990) of arabidopsis sequence
databases, using the sequence of the s. cerevisiae  xxxg2195xxx  protein, identified an expressed sequence tag (est) clone (accession no. c99820)
that contained a partial cdna sequence for a putative arabidopsis
 xxxg2195xxx  proteins. to isolate cdna containing a full-length open reading frame (orf), the 5¢-end was isolated by pcr, using taq dna
polymerase (ex taq, takara, shiga, japan) and a lgt11 cdna library
prepared from the roots and leaves of arabidopsis, as template. an initial pcr was performed with the first gene-specific primer a1 (5¢tttgattccgctaaggtcac-3¢), and the lgt11-specific primer
lg1 (5¢-ggtggcgacgactcctggagcccg-3¢). the pcr products were used as templates for nested pcr, using the second genespecific primer a1n (5¢-cttgaatgagatgcggagat-3¢), and
lg1. the third gene-specific primer a2 (5¢-ttatcaaccctccctttccaatcaa-3¢) was designed from the sequence of the amplified
pcr fragment, then the 5¢-coding region was amplified using the
primers a2 and lg1. amplified pcr fragments were subcloned into a
pbluescript ii (ks+) vector (stratagene, la jolla, ca), and sequenced
using an alf dna sequencer (amersham pharmacia biotech, uppsala, sweden) and the bcabest dideoxy sequencing kit (takara).
genome blot analysis
genomic dna was extracted from leaves with a dneasy plant
mini kit (qiagen). the genomic dna was digested with bamhi,
ecorv, or kpni, separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% (w/v) agarose
gel, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (genescreen plus, nen life science products, ma) by capillary blotting. a
1.5-kb fragment containing atlcb2 cdna was amplified by pcr
using the primers a3 (5¢-cgggatcccggatgataacgattccttatttaaccgctg-3¢) and a4 (5¢-cccaagcttggggcgttttcctggatgcatctctattt-3¢) and used as a hybridization probe.
the probe was labeled with alkaline phosphatase according to the
instructions of the alkphos direct labelling and detection system
with cdp-star (amersham pharmacia biotech). the membrane was
hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
the hybridization signals were detected with a typhoon 8600r imaging analyzer (amersham pharmacia biotech).
rt-pcr/southern hybridization analysis
rnas were isolated from leaves, stems, roots, and flowers of 4week-old arabidopsis plants and from mature seeds, using an rneasy
plant kit (qiagen). rt-pcr analysis of atlcb2 transcripts was carried out with superscript one-step system (invitrogen life technologies, carlsbad, ca). a 256-bp fragment of the 3¢-untranslated region
of atlcb2 was amplified with the primer 5¢-gcagaagatgggatttgagg-3¢ (forward) and the reverse primer a1 under 20
cycles of primer-annealing at 60°c. pcr products were separated on
1.5% (w/v) agarose gel and blotted onto nylon membrane. a 1.5-kb
fragment containing atlcb2 cdna was amplified by pcr using the
primers a3 and a4 and used as a hybridization probe. the probe was
labeled with horseradish peroxidase according to the instructions of
the ecl direct labelling and detection system (amersham pharma-

1279

cia biotech). the hybridization signals were detected by exposing the
membrane to film (x-u, fuji photo film, tokyo, japan). as a positive
control, a  xxxg1960xxx  gene for the cytosolic form of  xxxg798xxx  (lippuner
et al. 1994) was amplified, using primers 5¢-acttcgacatgaccatcgac-3¢ and 5¢-ttcccatgagaacacacacc-3¢.
construction of a  xxxg2195xxx -defective strain of s. cerevisiae
an s. cerevisiae strain carrying an lcb2d::leu2 deletion was
constructed according to the method of baudin et al. (1993). dna
fragments of  xxxg2195xxx  were amplified from the genomic dna of s. cerevisiae by pcr, using the following combinations of primers: a 5¢ xxxg2195xxx  fragment using primers 5¢-cccaagcttggggccgaagagacaccaaaatg-3¢ and 5¢-aactgcagaaccaatgcattggaatgaaacttacgggcactg-3¢ and a 3¢- xxxg2195xxx  fragment using
primers 5¢-cgggatcccgtgaaatcaaattccggcaaatc-3¢ and
5¢-gactagtctgcgaatatgatacgataaagttg-3¢. the 5¢- and
3¢- xxxg2195xxx  fragments were subcloned into the hindiii–psti sites, and
into the bamhi–spei sites, of pbluescript ii (ks+), respectively, and
the resulting plasmid was designated pbs-lcb2d. a psti–bamhi fragment of the leu2 gene from pjj283 (jones and prakash 1990) was
ligated into the psti–bamhi sites of pbs-lcb2d. hindiii–spei digestion of the resultant plasmid produced the lcb2d::leu2 cassette. an s.
cerevisiae lcb2d deletion strain (mat a/a, lcb2d::kanmax4, leu2d0/
leu2d0, his3d1/his3d1, ura3d0/ura3d0) (research genetics/invitrogen, ma, u.s.a.), which was derived from the wild-type strain
by4743 (mat a/a, leu2d0/leu2d0, his3d1/his3d1, ura3d0/ura3d0)
(wach et al. 1994), was transformed with the lcb2d::leu2 cassette
to produce a diploid version of an  xxxg2195xxx -null mutant strain with
selection for leu+ transformants, designated lcj201 (mat a/a,
 xxxg2195xxx ,::kanmax4,  xxxg2195xxx ,::leu2, his3,1/his3,1, ura3,0/ura3,0). strain
lcj201 was grown at 30°c in ypd medium (1% yeast extract, 2%
peptone, 2% glucose; difco, u.s.a.) containing 200 mg ml–1  xxxd2191xxx 
(sigma-aldrich) and 25 mm phytosphingosine (4-hydroxysphinganine)
(sigma-aldrich).
expression of atlcb2 protein in an  xxxg2195xxx -defective strain of s.
cerevisiae
the orf of atlcb2 cdna was amplified by pcr using primers a5 (5¢-cgggatcccgaaaatgataacgattccttatttaaccgctg-3¢) and a6 (5¢-ggaattccgcgttttcctggatgcatctctatttc-3¢). the amplified fragment was subcloned into the
bamhi–ecori sites of the s. cerevisiae–e. coli shuttle vector pyes2
(invitrogen, ca, u.s.a.). the resultant plasmid designated pyeatlcb2 expresses atlcb2 under the control of the galactosedependent gal1 promoter. pye-atlcb2, and pyes2 as a control,
were introduced into the lcj201 strain using a lithium acetate method
(gietz et al. 1995). transformed cells were grown overnight at 28°c in
minimal medium (1´ difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids,
20 mg ml–1  xxxd2282xxx , 200 mg ml–1  xxxd2191xxx , and 25 mm phytosphingosine) with 2% (w/v) glucose. overnight cultures were centrifuged and the cell pellets resuspended in minimal medium containing
2% (w/v) galactose. samples were incubated overnight at 28°c. the
galactose-induced s. cerevisiae cells were collected by centrifugation,
suspended in 100 mm hepes-koh (ph 8.0), 2.5 mm edta, 5 mm
dithiothreitol (dtt), 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), and vortexed with glass beads. the
homogenate was fractionated by centrifugation at 5,000´g for 10 min
and then at 105,000´g for 1 h.
assay for spt activity
spt assays were based on the method of williams et al. (1984).
reactions were carried out in a 0.1 ml volume containing 100 mm
hepes-koh (ph 8.0), 2.5 mm edta, 5 mm dtt, 50 mm pyridoxal

serine palmitoyltransferase in arabidopsis

5¢-phosphate, 0.2 mm  xxxd2832xxx -coa, 2 mm l-[u-14c]serine (5 mci
mmol–1), and 50–200 mg of protein. after incubation at 30°c for
20 min with gentle shaking, the reaction was terminated with 200 ml
0.5 m nh4oh, then 30 ml 10 mg ml–1 nabh4 was added (lynch and
fairfield 1993). the radiolabeled products were extracted by adding
1.5 ml chloroform-methanol (1 : 2, v/v), 1 ml chloroform, 0.5 ml
0.5 m nh4oh, and 20 mg  xxxd1890xxx . after brief centrifugation, the
lower organic phase was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography
(tlc) (silica gel 60, merck, germany) with a solvent of chloroform/
methanol/2 m nh4oh (80 : 30 : 4, by volume). the radioactive spots
corresponding to authentic  xxxd1890xxx  (sigma-aldrich) were identified and quantified using a bio-imaging analyzer (bas2000, fuji
photo film). the radioactivity of tlc scrapings was also counted on a
liquid scintillation counter (lsc-5100, aloka, tokyo) using a scintisol (scintiblender i, nacalai tesque, kyoto).
antibody preparation
the atlcb2 cdna fragment encoding a 13.3-kda putative
hydrophilic region (ala45 to gly160) was amplified by pcr using primers a7 (5¢-ggggtacccccgcgccgatctgtttggggcatga-3¢)
and a8 (5¢-cccaagcttgggtcccacaaacctagtaacacattcctca-3¢). the amplified fragment was subcloned into the kpni–
hindiii sites of the e. coli expression vector, pqe-40 (qiagen). this
plasmid, designated pqe-alcb202, was introduced into e. coli strain
m15 cells harboring prep4. a 41-kda polypeptide expressed in e.
coli was electroeluted and subjected to antiserum preparation in mice.
construction of synthetic green fluorescent protein expression
plasmids, transformation of tobacco by-2 cells, and fluorescence
microscopy
the plasmid puc-sgfp(s65t), which contains the cauliflower
mosaic virus (camv) 35s promoter, the sequence coding synthetic
green fluorescent protein [sgfp(s65t)], and the nopaline synthase
terminator ( xxxg1579xxx ¢) in the multiple cloning site of puc18 was generous
gift from dr. y. niwa of the university of shizuoka (chiu et al. 1996).
the orf of atlcb2 cdna was amplified by pcr using pyeatlcb2 as template with the primers 5¢-tgtacaaaatgataacgattccttatttaaccgctg-3¢ and 5¢-ggggagggcgtgaatgta-3¢. the pcr product was subcloned into the bsrgi–noti sites
of puc-sgfp(s65t). this plasmid, designated puc-sglcb2, was
digested with bamhi and ecori, and ligated into the bamhi–ecori
sites of pbi121. this plasmid, designated pbi-sglcb2, was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain gv3101) by electroporation using a gene-pulse apparatus (biorad laboratories, ca,
u.s.a.). by-2 cells were transformed with the chimeric gene
encoding sgfp-atlcb2 via a. tumefaciens according to the method
of matsuoka and nakamura (1991). the transformed by-2 cells were
inspected with a fluorescence microscope (axiophot 2, carl zeiss,
jena, germany) according to the method of mitsuhashi et al. (2000).
immunoblotting
sample solutions from s. cerevisiae by4743 cells or galactoseinduced s. cerevisiae lcj201 cells transformed with pye-atlcb2 or
pyes2 were separated by sds-page (laemmli 1970) and blotted
onto immun-blot pvdf membrane (bio-rad laboratories). the
membrane was incubated with specific antiserum (diluted 1 : 500)
against the 41-kda polypeptide of atlcb2 protein. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1 : 10,000) raised in goat against mouse
igg (chemicon international) were used as secondary antibodies.
by-2 cells transformed with the chimeric gene encoding sgfpatlcb2 were immunoblotted with antibodies against gfp (1 : 100;
living colors™ peptide antibody, clontech), or with specific antiserum (1 : 1,000) against the 41-kda polypeptide of atlcb2 protein.

horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1 : 5,000) raised in
goat against rabbit igg (biorad laboratories) were used as secondary
antibodies for gfp detection. ecl plus western detection reagents
(amersham pharmacia biotech) were used for immunodetection.
