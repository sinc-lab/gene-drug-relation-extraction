abstract: quinones represent a very important class of compounds found in nature and for the chemically synthesized drugs. the present study was designed to elucidate the intestinal first pass metabolic pathways in vivo and in vitro,
of tanshinone iia (ts), a derivative of phenanthrene-quinone isolated from salvia miltiorrhiza. five metabolites, proposed to be ts catechol glucuronides (two position isomers), dehydrotanshinone iia and its two catechol glucuronides,
were identified from the rat intestinal homogenates after oral administration of ts. ts metabolism was further conducted
in the subcellular system including cytosol, microsomes, mitochondrial and s9 under both phase i and phase ii metabolic
conditions. ts underwent negligible metabolism in all of the subcellular systems under phase i metabolic condition using
nadph as the cofactor. however, significant and substantial metabolic elimination of ts was observed in the cytosol
and s9 fractions, while not in the microsomes fractions, when both nadph and udpga were added. two ts catechol
glucuronides were identified from such an in vitro metabolic medium.  xxxd1875xxx , a specific inhibitor of the nad(p)h
dependent  xxxg521xxx  ( xxxg1592xxx ), significantly inhibited the metabolic elimination of ts in a noncompetitive
way, suggesting that  xxxg1592xxx  was responsible for the quinone reduction of ts to form the catechol intermediate. the
catechol intermediate failed to be detected directly was proved to be highly unstable and autoxidized back to ts accompanied with  xxxd2298xxx  generation.  xxxd1875xxx  exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the  xxxd2298xxx 
generation, further supporting that the reduction of ts was catalyzed by  xxxg1592xxx . the absolute bioavailability of ts was
significantly enhanced by oral  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment. in conclusion, a novel intestinal metabolic pathway for quinones,
 xxxg1592xxx  mediated reduction and subsequent glucuronidation, was determined using ts as a model compound. this study
should be helpful for the general understanding of quinones absorption and intestinal first pass metabolism.

key words: intestinal first pass metabolism, tanshinone iia, quinines,  xxxg1592xxx , glucuronidation.
1. introduction
first pass metabolism exerts a significant effect on the
oral bioavailability of many drugs. as for the orally administered xenobiotics, the first pass metabolism may occur in the
gastrointestinal tract or liver. except for the hydrolysis and
bacterium catalyzed metabolism occurred in the gastrointestinal tract, the predominant first pass metabolic pathway of
xenobiotics was catalyzed by the drug metabolizing enzymes
expressed in the enterocytes or hepatocytes. although it has
been widely believed that liver is the major site for first pass
metabolism due to its large size and the high content of drug
metabolizing enzymes, recent clinical studies indicated that
the small intestine contributes substantially to the overall
first pass metabolism of cyclosporine, nifedipine, midazolam, verapamil, and other drugs [1,2].
quinones represent a very important class of compounds
found in nature and for the chemically synthesized therapeutic drugs. the physiological, pharmacological and toxicological significance of quinones had thus attracted a great
attention from researchers worldwide [3]. in contrast, the
current understanding of their intestinal absorption and the

potential first pass metabolism is still rather poor. many
physiologically or pharmacologically important quinones
such as co-enzyme q [4],  xxxd3522xxx  [5],  xxxd320xxx  [5,6]
and idebenone [7] were found to possess a poor absorption
and low bioavailability. although the low aqueous solubility
has been claimed to be the main cause of their low bioavailability, potential intestinal and hepatic first pass metabolism
can not be excluded.
tanshinone ii a (ts) was a derivative of phenanthrenequinone isolated from salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen, in chinese), a widely used chinese herbal medicine. it had been
confirmed to possess a wide pharmacological activities including antioxidant [8], prevention of angina pectoris and
myocardial infarction [9], anticancer [10-12], inhibition of
osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption [13], and protection against brain damage caused by ischemia perfusion
[14], or by ischemia-hypoxia [15], in the previous decades.
in spite of a large body of literature on ts pharmacological activities, rather little is known about its pharmacokinetics, disposition characteristics and underlying mechanisms.
recently, we have made an in-depth research into its pharmacokinetic profile, absolute bioavailability, tissue distribution, plasma protein binding and its permeability through the
caco-2 cellular monolayer [16]. it has been found that the
absolute bioavailability of ts was extremely low (<3.5%)
even when it was administered as a solid dispersion prepared

in peg 6000. originally, we presumed that its extremely
poor solubility in water was the predominant cause for its
low bioavailability. however, it was argued that if the poor
aqueous solubility was the predominant cause, the preparation of a solid dispersion formation might be a practical and
promising strategy for improving the absorption [17,18]. the
failure of ts solid dispersion on getting a great bioavailability enhancement hinted to other masked attributions to the
low bioavailability of ts. furthermore, we observed in a
recent experiment that only 28.5% of the ts dose was recovered from the total gastrointestinal tract and feces 12 h
after an intragastric dose to rats, suggesting that significant
first pass metabolism has occurred. using a method of four
dosing routes to differentiate the first pass metabolism site,
we observed that intestine was the predominant site of the
first pass metabolism, accounting for 67% loss of the oral
dose, while ts underwent negligible first pass metabolism in
the stomach and liver.
based on the important preliminary findings, the present
study was further designed to elucidate the underlying metabolic pathways and involved enzymes responsible for the
substantial intestinal first pass metabolism of ts. the potential metabolites of ts in the gastrointestinal tract were firstly
identified 6 h after an oral dose of ts solid dispersion. furthermore, a new hypothesis of nad(p)h dependent quinone
oxidoreductase ( xxxg1592xxx ) mediated quinone reduction and
subsequent glucuronidation was brought forward based on
the information of metabolites identification in vivo. this
hypothesis was finally confirmed by using various subcellular in vitro metabolic systems including mitochondrial, cytosol, microsomes and s9 fractions incubated in phase i, phase
ii and combined phase i and ii conditions.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and reagents
authentic standards of ts, dehydrotanshinone iia, diazepam and 1,8- xxxd2657xxx  were purchased
from the national institute for the control of pharmaceutical
and biological products (beijing, china). the purity of all
standards was exceeding 99%. ts solid dispersion prepared
with peg 6000 was kindly provided by prof. hou-wei luo
(department of phytochemistry, china pharmaceutical university).  xxxd1292xxx , - xxxd3210xxx  (nadp), -nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad),  xxxd1292xxx  dehydrogenase, uridine
5’-diphosphate-glucuronic acid (sodium salt), d-saccharic
acid 1,4-lactone (saccharonolactone), -glucuronidase (escherichia coli) and alamethicin were all purchased from
sigma chemical (st. louis, mo, usa). phenol red and
horseradish peroxidase (hrp) were purchased from nanjing
shengxing biotechnology company (nanjing, china).
hplc grade acetonitrile was obtained from fisher scientific
(toronto, canada). deionized water was purified using a
milli-q system (millipore, milford, ma, usa). magnesium
chloride and other chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade.
2.2. animals
sprague–dawley rats (180–250g) were obtained from
sino-british sippr/bk lab animal ltd. (shanghai, china)

hao et al.

and housed with free access to food and water. the animals
were maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle (light on from
8:00 to 20:00) at ambient temperature (22–24 c) and ca.
60% relative humidity. the rats were fasted for 12 h before
all experimental studies. all animal work was approved by
the animal care and use committee of the college of
pharmacy, china pharmaceutical university.
2.3. differentiation of hepatic and gastrointestinal first
pass metabolism
to differentiate the hepatic and gastrointestinal first pass
metabolism of ts, a method of four dosing routes including
intravenous (iv), intraportal (ipv), intragastric (ig) and intraduodenal (id) administration was adopted according to the
previous report [19]. briefly, rats were intravenously or intraportally infused with ts solid dispersion at a dose of 2
mg/kg, while for the intragastric and intraduodenal administration, the dose was set at 20 mg/kg. blood (about 0.25
ml) was collected from the carotid artery into the heparinized tubes at predose and at 15, 30 (the infusing time was
about 30 min), 35, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480 min and
720 min postdose. the rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment and the total gastrointestinal tract including its contents was removed for determining the original ts remained.
2.4. metabolites identification in gi tract
rats were intragastrically administered with ts solid
dispersion at a dose of 20 mg/kg. six hours later, the rats
were euthanized by cervical dislocation followed by removing the total gastrointestinal tract immediately. the total gastrointestinal tract including its contents was stored at -80  c
before analysis.
for sample extraction, the total gastrointestinal tract including its contents was excised into pieces and homogenized in five volumes of ultrapure water to make 20% tissue
homogenate. three volumes of acetonitrile were added into
200 l of the homogenate followed by centrifugation at
10000 g for 10 min to deposit protein. the obtained supernatant was transferred to the sample vials for lc-dad-ms
and lc-ms/ms analysis.
the lc-dad-ms analysis was performed using a shimazu lc-10ad hplc system consisting of two pumps,
autosampler, column oven and diode array detector, which
was coupled with a lc-ms 2010a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an esi interface (shimazu, japan).
the separation was performed on a shim-pack stainless-steel
column (c18, 5m, 150mm2.0mm i.d., shimadzu) protected by a security guard (phenomenex inc.). the mobile
phase consisted of acetonitrile (a) and water (b) which was
programmed with a linear gradient system from 20% a and
80% b to 80% a and 20% b over a 30 min period, held at
80% a for another 5 min and then returned to 20% a for
another 5 min of equilibration. the flow rate was set at 0.2
ml/min. the dad scanning wavelength was set from 200 to
500 nm. the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive
ion mode in the m/z range 200–800.
the lc-ms/ms analysis was performed using a
finnigan surveyor™ hplc and tsq quantum discovery
max system (thermo electron, san jose, ca, usa). the

identification of a novel intestinal first pass metabolic pathway

mobile phase and gradient programs were same as that described above for the lc-dad-ms analysis. spray voltage
was set at 4kv and capillary temperature was set at 350 c
nitrogen was used as sheath gas setting at 30105pa, and as
auxiliary gas setting at 0.5105pa. argon was used as collision gas and the cid collision energy was set at 25ev. the
mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode.
the full scan was performed over the range m/z 200-800.
the product ion scan was performed over the range m/z 100300 for the phase i metabolites and 150-480 for the phase ii
metabolites characterization. the neutral loss of glucuronic
acid (176) scan was further conducted to confirm the glucuronidation conjugates.
2.5. preparation of subcelluar fractions
small intestines from five male rats were rinsed with 10
mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, containing 0.5% nacl (phosphate-buffered saline). the intestinal contents from the
cecum were collected to make 20% homogenate in the 10
mm phosphate buffer containing 5 mm edta, ph 7.4. the
small intestines were cut longitudinally, and the mucous
membrane was scraped gently with a slide. the mucosal
scrapings were then mixed with 5 volumes (w/v) of 10 mm
phosphate buffer containing 5 mm edta, ph 7.4, and homogenized to make 20% homogenates. the homogenates
were subjected to differential centrifugation to isolate mitochondrial, post-mitochondrial (s9), cytosol and microsomes
fractions [20,21]. the protein concentration of the subcellular fractions and the intestinal contents were determined with
a commercially available kit (bca protein assay; pierce
chemical co., rockford, il) as described by the manufacturer. all subcellular fractions and intestinal contents were
stored at -80 c before use.
2.6. in vitro incubation
to determine the possible nadph dependent oxidative
metabolism, the metabolic reactions were conducted in a
medium containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph
7.4), 5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm nadp, 1.9 mm glucose 6phosphate, 1.2 u/ml  xxxg825xxx , 20
m ts and 1 mg/ml protein of each subcelluar fraction or
intestinal content in a total volume of 200 l. to test the
non-nad(p)h dependent metabolism, nad or nadp was
used as the cofactor while the nadph regenerating system
was omitted from the incubation medium. after preincubation for 5 min, the reaction was started by adding the corresponding cofactors as indicated. blank incubations contained
no cofactors or contained boiled subcellular fractions. all
reactions were carried out in triplicates at 37  c for 120 min
and terminated by adding four volumes of cold acetonitrile.
in order to determine the glucuronic acid conjugation
metabolism, the subcellular fractions were pretreated with
alamethicin (a helical pore-forming peptide) at 25 g of
alamethicin/mg of subcellular protein on ice for 15 min to
diminish the latency of ugt activity [22]. the reaction mixture consisted of 0.2 mg of each subcellular protein, 5 mm
udpga, 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm saccharic acid-1,4-lactone,
the nadph regenerating system containing 0.2 mm nadp,
1.9 mm  xxxd1292xxx , 1.2 u/ml glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4) in a final volume of 200 l. after preincubation for

5 min at 37°c, the reaction was started by adding udpga.
blank incubations contained no udpga, or no nadph
regenerating system or contained boiled subcellular proteins.
all reactions were incubated in triplicates at 37 c for 120
min and terminated by adding four volumes of cold acetonitrile. ts and its potential metabolites were extracted from the
medium by sonication for 30 min. the resultant supernatants
after centrifugation for 10 min at 10000 g were subjected to
both metabolites identification as described above and ts
quantification using a hplc method as described below.
for the enzymatic kinetics analysis, ts of different concentration from 1.25 to 40 m was incubated with either
cytosol or s9 fractions in a condition as described for the
glucuronic acid conjugation experiment. the reaction conditions including subcellular proteins content (0.05~2mg/ml)
and reaction time (15~180 min) were optimized to ensure the
linear reaction. finally, 1mg/ml of subcellular proteins was
used for a 120 min reaction.
 xxxd1875xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx  [22,23], was
used to determine the potential role of  xxxg1592xxx  on ts metabolism. the reactions were conducted in the s9 fraction incubated in a condition as described above for testing the glucuronic acid conjugation. the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect was tested with 1, 5, 25 and 100 m  xxxd1875xxx ,
and with ts concentration maintained at 20 m in all reactions. for the inhibitory enzyme kinetics analysis,  xxxd1875xxx  concentration was set at 0 and 25 m while the substrate
concentrations ranged from 1.25 to 40 m.
to determine the  xxxd2298xxx  generated during ts
metabolism, ts was incubated with cytosol, microsomes or
s9 fractions in a condition as described above. the potential
inhibitory effect of  xxxd1875xxx  on the  xxxd2298xxx 
generation was also determined at a concentration of 25 m.
quantitation of h2o2 was based on the horseradish peroxidase (hrpo)-dependent oxidation of phenol red which is
assayed by its increased absorbance at 600 nm [24,25].
briefly, the hrpo-phenol red reagent (25 u/2.8 mm) was
added into the reaction medium after 1 h incubation and incubated for another 15 min. the reaction was terminated by
adding 20 l of 2 n naoh. absorption at 600 nm was read
using an immunoassay reader. the concentration of  xxxd2298xxx  was calculated from an accompanying calibration curve prepared at a concentration range of 1~60 m.
2.7. pharmacokinetic study
the rats were pretreated with  xxxd1875xxx  for a consecutive five days with an oral dose of 2 mg/kg. blank control
rats were pretreated with normal water. thirty minutes after
the last  xxxd1875xxx  dose, the rats were intragastrically (20
mg/kg) or intravenously (2 mg/kg) administered with ts
colloidal suspensions. blood (about 250 l) was collected
predose and at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h post
dose into a heparinized eppendorf tubes. plasma (100 l)
was separated by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min and
stored at -20 c before analysis.
2.8. ts quantification
samples obtained from the in vitro metabolism were analyzed using a well developed and validated hplc-uv
method. 1,8- xxxd2657xxx  at a final concentration

hao et al.

of 1g/ml was used as an internal standard. a shimazu
lc-2010c lc system consisting of a quaternary pump,
autosampler, column oven and uv detector was used. analytes separation was achieved on a 150mm  5.0mm shimpack vp-ods analytical column (shimadzu, kyoto, japan.)
using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 85% acetonitrile and 15% water at a flow rate of 1ml/min. calibration
curves with a concentration range of 0.05~12 g/ml were
prepared daily. with the correlation coefficients exceeding
0.997, this method was proved to be linear over such a concentration range. the lower limits of quantification were
determined to be 0.05 g/ml. the accuracies were determined within a range of 95% to 106%, and the intra and inter-batch precisions were within 10%.
plasma samples obtained from the in vivo pharmacokinetic study were analyzed using our previously reported lcms/ms method [26] with slight modification. the lcms/ms system consisted of a finnigan surveyor™ hplc
and tsq quantum discovery max system (thermo electron,
san jose, ca, usa). separations of analytes were achieved
using a 150mm  2.0mm shim-pack vp-ods analytical
column (shimadzu, kyoto, japan.) protected by a security
guard (phenomenex inc.). the mobile phase consisted of
acetonitrile- 0.05% ammonia (80:20,v/v) with the flow rate
set at 0.2 ml/min. mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. quantification was performed using selected
reaction monitoring (srm) of the transitions of m/z
295277 for ts and m/z 285193 for the diazepam (i.s.),
respectively.
2.9. data analysis and statistical comparisons
metabolic rate was expressed as pmol/min/mg protein.
enzyme kinetic analysis was conducted using a computer
program (sigmaplot 2000). kinetic parameters were estimated from the fitted curves using suitable model determined from the goodness of fitting. the following equations
were applied for assuming a michaelis-menten equation: v
=vmaxs/(km+s), where km is a michaelis-menten constant and vmax is maximum velocity.
the plasma concentrations and time data obtained from
the intravenous dose of ts were input into the pharmacokinetic software (das 2.0, china) for the compartment model
analysis. a three compartment model was found to best fit
the pharmacokinetic plasma profile of ts followed intravenous dose. the maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and
the time to reach cmax (tmax) were visually determined from
the observed data for the intragastrical doses. the area under
the concentration-time curves from zero to t h (auc0-t h) was
calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. auc from zero

table 1.

to infinity (auc0-) was calculated as the sum of auc0-t h
and the extrapolated part of the auc (aucextra, the ratio of
the concentration at t h to the terminal rate constants calculated from the last three concentrations).
student’s t test was used for the statistical comparisons
between two groups. one way anova analysis followed by
post-hoc comparisons was used for the multi-comparisons.
3. results
3.1. differentiation of hepatic and intestinal first pass
metabolism
using a method of four different dosing routes, we were
able to differentiate the hepatic and intestinal first pass metabolism of ts. the important pharmacokinetic parameters
were listed in table 1. the aucs of ts after iv and ipv administration were comparable suggesting that the hepatic
first pass metabolism of ts was almost negligible, if any.
the statistical comparison of the aucs for ig and id dosing
indicated that ts underwent no first pass metabolism in the
stomach. however, the auc of ts for intraduodenal administration was only 3.7 % of that for intraportal dosing.
furthermore, the original ts recovered from the total gi
tract 12 h after the oral administration was only 28.5 % of
the total dose. these results combined suggested that the
intestinal first pass metabolism for ts was tremendously and
predominantly in rats (approximately 67 %).
3.2. metabolites identification
the potential metabolites of ts in the rat gastrointestinal
tract were characterized by the combining lc-dad-ms and
lc-ms/ms analysis. their structures were proposed from
their respective retention time, light spectrum, molecular
ions, product ions and neutral loss information. shown in
fig. (1) are the reconstructed chromatograms with the detection wavelength set at 260 nm. five potential metabolites
labeled as m1~m5 were identified from the gastrointestinal
homogenates post oral dose of ts (fig. (1a)). no corresponding interference was detected in the blank intestinal
homogenate (fig. (1b)).the protonated molecular ion [m+h]
+
for m1 and m3 was same at m/z 471. m2 and m4 showed
the same [m+h] + at m/z 473. the protonated molecular ion
[m+h] + for m5 was at m/z 293. the information in detail
was summarized in table 2.
lc-ms/ms analysis was adopted to obtain the fragmentation patterns and to carry out the neutral loss scan of 176
da (glucuronic acid moity) for the possible glucuronidation
metabolites. the fragmentation patterns were shown in fig
(2). as the reference compound for the structural elucidation

of metabolites, the fragmentation pattern of the ts protonated molecular ion (m/z 295) was examined firstly. it
showed the formation of major fragment ions at m/z 277
(loss of water group) and m/z 280 (loss of methyl group). m5
was characterized to be dehydrotanshinone iia based on the
comparisons of the retention time, light spectrum and fragmentation pattern with that of the authentic standard. m1 and
m3 showed the same fragmentation pattern. diagnostic
fragment ion of m/z 277 was formed from the dehydration of
deconjungated ion at m/z 295. further neutral loss of 176 da
analysis confirmed that they were actually the glucuronic
acid conjugations. m2 and m4 also showed the same fragmentation pattern. the neutral loss of 176 da analysis and
the fragmentation patterns suggested they were the glucuronic acid conjugations of a molecular ion at m/z 297. hydrolysis of the intestinal homogenates using -glucuronidase
recovered only ts and dehydrotanshinone iia. since there is
no hydroxyl group in ts and dehydrotanshinone iia, we
proposed that they might firstly be reduced to the corresponding catechols which were subject to the glucuronic acid
conjugations. we failed to detect the responsible catechols
possibly due to their high instability. such a proposition was
confirmed in the subsequent in vitro metabolism study.

3.3. subcelluar fractions responsible for ts metabolism
to determine the subcellular fractions responsible for ts
metabolism, ts was incubated with mitochondrial, cytosol,
microsomes and s9 fractions. incubation with the intestinal
contents was also carried out to determine the possible bacterium catalyzed metabolism. the results in detail were summarized in table 3. ts underwent negligible metabolic
elimination in all of the subcellular fractions and in the intestinal contents when the reactions were conducted in a
nadph dependent phase i metabolism condition. when
nadp was used as the cofactor, ts underwent slight metabolic elimination in the mitochondrial (23.8% elimination)
and s9 incubations (15.5% elimination). no significant
metabolic elimination of ts was observed when only udpga was included as the cofactor in the phase ii incubation
medium. however, when both nadph and udpga were
added, significant and substantial metabolic elimination of
ts was observed in the cytosol (37.4% elimination) and s9
fractions (64.7%), but not in the microsomes incubations.
the metabolic elimination rates calculated from cytosol and
s9 fractions were 9.52 and 16.52 pmol/min/mg proteins,
respectively. metabolites scan and characterization showed

were observed in the s9 incubation system containing both nadph and udpga.

3.4. enzyme kinetics
since only cytosol and s9 fractions exhibited substantial
catalytic capacity against ts, the enzyme kinetics for metabolism elimination were conducted in the cytosol and s9
fractions at a substrate concentration range of 1.25 to 40 m.
the obtained kinetic parameters were shown in table 5. as
expectedly, there was no significant difference in km values
for ts metabolism in the cytosol and s9 fractions. the vmax
value for the s9 fraction was significantly higher than that
for the cytosol fraction (42.9 vs 16.8 pmol/min/mg protein).
the intrinsic clearance calculated from vmax/ km for the s9
fraction was 1.5 l/min/mg protein, significantly higher
than that for the cytosol fraction (0.66 l/min/mg protein).

the potential concentration dependent inhibitory effect
of  xxxd1875xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx , on the ts metabolism elimination was determined in the intestinal s9

metabolic elimination from a concentration of 1 to 100 m.
further enzymatic inhibition kinetics analysis showed that

3.6.  xxxd2298xxx  generation
we failed to detect the postulated catechol intermediates
in both the nadph dependent phase i and udpga mediated phase ii metabolic systems. therefore, we hypothesized
that such a catechol intermediate was highly unstable and
might be autooxidized back to ts, accompanied with  xxxd2298xxx  generation. as shown in fig. (6), substantial
amount of  xxxd2298xxx  was generated in the cytosol
and s9 fractions while not in the microsomes fractions coincubated in a nadph dependent phase i metabolic system.
furthermore,  xxxd2298xxx  generation was significant
higher in the cytosol fractions than that in the s9 fractions.
addition of  xxxd1875xxx  significantly inhibited the hydrogen
peroxide generation in the s9 fractions. interestingly, when
udpga was added to initiate the phase ii metabolism, the
 xxxd2298xxx  generation was completely inhibited.

3.7. influence of  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment on ts pharmacokinetics
to further characterize the role of  xxxg1592xxx  on the intestinal
first pass metabolism of ts, the rats were orally pretreated
with  xxxd1875xxx  for five consecutive days. subsequently, the
pharmacokinetics of ts after either oral or intravenous dose
was evaluated. the plasma pharmacokinetic profiles for the
oral and intravenous dose were shown in fig. (7) and fig.
(8), respectively; and the calculated important parameters
were summarized in table 6 and 7.  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment
exerted negligible effect on the ts pharmacokinetic profile
of intravenous dose, evidenced from the fact that there was
no significant difference in all of the parameters including
t1/2, t1/2, t1/2, auc and body clearance. however, the
pharmacokinetic profile of ts after oral dose was significantly changed by the  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment. the cmax was

4. discussion
the intestine represents the first barrier for the absorption
of xenobiotics including therapeutic drugs, and that contained in the dietary food and in the environmental pollutants. as a physiologically protective mechanism, the intestine positively expressed a whole set of xenobiotics metabolic enzymes consisting of that for phase i metabolism and
phase ii conjugations, and efflux transporters. actually, the
intestinal first pass metabolism had been proved to contribute much to the overall presystemic metabolism of many
drugs such as cyclosporin, midazolam, nifedipine and tacrolimus [27]. although a lot of reports contributed to the
better understanding of the role of intestine on first pass metable 7.

tabolism, most reports concentrated only on the cyp3a4
mediated metabolism or the direct phase ii conjugations.
current understanding of other potential metabolic pathways
in intestine is still rather limited as compared to that in liver.
quinones are ubiquitous in nature and represent a very
important class of therapeutic drugs, especially that for the
antitumor [28] and antioxidant therapy [29, 30]. in spite of
lots of reports concerning their physiological, pharmacological or toxicological consequences, rather little is know about
their potential intestinal first pass metabolism. in the present
study, we discovered a novel intestinal metabolic pathway
for quinones using ts, a derivative of phenanthrene-quinone
isolated from salvia miltiorrhiza, as a model compound.
considering that the absolute bioavailability of ts was
extremely low and a fine solid dispersion failed to reach a
great improvement [16], we hypothesized that the first pass
metabolism would play an important role on causing the low
bioavailability of ts. to verify such a hypothesis, we firstly
introduced a method of four dosing routes of pharmacokinetics study to confirm the first pass metabolism and to locate
the predominant first pass site. results obtained from this
study confirmed that about 70% of ts loss from the gi tract
could be attributed to the extensive first pass metabolism,
evidenced from the fact that only 28.5% of the original ts
dose was recovered from the total gi tract 12 h after the oral
dose while the absolute oral bioavailability was below 3%.
the aucs for the intravenous and intraportal administration
were comparable, suggesting that the hepatic first pass metabolism was negligible, if any. however, the auc for intraduodenal administration was only 3.7 % of that for intraportal dose, supporting that the intestine was the predominant site of ts first pass metabolism.
in order to further confirm the intestinal first pass metabolism and to verify the metabolic pathway, we made a
research into identifying the metabolites formed in the gi
tract after an oral dose of ts. the results confirmed that ts
actually underwent substantial first pass intestinal metabolism in the fact that five metabolites were identified from the
intestinal homogenates. since the absolute bioavailability of
ts was below 3.5% and the hepatic first pass metabolism
had been proved to be negligible, the metabolites recovered
from the gi tract were predominantly formed in the gi tract
itself. the possibility of systemic metabolism and subsequent distributing or excreting into the gi tract was negligible, if any.
based on the information of retention time, light spectrum, precursor and product ions and neutral loss analysis,
the five metabolites found in the gi tract were presumed to
be dehydrotanshinone iia catechol glucuronides (m1, m3),

ts catechol glucuronides (m2, m4) and dehydrotanshinone
iia. the chemical structure of m5 was confirmed by comparing with the authentic standard. the precursor, product
ions and neutral loss analysis indicated that m1 and m3 was
the position isomers of glucuronic acid conjugations of a
molecular 294, while m2 and m4 was that of a compound
with molecular weight of 296, 2 da higher than that of
dehdyrotanshinone iia and ts, respectively. since there is
no hydroxyl group in dehydrotanshinone iia and ts, we
postulated that they might be firstly reduced to the respective
catechols which were subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid to form m1 and m3, m2 and m4, respectively.

postulate that the catechol intermediate should be highly
unstable. the unstable catechol may be either autoxidized
back to the quinone or subject to glucuronic acid conjugation, which was dependent on its metabolic environment.
such a hypothesis was proved by the experimental facts that
the substantial generation of  xxxd2298xxx  was observed in the procedure of ts metabolism in the cytosol and
s9 fractions using nadph as the cofactor, and the addition
of udpga completely inhibited the  xxxd2298xxx  generation. the quinone reduction and subsequent autoxidation,
which was known as the quinone redox cycle, had been
widely observed for many other quinones [33, 34].

it was well known that quinones may undergo a twoelectron reduction catalyzed by a cytosolic enzyme,  xxxg1592xxx ,
using either nadh or nadph as the reducing cofactor to
form hydroquinone or catechol [31, 32]. however, we failed
to detect such an intermediate in both of the in vivo and in
vitro metabolic medium. furthermore, no significant metabolic elimination had been observed when ts was incubated
in a nadph dependent phase i metabolic conditions in all
of the subcellular fractions including cytosol, microsomes,
s9 and mitochondrial. however, substantial metabolic elimination was found when ts was incubated in the cytosol and
s9 fractions when both nadph and udpga were added
into the incubation medium. metabolites analysis confirmed
that m2 and m4 (presumed to be ts catechol glucuronides)
identified from the intestinal homogenates were formed in
such an in vitro metabolic system. these results lead us to

to determine whether the ts reduction was catalyzed by
 xxxg1592xxx , we tested the potential inhibitory effect of  xxxd1875xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx , on the ts metabolic elimination. it was observed that  xxxd1875xxx  exerted a concentration dependent and a substantial inhibitory effect on the
metabolic elimination of ts in the s9 fractions in a noncompetitive mode.  xxxd1875xxx  could also completely inhibit the
 xxxd2298xxx  generation from the ts redox cycle. these
results gave strong evidences that the ts reduction was predominantly  xxxg1592xxx  dependent. the positive expression and
enzyme activity of  xxxg1592xxx  in the rat intestinal mucosa had
been proved by the previous reports [35,36], supporting our
hypothesis of that the intestinal expressed  xxxg1592xxx  might play
an important role on the quinones first pass metabolism.
to further characterize the role of  xxxg1592xxx  on the presystemic metabolism of ts, the influence of  xxxd1875xxx  pre-

identification of a novel intestinal first pass metabolic pathway

treatment on ts pharmacokinetic profiles was determined.
results showed that the ts oral bioavailability was significantly enhanced by a consecutive five days pretreatment of
 xxxd1875xxx , evidenced from the increased auc and cmax.
the prolonged tmax after  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment was an
indicator of the inhibited intestinal first pass metabolism and
the resultant prolonged absorption. however, the pharmacokinetic profile of ts after intravenous dose was not significantly changed by the  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment, suggesting that the oral  xxxd1875xxx  pretreatment had little effect on
the systemic metabolism of ts. this result was not surprising, considering that the oral absorption of  xxxd1875xxx  was
extremely poor.
the dehydrogenation metabolism was another metabolic
pathway for the intestinal first pass metabolism of ts. using
nadp as the hydrogen receptor, a slight metabolic elimination of ts was observed in the mitochondrial fraction, and
dehydrotanshinone iia was actually detected from the metabolic medium, suggesting that the ts dehydrogenation may
be catalyzed by a mitochondrial dehydrogenase remained
unknown. same as ts, the phase i metabolite dehydrotanshinone iia was also subjected to further quinone reduction
and subsequent glucuronidation. no single hydroxyl metabolite of ts, as that observed from the liver microsomes [37]
incubation and the rat bile [38], was observed in the intestinal metabolic environment both in vitro and in vivo. these
results suggest that cyp450 may play a negligible role on
the intestinal metabolism of ts. the final common metabolic pathway of ts and its dehydrogenation metabolite was
the  xxxg1592xxx  mediated quinone reduction and subsequent glucuronidation. the proposed intestinal metabolic pathway of
ts was shown in fig. (9).
in conclusion, a novel intestinal metabolic pathway underlying the first pass effect of quinones,  xxxg1592xxx  mediated
quinone reduction and subsequent glucuronidation has been
demonstrated using ts as a model compound in the present
study. the fate of the quinones in the intestine or other biological environments is mainly dependent on the balance of
the enzyme expression and activity of  xxxg1592xxx  and ugt. the
intestinal expressed  xxxg1592xxx  and various ugt isoenzymes
may play an important role on the first pass metabolism of
many quinones. the results obtained from the present study
may be helpful for the general understanding of the intestinal
absorption and metabolism of other quinones which are of
great physiological, pharmacological or toxicological importance.
