abstract

the relative binding affinities (rba) of two locally used glucocorticoids,  xxxd3124xxx  and  xxxd2126xxx  have
been measured for the  xxxg1601xxx  of human synovial tissue. the non-fluorinated derivative
 xxxd3124xxx  exhibited a binding affinity (rba of 130) somewhat higher than that of dexamethasone
(rba of 100) but lower than that of  xxxd2126xxx  (rba 190). potential metabolites of  xxxd3124xxx 
hydroxolated at the c~ 7 side-chain, showed decreased binding affinities, while the 6-hydroxy metabolite
of  xxxd3124xxx  and  xxxd2126xxx  (its main metabolite) and the 4,5-dihydro metabolites of  xxxd3124xxx  hardly
bound at all. these results support previous pharmacological findings that the high ratio of local to
systemic effects of both compounds are due to a pronounced receptor affinity of the parent compounds
and the fast systemic metabolism to derivatives with low pharmacodynamic activity.

introduction

glucocorticoids with high intrinsic activity but
fast systemic metabolism are likely to express maximal local activity with minimal systemic side effects under the assumption the formed metabolites
are pharmacologically inactive.  xxxd3124xxx 
( xxxd3124xxx ), presently in clinical trials for intraarticular use, and  xxxd2126xxx , used as aerosol in the
treatment of asthma, have been shown to express
high local activity with only low systemic side effects [1- 5]. relative binding affinities of glucocorticoid agonists for the human  xxxg1601xxx  correlate well with their pharmacological
activity at the site of action [6]. in order to gain
more detailed information about the pharmacodynamic properties of the above substances, we
determined the binding affinities of  xxxd3124xxx 
correspondenceto: dr. g. hochhaus.

( xxxd3124xxx ),  xxxd2126xxx  and their main metabolites for the human  xxxg1601xxx . synovial tissue was used as receptor source that expresses glucocorticoid receptors with binding
properties identical to those found in the human
lung [7].
materials and methods

materials

1,4 dithiothreitol,  xxxd3216xxx , glycerol,
tris/hcl (ph 7.4) and activated charcoal
were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). [3h] xxxd3418xxx  (specific activity: 43.
ci/mm01) was obtained from new england nuclear boston, ma).  xxxd3124xxx  (i it-hydroxy16 a, 17, 21 - trimethylpregna - 1,4- diene- 3,20 - dione)
and its putative metabolites were kindly provided
by organon (oss, the netherlands).  xxxd2126xxx 

378
(6c~-fluoro-llfl, 21-dihydroxy-16c~,17-isopropylidenedioxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione) and 6flhydroxy  xxxd2126xxx  were provided by syntex
(aachen, frg). the purity of these compounds
was checked by hplc using a cls reversed phase
column, a mobile phase of 40% acetonitrile in
0.05 m phosphate buffer (ph 4) and uv detection
at 254 nm. all other chemicals were of analytical
grade.

cytosol preparation
human synovial tissue was obtained from patients
who had to undergo synovectomy because of
chronic arthritis. immediately after the resection,
the tissue was frozen and stored for not more than
4 weeks in liquid nitrogen. the cytosol was prepared with slight modifications as described earlier
[8]. briefly, the frozen tissue was crashed to small
pieces. the tissue was then further homogenized
after addition of 2 vol of ice cooled incubation
buffer (10 nm tris/hc1, 10 m m  xxxd3216xxx , 2 m m 1,4-dithiothreitol) using a virtus 45
homogenizer (4-45 sec, full speed, with a 1 min
cooling period between every step). the homogenate was centrifuged for 1 hour at 4~ at
105 000 g in a beckman ultracentrifuge (l8-70 m)
using a ti 70 rotor. the resulting aqueous supernatant (cytosol) was stored in liquid nitrogen after
addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol.

binding studies
portions of the cytosol (160 ixl) were incubated
with 20 gl of [ah]- xxxd3418xxx  (final
concentration in the incubation mixture: 10 rim)
and the same volume of varying concentrations of
competitor (prepared in incubation buffer containing 50% ethanol). this ethanol concentration did
not affect the ics0 value of dexamethasone. after
24 hours, unbound steroid was removed by addition of 400 gl activated charcoal suspension (2% in
incubation buffer). the mixture was incubated for
10 rain at 0 - 4 ~
and then centrifuged for 5 rain
at 10000 rpm (savant high speed centrifuge). the
radioactivity (cpm) in 400 gl supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. the nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of
1 0 - 6 m unlabeled dexamethasone. it was always
smaller than 40% of the total binding. all determinations were performed in triplicate.

data analysis
the icso values of the investigated steroids (competitor concentration necessary to displace 50% of
the specific 3h- xxxd3418xxx  binding)
and the slope factors of resulting competition
curves were determined by a non-linear curve fitting procedure using the non-lin module of the
macintosh systat version. therefore, the data
were fitted to the logistic function:
b = bmax - bmax * ln/(ln + ic~o) + ns
with
b:
cpm in the presence of competitor
bmax: cpm in the absence of competitor
ns:
cpm for nonspecific binding conditions
l
competitor concentration
n
hill slope factor
buax and ns (calculated from the average values
obtained from a set of experiments) were treated as
constants in the non-linear curve fitting procedure.
the resulting icso values were transformed into
relative receptor affinities (rra) relative to the
reference substance dexamethasone (rra:100):
rrax = 100 * icso. d,~,/ic 5o. x
results

the binding affinities of the investigated compounds (fig. 1) were determined in the cytosol of
human synovial tissue that expresses a  xxxd3418xxx  binding protein with all the
characteristics of the glueocorticoid receptor [7]. a
long incubation period (24 hrs at 6 ~ insured the
binding equilibrium and therefore reliable estimates of the relative binding affinities [9, 10]. experiments were performed with cytosol that was
stored in liquid nitrogen since preliminary studies
revealed that only a slight (10-20%) loss of specific 3h- xxxd3418xxx  binding (10 nm,
24 h incubation at 6 ~ was observed after 7 days
of storage.
since, the metabolism of  xxxd3124xxx  is not described in the literature we included derivatives of
 xxxd3124xxx  that are likely to be generated as potential metabolites.
the inhibitory effects of the investigated steoids on
the binding of [3h]- xxxd3418xxx  are
shown for one set of experiments in fig. 2. in all

competitive binding experiments were performed with cytosol
prepared from human synovial tissue as described under materials and methods. the range of values in parenthesis was observed
from two independent experiments. if more then two independent experiments were performed, the standard error is given.
~data for human lung were taken from ref. 6 and are given here
for the reason of comparison.
discussion
both substances,  xxxd3124xxx  and  xxxd2126xxx , possess b i n d i n g a f f i n i t i e s t o t h e h u m a n g l u c o c o r t i c o i d

the difference in affinity between the 6-fluoro de-

rivative  xxxd2126xxx  and the 9-fluoro derivative  xxxd3418xxx  (both differ only in the position of fluorination) has been also observed for the
corresponding fluoro-derivatives of hydrocortisone
[11]. looking at structure affinity relationships
found for other glucocorticoids [9], it seems very
likely that the high affinity for the non-fluorinated
 xxxd3124xxx  is related to the lipophilic moieties in
position 16 and 17. however, clear structure affinity relationships can not be gained from these data
because the investigated compounds differ in more
then one functional group (c~7 side-chain, fluorination, 16, 17-substitution).
a dramatic reduction in affinity was observed for
the main metabolite [4] of  xxxd2126xxx  the 6r-ohderivative. low affinities were seen also for the 6/~oh derivative of  xxxd3124xxx  (org 20153) and the
5 , and 5 fl-h derivatives (org 6644 and org
6351, respectively). this loss of activity is in agreement with the general principle of corticosteroid
inactivation by means of these metabolic routes
[12]. the effect of side-chain hydroxylation on the
receptor binding was not uniform. the potential
metabolite org 20230 (the 21/~-oh-derivative)
has a slightly higher affinity than the 21 e-oh
derivative org 20229 (table 1). a pronounced
decrease was observed for org 7115 (the 22-oh
derivative). this demonstrates the sensitivity of the
receptor affinity to steric and electronic changes in
the ca7 side-chain. 21-desoxydexamethasone has
been reported to bind with two times lower binding affinity to the receptor than the parent compound dexamethasone [13]. in agreement with this
observation none of the side-chain hydroxylated
derivatives exhibited a higher affinity than the parent compound.
in conclusion,  xxxd3124xxx  and  xxxd2126xxx  bind
with higher affinities to the  xxxg1601xxx 
than dexamethasone while its putative metabolites
show a pronounced loss in activity. a direct relationship between receptor affinity and local antiinftammatory potency in humans has been demonstrated for full glucocorticoid agonists [6]. the significant difference in the receptor binding affinities
for the parent compounds and main metabolites
found in this study, together with their fast metabolic transformation [1, 4, 5], accounts for the high
ratio of local to systemic activity of  xxxd3124xxx 
and  xxxd2126xxx .
