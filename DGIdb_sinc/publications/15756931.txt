in this study we investigated the eﬀects of  xxxd3311xxx , a type 2 cyclooxygenase (cox-2)
inhibitor, on brain damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion. male wistar rats (18-month
old average) were anesthetized and submitted to ischemia occlusion of both common carotid arteries (bcao) for 45 min. after 24 h of reperfusion, rats were decapitated and hippocampi removed for further assays. animals were divided into sham-operated, ischemia,
ischemia +  xxxd3311xxx  2.5 mg/kg, and ischemia +  xxxd3311xxx  10 mg/kg groups.  xxxd3311xxx  was administered intraperitoneally immediately after bcao. histological analyses
show that ischemia produced signiﬁcant striatal as well as hippocampal lesions which were
reversed by the  xxxd3311xxx  treatment.  xxxd3311xxx  also signiﬁcantly reduced, to control levels, the increased myeloperoxidase activity in hippocampus homogenates observed after
ischemia. however, nitrite concentrations showed only a tendency to decrease in the ischemia +  xxxd3311xxx  groups, as compared to that of ischemia alone. on the other hand, hippocampal glutamate and aspartate levels were not altered by  xxxd3311xxx . in conclusion, we
showed that ischemia is certainly related to inﬂammation and to increased free radical production, and selective cox-2 inhibitors might be neuroprotective agents of potential beneﬁt
in the treatment of cerebral brain ischemia.

it is largely accepted that cerebral ischemic injury is
the result of several pathogenic factors acting in a
coordinated fashion (7). ionic and chemical changes
initiated by ischemia-induced energy failure lead to
a variety of biochemical eﬀects that ultimately result
in tissue damage, and these biochemical and molecular events are associated with marked cellular
changes (8,9). furthermore, brain ischemia initiates
a complex cascade of metabolic events closely associated with the generation of nitrogen and oxygen
free radicals (10).
the ﬁrst result of energy depletion is failure of
na+ and k+ pumps, leading to depolarization of
the neuronal membrane. synaptic function and conductivity are lost at this point, and the inﬂux of

introduction
the pathologic process underlying the majority
of ischemic stroke in humans is an inﬂammatory
process (1) and experimental studies have reported
the role of inﬂammation in ischemic damage (2–6).

na+ causes cellular edema. additional structural
damage leads to the development of ca2+ inﬂux
into neurons, resulting from the opening of voltagegated ca2+ channels and, more importantly, from
the action of glutamate. ca2+ also activates nitric
oxide (no) synthase, inducing no and free radical
productions (11,12). evidences accumulated over
the past several years suggest that no and
cyclooxygenase (cox) products are involved in
mechanisms by which post-ischemic inﬂammation
contributes to ischemic brain injury (13–15). recent
data have shown that cox-2 reaction products and
reactive oxygen species, at the border of the ischemic area (penumbra zone) in experimental cerebral
ischemia, exacerbate ischemic damage (14), and neuronal and glial cox-2 induction was evident in the
peri-infarcted areas (6).
previous studies (16,17) in rodent stroke models
have shown that the inducible cox-2 isoform promotes neuronal injury, and the administration of
cox-2 inhibitors reduces infarct volume. pge2, the
main prostaglandin product of cox-2 enzymatic
activity, exerts its downstream eﬀects by signaling
through a class of four distinct g-protein coupled
ep receptors. in vitro studies with hippocampal cell
cultures demonstrated that activation of the ep2b
receptor was neuroprotective on nmda toxicity
and oxygen glucose deprivation (18). besides, in the
middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion model
of transient forebrain ischemia, genetic deletion of
the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor signiﬁcantly increased cerebral
infarction in cerebral cortex and subcortical structures. furthermore, up-regulation of cox-2 and
pge2 elevation have been reported to occur after
cerebral ischemic insults and pge2, acting via an
 xxxg1873xxx -like receptor, induces apoptosis in neurons (19).
vasoactive substances, such as  xxxd208xxx 
and thromboxane a2, are released by recirculated
platelets that could be activated by damaged endothelial cells in the ischemic process (20). the major
interest in mechanisms of secondary brain damage,
after reperfusion, is that this period is a potential
therapeutic target (11). the only currently available
treatment for acute ischemic stroke, such as thrombolysis, can induce further tissue damage, through
mechanisms involved in reperfusion injury that partially or completely eliminate the beneﬁts of reperfusion itself (21–23).
therefore, a multifaceted treatment is likely to
be the future of stroke management, combining
thrombolysis with free radical scavengers and
anti-inﬂammatory therapies (24–26). the patho-

galvão et al.
physiology of cerebral ischemia is well studied in
small-animal models, allowing insights into the
ischemic penumbra, gene expression in ischemia,
and neuroprotection therapy (27). several studies
suggested that cox-2 plays a role in ischemic neuronal death (16,28), and the genetic disruption of
cox-2 has been shown to reduce the susceptibility
to focal injury and nmda-mediated neurotoxicity
(29,30). although cox-2 seems to be a critical
pathogenic factor, in brain diseases associated with
activation of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors, including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, the cox-2 reaction products responsible for
these deleterious eﬀects have not been identiﬁed.
a recent study (31) directly implicates cox-2derived prostanoids, rather then radicals, in the
cox-2-dependent component of the damage mediated by nmda receptors, and strengthens the
rationale for using cox-2 inhibitors in the treatment of neurological diseases associated with
glutamate neurotoxicity. in the present work, we
investigated the eﬀects of  xxxd3311xxx , a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (nsaid) and known
inhibitor of cox-2 activity, on brain damage
induced by an ischemic-reperfusion model in aged
rats. we assessed some of the biochemical parameters involved in the ischemic phenomenon, such as
the determination of myeloperoxidase activity (enzymatic marker for inﬂammation), excitatory aminoacids, and nitrite concentrations.

experimental procedure
drugs. the following drugs were used:  xxxd3311xxx  (tilatil,
roche, brazil), ketamine (francotar, virbac, brazil), and xylazine (rompun, bayer, brazil). hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium
bromide, o-dianisidine, o-phtaldialdehyde, sulfanilamide, n-(1naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride were from sigma
chemical, mo, usa. all other reagents were of analytical grade.
animals. a total of 60 male aged wistar rats (18 month-old
on average, 350 g) from the animal house of the federal university of ceará, maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free
access to water and food were used. experiments were carried
out according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals, from the us department of health and human services, and the project was previously approved by the animals
ethic committee of the faculty of medicine, federal university
of ceará, brazil.
surgery procedure. animals were anesthetized with ketamine
(90 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). body temperature
was monitored with a rectal thermometer and maintained at 37c
with a heat lamp. both common carotid arteries were exposed
through a ventral midline cervical incision, and occluded with
aneurysm clips to induce ischemia. at the end of 45 min of bilateral

 xxxd3311xxx  neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
carotid arteries occlusion (bcao), the blood ﬂow was restored by
clips release, and the incision was closed with a single suture. after
24 h of reperfusion, rats were decapitated, brains dissected, and
hippocampi removed for biochemical measurements. animals were
divided into four groups (n ¼ 5): sham-operated, ischemia, ischemia +  xxxd3311xxx  2.5 mg/kg, ischemia +  xxxd3311xxx  10 mg/kg.
 xxxd3311xxx  was administered intraperitoneally once, immediately
after 45 min of bcao. this protocol was repeated for each biochemical measurement. physiological parameters (mean ± sem)
from three animals observed in the control (c) and bcao groups
were: ph (c ¼ 7.41 ± 0.023; bcao ¼ 7.37 ± 0.023), pco2
(c ¼ 30.1 ± 4.10; bcao ¼ 32.2 ± 3.550), po2 (c ¼ 71.05 ±
3.550; bcao ¼ 63.3 ± 8.41), so2 (c ¼ 94.00 ± 1.200; bcao ¼
89.80 ± 2.760).
measurement of myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity. mpo
activity was determined as described previously (32,33). brains
were removed and hippocampi frozen in liquid nitrogen. frozen
tissue specimens were homogenized in 50 mm phosphate buﬀer
(ph 6.0) and 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(htab). samples were freeze-thawed three times and sonicated
for 10 s at 25c, between cycles. after the last sonication, samples
were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4c, and mpo
activity was assayed in the supernatant. brieﬂy, 0.1 ml of the
supernatant was mixed with 2.9 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buﬀer (ph 6.0) containing 0.167 mg/ml o-dianisidine and
0.0005%  xxxd2298xxx . changes in absorbance at 460 nm
were measured by a beckman spectrophotometer, and mpo activity was calculated. one unit of mpo activity is deﬁned as that
which degrades one micromole of peroxide per minute at 25c.
determination of excitatory aminoacids. analysis of excitatory aminoacids was carried out with a high-performance liquid
chromatography (hplc, shimadzu, japan) method, and ﬂuorimetric detection as previously described (34). brieﬂy, frozen tissue
specimens were homogenized in 0.1 m perchloric acid and sonicated for 30 s at 25c. after sonication, samples were centrifuged
at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4c. supernatants were removed and
ﬁltered through a membrane (millipore, 0.2 l), and the aminoacids were derivatized with  xxxd26xxx  and o-phtaldialdehyde. o-phtaldialdehyde derivatives were then separated on a
3 lm clc-ods column (150 · 4.6 mm; from shimadzu, japan)
and, after derivatization, aminoacids were separated using a
mobile phase, consisting of sodium phosphate buﬀer (50 mm,
ph 5.5) and 20% methanol. the area of each peak was determined with a shimadzu software and compared with the peak
area of the corresponding external standard. aminoacid concentrations were expressed as lmol/g wet tissue.
nitrite determination. the hippocampus was homogenized
with 50% percloric acid, and the production of no was determined by the griess method. brieﬂy, 100 ll of 10% homogenate
was incubated with 100 ll of the griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide in 1% h3po4 /0.1% n-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride/1% h3po4/distilled water, 1:1:1:1) at room
temperature for 10 min. absorbance was measured at 550 nm by
a microplate reader. nitrite concentration was determined from a
standard nitrite curve by using nano2, and results expressed
as lm.
histological analysis. animals from the control, ischemic,
and ischemic +  xxxd3311xxx  10 mg/kg groups were killed by
decapitation and used for histological analyses. brains were
removed and ﬁxed in 10% formalin for 3 days. after an initial
coronal section at the level of the optic nerve, slices (5 lm) were
sequentially obtained from anterior (striatum level) and posterior

41

directions (hippocampus level) and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin for light microscopy studies. histological analyses were
done in a single blinded way, and structures were assessed
according to paxinos and watson (35). the degree of brain damage was based on the presence of pyknosis, vacuolization, and
inﬂammatory inﬁltration. lesion severity was deﬁned with scores
such as 0 or absent – no tissue damage, 1 or mild – less than
25% tissue damage, 2 or moderate – more than 25% and less
than 50% tissue damage, and 3 or severe – more than 50% tissue
damage.
statistical analysis. biochemical data were analyzed by
anova followed by dunnett’s multiple comparison test, and
expressed as mean ± sem. histological data were analyzed with
kruskall– wallis and mann–whitney tests, and expressed as
mean ± sd. results were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.

histological analysis

in the present work, aged rats were submitted
to ischemia by occlusion for 45 min of both carotids, followed by 24 h of reperfusion, and hippocampus homogenates were used to study biochemical
parameters, 24 h after the ischemia-reperfusion. the
hippocampus and mainly the hippocampal ca1
region is the most susceptible region to brain ischemia (36). the activity of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (mpo, a marker of neutrophil inﬁltration),
determinations of glutamate and aspartate (as an
index of neurotoxicity), and nitrite levels (indirectly
expressing the no production) were also assessed
before and after the interference of the antiinﬂammatory action of  xxxd3311xxx , in order to evaluate
its possible role as a neuroprotector agent under
ischemic conditions.

ischemia (bcao) induced lesions on the striatum and hippocampus. however, the striatum was
somehow more aﬀected. the treatment of animals
with  xxxd3311xxx  (10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reversed
ischemia-induced lesions, and in this group all animals presented only mild lesions as compared to the
ischemic group without treatment (table ii). fig. 3

our results showed that, 24 h of reperfusion
after the cerebral ischemia resulted in signiﬁcant
increases of mpo activity, what agrees with previous reports (5, 37–39). the reversion of this increase
with both doses of  xxxd3311xxx  brought mpo activity close to control levels, corroborating the hypothesis that inﬂammation is strongly involved with the
ischemic damage. as an anti-inﬂammatory drug,
 xxxd3311xxx  inhibits cyclooxygenase activity and
blocks products formation from the arachidonic
acid (aa), indirectly decreasing the activated neu-

43

trophils inﬁltration and, consequently, attenuating
production of reactive oxygen species, plateletactivating factor (paf), cytokines, chemokines and
lysosomal enzymes by those cells. many experimental studies demonstrated that the modulation of leukocytes participation in ischemia/reperfusion injury
may inﬂuence the magnitude of the resultant brain
damage (4,5,38,40). mpo activity is positively correlated with brain injury volume in rats treated with
anti-icam-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule) antibody and submitted to middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion, suggesting that mpo
activity is a signiﬁcant index for brain damage and
that the prevention of inﬂammation attenuates reperfusion-induced injury (41).
recently (5), a massive neutrophil deposition in
the brain, following transient ischemia in rats with
pre-ischemic hyperglycemia, was observed by immunohistochemical technique. these results showed
abundant mpo-positive cells within both pial and
parenchymal vessels, as well as within the parenchyma, 24 h after the hyperglycemic ischemia. mpo
deposition tended to decrease at the 3rd day. these
ﬁndings indicate an increase in granulocytes population, with a peak at 24 h after ischemia, observed in
a focal permanent cerebral ischemia model, in rats,
and demonstrate that an inﬂammatory process
occurs not only in transient but also in permanent
cerebral ischemia (3). in addition, inﬂuxes of leukocytes and platelets during a brain insult were also
observed (4). all these reports substantiate the key
role played by neutrophils in the ischemic injury,
and its contribution to infarction and intensiﬁcation
of the brain damage. similarly, we have demonstrated that striatal and hippocampal neurons
became markedly shrunken and vacuolizated, showing the presence of intense neutrophil inﬁltration,
and these changes were reversed by the  xxxd3311xxx 
treatment.
glutamate is widely believed to be the major
neurotransmitter in the brain and responsible for
generating excitatory responses. the concentration
of glutamate in the extracellular space, as well as
that of a variety of neurotransmitters, increases as a
function of the length of the ischemic period. the
available evidence indicates that there is no increase
during the post-ischemic period in the activity of
those neurons using glutamate as a neurotransmitter
(12). brain slices exposed to oxygen and glucose
deprivation (an in vitro model of ischemia) showed
increased glutamate and aspartate concentrations
which were detected up to the ﬁrst stages of

44
reperfusion, indicating that glutamate levels are
time-dependent (13). an increase in those aminoacid
levels was observed in hypertensive rats after focal
ischemia, by the microdialysis technique. signiﬁcant
elevations were seen immediately after 30 min of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao) which
returned to basal levels following reperfusion, indicating a positive correlation between the severity of
ischemic damage (lesion volume) and total extracellular levels of both glutamate and aspartate during
the mcao (42). interestingly, despite of these ﬁndings, we found that glutamate and aspartate levels
increased even after 24 h of reperfusion in the
group submitted to ischemia for 45 min. the
increased concentrations of glutamate and aspartate
obtained with ischemia-reperfusion were not altered
with  xxxd3311xxx  administration at both doses, probably because the inﬂammatory process is more expressive in the reperfusion phase. the great increase
in glutamate release occurs earlier in the ischemic
process, in the presence of energy failure associated
with intracellular acidosis and ca2+ca2+ accumulation (12).
recently, an age-related diﬀerence in the degree
of collateral blood ﬂow from the infra- to the
supra-tentorium was registered during carotid occlusion in rats, indicated by cerebral and cerebelar
blood ﬂow ratios. the blood supply from the
vertebro-basilar circulation to the brain was not
suﬃcient in aged rats after carotid occlusion, presumably because of the presence of sclerotic changes
in these arteries, and a more severe metabolic dearrangement was related to this incomplete collateral blood ﬂow. therefore, aging is an important
factor for the impaired vascular and cellular reactivities to neural, chemical, and physical stimuli (43–
45). this reason could justify, at least in part, the
persistent high levels of glutamate and aspartate, as
well as of nitrite concentrations, observed in the
present work, even after 24 h of reperfusion.
there are evidences showing that reactive
oxygen species (ros) are involved in hypoxic
ischemic tissue damages. thus, brain ischemia and
reperfusion lead to the production of free radicals
that contribute to the cerebral injury, and are
thought to be the most important cause of the
reperfusion injury subsequent to ischemia (39,46).
sugawara et al. (47), showed that the overexpression of superoxide dismutase reduced oxidative
stress and attenuated the mitochondrial release of
 xxxg569xxx  and smac (second mitochondriaderived activator of caspases), resulting in less cas-

galvão et al.
pase activation and apoptotic cell death in the rat
hippocampus after global ischemia. a number of
studies (48,49) have not only validated the importance of caspases activation in ischemia-induced
brain damage, but also reported the participation
of these enzymes in both the initiation and execution phases of apoptosis. recently (49), a novel
mitochondrial protein, apoptosis-inducing factor
(aif), has been implicated in caspase-independent
programmed cell death following its translocation
to the nucleus. these authors conclude that aif
may be involved in neuronal cell death after focal
cerebral ischemia, and that caspase-independent
signaling pathways downstream of mitochondria
may play a role in apoptotic-like cell death after
experimental stroke.
li et al. (50) examined cox-1 and cox-2
genes, and cox-2 protein expression and activity in
cortical regions of rat brain after exposure to either
intermittent hypoxia (ih) or sustained hypoxia.
they also assessed the eﬀect of selective cox-2
inhibition with ns-398 on ih-induced neurobehavioral deﬁcits, in rats, and showed that ih induced a
cox-2 up-regulation associated with increased
pge2 levels, neuronal apoptosis and neurobehavioral deﬁcits. the administration of ns-398 abolished ih-induced apoptosis and pge2 increases,
without modifying cox-2 mrna expression, and
attenuated ih-induced deﬁcits as assessed by the
water maze task.
our results showed a great increase in nitrite
levels 24 h after the ischemia-reperfusion, indicating
no derived free radicals production. although not
signiﬁcant, there was a tendency for a decreased
nitrite concentration and a return to normal levels,
in the ischemic group, after treatment with  xxxd3311xxx , as compared to ischemia alone. signiﬁcant
increases in no production, as measured by nitrite
determination, have been observed after ischemia in
the rat hippocampus by the in vivo microdialysis
technique (51). these authors observed that global
ischemia gave rise to a signiﬁcant increase in nitrite
levels at 15, 18, and 21 min after the onset of ischemia, and 6, 9, 12, and 15 min after reperfusion. in
our experiments, measurements were performed
24 h after reperfusion, and the ischemic period
lasted for 60 min. however, our results agree with a
recent work (52) showing that dialyzed no metabolites from the jugular vein increased immediately
after rat middle cerebral artery occlusion, reaching
a maximum at 46 h. another study (53) reported
that levels of nitrite and nitrate in the hippocampus

 xxxd3311xxx  neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
of wild-type mice were increased with time after
ischemia-reperfusion, whereas the increase was signiﬁcantly inhibited in il-1 knockout mice. their
results strongly suggest that endogenous il-1 contributes to ischemic brain damage, possibly through
the release of  xxxd2738xxx  by inos.
altogether, our results show that brain ischemia
is certainly related to inﬂammation and increased
free radical production. others (17) also detected
increased brain cox-2 expression after focal ischemia in rats. in this experiment, the sc58236 compound, a selective cox-2 inhibitor as  xxxd3311xxx ,
dose-dependently prevented ischemia-induced eicosanoid formation, and caused signiﬁcant reduction of
the damaged area. their data as ours open a new
therapeutic perspective, and suggest that selective
inhibitors of cox-2 are neuroprotective and of
potential beneﬁt in the treatment of cerebral brain
ischemia.
