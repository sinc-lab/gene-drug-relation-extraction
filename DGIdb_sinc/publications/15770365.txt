oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase
inhibitors

the rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) is associated with inflammation, destruction
of extracellular matrix, and production of both  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) and matrix
metalloproteinase-9 ( xxxg1440xxx ). indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, may
prevent aaa formation by inhibiting  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) activity. we hypothesized that
indomethacin, rofecoxib (selective cox-2 inhibitor), and  xxxd21xxx  (selective inos activity inhibitor) would decrease aneurysm formation in the rat model. forty-six male wistar rats underwent
intraaortic elastase infusion in two parallel studies based on medication delivery route. sixteen
rats were randomized to rofecoxib or water by gastric lavage. thirty rats were randomized to
subcutaneous saline, indomethacin, or  xxxd21xxx . heart rate, blood pressure and aortic diameters
were measured. western blot and mrna analysis for  xxxg1440xxx  and inos was performed
on postoperative day 7 aortic segments. elastin degradation and inflammation were evaluated
by immunohistochemistry. elastase infusion produced aaa in all rats.  xxxd21xxx  significantly limited aneurysm expansion (p = 0.01) whereas treatment with indomethacin and rofecoxib did not.
only  xxxd21xxx  significantly increased blood pressure (p < 0.001). indomethacin alone statistically
decreased  xxxg1440xxx  (p < 0.011).  xxxd21xxx  resulted in greater conservation of aortic elastin than
indomethacin (p = 0.025). all groups demonstrated statistically similar expression of inos. in
conclusion, selective inos activity inhibitor,  xxxd21xxx , significantly decreased aneurysm size and
preserved aortic elastin without altering  xxxg1440xxx  levels. indomethacin significantly decreased
 xxxg1440xxx  expression without decreasing aneurysm size. rofecoxib did not significantly decrease
 xxxg1440xxx  expression or aneurysm size. inhibition of inos limits aneurysmal expansion
by mechanisms other than  xxxg1440xxx  inhibition.  xxxg1440xxx  inhibition by indomethacin is not sufficient
to limit aneurysm expansion in our model.

9 ( xxxg1440xxx ).2,4-6 inhibition of inos with  xxxd2951xxx , a moderately selective agent, has been
shown to decrease aneurysm size in this model.2,3
indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase
inhibitor, has also been shown to inhibit aaa
formation in the animal model, possibly by
decreasing  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
activity.4,5
cox-2 activity has been implicated in human
aaa, where it is localized to inflammatory infiltrates but is not detected in normal aorta by in situ
hybridization.6 the potential role of  xxxd2738xxx 
(no) in human aaa is poorly understood, although
inos production by inflammatory cells is known to
increase no levels and generate toxic products
shown to degrade elastin.7,8 recently, no inhibition

has been shown to increase  xxxg1440xxx  expression in
rat aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro.9
 xxxd21xxx  is a highly selective inhibitor of inos
activity, being 1000 to 5000 times more selective
for inos than endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
(enos).10 indomethacin is a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor of both cox-1 and cox-2
activity whereas rofecoxib is a selective inhibitor of
cox-2.11 the current study investigates the effect
of nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibition, selective
cox-2 inhibition, and highly selective inos inhibition on experimental aaa production. the effect
of these agents on inos and  xxxg1440xxx  expression was
also evaluated, as was the effect of these therapies
on aortic inflammation and elastin integrity.

methods
animal surgery
adult male wistar rats (275-400 g) underwent
surgery as described by anidjar et al.12 and modified by bigatel et al.13 the described protocols were
reviewed and approved by the institutional animal
care and use committee. the animal care complied with the guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals, institute of laboratory animal resources,
commission on life sciences, and national research council (national academy press, washington, 1996). rats were anesthetized with 1.52.5% inhalational isoflurane anesthesia. a midline
laparotomy was performed with sterile technique
and a 1-cm segment of infrarenal aorta was isolated
from surrounding tissue. all lumbar arteries in this
segment were ligated. an external iliac artery cutdown was performed for cannulation with a 24gauge angiocatheter (johnson johnson, arlington,
tx) to measure arterial blood pressure and heart
rate (micro-med, louisville, ky). the angiocatheter was exchanged for a pe-10 polyethylene catheter (vwr scientific products, bridgeport, nj)
threaded through the external iliac arteriotomy
until it rested in the isolated aortic segment. the
aorta was temporarily ligated proximally and distally and then perfused with a 2-ml elastase solution for 2 hr by use of a microinfusion pump
(harvard apparatus, s. natick, ma). after infusion,
the ligatures and catheter were removed and the
external iliac artery was ligated. the fascia was
sutured and skin wounds were stapled. the rats
recovered, were individually housed, and were
provided with standard rat chow and water ad lib.
the rats were re-explored on postoperative day 7
(pod-7). a 24-gauge angiocatheter was inserted
through an external iliac artery cutdown on the
contralateral hindlimb for arterial blood pressure

inos and cox inhibitors in suppression of aortic aneurysms 249

and heart rate measurement. through the midline
laparotomy, aortic diameter was measured, the
aorta was harvested, and the rat was euthanized.
all aortas were measured under physiologic conditions with pulsatile blood flow before and after
intraaortic elastase solution infusion and at the
time of re-exploration using an ocular micrometer
with 0.1-mm graduations  xxxd1891xxx  Â· power.
aortic infusion and drug administration
all rats received aortic infusion of 7 units of elastase
(sigma, st. louis, mo, product #e-1250, lot
79h76281, unit activity determined by succinylala-ala-ala-p-nitroanalide as substrate) mixed in 2
ml of sterile saline to induce aneurysm formation.
drugs were tested in two series of experiments
based on the route of drug administration. rats
were blindly randomized by animal care personnel.
drug treatments were started postoperatively on
the day of operation. one series consisted of animals that received 3 mg/kg rofecoxib (merck,
whitehouse station, nj), administered by oral gavage once a day, and control animals that received
water by gavage once a day. the second series
consisted of animals that received a daily 1-ml
subcutaneous injection of 1.6 mg/kg indomethacin
(merck), 1 mg/kg  xxxd21xxx  (calbiochem, san diego,
ca), or daily 1-ml subcutaneous saline injection.
the dosage of rofecoxib was recommended by
merck scientists. the id50 for rofecoxib has been
reported to be 1.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 0.74 mg/kg
for inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema,
carrageenan-induced paw hyperalgesia, and adjuvant-induced arthritis, respectively.14 the dosage
of indomethacin was based on reports by holmes et
al.4 and miralles et al.5 demonstrating that a 1.6
mg/kg dose of indomethacin results in prevention
or inhibition of elastase-induced aaa in the rat
model. the dose of  xxxd21xxx  was chosen as a midrange dose as found in the available literature.15-18
previous dosing of  xxxd21xxx  in rats ranged between
0.1 mg/kg to >10 mg/kg. the id50 of  xxxd21xxx  for
inhibition of the systemic induction of inos by
endotoxin was 1.2 mg/kg.15
biochemical analysis
aortic tissue from every animal underwent western blot analysis to assess enos, inos,  xxxg1440xxx , and
actin expression. at the time of harvest, the aorta
was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. tissue was
prepared by homogenizing samples with 5 m urea,
50 mm tris, and 25 mm dithiothreitol, with ph 7.4
for equivalent sample concentrations (weight/volume). the samples were mixed with electropho-

resis gel sample buffer, heated, and loaded onto

available standards were used on all gels for all
proteins of interest. the gels were run until the dye
front approached the gel edge. the proteins were
transferred to polyvivylidene difluoride (pvdf)
membrane (immobilon-p). membranes were
stained with ponceau to insure adequate and
equivalent protein loading onto the pvdf membrane. the membrane was blocked with 2% nonfat
powdered milk and then incubated with anti-enos
(transduction laboratories, lexington, ky;
1:2500), anti-inos (transduction laboratories;
1:2500), or anti- xxxg1440xxx  (labvision/neomarkers,
fremont, ca; 1:2500). additionally, all blots were
incubated with anti-actin (sigma chemicals;
1:750). the membrane was rinsed and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugate secondary
antibody. enhanced chemiluminescence was used
to detect the protein of interest and actin expression and arbitrary light units were used to quantify
protein levels. a digital camera was used for
chemiluminescence detection and western blot
analysis was consistent across multiple blots. actin
levels were used to standardize protein loading
assuming that the level of actin would be similar in
all aortic specimens.
total rna was extracted from aortas with the
trizol reagent (invitrogen). one microgram of rna
was used as template for cdna synthesis with
superscript ii reverse transcriptase (invitrogen).
real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis was carried out using the roche light cycler.
the following primer pairs were used:  xxxg1440xxx

sec, 55c annealing for 30 sec, and 72c elongation
for 30 sec. pcr products were detected in real time
using quantitect sybr green master mix (qiagen).
mrna copy numbers were estimated from the
crossover point in the linear portion of the amplification curve. values for  xxxg1440xxx  and inos mrna
in each sample were divided by the a-actin mrna
value in the samples to correct for rna recovery.
histologic evaluation
aortic specimens were immediately placed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin. specimens were dehy-

drated through graded ethanols and embedded in
paraffin. paraffin-embedded sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin and orcein-elastin.
the slides were viewed with a light microscope
equipped with a digital camera. elastin preservation and inflammation were quantified as described
previously.19 the slides were evaluated by three
independent observers who were blinded to the
treatment groups. for elastin scoring an analog
scale of 1 to 4 was used, with 1 equal to <25%
elastin remaining and 4 equal to >75% elastin remaining. for inflammation a scale of 1 to 4 was
used, with 1 being no inflammation and 4 being
severe inflammation.
hemodynamic evaluation
blood pressure and heart rate were measured at the
original operation and at pod-7 in the control,
indomethacin, and  xxxd21xxx  groups. an external
iliac artery cutdown was performed for cannulation
with a 24-gauge angiocatheter (johnson johnson)
and arterial blood pressure and heart rate were
directly measured (micro-med).
statistics
comparisons of aortic diameters and protein levels
were assessed using one-way analysis of variance
(anova) with bonferrini correction between
groups. a paired-sample t-test was used to compare
arterial blood pressure and heart rate at the time of
operation and reoperation. data are reported as
mean Â± standard error of the mean (sem). the
instat statistical program (graphpad software,
prism inc., san diego, ca) and sas statitistical
software package (sas institute inc., cary, nc)
were used for statistical calculations.

results
drug administration and aortic diameter
the cyclooxygenase inhibitors rofecoxib and indomethacin and the inos inhibitor  xxxd21xxx  were
tested for their effects on aneurysm growth in the
animal model. animals were treated in two series
of experiments, based on routes of drug administration (oral gavage: rofecoxib and water control;
subcutaneous injection: indomethacin,  xxxd21xxx ,
and saline control).
as shown in figures 1 and 2, there was no difference in the initial aortic diameters among the
groups. in addition, all groups displayed a similar
small increase in aortic diameter immediately after
infusion. elastase infusion produced aneurysms in

aortic diameter in both groups at day 7 (harvest). no
difference was noted in aortic diameter prior to or
immediately following infusion between the groups.
treatment with rofecoxib caused a trend toward decreased aneurysm size that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13). data are shown as mean Â± sem
with n = 8 per group.

fig. 2. aortic diameter in indomethacin-,  xxxd21xxx , and

groups at day 7 (harvest). treatment with  xxxd21xxx , a
selective inos inhibitor, significantly reduced aneurysm
size (p = 0.01) in comparison to the control group. mean
diameters in the indomethacin group were not significantly different from controls. data are shown as
mean Â± sem with n = 10 per group.

all groups as measured on pod-7. animals treated
with rofecoxib (fig. 1) had mean aneurysm sizes
that were smaller than those of the control group
(4.7 Â± 1.9 mm compared to 6.3 Â± 1.7 mm), but this
did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13).  xxxd2274xxx 
days after elastase infusion,  xxxd21xxx -treated animals
(fig. 2) exhibited significantly smaller aneurysms
(3.8 Â± 1.1 mm) than those of control animals
(5.6 Â± 0.9 mm) (p = 0.01). mean aortic diameters
of indomethacin-treated animals (5.3 Â± 1.3 mm)
were not significantly different from controls.

levels (fig. 3). similarly, no significant differences
in enos (fig. 4) or inos (fig. 5) steady-state levels
were noted between control,  xxxd21xxx -, or indomethacin-treated animals. variability in inos
expression among samples within groups was observed, consistent with our previous findings.3
indomethacin treatment produced a statistically
significant decrease in  xxxg1440xxx  steady-state levels (p
< 0.01) whereas  xxxd21xxx  did not (fig. 6). these effects were confirmed by quantitative pcr analysis
of inos and  xxxg1440xxx  mrna levels (fig. 7).

hemodynamic parameters
because hypertension is a positive risk factor for
aaa, and no, the product of inos, modulates
blood pressure, the effects of  xxxd21xxx  on heart rate
and blood pressure were measured. no statistical
differences were observed in heart rate or mean
arterial pressure between control, indomethacin-,
or  xxxd21xxx -treated groups at the time of infusion
(table i). on pod-7 all groups had significant increases in heart rate compared to preinfusion values. only the  xxxd21xxx -treated animals had a
statistically significant increase in blood pressure
compared to baseline values. the mean blood
pressure of the  xxxd21xxx  group (p < 0.4) was also
significantly elevated in comparison to the indomethacin and control groups on day 7.

hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated a
similar extent of inflammation among all groups on
pod-7 (fig. 8). inflammation extended through all
vessel layers  xxxd2274xxx  days in all groups. scoring of
inflammation (fig. 9) showed no significant difference among the groups.
elastin staining (fig. 8) showed preservation of
elastin in  xxxd21xxx -treated animals. scoring of elastin
preservation (fig. 9) showed significant preservation in  xxxd21xxx -treated animals compared to controls
(p = 0.01)
or

(p = 0.025) animals.

development. recent studies have documented an
increase in inos expression in both experimental
aneurysmal tissue as well as human aneurysmal
tissue.2,3,20 moderately selective inos inhibition
with  xxxd2951xxx  has been shown to decrease
aneurysmal size in the rat aaa model and the rat
cerebral aneurysm model.2,3,20 this study documents that highly selective inos inhibition with
 xxxd21xxx  significantly decreases aneurysm size and

preserves aortic elastin in the experimental rat
aneurysm model.
aneurysm production in the rat model has been
shown to depend on inflammatory modifiers
present to variable degrees in different elastase
preparations.19 a potential role for inflammation in
aaa formation in the animal model has led to
testing of various anti-inflammatory drugs as
agents to inhibit aneurysm growth. previous stud-

ies using indomethacin in the rat model have reported inhibition or prevention of aneurysmal
expansion.4,5 no studies have been published to
date demonstrating decreased experimental aneurysm size after selective cox-2 inhibition. in our
study neither indomethacin nor the cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib produced statistically significant decreases in aaa size in the animal model. our study
did, however, partially replicate previous data,
which demonstrated a significant decrease in
 xxxg1440xxx  and partial preservation of elastin in
indomethacin-treated rats. it is possible that with a
larger sample size our study could have detected a
significant decrease in aortic diameter in animals
treated with anti-inflammatory agents. differences

between our results and published reports on the
effects of indomethacin on aneurysm size could be
due in part to variability in the rat elastase model of
aaa. aneurysm development in this model depends on the production of an inflammatory response.19 different lots of commercial elastase
display widely different aneurysm-producing
activities. for example, in the study by miralles et
al,5 the mean diameter of the rat aorta in the
indomethacin group at 14 days was 3.45 mm. in
our study the mean diameter of the rat aorta in the
indomethacin group  xxxd2274xxx  days was 5.3 mm.
matrix metalloproteinases are associated with
extracellular matrix degradation and are elevated
in aaa.21-23 previous studies using doxycycline,24
indomethacin,4,5 and mmp inhibitors13,25 have
shown that inhibition of mmp activity in the rat
aneurysm model is associated with a decrease in
aneurysm size. most of these studies have also
shown that mmp inhibition results in preservation
of elastin with no effect on inflammatory infiltrate.4,5,24,25 our study using the broad-spectrum
mmp inhibitor bb94 demonstrated both a decrease
in inflammatory infiltrate as well as elastin preservation.13 the current study showed significant
reduction in  xxxg1440xxx  levels in rats treated with
indomethacin but not with  xxxd21xxx  or rofecoxib.
therefore, in our study the decrease in aneurysm
size produced by  xxxd21xxx  did not correlate with a
decrease in  xxxg1440xxx  expression; conversely, decreased  xxxg1440xxx  expression caused by indomethacin was not sufficient to cause decreased aneurysm
size. it is possible, however, that a larger sample
size might have demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in  xxxg1440xxx  expression with rofecoxib or  xxxd21xxx  in our study. these findings suggest
that while increased  xxxg1440xxx  activity plays a critical
role in aaa formation, other mechanisms also
contribute to this pathophysiologic process.
the underlying mechanisms responsible for decreased aneurysm size in animals treated with the
selective inos inhibitor are unknown.  xxxd21xxx  is an
inhibitor of inos enzyme activity, not inos
expression. therefore, a lack of a decrease in inos
mrna or protein levels in  xxxd21xxx -treated rats is
not surprising. in the rat aneurysm model, inos
expression is maximally elevated on day 1, followed by a steady decline. none of the treatments
produced a significant decrease in inos expression
as measured on day 7. the time course of inos
expression in this model may account for the variability observed in inos expression. no is a potent
regulatory molecule that activates the protein kinase g signaling cascade.26-29 no signaling has
been implicated in the regulation of inflamma-

tion,26,27,30-32 which is associated with aaa formation in the animal model. reactive byproducts
of no are also known to cause oxidative damage to
tissue.33,34 additional research will be needed to
determine the relative contributions of signaling
versus oxidative damage activities of no in aaa
formation. other drugs found to decrease experimental aneurysm formation, such as propranolol
and doxycycline, also decrease no production, like
 xxxd21xxx .35,36
lee et al.37 evaluated aaa formation in an inos
knockout mouse model. these authors conclude
that inos expression is not required for aaa formation in this mouse model. the apparently disparate results between the study by lee et al. and
the present study may be related to potential
compensatory mechanisms that have developed in
inos-deficient mice. there are also technical limitations to the use of animal models. thus, while
inos is not required for experimental aneurysm
formation in mice, as shown by the findings of lee

et al., our data strongly suggest that inos expression contributes to aneurysm expansion.
further evidence to support the role of inos and
no in aneurysm production comes from the finding that  xxxd2951xxx , a moderately selective
inos inhibitor, suppresses aneurysm formation in
the rat aaa model2,3 and rat cerebral aneurysm
model.20  xxxd2951xxx  and  xxxd21xxx  exhibit
similar mechanisms of action, and block binding of
the substrate arginine to the enzyme active site.
the main difference is the greater selectivity of
 xxxd21xxx  for inos over other nos isoforms.
hypertension is a clinical risk factor for aaa
expansion and rupture.38-41 suppression of aaa
expansion despite induction of hypertension in the
rat aaa model is counterintuitive but has been
replicated in studies using  xxxd2951xxx .2
additionally, in other studies treatment of hypertension did not effect aaa formation in  xxxg177xxx /enos double knockout mice.42 our
results demonstrate that the effects of no inhibitors

shown are mean Â± sem with n = 9 per group.

on aaa development are not caused by a reduction
in blood pressure.
this study demonstrates that suppression of
inos activity limits aneurysm expansion in the rat
model. the molecular mechanism by which inos
inhibition blocks aaa growth is unknown. our
data did not reveal an effect of inos inhibition on
 xxxg1440xxx  steady-state levels. inhibition of inos
activity could affect  xxxg1440xxx  activation or other
aspects of aneurysm formation. these results support further research into the role of no in aaa
formation.
