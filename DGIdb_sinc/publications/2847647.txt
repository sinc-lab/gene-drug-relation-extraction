hypothesized to act upon the mitochondrion of p. falciparum (5). p. knowlesi was found to contain small closed
circular dna molecules which appear to be mitochondrial in
origin (25). for these reasons, p. falciparum is potentially
susceptible to  xxxg2311xxx  inhibitors, such as the fluoroquinolones.
riou et al. (22) have characterized  xxxg2311xxx  from the
murine malaria species p. berghei. they concluded that
gyrase inhibitors were not good candidates for antimalarial
drugs, because the concentrations of known agents required
to inhibit the activity of  xxxg2311xxx  were too high and
appeared to be impractical for clinical use. however, these
investigators used a nonhuman malaria species and a methodology which may not have been adequate for the purification of  xxxg2311xxx  from mitochondria.
it has been shown previously that nalidixic acid inhibits
the growth of p. falciparum in vitro at approximately 10-5 to
10' m (5), suggesting that the fluoroquinolones might have
potential as antimalarial agents. the purpose of the present
experiments was to investigate the effects of several fluoroquinolone antibiotics and other  xxxg2311xxx  inhibitors on
both a chloroquine-susceptible and a chloroquine-resistant
strain of p. falciparum in vitro.
(preliminary results were presented at the 35th annual
meeting of the american society of tropical medicine,
denver, colo., 1986.)

the fluoroquinolones are a group of antibiotics structurally related to nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid (18, 24). both
agents have previously been used clinically for the treatment
of urinary tract infections. however, unlike nalidixic and
oxolinic acids, the fluoroquinolones achieve concentrations
in serum required for treatment of systemic infections even
when administered orally (18).
bacterial  xxxg2311xxx  ( xxxg2312xxx ) is inhibited by
several groups of antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones
(2, 3, 8, 15). the enzyme contains two a subunits and two b
subunits. the  xxxg220xxx  appears to be the primary target of
nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid, although other sites have
been found to be affected by these agents, including the b
subunit and single-stranded dna (19). the b subunits are
inhibited by  xxxd2757xxx  and coumermycin a1, antibiotics
which are not structurally related to the fluoroquinolones
(26).  xxxg2311xxx , which introduces negative superhelical
twists into double-stranded dna, is an important enzyme
for organisms such as bacteria and organelles such as
mitochondria, which contain circular dna (1).
four plasmodium species infect humans and are responsible for clinical malaria. plasmodiumfalciparum is the most
virulent and shows an increasing prevalence of resistance to
standard agents such as chloroquine, the basis of which is
not fully understood (20). p. falciparum contains a functional mitochondrion which is sensitive to a wide variety of
inhibitors (6). mitochondrial inhibitors, including the antibiotics which are specific for 70s ribosomes, are lethal for this
parasite (5, 12, 16). the 70s ribosome inhibitors display
distinct oxygen- and time-dependent toxicity and have been

the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are structurally related to nalidixic acid. their primary antibacterial action
appears to be mainly due to inhibition of  xxxg2311xxx  (dna  xxxg2312xxx ). we determined the activity of
several fluoroquinolones in vitro against two strains of plasmodiumfalciparum, fcc, (chloroquine susceptible)
and vns (chloroquine resistant). [3lh]hypoxanthine incorporation by malarial parasites was determined at 48
and 96 h. the molarity at which each agent caused a 50% decrease in the incorporation of [3h]hypoxanthine
compared with that of drug-free controls was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration. the fluoroquinolones evaluated were amifloxacin, ciprofloxacin,  xxxd1996xxx , norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and  xxxd2858xxx . other dna
gyrase inhibitors tested were nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid,  xxxd2757xxx , and coumermycin al. among the
fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin had the lowest 50% inhibitory concentrations at 48 h against both chloroquinesusceptible and -resistant strains of p. falciparum, (0.26 ± 0.08) x 10-4 and (0.38 ± 0.15) x 10-4 m,
respectively (mean + standard deviation).  xxxd1996xxx  had the lowest 50% inhibitory concentrations against
 xxxg1447xxx  and vns at 96 h, 0.23 x 10-5 and (0.06 ± 0.04) x 10-5 m, respectively. with the vns strain, fractional
inhibitory concentration indexes for the combination of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were calculated at 48 and
96 h to be 0.93 and 0.79, respectively, indicating modest additive effects. the combination of  xxxd2757xxx  with
ciprofloxacin showed indifference in the same system. the antimalarial effects of some fluoroquinolones occur
at achievable serum concentrations. whether inhibition of  xxxg2311xxx  contributes to the antimalarial activity
of the fluoroquinolones is unknown at present.

fluoroquinolone activity against p. falciparum

previously (10).
all antibiotics were initially dissolved in sterile normal
saline at concentrations of 10-2 m, except for coumermycin
a1, which was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx , and  xxxd2858xxx , which was dissolved in triple-distilled water. the 50%
inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) were defined as the drug
levels resulting in a 50% decrease in [3h]hypoxanthine
incorporation compared with drug-free controls; values were
obtained as described previously (5) from simple graphic
extrapolation and, as such, are only estimates. ic50s of each
antibiotic against each parasite at a given time interval are
the mean values obtained from three to six separate experiments. in this system, the ic50s of chloroquine at 48 h
against both  xxxg1447xxx  and vns are 3.2 x 10-9 and 10-7 m,
respectively (13).
catalog numbers (sigma chemical co.) and the molecular
weights of purchased antibiotics used in these experiments
were as follows: tetracycline hcl (t-3383; 180.9), nalidixic
acid (n-4382; 254.2), oxolinic acid (0-0877; 261.2),  xxxd2757xxx , sodium salt (n-1628; 634.6), and coumermycin a1
(c-9270; 1,110.1), all obtained from sigma chemical co. the
following fluoroquinolones (identifying number and molecular weight) were generous gifts: amifloxacin mesylate (win
49375-3; 430.4) from sterling-winthrop research institute,
rensselaer, n.y.; ciprofloxacin hci monohydrate (bay o

the chloroquine-resistant strain of p. falciparum.
of the four nonfluoroquinolone  xxxg2311xxx  inhibitors
tested, nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid, largely inhibitors of
the  xxxg220xxx  of bacterial  xxxg2311xxx , were the least active
against both strains of malaria.  xxxd2757xxx  and coumermycin a1, both inhibitors- of the b subunit of bacterial dna
gyrase, were the most active. ciprofloxacin was the most
active fluoroquinolone against both strains of p. falciparum.
however, against  xxxg1447xxx , ciprofloxacin was not significantly
different from amifloxacin;- against vns, it was not significantly different from either norfloxacin or  xxxd2858xxx  at 48 h.

w. trager of rockefeller university, new york, n.y.), and
viet nam smith (vns), a chloroquine-resistant organism
(obtained from l. perrin, university of geneva, geneva,
switzerland). experiments were performed in 96-well microdilution plates (limbro) as described previously (5, 11);
[3h]hypoxanthine (10 ci/mmol; new england nuclear
corp., boston, mass.) incorporation into parasites was used
to measure the effects of antibiotics (4). each well contained
2 pul of infected erythrocytes, 200 ,ul of rpmi 1640 medium
(gibco laboratories, grand island, n.y.) supplemented
with hepes (n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid; sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo.), sodium
bicarbonate, hypoxanthine (1.5 x 10-5 m), and 5% pooled
bovine serum (5, 7), with various antibiotic concentrations.
no antibiotics other than those being evaluated were added
to the medium, and exposure to drugs occurred for 48 and 96
h. in 48-h experiments, initial parasitemias were between 1.5
and 5%. to each well was added 1 ,uci of [3h]hypoxanthine,
and after 48 h of incubation, cells were collected on glassfiber filters with a skatron cell harvester. the filters were
dried, added to scintillation fluid (opti-fluor; united technologies packard, downers grove, ill.), and counted with a
scintillation spectrometer (beckman instruments, inc., fullerton, calif.) (5, 11).
in 96-h experiments, parasitemias were initially 0.25 to
1%. after 48 h, the supernatant was aspirated from each well
and replaced with medium containing the identical antibiotic
concentrations and 1 ,uci of [3h]hypoxanthine. microdilution plates were harvested as described above after an
additional 48 h of incubation. experiments were conducted
in candle jars containing approximately 15% 02, 2% c02,
and 84% n2. drug combinations were tested as described

showed significantly lower ic50s against vns, the chloroquine-resistant strain, when compared with ic50s against
 xxxg1447xxx .  xxxd1996xxx  was the most active fluoroquinolone against
both  xxxg1447xxx  and vns at 96 h, although its ic50 was not
significantly different from that of ciprofloxacin against
 xxxg1447xxx .
activity of ciprofloxacin against p. falciparum at increasing
levels of parasitemia. gluzman et al. (17) have investigated
the effect of inoculum size observed with chloroquine and p.
falciparum. increasing the number of parasitized erythrocytes in their test system 100-fold, they observed a five- to
sevenfold increase in the concentrations of chloroquine
required to produce a 50% inhibitory effect. this action was
associated with a depletion of chloroquine from the extracellular medium by parasitized erythrocytes (17). to determine whether the fluoroquinolones exhibited a similar effect,
we measured the ic50s of ciprofloxacin against p. falciparum
at levels of parasitemia ranging from 0.25 to 4.0%. table 1
shows the ic50s of ciprofloxacin against vns. the increasing parasitemia was not associated with an increase in
concentrations of ciprofloxacin required to produce 50%
inhibition. thus, the results did not suggest a depletion of
ciprofloxacin from the test medium as might be associated
with its accumulation within parasitized erythrocytes.
activity of ciprofloxacin in combination with tetracycline or
 xxxd2757xxx  against vns. the tetracyclines are inhibitors of
ribosomal protein synthesis which are effective against the
erythrocytic asexual stages of p. falciparum in this system
(5, 12). the combination of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline
was tested for its activity against vns. the fractional
inhibitory concentration (fic) of each antibiotic was determined as the ratio of ic50 of that drug used in combination/
ic50 of that drug used alone. two fics were calculated for
each combination of agents. from these, the fic index
(fix) was calculated as the numerical sum of the two fics.
the following criteria are defined: a fix ofc0.5, synergy;
a fix of >0.5 but <1.0, additive effects; a fix of >1.0 but
<2.0, indifferent effects; a fix of >2.0, antagonism. for the
combination of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline at 48 h against
vns, the fics were 0.32 and 0.61, respectively, giving a
calculated fix of 0.93. at 96 h, the corresponding fics
were 0.25 and 0.54, giving a fix of 0.79, indicating only
modest additive effects.

following 96-h exposure to each antibiotic are shown in fig.
1b. the results are also shown in order of increasing activity
against  xxxg1447xxx . of the four nonfluoroquinolone  xxxg2311xxx 
inhibitors, nalidixic acid was the least active and coumermycin a1 exhibited similar activity against both strains of p.
falciparum at 96 h. however, all six fluoroquinolones tested

have additive or synergistic effects, fic and fix were also
determined for this combination of 48 and 96 h. fixs were
1.20 at 48 h and 0.94 at 96 h. the results are indicative of
indifference at 48 h and a somewhat additive effect at 96 h.
there was no synergy demonstrated between these combinations of antibiotics when tested against vns.
discussion
nalidixic acid is a bacterial  xxxg2311xxx  inhibitor with
demonstrable antimalarial activity in this test system (5). in
bacteria, nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid appear to inhibit the
a subunits of the bacterial  xxxg2311xxx  ( xxxg2312xxx ).
 xxxd2757xxx  and coumermycin a1 are not structurally related
to the quinolones but appear to inhibit the b subunit of dna
gyrase (9, 26). the fluoroquinolones largely inhibit the a
subunit (3, 26). gyrases catalyze several reactions, including
the production of negative superhelical twists within circular
double-stranded dna in the presence of atp. in the absence of atp, dna is relaxed by  xxxg2311xxx , a process
which involves both dna breakage and rejoining (2, 3, 8, 14,
15, 24).
both mitochondria and bacteria contain circular dna,
suggesting both an evolutionary origin for mitochondria as a
separate symbiotic organism and the potential for dna
gyrase activity in this organelle. castora et al. (1) have
shown  xxxg2311xxx  activity within mammalian mitochondria. using nalidixic acid and other inhibitors of escherichia
coli  xxxg2311xxx , they have shown a decrease in the
formation of highly supercoiled dna, a finding consistent
with the presence of  xxxg2311xxx  in rat liver mitochondria.
riou et al. (22) have characterized nuclear dna topoisomerase obtained from a murine malaria species, p. berghei. these investigators concluded that  xxxg2311xxx  inhibitors were not good candidates as antimalarial agents because
the drug concentrations required to inhibit  xxxg2311xxx 
ranged from 125 to 500 ,ug/ml, levels not considered practical. however, they used a nonhuman malaria species and a
purification methodology which might have missed any
gyrase activity once present within mitochondria.
in the current experiments, we have demonstrated that six
fluoroquinolone antibiotics possess significant in vitro activity against both chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquineresistant strains of p.falciparum. the ic50s for ciprofloxacin
at 48 h against  xxxg1447xxx  and vns were (0.26 + 0.08) x 10' and
(0.38 ± 0.15) x 10' m (mean ± standard deviation), or
approximately 9.6 and 14.0 ,ug/ml, which are three to four
times the expected maximum serum concentrations used
clinically. however, after 96 h of exposure to the antibiotic,
the ic50s were 1.4 and 0.52 p.g/ml for the susceptible and
resistant strains, respectively, concentrations readily
achievable by the oral route. for example, the maximum
concentration of  xxxd1996xxx  reached following an oral dose of
600 mg is approximately 3.7 ,ug/ml, with a terminal half-life
of elimination from serum of 6.2 h (18). the ic50s for
 xxxd1996xxx  at 96 h against the  xxxg1447xxx  and vns strains were
approximately 0.8 and 0.2 ,ug/ml, respectively.
the current investigation demonstrated no significant difference in the activity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics against
the chloroquine-susceptible ( xxxg1447xxx ) and the chloroquineresistant (vns) strains of p.falciparum at 48 h. however, at
96 h all six fluoroquinolones showed significantly lower ic50s
against vns. the basis for this difference in susceptibility is
not known and was in clear distinction to results obtained
with the four nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics tested.
the basis for chloroquine resistance in falciparum malaria
is not fully understood but may be due to enhanced chloro-

fluoroquinolone activity against p. falciparum

quine efflux from parasites (20, 21). in addition, p. falciparum, like neoplastic cells, can develop multiple drug resistance to structurally unrelated agents. there are several
possible approaches to the problem of drug resistance.
martin et al. (21) have shown that verapamil, a calcium
channel blocker, reverses chloroquine resistance in p. falciparum at the same concentration (106 m) at which it
reverses multidrug resistance in cultured neoplastic cells,
and this might well be extrapolated to drug-resistant malaria
parasites.
results of our limited study demonstrate that all six tested
fluoroquinolones showed equivalent activity against one
chloroquine-susceptible and one chloroquine-resistant strain
of p. falciparum following 48-h exposure to these agents. at
96 h, the chloroquine-resistant strain (vns) was actually
more susceptible to these agents than the chloroquinesusceptible strain ( xxxg1447xxx ). although the mechanism involved
in this phenomenon is unknown, the data suggest that
fluoroquinolones be examined further in chloroquine-resistant malaria to determine whether they are capable of
circumventing the multidrug resistance problem. the findings suggest that fluoroquinolones might prove useful in the
treatment of chloroquine-resistant strains of p. falciparum.
in addition, when tested against the vns strain of p.
falciparum at increasing levels of parasitemia to 4 x 106
parasites per ml, there was no demonstrable increase in the
ic50 of ciprofloxacin. the data of gluzman et al. (17)
demonstrate that a defined amount of chloroquine (.2 pmol/
106 parasitized erythocytes) is required to inhibit parasite
growth. enhanced efflux of chloroquine from malaria parasites would render this system vulnerable and lead to chloroquine resistance. our results did not suggest depletion of
ciprofloxacin from the test medium, as would be associated
with an accumulation of drug within parasitized erythrocytes
(17).
as an indirect test of the mitochondrial gyrase hypothesis,
the combinations of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline or ciprofloxacin and  xxxd2757xxx  were examined for synergy. since
each of these agents possibly act upon a rate-limiting site
with the organelle, the combinations tested represented a
potentially synergistic regimen. although each combination
was only modestly additive at 96 h, the results do not
disprove this hypothesis. further use of the fluoroquinolones in combination with the more rapidly acting quinolinecontaining antimalarials is currently under investigation.
in summary, the fluoroquinolones are a group of newer
antibacterial agents structurally related to nalidixic acid and
oxolinic acid. unlike their predecessors, the fluoroquinolones can achieve the levels in serum required for treatment
of systemic infections, even when administered by the oral
route. results of these experiments with both chloroquinesusceptible and chloroquine-resistant strains of p. falciparum malaria suggest that the fluoroquinolone antibiotics may
prove useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of human
malaria, including chloroquine-resistant organisms. these
agents are known to inhibit bacterial  xxxg2311xxx  and may
well be acting upon similar enzyme systems in plasmodium
species. alternatively, the antimalarial effects of fluoroquinolones may be only partially related to, or even unrelated
to, inhibition of malarial  xxxg2311xxx  activity.
