olanzapine increases slow wave sleep and sleep continuity in ssri-resistant depressed patients.  the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine has been employed as an augmentation treatment in depressed patients unresponsive to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). in healthy subjects, acute olanzapine administration increases sleep continuity and enhances slow wave sleep (sws). the aim of the present study was to determine if the addition of olanzapine to ssri treatment in depressed patients produced similar effects on sleep.
