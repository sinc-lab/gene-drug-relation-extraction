there is an expanding field of research investigating the benefits of alternatives to current pharmacological therapies in psychiatry.
 xxxd68xxx  (nac) is emerging as a useful agent in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. like many therapies, the clinical origins
of nac are far removed from its current use in psychiatry. whereas the mechanisms of nac are only beginning to be understood, it is
likely that nac is exerting benefits beyond being a precursor to the antioxidant, glutathione, modulating glutamatergic, neurotropic and
inflammatory pathways. this review outlines the current literature regarding the use of nac in disorders including addiction, compulsive
and grooming disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  xxxd68xxx  has shown promising results in populations with these disorders, including those in whom treatment efficacy has previously been limited. the therapeutic potential of this acetylated amino acid is
beginning to emerge in the field of psychiatric research.

historical use of  xxxd68xxx 
 xxxd68xxx  (nac) has been used as an antioxidant precursor to glutathione ( xxxd2213xxx ; gsh) in
the treatment of paracetamol overdose for more than
30 years.1 as more is understood about the actions of nac,
the clinical applications have also broadened.  xxxd68xxx 
is now widely used as a mucolytic and in the treatment
of hiv, and it has reported efficacy in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and contrast-induced nephropathy.2 specific to brain disorders, nac has been trialled with some efficacy in patients with  xxxg178xxx .3 the present review
will explore the role of nac in the treatment of psychiatric
conditions and the possible mechanisms of benefit for these
disorders.

role in oxidative homeostasis
the use of nac in restoring gsh levels is well established
(fig. 1). glutathione is the primary endogenous antioxidant.
glutathione neutralizes reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
from the cell through both direct and indirect scavenging. as

the most abundant and ubiquitous antioxidant, it is responsible for maintaining the oxidative balance in the cell. this occurs through both direct removal of reactive species through
the formation and breakdown of adducts and is also catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase (gpx) in a nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)–dependent reaction. the resulting  xxxd2811xxx  is then reduced by
 xxxg981xxx  to begin the cycle again.4 glial cells
contain much higher levels of gsh than neuronal cells and
support neuronal gsh production. astrocytes release gsh
into the extracellular space and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase
breaks down gsh to a cysteine–glycine dipeptide and glutamate. the dipeptide is hydrolyzed to glycine and cysteine,
and all 3 amino acids are then available for neuronal gsh
synthesis. neuronal gsh production is believed to be primarily mediated by astrocytic gsh release, and astrocytic
gsh production is rate-limited by cysteine and the enzyme
glutamate–cysteine ligase.4,5
in addition to providing cysteine for gsh production,
nac has been shown to scavenge oxidants directly, particularly the reduction of the hydroxyl radical, ·oh and
hypochlorous acid.6

 xxxd68xxx  in psychiatry

oral administration of gsh alone does not adequately restore gsh levels. it is rapidly hydrolyzed by the liver and intestines,7 and penetration through the blood–brain barrier is
poor. similarly, oral administration of l-cysteine has also
been shown to have little effect on brain gsh levels owing to
first-pass metabolism.8–10 oral nac administration results in
increased plasma cysteine levels, ultimately leading to increases in plasma gsh.11,12  xxxd68xxx  has been shown
to successfully penetrate the blood–brain barrier and raise
brain gsh levels in animal models,13–15 which may be relevant

to psychiatry, where alterations in brain gsh and other redox pathways have been shown.

interaction with inflammatory mediators
alterations in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (il)-6,  xxxg1170xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx 
(tnf)–alpha, have been reported in populations with depression,
and to a lesser extent, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.16,17
these inflammatory cytokines are potential contributors

fig. 1: mechanisms of action of  xxxd68xxx  (nac). top to bottom: increased activity of cystine–glutamate antiporter results in increased
activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors on inhibitory neurons and facilitates vesicular dopamine release; nac is associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and acts as a substrate for glutathione synthesis. these actions are believed to converge upon mechanisms promoting cell survival and growth factor synthesis, leading to increased neurite sprouting. bdnf = brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx ;

to the underlying pathophysiology of these disorders.
 xxxd68xxx  has been shown to have anti-inflammatory
properties (fig. 1) that are linked to oxidative pathways,
which may provide another potential mechanism of action in
the benefits of nac in psychiatry.
 xxxd68xxx  has been shown to reduce il-6 levels in
hemodialysis patients,18 although no change in these levels
were reported following nac treatment in a rat model of
traumatic brain injury.19 conversely, increased tnf-alpha and
 xxxg1170xxx  levels were reduced following nac treatment in rat
models of both traumatic brain injury and focal cerebral
ischemia.19,20  xxxd68xxx  has also been shown to improve outcomes in lipopolysaccharide models of inflammation. pretreatment with nac prevented oxidative stress and
loss of long-term potentiation following exposure to prenatal
inflammation.21 furthermore, lipopolysaccharide treatment
results in inhibited oligodendroglial cell development and
myelination that is attenuated by nac administration in rat
mixed glial cultures.22
the reductions in inflammatory cytokines by nac treatment may be a potential mechanism by which nac modulates the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. this may be directly associated with the inflammatory pathway, or working
through oxidative processes associated with inflammation.
further research is required to elucidate these mechanisms.

effects on neurotransmission
glutamate
in addition to the effects on oxidative balance, alterations in
cysteine levels have also been shown to modulate neurotransmitter pathways, including glutamate and dopamine
(da; fig. 1).23,24 cysteine assists in the regulation of neuronal
intra- and extracellular exchange of glutamate through the
cystine–glutamate antiporter. whereas this antiporter is ubiquitous throughout all cell types, in the brain it is preferentially located on glial cells.25 the dimer, cystine, is taken up
by astrocytes and exchanged for glutamate, which is released
into the extracellular space. this free glutamate appears to
stimulate inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors on
glutamatergic nerve terminals and thereby reduce the synaptic release of glutamate.26 given that relation, the amount of
cysteine in the system as well as the feedback via gsh production by neurons may directly regulate the amount of glutamate present in the extracellular space. furthermore, gsh
itself has been shown to potentiate brain n-methyl- d aspartate receptor response to glutamate in rats.27,28 changes
in the levels of neuronal gsh may not only alter available
glutamate levels, but also have direct consequences on glutamatergic function.

dopamine
in addition to modulating glutamate levels through the
cystine–glutamate antiporter, nac has also been shown to
alter da release. following amphetamine treatment to rat
striatal slices, nac has been shown to facilitate vesicular da

80

release at low doses in striatal neurons and inhibit release at
millimolar concentrations. 29 in monkeys, nac has been
shown to protect against reductions in  xxxg2149xxx  levels
following repeated methamphetamine administration,30 suggesting one mechanism whereby increased da release was
facilitated in the previous study. glutathione has also been
shown to increase glutamate agonist–evoked da release in
mouse striatal neurons.23

use in psychiatry
there is a growing body of literature exploring the use of
nac in the treatment of psychiatric illness. there is provisional evidence of the potential benefit of nac in a wide
range of disorders. many of these disorders have limited
treatment options or suboptimal outcomes with current treatments. the present review outlines the clinical use of nac in
psychiatry (summary in table 1).

addiction
there is an abundance of literature implicating glutamatergic
abnormalities in addiction.47,48 more recently, data are emerging suggesting a role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of addiction to drugs of abuse.32,49–51 research has explored
the modulation of glutamatergic pathways by nac in preclinical models.52,53  xxxd68xxx  has been shown to reverse
the decline in cystine–glutamate exchange through the
cystine–glutamate antiporter and thereby assist in the restoration of glutamatergic pathways in addiction.32,52 these properties have made it a potential prospect for the treatment of addiction. much of the following literature is based on small
clinical trials, nonrandomized cohorts or case reports, but is
sufficiently promising to suggest the need for larger well designed studies.
marijuana dependence
a recent study by gray and colleagues31 investigated the use
of nac (2400 mg/d) in an open-label study of 24 dependent
marijuana users who reported an interest in reducing their
use. following treatment, users reported reductions in
days/week of use and “number of hits.” conversely, urine
cannabinoid measures did not significantly change over the
treatment period, although the authors state that urine
cannabinoid levels in 13 users remained higher than the detection range of the test, thus providing ambiguous results
regarding decreases in use. in addition to overall use, reductions in reported compulsivity, emotionality and purposefulness regarding marijuana use (measured with the marijuana
craving questionnaire) were reported, reflecting an improvement in 3 of the 4 domains of the scale.31
nicotine addiction
 xxxd68xxx  has also been investigated as a treatment for
nicotine addiction. in addition to the modulation of glutamate to reduce cravings and reward behaviours, nac may
have a role as an antioxidant in a disorder where oxidative
stress is marked. there has been 1 placebo-controlled study

(n = 29) investigating 2400 mg/day of nac as a treatment for
tobacco cessation.32 this study recorded participant ratings of
use and cravings as well as biochemical measures to confirm
reported use. there was no significant difference in the number of cigarettes smoked or carbon monoxide levels between
nac and placebo groups. treatment adherence and side effects were not reported. the authors noted that alcohol was a
significant covariate, and after the removal of 2 outliers based
on alcohol consumption and resulting nicotine use, there was
only a post hoc trend toward decreased number of cigarettes
smoked in the nac group, and this did not correspond with
decreased carbon monoxide levels. owing to the exclusion of
participants from the analysis and the variability of the sample in terms of extraneous factors such as alcohol use, the
sample size of this study was too small to make definitive
conclusions.
there is another small-scale study that specifically included smokers who were not planning on quitting that investigated biomarkers in smokers after nac treatment.33 the
outcome of the study was to assess the effects of nac on the
detrimental biophysical aspects of smoking. participants
were randomly assigned to placebo or nac (1200 mg/d)
groups and treated for 6 months. the study found that in the
nac group, there were decreases in lipophilic dna adducts
between baseline and end point. also, 8-oh-dg levels were
decreased both between baseline and end point, and compared to the placebo group. these data indicate a decrease in
dna damage over the course of the study. additionally,
there was a decreased number of micronuclei present in oral
mucosa in the nac group after treatment when compared
with baseline.
cocaine addiction
in a small crossover study (n = 13), designed to determine
tolerability and safety, participants (currently abstaining
from cocaine use) were given 2400 mg of nac or placebo
over 2 days.34 four days later, participants were crossed over
to the alternative arm. whereas there was no between-group
change in reduction of cravings compared with placebo, the
within-group analysis showed that the nac group had a significant reduction in cravings, withdrawals and self-reported
use compared with baseline, which was not seen in the
placebo group. whereas this study did not aim to investigate
efficacy, a signal was found that provided some evidence to
justify further research.
in a follow-up study, a similar sample was treated with
2400 mg of nac.35 results of this study showed that, based
on cue-reactivity slides, nac reduced the desire for and interest in cocaine, and also reduced the amount of time spent
looking at the cocaine-related slides.
after these studies, this research group went on to conduct
a larger open-label trial of nac using 3 doses over 4 weeks.36
initially, 8 participants received 1200 mg/day of nac. after
the establishment of tolerability at this dose, a further 9 participants received 1800 mg/day of nac, and finally 6 participants received 3600 mg/day of nac. although not statistically significant, this study found reductions in the amount
spent on cocaine, the number of days of use and improve-

82

ments based on the cocaine selective severity assessment.
the researchers noted that this study was underpowered and
required a placebo-controlled design to make concrete assertions regarding the efficacy of nac in the treatment of cocaine addiction. considering these results, larger well designed trials are required.
pathological gambling
in an open-label study involving 29 participants with a confirmed pathologic addiction to gambling, grant and colleagues37 administered 1800 mg (titrated dose) of nac over
8 weeks. a randomized trial of 13 responders was then conducted over the following 6 weeks (constant dose of
1800 mg/kg of nac compared with placebo). during the
open-label study, 16 participants experienced significant reductions in gambling behaviour. of those, 13 agreed to take
part in the randomized study. following a further 6 weeks of
nac treatment, 83% of the nac group was still considered
responders, with only 28% in the placebo group.

obsessive–compulsive disorder
similarities exist among brain regions implicated in addiction
and obsessive–compulsive disorder (ocd), including the
nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate cortex.54,55 there
have been reports of oxidative stress in populations with
ocd, including increased lipid peroxidation;56–59 decreased
 xxxd3521xxx ,58 catalase, gpx and selenium;59 increased superoxide
dismutase;59 and changes in overall oxidative status.60 some of
these alterations have been linked to symptom severity.57,59
standard first-line therapies for ocd generally include a
combination of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (sris) and psychotherapy. whereas there is some efficacy with this treatment regimen, up to 20% of individuals with ocd are
treatment-resistant and derive little benefit.61 there is some
evidence to suggest glutamatergic abnormalities in individuals with ocd; however, further characterization is required
to determine if this is a primary, causal effect or a by-product
of hypermetabolism and altered neurotransmission in other
pathways.62
at present, there is only 1 case report regarding the use of
nac in patients with ocd.38 this report showed notable
benefits in an individual who was treatment-refractory. the
participant experienced partial benefit from treatment with
fluvoxamine, and continued fluvoxamine during a 13-week
trial of 3 g of nac (including dose titration to 3 g). during
the course of the trial, the participant improved on both
yale–brown obsessive compulsive scale and hamilton rating scale for depression scores. continued treatment with
fluvoxamine and nac led to dramatic improvements in control of compulsive washing and obsessional triggers.

trichotillomania and grooming disorders
a spectral relation between ocd and trichotillomania (ttm)
is described, and there is reported efficacy of sris in ttm, as
with ocd.63 however, the response to treatment with sris in
individuals with ttm is inconsistent.64 comparisons between

j psychiatry neurosci 2011;36(2)

nacetyl-dean_jpn template 10/02/11 1:42 pm page 83

 xxxd68xxx  in psychiatry

ttm and addictive disorders have also been made, given that
impulsivity and dysfunctional reward pathways may be operative in both types of disorder, and there has been some benefit in treating ttm with opioid antagonists.65 trichotillomania
may have a heterogeneous nature, with one subgroup more
similar to ocd and another subgroup more similar to addiction.66 two case studies suggested benefits of nac treatment
in individuals with ttm.39 the first involved a 28-year-old
man and the second a 40-year-old woman. these authors reported that 1800 mg of nac (titrated over a period of several
weeks) ameliorated hair pulling.
there has been 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
nac for the treatment of ttm.40 in this study, 50 individuals
(45 women and 5 men) were given 1200 mg of nac or
placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a further 6 weeks of
2400 mg of nac or placebo. half of the sample was concurrently taking medication, including sris, serotoninnoradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and stimulants. four participants were undergoing psychotherapy.  xxxd68xxx 
was administered in combination with these treatments.
over the course of the study, nac treatment was found to
decrease symptoms of ttm compared with placebo. most
(88%) of the participants completed the 12-week study. effects of treatment were seen at week 9 and continued
throughout the remainder of the study. overall, nac
seemed to be efficacious in the treatment of ttm.
in addition to ttm, promising preliminary results suggest
the need for controlled studies in other grooming disorders,
including nail biting and skin picking.39,41 a case report was
published regarding an individual with both ttm and nail
biting behaviours, in whom nail biting ceased following
9 weeks of nac treatment.39 the participant relapsed after a
hiatus in treatment, but recommencement of nac resulted in
a remission of symptoms.39 a serendipitous finding of the
benefit of nac treatment in the reduction of nail biting in a
study primarily investigating nac (2000 mg/d) in the treatment of mood disorders has been reported.41 three participants taking nac reported significant reductions in nail
biting during the 6-month course of treatment. all 3 participants were still abstinent from nail biting 1 month after the
discontinuation of nac.
finally, there is a case report regarding skin picking and
nac treatment. 39 in a woman who was not receiving
pharmacological interventions, 600 mg/day of nac was administered. over the subsequent 4 weeks, the dose was increased to 1800 mg/day, after which both urge and actual
behaviours regarding skin picking had completely remitted.

schizophrenia
dopaminergic abnormalities have historically been in the foreground as research targets for schizophrenia, although all other
major neurotransmitter systems, including gamma-aminobutyric
acid, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate and noradrenaline have also been implicated.65 increased dopaminergic
metabolism in the striatum has been reported. this hyperdopaminergic state has been shown to inversely correlate
with hypodopaminergia in the prefrontal cortex. these

changes are believed to mediate alterations in executive function and many of the positive symptoms of the disorder.
in populations with schizophrenia, dysfunction in glutamate metabolism and decreased glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex have been reported.68 the addition of cysteine
has been shown to modulate glutamate levels through
glutamate–cystine exchange, and gsh has been shown to
modulate the binding of glutamate to n-methyl-d-aspartate
receptors.69  xxxd68xxx  may be beneficial in the treatment of schizophrenia by targeting both oxidative stress and
glutamatergic dysfunction, suggesting that the phenotype is
a result of interactions of multiple neurotransmitter pathways70 that interact with oxidative and inflammatory systems, which are additionally implicated in the disorder.
there is an expanding body of evidence suggesting oxidative stress occurs in individuals with schizophrenia, and
there are links between oxidative stress symptom severity
and diagnostic subtype.45,71–74 whether the effects are synchronous with altered neurotransmission or the result of
these abnormalities requires further research. evidence for a
role of oxidative stress in populations with schizophrenia
includes polymorphisms in key gsh pathway genes and altered levels of antioxidants (with correlations between levels
and severity of symptoms).75 oxidative stress may lead to
changes in lipid membranes, mitochondrial dysfunction and
alterations to dna and proteins. in individuals with schizophrenia, it is believed that whereas there are few changes to
neuronal cell bodies, connections and dendritic sprouting
may be affected. this is one potential mechanism by which
oxidative stress is involved in this disorder. similarly,
changes in mitochondrial function have been reported, and
the link to energy generation may provide a clue to the
underlying pathology of schizophrenia. moreover, links between oxidative stress and neurotransmission in psychiatric
illnesses are beginning to be identified.
a large-scale study investigating nac as an adjunctive
therapy for schizophrenia has been conducted,42 which employed a 1000 mg, bi-daily regimen (compared with placebo)
in addition to existing medication over 6 months. in all,
140 participants took part in this double-blind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial. of these, 60% completed the
6-month treatment trial. improvements were seen in the
negative symptoms, measured on the positive and negative
symptoms scale. furthermore, improvements in global function and improved abnormal movements, particularly
akathisia, were also reported. these effect sizes were moderate, and improvements were lost 1 month after the discontinuation of treatment. this sample was considered treatment-refractory, with the average duration of illness being
12 years and more than 60% of participants medicated with
clozapine. given this, the outcomes of the addition of nac
are noteworthy. gastrointestinal side effects were most commonly reported; however, the nac and placebo groups did
not differ statistically.
these findings were further supported by qualitative
analysis of participants’ data. in this report, using a novel
methodology, qualitative analysis of patient reports and
clinician observations was performed in a blinded manner,

dean et al.

and the nac and placebo groups were compared. emerging
themes showed that participants treated with nac demonstrated improvements in insight, self-care, social interaction,
motivation, volition, psychomotor stability and stabilization
of mood.76 in a subset of the primary study, nac appeared to
modulate auditory sensory processing, measured using mismatch negativity, a marker of glutamatergic function and an
endophenotype of psychosis. compared with healthy controls, individuals with schizophrenia were shown to have reduced mismatch negativity at baseline. following 8 weeks of
nac treatment (2000 mg/d), mismatch negativity was
shown to improve significantly.12 a recent case report has
also shown significant improvements in symptoms following
600 mg/day of nac in a young woman with treatmentresistant schizophrenia. however, details of total length of
treatment are not provided.43

bipolar disorder
alterations in oxidative metabolism have also been described
in populations with bipolar disorder.61,77 similar to schizophrenia, changes in antioxidant levels, increased markers of
lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation have all been
reported. these changes appear to be related to state, particularly in mania, where increased oxidative stress seems to be
apparent. this is congruent with reports of hyperdopaminergic states during manic episodes.46 furthermore, links between oxidative status and duration of illness have also been
found.78
a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
nac in 75 participants with bipolar disorder was conducted. 44 this 6-month trial involved the addition of
2000 mg/d of nac or placebo to treatment as usual. over
the 6-month period there was no difference between groups
in drop-out rates, with 64% of the total sample completing
the trial. rating scores on the montgomery–åsberg depression rating scale (madrs) and the bipolar depression rating scale showed large decreases in depressive symptoms
(about 9 points on the madrs between nac and placebo
groups at the end point). akin to the schizophrenia trial, improvements were seen on global improvement, severity and
function scales; however, these effects were proportionally
larger, with large effect sizes on most measures. again, after
discontinuation of nac treatment, there was a convergence
with scores between the nac and placebo groups, showing a
loss of benefit following washout.

discussion
 xxxd68xxx  appears to be promising in the treatment of
several psychiatric disorders. many of the psychiatric disorders discussed have shown only preliminary data regarding the efficacy of nac in their treatment, and further research is required. however, nac appears to be a promising
therapeutic target and provides a window of treatment opportunity in a field where current treatments are limited or
have remained suboptimal.
the apparent lack of specificity of nac in initial studies is

84

intriguing and suggests that it may be targeting pathways
that are common across disorders; oxidative stress appears to
be a fairly nonspecific finding in a range of psychopathologies, and dysregulation of glutamate, inflammatory pathways and da are similarly widely reported. given that the
current diagnostic systems are phenomenologically based,
and that in no other branch of medicine are phenomenology
and pathophysiology linearly linked, this may reflect an intrinsic limitation of our classification system. this is highlighted by the fact that there is extensive overlap of other
treatments and biomarkers across disorders. as the body of
evidence is currently provisional for many disorders, as the
evidence base expands, it is possible that the efficacy will appear to be greater in some areas than others. additionally,
the precise dose of nac remains to be definitively established. dose-finding studies may reveal greater efficacy at
higher doses or equal efficacy at lower doses. whereas the
tolerability profile of nac appears benign, it needs to be
stressed that there is no extensive evidence base with longerterm use. some adverse events, such as pulmonary hypertension are reported in very high-dose animal studies, but have
not been seen in human studies.79 whereas nac appears to
be antiepileptic at low doses,80 seizures are reported with
overdose.81 vigilance is necessary.
given that many of these disorders have many interacting
potential pathophysiological pathways, further research is required to determine how nac is exerting benefits. biomarker and neuroimaging platforms have the capacity to
illuminate these issues. in disorders such as addiction, glutamate has been the primary candidate for the mechanism of
action, whereas in schizophrenia and mood disorders, the
gsh hypothesis has been the one postulated as explaining
the mechanism of action of nac. however, given the interaction between glutamate, the most abundant neurotransmitter, and other neurotransmitter pathways, including da and
serotonin, individuals with disorders such as depression and
schizophrenia may benefit by indirect modulation of these
pathways through changes in glutamatergic function. a common link in treatment efficacy may be oxidative stress, which
has been shown to be altered in most of these disorders.
however, in cocaine addiction, most of the research focusing
on mechanisms of action has implicated the modulation of
the cystine–glutamate antiporter by nac as the most likely
cause of benefit.26,82,83 whereas there are similarities across
these disorders with alterations to oxidative biology and
neurotransmission, and changes in glutamate-dependent
long-term potentiation and neuronal plasticity,84 perhaps the
heterogeneity of the underlying pathologies, especially in
brain regions implicated, may lead to the revelation of different actions of nac depending on the disorder.
similarly, the modulation of inflammatory pathways may
also play a role in the benefits seen following nac treatment.
the role of inflammation in depression has received the
greatest attention; however, inflammatory pathways are implicated in the etiology of other disorders, such as schizophrenia. as with the atypical antipsychotics, which have new
data showing a diversity of mechanisms of action, including
on inflammation,85 brain-derived neurotrophic factor86 and

 xxxd68xxx  in psychiatry

oxidative stress,87 efficacy may turn out to be a summative
interaction of effects on various pathways.
overall this unlikely therapeutic tool is implicating novel
pathways as viable therapeutic targets. this opens the way
for the development of other rational, hypothesis-based therapies. that nac appears safe, tolerable and affordable and is
readily available adds to its interest.
