intolerance reactions to acetyl  xxxd3159xxx  (asa) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are common and caused by inhibition of
cox-1 enzyme. therefore, drugs that selectively inhibit cox-2 enzyme may be safe in these subjects. in this study, we evaluated the tolerability of
celecoxib, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, in patients with analgesic intolerance. the eligible study population consisted of patients with a history of
urticaria/angioedema, naso-ocular symptoms, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by asa and/or nsaids. a single-blind,
placebo-controlled oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting. on 2 separate days, 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo and celecoxib
(celebrex 200 mg, pfizer, turkey) were given with 2-hour intervals. seventy-five subjects (mean age: 38.2 ± 1.4 years; f:m: 55:20) were included
in the study. twenty-one subjects had asthma. no reaction was observed with placebo or celecoxib provocation. although celecoxib seems to be a
safe alternative drug in our study group, considering its serious adverse events reported in the literature, the drug should be recommended for
patients with analgesic intolerance only after being tested by an experienced allergist.

i ntroduction
 xxxd234xxx  (asa) and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) have been reported to induce
mild to severe adverse reactions including pruritus,
urticaria, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis in subjects with
analgesic intolerance (ai) (1). these drugs act by inhibiting
the activities of the cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and cox-2
enzymes. inhibition of cox-1 enzyme has been suggested
to initiate the intolerance reactions (1–3). the inhibition
of cox-1 enzyme leads to a decrease in the formation
of pge2, which is known to have an inhibitory effect on
cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) release (4). it has been
suggested that the lack of this inhibitory effect of pge2 on
cyslt release is one of the main mechanisms underlying
the pathogenesis of ai (4).
cox-2 inhibitors are suggested to protect the pge2
formation and thereby prevent adverse reactions in intolerant subjects. although drugs that preferentially inhibit
the cox-2 enzyme, such as  xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx ,
have been reported to be safe in the majority of subjects
with ai, up to 13% of analgesic intolerant subjects demonstrated adverse reactions to these drugs due to partial
inhibition of the cox-1 isoenzyme (5–11). in this context,
theoretically, drugs that do not inhibit the cox-1 enzyme
but inhibit cox-2 enzyme selectively may be safe in
subjects with ai. supporting this data in clinical practice,
there are increasing reports about the safer use of new
selective cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib in patients with ai

(10–14). a recently introduced nsaid, celecoxib, a 4-(5(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)- xxxd3045xxx )
benzene sulfonamide, has a selective inhibitory effect on
cox-2 isoenzyme without any effect on cox-1 isoenzyme
(15, 16). there are only a few studies demonstrating the
tolerability of celecoxib in asa/nsaids intolerant
subjects (17–24). in this study, we aimed to detect the
tolerability of celecoxib in analgesic-intolerant patients.
m aterials and methods
patient selection
the study was carried out in our tertiary clinic located in
ankara, the capital city of turkey. the eligible study group
was selected among patients with a reliable history of
urticaria/angioedema, naso-ocular symptoms, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by asa
and/or nsaids on two separate occasions.
patients taking antihistamines, systemic corticosteroids,
 xxxd1763xxx , sympathomimetics, or b-blocker drugs during
the preceding week, having a history of sensitivity to
lactose, sulfonamides, and having active urticaria and/or
rash were not included in the study. asthmatic patients
were eligible for the study if their asthma was stable for at
least 2 weeks and having a fev1 value over 70% predicted.
they were allowed to continue their maintenance therapy
with inhaled corticosteroids.
after inclusion to the study, age, sex, duration of ai,
implicated analgesic(s), reaction patterns, number of the
drug(s) inducing reactions, were recorded. presence of comorbid disorders, such as rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis,
and chronic urticaria, were also evaluated. asthma was
diagnosed by the presence of recurrent symptoms of
wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and demonstration
of objective sign of reversible airway obstruction as stated

f igure 1.—divided doses of placebo (lactose) and celecoxib (celebrex 200 mg, pfizer, turkey) were given on 2 separate days.

by the american thoracic society (25). sensitivity to other
drugs was diagnosed by the reliable history of igemediated reactions (urticaria/angioedema, bronchospasm,
laryngeal edema, rhinitis), and systemic anaphylactoid
reactions involving hypotension, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm and/or shock and presence of non-ige-mediated
reactions (maculopapular eruption, fixed drug eruption,
photosensitivity, contact dermatitis, and other reactions) to
a prescribed drug. all patients gave written informed
consent prior to the drug challenge.
oral challenge tests
oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting.
the challenge protocol consisted of oral administration of
the drug with increasing doses. the study was designed as
a single-blind and placebo-controlled oral drug challenge.
on 2 separate days, 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo
(lactose) and the active drug, celecoxib (celebrex 200 mg,
pfizer, turkey) were given with 2-hour intervals (figure 1).
during the challenge procedure, blood pressure, forced
expiratory volume in 1-second (fev1) values, skin, ocular,
nasal, and bronchial reactions were monitored after each
placebo or active drug dose. patients were followed up to
24 hours to detect a delayed reaction. patients were

accepted as celecoxib tolerant if no reaction was observed
in the 24 hours following the oral challenge.
oral challenge test was accepted positive if one of the
following symptoms existed: conjunctival reaction; upper
and lower respiratory tract reactions such as sneezing,
rhinorrhea, nasal blockage, dyspnea, wheezing, and cough
with a 20% decrease in fev1; cutaneous reactions such
as erythema, pruritus with erythema, urticaria/angioedema; and/or anaphylactoid reaction with urticaria and/
or angioedema and hypotension (a 30 mmhg drop in
systolic blood pressure) and/or laryngeal edema. in the
presence of positive reaction to the drug, the oral challenge test was stopped.
evaluation of atopy
atopy was defined as a positive skin prick test (spt) to
at least one of the aeroallergens. glycerinate extracts
(stallergenes, france) of the following allergenic sources
were used in spts: dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, d
farinae, grass, tree, weed pollens, cat, dog, alternaria and
cladosporium antigens. positive histamine and negative
(saline solution) controls were included. the puncture
method was used, and a mean wheal diameter of 3 mm or
greater than control solution was considered positive.

statistical analysis
numeric results were expressed as means ± standard
error of mean (sem). nominal variables were expressed as
percentage of the patients. the statistical package for
social sciences (spss) for windows version 10.0 was used
to analyze the data.
r esults
patients
seventy-five subjects were included in the study.
demographic data of the study group is given in table 1.
for comorbid disorders, 30 subjects (40.3%) appeared to be
previously healthy, and 2 subjects (2.7%) had chronic
urticaria. twenty-one subjects had asthma. baseline fev1
had a mean of 2.4 ± 0.2 l in patients with asthma (table 1).
spt analysis was performed in 49 subjects, and atopy
ratio was 34.7% in the study group. for the underlying
disorders, atopy rates were 23.5% and 38% in previously
healthy subjects and those with asthma, respectively.
characteristic features of analgesic intolerance
a detailed clinical presentation of asa/nsaids intolerance is given in table 2. twenty-three (30.7%) and 52
(69.3%) subjects described intolerance reactions to single
and multiple analgesics, respectively; 50.6% (n = 38) and
78.6% (n = 59) of the subjects were intolerant to asa and
nsaids, respectively.
in terms of the reaction pattern to asa/nsaids,
cutaneous reactions were the most common presentation
in 53 subjects (70.6%) followed by respiratory reactions in
23 subjects (30.6%). ten subjects (13.3%) described
reactions to other drugs in addition to asa/nsaids.
sensitivity to antimicrobial drugs was present in 8 subjects.
for reaction patterns according to comorbid diseases,
asthmatic subjects developed mostly respiratory reactions
to asa/nsaids (71.4%), whereas subjects with urticaria
and those without any history of allergic diseases except
drug allergy reported mostly cutaneous reactions (80% and
100%, respectively).

celecoxib provocation
no reaction was observed with placebo and celecoxib provocation.
d iscussion
in the current study, we demonstrated that celecoxib
was well tolerated in patients with ai. there are only a
few reports demonstrating the use of celecoxib in
analgesic-intolerant subjects. in the report of the ‘‘celecoxib in aspirin-intolerant asthma study group,’’ a well
tolerability of celecoxib was demonstrated in 27 patients
with aspirin-intolerant asthma (17) in accordance with
other trials (20, 21). in the largest study conducted among
asthma patients with ai, none of the 60 subjects experienced any adverse event following celecoxib administration (19). similarly, we did not observe any reaction
to celecoxib in 19 patients with aspirin-induced asthma.
tolerability of celecoxib in patients with pseudoallergic
reactions other than asthma to nsaids was assessed by
boehncke et al. (22). in this study, all 72 subjects tolerated
the drug well. similarly, another trial conducted by
ahlbach et al. demonstrated no reaction with celecoxib
use in patients with urticaria and/or angioedema (24).
however, other trials showed that drugs that preferentially
inhibit cox-2 ( xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx ) or selectively
inhibit cox-2 (rofecoxib and celecoxib) revealed cutaneous reactions in a significant proportion of subjects
(3–33%) (5–11, 26). in our study, none of the subjects
with a history of cutaneous reaction following administration of asa/nsaids showed reaction to the celecoxib
challenge. considering the results of these trials, celecoxib
appears to be a safe drug for patients who develop both
cutaneous or asthmatic reactions to nsaids.
in 14 postmarketing, placebo-controlled clinical trials,
0.002% of the 6376 patients taking celecoxib were reported
to manifest hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria,
angioedema, and larynx edema (27). there was no
anaphylaxis in these series. however, recently, potentially
life-threatening anaphylactic reactions after administration
of celecoxib have been reported (28–31). the majority of
these cases had no drug allergy previously and had been
demonstrated to tolerate other cox-1 inhibitors and
selective cox-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib. only one

case was reported to have an intolerance reaction to
indomethacin previously (29). common features of these
subjects were female gender, being over 50 years of age
and having a disorder such as joint pain, coxarthritis, and
tendinitis with the need of regular use of celecoxib.
although the majority of the subjects had a history of
regular use of celecoxib without previous difficulty, one
patient experienced anaphylaxis after the third intake of the
drug. it is not clear which factors predict the development
of anaphylaxis in subjects taking celecoxib. in these trials,
no evidence of an ige-mediated reaction to the drug or a
cross-reaction to other selective cox-2 inhibitors was
shown. in one study, no patients with celecoxib-induced
anaphylaxis was given because of absence of cross reactivity
between sulfo-containing drugs and celecoxib (31).
for the challenge protocols, there is no consensus for the
challenge protocol for celecoxib. in this trial, we selected
200 mg as the maximum provocation dose, which is the
recommended therapeutic dose of the drug for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and for pain palliation. higher doses of the drug could be necessary for
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in case of failure to
treatment with conventional doses. however, 200 mg of the
drug was reported to have superior effect for pain relief
compared with placebo and aspirin. in our trial, none of the
subjects had osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and the
main provocation aim was pain relief. therefore, we used
200 mg of the drug as the maximum provocation dose for
the test. on the other hand, higher doses—up to 400 mg—
of the drug, have been well tolerated in patients with ai
(17). however, because of the development of anaphylaxis
even after small doses, such as 50 mg of the drug in one
indomethasin-intolerant subject, it is safer to start with
lower doses of the drug followed by small-dose increments
in oral challenge protocols with celecoxib.
atopy has been suggested as an important risk factor for
the development of intolerance reactions against asa/
nsaids (32). in our series, atopy rate was 34.7%. although
it seems to be higher than that of general population of
turkey (25%, p < 0.01), for comorbid disorders, atopy rates
were 23.5% and 38% in patients without comorbid disorder
and with asthma, respectively (33). therefore, the presence
of higher atopy rate in patients with ai seemed to be
secondary to the higher frequency of concomitant asthma in
accordance with our previous finding (34).
one limitation of the current study is the absence of
controlled oral challenge for confirmation of asa/nsaids
intolerance. oral provocation tests with analgesics have
been accepted as gold standard for the diagnosis of ai (35).
instead, we used oral challenge to identify a safe alternative
drug for asa/nsaids-intolerant patients. this approach
has been proven to be safe, rapid and reliable, and it
meets the ethical considerations in clinical practice (7, 36).
moreover, a significant correlation between the history of
intolerance and the results of oral challenges in aspirinintolerant patients has been previously demonstrated (37).
we also selected patients with a reliable history of reaction
against analgesics on at least two separate occasions.
in conclusion, celecoxib might be an alternative drug for
asa/nsaids-intolerant patients. despite the absence of

g. çelik et al.
any adverse reaction with celecoxib in our series,
considering its serious adverse events in the literature, we
suggest the need for a standardized protocol starting with
low doses. therefore, the drug should be recommended
for patients with ai after being tested by an experienced
allergist with oral challenge in equipped settings. longitudinal studies in larger groups are required for long-term
safety of celecoxib use in patients with ai.
