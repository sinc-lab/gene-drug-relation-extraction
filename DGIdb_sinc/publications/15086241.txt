√ in this report the authors describe a woman with low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma who was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. after receiving  xxxd2557xxx  continuously for 19 years
for chronic hormone suppression, she began to experience progressive dementia. magnetic resonance imaging revealed 11
separate intracranial meningiomas of various sizes. the largest lesions were treated with staged angiographically guided
embolization and excision. despite discontinuation of  xxxd2557xxx , the remaining smaller lesions grew slightly in
size, requiring further treatment with a combination of excision and gamma knife stereotactic surgery. all of the excised
tumors showed positive staining for progesterone receptors on immunohistochemical examination. prolonged therapy with
 xxxd2557xxx  could promote the growth of benign intracranial meningiomas in some patients.

eningiomas are more than twice as common in
women as in men. these tumors may progress
rapidly during pregnancy, indicating that hormonal stimuli may be important factors in their growth. similarly, an association with other hormonally responsive tumors such as breast carcinoma has been reported, although
a direct oncological link has not been conclusively established.12 meningiomas are believed to arise from arachnoid
granulations, in which arachnoid cap cells are found to express high levels of progesterone receptors.25 the possibility of a hormonal link to meningioma growth is further suggested by the observation of receptors for sex steroids in
these tumors. the presence of progesterone receptors has
been observed more consistently in meningiomas than have
either estrogen or androgen receptors.2,9,17,23 moreover, the
presence of measurable sex steroid receptors is more common in the meningiomas of women than in those of men.3
several different methods have been used to measure estrogen and  xxxg1737xxx  status in meningiomas
and in other tumors. using both dextran-coated charcoal
and immunocytochemical methods, bozzetti, et al.,5 detected progesterone receptors in 89 and 70%, respectively, of
a large number of mengiomas. in the same study, estrogen receptors were found in only 18% of the tumors. blankenstein, et al.,4 reported similar results. although a higher histological grade and a greater extent of ki-67 labeling
are both predictive of a tendency for meningioma recur-

rence, the expression of progesterone receptors is associated with a longer disease-free interval.9 the expression of
such normal physiological markers as estrogen receptors
and progesterone receptors is consistent with a higher state
of differentiation, and the absence of progesterone receptors
may be an indicator of a tumor’s biological aggressiveness.19 meningotheliomatous meningiomas frequently express progesterone receptors, whereas transitional and fibrous subtypes are less likely to do so.17 this observation is
also consistent with the tendency toward greater recurrence
rates for transitional and fibrous meningioma subtypes.
case report
history. this 56-year-old left-handed woman experienced progressive personality changes during the 12
months preceding her hospitalization. she was initially
treated for depression, but during this period of time her
performance at work deteriorated and she had increasing
difficulty concentrating on various tasks. she eventually exhibited increasingly inappropriate social behavior and her
intellectual functioning and short-term memory declined.
she became disinterested in activities that had previously
been enjoyable to her and her judgment deteriorated. her
medical history was significant for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus, which was diagnosed 19
years previously. at that time, she had undergone total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. following surgery, she was treated with  xxxd2557xxx  acej. neurosurg. / volume 100 / february, 2004

examination. preoperative mr imaging revealed 11 separate dural-based lesions with homogeneous contrast enhancement (fig. 1). five of these, including the frontal
convexity, sphenoid wing, and falcine tumors, were substantially larger than the other lesions.
operation. several of the lesions were removed through
right frontal and left temporal craniotomies performed 2
weeks apart. before each operation, the patient had undergone angiographically guided embolization of the dominant
lesions with the aid of gelfoam particles and glue. just before the first craniotomy,  xxxd2557xxx  was discontinued. on pathological studies, all lesions exhibited the features of meningotheliomatous meningiomas (fig. 2 upper).
each tumor showed positive staining for progesterone receptors (fig. 2 lower). after the second craniotomy, the
patient attained significant improvement in cognitive function. within 6 months, however, she began to experience recurrence of her original neurological symptoms in association with a slight increase in tumor size and significantly
increased edema (fig. 3 upper). she underwent a third craniotomy for removal of the bifrontal falcine meningioma
and three other smaller subfrontal tumors. the remaining
lesions were treated with gamma knife stereotactic surgery,
and one tumor located close to the left optic nerve was treated with fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation
therapy.

postoperative course. all tumors treated with the gamma
knife shrank markedly over the next 24 months, and the lesion treated with fractionated radiation therapy remained
stable. the patient works full time and her neurological status has improved to its premorbid state, with only mild residual short-term memory dysfunction.

discussion
endometrial stromal sarcoma is a rare neoplasm representing less than 0.2% of all gynecological cancers, with
both low- and high-grade forms described in the literature.14
the malignant potential of high-grade tumors is demonstrated by aggressive, invasive, and metastatic behavior, despite resection. low-grade tumors have a relatively indolent course with slow growth, although recurrences up to 20
years after the initial diagnosis and treatment have been
reported.14 both low- and high-grade endometrial stromal
sarcomas are managed similarly with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and irradia329

tion. a number of reports have addressed the possibility of
long-term suppression with hormone therapy.1,13,14,21
the rationale for using hormone manipulation to control endometrial stromal sarcoma stems from evidence that
such agents suppress the endometrial epithelium.21 a strong
embryological relationship exists between the endometrial epithelium and endometrial stroma, with both being of
müllerian ductal origin and hence influenced by menstruation and pregnancy.1 atrophy and reversal of proliferation
of the endometrial epithelium have been demonstrated after administration of progesterone agonists.14,21 katz, et al.,14
controlled recurrences of endometrial stromal sarcoma with
hormone therapy ( xxxd2557xxx , 160 mg/day). in addition, they identified the presence of progesterone receptors
in surgical specimens of endometrial stroma sarcoma. in the
presence of progesterone receptors, progesterone agonists
have been shown to be a useful adjunct to resection for prolonged suppression of tumor recurrence. a similar relationship between tumor growth and sex steroid receptor status
has been established for recurrent endometrial carcinomas
in experiments with progesterone agonists, producing a
92% response rate in such tumors.6
an association between meningioma growth and various
hormonal factors has been reported previously, and a number of studies have documented the presence of either progesterone or estrogen receptors in benign meningiomas.
330

these observations have led to attempts to control meningioma growth or recurrence by using various hormonal treatment strategies. in one such study, medroxyprogesterone
acetate failed to reduce tumor size or prevent progression of
either benign or malignant meningiomas.11 another study in
which  xxxd2557xxx  was used for treatment of unresectable meningiomas produced no responses in nine patients
and deteriorating vision in two.7 moreover, at least one example of meningioma progression has been reported in a
patient receiving levonorgestrel (norplant), another progesterone agonist.22 similarly, cases of meningioma progression during pregnancy have been reported.10,24
the antiprogestational agent mifepristone was used in
one study8 to treat 14 patients with meningioma, resulting
in objective tumor volume reduction in five patients and
symptomatic relief in three others. in another study,15 25%
of patients with meningiomas responded to mifepristone.
similarly, lamberts, et al.,16 reported tumor control in six
of 10 patients treated with mifepristone. hence, antiprogestational hormone therapy may provide effective treatment
for some patients with meningiomas. it remains to be determined, however, whether the  xxxg1737xxx  status
of these tumors is predictive of responsiveness.
laboratory investigations have shown mifepristone to be
capable of inhibiting the growth of human meningiomas
implanted in nude mice.20 nevertheless, the relationship
between tumor receptor status and response to hormone
manipulation is more complex than can be accounted for
simply by the presence or absence of specific hormone
receptor types. for example, antiprogestational agents such
as mifepristone and onapristone have been shown to have a
cytostatic or cytocidal effect on cultured meningioma cells,
even when progesterone receptors cannot be detected.18
therefore, some antitumor effects of the antiprogestational
agents might not be mediated directly by progesterone receptors. thus, the relationship of  xxxg1603xxx  status to
tumor growth and the role of receptor agonists and antagonists in the treatment of these tumors have yet to be defined.
conclusions
in our patient, multiple meningiomas developed concurrently with longstanding use of the progesterone agonist
 xxxd2557xxx  and a history of an endometrial stromal
tumor. one possibility is that this patient had an increased
susceptibility to tumor formation in tissues with high  xxxg1737xxx  expression, including the uterus and
arachnoidal cap cells of the meninges. alternatively, it
might be that chronic administration of  xxxd2557xxx 
stimulated the development of multiple meningiomas in
association with strong  xxxg1737xxx  expression in
already genetically susceptible tissues. currently, the postoperative management of low-grade endometrial sarcoma
includes the use of low-dose progesterone agonists. the occurrence of a single case of multiple meningiomas in this
clinical setting does not warrant abandonment of what has
proven to be an effective treatment modality for this condition. in our patient, discontinuation of  xxxd2557xxx  was followed by a slight increase in the size of several
of the remaining tumors and a significant increase in edema
throughout the frontal white matter 6 months after the initial surgeries. as with other reports in the literature, this
case highlights the possible relationship between meningioj. neurosurg. / volume 100 / february, 2004

meningiomas and  xxxd2557xxx 
ma formation and hormones, and it indicates a potential role
for biological strategies to control such tumors.
