abstract
in the present study, we investigated the effect of  xxxd2098xxx -induced constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity on muscarinic receptor
agonist- and histamine-induced bovine tracheal smooth muscle contractions. bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were incubated with 10
mm  xxxd2098xxx  or vehicle for various periods of time ž5, 30 min, 18 h. at 37 8c. after extensive washout ž3 h, 37 8c., isometric
contractions were measured to the full muscarinic receptor agonist  xxxd2586xxx , the partial muscarinic receptor agonist 4-ž m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy.-2-butynyltrimethylammonium žmcn-a-343. and histamine.  xxxd2098xxx  treatment significantly reduced the sensitivity žpec 50 . to  xxxd2586xxx  in a time-dependent manner, without affecting maximal contraction ž emax ..  xxxd2098xxx  treatment similarly
reduced the pec 50 of mcn-a-343 and histamine; however, emax values were also reduced, to approximately 70% of control after 18-h
treatment. the  xxxd1422xxx   xxxd3377xxx , having no effect on control preparations, consistently restored the reduced pec 50 and emax values
of the contractile agonists. remarkably, in the presence of  xxxd3377xxx  the pec 50 values of mcn-a-343 and histamine in  xxxd2098xxx -treated
airways were significantly enhanced compared to controls. in conclusion,  xxxd2098xxx -induced constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity reduces
muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be reversed by the inverse
agonist  xxxd3377xxx . moreover, after b 2-adrenoceptor agonist treatment, inverse agonism by b-adrenoceptor antagonists may cause enhanced
airway reactivity to contractile mediators. q 2001 published by elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
recently, it has become clear that g-protein-coupled
receptors, including the b 2-adrenoceptor, not only transmit
signals after stimulation by agonists but can also spontaneously couple to signaling pathways žsamama et al.,
1993; chidiac et al., 1994; lefkowitz et al., 1993; scheer
and cotecchia, 1997; leurs et al., 1998.. experimental
evidence obtained with a constitutively active mutant of
the b 2-adrenoceptor, with mutations in the c-terminal
portion of the third intracellular loop of the receptor, have
indicated that the b 2-adrenoceptor isomerizes between an
inactive conformation žr. and a constitutively active conformation žr) ., which can couple to the gs-protein in the
absence of an agonist žsamama et al., 1993.. under basal
conditions, constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity is low

because of structural constraints that keep the b 2-adrenoceptor in the inactive r state by preventing an effective
interaction between peptide sequences in the intracellular
loops of the receptor and the g-protein. agonist binding or
mutations in the b 2-adrenoceptor are believed to shift the
equilibrium towards r) by relieving this constraint. the
activity of constitutively active b 2-adrenoceptor can be
inhibited by antagonists with negative intrinsic efficacy
ž‘inverse agonists’. such as  xxxd3377xxx  and propranolol, which
shift the receptor from the active to the inactive conformation žchidiac et al., 1994; samama et al., 1994..
until recently, basal constitutive activity of the wild
type b 2-adrenoceptor has only been visualized by overexpression of the receptor, which increases the absolute
amount of r) žchidiac et al., 1994.. however, using
bovine tracheal smooth muscle, we have recently shown
that agonist-independent constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity may also be induced by b-adrenoceptor agonist
treatment žde vries et al., 2000.. thus, incubation of
bovine tracheal smooth muscle with  xxxd2098xxx  caused a
time- and concentration-dependent decrease of kcl-in-

duced contraction after extensive washout of the b-adrenoceptor agonist. this effect could be acutely reversed by
 xxxd3377xxx , with even an increased kcl-induced contraction in
the presence of this  xxxd1422xxx  žde vries et al., 2000..
since b 2-adrenoceptor agonists are the most frequently
used bronchodilators in the treatment of asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease žcopd. and b-adrenoceptor agonist-induced constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity
could diminish bronchoconstriction in response to endogenous neurotransmitters or mediators even after washout of
the agonist, we investigated the effect of  xxxd2098xxx -induced
constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity on bovine tracheal
smooth muscle contractions to muscarinic receptor agonists and histamine. in addition, since it has been demonstrated previously that b 2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy
may cause enhanced airway reactivity to propranolol in
patients with asthma after washout of the b-adrenoceptor
agonist žkraan et al., 1985; koeter
¨ et al., 1983., we also
sought evidence whether this hyperresponsiveness to badrenoceptor antagonists is related to inverse agonism of
constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity induced by b 2-adrenoceptor agonist treatment.

tion period, with washings every 30 min, the resting
tension was gradually adjusted to 3 g. subsequently, the
strips were precontracted with 20 and 40 mm isotonic kcl
and, after two changes to fresh kh-buffer, precontracted
by cumulative administration of  xxxd2586xxx  ž0.1, 1, 10
mm., followed by washout žthree changes of bath volume..
under  xxxd2398xxx  ž0.1 mm.-induced basal tone the strips
were readjusted to 3-g resting tension, immediately followed by two changes of bath volume. the entire procedure resulted in a thorough washout of  xxxd2098xxx  ž3 h, 37

after washout for 45 min with three changes of bath
volume, a second crc to  xxxd2586xxx  or histamine was
recorded, following 30-min preincubation of 1 mm  xxxd3377xxx . because of incomplete washout of the agonist, concentration response curves to 4-ž m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy.-2-butynyltrimethylammonium žmcn-a-343; 10

on pec 50 and emax values of  xxxd2586xxx  in the vehicletreated control preparations žtable 1..
with the partial muscarinic receptor agonist mcn-a343, a significant shift in pec 50 was already present after
5 min of  xxxd2098xxx  incubation, which was slightly increased
after 30 min and 18 h of incubation with the b-adrenoceptor agonist to approximately 0.4 log units ž p - 0.001.

pec 50 values of mcn-a-343 of the strips treated with
 xxxd2098xxx  for 5 and 30 min, respectively, were restored to

presence of the  xxxd1422xxx  the pec 50 of mcn-a-343
in the 18-h  xxxd2098xxx -treated strips was significantly enhanced compared to vehicle-treated controls žfig. 2b, table

recently, we have shown that constitutive activity of
the wild type b 2-adrenoceptor in bovine tracheal smooth
muscle may be induced by incubation of this tissue with
the b 2-adrenergic agonist  xxxd2098xxx . the agonist-independent b 2-adrenoceptor activity caused a decrease of kcl-induced contraction, which was acutely reversed by various
inverse agonists, including  xxxd3377xxx  žde vries et al., 2000..

b. de vries et al.r european journal of pharmacology 431 (2001) 353–359

in the present study, we demonstrated that  xxxd2098xxx -induced constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity in bovine tracheal smooth muscle also reduces the contraction in response to muscarinic receptor agonists and histamine.
completely in line with theoretical models and previous
experiments describing the pharmacology of functional
antagonism between contractile and relaxing agonists in
bovine tracheal smooth muscle žvan den brink, 1973a,b.,
the reduced contractile response to the full muscarinic
receptor agonist  xxxd2586xxx —displaying a considerable
receptor and transduction reserve with respect to bovine
tracheal smooth muscle contraction žvan den brink, 1973a;
meurs et al., 1988. —was characterized by only a shift of
the concentration response curve to the right, whereas the
reduced response to the partial muscarinic receptor agonist
mcn-a-343—having no reserve žmeurs et al., 1988. —was
additionally characterized by a reduced emax . the reduced
response to histamine, which has a smaller receptor and
transduction reserve than  xxxd2586xxx  žvan den brink,
1973b; van amsterdan et al., 1989., similarly displayed
both a reduced pec 50 and emax .
several observations from the present and a previous
study žde vries et al., 2000. strongly argue against the
possibility that some residual  xxxd2098xxx  would have caused
the reduced contractile responses. first, after incubation
with this short-acting b-adrenoceptor agonist, the tissue
was thoroughly washed, a procedure lasting 3 h and including at least 12 changes of bath volume, making the
presence of residual b-adrenoceptor agonist in the tissue
highly unlikely. secondly, in the presence of  xxxd3377xxx , 18-h
 xxxd2098xxx -treated tissue showed a significantly enhanced
sensitivity to mcn-a-343 and histamine as compared to
control žfigs. 2b and 3b, table 1.. in a previous study,
similarly enhanced contractions of  xxxd2098xxx -treated bovine
tracheal smooth muscle were observed in response to kcl
in the presence of  xxxd3377xxx  žde vries et al., 2000.. obviously, the enhanced sensitivity of  xxxd2098xxx -treated bovine
tracheal smooth muscle to the contractile agonists and kcl
in the presence of  xxxd3377xxx  cannot be explained by displacement of residual b-adrenoceptor agonist. in addition, the
inverse agonism of  xxxd3377xxx  in our previous study was
competitively inhibited by the less efficacious  xxxd1422xxx   xxxd2435xxx  žde vries et al., 2000.. this competition
would not be expected if the response to  xxxd3377xxx  was
brought about by displacement of residual b-adrenoceptor
agonist from the receptor. finally, the rank order of the
inverse efficacies of six b-adrenoceptor antagonists on the
constitutively active receptor did not correspond with the
receptor occupancies on the inactive receptor žde vries et
al., 2000.; in case of displacement of residual b-adrenoceptor agonist from the receptor, the effect of b-adrenoceptor antagonists would be related to their receptor occupancies.
reduced contractile responses to muscarinic receptor
agonists and histamine after b-adrenoceptor agonist treatment have been observed before, in vivo as well as in

357

vitro. thus, in a dog model, repeated administration of
 xxxd2398xxx  aerosol for 60 min resulted in reduced  xxxd2586xxx -induced bronchoconstriction after washout of the
b-adrenoceptor agonist žstephan et al., 1980.. a similar
effect was observed for inhaled histamine after 7 days of
subcutaneous administration of  xxxd2398xxx  to guinea pigs
ždouglas et al., 1977. and for the carbachol-induced contractility of isolated guinea pig trachea after 3-h incubation
with  xxxd2398xxx  žfernandes et al., 1988.. interestingly, in
all cases, the reduced airway reactivity to muscarinic receptor agonists and histamine after b-agonist treatment
was accompanied by desensitization of the b-agonist-induced response žstephan et al., 1980; douglas et al., 1977;
fernandes et al., 1988.. a possible association between
constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity and b 2-adrenoceptor
desensitization has also been indicated at the molecular
level. thus, a constitutively active mutant of the b 2-adrenoceptor expressed in chinese hamster ovary žcho. cells
showed agonist-independent activity but was also tonically
down-regulated and partly uncoupled from the g-protein
žpei et al., 1994.. this mutant receptor, reconstituted in
phospholipid vesicles, was phosphorylated by b-adrenergic
receptor kinase žbark. to a similar extent as the agoniststimulated wild type receptor žpei et al., 1994.. moreover,
inverse agonists were found to decrease the basal phosphorylation of the mutant receptor žsamama et al., 1994..
hence, an active form of the desensitized receptor was
proposed.
the mechanism of the induction of constitutive b 2adrenoceptor activity by  xxxd2098xxx  is presently unknown.
just like desensitization, it is a rapid process taking only
5–30 min to significantly depress contractile agonist- and
kcl-induced contractions. receptor phosphorylation, being a rapid regulatory mechanism, might be responsible for
the induction of constitutive receptor activity. receptor
phosphorylation has recently been shown to play a role in
morphine-induced constitutive m-opioid receptor activation. in sh-sy neuroblastoma cells and in the guinea pig
ileum, chronic activation of the m-opioid receptor by morphine resulted in constitutive activation of the receptor and
inverse agonistic behaviour of naloxone, as shown by a
camp overshoot in the sh-sy cells and the ‘abstinance
response’ of the ileum, respectively. in both cases, the
protein kinase inhibitor 1-ž5-isoquinolinesulfonyl.-2-methylpiperazine žh7. prevented the inverse agonism of naloxone žwang et al., 194a,b; cruz et al., 1996.. in human
embryonic kidney žhek. 293 cells expressing the m-opioid
receptor, h7 was also shown to prevent both basal and
morphine-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor
žwang et al., 1996.. moreover, in acutely morphine-dependent mice naloxone induced withdrawal jumping, which
again was inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor h7
žwang et al., 1994a,b; bilsky et al., 1996..
agonist-induced constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity
could be a protective mechanism against desensitization in
reaction to short-term agonist treatment. however, it has

358

b. de vries et al.r european journal of pharmacology 431 (2001) 353–359

been demonstrated that long-term ž2–6 weeks. treatment
with regular b-adrenoceptor agonists may lead to enhanced
bronchial reactivity after washout of the agonist, both in
vivo and ex vivo, and may thus worsen asthma symptoms
žkoeter
¨ et al., 1983; kraan et al., 1985; vathenen et al.,
1988; sears et al., 1990; witt enderby et al., 1993; wang
et al., 1994a,b..
remarkably, mcn-a-343- and histamine-induced contractions of 18-h  xxxd2098xxx -treated tissue were significantly
potentiated by  xxxd3377xxx . in a previous study on constitutive
b 2-adrenoceptor activity in bovine tracheal smooth muscle,
kcl-induced contractions were similarly potentiated by
 xxxd3377xxx  after 5-, 30-min and 18-h incubation of the tissue
with  xxxd2098xxx  žde vries et al., 2000.. moreover, in sf9
cells overexpressing the human b 2-adrenoceptor, chidiac
et al. ž1996. have shown that b-adrenoceptor agonist-induced desensitization of the cells is associated with increased inverse agonism of various antagonists with žpartial. inverse efficacies. collectively, these results indicate
that enhanced inverse agonism by b-adrenoceptor antagonists after b-adrenoceptor agonist treatment may cause
airway hyperreactivity to bronchoconstrictive stimuli. this
mechanism could be of clinical relevance with regard to
the observation that asthmatic patients showed enhanced
airway hyperreactivity to propranolol—an antagonist with
similar inverse efficacy compared to  xxxd3377xxx  žde vries et
al., 2000; chidiac et al., 1996. —after 2–4 weeks of
terbutaline treatment žkoeter
¨ et al., 1983; kraan et al.,
1985.. in how far airway reactivity to propranolol in
non-b-adrenoceptor agonist-treated patients is due to inverse agonism remains to be established.
in conclusion, the present study indicates that fenoterolinduced constitutive b 2-adrenoceptor activity reduces muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be
reversed by the  xxxd1422xxx   xxxd3377xxx . b-adrenoceptor
agonist-induced constitutive activity could contribute to
the beneficial bronchodilating effect of these drugs. conversely, inverse agonism by  xxxd3377xxx  after b-adrenoceptoragonist treatment may cause enhanced airway reactivity to
contractile mediators.
