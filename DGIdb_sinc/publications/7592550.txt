 xxxg102xxx  (agt) 2 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent,
mitochondrial enzyme which, in the rat, is expressed at a high level in the kidney. the
amino acid sequences of nine tryptic and seven cnbr peptides of the rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  were
determined. three overlapping cdnas encoding the  xxxg103xxx  were cloned on the basis of its
partial amino acid sequences by means of a polymerase chain reaction-based approach
involving rat kidney poly(a)+ rna. the complete cdna sequence comprised 1,919 bases,
and contained a 1,536-base open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 512 amino
acid residues with a putative presequence consisting of 39 amino acid residues at the amino
terminus, giving a precursor protein with a molecular mass of 57,150 da. the sequence of
 xxxg103xxx  exhibits significant homology with neither peroxisomal  xxxg102xxx  from human liver nor
mitochondrial  xxxg102xxx  from rat liver. however, the sequence of  xxxg103xxx  exhibited 30.8, 29.2,
and 27.1% identity with those of escherichia coli  xxxg8xxx , rat
 xxxg1621xxx , and pseudomonas cepacia 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase,
respectively. the active site sequences were also well conserved among these aminotransferases.  xxxg103xxx , thus, is more similar to the other aminotransferases than to  xxxg102xxx . the
results suggest that the rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  may play a biological role in amino acid
metabolism distinct from that of  xxxg102xxx .

 xxxg102xxx  (agt) [ec 2.6.1.44]
is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of glyoxylate to glycine
with l-alanine as an amino donor (1-3). the enzyme is
present in many mammalian organs, including liver (2, 4,
5) and kidney (6, 7). in rat liver (2), two forms of the
enzyme, designated as isozyme 1 ( xxxg102xxx ) and isozyme 2
( xxxg103xxx ), are found (2, 6).  xxxg102xxx  is located in both peroxisomes and mitochondria in rat liver, and has two major
enzyme activities, those of  xxxg102xxx  and serine-pyruvate aminotransferase (2). in liver,
the total content of the  xxxg102xxx  and  xxxg103xxx  enzymes is in the
order, dog > cat > mouse > rat, and the  xxxg103xxx / xxxg102xxx  ratio
varies (2). in rat kidney (6), agt is only present in
mitochondria and does not show serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity (2, 6), suggesting that only  xxxg103xxx  is
present in this organ.
in mammalia,  xxxg102xxx  is believed to play an important role
in the metabolic pathway of glyoxylate detoxification (8),
such as in  xxxg102xxx  (phi). the
enzyme have been purified from human liver (9, 10), and

rat liver (11, 12) and kidney (7), and characterized
biochemically. the amino acid sequences of the enzymes
from human liver (10, 13) and rat liver (21) were deduced
from their cdnas, except that the partial amino acid
sequences of the enzymes (9, 12, 13) were determined
chemically. no structural information on the  xxxg103xxx  from
any animal organs has yet been reported. okuno et al. (7)
reported that rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  was identical with rat liver
 xxxg103xxx  but not with rat liver  xxxg102xxx , based on the results of
immunological analysis. rat liver mitochondrial  xxxg102xxx  was
induced by glucagon (2, 14, 15), but  xxxg103xxx  was not in either
liver (2) or kidney (26). therefore, the organ distribution
and behavior as to hormonal induction are significantly
different between  xxxg102xxx  and  xxxg103xxx . recently, it was
reported that  xxxg103xxx  is a molecular species identical with
alanine-y,tf-dioxovalerate aminotransferase in bovine
liver (17), dimethylarginine-pyruvate aminotransferase in
rat kidney (16), and d-3-aminobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase in rat liver (18). our main aim is to determine
whether or not  xxxg102xxx  and  xxxg103xxx  have different functions in
amino acid metabolism.
for understanding of the molecular structures and
enzymatic properties of agt isozymes, we report here the
molecular cloning and sequencing of rat kidney  xxxg103xxx 
cdna to establish how this enzyme is related structurally
and functionally to  xxxg102xxx  and to several other aminotransferases. this report deals with determination of the amino

cloning and sequencing of rat  xxxg103xxx  cdna
acid sequences of tryptic and cnbr peptides, the sequences
of three cloned cdna (372, 896, and 1,057 bp) fragments
of  xxxg103xxx , and alignment of the amino acid sequence
deduced from the nucleotide sequence of this enzyme with
those of various aminotransferases, especially isozymes of
 xxxg102xxx .
materials and methods
enzyme purification and amino acid sequencing—
 xxxg103xxx  was purified from the kidneys of wister strain rats
as described previously (7). the purified rat  xxxg103xxx  was
further subjected to reversed-phase hplc on a biofine
rpc-sc18 column (4.6x250 mm, japan spectroscopic,
tokyo) with a linear gradient, from zero to 70%, of
acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at the flow
rate of 1.0 ml/min, and detected as to the absorbance at
230 nm. the purified enzyme was subjected to enzymatic
and chemical fragmentation. digestion with trypsin was
carried out in 0.1 m nrl,hco3, ph 8.0, at 3tc. cleavage
with cnbr was carried out in 70%  xxxd2154xxx  at room
temperature for 20 h (19). peptides were separated by
reversed-phase hplc as described above and then rechromatographed in the same way for mixed peptides. the
intact enzyme, and ten tryptic and seven cnbr peptides
were sequenced using an applied biosystems 477a gas/
liquid-phase protein sequencer equipped with an on-line
120a pth analyzer (20).
pcr cloning with synthesized oligonucleotides—based
on the amino acid sequence of the  xxxg103xxx  protein, three
oligonucleotides were synthesized. the sequences of pi,
p2, andp3 were 5'ctgcacaccaagcacaatagt3' (pi,
positions; 170-190), deduced from the amino (n)-terminus
of the mature protein, 5'ctctacgtggtctgggaccg3'
(p2, positions; 1576-1557), derived from the carboxyl
(c)-terminal amino acid sequence of a cnbr peptide, and
5'tgagt(ct)tg(ga)aatcc(ga)ta(ga)aa(ga)tg3'
(p3, positions; 1063-1040), derived from the internal
amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides, respectively.
complementary dnas were synthesized from rat kidney
poly(a)+ rna with a first strand cdna synthesis kit
(pharmacia) using oligonucleotides pi and p2 as primers.
the pcr products amplified with the pi and p2 primers
were used as the templates for the second cycle pcr with
the pi and p3 primers. thirty cycles (95"c for 0.5 min,
54'c for 1 min, and 72"c for 2 min) were performed using
taq dna polymerase (takara shuzo). agarose gel electrophoresis was performed, and the region of the gel containing 900-bp dna (900-bp  xxxg103xxx  cdna) was excised,
followed by purification with geneclean™ (bi0 101).
the 900-bp fragment was directly subcloned into the ecobi
site of pcr™n using a ta cloning kit (invitrogen), and
sequenced partially using the m13 forward and m13
reverse primers. to determine the sequence of the full
length cdna, the two cdna fragments corresponding to
the 3'- and 5'-regions were cloned. a 3'-extended cdna
( xxxg103xxx -3' cdna) of 1,057 bp was obtained by the "race"
method (21) with an oligo(dt)18-£cori/-nort adaptor
primer (pharmacia lkb biotechnology) and a synthetic
primer 5'ctgaacacttctgtggccacgtc3' (p4, positions; 865-885), and directly inserted into the ecorl site of
pcr™n. a 5'-extended cdna ( xxxg103xxx -5' cdna) of 372-bp
was isolated by the primer extension cloning method of

frohman et al. (22) using a timesaver cdna synthesis kit
(pharmacia biotech) with a synthetic primer, 5'ctgcacaccaagcacaatagt3' (pi, positions; 170-190), and
purified poly(a)+ rna, and was subcloned into the ecobi
site of pbluescript ks+ as described previously (23).
dna sequencing—dna sequencing was carried out by
the combination of the dideoxy-chain termination method
(24), using t7 dna polymerase (sequenase), and the
automated fluorescent dna sequencing method (25, 26),
using the taq dye deoxy terminator and dye primer, with
an applied biosystems 373a dna sequencer (institute for
protein research, osaka university). for the former
method, plasmids as well as m13mp phages were used for
sequencing as vectors. for the latter method, pcr™ii and
bluescript ks+ plasmids, bomhi cut linear dsdna, or
m13mpl8 vectors were sequenced using the taq dye
primer, bcabest dye primer or taq dye terminator. the
cdna clones were sequenced from both ends using standard primers and specific primers, as described in table i,
which were used to complete the full-length sequence.
preparation of rna and northern blot analysis—total
rnas from rat kidney were extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (27).
poly(a)+ rna was purified by oligo(dt)-cellulose chromatography (pharmacia lkb biotechnology). twenty
microgram aliquots of total rna were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and transferred to nylon
filter membranes. the filters were hybridized with
32
p-labeled cdnas synthesized with a random labeling kit
(boebringer mannheim) at 65'c overnight in 0.5 m sodium
phosphate, ph 7.5, 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 7% sds, 2
mm edta, and 100 //g/ml salmon sperm dna. the filters
were washed three times at 65'c with 0.2 x ssc, 1% sds.
homology search—a computer search for sequence
homology was carried out using the fast homology search
program from genetyx software development.
results
amino acid sequencing—the amino terminal sequence
of the  xxxg103xxx  protein was determined to 27 cycles, as shown
in fig. 1. tryptic digestion and cnbr cleavage of the  xxxg103xxx 
protein were performed as described under 'materials
and methods," and the tryptic peptides and cnbr peptides were purified by hplc as shown in fig. 2, a and b.

fig. 3. sequencing strategy for  xxxg103xxx  cdna. the complete
cdna sequence was constructed by overlapping the three cloned
cdna sequences. the three primers (p1-p3) used in pcrs and the
dideoxy sequencing reactions involving standard primers are indicated by arrows. further sequencing reactions were performed using
specific primers pi, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, and p l l primers,
that were deduced from previously sequenced regions. the coding and
noncoding regions are presented as a box and solid lines, respectively.
the open box denotes the coding sequence containing the presequence
of cdna.

the amino acid sequences of ten tryptic and seven cnbr
peptides were analyzed. the sequence of a total 178 amino
acid residues including the amino terminal sequence of the
original protein was determined, as shown in fig. 1.
pcr cloning and sequence analysis of rat  xxxg103xxx 
cdna—total rnas were isolated from rat kidney and
poly(a)+ rna was obtained by oligo(dt)-cellulose chromatography. based on the amino acid sequences of the
amino terminal region of this protein, and tryptic and cnbr
peptides, synthetic primers (pi and p2) were prepared for
pcr amplification of  xxxg103xxx  cdna. in designing the undegenerated pcr primers, the codon usages in mammalian
vol. 117, no. 4, 1995

genes have been taken into consideration to achieve the
high specificity. the following pcr with the pi and p3
primers resulted in the amplification of a 900-bp band, as
shown in fig. 3. after subcloning of the pcr products and
sequencing of individual clones, we found a reading frame
containing the amino acid sequence of the  xxxg103xxx  protein.
the 900-bp  xxxg103xxx  cdna starting with the n-terminus of
the mature protein was considered to lack the 3'-end and
5'-end regions of the cdna for this enzyme. based on the
nucleotide sequence of 900-bp  xxxg103xxx  cdna, a 3'-extended
cdna ( xxxg103xxx -3'cdna) of 1,100 bp and a 5'-extended
cdna ( xxxg103xxx -5'cdna) of 400 bp were isolated by 3'race and 5' primer extension cloning, respectively, as
shown in fig. 3. the  xxxg103xxx -3' and  xxxg103xxx -5' cdnas encoded
the c-terminal 242 amino acid residues including the
3'-noncoding 331-bp, and the n-terminal 106 amino acid
residues containing the 5'-noncoding 52-bp nucleotides of
the enzyme, respectively. thus, the three overlapping
cdnas gave the full-length cdna for  xxxg103xxx .
northern blot analysis—total rnas extracted from rat
kidney were blotted onto nylon membranes and then
hybridized with the 900-bp  xxxg103xxx  cdna. the approximate
size of the  xxxg103xxx  mrna was found to be 2.1 kb, as shown
in fig. 4. our  xxxg103xxx  cdna with a length of 1,919 bp was
confirmed to be very close to a full-length copy of the
mrna.
sequence homology—the deduced amino acid sequence
of the rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  was compared with an nbrf
protein database and with a swiss-plot database using
the fast homology search program from genetyx software development. sequence comparison among rat kidney  xxxg103xxx , rat liver  xxxg102xxx , and pseudomonas cepacia
2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase is presented in fig. 5. the
sequence of  xxxg103xxx  is more homologous to that of p. cepacia
dialkylglycine decarboxylase (27.1%) (28) than that of the
 xxxg102xxx  isozyme from liver {9-11, 13), and shows high
homology in the region of plp-binding pockets. the lysine309 of  xxxg103xxx  seems to be a cofactor-binding residue. the
amino acid sequences around this lysine residue are conserved in several other aminotransferases, as shown in fig.

cloning and sequencing of rat  xxxg103xxx  cdna
 xxxg103xxx  cdna by the pcr cloning method. we isolated three
overlapping cdnas of  xxxg103xxx , as summarized in fig. 3. the
amino acid sequences deduced from the cdnas agree with
all of the partial sequences determined for the  xxxg103xxx 
protein. the size of  xxxg103xxx  mrna indicated that our cdna
for  xxxg103xxx  is very close to a full-length copy of the mrna,
although some of the 5'-noncoding region of the  xxxg103xxx 
mrna may be missing. thus, the three overlapping cdnas
enabled us to determine the putative complete amino acid
sequence of the  xxxg103xxx  precursor protein. the methionine
codon at position 53 is tentatively considered to be the
initiation codon, because relatively typical consensus sequences for the translation initiation codon and a ribosome
binding site-like sequence (cttccactgg) are present
around the methionine codon at position 53 (29). the open
reading frame sequence of 1,536 nucleotides starting with
the methionine codon at position 53 encodes the precursor
 xxxg103xxx  protein with a molecular mass of 57,150 da. in the
3'-end region, the cdna contains a polyadenylation signal,
aataaa (30), as shown in fig. 1.
many nuclear-encoded proteins that are imported into
the mitochondrial matrix are synthesized as precursors
with a leader peptide or presequence that includes the
signals for targeting to mitochondria (31), and are matured
by mitochondrial processing peptidases (32). the leader
sequences of the precursor protein show several common
features serving as mitochondrial targeting signals (33, 34)
(fig. 1), such as an abundance of basic and hydroxylic
residues, a nearly total absence of acidic residues, and the
formation of an amphiphilic helix. all these characteristics
are found in the n-terminal leader sequence of 39 amino
acid residues of the  xxxg103xxx  precursor. the first 17 residues
comprise a typical amphiphilic helix wheel (data not
shown).
the three amino acid sequences of rat kidney  xxxg103xxx , rat
liver  xxxg102xxx , and p. cepacia 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase are compared in fig. 5, and comparison around the
plp-binding sites of a set of plp-enzymes is shown in fig.
6. rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  and p. cepacia 2,2-dialkylglycine
decarboxylase are significantly homologous in the n- and
c-terminal regions as well as in the plp-binding region.
 xxxg103xxx  was also found to show 29.2 and 30.8% identities
with rat  xxxg1621xxx  (32) and escherichia
coli  xxxg8xxx  (35), respectively
(data not shown).
although the  xxxg103xxx  from rat kidney and the  xxxg102xxx  from
rat liver were believed to be functionally similar to isozymes, we previously found that rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  differed
from rat liver  xxxg102xxx  immunologically and kinetically.
antibodies against rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  hardly recognized rat
liver  xxxg102xxx , and the id, values of  xxxg103xxx  from rat kidney
and liver, and  xxxg102xxx  from rat liver for l-alanine are 12.5,
30, and 2.1 mm (2), respectively, when assayed using
glyoxylate (2 mm) as an amino acceptor, showing the two
isozymes are kinetically distinct. from the present study, it
can be clearly concluded that the two isozymes do not
exhibit significant structural homology, and that the plpbinding site also shows little similarity except for the
conservation of the cofactor binding lysine residue. thus,
we propose that the sequence of  xxxg103xxx  is similar to those of
aminotransferases belonging to subgroup ii (36).  xxxg102xxx  is
a member of subgroup iv. the structural relationship
between rat kidney  xxxg103xxx  and other aminotransferases can

be developed for further understanding of aminotransferase families. we are now investigating the biological
importance of  xxxg103xxx  by considering the potential activities
of transamination and decarboxylation.
we wish to thank dr. y. fujita (institute for protein research, osaka
university) for the helpful discussion in the preparation of the
manuscript.
