introduction
gemcitabine, 2’,2’-difluoro-2’- xxxd1836xxx ,  xxxd2188xxx , is a  xxxd1836xxx  analogue that is currently showing promising results as an antiviral agent and as an anticancer drug.[1, 2] it is
presently employed in multiple clinical assays, alone or in
combination with other drugs. the positive and encouraging
results obtained in the treatment of patients with non-smallcell lung cancer[3, 4] and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas,
non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian
cancer[5, 6] have already promoted its approval by the food
and drug administration (fda) and the european agency
for the evaluation of medicinal products (emea). in
europe it has been approved additionally for the treatment
of patients with bladder cancer.[7, 8]
this subject is currently under intense research and over
4500 articles with gemcitabine as a keyword have already
been published since it was first synthesized and evaluated
in experimental tumor models by hertel et al in 1990[9]
(figure 1). over this time, the corresponding number of articles in the literature has displayed exponential growth.
almost 80 % of these papers have cancer also as a keyword,

are available, it is likely that r1 inactivation is the most favorable mechanism
responsible for drug cytotoxicity. this
inhibition pathway has been unknown
to date, but we have conducted a theoretical study that has led us to the first
proposal of a mechanism for rnr inhibition by  xxxd2188xxx  in the presence of reductants.

which demonstrates the importance of this pyrimidine antimetabolite in relation to this disease.[10]
previous studies on the metabolism of gemcitabine have
demonstrated that this compound is a prodrug that is converted, by  xxxg611xxx , to the corresponding 5’-diphosphate (dfdcdp) and triphosphate (dfdctp).[11, 12] it
has been shown that these metabolites are therapeutically
active agents, capable of inhibiting cellular processes and inducing cell apoptosis.[13] the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine
is attributed to a combination of two actions performed by
these two metabolites.[11, 14] first, dfdcdp inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (rnr), which is responsible for catalyzing
the reaction that generates the deoxyribonucleotides required for dna synthesis and repair. therefore, inhibition
of this enzyme reduces the concentration of the four dna

monomers in the cell moiety. second, dfdctp competes
with the natural  xxxd1836xxx  5-triphosphate (dctp) for incorporation into the replicating dna. huang et al. showed
that once one molecule of dfdctp is incorporated, an additional deoxyribonucleotide is added to the growing dna
strands, and subsequently dna synthesis is precluded.[15]
the decreased intracellular concentration of dctp,
caused by the inhibition of rnr, has important consequences in the cell:[16–18] 1) faster phosphorylation of  xxxd2188xxx  to the
two active forms, 2) decreased metabolic clearance of the
gemcitabine nucleotides by  xxxd1836xxx  monophosphate
deaminase, and 3) enhanced incorporation of dfdctp into
dna. this self-potentiation mechanism should account for
the high anticancer efficacy of  xxxd2188xxx  relative to other nucleoside antimetabolites.
this paper focuses on the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase promoted by gemcitabine. this enzyme has been intensively studied during the last 20 years and is currently a
drug target for cancer, aids, and bacterial treatments,
which makes this subject timely and of broad interest to
many research groups.
the inhibitory mechanism of  xxxd2188xxx  is unique in rnr,[12, 19]
and has several discrepancies from the other already established inhibitory mechanisms.[20, 21] for example, and contrary
to what happens with 2’-deoxy-2’-fluoronucleoside-5’-diphosphates (fdndp), 2’-chloro-2’-deoxynucleoside-5’-diphosphates (cldndp), 2’-deoxy-2’-methylenenucleoside-5’-diphosphate (ch2fdndp), and 2’-deoxy-2’-mercaptonucleoside-5’-diphosphate (shdndp), the presence or absence of
reductants does not preclude enzyme inhibition. the formation of the common furanone derivative with a characteristic
uv/visible absorbance band at 320–330 nm is not observed.
further electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) studies
show that, in the absence of reductants, an unusual stable
radical species is observed with no equivalent amongst other
similar rnr inhibitors.
previous theoretical work[22] was devoted to the study of
the gemcitabine inhibitory mechanism in the absence of reductants. however, as inside the cell reductants are available, it is likely that r1 inactivation is the most favorable
mechanism responsible for drug cytotoxicity in vivo. taking
this into account, this paper is devoted to the unknown inhibition mechanism that occurs in  xxxd2188xxx , in the presence of
reductants. some experimental results are available on this
subject, however, this inhibitory pathway is still unclear.

theoretical approach
theoretical model: small models were used to simulate the
desired reactions. cysteine and glutamate residues were
modeled as methylthiols and formate molecules, respectively. the dfdcdp molecule was modeled without the c-5’
atom, the phosphates, and the cytosine groups. the adequacy of these models was demonstrated in earlier works.[20, 23, 24]
furthermore, it was shown recently that the difference in
either activation energy or reaction energy between a model

that includes explicitly the whole r1 monomer at the qm/
mm level (12 000 atoms) and a smaller model the size of the
present one (up to 40 atoms), embedded in a dielectric
medium with e = 4, is less than 1.5 kcal mol 1. nevertheless,
special care was taken here so that the relative position of
each residue could be reproduced in the x-ray structure,[25]
and the most important direct interactions were included explicitly in the model. the other, long-range interactions
coming from the bulk of the protein were calculated by diachtungreelectric continuum methods.[26] these kinds of models allow
for the evaluation of the energy with a higher level of
theory, in contrast to the practical use of qm/mm methodologies.
theoretical methods: density functional theory (dft) was
used in all geometry optimizations. the chosen functional
was the b3 lyp with the 6–31g(d) basis set, as included in
the gaussian 03 package.[27] final energies were corrected
by single-point energy calculations at a very high level of
theory, namely the qcisd(t)[28] level, and with a larger polarized valence triple-x aug-cc-pvtz basis set.[29, 30]
frequency calculations confirmed the nature of each stationary point, that is, an energy minimum with all frequencies real or, in the case of a transition state, with only one
imaginary frequency. the transition states were verified to
connect the reactants and products of interest through internal reaction-coordinate calculations (irc). zero-point, thermal, and entropic effects (t = 298.15 k, p = 1 bar) were
added to the calculated energies.
a scale factor of 0.9804 was used to eliminate known systematic errors in zero-point energies and thermal-energy
corrections. a problem associated with the unrestricted
wave functions is spin contamination. the expected values
of the spin in the optimized structures never exceeded 0.76
and after annihilation they returned to the desired value of
0.750.
the atomic spin-density distributions were calculated at
the b3 lyp level by employing a mulliken population analysis, using the basis set 6–311 + + g (3df,3pd).
a polarized-continuum model was employed, referred as
c-pcm, as implemented in gaussian 03,[27] to calculate the
final energies. in this approach, the continuum is modeled
as a conductor, instead of a dielectric. this simplifies the
electrostatic computations, and corrections are made a posteriori for dielectric behavior. a dielectric constant of four
has shown previously to provide theoretical results hat are
in agreement with their experimental counterparts, taking
care of the protein (e = 3) and the buried waters environments (e = 80).[23]

recently, pereira et al.[22] showed that the gemcitabine inhibitory mechanism, in the absence of reductants, is similar
to that of the natural reduction pathway (scheme 1). the
first part of the mechanism involves the abstraction of the
h-3’ atom by cys439 (1) and the hydrogen-atom transfer
from oh-3’ to glu441 (2). this sequence of steps occurs, in
most of the substrate analogues, as two consecutive steps
but, in the case of gemcitabine, the hydrogen-atom transfer,
promoted by glu441, occurs prior to the cys439 abstraction.
this can be explained by the electrowithdrawing nature of
the groups attached to the c-2’ atom that influence the acidity of the neighboring c-3’ atom. the third step involves the
release of the fluorine atom that is attached to the bottom
face of the substrate (3). this step is assisted by the protonated cys225 and yields one molecule of hf. in the fourth
step, there is a hydrogen-atom transfer between cys225 and
cys462 (4) and in the next step this hydrogen becomes attached to carbon c-2’ of the substrate. at this stage, both
sulfur atoms become connected by an anionic-radical disulfide bridge, which is experimentally detected by epr spectroscopy (5). as in the natural substrate, the next step involves the oxidation of both cysteines with the simultaneous
proton transfer from glu441 to the o-3’ atom of the substrate (6). in the final step, the dissociation of the other fluorine atom with the help of cys439 occurs, generating another molecule of hf (7). we propose that the mechanism must
diverge subsequently at this
point, depending on the availachtungreability of reductants, according
to scheme 2.
it is experimentally known
that in the absence of reductants the inhibition is due predominantly to the reduction of
the radical and, therefore, the
inhibition of monomer r2. monomer r1 remains active, but
the overall activity of the
enzyme is precluded. this inactivation is characterized by the
detection of an unusual epr
signal that is believed to be substrate based.[33, 34] the spectrum
is characterized by two hyperfine interactions of the same
magnitude with nuclei of spin 1/
2. the location of the radical is
uncertain, but theoretical results have shown that the radical should be located at the c4’ atom, with two hydrogen
atoms, connected to c-5’, being

gated enzymes and it serves as a prototype for the mammalian protein.
rnr class ia is composed of a complex of two subunits
from which the enzymatic activity is dependent (figure 2).
one of the subunits, r1, controls the overall enzyme activity
and is composed of two identical monomers, each one lodging one active site containing five conserved residues
(cys225, asn437, glu441, cys439, and cys462), and three
independent allosteric sites. the other subunit, r2, is also
composed of two identical monomers, each one containing a
stable neutral tyrosyl free radical coupled to a binuclear
iron cluster that is required for its generation.
rnr can be inhibited at an early stage during the transcription of mrna (antisense inhibitors) or when the protein is already formed, either by precluding subunit dimerization (dimerization inhibitors) or by direct attack on protein r1 or r2. gemcitabine is part of the latter group and is
capable of inhibiting protein r1 and protein r2. from the
large database of rnr inhibitors, gemcitabine is the most
potent mechanism-based inhibitor known to date.[31] the
puzzling inhibitory mechanism of gemcitabine has been
under discussion for decades and, although several pieces of
this puzzle have been unraveled, the solution remains far
from clear.[32–34]

scheme 1. rnr inhibitory mechanism promoted by gemcitabine, up to the formation of the cys225–cys462 disulfide bridge.

starting from structure 7 (pathway c, scheme 2). from this
point, it was proposed by pereira et al. that the first step
would involve the hydrogen-atom transfer from cys439 to
c-2’ of the substrate. subsequently, there is a hydrogenatom abstraction from c-4’ in the substrate by cys439. this
reaction is possible due to the reactivity of the c-4’atoms
and the very stable nucleotide-based radical that is formed
in the product of the reaction, and definitely prevents the
regeneration of the tyrosyl radical in protein r2.
experimental results have shown that in the presence of
reductants protein r1 is inhibited, whereas protein r2 remains active, contrary to what happens in the absence of reductants. as inside the cell reductants are available, it is
likely that r1 inactivation is the most favorable mechanism
responsible for drug cytotoxicity, which increases the interest in this inhibition process.
experimentally, the inactivation is proposed to be distinctive from the majority of other 2’-substituted nucleotides, involving reactive species that are generated within the active
site (protein r1) and never leave this site although reductants are available. this theory is supported because the formation of a chromophore in solution, common amongst
other substrate-analogue inhibitors, is not observed in gemcitabine. furthermore, the unique detection of cytosine and
fluorine molecules in solution, but not of pyrophosphate or
sugar derivatives, suggests the alkylation of species inside
the active site.

to unravel the inhibitory mechanism in the presence of
reductants we studied several possible pathways, as well as
their energetics, and tried to find the most favorable pathway from a kinetic point of view. here we discuss the three
most favorable pathways that we followed.
as mentioned above, the point after which the mechanism
is proposed to diverge depending on the availability of reductants, is structure 7. at this point the radical is located at
the c-2’ atom of the substrate and the charge at cys439.
the glu441 is protonated, both cysteines are connected by a
disulfide bridge, and the substrate is found as a radical ketodeoxyribonucleotide.
in the presence of reductants, the reduction of cysteines
cys225 and cys462 becomes a possibility. the commonly accepted dithiol/disulfide exchange mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack of a thiolate on the disulfide complex,[35]
generating a cross-linked intermediate, as depicted in
scheme 3. accordingly, cys225 becomes necessarily anionic.
furthermore, at this stage and taking in account the pka of
thiols and of hf, cys439 remains protonated.
from this point on, three possible pathways can be envisioned to trap the nucleotide inside the active site and generate a covalent adduct (scheme 2, pathway c): the anionic
cys225 adds to 1) atom c-2’ (pathway a) or 2) atom c-3’ of
the substrate (pathway b), or there is a hydrogen-atom
transfer from cys439 to atom c-3’ of the substrate. the
latter pathway (pathway c) is the same as the one proposed
to occur in the absence of reductants.

to study these pathways we built models capable of simulating the modeled reactions with a very high level of
theory. because a compromise between the size of the
model and the accuracy of the results is necessary, we used
systems which do not contain more than 40 atoms. this
choice was made because, in rnr, the size of the model is

chem. eur. j. 2007, 13, 8507 – 8515

not important for this kind of study. this conclusion is based
on our past experience in which several steps of the normal
reduction pathway of the rnr mechanism were studied by
using increasing sizes of the modeled enzyme.[20, 23, 24] the results showed that there is little significant difference between the calculated energies obtained for the full enzyme
and for this kind of model; only a difference of
1.5 kcal mol 1 was observed.[23] the advantage of this procedure is to allow for the evaluation of the energy with a
higher level of theory and, therefore, with much more accuracy, as an alternative to the use of qm/mm methodologies.
theoretical calculations showed that the starting points of
pathways a and b are very similar. the anionic cys225 is
very close to the substrate and two positions are available
for a nucleophilic attack: the c-2’ carbon atom at a distance
of 2.75 q and the c-3’ carbon atom at a distance of 3.25 q.
the hydroxyl group of glu441 is in close contact with the
ketone group of the substrate, with the hydrogen atom only
1.51 q away. the spin density and the charge are shared between the substrate (0.42 and 0.58 a.u., respectively) and

cys225 (0.59 and
0.50 a.u., respectively). this shared
charge/spin distribution together with the observed bond
lengths between the atoms c-2’ c-3’ and c-3’ o-3’ indicates the existence of two resonance structures (scheme 4).

scheme 4. resonance structures of molecule 7.

however, at the obtained minimum, the distance between
atoms c-3’ and o-3’ (1.28 q), which is typical of partial
double-bond lengths comprising a carbon and an oxygen
(1.29 q), the distance between atoms c-2’ and c-3’ (1.38 q),
shorter than a common single-bond length (1.64 q) and
closer to a double-bond length between two carbons
(1.34 q), and the charge and spin-density concentration in
the substrate at atoms c-3’and o-3’, show that molecule 7 a
is the most stable structure in that particular environment.
step 1: in pathway a, the transition state for the nucleophilic addition of the cys225 thiolate is characterized by a
unique imaginary frequency of 968.59 cm 1 that involves
(figure 3): 1) the addition of cys225 to carbon atom c-2’ of
the substrate, 2) the proton transfer from glu441 to the
ketone group of the substrate, and 3) the radical transfer to
carbon atom c-2’ of the substrate. the spin density is shared

between the substrate (0.61 a.u.) and cys225 (0.39 a.u.), and
the charge is located mainly at glu441 ( 1.02 a.u.). interestingly, in the transition state the substrate shows a lack of
electronic density (0.54 a.u.) contrary to what happens with
cys225 ( 0.46 a.u). at this stage, cys225 is almost bonded
to the carbon atom c-2’ of the substrate (2.19 q) and the
hydroxyl group is already formed at atom c-3’ of the substrate, with the hydrogen atom kept at 1.34 q from glu441.
the activation free energy involved in this process is very
small, corresponding to 2.48 kcal mol 1.
in pathway b, cys225 adds to carbon atom c-3’ of the
substrate. the transition state involves two simultaneous
transformations around carbon c-3’achtungre(figure 3): 1) the addition of the anionic cys225 to atom c-3’ and, similarly to the
other pathway, 2) the hydrogen-atom transfer from glu441
to the ketone group of the substrate. the radical remains located at carbon c-3’ (0.69 a.u.) of the substrate and, as in
pathway a, the charge becomes located at glu441
( 1.04 a.u.) because the proton is already transferred to
atom o-3’. the anionic cys225 is aligned with atom c-3’ at
2.17 q. the activation free energy in this step is small
(6.16 kcal mol 1), but higher by about 4 kcal mol 1 than the
corresponding one in the other pathway. despite being
small, this energy reflects the lower stability of intermediate
12 relative to structure 9. this is due mainly to the presence
of the hydroxy group at carbon c-3’ that makes this step
less favorable, from a stereochemical point of view.
due to the different positions of the nucleophilic attack in
the two pathways, two different structures are obtained as
products. in pathway a, cys225 is bonded to carbon c-2’ of

the substrate (c-2’ s = 1.85 q). the spin is mainly located
at carbon c-3’ of the substrate (0.79 a.u,) and the charge remains located at glu441 ( 1.03 a.u.). the reaction is exothermic, and the products are more stable than the reactants
( 2.36 kcal mol 1). in pathway b, cys225 bonds to atom c3’ of the substrate (c-3’ s = 1.97 q). the spin remains located at the c-2’ carbon atom of the substrate (1.06 a.u.) and
the charge is concentrated at glu441 ( 1.03 a.u.). contrary
to what happens in pathway a, the reaction is endothermic,
+ 1.41 kcal mol 1.
the zero-point energy, thermal corrections, and continuum effect (already included in the above-mentioned energy
values) increase the value by + 1.34 kcal mol 1 for the activation energy and by + 2.46 kcal mol 1 for the reaction free
energy in pathway a, and by + 0.97 kcal mol 1 and
+ 0.70 kcal mol 1, respectively, in pathway b.
step 2: following pathway a, the next step involves the hydrogen-atom transfer from cys439 to carbon c-3’ of the substrate, generating the deoxyribonucleotide derivative, but
with cys225 bonded to atom c-2’. this step is similar to the
last step of the normal reduction pathway and from which
the regeneration of the radical, experimentally observed, is
achieved. in the reactants, the thiol group of cys439 is
found 2.70 q away from carbon c-3’ of the substrate. the
spin is located at carbon c-3’ (0.79 a.u.) and the charge at
glu441 (1.04 a.u.). at the transition state, the hydrogenatom transfer occurs in an almost perfectly collinear fashion
with an s-h-c angle of 1758, with the hydrogen atom located 1.53 q away from the sulfur atom (cys439) and at 1.45 q
from carbon c-3’ (figure 4). the spin distribution is divided
between the sulfur atom (0.21 a.u.) and carbon c-3’

(0.69 a.u.), revealing the proximity and interaction of both
atoms. in the optimized geometry of the products, the spin
density is located at cys439 (0.97 a.u.) and the charge remains located at glu441 ( 1.08a.u.). the hydrogen is now
bonded to carbon c-3’ of the substrate (1.10 q) and at
4.11 q from the sulfur atom of cys439. the calculated freeenergy barrier necessary to achieve the transition state is
+ 13.17 kcal mol 1 and the reaction free energy is
11.67 kcal mol 1. the zero-point, thermal corrections, and
continuum effect increased the barrier by + 1.77 kcal mol 1
for the activation energy and by + 2.89 kcal mol 1 for the reaction free energy.
in pathway b, the final step involves the hydrogen-atom
transfer from cys439 to atom c-2’ of the substrate. this step
is very similar to the last step of the inhibition reaction pathways of both cldndp and fdndp in which it was shown
that cys439 has sufficient mobility to reach carbon c-2’ of
the substrate.[36] in the reactants, the spin density is located
at carbon c-2’ (0.85 a.u.) of the substrate, being the thiol
group of cys439 at 3.39 q from this center. the charge remains located at glu441 ( 1.04 a.u.). at the transition state,
the distance between carbon c-2’ and the hydrogen atom is
1.56 q, and the thiol bond length is elongated to 1.49 q
(1.36 q in the reactants) (figure 4).the spin density is
shared between carbon c-3’ of the ribonucleotide (0.62 a.u.)
and the sulfur of cys439 (0.23 a.u.), showing the proximity
and interaction of both atoms. in the products, we observe
the presence of the thiyl group (spin density of 0.97 a.u.) in
cys439 and the new c h bond (1.09 q) at the substrate.
the activation energy required for this step is + 16.0 kcal

2’ or c-3’ of the substrate was shown to be possible, which
precludes the dissociation of the gemcitabine derivative
from the active site into the solution. the involvement of
cys225 in the alkylation of ribonucleotides is not new and a
similar behavior was also proposed in the inhibitory mechanism of ch2fdndp33.

conclusions

figure 5. free energies, dg, of the discussed pathways, subsequent to the
point at which the inhibitory mechanism diverges, depending on the
availability of reductants (pathway a, black; pathway b, gray). structures
shown in scheme 2 are also identified.

during the first step of the inhibitory mechanism, when
reductants are present, it is not clear which pathway, a or
b, is favored, as both the activation energy (4 kcal mol 1)
and the reaction energies (  3 kcal mol 1) are rather small.
in the second step, irrespective of the pathway followed, the
final products have similar stabilities ( 10.90 kcal mol 1 for
structures 13 and 11.67 kcal mol 1 for structure 10). however, the activation energy in pathway a is smaller by about
3 kcal mol 1, which makes this pathway more favorable kinetically. furthermore, the inhibitory mechanism of pathway
a has several advantages over pathway b, from both a stereospacial and a stereochemical point of view. for example,
the bond length between the sulfur atom from cys225 and
the carbon atom from the substrate (c-2’ in pathway a and
c-3’ in pathway b) is smaller in pathway a (1.85 q) than in
pathway b (1.97 q), which may make the former compound
less stable than the latter. these facts might cause pathway
a to be preferred when reductants are available.
the studied pathways allow us to elucidate why, in the
presence of reductants, stoichiometric inactivation of r1 is
distinct from the majority of the other 2’-substituted 2’-deachtungreoxynucleotides, and the formation of new species in solution, such as the furanone derivative (besides cytosine and
both fluorines), is not observed. cys225 plays the main role
in this process and its covalent addition to carbon atoms c-

this study has allowed us to unravel the inhibitory mechanism of gemcitabine in the presence of reductants and to
clarify differences and similarities when reductants are
absent. we can conclude that both inhibitory mechanisms
have similar pathways at an initial stage but diverge after
the formation of the radical-ketodeoxyribonucleotide 7. this
explains why the mode of rnr inactivation by gemcitabine
is reductant dependent.
in the presence of reductants we propose that cys225 is
responsible for substrate alkylation within the active center.
this explains why for each equivalent of gemcitabine no
other molecule is detected in solution besides cytosine and
two molecules of fluorine. we have studied several inhibitory pathways and have observed that in the presence of reductants two competitive inhibitory pathways are available.
from a stereospacial and a stereochemical point of view, we
can conclude that the nucleophilic attack of the anionic
cys225 on carbon c-2’ is the most favorable pathway.
with this study we are able to explain why gemcitabine is
the most efficient inhibitor relative to the other rnr substrate-analogue inhibitors. the main reason deals with the
fact that once gemcitabine binds into the active site it no
longer dissociates into the solution, because it becomes trapped by covalent bonding to cys225. with the other inhibitors, the most common inhibitory mechanism involves the
formation of a ketodeoxyribonucleotide derivative. however, in these cases, this compound must dissociate into the solution, where it decomposes to a methylene-3achtungre(2 h)-furanone
derivative that inhibits the enzyme only when reductants are
absent, a situation that does not occur in vivo.
