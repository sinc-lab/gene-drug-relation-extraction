abstract
phosphodiesterase-5 (pde5) contains a catalytic domain (c
domain) that hydrolyzes cgmp and a regulatory domain (r
domain) that contains two mammalian cgmp-binding phosphodiesterase, anabaena adenylyl cyclases, escherichia coli
fhlas (gafs) (a and b) and a phosphorylation site for cyclic
nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (cnpks). binding of
cgmp to gaf-a increases cnpk phosphorylation of pde5 and
improves catalytic site affinity for cgmp or inhibitors. gaf-b
contributes to dimerization of pde5, inhibition of cgmp binding
to gaf-a, and sequestration of the phosphorylation site. to
probe potential pde5 r domain effects on catalytic site affinity
for certain inhibitors, four n-terminal truncation mutants were
generated: pde5⌬1-321 contained gaf-b domain, c domain,
and the sequence between gaf-a and -b; pde5⌬1-419 contained gaf-b and c domain; pde5⌬1-465 contained the c

intracellular levels of cgmp are determined by the relative
rates of synthesis by guanylyl cyclases and breakdown by
cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (pdes) (francis et al.,
2001; rybalkin et al., 2003; mullershausen et al., 2005).
pde5, a cgmp-specific pde, plays a prominent role in cgmp
breakdown in numerous tissues, including smooth muscle,
platelets, gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and cerebellar
purkinje cells (hanson et al., 1998; wyatt et al., 1998; rythis work was supported by national institutes of health grants dk40299
and dk58277 and by american heart association postdoctoral fellowship

domain and the c-terminal portion of gaf-b; and pde5⌬1-534
contained only c domain. truncated proteins with a complete
gaf-b were dimers, but those lacking the n-terminal 46 amino
acids of gaf-b were monomers, indicating that these residues
are vital for gaf-b-mediated pde5 dimerization. km values of
the mutants for cgmp were similar to that of full-length pde5.
all pde5 constructs had similar affinities for  xxxd2388xxx , sildenafil, tadalafil, and uk-122764, but mutants
containing a complete gaf-b had 7- to 18-fold higher affinity
for vardenafil-based compounds compared with those lacking
a complete gaf-b. this indicated that the n-terminal 46 amino
acids in gaf-b are required for high vardenafil potency. this is
the first evidence that pde5 r domain, and gaf-b in particular,
influences affinity and selectivity of the catalytic site for certain
classes of inhibitors.

balkin et al., 2003; sopory et al., 2004). pde5 is the target of
erectile dysfunction medications [e.g., sildenafil (viagra),
tadalafil (cialis), vardenafil (levitra), and  xxxd3464xxx  ( xxxd3464xxx )]; sildenafil (revatio) has recently been approved for
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (jeremy et al.,
1997; ballard et al., 1998; corbin and francis, 1999; turko et
al., 1999; kang et al., 2003; rotella, 2003; sebkhi et al., 2003;
kendirci et al., 2004; galie et al., 2005). pde5 is a homodimer; each monomer contains a regulatory (r) domain
and a catalytic (c) domain that is highly conserved in all
class i pdes (corbin and francis, 1999; francis et al., 2001).
the r domain contains several functional subdomains, including 1) a consensus site for phosphorylation by cyclic
nucleotide-dependent protein kinases; exposure of this site

materials. [ h]cgmp and deae-sephacel were purchased from
ge healthcare (little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk).  xxxd2388xxx , histone type ii-as, crotalus atrox snake venom, 5⬘-gmp, and cgmp
were obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). full-length recombinant bovine pde5 was isolated from infected sf9 cells using
ni/nta agarose (qiagen, valencia, ca) as described previously
(blount et al., 2004). sildenafil (fig. 1) was purified from tablets of
viagra following the method previously established in this laboratory (corbin et al., 2003). purified sildenafil was submitted to ge
healthcare for radiolabeling with tritium. tadalafil (fig. 1) was
synthesized according to daugan (2000). after confirming the compound structure by mass spectrometry, tadalafil was submitted to
ge healthcare for radiolabeling with tritium. high-performance
liquid chromatography results from ge healthcare indicated that
[3h]sildenafil was ⬎98% pure, whereas the [3h]tadalafil preparation
was ⬎99% pure. vardenafil, [3h]vardenafil, demethyl-vardenafil,
and bay 51-1871 (fig. 1) were kindly provided by bayer ag (wuppertal, germany). uk-122764 (fig. 1) was generously provided by
pfizer central research (sandwich, uk). all three 3h-labeled inhibitors that had been stored for more than a year were subjected to
sephadex g-25 chromatography, which adsorbs these pde inhibitors and provides purification with high resolution (corbin et al.,
2003). all three 3h-inhibitors were resolved in single peaks and

for phosphorylation is regulated by ligand binding; 2) two
gafs (a and b); and 3) dimerization contacts (thomas et al.,
1992; mcallister-lucas et al., 1995; corbin and francis,
1999; zoraghi et al., 2005). gafs are composed of ⬃120
amino acids and named for the proteins in which they were
first found (i.e., cgmp-binding phosphodiesterase, anabaena
adenylyl cyclases, escherichia coli fhlas) (aravind and ponting, 1997; martinez et al., 2002; zoraghi et al., 2004). although gafs comprise a large family of protein modules,
little is known about their functions or physical features. in
some instances, gafs have been shown to bind small ligands
such as cgmp or camp (yamazaki et al., 1982; francis et al.,
2002; martinez et al., 2005; gross-langenhoff et al., 2006).
gaf-a in pde5 binds cgmp with high affinity and contributes to dimerization. allosteric cgmp binding in gaf-a increases affinity of the pde5 catalytic site for the cgmp
substrate or inhibitors and regulates exposure of the phosphorylation site (turko et al., 1998; rybalkin et al., 2003;
blount et al., 2004; zoraghi et al., 2005). dimerization of
pde5 occurs through multiple contacts within the r domain,
and both isolated gaf-a and gaf-b are dimers.
kinetic properties [i.e., kcat, km for cgmp; ic50 for sildenafil or  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx )] of pde5 isolated c domain resemble those of full-length pde5 (fink et
al., 1999). in x-ray crystal structures of pde5 isolated c
domain, sildenafil and vardenafil have similar modes of binding despite a 10- to 40-fold difference in affinities (in vitro
potencies) of full-length pde5 for these inhibitors (sung et
al., 2003; blount et al., 2004; huai et al., 2004). despite the
apparent similarity in contacts between these inhibitors and
pde5 catalytic site, site-directed mutagenesis of several of
these residues in the pde5 holoenzyme produces selective
losses in affinities for these inhibitors (corbin et al., 2005;
zoraghi et al., 2006). this suggests that the x-ray cocrystallographic images derived from the isolated c domain may not
contain or reveal structural nuances that affect inhibitor
potencies in the pde5 holoenzyme.
pde5-selective inhibitors bind to the catalytic site and do
not measurably interact with the allosteric cgmp binding
sites (turko et al., 1999; blount et al., 2004). however, the
possibility that interaction of different classes of inhibitors
with the catalytic site may be selectively affected by the r
domain has not been studied. to address this possibility, we
hypothesized that features within the r domain influence the
affinity of the pde5 catalytic site for certain classes of inhibitors. in addition, we considered the possibility that in some
instances, dimerization of pde5 contributes to affinity and
selectivity of the catalytic site for inhibitors. to test these
ideas, four n-terminal truncation mutants of pde5 were
generated and tested for affinities of a collection of pde
inhibitors with varying structures [ xxxd2388xxx , two sildenafilbased inhibitors (sildenafil and uk-122764), tadalafil, and
three vardenafil-based inhibitors (vardenafil, demethyl-vardenafil, and bay 51-1871] (fig. 1). the mutants were also
analyzed for their quaternary structures. we report here that
gaf-b in pde5 r domain played a key role in determining
higher affinity and selectivity of pde5 for vardenafil-based
compounds versus sildenafil-based compounds or tadalafil,
that a 46-amino acid segment in the n-terminal portion of
gaf-b accounted for this effect, and that the same 46 amino
acids were required for gaf-b-mediated dimerization of
pde5.

all constructs were prepared in the sf9 expression system as outlined
under materials and methods with the exception of isolated c domain,
which was purified from both e. coli and infected sf9 cells as also outlined
under materials and methods.

the optimum volume of viral stock determined experimentally. sf9
cells were harvested at 72 to 96 h postinfection by centrifugation at
2000 rpm in a beckman ja-10 rotor (beckman coulter, inc., fullerton, ca) for 10 min at 4°c. the pellet was dispersed with a pipette
using 10 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm tris, ph 8, 100 mm nacl, and 15
mm ␤- xxxd26xxx ) and homogenized twice for 4 s using an
ultraturrax (tekmar, cincinnati, oh). after centrifugation at 9000
rpm in a beckman ja-20 rotor for 20 min, the supernatant was
collected and applied to a 0.9 ⫻ 3-cm ni-nta agarose column (qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. the column was washed with 20
ml of lysis buffer before eluting with 30 ml of this buffer containing
0.1 m imidazole. fractions (2 ml) were collected; fractions were
analyzed for cgmp pde catalytic activity, protein content, and purity (using sds-page). fractions exhibiting peak enzyme activity
and protein purity were pooled, and glycerol was added to a final
concentration of 20%. aliquots were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at ⫺70°c.
isolated c domain. one of the isolated c domain constructs
(human glu535-gln860) (fig. 2) used in these studies was kindly
provided by dr. hengming ke (university of north carolina, chapel
hill, nc). the plasmid was transformed into e. coli strain bl21
(codonplus) for overexpression. escherichia coli containing the vector was grown in enriched lb medium (10 g of bacto-tryptone, 5 g of
bacto-yeast extract, 10 g of nacl per liter with 0.4% glucose, and 100
mg of amp added after autoclaving) at 37°c to a600 ⫽ 0.7, and then
0.1 mm isopropyl ␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for further
growth at 15°c overnight. cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm in a
beckman ja-10 rotor for 10 min at 4°c. the resulting pellet from 3
liters of sf9 cells was dispersed with 4 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm
tris, ph 8, 0.3 m nacl, 15 mm imidazole, 1 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx ,
and 1 edta-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet per 50
ml of solution; roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in) by pipetting up
and down. cells were homogenized by sonication using a branson
sonifier 450 (branson ultrasonics corporation, danbury, ct) by
pulsing for 1 min four times. after centrifugation at 9000 rpm in a
beckman ja-20 rotor for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to a
ni-nta agarose column (0.9 ⫻ 3 cm) (qiagen) equilibrated with
extraction buffer. the column was then washed with 150 ml of buffer
1 (20 mm tris, ph 8, 0.3 m nacl, 15 mm imidazole, and 1 mm
␤- xxxd26xxx ) followed by a 50-ml wash with buffer 2 (20 mm
tris, ph 8, 50 mm nacl, 15 mm imidazole, and 1 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx ). the isolated c domain was eluted in 1-ml fractions from the
ni-nta column with buffer containing 20 mm tris, ph 8, 0.3 m
nacl, 150 mm imidazole, and 1 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx . fractions
were subjected to sds-page, protein, and pde activity analyses.
fractions that contained the isolated c domain were pooled and
quick-frozen in 20% glycerol.
a his-tagged isolated c domain of slightly different length (human glu535-gln875) was also prepared by sf9 expression using
human pde5 cdna (tanabe-seiyaku pharmaceutical co. ltd.,
saitama, japan) as a template. this construct was amplified by
polymerase chain reaction using primers that introduce ecori and
noti restriction sites to the 5⬘ and 3⬘ ends, respectively. the dna
was then transformed in dh5␣bac cells and purified as outlined
above. after being confirmed by sequencing, sf9 cells (bd biosciences pharmingen) were cotransfected with baculogold linear
baculovirus dna (bd biosciences pharmingen) and isolated c domain dna according to the protocol from bd biosciences pharmingen. virus was amplified and titered as outlined above. after purifying the cells and subjecting the lysate to ni-nta affinity
chromatography as discussed above, the protein yield was low. to
ensure that results obtained within this study with isolated c domain expressed in e. coli were not artifacts of the expression system,
isolated c domain in crude lysate of sf9 cells infected with this
construct was used to verify the results.
pde activity assays. pde activity assays were initiated by
addition of the desired pde5 construct to a reaction mixture (100 ␮l)
containing 40 mm mops, ph 7, 0.8 mm egta, 15 mm magnesium

coeluted with purified unlabeled inhibitors, suggesting that the 3hlabeled inhibitors were unaltered after storage.
constructs of pde5. full-length human pde5a1 cdna
(tanabe-seiyaku pharmaceutical co. ltd., saitama, japan) was the
template used to generate his-tagged pde5a1 truncation constructs
(fig. 2). constructs were created by introduction of start and stop
codons at the appropriate loci. primers introduced ecori and noti
sites to the start and stop codons, respectively. the resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was inserted into a pachlt-a vector (bd biosciences pharmingen, san diego, ca) that was linearized
by digestion with ecori and noti. the boundaries for gaf-a and
gaf-b were selected based on homology with other gaf-containing
pdes (pde2 and pde6) because the precise boundaries of these
modules are not known (zoraghi et al., 2005). mutants included
pde5⌬1-321 containing the intervening sequence between gaf-a
and -b, gaf-b, and the c domain; pde5⌬1-419 containing a complete gaf-b and c domain but lacking the intervening sequence
between gaf-a and -b; pde5⌬1-465 containing the c-terminal portion of the gaf-b sequence and the c domain, isolated c domain
(pde5⌬1-534); full-length r domain (pde5⌬540-875); and an isolated gaf-b construct containing flanking sequences on both sides
of the module (thr322-gly539) (fig. 2). the full-length isolated r
domain (pde5⌬540-875) and isolated gaf-b mutants were prepared and characterized as described previously (zoraghi et al.,
2005).
all constructs were confirmed by dna sequencing before cotransfection into sf9 cells with baculogold linear baculovirus dna (bd
biosciences pharmingen) by the calcium phosphate method according to the protocol from bd biosciences pharmingen. at 5 days
postinfection, the cotransfection supernatant was collected, amplified three times in sf9 cells, and then used directly as viral stock for
expression without additional purification of recombinant virus. sf9
cells grown at 27°c in complete grace’s insect medium with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 10 ␮g/ml gentamicin (sigma-aldrich) in
t-175 flasks (corning glassworks, corning, ny) were infected with

volume 200 ␮l) as internal standards. the column was eluted with
the same buffer, and fractions (0.8 ml) were collected. elution positions for the constructs were determined by assaying pde catalytic
activity.  xxxg569xxx  and  xxxg818xxx  were located by absorbance at
400 nm. the column was standardized with protein standards of
known stokes radii:  xxxg569xxx  (16.6 å),  xxxg1836xxx -c subunit (27 å), ovalbumin (29 å), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (35 å), type i
cgmp-dependent protein kinase-␤ (50 å), and catalase (52 å). thyroglobulin was used to determine the void volume, whereas [3h]h2o
was used to determine the inclusion volume. elution positions of the
protein standards were used to generate a standard curve of (⫺log
kav)1/2 versus stokes radius as in eq. 1:

the stokes radius of each protein was determined from the standard
curve.
determination of sedimentation coefficient. each protein
(⬃20 ␮g) was combined with two internal standards, aldolase (2
mg/ml), and  xxxg569xxx  (5 mg/ml) in a volume of 300 ␮l in 20 mm
tris, ph 8, and 100 mm nacl and applied to a 13-ml linear 5 to 20%
sucrose gradient containing 20 mm tris, ph 8, and 100 mm nacl.
the gradients were centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in a beckman sw 41
rotor for 36 h at 4°c, and fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the
bottom of the tubes.  xxxg569xxx  has a sedimentation coefficient of
1.86 s and was located by absorbance at 400 nm. to detect aldolase
(7.35 s), an aliquot (20 ␮l) of each fraction was submitted to 10%
sds-page analysis and stained with coomassie blue. the intensity
of the band was quantified using metamorph software (molecular
devices, sunnyvale, ca). the proteins of known s20,w— xxxg569xxx 
(1.86 s),  xxxg1836xxx -c subunit (3.14 s), ovalbumin (3.5 s),
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (4.6 s), pkg i␤ (7.0 s), and catalase (11.3
s)—were centrifuged using the same conditions and used as additional standards. to locate the peak of protein for each construct,
pde activity assays were performed as described above. the sedimentation coefficient of each protein was then determined by the
distance migrated into the gradients compared with the position of
the standards. the molecular mass of each protein was calculated
using the siegel and monty equation, which uses the experimentally
determined stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient (siegel and
monty, 1966) (eq. 2):

where n is avogadro’s number; n is the viscosity of medium, assumed to be 1; a is stokes radius; s is sedimentation coefficient; ␳ is
density of the medium, assumed to be 1; and ␷ is partial specific
volume, assumed to be 0.725 ml/g. the predicted relative molecular
mass was determined using compute pi/mw (http://www.expasy.org/
tools/pi_tool.html) based on the amino acid composition. this was
compared with the experimentally determined relative molecular
mass of the proteins to establish whether each recombinant protein
was monomeric or dimeric.
calculation of free energy of binding. the gibbs free energy
change, ⌬g, that occurs by association of a ligand with pde5 is
related to the equilibrium association constant for the interaction
and was calculated using eq. 3 (gerstner et al., 1994):

acetate, 2 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma-aldrich), [3h]cgmp
(amersham) (80,000–150,000 cpm/assay tube), and various concentrations of unlabeled cgmp. reaction mixtures were incubated at
30°c for 15 min or an appropriate time. a mixture (20 ␮l) with the
following ingredients was added to terminate the reaction: 50 mm
edta, 30 mm theophylline (sigma-aldrich), 10 mm cgmp, and 10
mm camp in 100 mm tris, ph 7.5. snake venom 5⬘-nucleotidase
(200 ␮g; sigma-aldrich) was added to the assay mixture and incubated for 10 min at 30°c. assay samples were diluted in 1 ml of
dilution solution (0.15 mm edta containing 100 ␮m each of adenosine and guanosine) and applied to qae-sephadex columns (8 ⫻ 33
mm) pre-equilibrated in 20 mm ammonium formate buffer, ph 7.4.
eluates were collected, aqueous scintillant was added (10 ml), and
the amount of [3h]guanosine was measured in a scintillation
counter. to determine ic50 values for various inhibitors, the
[3h]cgmp substrate concentration was 0.4 ␮m; increasing concentrations of the respective inhibitors were diluted in the pde assay
mixture and then added to the assay. the km for each construct was
determined using a range of cgmp concentrations. unless indicated
otherwise, pde activity is expressed as picomoles per minute per
milliliter of enzyme in the reaction tube.
[3h]cgmp binding assays. to measure allosteric cgmp binding, millipore filter binding assays were conducted in a total volume
of 50 ␮l of reaction mixture that contained 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 6.8, 1 mm edta, 0.5 mg/ml histone type ii-as, 30
mm dl-dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sildenafil, and either 3 ␮m (for binding
stoichiometry determination) or 0.05 to 4 ␮m (for binding affinity
determination) of [3h]cgmp. the binding reaction was initiated by
addition of enzyme and incubated on ice for 60 min. then, 1 ml of
ice-cold kp buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, ph 6.8) was added
to each sample, and samples were filtered immediately onto premoistened millipore hawp filters (pore size 0.45 ␮m). filters were
then washed with 2 ml of ice-cold kp buffer two times, dried, and
counted using nonaqueous ready safe scintillation cocktail (beckman coulter, inc.). counts bound to pde5 were corrected by subtraction of nonspecific binding (⫹1 mm unlabeled cgmp). blanks
containing no pde5 were run for each [3h]cgmp concentration.
[3h]cgmp binding in pde5 holoenzyme and isolated r domain indicated a stoichiometry and affinity for cgmp binding similar to
those of full-length pde5 (zoraghi et al., 2005). there was no significant cgmp binding detected in pde5⌬1-321, pde5⌬1-419,
pde5⌬1-465, isolated c domain, or isolated gaf-b module.

h-inhibitor membrane filtration binding assays. fulllength pde5 or isolated c domain (80 ␮l) was added to 2 ml of a
binding reaction mixture that contained 0.2 mg/ml histone iia-s,
various concentrations of 3h-inhibitor, and buffer that consisted of
10 mm potassium phosphate, ph 6.8, and 25 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx 
(kpm). 3h-inhibitor was added after addition of reaction mixture
because it adhered to the test tube when added in the absence of or
before addition of histone. histone also increased retention of pde5
on the millipore filters. binding reaction mixture containing the
enzyme was incubated on ice for 45 min. millipore nitrocellulose
membranes (0.45 ␮m) were placed under house vacuum and prewetted with 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm kp, ph 6.8, that contained 0.1%
triton x-100. next, 200 ␮l of room temperature 25% triton x-100 in
kpm was added to the reaction tube. the entire contents of the tube
were quickly applied to the prewetted filter. the reaction tube was
then rinsed with 3 ml of ice-cold 0.1% triton x-100 in kp, and the
rinse was also applied to the filter. filter membranes were removed,
dried, and transferred to 6-ml scintillation vials. nonaqueous scintillant (5 ml) was added to the vials, which were then placed in a
scintillation counter.
determination of stokes radius. the stokes radii of the pde5
proteins were determined using a standardized sephacryl s-200 gel
filtration column (0.9 ⫻ 35 cm) equilibrated in a solution containing
20 mm tris, ph 8, and 100 mm nacl. each sample applied to the
column contained ⬃50 ␮g of one of the pde5 constructs as well as 5

physical and kinetic characteristics of the pde5
constructs. full-length pde5 and four truncation mutants
were subjected to sds-page analysis. migration of each of
the proteins agreed with the predicted molecular weights
based on amino acid composition, and purity of each was
⬎90% (data not shown). to verify that the affinity of the
catalytic site of the full-length pde5 and all n-terminal
truncation mutants of pde5 for cgmp was not impaired, km
for cgmp was determined as described under materials and
methods in head-to-head experiments. km values for cgmp
were similar among pde5⌬1–321 (2.5 ⫾ 1.8 ␮m), pde5⌬1419 (2.2 ⫾ 2.2 ␮m), pde5⌬1-465 (2.3 ⫾ 1.4 ␮m), isolated c
domain (⌬1-534) (2.5 ⫾ 0.7 ␮m), and full-length pde5 (2.5 ⫾
0.8 ␮m). these values were derived from two different preparations of all constructs and each assay was performed in
triplicate (n ⫽ 4). the km for full-length pde5 was consistent
with values previously determined in this laboratory
(thomas et al., 1990).
effect of the r domain in pde5 holoenzyme on affinity of the catalytic site for inhibitors. ic50 values for
seven pde inhibitors representing four distinct chemical
structures were determined in parallel for full-length pde5
and the four n-terminal truncation mutants as outlined in
materials and methods by using 0.4 ␮m [3h]cgmp as substrate (table 1). the core ring structure of  xxxd2388xxx  is a xanthine, which closely resembles the guanine of cgmp (fig. 1).
the sildenafil-based compounds (sildenafil and uk-122764)

contain a pyrazolopyrimidinone ring system, whereas the
vardenafil-based compounds (vardenafil, demethyl-vardenafil, and bay 51-1871) contain an imidazotriazinone ring
system; the heterocyclic ring systems in the sildenafil-based
and vardenafil-based compounds differ substantially from
each other and from those of cgmp and  xxxd2388xxx . the ring
system of tadalafil is different from those of all of the other
compounds (fig. 1). the structural differences in these core
ring systems confer unique chemical characteristics on the
compounds. the ic50 values of  xxxd2388xxx , a weak, nonspecific
pde inhibitor; for full-length pde5, pde5⌬1-321, pde5⌬1419, pde5⌬1-465; and for isolated c domain (⌬1-534) were
very similar (table 1). the value for full-length pde5 agreed
with that in our previous report (turko et al., 1999). the ic50
values of tadalafil for full-length pde5, pde5⌬1-321,
pde5⌬1-419, pde5⌬1-465, and isolated c domain (⌬1-534)
were also similar (table 1). ic50 values for two sildenafilbased compounds (sildenafil and uk-122764) were also the
same for all constructs, including the isolated c domain
(table 1). these results demonstrated that the pde5 r domain does not significantly affect the potency of inhibition by
 xxxd2388xxx , tadalafil, or sildenafil-based compounds.
in contrast, the ic50 values of the three vardenafil-based
compounds for the proteins of different lengths differed
markedly. the ic50 of vardenafil for full-length pde5 (0.3 ⫾
0.1 nm) was similar to the previously reported value (blount
et al., 2004). pde5⌬1-321 and pde5⌬1-419 had ic50 values
for vardenafil that were very similar to that for full-length
pde5 (0.2 ⫾ 0.1 and 0.4 ⫾ 0.1 nm, respectively) (table 1).
however, the shorter constructs that lacked a complete
gaf-b [i.e., pde5⌬1-465 and the isolated c domain (⌬1534)] yielded ⬃10-fold higher ic50 values (2.7 ⫾ 0.5 and 2.9 ⫾
0.3 nm, respectively) (table 1). the ⬃10-fold difference between the ic50 of vardenafil for full-length pde5 compared
with that for the isolated c domain is also illustrated in
fig. 3.
ic50 values for two other vardenafil-based compounds
were also determined in head-to-head experiments. the
first compound, demethyl-vardenafil, contained the [5,1f][1,2]triazine ring of vardenafil and the appended methyl
group of sildenafil (fig. 1). previous studies established that
demethyl-vardenafil inhibits full-length pde5 with the same
potency as does vardenafil (corbin et al., 2004); ic50 values

pde5 inhibitor affinity is influenced by gaf-b domain

fig. 3. vardenafil potency of inhibition for full-length pde5 and isolated
c domain. full-length pde5 (pde5) or isolated pde5 c domain (c
domain) (10 ␮l; 0.1 nm final concentration in assay) was added to the
pde assay reaction mixture containing increasing concentrations of
vardenafil. pde activity was determined in a 15-min incubation as described under materials and methods using 0.4 ␮m (final concentration)
[3h]cgmp as substrate. data represent experiments performed in triplicate where n ⫽ 3 experiments.

7.3 ⫾ 3.4 nm (n ⫽ 3). this ⬃7-fold increase in kd of isolated
c domain for vardenafil was similar to the ⬃10-fold increase
in the ic50 of vardenafil described above.
vardenafil affinity of pde5⌬1-465 or isolated pde5
c domain is not affected by addition of either excess
isolated r domain or isolated gaf-b. the possibility
that addition of isolated r domain or gaf-b module to the
isolated c domain could restore high affinity of the catalytic
site for vardenafil was tested. approximately 160-fold (6.4
nm) excess purified recombinant isolated r domain
(pde5⌬540–875) or ⬃245-fold (10 nm) excess purified isolated gaf-b (pde5⌬thr322-gly539) was preincubated with
0.04 nm isolated c domain for 45 min on ice. aliquots of these
mixtures were then added to tubes containing the pde catalytic assay mixture with either no vardenafil or varying
concentrations of vardenafil. identical assays using fulllength pde5 were performed alongside in a head-to-head
manner (fig. 4). ic50 values of vardenafil for full-length
pde5 and isolated c domain were 1.5 ⫾ 0.1 nm and 9.6 ⫾ 1.7
nm, respectively. addition of either isolated gaf-b module
(ic50 ⫽ 9.1 ⫾ 1.0 nm) or isolated r domain (ic50 ⫽ 9.2 ⫾ 1.1
nm) did not alter vardenafil potency. addition of excess r
domain or isolated gaf-b module also did not affect catalytic
activity of either full-length pde5 or pde5 c domain (data
not shown). integrity of the isolated r domain was verified by
demonstrating that the protein is dimeric and binds cgmp
with high-affinity, high-specificity, and ⬎0.5 mol/mol binding
stoichiometry.
physical properties of n-terminal truncation mutants of pde5. molecular mass of each of the four n-terminal truncation mutants was calculated as described under
materials and methods using the experimentally determined
stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient for each. when
pde5⌬1-321 was chromatographed on a standardized gel
filtration column, the protein eluted at a position similar to
that of the internal standard  xxxg818xxx  (fig. 5a), and it had
a calculated stokes radius of 46.9 ⫾ 0.46 å (table 2). upon
sucrose density gradient centrifugation, pde5⌬1-321 sedimented near the internal standard aldolase (fig. 6a) and had
a calculated sedimentation coefficient of 5.83 ⫾ 0.15 s (table
2). using the siegel and monty equation, the calculated mo-

(0.3 ⫾ 0.1 nm) determined here agreed with those previous
findings. demethyl-vardenafil had a similar ic50 (0.6 ⫾ 0.2
nm) for pde5⌬1-321 and pde5⌬1-419 (0.4 ⫾ 0.1 nm). however, pde5⌬1-465 and the isolated c domain (⌬1-534), both
of which lacked an intact gaf-b, had ⬃10-fold higher ic50
values (5.6 ⫾ 1.2 and 3.2 ⫾ 0.5 nm, respectively).
bay 51-1871 also contains the [5,1-f][1,2]triazine ring of
vardenafil, but a carbonyl group replaces the methyl group
(fig. 1). the ic50 values determined for full-length pde5,
pde5⌬1-321, and pde5⌬1-419 for bay 51-1871 were all
similar (0.4 ⫾ 0.3, 0.5 ⫾ 0.1, and 0.4 ⫾ 0.2 nm, respectively).
in contrast, the ic50 values for pde5⌬1-465 and the isolated
c domain (⌬1-534) were 3.1 ⫾ 0.8 and 2.9 ⫾ 0.4 nm, respectively.
full-length pde5 has higher binding affinity for
[3h]vardenafil than does pde5 isolated c domain.
the affinity of vardenafil for full-length pde5 and isolated c
domain was examined via direct binding studies using
[3h]vardenafil and the membrane filtration binding assay
described under materials and methods. maximum [3h]vardenafil binding to both proteins was ⬃0.5 mol/mol pde5
monomer. the specificity of [3h]vardenafil binding was validated by testing the effects of various unlabeled pde inhibitors. this included a 10,000-fold excess of heterocyclic inhibitors that are selective for pde5 (vardenafil, sildenafil, and
tadalafil) as well as other heterocyclic inhibitors that are
selective for other pdes [ xxxd3142xxx  (pde4), milrinone
( xxxg1695xxx ),  xxxd1974xxx  (pde2), or
vinpocetine (pde1)]. high concentrations of  xxxd3142xxx , milrinone,  xxxd1974xxx , or vinpocetine
did not affect [3h]vardenafil binding (3 nm), whereas unlabeled vardenafil, sildenafil, or tadalafil blocked more than
90% of the binding (data not shown). a 100,000-fold excess of
either camp, 5⬘-gmp, or  xxxd2388xxx  had no effect on [3h]vardenafil binding to either isolated c domain or full-length
pde5 (data not shown).
the kd of [3h]vardenafil was determined for isolated c
domain and full-length pde5 by performing a binding isotherm with increasing concentrations of [3h]vardenafil in the
absence of cgmp in a head-to-head manner. the kd obtained
for full-length pde5 was 1.1 ⫾ 0.2 nm (n ⫽ 3), a value similar
to that previously determined in this laboratory (blount et
al., 2004). the kd of vardenafil for isolated c domain was

protein was 43.6 kda (table 2). the predicted molecular
mass (47.2 kda) was similar to the calculated value, indicating that pde5⌬1-465 was a monomer.
by gel filtration chromatography, isolated c domain eluted
near  xxxg569xxx  (fig. 5d), and the stokes radius was
calculated to be 24.5 ⫾ 0.51 å (table 2). by sucrose density
gradient centrifugation, this protein sedimented near standard  xxxg569xxx  (fig. 6d) and had a sedimentation coefficient of 2.6 ⫾ 0.15 s (table 2). the relative molecular mass
for isolated c domain was determined to be 26.8 kda (table
2), which was similar to the predicted molecular mass (37.7
kda), indicating that this construct was monomeric.

discussion
the n-terminal truncation mutants of pde5 used in this
study contained all of the essential structural requirements
for hydrolytic function and had affinities for cgmp like that
of full-length pde5. these results indicated that interactions
of sildenafil-based inhibitors, tadalafil, or  xxxd2388xxx  with pde5
are located exclusively within the c domain.
it is surprising that a portion of the high-affinity inhibition

lecular mass of pde5⌬1-321 was determined to be 113 kda
(table 2); this value was approximately twice that of the
predicted molecular mass of a monomer of this construct
(63.7 kda) based on amino acid composition, indicating that
this mutant was a dimer.
pde5⌬1-419 eluted from the standardized gel filtration
column at a position near that for  xxxg818xxx  (fig. 5b). the
stokes radius for this construct was calculated to be 44.7 ⫾
1.45 å (table 2). upon sucrose density centrifugation, this

pde5 inhibitor affinity is influenced by gaf-b domain

binding to the isolated c domain versus the full-length pde5
(shown herein) demonstrates that, at least for vardenafil,
some contacts that contribute to inhibitor potency in the two
forms of the enzyme differ substantially. these conclusions
are supported by studies using site-directed mutagenesis of
either gln817 or tyr612, in the catalytic site of pde5 (corbin
et al., 2005; zoraghi et al., 2006). according to the x-ray
crystal structures, the contacts between gln817 or tyr612
with vardenafil and sildenafil seem to be identical. however,
substitution of either of these residues by an alanine causes
a significantly greater loss in affinity for inhibition by vardenafil than for sildenafil; the loss in affinity for vardenafil
and sildenafil for the q817a mutant is ⬃600- and ⬃50-fold,
respectively. these data support the interpretation that the
mode of binding for these inhibitors differs significantly.
the present studies reveal that all or some of the amino
acid sequence extending from glu420 through gly466 is critical for potent inhibition by vardenafil-based compounds.
this finding adds to the growing evidence that different
regions of the pde5 r domain influence catalytic function.
several regulatory functions, including phosphorylation and
ligand binding, that are contained in r domains have been
shown to affect the catalytic sites of many pdes. however,
there is no known mechanism by which this 46-amino acid
segment in pde5 affects the catalytic site. this stretch of
amino acids could provide 1) direct contacts with vardenafilbased compounds that contribute to more optimal positioning
of these inhibitors in the catalytic binding pocket, 2) structural features for the formation of a stable gaf-b structure
that could in turn directly affect catalytic site function or
make contact with the inhibitor, 3) dimerization contacts
that impact conformation and affinity of the catalytic site for
vardenafil-based compounds, or 4) a combination of these
mechanisms. the reported evidence herein provides new insights into the 10-fold higher potency of vardenafil over sildenafil and generates new considerations pertaining to the
design and evaluation of potency of future inhibitors.
the present results expand appreciation for the role of the
fig. 6. sucrose density gradient centrifugation of pde5⌬1-321, pde5⌬1419, pde5⌬1-465, and isolated c domain (⌬1-534). twenty micrograms of
either pde5⌬1-321 (a), pde5⌬1-419
(b), pde5⌬1-465 (c), or isolated c domain (⌬1-534) (d) were subjected to
sucrose density gradient centrifugation (5–20%) as described under materials and methods. internal standards included in each sample are 2
mg/ml aldolase and 5 mg/ml  xxxg569xxx . after centrifugation, 0.5-ml
fractions were collected. to determine
position of the internal standard aldolase, 20 ␮l of fraction was loaded on a
10% sds-page gel and stained with
coomassie blue. the resulting protein bands were quantified as described under materials and methods.
absorbance at 400 nm was used to
determine the elution position of  xxxg569xxx . to determine the location of
the n-terminal truncation construct,
pde assays were performed according to the protocol described under
materials and methods. each graph is
representative of one of three experiments performed for each construct.

of pde5 by the three vardenafil-based compounds requires
the r domain. direct determination of the kd for [3h]vardenafil binding supported the results ascertained using ic50
values. other high-affinity pde5 inhibitors with structures
dissimilar to vardenafil are currently unavailable for testing;
therefore, it cannot be concluded whether the effect of gaf-b
applies to high-affinity inhibitors per se or whether this is a
unique property associated with the novel structure of the
heterocyclic rings of vardenafil based-structures. taken together, the data show that a significant portion of the highaffinity interaction of vardenafil with the pde5 catalytic site
requires an intact gaf-b within the r domain.
these findings are the first to show that the affinity and
selectivity of the enzyme for different classes of inhibitors is
significantly influenced by r domain features. the differential impact of the r domain on the affinity of the pde5
catalytic site for different classes of inhibitors may not be
unique to pde5. r domains of many pdes vary markedly in
length among variants within a given pde family; therefore,
potencies of a particular class of inhibitor may vary significantly among these proteins, and isolated c domains should
be used cautiously in screening for inhibitor potency. this is
supported by studies of the pde4 family in which n-terminal
truncations of pde4 holoenzyme revealed important influences of the upstream conserved region 2 domain in highaffinity  xxxd3142xxx  binding to the pde4 catalytic site (richter
and conti, 2004). the results emphasize the need for careful
analysis of structural differences in pdes that could potentially affect potencies of different classes of pde inhibitors.
these results along with those from a number of other
recent reports also emphasize the limitations in conclusions
drawn from cocrystal structures of the isolated c domain of
pdes and their inhibitors (corbin et al., 2005; zoraghi et al.,
2006). the cocrystal structures of pde5 isolated c domain
with either sildenafil or vardenafil suggested that these two
bind in the same manner (i.e., make the same contacts with
the same amino acids in the catalytic site binding pocket).
however, the dramatic difference in the affinity of vardenafil

r domain and gaf-b in pde5 function. the region containing gaf-b and its flanking amino acids modulates the affinity of cgmp binding by gaf-a and also regulates the
cgmp-dependent exposure of ser102 (human pde5) for
phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (zoraghi et al., 2004). some evidence suggests that
cgmp binds to the gaf-b domain with low affinity, but this
is yet to be proven (mcallister-lucas et al., 1995; turko et al.,
1998); however, it should be noted that low-affinity cgmp
binding might not be detected by methods that have been
used. the present finding that high potency of pde5 inhibition by vardenafil-based compounds requires a portion of the
sequence in the gaf-b domain is the first proven effect of
gaf-b on the catalytic domain of pde5. taken together, the
results support and emphasize the complex and central role
of gaf-b in pde5 function.
previous results from this laboratory and those contained
in this article strongly suggest that gaf-b participates in
dimerization of pde5. the studies herein reveal that the
same 46-amino acid segment in the n-terminal portion of
gaf-b that is required for high vardenafil potency is also
required for the gaf-b-mediated pde5 dimerization. although this correlation could be coincidental, the possibility
that enhanced vardenafil affinity requires pde5 dimerization should be considered. the critical segment of 46 amino
acids may be directly involved in contacts providing for
dimerization, or they may be required for the structural
integrity of pde5 gaf-b that can in turn form a dimer
interface involving this or other areas in gaf-b. recent
experiments with pde4 demonstrated that disruption of
an ␣-helix in the r domain of that enzyme disrupts dimerization (richter and conti, 2004). a computational program (tmhmm server version 2.0; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/tmhmm/) did not predict an ␣-helix in this 46amino acid segment of pde5, and this segment of sequence
lacks other distinguishing features such as a high degree of
hydrophobicity or charge.
the mechanism by which gaf-b influences potent selectivity for certain classes of pde5 inhibitors is also unknown.
the increase in the gibbs free energy of binding provided by
gaf-b (⬃1.8 kcal/mol) is less than that provided by an additional h-bond (2.5– 4 kcal/mol), but nevertheless it is a
substantial increase. because the holoenzyme is the pharmacological target, rational drug design of new pde inhibitors
must fully appreciate that subtle differences between pde
holoenzymes and their isolated c domains can profoundly
affect inhibitor potency and selectivity.
