abstract: the effect of the nicotinic receptor agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium iodide (dmpp) on the resting release of
[ 3h]noradrenaline from superfused hippocampal slices was
studied in rat. continuous administration of dmpp at a concentration range of 1–100 mm increased the [ 3h]noradrenaline release in a dose-dependent manner. the response to dmpp was
characterized by an immediate steep increase (peak response)
followed by a sudden decline to a lower level that was constant
with time (tail response) and still was significantly higher than
the spontaneous release. further analysis revealed that the release of noradrenaline in response to dmpp consists of two
components. while nicotinic receptor antagonists ( xxxd2550xxx  10 mm, pancuronium 10 mm,  xxxd2959xxx  10 mm), the
nonselective ca-antagonist cd 2/ (125 mm) and tetrodotoxin
(ttx, 1 mm) completely abolished the peak response (phase i),
they had no effect on the tail response (phase ii). ca 2/-free medium containing 1 mm egta also blocked phase i but in contrast
with other drugs enhanced phase ii. the release during phase i
is subject to presynaptic feedback modulation, since the a2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine (3 mm) inhibited the dmpp-evoked
stimulation of [ 3h]noradrenaline release, that inhibition was antagonized by a selective a2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ({)-[7,8(methylenedioxy)-14-a-hydroxyalloberbane hydrochloride [({)ch-38083] (2 mm). ({)-ch-38083 (2 mm) alone significantly
enhanced the dmpp-evoked increase of [ 3h]noradrenaline release. phase ii was not affected by a2-adrenergic drugs.
whereas the noradrenaline uptake blockers despramine (dmi,
1–10 mm), nisoxetine (1–10 mm), and  xxxd2746xxx  (10 mm) inhibited both phases,  xxxd2746xxx  at a concentration of 1 mm
selectively blocked only phase ii. our data indicate that dmpp
has a dual effect on the hippocampal noradrenaline release:
phase i is a transient, nicotinic receptor-mediated exocytotic release, and phase ii is a maintained, carrier-mediated process. q 1997 elsevier science inc.

are able to increase noradrenaline release from guinea pig vas
deferens [22], cat spleen slices [5], rat vas deferens [14], rabbit
heart [4], guinea pig heart [16], bovine cerebral artery [19],
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus [10], human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y [23], and rat hippocampus in vitro [1,18] and
in vivo [11].
because the hippocampal noradrenaline release enhances
memory retention [8] and the cholinergic projections of hippocampus play a very important role in memory functions and
learning [17], the interaction of these neurotransmitter systems
in hippocampus has a special significance.
in our previous study [26] we investigated the effect of nicotinic receptor agonists on the noradrenaline release from hippocampal slices. we found that nicotinic agonists increased the
noradrenaline release through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and we classified the subtype of  xxxg456xxx  involved in this process on the basis of the rank
order of potencies of different nicotinic agonists and antagonists.
in these experiments dimethylphenylpiperazinium iodide
(dmpp), a potent nicotinic receptor agonist [13] induced a more
complex response than the other agonists (e.g., in contrast with
nicotine, anatoxin-a,  xxxd1792xxx , and epibatidine the dmpp-evoked
increase of noradrenaline release was, in part, insensitive toward
nicotinic antagonists and [ca 2/ ]o-independent). because no attempt had so far been made to analyze in detail these characteristics of dmpp in the central nervous system, the aim of this
study was to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the dmppevoked noradrenaline release from rat hippocampal slices.

and transferred into a four-channel microvolume perfusion system [24]. four slices were put into each chamber, the preparation
was superfused with krebs solution at 377c at a rate of 0.6 ml/
min for 60 min (preperfusion period), and the effluent was discarded. subsequently 19 3-min fractions were collected. supramaximal (20 v) field stimulation (2 ms, 2 hz for 3 min) was
applied during the third fraction in each experiment to test the
responsivity of the tissue. dmpp was added from the 10th fraction; other drugs (except uptake blockers) were applied from the
eight fraction. uptake blockers were present in the medium from
the beginning of preperfusion period. at the end of experiments
slices were removed from the chamber and were homogenized
in 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. a 0.5 ml aliquot of the
superfusate or 0.1 ml of the tissue supernatant was added to 2 ml
of scintillation coctail (ultima gold, packard). tritium was measured with a packard 1900 tr liquid scintillation counter using
an internal standard. radioactivity was expressed in terms of disintegration per second per gram of tissue (bq/g). the fractional
release was expressed in terms of the percentage of tritium present in the tissue at the beginning of a given collection period.
statistical analysis
fractional release (fr) data were normalized to decrease
variance between subjects. the average of three fractions before
treatment was taken as 100% and all fractions were expressed
relative to this value as normalized fractional release (nfr) data.
the average fr data of different treatment groups were not significantly different; the overall value was 0.83 { 0.01% per 3
min (n å 86). the nfr data were analyzed using an area under

results
effect of dmpp on the resting release of noradrenaline from
rat hippocampal slices
after 45-min of loading with [ 3h]noradrenaline, followed by
a 60-min preperfusion, the slices contained 312477 { 12759 bq/
g (n å 74) radioactivity. by use of hplc combined with radiochemical detection it was established that 92.8 { 3.8% (n å 8)
of the total radioactivity originated from [ 3h]noradrenaline.
dmpp at concentrations of 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm increased
the release of noradrenaline in a dose-dependent manner (fig.
1). because dmpp at a concentration of 20 mm gave near halfmaximal response, this concentration was used in the subsequent
experiments. the time course of the response to dmpp was characterized by an immediate onset and a sudden decline (peak response) followed by a persistent release (tail response), which
was still significantly higher than the spontaneous noradrenaline
efflux (figs. 2–5).
effect of nicotinic antagonists on dmpp-evoked
noradrenaline release
we investigated the involvement of nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors in dmpp-evoked noradrenaline release using nicotinic
receptor antagonists. these experiments indicated two phases for
the dmpp-evoked noradrenaline release. whereas the peak response (phase i) to dmpp was completely inhibited by  xxxd2550xxx  (10 mm), pancuronium (10 mm), and  xxxd2959xxx 
(10 mm), the tail response (phase ii) was not influenced by these
drugs. in the presence of nicotinic antagonists the onset of noradrenaline release was slow, but it was maintained over the 30min period of dmpp perfusion (figs. 2–3, table 1).
effect of ca 2/-free medium, cd 2/ , and ttx on dmppevoked noradrenaline release

the response to dmpp we investigated the effect of ca 2/ -free

medium (plus 1 mm egta), cd 2/ (125 mm) and tetrodotoxin
(ttx) (1 mm). in the absence of ca 2/ and presence of egta
(1 mm) noradrenaline release developed slowly and was maintained until the tissue was exposed to dmpp. in the presence of
cd 2/ or ttx, i.e., under conditions in which the ca 2/ -influx or
axonal conduction was blocked, a similar response was observed.
these conditions abolished phase i but had no effect on phase ii,
except ca 2/ -free medium, which significantly increased the tail
response (fig. 4, table 1). under these conditions (ca 2/ -free,
cd 2/ or ttx) the time course of the dmpp-evoked noradrenaline release was very similar to those seen in the presence of
nicotinic antagonists.
effect of a2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on dmppevoked noradrenaline release

in this study we investigated the mechanisms involved in
dmpp-evoked noradrenaline release from rat hippocampal
slices. the response observed is characterized by an immediate
steep increase of noradrenaline release followed by a sudden decline (peak response) to a lower level that is constant with time
(tail response) and still significantly higher than the spontaneous
noradrenaline efflux. our experiments with nicotinic receptor antagonists ( xxxd2550xxx , pancuronium, and  xxxd2959xxx ) revealed that this dmpp-evoked noradrenaline release consists of
two components (fig. 3), because the peak response was abolished in the presence of nicotinic antagonists but the tail response
was not affected. thus, we conclude that the peak response
(phase i) is mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(the rapid decline corresponds to the desensitization of these receptors), whereas the tail response (phase ii) is independent of
these receptors (there is no desensitization).
characterization of phase i
there are two major types of release mechanisms: classical
exocytosis and carrier-mediated release. exocytosis is ca 2/ and
ttx dependent, subject to presynaptic modulation and not affected by uptake blockers, whereas carrier-mediated release is
ca 2/ and ttx insensitive, not subject to presynaptic modulation
but sensitive to uptake blockers [9].
because it is generally accepted that the vesicular release of
noradrenaline is [ca 2/ ]o-dependent and is subject to presynaptic
modulation [6], the effect of dmpp was measured in ca 2/ -free
solution and in the presence of the nonspecific ca 2/ -channel
blocker cd 2/ . phase i required extracellular ca 2/ because it was
abolished in ca 2/ -free medium, and cd 2/ also blocked this response.
our experiments with a2-adrenergic drugs [xylazine, ( {)ch-38083] show that phase i is subject to presynaptic a2-adrenoceptor-mediated feedback modulation. the a2-agonist xyla-

we investigated the presynaptic modulation of the dmppevoked noradrenaline release. the a2-agonist xylazine (3 mm)
decreased phase i significantly. this effect was reversed by the
potent a2-antagonist ( {)-[7,8-(methylenedioxy)-14-a-hydroxyalloberbane hydrochloride [( {)-ch-38083] (2 mm). the
latter drug alone inreased phase i significantly. the a2-adrenergic
drugs had no effect on phase ii (fig. 5, table 1).
effect of noradrenaline uptake blockers on the dmpp-evoked
noradrenaline release
in order to study the possible involvement of carrier-mediated
processes we investigated the sensitivity of the dmpp-evoked
noradrenaline release to noradrenaline uptake blockers. desipramine (dmi, 1 and 10 mm) completely blocked both phase i and
phase ii (table 1). nisoxetine significantly decreased both
phases at a concentration of 1 mm and completely blocked the
responses at a concentration of 10 mm (table 1). the response
to dmpp in the presence of dmi and nisoxetine was very similar
to that seen in the presence of  xxxd2746xxx  at a concentration of
10 mm (fig. 6); therefore, data are not shown.  xxxd2746xxx  completely blocked both phases at a concentration of 10 mm, but at

fig. 3. dual effect of dmpp on the noradrenaline release from hippocampal slices. the response has two components as revealed by nicotinic
antagonists (phase i was blocked, whereas phase ii was not affected by
 xxxd2550xxx , pancuronium, and  xxxd2959xxx ). open circle: dmpp
(20 mm), filled circle: resting release (in the absence of dmpp). the
figure also illustrates the way of calculation for the two phases.

area under curve of the two components (phase i and phase ii) were calculated separately
according to eqs. 2 and 3 in the methods section. the effects of dmpp at a concentration
of 20 mm (ed50) were regarded as control and all treatments were compared to these values

zine decreased, whereas the a2-antagonist ( {)-ch-38083
increased, the dmpp stimulated noradrenaline release.
because in addition to vesicular exocytosis neurotransmitter
release into the extracellular space may be due to reversal of
specific uptake carriers (carrier-mediated release) (reviewed by
levi and raiteri [9]), we examined the effect of noradrenaline

the anticholinergic effects of dmi has been known for decades,
these known effects are antimuscarinergic in nature. however,
recently whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that dmi inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [15]. it has been shown
that dmi could inhibit dmpp-evoked depolarization and noradrenaline release in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells [23]. it has
been reported that nicotine-induced exocytotic release of noradrenaline from isolated perfused guinea pig heart was inhibited by
dmi and nisoxetine [16]. these data and our results indicate that
dmi and nisoxetine possess  xxxg456xxx  antagonistic properties; therefore, we tested another uptake blocker,
 xxxd2746xxx , with a different chemical structure than dmi and
nisoxetine. although  xxxd2746xxx  is primarily used for inhibition
of dopamine uptake, it is also a potent noradrenaline uptake
blocker [3]. at a concentration of 10 mm  xxxd2746xxx , like dmi
and nisoxetine, completely inhibited both phases, but at a concentration of 1 mm it had no effect on phase i while it selectively
blocked phase ii (fig. 6). these results indicate that the ability
of dmi, nisoxetine, and  xxxd2746xxx  at high concentration to
block phase i is associated with their  xxxg456xxx  antagonistic properties and is independent from their uptake-blocking effect.
taken together, our data show that phase i is mediated
through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; furthermore, it is a
[ca 2/ ]o-dependent, ttx-sensitive release that is subject to presynaptic a2-adrenoceptor modulation. these results indicate that
phase i results from an exocytotic process.
characterization of phase ii
phase ii has a different time course than phase i (fig. 3). it
develops slowly and remains elevated as long as the tissue is
exposed to dmpp. it is not blocked by nicotinic antagonists,
ca 2/ -free medium, cd 2/ , ttx or a2-adrenergic drugs. these
data indicate that this release is not of the exocytotic type. its
sensitivity to uptake blockers shows that phase ii is associated
with the noradrenaline uptake carrier. it has already been observed that dmpp is able to block noradrenaline uptake in the
periphery [4]. according to langeloh and trendelenburg, all
substrates of noradrenaline uptake are able to induce a reversed

261

transport of noradrenaline [7]. it has been found [14] that dmpp
is able to release noradrenaline from rat vas deferens in ca 2/ free medium if the vesicular uptake and monoaminoxidase
(mao) are inhibited, but under normal conditions this effect is
very weak. our findings provide further evidence that dmpp is
able to induce carrier-mediated noradrenaline release. this is
supported by the fact that the response was potentiated by ca 2/ free medium, because the vesicular exocytosis is inhibited in
ca 2/ -free medium; therefore, the cytoplasmic pool, that is, the
source of carrier-mediated release, is increased. there is an interesting difference between the peripheral and central nervous
system. while dmpp induced substantial ca 2/ -independent release from vas deferens only if the vesicular uptake and mao
were inhibited, these were not necessary in case of hippocampus.
localization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors involved
in the dmpp-evoked noradrenaline release is an interesting question. selective lesion of cholinergic neurons in hippocampus did
not change the number and affinity of nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, indicating that these receptors are not located on cholinergic neurons [21]. because noradrenergic fibers are originated from the locus coeruleus, in our hippocampal slice preparation only the axon terminals are present. the ttx sensitivity
of phase i may indicate that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are
not located on the noradrenergic varicosities; however, it is also
possible that dmpp stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
on varicosities, the ligand-gated ion channels open, ca 2/ and
na / enter the varicosity [12], resulting in depolarization and
setting off propagated action potentials that are responsible for
noradrenaline release. a similar conclusion was reached by vizi
et al. [26]. supporting this view, in a recent report nicotinic
agonists induced na release from hippocampal synaptosomes,
indicating that the nicotinic receptors involved in this process are
located presynaptically on noradrenergic axon terminals [2].
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that dmpp increases
the hippocampal noradrenaline release in at least two different
ways. first, it provokes an exocytotic release through stimulation
of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and second, it is able to influence the function of noradrenaline uptake, resulting in a carrier-mediated increase of extracellular noradrenaline level.
