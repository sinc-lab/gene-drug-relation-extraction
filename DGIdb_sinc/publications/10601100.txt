contraceptive use often leads to disrupted endometrial
bleeding patterns in women. in this study, two different
contraceptive regimes (mircette, a monophasic oral contraceptive and implanon, a long-acting gestagen) were used
and their effects on the immunoreactivity of vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf),  xxxg730xxx  (er),
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) and endothelial cell number
were determined. during the untreated normal cycle, there
was a significant increase (p ⍧ 0.005) in glandular vegf
immunoreactivity and a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in
pr immunoreactivity in the mid- and late secretory phases
compared with the proliferative phase. there was a significant positive correlation (gamma ⍧ 0.38, p ⍧ 0.046) between
stromal vegf immunoreactivity and endothelial cell number. this correlation was also apparent during treatment
with implanon, but not with mircette. disrupted bleeding
patterns were associated with implanon and, to a lesser
extent, with mircette. both contraceptives significantly
reduced glandular vegf immunoreactivity. implanon significantly increased (p ⍧ 0.016) glandular pr staining, but
mircette significantly reduced (p ⍧ 0.027) stromal pr
staining when compared with secretory before-treatment
biopsies. there were no changes in endothelial cell number
or glandular or stromal er during the normal cycle, or
with use of either contraceptive. there was no association
between the parameters measured with bleeding patterns
and histological category.

introduction
discontinuation of oral contraception is often a result of
unwanted side-effects, such as breakthrough bleeding or spotting, or androgenic effects such as weight gain or acne (kaunitz,
1993).  xxxd1849xxx , a pro-drug whose active metabolite is
 xxxd2067xxx , was developed to provide a more selective
progestational activity and reduced androgenic activity that
3080

would improve cycle control and minimize metabolic changes
and adverse effects (wilde and balfour, 1995).  xxxd1849xxx 
and the newer progestagens also result in less pronounced
antagonism of the beneficial effects of ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx  on
lipid metabolism and the cardiovascular system (kuhl, 1996).
steroid hormones produced by the ovary regulate the menstrual cycle including the changes in the endometrial vasculature. differing levels, types and distribution of their
specific receptors, i.e. oestrogen receptors (er) alpha and beta, and
progesterone receptors (pr) a and b, presumably mediate
their actions together with locally produced polypeptide factors,
e.g.  xxxg681xxx  (egf; gordon et al., 1995).
 xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) is a potent angiogenic growth factor (ferrara et al., 1992). it is produced in
both glands and stromal cells of the endometrium, as well as
smooth muscle cells of the myometrium (charnock-jones
et al., 1993). vegf mrna is up-regulated in the immature
rat uterus in response to  xxxd2037xxx ,  xxxd2043xxx  and progesterone
(cullinan-bove and koos, 1993; hyder et al., 1996). vegf
is, therefore, a possible candidate as a mediator of steroid
hormone action on the endometrial blood vessels. alterations
in the normal distribution of vegf due to the administration
of synthetic steroids may be responsible for any resulting
aberrant bleeding.
the aims of the present study were to compare parameters
which may be important in endometrial bleeding: vegf,
oestrogen receptors (er), and progesterone receptors (pr) as
reflected by immunohistochemistry and endothelial cell number
in the endometrium; (i) throughout the normal menstrual cycle;
and (ii) after using two different contraceptives, implanon and
mircette. the effects of these parameters on the observed
bleeding patterns and histology were analysed.
materials and methods
subjects
normally menstruating women from the usa were recruited into
one of two separate study groups using different methods of contraception. the first 14 subjects used a progestin-only contraceptive,
implanon, a non-biodegradable implant with a duration of action of
3 years containing and releasing  xxxd2067xxx . the next 20 subjects
used mircette, a 21 day monophasic combined oral contraceptive
containing 20 µg ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx  and 150 µg  xxxd1849xxx , with
10 µg ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx /day administered for 5 days immediately
before the next pill cycle.
endometrial biopsies were taken on an out-patient basis by pipelle
before treatment and ~12 months after commencement. specimens
were formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin (56–57°c melting
point, surgipath medical industries, richmond, il, usa). sections

louis, mo, usa) coated slides. one section was stained with
haematoxylin and eosin for classification by a gynaecological histopathologist. these categories were normal proliferative, early
secretory (i.e. days dated 15–19), mid-secretory (days 20–22) and late
secretory (days 23–28; hendrickson and kempson, 1980), atrophic, or
oral contraceptive effect (i.e. consistent with exogenous progestin
administration). additional sections were used for immunohistochemistry as described below.
immunohistochemistry
 xxxg2413xxx 
sections were stained for vegf with an antibody directed against
amino acids 1–20 of mature human vegf and which therefore
recognizes the 121, 145, 165, 189 and 206 amino acid splice variants.
sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and washed in phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs). endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% hydrogen
peroxide in pbs (10 min), before application of primary antibody
(without prior antigen unmasking): rabbit anti-human vegf (a-20;
santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa), diluted to
0.5 µg/ml in 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa)–pbs, incubated for
1 h at 37°c. this was followed by a biotinylated secondary antibody:
goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg; zymed laboratories, san
francisco, ca, usa), 1/100 in pbs (10 min); then horseradish
peroxidase–streptavidin conjugate (zymed) 1/400 in pbs (10 min).
colour was developed with aminoethylcarbazole (aec) substrate
chromogen mix (zymed) for 5–10 min. sections were counterstained
with diluted mayer’s haematoxylin (1/20) for 1 min, then mounted
in aqueous mounting medium (clearmount mounting solution;
zymed). for negative controls 0.5 µg/ml normal rabbit igg was
substituted for the primary antibody.

oestrogen and progesterone receptors
separate sections were stained for  xxxg730xxx  and pr using mouse monoclonal antibodies: er 1d5 (dako, glostrup, denmark) and pr-at
4.14 (abr; golden, colorado, usa). antigen retrieval was carried
out by microwaving in 0.01 mol/l sodium citrate buffer (ph 6.0) for
10 min at 500 w. antibodies were diluted 1/50 in protein blocking
solution (1.5% normal horse serum, 2% bsa in pbs–tween) and
incubated overnight at 4°c after a 30 min pre-block. the secondary
antibody was biotinylated horse anti-mouse (vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca, usa), diluted 1/200 for 45 min. this was followed
by the vectastain elite abc complex (1/200, 30 min), then metalenhanced diaminobenzidine (pierce europe bv, oud beijerland, the
netherlands) in peroxidase buffer, 10 min and haematoxylin for
30 s. sections were dehydrated and mounted in depx (merck,
poole, uk).
the glandular epithelium and stromal cell compartments from each
stained section were scored subjectively on a scale of 0–4 by two or
three independent observers. for vegf, the scores were based on
the staining intensity of the majority of cells. for er and pr however,
modified h-scores were assigned (ravn et al., 1993). first an estimate
was made for the fraction (%) of stained cells in each compartment:
0 ⫽ 0–9%, 1 ⫽ 10–39%, 2 ⫽ 40–69%, 3 ⫽ 70–89%, and 4 ⫽ 90–
100%. second, the staining intensity (i) was scored: 0 ⫽ no staining,
1 ⫽ weak but definite staining, 2 ⫽ moderate staining, 3 ⫽ pronounced
staining and 4 ⫽ intense staining. the h-score was then calculated
by the formula (%⫻i) / 4. the averaged subjective scores were
analysed by the non-parametric wilcoxon test for paired samples
(before- versus after-treatment).
endothelial cell number
separate sections were stained to determine the number of
endothelial cell (ec) nuclei per mm2. the method used was

essentially as described previously (goodger macpherson and
rogers, 1994) and used an antibody which stains all endometrial
vessels. sections were treated as for vegf above, except the
primary antibody was mouse anti-human cd34 (qbend 10;
serotec, oxford, uk) diluted 1/25 in 1% bsa–pbs incubated for
45 min at 37°c, and the secondary antibody was biotinylated
rabbit anti mouse igg (zymed). all cell nuclei were stained with
undiluted haematoxylin. from these sections, an estimate of the
endothelial cell number was obtained, i.e. the number of ec nuclei
per mm2. each section was viewed under a microscope at ⫻400,

connected via a video camera to a personal computer and sampled
with software using a uniform systematic random sampling method
with a meander algorithm after outlining the section (grid
stereological software; interactivision, silkeborg, denmark). in this
way, 50 or 100 fields of known area per section were sampled
and ec nuclei counted by one observer.
bleeding records
daily records of vaginal bleeding were kept by each participant for
at least 13 cycles, with the following entries: no bleeding or spotting;

effects of contraceptives on human endometrium

spotting, requiring no more than one sanitary napkin or tampon per
day; or bleeding, requiring more than 1 sanitary napkin or tampon
per day. records were analysed using a 90 day reference period
immediately prior to the day of the after-treatment biopsy (biopsy
day ⫽ day 91). definitions used were as follows (rogers et al.,
1993): (i) a bleeding/spotting episode 1 or more consecutive days
during which blood loss (bleeding or spotting) was recorded, each
episode being bounded by two or more bleeding/spotting free days;
a single bleeding/spotting free day within a bleeding/spotting episode
being counted as part of the episode surrounding it; and (ii) a
bleeding/spotting free interval 2 or more consecutive days during
which blood loss had not occurred; each interval being bounded by
bleeding/spotting days.
bleeding during this 90 day reference period was categorized as:
(a) amenorrhoea – no bleeding/spotting; (b) prolonged – one or more
bleeding/spotting episodes lasting 10 days or more; (c) frequent –
more than four bleeding/spotting episodes; (d) infrequent – less than
two bleeding/spotting episodes; (e) irregular – range of length of
bleeding/spotting free intervals (i.e. greatest interval minus smallest
interval) ⬎17 days; (f) regular – two to four bleeding/spotting
episodes, no bleeding/spotting episode lasting 10 days or more, with
a range of length of bleeding/spotting free intervals of 17 days or less.
the bleeding patterns in the women receiving the oral contraceptive
were described as withdrawal bleeding, absence of withdrawal,
early withdrawal, breakthrough bleeding or continued withdrawal.
statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests to look
for possible relationships between the vegf, er, and pr glandular
and stromal staining and endothelial cell number, and their influence
on bleeding category and histological classification of the aftertreatment biopsy.

results
normal menstrual cycle
vegf immunoreactivity
all before-treatment biopsies (i.e. from normal cycles) from
both studies stained for vegf (n ⫽ 31 overall) were divided
into four histological groups based on the stage of the menstrual
cycle. the groups were normal proliferative (n ⫽ 8), early
secretory (n ⫽ 8), mid-secretory (n ⫽ 4) and late secretory
(n ⫽ 11). see table i for median scores and ranges for glands
and stroma. analysis of subjective vegf immunostaining
scores using the kruskal–wallis test showed that there was a
significant increase in glandular vegf immunostaining across
the cycle (p ⫽ 0.005); and dunn’s multiple comparisons test
showed that the staining during the mid- and late secretory
phases were significantly greater than that of the proliferative
phase (p ⬍ 0.05). there was no significant change in stromal
vegf staining.
er and pr immunoreactivity
pr immunoreactivity significantly decreased in the glands
across the normal cycle (p ⫽ 0.002; n ⫽ 26 overall; proliferative phase n ⫽ 8; early secretory n ⫽ 6; mid-secretory n ⫽ 4;
late secretory n ⫽ 8). dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed
that the staining during the mid- and late secretory phases was
significantly weaker than that of the proliferative phase
(p ⬍ 0.05, p ⬍ 0.01 respectively). there were no significant
changes in endometrial er across the normal cycle in glands
or stroma, or in the stromal pr staining. see table i for
median scores and their ranges.

endothelial cell number
there were no significant changes in endometrial endothelial
cell number across the normal cycle (n ⫽ 28 overall; proliferative phase n ⫽ 8; early secretory n ⫽ 7; mid-secretory n ⫽ 4;
late secretory n ⫽ 9). see table i for median scores and ranges.
correlations between immunohistochemical parameters
in order to look for possible relationships between the various
immunohistochemical parameters measured, spearman rank
correlation tests were used. there were significant positive correlations between glandular and stromal vegf staining
(r ⫽ 0.65, p ⬍ 0.0001), glandular er and glandular pr (r ⫽
0.57, p ⫽ 0.003) and stromal vegf and endothelial cell number
(r ⫽ 0.38, p ⫽ 0.046); and a negative correlation
between glandular vegf and glandular pr staining (r ⫽–0.49,
p ⫽ 0.01).
implanon study
patients (n ⫽ 14) participated, with a median age of 26.0 years,
range 18–40 years. detailed results showing averaged subjective
scores for vegf, er and pr staining in the glands and stroma,
together with their endothelial cell numbers, histological classification and bleeding summaries are shown in table i.
routine histology
all before-treatment biopsies were taken during the secretory
phase of the cycle as judged by routine histology. use of
implanon altered the histological appearance of the endometrium, resulting in reduced endometrial volume. a total of 11
after-treatment biopsies were judged to be atrophic, one weakly
proliferative, one proliferative and one menstrual.
immunohistochemistry
seven of the after-treatment biopsies were judged to be
inadequate, so these patients were excluded from analysis
where appropriate. no staining was seen in negative controls.
vegf staining was always cytoplasmic. see table i for
median scores and their ranges for the immunohistochemical
parameters in after-implanon treatment biopsies. there was a
significant reduction in vegf staining in the glands with
treatment (n ⫽ 6 before- versus after-treatment biopsy pairs,
p ⫽ 0.031). there was no change in stromal vegf staining
with treatment. see figure 1a–d for photomicrographs of
examples of vegf staining of endometrium from the same
patient before and after implanon treatment. specific er and
pr staining was always nuclear and an example of this is
shown in figure 2a–d. the glands showed significantly
increased pr staining with treatment (n ⫽ 7 pairs, p ⫽
0.016) and a trend (although not significant) towards increased
glandular er staining (n ⫽ 6 pairs, p ⫽ 0.063). there was
no change in stromal er and pr staining. endothelial cell
number did not change with treatment.
correlations between immunohistochemical parameters
there was a significant positive correlation (spearman rank
correlation) between endothelial cell number and stromal
vegf (r ⫽ 0.857, p ⫽ 0.024) in the after-treatment biopsies.
there were no other correlations between the immunohistochemical parameters measured in the after-implanon
treatment biopsies.

menstrual bleeding pattern versus immunohistochemical parameters
implanon disrupted the normal menstrual bleeding pattern in
all subjects and resulted in amenorrhoea in only four out of
14. kruskal–wallis analysis of variance showed that there
were no significant differences between the observed bleeding
categories during the 90 day reference period and any of
the immunohistochemical parameters measured in the afterimplanon treatment biopsies.
mircette study
twenty patients participated, with a median age of 29.5
years (range 23–47). detailed results showing averaged
subjective scores for vegf staining in the glands and stroma,
together with their endothelial cell numbers, histological
classification and bleeding summaries are shown in table i.
routine histology
eight before-treatment biopsies were taken during the proliferative phase of the cycle, 11 during the secretory phase, and
one was judged to be inactive. like implanon, mircette use
altered the histological appearance of the endometrium. of the
after-treatment biopsies, three were judged to be proliferative,
two secretory, seven atrophic, seven to show an exogenous
progestogen effect, and one an exogenous progestogen effect
with shedding.
immunohistochemistry
one of the after-treatment biopsies was judged to be inadequate
for immunohistochemical staining due to the small volume of
tissue, so this patient was excluded from analysis where
appropriate. no staining was seen in negative controls. see
table i for median scores and their ranges for the immunohistochemical parameters in the after-mircette treatment biopsies.
statistical analysis showed that overall there was a significant
reduction in vegf staining in the glands with treatment
(n ⫽ 19 before- compared with after-treatment biopsy pairs,
p ⫽ 0.007). however, this reduction with treatment is not
apparent when comparing only paired proliferative beforetreatment biopsies against after-treatment samples (n ⫽ 7, p ⫽
0.813), but is quite marked when comparing only paired
secretory before-treatment biopsies against after-treatment
samples (n ⫽ 11, p ⫽ 0.001). there was no significant
difference in vegf staining when comparing proliferative
before-treatment biopsies (n ⫽ 8) with secretory beforetreatment biopsies (n ⫽ 11, p ⫽ 0.129). nor was there any
significant change in stromal vegf staining with treatment.
see figure 1e–h for photomicrographs of vegf staining of
endometrium from the same patient before and after mircette
treatment.
overall, there were no changes in er or pr staining with
treatment in either the glands or stroma. there were no
significant changes in glandular er or pr when comparing
only paired proliferative before-treatment biopsies against
after-treatment samples, or paired secretory before-treatment
biopsies against after-treatment samples. there were also no
significant changes in stromal er or pr when comparing only
paired proliferative before-treatment biopsies against aftertreatment samples. however, when comparing only paired
3084

secretory before-treatment biopsies against after-treatment
samples, there was significantly reduced stromal pr staining
with treatment (p ⫽ 0.027) and a trend towards increased
stromal er staining with treatment (p ⫽ 0.065). endothelial
cell number did not change significantly with treatment.
correlations between immunohistochemical parameters
there was a significant positive correlation (spearman rank
correlation) between glandular egf and stromal vegf (r ⫽
0.61, p ⫽ 0.006) after treatment. there were no other significant
correlations between the immunohistochemical parameters
measured in the after-mircette treatment biopsies.
histological category versus immunohistochemical parameters
kruskal–wallis tests showed that the histological category
of the after-treatment biopsy did not influence any of the
immunohistochemical parameters.
menstrual bleeding pattern versus immunohistochemical parameters
mircette resulted in a regular bleeding pattern in the majority
of subjects (11/19, 58%). of the remaining subjects, seven
experienced bleeding in addition to withdrawal bleeding and
one woman failed to have regular withdrawal bleeding. bleeding pattern data were analysed against each of the immunohistochemical parameters by the unpaired non-parametric test
(mann–whitney) using two groups only: regular bleeders
versus the rest; due to the very low subject numbers in each
of several different bleeding categories. results showed that
there were no significant changes to the immunohistochemical
parameters with bleeding pattern, however there was a trend
towards increased stromal er staining with non-regular bleeding (p ⫽ 0.051).
discussion
during the normal menstrual cycle vegf immunoreactivity of
the endometrial glands changed significantly, with a significant
increase during the mid- and late secretory phases compared
to the proliferative phase. stromal vegf immunoreactivity
did not change through the cycle. these findings contrast with
those of other authors (li et al., 1994), who reported strong
vegf glandular staining that did not change during the cycle,
with the strongest stromal staining being found in discrete
cells during the mid-proliferative phase. however the pattern
of vegf staining reported here agrees with previous work
(shifren et al., 1996; torry et al., 1996), though these studies
had fewer subject numbers; and none of the previous studies
made any attempt at quantification. the findings of all of these
groups differ from that of lau et al. who failed to show
significant differences in staining for vegf in either glandular
or stromal staining (lau et al., 1999). this difference may
reflect the specificity of the different antibodies used by the
groups and this group’s findings do not concur with earlier insitu hybridization studies (charnock-jones et al., 1993). a
study with small numbers of cynomolgus monkeys during the
normal cycle also showed a significant increase in glandular
vegf staining during the secretory phase compared with the
proliferative phase (greb et al., 1995). it is also of interest
that in the present study a simple comparison within the

before-treatment (normal cycle) group from the mircette study
of glandular vegf staining during the proliferative phase
(n ⫽ 8) versus the secretory phase (n ⫽ 11) showed no
significant difference.
the present study showed that glandular pr staining was
significantly reduced during the mid- and late secretory phases
of the cycle compared to the proliferative phase. these results
agree with those of others (e.g. snijders et al., 1992; critchley
et al., 1993) and is consistent with down-regulation by progesterone (chauchereau et al., 1991; snijders et al., 1992). the
continued presence of pr in the stroma through the cycle also
agrees with previous work (critchley et al., 1993). the lack
of statistically significantly reduced glandular or stromal er
staining as the cycle progressed in the current study is probably
due to insufficient subject numbers. trends towards reduced
er staining in the secretory phase were, however, apparent.
the correlation between vegf immunoreactivity in the
glands and stroma suggests a similarity in regulation, although
the variation in the glands is more pronounced. the relationship
between glandular er and glandular pr is reflected by similar
regulation of each receptor by oestrogen and progesterone, i.e.
oestrogen alone up-regulates er and pr, whereas progesterone
down-regulates er and pr (mcdonnell et al., 1995). the
negative correlation between glandular vegf and glandular
pr is of interest, since this is consistent with the hypothesis

that endometrial glandular vegf is regulated by progesterone
in vivo in the normal human adult. the finding that progesterone
increases expression of the most abundant forms of vegf in
the uterus of immature rats is also consistent with this
hypothesis (cullinan-bove and koos, 1993). the antibody
used in this study does not distinguish between the different
spliced forms of vegf and it is suggested that the smaller
121 form of vegf is the main variant expressed by stromal
cells (huang et al., 1998). however, 165 is the main variant
of glandular expression and like the 121 variant is regulated
by ovarian steroids.
the correlation between stromal vegf staining and endothelial cell number has not been previously reported. more
work, with larger subject numbers, is required to investigate
this interesting relationship further. as an angiogenic factor,
it seems probable that vegf could influence endometrial
vascular density. in tumours, microvessel density has been
used as a measure of tumour angiogenesis, with increased
intratumoral microvessel density correlating with increased
metastasis and/or decreased patient survival (vartanian and
weidner, 1994). however, in the present and previous studies,
neither endometrial endothelial cell number nor microvascular
density (rogers et al., 1993; goodger macpherson and rogers,
1994) changed throughout the normal cycle and indeed changes
in endothelial cell number do not necessarily indicate changes
3085

a.m.macpherson et al.

in angiogenic activity (goodger macpherson and rogers,
1995). the lack of change in intensity of stromal vegf
staining and endothelial cell number during the cycle suggest
that these parameters may be regulated by non-steroidal
mechanisms. however, this is at odds with the suggestion
that glandular and stromal vegf are regulated by similar
mechanisms and that glandular vegf is regulated by progesterone.
the contraceptives implanon and mircette, which contain
the pro-form of the same progestagen in combination with
ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx , both significantly reduced endometrial
glandular immunoreactive vegf. after 12 months of use there
was no difference in endothelial cell number compared to
before-treatment, and there was no correlation between glandular vegf staining and endothelial cell number for the aftertreatment biopsies from either the implanon or mircette studies.
in the light of the observation that stromal vegf correlates
with endothelial cell number during the normal cycle, however,
the reduction in glandular vegf with contraceptive treatment
may be biologically unimportant. indeed there was a similar
positive correlation between stromal vegf and endothelial
cell number with implanon treatment, but not mircette treatment. the significantly increased glandular pr staining with
implanon use shows that  xxxd2067xxx  alone fails to downregulate the  xxxg1737xxx  in the same way that
progesterone does. it is likely that the balance of agonist/
antagonist actions and the  xxxg1737xxx  type contributes to the end result of progestin action. on the other hand,
mircette resulted in significantly reduced stromal pr compared
with normal secretory phase values in response to progesterone.
for both contraceptives, however, neither bleeding patterns
during the 90 day reference period just prior to the aftertreatment biopsy, nor histological category of the after-treatment biopsy showed any significant differences with vegf,
er or pr staining, or endothelial cell number.
the lack of change in endothelial cell number with the two
contraceptives used in this study contrasts with the action of
three other contraceptives, for example, norplant (an implant
which releases 80 µg/day levonorgestrel); high doses of  xxxd2751xxx  and medroxypogesterone acetate (mpa). norplant
results in significantly increased microvascular and endothelial
cell number compared with that seen during the normal cycle
(despite significantly reduced endothelial cell proliferation),
probably due either to increased regression of tissue surrounding the endometrial vessels, or a reduced rate of endothelial cell death (rogers et al., 1993; goodger macpherson
et al., 1994; hickey et al., 1999). the increased vascular
density did not seem to be directly related to increased
endometrial bleeding. on the other hand, treatment with higher
doses of  xxxd2751xxx  or mpa resulted in a significantly
decreased endometrial vascular density (song et al., 1995).
none of these studies, however, investigated vegf immunoreactivity. another study investigating endometrial microvascular density in various conditions of atrophy found no
differences compared with the endometrium removed
from normally cycling women (hickey et al., 1996).
the present study confirms the apparent dissociation between endometrial endothelial cell number and endo3086

metrial bleeding. it has also been proposed that there may
be considerable endometrial microvascular heterogeneity,
particularly in response to norplant treatment resulting
in focal bleeding sites (rogers, 1996). the same may be
true with other steroid treatments.
in conclusion, the present study shows that immunoreactive
vegf increases significantly in the glands of the endometrium
during the normal menstrual cycle, while immunoreactive pr
decreases. this study also shows that implanon and mircette
significantly reduce glandular vegf staining. this is not
associated with changes in endothelial cell number, bleeding
pattern, or histological category of the endometrium. stromal
staining for vegf correlated positively with endothelial cell
number although neither parameter changed significantly
throughout the menstrual cycle, or influenced the endometrial
bleeding pattern.
