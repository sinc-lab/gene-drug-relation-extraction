abstract
hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder encountered in hospitalized patients. it is a state of
relative water excess due to stimulated  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) and fluid intake greater than obligatory
losses. this kind of hyponatremia occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate  xxxd3495xxx  secretion,
congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. fluid restriction is the presently recommended treatment for
hyponatremia. however, fluid restriction may be very difficult for patients to achieve, is slow to work, and
does not allow a graded therapeutic approach. more efficient and specific treatments of hyponatremia are
needed. in this respect, pharmacologic research has yielded a number of compounds exhibiting antagonistic
qualities at the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx . among these agents, peptidic derivatives of avp turned out to
have intrinsic antidiuretic properties in vivo when given over days or weeks. the development of such
agents for use in patients has not been pursued. however, several promising nonpeptide, vasopressin
receptor antagonists have been described; these agents are vpa-985 (lixivaptan), ym-087 ( xxxd1747xxx ),
 xxxd3399xxx  ( xxxd3399xxx ), and sr-121463. prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials performed
with these agents found that they corrected hyponatremia efficiently and safely. most of the studies were
conducted over a 4- to 28-day period. long-term studies will be needed in the future to address such issues
as the eventual benefit to patients and the effects of vasopressin antagonists on morbidity and mortality of
patients with hyponatremia. © 2006 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.

hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder occurring in hospital inpatients,1 and it is not rare in outpatients.2 hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration ⱕ136 mmol/l [1 mmol/l ⫽ 1 meq/l]. the clinical
relevance of an electrolyte disorder is related to the symptoms and changes it causes. adverse events known to occur
in the setting of hyponatremia include lethargy, muscle
cramps, anorexia, disorientation, seizures, and coma. the
severity of these changes depends on the severity of the
hyponatremia and on the rate of decline of the serum sodium concentration. a patient with acute hyponatremia
(ⱕ36 to 48 hours’ duration) that is severe (serum sodium
concentration ⱕ115 to 118 mmol/l) is likely to exhibit

prominent symptoms, whereas a patient with chronic mild
hyponatremia may appear to be asymptomatic. however, in
a recent study, detailed psychomotor testing revealed that
seemingly asymptomatic patients with chronic mild hyponatremia do have abnormalities and that the abnormalities
were improved after the hyponatremia disappeared.3 thus,
treatment of hyponatremia is of great interest to physicians.
recent developments in vasopressin antagonists present a
new issue for clinical consideration. the potential role of
these agents is best described in the context of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia. we will outline only those
aspects of hyponatremia that pertain to the role vasopressin
antagonists may play in its treatment.

generally speaking, hyponatremia does not imply the presence of a sodium deficit of the organism. rather, a large

s88
body of published evidence indicates that it is best explained on the basis of vasopressin-induced water retention
and subsequent dilution of osmolality and serum sodium.4,5
for instance, chronic infusion of vasopressin alone in normal rats decreases their fluid intake and leaves the serum
sodium concentration unaltered; however, chronic infusion
of vasopressin together with hypotonic fluid leads to a stable
degree of hyponatremia within 3 days, and the associated
sodium balance is neither negative nor positive.6 measurements of plasma vasopressin concentration have been obtained in several clinical states of hyponatremia, including
liver cirrhosis, congestive heart failure (chf), hypothyroidism, and syndrome of inappropriate  xxxd3495xxx 
secretion (siadh).7,8 in these studies, measurable vasopressin was detectable in the vast majority of patients. when
fluid intake of patients with hyponatremia was measured, it
was found to be increased, too.7 the failure of hypo-osmolality to fully suppress  xxxd3495xxx  and thirst
(drinking) is therefore considered to be the primary cause of
hyponatremia. the stimuli of such “nonosmotic” vasopressin have been analyzed,4,5 and were found to be attributable
to low cardiac output and arterial baroreceptor signals in
hyponatremic heart failure, but they have remained unknown in paraneoplastic vasopressin secretion of siadh.
taken together, the evidence suggests that treatment for
hyponatremia should be directed toward minimizing the
effects of nonosmotic vasopressin, for example, by administering vasopressin antagonists and decreasing fluid intake.

lack of specific and efficient treatment
of hyponatremia
the standard recommendation of therapy for hyponatremia
at the present time is restricting intake of all fluids—including fluids in food—to ⬍1 l/day. however, it is often very
difficult for patients to comply with fluid restriction. in
addition, such a measure is slow to work and difficult to
fine-tune. hence, fluid restriction is not very efficient and it
often is not popular with patients or medical staff.
soupart and colleagues9 have advocated the use of urea
for the treatment of chronic hyponatremia in siadh. urea
induces an osmotic diuresis and thereby promotes freewater excretion. although this treatment is obviously effective, it has never gained widespread acceptance.
several years ago, hantman and coworkers10 suggested
treating hyponatremia in siadh with a loop diuretic, followed by measuring the sodium excreted and replacing it
quantitatively in the form of hypertonic saline. loop diuretics are very effective in the treatment of siadh because
they induce a copious, salt-poor diuresis. however, the
treatment is cumbersome and it is sometimes difficult to
avoid miscalculations. hence, this procedure is not applied
in all patients with hyponatremias in whom it would be
indicated. lithium carbonate and demeclocycline have side
effects that induce  xxxg231xxx  and have
been used to treat hyponatremia; however, the toxicity of
these agents and their unpredictable therapeutic effects have

the american journal of medicine, vol 119 (7a), july 2006
made them obsolete. given the present lack of efficient and
specific treatments for hyponatremia, it is not surprising that
attention has turned to vasopressin antagonists.

peptidic antagonists to the vasopressin
 xxxg231xxx 
the first avenue of research to antagonize the renal hydroosmotic  xxxg231xxx  ( xxxg231xxx ) led to analogues of the arginine
vasopressin (avp) molecule that showed competitive binding to the receptor without activating it. several such peptidic agents have been synthesized and found to be effective
in vitro.11 however, chronic experiments in vivo in normal
rats receiving a peptidic antagonist of this kind over 14 days
demonstrated an attenuation of antagonistic effect after 5
days.12 the investigators considered that agonistic activity
might have been involved. this was confirmed later in
experiments by administering continuous infusions of the
antagonist to (vasopressin-deficient) brattleboro rats. in
these studies an antidiuretic effect of the antagonist was
observed that resembled the effects of exogenous vasopressin. it was concluded that intrinsic antidiuretic activity precluded the “antagonist” from inducing a persistent water
diuresis.13 in another set of experiments, investigators characterized the peptidic antagonist desglyd(ch2)5dtyr(et)vavp in vitro and in vivo. this agent appeared to
be the most potent antagonist of vasopressin-stimulated
adenylate cyclase in rat, dog, and squirrel monkey studies.
however, when the antagonist was given to human volunteers with hydropenia, no significant decrease in urinary
osmolality was detectable. administration of the antagonist
to healthy volunteers in water diuresis—supposedly associated with a low intrinsic vasopressin level—yielded a dosedependent antidiuresis.14 this study concluded that the
agent was an antidiuretic agonist in human volunteers.
taken together, these findings indicate that peptidic antagonists of the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx —although useful for in vitro
studies as well as in specific short-term in vivo experiments—are not adequate for the long-term treatment of
water-retaining disorders in humans because of their intrinsic agonistic properties and the requirement for parenteral
administration.

opc-31260
another avenue of research sought to delineate orally available vasopressin v2 antagonists. a breakthrough of this
kind occurred in 1992 with the description of opc-31260,
a nonpeptidic, orally available benzazepine derivative and
specific v2 antagonist.15 pharmacologic in vitro binding
studies of opc-31260 selectively blocked the  xxxg231xxx  in a
competitive manner, and its 50% inhibitory concentration
(ic50) was estimated to be 1.4 ⫻ 10– 8 mol/l. in conscious
rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys, opc-31260 caused
an increase in urine volume and a decrease in urinary
osmolality in a dose-dependent manner when 3 to 30 mg/kg
was administered orally.15 the agent was free of intrinsic

antidiuretic effects when tested in water-diuresing rats exhibiting low endogenous vasopressin levels.15
opc-31260 was given orally to healthy male volunteers
in doses ranging from 3 to 200 mg. the highest dose of the
antagonist increased the urinary flow rate 4-fold over the
first 6 hours after dosing when compared with placebo
control. during this time urinary osmolality decreased from
⬃600 mosm/kg to ⬍100 mosm/kg (1 mosm/kg h2o ⫽ 1
mmol/kg h2o). the free-water clearance, which had been
negative before the first dose of opc-31260, increased and
reached approximately 3 ⫾ 0.3 ml/min at the time of
maximal effect. the serum sodium concentration increased
by 4 to 6 mmol/l over the 6-hour observation period, and
there was a proportionate increase in serum osmolality. the
endogenous plasma vasopressin level tripled. however, the
urinary excretion rates of sodium, potassium, and chloride
remained unchanged.15 hence opc-31260 was considered
to be an aquaretic agent.
in another set of experiments the potential role of opc31260 in pathologic states of water retention was tested.16
experimental siadh was generated in sprague-dawley
rats by parenteral delivery of exogenous vasopressin over
14 days. orally supplied opc-31260 in a dose of 5 mg/kg
increased the urinary flow rate, lowered the urinary osmolality, and returned the serum sodium concentration, which
had been as low as 115 mmol/l, to a level of 134 mmol/l
within 3 days of treatment. in response to opc-31260,
aquaporin-2 messenger rna in the kidney was significantly
attenuated,16 which was interpreted as further evidence for
effective blockade of the  xxxg231xxx ; a comparable set of findings
using opc-31260 was also obtained in rats with experimental liver cirrhosis and ascites.16 when the outcomes were
assessed together, opc-31260 proved the principle: the
results indicated that oral vasopressin antagonists function
as specific and effective agents. to date, opc-31260 has
not been used outside of japan.

lixivaptan
a few years after the opc-31260 reports, another relevant
benzazepine was described17; it was given the designation
of vpa-985 (lixivaptan). this agent was found to have
specific and competitive binding to the  xxxg231xxx , and in vivo
studies in laboratory animals treated with lixivaptan demonstrated potent aquaretic activity in normal rats, brattleboro rats, and dogs.17 when administered to rats in combination with furosemide, lixivaptan did not decrease the
natriuretic effects of furosemide and furosemide did not
diminish the aquaretic action of lixivaptan.
a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
lixivaptan in hyponatremia was reported.18 the trial included patients with hyponatremia and chf, liver cirrhosis,
and siadh. patients with hyponatremia in the setting of
volume depletion (e.g., after diarrhea) were excluded from
participation. lixivaptan was given orally twice a day, and
patients were asked to adhere to fluid restriction of 1 l/day.
treatment was tested over 6 days, and 112 patients were

included. lixivaptan was found to cause diuresis; mean
24-hour urinary volume increased from 1.0 ⫾ 0.2 l/day to
3.05 ⫾ 0.4 l/day on the first day of treatment. this diuresis
was hypotonic (before lixivaptan urinary osmolality was
410 ⫾ 67 mosm/kg h2o; on the first day after lixivaptan
urinary osmolality was 185 ⫾ 26 mosm/kg h2o) (figure
1). accordingly, the free-water clearance became positive
(before lixivaptan administration, h2o clearance was – 0.45
⫾ 0.18 ml/min; 24 hours after lixivaptan administration,
h2o clearance was 1.3 ⫾ 0.25 ml/min) (figure 2). hyponatremia was corrected in patients treated with lixivaptan
but not in patients given placebo (figure 3). severity of
thirst did not change, although it appeared to tend toward an
increase. surprisingly, weight decreased by only a small
amount. patients with siadh responded more quickly and
clearly to lixivaptan in terms of hyponatremia correction
(figure 4) compared with patients who had hyponatremia
with cardiac failure and cirrhosis. occasionally, patients
failed to respond altogether for unknown reasons.
side effects, such as nausea and postural changes, occurred with comparable frequency in patients treated with
lixivaptan and in placebo controls. however, a mild but
significant decrease in creatinine clearance was seen in the
high-dose lixivaptan-treated group (200 mg/day). it was
also noted that the endogenous plasma vasopressin concentration increased from 2.05 ⫾ 0.2 pg/ml to 5.7 ⫾ 0.3
pg/ml (p ⬍0.05) in treated patients [1 pg/ml ⫽ 1 ng/l];
however, there were no reported instances of angina pectoris, spastic episodes, bleeding or thrombotic events related
to the use of lixivaptan. investigators were under the impression that after correction of hyponatremia, patients be-

this agent displaces a selective vasopressin  xxxg229xxx  antagonist
in a dose-dependent manner from rat liver membranes; the
ic50 was 2.2 ⫾ 0.1 nmol/l. the agent also caused a concentration-dependent displacement of a vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
antagonist from renal medullary membranes, and the ic50 of
the binding affinity was 0.4 ⫾ 0.1 nmol/l. in the in vivo
experiments involving orally administered  xxxd1747xxx ,
binding to v1ars in rat liver membranes was maintained for
16 to 24 hours in a dose-dependent manner. comparable
observations were made in renal membranes containing
v2rs. oral  xxxd1747xxx  at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/kg per day
given for 7 days in normotensive rats caused a dose-dependent aquaresis with no effect on specific blood pressure.20
 xxxd1747xxx  was given to healthy volunteers,21 and, upon
oral administration of a single 60-mg dose, peak effects
were observed after 2 hours. at that time a significant 7-fold
increase in the urinary flow rate and a decrease in urinary
osmolality from 600 mosm/kg to ⬍100 mosm/kg were
observed. the plasma osmolality increased simultaneously
from 283 ⫾ 1.3 mosm/kg to 289 ⫾ 1.7 mosm/kg. the
endogenous vasopressin level was 0.9 ⫾ 0.1 pg/ml at
baseline and 3.9 ⫾ 0.7 pg/ml after administration of
 xxxd1747xxx . this agent also inhibited vasopressin-induced
skin vasoconstriction, suggesting an effective blockade of
v1ars.
 xxxd1747xxx  has been studied in several double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of hyponatremia.22 the studies were conducted in
patients with a serum sodium concentration of 115 mmol/l
to less than 130 mmol/l due to a variety of causes including

palm et al

vasopressin antagonists as aquaretic agents for hyponatremia

chf and siadh. although  xxxd1747xxx  was originally discovered as an orally active v1a/v2 antagonist, it was developed for intravenous application. in 1 study it was given
intravenously by continuous infusion over 4 days at doses of
40 mg/day and 80 mg/day following a loading dose of 20
mg intravenously on the first day. during the study patients
adhered to fluid restriction of 2 l/day.22 in the group of
patients receiving high-dose  xxxd1747xxx  (80 mg/day), the
treatment increased the serum sodium concentration significantly from a baseline of 125 mmol/l to 134 mmol/l. in
the group of patients receiving the 40 mg dose, the serum
sodium concentration was significantly increased from a
baseline of 123 mmol/l to 130 mmol/l. the treatment with
 xxxd1747xxx  resulted in a significantly increased effective
water clearance (ewc) on day 1. the mean increase in
ewc on day 1 was 1984 ml with  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/day
and 1759 ml with  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/day. taken together
 xxxd1747xxx  appeared to be an efficient therapy of hyponatremia and it was a safe agent.

sr-121463
the sr-121463 compound is a nonpeptide, orally active,
specific vasopressin v2 antagonist with a prolonged halflife.23 in pharmacologic studies, sr-121463 exhibited competitive binding to v2rs of rat, dog, and human tissue in
nanomolar concentrations, similar to the binding of avp.
potential aquaretic properties of sr-121463a were studied in vivo in rats with doses ranging between 0.1 and 1.0
mg/kg. maximal increase in urinary flow rate occurred 2
hours after dosing; at that time the flow rate increased 2- to
5-fold depending on the drug dose. urinary osmolality decreased from 1380 ⫾ 42 mosm/kg to 310 ⫾ 20 mosm/kg
in the high-dose group during treatment. in the high-dose
group, the duration of the aquaretic effect was 12 hours. at
doses ⬍0.3 mg/kg of sr-121463a, no significant increases
in kaliuresis or natriuresis were observed. when
sr-121463a was administered to brattleboro rats over 8
days, no antidiuresis was seen; this observation was taken to
exclude agonistic properties of the antagonist.23
in a phase 3 clinical protocol, 34 patients with hyponatremia and siadh received sr-121463b orally over 5 to
23 days. the dose was 25 or 50 mg once daily, and patients
adhered to fluid restriction of 1.5 l/day. sr-121463b increased the urinary volume from 1.5 l/day to 2.5 l/day in
the high-dose group, and this degree of aquaresis was maintained over the first 5 days of the study. urinary osmolality
decreased by approximately 50%. sr-121463b successfully corrected the hyponatremia; mean serum sodium concentration increased from 127 ⫾ 5 mmol/l at baseline in the
control group to 140 ⫾ 6 mmol/l on day 5 of treatment in
the high-dose group. there was no loss of weight despite the
aquaresis. the urinary sodium excretion rate was lower in
the group receiving sr-121463b than in the control group.
in an open-label extension study over 1 year it was found
that sr-121463b continued to be fully effective; there was
no tachyphylaxis.24 the investigators concluded that sr-

s91

121463b appeared to be a safe and effective agent for
treatment of hyponatremia.

 xxxd3399xxx 
in 1998 yamamura and colleagues25 described  xxxd3399xxx 
( xxxd3399xxx ), an orally active specific v2 antagonist that is a
benzazepine derivative. in vitro experiments demonstrated
higher binding affinity to v2rs by  xxxd3399xxx  than by avp.25
the physiologic response to  xxxd3399xxx  was studied in normal water-diuresing rats. the agent was given orally in
doses of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, and maximal effects were seen at
2 hours after dosing. at this time urinary flow rate increased
by ⬎10-fold and the urinary osmolality decreased by
⬎50%.25 extended experiments in rats involving daily dosing of  xxxd3399xxx  were carried out over 4 weeks; these studies
failed to show any tachyphylaxis of the aquaretic effects.25
studies also tested the possibility of an interference between
the effects of a loop diuretic and those of  xxxd3399xxx .26 no
significant interference was found; the addition of  xxxd3399xxx 
to pretreatment by furosemide increased free-water clearance further without any decrease of sodium diuresis.26
 xxxd3399xxx  is also under investigation in the clinical treatment of hyponatremia.27 two multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted and are in the
process of evaluation. the target population was patients
with hyponatremia and cardiac failure, liver cirrhosis, or
siadh.27  xxxd3399xxx  was given orally once a day in doses
between 15 mg and 60 mg depending on the response of the
serum sodium concentration. patients participating for the
first time were not placed on fluid restriction. with the
exception of the first 24 hours, all treatments were given and
supervised on an outpatient basis. a preliminary evaluation
of the data that was presented recently27 concluded that
 xxxd3399xxx  corrected hyponatremia. the outpatient treatment
and the extended duration of the protocol did not seem to
lead to an overly rapid correction rate of the hyponatremia
or even to hypernatremia. the reports concluded that
 xxxd3399xxx  was a promising agent for the treatment of hyponatremia.

summary
different approaches have been used to develop vasopressin
receptor antagonists. initially peptidic molecules were derived by derivatization of the avp molecule. although
these agents have proved useful for in vitro studies and
short-term in vivo experiments, further use in the clinical
setting has been limited. the limitations were caused by
intrinsic agonistic (antidiuretic) effects of the agents and by
their parenteral mode of application. more recent drug development has yielded nonpeptide, vasopressin antagonists
that appear to be without agonistic effects. these agents are
lixivaptan,  xxxd1747xxx , sr-121463, and  xxxd3399xxx . all of
these are specific v2 antagonists, except for  xxxd1747xxx ,
which is a v1a/v2 mixed antagonist and was developed for
parenteral application.  xxxd3399xxx  has a prolonged half-life,
and a single daily dose is sufficient. several small studies

s92
lasting 4 to 28 days have demonstrated that these agents are
efficient and specific for the treatment of hyponatremia. a
number of issues will have to be clarified in the future. it is
unclear whether v1a/v2 antagonism is superior to v2 antagonism in settings such as hyponatremic cardiac failure. it
also is not sufficiently known what the clinical benefit to the
patient with hyponatremia shall be. there are no long-term
studies yet addressing outcome in terms of morbidity and
mortality of hyponatremic patients treated with vasopressin
antagonists. further studies are needed to resolve these and
other issues.
