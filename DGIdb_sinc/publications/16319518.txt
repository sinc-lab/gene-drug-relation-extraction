abstract
brazilein (6a,7-dihydro-3,6a,10-trihydroxy-benz[b]indeno[1,2-d]pyran-9(6h)-one) is a compound obtained in a
large amount from caesalpinia sappan ethanol extracts
with a high purity of about 98%. in isolated cardiac tissues, we found that brazilein exhibited a positive inotropic action in a concentration-dependent manner with
little effect on heart rate and coronary perfusion. to
study its possible mode of action, isolated rat hearts
were treated with propranolol. this treatment did not
alter the cardiotonic effect of brazilein, suggesting that
this effect does not involve stimulation of -adrenoceptors. on the other hand, an analysis of the interaction
between na+,k+-atpase and brazilein was carried out.
albino guinea pig erythrocytes (mainly 1-na+,k+atpase isoforms) enriched with na+,k+-atpase isoforms
were utilized to compare the inhibition promoted by brazilein with that of classical inhibitors such as the cardiac
glycoside  xxxd1845xxx . analysis of inhibition curves revealed that unlike  xxxd1845xxx , brazilein had a relatively
low affinity for erythrocyte isoforms and failed to completely inhibit the na+,k+-atpase activity. the extent of
the maximum inhibition rate was about 50%. the inhibitory effect of brazilein was not antagonized by 10 mmol/l k+,
as observed with  xxxd1845xxx . electrocardiogram research in vivo showed that brazilein did not induce the

ventricular arrhythmias observed with  xxxd1845xxx , suggesting that brazilein might have a less adverse effect
and higher therapeutic index than cardiac glycosides. in
light of all the above-mentioned observations, it can be
concluded that brazilein, a molecule with a non-steroidal
skeleton, produced its positive inotropic effect through
inhibiting na+,k+-atpase and could thus serve as a structural paradigm to develop new inotropic drugs.

introduction

brazilein (6a,7-dihydro-3,6a,10-trihydroxy-benz[b]indeno[1,2-d]pyran-9(6h)-one) is a major component of
caesalpinia sappan l. organic extracts [1, 2]. c. sappan
is an indeciduous tree native to china and south india.
its heartwood has long been used in traditional chinese
medicine (tcm) not only to treat various infectious diseases such as abscess, carbuncles, and tetanus, but also as
emmenagogue, analgesic, and anti-inﬂammatory treatments [3–5]. the extract of c. sappan has been reported
to have some pharmacological activities such as an anticomplementary effect on the complement system [6], an
anti-motility effect on human sperm [7], and anti-hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) capability [8].
recently, it has become a trend to search crude natural
plants for effective ingredients (particularly for some
herbal medicines long and widely used clinically). many
achievements have been made through this approach,
such as taxol [9] (an anticancer drug from taxus breviﬂo-

the residue (200 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column,
and eluted with chcl3-meoh (9:1). the elution was again separated by sephadex lh-20 (meoh) to give the compound brazilein
(18 g; ﬁg. 1). the purity of brazilein was conﬁrmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) [12] and compared with the
authentic sample obtained from national institute for the control
of pharmaceutical and biological products, beijing, china. the
results showed that the purity of brazilein used in this experiment
was 98.4%.

lia), tetramethylpyrazine [10] (an anti-platelet drug from
ligustium wolli chii fran chat), and artemisinin [11] (an
anti-malarial from artemisia apiacea hance ex walpers).
in our laboratory brazilein, with a high purity of about
98%, was obtained in a large amount from c. sappan
ethanol extracts. literature searches showed that few papers have reported the bioactivities of brazilein. accordingly, an anti-complementary activity on the complement
system has been reported [6], no other bioactivities were
now found. these are the reasons for further investigation
into the bioactivities of brazilein.
in an experiment on isolated hearts, brazilein was
found to occasionally increase the contractility of hearts.
although the ﬁnding might not be correlated with the
other reports mentioned above, it still attracted our interest because it is possible for us to ﬁnd a target through the
isolated heart experiment. this target will help to ﬁnd
other activities of brazilein.
consequently, the aim of this paper is to investigate
the characteristics and mechanisms of brazilein cardiotonic effects.

materials and methods
plant material
the heartwood of c. sappan was purchased from songlan inc.,
beijing, pr china. plant material was identiﬁed and authenticated
by dr. l.z. xu (institute of medicinal plant, china academy of
medical sciences and peking union medical college, beijing
100094, china). the herbarium specimen (sic-cs 01) has been
stored with us.

experimental protocol and experimental design
noradrenaline, propranolol hydrochloride and  xxxd1845xxx 
(sigma) were used in this series of experiments. after all hearts had
been equilibrated for 20 min, brazilein and the above drugs (200 l)
were administered retrogradely through a polyethylene cannula.
six groups in this series of experiments were designed to characterize brazilein-induced cardiotonic effect: group 1, brazilein
10 mmol/l in krebs-henseleit solution containing 0.5% dmso;
group 2, brazilein 2 mmol/l in krebs-henseleit solution containing
0.5% dmso; group 3, brazilein 0.4 mmol/l in krebs-henseleit solution containing 0.5% dmso; group 4, noradrenaline 30 mol/l
in krebs-henseleit solution containing 0.5% dmso; group 5,  xxxd1845xxx  0. 4 mmol/l in krebs-henseleit solution containing 0.5%
dmso, and group 6, control, krebs-henseleit solution containing
0.5% dmso.
propranolol hydrochloride was used to determine the relationship between the brazilein cardiotonic effect and -adrenergic receptor.

isolation and puriﬁcation of brazilein
the heartwood of c. sappan (1 kg) was reﬂuxed for 1 h in aqueous ethanol (95% v/v, 600 ml) three times and the combined alcoholic extract was concentrated to residue under reduced pressure.

measurement of na+,k+-atpase in erythrocyte membranes
from albino guinea pigs
the method described by eder et al. [14] was applied to prepare
erythrocyte membranes. membranes were suspended in 0.1 mol/l
tris-hcl (ph 7.4) to a ﬁnal concentration of about 2 mg protein/ml.

isolated heart preparations
isolated hearts were prepared from female albino guinea pigs
(laboratory animal institute, chinese academy of medical sciences, beijing, china) of body mass between 300 and 400 g. animals were fed and given water ad libitum. animals were treated
according to the guidelines on accommodation and care of animals
formulated by the chinese convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientiﬁc purposes.
the animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and heparin (200 u) was administered through the femoral vein to avoid clotting of blood. then
the hearts were rapidly excised, freed of adhering tissue and mounted intact on the langendorff heart apparatus and perfused retrogradely with krebs-henseleit solution [13]. the krebs-henseleit
solution consisted of the following (mmol/l): nacl, 118.0; kcl, 4.7;
mgcl2  6h2o, 0.5; nahco3, 25.0; nah2po4, 1.0; glucose, 10.0,
and cacl2  2h2o, 2.2. the solution was kept at a constant temperature of 37 ° c and constant pressure of 70 cm h2o and was aerated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 gas mixture prior to and during the
experiment. contractility was measured with a force-displacement
transducer (xin hang corp., beijing, china) that was coupled with
an 8-channel recorder (graphtec corp., tokyo, japan) and attached perpendicular to the heart by a small hook. the heart rate
was counted from the contraction curves. coronary efﬂuent was
measured by a drop counter constructed by our laboratory.

electrocardiographic recording and analysis
guinea pigs (300–400 g) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), placed in a supine position and prepared for electrocardiogram (ecg). the ecg
was recorded using the standard bipolar leads. the electrodes were
held on the limbs (extremities). lead (right foreleg and left hindleg)
was monitored on an ecg-6511 electrocardiograph (kohden
corp., shanghai, china) at a voltage setting of 1 mv/cm and at a
paper speed of 25 mm/s. the following ecg parameters were ana-

the protein content was determined as described by lowry et al.
[15].
na+,k+-atpase activity was calculated as the difference between total atpase activity (na+,k+,mg2+-dependent) and  xxxd2531xxx dependent atpase activity [16]. total atpase activity was assayed
at 37 ° c in an incubation medium consisting of: 50 mmol/l trishcl (ph 7.4); 80 mmol/l nacl; 3 mmol/l kcl; 4 mmol/l mgcl2;
1 mmol/l edta k2-salt (k+-edta); 3 mmol/l disodium atp, and
80–100 g protein of the membranes in a ﬁnal volume of 1 ml.
ouabain (1 mmol/l) was added to determine the activity of the
mg2+-atpase. the values of mg2+-dependent atpase were similar
in the presence of ouabain in the reaction mixture, as also in the
absence of ouabain and without nacl and kcl (in the presence of
mgcl2 only). the reaction was started by adding atp and stopped
after a 30-min incubation period by the addition of 1 ml of 15%
trichloroacetic acid. adp produced from the reaction was measured by the modiﬁed method of hplc [17]. the hplc apparatus
was a waters system (waters corp., milford, mass., usa) consisting of a model 515 liquid pump, and a model 996 spectrophotometric detector. a supelcosil lc-18 column was used with a
column oven heated to 25 ° c. the mobile phase consisted of
0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer (containing 1 mmol/l tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution)-acetonitrile (97.5:2.5, v/v; ph ; 6.0).
the ﬂow rate was 1 ml/min and the detector was set at 254 nm. the
results are expressed as micromoles of adp per milligram of membrane protein per hour.

lyzed from lead ii: heart rate; pr interval; qrs duration; qt interval, and amplitudes of t waves, all of which were measured as
the average of three consecutive cycles. measurements were made
by a person well trained in identifying p waves, qrs complexes
and t waves, but who did not know whether drugs had an effect on
ecg. at a rate of 0.4 ml/kg/min, brazilein and  xxxd1845xxx  were
continuously administered through the jugular vein at a dose of
2 mg/kg/min and 80 g/kg/min, respectively. brazilein and  xxxd1845xxx  were solubilized in ﬁltered normal saline containing 0.02%
poloxamer (sigma; ph adjusted to 7.4 with naoh) to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mg/ml and 400 g/ml, respectively.
statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean 8 sem for the indicated number
of experiments. analysis of variance (anova) with dunnett test
was used to analyze the data and the criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was p ! 0.05.

results

cardiotonic effect of brazilein
as shown in ﬁgure 2, brazilein increased the contractility of isolated hearts signiﬁcantly in a concentrationdependent manner after a single injection of 200 l of the
drug solution. this effect peaked at about 30 s with increases of 22.4, 19.5 and 5.1% at doses of 2, 0.4 and
0.08 mol, respectively, and lasted for at least 60 s. compared with noradrenaline, brazilein exhibited a longer
cardiotonic effect just like that of  xxxd1845xxx  (ﬁg. 3). at
the same dose of 0.08 mol/heart,  xxxd1845xxx  increased
the contractility by 20.0% which was about 4 times greater than the effect of brazilein.

inhibitory action of brazilein on na+,k+-atpase
activity in vitro
as shown in ﬁgure 7, the  xxxd2799xxx   xxxd1845xxx 
exhibited a high potency to inhibit the na+,k+-atpase
in the erythrocyte membrane preparation (ic50 41.3 8
3.1 mol/l). erythrocyte na+,k+-atpase was almost
abolished by  xxxd1845xxx  at 1 mmol/l. in contrast, brazilein inhibited the erythrocyte na+,k+-atpase with potency lower than  xxxd1845xxx  (ic50 500 8 13 mol/l).
interestingly, brazilein failed to completely inhibit the
erythrocyte na+,k+-atpase. at the highest concentration of 1 mmol/l, brazilein was able to decrease the erythrocyte na+,k+-atpase by only 52%.

as shown in ﬁgure 5, propranolol hydrochloride did
not affect the cardiotonic effect of brazilein, which indicated that the brazilein-induced cardiotonic effect is not
due to activation of -adrenergic receptors.
figure 6 shows the effect of brazilein on coronary perfusion. while noradrenaline signiﬁcantly decreased the
coronary perfusion rate, brazilein and  xxxd1845xxx  had
little effect on the coronary perfusion rate.

effect of potassium
the effect of k+ is a classical mechanism to decrease
the biochemical and clinical action of cardiac glycosides
[18]. as shown in ﬁgure 8a, increasing the k+ concentration from 3 to 20 mmol/l progressively antagonized the
ouabain-induced effect, as shown by a shift of the ouabain-induced inhibition curves to the right. on the contrary, increasing the k+ concentration did not affect the
inhibition induced by brazilein, as shown by the overlap
of the inhibition curves (ﬁg. 8b).

effect of brazilein on ecg of guinea pigs in vivo
as shown in table 1, at therapeutic doses (about 400–
560 g/kg ) the  xxxd2799xxx   xxxd1845xxx  was able to
decrease the heart rate and qt interval, prolong the pr
interval and qrs duration, and depress the amplitudes
of t waves. with the increase in dose,  xxxd1845xxx  caused
the p waves to disappear and induced ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular ﬁbrillation and death,
which corresponds to previous reports [19–21].

table 2 shows the effect of brazilein on the ecg of
guinea pigs. at a dose of about 4 mg/kg, brazilein began
to have the same impact on ecg as  xxxd1845xxx . however, brazilein did not induce the same ventricular arrhythmias as  xxxd1845xxx . at a dose of about 48 mg/kg,
brazilein caused guinea pigs to die of dyspnea, which was
concurrent with high amplitudes of inverting t waves.

discussion

although noradrenaline is a potent nonselective -adrenoreceptor agonist, it is a full 1-adrenoreceptor agonist
with maximum efﬁcacy. consequently, noradrenaline
can produce a positive inotropic effect on hearts and increase the heart rate by directly stimulating the 1-adrenoreceptors. unlike noradrenaline, the  xxxd2799xxx 
 xxxd1845xxx  [22] exerts its positive inotropic effect by inhibiting na+,k+-atpase activity, decreasing the driving
force for the na+/ca2+ exchange and increasing the cellular content and release of ca2+ during depolarization
[23]. these two drugs were used as the positive control to
evaluate the cardiotonic effect of brazilein and discuss the
mechanism of this effect in this study.
our results showed that brazilein produced a concentration-dependent cardiotonic action with little effect on
heart rate and coronary perfusion. at the same time, isolated rat hearts were treated with propranolol hydrochloride (a -adrenoceptor-blocking agent) in combination
with brazilein. this treatment abolished the cardiotonic
action of noradrenaline, whereas the cardiotonic action
of brazilein remained unaltered, suggesting that this effect does not involve direct or indirect stimulation of adrenoceptors. on the other hand, it was found that both
brazilein and  xxxd1845xxx  exhibited a cardiotonic effect

without having an effect on heart rate and coronary perfusion. accordingly, it was supposed that brazilein and
 xxxd1845xxx  might have the same mechanism.
as we know,  xxxd1845xxx  produces its positive inotropic effect by inhibiting na+,k+-atpase activity. so the
effect of brazilein on na+,k+-atpase activity was investigated in our experiments.
the results indicate that brazilein showed a low potency to inhibit the erythrocyte na+,k+-atpase, which
could be almost abolished by  xxxd1845xxx . as for another
molecule with a non-steroidal skeleton [24–26], brazilein
exhibited a different inhibition curve with a maximum
inhibition rate of about 50%, which could be suggested
by in vivo ecg research. in this study,  xxxd1845xxx  (about
400–560 g/kg) induced a series of ecg changes in cardiac glycosides at therapeutic doses, followed by ventricular arrhythmias and death. brazilein also induced the
same ecg changes as cardiac glycosides at a dose of
about 4–32 mg/kg, but it failed to induce ventricular arrhythmias even at a dose of 48 mg/kg. these indicated
that brazilein might have less adverse effects and a higher therapeutic index than cardiac glycosides.
na+,k+-atpase is the receptor for cardiac glycosides
[27, 28]. cardiac glycosides inhibit the enzyme by binding to its extracellular surface. as to the mechanism of
inhibition, cardiac glycosides may combine with e2p to
form e2p-cardiac glycosides, which prevents e2p from
binding with k+ to form e2p k2+ [27, 29]. it can be conﬁrmed by the phenomenon that a high concentration of
potassium can antagonize the inhibitory effect of cardiac
glycosides on na+,k+-atpase and accelerate the conversion of the  xxxd2799xxx -binding state e2p to nonbinding forms [29–31]. however, in our experiments, the
increase in k+ concentration did not affect the inhibition
induced by brazilein, suggesting that the inhibitory effect
of brazilein on na+,k+-atpase might not be associated
with the conformational state e2p. these facts suggest
that brazilein exhibits a different pattern of na+,k+atpase inhibition than  xxxd1845xxx , the  xxxd2799xxx  used in vitro.
in conclusion, the main contribution of this work is
the characterization of a non-steroidal molecular structure that can inhibit the erythrocyte na+,k+-atpase with
a different inhibition curve from that of cardiac glycosides. the next step is to conﬁrm the effect of brazilein
on heart failure through whole-animal experiments, and
discuss the action targets of brazilein on na+,k+-atpase,
which will facilitate brazilein to serve as a structural paradigm to develop new inotropic drugs necessary for a safer therapeutic approach to heart failure treatment.
