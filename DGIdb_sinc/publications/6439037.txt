identical twin brothers presented with oligospermia, small testes,
normal male phenotypes, elevated serum luteinizing hormone levels,
and normal or elevated serum testosterone levels. both men had
low to low-normal cytosol  xxxg183xxx  binding capacity in
cultured fibroblasts from pubic skin biopsy specimens. qualitative
abnormalities of cellular androgen receptors were suggested by
low-normal or low nuclear androgen uptake in fibroblasts from both
brothers as well as abnormal thermolability and subnormal molybdate stabilization of androgen receptors from one brother. in vivo
androgen sensitivity was assessed in one twin following adminlstration of testosterone or the non-aromatizable androgen  xxxd2136xxx .  xxxd2136xxx  suppressed serum luteinizing hormone
and serum testosterone/estradiol-binding
globulin, and although
testosterone suppressed both serum luteinizing hormone and serum
follicle-stimulating hormone, the suppression of serum luteinizing
hormone by testosterone was subnormal. both subjects showed
marked exaggeration of the serum 17- xxxd2303xxx  increase
after administration of human  xxxd2228xxx , despite normal
serum testosterone increases, suggesting a block in testicular
17,20-desmolase, which converts 17- xxxd2303xxx  to testosterone. these studies suggest that oligospermia and block of the
enzyme 17,20-desmolase may be the earliest manifestations of
androgen resistance, and the finding of the syndrome of oligospermia, normal male phenotype, and  xxxg183xxx  abnormalltles
in identical twins indicates a genetic etiology of this disorder.
the androgen resistance syndromes are a spectrum of disorders that
range from  xxxg183xxx , associated with complete absence
of the  xxxg183xxx  in phenotypic females, through reifenstein’s
syndrome and similar disorders of partial  xxxg183xxx  deficiency
associated with hypospadias and/or gynecomastia, to isolated oligospermia in phenotypicaiiy normal men [ 11. griffin and colleagues
[2-41 have shown that such oiigospermic men may have quantitative
deficiencies in the  xxxg183xxx  and/or qualitative receptor
abnormalities, as detected by receptor thermolability or lack of cytosol
receptor stabilization by  xxxd3216xxx . in addition, eil [5] has
shown that fibroblasts from some patients with androgen resistance
may have normal cytosol androgen receptors that are defective in
transporting and localizing androgen into the nucleus of the cell.
this rep&t describes the cii&al
features as well as fibrobiast
 xxxg183xxx  abnormalities in identical twin brothers who presented with normal male phenotypes, infertility, and severe oiigospermia.

patients and methods
serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating
hormone,
testosterone, estradiol, thyroxine, and 17- xxxd2303xxx  were measured by radioimmunoassay. the binding
capacity of serum testosterone/estradiol-binding globulin was
measured as previously described [6]. human chorionic
gonadotropin stimulation tests were performed by administering 4,000 units intramuscularly per day for three doses.
peripheral blood chromosome analysis utilized the method
of yunis [7]. one hundred metaphases were counted, and
two to three giemsaltrypsin-banded
karyotypes prepared
from each patient. chromosomal polymorphisms
were
identified with both quinacrine and centromeric banding.
zygosity of the twins was assessed by red cell phenotyping
(rh, abo, mns, p, kell, duffy, kidd, lewis), hla typing, and
comparison of dermatoglyphic patterns.
 xxxg183xxx  studies were performed on fibroblast
strains established from punch biopsy specimens of mans
pubis or genital skin. whole cell androgen binding was determined as previously described [4,5], with binding capacity
expressed as sites per cell or fmol/mg protein. nuclear
binding of 3h-labeled dihydrotestosterone
was determined
to evaluate qualitative abnormalities in androgen action [5].

additional qualitative aspects of  xxxg183xxx  binding
were examined using thermolability studies and sucrose
density gradient analysis as previously described [4].
patient 1. the propositus presented at age 20 complaining
of recent difficulty maintaining an erection and infertility for
one year. the patient began puberty at age 11 and thereafter
had normal appearance of pubic and axillary hair, phallic
enlargement, and beard development. there were no recent
changes in facial hair. he denied any history of orchitis,
testicular trauma, headache, visual disturbance, or decreased
olfaction. a family history could not be obtained because he
and his brother (patient 2) were adopted as infants. physical
examination showed his height to be 181.6 cm (upper segment 81.3 cm), weight 68.6 kg, and blood pressure was
115/65 mm hg. visual fields and sense of smell were normal.
the patient had abundant chest, abdominal, axillaly, and pubic
hair, a mustache, and moderate facial hair. there was no
gynecon sstia. the phallus was of normal adult size with no
hypospadias, and testicular volume (determined with an orchidometer) was 12 ml on the right and 15 ml on the left
(normal volume 20 to 25 ml). prostatic tissue was palpable,
and results of neurologic examination and skull radiography
were normal. semen analysis on 11 occasions over seven
years showed sperm density ranging from less than
1,ooo,ooo
to 8,400,00o/mi. testicular biopsy revealed the
presence of spermatogenesis but with some patchy tubular
sclerosis.
patient 2. the twin of the propositus was evaluated because
of his brother’s medical history. he was unmarried at the time
of evaluation and gave no history of impotence or infertility.
the patient went through a normal puberty beginning at age
12. he denied a history of orchitis or testicular trauma.
physical examination showed his height to be 180.3 cm
(upper segment 83.8 cm), weight 64.4 kg, and blood pressure
120/78 mm hg. like his brother, the only abnormality on
physical examination

was bilateral small testicular size (right

12 ml, left 15 ml), and his sperm density ranged from

4,000,oooto 12,000,000/ml.
results
baseline hormone values.
basal serum luteinizing
hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone levels were
elevated in both subjects (table i), and in patient 1,
serum luteinizing hormone hyper-responded
following
intravenous
administration
of 100 pg of luteinizing
hormone-releasing
hormone (peak 3067 percent above
basal) and remained elevated (400 percent above basal)

at 180 minutes after injection. basal serum testosterone
was normal (patient 1) or elevated (patient 2) whereas
basal serum 17- xxxd2303xxx 
was normal in
both subjects. patient 1 had a normal serum dihydrotestosterone level of 77 ng/dl (normal 30 to 85 ng/dl).
serum estradiol and prolactin levels were slightly elevated in patient 2. following three days’ administration
of human  xxxd2228xxx , the increments and
absolute levels of serum testosterone were similar to
those in normal subjects (table ii). in contrast, the re-

sponse of 17- xxxd2303xxx 
following human
chorionic
gonadotropin
administration
was much
greater in both patients than in control subjects [8], on
both an absolute and a percentage basis (table ii).
androgen sensitivity studies. testosterone infusion
(15 mg a day for five days) was performed in patient 1,
with blood sampling every 20 minutes for eight hours
prior to and at the end of the infusion. serum testosterone doubled, producing a 22 percent reduction in
mean serum luteinizing hormone levels. this is a
smaller degree of suppression than that seen in four
normal men (45 f 7 percent) who underwent the same
protocol [9]. serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels
decreased by 44 percent, similar to that in normal men
(38 f 12 percent). to ascertain whether or not this
gonadotropin suppression might have been mediated
via the estradiol derived from the testosterone infusion,
we gave the patient  xxxd2136xxx  (30 mg daily for
seven days), an androgen that cannot be converted to
estrogen. morning blood samples were obtained for
three days before and on the last three days of  xxxd2136xxx  administration to assess both the suppression of serum gonadotropin levels as well as the decrease in serum testosterone/estradiol-binding
globulin
levels, the latter being an androgendependent process
[lo]. after  xxxd2136xxx , mean (& se) serum luteinizing hormone decreased from 20.7 f 0.4 to 16.4
f 1.3 mlu/ml (p <0.05), serum testosterone from 628
f 11 to 219 f 52 ng/di (p <o.o 125), and serum testosterone/estradiol-binding
globulin from 0.55 f 0.05
to 0.32 f 0.08 pg/dl. this reduction in serum luteinizing
hormone was less than the 49 percent mean decrease
observed in four normal men receiving  xxxd2136xxx 
for only three days [9].

 xxxg183xxx  studies (table iii). fibrobiasts
from patient 1 had low-normal whole cell binding of
3h-labeled dihydrotestosterone
but normal nuclear
uptake of androgen and normal binding affinities. fibroblasts from patient 2 also had low-normal androgen
binding capacities in whole ceils and low nuclear
binding, with whole cell binding affinity also at the low
end of the normal range. when patient 1 was restudied
at a later date with a second biopsy, whole ceil binding
(assessed using the synthetic androgen methyltrienelone, rl881) was below the normal range, and nuclear
uptake was low-normal. in another laboratory (j.e.g),
it was found that fibroblasts from patient 1 had low
3h-labeled dihydrotestosterone binding at 37’c, with
a marked further reduction in binding at 42oc. in this
patient, fibroblast 5-alpha-reductase activity at ph 5.5
was 5.1 pmol/hour/mg protein (normal more than 1.o).
the  xxxg183xxx  in these cells also had a qualitative defect shown by a lack of molybdate stabilization
as determined by sucrose gradient analysis (figure

the chromosome counts of 100 peripheral blood metaphases from each brother were uniformly 46, and all cells contained a normal appearing
y chromosome. two giemsa/trypsin-banded
karyotypes of patient 1 and three of patient 2 were ail 46,xy,
with a normal polymorphic variant of chromosome 15
(15p-t). no differences between the twins in other less
prominent polymorphisms of the d and g chromosomes
were observed with quinacrine, and the y chromosome
of each had a highly fluorescent terminal portion of the
long arm. centromeric banding showed no unusual
variation of the y chromosomes or other heterochromatic regions of the karyotype in either twin. the kar-

the androgen resistance syndromes represent a
spectrum of disorders. complete  xxxg183xxx ,
the most severe form of male pseudohermaphroditism,
is characterized by a female phenotype, profound resistance to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and,
in many instances, the absence of androgen receptors
as detected by hormone binding [ 11. less severely
affected men with androgen resistance may present a
more masculine appearance but with ambiguous genitalia and gynecomastia as well as abnormalities in
cellular androgen receptors. griffin and associates [3,4]
have shown that some oligospermic men with normal
male phenotypes have mild quantitative and/or qualitative defects in androgen receptors, representing the
opposite end of the clinical spectrum of androgen
resistance.
we have identified identical twin brothers who fall
into the latter category. they have oligospermia, small
testes, normal male phenotypes, and normal or elevated
serum testosterone levels. androgen resistance was
initially suggested in patient 1 by elevated luteinizing
hormone levels in the presence of a high-normal testosterone value [ 131, although his luteinizing hormone
level was in the normal range at other times. aiman and
griffin [3] have shown that the luteinizing hormone/
testosterone product need not be elevated in all infertile
males with abnormal androgen receptors.
our patients had low to low-normal androgen binding
capacity in intact cultured skin fibroblasts as measured
in two independent laboratories. in addition, fibroblast
androgen receptors from one patient had qualitative
defects as shown both by thermolability of dihydrotestosterone binding in intact cells [ 141 and by failure of
stabilization of fibroblast cytosol  xxxg183xxx  by
 xxxd3216xxx  on sucrose gradients [4]. furthermore, nuclear androgen uptake, perhaps a more
physiologically
important parameter than cytosol
binding for assessing the integrity of the  xxxg183xxx  system, was low-normal or low in both brothers.
although these studies demonstrate a cytosolic and/or
nuclear  xxxg183xxx  abnormality, a post-receptor
defect contributing to the pathogenesis of androgen
resistance may also be present. despite these androgen
receptor abnormalities, patient #l showed a substantial
response to exogenous androgen administration. although the decrease in his serum luteinizing hormone
level after testosterone administration was somewhat
less than normal, the serum follicle-stimulating hormone
showed normal suppression, and there was a dramatic
decrease in serum luteinizing hormone and testosterone/estradiol-binding
globulin levels within one week
after  xxxd2136xxx .
these findings suggest that
androgen sensitivity may vary between tissues or that

volume 77

oligospermia in identical twins-smallridge et al

some tissue androgen effects are not mediated via the
 xxxg183xxx  we studied.
the familial nature of the oligospermia and the  xxxg183xxx  abnormalities in both patients suggest
a cause-and-effect
relationship between these two
phenomena. the nuclear uptake studies indicate that
the qualitative receptor defect is associated with only
a partial impairment of nuclear androgen localization.
likewise, the biologic sensitivity of patient 1 to exogenous androgen administration and the normal male
phenotypes in both men suggest that in vivo androgen
resistance is not complete. if their oligospermia reflects
an abnormality of androgen action, these findings
suggest that the germ cell may be more sensitive to this
abnormality than other androgen target tissues. alternatively, the abnormalities in fibroblast androgen receptors may merely reflect a genetic abnormality that
independently affects germ cell development. without
an exogenous mechanism for improving the androgen
receptor level and/or function, these possibilities cannot
be distinguished at present.
testicular androgen production is generally unimpaired in patients with androgen resistance syndromes,
and absolute and percentage serum testosterone increments after human  xxxd2228xxx  administration were normal in our subjects. to our surprise,
the serum 17- xxxd2303xxx  levels after human
 xxxd2228xxx  administration
were much
higher in our patients than in control subjects [8]. the
combination of an exaggerated serum 17- xxxd2303xxx  response and a normal testosterone response to human  xxxd2228xxx  raises the
possibility of an impairment in conversion of 17- xxxd2303xxx  to testosterone (i.e., a block in the
17,20-desmolase enzyme). such a block has been
previously associated with elevated serum gonadotropins of exogenous or endogenous origin [ 151. both
our subjects had elevated serum luteinizing hormone

levels. such a gonadotropin-induced block in conversion of 17- xxxd2303xxx 
to testosterone may
be related to increases in testicular estrogen. in our
subjects, the presumed androgen resistance may have
increased the biologically effective estrogen/androgen
ratio in the testis, further potentiating the luteinizing
hormone-induced block in 17,20-desmolase.
the fact that our patients are monozygotic twins
suggests a genetic basis for their disorder. genetically
determined hypogonadism has been previously reported
in nine sets of twins with 47,xxy klinefelter’s syndrome
[ 16,171 and one set of monozygotic twins with a male
phenotype but a 46,xx karyotype [ 181. moreover, twins
are 3.4 times more common in the families of patients
with klinefelter’s syndrome than in the normal population [ 191, and twins are also more common in the
families with 45,x turner’s syndrome [ 181. however,
our patients had normal sex chromosomes, and we
know of no reported association of androgen resistance
with increased frequency of twinning. earlier studies
have indicated that the gene for the cytosolic androgen
receptor is on the x chromosome [ 201, but there are
insufficient data on segregation of incomplete androgen
resistance in families, including that of our patients, to
determine if all such patients are carriers of x-linked
mutations [21]. more detailed studies of pedigrees,
including analysis of hla, x-linked and other genetic
markers, and a search for lyonization of cellular abnormalities in tissues of females who are suspected
carriers would be informative. also, more sensitive
probes of  xxxg183xxx  structure and function
should shed light on these issues.
