class i antiarrhythmic drug effects on ouabain binding to guinea pig cardiac na+ -k+ atpase.  the notion that the inhibition of the mg2+ -dependent atp-hydrolytic function of the myocardial na+ -k+ atpase by class i antiarrhythmic agents occurs as a result of their binding to the same receptor sites as the digitalis glycosides was tested by performing competitive binding assays of [3h]ouabain (oua) with eight drugs: disopyramide,  xxxd1991xxx , lidocaine, lorcainide, phenytoin, procainamide, quinidine, and  xxxd3387xxx  in guinea pig heart microsomal preparations. in the first set of experiments, 10-200 microm concentrations of the drugs were preincubated with the enzyme and displacement assays performed with 250 nm oua. the drugs showed receptor occupancy of 19-32% at 50 microm, 25-44% at 100 microm, and 37-56% at 200 microm. then, 10-500 nm concentrations of oua were preincubated with the enzyme, and competitive assays were performed using 200 microm concentrations of the drugs. oua occupied 39-51% of the receptor sites at 100 nm, 44-67% at 250 nm, and 62-82% at 500 nm, displacing the drugs in a concentration-dependent fashion. the results show that antiarrhythmic drugs interact with the same or similar receptor sites as ouabain on the na+ -k+ atpase, pointing to a possible contribution of these interactions to the mechanism for their inhibitory actions on the enzyme, and perhaps their arrhythmogenic effects.
