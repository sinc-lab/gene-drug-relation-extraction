 xxxd1422xxx  activity of atypical antipsychotic drugs at human 5-hydroxytryptamine2c receptors.  clozapine is the prototype atypical antipsychotic drug, producing little or no extrapyramidal side effects, while improving negative symptoms of psychosis. clozapine's high affinity for serotonin receptors has been hypothesized to confer the unique antipsychotic properties of this drug. recently, we demonstrated that both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs are inverse agonists at constitutively active 5-hydroxytryptamine2a (5-ht(2a)) receptors. to determine whether  xxxd1422xxx  activity at 5-ht(2c) receptors plays a role in antipsychotic efficacy, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs were tested for inhibition of basal inositol phosphate production in mammalian cells expressing rat or human 5-ht(2c) receptors. atypical antipsychotic drugs ( xxxd3195xxx , clozapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, risperidone, zotepine, tiospirone, fluperlapine, tenilapine) displayed potent  xxxd1422xxx  activity at rat and human 5-ht(2c) receptors. typical antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine,  xxxd2511xxx , thioridazine,  xxxd3018xxx , perphenazine,  xxxd2580xxx , trifluperidol, fluphenazine, spiperone, haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , penfluridol,  xxxd3359xxx ) were devoid of  xxxd1422xxx  activity, with the exception of  xxxd2511xxx . we review the evidence that  xxxd2511xxx  has unique properties characteristic of both atypical and typical antipsychotic drugs. several typical antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine, thioridazine, spiperone,  xxxd3359xxx ) displayed neutral antagonist activity by reversing clozapine inverse agonism. these data suggest that 5-ht(2c)  xxxd1422xxx  activity is associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs with moderate to high affinity for 5-ht(2c) receptors, and imply that effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs on the 5-ht(2c) receptor may play a role in their unique clinical properties. these data also imply that dysfunction of brain 5-ht(2c) receptor systems may be one of the factors involved in the etiology of psychosis.
