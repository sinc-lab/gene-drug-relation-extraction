abstract
epilepsy is characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability and hypersynchronization. disruption of electroencephalographically (eeg) synchronized epileptiform discharges may be a possible therapy for epilepsy. in the present study, to clarify the role of eeg desynchronization on
epilepsy, we investigated the effect of modafinil, a potent wake-promoting substance with eeg desynchronization activity, on epilepsy in
mice and clarified the receptors involved in the suppression of seizure caused by maximal electroshock (mes) and pentylenetetrazol (ptz) kindling models. modafinil given at 22.5, 45, and 90 mg/kg, i.p. significantly decreased the incidence of tonic hindleg extension in mes seizure
models, and protected against ptz-induced convulsive behaviors in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, modafinil at 180 mg/kg exerted an
antiepileptic effect in the mes model; however, at the same dosage it increased the seizure stage in the ptz-kindling model. the antiepileptic
effect in both mes and ptz models was antagonized by the adrenergic  xxxg81xxx  antagonist terazosin, but not by the adrenergic a2 receptor
antagonist yohimbine or by dopaminergic receptor antagonists, sch-23390 (for d1 receptors) and haloperidol (for d2 ones).  xxxd3050xxx , a histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist, counteracted the antiepileptic action of modafinil in the ptz induced-kindling model, but not in the mes
seizure model. taken together, the present findings indicate that modafinil exerted its antiepileptic effect via adrenergic a1 and histaminergic
h1 receptors, and might be of potential use in the treatment of epilepsy.

1. introduction
epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting adults
and children around the world. it is characterized by abnormal
synchronization of neurons, and the hallmarks of a seizure are
hyperexcitability of neurons and hypersynchrony of neuronal
networks (stafstrom, 2006). however, the underlying mechanisms for this pathological synchrony are yet mostly hypothetical. nevertheless, a focus of interest is the hypothesis that
electroencephalogram (eeg) desynchronization should inhibit

epilepsy, which hypothesis is supported by the finding that
high-frequency stimulation produced eeg desynchronization
that significantly decreased generalized tonic-clonic and amygdala-kindled seizures (velasco et al., 2000; shi et al., 2006).
the 2 main sleep states, non-rapid eye movement (non-rem,
nrem) sleep and rem sleep, have contrasting effects on seizure (shouse et al., 2004). both wakefulness and rem sleep
have been identified as epilepsy-resistant phases (shouse
et al., 1996) with desynchronized eeg activity. in contrast, epileptiform discharges are likely to propagate during nrem
sleep with the synchronized eeg activity. epilepsy spike frequency was 4.6 times higher in nrem sleep than in rem sleep
(malow et al., 1997). similarly, the crucial role of eeg synchronization in modulating epileptiform abnormalities has
been observed in various forms of epilepsy (manni et al., 2005).

c.r. chen et al. / neuropharmacology 53 (2007) 534e541

desynchronization may play an important role in the antiepileptic mechanism of drugs that influence sleep structure. this
possibility led us to postulate that central nervous system
stimulants with desynchronization activity may have an antiepileptic effect. amphetamine has a problem in abuse and dependence, and may lead to indirect damage to the cns (romanelli
and smith, 2006). caffeine has a very short half-life from 2 to
4.5 h in humans, and its wake-promoting effect is only taken as
long as 120 min after ingestion (fredholm et al., 1999). these
shortcomings may restrict the clinic use of amphetamine and
caffeine in the treatment of epilepsy. on the other hand, modafinil is a potent and long-lasting wake-promoting substance
with only minimal side effects (e.g. no amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms after 9 weeks of daily treatment; usmnsg,
2000) and used in patients with excessive sleepiness associated
with a variety of sleep disorders including narcolepsy (mignot
et al., 2002). to clarify this hypothesis, we examined the anticonvulsive effect of modafinil.
although the mechanism underlying the arousal action of
modafinil remains uncertain, several in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that modafinil promotes wakefulness through an
increase in noradrenergic and dopaminergic transmission,
and activation of orexin neurons and the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus. modafinil enhances extracellular levels
of dopamine in the brain and increases wakefulness in rats
(murillo-rodriguez et al., 2007), decreases gaba release,
and increases glutamate release in various brain regions
(ferraro et al., 1997, 1998, 1999). it also activates orexinergic
hypothalamic neurons (chemelli et al., 1999) and the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus (scammell et al., 2000),
and increase central noradrenergic transmission (duteil
et al., 1990; de saint hilaire et al., 2001; stone et al., 2002).
interestingly, the receptors for noradrenaline, dopamine, and
histamine have long been postulated to be involved in the
pathophysiology of epileptogenesis (leurs et al., 1998; weinshenker and szot, 2002).
in the present study, we investigated the effect of modafinil
on epilepsy in mouse maximal electroshock (mes) and pentylenetetrazol (ptz)-kindling epilepsy models, and found
that modafinil given at a dose range of 22.5e90 mg/kg exhibited a potent antiepileptic effect in mice, which was
blocked by adrenergic  xxxg81xxx  (a1r) and histaminergic
 xxxg1078xxx  ( xxxg1078xxx ) antagonists.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male kunming strain mice (experimental animal center, fudan university), 10 weeks old and weighing 18e20 g, were used in the experiments. during the period of ptz injections, the animals were housed in individual cages
in an animal room maintained at a constant temperature (23  1  c) and relative humidity (60  5%) on an automatically controlled 12 h/12 h light/dark
cycle (lights on at 07:00). water and food were available ad libitum. behavioral experiments were carried out between 10:00 and 14:00. additionally,
all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to use only the number
of animals necessary to produce reliable scientific data. all experiments were
carried out in accordance with the national institutes of health guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals.

535

2.2. drugs
modafinil, ptz, adrenergic a1r antagonist terazosin, a2 receptor (a2r) antagonist yohimbine, dopaminergic  xxxg655xxx  (d1r) antagonist sch-23390,
 xxxg656xxx  ( xxxg656xxx ) antagonist haloperidol, and histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx  maleate were purchased from sigma. all drugs were freshly prepared prior to use, and injection volume (10 ml/kg) was kept constant. the
dosage selections, route of drug administration, and injection time of different
compounds were based on preliminary experiments and pharmacokinetic
considerations. modafinil was suspended and all other drugs were dissolved
in saline containing 0.5% dimethylsulphoxide.

2.3. epileptic models
2.3.1. maximal electroshock seizure (mes) method
the mes method produces reproducible tonic convulsion characterized by
tonic hindlimb extension (the). a current stimulus (0.4-s stimulus duration,
70 ma) was delivered by using ear electrodes attached to an electric stimulator
(2-mu-2; shanghai medical college, china) similar to that originally designed by swinyard et al. (1952). the mice were divided into 5 groups
(n ¼ 10), 4 experimental groups that received a respective injection of modafinil at 22.5, 45, 90, and 180 mg/kg in a dose volume of 10 ml/kg, and the control group, which received the identical volume of the vehicle. all the
treatments were applied 30 min before the electrical stimulation.
we determined the anticonvulsant activity of modafinil at 30 min and 4 h
after modafinil i.p. injection, and calculated the respective doses at which 50%
of the animals were protected from seizures (ed50). animals that did not
exhibit the were considered protected.
2.3.2. ptz-induced kindling seizure
to induce kindling, we gave mice ptz at a subconvulsant dose of 35 mg/
kg, i.p. every other day for a period of 3 weeks according to the standardized
procedure (wu et al., 2006). after each injection, the animals were observed
for 60 min; and the convulsive behavior was classified as follows (getova
et al., 1998): stage 0, no response; stage 1, ear and facial twitching; stage
2, myoclonic body jerks; stage 3, clonic forelimb convulsions; stage 4, generalized clonic convulsions, with turning to a side position; and stage 5, generalized clonic-tonic convulsions or death within 30 min. when a mouse
exhibited three times of stage 4 seizures, it was considered fully kindled;
and the treatment was then discontinued.
the kindled mice were divided into 5 groups and were injected i.p. as follows: for the control group, animals received the i.p. vehicle injection. for the
test groups, the mice were injected i.p. with modafinil at a dose of 22.5, 45, 90
or 180 mg/kg; and 30 min later were injected with ptz. the animals were observed for 1 h after the ptz injection to measure the latency to the onset of the
myoclonic jerks and generalized clonic convulsion. in the absence of seizures
within 30 min, the latency was taken as 1800 s.

2.4. study on receptor mechanism involved in antiepileptic
effect of modafinil
in this study, a dose of highly selective antagonists that did not affect the
seizure threshold was chosen to probe the role of a1-, a2-adrenoceptors, d1, d2
dopominergic receptors, and h1 histaminergic receptor in the antiepileptic effect of modafinil. thirty minutes before the modafinil injection (90 mg/kg),
mice pretreated with different doses of the a1r antagonist terazosin (0.13,
0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg, i.p.), a2r antagonist yohimbine (1 and 2 mg/kg i.p.),
d1r antagonist sch-23390 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.),  xxxg656xxx  antagonist haloperidol (1 and 2 mg/kg i.p.) or  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  (0.5 and 1 mg/kg,
i.p.), and then subjected to mes at 30 min and 4 h after the modafinil injection. in the case of the kindling model, the kindled mice (n ¼ 8e10) were
given terazosin, yohimbine, sch-23390, haloperidol or  xxxd3050xxx  30 min
before the modafinil (90 mg/kg) injection. thirty minutes after the modafinil
injection, the animals were treated with ptz; and the latency to the onset of
myoclonic jerks and generalized clonic convulsion and the mean stage score
were measured and analyzed statistically. in the absence of seizures within
30 min, the latency was taken as 1800 s.

536

the control mice were also injected with vehicle, terazosin, yohimbine,
sch-23390, haloperidol or  xxxd3050xxx  30 min before treatment with vehicle
instead of modafinil.

2.5. statistical analysis
all data are expressed as the mean  sem. seizure stages were evaluated
by using the mannewhitney u-test. the latency of seizure for groups was
assessed by dunnett’s test, and the comparison of the groups was done by
one-way anova followed by dunnett’s test. the grouped chi-square test
was initially used to determine the overall differences in the incidence of
the due to convulsions. if a significant effect was observed, individual differences were determined by using the single chi-square test. all statistical analyses were carried out by using spss 10.0 for windows. p < 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.

3. results
3.1. antiepileptic effect on mes-induced seizure
to examine the antiepileptic effect of modafinil in the mes
seizure model, we observed the protective effect of modafinil
against the mes-induced the at 0.5 h and 4 h after modafinil
administration. in the vehicle-treated group, 100% of the mice
exhibited tonic hind-limb extension. the tonic flexion of the
limbs occurred immediately after the shock and progressed
into tonic extension of the hind limbs followed by stupor
and recovery. as shown in fig. 1, modafinil given at 22.5,
45, and 90 mg/kg significantly decreased the incidence of
mes-induced the at 0.5 h to 50%, 30%, and 10%, respectively, of the value for the vehicle control. the antiepileptic effect lasted for 4 h after the drug treatment. at 4 h after the
administration of modafinil at 22.5 mg/kg, the incidence of
mes-induced the significantly decreased to 70% of the value
for the vehicle control, but this reduction was not statistically
significant. whereas when modafinil was given at 45 or
90 mg/kg, the incidence significantly decreased by 50%. the
ed50 for the anticonvulsive effect of modafinil was 22.5 mg/
kg at 0.5 h, and 45 mg/kg at 4 h after the i.p. injection. modafinil was given at 180 mg/kg, the incidence of mes-induced

the significantly decreased the value observed from the
vehicle control at 0.5 and 4 h to 30% and 60%, respectively.
however, the antiepileptic effect of modafinil at 180 mg/kg
was lower than that at 90 mg/kg. no mice were fetal in both
vehicle- and modafinil-treated groups. these results indicate
that modafinil given at 22.5, 45 and 90 mg/kg has a potent
antiepileptic effect against mes-induced seizures in a dosedependent manner and that the effect lasted for at least 4 h.
3.2. involvement of a1r in the antiepileptic effect of
modafinil in the mes model
to examine if adrenergic, dopaminergic, and/or histaminergic receptors were involved in the antiepileptic effect of modafinil, we used antagonists terazosin, yohimbine, sch-23390,
haloperidol, and  xxxd3050xxx  for adrenergic a1r, a2r, dopaminergic d1r,  xxxg656xxx , and histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx , respectively. as
shown in fig. 2, 100% of the mice in the vehicle-treated group
showed the mes-induced the; whereas only 10% mice exhibited the after electroshock in the group treated with modafinil at 90 mg/kg. the 5 receptor antagonists used alone at the
dose we selected did not alter the incidence of tonic extension
found for the vehicle-treated group. however, terazosin significantly reversed the protective effect of modafinil (90 mg/kg)
on mes-induced convulsions. treatment with modafinil after
injection of terazosin increased the incidence of the from
10% in the mice treated with modafinil alone to 50% and
70% in the mice with terazosin at 0.25 (p > 0.05) and
0.5 mg/kg (p < 0.05), respectively. however, the incidence
of 70% after treatment with terazosin at 0.5 mg/kg was not statistically significantly different from that of vehicle group
(fig. 2a), suggesting that terazosin at 0.5 mg/kg significantly
antagonized the decrease of incidence of tonic extension
caused by modafinil. pretreatment with yohimbine (1 and
2 mg/kg), sch-23390 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), haloperidol (1
and 2 mg/kg) or  xxxd3050xxx  (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) did not significantly antagonize the inhibitory effect of modafinil (figs.
2bee). these findings indicate that a1r mediated the antiepileptic effect of modafinil in this mouse mes model.

**p < 0.01, compared with the control group (chi-square test).

to test the antiepileptic effect of modafinil in ptz-kindling
seizure, we examined the seizure stage score and the onset latency of myoclonic jerks and generalized clonic convulsion for
1 h after the ptz injection, when modafinil was given at doses
of 22.5, 45, and 90 mg/kg 30 min prior to the last ptz injection. in the vehicle-treated mice, the latency of myoclonic jerk
and generalized clonus was 87  5 and 140  9 s, respectively. when given at a dose of 22.5, 45 or 90 mg/kg, modafinil significantly prolonged the latency to 112  3, 183  16,
and 191  19 s, respectively, for myoclonic jerk (fig. 3a),
and to 986  307, 1669  130, and 1683  116 s, respectively, for generalized clonus (fig. 3b).
as shown in fig. 3c, the mean seizure stage of the vehicletreated group was 4.3  0.2. when given at 22.5, 45 and

c.r. chen et al. / neuropharmacology 53 (2007) 534e541

537

90 mg/kg, modafinil dose-dependently decreased the mean
seizure stage to 3.4  0.3, 2.6  0.2, 2.5  0.3, respectively.
the stage distribution analysis (fig. 3d) revealed that all but
one vehicle-treated mice showed generalized clonic convulsions (stage 4), with turning to a side position; the one exception reached stage 5, presenting generalized clonic-tonic
convulsions and dying within 30 min. whereas none of the
modafinil-treated mice showed generalized clonic-tonic convulsions (stage 5); and the incidence for generalized clonic
convulsions (stage 4) decreased to 50%, 12.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. the incidence for myoclonic jerk (stage 2) reached
to 12.5%, 50% and 62.5% after modafinil had been given at
22.5, 45, and 90 mg/kg, respectively. one mouse died in the
vehicle group, but all mice survived in the groups treated
with modafinil at 22.5, 45 or 90 mg/kg. these results indicate
that modafinil at 22.5, 45, and 90 mg/kg attenuated the seizure
severity and prolonged the latency of seizure onset in the ptzkindling seizure model in a dose-dependent manner.
it is to be noted that when modifinil was given at a dose
more than 180 mg/kg, it increased the seizure stage in the
ptz-kindling model. as shown in fig. 3, modafinil at
180 mg/kg significantly decreased the latency to 77  3 s
and 106  3 s for myoclonic jerk and generalized clonus
(figs. 3a,b), respectively, and significantly increased the
mean seizure stage to 4.4  0.2 (fig. 3c). the stage distribution analysis (fig. 3d) revealed that all mice treated with modafinil at 180 mg/kg showed generalized clonic convulsions
(stage 4), three of which died within 30 min (stage 5). further
investigation is required to elucidate the mechanism by which
high dose of 180 mg/kg modafinil exhibits proconvulsion in
the ptz model. these findings suggest that the antiepileptic
effect of modafinil is limited to a low dose in a range from
22.5 to 90 mg/kg.
3.4. involvement of a1r and  xxxg1078xxx  in the antiepileptic
effect of modafinil in the ptz-kindling model
as in the experiments using the mes model, we used antagonists terazosin, yohimbine, sch-23390, haloperidol, and
 xxxd3050xxx  to identify the receptor involved in the antiepileptic
effect of modafinil in the ptz-kindling model. as shown in
fig. 4, modafinil at 90 mg/kg prolonged the latency of seizure
onset and lowered the mean seizure stage, as compared with
the values for the vehicle group. pretreatment with terazosin
(1 mg/kg) or  xxxd3050xxx  (1 mg/kg) completely antagonized
the prolonged onset latency of myoclonic jerks and generalized clonus and the mean seizure stage lowered by modafinil
at 90 mg/kg, although these 2 antagonists used alone did not

alter the latency of seizure onset or the mean seizure stage
(fig. 4). pretreatment with yohimbine (2 mg/kg), sch23390 (0.5 mg/kg) or haloperidol (2 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the antiepileptic effect of modafinil. these results
suggest that adrenergic a1r and histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx  were involved in the antiepileptic effect of modafinil in the ptz-kindling model.
4. discussion
this study clearly demonstrated that modafinil, a potent
wake-promoting drug with eeg desynchronization action, exerted an antiepileptic effect in a dose-dependent manner when
given at doses from 22.5 to 90 mg/kg. the antiepileptic effect
of modafinil was antagonized by the adrenergic a1r antagonist
terazosin in the mes model and by either terazosin or histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx  blocker  xxxd3050xxx  in the ptz-kindling model,
but not by the other antagonists for a2r, d1r and  xxxg656xxx , suggesting that adrenergic a1r and histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx  are involved the antiepileptic effect of modafinil.
 xxxg1078xxx  has been reported to mediate the anticonvulsive effect
of histamine (kamei et al., 1998).  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, such as
 xxxd3050xxx , diphenhydramine, methapyrilene, and chlorpheniramine, are brain-penetrating drugs with sleep-promoting effects (kaneko et al., 2000) and induce seizure in human beings
and rats (kamei et al., 2000), accelerate rat kindling seizures
(yokoyama et al., 1996), and lower the mouse ptz seizure
threshold (scherkl et al., 1991). genetic  xxxg1078xxx  knockout mice,
which have fewer transitions of sleep to wakefulness and are
deficit in arousal maintenance (huang et al., 2006), show accelerated development of ptz-induced kindling (chen et al.,
2003).  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists in clinical use are well known for their
sleep-inducing side effects. in cats, slow-wave sleep is induced
by microinjections of a selective  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist into the preoptic area (lin et al., 1994), and by inhibition of the histaminergic system through an  xxxg82xxx  activation that
induces an increase in gaba release in the tmn (hong et al.,
2005b). in contrast, some other studies showed that the activation of histaminergic systems by  xxxg83xxx   xxxg1080xxx  antagonist
(huang et al., 2006) and orexin (huang et al., 2001; hong
et al., 2005a) promotes wakefulness in wild-type mice, but
not in  xxxg1078xxx  knockout mice, indicating the importance of  xxxg1078xxx 
in histamine-induced wakefulness (huang et al., 2007). most
recently we reported that deep brain stimulation targeted to
the tuberomammillary nucleus, a sole region where cell bodies
of the histaminergic neurons are located, activates the histaminergic system and induces desynchronization to inhibit
ptz-induced seizure in rats. the antiepileptic effect of deep
brain stimulation to the tuberomammillary nucleus was also

blocked by an  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist (nishida et al., 2007). modafinil
significantly increases histamine release and enhances c-fos
immunoreactivity in the tuberomammillary nucleus (scammell et al., 2000; ishizuka et al., 2003). in the present study,
we found that modafinil exerted an antiepileptic effect that
was blocked by  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist, indicating that  xxxg1078xxx  mediated
the antiepileptic effect of modafinil.
it has been reported that the adrenergic system plays an important role in epilepsy. many previous studies have shown
that a1r activation is typically anticonvulsant, while a1r
blockade is typically proconvulsant (chauvel and trottier,
1986; weinshenker and szot, 2002). in the anticonvulsant activities of therapies used clinically to treat epilepsy, valproate,
as well as the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin,
and a ketogenic diet, increases central norepinephrine levels

539

(baf et al., 1994a,b; meshkibaf et al., 1995; sands et al.,
2000). in addition, the anticonvulsant effects of phenobarbital,
phenytoin, and the ketogenic diet are attenuated in the absence
of functional noradrenergic systems, and animals lacking
a functional noradrenergic system are generally more seizure-sensitive than control animals (waller and buterbaugh,
1985; krahl et al., 1998; szot et al., 2001). modafinil could occupy and modulate the noradrenaline transporter (madras
et al., 2006), block the reuptake of noradrenaline (gallopin
et al., 2004), and increase central noradrenergic transmission
(duteil et al., 1990; de saint hilaire et al., 2001; stone
et al., 2002). here we found that adrenergic systems mediate
the antiepileptic effects of modafinil in both mes and ptzkindling models. the antiepileptic effect mediated by adrenergic
a1r was also supported by the following reports: the wakepromoting effect of modafinil could be antagonized by a1r
antagonists terazosin (wisor and eriksson, 2005), and central
pharmacological blockade or genetic ablation of a1br markedly attenuates the behavioral activation caused by modafinil
(stone et al., 2002).
the ptz-kindling model is considered as an example of repeated network synchronization and to be more closely related
to human epilepsy than acute chemoconvulant models; and it
has been used as a laboratory model of human partial complex
epilepsy (hansen et al., 2004). on the other hand, mes is
a widely used model of generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy. interestingly, although terazosin decreased the inhibitory effects
of modafinil in both models, the pretreatment with  xxxd3050xxx 
reversed the inhibitory action of modafinil in the ptz-kindling
seizure model but not in the mes one, suggesting that different mechanisms by which epilepsy is induced exist between
these 2 models.
modafinil at doses of 22.5, 45, and 90 mg/kg significantly
decreased the seizure stage and prolonged the latency of
myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a dosedependent manner. however, we found that modafinil given at
the doses higher than 180 mg/kg aggravated epilepsy in the
ptz-kindling model. the finding that the lower doses of modafinil were antiepileptic, whereas the higher doses increased
the seizure stage suggests a biphasic action of modafinil in the
kindling model. this dose-dependent effect of modafinil is typical of most drugs that show an inverted-u dose-response curve.
a similar phenomenon was observed for carnosine, a precursor
of histamine, which at the lower doses protected against ptzkindled seizures, decreasing at the higher doses with markedly
increased histamine levels (wu et al., 2006). these results suggest that dosage choice is important in epilepsy therapy of modafinil and that a high dose should be avoided.
in conclusion, a low dose of modafinil exerts antiepileptic
effect which is mediated by adrenergic a1r and histaminergic
 xxxg1078xxx . our findings may provide a potential therapeutic approach for epilepsy.
