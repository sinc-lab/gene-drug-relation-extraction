for the treatment of severe pain in non-depressed patients [5,18]
on the rational that they block reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline, involved in pain modulation [19,20]. nevertheless, their
exact antinociceptive mechanism of action is still unclear. it apparently involves either a direct, central potentiation of the endogenous
opioid system [4] or activation of a mixed antinociceptive effect
mediated by serotonergic and/or noradrenergic pathways [2,11,20]
or various combinations of these mechanisms. sacerdote et al.
[11] concluded that the antinociceptive effect of clomipramine and
amitriptyline and their potentiation of morphine-induced antinociception seem to be related to an activation of the endogenous
opioid system mediated by serotonin.
moreover, some differences have been found regarding the efficacy of different antidepressants for severe forms of depression
(i.e. delusional depression) [6,8], a difference which cannot be explained just by the diversity of neurotransmitters recognized as
involved in the various mechanisms of action of these drugs. by
identifying those antidepressants of the newer generations, which
interact with the opioid system, we may add important knowledge for both pain management and antidepressant drug treatment
choice [1].
mirtazapine is a new antidepressant, one of a chemical series
of compounds known as piperazinoazepines which is not related
to any known class of psychotropic drugs. mirtazapine enhances
noraderenergic and 5-ht1a -mediated serotonergic neurotransmission via antagonism of central alpha 2 -auto- and hetero-adrenoreceptors
[3,7]. mirtazapine does not inhibit noradrenaline or serotonin
uptake, but, it blocks specifically the 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 type receptors, while failing to modulate monoamine reuptake in animal
models. in these models mirtazapine manifested a very low affinity for dopaminergic receptors and high affinity for histamine
h1 receptors [7]. however, it seems that mirtazapine’s intrinsic noradrenergic activity counteracts its histaminergic effects
[7].
mirtazapine’s unique pharmacological profile, which in part resembles that of  xxxd2637xxx  [15], suggests a combined serotonin–
noradrenaline-mediated antinociception, with a possible involve-

as the mirtazapine dose increased beyond 10 mg/kg latencies
returned to baseline, yielding a biphasic dose–response curve.
the effect of opioid, adrenergic, and serotonergic receptor antagonists was examined as to their ability to block mirtazapine
antinociception. mirtazapine ( xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg)-induced antinociception was signiﬁcantly inhibited by naloxone, nor-bni, and
naltrindole, but neither by beta-fna nor by naloxonazine, implying the involvement of kappa 1 - and delta-opioid mechanisms. when
adrenergic and serotonergic antagonists were used, both metergoline and yohimbine, decreased antinociception elicited
by mirtazapine, implying a combined serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanism of antinociception. when mirtazapine
was administered together with various agonists of the opioid
receptor subtypes, it signiﬁcantly potentiated antinociception
mediated only by kappa 3 -opioid receptor subtypes. summing up
these results we conclude that the antinociceptive effect of
mirtazapine is mainly inﬂuenced by the kappa 3 -opioid receptor
subtype combined with both serotonergic and noradrenergic
receptors. these results suggest a potential use of mirtazapine in the management of some pain syndromes, and raise
questions regarding a possible indirect opioid-dependence induced by mirtazapine. however, further research is needed in
order to establish both the exact clinical indications and the
effective doses of mirtazapine when prescribed for pain.

ment of the opioid system. in this study we examined this potential
antinociceptive effect using the mouse hotplate assay.
materials and methods
subjects and surgery
male icr mice from tel-aviv university colony (tel-aviv, israel), weight 25–35 g were used. the mice were maintained on
a 12 h light:12 h dark cycles with purina rodent chow and water
available ad libitum. animals were housed five per cage in a room
maintained at 22 ± 0.5◦ c until testing. mice were used only once.
central injections in mice were made under light halothane anesthesia, using a hamilton 10 µl syringe fitted to a 30 gauge needle with v1 tubing. intrathecal (i.t.) injections were introduced by
lumbar puncture [9].
agents
several agents were generously donated as follows: mirtazapine by n.v. organon (the netherlands); morphine by teva
(jerusalem, israel); naloxonazine by dr. g.w. pasternak from
memorial sloan-kettering cancer center, new york, usa;
u50, 488h {trans-3,4-dichloro-n-methyl-n-[2-(1-pyrrolindinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide} by upjohn pharmaceutics (west
sussex, england); (d-pen2,d-pen5)enkephalin (dpdpe), betafunaltrexamine (beta-fna), naltrindole hcl, nalorphine hcl,  xxxd2694xxx , and nor-binaltorphamine (nor-bni) were obtained from
the research technology branch of nida.  xxxd1993xxx  ( xxxd1993xxx )
was purchased from abbott (campoverde, italy). yohimbine hcl,
metergoline (n-cbz-[8b-1,6-dimethylergolin-8 yl] methylamine),
serotonin (5-hydrotryptamine creatinine sulphate) (5-ht), and
clonidine hcl were purchased from sigma (israel). all other compounds were purchased from commercial sources. yohimbine hcl
was dissolved in distilled water. all other drugs were dissolved
in saline; 5-ht contained 0.2 mg/ml  xxxd228xxx  in addition to
saline.
antinociception assessment
mice were tested with the hotplate analgesicmeter model 35d
(iitc inc., woodland hills, ca), as previously described [12]. the
device basically consists of a metal plate (40 cm×35 cm) heated to
a constant temperature, on which a plastic cylinder was placed. the
analgesicmeter was set to a plate temperature of 55.5 ± 0.5◦ c. the
time of latency was recorded between the second the animal was
placed on the hotplate surface until it licked its back paw or jerked
it strongly or jumped out. baseline latency was determined before
experimental treatment for each mouse as the mean of two trials.
post-treatment latencies were determined after 30 min for opioids,
which were subcutaneously (s.c.) administered and for mirtazapine,
which was intraperitoneally (i.p.), administrated. post-treatment
latencies were determined after 15 min for dpdpe, which was
administrated i.t. to minimize tissue damage a cut-off time 30 s was
adopted. antinociception was defined quantitatively as doubling of
baseline values for each mouse.
procedure
the study was conducted in three experiments.
experiment 1
groups of mice (n = 20) were injected i.p. with different doses
of mirtazapine (from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg) to determine the effect
of the drug in eliciting antinociception. normal motor behavior
was observed following mirtazapine injection.

experiment 2
the sensitivity of mirtazapine to specific opioid, adrenoreceptor,
and  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx  antagonists was examined. three different
doses of mirtazapine were used, the doses were chosen according to the dose–response curve: one dose from the increasing part
of the curve (2.5 mg/kg), one (10 mg/kg) at the pick of the curve,
and the third from the decreasing part of the curve (15 mg/kg).
first, we determined the effect of the non-selective opioid antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg, s.c.) on mirtazapine. naloxone inhibited
mirtazapine’s antinociceptive effect so we continued examining the
effect of the specific opioid antagonists on mirtazapine. mice (n =
20 in each group) administered with one of the three doses mirtazapine were treated with one of the following drugs: beta-fna (µ1
and µ2 antagonist; 40 mg/kg, s.c.) or naloxonazine (µ1 antagonist;
35 mg/kg, s.c.), 24 h before mirtazapine challenge. naltrindole (delta
antagonist) 20 mg/kg, s.c., nor-bni (kappa antagonist) 10 mg/kg, s.c.
or with saline, were injected at the same time with the different mirtazapine doses. for comparison, beta-fna and naloxonazine
were tested against morphine, nor-bni against u50, 488h, and
naltrindole against dpdpe, in separate groups of mice (data not
shown). all the drugs and doses used in the present work were chosen according with our previous works. subsequently, we examined the effects of metergoline (a serotonergic antagonist; 2 mg/kg,
i.p.) and yohimbine (an adrenergic antagonist; 4 mg/kg, i.p). the
drugs were injected 30 min after mirtazapine administration.
experiment 3
the sensitivity of mirtazapine to specific opioid, adrenergic,
and  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx  agonists was examined. the action of mirtazapine on selective opioid receptor subtype agonists was tested,
as follows: (a) groups of mice (n ≥ 15) were given increasing
doses of morphine, a µ receptor agonist with an inactive dose of
mirtazapine (0.25 mg/kg); (b) dpdpe, a selective  xxxg1632xxx  agonist was injected i.t. alone or with an inactive dose of mirtazapine;
(c) u50, 488h, a selective kappa 1 receptor agonist, was injected s.c.
alone or with an inactive dose of mirtazapine; (d) nalorphine a kappa 3
receptor agonist, was injected s.c. alone or with an inactive dose
of mirtazapine; (e) serotonin, a serotonergic receptor agonist was
injected s.c. alone or with an inactive dose of mirtazapine; and (f)
clonidine, an adrenergic receptor agonist was injected s.c. alone or
with an inactive dose of mirtazapine.
statistical analysis
dose–response curves were analyzed, using a spss computer
program. this program maximizes the log-likelihood function
to fit a parallel set of gaussian normal sigmoid curves to the
dose–response data. single dose antagonist studies were analyzed
using a 3 × 8 anova. the analysis was performed on the binary
antinociceptive response of the mice. in case of significant drug
by dose interaction post hoc analysis was performed using the
duncan method.
results
mirtazapine antinociceptive effect
screening of mirtazapine in mice demonstrated its efficacy as an
antinociceptive agent in the hotplate assay. therefore we evaluated
the antinociceptive effect of mirtazapine on mice in this analgesic
assay. at doses from 1 to 7.5 mg/kg, mirtazapine administered
i.p. produced an antinociceptive effect in the hotplate test in a dose
dependent manner (fig. 1). the antinociceptive effect observed
with 1 mg/kg was 20% while its effect observed with 7.5 mg/kg
mirtazapine elevated to 70%. as the mirtazapine dose increased

(i.p.) with various doses of mirtazapine. post-treatment latencies were
determined after 60 min.

beyond 10 mg/kg, hotplate latencies declined, yielding a biphasic
dose–response curve.
the sensitivity of mirtazapine antinociceptive effect
to selective opioid receptor antagonists
the analysis of naloxone showed a significant drug by dose interaction [f(2, 114) = 6.02, p < 0.01], post hoc analysis revealed
that the proportion of antinociceptic subjects differed at 2.5 and
10 mg/kg (p < 0.01 for both), but not at 15 mg/kg, implying that
there is an opioid mechanism of action involved in the mirtazapineinduced antinociceptive effect (fig. 2). at the next stage the involvement of the selective antagonists of µ, delta, and kappa 1 receptors was
assessed to evaluate the potential involvement in the mirtazapine
antinociceptive effect. we examined several selective antagonists
(fig. 2).
the doses of naltrindole and norbni that receptively reversed
dpdpe and u50, 488h antinociception, reversed the antinociceptive effect of mirtazapine. the analysis of naltrindole showed a
significant drug by dose interaction [f(2, 114) = 7.43, p < 0.01].
post hoc analysis revealed that the proportion of antinociceptic subjects differed at 2.5 mg/kg (p < 0.05) and 10 mg/kg (p < 0.01),
but not at 15 mg/kg. the analysis of nor-bni showed a significant
drug by dose interaction [f(2, 114) = 4.25, p < 0.05], post hoc
analysis revealed that the proportion of antinociceptic subjects differed  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg (p < 0.01), but not at 2.5 and 15 mg/kg (fig. 2).
beta-fna and naloxonazine given at a dose which blocked morphine
antinociception, failed to antagonize mirtazapine antinociceptive
effects (fig. 2). the activity of each of the antagonists was confirmed with its prototypic agonists (data not shown). none of the
antagonists mediated antinociception by themselves, nor did they
change the baseline latencies of the pre-treated animals.
the sensitivity of mirtazapine antinociceptive effect to selective
antagonists implies delta- and kappa 1 -mechanisms of action and to a lesser
extent µ-mechanisms.
mirtazapine action on selected opioid receptor subtypes agonists
mirtazapine–morphine (µ subtype) interactions. we gave the
selective agonists of the µ subtype morphine with or without an
inactive dose of mirtazapine (0.25 mg, i.p., table 1). we found no
significant shift in the dose–response. ed50 of morphine without

(yoh; 4 mg/kg), and metergoline (met; 2 mg/kg ). groups of mice (n =
20) were treated with mirtazapine alone (7.5 mg/kg) or were challenged
in addition with one of the additional drugs. naloxone, naltrindole, norbni, yohimbine, and metergoline significantly antagonized mirtazapine
antinociception (p < 0.05). all other drugs did not antagonize mirtazapine
antinociception.

mirtazapine was 5.3 mg/kg, s.c. (3.5, 10.3 95% cl) and with mirtazapine was 1.9 mg/kg, s.c. (1.1, 4.5).
mirtazapine–dpdpe (delta subtype) interactions. we gave the selective agonists of the delta subtype dpdpe with or without an inactive dose of mirtazapine (0.25 mg, i.p., table 1). we did not find
any differences between the groups. ed50 of dpdpe without mirtazapine was 307 ng, i.t. and with mirtazapine was 236 ng, i.t.

mirtazapine–nalorphine (kappa 3 subtype) interactions. we gave the
selective agonists of the kappa 3 subtype nalorphine with or without an
inactive dose of mirtazapine (0.25 mg, i.p., table 1). we found a
fourfold shift to the left in the dose–response curve (p < 0.05).
ed50 of nalorphine without mirtazapine was 27.7 mg/kg, s.c. (17.5,
149.8 95% cl) and with mirtazapine was 6.6 mg/kg, s.c. (3.6,
14.4).
these results suggest that mirtazapine when administered together with opiates, significantly potentiates antinociception mediated by kappa 3 -opioid receptor subtypes.
the sensitivity of mirtazapine antinociceptive effect to
serotonergic and adrenergic receptor antagonists
in order to assess the involvement of the serotonergic and
adrenergic systems in mirtazapine antinociceptive effect, the effect of yohimbine (an adrenergic antagonist) and metergoline (a
non-selective 5-ht receptor antagonist) were examined with mirtazapine (fig. 2). the antinociception induced by mirtazapine was
significantly inhibited by both yohimbine and metergoline. the
analysis of metergoline showed a significant drug by dose interaction [f(2, 114) = 3.25, p < 0.05], post hoc analysis revealed
that the proportion of antinociceptic subjects differed  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg
(p < 0.01), but not at 2.5 and 15 mg/kg. the analysis of yohimbine
showed a significant drug effect [f(1, 114) = 16.0, p < 0.01],
due to higher proportion of antinociceptic subjects in mirtazapine
alone compared to mirtazapine + yohimbine. these results imply
a combined serotonergic and adrenergic mechanism of action in
the mirtazapine-induced antinociception. the activity of each of
the antagonists was confirmed with its prototypic agonists (data
not shown). none of the antagonists mediated antinociception by
themselves, nor did they change the baseline latencies of the pretreated animals.
mirtazapine action on selected serotonergic and
adrenergic receptor subtypes agonists
mirtazapine–serotonergic interactions. we injected the nonselective 5-ht agonist serotonin with or without an inactive dose
of mirtazapine (0.25 mg, i.p., table 1). we found a threefold shift to
the left in the dose–response curve (p < 0.05). ed50 of serotonin
without mirtazapine was 1.7 mg/kg, (0.7.5, 9.4 95% cl) and with
mirtazapine was 0.6 mg/kg, (0.4, 1.0).
mirtazapine–adrenergic interactions. we gave clonidine with
or without an inactive dose of mirtazapine (0.25 mg, i.p., table 1).
we found a sixfold shift to the left in the dose–response curve
(p < 0.05). ed50 of clonidine without mirtazapine was 0.6 mg/kg,
(0.3, 2.1 95% cl) and with mirtazapine was 0.1 mg/kg, (0.1, 1.0).
these results indicated a clear involvement of the serotonergic
and adrenergic systems in mirtazapine antinociception.
discussion
in the present study, we found mirtazapine to induce a clear
antinociceptive effect in the mouse hotplate assay. at doses from
1 to 7.5 mg/kg, mirtazapine administered i.p. induced antinociception in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 1). as the mirtazapine dose
increased beyond 10 mg/kg, hotplate latencies declined yielding
a biphasic dose–response curve. this kind of response implies a
“therapeutic window effect” for mirtazapine-induced antinociception. mirtazapine’s induced antinociceptive effect was antagonized
by naloxone (implying an involvement of the opioid system), by the
non-selective serotonin antagonist metergoline (implying the involvement of 5-ht mechanisms) and by the alpha 2 adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (implying involvement of the noradrenergic system
as well). when administered together with various opioid receptor agonists, mirtazapine significantly potentiated antinociception

mediated by the kappa 3 -opioid receptor subtype, while co-administration
of mirtazapine with selective opioid antagonists demonstrated a
selective sensitivity of the delta- and kappa 1 -opioid subtypes. these results are not surprising, since mirtazapine pharmacological profile
did suggest a possible antinociceptive effect. furthermore, the
resemblance of mirtazapine’s pharmacological profile to that of
 xxxd2637xxx  (which was already found to induce an opioid-mediated
antinociceptive effect), suggested a possible involvement of an
opioid mechanism in mirtazapine-induced antinociception.
in a series of studies we evaluated the antinociceptive effect
and mechanisms of several antidepressants of the newer generation. when co-administered at inactive doses with various opioid
agonists, all the antidepressants studied were found to enhance
opioid antinociceptive effect. however, when administered alone,
most antidepressants studied were found to induce non-opioidmediated antinociception. moclobemide (a reversible inhibitor of
 xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx , rima), induced a selective alpha 2 -adrenergicmediated antinociception [14], while nefazodone, fluvoxamine, and
fluoxetine, induced a serotonergic-mediated antinociceptive effect
[10,12,13]. however,  xxxd2637xxx , venlafaxine, and trazodone involved in their antinociceptive effect the opioid system as well.
when injected alone i.p., the tetracyclic antidepressant  xxxd2637xxx 
elicited a biphasic dose-dependent antinociceptive effect abolished
by naloxone, indicating a possible involvement of opioid mechanisms [15]. venlafaxine, a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (potent), noradrenaline (moderate) and dopamine (weak) induced its
antinociceptive effect through a  xxxd2082xxx  on the opioid (mainly
the kappa- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes), and adrenergic (the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor) systems [16]. trazodone, when studied in the
same model, was found to induce a potent µ1 - and µ2 -opioid receptor mediated antinociception [17].
the mechanism of action of the mirtazapine-induced antinociceptive effect derives from its pharmacological profile. mirtazapine
blocks selectively 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 type receptors, and increases
noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission via a blockade
of the central alpha 2 -auto- and hetero-adrenoreceptors. the result is
a selective stimulation of the post-synaptic 5-ht1 type receptors,
which combined with mirtazapine’s high affinity for histamine h1
receptors, may contribute to the indirect involvement of the opioid
system, supraspinally.
the possible involvement of the opioid system in mirtazapineinduced antinociception raises two questions which may have
relevance not only to a possible use of this drug for treatment
of pain, but in psychiatry as well. one question regards possible withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of treatment, a
phenomenon already described with other antidepressants. these
withdrawal symptoms have usually been attributed to the effects of
the antidepressants on the serotoninergic system which may result
in noradrenergic rebound after discontinuation, or to a rebound
excess of cholinergic activity after prolonged anticholinergic effect
on cholinergic receptors rather than to a possible interaction with
the opioid system [21]. however, mirtazapine lacks cholinergic
activity, and if withdrawal symptoms appear upon abrupt discontinuation of treatment, opioid involvement should be looked for.
the second question is even of more importance in psychiatric use of antidepressants. although the efficacy of each
antidepressant available has been found equal to that of amitriptyline in double blind studies as far as mild to moderate depression is involved, it seems that some antidepressants are
more effective than others in the treatment of severe types of
depression, such as delusional depression [6,8]. we speculate that
the involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressant mechanism of action may be necessary, in order to prove effective in the
treatment of severe depression. among the antidepressants of the
newer generations, that involvement occurs with venlafaxine and

the antinociceptive effect of mirtazapine in mice
mirtazapine, but not with the ssris, or the rima. more studies
are needed both in order to establish the clinical indications and
dosages for the possible use of mirtazapine for the treatment of
pain, as well as to assess the possible validity of the hypothesis
regarding the role of opioid properties in antidepressants’ efficacy
for severe depression.
