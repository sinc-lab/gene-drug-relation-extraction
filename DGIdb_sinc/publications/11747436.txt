abstract: hiv-1 transactivating protein tat is essential for virus replication and progression of hiv
disease. hiv-1 tat stimulates transactivation by binding to hiv-1 transactivator responsive element (tar)
rna, and while secreted extracellularly, it acts as an immunosuppressor, an activator of quiescent t-cells
for productive hiv-1 infection, and by binding to cxc  xxxg565xxx  type 4 (cxcr4) as a chemokine
analogue. here we present a novel hiv-1 tat antagonist, a  xxxd2161xxx -hexaarginine conjugate (neor),
which inhibits tat transactivation and antagonizes tat extracellular activities, such as increased viral
production, induction of cxcr4 expression, suppression of cd3-activated proliferation of lymphocytes,
and upregulation of the cd8 receptor. moreover, tat inhibits binding of  xxxd2130xxx  isothiocyanate (fitc)labeled neor to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), indicating that tat and neor bind
to the same cellular target. this is further substantiated by the finding that neor competes with the
binding of monoclonal abs to cxcr4. furthermore, neor suppresses hiv-1 binding to cells. importantly,
neor accumulates in the cell nuclei and inhibits the replication of m- and t-tropic hiv-1 laboratory
isolates (ec50 ) 0.8-5.3 µm). a putative model structure for the tar-neor complex, which complies
with available experimental data, is presented. we conclude that neor is a multitarget hiv-1 inhibitor;
the structure, and molecular modeling and dynamics, suggest its binding to tar rna. neor inhibits
hiv-1 binding to cells, partially by blocking the cxcr4 hiv-1 coreceptor, and it antagonizes tat functions.
neor is therefore an attractive lead compound, capable of interfering with different stages of hiv infection
and aids pathogenesis.

the development of novel human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1)1 inhibitors, targeted against viral components
other than hiv reverse transcriptase (rt) or protease, is of
special importance in view of the failure, in many cases, of
the current antiretroviral therapies, and due to the emerging
and high variability of resistant hiv-1 strains. a current
direction in this field is the development of hiv transcription
 xxxg515xxx  (tat) inhibitors, which may be critical
for anti-aids strategies due to the multiplicity and diversity
of tat functions in the hiv life cycle and aids pathogenesis
(1-4). tat is a small (14 kda) multifunctional viral regulatory protein. its primary function is the transactivation of
the transcription from hiv long terminal repeats (reviewed

hiv gene regulator; while secreted extracellularly, it also
acts as an immunosuppressor, an activator of quiescent
t-cells for productive hiv-1 infection, a chemokine analogue, and an apoptosis inducer (2, 4, 7-9). tat also induces
peripheral blood mononucleated cell apoptosis (10, 11),
probably contributing to cd4+ t-cell depletion, characteristic of aids. in addition, extracellular tat upregulates

 xxxd2161xxx -arginine conjugates inhibit hiv tat
expression of chemokine receptors on lymphocytes, including
the expression of cxcr4 and ccr5 (12-14), which serve
as hiv-1 entry coreceptors, and enhances angiogenesis,
inducing kaposi’s sarcoma, an angioproliferative disease,
very frequent and aggressive in association with aids
(reviewed in ref 3).
these diverse functions of tat are mainly provided by the
cysteine rich domain (amino acids 21-40) (15) and the basic
domain of the protein (amino acids 49-57) constituted by a
stretch of repeated arg and lys residues (16-18). these
domains, which are well-conserved among tat proteins isolated from different strains of hiv-1 (15-17), are necessary
for tat stability (19) and interaction with nucleic acids (20).
moreover, peptides representing these domains are able to
enhance transactivation, induce hiv replication, and trigger
extracellular related tat activities (reviewed in ref 6).
the site of binding of tat protein on tar rna is
comprised of the ucu bulge and base pairs at both sides of
it (21, 22). tat interaction with tar is mediated by a nineamino acid region (rkkrrqrrr, residues 49-57) of the
protein. tat-derived basic peptides (23) and even a nonaarginine peptide (21) bind tar rna with high affinity in
vitro. much less efficient than peptides is the aminoglycoside
antibiotic  xxxd2161xxx  that binds to tar rna at the lower
stem and the uridine rich bulge region (24, 25), which adopts
a conformation different from that known for tar-tat
interactions (26, 27).
the development of tat protein inhibitors and antagonists
comprises an important direction in anti-aids drug discovery. on the basis of peptide models of tar rna binding,
nmr structures of tar-ligand complexes, and aminoglycoside-rna interactions, we designed and synthesized a novel
hiv-1 tat antagonist, a  xxxd2161xxx -arginine conjugate
(neor), and tested its activities against hiv-1 tat. this
aminoglycoside-arginine conjugate displays high affinity for
tar rna in vitro, readily penetrates cells, and inhibits tat
transactivation in cell culture. it also antagonizes tat
extracellular activities, such as increased viral production,
upregulation of cxcr4 hiv-1 coreceptor expression, suppression of cd3-activated proliferation of lymphocytes, and
upregulation of the cd8 receptor. in addition, neor inhibits
hiv-1 infection, partially by interacting with cxcr4 and
blocking hiv-1 binding to cells, making neor a highly
attractive hiv inhibitor.
preliminary attempts to study the structure of a complex
formed between tar rna and aminoglycoside-arginine
conjugates experimentally (e.g., by nmr, or crystallization
of such complexes) suggested that there is considerable
flexibility in these complexes. therefore, we undertook a
theoretical study to predict the modes of interaction between
tar and neor. we examined whether one or more binding
modes exist, and generated a putative model structure for
the tar-neor complex, which conforms to the available
experimental data.
experimental procedures
synthesis and characterization of the hexaarginineneomycin b conjugate (neor). neor (figure 1) was
synthesized as follows. approximately 5 mmol of a water
solution of free base aminoglycoside and  xxxd2161xxx  (fluka,
rehovot, israel) was used for the preparation of neor. for

each amino group of the aminoglycoside, 1.1 equiv of nrcarbobenzoxy-nomega-nitroarginine (sigma, rehovot, israel),
dissolved in 40 ml of an ethanol/dioxane/water (1:1.5:0.5)
mixture, and 1.2 equiv of a dry powder of 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (aldrich,
rehovot, israel) were added to the aminoglycoside solution
in 8-12 portions over the course of 24 h. the reaction was
allowed to proceed for an additional 24-36 h at room
temperature. the reaction progress was monitored by analytic
thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates in a chloroform/
methanol/water running buffer (1:1:0.3). after completion
of the reaction, the solvents were evaporated in vacuo, the
residue was then extracted subsequently with deionized
water, with 100 mm naoh, and again with deionized water.
the residue was dissolved in alcohol (75-80%) at 45 °c.
the protected conjugate was precipitated with an equal
volume of  xxxd2052xxx  at 4 °c. the residue was dissolved
in an alcohol/dioxane/water (1:1:1) mixture containing 1-1.5
equiv of acetic acid per each protected charged group (based
on theoretical yield), and hydrogenated at atmospheric
pressure for 12-20 h over 0.5 g of 10% pd/charcoal catalyst.
after this treatment, the solvents were evaporated in vacuo
and the residue was dissolved in water (or a water/alcohol
mixture), a fresh portion of acetic acid was added, and the
hydrogenation was continued for an additional 24 h. the
catalyst was removed by centrifugation, and the solution was
evaporated in vacuo, which was then dissolved in water
(neor acetate). the neor acetate salt was precipitated with
alcohol. the precipitate was collected by centrifugation,
washed with ether, and dried, which resulted in a hygroscopic
white powder of neor acetate salt (overall yield of ∼30%).
the compound was characterized by 1h and 13c nmr (see
results) and hplc, using a ymc aq c18 column (pore
size of 200 å) in a 25 min gradient from 0 to 50% acetonitrile
and water at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. peaks of interest, which
eluted at 13.4 min, correspond to the hexaarginine-neomycin
b conjugate as the main peak (∼90% of the total peak areas),
and several small peaks probably arise from different degrees
of arginine substitution (figure 1 of the supporting information). the main hplc peak was collected and further
identified by mass spectroscopy (malditof).

gel shift rna binding assay. binding of neor to hiv-1
tar rna was examined by gel shift analysis basically as
described previously (28, 29). briefly, a 31-residue tar
rna fragment (5′-ggc cag auc uga gcc ugg gag
cuc ucu ggc c-3′), containing residues 18-44 of hiv-1
ltr, synthesized by dharmacon research, inc. (boulder,
co), was 32p-5′-end-labeled with t4 polynucleotide kinase
(promega, madison, wi). the binding reaction mixtures (20
µl), containing 12 nm [32p]tar rna and neor in 10 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 70 mm nacl, 0.2 mm edta, and 5%
glycerol, were incubated for 10 min on ice and resolved by
electrophoresis on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel
(40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). for comparison, we used
the model tat hiv peptide [tat r52 (ykkkrkkkkka)]
as described previously (21). quantitations were obtained
by optical densitometry of the gels. different concentrations
of tar rna (6, 12, and 20 nm) were titrated with various
concentrations of the tat model peptide (r52) in the binding
reactions.  xxxg1128xxx  values are defined as the concentrations of
neor or tat r52 that produced 50% binding to tar rna.
fluorescence anisotropy measurement of the level of
rna binding. rhodamine-rev peptide (residues 34-50,
trqarrnrrrrwrerqr) (revrh) was prepared as
previously described (30), and used as a fluorescence probe
for binding to the 31-mer tar rna (described above). the
rhodamine moiety is attached to the peptide n-terminus via
an amide bond. the tar rna was annealed by heating to
95 °c with gradual cooling to room temperature. all stock
solutions were prepared in nuclease free water and were
diluted with appropriate buffers prior to use. rna concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and
the samples were re-annealed each time.
binding of revrh to hiv tar rna and neor competition with revrh on binding to tar rna were examined
with a fluorescence anisotropy assay (30, 31). fluorescence
anisotropy measurements were performed on an slmaminco model 8100 series 2 spectrometer (spectronic
instruments) equipped with a thermostat accurate to (0.1
°c. the tar binding samples (0-200 nm) were excited at
550 nm and monitored at 580 nm; the integration time was
4 s. every point consists of 10-20 measurements, and their
average values were used for calculation. measurements were
performed at 20 °c in a buffer solution containing 140 mm
nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, and 20 mm
hepes [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid]
(ph 7.5) (30). the revrh tracer concentration (0-70 nm)
was determined spectroscopically at 550 nm. different neor
concentrations (0-140 nm in 20 nm lots) were used for the
competition studies. the dissociation constants (kd) for the
rna and fluorescently labeled tracer (revrh), and the
dissociation constant (kd) of the rna and the competitor
(in our case, neor), were determined by nonlinear curve
fitting, using the equations described previously (30, 31),
and are presented as mean values of three independent
measurements (figure 2 of the supporting information).
cellular uptake using a fluorescent probe (neorfitc). the fluorescent derivative of neor was prepared by
reacting neor with fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc, sigma)
in a 1:1 molar ratio, in a water/methanol/dioxane (1:1:1, v/v)
mixture for 1 h at room temperature. after removal of the
solvents (under reduced pressure), the neor-fitc conjugate
was purified by extraction with  xxxd102xxx . the fitc

litovchick et al.
conjugate was finally dissolved in water. the fitc conjugation is via the n-r-amino group of the arginine. human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), separated from
a fresh blood sample on a  xxxd3253xxx  gradient by the standard
procedure and hippocampal neurons from rat puppies, were
cultured on polylysine-coated glass cover slides (28). the
cells were incubated with the neor-fitc conjugate in
hepes-buffered saline for 30 min. the slides were washed
several times with a saline solution and studied by confocal
laser-scanning microscopy on an axiovert 100m (zeiss)
microscope, using excitation at 488 nm (argon ion laser) and
emission detected in a band of 505-550 nm.
hiv-1 isolates and cell culture. pbmc, mt2, cmagi,
and u937 cell lines, and h9+ cells chronically infected with
hiv-1 iiib, were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium (gibcobrl, life technologies, paisley, u.k.) containing 10% fetal
calf serum (fcs). pbmc were isolated by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque
centrifugation from blood samples, obtained from hiv-1
sero-negative and hiv-1-infected donors through the aids
center at kaplan medical center. pbmc were stimulated
with 5 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin (pha) prior to use in
infection experiments. hiv-1-infected pbmc were cultured
for 3-4 days without pha stimulation. hiv-1 clade b (ttropic) primary clinical isolate, hiv-1 iiib and hiv-1 2d
laboratory strains, as well as 3′-azido-3′- xxxd3364xxx 
(azt), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3tc) (both are nucleoside hiv-1 rt inhibitors), and uc781 (non-nucleoside rt
inhibitor) resistant hiv-1 clinical isolates were propagated
by subculture in cd4+ mt2 cells. hiv-1 ba-l and hiv-1
jf-rl were propagated in cmagi cells. hiv-1 clade c
primary clinical isolate was propagated by subculture in
u937 cells. aliquots of cell free culture supernatants were
generally used as viral inocula.
neor was dissolved directly in the rpmi medium. cytotoxicity determinations were carried out with the tetrazoliumbased colorimetric assay (mtt assay), using a cell proliferation kit (celltiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation
assay, promega). viral growth was assessed by measurement
of cell viability using the mtt assay, by assaying the rt
activity levels in the culture supernatants (see below) and/
or by measuring hiv-1 p24 antigen levels (p24 antigen
capture kit, saic frederick, frederick, md), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. cytopathic effects of hiv
infection of cd4+ mt2 cells were also analyzed by
microscopic assessment of syncytium formation. the latter
data were obtained by analysis of duplicate samples by two
independent observers.
inhibition of hiv-1 infection by neor. mt2 cells or
pbmc were incubated at 37 °c with a multiplicity of
infection of hiv-1 of 0.2-0.5 in the presence or absence of
neor for several days without washing (protocol 1).
alternatively, after incubation for 2 h at 37 °c with the virus,
cells were washed and cultured in the presence or absence
of neor in the medium for several days (protocol 2). in a
third protocol of infection (protocol 3), the cells were infected
with hiv-1 in the presence or absence of neor for 2 h at
37 °c, washed, and then cultured for several days in the
absence of neor. in all protocols, half of the medium was
exchanged every 2 or 3 days with fresh medium, containing
the appropriate concentration of neor. the concentrations
that caused 50% inhibition of viral production (ec50) were
determined. in some experiments, the antiviral effect of

 xxxd2161xxx -arginine conjugates inhibit hiv tat
neor alone, azt alone, or a combination of both antiviral
compounds was examined.
reverse transcriptase assay. samples of culture medium
from the infected cells were collected and clarified from cell
debris by centrifugation at 5000g for 5 min. to 50 µl of
clarified medium samples was added 50 µl of rt cocktail
to the following final concentrations: 50 mm tris-hcl (ph
8.0), 2.5 mm mgcl2, 150 mm kcl, and 0.5 mm egta
( xxxg257xxx , dorset, u.k.), 0.05% triton x-100, 5 mm dtt
(dithiothreitol, sigma), 2% ethylene glycol, and 2.5 µg of
an annealed poly-ra/oligo-dt (sigma) template, and 5 µci
of 3h-labeled ttp (specific activity of 50 ci/mmol, amersham-pharmacia, piscataway, nj). the reaction mixture was
incubated at 37 °c for 2 h or overnight. following the
incubation, 900 µl of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid
(tca, sigma) was added to the reaction mixture. then the
samples were incubated for 15 min on ice and transferred
onto nitrocellulose filters (0.2 µm, millipore, bedford, ma),
and the filters were washed several times with 10% ice-cold
tca on a manifold device (sigma). the filters were dried
and transferred to scintillation vials, and the amount of
radioactivity was counted with a kodak lc counter by using
ultimagold scintillation liquid.
inhibition of tat-induced hiv-1 production by the infected
cells. chronically infected h9 cells, or pbmc from hiv1-infected individuals with high plasma viral loads, were
washed twice with pbs by centrifugation at 400g for 10 min
and seeded in 96-well plates (nunc, rosklide, denmark) at
a density of 75 000 cells per well in 200 µl of rpmi, with
10% fcs. the viral production from chronically infected
cells was stimulated by addition of 10-20 nm recombinant
hiv-1 tat protein to the culture medium. the cells were
incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of neor
for 3 days at 37 °c. the inhibitory effect of neor on tatstimulated viral production was studied by measuring the rt
activity in the supernatants after incubation for 2 or 3 days.
inhibition of tat-dependent ltr-driven luciferase activity. neor’s ability to inhibit tat-tar interaction was determined in cell culture by an hiv-1 tat-dependent bioluminescence bioassay based on adenoviral vectors (32). briefly,
crude hiv-1 tat protein extract (25 µl) and adenoreporter
virus (ad-hivluc, 10-3 dilution), containing a tat-regulated
luciferase reporter gene, were added simultaneously to
cmagi cells, cultured in 96-well plates in medium with or
without neor. an adenovirus vector (ad-hiv∆-tarluc),
in which the tat responsive element (the tar region) was
deleted, was added instead of the ad-hivluc virus as a
control for tat-independent activation of the luciferase gene.
after overnight incubation at 37 °c in a humidified 5% co2
incubator, luciferin (boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in)
dissolved in 60 mm tris-acetate buffer (ph 7.5) was added
to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.3 mm.
after incubation for 30 min at 37 °c, the cells were lysed
with cell culture lysis reagent (cclb, promega), and the
luciferase activity in the cells extracts was measured by
adding 100 µl of luciferase assay reagent (promega) and
recording the emitted light with a lucyl microplate luminometer (anthos labtec instruments gmbh, salzburg,
austria).
the crude tat protein extract was prepared from 293/tat
cells, stably transfected with a tat expression vector as
described previously (32).

biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 51, 2001 15615
interaction of tat protein and neor with cd4, cxcr4,
and ccr5 receptors. measurement of the activity of the
 xxxg388xxx  and chemokine receptors cxcr4 and ccr5
on nonactivated or pha-, interleukin-2 (il-2)-, or tatactivated pbmc was performed by flow cytometry (facscan, immunocytometry systems, becton dickinson, san
jose, ca). cells were activated by incubation with pha or
tat for 24 h, or with il-2 for 2-3 days at 37 °c in the
presence or absence of neor. following the activation, 0.5
× 106 cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) containing 0.1% sodium azide (wash buffer)
and incubated for 30 min at 4 °c with anti-cxcr4 monoclonal antibody (mab), 12g5, conjugated to phycoerithrine
(pe), anti-ccr5 mab,  xxxd825xxx  (pharmingen, san diego, ca),
b-f5 anti-cd4 mab (immuno quality products, groningen,
netherlands), or leu-3a (becton dickinson), conjugated to
fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc), in the absence or presence
of stromal cell derived factor 1r (sdf-1r, r&d systems,
minneapolis, mn), and different concentrations of neor.
nonspecific fluorescence was assessed by using isotypematched controls. for double-staining experiments, the cells
were incubated with pe-conjugated anti-cd14 mab (pharmingen) and fitc-conjugated cxcr4 or ccr5 mabs.
following the incubation with the antibodies, the cells were
washed with ice-cold wash buffer and fixed in pbs containing 1% paraformaldehyde. for each sample, 10 000 events
were acquired. gated acquisition was assessed by a combination of gates based on either forward and side scatters or
cd14-pe staining. data were analyzed and processed using
cellquest software (becton dickinson).
viral binding assay. to measure neor’s ability to inhibit
viral binding to cells, hiv-1 viral particles were radioactively
labeled by endogenous reverse transcription (ert), without
detergent or amphipathic peptide-induced permeability of the
viral envelope, in order not to perturb the virions, according
to the method of zhang et al. (33) and as previously described
(34). briefly, 0.5 ml of hiv-1 particles (1.5-5 ng of p24)
was added to 0.5 ml of ert reaction mixture [final
concentrations of 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 150 mm nacl,
1 mm mgcl2, 50 µm  xxxd1148xxx , 50 µm dttp, 50 µm dctp,
and 50 µm  xxxd1837xxx , as well as 50 µci of [r-32p] xxxd1148xxx ]. after
incubation for 2 h at 37 °c, the reaction mixture was diluted
with pbs to 2 ml, and the viral particles were concentrated
to a final volume of 50 µl using a centricon ym-50
centrifugal concentrator (millipore), according to the manufacturer’s directions. this procedure was repeated four times
to remove unbound radiolabel. the viral particles were
incubated for 2 h at 37 °c with 200 000 mt2 or u937 cells
in 0.5 ml of rpmi with 10% fcs in the presence of various
concentrations of neor. following the incubation, the cells
were washed twice with pbs by centrifugation at 400g for
10 min. the pellets were resuspended in pbs and transferred
onto glass fiber filters (millipore). the filters were washed
twice with pbs, dried, and counted as described above.
pbmc proliferation assay. pbmc (100 000 cells per well)
were seeded in a 96-well plate (nunc) in 200 µl of rpmi
with 10% fcs, containing 1 µl of  xxxd2676xxx  beads (pharmingen), as well as 0-20 nm tat and 0-5 µm neor in
each well. after incubation for 2 days at 37 °c, 1 µci of
[3h]thymidine (amersham) was added to each well and the
cells were incubated for an additional 14 h. then the cells
were harvested on glass fiber filters (millipore). the filters

15616 biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 51, 2001
were washed several times with water and were counted as
described above.
cd8 expression on pbmc. pbmc were activated by
incubation with different concentrations of tat for 24 h at
37 °c in the presence or absence of neor. the cells were
stained with fitc-conjugated anti-cd8 mab (pharmingen).
following the incubation with the antibodies, the cells were
treated as described above and cd8 expression was analyzed
by facs. nonspecific fluorescence was assessed by using
an isotype-matched antibody control.
modeling of the complex between neor and tar rna.
several initial model structures of the complex of neor with
tar rna were constructed, based on the experimental
structure of tar rna in complex with arginine, as determined by nmr spectroscopy (pdb entry 1arj). thus, each
of the arginine side chains of neor was placed within the
binding cavity of tar rna like the arginine in the experimental complex. each of the structures was energy minimized using the discover module of msi (msi inc., san
diego, ca) and the cvff force field. the positions of the
tar rna atoms, except hydrogen, were fixed in these
computations. in addition, we constrained the distances
between the appropriate arginine nh2 groups and the
hydrogen bond acceptors, n7 and o6, of guanine 26. these
hydrogen bonds correspond to the ones formed by the
guanidino group of arginine in its complex with tar rna
(1arj). the structure of one of the complexes, in which the
arginine bound to ring i of neor interacts with guanine 26
of tar rna, was further optimized by several intermittent
dynamics and minimization stages. each dynamics stage
included 5000 steps of 1 fs each. each dynamics stage was
followed by an energy minimization stage requiring that the
maximum derivative be less than 0.001. in addition to the
process described above, neor was placed in the minor
groove of tar rna, like neomycin in the complex of tar

chemical characterization of  xxxd2161xxx -arginine
conjugate (neor). the major hplc peak of ∼90% purity,
proven by mass spectroscopy (malditof) to be m/z
1552.68, stands for the hexaarginine derivative of neomycin
b (calculated mass of 1552.1). the 1h nmr (400 mhz,
d2o) spectrum of neor (acetate salts) revealed the presence
of the characteristic groups of the arginine moieties at
chemical shifts (delta) of 3.59 (hr) and 3.21 ppm (hbeta) as well
as at 1.64 and 1.82 ppm (hgamma,delta). the characteristic neomycin
b proton signals were observed, in particular, the anomeric
hydrogen signals as doublets at 5.1, 5.3, and 5.73 ppm.
integration afforded a 1:6 ratio of antibiotic to arginine
components. a 13c nmr (100 609 mhz, 10% d2o, protondecoupled) spectrum of neor revealed carbon resonances
of the c-arginine amide moieties at 20.68, 26.85, 36.91, and
50.2 ppm as well as carbon resonances of the neomycin
moiety with the characteristic signals of the anomeric carbons
at 92.005, 95.01 (pyranoside), and 105.61 ppm (furanoside).
the spectrum also revealed a group of amide carbon
resonances at 178.09 ppm and a guanidinium carbon signal
at 154.56 ppm.

the tar rna concentration is 12 nm.

binding of neor to hiv tar rna in vitro. the ability
of neor to bind tar rna was studied by using a gel shift
technique as previously described (21, 28, 29). neor binding
to 32p-labeled tar rna was observed as electrophoretic
band shifts (figure 2). the conjugate displayed high affinity
for tar rna ( xxxg1128xxx  ∼ 130 nm). the  xxxg1128xxx  of the tar
rna-tat r52 peptide complex under the same conditions
is ∼50 nm (28). so far, neor exhibits the highest affinity
for tar rna compared to the other aac (28, 29).
fluorescence anisotropy is often used to measure dissociation constants of rna-ligand interactions (30, 31). it is
well-known that not only tat peptides bind tar rna with
high affinity, but the rev peptide does also (35, 36). using
the fluorescence anisotropy technique and revrh as the
fluorescent probe, we found straightforward competition of
neor and revrh for tar rna binding with a kd of 5.8
nm, indicating a high affinity of neor for tar rna
comparable to that of revrh (18.7 nm) and that of the
natural ligand tat49-57 (kd ) 6 nm). thus, the possibility
that neor could also bind to hiv-1 rre rna has been
investigated using a fluorescence anisotropy assay. preliminary results show that neor competes with revrh for
binding to rre iib with a kd of 18.1 nm, similar to that of
revrh (kd ) 14.4 nm) (figure 2 of the supporting
information). these preliminary results are not surprising
since neor mimics tat and, as already mentioned (33, 36),
tat also binds to hiv-1 rre rna.
cellular uptake of the fluorescently labeled conjugate
of neor. uptake of fluorescently labeled aac by live cells
of different origins and their cellular distribution were
described previously (28, 29). confocal microscopy of live
pbmc and rat hippocanpal neurons, incubated for 30 min
with the fluorescent derivative of neor (neor-fitc) at
0.5 µm, revealed that neor readily penetrates the cells and
accumulates in the nuclei (figure 3).
anti-hiv activity of neor. addition of neor during the
infection and thereafter (protocol 1; see experimental
procedures) inhibited a variety of syncytia-inducing (ttropic) laboratory and clinical hiv-1 isolates, including azt,
3tc, and uc781 resistant hiv strains, with ec50 values of
1.7-5.3 µm (table 1). similarly, neor inhibited hiv-1 jrfl and hiv-1 ba-l (non-syncytia-inducing laboratory
isolates) with ec50 values of 0.8 and 5 µm, when tested in
u937 and cmagi cells, respectively (table 1). the inhibitory effects of neor on hiv-1 clade c infection in mt2
cell, under different incubation protocols, are presented in
figure 4. when the infection of the cells was performed in

a the 50% effective concentration which inhibited hiv-1 replication was determined by reverse transcriptase or p24 antigen levels. the data are
the average of two independent experiments carried out in duplicate. b the 50% cytotoxic concentration in mt2 and pbmc was determined by a
tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay. c the 50% in vitro therapeutic index was calculated by dividing the cc50 by the average ec50. d in protocol
1, neor was present throughout the experiment. in protocol 3, neor was present during the first 2 h, and then washed. e wild-type virus. f hiv-1

the absence of neor (protocol 2), the ec50 values were
somewhat higher (figure 4) than in protocol 1. however,
the presence of neor only during the first 2 h of infection
(protocol 3) was sufficient for inhibition of the viral
proliferation.
the antiviral activity of neor against laboratory strain
hiv-1 2d and clade c clinical isolate in the presence of
azt was found to be additive to that of azt (data not
shown). the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (cc50) of neor
were 275 µm in mt2 cells and 500 µm in pbmc (table
1). thus, the 50% therapeutic index (ti50, which is the cc50/

ec50 ratio) of neor is 94 and 125 in mt2 cells and pbmc,
respectively (table 1).
effect of neor on viral binding to cells. the finding that
the presence of the neor only during the first 2 h of infection
was enough to inhibit virus production (figure 4) suggests
that neor may interfere with the binding of the virus to the
cells. to test if neor also inhibits hiv-1 binding to cells,
we used 32p-labeled (see experimental procedures) hiv-1
iiib virions and incubated them for 2 h with mt2 cells in
the presence or absence of different concentrations of neor
up to 16 µm (figure not shown). neor efficiently inhibited,

figure 4: inhibitory effect of neor on the replication of hiv-1
clade c infection in mt2 cells. mt2 cells were infected for 2 h at
37 °c in the absence or presence of 2-20 µm neor followed by
cell wash. approximately 5 × 104 infected cells were seeded per
well in a 96-well plate and were incubated for 4 days in the absence
or presence of 2-20 µm neor, until syncytia were observed
(>25% cpe). cell viability was measured by the tetrazolium-based
colorimetric method. the results that are shown are means (
standard deviation of triplicate experiments. (o) neor was present
during the infection step and after the cells were washed. (3) neor
was present only after the cell wash. (0) neor was present only
during the first 2 h, before the cells were washed.

in a dose-dependent manner, the binding of the labeled
virions to the cells; e.g., the level of viral binding to cells
was reduced by 75% in the presence of 4 µm neor, and
almost abolished in the presence of 8 µm neor.
interaction of neor with cd4, cxcr4, and ccr5
receptors. cd4 is the main receptor of hiv-1, while ccr5
and cxcr4 are the main coreceptors for entry of hiv-1
m-tropic and t-tropic viruses into the cells, respectively
(reviewed in refs 37 and 38). since neor inhibited hiv-1
binding to cells, we examined whether neor can interact
with these receptors, by testing its capacity to inhibit the
binding of monoclonal antibodies against them. while neor
did not inhibit the binding of b-f5 or leu-3a mab against
cd4 or the  xxxd825xxx  mab to ccr5, 2.5 and 5 µm neor caused
66 and 91% inhibition of 12g5 mab binding to cxcr4 in
pbmc, respectively, as determined by the median fluorescence intensities (figure 5a). while similar competition with
12g5 mab binding to cxcr4 was seen with sdf-1r, the
natural ligand of cxcr4, no inhibition at all of 12g5 mab
binding to cxcr4 was found in the presence of 10 µm
neomycin (data not shown).
effect of neor on extracellular tat activities. (1) competition of neor with hiv-1 tat for binding to cxcr4.
hiv-1 tat also binds to cxcr4 (9). as shown in figure
5b, tat inhibited binding of the neor-fitc conjugate to
pbmc, probably by competing with neor for binding to
cxcr4. similar results were obtained whether the cells were
first incubated for 24 h with pha or used immediately after
fractionation from whole blood (data not shown).
(2) inhibition of tat transactivation. it is known that
soluble tat protein is taken up by cells and is transported to
the nuclei, where it transactivates the transcription from the
hiv-1 long terminal repeat promoter (39). to test the
capacity of neor to inhibit tat enhancement of hiv-1
production in cell culture, we used h9 cells chronically
infected with hiv-1. as shown in figure 6, neor, in the

figure 5: (a) competition of neor and 12g5 mab binding to
cxcr4 on pbmc. cells were incubated with pe-conjugated
isotype control mab, pe-anti cxcr4-conjugated mab (12g5)
alone or in the presence of 2.5 or 5 µm neor for 30 min at 4 °c.
the cells were then washed twice with pbs and analyzed by flow
cytometry. the mean and median fluorescence intensities are shown
in the legend. (b) inhibition of entry of the neor-fitc conjugate
into pbmc by hiv-1 tat. pbmc were incubated with ∼0.5 µm
neor-fitc in the presence of 0, 200, or 400 nm hiv-1 tat for
30 min at 4 °c. the cells were then washed twice with pbs and
analyzed by flow cytometry. the mean and median fluorescence
intensities are shown in the legend.

absence of added extracellular tat, inhibited viral production,
with an ec50 value of ∼2.5 µm, suggesting that neor
inhibits the intracellular tat produced in the hiv-1-infected
cells. addition of extracellular tat significantly stimulated

figure 6: inhibitory effect of neor on tat-induced transactivation
of viral production by h9 cells chronically infected with hiv-1
and pbmc from an hiv-1-infected individual with a high viral
load. the cells were incubated in the absence (0) or presence (o)
of 15 nm tat and 0-2.5 µm neor. the level of viral production
was measured by reverse transcriptase activity in supernatants
during the third day of incubation. the results represent one of
two similar experiments, and the data that are shown are the means

hiv-1 production by the cells. however, 0.5 µm neor
abolished this enhanced production of hiv-1 induced by tat
(figure 6). similar results were obtained with pbmc from
an hiv-1-infected individual with a high plasma viral load
(more than 580 000 hiv rna copies/ml) (figure 6),
suggesting that neor targets the tat transactivation step in
the hiv life cycle and the extracellular tat upregulation of
hiv-1 viral entry coreceptor expression. to corroborate this
possibility, the direct inhibition of tat-tar interaction by
neor was examined by using a highly sensitive adenoviral
hiv ltr-mediated luciferase gene expression bioassay. the
assay system consists of two adenoreporter vectors, one of
which is responsive to hiv-1 tat protein activity (adhivluc), and the second of which is not (ad-hiv ∆-tarluc), by virtue of a deletion of the tar site within the hiv
ltr. in the absence of neor, addition of 25 µl of crude
tat protein extract to cmagi cells transfected with an hiv
ltr-driven luciferase reporter gene increased the amount
of emitted light from 1670 to 28 159 light units. in the
presence of neor (0-20 µm), the amount of emitted light
was reduced up to 80% with an ic50 of 10 µm. in contrast,
the light emitted by cmagi cells transfected with ad-hiv∆tarluc was not affected by the addition of tat and/or 20
µm neor (20 µm neor was not toxic to the cells).
(3) inhibition of tat upregulation of cxcr4 coreceptor
expression on lymphocytes and monocytes. incubation of
t-cells in the presence of tat protein was shown to
upregulate the expression of chemokine coreceptors of hiv
viral entry (12), as soon as 4-24 h after tat addition to the
cell culture medium (13, 14), and is sustained for 8 days
(12). we examined the effect of neor on the expression of
cxcr4 on different pbmc subsets following treatment of
the cells for 24 h with 20 nm tat. only a minor effect on
the proportion of the cells expressing cxcr4 was noted
when pbmc were cultured in the presence of 20 nm tat or
tat diluent buffer for 24 h. however, the median fluorescence
intensity, which reflects the number of membrane receptors
expressed per cell, was increased by 20 and 45% on the tattreated lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, respec-

expression upregulation on pbmc and monocytes. pbmc were
plated and treated with 20 nm tat (b) or tat diluent buffer
(untreated) (3) in the presence of 0-5 µm neor. after incubation
for 24 h, the cells were collected, washed to remove the extracellular
drugs, and analyzed for cxcr4 expression by flow cytometry. the
data represent averages of four independent experiments; the level
of surface cxcr4 expression is calculated as median fluorescence
intensity values, taken relative to the untreated control.

figure 8: effect of neor on tat-induced suppression of the
proliferative response of pbmc to cd3 activation. pbmc from
an hiv-negative donor were activated by incubation with  xxxd2676xxx 
beads and incubated with 0 (b), 7 (3), or 20 (9) nm tat for 24 h
in the presence of 0, 1, or 5 µm neor. the proliferative response
was measured by the level of [3h]thymidine incorporation into the
cells. the results shown are means ( standard deviation of triplicate
experiments.

tively (figure 7). this upregulation by tat was abolished
by 1 µm neor (figure 7).
(4) inhibition of pbmc proliferation suppression by tat.
tat protein suppresses lymphocyte proliferation (2). to study
the capacity of neor to inhibit this immunosuppressive effect
of tat, we activated pbmc of hiv sero-negative donors
with  xxxd2676xxx  ab and incubated the cells with 7 or 20 nm
tat. the addition of tat resulted in a significant reduction
in the extent of pbmc proliferation (∼50-60%), as determined by 3h thymidine incorporation (figure 8). as shown,
1 and 5 µm neor abolished the antiproliferative effect of
7 and 20 nm tat, respectively (figure 8).
(5) inhibition of induction of cd8 expression by tat.
one of the possible mechanisms of tat-induced immunosuppression is induction of cd8+ suppressor t-cells (40).
to investigate the ability of neor to inhibit this effect of
tat, we incubated nonactivated pbmc, obtained from six

15620 biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 51, 2001
hiv sero-negative donors, with 15 nm tat for 24 h at 37
°c in the presence or absence of various concentrations of
neor. hiv-1 tat caused in all six experiments an increase
in the range of 23-69% in the level of cd8 expression,
as determined by the median fluorescence intensities, in comparison to untreated controls. in all these experiments, 1 µm
neor inhibited significantly the tat-induced upregulation
of cd8 expression (78 ( 20.7% inhibition of the increase
in the median fluorescence intensities). a representative experiment is available upon request in the form of supporting
information (figure 3).
discussion
development of inhibitors against the hiv transcriptional
 xxxg515xxx , tat, is highly important and might even
be critical in the fight against aids. indeed, several tatmimetic peptide/peptoid compounds that target tar rna
and demonstrate a pronounced antiviral activity have recently
been described, such as a d-amino acid peptide derived from
the tat basic domain (41), cgp64222 (42), and aac (29).
it was also reported (29) that aac bind to tar rna with
high affinity, but not to a variety of short rna oligonucleotides and truncated tar rna sequences (in the micromolar
concentration range). an ∼10-fold excess of yeast rna
inhibits formation of the aac-tar complex, similar to
the effect of trna on tat-derived peptide binding to tar.
here we present a novel hiv-1 tat mimetic, a hexaarginine
derivative of  xxxd2161xxx  (neor) (43), that not only binds
tar and inhibits the binding of hiv-1 to cells but also
manifests potent inhibition of several detrimental extracellular
tat activities. the selection of  xxxd2161xxx  for the synthesis
of neor was based on the ability of  xxxd2161xxx  to bind
tar rna, although with a very low affinity (24), in contrast
to the nonactive aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin a and
gentamicin c. the synthesis, anti-hiv activities, and, in
particular, the inhibition of the extracellular activities of tat
by neor are presented.
competition of neor with tat functions. since neor is
a tat mimetic, we examined its ability to compete with
several tat functions, especially those dependent on the tat
basic domain. as we demonstrate here, neor (0.5 µm)
caused a 50% reduction in the level of enhanced production
of hiv-1 induced by tat in h9 t-cells chronically infected
with hiv-1 and of pbmc infected with hiv-1, indicating
that neor interferes with tat transactivation activity. neor
inhibition of tat-tar interaction-driven luciferase-reported
gene activity supports the notion that neor also interacts in
vivo with tar. unpublished preliminary results showing
that resistance by hiv-1 to neor involves mutations in the
tar region further strengthen this notion. the fact that
significantly higher concentrations of neor are needed in
vivo than in in vitro to inhibit tat-tar interactions is not
surprising, since neor may interact with other molecules,
such as a tat cofactor, lowering the number of “available”
neor molecules that may compete with tat for tar
binding. the capacity of tat to upregulate cxcr4 expression on lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages (12-14)
was abolished by 1 µm neor. a similar capacity to inhibit
cxcr4 upregulation induced by tat was recently reported
for a stilbene derivative (44), a compound that directly
binds tat, but does not bind tar rna. another tat activity,

litovchick et al.
the antiproliferative effect on cd3-activated pbmc (45),
was also abolished by 1-5 µm neor, as presented in this
report. tat has also been found to induce cd8+ suppressor
lymphocytes in vitro (46). the upregulation of cd8 expression on pbmc by tat, presented in this report, may be the
manifestation of this mechanism. importantly, neor (1 µm)
neutralized this activity of tat as well, like what has been
reported for anti-tat antibodies (46). these results suggest
competitive mechanisms of neor with tat-induced immunosuppression.
recently, it has been shown that extracellular hiv-1 tat
acts as a cxcr4 antagonist by binding to cxcr4 and at
concentrations of 0.5-1 µm inhibits cxcr4-dependent
hiv-1 infection (9, 47). this, together with our findings that
neor inhibits binding of mab against cxcr4 (figure 5a)
and that the extracellular hiv-1 tat inhibits neor-fitc
uptake by pbmc (figure 5b), suggests that both compete
for the same target, the hiv-1 coreceptor cxcr4. however,
the possibility of indirect interaction mediated by another
factor(s) cannot be excluded.
neor inhibits hiv-1 binding to cells. the presence of
neor only during the first 2 h of cell exposure to hiv was
sufficient to inhibit viral production. this raised the possibility that neor inhibits viral binding to cells and/or that
sufficient amounts of neor are readily taken into the cells,
which inhibit subsequent post-cell entry steps of the virus
life cycle. as shown here, both possibilities occur: neor
inhibits penetration into cells of radioactively labeled hiv
particles, and neor, which is taken readily into cell nuclei,
abolishes the enhancement of viral production in cells
chronically infected with hiv-1, induced by tat.
the mechanism of inhibition of t-tropic hiv-1 binding
to cells by neor could also be via blockade of the cxcr4
coreceptor. the inhibitory effect of neor on binding of mab
12g5 to cxcr4 supports this notion. a similar blockade
of the cxcr4 coreceptor were found for the triargininegentamicin conjugate (r3g) and the tetraarginine-kanamycin conjugate (r4k), but not for the tetra-gamma-guanidinobutyric
acid-kanamycin conjugate (gb4k) (48). these results are
in agreement with the finding that the tat-peptoid cgp64222
inhibits the hiv replicative cycle also through a selective
interaction with the hiv-1 coreceptor cxcr4 (42). the
interaction between hiv-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and the
cxcr4 coreceptor involves a highly conserved arginine
residue in hypervariable region 3 (v3 loop) of gp120 (49).
t-tropic hiv-1-derived v3 loop peptides directly bind to
cxcr4 and inhibit t-tropic hiv-1 interaction (50). moreover, the tat protein itself binds cxcr4 and even can block
at high concentrations entry of hiv into the cells (2, 47).
since neor is a tat mimetic, comprising several arginine
moieties, it may also compete with the gp120 v3 loop for
cxcr4 receptor binding and thus inhibit entry of hiv-1
into cells. although not shown here, recent results supporting
this possibility show that 7 µm neor inhibits >90% gp120mediated cell death. structural mimicking of the gp120 v3
loop by neor, where three arginine moieties of neor are
superimposed on arginines 8, 11, and 15 of the v3 loop of
gp120 (51, 52), can be easily achieved due to the flexibility
of neor (not shown).
neor, like r3g, r4k, and gb4k (48), amd3100 (53),
and cgp64222 (42), does not inhibit the binding of  xxxd825xxx 
mab against ccr5. however, neor and r3g inhibit hiv-1

figure 9: plausible structure of the tar-rna complex with neor. specifically, the arginine on ring i conjugated via the aliphatic
amine of  xxxd2161xxx  is positioned in the cavity formed by the bulge of tar rna. the surface of tar rna is colored white, except for
the phosphate groups, which are red. the neomycin core of neor is shown in green, and the arginine moieties are in yellow. the guanidino
group of the arginine on ring i interacts with the n7 and o6 atoms of guanine 26, whose surface is shown in magenta. the r-amino group
interacts with the o2p atoms of guanines 21 and 36 of tar rna. the structure of tar rna is based on the structure of the tar
rna-arginine complex (pdb entry 1arj). panel b is view after a ∼90° clockwise turn of panel a.

ba-l (a m-tropic viral isolate) with an ec50 values of 5
(table 1) and 29 µm, respectively (48), while r4k, gb4k,
and amd3100 do not (48). since tat also upregulates ccr5
expression (14), neor, being a tat mimetic, may abolish
this effect in a manner similar to that shown for cxcr4.
thus, inhibition of the hiv-1 ba-l replicative cycle by neor
may be either by competitive reaction with extracellular tat
or through postentry events, such as inhibition of hiv tat
transactivation. another possibility of viral binding inhibition
is through interaction of neor with the  xxxg388xxx .
however, neor does not inhibit the binding of b-f5 or leu3a mab against cd4 in whole blood or in pbmc, as was
also found for r3g (data not shown and ref 48).
molecular modeling of the neor-tar complex. neor
was designed as an hiv-1 tat mimetic. this, together with
(a) the interaction of neor with hiv-1 tar rna (shown
by the gel shift assay), (b) a kd of 5.8 nm (determined by
fluorescence anisotropy), (c) the ability of neor to inhibit
enhancement of hiv-1 production induced by tat, (d)
inhibition of tat-tar interaction (dependent bioluminescence activity assay), and (e) preliminary results showing
that resistance by hiv-1 to neor involves mutations in the
tar region, led us to study the possible modes of interaction
between the two molecules.
a model structure of the tar-neomycin complex based
on nmr spectroscopy was recently calculated (25). the
model suggests that neomycin binds in a pocket formed by
the minor grove of the lower stem and the uridine-rich bulge
of tar, which adopt a conformation different from that
known for tat-tar interactions (26, 27). thus, it was of

interest to test whether the conformation of tar adapted in
the tar-neomycin complex is adequate for binding the
neomycin-arginine conjugate. to this end, we constructed
a model structure with neor placed in the same binding
pocket as neomycin. energy minimization, however, produced an unlikely complex, in which most of the contacts
of the neor rings with the minor groove were lost. these
results suggest that either the neor molecule does not bind
in the minor groove of tar rna or a major conformation
change in the rna molecule is necessary for accommodation
of the modified ligand.
an alternative mode of binding of neor to tar rna is
through the arginine ends, imitating the tar-rna complex
with arginine, where the ligand binds in a cavity formed by
the bulge of the rna (26, 27). each of the six arginine
groups was placed in the arginine-binding cavity, and the
six resulting complexes were energy minimized as described
in experimental procedures. these computations converged
smoothly and produced plausible structures, all characterized
by the binding of one arginine group in the tar rna cavity
and by numerous interactions of the rest of the neor
molecule with the loop fragment of the rna.
one of the resultant structures is shown in figure 9. in
addition to the hydrogen bonds between the guanidino moiety
of the arginine side chain and the hydrogen bond acceptors,
o6 and n7, in guanine 26, for which the distance constraints
applied in the minimization called, one notes a strong
electrostatic interaction between the r-amino group (the free
amine group) of the same arginine with the phosphate groups
of guanine 21 and guanine 36. the rest of the neor molecule

15622 biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 51, 2001
spreads over the shallow “bowl” formed by the loop segment
of the rna such that the neomycin rings interact with the
rna bases, while the arginine groups, except the one placed
in the arginine-binding cavity, interact with the phosphate
moieties. the latter interactions are probably nonspecific
because in an aqueous solution the phosphate groups as well
as the guanidino groups are likely to be hydrated. interestingly, the interactions of the r-amino group with two
phosphate groups and the general position of the neomycin
rings on the surface of the tar rna molecule are similar
in all six complexes formed when one of the arginine side
chains is placed in the tar rna arginine-binding cavity.
the accuracy of our computations is limited; hence, we
cannot determine whether the binding in one complex is
stronger than that in another one. nevertheless, the modeling
study provided a few important results, which were not
foreseen and which are supported by the experimental results.
(a) the possibility of binding neor in the minor groove
of tar rna, analogous to the binding of  xxxd2161xxx  (25),
was discarded.
(b) neor binds to tar rna in a manner analogous to
the binding of the arginine moiety of the tat peptide to tar
rna. this result complies with the experimental results. so
far, arginine residues of aminoglycoside were properly
recognized by tar rna (28, 29). the linker between the
“core” (e.g.,  xxxd2161xxx ) and the “headgroup” (guanidino
group) is most important for rna binding.
(c) the strong interaction between the r-amino of the
arginine moiety of neor and the tar rna phosphate group
is a modeling prediction, which is experimentally supported
(28, 29). thus, the affinity of gb4k, lacking an r-amino
acid group in the linker, for tar rna was very low
compared to that of the tetraarginine derivative, r4k (28,
29). also, gb4k anti-hiv activity in cell culture (48) and
in equine infectious anemia virus (eiav) in equine dermal
fibroblasts (ed) was very low (29). thus, all the above may
explain the very low anti-hiv-1 activities and affinity of
gb4k and other guandino derivatives for hiv-1 tar rna
reported in ref 28 and of other guanidino derivatives of
aminoglycosides for hiv-1 rre rna (54, 55).
(d) the binding of neor to tar rna is predicted by
the modeling study to be a combination of specific binding
of one arginine moiety with the bulge of tar rna in
addition to nonspecific interactions between the rest of neor
and the loop segment of tar rna. this modeling prediction is supported by our recent studies (29). our footprinting
analysis suggested that gb4k-induced conformational changes
in the loop region make this site more accessible for rnase
a cleavage. nevertheless, gb4k cannot protect the major
site, the bulge, or its conjunction to the upper and lower stem
from  xxxg1963xxx  cleavage in contrast to tat peptide r52 and
aac (29).
(e) moreover, the model structure suggests that, at a given
time, only one of the six arginine group of neor is bound
to the major groove. the finding that the monoarginine
derivative of neamine binds efficiently to tar rna with
an ic50 of 600 nm (56) also supports our modeling study.
interestingly, in a theoretical study of the tat46-58-tar
complex, seewald et al. (57) present an interaction between
arg52 and the bulge of tar and between arg53 and two
adjacent phosphates, p21 and p22. hence, both our model
and the tat46-58-tar model identify two specific contacts

litovchick et al.
in the vicinity of the bulge. however, in our model, both
contacts originate from the same arginine (via the guanidino
group and the r-amino group), whereas in the tat46-58tar model, two adjacent arginines are involved. this
similarity can explain the anti-hiv and tat antagonist
activities of neor.
conclusion. the rapid emergence of resistant hiv mutations represents a formidable challenge to the development
of anti-hiv drugs. one way of overcoming or diminishing
this severe problem is the development of a compound that
can interact with several viral targets, and which may be an
effective inhibitor of several stages of viral replication, since
resistance to multitarget inhibitors would necessitate multiple
mutations.
hiv-1 tat protein plays one of the central roles in aids
pathogenesis, due to its principle function in hiv-1 transcription and multiple involvement in hiv progression and
immunosuppression. therefore, the discovery of novel hiv
tat antagonists is not just one more strategy in anti-hiv
pharmacological intervention, but may be highly important
in view of the inability of existing therapies to eradicate hiv
infection. here we show for the first time the novel hiv-1
tat mimetic antagonist neor, which in addition to inhibiting
tat transactivation and other hiv tat extracellular detrimental functions, inhibits hiv binding to cells. our data
suggest that neor interferes with tat transactivation by
interacting with tar rna, and a plausible structure of the
complex of tar rna with neor is described. in addition,
we demonstrate the capacity of neor to inhibit several
extracellular tat activities, partially by competing with tat
for the binding to cxcr4. finally, we demonstrate the
capacity of neor to inhibit hiv-1 infection by interfering
with hiv binding to cells, partially by binding with one of
the main hiv-1 cellular coreceptors, cxcr4. although it
is not shown here, it is worth mentioning that neor is not
toxic to mice given intravenously two single doses of 25
mg/kg of body weight over the course of 2 h (unpublished
data).
we believe that neor, by its multitarget hiv-1 inhibitor
nature, may be an attractive lead for the development of
compounds that may help circumvent or reduce this immense
obstacle in hiv-1 therapy.
