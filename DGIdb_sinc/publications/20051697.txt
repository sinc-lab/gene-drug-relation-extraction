abstract
background: blockade of ␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx  (ampa)-type glutamate receptors is
a promising pharmacological strategy in the treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases. the aim of the study is to elucidate if there are direct interactions of riluzole and phenobarbital with ampa-type receptor channels and to determine the molecular pharmacological mechanisms. methods: the patch-clamp technique was used combining an
ultrafast solution exchange system to investigate the interaction of riluzole and phenobarbital with recombinant
ampa-type  xxxg981xxx  channels (homomeric
glur2flipgq or nondesensitizing glur2l504y). results: a
dose-dependent decrease in the relative peak current amplitude (ramp) and the relative area-under-the-current curve
(rauc) were found after preincubation with 0.1 mmol/l or
higher concentrations of riluzole. furthermore, in coapplication experiments with glur2l504y, the application of 1 or

3 mmol/l riluzole showed a decrease in the current decay
time constant, and a reopening current was observed at
3 mmol/l riluzole. phenobarbital blocks  xxxg981xxx 
channels dose-dependently in the coapplication experiments, and reopening currents after removing glutamate
and blocker were observed. a slight block effect after preincubation should indicate an additional competitive block effect. conclusion: riluzole and phenobarbital modulate
ampa-type receptor channels separately, which could be
both characterized as a combination of open-channel block
and competitive-block mechanism.

introduction

chronic excitotoxicity is one pathogenic pathway for
chronic neurodegenerative diseases, like amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (als), leading to neuronal degeneration
by overstimulation of glutamate receptors. glutamate is
the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system but is also toxic under certain pathological
conditions [1]. its main targets are ionotropic ␣-amino3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx  (ampa),

materials and methods
transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured
in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium, supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin
at 37 ° c in a 5% co2/95% air incubator. cells were suspended in a
buffer used for transfection (in mmol/l: 50 k 2hpo4, 20 k acetate,
ph 7.35).  xxxd2534xxx  was added to a final concentration of 25 mmol/l.
for transient transfection, cdna of ampa-type receptor channels, glur2flipgq or nondesensitizing glur2l504y [15–17], subcloned into expression vectors, were added to the suspension (25
␮g/ml). a reporter cdna encoding green fluorescent protein (10
␮g/ml) was added for identification of transfected cells. for transfection an electroporation device by equibio (ashford, uk) was
used. electroporation at room temperature was performed instantly after the addition of cells to the dna in a cuvette at 250 v,
750 ␮f and 329 ⍀, resulting in a pulse time of 18–21 ms. transfected cells were replated on glass coverslips (coated with poly-llysine) in a culture medium and incubated for at least 15 h.
patch-clamp measurements were performed on excised outside-out patches or small cells lifted from the bottom for rapid
application experiments using standard methods [18]. patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubes in two stages with
a horizontal dmz pipette puller (zeitz instruments, augsburg,
germany). pipette series resistance was 7–10 m⍀ when filled with
intracellular solution containing (in mmol/l): 140 kcl, 11 egta,
10 hepes, 10 glucose and 2 mgcl2. the osmolarity was adjusted
to 340 mosm/l with mannitol. cells were perfused with an extracellular solution containing (in mmol/l): 162 nacl, 5.3 kcl, 2
cacl2, 0.67 nah2po4, 0.22 kh2po4, 15 hepes and 5.6 glucose.
the ph of both solutions was adjusted to 7.3. sodium-l-glutamate
(monohydrate) was obtained from merck (new jersey, usa).
riluzole (kindly provided by rhône-poulenc, france) was solved
in dimethylsulfoxide (50 mmol/l) and stored as stock solution in
adequate amounts. phenobarbital was obtained from sigma (munich, germany). the final test solutions were freshly prepared for
each experiment.
data were recorded with an axopatch 200b patch-clamp amplifier (axon instruments, union city, calif., usa). membrane
currents were sampled at 20 khz using a digidata 1200 interface
and the pclamp6 software suit on a pc (axon instruments).
data were filtered at 5 khz for further analysis. the simplex algorithm was used to fit exponentials to averaged current traces.
the holding potential was kept at –40 mv. for statistical analysis
the one-way anova and independent student’s two-tailed t test
were used. differences were considered significant at the p ! 0.05
level. all data were given as means 8 sem (with number of experiment).
a piezo-driven ultrafast perfusion system was used for application of the neurotransmitter glutamate with or without test
drugs to excised outside-out membrane patches or small cells, as
previously described [19]. in that way, the application and removal of the agonist/test compound were performed at a rate of 80 ␮s
and 0.5 ms [20–22]. depending on the type of experiment, a single-outlet application pipette or a pulled theta glass pipette was
used for the generation of laminar-flow filaments of test solutions
surrounded by laminar-flow background solutions. it took around
10 s to completely exchange the background solution. the interval
between successive glutamate pulses was 30 s to minimize effects
due to rundown of glutamate-activated currents. for quantitative

n-methyl-d- xxxd233xxx  (nmda) and kainate-type
 xxxg981xxx  channels. among them, ampa receptors are the most important glutamate receptors to
mediate fast excitatory transmission.
different authors demonstrated that motor neurons in
a culture are particularly susceptible to an overstimulation of  xxxg981xxx  agonists [2, 3]. intrathecal or intraspinal administration of  xxxg981xxx  agonists has
been shown to induce motor neuron degeneration in animals, whereas nmda receptor agonists failed to damage
spinal motor neurons [4]. in organotypic rat spinal cord
cultures, motor neurons were shown to be vulnerable to
ampa-receptor-mediated excitotoxicity [5]. ca2+ influx
through ca2+-permeable ampa receptors was crucial
in triggering motor neuron death [6, 7]. application of
 xxxg981xxx  agonists resulted in selective motor neuron loss, which could be prevented by antagonists of
ampa receptors [5, 8]. for that reason, antagonizing glutamatergic neurotransmission by a blockade of ampatype glutamate receptors is a promising pharmacological
strategy in the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative
diseases. until now, riluzole is the only drug which has
proven to be effective against disease progression in als
patients [9]. it has got antiglutamatergic properties
(amongst others inhibition of glutamate release and of
glutamate receptors) [10–12]. phenobarbital is a traditional barbiturate which has been widely used for sedation, anesthesia and as an antiepileptic drug. it has been
reported that barbiturates (thiopental) attenuate nmdaand ampa-mediated glutamate excitotoxicity [13]. in a
study [14], phenobarbital blocked the kainic-acid-induced deficits in acquisition learning.
we performed the patch-clamp technique in combination with an ultrafast solution exchange system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of interaction of
riluzole and phenobarbital with recombinant ampatype  xxxg981xxx  channels. additionally, a nondesensitizing ampa-type receptor channel, glur2l504y,
was used to identify interactions with the receptor channel in the liganded state that otherwise would be masked
by current decay due to receptor desensitization [15–17].
for experiments with the desensitizing ampa-type receptors, the subtype glur2flipgq was used because this
incompletely desensitizing and ca2+-permeable subtype
should be most relevant to the induction of excitotoxic
cell death. it was found that both drugs modulate the
ampa receptors in a combination of open-channel block
and competitive-block mechanisms, but riluzole has a
mainly competitive-block mechanism while phenobarbital has a mainly open-channel block mechanism.

results

to analyze the mechanisms of functional interaction
of the tested compounds with ampa-type receptor channels, two protocols of dose dependency experiments were
used: the coapplication of agonist (10 mmol/l glutamate)
and test compounds (with increasing concentrations)
and the preincubation of ampa-type receptor channels
with increasing concentration of test compounds before
the application of agonist and test compounds.

cell transfected with glur2l504y cdna. fast application of glutamate elicited nondesensitizing membrane
currents that decayed after cessation of application due to
deactivation. in case of coapplication of riluzole, the current decayed during the application phase with a rate that
was dependent on the concentration of riluzole. the effects were completely reversible. data from 9 different experiments are shown in figure 1b, ruling out a significant
dose-dependent decrease in the relative peak current amplitude (ramp). the ramp was 0.98 (0.98 8 0.01, n = 9),
1.01 (1.02 8 0.02, n = 7) and 1.00 (1.01 8 0.02, n = 4),
when compared to the respective values with 10 mmol/l
glutamate application before and after trains of coapplication, and the relative time to peak (rttp) was 0.98 (0.95
8 0.04), 0.95 (0.96 8 0.03) and 1.00 (1.02 8 0.04), respectively, none with a significant difference (pramp =
0.15, prttp = 0.44).
the relative area-under-the-current curve (rauc) after coapplication of 0.1, 1 and 3 mmol/l riluzole with 10
mmol/l glutamate was 0.99 (0.98 8 0.01, n = 9), 0.87 (0.84

evaluation, 4–12 current traces for each experiment were averaged. application protocols were adapted to the respective experiments. generally, controls with pulses of saturating agonist
concentration in the absence of blocker were made before and after trains of pulses with agonist and blocker to derive control data
to normalize the current responses.

(0.51 8 0.02), respectively (p ! 0.001). when 10 mmol/l
glutamate and 1 or 3 mmol/l riluzole were coapplied, the
time course of current decay could be best fitted with a
biexponential function. the fast time constant, ␶b1, decreased from 11.46 (11.06 8 0.87) ms to 7.65 (7.54 8 0.30)
ms (n = 4, p = 0.02), the slow time constant, ␶b2, decreased
from 101.01 (103.32 8 4.84) ms to 69.61 (66.43 8 7.76)
ms (p = 0.003). when 3 mmol/l riluzole was coapplied, a
reopening current with ramp (measured from the current level at the end of the application phase and given as
percentage to the peak current amplitude during application) of 8% (10 8 2%) was also observed. riluzole blocks
the glur2l504y receptor channels dose-dependently in
the high concentration range. the decrease in the current
decay time constants during application and the reopening current phenomenon point to an open-channelblock-like mechanism of action.

to test if there was a block in the case of pre-equilibration of ampa-type receptor channels with riluzole, we
preincubated the patches for 30 s with increasing concentrations of riluzole before applying 10 mmol/l glutamate
together with the corresponding concentration of riluzole. in figure 2a averaged original current traces were
obtained before and after preincubation of an outside-out
patch containing glur2l504y homomeric receptor channels with 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mmol/l riluzole, respectively. the data from 7 different experiments are shown
in figure 2c. the ramp values were 0.98 (0.99 8 0.01,
n = 7), 0.98 (1.00 8 0.02, n = 7), 0.93 (0.92 8 0.02, n = 5)

inhibitory concentration, ic50 = 0.60 mmol/l), with significance for the effects of 0.1 mmol/l (p = 0.04) and
1 mmol/l riluzole (p ! 0.001). the rauc was 0.98 (0.99 8

coapplication experiments were performed with 10
mmol/l glutamate and different concentrations of phenobarbital (1, 10, 30 mmol/l; fig. 3a). the data from 8 different experiments are shown in figure 3b and c. after coapplication of 10 mmol/l glutamate and 1, 10 or 30 mmol/l
phenobarbital on homomeric glur2l504y ampa-type
receptor channels, the ramp (fig. 3a, b) was 0.99 (0.98 8

respectively. both parameters decreased significantly
(p ! 0.001) with increasing concentration of phenobarbital. the rcdes (fig. 3a, c) decreased to 0.91 (0.93 8 0.02),
0.76 (0.79 8 0.03) and 0.56 (0.59 8 0.04), respectively
(p ! 0.001). in case of coapplication of 10 mmol/l glutamate and 10 or 30 mmol/l phenobarbital, the time course
of current decay was best fit with a biexponential function ␶b1, the faster time constant, and ␶b2, the slower one.

effect upon preincubation is much stronger at the same
concentration. this indicates a competitive block effect.
the experiments were repeated with desensitizing
glur2flipgq receptor channels. the currents of figure
2b were obtained from one patch containing glur2flipgq
channels. figure 2d shows the evaluation of the results
from 5 independent experiments. in the preincubation
experiments, the ramps (fig. 2b, d) of 10 mmol/l glutamate with 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 mmol/l riluzole were 0.67 (0.68
8 0.03, n = 5), 0.66 (0.65 8 0.03, n = 5), 0.48 (0.44 8 0.07,
n = 4) and 0.22 (0.20 8 0.02, n = 3), respectively (ic50 =

0.66 (0.65 8 0.04), 0.40 (0.38 8 0.06) and 0.32 (0.28 8
0.05), both with a significant difference (p ! 0.001). after
coapplication of 10 mmol/l glutamate and riluzole, the
ramp and rauc were not significantly changed (data not
shown). thus, there were block effects of riluzole on
glur2flipgq that were shown to be more pronounced in
preincubation experiments.

or 62.74 ms (56.12 8 6.75 ms), in case of coapplication of
10 or 30 mmol/l phenobarbital without significant differences (p = 0.47 for ␶b1 and p = 0.90 for ␶b2). after cessation
of coapplication, a reopening current occurred with a relative peak rp2 (normalized to the peak current amplitude
during application) increasing from 15 to 27% when 10 or
30 mmol/l phenobarbital were applied. the rttp (fig. 3a,
b) was 1.01 (1.03 8 0.06), 0.99 (0.98 8 0.03) or 0.98 (0.98
8 0.01), respectively, with no significant difference (p =
0.76). thus, ramp, rauc and rcdes were obviously
changed parameters upon coapplication of phenobarbital. the reopening current after cessation of application
of glutamate and phenobarbital again points towards an
open-channel-block-like mechanism.
in the preincubation experiments, the ramp of 10
mmol/l glutamate with 1 and 10 mmol/l phenobarbital
was 0.96 (0.94 8 0.03, n = 5) and 0.79 (0.77 8 0.05, n =

the increasing concentration of phenobarbital. the ramp
was 0.91 8 0.01 after application of 10 mmol/l phenobarbital in coapplication experiments; in preincubation experiments, it decreased significantly more to 0.77 8 0.05
(p = 0.02). this block effect should indicate an additional
competitive block.
as shown in figure 4, the experiments were repeated
with glur2flipgq receptor channels. after coapplication of 10 mmol/l glutamate and 1, 3, 10 and 30 mmol/l
phenobarbital, the ramp was 0.95 (0.99 8 0.06, n = 6)
and 0.74 (0.75 8 0.04, n = 6), 0.61 (0.60 8 0.02, n = 4)

discussion

riluzole
our study shows that riluzole blocks ampa receptors
in a dose-dependent manner, showing two mechanisms
of action: competitive block and an open-channel-blocklike effect. in recombinant human glur2flipgq receptors, the effect of riluzole was significant for the parameters rauc and ramp which were decreased only when
the membrane patches were preincubated with riluzole.
when membrane patches containing nondesensitizing
glur2l504y receptor channels were preincubated with
riluzole, again the ramp and rauc were both reduced in
a dose-dependent manner. this is characteristic of a
competitive-block mechanism. in the coapplication experiments with glur2l504y receptors, riluzole showed
a block effect at concentrations 61 mmol/l accompanied
by a dose-dependent increase in the rate of current decay
[23]. the reopening currents after the coapplication of
glutamate with 3 mmol/l riluzole could be explained by
an open-channel block mechanism with fast unblocking
after cessation of the application of riluzole and glutamate. due to deactivation after cessation of agonist application, the current decays with a time constant in the
range of 10 ms. thus, rebound currents can be observed
only in case of fast solution exchange. on the other hand,
the fast time course of the development of the reopening
current points to a high backward rate of the potential
open-channel block in the range of 100 s–1 (according to
a time constant onset of around 10 ms).
recently, a block effect of riluzole on ampa-type receptor channels has been reported. a reduction of kainate-induced currents in spinal motor neurons in the presence of riluzole with an ic50 value of 1.54 ␮mol was described [11] but experiments with rat cortical neurons in
a primary culture revealed that riluzole decreased kain60

pharmacology 2010;85:54–62

ate-induced currents dose-dependently with an ic50 of
101 ␮mol [12]. from another study, it was reported that
riluzole inhibits kainic-acid-evoked responses in oocytes
expressing ampa receptors with an ic50 of 167 ␮mol [24].
the latter two studies were more comparable to our results. in our experiments with glur2flipgq receptor
channels, after preincubation with the lowest concentration of riluzole tested (0.1 mmol/l), the ramp and rauc
were 0.68 and 0.72, respectively. in experiments with
glur2l504y, a significant reduction of the rauc was
observed when patches were preincubated with 60.1
mmol/l riluzole. the difference might arise from the different receptor subtypes and agonists which were used in
these studies. because riluzole reduced the kainate-induced currents in spinal motor neurons and in rat cortical
neurons without changing the agonist half-maximal effective concentration, it was presumed that riluzole blocks
ampa-type receptors in a noncompetitive manner [11,
12]. on the other hand, from one of the two experimental
studies, it was reported that riluzole reduced the probability of kainate-activated ionic channels to dwell in the open
state with unchanged kinetic rate constants of desensitization and resensitization; the block effect did not display
any voltage dependence [12]. furthermore, if riluzole had
only a non-competitive-block effect, we would expect a
stronger effect after coapplication compared to preincubation experiments. in our experiments with both
glur2flipgq and glur2l504y receptors, the block effects were more efficient after preincubation. this points
to a more pronounced competitive-block effect of riluzole
compared to the mild non-competitive-block effect.
riluzole has been the first compound that showed a
therapeutic effect in the treatment of als [9]. a neuroprotective effect has been shown in vivo and in vitro.
many mechanisms of action have been suggested: antagonism of glutamatergic neurotransmission by means of
an inhibition of glutamate release, attenuation of excitatory amino acid receptor activation and a decrease in the
excitability of the postsynaptic cell membrane [10, 25],
e.g. shown by an inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium
channels [26], an interaction with potassium channels
[27], a decrease in kainate-induced currents in cortical
neurons [12], modulation of small- and large-conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels [28] and potentiation of
postsynaptic ␥- xxxd2177xxx  responses [29–31]. its
effect may be multifactorial. among different interactions, the influence on glutamatergic action is currently
favored as explanation of neuroprotection, in which the
direct effect on ampa-type receptor channels may also
be a factor. the combination of low-affinity competitivejin /schlesinger /song /dengler /krampfl

3, 10 and 30 mmol/l phenobarbital with 10 mmol/l glutamate, the time constant of current decay ␶b was 6.56 (6.47
8 0.23), 6.31 (6.36 8 0.40), 4.56 (4.38 8 0.19) and 4.30
(4.24 8 0.15) ms, respectively (p ! 0.001). in preincubation experiments, there was an additional effect on ramp
and rauc. after incubation with 1, 3, 10 and 30 mmol/l
phenobarbital, the ramp was 0.69 (0.72 8 0.04, n = 6),
0.53 (0.56 8 0.06, n = 5), 0.36 (0.34 8 0.02, n = 4) and
0.26 (0.29 8 0.03, n = 4), respectively (p ! 0.001). the
rauc was 0.59 (0.64 8 0.07), 0.49 (0.49 8 0.08), 0.29
(0.28 8 0.01) and 0.28 (0.27 8 0.04), respectively, both
with a significant difference (p = 0.01).

phenobarbital
our study confirms that phenobarbital acts on ampa
receptors in a dose-dependent manner, showing two action mechanisms: an open-channel-block-like action and
a competitive block. in the coapplication experiments
with glur2l504y receptors, a block effect was observed
with increasing concentrations of phenobarbital, which
was characterized by a reduced current amplitude of the
steady-state current amplitude and the rauc, a decrease
in ramp and a dose-dependent increasing reopeningcurrent amplitude. this might be explained by a mechanism like the open-channel block. the observation of a
biexponential current decay upon coapplication of phenobarbital with the agonist glutamate points – in a mechanistic view – to at least two different blocked states accessed from liganded or even open states of l504y  xxxg981xxx  channels. additionally, the block effect of
phenobarbital was more effective in preincubation experiments than that in coapplication experiments. both the
ramp and the rauc were reduced in a dose-dependent
manner. in human glur2flipgq receptors, the effect of
phenobarbital was also observed in coapplication experiments, and the block effect was more obvious after preincubation with phenobarbital. these results reveal an
additional competitive block effect.
the block effect of barbiturates on ampa-type receptor channels has been reported, while there is no consistent hypothesis on the molecular mechanism. a study in
cultured cortical neurons revealed that the inhibition of
ampa-type receptor channels by pentobarbital is use dependent, an effect interpreted as being consistent with an
open-channel block mechanism [32]. however, another
study suggests that pentobarbital does not act as an openchannel blocker of ampa-type receptor channels [33].
rather, the sensitivity, use dependence and trapping of inhibition by pentobarbital are determined by ampa-type
receptor channel desensitization [33]. from our results,
the block mechanism of phenobarbital on ampa-type receptor channels seems to be a combination of an openchannel block and an additional competitive-block effect.
as a barbiturate-type drug, phenobarbital has widely been
used for its sedative, anesthetic and anticonvulsant properties. it was reported that pretreatment with phenobarbital results in behavioral neuroprotection against kainicacid-induced neurotoxicity in animal models of toxic
interaction of riluzole and phenobarbital
with ampa-type glutamate receptors

brain damage. daily phenobarbital treatment (20 mg/kg
i.p.) initiated 45 min prior to the kainic acid injection
blocked the kainic-acid-induced deficits in acquisition
learning [14]. in our experiments, phenobarbital could
block ampa-type receptor channels, but at very high concentrations (beyond clinically reached plasma levels). the
concentration range for the block effect is accordant with
the results of pentobarbital application on ampa receptors from  xxxg953xxx  null allele (–/–) neurons [34]. it was reported that recombinant receptors which lack the  xxxg953xxx 
subunit [35] or its q/r-edited site [36] demonstrate a 5- to
10-fold reduced sensitivity to pentobarbital. in our experiments, we used the glur2l504y and glur2flipgq, both
calcium-permeable subtypes, which could be the reason
for the low sensitivity to phenobarbital. normally, the anticonvulsant therapeutic serum level of phenobarbital is
10–40 ␮g/ml [37]. further study will be needed if there is
an interaction on ampa-type receptors with edited  xxxg953xxx 
subunits in this concentration range.
in conclusion, the two compounds tested acted as
blockers on ampa-type receptor channels. riluzole modulates dose-dependently the ampa receptors in a mainly
competitive-block manner and shows an additional openchannel block mechanism. phenobarbital interacts with
the ampa receptors in a relatively high concentration
range, in a dose-dependent manner, via a combination of
open-channel block and a mild competitive block. with
respect to the missing success of the translation of preclinical neuroprotection to patients suffering from progressive neurodegenerative diseases like als achieved by
a great variety of compounds during the last decade, our
study should provide data on the basic pharmacological
level leading to a better understanding of action profiles
of compounds that combine clinical tolerance with neuroprotective effects regarding glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. especially the profile of a combination of low-affinity competitive and noncompetitive antagonists with
ampa-type receptors, as observed for riluzole and phenobarbital, could be derived as a possible strategy.
