antibodies directed against the heavy chain interfere with  xxxg752xxx  activation (6, 9)
the factor xi heavy chain is composed of four 90 –91-amino
acid repeats called apple domains (designated a1–a4), with a1
located at the amino terminus of the molecule (10). these
domains have been implicated in binding interactions with
molecules and surfaces involved in blood coagulation (9, 11–
13). previously, we prepared recombinant chimeric factor xi
molecules in which individual apple domains were replaced
with the corresponding domain from the related plasma protease prekallikrein (pk)1 (9). pk, the zymogen of the kininogenase plasma kallikrein, shares 58% amino acid homology and
similar domain structure with factor xi (14, 15). the two proteases are functionally distinct, however, with pk being a poor
activator of  xxxg752xxx  (2, 9). a chimeric molecule in which the
factor xi a3 domain is replaced with that of pk ( xxxg742xxx /pka3) is
a poor activator of  xxxg752xxx , whereas chimeras with pk substitutions for a1, a2, or a4 activate  xxxg752xxx  normally. these
data demonstrate that the a3 domain is required for interactions with  xxxg752xxx  (9). in this report, we describe mapping
studies of the factor xi a3 domain that identify amino acids at
the n and c termini of the domain required for normal activation of  xxxg752xxx .
experimental procedures

materials and reagents

 xxxg742xxx  is the zymogen of a plasma serine
protease that contributes to blood coagulation by proteolytically activating  xxxg752xxx  in a calcium-dependent manner (1–3).
human factor xi is a 160-kda dimeric glycoprotein consisting
of two identical 80-kda polypeptides connected by a single
disulfide bond (4, 5). conversion of zymogen factor xi to the
active form, factor xia, is accomplished by a single cleavage in
each polypeptide, resulting in a pair of 35-kda c-terminal light
chains with homology to the pancreatic digestive enzyme trypsin and two 45-kda n-terminal heavy chains (4, 6). although
catalytic activity resides in the light chains, it is clear from
several lines of evidence that the heavy chain is required for
optimal activation of  xxxg752xxx . the capacity of isolated factor
xia light chain to activate  xxxg752xxx  is ,1% that of the intact
molecule, even though both the light chain and whole molecule
cleave a chromogenic substrate similarly (6 – 8). in addition,

activated  xxxg742xxx  (factor xia) proteolytically cleaves its substrate,  xxxg752xxx , in an interaction requiring the factor xi a3 domain (sun, y., and
gailani, d. (1996) j. biol. chem. 271, 29023–29028). to
identify key amino acids involved in  xxxg752xxx  activation, recombinant factor xia proteins containing alanine substitutions for wild-type sequence were expressed in 293 fibroblasts and tested in a plasma clotting
assay. substitutions for ile183–val191 and ser195–ile197 at
the n terminus and for ser258–ser264 at the c terminus of
the a3 domain markedly decreased factor xi coagulant
activity. the plasma protease prekallikrein is structurally homologous to factor xi, but activated  xxxg752xxx 
poorly. a chimeric factor xia molecule with the a3 domain replaced with a3 from prekallikrein ( xxxg742xxx /pka3)
activated  xxxg752xxx  with a km 35-fold greater than that of
wild-type factor xi.  xxxg742xxx /pka3 was used as a template for
a series of proteins in which prekallikrein a3 sequence
was replaced with factor xi sequence to restore factor
ix activation. clotting and kinetics studies using these
chimeras confirmed the results obtained with alanine
mutants. amino acids between ile183 and val191 are necessary for proper  xxxg752xxx  activation, but additional
sequence between ser195 and ile197 or between phe260
and ser265 is required for complete restoration of
activation.

unfractionated heparin was from pharmacia hepar, inc. (franklin,

preparation of factor xi and  xxxg742xxx /pka3 chimeric expression
constructs and transfection of 293 cells
mutations to produce alanine substitutions were introduced into the
wild-type factor xi cdna in pbluescript using a chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit. proper introduction of mutations was confirmed by dna sequencing. each mutant contains two to four alanine
substitutions in adjacent amino acids (see fig. 1). factor xi cdnas
were introduced into a mammalian expression vector containing the
cytomegalovirus promoter (pjvcmv) (9). 293 fibroblasts (5 3 106) were
transfected with 40 mg of factor xi cdna/pjvcmv and 2 mg of prsvneo, which contains a gene conferring neomycin resistance. transfection was by electroporation using an electrocell manipulator 600 (btx,
inc., san diego, ca). transfected cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium with 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then
switched to the same medium containing the neomycin analog  xxxg418xxx 
(500 mg/ml). the medium was exchanged every 48 h for 14 days. g418resistant clones were tested for protein expression by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. clones expressing high levels of protein were
expanded in 175-cm2 culture flasks. when cells reached .50% confluence, the medium was replaced with 75 ml of cellgro complete medium
containing soybean  xxxd207xxx  (10 mg/ml) and lima bean trypsin
inhibitor (10 mg/ml) to prevent activation of factor xi. the medium was
exchanged every 48 h. after collection, the conditioned medium was
supplemented with 5 mm  xxxd302xxx  and stored at 220 °c pending
purification.
the chimera  xxxg742xxx /pka3 (human factor xi in which the a3 domain is
replaced with the pk a3 domain) has been described (9).  xxxg742xxx /pka3
cdna was used as a template for a series of mutagenesis steps changing pk a3 sequence back to factor xi sequence (fig. 1). mutagenesis
and expression of recombinant protein were carried out as described for
alanine mutants. the original  xxxg742xxx /pka3 construct is referred to as
 xxxg742xxx /pka3-a. a construct with tyr260, leu263, and thr264 at the c
terminus of the a3 domain changed to the corresponding amino acids
for factor xi (phe260, gln263, and ser264) is referred to as  xxxg742xxx /pka3-b.
amino acids at positions 183–185 were changed to factor xi sequence in
both  xxxg742xxx /pka3-a and  xxxg742xxx /pka3-b to create  xxxg742xxx /pka3-ia and  xxxg742xxx /
pka3-ib, respectively.  xxxg742xxx /pka3-ia and  xxxg742xxx /pka3-ib were then
changed at amino acids 188 –190 to make  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iia and  xxxg742xxx /
pka3-iib, respectively, which in turn were used to prepare  xxxg742xxx /pka3iiia and  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iiib with amino acids 195–197 converted to factor
xi sequence.

purification and activation of recombinant protein
the conditioned medium (500 –2000 ml) was passed over a 3-ml
murine anti-human factor xi monoclonal antibody 1g5.12 column (9).
after loading, columns were washed with 10 volumes of 25 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.4), 100 mm nacl (tbs), and 5 mm  xxxd302xxx , followed by

elution with 2 m sodium thiocyanate in 25 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4) and 5
mm  xxxd302xxx . protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in an ultrafiltration concentrator (amicon, inc., beverly, ma),
dialyzed against tbs, and stored at 280 °c. proteins were analyzed by
sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purity, and protein concentration was measured by dye binding assay (bio-rad). activated recombinant factor xi (factor xia) was prepared by diluting zymogen protein
to 100 –300 mg/ml in tbs containing 5 mg/ml human factor xiia and
incubating at 37 °c. the progress of conversion of the 80-kda zymogen
to the 45-kda heavy chain and 35-kda light chain of factor xia was
followed by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. activated protein
was stored at 280 °c.

activity of activated recombinant protein in a
modified partial thromboplastin time assay
the coagulant activity of recombinant factor xia in a modified partial
thromboplastin time assay was determined as follows. factor xia was
diluted to 5 mg/ml (30 nm) in tbs containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (tbsa), and 1:2 serial dilutions of these preparation were made in
tbsa. sixty microliters of each dilution was mixed with 60 ml of factor
xi-deficient plasma and 60 ml of rabbit brain cephalin. after incubation
at 37 °c for 30 s, 60 ml of 25 mm cacl2 was added, and the time to clot
formation was determined on a dataclot 2 fibrometer (helena laboratories, beaumont, tx). the clotting time was compared with a standard
curve prepared with wild-type factor xia. recombinant wild-type factor
xia has the same activity as plasma-derived factor xia in this assay (9).
activities of recombinant proteins are given as a percentage of wild-type
protein activity.

cleavage of chromogenic substrate s-2366 by
recombinant factor xia
factor xia was diluted to 3.5 nm in tbs with 0.1% tween 20 (17)
containing s-2366 (50 –1000 mm), and generation of free p-nitroaniline
was followed by measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm on a
thermomax microtiter plate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca). reactions volumes were 100 ml. michaelis-menten constants (km
and vmax) for cleavage of s-2366 were determined by standard methods.
the value for vmax was converted to nm p-nitroaniline generated per s
using an extinction coefficient of 2100 optical density units (405 nm)/
mol of p-nitroaniline. turnover number (kcat) was calculated from the
ratio of vmax to enzyme concentration.

western blot assay for heparin-induced factor xi autoactivation
factor xi at 50 nm in tbs containing 25 mm  xxxd3556xxx  was supplemented
with heparin (1 unit/ml final concentration) and incubated at 37 °c. all
reactions were 400 ml.  xxxd1891xxx -min intervals, 30-ml samples were removed
into 10 ml of sds sample buffer (500 mm tris-hcl (ph 6.8), 40%
glycerol, 20% 2- xxxd26xxx , and 10% sds). samples were sizefractionated by electrophoresis on sds-10% polyacrylamide gels and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a bio-rad mini-

expression and purification of recombinant proteins—most
alanine mutants and all  xxxg742xxx /pka3 chimeras were expressed at
1–3 mg/ml of conditioned medium as determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. this is similar to expression of
recombinant wild-type factor xi (9, 17). on sds-polyacrylamide gels, the proteins ran similarly to wild-type factor xi
(fig. 2). poor (,50 ng/ml) or no expression was obtained for
alanine mutants 11–13, 15, and 18, implying that these proteins were either unstable or poorly secreted. these five proteins were not included in further analysis. substitutions in
mutants 11–13, 15, and 18 involve an area of the apple domain
constrained by a pair of disulfide bonds with relatively high
homology to the pk sequence (figs. 1 and 3). two proteins,
mutants 7 and 20, were expressed at somewhat reduced
amounts (100 –200 ng/ml of conditioned medium). substitutions in both proteins involve areas in which factor xi and pk
are identical. on sds-polyacrylamide gels, mutant 7 appears
to contain additional bands compared with wild-type factor xi,
implying altered protein structure or processing (data not
shown).
activity of factor xi alanine mutants in a plasma clotting
assay—alanine mutants were tested in a plasma clotting assay
that requires activation of  xxxg752xxx  by factor xia (9). although
the assay is not sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle differences between proteins, it is a useful screen for identifying
significant defects. activity was compared with that of recombinant wild-type factor xia. a profound decrease in activity
(10% of wild-type activity) was noted for mutants 1–3 and 5 at
the n terminus of the a3 domain and for mutants 25 and 26 at
the c terminus (table i). these substitutions involve areas in
which the amino acid sequences of factor xi and pk are significantly different (fig. 1). more modest decreases in activity
were noted for mutants 7, 10, and 20. as discussed above,
mutants 7 and 20 were expressed at lower levels than wild-type
factor xi, indicating that there may be some structural aberrations in the molecules. mutants 7, 10, and 20 involve areas in

fig. 2. recombinant factor xi molecules. two-microgram samples of purified recombinant wild-type factor xi (wild type), factor xi
alanine mutant 8 (ala #8), and the  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iiia chimera were run
under nonreducing and reducing conditions on an sds-10% polyacrylamide gel. the gel was stained with gelcode blue. dimeric factor xi
runs as a 160-kda protein under nonreducing conditions. the 80-kda
factor xi monomer is demonstrated when samples are reduced. the
positions of molecular mass markers are shown in kilodaltons to the
left. the minor band running at 66 kda in the unreduced sample for
wild-type factor xi and immediately under the wild-type factor xi band
under reducing conditions represent a small amount of residual bovine
 xxxg124xxx  from the conditioned medium.

which factor xi and pk are highly homologous and are therefore less likely to contain factor xi-specific elements required
for  xxxg752xxx  activation. the data indicate that amino acids
required for  xxxg752xxx  activation are located at the n and c
termini of the factor xi a3 domain.
activities of recombinant factor xi alanine mutants in factor xia chromogenic substrate and autoactivation assays—a
major concern when using alanine-scanning mutagenesis is
that proteins may be severely altered, resulting in a generalized rather than a specific defect in activity. the following
studies were performed to demonstrate that the factor xi alanine mutants retained activities characteristic of wild-type factor xi (other than  xxxg752xxx  activation). all proteins were converted to the active two-chain form when incubated with factor
xiia in a manner similar to recombinant wild-type factor xi
(data not shown). to determine that the catalytic (light chain)
domains of the recombinant molecules were intact, activated
proteins were tested in a chromogenic substrate cleavage assay
using the substrate s-2366 (9, 17). the kinetic parameters for
the generation of free p-nitroaniline were similar for all proteins tested (km 5 320 –565 mm and kcat 5 130 –275 s21) (table
i) and are comparable to previously published results for other
recombinant factor xi proteins (9, 17).
when exposed to certain negatively charged substances such
as heparin or the synthetic polysaccharide  xxxd1860xxx ,
factor xi undergoes autoactivation to factor xia (17, 19, 20).
this process involves a heparin-binding site in the a3 domain.
we tested alanine mutants 1– 6 and 22–26 in an autoactivation
assay in the presence of heparin. all proteins activated at a
rate similar to that of wild-type factor xi as determined by
western blotting, with the exception of mutant 23, which dem-

activation of  xxxg752xxx  by factor xia was assessed by a modification
of the method of wagenvoord et al. (18). all reagents are diluted in
tbsa. human  xxxg752xxx  (0.05–10.0 mm) was incubated with 5 mm cacl2
and 1.0 nm wild-type factor xia or activated  xxxg742xxx /pka3 chimera for 60 s
at 37 °c in a 50-ml volume. the reactions were stopped by adding edta
to 25 mm and chilling on ice. the reactions were diluted 1:100 or 1:10,
and 10 ml of each dilution was added to 50 ml of a mixture of human
factor viii (8 units/ml), cacl2 (10 mm), and rabbit brain cephalin (1:5
dilution of stock). ten microliters of human thrombin (0.6 units/ml) was
added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °c for 60 s to allow the
thrombin to activate factor viii. subsequently, 30 ml of human  xxxg741xxx 
(450 nm) was added, and incubation was continued for 10 min. the
activation of  xxxg741xxx  by factor ixa was stopped by adding edta to 25
mm and placing on ice. the final concentrations of reagents were 135 nm
 xxxg741xxx , 4 units/ml factor viii, 5 mm cacl2, and 1:10 dilution of rabbit
brain cephalin. fifty microliters of each reaction was mixed with 50 ml
of 1 mm s-2765, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was followed
on the thermomax microtiter plate reader. results were compared with
a control curve constructed with known amounts of purified factor ixa.
there was a linear correlation between the results of the assay and
factor ixa concentration between 20 and 300 pm. michaelis-menten
plots were prepared for each protein to determine the km using the
average of two sets of experiments.

onstrated significantly delayed activation, and mutant 24,
which had slightly delayed activation (data not shown). these
two mutant proteins were previously shown to be defective in
autoactivation, as they are missing parts of the heparin-binding site in the a3 domain (17). although defective in the autoactivation assay, mutants 23 and 24 have normal activity in
the plasma clotting assay. the observations that alanine mutants are activated by factor xiia, cleave a chromogenic substrate, and autoactivate normally (except for mutants 23 and
24) indicate that substitutions in a3 have not caused severe
generalized abnormalities in factor xi function. this strengthens the premise that the defects observed for mutants 1–3, 5,
25, and 26 are specific for  xxxg752xxx  activation.
activity of  xxxg742xxx /pka3 mutants in a plasma clotting assay—we previously demonstrated that factor xi with the pk
a3 domain ( xxxg742xxx /pka3) functions poorly in a plasma clotting
assay (,1% of wild-type activity) (9). guided by results with
the factor xi alanine mutants, we used  xxxg742xxx /pka3 as a template to reintroduce factor xi sequence into the a3 domain to
restore normal  xxxg752xxx  activation. this “gain-of-function”
strategy avoids some potential pitfalls of the “loss-of-function”
studies using alanine mutants. the original  xxxg742xxx /pka3 chimera
( xxxg742xxx /pka3-a) was modified at the c terminus by replacing
tyr260, leu263, and thr264 of the pk sequence with the corresponding amino acids from factor xi to create  xxxg742xxx /pka3-b
(fig. 1). this alteration involves the area of the a3 domain
covered by alanine mutants 25 and 26. as shown in table ii,
neither  xxxg742xxx /pka3-a nor  xxxg742xxx /pka3-b had significant activity
in the clotting assay. these two proteins underwent further
modifications in which progressively larger numbers of pk
amino acids at the n terminus of a3 were changed to their
factor xi counterparts. as shown in table ii, some activity was
restored in both the a and b versions of  xxxg742xxx /pka3 in which
his183–asn185 (sequence covered by alanine mutant 1) is replaced with factor xi sequence ( xxxg742xxx /pka3-ia and  xxxg742xxx /pka3ib). the activity was substantial for  xxxg742xxx /pka3-ib (40% of
normal activity). activity was restored to normal levels by
factor xi sequence at positions 188 –191 (covered by alanine
mutants 2 and 3) in  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iib. that  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iia has

only 15% of normal activity indicates that factor xi sequence at
the c terminus is important. however,  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iiia (factor
xi sequence for amino acids 195–197 (covered by alanine mutant 5)) has normal factor xia activity despite having pk sequence exclusively in its c-terminal region. this indicates that
factor xi sequence at the c terminus of the a3 domain is not
absolutely required for normal  xxxg752xxx  activation. all factor
xi/pk chimeric proteins cleaved s-2366 similarly to wild-type
protein, indicating that the catalytic domains are intact (table
ii). the data indicate that amino acids between his183 and
val191 in factor xi are required for proper interaction with
 xxxg752xxx  and that additional sequence at either ser195–ile197 or
ser258–ser264 is also necessary to completely restore activity.
km for activation of  xxxg752xxx  by activated recombinant
 xxxg742xxx /pka3—the km for activation of  xxxg752xxx  by activated
 xxxg742xxx /pka3-a has been shown to be 35-fold greater than that for
wild-type factor xia, whereas the turnover numbers (kcat) are
similar (9). these data are consistent with a defect in  xxxg752xxx 
binding. restoration of normal  xxxg752xxx  binding in this chimera should be accompanied by a reduction in the km for factor
ix activation. the km values for activation of  xxxg752xxx  by the
panel of activated  xxxg742xxx /pka3 chimeras were determined by a
two-stage assay (9). in the first stage,  xxxg752xxx  was activated
by factor xia or the activated  xxxg742xxx /pka3 chimera in the presence of calcium. in the second stage, the resulting activated
 xxxg752xxx  was used to activate  xxxg741xxx  in the presence of
calcium, phospholipid, and activated factor viii. the amount of
activated  xxxg741xxx  generated was measured with a chromogenic
substrate, and the amount of factor ixa generated in the first
stage of the assay was determined by comparison to a standard
curve. this complex assay is necessary because there is no
chromogenic substrate for factor ixa with sufficient sensitivity
to carry out kinetic studies.
the results of the study are shown in table ii. the km for
wild-type factor xia (250 nm) is similar to published results (9,
22). consistent with the clotting assay data, the km values for
activation by  xxxg742xxx /pka3-a and  xxxg742xxx /pka3-b are substantially
greater (.10 mm) than those for wild-type protein. the km
values for these two proteins are approximations because the

the value for wild-type factor xia was arbitrarily set at 100%.

actual values exceeded maximum achievable  xxxg752xxx  concentration. the km values for activation by  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iiia (270
nm),  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iiib (180 nm), and  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iib (300 nm) are
similar to the km for wild-type protein, in keeping with their
activity in the clotting assay.  xxxg742xxx /pka3-ib has a slightly increased km (590 nm), reflecting its clotting activity of 40%,
whereas values for  xxxg742xxx /pka3-iia (1.3 mm) and  xxxg742xxx /pka3-ia
(3.0 mm) reflect the lower coagulant activities of these proteins.
collectively, these data confirm the results of the clotting assays with both the factor xi/pk chimeras and the factor xi
alanine mutants. amino acids between his183 and val191 in the
a3 domain are required for normal activation of  xxxg752xxx ,
whereas ser195–ile197 or ser258–ser264 is also necessary for
complete restoration of activity (fig. 3).
discussion

the proteases of the plasma coagulation system are each
composed of distinct domains (23, 24). the carboxyl-terminal
domain resembles the pancreatic digestive enzyme trypsin.
the n-terminal region is required for specific interactions with
other components of the coagulation mechanism. the heavy
(non-catalytic) chain of factor xi contains four repeats called
apple domains (a1–a4) that are distinct from domains found in
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent coagulation proteases and factor xii (23,
24). only plasma pk has been shown to contain similar structures (14). using peptide mimicry techniques, baglia et al.
identified several prospective binding sites in the apple domains of human factor xi. binding sites for high molecular
weight kininogen (25) and thrombin (26) were localized to the
a1 domain, for platelets to the a3 domain, (27) and for factor
xiia to the a4 domain (13) based on the capacity of peptides to
interfere with protein-protein or protein-surface interactions.
several peptide sequences were identified in the factor xi a2
domain that interfere with  xxxg752xxx  activation, whereas peptides from the pk a2 domain had little effect (11). this suggests a role for the a2 domain of factor xi in binding interactions with  xxxg752xxx .

tein expression to investigate factor xi structure-function relationships (9, 17). using recombinant factor xi proteins with
individual apple domains replaced by the corresponding domains from pk, we demonstrated that substitution of factor xi
a3 results in a protein with a severe defect in  xxxg752xxx  activation. replacement of the a1, a2, or a4 domain did not alter
 xxxg752xxx  activation (9). a kinetic analysis of  xxxg752xxx  activation by the chimeric proteins strongly suggested a role for the
a3 domain in interactions with  xxxg752xxx . the km for activation
of  xxxg752xxx  by activated  xxxg742xxx /pka3 is 35-fold higher than that
for plasma factor xia, whereas the kcat values are similar,
indicating defective binding of  xxxg752xxx . furthermore, two
monoclonal antibodies directed against the factor xi a3 domain
block  xxxg752xxx  activation, whereas antibodies to the a2 and a4
domains do not (9).
the reasons for the discrepant results using two different
techniques (peptide mimicry and recombinant chimeras) are
not clear. several possibilities must be considered. the results
of the chimeric protein studies could be interpreted as demonstrating that a  xxxg752xxx -binding site is present in the a3
domain. alternatively, the a3 domain may be a component of a
binding site requiring contributions from more than one domain or may be required for proper conformation of a binding
site outside of the a3 domain (in the a2 domain, for example).
the observation that factor xi chimeras with the pk a1, a2,
and a4 domains activate  xxxg752xxx  normally indicates that
these substitutions do not disturb  xxxg752xxx  binding. components of a binding site provided by one of these three domains
would presumably be available in both the factor xi and pk
versions of these domains. if part of the a2 domain is required
for interactions with  xxxg752xxx , then the pk a2 domain provides
this binding site in the context of the factor xi heavy chain. an
additional possibility that must be considered is that the a2
domain is not required for  xxxg752xxx  interactions, but that a2
peptides interfere with  xxxg752xxx  activation by binding directly
to factor xi.
working on the premise that part of the factor xi a3 domain
is required for factor xia to activate  xxxg752xxx , a combination of
alanine-scanning mutagenesis (loss-of-function studies) and replacement of pk sequence with factor xi sequence (gain-offunction studies) was used to study the a3 domain. areas at the
n and c termini of the a3 domain required for proper  xxxg752xxx 
activation were identified (fig. 3). interestingly, these two area
are probably in close proximity to each other in the native
molecule due to the disulfide bond between cys182 and cys265

 xxxg752xxx -binding site on factor xi

d. gailani, unpublished observation.

the a4 domain is replaced with that of pk ( xxxg742xxx /pka4) is a
monomer because the a4 domain of factor xi contains critical
elements for dimer formation (9, 33).  xxxg742xxx /pka4 activates factor
ix normally in a purified protein assay (9). testing the hypothesis that dimeric factor xi is required for proper activation of
 xxxg752xxx  on a platelet surface will be facilitated by preparation
of significant amounts of a stable single chain variant of factor
xi. we are currently working on such a protein.

and could represent a contiguous binding site. the sequence
between ile183 and val191 is required for  xxxg752xxx  activation.
the data indicate, however, that this region is not sufficient for
normal interactions with  xxxg752xxx , as additional sequence between ser195 and ile197 or between phe260 and ser264 is required for  xxxg752xxx  activation to be comparable to that of
wild-type factor xia. it must be noted that these studies do not
determine if these areas of the a3 domain compose all or part
of a  xxxg752xxx -binding site or are required for conformation of a
binding site at a different location. resolution of this issue will
require determination of the actual structure of the factor
xia- xxxg752xxx  complex.
recent work has implicated the factor xi a3 domain in
binding interactions. ho et al. (21) and zhao et al. (17) independently identified a heparin-binding site involving lysines
252, 253, and 255 in the a3 domain of factor xi (fig. 3b). there
is also evidence for a platelet-binding site in this region (fig.
3b) (27, 28). a recently proposed model of factor xi physiology
suggests that the protein is activated on platelets and subsequently activates  xxxg752xxx  while bound to platelets (29). this
implies that binding sites for platelets and for  xxxg752xxx  on
factor xia are distinct. the amino acid sequences we have
identified in factor xi a3 may represent a  xxxg752xxx -binding
site. if this is the case, the close proximity to the proposed
platelet-binding site raises questions regarding the mechanism
by which factor xia would bind simultaneously to  xxxg752xxx  and
platelets through the a3 domain. a possible mechanism is
suggested by the structure of the factor xi molecule. the human protein is unique among blood coagulation proteases in
that it is a disulfide bond-linked homodimer. all other identified coagulation proteases are monomeric. each factor xia molecule therefore possesses two a3 domains (4). bovine (30),
porcine (31), and murine (22) factors xi have a similar structure. rabbit factor xi is an 80-kda monomer on sds-polyacrylamide gels (32); however, it appears to be a dimer at physiologic
ph and salt concentration.2 it is conceivable that factor xia
may use one a3 domain to interact with platelets and the other
to bind to its substrate,  xxxg752xxx , as activation of  xxxg752xxx  may
require only a single a3 domain. a factor xi molecule in which
