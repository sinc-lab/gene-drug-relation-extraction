cancer chemotherapy and cachexia: mirtazapine and olanzapine are 5-ht3 antagonists with good antinausea
effects
mirtazapine and olanzapine are easy-to-use psychiatric drugs with potent antinausea effects. ondansetron and
later members of the ’ xxxd274xxx  class are currently standard treatments for cancer chemotherapy-related nausea
and emesis. they are potent 5-ht3 blockers, but it is often not appreciated that mirtazapine and olanzapine
bind with similar affinity to 5-ht3 receptors, have a longer half-life, are considerably cheaper than the ’ xxxd274xxx 
class, and often offer better and smoother 24-h nausea control than’ xxxd274xxx  class drugs. mirtazapine and
olanzapine often have salutary antianxiety effects and improve sleep quality. they occasionally relieve
chemotherapy-related and advanced cancer-related nausea and appetite decrease better than the ’ xxxd274xxx  group
that are specifically marketed for nausea control. mirtazapine and olanzapine frequently give potent nausea
reduction and appetite increase in advanced cancer-related cachexia. several cytokine changes potentially
induced by mirtazapine and olanzapine use are discussed that may have salutary effects in several cancers.
we suggest mirtazapine and olanzapine be included as first-line options in treating both chemotherapy- and
advanced cancer-related nausea. multiple clinical and economic advantages of mirtazapine and olanzapine
over currently used’ xxxd274xxx  class medicines are reviewed. double-blind studies against the ’ xxxd274xxx  class drugs
are warranted.

nausea and emesis remain a problem in cancer chemotherapies, often limiting the ability to deliver the chemotherapy itself. also, in palliative cancer care, nausea and
emesis can drastically lower quality of life. the welcome

addition of ondansetron, granisetron and dolansetron (the
’ xxxd274xxx  class) has helped, but significant problems remain.
there have been several recent reviews of the ’ xxxd274xxx  class
(haus et al. 2004; oo & hesket 2005; schwartzberg 2006).
these are selective serotonin  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
commonly used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting
caused by cancer chemotherapy (haus et al. 2004).
although safe and effective, the ’ xxxd274xxx  class is not the
only therapeutic option for emesis and nausea reduction.
most reviews of the subject neglect a clinically important
and potent group of  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists that also
have antiemetic effects. these include the psychiatric
drugs olanzapine and mirtazapine.

olanzapine has a high affinity for the  xxxg1116xxx 
(bymaster et al. 1996, 1999, 2001). mirtazapine has a similar affinity for the  xxxg1116xxx  compared with olanzapine (de boer 1996; anttila & leinonen 2001). affinity to
5-ht3 is thought to be the basis for the ’ xxxd274xxx  class serving the antinausea, antiemesis function, and as can be
seen from table 1, 5-ht3 binding by mirtazapine and
olanzapine are similar to that of the ’ xxxd274xxx  group.
empirically, both mirtazapine and olanzapine have
common clinically observed antinausea and antiemetic
effects. in addition, both drugs have a research base supporting their use in cancer chemotherapy (passik et al.
2003, 2004; kast 2001) and in cancer cachexia (davis et al.
2002; passik et al. 2002; editorial 2003). in clinical practice, we have often seen that olanzapine and mirtazapine
demonstrate equal or superior efficacy compared with the
’ xxxd274xxx  drugs when treating nausea and vomiting after
both highly and moderately emetic chemotherapies. we
often see this appetite increase as well in cachexia of
advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy. both mirtazapine and olanzapine are easy to use, have benign sideeffect profiles and relatively low cost.
table 1 compares selected receptor-binding characteristics, half-lives and expense of the ’ xxxd274xxx  class medicines
with those of mirtazapine and olanzapine. both olanzapine and mirtazapine also have significant antagonism at
the serotonergic  xxxg1113xxx  (marek et al. 2003)
where the ’ xxxd274xxx  group do not, providing mirtazapine
and olanzapine with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, a welcome side effect in this population. the ’ xxxd274xxx  class do not have these effects. both mirtazapine and
olanzapine are strong antihistamines at the  xxxg1078xxx 
and are a great help in treating insomnia in these patients
when used at bedtime. both mirtazapine and
olanzapine can be given as a single bedtime dose. the

sound sleep-promoting, antianxiety and antidepressant
effects are retained throughout the 24-h day–night cycle
when given as a single night-time dose once daily, but we
have found in cancer chemotherapy-related nausea and
emesis control that extra daytime doses are sometimes
needed too.
table 1 also clearly indicates cost savings with both
mirtazapine and olanzapine compared with the ’ xxxd274xxx 
group.
interleukin-6 (il-6) is a pleiotropic 26-kda cytokine
synthesized by numerous cell types, notably lymphocytes,
mast cells, epithelial cells and neurones. elevated il-6 is
seen in several cancers with good evidence that it functions as an important growth factor in glioblastoma (kast
& altschuler 2006), multiple myeloma (jourdan et al.
2005; reviewed in kast 2006a), prostate cancer (culig et al.
2005), melanoma (soubrane et al. 2005; reviewed in kast
2006b), colon cancer (becker et al. 2004; atreya &
neurath 2005) and many others. there is some evidence
that strong h1 antihistamine medicines could lower elevated il-6 (kast & altschuler 2004; altschuler & kast
2005a, b). an example is reduction in nasal secretion il-6
after the potent h1 antihistamines mizolastine or fexofenadine (ciprandi et al. 2004). there are many other
such examples.
interleukin-6-lowering effects of antihistamines, if
future study affirms this association, would make mirtazapine and olanzapine particularly useful in the treatment of il-6-related cancers when nausea control is
needed.
also of interest is that 5-ht3 antagonists are now being
used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs).
drugs such as  xxxd3097xxx , alosetron and  xxxd1692xxx  are
currently available or being studied for the treatment of
ibs. since 5-ht3 receptors are ligand-gated cation channels which are found throughout the gut wall on enteric
neurones, antagonism of these receptors is able to modu-

pka is the dissociation constant, corresponding to concentration of the drug at which 50% of receptors are bound (and in these cases,
inactivated). the lower the number the tighter the drug binds to the receptor. pka is listed for histamine-1 (h1), serotonin-3 (6-ht3),
and serotonin-2a (5-ht2a) receptors.
mirtazapine is the only generic drug of these; the rest are still proprietary as of july 2005.

cancer chemotherapy and cachexia

late visceral pain, colonic transit speed and gastrointestinal (gi) secretions. it is therefore possible that olanzapine
and mirtazapine may find use in the treatment of gi
dysfunctions currently categorized as ibs and, in mechanistically similar fashion, be helpful in treating cancerrelated or cancer treatment-related nausea, appetite suppression and abdominal distress.
mirtazapine is available generically in the european
union and north american markets, making it many
times cheaper than the currently, more commonly
used’ xxxd274xxx  class. even proprietary olanzapine, expensive
as it is, can be a tenth of the price of the ’ xxxd274xxx  class medicines per patient/day in the treatment of cancer chemotherapy nausea and vomiting. (see comparative expenses
as of autumn 2005 in table 1.)
in summary, when compared with’ xxxd274xxx  class medicines, mirtazapine and olanzapine are cheaper and easier
to use due to their longer half-life, and in our experience,
often have equal or superior efficacy in nausea and vomiting control. the superior nausea and emesis control
achievable with mirtazapine and olanzapine, compared
with’ xxxd274xxx  group medicines, allows an occasional patient
to contine a potential curative chemotherapy that would
otherwise have to be interrupted. also, in palliative care,
we often see appetite and enjoyment of meals maintained
well into the terminal phase, especially with olanzapine.
double-blind placebo trials of this question are needed.
mirtazapine and olanzapine should not be forgotten in
day-to-day practice, and all who treat cancer patients
should be familiar with their use.
