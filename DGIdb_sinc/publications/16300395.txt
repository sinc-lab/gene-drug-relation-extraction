abstract: fibroblast growth factor ( xxxg786xxx ) lacks a signal sequence and is exported by an unconventional
release mechanism. the nonclassical export of  xxxg786xxx  has been shown to be inhibited by an anti-allergic
and anti-inflammatory drug,  xxxd157xxx  (amx). we investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying
the inhibitory action of amx on the release of  xxxg786xxx , using a variety of biophysical techniques including
multidimensional nmr spectroscopy. amx binds to  xxxg786xxx  and enhances its conformational stability.
amx binds to locations close to cys30 and sterically blocks cu2+-induced oxidation, leading to the
formation of the homodimer of  xxxg786xxx . amx-induced inhibition of the formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer
is observed both under cell-free conditions and in living cells. results of this study suggest a novel approach
for the design of drugs against  xxxg786xxx -mediated disorders.

proteins released through the conventional secretory
pathway mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (er)1 and
the golgi apparatus contain a signal peptide sequence at the
amino-terminal end (1). however, there are several extracellular proteins, such as interleukin 1r ( xxxg1171xxx ),  xxxg1170xxx ,
fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2, transglutaminase,  xxxg639xxx  1, annexin 2, and the proteins belonging to
the s100 family, that lack the signal peptide sequence but
are secreted into the extracellular medium (for a review, see
refs 2 and 3). although the mechanism(s) of release of
proteins through the nonclassical pathways is not fully
understood, it is now a subject of intensive investigation.
prototype  xxxg786xxx  ( xxxg786xxx ) is a signal
peptide-less, heparin-binding protein, devoid of intramolecular disulfide bonds (4, 5).  xxxg786xxx  regulates a wide array of
important biological processes such as angiogenesis, differentiation, tumor growth, and neurogenesis (4). although
 xxxg786xxx  acts through specific transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx 
receptors, it lacks a classical signal peptide to direct its
secretion to the extracellular compartment (6). under normal
conditions,  xxxg786xxx  is not released from cells that express it.
 xxxg786xxx  is shown to be secreted from  xxxg786xxx -transfected cells

in response to stress conditions in vitro, such as hypoxia
and heat shock (2). stress-induced release of  xxxg786xxx  from
the  xxxg786xxx -transfected nih 3t3 cells occurs through a
brefeldin a-insensitive, er-golgi-independent pathway. it
is believed that the nonclassical release of  xxxg786xxx  is an
inherent protective mechanism developed during the course
of evolution to regulate the high mitogenic potential and
widespread expression of  xxxg786xxx  (2). in this context, it is
interesting to note that recombinant  xxxg786xxx  expressed with
an n-terminal signal sequence behaves as a potent oncoprotein (8).
under stress conditions,  xxxg786xxx  is released as an inactive
homodimer that is unable to bind to heparin (7). the
mitogenic activity of  xxxg786xxx  may be completely regained in
the presence of reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol,
suggesting that the homodimer is formed because of an
intermolecular disulfide bond (2, 7, 9). site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer released
into the extracellular medium is formed because of selective
oxidation of the thiol group of highly conserved cys30 (10;
figure 1a). results of cell-free experiments showed that the
formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer is due to the cu2+induced oxidation of the thiol group of cys30 (11). it is
noteworthy that treatment with tetrathiomolybdate (ttm),
a specific copper chelator, was demonstrated to suppress
 xxxg786xxx  release in cell culture (12), and it dramatically inhibits
the accumulation of  xxxg786xxx  and intimal hyperplasia (restenosis) in the walls of rat carotid arteries in response to
balloon angioplasty (15). however, additional experiments
are required to unequivocally prove that formation of the
homodimer is a mandatory mechanism for the stress-induced
release of  xxxg786xxx  into the extracellular compartment.
it was demonstrated that the anti-allergic and antiinflammatory drug,  xxxd157xxx  (amx, figure 1b), which
inhibits the degranulation of mast cells, is also able to inhibit
the release of  xxxg786xxx  (13, 14). in vitro studies revealed that

structure of  xxxg786xxx . the residues involved in amx binding are
shown in red. (b) chemical structure of amx.

cells exposed to amx exhibit a dose-dependent inhibition
of migration and proliferation without an increase in apoptotic cell death (14). amx affects the organization of actin
stress fibers without attenuating the expression and polymerization of actin (14). the inhibitory effect of amx on
 xxxg786xxx  release is believed to be at least partially linked to
the effect(s) of the drug (amx) on the actin cytoskeleton
(14). in the present study, we demonstrate that amx directly
binds to human  xxxg786xxx  and blocks cu2+-induced homodimerization of the protein. these results emphasize the
importance of dimerization of  xxxg786xxx  for its stress-induced
release into the extracellular compartment.
materials and methods
ingredients for luria broth were obtained from amresco. aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, tritonx-100,  xxxd1071xxx  (ammonium salt), and  xxxd26xxx  were obtained
from sigma. heparin-sepharose was obtained from amersham biosciences. labeled 15nh4cl and d2o were purchased
from cambridge isotope laboratories. the other chemicals
used were of high-quality analytical grade. the experiments
were performed at 25 °c. unless specified, solutions were
made in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.5) containing 100 mm
nacl. amx was obtained from takeda company, japan.
protein purification. overexpression and purification of
human  xxxg786xxx  was achieved using methods reported by
arunkumar et al. (16). 1h, 15n, and 13c resonance assignments and the three-dimensional structure of  xxxg786xxx  were
reported by ogura et al. (17).
turbidity measurements. turbidity measurements were
performed on a hitachi u-3310 spectrophotometer. all
measurements were made after 30 s of incubation of  xxxg786xxx 
with 0.1 mm cucl2 and 0.2 mm amx at room temperature.
the concentration of the protein used in the turbidity

biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 47, 2005 15473
experiments was 100 µm. the turbidity of the solutions was
measured by absorbance at 600 nm. the path length of the
sample cell used was 10 mm.
steady-state fluorescence. fluorescence experiments were
performed on a hitachi f2500 spectrofluorimeter at 5 or 10
nm resolution. intrinsic fluorescence measurements were
made at a protein concentration of 50 µm, using an excitation
wavelength of 280 nm. for the thermal denaturation experiments, the protein and amx were mixed in a 1:1 ratio in
10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.5) containing 100 mm nacl. the
requisite temperature(s) in the thermal denaturation experiments was attained using a neslab circulating water bath.
proteolytic digestion assay. the limited proteolytic
experiments on  xxxg786xxx  and the  xxxg786xxx -amx mixture (1:1)
were carried out (at 25 ( 2 °c) using trypsin. proteolytic
digestions were performed at an enzyme (trypsin)/substrate
( xxxg786xxx ) molar ratio of 1:100. the protease activity was
stopped after a desired time interval by the addition of the
gel loading dye (bio-rad) at 80 ( 2 °c. the degree of
proteolytic cleavage was measured from the intensity of the
∼16-kda band (on a sds-page gel) corresponding to the
uncleaved protein ( xxxg786xxx ), using a densitometer. the
intensity of the ∼16-kda band (corresponding to  xxxg786xxx ) not
subjected to protease treatment was considered as a control
for 100% protection against trypsin cleavage.
isothermal calorimetry. binding of amx to  xxxg786xxx  was
analyzed by measuring the heat change during the titration
of amx into the protein solution using vp-itc titration
microcalorimeter (microcal, inc., northampton, ma). all
protein and ligand (amx) solutions were degassed under
vacuum and equilibrated at 25 °c prior to titration. the
sample cell (1.4 ml) contained 0.2 mm  xxxg786xxx  dissolved in
10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.5) containing 100 mm nacl. the
reference cell contained water. upon equilibration, 2 mm
amx drug was injected in 47 × 6 µl aliquots using the
default injection rate of 200 s intervals between each injection
to allow the sample to return to the baseline. the resulting
titration curves were corrected for the protein-free buffer
control and analyzed using the software supplied by microcal, inc.
nmr experiments. all nmr experiments were performed
on a bruker avance-700 mhz nmr spectrometer equipped
with a cryoprobe at 25 °c. 15n decoupling during acquisition
was accomplished using the globally optimized altering-phase
rectangular pulse sequence. spectra were acquired with 8
transients of 1024 data points and 64 t1 increments. the
hsqc spectra were recorded at 32 scans at all concentrations
of amx. the concentration of the protein sample was 0.5
mm in 95% h2o and 5% d2o [10 mm tris (ph 7.5)]
containing 100 mm nacl. all of the spectra were processed
on a windows workstation using xwin-nmr and sparky
softwares (18).
molecular docking. molecular docking of  xxxg786xxx  and
amx was performed using the ab initio docking software
bigger (19). the docking procedure is composed of two
modules that work in a sequence. the first module (bogie,
boolean geometric interaction evaluation) is a grid-like search
algorithm, which generates a population of docked geometries with maximal surface matching and favorable intermolecular amino acid contacts. the first step is the generation
of a three-dimensional matrix composed of small cubic cells
of 1 å size, which represents the complex shape of each

15474 biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 47, 2005
molecule. for every relative orientation of two interacting
molecules, the translational interaction space is searched by
systematically shifting the matrixes defining one molecule
(the probe, amx) relative to the matrixes representing the
other partner (the target,  xxxg786xxx ). structures involving
unrealistic interpenetration of the docking partners are
discarded. the second module (interact) evaluates the
population of putative solutions according to four different
interaction terms (surface matching, side-chain contacts,
electrostatic, and solvation energies) combined into a global
scoring function and computed for every docked geometry.
the structures of the  xxxg786xxx /amx complex as obtained by
the docking algorithm filtered by nmr data (1h-15n chemical-shift perturbation data) were first minimized in a preparation step, using the conjugate-gradient method by the powell
algorithm. all parameters were minimized. then, a molecular
dynamics calculation (amber force field) was performed
on the selected complex structures. the final energy minimized structure of the  xxxg786xxx /amx complex was represented
using the molmol software (20).
measurement of amide proton exchange. protein solutions
with or without amx (at a 1:1 protein/drug ratio) were
prepared in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.5) containing 100 mm
nacl and dried by lyophilization (21, 22). hydrogendeuterium (h/d) exchange is initiated by dissolving dry
protein in 10 mm tris-buffered d2o (pd 7.5, at 25 °c). all
nmr data acquisition parameters were preset using a mock
sample, and the sample ph was measured after the experiment, to minimize the dead time. the first 1h-15n hsqc
spectrum was acquired within 10 min of initiation of
exchange. spectra were acquired with 8 transients of 1024
data points and 64 t1 increments. a total of 50 spectra were
collected in 48 h with various time points. amide proton
exchange was measured by monitoring the peak intensities
in the 1h-15n hsqc spectra acquired after various time
periods of exchange. the percentage proton occupancy
values of residues in  xxxg786xxx  (in the presence or absence of
amx) were estimated from the intensities of individual 1h15
n cross-peaks in the 1h-15n hsqc spectra of the protein,
acquired at different time points after initiation of the
hydrogen-deuterium (h/d) exchange. the intensities of
individual cross-peaks in the first 1h-15n hsqc spectrum
(acquired within 10 min of initiation of h/d exchange) are
considered equivalent to 100% proton occupancy. 1h-15n
hsqc spectra were referenced internally to a nonexchangeable aliphatic proton resonance in the one-dimensional 1h
spectra.
study of the amx effect in living cells. stable  xxxg786xxx 
nih 3t3 cell transfectants were plated in dmem (cellgro)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (hyclone) on
human fibronectin-coated (10 µg/cm2) 15 cm dishes. to
evaluate the effect of amx upon the  xxxg786xxx  dimer formation,
cells were preincubated for 12 h with 0.375 mm amx
(takeda). after preincubation, amx-treated cells were
transferred to serum-free medium with 0.375 mm amx and
10 units/ml heparin (sigma) and incubated for an additional
2 h at 37 or 42 °c. control cells were incubated under similar
conditions without amx. after temperature stress, cells were
lysed in laemmlie loading buffer without  xxxd26xxx 
(nonreducing conditions) and 10% of cell lysate derived from
each dish was resolved in 15% sds-page. to assess the
effect of amx on  xxxg786xxx  release, conditioned media were

rajalingam et al.
collected from heat-shocked and control dishes, filtered, and
incubated for 2 h at 37 °c with 1.25 µg/ml dithiothreitol.
 xxxg786xxx  was isolated from conditioned media by using heparin
sepharose chromatography as previously described (28) and
loaded to 15% sds-page. resolved proteins were transferred to hybond c (amersham), immunoblotted using antifgf-1 polyclonal antibodies, and visualized using the ecl
kit (amersham).
results and discussion
the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the amx-induced
inhibition of the nonclassical release of  xxxg786xxx  is not clearly
understood. the inhibitory action of amx on the nonclassical release of  xxxg786xxx  could be due to several factors. (i)
 xxxg786xxx  is characterized to be a cu2+-binding protein (12).
amx can possibly bind near the cu2+-binding sites in the
monomeric state of  xxxg786xxx . as a consequence, amx can
inhibit the formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer by steric
masking of the thiol group of cys30 from oxidation induced
by cu2+. the formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer may be
mandatory for its ( xxxg786xxx ) release into the extracellular
medium. (ii) there is a sequence of predicted molecular
events that eventually leads to the release of  xxxg786xxx  into the
extracellular medium (2). the predicted initial step is the
interaction of the  xxxg786xxx  homdimer with  xxxg2004xxx , a
calcium-binding protein belonging to the s100 family (23).
 xxxg786xxx  is exported out into the extracellular compartment
through a complex chain of molecular events that are not
clearly understood (2). in principle, amx can bind to any
of the protein players (involved in the release pathway) and
disrupt/interfere with the predicted chain of protein-protein
interactions involved in the release of  xxxg786xxx . (iii) amx may
also alter the membrane properties and thereby inhibit the
transmembrane translocation of the  xxxg786xxx . to understand
the exact mode of action of amx, we investigated the
binding of the drug (amx) using several physical methods
including nmr spectroscopy.
amx binds to the monomeric state of  xxxg786xxx . isothermal
titration calorimetry (itc) is a direct method to evaluate the
stoichiometry, affinity, and enthalpy of binding reactions in
solution and has been successfully employed to characterize
the binding of small ligands to their protein partners (24).
in this context, we used itc to examine whether  xxxg786xxx  has
an affinity to bind to amx. amx binds to  xxxg786xxx ; this
interaction is endothermic (figure 2). the equilibrium
dissociation constant (kd) defining the protein/drug interaction is about 80 µm, suggesting that the drug binds to the
protein with moderate affinity. the  xxxg786xxx /amx-binding
isotherms are best represented as a one independent site
model, yielding a stoichiometry of binding equal to 1 amx
molecule/molecule of  xxxg786xxx . the binding of  xxxg786xxx  proceeds
with a positive enthalpy, suggesting that nonpolar interactions
play a predominant role in the protein/drug interaction.
 xxxg786xxx  is stabilized by amx binding.  xxxg786xxx  contains a
single well-conserved tryptophan at position 121 (5). the
emission spectrum of the protein is dominated by a tyrosine
emission peak at 308 nm. however, in the completely
unfolded state (in 8 m urea),  xxxg786xxx  exhibits an emission
spectrum dominated by tryptophan fluorescence at 350 nm.
these spectral features are ideal to monitor the denaturantinduced unfolding of the protein. equilibrium thermal

amx. (b) integrated data obtained from the raw data, after
subtracting the heat of dilution. the solid line (b) represents the
best curve fit to the data, using the one independent site mode (from
microcal origin).

denaturation of  xxxg786xxx  was performed to assess the conformational stability of  xxxg786xxx  upon binding to amx (figure
3a). the tm (the temperature at which 50% of the molecules
are in the native state) of the protein increases in the presence
of the drug by about 5 °c (from 55 to 60 °c), suggesting
that thermodynamic stability of the protein is enhanced upon
binding to the drug.
limited proteolytic digestion is a popular technique to
probe the protein-ligand interactions (25). proteolytic digestion, in general, is governed not only by stereochemistry and
accessibility of the protein substrate but also by the specificity
of the proteolytic enzyme. in principle, binding of a ligand/
drug can potentially mask the cleavage sites in the protein
substrate, and these subtle differences in the cleavage patterns
(between the free and the ligand/drug-bound protein substrate) could be easily detected by sds-page analysis.
because  xxxg786xxx  is rich in arginine and lysine residues, we
opted to perform a limited trypsin digestion to probe the
binding of amx to  xxxg786xxx . time-dependent trypsin digestion
of the protein (in the free and amx-bound forms) was
monitored by sds-page analysis. the degree of digestion
was measured on the basis of the intensity (after coomassie
blue staining) of the ∼16-kda band (on the polyacrylamide
gel) corresponding to the undigested  xxxg786xxx . sds-page
analysis of the tryptic digests of  xxxg786xxx , obtained in the
presence and absence of amx, clearly revealed that the
protein upon binding to the drug is more resistant to
proteolytic cleavage (figure 3b). the enhanced resistance
to trypsin cleavage could be due to masking of some of the
potential enzyme cleavage sites in  xxxg786xxx  by amx. interestingly, an additional low molecular cleavage product (mr <
5 kda) is observed when  xxxg786xxx  is subjected to limited

that the protein in the presence of amx is more resistant to trypsin
cleavage. an extra cleavage product (indicated by an arrow) is
generated when the protein is treated with trypsin in the absence
of amx. control experiments revealed that the drug presence does
not have inhibitory effects on trypsin.

trypsin digestion in the absence of amx (lane 2 in figure
3b). this extra cleavage product is not observed in the tryptic
digest of  xxxg786xxx  obtained in the presence of amx (lane 3
in figure 3b). these results clearly indicate that amx binds
to  xxxg786xxx  and sterically restricts the exposure of the trypsin
cleavage sites at the drug-binding site. in addition, sizeexclusion chromatography experiments show that increased
resistance of the protein to proteolytic cleavage is not due
to protein oligomerization induced upon drug binding (yu
et al., unpublished data).
cys30 is a part of the amx-binding site in  xxxg786xxx . nmr
spectroscopy is a versatile technique to map the proteindrug interface at an atomic resolution and also to measure
the binding affinity and stoichiometry of protein-ligand
interactions (26). the 1h-15n hsqc spectrum is a fingerprint

figure 4: (a) weighted average (of 15n and 1h) chemical-shift perturbation [∆delta ) x(deltah2 + 0.2(delta15n)2)] of residues in  xxxg786xxx  upon
complex formation with amx (at a protein/amx ratio of 1:1). it could be discerned that leu28, cys30, his35, his138, tyr139, leu147,
and leu149 displayed maximal chemical-shift perturbation. these residues constituted the putative amx-binding site. the horizontal line
is an arbitrary line drawn to demarcate residues, which exhibit significant chemical-shift perturbation from those that show insignificant
chemical perturbation (<0.07 ppm). (b) overlays of the cys30 cross-peak in the 1h-15n hsqc spectra of  xxxg786xxx  obtained at increasing
concentrations of amx. blue, white, red, pink, and green spectra correspond to protein/amx ratios of 1:0, 1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, and 1:1,
respectively. the arrow indicates the direction of the shift of the cross-peak corresponding to cys30 in the 1h-15n hsqc spectra. it can
be seen that the cross-peak representing cys30 shows a progressive chemical shift, suggesting its involvement in the binding of amx. (c)

of the conformational state(s) of the protein. each crosspeak in the spectrum represents an amino acid in a particular
conformational state of the protein. therefore, the ligandbinding site(s) in a protein could be conveniently identified
by a chemical-shift perturbation/disappearance of cross-peaks
in the 1h-15n hsqc spectrum. 1h-15n hsqc spectra of
 xxxg786xxx  acquired at various  xxxg786xxx /amx ratios revealed that
only a few cross-peaks were perturbed from their original
positions in the native-state spectrum (figure 4a and
supplementary figure s1 in the supporting information). the
residues, which exhibit prominent 1h-15n chemical-shift
perturbations, include leu28, cys30, his35, his138, tyr139,
leu147, and leu149 (parts a and b of figure 4). in addition,
the 1h-15n cross-peak corresponding to leu27 disappeared
(even at a amx/protein ratio of 0.2:1.0) because of kinetic
line-broadening effects. the residues in the amx-binding
pocket span beta-strands i and xii constituting the beta-barrel
architecture of the  xxxg786xxx  molecule (5). modeling the  xxxg786xxx 
and amx interface using bigger software based on the
1
h-15n chemical-shift data indicated that the residues, which
bind to the drug, were located in close proximity in the threedimensional structure of  xxxg786xxx  (figure 4c). titration curves
generated on the basis of the weighted average chemical-

shift perturbation values of individual residues corroborated
with the itc data and demonstrated that the stoichiometry
of binding of  xxxg786xxx /amx is 1:1 (supplementary figure s2
in the supporting information).
amide-proton exchange monitored by nmr spectroscopy
is a versatile technique to monitor conformational flexibility
of proteins and to map protein-protein or protein-ligand
interface(s) (27). in general, solvent accessibility to the
transiently unfolded portions of proteins allows the exchange
of the amide protons for deuterons to take place on time
scales that range from hours to days (27). amide protons
involved in the protein-protein or protein-ligand interface
are expected to be relatively more shielded from exchange.
therefore, the binding interface can be easily identified by
comparing the exchange rates in the absence and presence
of the interacting protein or ligand. we mapped the amxbinding sites on  xxxg786xxx  by hydrogen-deuterium exchange
monitored by 1h-15n hsqc spectra (figure 5). a comparison
of exchange rates of the amide protons in  xxxg786xxx , in the
absence and presence of amx, revealed that the amide
protons of residues involved in the  xxxg786xxx /amx interface
(leu27, leu28, cys30, his35, his138, tyr139, leu147, and
leu149) exhibited relatively higher protection to exchange

figure 5: amide proton exchange of selected residues in  xxxg786xxx  in the presence (o) and absence (b) of amx. it could be observed that
the residues involved in the amx-binding site show significantly higher protection in the presence of the drug than in its absence. asp46
is not involved in amx binding, and hence, its amide proton exchange is representative for residues (in  xxxg786xxx ) not involved in drug
binding. the amide proton-exchange data clearly suggest that cys30, his138, and tyr139 are part of the amx-binding site in the protein.

than those residues that are located at sites remote from the
drug-binding sites (figure 5). interestingly, in the presence
of amx, the amide proton occupancy of cys30 was more
than 80%, suggesting that the drug bound to  xxxg786xxx  and
protected the amide proton of cys30 from hydrogendeuterium exchange.
amx prevents the cu2+-induced oxidation of cys30. as
mentioned earlier, the homodimer of  xxxg786xxx  released under
stress conditions is formed because of the specific oxidation
of the thiol group of cys30 (10, 11). interestingly, cys30 is
located in the putative amx-binding site. in this background,
we examined whether binding of amx could prevent the
formation of the cu2+-induced homodimer of  xxxg786xxx  in vitro.
sds-page analysis demonstrated that, in the absence of
amx, cu2+ induced formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer
(lane 3 in figure 6b). in contrast, under similar experimental
conditions, amx thwarts the formation of the cu2+-induced
homodimer of  xxxg786xxx  (lane 2 in figure 6b). the homodimer
of  xxxg786xxx  induced by cu2+ undergoes time-dependent aggregation. therefore, we studied the effect(s) of amx on
the cu2+-induced homodimerization of  xxxg786xxx  by turbidometric measurements at 600 nm. in the absence of amx,
the 600 nm absorbance progressively increases and reaches
a steady plateau within 200 s of the addition of copper
(figure 6a). it is noteworthy, in the presence of amx (at a
protein/amx ratio of 1:1), that there is no significant increase
in the 600 nm absorbance even after 5 h of the addition of
copper. collectively, the results of turbidometry and sdspage analysis unambiguously suggest that amx inhibits
the formation of the cu2+-induced homodimer in a cell-free
system.
amx inhibits the formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer in
living cells. to understand whether amx attenuates the
stress-induced formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer in living
cells, we evaluated the level of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer in
amx-treated cells at normal and heat-shock conditions. nih

3t3 cells stably transfected with  xxxg786xxx  were subjected to
amx treatment followed by heat shock in the presence of
amx (figure 6c). about 1/10 of the total  xxxg786xxx  content is
released at heat shock (7, 28). the concentration of amx
used in our experiments (0.375 mm) is known to induce
about 80% inhibition of  xxxg786xxx  export (13), and we observed
a similar suppression of  xxxg786xxx  export (lower panel of figure
6c). because the isolation of  xxxg786xxx  from conditioned
medium requires the reduction of released dimers to allow
the efficient  xxxg786xxx  binding to heparin (7, 28), conditioned
medium-derived  xxxg786xxx  was detected as a monomer. to
prevent reduction of the intracellular  xxxg786xxx  homodimers,
cell lysates were electrophoretically resolved in  xxxd26xxx -free conditions. heat shock induced a significant
decrease of the intracellular levels of mono- and dimeric
 xxxg786xxx  in both amx-treated and untreated cell lysates (upper
and middle panels of figure 6c), which can be explained
by the stress-induced downregulation of protein synthesis.
it was observed that amx treatment resulted in a specific
strong reduction of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer but not the  xxxg786xxx 
monomer level, at both stress and normal conditions (upper
and middle panels of figure 6c). these results indicate that
amx-dependent attenuation of  xxxg786xxx  dimerization occurs
both in cell-free conditions and in the cell culture.
results of this study clearly demonstrate that amx binds
to  xxxg786xxx  at a site proximal to cys30 and inhibits the
formation of the copper-induced homodimer both in cellfree conditions and in living cells. amx-mediated inhibition of the release of  xxxg786xxx  through the nonclassical pathway appears to be primarily due to the abolition of the
formation of the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer. in the presence of the
drug,  xxxg786xxx  is entrapped inside the cell and is unable to be
secreted into the extracellular compartment in response to
stress conditions. therefore, it appears that formation of
the homodimer is mandatory for the release of  xxxg786xxx  into
an extracellular compartment under stress. the finding

figure 6: (a) turbidometric assay to monitor the formation of
the  xxxg786xxx  homodimer. the homodimer of  xxxg786xxx  has a tendency
to aggregate with time. therefore, the formation of the homodimer
is monitored by the change in absorbance at 600 nm. it could be
observed that, in the presence of amx, the change in absorbance
(at 600 nm) is insignificant, suggesting that the drug inhibits the
formation of the homodimer. (b) sds-page analysis of the amx
effect upon the cu2+-induced  xxxg786xxx  dimer formation in a cellfree system, under a nonreducing condition. lane 1,  xxxg786xxx  in the
absence of copper; lane 2,  xxxg786xxx  in the presence of 50 µm cu2+
and 50 µm amx; lane 3,  xxxg786xxx  in the presence of 50 µm cu2+.
cu2+-induced homodimer formation is almost completely inhibited
in the presence of amx. (c) upper panel,  xxxg786xxx  homodimer (32
kda); middle panel,  xxxg786xxx  monomer (16 kda) in cell lysates (cl).
the formation of the homodimer is significantly inhibited in the
presence of amx, under both normal and heat-shock conditions,
which correlates with the amx-induced suppression of heat-shockinduced  xxxg786xxx  release to the conditioned medium (cm, lower
panel).

that amx specifically inhibits the homodimerization of
the potent mitogen  xxxg786xxx  provides valuable clues for the
rational design of novel pharmacological approaches to the
treatment of inflammatory, cardiovascular, and oncological
disorders.
