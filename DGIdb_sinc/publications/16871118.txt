abstract: antidotal therapy can be lifesaving in the management of
poisoned children. although supportive care is sufficient in many
cases, a specific antidote can significantly reduce morbidity and
mortality in a number of poisoning scenarios, and so the pediatric
emergency medicine practitioner must be familiar with its indications for use, dosage and administration, and contraindications.
a number of new antidotes have emerged in recent years. this
review discusses the pediatric uses and limitations of intravenous  xxxd68xxx , octreotide, crotaline fab antivenom,  xxxd2148xxx , atropine and pralidoxime autoinjectors and provides some
brief discussion on newer antidotes for which data is only starting
to emerge.

becomes more stumbling and blurry eyed in the course of
24 hours, at which time an antidote is administered with
miraculous, lifesaving result. unfortunately, specific antidotes are infrequently available or indicated for most pediatric
poisoning scenarios. when available, the clinical effect is
seldom so dramatic.
although each agent has a unique pharmacological
profile, a few principles are universal to the use of antidotal
therapy. it is clear that the fundamental emergency medicine
principles of supportive care remain paramount in emergency
clinical toxicology. most poisoned patients derive more
benefit from attentive supportive care than from a specific
antidote. an antidote may treat troublesome but not lifethreatening aspects of the overdose, but the side effect profile
of the antidote itself may be threatening. for example, most
benzodiazepine overdoses can be managed with careful
airway and breathing control; although the administration of
flumazenil may briefly produce analepsis, it may also precipitate seizures. there are, of course, instances in which
antidotal therapy is absolutely essential and of undisputed
benefit. for example,  xxxd68xxx  (nac) clearly

prevents hepatic necrosis associated with acetaminophen
overdose.
a second principle is that poisons and antidotes each
possess their own pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties, which may not match one another. for instance,
the central nervous system and respiratory depression associated with most opioid poisonings can be expected to
last much longer than the 30 to 60 minutes of naloxoneâ€™s
duration of action. this may also be an issue with the use of
flumazenil and with octreotide and crotaline antivenom
which will be discussed below.
lastly, as with many pediatric drug therapies, many of
the antidotes are used because of evidence in adult patients
but are not approved by the united states food and
drug administration (fda) specifically for use in children.
although this should not discourage the use of needed
therapy in pediatric patients, it highlights the reality that, for
many therapies, pediatric experience is limited. because this
is a review of emerging antidotes, most of the agents
discussed here are, in fact, â€˜â€˜off-labelâ€™â€™ for pediatric usage in
the united states.
in 2003, a total of 2,395,582 human poisoning
exposures were reported to the american association of
poison control centers, with 66% occurring among patients
aged 19 years or younger and 52% being noted among
children aged 5 years or younger.1 excluding gastrointestinal
decontamination and supportive use of benzodiazepines,
43,278 instances of specific antidote administration were
recorded among the 2.4 million reports in this database.
table 1 provides a list of most of the commonly available
antidotes used in the united states. the most commonly
administered antidotes in 2003, according to the american
association of poison control centers toxic exposures
surveillance system, are provided in table 2. in this article,
we will review the following novel antidotes: intravenous
nac,  xxxd2148xxx , crotalinae polyvalent immune fab antivenom, octreotide, and pediatric nerve agent antidote
(atropine, pralidoxime [2-pam]) autoinjectors. consultations with a regional poison control center or a medical
toxicologist remain as valuable resources for providing
expert care to poisoned children.

intravenous nac
analgesics are by far the most common source of
pharmaceutical poisoning each year, and the great majority
of these cases involve acetaminophen. although intentional
overdose of acetaminophen is a common scenario for these
exposures, cases in young children do occur, largely from
exploratory ingestions or repeated supratherapeutic dosing

quickly depletes cellular glutathione stores required for napqi
detoxification, causing free radicalâ€“mediated tissue damage.
hepatic injury is manifested by characteristic elevation of
hepatic transaminases and can progress to centrilobular necrosis
and fulminant hepatic failure.
 xxxd68xxx  acts on a number of sites along this
cascade to prevent and counteract napqiâ€™s effects.2 early
on, nac blocks the production of napqi at the p450
enzyme level. it donates sulfur moieties to replete cellular
glutathione and also acts as a glutathione substitute. in
addition, nac has nonspecific antioxidant effects, which
have lead to its use in other free radical â€“mediated disease
states, such as contrast nephropathy.3
oral nac therapy has been used widely in the united
states for decades and entirely prevents hepatic failure when
administered within 8 hours after single overdose. although
efficacy wanes as more time from ingestion elapses, it is still
far more effective than placebo when it is given as late as
24 hours after ingestion and perhaps even later.4 the
standard 72-hour protocol (140 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 17 doses of 70 mg/kg) is a common practice, but
it is complicated by issues of poor palatability, emesis, and
lengthy hospitalization.
intravenous nac therapy has been the standard of care
for many centers outside the united states; only recently, it
has become commonplace in this country. the most common
relative indications for intravenous nac in the united states
have historically included acetaminophen poisoning complicated by pregnancy, presentation of more than 8 hours
after acute overdose, or recalcitrant vomiting. early debates
surrounding efficacy were resolved when intravenous and
oral regimens of similar duration were carefully evaluated,
with comparable results.5,6 smaller pediatric studies have
had similar results.7 a 21-hour protocol of 150 mg/kg
loading dose for 1 hour, followed by 150 mg/kg for 4 hours
(12.5 mg/kg per hour), then 150 mg/kg for more 16 hours
(6.25 mg/kg per hour) is the standard. although sufficient in
most cases, patients with worsening transaminase elevation
or persistently elevated acetaminophen levels should receive
continued nac therapy until recovery is clear.
although the efficacy of intravenous and oral nac are
similar, the side effect profiles differ significantly. the

errors. the use of oral nac (mucomyst1) to prevent hepatocellular damage and necrosis is an established and
effective therapy. until recently, us physicians had to resort
to oral nac preparations compounded for intravenous
use when the intravenous route was deemed more suitable.
now, however, in many institutions intravenous nac
(acetadote1, cumberland pharmaceuticals nashville, tn)
is quickly supplanting oral formulations for all patients with
acetaminophen overdose.
under normal conditions of therapeutic dosing, acetaminophen is metabolized primarily via glucuronidation and sulfation
to nontoxic excretable metabolites, with only minimal production of the toxic intermediate, n-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine
(napqi) via the p450 enzyme system ( xxxg589xxx  isoform).
however, in overdose, both the absolute amount and proportion
of acetaminophen converted to napqi is increased. this

new and novel antidotes in pediatrics

toxicity of oral nac is largely limited to its ability to cause
gastrointestinal upset caused by its foul odor and poor
palatability. there have been no reported fatalities from oral
nac, even in massive overdose. in contrast, intravenous
nac causes systemic anaphylactoid reactions in up to 23%
of the patients;8,9 this has been fatal in patients with
preexisting bronchospasm.10,11 these reactions are more
frequent when the oral formulation is administered intravenously and may be rate related, although this is controversial.9 also, overdose deaths have occurred, usually because
of dosing errors when the recommendations for volume of
5% dextrose in water (d5w) diluent were mistaken for dose
of nac. in a young child, this led to seizures, cerebral
edema, and death.12
one last safety and administration issue with intravenous nac is of particular pediatric importance. the original
manufacturerâ€™s labeling for intravenous nac administration
involved varying a weight-based dose of drug within a
standard volume of d5w recommended for each infusion.
to avoid dosage errors which have resulted in the administration of large volumes of hypotonic fluid and hyponatremic
seizures in children, the administration of a standard 3% or
4% solution of nac in d5w throughout the treatment, with
infusion rates adjusted based upon the dose of nac desired,
has been recommended.13 â€“ 15 also, the manufacturer has
recently released additional weight-based recommendations
for pediatric use.13
health care providers prescribing intravenous nac for
acetaminophen-poisoned children should be knowledgeable
regarding its indications, proper administration, length of
therapy, and potential side effects. the loading dose should
only be provided in settings capable of treating severe
anaphylactoid reactions. in these settings, intravenous nac
seems to be both effective and safe in children as an alternative
to oral nac. the commercially available formulation of
intravenous nac is available in 30-ml vials as a 20% sterile
solution.

the cornerstone of therapy for toxic alcohol ingestion
has traditionally been hemodialysis, usually instituted for
patients with levels of more than 25 to 50 mg/dl, with
refractory acidosis or with signs of end organ toxicity.
however, extracorporeal removal via the dialysis circuit is
not instantaneous, and ongoing production of toxic metabolites will continue until dialysis is completeâ€”a process that
takes several hours. blockade of hepatic adh blunts the
production of toxic metabolites. this has historically been
done through ethanol infusion; adh has a much higher
affinity for ethanol than either methanol or ethylene glycol, so
almost no toxic metabolite can be formed when sufficient
blood ethanol levels exist. however, this therapy is difficult to
administer. a therapeutic level of 100 mg/dl or better is
necessary to fully engage the enzyme, and pharmacokinetic
variability exists between individuals. ethanol is also removed
by hemodialysis and must be accounted for when dialysis
regimens are conceived. in addition, ethanol infusions are
hyperosmolar (a 10% solution = 1800 mosm/l), so central
venous access is often ideal. lastly, ethanol has its own side
effect profile, so intoxication is expected; obtundation can
occur, and among pediatric patients, hypoglycemia and
hypothermia are further concerns.
 xxxd2148xxx  ( xxxd2148xxx ;  xxxd2148xxx , orphan medical/
jazz pharmaceuticals, palo alto, ca) is a competitive adh
inhibitor, which has an even greater affinity for the enzyme than ethanol. several trials have demonstrated its
efficacy in adult patients in the reduction of toxic metabolites,
organ toxicity, and acidosis. most of these patients also
underwent hemodialysis. there were no adverse events
reported from  xxxd2148xxx  therapy.16 â€“ 19 this efficacy and
safety profile has been substantiated by case reports
in pediatrics, although no formal studies have been published.20 â€“ 22 although it is suggested that  xxxd2148xxx  may
render dialysis unnecessary in certain toxic alcohol and glycol
poisoning cases,18,23 this has not been formally evaluated.
 xxxd2148xxx  ( xxxd2148xxx ) is available in 1.5 ml (1 g/ml)
preservative-free vials for intravenous use, which must be
diluted in at least 100 ml of either sterile saline or sterile
d5w in water for infusion. an initial loading dosage of
15 mg/kg for 30 minutes, followed by 10 mg/kg every
12 hours for the first 4 doses, is recommended.24 because
 xxxd2148xxx  is metabolized via the cytochrome p450 system,
autoinduction occurs and subsequent dosages should be
15 mg/kg every 12 hours.  xxxd2148xxx  is cleared via hemodialysis, so schedule adjustment is necessary; detailed instructions can be obtained on the manufacturerâ€™s package
insert.24 it is recommended that  xxxd2148xxx  therapy be
continued until patientsâ€™ serum levels are below 20 mg/dl,
and there is no lingering metabolic derangement. an oral
formulation of  xxxd2148xxx  exists but is not commercially
available in the united states.

 xxxd2148xxx 
methanol and ethylene glycol are found in a number of
household products including antifreeze, windshield wiper
fluid, canned heating fuel, and deicing products. adolescent
patients may be exposed to these chemicals via intentional
overdose, and young children are susceptible to curiositydriven exposures. such pediatric exposures may be at higher
risk when these hazardous chemicals are placed in vessels
other than their original containers, such as drinking cups and
bottles. as little as 1 ml/kg or half an ounce in a 3-year-old
child can be lethal. hepatic  xxxg110xxx  (adh),
which is responsible for metabolism of ethanol, isopropanol,
and  xxxd3034xxx  as well, catalyzes the first step in the
metabolism of methanol to  xxxd2154xxx  and ethylene glycol to
glycolic and  xxxd2802xxx . these by-products are highly toxic
with specific and potentially irreversible target organ toxicity:
 xxxd2154xxx  causes retinal and central nervous system injury,
and  xxxd2802xxx  precipitates as renal tubular crystals causing
renal failure. all 3 metabolites cause profound elevated anion
gap metabolic acidosis.

indigenous to the continental united states (except maine).25
it is estimated that 7000 to 8000 human snake envenomations occur within the united states each year.26 signs
and symptoms of crotaline envenomation are presented in
table 3. children are at high risk of morbidity after
envenomation; death, although rare, is often associated with
a delay in or insufficient dosing of antivenom therapy.27
for several decades, antivenin (crotalidae) polyvalent
(wyeth pharmaceuticals, madison, nj) had been the primary antivenom available for the treatment of us pit
viper envenomation. this horse-derived antivenom was very
effective, but as a whole antibody immunoglobulin g preparation, it was complicated by high rates of anaphylaxis and
serum sickness. since the year 2000, a novel crotalidae
polyvalent immune fab (fabav, crofab [savage laboratories, melville, ny]) has been supplanting the use of the
wyeth product.
fabav is produced by inoculating sheep with the
venom proteins from the eastern diamondback, western
diamondback, and mojave rattlesnakes and from the cottonmouth. the less immunogenic but more antigen-specific fab
fragments are then purified from the harvested immunoglobulinsâ€”similar to the process used for the more widely
familiar digoxin poisoning antidote. fabav has been demonstrated to reduce the severity of envenomation illness
related to coagulation, central nervous system function, and
cardiovascular performance.28 clinical experience also suggests that it halts the progression of local tissue inflammation.
in general, antivenom is indicated in cases of pit viper
envenomation complicated by progressive extension of local
tissue injury, coagulopathy, or cardiovascular instability. it is
most effective when first administered within 6 hours of
snakebite. fabav is a lyophilized antivenom that must be
reconstituted for administration. treatment is initiated by
administering 4 to 6 vials of antivenom, diluted into 250 ml
of crystalloid (delivering 25 ml/kg of fluid to a child
weighing 10 kg), for an hour in a medical setting prepared to
respond to severe anaphylactoid shock. typically, the
infusion is run slowly (ie, 25 â€“50 ml/hr) for the first

10 minutes, then advanced if no adverse reactions occur. if
physical signs of envenomation are not adequately controlled, the antivenom dose should be repeated. once
satisfactory control of the envenomation syndrome has been
achieved, additional 2 vial doses are recommended at 6, 12,
and 18 hours to ameliorate recurrence of venom effect. the
rates of anaphylaxis and serum sickness with fabav seem to
be significantly lower than the one seen with the horsederived antivenom.26 patients allergic to papaya or papain
may be at higher risk of allergic reaction to fabav. clinical
experience with the use of fabav in young children has
been mounting and seems to be favorable.29 of note, crofab
is prepared with a thimerosal preservative which may
provide up to 105 mg of ethyl mercury per vial.30 the
treatment of snakebite envenomation with antivenom is
medically complex and is best performed by practitioners
familiar with snakebite treatment or with access to a consulting medical toxicologist.

octreotide
the sulfonylurea class of oral hypoglycemic drugs
( xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , and chlorpropramide) are
used widely in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are
responsible for approximately 4000 poisoning exposures
each year.1 these drugs can be harmful in small doses; the
ingestion of even one pill can lead to prolonged hypoglycemia in children.31 by binding the sulfonylurea receptor on
the pancreatic beta cell, these agents stimulate insulin release
and, in nondiabetic patients, may cause prolonged hypoglycemia. the mainstay of treatment in these patients has been
intravenous dextrose, often at very high infusion rates and
concentrations. this is frequently complicated by the need
for central venous access and rebound hypoglycemic episodes presumably from dextrose-induced stimulation of
further insulin release.
octreotide is a long-acting synthetic octapeptide analogue of the hormone somatostatin that has been used to
treat a wide variety of disorders, including acromegaly,
congenital hyperinsulinism, esophageal varices, secretory
diarrhea, and carcinoid tumors.32 in hyperinsulinemic states,
such as sulfonylurea overdose, octreotide binds the beta cell
at the somatostatin receptor to block further insulin release.
it has been used successfully in patients with congenital
hyperinsulinism for some time,33,34 but its use in oral hypoglycemic overdose is a recent development. in sulfonylureapoisoned adults, octreotide decreases the number of episodes
of hypoglycemia and the intravenous dextrose requirement
when compared with  xxxd1868xxx  therapy or dextrose infusion
alone.35,36 pediatric data are starting to emerge, demonstrating similar efficacy.37,38
octreotide also seems to be effective in treating
hypoglycemia from quinine antimalarials.39 efficacy in
overdoses from other oral hypoglycemic agents ( xxxd3098xxx ,
 xxxd2702xxx , thiazolidinediones) has not been evaluated.
although significant adverse effects with chronic octreotide
therapy include cardiac conduction abnormalities and biliary
tract disease, adverse effects with short-term use are mild
and include vomiting, diarrhea, and steatorrhea.

new and novel antidotes in pediatrics

octreotide ( xxxd2770xxx , novartis pharmaceuticals,
basel, switzerland) is supplied in single-dose preservativefree ampules (50 â€“ 500 mg/ml) or multidose vials (200 â€“
1000 mg/5 ml) of octreotide acetate solution, which can be
given via subcutaneous injection, rapid intravenous push,
or infusion in either saline or dextrose solution for 15 to
30 minutes.40 the long-acting depot form, intended for
monthly dosing, is not appropriate in this setting. the
recommended dosage is 4 to 5 mg/kg per day (50 mg/dose in
adults) divided every 6 to 8 hours. patients can then be slowly
weaned off the supplemental intravenous dextrose infusions
as tolerated. before discharge, these patients should be able to
tolerate a moderate fast at least 6 to 8 hours after the last
octreotide dose.

antidotal therapy consists of large doses of atropine, used
for its antimuscarinic effects, and pralidoxime chloride,
which reactivates acetylcholinesterase. atropine counteracts
bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, bradycardia, and gastrointestinal effects of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cramps and may
lessen seizure activity. however, atropine will not improve
skeletal muscle paralysis. the recommended dose is 0.05
mg/kg (minimum dose, 0.1 mg; maximum dose, 5 mg)
intravenously (iv) or intramuscularly (im) for moderate to
severe toxicity, which can be repeated every 2 to 5 minutes
as needed to reverse bronchospasm and excess respiratory
secretions.
pralidoxime cleaves the organophosphate from the
cholinesterase and is able to regenerate the intact enzyme if
aging has not occurred. the effect is observed predominantly
at the neuromuscular junction, with improved muscle
strength. pralidoxime, in doses of 25 mg/kg iv or im
(maximum dose, 1 g iv or 2 g im), is recommended
promptly in all serious cases, with concomitant atropine
treatment. this can be repeated in 30 to 60 minutes for
severe cases and then again every hour for 1 or 2 additional
doses in cases with persistent weakness or high atropine
requirement.
atropine and 2-pam are optimally administered intravenously. however, intravenous atropine may provoke
arrhythmias in hypoxic animals; so, if possible, hypoxia
should be corrected, otherwise intramuscular use is preferable initially.42 in all cases, the intramuscular route is
acceptable if intravenous access is not readily available, as
could well be the case in a pediatric mass casualty incident.
most us emergency medical systems now stock
intramuscular autoinjector kits of atropine and 2-pam, and
there is experimental evidence of their safe use in adults
(primarily in us army soldiers).49 these devices are springloaded injectors that can be easily used by nonmedical
personnel. many clinicians are familiar with the identical
technology used in an epinephrine autoinjector or â€˜â€˜epipenâ€™â€™.
autoinjectors inject medication more forcefully than traditional needle and syringe intramuscular injections, with
enhanced rate of absorption (2-pam) and onset of clinical
effects (atropine) observed.49 at present, there is little actual
clinical experience to draw from regarding autoinjector
therapy for military or civilian mass casualty exposures to
nerve agent, let alone pediatric experience. however, in dire
circumstances, these autoinjectors would seem to be the
optimal route of rapid antidote administration in children.
the atropine injector (atropen1) is recently approved by
the fda for pediatric use in just this context and is
manufactured in 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg doses, in addition to
the adult dose of 2 mg (tables 4, 5). the atropen delivers
1 dose only in a total volume of up to 0.7 ml and is
nonrefillable. it uses a 22-gauge needle that delivers the
medication in a circular field of distribution from 0.2- to
0.78-inch depth of insertion. the device is deployed by
applying steady pressure at a 90-degree angle to the anterolateral thigh (vastus lateralis) for 10 seconds. in thin or
small children, the muscle mass may be grasped and slightly
pinched to provide a thicker area of injection, although

nerve agent antidotes: atropine and
2-pam autoinjectors
the nerve agent class of military chemical weapons
are organophosphorus compounds, potent inhibitors of
acetylcholinesterase similar to the organophosphate insecticides.41 â€“ 43 after exposure, the inhibition of these agents
becomes irreversible after a variable period, a process termed
aging. this is relevant because, in a mass casualty scenario,
the ability to rapidly treat a large number of critical patients
in the field or early after arrival at a hospital may result
initially in many lives saved and, in addition, considerably
less long-term morbidity if treatment can be provided before
the aging phenomenon. the current threat of terrorism and
the potential use of such potent toxic agents as terrorist
weapons have resulted in the search for management strategies that would allow for the rapid treatment of mass casualties from these agents.44
nerve agent â€“ induced anticholinesterase effects result
in accumulation of acetylcholine at neural junctions, resulting initially in stimulation of cholinergic transmission;
at the neuromuscular junction of somatic nerves, this initial
stimulation is followed shortly by paralysis. the resulting
cholinergic syndrome is classically divided into central,
nicotinic (neuromuscular junction and sympathetic ganglia),
and muscarinic (smooth muscle and exocrine gland) effects.
the clinical presentation in a given patient will depend
on dose and route of exposure.41,42 for vapor exposures,
mild toxicity would manifest with eye findings (particularly miosis and dimmed vision), rhinorrhea, mild dyspnea,
and wheezing. as dose increases, respiratory findings
worsen; nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness are expected.
exposure to very high vapor concentrations would result in
rapid onset of paralysis and seizures; death caused by
respiratory arrest may occur within minutes. children may
be more susceptible because of heavier exposure (living
â€˜â€˜closer to the groundâ€™â€™; all nerve agents are heavier than air),
higher minute ventilation, and possibly greater susceptibility
to central nervous system manifestations.45 â€“ 48
an overall treatment approach for these agents focuses
on airway and ventilatory support, aggressive use of antidotes, prompt control of seizures (or even empirical benzodiazepine therapy in severe cases before seizures have
occurred), and decontamination provided as necessary.

conversion of the intended intramuscular injection to a subcutaneous one must be avoided. the needle remains visible
after the drug is dispensed and should be disposed of carefully.
pediatric-sized 2-pam autoinjectors are not currently
available, but these are expected to win fda approval in the

foreseeable future. even the adult-intended 2-pam injectors
(600 mg) might be useful in children aged 2 to 3 years or
older or weighing 13 kg (table 4). for infants, one might
consider using the adult 2-pam autoinjector as a convenient
source of concentrated (300 mg/ml) 2-pam solution

new and novel antidotes in pediatrics

suitable for needle and syringe intramuscular injection. this
can be done by discharging one or more autoinjector
contents into an emptied 10-ml sterile saline vial and then
withdrawing the solution through a filter needle into syringes
suitable for small volume intramuscular injections.50
of note, israel has, for some years, provided autoinjectors of atropine and an oxime similar to 2-pam to all its
citizens, intended for self-use in a time of war or terrorist
context. during the 1990â€“ 1991 gulf war, 240 israeli
children, none of whom were exposed to nerve agent, were
evaluated for accidental autoinjection of atropine.51 doses
were up to 17 times the dose recommended for age. systemic
anticholinergic effects occurred in almost half of the victims;
but seizures, severe dysrhythmias, and deaths were not
observed. thus, autoinjected atropine, even in high doses
and in the absence of nerve agent toxicity, was fairly well
tolerated in this pediatric cohort.

conclusions
pediatric emergency care providers should be familiar
with intravenous nac,  xxxd2148xxx , octreotide, and crotalidae polyvalent immune fab; as pediatric poisoning and
envenomation caused by acetaminophen, methanol, ethylene
glycol, sulfonylureas, and snakebites are common. hopefully, use of atropine and 2-pam autoinjectors for mass
casualty incidents will not be necessary, but preparation
is key.
several other new and novel antidotes are on the
horizon of pediatric emergency care.  xxxd2300xxx 
is under investigation in europe for cyanide poisoning,
especially that associated with smoke inhalation in house
fires.52 insulin/glucose therapy has been advocated as a
treatment for cardiovascular depression from calcium channel blocker toxicity.53,54  xxxd1785xxx  may help ameliorate the signs and symptoms of the serotonin syndrome;55,56
the role of carnitine in the treatment of valproate-induced
hyperammonemic encephalopathy is being further defined.57
undoubtedly, new poisons will continue to be introduced into our environment, and new poisoning antidotes will
be developed. however, the primary prevention of pediatric
poisoning should remain the goal of primary focus. emergency department visits for potential poisoning might identify
an at-risk population and may offer an opportunity for
poisoning prevention education58 and advocacy.
