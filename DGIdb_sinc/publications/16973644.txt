effects of isoflurane and  xxxd1993xxx  on gabaa and glycine receptors contribute equally to depressant actions on spinal ventral horn neurones in rats.  volatile anaesthetics are widely used agents in clinical anaesthesia, although their mechanism of action is poorly understood. in particular, the dominant molecular mechanisms by which volatile anaesthetics depress spinal neurones and thereby mediate spinal effects such as immobility have recently become a matter of dispute. as gabaa and glycine receptors are potential candidates we investigated the impact of both receptor systems in mediating the depressant effects of isoflurane and  xxxd1993xxx  on spinal neurones in rats.
