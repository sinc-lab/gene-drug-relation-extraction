abstract
transmembrane isoforms of adenylate cyclases (ac) integrate a wide variety of extracellular signals from neurotransmitters to
morphogens and can also regulate camp production in response to calcium entry. based on observations in the barrelless mouse
strain, the  xxxg67xxx  gene ( xxxg67xxx ) was involved in the segregation of binocular retinal inputs. to determine the potential role of other ac
isoforms we localized the adcy genes in the visual centres during development, using in situ hybridization. six different ac subtypes
were found in the developing retinal ganglion cell layer (rgc;  xxxg67xxx ,  xxxg68xxx , ac3,  xxxg69xxx , ac8, and ac9), and three ac subtypes were
expressed in the central brain targets, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ( xxxg67xxx  and ac8), the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus
( xxxg68xxx  and ac8) and the superior colliculus ( xxxg67xxx ,  xxxg68xxx , ac8). using a genetic approach we tested the role of the calcium modulated
cyclases  xxxg67xxx ,  xxxg69xxx  and ac8 for the segregation retinal fibres. ipsilateral retinal axons remained exuberant in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – mice, with
overlapping retinal projections from both eyes in the superior colliculus and the visual thalamus. these abnormalities were similar to
those of barrelless mouse mutants. no abnormalities were detectable in the  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – or the ac8– ⁄ – mice. similar abnormalities were
noted in the single  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – and the  xxxg67xxx  ⁄ ac8 double-knockout mice (dko). thus, only  xxxg67xxx  is required for the maturation of the
retinal axon terminals whereas  xxxg69xxx  and ac8 are not needed. the specificity of  xxxg67xxx ¢s action is linked to its cellular localization in the
rgcs and to its distinctive functional profile, compared with the other cyclases expressed in the same cells.

introduction
in mammals, retinal inputs from both eyes terminate into distinct cell
layers in the primary visual relays, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus
(dlgn) and the superior colliculus (sc), forming the anatomical basis
of binocular vision. the development of this system has been widely
used as a model to unravel mechanisms involved in developmental
plasticity. axons arising from each retina are initially intermixed and
gradually separate from one another into complementary nonoverlapping layers. this occurs during early postnatal life in rodents (land &
lund 1979; godement et al. 1984). the eye-speciﬁc segregation in
central targets appears to be driven by spontaneous neural activity,
which exists in the retinal ganglion cells prior to the opening of the
eyes and before the maturation of the photoreceptors (maffei & galliresta, 1990, wong, 1993). within the terminal targets, segregation
involves competitive interactions among retinal afferents from both
eyes (reviewed in torborg & feller, 2005) and it is inﬂuenced by
neurotransmitters such as serotonin (mooney et al., 1998; upton et al.,
1999), glutamate (simon et al., 1992) and by neurotrophic factors
(menna et al., 2003).

camp signalling is important for the segregation of eye-speciﬁc
inputs (stellwagen et al., 1999; pham et al., 2001; ravary et al.,
2003), and could be a common downstream signal for the action of
several neurotransmitters or trophic molecules. the adenylate
cyclases (ac), the enzymes that produce camp from atp, exist in
at least ten different isoforms (nine transmembrane ac and one
cytoplasmic ac), which are all expressed in the brain. each isoform
has unique regulatory properties, being modulated by g-proteins
(gas, gai, gbc or gq), by ca++, or by a combination of both
signals (hanoune et al., 2001). in a mouse strain that carries a
spontaneous invalidating mutation of the  xxxg67xxx  gene, the barrelless
mutation (welker et al., 1996; abdel-majid et al., 1998), we
previously established the role of  xxxg67xxx  for the normal separation of
the ipsi- and contralateral retinal axons and for the reﬁnement of the
retinotopic map (ravary et al., 2003, nicol et al., 2006). likewise,
excessive stimulation of the  xxxg1109xxx , which is negatively
coupled to adenylate cyclase via g-proteins of the gai subtype (lin
et al., 2002), prevents the segregation of binocular inputs, possibly
by modulating camp signals. camp-mediated signalling can in turn
control numerous developmental processes such as gene transcription, via creb (pham et al., 2001), spontaneous neural activity
(stellwagen et al., 1999), synaptic plasticity (villacres et al., 1998;
wong et al., 1999), or responses of retinal axons to guidance
molecules (song et al., 1998; nicol et al., 2006). all these cellular

effects may contribute to the separation of eye-speciﬁc inputs during
the critical period of development.
in the barrelless mouse strain carrying a loss of function of the  xxxg67xxx 
gene, enzymatic measures of ac activity in the retina and the superior
colliculus showed that the global capacity of camp production, as
measured after  xxxd1742xxx  stimulation, was not modiﬁed, and that the
ca++ stimulated cyclase activity was reduced only by 50% (ravary
et al., 2003). a residual cyclase activity was also noted in the brain
after genetic targeting of the  xxxg67xxx  gene (wu et al., 1995), the ac8 gene
(wong et al., 1999), and even in the  xxxg67xxx  and ac8 double-knockout
mice (dko; chan et al., 2005). these observations indicate that
within a given structure there are many possible ways of producing
camp in response to a cellular signal such as ca++ ﬂuctuations.
this observation incited us to examine the presence and developmental role of the other ac in the developing visual system. we
analysed all the identiﬁed transmembrane isoforms of ac in three
locations: the retina, the lgn and the sc, spanning the developmental
period from e15 to p10, at the time when the retinal ganglion axons
reach their central targets and become restricted to limited terminal
zones. we found that  xxxg67xxx ,  xxxg68xxx ,  xxxg69xxx , and ac8 are the predominant
ac isoforms expressed in the retina or the superior colliculus during
eye-speciﬁc retinal segregation. to analyse the function of certain of
these genes we examined the organization of the retinogeniculate and
retinotectal projections in the available mouse strains in which these
genes have been invalidated, the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –,  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ –, ac8– ⁄ –, as well as
in the  xxxg67xxx  ⁄ ac8 double-knockout mice. our results indicate that only
 xxxg67xxx  has a clear role for the development of the retinal pathways by
preventing the reorganization of the retinal inputs from both eyes in
their central brain targets.

materials and methods
animals
of1 swiss mice (iffa credo) were killed at e15, p4, p10, and as adults
(2 months). e0 is the day following mating night and p0 is the day of
birth. animals were maintained on a 12-h light : 12-h dark cycle and
killed during daytime. adult and p10 mice were anaesthetized with an
overdose of pentobarbital. embryos and pups up to p4 were coldanaesthetized on ice. animal procedures were conducted in strict
compliance with approved institutional protocols and in accordance
with the provisions for animal care and use described in the scientiﬁc
procedures on living animals act 1986 (european council
directive: 86 ⁄ 609 eec). care was taken to minimize the number of
animals used for the experiments.

et al., 2003). the brl mice were maintained on two backgrounds, the
original albino background, and the c57-bl6 background (backcross
brl=brl
brl=brl
6). they will hence be termed ac1swiss , and ac1c57 , to distinguish
them from the mice with a homologous recombination in the  xxxg67xxx 
gene ( xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –). control mice of similar backgrounds were used for
each genotype.

probes
the position and the length of each probe is indicated in table 1. to
verify the speciﬁcity of each probe, their sequences were used to
blast the mouse genome using the ncbi blast server. no
signiﬁcant alignment with inappropriate sequences was found. sense
probes were systematically used in parallel with antisense probes as
controls.
the synthesis of the probes was carried out with a kit from promega
(madison, wi) using 35s-utp (> 1000 ci ⁄ mmol).
the dissected brains or whole heads were directly frozen by
immersion in cooled isopentane ()40 c). serial 20-lm-thick sections
were collected on superfrost plus glass slides (menzel-glaser,
germany) and stored in slide boxes at )80 c.
in situ hybridization followed the protocol described in nicol et al.
(2005). brieﬂy, tissue sections were postﬁxed for 15 min in 4%
paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs,
ph 7.5), acetylated, washed in pbs, dehydrated, and air-dried.
sections were covered with hybridization buffer (50% formamide,
1 mg ⁄ ml yeast trna, 0.5 mg ⁄ ml salmon sperm, denhardt’s 5·,
ssc 5·, ph 7.7) containing 106 cpm ⁄ section of the 35s-labelled  xxxg67xxx 
and ac8 probes, and incubated overnight in a humid chamber at
52 c. washes were carried out in ssc 5·, dtt 0.16% at 42 c, ssc
2· 50% formamide, dtt 1.25% at 60 c, saline 1·, rnase
20 lg ⁄ ml at 37 c, and three rinses in saline 1·, ssc 2·, and
ssc 0.1·, and dehydrated.
autoradiograms were obtained by apposing the sections to hyperﬁlm bmax (amersham, piscataway, nj) for 2–4 days. serial sections
of the four examined ages (e15, p4, p10, adult) were processed
together and exposed on the same ﬁlm. slides were then dipped in
photographic emulsion (ntb2 eastman kodak, rochester, ny),
exposed for 10–12 days. the sections were counterstained with cresyl
violet and coverslipped in cytoseal. the tissue sections were
photographed with an axiophot (zeiss, germany) photomicroscope
equipped with a photometrics camera (princeton instruments). darkﬁeld and brightﬁeld views of the emulsion-coated sections were
acquired and confronted with their nissl counterstaining.

mouse strains

quantification of in situ hybridization labelling

generation of  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –,  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – and ac8– ⁄ – has been described
previously (wu et al., 1995; okumura et al., 2003; schaefer et al.,
2000).  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –, ac8– ⁄ –, and dko  xxxg67xxx –ac8 mice were obtained
from the breeding stock of the university of washington;  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – mice
were from the breeding stock of the new jersey medical school. the
 xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – and ac8– ⁄ – strains were maintained on a c57-bl6 background, the  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – were on a mixed 129 ⁄ c57-bl6 background.
the brl mutation occurred spontaneously in the nor swiss strain
(welker et al., 1996) in a breeding stock of the anatomy department at
the university of lausanne and has been subsequently characterized
as an insertion of a retro-transposon in the  xxxg67xxx  gene (abdel-majid
et al., 1998). the loss of  xxxg67xxx  function in this mouse strain was shown
by the reduction of calcium-stimulated ac activity in total brain
extracts (abdel-majid et al., 1998), in the sc and in the retina (ravary

to estimate the quantity of radioactive probe hybridized we estimated
the density of silver grain accumulations from the emulsion coated
sections. darkﬁeld micrographs were acquired with a leica photomicroscope ( ·20 objective, ﬁnal magniﬁcation of ·100), the image
focus was placed at the level of the emulsion, that overlies the tissue
sections, so as to acquire an image in which only the silver grains are
in focus. the illumination and acquisition parameters were ﬁxed
throughout the acquisition procedure. the digital images were then
normalized with image j software using the following sequence:
substract background function (roller ball 50 pixel diameter); normalization of the grey value of the image from 0 to 255; thresholding of
silver grain labelling (threshold set to 70–80). this procedure allowed
us to obtain a binary image with only the silver grains. the size of a
silver grain in this image varied between 3 and 20 pixels (mean

10 pixels). however, because silver grains tend to coalesce into
clusters, particle analysis was not feasible. we therefore measured the
surface of the thresholded pixels (from the normalized image of the
silver grains) within a ﬁxed surface area. for this purpose, a selection
area consisting of a circle of diameter 70 lm was drawn over the
image, the size was chosen to ﬁt in the smallest structure analysed (the
retinal ganglion cell layer). the circle selection was then placed over
different areas in the section in order to sample the different areas of
interest, i.e. the background (measured for each section), the retinal
ganglion cell layer (rgc), the dlgn, the ventro lateral geniculate
nucleus (vlgn), and the upper layers of the sc. four to six measures
were taken from each section and three to four different sections were
analysed for each age (e15, p4, p10, adult), for each structure, and for
each probe. the mean pixels ⁄ unit surface and sem was calculated for
each area of interest, and subtracted from the mean background level
for each area of interest. this value provides an approximation of the
silver grain density that is related to the radioactive signal. for
statistical comparisons of age related changes of acs in each structure
we used the two-way analysis of variance (anova) and the unpaired
student’s t-test.

anterograde tracing of retinal axons
in ﬁve mice of each genotype, alexa 488 conjugated to cholera toxin
subunit b (ctb; molecular probes, eugene, or) was injected into
one eye and alexa 594 ctb was injected into the other eye. the
tracers were diluted (3 mg ⁄ ml) in 0.8% saline and 20% sucrose. one
to three microliters of this solution were injected into each eye. after a
2-day survival, the mice were perfused and the brains were postﬁxed
overnight, cryoprotected (30% sucrose in phosphate buffer) and
serially cut on a freezing microtome to 40-lm-thick sections. the
sections were mounted in mowiol.

quantification
only cases with complete retinal ﬁlls (3–4 cases for each genotype)
were used for the quantiﬁcation of the retinal projections. the quality
of the ﬁll was assessed by the fact that the intensity of the label and the
fact that the contours of the contralateral retinal projection matched
precisely those of the dlgn borders. fluorescence microscopy was
performed on a leica microscope equipped with ﬂuorescein and
rhodamine ﬁlter sets and with a coolsnap ccd camera (princeton
instruments). digital images of all the sections in the coronal series
were acquired with a leica photomicroscope (20· objective) equipped
with the metamorph acquisition software and a photometrics camera
(princeton instruments). the exposition time was ﬁxed for all the
sections within one series. the sections were number-coded so that the

observer was unaware of the genotype. digital images were acquired
for each ﬁlter set for all the sections through the dlgn and the sc for
qualitative observations. to measure the surface occupied by the
ipsilateral and contralateral projections the procedure described in
muir-robinson et al. (2002) was used. three sections localized at the
mid-level of the dlgn, were selected. to normalize the digital
images, the following sequence was used on the image j software:
substract background with a roller ball diameter of 50; 0–255
normalization of the image. on these images the contours of the dlgn
were delimited from the image of the contralateral projection. care
was taken to exclude the overlying ﬁbre tracts and the intergeniculate
leaﬂet. then, the ipsi- and contralateral were binarized creating images
in which the value of each pixel is set to 0 if it is under the threshold
and 1 if above. this allowed the measurement of the number of pixels
corresponding to the ipsilateral projection contained within the
contour of the dlgn; the percentage of dlgn surface occupied
was then calculated. to measure the degree of overlap between the ipsi
and contralateral projection, the value of each pixel (1 or 0) from the
ipsilateral image was multiplied by the corresponding pixel value from
the contralateral image. the product of this operation is an image
where the value of each pixel is 1 if the ipsi- and the contralateral
overlap, and 0 if they do not. then, on this product image, the number
of pixels (pixel whose value is 1) is an estimate of the fraction of the
overlapping ipsi- and contralateral axons within the dlgn area. this
analysis was performed using the metamorph software.
to provide a quantitative description of the ipsilateral retinal
projections in the sc, the dorsoventral extent of the retinal axons was
quantiﬁed as follows. the digitized images were obtained from four
consecutive coronal sections in the rostral colliculus at a 20·
objective. two zones were delimited in the sc, an upper layer,
corresponding to the stratum griseum superﬁciale (sgs) and a ventral
layer corresponding to the stratum opticum (so). the area occupied
by the ipsilateral (red ﬁlter) or the contralateral retinal axons (green
ﬁlter) was measured for each of these zones, after thresholding the
ctb labelled axons as described above. the same ﬁxed threshold was
used for all the cases.
comparisons of these measures among genotypes used the one-way
analysis of variance.

separated by a cell sparse inner plexiform layer. the labelling of the outer ﬁbre layer of the retina, the sclera (scl) is artifactual and is due to light refraction that is

fig. 3. quantiﬁcation of ac gene expression in the rgcs, lgn, and sc during development. to indicate the general trend of developmental changes in ac
expression in the visual pathway, measures of silver grain densities were carried out in the retinal ganglion cell layer (a) at e15, p4, p10 and adult, for the  xxxg67xxx , the
 xxxg68xxx , ac3,  xxxg69xxx , ac8 and ac9 probes. (b–d) measures in the dlgn, the vlgn and the sc were carried out at e15, p4, p10 and adult, for the  xxxg67xxx , the  xxxg68xxx , and
ac8 probes. each value corresponds to the mean ± sem of 10–15 measures, from which the background noise, measured for each section, was subtracted. the
measures are given in pixels per unit surface. this corresponds to the pixels measured after thresholding of silver grain labelling (mean silver grain size ¼ 10 pixels)
within a ﬁxed surface area (3848 lm2 ¼ 13300 pixels). the expression is considered to be signiﬁcant when the signal is twice the background (the mean background
is of 300 pixels ⁄ unit surface). using anova, the effect of age on total variance of gene expression was signiﬁcant in all cases, except for  xxxg68xxx  in the dlgn. anova
was used to compare changes in gene expression between e15 and p0; p0 and p4; p4 and p10; p10 and adults, for each gene and for each structure: *p < 0.05;
**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. similar signiﬁcance values were obtained with student’s unpaired t-test (not shown).

rgcs (fig. 1a, a¢, b, b¢, c, c¢, d and d¢). quantiﬁcation of the
 xxxg67xxx  mrna signal indicated a maximal expression at e15.5 and p4,
with a non-signiﬁcant decline of expression at p10 and a signiﬁcant
reduction of expression in the adult rgcs (fig. 3a; anova
p ¼ 0.02).  xxxg67xxx  expression was also noted in the external segment of
the photoreceptors (fig. 1c) as described previously (fukuhara
et al., 2004). however, developmental changes were not assessed in
this cell layer, because light cycle modiﬁes the  xxxg67xxx  expression in
photoreceptors (fukuhara et al., 2004). the other calcium-stimulated
cyclase, ac8, was not detected in the embryonic retina (fig. 2e), but
was noted in a subset of cells in the rgc that contained a high
density of silver grain accumulation (fig. 2f¢, g¢ and h¢). the ac8positive cells were more loosely distributed at p10 and in adult,
explaining a reduction in the global his signal in the rgc
(fig. 3a), although each cell appears to be strongly labelled. it
remains to be determined whether these cells correspond to a speciﬁc
subtype of rgcs or to displaced amacrine cells, as suggested by
their bilaminar distribution. ac8 expression was abundant in the
inl from p4 to adulthood (fig. 2f–h). ac8 therefore appears to be
an important isoform of calcium stimulated cyclase in retinal
interneurons.
two cyclases, that are inhibited by calcium, ac3 and  xxxg69xxx  (and by
gai, in the case of  xxxg69xxx ) are expressed in the rgcs during visual
development. moderate ac3 expression was detectable in the rgc at
p4, p10 and in adults (fig. 1i–l), but not at e15 (fig. 3a).  xxxg69xxx 

mrna was detected at e15 in the rgc and increased at p4, p10, with
signiﬁcantly lower expression in the adult retina (figs 2a–d and a¢–
d¢, and 3a; anova p < 0 001). expression of  xxxg69xxx  was also noted in
the interneuron cell layer during the postnatal period and in adults
(fig. 2a–d).
finally, two cyclases that are calcium insensitive but are positively
coupled to gas,  xxxg68xxx , and ac9, were found in the retina.  xxxg68xxx  mrna
was not signiﬁcantly different from background levels in the
embryonic retina, at e15, but a high signal relative to background
was noted in the rgcs from p4 up to adulthood (figs 1f–h and f¢–
h¢, and 3a).  xxxg68xxx  was also expressed in the interneuron cell layer
(fig. 1e–h) and in the onl at p4 (interneurons are not well separated
from photoreceptors at that age). ac9 mrna expression was found in
the rgcs at all ages (fig. 2i–l) but with a relatively weak expression
level, that showed little variation across developmental stages
(fig. 3a).
we did not detect any expression of the ac4, ac6 or ac7 genes in
the mouse retina with our probes, at any of the ages studied (results
not shown).
ac expression in the central retinal targets
from e15.5 to adulthood, we found three adenylate cyclase isoforms
of ( xxxg67xxx ,  xxxg68xxx , and ac8) in the main central targets of the rgcs
axons.

shown to begin very early during embryonic life, with a gradual
decrease of  xxxg67xxx  expression and an increase of ac8 expression in the
course of postnatal life (nicol et al., 2005). in the dlgn, high levels
of  xxxg67xxx  expression were noted at e15, p4, and p10 and expression
levels decreased signiﬁcantly in adults (anova p < 0.001) (figs 3c
and, 4a and d). in the vlgn that is derived from the embryonic
ventral thalamus, low  xxxg67xxx  expression was noted at embryonic and
postnatal ages whereas no signiﬁcant expression was detectable in
adults (figs 3d and 4a–d). ac8 gene expression in the dlgn was
detectable at e15, increasing at p4 and p10, and with signiﬁcantly
higher levels in the adult (fig. 4i–l). ac8 signal was also detected in
the vlgn (fig. 4j).

the developmental pattern of  xxxg68xxx  expression has not been
reported previously during development. no signiﬁcant expression of
 xxxg68xxx  was detectable in the dlgn whereas expression of  xxxg68xxx  was
noted the vlgn at postnatal stages (figs 3c and d, and 4f–h) and
in the ventral thalamus (from which the vlgn is derived) at e15
(fig. 4e).
in the sc, moderate  xxxg67xxx  gene expression was noted at e15, p4, and
p10 (figs 3b and 5a–c) whereas in adults,  xxxg67xxx  expression was not
detectable (figs 3b and 5d). in contrast,  xxxg68xxx  gene expression was
barely above background at embryonic stages and increased signiﬁcantly in the sc during the postnatal period (fig. 3b, anova
p < 0.001).  xxxg67xxx  expression was initially widespread in all the
superﬁcial and deep sc layers at p4 (fig. 5f). then, at p10, the

cholera toxin coupled to different alexa conjugates (fig. 6). alterations in the distribution of the ipsilateral retinal projections were
noted in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –, the  xxxg67xxx –ac8 dko, and the barrelless mutants.
ipsilateral axons were more broadly and diffusely distributed in the
dlgn compared to their controls. the extent of the ipsilateral retinal
projections in the dlgn was signiﬁcantly increased in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –
(29.9% ± 2.3 of the dlgn surface; fig. 6e and p), compared to the
wild-type (wt) mice (18.8% ± 0.8, anova, p ¼ 0.002; fig. 6b and
brl=brl
p). in the ac1swiss mice, the ipsilateral projection was larger
(36.9% ± 3.3) than controls (anova comparison with wt, p < 0.001)
and was also larger than the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – (p < 0.001). however, in brl
brl=brl
mice backcrossed to the c57-bl6 background, the ac1c57; quantitative measures of the ipsilateral retinal projections showed an
increase (27.0% ± 1.2; fig. 6p) that was more similar to that of the
 xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – raised on the same c57-bl6 background. thus, the quantibrl=brl
tative difference between the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – and the ac1swiss are due to a
background effect. indeed, as the albino mice display intrinsic defects
of the uncrossed retinal projection (lavail et al., 1978), it is possible
that the two genetic deﬁciencies could potentiate one another, as
discussed in a previous study of retinal projections in the brl mutants
(ravary et al., 2003).
no modiﬁcations of retinal axon distribution were observed in the
 xxxg69xxx  knockout (ko; 19.7% ± 2.3, comparison with wt, n.s.; fig. 5j–
l) or the ac8 ko (18.3% ± 2.1; comparison with wt, n.s.; fig. 5m–
o). in the  xxxg67xxx -ac8 dko mice the abnormalities were quantitatively
comparable to those observed in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – (26.6% ± 3.1, anova
comparison with  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ –, n.s.).
a segregation of the eye-speciﬁc territories in the dlgn can occur
even when the ipsilateral retinal projections are broader or illpositioned (muir-robinson et al., 2002). to evaluate whether there is
a separation of the ipsi- and contralateral territories in the dlgn, we
estimated the surface of the dlgn that is occupied by overlapping
ipsi- and contra-lateral retinal projections on three 40-lm-thick
sections that were taken at the mid-level of the dlgn. three cases
of the six different genotypes were processed, blind to the genotype. in
wt mice the percentage of overlap of retinal ﬁbers of each eye within
brl=brl
the dlgn was minimal (0.77% ± 0.14; fig. 6c). in the ac1swiss ,
–⁄–
–⁄–
–⁄–
the  xxxg67xxx  , and the  xxxg67xxx  ⁄ ac8
mice, the area of overlap
brl=brl
increased signiﬁcantly (ac1swiss , 8.34% ± 1.12;  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – 6.99% ±
0.49;  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – ⁄ ac8– ⁄ – 6.26% ± 0.06, fig. 6q).
thus, a secondary segregation of the binocular inputs does not
occur in the  xxxg67xxx  deﬁcient mice contrarily to what has been described
in other mutants, and the changes are more severe in the barrelless
swiss strain than in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – mice.
no changes were noted in the  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – and the ac8– ⁄ – mice ( xxxg69xxx –
⁄–
0.57% ± 0.06; ac8– ⁄ – 0.79 ± 0.2 of overlapping axons, fig. 6q).
exuberance of retinal projections in the sc in  xxxg67xxx  deficient
mice, but not in  xxxg69xxx  ko and ac8 ko
in rodents, the uncrossed retino-tectal projection arises from the
ventro-temporal portion of the retina (drager & olsen 1980). in the
sc, these ipsilateral retinal axons are initially diffuse in the whole
thickness of the sc but then become conﬁned to the deeper layer of
the sc, the stratum opticum (so), where they form series of clusters
aligned along the medio-lateral dimension in the rostral portion of the
sc, and are excluded from the upper stratum griseum superﬁciale
(sgs; godement et al., 1984; upton et al., 1999; and see fig. 7a–c).
we measured the fraction of labelled ipsilateral axons that are
located in the so (the normal target) vs. the sgs (exuberant axons;
fig. 7p). in the wt mice, 95.2% ± 1.8 of the ipsilateral axons were
concentrated in the so, 4.8% ± 1.8 being in the sgs (fig. 6a–c). in

brl=brl

the ac1swiss mice, 48.9% ± 0.6 of the ipsilateral axons were found in
the sgs (anova comparison with wt; p ¼ 0.002; fig. 7g–i). in the
 xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – and the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – ⁄ ac8– ⁄ – double knock-out mice, 29.2% ± 3.0
and 29.3 ± 1.7 of the ipsilateral axons are present in the sgs (anova
comparison with wt; p ¼ 0.04; fig. 6d–f). in contrast, the
ipsilateral axons are restricted to the so in the  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – (fig. 6j–l)
and the ac8– ⁄ – (fig. 6m–o) mice as in the wt (5.5% ± 0.7 and
6.5% ± 0.4 of ipsilateral axons in the so; anova comparisons n.s.).
thus,  xxxg67xxx , is required for a normal laminar reﬁnement of the retinocollicular projection and for the retraction of exuberant ipsilateral
retinal axons from the caudal sc, and from the sgs, whereas  xxxg69xxx  or
ac8 are not required.

discussion
our study shows that several isoforms of acs are expressed in the
developing retina and in retinal brain targets, the lgn and the sc.
these cyclases have diverse modes of regulation and could be
required for different developmental functions. based on the present
analysis in mice with a genetic invalidation of three of these cyclases,
we show that  xxxg67xxx , but not ac8, or  xxxg69xxx , is required for the
reﬁnement of the retinal axon terminals in central brain targets.
multiple ac isoforms in the retina camp signalling plays an
important role in the development of the retina from cell survival to
growth and differentiation, but very little is known about the speciﬁc
roles of the ac isotypes, which synthesize camp in response to
 xxxg89xxx  activation or increases of calcium. data on
the localization of ac isoforms in the adult retina are scant and
somewhat divergent (xia et al., 1993; beitz et al., 1998; abdel-majid
et al., 2002; fukuhara et al., 2004), and, to the best of our knowledge,
no developmental analysis is available. the present analysis indicates
that each differentiating cell type of the neuroretina expresses one or a
combination of ac isotypes. the rgcs, which differentiate ﬁrst,
begin by expressing  xxxg67xxx ,  xxxg69xxx , and ac9 and subsequently,  xxxg68xxx , ac3,
and ac8 as they mature during the postnatal period. the distribution
of these genes suggests that they may be coexpressed within single
rgcs. however, given the multiplicity of rgc subtypes, it cannot be
excluded that one ac isotype may be preferentially enriched in a
given category of rgcs. the interneuron layer, which is the second to
differentiate from the neuroblastic layer during early postnatal life,
expresses abundantly  xxxg68xxx ,  xxxg69xxx  and ac8. as this cell layer is
particularly heterogeneous, the question of a possible colocalization of
these three genes awaits further histological analysis, using cell-type
speciﬁc markers for the amacrine, and bipolar cell types. interestingly,
the spatial distribution of ac8, with bi-stratiﬁed localization in the
amacrine and rgc cell layer, is reminiscent of that of the starburst
amacrine cells (hansen et al., 2005), and it will be of interest to
determine whether ac8 is enriched in this cell category. in the
photoreceptor layer, which differentiates last in ontogenesis, we could
detect only  xxxg67xxx . this is in agreement with previous observations in
the rat retina (xia et al., 1993; fukuhara et al., 2004), indicating that
 xxxg67xxx  may modulate directly the photoreceptor cells in addition to its
role in the rgcs. interestingly,  xxxg67xxx -dependent pathways contribute
to the modulation of the retinal response to light (tremblay et al.,
2002).
our ﬁnding that a variety of cyclases are expressed in the
neuroretina during the early postnatal period, explains why  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cyclase activity is not modiﬁed in the retina of the ac1deﬁcient mice (ravary et al., 2003). moreover, the presence of the
other ca++ modulated cyclases, such as ac8, explains why the
calcium-stimulated cyclase activity is only reduced by 50%. the fact
that ac8 does not compensate for the  xxxg67xxx  loss of function could

further be explained by a differential cellular localization of  xxxg67xxx ,
which is essentially in the rgcs, while ac8 is essentially enriched in
the retinal interneurons.
a particular mention should be made of our observation of an  xxxg69xxx 
expression in the retina. this cyclase is negatively modulated by
calcium and is important for modulating the camp responses, in
conjunction with calcium stimulated cyclase in the heart (okumura
et al., 2003). in the central nervous system,  xxxg69xxx  was previously noted
to be essentially localized in the striatum, where it plays an important
role for the adenosine (a2b) and dopamine (d2) receptor signalling
pathways and is required for the neuroleptic effects of antipsychotic
drugs (lee et al., 2002). the present description suggests that in
addition,  xxxg69xxx  could play important roles in the retina at different
stages of visual signalling.

transmembrane  xxxg67xxx  and  xxxg69xxx  are not required for the early
development of the visual pathways
camp is an important second messenger during the initial guidance of
the retinal axons within the visual pathways. in xenopus, the
formation of the optic nerve is conditioned by variations of camp
in the retinal axons; the axons are initially attracted to netrin 1 in the
optic nerve when camp levels are high, and then become repelled by
netrin, as camp levels decrease (shewan et al., 2002; hopker et al.,
1999).  xxxg2067xxx , which constrains the growth of rgcs within
the optic chiasm in chicks, is thought to act via camp signalling
(trousse et al., 2001). finally numerous in vitro studies implicate
camp in the growth and survival of the rgcs (rehen et al., 1996;
meyer-franke et al., 1998).
based on the present observations, only three ac isotypes,  xxxg67xxx ,
 xxxg69xxx , and ac9 are expressed early enough to subserve such
functions. intriguingly however, there are no obvious alterations of
the visual tract in the ac1brl ⁄ brl (ravary et al., 2003; tremblay
et al., 2002) nor in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – or the  xxxg69xxx – ⁄ – mice (present
observations). perhaps the loss of one ac isoform is not sufﬁcient
to cause axon growth defects in the embryonic retina, one ac being
able to compensate for the other. alternatively, the soluble isoform
of ac (ac10) (chen et al., 2000), or the depolarization activated
residual cyclase activity found in the  xxxg67xxx –ac8 dko neurons
(chan et al., 2005), which were not investigated in the present
study, may be expressed in the rgcs at these early times. these
two cyclase activities are particularly interesting given that both are
stimulated by calcium. moreover, recent observations indicate a role
of the soluble adenylate cyclase in axon guidance (wu et al., 2006).
it will thus be necessary to invalidate all these ac isoforms to
determine whether or not camp signalling is required in vivo for
the early guidance of the retinal axons in mice, as suggested by
previous experiments in other species.

 xxxg67xxx  is required for target selection of retino-collicular and
retino-thalamic projections
similar to the previous observation in the barrelless mutant mice,
the present observations in the  xxxg67xxx – ⁄ – and  xxxg67xxx –ac8 dko mice
directly indicate that  xxxg67xxx  is required for the separation of eyespeciﬁc retinal inputs in the dlgn and the sc. separation of the
ipsi- and contralateral retinal axon arbors occurs during postnatal
life, from p3 to p8, after the retinal axons have invaded their
targets. this reﬁnement is driven by spontaneous neural activity in
the retina and it is abolished by silencing activity in the retina or in
central targets (mclaughlin et al., 2003; reviewed in torborg &

feller, 2005). camp regulates the spontaneous waves of activity in
the retina (stellwagen et al., 1999) but it is difﬁcult to predict from
these studies which of the six isotypes of ac identiﬁed in the
retina, is responsible for these effects. the calcium-stimulated
cyclases  xxxg69xxx  and ac8 appears as interesting candidates as ac8
expression begins at the same time as the emergence of spontaneous
neural activity (feller et al., 1996), and  xxxg69xxx  is a preferred
signalling pathway of the a2 adenosine receptors, which modulate
the retinal activity (stellwagen et al., 1999)
surprisingly however, the loss of function of either  xxxg69xxx  or ac8,
had no consequences on the general development of the visual
pathways, and caused no measurable alterations of the eye-speciﬁc
retinal segregation. our results cannot however, exclude that loss of
 xxxg69xxx  or of ac8 function lead to more subtle phenotypes in the retina
or their brain targets, or cause functional changes that do not result in
visible consequences on retinal axon patterns.
the speciﬁcity of the action of  xxxg67xxx , was conﬁrmed here in  xxxg67xxx 
knockout mice, as compared to our previous observations in the
spontaneous barrelless mutation (ravary et al., 2003). this is an
important validation of a functional equivalence between the two
mouse strains because the transposon insertion that disrupts the  xxxg67xxx 
gene in the barrelless strain may have caused additional unrecognized changes. in addition our study showed that small quantitative
differences of phenotype between the two mouse strains reported are
linked to background effects. the speciﬁcity of  xxxg67xxx  relatively to
the other cyclases expressed in the rgcs could be due to the fact
that it lies downstream of neural activity, converting spontaneous
activity patterns to transient camp signals. we recently established
that the lack of  xxxg67xxx  prevents the normal retraction of rgc axons
in response to ephrin-a5 (nicol et al., 2006) it is therefore possible
that  xxxg67xxx  is particularly enriched in the growth cones, and that this
localization, associated to its regulation by ca++ explains its
selective role.
the fact that  xxxg68xxx  is also expressed in the rgcs during the
period of eye-speciﬁc segregation could indicate another potential
route to modulate camp in these neurons, because this cyclase is
stimulated by a variety of g-coupled receptors. indeed,  xxxg68xxx  can be
directly stimulated by gs, or indirectly by g-beta-gamma subunits
that are derived from gi ⁄ go (hanoune et al., 2001). thus, the
gi-coupled 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b receptors positively couple to
 xxxg68xxx  at least in cell lines (albert et al., 1999). as the 5-ht1b
receptor modulates the segregation of binocular retinal inputs
(salichon et al., 2001; upton et al., 2002), it is possible that  xxxg68xxx ,
rather than  xxxg67xxx , could be implicated in such effects. the lack of
genetic models for this cyclase does not however, allow to test its
selective role.

conclusion
we demonstrate that a variety of ac are present in the developing
retinal pathways, offering a wide capacity to integrate extracellular
signals and intrinsic changes of neural activity. these cyclases could
serve different purposes for the maturation of the visual pathways. at
present, of the three calcium-modulated cyclase that are found to be
expressed in the retina during the reﬁnement of retinal maps, only
 xxxg67xxx  appears to be required for the axon terminal remodelling.
