abstract the formation of inclusion bodies in dopaminergic
neurons is associated with the pathogenesis of parkinsonõs
disease. in order to clarify the role of dopamine/l-dopa in the
formation of protein aggregates, we investigated dopamine/ldopa-related aggregation using an experimental inclusion model.
the inhibition of  xxxg2276xxx  (th) by a- xxxd2634xxx 
dramatically decreased mg132-induced aggregate formation. in
addition, the inhibition of th caused the upregulation of proteasomes in cultured cells and the dopamine/l-dopa induced nonenzymatic polymerization of ubiquitin. this inhibition did not
aﬀect cell viability. these results suggest that dopamine/l-dopa
might enhance aggregate formation, and that intracellular aggregates may not be toxic to cells.

1. introduction
lewy body (lb) formation in dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra is one of the most characteristic ﬁndings in
the parkinsonõs disease (pd) brain [1]. intracellular inclusion
bodies in neurodegenerative diseases suggests the molecular
components that may be associated with the pathogenesis [1–
3]. ubiquitin and a-synuclein are well known components of
lbs and their presence implies the importance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the formation of lbs [2,4,5]. however, the formation of lbs primarily in dopaminergic
neurons has not been addressed. recent reports suggest that
a-synuclein may be toxic in dopaminergic neurons, and trophic
in non-dopaminergic neurons [6]. this toxicity may be due to
the formation of protoﬁbrils by a-synuclein, which are more
toxic than ﬁbrils, in the presence of l-dopa/dopamine [7].
although this observation may oﬀer insight into dopaminergic
neuron-speciﬁc toxicity in the pathogenesis of pd, it seems
contrary to the observation of lbs in dopaminergic neurons,
and that intracellular inclusion bodies are not toxic to the cells
[8,9].

the proteasome is a large multicatalytic protease that is
responsible for the majority of intracellular protein degradation [10,11]. the application of excess dopamine induces a
time- and dose-dependent reduction of proteasome activity
in neural pc12 cells [12]. therefore, in order to promote further understanding of aggregates and the pathogenesis of
pd, the association between l-dopa/dopamine and protein
aggregation should be examined. we hypothesized that ldopa/dopamine might aﬀect ubiquitin-proteasome system-related aggregates formation. in the present report, we examine
the association of l-dopa/dopamine with the formation of
intracellular inclusion bodies through an experimental inclusion model in pc12 cells.

3. results
3.1. characterization of the intracellular inclusion model
the proteasome inhibitor, mg132 (250 nm), induced intracellular aggregates in ngf-diﬀerentiated pc12 cells (fig. 1).
ubiquitin and a-synuclein-positive small aggregates were observed in a perinuclear region at 24 h after mg132 administration (fig. 1d–f). further, larger aggregates were observed at
48 h after mg132 administration (data not shown). these
aggregates expressed tubulin immunoreactivity (fig. 1g and
i), suggesting that they were similar in composition proteins
to aggresomes reported by kopito. as reported previously,
the number of cells containing aggregates at 24 h after
mg132 administration were 78% under 100 nm mg132 and
82% under 250 nm mg132 [8]. in this inclusion model, up
to 5% of cells show apoptotic cell death. another proteasome
inhibitor, psi (z–ile–glu(obut)–ala–leu–h(aldehyde)), also
induced similar structures (data not shown).
3.2. decreased aggregate formation by th inhibition
in this experimental model, the degree of aggregate formation diﬀered between cells. we established th-promoter (4.2
kb)-including pegfp-1 vector-transfected pc12 cells, which
can be easily assayed for th activity (fig. 2a and b). the
th expression level is diﬀerent for each cell and we investi-

2.6. analyses of proteasome and cathepsin activities
the activities of proteasome and  xxxg548xxx  were determined by
measuring the cleavage rate of z–leu–leu–leu–mca and z–arg–
arg–mca, respectively. each ﬂuorogenic substrate was prepared as
a 10 mm stock in dmso. for the analysis of proteasome activity, cultured cells (106) were lysed in proteolysis buﬀer-a (10 mm tris–hcl,
ph 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm atp, 5 mm mgcl2, and 0.1%
triton-x100) for the time indicated in the ﬁgure legend. for the analyses of cathepsin activity, cells were lysed in proteolysis buﬀer-b
(hanksõ  xxxd2988xxx  lacking sodium bicarbonate, but containing 0.6 mm cacl2, 0.6 mm mgcl2, 2 mm l-cystein, 25 mm
pipes, ph 7.0, and 0.1% triton-x100). prepared lysates and 2.5 ll
of the substrate were mixed in 96 well plate, and incubated at 37 c
for 30 min. fluorescence was measured at ex 355 nm/em 460 nm using
an arvo mx 1420 multilabel counter (perkin–elmer) and compensated by protein concentration.
2.7. in vitro aggregation analyses
for in vitro aggregation analyses, a mixture of 1 mg/ml ubiquitin, 10
mm tris–hcl, ph 7.9, and 10 lm dopamine or l-dopa was incubated
at 30 c for 12 h. polymerization of ubiquitin was detected by cbb
staining and immunoblotting using fk1 antibody.
2.8. mtt assay
for the analyses of cell viability, 5 · 103 cells in 96-well ﬂat bottomed
culture plates were subjected to an mtt assay according to the manufacturerõs protocol with some modiﬁcations. brieﬂy, treated cells were
incubated with 100 ll of mtt solution for 4 h, followed by the addition
of 100 ll of isopropylalcohol including 0.04 n hcl. after mixing thoroughly by repeated pipetting, the absorbance was measured at 600 nm.
2.9. statistical analyses
the quantitative data were assessed using anova in the statview
software system. the criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was p < 0.05.

gated what types of cells had many aggregates. interestingly, in
cells with a high egfp signal, more aggregates were formed
compared with that in low egfp-expressed cells (fig. 2c
and d). from this observation, we hypothesized that th inhibition may inhibit aggregate formation.
in order to clarify this point, inhibitory experiments using
several enzyme inhibitors were performed. simultaneous
amt (10 lm), a competitive inhibitor of th, treatment with
mg132 dramatically decreased aggregate formation in a dose
dependent manner under proteasome inhibition (fig. 2e–g).
on the other hand, benserazide (an inhibitor of aromatic
l-aminoacid decarboxylase), fusaric acid (an inhibitor of  xxxg608xxx ), and kojic acid (an inhibitor of tyrosinase) did not decrease aggregate formation (fig. 3a–g).
further, reserpine, a drug that interferes with the vesicular
storage of cathecholamine, did not inhibit the mg132-induced
aggregate formation. on the contrary, reserpine occasionally
induced huge aggregates in the perinuclear portion (fig. 3h).
furthermore, the addition of l-dopa and/or dopamine under
the inhibition of th by amt canceled the inhibitory eﬀect
of amt (fig. 3f and g). although the percentage of the cells
with aggregates under simultaneous amt (10 lm) treatment
with mg132 was 36.5%, 10 lm l-dopa and dopamine increased the percentage to 58.1% and 64.5%, respectively. norepinephrine demonstrated a similar eﬀect, but less than that of
l-dopa/dopamine (data not shown).
immunoblot analyses using ubiquitin antibodies showed a
reduced high molecular weight smear after amt administra-

tion (fig. 3h). on the other hand, other enzyme inhibitors
such as benserazide did not decrease this ubiquitin smear.
however, amt did not alter a-synuclein polymerization (data
not shown).
3.3. eﬀect of amt on proteasome and  xxxg548xxx  activity
to investigate the eﬀect of amt on the activities of proteasome and  xxxg548xxx , the enzyme activity of each proteolytic
enzyme was measured. although mg132 administration decreased proteasome activity, th inhibition by amt administration increased proteasome activity slightly (fig. 4a and
b).  xxxg548xxx  activity was increased by proteasome inhibition. however, an additional administration of amt downregulated  xxxg548xxx  activity (fig. 4c).
3.4. l-dopa and dopamine induce ubiquitin polymerization in
vitro
in order to investigate the eﬀects of l-dopa and dopamine
on ubiquitin polymerization, a simple experiment using ubiquitin and l-dopa or dopamine without atp or other related
molecules was performed. surprisingly, in this quite simple
condition, l-dopa and dopamine induced ubiquitin polymerization (fig. 5a). further, this polymerized ubiquitin was
detectable by ubiquitin and fk1 antibodies (fig. 5b). these
results suggest that novel mechanisms of ubiquitin polymerization mediated by l-dopa and dopamine may exist, which do
not require energy or other related molecules, such as ubiquitin
ligase.

3.5. cell viability
in order to clarify the role of l-dopa/dopamine-related
aggregate enhancement on cell death under decreased proteasome activity, a viability assay was carried out using the
mtt system. in our experiments, mg132 produced dosedependent cell death at 24 h after administration. however,
amt did not show either a toxic eﬀect or a protective eﬀect
(fig. 6).

4. discussion
several previous reports have implicated dopamine and/or
l-dopa in the cell death observed in pd [6,13,14]. although
the direct mechanisms of selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in pd has not been clariﬁed, some reports suggest

that dopamine/l-dopa-induced oxidative stress [15] and the
co-existence dopamine/l-dopa with a-synuclein may produce
harmful eﬀects in dopaminergic cells [6]. in the same way,

lb formation in dopaminergic and/or cathecholaminergic neurons is one of the most characteristic pathological ﬁndings for
pd. however, the detailed mechanisms of lb formation observed primarily in dopaminergic neurons is not understood.
in this study, we investigated the association between protein
aggregation and dopamine/l-dopa.
we have reported this experimental inclusion model previously [8]. in this model, perinuclear aggregates are formed that
are immunopositive for p62, tubulin, a-synuclein, and ubiquitin. although approximately 80% of the cells show aggregates
at 24 h after mg132 treatment, the size and number of aggregates in the cells may be diﬀerent. since pc12 cells express
abundant th, they will transcribe the 4.2 kb of th promoter-inserted pegfp vector, and express the marker green
ﬂuorescence (fig. 2). interestingly, cells expressing dense green
ﬂuorescence have more and larger aggregates compared to
cells that express slight ﬂuorescence (fig. 2). therefore, we
hypothesized that th activity aﬀects the formation of aggregates under proteasome inhibition. indeed, it has been reported that dopamine induces proteasome inhibition in pc12
cells [12].
in order to clarify this point, we performed inhibitory experiments using amt, a competitive inhibitor of th [16]. amt
has been reported to decrease dopamine levels in pc12 cells
via th inhibition. indeed, amt, but not other enzyme inhibitors such as benserazide, dramatically decreased aggregate
formation. from the converse eﬀect of additional dopamine
and l-dopa on this condition, dopamine and l-dopa may enhance aggregate formation under proteasome inhibition. results from inhibitory experiments (fig. 3h) using reserpine
also support this hypothesis. however, the aggregate formation induced simply by l-dopa or dopamine without mg132
could not be observed (data not shown).
additional excess extracellular dopamine has been reported
to inhibit proteasome activity [12]. consistent with those results, we found that th inhibition slightly increased proteasome activity and decreased  xxxg548xxx  activity (fig. 4).
however, the eﬀect on proteasome activity by amt was slight.
therefore, further mechanisms that enhance aggregate forma-

tion are predicted. in the present study, l-dopa/dopamine easily polymerized ubiquitin non-enzymatically in vitro. although
the detailed mechanism of this phenomenon has not been clariﬁed, it seems to be associated with the observation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates primarily in dopaminergic cells. l-dopa
and dopamine easily change their structure to several metabolites, such as dopaquinone, which may be related to our in vitro observations [17].
it has been reported that dopamine/l-dopa inhibits the conversion of protoﬁbrils to ﬁbrils via the formation of a dopamine-a-synuclein adduct [7]. protoﬁbrils of a-synuclein may
be pathogenic and the ﬁbrils are inert or even protective in
dopaminergic cells. however, in practice, lewy bodies are observed primarily in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. these events are seems to be paradoxical, and other
factors should be considered to fully explain these observations. our observation that dopaminergic cells easily form
the ubiquitin-related aggregates can explain this paradoxical
problem.
in the present study, th inhibition did not alter cell viability. however, recent reports suggest that the formation of
intracellular inclusion bodies results in the sequestration of
proteins that are unnecessary or toxic for cell survival. based
on this hypothesis, aggregate formation in pc12 cells may be
a result of the sequestration of unnecessary proteins including
a-synuclein protoﬁbril to avoid toxic insults.
