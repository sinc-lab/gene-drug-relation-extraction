summary. the prevention by six reversible and selective
 xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx -a (mao-a) inhibitors (c~-ethyltryptamine, harmaline,  xxxd2844xxx , amiflamine
[fla 336(+)], n-desmethylamiflamine [fla 788(+)] and
n,n-desmethylamiflamine [fla 668(+)] of the phenelzineinduced irreversible mao inhibition in the rat brain
was examined. by using crude synaptosome preparations of hypothalamus and striatum incubated with low
substrate concentrations of 14c-serotonin (1 x 10- 7 m), 14cnoradrenaline (2.5x 10 7m) and 14c-dopamine (2.5 •
10 v m) in the absence and presence of selective amine
uptake inhibitors (alaproclate, maprotiline and amfonelic
acid, respectively), it was possible to determine the deaminating activities inside and outside the specific aminergic synaptosomes. thus, with this technique the protection of mao
by the reversible inhibitors administered orally i h prior to the
subcutaneous injection of phenelzine against the phenelzine
effect could be determined inside and outside the specific
aminergic neurons. it was found that c~-ethyltryptamine, 4methoxyamphetamine and particularly amiflamine and fla
788(+) were more potent inside than outside the serotonergic
neurons. fla 668(+) was a selective inhibitor of noradrenergic mao, to which also  xxxd2844xxx , amiflamine
and fla 788(+), but not e-ethyltryptamine had some
preference. harmaline had no certain preference for mao in
any of the aminergic neurons. at high doses of fla 668(+) a
preference for dopaminergic mao was observed. since
pretreatment of the rats with norzimeldine or desipramine
antagonized the preferences for serotonergic or noradrenergic
mao, it is plausible to conclude that the compounds showing
these preferences are accumulated in the neurons by the
membranal uptake systems.

(maycock et al. 1976; singer 1979). thus these inhibitors are
initially substrates for mao. inhibition of the enzyme with
reversible mao inhibitors decreases the formation of these
reactive products and consequently also the inactivation of
the enzyme (pletscher and besendorf 1959; horita and
mcgrath 1960; green and el hait 1980a, b). therefore the
prevention of the long-lasting effect of irreversible mao
inhibitors gives a good measure of the in vivo potencies of
reversible mao inhibitors.
in the present study we have examined the effect of a new
class of reversible and selective mao-a inhibitors, (+)-4amino-2,e-dimethylphenethylamines (florvall et al. 1978;
ask et al. 1982b) on the phenelzine induced inhibition of
mao-a in the rat brain. in these experiments we have
measured the amine deaminating activities in crude synaptosomal preparations from the rat brain, incubated with low
concentrations of the 14c-labelled monoamines 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), (-)-noradrenaline and dopamine in
the absence and presence of selective amine uptake inhibitors.
with this technique it is possible to determine the deaminating activity in the specific aminergic synaptosomes in which
the amines are actively taken up (ross and ask 1980; urwyler
and von wartburg 1981). this method also gives us the
opportunity to examine whether the prevention of the
phenelzine-induced mao inhibition is the same inside these
specific aminergic neurons as in other brain cells. in addition
to the 4-aminophenethylamines, other reversible and selective
mao-a inhibitors, e-ethyltryptamine (florvall et al. 1978),
harmaline (pletscher and besendorf 1959) and  xxxd2844xxx  (green and e1 hair 1980b) were included in the
study.

male sprague-dawley rats weighing 160-200 g were used in
the study. sixteen hours before the oral administration of the
mao inhibitors the rats were deprived of food but were freely
supplied with water. after the phenelzine injection the rats
were again supplied with food. phenelzine sulphate was
injected subcutaneously (4mg/kg in the experiments with
'4c-serotonin and ~4c-noradrenaline deamination, and
2.5mg/kg in the experiment with ~4c-dopamine deamination) i h after the oral administration (lml/kg) of the
reversible mao inhibitors. these doses of phenelzine produced in nonpretreated rats about 70 % inhibition of mao in
the tissues examined 24 h after the injections. control animals
were given distilled water orally and saline or phenelzine
subcutaneously. each group consisted of 5 rats. the rats were
decapitated 24 h after the phenelziue injection.

were purchased from the radiochemical centre, amersham,
england.

hypothalami or striata were rapidty dissected out and
homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-chilled 0.25 m sucrose
solution in small all-glass homogenizers. the homogenates
were centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min, and the synaptosomerich supernatants were analyzed for the  xxxd3355xxx  xxxd2850xxx  deaminating activities.
the incubation mixture, in duplicate, consisted of 50 gl
(14c-serotonin and 14c-dopamine) or 100gl (14c-noradrenaline) of the crude synaptosome preparation, 25gl
of the 14c-labelled amine (1 x 10 7 m final concentration of
~4c-serotonin and 2.5 x 10 -v m final concentrations of ~4cnoradrenaline and ~4c-dopamine) and krebs-henseleit's
buffer, ph 7.4 to a final volume of 1.0ml. the buffer
equilibrated in an atmosphere of 6.5 % co2 in o2 containing
5.4 mm glucose, 2.2 mm  xxxd228xxx , 0.26 mm edtana 2
and with and without the appropriate selective amine uptake
inhibitor. these were for serotonin, 3 x 10 .6 m alaproclate,
for noradrenaline 3 x 10 -6 m maprotiline and for dopamine
3 x 10 -7 m amfonelic acid. in order to hinder a4c-serotonin
being taken up in noradrenergic synaptosomes, maprotiline
(1 x 10 .6 m) was added to the buffer solution. similarly,
in the experiments with  xxxd3355xxx ,noradrenaline, alaproclate
(1 x 10-6 m) was added to the buffer, whereas alaproclate
(1 x 10 -6 m) and maprotiline (1 x 10 .6 m) were present in
the experiments with ~c-dopamine. the incubation was performed in a water bath at 37~ for 10 min and the reaction
was stopped with i ml i m hc1. the ~4c-acid products
formed were extracted into 6 ml of ethyl acetate by vigorous
shaking for 2 • i min in a multi-tube vortexer (model 2601,
scientific manufacturing industries).
after centrifugation aliquots of 4 ml of the organic layer
were transferred to counting vials containing 1 ml of ethanol
and 10ml of econofluor (nen). the radioactivity was
measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. extraction
blauks were made by adding hci before the labelled amines.
standards were prepared by adding 25gl of a solution
containing 2.5 pmol of ~4c-serotonin or 6.25 pmol of 14cnoradrenaline or *4c-dopamine to counting vials containing
1 ml ethanol, 4ml ethyl acetate and 10 ml econofluor.
the recoveries of the ~4c-acid formed, extracted into
ethyl acetate, were determined by repeated extractions of
incubated samples. it was 95 % for a4c-serotonin, 93 % for
~4c-dopamine and 33 ~o for ~4c-noradrenaline. in a separate
experiment 12 identical samples containing the ~4cnoradrenaline deaminated product(s) were extracted. the
standard error of mean for the extraction was 0.7 % of the
control level.

deamination of 14c-serotonin, 14c-noradrenaline
and l~c-dopamine at low concentrations

the time courses of the deamination of 14c-serotonin
(1 x 10 -7 m), 14c-noradrenaline (2.5 x 10 -7 m) and 14cdopamine (2.5 x 10- v m) by the hypothalamic (serotonin and
noradrenaline) and the striatal (dopamine) synaptosome
preparations were linear or sigmoid during the first 20 rain of
incubation (fig. 1). ten minutes incubation was routinely
used in the experiments. the selective uptake inhibitors
decreased the deaminating activities by 40 to 50 % for 14cserotonin and 14c-noradrenaline and by about 80 % for 14cdopamine. after disruption of the synaptosomes by sonication the uptake inhibitors did not decrease the deaminating
activities (table 1). the sonicated preparations had lower
activities than the original preparations. the inhibitory
potencies, expressed as the concentrations of the uptake
inhibitors producing 50 % decrease in the maximal inhibition
of the deamination (ics0), were similar to or even lower than
those for the inhibition of the amine uptake (table 2). the

pattern of selectivity was also similar between the inhibition
of the deamination and the inhibition of uptake.
in experiments with high (5 • 10 -5 m) substrate concentrations the uptake inhibitors had no effect on the
deamination of the amines by the synaptosomal preparations
(data not shown).

prevention of the phenelzine-induced m a o inhibition
~-ethyltryptamine
reversible m a o inhibitors protect against the longlasting
inhibition of m a o produced by irreversible m a o inhibitors
(pletscher and besendorf 1959; horita and m c g r a t h 1960;
green and e1 hait 1980 a, b). a typical experiment of this kind
is shown in table 3, which illustrates one of the five doses ofeethyltryptamine examined. the table gives the rate of the
deamination of a4c-serotonin in the absence and presence of
alaproclate (3 x 1 0 - 6 m ) in the incubation mixture. the
decrease in the deaminating activity represents the deam•
inside the serotonergic synaptosomes, whereas the
deamination in the presence of alaproclate occurred outside
these synaptosomes. phenelzine tended to inhibit the de-

am•
somewhat more outside (74 ~ ) than inside (63 ~o)
the serotonergic neurons (cf. ask et al. 1982a). the prevention by c~-ethyltryptamine of the phenelzine-induced inhibition of mao in the rat hypothalamus when examined
24 h after the phenelzine injection was significantly greater in
the serotonergic synaptosomes than in other m a o - a containing compartments in the preparation. none of the
compounds in the dose ranges tested produced any protection
against phenelzine when administered 24 h before the phenelzine injection, which confirms the reversible action of these
compounds.
the complete dose response curves for ~-ethyltryptamine
in preventing the phenelzine-induced m a o inhibition, measured with 14c-serotonin, 14c-noradrenaline and 14cdopamine as substrates, are shown in fig. 2. the prevention
of the phenelzine effect inside the serotonergic neurons in
hypothalamus was achieved at about 10 times lower doses
than outside these neurons, d-ethyltryptamine, on the other
hand, had no preference for m a o in noradrenergic neurons.
a slightly larger protection of m a o inside the dopamine
neurons than outside these neurons was found in striatum, the
difference being significant at two doses. the doses needed to

harmaline is a selective m a o - a inhibitor in vivo (green
and e1 hait 1980a). after oral administration to rats,
harmaline prevented the phenelzine-induced m a o - a inhibition in hypothalamus and striatum (fig. 3). however, the
c o m p o u n d did not have any certain preference for the mao
in the monoaminergic neurons (table 4). it was orally the
least potent of the compounds examined.

protect m a o in these neurons were slightly lower than those
protecting m a o - a outside the serotonergic neurons but
higher than those protecting serotonergic m a o (table 4).
pretreatment of the rats with norzimeldine 10 mg/kg s.c.
3 0 m i n prior to the administration of e-ethyltryptamine
decreased the effect of e-ethyltryptamine in the serotonergic
neurons (table 5).

 xxxd2844xxx  is a reversible mao-a inhibitor
in vivo (green and e1 hait 1980b). this compound preferably protected m a o - a in noradrenergic and serotonergic
neurons but not in dopaminergic neurons (fig. 4).
pretreatment of the rats with desipramine (5 mg/kg s.c.) or
norzimeldine (10mg/kg s.c.) reduced the preference for
noradrenergic and serotonergic mao, respectively (tables 5
and 6). interestingly, the potency increased non-selectively in
the desipramine-treated rats.

amiflamine [fla 336(+)] is a new potent reversible
m a o - a inhibitor (florvall et al. 1978; ask et al. 1982b). this
c o m p o u n d was very potent in protecting serotonergic m a o
from phenelzine-induced inactivation in the rat hypothalamus (fig. 5). thus it was 7 times more potent inside than
outside these neurons (table 4). pretreatment of the rats with
norzimeldine (10 mg/kg s.c.) reduced the potency of amiflamine inside the serotonergic neurons without changing the
potency outside the neurons (table 5). these observations
confirm previously reported preliminary results (ask et al.
1982a).
amiflamine also had some preference for protection of
noradrenergic m a o (fig. 5) but less compared with that of
the serotonergic m a o (table4). m a o in dopaminergic
neurons in striatum did not appear to be preferably protected by amiflamine (fig. 5).

similar to those for amiflamine (fig. 6 and table4).
pretreatment of the rats with norzimeldine (10 mg/kg s.c.) or
desipramine (5mg/kg s.c.) reduced the preference of f l a
788(+) in protecting serotonergic and noradrenergic m a o ,
respectively (tables 5 and 6).
fla 668(+) is the n,n-didesmethylated derivative of
amiflamine and is formed from the latter c o m p o u n d in the rat,
dog and man (unpublished observations). it is less potent
than amiflamine and f l a 788(+) in inhibiting mitochondrial
m a o - a in vitro (ask et al. to be published). in the dose range
examined, f l a 668(+) caused very slight protection against
the effect of phenelzine on the deamination of 1~c-5-ht both
inside and outside serotonergic neurons in the hypothalamus
(fig. 7). however, in noradrenergic neurons it caused a very
p r o n o u n c e d protection of m a o with little effect outside these
neurons in the do~e range examined. f l a 668(+) also had
some preference for dopaminergic m a o but at considerably
higher doses than those protecting noradrenergic m a o
(table 4). pretreatment of the rats with desipramine (5 mg/kg
s.c.) or anafonelic acid (2mg/kg s.c.) antagonized the m a o protecting effect of f l a 668(+) in the noradrenergic neurons
(table 6) and the dopaminergic neurons (data not shown),
respectively.

discussion

the deamination of the examined 14c_amines by m a o in the
crude synaptosomal preparations was inhibited by amine
uptake inhibitors at low (1 to 2.5 x 10 7 m) but not at high (5
• 10 - s m) substrate concentrations. disruption of the synaptosomes by means of sonication abolished the inhibitory
effects of the uptake inhibitors. these observations indicate
that at low concentrations a considerable part of the deamination occurred in the specific aminergic synaptosomes
after accumulation of the substrates via the membranal
uptake mechanisms. the decrease in the deaminating activity
after sonication may be explained by a reduced substrate
concentration, since m a o is no longer located intrasynaptosomally. however, inactivation of the enzyme by the sonication procedure m a y also explain this decrease.
the selectivities of the uptake inhibitors in inhibiting the
deamination were similar to those of the uptake inhibition.
thus the deamination occurred mainly in the specific neuron
systems. however, in order to further ascertain the neuron
specificity in the experiments, it is possible to add selective
uptake inhibitors to the incubation media, i.e. maprotiline to
inhibit uptake into noradrenergic synaptosomes and alaproc-

late to inhibit the uptake into serotonergic synaptosomes.
because of the lack of a selective dopamine uptake inhibitor
the possible uptake and deamination into dopaminergic
synaptosomes is difficult to hinder without inhibition of the
uptake in other aminergic synaptosomes. however, amfonelic acid in addition to maprotiline or alaproclate in the
incubation medium did not further decrease the deamination
of 14c-noradrenaline or 14c-serotonin (unpublished observation) which indicates that deamination of these substrates
in dopaminergic synaptosomes of the hypothalamus preparation could be neglected.
by combining the described method for determining the
amine deaminating activities in synaptosomes derived from
specific neuron systems with the technique of pretreating rats
with reversible mao-a inhibitors to protect the long-lasting
mao inhibition by phenelzine, an irreversible mao inhibitor, we have been able to analyze the in vivo potencies of
these inhibitors in specific monoaminergic neurons in the rat
brain. these experiments have given the interesting results
that some reversible mao-a inhibitors are more potent
inside one or several of the monoaminergic neurons than
outside these neurones. thus, c~-ethyltryptamine was more
than 6 times more potent inside than outside serotonergic
neurons in the rat hypothalamus, whereas no preference for
noradrenergic or dopaminergic neurons was observed, c~ethyltryptamine is accordingly a selective inhibitor of  xxxg1357xxx  in serotonergic neurons in the rat brain. similarly, amiflamine and fla 788(+) were found to be selective serotonergic mao-a inhibitors, in this respect 5 times more potent
than e-ethyltryptamine.
they also have some prelerence tor noradrenergic  xxxg1357xxx . fla 668(+), on the other hand is, a selective inhibitor of
mao-a in noradrenergic neurons but with lower potency
compared with amiflamine and fla 788(+). finally, hatmaline has no certain preference for mao in any of the
monoaminergic neurons. the slightly greater protection in
the neurons observed for harmaline may be due to a
difference in the distribution of phenelzine which has a
tendency to inhibit the extraneuronal mao-a slightly more
than the neuronal mao-a. the rather uniform protection by
harmaline of the phenelzine-induced mao inhibition
strongly supports is the idea that the neuron-directed selectivities of the other reversible mao inhibitors are real
and not artifacts.
the antagonism of the protection against the phenelzine
induced mao inhibition by pretreatment of the rats with the
uptake inhibitors gives a plausible explanation to the neuronal selective action of the reversible mao inhibitors. by
accumulation via the aminergic membrane transport systems
the intraneuronal concentrations of the inhibitors become
much higher than the extraneuronal concentrations. thus,
amiflamine and/or fla 788(+) are transported into serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons probably with preference for
the former. fla 668(+), on the other hand, appears to be
taken up only in noradrenergic neurons. the high mao
inhibition in the serotonergic neurons probably explains the
increase in the serotonin concentration in the rat brain
observed at low doses of amiflamine (ogren et al. 1981).
although new for brain areas, this principle of selective
inhibition of neuronal mao has previously been demonstrated in peripheral neurons, furchgott et al. (1971)
reported that the quarternary ammonium compound  xxxd364xxx , which is a relatively weak mao inhibitor, is accumulated in peripheral noradrenergic neurones by the noradren-

aline pump, which gives sufficiently high concentrations to
inhibit mao in the neurons. similarly, amezinium is accumulated in noradrenergic nerve terminals in the rat heart by the
noradrenaline uptake mechanism and produces inhibition of
mao in these terminals (steppeler and starke 1980).
although  xxxd2844xxx  and harmaline potently protect brain mao against phenelzine-induced inhibition if given intraperitoneally to mice and rats (green and
e1 hait 1980a, b and own observations), these compounds
had rather weak protecting potencies if given orally. these
findings indicate a rapid metabolism of the compounds after
oral administration. the observation that desipramine increased the protecting potency of  xxxd2844xxx 
both inside and outside noradrenergic neurons (table 6) can
thus be explained by desipramine inhibiting the metabolism
of  xxxd2844xxx .
the neuron-directed selectivities of reversible mao-a
inhibitors are therapeutically interesting. the present study
shows that it is possible to develop reversible mao-a
inhibitors with selective action in serotonergic or noradrenergic neurons. the neuronal selectivity may reduce or even
abolish those side effects which are common for non-selective
mao inhibitors, e.g. tyramine potentiation. the antidepressive action of e-ethyltryptamine quoted by zircle and
kaiser (1964) suggests that the inhibition of serotonergic
mao by e.g. amiflamine and fla 788(+) is of particular
interest for this disease. however, the selective inhibition of
mao in noradrenergic neurons, by for instance fla 668(+),
may also have therapeutic applications.
the results obtained in this study showing that c~ethyltryptamine,  xxxd2844xxx , amiflamine and
fla 788(-f) are transported by the membranal serotonin
transport mechanism are important, since they give further
information on the structure activity relationships for compounds transported by this carrier. in a previous study (ross
and ask 1980) using a similar approach as that in the present
study, we did not find any evidence that c~-ethyltryptamine
was transported by the serotonin uptake carrier. the reason
for this failure to detect any preference of e-ethyltryptamine
for serotonergic mao may be explained by the high dose of c~ethyltryptamine examined, 80 pmol/kg. at this dose both the
neuronal and extraneuronal mao are largely protected
against phenelzine.
in conclusion, this study shows that reversible mao-a
inhibitors can selectively inhibit the enzyme in specific
monoaminergic neurons probably by being accumulated via
the membranal uptake mechanisms.
