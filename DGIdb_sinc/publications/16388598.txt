abstract: p2x receptors play an important role in communication between cells in the nervous system.
therefore, understanding the mechanisms of inhibition of these receptors is important for the development
of new tools for drug discovery. our objective has been to determine the pharmacological activity of the
antagonist  xxxd3266xxx , the most important antagonist of purinergic receptor function, as well as to demonstrate
its noncompetitive inhibition and confirm a competitive mechanism between atp and tnp-atp in 1321n1
glial cells stably transfected with the recombinant rat p2x2 receptor. a radioligand binding assay was
employed to determine whether  xxxd3266xxx , tnp-atp, and atp compete for the same binding site on the
receptor. tnp-atp displaced [r-32p]atp, whereas  xxxd3266xxx  did not interfere with [r-32p]atp-receptor
binding. to determine the inhibition mechanism relevant for channel opening, currents obtained in fast
kinetic whole-cell recording experiments, following stimulation of cells by atp in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx ,
were compared to those obtained by atp in the presence of tnp-atp. supported by a mathematical
model for receptor kinetics [breitinger, h. g., geetha, n., and hess, g. p. (2001) biochemistry 40, 84198429], the inhibition factors were plotted as functions of inhibitor or agonist concentrations. analysis of
the data indicated a competitive inhibition mechanism for tnp-atp and a noncompetitive inhibition for
 xxxd3266xxx . taken together, both data support a noncompetitive inhibition mechanism of the rat recombinant
p2x2 receptor by  xxxd3266xxx , confirm the competitive inhibition by tnp-atp, and allow the prediction of
a model for p2x2 receptor inhibition.

the biological effects of extracellular purine nucleotides
acting through p2 receptors have been studied in many cell
and tissue types. atp is now recognized as an important
messenger molecule in cell-cell communication in the
central nervous system and has been shown to be involved
in brain development (1-3). the p2x receptors are formed
from seven distinct gene products encoding different atpgated ion channel subunits (4). the p2x receptor has a
distinctive structural motif, with each subunit containing two
hydrophobic transmembrane domains connected by a large
intervening hydrophilic extracellular loop (5). the protein
subunits combine as either homomultimers or heteromultimers to form functional membrane-spanning multimeric
receptors (6-9). the inclusion of multiple subunits into a

functional receptor can confer distinct biophysical and
pharmacological properties to a particular receptor subtype
(10, 11).
according to ding and sachs (12), the best model with
which to describe the channel opening of p2x receptors can
be summarized as follows. (i) the channel proceeds through
three atp binding steps before opening. (ii) the three atp
binding sites are positively cooperative. (iii) there are two
open states, which connect to a common atp-independent
closed state. (iv) activation and deactivation proceed along
the same pathway. (v) channels open only after having
bound to three ligand molecules.
the pharmacological investigation of p2x receptors has
been hampered by the lack of potent subtype-selective
ligands and antagonists. antagonists, such as  xxxd3266xxx , 2′,3′o-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (tnpatp),1 and their analogues have traditionally been used as
p2x receptor antagonists (13-16). moreover, these compounds are relatively nonselective and exhibit nanomolar to
micromolar binding affinities for p2x receptors (16-18),
and the mechanism of inhibition of the receptor by these
compounds is not yet well understood.
dunn and blakeley (19) were the first to demonstrate that
 xxxd3266xxx  antagonizes purinergic receptor activity. in many

inhibition mechanism of the p2x2 receptor
studies,  xxxd3266xxx  has been reported to be one of the mainly
important, nonselective, and reversible inhibitors of these
receptors (20-23). in most cases,  xxxd3266xxx  has been described
as a competitive inhibitor displacing atp from the ligandbinding site of the receptor (24-27). this conclusion is based
on the effect of these compounds on dose-effect curves
induced by the purinergic receptor agonist r,beta-methyleneatp in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  (24), competition of  xxxd3266xxx 
with r,beta-methylene-atp for receptor binding as determined
by autoradiographic studies of rat brain sections (25), and
electrophysiological studies with recombinant receptors
expressed in oocytes and cells (26, 27). however, results
obtained by wong and collaborators (28) from single-channel
measurements using rat hippocampus patches indicated that
the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3266xxx  on p2x receptor activity was
inconsistent with a simple competitive antagonism model.
the atp analogue tnp-atp has been used for labeling
atp-binding sites in a variety of tissues (29, 30). mockett
et al. (31) and king et al. (32) were among the first to
describe antagonist effects of tnp-atp on p2x receptors.
this potent and relatively selective p2x receptor antagonist
has recently been used to characterize a variety of native
p2x receptors (33-36).
tnp-atp is a close structural analogue of atp, suggesting that it may bind to the extracellular atp binding pocket
of p2x receptors, and may act as a competitive antagonist.
this appeared to be the case when nondesensitizing atp
responses on cochlear hair cells were blocked by tnp-atp
in a competitive manner (31). experiments published by
burgard and colleagues (37) also indicated a competitive
inhibition mechanism. however, virginio et al. (38) described tnp-atp as a noncompetitive antagonist of rapidly
desensitizing recombinant rat p2x3 receptors.
in an attempt to elucidate the inhibition mechanism of
 xxxd3266xxx  and tnp-atp and to provide a strong basis for
further pharmacological analysis of p2x receptors, we have
examined the mechanism of inhibition of a recombinant p2x2
receptor by  xxxd3266xxx  and by tnp-atp. our results suggest
that  xxxd3266xxx  behaves as a noncompetitive antagonist, binding
to a different site on the receptor compared to atp, and
confirm the competitive action of tnp-atp.
materials and methods
material. unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were
purchased from sigma and were of the highest available
quality. [r-32p]atp (3.000 ci/mmol) was from amersham.
cell culture and maintenance. human 1321n1 astrocytoma cells expressing recombinant rat p2x2 receptors, as
already described for the recombinant  xxxg1646xxx  receptors (39,
40), were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem, high glucose, invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (cultilab, campinas, brazil) in the
presence of 100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin,
and 0.5 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  (sigma) at 37 °c in a watersaturated atmosphere containing 5% co2. cell cultures were
subcultured weekly, seeded at 5 × 105 cells/culture flask
(175 cm2), and fed three times during that period by replacing
the old medium. for electrophysiology, 2 × 104 cells were
plated into 35 mm cell culture dishes and used for experiments within 2-4 days.
whole-cell recording. recording glass pipets were pulled
from borosilicate glass (world precision instruments inc.,

biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 1, 2006 225
berlin, germany), using a two-stage puller (sutter p-10,
sutter instruments, novato, ca). pipet tips were fire-polished
using a flame polisher (mf-83, narishige, tokyo, japan).
the extracellular recording buffer contained 145 mm nacl,
5.3 mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2‚2h2o, 1.2 mm mgcl2, 10 mm
glucose, and 10 mm hepes; the ph was adjusted to 7.4
with naoh. the intracellular solution contained 140 mm
kcl, 10 mm nacl, 2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm egta, and 10
mm hepes; the ph was adjusted to 7.4 with koh. an
axopatch 200a amplifier and the pclamp software packet
(molecular devices corp., union city, ca) were used for
data collection. the obtained data were analyzed on a
personal computer using microcal origin (northampton,
ma). all measurements were carried out at ph 7.4 and 2123 °c at a transmembrane voltage of -60 mv. data from
each cell were normalized to the response measured with
100 µm atp. all solutions used in the experiments were
prepared on the day of the measurement.
the flow method used for rapid ligand application has been
described by krishtal and pidoplichko (41) and udgaonkar
and hess (42). briefly, a cell in the whole-cell recording
configuration (43) was placed ca. 100 µm from the porthole
(diameter of ca. 100 µm) of a u-tube (hamilton, reno, nv)
(41). the flow rate of solutions emerging from the flow
device, containing neurotransmitter with or without inhibitor,
was typically 1 cm/s. measurements were taken in intervals
of 5 min, a time sufficient to allow for recovery of
desensitized receptors (44).
western blotting. 1321n1 glial cells were resuspended in
pbs (phosphate-buffered saline) with 2 mm edta. cell
lyses was started by sonication (3 × 10 pulses at 30%) in
the presence of protease inhibitors. the material was
centrifuged for 15 min at 3000g and 4 °c, and the supernatant
was collected. the supernatant was ultracentrifuged for 1.5
h at 100000g and 4 °c, and the pellet was resuspended in
50 mm hepes (ph 7.4).
forty micrograms of membrane proteins from ultracentrifugation was mixed with sds-page sample buffer
containing 0.05% (v/v)  xxxd26xxx , heated for 5 min
to 95 °c, separated on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels, and
electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (transblot, 0.45
µm, bio-rad). the membranes were incubated with a
blocking solution containing 3% nonfat milk powder in
pbs-t (pbs with 0.05% tween 20) for 30 min at room
temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °c with
a 1/250 dilution of goat polyclonal anti-p2x2 antibody (santa
cruz biotechnology, heidelberg, germany) in the same
blocking solution. following three washes with pbs-t,
membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-goat igg (1/100) (santa
cruz biotechnology). reactions were developed by using
the ecl plus kit (pierce) according to the instructions
provided by the manufacturer.
radioligand binding assay. radioligand binding methodology was generally adapted from procedures described
by michel et al. (45) and modified to enhance specific
binding to living cells expressing rat p2x2 receptors. 1321n1
human glioma cells (200 000) expressing the recombinant
p2x2 receptor were incubated for 30 min at 25 °c in pbs at
ph 7.4 with [r-32p]atp (200 000 cpm, 130 pm) in the
absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the
antagonists  xxxd3266xxx  and tnp-atp to determine whether

 xxxd3266xxx , tnp-atp, and [r-32p]atp compete for the same
binding site. the percentage of nonspecific binding of [r-32p]atp was determined in the presence of 100 µm unlabeled
atp.
following incubation, the cells were washed three times
with pbs, solubilized in the presence of sds (1%), and
transferred to scintillation vials. receptor-bound [r-32p]atp
was quantified by scintillation counting. protein concentrations were determined as described by bradford (46).
data analysis. the relation between a, the measured
whole-cell current amplitude, and the concentration of open
receptor channels was derived for the acetylcholine receptor
(47, 48), and the equation was then adapted to apply to cellflow measurements (42). when the initial ligand concentration is much larger than the number of moles of receptor in
the absence of desensitization, this relation is given by (49)

results
in this work, we have compared the inhibition mechanisms
of the rat recombinant p2x2 receptor by two purinergic
receptor antagonists, tnp-atp and  xxxd3266xxx . as shown in
figure 1, tnp-atp is an atp analogue with a trinitrophenyl
group added to the ribose moiety. the structural similarity
of tnp-atp and atp suggests that both molecules may
interact with the same binding site on p2x receptors. in the
case of  xxxd3266xxx , the same suggestion is not plausible.
we have used 1321n1 human glioma cells stably transfected with p2x2 receptors as a model for studying p2x2
receptor inhibition, since these cells do not express any
endogenous functional purinergic receptors (39, 40). we have
verified the presence of p2x2 receptors on the mrna
transcription and protein expression level. p2x2 receptor gene
expression was detected by rt-pcr. the amplified cdna

was carried out as described in materials and methods. the reaction
was developed using the ecl chemiluminescence reaction (pierce)
followed by exposure to kodak x-omat film.

figure 3: cell-flow investigations of the effects of atp,  xxxd3266xxx ,
and tnp-atp on rat p2x2 receptors of 1321n1 glial cells. all
measurements were carried out at ph 7.4 and 25 °c, with a fixed
membrane voltage of -60 mv, using a rapid chemical kinetic
technique and a flow rate of the atp solution of 1 cm/s for the
rapid equilibration of the cell surface receptor with the ligand (41,
42). (a) whole-cell current response of the receptors to 100 µm
atp. the observed whole-cell current (solid line) is a measure of
the number of receptors in the open-channel form in the cell
membrane and reached a maximum value in ∼80 ms. the falling
phase of the current, indicative of receptor desensitization, exhibits
only one process. the rate coefficient for receptor desensitization
(r) was 0.45 ( 0.1 s-1. (b) inhibition of the whole-cell current

determined by dna sequencing of the pcr product (genbank accession number nm_053656) (data not shown).
western blot analysis revealed the presence of only one
isoforms with a molecular mass of 70 kda and no splice
variants of the p2x2 receptor (figure 2).
figure 3 shows a representative whole-cell current measurement performed in the presence of 100 µm atp (a,

line), using the cell-flow technique (41, 42). the current
obtained with 100 µm atp reached a maximum value within

80 ms, showing rapid receptor activation. in all experiments
with more than 30 different cells at atp concentrations
ranging from 1 to 1000 µm, only one of these cells exhibited
a significant desensitization rate. the slope was equal to
-0.116 ( 0.006, and the rate coefficient for receptor
desensitization (r) was 0.45 ( 0.1 s-1, reflecting slow
desensitization of receptors in the presence of the agonist.
co-application of tnp-atp resulted in a reduction of the
whole-cell current obtained in the presence of atp, but did
not interfere with the receptor desensitization as the rate
coefficient for desensitization did not change (r ) 0.40 (
0.06 s-1).  xxxd3266xxx  application affected the amplitude of the
whole-cell current, as well as the desensitization rate. the
slope of current decay in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  was -0.036
( 0.002, and the rate coefficient that was obtained was 0.70
( 0.17 s-1.
currents induced by atp concentrations between 1 and
1000 µm ranged from 10 to 4971 pa (figure 4a). the values
of the constants accounting for the observed current due to
channel opening were evaluated using a nonlinear fit of these
data to eq 1. ec50 for receptor activation by atp was
determined to be 42 ( 2 µm (r2 ) 0.98), and the hill slope
was 2.11 ( 0.04 (solid line; r2 ) 0.98), suggesting the
presence of three atp binding sites for channel opening (12).
a simulation with a hill slope of <2 was created to
investigate the possibility of binding of two atp prior to
channel opening (dotted line). in this situation, we observed
a correlation index equal to 0.82 and a statistically different
data fit (p ) 0,0438), supporting the necessity of three atp
molecules for channel opening. the dissociation constant for
binding of atp to the receptor (k1) was calculated as 38 (
2 µm according to eq 2. the channel opening equilibrium
constant (phi-1) as a measure of receptor activation in the
presence of the agonist was 0.110 ( 0.012, following
linearization of the dose-dependence curve of atp (eq 2).
an atp concentration of 100 µm which represents a
condition where receptors are mainly in the open-channel
form was used to determine inhibition constants for  xxxd3266xxx 
and tnp-atp. the data were replotted using linear regression for comparison of results obtained in the presence of
tnp-atp or  xxxd3266xxx .
inhibition of the p2x2 receptor by tnp-atp. as expected,
tnp-atp by itself did not activate p2x2 receptors in 1321n1
glioma cells (data not shown). however, tnp-atp inhibited
atp-mediated whole-cell currents when co-applied with the
neurotransmitter. the ic50 value of p2x2 receptor inhibition
by tnp-atp was 9.4 ( 0.9 µm (r2 ) 0.97) with a hill
slope of -0.76 ( 0.70 (figure 4b).
to determine whether tnp-atp inhibits the p2x2 receptor
by competing with atp for the ligand-binding site or by an
independent noncompetitive mechanism, whole-cell currents
obtained in the presence of 100 µm atp and increasing
concentrations of tnp-atp (from 10 to 300 µm) were
plotted as a function of antagonist concentration (figure 5a).
the channel opening equilibrium constant in the presence
of tnp-atp (phi-1) decreased from 0.110 ( 0.012 to 0.002
( 0.001, indicating that the equilibrium between channel
opening and closing was shifted to the closed channel form.
when a single, identical binding site for both atp and tnpatp was proposed, according to the method of cheng and
prusoff (50), the dissociation constant for receptor inhibition
by tnp-atp (ki) was calculated to be 3 ( 1 µm.

all measurements were carried out at ph 7.4 and 25 °c, with a fixed membrane voltage of -60 mv. (a) dependence of current amplitudes
on the concentration of atp (9) obtained in cell-flow experiments. each data point represents the mean value of 3-19 data points obtained
from 49 cells. the currents of each cell with increasing concentrations of atp were normalized to those obtained in the presence of 100
µm atp. the current obtained in different cells in the presence of atp ranged from 10 to 4971 pa. the hill slope was 2.11 ( 0.04 (solid
line). the ec50 value was determined to be 42 ( 2 µm (r2 ) 0.98). the dotted line is a simulation of two binding sites for channel opening
(hill slope was set to 1.8; r2 ) 0.82). the inset shows a linear curve fit of the same plot (eq 2). the linear fit of the data gave an intercept
of 0.480 ( 0.002, resulting in the value for the channel opening equilibrium constant (phi-1) of 0.110 ( 0.012 and the dissociation constant
for atp-receptor binding (k1) of 38 ( 2 µm. (b) dependence of the current amplitudes obtained by 100 µm atp on the concentration
of tnp-atp (b). each data point represents the mean value of 5-14 data points obtained from 58 cells. currents were normalized to those
obtained with 100 µm atp. currents ranged from 0 to 3800 pa. the hill slope was -0.76 ( 0.70. the ic50 value was 9.4 ( 0.9 µm (r2

corresponding to each concentration of atp are mean values from 3-10 measurements from a total of 35 cells. currents were normalized
to those obtained with 100 µm atp alone. currents ranged from 764 to 2680 pa. the hill slope was-0.82 ( 0.04. the ic50 for inhibition
by  xxxd3266xxx  was 34 ( 2 µm (r2 ) 0.98).

 xxxd3266xxx  concentrations. (a) inhibition of p2x2 receptors by tnp-atp (b) at a constant atp concentration of 100 µm. curve fitting was
carried out according to eq 4 by simulation of linear (solid line, in the case of a competitive inhibitor) and nonlinear (dotted line, for a
noncompetitive inhibitor) fits. the linear fit applied best for the data (r2 ) 0.97 and a slope of 0.0165 ( 0.0003 µm-1) indicating a
competitive mechanism. the channel opening equilibrium constant (phi-1) was equal to 0.002 ( 0.001, as calculated from the intercept. the
constant for receptor inhibition by tnp-atp (ki) was calculated to be 3 ( 1 µm (50). (b) inhibition of the p2x2 receptors by  xxxd3266xxx  (2)

to be nonlinear and to show a cube root dependence on inhibitor concentration, according to eq 5. the nonlinear fit (solid line) shows a
correlation index of 0.97, indicating a nonlinear inhibition mechanism for the p2x2 receptor by  xxxd3266xxx . the dotted line provides a simulation
of linear curve fitting.

the dose-response curve for atp acting upon p2x
receptors is shifted to higher concentrations of agonist in
the presence of a competitive antagonist, and subsequently,
ec50 values for atp-induced receptor activation increase
without a change in the maximum current (amax). however,
a noncompetitive inhibitor that binds preferentially to the
closed-channel form can also account for these observations
(51). therefore, it is necessary to differentiate between a
competitive inhibitor and a noncompetitive inhibitor that
binds mainly to the closed-channel form and prevents
receptor activation. equation 4 predicts that the plot of (amax/
ai - 1)1/3 versus the concentration of a competitive inhibitor
will be linear, whereas the curve fit for a noncompetitive
inhibitor will be nonlinear. in the case of noncompetitive

inhibition, (amax/ai - 1)1/3 is proportional to the cube root
of inhibitor concentration multiplied by a constant (eq 5).
the comparison of a nonlinear and a linear regression for
curve fitting of tnp-atp inhibition of the p2x2 receptor
activity, as shown in figure 5a, indicates that a linear
relationship fits the data better, consequently confirming a
competitive inhibition mechanism. the data fitted by linear
regression have a slope equal to 0.0165 ( 0.0004 µm-1 (r2
) 0.99). in contrast, a plot for a noncompetitive inhibitor is
expected to be a nonlinear curve fit, and this curve is
simulated (dotted line) in figure 5a.
the ratio of the current amplitudes obtained in cell-flow
experiments in the absence, a, and presence, ai(x), of inhibitor
(eq 7) can provide additional information about the inhibition

figure 6: inhibition of the p2x2 receptors by tnp-atp and
 xxxd3266xxx . experimental conditions were as described in the legends
of figures 3 and 4. inhibition of p2x2 receptors by various
concentrations of tnp-atp (b) or  xxxd3266xxx  (2) was studied at a
constant atp concentration of 100 µm. three to six measurements
were performed for each tnp-atp or  xxxd3266xxx  concentration. a
total of 38 cells were used for these measurements. the data were
plotted according to eq 6 or 7 using an amax of 3824 pa. (b)

is still valid at higher inhibitor concentrations.

mechanism. a linear relationship exists between a/ai(x) and
the noncompetitive inhibitor concentration over a wide
concentration range. in the case of a competitive inhibitor,
however, the plot of the ratio of a/ai(x) versus competitive
inhibitor concentration is expected to be linear only at low
inhibitor concentrations, when fa(x/kx) is small compared
to 3fa + fal (see eq 7). fa and fal represent the fractions
of receptors in form a and al (in this case, a represents
the active, non-desensitized receptor and l the neurotransmitter), respectively. figure 6 shows plots of a/ai(x) versus
increasing tnp-atp concentrations (b) at a constant atp
concentration of 100 µm according to eq 7. as expected for
competitive inhibitors, a linear relationship between a/ai(x)
and tnp-atp concentration was obtained only at low
inhibitor concentrations in the range of 0-30 µm tnp-atp.
the inhibition constant obtained at a low concentration of
tnp-atp calculated by using eq 7 was found to be 3.7 (
0.2 µm.
a radioligand binding assay was employed to corroborate
and determine whether tnp-atp (from 0.01 to 100 µm)
and [r-32p]atp (200 000 cpm, 130 pm) compete for the
same binding sites on the receptor. as demonstrated in figure
8, tnp-atp displaced [r-32p]atp from the atp-binding
site, and potently inhibited the specific binding of [r-32p]atp to p2x2 receptors with an ic50 equal to 2.7 ( 0.1 µm.
this value is in agreement with that obtained from wholecell current recording (figures 5 and 6), confirming the
competitive inhibition mechanism of p2x2 receptors by tnpatp in living 1321n1 cells.

and 25 °c, with a fixed membrane voltage of -60 mv. the
dependence of the obtained current amplitude on the concentration
of atp (9), as already demonstrated in figure 4a, was determined
by cell-flow experiments. the current obtained in the presence of
100 µm  xxxd3266xxx  (0) with three to nine measurements was
determined at each concentration of atp for a total of nine points
from 22 cells. the obtained current ranged from 700 to 2348 pa.
the hill slope was 2.2 ( 0.3, and the ec50 was equal to 44.5 (

(figure 4c). preincubation of cells with 100 µm  xxxd3266xxx 
for 10 min, a sufficient time for saturation of p2x2 receptors
with the inhibitor (54), increased the inhibition factor
compared to that for the co-application of the same  xxxd3266xxx 
concentration with atp (data not shown). inhibition of p2x2
receptor activity in different tissues by  xxxd3266xxx  has previously been observed. whether this inhibition is competitive
or noncompetitive with atp binding to the ligand site of
the receptor is not yet well understood.
the results shown in figure 5b indicate that  xxxd3266xxx  is a
noncompetitive inhibitor of stably transfected 1321n1 glial
cells expressing recombinant rat p2x2 receptors in the
concentration range from 10 to 300 µm. in the case of
noncompetitive inhibition, the plot of (amax/ai - 1)1/3 versus
increasing antagonist concentration fits best to a nonlinear
model, as (amax/ai - 1)1/3 is proportional to the cube root of
the inhibitor concentration (eq 5). figure 5b shows that curve
fitting of this plot is not linear (r2 ) 0.97), suggesting a
noncompetitive inhibition mechanism in which  xxxd3266xxx  binds
preferentially to the closed-channel form. in figure 5b, the
dotted line is a simulation of curve fitting by linear
regression.
the following evidence further supports a noncompetitive
inhibition mechanism for  xxxd3266xxx . in contrast to the a/ai(x)
inhibition ratio versus antagonist concentration plots with
the inhibitor tnp-atp, which is linear only at low concentrations, the analysis of the a/ai(x) inhibition ratio versus
 xxxd3266xxx  concentration shows a linearity over the whole
concentration range of  xxxd3266xxx  (from 1 to 300 µm) used in
the experiment (figure 6), indicating again a noncompetitive
inhibition mechanism for  xxxd3266xxx  as predicted by eq 6. this
equation allows the determination of the apparent dissociation
constant (kx) of the noncompetitive inhibitor binding to the
receptor prior to desensitization (kx ) 38 ( 1 µm). the
apparent channel opening equilibrium constant in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  phi-1′ is decreased (0.003 ( 0.002) compared
to phi-1 in the presence of atp alone. thus, in accordance

figure 8: displacement of [32p]atp from recombinant rat p2x2
receptors expressed in 1321n1 cells using  xxxd3266xxx  (2) and tnpatp (b) as competitors. the dotted line (*) represents the
nonspecific binding of [r-32p]atp to 1321n1 cells expressing rat
p2x2 receptors in the presence of 100 µm unlabeled atp.
experimental conditions are detailed in materials and methods. all
measurements were carried out in triplicate. note the displacement
of [r-32p]atp in the presence of tnp-atp with ic50 equal to 2.7
( 0.1 µm and no interference of  xxxd3266xxx  with [r-32p]atp receptor
binding.

with other published studies (16, 55, 56),  xxxd3266xxx  is a less
effective inhibitor than tnp-atp.
to provide further proof for the model of noncompetitive
inhibition of the p2x2 receptor by  xxxd3266xxx , a classical
experiment was performed by measuring atp activation
curves of receptor activity in the absence of  xxxd3266xxx  (9)
and at a fixed  xxxd3266xxx  concentration (0, 100 µm) (figure
7). the agonist-induced whole-cell current was inhibited by
a factor of approximately 2 at various atp concentrations.
concentration-response analysis revealed that 100 µm
 xxxd3266xxx  attenuated the response to atp, but did not alter
the ec50 for atp-receptor activation. in presence of  xxxd3266xxx ,
the obtained ec50 for atp activation was 44.5 ( 1.4 µm
(hill slope of 2.2 ( 0.3), compared to 42 ( 2 µm (hill
slope of 2.11 ( 0.04) in the presence of atp alone. these
data indicate and support a noncompetitive effect of  xxxd3266xxx 
on the atp action site.
displacement of [r-32p]atp from recombinant rat p2x2
receptors expressed in 1321n1 cells using  xxxd3266xxx  (2) as a
competitor in radioligand binding assays provided further
evidence that atp and  xxxd3266xxx  do not compete for the same
binding site (figure 8). co-incubation of various concentrations of  xxxd3266xxx  (from 0.01 to 100 µm) and [r-32p]atp did
not interfere with [r-32p]atp receptor binding. this result
is in agreement with that obtained from whole-cell recording
measurements shown in figures 5-7, confirming the noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition of p2x2 by  xxxd3266xxx  in
living 1321n1 cells.
according to our results (figures 5-8), the previously
published explanation for an inhibition mechanism of the
p2x2 receptor by  xxxd3266xxx  (24) is not plausible. our data
support a competitive inhibition mechanism for tnp-atp
and a noncompetitive inhibition mechanism for  xxxd3266xxx .
discussion
a rapid chemical kinetic technique with a 10 ms time
resolution was used to investigate the mechanism of atp
activation and  xxxd3266xxx  and tnp-atp inhibition of the rat
p2x2 receptor expressed in stably transfected 1321n1 glioma
cells. the technique consists of rapidly exchanging ligand

trujillo et al.
solutions on the cell surface (42) in combination with the
whole-cell current recording technique (43) to measure the
current due to channel openings of purinergic receptors that
occurs while the cell surface equilibrates with atp in the
absence or presence of inhibitors.
rat p2x2 receptors exhibit a slow desensitization process,
as determined by the rate coefficient of desensitization (r),
and the decay of the response contains one desensitizing
component which could be described as a single-exponential
process not significantly changing at different atp concentrations. thus, the kinetics of channel activation and the
pharmacological properties of the p2x2 receptor in 1321n1
glial cells are consistent with previously reported observations (16), establishing a representative assay system for
pharmacological characterization of this receptor.
we have determined a hill coefficient of 2.11 for atp
activation of the p2x2 receptor. these results are similar to
those obtained by brake et al. (5) and ding and sachs (12)
who measured hill coefficients of 2.0 and 2.3, respectively.
although the hill coefficient in some published studies (57,
58) suggests two binding sites for atp, a model indicating
binding of three ligand molecules prior to channel opening
based on results obtained by single-channel recording is
widely accepted (12, 20). this work corroborates the model
based on the binding of three atp molecules for channel
activation. the discrepancy of an overly small hill coefficient
and a three-binding site model can be minimized by
connecting an atp-independent closed state to the open
states (12).
we have studied the mechanisms of inhibition of the rat
p2x2 receptor by tnp-atp, a structural analogue of atp,
and  xxxd3266xxx , the most relevant antagonist of purinergic
receptor, which is not structurally similar with atp. hypotheses published on the inhibition of p2x receptors by
tnp-atp include competitive as well as noncompetitive
mechanisms. for instance, virginio et al. (38) described a
noncompetitive mechanism for inhibition of p2x receptors.
however, a competitive inhibition mechanism of tnp-atp
on heteromeric rat p2x2/3 receptors has been described by
burgard et al. (37). the latter observations are supported by
our experimental data, as follows.
first, the inhibition of p2x2 receptor activity could be
overcome by increasing agonist concentrations.
second, data obtained from whole-cell current recordings
performed at a constant concentration of atp and at various
concentrations of tnp-atp, based on eq 4, obeyed a typical
competitive linear curve fitting when (amax/ai - 1)1/3 was
plotted versus inhibitor concentration (figure 5b), and
allowed to determine the channel opening equilibrium (phi-1)
and inhibition constants (ki) of the receptor in the presence
of tnp-atp. this method had already been used to
differentiate between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition of the serotonin  xxxg1116xxx  by nicotine, cocaine,
and fluoxetine (51).
third, the ratio of the current amplitudes obtained in cellflow experiments in the absence and presence of inhibitor
(eq 7) gave additional support for a competitive mechanism
of inhibition by tnp-atp. according to breitinger et al.
(51) and ramakrishnan and hess (52), a linear relationship
exists between a/ai(x) and inhibitor concentration over a wide
concentration range in the case of a noncompetitive inhibitor
such as  xxxd3266xxx  (0-300 µm). in the case of tnp-atp,

inhibition mechanism of the p2x2 receptor
linearity between a/ai(x) and inhibitor concentration exists
only for a narrow concentration range (0-30 µm), indicating
a competitive mechanism for p2x2 receptor inhibition. for
instance, a proof for the inhibition mechanism of the gabaa
receptor was obtained by using eq 7 (52).
finally, a competitive mechanism of inhibition of the p2x2
receptor by tnp-atp was supported by results from
radioligand-receptor binding assays, where tnp-atp displaced [r-32p]atp from its binding site on p2x2 receptors
in 1321n1 cells. the dissociation constant determined by
binding assays is in agreement with those obtained from
whole-cell measurements, indicating that tnp-atp, in fact,
is a competitive antagonist of nondesensitizing p2x2 receptors.
several published studies suggested that  xxxd3266xxx  is a
competitive antagonist of p2x receptors (24-27). however,
our data have provided clear evidence that  xxxd3266xxx  has the
characteristics of a noncompetitive inhibitor for the p2x2
receptor and does not compete with atp for the ligandbinding site on the receptor. plotting a/ai(x) versus inhibitor
concentration allows us to determine the apparent dissociation constant (kx) of a noncompetitive antagonist. as
expected for a noncompetitive inhibitor, a linear relationship
existed over a 200-fold range of  xxxd3266xxx  concentrations.
nonlinear curve fitting of (amax/ai - 1)1/3 versus inhibitor
concentration indicates that  xxxd3266xxx  is a noncompetitive
inhibitor which binds to a closed-channel form of the
receptor. moreover, the dependence of the obtained wholecell current on the concentration of the agonist atp is
identical in the absence or presence of a constant  xxxd3266xxx 
concentration. as the ec50 was not changed in these
experiments, our data indicate a classical noncompetitive
inhibition mechanism for  xxxd3266xxx .
the results of experiments measuring the level of [r-32p]atp-receptor binding in the presence and absence of
 xxxd3266xxx  showed that  xxxd3266xxx  did not interfere with [r-32p]atp-receptor binding when co-applied with the radioligand
to the cells. discrepancies between receptor binding properties of  xxxd3266xxx  in different tissues have been reported (21,
24, 25). however, we note that in the equilibrium binding
experiments, in which displacement of a radioligand is used
to determine the affinity of an inhibitor like  xxxd3266xxx  to the
receptor, it is not known whether the measurements reflect
the binding to the receptor before or after desensitization,
or even binding to sites other than on the atp receptor.
these ambiguities are avoided by analyzing binding studies
in association with kinetic experiments where one measures
the effect of the specific receptor ligand atp and an inhibitor
on the current resulting from the opening of atp-activated
transmembrane channels (51). in addition, we can ensure
that the obtained current in the presence of atp results only
from p2x2 receptor activation because 1321n1 cells do not
express endogenous purinergic receptors (39, 40), whereas
atp and  xxxd3266xxx  may bind to other proteins on the cell
surface.
claims that  xxxd3266xxx  is a competitive inhibitor of purinergic
receptors go back to 1990 (24), when the p2x2 receptor had
not yet been isolated (5). leff and co-workers described
 xxxd3266xxx  as a slowly equilibrating, competitive antagonist of
p2x receptors in isolated ear arteries from rabbit. most of
those studies indicating a competitive inhibition mechanism
for  xxxd3266xxx  on p2x receptors were carried out using tissue

channels in the open form (ol3i′).

preparations which express a variety of purinergic receptors
(24-26). bianchi and co-workers (17) employed calcium
influx assays to study competitive properties of  xxxd3266xxx  as
a competitive inhibitor. this methodology commonly has a
low time resolution, mostly due to slow ligand exchange
during the measurements. the maximal resolution of fluorescence-based calcium influx assays is in the scale of
seconds, and these measurements are possibly affected by
interference of calcium-reporting fluorophores. fast kinetic
whole-cell recording (cell-flow measurements) achieves a
time resolution of 10 ms, reflecting the direct action of the
ligand on the receptor. wong and co-workers (28) have
studied p2x receptor inhibition by  xxxd3266xxx  in rat hippocampal granule cells using single-channel recording, and have
concluded that a competitive inhibition mechanism for
 xxxd3266xxx  would not be consistent.
thus, our work is the first using a rapid chemical kinetic
technique to compare kinetics and is the basis of understanding the inhibition mechanism of tnp-atp and  xxxd3266xxx  on
the p2x2 receptor expressed in a uniform and silent
background. although purinergic receptors share an endogenous agonist in vivo, they may have different functions on
the basis of tissue distribution, activation kinetics, structure,
and isoforms of the receptor. moreover, the investigation of
the p2x2 receptor in vivo is hindered by the identification
of up to six different splice variants of the rat homologue
(59).
our data obtained from both radioligand binding and fast
kinetic whole-recording studies strongly support a noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition of the rat recombinant p2x2
receptor by  xxxd3266xxx  and confirm the competitive inhibition
by tnp-atp. thus, we suggest the following inhibition
mechanism (figure 9). tnp-atp displaces atp from its
ligand-binding sites on the receptor, thereby preventing
channel opening.  xxxd3266xxx  binds to an allosteric, regulatory
site on the receptor, different from the ligand-binding site.
the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  induces a conformational change
in the closed-channel form of the receptor protein, subse-

quently inhibiting channel opening in the presence of the
ligand atp. the existence of more than one binding site
for  xxxd3266xxx  on the p2x2 receptor cannot be ruled out.
these observations, obtained by a fast kinetic approach,
permit the determination of constants for a chemical mechanism by which these receptors are activated and inhibited
as a function of time and over a wide range of neurotransmitter and inhibitor concentrations, thus contributing to the
knowledge of the signaling process in the nervous system
and the development of therapies for disorders associated
with purinergic receptor dysfunction (60, 61).
