espite preventive measures and improved long-term prognosis, the
prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in the majority of the industrialised
countries is still high. the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, and
the increasing age of the population are the
major contributors to this epidemiological
fact, whose socio-economic consequences
are of profound importance.1-4 over 200,000
people in the us experience recurrent stroke annually, representing 29% of the total
annual number of strokes. 5 considering
that the annual cost of strokes reaches $55.8
billion, recurrent attacks may incur costs of
$16 billion each year.1 in the greek population, the overall incidence of first stroke
reaches 343.6/100,000, ranging from 7.3 to
2661.1/100,000 depending on age and sex.
the 1-year mortality is 35.9% in men and
41.8% in women.6 apparently, the incidence of stroke in our population is relatively
high—possibly because of elevated salt intake and the high prevalence of hypertension.
atherothrombotic episodes are associated with progression of the atheromatous
disease and the influence of haemodynamic
factors. the contribution of a hypercoagulable state is important. platelets have a
central role in the development of arterial
thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular

events. this realisation has made antiplatelet therapy the cornerstone of atherosclerotic disease management. 7,8 numerous
guidelines and recommendations have documented the cardinal role of aspirin administration in the primary and secondary prevention of myocardial ischaemia.1 all patients with acute coronary syndromes should
receive antiplatelet medication, both during
and after the acute episode, with at least
one agent. aspirin remains the first choice
and should be combined with clopidogrel,
which can substitute for aspirin in case the
latter is contraindicated.9-11 for thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation aspirin is an acceptable alternative in
cases where anticoagulants are contraindicated or in patients at low risk for stroke.12,13
prevention of stroke
 xxxd234xxx  50-325 mg/day or 50 mg
plus  xxxd1914xxx  200 mg twice daily are
considered first-line treatment for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with a previous non-cardioembolic cerebrovascular
event. alternatively, clopidogrel alone can
be used. in the 2008 guidelines for stroke
management from the european stroke
organization,  xxxd3435xxx  was for the first time
recommended as lone therapy, as an alternative to the above-mentioned medica(hellenic journal of cardiology) hjc ñ 199

tions for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic
stroke. this recommendation was based on the doubleblind, randomised tacip and tapirss trials, which
found  xxxd3435xxx  to be equally as effective as aspirin in
preventing post-stroke vascular events, while having a
more favourable safety profile.14-16
in the early postoperative period following valve replacement with a bioprosthesis, anticoagulation with
heparin and subsequently  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists or aspirin is endorsed, depending on the valve replaced.
among surgical centres remarkable variety is observed
regarding the antithrombotic medication. small clinical
trials suggest that antiplatelet therapy with ticlopidine
or  xxxd3435xxx  is a promising alternative to warfarin for the
primary prevention of thromboembolism in this clinical
setting.17-19

impressive clinical outcomes for the post-surgical prophylaxis of venous thrombosis. in animal models melagatran has been proven effective in preventing thrombus formation in mechanical valves.30 anti- xxxg741xxx  rivaroxaban and otamixaban are potent antithrombotic
factors, comparable to enoxaparin and unfractionated
heparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery and in percutaneous coronary interventions, respectively.31,32 however, safety concerns related to liver enzyme elevations
and thrombosis rebound have been reported with their
use.33 newly studied antiplatelet agents, such as prasugrel, present a significant reduction in ischaemic events
compared to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndromes,
but at the cost of a significant increase in major bleeding.34

problems related to treatment with aspirin

 xxxd3435xxx 

despite the well established effective clinical functions
and the universal acceptance aspirin enjoys, its administration in various settings, such as in the geriatric population, is frequently problematic because of an increased risk of bleeding complications, especially in the
presence of other comorbidities and concomitant use of
other drugs. gastrointestinal bleeding is a widely recognised consequence associated with acetylsalicylic use; it
is dose related and potentially severe.20,21 even low dosage administration in individuals over 60 years of age
can be blamed for almost 1/3 of all severe episodes of
gastrointestinal haemorrhage. aspirin also exhibits frequent adverse effects in patients with asthma, chronic
sinusitis and nasal polyps.22 furthermore, its therapeutic action, like that of clopidogrel, is reduced in a significant part of the population that may reach 15%,23 as a
result of genetically controlled mechanisms of resistance.24-27 certain controversy exists regarding its use in
cases of g-6pd deficiency, although the frequency of
haemolytic complications is low, and its administration
seems safe, especially in low doses.28,29
in other words, it has become evident that the use
of antithrombotic drugs is far from optimised, mostly
because of difficulty in their use and adverse effects.
therefore, the introduction of new agents with sufficient effectiveness, fewer cases of drug resistance, and
with a reduced potential for treatment-related bleeding or airway over-responsiveness would represent a
useful addition to the therapeutic options available at
this time.
both the anti- xxxg741xxx  and antithrombin agents
have been developed for oral use and have provided

 xxxd3435xxx  represents a challenging and promising alternative to aspirin. it is chemically related to  xxxd234xxx  and inhibits cycloxygenase-1 in platelets,
but seems to leave intact the  xxxd208xxx  metabolic pathway in endothelial cells. it also favours the
production of no and increases the concentration of
cyclic nucleotides. thanks to this multiplicity of actions, this drug presents comparable antiplatelet activity to aspirin while presenting a more favourable
safety profile.35

chemical properties and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3435xxx 
 xxxd3435xxx , or 2-acetyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl  xxxd306xxx ,
is structurally related to  xxxd234xxx , although its
chemical synthesis is different, having a trifluoromethyl
group in position 4 (figure 1). it is produced as white
crystals with a melting point of 110æc.36 the drug is administered orally. it is absorbed in the small intestine
and its bioavailability ranges from 83% to 100%.37,38 it
binds to plasma proteins almost entirely (99%) and
crosses organic barriers readily. during passage through
the liver it is deacetylated, forming its main metabolite
2-oh-4-trifluoromethyl  xxxd306xxx  (htb). the halflife of  xxxd3435xxx  in healthy humans is 0.5 ± 0.1 h, while
that of htb is 34.3 ± 5.3 h. elimination is primarily renal. unchanged  xxxd3435xxx , htb and htb glycine conjugate have been identified in the urine. renal clearance
is 0.8 ± 0.2 l/h and 0.18 ± 0.04 l/h for  xxxd3435xxx  and
htb, respectively. steady state for htb is reached after 8-10 days of treatment.39,40
the concentration of htb in the cerebrospinal

fluid ranges from 0.011-0.341 ìg/ml, which is reported
to be within a range that may, according to in vitro data from a study in human neuroblastoma cells, have a
protective effect in alzheimer’s disease.41 the pharmacokinetic profiles of  xxxd3435xxx  or htb do not appear to have clinically significant differences in elderly or younger volunteers.35,40 no plasma accumulation
of the parent compound was noticed in volunteers >80
years old who received  xxxd3435xxx  300 mg × 2/day for 13
days.42 although values for t1/2 were greater in elderly
compared to younger individuals ( xxxd3435xxx  0.92 h vs.
0.53 h, htb 64.6 h vs. 34.3 h) such differences were
not considered to be clinically significant or to necessitate dosage adjustments in aged people. conventional haemodialysis is reported to have no major influence on plasma htb concentrations.35
as mentioned above, at therapeutic concentrations 98-99% of htb is bound to plasma proteins.
this binding is not significantly influenced by theophylline, enalapril, caffeine or warfarin, but the free
fraction of this compound is increased by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen,
 xxxd2969xxx , naproxen). furthermore htb may, in high
concentrations, impair protein binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glisentide or warfarin35 and therefore may increase their free fractions
and require dosage reductions.
in contrast to other inhibitors of prostaglandin
synthesis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs or aspirin,  xxxd3435xxx , probably because of its multiple mechanisms of action, seems to interfere to a
lesser degree with the effectiveness of antihypertensive medication. data from the tacip study suggest
that the need for antihypertensive therapy was signifi-

cantly less in  xxxd3435xxx  than in aspirin recipients.43,44 in
the specific case of  xxxg36xxx 
inhibitors, an analysis of the tim study reported that
concurrent administration of aspirin, but not  xxxd3435xxx ,
may impede their antihypertensive action and potentially affect patient survival. 45 notably, the recommended dosage in adults is 600-900 mg/day, administered as a single dose of 600 mg or in two or three doses
of 300 mg, preferably during or after meals.
mechanism of action
 xxxd3435xxx  inhibits platelet aggregation and interaction
with subendothelium. its effect has been documented
in experimental animals and in humans in in vitro and
ex vivo studies and in in vivo models of thrombogenesis
in animals.46-48 the drug irreversibly inhibits  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) and reduces thromboxane b2
(txb2) production, but to a lesser degree compared to
aspirin, and its action declines within 30 days from withdrawal.49 the reduction in serum 6-keto prostaglandin
f1 levels was negligible with  xxxd3435xxx  (8.8% vs. 97.8%
with aspirin), suggesting that this compound inhibits
cox-1 and  xxxd208xxx  metabolism selectively in
platelets, sparing the metabolic function of vascular endothelial cells. the main metabolite, htb, is pharmacologically active;  xxxd3435xxx  is more potent in inhibiting
cox-1 and reducing txb2 than htb but is less potent than aspirin. however, htb potentiates  xxxd3435xxx ’s
effect on cox-1 inhibition, whereas aspirin’s metabolite,  xxxd3159xxx , competes with the parent compound
for its binding to cox.48
in vitro,  xxxd3435xxx  inhibits platelet aggregation with a
significantly smaller ic50 when tested in whole blood
(hellenic journal of cardiology) hjc ñ 201

h. anninos et al

compared to platelet rich plasma. this fact suggests
that red blood cells may somehow enhance the drug’s
anti-aggregant properties. in studies regarding the
platelet-endothelium interactions, where blood from
volunteers receiving  xxxd3435xxx  or aspirin circulates in
contact with rabbit aorta subendothelium,  xxxd3435xxx  reduced platelet coverage by 92% (aspirin: 62%). the
arterial area occupied by aggregates was reduced by
89% (aspirin 75%). the surface occupied by adhesions (platelets spread and firmly bound onto the
subendothelium forming layers <5 ìm, a function dependent on decreased levels of  xxxd1773xxx , camp) was reduced by 25% (aspirin
3%).40
moreover,  xxxd3435xxx , via stimulation of the constitutive activity of no synthase (cnos), enhances the production of no by neutrophils by 150%, whereas aspirin
does so by 60%. it also increases levels of cyclic  xxxd1067xxx  and inhibits camp phosphodiesterase, leading to a rise in camp levels and thus a decrease in calcium mobilisation and subsequent platelet
aggregation.40
ex vivo, in rat brain slices  xxxd3435xxx  was more potent than  xxxd234xxx  in reducing anoxia-reperfusion related cell death (21-47% vs. 0-26%) and other indices of cerebral oxidative stress (25-30% vs. 024% decrease in  xxxg1578xxx  [inos]
activity, 30-40% vs. 0-35% decrease in lipid peroxidation).50 in vitro, in human mononuclear cells, it reduced the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  which is a gene expression regulatory factor participating among other things
in the control of transcription of cytokine and cox-2
genes.  xxxd3435xxx  also inhibits vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 mrna expression51,52 as well as the production of various cytokines, such as interferon-á, interleukins il-2,  xxxg1177xxx  and il-8, and tumour necrosis
factor-alpha (tnf-·).53
in vivo animal models studies have established
the antiplatelet action of  xxxd3435xxx . brain ischaemia in
rats—induced by intracarotid injection of arachidonic
acid, which causes the formation of multiple small
thrombi—is significantly reduced after the chronic
administration of  xxxd3435xxx  (60% protection compared
to 27% with equivalent dose of aspirin).54 similar results are obtained when brain ischaemia is provoked
by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or electrical stimulation of the carotid artery.55,56
in humans,  xxxd3435xxx  has been found more effective than  xxxd234xxx  in platelet aggregation inhibition, using electrical impedance aggregometry in
whole blood. however, in a comparative study in
202 ñ hjc (hellenic journal of cardiology)

healthy volunteers, bleeding time was not significantly
different from baseline after 3-7 days of 600-900
mg/day  xxxd3435xxx  administration.57
apart from its antithrombotic effect,  xxxd3435xxx  is
thought to reduce the damage caused to the nervous
system by various insults, such as ischaemic or cytotoxic, acting directly on this specific tissue. given in
a dosage of 30 mg/kg it reduced brain lesions provoked by n-ch3-d aspartate (nmda) injection,58,59
while in doses of 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg it showed a neuroprotective action against anoxia-reperfusion damage in rat brain slices. in this setting it diminished
ldh activity by 21%, 42% and 47%, respectively. 60
 xxxd234xxx  exhibited a dose-dependent but
quantitatively more limited effect. similar differences
between the two drugs were observed regarding their
influence on the biochemical pathways of brain damage (oxidative stress, prostaglandin accumulation,
no pathways).60 several sites of action in the nervous tissue, which are interrelated via biochemical
pathways with well established involvement in neuronal damage, have been proposed to account for the
neuroprotective properties of this drug.  xxxd3435xxx  inhibits the excess lipid peroxidation resulting from
anoxia-reoxygenation. htb, on the other hand, enhances the endogenous glutathione antioxidant system in addition to inhibiting lipid peroxidation. 50
 xxxd3435xxx ’s various actions are summarised and depicted in figure 2.
both the parent compound and the active metabolite not only decrease the prostaglandin synthesis and accumulation observed in ischaemic brain tissue as a result of anoxia-reoxygenation,60 but they also interfere with the no pathway. excess production
of no leads to formation of peroxynitrites, which are
highly reactive radicals and extremely toxic for the
neuronal cells. these drugs substantially reduce the
availability of free radicals, as a result of their antioxidant potential, and also decrease the activity of inos
more powerfully than does  xxxd234xxx . as a
result, they limit the excessive synthesis of no by the
ischaemic neuronal tissue. finally, as they also inhibit the inducible cox pathway (cox-2), they hinder
the expression of numerous inflammatory mediators,
such as il-1‚ and tnf-·, as evident in models of
nmda neurotoxicity. 58 this effect appears to be
mediated by a reduction of  xxxg1559xxx  synthesis and desensitisation of neurons to its action. 50,52,59,61 this
mechanism has been proposed to underlie  xxxd3435xxx ’s
neuroprotective properties in an experimental model of neurodegenerative diseases.62

clinical trials
several studies have been designed and conducted to
evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of novel antiplatelet medication in different clinical settings. the
tim study was undertaken to determine whether  xxxd3435xxx  provides an efficacy advantage over aspirin in the
prevention of vascular complications following acute
myocardial infarction (ami) and to qualify the relative
safety benefit of the two drugs. it was a double blinded,
randomised sequential parallel group study carried out
at 29 centres in spain, portugal and italy, in which 2275
patients with established ami were randomised to receive either  xxxd3435xxx  600 mg/day or aspirin 300 mg/day
for 35 days starting within the first 24 h after the onset
of symptoms. the primary endpoint was a composite of
death or non-fatal mi or non-fatal cerebrovascular
event within 35 days. secondary endpoints were defined
individually as the incidence of death, non-fatal re-infarction, non-fatal cerebrovascular event, or urgent
revascularisation procedure in the same period. drug

tolerability and safety, with particular regard to bleeding episodes, were also assessed.63 there were no significant differences between treatments in the primary
endpoints, the risk of death, non-fatal mi or revascularisation procedures. the risk of non-fatal cerebrovascular events was significantly lower with  xxxd3435xxx  (63% less
compared to aspirin). as far as adverse effects are concerned, the most frequently affected system was the
gastrointestinal tract and the central and peripheral
nervous system, with a similar incidence in both treatment groups. however,  xxxd3435xxx  was associated with a
lower incidence of central nervous system bleeding
(p=0.033) and with a non-significant trend towards
less frequent bleeding in all organs (p=0.09).63
the tacip study, a randomised, double blinded
multi-centre trial, enrolled 2113 patients over 40 years
of age with transient ischaemic attacks (tia) or nondisabling stroke of neither haemorrhagic nor cardioembolic nature in the past 6 months. they were randomised to receive  xxxd3435xxx  600 mg/day or aspirin 325
mg/day for no less than 1 year and up to 3 years. prima(hellenic journal of cardiology) hjc ñ 203

ry endpoints included vascular death, non-fatal ischaemic stroke or non-fatal mi. secondary events were
the occurrence of these events separately, as well as
overall mortality, non-vascular death, non-fatal or any
ischaemic stroke, non-fatal or any mi, any cerebral
haemorrhage, and major systemic haemorrhage (requiring blood transfusion or hospital admission). no
significant differences were noted with regard to the
primary or secondary endpoints, except for the incidence of bleeding episodes: 2.9% of aspirin and 1.2%
of  xxxd3435xxx  recipients reported at least one major systemic haemorrhage, while 4% in the aspirin group and
1.9% in the  xxxd3435xxx  group suffered cerebral or major
systemic haemorrhagic episodes. patients treated with
aspirin showed a significantly higher overall incidence
of bleeding adverse events (25% vs. 15.2%).14 notably,
the 95% confidence intervals calculated for the relative
effect of  xxxd3435xxx  compared to aspirin were wide and
thus the study would not show a superior efficacy of any
treatment option; instead it documents that a substantial difference is unlikely.14
the tapirss study was a multi-centre, double
blinded, randomised, parallel group pilot clinical trial
to develop data sufficient to conduct a larger trial in
latin america. four hundred and thirty-one patients
were recruited in 19 centres in argentina among individuals 40 or more years old with tia or established
non-disabling cerebral infarction, non-haemorrhagic
and non-cardioembolic, in the previous 6 months. the
patients were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd3435xxx  600
mg/day or  xxxd234xxx /day for a mean of 586 days.
primary endpoints included vascular death, non-fatal ischaemic stroke, non-fatal mi or major bleeding; secondary outcome events were the occurrence of each of
the above separately, as well as minor bleeding, nonvascular death or systemic thromboembolism. follow
up extended from 1 to 2 years. no significant differences were observed in terms of either primary or
secondary endpoints; although in the  xxxd3435xxx  group
there were significantly more non-lacunar/large vessel
infarcts, which are associated with a higher incidence
of recurrence that reaches 9% annual risk compared
to 6.1% for lacunar defects. however, the  xxxd3435xxx 
treated patients showed a favourable trend in bleeding events, with 0.5% major and 2.3% minor haemorrhages in comparison to 3.2% and 6%, respectively, in
the aspirin group. in a post hoc analysis, all bleeding
episodes were significantly more frequent in aspirintreated subjects, the gastrointestinal tract being the
dominant affected system.15
in primary prevention,  xxxd3435xxx ’s usefulness has
204 ñ hjc (hellenic journal of cardiology)

been evaluated in preventing embolism in cases of
atrial fibrillation (af). the naspeaf study compared the efficacy of  xxxd3435xxx  600 mg/day alone, in
combination with  xxxd59xxx  (inr 1.25-2.4), or
 xxxd59xxx  alone (inr 2-3), in patients with
chronic or paroxysmal af. individuals at high risk of
stroke (non-valvular af with antecedents of embolism, mitral stenosis) received  xxxd59xxx  or the
combination of the two drugs. the primary endpoint
was a composite of vascular death, tia, non-fatal
stroke, or systemic embolism. in the intermediate risk
group the incidence of the primary endpoint was significantly lower with the combined therapy than with
 xxxd3435xxx  or  xxxd59xxx  alone (0.92% vs. 3.8% vs.
2.7%, respectively). in the group of high-risk patients
the combination was again more effective, showing a
2.44% incidence of the primary endpoint, compared
to 4.7% in the  xxxd59xxx  alone arm.64 another
study comparing  xxxd3435xxx  (600 mg/day) with  xxxd59xxx  (inr 2-3) over an endpoint including thromboembolism, severe haemorrhage, or death related to
vascular disease, in subjects undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement with bioprostheses, failed to
document any significant differences after a follow up
of 30 days.17
in individuals undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting, 9 days’ postoperative angiographic evaluation showed no significant difference in the rate of
vein graft occlusion between aspirin 50 mg and  xxxd3435xxx  300 mg, both administered in combination with
 xxxd1914xxx  75 mg three times a day. nevertheless,
re-evaluation after 6 months disclosed that the combination incorporating  xxxd3435xxx  was superior in terms
of maintaining vein graft patency.65
in a prospective, randomised, double-blind study
with 459 patients operated on for a hip fracture and
receiving unfractionated heparin,  xxxd3435xxx  300 mg and
aspirin 200 mg thrice daily appeared equally affective
in preventing deep vein thrombosis (dvt) or pulmonary embolism. similar results regarding dvt incidence were obtained from another small randomised, double-blind trial enrolling 99 patients who
received 250 mg of aspirin or 300 mg of  xxxd3435xxx  3
times a day after hip surgery.66,67
adverse reactions/tolerability
traditionally, antiplatelet drugs have been associated
with an increased risk of bleeding complications.
aspirin increases the risk of severe extracranial haemorrhage by approximately 50%.68,69 this is equivalent to

old drugs in modern therapeutics:  xxxd3435xxx 

1-2 severe bleeding episodes per 1000 patients per year
and 1-2 haemorrhagic strokes per 10,000 patients per
year.70
the clinical trials evaluating  xxxd3435xxx ’s efficacy and
safety showed that the rates of withdrawal and the incidence of side effects did not differ significantly between
study groups, but the severity of the adverse events deserves further discussion. major systemic haemorrhages
were significantly lower with  xxxd3435xxx  administration
compared to aspirin.14,15,63 this reduction was also evident in individuals receiving fibrinolytic therapy.63 as
expected,  xxxd3435xxx  appears safer with regard to haemorrhagic events compared to  xxxd59xxx  (inr 2-3) or
the combination of the two (inr 1.25-2.4).64 a metaanalysis by costa et al71 revealed that, although the frequency of non-haemorrhagic complications (abdominal
pain, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer) was significantly higher in
patients treated with  xxxd3435xxx , the incidence of haemorrhagic complications (fatal or non-fatal haemorrhagic
stroke, intracranial or major systemic haemorrhage)
was significantly lower than in aspirin-treated patients.
in terms of gastrointestinal complaints, which were the
most widely reported, dyspepsia was more frequent
among  xxxd3435xxx -receiving participants, while peptic ulcer was reported mainly by aspirin recipients.
usually, individuals on antiplatelet medication are
also receiving other drugs for concomitant conditions;
these complicate therapy and make the evaluation of
drug interactions necessary, but difficult. unlike aspirin,  xxxd3435xxx  is less likely to interfere with the efficacy
of antihypertensive drugs, especially angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, as suggested by data from
the tacip study.14 however, htb interacts with the
serum protein binding of other pharmacological agents
(non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glisentide, warfarin) to the same degree as aspirin, so that precautions
must be taken when  xxxd3435xxx  is used in combination
with these substances.72,73
conclusions
current clinical practice with regard to antiplatelet
therapy is highly demanding. this is not only a direct
consequence of the high prevalence of cardiovascular
diseases, but it is also a result of the realisation of the
importance of platelet activity in the pathogenesis of
the so-called atherothrombotic procedure. in the
light of evolving, long-awaited new antithrombotic
drugs that will shortly claim a role in everyday clinical
practice, we ought to also take into consideration the
established effectiveness of older drugs. moreover,

the demographic changes in our population emphasise the need for safer drugs, given that the side effects
of antiplatelet medications are even more prominent in
elderly people, who represent the main candidates for
such treatments.  xxxd3435xxx  is an antiplatelet agent that is
chemically related to aspirin and has similar effectiveness, but appears to have a better tolerability profile.
empirical data and results from large-scale clinical
trials suggest that its use may be preferable to that of
aspirin, in several clinical settings where antiplatelet
therapy is indicated. in selected populations, such as
in geriatric patients or in cases of aspirin resistance,
 xxxd3435xxx  may be a choice worth considering. furthermore, when combination antiplatelet-fibrinolytic or
antiplatelet-anticoagulant therapy is needed, clinical
data support  xxxd3435xxx  use based on its efficacy and better safety than aspirin.
although more large scale trials comparing antiplatelet drugs in various clinical settings would be
useful in the effort to determine each agent’s particular role in therapeutics, use of  xxxd3435xxx  where indicated is an attractive therapeutic option, especially when
safety and cost-effectiveness are prioritised.
