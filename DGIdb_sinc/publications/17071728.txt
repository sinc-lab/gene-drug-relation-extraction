doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00969.2006.— xxxd2878xxx  (pps) is a
heparin-like polysaccharide that can affect the binding interactions of
fibroblast growth factor ( xxxg787xxx ) with its high-affinity receptors.
patients with angiogenic tumors frequently show high levels of  xxxg787xxx 
in the circulation. since  xxxg787xxx  is a heparin-binding angiogenic
growth factor, pps has been used successfully to block its activity in
patients with angiogenic tumors. however, because of its heparin-like
activity, the major toxic effect of pps is the development of bleeding
disorders. the role that circulating  xxxg787xxx  plays in the pathogenesis of
bleeding disorders in patients treated with pps is currently unknown.
here we hypothesized that  xxxg787xxx  might play a physiological role in
the pathogenesis of intestinal bleeding induced by pps. this hypothesis is supported by previous studies showing that pps is accumulated
in the intestine and that circulating  xxxg787xxx  specifically binds to and
modulates the angiogenic activity of intestinal submucosal endothelial
cells. we used recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying a secreted
form of  xxxg787xxx  and lacz control vectors to determine whether high
levels of circulating  xxxg787xxx  facilitate the development of intestinal
bleeding disorders in fvb/n and c57bl/6j mice treated with pps.
we found that pps, acting together with  xxxg787xxx , induced structural
changes in intestinal vessels leading to the development of lethal
intestinal hemorrhages. these findings might have wider clinical
implications for the systemic use of pps and other heparinoids in the
treatment of patients with angiogenic diseases associated with high
levels of circulating  xxxg787xxx .
heparinoids; abdominal hemorrhages; angiogenesis; coagulation; heparin binding receptors
 xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx ) is a heparin-binding
growth factor that is involved in several biological processes,
including angiogenesis, tumor growth, and healing of gastrointestinal tissues (5, 7). although  xxxg787xxx  lacks a signal peptide
for secretion, it can be released into the circulation through
nonconventional pathways by injured endothelial cells or angiogenic tumors (5, 7, 13).  xxxg787xxx  released into the circulation
can be accumulated on the cell surface and basement membranes bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspg) (11,
32). in this manner, hspg can modulate the activity of  xxxg787xxx

by preventing its proteolytic degradation and/or affecting the
signaling through its high-affinity receptors (18, 27). on the
basis of this notion, heparin-like molecules or heparinoids have
been widely used to modulate the biological activity of  xxxg787xxx 
in the treatment of human diseases (3–5, 10).1
 xxxd2878xxx  (pps), a semisynthetic sulfated heparinoid polysaccharide, can antagonize the binding of  xxxg787xxx  to
its cell surface receptors and has been shown to modulate the
angiogenic activity of  xxxg787xxx  in human and mouse tumors (16,
22, 30, 34). however, its use as an  xxxg482xxx  in
humans is limited by its heparin-like anticoagulant activity,
which leads to the development of bleeding disorders in several
tissues, including the intestine (16, 22). to date, the mechanism by which pps induces intestinal bleeding in humans
remains unclear. thus it is necessary to understand this
process, because it may have wider implications for the use
of heparinoids in the treatment of patients with angiogenic
tumors, gastrointestinal ulcers, and inflammatory disorders
(3–5).
since high levels of  xxxg787xxx  are found in the circulation of
patients with angiogenic tumors (5), we hypothesized that
 xxxg787xxx  might play an important physiological role in the
pathogenesis of the intestinal hemorrhages induced by pps.
this hypothesis is supported by previous studies showing that
pps has heparin-like activity and accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract (20). in addition, circulating  xxxg787xxx  binds to and
modulates the growth of intestinal submucosal endothelial cells
(21). in this study, we describe a new disease mechanism of
intestinal bleeding induced by the combined effects of pps and
 xxxg787xxx .
materials and methods

recombinant adenoviral vectors. recombinant adenoviral (rad)
vectors carrying either the escherichia coli lacz gene (rad-lacz) or
a 700-bp cdna sequence encoding a secreted form of human  xxxg787xxx 
(rad- xxxg787xxx ) were generated, amplified, and purified as previously
described (8 –12, 33). the particle-to-plaque-forming unit (pfu) ratio
of the virus stock used in the experiments was 100.

indicated otherwise.
results

pps increases the recruitment of  xxxg787xxx  in the intestine. to
determine whether pps increased the recruitment of circulating
 xxxg787xxx  in the intestine, mice were injected intravenously with
125
i- xxxg787xxx  (0.1 ng/100 ␮l) in the presence or absence of pps
(fig. 1a). in agreement with previous studies (31), 125i- xxxg787xxx 
was rapidly cleared from the circulation within minutes and
was accumulated predominately in the liver and kidney (fig. 1,
a–c). in contrast, preincubation of 125i- xxxg787xxx  with pps, to
allow the formation of a pps- xxxg787xxx  complex, changed the
pattern of  xxxg787xxx  distribution, increasing its accumulation in
the intestine and kidney and decreasing its accumulation in the
liver (fig. 1b). moreover, by immunohistochemistry,  xxxg787xxx 
was localized in the extracellular matrix and submucosal intestinal vessels of these mice (fig. 2b).
pps and  xxxg787xxx  induce lethal intestinal hemorrhages in
mice. since patients with angiogenic diseases can be exposed
to high levels of circulating  xxxg787xxx  for prolonged periods of
time (4, 5), we developed a mouse model to mimic this
condition. because  xxxg787xxx  injected intravenously is rapidly
cleared from the circulation, all mice were injected with rad
vectors carrying the dna sequence encoding a secreted form
of human  xxxg787xxx  (rad- xxxg787xxx ) (8). as shown in fig. 1c, the
peak levels of circulating  xxxg787xxx  were detected 7 days after the
initial infection. next, to determine whether  xxxg787xxx  and pps
acting together induced intestinal bleeding disorders in mice,
five groups of 5-wk-old fvb/n male mice (n ⫽ 5 mice per
group) were treated with either 1) rad- xxxg787xxx  (5 ⫻ 108
pfu/mouse); 2) rad- xxxg787xxx  ⫹ pps (60 mg/kg weekly, ip); 3)
rad vectors carrying the lacz gene (18) (5 ⫻ 108 pfu/mouse);
4) rad-lacz ⫹ pps (60 mg/kg weekly, ip) or 5) pps alone
(same dose). this pps dose was selected because it did not
induce adverse effects in mice (30, 34), and our preliminary
studies showed no significant bleeding disorders in 26 mice
followed for 2– 4 wk. thus, as expected, all mice injected with
rad- xxxg787xxx  alone, rad-lacz alone, or pps alone and those
mice injected with rad-lacz plus pps did not develop hemorrhages and remained in good health throughout the 3 wk of
study (fig. 1d). however, in remarkable contrast, all mice
injected with rad- xxxg787xxx  in combination with pps developed
intestinal hemorrhages and died within the first 2 wk of
treatment (fig. 1d). these results were reproduced in female
fvb/n and c57bl/6j mice (n ⫽ 5 mice per group; data not
shown), confirming that this phenomenon was neither sex nor
strain specific. finally, these experiments were repeated in a
larger number of fvb/n male mice. from a total of 38 mice
injected with rad- xxxg787xxx  ⫹ pps (60 mg/kg per week), 12 mice
(⬃32%) died within 48 h, showing mean serum  xxxg787xxx  levels
of 150 ⫾ 50 pg/ml (mean ⫾ sd). this concentration is within
the biological range of the  xxxg787xxx  levels detected in the
circulation of children at high risk of developing intestinal
bleeding (23, 24). the remaining mice died after they received
the second dose of pps, showing higher serum levels of  xxxg787xxx 
(14 ⫾ 4 ng/ml; mean ⫾ sd).
to determine the relative contribution of the pps dose in this
process, additional groups of mice were injected with a lower
dose of pps (20 mg/kg weekly, ip) in combination with

animal model. the animal care was approved by the children’s
research institute animal care and use committee. fvb/n or
c57bl/6j mice, 6 – 8 wk old, were purchased from taconic (germantown, md). mice were injected retro-orbitally with 5 ⫻ 108 pfu/
mouse of each rad vector as described before (33).  xxxd2878xxx  (bene arzneimittel; munich, germany), was injected intraperitoneally every week. the pps dosing schedule was selected based
on the results of previous studies (30, 34), which showed that pps was
effective and safe in the treatment of experimental mouse tumors. in
addition, we did not give multiple daily injections of pps to avoid
prolonging the anticoagulant activity of pps. for the single bolus
experiments, recombinant human (rh)  xxxg787xxx  was purchased from
biosource (camarillo, ca). the level of endotoxin contamination of
this preparation was below ⬍0.1 ng/␮g protein. the size of the
hemorrhages was assessed by using the following arbitrary score:
grade 1, no macroscopic bleeding visible; grade 2, congestion of
vessels and minor capillary blood leaks (⬍10 mm); grade 3, localized
hemorrhages (10 –50 mm); grade 4, multiple and/or larger hemorrhages (⬎50 mm); and grade 5, lethal hemorrhages.
125
i-labeled  xxxg787xxx  administration. 125i-labeled  xxxg787xxx  (125ifgf-2; amersham, arlington heights, il) was diluted with rh- xxxg787xxx 
(r&d systems, minneapolis mn) to a specific activity of 1 ␮ci/ng of
 xxxg787xxx . mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (70 and 7
mg/kg body wt, respectively), and 0.1 ng of 125i- xxxg787xxx  in 100 ␮l
normal saline was injected retro-orbitally in the right eye. in some
mice, pps (5 mg/ml) was added to 125i- xxxg787xxx  and incubated for 30
min before the injection. subsequently, 20-␮l blood samples were
collected from the left eye by retro-orbital bleeding at the different
time points as described in fig. 1. the radioactivity of each blood
sample and tissue was measured with a gamma counter (gamma
5500b; beckman coulter, fullerton, ca). serum levels of  xxxg787xxx 
were analyzed by elisa as previously described (23). western blots
for  xxxg787xxx  were done as described before (23, 24).
histological analysis. for the light microcopy studies, 4-␮m sections from the liver, kidney, lung, bladder, spleen, and intestine were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the electron microscopy studies
were done using standard methods in selected tissues fixed in 3%
glutaraldehyde and 0.2 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.2. the immunostaining was performed using the histostain sp kit (zymed, south san
francisco, ca) (24). two polyclonal rabbit antibodies against  xxxg787xxx ,
from sigma and chemicon international (temecula, ca), were used.
the  xxxg2423xxx  antibody from dako (carpinteria, ca) was
used to stain endothelial cells. the size of these vessels was assessed
in five randomly selected microscopic fields (⫻25) per mouse, by
measuring its diameter (in ␮m) using a computer-assisted image
analysis software (optimas version 6.2; media cybernetics, silver
spring, md).
bleeding time and coagulation studies. the bleeding time was
measured after severing a 5-mm segment of the tail. pieces of filter
paper were dipped  xxxd1891xxx -s intervals into the blood oozing from
amputated tail until the presence of a clot in the tail was detected or
for 4 min. for the clotting studies, whole blood was collected from
anesthetized mice after a cardiac puncture (nine parts of blood were
mixed with one part of a 3.8% sodium citrate solution). the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) were
measured using the amax-200 coagulation analyzer (trinity biotech, wicklow, ireland) as per manufacturer’s recommendation. mean
platelet counts (1,000/␮l) were determined by manual counting in
triplicate.
statistical analysis. differences between two groups were compared using the student’s t-test and two-tailed p values. when more
than two means were compared, we used one-way anova followed
by multiple comparisons using the student-newman-keuls test. the
kruskal-wallis nonparametric test was used to analyze the aptt and
bleeding results. survival curves were analyzed using the kaplanmeier survival analysis, using the log-rank test with the graphpad
prism 4 software (san diego, ca). p values ⬍0.05 were considered

modulation of coagulation status. to determine whether
 xxxg787xxx  induced the development of lethal intestinal hemorrhages by enhancing the anticoagulant activity of pps, additional fvb/n mice were injected with pps alone or in combination with adenoviruses carrying lacz or  xxxg787xxx  as described in materials and methods. since the most relevant
anticoagulant activity of pps is to prolong the aptt and the
bleeding time (28), we explored these coagulation functions in
mice injected with pps, rad-lacz, or rad- xxxg787xxx  alone or in
combination. as expected, within the first hours after the
injection, pps alone or in combination with rad-lacz or
rad- xxxg787xxx  prolonged the aptt and the bleeding times in all
experimental groups of mice when compared with mice not
injected with pps. appt results (in s) were as follows: control,
25 ⫾ 3; rad-lacz alone, 20 ⫾ 2; rad. xxxg787xxx  alone, 21 ⫾ 2.5
vs. pps alone ⬎300 (p ⬍ 0.0001, using the kruskal-wallis

0.0001, using the kruskal-wallis test; n ⫽ 5–14). in contrast,
both the appt and bleeding times measured in similar groups
of mice 7 days after a single injection of pps (60 mg/kg) were
within the normal physiological range (appt ⫽ 19 –23 s;
bleeding time ⫽ 120 –170 s). in summary, despite the initial
anticoagulant changes induced by pps alone or in combination
with rad-lacz, only mice injected with pps ⫹ rad- xxxg787xxx 
developed intestinal bleeding. these findings suggest that, in
addition to the anticoagulant activity of pps, the structural
endothelial changes induced by  xxxg787xxx  ⫹ pps are required to
induce intestinal bleeding.
discussion

in the present study, we have generated a new mouse model
of lethal intestinal hemorrhages and described a new role of
 xxxg787xxx  in the pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder. more
specifically, we showed that pps increases the recruitment of
circulating  xxxg787xxx  in the intestine and that both factors, acting
together, induce structural changes in intestinal vessels leading
to the leakage of blood in the intestinal submucosa and peritoneum.
the notion that  xxxg787xxx  induces specific proangiogenic
changes in submucosal intestinal vessels is consistent with the
results of paris et al. (21). they showed that  xxxg787xxx  prevented
radiation-induced apoptosis of submucosal intestinal endothelial cells by acting specifically through fgf high-affinity
receptors located in these cells (21). although it could be
argued that pps should antagonize, rather than increase, the
action of  xxxg787xxx  on intestinal endothelial cells by blocking its
interaction with its cell surface receptors, previous studies have
shown that the inhibitory effects of pps could be fully reversed
by adding more  xxxg787xxx  (30). in addition, the presence of hspg
in vascular structures with specific inhibitory or stimulatory

rad- xxxg787xxx  (n ⫽ 21) or rad-lacz (n ⫽ 5). in a similar manner,
we found that 12% of the mice injected with rad- xxxg787xxx  plus
pps died of lethal intestinal hemorrhages (fig. 1d). in contrast, all mice injected with a similar dose of pps in combination with rad-lacz remained in excellent health and did not
develop intestinal hemorrhages during the study period (fig.
1d). a detailed histological analysis of hematoxylin and eosinstained sections harvested from the liver, spleen, kidney, and
gastrointestinal tissues of mice injected with rad- xxxg787xxx  plus
pps showed that the bleeding was initially localized to the
intestinal submucosa; however, the structure of intestinal epithelial cells of the crypts or villae remained intact (fig. 2, c
and d). furthermore, during the early bleeding stages, we did
not find evidence of gastrointestinal ulcers and/or histological
changes in the liver, spleen, or systemic vasculature that could
explain the development of intestinal hemorrhages. in the least
severe cases, the hemorrhages were small and remained encapsulated in the intestinal submucosa of mice that survived. in
contrast, in the lethal cases, large hemorrhages resulted from
the leakage of blood from large mesenteric vessels as well as
the disruption of the intestinal mucosa and the accumulation of
blood in the intestinal lumen and peritoneal cavity (fig. 1, f
and g). these findings indicate that both  xxxg787xxx  and pps are
essential for the development of submucosal intestinal hemorrhages and that the rad vectors per se, alone or in combination
with pps, did not induce intestinal hemorrhages in our mouse
model system. to determine whether a single bolus of  xxxg787xxx 
was sufficient to induce lethal intestinal hemorrhages, two
groups of fvb/n male mice (n ⫽ 5 mice each) were injected
through the retro-orbital venous plexus with either pps alone
(60 mg/kg) or in combination with rh- xxxg787xxx  (5 ␮g/mouse).
this dose of  xxxg787xxx  (200 ␮g/kg per day) is extremely high in
relation to any likely human exposure and resulted in very high
circulating levels of  xxxg787xxx  (156 ⫾ 19 ng/ml; mean ⫾ sd) 5
min after the initial injection. as expected,  xxxg787xxx  was rapidly
cleared from the circulation and could not be detected in the
serum after 24 h. none of the mice injected with pps alone or
pps ⫹  xxxg787xxx  showed evidence of intestinal bleeding or died
after a single bolus injection. two additional groups of male
fvb/n mice (n ⫽ 5 mice per group) were injected via the
peritoneal route with pps (60 mg/kg) alone or in combination
with rh- xxxg787xxx  (5 ␮g/mouse). the peak levels of circulating
rh- xxxg787xxx  were detected ⬃2 h after the initial injection (27 ⫾
2.3 ng/ml; mean ⫾ sd). however, once again, rh- xxxg787xxx  was
rapidly cleared from the circulation and remained undetectable
in the serum 24 h after the initial injection. in a similar manner
to the previous group, none of these mice showed evidence of
intestinal bleeding or died after the single bolus injection of
pps ⫹  xxxg787xxx . thus it appears that high and prolonged steadystate levels of  xxxg787xxx  are required to induce lethal intestinal
bleeding in mice treated with pps.
pps and  xxxg787xxx  induce morphological and capillary permeability changes in intestinal endothelial cells. next, we
hypothesized that pps and  xxxg787xxx , acting in a synergistic
manner, induced morphological changes in intestinal endothelial cells. we found that pps and  xxxg787xxx  induced a significant
dilatation of intestinal submucosal capillaries (fig. 2, f and g,
and fig. 3, b–d), as well as leakage of red blood cells in the
intestinal submucosa (fig. 2, c and d). moreover, the electron
microscopy studies showed that pps and  xxxg787xxx  synergistically
induced ruffling of the endothelial cell membranes and wrin-

angiogenic activity can regulate the activity of heparinoids
and  xxxg787xxx  in a tissue-specific manner (1, 14, 19). for
example, in experimental rat models, low doses of heparin
improved the outcome of colitis and decreased the binding
of  xxxg787xxx  to intestinal cells (14). in contrast, high doses of
heparin induced the opposite effects (14, 15). in our mouse
model, we postulate that pps induces the recruitment of
circulating  xxxg787xxx  in the intestine. thus  xxxg787xxx  accumulates
at a relative higher concentration than does pps, and the
balance between the antiangiogenic versus the proangiogenic activity of pps and  xxxg787xxx , respectively, is shifted
toward the latter, causing significant structural changes in
intestinal endothelial cells. in this case, pps might act like

high doses of heparin, facilitating the recruitment of  xxxg787xxx 
and enhancing its angiogenic activity. both the angiogenic
and anticoagulant activities of pps ⫹  xxxg787xxx  seem to be
required to induce the leakage of red blood cells in the
intestinal submucosa and peritoneal cavity. this process
might be further facilitated by the capacity of anion polysaccharides to inhibit the adhesion of red blood cells to the
endothelium (2). in summary, we propose that the ability of
pps and  xxxg787xxx  to induce intestinal bleeding depends on 1)
the relative concentration of both factors in the intestinal
submucosa; 2) the type of hspg and fgf high-affinity
receptors expressed on intestinal endothelial cells; and 3) the
anticoagulant activity of pps in the intestinal submucosa.

it should be noted, however, that, at the present time, we do
not know the exact basic mechanisms by which both  xxxg787xxx 
and pps induce the development of intestinal bleeding. nevertheless, the light and electron microscopy examination of the
intestinal vessels shows that pps and  xxxg787xxx  induced capillary
and endothelial abnormalities in mice undergoing bleeding
disorders. these alterations include the dilatation of intestinal
submucosal capillaries and ruffling of endothelial cell membranes, as well as the detachment of endothelial cells from the
basement membranes. thus the disruption of the normal structure of intestinal capillaries and endothelial cells acting together with the anticoagulant effect of pps may explain, at
least partially, the leakage of red blood cells. in support of
these findings, experimental evidence implicates  xxxg787xxx  in the
formation of vascular lesions (25).  xxxg787xxx  induces specific
autocrine effects on several endothelial cell types, including
intestinal endothelial cells (21). for example, when  xxxg787xxx  is
injected subcutaneously into nude mice, it causes the appearance of leaky vascular lesions that mimic the early-stage
lesions of kaposi’s sarcoma (4).  xxxg787xxx  is also upregulated and
released by endothelial cells during the proliferation phase of
humans hemangiomas (5, 25). furthermore, mcdonnell et al.
(17) found that overexpression of a secreted fibroblast growth
factor-binding protein enhances the activity of  xxxg787xxx  and
induces lethal vascular hemorrhages in developing chicken
embryos (17). in a similar manner, overexpression of  xxxg786xxx 
(17) or  xxxg787xxx  (25) in chicken embryos also induces significant
vascular leakage and hemorrhages. it is possible that  xxxg787xxx 
may act indirectly by inducing the synthesis or release of other
angiogenic or proteolytic factors (i.e., vegf and  xxxg1428xxx ), which are known to induce structural
changes in endothelial cells and vascular leakage (5, 6, 29). in
any case, further studies are needed to elucidate the basic
mechanism by which  xxxg787xxx  in combination with pps induced
intestinal bleeding.
in summary, we have identified a new disease mechanism of
intestinal bleeding, as well as a new role for  xxxg787xxx  in the
pathogenesis of this disorder. overall, both high and steadystate expression levels of circulating  xxxg787xxx , plus the anticoagulant activity of pps, are needed to induce lethal intestinal
bleeding in mice. it could be argued that the high peak levels
of circulating  xxxg787xxx  detected in our study would not be
achieved in human disease states. nevertheless, patients with
intestinal angiogenic tumors, ulcers, or other inflammatory
intestinal diseases can express, release, and accumulate  xxxg787xxx 
in the intestine, even in the presence of much lower levels of
circulating  xxxg787xxx  (5). in addition, children affected with the
hemolytic uremic syndrome show high levels of circulating
 xxxg787xxx  (23, 24) and are at high risk of intestinal bleeding. thus
these findings might have wider clinical implications for patients treated systemically with pps and other heparinoids for
angiogenic tumors, ulcers, and intestinal inflammatory-angiogenic disorders (5, 16, 30, 34). in contrast, patients treated
orally with pps for cystitis are not likely to be at higher risk of
bleeding, since  xxxg787xxx  is not accumulated in the bladder, and
pss given orally should not induce anticoagulant changes in
the bladder. we speculate that the plasma levels of  xxxg787xxx 
might be a useful tool to identify patients at high risk of
intestinal bleeding when treated with systemic infusions of
pps.
