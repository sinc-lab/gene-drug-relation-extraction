promoter polymorphisms regulating  xxxd1752xxx −
releasing hormone transcription in vitro

to investigate whether polymorphisms in the  xxxd1752xxx −re−
leasing hormone (crh) promoter are associated with altered
crh gene regulation, we studied the reactivity of three recently
described promoter variants in vitro. the 3625 bp variants a1b1,
a2b1 and a2b2 of the human crh promoter were cloned in the
5’ region to a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected
into both mouse anterior pituitary cells att−20d16vf2 and pheo−
chromocytoma cells pc12. incubation with 8−br−camp alone or
in combination with cytokines significantly enhanced the pro−
moter activity in both cell lines studied by up to 22−fold. how−
ever, dexamethasone antagonised camp effects on crh expres−
sion in att−20 cells while showing no effect on pc12 cells, indi−
cating that tissue−specific factors play a crucial role. among the

haplotypes studied, a1b1 exhibited the greatest reactivity on
various stimuli. electric mobility shift assay (emsa) was per−
formed to study whether the described polymorphic nucleotide
sequences in the 5’ region of the hcrh gene interfere with bind−
ing of nuclear proteins. a specific dna protein complex was de−
tected at position −2353 bp for the wild type sequence only, pos−
sibly interfering with a binding site for the activating transcrip−
tion factor 6 (atf6). taken together, this is the first study to de−
monstrate that crh promoter reactivity varies between the com−
pound promoter alleles.

introduction
 xxxd1752xxx −releasing hormone (crh or  xxxd1752xxx −re−
leasing factor) is a 41−amino acid hypothalamic neuropeptide
synthesized in the parvocellular subdivision of the paraventricu−
lar hypothalamic nucleus (pvn). crh is also expressed in other
areas of the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, in−
cluding adrenal medulla, lymphocytes, pancreas, skin, gonads,
uterus, and placenta [1 ± 7]. the human crh gene and its regula−
tory region has been sequenced and finally localised to chromo−
some 8q13, identifying two exons and one intron [8 ± 10]. the

peptide and particular the promoter sequences are highly con−
served in the human, rat and mouse gene [11,12]. however, four
polymorphisms in the human 3.7 kb regulatory region of crh
have been characterized as a t fi c base substitution located at
position −2353 and at position −684 bp, a c fi g base substitution
at position −3531 and a t fi g base substitution located at posi−
tion −3371 bp [13,14]. three of these polymorphisms co−segre−
gate absolutely resulting in two alleles, a1 and a2. compound al−
leles named a1b1, a2b1 and a2b2, respectively, could be as−
signed by taking into account the biallelic polymorphism at posi−
tion −3371 bp in the crh promoter. in the caucasian population,
a1b1 is the most common haplotype, with the other two being

rarely combined alleles. so far, no functional differences have
been attributed to the polymorphisms described. crh is the
principal hypothalamic stimulus to the pituitary−adrenal axis
mediating the interaction of stress events and inflammatory sig−
 xxxd3215xxx  [15]. release of crh initiates a cascade of events, finally
leading to the secretion of cortisol from the adrenal gland and ac−
tivation of the sympathoadrenal axis by increasing catechol−
amine levels [16,17].

cell culture
the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma pc12 cells were obtained
from the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures
(acc 159, braunschweig; germany). pc12 cells were cultured on
either flat bottom wells in 6−well plates of 10 cm2 surface area/
well (tpp schubert, germany) or on flasks of 75 cm2 surface
area, at an initial concentration of 2  105 cells/ml. pc12 cells
were maintained in rpmi 1640 medium containing glutamax
supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated foetal calf serum (fcs),
5 % horse serum (gibco, invitrogen corporation, paisley, scotland,
uk) and antibiotics (100 u/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml strepto−
mycin; sigma, st louis, mo, usa) in a humidified atmosphere at
5 % co2 and 37 8c. the mouse pituitary corticotroph cell line att−
20/d16v−f2 (att−20) was obtained from american type culture
collection (crl−1795, atcc, rockville, md, usa). these cells
were grown under standard culture conditions in dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (dmem) supplemented with 10 % fcs,
2 mm l−glutamine and antibiotics. cells were plated at a density
of approximately 2  106 cells per 75 cm2 tissue culture flask and
maintained in a humidified 5 % co2 atmosphere at 37 8c.
preparation of crh promoter−driven luciferase reporter
construct phcrh3625luc by two−step cloning
to examine the potentially altered regulation of the human crh
gene, we cloned the 3 polymorphic nucleotide fragments pre−
viously sequenced and described as 2 biallelic polymorphic se−
quences resulting in compound alleles a1b1, a2b1, and a2b2,
respectively [18], of the proximal 3625 nucleotides 5’−flanking
region on the major mrna start site of the human corticotro−
phin−releasing hormone gene (hcrh) [19] in a sense orientation
upstream of luc+ into the promoterless luciferase reporter plas−
mid  xxxg2041xxx −basic (fig. 1). the respective long−range 3625 bp pcr
product was previously subcloned into the ta cloning vector,

crh plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes kpni and xhoi. the

pcr2.1 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). this pcr2.1−crh plasmid
was digested with restriction enzymes kpni and xhoi (roche di−
agnostics gmbh, mannheim, germany). to identify the crh pro−
moter construct (~3.7 kb), the pcr2.1 vector (3.9 kb) was addi−
tionally digested with pvui (roche diagnostics). the resulting
right−hand fragment (~3.7 kb) was purified after agarose gel
electrophoresis using a dna extraction kit (invitek, berlin, ger−
many) and ligated at a ratio of 3 : 1 (insert to vector) to similarly
digested and purified  xxxg2041xxx −basic vector dephosphorylated by
shrimp alkaline phosphatase (sap, roche diagnostics). the luci−
ferase construct (8.5 kb) was used to transform e. coli jm109−
competent cells (promega corporation). transformants were
grown overnight in a small volume of lb medium (becton dick−
inson) with ampicillin (sigma, st louis, mo, usa); miniprep dna
(qiagen, hilden, germany) was fractionated on agarose gel to
screen for phcrh3625luc incorporation. the identity of the candi−
date clone was further verified by digestion; the integrity of all
reporter constructs was confirmed by dna sequencing using
dna sequencing kit, big dyetm terminator cycle sequencing
(applied biosystems, warrington, united kingdom). we trans−
fected cells with these constructs and examined the response of
luciferase activity to potential stimulants and inhibitors.
transfection and reporter gene assay
each treatment was performed in duplicate, and each experi−
ment was repeated six times.
one day before transfection, the pc12 cells were plated in normal
growth medium without antibiotics at an initial density of
4  105 cells/well in six−well plates coated with poly−l−lysine
(sigma) resulting in 50 ± 70 % confluent cells at the time of trans−
fection. in case of att−20, cells were plated two days before
transfection at an initial density of 3.5  105 cells/well in six−
well plates. the medium was replaced with fresh medium with−
out antibiotics for the subsequent transfection experiments.
transient transfection was performed with lipofectamin 2000
(invitrogentm, life technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using opti−mem i reduced serum medium to dilute
lipofectamin 2000. pilot experiments were performed for trans−
fection efficiency by transfecting plated pc12 as well as att−20
cells with 3 g egfp−c1 vector (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa). ex−

emsa was performed using nuclear extracts of untreated/treated
pc12 cells to detect nuclear protein dna complexes for determi−
nation of whether the polymorphic nucleotide sequences de−
scribed in the 5’ region of the hcrh gene interfere with binding
of nuclear proteins. to investigate further whether the detected
polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the crh gene may re−
sult in different promoter reactivity upon various stimuli, we
transiently transfected both pheochromocytoma rat pc12 and
mouse corticotroph tumour att−20d16vf2 cells with a 3625 bp
human crh 5’−promoter−luciferase fusion gene and studied the
effects of il−1b, il−6, tnf−a and ifn−g, either alone or combined
with 8−br−camp (camp) on crh gene 5’−promoter activity. fur−
thermore, we studied the crh promoter activity in response to
glucocorticoids using dexamethasone.

preparation of nuclear extracts
pc12 cells grown on six well polystyrene plates were treated
with media−containing reagents. cytokine mixture, 8−br−camp
and dex were added to cell culture alone or in combination as
described above. nuclear extracts were prepared by the proce−
dure as described by andrews and faller [20]. their protein con−
centrations were determined using a bca protein assay kit
(pierce, rockford, il, usa) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the
standard. the nuclear extracts were stored at −80 8c in aliquots
until further use.

equal amounts (5 g) of nuclear extracts were incubated in 10 l

10 min at room temperature (rt) for emsa. nuclear extracts
were incubated with 20−fold molar excess of the cold (unlabell−

rt in the binding buffer prior to addition of the labelled oligo in
the competition experiments. the mixtures were then incubated
with 1 l of 32p labelled probe for 20 min at room temperature
before being applied to 5 % non−denaturing polyacrylamide gels
that were run at 150 v in 0.5 tris borate/ edta buffer at 4 8c for
2.5 h. the gels were dried, autoradiographed and visualized
using a phosphor imaging system.
statistical analyses
values in tables and figures are presented as the mean  sem un−
less otherwise indicated from at least six independent experi−
ments. data were compared by the repeated measures analysis
of variance (anova) followed by bonferroni’s t−test using the
sigmastat software package (spss, inc., chicago, il). when the
normality test failed, we used kruskal−wallis repeated−measures
anova on ranks and dunnett’s method for calculation of multi−
ple comparisons vs. the control group. differences between
groups were calculated using one−way anova followed by the
pair−wise multiple−comparison tukey test and multiple compar−
ison vs. the control group (dunn’s method). the difference be−
tween experimental conditions was considered significant at
values of p < 0.05.

results
role of polymorphisms in the regulatory region of crh gene
on functional crh promoter activity
we first examined whether the 3625 bp region of the crh pro−
moter fused to a luciferase reporter gene (phcrh3625luc con−
struct) was sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in pitui−
tary (att−20/d16v−f2) and pheochromocytoma (pc12) cell lines.
low level of basal promoter activity in combination with 50 %
transfection efficiency in pc12 and att−20 cells yielded very low
levels of uninduced luciferase activity in these transient trans−
fection assays. the promoterless parent vector  xxxg2041xxx −basic

a total of 3 g of dna (ratio phcrh3625luc firefly: prl−null re−
nilla as cotransfected vector 30 : 1) and 10 l of lipofectamin
2000 per transfection/well were used in the luciferase activity
assay. in each experiment, the  xxxg2041xxx −basic plasmid was also
transfected in separate wells in order to determine the basic ac−
tivity of the promoterless plasmid. cells were incubated with the
transfection mixture for 6 h. transfectants were then switched to
the initial serum−containing medium with antibiotics and left
overnight in culture before cells were washed and exposed for
36 h to the compounds described and their combinations:
5  10 ± 7m dexamethasone (sigma, steinheim, germany); 5 mm
8−br−camp; a cytokine mixture including recombinant il−1b
40 ng/ml, il−6 20 ng/ml,  xxxg1141xxx  10 u/ml (r&d systems, minneapo−
lis, mn, usa),  xxxg2296xxx  10 ng/ml (sigma). cells were washed twice
with pbs and lysed in 500 l passive lysis buffer (promega cor−
poration) for 20 min at room temperature. activities of the firefly
luciferase and the renilla luciferase in cell lysates were meas−
ured sequentially by using the dual−luciferase reporter assay
(drl) system (promega corporation, madison, wi, usa) accord−
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. the light output from the
firefly luciferase or the renilla luciferase was recorded for 15 s
following a 3 s pre−measurement delay using a td−20/20  xxxd2637xxx −
ometer (turner designs, sunnyvale, ca, usa). the luciferase ac−
tivity closely reflects changes in promoter activity, thus the re−
porter protein activity indicates changes in the transcription
rate. initial experiments revealed that renilla luciferase activity
in cell lysate was not affected by glucocorticoids, camp or the
above noted cytokine mixture. the variation in transfection effi−
ciency was normalized by dividing the firefly luciferase activity
with the renilla luciferase activity. the transcriptional activity
of the promoter−reporter construct was determined as relative
fluorescence units to that of the untreated transfectants.

incubation with 5 mm 8−bromo−camp (8−br−camp) for 36 h

tion increase of 13.1  3.1 times unstimulated controls (p < 0.05,

the studies revealed an increase in promoter activity of 6.0  1.3
and 8.1  2.0 times control values, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.05;
fig. 2). there was a statistically significant difference in 8−br−
camp−induced stimulatory effect between a1b1 and a2b1
(p < 0.05). generally, att−20 cells showed a higher responsive−
ness to camp treatment (5 mm, 36 h). compared to unstimulated
controls, a1b1 and a2b1 haplotypes showed a significant 18.8
and 18.5−fold induction in luciferase activity, respectively
(p < 0.05, n = 6). in contrast, only a 10.5−fold increase in promoter
activity was obtained for a2b2 (n = 6, p < 0.05, table 1). a1b1
showed a significantly more pronounced modulation of lucifer−
ase activity compared to a2b2 (p < 0.05).
effects of cytokines (il−1b, il−6,  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg1141xxx )
initial experiments revealed no significant effects of the respec−
tive cytokine alone on luciferase activities in either cell line (data
not shown). hence, the combination of cytokines il−1b, il−6, tnf−
a, and ifn−g exhibited a slight increase (3−fold) in luciferase ac−
tivity in all three haplotypes studied (p < 0.05) over unstimulated
controls with transfected pc12 cells. there was no statistically
significant difference in induced promoter activity between the
a1b1, a2b1 and a2b2 haplotypes (fig. 2). in contrast, incubating
att−20 cells with il−1, il−6, tnf−a and ifn−g for 36 h had no ob−
servable effect on crh promoter activity (data not shown).

expression. this effect may be attributed to differential binding
characteristics of various transcription factors, in particular at
position −2353 bp of the crh promoter. secondly, pc12 and att−
20 cells differ in their capacity to mediate signals to the crh pro−
moter. thirdly, a1b1 is the most sensible haplotype for modulat−
ing gene expression in both cell lines studied.

in this report, we have investigated whether genetic variation at
the  xxxd1752xxx −releasing hormone (crh) locus has any func−
tional consequence on the crh promoter activity in response to
various stimuli. we studied the effects of cytokines, camp and
the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, respectively, on
crh gene expression using pc12 rat pheochromocytoma and
att−20 mouse corticotroph cells transiently transfected with the
crh 5’−promoter luciferase reporter gene construct. further−
more, an emsa was performed to investigate the influence of
the promoter polymorphisms on nuclear protein−binding inten−
sity. the following major points emerged from the present inves−
tigation: firstly, the combined haplotypes of the crh promoter
named a1b1, a2b1, and a2b2 modulate differentially crh gene

the camp pathway mediates major stimulation of crh gene ex−
pression. like other investigators [21 ± 25], we could demon−
strate that camp increase gene expression in reporter constructs
with the 5’ regulatory region of crh fused to luciferase (luc) in
transient transfection assays using rat pc12 and mouse att−20
cell lines. even though these are animal cell lines, they are best
studied in the context of human crh gene regulation via transi−
ent transfection. furthermore, regulation of crh gene expression
in these cell lines resembles regulation in the human hypothala−
mus [26]. however, since the crh gene is regulated differentially
in various tissues, the results cannot be interpolated to crh gene
regulation in other tissues such as the placenta [27]. in our study,
the stimulatory effect of camp on crh gene expression was gen−

cytokines on crh promoter activity in pc12 cells (fig. 2). the ad−

ferase activity in all haplotypes studied (a1b1, 67.9 %; a2b1,
22.3 %; a2b2, 58.1 %; p < 0.05). however, there was no significant
difference between the groups in detectable promoter activity
after dex treatment. cytokine−induced luciferase activity in
pc12 cells was slightly modulated by dex (fig. 2). an inhibitory
effect of dex was obtained for the a2b1 haplotype (46 %; n = 6).
in both a1b1 and a2b2, luciferase assay showed that dex treat−
ment had a mild inhibitory effect on promoter activity (14 % de−
crease after 36 h, non−significant).

activity in pc12 cells co−incubated with cytokines or
cytokines plus 8−br−camp
low levels of basal crh promoter activity yielded very low levels
of uninduced luc activity in these transient transfection assays,
preventing the study of dexamethasone regulation of basal crh
luc activity (data not shown). in att−20 cells, dexamethasone
showed significant effects on crh gene expression. it decreased
camp−stimulated luciferase activity in a1b1, a2b1 and a2b2 by
67.3 %, 38.9 % and 55.7 %, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.05; table 1), in−
dicating that the a1b1 haplotype is more sensitive to dex and
camp incubation. there was a statistically significant difference
in resulting luciferase activities between the a1b1 and a2b1
haplotypes (p < 0.05; table 1).

we could demonstrate that camp−dependent transcriptional ac−
tivation is mediated largely through a classical, highly conserved
consensus sequence ± a camp responsive element (cre) within
the proximal crh promoter [12, 28]. interestingly, further re−
sponse elements could be identified as being involved in camp
signalling ± a responsive region distinct from the cre, a caudal−
type homeobox response element (cdxre), and various tran−
scription factors either interacting with a heterologous promoter
or specifically with cre [29 ± 31]. additional elements were re−
cently described for cell type−specific camp dependant enhance−
ment of gene transcription, in particular nuclear factor y (nf−y)
[32]. nf−y together with other nuclear proteins exhibits enor−
mous potential to affect transcription. interestingly, the poly−
morphism at position −684 is located at a consensus sequence
for a nf−y box−binding factor (−687 to −673) that might be
responsible for the differences we observed for the camp−in−
duced luc activity. we found a variation in binding intensity
due to incubation conditions in the emsa, with camp being the
most potent inducer of nuclear protein binding indicating the
importance of this region for crh gene regulation. however, we
could not detect any difference in the emsa between the wt and
mt sequence at position −684.
importantly, the polymorphism at position −2353 results in a
base exchange for the binding site of the transcription factor ac−
tivating transcription factor 6 (atf6). atf6 is a member of the
human basic leucine zipper (bzip) protein family and partici−
pates in two independent signalling pathways, both of which
lead to transcriptional activation in the nucleus and interact
with camp responsiveness [33, 34]. interestingly, emsa of pc12
cell nuclear extracts demonstrated different protein−dna inter−
actions between the wt and mt sequence at position −2353.
treating pc12 with cytokines or camp led to a specific binding
of nuclear protein for wt sequence (a1) only. hence, the observed
differences in the response of crh promoter activity might be
mediated by this motif.
in addition to camp, inflammatory cytokines can cause stimula−
tion of the hpa axis via direct and indirect mechanisms [35] act−
ing through regulation of nuclear factor (nf)−kb and the mito−
gen−activated protein (map) kinase pathways [36]. interestingly,
cytokines could be shown to stimulate the crh promoter via in−
teractions with the creb/cre system [37] revealing an avenue
for crosstalk between both signalling systems. in this respect,
our results underline the modulating capacity of cytokines on
camp induced luc activity in pc12 cells. however, this poten−
tiating effect could not be observed in att20 cells indicating a
cell or tissue−specific effect, possibly due to the intracellular sig−
nalling machinery utilised by the stimuli. interestingly, the poly−
morphism at position −3371 of the crh promoter is located
within a stat (signal transducers and activators of transcription)
motif [38] and a site for the myocyte−specific enhancer factor 2
(mef2) transcription factor [39]. however, we could not detect
a significant difference for cytokine−induced luc activity be−
tween the haplotypes studied. taken together, all studies point
to complex mechanisms involved in the actions of cytokines on

crh gene regulation, with modulation of the camp−induced
crh response as a major pathway.
our observation from att−20 cells that dexamethasone produced
a 2 to 3−fold repression of camp−stimulated crh promoter activ−
ity is consistent with the findings of other groups [40, 41]. we
found that the a1b1 haplotype exhibited the most pronounced
repression of crh promoter activity, followed by a2b2 and
a2b1. the molecular basis of the glucocorticoid effect on crh
promoter is somewhat obscure since no classical consensus glu−
cocorticoid response element (gre) sequences have been identi−
fied within the 5’−flanking region. however, the crh promoter
contains a half gre site at −598 bp [10], and a variety of potential
regulatory elements have been localized to the 5’−regulatory re−
gion [42]. in stably as well as transiently transfected cells, dexa−
methasone decreased  xxxd1742xxx −stimulated crh mrna [21] act−
ing via direct or indirect interactions between the glucocorticoid
receptor and creb [40]. taken together, these studies demon−
strate that glucocorticoids inhibit crh promoter activities in
transfected att−20 cells despite the absence of a consensus gre.
in this respect, the significant differences between the crh pro−
moter haplotypes for dexamethasone−mediated suppression of
luc activity we observed may be attributed to the varying re−
sponsiveness on camp stimulation as described above. thus,
the polymorphic promoter sequences we studied may play a
role in fine−tuning the response of the crh gene expression to
various stimuli together with potential additional factors [43].
in conclusion, we could demonstrate that crh promoter activity
is differentially regulated in transiently transfected att−20 and
pc12 cells. while pc12 cells responded better to cytokine stimu−
lation, att−20 cells were more susceptible to dexamethasone
modulation of crh reporter activity. finally, the promoter haplo−
types studied exhibited a differential capacity to modulate crh
gene expression, which was probably due to differential binding
of nuclear factors resulting in altered camp signalling. in all our
experiments and cell lines studied, the a1b1 haplotype showed
the most pronounced influence on promoter activity probably
mediated by differential binding of the atf6 transcription factor
at position −2353. studies are underway to evaluate the clinical
significance of these findings in various disease states.
