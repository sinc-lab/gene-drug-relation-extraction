abstract
objectives the aim of this work was to study the effect of surface tension and contact
angle on the permeation of haloperidol across human skin using cyclodextrin derivatives.
methods surface tension and contact angle of randomly methylated b-cyclodextrin
(rm b-cd) and hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin (hp b-cd) solutions were measured.
haloperidol solubility and molecular modelling were carried out using the two cyclodextrin
derivatives. in-vitro skin permeation was carried out using human skin models.
key findings the highest increase in drug solubility was observed when the drug was in
solution with ph 5 when compared to non-ionised solution, resulting in a 128-fold increase
in the intrinsic solubility of the drug. surface tension measurements indicate a surfaceactive effect for rm b-cd and hp b-cd. contact angle measurements showed that
vehicles with higher skin wettability increased the contact of the drug with the skin surface
and therefore resulted in higher drug permeation across human epidermis.
conclusions it is concluded that transdermal flux of a drug through the skin may be
optimised by controlling surface tension, drug solubility and skin wettability.

the stratum corneum presents a barrier to transdermal delivery of molecules, leading to
sub-therapeutic drug effect. chemical enhancers have therefore been used to increase the
permeation of drug molecules. according to fick’s law of diffusion, the delivery rate of
molecules is dependent on their physicochemical properties, partitioning coefficients and
solubilities. diffusion of a drug across the skin is a function of its solubility. enhancers can
modify drug solubility in the vehicle by means of increasing drug thermodynamic activity
or drug concentration in the donor phase to help increase drug penetration across the
skin.[1,2]
haloperidol is a neuroleptic drug for schizophrenia, mania and similar psychotic states.
this drug is practically insoluble in water and has a basic pk of 8.3. haloperidol is a
hydrophobic molecule (log p = 3.49) with a low molecular weight of 375.9 da, making it
a suitable candidate for transdermal application.[3,4]
current approaches to solubilise water-insoluble drugs are complex formation with
cyclodextrins, liposomes, microemulsion-based drug-delivery systems and supersaturation.
cyclodextrins (cds) are attractive candidates for increasing the aqueous solubilities of
lipophilic drugs. they are cyclic oligosaccharides of d-glucopyranose units in the shape of
cones, each with an outer hydrophilic surface and an inner hydrophobic cavity. the
solubilisation effect of cds is due to the formation of a non-covalent water-soluble
inclusion complex, which makes drug–cd complexes easily dissociated and in equilibrium
with free drug.[4,5]
due to the solubility, hygroscopicity and toxicity concerns regarding cds, they have in
general been modified and examples are hydroxypropyl b-cds (hp b-cds) and randomly
methylated b-cd (rm b-cds).[5–7] cd derivatives can influence the solubilities of
drugs.[4,5,8] they can decrease local irritation at the site of application[9–11] as well as

in-vitro permeation of haloperidol with cyclodextrin

stabilise photosensitive drugs.[12] some investigators have
reported that cds increase the skin permeation rates of drugs
by extracting the lipid from the skin,[13–16] while others have
reported that cds do not show any enhancing effect on the
flux rates of drugs through the skin.[17–19]
the ph of the vehicle influences the solubility and
partitioning of the drug into the skin, implying that the ionised
and unionised moieties of a drug influence its solubility and
partitioning through the stratum corneum and hence affect the
flux of drugs.[20–22] wagner’s group reported that ph values of
donor and receptor compartments influence skin ph and change
the skin permeability of the drug.[23] on the other hand,
sznitowska’s team reported that there were no significant
differences in the permeability of hydrocortisone in the ph
range of 1–10 and only extreme ph values affected drug
permeation across the skin.[24]
drug absorption is directly related to the drug partition
between the vehicle and the skin surface. adhesion and
wettability of the formulation to the skin surface are critical
factors in therapeutic efficacy and can be determined from
contact angle measurements. this defines the process used to
counter the surface tension between drug vehicle and the
skin surface to allow complete contact over the entire
delivery surface.[25–28] the surface tension of human skin is
27–28 dyne/cm, and transdermal formulations with surface
tension value equal to or less that this amount can therefore
adhere to the skin surface. reducing interfacial tension
between the topical drug delivery system and the skin
improves the contact between the drug and skin surface and
facilitates drug transfer across the skin.[29–31]
the aim of the present work was to investigate the
solubility and skin permeation of haloperidol from cd
solutions. for this purpose the complexation of haloperidol
with two derivatives of b-cd (rm b-cd and hp b-cd) was
studied by the phase solubility method. molecular modelling
was conducted using dimethyl-b-cyclodextrin (dm b-cd)
and hp b-cd. surface tension and contact angle measurements were carried out to further elucidate the effect of cds
on the permeability of haloperidol though human epidermis.
the effect of concentrations of rm b-cd alone and then
combined with limonene on the skin permeation were
studied. to elucidate the influence of ph of the donor
phase on skin permeability, further experiments using
phosphate buffer at ph 5 in the donor compartment, alone
and also in combination with rm b-cd, were carried out.
then, rm b-cd was added to the receptor solution to
maintain a sink condition, while the donor compartment
consisted of solutions of haloperidol in rm b-cd or
 xxxd3034xxx .

materials and methods
materials
haloperidol,  xxxd1945xxx , limonene and  xxxd3034xxx 
were purchased from sigma, singapore. 2-hydroxypropylb-cyclodextrin (hp b-cd) (degree of substitution of about
0.6) and rm b-cd (degree of substitution of about 1.8)
were kind gifts from roquette (lestrem, france) and
wacker (burghausen, germany), respectively. hplc grade

acetonitrile was obtained from tedia (usa). milli-q water
(18 momega·cm at 25°c), generated from a millipore direct-q
ultra-pure water system (billerica, usa), was used to
prepare the buffer solutions and other aqueous solutions.

hplc analysis
haloperidol concentration was quantified by hplc using a
shimadzu (kyoto, japan) 2010a. the analysis was carried
out using a reversed-phase waters symmetry shield column
(3.5 mum, 3.0 mm  100 mm). the mobile phase was a 55:45
volume ratio of acetonitrile and 0.05 m phosphate buffer
adjusted to ph 3 using phosphoric acid, flowing at a rate of
0.4 ml/min. uv detection at wavelength 254 nm, injection
volume 100 mul gave a retention time of 3.5 and 5 min for the
internal standard ( xxxd1945xxx ) and haloperidol, respectively.
standard solutions of haloperidol (0.05–2 mug/ml) and
 xxxd1945xxx  (0.2 mug/ml) were prepared in 0.03% v/v lactic
acid.[3]
phase solubility studies
drug–cd inclusion complexes were prepared by adding an
excess concentration of haloperidol (15 mg/ml), dissolved in
water or buffer phosphate (ph 5), using rm b-cd and hp
b-cd solutions of different concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1,
0.2, 0.3 m). the suspensions were shaken on a horizontal
rotary shaker in the absence of light for 7 days and finally
filtered through a membrane filter (millipore filters, 0.45 mum
pore size, 25 mm diameter) to obtain clear solutions. all
samples were prepared in triplicate. the concentrations of
haloperidol in the inclusion complexes were determined by
hplc assay.
molecular modelling
molecular modelling was carried out to elaborate the
complexation modes. dm b-cd was adopted as a substitute
for rm b-cd (degree of substitution = 1.8) to facilitate the
determination of the stable structure of the haloperidol–rm
b-cd complex because rm b-cd is a mixture of different
structures. hp b-cd with a degree of substitution of 0.6 was
used for the experimental study; four 2-hydroxypropyl
groups were added on the primary hydroxyl groups of
b-cyclodextrin.[32] the structures of haloperidol, dm b-cd
and hp b-cd were individually minimised by mmff94s
force field using sybyl software, version 7.2 (tripos co.,
usa). after thorough minimisation, docking experiments
were carried out on all molecules using the ‘dock’ module in
sybyl. this allowed the haloperidol to move within the
energy field of the dm b-cd or hp b-cd in order to find its
preferred binding geometries. the haloperidol molecule in its
favourable conformation was introduced into the respective
dm b-cd and hp b-cd cavities and the interaction energies
were computed. the most likely conformation of each
complex was the one with the lowest interaction energy.
measurements of surface tension
and contact angle
surface tensions of solutions were measured by the du nouy
ring method at room temperature (20 ± 2°c) using a digital
tensiometer (sigma 700 ksv instruments, helsinki, finland).

the precision of the force transducer of the tensiometer was
0.01 mn/m. a du nouy ring with a platinum–iridium ring
having a mean diameter of 9.545 mm was employed.
following each measurement, the ring was washed with
milli-q water and subjected to a high temperature flame to
ensure complete removal of residues. maximum surface
tension values of each concentration and a total of three surface
tension measurements for each solution were obtained. the
surface tensions of rm b-cd and hp b-cd were measured
using 17 different concentrations. the surface tension of each
formulation used in the permeation study was also measured
using the same method.
the wettability of the excised human skin sample was
determined by sessile drop contact angle using a rame-hart
100 goniometer (usa). for contact angle measurements,
excised human skin was employed. skin samples were
prepared as those for the permeation studies; this was done
because of its potential for elucidation of the mechanism of
drug permeation studies.

preparation of human epidermis
skin samples of adult females were obtained, with patient
consent and ethics approval, after abdominal reduction
surgery. this study was approved by the institutional review
board (irb) of singapore general hospital, republic of
singapore (irb reference number 196/2006). this irb
operates in accordance with the international conference on
harmonization/singapore guideline for good clinical practices, and with the applicable regulatory requirements.
subcutaneous fat was carefully separated from the stratum
corneum and epidermis after immersing the whole skin in
60 ± 5°c distilled water for 2 min. samples were stored at
-80°c until use. prior to the permeation studies the skin
samples, stratum corneum side facing upwards, were
equilibrated in 0.9% w/w  xxxd3213xxx  solutions containing 1% v/v antibacterial antimycotic solution.[33]
in-vitro skin permeation studies
permeation studies of the drug, alone or as complexes with
rm b-cd, were performed using a flow-through diffusion
cell apparatus. a flow-through diffusion cell, used for the
measurement of permeability of small tissue samples, is a
modified franz diffusion cell equipped with an automated
flow-through system with high solvent-flow rate and a large
donor compartment.[34]
the donor compartment was filled with 1 ml of
formulations containing 2 mg/ml of the drug. the first
receptor phase was isotonic phosphate buffer saline 0.02 m
(ph 7.4), and then the receptor phase was changed to 0.1% w/v
of rm b-cd for the second series of studies. the exposed
surface area of the skin for the permeation of the drug was
0.785 cm2. samples from the receptor phase were collected
every 6 h over a 30-h period, and the amount of haloperidol
permeated was analysed by hplc. the cell temperature
was kept at 37 ± 0.5°c throughout the experiment. the
steady state flux (j) was estimated from the slope of the
straight line portion of the profile of cumulative haloperidol
absorbed against time. experiments were carried out in
triplicate.

the effect of rm b-cd on the skin permeation of
haloperidol was studied using two sets of experiments. first a
concentration-dependent effect of rm b-cd (0, 0.01, 0.05,
0.1 m) in the donor compartment was studied, with 0.02 m
phosphate buffer saline (pbs) at ph 7.4 as receptor solution.
a synergistic effect of rm b-cd in combination with
limonene 0.1% v/v in  xxxd3034xxx  (pg) solution was
also investigated. the ph-effect on the permeability of the
drug was studied at ph 5. the buffer solution was prepared
by using 0.05 m sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate
with the final ph adjusted by adding potassium hydrogen
orthophosphate 3-hydrate. the combined effect of ph and
0.01 m rm b-cd was also observed. in another set of
experiments, pbs in the receiver solution was replaced by
0.01% w/v rm b-cd, while the donor compartment
consisted of haloperidol in 0.01 m rm b-cd or pg solutions.

statistics
the values are expressed as mean ± sd (n = 3). comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance,
anova (graph pad prism, version 2), followed by the
tukey’s post-test to determine the differences between
treatment groups. the differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

results and discussion
solubility
the solubilities of haloperidol in aqueous phosphate buffer
solutions at ph 5, with and without rm b-cd or hp b-cd,
are presented in figure 1. this ph was selected as it is the
same ph as the skin and may therefore minimise skin
irritation. the highest increase in drug solubility occurred for
rm b-cd, indicating that this oligosaccharide complexed
more of the drug than hp b-cd. the solubilisation profile in
figure 1 is linear for all formulations, indicating the
formation of a 1:1 complex irrespective of the ionisation of
the drug. drug solubility was assessed in two different
solutions (aqueous solution and aqueous solutions with ph
adjusted to ph 5). in solutions of ph 5, the drug is ionised
and therefore more soluble when compared to the aqueous
solution, resulting in a 128-fold increase of the intrinsic
solubility of the drug. when phase-solubility experiments
were performed with cd in the presence of buffer, the
change in solubility was higher than in the presence of cd
alone, indicating a synergistic effect. it is evident that the
methylated cds increased the solubility of haloperidol due to
their strongly surface-active behaviour. methylated cds
have been observed to have larger cavity volumes than hp
b-cd. consequently, rm b-cd can easily accommodate
hydrophobic drugs such as haloperidol.[35]
molecular modelling
the hypothetical structures of the complexes formed by
haloperidol and the various cyclodextrins are presented in
figure 2. for the haloperidol–dm b-cd complex, the
computed total energy is –40.7 kcal/mol and the steric
energy is -30.587 kcal/mol. for the haloperidol–hp b-cd
complex, total energy is -39.6 kcal/mol and the steric energy

is -29.848 kcal/mol. the difference in energy values
indicates that the interaction between haloperidol and dm
b-cd might be stronger than that of haloperidol and hp
b-cd. the molecular modelling that was conducted to
support the solubility study showed that the low solubility of
haloperidol from the hp b-cd–haloperidol complex is due to
the weak binding between haloperidol and hp b-cd whereas
the strong interaction between haloperidol and rm b-cd
resulted in relatively higher haloperidol solubility.

surface tension and contact angle
the surface tensions of aqueous solutions of different
concentrations (m) of rm b-cd and hp b-cd are shown in
figure 3. a remarkable change in the surface tension of pure
water occurred when rm b-cd or hp b-cd was added,
indicating that these systems have an effect on the surface
tension of pure water. the aqueous solution of b-cd does not
have any surface activity, but substitution of native cds
reduces the surface activity of the molecule.[36–39] from
figure 3 it is evident that surface tension reached a constant
value after a certain concentration, suggesting the formation of
supermolecular aggregates of rm b-cd and hp b-cd.[38,40]
critical micelle concentration (cmc) values were determined
from the sharp changes in the slope of the surface tension
versus log [cd] plot. cmc values for rm b-cd and hp b-cd
were 10 mm (figure 3).
based on the above results, a possible mechanism for the
formation of large micelle assemblies was deduced, as shown
in figure 4. particle size analysis, as observed by light
scattering, supported this hypothesis.[40] however, due to the
short length of the hydrophobic chain in the cd structure,
these aggregates may not behave in a similar manner to
conventional surfactants.[38,41]
surface tension and contact angle values of the solutions
used are stated in table 1. it was observed that the surface
tension of water (70.3 ± 0.25 mn/m) decreases with increase
in the concentration of rm b-cd. the interfacial values
of rm b-cd at 0.05 and 0.1 m were of similar values:
54.8 ± 0.31 and 54.1 ± 0.22 mn/m, respectively. however the surface tension of rm b-cd at 0.01 m was
57.5 ± 0.68 mn/m. buffer phosphate solutions had lower
surface tension of 59.2 ± 0.42 mn/m, and an addition of
rm b-cd further decreased the surface tension to
56.5 ± 0.03 mn/m. addition of limonene did not produce
any decrease in interfacial tension (36.2 ± 0.06 mn/m) when

figure 4 schematic aggregation of cyclodextrin

compared to pure  xxxd3034xxx  solutions
(36.2 ± 0.21 mn/m), indicating that limonene does not
possess any surface-active effect. the addition of rm
b-cd to pg solution did not change the interfacial tension,
mainly due to the very low surface tension of pg, which
masks the effect of rm b-cd (see table 1).
from table 1, water had the highest contact angle of
91.6 ± 3.13°, indicating its low wettability on the skin
surface, whereas the contact angle for pg was found to be
40 ± 4.54°, which resulted in higher wettability of the skin
surface. the contact angles for rm b-cd 0.1 m and buffer
ph 5 were 52 ± 3.82° and 54.11 ± 6.58°, respectively. the
contact angles for rm b-cd at 0.05 m and 0.01 m, pg–
limonene, pg–limonene–rm b-cd and buffer ph 5–rm
b-cd were not measured and were thought to be similar to
rm b-cd at 0.1 m, pg and buffer solutions, respectively, as
their interfacial values did not differ much.

permeation studies
rm b-cds were used in permeation studies due to their
significant effect on the solubility of haloperidol compared
with hp b-cds as shown in the solubility results above.
figure 5a shows the effect of different molar ratios of rm
b-cd on the permeation of haloperidol. the cumulative
haloperidol concentration decreased with increasing rm
b-cd concentration. the in-vitro permeation of haloperidol
through human stratum corneum showed a similar trend in
the presence of both rm b-cd at 0.1 m and 0.05 m, with a
low drug penetration through the skin (p > 0.05). this is
not surprising: it could be that due to the supermolecular
arrangement and high concentrations of rm b-cd, the
aggregations produced were too large to increase drug
permeability. however, at lower concentrations of rm
b-cd (0.01 m), an increase in skin permeation flux rate

in-vitro permeation of haloperidol with cyclodextrin

775

when haloperidol was complexed with rm b-cd at 0.01 m in
limonene 0.1% v/v and pg solution. as shown in figure 5b
and table 2, the combination of cd with limonene slightly
increased the percutaneous absorption compared to the
control, but not significantly (p > 0.05). however, the drug
permeation profiles were completely different and the lack of
a significant difference between the flux in limonene and
limonene rm b-cd solution suggests a high enhancing
effect of limonene that masks the effect of rm b-cd.
figure 5c shows the effect of ph on the permeation rate of
haloperidol alone and in combination with rm b-cd. the
flux of the ionised drug at ph 5 and rm b-cd at 0.01 m
concentration was enhanced over that when the buffer was
used alone (p < 0.05, table 2). the higher flux is a result of
increased solubility of the drug. synergistic effects can be
achieved by adjusting the ph and concentration of rm b-cd
to obtain improved solubility and therefore skin permeability
of the drug.[21,22,50] the ph of the stratum corneum is about
4.8–6.[24,51] some authors have reported that the skin
permeability does not change in the ph range of 3.5–
8.5,[24,51] while others have shown that the maximum drug
flux through the skin occurrs at the ph where ionised species
of the drug exist in large amounts.[20] both ionised and
unionised moieties of drug molecules contributed to the total
flux (jtot), which can be calculated using the following
equation:

was observed (p < 0.01). the flux is due to haloperidol
molecules that have not formed complexes with rm b-cd.
an increase in rm b-cd concentration causes a decrease in
dissociated haloperidol molecules, and therefore the amount
of free drug available for permeation decreases.[18,42]
from the phase solubility diagram, it is evident that the
cds are potent solubilisers. however, it is important to use
just enough cd to dissolve the drug; addition of too much
cd will decrease drug partitioning into the skin.[43]
previous studies have reported that cd enhances drug
permeation by extracting lipids from the skin.[13,15,16] also, a
concentration-dependent effect of cyclodextrin on lipid extraction has been reported.[44] however, the opposite trend was
observed in our experiments and also in earlier studies, where
drug permeation decreased with increase in cyclodextrin
concentrations.[45,46] divergent results regarding the role of
cd derivatives as skin penetration enhancers may be due to the
use of different concentrations of these compounds in the
various research papers. the surface-active effect and the cmc
value of these cd derivatives may help explain the various
observations reported in these papers. at concentrations above
the cmc point, formation of cd aggregates could decrease the
rate of skin permeation of drugs.
cd has been used in combination with chemical
enhancers[17,47–49] and electroporation[7] to increase the
skin permeation rate of drugs. previous studies from our
laboratories showed that limonene is a good penetration
enhancer for the delivery of haloperidol.[3] to investigate the
possible use of cd as a co-enhancer, additional tests were
carried out by combining limonene with rm b-cd.

in (a) and (b), receiver solution is phospahate-buffered saline; in (c),
receiver solution is randomly methylated b-cyclodextrin (rm b-cd)
0.01% w/v. pg,  xxxd3034xxx .

ionised and unionised moieties respectively.[20] the results
from the drug solubility profiles showed that the ionised
moieties of the drug have higher solubilities and therefore
greater impact on the total flux of the drug. results from our
study suggest that the simultaneous presence of both rm
b-cd and phosphate buffer ph 5 at suitable concentrations
could be exploited to improve drug solubility and permeability, resulting in enhanced permeation of the drug though
the skin when compared to unionised drug solution.
physiological buffer solutions with ph 7.4 are normally
placed in the receptor compartment of the flow-though cell.
however, for a less water-soluble drug, sink conditions and
therefore total flux may increase with changes in the receptor
phase. our next approach was to study the possible
promoting effect of the cds in receptor solutions. sclafani
and co-workers reported that gamma-cd in receiver solutions
influenced the permeation rate of progesterone.[52] in our
study, rm b-cd (0.1% w/v) was chosen because of its
significant enhancement of the solubility of haloperidol.
figure 5d compares the cumulative drug amount permeated
when rm b-cd 0.01% w/v was placed in the donor solution.
a substantial increase in haloperidol permeability was
obtained by using 0.1% rm b-cd as the receptor solution
and rm b-cd at 0.01 m in the donor compartment (table 2).
critical contact angle value, which distinguishes between
penetration and non-penetration, helped to optimise the drug
permeation rate. from figure 5 and table 1, it can be seen that
a pg solution, with lower contact angle value, results in a
higher drug permeation rate when compared with pure water.
addition of rm b-cd to the vehicle reduced the interfacial
tension of the aqueous system to allow good wetting of drug
on the skin surface and a higher permeability of the drug. all
aqueous formulations showed an improvement in wetting
properties and skin permeability compared with that obtained
using pure water. the lowest values for interfacial tension
were obtained for the formulations containing 0.01 m rm
b-cd at ph 5, which promoted the drug permeation.
before any molecule can penetrate through the skin, it has
first to adhere to the skin surface. the wetting rates and the

viscosities of these formulations therefore influence the
penetration rate of the drug. as a result, the physicochemical
characteristics of the vehicle and other ingredients in a
formulation have a great impact on skin permeation rate.[53,54]

conclusions
the influence of rm b-cd and ph on the permeation of a drug
through isolated human skin was studied. rm b-cd and hp
b-cd significantly increased the aqueous solubility of haloperidol in a linear manner. there was a concentration-dependent
effect on the permeation enhancement and the flux of the drug
decreased with increasing concentration of rm b-cd, therefore
sufficient cd must be added to dissolve the drug. addition of
more cd (above its cmc value) will result in molecular
aggregation and decrease the drug permeation rates. contact
angle measurements showed that vehicles with higher skin
wettability increased the contact of the drug with skin surface
and therefore increased drug permeation rate. absorption of
drug through the skin is affected by the drug partitioning
between the formulation and the skin surface, thus complete
skin contact throughout the application period is thought to be
necessary. drug transfer to the skin will be fast if the
formulation has a high affinity to the skin surface. adjustments
of ph with addition of cd could synergistically enhance drug
permeation.
