abstract: diabetes is associated with an increase risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd). recently, macrovascular complications of diabetes have been shown to start before the development of diabetes. indeed, several clinical studies have confirmed the increased risk of
cvd in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (igt). since postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are thought to play a
central role in the development and progression of cvd in patients with igt, amelioration of postprandial hyperglycemia as well as insulin resistance is a therapeutic target for the prevention of cvd in these high-risk patients. acarbose, an -glucosidase inhibitor, delays
the absorption of carbohydrate from the small intestine, thereby reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. further, recently, acarbose has
been shown to improve insulin resistance in vivo. these findings suggest that acarbose is a promising metabolic modifier that could reduce the risk of cvd in patients with the metabolic syndrome. in this paper, we review the clinical utility of acarbose in various cardiometabolic disorders.

introduction
atherosclerotic arterial disease is manifested clinically as cardiovascular disease (cvd) [1]. diabetes is a major risk factor for
cvd morbidity and mortality, and the incidence of cvd is 2-4
times greater in diabetic patients than in a general population [1].
further, cvd is responsible for about 70 % of all causes of death in
patients with type 2 diabetes [2]. recently, macrovascular complications of diabetes have been shown to start before the development
of diabetes [3,4]. indeed, several clinical studies have confirmed the
increased risk of cvd in patients with impaired glucose tolerance
(igt) [3,4]. since postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are thought to play a central role in the development and progression of cvd in patients with igt [5-7], amelioration of postprandial hyperglycemia as well as insulin resistance is a therapeutic
target for the prevention of cvd in these high-risk patients.
acarbose, an -glucosidase inhibitor, delays the absorption of
carbohydrate from the small intestine, thereby reducing postprandial hyperglycemia [8]. further, recently, acarbose has been
shown to improve insulin resistance in humans [9-11]. these findings suggest that acarbose is a promising metabolic modifier that
could reduce the risk of cvd in patients with the metabolic syndrome. in this paper, we review the clinical utility of acarbose in
various cardiometabolic disorders.
link between postprandial hyperglycemia
and cvd in diabetes
in the last decade, several prospective studies have shown that
hyperglycemia itself could predict future cardiovascular events in
patients with diabetes [12,13]. in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,
10-year cardiovascular mortality increases threefold by tertiles of
blood glucose and hba1c [14]. there is a significant increase in the
risk of cvd death and all cvd events in type 2 diabetic subjects
with hba1c levels higher than 7.0 % compared with diabetic subjects with lower hba1c [15,16]. the conclusive answer to the question on the existence of cause-effect relationship between hyperglycemia and cvd may derive from intervention studies. in the united
kingdom prospective diabetes study (ukpds) study, intensive
blood glucose control has effectively reduced microvascular com*address correspondence to this author at the department of pathophysiology and therapeutics of diabetic vascular complications, kurume university school of medicine, kurume 830-0011, japan; tel:/fax: +81-942-317873; e-mail: shoichi@med.kurume-u.ac.jp

plications in type 2 diabetic patients [17]. however, the risk of
myocardial infarction has reduced slightly but not significantly by
about 15 %, and less than treatment of hypertension (21 %) or hypercholesterolemia (31 %). since the reduction of hyperglycemia is
small in this trial, the role of hyperglycemia in preventing cvd
may be underestimated. indeed, a continued reduction in microvascular risk and emergent risk reductions for myocardial infarction
and death from any cause were observed in 10-year follow-up of
ukpds [18].
insulin resistance is one of the determinants of postprandial
hyperglycemia [19]. recently, postprandial hyperglycemia was
shown to be of greater importance in cvd [20]. in the funagata
diabetes study, analysis of survival rates concluded that igt, but
not impaired fasting glucose, was a risk factor for cvd [21]. the
decode study revealed that 2-h post-load hyperglycemia was
associated with an increased risk of mortality from cvd, independent of fasting plasma glucose [22]. this study also showed that
abnormalities in 2-h plasma glucose were better predictors of mortality from cvd and non-cvd than fasting glucose alone [22].
furthermore, the diabetes intervention study (dis) identified postprandial hyperglycemia to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality [23]. since postprandial
hyperglycemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased intima-media thickness (imt) as well as a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of the common carotid arteries,
mild-to-moderate postprandial hyperglycemia could play a central
role in the development of atherosclerosis [24-27].
the relative contribution of postprandial glucose decreased
progressively from the lowest to the highest quintile of hba1c,
whereas that of fasting glucose increased gradually with increasing
levels of hba1c [28]. these observations suggest that the decrease
in hba1c levels could not necessarily reflect the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia, especially in poorly controlled diabetic
patients. this could partly explain why decreased hba1c levels did
not significantly lead to the reduction of the risk for cvd in
ukpds.
possible molecular mechanisms for the link
between postprandial hyperglycemia and
cvd
in vitro, intermittent and constant high glucose have been
shown to not only enhance apoptotic cell death, but also stimulate
expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion moleculeÂ© 2009 bentham science publishers ltd.

160 current drug metabolism, 2009, vol. 10, no. 2

1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1,  xxxg2048xxx ) and cytokines in
cultured endothelial cells [29,30]. hyperglycemia causes the endothelial cell damage in vitro via nadph oxidase- and/or mitochondrial electron transport chain-driven oxidative stress generation
[29,30]. the deleterious effects are even more evident in intermittent high glucose. these observations suggest that postprandial
hyperglycemic spike may be more important for the development of
vascular injury in diabetes.
postprandial hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress generation
in diabetic patients as well [31,32]. indeed, monnier et al. reported
that urinary excretion of an oxidative stress marker, 8-iso prostaglandin f2, was independently associated with mean amplitude of
glycemic excursions in type 2 diabetes, thus suggesting that glucose fluctuations during postprandial periods could exhibit a more
specific triggering effect on oxidative stress generation than chronic
sustained hyperglycemia [33]. there is a growing body of evidence
that oxidative stress generation is the pathogenic molecular mechanism linking postprandial hyperglycemia to endothelial dysfunction, an initial step of atherosclerosis [7,34-37].  xxxd2738xxx  (no)
undergoes a rapid reaction with superoxide anions to form peroxynitrite, a toxic metabolite of no, which could cause vascular
damage [35]. further, the loss of no permits increased activity of
the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-b (nf-b),
which leads to vascular inflammation and altered gene expression
of cytokines and growth factors [36,37]. moreover, postprandial
hyperglycemia-elicited oxidative stress generation induces oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, platelet activation and thrombin
generation as well, thereby participating in the development and
progression of atheroscleorsis in diabetes [38-40].
beneficial effects of acarbose,  -glucosidase inhibitor, on cardiometabolic disorders
acarbose is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of glucosidases in the brush border of the small intestine [8,41]. it is
the most widely prescribed -glucosidase inhibitor [8,41]. since glucosidases play a central role in the final breakdown of sucrose
and starch to absorbable monosaccharides, acarbose delays the
absorption of carbohydrate from the small intestine, thereby reducing postprandial hyperglycemia in vivo [8,41].
there are several reports to show that acarbose improves insulin resistance in animal models and patients with igt or diabetes
[9-11,42,43]. perez et al. showed that acarbose-treated obese diabetic wistar rats had lower levels of blood glucose, triglyceride,
leptin and insulin and an increase in adiponectin compared with
untreated animals [42]. in their study, adipocyte insulin responsiveness was also improved in acarbose-treated animals [42]. in addition, yamamoto et al. reported that acarbose-fed insulin-resistant
rats gained less weight or lost weight, compared with non-treated
rats [43]. they also showed that acarbose reduced visceral adipose
depots and fasting triglyceride, glucose, and insulin levels [43]. in
patients with igt or type 2 diabetic patients, acarbose was reported
to improve postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance as
well [10,11,44].
the metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, is a clustering of coronary risk factors such as high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol and hypertension [6,45]. it is well known that these metabolic abnormalities
can be induced in rats by fructose-rich diets [46]. indeed, we have
previously shown that hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia
with lowered hdl-cholesterol levels develop in rats that were fed a
high fructose diet for 4 weeks [46]. in our study, acarbose treatment
improved insulin resistance, increased hdl-cholesterol levels and
inhibited the elevation of systolic blood pressure in fructose-fed rats
[46]. further, oral administration of acarbose decreased serum levels of  xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ) and its expression in aorta in fructose-fed insulin resistant rats as well [47]. mcp-

yamagishi et al.

1 has been postulated to play an important role in the early phase of
atherosclerosis by initiating monocyte recruitment to the vessel wall
[48], and its expression is elevated in human atherosclerotic plaques
[49]. moreover, the selective targeting of  xxxg370xxx , the receptor for
 xxxg357xxx , was shown to markedly decrease atheromataous lesion
formation in apoe knockout mice [50]. these findings suggest that
acarbose could exert atheroprotective properties in diabetes, at least
in part, by suppressing monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells by
inhibiting repetitive postprandial hyperglycemia and/or improving
insulin resistance. indeed, azuma et al. reported that administration
of acarbose reduced the number of monocytes adherent to aortic
endothelial layer, improved acethycholine-dependent vasodilation,
and reduced intimal thickening of the aorta in non-obese type 2
diabetic rats [51]. acarbose also attenuated several of the characteristic hepatic alterations of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), a
hepatic manifestation of insulin resistance: there was less steatosis
and inflammation, with a significant reduction in tumor necrosis
factor- expression [52,53].
in patients with type 2 diabetes, acarbose treatment was shown
to not only increase serum  xxxg1337xxx  mass levels [54], but
also decrease circulating levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein
(ldl)-cholesterol, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) and
fibrinogen [9,55]. further, a single administration of acarbose has
been reported to improve postprandial glucose excursion and endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients as well [56].
acarbose was shown to reduce retinal capillary and glomerular
basement membrane thickness in diabetic rats, probably via suppression of formation of advanced glycation end products (ages)
[57-60]. these findings provide another beneficial aspects of acarbose; acarbose could prevent the development and progression of
diabetic microangiopathy by blocking the harmful effects of ages.
the stop-niddm trial revealed that acarbose improved postprandial hyperglycemia and subsequently reduced the risk of diabetes in patients with igt [61]. recently, acarbose treatment for 3
years was found to slow the progression of imt of the carotid arteries and to reduce the incidence of cvd and newly diagnosed hypertension in igt patients [62,63]. acarbose significantly reduced
body weight and increased hdl-cholesterol levels in these patients
as well. further, a meta-analysis of seven double-blind placebocontrolled, randomized trials has shown that intervention with acarbose prevents myocardial infarction and cvd in type 2 diabetic
patients [64]. in this analysis, glycemic control, triglyceride levels,
body weight and systolic blood pressure were also improved in
acarbose-treated patients. although selection bias, inadequate
blinding, bias in data analysis and reporting, and potential sponsoring bias in the stop-niddm trial were pointed out by some researchers [65], the above-mentioned observations suggest that prevention of postprandial hyperglycemia by acarbose may be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing the increased risk for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and cvd in patients with
diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. acarbose is known to improve
postprandial hyperglycemia by delaying the release of glucose from
complex carbohydrates in the absence of an increase in insulin secretion. improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia itself could be
associated with amelioration in insulin sensitivity. possible mechanisms by which acarbose could exert beneficial cardiometabolic
actions in diabetes are presented in fig. (1).
conclusions
as described above, postprandial hyperglycemia induces adhesion molecule expression and stimulates cytokine productions in
vascular wall cells via oxidative stress generation, thus being involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. further large clinical studies will clarify whether aggressive treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance
with acarbose could reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disorders in
patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.
