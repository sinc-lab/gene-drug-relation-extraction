abstract
the (r,r) and (s,s) enantiomers of 2-[(2-methoxyphenoxy)phenylmethyl]morpholine (mener) have been radiolabelled with carbon-11
in good yield and at high specific activity. these radiotracers are close analogues of  xxxd3089xxx , a potent and selective ligand for the
 xxxg2148xxx  ( xxxg2148xxx ). they were examined as potential ligands for imaging  xxxg2148xxx  in vivo by positron emission tomography
(pet). the in vivo brain distribution of both [11c]-labeled enantiomers were evaluated in rats. following tail-vein injection of the
(r,r)-enantiomer regional brain uptake and washout of radioactivity was homogeneous at all time points examined (5-60 min). in contrast,
administration of the (s,s)-enantiomer produced a heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in brain with highest uptake in the
hypothalamus, a  xxxg2148xxx  rich region, and lowest uptake in the striatum, a brain region devoid of  xxxg2148xxx . hypothalamus to striatum ratios of 2.5
to one were achieved at 60 min post injection of (s,s)-[11c]-mener. pre-injection of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors,  xxxd3089xxx 
or desipramine, reduced hypothalamus to striatum ratios to near unity while reuptake inhibitors of dopamine and serotonin had no significant
effect on binding. in vitro autoradiography studies (rat brain slices) with (s,s)-[11c]-mener produced a regional distribution pattern that
was consistent with the reported distribution of  xxxg2148xxx . (s,s)-[11c]-mener has the potential to be the first successful pet ligand to image

1. introduction
the  xxxg2148xxx  ( xxxg2148xxx ) is a 12 membranespanning protein which plays a major role in terminating the
physiological effects of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft
[4,17]. despite recognition that the  xxxg2148xxx  ( xxxg2148xxx ) is a site of action of many old (e.g. desipramine) and new (e.g.  xxxd3089xxx ) antidepressant drugs in the
brain, there have been only a few attempts to develop
radiotracers for imaging  xxxg2148xxx  in vivo in the central nervous
system, either by positron emission tomography (pet) or
single photon emission computed tomography (spect).

etine which demonstrated modest specific binding in mice
[10]. kung et al. synthesized an iodinated derivative of
tomoxetine which showed no specific binding in vivo in rat
brain and very high lung uptake [7]. the radiosynthesis of
[11c]-desipramine has also been reported but no in vivo data
was included [22]. thus there exists a real need for a
radiotracer which is capable of the in vivo tomographic
imaging  xxxg2148xxx .
 xxxd3089xxx  is a potent selective inhibitor of norepinephrine re-uptake and has been marketed as an anti-depressant
in several countries [28].  xxxd3089xxx  (fig. 1) has two chiral
centers and formally exists as a pair of diastereoisomeric
enantiomers, with the (r,r)/(s,s) pair being somewhat
more potent than the (r,s/(s/r) pair [15,16]. it is marketed
as a mixture of the (r,r) and (s,s) enantiomers, with the
(s,s) enantiomer being the more potent and selective at
 xxxg2148xxx  with a eudismic ratio of 30 with respect to inhibiting

the reuptake of norepinephrine [29]. the original report on
the synthesis and activity of  xxxd3089xxx  [15] also noted that
its methyl analogue 2-[(2-methoxyphenoxy)phenylmethyl]
morpholine, (methylnorethylreboxetine, mener, fig. 1)
was three times more potent than  xxxd3089xxx  itself in inhibiting the reuptake of [3h]-norepinephrine in rat synaptosomes. this, together with the relative ease of introducing
[11c]-methyl groups into molecules [8], and an anticipated
reduced lipophilicity, made (s,s)-[11c]-mener a particularly attractive candidate as a radiotracer for the in vivo
imaging of  xxxg2148xxx .
we report here the radiosynthesis of both enantiomers of
[11c]-mener and assess their potential for pet imaging of
 xxxg2148xxx  by examining their in vivo and in vitro binding properties in rat brain using regional dissection techniques and
autoradiography.
2. methods
purifications and analyses of radioactive mixtures were
performed by high performance liquid chromatogrpahy
(hplc) with an in-line uv (254 nm) detector in series with
a nai crystal radioactivity detector (synthesis and qc) or a
berhhold lb507a radioactivity detector (metabolite analysis) isolated radiochemical yields were determined with a
dose-calibrator (capintec crc-712m). thf was freshly
distilled under nitrogen from lialh4 while dmf was distilled from bao and stored over 4å molecular sieves prior
to use. (s,s/r,r)- xxxd3089xxx  mesylate, (s,s)- xxxd3089xxx 
mesylate, (s,s/r,r)-mener mesylate, (s,s)-(2-(morpholin-2-yl-phenyl-methoxy)-phenol, and (r,r)-(2-(morpholin2-yl-phenyl-methoxy)-phenol were supplied by eli lilly
(indianapolis, usa); the last two with unassigned absolute
con|figuration (vide infra). all other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. all animal experiments
were carried out under humane conditions, with approval
from the animal care committee at the camh, and in
accordance with the guidelines set forth by the canadian
council on animal care.
2.1. determination of the absolute configuration of
precursors
(s,s/r,r)- xxxd3089xxx  mesylate [16](2 mg) or (s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  mesylate was partitioned between saturated aque-

ous nahco3 (1 ml) and etoac (0.3 ml). (s)-␣-methoxy␣-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride (2 ␮l) was added
to the organic layer and the mixture briefly shaken. hplc
analysis showed that the reaction was complete after 2 min.
the diastereoisomers were resolved on a supelco lc-(r)dnbpg 5␮ column (250 x 4.6 mm) with 100/5 (v/v) hexane/ethanol as eluent at 1 ml/min (k’ss 2.9, k’rr 3.5; ␣ ⫽
1.21).
a solution of 0.5 mg 2-(morpholin-2-yl-phenyl-methoxy)-phenol of unknown absolute con|figuration (either
ss or rr, vide ante) in dmf (75 ␮l) was treated with
tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (3 ␮l, 1n in meoh) and
ethyl iodide (1␮l). after 10 min at ambient temperature,
volatiles were removed by bubbling argon gas through the
solution. the residue was then derivatised with (s)-␣-methoxy-␣-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride as described
above and the product identified as derivatised (s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  by co-injections with the standard derivatives prepared
above.
2.2. (s,s)-[11c]-mener
[11c]-methylations were carried out inside an hplc
sample loop using our previously described method [25].
briefly, the normethyl precursor (s,s)-2-(morpholin-2-ylphenyl-methoxy)-phenol, 0.5-0.6 mg) was dissolved in
dmf (75 ␮l) and treated with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution (1n in meoh, 3 ␮l). this solution was
loaded onto an hplc injection loop (2 ml) on a valco™
high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) injector
valve in the load position. [11c]-iodomethane (produced as
previously described [23] was swept into the hplc loop
coated with precursor solution by a stream of n2 gas (8
ml/min) at ambient temperature. radioactivity trapped on
the loop is detected by a proximal radiation detector. when
radioactivity peaked in the loop (3-4 min), the flow of n2
was stopped and the reaction allowed to proceed for 4 min
at ambient temperature. the contents of the loop were then
quantitatively injected onto the hplc purification column
by simply changing the position of the injection valve from
the load to the inject position and the reaction mixture
purified by semi-prep hplc; phenomenex prodigy c18
10␮ (250 x 10mm, 30% thf:70% h2o ⫹ 0.1n nh4hco2,
5 ml/min). the desired fraction was collected, evaporated
to dryness at 70 °c, and the residue taken up in 10 ml of
sterile saline. the saline solution of (s,s)-[11c]-mener
was passed through a sterile 0.22 ␮m filter into a sterile,
pyrogen-free bottle containing aqueous sodium bicarbonate
(1 ml, 8.4%). an aliquot (100 ␮l) of the formulated solution was used to establish the chemical and radiochemical
purity and specific activity of the final solution by analytical
hplc; phenomenex prodigy c18 10␮ (250 x 4.5mm, 30%
ch3cn:70% h2o ⫹ 0.1n nh4hco2, 4 ml/min).
further evidence for the identity of the radiolabelled
products were achieved by co-injection with authentic
“cold” material using a further two different hplc columns

(alltech c8 econosil, and waters c18 novapak). the optical
purity of the radiolabelled product was determined as follows. two ml of the final formulated solution was added to
a vial containing 1 g of nahco3 and 0.5 ml of etoac. the
mixture was shaken vigourously and (s)-␣-methoxy-␣-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride (1 ␮l) added. after two
min an aliquot of the organic layer was analyzed by hplc
(supelco 100/20/2 hexane/dichloroethane/etoh, 1 ml/min
(k’ss 2.76, k’rr 3.39; ␣ ⫽ 1.23).
2.3. (r,r)-[11c]-mener
this enantiomer was synthesized in an identical manner
to the (s,s) enantiomer using the corresponding (r,r)phenolic precursor.
2.3.1. log p measurements
the partition coefficient of [11c]-mener determined
between 1-octanol and 0.02 m phosphate buffer at ph 7.4
was measured by a previously described method [27].
2.3.2. autoradiography
twenty-micron coronal sections were cut at 0.3 mm
intervals from frozen, unfixed rat brains and thaw-mounted
onto fisher superfrost* slides (fisher, canada), dried under
vacuum and kept at -80°c until used. all steps of the
receptor binding autoradiography procedures were performed in 50-mmtris-hcl buffer, ph 7.4, containing 300
mm nacl and 5-mm kcl. slides were brought to room
temperature and pre-incubated in buffer for 30 minutes (to
remove endogenous ligands). they were then incubated for
10 minutes in 8 nm [11c]-mener (547 mci/␮mol at the
start of film exposure). a separate set of slides was incubated for 10 min in 8 nm [11c]-mener in the presence of
100 ␮m desipramine in order to define non-specific binding. all slides were then rinsed 3 times for one minute each
in ice-cold buffer, and dipped for 10 seconds in ice-cold
distilled water. slides were then quickly dried under cool air
and exposed to kodak biomax mr film for 24 hr. films
were developed in a kodak m35a x-omat automated film
processor.
2.3.3. biodistribution in rats
rats (male, sprague-dawley, 210-250 g) were kept on a
reversed 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle and allowed food and

87

water ad libitum. a previously described method was used
to determine the regional brain uptake of radioactivity [24].
briefly, rats, in a restraining box, received 8-33 mbq of
high specific activity radiotracer (1-2 nmole) in 0.3 ml of
buffered saline via the tail vein, vasodilated in a warm water
bath. rats were killed by decapitation at various time intervals after radiotracer administration, the brain removed and
stored on ice. brain regions were excised, blotted and
weighed and blood collected (from the trunk). radioactivity
in tissues was assayed in an automated gamma counter,
back corrected to time of injection, using diluted aliquots of
the initial injected dose as standards. non-specific binding
was defined as the %injected dose in the striatum, a brain
region containing a negligible density of  xxxg2148xxx  [3,18] and
specific binding was defined as %injected dose/gram (brain
region) minus %injected dose/gram (striatum).
2.3.4. blocking studies in rat
for pharmacological studies, rats received an injection of
a solution (1 ml/kg body wgt., saline or 5% ethanol in
saline, ph 4.5, for gbr 12909) of the pharmacological
agent while control animals received only saline 15-20 min
prior to the radiotracer injection. animals were killed 60
min post-radiotracer injection and brain regions dissected
and counted as described above.
2.3.5. metabolism studies
rats (male, sprague-dawley, 250-300 g) received 200250 mbq of high specific activity (s,s)-[11c]-mener (4-5
nmole) in 0.5 ml of buffered saline via the tail vein.
animals were killed at 30 min or 60 min post-injection by
decapitation, blood collected from the trunk in a heparinized
tube, and the whole brain surgically removed from the skull
and stored on ice. control animals which received no radiotracer were also killed, blood collected, and their brains
excised and stored on ice. two mbq of (s,s)-[11c]-mener
in 10 ␮l of buffered saline was added to the control brains
and control blood only.
all brains were homogenized (polytron, setting 7) in 5
ml of ice-cold 80% aq. ethanol and centrifuged (17,000
rpm, 15 min). the supernatants and pellets were counted for
radioactivity, the supernatants were then evaporated to near
dryness and reconstituted in 1% aqueous acetonitrile (4 ml)
for hplc analysis. blood was centrifuged to separate the
plasma (2 ml) which was used directly for hplc analysis.
hplc analysis of plasma and brain extracts were performed by minor modifications of the method described by
hilton [11]. briefly, samples were loaded onto a 5 ml
hplc injector loop (valco texas) and injected onto a small
capture column (4.6 x 20 mm) packed in house with oasis
hlb 30␮m, waters, nj). the capture column was washed
with 1% aqueous acetonitrile (2 ml/min) for four min then
back-flushed (30% acetonitile/70% h2o ⫹ 0.1n ammonium formate, ph 4, 2ml/min) onto a phenomenex 5 ␮

c18aqua column (150 x 4.6 mm). both column effluents
were monitored by a berthold lb507a flow radioactivity
detector. all radioactivity data was corrected for physical
decay and integrated using a pc. hold-up of radioactivty in
the hplc system was less than 2% of applied radioactivity.

3. results
hplc conditions were not found which allowed a separation of the (s,s) from the (r,r) enantiomers of  xxxd3089xxx  or mener. however the diastereoisomeric amides
formed upon reaction with (s)-␣-methoxy-␣-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride were well resolved using a
chiral phase hplc column. this allowed the assignation of
the absolute con|figuration of the phenolic precursors by a
sequence of o-ethylation and n-acylation, followed by a
comparison of the hplc properties of the diastereoisomeric
amides with the amide derived from authentic (s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  [16].
radiosynthesis of both enantiomers of [11c]-mener
(scheme 1) proceeded smoothly using [11c]-iodomethane,

the corresponding phenolic precursor, and our previously
describe “loop” method [25]. radiochemical yields were
25-40% (uncorrected, based on [11c]-iodomethane trapped)
in a synthesis time of 25 min (from end-of bombardment).
final products were sterile, pyrogen-free and radiochemically pure (⬎ 98%) by tlc and hplc and contained less
than 0.02 ␮g/ml of normethyl precursor. a typical bombardment of 10 ␮ahr resulted in 100 mci of final, formulated product with specific activities of 35-65 gbq/␮mole at
end-of-synthesis. optical purities were ⬎97% and the log p
(ph 7.4) for [11c]-mener was 2.35 (⫾ 0.06, n⫽12).
upon tail vein injection of s,s-[11c]-mener in rats
moderate brain uptake was observed (0.53% injected dose/
organ at 5 min post-injection) with a slow washout of
radioactivity in  xxxg2148xxx  rich regions such as hypothalamus and
cortex and a faster washout of activity in the striatum, a
region lacking in  xxxg2148xxx  [3,18]. hypothalamus to striatum
ratios of 2.5 to one were reached at 60 min post injection
(fig. 2a). rank order of region to striatum ratios was
hypothalamus ⬎ hippocampus ⬇ cortex ⬇ thalamus ⬇
brain stem ⬎ cerebellum ⬎ striatum. in contrast, no regional retention of radioactivity was found upon injection of
the enantiomeric radiotracer r,r-[11c]-mener (fig. 2b).

fig. 3. effects of pre-treatment of rats with various drugs on (s,s)-[11c]-mener binding in rat brain regions. rats were treated with drug or saline (tail-vein)
15-20 min prior to administration of the radiotracer and killed 60 min post radiotracer injection.

instead, a relatively homogeneous distribution, with similar
washout rates, was found in all examined brain regions.
pre-treatment of rats with the norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors  xxxd3089xxx  [28] or desipramine [12], followed by
injection of s,s-[11c]-mener, resulted in no specific retention of radioactivity in hypothalamus or other brain regions compared to striatum (fig. 3.) however pre-treatment
of rats with dasb (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [26]),
l-deprenyl (a  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitor [9]) or
gbr 15909 (a dopamine reuptake inhibitor [21]) had no
significant effect on the regional distribution of radioactivity
following injection of s,s-[11c]-mener compared with
saline injected controls (fig. 3).
hplc analysis of rat plasma showed that s,s-[11c]mener was quickly metabolized with only 50% unchanged radiotracer present at 30 min post-injection and
20% after 60 min. radioactive metabolites were all hydrophilic. hplc analysis of whole rat brain extracts showed
that greater than 95% of radioactivity in the brain was
unchanged s,s-[11c]-mener.
in vitro incubation of slide-mounted rat brain sections
with 10 nm [11c]-mener for 10 min produced a regional
distribution pattern that was remarkably similar to patterns
previously reported in autoradiographic assays of
[3h]nisoxetine in rat brain [2,20]. as illustrated in fig. 4,
this included high levels in the anteroventral nucleus of the
thalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the locus co-

eruleus and subcoeruleus area. coincubation with 100 ␮m
desipramine abolished binding in all cases (fig. 4, panel e).
4. discussion
the radiosynthesis of both enantiomers of [11c]-mener was rapid and effective. selective methylation of the
phenoxide anion was achieved without protection of the
morpholine nitrogen. a reaction time of 4.5 min at ambient
temperature was sufficient to ensure ⬎90% conversion of
[11c]-iodomethane into product. curiously, under the employed reverse-phase hplc conditions using thf as the
organic co-solvent, the more lipophilic product eluted before the precursor, enabling a fast and efficient separation
(fig. 5). with acetonitrile as co-solvent, the expected order
of elution was observed, i.e. precursor before product. it has
been suggested that the “loop” technique of performing
[11c]-methylations suffers from the disadvantage of hplc
column degradation due to the injection of 2 ml of nitrogen
with the reaction mixture onto the column [13]. such concerns are unfounded. the hplc column used to produce the
chromatograms in fig. 5 had been used for over two hundred such injections.
the marked differences in regional brain uptake of the
two carbon-11 labeled strongly suggests that the preferential
binding in  xxxg2148xxx  rich regions such as the hypothalamus and
thalamus compared with the  xxxg2148xxx  poor striatal region is a
reflection of binding of (s,s)-[11c]-mener to  xxxg2148xxx . this

hypothesis is strengthened by the results of drug blocking
studies (fig. 3). only the  xxxg2148xxx  selective drugs,  xxxd3089xxx 
and desipramine, inhibit the preferential regional brain uptake of radioactivity while dasb and gbr 12909, selective drugs for the serotonin transporter and  xxxg2149xxx  respectively, have no significant effect on the
distribution of radioactivity. further evidence for (s,s)[11c]-mener binding to  xxxg2148xxx  is provided by the pattern of
binding obtained from the in vitro autoradiography studies
(fig. 4).
a necessary requirement for an imaging radiotracer of
central nervous system receptors is a lack of radiolabelled
metabolites in the brain. the presence of such radioactive
species can reduce signal to noise ratios and, more significantly, can obfuscate the quantification of the imaging process. only polar metabolites were found in rat plasma by
hplc analysis, following tail-vein injection of (s,s)-[11c]mener. such hydrophilic metabolites are not likely to
cross the blood brain barrier, at least by a passive diffusion
mechanism. direct examination of rat brain extracts showed
only minor amounts of radioactive metabolites (⬍ 5%),
most of which could be accounted for by the contribution
from the brain vascular compartment. unless a species spe-

cific metabolic pathway is followed, radioactive metabolites
should not confound the use of (s,s)-[11c]-mener in imaging the living human brain using pet.
perhaps one reason why it has proved to be so difficult to
develop a radiotracer for in vivo imaging of  xxxg2148xxx  is the low
amount of receptor protein in the brain compared with other
successfully imaged systems such as dat, and sert. estimates of the bmax of  xxxg2148xxx  in rat brain regions vary
enormously in the literature, [1–3,5,6,18 –20,30]. nevertheless, it is probable that levels of  xxxg2148xxx  are substantially lower
than e.g. sert or dat. brunswick et al found that  xxxg2148xxx 
bmax values in e.g. hypothalamus were at least four fold
lower than sert bmax values in the same region and 17
fold lower than dat bmax in the striatum [5]. thus in vivo
imaging of  xxxg2148xxx  by tomographic techniques represents a
significant challenge.
(s,s)-[11c]-mener has demonstrated promising in vivo
pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and metabolism for a potential in vivo  xxxg2148xxx  radiotracer. to determine whether this
ligand provides sufficient signal and contrast to succeed in
imaging  xxxg2148xxx  in humans by pet will require human imaging trials. while this work has focused on the imaging of
 xxxg2148xxx  in the central nervous system, it should be noted that

(s,s)-[11c]-mener may also be worth evaluating as a
radiotracer to image cardiac sympathetic innervation [14].
