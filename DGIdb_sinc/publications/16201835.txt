correspondence
aimed at both professions. assessing current awareness
could provide a basis for further research, leading to the
development of effective measures that will raise awareness
levels and motivate students to participate in future
campaigns that seek to combat disease mongering.
most medical and pharmaceutical students in india are
not aware of the issue of disease mongering; neither do
most of them know that recent audits have shown medical
interventions and adverse drug reactions to be major causes
of death and disability in the us [4].
articles have been published warning the profession
about disease mongering [5–7], but for the most part
these warnings have not been heeded. one is reminded of
aristotle, who so rightly observed that “truth could inﬂuence
only half a score of men in a century, while falsehood and
mystery would drag millions by the nose.”
we prepared a 20-item questionnaire (text s1) about
disease mongering and the inﬂuence of the drug industry
on clinical practice. the questionnaires were distributed
among a random sample of 250 ﬁnal-year medical and 250
ﬁnal-year pharmaceutical students. the overall response rate
was 406 out of 500 (81.2%), comprising 199 medical and 207
pharmaceutical students. of the medical students, 30 out
of 199 (15%) were able to explain disease mongering with
relevant examples. of the pharmaceutical students, 114 out
of 207 (55%) were able to do so, suggesting that awareness
of the problem was much greater among these students.
interestingly, however, 87 out of 114 pharmaceutical students
believed the government, not the pharmaceutical industry,
was responsible for the problem.
all the students, both medical and pharmaceutical,
said they had frequently seen drugs dispensed without
prescription. they had also often seen patients visit local
pharmacists for medical advice. they agreed that both
practices were unethical. however, both the medical and
the pharmaceutical students were unaware of the incentives
offered by drug companies to pharmacists for buying their
drugs, which lead to unethical dispensing.
we believe that our small project, despite its inherent
limitations, has thrown some light on the situation.
pharmaceutical students, who are exposed to the drug
industry to some extent during their studies, have some
idea of the magnitude of the problem, while the majority
of medical students have no idea that even their textbooks
are written with the help of money that comes from drug
companies [8]. we need to make a more concerted attempt
to educate the student community of all the health-care
professions, in order to counter this unfair tendency. the
government should undertake major initiatives to ensure
that drugs are only dispensed with a prescription from
a licensed physician. medical associations and medical
college administrators should alert their members to
cross-check the information provided in drug company
literature. medical students should be warned about disease
mongering through the display of posters, and through the
organization of essay competitions and interactive plays.
students can play a further role by conducting regional and
national surveys of the awareness of the public concerning
this serious issue. 

awareness and attitudes about
disease mongering among medical
and pharmaceutical students

pharmaceutical companies throughout the world market
their products aggressively through a variety of promotional
campaigns [1]. in india, these marketing practices pose a
greater problem because the restrictions on drug dispensing
are very limited—drugs often being dispensed without a
prescription from a licensed physician. the companies take
full advantage of this situation. as many patients in india
are poor and illiterate, and lack information on health care,
they often visit local pharmacists or quacks for medical
advice. pharmacists routinely dispense drugs illegally over
the counter. we visited 40 local pharmacy stores for medical
advice for a feigned medical ailment, and we found that
all 40 pharmacists dispensed drugs, including expensive
antibiotics [2].
pharmaceutical promotional campaigns in india, unlike
those in developed countries (where pharmacists have little
inﬂuence on drug sales), are not only aimed at changing
the prescribing habits of physicians but also at pharmacists
and quacks. pharmaceutical companies in india offer
various schemes and incentives (including television sets,
motorcycles, and the opportunity for higher proﬁt margins)
to lure pharmacists into buying more drugs than they would
normally need. as a result, the pharmacists make every effort
to sell these drugs to patients visiting them for medical advice.
they may also associate themselves with quacks or physicians
in their efforts to shift their stock of the drugs.
in developed countries, dubious pharmaceutical marketing
practices would soon attract the attention of watchdog bodies
and social activists, but in india they go undetected. we
believe that this situation demands proactive action on the
part of the medical profession and also of the government.
the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry to medicalize
human life should be resisted. we do not wish india to be
in the same position as the countries of the west, where
adverse drug reactions are responsible for a signiﬁcant
proportion of hospital admissions and require millions of
outpatient visits and corrective measures. in the united
states, for example, there are about 100,000 deaths due
to medical errors every year, of which about 7,000 are
attributed to drug reactions [3].
we believe it is important to assess current awareness about
disease mongering among medical and pharmaceutical
students, as pharmaceutical promotional campaigns are

to maternal syphilis, which includes 460,000 abortions or
stillbirths, 270,000 low-birth-weight babies, and 270,000
cases of congenital syphilis each year [4]. this burden is
concentrated in africa and exhibits considerable geographic
overlap with hiv infection. syphilis accounts for 20% of
genital ulcer diseases and is a cofactor in transmission of hiv,
and both infections appear to progress more rapidly when
they occur together [5].
infection with syphilis is curable, and control is possible
with existing drugs (speciﬁcally penicillin). however, little
attention has been given to this in context of the big three.
azithromycin is included in the chemotherapy package
proposed by hotez et al. for the control of trachoma, and
there are clear synergies with syphilis control. a recent
trial in tanzania demonstrated that a single dose of oral
azithromycin is as effective as injectable  xxxd2871xxx 
benzathine in treating early and latent syphilis [6]. however,
some caution is needed concerning the widespread use of
azithromycin for syphilis in view of the recent emergence of
azithromycin-resistant treponema pallidum [7].
there are other possible synergies in having a strategy
including syphilis control; e.g., during routine antenatal
care, chemotherapy for soil-transmitted helminths could be
provided at the same time as offering voluntary counselling
and testing (vct) for hiv infection and screening for
maternal syphilis. the control of syphilis has been shown
to be highly cost-effective. if the control of syphilis was
integrated into programs dealing with the four priority
disease groups advocated by hotez et al., then the costeffectiveness of tackling not only syphilis but also the
other four major public health priorities would improve.
furthermore, it would lessen the chance of avoiding death
from one disease but dying from another [8].
while it might be hoped that the case for giving priority
to syphilis would have been accepted and explicit emphasis
given to programs to control this disease, this has not
happened. unfortunately, limited attention is given to syphilis
control as part of the several partnerships devoted to the big
three. maybe this is because syphilis has historically had a
social stigma, and has, therefore, been neglected. now is the
time to change this as part of a pro-poor strategy to meet the
millennium development goals. we suggest it is explicitly
included in the rapid-impact package for neglected tropical
diseases. 

peter hotez and colleagues [1] provide a persuasive case for
incorporating a rapid-impact package for “neglected tropical
diseases” with programs for hiv/aids, tuberculosis, and
malaria as part of a pro-poor strategy for improving health in
the developing world. however, we believe there is a disease
that has a high claim to be included in partnerships and
initiatives devoted to what the authors term the “big three”,
and yet has been largely ignored.
on the basis of the criteria identiﬁed by hotez et al., the
case for giving explicit priority to programs to control syphilis
and particularly congenital syphilis is high [2]. in 2002, there
were 157,000 deaths contributing to more than 4 million
disability-adjusted life years (dalys) (see annex tables 2 and
3 in [3]). these estimates exclude the burden attributable

heidi greulich and colleagues [1] have demonstrated
the signiﬁcance of insertion mutations in the epidermal
growth factor receptor (egfr) (exon 20) for tumorigenesis
and responsiveness to  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) in
lung cancers. they reported that different types of egfr
mutations conveyed different sensitivity to tkis. although
several previous studies have suggested that tumors harboring
mutations in the egfr kinase domain were sensitive to tkis
such as geﬁtinib or  xxxd2029xxx  [2,3], others had reported an
association between the t790m mutation in exon 20 and
the resistance to tkis [4,5]. as we learn more about the
relationship between egfr status (including gene copy
number, mutation status, and mutation type) and drug
sensitivity, decisions about treatment with tkis for patients
with non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) become more
complex.
previously, we reported her2 mutational status, as well
as egfr and kras, in a large number of nsclcs [6].
we found that 22% of tumors had egfr kinase domain
mutations (149 out of 671). of these 149, 15 of them were
insertion mutations in exon 20. the more common types
of mutations—i.e., deletion in exon 19 (68 out of 149) and
l858r in exon 21 (61 out of 149)—were more frequent in
women and in “never smokers” (with p values of less than
0.001), whereas the exon 20 insertion mutations showed
no bias for sex (seven in males versus eight in females)
or smoking status (seven in smokers versus eight in never
smokers). we have no data regarding tki sensitivity for the
15 patients with insertion mutations to date, but based on the
results from others and our own in vitro data, they may not
beneﬁt from the conventional tkis, despite the fact that their
tumors have egfr kinase domain mutations.
to maximize beneﬁt to patients, we should determine the
exact type of mutation for an individual tumor and determine
whether it conveys sensitivity or resistance prior to tki therapy.
the development and clinical application of novel agents
overcoming resistance should yield a more effective targeted
therapy for tumors with all types of egfr mutations. 

authors’ reply
damian walker and godfrey walker [1] make a strong
case for adding congenital syphilis to our proposed list of
neglected tropical diseases (ntds). indeed, we would hasten
to add all of the major treponemal infections—including
yaws, endemic syphilis (bejel), and pinta—could potentially
qualify as ntds. leptospirosis and bartonellosis might also
qualify as important neglected bacterial infections, while
amoebiasis is an important yet neglected protozoan infection.
therefore, it is possible that in the future our list of 13–15
ntds could expand to approximately 20 conditions. in the
meantime, we are working to establish a set of consensus
guidelines for this important list of ntds. 

expressed explicitly in terms of the subcategories of the
test population, the positive predictive value is the ratio
represented by (true positives)/(true positives + false
positives), and the prevalence is the ratio represented by
(true positives + false negatives)/(true positives + false
negatives + true negatives + false positives).
the calculus is easily adapted to compute the probabilitybased likelihood ratio for the absence of disease in a given
patient. in this case, the post-negative-test probability of
disease absence (termed the “negative predictive value”) is
the ratio represented by (true negatives)/(true negatives +
false negatives), and the pre-test probability is one minus the
disease prevalence. the negative probability-based likelihood
ratio is, then, the ratio represented by the post-test probability
divided by the pre-test probability.
a more descriptive term for the probability-based
likelihood ratio would be the “probability magnifying power,”
since it leads to the expanded probability of the presence (or
absence) of disease yielded by a positive (or negative) test
result. 

mischievous odds ratios
william steinsmith
pieter reitsma and colleagues have explored—in a
population of patients anticoagulated with coumarin
congeners—the connection between the presence of mutant
alleles of a single gene and the risk of haemorrhage [1].
using as their denominator the odds for bleeding in a
patient without mutant alleles, and using as their numerator
the odds for patients with each of the two mutant alleles, the
authors propose the resulting odds ratios as surrogates for the
relative risk of haemorrhage.
it should be noted, however, that the conﬂation of an odds
ratio with a relative risk is not generally justiﬁed [2,3]. the
relative risk is the ratio of two probabilities (p2/p1), whereas
the corresponding odds ratio is [p1/(1−p1)]/[p2/(1−p2)].
equating these two ratios requires that p1 = p2, i.e., that the
risk ratio be unity.
in reitsma and colleagues’ paper, none of the eight
odds ratios presented in table 2 turn out identical with the
corresponding calculated risk ratio, and the most discordant
pair of values diverge by a factor of about 1.4, i.e., the odds
ratio of 2.6 corresponding to a relative risk of 1.9.
mischievous conﬂation of odds ratios with probability ratios
is widespread in the literature dealing with laboratory testing,
with the odds ratio (confusingly termed the “likelihood
ratio”) typically presented as surrogate for the corresponding
ratio of probabilities.
the power of a positive laboratory test to enhance the
likelihood of disease presence in a given patient (properly
termed the “positive probability-based likelihood ratio”) is
the ratio of two probabilities: the probability that the patient
who tested positive is truly diseased (termed the “positive
predictive value”) divided by the probability of disease in the
pre-test population (termed the “disease prevalence”).

authors’ reply
william steinsmith is correct that the odds ratio (or) is used
to approximate the relative risk, but incorrect that in this
instance, and most other ones, the two would differ by more
than a trivial amount, since he has failed to appreciate the
case-control design.
indeed, if the cumulative risk of disease is p1 in the
exposed and p0 in the nonexposed, the relative risk (p1/
p0) only equates the or, [p1/(1−p1)]/[p0/(1−p0)], when
exposure confers no excess risk. however, in a case-control
study, p1 and p0 cannot be directly estimated (nor, obviously,
can their odds), and the or is the only possible estimator
(hence its frequent use).
we will illustrate the theory starting with a cohort study,
and then moving from this to a case-control study. when
risks are low, the or will always be a good approximation of
the relative risk because or = (p1/p0)/[(1−p1)/(1−p0)],
in which the second part of the term will be close to one.
so, suppose a trait is present in 20% of a population, with
a risk of disease of 1% in those without the trait, and 2.5%

evaluate the presence or absence of disease. this is not the
analysis one would use in aetiologic studies such as ours.
generally, since most diseases are infrequent, ors are
good estimators of relative risks under this “rare disease
assumption”. for a disease with a frequency of 10%, which
is high, the difference between or and rr is still only 10%.
on a higher theoretical level, one could argue that the
parameter to estimate is not the relative risk, but the rate
ratio, i.e., the ratio of two incidence rates. while a cumulative
risk is a probability, an incidence has time −1 as its unit, and
lies between zero and inﬁnity. since the incidence rate is
the basic measure of disease occurrence, the rate ratio is the
prime comparator, to be preferred over relative risks (which,
over time, will converge to unity, because, to quote john
maynard keynes, “in the long run we are all dead”). it can
be shown that under certain sampling conditions, i.e., when
controls are sampled from a dynamic population, there is no
need for the “rare disease assumption”, and the or is the
exact equivalent of an incidence rate ratio [4]. 

in those with the trait, i.e., a relative risk of 2.5. these are
likely to be close to the actual annual numbers for risk of
haemorrhage under anticoagulant treatment with and
without the  xxxg2418xxx  variant [1,2]. if we follow 10,000
people for one year—8,000 without the trait, of whom 80 will
develop disease; 2,000 with the trait, of whom 50 will develop
disease—rr = (50/2,000)/(80/8,000) = 2.5000, and or =
(50/1,950)/(80/7,920) = 2.5385.when the or is written out
in full to [(50/2,000)/(1,950/2,000)]/[(80/8,000)/(7920/8
000)], this can easily be reduced to the above.
in a case-control study, all cases are included, but there are
only a fraction of all noncases (controls). with a sampling
fraction of 1/10, the case-control study sampled from this
cohort would look like the following: 80 cases without and
50 cases with the trait, 792 controls without and 195 controls
with the trait (or = [50/195]/[80/792] = 2.5385).
with a sampling fraction of 1/100, there would be 79.2
unexposed and 19.5 exposed controls, and the or would
still be 2.54. this demonstrates that the actual risk or odds of
disease cannot be derived once only a sample of individuals
without disease are included, but that the ratio of exposed
over unexposed controls (195/792) remains valid whatever
the sampling fraction. this has been called the “exposure
odds”, and many prefer to write the or as the exposure odds
ratio: or = (50/80)/(195/792) = 2.54.
in a cohort study, the or can be easily recalculated into a
risk ratio (rr), since the actual risks (p0 and p1) are known
[3]: rr = or/[(1−p0) + p0*or] [3]. in the example above,
rr = 2.5385/(0.99 + 0.01*2.5385) = 2.5000.
in a case-control study, because the number of controls is
only a fraction of the actual number of individuals without
disease in the cohort, absolute risks cannot be calculated, and
a recalculation from or to rr is not possible (unless there is
external information on the absolute risks).
this implies that it is not possible to calculate from our
data how different the or was from the rr, as steinsmith
tried. we can, however, in this particular case, make an
estimate, since we know the risk of haemorrhage under
anticoagulant treatment from previous studies to be around
1% per year. with a background risk of 1% per year, all the
ors mentioned in our paper are within 2% of the relative
risk. the highest or of 2.6 (2.5641) would relate to a relative
risk of 2.5 (2.5246)—a trivial difference. steinsmith’s further
suggestions for analyses, i.e., to use likelihood ratios, are
relevant to studies of diagnostic tests in which the aim is to
