abstract
the dopamine (da) agonist 7-hydroxy-n,n-di-n-propyl-2-amino-tetralin (7-oh-dpat) has been used extensively as a tool to investigate
the role of da d3 receptors in the reinforcing and discriminative stimulus properties of psychostimulant drugs. the present study examined
the relative importance of d3 vs.  xxxg656xxx  actions in the discriminative stimulus effects of (+)-7-oh-dpat (0.03 mg/kg, sc) in 16 male
sprague ± dawley rats trained to discriminate this compound from saline in a two-lever, water-reinforced operant procedure under a fr 20
schedule. stimulus generalization and antagonism tests were conducted with cocaine and with various selective d2 and  xxxg657xxx  ligands.
in contrast to previous findings that (+)-7-oh-dpat substitutes for cocaine, the present results demonstrated that cocaine does not produce
stimulus generalization in animals trained to discriminate (+)-7-oh-dpat. although two d3-preferring agonists, pd-128907 and
pramipexole, produced complete stimulus generalization to the training drug, two highly selective d3 antagonists (pnu-99194a, pd
152255) failed to block the discriminative stimulus effects of (+)-7-oh-dpat. however, the d2 antagonist  xxxd3096xxx  (3.0 mg/kg)
produced a rightward shift in the (+)-7-oh-dpat dose ± response curve. these findings suggest that d2 receptors are critically involved in
mediating the cue properties of (+)-7-oh-dpat. however, alternative interpretations that pnu-99194a is not entirely  xxxg657xxx  selective
should also be considered. d 2001 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
recent investigations of the behavioral pharmacology of
addictive psychostimulant drugs have focused on the dopamine (da)  xxxg657xxx  (bevins et al., 1997; caine and
koob, 1995; lamas et al., 1996; spealman, 1996), a subtype
of the d2 family of da receptors (civelli et al., 1991;
sibley and monsma, 1992). this receptor subtype is localized in limbic brain regions (levesque et al., 1992), areas
well known to be involved in the reinforcing and discriminative stimulus properties of psychostimulants. increased
understanding of the role of d3 receptors in mediating the
behavioral effects of psychostimulant drugs may benefit the
development of pharmacological treatment interventions for
stimulant abuse, as well as the treatment of central nervous
system (cns) diseases involving the da system.

because of their reported selectivity for the da d3
receptor, compounds such as 7-hydroxy-n,n-di-n-propyl2-amino-tetralin (7-oh-dpat) and pd-128907 have been
used to characterize the function of this receptor subtype
(damsma et al., 1993; levesque et al., 1992; pugsley et al.,
1995). these compounds have been reported to have as
much as a 100-fold greater affinity for d3 over d2 receptors
based on in vitro binding assays (burris et al., 1995;
levesque et al., 1992; pugsley et al., 1995). however, many
of these assays utilized a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist rather than a
d2 agonist as the competitive ligand. moreover, functional
assays such as mitogenesis in chinese hamster ovary cells
indicate that the d3 selectivity of these compounds is
approximately five- to sevenfold (sautel et al., 1995). the
d3 selectivity regarding the behavioral effects of these
compounds remains speculative.
several investigations have reported either complete or
partial generalization to 7-oh-dpat and (+)-pd-128907 in
animals trained to discriminate cocaine (acri et al., 1995;
lamas et al., 1996; spealman, 1996) or d-amphetamine
(baker et al., 1998; bevins et al., 1997). based on these

findings, some investigators have concluded that d3 receptors may play an important role in the discriminative
stimulus effects of cocaine and d-amphetamine. however,
recent studies have demonstrated that the d3-preferring
antagonist, pnu-99194a fails to block the discriminative
stimulus effects of these psychostimulants (baker et al.,
1997) or the stimulus generalization produced by 7-ohdpat in rats trained to discriminate d-amphetamine or
cocaine (baker et al., 1998; garner and baker, 1999).
preliminary investigations demonstrated that pnu-99194a
only partially blocked the training dose of (+)-7-oh-dpat,
while greater antagonism was observed with the d2
antagonist  xxxd3096xxx  (baker et al., 1999). these results
question the importance of d3 receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of (+)-7-oh-dpat.
the present study further examined the antagonism of
(+)-7-oh-dpat with  xxxd3096xxx , pnu-99194a and
another d3 antagonist, pd 152255, by testing their effects
on the full dose ± response function of (+)-7-oh-dpat.
additionally, stimulus generalization was assessed with
other putative d3 agonists, (+)-pd-128907 and pramipexole, as well as with cocaine. finally, pnu-99194a was also
tested for stimulus generalization to (+)-7-oh-dpat.
2. method
2.1. subjects
sixteen male sprague ± dawley rats (harlan breeding
laboratories, indianapolis, in) aged 50 ± 60 days and
weighing 250 ± 300 g at the beginning of the study served
as subjects. the animals had no previous operant training
and were drug naive at the beginning of the present study.
animals were individually housed in plastic cages, in a
colony maintained on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on
07:00 ± 19:00 hours) and at a relatively constant temperature
(19 ± 23°c) and humidity (50 ± 60%). commercial rat feed
was freely available, and water was restricted to amounts
received during 20-min training sessions and an additional
30 min/day. free access to water was also given for 24 h
approximately every 7 days. the animals were maintained
in accordance with the general principles of animal husbandry outlined by the national institutes of health, and the
experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc) of
western michigan university.
2.2. apparatus
training and testing sessions were conducted in eight
standard operant chambers (env-001; med associates,
georgia, vt), housed in sound- and light-attenuating shells
equipped with fans to provide ventilation and masking
noise. each chamber contained an overhead 28-v house
light and a liquid reinforcer delivery mechanism (0.1 ml)

that was mounted equidistant between two removable
levers on the front panel of the chamber. a center
removable lever was located above the liquid delivery
mechanism and used only during the initial autoshaping
sessions. a zenith 320-sx microcomputer programmed
with med-pc software (version 2.0, med associates,
georgia, vt) was used to control experimental events
and data collection.
2.3. drugs
(+)-7-oh-dpat-hydrobromide, pramipexole-hydrochloride,  xxxd3096xxx -hydrochloride and pnu-99194a
were generously provided by pharmacia (kalamazoo,
mi). (+)-pd-128907-hydrochloride was purchased from
research biochemicals international (natick, ma). the
national institute on drug abuse (bethesda, md) provided
cocaine-hydrochloride and parke-davis (ann arbor, mi)
generously provided pd-152255. pnu-99194a was dissolved in sterile deionized water. pd 152255 was dissolved
in a few drops of 0.1 n hcl and diluted with deionized
water. all other drugs were dissolved in 0.9% bacteriostatic saline. all drugs were administered by subcutaneous
(sc) injection, except cocaine-hydrochloride and pd152255, which were administered by intraperitoneal (ip)
injection. injections were administered in a volume of 1
ml/kg and doses were calculated based on the salt form of
each compound.
2.4. autoshaping and errorless training procedures
sixteen subjects were run in two squads of eight in 20min training sessions 6 days a week (monday± saturday).
prior to discrimination training, lever presses were autoshaped on a single center lever under a schedule of
continuous water reinforcement. no injections were given
prior to these sessions. once lever pressing was established
in all animals, injections of either (+)-7-oh-dpat (0.03
mg/kg) or saline were administered 15 min prior to errorless training sessions. three errorless training sessions were
conducted under each stimulus condition (ssddsd) with
only the stimulus-appropriate (drug or saline) lever present.
once the animals were exposed to both stimulus conditions
under a fr 1 reinforcement schedule, the fr value was
gradually incremented both within and across training
sessions (see below).
2.5. discrimination training procedures
discrimination training began on the seventh 20-min
training session, with both levers present. injections of
either (+)-7-oh-dpat (0.03 mg/kg) or saline were administered subcutaneously 15 min prior to daily sessions. for
half the animals, left-lever responses were reinforced following saline and right-lever responses were reinforced
following drug; conditions were reversed for the remaining

a.j. christian et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 68 (2001) 371±377

animals. injections were administered in a pseudorandom
order and neither condition (drug or saline) prevailed for
more than two consecutive sessions. to reduce the influence
of olfactory stimuli on lever choice, levers were wiped with
 xxxd2400xxx  between the two squads of eight rats,
which were also frequently run in different orders (extance
and goudie, 1981).
the first training session under each stimulus condition
began on the same reinforcement schedule that was in
effect during the previous errorless training session with
that condition. the reinforcement schedule was gradually
incremented until all animals were responding reliably on
a fr 20 resetting schedule, in which 20 consecutive
correct responses were required for reinforcement and
errors reset the response counter. during initial discrimination training sessions, the fr value was gradually
incremented both within and across training sessions.
within training sessions, the fr value was programmed
to increment following the delivery of five reinforcers at
each fr value. the starting fr value at the beginning of
each session and the value of the fr increment were
determined for each individual subject based on performance during the previous training session under each
condition. once animals were reliably responding on a fr
20 schedule, this schedule remained in effect for all
subsequent training sessions. the criterion for discrimination was a minimum of 80% condition-appropriate lever
selection prior to the delivery of the first reinforcer and for
the total session for at least nine of 10 consecutive
training sessions.

of several doses of (+)-7-oh-dpat (0.01 ± 0.10 mg/kg).
pnu-99194a (10.0 mg/kg) and  xxxd3096xxx  (3.0 and 10.0
mg/kg) were also tested in combination with each of
several doses of pramipexole. each compound was tested
in a minimum of eight animals.
2.7. data analysis
dose± response data are presented as the percentage of
total responses made on the drug-appropriate lever during
test sessions. response rate is presented as the number of
responses on either lever, per second, during test sessions.
for each dose tested, the mean and standard error of the
mean were calculated for each of these dependent measures.
in the event that an animal did not complete at least 10 total
responses during a test session, the percentage of drugappropriate responses for that test was not included in the
statistical analyses. drug-lever selection that was 80% or
greater was considered evidence for stimulus generalization.
complete antagonism was defined as drug-appropriate
responding less than 20%. drug-appropriate responding

2.6. testing procedures
stimulus generalization and antagonism tests were
given after the aforementioned criteria were met. test
sessions were conducted in a similar manner to training
sessions with the exception that no reinforcers were
delivered and the animal was removed from the chamber
upon completion of 20 consecutive responses on either
lever, or when 20 min elapsed, whichever occurred first.
for each compound tested, the order of doses was
counterbalanced across subjects, and approximately half
the animals received tests after drug maintenance sessions
while the other half received tests after saline maintenance
sessions. subjects were administered at least two training
sessions between test sessions and were required to
maintain the 80% criterion under both training conditions
before each test. a dose ± response curve was determined
with the training compound in all 16 subjects (0.003 ±0.10
mg/kg). stimulus generalization tests were conducted with
several doses of (+)-pd-128907 (0.01 ± 0.30 mg/kg)
cocaine (1.5 ± 10.0 mg/kg), pramipexole (0.1 ±1.0 mg/kg)
and pnu-99194a (10.0 ±40.0 mg/kg). antagonism tests
were also administered with  xxxd3096xxx  (3.0 and 10.0
mg/kg), pnu-99194a (10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) and
pd152255 (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) in combination with each

between 20% and 80% was considered evidence for partial
substitution or partial antagonism. dose ±response curves
were also analyzed using a nonlinear regression, and ed50's
and confidence intervals were calculated. results of stimulus generalization tests were also analyzed by a one-way
analyses of variance (anovas). two-way anovas
(antagonist dose, agonist dose) were conducted on the
results of antagonism tests. statistical analyses were conducted using the software graphpad prism (version 2.0,
graphpad, san diego, ca).

3. results
(+)-7-oh-dpat readily produced discriminative stimulus control in all 16 subjects. the mean number of sessions
to criterion was 34  11.75 (range = 22 ±63; median = 28).
results of stimulus generalization tests with (+)-7-ohdpat, (+)-pd-128907, pramipexole and cocaine are
displayed in fig. 1. (+)-7-oh-dpat produced a dose-dependent increase in drug-appropriate responding with complete stimulus generalization at 0.03 and 0.10 mg/kg

combination with (+)-7-oh-dpat in animals trained to discriminate (+)-7-oh-dpat (0.03 mg/kg) from saline. the percentage of drug-lever responses is

(ed50 = 0.01 mg/kg; 95% confidence intervals: 0.008 ±
0.012 mg/kg). the percentage of drug-lever responses
was significantly different across doses ( f3,63 = 61.27,
p < .0001). response rate was also significantly reduced
by the training drug ( f3,63 = 6.27, p < .005); the response
rate following the 0.10 mg/kg dose was significantly different from the saline response rate ( p < .01).
(+)-pd 128907 produced a significant increase in
drug-appropriate responding ( f4,39 = 24.86, p < .0001)
with full substitution following a dose of 0.30 mg/kg
(ed50 = 0.08 mg/kg; 95% confidence interval = 0.04 ±
0.14). this compound also significantly disrupted responding in a dose-dependent manner ( f4,39 = 6.002,
p < .005) with a statistically significant difference between
the 0.30 mg/kg dose and saline ( p < .05). pramipexole
also produced dose-dependent increases in drug-appropriate responding, with complete substitution for (+)-7-ohdpat following the 0.30 and 1.0 mg/kg doses. response
rate was severely depressed at all doses of pramipexole
( f3,31 = 13.13, p < .0001). cocaine produced only partial
substitution for (+)-7-oh-dpat and did not produce a
statistically significant increase in drug-appropriate
responding. cocaine also did not significantly affect
response rate.
the results of antagonism tests with the d3 antagonists,
pnu-99194a and pd 152255 and the d2 antagonist,
 xxxd3096xxx  are illustrated in fig. 2. pnu-99194a (fig.
2, upper left-hand panel) failed to block the discriminative
stimulus effects of (+)-7-oh-dpat. the combination of
10.0 mg/kg pnu-99194a with (+)-7-oh-dpat did not
alter the (+)-7-oh-dpat dose ± response function. the
20.0 mg/kg dose of pnu-99194a reduced drug-appropriate responding following 0.03 and 0.10 mg/kg (+)-7oh-dpat, but not significantly. the combination of
pnu-99194a and (+)-7-oh-dpat markedly suppressed
response rate (fig. 2, lower left-hand panel). the main
effects of pnu-99194a dose ( f2,84 = 20.24, p < .0001) and
7-oh-dpat dose ( f3,84 = 8.82, p < .0001) on response
rate were statistically significant as was the interaction
( f6,84 = 2.58, p < .05).
pd 152255 (fig. 2, upper left-hand panel) also failed to
block (+)-7-oh-dpat discrimination. the 1.0 mg/kg dose
of pd 152255 actually appeared to potentiate the 0.01 mg/
kg dose of (+)-7-oh-dpat (fig. 2). the 3.0 mg/kg dose of
pd 152255 (fig. 2, lower left-hand panel) completely
disrupted responding in all rats tested, which precluded
the testing of higher doses.
 xxxd3096xxx  (fig. 2, upper right-hand panel) produced a
rightward shift in the (+)-7-oh-dpat dose ± response curve.
the ed50 of (+)-7-oh-dpat alone was 0.01 mg/kg (95%
confidence intervals = 0.01 ±0.05 mg/kg). when 3.0 mg/kg
 xxxd3096xxx  was administered in combination with (+)-7oh-dpat, the ed50 was 0.03 mg/kg (95% confidence
intervals = 0.01 ± 0.24 mg/kg).  xxxd3096xxx  10.0 mg/kg
shifted the ed50 of (+)-7-oh-dpat to 0.06 mg/kg (95%
confidence intervals = 0.01 ±0.12 mg/kg). however, because

375

the confidence intervals overlapped, these ed50s were not
significantly different.
in an effort to determine whether the combination of a d3
and a d2 antagonist would block (+)-7-oh-dpat's stimulus
effects more fully, pnu-99194a and  xxxd3096xxx  (fig. 2,
upper right-hand panel) were tested in combination with a
range of (+)-7-oh-dpat doses. as noted in fig. 2, this
combination actually produced less antagonism than  xxxd3096xxx  alone.
fig. 3 illustrates the results of antagonism tests with
pnu-99194a and  xxxd3096xxx  administered in combination
with pramipexole. pnu-99194a failed to block the stimulus
generalization produced by pramipexole.  xxxd3096xxx 
shifted the pramipexole dose ± response curve to the right
and significantly attenuated the response rate suppression
produced by pramipexole ( f2,84 = 4.83, p < .05).
because pnu-99194a (20.0 mg/kg) appeared to produce partial substitution when tested in combination with
vehicle, pnu-99194a (5.0 ± 40.0 mg/kg) was subsequently
tested for stimulus generalization. again, partial substitution for the training drug was observed with pnu-99194a
(see fig. 1).

4. discussion
the results of the present study support previous findings
that discriminative stimulus control is readily established in
rats by 7-oh-dpat (depoortere et al., 2000; mcelroy,
1994; sanger and depoortere, 1997; varty and higgins,
1997) or its (+)-isomer (baker et al., 1999). previous studies
have indicated a potential modulatory role of the  xxxg657xxx 
subtype in the stimulus effects of 7-oh-dpat (bevins et al.,
1997; sanger and depoortere, 1997; varty and higgins,
1997). specifically, the potencies of cue substitution by
several da agonists were more strongly correlated with d3
than d2 in vitro potencies (sanger and depoortere, 1997). a
study by varty and higgins (1997) supports the results of
sanger and depoortere (1997) with evidence for  xxxg657xxx 
mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of 7-ohdpat. their data suggest that the pharmacological profile of
the various dopaminergic compounds that substitute for the
7-oh-dpat cue was more consistent with d3 than d2
receptor interactions. however, these conclusions are based
on the use of agonists with only moderate selectivity for the
 xxxg657xxx . demonstrations that selective d3 antagonists
block the discriminative stimulus effects of 7-oh-dpat are
required to confirm these tentative conclusions.
bevins et al. (1997) reported a rightward shift in the 7oh-dpat dose± response curve with eticlopride pretreatment (0.01, 0.05 mg/kg) in animals trained to discriminate
d-amphetamine. however, because eticlopride is a d2/d3
antagonist, these results did not clearly distinguish the
relative importance of d3 vs. d2 receptors in 7-oh-dpat's
substitution for d-amphetamine. indeed, the putative d3
antagonist, pnu-99194a did not block stimulus generalization produced by (+)-7-oh-dpat or 7-oh-dpat in rats
trained to discriminate d-amphetamine or cocaine (baker et
al., 1998; garner and baker, 1999).
in animals trained to discriminate (+)-7-oh-dpat, preliminary findings from our laboratory indicated that pnu99194a only partially attenuated discrimination of the
training dose (baker et al., 1999). moreover, a highly
selective d2 agonist, pnu-91356a, produced complete
generalization to (+)-7-oh-dpat (baker et al., 1999). the
present study expanded these preliminary findings by assessing the effects of pnu-99194a and another d3 selective
antagonist pd 152255 on a range of (+)-7-oh-dpat doses
(0.01 ±0.10 mg/kg). neither of these compounds shifted the
(+)-7-oh-dpat dose ± response curve to the right. in fact,
pd 152255 (1.0 mg/kg) appeared to potentiate a low dose of
(+)-7-oh-dpat (0.01 mg/kg). it is also of interest to note
that the combined administration of  xxxd3096xxx  (3.0 mg/
kg) and pnu-99194a (10.0 mg/kg) actually produced less
antagonism of (+)-7-oh-dpat than did  xxxd3096xxx  alone.
perhaps this is due to some pharmacokinetic interaction
between pnu-99194a and  xxxd3096xxx  that decreases the
bioavailability of  xxxd3096xxx . alternatively, these findings
could be interpreted as potentiation of (+)-7-oh-dpat by
pnu-99194a. consistent with this notion is the observation

that pnu-99194a actually produced partial substitution for
(+)-7-oh-dpat (see fig. 1). in fact, while the present study
was in progress, depoortere et al. (2000) reported that pnu99194a failed to block the discrimination of racemic 7-ohdpat and actually potentiated the discriminative cue produced by this compound. however, the present study did
not show as great a potentiation by pnu-99194a as that
demonstrated by depoortere et al. (2000), which may be due
to differences in the training drug or other methodological
variables. nonetheless, the present results are consistent
with those of depoortere et al. (2000) regarding the lack
of 7-oh-dpat antagonism observed with pnu-99194a.
there are several possible interpretations of these results.
one interpretation is that  xxxg657xxx  actions are not
important in mediating the discriminative stimulus effects
of 7-oh-dpat, and  xxxg656xxx  actions are more critically
involved in these effects. this interpretation is supported by
previous findings that the highly selective d2 agonist pnu91356 exhibited complete stimulus generalization to (+)-7oh-dpat (baker et al., 1999) and by the present findings
that the d2 antagonist,  xxxd3096xxx  produced a rightward
shift in the (+)-7-oh-dpat dose ± response curve. however,
the ed50 confidence intervals (with and without  xxxd3096xxx ) overlapped and a higher dose of  xxxd3096xxx  did not
further shift the dose ± response curve. thus, the discriminative stimulus effects may also not be solely mediated by
d2 receptors. in fact, two other moderately selective d3
agonists, (+)-pd-128907 and pramipexole exhibited stimulus generalization in a similar manner to the d2 agonist
pnu-91356. it is also possible that the attenuation of (+)-7oh-dpat by  xxxd3096xxx  is not solely due to  xxxg656xxx 
antagonism. although  xxxd3096xxx  is reported to have a
much greater affinity for d2 receptors than d3 receptors,
there are several metabolites of  xxxd3096xxx  that exhibit a
relatively high affinity for d3 receptors in the rat (mohell et
al., 1993). it is possible that one or more of these metabolites contributed to the antagonism of (+)-7-oh-dpat's
discriminative stimulus effects.
another possible interpretation of the present data and
those of depoortere et al. (2000) is that pnu-99194a is not
a selective d3 antagonist, but is acting through some other
mechanism. results of recent investigations in our laboratory support this hypothesis. in rats trained to discriminate
pnu-99194a, pd 152255 fails to produce generalization,
whereas the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, and the antimuscarinic compounds scopolamine and trihexyphenidyl do
substitute for pnu-99194a (unpublished findings).
in summary, the present study attempted to delineate the
relative importance of d3 vs.  xxxg656xxx  mediation of (+)7-oh-dpat's discriminative stimulus effects by comparing
the effects of putative d3 antagonists with that of a fairly
selective d2 antagonist on the (+)-7-oh-dpat dose ±
response function. while the results suggest that the (+)-7oh-dpat cue is attenuated to a greater extent by d2
receptor blockade, these results are still somewhat open to
interpretation. however, it is at least clear that the discrimi-

nation of this compound is not based on a nonselective
dopaminergic cue, because cocaine (present results) and damphetamine (baker et al., 1999) both fail to substitute for
(+)-7-oh-dpat.
finally, recent research using moderately selective d3
receptor ligands have led to tentative conclusions regarding
the functional importance of this receptor subtype. clinical
implications of this research are of considerable importance,
as behavioral pharmacology research with  xxxg657xxx 
ligands may impact the development of more effective
treatments for a variety of cns diseases, such as parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and psychostimulant addiction. results of recent studies using 7-oh-dpat and
similar compounds should be considered cautiously until
more selective  xxxg657xxx  ligands become readily available
for investigation.
