inhibitory effects of human and porcine alpha-amylase on cck-8-stimulated lipase secretion of isolated rat pancreatic acini.  previously we have demonstrated inhibitory effects of the plant lectin wheat germ agglutinin (wga) on (125)i-cck-8 binding to pancreatic ar42j cells as well as on cck-8-stimulated ca(2+) release and alpha-amylase secretion of rat pancreatic acini or acinar cells. therefore, it is entirely conceivable that alpha-amylase having several lectin-like carbohydrate recognition domains can modulate the cck-8 stimulated lipase secretion. human alpha-amylase, purified from pancreatic juice by affinity chromatography to homogeneity, and commercial porcine  xxxg158xxx  inhibit cck-8-stimulated lipase secretion of rat pancreatic acini in a concentration-dependent manner. acarbose, a specific inhibitor of alpha-amylase, was without effect on cck-8-induced cellular lipase secretion. the data presented here provide evidence for a regulatory function of alpha-amylase in cck-8-stimulated pancreatic secretion.
