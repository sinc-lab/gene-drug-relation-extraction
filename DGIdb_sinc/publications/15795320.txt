abstract
gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx  are effective agents in the treatment of non–small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), and the present
study investigates cellular and genetic aspects of their interaction against a549, calu-1, and calu-6 cells. cells were treated
with  xxxd2868xxx  and gemcitabine, and their interaction was
assessed using the combination index. the role of drug metabolism in gemcitabine cytotoxicity was examined with inhibitors of  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ), 5⬘-nucleotidase, and  xxxg400xxx , whereas the role of  xxxd2868xxx  targets,
 xxxg2366xxx  (ts),  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr), and
 xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide formyltransferase (garft) in drug
chemosensitivity was analyzed in cytotoxicity rescue studies.
the effect of gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx  on akt phosphorylation was investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was
used to study target gene-expression profiles and its modula-

despite recent advances in early diagnosis and treatment,
non–small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) is a disease with a grim
prognosis. extensive clinical studies demonstrated that chem.d.t. was supported by unrestricted research grants from eli lilly (florence, italy). r.d. was supported by research grants from the ministero

tion by each drug. synergistic cytotoxicity was demonstrated,
and  xxxd2868xxx  significantly decreased the amount of phosphorylated akt, enhanced apoptosis, and increased the expression of  xxxg611xxx  in a549 and calu-6 cells, as well as the expression
of the human nucleoside equilibrative transporter 1 (hent1) in
all cell lines. pcr demonstrated a correlation between  xxxg611xxx 
expression and gemcitabine sensitivity, whereas expression of
ts, dhfr, and garft was predictive of  xxxd2868xxx  chemosensitivity. these data demonstrated that 1) gemcitabine and
 xxxd2868xxx  synergistically interact against nsclc cells
through the suppression of akt phosphorylation and induction
of apoptosis; 2) the gene expression profile of critical genes
may predict for drug chemosensitivity; and 3)  xxxd2868xxx  enhances  xxxg611xxx  and hent1 expression, thus suggesting the role of
gene-expression modulation for rational development of chemotherapy combinations.

motherapy increases survival in the adjuvant setting (arriagada et al., 2004) and in patients with advanced disease
(reck and gatzemeier, 2004). nonetheless, response rates
remain lower than 15%, and median survival is less than 6
months, thus emphasizing the need for new effective drugs
and combination regimens (rosell and crinò, 2002). however, the rationale for chemotherapy combinations has remained mostly empirical, determined from the antitumor
activity of each agent and the lack of overlapping toxicities,
despite many attempts to discover preclinical models for
rational selection of drug interactions.

 xxxd2868xxx -gemcitabine interaction in lung cancer cells

materials and methods
drugs and chemicals. gemcitabine,  xxxd2868xxx , and ly309887
were generous gifts from eli lilly & co. (indianapolis, in). drugs
were dissolved in sterile distilled water and diluted in culture me-

dium immediately before use. rpmi 1640, mccoy’s, and minimal
essential medium, fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin
(50 iu/ml), and streptomycin (50 ␮g/ml) were from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). all other chemicals were from sigma-aldrich (st. louis,
mo).
cell culture. the nsclc cell line a549 (adenocarcinoma) was
obtained from american type culture collection (manassas, va),
and calu-1 (epidermoid carcinoma) and calu-6 (anaplastic carcinoma) cell lines were generously provided by professor f. basolo
(university of pisa, pisa, italy). cells were maintained as monolayer
cultures, respectively, in rpmi, mccoy’s, and minimal essential
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillinstreptomycin. cells were cultivated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks
(costar, cambridge, ma) at 37°c in 5% co2 and 95% air and were
harvested with trypsin/edta when they were in logarithmic growth.
assay of cytotoxicity. cells were plated in 24-well sterile plastic
plates (costar) at 5 ⫻ 104 cells/well and were allowed to attach for
24 h. cells were treated with 1) gemcitabine 0.1 ng/ml (0.33 nm) to
100 ␮g/ml (333 ␮m) for 1 h; 2)  xxxd2868xxx  0.1 ng/ml (0.21 nm) to 100
␮g/ml (212 ␮m) for 24 h; 3) gemcitabine for 1 h, followed by a 24-h
washout in drug-free medium and then  xxxd2868xxx  for 24 h; and 4)
 xxxd2868xxx  for 24 h followed by a 24-h washout in drug-free medium
and then gemcitabine for 1 h. the experimental conditions adopted
in this study, including gemcitabine concentrations and time of exposure, are similar to those selected in previous studies (tonkinson
et al., 1999; giovannetti et al., 2004). moreover, the effects of gemcitabine on deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool depletion occur during
the first 30 min and reach the maximum effect within 2 h (symon et
al., 2002). cytotoxicity was determined after 1 h of treatment with
gemcitabine and 24 h of incubation with  xxxd2868xxx  using concentrations that are comparable with the drug exposure observed in the
clinical setting (noble and goa, 1997; thödtmann et al., 1999). after
drug treatments were completed, cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in drug-free medium, and the growth inhibition by drugs
was assessed by counting cells. the ic50 values relative to untreated
cultures were calculated by nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting.
drug interaction between gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx  was assessed at a fixed concentration ratio using the combination index,
where ci ⬍ 1, ci ⫽ 1, and ci ⬎ 1 indicate synergistic, additive, and
antagonistic effects, respectively (chou et al., 1994). data analysis
was performed with the use of calcusyn software (biosoft, oxford,
uk).
modulation of gemcitabine metabolism and cytotoxicity.
cells were plated in 24-well plates as described under “assay of
cytotoxicity” and were treated with gemcitabine 0.1 ng/ml (0.33 nm)
to 10 ␮g/ml (33 ␮m) for 24 h alone or in combination with 10 ␮m
2⬘- xxxd1836xxx , diethylpyrocarbonate, and  xxxd3335xxx  to inhibit drug activation by phosphorylation (eda et al., 1998) or drug
inactivation by dephosphorylation (hicks-berger et al., 2001) and
deamination (eda et al., 1998), respectively. ic50 values were calculated as described above.
rescue studies of  xxxd2868xxx  cytotoxicity. to gain further
insight into the mechanism of action of  xxxd2868xxx , cells were plated
in 24-well plates as described under “assay of cytotoxicity”, treated
with  xxxd2868xxx  0.1 ng/ml (0.21 nm) to 100 ␮g/ml (212 ␮m) for 24 h,
and rescued by simultaneous supplementation of thymidine (5 ␮m)
and hypoxanthine (100 ␮m), with the end products of the enzymatic
steps inhibited by  xxxd2868xxx . moreover, rescue experiments with
thymidine and hypoxanthine were performed with the selective ts
inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (0.1 ng/ml to 100 ␮g/ml) and the garftselective inhibitor ly309887 (0.1 ng/ml to 100 ␮g/ml).
cell-cycle analysis. cells were plated at 1 ⫻ 106 in 100-mm
plastic dishes (costar) and were allowed to attach for 24 h. after
treatment with gemcitabine (1 h),  xxxd2868xxx  (24 h), and their
combinations at their ic50 levels followed by a 24-h washout, cells
were harvested with trypsin/edta and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). dna was stained with a solution containing  xxxd3027xxx  (25 ␮g/ml), rnase (1 mg/ml), and nonidet

now an established, effective agent in the treatment of malignancies, particularly nsclc and pancreatic cancer (noble
and goa, 1997; li et al., 2004). gemcitabine is a prodrug that
is transported into the cell mostly by human equilibrative
nucleoside transporter 1 (hent1) and then requires intracellular phosphorylation to its active metabolite, 2⬘,2⬘-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate, to be incorporated into dna,
leading to chain termination (bergman et al., 2002).
the rate-limiting step in the activation of the drug is
catalyzed by  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ), whereas 5⬘-nucleotidase (5⬘-nt) and  xxxg400xxx  (cda) are the main
inactivating enzymes (galmarini et al., 2001). in addition to
being incorporated into dna, gemcitabine exerts its cytotoxicity by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (rr); therefore, a
mechanism for gemcitabine resistance, other than decreased
activity of  xxxg611xxx  and enhanced activity of 5⬘-nt and cda,
could be a mutation or overexpression of rr (bergman et al.,
2002).
antimetabolites are widely used in combination regimens
because of their ability to biochemically modulate the cytotoxicity of other drugs (peters et al., 2000). in particular,
preclinical studies on gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin (van moorsel et al., 1999), carboplatin, or paclitaxel
(theodossiou et al., 1998; edelman et al., 2001) and  xxxd3401xxx  (tolis et al., 1999) have shown schedule-dependent drug
interaction in several human lung cancer cell lines.
 xxxd2868xxx  is an antifolate inhibitor of thymidilate synthase (ts),  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr), and  xxxd149xxx 
ribonucleotide formyltransferase (garft), with activity
against a wide spectrum of tumor cell lines, including
nsclc (britten et al., 1999; teicher et al., 2000). preclinical
studies suggested that the combinations of  xxxd2868xxx  with
cisplatin, as well as taxanes and gemcitabine, produce additive or synergistic cytotoxicity (teicher et al., 1999, 2000;
tonkinson et al., 1999), whereas clinical trials showed response rates of 20% with single-agent  xxxd2868xxx  and of
approximately 40% in combination with cisplatin (rusthoven
et al., 1999; manegold et al., 2000; shepherd et al., 2001).
moreover, the results of a large prospective randomized
study comparing  xxxd2868xxx  with docetaxel in the secondline treatment of 571 patients with advanced nsclc indicated similar response rates (9.1 versus 8.8%) and median
survival outcome (7.9 versus 8.5 months) for the two agents
with toxicity profiles favoring  xxxd2868xxx  (hanna et al.,
2004). the ability of  xxxd2868xxx  to deplete cellular nucleotide pools, modulate cell cycle, and induce apoptosis makes
this drug a new, attractive cytotoxic agent for polychemotherapy regimens (shih et al., 1997; tonkinson et al., 1997).
in particular, dctp depletion and garft inhibition by  xxxd2868xxx  may enhance the expression of the key genes hent1
and  xxxg611xxx  as a compensatory mechanism, thus potentially
favoring gemcitabine activity. for these reasons, the present
study was performed in nsclc cell lines to investigate the
ability of the drugs to synergistically interact and to establish
a correlation between cytotoxicity and gene expression of
selected genes.

systems, foster city, ca). qrt-pcr reactions were performed in
triplicate using 5 ␮l of cdna, 12.5 ␮l of taqman universal pcr
master mix, 2.5 ␮l of probe, and 2.5 ␮l of forward and reverse
primers in a final volume of 25 ␮l. samples were amplified using the
following thermal profile: an initial incubation at 50°c for 5 min
followed by incubation at 95°c for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturation
at 95°c for 15 s, followed by annealing and extension at 60°c for 1
min.
forward and reverse primers and probes were designed with
primer express 2.0 (applied biosystems) on the basis of  xxxg611xxx , 5⬘-nt,
cda, ts, dhfr, and garft gene sequence obtained from the
genebank, whereas primers and probes for the regulatory ( xxxg1991xxx )
and catalytic subunits ( xxxg1992xxx ) of rr and for hent1 were obtained
from applied biosystems assay-on-demand gene expression products (hs00168784, hs0035724, and hs00191940). amplifications
were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
( xxxg861xxx ), and quantification of gene expression in treated cells was
performed using the ⌬⌬ct calculation, where ct is the threshold
cycle; the amount of target gene, normalized to  xxxg861xxx  and relative
to the calibrator (untreated control cells), is given as 2⫺⌬⌬ct.
preliminary experiments were carried out with dilutions of cdna
obtained from quantitative pcr human reference total rna
(stratagene, la jolla, ca) to determine the primer concentrations
that give the minimum standard deviation between ct values and to
demonstrate that the efficiencies of amplification of the target ( xxxg611xxx ,
5⬘-nt, cda,  xxxg1991xxx ,  xxxg1992xxx , ts, dhfr, and garft) and reference
( xxxg861xxx ) genes are approximately equal. the absolute value of the
slope of standard cdna concentration versus ct were ⫺3.06 ( xxxg611xxx ),
⫺3.04 (5⬘-nt), ⫺3.52 (cda), ⫺3.12 ( xxxg1991xxx ), ⫺3.24 ( xxxg1992xxx ), ⫺2.98
(hent1), ⫺4.00 (ts), ⫺3.23 (dhfr), ⫺2.94 (garft), and ⫺3.32
( xxxg861xxx ); thus, the pcr efficiency was better than 88%.
statistical analysis. all experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. data were expressed as
mean values ⫾ s.e. and were analyzed by student’s t test or analysis
of variance followed by the tukey’s multiple comparisons; the level of
significance was set at p ⬍ 0.05.

(calu-6), respectively. on the basis of these results, combination studies were performed at fixed concentration ratios
(1:2, 1:3, and 1:6 for gemcitabine/ xxxd2868xxx ) in a549,
calu-6, and calu-1 cells, respectively. the sequential exposure of cell lines to  xxxd2868xxx  followed by gemcitabine reduced the ic50 values of gemcitabine to 3.5 ⫾ 1.0, 130.5 ⫾

levels between 0.25 and 0.75, both schedules of gemcitabine
and  xxxd2868xxx  demonstrated synergism in all cell lines;
however, although the differences were not marked, the sequence of pemetrexed3gemcitabine proved to be the most
effective against a549 and calu-6 cells (fig. 2).

ca), and data analysis was carried out with cellquest software,
whereas cell-cycle distribution was determined using modfit software (verity software house, topsham, me).
analysis of apoptosis. cells were treated with gemcitabine,
 xxxd2868xxx , and their combinations at their ic50 levels as described
under “assay of cytotoxicity”. at the end of incubation, cells were
washed twice with pbs and fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde
for 15 min. cells were resuspended and incubated for a further 15
min in a solution containing 8 ␮g/ml bisbenzimide hcl. cells were
spotted on glass slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy
(leica, wetzlar, germany). a total of 200 cells from randomly chosen
microscopic fields were counted, and the percentage of cells displaying chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation relative to
the total number of counted cells (apoptotic index) was calculated.
apoptosis induced by gemcitabine,  xxxd2868xxx , and their combinations was also studied by flow cytometry. cells treated as described under “cell-cycle analysis” were collected, washed twice
with pbs, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. fixed cells
were washed with pbs, resuspended in 0.2 m phosphate-citrate
buffer at ph 7.8, and then stained with  xxxd3027xxx  as described previously. the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified
from the sub-g1 signal, measured with the modfit software.
assay of akt phosphorylation. akt protein activation by phosphorylation after gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx  treatment was assayed with an elisa specific for p-ser473 akt and normalized to the
total akt content (biosource international, camarillo, ca). cells
were treated as described above for apoptosis analysis. at the end of
incubation, cells were washed twice with pbs, harvested by centrifugation (1000g for 5 min at 4°c), and resuspended in 25 ␮l of
extraction buffer for 30 min on ice while vortexing. a volume of 5 ␮l
of cell extract was diluted to 100 ␮l with 15 mm nan3, centrifuged at
15,000g for 10 min at 4°c, and transferred to microtiter plates coated
with a monoclonal antibody specific for total akt. a standard curve
was run with each assay using 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, and 1.6
u/ml phosphorylated full-length human recombinant akt (p-ser473
akt) and 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, and 0.3 ng/ml human recombinant
total akt. after overnight incubation at 4°c, the solution was aspirated from wells, and 100 ␮l of rabbit anti-p-ser473 akt and biotinconjugated anti-total akt was added into each well of p-ser473 akt
and akt total elisa, respectively. plates were incubated at room
temperature for 1 h, washed four times, and 100 ␮l of a working
solution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit igg and horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin was added into each well of
p-ser473 akt and total akt elisa assay, respectively. after 30 min,
a chromogen solution was added; 20 min later, the reactions were
stopped with 100 ␮l of a stop solution, and the absorbance was read
at 450 nm at 20-min intervals for 120 min to construct a plot of
absorbance increase as a function of time. to calculate p-ser473 akt
and akt total concentrations, a standard curve method was used.
values of p-ser473 akt, calculated from the standard curve, were
then normalized for total akt and protein content.
qrt-pcr analysis. to establish a correlation between drug
effect and modulation of gene expression, drug concentrations corresponding to the ic25, ic50, and ic75 values of gemcitabine,  xxxd2868xxx , and their combinations were studied. moreover, to evaluate
the time-course modulation of gene expression, qrt-pcr analysis
was performed 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after completion of drug treatment.
total rna was extracted from cells using the tri reagent ls
(sigma-aldrich). rna was dissolved in 10 mm dithiothreitol and 200

calu-6 cells, flow-cytometry studies demonstrated that  xxxd2868xxx  and gemcitabine blocked cells in the g1-s boundary.
in particular,  xxxd2868xxx  caused a 1.5-fold increase in the
population of cells in the g1 phase, from 50.5 to 74.2%. the
g1 arrest was overcome by gemcitabine, and cell-cycle distribution analysis of drug combinations demonstrated that both
schedules enhanced the percentage of cells in s and g2
phases in all cell lines (table 3).

decrease in ic50 values by inhibition of 5⬘-nt and cda
(table 1), suggesting that inactivating enzymes may play an
additional role in modulating gemcitabine cytotoxicity.
rescue studies of  xxxd2868xxx  cytotoxicity. thymidine completely reversed the cytotoxicity of the ts inhibitor
5-fluorouracil in all cell lines, whereas it partially prevented
the inhibition of cell growth by  xxxd2868xxx , as demonstrated
by a 1.2- to 3.4-fold increase in the ic50 value (table 2).
similar results were obtained with hypoxanthine that, alone,
reduced the cytotoxicity of ly309887, although it was less
effective with  xxxd2868xxx  (table 2). however, only the combination of thymidine and hypoxanthine totally protected
cells from the antiproliferative effect of  xxxd2868xxx  (table 2).
cell-cycle effects of gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx .
both  xxxd2868xxx  and gemcitabine were able to affect the cell
cycle of nsclc cells (table 3). in particular, the percentage
of a549 cells in the s phase significantly increased from 6.0
to 32.5% (p ⬍ 0.05), after treatment with  xxxd2868xxx  for
24 h, whereas a modest increase was detected in calu-1 cells
(from 25.6 to 38.2%, p ⫽ not significant). the same effect on
cell cycle was observed after a 1-h treatment with gemcitabine in a549 cells (from 6.0 to 18.0%, p ⬍ 0.05) and calu-1
cells (from 25.7 to 30.7%, p ⫽ not significant). in contrast, in

inhibition of akt phosphorylation. gemcitabine and
 xxxd2868xxx  were able to significantly reduce the amount of
phosphorylated akt in a549 and calu-6 cells (p ⬍ 0.05), with
 xxxd2868xxx  being more potent than gemcitabine. in calu-1
cells, the amount of the phosphorylated form of akt was
decreased up to ⫺31.5% by  xxxd2868xxx  and up to ⫺22.2% by
gemcitabine compared with controls (fig. 4).
correlation between gene expression and chemosensitivity. the relative expression of  xxxg611xxx  was remarkably higher than 5⬘-nt, cda,  xxxg1991xxx ,  xxxg1992xxx , and hent1
in all cell lines (table 4). the sensitivity of a549 cells to
gemcitabine was correlated with low expression of
 xxxg1991xxx /m2 and high expression of  xxxg611xxx  and hent1,
whereas the lower chemosensitivity of calu-1 cells seemed
mostly dependent on high expression of the gene encoding
the inactivating enzymes cda and 5⬘-nt (table 4). a
similar correlation was found between the ic50 values of
 xxxd2868xxx  and the expression of target enzymes ts,
dhfr, and garft; the least sensitive cell line (calu-1)
was found to overexpress ts, dhfr, and garft with
respect to the other cell lines (table 4).
modulation of  xxxg611xxx  and hent1 gene expression.
 xxxd2868xxx , at its ic50 and ic75 levels, significantly increased hent1 expression in all cell lines, whereas at the
ic25 level, there was only a minimal enhancement of
hent1 expression in a549 cells (fig. 5). similar results
were observed at a  xxxd2868xxx  concentration corresponding to ic50 and ic75 levels for  xxxg611xxx , whose expression was
increased by  xxxd2868xxx  up to ⫹92.40 and ⫹83.61% (a549

tion, and rupture of cells into debris after a 24-h washout. in
all cell lines, 5 to 7% of apoptotic cells were observed after
 xxxd2868xxx  treatment, whereas gemcitabine exposure was
associated with a higher percentage (8–12%) of apoptotic
cells; in each case, the drug combinations significantly
increased the apoptotic index with respect to control cells
(fig. 3). in particular, the sequential administration of
pemetrexed3gemcitabine produced the highest apoptotic index compared with gemcitabine in a549 and calu-6 cells
(12.2 ⫾ 0.6 and 8.61 ⫾ 1.6% versus 22.2 ⫾ 5.4 and 16.5 ⫾
4.9%, respectively), whereas calu-1 cells were the least sensitive, and both sequences were equivalent (9.6 ⫾ 1.2 versus
10.8 ⫾ 1.1 and 9.8 ⫾ 1.6%) (fig. 3).
these results were confirmed by the enhancement of the
sub-g1 region on the dna content histograms demonstrating
that, after drug treatments, cell-cycle modulation was accompanied by the induction of apoptosis. the a549 cells treated
with the sequential administration of pemetrexed3gemcitabine exhibited the largest sub-g1 signal (25.2%), whereas
a minor increase in the proportion of hypodyploid cells with
respect to controls was observed in calu-1 cells after  xxxd2868xxx  exposure (table 3).

⫹23.8% enhancement at ic75. furthermore, each drug
combination at the ic50 level, using the fixed combination
ratios in which gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx  are equipotent, induced both hent1 and  xxxg611xxx  expression in all cell
lines, whereas at 0.25 effect levels,  xxxg611xxx  gene expression
was not significantly modulated in calu-6 and calu-1 cells
(table 5). finally, table 6 shows the expression levels of
 xxxg611xxx  and hent1 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the end of
 xxxd2868xxx  treatment, demonstrating that their up-regulation occurred mostly between the 12- and 48-h time
points.

the present study demonstrates that gemcitabine and
 xxxd2868xxx  are synergistic against nsclc cell lines a549,
calu-6, and calu-1. these findings are novel because in
preclinical studies, the combination of  xxxd2868xxx  and gemcitabine yielded conflicting results. a recent study on colorectal cancer cell lines showed a synergistic cytotoxicity of
gemcitabine followed by  xxxd2868xxx  in hct-8 cells (adjei et
al., 2000), and similar results were obtained in lovo, widr,
and lrwz cells, whereas the sequence pemetrexed3
gemcitabine caused an additive-synergistic effect (tesei et
al., 2002). on the contrary, other studies demonstrated that
the schedule-dependent synergism was maximal when  xxxd2868xxx  preceded gemcitabine in ht29 colon cancer cells
(tonkinson et al., 1999) and in mia paca-2, panc-1, and
capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells (giovannetti et al., 2004).
because of the inherent limitations of translating in vitro
data to in vivo models, because of the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic complexity of living systems, in vivo studies were performed to test the reproducibility of drug effects.
indeed, the combination of these two drugs also showed a
schedule-dependent interaction in vivo. an additive cytotoxic
activity with both the sequence gemcitabine3pemetrexed
and the simultaneous administration was demonstrated in
h460 nsclc xenograft (teicher et al., 2000), whereas a
synergistic interaction of sequential administration of  xxxd2868xxx  followed by gemcitabine was shown in ht29 xenograft. thus, the synergistic activity of these agents in cell
culture translated into enhanced antitumor activity in vivo
(tonkinson et al., 1999). the evidence of preclinical sequence-dependent synergism prompted a three-arm randomized phase ii study of  xxxd2868xxx  plus gemcitabine as frontline therapy for advanced nsclc, and preliminary efficacy
and toxicity data indicated that  xxxd2868xxx  followed by gemcitabine on day 1 was the optimal schedule (adjei et al.,
2004).
recent studies have shown the importance of modulating
cell cycle to exploit the effect of drug combinations (peters et
al., 2000). in the present study, flow cytometry demonstrated
that in a549 and calu-1 cells,  xxxd2868xxx  and gemcitabine
caused an accumulation of cells in the s phase as a result of
the inhibition of dna synthesis. this finding is in agreement
with previous data obtained in a549 cells treated with gemcitabine (bandala et al., 2001) and in ccrf-cem and ht29
cells, which were synchronized after a 24-h  xxxd2868xxx  exposure (tonkinson et al., 1997, 1999). because gemcitabine is

116

giovannetti et al.

an s-phase–specific drug, the increase of activity of the
schedule pemetrexed3gemcitabine may be the result of a
modulation of cell cycle, potentially facilitating 2⬘,2⬘-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate incorporation into dna.
the triggering of apoptotic machinery may be crucial to
improve the therapeutic activity of gemcitabine. although
the cell-killing mechanisms of gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx 
against nsclc cells are not fully characterized, apoptosis
does indeed play a role in cell death by both agents (tonkinson et al., 1997; tolis et al., 1999; bandala et al., 2001). in the
present in vitro study, a549, calu-1, and calu-6 cells were
exposed to gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx  in combination, and
an enhancement of apoptosis was observed in treated cells
compared with controls and cells treated with single agents.
a similar observation has been reported in widr colon cancer
cells and in pancreatic cancer cells, in which a few apoptotic

cells were observed after gemcitabine treatment, whereas a
significantly higher percentage was found after treatment
with the gemcitabine- xxxd2868xxx  combination (tesei et al.,
2002; giovannetti et al., 2004). moreover, a recent investigation showed that the reduction of phosphorylated protein
kinase b/akt correlated with the enhancement of gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and antitumor activity, suggesting
that the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/akt pathway plays a
significant role in mediating drug resistance in human cancer cells (ng et al., 2001). our study demonstrates for the
first time that gemcitabine and, more effectively,  xxxd2868xxx 
decreased the amount of the activated form of akt; thus, the
reciprocal improvement of their therapeutic potential may
depend on drug-induced apoptosis.
like other nucleoside analogs, gemcitabine is hydrophilic,
and it is transported into the cell by concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside carriers. in particular, gemcitabine is
most efficiently transported by hent1, and activity of this
protein is considered to be a possible determinant of drug
efficacy (mackey et al., 1998). because ts inhibitors upregulate hent1 and increase gemcitabine sensitivity by depleting intracellular nucleotide pools (pressacco et al., 1995;
rauchwerger et al., 2000), the present study analyzed the
modulation of hent1 expression by  xxxd2868xxx  and demonstrated a significant up-regulation of this carrier, potentially
facilitating gemcitabine cytotoxicity.
several studies have suggested that  xxxg611xxx , a key enzyme of
the nucleoside salvage pathway, is a limiting factor for the
antitumor effect of gemcitabine because its deficiency is critically involved in acquired resistance to nucleoside analogs in
vitro; indeed, the sensitivity to these drugs in general and to
gemcitabine in particular was restored by transfection with
wild-type  xxxg611xxx  (blackstock et al., 2001; bergman et al., 2002).
moreover, the pretreatment  xxxg611xxx  expression level could be
used as a predictive parameter of tumor sensitivity. recent
data showed a clear correlation between  xxxg611xxx  activity and
gemcitabine sensitivity in human tumor xenografts (kroep et
al., 2002). the crucial role of  xxxg611xxx  was confirmed in the
present work by the marked reduction of gemcitabine activity with 2⬘- xxxd1836xxx , whereas transcriptome analysis
suggested the predictive value of expression of  xxxg611xxx  in particular and also of rr, 5⬘-nt, and cda. as reported previously in colon cancer cells, a similar correlation was found
between ts and chemoresistance to  xxxd2868xxx  (sigmond et
al., 2003). moreover, cytotoxicity rescue experiments suggested that purine de novo biosynthetic pathway is an important target for  xxxd2868xxx  in addition to ts, and the
analysis of gene expression of dhfr and garft demonstrated that their expression levels were related to ic50 values of  xxxd2868xxx  in the nsclc cell lines examined in the
present study.
being an inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis, because
of the blockade of the key enzyme garft (shih et al., 1997),
 xxxd2868xxx  may increase the expression of  xxxg611xxx  as a compensatory mechanism. the present study confirms this hypothesis in a549 and calu-6 cells, in which the highest synergism was observed with the sequence of pemetrexed3
gemcitabine, whereas in calu-1 cells,  xxxg611xxx  gene expression
was not apparently modulated, possibly because of higher
levels of target enzymes of  xxxd2868xxx  and the need for
higher concentrations of the drug to up-regulate  xxxg611xxx , as
demonstrated with the exposure to the ic75 level. this result

 xxxd2868xxx -gemcitabine interaction in lung cancer cells

assessment of tumor-cell response to gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx . in particular, a549 sensitivity could be explained by
the favorable  xxxg611xxx /rr ratio, as shown in pancreatic cancer
cell lines (giovannetti et al., 2004), particularly for the low
levels of the target rr, as well as of ts, dhfr, and garft,
whereas the lower sensitivity of calu-1 cells could be dependent on increased activity of the gemcitabine catabolic pathway and high levels of  xxxd2868xxx  targets. moreover, enhancement of hent1 and  xxxg611xxx  expression by  xxxd2868xxx 
could be responsible, at least in part, for the synergistic
interaction obtained with the sequential exposure to gemcitabine in nsclc cell lines, thus underlying the importance of
modulation of gene expression for rational development of
cytotoxic drug combinations.
in conclusion, several factors involving the modulation of
cell cycle, the induction of apoptosis, and expression of critical genes involved in drug activity may contribute to the
synergistic effect between gemcitabine and  xxxd2868xxx 
against in vitro models of lung cancer. although the extrapolation of in vitro data to the in vivo setting should be con-

is in agreement with those of a previous study which indicated that inhibitors of dna biosynthesis widely differ in
their stimulatory effect on  xxxg611xxx , and there are also “responsive” and “nonresponsive” cells with respect to  xxxg611xxx  activation (spasokoukotskaja et al., 1999). moreover, pcr analysis
of cells exposed to different concentrations of drug combinations revealed a good relationship between modulation of
 xxxg611xxx  gene expression and the type of drug interaction. gemcitabine- xxxd2868xxx  combinations at concentrations resulting in synergistic drug interaction (ic50 levels) increased
 xxxg611xxx  expression in all cell lines. on the contrary,  xxxg611xxx  gene
expression was not significantly modulated in calu-6 and
calu-1 cells in conditions of drug antagonism (0.25 effect
level). therefore, enhancement of hent1 and  xxxg611xxx  expression by  xxxd2868xxx  in the sequence pemetrexed3
gemcitabine strongly supports this combination, with upregulation of key genes  xxxg611xxx -hent1 being a marker of their
synergistic interaction.
the present in vitro experimental findings also suggest
that the pharmacogenetic profiling may contribute to the
