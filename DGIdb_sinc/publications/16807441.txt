in 2004 in europe, there were an estimated 2 886 800 incident
cases of cancer diagnosed, including data recorded in the 25
member states of the european union. lung cancer was the
most common form, with a total of 381 500 cases (13.2%) and
an estimated mortality of 341 800 cases (20% of total) [1].
around 85% of lung cancers are non-small-cell lung cancer
(nsclc), and the majority of patients present as advanced
disease, with dismal prognosis. a landmark study in nsclc
showed that the combination of  xxxd2188xxx  plus cisplatin
attained a median survival of 9.1 months in comparison with
7.6 months with cisplatin alone [2]. a phase iii trial of the
european organization for research and treatment of cancer
(eortc) showed similar results with  xxxd2824xxx cisplatin and
 xxxd2188xxx /cisplatin, with median survival times of 8.1 months
and 8.9 months, respectively. a third arm of paclitaxel/
 xxxd2188xxx  showed a shorter survival of 6.7 months [3]. a
recent meta-analysis, which included a study encompassing
4556 patients, showed a median survival of 9 months for
 xxxd2188xxx -based chemotherapy in contrast with 8.2 months
for non- xxxd2188xxx  combinations [4]. one of the mechanisms
of tumor resistance to cisplatin is increased nucleotide excision
repair (ner) activity, in particular increased levels of  xxxg724xxx .
the 59 incision made by the  xxxg724xxx -xpf complex is thought to
be a rate-limiting step in the ner pathway, as shown by an
increase in excision activity in extracts from non-cisplatinresistant cells after addition of purified  xxxg724xxx -xpf protein,

compared with no increase in excision activity after addition of
 xxxg724xxx -xpf to extracts from cisplatin-resistant cells [5]. the
potential use of  xxxg724xxx  mrna expression as a predictive
marker for the effectiveness of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is
an important area of clinical translational research. together
with  xxxg724xxx , ribonucleotide reductase subunit m1 ( xxxg1991xxx ) is
also involved in  xxxd2188xxx  metabolism as a participant in the
ner pathway, providing nucleotides that fill gaps created
by  xxxg724xxx  excision of the dna strands containing cisplatin
bulky adducts. tumor overexpression of  xxxg1991xxx  mrna in
 xxxd2188xxx /cisplatin-treated nsclc patients was associated
with a short median survival of 3.6 months in contrast with
13.7 months for patients with low  xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression
(p = 0.009) [6]. this data is ushering in a new era of
customized chemotherapy based on ner transcripts.
patients with lower dna repair capacity are more
chemosensitive than those who carry a proficient dna repair
system [7–9]. in 1995, it was shown that elevated dna repair
capacity is associated with drug resistance in lung cancer cell
lines, and it was suggested that modulation of dna repair
mechanisms, such as the incorporation of specific dna repair
inhibitors in therapeutic regimens, could help to improve
therapeutic strategies. the overall dna repair capacity was
estimated by the ability of cells to reactivate a plasmid damaged
by cisplatin (host cell reactivation assay) [10]. cytotoxicity from
cisplatin and other platinum-containing drugs results from the
formation of platinum dna adducts, and clinical outcome is
better in patients with higher levels of these adducts, indicating
that these patients have lower dna repair capacity. nucleotide
excision repair (ner) is the major mechanism for repairing
platinum dna adducts [7–9], involving the coordinated

approximately half of lung cancer patients present with metastases, and a large proportion will develop
recurrent disease, with median survival to cisplatin-based chemotherapy of 11 months. no predictive factor of
response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy is yet available in clinical practice. the nucleotide excision repair
system plays a major role in repairing a variety of distorting lesions, notably platinum-induced dna adducts.
 xxxg724xxx  is a leading gene in repairing cisplatin dna damage. we carried out three different studies examining
individually the role of  xxxg724xxx ,  xxxg1991xxx , and then both, mrna expression in paraffin-embedded pretreatment
bronchial biopsies from  xxxd2188xxx /cisplatin-treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients.
median survival was significantly prolonged in patients with low levels of  xxxg724xxx  or  xxxg1991xxx . brca1 is involved in
homologous recombination repair, and we observed that low levels of brca1 mrna significantly increased
survival in  xxxd2188xxx /cisplatin-treated patients. our observations lead us to recommend that tumors be
regularly assessed for  xxxg724xxx  and brca1 mrna expression in order to customize  xxxd2188xxx /cisplatin
treatment.

the logistic regression model for tumor progression indicated
a significant improvement for patients randomized to docetaxel
plus cisplatin based on low  xxxg724xxx  levels. although the
results are still preliminary, time to progression and survival
adjusted for age are significantly in favor of the group with
low  xxxg724xxx  levels.
brca1 has also been recognized as a marker of
chemoresistance. brca1 was overexpressed in the cisplatinresistant breast cancer cell line mcf-7 [19]. brca1 is
component of multiple dna repair pathways and functions as
a molecular determinant of response to a range of cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents. it has been demonstrated that brca1
abrogates the apoptotic phenotype induced by a range of dnadamaging agents, including cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin,
and induces dramatic responses to a range of antimicrotubule
agents, including paclitaxel and  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx . these landmark
findings indicate that brca1 functions as a differential
regulator of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [20–22].
sporadic cancers, such as breast, ovarian and nsclc, can have
the brca1 function abrogated by methylation or other
mechanisms. in addition, methylation of fancf has been
observed in these tumors. these characteristics, known as
‘brcaness’, increase sensitivity to cisplatin and related dna
cross-linking agents and may increase resistance to
antimicrotubule drugs [23]. recently, it has been shown that
brca1 or brca1 dysfunction profoundly sensitizes cells to the
inhibition of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) [24]. we
have observed that brca1 mrna expression closely correlates
with  xxxg724xxx  mrna expression and that brca1 mrna
expression predicts outcome in locally advanced nsclc
patients treated with neoadjuvant  xxxd2188xxx  plus cisplatin
followed by surgery. median survival has not been reached in
patients with the lowest brca1 mrna levels, while survival was
very poor in patients with the highest levels [25]. these findings
are along the same lines as preclinical data, indicating that
patients with high brca1 levels could respond more favorably,
not to non-cisplatin regimens but to antimicrotubule drugs.
although  xxxd2188xxx  is a neutral drug for the brca1 mrna
effect [20], we have observed that elevation of  xxxg724xxx  and
brca1 is closely related to high levels of ribonucleotide
reductase, which is one of the principal mechanisms of
resistance to  xxxd2188xxx  [26].
recently, egfr mutations have been found to occur at
a significantly higher frequency in hereditary breast cancer than
in sporadic breast cancer [27]. as the authors state, this finding

activity of more than 20 enzymes that remove a segment of dna
containing a bulky adduct and then restore that segment by
replicating the intact complementary strand. the predictive
potential of cisplatin adducts in buccal cells was demonstrated
in nsclc patients receiving daily combined treatment with
concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy. patients who had
higher adduct levels by immunocytochemistry had a median
survival of 30 months, in comparison with only 5 months for
patients with low adduct levels [11]. it was hypothesized that
patients with genetically determined effective dna repair
activity would be more likely to effectively repair dna adducts
in tumor tissue than would patients with genetically determined
suboptimal dna repair. to test this hypothesis, a functional
assay of dna repair capacity – the ability to repair
benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (bpde)-induced dna adducts –
in peripheral lymphocytes, rather than in tumors, was used.
median survival was 8.9 months for patients whose dna repair
capacity was in the top quartile, compared to 15.8 months for
patients whose dna repair capacity was in the bottom quartile
(p = 0.04) [12].
cisplatin resistance is associated with increased expression of
the excision repair cross-complementing 1 ( xxxg724xxx ) gene [13].
cancer tissues from ovarian cancer patients whose tumors were
clinically resistant to therapy showed greater levels of  xxxg724xxx 
mrna [14]. cdna derived from primary gastric tumors before
chemotherapy was used to determine  xxxg724xxx  mrna levels
expressed as the ratio of the pcr product of the  xxxg724xxx  gene
and the b-actin gene. response and survival with cisplatin plus
fluorouracil were significantly associated with levels of  xxxg724xxx 
£5.8 [15]. more modern studies have used cdna derived from
paraffin-embedded tumor specimens to determine  xxxg724xxx 
mrna expression relative to the internal reference gene b-actin,
using fluorescence-based, real-time reverse transcriptase pcr.
colorectal cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin plus
fluorouracil with low  xxxg724xxx  expression had a significantly
longer survival compared to patients with high intratumoral
 xxxg724xxx  mrna levels [16]. we carried out a study to examine
the role of  xxxg724xxx  mrna levels in advanced nsclc patients
treated with  xxxd2188xxx  plus cisplatin. patients with low
 xxxg724xxx  mrna levels attained a response rate of 52%, while in
those with high levels, the response rate was 36%. this
difference was not significant; however, when we used a cutoff
of 5.8 for  xxxg724xxx  expression, median survival was 15 months
for patients with low levels and only 5 months for those with
high levels (p < 0.001) [17].
based on these findings, we carried out an  xxxg724xxx  mrna
customized chemotherapy trial. more than 400 patients have
been included and randomized to the control or the
experimental arm. the control arm received docetaxel plus
cisplatin, and patients in the experimental arm received either
the same combination of docetaxel plus cisplatin if their  xxxg724xxx 
mrna levels were low or docetaxel plus  xxxd2188xxx  if their
levels were high (figure 1). the preliminary results on 264
patients, presented at asco 2005 [18], showed that the
response rate for patients with low  xxxg724xxx  levels was 56.6%
while for patients in the control arm it was 40.4% (p = 0.02).
when patients in the control arm were split according to the
 xxxg724xxx  levels, those with low levels had a response rate of
47.3%, while those with high levels had a response rate of 26.1%.

may not be surprising given the functional effect of brca1 and
brca2 mutations. defects in brca1 and brca2 have been
shown to disrupt the dna repair mechanism, which leads to
genomic instability. along with others, we have observed that
egfr mutations are highly predictive of response and are
a prognostic marker for survival in lung adenocarcinoma
patients [28–32]. we have observed dramatic responses,
including in brain metastases, with only treatment with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, without the need for radiotherapy or other
therapeutic interventions. so far, the data has been collected
retrospectively on gefitinib-treated patients after second- or
third-line chemotherapy failure. in our experience, the
preliminary evidence of egfr mutations in lung
adenocarcinoma patients in spain [32] indicates a frequency
of 20%. we have undertaken a prospective study of egfr
mutation assessment in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. the
egfr assay is performed rapidly with an average of five-day
wait for results. patients without egfr mutations can be
examined to determine their brca1 mrna levels for
customized chemotherapy (figure 2).
