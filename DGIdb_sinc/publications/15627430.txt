abstract
olanzapine and clozapine produce robust increases in hippocampal acetylcholine release during acetylcholinesterase inhibition, while
other antipsychotics, including thioridazine, have only small effects. since thioridazine binds with similar high affinities to muscarinic
receptors as olanzapine and clozapine, muscarinic autoreceptor blockade was ruled out as a primary mechanism [neuropsychopharmacology
26 (2002) 583]. this study compared in vitro binding affinities and functional activities of olanzapine, clozapine, thioridazine, ziprasidone,
risperidone, chlorpromazine and scopolamine at muscarinic m2 receptors with their in vivo potencies to increase acetylcholine release in the
rat hippocampus. we found that scopolamine, olanzapine and clozapine, but also high doses of thioridazine and chlorpromazine, markedly
increase acetylcholine release. the reduced in vivo potencies of thioridazine and chlorpromazine are consistent with their significantly
weaker functional antagonist activity at human muscarinic m2 receptors, while thioridazine’s reduced binding affinity for rat muscarinic m2
receptors and lower brain exposure, may further contribute to its weak in vivo potency compared to olanzapine. the excellent correlation
between in vitro antagonist activities of antipsychotics at muscarinic m2 receptors and their in vivo potencies to increase acetylcholine
release, suggests that olanzapine, clozapine, as well as thioridazine and chlorpromazine, increase acetylcholine release via blockade of
terminal muscarinic m2 autoreceptors.

1. introduction
several typical and atypical antipsychotics, including
olanzapine, clozapine and thioridazine, have high binding
affinities for the five muscarinic (m1–5) receptors (bolden et
al., 1992; bymaster et al., 1996) and are thought to act as
antagonists at all subtypes, with the possible exception of
the muscarinic  xxxg450xxx  (zorn et al., 1994). while
interaction of antipsychotics with muscarinic receptors may
have beneficial effects (bymaster et al., 2003), muscarinic

receptor blockade can also impair memory and cognitive
function, as exemplified by the effects of the potent nonselective muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (mintzer and
griffiths, 2003). assessing the beneficial vs. detrimental
effects of atypical antipsychotics with muscarinic antagonist
properties is complicated by the fact that antipsychotics can
increase acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex
(parada et al., 1997; ichikawa et al., 2002; li et al., 2003)
and hippocampus (shirazi-southall et al., 2002; chung et
al., 2003). since elevated acetylcholine levels following
antipsychotic treatment can activate postsynaptic cholinergic receptors, the net result of the opposing effects of
increased acetylcholine levels and postsynaptic muscarinic
receptor blockade will depend on both the magnitude of the
acetylcholine increase and the functional potencies at

210

postsynaptic muscarinic receptor subtypes (kennedy et al.,
2001; dean et al., 2003). therefore, it is important to know
the potencies of antipsychotics to increase acetylcholine
release in relation to their functional potencies at muscarinic
receptor subtypes.
a recent report (shirazi-southall et al., 2002) showed
that clozapine and olanzapine, but not haloperidol, ziprasidone, thioridazine or chlorpromazine, produce large, 5–15fold, increases in extracellular hippocampal acetylcholine
levels, measured by in vivo microdialysis in the presence of
an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. since thioridazine, an
antipsychotic with similar high binding affinities for
muscarinic receptors as olanzapine and clozapine, failed to
increase acetylcholine release at comparable doses, the
authors concluded that muscarinic antagonism plays a
minimal role in the acetylcholine increase. in addition, it
was suggested that the ability of these drugs to increase rat
hippocampal acetylcholine levels could translate into
cognitive benefits in schizophrenic patients.
two considerations prompted us to re-examine the potential role of muscarinic antagonism in antipsychotic-induced
acetylcholine release. first, while thioridazine has potent
binding affinities for all muscarinic subtypes, it has been
reported to have very weak functional antagonist activity
(herrling and misbach-lesenne, 1982; niedzwiecki et al.,
1989), which could account for its failure to increase
acetylcholine release in vivo. second, the magnitude of the
acetylcholine increase reported for olanzapine and clozapine
in the presence of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor seems to
be more compatible with blockade of release regulating
muscarinic autoreceptors than with any other reported
receptor mediated mechanism.
this study determined in vitro binding affinities and
functional potencies of olanzapine, clozapine, thioridazine,
ziprasidone, risperidone, chlorpromazine and scopolamine
at the cloned human muscarinic m1 and  xxxg448xxx  subtypes and studied the dose-dependency of their effects on
hippocampal acetylcholine release after systemic administration using in vivo microdialysis. in addition, local
application of olanzapine, clozapine, thioridazine, risperidone and scopolamine by retrodialysis into either the
cholinergic cell body or terminal area was used to obtain
information on their site of action. finally, brain and plasma
levels of olanzapine, thioridazine and ziprasidone were
measured in order to determine if differences in drug
exposure might contribute to reduced in vivo potencies of
thioridazine and ziprasidone.
we report here that olanzapine and clozapine, but also
high doses of thioridazine and chlorpromazine, markedly
increase extracellular acetylcholine levels in rat hippocampus and that this effect occurs locally in the hippocampus and is not mediated by direct activation of cell
bodies in the septum. compared with olanzapine, thioridazine is functionally an order of magnitude less potent as a
muscarinic antagonist, binds with lower affinity to rat
muscarinic m2 receptors and has lower brain exposure,

which fully account for the reduced in vivo potency of
thioridazine to increase acetylcholine release via antagonism
at presynaptic muscarinic m2 autoreceptors.

2. methods
principles of laboratory animal care (guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals, national academy press
1996) were followed and the animal care and use
committee of pfizer global research and development
approved all protocols.
2.1. in vitro receptor binding studies
radioligand binding assays in cell membranes from
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells expressing human muscarinic receptors or in washed rat cerebellar membranes
were performed essentially as previously described (seeger
et al., 1995). membranes were incubated in 50 mm tris hcl
buffer ph 7.4 containing 2 mm mgcl2 for 60 min at room
temperature with 0.2 nm [3h]n-methyl-scopolamine (82 ci/
mol) and varying concentrations of test compounds (0.32–
10,000 nm). incubations were terminated by rapid filtration
onto gf/b filters pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine.
non-specific binding was determined using a saturating
concentration of atropine (10 am), a potent non-selective
muscarinic inhibitor and radioactivity was quantified by
liquid scintillation counting. ic50 values were determined
by linear regression of the concentration–response data and
k i values were calculated according to the cheng prusoff
equation, k i=ic50/(1+(l/k d)), where l is the concentration
of the radioligand used in the experiment and the k d value is
the dissociation constant for the radioligand (determined
previously by saturation analysis for each tissue/receptor).
reported k i values are the meansfs.e.m. of at least three
separate experiments performed in duplicate.
2.2. in vitro functional activity studies
functional antagonist activities were determined in cho
cell lines transfected with human muscarinic m1 or m2
receptors by measuring effects on intracellular calcium flux
using a fluorimetric imaging plate reader (flipr, molecular devices). cells were maintained in cell medium,
containing dulbecco’s modified eagles medium (dmem)
high glucose with l-glutamine/with pyridoxine hydrochloride/without sodium pyruvate, 500 ag/ml  xxxg418xxx , 100 am
non-essential amino acids, 10 am hepes buffer, 2 mm lglutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated, gibco)
and harvested 48 h prior to the assay, counted and seeded at
a density of 12,500 cells/well into black 384 well, clear
bottom, collagen coated-1 plates (becton dickinson) and
incubated at 37 8c (with co2). blank wells contained assay
buffer of the following composition: 145 mm nacl, 10 mm
glucose, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 10 mm hepes and 2

d.e. johnson et al. / european journal of pharmacology 506 (2005) 209–219

mm cacl2 (ph 7.4). on the day of the assay, dye medium
was prepared by adding 22 al  xxxd1896xxx , 22 al 20%
pluronic acid, 110 al probenecid solution and 11 al of
serum-free dmem medium to a 50 ag vial of fluo-4 am
dye. the dye medium was added (25 al/well) and the plates
incubated for 75 min at 37 8c (with co2). the medium was
then removed and the cells washed three times with 50 al of
cell wash buffer (2.5 mm probenecid in assay buffer).
excess dye was separated from the cells by incubation in 30
al cell wash buffer for 45 min at 37 8c. assay plates were
then loaded onto the flipr and read at excitation and
emission wavelengths of 488 and 516 nm, respectively.
when looking for antagonists, the order of addition
necessitates the identification of compounds that act as
agonists, since agonist depletion of internal calcium stores
can mimic the effect of an antagonist. therefore, test
compounds were added and a flipr reading was taken to
identify possible agonists prior to the addition of the known
agonist. finally, the muscarinic agonist carbachol (20 nm
for m1, 1 am for m2) was added and the reduction in the
carbachol signal was measured to determine the antagonist
activity of the test compounds. ic50 values were estimated
by non-linear regression of concentration–response data and
k b values were calculated using the cheng prusoff equation.
k b values are the means of four separate experiments each
performed in triplicate.
2.3. in vivo microdialysis studies
microdialysis was performed in freely moving male
sprague–dawley rats (300–350 g), according to standard
procedures. briefly, guide cannulas (bioanalytical systems)
were implanted into the hippocampus (ap 5.2 from
bregma, ml f5.0, dv 3.3 from dura) under isoflurane
anesthesia and fixed to the skull. for dual probe experiments,
a second guide cannula was targeted at the septum (ap +0.5
from bregma, ml +1.0, dv 5.0 from dura, at a 98 angle
from vertical toward midline). after guide cannula implantation, animals were housed separately in a perspex rat cage
inside an isolation box with free access to food and water and
a 12-h light–dark cycle (7 a.m. lights on, 7 p.m. lights off).
one day after surgery, a 4-mm microdialysis probe was
inserted into the guide cannula and perfused overnight at 0.3
al/min with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (acsf: nacl, 147
mm; cacl2, 1.3 mm; kcl, 2.7 mm; mgcl2, 1.0 mm). for
dual probe experiments, a 2-mm probe was inserted into the
septal guide. around 7:30 a.m. on the day after probe
insertion, 100 nm neostigmine-bromide was added to the
acsf, the flow rate was increased to 2 al/min and hippocampal dialysates were collected in a 30-al sample loop and
analyzed by on-line high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection at 17-min intervals. for
dual probe experiments, drugs were dissolved in acsf
(without neostigmine) and perfused into the septum at 2 al/
min, while acetylcholine was measured in hippocampal
dialysate. acetylcholine in microdialysates was assayed

211

using a modification of an acetylcholine–choline assay kit
from bas (bioanalytical systems). briefly, acetylcholine
was separated at 1 ml/min at 28 8c over two 10-cm bas
polymer mf 6150 acetylcholine analytical columns,
connected in series, using a mobile phase with 35 mm
na2hpo4, 0.1 mm edta and 0.005% proclin adjusted to
ph 8.5 with phosphoric acid. acetylcholine was then
converted in a post-column acetylcholine–choline immobilized enzyme reactor (bas mf-6151 acetylcholine/choline
imer) to  xxxd2298xxx , which was detected electrochemically at a platinum electrode at a potential of +0.5 v vs.
ag/agcl. (antec decade, leyden, the netherlands).
once basal acetylcholine levels had stabilized (after 8–10
samples), drugs were administered and the effects on
acetylcholine monitored for at least 3 h. drug-induced
changes in extracellular acetylcholine levels were expressed
as percentages of baseline (mean of last five to six basal
samples)fs.e.m. (n=4–8) and used to construct time
courses. since handling the animals and s.c. injection of
vehicle consistently caused a small, rapid and short lasting
acetylcholine increase, which returned to basal levels within
50 min, the average response over 51–102 min after drug
administration was used for the dose–response curves. for a
comparison of in vivo potencies, we estimated the dose of
each compound that produces a four-fold acetylcholine
increase from the s.c. dose–response curves (ed400%), since
responses to these doses are on the ascending part of the
dose–response curves and data bracket the four-fold change.
limited solubility prevented perfusions with sufficiently
high concentrations to reach four-fold increases for all
compounds, so we choose the concentrations that produce a
three-fold acetylcholine increase (ec300%) for potency
comparisons, again with responses on the ascending part
of the concentration–response curves and data bracketing
the three-fold change.
2.4. hplc/mass spec analysis of ziprasidone, thioridazine
and olanzapine
at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h after s.c. administration of 10 mg/kg
olanzapine, 10 mg/kg thioridazine or 3.2 mg/kg ziprasidone
to male sprague–dawley rats (300–350 g), plasma and
whole brain were collected. brain tissue, homogenized in
three mass equivalents h2o, and plasma samples were
subjected to liquid–liquid extraction using the following
method: 200 al of each matrix was sampled and spiked with
20 ng of an internal standard (different for each compound).
to this mixture, 100 al of 1 m nahco3 was added. the
mixture was vortexed with 0.5-ml methyl-t-butylether for 5
min. the organic and aqueous phases were then separated
by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min. the organic layer
was removed and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at
ambient temperature. the residue was reconstituted in 200
al of 70% methanol in h2o and analyzed by hplc-ms.
standards for plasma, brain and csf analysis were prepared
from identically treated blank sample matrices, which were

212

d.e. johnson et al. / european journal of pharmacology 506 (2005) 209–219

subsequently spiked with the analyte of interest. an agilent
hp-1100 quaternary pump system (agilent, palo alto, ca,
usa), and a ctc pal autosampler (ctc analytics,
zwingen, switzerland) were used to separate compounds
and internal standards on a 502.1 mm i.d. ace c-8
column (advanced chromatography technologies, aberdeen, scotland) at ambient temperature. mobile phase baq
consisted of 10 mm ammonium formate adjusted to either
ph 3.0 with  xxxd2154xxx  (ziprasidone, thioridazine) or left
ph unadjusted (olanzapine). mobile phase bbq consisted of
100% acetonitrile. a linear gradient from 85% baq to 5%
baq over 1.5 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min was run for all
analyses. eluants were detected using a micromass quattro
ultima mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray
ionization source (waters, milford, ma, usa) operated in
positive ion mrm mode. reported brain and plasma
concentrations represent the meanfs.d. (n=4).

scopolamine, thioridazine, clozapine, haloperidol, risperidone, chlorpromazine, 7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1h-3-benzazepine (sch-23390) and
2-hydroxypropyl-h-cyclodextrin were purchased from
sigma (st. louis, oh); [3h]n-methyl-scopolamine from
perkin elmer (boston, ma); methanol from j.t. baker
(philipsburg, nj); and all other analytical grade chemicals
from fluka chemika-biochemika (ronkonkoma, ny).
cho cell lines expressing the human muscarinic receptors
were obtained from dr. thomas bonner (nih). ziprasidone
and thioridazine were dissolved in 40% 2-hydroxypropyl-hcyclodextrin, all other compounds in 5.5% glucose acidified
with acetic acid unless otherwise noted. drugs were
administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in a volume of 1 ml/kg.
for local drug perfusions via the microdialysis probe, stock
solutions of the compounds in acsf were diluted with acsf
to the appropriate concentration.

2.5. data handling and statistics
3. results
to determine statistical differences between treatments,
data were analyzed in sas version 8 (sas institute, cary,
nc, usa), using a mixed effects repeated measures model
with autoregressive order 1 variance. the data were
repeated by time nested within dose. multiple comparisons
of the time course data were done using the western electric
procedure for runs (small, 1956) to control the family-wise
and experiment-wise error rates. all data were analyzed
together to obtain the most accurate estimate of error. fvalues were used to determine if time nested within dose
was significant for each compound and then t-values were
used to determine which times within doses were significant. to determine statistical differences between doses, or
concentrations, a mixed effect model was used with animal
as a random effect and with compound symmetric variance.
multiple comparisons were done using dunnett’s procedure,
which produces adjusted p values that were considered
significant when less than 0.05. all data were again
analyzed together to obtain the most accurate estimate of
error. overall f-values were used to determine if there was a
difference in concentrations and then t-values from dunnett’s procedure determine which concentrations differed
from baseline. to determine estimates of ed400% and
ec300% values, the percentage of baseline was first
regressed onto the doses, or the concentrations, that
bracketed the four-fold or three-fold change, respectively,
and then using inverse prediction. a 95% inverse prediction
interval was then calculated for each estimate. the
regression analysis, inverse predictions and inverse prediction intervals were performed using r version 1.8.1 (the r
foundation for statistical computing).
2.6. drugs and chemicals
ziprasidone and olanzapine were synthesized at pfizer
global research and development (groton, ct, usa).

3.1. in vitro binding affinities and functional activities at
muscarinic m1 and m2 receptors
thioridazine binds to human muscarinic m1 and m2
receptors expressed in cho cells with similar high affinities
as olanzapine and clozapine (k i 1.4–14 nm, table 1), but its
functional muscarinic m2 antagonist potency (k b=188 nm)
is 10-fold less than that of olanzapine and 5-fold less than
clozapine (table 2). chlorpromazine binds with moderate
affinity to human muscarinic m2 receptors (k i=150 nm) and
is functionally about 35-fold less potent than olanzapine as a
muscarinic m2 antagonist (k b=601 nm). scopolamine has
the highest affinity (k i=0.1–0.2 nm) and functional antagonist activity (k b=0.16–0.09 nm) at muscarinic m1 and m2
receptors. ziprasidone, risperidone and haloperidol have no
appreciable affinity at human muscarinic m1 or m2
receptors. binding affinities of the compounds to native
muscarinic receptors in rat cerebellar membranes, which are

85% muscarinic m2 receptors (cohen et al., 2000), are
generally lower than affinities for human m2 receptors
(table 1), while thioridazine and chlorpromazine bind with
5–10-fold lower affinity than olanzapine to native rat m2
receptors.
3.2. effects of systemically administered test compounds on
acetylcholine release
the mean basal acetylcholine concentration in microdialysates from rat hippocampus collected in the presence of
100 nm neostigmine was 10.1f0.4 nm (300 fmol/30 al
sample) and ranged from 3.7 to 16.8 nm (n=60). vehicle
administration (acidified 5.5% glucose or 40% cyclodextrin)
did not change acetylcholine levels except for a rapid,
transient 1.5-fold increase that returned to baseline within
50 min. the average vehicle response over the time period
51–102 min, used to construct dose–response curves
(96f5% for acidified glucose and 110f7% for 40% 2hydroxypropyl-h-cyclodextrin), were not significantly different from basal levels. administration of high doses of the
test compounds caused mild and transient sedative effects.
time courses for effects of 10 mg/kg of atypical
antipsychotics show that olanzapine and clozapine produce robust and sustained increases in acetylcholine levels
in the rat hippocampus to seven-fold (t [13] =7.95,
pb0.0001) and four-fold (t [16]=7.3, pb0.0001) over basal
levels, respectively, at 2 h (fig. 1). ziprasidone treatment
produced a modest 1.4-fold elevation of acetylcholine
release, which was significant at the 6.5% level (t [8]=
2.51, p=0.064). while 10 mg/kg thioridazine had no
effect on acetylcholine release (t [11]=0.72, p=0.820) and
32 mg/kg produced a not significant two-fold increase
(t [11]=1.48, p=0.3636), 100 mg/kg thioridazine significantly increased acetylcholine levels four-fold (t [11]=5.87,

p=0.0003; fig. 2). likewise, a high dose of 100 mg/kg
chlorpromazine produced a significant 2.5-fold increase
(t [4]=8.61, p=0.018) in acetylcholine release (fig. 3).
haloperidol at 1 mg/kg did not have a significant effect
on acetylcholine levels (t [4]= 1.24, p=0.284).
the effects of systemic treatment with antipsychotics on
extracellular acetylcholine levels are dose-dependent and
dose–response curves of olanzapine, clozapine and thioridazine show a parallel shift to the right compared with
scopolamine (fig. 3). a comparison of the estimated s.c.
doses required to increase acetylcholine release to 400% of
basal levels shows that olanzapine is the most potent of the
antipsychotics tested, with an ed400% of 6.6f3.2 mg/kg
(fig. 3), being 2.5 and 15 times more potent than clozapine
(ed400%=16.3f7.8 mg/kg) and thioridazine (ed400%=
97f37 mg/kg), respectively. scopolamine, a non-selective
muscarinic antagonist with the highest affinity for muscarinic receptors among the test compounds, showed the
highest potency in this in vivo model, causing a maximal

(ec300%=129f108 am), respectively. scopolamine is also
the most potent compound after local perfusion and with
an ec300% of 0.01f0.02 am it is approximately 850 times
more potent than locally applied olanzapine (fig. 6). it
should be noted that these are drug concentrations in the
perfusate and that the amount of drug that actually reaches
the tissue, typically 5–10% of the perfusate concentration,
is unknown.
linear regression analysis shows that in vivo potencies
of the test compounds to increase acetylcholine release in
the rat hippocampus (ed400% or ec300%) are highly
correlated with their in vitro functional potencies (k b) at
muscarinic m2 receptors. the correlation coefficients for log
k b vs. log ed400% and vs. log ec300% are 0.998 and 0.985,
respectively, and the slopes from the fitted regression
equations are not significantly different from 1.

3.3. effect of locally perfused test compounds in cell bodies
or terminals by retrodialysis
to examine whether olanzapine exerts its effect on
hippocampal acetylcholine release in cell bodies or terminals,
it was delivered directly into the terminal area (hippocampus)
or cell body area (septum) by retrodialysis, while monitoring
effects on acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus. local
perfusion of 10 am olanzapine into cell bodies did not
increase acetylcholine release in the hippocampus (t [6]=0.13,
p=0.9876). to verify correct probe placement and proper
functioning of the cholinergic system, the glutamatergic
agonist kainic acid (25 am) was subsequently perfused into
the septum as a positive control and was found to increase
hippocampal acetylcholine release to six-fold over basal
levels (t [6]=14.65, pb0.0001; fig. 4). in contrast, local
application of olanzapine into the hippocampus (fig. 5)
produced a non significant 1.8-fold increase in acetylcholine
release after 1 am (t [8]=1.77, p=0.2636) and a significant 3.5fold increase after 10 am (t [8]=5.20, p=0.0022), while a 100
am olanzapine perfusion produced a similar seven-fold
acetylcholine increase (t [8]=12.11, pb0.0001), as observed
after systemic administration of 10 mg/kg olanzapine (figs. 3
and 6). hippocampal acetylcholine levels were also significantly increased after local perfusions of 0.01 am scopolamine (t [4]=4.88, p=0.0142), 10 am clozapine (t [8]=4.32,
p=0.0068) and 100 am thioridazine (t [9]=4.97, p=0.0021)
into the terminal area (fig. 6). a comparison of the perfusate
concentrations required to cause  xxxd3426xxx % increase in
acetylcholine release shows that olanzapine (ec300%=
8.6f2.7 am) is approximately 5 and 15 times more potent
than clozapine (ec300%=50.5f47.2 am) and thioridazine

after a single 10 mg/kg dose, brain levels of olanzapine
increased rapidly reaching a c max of 7500 ng/g within 0.5–1
h and decreased to 2600 ng/g after 4 h. olanzapine plasma
levels showed a similar time course with a c max of 2960 ng/
ml at 0.5 h and decreasing to 790 ng/ml at 4 h. brain and
plasma levels after 10 mg/kg thioridazine were lower and
reached maximum levels slower than olanzapine, with c max
values of 2,050 ng/g and 250 ng/ml, respectively, at 2 h and
remaining steady until 4 h. ziprasidone brain and plasma
levels after 3.2 mg/kg were 287 ng/g and 422 ng/ml,
respectively, at 1 h after administration.

4. discussion
4.1. increases in acetylcholine release via muscarinic
antagonism
our data confirm the ability of olanzapine and clozapine
to produce robust increases in extracellular acetylcholine
levels in rat hippocampus in the presence of neostigmine, as
previously reported by shirazi-southall et al. (2002). the
results from our and previous studies provide several lines
of evidence that the large increases in acetylcholine release,
produced during acetylcholinesterase inhibition by antipsychotics with muscarinic antagonist properties, including
thioridazine and chlorpromazine, are mediated via blockade
of muscarinic m2 autoreceptors.
first, olanzapine and clozapine are potent functional
antagonists at muscarinic m2 receptors and produce
increases in extracellular acetylcholine levels during
acetylcholinesterase inhibition that are of the same order

215

of magnitude as those following administration of the
muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, which enhances acetylcholine release by blocking muscarinic m2 autoreceptors
(douglas et al., 2001; stillman et al., 1996; kitaichi et al.,
1999a,b). recent data showing that clozapine- and
olanzapine-induced increases in acetylcholine release are
dependent on the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor concentration (ichikawa et al., 2002; chung et al., 2003)
corroborate a muscarinic antagonist mechanism, since the
local cholinergic tone significantly influences the magnitude of muscarinic receptor antagonist-induced acetylcholine increases. second, local perfusions with a high
concentration of olanzapine produce four-fold increases
in terminal acetylcholine release when administered into
the terminal hippocampal area, but have no effect when
perfused into the cell bodies in the septum, in agreement
with the lack of effects following local perfusions with the
muscarinic antagonist atropine (moor et al., 1995). third,
the in vivo potencies of compounds to increase acetylcholine release after systemic or intracerebral administration
correlate highly with their in vitro functional potencies at
muscarinic m2 receptors. finally, antipsychotics that share
several receptor affinities with olanzapine and clozapine,
but are devoid of muscarinic m2 antagonist properties,
only modestly increase acetylcholine release during acetylcholinesterase inhibition.
nevertheless, in previous reports, muscarinic antagonism was not considered to be the predominant mechanism, mainly because thioridazine and chlorpromazine,
antipsychotics with high to moderate binding affinity for
muscarinic m2 receptors, failed to produce robust acetylcholine increases after systemic doses of 10–30 mg/kg
(shirazi-southall et al., 2002; ichikawa et al., 2002; li et
al., 2003; bymaster et al., 2003). however, while 10 mg/
kg thioridazine failed to significantly increase acetylcholine, a higher dose of 100 mg/kg produced a marked
increase in acetylcholine release to four-fold over basal
levels. likewise, chlorpromazine also has the ability to
increases acetylcholine release, producing a 2.5-fold
increase after 100 mg/kg. moreover, intra-hippocampal
perfusions demonstrate that thioridazine, like olanzapine,
clozapine, ziprasidone and scopolamine, increase acetylcholine levels via a local action in the hippocampus,
consistent with muscarinic antagonism at terminal presynaptic muscarinic m2 receptors.
the reduced in vivo potencies of thioridazine and
chlorpromazine can be largely explained by their surprisingly weak muscarinic m2 antagonist potencies, since
thioridazine and chlorpromazine are respectively 10- and
35-fold less potent  xxxg448xxx  antagonists than olanzapine.
in addition, while thioridazine and olanzapine bind with
equal affinities to human m2 receptors, thioridazine has a
five-fold lower affinity than olanzapine for native rat brain
muscarinic m2 receptors, which seems more relevant for
effects that occur in rat brain than binding affinities at
human or rat heart receptors. the weaker functional activity

216

d.e. johnson et al. / european journal of pharmacology 506 (2005) 209–219

plus the reduced binding affinity for native rat muscarinic
m2 receptors explain why much higher doses and concentrations of thioridazine are required to produce acetylcholine responses in vivo similar to olanzapine and clozapine.
such a disparity between the functional activity and binding
affinity of thioridazine at muscarinic receptors was previously demonstrated by niedzwiecki et al. (1989), who
showed that thioridazine is several orders of magnitude less
potent than atropine in antagonizing carbachol-induced
acetylcholine overflow in rabbit striatal slices. these large
differences between binding affinities and functional
activities are likely due to differences in assay conditions
(e.g. assay buffer, assay temperature, cell membranes vs.
whole cells).
recent data showing that olanzapine increases acetylcholine release to the same extent in m2/m4 knockout mice as
in wild-type mice, whereas scopolamine shows an attenuated response in knockout mice (bymaster et al., 2003),
seem to argue against an involvement of muscarinic m2
receptors. however, without the strong inhibitory control
supplied by muscarinic m2 autoreceptors, the otherwise
small contributions of non-muscarinic receptor mechanisms
to the acetylcholine increase, such as seen without a
cholinesterase inhibitor, could be amplified in genetically
altered mice and cause similar olanzapine-induced acetylcholine increases in knockout as in wild-type mice. in
contrast, the effects of the muscarinic receptor antagonist
scopolamine are exclusively mediated by muscarinic m2
receptor blockade and thus attenuated in m2 deficient mice.
taken together with the striking differences between
cholinergic effects in mice and rats (drug-induced acetylcholine increases are 5–10-fold lower in mice than in rats), the
data in m2/m4 knockout mice are not inconsistent with an
important role of muscarinic autoreceptors in the rat
acetylcholine release model.
4.2. other possible mechanisms of antipsychotic-induced
acetylcholine release
given the fact that antipsychotics have high affinities for
multiple receptors and receptor subtypes, it is likely that
other receptor mechanisms contribute to the acetylcholine
increase produced by some antipsychotics during acetylcholinesterase inhibition. however, there are few known
receptor-mediated mechanism that can account for the
magnitude of the increase in acetylcholine release observed
after olanzapine and clozapine treatment. ichikawa et al.
(2002) and shirazi-southall et al. (2002) have extensively
discussed receptors that are possibly involved in mediating
the acetylcholine increase, such as 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a/c,  xxxg1112xxx , dopamine d2 receptors and a1/2 adrenoceptors.
however, blockade of these receptors only results in modest
increases in acetylcholine release and likely mediates the
small acetylcholine increases produced by all atypical
antipsychotics in the absence of an acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor (ichikawa et al., 2002; chung et al., 2003). for

instance, activation of 5-ht1a receptors, known to increase
hippocampal acetylcholine levels by 1.5–2-fold (shirazisouthall et al., 2002; erb et al., 1997) could explain the
small acetylcholine increase following ziprasidone and
could also contribute to the clozapine-induced acetylcholine
release, since both compounds are  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, but does not play a role in the effects of olanzapine,
which has poor affinity for 5-ht1a receptors (bymaster et
al., 1996).
there are two other receptor mechanisms that are known
to cause pronounced increases in hippocampal acetylcholine release. one is receptor-mediated activation of cholinergic cell bodies located in the septum that can enhance
hippocampal acetylcholine release five-fold (moor et al.,
1996). however, when olanzapine is directly applied via the
microdialysis probe into the septum, at a concentration that
produces a robust acetylcholine increase when perfused into
the hippocampus, extracellular acetylcholine levels in the
ipsilateral hippocampus are not affected, suggesting that
cell body receptor activation is not involved in the
olanzapine-induced acetylcholine increase, consistent with
the observation that the muscarinic antagonist atropine does
not activate receptors in the septum after local infusion
(moor et al., 1995). another mechanism causing robust
acetylcholine increases is activation of a permissive
dopamine synapse dependent pathway, recently described
by rao et al. (2003), who reported that a nicotinic agonistinduced 20-fold increase in acetylcholine release was
completely blocked by the nicotinic antagonist  xxxd2550xxx , as well as by the  xxxg655xxx  antagonist
sch-23390. in addition, direct activation of the dopamine
 xxxg655xxx  by the  xxxg655xxx  agonist dihydrexidine increased acetylcholine levels in rat frontal cortex
three-fold (steele et al., 1997). since we found that the
effect of olanzapine on acetylcholine release was not
attenuated by pretreatment with sch-23390 (data not
shown), neither activation of a permissive dopamine
synapse dependent pathway nor of the dopamine d1
receptor is involved in the effects of olanzapine.
4.3. pharmacokinetic considerations
since differences in drug exposures can also contribute
to reduced in vivo potencies of certain antipsychotics, we
measured plasma and brain levels of olanzapine, thioridazine and ziprasidone after single s.c. doses. the results
show that while olanzapine and thioridazine both have
high brain exposure after 10 mg/kg s.c., thioridazine levels
are substantially lower than those of olanzapine, which
may partially contribute to thioridazine’s inability to
increase extracellular levels of acetylcholine at low doses.
since ziprasidone reaches sufficiently high brain levels to
elicit a pharmacological effect after a 3.2 mg/kg dose, its
small effect on acetylcholine release is due to lack of
muscarinic antagonist properties rather than to poor brain
penetration.

4.4. muscarinic antagonism of olanzapine and clozapine in
other in vivo models
several in vivo pre-clinical studies have demonstrated
functional anti-muscarinic activity by olanzapine and
clozapine, despite a reportedly low occupancy of muscarinic
receptors in rat brain by olanzapine and clozapine (zhang
and bymaster, 1999). for instance, clozapine blocks
carbachol- and acetylcholine-induced, but not glutamateinduced, firing in hippocampal neurons in anesthetized cats
(herrling and misbach-lesenne, 1982). also, olanzapine
and clozapine block oxotremorine-induced tremors in mice
at doses comparable to those used in this study, olanzapine
being 4 times more potent than clozapine (moore et al.,
1992). since oxotremorine-induced tremors are considered
to be associated with muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  activation
(gomeza et al., 2001), these data are consistent with the
relative potencies of the two compounds to increase
acetylcholine release via muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  blockade.
furthermore, olanzapine and clozapine block a muscarinic
 xxxg447xxx  mediated effect,  xxxd2950xxx induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in rat hippocampus (zhang and bymaster, 1999), in agreement with their high affinities and
functional antagonist activities at muscarinic m1 receptors.
although it is not known what level of receptor occupancy
by muscarinic antagonists is necessary to manifest central
nervous system effects, these data demonstrate the potential
for in vivo muscarinic antagonism during olanzapine
treatment.
4.5. improvement in cognitive function via muscarinic
antagonism?
there is evidence that atypical antipsychotics have
beneficial effects on some of the cognitive impairments in
schizophrenia, such as deficits in learning, secondary
memory, attention and executive functioning (harvey and
keefe, 2001). since increased acetylcholine release is
known to improve cognitive and memory functions, most
likely via postsynaptic muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  activation
(fischer, 2003), it was speculated that the robust effects of
olanzapine and clozapine on acetylcholine levels contribute
to the improvement in cognitive function (shirazi-southall
et al., 2002). as olanzapine and clozapine lack muscarinic
subtype selectivity, it has to be assumed that the acetylcholine increase produced by these compounds is sufficient to
overcome simultaneous  xxxg447xxx  blockade, so that the
net outcome of the balance between the opposing effects of
olanzapine on acetylcholine release and  xxxg447xxx  blockade is cognitive improvement (zhang and bymaster, 1999;
kennedy et al., 2001; shirazi-southall et al., 2002; dean et
al., 2003). however, the fact that olanzapine is at least an
equipotent muscarinic m1 and m2 antagonist in vitro, either
in binding affinities or in functional potencies (tables 1 and
2), argues against this assumption. in addition, in vivo data
also indicate that olanzapine is a slightly more potent as m1

217

antagonist, blocking a muscarinic m1 mediated effect,
 xxxd2950xxx induced pi hydrolysis (zhang and bymaster,
1999), more effectively than muscarinic m2 mediated
effects, such as oxotremorine-induced tremors (moore et
al., 1992) and autoreceptor control of acetylcholine release
(this study). hence, doses of olanzapine that increase
acetylcholine release via muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  blockade
will most likely also block postsynaptic muscarinic m1
receptors. moreover, olanzapine only produces the large
acetylcholine increases during acetylcholinesterase inhibition, so that under normal tonic conditions, when olanzapine only moderately enhances acetylcholine release
(ichikawa et al., 2002), much less acetylcholine is available
to overcome postsynaptic receptor blockade. finally, the
non-selective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine has a
similar muscarinic m2 to m1 antagonist potency ratio as
olanzapine (tables 1 and 2), but causes cognitive impairment and amnesia by blocking postsynaptic muscarinic m1
receptors (carey et al., 2001), and olanzapine has been
shown to produce scopolamine-like cognitive deficits in
some animal models (rasmussen et al., 2001). therefore,
while olanzapine and clozapine have been reported to
improve some aspects of cognition, our data suggest that it
is unlikely that such an improvement is mediated by
increased ach release, but possibly by other mechanisms
that are shared by most atypical antipsychotics, including
those that do not produce robust ach increases in the
presence of neostigmine. in fact, if the balance of increased
acetylcholine levels and muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  blockade
determines effects on cognitive function, one can speculate
that antipsychotics that produce only modest acetylcholine
increases, but lack affinity for muscarinic receptors and
therefore the potential to block postsynaptic m1 receptors,
could improve cognitive deficits via a cholinergic mechanism. results from recent studies, showing performance in
patients improved after switching from olanzapine to
ziprasidone (harvey et al., 2004), are consistent with this
notion. interestingly, it was recently reported (sur et al.,
2003) that n-desmethylclozapine, a major clozapine metabolite, binds to an allosteric site and has agonist activity at the
muscarinic  xxxg447xxx . if the muscarinic  xxxg447xxx 
agonist activity of n-desmethylclozapine could overcome
clozapine’s muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  antagonist activity, this
could facilitate m1 mediated cholinergic neurotransmission
and could differentiate clozapine’s cognitive profile from
that of olanzapine.
in conclusion, while the finding that olanzapine and
clozapine cause robust acetylcholine increases in rat hippocampus during acetylcholinesterase inhibition is in agreement with the results of shirazi-southall et al. (2002), our
additional data suggest that this effect is most likely mediated
by blockade of muscarinic m2 autoreceptors. the failure of
thioridazine and chlorpromazine to increase acetylcholine
levels at doses comparable to those of olanzapine and
clozapine is mainly due to their much weaker functional
antagonist activities at muscarinic m2 receptors, while lower

218

d.e. johnson et al. / european journal of pharmacology 506 (2005) 209–219

brain levels and lower binding affinities at rat brain
muscarinic m2 receptors further reduce their in vivo
potencies. the excellent agreement between in vivo potencies of the antipsychotics to increase acetylcholine release
and their in vitro functional activities at muscarinic m2
receptors is consistent with a muscarinic m2 antagonist
mechanism. while improvements in schizophrenic patients
treated with atypical antipsychotics have been reported for a
wide range of cognitive parameters, clinical measures that
will predict significant functional improvement in patients
and the neurochemical mechanisms behind those improvements are still unclear (harvey and keefe, 2001). given their
potent antagonist activity at all muscarinic receptors, it is
unlikely that the increase in acetylcholine seen with
olanzapine or clozapine is responsible for the cognitive
improvements reported for these drugs.
