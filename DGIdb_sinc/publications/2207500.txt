1 the calcium sensitivity of force production of cardiac muscle fibres is altered by certain drugs. the
sites of action of three such compounds (pimobendan, sulmazole, isomazole) within the myofibril have
been investigated. calmodulin antagonists,  xxxd2884xxx  and  xxxd318xxx , which have been shown to alter the
calcium dependence of myofibrillar atpase activity and oxmetidine, an h2-receptor antagonist which
binds to calmodulin, were also studied.
2 the rates of dissociation of calcium from both the regulatory and high affinity sites on bovine isolated
cardiac  xxxg2307xxx  (ctnc) were measured in a stopped-flow fluorimeter. the rates of dissociation were
found to be 136.5 + 16 s- and 1.3 + 0.20s'- (mean + s.e.mean, n = 11 determinations; conditions:
100 mm kcl, 10 mm mops, 3 mm mgci2, 0.1 mm dithriothreitol, ph 7.0, 15'c). sulmazole, isomazole and
 xxxd2884xxx  (final concentration of 50pum) had no effect on the rate of ca2+ dissociation from the regulatory ca2 + site, indicating that these compounds do not act on ctnc directly.
3 the rate of dissociation of ca2 + from the regulatory site was slightly reduced (- 20%) by pimobendan
(50 and 100,pm) and was somewhat increased by oxmetidine (28% at 100pum).
4  xxxd318xxx  (25 ,um) reduced the rate of dissociation by 50%, indicating a direct effect of  xxxd318xxx  on tnc.
5 sulmazole, isomazole,  xxxd2884xxx , pimobendan (50pm) and  xxxd318xxx  (25 um) were without effect on the
rate of dissociation of ca2+ from the high affinity ca2 +/mg2+ sites. oxmetidine caused 24% decrease in
the rate of ca2 + dissociation from these sites.
6 the rate of dissociation of ca2+ from the regulatory site on the complex of troponin-tropomyosin
(tntm) was measured. sulmazole and pimobendan (50um) were without effect on the rate of dissociation
of ca2+ from the regulatory site in the protein complex, and isomazole (50pm) caused only a slight
reduction (23%).  xxxd2884xxx  (50pm) or  xxxd318xxx  (10pum) reduced the rate of ca2` dissociation by about
50%. the rate of dissociation of ca2+ from the high affinity ca2 +/mg2 + sites was not altered by sulmazole, isomazole, or pimobendan (50m), but was decreased - 35% by  xxxd2884xxx  (50um) or  xxxd318xxx 

(10pm).

introduction
drugs which increase the force of contraction of the failing
heart may have therapeutic benefit in congestive heart failure.
one possible mechanism of action of such drugs may be to
increase the ca2 + sensitivity of the contractile proteins
(adelstein & eisenberg, 1980; ruegg, 1987; wetzel & hauel,
1988).
regulation of cardiac contractility involves ca2 +dependent changes in the actin-bound troponin-tropomyosin
(tntm) complex (reviewed in zot & potter, 1987). the troponin complex (tn) is composed of three subunits. troponin
c (tnc) is the ca2 +-binding subunit. cardiac muscle tnc has
two high affinity, metal binding sites in the c-terminal region
which can bind ca2+ or mg2', and one low affinity, ca2 +
binding site near the n-terminus. skeletal muscle tnc has
two high affinity, c-terminal sites, and two low affinity ca2+
specific n-terminal sites (van eerd & takahashi, 1975). troponin i (tni) the inhibitory subunit which inhibits actinmyosin interaction, can be phosphorylated in heart by
adenosine 3': 5'-cyclic monophosphate ( xxxd1773xxx )-dependent protein kinase. troponin t (tnt) enhances the interaction of the other subunits with tropomyosin.
in cardiac muscle, the free ca2 + concentration reaches
about 1,um during systole (allen & kurihara, 1980). this is
only sufficient to produce half-maximal activation of force
(fabiato, 1983). a drug which increases the ca2 + occupancy
of the low affinity ca2+ specific site of the tn complex may,
therefore, increase the interaction of actin and myosin and,

author for correspondence.

hence, produce a greater force at a given level of cytoplasmic
ca2+ (johnson et al., 1979).
cardiotonic agents have been identified which appear to act
directly on the contractile proteins, increasing their sensitivity
to ca2+ (wetzel & hauel, 1988). this is shown by an increase
in the force produced by skinned cardiac tissue preparations
at a submaximal ca2+ concentration, reflecting an alteration
in the affinity of regulatory ca2+ specific sites which are
involved in activation of force production (pan & solaro,
1987).
in vitro, ca2 + sensitising agents have been identified by
their effects on the adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (atpase)
activity of washed myofibrils, which retain the basic thick and
thin filament arrangement of the contractile proteins in intact
muscle. measurement of myofibrillar atpase has been
favoured as an in vitro screen for ca2 + sensitising agents,
because of its apparent simplicity and the ease of protein
preparation and assay. however, it is becoming apparent that
the data from these assays may not predict the likely effects of
the drugs in muscle. this may be because the behaviour of the
myofibrils during the atpase assay is complex and ill defined
(discussed in smith & england, 1989). in general, compounds
may modify v.,,, or basal atpase activity in addition to any
effects on ca2+ sensitivity (silver et al., 1985). these results
suggest that the compounds identified as ca2+ sensitisers in
vivo may act at sites in addition to those on the troponin
complex.
in order to facilitate the development of more specific
drugs, it is important to determine where they act within the
contractile apparatus here, we have used systems of increasing complexity to define the sites of action of compounds

within the tntm complex. we have compared the effects of
compounds known to be ca2+ sensitisers on the rates of
ca2+ release from ca2+ binding sites on isolated tnc or on
tntm.
the rates of ca2+ release from sites on isolated cardiac
tnc have been measured by stop-flow with a fluorescent chelator. this identifies agents which increase the ca2+ affinity of
tnc directly.
the rates of ca2+ release from the low affinity ca2+specific and high affinity ca2"/mg2" sites of the cardiac
tntm complex have also been measured. tni labelled covalently with a fluorescent probe incorporated into the tntm
complex was found to indicate the ca2+ occupancy of these
sites. this provides an assay for ca2+-sensitizing compounds
which act on some component of the tntm complex.
with these approaches, we have investigated the sites of
action of the calcium sensitisers (reviewed by wetzel & hauel,
1988) pimobendan, sulmazole and isomazole, and calmodulin
antagonists,  xxxd2884xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  (silver et al., 1985).
a combination of the methods described here can be used
for the first step in the development of an accurate structureactivity relationship that will allow rational drug design of
better ca2+ sensitising compounds, acting on known components of the tntm complex.

methods
protein preparation
tnc was prepared from beef heart essentially as described in
szynkiewicz et al. (1985) by ion exchange chromatography of
urea-extracted, edta-washed cardiac myofibrils. a protease
inhibitor cocktail was included throughout (5ojm phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride, 1 pg ml - 1 each of leupeptin, pepstatin and antipain). purification by ion exchange
chromatography was found to be more effective than calciumdependent hydrophobic interaction chromatography. the
appropriate eluate from deae sephadex a25 was bound to a
pharmacia fplc mono-q column and eluted with a gradient of 0 to 1 m nacl in 20 mm tris hci, 0.5 mm
dithiothreitol (dtt), ph 7.5 at 40c. tnc was eluted from 0.35
to 0.5 m nacl. the purity of the protein was determined by its
mobility on 15% polyacrylamide 0.1% sds gels (laemmli,
1970). to reduce calcium contamination of the protein, it was
dialysed against 50 mm tris, 1 mm egta, 0.5 mm dtt at ph
8.5 and finally into milli-q water containing 1 mm dtt, and
freeze dried.
tnc concentration was determined from its absorbance at
276 nm after subtraction of the absorbance at 320 nm due to
light scattering by use of mr 18,500 and extinction coefficient
of 0.3 cm2 mg'- (szynkiewicz et al., 1985).
crude tntm was prepared from beef heart by ammonium
sulphate precipitation of an extract from an acetone powder
of myofibrils (stull & buss, 1977). the purified material was
diluted 2 fold in glycerol and stored at -200c.

preparation offluorescently labelled troponin i in the
troponin-tropomyosin complex
crude tntm was dialysed free of  xxxd26xxx  with a
large excess of buffer. protein (40-60pm) in kci (30mm),
mops (10mm) at ph 7.0 was labelled at a cysteine residue by
addition of 4-(n-iodoacetoxyethyl-n-methyl)-7-nitrobenz-2oxa-1,3- xxxd3045xxx  (ianbd) in ethanol (460-6pm final
concentration) at 40c in the dark. the reaction with ianbd
was terminated after 6 h by addition of 10 fold excess of dtt
followed by extensive dialysis in the dark against kci
(100mm), mops (10mm), dtt (0.1 mm) at ph 7.0. the
resulting suspension was clarified by centrifugation (trybus &

taylor, 1980).
the extent of labelling was determined from the spectrum
of the reacted protein after dialysis, with extinction coefficients
of e278mgml - = 0.38 for tntm and e480mm = 25 for

ianbd. the low degree of labelling (0.27 and 0.41 mol mol -1
tntm) found for two preparations was expected as conditions
were chosen to label only one of the two cysteine groups on
tni (leszyk et al., 1988). the localisation of the label on tni
was confirmed by running samples of the modified protein on
sds polyacrylamide gels (15%) (trybus & taylor, 1980) and
comparing the position of fluorescent and protein bands.

kinetic methods
transient measurements were carried out in a hi-tech

(salisbury, uk) stopped flow instrument with a dead time of
3.0ms, at 15'c. the rate constants of ca2+ dissociation from
tnc were measured directly by use of the fluorescent chelator

2-[[2-bis(carboxymethyl)]-amino-5-methylphenoxy] - methyl] 6-methoxy-8-bis(carboxymethyl)]-aminoquinoline, quin-2
(rosenfeld & taylor, 1985a). ca" depleted tnc (20pm) was
mixed with an excess of quin-2 (480pm). excitation was from
a xenon lamp (wotan 150 w/s or equivalent) and the incident beam passed through a monochromator at 339 nm (5 nm
band pass). the increase in fluorescence as calcium bound to
quin-2 was monitored at 900 to the incident beam with a
455 nm cut-off filter. measurements of the rate of ca2 + release
over a three fold range of quin-2 concentrations (80-240,pm
final) gave similar results. control experiments in which ca2 +
was mixed with quin-2 indicated that ca2" binding to the
chelator occurred in the dead time of the instrument.
the rate constants of ca2+ dissociation from the tntm
complex were measured with quin-2 as above. the fluorescence of ianbd-labelled tni within the tntm complex was
monitored with excitation at 490nm and a 500nm cut off
filter. the fluorescence decreased with time as ianbd-tntm
(2.6,um) was mixed with excess egta (20mm) to chelate the
released ca2 .
the rate of ca2+ release from the quin-2 ca2+ complex
on mixing with 20 mm egta was determined, in the presence
of excess quin-2, to be 32.5 s'- at 15°c. this is similar to the
value determined by rosenfeld & taylor (1985a) for edta.
this rate was not affected by the compounds used in the

study.
in experiments where compounds were present, they were
preincubated with tnc or tntm for 15min at room temperature before being loaded into the stop flow.
binding of ca2+ to quin-2 is accompanied by an increase
in fluorescence on excitation at 339 nm and a smaller decrease
in fluorescence on excitation at 380 nm (grynkiewicz et al.,
1985). since some of the compounds to be tested show considerable absorbance at 339 nm, the excitation wavelength for
quin-2 fluorescence, the light available to excite fluorescence
in the assay was frequently reduced in the presence of the test
compound (inner filter effect). to avoid this problem, fluorescence can be excited at a longer wavelength (380 nm). this was
done for drugs such as pimobendan and sulmazole and the
decrease in fluorescence of quin-2 on release of ca2+ from
tnc was monitored. control experiments showed that the
rates of ca2+ release from tnc determined at either wave-

length in the absence of drug were the same. the rates of chelation of ca2+ by egta from the quin-2 ca2 + complex were

identical when monitored either at 339 nm or at 380 nm.
however, the signal observed as ca2+ was released from
tnc and bound to quin-2 was smaller for excitation at
380 nm (about 2.5 fold reduction), compared to that with excitation at 339 nm. therefore for experiments at 380 nm, the slit
width was increased to 1 nm and the voltage on the photomultiplier tube was adjusted to obtain approximately the same
size signal at either excitation wavelength.

drugs
drugs used were pimobendan (ud-cg 115) and sulmazole
(ar-l 115), kindly provided by karl thomae, isomazole generously donated by eli lilly and oxmetidine (sk&f 92994).

mechanism of cardiac ca2+ sensitisers

 xxxd318xxx  and  xxxd2884xxx  were obtained from sigma chemical
corp.
data collection and analysis were by standard methods.
two hundred 12 bit data points were collected per record.
four or more data traces were averaged, after the traces
which showed obvious artefacts were discarded and the averaged traces fitted. the fluorescence change has an exponential
time-dependence of the type i(t) = ie-t where k is the rate of
ca2 + release and i is the fluorescence at time t. for ca2 +
release from sites with two off rates, the time dependence was
fitted to using two exponential terms. a simplex algorithm
was used in an iterative process to minimise the deviation of
the data from the theoretical curve by adjustment of the
chosen parameters. for a satisfactory fit, a residual plot
showing the deviation of the data from the fitted curve indicated that the residuals were randomly distributed.

results
measurement of dissociation of ca2 + from  xxxg2307xxx 
the rate of dissociation of ca2+ from tnc was measured by
monitoring the increase in fluorescence on mixing with
quin-2. the transient collected over 100ms was biphasic and
fitted to a double exponential equation. in the example shown
in figure la, the solid line through the data corresponds to
two rates of 162s-1 and 1.6s-1. the rate of the slower
process was determined more accurately to be 0.6s1 by collection of data for longer times (5 s, figure ib).

isomazole (50pm),  xxxd2884xxx  (50 or 100ym),  xxxd318xxx  (25 pm)

and oxmetidine (100pm) on the rate of ca2+ dissociation from
tnc were tested in similar experiments. the results are shown
in table 1. in some cases, the spectroscopic properties of the
compounds themselves limited the maximum concentration
which could be tested. data for sulmazole and pimobendan
were collected with excitation at 380 nm.
as shown in table 1, sulmazole, isomazole and  xxxd2884xxx 
at final concentrations of 50um had no effect on the rate of
ca2+ dissociation from the low affinity site of tnc. the rate
of dissociation was slightly reduced by pimobendan (- 20% at
50 or 100pum) and was somewhat increased by oxmetidine
(- 30% at 100pm).
only  xxxd318xxx  had a major effect on the rate of dissociation
of ca2+ from the low affinity ca2+ binding site.  xxxd318xxx 
(25 pm) reduced the rate of dissociation by 50%. this
increased affinity of the regulatory site for ca2+ occurred
without any significant change in the affinity of the ca2`/
mg2 + high affinity sites.
sulmazole, isomazole,  xxxd2884xxx  or pimobendan (5oum)
also had no effect on the rate of ca2+ dissociation from these
ca2+/mg2+ sites. oxmetidine caused a slight decrease in dissociation rate (24%).
jaquet & heilmeyer (1987) have suggested that dimerization of cardiac tnc occurs over the range 5-lopm under
essentially similar conditions to those used here. dimerized
protein has a lower ca2 + affinity than the monomeric protein
as determined by measurements of ca2+ binding, with the
apparent ca2+ affinity of tnc decreasing three fold over this
range of protein concentration. if this were due to effects on
the low affinity site, the ca2+ off-rate from this site would be
expected to be increased at high protein concentration. we
measured the rate of ca2 + dissociation from tnc over a wide
concentration range (1o-604um tnc final). there was no
increase in the rate of dissociation from the low affinity site
(< 10%) and at most a 25% increase in the rate of dissociation
from the high affinity sites. the extent of dimerization of the
protein would be expected to range from 24% to >85%
dimers, over this range of tnc concentration.
jaquet & heilmeyer (1987) suggested that drugs which alter
the extent of dimerization of tnc would cause an apparent

alteration in the calcium affinity of the protein. since the
effects of any dimerization of the protein on its ca2" affinity
appear small under our conditions, we have not investigated
this further.

measurement of dissociation of ca2+ from troponin
tropomyosin complex
measurements of ca2 + dissociation from sites in tntm
complex were made to identify ca2+ sensitisers which do not
act on tnc directly and to determine the effects of proteinprotein interactions on the drug protein complex.
the rate of dissociation of ca2+ from the tntm complex
was measured from the increase in fluorescence on mixing
with excess quin-2 (figure 2a). the solid line through the
data is a fit to a single exponential equation with a rate of
23s-1, corresponding to dissociation from the low affinity
site. fluorescence transients collected for 5s (data not shown)
showed a slower process at 1.2s-1 corresponding to dissociation of ca2+ from the high affinity sites. thus, the ca2+
binding properties of the high affinity sites of cardiac tnc are
not affected by incorporation into the tntm complex,
whereas the rate of release from the low affinity site is reduced
some 10 fold. similar effects have been shown for skeletal tnc
(rosenfeld & taylor, 1986b).
measurement of ca2 + release from tntm by chelation with
quin-2, as described above, gave data that were difficult to
analyse, particularly when drugs were present. it was unclear
whether this was due to the optical or biochemical properties
of the system. to overcome this problem, the rates of dissociation of ca2+ were measured by monitoring the changes in

fluorescence of ianbd on tni incorporated into the tntm
complex (trybus & taylor, 1980). the large change in fluorescence on ca2+ release from the complex and the low fluorescence background make this a sensitive technique. none of
the compounds tested absorbs at the excitation wavelength of
ianbd (490 nm).
to determine whether the fluorescent modification of tni
with ianbd altered the ca2 + binding properties of the
tntm complex into which it was incorporated, the rate of
dissociation of ca2+ from the fluorescently labelled complex
was also measured as described above. the increase in fluorescence of the calcium chelator and indicator on release of
ca2+ from the complex is shown in figure 2b. the solid line
through the data corresponds to a rate of 22s-1 for ca2+
release from the low affinity site. fluorescence transients collected for longer times (data not shown) showed a slower
process at 0.9 s 1 corresponding to dissociation from the high
affinity sites. these values are the same as those found for the
unmodified protein complex under the same conditions.
hence the ca2+ binding properties of the tntm complex are
not modified by fluorescently-labelling the tni.
in parallel experiments, the fluorescence of ianbd was
monitored (figure 3) as ca2+ was released from the labelled
tntm by mixing with excess chelator egta. the solid line
through the data corresponds to a fit to a double exponential
equation with rates of 22s- ' and 1.8s- 1. these rates are the
same as those of ca2+ release monitored in the experiment
described above, and indicate that the probe on tni measures
ca2+ release from the low and high affinity sites of tnc
within the tntm complex. in contrast, the fluorescence
changes of ianbd-labelled skeletal tni incorporated into
skeletal tntm occur only on ca2 + release from the low affinity ca2 + sites of the tnc component of the complex
(rosenfeld & taylor, 1985b).
figure 4 shows data from a stopped flow experiment in
which changes in fluorescence of ianbd labelled tni within
the tntm complex were measured as ca2 + was released from
the complex on mixing with excess egta (10 mm final).
figure 4a shows a control trace. the solid line through the
data is the fit to two exponential terms giving two rates
12.7 s- and 1.4 s- for the release from the low and high
affinity ca2+ sites respectively. figure 4b shows a trace from
the same experiment in the presence of 50um  xxxd2884xxx ,
which can be fitted to give two rates of 6.5 s- 1 and 0.9 s' for
the release from the low and high affinity ca2 + sites respectively.

the rates of ca2 + release from the tntm complex labelled
with ianbd on tni have been measured in the presence of a
number of compounds shown to be 'calcium sensitisers'. the
results are shown in table 2. sulmazole and pimobendan
(501um) were without effect on the rate of dissociation of ca2 +
from the regulatory site in the protein complex and isomazole
(5opm) caused only a slight reduction (-20%). none of these
compounds modified the rate of ca2 + release from the high
affinity sites.  xxxd2884xxx  (5oum) or  xxxd318xxx  (10pm) reduced

the aim of the work described here was to develop new assays
which would pinpoint the sites of action of ca2+ sensitisers
within the tntm complex.
the interaction of ca2+ with ca2+ binding proteins is generally considered to be fast and to occur at rates approaching
those for diffusion limited bimolecular reaction. if this is so, it
is unlikely that the rate of ca2+ binding to tnc will be
altered by the presence of a ca2 + sensitiser. hence, the change
in ca2 + affinity expected for a ca2 + sensitiser will result from
a reduction in the rate of release of ca2+.
in practice the binding step is too fast to measure and a
subsequent conformational change in the protein could occur,
but itself be too fast to be detected (rosenfeld & taylor,
1985a). of course in this case it is possible that the presence of
bound drug could change the rate of this subsequent conformational change. if this is so, any change in ca2+ release rate
that we measure will not completely reflect the overall change
in ca2 + affinity of the protein.
it is difficult to extrapolate directly from changes in force
production of skinned muscle fibres caused by ca2+ sensitisers to estimate the increased ca2 + affinity expected.
however, it seems probable that the reduction in rate of ca2 +
release from tnc or tntm will be small. this method of
direct measurement of the rate of ca2+ release from tnc
cannot resolve changes of less than 20% accurately. this is of
sufficient accuracy to detect changes of ca2+ off-rate likely to
be of pharmacological significance. for example, the change
in ca2+ affinity of the regulatory site of cardiac tnc caused
by calmidazolium (el saleh & solaro, 1987) could correspond
to a decrease in ca2" off-rate from 240s-' to 100s-1, which
would be detected in our experiments.
the method used to measure the rate of ca2+ release from
tntm has a higher signal to noise ratio and hence better
resolution.
we began by testing the effects of a range of known ca2+
sensitisers on the rates of ca2+ release from cardiac tnc and
tntm. for some compounds, such as sulmazole and pimobendan, their effects on ca2+ release could not explain their
effects in vivo and in vitro.
(i) sulmazole (ar-l 115) is a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme
type iii inhibitor with additional inotropic effects (ahn et al.,
1986) attributed to a direct effect on myofibrils (solaro &
ruegg, 1982). in the presence of sulmazole, the ca2 +dependence of myofibrillar atpase activity is shifted such
that there is an increase in activity at submaximal ca2+ concentrations and increased ca2+ binding to the myofibrils.
more recent evidence suggests that the ca2 + sensitising
properties of sulmazole are stereospecific, whereas the other
inotropic effects due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase and
na+-k+ atpase activity and other additional mechanisms of
action are not (van meel et al., 1988). the present experiments, with the racemate, show that sulmazole (50#m) does
not increase the ca2 + affinity of isolated tnc or tntm
complex. however, it may act on some other component of
the contractile apparatus in vivo to produce a ca2 + sensitising
effect.

(ii) pimobendan (ud-cg 115 bs) has been shown to have
ca2+ sensitising effects on skinned cardiac preparations from
guinea-pig and dog, and human papillary muscle (ruegg et al.,
1984; fritsche et al., 1986; fujino et al., 1988a). these effects
are mainly due to the l-isomer (fujino et al., 1988b). the
racemic mixture is without effect on myofibrillar atpase

activity at concentrations up to 100pm. however, measurements of ca2" binding to skinned dog fibres show that it
increases the affinity of the regulatory ca2+ binding sites by
two to three fold at 501um and decreases the affinity of the
ca2"/mg2 + sites by about 20%.
here we have looked at the effects of pimobendan on the
isolated contractile proteins. we found that the rate of ca2+
release from the regulatory site of bovine cardiac tnc was
slightly decreased in the presence of racemic pimobendan. the
rate of ca2+ release from the high affinity sites was not

changed.
we have failed to confirm the observation that pimobendan
decreases the overall ca2+ affinity of bovine tnc (jaquet &
heilmeyer, 1987). we also found that pimobendan had no
effect on the rate of ca2 + release from either low or high affinity sites of tntm.
thus, there is a difference in the effects of pimobendan on
the ca2+ affinity of dog cardiac fibres and on the bovine isolated proteins. this may be due to a difference in the action of
pimobendan in different species. such a difference in inotropic
effects of the demethylated metabolite of pimobendan
ud-cg-212 cl, has been observed (shibasaki & endoh,
1987). alternatively, pimobendan may have specific effects
only on the regulatory complex as it functions in vivo.
in contrast to our observations with sulmazole and pimobendan, the ca2 + sensitising effects of some compounds could
be explained by their effects on tnc and tntm.
(iii) isomazole (ly-175326) is one of a series of compounds
designed around sulmazole, which has been shown to be a
potent inotrope in some species including man (lues et al.,
1988), with a ca2+ sensitising action on skinned fibres. our
observations show that the ca2+ sensitising effect of isomazole may be due to its action on tntm to increase the
ca2 + affinity of the regulatory site of tnc. we show that isomazole does not act directly on isolated tnc.
calmodulin is another key ca2+ binding protein (cheung,
1980), which is highly homologous with tnc. the effects of a
number of compounds known to bind to calmodulin were
tested to determine whether they modified ca2" binding to
tnc or tntm.
(iv) calmodulin antagonists, such as  xxxd2884xxx  and calmidazolium have been shown to stimulate myofibrillar atpase
activity at submaximal ca2 + concentrations (silver et al.,
1985). the concentrations giving 50% stimulation at 2pmm
ca2+ were found to be 909m  xxxd2884xxx  or 9,um calmidazolium.  xxxd2884xxx  causes an increase not only in myofibrillar
atpase rate at submaximal ca2+ but also an increase in
basal atpase in the absence of ca1+ (silver et al., 1985;
smith & england, 1989). here we have found that  xxxd2884xxx 
(5om) reduced the rate of dissociation of ca2+ from the
tntm complex, affecting both types of site. surprisingly, in
view of the high degree of homology between calmodulin and
tnc,  xxxd2884xxx  had no effect on the ca2+ affinity of tnc
alone. in contrast, calmidazolium, another calmodulin
antagonist, does have the expected direct effect to increase the
ca2 + affinity of the low affinity ca2 + site on cardiac troponin
c (ctnc) (el-saleh & solaro, 1987). possible sites of action of
 xxxd2884xxx  within the tntm complex are being investigated
further.
 xxxd318xxx , another calmodulin antagonist has been shown to
increase both the ca2 + sensitivity of dog heart myofibrillar
atpase and ca2 + binding to ctnc (solaro et al., 1986). the
decrease in rate of release of ca2+ from the regulatory low
affinity site observed here correlates well with an overall 4 fold

increase in the total ca2 + affinity of ctnc in the presence of
100pm  xxxd318xxx  observed by these authors.  xxxd318xxx  also
decreased the rate of release of ca2 + from the low affinity site
in tntm, as expected from its action on tnc.  xxxd318xxx  had
little effect on the rate of release of the ca2 + from the high
affinity sites of tnc alone. however, when tnc was incorporated in the tntm complex, this rate was decreased.
oxmetidine, an h2-receptor antagonist, binds to calmodulin and to skeletal muscle tnc (reid, 1986 and personal
communication). however, its effects on the rates of ca2 +
release from the low affinity site and high affinity sites of
cardiac tnc are the opposite of those that are expected of a
compound acting as a ca2 + sensitiser. indeed, there are no
data showing that it is cardiotonic.

the design of more specific ca2 + sensitisers
the aim of the work described here was to develop new assays
which would accurately pinpoint the sites of action of ca2 +
sensitisers. however, from the data presented it is apparent
that a number of compounds which are 'calcium sensitisers' in
vivo do not appear to modify the ca2+ affinity of the tntm
complex in vitro. this may be because the compounds act by
some other mechanism in vivo. another possibility must be
considered. the available assays, including those developed
here, may fail to predict 'ca2 + sensitisers' because the model
systems lack the mechanical coupling of the muscle.
the ca2+ affinity of tnc is itself determined by the nature
of crossbridge interactions within the thin filament (actin and
the regulatory proteins). actively-cycling crossbridges are
expected to increase the ca2+ affinity of the ca2 + specific
site(s) of tnc (hill, 1984), although the effect may not be
large. an indirect estimate indicated a 10 fold increase in the
apparent ca2 + affinity of the tnc complex, as skeletal muscle
fibres went from a relaxed to a fully contracted state (guth &
potter, 1987). however, these experiments relied on changes in
the fluorescence of modified tnc incorporated into skinned
fibres to measure changes in ca2+ affinity of that protein.
direct measurement of ca2+ binding to active fibres failed to
confirm this change in affinity (pan & solaro, 1987), suggesting that the effect of mechanical activity on the ca2 + affinity
of tn is probably not large.
identifying the target protein is the key step that will allow
rational drug design of more specific ca2 + sensitisers. the
methods developed in this study provide information on
where the compounds bind within the myofibril and can be
extended to the complexes of tnc-tni and tnc-tni-tnt.
this will allow more precise pinpointing of the location of the
drug binding site. the next step is the characterization of the
binding site by developing a structure-activity relationship.
for tnc which has a suitably low molecular weight, we have
been able to investigate the  xxxd318xxx  binding site in some detail
by use of 'h-n.m.r. and the 3d structures of the homologous
proteins, skeletal tnc and calmodulin (smith et al., 1988).
the approaches described here provide in vitro assays to
develop new compounds which interact with the different
components of tntm to increase the affinity for ca2 . it
remains to be seen whether such compounds are ca2 + sensitisers in vivo.
