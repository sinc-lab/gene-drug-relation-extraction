trypanosomatid protozoans of the genus leishmania are the
causative agent of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease with a
prevalence of 12 million cases in 88 countries and a worldwide
incidence of 1.5–2 million cases per year (1). pentavalent antimony remains the primary drug used for treatment of clinical
disease, although it has several drawbacks. antimonial treatments are expensive, inactive when administered orally, re-

quire long courses of high dose treatment to be effective, and
exhibit toxicity in proportion to dose and duration of treatment,
and there are reports of the emergence of drug-resistant parasites (2). thus, there is an urgent need for improved methods of
chemotherapy.
one approach for the identification of prospective drug targets in leishmania has been the study of drug-resistant parasites generated in the laboratory. as in other organisms, drug
resistance frequently involves modifications of the gene encoding the primary drug target, such as mutations, rearrangements, or amplifications. in leishmania, gene amplification
often is observed following stepwise selection for drug resistance, as the small size of the parasite genome facilitates the
visualization of amplified dna (3–5). analysis of amplified
dnas has led to the identification of the genes encoding  xxxg631xxx - xxxg2366xxx  (dhfr-ts) and
pteridine reductase (ptr1), members of the p-glycoprotein superfamily (pgpa and  xxxg10xxx ),  xxxg1626xxx , and
n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, among others (see refs. 4 – 8
for reviews and references). in addition to amplifications, cells
obtained by stepwise drug selection frequently exhibit multiple
resistance mechanisms. for example, leishmania selected for
resistance to the antifolate methotrexate (mtx)1 usually exhibit alterations in mtx uptake and less commonly amplification of dhfr-ts and ptr1, and rarely, point mutations in
dhfr-ts, singly or in various combinations (4 – 6, 8 –13). even
when drug resistance via gene amplification is a viable resistance mechanism, its frequency of occurrence is relatively low in
leishmania (less than 1027) (4). once induced, amplifications
can be displaced by other mechanisms, depending on experimental variables such as the length of time in culture and
selective drug concentration. thus, the stochastic and occasionally transient occurrence of gene amplification limits its general utility in recovering potential drug resistance loci.
in this report we describe a more directed approach toward
the identification of genes whose overexpression leads to drug
resistance in leishmania. this takes advantage of recent advances in our ability to manipulate genetically this parasite by
transfection of functional multicopy episomal dnas (14 –16).
we applied a “multicopy suppression” technique to the identification of drug resistance genes in leishmania, similar to
those previously performed in yeast and prokaryotes (17). in
this approach, a library of transfected parasites is created, each
bearing a different 30 – 40-kb segment of the parasite genome
inserted into the escherichia coli-leishmania shuttle cosmid

we tested a general method for the identification of
drug resistance loci in the trypanosomatid protozoan
parasite leishmania major. genomic libraries in a multicopy episomal cosmid vector were transfected into
susceptible parasites, and drug selections of these transfectant libraries yielded parasites bearing cosmids mediating resistance. tests with two antifolates led to the
recovery of cosmids encoding dhfr-ts or ptr1, two
known resistance genes. overexpression/selection using
the toxic nucleoside tubercidin similarly yielded the
tor (toxic nucleoside resistance) locus, as well as a new
locus (tub2) conferring collateral hypersensitivity to
allopurinol. leishmania synthesize ergosterol rather
than cholesterol, making this pathway attractive as a
chemotherapeutic target. overexpression/selection using the sterol synthesis inhibitors  xxxd3314xxx  (tbf, targeting  xxxg2197xxx ) and itraconazole (itz, targeting lanosterol c14-demethylase) yielded nine new
resistance loci. several conferred resistance to both
drugs; several were drug-specific, and two tbf-resistant cosmids induced hypersensitivity to itz. one tbfresistant cosmid encoded  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  (sqs1),
which is located upstream of the sites of tbf and itz
action in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. this suggests that resistance to “downstream” inhibitors can be
mediated by increased expression of ergosterol biosynthetic intermediates. our studies establish the feasibility of overexpression/selection in parasites and suggest
that many leishmania drug resistance loci are amenable to identification in this manner.

isolation of leishmania drug resistance genes

vector clhyg (18). since expression of the passenger leishmania sequences from episomes occurs autonomously and is related to the copy number, genes carried by clhyg should be
overexpressed. in effect, these segments of leishmania dna
are “pre-amplified,” and drug pressure on such transfected
parasite libraries should yield cosmids directly conferring drug
resistance.
here we tested the overexpression/selection approach with
two drugs known to yield resistance via gene amplification in
leishmania, mtx, and tubercidin, and we showed that overexpression/selection successfully yielded loci previously detected. we then probed a parasite metabolic pathway not previously studied molecularly in leishmania, that of sterol
biosynthesis. as in fungi, leishmania synthesizes ergosterol
rather than cholesterol as its bulk membrane sterol (19), and
this shift similarly offers great potential for selective chemotherapy as well as the study of the evolution of biochemical
pathways.
experimental procedures

results

a test of overexpression/selection: mtx resistance—methotrexate-resistant leishmania frequently exhibit amplification
of either the dhfr-ts or ptr1 genes (4 – 8). we asked
whether selection of cosmid-transfected l. major libraries
would yield these two loci, and/or perhaps others. two leishmania cosmid transfectant libraries were used: a v1 library in
friedlin strain a1, containing 17,900 independent cosmid
transfectants, and an lv39cl5 library in strain lv39cl79, containing 3,600 independent transfectants (approximately 1000
cosmids constitute a “1-hit” library for leishmania; ref. 18).
106 cells from either transfectant library were plated on progressively increasing concentrations of mtx, and the number
of colonies was compared with that of a control consisting of
parental or clhyg-transfected a1 or lv39cl79 (table i).
the a1 line was inhibited by mtx with an ec50 of 0.2 mm in
 xxxd1728xxx  culture medium (table ii). platings with a1 control
parasites yielded colonies up to 3 mm mtx but not on 6 mm or
higher concentrations of mtx (table i, part a). in contrast, the
a1 cosmid library transfectant pool yielded 250 colonies on 6
mm mtx and continued to yield colonies up to 24 mm mtx

parasites, culture, and transfection—leishmania major strain
friedlin v1 (referred to as v1) is a virulent clonal derivative of the
friedlin line (mhom/il/80/friedlin), whereas friedlin a1 (a1) is a
clonal avirulent line derived from the friedlin line after multiple passages in vitro (20); both were obtained from d. l. sacks (national
institutes of health). l. major strain lv39 clone 5 (lv39cl5) is a
virulent clonal derivative of the lv39 strain (mrho/su/59/p), whereas
lv39 clone 79 (lv39cl79) is an avirulent clonal derivative obtained
after chemical mutagenesis; both were obtained from r. titus (colorado
state university). cells were grown in  xxxd1728xxx  medium, which contained
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (14). parasites were transfected by electroporation, and clonal lines were obtained by plating on
 xxxd1728xxx  semisolid media (14) containing 40 mg/ml hygromycin b (hygb)
for recovery of cosmid transfectants. for transfection of cosmid library
dna we used 14 – 40 mg dna per transfection, and colonies from
multiple transfections were pooled (21).
to identify cosmid-bearing lines exhibiting drug resistance, 106 control or cosmid library-transfected cells were plated on 100-mm  xxxd1728xxx 
plates, containing increasing concentrations of the selective drug of
interest. macroscopic colonies were counted after 10 –15 days of incubation and recovered into  xxxd1728xxx  medium.
selective drugs—allopurinol, inosine dialdehyde, mtx, tubercidin,
and the pteridine o/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine) were obtained from sigma. sandoz pharmaceutical generously provided tbf.
itz was purchased from the jansen research foundation.
cosmid libraries—three libraries containing 30 – 40-kb inserts of l.
major genomic dna were constructed in the e. coli-leishmania shuttle
vector clhyg, using either shear (v1) or sau3a partial digestion
(lv39cl5, v1) to prepare the genomic dna inserts (18). cosmid library
dna was prepared by sds/alkali lysis followed by  xxxd2982xxx 
precipitation (18, 21). transfection of the v1 cosmid library into friedlin a1 line yielded 17,900 independent transfectants (10,600 from
friedlin v1 sau3a partial-digestion library and 7,300 from friedlin v1
shear library). transfection of lv39cl5 cosmid library dnas into
lv39cl79 yielded 3,600 independent transfectants.
analysis of drug resistance—prior to tests of drug resistance, we
increased the cosmid copy number within transfectants with elevated
aminoglycoside treatment (14). primary transfectants were selected in
a stepwise manner, beginning at 125 mg of hygb/ml and progressing
through four 1:10 passages into 250 and 500 mg/ml and, in some cases,
to 1 mg/ml. transfectants containing fragments cloned in psnbr (22)
were similarly selected for resistance to 32 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx .
for determination of drug sensitivity, parasites were inoculated into
 xxxd1728xxx  media (1 ml in 24-well microtiter plates or 10 ml in t25 culture
flasks) lacking hygb and containing the test drug, at a starting concentration of 2 3 105 cells/ml. parasite numbers were determined using
a coulter counter (model zbi) after 2–3 days of incubation at 26 °c.
the effective concentration for 50% inhibition (ec50) was defined as
that drug concentration that resulted in a 50% decrease in cell number,
measured at the time when control cultures lacking drug had reached
late log phase (typically less than 107/ml; ref. 11). statistical tests for
drug resistance utilized the parameter fold resistance, defined as the
average ratio of the experimental cell line ec50 to that of the parental
control line measured in the same experiment, over n independent
experiments (11).

molecular techniques—general molecular methods were performed
as described (10, 14, 16). genomic dna enriched for cosmid dna was
recovered from 3 3 107 cultured leishmania cells by an alkaline/sds
lysis protocol followed by  xxxd2982xxx  precipitation (18, 21), and
cosmids were recovered by transformation into e. coli dh5a. cosmid
fragments were cloned in the leishmania shuttle vector psnbr (22),
and pcr products were cloned in the vector pgem-t (promega).
leishmania chromosomes were prepared in agarose plugs, separated
by pulse field gel electrophoresis using a bio-rad chef mapper,
stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to nylon membranes
(23). gene-specific hybridization probes were made by pcr using l.
major dna template and the following primers: sqs1, a 0.3-kb pcr
product obtained with primers smb75 (59-gacac(g/c)(g/c)t(g/
c)ga(a/g)ga(t/c)ga(t/c)atg) and smb76 (59-cc(g/c)gcgta(a/
g)ta(a/g)tg(a/g)ca(a/g)ta); dhfr-ts, a 0.3-kb pcr amplification
product obtained with the primers 59-ctggcgccgctgccggagg
and 59-ctctagaggtaccatatgtccagggcagctgcga (lowercase letters
represent bases not present in the genome); ptr1, a 0.9-kb pcr product obtained with primers 59-gcggatcccatatgactgctccgacc and
59-ggcggatcctcaggcccgggtaaggctgta; and  xxxg10xxx , a 0.4-kb
product obtained with the primers pc01 (59-ttctc(t/c)gg(g/c)(g/
t)c(g/t)tc(t/c)gggtgcggcaag) and pc02 (59-gtc(g/c)ag(g/
c)gc(g/t)ct(g/c)gt(t/c)gcctc(g/c)tc). the tor probe was the
leishmania dna insert from plasmid ptub/sb9 (24). fragments were
excised from agarose gels following electrophoresis, purified by glass
milk (geneclean ii; bio 101, inc.), labeled with [a-32p]dctp by random
priming, and used as hybridization probes. with cosmid probes, weak
hybridization to the 500-kb chromosome recognized by dhfr-ts flanking sequences present in the clhyg vector occurred (18) and served as
an internal reference standard.
pcr—standard pcr was performed using a “hot start” protocol of 10
min at 98 °c, followed by 10 min at 90 °c, the addition of 1 unit of taq
polymerase (roche molecular biochemicals), and 30 cycles consisting of
1 min at 94 °c, 2 min at 55 °c, and 3 min at 72 °c, followed by one 7-min
elongation at 72 °c. a “touchdown” pcr (25) used a varying annealing
temperature, decreasing 1 °c every third cycle from 60 °c to a touchdown at 50 °c. the protocol consisted of a total of 30 cycles of 1 min at
94 °c, 2 min at temperatures decreasing from 60 to 50 °c, and 3 min at
72 °c, followed by 10 cycles with an annealing temperature fixed at
50 °c. degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of squalene cyclase (erg7),  xxxg2197xxx  ( xxxg1246xxx   xxxg2197xxx ), acetyl-coa thiolase
(erg10), and lanosterol c14-demethylase (erg11) were used in these
studies; details are available from the authors. with the squalene
cyclase primers, a product was obtained with ctbf5 template. however
its sequence showed high similarity (p , 10228) to a large family of
serine-threonine protein phosphatases (pp1s; laboratory strain 2783;
genbanktm af068751).
sequence of sqs1—a 3-kb psti fragment of cosmid citz4 was identified by southern blot analysis with the sqs1 probe, and this was
subcloned into the pucp vector for sequencing using taquenase 2.0
(amersham pharmacia biotech) and gene-specific primers. the sqs1
sequence was deposited in genbanktm (u30455).

(table i, part a). the lv39cl79 line of l. major was more
susceptible to inhibition by mtx, with an ec50 of 0.003 mm
(table ii). the basis for this difference with the friedlin a1
line, or the cc-1 line studied previously (10), is unknown.
platings with lv39cl79 control parasites yielded colonies up to
a concentration of 0.08 mm but not thereafter, whereas the
lv39cl79 cosmid library transfectant pool yielded colonies at
concentrations up to 0.32 mm (table i, part b).
the cosmids within colonies showing differential mtx survival in the a1 and lv39cl79 transfectant library platings were
recovered and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, pcr
with specific primers, and southern blot hybridization with
dhfr-ts or ptr1 probes. ten different cosmids were obtained, four containing dhfr-ts, and six containing ptr1
(table iii). both loci were recovered from each library, and
there was no correlation between the locus recovered and the
selective drug concentration applied.
to confirm the functionality of the recovered cosmids, several were transfected into a1 and lv39cl79 (table ii). in a1,
all cosmids gave mtx resistance, ranging from 6-fold for the
ptr1 cosmids to 7–23-fold for the dhfr-ts cosmids. the
variation observed probably reflects differences in the flanking
sequences, which could affect expression and/or copy number.
similarly, all cosmids gave mtx resistance when transfected
into lv39cl79, although the fold resistance values were elevated (1500-fold for most ptr1 cosmids and 350-fold for the
dhfr-ts cosmids) due to the sensitivity of the parental line.
the ec50 values for the lv39cl79 transfectants were to those
seen with the a1 transfectants, suggesting that they were
comparably active.
we performed a similar selection with another antifolate,
o/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine). from these experiments, a total of 31 colonies showing differential survival
were analyzed, from which 5 different cosmids were obtained
(table iii). as for mtx, all cosmids contained either ptr1 or
dhfr-ts, and several of these cosmids were indistinguishable
from those recovered with mtx (table iii).

these data showed that the overexpression/selection strategy recovered the two loci known to confer mtx resistance
following gene amplification in leishmania. encouraged by
these findings, we proceeded to test the overexpression/selection strategy for several other classes of drugs with known or
potential utility in leishmania chemotherapy.
toxic nucleosides—tubercidin (7-deaza-adenosine; tub) is
a toxic  xxxd2705xxx  used previously to generate drugresistant leishmania. tubr mutants of l. donovani show loss
of  xxxg79xxx  or decreased tubercidin uptake (26, 27),
whereas tubr mutants in l. mexicana show a dramatic decrease in nucleoside uptake, induced by amplification of the
gene tor (toxic nucleoside resistance) (24, 28).
in platings of the a1 cosmid transfectant library on increasing concentrations of tubercidin, 39 colonies showing differential survival were obtained, from which three different cosmids
were recovered (table iii). southern blot analysis showed that
the ctub1a and ctub1b cosmids were related and contained
tor, whereas the remaining cosmid did not contain tor nor
any other locus studied in this work. following transfection
into a1, the two tor cosmid transfectants showed modest
increases in tub resistance, from 2- to 3.4-fold, and much
higher levels of resistance to inosine dialdehyde (15–22-fold)
and allopurinol (44 – 89-fold; table iv). in l. mexicana, amplification or overexpression of tor yielded high levels of resistance to both tub and inosine dialdehyde (500- and 75-fold
respectively; ref. 24).
the ctub1a and ctub1b cosmids each were recovered from
only a single colony, whereas ctub2 was recovered many times
(table iii). ctub2 cosmid transfectants showed a different resistance profile from that of the tor cosmid transfectants,
exhibiting only a modest level of tub and inosine dialdehyde
resistance (1.6 –1.8-fold) and hypersensitivity to allopurinol
(about 0.7-fold; table iv).
sterol metabolism—we used two inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis to identify prospective resistance loci (fig. 1).  xxxd3314xxx  (tbf) is an allylamine that inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi and leishmania by targeting squalene
epoxidase (29 –31), and itraconazole (itz) is an azole that inhibits a subsequent step, the p450-dependent lanosterol c14demethylase (31–33).
thirty-nine colonies were obtained differentially after plating the a1 cosmid transfectant library on increasing concentrations of tbf, yielding seven cosmids. restriction mapping,
southern blot, and pcr analysis showed that these corresponded to different loci unrelated to each other or to dhfrts, ptr1, tor, ctub2, or  xxxg10xxx  (table iii; data not shown).
twenty-eight colonies were obtained differentially from the
itz selections, yielding four different cosmids unrelated to
each other or the other loci mentioned above (table iii; data
not shown). these 11 cosmids were transfected back into a1
cells to confirm their role in drug resistance.
for the cosmids arising from tbf selection, a low level of
resistance was observed in most transfectants, ranging from
1.4- to 2.5-fold (table v). for all but ctbf5, this low level of
resistance was statistically significant. transfectants were also
tested for cross-resistance to the “downstream” inhibitor itz
(fig. 1). the ctbf1, ctbf3, ctbf6, and ctbf7 transfectants
showed higher resistance to itz than to tbf (2.7– 6.5-fold),
whereas the ctbf2 and ctbf4 transfectants showed modest
hypersensitivity (0.3-fold), and ctbf5 showed no significant
resistance. these results implicated six of these loci in resistance and/or susceptibility to sterol synthesis inhibitors.
for the cosmids arising from itz selection, low level resistance was observed in the transfectants, ranging from 1.3 to

6.1-fold; the resistance conferred by citz3 was not significant
(table v). tests with the “upstream” inhibitor tbf showed a
low level of cross-resistance for transfectants bearing citz2
(1.9-fold).
since many genes involved in sterol biosynthesis have been
isolated from fungi and mammals (34), we used a heterologous
pcr approach based on evolutionarily conserved sequences to
search for several of these in the citz or ctbf cosmids. we
designed degenerate primers based on conserved regions of
 xxxg2197xxx  (the expected target of tbf;  xxxg1246xxx   xxxg2197xxx ), the
p450-dependent lanosterol c14-demethylase (erg11, encoding
the expected target of itz),  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  ( xxxg777xxx ), squalene cyclase (erg7), and acetyl-coa thiolase (erg10). these
were tested using standard or touchdown pcr protocols, using
individual cosmid dnas as well as l. major genomic dna as

templates. most primer pairs failed to yield any specific amplification product with any template.
with  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  primers, an amplification product
was obtained with both genomic dna and citz4 templates. its
sequence showed good homology with  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  genes
from fungi and mammals, and we determined the sequence of
the corresponding region of citz4. an open reading frame of 414
amino acids emerged, whose prospective initiating aug codon
was located 39 of a region that shows a high potential to serve
as the trans-splice acceptor site required for the expression of
functional mrna in leishmania (data not shown). the predicted l. major polypeptide showed 26% amino acid identity
with the  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  proteins of humans and fungi, with
conservation of several regions associated with substrate recognition (fig. 2). this included two aspartate-rich motifs im-

plicated as the binding site for the mg21/mn21-diphosphate
moiety of prenyl substrates (regions i/ii and iii/iv), and the
hydrophobicity of a region implicated in membrane binding
(region vi; refs. 35, 36). the leishmania sequence showed a
much closer relationship to squalene synthases than to phytoene synthases in data base searches, and we termed this gene
 xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  1 (sqs1).
to test whether sqs1 was responsible for itz resistance,
citz4 deletions were made, transfected into a1, and scored for
itz resistance (fig. 3). these studies mapped the itz resistance locus to the 3-kb apai fragment bearing sqs1 (deletions
citz4-h and -h4), whereas loss or disruption of sqs1 resulted
in a loss of itz resistance (citz4-h1 and -h5). as the size of the
cosmid dna insert was progressively reduced, the level of itz
resistance rose, from about 4-fold with citz-4 to about 13-fold
with deletion citz4-h4 (fig. 3). a similar phenomenon was
noted with other drug resistance cosmids,2 perhaps arising
from an increased copy number and/or level of expression from
smaller constructs. the citz4-h4 transfectants remained susceptible to tbf (data not shown). thus, citz4 encodes an enzyme of the sterol biosynthetic pathway,  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx ,
whose expression from a multicopy episome confers resistance
to itz but not tbf.
assignment of cosmid drug resistance loci to leishmania
chromosomes—radiolabeled cosmids were hybridized to chromosomes of the friedlin a1 strain of l. major, separated by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all cosmids identified single
chromosomes (table iii). several different cosmids hybridized
to chromosomes of similar size, such as ctbf1 and ctbf7 (0.8
mb), citz1 and citz4 (1.15 mb), or ctbf5 and citz3 (1.12 mb). we
used southern blot hybridization of the cosmid probes to restriction enzyme-digested chromosomal dna to ask whether
they represented the same locus. in all cases, the patterns
differed considerably (data not shown), suggesting that all
arose from different loci.
discussion

in this study we showed that an overexpression/selection
approach for the identification of drug resistance genes works

well in the protozoan parasite leishmania. we tested this
approach by selecting for antifolate resistance, which when
applied to wild-type parasites frequently leads to the recovery
of lines bearing amplification of either (or both) of two loci,
ptr1 and dhfr-ts (9, 13, 37–39). our strategy similarly led
to recovery of multiple cosmids bearing these two genes, attesting to its efficacy and efficiency. no new loci were identified in
the mtx selection experiments, such as the leishmania genes
ft13 and bt13 which encode the folate/mtx and biopterin/
folate transporters, respectively (40, 41). similar results were
obtained for the antifolate o/129, which inhibits the pteridine
reductase activities of both ptr1 and dhfr-ts (42) and shows
good activity against both developmental stages of l. major.4
these data provide additional genetic evidence for the view
that for both mtx and o/129, the primary targets are the
cellular enzymes dhfr-ts and ptr1 (43).
selection with the toxic nucleoside tub yielded two different
loci. one encoded tor, a gene known to be associated with
tub resistance in leishmania amazonensis (24, 28). the mechanism by which tor overexpression mediates decreased  xxxd2705xxx  uptake is unknown; the predicted tor protein
does not encode a hydrophobic transport protein, and it could
function by down-regulating transporter function (28). transfection of the two tor-containing cosmids yielded a low level of
tub resistance but much higher cross-resistance to the toxic
nucleoside inosine dialdehyde and toxic nucleobase allopurinol.
this pattern of cross-resistance differs considerably from that
seen by tor overexpression in leishmania mexicana and
points to differences among leishmania species in purine uptake pathways, a phenomenon noted in earlier studies (44, 45).
despite the relatively low level of tub resistance conferred by
the tor cosmids in l. major, it was sufficient to lead to their
recovery.
recovery of the cosmid ctub2 identified a second locus for
tub resistance, mediating resistance to both tub and inosine
dialdehyde and hypersensitivity to allopurinol. although the
level of drug resistance was modest, ctub2 was recovered in 37
colonies, whereas tor was recovered in only 2 colonies (table
iii). although there are several possibilities for the mode of
action, we favor one where ctub2 encodes (or up-regulates) a
purine nucleobase transporter activity described previously in
leishmania (28, 46). this model posits that increased purine
uptake from the culture media (containing 100 mm adenine)
would decrease the potency of toxic purine nucleosides and
increase the potency of toxic purine nucleobases, as seen in the
tub2 cosmid transfectant (table iv).
leishmania, unlike mammalian cells, are unable to synthesize purines de novo (47). as purine salvage and interconversions are essential to parasite survival, they are attractive
targets for selective chemotherapy. study of the tor and
tub2 loci may provide information about the mechanisms
used by leishmania for essential purine uptake.
ergosterol biosynthetic genes and drug resistance—bulk
sterol biosynthesis in leishmania and fungi generates ergosterol instead of cholesterol (19), and several antifungal inhibitors targeting this pathway show good activity against leishmania species (48, 49). in fungi, the genes encoding the
enzymes involved ergosterol biosynthesis have been identified
(31). previously no molecular analysis of this pathway had been
undertaken in leishmania.
selection experiments with the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors
tbf and itz yielded a total of 11 unrelated cosmids, 9 of which
showed activity in subsequent tests. these conferred a variety

of resistance patterns (table v) as follows: several conferred
cross-resistance to both tbf and itz (ctbf1, ctbf3, ctbf6,
ctbf7, and citz2), two conferred resistance only to itz (citz1
and citz4), and remarkably, two conferred tbf resistance and
itz hypersensitivity (ctbf2 and ctbf4).
although the level of resistance conferred by the ctbf and
citz cosmids was modest, there are several reasons to be confident that these encode bona fide resistance genes. first, the
level of resistance for nine cosmids was statistically significant
(table v). second, the magnitude of resistance conferred by
transfection of known resistance genes on transfected cosmids
or from endogenous amplifications is often similarly modest.
this was seen for vinblastine-selected  xxxg10xxx  amplifications
(50, 51), primaquine-selected ptr1 (h-region) amplifications
(11, 13), and the tor and sqs1 loci identified here. this may
represent a limitation of the cosmid-based approach, as resistance often increases greatly as irrelevant regions of the transfected construct are removed (fig. 3).5 third, several of the
cosmids were recovered multiply (ctbf3, ctbf4, citz1, and

citz2), as noted earlier for tub2. finally, several cosmids
selected for tbf resistance showed collateral effects with itz,
which would be highly unlikely for irrelevant loci. thus, it is
probable that most of the cosmids identified here contain active
resistance genes, as confirmed for the sqs1 gene borne by
cosmid citz4. progress in sequencing the leishmania genome
will aid this effort greatly in the future (52).
a candidate gene approach led to the identification of sqs1
on cosmid citz4, and deletional studies confirmed that sqs1
mediated itz resistance.  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  is an attractive
target for chemotherapy (36), with many potential inhibitors
under investigation. the availability of the leishmania sqs1
will permit validation of this enzyme target by a gene knockout
approach (53) and the generation of quantities of active enzyme
sufficient for detailed biochemical and structural studies.
our pcr-based screen for other ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes was largely unsuccessful, with both genomic and cosmid
dna as templates. barring technical complications, the simplest explanation is that sequence divergence was responsible,
as trypanosomatid protozoans are quite divergent from fungi
and mammals (54). possibly, these genes do not occur in our set

leishmania have thus yielded an unexpected variety of novel
loci and phenomena.
strengths and limitations of overexpression/selection approach in leishmania—our data show that selection from multicopy cosmid transfectant libraries is an effective way to identify drug resistance loci, with many advantages over de novo
mutant-based approaches such as gene amplification. it is
faster, as long periods of stepwise selection are not required.
candidate resistance loci are recovered immediately in a genetically manipulable form, permitting identification of the
active locus by deletional analysis and sequencing (fig. 3). it
minimizes the recovery of lines exhibiting resistance through
“loss of function” mechanisms, as these occur at a much lower
frequency than seen in cosmid selections (table i). drawbacks
of this methodology are that the level of resistance is often low
(albeit comparable to several known gene amplifications), although by using constructs with smaller leishmania dna
inserts, increased levels of drug resistance can be obtained
(fig. 3). the limitation here will be the ability to completely
cover the genome, given current transfection efficiencies. nonetheless, despite the relatively modest level of drug resistance
conferred, those cosmids recovered from overexpression/selection experiments that were studied in detail yielded bona fide
drug resistance loci. these include ptr1 and dhfr-ts in the
case of two antifolates, tor in the case of toxic nucleosides,
and sqs1 in the case of the sterol synthesis inhibitor itz.
for the antifolates, a large number of colonies bearing multiple cosmids with overlapping genomic dna inserts encoding
ptr1 or dhfr-ts were obtained, in numbers consistent with
prior functional rescue studies using leishmania cosmid libraries (16, 57). thus, the efficiency of recovery of resistance loci by
the overexpression/selection approach was good. for tub only
two overlapping cosmids encoding tor were identified, and for
itz and tbf all loci were identified by a single cosmid (table
iii). this suggests that these genetic selections have not yet
saturated and that additional resistance genes may be found in
future selections.
we recently have extended these studies to a number of
other drugs, and in every case we have recovered one or more
cosmids capable of mediating resistance. as the active genes
within these and other cosmids are identified, hypotheses
about their biochemical mode of action can be formulated. we
expect these studies to lead to a better understanding of mechanisms of drug action and resistance and ultimately to improved anti-leishmania chemotherapy.

of cosmids, perhaps because the selection is not yet saturated
or because they are not capable of conferring itz and tbf
resistance when carried on our cosmid vector. some cosmids
may contain loci unrelated to the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, perhaps acting through inactivation or transport mechanisms. in this regard, we can exclude the leishmania multidrug resistance gene  xxxg10xxx , as our pcr primers successfully
yielded a product with genomic but not cosmid dna templates.
finally, resistance may occur by unexpected mechanisms in
leishmania. together, these factors emphasize the value of the
forward genetic approach taken here.
the recovery of sqs1 in an itz resistance screen was unanticipated, since itz is an inhibitor of the p450-dependent
lanosterol c14-demethylase of both yeast and leishmania,
which is several steps “downstream” of sqs1 in the ergosterol
biosynthetic pathway (fig. 1). in fungi, resistance to azole
inhibitors has been associated with decreased accumulation
(possibly through the action of multidrug efflux transporters),
elevated c14-demethylase activity through gene amplification,
and significantly, increased  xxxg2197xxx  activity (34).
thus, an overall elevation of upstream sterol intermediates
may serve to overcome inhibition of the demethylase. this
would greatly expand the pool of prospective genes recoverable
with overexpression/selection methods with these drugs and
may account for the cross-resistance patterns seen with the
cosmids ctbf1, ctbf3, ctbf6, ctbf7, and citz2.
 xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  is also “upstream” of the presumptive
target of tbf,  xxxg2197xxx  (fig. 1). however, sqs1
overexpression did not lead to tbf resistance (table v), even
with the most active citz4-h4 deletion (fig. 3). conceivably,
tbf and itz may act on other targets in leishmania, although
current data do not support this view (29, 32, 48). the differences in response to elevated substrate levels (presumably
arising from  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  overexpression) suggest that
the mode of inhibition may differ for itz and lanosterol c14demethylase, and tbf and  xxxg2197xxx . both tbf and
itz inhibit their respective fungal target enzymes in a noncompetitive manner (55, 56), but the properties of the leishmania enzymes may differ. differences between fungal and
leishmania sterol metabolism are also evident in the complexity of the resistance patterns exhibited by the citz and ctbf
cosmids. chief among these is collateral hypersensitivity,
which has not been reported previously in allylamine-resistant
organisms. our studies with sterol synthesis inhibitors in
