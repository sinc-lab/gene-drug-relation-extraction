abstract
stimulated human t cells from healthy volunteers demonstrate attenuated early interleukin (il)-2 receptor (r) signaling in the presence of
 xxxd1798xxx  (dac). aiming to confirm that this ex-vivo effect of dac is also observed in-vivo, we studied t cells from 3 kidney transplant
recipients before and 2–3 weeks and 4–6 months after transplantation. we found by flow cytometry that t cells obtained pre-transplant and
stimulated ex-vivo with phytohemeagglutinine upregulated the  xxxg1175xxx  a-(cd25) and h-( xxxg1175xxx ) chains as expected. moreover, exogenous
il-2 induced characteristic tyrosine phosphorylation events detectable by immunoblotting in these cells. however, t cells studied posttransplant neither exhibited cd25 or -122 upregulation nor il-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events, indicating broad, persistent
suppression of the  xxxg1175xxx  signaling machinery which thus appears largely inaccessible for dac in actual transplant recipients. we therefore
conclude that the clinical efficacy of this agent may depend on additional mechanisms in-vivo other than those identified ex-vivo.

 xxxd1798xxx  (dac), a humanized antibody against cd25,
the interleuin-2 receptor ( xxxg1175xxx ) a-chain, is an established
induction agent in human kidney transplantation [1,2]. its
exact mechanism of action in transplant recipients, however,
remains incompletely understood [1,3,4]. simple blockade
of cd25, which is profoundly upregulated during t cell
activation [5], would render this receptor chain unable to
facilitate high-affinity binding of il-2 to the  xxxg1175xxx  and thus
blunt subsequent  xxxg1175xxx -downstream signaling. accordingly, others and we have demonstrated such attenuation
in t cells isolated from healthy human volunteers [4,6], but
in actual transplant recipients, additional potential mechanisms of dac action have been proposed [1,3].

we therefore studied to what extent  xxxg1175xxx  signaling is
directly affected by dac therapy in human kidney transplant
recipients in a manner comparable to that demonstrated in
healthy human volunteers. the study was approved by the
medical institutional review board of the university of
kentucky, and informed assent and consent were obtained at
patient enrollment.
between may of 2001 and november of 2002, three
adolescent kidney transplant recipients (table 1) received a
standard five-dose induction course of dac [1] with routine
triple immunosuppression (tacrolimus, azathioprine or
 xxxd2677xxx , steroids, all in standard adult doses
and with tacrolimus target levels of 10–15 ng/ml in the first
3 months post-transplant and 5–10 thereafter). t lymphocytes were isolated as previously described [6] from the
patients’ peripheral blood by  xxxd3253xxx  gradient-density centrifugation and sheep erythrocyte rosetting immediately
prior to transplantation, 2–3 weeks post-transplant (during
dac therapy), and 4–6 months post-transplant (off dac). no

expression of cd25 by t cells at that time was negligible, and
pha stimulation up-regulated this expression, comparable to
findings in t cells from healthy individuals [6,12]. the
expression of  xxxg1175xxx  was also similar in uremic and healthy
subjects, both before and after pha exposure (fig. 1b), and
the cells responded to exogenous il-2 with robust tyrosine
phosphorylation events (fig. 1c), again comparable to cells
from healthy volunteers [6].
we next sought to determine if dac interferes with early
il-2 signaling in t cells from transplant recipients in ways
comparable to those previously documented in healthy
volunteers [4,6]. patients’ t cells were thus again studied 2–
3 weeks post-transplant, i.e. during dac induction. no exvivo pha stimulation was used for this set of experiments
because the patients were now exposed to alloantigen from
the graft. as shown in fig. 2a, we found that their t cells at
this time point only expressed minimal amounts of cd25
and 122. presumably because of this scarcity of the chains

clinical evidence of allograft rejection was observed in any
of the recipients during the study, and no transplant biopsies
had to be performed.
in t cells obtained pre-transplant, cd25 expression was
induced with low-dose phytohemagglutinine (pha, sigma,
st. louis, mo) for 72 h, followed by brief exposure to an
acid ph, resuspension in fresh medium and rest for 24 h,
rendering activated cells suitable for the study of il-2
signaling [7–9]. anti- xxxd1075xxx  immunoblotting and
flow cytometry were performed as described previously, the
latter using an antibody against cd25 that does not compete
with dac for its epitope [6].
because patients with end-stage renal disease may have t
cell dysfunction [10–14], we examined, immediately before
transplantation, the expression of cd25 and 122 by t cells
from our patients before and after pha activation and the
tyrosine phosphorylation events triggered in the activated
cells by exogenous il-2. as shown in fig. 1a, the constitutive

fig. 2. peripheral t cells from patients studied 2–3 weeks (during dac therapy, a) and 4–6 months (off dac, b) after transplantation show marked and persistent
down-regulation of cd25 and 122 as well as absence of il-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events. experiments shown represent findings in all studied
patients. because of the presence of alloantigen post-transplant, the cells were not stimulated with pha but otherwise treated exactly as outlined in the legend
for fig. 1 above. in scatterplots, no more than 3% of lymphocyte-gated cells exhibited cd25 and 122 expression clearly distinguishable from isotype controls
at either time point (not shown).

and thus of the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx  on the cell surface,
exogenous il-2 furthermore did not induce any clearly
discernible tyrosine phosphorylation events. these findings
indicate that early after transplantation, circulating t cells
from non-rejecting recipients treated with routine triple
rejection prophylaxis and dac induction express few if any
cd25 or 122 on their surface and, consequently, don’t
respond to il-2.
we also studied early il-2 signaling in the transplant
recipients 4 to 6 months post-transplant. at this time point,
dac is largely undetectable in the serum of patients because
its mean half-life in this setting is 20 days [1]. despite this
virtual absence of dac, we found persistently scarce
expression of cd25 and 122 on our patients’ t cells, and
exogenous il-2 again did not induce any clearly discernible
tyrosine phosphorylation events (fig. 2b). these findings
indicate that 4–6 months after transplantation, t cells from
clinically stable recipients treated with routine triple
rejection prophylaxis and dac induction continue to express
only minimal amounts of cd25 and 122 on their surface,
leading to prolonged il-2 unresponsiveness even in the
virtual absence of dac.
taken together, our data indicate that cd25, the target
for antibodies like dac, is only sparsely present on
circulating t cells from stable kidney allograft recipients
up to 6 months post-transplant, raising the intriguing
possibility that these antibodies help prevent allograft
rejection through additional mechanisms other than simply
blockade of cd25 on t cells. especially since we have
previously shown that the antibody we used for flow
cytometry can bind cd25 in the presence of dac [6], the

persistently low surface expression of cd25- and cd122observed on our patients’ t cells after transplantation, even
after therapeutic concentrations of dac are no longer
present, appears to be a dac-induced phenomenon that is
sustained by the robust maintenance immunosuppressants
given to our patients. this concept is supported by
observations from vincenti et al. [15] who showed a
reduction of cd25 expression by lymphocytes from transplant recipients given anti-cd25 therapy in addition to
routine triple immunosuppression, but no such reduction in
control patients on triple therapy alone, as well as by the
demonstrated more bnon-specificq attenuation of  xxxg1175xxx 
expression by steroids and calcineurin inhibitors [16]. also
in keeping with this notion is the concomitantly suppressed
expression of  xxxg1175xxx  we observed because this chain’s upregulation above the level of its constitutive expression
requires t cell activation [14]. along these lines, it could be
argued that it would have been informative to examine how
vigorously t cells obtained 2–3 weeks and 4–6 months after
transplantation upregulate cd25 and 122 during pha
exposure. however, such experiments were not only not
part of the approved study protocol, but they moreover
would have again created an ex-vivo scenario not reflective
of and thus not relevant for the in-vivo situation in actual
transplant recipients. similarly, the possibility that dac
bound to t cells, as opposed to bfreeq dac with its
previously determined half-life, could have been present
and active in our patients beyond 4–6 months posttransplant could be considered. however, our results clearly
show that it is cd25 itself that is markedly attenuated,
regardless of whether any dac is bound to it or not,

46

especially as dac does not compete with the antibody we
used to detect cd25 in our flow cytometric experiments [6].
significant expression of cd25 on peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and its subsequent cleavage and shedding
into the serum is indeed seen in states of immune activation
such as acute allograft rejection, whereas little cd25 is
otherwise found on circulating t cells [17]. accordingly,
and largely in agreement with our results, only small
amounts of cd25 were found on t cells from transplant
recipients treated with anti-cd25 antibodies by amlot et al.
[18] and baan et al. [3]. while the former group did not
follow  xxxg1175xxx , the latter also demonstrated its reduced
expression at least during anti-cd25 therapy. somewhat
contrasting, vincenti et al. [1] detected a comparably large
percentage of cd25+ circulating lymphocytes in patients at
the time of transplantation, followed by a significant
decrease in this percentage during dac therapy, although
at least 15% of circulating lymphocytes demonstrated
continued cd25 expression. these cd25+ cells were not
further characterized, and they could therefore be activated
b lymphocytes which also express cd25 [5] and whose
decreased overall numbers have been observed during dac
therapy [19].
none of the above studies included determinations of
cd25 expression early and often enough to assess whether
there may be a short period of time immediately after
transplantation during which an increased number of cd25+
lymphocytes appear in the circulation as part of an initial
immune response to the new allograft. these cells could
then be immediately coated by anti-cd25 antibody infused
at the time of transplantation and thus rendered unable to
respond with clonal proliferation to il-2 also generated as
part of this initial alloimmune encounter [20]. similarly,
neither we nor others have data on the expression of cd25
or 122 by t cells from kidney transplant recipients who are
acutely rejecting despite receiving dac, somewhat in keeping with the fact that this agent is only approved for the
prevention of acute rejection and not for its treatment once
established. lastly, only a limited amount of information on
t cell function in patients receiving dac is available [3].
additional data along these lines would be especially useful
as cd25+ t cells are increasingly recognized as having
regulatory properties felt to be of potential long-term benefit
post-transplant, an aspect previously discussed by us [6].
the virtual absence of the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , and
specifically cd25 as the target of dac and similar agents, on
circulating t cells from non-rejecting transplant recipients at
the time points studied not only explains why these t cells
are largely unable to respond to il-2, but it also
distinguishes the clinical situation in actual transplant
recipients examined here from that created ex-vivo by
pha activation of peripheral t cells from healthy, nonimmunosuppressed volunteers and studied previously [4,6].
the dac effects seen in these ex-vivo experiments
furthermore suggest that this agent does not require the
environment of the allograft or of lymphatic organs to affect

t cells. consequently, dac’s efficacy in the clinical setting
of organ transplantation may at least partially depend on
additional mechanisms of action distinct from blocking
cd25 on peripheral, circulating t cells.
since the present study was only designed and
approved to reproduce in actual transplant recipients what
had previously been observed studying t cells from
healthy, non-immunosuppressed blood donors [4,6], we
did not search for such additional mechanisms or perform
functional studies of the patients’ t cells. however, limited
evidence from several groups suggests that there are other
means by which dac and similar antibodies may exert
their beneficial effects, e.g. cd25 modulation and internalization [1,4], interference with il-15 signaling [3] and
inhibition of late interferon-g and  xxxg390xxx  expression
[21]. lastly, the possibility that, as outlined above, anticd25 antibodies present in transplant recipients during
induction therapy may indeed quickly bquenchq any
upregulation of cd25 early on during the alloimmune
response and thus help prevent the development of acute
rejection needs to be considered. future studies are
therefore needed to better clarify how dac and similar
agents truly work in the clinical setting of human organ
transplantation and especially how much of their efficacy
is attributable to simple blockade of cd25 as opposed to
other mechanisms of action.
