abstract:  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) is the hypothalamic decapeptide which plays a key role
in the control of reproductive functions. by binding to specific receptors present on the pituitary
gonadotropes, gnrh regulates gonadotropin release and, consequently, steroid hormone secretion from the
gonads. when given continuously and at high doses, gnrh agonists suppress the pituitary gonadal axis
through the down-regulation and desensitization of its own receptors. based on this rationale, pituitary gnrh
receptors represent the target for the successful utilization of gnrh agonists (that are more stable than the
native peptide) for the treatment of hormone-dependent tumors (e.g., prostate, breast, endometrial, ovarian
cancers). the observation that gnrh receptors are expressed in steroid-dependent tumors, and that their
activation reduces cell proliferation and metastatic behavior of cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo
(when inoculated into nude mice), indicates a possible additional and more direct antitumor activity for these
compounds. interestingly, gnrh receptors have been shown to be expressed also in androgen-independent
prostate carcinoma, as well as in tumors that are not classically considered hormone-related (e.g., melanoma),
suggesting a clinical utility of the administration of gnrh analogs also in these tumors. more recently, gnrh
agonists have been proposed as useful carriers to target cytotoxic drugs or toxins to cancer cells displaying
the specific gnrh receptors.
a second form of gnrh (designated gnrh-ii) has been discovered in most vertebrates, including humans.
gnrh-ii has been suggested to act through a ‘putative’ cognate type ii  xxxg931xxx , which is distributed in
different tissues, both normal and tumoral. in humans, a full-length functional type ii  xxxg931xxx  has not
been found. therefore, its functions as well as its possible utility as a molecular target for a gnrh-ii based
therapy in oncology still has to be clarified.
this review will focus on the role of gnrh receptors in the control of tumor growth, progression and
dissemination. it will also be discussed whether the presence of these receptors might represent an additional
rationale for the clinical utility of gnrh analogs as anticancer drugs.

introduction
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) is the
hypothalamic decapeptide that acts as the key regulator of
reproductive functions. by binding to specific receptors on
pituitary gonadotropes, gnrh stimulates gonadotropin
(luteinizing hormone, lh; follicle stimulating hormone,
fsh) release and, subsequently, steroid hormone secretion
from the gonads. a second form of gnrh (gnrh-ii) has
been discovered in most vertebrates, including humans. this
peptide has been proposed to operate via the activation of a
specific receptor (type ii  xxxg931xxx ), which has been
identified in some mammals, but not in humans.
hypothalamic gnrh and its pituitary receptors are now
indicated by some authors as  xxxd2226xxx  and type i gnrh
receptors, respectively.
pituitary gnrh receptors represent the molecular target
of the currently utilized pharmacological treatment of

hormone-dependent tumors, based on gnrh analogs. given
continuously and at high doses, gnrh agonists cause a
desensitization of gonadotropes, thus suppressing the
functions of the pituitary-gonadal axis. it is now well
accepted that gnrh receptors are present also in some
tumors (mainly hormone-related tumors) where they
participate in the local regulation of the malignant behavior
of cancer cells.
this review will be focused on the currently available
data on the expression, the pharmacological profile as well
as the biological functions of tumor gnrh receptors. the
possibility that these receptors might offer a new and
additional rationale for the clinical utilization of gnrh
analogs as anticancer drugs will also be discussed.
hypophysiotropic gnrh
the hypothalamic decapeptide gnrh is the prime
regulator of the pituitary-gonadal axis [1,2]. it is synthesized
in a limited number of neurones in the septal-preoptichypothalamic region. these neurones secrete the decapeptide
into the portal system of the median eminence, through

which it reaches the anterior pituitary gland to stimulate the
synthesis and the secretion of both gonadotropins, which
regulate gonadal sex steroid production. in humans, the
peptide is encoded by a gene which is located on
chromosome 8 and is organized into four exons and three
introns [3,4]. the gene encodes a pre-pro-hormone
consisting of a signal peptide, followed by the sequence of
the decapeptide, by a cleavage site and by the gnrhassociated peptide (gap) [5]. after the processing of the prepro-hormone in the neurosecretory cells, gnrh is released in
a pulsatile way, and this pulsatility is critical for the
maintenance of gonadotropin gene expression and for the
physiological pattern of secretion of both lh and fsh [6].
the synthesis and the secretion of gnrh are the result of
a complex interaction between neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (e.g., cathecholamines, opioids, gaba, npy,
growth factors) and feed-back mechanisms (long, short, and
ultrashort) mediated both by peptidergic and steroid signals
[7-12].
pituitary gnrh receptors
hypothalamic gnrh stimulates pituitary gonadotropin
synthesis and secretion through the activation of specific

marelli et al.

receptors [13]. the gene for the pituitary  xxxg931xxx  is
located on chromosome 4; it is organized into three exons
and two introns and codes for a 328 aminoacid protein
[14,15]. gnrh receptors belong to the family of rhodopsinelike g protein coupled receptors containing seven
transmembrane (7tm) domains [13,16,17]. in humans, they
exhibit some unique features, such as the lack of a cterminal cytoplasmatic tail, that has been shown to be
important for receptor internalization and desensitization
[13,18]. upon hormone binding, the  xxxg931xxx 
activates phospholipase c (plc), via a galphaq/11 protein,
leading to inositol triphosphate (ip3 ), intracellular ca+ +
mobilization and diacylglycerol (dag) formation, and
protein kinase c (pkc) activation. ca + + levels in
gonadotropes increase as a result of an initial mobilization
from intracellular stores followed by an influx of
extracellular ca + + . phospholipase d (pld) and
phopholipase a2 (pla2 ) are also sequentially activated,
probably via pkc [19,20]. finally, other signaling
molecules proposed to mediate the activity of gnrh at
pituitary level include protein kinases operating within the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades, such as
erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), jnk (c-jun nterminal kinase), p38 mapk, and bmk (big mapk)
[19,20] “fig. (1a)”.

gnrh agonists and antagonists

gnrh antagonists

the elucidation of the crucial functions played by
pituitary gnrh receptors in the control of the pituitarygonadal axis pointed out their crucial role as molecular
targets for the treatment of several reproduction-related
diseases. based on this observation and given the short halflife of gnrh in the circulation, efforts have been made to
develop synthetic gnrh analogs that might bind pituitary
gnrh receptors, either mimicking (agonists) or
counteracting (antagonists) the activity of the native
decapeptide.

gnrh antagonists competitively block gnrh receptors
and their activation by the native peptide [3,22,25,27,28].
the search for gnrh antagonists has been stimulated by the
desire to produce compounds able to suppress gonadotrope
function without inducing the ‘flare-up’ phenomenon. first
generation gnrh antagonist decapeptides, such as nal-glugnrh, presented a very complex structure, with multiple
amino acid substitutions at positions 1,2,3,6,8 and 10 [27].
these compounds had a limited duration of action and
undesiderable side effects, such as edematogenic properties
and anaphylactoid reactions [27]. new generation gnrh
antagonists still present multiple structural modifications,
but they preserve high activity with diminished
anaphylactoid effects [27]; however, they exhibit solubility
limitations. some of them are already clinically available
( xxxd466xxx ,  xxxd2180xxx ), while others are under development
( xxxd51xxx , antide, acyline, azaline b,  xxxd1826xxx , teverelix)
[27,28] (table 1). more recently, non-peptide gnrh
antagonists have been made available [28]. so far, several
small molecules belonging to different chemical classes have
appeared in the literature: pyridine and pyrimidine
derivatives, quinolones, tryptamine analogs, macrolides
derived from erythromycin a, oligonucleotide-based
substances (29-35). all these drugs bind with high affinity
the pituitary gnrh receptors and they also display
biological activity by blocking the pituitary-gonadal axis in
experimental animals (36-38). non-peptide gnrh
antagonists can be administered orally [39] and, therefore,
they have the advantage of flexible dosing and titration of
drug concentration. some of them are reported to be
currently in clinical trials [28,40].

gnrh agonists
the development of synthetic gnrh agonists has been
conducted on the basis of the following considerations: 1)
the degradation of gnrh occurs mainly at the gly residue in
position 6 [21]; 2) both the nh2- and cooh-termini of the
peptide are essential for the binding to the receptor; 3) the
nh 2-terminal domain also plays a crucial role in receptor
activation [22]. to date, the most widely utilized gnrh
agonists are characterized by the presence of a d-amino acid
in position 6, by the substitution of the carboxyl terminal
gly10-amide with an ethylamide residue. clinical examples
are:  xxxd3445xxx , [d-trp6]gnrh; leuprolide, [d-leu6,pro6nhet)gnrh;  xxxd387xxx , [ xxxd5xxx ( xxxd3319xxx )6,pro9-nhet]gnrh;
 xxxd2229xxx , [ xxxd5xxx ( xxxd3319xxx )6,aza-gly10]gnrh; and  xxxd2691xxx ,
[d-nal(2) 6 ]gnrh. these synthetic compounds are more
potent than gnrh itself [23-25] (table 1). at the pituitary
level, gnrh agonists may behave like the native hormone
and stimulate gonadotropin secretion; they must be
administered in a pulsatile way in order to mimick gnrh
secretion and maintain pituitary function. on the other hand,
when gnrh superactive agonists are administered
continuously and at high doses, they induce, after a short
initial stimulation (‘flare-up’ phenomenon) gonadotrope
desensitization, thus suppressing gonadal activity (‘chemical
castration’) [2,24,26].

subjects; 2) to suppress the pituitary-gonadal axis, in all
those clinical situations in which gonadotropin (e.g., in
ivt/art) and steroid activity require blocking. in patients
with a problem of gnrh deficiency or with disordered
secretion of endogenous gnrh (primary or secondary
amenorrea, radiation damage to the central nervous system,
panhypopituitarism, etc.) pulsatile administration of gnrh
or gnrh agonists can restore the episodic secretion of
gonadotropins and, consequently, the production of sex
steroids from the gonads [2,41-43]. as described above,
chronic administration of gnrh agonists leads, after a first
initial phase of stimulation (‘flare-up’), to a condition of
‘chemical castration’ due to pituitary  xxxg931xxx 
desensitization and complete suppression of the functions of
the pituitary-gonadal axis “fig. (1 b)”. based on this
mechanism of action, superactive gnrh agonists are widely
and successfully used for the treatment of different hormonerelated pathologies, including tumors of the reproductive
tract. for example, gnrh agonists are utilized in order to
suppress pathological function of the pituitary-gonadal axis
(e.g., precocious puberty, polycystic ovarian disease). these
compounds are also employed for the suppression of a
normal pituitary-gonadal function, when circulating
gonadotropins either interfere with a specific medical goal
(e.g., in vitro fertilization) [44-46], or exhacerbate a
pathological condition (either benign or malignant) of the
reproductive tract [2,47-51]. gnrh agonists are
predominantly administered through monthly subcutaneous
or intramuscular injections of slow release polyglycyl lactide
polymers or daily nasal spray administration.
based on their ability to block the pituitary-gonadal axis,
gnrh agonists are widely and successfully used in
reproductive oncology “fig. (1b)”.
prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous
malignant tumor in men. it is initially androgen-dependent
and the pharmacological treatment is aimed at suppressing
androgen secretion and/or action. therapy with gnrh
agonists is at present the preferred treatment, leading in
about 14-28 days to a complete suppression of serum
testosterone levels. antiandrogens may be administered prior
to or during early therapy with gnrh agonists in order to
prevent the effects of ‘flare-up’ phenomenon [47,49,52-54]
but also to achieve complete androgen blockade by
antagonizing the adrenal androgen contribution.
in women, breast cancer is of high incidence accounting
for one-third of female cancers, and is frequently estrogendependent. the primary management of early breast cancer is
represented by the surgical removal of the tumor by
mastectomy, with or without radiotherapy. from the
pharmacological point of view, selective  xxxg730xxx 
modulators (serms) such as tamoxifen [52,55-57], or
aromatase inhibitors such as  xxxd173xxx  [58-61] are used to
counteract the growth of  xxxg730xxx  positive tumors,
as well as to reduce the risk of recurrence. clinical studies
have demonstrated that gnrh agonists may also be useful
for the treatment of estrogen-dependent estrogen-receptor
positive breast cancers. these compounds have been used
either alone or in association with tamoxifen: the combined
treatment being more effective than the treatment with either
drug alone [62]. surprisingly, regression of tumor mass
accompanied by disappearance of metastases has been

marelli et al.

reported with gnrh agonists treatment not only in
premenopausal, but also in some postmenopausal women
[63].
the use of gnrh agonists in the therapy of endometrial
cancer is based on the assumption that, by blocking the
pituitary  xxxg931xxx , they suppress the secretion of
estrogens, the most important stimulus for this tumor.
some cases of complete remission of the pathology have
been reported [49,64,65]. however, additional clinical trials
should be performed before considering gnrh agonists as a
standard therapy for this pathology.
ovarian cancer, which usually occurs in postmenopausal
women, responds poorly to chemotherapy. since it has been
reported to be sensitive to lh and fsh, gnrh agonists
have been proposed as a possible alternative treatment, based
on their ability to suppress pituitary-gonadal functions.
however, the data so far available seem to indicate that the
number of positive responses to this treatment is relatively
low [66].
in spite of the wide application of gnrh agonists for the
treatment of hormone-related tumors (mainly prostate
cancer), the problem of the ‘flare-up’ phenomenon still
remains an undesiderable side effect. therefore, the necessity
to obtain an immediate and complete suppression of the
function of the pituitary gnrh receptors, has stimulated
structure-activity studies for the development of decapeptide
gnrh analogs with antagonistic activity. these compounds
were designed to compete with the native decapeptide for the
binding to the receptors, thus immediately blocking lh and
fsh secretion “fig. (1b)” [22,24,28,67-69]. as pointed out
before, the first gnrh antagonists to be synthesized were
not suitable for clinical use because of solubility limitations
and edematogenic side effects caused by histamine release
[27,28]. later-generations antagonists have been shown to
possess low histamine-releasing potency and to be safe and
well tolerated. clinical trials so far performed with gnrh
antagonists (such as  xxxd51xxx ) seem to indicate that they
might represent an effective alternative treatment for cancer
patients (particularly prostate cancer); however, it is still
unclear whether these compounds will have an impact on
disease outcome and survival better than that of gnrh
agonists [70]. most gnrh decapeptide antagonists are
commercially available as 1-month depot preparations.
recently, non-peptide gnrh antagonists have been
developed; they have the advantage that they can be
administered orally [28,39] thus allowing dose variation and
rapid withdrawal. future studies will clarify whether they are
as clinically effective as peptide analogs.
gnrh receptors in tumors
soon after the discovery that gnrh receptors were
expressed in extrapituitary reproductive tissues it became
clear that these receptors were present also in tumors derived
from these tissues (e.g., prostate, breast, endometrium,
ovary). extensive reaserch has been performed to clarify
whether tumor gnrh receptors might play some role in the
regulation of cancer cell proliferation. these studies led to
the hypothesis that tumor gnrh receptors might represent
an additional and more direct target for the clinical

 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) receptors in tumors

utilization of gnrh analogs for the treatment of endocrinerelated neoplasias.
expression of gnrh receptors
gnrh receptors in tumors have been first characterized
by means of radioreceptor assays and immunoblotting (71).
however, these studies led to divergent observations. in the
authors’ laboratory only one class of low affinity and high
capacity binding sites could be detected in prostate cancer
cells, either androgen-dependent (lncap) or androgenindependent (du 145) [72,73]. similar results have also
been reported by others in endometrial and ovarian cancer
cells and tissues [74,75]. other studies emphasized the
presence of two types of receptors, one with high affinity
and low capacity and the other one with low affinity and
high capacity in breast and other gynaecological cancers [7679]. finally, one single class of high affinity gnrh binding
sites has been reported in breast, ovarian and endometrial
cancers by other authors [80-84]. these discrepancies in the
binding characteristics have prompted the study of gnrh
receptors at the molecular level. we have reported the
presence of the mrna coding for the receptor in prostate
cancer cell lines [73,85]. moreover, by western blot analysis
and by using a specific monoclonal antibody raised against
the human pituitary receptor, we have also been able to
detect a protein whose molecular weight (64 kda)
corresponds to that of pituitary receptor [86,87]. in
agreement with these observations, studies performed in
prostate cancer tissues taken from patients at biopsy indicate
that the mrna coding for gnrh receptors is expressed in
primary, potentially androgen-dependent, as well as in
hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas [88]; however,
whether the levels of expression of the receptors vary
according to the phase of progression of the pathology is
still a matter of debate.
similar observations have been reported for tumors of the
female reproductive tract. gnrh receptors are expressed both
at mrna and at protein level in breast cancer cell lines as
well as in about 50% of breast cancer specimens [71,80,8992], in most endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines and in
over 80% of biopsy specimens of these cancers [79,83,9396]. in all these tumors, also the peptide gnrh has been
shown to be present [72,73,75,83,97-101] supporting the
existence of an autocrine/paracrine gnrh/ xxxg931xxx 
system, and thus suggesting that this system might
participate in the local regulation of tumor growth.
unexpectedly, both gnrh and gnrh receptors have been
recently shown to be expressed in melanoma cells,
indicating that the gnrh-based system may also be present
and active in tumors that are not classically related to the
reproductive system [102].

dose-dependently decreases the proliferation of prostate
cancer cells, either androgen-dependent [72,85] or androgenindependent [73,103]. the growth of androgen-independent
prostate cancer cells is also significantly reduced in vivo,
when the cells are xenografted into nude mice [104].
an antimitogenic activity of gnrh agonists has been
widely reported also for cancer cells of the female
reproductive tract, both in vitro and in vivo [77,95,105-109].
taken together, these observations indicate that in cancers of
the reproductive tract, the locally expressed gnrh system
might act as an autocrine negative regulator of tumor
growth. further experiments have been recently performed in
the authors’ laboratory to investigate whether gnrh
receptors might also be involved in the regulation of the
metastatic behavior of cancer cells. preliminary data so far
obtained indicate that gnrh agonists significantly reduce
the migratory as well as the invasive properties of highly
aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (du
145 and  xxxg1682xxx ) [montagnani marelli and coworkers,
unpublished observations].
therefore, activation of locally expressed receptors seems
to counteract not only the growth but also the progression to
the metastatic phase of cancer cells. surprisingly, in tumors
of the reproductive tract, both male and female, it has been
shown that some gnrh antagonists, such as  xxxd466xxx ,
consistently exert an antiproliferative activity similar to that
of gnrh agonists [110-114]. the reason why synthetic
peptides like  xxxd466xxx  behave as gnrh antagonists on
pituitary gonadotropes and as agonists on tumor cells is still
unclear. however, this pharmacology has been demonstrated
for antiproliferative effects through a galphai/ xxxg1372xxx  (stressactivated protein kinase) pathway in hek 293 cells stably
transfected with the type i  xxxg931xxx  [115]. one
explanation might propose that some differences exist, at the
molecular level, between the  xxxg931xxx  of pituitary
cells and the receptor present in tumors of the reproductive
system. alternatively, in these tumors, molecules such as
 xxxd466xxx  might act through the activation of a different
 xxxg931xxx  (type ii receptor?) (see below).
in the authors’ laboratory it has been shown that gnrh
agonists exert an antiproliferative effect also in melanoma
cells [102]. moreover, these compounds reduce the
migratory and the invasive capacity of these cells [102], by
decreasing the expression and/or activity of cell adhesion
molecules (integrins) and of proteolytic enzymes (matrix
metalloproteinases) that are involved in the metastatic
progression of melanoma. interestingly, the gnrh
anatagonist  xxxd466xxx  does not affect melanoma cell
proliferation [moretti and coworkers, unpublished
observations], further suggesting that the molecular
properties of the  xxxg931xxx  might differ according to
the cancer tissue in which it is present.

regulation of tumor growth and progression
the demonstration of the presence of gnrh and gnrh
receptors in tumors prompted intensive investigation aimed
at clarifying whether this system might play some role in
the control of tumor growth and progression. in the authors’
laboratory it has been shown that activation of tumor gnrh
receptors, achieved by means of potent gnrh agonists,

taken together, these results indicate that gnrh
receptors may be expressed in different tumors, either related
or unrelated to the reproductive tract. these data also suggest
that, in tumors in which they are expressed, these receptors
might mediate a direct antiproliferative and antimetastatic
activity of gnrh analogs “fig. (2 b)”.

fig. (2). (a ) gnrh intracellular signalling pathway in hormone-related tumors. (b ) proposed direct antiproliferative and
antimetastatic activity of gnrh agonists, and possibly of some gnrh antagonists, in tumors expressing the  xxxg931xxx .

molecular mechanisms of the antitumor activity of
gnrh agonists
the biological activity mediated by the  xxxg931xxx  is
different according to the tissues in which it is expressed. at
the pituitary level, the receptor mediates the stimulatory
action of gnrh on gonadotropin secretion through the
galphaq/11-plc signal transduction pathway. on the contrary,
it has been shown that, in prostate cancer cells and benign
prostate hyperplasia cells, the  xxxg931xxx  is linked to a
g alpha i protein which, through the inhibition of camp
accumulation, may mediate the antiproliferative and
antimetastatic activity of gnrh analogs [25,87,116]. in line
with these observations, the possible involvement of a galphai
protein in the antitumoral activity of gnrh and of its
synthetic analogs has also been reported for cancers of the
female reproductive tract. in ovarian and endometrial
carcinoma cells, gnrh agonists decrease the pertussis toxininduced adp ribosylation of an immunodetected galphai [117120]. surprisingly, the  xxxg931xxx  expressed in
melanoma cells does not seem to be coupled to a
galphai/camp system [moretti and coworkers, unpublished
observations].

the molecular mechanisms downstream of  xxxg2224xxx  i
activation which lead to an inhibition of cancer cell
proliferation, apoptosis and metastatic behavior are still
poorly understood. in prostate cancer cells, gnrh analogs
seem to exert their antitumor activity by interfering with
some of the cellular mechanisms mediating the stimulatory
action of growth factors, such as egf and  xxxg1144xxx . in these
cells, gnrh agonists have been reported to reduce the
number of both egf and  xxxg1144xxx  receptors and to counteract
the autophosphorylation of growth factor receptors induced
by the cognate growth factor [121-125]. similar results have
been reported for tumors of the female reproductive tract. in
breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines, gnrh
agonists reduce  xxxg2198xxx  activity at the membrane
level as well as the specific tyrosine autophosphorylation of
the egf receptor. these effects appear to be mediated by the
activation of a  xxxg401xxx 
[117,119,126,127]. other studies in human benign prostate
hyperplasia (bph-i) and in choriocarcinoma (jeg-3) cells
show that gnrh analogs stimulate apoptosis through galphai

 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) receptors in tumors

from the present data it might be concluded that, in
tumor cells of the reproductive tract, gnrh and gnrh
agonists exert their anticancer effect by interfering with the
activity of growth factors, mainly through the activation of
galphai protein coupled receptors “fig. (2 a)”.
tumor gnrh receptors: a new molecular
target for the clinical application of
gnrh analogs in oncology?
as previously mentioned, gnrh agonists are widely and
successfully used for the treatment of hormone-dependent
tumors on the basis of their ability to suppress the pituitarygonadal axis, through gonadotrope desensitization. these
compounds are very effective in the majority of cases and
their action is reversible and practically devoid of toxicity.
on the other hand, the widely and consistently reported
inhibitory activity of gnrh agonists on cancer cells in vitro
as well as the presence of gnrh receptors in cancer tissues,
suggested that gnrh receptors present in tumoral tissue
might represent a new molecular target for the clinical
application of these compounds in oncology. the
observation that gnrh agonists inhibit the proliferation of
cancer cells from tumors of the reproductive tract (either
hormone-dependent or hormone-resistant) as well as from
tumors not classically related to the reproductive system
(i.e., melanoma) strongly supported the following
considerations: 1) when utilized for the treatment of
hormone-dependent tumors, gnrh agonists might exert, in
addition to their well established suppression of the
pituitary-gonadal axis, a more direct antiproliferative action
at the level of the tumor; 2) gnrh agonists might be
considered for the treatment of tumors that have escaped
their dependence on circulating steroids; 3) the clinical use
of gnrh analogs might be extended to non-reproductive
tissue tumors that express gnrh receptors. unfortunately, it
is still unclear wheter the direct effect of gnrh analogs on
hormone-responsive cancers contributes to their efficacy
mediated by the suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis, a
fact that is obviously difficult to ascertain in patients.
moreover, the clinical trials performed so far in hormoneindependent tumors are too scanty to allow definitive
conclusions. studies on gnrh agonist treatment have been
performed in postmenopausal women with ovarian cancers,
who relapsed after the failure of a conventional therapy. an
objective remission has been reported in about 10% of the
cases with a disease stabilization, and a longer median
survival in about 25% of patients [128,129]. a number of
objective remissions and disease stabilization after gnrh
agonist treatment has been reported also in women suffering
from relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancers [130-132].
similar observations have been published for gnrh
antagonists [131]. however, so far, no objective clinical
responses to these compounds have been reported in
hormone-independent breast and prostate cancer and in the
hormone-unrelated melanoma. the reason for this lack of
evidence of a direct action of gnrh analogs on tumors
expressing gnrh receptors is still unclear. we have
speculated that the concentrations of gnrh analogs effective
at the level of the tumor in order to provide a direct
anticancer activity in patients might be higher than that
required to suppress the pituitary-gonadal axis [25]. it is also

possible that too few cases have been studied and not
sufficiently thoroughly.
the presence of gnrh receptors in several tumors has
recently opened a new field of research based on the
possibility of utilizing gnrh analogs to carry cytotoxic
agents directly to cancer cells expressing the  xxxg931xxx .
it is well known that standard chemotherapy is accompanied
by serious side effects which are mainly due to the fact that
cytotoxic compounds do not distinguish sufficiently
between tumor and normal cells. to enhance specificity,
chemotherapeutic drugs have been linked to ligands that can
recognize tumor-associated antigens (ligand-targeted
cytotoxic chemotherapy). once bound to the antigen
expressed on cancer cells, the complex is supposed to be
internalized so that the cytotoxic can selectively destroy the
cancer cell. based on this rationale, conjugated compounds
have been obtained by covalently linking gnrh agonists to
cytotoxic radicals. in particular, schally and coworkers have
prepared the an-152 conjugate, in which doxorubicin is
linked to the [d-lys6]gnrh agonist, and an-207, which
consists of 2-pyrrolidino-doxorubicin coupled to the same
gnrh agonist [49,133]. so far, cytotoxic analogs of gnrh
have been shown to reduce the proliferation of prostate,
breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer cells, either in vitro or
in vivo when xenografted into nude mice [133-137]. similar
observations have been obtained with gnrh agonists linked
either to the pokeweed antiviral protein (pap, a plant
derived ribosome inactivating protein causing inhibition of
protein translation and cell death) [138,139], or to hecate (an
amphipathic membrane disrupting peptide) [140]. finally,
rahimipour and coworkers [141] have recently synthesized
conjugated compounds composed of either a gnrh agonist
or a gnrh antagonist linked to a photosensitizer agent
( xxxd3037xxx ). when tested on human breast cancer
cells (mcf-7) transfected with the  xxxg931xxx , the
conjugates decrease cell proliferation, possibly as a
consequence of a selective photodamage of the cells.
although these results in experimental models look
promising, clinical trials are necessary to verify the
effectiveness of gnrh analogs-targeted anticancer treaments.
one of the potential limitations of the efficacy of these
agents is the low number of gnrh receptors on tumor cells
and the poor internalization of the human  xxxg931xxx .
gnrh-ii and type ii gnrh receptors
over the past decade it became increasingly clear that a
second form of gnrh is present in most vertebrates,
including humans. this form, which is called gnrh-ii, was
originally isolated from the chicken brain and its structure is
uniquely conserved from fish to mammals [142-146].
gnrh-ii is a decapeptide which is encoded by a gene
organized in four exons and three introns like the gene
coding for the hypophysiotropic gnrh, but is located on
chromosome 20 in humans [142,143]. gnrh-ii has three
aminoacid differences (his5, trp7, tyr8) from gnrh “fig.
(3)”. the gnrh-ii peptide is widely distributed in the
central nervous system (limbic structures, preoptic area,
mediobasal hypothalamus, midbrain) as well as in the
peripheral nervous system and tissues, such as kidney, bone
marrow, immune cells, prostate, testis and in female

reproductive tract tissues (placenta, endometrium, breast,
ovary) [143,147-154].
the presence of gnrh-ii in several tissues has
stimulated the search for a cognate  xxxg931xxx  (type ii
 xxxg931xxx ) [13,144,145,155]. this was first cloned
from human cdna [155] then from amphibian [156] and
non-human primates (marmoset and rhesus monkey)
[157,158]. the receptor is a classical gpcr with a cterminal cytoplasmic tail containing several threonine and
serine residues which are potential phosphorylation sites that
might be important for rapid desensitization and receptor
internalization. the type ii receptor is coupled to a galphaq/11
protein and to the plc-activated intracellular signalling
pathway [157]. the primate receptor has close sequence
homology with type ii gnrh receptors present in nonmammalian vertebrates and is quite different from the human
type i receptor [13,144,145,155]. pharmacological characterization of the primate type ii  xxxg931xxx  transfected in
cos-i cells revealed a high affinity for gnrh-ii while the
classical gnrh has a much lower binding affinity.
interestingly, it has been reported that some antagonists of
the pituitary type i  xxxg931xxx  behave as agonists at the
type ii  xxxg931xxx  [145]. so far, a full-length functional
type ii  xxxg931xxx  protein has not been demonstrated in
human tissue. the gene sequence reveals a shift in the
reading frame that disrupts the receptor near its n-terminus
and a stop codon in the sequence coding its second
extracellular loop [144,145]. an extensive study of type ii
 xxxg931xxx  transcripts in multiple tissues and cell lines
found no transcripts that could be translated into a
conventional functional gpcr. however, it is possible that
partial transcripts could provide protein products which have
other functions. a kozac consensus sequence start site
follow the stop codon [159] and would translate tm
domains 6 and 7. this receptor fragment has been shown to
modulate the expression of the type i receptor [160].
in the species in which it is expressed, gnrh ii seems to
be involved in neuromodulation, and has been shown to
stimulate reproductive behaviour in the musk shrew [161]
and marmoset [162].
type ii gnrh receptors in tumors
gnrh-ii as well as type ii  xxxg931xxx  transcripts
have been shown to be expressed in human cancers of the

female reproductive tract, as well as in cancer cell lines
derived from these tissues [148,150-152,163,164]. these
observations suggested the existence, in these tumors, of a
gnrh-ii-based system, which might participate in the local
regulation of cell proliferation, possibly by interacting with
the previously demonstrated gnrh system. gnrh-ii has
been consistently reported to inhibit the proliferation of
breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer cells [148,150152,163,164]. the action of gnrh-ii seems to be specific
since it has been shown to also decrease the proliferation in
ovarian cancer cells in which the classical form of the gnrh
receptors has apparently been knocked-out [165]. taken
together, these data might point to the tumor type-ii gnrh
receptor as an additional target for the development of new
anticancer gnrh-ii like peptides. moreover, as previously
discussed, it has been suggested that compounds like
 xxxd466xxx , which are classical gnrh antagonists at the
pituitary level but behave as agonists at tumor level by
decreasing cell proliferation, might actually act on tumor
cells through the binding to, and the activation of, the type
ii  xxxg931xxx . however, other authors have demonstrated
that this type of pharmacology can be displayed in hek293
cells stably transfected with the type i  xxxg931xxx  [115].
as pointed out above, the gene coding for the type ii
 xxxg931xxx  in humans is characterized by the presence of
a frame-shift and of an in-frame stop codon
[144,145,159,160]. on the basis of this observation, and a
failure to demonstrate corrective mechanisms (e.g.,
selenocysteine incorporation for the stop codon), millar’s
group stated that a functional type ii  xxxg931xxx  protein
cannot be present in humans [115]. according to these
[115,160] and other authors [166] it is possible that also in
tumor tissues, the type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene might give
rise to partial transcripts which may give rise, by alternative
translation, to different peptide fragments. the possible
functions of these receptor fragments are at present unknown;
however, they might associate with the classical form of the
 xxxg931xxx  to modulate its activity [160]. these
hypotheses, based on the potent antiproliferative activity of
gnrh-ii on breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer cells,
point to the possible application of gnrh-ii analogs in
oncology. in very preliminary experiments, we have
observed that both gnrh-ii and a type-ii  xxxg931xxx 
transcript (corresponding to the previously reported 5tm
type ii  xxxg931xxx  mrna) are expressed in human

 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) receptors in tumors

prostate cancer cell lines and that gnrh-ii significantly
decreases prostate cancer cell proliferation [limonta and
coworkers, unpublished observations]. the expression of
type-ii  xxxg931xxx  fragments, as well as their possible
role in the control of tumor cell growth, urgently need to be
verified, in view of an important possible application of
gnrh-ii (and its forthcoming synthetic analogs) in
oncology.
conclusions and future directions
gnrh analogs are widely and successfully used for the
treatment of hormone-dependent neoplasias. gnrh agonists,
which represent an alternative to surgical castration, suppress
the pituitary-gonadal axis through  xxxg931xxx 
desensitisation at the pituitary level. gnrh antagonists
compete with native gnrh for the binding to its receptors.
recently, gnrh receptors have been found to be expressed
in a number of tumors of the reproductive tract (both
hormone-dependent and hormone-independent) as well as in
melanoma cells. interestingly, tumor gnrh receptors
correspond to pituitary receptors in terms of mrna
sequence and of protein molecular weight, but they display a
different pharmacological profile. experimental evidence
indicates that gnrh agonists, as well as some antagonists
(such as  xxxd466xxx ) may bind to these receptors leading to a
significant inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and
metastatic behavior.
these observations seem to suggest an additional and
more direct mechanism of action for the oncostatic activity
of gnrh analogs and a possible utilization of these
compounds for the treatment of the more advanced and
chemoresistant tumors of the reproductive tract as well as of
tumors that are not classically related to the reproductive
system, such as melanoma. moreover, gnrh receptors in
tumors might be considered the molecular target to bring
cytotoxic compounds to specifically kill tumor cells.
