abstract
introduction the association between use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) and breast cancer risk remains
unclear. inconsistencies in previously reported findings may be
partly due to differences in expression of cyclooxygenase
(cox)-2. we hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms (cox2 .926, cox-2 .5209, and cox-2 .8473) may reduce overall
breast cancer risk or risk for subtypes of breast cancer by
modulating the inflammatory response and may interact with
aspirin or any nsaid use.
methods we conducted a population-based, case-control
study in which we genotyped 1,067 breast cancer cases and
1,110 control individuals included in the long island breast
cancer study project.
results no major effects of the three cox-2 variant alleles on
breast cancer risk were found. a total of eight distinct

introduction
in recent years, several relatively large studies have examined
the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) and breast cancer. a meta-analysis of 14 studies
(six prospective studies and eight case-control studies) [1]
demonstrated a decrease of 20% in the risk for breast cancer
among nsaid users. harris and coworkers [2] observed an
inverse relationship between incidence of breast cancer and
intake of nsaids in a prospective cohort study, with an

haplotypes and 18 diplotypes were observed in the population.
overall, no significant associations between cox-2
haplotypes/diplotypes and breast cancer risk were observed.
among women who used aspirin or any nsaid there was little
evidence for an interaction with the at-risk cox-2 genotypes,
with one exception. among women with  xxxg1603xxx 
positive breast cancer, the reduced risk for any nsaid use was
only evident among those who had at least one variant c allele
of cox-2 .8473 (odds ratio = 0.7, 95% confidence interval =
0.5 to 1.0; p for the interaction = 0.02). there was no
corresponding interaction for aspirin use, possibly because of
limited power.

conclusion these data provide modest evidence that the c
allele of cox-2 .8473 may interact with nsaids to reduce risk
for  xxxg1603xxx  positive breast cancer.

approximately 40% decreased risk for breast cancer in regular
aspirin users. more recent studies [3,4], including our previous
analyses from the long island breast cancer study project
[5], demonstrated that use of aspirin (the most commonly used
nsaid) is associated with a significant reduction in risk for
breast cancer, especially for  xxxg1603xxx  positive
tumors. however, data from several recent cohort studies
[6,7] have been less consistent.

the anticancer activity of nsaids is believed to be due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox)-2, which is over-expressed in
many types of cancer, including breast cancer, and plays a
major role in tumorigenesis [8,9]. cox-2 encodes one of two
cox enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandins
(pgs) from the dietary fatty acid  xxxd208xxx  [10].
increased cox-2 levels are associated with increased angiogenesis, increased estrogen synthesis, and reduced apoptosis, all of which may stimulate tumor growth [7]. in breast
cancer pgs, particularly pge2, have an organ-site-specific
effect of increasing the levels of aromatase, thereby increasing
estrogen and progesterone synthesis [10-12]. cox-2 expression has been reported in a significant proportion of preinvasive and invasive breast cancers [10,13], and different
frequencies of cox-2 over-expression have been observed in
subgroups of breast cancer patients by  xxxg1603xxx  status ( xxxg730xxx  [er] and  xxxg1737xxx  [pr]).
more frequent elevation in cox-2 expression was noted in
er/pr-negative breast cancer [14]. cox-2 expression also
had a different impact on prognosis in subgroups of tumors.
elevated expression of cox-2 was associated with poor survival in er-positive or pr-positive tumors (p < 0.002) but not
in er/pr-negative ones [14]. therefore, it is biologically plausible that the protective effect of nsaids comes, at least in
part, from limiting either the amount or activity of cox-2
present in the cell, both of which are partly determined by specific polymorphisms [15-18].
the previous inconsistent findings on the association between
nsaids and breast cancer risk might be explained by interindividual differences in cox-2 gene expression or be limited to
certain subtypes of breast cancer. thus, we hypothesized that
potential functional genetic polymorphisms (variant alleles or
haplotypes/diplotypes) in cox-2 that result in altered expression and/or activity of the protein may modulate the inflammatory response, modifying overall breast cancer risk or risk for
subtypes of breast cancer. single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps) in the promoter and 3'-untranslated region (utr) of
cox-2 were previously reported to modulate the risks for
prostate, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, bladder, biliary tract,
and non-small-cell lung cancer [17,19-31]. a few previous
reports showed that the cox-2 .926 g→c polymorphism
examined here can result in higher cox-2 expression and lead
to an approximate 30% reduction in promoter activity in vitro
[15,18]. no functional studies of other cox-2 polymorphisms
potentially associated with cancer risks have been reported.
little is known regarding cox-2 polymorphism and breast
cancer risk and its potential interactions with aspirin and
nsaid use [32-35].

materials and methods
study population
the study population of the long island breast cancer study
project has been described in detail previously [36]. in brief,
cases were adult female residents of nassau and suffolk

page 2 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

counties on long island, new york, who were of any age or
race, spoke english, and were newly diagnosed with in situ or
invasive breast cancer between 1 august 1996 and 31 july
1997. control individuals were frequency matched to the
expected age distribution of the cases and were identified
through random digit dialing for women aged under 65 years
and through the center for medicare and medicaid services
rosters for women aged 65 years and older. eligible control
individuals were women who spoke english and who resided
in the same long island counties as the cases, but who had
no personal history of breast cancer. the study was conducted with approval from participating institutional review
boards, and in accordance with an assurance filed with and
approved by the us department of health and human
services.
interview response rates among eligible cases and controls
were 82.1% (n = 1,508) and 62.8% (n = 1,556), respectively.
of those who completed the 100-minute main questionnaire,
73.1% of cases (1,102) and 73.3% of controls (1,141)
donated a blood sample [36]. as previously reported, an
increase in breast cancer among women on long island was
found to be associated with lower parity, late age at first birth,
little or no breastfeeding, a family history of breast cancer, and
increasing income and education [36]. results were similar
when the analyses were restricted to respondents who
donated blood [36] or to those with dna available for these
analyses (data not shown). factors that were found to be
associated with decreased likelihood that a respondent would
donate blood included increasing age, past smoking status,
ever consuming alcohol, ever breastfeeding, ever using hormone replacement therapy, ever using oral contraceptives,
and ever having had a mammogram. case-control status was
not a predictor of blood donation [36].
selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms
the human cox-2 gene contains 10 exons and spans 8.3
kilobases [37]. we collected data on cox-2 polymorphisms
from publicly available databases, such as dbsnp [38],
ucsc genome bioinformatics [39], and genecards [40]. a
total of 124 snps in cox-2 were identified and the studied
snps chosen according to the following criteria: (a) a minor
allele frequency of 5% or greater in caucasians, according to
literature data; and (b) more than 80% homology between
human and rat/mouse genome, or (c) previous laboratory evidence indicating a significant functional effect, or (d) previous
epidemiologic findings indicating associations with cancer
susceptibility. finally, three snps were selected and genotyped for the present study: cox-2 .926 g→c (promoter
region, rs20417), which satisfies all four criteria; and cox-2
.5209 g→t (intron 5, rs20432) and cox-2 .8473 c→t
(exon 10, 3'-utr, rs5275), both of which satisfy three of the
four criteria (specifically, criteria a, b, and d).

genotyping
genomic dna was extracted [41] by standard rnase/proteinase k and phenol/chloroform treatment and genotyped by a
fluorescence polarization method, using a commercial acycloprime™-fp snp detection kit obtained from perkinelmer life
sciences (boston, ma, usa) [42]. the forward and reverse
primers were designed according to the human cox-2 gene
sequence (genebank accession number d28235.1) and
were (respectively) as follows: 5'-cat tta  xxxg873xxx  tcc ctg
caa at-3' and 5'-tac ctt cac ccc ctc ctt gt-3' for
cox-2 .926; 5'-cat gat tat gcc gct ttc aa-3' and 5'tcc acc aaa gct aca aac tga-3' for cox-2 .5209;
and 5'-ttc caa tgc atc ttc cat ga-3' and 5'-tca aac
aag ctt tta cag  xxxg889xxx  a-3' for cox-2 .8473. the
sequences of tdi (template-directed dye-terminator incorporation) probes were designed using primer 3 software [43] as
follows: forward 5'-att atg agg aga att tac ctt tcc
c-3' for cox-2 .926; reverse 5'-act tca cta tga tga
tat ggt aat t-3' for cox-2 .5209; and reverse 5'-att ttt
ctg tca tca aac aaa aac a-3' for cox-2 .8473. the
three allele-specific dye terminators used for each of the three
snps were g/c, c/a and g/a, respectively. the assay was
validated by sequencing individuals with all three genotypes,
and these known samples were used as positive controls on
each plate.

the laboratory staff was blind to the case/control status of
individuals. based on 272 duplicated quality control samples
randomly included in genotyping, an estimated error rate of
0.6% (5/816) was observed. genotyping data were available
for 1,067 (96.8%) cases and 1,110 (97.3%) controls who
donated blood, which represent 70.8% (1,067/1,508) of eligible cases and 71.3% (1,110/1,556) of eligible controls.
questionnaire data
as part of the interviewer-administered main questionnaire,
women were asked to report their intake of aspirin, ibuprofen,
and acetaminophen. for 1,028 (96.3%) cases and 1,029
(92.7%) controls, both questionnaire data and dna for genotyping were available. as previously described [5], 'ever use'
was defined as taking aspirin, ibuprofen, and/or acetaminophen at least once a week for 6 months or longer. ever use
of any one of these drugs was defined as 'ever nsaid user'.
other factors considered to be potential confounders (see
below) were also assessed as part of the in-person interview
[36].
statistical analysis
hardy-weinberg equilibrium was tested to compare the
observed and expected genotype frequencies among cases
and controls, respectively [44]. bivariate analyses were conducted to compare distributions of covariates among cases
and controls. unconditional logistic regression with sas version 9.0 (sas institute, inc., cary, nc, usa) was used to estimate odds ratios (ors) and corresponding 95% confidence

intervals (cis), adjusting for potential confounding factors
[45]. the potential confounding variables were assessed individually by comparing the log likelihood ratios derived from a
model with and without the variable [45]. factors that changed
the or estimation of the main effects of genotyping by more
than 10% were considered to be potential confounders; however, none of the covariates considered fulfilled this criterion.
variables found not to confound the associations of interest
included the following: age at menarche, parity, lactation,
months of lactation, age at first birth, number of miscarriages,
history of fertility problems, alcohol drinking, race, education,
religion, and marital status. all models were therefore adjusted
only for the frequency matching factor age at reference, by 5year age group (defined as age at diagnosis for cases and age
at identification for controls).
haplotype and diplotype frequencies were estimated from
genotype data by phase version 2.1.1 [46,47], based on
bayesian algorithm. haplotypes and diplotypes were selected
according to the corresponding occurring probabilities with a
higher likelihood (with >0.95 as the cut-point) [46,47]. the
distribution of haplotypes in the cases and controls was compared by chi2 test [48]. the most common haplotype gtt was
selected as the reference in the analysis. the risk for breast
cancer was estimated for each diplotype compared with the
reference (gtt/gtt), with adjustment for age at reference.
diplotypes were treated as categorical variables and were
incorporated as dummy variables in the logistic regression
models.
gene-environment interactions were tested by evaluating
departures from multiplicative interaction models by including
main effect variables and multiplicative interaction terms in the
logistic regression model with wald statistic [45]. because of
our prior data on the effects of nsaids by  xxxg1603xxx 
status, polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate
the ors for breast cancer, with the cases categorized by joint
 xxxg1603xxx  status (er and pr) of the tumor [45].

results
the distributions of cox-2 .5209 and cox-2 .8473 genotypes were compatible with those expected from hardy-weinberg equilibrium, and the frequencies of the variant g and c
alleles were respectively 20.0% and 34.1%. the genotype
distribution for cox-2 .926 significantly deviated from hardyweinberg equilibrium in both controls and combined cases
and controls (both p values below 0.003).
no main effects on reduced breast cancer risk were found for
the three cox-2 snps, even when women were categorized
by menopausal status (table 1). the frequency of carrying at
least one variant allele (c allele in cox-2 .926, g allele in
cox-2 .5209, or c allele in cox-2 .8473) did not differ significantly from the controls, even when breast cancer groups

were stratified based on  xxxg1603xxx  status (data not
shown).

numbers were small in these groups and no significant interaction was observed (data not shown).

haplotypes and diplotypes for the three cox-2 snps reconstructed using phase software [46] resulted in eight distinct
haplotypes and 18 diplotypes. five haplotypes and eight diplotypes were sufficiently frequent to calculate ors (table 2).
the three common haplotypes (gtt, cgc, and gtc)
accounted for more than 94.7% of the alleles. none of the
haplotypes exhibited an association with breast cancer risk in
this population. the three most frequent diplotypes were gtt/
gtt, gtt/cgc, and gtt/gtc. compared with the most
prevalent reference diplotype (gtt/gtt), an uncommon
diplotype (gtt/ggc) was associated with a 50% decreased
risk for breast cancer (adjusted or = 0.5, 95% ci = 0.2 to
0.9). the or remained unchanged when the diplotype was
compared with all other diplotype combinations. however, this
result is based on very small numbers of individuals. no strong
associations were observed between other diplotypes and
breast cancer risk.

discussion

an inverse association between ever use of aspirin and breast
cancer risk was previously reported in this population [5], and
a similar result was observed when the analyses were
restricted to women who donated blood (or = 0.80, 95% ci
= 0.65 to 0.98). when we evaluated the associations between
ever use of aspirin and breast cancer risk stratified by cox-2
genotype, the decreased or observed among ever users of
aspirin who carried at least one variant c allele of cox-2
.8473 (or = 0.7, 95% ci = 0.5 to 0.9) compared with nonusers carrying the wild-type tt genotype (table 3) was similar to
the overall or obtained from ever users of aspirin. no significant interaction was observed (p for interaction = 0.77).
when restricted to  xxxg1603xxx  positive cases, the
reduction in breast cancer risk was slightly stronger for carriers of at least one variant c allele of cox-2 .8473 who ever
used aspirin (or = 0.6, 95% ci = 0.4 to 0.9; table 4),
although the modest heterogeneity in the ors was not statistically significant. however, there was significant heterogeneity in the ors for the interaction between ever nsaid use
(including both aspirin and nonaspirin nsaid use) and carrying variant c allele of cox-2 .8473 (or = 0.7, 95% ci = 0.5
to 1.0; p for interaction = 0.02). no significant interaction
between ever use of aspirin, ever use of nsaids, and variant
c allele of cox-2 .8473 was observed in er/pr-negative
breast cancer (table 4).
when analyzed at the diplotype level, the ors of ever use of
any nsaid alone and carrying the gtt/ggc diplotype alone
were, respectively, 0.9 (95% ci = 0.8 to 1.1) and 0.6 (95% ci
= 0.2 to 1.4) compared with nonusers carrying all other diplotypes (data not shown). ever use of any nsaid was associated with a pronounced reduction in or among women
carrying the diplotype of gtt/ggc (or = 0.3, 95% ci = 0.1
to 0.9) compared with nonusers with all other diplotypes, but

the cox-2 pathway is now recognized to be important in
human cancer development and progression [49]. numerous
studies have suggested a role for cox-2 in the initiation, promotion, and progression of cancers in different organs [5052]. however, little is known about the role of sequence variation within cox-2 in breast cancer, and modification with
nsaid use [32-35]. in the present study, no overall associations between the three studied cox-2 variant alleles and
breast cancer risk were found. this finding is consistent with
an observation from a nested case-control study conducted in
danish women (361 breast cancer cases and 361 matched
controls) [35], but it is not consistent with a report that indicated that the homozygous cox-2 . 8473-cc genotype was
associated with breast cancer risk (or = 2.1, 95% ci = 1.3
to 3.3) in an austrian population (500 cases and 500 controls)
[33]. the frequencies of variant ct and cc genotypes in our
cases were similar to those in the prior studies [33,35]. we
found little evidence to suggest that intake of aspirin or ever
nsaid use interacted with cox-2 genotypes to affect overall
breast cancer risk. however, among women with hormone
receptor positive breast cancer, there was some evidence to
suggest that the reduction in risk associated with ever nsaid
use (including both aspirin and nonaspirin nsaid use) was
limited to women who carried the variant c allele for cox-2
.8473; however, there was no corresponding interaction
between this polymorphism and ever aspirin use alone in this
subgroup.
several previous studies, including the snp500 database
[53], have reported the frequency of cox-2 .8473 variant c
allele in the 3'-utr in caucasian populations to range
between 31.4% and 46.5% [19-21], which is consistent with
our finding (34.1%). our larger sample size results in a more
stable genotyping frequency compared with prior small studies. although a small previous study [20] found that carriers of
the cox-2 .8473 variant c allele had a significantly increased
risk for lung cancer (ors 2.12 for ct genotype and 4.28 for
cc genotype), an expanded study in the same population [28]
failed to reproduce the association (ors 0.96 for ct genotype and 0.97 for cc genotype). furthermore, the significantly
reduced or observed for the gtt/ggc diplotype (or = 0.5,
95% ci = 0.2 to 0.9) in the present study is probably a falsepositive finding caused by chance because of the small
number of observations (34 carriers of the diplotype with
nsaid data).
our findings on the roles of cox-2 .8473 polymorphism and
nsaids among women with  xxxg1603xxx  positive breast
cancer are biologically plausible. polymorphisms present in
the regulatory 3'-utr of cox-2 might hinder the binding of
rna-binding proteins and modulate mrna stability and deg-

radation, and finally decrease the production of protein [5456]. therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the cox-2
.8473 polymorphism, located downstream of the stop codon
in the adenylate/ xxxd870xxx -rich 3'-utr region [20], could partly
decrease mrna stability and expression either by modifying
the efficiency of polyadenylation signals or by affecting the
binding affinity of regulatory elements. this could result in

decreased cellular cox-2 activity and reduced inflammatory
response, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. continuous use of
any nsaids appears to result, via a local blockade of the
cox-2 enzyme, in a reduction in pge2 and aromatase synthesis. the consequent reduction in the local production of estrogen, in turn, is associated with the reduced breast cancer risk
[10-13,57,58]. however, the fact that there is no direct labo-

ratory evidence on the function of the cox-2 .8473 polymorphism may increase the likelihood of a spurious association or
indicate the presence of some other functional snps in strong
linkage disequilibrium with this snp.
the more pronounced interaction between the cox-2 .8473
polymorphism and ever nsaid use in er-positive or pr-positive tumors than that in er/pr-negative tumors is of particular
interest. this might be an indication that different mechanisms
are involved in subtypes of breast cancer. the lower frequency
of cox-2 over-expression in  xxxg1603xxx  positive
tumors may make it easier to observe a significant protective
effect of nsaid use among carriers of the variant c allele of
cox-2 .8473. this is consistent with the observation that elevated expression of cox-2 was statistically significantly associated with poor survival in er-positive or pr-positive tumors
but not in er/pr-negative ones [14]. the same dose of
nsaids might have a protective effect in er-positive or prpositive tumors by acting on an inflammation-related pathway
through decreasing cox-2 activity, reducing pge2 and aromatase synthesis, and decreasing estrogen production. however, there are also several discrepant reports showing that
long-term daily use of aspirin significantly increased risk for
er/pr-negative breast cancer [7], and er-negative tumors

are more sensitive to chemotherapy than are er-positive ones
[59]. we did not observe a significant interaction between
ever aspirin use, ever nsaid use, and the variant c allele of
cox-2 .8473 in er/pr-negative breast cancer, perhaps
because of limited power (table 4). the nonsignificant interaction observed in ever aspirin use might be a reflection of either
inadequate power or lack of a true association. considering
the biologic mechanism of action of aspirin and nonaspirin
nsaids and the results obtained in the present study (table
4), we believe that this inconsistency is due to limited power
resulting from the small sample size in some subgroups of
aspirin users. the observed significant interaction between
ever nsaid use and the variant c allele of cox-2 .8473 for
decreasing breast cancer risk also included, to a certain
extent, a contribution of ever aspirin use. the ors for interactions between the genotype and either ever aspirin use or ever
nsaid use were essentially similar (or 0.6, 95% ci = 0.4 to
0.9 versus 0.7, 95% ci = 0.5 to 1.0). this is consistent with
the results from our analysis of the interactions between nonaspirin nsaid use alone, aspirin use alone, and cox-2 .8473
polymorphism (data not shown). thus, the difference in interaction between ever aspirin use, ever nsaid use, and the
cox-2 .8473 polymorphism might well be the result of limited

power for subgroup analyses rather than lack of a true
association.
the relatively large sample size, population-based study
design, and availability of both genotyping and nsaid information are the strengths of the study. the nsaid data were
obtained from retrospective reporting of medication use,
which might lead to recall bias. however, in order to explain
our findings, cases should under-report more than controls or
the accuracy of reporting should be related to genotype status
or er/pr status. thus, it is unlikely that recall bias played a
major role in explaining the present findings. previous sensitivity analysis also indicated that the missing data would not have
altered the overall conclusion of a protective effect between
aspirin use and breast cancer [5].
another consideration was that our nsaids information did
not include the use of prescription drugs containing nsaids
(such as naproxen,  xxxd2065xxx ,  xxxd2423xxx , and  xxxd3259xxx ). the
presumed 'unexposed' women who used prescription nsaids

would be included in the nonuser category and lead to an
underestimation of inverse associations. such a misclassification of users as nonusers would tend to bias estimates of
nsaid effects toward the null. the extensive information collected in the study for evaluating confounding factors and
effect modifiers allowed us to assess confounding in the data
analysis. ors changed less than 10% when considering
potential confounding factors individually or in multivariate
models, indicating that the effects of confounding are limited.
inclusion of age at reference in logistic models minimized any
possible residual confounding effect of age. although our
questionnaire also included variables on duration and frequency of aspirin and other nsaid use, providing some information on dose, the small sample size in some subgroups
when categorized by cox-2 genotype limited power to evaluate dose-response effects.

conclusion
this population-based case-control study provided some evidence to support our hypothesis that the cox-2 .8473 variant

c allele may be a genetic modifier for ever use of nsaids and
reduced breast cancer risk among  xxxg1603xxx  positive
cases, but we observed no corresponding interaction with
aspirin use alone, which may be due to reduced power in this
subgroup. because there has been no laboratory evaluation of
the biologic function of cox-2.8473 polymorphism, additional
studies to examine the functionality of the polymorphism and
the potential interactions with various inflammation-related
genes are warranted.
