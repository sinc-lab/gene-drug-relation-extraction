abstract
background:  xxxd2707xxx  was approved by the us
food and drug administration (fda) in october
2005 for the treatment of t-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (t-all) and t-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma
(t-lbl) that has not responded to or has relapsed after
treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens.
objectives: this article reviews the pharmacology,
mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2707xxx . also reviewed
are  xxxd2707xxx 's clinical efficacy in t-all, t-lbl, and
other hematologic malignancies; its toxicity profile,
dosage, and administration; and areas of ongoing and
future research.
methods: relevant literature was identified through
searches of medline (1966-april 2007), international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-april 2007),
and the american society of hematology database
(2003-2006) using the terms  xxxd2707xxx ,  xxxd2707xxx ,
506u78, and 2-amino-6-methoxypurine arabinoside.
the reference lists of the identified articles were
searched for additional sources. product information
obtained from the manufacturer of  xxxd2707xxx  was
consulted, as were the fda reviews of  xxxd2707xxx . all
identified publications were considered, and those
meeting the objectives of this review were included.
results:  xxxd2707xxx , a soluble prodrug of 9-~-darabinofuranosylguanine (ara-g), is a novel purine
antimetabolite antineoplastic that preferentially accumulates in t-cells. ara-g is rapidly phosphorylated in
t-cells to ara-g triphosphate (ara-gtp), which exerts
cytotoxic effects. renal elimination of ara-g is decreased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; however, no dose adjustment is recommended.
accumulation of ara-gtp occurs in t-cells in a dosedependent manner, leading to preferential cytotoxicity.

 xxxd2707xxx  has activity in t-cell malignancies, as evaluated in 2 phase i and 5 phase ii studies. it received
accelerated approval from the fda based on the resuits of 2 phase ii trials, one in pediatric patients (pgaa
2001) and the other in adults (calgb 19801). in
pgaa 2001, patients with t-all in first relapse (n =
33) had an objective response rate of 55% (16 with a
complete response [cr] and 2 with a partial response
[pr]), and those with t-all in second relapse (n =
30) had an objective response rate of 27% (7 cr and
1 pr). among patients with central nervous systempositive t-all or t-cell non-hodgkins lymphoma
(t-nhl) (n = 21), 33% had an objective response
(5 cr and 2 pr); among patients with t-all or
t-nhl with extramedullary relapse (n -- 22), 14%
had a pr. calgb 19801 included 39 adult patients
with t-cell malignancies, of whom 7 (18%) had a
cr and an additional 2 (5%) had a cr without full
hematologic recovery. the recommended dose of  xxxd2707xxx  in adults is 1500 mg/m 2 iv given over 2 hours
on days 1, 3, and 5, repeated every 21 days; the recommended dose in pediatric patients is 650 mg/m2 iv
given over 1 hour for 5 consecutive days, repeated
every 21 days. dose-limiting toxicities observed in the
phase i and ii trials included central and peripheral
neurotoxicity. symptoms of central neurotoxicity included somnolence, seizures, dizziness, confusion, and
ataxia; symptoms of peripheral neurotoxicity included paresthesias, pain in the extremities, and peripheral neuropathy.

in t r o d u c t i o n

 xxxd2707xxx * was approved by the us food and drug
administration (fda) in october 2005 for the treatment of t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all)
and t-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (t-lbl) that has
not responded to or has relapsed after treatment with
at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. 1 before its approval,  xxxd2707xxx  had been granted orphan drug status
by the fda because of the rarity of t-cell malignancies, and it was given a fast-track designation for its
potential to address an unmet need in the treatment
of these serious, life-threatening diseases. 2 accelerated
approval was granted after  xxxd2707xxx  treatment was
associated with complete responses (crs) in 23% to
26% of patients with refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies in 2 phase ii studies. 3,4 the
children's oncology group (cog) is planning a phase
ill trial to validate the clinical benefits of  xxxd2707xxx . 5
 xxxd2707xxx  is a prodrug for 9-~3-d-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-g), a deoxyguanosine (dguo) analogue, 6 and is a member of the purine antimetabolite
class. 7 purine antimetabolites include the adenosine
analogues  xxxd2120xxx , cladribine,  xxxd1722xxx , and
 xxxd2879xxx . these agents are structural analogues of
nucleosides that halt dna synthesis once incorporated into the growing dna strand. 7 in addition to
halting dna synthesis, these compounds have properties leading to the inhibition of dna replication,
ultimately resulting in cellular death (eg, inhibition
of dna polymerase, dna primase, dna ligase, ribonucleotide reductase, and activation of caspacestriggering apoptosis). 7 the rationale for the clinical
development of an analogue to dguo for the treatment of t-cell malignancies was based on the observa-

tion that patients with purine  xxxg1792xxx 
(pnp) deficiency acquired t-cell lymphopenia. 8 pnp
catabolizes dguo; therefore, a deficiency of pnp resuits in accumulation of intracellular dguo, which is
eventually phosphorylated and leads to inhibition of
dna synthesis, dguo use is limited clinically because of
its inactivation as a consequence of the large quantity of pnp in red blood cells and large organs. ara-g,
an analogue of dguo, is resistant to phophorylysis
by pnp; however, the poor solubility of ara-g has
been a barrier to its development since it was first synthesized in 1964. technological advances in purine
arabinonucleoside synthesis led to the creation of
 xxxd2707xxx  from diaminopurine arabinoside. 8
 xxxd2707xxx  provides a treatment option for relapsed
or treatment-refractory t-cell malignancies. the
national cancer institute (nci) has estimated that
3600 children and adults are diagnosed with all
every year, and 720 of these patients have t-all. 2 for
patients with newly diagnosed t-all or t-lbl,
the stages of therapy typically consist of remissioninduction, consolidation, and maintenance treatment
with multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including a
glucocorticoid, vincristine,  xxxd230xxx , anthracycline,
methotrexate, and  xxxd2573xxx . 9 seventy-five to
80% of patients are cured with these regimens, leaving 20% to 25% with refractory or relapsed disease. 9
t-lbl is the lymphomatous variant of acute leukemia, in which extramedullary disease is more prevalent than bone marrow involvement. t-lbl is seen
in -30% of patients with non-hodgkins lymphoma
(nhl), and approximately one third of these patients
have disease that relapses or is refractory to treatment. 2
 xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd3309xxx  are promising agents for
patients with relapsed disease; however, stem-cell
transplantation is associated with the best chance of
cure. 2  xxxd2707xxx  may be a treatment option for patients
who have failed multiple therapies, including stem-cell
transplantation.

of action, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties of  xxxd2707xxx . also reviewed are  xxxd2707xxx 's
clinical efficacy in t-all, t-lbl, and other hematologic malignancies; its toxicity profile, dosage, and administration; and areas of ongoing and future research.

product information was obtained from the manufacturer of  xxxd2707xxx , as were the fda center for
drug evaluation and research reviews of  xxxd2707xxx 
(drugs@fda, available at http://www.accessdata.fda.
gov). all publications were considered, and those meeting the objectives of this review were included.
pharmacology
 xxxd2707xxx  (2-amino-9-13-d-arabinofuranosyl-6-methyoxy9h-purine) (figure) has the molecular formula
c11h1smsos and a molecular weight of 297.27. l° it
is a prodrug of ara-g 6 and is 10 times more soluble
than ara-g. 11  xxxd2707xxx  is metabolically converted to
ara-g through demethoxylation by  xxxg62xxx  (figure). 8,12 the conversion is rapid, as 94% of
 xxxd2707xxx  is converted to ara-g by the end of a
1-hour infusion. 8 ara-g is transported into cells by
nucleoside transporters 12 and then undergoes 3 phosphorylation steps resulting in the formation of ara-g
triphosphate (ara-gtp). the first phosphorylation
step, ara-g to ara-g monophospate (ara-gmp), occurs through nucleoside kinase. this is the rate-limiting
step in the formation and accumulation of ara-gtp. 13
the ara-gmp-to-ara-g diphosphate (ara-gdp) and
ara-gdp-to-ara-gtp steps occur via the phosphorylating enzymes  xxxd1836xxx  (dcyt) kinase and dguo

kinase. 13 dguo kinase and dcyt kinase are constitutively expressed in most tissues, although their specific activity occurs in different tissues: dguo kinase is
highly specific in brain tissues, whereas dcyt kinase is
highly specific in lymphoid tissue. the high specific
activity of dguo in central nervous system (cns) tissues may lead to a greater accumulation of ara-gtp in
these tissues and, thus, to neurotoxicity. 13
ara-gtp is a purine antimetabolite that is incorporated into dna to exert its s phase-specific cytotoxic
effects. 13 ara-gtp competes with endogenous deoxygtp ( xxxd1837xxx ) for incorporation into dna by dna polymerases34 once ara-gtp is incorporated at the 3' end
of dna, further dna elongation is terminated; thus,
an apoptotic signal ensues, leading to cellular destruction. 15 among other possible mechanisms for ara-gtp
accumulation is impaired function of ribonucleotide reductase due to an imbalance in deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools, leading to impaired dna synthesis. 16
studies evaluating the relative cytotoxicity of aragtp in t-cell and b-cell lines found selective 2.3- to
400-fold greater growth inhibition in t-cell lines compared with b-cell lines. 17 these preliminary findings
stimulated research in leukemia cell lines, and investigators found a selective preference for accumulation
of ara-gtp in leukemic t-lymphoblasts compared with
all other cell lines studied. 18a9

protocol study in adults. 2°
 xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g
a phase i study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g on the first day of therapy in
78 patients (49 adults, 29 pediatric patients) with refractory hematologic malignancies. 8 patients received  xxxd2707xxx  doses ranging from 10 to 75 mg/kg given over
0.75 to 2 hours each day for 5 consecutive days. pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on
 xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g serum concentrations in samples
drawn before dosing on the first day of therapy, during
the infusion (15, 30, and 45 minutes), and after completion of the infusion (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 23 hours).
the mean (sd) cmax per dose of  xxxd2707xxx  (adult:
0.49 [0.42] 1jmol/l • t~molq; pediatric: 0.51 [0.60]
tjmol/l • i~mo1-1)and ara-g (adult: 1.05 [0.28] ljmol/l •
lamol-1; pediatric: 1.00 [0.23] pmol/l . tlmo1-1) occurred at the end of the infusion. the cmax and auc0~
of  xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g were dose proportional. after
attainment of cmax,  xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g concentrations declined monoexponentially with time. 8
differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of
 xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g between adult men (n = 31) and
adult women (n = 13) were not statistically significant
for tl/2, c1, or vss.8 there were no significant differences between adult (n = 44) and pediatric patients
(n = 20) for the  xxxd2707xxx  tl/2 (16.5 and 14.1 minutes,
respectively) or the mean (sd) c1 (5.88 [8.43] and 9.26
[12.79] l • h -1 • kg-1). however, there were significant
differences between adult (n = 46) and pediatric patients (n = 25) for ara-g tl/2 (3.0 vs 2.1 hours, respectively; p < 0.01) and c1 (0.21 [0.07] vs 0.31 [0.11] l.
h -1- kg-1; p < 0 . 0 0 1 ) . although the difference in ci between adults and pediatric patients is not fully understood, the investigators concluded that it may have
been the result of age-related changes in renal function.
studies reviewed by the fda suggest that ara-g has
low plasma protein binding over in vitro concentrations of 1.78, 17.8, and 178 !ug/ml.21 the mean (sd)
percentage of plasma protein-bound ara-g was directly dependent on serum concentrations, ranging from
6.5% (6.7%) for a serum concentration of 1.78 lag/ml
to 10.6% (7.5%) for 17.8 t~g/ml and 24.4% (16.9%)
for 178 l~g/ml. in vivo data are not available.
genetic polymorphisms of  xxxg62xxx 
(ada), the enzyme that metabolizes  xxxd2707xxx  to

ara-g, may explain the observed pharmacokinetic
variability. three phenotypes have been recognized on
electrophoresis:  xxxg62xxx , ada2, and  xxxg62xxx /ada2. 21
the  xxxg62xxx  variant results in fully functional ada activity and is the most commonly observed variant in
the general population, whereas patients who have
1 copy of the ada2 allele ( xxxg62xxx /ada2) have 15%
to 20% lower ada activity compared with those who
are homozygous for the  xxxg62xxx  allele. 22,23 no published data were identified to support the hypothesis
that the variability in  xxxd2707xxx  pharmacokinetics results from genetic polymorphism of ada.
the proposed mechanism for the metabolism of
 xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g involves the conversion of  xxxd2707xxx  to ara-g through o-demethylation by ada or
 xxxd2707xxx  hydrolysis to methylguanine, followed by
o-demethylation to guanine. ara-g is hydrolyzed to
guanine, guanine is n-deaminated to xanthine, and
xanthine is oxidized to  xxxd3472xxx .  xxxd3472xxx  ring opening
and subsequent oxidation result in the development of
allantoin. 21
ara-g excretion occurs partially through renal
elimination, as indicated by the findings of 2 pharmacokinetic studies that included analysis of urine samples up to 24 hours after  xxxd2707xxx  infusion. 21 in
these studies, the mean (sd) proportion of the administered dose excreted in the urine as the  xxxd2707xxx 
breakdown product, ara-g, was 32.3% (18.9%) in
12 adults on day 1 and 22.8% (9.5%) in pediatric patients on day 1. renal elimination of ara-g is decreased by 35% and 55% in patients with mild
(creatinine clearance [crcl] 50-80 ml/min) or moderate (crci <50 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively; however, no dose adjustment is recommended
by the manufacturery
ara-gtp
ara-gtp accumulation was characterized in a
phase i multicenter trial in 19 patients with various
hematologic malignancies. 6 patients received  xxxd2707xxx  20 to 60 mg/kg daily infused over 1 hour each
day for 5 days. samples of isolated mononuclear cells
from blood samples were processed for nucleotide extraction to determine ara-gtp concentrations. aragtp cmaxwas reached at various times: at the end of
the infusion in 7 patients, 2 hours after the end of the
infusion in 8 patients, and 4 hours after the end of the
infusion in 4 patients. the median cma× of ara-gtp
in all cell lineages was 23, 42, 85, and 93 lamol/l

at doses of 20, 30, 40, and 60 mg/kg, respectively.
a greater accumulation of ara-gtp occurred in
t-lymphoblasts compared with other cell lineages, as
indicated by a median ara-gtp cmax of 150 pmol/l
in t-all cells. ara-gtp, therefore, accumulated preferentially in t-lymphoblasts in patients with t-all
and t-lymphoid chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (cml-bc); in non-t-all patients, ara-gtp accumulated in a dose-dependent fashion (r = 0.93; p <
0.001). the elimination tl/2 of ara-gtp varied from
10 to >24 hours in various cell lines.
pharmacodynamics

the relationship between accumulation of ara-gtp
in peripheral blood leukemia cells and clinical response
was studied in 16 patients, including 7 responders
(4 cr, 3 partial response [pr]) and 9 failures. 6 in the
responders, concentrations of ara-gtp ranged from
100 to 420 pmol/l (median, 150 pmol/l). the majority (85 %) of patients in the responder group had t-all
or t-lymphoid cml-bc, whereas 1 patient had b-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (b-cll). in the failure
group, concentrations of ara-gtp were significantly
lower (p < 0.005), ranging from 20 to 93 pmol/l (median, 44 inmol/l). only 1 patient in the failure group
had t-all, and the concentration of ara-gtp in this
patient was 50 pmol/l.
the positive relationship observed between accumulation of ara-gtp and clinical response provided a
rationale for additional clinical studies involving addon therapies having the potential to encourage further accumulation of ara-gtp.  xxxd2120xxx , a purine
antimetabolite adenosine analogue with ribonucleotide reductase-inhibitor properties, is thought to increase intracellular ara-gtp concentrations. 2° the
presence of  xxxd2120xxx  leads to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and a subsequent decrease in
deoxynucleotide pools, particularly deoxycytosine
triphosphate and  xxxd1837xxx . the decrease in deoxynucleotide pools upregulates the dcyt and dguo kinases. in theory, upregulation of the dcyt and dguo
kinases would lead to increased phosphorylation of
ara-g to ara-gtp and thus greater accumulation of
ara-gtp, resulting in a greater clinical response. 2°
this potentially synergistic combination was evaluated in a pilot protocol involving 13 adult patients with
hematologic malignancies (mainly indolent leukemias)
after the failure of 1 or 2 treatments.2° previous treatment included cladribine or  xxxd2120xxx . patients re-

ceived  xxxd2707xxx  1.2 g/m2 over 1 hour on days 1, 3,
and 5.  xxxd2120xxx  30 mg/m2 was infused over 30 minutes on days 3 and 5, 4 hours before administration of
 xxxd2707xxx . the relationship between cellular accumulation of ara-gtp and  xxxd2120xxx  triphosphate (f-araatp) (the activated form of  xxxd2120xxx ) was evaluated
to determine whether  xxxd2120xxx  would lead to increased concentrations of ara-gtp. the median peak
ara-gtp concentration was 84 pmol/l (range, 221420 l~mol/l); however, there was a bimodal distribution of peak ara-gtp concentrations. in contrast, the
peak median concentration of f- xxxd83xxx  was 50 pmol/l
(range, 25-160 ljmol/l), and peak concentrations did
not exhibit a bimodal distribution pattern. both ara-g
and f- xxxd83xxx  are converted to activated forms via dcyt
kinase; however, only ara-g is converted via dguo kinase. therefore, the difference in ara-gtp concentrations was thought to be the result of differences in dguo
kinase activity among patients. the addition of  xxxd2120xxx  appeared to produce a biochemical modulation in
ara-gtp concentrations (10% increase) in patients who
had low concentrations of ara-gtp after the  xxxd2707xxx 
dose on day 1; however, patients with higher concentrations of ara-gtp had residual levels of ara-gtp on day 3.
therefore, it was difficult to attribute the increase in
ara-gtp concentrations to the addition of  xxxd2120xxx .
four of 6 patients who responded to the combination of  xxxd2120xxx  and  xxxd2707xxx  had previously
failed  xxxd2120xxx  monotherapy. 2° although  xxxd2120xxx  and  xxxd2707xxx  had activity in these patients, this
trial was not able to determine conclusively that the
increase in ara-gtp concentrations resulted from the
addition of  xxxd2120xxx  to  xxxd2707xxx . patients who responded had a greater accumulation of ara-gtp
(range, 85-1420 ljmol/l; median, 890 pmol/l) compared with nonresponders (range, 22-47 t~mol/l; median, 30 pmol/l). there was no association between
concentrations of f- xxxd83xxx  and clinical response,
possibly due to less accumulation of f- xxxd83xxx .
clinical trials
phase i
kurtzberg et a124 conducted an open-label phase i
study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
(mtd), dose-limiting toxicity (dlt), and pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2707xxx . eligible patients were
aged <75 years and had a histologically or cytogenetically documented diagnosis of refractory hematologic
malignancy in relapse (t-all, t-lbl, b-cll, t-cell

chronic lymphocytic leukemia [t-cll], cml). patients
had adequate organ system function and a karnofsky
performance status of >30% or eastern cooperative
oncology group (ecog) performance status of 0 to 3.
patients were excluded if they had a history of seizure
disorder or neurologic toxicity with previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  xxxd2707xxx  administration was planned in escalating doses of 5, 10, 20, 40,
60, 75, and 90 mg/kg per day as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour for 5 consecutive days. however, dlt
was seen at 75 mg/kg per day, and the dose of 90 mg/kg
per day was never given. the protocol was amended to
include the dose of 1.2 g/m2 per day (equivalent to
30 mg/kg per day in adults and 40 mg/kg per day in
children) in 20 patients. patients were stratified into
4 groups: adult patients with leukemia, adult patients
with lymphoma, pediatric patients with leukemia, and
pediatric patients with lymphoma. all patients received standard supportive care measures, including
allopurinol, antiemetics, antibiotics, and blood and
platelet transfusions. 24 for leukemia, cr was defined
as <5% blast and recovery of peripheral counts, and pr
was determined based on various parameters, including
the percentage of blast and peripheral count recovery.
for patients with nhl, cr was defined as a disappearance of disease that was sustained for 4 weeks, and pr
was defined as a ___50% decrease in the sum of the
product of the diameters of measurable lesions that
lasted for 4 weeks.
sixty-three percent of patients were adults (n = 59)
and 37% were children (n = 34). 24 the majority (71%)
of patients were male. sixty-six percent of patients
had t-cell malignancies, 22% had b-cell malignancies,
and 13% had myeloid or other hematologic malignancies. most patients had refractory disease (proportion
not reported), having failed at least 2 previous therapies, with a mean of 3 previous regimens. twenty-nine
percent of patients had previously undergone stemcell transplantation, and almost half had received previous intrathecal chemotherapy.
no grade 3 or 4 events (pediatric oncology group
toxicity criteria) were reported during the first cycle of
therapy in pediatric and adult patients dosed at _<60 and
<30 mg/kg per day, respectively. 24 the mtd was defined as 60 mg/kg for pediatric patients and 40 mg/kg
for adults. the only dlt occurred in 1 patient receiving 75 mg/kg per day, which resulted in closure of this
dose group. the patient was a 6-year-old with neurotoxicity secondary to  xxxd2707xxx  administration. this

neurotoxicity was severe and irreversible. after nearly
12 days of  xxxd2707xxx  therapy, the child developed seizures, ascending paralysis, and coma. electroencephalography showed diffuse slowing, and electromyelography showed decreased conduction of the peroneal
nerves. the patient required mechanical ventilation for
2 weeks before recovering the ability to breathe without assistance. the patient achieved a cr lasting
6 weeks, but did not recover from the neurotoxicity
and ultimately died from progressive disease.
responses were seen across all dosing strata. 24 a
dose of 1.2 g/m2 per day (equivalent to 30-40 mg/kg
per day) was selected for future phase ii investigations
in pediatric and adult patients. among the 39 patients
with t-all or t-lbl, 23% (n = 9) had a cr and
31% (n - 12) had a pr. fifteen of these patients had
_>2 previous relapses with other treatments. three
(30%) of 10 patients with b-cll or t-cll also
achieved a pr. additionally, 1 patient with cml-bc
achieved a cr that lasted for 57 weeks before relapsing with cns disease.
gandhi et al 2° reported the results of another openlabel phase i trial in which  xxxd2707xxx  was combined
with  xxxd2120xxx  in 13 patients. the protocol was designed to test the efficacy of this combination and to
evaluate the ability of  xxxd2120xxx  to biochemically
modulate cellular ara-gtp metabolism. most patients
(46%) had b-cll, although 2 patients had t-all
(1 with cml-bc and i with mycosis fungoides in biastic transformation). all patients had been pretreated
with at least 1 chemotherapy regimen before enrollment. patients received  xxxd2707xxx  as a 1.2-g/m2 infusion on days 1, 3, and 5 and received  xxxd2120xxx 
30 mg/m2 as an infusion 1 half hour before administration of  xxxd2707xxx . the 5-day course was repeated
every 21 to 28 days. response and toxicity were evaluated according to established criteria for each disease
state evaluated. seven (54%) patients achieved an objective response. among the 6 patients whose disease
was refractory to other purine analogues ( xxxd2120xxx 
and cladribine), 4 achieved remission and 1 achieved
stable disease.
objective response rates from the phase i trials are
summarized in table i.

cog conducted a multicenter phase ii study (pgaa
2001) to determine the response rates to  xxxd2707xxx 
among children and young adults (age <21 years at diagnosis) with refractory or recurrent t-cell malignancies (t-all or t-nhl). 3 eligible patients had a predicted life expectancy of at least 8 weeks and a karnofsky
performance status of at least 50%; patients were excluded if they had preexisting neurotoxicity of grade 2
or worse from previous therapy. patients were stratified into 4 groups based on the site of disease, number
of relapses, and number of previous inductions.
stratum 1 included patients who had t-all with
>25% bone marrow blasts that was in first relapse
or was refractory to initial induction chemotherapy.
stratum 2 included patients with t-all and >25%
bone marrow blasts, with at least a second bone marrow recurrence or a first recurrence that was refractory to at least 1 reinduction cycle. stratum 3 included
patients with t-all or t-nhl with disease present in
the bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. stratum 4
included patients with t-all and t-nhl with extramedullary relapse and <25% bone marrow blasts.
 xxxd2707xxx  was initially administered as a 1.2-g/m 2
intravenous infusion over 1 hour for 5 days every
3 weeks. the dose was reduced to 650 mg/m 2 per day
as a result of  xxxd2707xxx  neurotoxicity observed in
adult patients in concurrent trials. the  xxxd2707xxx 
dose for patients in strata 3 and 4 was 400 mg/m 2.
this dose was selected for patients in strata 3 and 4 to
obtain pilot data on response and toxicity at a lower
dose; the study report noted that  xxxd2707xxx  might be
used at lower doses in combination with other cytotoxic agents in this patient population. patients with
cns disease (stratum 3) received intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate,  xxxd1790xxx , and hydrocortisone)
in addition to  xxxd2707xxx . intrathecal therapy was administered weekly for 4 weeks, starting on day 7 after

the initiation of  xxxd2707xxx ; on day 1 of weeks 6 and
9; every 6 weeks for the next 12 weeks; and then every
9 weeks for the remainder of patients' time in the study.
the cycle was to be repeated until disease progression,
unmanageable toxicity, determination that continued
treatment would no longer be beneficial, or a duration
of treatment >2 years.
the primary end points were bone marrow response
rate and early marrow response rate. 3 a complete marrow response was defined as <5% blasts occurring at
any time. a partial marrow response was defined as
<25% blasts occurring at any time during the study.
early marrow responses were defined as responses occurring at day 21 of cycle 1. secondary end points were
survival and duration of response.
one hundred six patients (median age, 11.5 years)
were assessable for response. 3 the results are reported for strata 1 and 2 at the 650-mg/m 2 dose and for
strata 3 and 4 at the 400-mg/m 2 dose. of the 33 patients with t-all in first relapse (stratum 1), the
objective response rate was 55% (16 cr and 2 pr).
of the 30 patients with t-all in second relapse (stratum 2), the objective response rate was 27% (7 cr
and 1 pr). of the 21 patients with cns-positive
leukemia or lymphoma (stratum 3), 33% achieved
an objective response (5 cr and 2 pr). finally,
among the 22 patients with extramedullary relapse
(stratum 4), 14% achieved a pr. rates of overall response differed significantly among the 4 strata (p =
0.012). although time to cns clearing was not an
objective of this trial, it is interesting to note that
8 of 22 patients with cns disease on study entry had
negative cns cytology after completion of i cycle of
 xxxd2707xxx  and before their first scheduled intrathecal
chemotherapy on day 7.
one hundred fifty-one patients received at least
1 dose of  xxxd2707xxx , and there were 31 episodes of

at least grade 3 neurotoxicity in 27 (18%) patients. 3
three of these patients developed grade 3 or higher
toxicity centrally and peripherally. there were 13 peripheral neurologic events of at least grade 3, typically manifesting as lower extremity weakness and paresthesias. peripheral neuropathies appeared to be
gradually reversible. in addition, 18 episodes of cns
toxicity of at least grade 3 were reported. four patients developed seizures while receiving  xxxd2707xxx ,
and 1 patient died from nonremitting status epilepticus. approximately one third of patients experienced
other neurotoxicities, including somnolence, headache,
hallucinations, and confusion. it is important to note
that not all neurologic adverse events were attributable to  xxxd2707xxx  toxicity. nearly all of these patients
were heavily pretreated: approximately one third of
patients receiving  xxxd2707xxx  had cns-positive disease
and were receiving concomitant intrathecal chemotherapy or other medications associated with neurotoxicity (eg, phenytoin). the toxicity resolved after
withdrawal of  xxxd2707xxx  in -60% of patients with direct drug-related toxicity.
the cancer and leukemia group b (calgb)
conducted a phase ii trial in 39 adult patients (age
___16 years) with t-cell malignancies (calgb 19801),
the results of which have been published only in abstract form. 4 patients were eligible for enrollment if
they had documented t-all or t-lbl that had been
refractory to at least 1 induction regimen or was in
first or later relapse after a cr, had no cns involvement, had no history of seizure disorder, and had developed no neurologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher
during previous treatments. patients could not enter
the study if they had residual neuropathy of at least
grade 2 at the time of registration.  xxxd2707xxx  was administered intravenously over 2 hours on days 1, 3,
and 5 of each 21-day cycle. the dose was initially
2200 mg/m 2 per day, but was modified to 1500 mg/m2
per day to decrease the risk of neurotoxicity.
the primary study end points were response rate
and duration of response. 4 for t-all, cr was defined as bone marrow blast counts _<5%, no evidence
of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood
counts. cr*, which signified a cr without full hematologic recovery (defined as bone marrow blast counts
<5% and no other evidence of disease, but with
neutrophil counts <1500 cells/1jl or platelet counts
<100,000 cells/lal), was also assessed. for t-lbl, cr
was defined as the disappearance of all measurable

disease and appearance of no new lesions. subjects
were considered to have a confirmed cr if the cr
was maintained for 1 month. secondary end points included safety, survival, and time to response.
twenty-six patients had t-all and 13 had t-lbl.4
twenty-eight patients had relapsed after at least 2 previous chemotherapy treatments or had treatmentrefractory disease after at least 2 induction attempts.
eleven patients had undergone 1 previous induction.
only 3 patients received  xxxd2707xxx  at the initial higher
dose, and their data were included in all analyses. seven
(18 %) patients achieved a cr, and an additional 2 patients had a cr* (cr + cr* = 23%). six of these patients had received at least 2 previous induction regimens, and 3 had undergone 1 previous induction.
 xxxd2707xxx  was also evaluated in a phase ii study
in adult patients (median age, 64 years) with relapsed
or refractory indolent b-cell or t-cell nhl. 2s all
patients had received at least 2 previous courses of
chemotherapy.  xxxd2707xxx  was administered intravenously as 1.5 g/m2 per day on days 1, 3, and 5 every
28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. treatment was
stopped after 4 cycles if there was no objective response (cr or pr) or there was evidence of disease
progression or emergence of unacceptable toxicity.
twenty-three patients were enrolled, 10 with t-nhl
and 13 with b-cell nhl. as reported, 19 were evaluable for response. four of 9 patients with t-nhl had
a response (2 cr and 2 pr), and 3 of 9 patients with
b-cell nhl had a response (all pr). among patients
who achieved a response, the time to progression was
8 months (range, 2-22 months).
in a phase ii study in 53 adult patients, goekbuget
et a126 evaluated the feasibility of using  xxxd2707xxx  to
induce a complete remission so patients could proceed
to stem-cell transplantation. forty-seven patients had
t-all and 6 had t-lbl. all were described as having
been heavily pretreated and had refractory disease.
thirteen percent of patients were in second relapse,
and 13% were in relapse after stem-cell transplantation.  xxxd2707xxx  was administered as 1.5 g/m2 per day
on days 1, 3, and 5.
twenty-five (47%) patients achieved a cr, 7 (13%)
had a pr, and 21 (40%) were treatment refractory.26
the majority of those with a cr (19/25) quickly underwent stem-cell transplantation (4 sibling, 14 matched
unrelated donor, 1 autologous). after a median followup of 13 months, 7 patients remained in cr, 4 died
of complications while maintaining a cr, and 14 re-

lapsed. the median time to relapse was 5 months.
although the response to  xxxd2707xxx  was promising in
this treatment-refractory population, relapse after stemcell transplantation remains a concern, and the authors recommended monitoring to target early detection
of relapse through minimal residual disease analysis.
czuczman et al, 27 in collaboration with calgb,
conducted a phase ii trial evaluating  xxxd2707xxx  in
11 patients with newly diagnosed cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ) and 8 patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral t-cell lymphoma (ptcl). patients
had to have measurable disease, no evidence of cns
lymphoma or significant neurologic dysfunction, and
an ecog performance status from 0 to 2.  xxxd2707xxx 
was administered as 1.5 g/m2 on days 1, 3, and 5
every 21 days for a minimum of 2 cycles. for those
achieving a cr, therapy could be continued for 8 cycles. the objectives of the study were to determine the
overall response rate, duration of remission, and safety of  xxxd2707xxx .
there were 2 (11%) prs to  xxxd2707xxx , one in the
 xxxg2343xxx  group and one in the ptcl group, with disease
progression occurring at 5.5 and 3 months, respectively.27 median event-free survival was 1.2 months, and
median overall survival was 3 months. because of the
unfavorable efficacy and toxicity profile of study treatment, the trial was terminated prematurely.  xxxd2707xxx 
is not recommended as monotherapy for ptcl or
 xxxg2343xxx . the efficacy and safety profile of  xxxd2707xxx 
have not been evaluated in phase iii studies to date.
objective response rates from the phase ii trials are
summarized in table ii.

toxicity

neurotoxicity--the dose-limiting toxicity
dlts observed in phase i and ii trials included both
central and peripheral neurotoxicity. 3,4,z4 central neurotoxicity was most often manifested as somnolence,
seizures, dizziness, confusion, and ataxia. peripheral
neurotoxicity was most often manifested as paresthesias, pain in the extremities, and peripheral neuropathy. 3,4,24 phase i pharmacokinetic data indicated that
neurotoxicity is associated with overall drug exposure and that patients with greater exposure (1.2- to
1.7-fold higher cmax and auc) were more likely to
develop signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity.21
auc was an independent predictor of the severity of
ataxia, seizure, and pain in the extremities, whereas
dose was a predictor of both peripheral neuropathies
and dizzinessy however, there did not appear to be
any clear relationship between dose and the severity
of toxicity seen in clinical trials. the neurotoxicity observed with  xxxd2707xxx  was similar to that seen with
other agents (eg,  xxxd1790xxx ) that may be used in this
patient population.  xxxd1790xxx  can also lead to irreversible cerebellar toxicities, which may manifest as
gait ataxia, seizures, and coma. neurologic examinations should be performed regularly during administration of  xxxd2707xxx , and the agent should be discontinued if grade 2 or higher neurotoxicities occur.
although neurotoxicity is the dlt and severe cases
resulting in irreversible neurologic compromise have
been reported, most neurotoxicity associated with
 xxxd2707xxx  has been mild, readily reversible with
discontinuation, and acceptable given the high re-

sponse rates achievable in this treatment-refractory
population. 21
in the phase i trial by kurtzberg et al, 24 67 (72%)
of 93 patients experienced neurotoxicity. in adults, neurotoxicity was most commonly manifested as malaise
and fatigue (63%), somnolence (49%), and confusion
(22%). in children, somnolence (26%) and malaise/
fatigue (24%) were the most common manifestations
of neurotoxicity. these toxicities were reversible in
85% and 50% of adults and children, respectively. in
94% of patients, symptom onset was within 12 days
of the first course of treatment. no delayed neurologic toxicities were noted. neurotoxicity appeared to be
dose dependent, particularly in the case of paresthesias and other peripheral neuropathies. seven patients
developed severe neurologic dysfunction, including
seizure, myoclonic jerks, ascending paralysis, and
coma. at the time of the final analysis, 3 of these patients recovered and 4 had irreversible damage.
among 13 patients receiving the combination of
 xxxd2707xxx  and  xxxd2120xxx  in the phase i study by
gandhi et al, 2° only grade 2 neurotoxicities were reported, including sensory neuropathy (7 patients),
somnolence (4), dizziness (2), and confusion (1).
thompson et al 2s attributed their finding of reduced
neurotoxicity with  xxxd2707xxx  (2/23 patients with
grade 3/4 neurotoxicity) to the use of an extended in-

terval of 28 rather than 21 days. in the phase ii study
by goekbuget et al, 26 neurotoxicity after stem-cell
transplantation following attainment of cr with
 xxxd2707xxx  was infrequent and reversible (agitation
and somnolence in 2 patients). grade 3/4 neurotoxicity (ataxia, vertigo, peripheral neuropathy, confusion,
and depressed consciousness) was also reported in
33% of patients in the phase ii trial of  xxxd2707xxx  in
ptcl and  xxxg2343xxx . 27
serious neurologic adverse events occurring in the
pediatric and adult pivotal trials are summarized in
table iii.

other nonhematologic toxicity
in the study by kurtzberg et al, 24 nonhematologic
toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and
anorexia) occurred at a rate of -70% and was most
common in adult patients. when  xxxd2707xxx  was combined with  xxxd2120xxx  in the study by gandhi et al, 2°
the most common nonhematologic toxicity was myelosuppression, with grade 1/2 myelosuppression and
thrombocytopenia seen in 9% and 35% of patients,
respectively. in the phase ii trial by berg et al, 3 grade
3/4 adverse events associated with  xxxd2707xxx  at all
dosing levels included infection and clinical chemistry
abnormalities. however, these adverse events could
not be attributed specifically to  xxxd2707xxx .

adverse event

hematologic toxicity
in the phase i study by kurtzberg et al, 24 16 (17%)
patients had no documented bone marrow involvement on study entry and were evaluable for hematologic toxicity. hematologic toxicity was documented
only in patients who had a diagnosis of leukemia,
achieved a cr, and continued on maintenance  xxxd2707xxx  therapy. neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were
the most common abnormalities. grade 1/2 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 50% and 76%
of children, respectively, and 46% and 42% of adults.
patients with normal bone marrow function showed no
grade 3/4 toxicity while receiving  xxxd2707xxx . in the
phase ii study in patients with refractory t-cell disease,
berg et al 3 were able to assess hematologic toxicity only
in patients in stratum 4 (extramedullary relapse and
<25% bone marrow blasts). two patients in this group
had grade 4 neutropenia and 2 had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. no other strata could be analyzed because
of bone marrow involvement.
the fda has recommended continued postmarketing surveillance of adverse events with  xxxd2707xxx . 5
this is particularly important in the case of neurotoxicity, the dlt associated with  xxxd2707xxx  use.

dosage and administration
the recommended adult dose of  xxxd2707xxx  is
1500 mg/m 2 given as an intravenous infusion over
2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, repeated every 21 days. 2
in pediatric patients, the dose is 650 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 1 hour each day for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days) the differences in
dose between adult and pediatric patients represent
differences in the doses studied in the phase ii clinical
trials in adult and pediatric patients. these doses
apply whether the indication is t-all or t-lbl, and
whether the disease is relapsed or treatment refractory.
therapy is continued until evidence of disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. in the
phase ii clinical trials leading to the approval of  xxxd2707xxx , 3,4 treatment was continued until patients experienced unacceptable toxicity, had disease progression, or
became a candidate for stem-cell transplantation.
supportive-care measures, including hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol, should
be provided for all patients receiving  xxxd2707xxx  therapy
to prevent hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome.5
 xxxd2707xxx  should be discontinued at the first sign
of neurotoxicity of nci common toxicity criteria

grade 2 or greater. the dose may be delayed or reduced in the case of other toxicities, including hematologic toxicity; however, there are currently no specific dosing recommendations.5 although  xxxd2707xxx 
has not been specifically studied in patients with compromised renal function,  xxxd2707xxx  and ara-g are excreted by the kidney in differing amounts (10% and
30%, respectively).21 because clearance may be decreased in those with reduced renal function, these patients should be monitored particularly closely for
signs of toxicity, s

future directions
phase iv commitments have been defined, including
the design of a phase iii trial to be completed by the
cog. 5 the objective of this trial will be to validate
the clinical benefits of  xxxd2707xxx . future directions
for  xxxd2707xxx  include its use in combination with
other agents as first-line therapy for t-all. a phase
iii study sponsored by the cog is currently recruiting
patients. 29
conclusions
 xxxd2707xxx , a novel prodrug of ara-g, is indicated for
the treatment of patients with t-all and t-lbl
whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed
after treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. accumulation of ara-gtp occurs in t-cells in a
dose-dependent manner, leading to preferential cytotoxicity.  xxxd2707xxx  has shown clinical activity in t-cell
malignancies in 2 phase i and 5 phase ii studies. however, it has also been associated with dose-dependent
and often profound neurotoxicity that is reversible on
discontinuation in most patients. the role of  xxxd2707xxx  as a single agent is limited, and crs may not be
durable; however, there are few treatment options for
patients with relapsed or refractory t-all. thus,
 xxxd2707xxx  may provide the opportunity for a patient
to attain a cr and subsequently undergo stem-cell
transplantation, which may prolong survival.  xxxd2707xxx  promises to be an important addition to the antimetabolite armamentarium against these rare t-cell
hematologic malignancies.
