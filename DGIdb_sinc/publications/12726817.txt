insulin inhibits rat hippocampal neurones via activation of atp-sensitive k+ and large conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels.  in this study, we have used a combination of immunocytochemical and ca(2+) imaging techniques to determine the functional localisation of insulin receptors as well as the potential role for insulin in modulating hippocampal synaptic activity. comparison of  xxxg1194xxx  and map2 labelling demonstrated extensive  xxxg1194xxx  immunoreactivity on the soma and dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurones. dual labelling with synapsin 1 also showed punctate  xxxg1194xxx  labelling associated with synapses. in functional studies, insulin inhibited spontaneous ca(2+) oscillations evoked in cultured hippocampal neurones following mg(2+) removal. this action of insulin was mimicked by the atp-sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channel opener  xxxd1868xxx  or the large conductance ca(2+)-activated k(+) (bk) channel activator ns-1619. furthermore, application of the k(atp) channel blocker  xxxd2215xxx  or the  xxxg1259xxx  inhibitors iberiotoxin or charybdotoxin attenuated the actions of insulin, whereas prior incubation with a combination of  xxxd2215xxx  and iberiotoxin completely blocked insulin action. the ability of insulin to modulate the ca(2+) oscillations was reduced by the inhibitors of mapk activation pd 98059 and  xxxd3462xxx , but not by the pi 3-kinase inhibitors  xxxd2523xxx  or  xxxd3536xxx , indicating that a mapk-driven process underlies insulin action. in conclusion, insulin inhibits spontaneous ca(2+) oscillations via a process involving mapk-driven activation of bk and k(atp) channels. this process may be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of epilepsy and certain neurodegenerative diseases.
