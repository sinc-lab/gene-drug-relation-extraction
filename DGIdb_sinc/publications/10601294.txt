extrinsic cues, which determine cell fates such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, include spatial cues such as
cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ecm)1 interaction (1),
soluble factors such as growth factors, and chemicophysical
cues exemplified by ultraviolet. these cues coordinately, antagonistically, and interdependently evoke biologic effects. for

example, growth factors could not stimulate proliferation of
nontransformed, adherent cells without cell-ecm interaction
(2, 3). in normal epidermis, keratinocyte proliferation is confined to basal cells attached to the basement membrane; however, as the cells move to suprabasal layers, they cease proliferation and undergo terminal differentiation. accordingly,
integrins, which are primarily responsible for the biological
function of cell-ecm interaction (2, 3), are mainly expressed in
the basal layer (4). when cultured keratinocytes are placed in
suspension, they also cease proliferation and terminally differentiate even in the presence of growth factors (5).
 xxxg682xxx  (egfr) activated by its
relevant ligands exerts diverse biologic actions in a variety of
tissues including epidermis. carpenter and cohen (6) first
demonstrate a vital role for egf in maintaining epidermal
homeostasis in vivo by showing that egf promotes skin maturation and multilayered thickening. targeted disruption of
egfr in mice results in a thin and immature epidermis (7, 8).
on the other hand, transgenic mice expressing an egfr dominant negative mutant selectively in the basal layer of epidermis shows marked epidermal hyperplasia (9). in cultured keratinocytes, egf stimulates proliferation (10, 11) and inhibits
the expression of differentiation markers such as keratin 10
(k10), type 1 transglutaminase ( xxxg744xxx  1) and filaggrin (10,
12–14). conversely, inactivation of egfr  xxxg2198xxx  activity induces k10 expression (14). these in vitro proliferationpromoting and differentiation-suppressing effects of egf on
keratinocytes however, could not explain an in vivo role for
egf in maintaining the balance between proliferation and
differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes.
effects of egfr activation have been primarily studied in
vitro using keratinocytes in cell-ecm interaction-conserved
2-dimensional culture, suggesting that the effects reflect the
action of egf/egfr only on epidermal basal cells. in normal
epidermis, however, most keratinocytes are situated in the
suprabasal portion, in which keratinocytes interact with each
other but not with ecm. although egfr expression is highest
in the basal layer, suprabasal cells in normal epidermis also
express egfr (15), suggesting that egf/egfr exerts a biological action on suprabasal keratinocytes, which may be distinct from that on basal keratinocytes. in fact, sakai et al. (16)
suggested a role of egf in epidermal differentiation, based on
their finding that egf/egf precursor was exclusively expressed in the granular layer of normal epidermis. as far as we
are aware, however, direct biological effects of egfr activation
in suprabasal cells have not yet been demonstrated.
in the present study, we showed that activation of egfr by
egf or transforming growth factor (tgf)-a promoted late terminal differentiation of cell-ecm interaction-disrupted keratinocytes. effects of egfr activation were apparently in contrast to those previously reported in attached keratinocytes
(10 –13). our results suggest that egfr activation in the su-

the biological effects of  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) activation may differ between epidermal
suprabasal and basal keratinocytes, since growth factors are mitogenic in adherent cells only in the presence
of cell-extracellular matrix (ecm) interaction. to investigate biological effects of egfr activation on keratinocytes without cell-ecm interaction, we cultured normal
human keratinocytes on polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate-coated plates, which disrupt cell-ecm but not cellcell interaction. the cells initially expressed keratin 10
(k10) and then profilaggrin, mimicking sequential differentiation of epidermal suprabasal keratinocytes. the
addition of egf or transforming growth factor-a promoted late terminal differentiation (profilaggrin expression, type 1 transglutaminase expression and activity, and cornified envelope formation) of the suspended
keratinocytes, while suppressing k10 expression, an
early differentiation marker. these effects were attenuated by egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor pd153035 or an
anti-egfr monoclonal antibody, whereas protein kinase c inhibitors h7 and  xxxd2195xxx  or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  abolished
profilaggrin up-regulation but not k10 suppression.
since the antidifferentiative role of egfr on cell-ecm
interaction-conserved keratinocytes has been well documented, our results indicate that the biological effects
of egfr on keratinocytes are influenced by cell-ecm
interaction and suggest that egfr activation promotes
rather than inhibits the terminal differentiation of suprabasal epidermal keratinocytes.

experimental procedures

results

egf enhances  xxxg744xxx  1 and profilaggrin expression in cellecm interaction-disrupted keratinocytes—to investigate the
biological effects of egfr activation on cell-ecm interactiondisrupted keratinocytes, we employed a suspension culture on
poly-hema-coated culture plates, which inhibit cell-ecm but
not cell-cell interaction. although single cell suspension culture
in  xxxd2609xxx  has been commonly used for studying ecm
disruption-induced keratinocyte differentiation, this method
interrupts cell-cell interaction, which is preserved in in vivo
suprabasal keratinocytes. the former method is therefore
likely to maintain keratinocytes in conditions more closely
resembling the in vivo physiological situation.
we initially prepared keratinocytes for suspension culture by
detaching keratinocytes from plates with trypsin/edta solution. both cell-ecm and cell-cell interaction were completely
distracted by this procedure. cells were then resuspended in
keratinocyte growth medium with or without egf and seeded
onto poly-hema-coated plates. ten ng/ml egf was used, since
this concentration has been shown to be optimal for proliferation of attached keratinocytes (10, 11). as shown in fig. 1, at
the beginning of suspension culture, only single cells were
observed floating on the plate. both in the absence and presence of egf, cells had started to interact with each other by 6 h
and had gathered into irregular clumps by 12 h. after 24 h in
suspension, egf-treated cells were more compactly aggregated
than untreated cells. large aggregations of cells were observed
in egf-untreated cells at 48 h, whereas egf-treated cells
continued to exhibit small, round aggregations. to become
suprabasal, epidermal basal cells must disconnect from both
ecm and other basal cells, and then re-establish cell-cell interaction. our results therefore indicate that keratinocytes in
suspension culture mimic epidermal suprabasal cells, at least
with regard to the response to extrinsic spatial cues.
we next examined differentiation marker expression by immunoblotting in suspended keratinocytes incubated for 48 h
(fig. 2a). for comparison, some cells were seeded on noncoated

cell culture and reagents—normal human keratinocytes derived
from foreskins (epipack, clonetics corp., san diego, ca) were grown in
serum-free, keratinocyte growth medium (clonetics) containing 0.1 mm
ca21 supplemented with 0.1 ng/ml egf, 60 ng/ml whole bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 mg/ml insulin, 50 mg/ml
gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml  xxxd164xxx  in a humidified incubator
with 5% co2 in air at 37 °c.
murine mabs employed were as follows: ll002, to k14 (cymbus
bioscience, southampton, uk); ll025, to k16 (medac, hamburg, germany); mab1605, to k10 (chemicon international inc., temecula, ca);
b.c1, to keratinocyte-specific  xxxg744xxx  1 (harbor bio-products, norwood,
ma); and akh1, to human profilaggrin and filaggrin (biomedical technologies, inc., stoughton, ma). fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
affinity-purified goat antibody directed against the mouse igg f(ab9)2
was obtained from cappel (cochraville, pa). all cytokines were obtained from genzyme co. (boston, ma) except for tgf-b1, which was
from roche molecular biochemicals and keratinocyte growth factor
from upstate biotechnology, inc. (lake placid, ny). inhibitors of signal
transduction intermediates used were protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitors including h7 (seikagaku co.; tokyo, japan) and  xxxd2195xxx  (calbiochem), mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)/extracellular regulated kinase (erk) kinase (mek) 1/2 inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx 
(biomol, plymouth meeting, pa), and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
inhibitor  xxxd3536xxx  (wako; osaka, japan). egfr function was
blocked by an anti-egfr mab (ab-3, calbiochem) or egfr tyrosine
kinase inhibitor pd153035 (tocris cookson, bristol, uk). all other
reagents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from sigma.
suspension culture—suspension culture on polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-hema)-coated plates was performed according to
the method of frisch and francis (3). in brief, cells were harvested with
trypsin/edta and suspended at 5 3 105 cells/ml in fresh keratinocyte
growth medium. two ml of cell suspension were incubated on 3.5-cm
dishes precoated with poly-hema in a humidified incubator with 5%
co2 in air at 37 °c. after incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 2 ml of distilled water.
three ml drops were immediately pipetted onto polylysine (0.1 mg/
ml)-coated coverslips and vacuum-dried for immunostaining. the
residual suspension was centrifuged, and the pellets were used for
immunoblotting.
cell lysis and immunoblotting—for detection of k10, k14, k16,
 xxxg744xxx  1, and profilaggrin/filaggrin, cells were homogenized in 10 mm
tris, ph 8.0, containing 9.5 m urea, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm edta. five ml of the lysate were
used for determining protein concentrations using a dc protein assay
(bio-rad). residual samples were constituted with 2% sds, 25 mm
dithiothreitol, and 5% b- xxxd26xxx  and then heated at 100 °c for
5 min. this procedure has been shown to optimize retention and detection of profilaggrin (17). extracts were electrophoresed on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gels (5–15%; ready gels j,
bio-rad). for detection of  xxxg744xxx  1 by b.c1, the gel was renatured after
electrophoresis as described previously (18). proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. transfers were incubated sequentially with mabs (1 mg/ml), biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse ig (dako,
glostrup, denmark), and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (life technologies, inc.). membrane-bound peroxidase was detected by an ecl detection kit (amersham pharmacia biotech). densitometric analysis of the luminescence intensity was performed with a
computer-assisted image analyzer (nih image).
immunostaining—indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (19). in brief, keratinocytes on coverslips were sequentially permeabilized in cold methanol and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde. after blocking with 10% normal goat serum,
cells were incubated with antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse igg and 500 ng/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi)
for nuclear counter-staining.
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)—total
rna was isolated from cultured keratinocytes by the single-step guanidinium thiocyanate method of chomczynski and sacchi (20). a geneamp rna pcr kit (perkin-elmer) was used for rt-pcr, as has been
previously described (19). in preliminary experiments, primers, rna
concentrations, and pcr cycles were titrated to establish standard
curves to demonstrate linearity, which allowed semiquantitative analysis of signal strength. the sequence of the primer pairs, 59 and 39,

respectively, were as follows: k14, tgaggaacaagattctcaca (localization of bases; 575–594) and tgtcttggtgaagaaccatt (971–
990); k10, actacaaaaccatcgatgac (2269 –2288) and gcaagttgttcatattggct (2651–2632); k16, atcaaagactacagtcccta (481–500) and acttctttgttcagctcctc (956 –937);  xxxg744xxx  1,
gattctgtctggaacttcca (1276 –1295) and gtgcttatagaggtaggtga (1626 –1607); profilaggrin, agcactcatgaacagtctga
(4153– 4172) and atgatggtttctggaagcag (4674 – 4655); and
b-actin, ggcccagagcaagagaggca (212–231) and gtgtcc atcacgatgccagt (505– 486). the product size was 416 bp for k14, 383
bp for k10, 476 bp for k16, 351 bp for  xxxg744xxx  1, 521 bp for profilaggrin,
and 294 bp for b-actin.
cornified envelope content—cornified envelope (ce) content of the
cultures was determined using a method utilizing the envelope insolubility (21). cells were suspension-cultured for various periods of time
and harvested in 2% sds solution. after light sonication (5 s), aliquots
were taken for protein determination with the dc assay. cells were
dissolved in 2% sds, 20 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 1 h, and
amounts of insoluble cross-linked envelopes were quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm. ce content was then expressed as
a340/mg of cell protein of triplicate wells.
transglutaminase activity—membrane-associated transglutaminase was isolated as outlined previously (22). to determine  xxxg744xxx 
activity in keratinocytes, we used a nonradioactive microtiter plate
assay (23). a kinetic measurement of absorbance at 405 nm was determined at 30 s intervals for a period of 30 min using an el 340 bio
kinetic reader (bio-tek instruments inc., winooski, vm) and analyzed
by delta-soft ii software (biometallics inc., princeton, nj). transglutaminase activity was expressed as units of optical density (mod/min).
statistical analysis—data from triplicate experiments were analyzed with the student’s t test. two other independent experiments
were performed and gave identical results (statistically significant
differences). a p value of ,0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

egfr in keratinocyte differentiation

fig. 2. egf up-regulates  xxxg744xxx  1 and profilaggrin but suppresses k10 expression induced by suspension. a, differentiation
marker expression in keratinocytes suspension-cultured for 48 h on
poly-hema-coated plates was examined by immunoblotting as described under “experimental procedures.” for comparison, some cells
were seeded on noncoated plates and incubated for 48 h (attached keratinocytes (kc)). b, keratinocytes were suspension-cultured on poly-hema for
indicated periods of time in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml egf. k10

plates instead of poly-hema-coated plates and incubated for
48 h (attached cells in figs.). k14 expression was not altered by
suspension or egf. k10 was not observed in attached cells but
was strongly induced by suspension without egf. however,
k10 could be detected in attached cells when higher amounts of
proteins were loaded (fig. 2b). k10 induction by suspension
was markedly attenuated by egf. a weak  xxxg744xxx  1 expression
was observed in attached keratinocytes and augmented by
suspension. egf augmented  xxxg744xxx  1 expression in suspended
keratinocytes. although the enhancement of  xxxg744xxx  1 expression by suspension or egf was relatively weak, the effect was
reproducible, and a significant difference was confirmed by
densitometric analysis of signal intensity (data not shown).
profilaggrin expression was more clearly modulated by suspension and egf. although profilaggrin was not detected in attached keratinocytes, it was expressed by suspended keratino-

cytes, and egf augmented the expression. however, filaggrin
(fig. 2a, size at open arrowhead) was not detected in suspended
keratinocytes in the absence or presence of egf, confirming
the absence of filaggrin induction in submerged cultured human
keratinocytes (24). induction of k6/16, which are expressed instead of k1/10 in hyperproliferative suprabasal keratinocytes
(25), has been demonstrated in cultured keratinocytes by egf
and tgf-a (26). although suspension could induce k16 expression, egf was ineffective in suspension-induced k16 expression.
since egf remarkably affected the expression of k10 and
profilaggrin in suspended keratinocytes, we analyzed the time
course of k10 and profilaggrin expression by suspension culture on poly-hema. although k10 was detected from the suspended keratinocytes before incubation (fig. 2b), k10 up-regulation was evident after 24 h of incubation. in this
immunoblot data and fig. 8, anti-k10 mab detected two bands
at 59 and 67 kda. the former (fig. 2, lower band) was identical
in molecular weight to k10, whereas the latter (fig. 2, upper
band) had a molecular weight identical to k1. in addition,
signal intensity of this band was enhanced by suspension. it is
then highly likely that the band is k1. profilaggrin expression
was more delayed and detected 48 h after incubation commenced. these results showed that k10 and profilaggrin were
sequentially expressed after the suspension. in addition, we
simultaneously examined the time course of egf-induced modulation of k10 and profilaggrin expression (fig. 2b). egf almost completely blocked k10 up-regulation, whereas (probable) k1 expression was increased 24 h after suspension despite
the presence of egf. however, k1 expression was not detected
at 48 h. although egf up-regulated profilaggrin expression at
48 h, egf could not shorten the period required for profilaggrin
expression to become detectable by immunoblotting. however,
when keratinocytes were cultured in suspension for 96 h, levels
of profilaggrin expression were comparable between egftreated and untreated cells and higher than at 48 h of incubation (data not shown). therefore, it is plausible that egf
promotes suspension-induced profilaggrin expression.
enhancement of  xxxg744xxx  1 expression by egf was weak compared with profilaggrin. however, detection of  xxxg744xxx  1 in immunoblots by the mab b.c1 requires a specific technique of
renaturation before protein transfer. this complexity might
have obscured differences in  xxxg744xxx  1 expression. we then
compared the expression of differentiation markers including
 xxxg744xxx  1 more directly by immunofluorescence staining (fig. 3),
which also revealed the localization of markers. to accurately
assess expression, cells were nuclear-stained with pi. two days
after incubation, k10 was detected in most aggregated cells,
whereas some single cells did not express k10.  xxxg744xxx  1 was
also predominantly expressed in cellular aggregations, but the
fluorescence was weaker than for k10. profilaggrin was detected in only a few cells located mainly at the central portion
of large cell aggregates. when cells were suspension-cultured
with egf, k10 expression was almost negligible. in contrast,
 xxxg744xxx  1 expression was markedly enhanced, and localization
at cell-cell contacts was visible. profilaggrin expression was
also enhanced, and most of the cells in aggregates expressed
profilaggrin. because of the weak fluorescence of profilaggrin,
relatively long exposure times were required to detect profilaggrin in egf-untreated cells, resulting in more intense pi fluorescence than in egf-treated cells, which showed intense
green fluorescence for profilaggrin despite weak pi signals.
egf enhances suspension-induced ce formation and  xxxg744xxx 
1 activation—in addition to differentiation marker protein expression, we examined the effects of egf on other markers of
differentiation including ce formation and  xxxg744xxx  1 activity.

the absence or presence of egf (fig. 4a). when cells were
cultured in suspension for 48 h, ce formation was detected in
egf-free conditions. the addition of egf significantly upregulated ce formation (p , 0.01).
membrane-associated  xxxg744xxx  activity, which is largely dependent on  xxxg744xxx  1 (27), was investigated 24 h after suspension (fig. 4b). for comparison, membrane-associated  xxxg744xxx 
activity in attached keratinocytes cultured in high calcium (1.5
mm) for 48 h was analyzed. attached keratinocytes, seeded on
plates and incubated for 24 h, showed weak membrane-associated  xxxg744xxx  activity that was not modulated by the presence of
egf. in contrast, attached keratinocytes cultured for 48 h at
high calcium exhibited high  xxxg744xxx  activity. when keratinocytes were suspension-cultured for 24 h without egf, the
 xxxg744xxx  activity was up-regulated at levels comparable with
attached keratinocytes in high calcium. the addition of egf
augmented  xxxg744xxx  activity to levels in excess of those of attached keratinocytes in high calcium medium (p , 0.01).
next, we examined the time course of terminal differentiation
of suspended keratinocytes in response to egf. since ce is an
end product of terminally differentiated keratinocyte in culture,
we monitored the time course of ce formation (fig. 4c). when
keratinocytes were suspension-cultured without egf, ce formation progressed up to 96 h incubation, whereas in the presence of
egf, the level of ce formation increased up to 72 h incubation
and then reached a plateau. the final (maximal) level of ce
formation was comparable between egf-untreated and -treated
keratinocytes. these results suggest that egf accelerates the
suspension-induced terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.

egf modulates steady-state mrna levels of differentiation
markers in suspended keratinocytes—to determine the mechanism of differentiation-modulating effects of egf, we examined steady-state mrna levels of differentiation markers in
keratinocyte suspension cultured for 24 h by rt-pcr (fig. 5).
b-actin, k14, and k16 mrna levels (cdna amplified for 25
cycles) were identical among suspended keratinocytes with and
without egf and attached keratinocytes. the k10 mrna level
was higher in suspended keratinocytes without egf than in
suspended keratinocytes with egf or attached keratinocytes.
in contrast,  xxxg744xxx  1 and profilaggrin mrna levels were upregulated in suspended keratinocytes with egf compared with
attached keratinocytes. however, suspended keratinocytes
without egf did not exhibit up-regulated mrna levels of
 xxxg744xxx  1 or profilaggrin.
egfr activation mediates differentiation-modulating effects of egf—we then confirmed the role of egfr in the
differentiation-modulating effects of egf. although profilaggrin was not detected in suspended keratinocytes (fig. 6), egf
clearly up-regulated profilaggrin expression as detectable by
immunoblotting. the anti-egfr mab, which inhibits binding
of egf to egfr, suppressed both egf-induced profilaggrin
expression and k10 down-regulation. pd153035, which selectively inhibits protein- xxxg2198xxx  activity of egfr, also
suppressed the effects of egf on k10 and profilaggrin expression. moreover, pd153035 completely attenuated egf-induced
enhancement of ce formation and membrane-associated
 xxxg744xxx  activity in suspended keratinocytes (fig. 7).
we also examined the response of keratinocytes to tgf-a,

which, like egf, interacts with and activates egfr and is one
of the physiological ligands of egfr in epidermal keratinocytes. expression of k10 and profilaggrin was blocked and
induced, respectively, in response to tgf-a, whereas tgf-b1,
which inhibits both differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes, had no effect on k10 and profilaggrin expression of
suspended keratinocytes (fig. 6). in addition, tgf-a enhanced
ce formation and membrane-associated  xxxg744xxx  activity in suspended keratinocytes, which were also reverted by pd153035
(fig. 7). furthermore, keratinocyte growth factor, a potent modulator of keratinocyte proliferation/differentiation, could not
modulate k10 and profilaggrin expression (data not shown).
h-7 and  xxxd1169xxx  selectively suppressed up-regulation of
profilaggrin expression by egf—to investigate intracellular
signaling pathways mediating differentiation-modulating effects of egfr activation, various inhibitors of intracellular
signaling intermediates were cocultured with egf in suspended keratinocytes (fig. 8).
since it has been revealed that pkc selectively participates
in late terminal differentiation of keratinocytes (28, 29), the
transition from spinous to granular layer, we first examined
the role of pkc in egf-induced profilaggrin expression, one of
the most reliable markers of granular cell differentiation. keratinocytes were suspension-cultured in the presence of egf
with or without h-7, a selective inhibitor of pkc activity. h-7

on poly-hema-coated plates for 48 h in the presence or absence of
cytokines (10 ng/ml each). pd153035 (250 nm) or anti-egfr mab (3
mg/ml) was added to the suspended keratinocytes 30 min before the
addition of egf. k10 and profilaggrin expression was examined by
immunoblotting as described under “experimental procedures.”

apparently inhibited egf-induced profilaggrin expression. although  xxxd2925xxx -induced activation of pkc could repress k1/10 mrna expression in keratinocytes (28), the suppression of k10 expression by egf was not
abrogated by h-7. in addition, other pkc-specific inhibitor
 xxxd2195xxx  (1 mm) also inhibited egf-induced profilaggrin expression but not k10 suppression (data not shown).
the ras/raf/mek/mapk pathway and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated pathway have both been shown to be
triggered by egfr activation (30). we therefore inhibited
these pathways using a mek inhibitor ( xxxd1169xxx ) and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor ( xxxd3536xxx ), respectively.
 xxxd1169xxx  alone did not modulate k10 or profilaggrin expression in suspended keratinocytes, whereas  xxxd3536xxx  alone
enhanced suspension-induced profilaggrin expression without
any effect on k10 expression.  xxxd1169xxx  inhibited egf-induced
profilaggrin up-regulation but not k10 suppression, whereas
 xxxd3536xxx  could not modulate the effect of egf on profilaggrin or k10 expression.

on poly-hema-coated plates in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml either egf or tgf-a with or without pd153035 (250 nm). after 48 and 24 h
of incubation period, ce formation (a) and membrane-associated  xxxg744xxx  activity (b) was measured, respectively, as described under “experimental
procedures.”

discussion

our findings that egf enhanced expression of late phase
differentiation markers in suspended keratinocytes are in apparent contrast with previously reported effects of egf on
attached keratinocytes (10 –13). since growth factors are mitogenic only if the cell-ecm interaction is preserved (2, 3), biological effects of egf appear to be drastically changed by
disrupting cell-ecm interaction. it has been suggested that
coexistence of other signals could change the biological activity
of egf from proliferative to differentiative. for example, egf
alone is mitogenic in pc12 cells, whereas the combination of
camp and egf induces neuronal differentiation in those cells
(31). tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kda membrane-asso-

fig. 8. signal transduction inhibitors modulate profilaggrin
but not k10 expression in suspended and egf-treated keratinocytes. keratinocytes were suspension-cultured on poly-hemacoated plates for 48 h in the presence or absence of h7 (40 mm),  xxxd1169xxx 
(50 mm), or  xxxd3536xxx  (1 mm). 10 ng/ml egf was added 30 min after
the addition of inhibitors. k10 and profilaggrin expression was examined by immunoblotting as described under “experimental procedures.”

ciated protein by disrupting a6b4 integrin-mediated anchorage
of human keratinocytes to laminin 5 suggests that ecm disruption induces intracellular signaling (32). conversely, the
binding of a6b4 integrin to laminin 5 activates the ras-mapk
pathway in keratinocytes (33). therefore, egf in combination
with the signal(s) induced by loss of cell-ecm interaction or
with the attenuation of signal(s) triggered by cell-ecm interaction might enhance late terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. in conjunction with the previous reports such as the
exclusive immunoreactivity of egf/egf precursor in the granular layer of epidermis (16) and the ability of egf to potentate
the antiproliferative and differentiative activity of  xxxd408xxx  in cultured keratinocytes (34), our results
suggest that egf promotes the terminal differentiation of the
keratinocytes, which has been already committed to undergo
terminal differentiation process.
the effects of egf on differentiation of suspended keratinocytes seem to reflect in vivo activation of egfr in suprabasal
keratinocytes, since (i) the suspended keratinocytes initially
expressed k10 followed by profilaggrin expression, which mimics the characteristic gradual differentiation in epidermis, although the time course was shortened compared with normal
epidermis, (ii) changes of extrinsic spatial cues in keratinocytes
of our culture system imitated those observed during basal
cells transit to suprabasal cells, and (iii) the effects of egf
were duplicated by tgf-a, one of the physiological ligands for
egfr in epidermal keratinocytes, and were inhibited by
pd153035, a specific inhibitor of protein- xxxg2198xxx  activity of egfr and by anti-egfr mab, which blocks the binding
of egf to egfr. therefore, egfr activation in the suprabasal
layer may promote late terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. the effect of egfr activation appears to be compensatory for the proliferation-enhancing effects of egfr activation
in the basal layer to maintain homeostasis of the epidermal
architecture, which has been suggested by in vivo studies using
egfr gene expression-manipulated mice (7–9).
ligand-activated egfr transduces diverse intracellular signaling cascades (30). complete abolition of egf-induced profilaggrin up-regulation by h7 and  xxxd2195xxx  indicates that pkc mediates profilaggrin up-regulation by egf.
this result is consistent with the selective requirement of pkc
for granular cell differentiation in cultured keratinocytes (28,
29). although egfr activation in attached keratinocytes could
not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase c (35),
which is crucial for egfr-mediated pkc activation in other
cell types (30, 36), tgf-a activates pkc in keratinocytes by
increasing the release of  xxxd208xxx  (35). however, pkc
activation by tgf-a was weak compared with that by phorbol
ester (35), which induces terminal differentiation of attached
keratinocytes. therefore, differentiation-suppressing signaling

from the cell-ecm interaction might extinguish the differentiation-promoting signals from egf. in fact, egf could transiently elevate  xxxg744xxx  1 and  xxxg1217xxx  mrna levels in attached keratinocytes without inducing their protein synthesis
(12). moreover, since egf could enhance cell-ecm interaction
by augmenting integrin expression (37), egf might suppress
its own differentiation-promoting activity when cell-ecm interaction is conserved.
in addition to pkc suppression, inactivation of mek also
reverted egf-induced profilaggrin up-regulation in suspended
keratinocytes. in general, the raf/mek/mapk cascade is positively regulated by pkc and could mediate the biologic action
of pkc (38). in keratinocytes, pkc can activate both mapk
(39) and the  xxxg1222xxx  family, which regulates
the expression of late differentiation markers (40). since egfactivated mapk can induce transactivation of ap-1 activity
(41) and positively regulate the differentiation of various cell
types (42, 43), cooperation of pkc and mapk cascades might
mediate egf-induced profilaggrin up-regulation.
although pkc activation by 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate has been shown to suppress k10 expression in attached
keratinocytes (28), neither h7 nor  xxxd2195xxx  reverted egf-induced k10 suppression in suspended keratinocytes. this suggests that egf inhibits k10 expression via
signaling intermediates other than pkc or by h-7- and  xxxd2195xxx -insensitive pkc isoforms. since k10 expression is also suppressed by egf in attached keratinocytes (10)
and the inactivation of egfr induces k10 expression of the
cells (14), cell-ecm interaction could not affect the egfr signaling, which regulates k10 expression. however, the responsible signaling pathway is unknown. in suspended keratinocytes, the suppressive effect of egf on k10 expression was not
reverted by inhibition of mek or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
activities, suggesting that other signaling intermediates such
as signal transducers and activators of transcription (stats)
(30) might be responsible for k10 suppression by egf.
in addition to the loss of cell-ecm interaction, an increase in
intracellular free calcium has been suggested to mediate suspension-induced keratinocyte differentiation (44). since egf
elevates the levels of intracellular free calcium in keratinocytes
(45), egf might promote suspension-induced late terminal
differentiation by enhancing calcium mobilization. however, it
is difficult to confirm this speculation, since the chelation of
intracellular calcium completely suppressed suspension-induced k10 and profilaggrin expression in our culture system
(data not shown) and in others (44), and egf-induced calcium
mobilization could not be selectively inhibited.
it was very recently demonstrated that phospholipase c
signaling pathway by egf was largely dependent on the existence of egfr on cell surface, compared with other egfrinduced signaling (46). since suspension-induced drastic
changes of cytoskeletal organization has the possibility to impair
the internalization of ligand-bound egfr, activated egfr-mediated phospholipase c signaling and the resultant pkc activation
might be augmented in suspended keratinocytes.
