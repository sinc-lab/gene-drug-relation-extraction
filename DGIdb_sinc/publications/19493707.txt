the aim of the present study was to determine drug-␣1d adrenergic receptor (ar) afﬁnity by frontal
analysis of cell-membrane chromatography (cmc). the cell-membrane stationary phase (cmsp) was
prepared by immobilizing rat aorta cell membranes on porous silica, and the resulting cmsp was used
to determine drug binding afﬁnity to ␣1d -ar by frontal analysis. the cmsp of rat aorta was stable
and reproducible. relative binding afﬁnities (dissociation constant, kd ) were determined by frontal
chromatography for  xxxd3000xxx  (166.13 ± 18.36 nmol), bmy7378 (537.40 ± 30.84 nmol),  xxxd2914xxx 
(646.92 ± 23.17 nmol), 5-methylurapidil (725.66 ± 25.48 nmol), oxymetazoline (910.56 ± 40.62 nmol) and
 xxxd2601xxx  (1299.27 ± 51.73 nmol). these results were consistent with the afﬁnity rank order and
showed a good correlation with the afﬁnity of the same compounds for the cloned ␣1d -ar subtype
obtained from radioligand-binding assay. the study demonstrates that frontal analysis of cmc may be
used for direct determination of drug–receptor binding interactions, and that cmc is an alternative reliable
method to quantitatively study ligand–receptor interactions.

1. introduction
cell-membrane chromatography (cmc), a novel bioafﬁnity
chromatographic technique originated by he et al. in 1996 [1–3],
can be applied to the study of drug–receptor interactions. in previous studies [4–6], human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells
that expressed cdna of ␣1a , ␣1b or ␣1d adrenergic receptor (ar)
subtypes were cultured, and the cell-membrane stationary phase
(cmsp) was prepared by immobilizing cell membranes on the surface of silica, which acted as carrier. then, the interactions between
nine ligands of the ␣1 -ar and ␣1a , ␣1b or ␣1d -ar in the cmsp
were investigated using cmc. the ligand–receptor afﬁnity was
shown by chromatographic parameters (capacity factor, k ). the
results of the above studies showed that the prepared cmsp and
cmc method were useful in evaluating drug–receptor afﬁnity. in
addition, the ligand-binding afﬁnity to muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor has been evaluated by cmc by immobilizing rat cerebral
cell membrane and guinea pig jejunum membrane on the surface of a silica carrier [7,8]. these results have also shown that
cmc can be used to evaluate drug–receptor afﬁnity of drug candidates.
functional assay and radioligand-binding assay undoubtedly
contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between

ligands and receptors, but they have some disadvantages. cmc is
expected to become a reliable method to study ligand–receptor
interactions. however, cmc have been not used to assay drug dissociation constant (kd ) and total receptor (bt ) exactly and directly,
compared with radioligand-binding assay (rlba) and functional
assay. to improve cmc, we combined it with frontal afﬁnity chromatography to determine kd and bt .
the ␣1 -ar, which is activated by adrenaline and noradrenaline,
is a membrane protein and a member of the g-protein coupled
receptor superfamily. according to recommendations from nciuphar, based on pharmacological and molecular evidence, the
␣1 -ar is divided into three subtypes: ␣1a , ␣1b and ␣1d [9]. the
␣1 -ar family is of particular therapeutic interest because its constituents mediate a variety of physiological effects in many tissues,
such as neurotransmission, vasoconstriction, cardiac inotropy and
chronotropy, and glycogenolysis. in the past two decades, with
the cloning of three ␣1 -ar subtypes, there was a great thrust to
understand the expression of ␣1 -ar subtypes. the ␣1d subtype is
expressed in a variety of tissues, including vascular smooth muscle,
cerebral cortex [10,11], and probably rat lung [12]. in rat aorta and
iliac artery, it appears to be the predominant subtype that mediates
vasoconstriction [13,14].
the aim of this research was to prepare the rat aorta
cell-membrane stationary phase, determine the afﬁnity (kd ) of
drug-␣1d adrenergic receptor interaction and total receptor (bt ) by
frontal analysis, and create an alternative reliable method to study
quantitatively ligand–receptor interactions.

2. experimental
2.1. chemicals
 xxxd3000xxx , 8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8azaspirol[4,5]decane-7,9-dionedihydrochloride (bmy7378), 5-methylurapidil, oxymetazoline,  xxxd2914xxx , and  xxxd2601xxx 
were purchased from sigma–aldrich, inc. (st. louis, mo, usa);
n-(2-(2-cyclopropylmethoxy)ethyl)-5-chloro-␣-dimethyl-1h-indole-3-thylamine (rs17053) was provided by tocris bioscience
(ellisville, mo, usa). macroporous spherical silica (7 ␮m, 100 å)
was purchased from the institute of chemistry of the chinese
academy of sciences (beijing, china). the water used in the study
was prepared using a milli-q water puriﬁcation system (milli-pore,
bedford, ma, usa).
2.2. animals
sprague–dawley rats (5–7 weeks old) were supplied by the
experimental animal centre of xi’an jiaotong university (xi’an,
china). all experimental protocols involving animals were reviewed
and approved by the institutional animal experimentation committee of xi’an jiaotong university.
2.3. membrane preparation
rats were sedated with co2 and decapitated. the rat aorta was
removed immediately, washed thoroughly, cut into small pieces,
and added to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; 8.0 g l−1
nacl, 1.15 g l−1 na2 hpo4 , 0.2 g l−1 kcl, 0.2 g l−1 kh2 po4 , ph 7.0).
the tissue suspension was then homogenized at 4 ◦ c (twice, each
time for 1 min) with a polytron homogenizer equipped with a
pt35st probe. the crude homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g
to remove cellular debris. the supernatant was centrifuged for
20 min at 12 000 × g (hermel zk401 high-speed refrigerated centrifuge; berthold hermel ag, gosheim, germany). the buff-colored
layer around the pellet was gently re-suspended in the above buffer,
and centrifuged as before. all procedures were performed at 4 ◦ c.
2.4. preparation of cmsp
the cmsp was prepared by immobilizing the rat aorta cell membranes on the surface of silica (7 ␮m, 100 å), which acted as a carrier,
and was used for rapid on-line chromatography. the preparation
procedure was similar to that described previously [1,2]. in brief,
600 mg macroporous spherical silica activated at 120 ◦ c was placed
in a 10-ml reaction tube, followed by a suspension of rat aorta
cell membranes (generally, the concentration of membrane protein was about 2.12 mg ml−1 ). the adsorption of the rat aorta cell
membranes to the activated silica surface took place at 4 ◦ c, until
equilibrium was reached. the whole adsorption process was carried out under vacuum and ultrasonication. the reaction mixture
was diluted with an equal volume of deionized water. the cellmembrane phospholipids were able to fuse spontaneously with
each other (self-fusion) on the silica surface in the aqueous solution,
until a resealed cell-membrane layer was obtained. the residual
free cell membranes were washed with tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4).
the prepared cmsp particles in the buffer were packed into a chromatography column (10 mm × 1.2 mm i.d.) under low pressure, by
the slurry method.
2.5. chromatographic system
the hplc system consisted of an scl-10avp system controller,
an lc-10atvp pump, and an spd-10avp uv–vis detector (shimadzu,

kyoto, japan). the data were acquired by lcsolution software (version 1.0, shimadzu, kyoto, japan). the mobile phase consisted of pbs
(5 mm, ph 7.4) and ligand, and the ﬂow rate was 0.2 ml min−1 . the
ligands were detected using uv absorption at 278 nm (bmy7378,
 xxxd2914xxx  and rs17053), 250 nm ( xxxd3000xxx ), 282 nm (oxymetazoline), 284 nm (5-methylurapidil), or 292 nm ( xxxd2601xxx ). the
column was placed into a column oven at a temperature of 37 ◦ c.
2.6. frontal chromatography studies
all ligands were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of
10 mm as stock solutions, and further diluted with pbs to obtain
a chromatographic mobile phase that contained serial concentration of ligands (oxymetazoline, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 nm;
5-methylurapidil, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 nm;  xxxd3000xxx , 80,
100, 200, 300 and 400 nm;  xxxd2914xxx , 400, 600, 700, 800
and 1000 nm; bmy7378, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 nm;  xxxd2601xxx , 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 nm). the chromatographic
mobile phase was degassed before use. frontal analysis was performed using the chromatographic mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of
0.2 ml min−1 . a correction for the system void time was made by
performing similar experiments using acetone as a non-retained
solute. the retained compounds were eluted and the column regenerated between studies by passing pbs through the column. all
experiments were performed in triplicate under each set of tested
conditions.
2.7. calculation of dissociation constants and binding sites
frontal afﬁnity chromatography can be used to characterize the
binding of small molecules to an immobilized membrane-bound
target and to determine binding afﬁnities (kd ) and total receptor (bt ). kd was calculated using a previously described approach
[15–17]. in brief, kd , as well as bt of the immobilized cell membrane
of the rat aorta can be calculated using eq. (1):
[d] × (v − vmin ) = bt × [d] × (kd + [d])−1

(1)

where [d] is the concentration of ligand, v is the retention volume
of ligand measured at the midpoint of the breakthrough curve, and
vmin is the retention volume of ligand at the highest applied concentration of the displacer ligand. v and vmin were calculated using a
previously described approach [18]. from the plot of [d] × (v – vmin )
versus [d], ligand kd can be obtained. the data were analyzed
by non-linear regression with the sigmoidal response curve using
graphpad prism 4 software (graphpad software, la jolla, ca, usa).
2.8. statistical analysis
the relation between the calculated kd and the afﬁnities of
agents (published pki values obtained from rlba at clonal a1d -ar)
for the receptor subtype were analyzed by correlation analysis. correlation constants (r2 ) were calculated by linear regression analysis
using graphpad prism 4. all data were expressed as means ± sd and
p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. results
3.1. activity and speciﬁcity of the cmsp column
in the cmc experiment, because the silica surface was completely coated by cell membranes in cmsp, the ligand–cmsp
interaction can reﬂect the ligand–receptor afﬁnity of the cell membrane. in rat aorta, the a1d -ar appears to be the predominant
subtype that mediates vasoconstriction. therefore, the selective
␣1d -ar agents should have high afﬁnity for the cmsp of the rat

1835

in this part of the study, the washing protocol was also optimized. for high-afﬁnity compounds such as  xxxd3000xxx  and bmy7378,
the column must be washed with the chromatographic buffer
between each run for a minimum of 6 h to completely remove the
bound ligand.

aorta, and the selective ␣1a -ar or ␣1b -ar agents should have
low afﬁnity. the activity and speciﬁcity of cmsp of the rat aorta
were investigated by frontal analysis experiments with rs17053
and bmy7378. bmy7378 is a highly selective, high-afﬁnity ␣1d -ar
antagonist; rs17053 is a selective ␣1a -ar antagonist, which has low
afﬁnity for ␣1d -ar by functional assay and rlba. in this experiment,
an 800 nm solution of bmy7378 or an 800 nm solution of rs17053 in
chromatographic buffer was applied to the cmsp column of the rat
aorta (chromatographic bed 10 mm × 2.0 mm i.d.) at 0.2 ml min−1 ,
and the characteristic frontal chromatographic curves were monitored by uv–vis detection at 278 nm. fig. 1 clearly shows that the
selective ␣1d -ar antagonist bmy7378 had strong retention in the
cmsp column of the rat aorta, but the selective ␣1a -ar antagonist
rs17053 had almost no retention. this indicated that the immobilized cmsp of the rat aorta was active, and the speciﬁc interaction
was present in the immobilized cmsp, which was the ligand–␣1d ar interaction.
3.2. chromatographic conditions
phosphate is one of the main components of cellular ﬂuid. in
mammals, cellular ﬂuid has a ph in the range 6.9–7.4, and phosphate buffer is effective in maintaining this ph range. being the
mobile phase of the cmc system, pbs can simulate the cellular
micro-environment. the interaction between ligand and immobilized receptors in the cmc system can simulate the fundamental
processes of drug action more exactly and precisely. therefore,
pbs (ph 7.4) was selected as the mobile phase for the cmc
system. to reach equilibrium between ligand and immobilized
receptors in the cmc system, a ﬂow rate of 0.2 ml min−1 was
selected. the ligands were detected at the wavelength of absorption
maximum.
under these chromatographic conditions, an 800 nm solution of
bmy7378 in chromatographic buffer was applied to the cmsp column of the rat aorta (chromatographic bed 10 mm × 2.0 mm i.d.)
at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h, and the characteristic frontal chromatographic curves were monitored by uv–vis detection at 278 nm. the
obtained retention volume is shown in table 1. this indicated that,
under these chromatographic conditions, the cmsp was stable over
a 48 h period.

the fac analysis time depends on ﬂow rate, column length, column inner diameter and the immobilized protein density. in cmc,
the immobilized protein density should be constant, because protein of cell membrane is constant. in our previous experiment,
a 50 mm × 2.0 mm i.d. chromatography column was selected to
study ligand–receptor afﬁnity. in order to reduce the amount of
protein in the column and shorten the fac analysis time, a column length of 10 mm was chosen, and the inner diameter was
change from 2.0 to 0.8 mm. the frontal chromatographic curves
obtained for the columns of different inner diameter showed that
the fac analysis time was shortened by reducing the inner diameter,
and the small-inner-diameter column can increased sensitivity. the
small-inner-diameter column will be of beneﬁt to cmc–ms in the
future.
3.4. determination of kd and bt
the cmsp column of the rat aorta was characterized using
frontal chromatography in which serial concentrations of known
ligands were added to the mobile phase and passed through the
column. representative chromatographic curves produced by
frontal chromatography studies using bmy7378 are presented in
fig. 2. the relationship between the concentration of the ligand
and the retention volume was analyzed using eq. (1) to calculate
the kd of the ligand for the immobilized ␣1d -ar. this technique has
been applied previously to the study of numerous ligand–protein
interactions. using this approach, the calculated kd values
were 166.13 nm ( xxxd3000xxx ), 537.40 nm (bmy7378), 646.92 nm
( xxxd2914xxx ), 725.66 nm (5-methyl-urapidil), 910.56 nm
(oxymetazoline), and 1299.27 nm ( xxxd2601xxx ) as shown
in table 2. the average bt value was 10.26 ± 5.00 pmol bed−1 ,
and the calculated r2 values were 0.9628 ( xxxd3000xxx ), 0.9697
(bmy7378), 0.9712 ( xxxd2914xxx ), 0.9859 (5-methylurapidil),
0.9968 (oxymetazoline), and 0.9951( xxxd2601xxx ). the afﬁnity
rank order measured from the cmsp column of the rat aorta for
six ␣1 -ar ligands was  xxxd3000xxx  > bmy7378 >  xxxd2914xxx  > 5methylurapidil > oxymetazoline >  xxxd2601xxx .

4. discussion

3.5. correlation analysis between kd at the cmsp of the rat aorta
and published ˛1d pki values

the results of this study demonstrated that the cmsp of the
rat aorta was prepared successfully and determined correctly the
binding afﬁnity of six test ligands. the kd values determined by the
cmc system were not consistent with the binding afﬁnity constants
reported previously, especially the high binding afﬁnity ligands  xxxd3000xxx  and bmy7378. however, the afﬁnity rank order of the six
ligands was consistent with that reported previously, and the calculated kd values were positively correlated with the binding afﬁnity
constants reported in the literature. despite these drawbacks, these
results demonstrate that the cmc system is convenient and feasible
for determining the ligand–receptor kd values.
the kd values determined by the cmc system show that
selective ␣1 adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx , which had the
strongest afﬁnity, ranked ﬁrst, the highly selective ␣1d antagonist
bmy7378 ranked second, and the highly selective ␣1a antagonist 5-methylurapidil ranked fourth. in other words,  xxxd3000xxx  and
bmy7378 had strong receptor afﬁnity in the rat aorta, but 5methylurapidil had low afﬁnity. this supports the hypothesis that
a1d -ar is the predominant subtype in the rat aorta. it also demonstrates that cmc can be used to identify receptor subtypes in tissue,
like functional assay and rlba.
in previous studies, cmc has been applied to the study of
drug–receptor interactions and afﬁnity [4–8], which can be shown
by chromatographic parameters, such as capacity factors. however,
cmc cannot be used to assay kd . in the present study, our results
suggest that frontal analysis of cmc may be used for determination
of kd , and that cmc is an alternative reliable method to quantitatively study ligand–receptor interactions.
currently, receptor functional assay and rlba are the methods
that are most often used in studying ligand–receptor interactions. functional assay has high measurement errors, low accuracy,
and low sensitivity in quantitative analysis. rlba might result in
radioactive pollution and a need to separate free from bound ligands. moreover, rlba requires that ligand dissociation takes much
longer than the time required to perform the separation step. in
contrast to receptor functional assay and rlba, cmc has several
advantages. the receptors may be stably bound and may therefore
be reused over a long period of time. it may be possible to perform multiple experiments with hard-to-obtain receptors, using an
immobilized format.
furthermore, one of the most important advantages of cmc
is its utility for screening for active ingredients in plant extracts
and natural product-like libraries. cmsp has the dual effect of biological membrane activity and chromatographic separation, which
has been demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, surface
energy spectrometry, enzyme assay, and lc [1,2]. therefore, chromatographic separation and receptor-based assays for screening for
biologically active substances can be carried out simultaneously.
as a reliable tool, cmc has been used successfully to isolate and
analyze active leading compounds or effective components in chinese traditional medicine extracts, such as angelica sinensis [22],
herba epimedii [23], leontice robustum [24], and cladonia alpestris
[25].

full ranking scale data were analyzed using rank order correlation methods. the results are shown in fig. 3. the calculated
kd values were positively correlated with published pki a [19],
pki b [20] and pki c [21] values measured with rlba using stably

fig. 3. correlation between the calculated kd and published cloned a1d adrenoceptor pki values with an alpha level of 0.05 (two-tailed). correlation constants (r2 )
were calculated by linear regression analysis using graphpad prism 4.0: (a) kd vs
pki a (r2 = 0.9787, p = 0.0013); (b) kd vs pki b (r2 = 0.9621, p = 0.0032); (c) kd vs pki c
(r2 = 0.9828, p = 0.0010). literature values shown from a [19], b [20] and c [21].

5. conclusion
a method for measurement of drug-␣1d -ar afﬁnity by frontal
analysis of cmc was developed. cmsp columns that were prepared
by immobilizing rat aorta cell membranes on porous silica possessed stability, reproducibility and afﬁnity for ␣1d -ar agents. the
columns can be used for frontal afﬁnity chromatography. the different ␣1d -ar agents showed different afﬁnity on the columns, and
the relative binding afﬁnity (kd ) of ␣1d -ar agents showed a good
correlation with the afﬁnity of the same compounds for the cloned
␣1d -ar subtype obtained from rlba. in other words, the combination of cmc and frontal afﬁnity chromatography can be used
to determine kd . in the future, we will pursue to prepare the different cmsp columns and to determining different drug–receptor
afﬁnities, and screen active ingredients in plant extracts and natural
product-like libraries.
