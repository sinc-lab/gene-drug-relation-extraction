abstract
the transsulfuration pathway, which aids in regulating homocysteine concentration and mediates cysteine synthesis, may
be sensitive to  xxxd2716xxx -6 status because cystathionine b-synthase (cbs) and cystathionine g-lyase (cgl) require
pyridoxal 5#-phosphate (plp). to assess relations between  xxxd2716xxx -6 and transsulfuration, we evaluated the effects of
dietary pyridoxine (pn) on the hepatic concentration of relevant metabolites and in vitro activity of cbs and cgl. growing
rats were fed ain-93g– or ain-76a–based diets that ranged from adequate to deficient in  xxxd2716xxx -6 (2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, or
0 mg of pn/kg diet, n ¼ 5). this design allowed assessment of the effects of supplemental methionine (ain-76a) vs.
cysteine (ain-93g) in common research diets over a range of  xxxd2716xxx -6 levels. cbs activity, assayed in the presence or
absence of added s- xxxd3156xxx , was independent of diet type and pn level. cgl activity was independent of diet
type but proportional to dietary pn. rats fed deficient (0 and 0.1 mg pn/kg) diets exhibited only ;30% of the cgl activity
of those fed the 2 mg pn/kg diets. hepatic cystathionine increased from 20 to 30 nmol/g for the 1–2 mg pn/kg diets to
;85 nmol/g for the 0 mg pn/kg diet; however, cysteine was reduced only in b-6–deficient rats consuming the ain-93g
diet (means of 30–40 nmol/g for adequate to 11.6 nmol/g for 0 mg pn/kg ain-76a diet). in spite of these effects, hepatic
glutathione concentration increased in  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency. these results suggest that  xxxd2716xxx -6–dependent changes
in transsulfuration do not limit hepatic glutathione production. j. nutr. 136: 2141–2147, 2006.

introduction
epidemiologic studies showed that low  xxxd2716xxx -6 nutritional
status is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease
(1–6), venous thrombosis (7), stroke (6,8,9), and possibly colon
cancer (10), but the mechanism(s) responsible remain unclear.
unlike similar associations with low folate status, the enhanced
risk of vascular disease associated with low  xxxd2716xxx -6 status is
not necessarily dependent on elevated plasma homocysteine
(7,8). we reported recently that marginal  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency
reduces serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt)2 activity in
rat liver (11) and human lymphocytes (12), which suggests one
mechanism by which the regulation of 1-carbon units may be
altered. we also showed that marginal  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency
yields increased fasting glycine in rat liver and human plasma
(11,12), and an increase in plasma cystathionine and glutathione
concentration, but no change in the tracer-derived in vivo rate of

total and  xxxd2716xxx -6–dependent homocysteine remethylation
and no change in cysteine flux in humans under conditions of
minimal amino acid intake (12,13). the extent to which vitamin
b-6 deficiency affects 1-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration
flux under conditions of greater amino acid intake (e.g., postprandial conditions) is unclear and under investigation.
the transsulfuration pathway, which contributes to homocysteine regulation and provides cysteine synthesis, consists of
sequential reactions catalyzed by cystathionine-b-synthase (cbs)
and cystathionine-g-lyase (cgl) (14). cbs catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine
in a reaction that is subject to positive allosteric regulation by
s- xxxd3156xxx  (sam), whereas cgl catalyzes the cleavage
of cystathionine to yield a-ketobutyrate, ammonia, and cysteine.
because both cbs and cgl require pyridoxal 5#-phosphate (plp) as
a coenzyme (15–18), inadequate  xxxd2716xxx -6 status might lead to
impaired regulation of cellular homocysteine concentration and
reduced synthesis of cysteine. in addition, a reduction in cellular
sam concentration caused by  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency (19) could
cause reduced in vivo activity of cbs and, hence, reduced flux
through the transsulfuration pathway.
previous studies showed effects of  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency on
aspects of the transsulfuration process (15,20–26). however,
such studies involved mainly comparisons of pronounced

animals and diets. we report here the results of further analyses of
tissue fractions collected in a previous study of weanling male rats
(hsd:sprague-dawley; harlan laboratories) weighing ;50 g conducted
to investigate the effects of relations between diet composition and
 xxxd2716xxx -6 content on intestinal b-glucosidases (28) and hepatic shmt
activities (11). rats were housed in hanging wire-mesh stainless steel
cages and maintained at a constant temperature with a 12-h light:dark
cycle. all procedures for animal care and treatment were approved by the
university of florida institutional animal care and use committee.
as described previously (28), the study used 2 basal rodent diet
formulations (ain-76a and ain-93g) modified only with respect to
 xxxd2716xxx -6 content (dyets). the ain-76a diet contains by weight 20%
casein and 0.30% dl-methionine (29), whereas the ain-93g diet
contains 20% casein and 0.30% l-cysteine (30). rats (n ¼ 50) were
divided into 10 groups, n ¼ 5, to receive ain-76a or ain-93g containing
2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, or 0 mg/kg pn added as pn-hcl. food intake and rat
weight were monitored daily, and the rats had free access to food and
water. starting on the evening of d 35, food was withheld for ;12 h; then
the rats were anesthetized using halothane (alocarbon laboratories)
inhalation and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture the following morning. the livers were removed, and cooled on ice.
in preparation for enzyme activity assays, a portion of each liver was
homogenized (polytron, brinkmann instruments) in 10 volumes of icecold 0.01 mol/l potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) with 0.1 mol/l
 xxxd2988xxx  and 0.5 mmol/l edta (26) containing a protease
inhibitor cocktail (sigma p8340) added just before use. after centrifugation at 200,000 3 g for 30 min at 4c, portions of the supernatant
were maintained at 280c until analyzed. the remainder of each liver
was maintained at 280c until use in chemical analyses. all laboratory
procedures were performed under gold fluorescent light to minimize the
photochemical degradation of  xxxd2716xxx -6. the enzymatic analyses and
quantitative analyses of amino acids and aminothiols were conducted
concurrently with those regarding shmt reported previously (11).

cystathionine concentrations were measured ;1 y later, after validation
of the assay.
analytical methods. plp was measured using reverse-phase fluorometric hplc of the semicarbazone derivative according to the method of
ubbink et al. (31) with minor modifications. protein concentration was
determined using the markwell protein assay (32) with bovine serum
albumin as the standard protein.
the concentration of hepatic total cysteine, homocysteine, and
glutathione (free and disulfide forms) was determined by fluorometric
hplc (33). cystathionine in liver was determined as the heptafluorobutyryl n-propyl ester derivative using gc-ms in negative chemical
ionization mode with selected-ion monitoring for quantification of
endogenous cystathionine using [2h4]cystathionine as an internal standard (13).
cystathionine b-synthase (cbs) activity. assays of cbs activity were
conducted under conditions described by kraus (34). portions of each
liver extract were preincubated for 20 min at 37c in the presence of 2
mmol/l dl-propargylglycine (ppg), an inhibitor of cgl activity (35),
which yielded approximately double the apparent cbs activity. the
assays were initiated by adding 10 ml of the ppg-treated liver extract to
a reaction mixture (100 ml total volume) providing 100 mmol/l trishcl at ph 8.6, 10 mmol/l l-serine, and 30 mmol/l dl-homocysteine.
incubations were conducted for 10 min at 37c and were terminated by
a 3-min incubation in a boiling water bath. each liver extract was
assayed both with and without the inclusion of 0.5 mmol/l of sam in
the reaction mixture. the product, cystathionine, was quantified by hplc
(36). preliminary experiments verified that product formation was
linearly related to incubation time and enzyme concentration under these
conditions. activity was expressed as micromoles of cystathionine produced per minute per milligram of protein.
cystathionine g-lyase (cgl) activity. cgl activity was determined by
a modification of the method of heinonen (37). reaction mixtures were
composed of 100 mmol/l tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane (ph 8.4)
and 8 mmol/l l-cystathionine in a total volume of 50 ml. each liver
extract was assayed both with no added plp and with 0.05 mmol/l plp
added (21). the activity detected in the presence of added plp indicated
the activity of total cgl (i.e., apo-cgl 1 holo-cgl), and the ratio of
activities with and without added plp (apo-cgl 1 holo-cgl)/(holocgl) indicated the fraction of total cgl that was in the apo-enzyme
form (21). samples assayed without exogenous plp represented basal
activity. reactions were started by the addition of 5 ml of liver extract,
incubated at 37c for 10 min, and then stopped by incubation in a
boiling water bath for 3 min. cysteine concentrations in the resulting
supernatants were measured by hplc (33). activities were expressed as
micromoles of cysteine produced per milligram of protein per minute.
product formation was linear with incubation time and enzyme concentration. the concentration of cystathionine was varied from 0 to
8 mmol/l in a preliminary study conducted to evaluate the km of rat
liver cgl for cystathionine under these conditions.
statistical analysis. the data were evaluated using 2-way anova,
with diet type (ain-76a or ain-93g) and pn concentration as main
factors, with multiple comparisons using the holm-sidak method and
sigma stat 3.0 software (spss). data were transformed by log10
conversion as necessary to improve normality, equalize variance, or
both. the results are reported as least-square means and pooled sem.
the p-values designating the significance of differences among treatments reported in the tables are derived from 2-way anova. for the
statistical analyses for cbs and cgl (table 2), the data are presented
as the least-square mean for each level of dietary pn because the main
effect of diet type and the diet 3 pn interaction were not significant
in the 2-way anova. relations between selected variables, including
michaelis-menten analysis for the determination of the cystathionine
km, were evaluated by regression analysis using microsoft excel or
saam ii. differences with p , 0.05 were considered to be significant.

 xxxd2716xxx -6–deficient vs. adequate or supplemented states and
provided little information about states of marginal-to-moderate
deficiency that are particularly relevant to human nutrition (27).
although  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency in rats was reported to yield a
significant reduction in hepatic cbs activity (15), others found
little reduction in cbs activity in perhaps less severe deficiency
states (20,24). sturman et al. (20) compared the activity of cgl
and cbs in rats administered a high pyridoxine (pn) diet (50 mg
pn/kg diet) with that of deficient rats administered no dietary
pn. the deficient diet reduced liver cbs activity, but caused a
much greater reduction in cgl activity. sato et al. (21) confirmed
these findings and showed that turnover of cgl increases in
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency due to increased proteolytic turnover of
apo-cgl.
the study reported here was conducted to assess the
dependence of the hepatic activities of cbs and cgl and the
in vivo concentration of the products cystathionine, cysteine,
and glutathione on  xxxd2716xxx -6 nutritional status ranging from
adequacy through deficiency. by evaluating basal diets supplemented with either methionine or cysteine (ain-76a vs. ain93g, respectively), this study yielded initial information about
the effect of dietary methionine and cysteine intakes on the
functional effect of  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency on transsulfuration.
in addition, we tested the hypothesis that  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency
would yield lower concentrations of hepatic glutathione because
of lower production of its precursor cysteine.

table 2

effects of dietary pyridoxine on nutritional status. liver
plp concentration increased in proportion to dietary pn
concentration (p , 0.001), which confirms that the dietary
treatment affected  xxxd2716xxx -6 status and coenzyme concentration at the tissue level (table 1). plasma plp and weight gain in
this study, which also reflect  xxxd2716xxx -6 nutritional status, were
reported previously in other papers derived from this study
(11,28). the appearance of dermatological abnormalities
(acrodynia) in the rats consuming the 0 mg pn/kg diets confirmed the existence of overt  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency associated
with that dietary level (28).

hepatic cystathionine g-lyase activity. basal and plp-stimulated cgl activity were significantly and positively related to
dietary pn concentration (p , 0.001 without and with plp) but
were not affected by diet type (table 2). plp-stimulated cgl
activity increased in proportion to dietary pn. a plp stimulation index calculated as the ratio of plp-stimulated cgl
activity:basal cgl activity ranged from 1.37 for 2 mg pn/kg
to 2.09 for 0 mg pn/kg diet (effect of dietary pn significant, p ,
0.001). however, the relation between plp stimulation and
dietary pn content was distinctly nonlinear, with only the 2 most
deficient diets yielding significantly greater plp stimulation than
the 3 higher pn diets. thus, the proportion of cgl protein in
apo-enzyme form, which is reflected by the degree of stimulation, was not a linear function of dietary pn concentration.

hepatic cystathionine b-synthase activity. neither diet type
(ain-76a or ain-93g) nor dietary pn concentration affected
liver cbs activity either with or without the addition of sam for
allosteric activation (table 2). in this analysis, exogenous sam
increased cbs activity .2-fold, and there was no significant
effect of diet type or dietary pn concentration (table 2). in
addition, there was no relation between basal or sam-stimulated cbs activity and liver plp concentration (data not shown).
in view of the large dilution in tissue preparation and cbs assay,
endogenous sam would have little effect on this in vitro
allosteric stimulation.

(p ¼ 0.016); their interaction approached significance (p ¼
0.052). in contrast to expectation, the concentration of homocysteine declined with declining dietary pn. concentrations of
liver homocysteine were lower during  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency in
the ain-76a diet than in comparable  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency
with the ain-93g diet (table 3).
diet type did not affect the hepatic cystathionine concentration, but cystathionine increased markedly as dietary pn
declined (p , 0.001). hepatic cystathionine concentrations in
livers of rats fed 0 mg pn/kg diets were ;4 times greater than
those of rats fed the more adequate diets in the 1–2 mg pn/kg
range (table 3). the relation between hepatic cgl activity and
cystathionine concentration could be fit to 2 linear regression
lines that intersected at a cgl activity of ;0.65 nmol 3 (mg
protein 3 min)21, which demonstrated that variation in gcl
activity over the range of ;0.7–1.6 nmol 3 (mg protein 3 min)21
provided sufficient enzymatic activity such that there was little
or no increase in cystathionine. reduction in cgl activity below
;0.7 nmol 3 (mg protein 3 min)21 yielded increased liver
cystathionine concentration (fig. 1). a plot of liver plp vs.
cystathionine concentration yielded a similar relation (data not
shown).

liver cysteine was influenced significantly by diet type (p ¼
0.026) and dietary pn concentration (p , 0.001), with a
significant interaction between diet type and pn concentration
(p ¼ 0.016). hepatic cysteine declined during  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency most notably in rats fed the methionine-supplemented
ain-76a diet. for example, hepatic cysteine was 41.4 and
11.6 nmol/g in rats fed ain-76a diets containing 2.0 and 0 mg
pn/kg.
liver glutathione concentration was not affected by diet type
but in contrast with its precursor, cysteine, increased significantly with decreasing dietary pn (p ¼ 0.009; table 3). this
overall significant inverse relation between liver glutathione
concentration and dietary pn was largely attributable to the
response of groups fed the ain-93g diet.

discussion
this paper extends our investigations of the effects of inadequate
 xxxd2716xxx -6 nutritional status on 1-carbon metabolism (11–
13,24,38) by reporting information concerning the dependence
of hepatic transsulfuration on dietary  xxxd2716xxx -6 concentration
and  xxxd2716xxx -6 status. the experimental design also permitted
an evaluation of the effects of supplemental dietary methionine
vs. cysteine in 2 common research diets that would be considered
adequate in protein and sulfur amino acid content (30). the
ain-76a formulation provided 0.30 g added dl-methionine,
0.52 g  xxxd2595xxx  from casein, 0.82 g total methionine, and
0.08 g total l-cysteine from casein/100 g of diet. in contrast, the
ain-93g provided 0.52 g  xxxd2595xxx  from casein, 0.30 g
added l-cysteine, 0.08 g l-cysteine from casein, and 0.38 g total
l-cysteine/100 g diet. the results of this study illustrate how the
selection of the basal diet formulation can influence conclusions
in studies involving the metabolism of sulfur amino acids and
related nutritional variables.
all of the concentrations of dietary pn used (#2 mg pn/kg
diet) were less than the nrc recommendation of 7 mg pn/kg
diet (39); however, many previous studies showed that vitamin
b-6 adequacy occurs in growing rats consuming between 1 and

of this study was to evaluate the response in the intermediate
range of  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency, which is most relevant to human
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency. the extent to which liver plp declined in

18); thus, the greater reduction of cgl cannot be explained
simply on the basis of coenzyme affinity. the greater sensitivity
of cgl than cbs to  xxxd2716xxx -6 depletion may reflect differences in the rate of turnover of these proteins.
the mechanisms by which  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency affects
glutathione concentration remain unclear. under conditions in
which the supply of cysteine, whether from dietary sources or
synthesis, limits glutathione synthesis, one would predict lower
hepatic glutathione in  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency. however, if
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency is associated with an inflammatory state
(44,45) or oxidative stress (45–47) that may trigger enhanced
glutathione synthesis, then hepatic glutathione concentration
would parallel the extent of deficiency as seen here. in this study,
there was a highly significant (p ¼ 0.009) inverse effect of
dietary pn concentration on glutathione concentration. even
the group fed 0 mg pn/kg of the ain-76a diet, which exhibited
a large reduction in hepatic cysteine, maintained hepatic
glutathione, which is contrary to our initial hypothesis that
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency would depress glutathione production.
various forms of oxidative stress were shown to activate cbs
(48–50). such an effect in  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency may have
contributed to the elevated cystathionine and glutathione
observed in this study, but cysteine concentrations do not
support such an interpretation. it also is noteworthy that, in the
absence of other pathological conditions, marginal  xxxd2716xxx -6
deficiency in humans does not cause an increase in c-reactive
protein, a common marker of systemic inflammation (13).
this study involved only the measurement of steady-state
concentrations of various substrates and metabolites and cannot
predict in vivo rates of reactions. our recent study of marginal
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency in humans showed a large increase in the
cystathionine pool but no change in flux of the cysteine pool
(13). because the method did not allow measurement of the flux
through the cgl reaction, overall transsulfuration flux could
not be determined with that tracer protocol. thus, the net effect
of  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency on the transsulfuration pathway in
vivo remains unclear. under the in vitro conditions of the cgl
assay, we observed a km for cystathionine of 2.1 6 0.2 mmol/l,
which is consistent with the reported km of 3 mmol/l for
purified cgl (51). if hepatic cgl behaved similarly in vivo,
then the reaction would be only half-saturated at a liver
cystathionine concentration of ;2.1 mmol/g. in view of the
fact that liver cystathionine concentrations ranged from ;20–90
nmol/g, one would conclude that the in vivo cgl reaction rate
would be almost first order with respect to cystathionine
concentration. thus, elevated hepatic cystathionine concentration would yield a higher rate of the cgl reaction, which would
tend to offset losses of cgl activity due to  xxxd2716xxx -6
deficiency. this reasoning may explain our observation that
hepatic cysteine is maintained under most conditions of vitamin
b-6 deficiency. it also may explain why cysteine flux was unchanged in  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency in our recent tracer study in
humans (13). the mechanism and implications of the increases in
liver glutathione (in this study) and plasma glutathione in humans
(13) in proportion to  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency are under investigation. the effects of  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency on hepatic glutathione reported in previous rodent studies are inconsistent (25,47).
this study extends our understanding of the metabolic
changes associated with intermediate levels of  xxxd2716xxx -6
deficiency. we recently reported in an accompanying paper
regarding this study that cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of
hepatic shmt undergo substantial reductions in activity (11)
that are similar to those shown here for cgl over this range of
 xxxd2716xxx -6 status, with comparable reductions also seen in
 xxxd2716xxx -6 and transsulfuration

with previous studies (e.g., 24,40) and reflects the existence of
slow turnover pools of  xxxd2716xxx -6.
the potential suppression of transsulfuration during vitamin
b-6 deficiency has long been recognized, but the physiological
implications have not been fully determined. the methionine
load test constitutes an evaluation of the metabolic capacity of
the transsulfuration pathway to handle the load of substrate
(homocysteine) derived from the large dose of methionine. the
capacity to metabolize this methionine load is suppressed as a
function of  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency (e.g., 22,41). in spite of the
diagnostic usefulness of the methionine load test, previous
research has not clarified fully whether such changes in
transsulfuration capacity predict changes in actual metabolic
flux through the pathway during mild  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency.
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency can cause elevated homocysteine
concentration in tissue and plasma (e.g., 24,41,42), although
this effect is less pronounced that that of folate deficiency (41).
in this study, liver homocysteine exhibited an unexpected decline
with decreasing  xxxd2716xxx -6 status. this result is inconsistent
with our previous findings using a similar dietary protocol (24)
and may be a function of food intake and, thus, methionine
intake, that was not controlled for in this study. in spite of the
12-h period of food withdrawal before the rats were killed, it is
likely that methionine and homocysteine concentrations were
affected by short-term consumption. in addition, the data for
liver homocysteine in this study are subject to some uncertainty
due to potential action of sah hydrolase during tissue
fractionation (43). the reductive treatment used in this homocysteine assay (33) presumably yields accurate measurement of
total homocysteine and accurately reflects relative differences
among dietary groups.
several studies showed that the concentration of the transsulfuration intermediate, cystathionine, in the plasma of humans
(13,22) and rats (23) is particularly sensitive to inadequate
 xxxd2716xxx -6 status. the present study provides, to our knowledge,
the first study of the dose-response relation of  xxxd2716xxx -6 with
hepatic cbs and cgl activities and metabolite concentrations.
this study complements that of stabler et al. (23) who reported
the effects of graded levels of dietary pn on plasma concentrations of cystathionine and other components of 1-carbon metabolism in rats. taken together, these studies clearly show that
plasma and liver cystathionine concentration is a very sensitive
biomarker of  xxxd2716xxx -6 insufficiency ranging from slightly
suboptimal to frankly deficient levels of  xxxd2716xxx -6 status. in
addition, our data strongly suggest that the sensitivity of hepatic
cystathionine concentration to  xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency is related
primarily to the resulting depletion of the holo-enzyme form of
hepatic cgl coupled with the previously shown (21) reduction in
the total cgl pool due to the faster turnover of apo-gcl.
although an influence of  xxxd2716xxx -6 status on in vivo
activity of hepatic cbs is plausible, as reported by finkelstein
and chalmers (15), our results suggest that hepatic cbs activity
was largely independent of both dietary pn concentration and
hepatic plp concentration. this lack of influence of  xxxd2716xxx -6
status on cbs activity was consistent with observations by
sturman et al. (20). under the conditions of this study, vitamin
b-6 deficiency may have affected the extent to which cbs
undergoes activation by sam (19), which may not have been
detected under the conditions of cbs assays in this study. our
previous data suggest that the primary effect of  xxxd2716xxx -6
deficiency on transsulfuration is on the cgl reaction, which was
impaired even under conditions in which hepatic sam was only
slightly reduced (24). the affinity constants for binding plp by
cbs are of a magnitude similar to that reported for cgl (16–

human lymphocyte shmt (12) in marginal  xxxd2716xxx -6
deficiency. thus, the related processes of 1-carbon metabolism
and transsulfuration potentially can be impaired in marginal
 xxxd2716xxx -6 deficiency, particularly under conditions of dietary
or metabolic increases in substrate loads or genetic alterations in
enzyme activities. our recent studies of marginal  xxxd2716xxx -6
deficiency in humans showed elevated plasma glycine (12) and
cystathionine (13) at levels of  xxxd2716xxx -6 status considered
adequate as defined in calculating the current rda value (27), as
reflected by plasma plp $20 nmol/l. thus, the relations among
 xxxd2716xxx -6–dependent metabolic processes, human health, and
dietary recommendations require further clarification.
