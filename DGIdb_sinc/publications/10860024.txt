effects of calcium channel blockers on cloned cardiac k+ channels ikr and iks.  cloned herg and  xxxg1268xxx -isk k+ channels have been expressed in mammalian cells and assayed as a target for calcium channel blockers. these channels generate the rapid and slow components of the cardiac delayed rectifier k+ current, and mutations can affect them that lead to long qt syndromes. herg is blocked by  xxxd318xxx  (ec50 = 0.55 microm), verapamil (ec50 = 0.83 microm) and  xxxd2638xxx  (ec50 = 1.43 microm), whereas  xxxd2737xxx  and diltiazem have negligible effects. steady-state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more negative values in the presence of the blockers. similarly,  xxxg1268xxx -isk is inhibited by  xxxd318xxx  (ec50 = 10.0 microm) and  xxxd2638xxx  (ec50 = 11.8 microm), whilst being insensitive to  xxxd2737xxx , diltiazem or verapamil. this work may help to understand the mechanisms of action of verapamil in certain ventricular tachycardias as well as some of the deleterious adverse cardiac events associated with  xxxd318xxx  and  xxxd2638xxx .
