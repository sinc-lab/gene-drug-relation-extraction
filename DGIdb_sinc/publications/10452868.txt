introduction
laparotomy involving manipulation of the small intestine causes injury, initiating an inflammatory cascade in the small bowel wall, which generates eicosanoids and proinflammatory cytokines. we have
shown that ketorolac and  xxxd3163xxx , nonselective cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors, ameliorate postoperative small bowel ileus in a rodent model. others have
shown that interleukin-1 receptor antagonism improves postoperative gastric emptying. we examined
whether inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines,
 xxxg2296xxx  a ( xxxg2296xxx ) and interleukin-1
(il-1), or selective blockade of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox2), the cox isoform induced during inflammation,
would accelerate postoperative small bowel transit in
our model. duodenostomy tubes were inserted into
male sprague–dawley rats. one week later, animals
were randomized to receive tnf-binding protein
(tnf-bp),  xxxd2806xxx  ( xxxg1172xxx ), or saline
(ns) prior to standardized laparotomy. additional rats
were gavaged preoperatively with a selective cox-2
inhibitor (ns-398) or ns. small intestinal transit was
measured as the geometric center (gc) of distribution
of 51cro 4 at 30 min, 3 h, or 6 h (n 5 5–9 rats/group)
following laparotomy. selective inhibition of cox-2
significantly increased postoperative small bowel
transit compared to controls (gc 2.9 6 0.3 vs 2.2 6 0.1
at 30 min, gc 2.9 6 0.3 vs 2.5 6 0.2 at 3 h, and gc 3.3 6
0.3 vs 2.8 6 0.2 at 6 h, p < 0.05). in contrast, neither
tnf-bp nor  xxxg1172xxx  altered postoperative small intestinal transit in this model. use of selective cox-2 inhibitors may accelerate recovery of postoperative bowel
dysmotility without the undesirable effects (e.g., gastrointestinal irritation and anti-platelet effect) of nonselective cox inhibitors. © 1999 academic press
key words: cox-2;  xxxg2296xxx ;  xxxg1172xxx ; ileus; motility.

for over a century it has been recognized that abdominal surgery inhibits bowel motility [1]. this inhibition has been referred to as physiologic [2] or functional [3] and usually resolves spontaneously within 4
to 5 days. ileus has generally not been a concern unless
prolonged, when it is termed paralytic ileus [4]. however, even routine, uncomplicated postoperative ileus
prolongs patient discomfort, lengthens hospitalization,
and increases medical costs [5].
despite nearly a hundred years of study, no effective
therapy has been developed to specifically prevent or
shorten postoperative ileus, and treatment remains
primarily supportive [6]. functional ileus is thought to
occur via excitation of afferent sensory neurons, with
resulting reflex activation of sympathetic efferent
pathways via the prevertebral ganglia and central nervous system [6]. the majority of previous clinical and
experimental approaches have been designed to intervene with efferent pathways using sympatholytic or
cholemimetic agents to counteract increased sympathetic tone [6]. the beneficial effect from these drugs,
however, has largely been overshadowed by their systemic side effects [6]. an alternative approach has been
the use of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide,
erythromycin, and  xxxd1708xxx  to stimulate postoperative
gastrointestinal motility. trials using these agents,
however, have shown them to be ineffective [7–9].
few studies have explored the afferent pathways of
postoperative ileus. tissue trauma, as occurs with abdominal surgery, initiates an inflammatory cascade in
the small bowel wall, generating eicosanoids such as
prostacyclin (pgi 2 ) [10] and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis
factor a ( xxxg2296xxx ) [11–13]. eicosanoids are liberated
from  xxxd208xxx  (aa) by the catalytic effects of

josephs et al.: role of cox-2 in postoperative ileus

cyclooxygenase (cox). cox exists as two isoforms,
cox-1 and cox-2. both metabolize aa to form the
prostaglandins and thromboxanes; however, cox-1 is
a constitutively expressed gene, whereas expression of
cox-2 is induced by a variety of cytokines, hormones,
and growth factors, including the inflammatory mediators il-1 and  xxxg2296xxx  [14 –16]. we have demonstrated
that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ketorolac and  xxxd3163xxx , nonselective cox inhibitors, improve small bowel transit and myoelectric activity in a
rodent model of postoperative ileus [17, 18]. however,
a problem with using these agents clinically is their
anti-platelet effect, which could increase postoperative
bleeding, as well as their gastric irritant effect, even
when administered parenterally. others have shown
that il-1 receptor antagonism improves postoperative
gastric emptying [19]. the current study examined
whether inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1, or cox-2, the cox
isoform induced during inflammatory states, accelerates postoperative small bowel transit in a rodent
model of postoperative ileus.
methods
animals. male sprague–dawley rats (harlan sprague–dawley,
inc., indianapolis, in) weighing 275–300 g were acclimated to the
facility for 7–10 days. animals were maintained under conditions of
controlled temperature and illumination and were provided with
chow and water ad libitum. prior to all surgical procedures, they
were deprived of food for 18 –20 h. this study protocol was approved
by both the university of florida college of medicine institutional
animal care and use committee and the gainesville veteran’s
administration animal care and use committee.
small intestinal transit studies. under ketamine anesthesia (75
mg/kg body weight [bw]) with  xxxd60xxx  (1 mg/kg bw), silastic
catheters were inserted into the duodenum via a midline laparotomy,
tunneled through the lateral abdominal wall, and exteriorized between the scapulae dorsally. the catheters were temporarily occluded and secured into place for future use. after recovery, animals
were returned to their cages and feeding was resumed.
one week following placement of the duodenostomy tubes, rats
were randomized into one of three treatment groups. group i animals received  xxxg2296xxx -binding protein (tnf-bp, 5
mg/kg bw intraperitoneally [ip]; amgen, inc., boulder, co) or physiologic saline (ns) 30 min prior to a standardized laparotomy. group
ii rats were administered  xxxd172xxx  ( xxxg1172xxx ,
100 mg/kg bw ip; amgen, inc.) or ns 30 min before laparotomy.
both tnf-bp and  xxxg1172xxx  have been shown to neutralize the physiologic effects of tnf and il-1, respectively, in rodent models of inflammation [20, 21]. group iii animals were gavaged with ns-398 (1
mg/kg bw; cayman chemical co., ann arbor, mi), a selective cox-2
inhibitor, or ns 1 h prior to laparotomy. the standardized laparotomy consisted of a midline incision under ketamine anesthesia, with
manipulation of the stomach, small bowel, and colon for 1 min each,
followed by small bowel evisceration for 5 min, and abdominal closure.
thirty minutes, 3 h, or 6 h following laparotomy (n 5 5–9 rats/time
point), the animals were administered an enteral bolus of 0.2 ml
na 51cro 4 (amersham bioscience, boston, ma) in ns via the duodenostomy catheter. na 51cro 4 is not absorbed by the small intestine
and has been validated as a marker of intestinal propulsion [15, 16,
22]. animals were sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg
bw ip) 25 min following na 51cro 4 administration. the small intes-

tine was ligated proximal to the duodenostomy tubes and at the

and placed into scintillation vials. the radioactivity in each segment
was determined with a beckman gamma 5500 (beckman instruments, irvine, ca) gamma counter and expressed as the percentage

statistical analysis. all data are expressed as means 6 sem.
differences in small bowel transit were compared using two-way
analysis of variance and student–newman–keuls post hoc analysis.
a 95% confidence interval (p , 0.05) was used to determine statistical significance.

results

there was no operative mortality from either duodenostomy tube insertion or standardized laparotomy.
preoperative administration of the cytokine inhibitors
tnf-bp and  xxxg1172xxx  had no effect on small intestinal
transit following laparotomy (figs. 1 and 2). in contrast, selective inhibition of cox-2 with ns-398 resulted in significantly increased small bowel transit
after laparotomy compared to control animals (fig. 3,
p , 0.05). furthermore, this effect was not timedependent, as the gc of radiolabel distribution was
improved in the ns-398 groups compared to controls at
all time points evaluated.

testinal contents following abdominal surgery [6, 25],
remains a major cause of morbidity in surgical patients. this disorder is directly responsible for substantial patient discomfort and prolonged hospital stays
due to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. in addition, current modalities of treatment, which remain
supportive and include nasogastric tubes and intravenous catheters, add to this discomfort and further increase medical costs. the trend toward increased use of
laparoscopy is thought to have had an impact on postoperative length of stay. however, despite the general
impression that laparoscopic approaches are not associated with ileus, currently there is no evidence that
laparoscopic bowel resection is associated with a shortened period of ileus compared to open surgery [26, 27].
furthermore, at present, it does not appear that all
abdominal operations will be amenable to a laparoscopic approach. despite oschner’s description in 1930
of the treatment of ileus with medication [28], nearly
70 years later, no definitive therapies are available for
this incapacitating condition. thus, postoperative ileus
will likely remain a common reason for hospitalization
for the foreseeable future.
previous studies from our laboratory have shown
that nonselective cox inhibitors increase small bowel
transit in a rodent model of postoperative ileus [18, 19].
the mechanism of action of these drugs in stimulating
postoperative small bowel motility is unknown, but is
likely related to their inhibitory effect on eicosanoid
synthesis. pgi 2 delays transit and inhibits intestinal
contractions [29, 30], similar to the motility changes
which occur following surgery. this inhibitory effect is
presumably mediated by pgi 2’s direct effect on smooth
muscle cells, as well as by stimulation of visceral afferent sensory nerves [31]. the importance of visceral
sensory nerves in the development of postoperative
ileus has previously been demonstrated by holzer et al.

[32]. their group showed that selective ablation of afferent sensory neurons from the gut following neonatal
administration of the selective sensory neurotoxin,
capsaicin, subsequently led to markedly improved
postoperative small bowel transit [32]. more recently,
we confirmed that local application of capsaicin to the
celiac/sma ganglion complex, selectively destroying
sensory afferent fibers originating from the foregut,
also improved postoperative small bowel transit [33].
here we have shown that selective inhibition of
cox-2 ameliorates postoperative ileus in a rat model.
this is likely due to the inhibition of pgi 2 synthesis,
although the production of other prostanoids, such as
pge 2, is inhibited with ns-398 as well. eicosanoids, in
particular pgi 2 and pge 2, exert a hyperalgesic effect
by decreasing the threshold of afferent nerve fibers to
painful stimuli by noxious agents, including histamine
and bradykinin [34]. stimulation of these pain fibers
diminishes small intestinal motility through adrenergic reflex pathways [35]. interruption of the afferent
and efferent limbs of this pathway by capsaicin and
6-hydroxydopamine or splanchnicectomy ameliorates
postoperative ileus [32, 35, 36]. this effect may be
attenuated by the inhibition of prostanoid synthesis
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [31, 37] or,
as we have demonstrated, with a selective cox-2 inhibitor.
we were intrigued to find significant improvement of
ileus at 30 min postoperatively, since our selective
cox-2 inhibitor, ns-398 should inhibit only the inducible form of cox. synthesis of mrna for cox-2 should
take a minimum of 2 h, and thus we expected to see
minimal improvement in early postoperative small
bowel transit. this improvement in early postoperative
transit can be explained by the fact that cox-2 mrna
is expressed basally in human and, presumably, rat

josephs et al.: role of cox-2 in postoperative ileus

small intestine [38]. blockade of this fraction of cox
appears to reduce production of prostanoids enough to
ameliorate postoperative ileus. constitutively expressed cox-1-induced prostaglandin synthesis would
be uninhibited by ns-398. this may explain why, in a
previous study, pretreatment with the nonselective
cox inhibitor ketorolac returned transit at 30 min
postoperatively to control, nonoperated values [18],
while in the present study the effect of the selective
cox-2 inhibitor ns-398 was more modest. the advantage of the latter, however, is that its beneficial effect
on postoperative ileus should not be accompanied by
the undesirable effects of nonselective cox inhibition,
such as an anti-platelet effect and a deleterious effect
on the gastric mucosa.
we were surprised that neither the tnf-bp nor the
 xxxg1172xxx  improved postoperative small bowel transit in
our model. exogenous il-1 and tnf have been shown
to induce gastroparesis in rodents in a dose-dependent
fashion [39, 40], and coimbra and plourde demonstrated that  xxxg1172xxx  improved postoperative gastric
emptying [19]. the reason for the lack of effect of the
 xxxg1172xxx  on postoperative small bowel ileus in the
present study is unknown. coimbra and plourde demonstrated that il-1 acted via the release of calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp). our laboratory previously demonstrated that a cgrp receptor antagonist
did not improve postoperative small bowel transit [33],
despite the study by plourde et al. [41] that documented improvement in postoperative gastric emptying with a cgrp receptor antagonist. we attribute this
disparity to the differing innervation of the stomach
and small bowel [33].
in summary, this study demonstrates that preoperative administration of a selective cox-2 inhibitor significantly improves postoperative ileus. although the
mechanism of this effect is unknown, it likely involves
inhibition of production of pgi 2 and pge 2, with prevention of their direct inhibitory effect on intestinal
smooth muscle, as well as reduction of visceral afferent
nerve fiber stimulation and secondary activation of
sympathetic efferent fibers. more insight into the
mechanism of postoperative ileus is necessary to develop new therapeutic approaches to change management from a supportive role to a curative or preventative one.
