effects of diphenhydramine and  xxxd2082xxx  on lipid peroxidation and activities of antioxidant enzymes in different rat tissues.  the potential antioxidant activity of diphenhydramine (histamine h1-receptor antagonist) and  xxxd2082xxx  (histamine  xxxg1079xxx  antagonist) was studied. diphenhydramine inhibited the spontaneous, fe(ii)-induced and fe(ii)/ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation, while  xxxd2082xxx  showed a biphasic concentration-dependent effect on spontaneous lipid peroxidation (a stimulation by 1 mm and an inhibition by 5 mm) and increased fe(ii)-induced- and inhibited fe(ii)/ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation in the rat liver and brain. both drugs decreased *oh-provoked deoxyribose degradation in fenton-type systems and inhibited o2- -provoked reduction of nitro-blue tetrazolium and ferrycytochrome c, but  xxxd2082xxx  effect was stronger than that of diphenhydramine. the significant  xxxd2082xxx -induced inhibition of nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction might be underlain by the stimulation of superoxide dismutase activity.  xxxd2082xxx  and diphenhydramine did not alter the catalase activity in all tissue preparations, except for its concentration of 5 mm (a complete inhibition). the present results suggest a beneficial effect of histamine h1 and h2-blockers, especially  xxxd2082xxx , as antioxidants and/or metal chelators, which might be an additional explanation of their therapeutic action.
