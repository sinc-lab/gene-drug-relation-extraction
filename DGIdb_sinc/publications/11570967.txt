studies in mice have shown that  xxxg1162xxx  ( xxxg1162xxx )
signalling is required for female fertility. in the absence
of  xxxg1162xxx , decidualization is markedly retarded and
implantation fails.  xxxg1162xxx  acts via a heterodimeric receptor
composed of a ligand-specific receptor alpha chain (il-11ralpha)
and the signalling moiety gp130. this study reports the
cloning of genes encoding rat  xxxg1162xxx  and il-11ralpha. rnase
protection was used to demonstrate that expression of  xxxg1162xxx  is upregulated in the rat uterus at the initiation of
implantation at 5.5 days after mating. expression of the

genes encoding the two receptor components,  xxxg1163xxx  and
gp130, did not change throughout the peri-implantation
period. in situ hybridization studies revealed that, as in
mice, expression of  xxxg1162xxx  was high in the primary decidual
zone at the time of the attachment reaction, whereas
 xxxg1163xxx  was expressed throughout primary and secondary
decidua. conservation of the temporal and spatial
expression of  xxxg1162xxx  and il-11ralpha in the uterus of the mouse
and rat during the peri-implantation period will facilitate
future studies investigating the role of  xxxg1162xxx  in fertility.

introduction

receptor is restricted to lymphoid tissues and testis (bilinski
et al., 1996; robb et al., 1996, 1997).
mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding il-11ralpha
revealed a key role for  xxxg1162xxx  in the fertility of female mice. in
il-11ralpha null female mice, the uterine decidualization
reaction that occurs after implantation was defective,
causing embryos to die at about day 8 (robb et al., 1998). in
another study, mice homozygous for a hypomorphic  xxxg1163xxx 
allele had a retarded decidualization response, in which the
decidua degenerated before the formation of a
chorioallantoic placenta (bilinski et al., 1998). expression of
 xxxg1162xxx  in the pregnant uterus was upregulated at the time of
embryo implantation and in situ hybridization revealed
high expression of  xxxg1162xxx  in cells of the primary decidual
zone (robb et al., 1998). the presence of  xxxg1162xxx  mrna ( xxxg1162xxx ) and  xxxg1162xxx  protein in human endometrial tissues has
been demonstrated. in agreement with studies in mice,
immunoreactive  xxxg1162xxx  was at a maximum concentration in
decidual cells (dimitriadis et al., 2000).
uterine receptivity and the uterine stromal cell
decidualization response are essential for the successful
establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. the
decidualization process, in which uterine stromal cells
undergo transformation in response to the implanting
blastocyst, is particularly marked in species such as rats
and humans in which placentation is characterized by
extensive invasion of trophoblast cells. historically, the
morphological changes that occur during decidualization
have been characterized most extensively in the laboratory
rat (de feo, 1967; o’shea et al., 1983). more recently, gu
and gibori (1995) examined the endocrine functions and
gene expression profiles of rat decidual cells. the present

 xxxg1162xxx  ( xxxg1162xxx ) is a cytokine that is active on a range
of different types of cell. its effects include stimulation of
haematopoietic progenitors, anti-inflammatory actions,
effects on bone remodelling and induction of acute phase
protein secretion by the liver (du and williams, 1997;
schwertschlag et al., 1999). recombinant human  xxxg1162xxx 
(rhil-11) has been licensed as a biopharmaceutical for the
treatment of post-chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopaenia.
studies on a variety of animal models have indicated that
rhil-11 is efficacious in treating acute and chronic
inflammation disorders, such as inflammatory bowel
disease (peterson et al., 1998), hyperoxia and radiationinduced lung damage (redlich et al., 1996; waxman et al.,
1999), sepsis (barton et al., 1996; chang et al., 1996; opal
et al., 1998), and graft versus host disease (hill et al., 1998;
teshima et al., 1999).
 xxxg1162xxx  is a member of a family of cytokines that includes
il-6, leukaemia inhibitory factor (lif),  xxxg1637xxx ,
cardiotropin 1 and ciliary neurotrophic growth factor.
members of this cytokine family signal via a high affinity
receptor complex composed of a ligand binding  xxxg216xxx 
and a common signal transducing subunit, gp130.  xxxg1162xxx 
binds to a complex of  xxxg1162xxx  receptor alpha (il-11ralpha) and gp130.
in mice, a locus encoding a second murine il-11ralpha chain
(il11ra2) has been identified. in contrast to the gene
encoding il-11ralpha ( xxxg1163xxx ), which is expressed
ubiquitously, expression of the gene encoding the second

study reports on cloning of cdnas encoding rat  xxxg1162xxx  and
il-11ralpha and examines the expression of  xxxg1162xxx  in the rat
uterus as it undergoes decidualization in response to the
implanting blastocyst.

materials and methods
cloning of rat  xxxg1162xxx  and  xxxg1163xxx  genes
a sprague–dawley rat testis cdna library (stratagene, la
jolla, ca) was screened with radiolabelled oligonucleotides
for murine  xxxg1162xxx  to isolate cdnas encoding rat  xxxg1162xxx . total
rna was prepared from rat testis using trizol (life
technologies, grand island, ny) and 5⬘ race was
performed using the 5⬘ race kit (life technologies) to
obtain the 5⬘ end of the cdna. the nested gene-specific
primers used were: 5⬘-ttgtggtctccatcagctgggaaat-3⬘, 5⬘-gagggtctgaagacactcgagggg-3⬘ and
5⬘-gccagaggctcagcaccaccagga-3⬘. after nested
amplification, pcr products were cloned into pgem-t easy
(promega, madison, wi). the rat testis cdna library was
screened at reduced stringency with radiolabelled cdna
fragments of murine  xxxg1163xxx  to isolate rat  xxxg1163xxx  cdnas.
purified cdna clones and 5⬘ race products were
sequenced using the prism ready reaction dye deoxy
terminator cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca) on a 373a dna sequencer (applied biosystems).

northern blot analysis
total rna was prepared from rat tissues using trizol (life
technologies) and poly(a+) rna was selected using
oligo(dt) cellulose (roche diagnostics gmbh, mannheim).
northern blot analysis was performed as described by robb
et al. (1996). the filters were hybridized with a [alpha-32p]datplabelled 700 bp  xxxg1162xxx  cdna probe or with a 850 bp  xxxg1163xxx 
cdna probe. each filter was then stripped and rehybridized
with a radiolabelled  xxxg861xxx  cdna fragment.

collection of rat tissues
adult (8–12 week old) female wistar rats were mated and
then killed at timed intervals by co2 inhalation followed
by cervical dislocation for collection of the uterus. midday
of the day on which the vaginal plug was detected was
considered as day 0.5 after mating. samples for rna
preparation were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
–70⬚c before total rna preparation. for uterine samples
collected at days 2.5–4.5 after mating, an oviduct or uterine
horn was flushed to ascertain the presence of fertilized eggs
or blastocysts. for uterine samples collected at day 5.5 after
mating, the presence of implantation sites was ascertained
at the time of collection by administering 200 µl of a 1%
(w/v) solution of chicago sky blue via the tail vein 5 min
before the animals were killed. in addition, a portion of one
uterine horn was cut into serial sections and subsequently
examined using a microscope to confirm the presence of

implantation sites. all procedures were approved by the
animal ethics committee of the royal melbourne hospital.

rnase protection analysis
rnase protection analyses were performed using the
rpaiii kit (ambion inc., austin, tx) as described by robb et
al. (1998). ten micrograms of rna was used in each
hybridization reaction. two independent sets of uterine
tissues from different females with a vaginal plug were
collected and examined for gene expression at each of the
15 time points studied in this analysis. results were
comparable between the two sets of tissues at all time
points. all cdna fragments used as riboprobes were cloned
into pbluescript sk. the rat  xxxg1162xxx  riboprobes were two 257
bp (nucleotides 173–430 and nucleotides 321–578) cdna
fragments. the rat  xxxg1163xxx  riboprobes were 242 bp (nucleotides 666–908) and 319 bp (nucleotides 845–1164)
cdna fragments. the rat lif riboprobe was a 229 bp cdna
fragment (nucleotides 93–322, genbank accession no.
ab010275). the rat gp130 riboprobe was a 260 bp cdna
fragment (nucleotides 1571–1830, genbank accession no.
m92340). a 316 bp fragment of the rat  xxxg861xxx  cdna
(ambion), labelled to 50-fold lower specific activity, was
used to estimate rna loading.

in situ hybridization
tissues were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and were
dehydrated and embedded in paraffin wax. adjacent sections
(5 µm in thickness) from three to six females with a vaginal
plug were processed and hybridized with [alpha-33p]utp-labelled
sense and antisense riboprobes as described by lyons et al.
(1995). similar results were obtained in experiments using
sectioned uteri from different females with vaginal plugs. both
murine and rat  xxxg1162xxx  and  xxxg1163xxx  riboprobes were used. in
both cases, the murine and rat probes gave similar results,
although, in general, background was lower with the rat
probes.

results
cloning of rat genes encoding  xxxg1162xxx  and il-11ralpha
rat  xxxg1162xxx  cdna clones were obtained by screening a rat
testis cdna library with oligonucleotides corresponding to
conserved regions of the murine  xxxg1162xxx  cdna. the 5⬘ end of
the cdna was obtained using 5⬘ race. a composite partial
cdna of 1264 nucleotides with an open reading frame of
600 nucleotides was obtained (genbank accession no.
af34935). the deduced 199 amino acid sequence had 194
of 199 (97%) shared identity with that of the murine
sequence, and 170 of 199 (86%) and 178 of 199 (90%)
shared identity with non-human primate and human  xxxg1162xxx 
sequences, respectively (fig. 1).
in humans, two  xxxg1162xxx  transcripts of 2.5 and 1.5 kb
encode the same functional protein, whereas only a single 2
kb transcript was detected in mouse rna (paul et al., 1990;

kawashima et al., 1991; morris et al., 1996). northern blot
analysis of poly(a+) rna from pregnant rat uterus revealed
a single transcript of approximately 2 kb (fig. 2).
rat  xxxg1163xxx  cdna was obtained by screening a cdna
library of rat testis with a murine  xxxg1163xxx  cdna fragment.
the cdna clones obtained all encoded a single transcript.
the composite rat  xxxg1163xxx  cdna was 1713 nucleotides and
contained an open reading frame of 1296 nucleotides
(genbank accession no. af347936). the deduced 430
amino acid sequence was aligned with that of human and
murine il-11ralpha (fig. 3). the human and rat sequences
shared identity at 346 of 430 residues (80%), and the rat and
murine sequences shared identity at 407 of 430 (95%)
residues. northern blot analysis revealed a single 1.8 kb
 xxxg1163xxx  transcript in all tissues examined (fig. 2).

expression of  xxxg1162xxx ,  xxxg1163xxx  and gp130 during the periimplantation period
total rna was prepared from uteri of rats at sequential
times after detection of a vaginal plug. before implantation,
the presence of blastocysts was confirmed by flushing the
lumen of a portion of each specimen. implantation sites were
detected in uterine samples collected at day 5.5 after mating
using the blue dye reaction (psychoyos, 1973). rnase
protection studies were performed using 10 µg total rna.  xxxg1162xxx  transcripts were detected at a low concentration in the uteri
of virgin rats and at days 0.5–4.5 after mating, whereas at day
5.5 after mating,  xxxg1162xxx  expression was markedly upregulated
(fig. 4). expression of  xxxg1162xxx  remained high up to day 9.5 after
mating. as in mice, expression of lif preceded that of  xxxg1162xxx ,
and was detectable at low concentrations in the uterus of
virgin rats and both before and after implantation. lif
expression was high in uterine samples collected at days
9.5–11.5 after mating, but decreased thereafter. expression of

were obtained using different rna samples and different  xxxg1162xxx  and  xxxg1163xxx  probes.

[alpha-33p]utp-labelled rat  xxxg1162xxx  probes to determine the
spatial expression of  xxxg1162xxx  in the peri-implantation uterus.
expression of  xxxg1162xxx  was first detected in uterine samples
collected at day 5.5 after mating. in all sections examined,
expression of  xxxg1162xxx  was observed in the subepithelial
primary decidual zone adjacent to the apposed blastocyst
(fig. 5). at later time points, expression of  xxxg1162xxx  was
detectable at a low concentration throughout decidual
tissues (not shown).

expression of  xxxg1163xxx  in decidual tissue
in situ hybridization of [alpha-33p]utp-labelled rat  xxxg1163xxx 
riboprobes to uterine sections collected at days 0–11 after
mating was undertaken. hybridization revealed a general
increase in the expression of  xxxg1163xxx  in both decidual and
uterine tissues compared with adjacent sections hybridized
with control sense riboprobes. in preimplantation uteri,
expression of  xxxg1163xxx  was low throughout the uterus. day
5.5 after mating was the only time point at which a more
localized pattern of expression was observed. at this time
point,  xxxg1163xxx  expression was highest in stroma adjacent to
the luminal epithelium (fig. 6a–c). thereafter, widespread

expression of  xxxg1163xxx  was detected throughout decidual and
non-decidual tissues (fig. 6d–f).

discussion
the composite nucleotide sequences of rat  xxxg1162xxx  and  xxxg1163xxx  were determined by sequencing cdna clones
obtained by screening a rat testis cdna library. northern
blot analysis revealed a single 2 kb  xxxg1162xxx  transcript in the
poly(a+) rna prepared from pregnant rat uterus. in other
studies, a single 2 kb transcript was detected in rna
prepared from a murine cell line, whereas a major 2.5 and a
minor 1.5 kb  xxxg1162xxx  transcript were observed in several
human tissues (paul et al., 1990; kawashima et al., 1991;
morris et al., 1996). in humans, the two transcripts arise as a
result of alternative use of two polyadenylation sites located
within the 3⬘ non-coding region of the gene (paul et al.,
1990). however, in mouse and rat tissues examined to date,
it appears that there is only a single  xxxg1162xxx  transcript.
in the present study, cdna clones encoding a second rat
il-11ralpha in a cdna library prepared from rat testis were not
obtained. testis was the major site of expression of the

second il-11ralpha receptor in mice (robb et al., 1997). the
likely absence of the second receptor in rats is in
accordance with previous observations that two, or in some
cases multiple,  xxxg1163xxx  loci arose in some inbred mouse
strains as a result of a recent duplication event. only a
single locus encoding il-11ralpha was found in humans
(nandurkar et al., 1996), in some inbred mouse strains
(robb et al., 1996) and in the wild mouse strain mus spretus
(l. robb, unpublished).
comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of rat
 xxxg1162xxx  with mouse, non-human primate and human  xxxg1162xxx 
revealed that  xxxg1162xxx  was highly conserved among species.
the 21 amino acid signal sequence was also conserved.
rat  xxxg1162xxx , like its human and murine equivalents, is a very
basic protein, rich in proline and leucine and lacking
cysteine residues and n-glycosylation sites. the predicted
amino acid sequence of rat il-11ralpha also showed a high
degree of shared identity among species. the conservation
of il-11and il-11ralpha homologues is in accordance with

studies showing that rhil-11 is active with target cells of
both mice (quesniaux et al., 1993) and rats (yonemura et
al., 1993).
the cloning of rat cdnas encoding  xxxg1162xxx  and its receptor
enabled the expression of these genes in the pregnant rat
uterus to be studied by rnase protection. the levels of
expression of the two receptor components,  xxxg1163xxx  and
gp130, were not significantly altered during the study period.
 xxxg1162xxx  transcripts were detected at a low concentration in the
uteri of virgin rats and in rat uteri collected at days 0.5–4.5
after mating. at day 5.5 after mating, immediately after
implantation, expression of  xxxg1162xxx  was upregulated.
expression of  xxxg1162xxx  was observed up to day 10.5 after mating,
but decreased thereafter. in situ hybridization of uterine
sections collected at day 5.5 after mating showed a marked
localization of  xxxg1162xxx  to the primary decidual zone. this
temporal and spatial pattern of expression of  xxxg1162xxx  and its
receptors in the pregnant uterus was very similar to that
observed in mice (robb et al., 1998). in mice,  xxxg1162xxx

expression was regulated temporally in deciduomata (robb
et al., 1998).  xxxg1162xxx  expression in the decidual cells of mouse
and rat uterus during the peri-implantation period indicates
that the action of this cytokine may be linked to that of other
implantation-specific genes induced by active blastocysts at
the time of the attachment reaction. these genes include

members of the  xxxg681xxx -like growth factor
family, cox-2 and lif (das et al., 1994, 1995, 1997;
chakraborty et al., 1996; lim et al., 1997a, 1998; song et al.,
2000).
lif expression was observed throughout the periimplantation period, preceding the increase in  xxxg1162xxx 

 xxxg1162xxx  and its receptor in rat uterus

expression at day 5.5 after mating. lif was detectable in the
uterus from day 5.5 to day 9.5 after mating and increased at
day 10.5 and day 11.5 after mating. this finding is in
contrast to the pattern of lif expression in mice, in which
lif expression is markedly upregulated at the time of
implantation and decreases thereafter (bhatt et al., 1991;
shen and leder, 1992; robb et al., 1998). in rats, the
choriallantoic placenta is established at about day 10.5 after
mating. lif expression has been observed in murine
placenta, but not in embryos, at day 9.5–12.5 after mating
(conquet and brulet, 1990; bhatt et al., 1991; shen and
leder, 1992). the increase in lif transcription in pregnant
rat uterus at days 10.5 and 11.5 after mating may be due to
expression in placenta; however, in situ hybridization
studies would be required to confirm this contention.
implantation relies on successful development of the
embryo to the blastocyst stage and on steroid hormone
priming of the endometrium to a receptive state (cross et al.,
1994; lim et al., 1997b). at the site of implantation, the
decidual reaction is initiated. the importance of decidualization for successful embryonic survival after implantation is well recognized. although it has been established
that decidualization is regulated, in part, by prostaglandins
(kennedy, 1994), other requirements for a normal decidual
response to the implanting blastocyst are poorly understood. results from this study have shown that, in mice,  xxxg1162xxx  signalling is obligatory for this process, and recent work
demonstrated the localization of  xxxg1162xxx  immunoreactive
protein in human decidual cells and its expression in these
cells before the upregulation of prolactin expression
(dimitriadis et al., 2000). the temporal and spatial pattern
of expression of  xxxg1162xxx  in the rat uterus during the periimplantation period, as demonstrated in this study, supports
the notion that this cytokine is involved in decidualization.
the results also validate the use of rats as a model for future
studies examining the use of  xxxg1162xxx  receptor antagonists as
contraceptive agents.
