overcoming  xxxd2333xxx  (im) resistance and disease persistence in patients
with chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is of
considerable importance to the issue of
potential cure. here we asked whether
autocrine signaling contributes to survival of bcr/ablⴙ cells in the presence
of im and  xxxd2724xxx  (ni; amn107), a novel,
more selective abl inhibitor. conditioned
media (cm) of im-resistant lama84 cell
clones (r-cm) was found to substantially
protect im-naive lama cells and primary
cml progenitors from im- or ni-induced
cell death. this was due to an increased
secretion of the granulocyte-macrophage

 xxxg526xxx  ( xxxd3173xxx ),
which was identified as the causative
factor mediating im resistance in r-cm.
 xxxd3173xxx  elicited im and ni drug resistance via a  xxxg23xxx -independent activation of the janus kinases 2 ( xxxg1220xxx )/signal
transducer and activator of transcription
5 (stat-5) signaling pathway in  xxxd3173xxx 
receptor ␣ receptor ( xxxg527xxx )–expressing
cells, including primary cd34ⴙ/cd116ⴙ
gm progenitors ( xxxg920xxx ). elevated mrna
and protein levels of  xxxd3173xxx  were detected in im-resistant patient samples,
suggesting a contribution of  xxxd3173xxx  secretion for im and ni resistance in vivo.

importantly, inhibition of  xxxg1220xxx  with
 xxxd1557xxx  abrogated  xxxd3173xxx –mediated
stat-5 phosphorylation and ni resistance in vitro. together, adaptive autocrine secretion of  xxxd3173xxx  mediates bcr/
abl-independent im and ni resistance
via activation of the antiapoptotic  xxxg1220xxx /
stat-5 pathway. inhibition of  xxxg1220xxx  overcomes  xxxd3173xxx –induced im and ni progenitor cell resistance, providing a
rationale for the application of  xxxg1220xxx  inhibitors to eradicate residual disease in
cml. (blood. 2007;109:2147-2155)

introduction
 xxxd2333xxx , or im (gleevec; novartis pharma, basel,
switzerland), has demonstrated a remarkable efficacy in the
treatment of  xxxg23xxx ⫹ leukemias, with most patients in early
chronic phase achieving complete cytogenetic remissions (ccrs).1
despite this,  xxxg23xxx ⫹ disease remains detectable in essentially
all patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia
(cml), and cml always recurs after cessation of im treatment.2
this reflects disease persistence under im therapy. mechanisms of
stem and progenitor cell persistence are presumably progenitor cell
quiescence,3,4  xxxg23xxx  overexpression,5  xxxg23xxx  kinase mutations,6 and influx and efflux pump expression7,8 regulating intracellular concentrations of im. however, additional aberrations may be
required to cause a fully drug-resistant phenotype.9
clinically manifest im resistance primarily occurs in advanced
stages of cml and in  xxxg23xxx ⫹ acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(all), and is frequently associated with mutations10-17 in the
causative oncogene of cml,  xxxg23xxx .18,19  xxxg23xxx  kinase
mutations are today the best-characterized im resistance mechanism.
to overcome mutation-dependent im resistance, more selective
second-generation abl kinase inhibitors such as  xxxd2724xxx  (ni;
amn107)20 and  xxxd1815xxx  (da),21 a dual-kinase inhibitor of abl
and src kinases, were developed and recently also introduced into
clinical practice.22,23 however, da and ni failed to achieve

sustained responses in im-resistant cml blast crisis and all.22-24
interestingly, neither the response nor the depth of response to ni
(hematologic or cytogenetic) depended on the presence or absence
of kinase mutations in im-resistant cml and  xxxg23xxx ⫹ all22.
this implies that  xxxg23xxx -independent resistance mechanisms25,26
contribute to im and ni resistance in a major cohort of patients.
using clonal populations of lama cells, we have previously
shown that a  xxxg23xxx -independent activation of the pi3k/akt
signaling cascade precedes kinase mutation–dependent im resistance development in vitro,27 and that this autonomous pathway
activation mediates early  xxxg23xxx -independent im resistance.
others have shown a growth factor–dependent, bcr/ablindependent activation of the ras-signaling pathway in cd34⫹
cml progenitors under im exposure.28 here we were seeking to
identify putative factors present in the culture supernatant of
im-exposed  xxxg23xxx ⫹ cells that confer im resistance.

gies, beverly, ma), and 2.5 ␮l antiphospho– xxxg1220xxx  ( xxxg1220xxx ) (cell
signaling technologies). labeling occurred for 30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark. after first staining, cells were washed twice with
bd pharmingen stain buffer, and secondary staining was performed with 3
␮l fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)–labeled goat anti–rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg) and 3 ␮l streptavidin-apc (bd biosciences). cells were
again washed and resuspended in 500 ␮l of bd pharmingen stain buffer
for fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) analysis on a lsr ii facs
analyzer (bd biosciences). data were analyzed using flowjo software
(treestar, portland, or).

patient samples

conditioned media (cm) was harvested from r- and ur-lama cell clones
by culturing 1 ⫻ 106/ml lama cells in serum-free rpmi-1640 medium
(gibco-brl) containing 4 mm l-glutamine. cm of primary cells was
generated by culturing 1 ⫻ 106/ml peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmcs) in serum-free imdm containing 4 mm l-glutamine and 0.1 mm
hepes. cm was saturated by keeping cells for 24 hours in a humidified
atmosphere at 37°c with 5% co2. supernatant was cleared from contaminating cells by centrifuging twice at 425g for 5 minutes. supernatant was
eventually aliquoted and stored at ⫺80°c for later use.

primary cml progenitor cells were obtained from newly diagnosed
patients in the chronic phase of cml (n ⫽ 6) after written informed consent
during routine bone marrow aspirations performed at diagnosis. peripheral
blood samples (20-40 ml) were obtained during routine diagnostic venal
punctures at diagnosis (table s1, available on the blood website; see the
supplemental materials link at the top of the online article) or at the time of
im-resistant disease (tables s2-s3) from patients treated within multicenter
cml studies in the mannheim or marburg university clinic after the
patients’ written informed consent, with approval of the local ethics
committee in mannheim and marburg. rna extraction and cdna synthesis were performed as previously described.12 mononuclear cells (mncs)
were isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow using  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque
(seromed, biochrom berlin, germany) density gradient centrifugation as
previously described.27
cd34ⴙ enrichment
primary cd34⫹ cml progenitors were enriched from 16 to 24 ml of
heparinzed bone marrow using the magnetic-activated cell sorting (macs)
procedure (miltenyi biotech, bergisch gladbach, germany). briefly, bone
marrow mncs were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs;
gibco-brl, eggenstein, germany) containing 0.2 m edta and 0.25 g/ml
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (macs buffer) and labeled with 100 ␮l anticd34⫹ beads per 108 to 109 mncs. after labeling for 20 minutes at 4°c,
cells were washed 2 times with cold macs buffer, and separation was
performed through 1 ls column as recommended by the manufacturer
(miltenyi biotech).
in vitro treatment with cytokines and inhibitors
 xxxg23xxx ⫹, im-resistant, and im-sensitive lama-84 (lama) cell
clones were maintained as recently described.27 to assess apoptosis or
intracellular signal transduction, lama cells were treated with 1 ␮m im, 1
␮m ni, and 100 ␮m  xxxd1557xxx  for 24 to 48 hours in the presence or absence of
 xxxd3173xxx  (5 ng/ml). primary cd34⫹-enriched cells were cultured for 48
hours in the presence or absence of 3 ␮m ni with or without 100 ␮m
 xxxd1557xxx  in iscove modified dulbecco medium (imdm; hyclone laboratories, logan, ut) containing 4 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm hepes, and
20% fetal calf serum (fcs; gibco-brl) plus 5 growth factors: scf (0.2
ng/ml), il-6 (1 ng/ml),  xxxd3173xxx  (0.2 ng/ml), g-csf (1 ng/ml), and
mip-1␣ (0.2 ng/ml).
intracellular staining
for intracellular staining, 1 to 5 ⫻ 105 stimulated parental lama cells or
primary cd34⫹-enriched cml samples were fixed at 37°c for 10 minutes
using fix buffer i (bd biosciences, heidelberg, germany), and then were
immediately stored at ⫺80°c for future analysis or permeabilized on ice for
30 minutes in 1 ml bd phosflow perm buffer iii (bd biosciences),
washed twice with bd pharmingen stain buffer, and resuspended in 100
␮l bd pharmingen stain buffer; fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were
added as indicated: 5 ␮l anti-cd34 pe-cy7 (8g12), 5 ␮l antiphospho–
signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (stat-5)–pe (y694),

generation of conditioned media

cfc assays
first, 5 ⫻ 105 cd34⫹-enriched primary cml progenitors of untreated
patients with chronic-phase cml (patients no. 3-8; table s1) were grown in
cm of lama cell clones 25r (or 25ur as control) and treated for 72 hours
as indicated in the figure 1 legend in the presence or absence of 10 ␮m ni.
in some experiments, cd34⫹-enriched primary cml progenitors were
treated with 10 ␮m ni for 72 hours in cm derived from primary pbmcs of
im-resistant patients. cm was always supplemented with a 5–growth factor
cocktail (5gf) containing  xxxd3173xxx  (0.2 ng/ml), scf (0.2 ng/ml), il-6 (1
ng/ml), g-csf (1 ng/ml), and mip-1␣ (0.2 ng/ml). alternatively,
cd34⫹-enriched primary cml progenitors were cultured in imdm (4 mm
l-glutamine, 0.1 mm hepes) containing the 5gf plus 20% fcs (gibcobrl), and treated with 10 ␮m ni with or without an additional  xxxd1557xxx 
(100 ␮m) for 72 hours. to test the effect of  xxxd3173xxx , g-csf, or  xxxg1177xxx  (all
from peprotech) on colony-forming cell (cfc) formation, these cytokines
were each individually supplemented  xxxd1891xxx  ng/ml. after treatment, cells
were transferred into semisolid methocult medium (h4230; stemcell
technologies, vancouver, bc, canada) and incubated in triplicate for 14
days in 35 ⫻ 10-mm plates (greiner bio-one, frickenhausen, germany) at
37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 saturation. colonies
were counted under a microscope.
quantitative  xxxd3173xxx  pcr
 xxxd3173xxx  mrna expression levels were analyzed on an abi prism 7700
sequence detector (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) using standardized primers for  xxxd3173xxx  (quantitect primer assay; qiagen, hilden,
germany) validated for use with the quantitect sybr green pcr kit
(qiagen).  xxxg526xxx  expression was normalized by comparison with the
expression of the housekeeping gene  xxxg861xxx  (primer pair: 5⬘-gaa ggt
gaa gtt cgg agt c-3⬘ and 5⬘-gaa gat ggt gat ggg att tc-3⬘).
the amplification conditions were 15 minutes at 95°c to activate hotstartaq dna polymerase (applied biosystems) , then 45 cycles of 94°c for 15
seconds, annealing at 55°c for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°c for 30
seconds. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) efficiencies of the target and
endogenous reference gene were comparable, so that the normalized
 xxxg526xxx  expression was calculated by using using the ⌬⌬ct method.
 xxxd3173xxx  elisa
 xxxd3173xxx  concentration in total protein cell lysates generated from the
peripheral blood cells of im-sensitive and im-resistant patients (table s3)
was quantitated using the human  xxxd3173xxx  enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) kit from diaclone (besançon, france); the detection range
was 8 to 500 pg/ml, and the sensitivity was less than 4.4 pg/ml. briefly,
microtiter wells were washed twice with washing buffer. cell lysate (30 ␮g)

was added per well for each sample in duplicate. horseradish peroxidase
(hrp) conjugate (hrp-conjugated anti– xxxd3173xxx  monoclonal antibody)
was added followed by an incubation on a plate shaker for 3 hours at room
temperature. subsequently, wells were washed, 100 ␮l tmb substrate
solution was added, and the plate was incubated for 20 minutes at room
temperature. finally, 100 ␮l stop solution was added, and the absorbance
was measured on an elisa reader (molecular devices, ismaning,
germany) at 450 nm. the absorbance values of the samples were converted
into concentration values based on the calibration curve.
cytokine antibody array
a cytokine antibody array was performed using the raybio human
cytokine antibody array c series 1000 kit (ray biotech, norcross, ga)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. briefly, 2 membranes
each consisting of 60 cytokine antibodies spotted in duplicates onto the
membranes were blocked with 2 ml 1 ⫻ blocking buffer at room
temperature for 30 minutes. membranes were then incubated with 2 ml
serum-free conditioned media derived from lama subclones 25ur and
25r, respectively, at room temperature for 90 minutes. membranes were
washed 3 times for 5 minutes at room temperature with 2 ml of 1 ⫻ wash
buffer i, and 2 times with 2 ml of 1 ⫻ wash buffer ii according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (ray biotech). membranes were then
exposed for 90 minutes at room temperature to 1 ml of a 1:500 dilution of
biotin-conjugated antibodies. following a thorough wash as before, membranes were incubated with 2 ml 1:1000 diluted hrp-conjugated streptavidin at room temperature for 120 minutes. membranes were washed again
and exposed for 2 minutes to the peroxidase substrate, which was
constituted by mixing 1 ⫻ detection buffer c and 1 ⫻ buffer d in a 1:1
ratio. membranes were exposed to biomax-mr films (eastman kodak,
rochester, ny) for the appropriate times.

cm of im-resistant lama clones mediates im and ni resistance

im at 1 ␮m induces almost complete apoptosis of parental lama
cells.27 to test the effect of culture supernatant (cm) of imresistant lama-84 cell clones27 (r-cm) on im- or ni-induced
apoptosis, r-cm was applied to im-naive lama-84 cells in the
presence of 1 ␮m im or ni. intriguingly, r-cm of the im-resistant
lama cell clones, 14r (harboring a q252h point mutation), 10r,
and 25r, potently protected against im-induced apoptosis, but
also against ni-induced apoptosis (p ⬍ .001; figure 1a). in
contrast, plain fcs or sensitive cm (ur-cm) derived from
im-naive homolog clones (10ur, 14ur, and 25ur) or r-cm of
another im-resistant lama-clone (2r) did not protect against
im-induced apoptosis.

cell proliferation was assessed by using the promega celltiter 96 cell proliferation assay (madison, wi) using the mts (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium) colorimetric reduction method as previously described.27 briefly, 7.5 ⫻ 105/ml lama cells were
cultured in 25r-cm or 25ur-cm and treated with ni (1 ␮m) or not in the
presence or absence of  xxxd3173xxx  with or without neutralizing anti–gm-gsf
antibodies. later (24 hours), 20 ␮l celltiter 96 aqueous one solution reagent
(promega, madison, wi) was added, and cells were cultured for a further 4 hours
at 37°c, 5% co2. absorbance was then measured at 492 nm in an optimax
microplate reader (molecular devices).
apoptosis measurement
apoptosis was measured using the  xxxg166xxx –fitc apoptosis detection kit
(alexis biochemicals, grünberg, germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and essentially as previously described.30 briefly,
5 ⫻ 105 cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, resuspended in 195 ml 1 ⫻
binding buffer, and stained for 10 minutes at room temperature with 5 ml
fitc-conjugated anti– xxxg166xxx  antibody. unbound  xxxg166xxx  antibody
was removed by washing with 1 ⫻ binding buffer. cells were stained
immediately prior to facs measurement on a facscan (bd biosciences,
heidelberg, germany) with 20 ␮g/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi). data were
analyzed using cellquest pro software v4.0.2 (bd biosciences). pi and
 xxxg166xxx  double-negative cells were counted as viable.
im and ni resistance induction assay
medium (200 ml) containing 4 ⫻ 105/ml parental lama cells were
cultured in 96-well plates in the presence of im or ni at 2 ␮m in the
absence or presence of  xxxd3173xxx  at 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 ng/ml. the
concentrations of im and ni were increased to 3 ␮m after 72 hours and to 4
␮m after 96 hours. colonies that formed on the bottom of the wells 10 to 14
days after initiation of treatment were counted.
western blotting
protein gel electrophoresis and western blotting was performed essentially
as previously described27,30 using the following purchased antibodies:

in the presence of im or ni. activated (phosphorylated)  xxxg23xxx  kinase (p-bcr/
abl) was demonstrated by staining for p- xxxg23xxx  and the phosphorylated direct
substrate of  xxxg23xxx , p-crkl. activation of the  xxxg23xxx -substrate, stat-5, was
shown using phospho-stat-5 (p-stat-5)–specific antibodies. actin served as
loading control.

to ask whether r-cm induced im and ni resistance exclusively
in lama cells, we next also tested r-cm on k562 cells and
primary cd34⫹ cml progenitors. it has previously been established that im and da selectively inhibit proliferation of cml
cfcs in vitro5,31,32 although inefficient in k562 cells (k562 cells
do not express  xxxg527xxx ; not shown), 25r-cm clearly overcame
ni-mediated growth inhibition of primary cd34⫹-enriched progenitor samples from patients with first-diagnosis chronic-phase cml
(n ⫽ 3). this was illustrated by a 6.9-fold (⫾ 3.5 standard deviation [sd]) increase in the number of cml cfcs surviving ni
exposure through the presence of 25r-cm instead of 25ur-cm
(figure 1b; table s1). notably, cm derived from an im-resistant
patient (patient no. 1; table s1) was (87-fold) more potent than
25ur control cm in overcoming cfc inhibition by ni (figure
1b). together, these experiments suggested that factors were

next, we asked whether 14r and 25r-cm–induced im/ni resistance was  xxxg23xxx  dependent.  xxxg23xxx  kinase activation
status was assessed using western blotting for detection of
phosphorylated  xxxg23xxx  (p- xxxg23xxx ) and crk-like protein
(p-crkl). activation of another key  xxxg23xxx  substrate, stat-5,
was also evaluated (figure 2). neither r- nor ur-cm interfered
with the inhibition of  xxxg23xxx  by im or ni (figure 2). in fact, ni
completely dephosphorylated  xxxg23xxx  (and crkl), indicating
that 14r/25r-cm–mediated resistance was  xxxg23xxx  independent. in contrast, stat-5 phosphorylation was exclusively blocked
in the presence of 14ur/25ur-cm (figure 2), but not 14r/25rcm. thus, 14r/25r-cm–induced im and ni resistance was
associated with a  xxxg23xxx -independent activation of stat-5.
 xxxd3173xxx  is causal for ni resistance induction by 25r-cm

stat-5 is a common antiapoptotic and transforming target of
 xxxg23xxx  and jaks.33-35 cytokines, upon binding to their receptors, activate members of the jak family (eg,  xxxg1219xxx ,  xxxg1220xxx ,
 xxxg1221xxx , and  xxxg2364xxx  [ xxxg2364xxx ]), and, subsequently, stat-5.35
we hypothesized that the resistance-mediating factor in r-cm
could be a cytokine. a number (120) of cytokines were screened by
cytokine array for differential expression between 25ur- and
25r-resistant medium. the concentrations of  xxxd3173xxx , il-6,
 xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ), il-8, and vascular

 xxxd3173xxx , when supplemented into 25ur-cm, conferred ni resistance to parental lama cells (figure 3b), indicating that  xxxd3173xxx 
was sufficient to mediate ni resistance. in fact, adding anti–rhgmcsf antibodies, which neutralize  xxxd3173xxx  in 25r-cm, caused a
dose-dependent reduction of the capability of 25r-cm to confer ni
resistance to lama cells (figure 3c). moreover, addition of
 xxxd3173xxx  into 25ur-cm dose-dependently restored the biochemical phenotype of 25r-cm, namely, a  xxxg23xxx -independent
stat-5 phosphorylation of parental lama cells in the presence of
ni (figure 3d). together,  xxxd3173xxx  was identified as being
involved in conferring  xxxg23xxx -independent im and ni resistance by 25r-cm.
 xxxg23xxx -independent activation of stat-5 by  xxxd3173xxx 
in lama cells—role of  xxxg527xxx  expression

 xxxd3173xxx  is a hematopoietic cytokine regulating proliferation and
survival of normal  xxxg920xxx ,36,37 and its aberrant secretion may also
be implicated in the pathogenesis of cml.38,39 the data shown in
figures 2 and 3 indicated that  xxxd3173xxx –induced stat-5 activation
substitutes for the loss of  xxxg23xxx -mediated stat-5 activation
by ni. we sought to verify this on the single-cell level by
multicolor facs using a combined intracellular and extracellular
staining. intracellular p-crkl levels (ic-p-crkl) as a marker of
 xxxg23xxx  activation and the ic-p-stat-5 levels were concomitantly measured. it was confirmed that ni effectively blocked
 xxxg23xxx  in the presence or absence of  xxxd3173xxx  (figure 4a; top
histograms), and that stat-5 inhibition by ni was overcome by
 xxxd3173xxx  (figure 4a; bottom histograms). we also noted that
 xxxg527xxx  ␣ chain ( xxxg527xxx ) expression was critical for the
regulation of stat-5 by  xxxd3173xxx . an arbitrary discrimination
between cd116low- (yellow) and cd116high (blue)–expressing
lama cells revealed higher basal stat-5 activation in the
cd116high population (figure 4bi; right histogram) and a further
increase of ic-p-stat-5 by  xxxd3173xxx  exclusively in cd116high cells
(figure 4bii; right histogram). on the contrary,  xxxg527xxx  expression
did not influence ni-mediated p-stat-5 inhibition in the absence

 xxxd3173xxx –dependent imatinib and  xxxd2724xxx  resistance

2151

of  xxxd3173xxx  (figure 4bii; left histogram). the scatter characteristics would support the conclusion that  xxxd3173xxx  maintained
viability (oval gate) in the presence of ni, preferably in the
cd116high (blue), but not the cd116low population (yellow) (figure
4biii), demonstrating that  xxxd3173xxx  via binding to its receptor
 xxxg527xxx  protected against ni-induced apoptosis. in an attempt to
address whether  xxxd3173xxx  supports long-term survival of bcr/
abl⫹ cells in the presence of ni or im, we adapted a previously
reported cell-based in vitro resistance induction assay.40 in this
assay, higher levels of im (4 ␮m) are used to provoke resistance
development.27,40 therefore,  xxxd3173xxx  was added at variable
concentrations to 96-well plates each containing 4 ⫻ 105 cells in
the presence of ni or im at 4 ␮m. readout after 14 to 30 days was
the number of colonies that emerged (figure 4c). this showed that
 xxxd3173xxx  dose-dependently maintained survival, but also the
growth of lama cells in the presence of high doses of im or ni
(figure 4c).
 xxxg1220xxx  inhibition antagonizes  xxxd3173xxx –mediated stat-5
activation in lama cells

we next reasoned that blocking  xxxd3173xxx  receptor signaling (eg, by
inhibition of a main downstream target kinase,  xxxg1220xxx ) may
antagonize ic-p-stat-5 formation, thereby overcoming  xxxd3173xxx –
mediated ni resistance.  xxxd1557xxx  is a previously described  xxxg1220xxx 
inhibitor that is used at a concentration of 50 to 100 ␮m in
vitro.29,41 western blotting indicated that 100 ␮m  xxxd1557xxx  caused a
complete inhibition of  xxxg1220xxx  activation (phosphorylation) in
lama cells (not shown).  xxxg1220xxx  activation was therefore quantitated by facs-based intracellular staining in the presence and
absence of 100 ␮m  xxxd1557xxx  with or without  xxxd3173xxx . whereas
 xxxd3173xxx  activated  xxxg1220xxx  regardless of the presence of ni (figure
5a),  xxxd1557xxx  completely prevented  xxxg1220xxx  activation. this translated into a reduction of  xxxd3173xxx –induced stat-5 activation
(reduction of ic-p-stat-5; figure 5b), and, as expected, severely
reduced the potential of  xxxd3173xxx  to confer im or ni resistance.

 xxxd3173xxx –induced ni resistance of primary cml progenitors is
associated with a  xxxg23xxx -independent activation of stat-5

im and da selectively inhibit proliferation of cml cfcs in
vitro.5,31,32 initial experiments with r-cm suggested that primary
cml progenitors were protected from im-induced growth inhibition due to the presence of higher concentrations of  xxxd3173xxx  in
25r-cm (figure 1b).  xxxd3173xxx  was therefore tested directly in
colony assays for its ability to mediate ni resistance of primary
cd34⫹-enriched cml progenitors derived from 4 consecutive
patients with cml in chronic phase. ni  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m achieved a
maximum growth inhibition in this assay and was therefore used as
standard concentration in colony formation experiments.  xxxd3173xxx 
still potently protected against ni-induced growth inhibition of
 xxxg23xxx ⫹ primary cml precursors (figure 6a). interestingly,

blood, 1 march 2007 䡠 volume 109, number 5

 xxxd3173xxx  was obviously more effective than  xxxg1177xxx  or g-csf in
overcoming ni-mediated growth inhibition (figure 6a). the
latter 2 cytokines were tested in parallel because they have been
reported previously to cause abnormal progenitor cell proliferation in cml42.
we next analyzed the  xxxd3173xxx –associated signal transduction
events that were associated with ni resistance in primary progenitors. gating for cd34⫹/cd116high versus cd116low expression
established that stat-5 activation by  xxxd3173xxx  depended on the
expression of the  xxxd3173xxx  receptor ( xxxg527xxx ). the ic-p-stat-5
levels increased exclusively in the cd116high (r2) population, but
not in the cd116low (r1) population (figure 6b). notably,  xxxg526xxx –induced ic-p-stat-5 formation was not inhibited by ni
(figures 6b, s1), but only the  xxxg1220xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1557xxx  (figures 6b,
s1). in turn, ni effectively blocked  xxxg23xxx  kinase activation as
documented by a  xxxd3173xxx – and  xxxg527xxx  expression–independent
down-regulation of ic-p-crkl (figures 6b, s1). apparently, the
 xxxg23xxx -independent stat-5 activation translated into a significant increase in cfc numbers in the presence of ni (figure s2).
this result was confirmed in another patient sample (patient no. 3;
figure 6c). inhibition of  xxxg1220xxx  by  xxxd1557xxx  reduced the levels of
ic-p-stat-5 (figures 6b, s1) and abolished the protective effect of
 xxxd3173xxx  against ni treatment (figure 6c). thus, bcr/ablindependent activation of stat-5 by  xxxd3173xxx  contributes to
 xxxg23xxx -independent ni resistance in primary cml progenitors.
blocking  xxxg1220xxx  may antagonize this type of resistance.
overexpression of  xxxd3173xxx  in im-resistant patients

we then asked whether  xxxd3173xxx  might also contribute to im
resistance development in vivo. we reasoned that if adaptive
autocrine  xxxd3173xxx  secretion would be a relevant resistance/
persistence mechanism in vivo by improving growth or survival,
 xxxd3173xxx –overexpressing clones would expand out during manifest im resistance. indeed, when comparing  xxxg526xxx  mrna

or pbmcs (n ⫽ 11) of patients with untreated chronic-phase cml
with the peripheral blood samples of 29 im-resistant patients,

 xxxg526xxx  mrna was substantially overexpressed in 5 (17%) of 29
im-resistant patients (figure 7a; table s2). increased  xxxd3173xxx 
was independent from the kinase mutation status and was also not
related to the phase of disease at the time of resistance (figure 7b;
table s2).  xxxd3173xxx  overexpression at the time of im resistance
was even more obvious when  xxxd3173xxx  protein levels were studied.
elevated amounts of  xxxd3173xxx  were detected in more than half of
the im-resistant patients (p ⫽ .007; figure 7b; table s3). notably,
cm derived from the mononuclear cells of patient no. 1 (patient
marked with “#” in figure 7a-b; tables s1-s2) caused an even
greater (8 times) expansion of im-naive, cd34⫹ cml cfcs in the
presence of ni than did 25r-cm (figure 1b).

discussion
the rational development and successful clinical application of
second-generation abl inhibitors such as ni and da demonstrates
that the understanding of molecular mechanisms of im resistance is
of decisive clinical value.22,23 in contrast, disease persistence and
its significance for the development of outright clinical resistance is
still little understood. primary cml cd34⫹ progenitor cells are
growth inhibited but supposedly not killed in vitro by im4,31,32 or
da5 in vitro. this may be due to an inherent inhibitor resistance of
quiescent progenitors and  xxxg23xxx  overexpression.5 kinase
mutations6 as well as drug influx and efflux regulations leading to

low intracellular concentrations of im may also contribute to
persistence.7,8 together, most im resistance and persistence models
are in line with a concept of  xxxg23xxx -dependent survival. here
we identified that autosecretion of  xxxd3173xxx , a hematopoietic
cytokine, conferred  xxxg23xxx -independent ni and im resistance
by activating  xxxg1220xxx /stat-5.
aberrant production of hematopoietic cytokines, particularly
 xxxg1177xxx , but also g-csf and  xxxd3173xxx , has long been suggested to
play a role in cml biology.38,42,43  xxxg1177xxx  and  xxxd3173xxx  were
initially reported to cause autocrine growth loops in certain
 xxxg23xxx ⫹ cell lines.38,39 in addition, mice that received
transplants of  xxxg23xxx -transduced bone marrow showed elevated  xxxg1177xxx  and  xxxd3173xxx  levels,43 and  xxxd3173xxx  was also
elevated in the serum of patients with cml.44 compelling
evidence was then provided for  xxxg1177xxx  and g-csf as mediators of
autocrine growth loops in primary human cml cd34⫹ cells,
leading to activation of stat-5.42 this altogether established
that autocrine stimulation via g-csf,  xxxg1177xxx , and  xxxd3173xxx  could
be of pathophysiologic relevance in cml by regulating progenitor cell growth and survival.
we describe here a potential novel role for autocrine  xxxd3173xxx 
secretion as a counterregulatory mechanism of  xxxg23xxx ⫹ cells to
resist im and ni. in different cell systems, we showed that the
 xxxd3173xxx –mediated  xxxg1220xxx /stat-5 pathway activation circumvents the need for  xxxg23xxx  signaling to maintain survival or

proliferation, and hence that the leukemic population itself activates  xxxg1220xxx  signaling via autocrine secretion of  xxxd3173xxx . interestingly, only  xxxd3173xxx , and to a lesser extent also  xxxg1177xxx , but none of
the other tested cytokines ( xxxg357xxx , il-6, il-8, vegf, g-csf),
overcome ni-mediated cfc inhibition (figure 6a). both  xxxd3173xxx 
and  xxxg1177xxx  are similar in that they are strong inducers of  xxxg1220xxx /
stat-5, which are critical antiapoptotic and transforming targets of
 xxxg23xxx .34,45
since the antiapoptotic and mitogenic effects of  xxxd3173xxx  are
strictly  xxxg527xxx  expression dependent (figures 4, 6b),  xxxg920xxx 
expressing  xxxg527xxx  are supposedly the protected targets in the
presence of  xxxd3173xxx . this could be biologically particularly
interesting because  xxxg920xxx  supposedly constitute a progenitor
population which, after acquisition of respective mutations, constitutes the leukemic, self-renewing stem cell population in cml
blast crisis (figure 7c).46
the mechanism of adaptive  xxxd3173xxx  overexpression in response to im exposure is unclear at present. however, it is known
that expression changes are easier to achieve by tumor cells than
strategic genetic alterations such as de novo  xxxg23xxx  kinase
mutations.47 thus,  xxxd3173xxx  overexpression/secretion in response
to im selection pressure could be an early resistance mechanism
before kinase mutations emerge. in turn, at the time of manifest im
resistance,  xxxd3173xxx  may even become dispensable as a resistance
factor, and its expression may be switched off. this is seen in some
of the lama cell clones that we have studied for  xxxd3173xxx 
expression in a longitudinal manner.27 lack of  xxxd3173xxx  overexpression at the time of outright im resistance in vivo (eg, in the
presence of kinase mutations) would reflect this in vitro observation (figure 7a).
since  xxxd3173xxx  is not only secreted by cml cells (before44 and
in response to im exposure), but also by  xxxg23xxx ⫺ cell types
(figure 7c), progenitor clones that do not themselves up-regulate
 xxxd3173xxx  could be protected by paracrine stimulation. in fact, we
also found evidence for stat-5 activation of lama cells when
testing cm collected ex vivo from the pmbc samples of patients
with cml in complete remission, indicating that paracrine secretion from  xxxg23xxx ⫺ cells could be a relevant source for  xxxd3173xxx 
at the time of complete remission (not shown). thus,  xxxd3173xxx —
regardless of cellular source—can protect primary cml progenitors from im- and ni-induced proliferation inhibition.

the data presented here may have significant clinical implications. since inhibition of  xxxg1220xxx  blocks  xxxd3173xxx  and supposedly
also alternative auto-/paracrine signaling,  xxxg1220xxx  inhibitors may
overcome cytokine-dependent im and ni resistance.
according to this model, a combined inhibition of  xxxg23xxx 
and  xxxg1220xxx  may be a more effective treatment also for im-sensitive
patients by inducing deeper molecular remissions and by reducing
the risk for disease progression. this extends the role of  xxxg1220xxx 
from a transforming target41,45 to a mediator of im/ni resistance in
 xxxg23xxx ⫹ leukemias.
